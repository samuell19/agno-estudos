Where the hell is everyone? We have to get going. Fall break's not waiting on us. What's the big deal? We have five days off and we're only driving a couple hours. Well, well, well, the gang's all here. Why don't you hop, slide or whatever you do to get in the car. Real funny. I try. What's your problem? Nothing, why? Not sitting in the front seat? I wasn't planning on it. Good that's for current girlfriends, not ex-bitches. You're such a jerk. It's a long drive, can't we all get along? Okay Mr. Rogers, let's get our happy asses in the car. Come on. Hello? Where is everybody? Jesus. The hell's your problem? I dozed off. I had a bad dream. Well keep it to yourself. You okay? You gave us quite a fright. Sorry. What were you dreaming about? A clown, he lunged at me. Gonna go off and join the circus? I was researching urban legends for a term paper before we left. It must've got to me. What does that have to do with clowns? There's a legend about a killer in a clown mask who attacks and kills the people of Camp Blood. If that doesn't sound like a horror movie I don't know what does. Lot's of people have gone missing in this area. Yeah, who says so? Lay off her Drake, she's only telling us what she read. Ooh, getting soft on the girls now? Figures. Well enough about the clowns. We can make better time if we take this road. Are you sure? Positive. Whatever. It'll cut 45 minutes off our drive by taking this road. 45 minutes I don't have to spend with you? Sounds good to me. Hey, that guy looks like he needs a ride. And he's cute too. Maybe I'll run him down. Pull over, let's see if he needs anything. Hey there. You look lost, do you need help? Well thanks, I'm just headed up north. On foot? I enjoy hiking. Well we can lighten your load a few miles, hop in. The man said he likes to walk. I could use some rest before it gets dark. I'm Bishop. I'm Ginny, this is Lizzie, Anna, Terry and Drake. Howdy. It's not often you find people on these roads walking. Lay off Anne, can't you see his wedding ring? He's married. Oh, where's Mrs. Bishop? She's gone. Man, sorry. No that's okay. She turned up missing in these parts and the police haven't found any clues to her whereabouts so I'm searching myself. I told you people go missing in these woods. Lay off Liz. No she's right. She's so right. How long ago did she turn up missing? A few months. I have to find out what happened to her. It may help solve other incidents in these parts if I can figure out what's going on. And the police don't have a problem with you going all Scooby Doo? They closed the case, I'm on my own. Alright everybody out to stretch. Except you Terry. Funny, I'll wait here. $5 for a bundle of fucking firewood? Yeah right, I'm just gonna take it. You wasn't planning on taking that without paying was you? I think he was, I heard him say it. That's five bucks Mister. Easy man he was only joking. I ain't laughing, so it mustn't have been a joke. He wasn't joking, if we hadn't seen them pull up they'd have made off with all of our profits. We don't take to kindly to you city folk trying to take advantage of us. Was you trying to take advantage of us? No sir. Well at least she's got some manners. A tad bit ugly, but polite. It's cool man, we're leaving. You'd best be on your way, now. Dumb kids. I have a feeling we haven't seen the last of them yet. They better keep clear of us. You better keep a sober eye on everything that's going on around here. What are you babbling about? The murders, the folks disappearing idiot. Don't you read the paper? Don't read, only look at the pictures. Let's get going, the shop needs minding. Way to go, we almost got shot. They wouldn't shoot us. They looked serious. I'm glad I stayed in the car. Your big mouth is always getting us into trouble. Yeah and you don't know when to keep your big mouth shut. Well enough, it's done and over with. The clown, I see him. What? Behind the trees staring at us. You're just spooked, that's alright. Crazy is a better word for it. I swear I saw something. Thanks folks, have a safe trip. Can we get out? I could use the sights to add some descriptive text to my term paper. Why the hell not? We're getting nowhere fast anyways. Which way Paul Bunyan? I hope you find out what happened to your wife. Thanks, me too. Do you really believe all this bullshit about the clown? I don't know what to believe anymore but I hope to find some answers. Look a lake. It's so pretty, so peaceful. If we brought our swimsuits we could take a dip. Lame idea. Look. I guess Lizzie was right. Suddenly this place doesn't look so nice. It was really called Camp Blood? Who would send their kids to a place called Camp Blood? It was originally called Camp Blackwood, but it's been closed for a really long time. You guys better be getting along. I see some cabins over there, let's check them out. No we better not. Oh come on, let's go. I guess I don't have a say in the matter. You're right. I wouldn't send my kids here. Don't worry, you're not having kids. We should be getting back. I'd better walk you to your car, then I'll head out. You're really gonna camp out here in these woods? Yeah, you should try it some time. Maybe I would if I were with the right person. You are dangerous. You look like a brave fellow. I'd have thought you'd see it as a challenge. It's a shame this place fell into ruin. Maybe someone will try to reopen it again. I can see the brochure already. If you hate your kids send them to the newly reopened Camp Blood. Where's my fucking car? Oh shit. What are we gonna do? It's getting dark. It sounds like a storm is coming. Great, just great. Calm down, we'll figure this out. Alright Chuck Norris. You're not the one who's car just got stolen. Let's go back to the garage. Bad idea, we weren't exactly welcome there. Let's call the police, this is ridiculous. How can anyone else even be out this far? We're too far out for a signal. Look let's go back to the cabins and spend the night. We can sort this out in the morning. Trust me the woods is no place to get caught in a storm. I don't know man. We can't stay here, we need shelter. What if Liz's crazy clown is out here roaming around? Hardly, I wouldn't be surprised if the garage owners were behind this. Well maybe, but we can't stand here and talk. Alright. Come on let's go. I hope the owners don't mind us squatting in their property. Screw the owners, I hope they pick a fight with me. Actually the state owns the property now. The original owners defaulted on their loan. I hope a cop does show up asking questions. I'll get him on the task of finding my car pronto. We'll be lucky if anyone shows up. Oh my god. What is it? Someone just passed by the window. If you'd get your eyes off that smut for two seconds you'd notice when prowlers are going by. Well? Well what? Get out and see who it is. What for? It could be those kids come back to steal our wood again. We scared them off. They ain't showing their faces around here again. Oh is that right genius and just how do you know that? I just do, a man's intuition. You don't even know what that word means. Now get your ass out there and find out who is trespassing. Asshole. Bitch, there ain't nothing out here. It's all there. That woman is wacked. Alright who's there? Come out. If you come out now I won't hurt you too badly. We'd better gather some wood while it's still light out. Aye aye captain. Oh yeah, that's what I like, a man who isn't afraid of putting his back into something. Jeb! Where are you? You better not be sneaking some booze, the doctor says it's bad for your kidney. That idiot will be the death of me. So is there anything by the wood pile or not? Oh my god. When I get my hands on the person that stole my vehicle I'm gonna strangle them. Let's just get through tonight and worry about that tomorrow. That sounded final. She's worried and she has every right to be. Do you think this is a coincidence? What are you rambling about? His stolen car, the clown I saw, his missing wife. I'm not ashamed to tell you that I'm scared. I'm a little creeped out too. We'll be okay as long as we keep our heads and stick together. Yeah as long as we don't lose our heads. You guys sound like a bunch of two year olds. Killer clowns? I wouldn't totally dismiss Lizzie's feelings. This place does have a reputation. Is this place closed because of the supposed murders? Actually yes. People stopped sending their kids here when they heard about murders and people disappearing. Two camp councilors wound up dead. And Camp Blackwood was officially closed. And became Camp Blood. And we're stuck right in the middle of it, great. I hate to be a nuisance but I really need to pee. Then go. I can't make it through the brush. I hauled your ass around all day. Someone else can do it. Oh for Pete's sake I'll do it. Thanks. If you're not back in 10 minutes we'll send a search party after you just in case you meet the killer clown. You're such an asshole. You know behind every urban legend is a grain of truth. Time sometimes dispels it or adds to it. But you have to wonder what makes a serial killer. Simple, they're crazy. It's more than just that. It's about domination. It's always about domination with you. Well she's right, most killers do what they do for the thrill of total and complete control over someone's life. They're crazy, like Lizzie said. Insanity plays a part in it for sure, but it's the thrill of the kill that drives someone to finish someone's life. Could you kill someone Bishop? Depends. On what? If I ever face the person or persons who had a part in my wife's disappearance then I'll know. Thanks for helping my Ginny. I know a person in a wheelchair's a real downer. Wait, you're in a wheelchair, I never knew. You're a class A act. Most people see me as a burden, I can sorta see why. You shouldn't talk like that about yourself. You're a really fun guy. Yeah, a barrel of laughs, every woman wants me. Well it doesn't matter if every woman wants you just as long as one does. Where is she then? Not out here in these woods, that's for sure. Do you have a boyfriend Ginny? I'm seeing a guy off and on, mostly off. He has a football scholarship so most of his focus is on sports. That's too bad. He's really short changing himself. Any guy would be lucky to have a girl like you by his side. What was that for? For being a really nice guy. You know what you can take me out to pee any day. Well it's not like we're engaged or anything. Well this is as good a spot as any. You can wait right over there, I'll only be a minute. Unless you'd like to help? You're on your own Terry, I'll be right over there. Okay. What's wrong, you scared me to death. And I pissed on myself. Ginny you okay? Yeah, just startled, let's get back. You didn't see a bear did you? No, I don't know what I saw actually. Because if it was a bear I wouldn't be mad if you ran and left me behind because that's what I would do if I could run. Don't worry, it wasn't a bear. Let's just get back to the fire. What's up with her? I don't know, something startled her. You look like you pissed yourself. Did Ginny not get a good enough grip on it? Very funny. We'd better all stay in the same cabin. That's a bummer. Fine by me. Damn it, the jerk probably wouldn't pick up anyways. What's wrong, what upset you? Nothing, don't worry about it. Was it the clown? It wasn't anything, an animal or something darted out and frightened me. Can't a girl be frightened? Well sure, no worries. Thanks, I feel better having you around. Sorry Ginny, I've been thinking that all along. Whatever Anna, that's not what I meant. I hope not. Bishop the lady killer. We're gonna have to post guards to keep you at bay. That won't be necessary. I'm looking for my wife remember? Alright then. Oh shit. Let's get inside. The cabin on the right should be fine. Hurry. I'm glad I always keep this thing handy. Well, this isn't a home, but this will have to do. Everyone find something and make yourself comfortable. I call dibs on the recliner. What, it was a joke. Ha ha. Where are you sleeping Bishop? Over there in the corner. Lay off it Anna. No harm. Goodnight John boy, goodnight Mary Allen. Can it, let's get some sleep. Who's there? I saw you. My mind must be playing tricks on me. Hello? Bishop, Bishop are you awake? What is it Anna? I know this might sound weird, but I'm frightened. I was wondering if you would hold me, just for a little while? There's nothing to be afraid of, we're all safe. Besides what would your boyfriend think? Ex-boyfriend, and who cares? It's a really bad idea. Maybe another time. Five minutes then? Fine. Suit yourself, but do let me know if you change your mind when you get cold and lonely. Terry where are you man? Come on answer us, where are you? Terry! Terry! I woke up last night to close the door. It was slightly ajar. Did you notice if Terry was still in the room? No, I didn't really think to look for anyone. I went back to sleep for a little while and then I tried to get you to comfort me or did you forget? Well he couldn't have gone far by himself and why would he leave? It doesn't make any sense at all, something is wrong. She's right. Knock it off with this clown business, alright. He probably went to take a piss and fell over somewhere. Here's what we're gonna do. I'm gonna hike to the general store and get help. You guys stay here and look for Terry. No, I want to go with you, we shouldn't split up. No I can make faster time by myself. Besides Terry needs you, I'll be fine. Yeah, alright. How long are you gonna take? Oh and hour or so to get there. Quicker on the way back with a set of wheels. Once you find him get to the road and stay there. Sounds like a good idea, okay. Here take this. Won't you need it? I'll be fine. Good luck man. Thanks I'll need it. If you were only half the man he is. He's not interested. Why can't you get that through your thick skull? Oh yeah, how do you know we didn't do something last night under your nose right while you slept? Because I would've known. Oh yeah, how ex-boyfriend? Because you're such a lousy lay he would've been snoring one minute in. Alright let's start searching. Shouldn't we split up? No, we'll form a line and go in this direction. It's the best way his chair could've gone. Let's do it. Now I wish I would've kept that knife. Now I'm getting jumpy. Terry? Come on Terry where are you man? Terry! Terry! Answer us, where are you? Terry! He's not out here anywhere. The rain would've washed away his tracks. Maybe he didn't come out here after all. What are you getting at? Maybe he went to one of the cabins instead. But he would've heard us calling. Not if he's injured. She's right. We haven't checked any of the out buildings yet. Well let's go check it out. Terry where are you? Nothing. No sign of him either. I only found some old junk. I didn't see him. Damn, where could he be? It's not like got abducted by aliens. We'll find him, chill. If he's not in the woods and he's not in the cabins where can he be? The lake, we haven't checked the lake. Oh god, what if he fell in the water? Terry? Terry. Oh man this doesn't look good. Terry! Terry! Terry come on. Come on where are you? Terry. Terry! Any other ideas? I think we should do like Bishop said and find the road. We can look for Terry once we get help. We may never make it out alive. Shut up Anna, you're not helping matters. I'm just saying what everyone else is thinking. Terry is dead. Enough, you don't know that. Yes we do. That clown, the Camp Blood murderer killed him last night and dragged him away. We're lucky it wasn't one of us. Let's just get to the road. It's watching, waiting to pick us off one by one. It won't get me, it won't get me. Ann, enough, stop. We should've stayed with Bishop. He seemed to know what he was doing. Oh you'd like that wouldn't you. Stop it, both of you. You're just jealous that I had feelings for him and not you. I'd say you were in heat. That's it, I'm out of here. I'm gonna go find Bishop and you guys can stay here and die. Don't touch me. Screw you guys. Give her a minute. She'll be back once she comes to her senses. This did not go well. I'll find Bishop, they'll see. She's not coming back. She'll be back, she has nowhere else to go. She's nuts, trust me I know. You're the one that slapped her. Don't let her fool you, she's in to that, a real weirdo. We aren't leaving her here by herself. Would you want us to do that to you? Being alone sounds pretty good right now. Go get her, right now. No I'm not going. Go get her and we can all make it to the road together. Drake do it. She hates my guys, she won't listen to me, she never did. We can't manhandle her if she goes psycho, you can. She headed towards the lake. Alright, alright, I'll be back. If she's unconscious when I get here though it's not my fault. Who cares, go get her. Some fall break this is. Stupid crazy bitches, all of 'em. Anne! Come on Anne I didn't mean to slap you. We have to go, I don't want to leave you behind. What's taking him so long? Maybe the clown got him too. Stop it with the clown stuff. He's real and he's out there. The Camp Blood clown is just an urban legend, and just that, emphasis on legend, tales handed down, not facts. Believe what you want, but I know he's the real deal. Okay, suppose that you're right. Why would you suppose that it's a he? 'Cause men are assholes and statistically they're more likely to be serial killers than women. Huh look at your first name. What about it? You share the same name as woman who butchered her mother and father with an ax in Fall Brook Massachusets, Lizzie Borden. Welcome to the club. That doesn't make me a murderess. And stupid tales don't make a clown a real killer either. Whatever, do you think Drake will find Anna? I hope so, we need to get to the road and meet Bishop otherwise we're gonna be stumbling around these woods looking for one another. I just want to get home to my own bed and just forget about this nightmare. I think we all want that Lizzie. I feel so responsible for this whole mess. Why do you say that? Because if I hadn't insisted that we follow Bishop so I could get some great pictures we would've been on our way and the car wouldn't have been stolen. Well it's too late to worry about that now isn't it? Blood, but from what? Anna? Anna! Anna! Anna! Anna! Anna, Anna! Anna! Damn this isn't looking good. Terry? Terry. Ter-- Damn, where am I? Maybe we should go look for him. Yeah, you're right. Wait, there is that Anna? It is. Anna, over here. Anna! Come on she can't here us. Help me. The clown. Run! Run! Where are we going? Just keep running. It's right behind us. Which way, I don't even know where we're going. Run! Which way, I don't even know where we're going. Just move! Help me. Come on get up. Move. We're never gonna make it. In there, hurry. We'll be sitting ducks. We don't have a choice. Move. Stay down, out of the sight of the windows. He's gonna know we're in here. Not if he can't see or hear us. Don't go, stay, it's safe in here. No, one of us can distract him while the other gets away. That's crazy. It's the only way, you know it. Well I don't, I don't know about this. Look he can only go after one of us, that means one of us can get away. What's the plan? We'll burst out the door. I'll distract him and run towards the lake. You run as fast as you can to the woods and to the road. Okay, be careful. You too, come on. Run! No. You want me. That's it, come and get me motherfucker. Jesus. I can't, my ankle. God. I'm never gonna make it to the road. I better go back to the shed. I'll be found out here if I stay here for sure. Okay, okay. It's all my fault. I should've stayed put when I had the chance. Oh my ankle's killing me. Oh jeez. No! Leave me alone, I didn't do anything to you. Take one more step and I'll cut your head off. No, no, no. No, no, no, no! The car. Yes. No, no. Well, what are you waiting for? Kill me! Kill me. I thought you were dead. I don't go down that easy. Where are the others? Are you sure? Lizzie might've made it to the road. I just don't know. Some mess this is turning out to be. I found the car, let me help you, we can make it. She didn't start earlier. She floods real easily, go gentle on the gas pedal. Now let's get the hell out of here. Amen to that. It's a good thing you stumbled across the vehicle. It was hidden pretty well. We would've never seen it from the main road where we parked. Who would've known clowns can drive cars. I guess Lizzie's intuition was right. This just seems like it hasn't actually happened. This is so surreal. What do we do now? Call the police, get 'em up here to clean this mess up. This is more than just a mess, this is a nightmare. We should just be happy we're alive. Hey lady, you're in the middle of the fucking road.
