Hi, Jack. Angela. So where's the boss at? Where do you think? In the office. Right. Thanks. Hey, you coming with to Red Herring tonight? Yeah, I'll be there. Nice. I'll get dressed. ...and just make sure the transfer goes through... first thing in the morning. Go ahead and... email that confirmation to my cell. Ok. Hey! Jack! Roy. What's going on? Ah, just making a killing as usual. Have a seat. Hi, Jack. Hey, Kim. Are you here to take me on that date? Ah, not tonight, darlin'. Got business with the boss. Look, we need to talk about something... in private. Hey, do you think it's a good idea... for you guys to be drinking together? No, but I need to see him though. Hey hey hey, my man! Roy Ridell! Smooth as ever. Lookin' sharp, man! Have a seat. What the fuck is he doing here? C'mon, Damon, look. He's only here to- - I've been waiting to talk to you for five years. Yeah? Well, you know what I've been doing for five years? Waitin' to settle a score. Don't start. Yeah? Don't make me. Okay look. Knock it off. Just be the bigger man... Both of you. Hey stranger. Angela, lookin' beautiful as ever. You too, handsome. You still playin' for the right team? Care to find out? I can't. It's official - I belong to Roy now. Lucky devil. ] Hey, sweetie. Hey, Jack. ] Damon? ] Vodka. ] Cristal, please. Jack and Coke. ] White Russian. Wait here. You son of a bitch! the missing link. You bring a whole new meaning to the term... "killing off the competition. " ] What are you talking about? Wilkinson. What, did you guys break up? Why the fuck did you kill Wilkinson?! Whoa whoa whoa, guys, this is not the time, nor the place. And who the fuck are you? I'm the guy with the gun... and the right to use it. Are you threatening to shoot me? No, no, no. He's just trying to remind you... that all the swearing and threatening... in the world won't close a nine-millimeter hole. Is this what you wanted to talk to me about? You should have been a detective yourself. Now I'll be the first to admit... Wilkinson had more enemies than you. But you're the only one in town. Alright, when was he killed? Last night. Last night? Yes. Honey, where was I last night? You were on a phone call til about 10, making slow, passionate love to me til about midnight... and then experimenting with some light S&M until 2. Ooh. That's my boy. I've got the hot wax burns to prove it. Listen, Kyusovich. Aren't you tired of trying to ruin my life by now? I mean now you're trying to pin a murder rap on me? How do I know you didn't do it yourself? He was a bastard, but he was my friend. And friends don't screw each other, Roy. Ooh, imagine that, Jack. And who the fuck are you? I'm his brother. I don't have to listen to this. But you hear me now... - That is not the White Russian I ordered. What did you say, mother fucker? What did you say? Be careful, Kyusovich... that could have been you. Get up. ] Let's go. ] What the hell was that? ] Predicting the weather. ] You know, someday Damon and I... aren't going to be here to protect your dumb ass. Mouth, muscles, and morals. It's good to have the old gang back together again. That's the thing about Vegas... you never really know who you think you know. Detective Adamson? I'm Mason White, LAPD. See anything you like? I've been assigned the Wilkinson case. Why? It bears some resemblance to a couple of cases I worked... a few years ago. Hm. So you think it's a serial? It's a possibility. But, let's see what you've got first. Hey, Boss? Sorry for interrupting, but Captain wants to see you. Thanks, hon. Oh, and, she's down at City Hall. Huh, really? Hm. Adamson, I want you to work this case with White. No. No? I have to recuse myself. Conflict of interest. Sorry, Jack. This is direct from the Mayor. Begging your pardon, sir, but what business is this of yours? Oh, I understand that Mr. Ridell is considering a run for the governor's seat. If he's involved in a murder, I need to know about it. And, Detective... The fact is, it's my business... and no one else's business. Mr. Mayor, I'm best friends with the man fingers are starting to point at. You can handle it. And you can do it quickly and quietly. The press is gonna be all over us. I don't have time for this! Just show White around town. Is the forensics report in here? Yeah, 38. Nothing special about it. Wilkinson took it in the head from about 10 feet away. No fingerprints. No forced entry. It says we got the call at 3:40 yesterday afternoon. That's right. Why so long? Well, he lived alone. The maid didn't show up til around 3:30. I'm surprised none of his neighbors heard the shot. No, three heard it, but assumed it was outside. Any theories? Come on... I know you have at least one. Wilkinson had someone over for drinks. Later that evening, somebody breaks in, Wilkinson startles him. Perp takes a shot, goes for the loot. Look, this guy had enemies. Other than your friend Ridell? What do you know about Roy? Let's just say "cut-throat business sensibilities" will earn you a reputation. The police... Now what the fuck is he doing here? Observing. He can't be involved. He's friends with the killer. No suspects have been named yet. But Detective Adamson is the best investigator in Vegas, So if you want your friend's murder solved, you'll do whatever he asks you to. Okay. Come on in, gentlemens. ] What, exactly, was your relationship with the deceased, Mr. Kissavich? It's Kyusovich. Sure. Look what Detective White means is that we're more concerned in solving a crime than pronouncing names correctly. We've been worked together for about six years. What's your business? Investments. Care to elaborate? No. I don't. Okay. Then why do you think Mr. Ridell killed Mr. Wilkinson? Well, we knew Roy was involved on his trip to Russia. There were six of us on the project. Roy and his partner had developed security system for Russian M.R.I. processing company or something. And Roy had to leave under hurried circumstances. What does this have to do with Wilkinson? Let's just say... Roy wasn't named there as a suspect either. You said there were six of you. Who were the others? Chaise, Quarrie and Sukay. Do you think we might be able to contact them? I'm sure Chaise and Quarrie will want to talk to you. I'll get you their numbers. Why wouldn't Sukay want to talk to us? Go and ask Roy. Boy, I wish everyone was as cooperative as you are. Look, last night you said Wilkinson had more enemies than Ridell. Who are they? Doesn't matter. Roy did it. Ok. Are you done here? Just one more question, Mr. Kyusovich. Yes, Detective? Where were you on the night of the murder? Look if you want me to start working with you, we've got to start sharing more information. Agreed. Let's start with why you're here. Look, I'll tell you everything when we have more time. But this case is already 36 hours old and getting stale, so let's just concentrate on that. Okay. We know Roy was working with the group. They didn't get along, and he has something to hide. That presents motive. Maybe. But he also has an alibi. ] Yeah, but so does Kyusovich. I don't think he did it. I think someone else is involved. Well, why don't we go talk to Roy? Because Roy is flying to SoCal on business. He'll be back tomorrow. Okay. I'm telling you, Captain, he's not the right guy for the case. And who is? I don't know. Yes, you do. Captain, his bias is the opposite of mine, but just as strong. Listen... just keep an eye on him. Help when necessary. Stay out of the way when the fit hits the shan. You can keep your name off the paperwork. I don't want this in the news any more than you do. I'm telling you, this is a bad idea. White will bring in the shooter. You'll just happen to be along when he does. Comprende? ] Who's here? Chaise? Quarrie? Ooh! Man. Eh, it's office... Hey, so what are you doing here? Thought you could use a lift. ] Gee, thanks, but Angela's waiting outside. Nah. She had a manicure emergency... asked if I'd pick you up. Oh, really. I'm surprised she didn't ask you for a police escort to the spa. What makes you think she didn't? So what's going on? Where were you last night? What? Roy, I'm on the clock here. C'mon, man. Where were you? I was in San Diego. Do you have witnesses who can testify to that? Well, yes, of course. I was meeting with Tactara and the Isaac Org. What did you do? Well, we had dinner at 7:30. We had drinks from about 10 til 2. Hey, I've got the bar tabs to prove it. No... What did you discuss? Investments. Alright, look. I'm gonna need their numbers. Well, come on, Jack. If you call them, they're going to think I'm involved with something. ] Are you? ] Am I what? Involved with something. You haven't even asked what's happened. Ok, what's happened? Kyusovich died last night. Was he murdered? I don't know... was he? Ah. Okay, Jack, come on. You basically threaten to kill the guy, and 24 hours later he ends up dead? That automatically makes you a suspect, Roy. And you haven't even asked how he died. How'd he die? Okay, so you say it was an accident. It's within the realm of possibility, but I really don't think so. Well, then someone is setting me up. And who do you think that is? Damon. Roy. I don't know. What's going on? Kyusovich bought it. The White Russian's dead? Too bad... I really had fun playing with that guy. Look, who else would want Wilkinson and Kyusovich dead? You haven't met Chaise and Quarrie yet, have you? Chaise and Quarrie... weren't they friends of him? I mean, they wouldn't try to kill their own friends, would they? I could think of a scenario. You see... Quarrie always tried to be a better businessman than me and he always failed... So maybe he's trying to be a better thug than Kyusovich... And maybe his jealousy finally got the best of him. Then why would they set you up for it? See that's just it... they wouldn't... 'Cause they depend on me. Besides, if they were committing murder when I'm not even in town, then how can you call that a set up? Something's not right. Oop. Excuse me for a minute, gentlemen. Hey, does Angela know I'm a suspect? No. I haven't told her anything. Good. I had gotten her way too involved with those guys before. Understood. Who was that? Who? That guy you went back there to talk to. Just had to make a call. Yeah, but... Looks like lunch is on me. How was your trip? Oh, it was okay. Baby, what's wrong? Kyusovich is dead. House fire. Honey, you shouldn't feel bad. I don't. I'm glad those bastards are dead. But I am confused. I think someone's trying to set me up. Who? I haven't quite figured that out yet. ] Have you given any more thought to it? To what, baby? Oh. Leaving? Yeah. Let's just go. Let's move to the islands. We've made enough. We can start fresh. Up until this week, we've had such a great thing going here. Why would you want to walk away from that? You call paying them $10,000 a month "a great thing?" Ange, that's a small price to pay for happiness. And you and I... we're happy. Which is a lot more than I can say for most people. I don't know. I just have a bad feeling about this... Baby, if someone's pulling strings to get you, whoever it is probably won't stop until they've really gotten to you. Don't worry about me. I'll be fine. Come here. We know you killed Wilkinson and Kyusovich. No, I didn't. Roy's talking tough, but I've seen him like this before it's his way of bluffing. You will let me know when you've got something, won't you? Of course, Captain. Captain. Yeah? Thanks for putting me on this case. Don't make me regret it, Jack. But I am glad you're getting along with Jack. Don't remind me of that. Please. Come on, Damon, he was just doing his job. He didn't have to do anything. He could have "lost" some of the evidence. If he had "lost" some evidence, he'd be in a cell right next to you right now. Yeah. He is a good cop, isn't he? He's an honest cop. And you should be thankful that he got you out early. He did? Yeah. Pulled a few strings with the parole board. But he promised them that you were done with the life. Hey, a man's gotta make a living. Is Damon really Roy's brother? Yeah. Roy's parents adopted him when they were kids. I sent him up a few years ago. Shouldn't he be trying to kill you instead of them? Well, Roy and I are best friends. Been that way for years. As long as I stay that way, he won't touch me. What's his connection? ] I don't know if there is one. ] Hm. But I'm hesitant to put him into this... mix. There's got to be someone else. Hm. So, what are you thinkin? ] It's possible. Wouldn't be the first time. Alright, assuming a professional is involved, everyone's alibis would be negated. I mean for all we know, Roy could have been in Borneo and paid someone to do it. Hm. So we check some bank accounts. Exactly. Okay, here we go. Great. Alright, look I need a list of all transfers, withdrawals and purchases over, say... say, $5,000. Piece o' cake. I really appreciate this, Kimmy. ] Remember, I never did this for you. ] Same goes double for you. I was never here, okay? See? You and I are on the same wavelength. Isn't it great how well we communicate? ] Kimmy... Hey, Jack. What do you got? Alright, we've got a monthly withdrawal marked "Miscellaneous" for $10,000 a month every month for the last three years. Wow. That's pretty significant. Yeah, well, what's significant is that there are 3 new ones within the last month. The first transfer is about 2 weeks prior to Wilkinson's death. The second one's in between Wilkinson and Kyusovich. And you ready for this? The most recent was yesterday. Well, I'd say that's enough evidence to make him our prime suspect. Agreed. Agreed. Look, we need to get units on Chaise and Quarrie A.S.A.F.P. Done. Chaise called and said he had something for us. I already dispatched units on both of them - you know, thought we might get lucky. Also got a warrant to hack through Ridell's firewall. Ha ha. Yeah, good luck with that. You've got a better chance of finding Bin Laden than you do of hacking into Roy's system. Look, I'll catch up with you later. Hey, Jack. Damon, we need to talk. Hold up. Hey, Jack, I want you to meet, uh - Charlie. Hi, Charlie. ] Outside. Now. Alright. I'll be back. Don't go nowhere. Okay. Look, I did some digging. With whom? There's this guy. I don't know his name. He's a broker. Ok, look. Let me explain it. The employer finds the broker. The brokers hires the Blue Screen. The employer and the Blue Screen never ever meet. Alright, what the hell's a Blue Screen? ] He's a guy that wipes your hard drive clean, so to speak. They call him the Blue Screen of Death. That's cute. Look, what else can you tell me about him? That's it. That's all I know. ] You sure? I swear. C'mon man. Don't look at me like that. Look, I'm on your side, Jack. Thanks. Get off of me! Get down! Get down! ] Shoot him! What are you waiting for? Shoot the motherfucker! ] Get down! ] What are you waiting for? Sit down. ] Hey. Hey. You ever heard of the Blue Screen of Death? ] What, like when your PC crashes? Nah. Never mind. ] Alright. I'm on my way to Chaise's place. Yeah, I'm going to go talk to Quarrie. I'll meet you there. I'm sorry, Mr. Quarrie. Your membership was based upon Mr. Kyusovich's sponsorship. Since his membership has been revoked, you are no longer authorized to enter. Sam, it's alright. I'm inviting him in as my guest tonight. Why thank you, sir. Let me buy a drink. Much obliged. It's just not fair. I'm a respectable businessman. I deserve respect. I hear you, pal. My family deserves to live well. So do I. No foolin'! I didn't know you were a family man. That's my brat kids... God bless 'em. Hey, man, you live very well. Good lookin' family. I suppose. Thanks, sweetheart. What is it you do again? Life insurance. That's funny. Someone's trying to kill me. No... Yes! He wants to destroy everything I've worked for. He wants revenge. Why would he want to do that? You promise not to tell anyone? Scout's honor. I've been blackmailing him. What? Isn't that illegal? C'mon, what do you have on him? He murdered someone... No, wait, that was someone else. Can't the police protect you? The police. You know, if the police were to offer me protre... protection, I wouldn't take it. I wouldn't want to subject my family to that. I don't want them live in fear. Besides, if this guy can get to Kyusovich, he can get to me. C'mon, buddy. How bout I take you home, huh? Relax, Rookie. We're just gonna hang back until Adamson gets here. So, what's the news, guys? All's quiet. Oh, c'mon! Stop! This is the police! We'll shoot! ] Come on! Don't give us an excuse, asshole. This guy ain't giving us any excuses at all. Yeah, well, I... I wasn't... I never even shot... Don't worry about it. ] Look, we both saw what happened... Everything was by the book. ] Just fired. Yeah. What the hell was that? What was what? Let's go! You stay here! Call it in! ] Stop the car! Let me see your hands! Hands! Let me see em! Hands Up! Let me see em! I hate my job. ] Sorry. So this is where you come to unwind, huh? Yeah. Nice. You know we did volunteer for this. Yeah. And we can quit at any time. Yeah. But there's no one else to do it. Yeah. Look, Jack, about why I'm here... I started a file on Ridell about four years ago. Two C.E.O.'s he was competing against met with, shall we say... "untimely deaths. " So what makes you think Roy was involved? Those 2 deaths cleared the way for Ridell's early success. I can't believe he didn't tell me about this. We had to close the case for political reasons. Really. I've been watching Ridell and his associates, just waiting for them to come back up on the radar. Why don't you email me them case files. I'll look over 'em, see what I can get out of Roy. Roy and I owe each other our lives, but that doesn't put him above the law. Wow. Why are you so hell-bent on getting Roy? He's the one that got away with it. I always know when they're guilty, and I hate to see a guilty man walk free. Well, if fate isn't tickling my tatas tonight! So you gonna say I can't buy you that drink now? Have a seat. I don't eat dark Chocolate. ] Why? It's rich and goes down so easy. ] Entertain the ladies for a moment. ] It's gonna take longer than a moment. You know the rules, Saffiote. Hey, Jack, we make the rules. Yeah, well, you're not supposed to contact me here, Even if it's a matter of life and death. With you it's always a matter of life and death. We came by to, uh, congratulate you on such a great job you did tonight. What?! A rookie cop kills an innocent man? That kid has to live with that for the rest of his life. Well it wasn't my idea... Jack-off. You son of a... Whoa, Jack. Take it easy. Get your hand off me. I don't want to see you guys here again. Yeah? Well, do what we tell you next time. This is a bad idea. ] It's more complicated than it looks. ] Oops. I don't know what to say. ] The first thing that comes to mind. I don't know if you're a stalker I should be worried about, or a devoted lover I should admire. ] I'm neither. C'mon. Have a seat. So what's the chances these three deaths are one big coincidence? Okay, not a coincidence. Let's go over the events of last night. "Blue Screen" figures on us putting units on these guys, so he knows he has to get one or both of them immediately. There's a what? There's a guy killing people. I'm supposed to tell you about fuckin' killin'? ] I'm asking you if you've heard anything about it. ] When did you ever help me out? When? Tell me one fuckin' time you ever helped me out. You know what? Get the fuck outta here! See you later! All set. Here we go. Anything I should know about? No. They're not helping. They've never heard of Blue Screen? ] Adamson... Make me happy... You're the man, Jimmy. Thanks. All three match? I knew you'd make a good detective some day. So you going to tell me what you were thinking earlier? Maybe Chaise deleted Wilkinson and Kyusovich. That would explain why there was no forced entry in Wilkinson's apartment. Wilkinson actually invited Chaise in. I certainly hope that's the case. What we don't need is an assassin running around Vegas making a name for himself. Let's say Blue Screen is real. If we catch him, we could discourage any other copycat killers. Alright, look. Let's keep working on the assumption that there is a Blue Screen, and he is involved. So what's our next move? Find the broker. Obriga. Obriga. So this is your infamous buddy? Damon, this is Detective White. White, Damon Ridell. Nice to meet you, convict. Take it easy, White. Way I hear it, you're a cold-blooded pusher looking for a reason to get back in the joint. What have you been telling him? Nothing! White, take a walk! Meet me back here in 10. Look, I need you to talk to me. Tell you what. You get in the cage with me for one round, I'll tell you everything you need to know. You're kidding Time's tickin'. Talk! ] What? Tap. ] Talk! ] Tap! ] Talk! Stubborn bastard. Wow. Hello. Hi. So what the Hell are you getting yourself into? Look, you have got to start trusting me, Jack. Damon, I can't trust you if you keep me in the dark. I'm doing this for Roy, ok? You're gonna go back to jail for him? No. But I owe him big time. By being a murder broker? ] That's a pretty serious accusation. It's not an accusation. It's just a suspicion. I haven't even told my partner yet. And what a pleasant individual he is. I got a line on a broker, alright? I can't confirm he's involved in this. If you want to check it out yourself, that's your business. But he goes by the alias "El Corredor. " He owns a rattlesnake restaurant down in Tijuana. You should be able to take it from there. Okay. Thanks, Damon. Good fight. Oops, sorry. ] It's alright. ] Hey. You okay? ] Yeah. ] Whatchu got? Feel like going to Mexico? Real classy guy. ] Yeah, I bet your sister'd like him. You know my sister? 'Cause she probably would like him. You ready? Ready for what? Oh, come on. We can't just waltz in there and tell this guy we're investigating him for a crime in another country for which we have no witnesses or no evidence. That makes sense. Let's just hang back. We'll check things out later. Bienvenido, mi amigo. Como estas? You know this guy? Same as before. I already took my 20%. Look, the employer is very happy with your work. And you've impressed me. What? I think that may be our guy. Why? Doesn't he look a little out of place here? So what are we waiting for? I mean, why don't we go after him? Nah, I got his plate when he came in. We'll put him through the system when we get back. Look, your hunches have been pretty accurate so far. ] Why don't we have an unmarked pick him up at San Ysidro? Then someone in the department's gonna know we've been down here beyond our jurisdiction. Come on, I thought you were supposed to be a detective. ] Alright, you ready? Yeah, let's do this. ] Shh. Alright. You know, for a detective renowned for playing by the rules, you sure break a lot of them. ] Look, it's all about image and perception. As long as you follow the rules while everyone's looking, get the results everybody wants, you can tweak the laws here and there. ] True that. ] Plus, the best thing is... the Federales are easy to bribe. ] How would you know that? ] Hey, I could have a dark and mysterious past. No, you couldn't. Yeah, you're right. I couldn't. ] Alright. ] I thought this guy was supposed to have money. That's what they say. ] Did you bring a bug? ] If we leave behind evidence we were here, then we're gonna get thrown off the case and demoted. Can you crack that thing? Not quickly enough. ] Jack. I'm not seeing anything else here. Yeah. You ready to blow this pop stand? ] Wait a second. What? What's that? ] Looks like a wax seal. ] Let's take it with us. Alright. ] Alright. ] You ready to get back to the good ol' U.S. of A.? ] Yeah. Let's go. Adamson... Thanks, Jimmy. What? Standard candle wax. You can buy it in any arts and crafts store. ] Wasted night. Yep. I need you to tell me about these guys, Roy. What do you want to know? They're dead. Tell me about your relationship with them. I'm not involved. So our relationship isn't relevant. No, it is. The evidence is starting to mount against you. Evidence? What evidence? Don't get defensive. Well, Jack, you're accusing me of murder, so I'm gonna get a little defensive. Roy, I'm here as a friend. Are you? Did you see Wilkinson the night he was killed? Ok, if I was there, and I did, you know we have business together. I can't believe you lied to me. Alright, let's take a walk. Okay, so what did Kyusovich tell you? Don't worry about that, Roy. Tell me your story. Okay. It started about four years ago. We were working on this really intricate way of ] Whoa... "We?" ] manufacturing... Yeah. Sukay and me. But because the market started to downturn, I couldn't raise the necessary capital through legitimate channels. And then, I met Kyusovich. And he was able to raise the funds through... other ways. They agreed to let us keep the domestic profits, But they were insistent on retaining complete rights over the international revenue. Ah, well, then they sent us off to Moscow to adapt our process for a Russian radiology network. Okay, go on. I managed to escape and flee the country. Why didn't you just go to the local police? Well, because during the attack, one of them kept saying "Kyusovich. " So with the Russian mob there, I just figured that the local cops were in their back pocket. Alright, well what happened when you got back to the States? So in order to get even with them for killing Sukay, I modified the code so that it would only work on U.S. networks. I got rich, and Kyusovich and company lost their investment. And they just let this go? Hell no. Because I escaped, I was a witness to their murder. And Kyosovich threatened to tell the Russian mob where I was unless I paid him hush money. So that's where the $10,000 a month comes from. How did you know that? Roy, I'm a Detective. You know it's my job to find that out. And that's exactly what you told Damon before you Mirandized him. Whoa, take it easy. Roy, I hate what I do. You know that. Then why do you do it? Because I have to. I have no choice. Angela wants out. Out? Out of what? Everything. Sell the house, the cars, the businesses. Run off to the islands, Costa Rica, wherever. Are you considering it? Yes! I don't know. But hypothetically if we go, would you come with us? I mean, Roy, that'd be great, but... Jack, it'll be just like old times. Roy, I can't. Look, I can't leave Vegas. Jack. She's not coming back. You don't have to wait... I know. Let me buy you lunch. ] Hi. Something to drink? Yeah I'll just have a water. ] Iced tea is great. Thank you. ] Iced Tea. No problem. So are you going to let me take a look at your phone bills? Why? What are you looking for? It depends. What are you hiding? I gotta hit the john. Yeah, good luck. Talk to him about Los Angeles, Jack. ] Thank you. Hey, so why don't you tell me about L.A. What do you mean? Listen, Jack, the fortunes of some are often precipitated by the misfortunes of others. It happens all the time, and you can't expect me to feel bad about that. Yeah, well, you know what? We've been friends for 25 years, Roy. 25 years. I want to know why you didn't tell me about any of this. Because, Jack. You're such a freakin honest cop, and I didn't want you treating me like every other suspect. And I didn't want you digging and finding connections that weren't there. Listen - Roy... I just didn't want you judging me, alright? I just... just didn't want us to lose what we had. You have to admit, it's kinda funny how people tend to die when they disagree with you. Thank you... for perfectly proving my point. Christ, Jack. Who are you? Jesus. Yeah. Hey, Jack. Just wanted to let you know your partner and the other officers are at Roy's right now. Okay. You get the warrant and I'll bring him in. Alright. Leave an unmarked there. Copy. Shit. Roy! Look, we just raided your house. You did what? Look, we found evidence. They're getting an arrest warrant. You're fucking unbelievable. I'm sorry. But now's your chance, okay? Don't go home. Turn your cell phone off, get out of town, and don't tell anyone except Angela where you're going. Yeah, now I can see why she left. No, you... I'll do what I can. Yeah? And you'll always put your work before your friends, Jack. That's not fair! What are the chances your Sicilian friends are involved in this? There isn't. How can you be so sure? I'm sure. Anything? Still nothing. The woman came by about 15 minutes ago. She only went in for about 5 minutes, then drove off. Well, did anybody follow her? Copy. So where do we look next? Mr. Ridell. Detective White. Nice to see you're still carrying the old torch for me. And thank you, friend, for telling me that you're working with him. Roy... I don't know where you're going with this investigation, but I am not a criminal. I'm a respectable businessman, and as such I am willing to cooperate with you gentlemen in any way I can. Tell me what evidence it is that you think you have against me, and I'll try to explain it. Thank you. I appreciate that, but you have the right to remain silent. I know, but silence won't help me now. We recorded a conversation between you, Quarrie and Chaise. I believe you said "Let's say I don't kill you. How much is that worth?" And that sounds like premeditation to me, which amounts to Murder 1. I simply said what I needed to to get them out of my house. And let us not forget, Detective White, that it was your boy that killed Chaise. Well, can you explain the cash? What cash? He doesn't know about the money. Angie, what are you talking about? I've lent Damon some money to find his feet. I've made a few withdrawals. How much? 50 grand. Oh, Goddamnit. He's gonna pay us back. I know. That's not the point. I transferred ten grand to him as well. Why? Legal fees. So what, he's playing both of us for money? Why would Damon want to set you up? He wouldn't. It Judy doesn't make any sense. Roy, I don't know what Damon has planned. Alright, the safest place for you and Angela is right here. Well, you'll forgive me, Detective Adamson, if I don't feel safe staying in such a public place. I think it might be better if no one knew where we were. Look, you may be fooling him, but I'm gonna get you this time, motherfucker. Bring it. Tell me about Damon's jail time. Well, not much to tell. He did five years... model prisoner. I called in a few favors. Got him out early. It was all above the table. Did you ever see him in jail? No, whenever I went there, he refused to see me. And you say he got out on Wednesday, right? Yeah. What's this about? Look, I did some digging and found some video, recorded at Henderson Executive Airport, on Monday. Watch this. Now that plane had no markings and no flight plan with the FAA. And he was the only one who disembarked. Wait, this doesn't make any sense. Now the prison records indicate that he did his time and was released on Wednesday, but I checked with his neighbors on his cell block, and none of them had ever seen or heard of him. You telling me he didn't do any jail time? Looks that way. You join the stakeout at Roy's motel. I'll find Damon... see if he'll come in voluntarily. Now you're talking. Now, keep an eye on the perimeter. Make sure that nobody comes up behind us. Alright? Good job, Officer. Adamson. Guess whose just pulled into the motel. Surprise me. Mr. Quarrie. At the same motel? Uh huh. And he just checked into the room right next to our old friend Mr. Ridell. Huh. You mean to tell me that something's actually going to be convenient for us? I'm here to tell you. Okay. As soon as I'm done with dinner, I'll head over. Okay. See you soon. No. You have certain obligations to us. Don't remind me. It's our job to remind you. Why don't you do me a favor for once, Saffiote? You want me to do you a favor? Yeah. What is it, Jack? ] Tell me about the Russian mob. The Russian mob? A bunch of undisciplined drunks. ] So you know them. Yeah, I know them. We had a few dealings with 'em. Dug a few holes. Sent 'em a message. We didn't want to get you involved. You didn't want them to encroach on your territory? Whoa. You said it, not us. You don't look too happy. Should I be? Look, would you hear about it if they were trying to make another move here? Maybe try to tie up some loose ends? Probably... but I don't think I'd tell you. Okay. Where you going, Jack? What's it to you? Well we have somebody coming to dinner to join us. Excuse me? You know... Kim. We've seen you together, Jack. You guys make a good couple... Why don't you give her a shot? C'mon, you've been alone too long. Look at this kid over here. Hey. How's it going? Good. Just brainstorming here... let's say the Russian mob was trying to make another play for Vegas, they'd want to make a name for themselves, right? Absolutely. Well what better way to do that than to set a few examples before they come? Yeah, but would they kill their own man? Who? Kyusovich? C'mon. He wasn't the most pleasant guy we ever met. No, but wouldn't they want him around for, like, introductions around town? I'm still working on that one. Anyways, what's going on here? Where they at? Ridell is in 6. Quarrie 7. I'm gonna go talk to Roy. You want me to go with you? No, you hang back here. Keep an eye on things. Call me if anyone comes. ] You got it. Baby, it's not worth it. Yeah, it was paradise when we first moved here, but we need to move on. No, we don't need to move on. I've put in too much time and worked too hard to build what we have here. I just want this whole mess to blow over, so that we can go back to the way it was. Who is it? It's Jack. ] Are you alone? White's in the car outside. It's the Russians. ] What? ] What haven't you told me? I told you everything. ]Tell me about the Russians! Alright. Start talking. Alright. Alright, the money that Kyusovich and the others invested in the company was Russian mob money. And? So Kyusovich thought he could regain control of all the domestic profits by killing Sukay and me. But obviously that backfired. We met this guy in Mexico named El Corredor. Yeah I know him. Of course you do. Well then I heard that the Russians were mad at Kyusovich for losing their money, So I thought if they killed him, they could get away with it. And then in turn, that would get me off the hook with all the blackmail payments. So I made a call to the Russians, gave them some convincing evidence that Kyusovich lost their money gambling. And then, I told them where they could find El Corredor. Roy... So you are - indirectly - responsible. Jack I may have given them the weapon, but I didn't pull the trigger. People have been convicted for less! Nothing ever happened, so I assumed that they let it go. But you did set this whole thing in motion? Look, Jack, they tried to screw me, so I screwed them right back. But I didn't kill anybody. Okay! You're right. Pulling the trigger is what counts. But we may still have to charge you with Solicitation or even Accessory. Don't worry... I'm sure a good lawyer could get you out of it. If it was the Russians. Right. Well, we need to warn Quarrie. That's easy. He's right next door. You've gotta be joking. ] You guys stay here. Mr. Quarrie? Mr. Quarrie, it's the Police! Open up! Please forgive me. They were my friends. I don't know why I did it. I just can't live with it any more. What? What is it? ] The Russians aren't coming. So Quarrie had Chaise kill his other two friends so they could get all the blackmail money. He felt guilty and killed himself. Yes. So after all this, you didn't save any lives or bring in any collars. No, ma'am. Great. Nice work. Sorry we let you down, Captain. Good thing we're not paying you commission. With your permission, I'd like to keep the case open... see if there really is a Blue Screen. But I need permission to wiretap El Corredor's office. You know I can't authorize that. Do your digging on your turf. You two can go now. Thank you, ma'am. I'll catch up with you in a minute. Okay. So what's on your mind, Jack? It's Detective White, ma'am. You're going to tell me how you hate working with a partner and No, no, no, he's a fine partner. What's the problem, then? He may be the Blue Screen. That's a pretty serious accusation. Look, I know it's a stretch, but all the pieces fit. We don't know who the hell authorized his transfer from L.A., but it did all happen before Wilkinson. It did? It's the only way the timing would have worked. And he's the one who proposed that a professional was involved in the first place. Okay. Go on. I didn't see him when the others were killed. There are a million people in the city you didn't see when the murders took place. Jack, I can't have you accuse a decorated officer... with connections... of murder based on circumstantial evidence. See if you can find something solid, but otherwise don't mention this to anyone. Okay. Don't mention this. Ever. I heard you. ] What are you doing? We just got a new case. No, we're keeping the Blue Screen open. We have all these notes in the file, Jack. Yeah, well that board helps me think. Okay. You're still hung up on Quarrie. I mean, what's up? It just doesn't sit well. Quarrie copped to it in his note. It's over, Jack. What more do you want? Funny you're supposed to be this great cop that doesn't let anyone get away. Jack, it's not the biggest case of my life. Let me ask you something, Mason. How'd you find out about Wilkinson so quickly? I told you, Jack. I had Ridell and his associates put on a watch list. I'm down here for Ridell. And frankly, I don't want to spend another minute on this case unless we can tie it to Ridell. Don't make this a vendetta. Listen, you're the only one who wants to prove the Blue Screen exists. If you weren't so hell-bent on making a name for yourself... Oh, please. Not everyone's motivated by fame and fortune, Mason. What do you want to do here, Jack? I want to catch the Blue Screen! There is no Blue Screen! He doesn't exist! Quarrie ordered it; Chaise did it. End of story. So if that letter were true, then why would they try to force Roy to leave town? They'd be throwing money away. Furthermore, if he really wanted to kill himself, why would he pack his bags and go to a motel? Maybe he was confused. No, he was afraid of someone, and he ran. What are you thinking? Why did Damon need all that extra money from Roy and Angela? Maybe he was just trying to scam both of them. I mean he is a convict after all. I think it's time to put the fear of God into him. Okay, great. Alright, let's go. No. You stay here. Check in with I.T. on those account numbers. I'll take care of Damon. Okay. But if we don't come up with a Blue Screen, say, by the end of the week, we move on to a new case. Agreed? Jack? So you say you didn't know that much about El Corredor, huh? Looks to me like you two have been buddies for quite some time. Yeah. You're right. We served together for two years. Yeah, well, why don't you tell me about some of the other guys on your cell block. What? Tell me about Ramirez. Tell me about Jones. There's nothing to tell. Ramirez is a gang-banger. Three-striker. Jones was falsely convicted. He shouldn't even be there, but he won't be there long. There was no one on your cell block named Ramirez or Jones, dumbass. I know you didn't serve any time with El Corredor, 'cause you didn't serve any time. Why don't you just cut the shit and just tell me the truth, Damon? I can't. You know better than anybody else that some things should never be spoken. You knew we were gonna find out about it anyway. Only if you play by the rules, Jack. Jesus Christ, can't you just see I'm trying to do my job here?! What the hell did you do with all the extra money from Roy and Angela? Legal fees. After my legal fees, I only had enough left over to get a car. You blew $60,000? 10, Jack. Only 10. Kim! Kim? Kim. Who's Kim? Roy's secretary. Angela thinks she transferred you 50,000. Roy thinks he transferred you 10. You only got 10, right? Why would she do that? Maybe to protect Roy. She probably got in contact with El Corredor through the Sicilians. ] What are we waiting for? ] Right... ] Roy, you don't think... Yeah, I do think. He's my brother, but I wouldn't put it past him. He's got the money and the motive. You know you're starting to sound like Jack. ] What do you hope to find down here, baby? I don't know. Answers. Why don't you just go inside and talk to him? Okay. What? Wait, Roy, I wasn't being serious. What, are y'all here to join me for dinner? ] We gotta talk. You boys obviously have some things to sort out. I'll be in the se?orita's room. Why are you here? Why are you following me? What are you doing down here? You know you're not supposed to be here. Jesus. Where's the ba?o? It's around the corner, to your right. ] I've thoroughly enjoyed the rattlesnake. Although this is probably the last time I'm going to eat it. I'd like everything finished within the next 24 hours. Sure, I understand. Thank you for your loyal patronage. So what did I miss? Hey, babe, I think you're right. I think it's time for us to leave Vegas. What? Oh, baby, I'm so glad. Let's just leave now. Thank you for being a pal. No problem. See you at the Herring. ] So what did Damon say? What the Hell were you thinking? Baby, what's wrong? Be straight with me! For once in your life be honest! How could you do it? Honey, I did it for you. Those guys were not gonna stop... not while they were still alive. But they got the message. They got the message after Wilkinson and after Kyusovich. But, Ange, why did you have to kill Chaise and Quarrie? They had families! Let's just move past this, okay? They're not in our lives any more. They can't get to you. It's just you and me now. How much were they? What's a human life go for these days? 10,000 each. Then why was it 50, not 40? I had to pay for one more job to get some things cleaned up. You're going to have him kill Jack!? What? No! God! Just trust me... you don't want to know who the last target is. Baby, let's just go. Let's sell the house. Let's get out of here. I don't know. I feel like I don't even know you. I love you, Roy. I love you. Can't you see that? I am going to need some time with all this. Okay. Okay, I understand. How about two weeks? And if I'm not ready by then, what, are you going to have me whacked? Come on, baby. Who's my howling monkey? So. What was Damon's connection was to this whole thing? He told me how to find El Corredor. Are you satisfied now? Yeah. Pinche, gringo. You're developing quite a reputation. Do you like the "mi arte de la semana?" You gonna sit down? Or is this an official work visit? Give me something. Okay.

You know this guy? You know the first animal I ever killed was a squirrel. I accidentally ran over it with my parents' minivan. I really did try to avoid it. When I felt it go under the tires, I slammed on the breaks. I looked out the rear view mirror and saw him twitching and jerking. Much like you are right now. I stepped out with a gas can, ready to put it out of its misery. But as I got closer, ooh, I was fascinated. This creature was trying to keep its soul from being ripped from its body. There was so much emotion going through this thing because it knew that it would never live again. All it wanted was just one more day, just one minute, to enjoy its life on this Earth. And you know what it could think about? That it's one life was about to end. What are you thinking about? Well, after that, I swore to God that I would never kill anything again. But every day that went by, ooh, that hunger grew... The hunger to see that struggle to live. You see I don't like what I have to do... but I am fascinated by it. Lo siento, mi amigo. ] Well, well, well, Jack! Nice of you to join us. Nice to see your work ethic still supersedes your punctuality. Sorry I'm late. So, we're toasting to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. ] You mean "Property. " ] What? Well, the phrase in the Bill of Rights actually reads "nor... shall any person be deprived of life, liberty, or property. " What? Always by the book, Jack, huh? Always. It's nice to see the old gang together again. It's nice to see the old gang together again.
