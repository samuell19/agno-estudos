Suspect is wanted in connection with the murder of a police officer. He should be considered armed and dangerous. I'm not coming out, you hear me? I'm not coming out. I want everyone gone. You, your men, snipers, everyone. If I don't see taillights in the next five minutes, you're not gonna like what happens next. Ray? Can you get him back on the phone? He's done talking. Do it. Yes, sir. Gold Unit, this is HR1. Move to green. Ma'am, come with me. FBI, show me your hands! Hands! Turn around! Shit. Got him clean, boss. Ben. No. He's not carrying. Ray. Ray, look at me. It's all over. I didn't want it to end like this. It's not supposed to end like this. Put your son down and step away. I'm sorry. It's ok. Good. No! Command, this is Navy Alpha twooneniner en route to Beaufort Naval Hospital. I need more saline over here! Dr. McCullen, Surgery, please. Three, two, one, lift. He's ready for you, Lieutenant. You're gonna be ok. From the Great Pyramid of Giza to the Tower of Babel, brick by brick and stone by stone, mankind has been consumed by one singular desire, to touch the sky. Perhaps, finally, we've done it. The brainchild of former tech magnate, Zhao Long Ji. Zhao Long Ji. Zhao Long Ji. Visionary entrepreneur Zhao Long Ji... Who has spared no expense creating this city in the sky, going so far as to build a 30 story vertical park at the building's center. The Pearl speaks to what we can achieve when we don't accept limitations. This isn't just another building. Tallest building on Earth. This hightech highrise generates all of its energy needs from a massive double helix wind turbine near its top. Dwarfing the Burj Khalifa and tripling the height of the venerable Empire State Building. Over 3,000 feet. The Pearl. The Pearl's lower half has delighted the public for six months. Its residential upper half has yet to open its doors. Buildings shape our society. Better buildings... Better cities. A better world. But it's the mysterious sphere that has the world buzzing. In a statement released today, the secretive billionaire confirmed that despite rumors of an inability to fully insure a structure this size, plans to open the building's upper half remain on track. He promises that the sphere will be the number one tourist attraction in the world, with views of Hong Kong... The screens go off, shoes go on. It's panda time. Where's your dad? I need him to fix my phone before we go. Bathroom. Ok. He's talking to himself again. Screw it. I'm just gonna highfive the guy. You ok? Yeah. Yeah, just some leg stuff, you know. Well, you look very handsome. You think so? Does it look like I'm trying too hard? No, it looks respectful. Maybe I lose the tie? No, but you should learn to tie one. Come here. I can hear your gears turning. What's going on? I just don't want to screw it up, you know. You're not gonna screw it up. I don't know. What if I missed something? Baby, there's no way you've missed something. You've been preparing for this meeting for six months. I've never seen you work harder on anything. You're ready for this. You know this place better than the architect. You're gonna do great. They flew you out here for a reason. They want to hear what you have to say. Yeah, hope so. Ben stuck his neck out for me and then, this could be a real game changer for us. They give stuff like this to big companies. I work out of our garage. Yeah, it's a good garage. Ok, look, just because you're a smaller company does not mean that you don't belong and, for the record, Ben stuck his neck out for you because he's your friend and that's what friends do. Hey. Look at me. Look at me. You've got this. I love you. You better. Come here. My phone isn't working. So was all the... Hey, look at me, you've got this, you look so handsome, just a way of buttering me up to fix your phone again? It's a distinct possibility. Ok. All right what do I tell you to do any time something's wrong with your phone? Try turning it off and on again. Try turning it off and on again. 90% of the time, you can fix a problem by turning it off and on again. So, did you, try turning it off and on again? Nope. I like it better when you do it. It gives you a sense of accomplishment. I see. So you're asking me to fix your phone for me? You're welcome. Put your coats in your bags. All right, kids. You guys are gonna go see pandas. Pandas. Daddy's gonna go make that bacon. Let me ask you a question. Daddy loves who? Me. Daddy loves who? Me! Me! Me! Me! Can't hear you. Can't hear you. Me! Me! Confidence. Not confident. Me! Me! Daddy loves who? Me! Me! Ok, ok, you know what? You're both right. Because, Daddy loves you both. I got to get a chant. You fixed it? As always. You really do love me. Kind of. Come here. Gross. Floor 98. My brother. Brother. Get in here. Jesus Christ. Sarah, you look beautiful. Thank you. It's so good to see you. Come on. Right? You're kidding me. These are the twins? I know. They're so big now. What are you guys up to? We're going to see the pandas. I heard. This'll get you in to see the nighttime panda feeding. After everybody's left. Very hard to come by. Thank you. But I know a lot of pandas, so. There you go. Some gear, just to look the part. What do you guys say? Thank you. Get out of here, go have fun. I'll see you tonight, honey. Good luck. Love you. See you guys. Bye. Bye. What's up? Good to see you. Hey, look. Thanks for putting in a good word. I know my company's small for something this size. Come on. It's nothing. Just doing my job. They're dying to open the upper half. And they needed somebody to check the math on their safety and security systems. Plus, you were cheaper than anyone else. A lot cheaper. Like half. Floor 220. So subtle? Yep. Solid titanium. Nothing says, welcome to my penthouse panic room, like 10 inches of militarygrade super alloy. Ready to meet Oz? Well, I think so. I mean, I guess if you got to live somewhere... Right? Mr. Sawyer. It's a pleasure to finally meet you. You know, I... I'm kidding. Thank God. My wife only taught me one phrase. Sarah, right? She's a Naval surgeon, isn't she? She is. She also minored in language and East Asian studies at Annapolis. And your twins, Henry and Georgia. You know your stuff. You are the very first family we have had in the residential section of The Pearl. I thought it might be a good test for us. Well, they absolutely love it. It's their first visit to Hong Kong. Here they are. Allow me to introduce my head of personal security, Ajani Okeke, and Mr. Pierce from the HawthorneStone Insurance Group. A pleasure. Very nice to meet you Mr. Sawyer. Likewise. After your independent thir dparty assessment is approved, they will confirm full coverage of The Pearl, which I'm told will carry the most expensive premium for a single structure in underwriting history. So... Shall we begin? Can't wait. The Pearl's antifire measures employ a one of a kind self sealing ventilation system and a robust sprinkler and CO2 array which can put out a fire in a fraction of the time. All monitored by a control facility located over a mile away. You hired me to assess your safety and security systems and after a complete analysis, I can say that it's the safest supertall structure in the world. It's Fort Knox, a mile in the sky. Once I inspect the security at the offsite facility, my job will be done, and you can open the residential upper half. Thank you. You were the right man for the job. Just like Ben said. This tablet will give you administrative access to The Pearl's fire and safety control measures. Once linked to your biometric data, you'll be the only one who can access it. Ben will take you to our offsite facility so you can make sure everything checks out. Thank you. If we hurry, there's still time. Time for what? For you to see it. Go. Yeah. This is the real pearl. Three hundred and seventeen motionsensitive projection panels make this sphere the eighth wonder of the world. It's incredible. I'm over there. In here, anything is possible. The sphere is comprised of nearly 25,000 ultra highdefinition panels with embedded 8K microcameras on both sides. Both sides? Why is that? Welcome to heaven, Mr. Sawyer. God. Welcome to heaven? He really said that? Yeah. But, like, cool or creepy? Little of both. God, rich guys. You work for them, though. You ever miss it? The team? Yeah, sure. Yeah, but things are a lot different now. I got... I got a wife and kids, and I haven't touched a gun in 10 years. You're kidding. No. What's that about? Well, after what happened... I just... kind of put my sword down, you know? I laid it down and... I'm just never gonna pick it up again. Come on. He was unarmed. You know, he was wearing a vest. There's no way you could've known that. Just bad luck, that's all. Maybe. You know, the funny thing is, without that bad luck, I... I never would've met Sarah. I never would've had my kids. I don't know who I'd be without my family. I'd be... I'd be lost and... I'd be... Me. Come on, man, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like that. Come on. Relax. I'm kidding. We're here. Come on. The kids are really excited about the nighttime feeding. Yeah, it's a blast. They'll be there all night. Thanks for taking me to the offsite. No worries. I mean, dinner's on you, of course. Hey. He's got my bag! You all right? Yeah. Oh man. It's nasty. Yeah. Better get that cleaned up? Well, this feels familiar. Yeah. You're gonna need some stitches for that, though, man. That's a nasty cut, bro. I'm gonna call Sarah. Yeah. Is that Zhao's tablet? Yeah, I put it in my jacket before we left. How's that for luck? Yeah, man. Nice one. Thought we were both gonna get fired for that. Hey. How are the pandas? Floor 98. Well, we didn't really get to see them because Henry ate a weird candy and started throwing up, so we came back. Is he ok? Did he have an attack? No, he's breathing fine. Just, you know, no pandas, which sucks. It sucks. Don't say sucks, honey. I'll take you there tomorrow ok, if you're feeling better. I'll see you soon. Ok. Bye. Sorry, miss. Building maintenance. We thought this floor was empty. Yeah me too. Everything ok? Everything's fine. We're just checking the phone lines. I didn't know they were active yet. Well, they will be when we finish with them. Well, look at this precious little pair. Are you having fun? You got the run of the castle on this floor. Not too bad, for a big strong knight... and a beautiful little princess. I'm a king. A thousand apologies, Your Majesty. Come on, guys. They were supposed to be gone. I know. Want me to clean that up? No. Leave it. It'll take care of itself. What's up? Where you going? I got to go. Henry's not feeling well. They went back to The Pearl. They went back to The Pearl? Yeah. All right. I'll call you tonight. What a day? You're not gonna make it in time. What? Why'd you take it out of the bag? You should've just left it in the bag. Ben, what are you talking about? Give me the tablet, Will. What's going on? What's going on? You screw up. You get a whole new life. What do I get? Medical discharge? Working for thugs? You don't know these people, Will. I don't have a choice, Because you messed it up. I know you're hurting, brother, but you don't want to do this. We're not brothers. Ben. Stop! Stop! Stop! Come here. Here, stay with me. Let's get you up. Come on, let's go. Sit up. There we go. Let's get you over here. Ok, here, stay with me. Hold this here. Hold it tight. I need you to tell me what happened, ok? All right? I can help you, if you tell me what happened. They weren't supposed to go back, Will. They weren't supposed to be there. Who wasn't supposed to be there? Sarah and the kids. What did you do? Light a man's house on fire, and you find out what he truly loves. Shelter in place. Mom? What's going on? Antifire measures activated. I don't know. Let me go check. Shelter in place. Antifire measures activated. Stay on the couch. Should we evacuate? Evacuate? Yes, take a helicopter. Why would we do that? Well, the building's on fire. The building isn't on fire. The 96th floor is on fire. We're more than a hundred stories above that, and the antifire measures will keep it there. We're perfectly safe here, I assure you. What did you do? I set you up. They need the tablet. Run. They're coming, Will. They're gonna kill you. Who's coming? Who? Run. Ben? Ben? Shit! Hello, Will. Thank you. Go! Antifire measures activated. Ok, guys, in the bathroom. Shelter in place. Come on. Antifire measures activated. Come here, bud. I'm fine, Mom. I don't need it. You're fine now, honey, but we're about to go out there, and there's a lot of smoke and a lot of bad air, and we don't want you to have an attack, ok? Georgia, dunk them all the way. Make sure they get completely wet, the hand towels, too. Ok. Two quick inhales, please. Mom? Are we gonna die? Antifire measures activated. No. Baby, we are not gonna die. We are gonna be just fine. I promise. We're in position at the offsite control facility. Do it. There you are. Baby, there's a fire in the building. I know. All right look, I can't get to you. The police have the entire building locked down. I want you to get out of there right now. Go inside the hallway there should be a logistics panel. If you show it to me, I can tell you where it's safe to go. Take the kids with you. I'm gonna stay on the phone. Ok. Hand me those towels. Come on. Occupancy warning on floor 98. Will Sawyer's family unlocked their apartment door an hour ago. They're in the building. Send two men. Use the manual override code on the elevators. Bring them here. Yes, sir. You two, go. What? Listen, the fire isn't just gonna go out. We need to leave now. Security alert. I can only access nominal control. I can't lock out the onsite functions without the... Root access. Ok. We're in. The entire system has been compromised. I'm completely locked out. What do you mean you're locked out? I thought that couldn't happen. We have full control of the antifire systems. Seal all the fire doors from 95 to the ground. And disable all antifire measures from 96 to the top. Everything's gonna be ok. The logistics panel should be to your left. Tell me what you see. Ok, hon. All the floors above us are yellow. What does that mean? It means the entire fire system above you is offline. Sarah, listen to me. The fire is not gonna stop. I want you to get out of there right now and go up. Go up, keep going up, don't stop, don't look back. Now force the fire up. Open the elevator shaft air vents and feed it with fresh oxygen. Let it burn. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you a $6.5 billion chimney. Mrs. Sawyer? We're with the building security. Come with us, please. No! Get back! Run! No! No! What is your status? Report. Do you copy? No one could survive that. They're gone. We're moving into position. You know what to do next. Go hurry up the stairs. Sarah. Will Sawyer... Please. You don't understand. My family's inside. Listen to me. I have to get to them. So, you have full systems control from the tablet and there's no facial recognition needed. All other access points to The Pearl mainframe have been encrypted. The entire building now, it's locked out. I used my own logarithmic base cipher to encrypt it, so I am literally the only human, on the planet Earth that can crack this. Yeah, it's pretty smart, right? Not that smart. If the fire continues to climb, it will superheat the air around the helipad, making liftoff impossible. Our departure window is closing, sir. I hate to say it, but it is now or never. Warning. Antifire measures offline. Happy? You got to play the hero, it didn't work, it's time to go. All right, Mr. Pierce. You'll get your wish. Get the helo ready. Prep the bird. Yes, sir. Sir? Yes, sir. Shit. Sir, I can't protect you if you don't tell me what's going on. This isn't just a fire. It's a plot. I can't say for sure. I don't need facts. What is your gut telling you? Who's behind this? Kores Botha. I don't understand. If a man like Botha wanted you dead, there are easier ways. He doesn't want me dead. At least not yet. He wants this. And lighting The Pearl on fire is the only way he can get it. Is there something I should know? Yes. The helicopter is ready. Sorry boys. Shit. Go, go, go! Hands up! Ok. Don't shoot. Turn around. Yes! This way. You're doing great. Wait, hold on. Come here. Baby, we're gonna wet these again, ok? Ok, Mommy. Ok, baby. Calm down. Calm down. Ok, one second. What's that sound? It's the fire, baby. Where are we gonna go? I don't know. That's the bridge to the waterfall. We'll keep heading up. Run! Go! Come on. Up the stairs. ok. Keep going. Don't stop. Wait. What is it? That is not our pilot. Botha. Get down! Go, go! Long time, Botha. Yeah. Did you miss me? I see you met my associate. Surprise, surprise. Why don't you just shoot me and take it? You think I'm stupid? You know I can't do that. The men I work for... will kill me... if I don't get it back for them. You should've paid me and been done with it. But no. Clever boys like you always think you can be clever. So how's this for clever? I'm gonna take you, and your drive, and your helicopter. And I'm going to make you watch, as your building burns to ash and there's nothing you can do about it. Look out! Zhao! Zhao! Zhao! Yes. He sealed himself in the penthouse. Open the doors. The penthouse floor has its own subroutine. Zhao must have isolated that system. I can't open the doors with this tablet. Wait. It looks like Will Sawyer's in the building. And I've got a movement alert. It's his family. They're still alive. Zhao! You're not gonna get in using force. You need someone who knows the system. And I know just the man for the job. Sawyer. If anyone can get in, it's him. He's in the building. Just need to find him. We don't need to find him. We know what he wants. If you can't fix it with duct tape... Then you ain't using enough duct tape. All right, you were on the 98th floor, east side stairwell. Means you would've had to go through the park. I'll find you. Hang on. I'll find you. Stay with me, baby. ok? ok. Come on. Almost there. Mrs. Sawyer. Yes. Nice to meet you. I got them. They're in the park. Come on. Kids, too. Do what he says. ok? That's right. Listen to your mummy. It's ok, guys. Everything's gonna be ok. Just do exactly what I say. Run! Mom! Come on! Ok. Come on. Just have to go up a little bit farther. Georgia! Henry! I'll find another way up. Keep going. Go all the way up to the waterfall. I'll go around to the other side. I'll meet you there. Ok. I'm not supposed to kill you, but I think your kids will be enough. Sarah! Are you ok? Yeah, I'm ok. How did you get in the building? It's a long story. Where are the kids? Mom! Dad! God, are you ok? Don't move, all right? Where's your sister? She's at the top of the park by the waterfall. Dad! Honey, stay right there. Daddy's coming for you. Ok. How do we get across the bridge? Let's figure this out. It's gonna be ok, baby. Ok. Shit. The bridge is unstable. All right, we got to do this together. Ok. When I tell you to, walk it out, drop it, and go get him, ok? Ok. All right. What are you gonna do? Will? I'm gonna hold the bridge steady. Hold on, baby. Ok. Go! Ok, baby, here I come. Here I come. Ok. I got you. I got you. Ok. Come back, hurry! That's it. That's it. Come back. Come on. Ok. As still as you can. Ok, we're almost there. No! Mom! You can do it. You can do it. That's it. Get up. I can't hold it anymore! Jump! Ok. Oh my God. Come on. Will, what the hell is going on? I don't know, but I got to get you guys out of this building. Henry can't breathe. I know. It's ok. Georgia, I'll be right there! Ok, Dad. Ok. All right, these elevators operate on electromagnetic induction. When there's a fire, they're held in place by a failsafe brake. When I cut this cable, you're gonna fall. What? Will? It's all right. Just listen to me. You're gonna fall through the fire. The magnets are gonna kick back on once you pass the fire line. But I need you to pull this handle in order to engage the braking system. It's about 500 feet from here until the fire line. I want you to count to five and pull the handle. This is crazy. Trust me. Ok. How you doing, buddy? I'm scared. It's ok to be scared. In order to be brave, we got to be a little scared. All right? Now I need you to be brave right now. Can you do that for me? Yeah. I want you to hold on to your mom. Daddy loves who? Me. That's right. Come here. Ok. Ok. Ok, baby. We're gonna sit down. We're gonna brace ourselves, all right? Ok. I love you. You better. Count with me, baby. Five. Four. Three. Two. One! Mom! Ok. Hey! God. Hey, hey. It's ok. It's ok. We're the good guys. You're safe. Come with us. Daddy! Daddy! Found you. You little shit. Georgia! Come on. Just the man I was looking for. Your Majesty. I hear your dad knows everything about this building. All I care about is what, my business partner is holding behind those doors. And you're going to get it for me. Listen to me. The only way those doors open is from the inside, or the fire alarm on this floor triggers it, but that can't happen because you took the entire system offline. Is that so? Well, let me tell you something. Every man has a weakness. It's easy to find. Once you know what he loves, you have it. Zhao, he loves this building. And you, your weakness, is your family. So now we're going to find out, how much you love your family, Will. Listen to me. Opening those doors from this floor can't be done. Anything can be done, with the proper motivation. No, no, no. No, no... Daddy! Don't hurt him! Stop! Ok, cuzzie. You're gonna bring Zhao and what he's holding behind those doors to me. Or I'm gonna throw your daughter off the fucking roof. I hear it's like heaven up there. No, no, no! Daddy! No! No. Georgia! Georgia! No! Straight to the roof, boys. We're not gonna wait around here to burn. No! Daddy! Daddy! Let me go! Daddy, help me! Daddy! Georgia! Into the destruction of Zhao Long Ji's Pearl tower. We're getting reports of activity on the ground floor of the building. We're going to go live to Kowloon Plaza, where we may have some survivors coming out of the building. It's difficult to imagine how anyone could have survived the raging fire on the upper floors. My dad's inside. He saved us. He's still inside. Is there any other news? He's a good guy! It appears this may be the family of William Sawyer, the American security consultant... Ok. There's got to be a way to open these doors. Where did you put the subroutine panels that controls them? Where did you hide it, Zhao? Behind the turbines? Come on, man. Shit. How did you get out of the building? Can you comment? Sir? And you claim your husband isn't involved? It's not a claim. He's not involved. How many of them did you say you saw? One in a suit, two others in coveralls. The one that I spoke to, he had an accent. Scandinavian, I think. Sixfoot, white, muscular. There. Top row. Second from the right. Is this the man you saw? That's him. Who is he? Kores Botha. Exmilitary. Has a nasty crew with him, too. Highend muscle for three different crime syndicates. Excuse me? One of them was carrying a container, and it had a logo with wings on it, and the word Sirin. Look it up. Come on! This is stupid. This is The Pearl. A BASE jump from 1,000 meters up gives you roughly about two kilometers descent distance. Now, if you're right, they will land somewhere within this circle. Somewhere open and flat, secluded. Now, they wouldn't go for Victoria Park. There's too many trees to get hung up on. South, they wouldn't clear the peak. North, maybe, but it's a longer haul to an open spot. What about this? What's that? That's nothing. It's a construction site. Bay Dredge. You think I would willingly trap my own children in a burning building? I think you could be playing a role. This could all be part of your husband's plan. Take me there. If I am wrong and it's empty, then what have you lost? But if I am right, this might be your only chance to catch the people responsible for this whole thing. My family is in there. Please. My God. Come on, baby. Come on. Come on. Two, three. One, two, three. Ok, easy. Just cut the wire, doors will open, climb back up there. Ok. Shit! Come on. Yeah! Does that look like someone with a plan to you? Now do you believe me? Don't move. You're too close. What? We need to talk. All right, if we're gonna get out of here, you're gonna have to tell me the truth. How does a man like that call you his business partner? His name is Kores Botha. He handles extortion for three powerful crime syndicates. And when I began construction on The Pearl Botha came to me. He said that if I didn't pay him, he'll cripple my labor force and keep me from ever completing this place. You paid him. Yes. But what he didn't know was that I hid tracking software inside my wire transfer. As Botha laundered my payments through their offshore accounts, I was able to trace every transaction, giving me their bank accounts, their names, their identities. This was my insurance policy. Botha would never be able to extort money from me again. But when the syndicates found out that they were compromised, they threatened to destroy Botha if he didn't clean up his mess. If he kills me, the copies I've made will be sent to the authorities. But if he gets his hands on this the original, he can reverse engineer my tracking software and hide the identities before anyone's the wiser. So, he lit this entire building on fire knowing that you would take the most valuable thing in this world to you and run. And his plan worked. Not yet, it hasn't. We're gonna give Botha what he came here for. As soon as he has the drive, he'll kill us both. Maybe. But he has my daughter. And her life is what matters to me, not mine. Now, I'm taking that drive to the roof. You could either be attached to it or not. It's your choice, Zhao. All right. So, what's the plan? You got any duct tape? Daddy! Hey! Mr. Sawyer, see, I knew you'd find a way. You have what's mine, and I have what's yours. Give me the drive. And bring Zhao. No. My daughter first. I can't let you do this. Hey, what are you doing? This is not in the plan. Turn around. He's got my daughter. Please, don't do this to me. Turn around! I want a parachute! You need me alive. A parachute or you get nothing! Give him your parachute. What? Give him your parachute. Bring it here. Stop. Drop it there. Come. Bring the drive. Here's what you want? Go get it. Run! Doors! Come on! Georgia. Daddy! It looks like you were right. We've got armed suspects up ahead. Stay down, don't leave the car. Thanks. You almost had me convinced out there. Let's go find your daughter. Go, go, go! Hey. Go. Go get her. I'm coming back for you. Turn around. Turn around now! You shoot me, I drop this and the girl. Daddy! Disarm now! No, please! Daddy! All right. You win. It's gonna be ok, honey. It's gonna be ok. Now toss me the drive. All right. But there's one thing you should know first. What? I'm behind you. I got you. I got you. I got you. Daddy's got you. What's that? I don't know, she had it on her. It looks like it controls the building. Hey, let's wait for someone who knows what they're doing. My husband and daughter are in that building, it's on fire right now. I'm not gonna wait another damn second. Yes, sir. Come here. Stay down, stay low. I'm gonna find us a way out of here. Ok. What are you doing? I'm trying to bring the fire systems back online. Is it working? Not yet. Daddy! Come here, come here. Come here. Come on. Come on. Daddy's got you. Daddy's got you. Daddy's got you. I got you. I got you. Look at me. Look at me. Daddy loves who? Me. Daddy loves you. Daddy loves you. I'm sorry. No. I'm so sorry. It worked. How the hell did you do that? I rebooted the control systems for the entire building. I turned it off and on again. Zhao! Zhao, let's go. Let's go. Come on. Here. What are you gonna do now? Rebuild. Sarah? One question... Has anyone seen my wife? What about my son? Henry! Sarah! Henry! Sarah! Mom! Dad! You ok? You ok? Are you hurt? No, no, we're ok. I'm ok, Dad. We're fine. We're fine. I love you. I love you, too. You really need a shower. Yes, I do. Let's go home. Yeah. Will Sawyer. Nice to finally meet you. You've got quite a family there. I'm a lucky man. By LESAIGNEUR Sync & corrections October 2018
