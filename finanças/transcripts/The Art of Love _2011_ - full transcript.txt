THE ART OF LOVE (title rip by Edi) "There's no love without music" At the precise moment you fall in love, a special music is produced inside us. Like this one. Or this one. Or even this one. It's different for each of us... and can occur when least expected. For Vanessa, it was while helping William change his bicycle wheel. For Zoë, she thought of Jérémie while out walking. Sometimes two people fall in love at the same time and the two pieces of music match. It was the case with Emmanuelle and with Paul. Laurent dreamed of hearing the music one day. He longed to hear it. Excuse me. Do you have a light, please? He longed to hear it as he was a composer. What could this music sound like? He kept wondering. He'd only ever heard snatches of it. Two or three notes with Annabelle. Scarcely more with Elisabeth. His obsession was such that he tried to imagine it when he composed. Strangely enough, those who listened to his works recognized in them... something they felt when they fell in love... but which he'd never felt. Many congratulated hit, particularly women. A lot of them thought that this tan's company could take them feel deeply in love. Yes... many passed through his arts. And with all his strength, each time, he tried to love them. He hoped he would. But nothing. He never heard the slightest melody. See these white spots here? He was still young when he fell fatally ill. Shortly before he died, whilst out walking alone, he heard some music. He never knew who his heart was in love with. "Don't turn down what you're offered" - You haven’t made love in a year! - Yep, a year. At your age, that's enormous. You should be very active. A year at your age corresponds to 5 in the sexual calendar. Oh, yeah? And it's very important for your health. Studies show that sex fortifies our organism, our brain, our mood. Really? It's almost a hygiene matter. Making love makes people healthier. And thus, reduces health budget costs. - Meet someone. - Easier said than done. You're in a loving relationship. It's not my fault if I'm not. In the meantime, meet people, it'd do you good. I can't. I'm too shy. And I'm uncomfortable, meeting someone just for that. - So, ask a friend. - What? Lots of singles are sex friends. Think of the advantages. My male friends aren't single. Michel's with Joelle, Eric's with Mélanie... - Tristan? - He just met someone. Bernard's in Australia. And Jérémie's with you. Ideally, we should share our men with our single girl friends. You talk such nonsense. I'm serious. I'm in favour of redistributing wealth. You pay tax to the community to help the poor. When you have a country house, you invite friends over. Why not lend your guy to those who don't have one? It should be a tradition. But making love isn't just an ordinary act. See it as a massage, using more than just your hands. You don't have to love your physio for him to massage you. Just think about it. What'd you say if Jérémie slept with another woman? Him sleeping with someone behind my back or because I ask him... are two different things. If he slept with you to do you good, I wouldn't be jealous, I'd be proud of him. Hello. I asked Jérémie and he said OK. OK to what? - What we said: Doing you good. - But... Listen... Please say yes. It'll do you good. Well... - OK. - Great! How are you? I was just going to the cinema. Jérémie. Jérémie. Isabelle's here. - Hi, Isabelle. - Hi. Well, see you later. Back at 9. Stay for dinner. I can't. I'm seeing my mother. Well, I'll call you, then. Enjoy the film. - Want a drink? - No, thanks. Let's go in the bedroom. After you. The two friends had no secrets, but Isabelle didn't dare share her dream. However, something very troubling happened... I've been thinking about what you said. How can you go a year without making love? You're in the prime of life. A year is enormous. If you don't want to sleep with a stranger, ask a friend. Isabelle listened, troubled by her words, but above all, troubled to see her dream unfolding. Sex friends are very common. She pinched herself. No, it wasn't a dream. You can do someone good even if you love someone else. That's friendship. Their girlfriends don't necessarily agree. I agree. If Jérémie agreed to do you good, I'd be quite happy. I'd be proud of him. What if I asked him? - No way. - Why not? You're joking. - It's embarrassing. - I'm not embarrassed. - I am. - Up to you. I'm sure Jérémie wouldn't mind. - It's not done. - Why not? We're free, aren't we? - That's not the point. It's... - It's what? Give it a try. You look like I'm torturing you. I won't force you. - I'm late, gotta run. Call me. - OK. Thanks. No problem. They never mentioned it again. Isabelle never knew if she was right or wrong to refuse. "Desire is fickle and dances like grass in the wind" Hello, Jeanne. It's Achille. We met at Marc's party 3 months ago. No... No, it's... I asked him for your number. As I enjoyed our discussion, albeit short, I thought maybe... As I'm free this weekend, we could have a drink. Never mind. OK, well... Some other time, huh? Bye. Hello, Françoise. It's Achille. I'm calling to hear your news. You were asleep? Well... as it's 10 o'clock... No, I'm sorry. Sleep tight. 'Morning. Sorry to bother you. I live next door. I went to get the mail, but on the way back... the door shut in the breeze. Could I use your phone to call a locksmith? OK. No, it's not reinforced. Thank you. He has one more person to see first. Thank you. And if you ever need anything, just knock. Thanks, goodbye. You're not going to wait on the landing. You haven't lived here long. I never saw you before. No, not even a week. - Were you in Paris? - Oh, yes. Not far away. 2 subway stations away. Thanks. The thing is, my boyfriend and I split up. I understand. I don't suppose it can be easy for you. Maybe not, but it's interesting. I haven't lived alone before. - And how does it feel? - It's good. Well, it's still too early to say. And it may not last long. Maybe I'll go back to my boyfriend or... You haven't really split up? I don't know. It depends. We'll have to see. He'd like to. But I'm not sure. It was a shock to learn he'd been cheating on me for months. Don't look like that. It happens. I'm a very positive person. I think every cloud has a silver lining. Maybe... I haven't known enough men to... understand being a couple. And you know... I have no idea what it's like physically with other men. See what I mean? For instance, maybe I should have an affair. - What do you think? - Lf you feel the need... maybe you should listen to what's happening inside. You think so? I'm just saying. It's up to you. No, you're right, I'll try. What about you? Without wishing to be indiscreet, do you live alone? I'm single at the moment. - How do you find it? Is it OK? - Yes. So, you have some time? More than if I was with someone. Great, so we can see more of each other? Yes, why not? Do you have your diary to make some dates? Do you want to dance? Yes, if you like. - Let's forget what just happened. - Why? - Because. - Because what? Because... it's not natural. - What's not natural? - The fact that you kissed me. I kissed you naturally. - I don't think so. - I did. Would you have if I hadn't said all that? Well, yes. I think you did it, because I said I wanted an affair. No. - That's not the feeling I have. - I assure you I didn't. - Don't you like me? - I do. So do I. Pity. - The locksmith... - Wait. You mean you'd be OK with it if you hadn't said what you said? Yes. "It's hard to give the way you'd like" Thanks. You OK? You look like something's wrong. No, I assure you, I'm fine. - It's just that... - Just what? - I'm wondering... - Wondering? - About what? - About myself. - I'm not satisfied with myself. - What's wrong? Apparently, everything's fine. I'm in a relationship, my career isn't a worry, I have friends, I'm healthy, and yet something's missing. Like what? Like my life lacks meaning. I'm too selfish. I'd like to be more generous. Give something to people. For some reason, I rarely get the chance. You could do volunteer work for a charity. Yes, I thought of that, but I could only do it at weekends, but we go to the country. I can't deprive Ludo of his pleasure when I want to be generous, see? Anyway, if you want to ask me for something, do, even if it seems too much. - Alright? - Alright. - Promise? - I promise. I can't wait. What's with the funny face? - It's nothing. - It isn't. Something to ask me? - No. - I can see you have. - No, it's nothing. - Nothing is something. No... Boris, please... It'd make me so happy. - It's too much to ask. - No, I want it to be too much. I want it to be huge, to be excessive. Amélie, you should know I would never have asked if you hadn't insisted. Never. I'm listening. Here goes... Although you're my friend, I'm not indifferent to you. My attraction to you has kept growing. Attraction? Dreams, fantasies... Urges. Why didn't you tell me? In case you took it badly. And because of Ludo... I don't see what I can do to help you. Maybe you could help me to see clearer. I sometimes wonder if I'm not in love with you. It has a negative effect on my relationships. I keep thinking it'd be better with you. - No. - That's what I tell myself. What can I do? - No. - Just so I know. I'd never live up to your fantasy. I'd like to help, but I can't because of Ludo. I'm sorry. - Forgive me. - No, I'm sorry. Hey, lady. You dropped your scarf. Thank you, that's very kind. Can you spare some change? I'm sorry, I gave it all to the florist. I swear I did. I'd like to help... Do you have a cigarette? I just gave up. I'd really like to help you out... - Want the bouquet? - No, thanks. - Are you sure? - Bye, ma'am. Hello, Margot. - I'll get that. - No, it's OK. I insist. You're home already. Yes, I came home early. We didn't get the Swedish contract. - A month's work for nothing. - I'm sorry. If you feel like a change, I'll invite you out for a meal. I don't feel like going out. - Bye, ma'am. - Bye. How about a cocktail? No, thanks. A nice sandwich? No, thanks. A skull massage? It's OK. - Some music? - No. - What would you like? - I don't know. - Ludovic! - What? Cote here. - What? - Cote here. I have a surprise. - What surprise? - Cote here. You'll see. It's Jérome. I'll pick up. Yes? Really? Hang on, I'll ask Amélie. He feels down. I'll have a drink to cheer him up. You don't mind? - No, no. - OK, I'll be right there. I'm off. Don't wait for me for dinner. 'Night. It's you. 'Evening. I wondered who it was. I'm out of salt. Could you spare some, seeing as it's late? - Of course. Come in. - Thanks. - Sorry, there's hardly any left. - That's OK. Give me your hand, we'll share it. - Is that OK? - Perfect. I'm working tonight, but let's do dinner. - Why not? - So we can talk. Well, I wanted to say something. - Now? - Yes. When I kissed you, it was because I wanted you. I like desire to be spontaneous, not planned. - It wasn't planned. - It's hard to think otherwise. You kissed me when I mentioned the affair. Well, I was waiting for the right moment. Then, it all happened so fast. - Your desire wasn't strong enough. - It was. It was very strong. See? You use the past tense, as if it's over. Not at all. It's still very strong. It's even stronger. Let's kiss, you'll see. No, it's too late. The more we talk, the more artificial it is. Forget it. Once we've forgotten it, maybe we'll be able to kiss naturally. "Without danger, pleasure is less intense" Emmanuelle? What's wrong? I'm leaving you, my love. I'm crying, because I'm leaving you. What do you mean? Please, don't ask me why. You should just know I love you. I'm so sorry. If you knew how sorry I am... How can I not ask you why? Try to see it my way. Is there someone else? Is that it? Someone else in your life? Nobody in particular. - What do you mean? - There are several. - Several? - Yes. But it keeps changing. I haven't cheated on you yet, but I can't restrain myself for long. Look, I don't understand a word. I'll listen to anything, but explain things to me. A few months ago, when I met certain men, I started to get overcome... I was overcome with desire, despite myself. I didn't tell you. I thought it'd pass. But it just got worse. I thought it could be hormonal, so I had tests done. But there was nothing wrong with me. It just went on, so I thought it was psychological. I went to see a shrink. - What did he say? - Nothing specific yet. I've started therapy. I have to wait, it can take years. My desires can't wait. It's become hellish lately. If a man looks at me with desire, I want to satisfy him. I have to restrain myself with all my strength. It can happen to me at work or on the bus or when shopping, anytime. I spend my days, restricting this hunger. It's exhausting. I don't want to cheat on you, but it's beyond me. I can't fight my own body anymore. I did all I could for us. I can't do any more. And I don't want to hurt you. I'll move into Eléonore's place. She's away for 2 months. Then, I'll see. All night, Paul walked the streets of Paris. He went from Rue de Moscow, near St Lazare, via the Opéra, the Louvre, along the Seine to the Jardin des Plantes, which was of course shut, he crossed the Seine, reached Aoe. Dautesnil, and walked to the Bois de Vincennes. He stopped in the park, turned around, and went straight home. Wait. I've been thinking. There may be a solution if you want to try. I know you're leaving so I don't suffer, but I'd suffer less if you stayed. Paul... I won't stop you giving in to your desires. You can do what you want. I want to be there to hold you when you need a hug. When you come home. What do you think? Finally free to experience her desires, she could at last look at ten without feeling guilty. - Do you want a coffee? - Yes, please. - Thanks. - Don't mention it. From the gentleman on your left. She could give free rein to her urges, without feeling guilty. However, something very strange happened: She only slept with one tan. Indeed, she'd come back to Paul without giving in to her urges. The freedom he'd given her had chained her to hit. The attraction she felt for other ten only rejoiced and intensified Paul's desire. So much so that she found in hit all the ten she desired. Hey, it's me. How are you? Are you free Saturday? Yes. Where shall we meet? - Is your place OK? - Yes. Fine. Bye. - Hi. Good to see you. - You OK? Yes. I've got champagne. Is that OK? Do you want to get me drunk to take advantage of me? No, I had some in, that's all. It'd have been more flattering if it was to get me drunk. How so? It would've showed you still desired me. I have no effect on you now? - You do, but... - But? You're so frank that I'm a bit unsettled. I told you I liked things to be natural, spontaneous. - Let's get to the point, OK? - OK. For example, what do you want right now? No, don't think. Just say it. I think I want to kiss you. You think? - You're not sure? - I am sure. If you're sure, why not do it? Well, I'm waiting for you. It's awkward, kissing someone who doesn't want to. - Who says I don't want to? - Nothing tells me you do want to. I called you, I came to see you. You came to see me last time, too. I thought you wanted to and I was wrong. I did want to, but the circumstances were wrong. Are they right now? I don't know. I feel like a traffic light. A traffic light? You're waiting for me to turn green. The pressure. - I haven't done a thing. - Exactly. What's wrong? I've only ever kissed Wilfried. You've never? What about last time? That doesn't really count. - Not right away. - Why not? It's too new. - Some other time. - When? I don't know. I'll call you. "Make sure infidelities retain unknown" This story begins on a Sunday and ends on a Friday. William and Vanessa are in love. They met when they were 12. Their friendship kept growing. Something special takes their love grow. Before they were lovers, they were friends. When they got together, they promised to preserve their friendship. This teams that they talk freely and never cramp each other's freedom. Since we got together, I haven't slept around. I know. I may sleep with someone just once before he goes away. I wasn't going to tell you, but I dislike secrets. We said we'd be entirely open. - You in love with him? - Not at all, but I like him and he's nice. He wants me so much, it makes me want him. Do you see? - Where did you meet? - At work. His name's Louis. He's going to work in Brazil next week. You see, there's no danger. Maybe I shouldn't have said. No, on the contrary. I'd rather you told me. In fact, I'm very grateful. I just wasn't expecting it. I may not manage to sleep with him. I wonder how I'll react. - I may panic. - Vanessa, I'm sorry. Why? I'm afraid I won't manage. I won't stop thinking of you... - I'm sorry, I'm too weak. - That guy doesn't matter. What matters is us. I won't go. I've changed my mind. I want you to see this guy. No, it was a bad idea. I don't want to hurt you. I've been thinking. I reacted too brusquely earlier. I don't want you to regret it one day. I won't regret it. You don't know. You notice overtime. We said it's better to have remorse than regret. We should love freedom, not fear it. Fear is inward-looking. We promised not to be inward-looking, didn't we? Monday Louis! Coming. Are you OK? So? - It's yes. - Really? - Thank you. - Careful. - What? - What if we're seen? Sorry. I have to go. See you later. Till Friday. Tuesday William... What is it? - I can't manage... - Can't manage what? Not to be jealous. I don't want you to go. I feel stupid. I'm mad at myself. Wednesday Vanessa? - What's wrong? - There's a problem. Friday's not going to work. Why not? Don't ask questions. I can't. - I just can't. - That's not possible. You know I'm going far, faraway. - We may never meet again. - I know, but that's how it is. But you promised. I've longed for this day. It's as if I had a date with my best memory. Don't insist. I can't be there on Friday. If you can't on Friday, let's spend the day together on Thursday. Thursday - See you tonight. - See you tonight. Vanessa, I have to tell you something. I'm not going to Brazil. - Why not? - Because of you. - Thanks to you. - I don't understand. I've loved you from the first second I saw you. As if I recognized you, as if I'd been waiting for you. I know a chance like this only happens once. You know I'm with someone I love. If you really loved him, you wouldn't be here. You're wrong. We said this would be our first and last moment together. I never let you think anything was possible between us. - You did. - I didn't. The way you are with me, the way you look at me. But it's because... I like you. - That's all. - That's all? I didn't know you were in love or I wouldn't have come. - What're you doing? - I'm leaving. Please... Let's make love as if I hadn't said it. - Now I know you love me, I can't. - Why not? Because I'm in love. I thought we were on the same wavelength, that things'd be simple between us. - You OK? - No, I'm not. Really? We have to talk. - What about? - Us. Is something wrong? I want you to spend the evening with that guy. - Wasn't it tomorrow night? - Listen... - Let's not discuss it. - We must. I couldn't think of anything else today. Now I've seen reason, I won't change my mind. Call him and say yes. I already cancelled. It'd be ridiculous to call back. You don't want to hurt me? Let's turn the page. It may hurt me a bit, but it'll help us grow. We grow through trials, new experiences. We mustn't be afraid of experiences. I don't want you to blame me for it one day. I won't. I haven't finished. Here goes... If I had a date tomorrow night, I'd rather you see this guy than wait home alone. - You mean? - Yes. She's an intern. She leaves in 2 weeks and goes back home. We'll share the same experience. It'll bring us closer together. Friday You're very beautiful. You're very handsome. See you later. See you later. The minutes were as long for hit as for her. As long as their imagination was fertile. So many images went through their minds. You OK? Did it go well? Yes, more or less. - And you? - Yeah. So-so. - But... was it interesting? - Yes, interesting. You don't regret it? No. No, it was an experience. - Do you regret it? - No, it was instructive. - Did you learn things? - Not really. Are you disappointed? There are things in life you have to try. That's exactly what I think. Now we can say we've tried them. - It means we can move on. - Yes. I missed you. Me too. Are you tired? I feel like the night is just beginning. "Patience, but not too much" I’m out right now, but leave a message. Hello, it's Achille, your neighbour. I haven't heard from you in several days. I hope you're well. And I'd like to see you. And... I really want to kiss you. I really liked your message. I hadn't heard from you. It was kinda complicated. - Do you want a drink? - No. A nibble? No. Sit down? No. - No. - What's wrong? Don't you want to? - Yes, but... - But what? I don't know if I'm in love yet. That doesn't matter. It's important to be sure you're in love first. - Maybe it'll come later. - I prefer to know first. But... Maybe you are, but you don't know it yet. Making love will help you realize. What about you? Are you in love? I think so. - You're not sure. - You're taking me off guard. I haven't thought about it yet. What if you thought about it now? I think so. I feel things. What kind of things? Things... Very pleasant things. Me too. If we make love, I'm sure we'll have proof of it. So, you see it as a test. I think it's too soon to take it further. Let's let things mature. Not force things. I don't understand. You wanted an affair. An affair is like an adventure. You don't ask questions, you explore the unknown. Yes, well, I'm not sure I want an affair anymore. I haven't told you everything. Things have changed. It's really over with my boyfriend. I wanted an permit to answer questions about our relationship, but now I don't really need one. And making love for its own sake... isn't really the way I work. To me, it's something sacred. It's because it's sacred that we should celebrate it. See it as a ceremony in which we pay tribute to nature. That's right. You know, desire grows in us like leaves on a tree. - I like that. - What? "Desire grows in us like leaves." - What're you doing? - Noting it. "...like leaves on a tree." It almost makes me want to... To? Nothing. You say you like things to be natural. When nature expresses itself, you refuse it. Come now. We can't help it. That's nature for you. All the atoms inside us are attracted. Didn't we say we'd just kiss? It doesn't mean we can't get naked. It's too much. - Why? - It makes me want to do it. Doesn't it when I kiss you? Yes, but if you strip me, it throws me. It throws me, too. If you knew how much I want you. I can't stand it. You're not going? I'm sorry, I'm not easy-going enough for you. Where do you find the strength to resist? I'm like everyone else. You resist, too. How so? - Do you feel strong desire for me? - Yes, very strong. Are you resisting jumping on me? Absolutely. So, you're not giving in to your desire. You can hold yourself in check, too. Keep in touch. "Often our eyes lead us to love. Sometimes they deceive us" Amélie continued to see Boris. But she couldn't help thinking of his attraction for her, or rather, for her body. She had trouble imagining the intensity of his desire. He didn't let anything show. They'd both sworn not to mention it again. This secret spoiled her pleasure at seeing hit. It wasn't like before. But she didn't dare see hit less regularly. It'd have punished hit for a mistake she made hit take. Besides... was it a mistake to desire her involuntarily? Oh, it's over with Marie. - You broke up? - Yes, at the weekend. - Didn't you get on well with her? - Yes, but there was no magic. Be honest, did you leave her because of me? What're you talking about? Your attraction for me which interferes with your relationships. No. We agreed not to mention it. Yes, I know. But I don't want to be indirectly responsible. Forget it. It's not your fault if I rave over your body. Your desire for me is bad for our friendship. I know, but there's nothing I can do about it. You have to taste me. Amélie had read a scientific article on sexual inhibition. It tried to analyze the mechanisms of what's commonly called "modesty". It said the main agents of moral surveillance are sight and sound. Experiments by Prof. Lavigne show that ten deprived of sight and sound give in much more easily to their sexual urges. Amélie thought that to overcome her modesty, they should try out similar conditions: A darkened hotel root, without turning the light on or saying a word. They shouldn't see or hear one another. These were the only conditions for Amélie to give her body to Boris's desire. Well? OK. Amélie had booked a hotel on the net for the Friday. At 4 PM, she was to go there, take it completely dark. Then, at 4:15, Boris was to enter. At 5:15, an alarm would signal that it was over. Boris was to leave first, then Amélie 15 minutes later. On the Wednesday, 2 days before the date, Amélie left work early. She was overcome with anxiety. - Oh, Isabelle. - Amélie. How incredible. I'm pleased to see you. She forgot her anxiety for a while, she was so pleased to run into Isabelle after so many years. They'd been close friends, but lost touch. Isabelle had recently moved into Amélie's neighbourhood. When Amélie heard Isabelle was single, an idea came into her head. What could I do? He's my best friend. She dared to tell her about the embarrassing situation she was in. Of course she hid Boris's identity, though Isabelle didn't know hit. There. I thought I could do it, but I see now I can't. I'm simply incapable of being unfaithful. I don't know why. I'd like to, but I can't. And Ludo has been so kind lately that I'd feel even worse... Do you see what I mean? Won't you go instead? - What? - You could replace me. - Are you serious? - Yes. - Why me? - I don't know... I run into you. And you're single, aren't you? And you don't know each other. There's no commitment. How tall are you? - 1 meter 69. - I'm 1.68. - And your bra size? - 32b. Me too. - And your panties? - Small. See? We're practically twins. Well? As she feverishly awaited Isabelle's reply, Isabelle thought of her dream and the offer she'd turned down. Listen... Here's my perfume, just in case... So, on Friday at 3:50, Isabelle arrives at the hotel. At 3:56, she has her root key. At 3:59, she enters the root. At 4:11, she turns on the alarm clock. At 4:16, Boris cotes to the door, sees the key, the sign that everything's ready. He knocks 3 times to signal his presence and enters. Boris leaves the hotel at 5:27. Isabelle leaves about 15 minutes later, according to plan. Around 6:30, Amélie calls Isabelle to see if everything went as planned. Isabelle reassures her, saying it went fine. Although Amélie is curious to know tore, she doesn't dare ask. That's lucky as Isabelle doesn't want to confide, even in a friend. And she hasn't yet had time to understand what she felt. Amélie doesn't see Boris again till 6 days later. They'd agreed not to mention what had happened. So, they endeavoured not to. - How are you otherwise? - Fine, and you? Fine. Amélie longed to know if the experience had suited Boris. She hoped that by talking casually, she'd see what had changed in hit. - Did your week go well? - Yes. And you? Yes. I had a cold, but it's gone now. - And you? - No, no. - I didn't have a cold. - Oh, right. - So, everything went well? - Yes. - That's good. - Yes. Amélie was too impatient. She thought that if they couldn't talk about it, they could discuss the effects to find out if the goal had been attained. How have you been since the last time we met? I told you. Fine. No, I mean... your problem with my appearance... Is that solved? Sorry, I didn't think we'd come right out with it. I'm very uncomfortable. I can see you are, too. To tell you the truth, I can't say. It all seemed so short. Too many discoveries, too many new things in too short a time. Don't you think? Let's start again one more time, in the same conditions. Then I can tell you. It's too vague right now. Alright? - He wants to start again. - Why? I didn't really understand. Too much was new about the situation for him. He thinks it'll be clearer next time. So, that's why I wanted to ask you to replace me again. Isabelle pulled a face, as if she didn't like the idea. She looked doubtful, as if she were thinking it over. She didn't want Amélie to think she'd accept for pleasure. Amélie fully understood, so she didn't use any arguments to persuade her. It really helps you if I go? Sure you don't want to go this time? Amélie was surprised by the question. As she shook her head, for a moment she hesitated to herself. Then, she forgot it. Back at 4:30 The date was in the same hotel, with the same arrangements. Amélie had already heard from Isabelle that it'd gone as planned. Suddenly... "I love you, I love you, I love you." She reread the message. "I love you, I love you, I love you." - Are you OK? - No, Boris, I'm not. - What's the meaning of that? - It means what it says. I love you, Amélie. Isn't it wonderful? Why did I take so long to realize? I thought it was just physical, but the body is the reflection of the soul. Boris, I'm not in love with you. I know it's hard to admit. I didn't believe it, at first. But you're as in love as I am. I know you are. You proved it twice. Such complicity can't exist if it's not shared. Your body, your skin, your gestures told me you love me. I know it's harder for you to admit than for me as I'm single. But you have to face it. Ludo will get over it, and we don't have a moment to lose. Boris. She considered telling the truth, but that would’ve betrayed and compromised Isabelle. Boris, I... don't know what to say. Let's not see each other for a while. It'll pass. Amélie, it won't pass. This is unique. I've never felt it before. Why waste time? I can't be without you. I just want us to be together. I understand you being scared, feeling lost, but I'm here. If you think I'll wait while you go astray, you're wrong. I won't give you a second's respite. The only rest we'll find is in each other's arms. Look, I'm sorry, I'm late. I have to go. When'll I see you? I don't know. I'll call you, OK? Excuse me. Of course not, Boris. Sure I'll put her on. Here. It's Boris. The following days, at any time of the evening or night, Boris kept calling, asking to see her. No, Boris, it's not possible. Stop calling me. No, it's nighttimes. I'm having dinner with friends. Now's not the time. I'll hang up, OK? I'm hanging up. Bye, sweetie. Look at it in daylight. So? Excuse me. Boris, I'm working. I don't believe this. I'm working. Excuse me. Even her mail box was full of messages. She was worried she'd be found out. I'll get that. Wrong number. Look, I'd rather not know what went on between you, but he's convinced I'm his dream woman. - We should come clean. - I don't agree. I accepted as long as it remained anonymous. Maybe you'd like him? - Maybe, but I'd rather not see him. - What if you did like him? - Anyway, he'd never like me. - Nonsense. He's in love with you, not me. He has you in his head. If he realizes I'm not you, he'll be disappointed. Isabelle agreed to replace Amélie. Amélie agreed to meet Boris as long as he respected her conditions. She warned and threatened hit: If he pulled any stunts, she'd stop seeing hit. She also set up a system of communication so that Ludo wouldn't suspect anything. They all created a new email address: Amélie became Alice Wonder. Boris became Hector Hugo. Just a second, sir. And Isabelle became Superwotan364. I'm coming. So, Alice received Hector's dates and sent the times to Superwotan364. Back at 5 Back at 3:30 Back at 6:30 This system seemed to satisfy Boris who'd stopped calling Amélie. She almost managed to forget hit. However, she couldn't help thinking it was all very precarious. She decided to force Destiny's hand. Amélie arranged to meet Isabelle, supposedly to go shopping together. She took her to a shop window, then a second, then a third, then as she went past a bookstore, she stopped casually. Incredible. A friend of mine works here. Let's go in and say hello. - Come on. - Sure. Boris, are you there? - You OK? - Yes, you? Well, we happened to be in the area. I thought we'd call in and say hi. Isabelle, a close friend. Hello. Actually, we'd lost touch, but Isabelle now lives near me. Do you know each other? - No. - No. I say that, because Isabelle's a bookseller, too. - My bookstore's on Rue Vauquelin. - I don't know it. Isn't it incredible you're both booksellers? - Do you want to have a look? - Another time. We won't have time to do what we planned. Oh, OK. Well, we'll go. Let's go. Bye. Keep in touch. Goodbye. - Boris is single, you know? - So? - Aren't you single? - I am, but he's not my type. - He's cute. - I don't like his looks. And his literary tastes seem dubious. - Don't exaggerate. - Don't you think? No. I think he's very handsome. Hey, it's not him, is it? - What? - Him. No, of course not. I'd have warned you. I'd never do that. You had me worried. - Pretty, aren't they? - Yeah. Excuse me. I have to tell Boris something. I clean forgot. I'll be right back. I'm pleased you came. I've missed you. - What did you think of my friend? - I barely saw her. - But do you find her attractive? - You're all that matters to me. I know, but if I didn't exist, what would you think? Insignificant. Not my type. I find her almost unpleasant. - Really? - What do you want to know? It's just that as she's single, I'm asking around. - Excuse me. - Just a sec. Can you help? I want a book on the complexity of feelings. - I gotta run. - See you later. - Really? - We're meeting at 1. Oh, yes. Follow me. - I bought them. - Great. - Let's go this way. - No, I gotta go. I have a date at 1. I want to go home first. Bye. The dates still continued. - It's been a long time. - Yeah. Now that Isabelle and Boris had met, Amélie invited them when she saw friends. Isabelle, how are you? I already introduced you. Remember, he works in... in a bookstore. - Remember, she's a bookseller. - Yes, of course. Remember Boris? A bookseller. We went to his bookstore. Yes, I... I remember. All this could’ve continued for ages if a traveller hadn't brought into the hotel an insect in his case. False alarm. Panic over. everything's OK. The next few days, Amélie was surprised not to hear from Boris. She asked Isabelle. But Isabelle thoughtfully decided not to say anything. She didn't want to blame Amélie for lying to her about Boris's identity. Yes... she hated embarrassing people as their embarrassment embarrassed her even tore. Amélie was reassured to see Boris was still alive. But Boris no longer contacted her. She often wondered why he'd fallen out of love. Although it was salutary, she felt a certain sadness. Boris had been her best friend. He left a hole in her life. Isabelle and Boris ran into each other once. At a birthday party. Zoë’s. - Oh, come in. - It's raining. You're soaked. I'll bring you a towel. Hello. Are you OK? Thanks. - I'll take a look. - Dry yourself. Boris was there with a friend of a friend. He didn't know anyone. - Hi. - Hi. That's all they said all evening. What could they have said?
