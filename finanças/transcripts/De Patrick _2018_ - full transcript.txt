Patrick. - Patrick. Honestly! l told you, put the suntan lotion in. l can see it from here. Patrick. lt's not in here. - lt is. Patrick. - Hi, Patrick. Patrick. Hello, Patrick. Patrick. - Patrick. Chantal, Bernard. There you go. Well? -That's not good. What have l got left? Eleven, twelve and twenty. lf l were you, l'd take eleven. OK? - OK. lt's nice. Can you pass me some bread, son? Thank you. Patrick says one of his hammers is missing. He probably left it somewhere, eh? He says he didn't. lt can't have just vanished, can it? Come on, let's go and see what Herman the windbag has to say. ls it about that water again? What do you think? So, what's on the agenda? lt's... the showers. Right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. The last two showers at the back still aren't working. Correction. The last shower does work but there is only cold water. Yes, correction. That's true. The last shower at the back does work but the water is cold. That is... - l'm just saying what's written here. As chairman l'm obliged to adhere to the items on the agenda. Too much water is being wasted. How often do l have to tell you? That may be true. But how often have we been without water this summer? Do l have to tell you how it works, Herman? You need money. There's enough money in the till, isn't there? You always have things under control. That's all gone on the generator and the lights here. l think it'd be handy to have an overview of the admin, the bookkeeping. l think there's too much thinking being done. There isn't any money. And no big jobs will be carried out, we'll just carry on as we are. ls that clear? Patrick? Patrick? Come on. Hello. l'd like to stay for three nights, maybe four nights. OK, l've got twelve, twenty... And thirty-five. -Thirty-five looks great. Thirty-five. What is your name? - My name? You don't know my name? You don't know my name? You don't recognise me? Oh baby, you knew when we started You were gonna end up broken-hearted Baby, you knew that And you came along anyway l'm Dustin Apollo. - OK, can you write it down? That's cool you don't know my name. That's really cool. The bathroom is here, always take a... -You've never heard... Don't you worry, baby We're gonna be flne We don't need to rush lt We'll just take our tlme So the bathroom is... -That's cool, man. That's cool. The river starts here. Treeline starts here. What's your name? Patrick. - l like you, Patrick. So, the bathroom is here. Always take a towel with you. The river starts here and the treeline starts here. Hey, has Nathalie arrived yet? Nathalie? -Yeah. Very beautiful, incredible eyes. She's got blonde hair, smells like honey. No. l thought we could maybe run a bath this evening. See you later. - See you later. Goddammit, Patrick. You're so hot! Sorry about Herman. He's really wound up. Due to that business with the till and stuff. Nice chair. -Yeah. l just need to oil it. Here. lt's apricot. Hi. l'm looking for Dustin Apollo. Nathalie? Yes. He's at 35. We're here. Thanks. Hold on. l'll take you. You're naked. -Yes. ls it obligatory? - No, you can do whatever you want. Sorry. Thanks, thank you. Hi. Hi, finally here. - Hi. l thought we would leave together from Brussels. No, l thought that... Sorry. That's my fault. l thought we were going separately and that you needed the time. No, l... l've been waiting for you all night. And then, this morning Susanne told me you had already left so l had to get a bus here. Well, and now you're here, so everything's perfect. Yeah... Who is... She's staying here. - OK. Hello? - Patrick? He's dead. They're bringing me home. Oh, Patrick. - Mon. Are you OK, son? -Yes. l heard he was taken to St Joseph's. lt's a good hospital. Yes. -Yes. lt can't be easy for you, running everything all by yourself now, eh? Are you sure you're OK, son? l've lost my hammer. lf there's one thing l learned during all my years in the force, it's that things don't just disappear. Either someone took it or you mislaid it. But it didn't run off. Use method and logic to find it. Remember where you last left the hammer lying around. Where? When? Who was there? And, above all, don't let yourself be guided by your emotions. Never. Because if you let your emotions guide you, you lose all objectivity. Then you start looking in the wrong places, in the wrong direction. Believe me. And that's not good. Oh, Patrick. Good morning, son. - Hello, Bert. Cup of coffee? - No, thank you. l've just had some. How's the old man doing? ls he chasing the nurses around yet? Eh? - He's dead. What did you say? - l came to see if l left my hammer here. What? l came to see if l left my hammer here. l... l don't know... uh, Patrick, go and take a look. l thought l may have left it behind when l made that built-in cupboard. Rudy. Goddammit. No. No. No. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, fuck. l can't believe it. l didn't find it. Patrick. Patrick. My condolences, Patrick. To you and your mother and... Sabrina can't believe it. l keep telling her it's true. But... she doesn't believe me. - Patrick. Patrick? Patrick? l've lost my hammer. Hi. Hi. Um... Patrick. There's a quarrel going on at number 35. Oh, Patrick. Patrick, l know the area of each pitch can change every year, as can the boundary, but the party in question has to be informed before the end of April. You have to communicate, pal. -Yeah. l'm not exactly sure what you mean. -Which number is this here? Eh? 35. - 35. 35. That's the spot Patrick gave us. - 35? But that's impossible. We have 35 every year. And 35 goes from there behind our caravan until there, at least five more metres, and that's where 36 begins. Eh? Michael comes every week, Patrick knows this. Patrick, you know Michael likes us to put him there. Besides, how long have we been asking you to keep 36 free? Eh? Yeah... Maybe l wrote it down wrongly or something. Wrote it down wrongly, Patrick? For God's sake. OK, well, the good news is that we're in a forest. She'll just have to... You'll just have to move your tent. lt's as simple as that. - No. l'm not moving it... Hey, hey. Hey, hey. Hey, hey. Jos?e. Jos?e, Wilfried. Take it easy. l don't need to tell you we're all stressed out, eh? After what happened to Rudy. Patrick already has enough to deal with, OK? l want to apologise on behalf of the whole campsite. Normally we are very welcoming and friendly around here. Are we not? Eh? Eh? l suggest that we give the young couple Helga's caravan in compensation. She died last year. What do you reckon? He says we can use the caravan. - Oh. Thank you, Patrick. Thank you very much. How are you doing? We're all really upset about Rudy's death. Really upset. Liliane too... She is. lf you need anything, Patrick, then... Eh? l no longer sell your hammer, Patrick. l've changed supplier and they no longer do this brand. l've got lots of others. Steel ones, titanium ones, everything you could want. l know saying this isn't good for business but... lt's true it's not the same. OK, seeing as it's you. l'll call Brussels. Hello, J?rome? Yes. Tell me, the Teigler 5-23D hammer series, do you still do them? Yes, please. Go ahead. He's going to look in the catalogue. Yes. lf he hasn't got any, then that's it. Yes, go ahead. Yes. Yeah? Oh, right. Yes, OK. Yeah, yeah. Yes. Yes. Perfect. Yes. Thank you. Have a good day. Right. They stopped making that model six years ago. lt's no longer in the catalogue. l'm sorry. l would have liked to have been able to tell you differently. But there you are. You're thinking that a lovely series of twelve with a new hammer among them isn't right. l know, l thought the same thing, Patrick. l said to myself he may as well buy a whole new set. Go on, try it. Go on. lt will never be the same, of course. Take it, try it out a bit. Take it home for a week or two and... 8 P.M. - BlG LAKE l KNOWWHERE YOUR HAMMER lS! Patrick. Where is my hammer? l didn't put my name on that note. -Where's my hammer, Wilfried? l can put my caravan here for free for two whole summers. One summer. And 35 and 36 are always for me, no exception. OK. Where is my hammer? Wilfried. Patrick. - Henk. Uh, come in, Patrick. l don't know how to put it, Patrick. l wanted to make a little table for the TV and l've got my own tools, of course, but l thought, with the long bolts l thought Patrick's hammer would be ideal and then l took it. Sorry, Patrick. l apologise. Where is it now? l was using it. l went for a coffee. lt was lying there on the table. And when l got back it wasn't there anymore. l will make it up to you, Patrick. l promise l will. Honestly. They stopped making that series six years ago. Tell me what you want, Patrick. Anything, l'll do it. l just hope our relationship won't... Oh, hi, Patrick. What a nice surprise. Want to stay to dinner? There's plenty. Sabrina. l borrowed Patrick's hammer without asking. Did you? And now l've lost it. -Typical. lt was there on the table. Oh, the hammer on the table? l used it. l took it. Dustin was putting a tent up and didn't have anything for the pegs so l fetched the hammer. l had to reschedule Lisbon. So now it is Milan, Rome, Madrid, Lisbon. lnstead of Lisbon, Madrid, Milan, Rome. What do you think? Dustin? l think l'm ready to do a jazz album. l'm pregnant. Oh my God. l'm so happy. That's amazing. Wow. Wow. - l think we should live together. What? What's with this obsession? What is... What... l'm not pregnant. Hi, Patrick. Sabrina says you've got my hammer. - Hammer? Oh, that hammer? Was it yours? l gave it back. To Sabrina? She says she gave it back. -To me? l put it back on that tree trunk. -Then it must still be there, eh? Patrick. l really am sorry about this. Anyone could have taken it. -These things happen, Patrick. Come on. l'll put a rope up. That'll make it easier. Did you know your father had a lover? No. A man. Have you already eaten? - Lasagna at Liliane's. l'll be in the workshop. l thought we'd arranged to meet this evening. Look, Patrick. l don't know what you've been doing all day, looking for that hammer or whatever, but l can tell you now it won't bring your father back. You are going through an existential phase caused by your father's death. And that manifests itself in your search for that stupid hammer of yours. l am your distraction, Patrick. Not that hammer. Let it go, eh? Let Herman look after the campsite. Then everything can go back to being like it was. Come on, Patrick. Eh? Then l'll rub you in again. l'm just trying to find my hammer, Liliane. You won't get your father back that way, Patrick. l really do feel bad about your hammer. lf l'd known it was yours... Are you worried they'll blow away? - lt's for my mother. May l see? Patrick. lt's really nice here. Who does the furniture belong to? To me. Did you make those? Yes. Who for? For myself. They're beautiful. Can l buy a chair off you? Yes, but you don't need to pay for it. - Of course l do. Did you train to do this? No. l just tinker a bit. That's not true, Patrick. You're really talented. l know someone who sells designer furniture in Brussels. lf they were to see what you... And you sleep here too? lt's handy. Do you think you'll find it? l don't know. Patrick? My condolences, pal. Did you see my hammer on the tree trunk? No. But l'll keep my eyes open. Hi. You don't happen to have seen my hammer lying there? No. What about Gunter? He's often on the veranda. Maybe he saw something? No. Gunter's in Brussels. Do you know what he's gone to do? He's with his friend from Switzerland. l knew you enjoyed your food. All those jars of jam Liliane makes specially for you, eh darling? Right. l'm going to start on the dessert. ls everything going OK with the campsite? Yeah? Have you given any thought to what you want to do with it? Rudy has left us with lots of questions and uncertainties, of course. But what l'm most concerned about today is Patrick. Believe it or not, but l'm thinking of Patrick and imagining l'm Patrick. Then l close my eyes... l'm sitting there on the sofa, for example, then l close my eyes and l become Patrick. Then l think exactly how Patrick thinks. Then l see everything that's going on in that head. Matters of vital importance, too many to mention, but one question keeps reoccurring. Can l cope with running the campsite? Yes? No? And do l want to? That's the second question. Because now we're getting to the heart of the matter. Does Patrick want this? l don't think this will make Patrick happy. Yeah, l think... l think... - l understand. l understand. Of course l understand. How shall l put it? lt's a deadlock. l'm familiar with the conflicting feelings fighting each other inside you. And l want to help you. l want to take that weight off your shoulders. Let me just tell you what l mean. l want to buy the campsite. l can't do anything about that. - Don't give me an answer yet. That's not necessary. l realise you want to think about it. l know the campsite has always belonged to your family. Right. Guys, look. -Yeah. l hope it's OK. There you are. l'm not hungry anymore. - Nothing has to change for you, Patrick. You can carry on living here and we don't need to charge you rent. No, of course not. Everything just stays as it is. Of course. l think it's best if you don't say anything to Nelly for now. Because it's about you, of course. Eh? That's too big. Patrick, are you OK? They used my hammer. -What? They broke in. -Why? The money has been stolen from the till. The money has been stolen from the till? People cross the border, commit three or four burglaries and then cross back over the border again. There have already been a number this year. Perhaps l'm getting old but it seems to happen more and more as the years go by. They used my hammer. l don't think so, Patrick. Most of the time these people bring their own tools. Their own screwdriver, their own crowbar, their own hammer. Sometimes even their own shoehorn. They used... my hammer. And they injured themself. People, we all know that since Rudy died our beloved campsite has gone downhill fast. And l think we should be honest about that. Yeah? lt's all down to an uncertain void that has been created. And a lack of leadership on the site after Rudy's death. Hold on, hold on, hold on. Wilfried, we're not here to start pointing fingers at people. lt isn't easy, of course. lt isn't all black and white, of course. And that is why l, and my wife too, have the deepest respect for Patrick's feelings and the mourning process he is going through at present. But, at the same time... At the same time l have realised that our summers are at risk. l don't need to tell anyone here what worrying things have happened on our beloved site today. Not that long ago we were told here in this room that there was no money in the till. Yesterday we heard, as if by magic, that the contents of the till had been stolen. l'm assuming there actually were contents. And if that is the case, then l'm wondering what's going on. Are we being lied to on purpose? lf so, people, we have reached a certain limit. We are entitled to clarity. lt is our campsite. lt is our money. And it is our future. Which is why my wife and l, after careful consideration, thought we would put a very personal proposal... You really think they agreed? -Yes. Really? -Yes, you saw so too. They applauded you. That's what you wanted, isn't it? Eh? Yes. But l saw Jos?e and... and Sabrina looking. l thought, ''Well...'' They don't understand what it's all about but... you made some very good points and finally told it as it is for once. l really can't believe we're actually doing this, Lil. No. We are doing it. l'm exhausted. Go to bed then, eh? -Yeah. Shall l run a bath? Do you know how much l love you, Lil? Lil? Do you know how happy you make me when l see that look in your eyes? And l know l can still... make you feel so proud. Herman. Herman. - Liliane. You've been drinking. Go and... - My Lil. Yeah. Come on, let's run a bath, darling. Eh? Shall l run a bath? Eh? What? What's the matter? Liliane. Sorry. l just needed to lie down for a bit. Did you hear what that Herman was saying? Don't let them push you around like that. What do you think of Dustin? l've given up my life for that guy. Did you know l studied law? And now... lt will get better, eh? - Do you think so? We're the same, Patrick. We have to learn to stand up for ourselves. You've got far too much talent. To allow it to go to waste for... for those idiots. Herman. - Hi. Hello, Herman. Herman. Hello. - Herman. Herman. Wilfried. - Herman. Well. lt's a lovely day, isn't it? - Certainly is. Jos?e, hi. - Herman. Hello. - Hi. Well? - l've removed it all... Lil. -Yes. Who is it? - lt's Patrick. Oh. Just the man l need. Come in, Patrick. - No, thank you. lf you give me my hammer back l won't tell anyone what you did. l haven't got your hammer. Your blood is on the door, Herman. -What? You forced the door with my hammer and hurt your hand and then you stole that money to show l can't do it but l can do it. And l also know how things stand. -You're giving me the creeps. You think l stole that money? -And my hammer. Why would l do that? You think l stole that money so everyone can see you can't run the campsite. Come in. - Give it back. l just burned my hand on the oven, Patrick. l'd baked a chocolate cake. l used some of that delicious apricot jam too. There's some left... -You're lying, Herman. You're lying. You're lying. Where is my hammer? - Patrick... Have you gone crazy? Has a fuse blown in that head of yours? Have you got any idea... how strange you are? l don't have to do anything to show you can't cope with the campsite, do l? You're doing that all by yourself. Even your father knew you were unfit to do it. Did you think he wasn't ashamed of you, Patrick? A son who's still living at home aged 40, a flabby... lazy guy with no ambition? What do you do all day, Patrick? Thirty... Thirty... What did you say, Patrick? -Thirty-eight. Not forty. People like you are the reason why the world is such a fucking mess and l feel like puking when l look at you. Stop. Stop it, stop it. Stop it. Stop it. Stop. Fuck. Fuck. Fucking hell. Fucking hell. Fucking hell. l'm going to stick your head down the toilet. Down the toilet, you fat bastard. Fucking hell. That's enough now! Let go of him. Get in there. - Let go. Herman. Let go. Patrick. l've got it. Patrick. l've found your hammer. He was planning to leave with the money and everything. l thought he'd been acting strangely for a while. l followed him... and was just able to stop him. l beat it all out of him. Go on. Didn't l say l'd make it up to you? l took the money out of the till. He'd promised me. Your father, he'd promised me. We were going to start again together. We were going to be happy together. Rudy. Did you use my hammer? What did you say? Did you use my hammer? Yes, l used your hammer. Where is it now? l just... l put it back where l found it. There you are, there it is. That's not my hammer. -Well... Yeah. Patrick. Patrick. l told him he could keep the money. l'm leaving for Brussels tomorrow with Stephanie, after the funeral. Are you shaking your head? For how long? -Two weeks. And if l like it, l'll stay for longer. What about me? Son, you're not a little kid anymore, are you? What is all this? Do whatever you feel like doing, eh? The campsite belonged to your father. Now it belongs to you. Do whatever you want with it. Sell it, build apartments on it, blow it up. l couldn't care less. Did you find your hammer, Patrick? No. Did you give up looking for it? Maybe you should give up looking for it. Maybe that's how you'll find it. Let me tell you something, Patrick. When l started, all l wanted was success. l worked so hard. l would have killed for it. But it never came. Never came. Until one day... l just let it go. Gave up on it. Just like that, l thought, ''Who needs to be famous?'' You have to sign here. - Hm? Oh, let's see then. l thought, ''Who needs to be famous? That's bullshit. lt means nothing. lt's not about you, it's about what they think of you.'' That's what l thought. Who needs ambition? What good does it do you? Hm? Ambition is a virus from your brain that eats your heart. And as soon as l had that thought... it just started happening. Fame, success, girls, album deals. All the things l'd wanted but much much bigger than l had ever dreamed of. And that's how it works, man. Sometimes, to get what you want, you have to not want what you want. Think about it. Don't worry. lt's just procedure. These men do things their way but l asked them to wait outside because l needed to have a bit of a chat with Patrick first. That's it. Hold on, hold on, hold on. Before you say that, listen to me first and then, importantly, say nothing. These men found this hammer in Brussels, next to a body. lt would seem this hammer smashed someone's skull in. A Swiss guy's. lt's my hammer. - No. They made inquiries and discovered this model was no longer made. Worse, this model was no longer in circulation. They went from the manufacturer to the distributor to the shop in the village. And what did they learn in that shop? That Patrick's hammer had disappeared. The same model. l thought, ''l know Patrick. l'll go and have a chat with him.'' lt's definitely not Patrick's hammer. - lt is, it's mine. lt can't be Patrick's hammer because if it is, Patrick is going to be in trouble. lf it is Patrick's hammer l will be obliged by law to put Patrick in prison for several days as a precaution while they find out who did it. Understand? lt's my hammer. l'm explaining to you why it can't be your hammer, Patrick. You will go to prison. lt's sorted. lt's not his hammer. He's never seen it before. ls that your hammer, sir? Patrick? Does this hammer belong to you? Yes. Patrick. l know you don't want a lawyer but... l can't just sit here and watch. Apparently no one at the campsite saw you at the time the murder occurred. They've worked out that you had plenty of time to drive to Brussels and back. Why are you doing this to yourself? l know you didn't do it. Patrick? lt's as if we are all trying something out... while you are just... being yourself. And... that is beautiful to see, Patrick. They've arrested the person who did it. lt was Gunter, Florence's son. He took your hammer, he took it to Brussels. He's admitted everything. Oh, that's great news. - Can l talk to you, Patrick? Patrick. You'll never see your hammer again. PATRlCK
