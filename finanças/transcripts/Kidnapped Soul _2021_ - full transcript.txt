Chi-Kai. It feels strange here. Don't be ridiculous. Just do your job. Junior. Why did you shout so loudly? Did you see a ghost in your dream? Don't be ridiculous. Dou-Dou. Go sit down, Dou-Dou. Miss. Lu. Teacher Lee. Join us in the community activities when you are free. I'm still packing. I'm very busy. Let's catch up some other day, okay? - Okay. - Sorry. Have a good night. I have told you so many times to not open the door for strangers. If you don't listen to me, we are not going to the amusement park. According to the crime scene report, the girl died about ten days ago. But the day of her death may not be the same day the body was abandoned. We still need to wait for the final forensic report for more details. - The Captain's here. - Captain. Why? In my absence, the team has become so relaxed. Hand me the report. Captain. Sir. At the crime scene, we saw... Is this linked to the missing child cases? We checked the northern region in the past year. No linked case yet. The results from the last two cases will be out soon. Chiang. You are in-charge of this. Remember to get it done fast! Yes, sir. I sure will. Have you interrogated everyone? I asked everywhere and there are no clues at all. Chi-Kai, I'm thinking, since we don't have any leads, let's ask my auntie for help? Just give it a try. Maybe we can get some leads. It's better than sitting here and doing nothing. Come on, let's go. I'm calling my auntie now. She had a lot of injuries. Before her death, she was unable to speak for a long time. The place she was locked up, has a stairway, going up, there is some... a slide and a swing... It is very remote... Very quiet... Auntie... Master. Did she mention anything? Like her name, a birthday? Or where she lives? Why don't you ask her who killed her? That will be a lot easier for the police. It's getting blurry. You must act fast. There's not much time left. Please Here's a clue for you. Auntie, please forgive Chi-Kai. He is a straight-talker. Please excuse his behavior. Take good care of your child. Don't lose sight of her. Thanks for your concern. But I'm still single. Excuse me. Goodbye, Auntie. Goodbye, Ah-Di. Take care! But I think this is really difficult. The airplane. Get that airplane. - Let me eat it. - No way. This is cool. It'll do. This is pretty strong, too. What are you doing? Why are you here? I'm here to repair my mobile phone. It's broken? Yeah. Why? I'm not telling you. Brother Shan, I want to repair my mobile phone. What's wrong? Let me have a look. My mom was using her phone when she was in the toilet, and she accidently dropped it into the toilet bowl. Just leave it right there. I'll check it later. My mom wiped it and sprayed a lot of perfume. You can smell it... Just leave it there. Why don't you play with them? Okay. - Can I have a drink? - Sure. Ah-De. Where are the batteries you borrowed this morning? In the... - In what? - The drawer under the counter. Oh, no. What should I do? Let me see. You see that? - Am I nice to you? - Yes. Good girl. Mommy, can I play with the doggie? Doggie? Okay, fine. But don't go too far. I'll finish my work in a minute, okay? Come here, doggie. I want to take pictures of you. Where're you going? Don't go. Doggie. Dou-Dou. Dou-Dou. Where are you? Stop playing with me. Dou-Dou. Dou-Dou! Dou-Dou. Dou-Dou. Dou-Dou. Dou-Dou. Dou-Dou! Hello. Do you wanna see your child? Dou-Dou! Dou-Dou! Mommy! Mommy! How do you feel seeing your daughter this way? Do you feel the pain? How much money do you want? I don't have much. But... I'll find some way to raise the money. You are just an elementary school teacher. Why would I want your money? Then what do you want? The countdown has started. Look at your daughter. There is no need to talk further. This is your only choice. Think carefully about what you did to me a year ago. It doesn't matter if you can't remember. You can watch her die slowly. I'll call you again. Captain. Captain, please review this file. The girl is about seven-years-old. There are traces of chronic abuse. Sir. Excuse me, I need to take this call. Sir. The girl had bruises all over her body. Sis. Hello, Chi-Kai. Sis, what happened? Dou-Dou was kidnapped. I'll be right there. Okay. What happened, Chi-Kai? Something's happened to Dou-Dou. Come over when you finish. No way. Auntie was right. Sis. Chi-Kai. It's okay. Start by telling me what happened to Dou-Dou. Mommy! Mommy! How do you feel seeing your daughter this way? Do you feel the pain? I already lost my husband. I can't lose Dou-Dou, too. Sis. Dou-Dou should be safe for now. At the moment, we have have to follow his instructions. For Dou-Dou's safety, okay? I'll get the door. Sis. Sister Mei-Jen. Can I have your cellphone, please? Okay. Okay. Thanks. The Captain doesn't know, right? He doesn't. No one followed you? No. I'm here by myself. Jia-Chiang. If you find any clues on the video, please tell me immediately. Okay. No problem. Sis. Let him stay here and work while I go check the school. Be careful. Don't worry. I want to see the school corridor again. Okay. Doggie. Please rewind and play it back again. Doggie. - Stop here. - Okay. - Can you zoom in? - Sure. No other people. Are there any other angles to look at after the corridor ends? Those cameras are broken. Let me see the front entrance again. Okay. Stop right here. Zoom in. He was definitely avoiding the security camera. - Re-play again. - Okay. Excuse me. I'm Lee Chi-Kai from the police force. Anything I can help with? I would like to ask you a question. Do you know the white truck parked at the school gate today? White truck... You mean that one over there? That's not from the stores nearby. We presumed it was making a delivery at the school. But it didn't. I have never seen that truck before. It is very strange... Why was it strange? 'Cause if they are making a delivery to the school, they can just drive into the school. Not park outside the front entrance. So I think it's strange, yeah. - Thank you for your cooperation. - It's all good. - Thank you. - No problem. Excuse me. Who's the person in charge? He's inside. - Excuse me. - Yes? Lee Chi-Kai from the criminal team. I would like to ask you something. This truck should belong to you. Who's the driver? Right. It's ours. Number 2433... wait a minute. Mommy. Mommy. Mommy. Mommy. Here's some old information that might help. Last October, we moved out from Lu-Guang New Town. Then we moved to Jing-Long Community in April. Last week we moved here. It's mine. Jia-Chiang. Run a background check for me. His name is Huang Ming-Cheng. The ID number is A122407608. Got it. Huang Ming-Cheng, Age 36. No criminal record. Wait a minute. November 10th, last year. His only daughter disappeared from home. Lu-Guang New Town, New Taipei City. She hasn't been found yet. November 10th, last year. I was also moving out of Lu-Guang New Town. Chi-Kai. Was it him? Did he kidnap Dou-Dou? We can't be sure at the moment. If it is Huang Ming-Cheng who kidnapped Dou-Dou... Tomorrow is the one year anniversary of his daughter's disappearance. And you were moving at this exact same time last year when his daughter disappeared. This is too coincidental. But if Huang Ming-Cheng kidnapped Dou-Dou, then based on what I've found so far, the clues seem too simple. He's too easy to find. Don't you find that strange? Never mind. I'll go to his house to have a look. Sister Mei-Jen. Do you remember this man? I remember that he lived in the same building. I think his daughter was attending our school, too. - Are you hungry? - Not counted. - What do you want to eat? - Why not? - Not counted. - I don't know. You can't play this way. Sorry. Three to zero. Three to zero. Jia-Chiang. "You should know who I am by now." Hi, I'm Lee Chi-Kai from the criminal team. Please come in. Mr. Huang likes to do triathlons? It's quite popular these days. Is he at home? Are you investigating or doing a household survey? Mrs. Huang. Here's the thing. Regarding the disappearance of your daughter last year, the DNA matching results are still inconclusive. So I'm here to help. I'd like to know... I thought the police had given up on looking for my daughter. No. We did not give up. Waiting on tenterhooks... How long can you endure this? It's been a whole year. No one called for a ransom. And there were no updates from the police to claim the body. My daughter vanished... just like that. Mrs. Huang. I understand how you feel. Impossible. How could you think that you understand the way I feel? Dead or alive, I... I'd rather know the truth about Peng-Peng's whereabouts. No matter what happened. Every single day, I'm afraid of falling asleep. Because I don't know what I will lose the next time I wake up. Peng-Peng. Why didn't you switch off the TV after you were done? Peng-Peng. Peng-Peng. Peng-Peng! Don't scare mommy, Peng-Peng. Peng-Peng! Excuse me. Excuse me. Have you seen this girl? Mrs. Huang. Have you seen Peng-Peng? - What happened? - Peng-Peng's missing. I don't know why Peng-Peng would disappear just like that. The door lock wasn't tampered with. None of our neighbors saw her. She did not go out to play with the other kids. And neither did the security cameras show anyone suspicious. But I believe Peng-Peng was definitely kidnapped by someone. Is this clear enough? Is there anything else you would like to know? Thanks for your cooperation. I'm home, honey. Are you okay? The police was here. They have news on our daughter? I wouldn't be like this if they did. Why are you so late? Is everything okay? Fine. Just... there was a delay, but everything's fine. Here. Here. Look. Our family hasn't been together for a long time. Let's celebrate Peng-Peng's birthday, okay? Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Love lies coldly In the embrace of time In the silence before drop scene What's the hindrances? Watching love walk away In the deathbed confession, What last words should write? The fading love Living in the last hug Without any trace of regret. Just like the sky thanks For the birds once appeared. Fading love Forgive me for letting you go One day When the time reconciled harm and victimization The leaving one will return When he/she goes far enough Wait for one more flower blooms on the other side And I may catch you Untie the pain Love brings away the clouds I am willing to stay To find our remains For the fading love Don't run. Go after him. Stop! Don't run! Chi-Kai. Don't run. Don't run. Don't run. What do you want to do? Get down! Officer Lee. There's still 29 hours left. Take it easy. So it is you who fucking kidnapped Dou-Dou. What do you want? What do I want? What about my daughter? It's been a year. What did you give me? What did you do? Isn't the police supposed to protect us? If you can't protect us, then where's the justice? You police officers choose the big cases to increase your credibility. My daughter's disappearance was no big deal, right? I'll make you experience the pain of losing your child. Please come down. We can bring the criminal to justice together. You think I can still trust you? It's been a year. This time, I have no choice. Please trust me. I guarantee it with my life. Then I hope you will succeed this time. My love, when you read this letter, I would have left already. The past one year, you blamed yourself for Peng-Peng's disappearance. Seeing you become so fragile, I didn't know how to comfort you. I'm so sorry. I have been diagnosed with cancer. There's not much time left for me now. Forgive my selfish decision. I think I must sacrifice myself to get the attention of the police and the public. In order for them to solve the case quickly. To give you and my dearest daughter some closure. I will love you in my next life. Your husband. Who are the family members of Huang Ming-Cheng? Me. Me. I'm his wife. The patient had stopped breathing and had no heartbeat on arriving. Emergency rescue has been unsuccessful after two hours of persisting. I'm sorry. Sir. I think we should solve the missing child case first. Chi-Kai. Can the case, assigned by the Superior, be handled first? I know you worked very hard on this. An unsolved case from a year ago. It'll affect our performance if we are too persistent. Okay? Come on. Yes, sir. Have you ever thought about how heartbreaking it is for a father to lose his daughter? Isn't the police supposed to protect us? If you can't protect us, then where's the justice? What exactly did you do? Sis. Where's Dou-Dou? There's no news yet. Is Huang Ming-Cheng really dead? My love. How could you do this to me? That's his wife. Where's my daughter? Your husband kidnapped my daughter. You should know where she is, right? Tell me. Tell me. Tell me. I'll kill you! I'll kill you! Sis Mei-Jen. Stop. Tell me where my daughter is. Sis Mei-Chen, please stop. Tell me where my daughter is. My Dou-Dou. What have I done? Why are you hurting me like this? I beg you. Please tell me where my daughter is. I beg you. I beg you... I beg you. Please let me know where she is, okay? I beg you. Please tell me... Please. Please tell me where my daughter is. It was you. It was because of you. Every time I open my eyes, the first thing that appears in my mind is how my daughter disappeared. Do you understand now? Thank you for your cooperation, Mrs. Huang. "Peng-Peng Happy Birthday!" Jia-Chiang. Take my sister with you and meet me at your aunt's place. Sis. Chi-Kai. - Let's go! - Go. Chi-Kai, I got the report. It's Huang Yi-Peng. Let's go! Master. I didn't believe in spirits before. If I offended you before, please accept my apology. I want to save my sister's daughter. But only Huang Ming-Cheng knows where Dou-Dou is. Master, I beg you for your help. Please. Master. My husband left me. My daughter Dou-Dou is all I have. She is my life. I can't lose her. I want her back no matter what it takes. Please save my daughter, master. Auntie, please help them. Cause and effect. Cause and effect. Where there's a cause, there will be an effect. Huang Ming-Cheng died in anger. There isn't much time left. You must seize the opportunity. There is a time for everything. I will do what I can and leave the rest to fate. Sis. Why can't I move? Do you know who I am? How could I forget? You caused the disappearance of my daughter. Huang Ming-Cheng. I didn't do anything. Sis Mei-Jen. I didn't do anything. I don't even know you. This is a mistake. Please tell me where my daughter is. Please let her go. I beg you. Teacher Lee. What kind of teacher are you? You never do your homework? How can I help you like this? You want me to think back to what I did a year ago. I was moving when your daughter was kidnapped. We lived in the same building. We were neighbors. But we didn't know each other. Is this a misunderstanding? What misunderstanding? Think it over. Who did you talk to that day? Who did you meet? Can you start thinking from there? I thought you wanted to help mommy pack up. I am helping. You are? Only one box after so long? Keep going. More. Okay. Stop. It's yours. Put it in. Hello, I'm Mr. Huang from the fifth floor. I forgot my keys, so... That day, except for when the workers came in and out, I remember you used the intercom, ask me to open the door for you. I did help you, didn't I? I wish that was me. So that wasn't you. That was the kidnapper. He kidnapped your daughter. Did you check the security cameras? Maybe you can see his face. It was your movers' truck that blocked the security camera, you know? I'm sorry. I know what I have done now. But I didn't do it on purpose. Can you please forgive me? Lee Chi-Kai. Do you finally realize what's going on? Mr. Huang. I will keep my promise to you. But my sister didn't do it on purpose. She didn't know that wasn't you on the intercom. It was her carelessness that destroyed my family, you know? You just want me die, right? I'm willing to give away my life for Dou-Dou. Calm down. Sis Mei-Jen, don't be impulsive. Mr. Huang. She is not the one who killed your daughter. Every injustice has its perpetrator. If you wish to seek revenge, you should find the real murderer! My daughter... My daughter's dead. My daughter's dead. Hello. Who is it? Hi, I am Lo Jia-Chiang from the police. I need your assistance with an investigation. I am busy. It won't take too long. There was someone who lived here named Huang Ming-Cheng. His daughter went missing about a year ago. We would like to... My turn. My turn. Go. Go. We don't know him. Let's play somewhere else. Ah-Shan, you're here. Mei-Jen. I thought it was San. Come in. Come in. Long time no see. What brings you here? Wait, don't take your shoes off. Come right in. Just come inside. Here. Here. Mei-Jen, it's been a long time. Do you know that my daughter Elly is in her first year of junior high now. I know. She came by the school to see me few weeks ago. Really? She didn't tell me. I remember... you didn't stay long in our neighborhood. Many other neighbors moved, too. I can't find anyone I can chit chat anymore. It is so boring. This is... Hi, I am Lo Jia-Chiang from the police. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. You are the officer in-charge of our neighborhood? We have such a good-looking officer in our area? Thank you for your comment. We are here today to ask you something. It's from about one year ago. There was a disappearance in your community. Do you remember anything about that? Did you see anything suspicious? How rude of me. You are here after so long and I didn't even offer you a glass of water. I'll get some drinks. Make yourself comfortable. I'll get it. It's okay, Mrs. Lin. Don't bother. It's nothing. Please sit. Sis Mei-Jen. Do you think Mrs. Lin... Mei-Jen. Is someone ringing the bell? Can you check to see who it is for me, please? Okay. Hello. I'm Ah-Shan. I'm here to fix the computer. Please open the door. I'm Mr. Huang from fifth floor. I forgot my keys. I'm Mr. Huang from fifth floor. I forgot my keys... I'm here to fix the computer. I'm here to fix the computer. Where are you taking those things? I'm here to fix the computer. I'm Mr. Huang from fifth floor. Please open the door. Mrs. Lin. Mrs. Lin? Calling me "Mrs. Lin" makes me feel so old. Call me Chanel. Where should I leave my shoes? Don't take it off. Just come in. Come on. You were busy out there, aren't you? Not really. Are you thirsty? I'll get you a drink. I'll have some water. Sorry, Mei-Jen. He's here to fix the computer. Please sit for a while. Ah-Shan, listen. It's my husband's computer in this study. You know what, it takes forever to start my computer. Slow as a snail, you know? Extremely slow to boot up. Jia-Chiang. He sounded like the person on the intercom that day who asked me to open the door for him. And you know what? It's takes forever to upload pictures. You sure? Pretty sure. Think again. Review the details. In the time it takes to upload one picture, I can finish playing a round of Mahjong. Officer Lo. About Mr. Huang's daughter. You can ask Ah-Shan. Because he's the one who fixes all the computers in this community. He knows us well and the kids, too. - Really? - Ask him. Ask him. Okay. Hello, I am Lo Jia-Chiang from the police. Hello. I would like to ask you about an incident from one year ago. A little girl disappeared in this neighborhood. Do you remember anything about this? One year ago? It's hard to remember right away... But I need to go to another client's place after this. I think maybe... I can give you my contact details. Because I have to go... Wait, it's okay. You can contact me, Officer Lo. Thank you. I need to finish this first because there's another client to visit. Excuse me. Yes, Chi-Kai. Number 201, Lu-Kuang Rd. is a game repair shop. There's an ex-convict for sexual harassment who lives there. Kids usually play in that area. I'll send you the files. Here's the clue for you. My phone has been acting strange lately. It's lagging a little. Like this. "Suen Rung-De, accused of sexual harassment in September 2018" "Was declared guilty in the first instance," "and the appeal is currently in the second instance." It's not a big issue. Let me go inside and get you some spare parts. Don't run! Don't run. Don't run. Don't you dare run away again. Stop! Why did you run? What do you want? Freeze! Hey! Why were you running? Where were you on November 10th last year? I was abroad. You better tell me the truth. It is the truth. What? What? - What are you doing? - What are you doing? I want to show you my phone to prove that I'm innocent. Get up. - You better be telling the truth. - Get up. Check this. You'll be dead if you are lying. You heard that. You'll be dead if you are lying. Even if it is the truth, you police can still arrest people for no reason. These are all excuses. Why did you run? You chased me, so I ran. You ran, and that's why I chased you. Arrest him. Chi-Kai, it's not him. Give me my phone back. Can I leave now? Wait. Are there other people who work in your shop? Just me and my boss. Is your boss Ah-Shan? Don't the police need to apologize for arresting the wrong person? What the... Chi-Kai, forget it. Got it. It says that he was abandoned as a young boy. His name is Wu San-Fong. Grew up in a nursery. The records state that he was a loner as a child and was bullied by others in the nursery. Is it him? Did he kidnap Dou-Dou? What if we've got the wrong person? Wu San-Fong. Why are you always holding that doll? Are you a girl? Right. Only girls talk to dolls. Can't you see? He is a girl. Say it again. Teacher. Wu San-Fong is beating someone. You shouldn't strangle the others. What if something goes wrong? Give me your hand. Is he planning to run away? I'll follow him. Jia-Chiang, go inside now. See what you can find in there. Get off. Okay. Okay. Master, Can you... hang in there? Huang Ming-Cheng. Don't you want to tell us where Lee Mei-Jen's daughter is? They went to arrest the murderer for me. I want to stay here and wait for them. What if they can't catch him? Do you know if you kill a child in your life, you will go to hell. It is so remote here. Sis. Stay here and wait for backup. I'll go up there to check it out. Okay. Be careful. Okay. Don't move! Put your hands up. Police? Put that down. Let go. Let go. I unlocked the file. Look. Chi-Kai. Chi-Kai, wake up. Chi-Kai. Here. Girl. Girl. Girl. Yun. Yun. We are going to move you to a new house. What? It's okay. We'll find a better place. Let's go. We'll leave after lunch. Girl. Don't be afraid. I'm here to save you. Girl, it's okay. Come to me. Girl. Stay away. You stay away. You stay away. Stay away. You stay away. Yun, come here. Why did you become a bad girl? It's all your fault. Watch the time. Be careful. Be careful. Careful. Careful. Careful. Mrs. Huang. We feel sorry for Mr. Huang. There was a corpse found in a suitcase a few days ago. After the medical examination, we found that it was your daughter. A suspect has been arrested for murder. He's the owner of a computer repair shop in your neighborhood. Peng-Peng. According to the neighbors, this person was usually very friendly. He services the computers - in the entire neighborhood. - Brother San. The kids know him well. Maybe that's why no one was suspicious of him. And he found the chance to kidnap your daughter. Mrs. Huang. Here's some documents you need to verify. Inside this envelope is the DNA identification report and some pictures taken at the crime scene. These are the clothes she had on when she was found. Please verify everything and sign here for me. Take your time. Chi-Kai, go faster. Take a look. You know the truth now. This is the master's body. This is the first time she broke the vows to use her body for possession. She said you're not evil. She can't bear to see your soul in hell. Can I see my daughter again? Can I? Huang Ming-Cheng. Your time together has come to an end. You should just let it go. Huang Ming-Cheng! Huang Ming-Cheng. Huang Ming-Cheng. Huang Ming-Cheng. I caught the murderer who kidnapped your daughter. It's him. Now you can tell me where my daughter is. I am Bai-Shi. Huang Ming-Cheng. We made a deal, didn't we? Tell me where my daughter is, okay? Huang Ming-Cheng's gone. Sis Mei-Jen. Huang Ming-Cheng's not here. Really. Why did you let him leave? Master. He kept his promise. He left a clue for you. He left it with you. Sis. "No. 49, Daiyuku, Dalin Vil.," "Pinglin Dist., New Taipei City" "See you upstairs." Chi-Kai, drive faster. You sure she's here? Upstairs. Sis. She should be right there. - Watch him. - Okay. Be careful. - Dou-Dou! - Dou-Dou! Dou-Dou! - Dou-Dou! - Dou-Dou! Dou-Dou! Dou-Dou! Dou-Dou! - Dou-Dou! - Dou-Dou! Dou-Dou! Dou-Dou! Let me. Dou-Dou. Dou-Dou. Dou-Dou. Sis, that's a doll. Dou-Dou is not in there. Sis. Sis, listen. Is that Dou-Dou? Dou-Dou. Dou-Dou! What is taking them so long? - Dou-Dou. - Dou-Dou. Dou-Dou. Sis, untie her first. Dou-Dou. Are you okay? Dou-Dou? - Lift her up. - Okay. Here. Careful. Dou-Dou. Dou-Dou. Dou-Dou. Dou-Dou. Wake up, Dou-Dou. Dou-Dou. Dou-Dou. Dou-Dou, wake up. - Dou-Dou. - Dou-Dou. Sis, let me call an ambulance. Dou-Dou. Dou-Dou. Don't leave me. Don't leave mommy. Mommy. Dou-Dou. Dou-Dou. Mommy. Yes? I'm hungry. You're hungry? When can we go to a restaurant? Okay, we can go to a restaurant now. Okay? Uncle will take you to the restaurant right away. Okay. Sis, stay down. Hide there. Come. You, go! Go! Jia-Chiang. What do you want? If you're so capable, why didn't you find my daughter a year ago? First, calm down. Calm down. Put the gun down. Don't do this. Let the law punish him. There's no meaning in doing this. That's because you have no idea what kind of suffering I am going through. Today is my saddest day. I know Peng-Peng's dead. But I didn't know she died so pitifully. I endured it until now to let you know what justice really is! Let's leave here together, okay? Even if you kill him. You can't bring your daughter back to life. You are pointing the gun at someone who doesn't want to live anymore. You think it matters? He made everyday a living hell for me. Why can't I kill him? Here. Cheers. Aren't we good friends? We've known each other for so long. Why don't you eat the food I give you? I'll feel bad this way, you know? I took a huge risk and put in so much effort to bring you back and protect you. But you don't eat the food I gave you. And you don't let me dress you up. You are not a good girl, you know? If you don't listen to me, I don't want you anymore. Mommy, where're you going? Mommy's not going anywhere. Mommy will always be with you. Where's uncle? Uncle will take the day off and take you to the restaurant tomorrow, okay? Okay. Good girl. - Take good care of them. - No problem. I'll go hospital with Dou-Dou first. I'll meet you after work. There's something I still can't figure out. How did Huang Ming-Cheng know that your sister opened the door? That's a good question. I don't know, either. Master. I want to know how my daughter disappeared. That day, the woman who was moving out accidentally opened the door downstairs. She says, a woman who was moving accidentally opened the door. So the bad guy got in. Who? Do I know her? She didn't say. I... I missed her so much. Okay. Okay. You may leave.
