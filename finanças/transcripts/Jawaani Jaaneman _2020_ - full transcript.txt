"When I see your grace, my heart says.." "Ole-Ole.." "Your style is totally unique.." "My heart says.." "Ole-Ole.." "I get tempted by the young girls.." "And those who like to have fun."

Wait. Where are you? Coming. The meeting is inside your complex, at least be on time here. Coming, coming. Relax He's coming. What are you doing, Jassi? - Sorry, Sorry brother. How do you like the place? Unbelievable, Jazz. It's a top-class location you've found. I've been to your place so many times.. ..but never saw it from this point of you. We can create a building complex here. I admit you've an eye for good things. A bad one.. Let's talk about the property. No one knows that the owners are ready to sell. Once the word gets out on the market.. ..buyers will flock to this place. Only If the word gets out. We like her. You've a deal. Come I'll give the token. Oh, man.. What a car. What's the mileage? It's electric. Once we crack this deal, Jazz.. ..you can buy a dozen like this. When are we meeting with the investors? Oh, man.. Yeah, you like it? Looks just like a basket of muffins. I was talking about your hair, Jazz. When you see such a beautiful thing in the mirror.. ..who wants to look at himself. Next time should we try highlights? Highlights look best only in cricket. I like to play the entire innings. Bad joke. What is the plan for Diwali? Not mine. But the family does, with me. Of dinner. Same old praying and worshipping. What are your plans? Working. Diwali is a good time for business. And Happy Diwali. Happy Diwali. Happy Diwali my firecrackers. Happy Diwali, Jazz. From one firecracker to another. Shall we? So how is business? Business is great, dad. There is a new deal. Hopefully Jassi will spare some time for work as well. You see, bro.. ..I measure time in quality and not quantity. I take only four hours to do an entire day's work. When have you ever been in the office for four hours? He wakes up at 12, comes to office at 3.. ..and leaves at 5. Are you my partner or warden. Brother.. Juliet, pay attention to your Romeo. He's always chasing me. Jassi, you should come to see us more oftenthan just on Sundays. I am working late night now a days. - Are you ever going to change? - Next year. Pass me that. I am thinking of taking a sabbatical. A-year-long vacation. 5-star hotel, butler, healthy food, jacuzzi. No phone calls, no work, no restrictions on sleeping or waking up. Just me and my freedom. Young man like you should plan marriage, kids.. Not think about holidaying. Young man? Dad, I don't want wife and kids.. I've said that before. I wonder what's the hurry? Pammi's son is gay. So? No, they've been coaxing him to get married for so long. Recently they argued and he confessed.. I am gay. Ohh.. so now you all know. Jassi! No, mom, I am not gay. And what is the problem even if I was. He can't be gay, mom. And I can vouch for him. Now that's like my bro.. Enough bro.. Jassi.. ..this deal is very important. Pay attention. Don't worry. We're two hearts but one soul. We're not two hearts.. ..you are a dil-do. One of the best developers of the city, The Grover Group.. ..wants to invest in Hounslow. And they have chosen this property for the development. I was only 18 when I joined this business.. ..and in my 15-years-of experience, I've never seen an offer like this. We all know that your homes are worth 200,000 pounds. And their offer is 300,000 pounds. This offer alone answers all your questions.. ..but if you still have any queries.. I am right here. Jazz, you know we've been looking for a developer. Let's begin the paperwork Agreement is not the issue.. what about Mrs. Malika. look, this deal is valid only if all the owners agree. Else, the project will never get approved. We've tried convincing her, but she pays no heed. She owns three apartments. You live in one of them. She is a very stubborn lady. If you guys are ready to sell.. ..then convincing her is my job. - Okay.. - Okay.. You have committed but will you be able to convince Mrs. Malika? I'll have to pay the rent first and try convincing her. You haven't paid your rent yet. What do you do with all your money? Rocky. Buddy.. My rocket. I am just a rocket, but you're surrounded by firecrackers. Ladies, meet my brother from another mother. My twin, Jazz. - Hi, Jazz. - Hi.. Hello. Let's get a selfie. Sure, come on. I'll do it for you. Now that's what you call life. This is called flying solo. You're cute too. I love the colour of your hair. Which dye do you use? You're kidding, right. It's all-natural, babe.. Ohh..doesn't seem like that. [indistinct chatter] Hey Jazz.. Hey can I have a double, please. Hi.. Tia. Hello. Jazz. I spilt my drink on you yesterday. Doesn't matter. You can spill it on me again. No no, I mean.. Can I get you a drink? This club belongs to my friend. I have a tab here. Hey bartender.. can i have my drink. Bartender..? Here you go, Jazz. Everyone around here knows you. I grew up here. Never seen you here before. Actually, I am from Amsterdam. Damn.. Amsterdam. I love that place. - Have you Ever been there? - Many years ago. I failed in my graduating year.. ..so we went there to party. But now I don't get time from my responsibilities. Responsibilities like? Business. Work. Family? Kids? No.. Do I look unhappy? Married types. I don't know. No! I believe in love, but.. ..wife and kids.. I love my freedom. So..what brings you here? I am here for some work.. Personal. I am very good about personal things. Don't hesitate to ask if you need help. Actually..I've been observing you for the past few days. I think there can be a lot more common between us. Really? I like it. I really like it. I love it. So..shall we move somewhere quieter and talk? Sure. Where? My home? Cool. Let's go. Put it on my tab. You like it. Who else lives here? Just me and my swag. And sometimes guests like you leave their essence behind. Wine? Yeah, sure. What's the matter? Trying to find more similarities? No.. No.. So.. ..what else do you do except for looking so gorgeous? I am a translator. And I've applied for a job in Paris. Paris. Romantic city. Actually, I wanted to talk to you. I don't know where to begin. You can begin from wherever you like. Actually, it's a little personal. I am personal too. And can be private. So the thing is.. ..I am 21-years-old. Born and brought up in Amsterdam. I was happy. My books, my celibate mom, my friends. Chatting over the phone for hours. You getting me right? Of course, I am. I am drinking to understand you better. But then do you know what happened? What? I grew up. That's what normally comes after childhood. Sometimes.. Eventually, the questions inside me started hating poetry. Even I hate poetry. Questions like why aren't people happy. Who am I? What is the meaning of life? I felt lost.. Till the age of 15, I didn't realise it.. And suddenly I felt really bad to find out that I don't have a father. Wow! What do you mean wow? Wow, I mean.. ..your story is so painful. Wow. Then I asked my mom, mom, where is dad? Do you know what she said? He's dead. No. She smiled and said no idea. I said what do you mean by no idea. She said you have three options. You have three fathers? Three options.. ..and one of them is my father. Understood. Understood what? So there is a 33.333 percent chance.. ..that you're my papa. Are you out of your mind? Why do you drink if you can't handle alcohol? It's true. There's a 33.333 percent chance that you're my papa. Get out. You're uttering nonsense. I am no one's papa, understand. Take a look.. A picture of your Amsterdam trip. That's where you met my mom. You two met.. ..and nine months later I was born. Don't be scared. I didn't come here to claim any stake in your property. We just need to get a DNA test, that's all. There are two more contestants in this competition. One of them is dead and the other one is in Paris. I am sorry, Tia, but your claim doesn't stand. Because your mom and I never did it without using safety.. I mean.. I never bat without wearing a guard. I have a tab at the medical store. I am sorry, but I am not your father. Your father is in Paris, and if he isn't then I am sorry for your loss. But I am not getting a DNA test done. Understand. Where is your mom? Amsterdam. She misses you a lot. Just kidding. She is very happy in her life. By the way, do you do anything for a living.. ..or do you just dress up and party. I am a very busy man. I've a Real Estate, Transport, Courier business. Wow.. Rich dad, huh! When will we get the results? Three days. So soon. That depends.. If the reports are positive, then you'll find out.. ..after 21 years that you're my dad. I am not your dad. Ms. Tia, you're next. Okay, then. Okay.. See you in three days, I'm excited! Okay. Bye. Jazz.. You okay? Rhea, do you have kids? No. Wait..why? Just.. Finally, you want a family. Never. I am a lion. And a lion is the king as long as he's alone. Family makes a man loser. Are you telling me or trying to convince yourself. You know what, just accept it. We're in the phase of life, where our past is longer than our future. And anyway.. ..everyone needs a family. Not me. Fine, I do.. But I can have a future with myself. You know what, you should try a serious relationship. Are you hitting on me? Excuse me, I've already crossed you out long ago. And anyway, after my divorce I know exactly what I don't want. Wow.. Wow Rhea, you're the reflection of my life. "The Suit Suits me.." "The Suit Suits me.." "I look Punjabi.." "I look amazing.." "I look different.." Bro.. " the Suit Suits me.."" We will invest.

You did the right thing by coming over here. Because every girl is safe with Jazz. Isn't that right, Jazz? Anyway, you look really tired. You take some rest and I'll see you soon. - Okay.

Then, I'll come with you. Where do you live? Look after Tia, she looks harrowed. Don't worry, I'll take a cab. See you. By the way, you two look quite similar. Spent my childhood studying. And soon after I grew into an adult. And as I became an adult, I got married. My husband liked to drink.. ..and whenever we got time.. ..we would drown ourselves in beer. But as I grew older, I stopped drinking beer. Because I couldn't stop burping. Now I only have gin and tonic. Gin and tonic is my favourite drink too. - Really? - Yes. - Let's have it tonight. - Okay done. What about Biryani? - I love Biryani. - Really? Then let's meet in the evening.

Tia, this is my home, not a zoo. And I didn't want to create a scene last night.. ..but what you did is not cool. Tanya is my girlfriend. That's Tanvi, not Tanya. Really? Her name is Tanvi? Whatever.

Bye. Sorry, it's a bit cold. Alright. So..that right there is your uterus. And that's the placenta. And that.. ..right there..is your baby. It's only as tiny as a bean at the moment. But in a couple of weeks.. ..those little lumps.. ..will become hands and little feet. And That..that right there is his head. It's amazing, isn't it? Greetings. Go ahead. I know I can't pay your rent on time. Forgive me for the delay. Your daughter's already paid your rent. Wait here. I'll be right back. This is chicken tikka, made at home. Tia loves it. Give it to her. Don't eat it yourself. Take it. Why did you tell Mrs. Malika that you're my daughter? - I didn't tell her. - Don't lie to me. She must have assumed. Girls never stay here for more than one night, do they? Very smart. Did she send these? Don't pay my rent next time. Sorry. I thought you needed some help. I don't need anyone. I forgot to go to the bank, that's it. Okay, but if you need money then I have some. That's my champagne bucket. Sorry, I thought that's a vase. Next time don't do anything here without asking me. I don't like changes. Okay, I am sorry. I am sorry. I need to talk to you. Can you please sit? Sorry. Please sit. I've decided. I am keeping it. What? Keeping the baby. Okay. Did you talk to your mother? I can't contact her. Is she in jail? No phone, no internet, till her Vipasana course doesn't get over. How long. 6 days or maybe 6 months. And your boyfriend. That idiot. Doesn't make a difference to him. What do you mean doesn't make a difference? He's the child's father. Will he take responsibility or not? My question exactly. I want to deliver here. What do you mean here? Here.. ..with you. It's shocking.. ..for both of us. I.. We can't think straight. Since this is our first time as parents. Okay.. Okay.. What do you see? A very scared man. No. A normal man.. ..who turns into a monster when his freedom is threatened. And who would like to raise a baby around a monster? You might think that I am trying to get rid of you. No. No. We'll chat on the phone every day. I'll visit you a couple of times in a year. Send gifts on occasions. But right now I cannot take responsibility of something as big as this. I cannot do it. I'll book your ticket to Amsterdam. And anyway.. ..a pregnant girl should stay with her mother for her own sake. I get it. No need to book tickets. I will leave today itself. Here you go. If you need anything, please let me know. Thank you. "Youth's on a fervor." "Love is crazy." "Youth's on a fervor." "Love is crazy." "I want to shower my love on you."

Feels like I am living in Big Boss' home. Please.. No, listen. I cannot do this. I need my privacy. You can't look at me. Do you do anything illegal? What? - No. - Then? Then? Do you feel guilty looking at me? Or embarrassed? Poor Rocky. He was a happy, and a cheerful guy. How did he suddenly die? He's alive but wants to die. Some girl showed out of nowhere, who is his daughter. And she is pregnant herself. Meaning he didn't just become a father, but a grandfather. Not to mention that she wants to live with him. That's such a great story. Your friend is really lucky. These things only happen in movies. Horror movies. Look, your friend's life is going to change. He already looks like he's doomed. And the poor guy's still so young. How young is your friend? Rocky.. I mean.. ..he's young. As young as Nazia? No. As young as me? No. Oh, wait, as young as you. He's in trouble, Rhea. Poor guy was living an independent life. He's stupid. And even though his name is Jazz, he's calling himself Rocky. Come on, Jazz. Congratulations. You could never have had a family on your own. And God's blessed with you everything without any extra effort. I can die. Will you relax? Your life has a new purpose. All this sounds so sweet.. ..but please don't tell anyone about this.

I am sorry, Rhea. What happened yesterday? A lot.. Did anything happen.. ..between us? It was amazing. Nothing happened, you idiot. Oh, man.. Why not. Because I am your age, and that's too old for you. And anyway, I am not your type. You don't have a type, Rhea. You're different. I wish my ex-husband knew that. You know, I always wanted a relationship.. ..where I would feel belonged. But I never found that intimacy. Jazz, what are you doing? What are you doing? What were you doing? - I thought.. - No, what.. What did you think? I thought.. What did you think? - I thought we had a moment. - No! I had an emotional moment. And you were hitting on me.

Uncle. But he's not normal. I want to meet him. No, no, Tia, this is not the right time. I'll introduce you two later. I won't say a word. I just want to see him. He's an ugly guy. Why do you want to see him? Just once. Please. Please. Okay. One look, and you leave. And if anyone asks, then we're just good friends. Nothing more. You should at least check your messages. I don't expect you to give a reply. But those two ticks at least indicate that you're still alive. Hi. Hello. That's Tia, my friend. And that's Dimpy, my brother. It's so nice to meet you. What happened? Who is she? No one. She's as old as your daughter, Jassi. Stop calling her my daughter. Who is? Then get to the point. Grover came over. He was asking about Malika.

You know, when I was young I used to love dollhouses. Are you serious? So Dimpy, what's going on? Tia, they are Dimpy's parents. Mine too. Hello. Hello. Greetings. Sorry, I am a little nervous. No need to be nervous. We're all family. Sorry. Please excuse me. You guys take a seat, and I'll be right back. All okay? There, you got your wish. Are you happy now? Hello, Greetings.. Now leave.

Dimpy.. You stupid fool.. Oh you! I've done nothing. Weren't you ashamed to have an affair with a young girl like her? Shame on you. Please listen to me Wait a second.. You're getting me wrong. Mom! Mom! This is my child. This is your child? No.. This is my child. This is your child and she's pregnant with Dimpy's child.. Mom.. She is my daughter, I am her father. And she is pregnant with her boyfriend's child. Dimpy is her uncle. You're her grandparents.. ..and now you two are soon to become great grandparents. Don't listen to him. Come home whenever you want to. Okay Take care. I've never felt so happy before. I came looking for my father but found a family instead. Thank you. Goodnight. Tia.. Yes. Come home. I'll see you tomorrow. No. Bring your stuff. Stay with me. "Let's steal some selfish moments together.." "Let's not worry about the future.." "..and spend some moments together right now." "Let's not make any promises, whether big or small." "Come over if you like.." "..don't stop to think." "You're the one for me, my friend." "My heart feels connected to you." "When you are around, I am always happy." "Happy.. Happy.. " "You're the one for me, my friend." "My heart feels connected to you." "When you are around, I am always happy." "Happy.. Happy..

Hiccups? I was getting hiccups and got scared. False alarm. Thank God. Yeah.. I am thinking about telling Rohan. You haven't told your boyfriend yet. And anyway, what will he do when he finds out. Relax, he's a nice guy. Fine, tell him. All the best. But don't get your hopes too high. Men brag about how brave they are all their lives. But pregnancy scares them out of their wits. Why are you wearing sunglasses at night? What are you? Feroz Khan? Fardeen. Come. [indistinct chatter] Here you go, Tia. Your favourite. Cupcakes, pastries, and chocolate brownies. What's the reason for all this love? What do you want in return? She's beginning to understand me. No, but I am getting to know you. Okay, we need some help with our business? Is it anything illegal? Do we look the goony type to you? Not us, just you. Okay, tell me. The deal's stuck because of one owner. She doesn't seem to agree.. ..and the investors are putting pressure on us. I fear that they might cancel the deal. Okay. And the owner is Mrs. Malika. Okay, I can try. Hi! How are you? I am fine, how are you? I'm good. Seeing you after a long time. Yeah, I know I was a little tied up.. Oh so sorry, I forgot to call. What do you mean you forgot? Come up.. Come up.. [Punjabi folk song] [Punjabi folk song] [Punjabi folk song] [Punjabi folk song] [Punjabi folk song] [Punjabi folk song] [Punjabi folk song] Too good. Greetings. Let it be. You always give me that goony type feeling.. ..which is why I never talk to you. But Tia explained me the deal so nicely, that I thought.. ..I should make this investment for my grandchildren. So.. ..you know everything about this deal. Yes. And you're ready to sign. - Yes.. - I mean.. ..if I bring the papers over tomorrow.. ..then you will sign. I am drinking alcohol, and you sound drunk. She is saying yes. I always knew she is your daughter. But what about your wife? She died in a car crash. Oh, I am so sorry. I'm bringing papers tomorrow. But I have one condition. What? When I was 5-years-old.. ..my father gave me a small willow tree. And said take care of it. Him and me, we grew up together. But look how tall he grew, and I didn't. Will they hack it down? But nothing grows on it. But I have many memories with it. Will this remain? Yes. Can I come over sometimes to take a look? Of course, whenever you want. Then it's fine! Bring the papers, and I'll sign it. Are you happy now? Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Congratulations. Thank you. By the way, what are you going to make in this beautiful place? We'll make it more beautiful. Why? It's perfect. Perfect doesn't make money. And what will be my percentage? Ohh.. What do you want? Just don't cut down her tree. Done. Congratulations, Singh Brothers. Finally you two got everyone's signatures. Actually, we're three now. Whatever..but you guys are great. Investors are very happy. As soon as the vacancy's done, we'll start construction. Will you let the tree be? What tree? The tree that's in the middle. The willow tree. Take the kids to the mall. We'll take care of the trees and gardens. Thanks to his quick thinking we're going to build towers in that place. And now he wants to bask in the garden. Rohan's coming. What? He wants to take me to Amsterdam. Where was he for nine months? With mom. They were both running a Vipassana course. It's pretty famous out there. Rich Indians come all the way to Amsterdam from India to enroll in this course. Jaswinder Singh. Yes, sir. Do you get sleep at nights? Yes...a good one! Shame. Do you have any shame? Does your word have any worth? What happened, sir? You sold me a property claiming it will be the next Soho. It's been five years. And the property's price has plummeted. What are you saying? Must be someone else. And anyway, that's your luck. If you haven't cheated, then what are you scared about. I hope you won't do the same thing with Mrs. Malika. No, I.. Somethings are not in my control. And anyway, there's nothing Mrs. Malika can do. Good morning. Morning.. Is it 3 o'clock already? Very funny. It's 9. In the morning. I'm Getting better. Of course. Early day at work? I am not going anywhere today. I want to chill with this little one. You're a very cute grandpa on the inside. Tia. Yes? Hey.. - Tia.. Tia.. Hi. Tia.. Oh my, God. Tia.. Look at this. Rohu. Rohu. Rohu. Mama, Rohan is unconscious. The energy in this house is not good. Whose house is it? Dad. Whose dad? My dad. You found him. Who is he? Guys, this is really embarrassing. I can't believe I've to introduce my mom to my dad. Mom, that's dad. Dad, that's mom. Papa, can you help, please? Are you sure this drug-addict is the father of your child? Why? Her father can be a sex-addict.. ..but lover can't be a drug addict. Mom.. Is he dead? No, it's an old problem. He faints whenever he gets too emotional. What are you doing? Oh my, God. - Careful. What? Tia, are you sure this negative guy is your dad. Are you sure this hippie's your mother? Okay, guys, stop. Please, stop it. Rohu. Rohu baby, are you fine? Are you okay? Yeah.. I mean.. I missed you. I missed you too. - I love you. - I love you too. Shall we get married? I think I am hungry. Can I get something to eat? Can you please get something to eat? Of course, ma'am. You looked pretty sweet in your younger days, Jassi. It's Jazz. Between meditation and hashish, I found inner peace. But I took one look at you and my penance were broken. You completely disturbed my nirvana. "Can someone stop time." "I don't want this night to get over." Remember Jazz. Okay, I am sorry. Okay? Right now there's nothing I can do for you except make this sandwich. I don't want anything from you. The Universe is listening to me. What nonsense. You dye your hair. No. It's natural. Don't try to teach me about nature. It causes cancer. You shouldn't use the microwave. Why? Will I get cancer? You chew tobacco all day.. ..and do cheap drugs.. and microwave's cause cancer. Hippie. There was a time when you liked..this hippiness. But wasting your entire life on drugs isn't. I am very happy. Because of you, I found my path. My calling. When you got me pregnant and ran away.. Okay, listen Ananya. 20-years-ago we had.. Sex.. That's it. There is no other connection between you and me. And anyway, this is your fault. For 21-years you didn't tell me that I had a daughter. You could've called. I hate phone calls. Because that causes cancer, doesn't it? You must have sold your phone to buy drugs. You're trying to disturb my chakras. No, I am feeling dizzy. The sandwich is ready, move aside. Accept it, we have a child together. No, we do not have a child together. You had a child, And that child lives with me now. Pass me my sandwich. Excuse. Be better than this guy ya? Okay, great. I'll book a hotel for you guys. Time and space is just a concept. Then live on the streets. Okay, please. For a few days.. ..can we all just stay together.. ..like a family? - Goodnight, papa. - Goodnight. What now? That's my question, Jazz. What happened to us? What? When? Tia.. Close your eyes and feel this moment.. ..and atone for your sins. Imagine.. ..sometime ago we were together in Amsterdam. One body, two souls. We're prisoners of time, Jazz. Youth is a lie. You know.. ..according to the calendar of rebirth.. ..I've turned 2370 years old. Let's reminisce our old memories and let our energies meet. Let's do it. What? Sex. No, no, no, Ananya, no. Tia needs a brother. - No, no. - All the stars have aligned. No.. All the stars have aligned. Tia.. Rhea? She is not on work today. Where are you? We need to talk. Go on. Where are you? At Jack's Cafe. [Indistinct chatter] - You won't believe what happened. - Hi, Jazz. Hi.. Are you guys on a date? - No. - Yeah. - Yeah? - No? Decide first. Let's talk later. Will you tell me what happened? You didn't tell me either. Is he your boyfriend? If you go on dates with such flat faces.. ..you're bound to lose faith in love. What do you mean? Nothing, I was just.. Jazz. Jazz, stop. - Why are you behaving like this? - Listen, I am sorry, okay. Go back inside and hold his hand. We'll discuss my problem later. Jazz, don't act like you're my boyfriend and I cheated on you. But it seems like one. That guy is normal. He wants to talk to me. He didn't attack me as you did. Come on, Jazz, I am not like those girls in the club. Do you even know what I want? I want old-school love. That has the maturity, affection.. ..and not just lust. Let me know if you want to talk. I want a friend, not drama. Breathe out. And push, Tia. Push. Breathe out and push. Push. Breathe out and push. Push. Breathe out and push. Push. I will shit in my pants. You don't have to push. You just have to support Tia, spiritually. Excuse me. What's going on? Practising for delivery. What for? So she has a natural delivery. To save ourselves from the fraud hospitals and doctors. We'll do it at home. In the bathtub. In the bathtub? That's what she's saying. Come on, baby. We've to go back to breathe out.. - Come on, breathe. Push. - Come on, come on. Breathe..push.. - Breathe..push.. - Breathe out.. Okay, everybody listen. Lie down.. Breathe..push.. Listen.. Everyone listen! First I suddenly find out that I have a pregnant daughter. Later her mother arrives and so do you. My home, kitchen, bathroom, my life.. ..you guys took over everything but I said nothing. But my grandchild's delivery will happen in a clean hospital.. ..under the observation of a doctor. And not in the bathroom. And you two won't talk like a bunch of drug addicts in front of my daughter. Understood! He needs meditation! She needs help. Wow.. Dimpy, how does it look? Looks huge. As I said, after this deal you guys will be the biggest brokers in London. Quite marvellous, isn't it? Now ask why I brought this here? Come on, ask. Well..if we build homes, it needs to be sold. And who is going to sell them? Singh Brothers. I am telling you, you guys are going to make a lot of money. A lot of money. No looking back. God bless. Where is the tree? What tree? This is a money tree. Guys, get ready to start selling.. ..the most expensive pent house in London. Dimpy, tell your staff that whoever sells the most homes. I'll raise the stake. Whoever sells the most number of penthouses in a month.. Yeah, not in a week, but a month.. I'll give you the ground floor. Tia, wait. At least listen to me. You're cheating Mrs. Malika. They are giving her a lot of money.. ..and pretty soon she will forget her tree. This is worth millions. Emotions often ruin deals. I promised her. You used me. Please don't overreact. Life teaches you to adjust. She will too. Then why didn't you? Why can't you accept the concept of time and age? Your word is your responsibility. But what do you know about responsibility? You've never cared for anyone in your life, except for yourself. Okay, I've had enough of your free advice. I am great the way I am. People often mistake their guilt for their responsibility. Like I feel for you. I don't want anyone in my life. You came here looking for me. And now that you're a part of my life.. ..you'll have to live by my rules. I came here looking for my dad.. ..but found a topmost broker instead. What's going on? We're going to Amsterdam. And Tia. She's coming too. Tia.. My intentions weren't to hurt you. I want to buy a home for us with this deal. I am doing this for us. Why are you leaving, Tia? We'll meet..on birthdays. There's always phone and texting. We'll stay in touch. Tia. Tia. Hurry up, we're getting late. Hello, sir. What time is the train? The train leaves at 11 o'clock tomorrow. But we're getting late right now. Are you ready? Thank you, sir. Your house keys. Thank you.

"Your baby girl is leaving." Excuse me. Mr. Rajendra Sharma please. Room no.204 sir. This way please. Jazz. Come in. What happened? Nothing. My youth can't tolerate my ageing. Doctors are stupid. They are saying change your lifestyle. I said come to my club, I'll change your lifestyle. Don't you have any family? Flying solo.. Remember! I'll stay with you tonight. No, bro. You go and enjoy. I will rest here. It's okay. Don't tell anyone I am here. I told everyone that I am in Ibiza for the music festival. Okay. "My tears are drying out." "My feet won't stop." "My tears are drying out."

"I see everyone weep." Grover. You won't cut Mrs. Malika's tree. What? You're joking right. Do you know what this means? The deal will get cancelled. I don't care. What nonsense is this? The cheque is ready. Don't you want to get paid? Dimpy, talk some sense in your brother. Otherwise, he'll be a jack of all for the rest of his life. But never become a businessman. If you love plants and trees then go work in a nursery. Why do you claim to be a broker? Won't cut the tree. He said you won't cut the tree.. ..then that's it. "I feel all alone." "My baby girl is leaving." "I feel all alone." "My baby girl is leaving." "I feel all alone." "My heart is leaving me." "I feel all alone." "My baby girl is leaving." "How could you be so cruel, Lord..." "Born to someone and taken away by another, they are." Tia. I will fix everything. Go away. Keep your energy away from Tia and her child. Please. I don't care about this deal. I am only worried about you and your child. He is lying again like he did 20-years-ago. I didn't see you grow up.. ..but I want to see your child grow. I want to take him to school.. I have only lived for myself.. ..but now I want to live for you. Please give me this chance, stay with me. I am fine with everything. Even him. I need you. And I can't live without you. I never fell in love. You're my first love. I love you. Don't go. Please. Tia. Tia, say something. Papa, my water broke. Oh my, God. Call the Police! I meant an ambulance. I love you. It's a girl. She's seven pounds. No, I am scared. It will be okay. She is beautiful. Like you. I think she looks just like you. Rocky. Grandpa, you took your time to open the door. I brought a gift for you. Hi.. Tia invited me. - And that flat face? - He was never in the picture. Okay.. - Okay-okay.. - Easy, Jazz.. take it slow! Tia, never leave me alone with Kiara. Why? Because if she does anything cute I'll faint. I'll check on her. Okay.. Okay.. Can I tell you something fantastic? You're the first baby in this world who will have to attend your mom.. ..and your grandpa's wedding. And your grandma is still a bachelorette. Let it be. I'll explain to you later. Your family is very complicated. Stop the time. I can't let this night end. Am I disturbing? I love seeing you two together. Same here. Happy Diwali. Happy Diwali, papa. Camera set.
