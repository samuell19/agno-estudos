[music playing] [gunshots] You motherfucker. [inaudible] You fuck. [gunshots] [gunshots] [sirens] Yeah, burn, you asshole, burn. Who are you calling an asshole, you prick. Now drop the gun before I blow a hole in a more appropriate place. [police radio] Hold the flashlight still, will you? Can anybody find the lights? I don't believe this. God. Oh, check it out. Let there be light. Hey, I got if from a Chinese lady across the street. Great, bring it over here. Hey, Turner, isn't it a little cold for Hawaii? Oh, yeah. I left my jacket in the car with Bobby. Oh, that's nasty. Wing [inaudible]. Yeah, it's a hell of a mess. And you can forget about fingerprints. Blue coats fucked us on this one again. Guys, how many times do I have to tell you, do not touch anything until we get here? We didn't. [phone ringing] Well, you might as well answer it. Oh, yeah. Yeah, he's here. Hang on. It's for you. It's an Officer Vanelli. Yeah. I got the son of a bitch. Yeah, that's right. He was holding. And guess what? He had a fun gun on him. Yeah, all right. All right, yeah. You're going to have to sell me over a blue coat. Hold on one second. Ah, shit, it's one of those fucked up phones. Man, I can't read the address. Hold on. Yeah, 1621 Curden. It all leads back to my brother's original story. Oh, and do me a favor. Get my jacket out of the car before they tow it, OK? Oh, your jacket. Yeah, I'll get it out of the car. I don't know what the fuck you're talking about. I don't' know what the fuck you're talking about. I don't know what the fuck you're talking about. --right out of the socket. It wasn't $50 though. It was a bad ass [inaudible]. All right, real bad. It's funny What people do when their sense of perception gets fucked up. So tell me exactly what happened when you got to the scene of the crime. Well, let's see now. I told the guy to empty his pockets and give me all of his money. I want to see my attorney, and I want to make a phone call. Did you say something? Yeah, I want to see my fucking attorney. I didn't think so. So give me all your money. Then what happened? Let's see, then I-- oh, yeah, that's right, I put a gun to his head, and I blew a hole in it. Wow, now that's intense. I got to get this down. I put a-- yeah, now talk about pre-meditative, man. The jury's going to love this. Say, what's your name again? Fuck you. No, fuck you, Clarence. I just went over your rap sheet. It took me an hour and a half. January 25, 1978, extortion and due process, conviction, released 30 days later for good behavior. March 25, 1981, armed robbery, no conviction, released 22 days later after incarceration. Hey, is this guy a snitch? Why is he getting released so quick? Are you a song and dance man, Clarence? I don't know what the fuck you're talking about. What's the deal, Clarence? I don't like getting shot at, only more than you do. But there's one thing I really fucking hate, and that's my fucking shoe. I want to know one thing. Where did you get the gun from, Clarence? Fuck you. No, fuck you, Clarence. We're talking about the fun gun, pal, the police issue? See my partner doesn't care about murder, but he's really into guns. I'm talking about the gun you were using target practice on me with. I'm going to leave you two guys alone for a little while, all right? I got to take a leak. You going to be all right, Turner? Hey, wait a minute, you can't leave me alone in here with this guy. There's got to be a witness. That's illegal. Clarence, babe, we all bend the law once in a while. You of all people should know that. Hey, wait a minute. You can't leave me alone in here with this guy. That's illegal. There's not to be a witness. Hey, wait a minute. Hey, [inaudible],, how are you doing, buddy? Get that heroine problem fixed yet? There's nothing I hate more than a jail house snitch. But I guess some people are just too lazy to do their jobs. You taking good care of Lieutenant here, I hope, because Lieutenant Parker has his troubles trying to find his way around. Well, maybe if your brother was here, I could buy your directions. Hey, fuck you, Clark. If it wasn't for my brother, you'd still be writing parking tickets on Sunset. Well, the pay wasn't as good, but at least I can still sleep at night. This way. Everything's still on for tomorrow, right? Yeah, everything's going as planned. I even talked to the governor. Thank god, your brother's still got some friends left. Yeah, some friends. The governor would hang his own mother if there was a re-election in it. Look, you got to understand, it's not too popular to be defending a dishonest cop right now, especially when he killed the mayor's 16-year-old son. My brother didn't kill anybody. And don't give me that honesty crap. We all have to draw the line somewhere and you know that. I'm sorry, Frank. Jeez. Hey, nice suit. Is it new? Always with the jokes. How are you doing, kid? Yeah, work sucks. Me and Turner are on graffiti patrol again this week, but what else is new? Well, let's face it, they don't exactly like it when you blow up your car. Yeah, word travels fast around here, huh? Yeah, around here it's the only thing that does travel fast. How's Turner doing? Ah, he's doing all right. But he still won't do a visit. Like I said, it's all right. You tell that little punk when I see him, I'm going to kick his ass. The next time, I'm blaming everything on him. You know this guy, Clarence Dumont? He's connected. No. Are you downstairs in H South? I don't travel down south much. It's mostly transit district stuff. Yeah, tell me about it. He's never done more than six months. And every time he's been popped, it's been a felony. He keeps on getting off on technicals. This is bullshit. Anyway, I found another gun on him. - [inaudible]? - Yeah. County or state issue? It was a county. It's automatic. It's got the serial numbers filed off and everything. But this one's a little different. This one's fresh. It couldn't be more than a week old. That makes seven, including yours. Well, hopefully after tomorrow, it's not going to matter. Where's Frank? He had to leave. He wasn't feeling too good. Hey, but anyway, look. You said everything's going to be all right for tomorrow, OK? And if this gun thing-- Forget about the gun thing, Bobby. Look, I feel pretty good about tomorrow too. It's been two years. [inaudible] about enough. Do you want me to get anything for you? You can get me out of here. That's about it. OK, anyway, take care of yourself, Roy. Take care of myself, that's easy part. The cops are the sickest fucks in here. I wish that was a joke. Yeah, so do I. [inaudible] [music playing] NEWS ANCHOR [on tv]:: And additional information on the case and time served on the trial may bring the release of Officer Vanelli in tomorrow's hearing. The attorney's of Officer Vanelli have proposed the new detectives never actually caught up with the young [inaudible] the night of his death. However, [inaudible] reports have positively identified the murder weapon as the police issued [inaudible] assigned to Detective Vanelli. I can't fucking believe he's late already. Something's wrong. Something's terribly wrong here. Just hang on, pal. He's going to be here any minute. Excuse me. Excuse me, Mr. Vanelli? No, no. That's Vanelli. Oh, excuse me. Excuse me, Mr. Vanelli? I'm from the public defenders office. Yeah, so? My name is Evelyn Kurtz. I was appointed by the city of Los Angeles to serve as Thomas Vanelli's attorney. I am correct in assuming that you are his brother. Excuse me, Mr. Vanelli, I'm afraid I'm going to be late. There's not much time and I need to find out some information regarding arrangements that were made during the preliminary hearings and also any other pertinent information that you might have regarding this case. What the fuck is going on here? Excuse me? No, excuse me. I seem to be missing something here. My brother and I already have counsel on retainer. There must be some extremely bad mistake. Excuse me, Mr. Vanelli, but I'm afraid the only mistake here is that you obviously have not been informed properly. Were you aware that Franklin Damato was admitted to USC Medical Center late last night with a serious pulmonary disorder? Christ, Turner, get to a phone. Call a hospital. I don't give a damn if he's on the operating table. Just get through to him. Excuse me, Mr. Vanelli. I'm afraid we're going to have to make some sort of motion here. I need some information. Stop it. I'll make it easy, OK? You're completely out of line here. You want information? Call 411. I've got my brother with his head on a chopping block in there. And there isn't any time to chitchat with some law student about how fucked up the legal system is. Listen, Mr. Vanelli, I talked to the district attorney this afternoon. I got him to lean back a little bit on anything that might make the press a little hungry. We can get 30-day extension of cause and effect, no loss or lean against the plaintiff's rights. Ryan went for that? Let's just say he's a friend of mine, an old friend. We'll have another pitcher, babe. Right, and we'll have another Coke, please. Fucking Frank. Here's to Frank, a hell of an attorney when he's not sick. God, is she gifted. She's [inaudible] experience. She's out of her league. Bobby, she is hardly out of her league. Yeah, but it's incredible. A man's life is at stake here. It's murder. That's just the point. I don't want anything to do with it. Oh, Bobby, how can you say that? It's simple. First of all, she's a fucking yuppie. And second of all, I don't think she has enough experience. Well, all right, here we have to disagree. First of all, she is not a yuppie. And secondly, I think she has plenty of experience. Oh, forget it. I've got somebody else on the way, an old friend of the family. But Tom's just too ashamed to ask her, I guess. So I'll do it. I don't let that bullshit stand in my way. I just don't think Evelyn has enough experience, don't you think Turner? Evelyn? Yeah, I guess. Can have a beer, please? Forget it, forget it. Never mind. Never mind. Look, I've got to get this guy home. He's still on duty. On duty, are we? Well, at least I am. I got to call in for you, OK? OK, come on. Let's go. No, I want to stay. Man, go ahead. You go on without me. I'm going to hang out. I'll get a cab, or I'll get a ride from somebody or something. Go ahead. - You sure? - Yeah. - Fine. Fine. Look, do me a favor, you take it easy. Don't let this guy drive the cab, OK? Take it easy, Turner. [music playing] Tonight, all members of the Los Angeles Police Department get a special two for one at the bar with tropical drinks. Wow, you're really knocking those down, cowboy. Yeah, I certainly am. What do you think you're doing, going through those purse. - No, you don't understand. Yeah, right. What the hell are you doing that? [scream] [piano keys banging] [scream] [cheering] [scream] Get up against the wall. Hey, what do you think you're doing? This little weasel was going through the purse. You're not calling my little Roger a thief, are you? You're Roger? [inaudible] Fuck you, [inaudible]. [interposing voices] Shit. Dammit. Sit down, man. Fuck you, man. Shut up, my man. Fuck you. Damn fucking rednecks. Look at these guys. [interposing voices] Hey, homie, you got a problem? Shut up. My problem's you, man. You shut up. - Fuck you. Vanelli? Release. If if wasn't for you, I wouldn't be in this fucking place, man. Hey, fuck you, dude? You got a problem, huh? You want to start something? Huh? You want to start something? - Get him, man. Get him. Get him. Get him. [interposing voices] Luckily, the didn't file a report. I believe this is the kind of thing they put you on suspension for a relatively long time. As it is, I'm sure the DA is already gotten a little word about this. Hey, I appreciate the ride home. But I didn't ask for it, all right? Oh, you didn't. Well, once again, I'm afraid you've been misinformed, this time by your own memory. I suppose you don't remember the phone call you made last night for a half hour free. Free phone call? Yeah, the free phone call. You drooled in my ear so much, you probably short circuited the phone at the jail. Shit, I did that. I can't remember a thing. Oh, that's refreshing. No, it's not. Trust me. All right. I think I will. You will what? I need somebody I can trust. I need your help. My brother needs your help. This is it? Yeah, this is it. Listen, Mr. Vanelli, it was in my best interest to get you out of any long term incarceration you might have incurred after last night's little escapade, solely for the purpose of keeping publicity at a minimum. Now, as I informed you, I've been assigned by the court to represent your brother. And any bad publicity we must keep at a minimum. Now, if you're so inclined to discuss this case, you can reach me at my office during regular business hours. [buzzer] OK there's fresh towels in the bathroom. There's clean sheets on the bed in the guest room. You have anything in the refrigerator except the cherry yogurt. And I'll be at the office until 6:00. Your landlord will be home at 6:00. So you'll be gone when I get home. And here's cab fare. You can pay me back later. Evelyn. What? Why are you doing this? I read your brother's files. I believe he's innocent. [speaking spanish] I'm sorry. [speaking spanish] No I'm sorry. [inaudible] I saw the cab already gone. I thought you were gone. No, I was taking a shower. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. I'm concerned that-- did you cut yourself? Yeah, you scared the hell out of me. I jumped, but the razor didn't. Here, let me take a look. Well, that's not so bad. I'll get you a Band-Aid. I'll get you a Band-Aid. So how was your shower? Did you have a nice shower? Yeah, a great shower. You have a nice shower. Is it still bleeding? I think so. Here, here's a Band-aid. No, no thanks. I don't need it. You should have used my electric. Yeah, electric. I should get that cab right now. My landlord should be home by now. I can't believe I lost my / that's got to be the third time in two months. Forget about the cab. I'll drive you. I went to your brother's attorney's this afternoon. Have you ever been to his house? No, not really. Is it a nice place? Well, I'm not sure. I may have been at the wrong place. Well, it's somewhere in Beverly Hills, right? Yeah. He called and gave me the address, 101 Dalmatian. Oh, that's right. Yeah. Yeah, like the Disney film. Disney? Yeah, "101 Dalmatians," don't you remember that? I think that's a little bit before my time. Why? How old are you? How old are you? Old enough. For what, to hang out all night at nudey bars drinking like a delinquent teenager? Listen, Evelyn, I can find my own way home. Wait a minute. I went to the right place, and no one was there. I knocked on the door for 20 minutes. Well, what do you want me to do about it. You're the one that's so damn clever. Well, I thought he had a [inaudible] or something. It just didn't seem right that I would go, and he would ask me to come over, and then not be there for the appointment. He does have a live-in nurse. Maybe he got the time wrong, or the address wrong. No, no, no. It was 101 Dalmatian right off of Burten Way. Well, maybe he had an attack or something. Maybe he had to go to the hospital. I don't know. Are you sure you got the time right? Come on. Let me take you home. I promise not to mention last night again. OK. Thanks. I called the hospital, and they have no record of him ever having been admitted. I'd call my service, but I've already called them three times. [inaudible] OK, thanks. Well, wait a minute, is the red light flashing? Yeah, it is. I hate it when nobody leaves a message. Nice place. Yeah, it's not my fault. I know it's a little small. Whenever I'm late with the rent, my landlord's got this giant crank downstairs. And she gives it another turn, and my walls move in tighter. Yeah, hello? Yeah, hi. This is 266. Any messages? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh, yeah. OK, thank you very much. Nothing. It's too late to call him now. - Well, what time is it? 1 o'clock. No wonder why my landlord was pissed off. She's usually passed out by 9 o'clock. Thanks for dinner. It was great. So are you going to keep your promise or what? Oh, yeah. Sure. Sure. Please, do it. Please, sit down. Sit down on the bed right here. Go ahead. OK. You see, now when you fire a gun, only the tip of the bullet leaves the barrel. Here, let me show you. No, thanks. Oh, don't be afraid of it. More people get killed accidentally because they're afraid of guns. And you can imagine. I've never held a gun before. It's so heavy. Yeah, it's made of solid steel, except for the handle. Now, basically, there are three parts to a bullet, OK? You've got the firing cap, the shell casing, and the lid. Right. OK, now the hammer strikes the firing pin inside the gun, which in turn strikes the primer, which sets off an explosion in the casing, which pops the lead off at 155 feet per second. Now, try to outrun that. OK, but what about that rifling thing you were talking about? Oh, yeah. Well, you see, every barrel has several small grooves, slightly curved. So the lead catches on those grooves and spins so that the bullet will travel straight and instead of wobbling off any old direction. See, now look at these pictures. See, that was the bullet that was fired from Tom's gun in the lab under controlled conditions. Now that's the lead they took out of Mayor Crenshaw's son. Notice the match. I do. OK, but now what about this one right here? This one got flattened on impact because it hit a bone. See, most people don't realize that, but it's almost impossible to get a rifling match all the time. See-- or this could have been a hollow point, or it could have been x'ed. X'ed? Well, that's when somebody takes a hacksaw, and saws an x in a top of the lead. See, and then the bullet splits apart on impact. Basically, it kills people better. I'm impressed. You certainly are an expert on guns. I'm no expert. My brother, Tom, he's the expert. He taught me everything I know. I got to hand it to Frank, if this is the kind of evidence he's been up against, no wonder he's not feeling good. Yeah, it's quite dramatic. It circumstantial. But it's like first impressions. You know how sometimes you can be mistaken. Yeah. I seem to be constantly learning that. Me too. Oh, you're home. Sorry, I didn't know you had company. How did you get in here? The door was unlocked. Look, man, where have you been, man? I've been trying to call you all day. I was worried about you. This better be important. It is. Bobby, Frank's been killed. What? Do you really think so? Yeah, I think the new dragon is 10 times better than the old one. I don't know, maybe if they use the same theme song. They do. No, they don't. [singing], remember? They don't use that. I thought they used that. You get anything good? Just the facts, man, just the facts. That's good. Hey. Hey, why don't you guys do something useful? Like what? I don't know, get a transfer off my department. Excuse me, miss. You can't come in here. - It's OK. She's with us. - That's OK, miss. Just go right ahead. Just don't touch anything, fingerprints, huh? Yeah. [inaudible] OK. How do you spell Penelope? Is that with an E or an I? With an E. Maybe it stands for business or something, like IBM. Oh, no, no. Maybe it stands for a gang. I think we should visit our buddy, Clarence's house. I think he might be able to translate this thing. I doubt it. I'm telling you, I'd beat the living shit out of him. He had absolutely nothing to say. It was like talking to those towelheads in Iraq. At least them, we could throw them out of the helicopter afterwards. You guys really didn't do that shit, did you? Fuck them. I can't believe they stuck us with this car, man. We're supposed to be undercover. Well, I think Wilson's still got a bug up his ass about you. You said we were lucky to get this one. This is ridiculous. We might as well paint this thing black and white. Funny you should mention painting. Graffiti patrol. Great. I can't believe they stuck us on this again. Yeah, well, they still can't believe what you did to his car either. Oh, catching Clarence didn't count, right? Hey, look, I thought it was a great bust. I got this great leather jacket out of the deal and you got those fabulous new shoes. Hey, that reminds me. I got to stop at a Sears and get me a pair of real shoes. Do you know, is there a Sears around here by any chance? Somewhere. But let's see, now we got to look for Clarence Dumont. And where's that at? That's up right up here on the corner of Crack and Eight Ball. Yeah, let me see. [record skipping] Oh, Jesus Christ. Come on, honey, put the gun down. Come on, honey. Don't hurt yourself. Put down that gun. Put the gun down. That's it. Take it easy. Just put the gun down, baby. Come on. Just drop the gun. Come on, honey, don't hurt yourself. Fuck. Call 911. Fuck. Don't even think about it Clar-- put a clamp on it. Against the wall. Against the fucking wall. You turn around, you're going to lose your fucking dick. Now how much shit you got stashed in this place, Clarence? What are you talking about, man? I am clean. You call accessory to murder clean, man? What are you talking about? I want some fucking answers, and I want them now. And if you don't give me those fucking answers right away, your fingerprints are going to be all over the murder weapon. All right, man, what do you want to know? Well, it's a little late to talk about the hazards of drug abuse and your old lady. So let's talk about guns instead. Let's start with the fucking gun used on me last week, and we'll end up with this one. I don't know nothing about no guns, man. I'm telling you, I don't know nothing. Why don't you tell him, man? I don't know nothing about no guns, pure and simple. He seems to like you. Why don't you talk to him while I go outside and check his car out? Hey, wait a minute. I'll tell you whatever you want to know, man. We can make a deal, man, a new deal. A new deal? Fuck, somebody's in the car, man. Make your deal with Turner. And when I get back, I'll see it it's workable. Hey, don't touch that dial or I'll blow your fucking head off. Put your hands on the wheel. Where the hell did you come from, man? New York, originally, but now I'm here. Hey, fuck you. [gunshot] The fuck, he had a gun, man. He tried to kill me. Go after him. I'll call it in. Fuck. Fuck. [sirens] Son of a bitch, god dammit. [inaudible], motherfucker. [gunshot] Get the fuck over, motherfucker. Fuck you, you cock-sucking fucking dick. [gunshot] Fuck. [train whistle] Oh, fuck. Pull over. [phone ringing] Evelyn Kurtz's office. May I take a message, please? Yeah, is Evelyn Kurtz in? Well, do you know what time she'll be back? Sir, I do not know when she's going to get back. If you'd like to leave a message, I'll be happy to take a message. Do you know where she went? No, I do not, sir. Would you care to leave a message? Don't you know anything? I know one thing, that you're extremely hostile. Could you hold, please? It's for you. Oh, good. You're there. Look, I thought I'd never get a hold of you. Oh, right. Great. Hey, did he have anything to say about my brother? Listen, I've got something I want to show you. Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure, sure. OK, but look. Look, I need a favor. I need a favor from you. No, no, I'm on my way to the jail now. All right, OK. I'll tell him. I'll tell him. Look, you've got to do something for me. You've got to find something. I need to know this address. Yeah, you've got a pen? It's 3656 Sunswept Drive. All right, yeah. I'll see you later. OK, bye. You can't park here, miss. This is a private entrance. And there's no parking anywhere on this side of the canyon. You'd get ticketed before you unfastened your seat belt. I'm sorry. I couldn't seem to get the car started. Are you out of gas? Oh, gee, I don't know. I didn't even think to look. I mean the gauge is all the way to the right. That's full, right? Yes, ma'am, I believe it is. Why don't you get out and let me have a look at it. Would you? It's a new car, and I'm just not even very used to it yet. You know how that is. Thank you. It's no problem. Is that you, Evelyn? Mayor Crenshaw, I don't believe it. So what in the hell are you doing up here? I thought that was you, but I wasn't sure. Is that your driveway I'm blocking? Oh, believe me. I'm used to it. This parking thing is an ongoing deal. Seems like no matter how many parking bills I pass, there's never any place to park this damn boat. They even towed me away. I got to handcuff William to it. Even then, I'll get some wise rookie giving me a ticket to make a point. Ah, there's nothing to it. Oh, thank you so much. I'm really grateful. It was sputtering all the way down Sunset. Well, listen, can I invite you in for something? Oh, Mayor, thank you very much. I'd love it. But I've got court early tomorrow morning. You still doing PD work? Yeah, I'm doing specials for the county. No kidding. Maybe I should get your number in case I get caught tearing up those parking tickets of William's. I don't think Mr. Vanelli would appreciate his case being jeopardized by foolish counsel that was steering him in the wrong direction. I appreciate your advice, Mr. Mayor. But I can assure you that I won't get stuck in traffic like Frank did. Is he going be all right? Well, he ain't going to be fucking his wife for a while, that's for sure. Well, he's lucky he only got kicked. Word in here is that Clarence was heavily into guns and crack. Tell me about it. That chippy who shot herself was wired out of her skull. It was only a matter of time. Besides, Evelyn told me something about some file. She's going to check it out. She'll let us know tomorrow. What files? I don't know, something she found at Frank's house. Anything to do with that PINA thing? Yeah, have you figured that out yet? I don't know. It's somebody's name. Penelope? Penelope's with an E. This thing is really getting weird. I got two murders, two bullets. I got two bodies. And then this PINA thing in cough syrup. Two shots, one of them smashed into the skull and the other one in the gut. It's a total beauty. Beautiful, but no fucking gun to match it with unless you luck out with SID. I won't know about that till late tomorrow. 100 guns, it takes a long time to check it out. As it is, I had a bribe. Bribe? Hey, don't worry about it. It's only fixing a couple of parking tickets. I am worried about it, Bobby. Hey, look, you're in a lot of trouble here, pal, OK? I'm just trying to help you out. One shot in the head and the other one in the stomach, I can't figure it out. Even the chic shot herself in the head. Tyrone. What about him? He had two leads in him too. Yeah. The only guy that didn't have two leads in him is that fucker, Anderson. Anderson? Yeah, Clarence's buddy, the guy with the guns in the crate? Anderson. Anderson, why does that name sound so fucking familiar? About six liters of hydrate and another gram of sodium, and it will be ready. You see, it's a special solution that stops the bullet without destroying the rifling works. It's kind of like Jell-O. Can you put this in the fridge for me? Yeah. And what time do you want me to give you a call tomorrow [inaudible]? Late. I've I'm working on this solution for about 10 years. It's the only one like it in the world. I've been shooting this thing 43 times on this case. OK. OK, Aaron, there's the ticket. Great, thanks. I'll tell him. Thanks. Great. Oh, my new assistant. I've been going through them like crazy. Hey, Bernie, what's up? How are you doing there, Bobby? OK. Everything's for sale. Hey, say there, you got a nickle for the juke box? The jukebox here takes dollar bills. Boy, have I got a song to sing for you. Let me see that ticket. Oh, the guy who got this ticket travels in some mighty high social circles. Guess who's address this is? Try me. 3656 Sunswept Drive, the humble abode of one honorable Franklin Crenshaw. The mayor, you're kidding? Do I look like I'm kidding? So did you talk to your brother? Yeah, I told him you were going to be early tomorrow. But forget about that. What about the stuff you picked up at Frank's house? I don't want to talk about that until I'm sure. Don't you trust me? Well, of course I trust you. Do you trust me? Can I have another one, please? Another Virgin pina colada coming right up. So what about the guy you chased? Anderson, Philip Anderson. You know him? Philip Anderson, wait just a minute. Wait just a minute. That's him. It's Tyrone's crack dealer. He was the one that was with the mayor's son the night your brother and Turner lost him. Are you still going to have a drink before dinner? Yeah. What do you have? For the next couple of hours, we have two tropical drinks for the price of one. I'll just have a cup of coffee. Oh, do you have espresso? No, no way. OK, I'll just have a plain cup of coffee. Oh, and could you bring that with cream and sugar, please? Uh-huh. I'll take one of those. No, no. You get two of those. Yeah, but I just want one. For the next couple hours, you get two drinks for the price of one. OK, OK. I'll take two, but I'll just drink one. OK. God, it's impossible to quit drinking nowadays. Well, it's more difficult for some people. What do you mean by that? Nothing. OK, now where were we? The rooftop. The rooftop. According to Frank's records, your brother and Turner were chasing the mayor's son across some rooftop and out of the [inaudible]. Write Right. Well, apparently, there was someone else there too. Yeah, Turner. No, besides Turner. Well, what do you mean? Look, your brother's whole defense is that he didn't catch the mayor's son the night of the murder. And if he didn't catch the mayor's son, he certainly didn't shoot him at close range like the coroner's report said, especially with two shots, right? I'm telling you, if turner didn't have a convenient attack of his vertigo, he would have been a solid eye witness for my brother. He's still having a tough time facing Tom. He won't even do a visit. He's got this big guilt trip over the whole thing. OK, so there you have it. So if you buy your brother's story that he never caught up with the mayor's son, then it stands to reason that somebody else shot him. Now, I'm telling you, I think that somebody else was that Anderson kid. He was out there waiting for him, and he shot him. Yeah, but you're missing two important points here. Number one, there's motive. And number two, the bullet from Tyrone's stomach was a perfect rifling match to my brother's gun. First motive. I want you to listen to something. From counsel for the defense, people versus Thomas Anthony Vanelli, in consideration of the actions and allocations inferring the sale of narcotics and abuse thereof to Tyrone Crenshaw by with and from Phillip Anderson. Counsel, hereby request the presence of Phillip Anderson as witness and possible implied suspect in the murder of Tyrone Crenshaw, signed Frank Price, date July 22. Where Where in the hell did you get that? That's privileged information. But Frank was going to point the finger at this kid, Anderson. Yeah. And whoever found out pumped a few slugs into him before he could talk. Not a few shots, two exactly, two in Frank, and two in that Spanish nurse of his. Everything's in twos. I just talked to Tom about that. [pager ring] Where's the phone? It's right over there. So you want another drink? Is that two for one special still on? Uh-huh. Yeah, sure. I'll take two. There you go. I've got to go. My secretary just called. Well, what about dinner? Well, I'm sorry. We'll have to take a rain check on that. What can be so important this late at night. You tell me. There you go. I have something for you, Mr. Vanelli. Have you got a light? - How do you know my name? - You don't remember? No, sorry. Should I? I work over at the Coco Bowl I work around, you now? Yeah, I remember now. You're the bitch that smacked me. Say, wasn't your hair brown then? A new wig. Please, don't be angry with me Mr. Vanilli. I'm very sorry. Besides, I want to make it up to you. Yeah. How do you want to make it up to me, by biting off my dick? If you want me to. I'm rather fond of it. All right, so what do you want? A trade. A trade? Yes. I've got something you want. And the county jail has got something that I want, my little Roger. What? That little purse thief? Look, honey, I'm not in the market for what you're selling. And besides, soliciting is against the law, or don't you know that? Oh, Mr. Vanelli, you've got it all wrong. You see, it's not me that I'm selling. It's this. Where in the hell did you get that? I think it will help your brother. It's the gun that killed Wang Da Chow. Do we have a deal? [knocking] Oh, Jesus. What? It's me. Open up. I got to talk to you. I am busy. Just come on. Open the door. Come on, open up. I got to talk to you. It's important. I was coming. This better be good. Hey, Turner, you got a rag? A what? A rag. Hey, throw me the rag. I sure hope you know what the fuck you're doing. Don't worry your pretty little face. Just toss me that rag. This is exactly how they do it at SID, only they got a bigger budget. All right, so where did the broad get the gun? It was a job. Her boyfriend was paid $50 to pick up in the alley off Curtis Street. Wait, Curtis Street. Now, isn't that the import/export warehouse where we found Wang Da Chow? Sometimes your memory amazes me. And guess you paid him the $50? Haven't a clue. Anderson The late Phillip Anderson, gun collector extraordinaire, Clarence's partner, supplier of dangerous narcotics to Mayor Crenshaw's son. Wait, wait. Wait a minute. Now I don't get it. What about the gun we found on Clarence? Are you ready for this? It's so fucking brilliant, you won't believe it. Well, probably not. But try me anyway. Hey, you got any vice grips? Do you have any idea how fucking late it is? Yeah, you weren't sleeping anyway. My point exactly. You know, we keep catching these fuckers, like Clarence, you find the weapon on them. well, you know he just shot somebody, and we match the rifling of the bullets with the gun, but they don't match. Thanks. But we overlooked two very important things. Now, remember that word two. Two. I'm going over everything in my head, right? Two bodies, two bullets, right? And then it hits me, two guns. Two guns? Yeah, two guns, and two bullets, but only one good bullet. OK, now I don't get it. What do you mean by one good bullet? Just give me a second and I'll explain ti all to you. But first, we need a control. A control? Yeah, you know, a control. Didn't you take science in high school? No, no. I hated science. You need a gun, and we'll use it as a control. Wait, my gun? What about your gun? My gun's in the house. Now, my gun's in my house. Do you want to stay here for two more fucking hours while I go home and get my gun and come back here? Great. Now I got to wake up Donna. Clarence, he had two guns, right? He takes the bullet from one gun any an x into the lead. Now, what does that do, right? When the bullet hits the body, it breaks apart, right? It's totally untraceable, OK, especially in close range at the head, on a shoulder blade, in a bone area, right? So it breaks apart. It's completely untraceable. There is no way you are ever going to get a rifling match on a bullet of that time. So there, OK. What does good, old Clarence do? He takes the other gun, and he leans over the already dead body, and he pumps a bullet into fleshy area, let's say the stomach, for instance. So then he turns around, and he runs, and he runs, and he runs, and he runs down the block. He runs around the corner, he runs down the alley, and he takes the fresh gun, and he tosses it in a pre-determined stash spot. It throws the fresh gun away and he purposely hangs on to the other gun. Bing, bang, we catch him, right? And we're as happy as little Boy Scouts. We take the weapon down to SID. The rifling doesn't match, case dismissed, no evidence. Meanwhile, Blondie's boyfriend comes by later and he picks the gun out of the dumpster. Now we got to take the rifling here and match it with the pictures. And we have to do this tonight? Yeah, tonight. Wait a minute, now you're not going to fire guns right now, right, tonight? Someone's going to call the cops. We are the cops. [gunshots] Excuse me, isr. What is it? There's an Evelyn Curtz to see you. Evelyn Curtz, oh, sen her in. Bobby, if you put a hole in my pool, I'm going to fucking kill you. Hey, chill out. Why do you think I took half the powder out of the bullets? What the hell are you doing out here? Are you coming in or what? - Hey, I got it. You fucking idiot. Hey, would you mind getting the bullets while you're down there? You stupid jerk. [phone ringing] BOBBY [recorded voice]:: Hi, this is Bobby. I'm not at home right now. But if you leave a message after the beep, your call will be returned as soon as possible. [tv on in background] [gunshots] I'm going to tell you one more time. Don't ever touch the body until I arrive. I don't care if you are wearing gloves. Where the hell did you get those things anyway? Well, I got hem at the gas station. They give them out now so you don't get gas on your hands, the self-serve pump? Does this look like a gas station? This is the scene of a crime for crying out loud. Excuse me. How long are you going to be? I'm sorry. This is going to probably be an all nighter. I got measurement to take. I got fingerprints. Besides, this is a cop. I got to do this one by the book. If you can find a place to stay for a couple days, it would be a big help. I got to do this one by the book. Come on. I'm taking you to the motel. - Well, wait a minute. - Yeah, come on. Come on. You're going there, and you're not going to tell anybody where you are. [inaudible] So I went to the mayor's house. I thought it was the only fair thing to do. After all, we do work together. We're still professionals. Yeah, Lieutenant Parker was a professional. We're rank amateurs compared to him. And you of all people should know not to divulge any information to a suspect until you have enough proof to lock him up. I have the proof. I got back the serial numbers on all the guns that you found and compared them to the ones that your brother had found. Then I got the numbers of Anderson's gun and also the one that you found on Clarance. They were consecutive numbers starting with the last issue of the last handgun distributed by the police department. See, that's why I was late to Campbell's. My secretary finally got a hold of the list. What did he do, sleep with a girl to get it? Very funny. The fact is, that according to the manufacturer's records, the LAPD purchased 5,000 more guns than were listed on the LAPD records. And guess whose name was signed on the purchase order? Mayor Crenshaw's. You guessed it. And you figured this out all by yourself? Don't patronize me. In reality, your brother is the one that deserves all the credit. I get it. That's the information that the Mayor's son was using to blackmail his father. He was skimming guns off the top. Yeah, and was going to turn him in if he didn't give money to support his drug habit. Which he didn't. Exactly. And when the word got back to the guys buying the weapons, he was offed. They paid somebody to shoot the Mayor's kid. Yeah. And then they set it up to make it look like your brother did it. See, then they killed two birds with one stone. They figured that your brother was getting just a little bit too close, and they wanted him out of the picture too. Hey, you haven't told me about that pool thing yet. The pool? You This two gun theory. That's why you came to my house, remember, this brilliant two-gun thing you just had to tell me about? Yeah, yeah, OK. I'll tell you in the morning. You just get some sleep now, all right? The next stop on your list, [inaudible] a little Wang Da Chow was skimming off the top. You know, Bobby, I had a hard time getting back to bed after you left. That's too bad, because I figured you and Donna were good for at least two more rounds. But then again, I forgot about that kick in the nuts you took from Clarence last night. Oh, come on, Bobby. He was a fucking scumbag and everybody knew it. So you blew him away. One less scumbag. What are you trying to do, clean up the city, pal? Maybe it was something he said to you in interrogation room when I left you two alone that day. Maybe I should have stayed around for the strong arm. Look, you don't understand. They wanted me to kill your brother, all right? I talked them out of that. They just wanted me to shoot him. Who's they, Turner? Mayor Crenshaw. Are you just another pawn like him? You fucking make me sick. You shoot the Mayor's son, and then you set up my brother for the Patsy. Look. I didn't want to do it. But I didn't have any choice. I was into them for some big money, Bobby. They were going to kill me. You really had me going there for a while. There was one thing I couldn't figure out, how you got the gun. Now , faking your fear of heights, so you wouldn't have to be an eyewitness alibi for my brother was one thing. But getting a hold of his gun and shooting the Mayor's son, now that was a work of art. That's the one thing that I just couldn't figure out. But you fucked up. You let me get a little too close to the help. It's amazing what one small favor will do for the right person. She, Blondie, she gave me a blow by blow description of the night my brother had with her. It was the same night that he lost Tyrone running across the rooftops. He's always been a little on the weak side when it came to women, especially when they were for free. While he was slipping it to her, you were running down the alley with his gun and planting a fresh, clean lead in the Mayor's son. Only he'd already been shot with a nice x-style bullet from Anderson's gun. What a way to go. Kill me once, but shoot me twice. Look, I didn't want to do it, Bobby. But sometimes things just don't turn out the way you plan them. I thought it was just going to be a straight hit. I didn't know it was going to be your brother. But see, he got too close, man. He got too close to the fucking guns, Bobby. You remind me of alcohol, Turner, always waiting around just to fuck me up. It's still kind of cold to be wearing that Hawaiian shirt, isn't it, pal? Just about as cold as it was the night when you took out Frank and his Mexican nurse. Who would have thought that PINA pina was Spanish for pineapple? I think that pretty much points the finger at you, pal. So what's next? You got my name on one of those bullets or do I have to shoot somebody with one of yours. If you think I'm going to move in with my brother, I got news for you, pal. I got that attorney working on it. And he's going to be walking the streets tomorrow afternoon. Not Evelyn. Yeah, that's right. She figured out the gun scam before I did. But then again, she travels in the same circles. We make a good team, don't you think? Go ahead, make your move. Try to split us up. But you're going to have to shoot me more than twice before you can get to her. I got to do it, Bobby. You leave me no choice. Go ahead, you dumb fuck. You haven't got the balls. Wait, wait, wait, wait a minute. Let me just turn around so you can shoot me in the back like you did to Clarence. Go ahead, pull the trigger, motherfucker. Go ahead, you dumb-- I told you you'd have to shoot me more than once. But then again, you'd have to use real bullets. I took the liberty of filling your gun with blanks when we were at the pool. Look, you're not going to take me in, Bobby. It's not going to be that easy. It's over, Turner. Even the mayor is going to fall on this one. Look, I'm going to turn around, I'm going to walk away, and you're never going to see me again. The only way you're going to take me down is to kill me. And I know you too well, Bobby. You don't have what it takes. And I suppose you do. Look, Bobby, I was in a tight spot. I didn't have any place else to go but-- [gunshots] Two guns? Two shots. I can't believe that Tom is going to be released in a couple of hours and this whole ordeal is finally over. Finally, I'm glad about that. But I think it's good. It's good with few release papers, that's bad. See that son of a bitch? He's still walking the street. Bobby, Bobby, calm down. And just stop it. There is nothing you can do about it. This is a system that has to be followed. Fuck the system. Bobby? Bobby, come back. Crenshaw, you may think you can lock people up and write your own rules. But the people aren't going to take it. Who do you think you are, you punk? You so much as look at me the wrong way, and I'll have you writing parking tickets in a neighborhood that doesn't know how to read. There's a hammer behind every bullet on this force, and you looking at the man who pays your salary. Don't make my fingers itch, Mr. Vanelli, or the next time you see your brother's name, it will be carved in stone. [music playing]
