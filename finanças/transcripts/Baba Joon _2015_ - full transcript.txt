BABA JOON See you later. -Bye. Okay, clutch... first gear, clutch... Go. Pothole, watch out. I know how to drive. Watch the road and look out for potholes. Stop, stop. Press the clutch and stop. Stop, stop! Turn off the engine, turn it off-. Get out. Dad, what's wrong? There's a hole in the hose. I have to make it shorter. No, that won't work. "I've torn more shirts than you“, I know what I'm doing. Wtzhak, what's wrong'? There's a hole in the hose. You have trouble with your pickup every day, you can afford to buy a new one. What for? This one keeps going. Oh, okay. Can I take the jerrycan? Sure, dear, go ahead. Want me to tow you home with the tractor? No, thanks. I'll fix it myself. I saw you bought new equipment for the turkey barn. Yes. I'm renovating the old one. Renovating? I thought you wanted to sell the farm. Why renovate? You don't want to sell? You'll have to ask my boss. Boss? Who's the boss? Moti, are we selling? No. We aren't selling. -You aren't selling, okay. In any case, Wtzhak joon, in Hebrew we say: "Better a close neighbor "than a distant brother.“ If you want to sell, I'm right here. Thank you. Bye, Moti. All the best. Dad, I have a solution. Can't you see I'm fixing it? Dad. Moti, I have to replace the hose. Just listen, Dad. Moti, the chicks will die in this heat. I have a solution, just listen. Okay, go ahead. We'll put the jerrycan on the roof, we'll take a hose and pump the water into the radiator until we get home. Okay, lift it up to the roof. Okay. Get up there. Careful. Let's go. We can't go in for the next lwo days. Why'? Why'? Because as soon as a chick opens its eyes it looks for its mother. If you go in there, they'll think you're their mother but if they grow up together, they'll regard each other as their mothers. It's called "imprinting? Moti, turn that off! Don't make any noise, it scares the chicks. I already told you. Please don't come in here again. Go to the barn, feed the chicks. Moti. What? Come to Baba. I'm coming. How are you, Moti-joon? Give me a kiss. Come sit next to Baba. Can you sing a song for Baba? Sing a nice song for Baba. My heart yearns to go back to Isfahan Back to the city that's like half the world My heart yearns to go back to Isfahan... Hello, Amir, Blackie. Come to Baba. Come. Come here. Moti. All this needs to be thrown away. No, that's got to go. Come here, Shukri-joon. Look, my dear. That stays, I'll take it myself. That stays. All those have got to go, that and that. Not this! Moti, this is not a junkyard, it's a turkey barn, it has to go! No! Get up! I'm talking to you, don't behave like this in front of them. It has to go. No. Wtzhak, wait a minute. Leave it here for him. I need to clean up here. It has to go. Listen to me-. Listen. Weren't you ever a boy? Didn't you ever play? The chicks are so cute. -Yes. But we worked so hard. When the pickup broke down, I was so afraid that not even one of them would make it to the barn. But Moti really helped you, didn't he'? Yes. You push him too hard. He needs to learn. But you know he doesn't like this work. Neither did I at first, but I got used to it. Sorry. What if he doesn't want to? I'll force him. What's the matter? -Nothing. What did I say'? -Nothing. "If you bend a branch too hard, it breaks.“ Moti! Come here! Come on! Run, run. Close the door, close it. Now when I need him, he's gone. Moti! Moti, come here. You have to learn this work already. This, Look. You grab it from here, okay'? Like this. You're hitting me?! I raised you and fed you, and you hit me? You hit your turkey?! Are you crazy? Moti-joon... Bastard. Come here, it's okay. What happened, ma'am? Nothing. Nothing. Come, work with me. Come. Put it in the truck. Wtzhak, he's just a boy. -Just a boy'? At his age I took care of the whole barn. Put it in the truck! Why are you standing there? Go get it! Go! Go help him. No, he has to learn. What happened? Nothing, Baba. -Go to sleep, Baba. Let's go. Okay, I'm going- Good night. -Good night. Did you catch it? No. That's enough. Ow, Dad. That hurts. It hurts'? -Yes. I'm not you. "If it doesn't hurt, it doesn't get clean.“ That hurts! Do it softer. Vacation starts today. Remember, vacation is very dangerous. Whenever you have a free moment, read the Mishnah. Now each of you come up here and get a Mishnah to take home. We'll start here. Thank you. -Why can't I see your yarmulke'? You're not ashamed of it, are you'? No. -Good. Next. Let's go, who's next? Don't dally. Hurry up. You can start reading now if you like. Who didn't get a Mishnah'? Me. What are you waiting for? My father says that other things are more important. So there are more important things than the Torah at your house? Those people are always working, they have no time to read. Shut up, don't talk about us. Quiet back there. I realize it's a matter of money, so each pupil will donate a few shekels as charity so you can buy the Mishnah. Bastard. What did you say? You swore, didn't you'? Leave the classroom now. He didn't do anything, sir. Get gOinQ- Out, out. "You mustn't swear at the teacher.“ Hello. -Hello, Mr. Morgian. I've been waiting for you, what happened? I swore at him. Let's go outside and hear what you've done. "Remember: God doesn't go on vacation, be observant also on vacation.“ Tell him you're sorry. Wtzhak, I'm a teacher. I have a degree in Education. My job is to teach him. You don't want him swearing at you, too. My son would never raise his voice at me. Tell him you're sorry. You insulted him. I'm sorry for hurting your feelings, Moti. Drive. Drive by yourself. Dad, can I go faster? Sure, go ahead. Here's all the equipment you wanted. 40 waterers. The feeding equipment. It's all ready and will be delivered. Thank you. Good. -Dad. Look, a cordless drill. You want it? -Yes. -Take it. Thanks. Come here. Come see what I bought for you. Come on. I work so hard for you and you can't even say thank you'? At least in front of strangers? Look at me, I'm talking to you. Okay, okay. Thank you. Talk to your friends that way, not to your father! Who asked you for a barn anyway?? Where...? Go to hell! What have I done to...? This is the thanks I get'? Bastard. Okay, now thank your father. What for? Honey, he made such an effort for you. Show him some respect and thank him. It's not a gift for me, it's for him. We're the most pathetic family in the world. Go water the trees. Go on. Moti, look. Look at him watering the trees. Do you know how much you mean to your father? Don't you want to help him? I want to help him, he's my father. But I don't like this work. Okay, when you grow up, you can do whatever you want. But now you have to do as he says. Then what can I do? "A tree that can't bend "in a storm will break. "Wait for the storm to blow over.“ Wtzhak! Thank you, Dad. Hold on tight! A little more. Pull, pull. Here they come. Moti! Well done. Well done, look how he's grown. Hello. -Hello. Moti. Hello. -Hello, Uncle-joon. Look how you've grown, I can't believe it. -Yes. Well done. Hello, Darius-joon. -My dear Sarah, hello.

"May God bless you and keep you. "May God forgive you. "May God grant you peace. "The Israelites will receive my name "and I will bless them." Your hands got softer, Baba-joon. I got old. I got old. I've lost all my hair. No, you're not old. I brought you all nice gifts from America. In America everything is big. Houses, cars, roads. What's that tape? I bought you a video cassette of Iranian songs. Baba-joon, the video clips that you love. -Good. Tea. -Tea? Sweetheart. Did I come here after ten years to drink tea with my family? You have a good bar like the Americans. Brother, wine from 1972? Are you a collector? I bought this bottle for you ten years ago, you still haven't opened it'? I'm too busy for drinking. So now's the time to drink. Sarah-joon, glasses, please. Brother, who built this? -Dad. Really? -Come take a look. This big wheel rotates all these. I took this and turned it into a spinning wheel. Good job. Sell this to Americans in Beverly Hills and you'll be a millionaire, brother. Let's go. Together, to America, now. Right now! Will you come? I have, I have, ltook. Thank you. Are you happy with the barn I'm building for you'? You're building it for me? You wish. What are you building it for'? For Moti. For Moti? Are you crazy? You're killing yourself, brother. It's slave labor. Remember one night Baba made us inject the turkey? And I let one free. I remember. Baba took off his belt and beat the hell out of me. Yes. How I cried that night... I wanted to die. And now you're building this for Moti? When I was a boy, Moti, whenever I wanted to be alone, I'd come up here and relax. Moti? Do you like working in the barn with the turkeys? No. Is that not okay? No, It's fine. Dear brothers, let's welcome our holy Sabbath. Candle-lighting is at 7:10 p.m. This announcement is in memory of Nissim, son of Rachel.

Is it okay? Yes. -Very good. Very good garage- Come see my buggy. I took a scooter, cut it in two, gave it three wheels... Come see how I did it. I put the accelerator here. -Accelerator.

But your son has your genes, look what he built, I can't believe he did it on his own. You didn't help him? I'm happy that you came. -My sweetheart. Good for you, you and your son. You're done here, come give me a hand, Daddy. Let him play, it develops his mind, it's good. He sits and plays all day while I bought those chicks for him. This just can't work. Come, Baba-joon. Don't get your clothes dirty. They're the kind that clean easily. So what's it like in America'? They call it “the land of opportunity.“ There are people who got rich from nothing, I swear to God. Are there lots of Iranians? Rich, successful Iranians, thank God. There's Iranian television. No! Iranian magazines, newspapers, stores, you name it. Darius, tell me the truth, are you happy there? Well, I'm all alone. Being alone isn't that good. My heart misses the family. If I yell out in my apartment, no one will hear me. Then why don't you come back here? Come back here? Maybe... Moti. Give me a hand, get me one, Daddy. Come sit down. No, I'll bring them to you. No, Daddy, you have to learn. Okay, look. Open its beak and put it here, like this. Like this, then press the pedal, okay'? Here. Put it here, its beak here, then press the pedal. It doesn't hurt them'? No, Daddy, it's like clipping fingernails. It won't hurt them. Why do we have to do it anyway? We have to clip their beaks when they're young, otherwise when they get bigger they'll peck each other to death. It's good for them, understand? Understand? Understand? Okay. Put the beak here and clip it. Put it in there. Moti! Pick it up! Moti! -I don't want to! Fine. You'll clip all their beaks even if it takes all night. Moti. Haven't you done anything? No. I brought you dinner. Come eat. You haven't eaten since lunch. Come and sit. Sit down. Eat. Eat, Daddy. I'm not hungry. Clip its beak. I don't like this work. I didn't like ii either. Clip its beak. I want to do what I like. Not like you. Clip ii! Put it in there and clip it! When I tell you something, you must do as I say. Understand what I'm saying? Wtzhak, leave him alone. Leave him alone. If I had another son, he could do as he pleases, but I only have this one! Go home, sweetie. It's not his fault. Get yourself another wife so she can fill your barn with kids. "Top-quality Turkey Farm Wtzhak Morgian & Son“ Brother, brother, careful! Wtzhak! -What happened?

Now take off your suit, put on work clothes and go work in the turkey barn. Baba-joon. If you don't like my suit, I won't wear it any more. If you want me to wear work clothes, I will-. But I told you, I'd never set foot in that barn as long as I live. Shame on you! Baba, leave him alone. Me and Moti can run the place. What are you doing? The turkeys are dying and you're here goofing around! Put that down and get out. Come. Go to hell! Uncle, who are they? Me and your father on a boat. And them? That's Baba-joon and your father.

Why didn't he come? Cohens. Where is Moti? He didn't want to come. Stay out of our business. You push him too hard. If you had kids, you'd understand. I don't want kids if I have to act like you. You don't want kids because you're selfish. No, it's because I never wanted to be like Dad. Hello. -Hello. Moti, come home. No, I'm not coming home. That's enough, Moti. Get up, let's go. Wtzhak, let him stay, it shouldn't bother you. Stay out of my business. You left us all behind and now you come and tell us what to do? I didn't leave, I ran away. From what? From this village, from the mean people and the damn turkeys! And what about me? What about me')? It's your decision to stay. Moti, I am your father, Do as I say. Come home. Wtzhak! -Leave me alone!

Baba, I told you, Moti and I will run the place. Moti? Moti can't even hold a turkey, How can he work in the barn? Baba-joon, times have changed. Your grandson won't be working in the barn. Besides, Sarah and Yitzhak need a break... Shut up. Shut up! I don't want to hear your voice! You never had a good word to say to me my entire life. I'm your father! When I say stay, you stay! I don't belong here. Then go! Get out of here! Go to hell, go! Darius... Don't go. Tell Moti to come back here. Okay, Dad. Moti! Moti! Baba, I hate you! You're mean! Enough! What's wrong with you'? Who are you fighting? You've become like him'? Have you become like him'? Get out. Get out! Oh no, oh no, what have you done'? Wtzhak, give him a beating, teach him a lesson! Go. Forgive me. I'm sorry, Baba-joon. BABA JOON
