[music playing] [cheering] Safe. SPORTSCASTER: And here with me right now, the greatest right fielder in the game of baseball, Roberto Clemente. Bobby, congratulations on a great World Series. I would like to say something for my mother and father in Spanish. [speaking Spanish] [crack of the bat] [cheering] [cheering] [cheering] ANNOUNCER: A uniform with the number 21 will never be worn again. [cheering] [car horn] Dad. [car horn] What? DRIVER: Move it. Oh, oh. Sorry. Thanks, Maddy. [music playing] (LAUGHING) Man, Dad, I have never seen you drive like this. But I've seen you drive like this. Shut up, lame wad. Hey, hey. I don't like that kind of talk. Sorry. What are you going, like 85, Dad? It's only a game. And do not tell your mother. Don't say a word. [police siren blip] [police siren] Dad. What? Look. (GROANING) Oh, dammit. Hi. License and registration, please, sir. Here you go. Do you know what I clocked you doing, Mr. Straka? Look, look, I've never done this before. And I swear, I swear I will not do it again. But I didn't want to be late for Roberto Clemente Day. That doesn't qualify as a legitimate excuse for speeding in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. You're right. I'm sorry. Roberto Clemente. Afternoon game, huh? Yes, 1:15, barring a rain delay. Man, he was something, wasn't he? Yeah, he was my favorite player. So I'm praying this weather holds. Well, rain or shine, you gotta drive more careful with these kids in the car, man. Absolutely. You're absolutely right. You know, I was at every home game in the 1971 series. So was I, me, too. In the 1972 season, I was there the whole last week. I was there, too. And it was unbelievable, wasn't it? Yeah. When the Pirates came home from Baltimore after winning the World Series, me, Mom, and my little sister, we were at the airport, along with, uh, well, half the city. Well, the players [inaudible]. And there he was. My little sister, she takes her little, green, felt hat, and she stretches it out. And Clemente... he picks her up, and he signs it. That's Clemente. He didn't have to do that. He didn't have to do that. Look, look after these kids, man. Get the hell outta here. Dad, was he gonna cry? [music playing] That last week of the '72 season... [exhales] you had to be there. You had to see it. Oh, no, not another story about the '70s. Th... this is not just another story about the '70s. (SARCASTIC) Yeah, right. MICKEY STRAKA (VOICEOVER): It actually started earlier. It was 1966. Back then, we all had two things in common. One was our grandfathers spoke with accents. And the other was our love of a ballplayer we considered the greatest of all time. I'm Clemente. I thought you said I could be Clemente. Not this time. Come on, let's go to the park. Yeah! Last one there's a rotten egg. [shouting] Safe. MICKEY STRAKA (VOICEOVER): My brother Roger's muscular dystrophy didn't keep him from being a part of the game. Roberto Clemente comes to the plate. MICKEY STRAKA (VOICEOVER): We had Clemente's routine down, from the head cranks to the bat drag to the batter's box routine. Plays at first and third. His team needs a hit, with a runner on second and two outs. Listen to the crowd. [imitates cheering] I dare you to throw him the Uncle Charlie. Get it! Come on, man. Go get it. Get it fast. Throw it, throw it! Come on! Safe. Safe? You were out. I was safe. You dropped the ball. Out. Safe. Out. Safe. Out. Safe. Out. Safe! MICKEY STRAKA (VOICEOVER): We loved the game, so much so that somebody got into a fight with somebody else almost every day. It was like part of the routine. It was $0.35 to hop a bus down to the Pirates games. And if we couldn't go to the game, we would pretend to be managers, making out our lineups with baseball cards. ANNOUNCER (ON RADIO): It didn't get him, but that was dangerously close. One ball, one strike to Roberto Clemente. MICKEY STRAKA (VOICEOVER): And on the day I thought was the greatest day of my life... Hey, Dad, Dad. I got the new Clemente. [arguing] Oh, no. MICKEY'S DAD: (ANGRY) ...one chance to have a peaceful evening. MICKEY STRAKA: (DISAPPOINTED) Again. MICKEY'S DAD: Leave me alone! [footsteps] [door shuts] [footsteps] [door opens] [CAR DOOR SHUTS, IGNITION STARTS] Dad, Dad! Dad. MICKEY STRAKA (VOICEOVER): I didn't know it then, when he drove down that cobblestone street on Verona Avenue, that it would be the last time I'd ever see my dad. But no matter how bad things got, I always had Roger and the game. Game ain't over yet, boys. Game ain't over yet. Let's go. Come on, strike him out. [MUSIC - T. REX, "BANG A GONG (GET IT ON)"] UMPIRE: Batter up. Come on, Mick, let's go. Hit it out of there. Let's go, Mick. [applause] UMPIRE: Play ball. MICKEY STRAKA (VOICEOVER): Roger and I had this connection. In his eyes, I was playing for the both of us. Be patient, Mickey. Give it your own Uncle Charlie. [crowd chirping] UMPIRE: Strike! What, you never seen a breaking ball before? Pitcher's a nibbler. Gimme something I can hit. That's right. Shake it off. He wants to bring the heat. That's a big mistake. [crack of the bat] Yeah, kid! Woo! All right. [cheering] Safe. Yeah. Yeah. Woo. Yeah! Way to go, Mickey. Nice hit, Strike. Thanks, man. That was your 45th ribby. Yeah. Mom didn't make it again? Nah, doctor called. She spends way too much time there. That's all right. When are you gonna get better, bun boy? Shut Shut up, jerk-weed. She'll be here, eventually. [chuckling] Your mother needs you, either. I just got back from the doctor's. We've talked about this before. [sighs] Mickey, please, this is hard on everyone. What? What's going on? Everything's going to be all right. I don't want to go to California. Roger, it's the best thing for your health. California? What about me? No, I'm not going. I'm not going. Sit down, [inaudible]. Michael. Michael. Michael STRAKA. Michael. Michael STRAKA. Michael. STRAKA. STRAKA. Get your head in the game. Come on. Get your head in the game. One more out. Let's go, STRAKA. Let's go, STRAKA. Let's go. Let's go. Come on, now. Fastball [inaudible], Bobby. Wait for your pitch. Come on. Come on, now. Strike him out, Bobby. Come on, strike him out. Let's go, STRAKA. Let's go, STRAKA. Come on. You got it. All right, use that wood on your shoulder. Put it away, man. Strike two. STRAKA. Come on, man. Come on, Mickey. Send him walking. [music playing] Strike three. Aw, man. [cheering] [dogs barking outside] So Mom says we can get the new Led Zeppelin album. Who's we? They're my group. You don't even know who they are. Yes, I do. [door opens] Hi. Hey. [door closes] How'd it go? It went great. Hit the game-winning home run. You missed it. [gasps] That's wonderful. I miss the old Mickey, Pittsburgh Mickey. He's batting ninth, Mom. He doesn't do the Clemente thing anymore. He'll come around. He always does. I miss the Clemente thing. [school bell ringing] [music playing] Ah! Doing some exploring, Magellan? Now I have gum in my hair. You're gross, you know that? Thanks, jackoff. What do you girls want? I'll see you last period. [coughing] Hey. [shushing] I'll give it back to you when I'm done with it. Nothing on the Pirates? Are you kidding me? Why don't you read a book once in a while, instead of the sports page? 3,000 hits is a big deal, Rog. Not around here it isn't. Some lifetime thing, and I'm 4,000 miles away. 2,458, to be exact. Well, you know where you can stick your numbers. [shushes] He's just a ballplayer, Mick. What's with you? You and your presidents books, what, are you above all this now? Get your ass kicked for saying something like that back in the Burgh, wheelchair or no wheelchair. Oh, go to hell, Mickey. I don't need your sympathy. Fine. [shushes] Don't even bother. I'm leaving. (LOUD) OK? I'm leaving. Hey. ANNOUNCER (ON TV): And that's why they're calling him one of the greats of baseball. That's up the gap in left-center. He's not gonna get to it. And chalk another one up for Roberto, hit number 2,997. He's just three hits away from the magic 3,000. [click] [smack] ROGER STRAKA: Hey. [snickering] It's only a business trip. And don't forget to take your medicine every night. after dinner, OK? Add that to the list. You're only going to be gone for three days. I mean, how will you know if we do all these things? I'm your mother. I'll know. Now, Mickey, you're in charge. Your brother has an infection. Which I get all the time. It still needs to be watched closely. Mickey, make sure that... [somber music] Mickey. Mickey. I'm talking to you. Mickey, you're not even listening or paying attention. How am I supposed to leave you in charge? You have two sons, you know. [phone ringing] Mickey, get that. [phone ringing] (ANNOYED) Get it. [phone ringing] [phone ringing] Hello? GRANDPA STRAKA (ON PHONE): Mickey boy, it's your grandpa. Hey, Poppy. GRANDPA STRAKA (ON PHONE): I was listening to the game tonight. I missed you boys. Clemente got a hit. You think he'll do it before the season is over? Um, well, I mean, there's four games left. GRANDPA STRAKA (ON PHONE): It's really exciting. If I could, I'd fly you and your brother back, scalp some tickets on Forbes Avenue. Mickey? Um, yeah. I'm here Poppy, don't worry about it. It doesn't... it doesn't matter. GRANDPA STRAKA (ON PHONE): You don't mean that. Hey, how's the Clemente book? I started it. I didn't... GRANDPA STRAKA (ON PHONE): That cost me $1.99, Mickey. Read it. It'll do you some good. Can I speak to your mother? Yeah. Mom, how many times are they gonna do this? You know I hate needles. I know, hon'. But we've done it dozens of times. Sometimes it's hard to find a vein. It doesn't make it any easier. Please hurry. Just squeeze. Squeeze. Got it. And there we go. OK. [phone ringing] OK. [kisses] I don't understand why he's not improving. Marilyn, with MD, his muscle mass is only going to deteriorate. And he will be more and more susceptible to upper respiratory infection. You did the right thing. If you think something's wrong, we draw blood, and we do some tests. But he's not getting any better. And that was our sole purpose for moving to California, but he's not improving. Lots of small steps, remember. There's going to be setbacks, sometimes big ones. We're trying to avoid that. This is just one of those periods. You can only do so much. And then you can do a little more. Roger's 14. And he's still able to use crutches. That's good, considering the odds are against kids with MD ever graduating from high school. [music playing] [school bell ringing] Bye, guys. Bye. [music playing] Wanted to see me, sir? Yeah, sit down. [sighs] Your little stunt in the library yesterday went too far. We're suspending you for one game. We don't take to that kind of behavior around here, son. You don't take too kindly to anyone who's not from here, sir. And I'm not your son. [MUSIC - THE GRASS ROOTS, "LET'S LIVE FOR TODAY"] When I think of all the worries people seem to find and how they're in a hurry to complicate their minds by chasing after money and dreams that can't come true, I'm glad that we are different with better things to do. May others plan their future. I'm busy loving you. I don't think it's rained five times since we've been here. I miss thunderstorms. [basketball net rattling] Me, too. I miss Poppy. Yeah. He was always there for us, wasn't he? You're not the only one who misses Pittsburgh. But this is your home now. [thunder] MICKEY STRAKA (VOICEOVER): It might have been her home, but it sure didn't feel like mine [music playing] MICKEY STRAKA, YOUNG (VOICEOVER): "Early in his life, he was a star in track and field. But his first love was baseball. I'd be lost without baseball, Clemente once said, I don't think I could stand being away from it as long as I was alive. If you have an opportunity to make things better, and you don't do that, you are wasting your time on this earth." on this earth." on this earth." [crack of the bat] [cheering] Hey, Rog. [coughing] What the hell are you doing? I think I'm gonna go back to Pittsburgh and see Clemente get his 3,000th hit. Mickey, staying out of the liquor cabinet is number two on Mom's list. I'm serious, jackoff. I figure Mom's gone, I can use her car. Probably take about three days to get there. Clemente needs three more hits to get 3,000. You're gonna drive across the country on a learner's permit? Right on. You'd get kicked off the baseball team. Who cares? I'm batting ninth, anyway. Mickey, Clemente can get three hits tomorrow, and it would be over. What are you gonna do, turn around and come back? Nah. I'm going to the Burgh. You'll never make it. I'd kill for a Chip Chop ham sandwich at Eisley's. Yeah. You know, I bet you Lis' still works there. (WHISPERING) Oh, Lisa Carlo. [tsks] Well, I figure Mrs. Stern can look in on you. And Danny's mom can get you to and from school. So you'll get around OK. Get around? In case you haven't noticed, getting around has posed a little problem for me. If you want to go, pack your bags. Well, I can't. My doctors are here. Mom has my routine down. Whatever, bun boy. I'm not a bun boy. Just go to sleep. Mickey, you'll never make it. Just go to sleep, Roger. I'm leaving in the morning. I'll see you later. When Mom calls in at night from San Francisco, I'm not covering for you. Do what you gotta do. [car horn] [music playing] [birds chirping] I thought you said I couldn't make it. You won't. We have a shot. You don't have a plan, do you? What highway are you taking? I was gonna get a map on the way. Route 66 across the South Cut up to St. Louis, stop at the arch on our way through. Straka Travel Agency at your service. You're just gonna slow me down. I'm a big boy. I can take care of myself. Besides, everyone needs a sidekick. You know, Abbott and Costello, "Who's on First?"" You're just gonna be a hassle, all right? I'm gonna have to put your ass back on a bus to LA. Deal. I'm ready. Packed it last night. Couldn't go back to sleep after you woke me up, stooge. All right, wheels. Let's go. You're slowing me up already. Eat me. [MUSIC - ALICE COOPER, "UNDER MY WHEELS"] The telephone is ringing. You got me on the run. I'm driving in my car now, anticipating fun. I'm driving right up to you, babe. I guess that you couldn't see, but you were under my wheels, honey. Why don't you let me be? 'Cause when you call me on the telephone saying, take me to the show, and then I said, honey, I just can't go, old lady's sick and I can't leave her home. The telephone is ringing. You got me on the run. MICKEY STRAKA (VOICEOVER): We were On the road and heading east. I was glad Rog tagged along, even if I didn't act like it. He kept me company. Go easy on those candybars, Ace. Bet you can't tell me what Clemente batted in his rookie year in 1955. [sighs] You wanna learn something? Read this. Well, he didn't average over .300 over his career until 1963, his ninth full season. You're giving me numbers. I don't care about statistics. Baseball's all about statistics. No, you can't learn real baseball like that. By what, using your brain? Oh, I guess I wouldn't know, 'cause I didn't play the game, right? You can learn a lot about the game without playing it. So what's your point? My point is is that you gotta use your heart, not your head. That's real baseball. You gotta feel it. And that's how you see Clemente. I see these stats, and I see greatness, too. Stats don't lie, Mickey. You just don't get it. Nothing he does is typical. I mean, the way he basket catches a fly ball, the way he takes another base almost in a gallop, his helmet comes flying off, he'll disappear into the right field corner whirling that ball on a frozen rope to third, tagging the guy by 6 feet, the way he approaches the plate, you know, his ritual, that's... that's Roberto Clemente. That's real baseball. Can't find that in a box score. Yes, this is Mrs. Straka. I got your message. (CONCERNED) Bronchitis? Well, how could you not tell that from the X... yes. OK. Well, I'm not going to be home, and... yes, I'm... I'm calm. I just want to know if the meds are the right meds and... yes, I understand. Thank you. [phone ringing] [phone ringing] [phone ringing] [phone ringing] Yes, I need the next flight out of San Francisco. To Los Angeles. [music playing] MICKEY STRAKA (VOICEOVER): By the end of day one, we were tired, all right. But nothing was gonna stop us. We were on our way to the Burgh. Hey, you up? Oh, good, you're awake. [coughing] You've been sleeping for over two hours. So? What do you keep waking me up for? I'm tired. Mickey, I have a stomach ache. Maybe we should pull over. Your stomach hurts? It's the Clark Bars. I told you. No, we're not stopping now. You made the schedule. We gotta stick to it. All right, fine. All right, I'll be fine. Where are we? New Mexico. Ah, the Land of Enchantment. [coughing] Hey, did you take your medicine? I'm fine. No, I'm fine. [coughing] You should take your medicine, Rog. Yeah, I probably should. [metal jingling] Oh, shit. What? Oh, shit. Uh. It's not here. (PANICKED) You forgot your medicine? Yeah, I put it in here. I just... I don't know where it went. So what do we do? [music playing] [ambulance siren] Um, his name is Roger Straka. All we need, really, is some... some antibiotics for him. OK, you have to have a prescription before I can give you a refill. Well, we don't... we don't have a prescription. It's just an infection. He gets them all the time. It's not a big deal. Where's your mother? She's working late tonight. HOSPITAL STAFF (ON INTERCOM): Dr. Morgan. Paging Dr. Morgan. [phone ringing] [coughing] OK. Wait over there. We'll get you looked at. Hi. OK. What the hell? What did he do? [gasps] No, he didn't. No. [rings bell] Oh, that's amazing. I'm so happy for you. Oh, God. I'm a little jealous, too, I got to admit. [rings bell] How much longer is it gonna be? Hold on a sec. Well, the doctor's with your brother now. You have to be patient. We're very busy tonight. Well, we gotta get going here. We're way behind. So you guys had a date? Really? That soon? Wow. That's... that's a lot of work in such a short amount of time. [inaudible] I want to know everything. DOCTOR: Miss Gale. Ah, that sounds beautiful. [phone ringing] [ekg machine beeping] Excuse me, miss. Um, is Roger Straka ready? His medication should be ready at any moment. We're still waiting for a parent or guardian to sign off on his release. Guardian? We have the meds for Straka, bed 5. [phone ringing] Did you say something? No. [phone ringing] [music playing] Uh, sorry. Perv. Doctor. [phone ringing] [phone ringing] (WHISPERING) Roger. Mickey, get outta here. You're gonna get us in trouble. Just take this out. We're already in trouble. Take these. What? All right, let's go. This is the dumbest idea had. Just keep your head down. [chatter] [music playing] Mickey, I think I just pooped my pants. You're shitting me. No, I'm shitting me. We might have to wash you off. [music playing] [laughing] We shouldn't have ran like that. Yeah, you're right. How about I pull a "U-ey" and turn around right here? (CHUCKLING) Come on, get out of here. I'm not doing that. Well, you could have gotten caught. [sighs] I got your meds. Get used to it. Come on, that was fun. That's nothing compared to running away from Mr. "Butt-ko-bich" Last period study hall, he carries around a 2-by-4 as a paddle. I'm not kidding ya. It hurts, too. [laughing] Left cheek was stinging for a while. [laughing] This is the make, model, and license plate number of the car. Thank you, ma'am. We get calls like this all the time. I'm sure it's gonna turn out to be nothing. When I called the school, they said both of my boys were absent yesterday. The car is missing. And my handicapped son doesn't have his medication. Does that sounds like nothing to you? No, ma'am. I'm just trying to... My son has bronchitis and a weak respiratory system. It could be pneumonia. I understand. We just have to eliminate all other possibilities before we conclude that this is a case of runaways. Runaways? I'm sorry. I know it's difficult for you, but I... My boys wouldn't. They just wouldn't. All right. I'm gonna call this in. I'm sure they're gonna be fine. [music playing] [sniffles] [sniffles] [sniffles] [music intensifies] Mickey. Oh, my god. Mickey. Mickey, left. [tires squealing] [car horn] [spitting] I just got dirt in my mouth. That was a close one. [sighs] I guess, um... I guess we know what (CHUCKLING) Evel Knievel feels like. That's not funny. We should pull over. You need to get some sleep. No, You gotta get going. Or we could get something to eat. There's got to be a diner somewhere. [sighs] [starts ignition] Roger, I'm sorry. [MUSIC - SPIRIT, "I GOT A LINE ON YOU"] Let me take you, baby, down to the river bed. Got to tell you something, go right to your head. I got a line on you, baby I got a line on you, babe. I got a line on you, I got a line on you, babe. Gotta put your arms around me with every bit of your love. If you know what to do, I will make love to you. 'Cause you got the right line to make it through these times. I, I got a line. I got a line on you, babe. There's a three-shake limit. Can I get a little more, please? Since when do you drink coffee? Since about 30 minutes ago. Coffee refills are free, especially for you. [chuckles] Uh, thank you. 14. [rings bell] Oh, no, Mickey. Clemente got number 2,998. He only needs two more. At this rate, the only way we'll see him do it is if he goes hitless in Philly tomorrow. 21. [rings bell] That means we can reach the home game back in Pittsburgh on Friday. I never thought I'd have to say this, but we gotta root against them. Yeah. Yeah, we have to. Otherwise, it's over. And $2.50 is your change. Thank you very much. You're welcome. ROGER STRAKA: Mickey. Yeah? Got California plates, 90265 on Interstate 62 at a hotel diner. [music playing] Do you have a backdoor here? (WHISPERING) It's right over there. Thank you. Rog. Get back. I know. Just relax, OK, Rog? Another brilliant idea, Mickey. MICKEY STRAKA: Yeah. [laughs] Hey, kid, can you give me a hand over here? MICKEY STRAKA: Uh, OK. Mickey? Mickey? Mickey. [rattling] Mickey. [chuckling] You boys is runaways, ain't ya? We're on our way to Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh? 'The hell you want to do in Pittsburgh? We're gonna see Clemente. The ballplayer? So why you got the fuzz chasing ya? You're coming with me. [grunts] What are you doing? MICKEY STRAKA: Help. Where's Mickey? Where's my brother? MICKEY STRAKA: Help. What's going on? Roger. [grunting] Get in there. Mighty big reward for runaways. [banging] Somebody get us out of here, anyone! [music playing] Please, help us. [banging] ROGER STRAKA: Think, Mickey. MICKEY STRAKA: We need a plan, we need a plan. ROGER STRAKA: My plan is to get the hell out of this trunk so we can call Mom to come and get us. MICKEY STRAKA: Ah, think, Mickey, think. [police siren] Wait. Do you hear that? [police siren] The police. ROGER STRAKA: Yeah, the police. MICKEY STRAKA: All right, all right. Listen to me, Rog. When the car stops and you hear the cop's footsteps, just scream your head off, OK? [police siren passing by] ROGER STRAKA: Mickey, they didn't stop. MICKEY STRAKA: Son of a... now what do we do? [music playing] Get out. I can't. Get out. Don't be trying to run off. Whatever you do, can you just not hurt him? [scoffs] Do I look like some kind of killer to you? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Look. I'm sorry for locking you boys up in the trunk, all right? It's just I ain't got me much money. And, well, I figured there might be some kind of reward for runaways, if you know what I'm saying. [train horn] They pay rewards for fugitives, not runaways. What you talking about? Yeah, fugitives. [coughing] Actually, you could be charged with kidnapping for throwing us in the trunk. (CHUCKLING) You're kidding me. Well Hell, I ain't trying to kidnap ya. Hey, you got a train station here? Yeah, about three miles. I tell you what. You drive us to that train station, and we'll forget all about it. Get in the car. GRANDPA STRAKA (ON PHONE): Hello? Poppy, it's me. I'm about to board. I'm coming to Pittsburgh. They found the car outside of Oklahoma City. Mickey and Roger miss you, Poppy. They're headed for Pittsburgh. What? I don't follow. If they call, I'm going to be there. GRANDPA STRAKA (ON PHONE): Be careful. [train crossing bells] [train horn] [train horn] [brakes screeching] [music playing] Can I help you? This train going to Pittsburgh? That's a freight train going straight to St. Louis. I got another train, a passenger train, going to New York, but it stops in Pittsburgh in about 45 minutes. How much for two tickets? $55. All right. We'll take two tickets. Uh, we changed our minds. Ho... hold on one second. What are you doing? Mickey, we only have $14.21. Where's the rest of the I put it in the car so it wouldn't get stolen. You're kidding me, right? [coughing] You OK? Yeah, I'm fine. You know, everything was in that car... our clothes, the maps, my wheelchair. We're screwed. Let's just jump the train. It'll take us to St. Louis, and we won't have to pay anything. We're that much closer to Pittsburgh. Jump the train. (SARCASTIC) Yeah, right. I'm serious. They do it in cowboy movies all the time. (SARCASTIC) Oh, if they do it in cowboy movies, that means we should. Only orphans jump trains, Roger. [laughing] All right. [grunts] Bun boy. [train horn] Mickey, my crutches. Oh, shit. [grunts] [train horn] Come on, Mickey, hurry up. [train horn] [panting] [music playing] Come on, run. [panting] Come on. Run, Mickey. [grunts] What are you doing? Just grab the ledge. The ledge, come on. Do it. [groaning] Thanks a lot, man. That was a close one. Thanks. Get back from the door, or we'll get busted. [coughing] [train horn] [coughing] You still collect those things? Isn't that for kids? They're... they're not mine. My brother's. Something my dad left behind. Where'd he go? I don't know. Your old man left your mother, too? Yeah, so what's... what's your name? Hey. I mean, we're, uh... we're friendly asking questions here, right? Marilyn. But everybody calls me Kelly. Marilyn's my mom's name. Well, everybody's got a mother, don't they? Mine just... mine just marries dirty, old men. I haven't seen her since I ran away over a year ago. She must be really worried. [chuckles] Doubt it. MICKEY STRAKA, YOUNG (VOICEOVER): "For all the wonderful things Clemente could do on the field, it was never about his celebrity. A reporter once told him he was a shoo-in to get 3,000 hits." Uh, you never know. I... in my whole life, like I said before, you never know, because they don't tell you how long you're gonna be here. So you never know what could happen tomorrow. MICKEY STRAKA (VOICEOVER): At that point, I was starting to think Roger was right. Clemente was only two hits away. And some guys get three hits in one game. And we still had a long way to go. [airplane ambience] ROGER STRAKA: [coughing] Hey. This is the last place you should be. Rub my chest. What? [labored breathing] He's OK. He just had a little coughing fit. Mhm. [pills rattling] This will make you feel better. You feel better? [bells ringing] What are you waiting for? This is where we get off. [train horn] Listen. When we jump, it's probably better if we go our own ways. OK. [grunts] [train horn] I don't know, Mickey. Maybe it's just me, but this doesn't look like St. Louis. Where's the arch? Can't believe you let her take your Pirates cap. You going soft on me, bun boy? [music playing] MICKEY STRAKA (VOICEOVER): By the end of day two, our perfectly-laid plan was falling apart. And Rog was right. We weren't in St. Louis. We were in Alabama... Birmingham, Alabama. It was midnight, and not exactly the friendliest part of town. And then we stumbled upon about the only place open that late at night. [MUSIC - AMERICA, "A HORSE WITH NO NAME"] So what, they just leave their door open in the middle of the night? It's a mission, Mickey. SONG LYRICS: On the first part of the journey, I was looking at all the life. There were plants and birds and rocks and things. There was sand and hills and things. [dialing rotary phone] [dial tone] GRANDPA STRAKA (ON PHONE): Hello? Hello, Poppy? GRANDPA STRAKA (ON PHONE): Mickey. Mickey? is that you? What have you done? I am out of my mind here worried to death. How's Roger? He has bronchitis. He needs his meds. Mom, put Poppy back on the phone, please. Mom's there? MARILYN STRAKA (ON PHONE): Where are you? Call her back. No. I'm serious. Call her back. No, I'm not calling her back. What? Call her back. Hey, do you want to talk to her? Here. [dialing rotary phone] [phone ringing] Mickey! Hey, Poppy. GRANDPA STRAKA (ON PHONE): Roger boy? Yeah. Yeah, it's me. GRANDPA STRAKA (ON PHONE): You OK? I'm OK. GRANDPA STRAKA (ON PHONE): Can I speak to Mickey? Yeah, he's right here. It's Poppy. [sighs] Hello? You forget everything I teach you? Why do you hang up on your mother? She's worried about you. Oh, she's worried about me? GRANDPA STRAKA (ON PHONE): Where are you? I'm in Birmingham. I'm near the train station. Where's that? It's in Alabama. Can you come pick us up, Poppy? I can't. I'm an old man. Listen to me. Your mother is on the way to the airport right now. You meet her at the train station. [speaking polish] Yes, sir. [sighs] What'd Poppy say? Is he gonna help us out? DJ (ON RADIO): And in sports, the big news is out of Philadelphia tonight. Roberto Clemente stepped up to the plate in the top of the sixth and hit a liner to right-center for hit number 2,999, just one shy of the magic number. And in a gesture to his hometown fans, Clemente pulled himself from the lineup, hoping to hit number 3,000 tomorrow night in Pittsburgh in front of a hometown crowd. Did you hear that? We can still make it. It's over, Rog. Are you high? We're less than 600 miles away. We're in a makeshift church with absolutely no way of getting anywhere. We have no car. We have no money. And on top of that, Mom's coming to get us, not Poppy. [music playing] I can't believe you're giving up. I'm not giving up. Mom says you have bronchitis. Yeah, it's a lung infection. I get them all the time. I can take my medicine. So? So? So if I would have known that you had bronchitis, I never would've taken you on this trip. Yeah, and I gotta get out of this chair and run home. You and I both know I'm not getting any better, Mickey. See, in some ways, I'm kind of like Clemente, too. He's 38, and it's late in his career. He only has so many at bats left. Well, my playing days aren't gonna last forever, either. What do you mean, Rog? Come on, Mickey, can we just... Why... why did we even go on this anyway? Mickey, you were right. After thinking about it, I realized that I might never get to see Pittsburgh again. I mean, what if this is the last time I ever get to see Clemente, or just take a trip? What if this is the last time we ever do something fun together? Don't say that. Look at me. It's true. God, I hate these things. I just hate this. Mom's gonna be here in a while. And we're gonna get you back to your doctors. I don't want to go back to California. We've come too far. We can still do this. You know we can. [coughing] Are you OK, son? Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. Thank you. We... we just stopped in. It was a little cold outside. If there's anything else you need, I'll be in back. Yeah, thank you. Thanks. TRAIN STATION CLERK (ON INTERCOM): Last call [inaudible]. Last call [inaudible]. Mickey. Oh, there you are. Where's your... sorry. I thought you were someone else. (SIGHING) Oh, God. Excuse me. Have you seen two boys around here? Uh, teenagers. The younger one's in a wheelchair. They're my sons. So you're Marilyn. How do you know my name? I met them. They told me about you. Good. Well, I'm here to pick them up. Well, they're not here. You just told me they were. No, I said that I met them. But that was on the train. On the train? Did they get back on a train? We hopped the freight train together from Oklahoma. But they're long gone now. On foot, I guess. [sighs] I talked to them tonight. They were supposed to wait for me here. Well, they're not here. How you doing, Rog? [panting] I can't take this. You OK? Yeah. You all right? My legs ache. What are you doing? I'm taking these off. [bus accelerating] Hold on one second, Rog. I'll... I'll be right back, all right? [grunting] MICKEY STRAKA (VOICEOVER): I don't think Rog knew it at the time, but after he threw down his braces, he would never walk again. He forced me to come along, Mom/ Honest, I tried to talk him out of it. [coughing] Easy there, bun boy. Shut up, jerk weed. [distant motors] Hear that? [revving motors] Uh-oh. This can't be good. [music playing] ROGER STRAKA: [coughing] [revving motors] [turning motors off] What do we got here? What are you boys doing out here in the middle of the night? Looking for a ride to Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh? You are hell and gone from Pittsburgh, boy. Well, you gotta start somewhere. We ain't getting any closer rapping with you. How long you been in the wheels, kid? Longer than you'd like to know. What, are you some kind of comedian, son? Well, I wanted to be a stand-up comic, but life dealt me a cruel blow. [laughing] I like this kid, man. I like this kid. He's funny. He's got big ones. BIKER: Heck, yeah. He cracks me up. I'll tell you what, shortstop. We'll take you as far as the Tennessee border. Right on. Sidecar. SIDECAR: Yeah. Kid rides with you, Jumbo. [STARTING IGNITIONS, REVVING MOTORS] [MUSIC - THE ALLMAN BROTHERS BAND, "STATESBORO BLUES"] Wake up, Mama. Turn your lamp down low. Wake up, Mama. Turn your lamp down low. You got no nerve, baby, to turn Uncle John from your door. Thanks, guys. Take it easy. [inaudible], kids. Thank you. All right, come on, Rog. Yeehaw! [accelerating] We're gonna sleep in a barn? What if someone's home? MICKEY STRAKA (VOICEOVER): We were dead tired and needed some rest. Thanks to Clemente, we had gained an extra day and could afford to take a night's sleep. [rooster crowing] [cows mooing] [chickens clucking] [horse nickering] [pig grunting] [gasps] Bet you didn't know I was from New Orleans. [music playing] [inaudible] My mother and I were having dinner with him one night in Butte. You know me, I said too much over cocktails. The next thing I know, [laughs] got the account. [laughing] Are you boys brothers? Uh, yes, sir. Well, my name's Chuck, Chuck Ireland, like the country. I'm Mickey. This is Roger. Hi, Mickey. Hi, Roger. Glad to make your acquaintance. Are you boys hungry? [sizzling] [scraping] [coughing] Kitchen's this way, buster. That's not for sale. That's Stan "The Man" Musial, you know? Far out. How'd you get this? Eh, that was a long time ago. Now, the spitter, I never liked that. Never did. You know, it's bush league. You know, bush league. Know what I mean? Bush. Bush. "Buuuush." Bush. Bush. "Buuuush." "Buuuuuush!" [laughing] Your Clemente, now, there's a rare bird, see. Years ago, the old Forbes Field... you ever see a game in Forbes Field? [coughing] Yeah, we used to... The Pirates were playing the Cardinals, see. And there's this foul ball that goes into their lawn there, the stands along the right field line. And Clemente, he... he can't quite reach it, you know. And this man, he... he caught it, you know. He felt all good and fuzzy and happy, you know. And then this really big, burly guy next to him reaches over and wrestles it away from him. So between innings, Clemente, he comes over. And he gives the man another ball. Up until that day, Stan "The Man" had always been me and my mom's favorite player. But after that, no ballplayer meant more to us than Clemente. Nobody. [music playing] You boys know how lucky you are to be going to that game tonight? It... it's what baseball's all about, being a part of history. Makes me miss my mom. (GIGGLING) Isn't it silly, a grown man crying over his mom? So how you boys fixin' on getting there? She'll get ya there. I... I don't know what to say. We can pay you. Back. We can pay you back, as soon as we get to Pittsburgh. [coughing] Don't go insulting old Chuck Ireland, now. I don't want no money. Besides, you couldn't afford it, anyway. Never had me a brother. You can get there in about 10 hours. Don't you let him push her too hard. [echoing footsteps] [music playing] [labored coughing] We should get you to a doctor. ROGER STRAKA: [coughing] [coughing] I'm scared, Mickey. Try long, long, slow, deep breaths, OK, Rog? [coughing] I'm trying to find a place right now. [coughing] [sniffling] Mickey, it's never been like this before. It's 'cause you gotta sit up. Don't nod off, OK? Sit up, deep breaths. Long, deep breaths. [coughing] Do you know where a hospital is? Yeah. [inaudible] your right. Just down the street and then that way? [car horn] [accelerating] [brakes screeching] What's going on? Hurry. Let's get him in. [grunts] He's never been like this before. (PANICKED) Just don't let him die. All right, calm down. Tell me what's wrong. He, um... he's got MD, bronchitis, a weak... Respiratory system? Yeah. Yeah, it's typical with MD. Um, he started off on antibiotics. And then... then we started this trip. And then... [panting] (WHISPERING) Please don't let him die. All right, nurse, uh, check his pulse and get an IV ready, please. What's your name? Mickey. This is... this is my brother, Roger. All right, Mickey, well, you did the right thing. All right, we're gonna take care of your brother. So I suggest that you step out into our waiting room. I'd rather stay here. Mickey, go to the waiting room, please. OK? OK, Roger, we're gonna take care of you, all right? Feel better. How is he? [sighs deeply] Your brother's a pretty tough kid, do you know that? He didn't die, did he? No. No, he's not gonna die. He's dehydrated and hypoxic, which means he doesn't have enough oxygen in his blood. He's got an elevated white count and bronchitis, which you already knew. MD's a real bummer, you know? Yeah. I think he'll turn it around this time, but I don't know how many more of these he can take. Can I see him? He's sleeping now. He needs to stay here until morning. So I heard you came all the way out here from California to see Clemente get his hit. Not the best idea to bring along your little brother. You know, my mom is still mad at me for dragging my little brother with me to Woodstock. What the hell did I know? It's against protocol, but why don't you go ahead and crash here. There's an old TV in your brother's room. We can get you a roll-away. I'll be in to check on him. What's your name? Um, you know, they call me Dr. Marcus. My friends call me Boogie. Thanks, Boogie. Uh-huh. [chuckles] [music playing] You thought I was gonna die, didn't you? Bun boy. Yeah, me too. Where are we? We're in Steubenville, Ohio. 39 miles away. Yeah. What time is it? It's about 5:30. In the evening? Well, we can still make the game. Nah, you're too sick right now, buddy. If you're better tomorrow, you can go home. It's OK, we got a TV here. We were so close. Yeah. Not bad for a guy with a learner's permit and a kid in a wheelchair, huh? You go. What? You go to the game. No, I ain't... There's no sense in both of us missing the game. I didn't get stuck in a garbage can for nothing. If you go, that's good enough for me. I could represent both of us. Yeah. Are you sure? Sure, I'm sure. We did it, Rog. We made it. ROGER STRAKA: Yeah. We made it. [rainfall] ANNOUNCER 1 (ON RADIO): Tarp's still on the field, but it looks like it's clearing up. ANNOUNCER 2 (ON RADIO): Yeah, well, with Clemente's 3,000th hit on the line, no one is leaving this park. ANNOUNCER 1 (ON RADIO): Yeah, they're determined. They're gonna stick around to see if The Great One hits the big one. [thunder] Mickey, what are you doing? What's wrong? They're not gonna call the game on account of rain. Not with number 3,000 about to happen. You didn't come back for my umbrella, did you? I risked everything for this trip. I just never should have done that. I risked your life and freaked out Mom. It was just stupid. That doctor was wrong. This is my fault. No, it's not, Mickey. It was my choice, too. But you could have told me that after the game. I couldn't go to the game. Not without you. Either we see it together, or we don't see it at all. I'm sorry, Rog. You know I never really cared if we made it to the game. At least, not at first. I came on this trip because I wanted things to be like they used to be back in the Burgh, before we moved to California. It's been the best three days of my life. Me, too, Rog. How's this? ROGER STRAKA: Yeah. Yeah, that's perfect. [static] ANNOUNCER 3 (ON TV): I don't think I ever... This is ridiculous. [static] ANNOUNCER 3 (ON TV): ...World... [static] ...him up there at the... [static] I guess you have to stand. You gotta be kidding me. This is how I have to watch the game? 3,000 miles for this? ANNOUNCER 3 (ON TV): They want him to get it. And Tom doesn't want him to get it. The look over to first. The pitch. And Bobby hits the first [inaudible] [crowd erupts] Oh, and the crowd [inaudible]. Yeah! [coughing] He hit it! 3,000. [coughing] We... we did it, Mick. He did it. He got 3,000. We saw it. Oh, wait, Mickey. Oh. Oh, no. [chuckling] Oh, crap. Boogie's gonna be pissed. [coughing] Who the hell's Boogie? I think you are deserving of a Clark Bar, a celebratory Clark Bar. [tapping] A 3,000-hit Clark Bar. Aw, no way. SPORTSCASTER (ON TV): ...folks. Oh, so close. Oh, that's the last straw. Unbelievable. SPORTSCASTER (ON TV): But in the end, the scorer gives him away. I can't even watch. That's ridiculous. SPORTSCASTER (ON TV): Here's how it all went down. Clemente hits a shot up the middle. It goes off the pitcher, but is ruled a hit, number 3,000 for Clemente. Then, unbelievably, the scorer changes his ruling, putting the genie back in the bottle just when we thought our wishes had been granted. Clemente robbed of 3,000 for today. What? They ruled it an error? They said it wasn't a hit? SPORTSCASTER (ON TV): So it comes down to the Pirates, Mets, tomorrow afternoon, Three Rivers. Last game of the year for the Pirates. One more shot at history for Clemente. Come on, let's call Poppy. [starts ignition] [music playing] Bet there's some scalpers out on Forbes Avenue today. What the hell's wrong with you? You got rocks in your head? What's the matter with you, huh? Forbes Avenue. Do you have any idea what your mother is going through? Yeah, I know. No, you don't. She's worried sick right now. Why'd you run away after all she's done for you and your brother? We didn't run away, Poppy. We just wanted to see Clemente get his hit. I can't explain it, but we just wanted to be a part of it. You know, when your father left, I tried. It wasn't easy, but I tried to be there for your mom and you. But it's not the same. There's a lot I don't know growing up in the old country. But there's something I do know. There's nothing that means more to me and your mother than the two of you. Both of you. How are you, Roger? I feel good, Poppy. It's good to see you. What about you, knucklehead? Yeah, I'm OK. Good. Thought I might take you to my favorite hot dog place. The Dirty O's? Oh, I miss their cheese corndogs. Hey, you know what? They got a TV there. We could watch the game. I was thinking of something a little better than that. We can go to the game? Poppy, you're the greatest. The old Slovak comes out of the bullpen. (LAUGHING) Yeah. [laughing] Wait, he's only batting .250 in his last 10 games. I mean, what if... No. We didn't drive 2,000-something odd miles to see him go hitless, Rog. Clemente don't go hitless. I promise you, this game, he's gonna hit the ball. 3,000, I guarantee it. [music playing on radio] DJ (ON RADIO): And that's the latest on KPLW, Pittsburgh's finest. We'll be going to the stadium next for our first live report on today's game. Roberto Clemente will try once again for number 3,000 here in the last game of the season. Will he get it? I hope You're gonna be there. Clemente. DJ (ON RADIO): And in other news, the [inaudible] Country Fair goes through tomorrow night at 6:00 PM. [echoing footsteps] [music playing] [crowd cheering] MICKEY STRAKA (VOICEOVER): Poppy was right. There's no way Clemente wasn't going to get his 3,000th hit that day. We had come too far. I see you, Roberto. I see you. I feel like I'm right down there with him. MICKEY STRAKA (VOICEOVER): We became a part of history that day. But the best part was that, once again, it was Rog and me back in the Burgh watching a Pirates game. ANNOUNCER 4 (ON RADIO): Strike called on the outside corner at the knees. Matlack on the 0 and 1. [crack of the bat] Bobby has done it. [crowd erupts] [inaudible] [cheering] [fireworks] A double for Roberto. That's a ballplayer, huh? Wow. Thanks, Poppy. [shouting, cheering] MICKEY STRAKA (VOICEOVER): And after the game, there was one last bit of unresolved business. [music playing] You will never know how much you mean to me. Told ya it wasn't just another '70s story. Dad, why didn't you ever tell us about the trio before? A little obvious, duh. I didn't want you two getting any ideas. You know, I never knew the last week of the '72 season was so awesome. Awesome? It was awesome, all right. And Uncle Roger? He was too much. Uncle Roger. [music playing] Hey, Uncle Rog. Hi, sweetheart. Ah, a Clemente jersey. Nice. Is this your first game at the new park? Check this out. Hey. I've been waiting so long, I almost put out a tin cup. [laughs] Sorry. We got stuck in traffic. Uncle Rog, Dad got pulled over by the Police. Now... Uh, driving never was your strong suit. Yeah, he's right. You're more of a train hopper. Ohh. So you finally told them? Well... Grandma must've killed you. Chuck Ireland. That's right. [laughs] I haven't thought of old Chuck in years. Didn't you? Bush! Bush! Bush! Bush! Bush! [laughter] Hey, Dad, you think we can get the tickets early? Go and meet you at the seats, if that's cool? That's cool. That's cool. All right. All right, cool. Come on, Maddy, let's go. I got a book for you to read. Roger. Check it out. You gotta be kidding me. I've been looking for this book for years. Gets better with each read. Thanks. STADIUM STAFF 1: Program, program, get your program. You know, you're looking pretty good for someone who wasn't supposed to make it to graduation. Oh, doctors. Never underestimate the love of a mother. Or a brother. My fingers are tired. Why don't you push me? STADIUM ANNOUNCER (ON INTERCOM): Welcome to PNC Park. I'd love to.
