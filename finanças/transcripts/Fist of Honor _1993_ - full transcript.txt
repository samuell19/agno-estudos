[MUSIC PLAYING] I told you the bitch was no good. This is not smart, Tommy. I know how you feel. But, but the truce is what-- it's almost-- only two hours away. The Maluccis and the Diamonds finally reached an agreement. You know Uncle Dino would not like this. Don't worry about Uncle Dino, huh. He'd do the same if it were him. Come on, you're crazy. Don't worry about it! You're going to screw up this truce, that's what you're going to do. Hi, Johnny. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] Boy, I'm gonna love this. Boom! Right to the moon, Alice! Maybe we should check with Uncle Dino first. Hey what's with you and Uncle Dino, huh? With all due respect. Maybe it's not his fault. Maybe it's hers. You know, Lips? You're right. [WOMAN GASPS] What the fuck? Oh, Rosie, am I too late for the party? Hello, Tommy. Hey, Casanova. Where are you going? C'mere. Tommy, be cool. Don't worry, I'm cool. Johnny Malucci, I'd like you to meet my husband, Tommy Bones. Tommy Diamond?! Of the-- of the Diamonds?! That's me, baby. In the flesh. Don't worry, Johnny. He won't kill you. There's a lot of things he can't do and pull his trigger is one of them. Oh what, am I'm married to comedian over here? Huh? Johnny M., what would you do to a guy if you found him in bed with your wife, huh? What would you do? What would you do?! Hey, I ain't married, all right? Come on, I ain't got all night over here, Johnny, I'm hungry. I want to go get some dinner. What would you do? What would you do?! I'd blow his head off. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] Not me. [GUNSHOT] [WOMAN CRIES OUT] [GUNSHOT] Hey Tommy, you're crazy! [GUNSHOT] Johnny, come back here. I ain't got no beef with you. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] [EXPLOSION] Hell of a way to start a truce. Ain't it, though? [JAZZY MUSIC] (SINGING) "L" is for the way you look at me. "O" is for the only one I see. "V" is very, very extraordinary. "E" is even more than anyone that you adore. And love is all that I can give to you. Love is more than just a game for two. Two in love can make it. Take my heart but please don't break it. Love was made for me and you. [JAZZY MUSIC] (SINGING) is for the way you look-- you're looking at me. And "O" is for the only one I see. "V" is very, very extraordinary. Now "E" is even more than any, any, anyone that you adore. And love is all I'm gonna give to you. Oh, love is more than just a game for two. Two in love can make it. Take my heart but please don't you break it cuz love was made for me and you. I said that love was made for me and you. Don't you know that love was made for me and you. [APPLAUSE] Scusi. [JAZZ MUSIC] BOBBY: Louie! LOUIE: Hey, buongiorno, Bobby. Try some of these cannelloni. Eh? All right. TOMMY: Oh, Vinnie! What do we got? Come on over here. I love this. C'mere, Vinnie, what do we have? Oh, Thomas, this is the sauce for tonight. Taste this. - I love this. Is it good? You make the greatest. Oh Jimmy! This guy makes the greatest sauce. Yeah, he's terrific. Tell Uncle Dino it was true. And I took care of everything. I took care of "everything." OK? Stay here. I'm home. [JAZZ MUSIC] [WHISPERING] What took you so long? You missed dinner. I got a call before I left. Cousin Johnny was murdered a half an hour ago. Tommy Bones' wife was found dead in Johnny's apartment. On the night of our truce Dino has to draw blood at the last minute. Adultery should not have a place in our business. You couldn't wait one more hour. You're going to have to answer for Johnny Malucci. Johnny? I don't understand, I didn't order anything. I just found out, boss. It was Tommy Bones. Seems like his wife wasn't boning Bones, she was boning Johnny. Well where's Tommy now? We saw him in the kitchen. It's great, man. I'm telling you, gotta get me this recipe. I will, I will. Hey, Uncle Dino. This sauce is great, man. Why don't you tell him to give me the recipe, huh? Tommy, you broke the truce. You made a big mistake when you killed Johnny Malucci. Scumbag deserved it. Don't worry about it. Guy was banging my wife, what was I supposed to do? Sit down and do a rosary with him or something? You're going to have to face the consequences. Look, Dino, what are you going to do to me, huh? Are you going to shoot me or something? Huh? Are you going to kill me, Uncle Dino? What? No. He is. [GUNSHOTS] I sincerely hope you'll accept my apology. Absolutely. Let's cut the cake. VICTOR: This is the beginning of a new beginning. The Malucci family and the Diamond family have always had their differences. But tonight, we come in friendship to raise our glass and equally divide our city. As our agreement, I equally divide our city in half. [OMINOUS MUSIC] Cen'tanni. Buona fortuna. Buona fortuna. What does buona fortuna mean? It means good fortune. That's nice. It's nice it it lasts. Look at them. See how Dino holds that knife? He's just dying to stick it in Malucci and gut him like a sea bass. That was my last number. I'm really tired. Can we go home now? Sure, baby. Let me finish my beer and we'll be outta here. DINO: And now, ladies and gentlemen, since we have nothing to fight about anymore the Diamonds would like to challenge the Maluccis, one on one, just for the sake of the action. [CHEERS] We never talk about a challenge. Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, well you can always refuse. No, no. We accept. BOBBY: Hey, Fist. Dino wants you. Sorry, Bobby, we were just leaving. Fine, you can tell that to Dino because I'm not gonna. Colum, are we gonna go, or are you going to stay here? FIST: Baby, I gotta see what Mr. Diamond wants. I'll be right back. Jackson. I told you I need you tonight. Let's fight. You got it, Sammy. No problem. DINO: Ladies and gentlemen, all bets that are handled, even money across the board. To my left, representing the Diamond family, a one-time heavy weight contender and three time Golden Glove champ, Colum "Fist" Sullivan. [APPLAUSE] To my right, of the South Side of the train tracks representing the Malucci family, and one-time heavyweight contender, Jackson Spikes. One black guy in the whole joint and it's Malucci's boy. He's a member of the Malucci family. FRANKIE: What was that? What'd you say, Tucchi? I said which Malucci is he related to? Is that your mother's side of the family, or your father's? FRANKIE: Hey, uh, hey Tucchi, what part of Italy is the Irishman from? Hey, at least he can ride in front of the bus, you understand. [LAUGHTER] You know something, Tucchi? You got a big, big mouth, you fat bastard. Marone, Frankie Pop just called Tucchi fat. Fat. Think he's going to shoot him? I think he's gonna shoot him. All right. Know what I'm gonna do? I'm going to put up 5 grand on my brother. - Your brother? - Yeah. Make it 10 grand, prick. Go ahead. Make it 10 and I won't kill you. Hey, all right. Go ahead. Put it up, let me see your money. Come on, you fat bastard. Let me see the money. Anthony, give me the-- where's the roll? Hey, Anthony. Anthony! BOBBY: Think they bought it? DINO: Are you kidding? I don't think that they ever saw a man get shot before. When I shook hands with him he was trembling. Eh, that Tommy Bones, I never liked him anyway. He always thought he'd make a great sacrificial lamb. Come on. Now for sure they'll believe the truce. And when the time is right? He's a dead man. I don't want half the cake. I want the whole cake. [CHEERING] Come on, hit him for christ-- hit him! [INTENSE MUSIC] Thataway, Fist. Combination! [EXCITING MUSIC] Yeah! [EXCITING MUSIC] DINO: Come on! Come on! Hit him! Nail him, nail him! [CHEERS] Come on! Get up. Get up! [EXCITING MUSIC] Come on, Fist. Finish him! He's finished! He ain't getting up. What do you mean, ain't getting up? He ain't getting up. Go ahead, show him your piece. [SINISTER MUSIC] [YELLING] Dino! Dino! Here's your boy, Dino. Right here! [INTENSE MUSIC] TUCCHI: Beautiful, Fist! Beautiful! My champ! My champ! [APPLAUSE] Get up, will ya please? That fucking nigger just cost me 10 grand. You did it! You did it! Fist! C'mere! C'mere! You did good! You did good. My champ, my champ! I love this guy. I love this guy! GINA: Now hold it there for 5 minutes. FIST: It's cold. GINA: It should be cold, it's ice. Thanks. Now, you should thank me. I'm always here to pick up the pieces for you. Someday I'm not going to be here, then what are you going to do? Why do you do this for them? I got a real job with them, I flight for fun. Oh, this looks like real fun. And it's not a real job. Some guy doesn't pay for Dino, so you go and hit him? I never hit anybody unless they hit me. 'Scuse me. You borrow money from a bank, you got to pay it back, right? Go ahead, rationalize. If you don't pay it back they send some bank guy out. He calls you 10 times a day, he threatens to take your car, your home, threatens your family. It causes some people jump off of a building. Me? I think a few pops in the old bread basket is better than taking a big leap. So you consider yourself a banker. No. No, I know what I am. I just want you to think of me as a banker so we can stop all this nonsense. I'm a fighter. It's all I know is fighting. My daddy told the neighbors not when I took my first steps but when I threw my first punch. I think I caught him with a right while he was burping me. [CHUCKLES] So on the outside I'm tough. But the inside I'm just toasted marshmallows. That's why I love you so much. I just don't want those insides to turn to steel. [ROMANTIC MUSIC] GINA: Colum? FIST: Mm hmm? GINA: Are you asleep? There's somewhere staring at us out on the fire escape. Oh don't worry. That's that little girl I told you about upstairs, Alex. I'll be right back. I'll get my pants. Hey. Alex. Can't you sleep? Will you teach me how to fight? Not tonight. Ooh, ooh. Where'd you get that? Where'd you get yours? Fighting. Me too. I'm going to teach you to defend yourself. But not tonight. Well will you teach me better than you so I don't end up with another black eye like you? I'm going to teach you better than me. When I learn good, I'm going to beat up my stepfather when he hits me and my mom. Are you my friend? What do you think, huh? What do you think? You know I'm your friend. Are you mine? Always, Fist. You don't mind if I call you Fist, do you? Nah. I'm proud, coming from you. Now I want you to relax, I want you to get up there, and I want you to get some rest. 'Cause all good fighters have to have his-- her-- her rest. Good night. Gimme this, right here. Come on. Come on. Growl. Eh, come on, eh. Good. Get off me. Go home. You're gonna make such a good father some day. Just hope you live to be one. I don't want you end up dead in an alley some night. I won't. I'm Irish. They'd never let me get that close. Guys like me and Jackson Spikes were hired muscle. We're safe. We're not important. They won't hurt us. [GLASS SHATTERING] Oh, Jackson, Jackson. You really disappointed me. I'm sorry. I did my best. I did my best. You best wasn't good enough. [OMINOUS MUSIC] [GUNSHOT] Let's go get this piece of shit. FIST: Tight fist. That's it, that's it. Good. Good. Tight fist. Go ahead. Relax your shoulder. Good, good. OK one more big one. Pop it in there. Yeah! He's down, he's down. That's great. That's a great first day. Don't we get to drink raw eggs now? Raw eggs? I hate raw eggs. But I will scramble you some up. But not raw. Naw, I'm not hungry. But I'll watch. Let's go. Hup, hup, what, hup, here he comes in for the [INAUDIBLE] First a little cooking music. You're so funny. I know. Who's in here? [INAUDIBLE] OK. My grandma used to make a clown face on my grapefruit. She'd do it with a little strawberry, and little orange slices. She'd say, "if food is fun then the kids will always eat." You know what? I'm not my grandma. My stepfather's awake. I guess you got to go, huh? Yeah. I guess so. One day I'm going to take that cane and I'm gonna whack him in the head with it. You better call me first before you do that. Will I see you tomorrow morning? Yeah. You'll see me. I'll be right here. You call me if you need anything. Go on. Get out of here. VICTOR: My doctor says these are fattening. I say, I pay you lots of money. I don't want to hear no shit what I can't eat. You don't want to eat salami, a cup of Cola? Then charge more and tell me it's good for me. SAMMY: Dad, he was just telling you that so you can stick around for a couple of years. Your grandfather, may he rest in peace. I know. He used to have a cognac and a cigar for breakfast. Every day. And salami at night. Not at night, right at bedtime. He hid it in his nightstand. Oh, the room smelled beautiful. When he died your grandmother-- I know, Pop. She left it up there with a loaf of bread for 10 years hoping he would come back for a slice. Now that's love. Relax for a little while, OK? I'll see ya tonight. How you doing, Victor? Hello, Victor. I understand you wanted to see us. Yeah. I just wanted to make sure that everyone knows that we gave our word. I want this truce with the Diamonds to last. Even if they push a little, I want no action. I want it To last for Sammy's sake. I want things to be easier for him when I'm gone. Whatever you say, Victor. Yeah, Yeah, Sure, Victor. You ain't going to get any trouble from us. [OPERATIC MUSIC] Morning, Mr. Diamond. You were great last night, Fist. Made us look strong. I just don't like hurting people, Mr. Diamond. Well, a man's got to do what he's good at. I mean, that's the way God wants it. That's why he makes you good at what you do. Short list today. Keep an eye on that Paul Glowacki. He's behind six months and he's talking shit. And tell that football coach, that Jenkins this is his last chance. He's in this for 50 grand. What a loser. He doesn't even know what his own team's going to win. Oh, how's Gina? She's fine, she's just fine. I don't know what that beautiful Italian girl sees in that jerk. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] Hee-yah! [LAUGHING] BOBBY: So I'm minding my own business, right? And I'm putting pepperonis on half the pizza, you know? I mean I'm 14 years old and the same size I am now. So this nigger junky comes in and the guy pulls out a blade, right? And he doesn't say anything. He's like Helen Keller, this black mute, right? He's standing there staring at me, spaced out, not doing nothing. So I figure the guy's gotta to be on Mars before breakfast. So I say, OK, I'm going to start a conversation, right? So I say, look, you don't need a knife, what are you doing? We sell pizza by the slice. [CHUCKLES] BOBBY: Nothing, right? He's still doing Helen Keller, like you. [LAUGHTER] BOBBY: OK, so I'm thinking, what the hell is this guy going to do? So I said, OK, he's not going to make a move, so I'm gonna make a move. Bang. Two ladels of Fra Diavolo marinara right in his eyes, jump on a table, whack the knife out of his hand with a 10-slice metal pizza tray. Bang! Over the head with a cast iron Sicilian pizza tray. He goes down. By the time the cops come up, I'm like stuffing calzones in his throat, you know what I mean? I mean, 15 years later, the coroner is still pumping the [INAUDIBLE] out of this nigger prick's belly. Hey, Johnson, how are you doing? All right? One of these days, Bobby. DINO: One of these days you will be dead. And they'll have to pay for another cop's children's college. [LAUGHING] All right, come on, come on. What do you got for me? You truce with Malucci has the brass more concerned than when you people were killing each other. They are all second guessing. No one knows what to expect. Well what the hell is there to expect? Except peace and harmony? If something were to happen to break that truce, I'm going to have to have a fall guy, someone responsible for the action. I understand. Now this is what I want you to do for me. I want you to keep me informed of all the Malucci action. God forbid anything should happen to the truce, I'll give you a Barabbas. OK, guys, listen up! 20 high steps, right now. Let's go. Let's go [SHOUTING IN UNISON] Hey who the hell are you? Name's Sullivan. Mr. Diamond sent me. Hey listen, I told your boss I never wanted to see you guys around here, and I mean it. Coach, I can't leave here empty handed. Evidently you don't understand what I said. This is my field. And I want you off my field. You hear what I said? Get off my field, man. [INTENSE MUSIC] COACH: That's enough. OK come on, get out of here. Come on. Out. Out. GINA: How's it going? Come on in. I can't give you boxing lessons, but I sure can give you makeup lessons. Is your name Glowacki? What? No, no, no. I'm not him. Try him over there. Mr. Glowacki. Dave, Dave Glowacki. Who wants to know? Name's Sullivan. I represent Diamond collection. All right, tough guy, what do you want? You gonna break my bones? You gonna cut my throat? You bring your pocketful of nickels? Oh yeah, I heard about you guys. I paid the loan. The interest is too high. And my brother, he agrees with me. So here's a message to take back to that wop son of a bitch. Hit him, Nicky! Hit him! Come on, Nick! All right, come on! Hey, Dave. I work for Mr. Diamond and you and I talked. And you're going to pay $2,000 a week. At the end of the month, you're going to come up with an additional $20 grand. If you don't do either of these two things he's got to send somebody else. Believe me, you'd rather be dealing with me. GINA: Keep your eyes shut. I want to see. No, not yet. Keep them shut. OK. Now look. I never thought I could be so pretty. Is that why Fist love you, because you're pretty? I hope it's more than that. Here you go, Jimmy. It's from the Polish guy, the uh... Glowacki. Yeah. He's going to be fine, but the football coach didn't work out. That's OK, you did good. Forget about that football guy. We'll see you tomorrow. Load up, Bobby. We're gonna teach this coach some new plays. Why does Fist always get beat up? Believe it or not, Fist always wins. You should see the other guy. Now he gets beat up. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] Hey. We thought you might want to share some of the money you collected from Pablo. I don't think that's a good idea. See, the money belongs to Mr. Dino Diamond. Screw Mr. Dino Diamond. [MENACING MUSIC] All right, all right. Leave this chump alone. All right, man. Look at that green. Nice job. How much you got there, man? [ROUSING MUSIC] [WHISTLE BLOWING] OK, second session now. Let's go, let's go. Like the fourth quarter, boys. [OMINOUS MUSIC] [COUNTING IN UNISON] Everybody outta here! Let's go! Everybody. Come on, come on. Let's go. No time left on the clock. OK. [MELANCHOLY MUSIC] FRANKIE POP: Victor ain't gonna make a fucking move. EDDIE THE ZIPPER: The cocksuckers are happy with the truce. FRANKIE POP: No sense of competition. EDDIE THE ZIPPER: No sense. So what do you want from me? FRANKIE POP: A favor for a favor. Malucci's got Sammy in line. DINO: That's the way it should be. He ain't going to make a move either. Worser than the old man. Much worse. This is why we, Frankie Pop-- And Eddie the Zipper can make things happen. Happen for who? FRANKIE POP: For a man as loyal as Dino Diamond. I'm listening. The truce ain't broken. Nothing happens. Nothing happens. Nothing. But if the truce is broken, without a victim knowing about it, somebody is bound to retaliate. I'm still listening. All right, this is what we gonna do. We're going to step in Bobby Underly's turf, as if Victor gave the order. We'll take Victor out to dinner one night, you tell your man to prepare to strike back. The truce has been broken, and you kill Victor. We take out that piece of shit Sammy, too. And for this, we take one third of the city. We give you two. That's a generous offer. Why are you doing this? For years they've been buying second homes and driving around in fancy cars. We do all the humping. They get all the benefits. Gentlemen, you've got a deal. My first present will be Victor's car for your loyalty. [CHUCKLING] DINO: You can consider that a gift from me to you, for your loyalty. Nice, Dino. Thank you, Dino. Grazie. Saluti. Monte is the name, three card Monte. Pick a card, any card. $10 a card. If my whore don't bring in no dough, I have to. How about that one? Not-- [HORN HONKING, ENGINE REVVING] Oh shit.

Come on, Fist! Pull me up. I don't have any money. Give me something. Pull me up, just pull me up. I don't have any money. I don't -- [SCREAMING] FIST: Give me something now. Fist! I don't have any money. Pull me up, Fist. Pull me up, Fist. OK! OK, I got a couple hundred. Next week maybe more. Now pull me up, Fist. Now you're being smart. BOBBY: So Waiting this guy, right? I hit him with two ladles of my Fra Diavolo right in the eyes. I whacked the knife from his hand with a 10-slice metal pizza tray, bang over the head with a cast iron Sicilian pizza tray and one, two, three calzones down the shoot. Oh! [LAUGHTER] Good, I'm glad somebody laughs. So what do you want? A dime on the Giants minus three, Broncos plus six, right? You got it, Bob. What the fuck. You scare my business away, huh?

OK, then I have no reason to leave my corner. What is this, all right? I didn't invite him. I try to be nice. Didn't I try to be nice? Didn't I? Maybe you on my corner for a little while is OK but I can't have you and Frankie Pop at the same time. [OMINOUS MUSIC] Hey, green eyes. This does not concern you. Oh yeah? Two guys beating up on one little guy does concern me. This is business, Sullivan. Now you stay out of the dirty end. You always been a clean kid, I like that. Don't get involved. I'm only for what's fair, Zip. Forget it, Irishman. Didn't your father never tell ya nothing's fair? Naw, I never knew my father. See? That ain't fair. [LAUGHING] GINA: Look, Dino, I'm asking you for old times. I love the guy. I don't want to see him get hurt. DINO: You know, you had everything with me. Tell the truth. Why did you break my heart? Dino, nobody breaks your heart. [LAUGHING] Oh, I should have married you when I had the chance. Do I still have a chance? You never had a chance. The Italian girl in love with the mick. All right, let's say that I do you this favor. I'm not saying that I will, but let's say I do. What is in it for me? Bobby! What happened? What the hell is going on? Eddie Z. and Frankie Pop. But I didn't leave my corner, Dino. - Dino, they're on of line. - All right, all right. Relax. Take it easy. Maybe it was just a misunderstanding. FIST: Gina, what are you doing here?

[GRUNTING] DINO: You know Melucci's like Columbus, he couldn't read a map either. [CHUCKLES] Yeah, Columbus discovered America because of his inaccuracy. Malucci is going to lose his life for his. This is the opening that I've been waiting for. GINA: You don't understand. I grew up with these guys. They're very dangerous. I don't want you around them. They're reasonable men. You heard Dino. Yeah, I heard Dino. I also know Dino. How well do you know Dino? Well enough not to trust him. You ever do anything with him? Nothing happened. Nothing. When? First you say nothing, now you say when.

You ready for a surprise? Hmm? [WATER FLOWING] Sorry about that. I don't have a checking account but it's all there. What kind of work are you in, Mr. Sullivan? He is a banker. A banker. Without a checking account. The world is a colorful place, isn't it. When you plan on breaking ground? Oh, as soon as we get our next 50 grand. Enjoy Enjoy. It's a pleasure meeting you, Mrs. Fist. Um, not yet. But soon. Very soon, soon. Where's the kitchen gonna be? Are you gonna cook? No. I want to put one of those plant windows in there. Well whatever my hands can build for you, I'm gonna give it to you. We're gonna put a fireplace right here, and it's gonna be on both sides of the room. Where's the bedroom gonna be? Bedroom's gonna be right there. No, I think the bedroom should be right over there. That way we can get the sunrise in the morning. You can wake up every day with a mile. Right there? If we build it there then we can watch the sunset from our bed. No, I think we should watch the sunset from our pool. Our pool? Yeah, we gotta have a pool. FIST: Gotta have a pool? Gotta have a pool. GINA: I don't need rooms, or a pool. If you pitched a tent right here, I'd be the happiest woman in the world. As long as I'd be with you. Well, a tent and a pool, then. Gotta have a pool. Gotta have a pool. Baby, just one more year. We'll get all this Dino garbage behind us. OK? Promise? I promise. GINA: [SINGING] Let's start over. Let's meet again. Let's pretend that it's a different end. Let's start again. DETECTIVE JOHNSON: Hey, Jimmy. I'm not here cleaning your change from the streets. Now you listen. DINO: No, you listen. You work for me, your work for my men. My men are the extension of my arm and you show them respect the way you show me respect. Are you listening? I'm listening. You got something to say, say it. You don't got nothing to say, then get the hell out of here. DETECTIVE JOHNSON: Malucci was liked. Someone has to answer for it. I'm here for an answer. Are you saying I'm not liked? DETECTIVE JOHNSON: I didn't say that. Then what are you saying? DETECTIVE JOHNSON: I'm saying Malucci rid of drugs in the school yards. He cleaned this neighborhood up so good you can eat off the damn pavement. He coached Little League, gave to the VFW post. His hands were dirty clean. Now you broke the truce in the worst way. I need a body. I'll take it, Dino. What am I gonna do, 5 maybe? I'll take it. Step inside. No, no Jimmy. I need you with me. GINA: [SINGING] Let's meet again. Let's pretend -- I give you that Irish guy, Fist Sullivan. It look better if he was Italian. But I don't give a rat's ass if he's Chinese. Just give me someone with a murder weapon. When? Tonight. Get Johnny to take Fist over to the warehouse. Tell him we have a challenger from a group of wise guys from Vegas. They've questioned our strength and I'm calling on him to defend the family honor. But the other men think it's a regular fight. You know, the less people know, the better. During the fight Tucchi will go to Fist's apartment, plant the evidence, and then you call me. By the time Fist gets home, he will be in handcuffs. That son of a bitch. [MENACING MUSIC] Hello, Gina. Your timing was always perfect. Why Colum? Why not some other punk? Maybe this was Dino's way of getting you back. Colum is not going to go to jail. I'm going to tell the whole world about Dino Diamond and his dead bodies. I'm sorry, Gina. I can't give you that chance. What, is this all he's got? Come on, come on, come on. [FIGHTING, SHOUTING] [GUNSHOT] WISE GUY: That's it, pay it up, come on. DINO: Hey, Tuch. Tuch, come on. You all right? Hey. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You all right? You did good. You did good, Tuch. I'm proud of you. I mean you did what had to be done. What the hell, I should have had her killed a long time ago. You know what I'm saying? Huh? You all right? Hey, congratulations, Fist. DINO: You were great, kid. The fight was great. Because you're a champ. You're the best. Oh! And this is for you. That's what I call an honest day's pay. Go ahead, go home, get some rest. You deserve it. Thanks, Mr. Diamond. [POLICE SIREN] [POLICE RADIOS] [OMINOUS MUSIC] DETECTIVE JOHNSON: Mr. Sullivan. You are under arrest for the murders of Eddie Falcone, Salvador Tacchi, Anthony Torga, Frankie Pop, Victor Malucci, and Gina Bacchi. Cuff him. POLICE OFFICER: All right, Fist. Put'em behind your back. Hold it, you son of a bitch! Colum "Fist" Sullivan, you have the right to an attorney. You have the right to keep your drunken Irish mouth shut. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. I love these cases. Open and shut. If you can't afford an attorney, one will be provided to you by our generous state. FIST: Gina. Gina. [GENTLE CLASSICAL MUSIC] WAITER: Padrone, [INAUDIBLE] paella for you. Mangia. Ooh, [SPEAKING ITALIAN] Boss, this chef make this just for you. Come on, mangia. Please. Mangia. Hey, Tuch. What's the matter? Your jaw hurting? You can't eat solid food? [MUMBLES INCOMPREHENSIBLY] What? What? [MUMBLES] I'm only kidding., I am only kidding. Listen. Look at it this way. Figure you're on a diet. You're too fat anyway, you should lose some weight. [LAUGHTER] Now what's happening? Word on the street is nothing. Nothing. I don't like nothing. Nah, they're not gonna retaliate. I've known Sammy since he was in diapers. He ain't no threat. He still wets his bed. WAITER: Come on, mangiata, please, mangiata. So what do we do? We wait on Sammy. Oh, hey Tuch? Aren't you gonna eat something? [LAUGHING] [OMINOUS MUSIC] [INMATES YELLING] [SHOUTING INCOHERENTLY] Back up! INMATE: [THREATENINGLY] Step in, come on! Step in, esse! Like a kid's first day in school, you have to answer the class bully. That's our bully. [INMATES LAUGHING, TAUNTING] Hey! Hey! Hey, hey, shit motherfuck-- If we strike back now, there'll be an all out war. The city and the rest of the families will blame us. I'd like to advise against any retaliation. - LOUIE: It was our move that triggered the attack. Eddie the Zipper, that scumbag, should have never moved on Diamond turf. If he didn't, your father would still be alive . LOUIE: But Eddie did. And your father Victor Malucci is dead. We played right in the Dino Diamond's hands. It's clear now. That assassination of Tommy Bones to call it even was just a move to get us to trust him. He's praying we make a mistake. And we did. So what do you want to do? What have you learned? That moulinyan, Johnson, who just happens to be in Diamond's coat pocket, he arrested that Irish fighter. Colum "Fist" Sullivan. He charged him with the murder of your father and his girlfriend, Gina Bacchi. They found her dead in his own apartment. Didn't that used to be Dino's girl, no? Years ago. She was about 15. But that only lasted a couple of years. Then Dino brought Sullivan around. Three months later, she's in love. It's an obvious setup. Fist was always clean. Never got his hands dirty. Did you know him? A little bit. From the old gym. We'd talk. Boss. What do you want to do? Let's get a message to Sullivan. Tell him we know who killed his girl. You get an attorney on the case. Use someone from outside the family. I don't care what it costs. I want you to get him out of prison as quick as he went in. And when you bring him out you bring him right to me. Together, Sammy Malucci and Colum Sullivan will avenge the death of their loved ones. The way a man kills is the way a man should be killed. With fists and fire. It was too easy last time. So we decided to double our odds. [INMATES TAUNTING] LOUIE: Fist. How ya doing. FIST: Doing great, Louie. LOUIE: I'm sorry. FIST: Yeah me too. LOUIE: Listen. Sammy wants to talk to you. FIST: Nah. I don't want to get involved. You're already involved. Now Sammy is fair. He just wants justice for him and for you. Now listen to me. You're going to be out by morning. Our L have already arranged it. So Louie, what's this going to cost me, another five years in my life in some jail on the outside? Just a meeting. That's all you owe Sammy Malucci. If you don't like what he has to say, he'll walk you to the door. Yeah. Good. Hi, friend. Hey, friend. You sleeping OK? Yeah, I know. It hurts. I miss Gina. I saw him. I'm sorry. I'm getting outta here tomorrow. You want to help me out? SAMMY: Fist. My father, although he chose this business, he was always a fair man. Can I get you another drink? FIST: Sure. Thank you. The press loved my father. The authorities needed a diamond in the rough to avoid bad press and an all out war. Me. Being Irish, and expendable, Dino through you to the sharks. Why Gina? An accident? Jealousy? You know that had a past. Yeah. They may have had a past, but Dino and I, we got a future. We both have an interest in Mr. Diamond. FIST: All I need to know is who killed Gina. That's it. I'll tell you what. I'll set up a match with the Diamond family. You be my fighter. When the time is right, I'll take out Dino, and you'll get your killer. For this service I'll pay you $250,000. You got a deal. Mr. Sullivan, I think it would be safer if you stayed here. No, I got a few things I gotta do. Thanks, Sammy. OK. Louie, this is going to take some time. Get me Angelo. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] I was on the fire escape. He was laughing. He put a-- he put a piece of metal on that fit onto his knuckles. He kept hitting her. Hitting her. I should have done something. Screamed, anything. FIST: No. I couldn't move. FIST: It's OK. If you'd tried anything he would have killed you, too. I couldn't do anything. Well, now you can do something. You come with me. And you show me this, this person who killed her. You point him out to me. Can you do that? Will you do that? [SOBBING] [OMINOUS MUSIC] FIST: You OK? ALEX: Yeah. Alex, let's get the hell out of here. I'm taking you to a safe place. [SINGING IN ITALIAN] What do ya say? Ashes. Good. I'll be able to sleep tonight. Listen. Get me a fighter. The young Mr. Malucci wants to settle things the way they started. Our warehouse. One on one. Just for the action. We're onlye going to get one chance at this. We must be precise, we must be accurate. We'll be at Dino Diamond's warehouse. His men know every inch of the place. When I give you the head move, you fly back behind his men, take care of what has to be taken care of there, and that night we'll avenge the death of my father. I understand, boss. [OMINOUS MUSIC] DINO: How about a drink to start off the festivities? No thanks. I'm really not thirsty. Let's start. Oh ho ho ho. A real businessman. Maybe we could learn something. Nah, nah. Come on. Let's go, let's go. SAMMY: Here's half a million. And total control of the city for five years. You can refuse. No, no. Let's play. The only thing is I hope and pray that you got yourself a good fighter. Because if you don't, you're going to be out of business for five years. SAMMY: What's the matter, Dino? You look like you just saw a friendly ghost. Hello, Mr. Diamond. Fist. You look good. All right, Bobby. Bring in our guy. [SNAPS] BOBBY: Let's go. DINO: Come on. Give them the rules. All right. You guys know the rules, right? There aren't any. Anything shy of bullets goes. I want you guys to do the best you can stay in the building. The man alive at the end, he wins. All right, let's start. Yeah! SAMMY: Thatta boy, hit him! Come on! Come on! Get up, get up. What the hell is this? Hey, what is this? BOBBY: Dino Diamond. It's time to answer for my father. Tucchi. You want a job? Got to go with the winning team. What do you need, boss? Get me a chair. The rest you can split this up. Just walk out quietly. Take a five year vacation. And remember, the Maluccis believe in sharing their wealth. Tie him up. I shoulda known. I shoulda known. Surrounded by idiots. I don't like explosions, Dino. I like a slow burn. In the name of my father, Victor Michael Malucci, I send you back to your maker. DINO: What are you talking about? Where you sent him. It's done. TUCCHI: Nice work, boss. I couldn't have done it better myself. FIST: That's right, Tucchi. You'd rather kill women. It was you. Oh, it was you, Tucchi. Sammy, you believe this guy? It was you. Wasn't it. Admit it. I'll give the order. I did it. I did it. Sullivan. He's all yours. This one's for Gina. SAMMY: Goodbye, Tuch. Well. Think we'll have it ready by supper? Kitchen plant box and pool or I'm not your friend. [JAZZY MUSIC] [SINGING] "L" is for the way you look at me. "O" is for the only one I see. "V" Is very, very extraordinary.
