-Oh? Yeah? -Oh. -Oh. -Hm. -Mmmm. -Hallo, hallo, hallo, hallo. Really glad you could come on such short notice, by the way. -No problem. I'm excited to see it. -Yeah. So, we don't know how long she's been exposed to the outside air... - Okay. -But locals found her about four days ago. They thought it was recent 'cause it's so well preserved. Oh, watch your step here. Oh, I believe you know Lennard. -Hi, Lennard. Good to see you again. - Good to see you. - Is Radu around? - Yeah, he's around somewhere. - Good. -I can't say what an honor it is... -What is going on with that? I saw it on the way in. Unfortunately, they found the man who was digging in his own pit this morning. - Dead? - Hm-mm. Yeah, they say he died of hypothermia. A heart attack, resulting from hypothermia. That's terrible. And the pit? -Well, we're not allowed to check it out yet. -Oh, of course. -Shall we? So, we've tried to protect the site from the elements as well as we could. I hope it's satisfactory. -Yeah, okay. Okay. Sorry. Sorry. That is incredible. Look at that. Isn't she beautiful? Mum. Hey! Mum. Hey. -Nee. Mama. Mama. Mama. Wat? -Sir, can I help you? Yes, yes. -We had someone walking around the house this morning. - One of ours? -What he's trying to say is that the next time something like this happens, this person will probably not receive a very warm welcome. -Ah, okay. So that's what he's saying? -Something like that. -Mooi. So... listen. I'm sorry that this happened. I will make sure to tell my crew not to go exploring on their own. Okay? -Are you guys digging for treasure? -Yeah. Something like that. -Ja. -Ja? Okay. I have another one. When, after the plane is landed, and people jump out of their seats, grabbing their luggage, like they're in a terrible hurry. But then, of course, the doors don't open until 15 minutes later. And they all stand there, just cramped together in the aisle like a bunch of idiots. I fucking hate that. That's a good one. Yeah, that's a good one. -Thanks. No worries. -Shouldn't you join them again? -Nah, we're doing fine. I could just sit here and exude authority. - Okay. - Yeah. -Yeah. Oh, what about people who take everything that's even remotely considered free? -Okay. -You know, like, um... ah, like those bags of sugar. They-they don't need them, but they take them anyway. Is this about your mother again? -Oh, my God. She is terrible! She collects those things like a hamster. Yeah, and when we have guests, she presents them with this whole array of sugar bags which she stole. Wow. - Yeah, she gets under my skin. - Uh-huh. -As your local guide, I would advise you to try the... Witte Koppenjenever next. It's absolutely delicious. -Oh, um, I'm pretty sure I had several of those already and I'm not sure that I can sit here and exude authority... I think I'm getting a bit too relaxed... Men who keep their socks on in bed. -Socks, yeah. Bloody philistines. You know what? I think I have to call it a day. -Are you okay? Ah, for helvede! What have you done to me? -Don't fight it. Lovely. Yeah, we would just drive and play gigs everywhere. Sometimes for like five people, but that was fine too, you know? Does your daughter remember it? No, but she likes his voice. I played her some songs of us in the car. He had a very beautiful singing voice. So does she, actually. -No chest pains, no fatigue, no nothing? -No. -His heart just said fuck it. No more oxygen for this asshole. How's the head? -Trying to avoid sudden movements. You know, I am usually better at handling hard liquor. - Yeah. - I'm Danish and all. -Of course. Of course. There must be like a million guys out there waiting for a chance to make you happy. Well, I'm sorry to inform you that I'm not really considered relationship material around here. -Come on. -No, seriously. They're all afraid. Family curse. - Family curse? - Yeah. -'Cause your husband died? -Yeah, that... and some other stuff. It's a boring story. -Nutshell. -Well, my grandmother was murdered when I was a kid and they never found out who did it. Wow. -My dad went a bit crazy after that, started drinking, lost his job. My mum became emotionally unavailable. And nowadays, she's suffering from this mysterious illness nobody really seems to know how to deal with. I escaped it all for a while when I went to New York. But then Neil died, leaving me with this little firecracker called Hanna. -Jesus. That sounds like a... a proper curse. -Yeah. Doesn't it? -This is me. Well, thank you for telling me all of this before we spend a whole evening together. Well, usually, it takes a little bit longer for disaster to strike, so... I'll stay out of your way. -Yes, please. -I'll see you around. -Ja? -Oké. -Mama! -Oké. - Mama? - Uh-huh. -Ja. Wel... -I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I took some of your milk. -That's okay. -Just, uh... Just wait here. Okay? -Please. Please. -I'm sorry. I'm sorry. They're making me do it. -Go away. Please. -Mama! Hi. -Hi. Again, I'm so sorry to hear what happened. It's unbelievable. Known the guy for ages. He wouldn't hurt a fly. The whole crew liked him. I don't know what could've gotten into him. -They understand. It's not your fault. You couldn't have known. This man, I'd say he's no older than 40, 45 maybe. -Yeah. -So, in 1991... he would have been 10, 15. -Yeah. And living in Romania. -Can we talk? Upstairs? Boy, you're pretty brave coming here. See how we're super cursed? It's pretty obvious, huh? -Hey. Hey. -Come here. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. -Just a minute. -Hey. -I'm here with my mum. - Okay. - You are going to see that man. -Uh, Radu? - Hmm. - Yeah. -Did they say anything about why he could have done it? -No. Well, he hasn't woken up yet, so... - At camp, they were saying, uh... - Betriek! -What? -Um, they were saying that he was digging. -Digging? -On his own. Away from the site. Such a strange coincidence, right? Betriek! -What are you doing tomorrow? Hey, right on time. -Not this place again. -Bad memories? Do you see the old man sitting over there? - Who? - Him. His son was the guy who died in the bar a couple of days ago. Just after he dug something up. What was it? What was it? -A woman. - A woman? - No, sorry. A very old... very old woman. Hundreds of years. A bog body. -How old, exactly? -We're still running tests. But old. What? -Come. I'm not sure that I understand correctly. But are you saying that your son knew where to dig to find this woman? - Cheers. - Cheers -We are a very sensitive family. My father, me, but especially Micha. He always know things. -So, could it be that it was whispered to him? Where to dig? -Eh... Helen's whispers. She talks about this. The legend... of Feike. Yeah. Excuse me. -What's going on? Uh, s-sorry. So, who's Helen? I can't believe you don't know. -What? -You science boys, you're uninformed. Come on. -He's sort of the villain in this whole legend of Feike, like there's something evil out there in the bog, whispering horrible things to anyone who listens. It's a stupid story... just to scare kids away from the bog. -Like a boogie man? -Yeah. Some people take it pretty seriously, though. You'll see. Oh, we have our annual celebration in a few days and it's... including the school musical, it's ridiculous. -And do you? - What? - Take it seriously. -No. I hate the story. My dad said he heard it once. The whispers. Actually, I think I heard it, too. In the hospital. What? -What do you want me to say? I mean, come on. -Nothing. Just say nothing. Just tell me about this woman you guys are digging up. - I want to know. - No. I'm not gonna tell you anything if it makes you all paranoid and weird. -What... Sorry, paranoid? -Yeah. -A guy came into my house, where I live, where my family lives. He tried to kill us, and then he got his brains bashed in, in front of me. - I know. -Yeah, so don't... -Don't what? -Don't treat me like a nutcase. -That's not what I'm doing. You're traumatized, and it may have altered your perception of things, that's all I'm saying. - Fuck you. - What do you mean, fuck you? -Fuck... Fuck you. Stop the car. Stop the fucking car! Betriek. Betriek! Where are you going? Betriek. Betriek! - No! We need to go back to the camp. -Yeah, fuck off! You're drunk! I didn't mean it that way. Please, come on. Come on. Come on, we need to turn back, please. Come on. I can't leave you here! Come on. Just stop, please. -Ah, ah! -You think it's funny? -Yes. Jonas! Where have you been? I've been trying to reach you. Let's get inside. It's not going to work. -Her throat has been cut. -Yes. Just like the others. -There are more? Four, to be precise. All women. That's amazing. -Their throats have all been cut vertically? As far as we can tell. -These were found in the new holes, the ones that Radu dug. -You're kidding me. -Wait with the press statement until we find out more, yeah? - Sure. - And, Sonja... could you look something up for me? -Ja. Wat? -Uh? -Here it is. The legend of Feike. Many centuries ago, there was an evil lord, Walter, and his bitter wife, Helen, who treated their people poorly and lived in tremendous wealth whilst others were left to struggle. Together, they commanded a household with dozens of servants. One of them was a young girl called Feike. It wasn't long before Walter started developing lustful feelings for the girl. Eventually, the worst happened. Feike got pregnant. When Helen found out, there was no shelter from her fury. "It wasn't him!" she screamed. "He was under a spell, taken over by her heathen mind." And so Feike was named a sorceress. A witch. Awaiting her fate in the dungeon, she prayed to God for help. But it was a different god who listened, a heathen god, Moloch. The god of child sacrifice. "I will help you escape a fate unworthy of a soul so beautiful, my child," the god whispered. "But beware, this vengeance will become a cage of its own and I will claim what's mine... Your offspring, even those yet unborn." And thus, a deal was made and sealed with the mark of Moloch burned into the girl's forehead. The next day, Feike stood at the stake. "Repent!" the mistress shrieked. "Confess your guilt and repent," she insisted. "Repent!" she repeated for the third time. But Feike courageously answered, "No. It is you who shall repent." She freed her hand, and before anyone could act... she cut her own throat. As Feike's last breath left her body, Helen's wretched soul was evicted from hers. From that moment on, Helen's living and breathing flesh would belong to Feike. As the lord's wife, she exercised her influence over his rulings. Before long, happiness and prosperity had returned. To this day, Feike is celebrated as a true heroine and a beacon of light. -She cut her own throat? -Yes. -Vertically. -Um, it doesn't say. -Hallo? -Yeah. Hi. It's... It's Jonas. Hi. -Hi. I was wondering, am I gonna see you at the Feike party tonight? -Yeah, uh... I'll be there a bit later. Around 8. I can't come right now. There's something I have to do. -Hey, I, uh... could you call me back? Where is she? Hey. He went to the party, I think. Hey. Jonas! Jonas! - What else did she say? - I don't know. She seemed really distraught about the situation. She's really lucky she didn't damage anything. I-I was extremely nice to her, mind you. -She's been through a lot. -Yeah, I know, with the attack and all. -It's not just that. Her husband died, grandmother was murdered, and now the old... - Her grandmother was murdered? - Yeah. Uh... - You're not gonna tell me somebody slit her throat, are you? -Why would you say that? - Holy shit. Did someone... - I don't know. -Do you think it's still happening? -What? -The sacrifices. She was rambling something about her family being in danger. Is that why she freaked out? They're still... They're still sacrificing people to this god? Moloch? Are you okay? I'm sorry. I got carried away. This is ridiculous. -Can I borrow your car? -I came by foot. Why? -I need to go. -You're going? W-Why? -Sorry. -Jonas! Nee! Mum. Fuck! Mum? No! -Police, please. Hello? Betriek. Betriek. -Thank you for meeting me here. I'm only in Holland for a day, so... Yeah, it's been crazy. -It's nice. - Yeah? - What is it? -It's the guesthouse. Yeah, it came with the place, so... But it's not... It's not getting much use. -It's nice. -If you want, you and Hanna are more than welcome to come and stay. I can imagine the both of you could use some time away from here, change of scenery. You could bring your violin. Uh... maybe record an album or two. Thank you. -No. I sold it. -You sold it? -Yeah. I think it's best to have some stability now, you know? Stick to the familiar with Hanna. -Yeah, yeah. Of course. I understand. How is she doing? She's plowing through. -Glad to see that both of you are coping so well. -Yeah. -Yeah. You probably should talk to someone as well. I mean, professional. -Well, I have my mantra, and it seems to work. I don't know how to translate. It's, uh, something like... "Just keep going." Yeah. Blik op oneindig. -Well, it sounds like a good mantra. -Yeah, works for me. What's yours? -Uh, I don't know. I'm having trouble focusing lately, if I'm being honest. - Oh. - Yeah. Tomorrow they have scheduled a lecture for me in Paris, so... I'm in trouble. Yeah. -Well, I'm sure you'll be fine. -Yeah. - So... - So... -Well, it was really nice seeing you again. Hanna! -Okay. Yeah. If you reconsider, please call me, huh? I think it would be good for the both of you. In fact, I would really enjoy the company. -Okay. Stop worrying. Yeah? You look tired. Take care of yourself. -Okay. -We'll be fine. With these things, sometimes it's best to just... leave it be. There's your mantra. -Leave it be. -Yeah. Leave it be. Hanna. -Oh!
