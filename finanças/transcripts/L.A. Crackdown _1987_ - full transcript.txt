[music playing] Shut that god damn radio off. Baby, you got great timing. You should be in a comedy. Did I tell you I'm doing a comedy next? No, you didn't. Yep. I just hung up the phone, and guess who I was talking to. Mr. Jerry Goldstein himself. Do you know who that is? No, who is he? Of course not. How old are you? 16. Jerry Goldstein built this town, honey. He only put the first studio up on Melrose Avenue. He just gave me the green light to go ahead with a $2 million comedy. And you're going to be in it. Me? Now, get that shirt off and let's get to work. What's wrong, Ernie? We'll go for a drink afterwards, OK? Mm, yeah, right. We'll talk about it. Sure. I'm Valentine. Aaron? We're next. Liz, put some make up on this guy. He's all smeared. Ernie, what's wrong? -Nothing. I was just testing. See. Can you do something so my breasts can look bigger? MAN: "Cockodile Dundee," scene 69, take 12. What do I do now? Cut, cut. That was a little awkward. What I want you to do is hold the knife like so and cut her blouse of. If you cut her a bit, don't worry about it. She'll probably love it. You sure she won't mind if I cut her? I don't want you to slash her throat, I just-- this is an S&M flick. You know, a little blood won't hurt. Come on, let's go. Camera ready? Sure you don't mind if I cut you? Make it look real. OK. Roll camera. Police, open up. Oh, shit. It's a raid. All right, they're here. OK, everybody. Stand by, our players are here. Williams? Yes, sir. We'll be listening to you, brother. Let me hear you say those magic words. It's good shit, man. Try it. Hey, Williams. Yes, sir? Be careful. Thank you, sir. He passed us by. Shit. Fuck, he spotted us. God damn it. Well, let's go after him. Maybe he's got the stuff in his car. What if he doesn't? Sit tight. Let's just sit tight. Wait a second. He's turning around. He's turning around. Hello, pigs. Put your hands out. All right, man. You got it. You got it. Now, I want you to do exactly what I tell you. Otherwise your brains are going to be splattered all over the dashboard. You got it, brother. [pounding] All right. Y-90 to Y-91, we're burnt, brother. Operation's a wrap. Meet me back at the station. But sir, the vehicle is still at the shop. Are you deaf, man? I said meet me back at the station, code two. Yes, sir. We'll meet you back at Central. Something must have gone wrong. Let's see it. Where's the money? Hands up. We got the money, let's split. Shut up. What the fuck is this? Man, you just fucked yourself. No, you fucked yourself, Officer William, Officer Warner. What the fuck is this, some kind of joke? Look, we came in here clean, man, just like we talked about. No guns. No guns? You came here clean, you came here to shoot me, you motherfucker, just like you shot my brother. Talk to me, asshole. What the fuck are you dealing with, huh? Huh? You think you're smart? Is this marked money? Is this marked money? Tell me, man. Is this marked money? Talk to me. Talk to me, motherfucker. You want to shoot me, huh? You want to shoot me? I don't-- I don't know what the fuck you're talking about. Where's your wire? We got the money. -Where's your wire? -Shut up. You said you wouldn't hurt anyone. Shut up! I went to you, asshole. I went to you. How many more cops you got around here, huh? How many more cops you got around here, you motherfucker? I don't know what the hell you're talking about, man. [gunshot] Hold it. Did you shoot my brother, Warner? No, I didn't, Speed. OK. You can go. [gunshot] [gunfire] [shouting] [screaming] Wait a minute. He's moving. Die, you son of a bitch. [gunfire] Don't shoot, please! Sit down. Thank you. What, are you a lawyer? No, I'm Karen Shore. I'm with SYO. What? Social Youth Organization. It's a new program designed to help juveniles like yourself. Yeah, and what do you want from me? Why am I still here? You're a three-time offender. Four police officers were murdered. Yeah, but I didn't shoot anyone. No, you didn't. But you finally made it to the big time. That's bullshit. You can't keep me here. I'm only 16. I don't have to listen to you. Sit down. You're not going anyplace until I say so. I don't see you wearing a black robe. You're not a fucking judge. No, I'm not. Have you stopped to think about why you've been here for two days and you haven't been up in front of a judge yet? What are you on, kid? None of your god damn business. I'll see you in a couple of days, if you want to talk to me then. Guard? I want to talk to a lawyer. Sorry, fresh out. Come on. Oh, thank you. You're welcome. And cheers. Well, dinner's just about ready. Did you make a salad? Oh, no. Did you want one? Yeah, I want a salad. I always have salad with chicken. OK, I'll make it. It'll just take a minute. Walt was in the office today. Oh, how's he doing? I don't know. You know, for three solid years, all that guy has done is come in and complain about his wife. I think I'm going to start charging him 200 an hour. You're all hard. What, you don't think I deserve 200 an hour? I didn't say that. Karen? When are you going to go back to school? You aren't going to start that again, are you? Oh, come on. Five short semesters, you can have your Ph.D. Do you know the only difference between your job and mine? What's that? $190 an hour. Aw, shit. Oh. Hi, my name's Lady D. What are you in here for? Hey, what are you here for? Hey! You OK? Yeah. I'm all right. I can't keep her another day. Yes, you can. I already put my ass on the line for keeping her this long. Who's going to know? For starters, the public defenders. They read every arrest report, especially this one, Karen. I should never have gone along with you. Look, I'll take care of the public defender. Who read it? Jamie? Vernon? Come on, tell me. It's not going to work. It will work. Look, she's about ready to break down. If you put her up in front of a judge now, she'll be out by this afternoon. Look, I have a chance to find out where they manufacture the crack. OK, Karen. She's all yours. Thanks. She should have been a lawyer. Where the hell is the sugar? Can I have one? Please? I want some names. I want to know where you got the crack you had at the body shop. I don't know. You're wasting my time. Get the hell out of here. Guard? No, wait. Look. There are 100 guys in every neighborhood that sell crack. I don't know who he bought it from. Speed never got me involved in his buys. Oh, but he got you involved in killing four cops. But I didn't know he was going to kill them. Enough bullshit. Now, I need some names and addresses. I'm telling you the truth. I don't know anything. OK. Guess you're not ready yet. But when you are, I'll be around. Wait a minute. If I tell you some stuff, can you get me out of here? I think so. There's this bar on Sixth Street. Speed used to go, shoot pool, meet a couple of guys. What are their names? Leon was the guy that used to supply the stuff from Nick. And Nick had a couple of girls working the school and Hollywood. Is that how you met Nick? No. I wanted to sell for Nick. But Speed wouldn't let me. We were gonna get married. Where does Leon get the crack? I don't know. Look, I might be able to find out. If you get me out of here, I'll-- I'll take you to the bar. I'll show you the guys. But you've got to get me out of here. Let me see what I can do. And hey, one more thing. There's this girl in my cell, Fiona Washington. She's been in there a while. She was busted on a prostitution charge. Can you help her? I'll talk to you tomorrow. Can I ask you a question? What is it? Well, it's about this kid. She's in trouble. Karen, can I just read tonight? Sure. Go ahead. Fucking touch me again, right, you're dead. You understand me? Now, get the fuck off! Hey, you OK? Yeah, I'm fine. Are you sure you're OK? I'm fine. You think she's gonna get you out? I don't know. She's coming in the morning. What do you think will happen to me? They'll never let you out. You're a murderer. Well, shit, they kept me so far. Tomorrow, you ask to make a phone call. Who am I gonna call? Call that director friend of yours. He's got to be out by now. You know, I should introduce you to him. He pays 150 a day, and all the dope you want. How many movies you made? Three. I couldn't do that. I would be a nervous wreck. There's nothing to it. Now, at first, I was a little nervous, but not anymore. These aren't just fuck films. There's plot and everything. You know, Osgood is gonna do a legit film, a comedy. And he's going to make me the star in it. I'm going to be a major star. You know what happened to one of the girls? One of our movies was on cable late one night, and this big director-- I don't know who it was, but it was someone like Spielberg-- he liked this girl. And he said, find me this girl. And just like that, he put her in his movie. Which one? Well, I don't know her name, but-- No, which movie? It's not out yet. COP: Angie Blake, Fiona Washington, you're out. There are a couple of girls that I'd like to have come and stay with us for a while. So what else is new? Who are they? Angie and Fiona, 16. Kinda had a bad turn. I hear that same line every time you've got somebody you want to bring home here to stay. And you fall for it every time. Couldn't you bring home stray cats instead? Well, I just want them to stay long enough so that I can talk Angie into going back to her foster parents. She's the one that was busted at that shootout where the four officers were killed. Nice. What about the other one? Fiona was busted on a porno set. The county took her away from her parents when some neighbor called the police because of her bruises and welts. Did you know that her father had been sleeping with her since she was 10 years old? Her mother didn't know anything about it, or at least pretended not to. They couldn't keep that son of a bitch in jail for 24 hours. Karen, you're getting emotionally involved in this, aren't you? Yeah. It's hard not to when I see an 11-year-old in a morgue because they were toying with crack. K, K, that's all you talk about anymore. This guy is a wife-beater or this kid is on crack. Can't you do anything else? Talk about your weird Aunt Marie or watch television or make love. We just made love. Uh-uh. I just made love, while you laid there and tried to solve the world's problems. Well, this is it. Nice house. Thanks. You live alone? No, I live with my husband. Is he a cop? No, he's a psychiatrist. Oh. This is cool. Can we play? Of course you can. But first let me show you to your rooms, and you should probably get cleaned up so we can go get some groceries, and then maybe I'll buy you some new clothes. Would you like that? Yeah. [phone ringing] Oh, excuse me. Hello? Yes, Captain. What do you think? Fuck her. Let's hang out for a while, and then we'll split. Sounds good. Everything's all right, Captain. Don't worry. They're not going to steal me blind. OK. All right. Angie? Angie? Get down from there. You're gonna hurt yourself. Where did you get that? From the pool room. OK, we have to get one thing straight. You don't take anything without my permission. Is that understood? Can I have a cigarette? Get inside and get cleaned up. Do we have to do this shit? If you want to eat, you've got to cook. Fucking cop. Hi. Hi. You're cute. I am Paul. I'm Fiona. And this is Angie. Hi. Nice to meet you both. Where's Karen? She's in the shower. Smells good. What's for dinner? Chicken and rice. Good. I'll see you later. See you later. He is cute. He is cute. God. Ah, ah-- we say a prayer before we eat. You want to say it? Sure. Thank you, God, for giving us chicken and rice, and thank you for giving us Paul. He sure is a hunk. Amen. [giggling] Can we eat now? Yes. Watch out. Get out of my way. Yay! Did you want some more coffee? No, thank you. I think I'm going to go play a game of pool with the girls. I haven't shot pool in a while. OK. [music playing] I did it for you. He was a crack dealer. I was trying to help you out. You blew it. Where is it? He didn't give it to me. Trust me. You know, I could have split, but I didn't. You don't do anything unless you ask me first. Do you understand? I said, do you understand? Yeah. Can we watch TV tonight? No, we're going to mass tonight. What? We're going to mass? It'll be good for you. It'll be good for all of us. I'm not Catholic. You don't have to be Catholic to go to mass. Why can't we watch TV? Because you don't get anything from watching TV. But it's not even Sunday. What? They have churches here that are open 24 hours? OK. OK, you have your choice. Either we go to mass, or we read for two hours. Shit, I'm gonna miss "The Love Connection." Benji, with a weariness in her voice that made him forget the pain, did I wake you, Ben said? No. She turned a bit more and then let her head fall back against the pillow. I've just been dozing. Go ahead and read. He moved near-- Nearer. He moved nearer the bed. You're all right, aren't you? Her face looked very small and white, and her body seemed lost in the-- Vastness. Vastness of the bed. Yes, of course, she said. I've just-- I'm just so tired. Paul? Shit. I think we should talk. What do you want to talk about? I don't know what got into me. She-- Yeah, she, she. She's 16 years old, you son of a bitch. She's just a kid. I don't believe this. I can't believe you still defend her. Let me tell you something. She was the one who asked me to bed. In my own house, Paul? While I'm sleeping in the same house? How low can you stoop? I understand you're upset. You know, I ought to arrest you for fucking a minor. What has gotten into you? You know something I've noticed about you? What, that I don't fuck minors? Here we go again. That's great. Every other word out of your mouth is fuck. Come on, Karen. I married an educated lady, a woman who had dreams of becoming a great psychiatrist. I wanted to work with you out of the same office, come home with you, share a little life with you. I did not want to marry a lady who spends all her time with prostitutes and runaways. Oh, don't put them down, Paul. You just slept with one. What is it about all these kids that you keep defending all the time? No one else is going to defend them. They can't afford $200 an hour to get help. Karen. Don't touch me. Don't ever touch me again. You can take your car and your fat savings account and your practice, but when I get back from work tomorrow, you better be gone. Get up, you little slut. I want you out of here. You're going back to your foster parents. No, I'm not. The hell you aren't. You take me there and I'll run away in a week. You run away, and I'll make sure your ass is in the slammer till you're 18 years old. Now, get up. Fiona, we have been worried sick about you. Hi, Martha. Where's Andy? He's inside watching the television. Well, I guess I'll go. If there's anything that you need, just give me a call. Thank you. Did she pick you up whoring in the streets? No. I was making a movie. OK, Miss Movie Star, get your ass inside and start cleaning the bathrooms. [music playing] Angie, where are you going? Get your hands off of me. Angie, don't do this, Angie. Hey! Do me a favor. Do the whole department a favor. Go back to school. Get a waitress job. Do anything, but don't do anything for me. Please, just give me another chance. You are a cop. Why don't you act like one? You come in here, and you tell me some guy took your gun away from you? This is embarrassing. Angie runs away from you. You don't have a clue where the hell they manufacture the crack. Fiona sleeps with your husband? You're a mess. Look, I am sorry. I've got a department to run here. You're going back to uniform. Wallace, don't do this to me. I have to. And what about the times I did come through for you? You have an awfully short memory. [music playing] [muffled argument] What'd he say? Nothing. He's not going to cop out. So what happens now? He walks. He hits the street. Can't you hold him? For what? Possession. Possession? He's got $3 worth of crack on him. Let me investigate him. No. Uh-uh. You know something, Karen? You're going to get your ass killed walking a place like that. Either that or we're going to get sued. What about Angie? Angie who? Oh, Angie. He says he never heard of her. Thanks a lot. Hi. You forget something? No, I came here to see you. What about? You're still in uniform. Just for a while. Can I come in? No. Look, Karen, what happened the other night was not entirely my fault. OK, I had a couple of drinks. One thing led to another. And-- Oh, Paul, don't. Can't you be a man and just take responsibility for your own actions? Karen, I want us to get back, OK? We can start with a vacation. Come on. We can go to Europe. You've always wanted to go to Europe. You can quit your job, or you can keep your job. I don't care. But I never realized how much I loved you until I lost you. It's a temporary feeling. It'll pass. Don't tell me about temporary feelings. I'm the psychiatrist, remember? Oh, and how do you feel about that? Hey, it's your loss. Hey, Fiona, get in the car. Karen, I'm sorry, but I can't take no more of this. She brought three men home last night. And you know Andy's sick. When I told them to leave, they threatened to hurt him. And you know, the $459 just isn't worth it. Get in the car. Bye, Martha. Ooh. Does that hurt? No, I'm all right. OK. Karen, I'm sorry about Paul. I'm not. It was bound to happen. You just kind of hurried up the process a little bit. Listen, let's get some sleep, OK? OK. Karen, I-- I lied. I really didn't fall. I just made a movie. And it was a rape scene. I guess the guys got a little too rough with me. The guys? How many were there? Three. But I wanted them to get rough with me. I wanted the scene to look real. Oh, Fiona, when are you going to realize that you don't have to get beaten up before you make love? But it's the only way I know how. Do you like it? I don't know. Well, it's supposed to feel good. It's supposed to feel better than anything you've ever felt before in your life. But it can only feel that way with the right person. Did you feel that way with Paul? Well, at one time I thought I did, but I'm finding out I wasn't really in love with Paul. Listen, Fiona, you are a beautiful, intelligent girl. It's such a waste for you to go through life without a goal to obtain-- you know, like a good family, kids that you raise and are proud of. What's your goal? My goal? My goal is to have a couple of kids someday, be successful with my job. I'd like to think that I helped one of you kids find a good, happy life. Now, that would be a great success. Well, listen, you better get some sleep, OK? OK. [music playing] Put that down. Put that down too. [phone ringing] Officer Shore. Angie, where the hell are you? OK, wait a second. Let me right that down. OK. OK, just jump in a cab and head straight on over to my place, OK? And promise me you'll do that. OK. What about me? What do I do? You can go. Right. That's right. Hold on a second. Don't you even knock anymore, Karen? I'm sorry, sir, but it's urgent. Let me get back to you, Charles. What is it? I just got a tip from Angie. She came through for me. What kind of tip? Like the address to the warehouse. She said they're shipping out 50 kilos of crack tonight, and it's sitting in a warehouse downtown. I'll be a son of a bitch. Karen, I never thought this kid would come through for us. Look, I'm sorry I was a little hard on you the other day. Thank you. We're wasting time, Captain. [music playing] [sirens] [gunfire] Presents! Oh, good. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Blow out your candles. Make a wish. OK. Here I go. [cheering] Happy birthday, Fiona. Happy birthday. Oh, you guys. How did you know it was my birthday? Easy. I just called "Entertainment Tonight." They know all the stars' birthdays. Oh, really? No, she's just humoring you. Go ahead, cut the cake. Big pieces. OK, real big? Big. OK, OK. I want the red frosting. -The red frosting. -Come on, come on. Cut. -OK, OK, OK, OK. Fiona loved her present. Oh, good. Good. Angie, can I ask you a question? Why'd I come back? Why did you come back? Because I want to get back at Raoul. See, I delivered a suitcase to New York for him. And he said when I got back, he'd give me $5,000. And when I asked him for the money, he just slapped me. I hope he rots in jail. He's not in jail. What? He was in the warehouse with the drugs. Well, we got some of the drugs, but he got away. He's on the street? Yes. Why don't you pick him up? On what charge? It all happened so fast, we can't prove he was there. But believe me, we're all out to get him, and we will. Now, who did you deliver the suitcase to in New York? What, are you a cop 24 hours a day? You're right. I shouldn't be talking about business right now. But first thing in the morning, I want names and addresses. And what about me? I delivered the stuff. Raoul's going to kill me. It'll be OK. I'm just glad you're back. [music playing] Can I take that meat out of the freezer? I want to make meatloaf tonight. Um, you don't have to cook tonight. Why? Are you taking us out? No. No. Angie, we're going to have dinner with your folks tonight. What, you've been talking to my parents? Yeah. Wait a minute. Let me explain. If you don't want me here, I can get out. I can just get my stuff and go. No, Angie. Now, that's not fair. Look, you don't have to go if you don't want to. But I did what I thought was right. You have parents. You can't dismiss that. Who'd you talk to? Both of them. And they love you very much, Angie, and they want to see you. Now look, we don't have to stay. I mean, they invited us to dinner. After dinner, if you don't feel comfortable, then we'll just come back here. OK? It's a deal? How do I look? For the third time, you still look beautiful. I am so nervous. Well, it's only natural. You haven't seen them for over a year. OK. Let's go before I change my mind. I'm sorry we're late, but she's been fixing her hair all day. You look nice, Angie. How have you been doing? Fine. Can we come in? Yes, of course. Your mother's in the kitchen. Thank you very much. Everything was wonderful. I'm glad you liked it. Paula hasn't been feeling well. -Oh, I'm sorry. -No, no. She's fine. Even though she went to the doctor this morning, it's a female complaint. Will you cut it out, Don? I can speak for myself. Angie, go to your room. I said go to your room. I have to speak to Miss Shore privately. I don't know how to start this, Miss Shore. Is it miss or missus? Miss. Angie crashed our car a year ago. It was a hit and run. The family of the boy that was hit, they sued us for all their medical expenses. I know all about that. Look, what I'm trying to say is this. It took us a year to get back on our feet again. I don't know how we can cope with her behavior. But I've had Angie now for a couple of months, and she's really, really trying. She wants to go back to school and graduate, and she wants to get a part-time job. The only thing she needs now is just another chance and a lot of love. Am I missing something here? I mean, are you trying to tell me that you don't want your daughter? Please don't put it that way. We love Angie. Well, what way would you like me to put it? You know how to handle Angie. You've got a special talent with kids. And we want to pay for her board and rent and keep her with you. And do we get to visit on Christmas and other holidays? Miss Shore, please wait. Oh, Don, let her go. Good night, then. Good night. I can't fucking believe it. My own fucking parents don't even want me. Angie, listen to me. I have never been so humiliated in my whole life. Listen to me, Angie. I am through listening to you. Who the fuck do you think you are? I listened to you. I came here, didn't I? I came here with you. Oh, Angie, they want you. Angie, they love you. Who the fuck do you think you are? Who the fuck do they think they are? Who do you think you are? [screaming] Fuck you. Is everything all right? Everything's fine. Just go back in your house. Angie! Angie. FIONA: They had wrapped the-- Untouched. Untouched chicken and the string beans in tin foil. It would be her lunch and was lifting the egg-- Coddler. Coddler. What's an egg coddler? Well, it's a little thing that cooks eggs a certain way. You know, like, you have scrambled eggs and fried eggs? Well, coddled is sort of like poached. Oh, OK. Out of the boiling water, when David came into the kitchen. [phone ringing] Hello? Yes, Captain. Is anything wrong? OK. No, I'll be right down. OK. OK, you can go now. Thank you, Captain. You called for me, sir? Sit down, Karen. It's Angie. She's in the county hospital. Is she hurt? CAPTAIN: She's dead. Oh my god. CAPTAIN: I'm waiting on an autopsy report. I think she OD'ed. How did you find her? CAPTAIN: In the bathroom of Ace's bar. A customer reported it at 6 o'clock this morning. I am sorry, Karen. I know how much she meant to you. We have to notify her parents. What for? Should I say grace? That'd be nice. God bless this house and the food we're about to eat. And please, God, take care of Angie, wherever she is. Amen. That was nice. My mother called me today. Did she? She's divorcing my father. She-- she wants me to move back with her. She just bought a beauty salon, and she said she'd give me a job. How do you feel? I thought I'd give it a shot. Would you come and see me if I go? Of course I will. I'm gonna miss you very much. I'm gonna miss you too. What about your acting? No. I decided that acting's not for me. Good. Here. You better pack these. Thanks. Now remember, you promised me that you'd read for at least a half hour every day, OK? I promise. CAPTAIN: Karen, meet your new partner, Wayne Hollander. Karen, we were informed by a couple of students at Montgomery High that they were approached by a drug pusher while they were on campus. We had him picked up yesterday, but he didn't have anything on him. I want him locked up before we have another accident. But that's Raoul's territory. Why go after the small guy when we know the source? Raoul is off limits to you, Karen. If you pick him up one more time without probable cause, the DA will make us look like idiots, and they'll have your badge. Leave Raoul alone. I repeat, he is off limits to you. Is that understood? Yes, sir. Excuse me. Wayne. Wayne Hollander. I know. I met you already. Yeah, well, we're going to be working together. Is this your first assignment? Yeah. We'll start 7:30 tomorrow morning, OK? Well, should I bring anything? No. Shouldn't we talk about it? I mean, what we're going to do, how we're going to-- can I take you to dinner? How old are you? I'm 21. Why? I'll see you tomorrow. [honking] What happened? I don't know yet. But I'll bet you dollars to doughnuts she OD'ed someplace, and someone got rid of the body. [music playing] You're all under arrest. Back against the wall. What are you doing? Get her. She's bluffing! -Don't move. -Get her. -Don't do it! Give me the gun, bitch! Get her. Don't do it! Don't even try it. Don't move. [gunfire] Go ahead, scum bag. Pick it up. Now, wait a minute. Pick it up! [gunfire] OK. No, no, no, no, no, no. I don't know what I'm thinking. This is a Chinese movie. You'll have to come out, hon. Um, honey, what's your name? Venus Ginsburg. Venus. OK, Venus. You've got great comedy timing. Oh, thank you. And I'm going to be doing a comedy next. Jerry Goldstein's giving me $2 million to back a comedy, and you're going to be in it. OK, so now we're going to do a movie. Stand right here. All right, let's go. Come on. Sound ready? Camera ready? Come on, fog it up. Let's go. Action. "Tokyo Blows 2," scene 12, take one. Cut, cut, cut. Where's the music? [music playing] Fog it up. Fog it up.
