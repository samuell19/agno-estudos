But at the builder's merchant here all they had were tiles like these. Especially in salmon pink. They're not as ugly as l thought. Look, it's simple. That whole floor should come out, really. While we're at it, l'd take out the floor in the toilet too. We might as well do it right. l'll start on the drain, while you think it over, okay? Coffee? Coffee? -Thanks. Hey, that's Bennie.

Fifteen years, but l grew up around here. Working in the city, living in the country. ls the renovation coming along? To be honest, l'm hardly ever there. l'm always in Amsterdam. Aparty. Something with residents, or what do you call them, neighbours. Another glass? -You must think: What's she doing here? To be honest, l hadn't expected it. -l feel so embarrassed. You were so kind, so sweet. And l... l'm sorry l didn't get to finish it. ls it finished? Finished? No, it's not. So l can't shower anymore. But l take baths. l put a washtub in the kitchen, so l can take baths. ln the tub? That's... Coffee? -You're driving, so coffee is better. Maybe it is. -Coffee. Marieke, cup of coffee? Damn.

Why? Herfst: he would do it again in a second. -Howdo you know? All statistics say so. -You don't even know him. l did everything l had to do. l went to the police, l did everything. Herfst: lt'sjust a matter of time. Why would he be any different? Stop it. -He'll be successful and you'll be guilty. Herfst: You can stop him. You have to. lt's your duty. You don't know what you're talking about. You don't know him, nor me. l hate this. Goddammit. You don't know what happened. And how. Asshole. Come on, boy, sit up. Beans, beans, beans. Deep ridge potato crisps, white chocolate and rice. Awhite sandwich with chocolate sprinkles and blue cheese. Herring with onions, capers, glass of red wine, chocolate éclair. Caramel custard, hot chocolate with cream, kebab, glass of red port. Toffees, sponge cake, warm fruit. Yes, good evening. Are you still open? l'd like two times number 8, 119... 21 , 38, yummy. Great. l'm on my way. Are four pairs of chopsticks enough? -Yes. Here you go. Enjoy it. -Thank you. Hey, Marieke. -l have lots of Chinese food. Hungry? Yes? Yes, great. -Have you eaten yet?

You don't have to cook tomorrow. -No, thanks. Always welcome for a midnight picnic. -Great. Coat. -Overthere. There you go. Thank you. Where are we going? Please, stop. Can l get out here? Stop. Where are you taking me? Where are we going? you know it's not yourfault we must do something about this Goddammit. l'm sitting in the aisle. Dressed in black. Hey, how are you? What are you doing here? Why haven't you called? l'm here with Josef and Maurice. No, it's very crowded. Do you have an appointment? You look great. We're sitting overthere. ln case you feel like joining us. Herfst, l'll come to you. Where are you? lt was my dream that told me, but in the end it took all of a week... and a predictor test before l really believed in you. l told myself you couldn't be there, because l didn't feel it. But yesterday l found myself talking to you... so l guess that's when l started to believe in you. Anyway, we have to discuss this. For l'd love to welcome you in your warm shelter, of course. But you can't stay. Because l'm already enough for myself. Sorry. l'm slowlygetting better, but for a long time l wasn't doing well at all. And your arrival would confuse things to no end. And that would make me very angry. Because l'm very glad that l've made it this far. And l think l'd come to hate you and maybe hurt you. Because l can't stand the crying of babies. l think you've simply picked the wrong belly. And l'd be a very bad motherto you. And your father doesn't know, and if he did, he might want to stay with me. And l reallycan't have that, as he's no match for me. He'd probably love you, but that's no damn good to us. You're not in his belly. So you'll have to find a new belly. And l think many bellies would be very happy with you. But not me. Sorry. Or is it possible over the internet? Afifteen-second loop. And how long does it have to be in sight? What are you doing? Yes, l'll rememberthat. Alright. Yes, it's really high time. Did you feel that? -lt's kicking. Wait, do it again. Cuckoo. Dear little man or woman, l don't care, as long as it's one of the two. Hey, sweetheart. Come on, baby, give us a kick. Look, there he is. How's it going? -You're already here. l haven't done any shopping yet. Jesus, Marieke. Come, let me see. Let's take a shower. -No, first we'll take care of your hand. Let's take a shower. -No games now. Come on. We'll first prick that blister and then take a shower. Come. Ouch girl, this is much too hot. Yes, this is better. This is better. Yes, thank you. Why do you never want to talk about it? The city is so aggressive. You don't realize it at first. But once you notice it, you see it all the time. You could look for a job around here. You don't have to work in Amsterdam. Taxi centres in Amsterdam have met today... to discuss theirdrivers' safety. Yesterday night a driver died after an incident involving violence. Can l have a pillow? What's the matter? -l had some oil on my... No, you look perfect. Just perfect. Really? -lt moves. And that's a good thing too. Just in time for it to go like this. -Yes, funny. lt's not good forthe baby, rushing like that. Hey Marieke, are you home already? lt's all going wrong... Phone. Shit. -Marieke? l've lost my phone. Fuck. Herfst, pick up the phone. Pick up the phone. Yes, it's Marieke. Bad news. There's police everywhere. l don't know, but they're everywhere. l have to get rid of it. Shit, l can't get rid of it. l have to make a call, okay? You have to throw away everything too. No, we don't have time forthat. Oh, shit. Fuck, fuck, fuck. Fucking computer. No, someone... No, l have to talk. Don't do that. No, John, bugger off. No, l have to finish this. Herfst, listen. No, dammit. Calm down. Calm down. She'll call you back. -No, dammit. Calm down, now. -No, l have to finish this, you prick. Come. -No. Marieke. -No, l'm doing fine. Really, l'm doing fine. Darling, l'm fine. -Calm down. No, l don't want to. No. Calm down. Calm down. No, l'm drowning.
