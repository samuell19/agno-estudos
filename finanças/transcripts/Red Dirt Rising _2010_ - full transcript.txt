(crickets chirping) (slow country music) - Everything's set. - Yeah, you're all packed up then? - Yes sir. - You know, the truck of yours won't do much longer. - Folks said it ain't the machine, but the name that matters. - You handle things all right. - We're still the same though. - I still certed you, boy. - Yes, sir. - Sherrif's comin', Pa! - Get off! Get outta the home, boy! - What should I do? - Get goin'! (banjo music) (car engine idling) - hydrogen levers. - Boy, sit your tail down. Are you asking for a bullet, coming up here lit up like a ballpark? - It won't happen again. - Damn right. I ain't give you leave to go. Me and my boys are new here. We ain't gonna tell you how we're gonna do things. - I appreciate the cars. - Them shotguns ain't for long now. They're for stool pigeons, snow poles. Get me? - Yes sir. - Let me know what you're hearin', boy. - I can handle myself. - I'll be the judge of that. Now, you best git. (slow guitar music) - Where in the name of notion you at? - Eager to greet the days, huh? - Maybe I oughta have your papa take you out back and give you a "what for" - I think you're doing it good. - Jimmy, you are riskin' an awful lot. - We gotta eat, don't we? - Well, we've gotten by so far. - Well, I'm gonna help. - Like I said, if anything ever happened to you, I'd die. (footsteps approaching) - Why ain't there no corn left on my plate? I suppose my son ain't been out to milk the cow. - Milking cows is women's work. - You talking back to me, Jimmy Lewallen? - No sir. I'm just saying. - Look, here's your biscuits and your eggs are going to be ready in a jif, okay? Jimmy, get yourself a biscuit. - Yes'm. - What you been doing with my truck? - I fixed that oil like you was on about. - I guess you took the liberty of testing it after? - Just rode it around a while. - This family can't afford them kinda kegs you hear me? - I just wanted-- - You leave that truck be, unless I say. You understand me? You got that? Huh? - Yes sir. (slow guitar music) - Hey Jimmie. - Jimmie? - Yeah, ma? - Was you planning on meeting up with Bill and Fred later? - I'd sure like to. Blair's just back from High Rock Lake. - No trouble. - I won't start none, won't be none. - Okay, I'll talk to your daddy about the truck. - All right. (slow guitar music) - Hey, Pop. - Done with them chickens? - Sure did, a while ago. - What a surprise, then there's a first time for everything, ain't there? What? - Nothing. - Yeah, that's what I thought. (metal clanking) - Well, you've all been runnin' this thing hard. Gimme a yank. (grunts) - You wanna help me wipe down the flathead? - No, not particularly, Fred. - Go on. - Aye-aye, cap'n. Gracious alive, Jimmie. You see this thing? Got half the farm in here. You plannin' on pickin' up Brack's delivery? - Can't do it. - Awe, sorry, I forgot. Tuesday's needlepoint night for you, isn't it? - Oh listen to you. Then again, like you need it your car look better than most. - Y'all two need to quit messin' with that devil juice I tell you. - Look Fred, how we come by is our own business. - I hear they've hooked to that, stuffed their radiators. - How come you think it tastes so good? - Well, you all gonna help me pick this hay outta the engine? (laughs) - This is a fine mess in here. - Is Pop's standard still up? - Mm-hmm. - I wish he'd just give me a chance. - You ain't no help. - Well, bless his heart. - Stop that. - You know, he sure gets on Bill and me the quickest. - Fathers are always tough with their sons. - Well, Bill ain't even his kin. - You know, something tells me he's sore about some of the breaks Bill's daddy got that he didn't. - It just don't seem fair. - I expect your papa feels the same way. (sighs) - Well, I'm gonna hit the sack. I gotta whole hill of potatoes to dig tomorrow. Goodnight, Mama. (door slams) - Don't you have a wife to get home to? - Morning, Pop. You scared the devil outta me. - I see you're still itching to get the Feds crammed down your throat. - They don't have no reason to trouble us. - Bill Blair, are you gonna stand there and lie right at me? - No sir. - You know, around here, a mason jar's got more lies than a cat. Let your mama put something less incriminating in them. - I ain't never gotta call from the sherrif on me. - Don't underestimate Beecher, son. He knows every car in this county. - My apologies for tryin' to spread a little joy around here. - Tires are getting a little slick on this side. - Yeah. Thanks, Pop. (ripping noise) - Cold prison shower is a poor stubstitute for that bride of yours. - Yes, sir. (mellow guitar music) (upbeat banjo music) - That all you got? - I'll bet you half this payload I get past Beecher before you do. - Hoohoo! You're on! (engine dies) No, no, no, come on, now! Come on, baby! (engine sputters and clicks) - Oh lord, please don't let this be Beecher. (car approaching noise) - That you, Bill Blair? - Yes, sir. Sherriff, I'm glad to see you. I was just out lookin' for you. - That so? - Yes, sir. There is a ruckus up behind here. A couple of big ol' boys. They're duking it out and I'm sure they could use your assistance. - Then why are you stopped? Everything all right? - With me, yes, sir. I'm fine. I'm just looking for a flashlight's all. - So you could look for me? - (laughs) You had me there, yeah. How's the missus? (upbeat guitar music) - It's 6:00 man, what happened? - Beecher. - He catch you? - Uh-uh, but damn near. Told him I saw a couple of ol' boys duking it out over a girl on Miller's Road. I don't know about all that, but I think he bought it. - Yeah, until he finds out there ain't no girl, ain't no dukes. - One more night with my Lucille, that's all I see clear to. How come you don't meet yourself a girl anyway? - When I find one that's worth getting. - Hell, I can name you a few if you ain't so keen on bland conversation, do you know what I'm saying? - I can't afford to go steady. - Who said anything about that? - Anyways, you still owe me half a beating. - (laughs) There is that, I suppose, but it's a technicality if you ask me. That's why I don't have any gas. - You see, that's just not right. (knocking on door) - Door's open, Carrie. - Factory whistle's in 20 minutes. - Well then, we'd better getta move on. I'm ready. - What're you all gussied up for? - Mama says "Always be prepared" (engine sputtering) - Oh no. What're we gonna do now? What're we gonna do? - We're gonna walk. - It is miles to the factory. I will not make it in these shoes. Hey, I got an idea. We're near the Lewallen home place. They gotta truck and a nice lookin' boy to drive it. What do you say? - Good thing you put on all that lipstick. - Morning Mrs. Lewallen. - May I help you? - I'm Dottie, this here's Carrie. I'm a friend of Jimmie's. Is he home? - Well, he's out tillin'. I can have Harold fetch him? - That'd be right kind of you. - Harold! Now, how do you girls like Archdale? - Too quiet for me. Daddy seems to think it's a good place for me to stay outta trouble. Carrie's new here. She seems to like it on her own. - Well then, you two should come to Friend's Meeting on Sunday, with us. - I reckon I might, thank you. - Well, hey there, Jimmie. I haven't seen you in a while. - What brings you by? - This is Carrie, son. She's another woman from the boarding house. - How do you do? - Hi there, nice to meet you. - These ladies could use a ride to work, son. - Glad to. Yeah, come on. - Thank you for the water. - Thank you so much. - You're so welcome. - This is just so sweet. I gotta think of a way to express my gratitude. - Don't mention it. - I'm just gonna hop in the back. - No, no, no, no. Come on, come on. Sit up front. You sit in the middle. - You sure? - Yeah, come on. - You taking on mechanics work now? - No sir, I brought a couple of girls out to the factory. - I see. Need a hand? - Appreciate it. - All right. Shake the hose. - The bad news, the carburetor. Things are always getting clogged. - Yeah, could be that, but it's the hose. Take a look. Clamp's loose. Betcha what happened was engine overheated because the water evaporated out of it, so all you gotta do is tighten that clamp down. You go out to the well, get a pail of water, you fill it up, it'll be good as new. Girls are gonna like that, but just my thoughts on it. Being your helper is hard. (engine turns off) (knocks on door) - Well, hey again! Don't you clean up nice? Wanna come in for some lemonade? - Got your car running. Is Carrie here? I was kinda hoping she'd give me a ride home. - She's off running errands with Miss Haggins. - Oh. - Well, I could give you a ride (laughs) - No thanks. I'd just as soon walk home if that's all right. - So are you gonna be home for supper? - I should be home around suppertime. - All right. - [Ellie] Hey Bill? - Yes, ma'am? - You make sure you gets home by supper. - You can count on me, Ms Lewallen. - Oh, don't you worry. Bill's got plans with me tonight, and he ain't gonna be getting in any trouble. Ain't that right, Bill? - Yeah, absolutely. Whatever you say. - [Ellie] All right, well you boys best be getting along. - I'll see you at the barn, Bill. Bye, Ma. - [Ellie] Bye, honey. - [Bill] Hey, hey! Here you go. - Hey. - Hey. - Can I give you a lift? - It's all right. I seem to have better luck walkin' than I do ridin' these days. - Dropped Dottie's car off the other day Was kinda hoping to see you there. - Why is that? - No reason. - Well, shouldn't you best be getting on here? - All right then, I guess I'll be seeing you later. - [Fredl] Man, this fuel line's pushing slower than molasses in January. - [Jimmie] Wanna hand? - [Fred] No, I reckon I got it. - So where'd Lucille run off to? - She went with Mama and Pop to see the new calf. - [Fred] Ain't it so cute! " Come on, Bill. " Let's go see the baby. (laughs)" I reckon that's the cutest thing I ever did see in my whole life, I tell you what? - Gary Knowles. I say, how about that Carrie girl? - What do you mean? - She's a might pretty. - I suppose. - You suppose? I saw you looking at her. - [Jimmie] So? I look at lots of things. - (clears throat) Are y'all two gonna quit your gosspin' and give me a hand? I ain't gonna be able to keep this car runnin if y'all keep treatin' it the way you do. - This, comin' from the man who changes the fuel line from under the car? - Hey! Never you mind. I'm the only one here who knows what I'm doin'. - Jeez Fred, what's eatin' ya? - Nothin's eatin' me, but I can't very well feel sorry neither when y'all two are forever up to no good. - No good? Did he just-- - He did. - (laughs) Fredrick, that hurts my feelings. I'll tell you what. I'm gonna make you a little wager on just how "no good" I really am. I got ten cents here that says my Coupe can take both y'alls cow patties to the fence line and back. - You don't say? - I sure as hell do. (upbeat banjo music) (engines idling) - Boys, turn off them engines. (engines cut out) - The sheriff just called. - What'd he want? - You know damn well what he wanted, Bill Blair. - I just come in from Greensboro, Mr Blair. - Well, you've got more sense than the two of these put together. Now'd be a good time for you to head on back! Front and center, boys. Y'all were tearin' hell outta them roads when you came back from church. I am not gonna stand for it! If you two wanna do somethin' with these machines, other than what Henry Ford intended, well that is one thing, but when you bring your speed devilin' to the roads of Randolph County, now that is somethin' else. - Pa, we will lay off. - [Mr Blair] Oh, you will do more than that. You will cease and desist today! That includes the cornfields and the cow patches. - Look, Pa. We didn't mean to stir up any trouble-- - Listen here! I hear tell anymore foolishness from you two, and I will call your papa, and I will set Beecher on you my damn self. Now are we clear? - Yes, sir. - Well, get outta my sight. (car door opens and closes) - Lord, where y'all been at, boys? I didn't think y'all was ever gonna show up. - Well, that was fun. I'd like to do that again sometime soon. - Whoo! So, about that bet? Got anything for me? - (laughs) I dunno, but you earned that. - And? (kicks bumper) Come on, quit holdin'. - Did you want me to help you out here? - If you don't mind? - Am I ever gonna see any of these back? - I appreciate it. - Probably not. Thank y'all fellas, kindly. Pleasure doin' business with ya. - As long as you know that I had you both. - Bill, who's the cow patty now? (hammering noise) (harmonica music) - Say man, what'd you clear on deliveries this week? - I dunno, why? - No reason. - Oh lord, is this about Carrie again? - No, why'd you say that? - 'Cause you're sweet on her. - No, I ain't. - Well, good. A girl as sophisticated as she is, she won't have anything to do with you, farm boy. - You see, you're just jealous 'cause she's better than Lucille. - Now, I know you're not talking about my Lucille, are you? - Y'all simmer down, simmer down now! I'll tell you what, Bill. I sure really do miss the farm. Your mama's apple pies. Your papa's voice crackling like bacon on a hot skillet, your sister's big ol'-- - Hey, hey! Come on, Fred. - Well, what in tarnation are you doin'? - You see, I was wonderin' when someone would take a shine on my genius. What I'd done here is, I rigged me up a do-jobber which shuts off the brake lights from inside the car. - Well, why'd you wanna go and do somethin' 'like that? That's only good for crooks and criminals. - Well, you never know. Folks might like to have the option one day. - Well, I tell you what, Mr Blair, feel like givin' her a test run up to the fence line? - Fred, Pop would have our asses. - You know, Mr Blair only said to not tear hell across Randolph County, but we ain't in Randolph County. - Look, guys! - Oh, thanks, Mama. You read my mind. - It is hot today. - Indian Summer's definitely a promise. - I'd take it over a long winter day anytime. - Amen. - You boys head up to the house and wash up. Jimmie, I wanna know if you have intentions towards that Carrie girl. - She won't even let me court her past the front steps. I can't seem to get her off my mind is all I know. - Now you be careful with her, okay son? - I hear she's not all she appears to be. - What are you tryin' to say, Mama? It appears to me she's just a strong woman tryin' to make it on her own. Folks gonna hold that against her? Don't you think that's the kinda woman I ought to be with? We met at the same meadow you showed me, comin' up. - Yeah, I know. Be that as it may, I mean, what do you really know about her, Jimmie? Life can't be fair to all of us. - Yeah, I reckon not. This ain't all there is. - Maybe not, for you. - Hey, how'd you get her over here? - Don't blame me. I didn't have anything to do with it. Thank Lucille. She's the one with the touch. - Lord, here we go again. If you wanna impress her, why don't you show her what you got? - Because I ain't got squat. - Speed, stupid. Girls love that kinda moxie. - He's gotta point you know? What do you think? - Couldn't hurt. (engines start up) - Oh! - The hell kinda driving was that? - Bill? - This is a workin' farm, and you know that. Don't you think for one minute, BIll Blair I'm not up to whoopin' you just 'cause you a married man. (grunts) (engine revving) - Hey! - Hey. - What on earth took y'all so long? - We just heard the sound of thunder from Pop. - Oh, great. Well, that ladies and gentlemen is the end of racing as we know it. Good job. Way to go, fellas. - Thanks, Fred. - Lord have mercy. What is your Pop gonna do now? - There's no telling, babe. I think we probably ought to head on back to town. I think it'll be the last I'll hear about it. - Say, I'm gonna stay a spell. - Yeah? - Do you mind if I keep you company? - Sure - Take care. - [Lucille] See you later, Carrie! (car horn beeps) - So how'd you get started in racing, anyhow? - You could say Bill, I mean, he's practically a professor. - Moonshine, huh? - Yeah. At least I have fun, right? - I suppose. - Why don't you like me? - Who said I didn't like you? - Well, you sure have a funny way of showin' it if you do. - It ain't you, Jimmie, it's me. - I know I'm just a farm boy and all, but I ain't stupid. I used that same line before, myself. - It ain't a line. It's 'cause of where I come from. My background and all. - How bad could it be? - You really don't know why I'm here? I used to be married. - You're kiddin' right? - No. I mean, my mama and daddy, - they've struggled since the day I was born. They had a whole mess of kids and I was just always looking for opportunity to get outta that house. I just wish I wouldn't have taken the first opportunity that came around. I mean, after I got married, he did nothin'. He laid around all day. I had to go get work, and it ain't easy getting work where I come from. It's not like it is here. Things just kinda got bad and I left, and got divorced. Now I'm here. - That's kinda how my family is too. I mean, I wanna get away from them, but I can't. Do you love him? - Yeah. I suppose I did. It's just for all the wrong reasons though. (slow guitar music) - Mr Blair? Do you know where Bill is? - You can try the back fields behind the barn. (laughing) (engine approaching) - What in the name of God? - Jimmie? - Yeah? Two bits says I can beat you ten times around this thing. (upbeat music) (talking quietly) - Hey, how y'all doin'? - All right. - Good. - This here's Henry Suttles. - I invited him to come up and race with us. - Thank you for havin' me. - We were just remarkin' on that car. That's right sharp. Is that yours? - Well, thank you. That's my pop's car. My pop will make me quit school if I tear up his car. - So you don't go that fast? (laughter) - Yes, ma'am. I go fast. - Or is that 'cause you're friends with Fred and all. - Hey, what's that supposed to mean? (car approaching) - This is Carolina Racing? Red dirt tracks and dried up fields. Hi, fellas. - Hi. - Hey there, baby boy. - How you doin' Miss Mason? - Don't you dare speak to my wife. - Buck, you already causin' trouble? - Jimmie Lewallen, as I live and breathe. - Henry, you got your car ready for the race? - Sure do. Fred's been a big help. - Hey, you wanna quit your jawin' and let's go get you tied in? - It's okay you bein' here, Buck. You just mind your edge that's on the track. - You mind yours and I'll mind mine. You best be goin' or you know what's comin'. (cars revving) - Sorry you didn't win. - Aw, it was nothin'. - You reckon you might take me on a proper date now? - You mean it? - Well, there's no reason to be so eager, I didn't agree to marry you or nothin'. - Let me show you somethin'. Come on. - What? - I'll show you, come on. - What are you doin'? - You'll see. After you. - Okay. - Just hang on. - What are you doing? (lively music) - Surprised to see you up before dawn. What'd I tell you about that truck out there? - Sir? - I marked how much gas was in it last night. - Well, I forgot right as rain, after chores. - Don't worry about it. You ain't gonna be using that truck no more. - But Pop! - I'm through lettin' you take chances with what little the good Lord has seen fit to provide us. - Pop, you've gotta lot to say about what goes on around here. I ain't your property to deal with. - What did you say to me, boy? (slow guitar music) - Not any word. - Hey, you wanna hand me that socket wrench? Thank you. - Listen, I keep vowing number two. I try to reject them, but he's not gettin' anything out of it. Thoughts? - You might wanna check your points on the distributor. - That'd be great. - What happened to you? You all right? - Look, I hope you don't mind me sayin' this but Roy's just Roy. You can't let him get to you like that Jimmie. - I think he's madder than a possum in a gas can. - Now, that weren't nothin' compared to when Ellie finds out about you and that Carrie girl. - You're too young to understand. - No, I ain't. I got me my own fiancee. - You what? - Yep. - What's her name? - Betty. She's as pretty as the day is long. I met her up at the roller rink. - Yeah, right. - I gotta notice about the news so it might cheer you all up. My daddy took that manager job down at the furniture mart. - You idiot, how's that good news? - He's gonna let me manage the garage, stupid. (laughs) - Okay, that's pretty good news. - Cheers. - I don't wanna be the one to bring this up but how are you gonna make a livin' without a truck? - More than that, how am I gonna race? - You can come and work for me if you want. - No, I gotta help tend the farm. At least wise until my brothers get bigger. That does say you got it done. That'll be good for somethin'. - Well, you know I did have a fella from up the Trinity Way come in the garage today. Tried to sell me his Coupe for 50 dollars. - 50 dollars? Did he push it in? - Why didn't you say so? - I've got his address right here. - Come on, man! - Ladies, ladies, ladies. - I believe you there. (laughs) - I believe there's a matter of a quarter. Oh, that's your quarter now. - Yeah, I guess this is your quarter (laughs) - Come on, boy. I'll take you down right here! - So what do you think? - Well, there's a right big open grids on there, but I reckon it should do. - I can make a few adjustments. Hey, Carrie! How about a kiss for good luck? - In your dreams. Where's the truck? - That's my new car. Ain't she a beaut? - I guess. How am I supposed to count when it looks like all the others? (laughs) - Come on. (engines idling) - Have you lost your mind? - Hey! False player! - Not now, Buck. - Hey, why you got Jimmie on the inside? I come in faster qualified. - The time is proper. - If you say so. I believe you in his pocket. - I can't believe those guys got into it again. Do you think Bill has the worst trousers, to you? - It's hard to say. - Yep, I think they're done for. In all my married years, Carrie, I have mended more trousers than I've had dinners out. - Oh (laughs) - Hey, Lewallen! You advertising your lot in life? Your big zero (laughs) Hey, best be glad my tire blew out or I'd have whooped you today. - Can't you just congratulate me, Buck? - Buck ain't capable of that. - Come on, let me go! (grunts) - I'll see you next Sunday. Come on, baby, come on. It's all right. Come on, now. That's a good girl. (slow guitar music) - I cannot believe that driving does this to your hands. You look awful! I can't believe that. - Your husband ever treat you like that? - Like what? - You know, how ... Buck is with his girl? - No. Ain't nobody ever gonna treat me that way. Jimmie, I don't wanna talk about that. I told myself I'm gonna enjoy my last days in Archdale. - What do you mean? - Well, they're naming off some women at the factory, and I'm gonna be losing my job soon. Without work, I'm gonna be moving. I can't stay here if I don't have any work. - I reckon that's good for you. But I don't want you to go. Carrie, you know I love you. - Jimmie, I... don't have any say in this. You best be takin' me home. Okay? (excited conversation) - [Greeter] Welcome to the Tri-City Racetrack. Good to see you. Welcome to the Tri-City Racetrack. Enjoy yourselves. - [Woman] Thank you, sir. - [Greeter] Tri-City Racetrack, welcome to you. Good to see you. - You sure have done a mighty fine job, settin' all this up. - Thank you. - That your boy? - Sure is. You know, he had an awful lot to do with puttin' this whole thing together too. - My boy, Buddy, he's about yea high. He's already into racing. - Oh boy. Well, listen. It's about time for me to make the rounds. Why don't you come with me? I'll introduce you to some of the drivers. - That sounds good. I'd appreciate that. - Hey, Bill. - Huh? - Who's that? - Who's who? - On the claw of your dad? - That's Bud Nance. Race promoter down Florida way. They do it on the beach there. - That'll put sand in your drawers (laughs). - I'd like to do it on the beach someday. (laughs) - Boy, your engines are running, but there's damn sure ain't nobody behind the wheel. - What? (laughs) - Henry, just keep eatin' your peanuts. (engines roaring) (sparking noise) (flames whoosh) (Henry screaming) (loud crash) (dramatic music) (flames crackle) - [Bill] Look, I know that we're all sorry, but cuttin' him off out there and as much as I like to, we can't lay this at his doorstep. - Someone who's done right there. - Jimmie, you're no saint, but if you tell me this was an accident I'll know you're tellin' the truth. - It was. - It's a real shame. - All right then. - I reckon it's time I go tell his folks. - It coulda been you. - What? Races just ain't all that dangerous. - You tell that to that dead boy's mama. - I reckon that ain't perfect. - I don't want that to happen to you. - I know things ain't always been good for you. Life can't be perfect for all of us. I know I ain't perfect neither. But you'd think... you think maybe we might be perfect for each other? ♪ Your love is like a crystal water ♪ Pure and sweet it gently flows ♪ Southern son and mountain daughter ♪ Easy as it goes (light guitar music) - Are you scared? - Not anymore. - You expect to be long? - Long enough for you to get your stuff packed up. - Think your mama's gonna be mad? - Well, if she is, we'd better find another state to sleep in at night. I'll stay the same, Mrs Lewallen. - Good luck. (car starts) - Hey, Mama. What's wrong? - You've been called to service. Jimmie. (Ellie crying) - You take care of of yourself, son. Okay? - All right, Mama. - He'll be fine, Mama. Let's go. - Jimmie, I love you. - Was there ever any doubt? (Carrie crying) (gunshots firing) (airplane flying overhead) - [Carrie] Livin' at your mama's is good. She's been real kind to me. She's been teachin' me how to bake a lotta things. I think even your pop's taken a liking to me. Well, that might be because he found out he's gonna be a granddaddy soon. (bomb explodes) - Get down, man! - [Carrie] He did say you wanted a whole mess of kids. I just want you to come home soon. (splashing water) - [Carrie] I love you, "daddy". (splashing water) (distant gunshots) - [Carrie] Enclosed is a picture of your baby girl at her second birthday. Everybody says she looks just like her daddy and she is already talkin' up a storm, you won't believe it. (gunshot firing) - [Carrie] I just can't wait for this war to be over and I just want you to know how proud I am of you. I just want you home so you can hold me in your arms. (dramatic music) (shot fires) - Dear Carrie... (laughs) oh thank God, it's from Jimmie! - Okay. - I hope this letter arrives timely, because I wanna be sure you have plenty of notice. I'm comin' home this summer, and I want you to be forewarned. Tell Harold I heard about him wreckin' my car and it better be fixed when I get there (laughs). The box I sent contains a few mementos I got from planes. What happened, at Normandy and the Battle of the Bulge. Please show me to my little girl so she'll know there's a reason she hadn't seen her daddy yet. The Purple Hearts ain't arrived. I believe there's three. They might get there before I do. Tell everyone that I will see them soon, Jimmie. Oh my goodness. - He's coming home. - Yeah, yes he is. Oh my. - What's wrong, Rita? - Stay and play with me? - Aww, come here. Daddy's gotta go to work. They need me to see to all them nice cars. - You have to see me too. - How about if I tell you a story later? - You mean it? - Of course I do. I gotta get. - Daddy, are we poor? - No, sweetie. - Why do you have to work so much? - Well, everybody's got to work. - I don't. I'm just a little girl. - Well, you help your mama around the house. - Yeah, but I don't like to. - Here, give her to me. - Go see Mama. Give me a kiss, bye. - Don't forget to pay the gas bill. - I got it. - Love you! - Love you too. - Lewallen? - Hey. - How are you doin'? - Good, yourself? - Good. You're lookin' good today. - Likewise. - At my house, I've got a picture of you up there with Jeffrey where your fourth tire finished the race before you did. You won the race, but only on three wheels. - I remember that. Let's get back to advance your car. - Okay. - Want me to pop the hood for you? - Yeah. - How you doin' Bill? - I can't complain. Things are pretty good. - I've been seein' your pop's campaign signs all over town. - Yeah, if things keep goin' the way they're goin' he'll be Senator Blair come fall. - You stayin' busy? - Yeah, I got the dairy farm I'm runnin' Tri-City while dad's on the road. You know, it keeps me goin'. I see you're getting' restarted in the family business. - Well, you like doin' the race track? - Yeah, it's all right I guess, but I'd rather be drivin. Listen, think maybe you'd come out this Saturday? Race a little bit? - I don't know. I mean, what with the family and all. - I got the same. - Yeah, but you ain't in a pinch to feed 'em every week. - Well, for whatever it's worth, the purses are getting a little bit better. I'm not tryin' to talk you into nothin', but I think it'd mean a lot to the folks around here, me included if you come on out and join us this weekend. - You know, I've been waitin' for a chance to whip you again. - Aww hell (laughs). Whip me again? - (laughs) Yeah. - Like hell. - What do you think about that, Bill? - We'd better get you on out there. I'll take it. - Well, we'll have to find out. - [Carrie] Eat your soup, sweetheart. I don't want you to. - You knew I was a racer when you married me. Carrie, the purse is 100 dollars. - I don't care. After what happened to Henry, and the war and everything? I thought that part of our life was over. - Yeah. Well, I started thinking of my dad too. I stopped racing so we could have all this for us. When I'm out on them tracks I feel alive. Can't you understand that, Carrie? - But you think we're gonna live forever, and we ain't. - We gotta live. Come on, babe. - Do you want some cake? - Yeah. - Can daddy have a piece of cake too? - Mm-hmm. - Can he have two pieces of cake? - No. - Maybe? - Maybe. - [Bill] Look at this guy. Hey, Lewall! Nice hat. - Well, ain't this a hoot? - Isn't it? Crazy, huh? - How you doin' Bill? - I'm good, you? - I'll tell you what, things sure have changed. - What you doin' boy? - Hey Fred. - Welcome back. - Thanks. - Yeah, money still ain't nothin' to squawk about though. - Is there anything you won't complain about? Hey, I meant to tell you guys. Listen to this, I heard some of the drivers down in Georgia are getting sponsors now. You ever hear of such a thing? - No. - No, and he won't neither. You've got to have know-how to get paid to race. - Buck, you are windier than a bag of buttholes. - Fred Harb on a race track. Ain't that a sight? We've got us a poker game goin' tonight over the campfire. You care to part with a few dollars? - Well, I suppose poker does beat your usual pasttime if I wanted to fetch more farm animals. - You better shut your little mouth before I take a mind to knock your block off. - Ohh, he makes me mighty scared, gentleman. - Give you a little piece of advice, Curtis. Don't take that fella too lightly. That boy'll run you down as sure as look at you. - He ain't kiddin'. Jimmie Lewallen, how do you do? - Is he kiddin'? - No, Curtis. He ain't kiddin'. There is a time we tried to act like gentlemen out here. - All right, I see. - Jimmie Lewallen, Curtis Turner, resident playboy. - Ah, the ladies' man from Virginia. - You have heard that Virginia's for lovers, right? Where'd you hear that? - Maybe Lucille told me. - Where is that old gal? - Never you mind, Curtis. Never you mind. Why don't you run along? - All right, gentlemen. I guess I will see you out on the track, old man - Mm-hmm. - I gotta get my beauty rest. - We'll see you there. - He does need his beauty rest. - Reminds me of somebody I used to know. (door squealing) - You've gotta lot of nerve sneaking in so late. - I just came to get a blanket. I'm gonna stay with Fred and Bill at the track. - Just like the old days? - Oh, I got you somethin'. (child crying) - I'm sorry, babe. I'll tend to her. - What did you bring me? - Tickets. - Tickets? - I'll take two. - You know? - Ready. - Hey, is this good? - (laughs) No, fold. - Four, Jimmie? - Now I'm the one that's losin'. - Dealer takes. - I lost that. What you got? - Full house, pay up. - He's cheatin'. Ain't no way you can have a full house again, Buck. - Y'all are always accusing me of things and I don't have no idea why. - Tell me you ain't got nothin' up your sleeve. - Fellas, I'm out. I just can't keep this kinda company. - Goes to show you, there's no hard feelings when you pay up. I'll buy you a drink. I hear this here come from one of Jimmie Lewallen's suppliers. - Hey, you know I ain't messed with that in years. - Don't you get all high and mighty with me, Lewall. Just 'cause everybody thinks you were a hero over there, that don't make you shit back here. - Can I borrow $2? - No you may not lose two of my dollars, Doug Ross, go and ask your mama. You know, it must be awful hard without being such a son of a bitch, Buck. I think I'm gonna go join Fred. - So it's just you and me, Buck. - Take it easy, Jimmie. It's only a game. (applause) - Hey, Jimmie. Do you remember me? - Of course, Mr Nance. I'm surprised to see you here though. I thought you were off promotin' a race off of Johnson Street. - Well, you know I gotta check out the competition. That was mighty fine racing out there today. That's the experienced one today. - It feels good to be back out there. - I don't wanna take up too much of your time. Do me a favour, call me Bud. My daddy's Mr Nance, all right? - Will do. - All right, congratulations. - Thanks. - Spin me, grandpa, spin me! - Oh, I think grandpa's too tired for that. Why don't you run inside and see grandma? I know she wants to see you, okay? - Okay. - All right, hop on down. There you go. Oh my goodness, you're heavy. - Bye grandpa, bye. Love you. - I love you too, darlin'. - So how was the doctor? - They don't know nothin'. - I see you got the far fields mowed and ready. - Yep. Your brother, Harold come by, done that. - You gonna need some help tillin'? - No. Mama made arrangements for that too. - I see. You know, I started racin' again. Got one comin' up soon. You and Mama should come out and watch. - No. No, your mama dont wanna see that. - All right, Pop. I'll see you. (applause) - Ladies and gentlemen, can I have your attention please? I'd like to present your winner. It's Jimmie Lewallen, number zero. (applause) - Hey, wasn't that prized to the wrong driver? - What are you saying, Buck? - I won that race. - Buck, you lost a whole lap when you stopped to fill up and have a smoke. - I did no such thing. Darlin' come here. Now, did you see me stop to smoke? Would you please tell this man? - It says here you did Buck, on lap 20. - You need to pack up your car, Buck. You pack up and you get the hell off my track. - Your track? This track ain't nothin' without me. To hell with you. To hell with all of you. - Jimmie, I want you to address the crowd if you would? Let these people know who the real winner of the race was. Your winner, ladies and gentlemen, Jimmie Lewallen! (applause) (cheering) - Whats wrong? - I'm all right. - You wanted daycare, ain't you happy? - Yeah. (car nudging from behind) - Aw, it's Buck. Are you all right, babe? - Yeah. (car beeping) - All right, that's it. - Easy, Jimmie. - Rubbin's racin' slow poke. Hey! - Mom, why did daddy hit that man? - It's okay, honey. It's all right. Can you get out? - Yeah. Am I walkin' fast for you? - Nope. Am I walkin' to fast for you? - Nope. - Why don't you go ahead? Run on inside, get yourself a cookie, okay? I'm gonna talk to your dad for a minute. You can't go doing that in front of Rita. What happens at the track between you and the boys needs to stay at the track. You can't go bringin' it home. - Buck had it comin'. - I know. Buck's dangerous, and guys like that are a big part of racin' now. It's not like how it used to be, Jimmie. - Carrie, you know what it means to me. - I never asked you to quit! I just don't wanna see you die. - What are you talkin' about? - Jimmie, you're not 17 anymore. You have a family. You have responsibilities here, okay? Now, I'm not saying that all the guys out there are like Buck and they're dangerous, but they're not like you and Bill, who do it for the love of it. It takes one guy like Buck Mason, and you can end up dead. Just one. - You shouldn't think about things like that. - How can I not? Huh? How can I not? I don't wanna be alone, Jimmie. It scares me to death to think about what it would be like if you wasn't here. I'm already alone, tryin' to take care of Rita, waitin' for this baby to come when you're out camping with your friends. I don't wanna take away from that, Jimmie. I don't. But it's hard. It's hard, Jimmie. - I'm just tryin' to do right by us. Just live a little. I work hard, Carrie, you know that. - I know, and that's not what I'm tryin' to say. You know, we may struggle, but you take care of us good, you do. But you gotta understand the position you put me in, and this family in when you're out there racin'. Think about that. - Listen. Mr Nance has called on me down Daytona Beach. Some sorta business proposition. - What's it about? - I don't know. Mr Nance is smart and he wants me there, and I'm gonna go hear him out. - We can't afford to do anything. - I work at the Ford dealer for cryin' out loud. - You can't feed a family on race winnin's. (slow guitar music) - What I'm sayin' is let's make a formal arrangement with the drivers. Keep people on the stands, keep our garages open. Now, as a one-time driver myself, I've been swindled more times than I care to count. We can, and we should, protect these drivers from unethical promoters. - Stop all the fightin'. - Yes. My first order of business would be to expel the likes of Buck Mason and any other driver like him from any of my races. If this thing is handled right, there could be a lot of money made out of it. - It sounds like it'd be a lot safer too. - Measurably. Now, here's what I need: I'm asking each of you for a $500 investment. - Bud, you've been good to us drivers all these years, and I'd like to be a part of this, but I just can't put my family at risk. - You can take a few days and think about it. - I don't need it. Now, I love racin', I truly do. I just ain't convinced it's gonna amount to anything. - Okay, I can't fault you for that, but I am going to go ahead with it. - Best of luck to you. I'll be proud to race at any event you have. - Well, I'll certainly be in touch. Thanks for makin' the trip down, Jimmie. I appreciate it. Questions? - What are you gonna call it? - [Jimmie] I already got a foot ahead of Curtis Turner. I'm gonna beat him by the tail car lights. - (laughs) - He's gonna have a problem with that. - I don't know. How did you land back here so far? - Jimmie Lewallen. - Oh lord, here he is. - What is with this get up? Why aren't you racing today? - Of course I am. Carrie and Rita is up yonder. They've got my gear. - This old man is often the biggest purse I ever heard of, Jimmie. - Curtis, this right here is Fireball Roberts. He's one of my boys from Florida. - Fireball, how are you doin'? Aren't you the one I heard wrecking on the ninth lap in Daytona? You're gonna have to do better than that today boy, if you wanna win this thing. Win that big money. - Sir, yes sir. - Well, speakin' of big money, I gotta go find my boy, he's helping me promote. - Well, you folks be safe out there today. - All right, Mr Nance. - Be careful of that ninth lap. - (laughs) Yes sir. - [Carrie] There it is. Here comes your daddy. You cold? - Yeah. - You know what? Have you looked behind your ears lately? - Yeah. - You have? Then you would see this money that I just found behind that one. Look at that. - You nervous? - Not anymore. - Hey, who's gonna win this race? - Go daddy! - Go daddy! Are you sure he's gonna win? - Yeah. - What are you gonna say? - Go daddy! - Woohoo! We know he's gonna win, don't we? - Yeah. (upbeat music) - So how's business? - Pretty good. - Tri-City's doing all right. - You fixin' to promote a race though. - Carolina versus Georgia I think that'll bring some folks out. - Your pop's doing real good in the senate. - Yeah, politics seems to suit him. No big surprise though, he's always good at tellin' the folks what to do. (laughs) - Times sure are changing. Now, I hear there's a colored fella name of Joie Ray comin' up. - Yeah, yeah. Louisville, I think that's where folks said he hails from. - Yeah, I hear he was live and they're tryin' to get NASs races. - Mr Nance sure seems to be makin' a go at that thing. - I'll tell y'all what. - It might. It might turn into somethin'. I just ain't convinced yet, you know? See what it does. I'll tell you what, I'm gonna get some of Carrie's famous Coca-Cola cake. Do you want some? - Hey, you should. - Yeah, I'll take a piece. - Hey, do y'all have any milk? - Okay. - So I saw little Gary crawling into your driver's seat today. - You don't say? I'll tell you what, that boy. - He's comin' up just like his daddy. - I guess it's better than little Lulu, right? - I reckon she ain't far behind. - They're askin' me to run them down to Daytona next weekend. - Really? - Mm-hmm. - Hmm. - It gives us a whole mess of new drivers. - Well, that's interesting. - It's gonna be a big purse. - A big purse? Hmm. - You know, some of the other families, they like to make a beach trip out of it. - A beach trip? - Mm-hmm, do you wanna get you a tan? - (laughs) Me with a tan. - Say, you're not still scared about me racing, are you? - Not anymore.
