Just take this. Almost had a heart attack. Guys! What? This is not a good idea. Lindsay, it's just.. You do know you could have gotten us all busted? Oh, lighten up, Wyatt. It's your last year of high school. Have some fun for once in your life. That was never part of the plan. What, you having fun? Uh, no, you lifting two bottles of booze with us in the store. You should have told us you were going to do that. And have you guys chicken out? I don't think so. Are you sure your parents aren't coming home? Gone for the entire weekend. And they trust you like that? What can I say? I have the face of an angel. Clearly. Okay, Halloween's not till tomorrow. I'll get that. Oh. Thanks. One second, okay? Okay, he has been crushing on you ever since we were little. When are you gonna give him a shot? We've known each other for so long. It'd be a little weird, don't you think? No, me and Adam have been together ever since middle school. Yeah, but you two are, like, meant to be, you know? Guys, can we pick up the pace? Kyle and Adam are gonna be here soon, and I still need to change. Okay. Who's this Kyle guy, anyway? Who even knows? He got here last week. He's in our English class. She sure doesn't waste any time. When does she ever? Slow and steady wins the race, right, Wyatt? Heh. Did you guys close the door behind you when we left? I thought you were the last one out. Lindsay. Lindsay. Mom? Dad? Are you home? Must have left the door open, I guess. Somebody's been here. Lindsay. It won't open. It won't open! Kyle? Oh, my God. Adam? If this is you guys, it isn't funny! Adam. Adam says him and Kyle are at my place. Yeah, right. Kyle! Kyle, this isn't funny. Adam! Josh, is Adam there? He's your boyfriend. You keep track of him. Just tell me if he's there. All right already. I saw him and some other guy waiting on the front steps. Got to go. Him and Kyle are at my place. Lindsay, get down here. Lindsay. Let's get the hell out of here. Get back! Calling 911. Okay. What is happening? Wyatt! What was that? Okay, okay, we're alive. They won't open. What? They won't open, you guys! They won't open! Shh, shh, shh. The knives! Go, get the knives! Okay, okay. Okay. Beth, the knives. Ah! What? You guys are total asses, do you know that? Oh, come on. You're cute when you're scared. Stop. I hate you. Give me a hug. No! You were in on this too? Of course. I hate you. Beth? What? Beth? Uh... She must have hit her head. Is she breathing? Uh, I think so, but I can't feel a pulse. This.. Guys, this is really bad. Okay, it's fine, I'm just gonna call.. Okay. What are you doing? Hey! Hey! All right, all right, guys, guys, just cool it, okay? Look, she's hemorrhaging or something, right? What if she doesn't make it, huh? She's like that because of what we did to her, because of what we did together. I didn't do anything. Listen, if she dies, what, you think they're gonna just let us all walk away from this? I'm not taking the risk of going to prison over some stupid accident. Are you kidding me? Right? What the hell did you do, Kyle? Look, it was just supposed to shock them. Shock them? That son of a bitch knew exactly what would happen when I turned on those lights. Why would you do that to her? Hey! Hey, stop it! Stop it! Look, you could have killed them both. Look, you don't understand, all right? Everybody just stop. This isn't helping Beth, okay? I... Look, I'm really sorry for all of you, okay? I am, but I... Hey! Where the hell do you think you're going? Those are my keys! Hey, let him go. Let him go. He's taking my car, Adam. Look, we don't want to be seen in front of the house right now, okay? I'll get your car back, I promise. Get! Come on... Give me my phone, Adam. No, just.. Just wait. Okay? Wait. You're kidding me, right? Look, there's.. There's got to be a way that we can help Beth without hurting ourselves. Adam. Why don't we just leave her in front of the hospital? We could take your car and leave before anyone sees us. No, they got security cameras. I can't believe we're talking about this. Okay, how about.. How about we just.. We just find a pay phone somewhere down the road, okay? We'll call 911 from there, leave Beth, and tell them where to find her. That way.. That way no one sees anything, and they can't trace the call back to us. No, you can't be serious. Lindsay, this is Beth we're talking about. There's a pay phone near my place, on Sullivan Road where that old mechanic's garage is? It's all industrial out there, so at this time of night there won't be anyone else around. Yeah. This is crazy. Okay, this is crazy. This is crazy! I'm getting help. No, Megan, no. Lindsay. I'm sorry, but this our future we're talking about here. Megan. Make the call. No, what the hell are you doing? Look, none of this matters if Megan's not with us on this. Okay? Just... Look, Megan, if you want to throw the rest of our lives away, go ahead. Make the call. Okay, so.. So everyone agrees that we are going to wait until we know someone's coming for sure, right? Yeah, we won't leave until we hear sirens. What if Beth wakes up and tells them what happened? Look, just one thing at a time, okay? We'll cross that bridge when we get to it. Oh, my God. Is that Kyle? What? Come on... What the hell is he doing? Just let her die! Oh, Jesus. Oh, my God. Why is he doing this, Lindsay? I don't know, all right? Adam, get us out of here! I'm sorry, all right? I just can't let you save Beth! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, come on. I still have time. No, please, come on! No, no! Come on! Come on! Adam! No! No! No! What the hell just happened? Okay, it's done. Let's go get her. You guys, this is wrong. Yeah, well, so is spending the next 20 years in prison. Oh, no. What? What's wrong? Adam, what's the matter? I can't find my phone. I'd say that's the least of our worries right now. No, it has.. Has the video on it, okay? Everything from tonight, what happened to Beth. Did you leave it at the house? I don't.. I don't know. You don't know? Well, I'm sorry if I've been a little distracted, Wyatt. Okay, can everyone just calm down? Wyatt, please. Adam, it's fine, okay? I'll just.. I'll just call it. No, I.. I put it on silent so you wouldn't hear me inside the house. Well, that's just perfect. Maybe you dropped it in the car. Adam. Come on, come on. If someone finds that phone, we're all screwed. Tell me something I don't know. What kind of idiot loses something like that? Lindsay. Quiet. We need to go now. Ah. Ah! Ah... Come on, come on. Come on, come on! Oh, come on, come on. I don't have much time, and neither do you. I'm.. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for what happened to Beth, but now it's coming for all of you. You'll have until midnight the night before Halloween. If you.. If you don't do it by then... You die. I'm sorry. Okay. No. No. No, no, no, no, no! Ah. Tell me you've found that phone already. No. I've looked everywhere twice. What do we do? We can't pretend that we're not here. Whoever it is may have already heard us. We still haven't gotten our story straight. I can't answer it. Detective Burke, Middleton PD. Are you Lindsay Dwyer? I am not, no. I'm a friend. Hmm. Are parents home? They, um.. My parents are away for the weekend. Is there a problem? May I come in? Of course, please. Thank you. Hello. Hi. Beth Foster, her parents said that she was hanging out with you guys tonight. Yeah, yeah, she was. Why? Did something happen? Well, I was kind of hoping you guys could tell me that. I don't understand. Beth's in the hospital. Severe head trauma. Your friend's in a coma. Oh, my God. How? Somebody dumped her off at a garage on Sullivan Road. They just left her there unconscious. Yet they still phoned 911. Do you guys have any idea who might have done that? Wh.. I mean, she left here about two hours ago, I think, yeah. With Kyle, yeah, they took my car. Ah, Kyle. Now we're getting somewhere. Does this Kyle have a last name? Um. Uh, he.. He's new to our school. He just started last week. Yeah, so we don't.. We don't know him that well. Hmm, but Beth knew him? In a way. He means in a way that she wouldn't want her parents knowing, you know? Hmm. Yeah. So you didn't know Kyle, but you knew him well enough to lend him your car? I.. I didn't really.. I asked him to do it. Yeah, as a favor for Beth. Okay. Lindsay, is there something wrong with your hands in your pockets there? No, no, I, um.. I was just making fake blood for Halloween tomorrow night. Just, uh, can't seem to get the damn stuff off. Fake blood, huh? Excuse me. Of course. This is Burke. Megan, Megan, Megan. Megan, Megan, Megan. Yeah? What? Where? Adam... What kind of car you drive? Uh, it's.. It's an old wagon. Yeah, it's the kind with the fake wood on the sides. What? The blood. Mm-hmm, yup. Be there in a moment, okay? Well, looks like they found your car not far from where they found Beth. Car was crashed. Your good friend Kyle was nowhere to be found. You can pick up your car at the impound lot. Thanks. If you hear from this Kyle kid, you be sure to let me know. I'll see you guys around. Whatever happens, we stick to that story, yeah? Yeah. What? No. Help! Help! Help! Help! Please, someone, please! Ah, get me out. Adam, I will change my number again if you don't stop calling me, okay? Hello, Megan. Beth? We have a lot to talk about, Megan. I, um.. I need you to come see me. Today. I can't. I, uh.. I'm at school. I am halfway across the country. Then maybe I should talk with Detective Burke instead. No. No, no, no, I.. I will come. Good. I'm still at the hospital. Same room. Okay. Looking forward to it, Megan. Paging Dr. Stayton, Dr. Stayton, please. Paging Dr. Stayton, Dr. Stayton, please. Beth? Beth? You can't be in here. I know, um, I'm sorry. I went.. I went to the reception, but nobody came. Doesn't change the fact that you're not allowed in here. Right. Um... Was she awake today, this morning at any point? Awake? This girl's in a coma, has been for the last year. What exactly are you doing in here? I'm... Uh... I.. I don't see a phone in here. Why would she need a phone? Are you sure she hasn't woken up? Do I need to call security? No, no, I'm just saying maybe.. Maybe she did wake up, and you just don't know it. I might not know it, but those machines sure would. Now, I'm not gonna ask you again. Yeah, I, um.. I'm going. I'm going. Sorry. Okay, that's it. Get out. Go. I'm calling security. I'm going. Go. Okay. Okay. Oh. I'm so sorry. She called you too? Uh, someone called, but it wasn't Beth. What are you saying? Beth has already talked to the police? Beth hasn't talked to anyone. She's still in a coma, same as the last time we saw her. No, I talked to her on the phone this morning. It was her. No, it was definitely Beth. It couldn't have been. I just saw her. I talked to the nurse. If Beth had woken up, they'd know it. Then how do you explain the phone calls? I can't, okay? Look, someone is obviously messing with us. Someone else knows. Look... Maybe the cops found Kyle. Yeah, or they found your phone with that very informative video on it. Or it's the only one of us who isn't here right now. Wyatt's not picking up, and he's not answering my texts. When's the last time anyone's talked to him? I haven't talked to him since before I left for school. You, Lindsay? Don't ask me. I haven't talked to him since that wonderful night last year. I guess we've all gone out of our way to keep our distance from each other. I guess we just want to forget. What is this? This is where Wyatt wanted to meet? What the hell did he do? Oh, my God, that's Kyle's hoodie. Oh, come on, how can you be so sure? I gave it to him, all right? It's his. Lindsay, we shouldn't be here. I need to know, okay? One sec. Miss Dwyer. Will you look at this? The whole gang's practically here, huh? What brings you all back in town? Is it him? Is it Kyle? I'm afraid I can't release that information, at least not yet, but here's what I can tell you. The person that we found back there, well, he didn't exactly die in a car accident. No, no. Based on the clothing, that body met a much more unfortunate end. Now, I'm just spitballing here, but... Maybe the person who did this was exacting revenge for a wronged friend. Hmm? We've told you already, many times, we never saw Kyle after he left the house that night. Let's go. Please just indulge me. I know you're in a rush. You know what I find very interesting? That the very day that I get an anonymous phone call telling me exactly where I can find this body, you three show up back in town at the exact same location. Now, I'm sure you can see how that.. That looks suspicious. Okay, now it's time to go. Okay. Seeing as you three are back in town, I suggest you stick around. I have a feeling we're gonna need to talk again. Did you hear what he said? Kyle didn't die from that accident. Someone killed him. Yeah, and he thinks we did it. Okay, first Beth, and now this? What the hell is going on? What the hell is Wyatt doing? Let's just.. Let's just get out of here, okay? Wyatt? Start the car. I said start the car now! Okay. You know, if you three hadn't ignored me for the past year, if you had returned just one phone call, one text, you wouldn't be about to die. I said drive! Okay, everyone in. Go. Okay. Move! Okay! Wyatt, just.. Just stop, okay? Just stop. Why are we here? Needed somewhere we won't be disturbed. Just in case anyone gets any ideas, if someone runs, Megan never leaves. Okay, hey, hey, hey, just.. Just relax, okay? Don't tell me to relax! Okay. Wait. You have no idea the world of hurt you're in right now, so don't you tell me to relax. Adam, it's okay. It's okay, okay? It's okay. It's okay. Are you okay? I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm fine. What is this? Found that under the seat of my wagon when I finally got it back from the shop. It's Kyle's. You remember Kyle, don't you? Go ahead, turn it on. What is going on, Wyatt? If one of you had bothered answering just one of my calls, you would already know what's going on! Please don't hurt me! Now turn it on.. Okay. And play the video message. Okay. It's on. It's on, okay? Okay. You... I don't have much time, okay? And neither will you. I'm.. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for what happened to Beth, but now it's coming for all of you. I don't know how this started, but I know that the only way to be free from it is to trick somebody into killing someone else. The killer or anyone who had anything to do with it has one year to do the same. One.. One year to pass it on. You.. You'll have until midnight the night before Halloween. If you don't do it by then... You die. This.. This is all some kind of joke, right? This is no joke, trust me. Okay, wait, I don't understand. Kyle.. Kyle tried to hurt Beth on purpose? He was.. He was trying to kill her? And he tricked me into doing it. But Beth didn't die. And so Kyle did. Guys, just.. Just hold on here a second, okay? You guys are all talking as if what Kyle said was all true. This guy was obviously a psychopath. Then what killed him? Some other screwed-up nut job. Okay, look, wait. Even if what Kyle was saying was true, it.. It's obviously not. Beth is still alive. Kyle would have failed. It wouldn't have been passed on to us. She's been clinically brain dead for the past month. Wyatt, I saw her today. She was still breathing. Doctors can't explain it. It's why her parents won't pull the plug. And why should we trust anything you're saying? For all we know, you're the one who killed Kyle. Wyatt. Wyatt, wait. Don't. Wyatt, stop. Hey, hey. Wyatt, hey. Wyatt! This was the only way I could be sure you guys would listen to me. That was a real asshole move, do you know that? Do you know that? Sorry. It's been a rough year. After all the calls that you made, why didn't you leave us a message, Wyatt? Why didn't you tell us what was going on? Would you have believed me? You don't even believe me now. "Now you know my secret, and I know yours. "I have Adam's phone. One hour until the fun begins." We all got the same text. In one hour it'll be midnight. October 30th. The night before Halloween. All I'm saying is maybe going back to the hospital isn't the smartest idea. Maybe we should just leave, forget about this whole thing. No, we can't just leave, okay? Someone has my phone. That doesn't end well for any of us. Who says that leaving will make any difference, anyway? Look, somebody is obviously pranking us, okay? It's as simple as that. You just don't get it, do you? It lured you back here. Yeah, right. You were there that night. Why didn't you get a call? It didn't call me because I already dealt with it. What do you mean you dealt with it? You know, I used to be so envious of you guys, the way you were able to just pick up and move on with your lives like nothing ever happened. No, that's not true, Wyatt. Yeah? That's not true. Well, you made it pretty clear none of you were interested in knowing me anymore. It's not like I could tell anyone else, so I got real close with my good friends, Benny, Oxy, Codeine. What did you do, Wyatt? I owed my dealer a lot of money. He started threatening me, you know, that he was coming after me, and I saw an opportunity, and I took it. Him or me, right? You didn't. I told my dealer his supplier was coming after him. I told his supplier my dealer was gonna rip him off, and they took care of the rest. So they're both dead? Yeah. Oh, my God. Wyatt, it was just a prank. Somebody's just messing with us. 11:33. I guess we'll see soon enough which one of us is right. Hi, uh, we're here to visit our grandfather. We won't be long. Excuse me. Excuse me. Hey, excuse me. Excuse me, visiting hours are over. You can't be up here. See if Adam's phone is here. See if any phone is here. Yeah, I'm not seeing a phone anywhere. Well, then keep looking. Beth? Beth? Beth? I know that you can hear me. Beth! Megan? Ah! Wyatt! Oh, my God. Ah... Get out of here, Megan! I'm trying! You can't kill me. Can you? Ah! Ah! Go! Get out of here, Megan! Ah! Ah! Open this door. Open it right now. Open this door. Open the door right now. Let me try. Megan? Wyatt, what's going on? Megan, open the door! Megan! Megan! Megan! Ah! Megan, come on! What's going on? Ah! What's going on? Megan! Open the door! Wyatt! Megan! Megan, open the door! Megan! Megan! We have to go! We have to go right now! Stop her! What are you doing? Go after them! Want to load it right here?- Okay. Ready to go? Okay, back it up. She seemed under the impression that the girl had woken up at some point, sometime this morning. Had she? That girl had been brain dead for the last two weeks. She was never waking up. I'd like to go home now if that's okay. My husband's waiting downstairs. Yeah, of course. Give me a call if you think of anything, okay? Thank you. You know, um... She did ask if there was a phone in the room. She seemed pretty worked up about it. Like she thought maybe that someone had made a call from the room? I couldn't say. I'll call if I think of anything else. Yeah, thank you. I just checked with maintenance. There's no leak in that ceiling. They say there's no reason for that stain to be there. Let me ask you a question. Do you think that a 120-pound girl could throw a 170-pound boy through that window? No, not likely. Maybe the kid jumped. Why sneak into a hospital with three other people only to throw yourself out a window? Did you get a good look at that kid? Who knows what the hell he was on? Walker, suspect's been spotted in the south wing. The lieutenant wants you to check it out. Copy that. Don't tell me what I did and didn't see. Yeah, but.. But that means that.. That this is all.. Real? No. No, guys, it can't be. This can't be real. Look, that.. That thing that killed Wyatt, that was real, okay? Those flies that crawled out of Beth, that was real. Whoever's calling us and texting us, that is sure as hell real. If what Kyle said is true, okay, and it is real, then... There's only one way out of it. I won't be able to do it. I just won't. So you're willing to just let yourself die? I won't be responsible for someone else's death. Yeah, well, I have plans, all right? So if someone else has to die tonight so that I won't, then so be it. Look, just wait, okay? There has to be another way. I know what I have to do, all right? You two can do whatever the hell you want. I'm getting out of here. Don't move! Don't move! Ah! Go back! Go! Let's go, let's go, let's go! Police! Police! Stay where you are! Stay where you are! Get in there! This way, now! Wait, Adam, what are you doing? I'll lead it away. Go! No, Adam, please! Go! Just Go! Adam, please! Adam! Go, we have to go. We can't leave him! Megan, please! We have to go! We have to go! Stop now! Get down on the ground. Get down on the ground now. Please. I'm sorry. No, no, no, no, no. Please. You can't do this! You can't put me in here. Please. Listen to me! You don't understand! No! Moore, are you there? This is Moore. Yeah, look, we searched the entire basement. There's no sign of that boy down here anywhere. You don't understand! It's gonna kill me! Two phones. Busy girl. Busy indeed. You've had quite the night since we last spoke. You can turn around. Look, there is a video on the red phone, okay? It will explain everything. It's funny you should mention that, because, uh, I have a video of my own that I would like to show you. We found your boyfriend's phone in Kyle's pocket tonight. Yeah, it needed a little cleaning up, good charge, but now it's as good as new. You don't understand. You don't know how fortunate it is in my line of work that you kids these days seem to want to record just about everything. It's a real help, isn't it, detective? Yeah, it could almost put us out of a job. Yeah. The knives! Go, get the knives! Okay, please, please just let me explain, okay? So please explain. Beth, the knives! No, please, someone! Help me! No, no, no, no, no, no! Get me out of here! Get me out of here! No! Get me out of here! Get her out of the car! Get me out of here! Get me out of here! Hey! Stop! She's got a gun! Look, she's got a gun! Stop! Gun! No, no, no, it's just a phone! It's just a phone! No! No. Why would you want your best friend dead? Ah! Adam. 13-80, 61.. You're alive. We have to go now. Come on. Hey! Hey! Stop! You can't do this, okay? If you leave me in here, I'm gonna die! Why aren't you listening to me? I will never make it through the night! Does my dying not matter to anyone? God! God. Think we should call a doctor? No, let's start with her parents. Hello? Look, I want a lawyer. Do you hear me? I want a lawyer, assholes! Come on! God! I want a lawyer. I know my rights. It's gonna be a little bit difficult to get at 4:00 in the morning. Of course, you don't have to talk to me without your lawyer present. That's your right. But that means you're gonna be sitting in this room for quite some time. Is that what you want? I want to leave. Answer some of my questions, and maybe we can arrange that. You'll let me go? Where is it that you're so desperate to go this time of night, huh? Look, you wouldn't understand. Okay. Help me understand. Help me understand why it is that you tried tricking someone into killing your friend. Self-preservation. Because you were worried about Megan spilling the beans about the night that Beth got hurt? Lindsay, it doesn't matter anymore. I've seen the video. Let me ask you a question. Okay. All those flies that were in the car with me tonight, where is it you think they all came from? Hmm. Well, the car was parked over a sewer. I presume they just came straight up through there. Where is it that you think they came from? You wouldn't believe me if I told you. Try me. Okay. Can you hold that thought? God. Come on. No... No... Her parents don't even know she's back from school? No idea, but they were adamant. They don't want anyone talking to her until they get here with a lawyer. When's that gonna be? They're out of town themselves, so it's gonna be a little while. Okay. Well, I guess we can let her stew for a while. Let's concentrate on finding the other two in the meantime. Oh, and we should bring in their parents too while we're at it. Uh, Wyatt's mother is here too. Be there in a minute. Ah! Reese, get me first aid in here! Ah! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. It's okay. I'm almost done. Okay. Breathe. Ah! Sorry. That is the last time, I swear. Okay. Look, I'm just, uh... I'm just glad you're here. I am sorry I pushed you away. I am sorry for everything. It's okay. It's okay. It's not, though, and now I'll never have the time to make it right. You just did. I can't.. I can't do it. I can't trade someone else's life for mine. Me neither. So what? What do we do? We just.. We wait? We wait for it to come get us? ♪ Let's get you finished up. It's all they had. We could try to kill it. It's not like we have anything else to lose, right? How would we do that? I don't know. I don't know. We could try to trap it somehow. We should burn the son of a bitch. Got her? Up. There. No... What is that? No! Right there. No. No! Those are flies. There is not a single fly in this entire room. Yeah, I'm not surprised given all the activity. Did you know that she asked me where I thought all those flies in the car came from tonight? Hell, maybe I'm wrong. Wrong about what? What.. What are you saying, Burke? I'm saying there's two dead tonight, plus we have a third body, and all of them were there the night that Beth was hurt. Yeah, and those kids will do anything to cover up what they did to that girl. This one tried to have her friend shot, for Christ sakes. No, no, I'm missing something. Look, you said it yourself. She broke free. She climbed onto the desk, and she jumped. You saw how desperate she was to get out of here. Yeah, she jumped, just like Wyatt jumped. This is Reese. Uh-huh. There's a unit at Industrial and 57th. They think they spotted our two teens. They're siphoning gas out of the cars in the parking lot over there. Gas? What the hell are they planning? Ah! Ah! Heads up. Okay, be careful. The top of this one's leaking, okay? Don't get gas on yourself. Yeah, you should have let me do that. Have you taken a look at yourself? I don't think so. You know, we could get the rest up through the hatch if I can get it open. What do you mean if? Adam, that is our only way out of here. Look, don't worry. I'll get it open. Okay, so I mean, what's the plan? How are we.. How are we gonna get it in here? We don't need one. Look, we both know it's coming for us, so you and me, we just wait down here, and when it comes for us, we light the gas and hightail it down through the hatch. Fingers crossed. Nothing to lose, right? Yeah, nothing to lose. Okay, let's go, move, move, move. I want all the exits covered, fire and EMT standing by. Set up a line here, all right? Adam! Adam! Please, my.. My son is in there. What the hell are they doing here? Must have followed us from the station. I want everyone to stay back! Excuse me, Ma'am, you made a mistake. Megan! Megan! No one gets in here without my say-so. Piece of cake. Okay. Okay, I got it, I got it, I got it. Okay. You gonna come down now? Hey, hey, listen to me. It's gonna work out. I.. I know that. Okay. Okay. Adam! Megan? Adam! Megan! It's here! Adam! Adam! Adam! Adam! Megan! Do it now! Adam! Ah! Megan! Megan! Megan! No! Ah! It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Wait. Where did it go? Maybe it knows. Adam! Adam! Adam! Adam! Adam! Adam! Ah! Adam! Go! Go! Go! Thanks. You good? Yeah. Go! Go! Burke! Adam! Megan! Are you all right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. Megan! Everybody stay back.
