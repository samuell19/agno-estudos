Are you ready? We're ready. Ready to forget once and for all. Good, Mr Lambert. So then, close your eyes. Both of you. Now take a deep breath. Now feel yourselves getting sleepier and sleepier. Neither of you will remember the last year. There is no place called The Further. You will only remember Dalton's coma. And his recovery. And let the darkness drift further... and further away. For everything, there is a season. A time to be born... and a time to die. A time to kill... a time to heal. A time to keep... and a time to throw away. A time to weep... and a time to laugh. A time to mourn, and a time to dance. A time for silence... and a time to speak. A time for love... and a time to hate. A time for war, and a time for peace. Amen. Amen. We therefore commit this body to the ground. Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust. Amen. It was a beautiful service for a beautiful grandma. She loved you guys so much. Your mother was a fine friend, Josh. Thank you. I miss Grandma. I know she misses you too, Kali. Dead people don't miss anything. Okay, that's not true, and she does miss you. See you guys next weekend, okay? Dalton. Dalton! -See what I mean? -He's just anxious about leaving. For school next week. I know. Yeah, no. Um... Thank you for organising all this. I just haven't had the bandwidth. Why don't you drive him to school? You have a few weeks until all your students show up. -Nah, he wouldn't want me to. -He's not the parent, you are. If you don't want to, then that's a different story, but-- No, I can't. Why? Wh-- It was just an idea. Maybe some way that you guys could connect, that's all. He's gonna be gone soon, so... Anyway, think about it. Bye. See you, man. Excuse me. Excuse me. Hey. Do I know you? I knew your mother. Years ago. Um... But we lost touch. What's your name? Carl. Nice to meet you, Carl. Appreciate you coming. I'm sorry I grabbed you. -I got a lot on my mind. -I'm sure. Death floods the mind with memory. But there's always new ones to make, right? Yeah. Bye, Josh. Carl. Carl. Uh... What did you just tell me? Well, just tell me, Dalton. Or change it? Do you wanna clean--? Do you wanna keep the same diaper on? Yeah? I tell you what. We can just clean out the diaper and then put the same diaper back on. Would you like that? You like that? Okay, I'll do that, then. What kind of outfit do you want? Oh... oop. - Oop. What kind of outfit do you want? Yeah? Well, tell me. All you got to do is talk to me. Come on. It's the greatest guy in the world. Oh, shit. Uh... I mean... Yeah, great. All right. Okay.

This what you been working on? -Put it back. -No, it's really good. Did you do this from memory? It's from a photo I found at the house. Wow, looks like she's, uh... Like she's hiding something? That's what it feels like. Felt like. The last few years. She had a tough go, you know, being a single mom. Yeah, yeah, that's... Yeah, that's tough. Guess I didn't make the wall, huh? I don't blame you. You know, I'm sorry I haven't been around lately. Of course, my dad wasn't around at all, but... So it could be a lot worse. I've just been a little foggy past few years. I don't know, my brain just... I just... haven't been able to manage a time for, uh, you and your brother and sister. Have you ever thought about getting help? I'm just trying to push through. -Are you Dalton Lambert? -Yeah. Are you...? Chris Winslow. -Everything cool, fellas? -Yeah, no, everything's fine. I just-- I thought my roommate would be a, um... Um... Uh, a guy. Yeah. Oh. I just figured it's a liberal arts school, and we mean "liberal." Yeah, probably just confused by the name "Chris." Right. 'Cause that would never happen with a name like "Dalton." You know, I'm gonna go down to the housing office and get this all sorted out. No, no, no. Please, father of Dalton. Allow me. I clearly interrupted some boy bonding. I'll be back. Hey. Uh... I snagged this for you. You should check it out. If you hate it, no worries. But you're not gonna hate it. You really don't know me, do you? I mean, you really think I wanna join a frat? It's just a party, Dalton. Go. Have fun. I mean, do it for me. I drove you here. -You didn't even want to. -Of course I did. Stop lying to me! I heard what Mom said at the funeral. Well, I still did it. Oh, so that makes you father of the year now? At least you've got a father. Stop blaming your dad for shit you screwed up. He left like 40 years ago. Get over it. God knows I'm not gonna be defined by you. Are you kidding me? After all we have done for you? When did you become this ungrateful, little shit? No wonder Mom divorced you. Thanks for the ride. You can tell it's Shania Twain, right? Yeah. So, what'd they say at housing? They said, "Tough titties." I got to sleep here tonight. But I'll get a new room tomorrow, so it's not a permanent thing. Heartbreak, right? -You're in the art school, I take it? -Yeah. Are you music? Math. I thought about music, but the artist's life is one of nomadic instability and much gnashing of teeth. But I'm sure you'll be super successful. -You wanna blow my hooter? -What? Do you play? Oh. -Uh, just a little piano. -It's the same thing. Just blow. My cooties are good cooties. What's that? It's just something my mom wrote. Sweet. So... what's some weird shit about you? I don't know. Uh... "I don't know." Come on, man. Everybody's weird. You first. On Sundays, I wear a monocle and I order takeout with a British accent. That is weird. Thank you. Okay, sometimes I eat instant oatmeal, uh, with no, like, water or milk or anything. It's just kind of dry. You're bad at this. Let's try again. When I was 10, my parents died, and I went to go live with my Grandma Perkee, who once went almost nearly blind from a gnarly case of athlete's foot. I don't remember when I was 10. Like, the whole year. What do you mean? I was in a coma. Viral meningitis. At least that's what they told me, the few times that they would talk about it. But I don't remember anything. I don't even remember being sick. It's like I woke up one day and a whole year had passed. That's awful. And pretty weird. Well done. Yeah, honestly, I wish I could have forgotten a whole year when I was a kid. Could've used a little "meningi-gi." Uh... you know, there is one more weird thing about me. Um, ever since my coma, I've been afraid of the dark. I was afraid of Barbie dolls till I was, like... now. There's nothing wrong with being scared. Just as long as you don't keep me up with some bright-ass night light. Um... -Seriously? -Sorry. Oh, man. Whatever. It's fine. I'll deal. Hey, this is Dalton. I can't get to the phone right now, so leave me a message and I'll give you a call back. Hey, bud. It's me. Just making sure you're getting settled in okay. Um... I was just, uh, thinking about what you said... and, um... I don't know. I don't know what's going on with me, but, um... I'm gonna find out. And I just wanted you to know that. Okay, bye. Hello. I am Professor Armagan. Shut off your phones. Open your portfolios. Pull out something that will interest me. Pin it to your easel. Stand beside your work. Stand proud. Alec Anderson. Your technique is obvious. -It looks like a photograph. -Thanks. That wasn't a compliment. Tear it up. Excuse me? The drawing. Tear it up. I worked my ass off on this piece. No one will miss it. No way. Alas, our first casualty. Usually, I go through introductions before someone quits. -I didn't quit. -Yes, you did. You just haven't realised it yet. You can go. Good luck. Any fool can learn technique. Even master it. It doesn't mean anything if it doesn't come from inside. I am not interested in the "rules of art." We are going to break the rules. Then I want you to break them again. See how broken you can get. Dalton Lambert. Yes, ma'am? Why in the hell would you destroy a beautiful drawing like that? Once more for good measure? Wasn't so hard, was it? Good. You must let go of your past. Shed your skin in order to grow. I'll count backwards from ten. With each number, I want you to sink further and further into yourself. Do not lift the charcoal from the paper. Ten... nine... eight, seven, six... five... four, three, two... one. Draw whatever your soul brings forth. An experience that defines you. You've got to be willing to dredge up your ugliest, innermost thoughts. Is it keeping you in or out? You'll have headphones on. The machine is quite loud, but you'll be able to hear me. I'm going to need you to stay as still as possible throughout the procedure. If you feel like you need to get out of there, give the call ball a squeeze, we'll give you a break. You good? Overjoyed. All aboard. Hit this. Okay. You comfortable, Josh? Yep. Let's just get this over with. Hello? Dr Brower? Dr Brower? There's someone with you. What? What did you say? Dr Brower, what did you say? Wh-- Come on. Um... Okay, can you let me out, please? Hello, hey! Can you let me out? The door is open. Okay, okay. Let me out. Let me out. Hey! Dr Brower. Dr Brower, let me out. Come on. Get me out of here. Hello? Hey! Just let me out. Let me out, let me out, let me out. Dr Brower. Come on. Let me out. Okay. Come on. Mr Lambert? -What was that? What was that? -Are you okay? -Who was that? Why did the lights go out? -Calm down. You said the lights went out? All the lights went out and I got stuck in there, man. And I saw... -What... -Mr Lambert, you've been asleep for 15 minutes. You went right out. Your MRI went perfectly. -What? -Take your time to get dressed. Come on through. There's nothing physically wrong with you. No growths or spots on the brain. Nothing to be concerned about. That's good news, Mr Lambert. Yeah, no, I know, I, uh... I guess I was just hoping for something real. Something that could explain this fog. The memory issues you're talking about, they could be spurred on by a number of things. Increased stress, change in daily habits. Have there been any disruptions in your home life? My, uh, mom passed away recently. I'm sorry for your loss. Not to mention my son left for school, and, uh, my ex-wife hardly talks to me, so... -That certainly sounds stressful. -Yeah. Maybe a grief counsellor be of some help? Yeah. Sure. Probably would. Do you have any history of mental illness in your family? Mental illness? It's nothing to be alarmed about. It can be informative as we try to make a diagnosis. Not that I'm aware of. It's worth looking into. Meanwhile, there are exercises, games you can do to stimulate your memory. Matching games. Like kids do. You want me to play kids' games? We can learn a lot from kids. Yeah. Thanks. Whatcha doin'? Got my new room assignment today. So, alas, no more panty parties. But consolation, I'm in 323 now. Right above you. So be cautious, young man, lest I hear you slap your sausage in the dead of night. -You want to join a frat? -What? Oh. No, it's just something my dad got me. We should go. We can make fun of their khaki pants and trust funds. Unless you're not done redecorating. Come on, Dolphin. Do something nice for your old man. What's the worst that could happen? May I offer you some diaper pudding? Uh, I'm good. Oh, no. Whatever. Seriously? Oh, come on. Quit your bitching and come here. To memorialize the night that Dalton Lambert actually has fun! Go! Go! Go! What's "frat juice"? - Don't ask. - Hey, hey, hey! Everyone, my name's Nick. Nick the Dick! Nick the Dick! Nick the Dick! Welcome to the Kappa House, and welcome back to school, baby. I'm just here to remind you fine folks that frats, they're under attack. Right, and we must protect our right to party and to be awesome. White, Black, brown, or blue, you're all welcome at JPU, provided that you recognise and respect that the frat house is the last house where men can still be men. Whoo! Thank you. Now, we got a lot of drinking to do tonight, but pace yourselves. We do not need another incident. This party's lame. Confirmed. So let's go upstairs and look through everyone's shit. ♪ But you came right on time Can we turn off all these lights? ♪ ♪ Can I roll up, get a lil' high? Every time I look in your eyes ♪ ♪ I look away mesmerised ♪ ♪ And you shine brighter than the stars That decorate the night sky... ♪ Yeah. We should make this quick. Permission to proceed granted. Wait. Huh. Oh. Wow. Oh, no. This is Nick's room. And this is Nick's butthole cream. I'm going to go spread this on the communal crapper. BRB. Wait. Hey, man... Hey, man, you okay? You need water or something? Make it stop. Make it stop. Make it stop. Close the door. Close the... Close the door! I'll be right back. I just need some supplies. Hey, Paige. I am Nick. ♪ Tonight is your night, bro Tonight is the night ♪ Got you. Come on, man. Just be you, bro. You want to dance? A dance would be nice. We can dance. Let's dance. ♪ Tonight is the night, bro ♪ Be quiet! Are you good? I think I just saw something... What? We need to go. -Now. -But this is just getting fun. - Is somebody in my room? - Shit, shit, shit. One of you peckerwoods is about to get the hammer drop. What the hell? Oh, my God. So sorry. We were just looking for some privacy, you know? We were gonna do it. I'd rather watch my parents do it. But you should stick around. We might get drunk enough to find you attractive. Even though you look like a clown. Nick the Dick, huh? I'm more partial to kick the dick. Oh! Run! That was pretty quick thinking back there, right? I, uh... Oh, crap. I should've asked before I kissed you, right? I am sorry. I was just... I was going on instinct. -Oh, no... -Are you okay? I'm fine. It's just, I, um... I'm just sorry for what he said to you. Oh. Whatever. You think I care what Vineyard Vines thinks? He should be so lucky. Hey, buddy, it is, uh, me again. Um, I went to the doctor. Um, and everything's okay. Well, not okay. But I'm getting to the bottom of it. So, uh, just give me a call when you can. All right, I, uh... I'm really sorry, Dalton, about what I said the other day. All right, bye. Where's my mayonnaise? Who is it? Please don't tell me you're really just a creep. What? No. Then what the hell is going on? Come on in. Something's happening to me. I'm seeing things, crazy things. You know that kid at the frat house that they talked about, with the incident? -Uh-huh. -I saw him. And he was dead. It started with an art exercise, and she asked us to dig deep into a memory, into our subconscious. So I did and I drew this door. You really need to lay off the frat juice. I'm serious. Tonight, I was painting and I fell asleep. And when I woke up, this lantern appeared. It was like a dream, but it wasn't a dream. And then I walked to your room. I know how this sounds. I feel like I'm getting closer to something. Or something's getting closer to me. You got an extra pillow? Okay. Foster. Renai. Dalton. Kali. Dalton. Dalton? Dalton. Mom. Okay. Okay, Mom, help me out. Kali. Dalton. Dalton. Mom. Mom? Mom. I don't know. I don't know. Okay. Damn it. Chiaroscuro. The dance of light and shadow. An effect used not only to create volume and definition, but also a specific, unseen light source. Right. This is one of Goya's best. The negative space draws our eyes towards Saturn. Does it represent darkness or some void? Goya mastered it on the canvas, but family problems and health issues sent this once-revered court painter into a dark spiral, leading him to create this grisly portrait of a father devouring his son. This balance between light and dark is what we're after. Get ready. Your own experiences shape your artwork. Embrace them. Use them. Sink deep into the darkness of memory. Ten... nine... eight... seven... six... five... four... three... two... one... - 'Sup, nerd? -A red door. Uh, a purple pecker. Come on, man. Doesn't that mean anything to you? A red door? You sound weirder than usual. It's a thing from art class. It's a painting. We had to find a memory. I thought it was something from our childhood. Did you ask Mom? No, I don't want to worry her. Why would that worry her? -I don't know. -This what happens when you go to college? You get all cryptic and shit? I guess. Well, I'm not going, then. So after the whole spooky dream-not-a-dream thing the other night, I started thinking: "Yeah, okay, Dalton's a weirdo, but he's not insane, right?" I'm gonna need that key back. Right. So I started poking around the old interwebs... and guess what? You're not crazy at all. You are an astral projector. Check this out. Looks like they filmed it in between shifts at Best Buy. Hey, guys, this is Spectral Sightings. I'm Specs, this is Tucker. Say hi, Tucker. -No. -Okay. We are PPI, Professional Paranormal Investigators. Today, we're gonna be talking about something that dozens of you have been asking us about. -Astral projection. -Astral projection. It's a real phenomenon. Our physical body falls asleep and our astral body leaves that physical body... and floats off into another realm. -That's exactly what it feels like. -See, I told you. It's cool, right? Our former mentor, Dr Elise Rainier, she had a name for this other realm. -She called it The Further. -Hold on. I am Elise. It's nice to see you all. So I'm here to talk to you about astral projection... and The Further. Okay... give me a minute here. Three... two... one. The Further... is a dark realm... filled with tortured souls of the dead... and some are doomed... to live the worst mistakes of their lives over and over and over for all eternity. When you astral project... or you travel to this realm... these are the souls... that you awaken with your presence. They can smell you. The presence of life. Life is what they crave, more than anything. So the further you travel... the riskier the journey becomes. They want life, and they can come to our world to get it. Keep a steady stride. I see those gears turning. What is it? -That kid from the frat house? -The pukey kid? Yeah. He said something to me. He said, "Close the door." I'm sure he did. It probably wasn't his proudest moment. Yeah, but what if he meant something else? What if he was talking about this door? So, what? You want to go back and ask him? Seriously? I need to know. Look, I feel bad for the dude, I do, but dark realms are typically places I try to avoid. There's something important about this painting, Chris. I have to find out. Okay. It's not like Nick the Dick is just gonna let you waltz into his bedroom and chat with the ghost in his toilet. He'll never know I'm there. So, what's the plan? - I got this. - Can I help you? Hello. I have left my brassiere in Nicholas's room, and I was wondering if he is perchance home? I think he's upstairs studying with Paige. Great job, Dolphin. I'm gonna read you this. It's called In Flames. Very vulnerable piece. "Looking across a campfire..." I need a room with darkness. Okay. Then what? You gonna float through the air and do a little "Ooh"? I'm not like a ghost. And you never will be with that attitude, Casper. Bingo. What are the chances those bedsheets are crusty? Probably snap like a taco shell. I'll take the dirty floor. Okay... -Can you give me a little space, please? -Oh, yeah. Sorry. Okay, you ready? Ten, nine... eight, seven... six, five... four, three... two, one. Are you floating yet? Farewell, traveller. You out here, Dalton? ...creative writing double major. But I'm also crazy good at finance, so I don't want to waste that gift. How long do you have to keep that on? Oh. Yeah, it's good now. My pores are good. Oh. I'm gonna be a while. Gross. Dalton? Dalton. Someone turn on the lights! Dalton. Dalton. Dalton, wake up. - Guys! Seriously. - Chris. Guys, who's messing with me? Close the door! Close the door! Dalton? - Close the door! - Chris! Oh, God. Come on! Chris. What...? Come on. What? Chris. -Chris. Hey. I didn't mean it like that... -Don't. I just wanted to see if you're okay. I'm okay. I'm sorry. I didn't know anyone could get hurt in the real world. Well, they can. You have no idea what you're messing with. I can't be a part of this, Dalton. And neither should you. Because next time, you might not wake up. -Hey. -Hi. Uh, it's not your weekend. Kali's at a sleepover and Foster's... I'm not here for the kids. Can we talk? Sure. Wow, two calls in one week. - Come on, man. - Haven't you made any friends yet? Tell me everything you remember about my coma. You should talk to Mom. I think these... -things I'm drawing, they... -The door? And now a guy with a hammer. -A hammer? -I think they could be clues from my past, thoughts that have disappeared 'cause of my coma. -I don't know why they're coming out now-- -Wait. Dalton. What is it? I've had this image in my mind for years. Mom always says it's not real. It's just a bad dream. But... Tell me, little brother. Come on. Okay. We're in a room somewhere. Like a basement. You remember that? Dalton, you there? All I ever wanted was to be better than my father. You know that. Just to be a good dad. You were. You are, Josh. Well, Dalton would disagree. Well, if it's any consolation, I can't even get him to call me back. My dad abandoned his family, and... I've done the same thing. No, you haven't. You're not him, Josh, and you're allowed to be angry at him. I am angry. I've been angry for a long time. Angry at a man that I have never met. Angry at a man that jumped off the roof of a mental hospital in 1978. For more than 40 years, that man has been dead and gone. My dad. Ben Burton. So how in the hell is he terrorizing me here, now, in the real world? -He attacked me at Mom's place... -He attacked you? Yeah. So am I just crazy, or...? I don't know. He, uh... left this for my mom the day he died. What ends with him? -Josh... -Is that the answer? Am I just crazy? Is his madness inside of me? Is that why I've been so lost the past few years? Did I pass this curse on to our kids? Is he gonna haunt them... -Josh, Josh. -...like he haunted me? Why didn't my mother say anything about this? Stop. You're not crazy. You're not crazy. Then what's happening to me? Dalton. So Dalton and I could travel to some other... dimension... where we were haunted by ghosts and goblins. More like entities, like the one in those photos that haunted you. And your father, he saw them too, and... Maybe he's just reaching out. Back then, he told your mom. She didn't understand. -She didn't know how to help him. -Help him like you helped us? By suppressing our memories? We all thought it was for the best, Josh. You included. But you got foggy. The suppression, it slowed you down. And your mom and I, we didn't know what to do. And I was too scared to tell you the truth. Dalton was right. He said my mom had secrets, that she was hiding something from us. I just never thought you did too. -For ten years... -You have no idea... -...you have kept this away from me. -...how hard it has been for me. -Just why? Why? Why? -You don't understand-- Because you tried to kill our family. You chased us around the house with a goddamn baseball bat! -What? -I mean, I knew that it wasn't you. I knew it was that... thing in those photos, but the kids? They don't understand. All those night terrors that Foster had. I've been lying to our children for a decade, telling them those memories aren't real. "They're just your imagination. Dad's not gonna hurt you." -I couldn't. -But you did. Doesn't matter to them what was controlling you. What they saw was your face. It was you who was causing all that pain. That's why I pulled away. I just... I couldn't live like that anymore. You know... we could've gotten through this together. Is this you? Dalton just sent this to me. He's been having nightmares and visions. Something about a red door. And now this. What do we do? I'm scared. It's gonna be okay. - It's gonna be okay. - I don't know... It's okay. Nothing's gonna happen to us. I promise you, okay? Take care of your brother, Dalton. Okay. Here. But why is Daddy mad at us? Mommy. Mommy... I can go into the dark place and find Daddy. - No, it's too dangerous. - I can do it, though. Okay, just be careful. Come on. No! Stop! What are you doing? Stop! What are you doing? Dad, please, just stop. Just stop! No! Stop! And now, my dear friends, I'd like to dedicate this song to all of you out there. Wherever you may be, this song is for you. ♪ Fill your heart with love today ♪ ♪ Don't play the game of time ♪ ♪ Things that happened in the past ♪ ♪ Happened in your mind ♪ ♪ In your mind, only in your mind ♪ ♪ In your mind ♪ ♪ Forget your mind and you'll be free ♪ Just checking on you. Okay. Sitting on the floor, being weird. That's normal. So you're good, right? Because... I thought that when the power went out, that maybe you were messing with that dark realm shit again. And I know that you don't really care for the dark. So I figured... I would illuminate your room, much like how I illuminate your life. I'm not afraid of the dark anymore. Okay. Well, I hauled these all the way down here, so they're going up anyway. Even though you're totally freaking annoying. So, um, listen... I got your text and I wrote a snarky response. And then I deleted it, because Grandma Perkee always told me to never escalate an argument over text. Doesn't convey tone. But, I mean, if you want my opinion... here it is. Don't go digging around in your past. Some things are just better left buried, you know? And... sometimes you just have to move on. Dalton? Hey. Dalton. You okay? ♪ Knee-deep in flowers, we'll stray ♪ ♪ We'll keep the showers away ♪ ♪ And if I kiss you in the garden ♪ ♪ In the moonlight ♪ ♪ Will you pardon me? ♪ ♪ And tiptoe through the tulips with me? ♪ Dalton. Dalton. Dalton? Dalton? No. Oh, no! No, no, no! Daddy's here. I'm gonna get you out of this place, Dalton. We're gonna get out of here and we're gonna get home, okay? We're never going back there. Dalton. What? Dalton. Dalton, tell me you're in there. Dalton. Dalton, I know you're in there. But if you touch me again, I'm gonna fuck you up. Dad, no! You tried to kill me. -It wasn't me. -I saw you! Dalton, these things, they can possess our bodies. It happened to me, and now he's done it to you. He's coming back for you. We've got to go. Come on. He's coming! Go! Dalton, help me! Help me hold the door! - No! - We can't hold it back, Dad. Son, we got to try. Go, get away! No! No! No! Dalton, come on! We got to find something to block it. Something to seal it. Come on, let's go. - Dad, please. - Dad! We have to go! It's okay. You go. Go. Get away! Get off! No! No! Oh, God. Josh. Josh. This ends with me. Paint? Paint. Dalton. You need to get rid of that thing. Burn it, forget about it. No, no, forgetting it doesn't work. We need to remember. Even the things that hurt. Dad? Okay. Okay. Okay. Is Dalton okay? -He's okay. -Okay. That's him. Dalton. Is Dad back? Yes. Yes, he's back. He's okay. See you next Friday. Tell Foster to pack his history homework. I'll help him with it. Could come a little earlier if you want. Join us for dinner. Yeah, I'd like that. Thanks. Lovely home. Oh, thanks. -Do you live here? -I hope so. That's a weird answer. Guess I'm just lost in memories. They can flood the mind. I know you. May have seen me around. I know your mother. There's so much I want to tell her. I know. And you can. And you will. Someday. You have a bright future ahead. You and Dalton. Keep a steady stride, Josh. Wow. I made the wall. Yeah. I love you, son.
