- Sinner, sinner, sinner, sinner! - I said turn that thing off and find him! Whoa whoa whoa! Oh there he is, there he is! - Are you rolling? Okay, let's get the coach, come on. - Okay, grab him, grab him! Get his legs, get his legs! - Excuse me, can you give me some comment on what happened tonight? - Oh, grab his hands! - Western Indiana university's homecoming game. It's been a stellar season for the timberwolves' quarterback, virtually certain to win the heisman trophy this year, but all those dreams came crashing down amid scandal- ... ous rumors of sexual deviation at this highly religious university. - As we reflect on last night's events, it is important to remember that for every one verse about god's grace and love and mercy, compassion, there are also two verses about god's vengeance and his wrath and his hatred of sinners. Smear the queer! - And that may remind you of an amazing gift, a gift that he has given us. Do you know it? I would hope so. - Amen. - It's his written word, the Bible, our playbook for life's challenges, and like god, who was this-- - stop. - This great architect, we must follow the examples of the Bible to expose sin and sinners for what they are. - Look, there she is. - We want to warn the nation, let them know that-- - she's so weird. - God is not going to let this country get by, and for that, we praise god. - Nice backpack. Did your moms get that for you, Curtis? - Curtis? More like turd-is! - Turd-is? Oh my god, that's awesome. Emily turd-is. That's what we're gonna call you from now on. - Can I please pass? - "Can I please pass?" - Paula, Annabelle, report to homeroom immediately. - Yes, Mr. Thompson! - Thank you. - Turd-is. Teacher's pet. 15 seconds left. Third down, ball on the pirates' 30 yard line. - Klein hoping to get some protection from an offensive line that's been beaten consistently all evening. Klein drops back. Levy is open. Oh ho ho! - Too much air under that one. All right, fourth down. - Timberwolves down to their last chance. Nine seconds remain. - Klein facing very first loss ever in an illustrious college career. - Jude Jude Jude Jude Jude Jude! - All right, klein, trust your instincts. Have faith. You see an opportunity you take it, all right? - Ready, break! - The game's in your hands. - All right, the coach giving klein some words of encouragement there. A lot's riding on this. - So it all comes down to this play. Such a nail biter. There's someone in motion there. - Jude Jude Jude Jude Jude Jude Jude Jude Jude! Receiver in motion. Now, two receivers on each side. The crowd is on their feet! - Now this is what it's all about. - All right, come on! - Come on, you jealous? - Aw, shut up. - Klein surveying the field, checking down. Now the receiver in motion. Klein is dropping back! The pirates are flipping! - Run it! - Klein throws the ball down and starts to run! 35, 30. Sidestep to tackle! 25! 20! - Go! Come on! Go go go go go! Get the block, 15! Klein's going for it! Look at that! - Pass to the five! Touchdown! Oh my god! I don't believe what I just saw. Jude klein just pulled a proverbial victory from a sure defeat. - What a general on that field! Wolves 20, pirates 19. Her streak continues! I would say this crowd's got everything and more tonight. - That's my girlfriend! - Saint Jude does her victory dance to the delight of her fans. - Well, let's just hope the men's team now can catch some of Jude's fire. Yesterday's loss puts them at oh and four, thanks to bill "butterfingers" Bradley's three fumbles. - Feel the love on that field tonight! The mvp is not stopping tonight, no way. Jude! That's the pros calling you, girl! - Do you have anything else to confess in god's name? - No, but there's something else I want to talk about if that's okay. - Proceed, my child. - I feel like I only live for my fans, like everybody only knows Jude klein, the football player, not Jude klein, the real person. It just feels like nobody knows who I am. You know what I mean? - Kelly! - Hi, how are you? - Like I'm going through the motions. Not really connected to it. - I really like your dress. - But you have to trust in god's path for you, and accept his journey for you that's tailor-made. Bless you, Jude. You're gonna do god's work. - Hey, good game. - Oh, thank you. - Chug, chug, chug! - Mouth to spout, right boys? - Mouth to spout, mouth to spout. - That's mouth to spout. - He got it. - On your knees, pledge. You ready? - Go easy on him, okay? - Yeah. - We got you, brother. - Come on, let's go. - Chug, chug, chug! - I said easy, bill. Man, slow down. - Who cares? - Come on, he's just a pledge. Come on fatty, let's go. - Dude, sorry. Hey, come on. I got it. Go, go. Come on. - Jude, Jude, come here. - Hey, look, I know he can be a bit of a dick, but in my mind, you're already an official otp, all right? - Whatever. - I got you. - Okay. - Okay, we'll we're gonna mingle. It was really good to see you. - Okay, have fun. Hey, great game today, Jude. - Oh, thank you. - Do you think next time, maybe you could just pretend to be interested? Those kind of girls really make or break me for homecoming queen. - Okay. - Thank you. - Why don't you take a lap, and I'm gonna go find the bathroom. - Okay, well come back quick. It's a little easier to mingle when you have the star quarterback on your arm. Okay, be quick. Ugh, you taste like chips. - Oh, this is great. You in line? - Yeah. I'm the last man. - That's a long line. - Yeah. There's another bathroom on the other side of the house. - I don't want to face the crowd again. It never ends. - Jude klein? - Mm. - Can I get a picture? Can you take our picture? - Oh, yeah. - Of course, of course. - Smile. Okay. - Thanks so much. - Yeah. - Call me. - Oh my god, so embarrassing. - Hey, you're a popular girl. - Would've been a different story if I lost the game. - Yeah, but you actually haven't lost a game since your freshman year at victory high, where you started all four seasons, and then you were recruited by all of the big conference schools, and now, here you are, star quarterback of the western indy timberwolves, and now you're gonna lead them to their potentially first undefeated season ever. - I'm sorry, who are you? - I'm Ryan Morris. Sports journalism. I'm actually doing a cover story on you for the observer. - Oh really, a cover story, huh? - Mm-hmm. - Hey, pledge. You in line? - Yes. But you can take my spot, brother. - Hey, we're not your brothers, pledge. We're your betters. - Right. Sorry if I offended you. - Sorry to interrupt, you guys, but I've been trying to get in touch with... - Ryan. - Ryan all week about the story for the paper that he's doing. - Oh, sorry, Jude. I didn't recognize you out of uniform. Awesome game today. - Oh, thanks bill. Hey I saw your playback of the game. You got totally screwed, dude. They should've thrown a flag on that play. - Yeah, well, once the media labels you butterfingers you can't really come back from that, so. But thanks anyway. - Mm-hmm. See you later, boys. - Thank you so much. There's nothing like drunk frat boys. - That's because you haven't been around drunk sorority girls. - Mm. - Excuse me. - Hey, I'll let you go ahead of me. Only if you let me interview you. - Okay. Tomorrow after practice? - Okay. - Cool. - Hi. Konnichiwa, hey hey, jambo.. Welcome to the neighborhood. We brought muffins. - Thank you. - I'm Karen Curtis. This is my daughter, Emily. - Hi. - Hi. - It's a bad time? We can come back. - Oh, no. I'm sorry. Please come in. I'm Susan. - Hi. For you. - Oh, thank you. - Hope you like bran. - Mm. Please excuse the mess. We're still settling in. - Oh, no, don't worry. Moving in is such a nightmare, especially with children. Do you have kids? - Not yet, but we're talking about it. - Nice. Which one of you is gonna carry? - Oh, definitely me. - Me too. I loved it. We both did, actually. Having a kid is a wonderful experience. - Mom, look at how pretty this picture is. - Oh. - Honey? You seen my keys? The nurse just called. She's awake, so I need to get over there. - I think we caught you at a bad time. - Honey, look what the neighbors brought us. Muffins. - Well, that's very neighborly. - Well, I'll let you finish what you're doing. - Sorry, I'm on call this weekend, so-- - but maybe next week we can have dinner? - Yeah, sure. I do have to check with my wife. We have very busy schedules. But I will get back to you. Come on, Emily. - Nice meeting you. - It was really nice to meet you too, Emily. - Take care. - When are we gonna have dinner with them? - Sweetie, I'm sorry, that's not gonna happen. - Why not? - Well, it just can't. - But you said you wanted to make them feel welcome. - I did, but that was before. - Before what? - Before i knew they were 'ros. - What's a 'ro? - Heterosexual. - What's a heterosexual? - Something you're too young to know about. I'm okay with it, but your mother would never associate with them. Come on. - I know, but why? - Why is there sky? - I don't know, because god made one? - Good answer. - God blesses you on this day, and forgives all those that ask his forgiveness. Proceed, my child. - Since our last conversation, I just, I decided to let go of expectation and be a little bit more like I am on the field, present, you know what I mean? I feel like my life is, it's like a big practice session, like I keep waiting for the big game, and the game never comes. - Give yourself to the fervor of his word, and comfort yourself in your faith. - Okay. You're on the field. And your focus is on the ball. Your adrenaline surges as the ball snaps. - All right, all right, I'm seeing a lot of heart out there. I like heart. Hit the showers. Get some rest, ladies. That's it. - Your hands sting from the impact of the ball. There's just nothing else that makes me feel more alive. You scan the field for a receiver. Your heart starts pounding, because you can feel the defense closing in on you. It takes me beyond anything in my real life. I wish life was like that. Did you get all that? - Yeah, it's great. I feel like I'm right there with you. ♪ Here with me - and Jude, god bless you. Good game on Saturday. You keep those wins coming. - Thanks for meeting me. - Yeah, anything for the fans. I should go. - Yeah, of course. - See ya. - See ya. - Woo! All right, well, Curtis. Curtis? You have to actually throw the ball. - I tried, coach. - Well, try harder, i don't know, or maybe try drama club, I don't know. - My moms want me to play football. - Well, football is not for everyone. Hey, santilli? Help Curtis out of her gear. - Yes, coach! - All right, show's over! Let's go! I want to see you on the run! - Come on, Emily. - I wanna see some jumps and I wanna see them now! - Let me take your helmet. Turn around towards the bleachers so they don't see you cry. She can be really mean sometimes. At least she didn't yell at you in front of everybody. That's the worst. - Did she do that to you? - Yeah. Told me I was so uncoordinated even Jesus wouldn't want to play with me. - Faster! You call that running?! - So how'd you end up being the equipment manager? - My dads begged the coach not to cut me from the team, so she made me the towel boy of the girls' team. - Sorry. - It's okay. I don't listen to her when she's really mean like that. Neither should you. - I know it's kinda dorky, but sometimes I wish the school had a croquet team. I'm good at that. - No way? Me too. - Really? You want to come over and play it sometime? - Sure. - Maybe like Saturday? Hey, four eyes! Quit your gum flapping! Get me some water! - Coming, coach. See you Saturday. - See ya. - No! What is this? Not the bucket! A cup! - Okay. ♪ He woke me up this morning - look at that. - Keep the kid still, please. - It's perfect. This is exactly the kind of inspiration that our congregation needs. I love it. Reverend Rachel. Hey, bill, how are you? What can I do for you? - Hold the baby still please. - Really? Okay, well, have you been praying about it? Well, you're doing god's work. You let the lord be with you and all your questions are gonna be answered. Talk to you soon. Bye. Look what I have! Let me see that shot. - Aunt Rachel? - That is so good. That is so good. Yes, honey? - CBS news wants to do an exclusive on today. - Oh, I think we've done enough for today, hon. Reverend Rachel? - With all the admired beauties of verona go thither. Thither? Thither. That makes sense. - Hey, babe. What's for dinner? How about pizza? - Oh, check the menu drawer. What else we got? Remember when we used to cook for each other? I miss that. Well, we got Chinese, thai, Japanese. You feeling any of these? Dave? David? Dave? - Huh? Sorry. - What's going on? - I am just rewriting Shakespeare's Romeo and Julio. - Why? - Well, I thought we should do it as will originally intended. - Which would be? - Romeo and Juliet. - Oh, all right. - That should get people talking, right? - Babe, you know I love you and I support all of your causes, but-- - but what? - This is a hot topic right now. - Yeah. - And this will most definitely put you on the good reverend Rachel's radar, believe that. - Who cares? I don't care. Bring it on, please. What's her problem anyway? Why is she so fixated on the hetero issue? - You don't know? - If I knew, i wouldn't have asked. What? - I go, okay. - What? - Her sister left her wife for the church handyman. Left the entire family. - You're kidding me? - Now, they don't tell people, but a few of us are in the know. They keep it quiet. - The reverend's sister is hetero. Maybe she's worried it runs in the family. - Right? So you be careful, my little rebel with a cause, all right? - Mm-hmm. - Now, dinner. - Mm, what about pizza? "With all the admired beauties of verona go thither "and with unattainted eye, "compare her face with some that I shall show." - Get it. - "And I will make thee think thy swan a grow." - We support people so they feel like they are not alone. Hi, really nice to meet you. - You're disgusting. - Gross. - Oh, hey guys. Kel wanted me to tell you to vote for her. Don't forget. You don't have to. - She got my vote. - Yeah, mine too, but only because she's your girl, klein. - Yeah, yeah. All right, I'll see you guys. - Bye. - Bye. - We gotta get to class. - Excuse me? Hi. Sorry, I didn't mean to eavesdrop, but I heard you saying that your girlfriend's running for homecoming queen. - Oh yeah, Kelly Williams. - Yeah, I've seen her posters around. So you must be Jude klein? - That's me. - Jude klein. I'm Susan Miller. I'm director of the hac. - Oh. Well, it was really nice to meet you, but I should get going. - Oh, hey, listen, do you know Collin Reese? - Yeah, he's the best quarterback of the men's league. - Well, he just became a member of the alliance, and he's a good friend of mine. - Wow, he supports hetero rights? - Yeah, he better. He just came out. - They're still letting him play? - The world is changing, Jude, slowly, but, but it's changing. - Hey, Jude. - If you could join the alliance, or someone like you, it would mean so much-- - no. I'm not gay. - Oh, you know, you don't have to be hetero to be in the alliance. It's just to support-- - sorry, sorry. - Jude! I'm so sorry. You okay? - Thanks. It's probably just a sprain. - Is there anything i can get you? - No, thank you. I'll just walk it off. - Are you sure? I didn't break the star quarterback? - No, that's fine. - Well, maybe you should just walk her to the dorm, just to be safe. - Yeah. - Well, okay. - Do you need help or something? - Hi, did you get a button? Here you go, vote for Kelly. Thank you. Vote Kelly. Did you get a button? - What's with the jugs? - Some pledge thing, I don't know. It's supposed to build stamina? - Stupid. - Thank you, thank you, ego boost. So, what were you doing at that booth? - It was some heterosexual rights club or something like that. - Oh. I started a club like that in high school. - Really? - Yeah. - Wow. Well, that was very progressive of you. - My moms didn't think so. They freaked out, actually. They're really religious, so. - You're not? - No. - But you go to a religious university? - Well, it was the only scholarship I got, so here I am. - This one's broken. - Okay, well how am I supposed to give-- - vote Kelly! Here, take a button. Thanks for coming. How am I supposed to give these out if they're broken, Kim? - Oh, they must be really proud of you. - I don't talk to them much. - Jude, hey! - Hey. - Hey. - What's going on, man? - How's my golden girl? What's going on with your leg? - Oh, nothing, I tripped. I sprained it. - You okay? - So pink, hot pink, or-- - hot pink, light pink, whatever, just make sure they're pink. - Yes, I'm good. - Should I call coach? - No, no. - You sure? - Yes, I'm good. - Okay. Come here. Hey, promise me you'll see the trainer in the morning? - You got it. - Love you. - Love you. - He's a big guy. - Yeah, he is. He's actually my offensive coordinator. Calls all the plays. He's awesome. He's got my back. Hey, I could set you up with him. - Oh, no. That's okay. He's not really my type. - Oh, okay. - Make sure you vote. - Okay. - Vote's coming up really soon. Thank you, I'll text you later. - All right. - I'll see ya. - All right. Bye. - There's Jude. - Hey, that's Jude. - Jude! Hi. - Hi, babe. What are you doing here? - Was just coming to say hi. I had texted you, but i didn't hear back. - I tripped and sprained my ankle. - Shoot, are you okay? - Yeah. I just have to ice. - Oh, I'm sorry. - Hi. - Hi. So, the kas are having a fundraiser after the game on Saturday, and I said that you would stay and sign autographs. I think it would really help my vote. - Okay. - Hey, do you think if I win the crown your friend Ryan would do a story on me? - I'll ask him. - Are you gonna be able to play on Saturday? - Yes, of course. - Aw, come on, not again. - I can't help it. Told ya I was the champion. - Shh, I'm concentrating. - Don't mess up! - Agh! I'm gonna get you for that! - No! - Come here, come here! - No! - Better run! - No! No, no, no! - I gotta get home. Rematch? - You bet! - Bye, Emily! - Bye, Ian! - Who's hungry? - How was youth group today? - Fine. - Just fine? - Yeah, it was fine. - Here we go. - What do you want me to say? - I want you to talk to me, Paula, and lose the attitude. - Here we go. - Yes! - Look at those guys, huh? - I'm home. - Hey, just in time. - Tacos. - All right. Hey, sweetheart, would you say grace for us? - Yeah. - Thanks. - Dear lord, we thank you for this bounty you have provided for us. - Ow! - Please bless the hands that prepared this food. In your name we're praying. Amen. - Amen. - Amen. - Amen. - All righty. One, yes sir. All right. - So how was your play date? - It was fun. We played croquet. - Nice. Who won? - Emily did. - Emily turd-is? - It's Curtis. - She's a weirdo. - No, she's not. - She's a total freak. - Hey, hey, Paula. We don't call people names in this house, all right? - Well, she is. You shouldn't be friends with her. - It is perfectly okay for boys to be friends with girls. - Yeah. - No, it's not. Reverend Rachel says it's a sin. - That's not what she meant. - Then what does she mean, dad? - You know how during the breeding, the periods, breeding periods when a couple agrees on having a child, they, well, in order to have the kid they go through-- - they're talking about boys who do it with girls. - A woman and a man. - Ew, gross. - Yeah, well, you know what? That's the right idea, son. We don't wanna see you end up like those kids from the university-- - Peter. - What kids? - Never mind. That's enough chatter. - Oh, you know what? I totally forgot the cilantro. - Pass me the remote please. The game's on. - Be right back. - The reporter's got game. - Look who it is, the star quarterback. What are you doing here? - Oh my gosh. - Wow. Hey, I didn't know you play. - Think fast. - Oh, so she plays football and basketball. - That's right. Wanna play? - Nah, I don't think so. - Come on. - You're too good. - Oh, but-- - psych! - Give up! - It's gonna be like that? - Yeah, it is. - Let's go. - All right, ready? - Come on. - You gonna go for it or what? Go for it. - Oh! What? - I don't know. - Two out of two? Rematch? - Maybe. - Let's go. - Hell yeah. - Hey, Jude. - Good game, man. Seriously, good game. What's up, guys? - Yeah, you too. - Jude. - How you doing? - Doing good. - Good, see ya. - Good. - Look who it is. - It's my favorite pledge. Looking good out there, Ryan. - Thank you. - Wanna play? - Yeah. - Sure. - Good morning, my brothers and sisters. I want to welcome you all to the house of god. And everyone is welcome, even sinners. But today let's get real. I am saddened to the core of my soul, as I believe that you are as well. - Where are you taking me? - You'll see. - Because a sinner who is not saved cannot reform, and they will sadly suffer the consequences of the wrath of god. - I love this. Where'd you find this place? - The frat guys come up here sometimes, but I've always thought it's just really pretty, so. - This is awesome. I haven't been on one of these things since I was a kid. - Cool, right? - Yeah. You know how to turn this thing on? - Maybe. I think it's just missing a couple parts, but nothing I can't fix. Hey, think fast! - We are living in a very rapidly changing time, a time that promotes things like equality. They teach our innocent children that they can love whomever they want to love, even someone of the opposite sex. Can I get an amen on that? - Amen. - These values break the moral compass that our children were born with. This is their birthright. - Amen. - And I would like to clarify something. Our god that tells us, "thou shalt not kill," is the same god that says, "mankind shall not lie with womankind." You don't get to just pick what you please. It's all or nothing with the lord. So really, if you say it's okay to be gay, you're saying it's okay to kill. Do you think god wants us to kill? Of course not. That is how I see it. And that is how it is reflected to us in the words of our holy Bible. - Amen. - And for that, we praise god. - Amen. - I'd like you all to stand and let's raise our voices in praise. You know, some years ago, they hid behind closed doors, as they should have, as they should still, but now it's okay to let them do it openly, brazenly, at their public parades, and even in our streets. Now they mock us. They live in sin, and they live very openly. They live brazenly. They live without remorse. You see this. They're out there marching for equality. Do you think that's right? I don't think so. Can you just imagine, try to put your mind, if we were living in a time when murderers demanded they be given protection and civil rights instead of punishment for their crimes. Why, you would just gasp in amazement, wouldn't you? Yet, you embrace the notion that because someone engages in sex with a person of the opposite gender that they deserve the same human rights? I don't think so. That's not god's intention. Because the truth is clear. Men and women are equal in god's eyes, but should live separately in same-sex unions, where the most sacred of brotherly and sisterly love can bloom, as is his design. They will work together in humble donation during the breeding season, so new sons and daughters can be brought forth to carry god's holy and very beautiful and blessed message. We shall not subject ourselves to the breeding tendencies of animals who show no restraint. I know that many of you are troubled by these events that we have been going through as a community, as am I. We are going to pray for these sinners, right? That's what we're gonna do, because we believe in god. - Forgive me reverend, for I have sinned. It's been two weeks since my last confession. - God blesses you on this day, and forgives those that ask his forgiveness. Proceed, my child. - I'll get you! - Stop it! - I've been having impure thoughts. I can't make the thoughts go away. I don't know if I want to. - Giving in to your physical desires is a selfish act, and to act on that lust is sinful. - Yes, reverend. - Does anyone know what this word means, hetero? Yes, Jodie? - Hetero is short for heterosexual. Means when a person is attracted to people of the opposite sex. - Yes. Does anyone in this class know any heterosexuals? No? Well, what if I told you there is one right here in this classroom? Right here with us today, and here he is. Would you believe the world's most famous playwright, William Shakespeare, was actually a heterosexual? And he wrote his most famous play, Romeo and Julio, for his secret lover, the duchess of southampton. This is a copy of Romeo and Juliet. - Yes? - What does that mean, Mr. Thompson? - Well, that means Julio will be played by a girl. I know, I know, it's a big change, but it is our job as artists to not only entertain, but to also enlighten. Now I hope the girls here will jump at the opportunity to play one of the juiciest roles ever written-- - oh my god, that's so exciting! - Okay, now, auditions are next week. Everyone must prepare something. - I'm so excited, aren't you? - I guess so. - You'd make a great Romeo. - You think so? - Yeah, and maybe if I got Juliet, we could practice our lines together? - That'd be really cool. - Seriously? Ew. Romeo and Juliet? That's so queer. What are you Emily, some kind of 'ro? - What, no. - Why don't you go ahead and kiss him, Emily? - Stop. - Kiss him, kiss him! - 'Ro, 'ro! - 'Ro, 'ro, 'ro, 'ro, 'ro, 'ro, 'ro, 'ro, 'ro, 'ro, 'ro, 'ro, 'ro, 'ro, 'ro, 'ro, 'ro, 'ro, 'ro, 'ro, 'ro, 'ro, 'ro, 'ro, 'ro, 'ro, 'ro, 'ro, 'ro, 'ro, 'ro, 'ro, 'ro, 'ro! - Hey, hey, hey, what's going on here? What's happening here, Emily? I'm talking to you. Who started this? - Nobody. - Nobody? And you, what about you? Where are you supposed to be? - Language. - Then get to it. Let's go. How about you, where are you supposed to be? - Math. - Well, get there. Come on. - 'Ro, 'ro, 'ro, 'ro, 'ro, 'ro, 'ro, 'ro, 'ro, 'ro, 'ro, 'ro! - Jeez. Oh, you scared me. What's going on? - What's going on? What's going on? I feel like I should be the one asking you that. - I'm not a mind reader, kel, come on. - You said you couldn't hang out tonight because you had to study. - Okay, what is this really about? - I don't know. I just, I miss you, you know? I feel like I never get to see you anymore. - You're always doing your sorority girl thing, and homecoming campaign. I'm sorry if I make you feel neglected. I'm really not trying to. - No, no. You don't make me feel neglected. - Okay, good. - I just feel like... I don't know. I miss you. - Go ahead, answer it, okay? I know that you want to. - Stop it. - It's fine. - Come here. - Ugh! - Get up here. Hey. - Hi. - This is more important. - Oh, really? - Mm-hmm. - Prove it. - I love you so much. I promise I will not stress you out so much with my craziness. - Me too. - Okay. - Okay. - Good. - Oh, shoot, that's me. Oh, I'm late for my ka meeting. I gotta go, okay? But I'll see you later, okay? - Okay. - Okay, good. Bye. - What? - You trust me, right? Stand right here. - Where are we? - Keep your eyes closed. - Okay, they're closed. - I'm watching you. - Oh my god. Are you serious? - I'm pretty serious. - Oh my goodness. How did you do this? - I told you, i can fix anything. - I like you. - What? What was that? - I like you. Oh my god, I'm on a carousel! - You are something else. - Do you think so? - Oh yeah. Well, my queen, your chariot awaits. Join me here, please. - You're too much. - Whoa, don't fall. - You good? - So good. - I'm glad. - What are we doing? - Falling in love. - Jude? - Hi. - Hey. It's nice to see you. Come on in. - Hey, I was just curious. What's the deal with the alliance? - Oh. - I actually just came by to say hi, but I don't have much time, so. - Well, we're a national organization with over 200 memberships in universities, high schools and junior highs, and our goal is to encourage acceptance and-- - did you say junior highs? - Yeah. Kids that age, unfortunately, are really vulnerable to bullying and peer pressure, and we think that an open dialogue can save lives. - What do you mean save lives? - Heterosexuality is the leading cause of teen suicide, and these kids need to know that they're not alone, that there's a place for them to come and talk, or anybody to come and talk. Is there something you want to talk about? - No. - This place is safe and confidential. - You know that guy that I bumped into when I first met you? - Oh, yeah. Ryan, right? - Mm-hmm. I don't know, at first, I just thought it was cool to talk to him and stuff, and then we were playing basketball and something happened and it was like I woke up, and I don't know, it just, I wanted to push it away. I don't know, when we touched again, it was like this feeling came over me that I did not want to stop. I know that this is wrong, but I don't know, it just feels so right. Know what I mean? - Absolutely. Some people are born attracted to the same sex. Some people are born attracted to the opposite sex. I prefer to think of it as giving love and being loved in return, and the rest is just plumbing. Does he feel the same way about you? - Oh yeah. - Oh yeah? That makes things a lot easier. - Yeah. We've only kissed, but it was like the best kiss. Oh my god, I can't stop thinking about him. - That's wonderful, and it's not gonna be an easy path. You're gonna have to tell your friends and your family. - Wait, wait, no. I can't, I can't tell anybody. No, okay? I play football. And I'm not a poster child for hetero rights. - Well, you're falling for him, aren't you? - Yeah, well, football, i love football way more, so. I gotta go, sorry. - You can have both. - "But soft, what light through yonder window breaks? "It is the east, and Juliet is the sun. "Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon." - What the hell do you think you're doing? - What? Hey! - Are you trying out for that stupid gay play? Hmm? Huh? You're not doing that play. And you're never talking to that ugly 'ro Emily turd-is ever again. - You can't tell me what to do! - Yes I can! Bad enough you're a geek face. But if you turn out to be a 'ro on top of that, I'll make you wish you were never born. - Loser. - "Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo? "Deny thy father and refuse thy name. "Or if that--" "wherefore art thou Romeo? "Deny thy father and refuse thy name. "Or if that--" "or if that will not be but sworn, my love, "i will no longer be "a capulet." Leave me alone. - Good night, girls. Don't forget to vote. - Hello? Hello? - Might need these. - How'd you get those? - I have my ways. After you. - It's so quiet. The water's perfect. - Oh yeah. Wanna race? - No. I'm scared. - Me too. - Do you really love me? - Absolutely. With all my heart. - Hey, Jude. You mind if I take a seat with you? I like it when it's quiet here too. - Yeah. - How you doing, Jude? You seem happy. Things are going well for you. - Yeah, yeah. The team's on a roll, and the scouts are out. Everything's great. - Now how about you and Kelly, how are you doing? - Can I be honest with you, reverend? I think that I'm in love with the person that god wants me to be with, and our love, it's so easy. It's like we just fit together. You know what I mean? - You're not talking about Kelly. Right? That's not right, Jude. - I know, I tried, i-- - listen to me, Jude. You cannot lead a person on like that. You need to go and let her know, and then you bring your new girlfriend here. Together we're going to pray together for forgiveness because deceit is a sin. Let's pray on that together a minute. Our father, who are in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who... - Five, four, three, two, one! - Time! Come on out, boys. - Oh! - Welcome back. Welcome back! Yes! All right! Who is next? Let's see. You, Walter. - All right. - Oh! - You're up. Big Walt! - Oh! - Lucky boy! Gets to spend seven minutes with Ryan. All right, it's your choice, seven minutes in heaven or seven minutes in hell. - You know he wants you to choose hell. - Get off of me! - Hey, hey, hey. Ryan? It's just a game. - I guess it's time for hell then. - No, just back off, all right? - Hey, why you acting like such a candy-ass 'ro, huh? Oh, wait. Unless you are a 'ro. - Oh! - I'm not a 'ro. - 'Ro, 'ro, 'ro, 'ro, 'ro, 'ro, 'ro, 'ro, 'ro, 'ro! - Hey! Then prove it. - I don't have to prove anything. - Yes, you do. - Oh, come on, look, Walter's got this gorgeous fat face waiting for you. Oh, the cushion for the pushing. - He's just a fat little piggy. He's just a fat little piggy. Oink for us, boy. Hey, I said oink! - Oink. Oink. - Jesus, he smells like one, too. - Come on. - Ryan-- - move. - Hey! Hey, you walk outta here, and you can kiss this fraternity goodbye. - Fine with me. - Ryan. Don't do this, okay? - Are you coming? - I can't. I need this. - You do not need this. You are being degraded. - This is all I got. - Come on, Ryan. Stop, man. - Let him go, let him go. Good choice, Walter. Walter, Walter, Walter, step right up, step right up. 50 bucks to whoever is man enough to go into the closet with the piggy. How about you? - Who wants cornbread? Who wants some cornbread? I bet you do. Did you wash your hands? - I don't know. - Good answer? Emily, did you tell your mom you're trying out for the school play? - The school play? What happened to the football team? - I got cut. - After I paid for all that coaching? - I'm sorry, mom. I'm not that coordinated. - So, what's the play? - Romeo and Juliet. I'm trying out for Juliet. - Well, that's wonderful, isn't it? - That's terrific. - Mr. Thompson rewrote it for girls. Did you know that Shakespeare wrote it for his secret lover, the duchess of southampton? - Wait. Wait, what role did you say you were trying out for? - Juliet. - And who's playing Romeo? - Hopefully Ian santilli. - But he's a boy, honey. I thought you said it was being rewritten for girls. - Only Julio's part. Mr. Thompson says we're gonna enlighten the school about tolerance. - Did you know about this? - Well, I did sign a consent for her rehearsals, but-- - bad enough these heteros are moving into our neighborhood. Now they want their perverted lifestyles taught in our schools? No, no way. You're not doing the play. You are not doing this kind of crap. Gimme that. I'm not having this. No ma'am. This is garbage. Hetero crap. Who does this Mr. Thompson think he is, putting our kids in these adult situations? If he's not careful, he's gonna end up with another situation just like the one at the university. What's the name of the principal? - Henry birdsell, but I'm gonna call him tomorrow. - Yes, can I get a number for a Henry birdsell please? - Honey, i will call him tomorrow. Go wash your hands. - Thank you. You know I'm right about this. I don't like the look of her results. No. - Thanks. Jude. Hey, come here. - Hey. - Hey. - Hey, sorry I'm late. I was talking to reverend Rachel. - That's okay. I'm used to being last on your list. - Kelly, stop it. - No, no, it's fine, that's okay. I know you have a lot going on. Here, take a button. - Can we talk? - Did you know that your friend Ryan was kicked out of his fraternity? - What? Why? - Yeah. Here you go, thanks. They think he's a closet hetero. - Really? - Isn't that funny? - Wow. - Here you go. Vote for Kelly. - That's really surprising. - Did he ever try anything with you? - No. No, that's disgusting. - Right, okay. Here, take a sucker. Vote Kelly. - Hey, Kelly, I need to be honest with you. Kel, Kelly, reverend Rachel thinks that we should end this. - So you told her what's going on? - Yeah. - And her answer was for you to break up with me? - Yeah. - And you chose to do it here, in public? - Yeah. I'm sorry. I don't know how to do this. I don't know. I just know that it's not right for me to lead you on. - The vote is tomorrow, and we need to keep this between us until then, okay? Because I need to figure out how to go public with it. - Go public with it? What are you talking-- - yes, Jude, we are a celebrity couple on campus and things need to be handled a certain way. Here, take a button, thanks. - Kelly. I'm sorry I... - You owe me this. Okay? Here you go. Vote for Kelly. Do you want a picture with Jude klein? Smile. I need votes. Here, put this on. - I tried to cleanse that sinner, I really did, but it didn't help. I still felt the same way inside. So I asked the lord for a sign. - And when you prayed about this, what did the lord say? - Revelations 16. And then I knew it was done. Thank you, god. He said that if I cleansed sin wherever I found it, then I'd also cleanse myself. - God came down with his divine spirit. And you know what he did? We got a second chance. - Amen. - Amen. He stopped the defilement of our humble community. And we should thank god for that. - If I'm doing god's work, then why do I feel like such a sinner? - These boys believed that what they were doing was acting on behalf of the holy spirit to save us. So who are we to judge them? - God bless all sinners. - God bless all sinners. And may they walk on the path of the lord and do your work. - May they walk on the path of the lord and do his work. - We are going to pray for these sinners. Each of us is gonna continue to spread the holy word, because these messages were sent by god. Ah, reverend Duncan. - And in doing so, this is going to save all of us. - I'm detective Michaels. - Yes? - My partner, detective Emerson. We'd like to ask you a few questions about your involvement in the persecution and attempted murder of a young heterosexual. - Stay away from my brother, turd-is, you weirdo! What is wrong with you, anyway? You're a sinner. You need to cleanse! What's wrong with you? Stay down! - Help! - What's wrong with you? Stay down! - Stop, stop! - Take a drink, cleanse yourself! Stay down! Come on, let's go! - What is happening? - Freak! Come on, let's go, come on. - Hey! - Jesus. Sweetheart, stand up. You okay? Why don't you dry yourself? I'll make sure those girls get punished severely for this. Look, I know this is a tough time for you, but I promise you, you're gonna get through this. You hear me? Emily, you know the only reason those girls do this is because they're jealous of you, right? - Jealous of me? - That's right, because you know who you are. Most people don't start figuring that out until they're old like me. Now, let's get you another script, because I expect to see you at that audition, you understand me? - Yes, sir. - I pray to god for forgiveness. I pray to god for these sinners. - Hey. Take a look at that. So, one of the boys involved in the incident claims to have had a phone conversation with you where you ordered them to do the victim harm. Do you know anything about that? - I'm a woman of faith. I don't believe in giving orders. - All right. I'll rephrase. Where you advised them to do god's work. How about that? - I have many parishioners. I speak to them on a daily basis. I couldn't possibly remember every conversation I've ever had. - Of course not, of course. Let me ask you a question. You ever watch YouTube? - I don't have time for that kind of thing. I'm busy doing the lord's work. - Of course you are. Well, one of the things about this generation is that they love to document every aspect of their lives on the Internet. Now, most of the time it's inane, but every now and then we find something of real interest. Emerson, lights please. - Oh, wait. I'm gonna call the reverend. She'll know what to do. - Hey. - Hey Jude, it's Susan. - What's going on? - Oh, nothing, I just talked to Collin Reese, and he's coming to the game tomorrow. - Are you serious? - Yes, and wait, it gets better. - Oh my god! Are you kidding me? That's the greatest news! Greatest day ever! - He wants to know if you're available for dinner tomorrow night after the game. - Oh I do, I do. - Jude? - Oh my god, oh my god. - Jude? Hello? Hello, hello, hello? Jude? - Oh my god oh my god! Hey guys. What's going on? Kelly! - I told you we were going public. - How could you do this to me? - I didn't do this! You did it! And this, and this! - Kelly, Kelly, please stop! - And this and this and this! - Stop it, stop it! - Why? - Listen to me, stop, stop. - Why? What, so you can lie to my face again? - Please, please, stop-- - don't touch me! Stop! Tell your little boyfriend that everybody knows. Oh, and have a good game tomorrow. - Susan? Are you still there? Hello? - This is Ryan, leave a message. - Ryan, please pick up. Ryan, Kelly knows. Ryan, everybody knows everything. Kelly knows. She put pictures of us everywhere. If you love me, Ryan, you've got to go somewhere safe, okay? Just please go somewhere safe. I love you. - Yes Mrs. fallon, how are you? And we've been, and we feel the same way, yes we do. I understand, I understand. I appreciate the call. Yes, we're on top of it, I promise you. Have a good day. Dave? - Yes. - David, how long have you been teaching drama for us? - I believe five years. This is the sixth year. - And how many times have you ever changed a piece of literature to use as a teaching opportunity? - Well, Henry, I would say that I see every piece of literature as a teaching-- - no, come on, you know what I mean. - How many times have i actually changed the text? No, this is the first. - Why? Why would you do that now? Hmm? Especially with this topic, in particular? - Well, first of all because it's a really cool idea. Artistically it has merit. But more importantly, because what happened to Ryan Morris was horrendous. - It was horrendous, exactly, which is why we shouldn't be reminding the children about it. - Children aren't born with that kind of hatred, Henry. They learn it. And it's our job as educators to make sure-- - Nate, hold my calls please. - I believe it is our job as educators to make sure these kids see the world in the right way, not just intellectually, but morally. - That's where i disagree with you. Moral issues are to be handled at home. - This is happening on our time, in our space. What are we supposed to do? - It's not our job. - Are we supposed to... This is happening under our roof. - Moral issues are to be handled by the parents. It's their responsibility, not ours. - So what are we supposed to do? We're supposed to just stand back and watch-- - there's always going to be bullying, David. - I don't think anyone deserves to be beaten or bullied or talked down to because of-- - why are you being so pro-heterosexual? - Well, I'm not being. - David, my phone has been ringing off the hook all morning. - I predicted that. I probably should have talked to you first. I apologize. - These parents want blood. - Okay. - They want blood, David. - Well. - And, sorry to say-- - it's not that big of deal, okay? - You can resign today for personal reasons or-- - what? Come on. - Or, or-- - Henry, stop it. - Or the superintendent said we can fire you-- - the superintendent? - Reverend Rachel made it very clear that if you weren't gone by lunchtime today, there would be hell to pay for him come election time. - She's a reverend. She can't do that. - Mm-hmm, yeah, she can, and she will. So, David, it's killing me, it breaks my heart. What's it gonna be? Resignation or termination? - I'm hungry. What's for lunch? - These are from yesterday's jubilee. - Waste not, want not, dear. - Holy shit! - Benson, how many times have I told you to watch your garbage mouth in my house? - I'm sorry, aunt Rachel, but you gotta hear this. Star quarterback outed. - Who? - Jude klein. - Jude klein? - It says that her girlfriend Kelly Williams outed her yesterday after she caught her in the act with some guy named Ryan Morris. - That little bitch. - Oh, listen to this, listen to this. When asked why she posted her pictures all over campus, Williams replied, "according to my mentor, reverend Rachel, "it is my religious duty to expose sin "wherever I can find it." Head coach Glen Thompson said that she's still gonna go pro, that they have scouts from the packers, the steelers and the patriots all confirmed for tonight's game. - Oh, that's not gonna happen. I told her it was okay. I told her that god was gonna pick out someone just for her. - What are you talking about? - You know, I might have been fooled, but the good lord is not fooled. No, he is not. He sees truth where truth exists and he acts accordingly. - That's the truth. - Praise god, help me. It's time to do god's work. Benson, I need to focus on family values at the photo shoot. You're gonna go to that football game, and you're gonna do god's work. - Wait, wait, just me? I'm not ready for that. - Was Noah ready for that? Was Moses ready? No, they were not ready, but they did as god commanded them to do. Now, are you gonna disappoint god today, or are you gonna go do his work? - I'll go do his work. - You're gonna do his work. Come on, let's go, Ashley. Come on. - I need you to hear me, god. Ryan and I said that we decided to take some time apart just so everything can die down. I think that's the right thing to do. Just gimme a sign our love is not wrong. Please god, just gimme a sign. Just gimme a sign, gimme a sign. Gimme a sign. Gimme a sign. Thank you, god. Thank you, god. - "Poison hath been his timeless end. "Oh, churl, drunk all, "and left no friendly drop to help me after. "I will kiss thy lips." - Emily, did you hear what happened to Mr. Thompson? - What? - He quit. - What? - Or got fired. Jodie ritter was in the office, and they already had over 100 complaints about the play. - What? That's not fair. Now I'm never gonna get to kiss a boy. - Kiss a boy? What are you talking about? Are you gay? Like a hetero? - I don't know what I am. - Paula was right. - Ian, please! - I can't be friends with you anymore. - Why not? - People are gonna think I'm like you, and that's gross. - You all know me to be a man of not too many words. Why wolves? Hmm? Why do you think we chose the timberwolf to represent the spirit of this team, this school, and this community? Two words: Pack mentality. A wolf on its own, it can survive, yeah, but it's together-- - she's gonna freak out when she sees this. - That they thrive. - Hey, look, there's turd-is. - There for each other, always. And that's what we will do as a team. We will support each other on that field and off. - Well, if it isn't the little queer who wants to kiss my baby brother. - Stop it. - Now, the crusaders, they out there thinking they got our number today, we gonna be weak, caught up in petty differences, innuendo. They may attack one of their own for being different, but not us. Not the timberwolves. See, we're gonna show them we are stronger when we are challenged, and we are stronger when we are attacked. - Do you wanna play a game with us? - When one of us is attacked, hell, when we're attacked, we push back! We're gonna go out there, we're gonna run faster, we're gonna hit harder! - You guys go that way, you guys follow me, we'll cut her off at the fence. - And we're gonna bring home a victory for all of us! Who are we? - Timberwolves! - Who are we? - Timberwolves! - T wolves on three, let's go! One, two, three! - T wolves! - Break! All right, all right. - Where you going, breeder? - And here comes Jude klein! Look, look at her body language. Not at all the swagger we're accustomed to seeing from klein. Will we see the end of a win streak for Jude? - Come on, take the field, let's go! We're a pack, let's go! - Come on, let's just play some football, huh? Let's go. What are we doing? Come on, take the field! Let's pack! Shut it out, let's go ladies! - Come on, Jude, let's go. - Let's go ladies, let's go! - Here we are in the fourth quarter. - 55 seconds, on one, on one, ready, break! - No surprise, Jude has risen above-- - where do you think you're going, breeder? Crowd usually seen at the wolves' away games though. - Klein's still in command here, but down by a touchdown. The ball is snapped. - She has Levy down on the sideline. Touchdown, timberwolves! Look at that, they could tie the score now with the extra point. - Have you ever seen such desire in a player? - Don't touch me, breeder. - Faggot! - Get outta the stadium! Getting no love whatsoever from her teammates. Really sad situation. - Ro, what is wrong with you? You're sick! - Smear the queer! Smear the queer! - If you're just joining us, Jude klein has brought the timberwolves back from 21 points down to tie the game! - No doubt her personal choices have but you can't find fault. Obviously, her team has lost all respect for her, despite the performance she has shown here tonight. Oh, it's a fumble! The wolves recover, they have the ball! That's a miracle, keeping klein's streak alive. There you go. Let's kick that field goal and celebrate! - And coach Thompson not wasting any time at all getting special teams on the field. - Klein, this has been a hard game for you. I can put in the second string if you want. - No, I got this. Klein putting on her helmet. She's not leaving anything to chance. Can't blame her, really. - I haven't seen the quarterback fold since the '80s, but I'm sure Thompson wasn't about to say no-- - let's go Jude! Woo! This is the kind of move that should tell everyone what Jude is made of. - Any scouts out there taking notice? You know it, you know it! - Now it looks like the huddle is breaking up before klein can get in. - Hey you. I just wanted to let you know I was safe. From where I am right now, I have the most amazing view of you in all of your glory. I love you. I'll see you soon. - Klein kneels for the snap. - You're a queer! - You're a queer! - No, let me go! - Ow! - You little bitch! Smear the queer! - Mommy! - Smear the queer! - Freak! Smear the queer! - So for the win here, 43 off, eight seconds left in regulation. - You in? - No more timeouts left for either team. - Hey, let's push it overtime. - Smear the queer! - No! - Smear the queer! - Smear the queer! - So, we playing a little game of smear the queer? - Dumb queer! - Breeder! - Stop it, stop! - Breeder! - Stop! The ball is set after some discussion on the field. - Ten hut! Here's the snap! - Smear the queer! - No, no! Stop, stop! - Lori, gimme that. - The whole line is letting the crusaders rush in untouched! The kicker has fallen to the ground! - Do us all a favor, 'ro. And kill yourself. - Ow! Klein is getting hit by the whole crusader team. She fumbles the ball. The wolves are standing around just doing nothing. - It's completely out of hand. Her own team just called a smear play. That's a disgrace. - The referees have thrown a flag. All the players are actually celebrating. And klein is still buried under a heap, a pile of players. Some people are gonna say this is what klein had coming to her, but come on. - Oh, just a vicious attack. Coaches are running onto the field right now. - Die, breeder! Klein is not moving, and they're bringing in the stretcher as we speak. - God hates you, Curtis. - Get back! Get outta the way! You're okay, you'll be fine. - You're fine. - Just breathe. We're gonna take care of you, all right? - Sinner, sinner, sinner! Never asked forgiveness, but is subject to eternal condemnation! - What more can you do?! This is god's work? That's what you're doing? You better pray to god she's all right! - Oh there he is, there he is! - Are you ready? Are you rolling? Okay, let's get in the coach, come on, go go go go! - Grab him, grab him! Get him, get him! - Any comment on what happened here tonight? - Quiet, quiet! Listen to me! We prayed for you, Ryan, we all did, and this is what we came to, revelations, chapter 16! We are here to cleanse you. We are here to cleanse you because we are the seven angels and we are doing god's work. You get that? Good, good. Come on, get him to me! Wait, let me call the reverend. She'll know what to do. - Reverend Rachel. - Reverend Rachel! It's bill Bradley from omega theta pi. - Hey, bill, how are you? What can I do for you? - We want to save that hetero guy that was involved with the quarterback. - Really? Okay, well, have you been praying about it? - Yes, ma'am. We just need your blessing first. - Well, you're doing god's work. You let the lord be with you and all your questions are gonna be answered. - You heard it, boys. We're doing god's work! Come on, get him down! Get him! Congratulations, reverend, you're now an accessory to a hate crime. - Hello! - You can't get me! You can't get me, see, oh! - Do I hear trouble? - Mom, come quick! - No! - Oh, woman down! - Oh woman must leave and we save this dragon. - I think I need a kiss. - Oh. Let me see those. - Tell him i left him $10,000 in the cookie jar if I die. - I'm sorry, i couldn't hear that. One more time, please? - Don't forget to fix the car. - Did you know that? Hi honey! Fix the car, that's the most important part. Oh my god. - What is that? - Oh my god. Oh my god, Emily, what happened? Come here, honey. Oh my god, baby. What? - What happened? - What, come here, hon. - Stop, no! - Honey. - Who did this to you? - Who did this to you? - Nobody. - Emily! What happened to you? I'm talking to you! What happened to you? - Vicki, stop. It's gonna be okay, sweetie. - Who did this? - Lemme look at this. - Who did this?! - Nobody. - It's gonna be okay, honey. Who did this? - Emily! Who did this? Emily! - Paula santilli and Annabelle snyder. - Ian's sister? - This is your fault. - What, how is this my fault? - You took her over to the neighbors'. I know about that. - Would you... Go to your room and get cleaned up. Cooper? Cooper, earmuffs. - But I want my tanks. - Hold onto your tanks, just go. Play with them in the kitchen. This is my fault? - Yeah, this is your fault. - How is this my fault? - Yes, it's your fault, you coddle her. You act like this is normal! Have you seen what they do to these kids? - Keep your voice down, honey. - I'm not gonna keep my voice down! I don't feel like keeping my voice down! - Don't you dare tell our-- - I've had it! - Daughter that! - She is confused. - Confused? - Yes! - My ass! - She brings this on herself by acting like that with this play! This is enough of this! I'm not having a breeder growing up in my house. - Do you hear what you're saying? - Yeah, I hear what I'm saying. - No. - Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up. - I gotta go. - Oh, Susan, it's you. - Jude! Hi. - Where's Ryan? Where's Ryan? - I'm not sure. I called him a few times. - Ryan. - But I'm gonna try him again, okay? We'll find him. - Stop here, stop here! - Woo! - Fuck yeah! - Woo! - Get out of the car! - Come on! - Woo! - Get him out! Get him out! Get him out! - Oh, tonight is your night, baby! - Here we go, here we go! Oh that's right, that's right, stand him up! Stand him up! - Stand him up, baby! - Get him up. - Woo! - Stand him up! - Stand him up! Come on! Come on! Get him away! Get that hetero faggot away from me! - Woo! - You want a Ryan Morris? Is that what you want, another Ryan Morris on your hands? I wouldn't want... - Stop it. Why have we been going to church all these years? Why have we brought our children up here? So the minute something-- - I don't want to calm down! I wanna get this kid together! Have you thought about that? Have you seen what they do to these kids? - Come on! Get that hetero faggot away from me! Take him up! - Move it, move it, breeder! Get him away! - Come on! Come on, get him! Get him! Yeah! Yeah, get him! Get him! - Get him, boys! - Get him! Come on, come on, come on! Yeah, yeah, get him! Yeah! Let me see your face, huh, huh? - Okay, okay, okay! Okay, listen, he's had enough! Okay, okay, okay! I said okay!

And what is that on your cheek? - Oh, that little creep Emily turd-is kicked me. - She what? - Why would she do that? - We taught her a lesson.

All of you, go on, go ahead! Okay. Revelations, chapter 17, verse 16. The seventh angel poured out his vial into the air. And there came a great voice out of the kingdom of heaven, from the throne, saying, "it is done." - Please help me. - We are doing god's work! - Smear the queer! Smear the queer! Ugly hetero! Die breeder! Romeo and Juliet? That's so queer. What are you Emily, some kinda 'ro? - I'm not gonna have a breeder growing up in my house. - She's sick and she needs help! - 'Ro, 'ro, 'ro, 'ro, 'ro, 'ro, 'ro, 'ro, 'ro, 'ro! - I don't know, guess she didn't like playing smear the queer. - What? - What did you do to Emily? - It's disgusting, and I'm not gonna have it! - Calm down, honey. - What about Cooper? - Just please calm down. - Have you thought about that? What if he gets beat up too? - Excuse me? - Oh my god. - I only beat her up a little bit. - Wait, wait. Honey, please get the curtises on the phone. - Yep. - You can explain to all of us what you did to Emily, and you can apologize to her as well, and to her parents. - I'm trying to protect her. - I understand that. - It's Pete santilli. Curtis residence? - Yeah, completely unacceptable. She would like to apologize, if that's okay with you. - Yeah, we appreciate it. Hang on, I'll get her. It's Pete. Paula wants to apologize. - Oh, good. You know what? She's probably washing up. I'm just gonna bring her the phone. You stay right here and calm down. - People are gonna think I'm like you. And that's gross. Emily. Emily? You've got a phone call, hon. Honey? Are you okay? - Do us all a favor, 'ro, and kill yourself. - Honey, you okay? - Poured out his vial into the air. And there came a great voice from the kingdom of heaven, from the throne. We are doing god's work! - Emily? Emily? Open the door. Open the door! Honey! Open the door right now! Vicki! Oh god, Vicki, Vicki! - Hang on, back off, back off, back off. Now push it with me. - Could Jude and I... Maybe we can go visit? - I wrote something down. I don't know how to do this. I truly believe that-- that once in your life you meet someone, someone who just changes your whole world around. I thank god, thank god for showing me how to love someone, for giving me Ryan. Someone once told me this quote you may have heard of. "Give me my Romeo, and when he shall die, "take him and cut him out into little stars, "and he will make the face of heaven so fine "because the only thing that lasts forever is love." - Hi. - Hi. - Why do people hate us so much? - I guess they don't understand love like ours. Maybe they never will. - Well, isn't our love the same as theirs? - It is. - Maybe someone should teach them that. - Emily. - Bye. - Bye. - How can i help you, sister? - First book of Peter, verse four, line eight. "Above all, love each other deeply, "because love covers over a multitude of sins." I think that covers my sin. How about yours? - Hey, you. I just wanted to let you know that I was safe, and from where I am right now, I have an amazing view of you in all of your glory. I love you. See you soon. Hey you. I just wanted to let you know that I was safe, and from where I am right now, I have an amazing view of you in all of your glory. I love you. See you soon. Hey, you. I just wanted to let you know that I was safe, and from where I am right now, I have an amazing view of you in all of your glory. I love you.
