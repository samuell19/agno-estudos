[instrumental music] [siren wailing] Many years ago there lived an emperor who cared so enormously for beautiful new clothes that he spent all his money on them. He had a coat for every hour of the day. Then one day, 2 cheats came. A weaver and a tailor. They persuaded the emperor and courtiers that they could weave beautiful clothes that only people who are stupid cannot see. "They would be capital clothes," thought the emperor. And he gave the 2 cheats a great deal of cash in hand so that they might begin their work at once. They immediately demanded the finest silk and the costliest gold. This they put into their own pockets and worked at the empty looms till late at night. Everyone pretended they could see the cloth the weaver was making. The night before the procession the weaver and tailor pretended to be hard at work, completing the clothes. Now the clothes are ready. When the emperor put on the new clothes he said.. "...one would think one had nothing on at all they are so light." The procession began and everyone pretended they could see the clothes until at last a child in the crowd shouted out "Oh, look. He's got nothing on!" And then, straight away, the whole crowd shouted "He has nothing on!" [instrumental music] Hans Christian Andersen doesn't say what happened to the cheats. Everything you're gonna hear about in this film you already know. You might not know the exact figures but you know the big issue. The rich are getting richer. Inequality is getting greater.. ...but it doesn't have to be like this. It can be different. Of course, rich people like you to think that it has to be this way so they, we have to be rich. But it doesn't. Things can change. Things do change. This is Grays in Essex where I grew up. I started at Little Thurrock Primary School the year that Margaret Thatcher got elected. And I would just like to remember some words of St. Francis of Assisi. "Lord, make me a channel of thy peace "that where there is hatred, I may bring love. "That where there is wrong I may bring the spirit of forgiveness." It always seemed a strange choice for Margaret Thatcher. A bold choice. "Where there is error, may we bring truth. Where there is doubt, may we bring faith." That's a bit more like the Thatcher we came to know and love. She is the truth, we must have faith in her. She is basically Jesus with a hair helmet on. A year later, she was joined by Ronald Reagan the new President of America. They were both followers of an economist called Milton Friedman. His theories were called "The Chicago School" because that is where he taught in the 1950s. For years, he was on the lunatic fringe of economics. But when Thatcher and Reagan came to power his ideas became the new orthodoxy. Cut government spending, cut tax rates reduce government ownership and operation of industries or regulation of industry. This free market fundamentalism was more than just a set of policies. It was a way of looking at the world. It took our worst instincts of selfishness and greed and made them the basis for how our society should be organized. For the last 35 years, these ideas have dominated both America and Britain. We've been told let the rich get richer and we will all benefit. But all that has happened is the gap has got bigger and bigger between the richest 1% and everybody else. [indistinct chatter] Hello. We have a 100 children here, is that correct? Are there a 100 of you? (all) Yes. If we imagine the wage of the ordinary worker to be 25,000 pounds, then in 1979, the richest 1% earned.. 50,000. Show me the bar. 150,000 pounds. Now, everyone, is that fair? (all) No. Now if the 99% are still earning 25,000 pounds the richest 1% earn? 375,000. Roxie's the 1% has gone up to 375,000 pounds, while yours the 99%, has stayed the same. Is that fair? (all) No! Roxie, do you think it's fair? No. Even Roxie doesn't think it's fair. Grays, as the name suggests, is a normal town. You could say a normal, suburban Essex town or a normal British town or a normal Northern European town. Give us a chip? Come on. Cheers. Thanks. Or even a normal town in a secular, western democracy. Thank you, man. Alright, mate. Do you, uh, do you remember me? I used to play with you down your road? - Who is it, Spencer.. - Dean. Dean! How the fuck are you? - Your brother's Warren. - That's it. Leigh, Pizzazz! [chuckles] Oh, Pizzazz. Pizzazz has become a church. They call that progress. There used to be a bloody good disco. Now what is it? A church. Oh, Christ. I remember being in there as a little kid, reading books. I remember being in there, like getting nicked. I remember getting beaten up there and then it becomes like a zoo. - I'm writing a book. - Go on. I'm writing a book called "Temple of Night." Why don't you tell me about it in the middle of the fucking road? Well, I'm going to 'cause that's how you promote a book. How are you doing, Russell? - I'm alright, mate. - I'm a West Ham supporter. - Yeah? - And, uh, well. I'm... I'm writing a book called "Temple of Night, Close to the Edge." - And me cousin's... - What's it about? It's about my life and me relation's book Jimmy Tibbs is out at the moment. - Oh, my God. - "Sparring With Life." [indistinct chatter] - Hello. - Hello [audience applauds] So we're gonna do, like, a bit of a readin'. Grays was never one of the seven wonders of the world. Grays was never an estuary Shangri-La. I suppose, in truth, it was always a bit of a dump. But coming back now it's shocking how much sadder this lesser depleted modern Grays is with its charity and betting shops its food banks and Wonga loans. But what is most shocking is that Grays is still a normal town, an average town. This is happening everywhere. The rich are getting richer. Everyone else is struggling. [instrumental music] Them's called knick-knacks, ain't it? But they're the only knick-knacks I've got. There's nothing wrong with having knick-knacks. - No. - I like 'em all there. Yeah, I'd wanna play with them though, if I was a bit younger. If I was 34.. [laughing] ...I think I'd muck around with them. - Any others? - No. - Just her, my one and only. - Like me? Yeah. Yeah. Hard is it? It is hard sometimes. What's your job then? Um, I work in local government. Can I ask how much you earn? Is that... I'm on about 20,000 a year. Don't think that's enough. Well.. I mean, uh, is it? No, no. No. I have to rely on the child benefit. - Mmm. - Tax credits, you know. Y... you just do your best. You just make sacrifices you know, don't go out much. I was doing drama originally, but I didn't like it. There's no money in any of that. Knock that on the head. What about university? You gonna go? I'd like to, yeah, I'm... I'm not 100% sure what I want to do yet, but I would like to go but it's just that the cost side of things. Mm. I... I do... don't want to, like not... not go to university. I'd really like to go, but it's just that worrying that if there is enough money and if there isn't what am I meant to do? Because I don't want like, mum to have money troubles I don't want.. Like, I don't want to have money troubles myself. I... I want the best for my child. I want the best. The reason I only have one child was because I couldn't afford to have any more children and I wanted the best for my child and I'm so proud of her. But it... it does frighten me for her to struggle at the start of her life.. ...you know, her adult life because she wants an education. It's not fair. I want her to achieve. And, you know, we'll have to get round it at the end of the day. I don't want her missing out. We'll have to do something. I fare-dodged my way out of Grays on the Fenchurch Street Train which transports commuting workers from Essex to the city of London. In the '80s you could see them building Canary Wharf from the train. A whole new town for bankers. Fifteen million square feet of offices. Home to HSBC, Morgan Stanley Citibank, Bank Of America, Credit Suisse. Ah. Never lose it. Joseph Campbell said "If you want to understand what's most important "to a society, don't examine its art or literature simply look at its biggest buildings." In modern western cities the biggest buildings are the banks. Bloody great towers of steel and glass. The tallest buildings. Phallic. Shiny. Glass that reflects rather than reveals. And then, in 2008 all these palaces came crashing down. Good evening, it's been a day of turmoil on the world's money markets after the collapse of Lehman Brothers. One of America's biggest investment banks. Bank of America is taking over Merrill Lynch in a fifty billion dollar deal. World's biggest insurance company could be heading for.. ...in 9 hours, we'll hear the rescue plan they hope will save.. This morning shares in RBS to use the technical term, tanked. What started in Wall Street has come to your high street. Lloyds TSB in emergency talks to try to take over battered HBOS. Share prices continued to tumble in the aftermath of the Lehman collapse. Karl Marx must be bobbing about in his grave tonight. "When capitalism fails the state provides," he might have said. The US treasury is constructing a massive taxpayer funded pot of cash to buy worthless debt from the banks. In the UK, we gave the banks 133 billion pounds. More than 4000 pounds per taxpayer. In the US, they pumped in two and a half trillion dollars. What happened to the bankers? Apart from a few people carrying cardboard boxes out of their offices, I don't remember there being many consequences at all. Just some people standing by a revolving door, looking confused. In Britain, since the crash bankers have paid themselves more than a hundred billion pounds in bonuses. Mr. Hornby, do you plan to give up any of your pension? - Good afternoon. - Mr. Hornby? Will you give up any of your pension? Andy Hornby was the man in charge at HBOS. A bank created a few years earlier by the merger of the Bank of Scotland and the Halifax Building Society. The Halifax was the biggest of the old building societies. Simple, local, mutually owned organizations set up to help people buy a house. For more than a century these societies worked well. Then, the free market zealots turned them into commercial banks. Mr. Hornby, will you say anything? Now the bailout of HBOS was costing 20 billion pounds. Do you decline to say anything at all? So what happened to Andy Hornby? Is it okay for you... He went off to become the CEO of Boots and then the bookies, Coral. He didn't pay back the millions he had earned from HBOS. He even made sure he kept his 240,000 pounds a year pension. The only people the bankers seemed interested in were their shareholders. Our shareholders, all of us have lost a great deal of money. I... I've apologized in full and am happy to do so again at the public meeting of our shareholders. It has affected shareholders. We were particularly concerned at the serious impact on shareholders. In 2010, the average pay of CEOs in big banks was 6.4 million pounds. Let's think about that for a bit. Two years after the financial crash, two years after the whole banking system had been bailed out by the British taxpayer the bosses of the banks were still taking home 300 times the average UK wage. Think of the tycoon in the glass tower. Think of the man who gets up and leaves the house before dawn to go out and clean windows. So, a cleaner working in the city would have to work for more than 300 years to make the same amount their boss would make in a year. So if they started work when America was still part of the British empire and were cleaning during the French Revolution then when Napoleon was getting beaten by Wellington God bless him, at Waterloo. If they work through the whole of Queen Victoria's reign when Tolstoy was writing "War and Peace," that took ages all the way through the Boer War the expeditions to Antarctica, the First World War that game of football on Christmas eve the Great Depression, the Second World War Hitler, all that lot, the swinging '60s sexual revolution, the Peel-Thatcher's '80s selling everything off, right up to now.. ...they would of just this minute earned what their boss makes in one year without even really trying. And that's not exposing some sort of scandal that we should all be shocked about. People cleaning the London banks are being paid the London living wage. This is what we've come to expect as normal. People in the same city.. ...in the same street. The same office, but living in different worlds. In the same office, people earning two or three hundred times what the next person is earning. We don't worry about it. We don't even really think about it. Let's look at what happened.. ...at the Royal Bank of Scotland. A bank where one individual was so focused on his own success, his own self-aggrandizement that he put at risk the livelihood of the 200,000 people who worked for the bank. The 15 million people who entrusted the bank with their life savings. The 60 million taxpayers who had to bailout the bank. Well, I'm here again at RBS because yet again they've done something wrong but they're not the only ones, there's 5 UK banks whose foreign exchange traders ripped off their own clients. I've sat in a room with the bosses of this bank and all the other banks. And I've sat in these rooms where they're pleading in the most gentile tones, don't overregulate us. Don't make it possible for us to go to jail. More or less every bank has been found to have broken the law. In my sector, UK utility sector 100% of the companies were taken over were without doubt, um, preceded by a huge amount of insider trading. A good example is to think of uh, a casino where you're sitting at a, at a table and the dealer is dealing everyone cards. The problem with banks became that there was now an asymmetric information problem where the dealer or the bank could see everyone else's cards yet was still betting in the game. You'd get shot for that in the Wild West. [gunshot] In the 1980s the... the last massive financial crisis in the States was the savings and loans crisis. 30,000 people who worked in financial services were criminally prosecuted and 3,000 of them went to prison. Do you know what the numbers are for this time around? Zero and zero. Well, it might be because all the organizations that got set up to police the banking industry are run by bankers. So it's like the same person can have done the crime and then judge himself. "Oh, anyone could've done that." "It was you that done it." "Yeah, I know, but I don't think I meant it." "Innocent." The city of London is one of the biggest financial centers in the world. Every year it chooses a new lord mayor from the medieval guilds. Like the company of tailors and the company of weavers. Of course, the people in the guilds aren't weavers or tailors anymore they're bankers or bond dealers traders or hedge fund managers. It's all a pretense. This year's mayor is Alan Yarrow. He's in the worshipful company of fishmongers. He ain't a fishmonger though, he's a banker. He was also on the committee of the Financial Services Authority. The group that was supposed to be policing the banks when all their illegal activities took place. We've got to have some bankers going to prison. They have to be accountable, they have to realize that there is consequence for criminal behavior. People showing indifference to right and wrong. People with a twisted moral code. People with a complete absence of self-restraint. Crime without punishment. Rights without responsibilities. Selfishness. Behaving as though your choices have no consequence. Unfortunately, David Cameron wasn't talking about bankers then, he was talking about looters. I was thinking "Why is he standing in front of the graffiti?" I mean, there's some graffiti there so mostly were talking about black people, unfortunately. Hundreds of people were arrested during the riots in 2011. The chief prosecutor said "One thing we learned in the disorder "is that if we get people in court fast "and get them sentenced, it acts as a deterrent. "It made people think twice. "They could see the criminal justice system "responding and that sent a really strong message from society that this was unacceptable." [indistinct shouting] The police were so keen to catch people that they drove around in this van. I got caught up in Lewisham at first. It was on the first day that it happened so I just thought to myself "Let me get home." On my way home, got to Catford and I was stopped from getting to my house. - Who by? What do you mean? - Police. They'd cordoned off this road. To... to prevent people from getting to PC World and Curry's and all that across the road. PC World? - Yeah. That place. - Well, he was on his own. And the officers could have let him go home. I could have gone, they could have said alright, go on home. So then I bumped into people that I knew 'cause it's Catford. It's my area. And unfortunately for me, I got caught up in it. And I picked up something on the way out. - What did you get? - iPod dock or something. An iPod dock, so what's the value of that? 100, 150. Something like that. So they charged me for theft. - Theft? - Yeah. And they sentenced me, they sentenced me 14 months dropped and that was dropped from 21. It was only dropped from 21 because of my occupation at the time. I was teaching, my character references were flawless... What do you do? I teach... teach dance. How much of the 14 did you.. Three and a half in. But he still had to go into prison, Russell. And he still had to do 3 bloody months, you know. - 3 months in Feltham? - Broke my heart. I was in there for Christmas and New Year's, that was mad. So, what's it like in Feltham? Always thought for young offenders, it must be horrible. It was a little bit easier for me at the time I went in there, because everyone was kind of in there for the riots. I spoke to people inside. "Oh, I stole a crate of juices." "And how long are you in here for?" "12 months..". I'm like, "What?" They're genuinely shocked. Like, I... I couldn't believe it. I was like, "Oh, my gosh." Water. Juice. In total, more than 1200 people were jailed and their sentences added up to more than 1800 years for stealing trainers and that. The youngest of them was a little 11-year-old boy. And what about the bankers? Did we set up special fast track 24-hour courts for them to act as a deterrent? Did we send a strong message that their behavior was unacceptable, irresponsible? How many bankers went to jail for ripping off their customers by selling 23 billion pounds worth of PPI which they didn't need? Or what about Standard Chartered money laundering involving 60,000 illegal transactions adding up to $250 billion? Or HSBC's money laundering? How many bankers will go to prison for the illegal rigging of the Libor interest rates which control trillions of dollars of transactions? Or the latest crime of the bankers. The foreign exchange rate scandal. The banks have paid billions in fines. But what do fines matter to people who can print money? When are some bankers gonna start going to prison? Alright, lads. How's it going? We're just trying to get some money back off the banks. RBS has been found guilty of illegal market rigging. If you've seen any of the men on this van please do not attempt to approach them. They're crafty. RBS, HSBC, Citibank JP Morgan, UBS and Barclays were all found guilty, hello, of illegal behavior. Since the bailout, George Osborne made 81 billion pounds worth of cuts. During the same timeframe, 80 billion pound worth of banker bonuses has been awarded. We wonder... how can you keep having those bonuses? I mean, economically I'm not an expert but it just doesn't seem fair, does it? - Hello. - Hello. - Sorry, mate. - I just need one, like.. I've got to just go into.. I'm popping into RBS. Hello. I've got an appointment to meet Ross McEwan. Right, okay. Could you just go to next to the door please, mister? - Just next to the door... - Ross McEwan. But I've sent an email already to speak to him. I cannot help you, sir. A way from reception, please, okay? - Shall I sit over here? - Yes, you can have a seat there. - Yeah? - Have a seat. Will you sit with me? No, I'm not gonna sit with you. Just have a seat, please. Last year, 8 billion was lost and yet 500 million paid out in bonuses. ...take a seat and someone is going to attend to you in a minute, so, if you just take a seat... I know, just running through some of the questions. I... I wouldn't.. I'm not in a position to answer your question. What? Sit. Someone is... someone's going to come attend to you. I'm starting to think that you're involved in some high level financial skullduggery. Someone is going to come attend to you... Did you know about the 500 million in bonuses last year? Did you get some of that? I would just ask you to take a seat, sir. Just take a seat. That makes me think you maybe got a couple of million bonus. Someone's going to come attend to you... Couple of million? 3 million? - Tell me if I'm getting warm. - No, just take a seat... 4 million in bonuses. Even though 8 billion was lost. - Just take a seat, sir. - You must've got a fortune. How much did you get? - Are you Ross McEwan? - No. And did you get a 3.2 million golden hello? He's got a golden shower. [Russell laughs] Don't ruin it, you scum. Also I'm looking for Fred Goodwin. He continues to get a 300 grand a year pension in spite of a 46 billion pay-out for, uh, the RBS from public money. Hello, there. Alright. How did the banks get into this mess? [bell rings] The markets used to be regulated but when the free market fundamentalists came to power they tore up the rules. They called it the Big Bang. "No one here tonight "needs reminding that the Big Bang is only a beginning." Just before the Big Bang the average number of daily trades at the London Stock Exchange was 20,000 amounting to about 700 million pounds of shares changing hands. In 2010, the average daily turnover in the city was 1.2 trillion pounds. That's a big number. Put simply, the amount of trades is now more than a thousand times bigger than it was before the Big Bang. [indistinct chattering] With all this money sloshing around the markets they're bound to be volatile. In 1987, there was Black Monday. Markets fell spectacularly. In 1992, there was Black Wednesday when currency speculators made fortunes betting against the pound. In 1997, there was the Asian Contagion. Six billion dollars disappeared from the stock markets of Asia. Everybody accepted that the financial crisis in 2008 was clearly a failure of free market capitalism. Even George Osborne. The banks and those regulating them believed that the bubble would never stop growing. That the markets were always self-correcting. That greed was always good, that their Ponzi schemes would never collapse that none of the debts would ever turn bad. Even George W. Bush. The market is not functioning properly. There has been a widespread loss of confidence. Even Alan Greenspan. We are in the midst of a once in a century credit tsunami. I've found a flaw I don't know how significant or permanent it is but I have been very distressed by that fact. The crisis was a crisis of ideas as well as a near terminal crisis of capitalism. Milton Friedman said "Every crisis is an opportunity." [indistinct shouting] It should have been an opportunity to change direction. To change the system. It still can be. [glass shattering] In New York and London, the financial centers of the world people came out onto the streets to demand change. The Occupy movement was founded. [indistinct chattering] I imagined for a moment as I wandered among them that this is what the '60s must've felt like. I remember describing it as being like a sort of a carnival of canvas. It was incredibly optimistic. It was like a spiritual experience. And what we did through Occupy was that we created that space where people could come and express their problems and realize "It's not just me, and not and I'm not the only one getting fucked." It was that community vibe. [audience cheering] Obama was elected in the US on a tide of optimism with the rhetoric of change and hope. Yes, we can. (all) Yes, we can. Yes, we can. Nearly 2 million people went to Washington to witness his inauguration. [cheering] Many journalists made comparisons with FDR. I, Franklin Delano Roosevelt do solemnly swear, that I will.. In 1929, there'd been the biggest financial crash of the 20th century, followed by the Great Depression. The homeless camped out in front of the White House. Force was used to crush protests. [gunshots] FDR offered an alternative to the policies of austerity. ...that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself. When he came to power in 1933 there was a banking crisis. He immediately raised income tax on the richest to 63% to pay for his New Deal. Guns are everywhere. North, south, east, and west. In your town and in mine. He invested the money in transport infrastructure and social housing. Creating jobs, wealth and homes for the people. Every designation in the United States of a public low-rent housing project is a rededication of our democracy to the principle that all men are created equal. [indistinct chattering] In Manhattan, after the Second World War the Mitchel-Lama program built co-op housing for middle-income families. Now many of these blocks are being privatized. How long have you been here? 44 years. Well, what would happen if we do go private.. ...this apartment obviously would be worth, maybe.. ...close to a million dollars. Wow, of course. So, everyone who's here.. ...pretty much wants to be a lottery winner and win the big ones. They envisioned the apartment more as an economic asset more than an actual living space. People here have now decided that.. ...this is their legacy to their children so we should go private so they can get money so they can provide for their children. Privatization of housing has also taken place in Britain. We are the party of Thatcher's Right to Buy. 2 million council homes have been sold off under the Right to Buy scheme. Because of this, we now have 2 million people on waiting lists for affordable social housing. But privatization is still continuing. Like at the New Era Estate near where I live. But the people who live here are fighting back. [indistinct chattering] When they came in, we signed our new tenancies for the first of July. Um, they went up about 160 odd pounds a month. Richard Benyon is the richest Tory MP in the country. They own over 300 properties in Hackney. How did they get their money in the first place, the Benyons? It was inherited, their money, wasn't it? They emerged from a particular vagina if you come out of that one, money comes at ya. You have got my child sitting on your lap as you say that. Yeah. [laughter] Remember that there are children here today and that this is a family protest. As you know, Edward Benyon of Westbrook has bought our estate and we are facing eviction in 2016. Who made the posters? Rose, she lives in this block here. We've got "Westcrook leave our homes alone" and.. "Don't let New Era, be the end of an era." - Good slogan. - Yeah. Who come up with that? [indistinct chatter] When you think of the first rents that we had just 640 a month they now gonna wanna charge that a week. Now that's de facto, evicting everyone, innit? [indistinct chattering] We pay 9 billion pounds in housing benefits that private landlords like Benyon and Westbrook every year because there isn't enough affordable social housing. [indistinct chattering] If we want to cut the benefit bill, we could control the rents charged by private landlords. If that sounds a bit radical, it's worth remembering that more than one million apartments in New York have regulated rents. Even blocks like these on Central Park West used to be controlled. Now apartments here sell for millions. What's really important about it as well is that we're not just standing back and allowing it to happen. I think what's so exciting about it is that people like us just normal people, can actually make a stand. We did make a difference, Benyon, the Benyon estates did pull out the purchase of the estates so now it's just about doing the same to Westbrook. ♪ Hey Westcrook leave our homes alone ♪♪ Roger Waters might have something to say about it. [laughter] Westbrook has a long track record in New York and not a good one. I went to City Hall to see the mayor, Bill de Blasio. As usual, I was early so I took the opportunity to chat to his team. - Mitchell-Lama. - The Mitchell-Lama. He's a nice guy that Mitchell Lama. Is he a real person? No, it's a trick, you're toying with me. I'm right behind your five key principles of job growth. What's the matter, Michael? Don't get jealous. You're the very next person I'm gonna touch. [laughs] Wait till I get him home. It's ridiculous what we do. - Is he here? - Yeah. You are fucking joking. You are kidding me, we're not gonna be late for a mayor, not again. Westbrook was a firm that... uh, ran afoul of the authorities here in New York City and New York State. Westbrook out! Westbrook out! Westbrook out! Our city government found a huge number of violations of our law by Westbrook and unfair treatment of tenants and... and attempts to interfere with tenants who organized for their own rights. We're here to tell David Cameron, Boris Johnson and everyone else in a position of power we the residents of the New Era Estate are staying in our homes. [cheering] The triumph of the ideology of the free market zealots is that we no longer believe in collective action. Margaret Thatcher called the unions the Enemy Within. [cheering] Through a mixture of legislation and brute force she broke them. That's one of the reasons why we've had 6 years of stagnating wages for most people whilst the 1% have been getting richer and richer on the back of what is called "Quantitative easing." Quantitative easing. Quanti-ta-ta-tative easing. The quantitative easing comes... comes from the Central Bank saying "Here, have a load of free money." - Free money? - Yeah. 375 billions worth in... in... in Britain 7 trillion I've calculated, dollars worldwide, in... - Of free money? - Yeah, free money. Think of it like one of those like champagne, um, pyramids. You could, the top, you know, the top glass is gonna be the banking system. It took a long while... So you've got to fill all of them up before you get any champagne in Detroit. Yeah, yeah, and... and surprise, surprise you won't be surprised to know that not much of the cham... champagne has actually trickled out. They're all drinking it as well... on the way down. Absolutely, because that's the that's what the banking system is. They printed up out of thin air they just decide to create 4 trillion dollars. With that 4 trillion they could have given every non-millionaire household in the United States $40,000 each. But meanwhile since QE started we've lost 10 million jobs full-time jobs in the United States. We've been gaining part-time jobs but we're losing full-time well-paying jobs. How did we let this happen? If you aren't angry enough to kick a pig into a ditch, then you've not understood it properly. The losses of the banking system were taken on by the state and therefore instead of having this big a debt suddenly the state has this big a debt. A decade lost to debt. The damage done by the debts. We are in a debt crisis. We must deal with our debts. [indistinct chattering] At the end of the Second World War public debt was twice as high as it is now. But we didn't have austerity. There was a belief that things should be fairer. That there should be equality of opportunity for everyone. We invested in schools, hospitals social housing, transport. This investment made the economy grow. Which gave us the money to pay off the debt. For the last 5 years we've had austerity we've cut investment, wages has stagnated and our debt is bigger now than it was 5 years ago. Turning the crisis from a banking crisis into what we call a fiscal crisis of the state finances was the mechanism whereby ordinary people all over the world were gonna be forced to pay.. It's a con also. It's a switcheroo. It's the Tennessee switcheroo. They caused it, they paid for it. Our public sector pension system is unaffordable. There are programmers that will be cut. There are jobs that will be lost. It means finding new sources of income to support our universities and colleges. [indistinct chattering] That source of income was the students themselves. It was just bad luck. If I were a month older, I would have paid 3 grand fee to go a year for university and now I'm paying 9 grand. So by the time I leave university, I've, um 36 grand of debt. I'm never gonna pay that off. Most people are never gonna pay that off. Now, as of 2014, the average debt of students is 44,000 pounds. I'm doing med, I'm doing medicine so.. ...basically I pay 9 grand a year and I came in just as the 9 grand fee rise. Um, so on tuition alone I'm paying 54 grand and then because I'm from a low-income background like she said, um, I also get the higher loan. Um, so across the 6 years I'm probably gonna be in debt of at least 80,000 if not more than that. - Wow. - Yeah. So I know people that just didn't go to uni purely because of the fee rises, 'cause they just thought "What's the point of being straddled by debt for the rest of my life?" It wasn't us, it wasn't students who created the financial crash, it was the people in the city that created that crash. Now, listen here, Jake, I need to talk to you about, uh why you've come to this meeting in murderous gloves? [all laughing] It's a bit cold. [all laughing] Now, 6 years on, we know that the solution to the crisis of banking was to smash the welfare state. That's what, that's what neoliberalism achieved. It took the crisis and it imposed a neoliberal solution. The only problem is it doesn't work. Prices and bills keep going up. Petrol, electricity, the weekly shop. On the news, it's job losses cutbacks, closures. You think about tuition fees house prices, the cost of a deposit. You wonder how our children are gonna manage. Uh, how old, how old are you? 7. Well, I'm 8 in January. What about you, how old are you, darling? Do you know how old you are? Are you 4? - No. - Right, some confusion. - So like, are you... - I'm 6. - What are you, darling? - No, I'm 4. - Good girl. - No, I'm 5. I'm 5, I'm 5. Let's not get bogged down in details. They're getting on alright? You're getting on very well at school, aren't you? Yeah. - You're quite clever, are ya? - Yeah. She's quite bright, yeah. - What are you saying? - I'm not bright. I'm not bright. You're... you're not bright, no. Oh, darling. "I'm not bright. I'm not. No. I'm not." [indistinct shouting] Yeah and you're 4, don't put yourself under enormous pressure to be bright at 4, Ebony. I'm a legal secretary. I used to work full-time in the day getting the train to and from work you know, city life and stuff. And then when I had my first one, Ella uh, they let me go onto the evening shift. So I got the best of both worlds. Am I allowed to ask how much you earn or is that, uh, bad? - Yeah, I think you can. - How much do you earn a year? Um, 24,000. That doesn't seem like enough. No, there's never enough money. It's a lot of work looking after these kids, innit? Yeah. So you've got to do that, you've got to do the job. The girls finish at quarter past 3 I pick them up from school, so.. [indistinct chattering] Good work, good work. And then straight away I'm on the A13 towards Leyton. I finish at midnight and if I'm sleeping at my mother-in-law's that night I'm home by, um, 12:30. Um, sort of straight in bed.. Obviously, other times you sleep at your mother-in-law's where you've dropped them? Yeah. Yeah. Ebony, never do that again until you're 25. And, um, sometimes she stays here. So it's easier for me if she stays here 'cause obviously the school's around the corner. But if I stay at hers, we have to be on the road before 8 o'clock. Whose fault is it that your life's this hard? I don't know. It's Danny. - Who's Danny? - Danny. - Who's Danny? - That's their dad. [laughter] Danny, you've a lot to answer for. It sounds like a really... I got it for my birthday. That's a bloody good present that. I like it a lot. I like it. That's g... grueling schedule you must be living under total pressure. What do you do to unwind and relax? Not a lot. Ain't got any love in your life, any relaxation, any peace? Um... not at the moment, no. When do you ever meet people who are happy, genuinely happy? Only children, mentally ill people and daytime television presenters and I've been all 3. [audience cheering] "What gravity is this that holds us down? "Who installed this low suffocating sky? "There is a crack in everything that's how the light gets in," sang Leonard Cohen. He knew the answer was there, that's why he became a Buddhist and fucked off to live in them mountains. Either that or it's because his management nicked all his money, we can't be sure. We live in a atomized and fragmented world. Margret Thatcher said "There's no such thing as society." She wanted us all to see ourselves as individuals. But one individual against a powerful corporation is always gonna lose. Where is the fairness we ask? For the shift worker leaving home in the dark hours of the early morning. Guillermo is one of these workers. He gets up at 5:45 every morning. His flat in Seven Sisters costs him the best part of 200 pounds a week. His travel into the center of town costs him 25 quid a week. He works as a cleaner. He starts at 6:30 every morning and finishes at 8 o'clock every night. This is Oxford Circus. Change here for Bakerloo and Central line. He is paid 6.87 pounds an hour. The aspiration to work the extra hour. He gets 3 breaks, but 2 of those are unpaid. He doesn't work for some dodgy employer. He works for John Lewis. John Lewis is supposed to be a decent company. But they outsource their cleaning so they don't have to worry about paying a decent wage or pensions or sick pay. That's what outsourcing does. It allows companies to employ people for far less than they would do normally. Like the outsourcing from councils or the outsourcing from the NHS. We're all in this together. Both myself and Tom work for the same company. It used to be a local authority. I'm a support worker in a day center. I work with people with profound multiple learning disabilities. I do absolutely everything from personal care to feeding, to medication. How has it changed since it's been privatized? T... they do nasty things to us like give us nine and a half percent pay cuts. You got a nine and a half percent pay cut? I was TUPEd over to a company called "Look Ahead" about 4 years ago and, uh, straight away we had to accept a 17% pay cut. That's out of order, innit? 'Cause "Look Ahead" sounds so optimistic. Look ahead. You're fucked, look. [all laughing] Um, about a year ago, they wanted us to accept another 17% pay cut, but this time we got a 100% union membership and we were able to stop it from happening by balloting to go on a strike action. When you hear on the telly, or whatever oh, these privatization firms are coming in the way you always hear it on the news is they're gonna make things more efficient and you always think "Oh, that's good, everyone likes efficient." But what that means is they're gonna stop paying people that work their reasonable wages. We are all in this together. [whistle blowing] Go to the Warburton factory near Birmingham. Meet the people who work all hours. I work for Warburtons, my wages covers.. ...my rent, my food, petrol. I can't save, I can't go on holidays. Well, I tell you what Warburtons owners paid themselves last year, 5.4 million. We had a great success last year at, uh, Hovis in Wigan uh, where we took on, uh, an employer over the issue of zero hour contracts and their use of zero-hour contracts. There was 204 people that went out on strike. That's 180 full-time employees and 24 zero-hour people actually went out on strike. And those 24 hour-zero contract people became full-time employees, uh, during that dispute. Oh, what a brilliant success. Meanwhile, Gavin Darby at Premier Foods he earned, in, uh, 2013, 1.6 million. I bet old, uh, Gavin Darby with his 1.6 million I bet deep down he don't feel good about it. [drumbeats] We are still all in this together. Tesco is Britain's biggest retailer. It makes profits of more than 2 billion a year. It employs 300,000 people in the UK but it doesn't pay them a living wage. How much do you get, Tracey, if you don't mind me asking? Um, I get 7.27 pounds an hour. Are you working full-time? Um, virtually full-time, yeah. I have, uh, another job in the evening so obviously, well, I'm not getting paid enough. Where I work we're paid 7.79 an hour. Which apparently is the best. It is, actually. Well, I haven't had a pay rise in 7 years. My husband hasn't had one for 9 years. We know how much a... a can of baked beans.. ...costs a year ago and we know how much it costs now. But we haven't seen that reflected in our wages. It says Philip Clark of Tesco was being paid 6.9 million pound a year, so he needs that. To live on? Sainsbury's have made 4 billion since that crash. They've paid 20 million.. ...to their, uh, CEO since that crash. Tesco's, uh, are selling a private jet for 35 million quid. It's got 5 private jets, uh, that's Tesco's. Who here works for Tesco? Do you think that they could afford to pay you some more? Definitely. Why are we subsidizing massive corporations like Tesco by paying benefits to people who work for them so they can pay them less? We spend about 28 billion pounds a year on benefits for people in work. If we want to cut the welfare bill, a good start would be to make sure everyone is paid a living wage. Here, the minimum wage was only introduced in 1999. If it had increased at the same rate as bosses' pay it would now be nearly 20 quid an hour. Instead it is 6.70 pounds. In the last 5 years, has, uh, your wages gone up? Very slowly but the cost of living has gone up as well. The wages go up a little bit, cost of living goes up a bit more, doesn't it? Most low-paid jobs are in retail cleaning, hotels, cafes, hospitals and nursing homes. All the jobs that have to be done here that can't be outsourced to India or China. So, don't believe anybody who tells you that unemployment would rise if care home workers got paid a decent wage. They wouldn't, unless you wandered into a care home yourself and started working for free. In the 35 years since Thatcher came to power growth has been less than in the 35 years before. And twice as many people have been out of work. No wonder Grays is looking a bit rough around the edges. It's changed though, innit, Grays? - Has it got better or worse? - Worse. Yeah, I thought it had. A while ago, I wrote an excellent book called "My Booky Wook." It was about growin' up in Grays in the '80s. In those days, if someone in Grays had gone into a locally-owned bookshop and bought the book half the money would have gone to the shop and stayed in Grays. Another part would have gone to the publishers in London. The bookshop would have paid its rates which the local council would spend on local services. The shop would have employed people here in Grays. Those people would pay their income tax and their council tax. All that money would have stayed here. Those employees would have used other local businesses like the barbers or the grocers. They would also employ local people who'd pay their income tax and their council tax. A barber would go and spend his money in the grocers. All that money and work would have been here in Grays. When I was a teenager there was a shopping mall built nearby called Lakeside. Not that there was a lake, they had to build one to justify the name. All the national chains were in the mall. So their profits went to London. Local shops disappeared. The shopping center was owned by an international company. So the rent went to them. But the shops still pay tax they still pay the workers here in Grays who lived locally and shopped locally and paid their council tax locally. If the book is bought online, say on Amazon then that money would never make it into the local community. It would all disappear to some offshore tax haven and very few people would benefit from the profits. Taxes in some respects are an extraordinary idea. It's... it's the way in which complete strangers can actually cooperate to provide the infrastructure that we need to run a modern society. I am in favor of cutting taxes at any time, under any circumstances, for any excuse. When the free market fundamentalists talk about cutting taxes, what they mean is cutting taxes for the rich. On the 4th of January next year the main rate of V-A-T will rise from seventeen and a half percent to twenty percent. V-A-T is a tax that costs the ordinary worker twice as much as the rich. That's why it's gone up from 8% in 1979 to 20% now. But the taxes paid by the rich have been cut. Thatcher and Reagan slashed inheritance tax capital gains tax and the top rate of income tax. What this meant was the rich 1% were taking home twice as much as they had been. Now, you think they'd be happy, but paradoxically cutting taxes made them want to have higher and higher salaries. When Thatcher came to power, bosses of big companies in Britain used to earn 10 times the salary of the average worker. Certainly, I've never felt underpaid or undervalued. Uh, one earned what one earned and it seemed perfectly reasonable at the time. But now they earn about a 150 times as much as everyone else. We're told that the market decides that the bosses are paid by results. This isn't true. There's no real connection between the rise of bosses' pay and the success of a business. At Barclays, in 1979 the boss got 87 grand a year. In 2011, Bob Diamond paid himself 6.3 million quid. Even though company's share price had dropped by 30% in the 10 preceding years. We are looking for Bob Diamond. Hello, mate, have you seen Bob Diamond? Even his name sounds slippery. Will some bankers, please very gently go to prison? I love you, you're... you're absolutely gorgeous. I mean, I can't argue. You're beautiful. If I wasn't busy trying to create financial justice I'd be right out this van and I'd snog you so hard, mate. I'm hoping to meet, I've written his name down "Antonio Horta Osorio." Is that the right name? Did I say it right? Or someone that can talk on his behalf. I get scared in here. - Why? Are we intimidating? - Yeah. I feel a bit nervous. There's something sexy about the whole financial world as well, huh? Is there? I'll tell you what. They nearly kicked me head in at Royal Bank of Scotland so you're a treat, you are. Alright. Can I practice what I'm going to say if a person comes down? What's that? I've got to talk to Antonio Horta Osorio that's the boss of Lloyds, about whether or not anyone from Lloyds should get a stretch as a result of the Libor irregularities. Libor, I don't know what that even means. It's to do with the financial world. Uh, in 1980, the Lloyds boss got 80 grand a year. If the average wage has gone up by the same proportion as the Lloyds bosses' wage has gone up the average wage would now be 450 grand a year. That's the average. So these are the questions. A correction is required. Since I said that, a couple of weeks ago Lloyds have announced another pay package for their boss. This time, it's 11.5 million quid a year so if the ordinary wage had gone up at that rate over the last 35 years, the average worker would now be earning 900,000 pounds a year. Which is reasonable for an average worker. Hello, I'm from the media agency. - I'm Russell. - My name is Laura Brookin. - Hello, Laura Brookin. - Adam Pledger. Hello, Adam. There's a few questions. Can I run 'em through 'em with you now? Okay, we'll need to, we need to get.. - You got lots of questions. - That was, that's RBS' one. - I've already done them. - Right, okay. That was hard work that one, I tell you. - Are you short-sighted? - No, I'm just blind. - Actually blind? - Yes. Because I wondered when your hand came out. I can't see your face. I remember what you look like. Do you still look like Jesus? Do you wanna touch my face or whatever you do? Yeah, that's a good idea. Ah, you've got that horrible beard. Oye! See if you can tell if I'm handsome. I know you're a pretty good-looking fella 'cause you're a bit of a hit with the ladies. [laughs] I do alright. Thank you very much. Very kind. Anyway I mispronounced it. It was, did, should anyone.. from Lloyds have gone to prison for their involvement in Libor? And then... in 1980 when I was 5, the fella that ran Lloyds earned 80 grand a year. Now the fella that runs Lloyds earns 5 million a year. If the average workers money had gone up by the same amount that means the average worker would earn 450 grand a year. So that's much more. [instrumental music] Kwasi works as a cleaner at Goldman Sachs. His shift starts at 10:00 PM at night and finishes at 6:30 in the morning. He then works a second job, cleaning a pub. [indistinct chatter] Last year, Goldman Sachs' bankers earned an average of 3 million pound each. If the bankers gave up one day of their pay, they could practically double the wages of all their cleaners. [music continues] [indistinct chattering] But despite the massive inequality of incomes wealth is even more unfairly divided. Now before, if you remember we were talking about income, weren't we? (all) Yes. We were. Now we are talking about wealth. Now, imagine this. If you took all of the money in our country what is called Great Britain was divided up fairly so each person had the same amount how much money would each person have? (all) 200,000! 200,000 pounds. Can I just ask, is that fair? (all) Yes. But that isn't what's happening, is it? - No. - No. No, it's not actually. That was... that was a rhetorical question I just asked you. So let's have a look at what the economic situation actually is. Hold your numbers in the air. [indistinct chatter] Those aren't your real name. Okay, well, uh, after that very brief succinct and effortless piece of organization and I'd like to thank all of you children for being so very focused and helpful. What we now have is a more accurate portrayal of how money is divided up in our country. The 50 poorest percent at the back how much have you got? 20,000 pounds! Excellent. Now the middle 40, how much have you got? A 125,000 pounds. A 125,000 pounds, the middle 40. And the 9 of you over here I'm going to call you the moderately elite 9 how much have you got? 900,000 pounds. 900,000 pounds? Yes! You're so sweet for tyrants. Okay, Roxy, once again the 1%, how much have you got, darling? More than 5 million pounds. 5,800,000 pounds. Is that fair? No! It doesn't seem fair. No, it must be fair because if it's actually happening, it must be fair! Is it fair? No. What should we do to make it more fair? [clamoring] [chanting] Share it! Share it! Share it! Share it! If you were in a school playground with 20 kids in it and a couple of them took all the toys you wouldn't just say, "Oh, well, that's life." You'd explain to them that sharing is a basic human value and then you'd redistribute the toys. Let's overlook the fact that in this allegory you're hanging around a playground with unsupervised children. We might be teachers or lollipop men or something. It's one of the triumphs of the free market fundamentalists that we equate their ideology with modernity. We've been persuaded that that the free market is the future when, in fact, actually, we're going back to the past where you were born rich or born poor and that's the end of the story. In the old days, there was a lot of wealth and it was concentrated in the richest 1%. Then things got fairer. The effects of the war and taxation meant that the value of capital was halved in relation to income. So what mattered was what you earned through your work. But since the free market fundamentalists took over capital is more and more important and as capital grows inheritance is becoming more and more important. In Haringey, one of the poorest boroughs in London these terraced houses now cost more than a million pounds. That's 40 years of the average wage. 30 years ago, they would have cost 6 or 7 years of the average salary. So if you want to be able to buy a house you better hope you've got rich parents. [indistinct chatter] The top 1% of people in Britain own a quarter of the wealth. That's bad. But globally it's worse. Oxfam say a bus with the 80 richest people in the world on it would contain more wealth than the collective assets of half the Earth's population. We couldn't fit 80 people in 1 bus. So we put them on 2 buses, a mini convoy of capital. Who are these 80 people? How did they make their money? Well, 4 of them are heirs to the Walmart fortune. [indistinct chatter] They pay their workers so little that the American taxpayers have to give them $6 billion a year in welfare. We're trying desperately to fight against the.. The media likes to celebrate self-made billionaires but more than half the wealth on this bus has been inherited. [instrumental music] [horn honking] Between 1990 and 2010 Bill Gates' fortune grew from $4 billion to $50 billion. Maybe he deserves it, maybe he don't. But Lilianne Bettencourt, heir to the L'Oreal fortune also so her money grow by the same amount even though she's never worked a day in her life. Why? Because she's worth it. If you own the world, if you own all assets I think you can seriously achieve about 10%. When you can get returns on capital of up to 10% then the rich get richer and richer without doing anything. And even self-made fortunes quickly change to inheritance. Steve Jobs' widow is worth more than $10 billion just for having been married to Steve Jobs. I mean, I know he's difficult but $10 billion difficult? I'd have a go at him for that! In fact, everyone on this bus has more than $10 billion. There's people who made fortunes from the privatization of state industries, look at them. There's some people who made fortunes from speculation in the financial market. [spits] Oh. And there's Rupert Murdoch. He turns up everywhere, doesn't he? If Rupert Murdoch makes 10% a year that means he's earning a billion dollars a year without doing anything. Before the free market revolution that sort of income was taxed at 98% so people couldn't get rich by sitting around doing nothing. Now, Rupert Murdoch has companies registered in tax havens all around the world and it's estimated that he pays 6% in tax. That's wrong. That's grotesque. If we have a tax that took 90% of their wealth the poorest person on the bus would still have a billion left. But we could double the wealth of people like those who live in Makuru. Would Rupert really be unhappy if there was a wealth tax of 90%? No! He'd be fine. And so would George Soros and Liliane Bettencourt and Mrs. Jobs and Warren Buffet and everyone else on the billionaire fun bus. So don't be downhearted, fellas, we're coming for your money. We inherited a tax system where some in the city were paying lower rates than their cleaners. The IRS publishes the 400 largest incomes. The most recent data showed that the average income of those people was $200 million. A number of them were paying at a rate below 10% including payroll taxes. Now that's still a lot less than my cleaning lady. The tax charge has increasingly shifted from those who can afford to pay on to those who can't afford to pay. A quick way of making things fairer is to tax the rich. The rich would like us to think that it is impossible to tax them. As though by taxing them would be creating some gray, socialist depressing East Germany place where it rains all the time. But when Brigitte Bardot and Jean-Paul Belmondo were making France look like the coolest place on Earth the rich were being taxed up to 90% of their income. The French look back on those years as Les Trente Glorieuses The Glorious Thirty that means. In America, the same thing from the end of the Second World War to the end of the 70s taxes on rich individuals were as high as 95%. That was when America was at its most powerful its heyday, from Steve McQueen to JFK Marilyn Monroe to Bob Dylan. The 50s and 60s looked pretty good from here. In Britain, the same thing. Taxes as high as 95% for the rich with a Tory Prime Minister saying "You've never had it so good." Followed by the swinging 60s when everyone wanted to be in London. You can have mini-skirts and high taxes. You can have fun and color and sunshine and sex and comedy and still have a fairer society. You can even win the World Cup. [cheering] I'm a low tax, small government Conservative. We're often told that if we increase taxes on the rich they'll just try and avoid them but in fact, when taxes were cut there was a massive increase in tax avoidance. Morning, Bernie. It is hard to know how much tax people are dodging because they like to be really secret about it. But when the head of Formula One Bernie Ecclestone was taken to court in Germany they found that he had an unpaid UK tax liability of 1.2 billion pounds. In 2008, the tax collectors agreed to let him off 1190 million of it. He just gave them 10 million quid. The best estimate I've seen of how much personal wealth is held offshore evading tax onshore is an estimate that came out of a research team in New York in 2012 and that ranged between 21 to 32 trillion US dollars. For every billion of benefit fraud there are 9000 prosecutions. For every billion of income tax fraud there are 5 prosecutions. In other words, if you are poor, you get prosecuted. If you are rich, you get let off. In 2005, Sir Philip Green was paid 1.2 billion pounds. He said that Topshop and all the other companies he owns were really owned by his wife, Tina. And she lives in Monaco which happens to be a tax haven. - That's not Monaco! - That's not Monaco! This is London, I thought. There you go, mate. Here you go, mate. It's about Topshop tax avoidance. Uh, in Topshop, they don't pay their tax. Take it easy. One of the tax haven devices is this whole idea of being non-domicile for tax purposes in... in Britain. Um, and this one is just so bizarre you couldn't make it up. Good morning. Lord Rothermere is the owner of the "Daily Mail." A paper that is very proud to be British. Rothermere owns his shares in the "Daily Mail and General Trust" uh, through a Bermudan company called Rothermere Continuation Limited. Trusts are one of the basic building blocks of... of any offshore structure. Even the less sophisticated ones would typically start with a trust. - Hello. - We heard about you in politics. Good! Good girl! And what these structures allow someone like Rothermere to do is to turn what is really UK income into overseas income. Okay. These so-called non-doms like Lord Rothermere avoid more than four billion pounds tax per year. - Hello? - Hello, mate. I just wondered does Lord Rothermere live here, please? Do you want to speak to him? I'd love to speak to Lord Rothermere, yeah. What's your name again? Say it's Russell Brand to speak to Lord Rothermere. Say it's about living here and taxes. You can acquire a domicile, you can also lose it. - Hello, I just... - One moment please. He is just getting off the telephone. Okay. I just wanted to ask if Lord Rothermere lives here? Yes, he lives in here. Does he pay his taxes in England, do you know? I don't know. Ah, yeah, I don't know either. Like, 'cause if he's domiciled here, he should pay taxes here. I just wondered, one, did he pay inheritance tax on the 1.5 billion, uh, when he inherited the "Daily Mail" off his dad whose name was also Lord Rothermere by coincidence. And also if it's true that he runs the "Daily Mail" out of Bermuda which is a tax haven and controls it from Jersey which is also a tax haven? Hello? Lord Rothermere! Lord Rothermere! Jersey, where Rothermere hides his cash has 400 billion dollars of assets in trusts. We know, for example that.. ...the Prime Minister David Cameron's family trust is offshore. His chancellor, George Osborne, his family trust is offshore. Uh, many other cabinet members have offshore trusts. It's become the norm. As part of the austerity cuts this government introduced a so-called "Bedroom tax." It affects half a million people. They hope that it will save 500 million pounds a year. Bedroom tax is for people who, my age or just younger, living on their own and they want us to get out to go to a... a smaller accommodation. But I've got a lot of health issues you know, which I've got. I'm due to have two, um, hip replacements. They've said I've got bones of a 90-year-old woman! Oh, bloody hell! She'll want 'em back. I want both back. Done a joke, why not? Stuck it in. - You've gotta have a laugh, ain't ya? - Gotta have a laugh. Yeah, gotta have a laugh. Life's too short, innit? Here today, gone today. Back tomorrow, gone tomorrow, innit? You can't come back.. Hold on a minute. You said here today, gone today. Back tomorrow.. You can't get reincarnated.. Once you're gone, unless we're Hindus. In which case.. If non-doms like Rothermere paid their tax then we wouldn't need a bedroom tax at all. When you start talking about tax, you're talking about power. But I say, it's time to close corporate loopholes shut offshore tax havens and restore balance and fairness to our tax co. More than half of world trade passes on paper through tax havens. Half of all banking assets are off shore. There are whole industries set up to avoid paying tax. Private Equity is really built on tax avoidance. Boots, for example was paying about 140 million pounds a year in tax in the UK before it was taken over by Private Equity. After that, its tax bill fell to around 50 million pounds a year. Britain was very early in the tax haven market. It was a deliberate policy to set up places like the Cayman Islands as a tax haven. How daft were we? And yet we did it, we created the offshore world and it's been a disaster for us and everybody else. 80% of the hedge fund industry is based in the Cayman Islands. The reason Cayman has 80% of the world's hedge funds has to do with regulatory efficiency. No, it isn't. Hedge funds are in the Cayman Islands because there is no tax. No corporation tax. No income tax. Corporation tax cut next year and the year after and the year after that and the year after that, because we are all in this together. Corporation tax has come down but corporation tax avoidance has gone up. [indistinct chatter] Apple is the richest company in the world. It makes profits of more than a billion dollars every single week. And yet they only pay their workers a couple of dollars an hour. The Google arrangement and the Apple arrangements are almost identical. They both basically use a double Irish scheme. They both end up with enormous piles of cash sitting in Bermuda. One part of the company, Apple Operations International reported net income of 30 billion dollars but claimed to have no tax residence. Like they're just a drifting band of techno gypsy people. I mean, it's difficult because I've got one as well. Apple in the USA has so little money in its parent location that it actually has to borrow to be able to pay dividends to its shareholders. Because it can't bring in all the cash it's got in Bermuda because it would be taxed if it did. Hello. Want one? Apple avoid their taxes. You won't be able to distribute the leaflets in store because... Not in the store? This is distorting corporate behavior. This is tax avoidance gone mad. This is where the tax tail is wagging the dog. Want one? Apple avoid their taxes. Hello, officer! This is about Apple avoiding paying their taxes which obviously we need to pay for public facilities like the police force. Also, I like the police. Good, we like you, Mr. Brand. Thanks a lot. Even though I used to get in trouble with the police. We're on the same team. We talk the language of tax competition. Now, this language is illiterate from an economic point of view. It would be far more accurate to talk about tax wars. We will always have the most competitive corporate taxes in the G20. Lower than Germany, lower than Japan lower than The United States. That is our commitment. If you have a common market, you have at the very least got to have some degree of common tax policy. I'm doing this because Vodafone don't pay their taxes. Innit? That's an overreaction, if anything! Vodafone ain't paying their taxes. 14 billion of corporate tax loss means 6 billion benefit cuts for disabled people. Do... do you mind taking a leaflet? - Yeah. - Thank you. We're campaigning for the big companies to pay their taxes. - Well done, mate. - They should be paying their taxes. They should. We know, we know. [on TV] Danny Alexander wrote in to the "Daily Telegraph" today the Chief Secretary to the Treasuries accusing the Conservatives of pandering to UK. You can see that, I suppose, what was inevitably going to happen that parties want to emphasize their own distinctiveness before the election.. Nice? Angela, have a good day. - Bye. - Bye. [instrumental music] Angela has cerebral palsy. To live independently, she relies on a care worker paid for by her council. Since 2010, council budgets have been slashed by 30%. This means fewer hours for care workers and often lower wages. [indistinct chatter] Angela is also a campaigner against government plans to cut the Independent Living Fund for disabled people in 2015. [indistinct announcement on PA] The fund provides 330 million pounds for 20,000 disabled people. Less than the bonuses paid to RBS bankers this year. A bank we own. [indistinct chatter] Why don't we just have a tax on bankers' pay instead of cutting disability benefits? Starbucks sold 400 million pounds of hot milky drink things last year. Yet, for 14 out of 15 years they were here, they've paid no tax at all claiming they had made no money. I assure you, we're not making money. What a liar. People say it's hard to tax corporations because they'll move somewhere else. How's Starbucks gonna move somewhere else? People in Oxford Street aren't gonna just drift off to Holland every time they fancy a skinny frapo-coconut-puccini are they? Corporations, especially in Britain and America think that their only responsibility is to their shareholders. To maximize profits. That's why Cadburys was sold off to Kraft. Cadburys. Their creme eggs are shit now. The battle for ownership of the British chocolate maker Cadbury could be over. A British name for almost 200 years the firm looks set to be taken over by the American food giant, Kraft. Cadbury was founded by Quakers and built a community as well as a factory. It was an idea about people and places meadows and machinery. All paradox, it seemed at the time. The business grew and now the factory and a garden is the biggest cocoa and chocolate factory in the world. [uplifting classic music] [chuckling] The atmosphere then was brilliant. 20,000 trying to get into so many canteens. Canteens, yeah. Midday break. The big punctuation mark in the day. We used to sit on long benches that we'd have to climb over. - The food was lovely. - Yeah. And if you started at 6 o'clock in the morning you'd have a free breakfast, have what you like. Pat and meself, we've been in a, what we call a Cadbury house. It's a Bournville Trust house. We've been here 40 odd years now. Although I retired, like, 20 years ago I'm still in a Cadbury house. We've all got a company pension, and we're all smiling. So you surround the 80 acres of factory with 120 acres of gardens and playing fields. Swimming pools, cricket, tennis.. Darts, bowls, everything. It was great! They were sending us off to university. Some of them went to Manchester University - I went to Cambridge. - You went to Cambridge, yeah. You were the brainy one amongst us. I didn't know that. As a company to work for it would have been difficult to fault them. We was looked after. - We had the best times. - Best years of our lives. By far. During the takeover Kraft promised no one would lose their jobs. As soon as they owned it, they broke their promise. The food giant Kraft has confirmed it will close a Cadbury plant in Bristol. Kraft said it was unrealistic to save the factory and it will shut by 2011 with the loss of 400 jobs. We have a choice. We can have corporations like Cadbury. Or we can have corporations like Apple. Look at their factory in China. People killing themselves, people working 70 hours a week people sleeping on the production line. It doesn't have to be like this. We have to punish corporations that do this. The interest of the workers and the community needs to be as important as the shareholders. Growing up in Grays, I inevitably supported West Ham United. [shouting] It was my inheritance, like my eyebrows or drug addiction. But football is being commodified like everything else. It's being sold off like everything else. Teams in the Premier League are being bought up by billionaires. Look, if you can bear it, at Manchester United. It was bought by the Glazers in 2005 but they bought it with borrowed money and then they loaded that debt onto the club. So all the money the fans pay for tickets goes to pay off the 60 million pound a year interest on the debt. The Glazers have made a billion quid out of those fans. And the holding company that owns United is based in the Cayman Islands. So Britain's biggest club became a tax exile with 100 of millions of pounds of debt based in the Cayman Islands and owned by Americans and they don't even pay the living wage as if we didn't have enough reasons to hate them. It doesn't have to be like this! Football doesn't need to be sold off to billionaires. Look at Germany, there the fans own the clubs. Like at Bayern Munich, where the fans own 75% of the shares in a non-profit making trust. They're just as successful. I would like.. The rules need to be changed for football clubs and businesses. ...employee and consumer representatives. [crowd clapping] Here in Britain, we like to think of parliament as the home of democracy stretching back into the mists of time immemorial, but it simply isn't true. This building was only knocked up in 1840. It's a Victorian replica of what they thought a parliament should look like. It's fake. When parliament started, it was just a bunch of aristocrats squabbling amongst themselves. - Order! Order! - I haven't finished! Order! When this place was built the vast majority of people were excluded from voting. It wasn't until 1918, that all men over 21 and women over 30 had the right to vote. And people weren't given the vote. It took direct action to win votes. People were massacred at Peterloo. Emily Davison died when she threw herself under the king's horse at the Derby. Just sitting at home, voting once every 5 years ain't gonna change nothing! You have to organize. You have to protest. Like these people, protesting against something called TTIP. TTIP is the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership and it's basically a big, secret deal being cooked up behind closed doors between, on the one hand the European Commission and on the other hand the US government. They want to get rid of all of the rules, the standards the regulations that... that control things like environmental goods food safety rules, labor standards, worker's rights. I've got an ideological plan. One of the things you'd see is, you're already seeing is that the NHS has been opened up to private providers. So people like Virgin are now operating frontline NHS services. Virgin? They can't even do their trains. - For example ... - They crashed their spaceship. So what TTIP would mean is that you wouldn't be able to get it back into public hands when you've seen that Virgin can't do it. You won't be able to bring it back into public hands in the future because it's tied up within a trade deal. A silent revolution is taking place. Big transnational corporations get to sue our governments for loss of profits. Not in our courts, but in secret courts which they have set up for that purpose. And that's the biggest threat that sense of a direct challenge to democracy. It is a revolution. To change forever the way our country is run. So, like, for example, Philip Morris, the big tobacco company is suing the Australian government for requiring it to... to market all of its tobacco all of its cigarettes in plain packaging because it is saying, you are gonna infringe our right to maximize profits in the future. So they're suing them for billions of dollars and that is exactly what we will face under TTIP if it goes through. It sounds literally evil. - It is evil. - Why is this happening? Well.. we are letting it happen. Protest works. When they tried to bring in these same powers before we fought back and we defeated them. [explosion] [people screaming] One last bank scandal. HSBC is one of the biggest banks in the world. In 2010, the British tax collector HMRC was given information leaks from HSBC in Switzerland. It gave the names of thousands of people who have been hiding money in secret Swiss Bank accounts. - Hello. - Hello. More than a thousand of them were avoiding paying tax in Britain. Yeah, I've just got to get 'round the other side. This bit's still part of the public thing. The information also showed that HSBC had knowingly helped people evade tax. That's illegal. The boss of HSBC, at the time, was Stephen Green. Even though HMRC knew that his bank had been breaking the law in 2010, he was made a Lord and a trade minister in the government. "...Mighty God that I would be faithful.." You know when you were in charge of HSBC? No comment. Your bankers were helping people dodge tax. Why did you let them do that? 'Cause I think I've explained, uh, I'm not prepared to make any comments on HSBC's business past or present. But you sort of have to, because at the time you were on millions of pounds and yet the taxpayer was missing out because of things that you were allowing to happen. How can you defend that? Sorry, I'm not prepared to make any comment on HSBC. Talk to HSBC, I'm sorry. The current head of HSBC is Stuart Gulliver. I'd like to put on the record an apology.. The leaked file show that he was hiding 5 million pounds in a Swiss account and that wasn't enough for him. He got paid through a Panamanian company even though he lives in Britain and his tax domicile is Hong Kong. I just need to talk to Stuart Gulliver about whether it's fair that he earns 4 million a year when hundreds of billions of taxpayers money... Unfortunately, I can't answer that. You'll have to take it outside. - Can I go over that bit? - No, you can't. Unfortunately, you can't. Sorry, mate. Alright. That's alright. I'll wait here, see if he's around. - He's not around. - He must be up there working. Four million a year, he's probably grafting. We've got another update. In there, I was asking about Stuart Gulliver's 4 million salary, but HSBC has just announced that last year he earned 7.6 million so it's almost impossible to keep up with these bank bosses and their incessant pay rises. What I'm saying now is probably redundant. Just imagine the biggest number you can then give it to Stuart Gulliver. Is it fair that like looters got collectively 1800 years but no bankers got any custodial sentences? That's nothing I can answer, mate. You'll have to come outside with me if you want to talk. Um, It clearly was unacceptable. We very much regret, um, this and it has damaged HSBC's reputation. Yeah, I think it's this way. No, you... you're not going anywhere Yeah, I think it's in this way, mate. No, you're not going anywhere. As dear, beautiful morally unimpeachable Che Guevara said "Those who do not dream will never see their dreams come true." Sadly I think it's also a lyric of that song "Talky Talky Happy Talk" but I'm pretty sure Che was first and certain that if the creators of the song quibbled he would shoot them with a Kalashnikov without knocking the ash off his cigar. I think of the millions of people going out to work wiping the ice off the windscreen on a winter's morning. Raising their children as well as they can working as hard as they can doing it for a better future. To make a good life for them and their families. Oh, really? By creating a financially complex capitalism we create a massive inequality of power. Free market fundamentalism pretends that the market is something universal something natural which works for everyone. When in fact, the free market is rigged for the rich and the powerful. They say, if the rich get richer, we all benefit. The wealth will trickle down. It ain't trickling. They say that competition always makes us more efficient, it doesn't. Cooperation is often better. [train chugging] Now obviously, long-term, we want to live in a non-hierarchal utopian collective where everyone's equal and we live in a blissed out transcendent world of white wonder. I don't mean the color white I mean the transcendent light that connects all consciousness. But for now, we could make a few basic concrete changes so next time we are out on the street, we're not just saying, "Oh, everything's rubbish" we have a clear few ideas let's make a bit of a start, shall we? How about, now hold on to your hats, we make them bankers pay back that money we gave 'em. How about a financial transaction tax to stop all them gamblers in the city. How about a 90% income tax for the richest 1% of people? What? Uh, that would include me. Let's, we... we don't have to rush that one through. That's complicated. 90% inheritance tax for anything over one million quid. My kids are fucked, if they're ever born probably be idiots anyway, nah, they'll be plucky. Stop tax avoidance. Stop avoiding it! Everybody equal under the law. These things aren't controversial but they're not happening now. How about a living wage for everyone? That should be about what, 15 quid in London for them poor sods trekking about on night busses mopping up pubs, 300 years to earn a year of their boss' money. Could we possibly break up billionaires' monopolies of the press so you don't have one liver spot covered tarantula man running the entire media? No one should be able to own more than 49% of one newspaper. How about we change company law so companies like Apple can't say, "Oh, we have to avoid taxes "it's the law to not contribute to society. "It's the law that we base our business in a tiny island that's got no people on it." All companies should have workers consumers and members of the community represented on the board so they can be part of the conversation. All workers should have shares in the companies they work for. Bosses' pay and worker's pay should be related and decided upon by a cross-section of workers in the company. We need to give people the time and space to come together in communities in shared enterprises. Change does happen, and it can happen quickly. 35 years ago, we had a revolution, secretly for the richest 1%. Now all we need is a revolution for everyone else. [instrumental music] In the US, we have 94 trillion dollars of wealth. 94 trillion! And of that, 25 trillion is unused. Whoo! I need to talk to Stuart Gulliver. Please? Please? I got a current account. In very simple terms, what needs to happen is banking needs to go back into the past where banking was a boring business. It was predictable. It was transparent. [knocking] Hello. They won't let you in this side because.. They've shut up the whole thing because I'm trying to get in there to talk to Stuart Gulliver about his 4 million annual salary. Do you know what Libor is? Yes, I know what Libor is. What is it? Libor? I don't have anything to do with it. [Russell laughing] You'll reach our banking that's the boring side of the banking. > Now you're getting shafted. They won't let you in the office. Switch off the profit margin in banking. The bankers will walk away and do something else. Boring banking, exciting businesses. Kiss me, Brand! Love you, darling. - Muah. - Muah. [cheering] Root vegetables. [kids laughing] We're taxing too many poorer households and too many middle-income households we're not taxing wealth. Some people have so much, some people have nothing. Well, I feel my personal view we should have a loving, peaceful protest. [indistinct chatter] [instrumental music] I would argue, uh, what the situation we're seeing today is one of those moments in history, right for change. [blowing whistle] ...the right for proper overtime. I've just popped down here and am staying overnight. Just some sleeping bags and blankets and stuff. Good afternoon. [indistinct chatter] Leave our homes alone! This is about people trying to get on and show more compassion if it ends in a karate kick, it's the wrong message. Actually, today we have some good news. The New Era estate campaign against Westbrook has been victorious. Westbrook have decided to sell the estate to a housing association facility. This is a result, not of anything except people power. People coming together to confront lazy governments. [crowd cheering] Feeling bloody great, it's amazing, isn't it? [audience applauding] Well, thank you.
