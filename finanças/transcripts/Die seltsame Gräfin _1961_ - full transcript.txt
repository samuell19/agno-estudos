Hello? -ls Miss Margaret Reedle there, please? Who is there, please? - Hello? Miss Reedle? This will be your last quiet night. What is this all about? Miss Reedle, you can't change it. Tomorrow, the day after tomorrow... Tell me who you are! - You'll see, or maybe you won't... Who was it? - Some man who knows my name. What do you think he's after? He's probably some nut who calls women at night in order to scare them. Margaret, breakfast is ready. Special delivery for you. - I think it's from the Countess. She writes to inform me that she would be more than pleased... to have me as her private secretary and... she will be happy to welcome me on the 17th of the month, etc. Ah, I'm so happy - And I must look for a new roommate. The last one I had used to snore. I'll leave you with your problems. Oh, Margaret, I envy you. Just think of... all the important people you'll come in contact with. Maybe you'll marry... into money. Prince marries model! I'll be able to say I know you. Let it ring. Maybe it's important. Yes, hello? - Finally! It's the same voice, the same man. Hello, listen! Why don't you answer, Miss Reedle? Your time is almost... What does that guy want from me? - He's a lunatic, don't listen to him. Hello, Miss Reedle, did you understand? You're lost! Very soon, maybe today! He's starting to get on my nerves. - Don't get excited, forget it! Don't answer it! - What did he say? I'm lost! You'll live in a castle while I slave away in that old tea room. Yes well, so long until tonight. - Bye Margaret. Look out! Are you all crazy here? Someone must have loosened the rope. What's the matter up there? Well now, that was too close. Thank you. - May I help you? My name is, Michael Dorn. Lets go! Good morning! Morning! - Mr. Saddle asked for you. Come in! I'm sorry for being late, Mr. Shaddle. - Oh, it's alright. And now, Miss Reedle, I want you to go to Telsbury for me. Yes? Shaddle! At 4 o'clock? One moment! Yes, that will do, that will be fine. What's the matter? Don't you feel well? - I'm alright, Mr. Shaddle. Please, sit down. - No, thanks. I'm alright. But if you don't feel well? - No, no I'm sure I can drive. Take the car and contact the administration of the prison. Have the convict Mary Pinder sign this statement, please. Oh, another thing, Miss Reedle. You are leaving on Monday? - Yes. If I paid the same salary you'll be getting from the Countess, would you consent to stay on here? Mr. Shaddle... - Then you've made up your mind? Yes, I arrive on the 17th. - I was just asking. Thank you, good luck. This will be your last job for us. You won't want to accompany me this time. I'm going to a prison. A prison, well I don't know. Which one? Telsbury, woman's prison. - Telsbury? Miss Reedle, get out of the car, quick! Hurry up! Miss Reedle, what for heaven's sake happened? Are you hurt? I think you should call the police! The police? But the scandal! And Miss Reedle wasn't injured. Take you hands off me. I can walk by myself. I'll teach you to run away! I'm in trouble with Dr. Tappatt because of you! Doctor, I made it! I blew her up. Lock him in his room till he calms down. - No, no, don't lock me in! The doctor has to dismiss me. I've proved I'm sane. I'm sane. Doctor! I had to prove I'm sane. I had to... I must find out... I must find out if she's dead. She must be, must be... Leave me alone with him. Pinder! Pinder, the Director wants you. I have the impression you dislike coming here. Today is the last time. I'm leaving my job at Mr. Shaddle's office. Mrs Pinder, may I introduce Miss Reedle, secretary to Mr. Shaddle. She's here with the documents needed to release you. Pardon, what was your name? Reedle, Margaret Reedle. Margaret Loais Reedle? Yes, but how do you know my name? Mr. Shaddle, mentioned your name. He told me you'd come with the papers. Please. Here, please! Thank you. I hope we'll meet again. - Mrs. Pinder, this means... that you are free to leave at any time. Goodbye, Miss Reedle. Goodbye. Why is that woman here? - Mary Pinder is a poisoner. Poisoner? Incredible! Yes, incredible. She had even been sentenced to death. But she was pregnant and therefore could not be hanged. She doesn't look like a poisoner. If you're interested in the case, Mr. Shaddle still has the documents. Something wrong? - Yes and no. That woman gave the impression she felt sorry for me. Home? - Please, Mr. Dorn. Call me Mike. Like all my friends. Yes, Mike! Well, goodnight Margaret. May I see you again? Why? Of course. Then I'll call you. Who was that handsome creature? Where did you meet him? What's wrong? - It's been a terrible day. I just want to forget all about it. What's that? Candy. All it says is: For Miss Reedle from an ardent admirer. But how did it get here? - No idea. I found it when I came in. Somebody probably threw it through the window? Hello? - Hello, is that you, Miss Reedle? That man again? - No, it was a wrong number! It was him, I heard his voice. - Don't get so excited. I have to know if Miss Reedle is alive! Hello it's me: the voice! Is she dead? I have to know. I have to... - I'll show you try to escape! I can't bear it, something terrible is going to happen to me. I can feel it coming. - At Carterfield Castle you'll be safe. Yes, perhaps you' right. - I'll have the telephone tapped. And if I get a hold of him, I'll personally ring his neck! What's the matter, Margaret? - Somebody was here. Don't be foolish - A man next to my bed, I wasn't dreaming. Who could it have been? - It was Mike Dorn. I'm sure of it. Who is Mike Dorn? - The man who brought me home tonight. I saw his face only for a moment. - You're so worked up and nervous, your starting to imagine things. - But it was him. If only I knew what it all meant. - Now, think about it. He sends you candy and then in the middle of the night, he sneaks in here? Lizzy! The candies are gone! - Where did you leave them? Right there! Prussic acid, hydocyanic acid. Enough to poison 10 people. Thank you. - I don't envy you at all, Mike. Good morning, Mr. Shaddle! Selwyn dear, come down here, you can hardly expect to meet our guests... when you are suspended in mid air. Miss Reedle? - Yes! Good morning. Morning. - Countess Moron. This is my son Selwyn behind you. Very pleased to meet you. My mother has a good taste when it comes to her staff. Addams, bring the drinks. Mr. Chesney Praye, Miss Reedle, my new secretary who is beginning today. Mr. Praye is my financial advisor. And Mr. Shaddle is my lawyer. Take the ladder away. Please sit down. That boy! But after all he's very clever. He wants to be an electrician. Experimenting all day long. When do you start to work, Miss Reedle? On next Friday morning. We only came over today for a visit. What's the matter Selwyn? Please sit down. - Thank you mother. Were you an actress? No. - I though so. Your manner and your voice. Miss Reedle said she is not an actress. - But I would like to be an actor, mother. "In such a night as this when the sweet wind has gently kissed the trees... and they did make no noise, in such a night" Oh Selwyn! Miss Reedle will get a bad impression. You know very well... you will never go on the stage. - Lorenzo doesn't... suit you very well. - My grandfather used to say... Addams, my butler. He has been with me for a great many years. A very grateful servant. And now Addams, will you please show Miss Reedle where her room is? Very well, my Lady. Come this way. - Just imagine, Chesney. Mr. Shaddle tried to convince Miss Reedle at the last moment not to come. I always considered him a gentleman. - Something I never could claim about you. Everybody is so very complementary. Please! Here you are. Hello! My name is Margaret Reedle. - I'm Felicitas. She calls me Mary. A quirk of hers, I guess. Have you met the butler yet? The butler, yes. - How do you like him? I don't know yet. - Sticks his nose into everything. How could the countess hire such an ugly person. Have you noticed his hands yet? No. The countess is president of an organization that supports ex-convicts. Do you mean he is an ex-con? - Naturally. You can tell the type. Here, Mr. Shaddle, have a chocolate. In the meantime I'll buy you a nice wreath. A bad joke! - Joke? These were meant to cause... Miss Reedle instant death by poison. - Quiet, she's in the next room. Did you say that these were poisoned? - Yes! Impossible! - True! Who? - Who? I thought you'd tell me that! [V e? Yes! you! But why? - In the last 24 hours there have been... 3 attempts at murdering Miss Reedle. I won't be able to guarantee her safety, unless you tell me all you know. - I have no further information. After all, you're the one ordering me to protect this girl, which means that... you know that she's in great danger. Tell me who is threatening her! If I knew I wouldn't have hired you. Mr. Shaddle, why did you dismiss her? - She wanted to work for Countess Moron. And so the Countess employed her. - If she gets a chance to work for her. "The only person to appear on behave of the accused Mary Pinder, was her neighbour, Mrs. Reedle." My mother a witness for the defense? Evening, Miss Reedle. Still hard at work? Mike, I want you to explain something. Why were you in my room last night? What do you mean? - Mike, I know it was you. I am very grateful for all you've done for me but I don't understand it. Who knows maybe it will happen again? - Mike let's be serious! Why did you take that box of chocolates? Margaret, I can't explain right now but please trust in me. And promise... to lock all your doors and windows. Yes, wherever you are! When are you going to move over to Countess Moron'? On Friday. Thank you, Margaret, goodbye! - I don't understand. Who is it? ls there anyone there? What do you want? Hello, Miss Reedle. I must speak to you at once. It's very important. But I have to see you in person, as soon as possible. Yes, but I can't go out at midnight. I just can't. But tomorrow might be too late! Listen, you joker, why don't you come over here if it's that important. You insult me. - Why? Cause you don't trust me. No one should see us together. Where are you? - I'm not far from your house. In Jefferson park. I'll be waiting at the sundial. Lizzy! - Thank God, it's you! You nearly frightened me half to death. And what's happened to your clothes? I was almost run down by a car. - Who was it? I don't know. - Listen. I saw him! You saw the driver? - No the man on the telephone. I can't stand it. I can't stand it any longer. I've got to get out of here. Tomorrow, I'll move over to the Countess. - Yes, I think that's a very good idea. Why must this happen to me, Lizzy? Tell me why. I haven't done any harm. The file on Mary Pinder. Wait, here's something. Listen. "The death sentence imposed on Mary Pinder has been reduced... because she's been found to be pregnant. The baby, Margaret Loais, has been adopted by the witness Mrs Reedle." Mrs. Reedle? But she's your mother, isn't she? Of course, don't you see? Margaret Loais. Mrs. Reedle only adopted me. The daughter of a murderess? How awful! No, I can't, nor won't believe it! Chesney Praye, a British citizen, born June 10th 1908, South Hampton. For fraud, sentenced to 11 months prison. Repeater. Falsification of documents, 4 years of hard labor for bigamy. And this isn't all in my opinion. What does he do? I'd like to know that, too, Inspector. Frequents Carterfield Castle. It's very strange. The mail, my Lady. Will you sign please? - Certainly. I wish to dictate another letter, now. Yes, of course. - To the address, to the director of the omen’s prison at Telsbury. Dear Director Duff on. I have today... received the list of candidates for whom you wish me... to find a position through my organization. In the first time, they are given food and clothing by our organization Humanitas. The name of the 4 women to be released are the following: Audrey Miller, Ann Hurley... Why don't you go on writing? Oh, I'm sorry.. - Audrey Miller, Ann Hurley. Hurley is spelt H-u-r-I-e-y. Elisabeth Wright and Mary Pinder. We will be expecting to hear from you. Don't you feel well? - Pardon, my Lady, the last name? Mary Pinder. What is it, my dear? You can always tell me. It's alright, thank you. - Then we'll continue. As far Mary Pinder is concerned, I would like to do something special... because of her excellent record there. I'm willing, comma, as I have done with Addams, my butler, to offer her a position here as my housekeeper. Paragraph. Selwyn, where are you off to, now? Theater, mother: Hamlet. - Without my permission? "To be or not to be that is the question, whether it is nobler in the mind, to suffer the slings or arrows... " - Now stop that Selwyn. Dr. Tappatt told you, that you should take care of your health. He's no more the medical doctor than I am. Besides he's a crazy drunken fool. - You are my obedient son, aren't you? Now, go up to your room and play with your experiments! Excuse me, Miss Reedle, that you had to witness this scene. But as soon as he starts talking about theater... You shouldn't talk like that, mother! - Excuse me, my Lady. I can't fulfill all of your wishes. I'm trying following Dr. Tappatt's instructions concerning your health. Selwyn! - Not now, I've sent him to his room. You look marvelous tonight, charming! - Please no compliments. Nevertheless, thank you! Addams, I hope I can rely on you. I don't want him to leave tonight. Very well, my Lady. Lizzy! How sweet of you to come. Let's go up to my room. I've a lot to tell you. It's very nice here. - Very kind of the Countess... to let me visit on your first night. A beautiful evening and 2 beautiful women. May I introduce you? Lord Moron, my friend Lizzy Smith. Welcome to Caterfield. May I show the ladies the gallery of my ancestors? No, thank you! - Yes, please! Pardon me, should I call you your Lordship, or your majesty, or... How charming. No, just Selly. - Selly? That's what my friends call me. - Your very kind but... I'd appreciate it really. The history of the Moron family dates back... to the 14th century. Here you see the Russian Princess Daschkow, married to my grandfather. My grandfather used to say... Oh, maybe that's not for the ears of young ladies. This is the Earl of Moron, my father, who died in India. What a handsome man. - Do you really think so? It's William, my fathers uncle. If the ladies like to inspect our collection of weapons? Yes! - No. We have much to talk about. Yes, I understand. Now, perhaps another time? Yes. - A pleasant evening to both of you. "When shall we three meet again, in thunder lightening... or in rain..." Macbeth Act 1. Here we are. It's beautiful! I'm so happy for you. What was that? - Just the door. Come, sit down - Lets hear it. Guess what. You won't believe it. The Countess is hiring my mother... as a housekeeper. I can't believe it. My mother and I here in the same house and I don't even know her! Can you imagine how I feel? - Yes, but does the Countess know? I haven't told her yet! I don't believe my mother's a murderer. You should see her. Did that man phone again? - Since you've been away, no more calls. I'm so glad it's all over. Of course it's over. Forget all about it. This is what I've always dreamed about. Living in a beautiful castle, like a fairy princess. It's all so romantic. What a beautiful night... Hold on. Margaret, Margaret! The balcony's collapsed underneath her. Miss Reedle almost went down. - What? Someone should have warned her! She was able to hang on until the butler pulled her up. This is terrible. My poor child, how could this have happened? The balcony was unsafe, my Lady. - I know. That's why the door... was locked, and the key kept hidden safely away. Someone put the key back. I wonder who it was? Who are you? - Miss Smith, Miss Reedle's visiting friend. - Where were you at the time? Mother, I heard the noise and ran up. Someone put the key in the door. I want to know who it was and why! Who? You, Mary? Addams? - He came to my rescue, just in time. And what were you doing on this floor at this time of night? If it hadn't been for him, I would have been killed. Yes, that's true. - It was probably through him... that you were in danger my dear. Addams! Did you put the key back in the lock? - No, my Lady! There's more behind it! Miss Reedle, I don't want you to stay in this room. You'll be kind enough to give her yours? My room? Yes of course. - Your friend can stay the night... if she likes. - Well, I don't know. If Margaret wants me to. I'd like to point out... What? I can't tell you how sorry I am. It's all very frightening for me. There's no one here who I can trust. You must stay with me. I'm afraid. - Afraid? Promise you'll lock all the doors and windows wherever you may be. What did you say'? That's what Mike said to me yesterday. Help me! - In front of the door? Yes. - Were you asleep? Who's there? - Please, open. Sorry, I forgot something. - It's the young Lord. What have you forgotten? - Can't I come in? We were just going to bed. If you tell me what it is, maybe... No. And don't worry if I seem... to be a little odd. And above all, don't tell the Countess. Goodnight. What did he want? - I don't know. Is there something I can do? - No, no thank you so much. Come over here, and sit next to me. I'm awfully nervous and scared - But Leonore, you can trust me. Yes, I know, but Selwyn. Don't worry about Selwyn! - We have to, he knows more he... What was that? A shot? Did you hear that? This is a weird place. Where's Miss Reedle? We have to talk! - She's asleep. Lizzy, do you know who's voice that is? Mike Dorn's. - Here, in the middle of the night? Margaret, you're too nervous! - He's here and he wants to talk to me. A loudspeaker. That's why the Lord was so anxious. He must have forgotten to turn it off. Help me. I've got to see Mike. Please, come with me. - No, I'll stay here and guard the room. Hush, no noise. I'm so glad that you're here, Mike. - I didn't think there could be so... many accidents. And after the candies... - Poisoned candies? Yes, that is why I searched your room. You must leave here immediately. But I promised the Countess I'd stay. And she intends... to look after my mother. - Your mother? I'll tell you a secret, Leonore, that will calm you down. The doctor has developed a method... ln spite of that, you have to leave here. What would she do with a dead girl? Who wants to see me dead? And why, Mike? - If I knew... What are you doing my dear, why don't you put a light on. I thought I heard voices. - Voices? That's impossible. What's the matter? Well, your hands are trembling. Perhaps you should see the doctor. Should I call him? - No, it's alright. I'm just confused. - Of course, I understand. Go back to your room and try to get some sleep. You'll feel much better in the morning. Good, you're back. - Spoke with Mike, and he wants me to leave. - Very reasonable. The voices have gone. Who can that be? Hello, Miss Reedle, how do you like it at Caterfield? You're very fortunate. You'll be very happy there. At least you should be for a while. Hello, why don't you answer. You can't escape this time. I'll find you. I can't take any more of this. I just can't stand it. I can't! My Lady, Margaret is having hysterics. - What has happened to her? A nervous breakdown. - I've already called a doctor. Mr. Praye, where's the patient? - Upstairs. I hope you can help her. Doctor, come quickly, please. Now, what is it? - She almost fell off the balcony. She also said she heard voices. - Voices? Are you sure she heard voices? Human voices. - I told her it was all in her mind. And I'm told you also tried to take a jump. No, she just walked out onto the balcony... The voices, did they order you to jump? There, sleep is the most important thing. Sleep and rest... and forget the voices. You'll stay the night, Doctor, won't you? I will stay here. Morning! - Morning! Mr. Shaddle does not wish to be disturbed! Mr. Shaddle! Miss Reedle almost fell off a balcony last night. This was no coincidence. It was attempted murder. I have made some very interesting discoveries about the Morons. The family has no secrets from me, Mike. - Now, is that true, Mr. Shaddle? I have made a very interesting discovery. I was very surprised to find that the family fortune is in the Lord's name. Yes, I know. - Did you also know that... the legitimate heir was his uncle William who disappeared and is presumed dead? I have no idea what this is all about. I've been the family lawyer for years. I'd say that I know the Morons very well. Anyway I've told Miss Reedle to leave, she's not safe there. I can understand you wanting to look out for her, but your feelings are showing. Mr. Shaddle. Why don't you tell me the truth? Your going to leave? Then pack and go over to my room. Yes, I'll go and tell the countess. - You going to leave? I'm not spending another night here! - It is a mysterious house. One might say it's haunted. I'm sorry, Miss Reedle. How are you? - Better this morning. By the way, did you sleep well in my room? Or did something disturb you? - Disturb us? No, nothing disturbed us. Glad to hear it. You don't mind if I see you out? Come in! Miss Reedle, how nice! How do you feel, my child? Let me look at you. Sit down! Thank you. My Lady, I wished to be relieved of my position as your secretary. Do you want to leave? - Yes. I'd like to leave today. But you mustn't, I have to have someone. Here, I can trust! Don't you see I need you very much. You're kind. I did look forward to it. Pleas, stay. You can't leave me alone. Around here, there is no one I can trust. Not even my own family. Yes, it's true. You mustn't leave me here alone. We must stay together. You will stay, won't you, my dear? You are a dear sweet thoughtful girl. What's wrong with him? He's dead! Selwyn, get out. I don't want you to see this. What was Addams doing in here? Nigel, very tempting. But what if the police show up? - Why? I'll sign the death certificate. Mrs. Pinder, I was sent to pick you up by Mr. Shaddle. Margaret, what's the matter? - The butler is dead! I think, Lord Selwyn's experiments had something to do with it. I had to get away. - Don't forget we're busy. I'll be with you in a minute. Sit down. Margaret, tell me all that's happened. - Lizzy. Excuse me for a moment. You are Miss Reedle? Would you come with me, please. Police! There must be a mistake. - No, there is no mistake. I accuse you of the attempted murder of John Addams. You accuse me of what? You must be out of your mind! - Do you think so? What's that? Are you sure? Is she here? Just a minute. Come back immediately! Do not leave the building! Come back or you'll be sorry! The doctor is busy at the moment. - Which doctor'? Please, wait in here. Inspector, I have to talk to Miss Reedle. - It's alright with me. Well, then, can I see her? - If you like. "If I like", where is she? - No idea. We released her an hour ago. Released her? - One moment. Your on a special assignment. Alright. But why did you arrest Reedle? You know, she had nothing to do with it. He was trying to steal... the Countesses jewels from that boobie trap in the library. Yes. But do you know who that butler was? - Who? Oliver Frank, officer. One of my best men. I got him... the job at the Countesses. I have a suspicion that those jewels... are the same ones that disappeared 20 years ago, during the Pinder murder case. Chelsea police station. Chief Inspector Lighton. No, my Lady, Miss Reedle left some time ago on her way to see you. I will guarantee that you will pay for what you have done to her! What do you want? Let me go. Why was I brought here, anyway? This is an insane asylum? Get away. Let me out! Please, help me! What was that? Didn't you hear it? - Pardon? -I've heard nothing. Come, my dear! Who lives here? - A good friend of the Countess. Don't you worry, you'll be safe. One moment, Miss Reedle. Please, where am I? What is it? - You fool! Miss Reedle is here! Oh, my head! - Miss Reedle, please come. Hello my dear child, how are you? Much more relaxed, I hope. The Countess wishes you to look after her. She didn't say anything to me. - Just for a few days. She's worried... about you and wants the Doctor to take care. We'll take very good care of you. - No, no, I'm alright. Just relax. You'll have a lovely room. Plenty of sleep, deep, healthy sleep. Unbutton your blouse, please. Mrs Rooks, show Miss Reedle to no.4. And she's not to be disturbed. Come with me. - And I wish you a speedy recovery. What do you want from me? You want to kill me! Where's Mrs. Pinder'? - She's in the violent ward. The 2 women are not to meet. - Don't worry, they won't meet. And if something goes wrong? - What can go wrong? If it does, then there is going to be trouble. Did I make myself clear? They're driving me crazy with their noise. The countess asks you to come up. What a surprise! As my grandfather used to... Pardon, my Lord, where's Margaret? - Miss Reedle? She just ran away. - I'm afraid something horrible happened! Mr. Dorn, so glad to see you. Please, come in. No, thanks! I like to talk to Miss Reedle. - You should apologise for calling... so late. But I will look at it in view of our mutual concern. Where is she? - I'm afraid she isn't too well. Poor child. I'm so worried but you are going to help her. Yes, I intend to. Miss Reedle told me great things about you. It pleases me to know that you will be protecting this lonely child. You will have a seat, won't you? - My Lady, are you sure you have... no idea where Miss Reedle is located now? - I'm sorry, no. The poor little darling. She was so happy, too. She was so sweet to have here. Charming and trustworthy. I would be desolated if something happened. Mr. Dorn please find her. That is exactly what I do not intend to do! But I don't understand. - You understand perfectly, and I don't believe a word you said. I'll find out where she's hidden, with or without your help! - You've nerve to speak to me... in such manner. - There are many things I'll dare, in order to get her back safe and sound. - What gives you the right... to come into my home and make this insinuations? Insinuations'? What do you mean, my Lady? I have nothing else to say. Please leave. Yes, hello? Dr. Tappatt. My Lady, I just wanted to tell you the girl is here and everything is fine. I'm so glad you called, Doctor. I was so terribly worried about the girl. Thank you! This is Lord Selwyn, he wants to help us. Did the countess give you any information? No, but she is at a certain Dr. Tappatt's. - The Gallow Sanatorium! Let me come with you, I know where it is. - Thanks you, but I'll find it by myself. But you can do something else for me. Don't let anyone phone from the castle. If I'm not back before midnight, please call the Chief. Inspector, you don't trust me? My grandfather would... - See you later! See you later! I wish to speak to the doctor. - He isn't here. And if you want my advice, keep you mouth shut. Why are you locking me in? - For your own protection. How do I get to the Gallow Sanatorium? - Straight ahead, then turn left. Pretty bad road. Who? With a London license plate, here. Thanks very much, Sammy! Who is that next door. It's her, let me go in and see her. You told me if I killed her, I'd be released. Please, let me go to see her. You told me, do it and you'll feel better. Dr. Tappatt, you promised to let me out. That's enough. Downstairs! And not another word! - But I have to see her. And how are you now? What and no appetite? Doctor, why did that woman lock me in? - Did she? She's probably afraid for you. - Who was that man who was watching me? Man, what man? - I've seen that terrible face before! What are you talking about? Did you hear some more voices? Did you... think you fell off another balcony? - Please, let me out! Come with me! Lets go downstairs! No, no! Down those stairs! Better do what I say, Miss Reedle! Come on! Down you go! Come on, now! Come on! In you go, now! You stay here! No noise! I'll see to our visitor. I knew you'd be coming back. How beautiful. You can sleep in my little bed. Put your hands up! Good evening. - What do you want? Where is Miss Reedle? - Miss Reedle? Who that? Lets go into your office and talk. I'm Michael Dorn, Inspector Dorn. Is that so? Lets go in. - After you! As you wish. I look for Miss Reedle and her mother. - In my sanatorium? There must be some mistake, I've never heard of these 2 women. Do you have a search warrant? - I'm on a special mission. Go ahead and look. Maybe I'm hiding somebody. Here! Or there! What's out, there? - Alright. At the present time, I don't have one patient. You'll have to look for your women somewhere else. I'll stay around, if you don't mind. - If you wish. Make yourself comfortable. Whiskey? - Thank you! Chin up! You're very distrustful, I see. Cheers! - Cheers! I may be your guest for some time, Doctor. At least till you produce these 2 women. I give you my word, my friend. Your very distrustful, Detective. Do you, for example, suspect me of putting something in your drink? I suspect. Cheers! You can't fool me. You were told I was coming. So you had the women hidden. Pure fantasy, Inspector! Out in the yard is the car in which you tried to kill Mrs. Pinder... Miss Reedle, the other evening. - Can you prove it? It's the same car that picked Mrs. Pinder up at the jail the other day. Pardon? What was that you said just now? Repeat it! Repeat it one more time if you can. Repeat it! I wonder if Inspector Dorn has found her? In my case they used another very dirty trick. The family wanted to get hold of my apartment houses and so they placed me... under a guardian, to stand only on the evidence of this doctor. Believe me, I'm completely normal. "Two roses on a branch, halli, hello. Blooms to the heavens, halli, hello." What? Inspector Dorn was here? Do you think he will come back? He hasn't left. - What do you mean? He's cell no. 4 with a bad headache. - What's this all about, and will you do? His car is parked outside, we'll put him in it... and drive him to the quarry. It's easy to miss... a bad turn at night. I want to take Miss Reedle away tonight. Where? - Go and get her! Up here? - Yes, of course. And right away! Just keep calm. Miss Reedle, I wanted to... - I will see to my patients downstairs. Please, sit down. Take me away from here, please! - Yes. Under certain conditions, of course. Conditions? - Yes. What conditions? - Now listen, my dear. I can get you and your mother out of here. - My mother? Where's my mother? Here. - She's here? You and your mother will be freed at once, if you marry me. Marry? You? - Everything is ready, except for a few details. You'll be a rich woman, as will your mother. Please, believe me, Miss Reedle, I had nothing to do... with the terrible things that happened. No! My mother isn't here! Oh? One moment. Bring Mrs. Pinder here. - I will explain all, when you become my wife. - I can't marry you, Mr. Praye! In that case, I'm sorry, Miss Reedle, you will not live to see the morning. Margaret! My name is Praye. I'm your daughter's friend, Mrs. Pinder. Can you help us? - Yes if your daughter has agreed... to my terms. Please leave us alone now. Just for a few moments, Mrs. Pinder. Have I been speaking the truth? - Let me see her! Will you grant my wishes on this matter? I have to think. - All you have to do is sign to this. I don't want to. - You'd rather die with your mother? Is that what you want? Perhaps you should listen to reason. Wrong Mr. Praye, put your hands up. - But I think you're making a mistake. You'll have your chance to talk later. Keep you hands up! I have nothing to do with this all. - Who else was interested in getting... rid of Miss Reedle and her mother? Who? tell me! Wait here, I'll be back. At last! Come with me, hurry! - My mother! She's in Tappatt's car! Hurry up and let those poor devils out of the cellar! Mary Pinder, it's you? You are indeed welcome to Carterfield. You look confused. But tomorrow, when everything has been explained, you will understand. Who are you? - Leonore Moron. You know me, I can tell! You know who I am, and the name also. You were married to my brother William, weren't you? Secretly without permission! You were put in jail. And we both know why! I however am going to do my best to help. I don't need your help, Countess! - You do! A woman who has been convicted, sent to jail! A murderess! I really want to help you! Please, have a seat. These are the points I want you to note. Let me have the papers, please. A free voyage to South America, and a pension. You can put in your own sum. A house and a beautiful garden. And jewels. - Thank you. I'm not going there! Your not going? - No. Do you think you can get rid of me that easily? Just like 20 years ago? No my Lady! I'll remain here with my girl, and find out who the real murderer was. The real murderer? - Yes. For whom I served 20 years for. You knew very well that I have nothing at all to do with the murder... or the jewel robbery! Do you know who the real murderer is? I know her name if that's what you mean. - You're sick, you've been alone too much. You don't know what your talking! - It's the Countess Leonore Moron! You are the guilty one! What are you talking about? You're crazy! And your accomplice was the doctor. And only for the money. My husband and the jewels owner both stabbed... with the same poisoned needle. But I had no proof. So I was send to prison for 20 years. A good way to keep me quiet. But there was still my daughter. And you thought you might find out. So you tried to silence her. Your turn, Countess. Prison! Prison? Along with him! Don't interrupt. Do continue, Mrs Pinder, it's very interesting. Margaret, take this gun, stay here and keep out of the way. Get up! Hands up! Don't try it or I'll... I do you've killed him! Miss Reedle, I'm so glad to see you again. How are you? Why are you all looking at me like that? What's the matter? Even you, Selwyn! And you, Miss Reedle, tried to kill me! Me, a benefactor of mankind! I have never harmed anyone! I'm a good woman! May I help you to your room? - Do not touch me, for I'm the Countess! Nobody!
