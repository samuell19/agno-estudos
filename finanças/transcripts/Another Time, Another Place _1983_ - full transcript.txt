Just reddin’ it up, for the Italians. DOUGAL: Italians? Prisoners of war. DOUGAL: I thought prisoners stayed at the camp. Not these three. They are staying in the bothy. Why you? What about the other wives? Are they refusing to do it? I’m next door, and the other wives have got bairns. Oh, here. Aye. It’s easy, not hard work. Just getting their messages from the van, things like that. It’ll be a bit extra for you. Aye, it will. (RAIN PATTERING) (SPEAKING IN ITALIAN) (BIRDS CHIRPING) (TRACTOR RUMBLING) (WHISTLING) JANIE: That’s them started now. MEG: Oh, aye. Is that Finlay with them? KIRSTY: Hey, seeing as it’s the grocer's van tonight, do you think he’ll let us off ten minutes early? (MEG SCOFFS) You’ve got hope. (GRUNTING) KIRSTY: Good God, look at that. -Excuse me, sir-- -What the hell is going on here? Excuse me, sir. My hands is broken. I want it for my fingers... gloves. Ah. They don’t have the knack. And Finlay doesn’t seem to be giving it to them either. That’ll give him a few grey hairs. Learn him who his workers are. (CONTINUES WHISTLING) KIRSTY: There’s more thistles than corn this year. JANIE: Aye. I’m scratched all over. (MEG SCREAMING) Beel! Beel! -JANIE: Hey! -(BEEL LAUGHING) You nearly had us in that fence! Don’t worry, Kirsty, the fence will hold you. We mended it last week. If Finlay saw you coming up there without warning, burnin’ up the tires. Finlay says when you see Jess at the grocer’s van, you’re to tell her he’s expecting her out at the mill on Friday. KIRSTY: He’s good, I hope. Jess has refused point blank to set foot in a field with those Italians. You can just tell Finlay that. I’ll tell Jess. MEG: Jess is well out of it. KIRSTY: I hardly ever see him these days. (KNOCK AT DOOR) (INDISTINCT CHATTER IN ITALIAN) (SPEAKING IN ITALIAN) Buonasera, signorina. Buonasera. Hello. Hello. (SPEAKING IN ITALIAN) Oh, no. No, no.

Just you try that, and you’ll blow the whole bloody contraption up and yourself along with it. (MEN LAUGHING) (MEN CONTINUE TO LAUGH) (MUSIC PLAYING ON THE RADIO) (DOOR OPENS) -Hey. -Hello. You never came for your dinner today. (SIGHS) I couldn’t move to go anywhere today. First time’s always the worst. You’ll be all right in the morning. What do you mean, "I’ll be all right in the morning"? I’m never going back to that threshing mill. You wouldn’t care if I was on my knees and lifting horse’s dung, so long as it gave you a penny in your pocket. I’m not worried whether you go back to the mill or, not. It’s just that Jess'll not be going back. She got word today, Donald was killed at Monte Cassino. Where are you going? To the barn. There’s a heifer on the point of calving. We’re in for a long night of it. I’ll be along later. Aye, well. Mind you bring the tilley with you. (DOG BARKING) JANIE: That’s a good lass. DOUGAL: Just... (DOUGAL GRUNTS) JANIE: That’s it.

That’s, four and eleven. UMBERTO: Signora. Signora. GROCER: Have you got everything now? Better see what your friend is wanting. What was it you were wanting? Io? Pig. I like pig, please. Pig? Well, well, well. So, you would like pig? You’ll have to go a long way for that. We’ve stopped keeping pigs. It’s bacon he wants. Where’s his coupons, then? As far as I’m aware, the prisoners do not have coupons. Their coupons are kept at the camp. But, he can have some of mine. There’s no law against that. There’s a law against it in France. A woman can get shot for less than that over there. (INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING) Grazie, signora. Grazie. Signora. Why, you are all angry? Because her man was killed in Monte Cassino. But, Italy no fight in Monte Cassino. I know. I’m sorry. I’m very sorry,signora. (SONG PLAYING ON RADIO) -Right? -Right. (MUSIC STOPS) Right, then. Mill money, tattie money, harvest money, and Italian money. Nobody got as much as me. Nobody worked that hard. Isn’t that right? See, the Italians make all the difference. Isn’t that right? Hmm? Oh, aye. That’s right. Now, settle yourself. You’ll put me off my counting. We could get new curtains, like the ones Kirsty got out of her catalogue. There’s nothing wrong with the curtains we’ve got. I’m more in need of planks for the hen house. Well, cockerels, then. We could buy some six weeks old, and sell them to the butcher’s van for Christmas. Hmm. It’s pretty late for that now, though. Bikes, then. -Bikes? -Two second-hand bikes. What are we in need of bikes for, when we’ve always got the milk lorry? Only once a month. And, only as far as the town. (SCOFFS) Bikes. But, there’s other days, and other places. (SINGING IN ITALIAN) Even the prisoners have bikes. Aye, they have that. They don’t have to buy them themselves. (SINGING IN ITALIAN) (SLOW INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING) Here. Come on. (COW MOOING) (COW MOOING) (PAIL CLANKING) MEG: Ella? I’ve told you before, and I’m not telling you again, Keep away from that Italian. (TRACTOR THUMPING) Another letter for you. From Rome. My wife.

Tatties, nips. Wind and the rain. Bloody wind. (SPEAKING IN ITALIAN) In Naples, much sun. Is different. You, wait. You see, on the hill when the heather comes. When? September.

She’s all dolled up for planting tatties. We all know what that’s for, you know. MEG: Uh-huh. Signora. Hey, you! What about that slot? No tatties here? Where the hell do you think you’re going? Get back and finish off. I no understand. If it was a woman, you’d bloody soon understand. Who is this girl? Servant. -Farm servant. -Hmm. Bella. (HOLLERING) That’ll be the postie with my new catalogue. Hey! Where are you off to now? (SPEAKING IN ITALIAN) Possible letter for me! (PAOLO SPEAKING IN ITALIAN) FINLAY: Come back!

But, is possible, one more time? You and me? Maybe. One time. (BIRDS CHIRPING) (DISTANT CHEERING AND SHOUTING) (SHOUTING IN ITALIAN) War finished! War finished! (CHANTING IN ITALIAN) What’s she wanting? Kirsty! I thought I’d just give you the nod. The mistress is on the go, collecting for yon foreign missions. She’s on the road up the shepherd’s. She’ll be down here in no time. I’m not in need of no nod. The King himself, is welcome to come into my house any time he likes, if he’s that way minded. (SPEAKING IN ITALIAN) You are beautiful. You like present? Yes? (SPEAKING IN ITALIAN) Take. (SPEAKING IN ITALIAN) Mmm. It’s nice. Good? Everybody go wood. We go? Yes? We go? You like go wood with me? Go! There’s no need to go to the wood with that one. You could get her up against the barn door. My man, got that same lady with one of the lorry drivers. God, did he get a right shake. There was nothing but, her big, bare thighs. It was just disgusting. (SLOW INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING) (GIRL GIGGLING) Janie, is possible? No. No, it’s not possible. Here? Now, my husband, he may come. Yes, Janie, one more time is possible. Yes. Yes? Where? Where? When? Soon, war finished. I go home. When we see, Janie? On the hill. On the hill. Okay. Luigi! Yes?

For always. Sempre, Luigi. Si, certo, siempre. Certo. In Napoli, you’ll get other girls. Ragazzas. No. I love you. I’ll not see you again. One day, you come in Naples. Soon. I’ll never get away from here. You, go through the wood, that way. Okay. Okay. I can’t get a word of sense out of her. All she can say, is she had on pink knickers. (CRYING) Its one of those buggers of Italians. I didn’t get a look at him. Aye, with the height the Italians are at, it wouldn’t surprise me. She was always very thick with that Luigi one. Oh, look at my good stockings. -All ripped. -Here, come on, now. Here. Here, here. Else, was it Luigi? Who the hell is Luigi? Here! Where about Luigi? Luigi? Where is Luigi? -Go to camp. -Bugger all that! I saw him making his way up to the woods. (SINGING IN ITALIAN) (SPEAKING IN ITALIAN) (ELSE CONTINUES CRYING) (VEHICLE APPROACHING) (SLOW MUSIC PLAYING) Poor bugger. It’ll be a long time before he sees that Napoli of his again. Oh, by the way, now that we’ve lost the Italians, why don’t you take a turn up the hill to Jess? See, if she’ll give us a hand tomorrow. Else. Else. Else, what happened to Luigi at the court today? What happened to Luigi? Well, I’m not sure. They had a whole jing-bang of them stood there. What way could I identify them? All that Italians looked the same to me. I’m not finished yet, though. They’re still investigating. (MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO) Why are you turning the wireless off? I was listening to that. (SWITCHES IT BACK ON) (SONG PLAYING) Your supper’ll be cold. Are you not wanting your supper? I’m not hungry. Did you mind to get a mantle for the tilley at the grocer’s? I’m saying, did you mind to get a mantle for the tilley? Oh, God, no. I forgot. It beats me where your mind is these days. What do you think will happen to Luigi? What do you think? Dougal? Do you think they’ll send him to jail? God knows. What’s more, I’m not really caring. (SIGHS) I’m only thankful to be rid of them lot. Maybe, I’ll get a bit more attention now. (INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING) Was that what brought you here? I thought I’d tell you. In case Luigi mightn’t tell you. You realize, you will be called as a witness? My dear, young woman, what you’ve just told me, obviously completely alters this particular case. But, unfortunately, what you appear not to be aware of, is that it does not alter the fact that he will be charged. You see, either way, he is guilty of... ...association with a civilian female. And that, is a military offence. Oh, God. Oh, by the way, have you had a word with Jess yet? About helping us out? Not yet. Huh. Well, if you’re going that way... (SLOW INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING) Jess. Jess, Finlay was wondering... What was Finlay wondering? (DOOR CREAKS) Jess, Finlay was wondering... now that the Itali-- (CRYING) Luigi is gone. It was nae him, Jess. Luigi was with me. You’d better come on in. You’d better come away inside. (MUSIC CONTINUES)
