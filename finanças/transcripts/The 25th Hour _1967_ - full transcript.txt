Let me through! They can't do it without me! I'm the godfather. Let me through, please. Uh! Let me through. Godfather. I'm the godfather. Excuse me. Our father who art in Heaven, hallowed be thy name.. Ghitza, you're late. - Why are you late? - I'll tell you about it later. - Give me the baby. - Thy will be done on Earth.. Easy. Give us this day our daily bread.. Suzanna. - I'm sorry to be late, Suzanna. - Shh. Quiet, Ghitza, you make too much noise. As we forgive them that trespass against us and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil. Amen. Give me the child. What does this child need? What does this child need? - Faith, hope and baptism. - Huh? Faith, hope and baptism. Faith, hope and baptism. Hiya! Aah! Whoa! Ho hup hup. Hup hup. Heyiep. - Suzanna. - Uh? - Come on. - Heh heh heh. Hey op op ho oh op. Lovely music! It makes babies happy. And cows gives more milk. Hopa hopa. Johann, let me explain to you about this morning. Explain what? Well, you know how happy I am to be a godfather. You only have one godfather. You know, you missed half the ceremony. Johann, I'm trying to tell you something. Give me a glass. Johann, I want to tell you something. What? Yesterday, George Damian got me a job, on his ship. - As a stoker. - Good. Well, in 27 days, I shall be in New York. - America? - Yes. I know, it doesn't look right. A godfather to leave the country the day after the baptism. But I-I won't stay long. I'll earn a great deal of money. I'll come back to Fontana. Buy myself some good land. - Hey, Johann. - What? You're not angry with me? Why should I be angry? My son will have a rich godfather. Give me a glass. What is the name of your ship? Why do you ask? Because tonight, I'm sure to dream about it. And I want to get her name right. - It's the Danou. - The Danou. To the Danou. You know, once I almost went to America. Yes? I took all my savings. A ticket for San Francisco. That night. God bless you, mother. Goodbye, father. My bags packed.. Well, why did you not go? I couldn't stop a woman from crying. So I married her instead. - You know what? - What? I am glad. See? * Hey hey hey * * A-a-ah * * Hey hey hey * * Hey hey hey ohh * * Hey hey hey * * Hey ** Suzanna. Hello, Mr. Trajan. Glad. Quite glad to meet you. This is an honor for our son. How could I miss such an event? That's for Anton, with our love. - Oh. - And for his father and mother. - Thank you. - Please, please, come in. Father, your son is here. - Hello, daughter. - Oh! - Trajan! - Father! My dear! - This is for you, mother. - Oh! What is it? Where's this famous baby of yours? Oh, he's inside. He loves to sleep. Like his father. Me? When do I sleep? You can sleep through anything. Me? Oh! He's awake. Oh.. Oh, Johann, turn it off, please. Just a moment, Johann. Why, father? Who is he? Adolf Hitler. What a voice! He could raise my dead horse. Heh heh. Shh. What is he talking about? The Germans have just invaded Czechoslovakia. Is that good for Fontana? No. No, it's no good for anyone. Oh! We will never stop him. We have to stop him. All of us. - But how? - Please, Nora. Are you writing another novel, Trajan? - No. - Why not? I don't think it's a time for fiction. There is a time for all the things a man should do. - That is scripture. - Exactly. The great storm is coming, father. Now is a time to-to report before it blows us all. You and me and Johann Moritz here. But are we so interesting? What can you call such a book? Title comes later, mama. You're so brilliant, my son. But there are only 24 hours in a day. Don't waste them. They have already been wasted. This is the 25th hour. I wonder who of us will survive it. Hello, Suzanna! Hasn't your husband finished building your house yet? Um. My husband can finish anything he starts, Dobresco. As you can see. And where is your fine stallion? At the flour mill. Grinding away, of course. Are you jealous? Ha ha. I don't have to be jealous of a peasant. I can get any woman I want. Hm. Except me. Look, Suzanna, when you were the prettiest girl in Fontana and I was the handsomest officer we had a few laughs together. Hm, why not? You were always funny, Dobresco. 'Ah, you're the prettiest mother' and I'm the police captain. Why not open the gate? What have you got to lose? Let me think now. I'd rather make two more bricks. Huh. Oh, come on, Suzanna. Don't be mean to me. Maybe you'll need me one day. When that day comes, Dobresco, I'll take the veil. Now, get off. If Yanni catches you, trying your tricks on me he'll split your head open. Ah! Let him try. I'm still the strong man in this village. Tell me, Suzanna, if Yanni wasn't coming back would you open up? Open up? For you? I never did before, why should I now? You're a married woman now. You're not afraid now as we can see. Now, clear off, Dobresco. You're not funny anymore. Answer me and I'll go. Just say yes or no. If you weren't expecting Yanni back, would you open the gate? If he were away for a few months, say? Why should Yanni go away for a few months? He might. Supposing he did, what then? Wait till the time comes, Dobresco, and try your luck. Who knows? I might get desperate. Yes, indeed! You might get very desperate. Goodbye, Suzanna darling. Go to the devil, Dobresco darling. Whoa! Oh! Suzanna! Suzanna! Why is this gate locked? Oh! It's locked? How did that happen? - Ah. - Uh. You look tired. It's hard work at the mill. Why are you so late? I went by the post office. There was a...postcard. From America. Oh, it's from Ghitza. He's in New York already? Look at that. Just look at that. "New York City." If it wasn't for me, you'd be there. Maybe, but then, what would I do without you? - Hm, hm-m-m. - Oh, you sill.. Oh, come on, Johann, the soup will get cold. Who needs soup? You do, hmm, or you'll get worn out. Worn out. Never, never, never. Johann Moritz, it's for you. - What is that? - Another requisition order. - Oh, let me see. - Oh, later. Let's eat. Ah. Mm. It's gonna be another hot day. The bricks will crack. Cover them. All. And wet them down good. I have to lose all morning just just because of this stupid paper. Johann, let me dress and come with you. What do you think this is? Sunday? You have work to do. Oh! This afternoon, we will break the bricks. Hey ya! Hey yaaa! Hey ah. Hey. Yahoo. Ha! Marcou! What-what are you doing? - Get back. - Hold it there. What, what's happening? I came to see Sergeant Dobresco. Just a moment. - You wait here. - Marcou, wha-what's happening? Sergeant, Johann Moritz is here. Let him wait. "I'm expediting to your command, Marcou Goldenberg, lawyer, 30 "and Johann Moritz, farmer, 44. "In accordance with the latest regulations under the act "for protection of the nation against Jews and undesirables. "Calling for the requisitioning and expediting to labor camps "of all the said Jews and undesirables "residing within this district. "Signed, Sergeant Nicolai Dobresco District Captain, Fontana." Sergeant. Hm? Moritz is not a Jew, sergeant. So? He's not an undesirable either, sergeant. Father Koruga thinks a lot of him. I am the law here. Not Father Koruga. And to me, Moritz is highly undesirable. Take the report quickly. Wait! W-w-wait! Wait! - I wanted to see Dobresco! - Oh! Oh! - Oh! - Look! You-you're making a mistake. I came to see Dobresco! You're-you're making a mistake. Marcou, Marcou, what-what am I doing here? What am I doing here? Well, with you it's, it's different. Why? Because I'm a Jew? Marcou, for you, it's an injustice, I agree. But for me it's a mistake, it's, it's a stupid mistake. The distinction escapes me. Marcou, please, please tell them, I am not a Jew. Look, Johann, we're living in a world where any human being can become a Jew at any moment. Attention all of you! Form columns and forward march! Marcou, Ma.. Hello, Suzanna! How are you today? Johann is still grinding at the mill? He isn't here, Nicolai. Going to let me in now? The gate is open, Nicolai. Stop, Suzanna. What are you doing? - 'You're crazy!' - Where is my Yanni? 'Yanni'll be back as soon we get the job done.' - Keep away from me! - Oh, Suzanna. Oh, stop it. You hear me. Stop it, my darling. Why should we fight? Your dirty police took him away. What do I have to do with it? I-I obey orders, that's all. You stupid pig! You bitch! I'm the law here. Don't try me too fast, Suzanna. I'm a man, you know. A man? You? You filthy, thieving drunken, stinking, gutter pig! I am a representative of the Romanian government. In my person, you've insulted the king of Romania. One of these days, you'll get down on your knees and beg me for forgiveness. Beg me! And I'll crush you like that. Like that! Calm! Halt! Attention! On your feet! You have now arrived at your destination. My name is Captain Apostol Constantin. And I'm your commanding officer. On the very spot you're standing now the king has ordered that the canal be dug. 'It will serve as a barrier against our hereditary enemy' 'the Russians, if they should attack our country.' The canal will extend from here to the Topolitsa river. Now I want you banana-noses to listen carefully. 'You're going to dig this canal with joy in your hearts.' 'Knowing that your labor's being expended in a worthy cause.' 'First, because it's for the defense of your country' 'and second, because you're all Jews.' 'And at last you'll be of some use to somebody.' But...I'm not a Jew. Now I want to give you all a word of advice. Each one of you is going to be given a certain quota of earth to dig everyday. And any man who doesn't dig his assigned quota is going to be accused of sabotage and court martialed as an enemy of the father land. Enough said! 'You will now unload the trucks.' 'Work on the canal will start tomorrow morning.' Mister! Officer! I'm not a Jew. Aren't you ashamed? What does he say? - I-- - Said, it's a mistake. A mistake? The king doesn't make mistakes. I'm sorry. This time he made one. You Jews always argue. Start unloading the trucks. Mister, who do I see about this stupid mistake? Anyone with a legitimate complaint can come and see me in my office. Where is your office? It hasn't been built yet, idiot. 'Oh, and don't come until it has.' Alright. - Sir! - Sir. - My boy. - What? What sort of behavior is this? Aren't you among your own people? What is there to hide? Look, I am not hiding anything. - You feel alright? - I'm alright. Hey! Listen, my boy. Before they catch you.. ...run, hide, deny. Say anything to get away. You are entitled. But once you are caught, what is there left but courage? What has courage got to do with the fact that I am not a Jew? A Jew who denies his people, cuts himself off from them. I'm not denying anything. If I were a Jew, I would say so. - Proudly. - That's better. But I am not a Jew. Please. You are beginning to upset me. I am a Christian. - 'He is a Christian.' - Baptized. A little drop of water cannot make a Christian out of a Jew. Excuse me, sir. Where is the minister's office, please? To the end of the hall and turn left. What is it? What you want? Your...Excellency. S-sir, I-I have come to see you. Come in. Come in. Please be seated, dear lady. What can I do for you? Hmm, it's about my husband, sir. Hmm. The mayor of our village and the country commissioner is saying.. ...only you can get him back. Now exactly, what is the problem, my dear lady? Well...it's just a silly mistake with the war ministry. O-oh-oh, I don't mean you make mistakes but.. ...someone who doesn't know I need him. Oh, please. Help me. - Help me. - Please, dear lady. Please. - What's his name? - 'Johann Moritz.' Johann Moritz. 'From Fontana.' From Fontana. 'Five months ago, Sergeant Dobresco' 'had him arrested for being a Jew.' 'And I swear to you, he's not.' And he is not. Look...here is the certificate signed by Father Koruga who baptized him. Please, Your Excellency. Let him come home again. We've got two little babies. Really? And you've kept your figure well. Very well. Thank you, Your Excellency. 'So, release Johann.. What was that name again?' Hmm...Moritz, Your Excellency. Johann Moritz. Johann Moritz. I tell you what, Mrs. Moritz I'm going to give your case my personal attention. Oh, thank you. Thank you, Your Excellency. Good morning, Your Excellency. 'Uh, Dimitri, bring me the morning papers, will you?' Right away, Your Excellency. Dear Suzanna.. This is the 11th letter I've written since I got to the camp and you still have not answered. I know writing is not easy. But please. This is very upsetting to me. In case you have not received my other ten letters there are some things I must repeat to you. For six months, we've been digging a canal to stop the Russian army. The camp commander is of course very busy. But as soon as he can see me, I will explain everything to him. And he will send me back to Fontana. Another thing. Before I left I bought some wood. It is all cut and paid for. It is very good Oakwood for the barn I want to build. And it costs a lot. Old Artimi will show you where I stacked it in the woods and he will help you carry it home. By the way, you will have to fix the well too before the rainy season starts or you will have trouble. And it will cave in. And if you are short of money Palta owes me 500...get it. I will be coming home quite sooner. Don't worry. Kiss Antone and Petra for me. Your loving husband, Yanni. You know where I found these letters? In the garbage. It is the 11th letter I have written to my wife. What was it doing in the garbage? Why don't you ask the commander? He's next door. Go on. 'Come in.' 'Well, go on.' Sir, it's about the-- I only listen to complaints on Monday. Get back to work. - But...sir-- - But what? But today is Monday. Oh, a troublemaker, eh? No, sir. But I-I found-- Ah, you know what we do with troublemakers around here? You want me to tell you? We put them on the garbage. I'm already on garbage. Sir.. Now listen to me, you.. Normally, I beat lousy troublemaking Jews into a sherry and serve them to the pigs. But, umm.. ...anger ruins my appetite. I don't want to let an imbecile like you spoil my wonderful gulag. Strul, give him a smell of our wonderful gulag. Smell it! No. You probably owe your life to this gulag. Thank the gulag. - Thank you, gulag. - Hmm. And while I'm in a good mood, what's bothering you? But make it short. Sir, this is the 11th letter I've written to my wife and I-- Short! Send me home. I'm not a Jew. - You're not a Jew? - No, sir. - You're not a Jew? - No, sir. Strul, he's not a Jew. Strul, get me the personal file. Well.. ...if you're not a Jew, what are you doing here then? Well, sir, that's what I don't know. - You see-- - Oh, you do not know. The war minister says you're Jewish. And you say he's wrong. - But there was a mistake. - Moritz Yankel, two children. Residents, village of Fontana. Wife's name, Suzanna. - That's you, isn't it? - Yes, sir, that's me. But my name is not Yankel. It's Johann. I swear by all the saints. I'm not a Jew. For five months you've been in Jewish camp and only now you tell me, why? But every Monday for five months I've been trying to tell you. Now watch what you're saying now. Yankel Moritz or Johann Moritz or whoever you are. Don't involve me. I've done 25 years service. And I'm not spoiling my record for a fool like you. I'm not a fool. And I'm not lying. Alright. Let's settle this matter once and for all. Get out. And close the door. Alright, what are you? Romanian. Orthodox. And you know how Jews are baptized? Well, I think so. And you're a Romanian orthodox Christian? Yes, sir. So you're not baptized the same way? No, sir. Alright, let's see if you're a Christian. Sir? Take down your trousers. How can I see if you're a Christian if you won't 'take down your trousers?' All the way. 'Stop blushing like a schoolgirl.' Do you think I like this? Do you think the king has put me in command of the Topolitsa just to...to do this? Strul? Is this man circumcised? - Maybe he can? - Maybe? - What's maybe? - He's right. What's maybe? Well, captain, it's doubtful case. - Strul! - Is he or isn't he? Well, captain, uh, whether a rabbi had anything to do with it or not, it's hard to say. In my opinion, it's an unprofessional job. Hmm, you see, it's not easy. Thank you, Strul. Well...I don't want to take sides in this matter. Write a statement. Sign it. And I'll send it through official channels. - Sergeant Dobresco. - Major Henkel. Will you come into my office? 'Suzanna Moritz.' 'We must speak to you.' 'In the name of the law.' Suzanna Moritz, we want to see you. She's mad. I told you. 'Suzanna, listen to me. The Germans are here.' 'We have to requisition all houses belonging to Jews.' 'If you don't sign the paper I've brought you' 'in a few days, you'll lose your house.' What's on the paper? 'It's nothing.' 'I want to help you, Suzanna.' 'It's just a little formality' 'requesting a divorce from Johann.' You lousy dog! Look at that. Just...look at that. When the war is over.. ...I'm going to bring my wife.. ...and my boys.. ...and show them the canal we built. Oh, they.. They will love it. My dear Yankel.. ...to work like a slave is nothing to be proud of. Believe me. I am no slave. What else are we? Prisoners. That's all. He's right. The only way you can ever go from here.. ...is if you escape. Otherwise they'll keep us here working until we drop. Tell me, Yankel. You want to escape? Why should I escape? Soon they will let me go. - Let you go! - You wait and see. 'Yankel Moritz.' Yankel Moritz. Report to the camp commander's office. Aha! Nice fella. Strong fellow. But what a schlemiel. I tell you, today's the day. - Where are you going? - The commander sent for me. - Go on. - Thank you, sir. * La la la la la la la la la * * La la la la la la la la la * Come in. Ah, Moritz. So, you still claim you're a Romanian orthodox and a good Christian? That's right, sir. Liar! Your wife has just divorced you because you're a Jew. Don't believe you. You don't believe me? Read this. I don't wanna read it. Is that true? Please yourself. Sign here. To prove you've been notified. 'Here.' Excuse me. May I...see that letter? So what do you say now? Well.. ...maybe I am a Jew. Maybe my grandfather or my.. ...my uncle or.. ...someone. Whether you're a Jew or not.. And I'm not commenting myself either way. But she's a woman. She wouldn't divorce me because of that. I'm...I'm still the same man. But you're not there and some other man is. Not Suzanna. She could not. Oh, she could. And she did. A woman is a woman. 'Yankel.' 'Yankel.' What? Strul told us a lot about your troubles. Is it true your wife left you? That is my business. - Eat. - Thank you. I'm sorry, Yankel. I know how you feel. You do? Tomorrow night, you're welcome to join us. Join you? An escape is being arranged. Escape? Where will I go? I've no home. First, away from here. Then, America. America...always America. - Are you with us? - If not, shut your mouth. Hmm. There are guards everywhere. Listen, Yankel.. ...a truck will pick us up at the main entrance. The rest you will find out. Well? Alright. Good. Then tomorrow night. Idiot. My whole future's in this suitcase. Shh, it's the commander. Of course, it's the commander. For what we're paying you don't get less. Hey...I can't pay. I'll pay for you. You help me. Get in already. For you, Yankel. Thank you. But where are we going? To Hungary. Budapest. Life is not so hard for the Jews there. Minister's aid will see you now. Sit down, father. The minister asked me to receive you for him. And to tell you this. Our country is now in a state of war. And we cannot tolerate interference by the priesthood.. ...into cases under our jurisdiction. Priests would do better to see to the spiritual needs of their parishes. Justice is spiritual too, my son. For more than a year, I've knocked on every door. The police, the army, the militia-- It is hardly a surprise you have gotten no satisfaction. These matters are classified "Top secret." But...it's been a year and a half since my husband was sent off to a camp for Jews. And he isn't even Jewish. My dear lady, you divorced your husband because he is Jewish. I have your request right here. It was signed under coercion. Don't add another injustice to this case, I beg you. Look, father. This man is a Jew and we have proof. Moritz has just escaped from a government camp with a group of Jews. That is tantamount to a confession. Out of respect for your age and position the minister has decided not to consider your behavior in this affair treasonable. Tell the minister.. ...that I will pray for all those to whom God has given a little power. May he teach them how to use it. Yankel. Doctor, I'm thirsty. Can I buy us something to drink? I have some...Romanian money. Shh. Can you believe it? Who could believe it? For God's sake, they send Romanians to concentration camps in this country. Keep moving. - Julius. - Isaac. Wonderful. Julius. 'Rosa..' My darling sister. Four days and four nights, we've been on the road. It was terrible. Terrible. But we stuck together and here we are. I want you to meet my dear friends. Aaron Strul. Please sit down. Israel Hurtig. And Yankel Moritz. Yankel. Come in please. Meet my family. Hello. Excuse me. Sit down, my friend, sit down. We were just about to start dinner. Let us drink to your first meal as free men. Oh, Yankel. Yankel, please sit down. Yes, sit down, sit down. Thank you. But please could.. Could I eat in the kitchen? As you like. - Juliska? - 'Yes, madam.' Look after Yankel. The kitchen is on the left. 'He's a simple fellow.' Come in. Excuse me. - In fact the lady-- - Sit down. I'm thirsty. Where are you from? I-I come from.. Are you Hungarian? Yes. Why? Uh...is it true that Hungarians.. ...and Romanians are enemies? Ask the government. They decide those things. I am a Romanian. So? 'Juliska..' '...serve the chicken.' What are Romanians like? Like anybody else. They have wives.. ...homes.. ...children. Sometimes they lose it.. ...like anybody else. Mm. Are we far from the waterfront? The waterfront? You mean the river? No, the port. The-the sea. But there is no sea in Hungary. There is no sea? How do we get to America? What time is it? 2.30. In the afternoon. What? 'You've been asleep for 17 hours.' Why didn't you.. Why didn't you wake me? Oh, you were so tired. 'Thank you, again.' 'Hope some day we meet you happy.' 'It's a pleasure to help.' 'I know from the thought you formed.' 'I hope we shall see you again.' Hurtig. Happy journey. Good luck, Strul. 'Good luck.' They, uh.. They left. Yankel. 'Come in, Yankel.' 'Come in.' Sit down. Yankel. I have some important matters to discuss with you. Yes. This morning, I went to see the Jewish state committee of Budapest. 'They fix the papers for America, and they..' - 'They--' - You got them? Yankel.. ...your case is very, very difficult What did they say? I begged them. They can't do it. They just can't. The Jewish aid committee only takes care of Jews. And Yankel.. '...you-you are just not a Jew.' No, I'm not a Jew. But I have been a Jew for year and a half. Why can't I be a Jew now? Ah, that was different. With goyim, you can be a Jew. But with Jews, you're no Jew. I see. I understand. Doctor, thank you.. Thank you for trying, anyway. I've tried, Yankel. I've tried every way. But.. ...thousands of Jews are being murdered killed, butchered. So the committee can only take care of its own people. Of course, of course. Maybe there's a committee for, uh.. For Christians. Maybe. But I wouldn't have their address. Oh. Oh, thank you. Yankel, wait a minute. Look, Yankel.. ...I haven't got any spare cash but I want you to have this. Oh, no, no, doctor, please. - Take it. - No, I-I.. Take it, sell it. You'll need money after I leave. I shall miss you, Yankel. Is, uh...is Switzerland far? For a hunted man.. ...no place is far enough. You are a free man, Yankel. 'Free.' Good luck, Yankel. Good luck. Good luck. Hey. Papers? - I already gave the-- - Identification card. - I have no card. - Arrest him! Mister.. Mister, I-I just came.. I came to say goodbye to.. Please.. Please let.. today. Where did you get this? I told you. It was given to me. It's Russian gold. I.. I don't know. Why were you sent to Hungary.. ...with Russian gold? I was not sent. Stand up! You state here that you are driven to the frontier by a Romanian captain and you don't know his name? No, sir. I mean.. I mean, that's uh.. Your lying! It was Major Tanase Yvonne of the Romanian secret service. We know he operates in that sector. 'We know he's sending agents into Hungary every month.' Now, why did he send you? What's your mission? Oh, mister, I have no mission. Now, look.. ...don't you realize how.. ...stupid your story is? Huh? Alright, listen, listen, listen. You were in a labor camp for Jews 17 months. That's right. It's a lie. It has to be. You are Romanian, not a Jew! That's right, I-I'm not a Jew. At last, you admit something. Put him on the list.. ...of Hungarian volunteers.. ...for Germany. It's nice being on a train. What are you so happy about? You like being sold? Huh, I'm just enjoying the journey. Where do you come from? I'm Romanian. Exactly. And you, friend? Czechoslovakia. - You? - Pol from Warsaw. And you? I'm a Greek. I shouldn't be here. Any Hungarians here? - No. - No. You see? We stand in for them. Understand now? I still say it is better than walking. Everybody out! Everybody out! 'Follow the soldiers.' Follow the soldiers. You're now going to pick flowers. You will display these flowers at the windows when you return to the train. Right? 'Now, start picking.' Everybody back to the train! Move, go on, hurry! Look at them. They're political's. They give them a harder time than they give us. Poor bastards. - Mr. Trajan! - Shut up! Mr. Trajan! Johan Moritz from Fontana! Shut up! Are you crazy? But he's a friend of mine. You want to be taken to a concentration camp? Why is he arrested? He's a-he's a writer. Because he can write the truth. Johann. Johann! I keep forgetting my name is Johann. Tonight, I'm going to escape. You want to come? I escaped once.. ...and look where it got me. With two, it's a lot easier. We'll go to France. - Another country? - Yes. I've had enough countries. But you-you want to fight. You are the enemy of the Germans or not? Quiet there, Moritz. No talking during working hours! You know that perfectly well, you lousy Hungarian! I don't like Hungarians. You're all the same. Lousy workers. All you want to do is to talk about women. The one on this machine before you. 'He was a Hungarian.' 'You know what happened to him?' 'He got ten years of sabotage.' I am a Romanian. 'Romanian, Hungarian, what difference?' 'You foreigners make me sick.' 'Lousy, yellow maggot. Look at you.' 'A real Mongolian bastard.' Who is this man? Just another filthy Mongolian, colonel. Stand up straight. Open the mouth. Wider. Sergeant! You're imbecile. This man is not Hungarian. - Yes, sir. - That's right. Please close the mouth. Come with me. Attention! Gentlemen, I will, for you benefit give you a very interesting demonstration. I saw this man five minutes ago. I've never seen him before, correct? Correct, sir. We have not exchanged a word? No, sir. Nevertheless.. ...I'm able to give you inconsiderable detail his biography.. ...and history of his family for the last 400 years. My observations are based on purely scientific thought. Under national socialism.. ...we're at least a 100 years ahead in racial thinking. Strip off. Sit down, by the way. 'Strip off.' Now.. ...judging by this man's cranial formation.. ...by the type and modelling of the frontal.. ...and nasal bone structure. By the skeletal type.. ...especially the thorax.. ...and the clavicles. What am I able to deduce? I would draw your attention, gentlemen to number 13-C on your chart. A Germanic, obscure minority group.. ...coming from The Rhine Valley.. Luxembourg, Transylvania.. ...and.. ...Australia. There are 30 more sub-families in this group.. ...to be found in China.. ...and in the United States. Statistics are not available as they were only discovered a few months before the war. In the work I'm now preparing 'under the orders of Dr. Rosenberg..' ...I have called this group "The heroic family." It has a maximum.. ...of 800 members.. ...of absolutely racially pure Germanic stock. Their ancestors.. ...migrated from South-West Germany.. ...between the years 1500 and 1600. And this man, gentlemen.. This man.. ...belongs to the heroic family. Excuse me, mister. You know my family? Better than you know it yourself, my boy. Oh, yes? You may get dressed. Thank you. Now, I ask you, gentlemen. What was the historic cause.. ...that had the affect of making.. ...this man's ancestors over a period of three to four hundred years.. ...breed exclusively with women of their own race? When all around there were other women.. ...many of them, no doubt.. ...most attractive. Well, gentlemen, there we have it. The instinct for racial purity. It was the biological urge for purity of blood.. ...that prevented these people from pernicious inter-breeding. And here is the result. Gentlemen, rise. Look. The hair.. ...strong but silky. - Sit down. - Thank you. Even more silky than in our principal Germanic groups. Experts can identify it in a matter of seconds. The root, the same. Forehead, eyes, nose, chin exactly as in our 16th century engravings. And now, gentlemen.. ...for the conclusion of my demonstration.. ...I am going to tell you exactly where this man comes from. Listen carefully. Are you from the Rhinlandet? - No, sir, I-- - Correct. - Transylvania? - Transylvania. That's right. And your home is.. - ...Timisoara. - No. - Berghof? - No, sir. - The Szekler country? - That's right, mister. Fontana. But, colonel.. What is it, Captain Von Horst? ...but this man is dark. His hair, his skin.. ...his eyes.. ...alldark. Did not our remote Aryan forbearers emerge from a mystical darkness of India? Captain Von Horst? Any more questions? Good. Captain Von Horst? I want photographs of this man in SS uniform. Complete sets will be sent to Dr. Goebbels and Dr. Rosenberg and one to every newspaper and magazine in Europe. Yes, colonel. Gentlemen.. ...you may please salute. No, not me.. ...him. A rare specimen.. ...who must be preserved. Johann Moritz.. ...the first exhibit in the first human zoo in history! I have the honor to be its founder. Joseph? Joseph? Joseph? Hey. Who is it? 'It's me.' You don't recognize me? Johann Moritz. Jean. Jean? Where did you get the fancy dress? Oh, that, uh, that officer, he gave it to me. He said he knew my family. 'What are you doing here?' They caught me again, the bastards. Ah! 'But...that's alright.' It won't be long now. They are losing the war. They're on the run at Stalingrad. 'Back to the barracks, on the double.' 'One, two, one, two.' 'One, two, one, two.' I'll bring you food and cigarettes tomorrow. One, two, one, two. - One, two, one, two. - One, two, one, two, one.. Joseph? I keep forgetting I'm not a prisoner. Oh look.. Sergeant Dobresco.. ...remember me? Oh, Marcou Goldenberg. I'm so happy to see you again. So am I. Let's go. I swear all I did was call a war at the people's court. - I'll decide about that. - That's all I ever did. Shut your mouth! And march! Father, what's happened? Let's go inside. Father, do you want a cup of coffee? No, thank you, thank you. It's Johann. He's alive! Oh! Oh, look, Petre. Antono. Anto, look, this is.. ...this is papi. Papi! Oh! My child. He's wearing the uniform of the SS. He's joined the Germans. But he's alive, father. I am so happy. Oh, I wish that you could hear of Trajan. Trajan. Maybe, maybe he's with the Germans too. Maybe he and Johann are-- Trajan would never join the enemy. But, Johann has no enemies. He never had. He has now, my dear. You and the children must leave here immediately. Take only what you need, and hurry. Hurry, I beg you. Yes, father. I'd like to hide you in my house but it's just too dangerous. First thing the Partisans are doing is to arrest priests and collaborators. What are you going to do, father? Will you run away? My only parish is here. Johann. - Good news. - What? We heard last night the Americans are 15 miles away-- No talking! Keep moving. Everybody out. Take cover. What fireworks. The Americans. No, they're British. I tell you, they're Americans. British! What do you think, Johann? Makes no difference to me. I am down here. As soon as it lands up, we're running. You are always escaping. - Don't you like your guard? - Very much. That's why we want you to come with us. Why should I? I'm fine. You won't be, when the Allies get here. Who are they? British, Russians, French. None of them will like you. Not even the Americans. Americans? I've been trying to get to America all my life. Who is going to believe you with that uniform? Everybody into the truck! Into the truck. Into the truck. Get into the truck! I said, get into the truck! Stand back. - Stand back! - Don't. 'Get in everybody.' Quick, before they find the bodies. Get in now. Get in. I'll drive. We're escaped prisoners. Thanks to him. He's stole the uniform. He got us through the German lines. Marvelous. Lieutenant. Lieutenant, get those men over to the clothing office right away, will you? And take good care of them. Now, will you come with me, please? That's alright. You stay here. Go with them. After. You come. We're back with the Germans. Look, maybe the same camp, but it's changed owners. 'Attention, all prisoners.' 'Colonel Greenfield, your commanding officer' 'welcomes you to the center' 'and wishes to inform you' 'that you will all be treated 'according to the Geneva Convention.' 'The staff will do its best' 'to make your stay here pleasant' 'and comfortable.' 'No disturbances however will be tolerated.' 'I repeat, no disturbances will be tolerated.' 'You will now assemble by groups of 100' 'in front of each barrack' 'and await further orders.' 'You were not told to enter the barrack.' 'You were told to assemble in front' 'and await further orders.' Mr. Trajan! Johann. How did you get here? I'm Romanian. Romania was allied with the enemy that makes me an enemy. Oh! 'You may now enter your barrack.' Come. Maybe they have forgotten about us. I've written 64 petitions to the camp commander. One for each week been here. If I don't get a reaction soon, I'm going to deliver.. ...the 65th personally. Mail. - Kasut Nicholas. - Yeah. - Holderline Edwick. - Yeah. - Emrady Yanus. - Yeah. - Debesco.. - Yeah. - Keller Hoot. - 'Yeah.' 'Johann Moritz.' 'Report to the camp commander's office.' Hurry, maybe something's happening at last. - Koruga Trajan. - Oh. Name? Johann Moritz. Sir, for 19 months-- Do you spell Moritz with a Z or a TZ? All depends, sir. In Romania, with a Z in Germany, with a TZ. 'That'll be all.' - 'Thank you.' - No, sir. You see, I want to explain to you you see, there was a mistake, you see-- Listen, buster. The captain said that's all. Next! That is all you.. ...wanted to see me about? - Name? - Rudolph Mann. One N or two? Two Ns. Hmm. Two Ns. What did they want? They wanted to know how to spell my name. From Fontana.. They know you're here? The Red Cross sent it. How's your family? My father's in prison. They closed the church. My mother is dead. Your wife? Nora was Jewish. Johann. Suzanna is alive. Your boys too. They've left Fontana. Where did they go? Nobody knows. Mr. Trajan? Mr. Trajan? Haven't you slept? Will you do something for me? Of course. Look after my glasses. But you can't see without them. I don't want to see anymore, I've seen enough. - Mr. Trajan. - 'Shh!' Mr. Trajan.. ...there is always something good to look at. I've looked at the sky the sea, the mountains.. ...and men.. ...a few saints, but.. ...so many mad men. I've read thousands of books I've, I've written maybe a.. ...million words. It's enough. Mm, but that book you were going to write.. ...remember, the one we were all going to be in. My mother's last gift to me.. ...a title, "Twenty-Fifth Hour." That's it. Will...you write it? Johann.. ...the twenty-fifth hour is the last hour of all. I'm going out for a walk. Wait, wait, I-I'll come with you. No, no. I have to be alone for a while. Halt! Halt or I'll fire. 'Stop or I'll shoot to kill!' Halt! Halt! Come on! Let's go. I told you, I wanted no disturbances. Who the hell's responsible for this? Sir, one of the Polish kids. They're all kinda nervous. Put him on the guard house. Sir, uh.. ...he had this in his hand. Addressed to you. Well, this man wrote 64 petitions. Why wasn't I told about it? Well, colonel, we have 3000 prisoners in this camp. And every week, we get 3000 petitions. "The Heroic Family" by Colonel Miller 'condemned to life imprisonment for crimes against humanity.' "The Supremacy Of The Aryan Race" 'an article by Dr. Rosenberg, condemned to death.' "Race Superiority," a study by Dr. Otto von Bach 'director of the death camps, condemned to death.' "Tempo, Forward To Victory" "Das Illustrierte Blatt" "Berlina Illustrated Situm" finally, "Signal." There are, all together three thousand, seven hundred and twenty-eight publications. Describing this man as the archetype of the super man. 'His features have served as a model..' '...to inculcate in German youth' 'feelings of racial superiority, arrogance' 'and cruelty toward other people.' He has been a top model, you could say in the most sinister, malignant and vicious fashion in modern history. The Nazi Race Cult. To escape the fate of a Nazi concentration camp innocent people had to have his kind of blood. His head shape, his nose 'his bone structure.' 'Millions have died..' '...merely because they did not resemble him.' The Defense will no doubt try to minimize the role played by the accused in these events. You will be told, no doubt.. ...that the principal criminals have been punished. That Ribanchop, Rosenberg, Kaito, Yodel, Sauko.. ...have already, in this same court been sentenced to death. Yes, you have done justly to condemn to death the authors of this rile and atrocious tragedy. Now, I ask you to condemn it's actors as well. Only when all the criminals have paid their debt to it will humanity be able to bandage its wounds forget and begin to live again. Silence in court! The Defense has the floor. Your Honor, with your permission I would like to ask the defendant only one question. - Johann Moritz. - Yes, sir. 'Would you please take the stand.' Yes, sir. Thank you. Moritz, do you know why you are here in this dock today? Mister, for eight years, I haven't known why I was anywhere. Your Honor, Johann Moritz has summed up his situation simply, but completely. For eight years, he has not known why he was anywhere. I have nothing to ask for the acquittal of Johann Moritz. All I ask, is for clemency. And I make my plea, not in my own name nor in the name of a justice which is the right, the simple right of even the simplest men. No. I ask it.. I ask it in the name of Suzanna Moritz the defendant's wife. 'Sit down, Moritz.' I request the Court's permission to read a letter, which Suzanna Moritz recently sent to her husband. - 'It would be exhibit A.' - I never had a letter. Never. It was intercepted while you were at the prison here. I object to the public reading of the letter. Out of courtesy to our Soviet allies. I want to know what's in my letter! Mister, please, please, you read my letter. Quiet. Objection overruled. Sit down, Moritz. The Defense may proceed. "Dear, Johann "it has been eight years since we've heard from each other. "Thanks to Monsieur Pableci of the Swiss Red Cross "I found out where you were. "So much has happened since the police "took you away from Fontana. "I expected you back everyday. "I baked fresh bread each morning. "I left the door open. "I listened for your footsteps. "But you never came. "One day, the police made me sign a paper, divorcing you. "I signed it to keep our house. "But I never divorced you in my heart. "After we left Fontana, we walked a long way "and I got sick. "They looked after me in a little German village "but one night, some Russian soldiers came. '"We had locked the door, but they broke it down.' '"They took me and the landlady's daughter' '"away with them.' "They made us drink vodka.. "...then they tore off our clothes. '"I fainted.' "I am sick with shame as I write this.. "...dear Johann.. "...but I don't want to hide anything from you. "I didn't kill myself because of the children. "But ever since, I've felt as if I was dead. "As a result of that terrible time.. "...I have had another child. "He is now two years old. "I will understand if you never want to see me again. "But please.. "...please answer. Suzanna." Your Honor.. ...this woman is waiting. Your verdict must be her answer. I do not believe that the peace 'of this world will be much more disturbed' 'if this court decides to bring together again' 'a man and a woman who have already suffered so much' 'from a war which has been as criminal' 'as they have been innocent.' Hello, Suzanna. Well, you've.. ...you've not changed. You've not changed either. Oh.. Go, go and kiss your father, come on. Oh, Suzanna, they are men now. And men don't kiss. - Do they? - No, sir. Antono. Hey.. ...what's your name? Marcou. Marcou? Has the train come in yet? It just left. - Johann Moritz? - Yes, sir. I'm doing a series of articles on the defendants of the Nuremberg trial. I see you've found your little family again. - Well-- - May I ask what your plans are? "Plans?" We have no plans. Well, you don't mind if I take a few pictures, do you? Go stand over there beside your husband, lady. Come on, youngsters. One on the other side. You stand over here. That's right. Johann.. ...hold the little baby in your arms, huh? That's fine, that's great. Now, everybody, smile! Okay, move a little closer to your husband, lady. Uh, put your arm around her, Johann. 'Now, Johann...smile.' 'Smile.' 'A big, happy smile.' Now, the last one. 'Smile.' 'Keep smiling.' 'Keep smiling.' 'Keep smiling!' Come on, you can do better than that. A big, happy smile.
