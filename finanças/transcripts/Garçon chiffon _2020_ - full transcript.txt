Starting trip. In 50 meters, turn right. Turn right. I said, Turn right! Jérémie Meyer. The door is open. Thank you. Freedom is daring to talk AJA - Jealousy Anonymous I pass by a café and who do I see? My husband, sitting at a table. With the children and a girl. And the girl was really pretty. Sure enough, I bounced into the café and massacred the girl. I grabbed her by the hair, twisted her around and around, and literally wiped the floor with her. In the end, the poor woman, her face was so... So messed up that an ambulance was called for her. And my husband lost a contract 'cause they worked together. And it's the same, even at home with the kids. It's so bad none of them talk to me anymore. I pulled so many fits of jealousy, I was so spiteful, they couldn't take any more. I can't understand why the world doesn't revolve around me. That's good. Hello. My name's Louis. Coming up for one year since I wised up. Do you have any advice for Jérémie? Welcome first of all. Thank you. I'd say, learn to trust yourself again. And to trust other people again. That's partly why we're here. Above all, don't open every closet. You don't know what's in there. A killer. A slaughterer. Jeanne? Jeanne. 11 days since I wised up. When I start off, it's like a sore. Or eczema that goes red raw when I scratch it. And itches even more because I scratch it. It's absurd, wanting to know all Bastien does. All he does without me. My love. I went from anxiety to... anguish. It hurts. But I... I've changed since I come here. You work wonders, Gabrielle. Doesn't she? Jeanne. You're on edge. Imprecise. Here, you can tell all. You're safe. I do tell all. I don't think so. I don't get it. Help me, Gabrielle. Are you yourself faithful to your partner? No. Thank you, Jeanne. So, Jérémie, what brings you here? Yes, I'm jealous. But... Maybe that's not the whole story. My father died on January 14. The police found his body and called my mother, but they were separated so... My father had started over with another woman, Mireille. But they separated too. Some said his suicide was over her. Whatever. He was alone in his bungalow, he sawed off the barrel of his shotgun... And... I didn't go to the funeral. I don't get any applause? So why did you come? Jérémie? MY BEST PART I re-read it. Obviously. Really I... I loved it. All the revisions in the new draft. All the additions to Paul, the character. But above all, honestly... The real skill is that it's super precise without losing the mystery of the earlier drafts so... We totally get his relationship with Françoise. The double bond that they forge. The past... Then, all of a sudden, there's a... But you know that. Better than me, sorry. And... I'm quite moved because... It's the kind of part I'm rarely given in movies. And you're giving it to me. Thank you. I wanted us to talk before the summer vacation madness. Summer vacation madness? Yes. To say it turns out we won't work together on the film. I've changed my mind. I'm casting Ramzy instead. Losing you is like hacking off an arm. Enjoy. Please, let me explain. Last Sunday was my birthday. I turned 51. Thanks for your message. The night before, I broke up with a girl I met maybe 6 months ago. For no real reason. In fact, I think she was probably my ideal woman. Added to that, I have no kids. Paul, likewise, in the story. You get my spiral? It's not the producers saying you're a gamble or doubting you. Not at all! It really is me. And you can't play tennis. That comes into it. And for Paul, the racket is second nature. It's his way out, too. Sure, it's a tricky situation but I couldn't delay telling you. Quite frankly, the person who suffers most, as usual, is me. Babe, it's me. Look, I'm beat tonight. Don't be mad if I stay put and have a quiet night in. Love you. Shit! What do I do now? - You take out the uterus? - Yes. Let's clamp it. Like that. In ferrets also, penetration induces ovulation? Yes. And penetration has to hurt. It's the pain that triggers ovulation. - You can handle it? - Yes. Sir, we're closed. Who's the hunk? What are you doing here? Who are you? His husband, sir. We're not married. Out! Not married! What's that? A baby ferret. Get out, Jérémie! Congratulations. Audition for Spring Awakening. Playing Moritz. Interested? If the wheel won't turn, give it a nudge. Jean-François. Spring Awakening Why didn't you come to the film? A broken paw. On a Saint Bernard. Was it good? Yes. The suffering, the tears, it cleanses me. You're not sick of suffering? You don't understand me, Albert. Your passion touches and overwhelms me. My passion? Why aren't you passionate, baby? Why didn't you just say you were working that night? You don't plan for emergencies. Delivery was complicated. Giancarlo felt out of his depth. And you rock up during surgery to confront Giancarlo, my intern. Awkward! Giancarlo this, Giancarlo that! You sound like you're licking a smoothie! Jérémie! Come on. Albert... Baby? What's wrong now? Nothing, I'm hungry. Baby? You jerked off today? It's private. You don't ask that. I'm asking if you jerked off, that's all. Yes. This morning. So what? So what's the damp sperm on the blue t-shirt in the basket. I'm not crazy. 11 at night and this morning's sperm isn't dry? Stop. Who'd you jerk off with? This is a lot of sperm. Answer me or I jump. You're not getting better. So, the damp sperm that smells unlike yours? You know my sperm's smell? Quit calling it sperm. Sperm, sperm, sperm... Accept I know that smell, yes! Chill. You're not on stage. Too easy. What was the beep I heard in the shower? What beep? You looked through my phone? I don't know where it is. You don't know where it is? You looked? I didn't look but would I have a reason to? I knew it. See someone about your jealousy. Or we won't make it. Who is it? Who is it? Scram. Just scram! What kind of word is scram? What does that even mean? Albert? Ok, I'll leave, I'm gone. That's what it means. You're still here? How are you, napkin? Fine, fine. I just bought my ticket. I arrive tomorrow. I have a big audition on September 4 and I need to concentrate to learn my lines. So I'll be there for the tribute to dad. This is your home, too, napkin. Your Dutch regulars booked in this year? Mom? Yes, napkin? Are you going deaf? I asked if you have bookings. No. I mean, a few. It's quiet. I have my devotees. Mom, I'll call you back. I'm vibrating. See you tomorrow, napkin. See you tomorrow. My Jérémie, still in Paris? Free? I have an offer for you! Your favorite director ;-) - My leading man! - Hi, Sylvie. How are you? I rushed back from the pool, dripping wet. Come in. - Where can I put this? - Right there. Eddy? How about some service? Sugar? No, thanks. If you want, go. You don't have to stay. She exhausts and devours you. She's got it into her head to play Mathilde. Really? Acting in her own film, just imagine. You heard Pierre left her? For real. Right. I've had enough. The producers likewise. The office is going apeshit. So these vultures go round and round in the sky, then zoom down to the corpses. Watched by the families, like it's some kind of show. It's ultra-freaky with the vultures. Carnage. They come up with eyes and all. An extraordinary ritual. Like I said, another conception of nature. You were talking about me. Come on, I know. I get it. Sure, could be better but I'm good. 17 years married, no less. Just like that, gone up in smoke. May I? Yes, sure. Not too expensive, are you sure? I can't sleep so... When I can't sleep, I go on YouTube and I karaoke-binge Véronique Sanson and Michel Berger. It's fabulous, honestly. Kind of like Ravel. Yes, good spot. Please, let's go to Bahia. Sorry? Will you be there? When you lowered your gaze, you looked like James Stewart. Thanks. Anyway, I know you're wondering why I asked you here. It makes you laugh? No, it's not... Sure, it makes you laugh. That's so Sylvie. There she goes again. She gets these ideas, Sylvie. Why'd she ask him here? Right? That's your thinking, isn't it? You think I'm stupid or what? You think I'm blind? Blabbing behind my back. Sylvie, blablabla! Any subject or idea is one more chance to belittle me. Sylvie's nuts! She keeps changing her mind! Could you write it? You ever wrote a line of dialogue? Go ahead! It's my whole life, my heart! It's all I put into it! Do you understand that? I'm sick of being belittled. Sick! Like the producers, all day every day! No, that won't work! No, too expensive! Fuck! If I'm not here, nothing happens, right? I just explained... A film's like running a program? Punch it in and... Don't change a thing! Don't deviate! That's what life's about! Veering off in new directions. Get it? The unexpected! Right here, right now! If I want to touch even a tiny bit of beauty, what hope do I have surrounded by lunkheads like you? Yes! I'm going to play Mathilde. Because it's my film. It's my film. I call the shots. Got that? Do I make myself clear? It tires me out. I'm tired. I'm tired! Get that into your head! Dimwit! Reflexes! You see... Zero reaction, as ever! Come with me, Jérémie, into the living room. Only you are alive here. Come on. Sorry. - We're waiting. - I didn't get that. Jérémie, come closer. Closer. Will you agree to be my assistant? My coach? So I can be Mathilde. Yes? I mean, I don't understand, Eddy. I don't get all this. I have limits. Sorry, I'm an actor... Let me speak. I'm an actor, not a coach. I need work. Jérémie, I'm sorry. You complete jerk! Does it hurt? It hurts, Jérémie? Look at me. Does it hurt? Take your hand away. Show me. Show me where it hurts. What's wrong with me? Don't say that. You're so dark. Why does no one want me? What is it? Tell me. For those idiots, you're too big. Big? Too big a freak. Freak? You can't change the know-nothings. It'll work out. If you'd been acting in the sixties, you'd make movie after movie. Teleport me. No, don't. It's on me. Sorry, sir. Rejected. Do you want to try again? Of course. It's the chip. Needs rubbing. Still no go. You can get it next time. Albert? He's joining you at your mother's? No, we had a fall-out. I'm going to think things through. At Mom's, it's easier to learn my lines. For Spring Awakening. Yes, you need to nail it. The audition. If the wheel won't turn, give it a nudge. Work hard. Do nothing else. You were born to play Moritz. And you love the director, Emmanuel Wurth. I'm still the right age to play a tortured, suicidal teen? More than ever. Do you think I'm ill? The more I love him, the bigger the green-eyed monster grows. Who? Albert. As Shakespeare says, I feed on my own poison. It's an atrocious feeling. Honestly, it shakes me from head to foot so violently, like I'm blacking out. Then all I want is to disappear. Like in the play, with Moritz. Stop, I'm talking about my life. So how far do you go with your boyfriend? You snoop? You spy on him? No, are you nuts? Seriously! Bye, Jean-François. Sylvie called me up. I forbid you to coach her. I have my rent to pay. You refuse! All in! Hold on... What? Ladies and gentlemen, our next stop will be Saint-Auvent. You look awful. Your eye, what did you do? Let me see. I fell at a director's house earlier. My napkin. My napkin! Still not working? Sure, it works. Kevin repaired it. Who's Kevin? Stop fiddling, you'll mess it all up. So who's the hi-fi genius? He's an all-round genius. A very practical boy. Practical for what? Practically minded, I mean. So not like me. Your son's not practical. You do other things, napkin. You have a suit for tomorrow? I dug out one of your father's. The whole family's coming? The family, you know... Your grandmother's coming. Mireille too, of course. It'll all be fine, napkin. Dad always gave bad luck a hand. What makes you say that? He didn't choose to be poor. Or to have an idiot sister who stole his business. You judge people a lot. It's his Mireille's fault. The mare with clammy hands. He was lost. Panic-stricken. I tried to show him life was good. If you knew all I did. I know, I was there. You don't know. It's your autistic act. You didn't see. You were there but you didn't see. I'm not autistic, mom. I just took off, far away from it all. Marilyn paints her lips She thinks of John Only John A smile Then a sigh She hums an old song Not sad Nor gay Inbetween a few interviews What a girlie! You think you're a star? Look at his little ponies! Leave him alone! Out now! Hello, darling sunbeam kisses! Paying your respects this bright morning? Annette! Annette! Yes? Morning, napkin. Get dressed, we leave in one hour. Yes. The suit looks fab on you. Dad kept himself trim. At your age, sure. Let me see that. Scary, how dark it is at night here. C'mon, napkin. I always forget. It's what we like here. Peace and quiet. Problems? Leave them at home. Patrick. Morning. Why do you call him napkin? When he was little, Jérémie slept anywhere. In a closet, in a corner of a barn... One time, after looking everywhere, we found him in a hutch with the baby rabbits. To this day, don't serve him rabbit! It's true, no rabbit. Sit yourself down. I am Klaudia, Patrick's wife. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, too. My condolences for your daddy. He was an actor also? No, he worked for a firm of undertakers. And he... He prepared the... Annette! Jürgen! Karolyn. - Here. - What a beautiful carp! Who's he? That's Kevin. Why's he here? I need him, that's all. Granny! My darling Denis! My Denis, my lovely Denis. Goodness, stop touching my boobs, my butt, my knees. Keep those paws off me. Goodness me! He can't keep his hands to himself! That's not Denis, Yvette. It's Jérémie. Beauty queen! Beauty queen! Come on... Denis, take a photo of us. Come on, queenie. Thank you. Let's go. Goodbye. Sweet. Let's go. - Where to? - Over there. Where over there? Careful, slippery. - Let's go. - Who is that again? Where's my Denis? Denis? Marvelous. Marvelous. I love it. I love you all! You want to say a word for Denis? You were his first wife, after all. I have nothing special to say. You say a word. I loved your music! What's wrong, small stuff? Not feeling yourself? For your father, it's all relative. There are bigger tragedies worldwide. Those poor people caught in the fires in Spain. Guy jumps with his daughter into the sea to save her. Both splat on the rocks. And the Armenians... Massacred after fleeing a famine. Look at this beautiful potato. Look at it. It's yours. All yours. Here. And now. There you go. That's my philosophy. Find yours. - Like that? - Yes. There we are. Sometimes I feel like an apple core on compost waiting to biodegrade. Sometimes you spout a lot of shit. It's good, it doesn't stink or smell rotten. Kevin built it for me. Out of some old planks. Good old Kevin. I'd never have built it for you. Give me a break with Kevin. Somebody has to help me. Unbelievable, you are so jealous! A real beast! Fucking wi-fi! What are you doing? Can you help fold these? I'm learning my lines for the audition. You copy them out? Like thoughts that I'm jotting down. So I can act out my own words, see? What an impostor! The ego-trip! All actors do that? I don't know. Actors talk a lot with each other but not about their process. Like me, when other rental hosts stop by. I expect to find all my good ideas stolen for their places. Like the cross-stitch alphabet by the water heater. Saw it? No, it's not the same, mom. Not a bit. Actors have nothing better to do than gab about themselves. In all the magazines. Mom, let me get on with my Moritz. What's the story about? Speech it to me. I'll pitch it. Speech it! It's the story of a melancholy young man in a hostile world tormented by his burgeoning sexuality. He commits suicide. One for you. So said my agent. Let's do a read-through. You'll run lines with me? Yes. I'll need my finger, I have no glasses. Who am I? There. I start. Have you ever felt them? What? How did you put it? Male excitements? Uh... For a long time, yes. Nearly a year now. It felt like a bolt of lightning. Had you dreamed? This won't work. Door! Shit! Can you see me ok? Yes. And hear me ok? Yes, yes. What's wrong with your eye? Nothing. You ok? Yeah. And how's Giancarlo? Don't go there. You're going there. He's hot and he works for you. Ideal for a relaxing rosé after a busy day. All above board, of course. I sense these things. Didn't you know? I'm a sorcerer. I can read ponds. Ponds? Yes. And potato peelings. I saw you guys. It's over, Jérémie. Albert? Reception's bad. Don't interrupt. Do not interrupt me. Last time, you said... Watch out! I have my eye on you. You remember? No? - Yes. - Who does this? To the man he loves? I love you. I need time. I need space. How much time? I've no idea. I won't calculate anymore. Got it? I won't photocopy the office appointments anymore, week after week, to show who I see, who I meet. To let you know if I run over for five measly minutes. I'll find a solution for... - No. - Yes. No. It's over. Goodbye, Jérémie. Annette? Bernadette? Yes. She's not here. Kevin? Do you have a motorcycle? A trail bike. Do you think it's locked? Is that Annette? Yes. She won Miss Haute Vienne. She's super beautiful. Mommy bombshell. Too bad I don't remember her like that. I never thought dad would keep all this. You still have your father? Fathers go, you know. You really want to sleep here? Yes, but don't tell my mother. I told her I was at my cousin's. Look, a young man on the bridge! Can I make a confession, sister? Yes. I'm jealous. Chronically jealous. I love him badly. I can't help raising the veil. Love can't be wrong if it's love. I used to be jealous of my companions. The relationship they had with God. He annoyed me, too, for giving Himself to everyone. I came to terms with it. The jealousy was part of me. I came to terms with feeling it. It became a path to something else. Abandonment, perhaps. I shall pray for your heart to find peace. But peace doesn't mean feeling nothing. Yes? She says she has something for you. It's a decoction of holly. Spiky, with red berries, in Christmas decorations? So it's pixie dust. It won't work. On me. As well as grief. Be patient. It's very effective for what ails you. Self-hatred. Yearning for vengeance at the same time as consolation. The capricious child clinging on. As well as grief. Sister Izumi is right. Have faith in her. It's ideal if you need affection and attention. That must be my mother. I have to go. Yes, it's her. Yes? I did my best. They're still damp. Above all, never lose hope. Take care of yourself. Thank you, I got that. Thanks. Thanks for everything, mothers. We're sisters. Your sisters. What are you trying to do? Commit suicide like your father? Find God? Find the truth perhaps. You're not to blame for your father's death. Why do you say that? It's a weird thing to say. I never thought that, you know. You never tell me about your love life. Stop that, please. High beam. I'm on high beam. Turn it off, you're dazzling people. There. Here comes sleepyhead. How long did I sleep? Almost 13 hours. It wasn't a dream, the sisters? No, absolutely not a dream. I drove nearly 100 km in all. Well... Happy birthday. It's my birthday? Behind you. The little love. His name is Hector du Poitou. It's tradition. And what do they call you? Olivier Faber. I shall name him Gugus. I love him already. Thank you, mom. You look great together. I'll show him around. I hope he gets on with the cats. I am so happy. It felt like a bolt of lightning. Only a very brief dream. Legs in sky blue stockings. Legs in sky blue stockings climbing onto the desk. All I could think was... All I could think was they wanted to straddle it. Straddle it. Need something? No. Good evening! I was learning my lines when I heard a noise. And... You're a good swimmer. It keeps the beer belly away. Sneaks up on you, this stuff. Want one? Can I see your book? Why do you look at me so strangely? Have you ever felt them? What? How did you put it? Male excitements. Uh... Of course. Me too. For a long time, yes. Nearly a year now. It felt like a bolt of lightning. Had you dreamed? Only a brief dream. Legs in sky blue stockings climbing on the desk. As if to straddle it. I only glimpsed them. George Zirschnitz dreamed of his mother. Georg Zirschnitz. Georg. Dreamed of his mother. If you knew my turmoil since that night. Remorse? Remorse... The fear of death. Good Lord! I thought I was incurable, suffering from an inner pain. A strange game played upon us. I don't recall wishing for such an excitement. My dear parents could have had 100 better children, but I came along. Haven't you wondered, Melchior? How we were caught in this whirl? You've got it down. You'll land the job. I appreciate it but it's not that easy. It'd be amazing for me, for sure. There's you in this Moritz. Straight-talking but complicated. You're beautiful all over, it's nuts. I'm not into guys. Your mom didn't say? No, no but sure, sure. What do you like in a guy? It's a mystery to me, a boy. A man even more so. I love it 'cause I don't get them, I think. I really don't get them. And in bed? Is that a real question? I adore blowing them. Ok, got it. That's my dog! I'd like love to sweep me away. My girlfriend needs commitment. I don't know if I'm ready. Then I think about her and get an erection. Thinking about her now, I'd pop a boner. Almost. You got someone in Paris? Yes. His name's Albert. But it's over. Sorry. I'd like love to sweep me away, too. Your puppy's adorable! Looks at you like the first human. It's true. Because he's the new man in my life. This is getting too girlie for me. I'm not saying go. No, I'm going to bed. Not sad Nor gay Inbetween a few interviews It's a love that foams in the bath, it's nuts Marilyn sings his name She makes up some new songs About the wedding of a star and a lion What's going on? Couldn't you knock? Tonight, Spritzes in the lounge. You know, at my age, with my libido gone long, long ago, due to illness, unhappiness, and all your father heaped on me... It destroyed me. Yes, he destroyed me. But since then... it all glides by. I just live, you see. People do this, people do that... It has no importance now. You load up your Spritzes. I know what I'm like. I'm a Gemini. Two sides. You're a Goat too. Dad destroyed you? What are you saying? I remember it clearly. I even started to hate books. On the bookshelves in the blue room, where all the books were mine, 'cause your father only read car ads, I found all his love letters. Just think! Letters from his floozies, hidden, stashed, inserted in my books! My dictionaries! I burned the lot. Threw the books away. Disowned them. That's awful. I had no idea. And I can still see my Denis, at night, before bed, coming closer, caressing me, holding me, like men do when they want... See? No. A hole, right. A hole. And I... I pushed him away like that. I couldn't bear his touch anymore. And him? And him? He obeyed. Whenever I said I didn't want him in bed with me, he didn't argue, and went to sleep on the couch with the TV on. Meanwhile, you were in a world of your own. With your little ponies. You were no more than that high. You know, Jérémie... Nothing is harder than realizing the person you love most is someone you'll never desire again. Never make love with again. It's horrible. But since his death... What? It's crazy. I desire him again. Your father and I... We had no luck. But I had you. And that's... It's huge. Go, don't hold back your wings, my beauty Your wings too are just as pretty Don't try to understand I've known for so long That tender turns to bland And love sings a new song You just got the wrong page Tender has not changed He headed for new horizons To begin a new journey Spread your wings wide, my beauty You should try it too, you'll see What do you know of my wings? And who clipped them short? Who ensnared the swallow And put her in the chicken coop? You can take my word for it I didn't ask for life It was my best ever romance Please don't spoil it I combed your wings, my beauty Now, you're going to leave with Gugus and give your all at the audition. You'll be with your puppy and your theatre. It's a whole new chapter. If I'm going to fly again I'll need time to learn Of all the things to say You never forgot how to fly You fly higher than I ever did You can fly lower too And if my head spins I'll be there to fly with you And we'll keep our wings My beauty What's he doing? It wasn't to be. Let them trample each other if they want. I shut the door behind me and walk in open air. I'm not so fond of a stampede. Things must turn out however they turn out. I savor the unspeakable horror of separation. I sob melancholy tears over my destiny. Life turned its back on me. When the cup sinks, the butterfly takes wing, and the mirage fades. Stop this senseless game of lies. Now, darkest night. Now, I won't go home anymore. Again? What can I say? It's a very personal take on the part. Almost too personal at times but... It's you. Thank you. Thank you. This won't be easy. It takes us somewhere new. Obviously. At least there's something going on. Adrien Zeligman? Two months later Baby, what's wrong? No, this isn't happening! My baby! Get out of the way! Out the way! Quickly! I'm scared of losing him. Don't worry, Jérémie. Come back in 3 hours. Quickly! Let's go, Jérémie. The operation went well. I detected an irregular heartbeat when I examined him. An ECG and echocardiogram revealed an issue with the connection between auricles and ventricles, resulting in anarchic contractions and incipient heart failure. We gave him a pacemaker. - Really? - Yes. He'll feel much better now. - Right? - Yes. His life will follow its course, no worries. Yes. I recommend lots of exercise. Long walks. You'll give him medication every day. And most importantly, checkup echoes early on. I see. You don't have to do them here. But make sure you do them. That'll do it. I have no words. For once. Thank you. You're welcome. Can I give him a hug? He's groggy from the anesthetic. We'll keep him here for observation until tomorrow. - He's fine. - All right. Truly. It's a shipwreck, both of us, babe? Why a shipwreck? It's a real torment. I'm not the only reason for your torment. As you should know. I gotta take off, animals to look after. Just... It's important for me to say, I loved you. I'll love you for a lifetime. Same here. That's ok then. You'll come to see the play? Don't wait for me. You and I need some distance between us. I want to get back my balance. Sounds stupid to you? No. I understand. Don't stay next to someone who's torn himself apart. I have something to tell you, too. It's not easy 'cause I don't want to... You know, to fuel your... To crank up your thing. What? Talk. You were right about... About Giancarlo. We have something. Nothing major for now but... it's there. It exists. All right? I sensed it. Just shows I'm not so... No. Not so... I get it. I scram. I mean, re-scram. Look at me one last time. Again. My napkin, it's me. I can picture you on stage now. That's great. I'm pleased for you. You had it spot-on with Olivier Faber. You remember, the breeder who brought Gugus? I'd given up on it and... And there you go. We have a date tonight. We'll see, I won't get my hopes up. Won't get my hopes up. By the way Olivier says, give Gugus taurine. For his heart. It's in beef. In eggs. And in octopus. Mash up some octopus for him. I saved the best till last. I have the Vacations France label. I got the certification. Guess how many Gold Corns. Four and a half! Out of five! How long to go? About ten minutes. It'll be fine. Thanks. That's it, my little prince in clover. This was mama calling. All my love. Be good. Be good. Your cue. Yes, it's my cue. Hey. He's grown. What a surprise! That's the aim. You good? - You? - Sure, I'm good. Come here. You took all the beauty in the world And you gave it a face You took all the sailors' songs And you made them into a place I take what you give and turn it into our love To both our faces of velvet I take what you give and turn it into our love To all our places forever The road was long and took many turns Through my mother country in the Limousin Misgivings gave way to become forts Learning to believe in tomorrow I take what you give and turn it into our love To both our faces of velvet I take what you give and turn it into our love To all our places forever You, jealousy, you make my blood churn Grant me now some respite This guy blows me away with his innocence For him I'd build a new realm Take what I give and turn it into our love Sculpt our faces of velvet Take what I give and turn it into our love You are my land
