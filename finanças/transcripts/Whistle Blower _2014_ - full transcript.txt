Although inspired by true events, this film is a work of fiction A MEGABOX Inc. PLUS M Presentation Let me tell you an amusing story. Johns Hopkins researchers put sensors on a Korean's fingers, and were astounded. A Watermelon Pictures Production Co-produced by B Plus Pictures and were astounded. We're 60 times more developed than an average American. Dr. Lee Jang-hwan's Guest Lecture: 'Biotech and Future of Korean Science' Dr. Simon visited our lab, and saw our SCNT technique, and exclaimed, Unbelievable, so fantastic! He was utterly in shock. There's only 1 reason why I study stem cells: to give those with incurable disease a hope, and that is why I'm standing here now. I should be in the lab conducting experiments, PARK HAE-IL I should be in the lab conducting experiments, but as I dedicate 3 hours to you all, LEE KYUNG-YOUNG but as I dedicate 3 hours to you all, even if just 3 of you in this crowd YOO YEON-SEOK even if just 3 of you in this crowd YOO YEON-SEOK take my baton and contribute to the science, WRITTEN BY LEE CHUN-HYUNG take my baton and contribute to the science, WRITTEN BY LEE CHUN-HYUNG WRITTEN BY LEE CHUN-HYUNG I'd be forever grateful. Thank you. After publishing his personalized stem cell thesis in Bioresearch journal, Dr. Lee became a strong candidate for a Nobel Prize. DIRECTED BY YIM SOON-RYE Dr. Lee became a strong candidate for a Nobel Prize. Another big round of applause! THE WHISTLE BLOWER She was a healthy gal with a strong body. But after a visit to the clinic, she felt queasy, and passed out like a log. These kids didn't know their mom was dead, and lived days with her body. And those clinic bastards are something. They said they never had her as a patient. They even showed me a chart to prove it! Goddammit... So, out of desperation, I called you as a last resort. Why? You're PD Chase! - I see, right. - Goddamn... Thank you for that. Producer! Producer! Sir! Can't you at least let me know if you'll air it? I hear you loud and clear, but you'll have better luck with the police. That'll be much faster. They won't listen to me! If you want to report, at least fill in the holes in the story. As you say, if she was so healthy, why'd she drop dead after a surgery? It doesn't make sense. Eggs! What? She went there... to sell her eggs. Restricted Area Who are you? Isn't this a clinic? No, it's not. That's weird, I was told it was this building. You're wrong, just walk away. My wife said she went to this clinic... I don't give a damn about your wife. I guess I'm wrong. Newman Medical Current Affairs Department One moment please. Newman's involvement complicates things. How come? Illegal eggs trickling into an infertility clinic, we got a story! Don't you know about Newman? They're Dr. Lee Jang-hwan's joint research laboratory. Didn't know? It's Dr. Lee's official oocyte supplier. Don't stir anything up without proper evidence. My balls are tingling. I can start gathering evidence. He's a national pride. If you do a half-assed job, we'll all get the noose. You're scared, aren't ya? Watch your mouth! Just don't do it. Promise me. I'll be watching you. Fine. I don't like headaches anyway. Yeah, it's me. You got a friend in Dr. Lee's team, right? To be absolutely clear, my team operates under very high and strict ethical standards. Including these oocytes, we've met all international science community rules... What are you doing in the dark? Didn't want to wake up Su-bin. I put the house up for sale. It'll be okay, sweetie. Daddy will be here with your medicine. Hold on, sweetie. Hello? My name is Yoon Min-chul of PD Chase. Is... Isn't this Mr. Shim Min-ho's phone? No, you got the wrong number, there's no such a person. But it's the right num... Honey, let's take the meds, you'll feel better. Stem Cell Research Institute Where were you? The doc was asking for you. - Me? - Go on. Yes? Did you want to see me? - Please come in. - Thank you. It's just that... This could be rather awkward, but I'll just say it since we're all family here. I know how difficult it has been for you two because of Su-bin, and I should've done more to convince Dr. Shim to stay... Somehow it feels like it's all my fault... Please don't say that sir. I arranged the best hospital and doctors for Su-bin, so don't worry anymore. But sir... you mustn't... Mrs. Shim, I will not abandon those who put their hearts to our cause. This is my honest gesture, so please accept. Thank you. Dr. Lee Jang-hwan is entering. A big round of applause please! Ladies and gentlemen, please take your seats. International Stem Cell Bank Supporters' Night Ladies and gentlemen, and Minister, Thank you so much for coming. A few days ago, New York Times reporter visited our lab. He said world science communities and media are watching me, for successfully creating clinical stem cells from a patient somatic cells. So I told this reporter. 'Keep an eye on Korea instead of me. We suffered a major war, and received care from the world. But now it's our time to become the forerunner in biotechnology.' This night cannot be about me. This night, belongs to these children, who will soon get back on their feet, and become our future leaders. I will help them get back up! Please keep an eye on us. Doctor, over here please! Smile wide! Where are you going? We need to talk. I'll be late, don't wait up. Honey. Side effects and sequelae of oocyte donation - I challenge you! - Ji-ho, please. I challenge you! I'm so scared! I'm busy, so go play with mom. Go on now, hurry! In the name of justice, I will not forgive you. Honey, please. Ji-ho, I told you! Mom! Dad won't play with me. Min-chul, go answer the door! Hello? Is this... are you... producer Yoon Min-chul? Yes, Mr. Shim? I'd like to meet you. Going somewhere? - Going somewhere? - Just for a moment. - Producer Yoon? - Yes, yes. Good evening. I'm from Dr. Lee Jang-hwan's research lab. Please accept this gift on his behalf. Perfect rendezvous point. Not a soul around. Mr. Yoon. Between truth and national interest, which comes first? The truth, of course. Ultimately, it serves the national interest. I do not have any evidence. Would you still believe me? If this isn't a test, then absolutely. I know how difficult it is to come forward. I know you're in a tough spot, and there are countless patients counting on him, which complicates this matter, but that shouldn't justify his illegal actions. There's a report of illegal oocytes trickling into his lab... There aren't any stem cells. What? His stem cell theses are... all works of fabrication. There never was... a single cloned stem cell. Are you... serious? One moment. I just remembered I quit smoking 2 years ago. Do you smoke? We could talk in a few hours at work, no need to wake me up at this hour! Didn't you quit smoking? Damn, this is so messed up. I just can't believe it. Is the whistleblower credible? He has no reason to lie. He had a fall out with Dr. Lee, but his wife still works for him, and his daughter's in the mix. Why'd he risk everything if it wasn't true? Dammit... Evidence? None, we gotta do all the work. Damn... Not a single one? The stem cell, I mean. Not one? Global Channel NBS Honesty, Impartial, Open So what? You never asked for my permission before. So? Want me to take all the heat? Sons of bitches... They gotta have at least one! They can't be bluffing with an empty hand! How can they lie about having 11? Does that make sense?! How can they pull off this against the entire bioresearch community? This isn't feasible unless they're insane! See that? That's what I call logic! That's the proper logic of a broadcast veteran! Can you feel the monumental backlash? So, do we do this or not? Don't ask me that, idiot. That's for our chief to decide. Chief? - Let me think! - Okay. - Min-chul. - Sir. I have some clout as a chief, right? I actually do want to be cool and tell you to proceed. But this is a catch-22 situation. When we start digging, heads will roll. Let me ask you this then. Between truth and national interest, what's more important? What a load of BS... - What's more important? - Yes. Truth is the national interest. Happy? It's settled then. Say what? - So it's decided? - Do it! Chief, make it irrefutable. I just told you, proceed. Okay, I'll proceed. Secrecy is of utmost importance. - This stays between 3 of us. - Okay. Good day. Shim Su-bin Su-bin... What happened? - Su-bin... - Dr. Shim. Do you call yourself a father? Thank god Mrs. Shim called me in time. It could've been bad. I'll leave you alone. I know how busy you are, thank you so much Not at all. Don't worry, and call me any time. Boss, what happened? What's the emergency? Min-chul's waiting downstairs, go to him right away. What? He'll give you the details. Huh? What's... Iseul! You know how much I love you, right? - What? - Yeah. You're the department ace, so don't resent me later. Go! Go! Say what?! I don't believe this... There's not even one?! Is that a protocol question? Why's everyone asking me that? But the cloned animals have to be real though! The first cloned cow, Chorong, then the mad cow-resistant cow, and there was that dog. - Molly. - Molly! They were all over the news. What of all the reports now? That's why Korea's all messed up! I tried really hard to understand you. You quit the lab without a word with me, and I didn't want to trouble you with all the debt that's piling up. But I really cannot get you today. Where have you been all night? If you're tired, just say so, I won't resent you for it. It's not that... When she stabilizes, let's move her to another hospital. I can't, she can't get a better treatment elsewhere! I can't trust you anymore, how can I leave her with you? Honey... Just look how bad things are! Final loan notice... Where are we? We gotta interview the informant before he changes his mind. Don't you even know the basics of our work? Listen, when I call, get the camera and come up. - Got it? - Yup. Good afternoon. Glad you're home, I was worried you wouldn't be... I'm sorry. Let's drop everything. What? Wait, Mr. Shim! It's natural to feel hesitant, you're supposed to be. And I know you're in a tough spot. If you need some time... - No. - I'll come back... I won't change my mind. I'm sorry for your trouble. What, aren't we doing an interview? He'll need some time. Why?! Make up your damn mind! If coming forward was easy, why's the world so messed up? Let's get to the next step! There's plenty of fish in the pond. Say what? We got reporting to do. You're the first deaf ace I've ever seen. Get in! My fortuneteller was right about a messed up year. Even birds drop from the sky at Dr. Lee's command. Use someone on his bad side? No hospital will take him. Shim's career is all but over in the research field. Can't you find a way? You got some clout. I'm just a petty surgeon, what can I do? Why is this industry so gloom and doom? It's not like he didn't know how the world worked. He didn't have to come forward. What a dick... Fine, enough about that. Who's the expert in this field? Who should I interview? Isn't Dr. Lee a veterinary college graduate? He may be an expert in animals, but not humans. So he lined up all the top medical professors and brought in Newman Medical, and received oocytes and researchers. Cloning stem cells won't cure incurable diseases right away, there are many hurdles to overcome. I see. Misleading media is a problem. As well as government that waste tax money without all due process. And scholars that are begging for crumbs on Dr. Lee's table. They are the worst. Mr. Shim! Evening. I'm really in a tight spot. Could you do me a favor and let me be? Please give Dr. Yoo Jong-jin a call. He said it'sa pity to waste talent and found you a job. That's what I came here to say. For your child's sake, be strong. My kid is Su-bin's age. When I grow up, I wanna be a good doctor like dad. And help sick kids like me. I'm proud of dad more than anything in the world. Dad, I love you! He'd be so happy when hears this, right? Hankuk University Hospital Between you and Su-bin, I have so much to apologize for. I thought about what the best thing for us all is. This is the best I can do. I'll be at mother's for a while. Call me there if you need me. Divorce Agreement NBS station, please. 'MYSTERY OF LIFE' TEAM ONLY! No stem cells are registered at any tissue banks. No stem cells are registered at any tissue banks. None are being screened either. And Dr. Lee's animal cloning research theses? I scoured for those, but couldn't find a single one. They only exist in the news articles. So I called up his lab and requested them. And? They're too busy to check. I filed an official request, so I'm waiting on that. Oh yeah, I almost forgot! The most important of all! - I couldn't believe my eyes. - What is it? It's an organization chart for Dr. Lee's lab. How can they have more PR staff than researchers? Check out the next page. It's a list of media people maintained by their PR. Right here. You are listed right smack in the middle. I'm told you even received a prime beef gift set recently. What? This is why the press is so favorable towards Dr. Lee. Do you see now? This is how he became famous without ever publishing a paper. Interviewee list? None yet. I've been gathering these all day. Didn't I tell you not to slack off? I'll get to that right now! Someone's all energetic thanks to prime beef, but not me! Cut the shit! Be quiet. Hello? Yes? Right now? Yes, I understand. Get your stuff. What? Whistleblower interview. Interview? Even those listed as co-authors on the thesis never participated in the research, so none of them saw it of course. So, stem cell cloning was never successful? Never. While I was a team leader, we've never once cloned it. But they could have succeeded after your resignation. Unlike how our team is perceived by the public, there's no researcher who could pull it off. We've never succeeded even with thousands of oocytes, so it's illogical to make 11 in just a short few months. We have never... cloned a single stem cell. What's troubling is the fact that human clinical trial is being prepped. This is a matter of life and death. 'Personalized stem cell' may seem legit, but its safety is far from certain. There's also a high chance of it developing into cancer. Pardon? Cancer? There's no telling what a stem cell will become. It could be a heart, bone marrow or a tumor. Right now, it's like a rugby ball, it could go anywhere. Even if this problem is solved, human clinical trial should be years away. It must've been very difficult to come forward. What was your motivation to do so? I became a doctor to save lives, and I joined Dr. Lee's research team in order to save my child and many others... But when I found out that he was creating false hope, it was... too hard to bear. And most of all, I wanted to be a proud dad to my child, who may not live long. Thank you for everything. Please rest up now. Okay, good evening. Bye now. When the interview airs, your daughter will be proud. It's all in your hands now. Meeting in progress Left is an embryonic stem cell from a fertilized egg. The right is cloned embryonic stem cell. Cloning is done with SCNT technique, where nucleus of an egg is removed and a donor nucleus is implanted. According to Dr. Lee, he said he developed this technique, how valid is that claim? I found out during my research that it was used in Japan in the '90s. - Are you positive? - Of course I am. So, we got everything? This already gives me a headache! Take things slow and we'll get there. Hello? Dude, I don't know if I should be doing this. I almost died because of your favor. You can't die, you're my best bud. If I go to prison for leaking patient records... I'll send you contrabands, so what happened? You were right. The kid in the picture is one of the somatic cell-donors in the thesis, and the first clinical trial patient. Give me the address. Yes, yes. I think I love you. Dr. Lee giving hope to boy with incurable disease Park Su-hyun... Okay! Hey, Iseul! How can you sleep right now? Sir, I was... Get the gear and come! Where are we going? On an assignment, at least wipe your eyes. - So unrefined. - I found it, boss! I found out how they faked the stem cells. Boss! Look at this. They said they have 11 stem cells, right? Did you stay up learning to count? - Look here! - What? 'Cloned stem cells and embryonic stem cells look so similar, it is difficult to tell apart.' That's what it says right here. How many embryonic stem cells does Newman have? Bingo! 11! This is too precise to be a mere coincidence. Why? They lied that these embryonic cells are clones! Remember that I discovered this, PD Chase's intrepid ace! If we obtain DNA of Newman's embryonic stem cell and match it with the stem cells in the thesis, then it's all over! Game over! - My dear Iseul. - Yes? Are you kidding me? What do you mean? He conned the entire world. Why'd he use such a simple method? How could someone who skimmed a few papers figure it out? You think this world is that easy? Damn... It's a possibility, that's all I'm saying. Where are we going? The first clinical trial subject, we're going to obtain DNA of the somatic cell donor in the thesis. If the DNA does not match, we can prove the paper was faked. Right? That's what you call a smoking gun, idiot! Get in! There's a weird rumor going around. What? Reporters are digging into stem cells. What do you mean? Honestly... Who here has seen a cloned stem cell? We only heard that it was done. But no one has seen it in person. Did Dr. Shim say anything? Make sure to keep a lid on him. He's the likeliest leak among us. We've been tailing Dr. Shim for a while. I never asked you to do that. I'm sorry, sir, we didn't want to disturb you. But he is the one who went to the station. He even did an interview. And... the station requested a copy of the thesis. How should I proceed? We must comply. Since you came so far, I wish I could do the interview. But Dr. Lee cordially asked us not to. I see. The documentary we're shooting is about explaining ins and outs of biotechnology for the general audience. And we plan to have an interview with Dr. Lee soon. It's not that I don't trust you, Mr. Yoon. Right. May I give Dr. Lee a quick call? What? I've been calling him, but he's a busy man... Of course. The call cannot be connected... No answer. He's the busiest man in all of Korea. It'd be a disservice to bother him now. - I guess so. - Right. What should we do first? To start off, we'd like to obtain DNA from your son. - DNA? - Yes. It's an important data for our documentary. And it was openly revealed in the thesis so it's no problem. Right, please go ahead. Okay. - Go on. - Sure. - It won't hurt. - So handsome. Yes, doctor. NBS came here to do a report. They'd like to obtain Su-hyun's DNA. Yes. He'd like to speak to you. - Me? - Yes. Sure. Hello? Producer Yoon Min-chul? Great to speak with you, I've heard a lot about you. I'm so honored. We've never spoken but how do you know my name? You're doing an expose on biotech, how could I not? I wish you all the best, and hope to see a great episode. Yes, thank you so much. - Here you go. - What did he say? Well, he'd like us to proceed. Right. Come on, continue. Okay. Su-hyun, could you say ah? When do I get the surgery? Dr. Lee adores him so much that he promised to allow him to be the 1st clinical test subject. Is that so? Shall we get some fresh air? Pastor, sir. Listen to me very carefully. Clinical trial isn't very safe at all. You should consult an expert first. And if you must proceed, announce it officially to the press. I don't... This is my card, and an expert contact info. There's no need to inform Dr. Lee, please give him a call. Mr. Yoon. I trust Dr. Lee implicitly. Good day. He's not a messiah, what's with all the blind faith? Min-chul! What's with him? ATTN: Producer Yoon Min-chul Copy of Cloning of Molly thesis - Who brought this here? - What is it? Someone from Dr. Lee's lab came by earlier. Hurry, find an expert who can verify this. Okay. I heard you 2 prepped our animal cloning patent, I hope you'd assist me in prepping stem cell patent too. - Of course. - Sure. Okay! I've been too busy to do it myself, so there's a rumor going around. It's all secured here, so please treat them carefully. Did you tell the press that there aren't any stem cells? How could you lie like that? For Su-bin's sake, how could you have done that? You shouldn't turn a blind eye to the truth. You know what goes on in the lab. How long will you ignore that? If this is for Su-bin's sake, we must stand tall. That doesn't make any sense. There aren't any cloned stem cells. There never was, and there never will be. It was impossible from the beginning. You saw all those oocytes that came in, where do you think they're from? What about planting human somatic cells in animals? Dr. Lee will do even worse things for his career and ambition. No, I don't care. If it means Su-bin will get a stem cell treatment, I'll do anything! So it's your conscience that's bothering you? That's a luxury we can't afford! - Honey! - I saw them! Cloned stem cells in the storage! With my own eyes! What? Do-hyung, it's me. Let me ask you something. There aren't any cloned stem cells, right? Why would you think that? What? What are you talking about? You mean you actually did it? I'm hanging up. Do-hyung, Do-hyung! Dr. Lee sent me this thesis on Molly. I verified it with an expert and there's nothing wrong with it. The lab will send others too, what the hell happened? No, this is impossible So suddenly... That's what I want to ask you. You should be giving me answers right now. I really don't know what's going on. Even if this is true, cloning animal and human stem cells are different domain. You said everything's fake, that Dr. Lee was lying the whole time! But now that there's evidence, you're saying it's something different? What if more evidences pile up? You'll say something else, how can I trust you?! Is this a joke to you?! Of course not! I don't know what's going on, but I only told you the truth! Then tell me! How can you be so sure that there isn't a cloned stem cell?! There's gotta be evidence to support your claim! Your words aren't enough, I need a reason to trust you! And I need it now! I already told you, there is no evidence! I need evidence! I got here on your word alone. I put my career and my life on the line! So tell me, you'll never get another chance! After this moment, I will not be able to trust you. Whether you trust me or not, I only told the truth, and that will not change. You got here by putting everything on the line, but I got here by throwing them away. I told you the truth. I hope it's not discourteous to bring top publishers here. Not at all! I grew up poor, so I love these street huts. It's very humbling. By the way, you look pale, is something the matter? No, I'm fine. Don't you worry. Future of Korea rests on your shoulder, how could we not worry? Actually, a former researcher made some false accusations recently. What? He's a good man, but he held grudge for not putting his name in the thesis. We didn't know. It's all my fault, I was rather inconsiderate. Don't trouble yourself, we'll take care of it. Thank you. I don't believe it, look at this son of a bitch! His identity should be made public and lynched! - You're right. - Goddamn bastard! Son of a bitch! Grudge for not co-authoring? He probably took bribes! He probably took bribes! Piece of trash... Yes? I'm on my way! Making false accusations due to mounting debt? I'm on my way! Making false accusations due to mounting debt? Have you gone mad?! For a story of this magnitude, you should've let us know, and verified the informant. But the thing is, we can't judge the informant based on negative publicity sourced from Dr. Lee's camp. Please listen to the full story from my team... We've heard enough! Drop this before the tsunami hits. If there's reasonable doubt, it's our job to look into it. Producer has the editorial control, not the board! This has the ear of the president. What about the media outlets who sold Dr. Lee's name? What's true and false isn't important here. The public already believes it, that's the key. And is there a proof that stem cells aren't real? The thing is, if you give us some time... That's all I need to hear. What are they doing without evidence? Where the hell is Min-chul! That bastard! I know... Taking after Dr. Lee, Molly is extremely smart. She always finds her way back to the temple on her own. I see. Boss, should we be here? It must be chaos back at the station. Turn off your cellphone. She even knows not to bark in the temple. Sometimes tourists give her pieces of meat, but she never takes any. Her conduct is so proper that she's better than some of us. She's the pride of this temple. Does Dr. Lee ever come visit Molly? He's a terribly busy man. But he does call from time to time. There's a tinge of sadness in his voice though. He must think of Molly when he's tired. I see. Sir, where can we find Molly? We have to shoot right away. If you walk into the village, you'll come across her. I see. It's a stupid dog. It never barks at people and sleeps all day. Don't you watch the news? This is Molly. She's a cloned dog. Tons of money was spent on her. What? Who has that money to burn? Why make a stupid dog like that? You're better off with a mutt. My Lassie is so much smarter. Here, Molly, it's a sausage. Molly! Here! Eat it! That's good, take it. She's getting up... Is she sick? Here, Molly, that's a good girl. Molly! Molly! Molly! What's wrong with her? What should we do? Take her to a vet? Whoa... The tumor is too big, she won't survive. - What? - Pardon? It's a common symptom among cloned animals. They age much faster and higher chance of cancer too, I don't know why they keep cloning. You should put her down. It must be unbearably painful. At least let her die in peace. That's... not something we can decide on our own. Then talk to the owner, and don't take too long. Who was she cloned for? This is too much... Get her DNA. What?! What's the verdict? Su-hyun is indeed the donor. And Molly checked out. It was still worth a try. What do we tell them now? They must be waiting for us. I'm too scared to do this! This is not right! I can't believe this! Here, take a look. This form is just a formality, but you know what he wants. Informed Consent Form for Oocyte Donation This form is just a formality, but you know what he wants. This could come back to bite us. It was fishy when I was asked to close the lid on the donor ledger. No, it's probably nothing. Of course it is. Dr. Lee said he'd be the first to donate if he were a woman. Dammit, I can't do it. I'm not even married! Newman can't get any donations due to recent bad press, so we got short end of the stick. Doctor. Truth aside, the informant's motive is being questioned, it'll be hard to continue. We gotta think about the public too. Continuing this could induce extreme hostility. A little more, just give me a little more time... The informant's credibility is gone, and they're reacting rapidly. A little time won't make any difference on our side. No amount of debating will change it. It's the right call to stop. Min-chul, will this be your last story? What of the informant then? He's ridiculed by the media, and became a public enemy. Do we just throw him to the curve? The least we can do for him is, give him a chance make his case and let the public decide. The person who should be validated is Dr. Lee, not the informant. All right. We all made our cases. Should we... take a vote? - Nay. - Nay as well. Nay. Min-chul. My opinion isn't all that different from the team. You can ignore the suits upstairs. If you're right, you can ignore their orders. But not your teammates. They raised valid reasons and you can't ignore that. The informant is one thing, but I gotta protect my team too. Let's weather the storm first. Goddammit... Dude! It's me. Dr. Lee asked me to do an interview. He told me to talk about you in front of the press. And I... will do it. I'll tell them how selfish and irresponsible you are. Then do it. I won't resent you. For our daughter I can do far worse. But before that, I have to ask you this. How can you be so certain about the stem cells? Answer me, I have to know. I was given an offer. What? Why are you telling me that now?! I only found out last night. This is insane... He was very close to a researcher named Do-hyung. An offer was made to him a month before publication. We can't end here, once is all I need. Please help me out. I'm sorry. Have I asked you for anything? I'll talk to Dr. Lee. No, please don't! Don't you know him by now? If not us, he'll find someone else and get what he wants. Do you think, you can survive in this field by going against him? Min-ho! Falsifying the thesis for Do-hyung's sake? As a scientist, this should never happen. You know that! If you continue down this road, I cannot work for you anymore. Do-hyung! Do-hyung! Do-hyung! Do-hyung! Do-hyung! If Dr. Lee's order cannot be verified, Do-hyung'd be blamed for everything, and even attempted suicide for that reason, so Shim was even more hesitant to come forward. He was bound by guilt. Are you writing a novel?! No... Hold on a sec. Let me think. Honey, I'm sorry. This is all my fault. I wanted to tell you, but I just couldn't bring him up. I'm so sorry to you and Su-bin. I'm sorry I couldn't tell you before. Min-chul! Where is Do-hyung now? Pittsburgh, USA, Dr. Simon's lab. Then go to Pittsburgh. I'll take all the heat, so go right now. Get Do-hyung's confession no matter what. For the story, and the informant, that's the best course of action. Authorized Personnel Only Screw you traitor! Go to hell! Goddamn you! Stop right there! Honey! Honey! - Su-bin! - Daddy! What's going on? Where are you going at this hour? USA, Pittsburgh. And you didn't bother to tell me? When will you be back? A few days, it won't be long. Mr. Yoon! Can't you let me in on what's going on? Hold on. Hello? What? Okay, I'll be right there. Okay. Let's talk after I get back. This is part of Dr. Lee's stem cell batch. He probably showed it to me to reassure me. I see. - Have it checked right away. - Sure. Hello? Have you arrived? Yeah. It must be nice to fly away during this mess. I'm hanging up. Wait, wait! I got the results from Mrs. Shim's sample. Yeah? What's the verdict? It does not match with the thesis. - Tada! - Okay! Aside from the Molly thesis, no new paper has arrived, and Dr. Lee's camp is quiet. They probably think we backed off. It's all over now. Far from it! We need solid evidence. The DNA does not match! Are you stupid? How will you present that? It's a stolen property! Do you think it's legally admissible? And send Mrs. Shim to jail? Don't get into trouble while I'm here and call if something's up. Got it! Let's do this right. Mr. Lee Do-hyung? Afternoon. I'm from NBS's PD Chase. I'm producer Yoon. I know the stem cell paper was fabricated. And that you're intimately involved. Could we speak privately? It's been hell, but I can't talk about it. Sorry for wasting your trip. Mr. Lee! If it was such an ordeal, this is your last chance. We have verifiable evidence that there is no stem cell, and Dr. Lee will be... investigated by the prosecution. If Dr. Lee denies the accusations, you'll be the scapegoat. So, for your own sake, please tell us the truth. Will he really be investigated? Once the story airs, he won't be able to avoid it. How did you get involved with the paper? As the publication date approached, Dr. Lee became very nervous, and pressured the researchers. He pressed Min-ho, but when that didn't work, he called me. Where did you obtain the sample for the thesis? We brought Newman's embryonic stem cells and lied that they were cloned cells. Because they're too similar to tell apart. And Dr. Lee ordered it directly? Right. Everything was ordered by Dr. Lee. I received the order myself. Shall we vote? - Aye. - Aye! - Aye! - Me too! Go for it? Aye! Let's do it! This is Lee Jang-hwan. Good afternoon. This is producer Yoon. We acquired evidence that the paper was faked. We could just air this story, but shouldn't we meet beforehand? We want to give you a chance to respond. Let me check my schedule. Certainly. Mrs. Shim is on a sick leave and her whereabouts are unknown. And her daughter was discharged. And Do-hyung? He's not in the lab and we lost contact. Call the station, let's do the interview. Sir? Limit their staff and it should be taped at our lab. I sent someone to Pittsburgh, why not wait a little bit? We can't delay any longer, let's face them head-on. Do-hyung... will break and come back to us soon. Doctor. They're here. Thank you for coming. Intro isn't necessary for our distinguished guests. They're awfully famous. Of course. It's an honor, gentlemen. Since we have guests, shall we start right away? As you like. Could you clarify the allegation that you're using illegally obtained oocytes and from your female staff? To start off, it's absolutely untrue about using oocytes from our staff. Let me tell you something. When one of my staff had difficulty obtaining oocytes, she insisted on using her own for the research, but I talked her down many times. I haven't looked into it since. I did not know Newman Medical provided us with illegal oocytes, I only heard they were leftovers from artificial insemination. When were 11 stem cells from the thesis developed from blastocyst phase? Well, this is something that happens routinely, and because of my heavy workload, I simply can't remember. Mr. Yoon. I'll try very hard to take note of everything. I didn't know I'd be scrutinized over every little detail. I promise you with them as witnesses. Sure. Who was in charge of verifying teratoma? That'd be professor Kang. Professor, could you elaborate? Well, sure. I verified teratoma with SCID mouse... One moment, sir. According to my research, your labs don't have SCID mice. Let's see here. Where are SCID mice grown? That'd be... a lab formerly used before... our veterinary school's relocation. Ah, that research lab... I see. We'll look into it at a later time. We've checked with various stem cell banks and patent offices, but couldn't find a single patent. We are always concerned about potential leaks during the patent phase... Let's move onto staining images. According to Lee Do-hyung, he was ordered to create images by faking Newman's embryonic stem cells as cloned stem cells. Is this true? I don't know how you threatened Lee to get that answer, but as researchers who deal with life, we have high ethics standards! You must have your own editorial code of conduct as well. If you used methods of coercion to fabricate a sensational story, you'll be responsible for your actions. To be clear, no methods of coercion were used during the interview. Shall we get back to the questions? - Lee claims he was ordered... - Wait a minute. Creating a stain is not a difficult task. Even with a colony, our junior researchers can do it. So you've never given such order to Lee? It's implausible! I don't know why he'd make such allegation, but it cannot happen. This is an allegation over something very trivial, a simple staining photograph, I simply cannot understand. Doctor, could I make a proposition? In order to eliminate all doubt, could you allow us to independently validate your stem cells? Of course, I'll certainly allow that. If we verify that cloned stem cells exist, we will not pursue this story any further. Sure. We'll provide you with 11 stem cell samples, and DNA of the somatic cell donor. Will you be okay with that? Of course. The tension in the room was unbearable. Oh, and I was right about the stem cell forgery. Fine, I wondered when you'd bring that up. Good job. But I'm rather miffed because he was way too relaxed. Here they are! Are you NBS's producer Yoon Min-chul? Hide your face! What's your agenda? 'Agenda'? - Have you interviewed Dr. Lee? - Move aside! Let us through! Give us a comment! Don't harass Dr. Lee! - No, we won't. - A comment! Grab her camera! Let go of it! Please stop! Why are they at fault? It is their job to look into suspicion. What are you waiting for? Escort them to their car! Out of the way! Stand back please. Are you okay? Please come this way. - You good? - Yeah. I am solely to be blamed. I'm sorry. - You haven't done anything wrong! - Please concentrate on your work! - We're here for you! - Be strong! We are on your side! - We'll support you till the end. - You have us! - We'll protect you! - We're on your side! Doctor. - PD Chase's producer Yoon... - What is it? - What? - He visited me in the Pittsburgh lab... - What is it? - And demanded an interview... Lee Do-hyung Press Conference Lee Do-hyung Press Conference insisting that the thesis was a fake. When I told him I couldn't bring myself to it, he threatened me that I'd be prosecuted, and in fear of such incrimination, I gave a false interview. Dammit! I'm here today because I'm afraid my interview may be accepted as the truth. Don't they know Dr. Lee is our nation's hope? Why are they trying to prevent him from getting us out of recession? You got that right! Why should a TV producer validate his work? That's what I'm saying! Immediately after Mr. Lee's press conference, media outlets are swarming the NBS station. PD Chase's online forumis... This is NBS. Producer Yoon isn't in. Assholes! Are you so hell-bent on seeing us go under? You should've stopped when we told you to! How could you let this happen?! No more of this. Send Yoon to the disciplinary board and halt the story immediately! Editorial decisions are up to the production department, you know that full well. You've crossed the line a long ago. The shit hits the fan because you pursued a story without evidence. We've concluded an interview with Dr. Lee, and validation of the stem cells have been agreed. They're manipulating the media because they're getting desperate! Lee Do-hyung was not held against his will. But this blew over due to false pretense! Only prosecution investigation was mentioned. An official apology would be sufficient, not a dismissal. Let the disciplinary board decide. This is the last warning, halt the story right away! Executive Restructuring Current Affairs Chief Kim Min-sik awaiting new position This is so frigging nuts. This proved to be a tougher nut to crack than we thought. How long do you think you'll last? Sung-ho will be next, and then you. You have to move fast now. Once we get the samples, it's all over. Just look around you! Do you think they'll actually allow DNA validation? They're ready to seal this once and for all. You'll hear from the disciplinary board, be ready. Okay. I am... solely to be blamed. In order to brush off all doubt, we will provide PD Chase with stem cell samples. I sincerely apologize for causing unnecessary concern. I will do my utmost to prevent further misunderstanding from happening. People of Korea, I am truly sorry. Protect our technology! Protect! Protect! As the scale of demonstration grows, PD Chase and producer Yoon are being heavily criticized for wanting to validate Dr. Lee's stem cells. Organized by online fans of Dr. Lee Jang-hwan, candlelight vigil is taking place near the city hall, and they demand the shut down of not only PD Chase but NBS entirely. As the situation escalates, another station criticized PD Chase and reports that stem cells do exist. - Reporter Park has the story. - What do we do? As was reported... STOP VALIDATION OF STEM CELLS! How much? As a fellow citizen, please don't do it. How will you repent for your sins? Abolish Editorial Manipulation! Overthrow PD Chase! Boss! Why aren't you answering your phone? What now?! Dr. Lee is waiting for you. What? Where? What brings you here? To this humble place. You report to work quite late. Yes, I leave late also since you gave me so much work. I'm sorry to hear that. I noticed that you're a fellow Hankuk University alum. Although we had different majors. I know you didn't come here to reminisce, why are you delaying what you've promised? We cannot continue to push airing of the story any further. Mr. Yoon. Give me 6 months, no, could you give me 3 months? Pardon? Within 3 months, I'll create over 30 stem cells. I'll give PD Chase the exclusive rights to tape the entire process. Are you asking me to make a deal with you? Deal... It's not a deal, I'm giving you a chance. So how about backing off now? I won't hold anything against you. Before this moment, before our conversation, I doubted my own conviction that there is no stem cell. Thank you for reaffirming me. If you continue, not only us, but the public will pay the price. This reckless quarrel does not help anyone. Let's put it behind us. Mr. Yoon, I'll do my best from here on. I'm asking you a favor as your senior. DNA test only takes 2 days, I simply cannot fathom why you need more time You failed to make even 1 in the past 5 year, how could you make 30 in 3 months? It's a pity to hear where you stand. I assure you, there will not be a validation. We will air it even without validation. Can you really? There's no way. Please look into labs that could help us. I'll somehow get embryonic stem cells from Newman. That's the only way now. Will it be possible? We can't just sit idly. I'll be back. What is it? I'm sorry, sir. My son wanted to tell you something. Sure. I... believe... in you... Be strong! Of course, I will. Don't cry... doctor. I'll be strong. Thank you doctor, thank you so much! I just want to talk to the department head! Why can't I meet him? This way please. I'm a current affairs producer, I'm not here to report or for an interview. I want to talk to him on a personal matter. Let go of me! - Let's talk outside! - Let me go! Hello? I'll do a press conference. What? No, you don't need to. You don't have any other way. I'll come forward. You can go public with my wife's sample if you need to. She told me to tell you. The two of us are ready to make any sacrifices. We're determined to see this through. No, you really don't have to. You've sacrificed enough, the rest is up to me. - But sir... - Don't you worry. I'll air the story no matter what. Trust me. I have my ways. Traitor to our nation... Disciplinary board made a decision. They'll withdraw the story and issue a public apology. It's all over now. Dude, for the first time ever, I'm scared of them. I thought the truth would bring them to our side. But it's not that easy. Goddammit! I'm gonna see this through! If that's their role, then this is ours, and the spirit of this program. Right? Yes, this is PD Chase. Is this NBS? Screw you, bitch! If you're done, I'm hanging up now. Screw your narrow-minded program! Screw yourself, you bastard! Pisses me off... Biotech Scientist Community We must look from all sides Why thesis validation is necessary This is what I want to see. Shouldn't we question everything? Hey, the Internet just exploded. What? They're going nuts over your forum post. My post? Everyone's sharing it. How to fake stem cell thesis image Everyone's sharing it. You actually did something good. You really are the ace! Can you tell them apart? You really are the ace! What are we doing in the middle of the night? Who the hell knows? He says it's important. It's about the stem cell thesis. He'll bring us a press release and wants us to write about it. A major scoop, ha! Weren't they supposed to issue a public apology and drop this? - I know, eh? - Of course not! He's got the evidence, apparently. He'll fill us in. - Whatever. - Who said? Good evening to you all! What took you so long? Thanks for waiting. Shall we begin? Hand these out. Read it carefully and I'll take any questions. Is this accurate? Dr. Lee does not have a single stem cell... Irresponsible media outlets played a role Suppression of the press, requesting reinstatement of PD Chase This is a petition signed by the faculty of Hankuk University. We express serious concern towards gagging of the press with PD Chase. If seeking the truth is suppressed in the name of national interest, this will ultimately damage it rather than protecting it. We demand the following: Dr. Lee Jang-hwan must come clean about the thesis to the public. The government must thoroughly investigate in pursuit of the truth. Mr. President wishes to have this matter settled here. Political influence would raise public outcry. Yoon Min-chul, right? He was in the student council in college. And your were a former head of union. It's an interesting combination. One-sided broadcast does not help national interest. One-sided? 'Impartial' is part of our motto. We have several enticing dirt on NBS. The truth is relative. I came too far, I should have stopped. Everyone looked up to me, I couldn't do it. When I gave them one, they demanded two. They always wanted more. I missed the chance to stop. I missed it. Dr. Lee was reported to have attempted suicide... Why attempt suicide with reporters on hand? How did they know where to go? Due to immense media scrutiny surrounding his thesis, he felt tremendous pressure... Iseul, don't worry, nothing will change. PD Chase Message Board - We aren't stupid! Air the story! - Screw the thesis, air it already! Public deserves the truth, broadcast the episode! It's replaced with another program, and we talked to the advertisers. This will blow over after today. Okay, thank you. The dailies went with it, so why the hell can we not?! Want a smoke? Goddammit! The execs gave enough thoughts too. The chairman saw the rough cut. What did he say? Pressure from various parties probably got to him. It's his damn job to cover us from it! Min-chul. - Let's get arrested. - What? Let's upload it online. If we get arrested, at least there'll be an investigation. I told my wife on my way here that today may be my last. Goddammit! Hey! Hey, where are you going?! Chairman, allow us to broadcast. Please? - Our job is to broadcast... - Let's get going. And the public decides. I'm begging you sir! Boss! The broadcast belongs to the public, and we deliver impartial, accurate, objective information! As per Constitutional and Broadcast Act, we have the editorial independence and this must be used in the interest of public alone, and must be fiercely upheld! With accurate and respectable programming, we are the curators of social and cultural issues, and we must shield ourselves from internal and external interferences! Chairman! - Let's do it. - Sir? - I'll watch it from home. - Yes, boss. Studio, are you ready? - Ready to go. - Okay. - Title, standby. - Standby. Sung-ho. Let's do this. Okay! Title, start! Start! Camera 1 standby. 1, cut! Camera 2 standby. Cut! MC cue! Good evening, I am PD Chase's Lee Sung-ho. Today, we'll look into Dr. Lee Jang-hwan's stem cell thesis fabrication issue, brought to us by a brave whistleblower. We've upheld all international science guidelines, including obtaining oocytes. But unlike such claim, we have acquired a shocking data that tells another story. This is the oocyte record from Dr. Lee's lab. Over 600 illegally obtained eggs were used in Dr. Lee's research. Anonymous donor (25) I was told it was for an infertile couple. Anonymous donor (25) If I had known of the side effects, I wouldn't have done it. Gynecology clinic doctor Stimulating the eggs to multiply them is very dangerous. Gynecology clinic doctor Heavy blood loss could lead to death, as well as sterility and cancer, so informing the risks to the donors is crucial. Even more shocking is the truth behind images of 1 1 stem cells in the thesis. Not only were these images fabricated, according to one researcher, 5 of them, which supposedly came from different stem cells, all came from the same source. In particular, stem cell #5 is identical to an embryonic stem cell by Newman Medical, which was published in a science journal last October. We interviewed a researcher who was involved in the process. Everything was ordered by Dr. Lee. I received the order myself. Tomorrow Daily Chief Minister Yoon NIS Director Kim There's no telling what a stem cell will become. It could be a heart, bone marrow or a tumor. I joined Dr. Lee's research team in order to save my child and many others... But when I found out that he was creating false hope It was too hard to bear. I wanted to be a proud dad to my child. Due to public outcry concerning our investigation, we, here at PD Chase, had a soul searching. Ladies and gentlemen, we believe that media exists for justice and truth. And this is the reason why we refused to give up till the end. Now, it is up to you to decide what is the truth. What say you? Thank you for watching. Credits, roll! Ace! Good work! Sung-ho, great show! You did all the heavy lifting. Good job! - Good work. - Thank you. Thank you so much for your help. Controversies surrounding Dr. Lee were aired tonight. What is this bullshit?! They said incurable diseases could be cured soon. And how stem cells could help our economy. So it was all a con! Ain't it? Indeed. It's hard to believe because it's none other than Dr. Lee. But it's not like the producer made everything up. - Don't you think? - I agree. I don't care about other programs, but I trust PD Chase. I see. It was them who revealed those lying douchebag politicians. If I had some money, I'd leave this damn country. Welcome back, chief! Congratulations! Screw you both. I'm not a mover, packing and unpacking boxes. At least you got a nice vacation thanks to us. It's nice to be back though. What the heck is that? Hands off! Share the goods! This is producer Yoon. What? Where? Yes. May I call you back in a bit? Call who back? Don't stir anything up. Just don't! What is it? Do I need to pack again? No, it's nothing like that. We went through so much, I have conscience too. Answer me straight, should I pack or not? I'll treat you to a nice lunch. Pack or not?! Hey! Hello, this is producer Yoon. Of course, your anonymity will be protected no matter what. Shall we talk in person? Where should we meet? Yes, I know. I understand, see you soon.
