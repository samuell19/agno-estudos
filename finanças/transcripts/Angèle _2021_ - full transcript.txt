A NETFLIX ORIGINAL DOCUMENTARY Angèle, Angèle, Angèle... Angèle... It happened so fast. And it was so intense. Angèle, will you marry me? It feels good to put it into words. DIARY I'M SUFFOCATING FAKE SUCCESS? To be able to tell the story the way I experienced it. Damn. I always look terrible whenever I use this camera. And no one will ever be able to tell it better than I can. No one's ever ready for this. When I ended up being on every show overnight, I was super happy... but I also thought, "Why am I here? Why me?" So I created this girl. An improved version of myself. A combination of my fantasies. The Little Mermaid. A princess. Hélène Ségara. Priscilla. Ariana Grande. All those I secretly wished I looked like. Here's the thing... I have lost the real Angèle. LOST I don't know who I am. WHO I AM 1. WHO IS ANGÈLE? BRUSSELS, BELGIUM Citizens are to stay at home in order to avoid any kind of physical contact... ...outside their close family circle. All gatherings are forbidden. Lockdown, day one. Today is March 14, 2020. Not sure what the weeks to come will look like. ♪ We're under lockdown ♪ Since I have nothing to do, I'm experimenting. Lockdown, day five. I feel like it's been two years since I last wrote something. Today is March 19. This will take for-fucking-ever. I'm sick of being under... lock... down. At first, I didn't want to make music. I told myself, "I shouldn't be working. I'm on a break." I've built a kind of shelter for myself. With a hi-fi system and everything. The DIY way. And that's when I wrote a lot of stuff. Hey! Why does it sound like this? Why is it so saturated? BRUSSELS ILY APRIL 20, 2020 I started thinking about another album during lockdown. I hadn't before. I was busy touring, promoting myself. I had no other choice but to tell myself, "Okay. What do we do now?" I was lucky that my first album became a success. But I was 20 when I wrote it. Now I'm 25. My life has changed a lot in five years. I've experienced a lot. I can't keep singing about the same things. I don't like it. It's annoying. I'm expected to be as successful. It's natural to feel pressure, but I think I'll go someplace else and try something more personal. But I don't know where it'll take me. WHO IS ANGÈLE? I forgot what it was like to be on my own with my piano. Asking questions like, "What do I want to talk about?" "What do I really care about now?" LOCKDOWN - DAY 36 ♪ One time Never give it up ♪ ♪ Two times ♪ ♪ For all the love I got ♪ ♪ Three for you ♪ ♪ Where are you? ♪ If the pandemic hadn't happened, I probably would have been traveling, partying... I wouldn't have confronted these fears in such a direct way had I been able to avoid them. Pepette. The chamber of secrets. I have so much brol. BROL - MASCULINE MESS, CHAOS I mean, real brol. We might have the notebook of secrets. I don't have my notebook? Pepette is stuck. ♪ Why did you write ♪ ♪ Everything down in notebooks ♪ ♪ Of secrets ♪ Ah! One notebook of secrets. ONE LIFE WHO IS ANGÈLE? I write a lot because I need to... write. That's why I write songs. I've always written in diaries. I have so many of them. This is really the beginning. I didn't have any songs yet. It's crazy how much lousy stuff I wrote. I used to write such awful lyrics. "Online and connected, but not to me. Waiting for a sign." The first lyrics to "Je veux tes yeux." The top-line was different. ♪ Online and connected, but not to me Waiting for a sign, there's none ♪ ♪ Online and connected, but not to me Waiting for a sign, there's none ♪ Good thing I changed the top-line. WRITTEN AT 23 "It's late. I'm in my Paris apartment. I feel like reading old notes." "Don't know who I am anymore." WHO I AM "I work more than I breathe, and I'm suffocating." I'M SUFFOCATING "What makes me happy? Success?" "The 350,000 followers?" "The ten million views on 'La loi de Murphy?'" "What makes me happy is fake." "Me, my image. Nailing it. Me, myself, and the singer Angèle." "Everything else is pointless. I'm ashamed of it." "I feel a void when I get home because I realize that this is all pointless, fake, impalpable." "I used to be alive. Full of doubts, questions, desires." "Now success is my only desire." "I run away from everything else. I used to be free." There you go. Crazy, huh? I USED TO BE FREE At the same time, I wouldn't trade my life for my old one. Even if I could. Because what's happening to me is beautiful, and wanted. And I worked hard for it. It's what I've always wanted.

Hi, Mom. We could meet on Sunday night. Yes, I'll be there. We'll have fries, for a change. - Take care. See you on Sunday. - I love you, Mom. - I love you, dear. Bye. - Yeah. Bye. Look. When I was a kid, this was a tower. That was like the World Trade Center to me. I never knew what it was for. That was my elementary school. We're going back to see my school. Oh, it's amazing to be here. To find myself here. Crocodiles! I must've spent five years of my life waiting for the bus here. My parents used to be a bit late. So we're arriving in Linkebeek. I put a sweater on Pepette so we'll match, 'cause I'm crazy. She's too cute. I find it so beautiful here. You get bored very quickly though. We're literally in the middle of nowhere. That's home. Let's go see Granny. Pepette! My little darling. Hey, how's it going? I'm filming. Hello, you cutie. Hey. Have you seen the stuff there? Yo! She's Laurence Bibot and you are Angèle Van Laeken. Yeah! Oh! - How are you? - Yes, very well. Is that Spritz? No, that's grenadine. Angèle? - What? - How are you? Yes, I'm fine. WRITTEN AT 13 "I'm young. I have amazing friends." "I love my school. My parents, my brother are great." "I love music, I love parties." "I love piano." "I love candy." "Playing, screaming, dancing. Dancing like no one's watching." "I love singing. Old American movies." "I love Audrey Hepburn." "If I were to keep explaining why I'm happy today, for no reason I'm going to start crying. Yes." "That's real life." - All the shows. - That's funny. The good old days. "Bravo, Martine." October 26, 1996. I was one year old. Less than that. She was on stage when I was ten months old. That's the time you had... - When I fainted? - You had a breath-holding spell. Right. That was the start of you asserting your shitty temper. Exactly. But look at me today. Look at that, honey. Look. Baby. You're the newborn, miss, aren't you? Who's that, Roméo? Your little sister, what's her name? Angelo. No, Angèle. - Yes, Angèle. - She's not a boy. Names have a story for us. With Roméo, we went quite far already. We picked Roméo... Johnny. Always good. Elvis. And Kiki. When I fell pregnant, I didn't know the gender. Though I believed it'd be a girl. That's what I wanted. So, yes, I wanted to go for legendary names again. I was thinking about the women that made history. Cleopatra was a little too much. Joséphine would've been the middle name because of Joséphine Baker. We decided... No, "I decided." That'd be more honest. I went for Angèle. She was an amazing toddler. A gorgeous little girl. She never had an awkward phase. I did some modeling. Uh, I saw some very beautiful girls. And I saw how sad they were. I thought, "That's strange." "Is beauty more of a curse than a blessing?" So I told Angèle, when she was four or five, "Listen. You're very pretty." We were in the car. "You're very pretty." Hmm. "But that won't be enough." "You're pretty. We know. But work on something else." THE MOTHER "You seen your mother?" But it goes out the other way. Know what he said? "Go wash your butt, you slut." Laurence Bibot, also known as Marinette. I grew up with famous parents. My mother is an actress. My father is a singer. So fame, to me, has always been something I knew about. It wasn't new. Both my parents were artists. They were very creative. They were on stage, in the spotlights. They were inspiring, funny. They knew how to take up space. Maybe too much sometimes. My brother and I were lucky to experience this. And even though they were only popular in Belgium, and their success was modest, we still felt like we grew up in their shadow. DIARY CAUTION NARCISSISTIC PERSON..; PLEASE DO NOT TAKE THIS BIG FLAW INTO CONSIDERATION Wait, look. That's interesting. A bit sad. "Every time I mention my parents, people can't help but mention their job." "'You listen to him on the radio? Is your mom still funny?'" "'Do your parents record themselves off TV?'" "'I saw your mom on TV. She rocks.'" "I don't care." "I'm... currently... saying... they're impossible." "People don't see me. I'm just 'the daughter of.'" Crazy. May 1, 2011. I'M JUST "THE DAUGHTER OF" Shh! Go play out there. The kids suffered from our fame. We didn't realize that. They were "the son and daughter of." When we were running errands at the supermarket or whatever, people would come up to us. For the kids, I... They once told us it wasn't always easy. We didn't realize it. We do now. Now that it's the other way around. We're no longer... Sometimes, I... I'm just "the father of." THE FATHER OF Brussels is coming! It must have been something for my father. A "wow" feeling. Just like me when I saw my sister nailing it while I was in it too, making a name for myself. Imagine what it's like for my dad. He's almost 60. And his kids... Let's start with me. I was doing my thing. He was like, "What?!" It blew his mind. "How many views this week?" I said, "10,000 views." "That's crazy." He was shocked. THE RAPPER BROTHER SISTER OF DAUGHTER OF They became "the parents of." That's crazy. They became the parents of. I still spend time apologizing for being here. But... I was just looking for recognition as a person, as an individual, independent of my parents. Good. Hold on, I'm not sure. When I was playing music, I could feel I was worth something. I had something to say. Fortunately, Ania, my piano teacher, saw that I had something right away. So she encouraged me. People would ask who was playing the piano. "Angèle is." I could feel I was worthy again. That made me feel valuable. But I couldn't play in my room by myself. If people were too busy, I couldn't play too loud. I couldn't sing too loud. I didn't want to draw attention. So I also learned how to play softly and sing very softly. That's good. My father was demanding since that was his job. If I played piano, he'd often say, "You need to work on it more." He would think I wasn't diligent enough. La... La... Re... Let's do it together. We couldn't play just like that... It wasn't just a hobby. "Why is my father so, one, annoying?" "Two, why does he want me to be a professional musician?" "Just because it's his job doesn't mean it should be mine." Go on. "'Music requires way more work.'" "Well, I'm sorry, Marka. I don't like music as much as you do." "I love piano. I do. But it'll never be my job." "I love piano. I do." "But it'll never be my job." You read that right. "It'll never be my job." Crazy. MY PLACE BRUSSELS 2 FIRST VERSE OK ♪ I owe my name to you ♪ ♪ Brussels, I love you Brussels, I love you ♪ ♪ I missed you ♪ Damn. That's it. It's not that hard. BRUSSELS ILY The lockdown wasn't easy. Not for anyone. I lived in different places. I was stuck in Paris for a while. Fuck! Two. Is it interesting? Hold on. I love Paris. It's beautiful. There's everything you need. But it's not home. I wanted to write a love letter to the city in which I grew up. ♪ Brussels, I love you ♪ ♪ Brussels, I love you You're my favorite ♪ ♪ Brussels, I love you Brussels, I love you ♪ It's those little things, simple and personal things, that governed the second album. It might not be as universal as the first one. It's not going to change the world, but it's sincere and close to who I am. Well, I think so. I think that making music for me, since it was my dad's job, it was hard to keep it just a hobby. At the same time, I didn't want it to become professional. I was stuck in-between. I could tell I was talented and that I liked it, but I didn't want to push it further. I didn't want to do my dad's job. I thought it was a difficult job. Even harmful to his mental health. That's how I'd sum it up. DANCE IDEA I was really against smartphones. I had a Nokia. I didn't have Snapchat or Instagram. Just Facebook, period. A good friend of mine told me, "You're going to love Instagram." I was like, "Me, love it?" I said, "No, thanks. I'm not interested in drawing that attention." So I signed up to Instagram. Since I was studying music, I thought I could use it to make music. ♪ There's just one thing That's getting in the way ♪ ♪ You know I hate sleeping alone ♪ ♪ Killing me softly with his song ♪ ♪ Killing me softly ♪ Then I started singing and recording videos. To avoid criticism, I was making jokes. It was easier to laugh about it, to put costumes on, to just make funny faces. It let people know I wasn't taking myself seriously. Thanks, bye. I'm not confident, but I have no followers, so there's nothing at stake. Only my friend who signed me up. A few friends. Some of them find out I sing. They're surprised. My childhood friends find out I sing. But that was it at first. I remember very well a few of the first reactions I got. I remember Sylvie's. I CALL SHOTGUN ON THE MANAGER POSITION! I know Angèle well, yes. I have known her for 21 years. Yeah. We attended the same school. We lived close to each other. I used to look after Angèle's class in kindergarten. When I was 16, I babysat her. When I wasn't old enough, her parents would drop her at mine when on tour. The first time I saw Angèle on Instagram, I think it was her first video. I posted a comment as a joke. I said, "Shotgun on the manager position." That's it. At that time, I knew she was just having fun. But she could sing. She had personality. There was something. It wasn't my job but I thought, "Why not give it a try?" I was thirsty for projects back then. I wanted to do lots of things. I felt that Angèle had huge potential. I did make her leave her room to perform in bars. She was quite hesitant. "What are we doing?" I'd say, "Close your eyes. Trust me." We started off like this. Give me the tape. I'm sending the video to myself. Sylvie, what's it like to hang out with someone eight years younger? It makes me feel so mature. I'm always on my knees. Angèle soon nicknamed me "Daring Sylvie." It does suit me well. Angèle is the scared one. She doesn't dare to do things. I want to smash doors open. So, yeah. "Daring Sylvie" it is then. Nice to meet you. DARING SYLVIE THE MANAGER MARCH 7, 2016 I was where I was supposed to be. I felt good. I thought, "Music is my place." But I was so scared of failure! With a singer as a father, an actress as a mother, I felt the need to prove that I wasn't the little girl. But I didn't talk about it with them because... I didn't want their help or, even less, to draw their interest because I'd be ashamed if I failed. Sylvie believed in it. She'd say, "It'll be amazing." I didn't believe at all. Sylvie was already thinking about shows at the Archiduc, a famous jazz bar in Brussels. I was studying jazz music. I was having a hard time fitting in. Asking myself if I deserved it. I was still learning. I did that show, and it was sold out. I met Nicolas, my second manager, there. It would have been impossible without Sylvie. Sylvie got me out of my room. She got me out of my family home. I FUCKING LOVE MY LIFE FUCK EXCITEMENT OF THE DAY Nicolas got a call. Damso's team were looking for someone to play keyboards. And, uh, I'm not sure by what miraculous chance my name was mentioned as a possibility. I also don't know by what chance it came to me opening the show. I got a call from Damso's tour producer, asking if Angèle was interested in playing keyboards on Damso's tour. That was a surprising request. "That would be cool, but can't she open the show too?" I didn't realize what I was saying as I said it. I wasn't visualizing what it'd be like to have her open for Damso. With his audience. It turns out Damso didn't want a rapper to open the show. He didn't know my songs because they hadn't been released. He hadn't heard any of my songs. He'd only heard my piano cover of "Bruxelles." ♪ Brussels, my beautiful ♪ ♪ I'll meet you soon ♪ ♪ As soon as Paris... ♪ He thought that cover was great. And he thought, "All right. It's going to work out." Damso, at the time, he had a huge influence. And everything he touched could potentially turn to gold. When she asked me, even with how much I loved Damso, I said, "No, you're insane." "His audience isn't ready. They won't give you a chance," blah, blah. DRESSING ROOM - ANGÈLE I'm offered this improbable thing, even though at the time I wasn't into rap music. I was into the whole jazz thing. I was starting music, but I wasn't into that. "Why me? What does it have to do with me?" And "what do I have to lose?" It was a real debate. My mother said, "Go for it. Nothing to lose." That was true. At that time, I didn't. FIRST SHOW Come on! I'm backstage. I hear that the crowd is already psyched up. The lights go off. Back on and I walk on stage. I get booed straightaway. 2,000 people booing. They're booing me as if I wasn't welcome there at all. I remember I took my phone out to film. I can hear people starting to scream. We realize that people are not enjoying themselves. They're booing. Like... They're calling her names. We were like, "Fuck." Nico and I looked at each other and said, "What were we thinking?" "Why did we do that?" "We're going to destroy her. Her confidence will be crushed." Damso walks in. He hadn't seen anything. People start cheering him. I'm playing like... Thinking, "What the hell was that?" I think... it was tough. I didn't realize. I was doing my thing. Later on, I learned that it had been touchy. Give it up for Angèle. They thought I was crazy for doing this... If I like someone, I go for it. It came naturally. I didn't think, "I'm gonna break the codes." I'm not breaking any codes, I'm just going for someone who... I like their soul and energy. So let's just do it. See? I posted something on Instagram, asking people to support her. Because it's hard indeed. YOU CAN'T SEE HER WELL BUT SHE'S GOING TO NAIL IT We're headed home. The mood is quite low. Sylvie falls asleep. I'm in bed, staring at the ceiling. I can still hear people shouting. "Is it going to be like this for three months?" I start thinking, "How am I going to handle it?" I don't want to see it as a failure. That would be the worst for me. At the same time, I don't know how to avoid having to face such vehemence. To face an audience who doesn't want me there. SECOND SHOW How do you feel? The usual. I'm nervous. But it needs to be done. - What'd you do before arriving? - I pooped. She's a bit tired. Where's Angèle? Oh, she's here. I get on stage. Not sure what was going through my head then, but I started to feel determined. At least, it felt like it. Deep down, I wasn't confident at all. I thought, "Let's do it another way." I don't want to give people the chance to let me know they're unhappy. Let's go. Good evening! How are you? Are you ready? My name's Angèle. I'm glad to be here tonight. Thank you, Damso, for inviting me. They're happy. They're happy. Angèle! ♪ One time ♪ ♪ Two times ♪ ♪ Three for you ♪ Against all odds, people just started saying my name. Just shouting my name. - Angèle! Go Angèle! - Yes! It was a bit of a joke too, because people didn't expect to see me on stage, so it needed to become a joke. We were complete opposites, so it was just funny to do that. I think I managed to make the most of this absurdity. He had nothing to gain from supporting me, giving me visibility. He did it for the love of music. Because he loved what I was doing. What's crazy is that it continued later on. We're working on new projects. It's great that we've made this thing last. I learned a lot with him at the time that helped me afterwards. I was more driven after that. I also felt like I've always had to prove something when I was on stage. Suddenly, I couldn't do anything but just own up to it. No cheating. And no seeking to please. ♪ One time Never give it up ♪ ♪ Two times, for all the love I got ♪ ♪ Three for you ♪ I started writing on my own. From then on, I started to feel more fulfilled with my music because it felt like me. I'd think of something and I knew how to make it. This young woman is going viral among both French and Flemish speakers. Her name is Angèle. Her song's called "La loi de Murphy." Angèle, "La loi de Murphy." A crazy live set. My God. ♪ One time Never give it up ♪ What happened was great. I couldn't have imagined it would work out this fast. We knew nothing about how to promote an album. We didn't plan anything. We weren't ready at all. We put the video on YouTube. I had no record label. I didn't have a lot of resources. We were independent. And millions of people reacted to it. And I saw this happen from my small Brussels apartment. I don't know what's going on. I see the comments. I can feel it becoming a thing. I think to myself, "I may have made a huge mistake." "It may be getting out of hand." HAPPY? HAPPY? I'm very scared, because e-mails... At what time did I send this? Okay. 5:20 p.m. "Hi, Sylvie and Nicolas. I'd like to apologize for my crisis." "I know you're working hard. I don't want to blame you for my fears." I could have sent this anytime. "You both need to know who I really am." "On stage, I try to put on a front." "I'm doing it because this is a huge opportunity." "It opens doors." "All of this is amazing." "But this is for the ANGÈLE project." All caps. "When I say I can't complain, it's true." "It wouldn't make sense to do so when we couldn't have hoped for better." "But how come I haven't been able to sleep for a month and that I've been having panic attacks and crying five times a day?" "I'm just sensitive and anxious." "I can't separate the personal from the professional." "The project's called Angèle. I need to face the consequences." "What's happening scares me." "I think no one knows because it's too amazing to be scary." "But since last Monday, my real face is on YouTube." "It's really me. I wanted that too." "I'm starting to look back on everything that's happened." "I'm starting to get messages and offers." "I have to face that alone." "If it doesn't work out, that would've been my failure." "In short, I don't want to be a diva, saying no one can understand me, but I mean what I'm saying." "I'm freaking out. I'm having panic attacks again." "I know it's not going to change and might get even worse, but if you could understand where this is coming from, it'd be great." "I want to thank you for what you're doing." "I don't say it enough. I mean it." Wow. That's crazy. Well... That's crazy because I could have written this a week ago. And, well, that's reassuring. I'm true to myself. At the same time, it's reminiscent of a strange period. It's true that when "La loi de Murphy" came out, I wasn't having a good time. Yet, it was the beginning of everything. There was this moment when I was very untroubled, very, um... free. I was doing music, but I could go out. I could party with my friends, while still doing music. I was having a blast. But then, suddenly, the song is released. People react to it. I get the first messages and reviews. So, all of a sudden, I have to face something violent. You get direct feedback from millions of people. At home, by myself wearing pajamas. Greasy hair, dirty teeth. You're facing your screen, and you see thousands of views, and thousands of people all around you. You're paranoid. The day "La loi de Murphy" came out, I was feeling paranoid. I felt like everyone was watching me. Even though no one cared. I just kept crying after that. I'd cry all day at that time. I was scared! I thought, "What am I getting into?" Maybe I was that scared because, deep down, I knew that I wouldn't let this go, that it was what I had wished for. Because I wanted this to happen, but there was a part of me that was like, "Oh, geez! What's going to happen?" ANGÈLE, HEAVEN-SENT ANTI-MUSE Playboy gets in touch. They want to improve their image. I know about the magazine. They want to feature a portrait of me. They explain that the next issue of their magazine will be focusing on feminism, on women's voices. And it won't be sexual. I hesitate a bit, but end up accepting because it could be interesting to talk about my music in this magazine. It's at odds with what they do and maybe... And things may change. I did the interview, it went well. The day I saw the magazine, I was surprised at first, because I thought the portrait they painted was quite inaccurate. What's more, right away, the photo that they chose... We had shot it a few months earlier, very innocently. We had decided not to publish it because as I was young, blonde, with red lips, and I was pouting, we thought it was too seductive. And I was already scared at that time to be sexualized against my will. I wasn't comfortable with that picture. It wasn't the right time. They were really interested in this picture, but I had forbidden them to use it. I knew it'd be misinterpreted. I discover when I open the magazine that they used it even though I had said no. The real trauma was the day after. Belgian tabloids publish this picture too and with the title, "Daughter of Marka and Laurence Bibot poses naked in Playboy." All my fears combined. FIRST COPY OUT SATURDAY That is to say, being "the daughter of, the sister of," and in a sexual context. ROMÉO ELVIS' LITTLE SISTER My worst nightmare. I felt humiliated. At that time, I was just starting to get confident. I had started my own record label, my publishing company. I was independent. No longer living with my family. I had managed to do it on my own. Write and play songs... I was really starting to tell myself I could do it on my own. With that first article, it came down to, "No, you're just a girl." A pretty blonde, who takes her clothes off for men as the only way to get noticed. VOICE MESSAGE SEPTEMBER 30, 2017 I'm sorry, yesterday... in one of those magazines, they wrote the worst things about me in my life. "Laurence Bibot's and Marka's daughter naked for Playboy magazine." I saw that and I cried all day. I can't get over it. Looks like there's nothing I can do. The world is an awful place where people want to sell me and they use my image... I'm 21. I spend my life trying to send good messages to people, write beautiful love songs... I'm very careful about what I do, what I show, and I want to be natural. I hate this superficial world where girls are sexual objects. Now it's getting out of hand. I get caught in it. The worst headlines with my parents involved. It's a public humiliation. I don't feel well. I don't want to play. I don't want to do anything anymore. After that came months of total control of my image. I was very affected by this event. But I also felt determined afterwards. I thought I would never be "the sister of, the daughter of" again. That's not who I am. I'm someone. I work too hard to be associated with this. What affected me was to realize that even today, even if it wasn't the image I wanted, though that could've been the case, a girl posing like that was seen as a negative. That she should be ashamed. That it deserved to be in the papers. ♪ Everyone only wants dough ♪ ♪ That's the only thing That makes them hard ♪ ♪ Everyone only wants fame ♪ ♪ That's the only thing that moves them ♪ ♪ What's the point then? ♪ ♪ You're so lonely behind your screen ♪ ♪ Thinking about what people will think ♪ ♪ But they don't seem to care ♪ It feels so weird to think that all these cars are for me.

But... - Angèle, will you marry me? - You're beautiful! Angèle! - I'm so sorry. Thank you. - Angèle! When will you be back? No one behaves normally with me. No... No relationship is normal anymore. I remember this one festival. We got off stage. Lots of people wanted to take a picture with me. It wasn't the right time. Unfortunately, I can't really lie. I'm spontaneous. So if I'm sad, angry, or not feeling well, I can't pretend and put on a fake smile. I said to the girls, "I can't go and see them." People started to call me names. They completely lost it. I remember one woman with her kids, who shouted, "Come on, grab her hair!" The kids started pulling my hair. I looked down, and someone else said, "You're a shitty star." And... Yeah, I do remember not understanding how we got to this point. Thinking, "What am I for them?" "Am I just a star?" Yes, I am. They don't know me. They don't know I am a human being. After that show, I'm going to poo like everyone else. To them, I'm just a star. So if they don't get a picture with me, it's disrespectful. And in a way, when you do music and you become famous, there's something tacit about it. Now you belong to people.

Why would I do it for Cannes? I'm all dressed up, but I don't want to have to do that. I don't feel the need to shave. Why would I do it? I know I'll be lashed out at. I don't want that either. I don't want it to be about that. I want people to talk about my performance. Not about my outfit or my armpit hair. Angèle! Down here! Angèle!

YOU'LL NEVER HAVE OUR SILENCE AGAIN ...after a guy bothered me in Brussels. ENOUGH WITH RAPE Women's voices were starting to be heard and artists were committed to changing things. I didn't think I had the legitimacy to say anything about it, but I understood that I had a voice. People recognized themselves in this. FROM BEYONCÉ TO ANGÈLE FEMINISM GOES POP FEMINIST AND POP ICON IN THE NY TIMES POST-#METOO FEMINIST ANTHEM HOW DID IT BECOME A FEMINIST ANTHEM? Is it clear for everyone? When a girl says no, I feel like most of the time, it means... It means no. No. Okay. It's great if the song made people aware there are issues to tackle. But it spun out of control. Even though I completely agreed with the claims and I'm still committed today, I'm not sure that this was what I wanted. Being that exposed. Some people might see me as a know-it-all. People would come up with things to blame me for. Focus on Roméo Elvis. He's involved in a case of sexual assault. The singer was accused on Instagram and he apologized. He said he used his hands in an inappropriate way. He thought he was replying to an invitation. As for the singer Angèle, his sister, she was asked to snitch on her brother on social media. SNITCH ON YOUR BROTHER #SNITCHONYOURPIGBROTHER SNITCH YOUR ROMEO ANGÈLE ACCOMPLICE SILENCE MEANS AGREEMENT SHOE'S ON THE OTHER FOOT EDUCATE YOUR BROTHER PLZ YOU DAMN FEMINIST GO JOIN YOUR BROTHER I barely left my house for three months. It was an explosion in my heart, in my family. Because just like anyone else, I condemn what my brother did, obviously. It was so violent and saddening to realize how much some people rejoiced over it. Me, a feminist who spoke out, as if I was responsible. As if I had to pay too. As if it wasn't hard enough already to hear about this, and to see my brother in this situation. No. On Twitter, people were asking me to react right away. Otherwise, the battle I had been fighting would lose credibility. I CONDEMN IT'S ALL THE MORE IMPORTANT SINCE HE'S A RELATIVE THERE NEEDS TO BE A CHANGE OF MINDSET Sexist and sexual violence is so omnipresent that sometimes I feel like we'll never make it. Then I look around and I realize that people can slowly evolve. People can be aware of all this. My song isn't going to change things, but people growing more aware and speaking out will. Be it my brother, my best friend, my colleague... I'll always condemn what goes against my beliefs. The way women are being treated and the way we teach men how to behave with them must change. SHE SHE Oh, good Lord... She's great there too. Besides, I never would have thought... that she would have done... - Is it modeling? - Yes. Oh. My darling... If your grandpa was still here, he'd be proud. She's fantastic... What a beautiful kid. She's a real model, huh? You're the first to see these. - Really? - Yeah. Ah, Granny Pilou is not just anyone. For sure. GRANNY PILOU THE GRANDMOTHER Granny Pilou is my grandmother. I'm very, very close to her. She lives in a different world from mine. She brings me back down to Earth because she thinks my job is amazing, but she doesn't understand it. Even though I did these things, I'll always stay her granddaughter. It allows her to stay simple and, most importantly, honest with me. Tell me, Granny, which do you prefer? Lemon or sugar? Lemon or sugar tart? - Sugar. - Okay! No. This won't do here, honey. Yes. Put the cans away. What do you think of my style, Granny? Well, it's a little special. I don't really like it. At least you're being honest. - Yes. - You asked what I think. Yes, at least you're honest. It's hard. Dating back to the war... 24 YEARS OLD "I really want to write." "I'm getting used to not understanding my life, but this time, that was unexpected." "Even though I had thought about it before, several times even." SHE SHE SHE IN LOVE Angèle is the new big star. Tomorrow, her new relationship will be disclosed. So, you'll see in the video. Look at it closely. We can't show just the picture. Okay? So, look closely. Tomorrow's cover. SHE'S FOUND LOVE AGAIN LEAVING THE RESTAURANT ARM IN ARM ISN'T LIFE GREAT? She... She... She said, "Don't tell Granny." "I'll tell her." One night, she called me. I knew already. And, well, I was a little bit... abrupt in the way I talked, probably. She said, "Granny, how are you doing?" "I'm fine." Well, I'm starting to... She said, "What's going on?" "Nothing," I said. "I need to tell you something." I said, "No. You don't." "I know." That's it. The guy actually outed me. He was the first person to say on the air that I was with a woman even though it was complicated for me to grasp it, to consider it. It was intimate. He did it, even though... I mean, it could have, um, caused problems in my family. She would have liked to give me more... How should I put it? More of an explanation about it. I've always asked, "Why a woman?" "Why a man?" she replied. It may be because of my age. There are so few LGBT role models that I realized quite late that I was bi. I was 23. I couldn't keep lying to myself. With my situation, I didn't just have to face my family, their questions, the fear of being rejected, I also had to face the public's opinion. SHIT SHE'S A LESBIAN REPORT ME BUT I REALLY THINK IT'S A DISEASE SELL-OUT EAT YOUR FUCKING RAINBOW YUCK I'LL UNFOLLOW The issue is my coming out was stolen from me. While it's great that young people can relate to gay public figures, I would have liked to decide on the time and the way to do it. There's a reason why people are scared of coming out. Consequences can be brutal. All that matters to me now is that falling in love can be normalized. No matter the gender. A public figure's sexual orientation shouldn't be headline news. It should be a fact, normal. When I was 15 or 16, I would've liked to have more LGBT role models. That way, I wouldn't have lied to myself. Thinking of this calms me down.

I always look terrible whenever I use this camera. Maybe the hair. So the other day, I made... I'm making tea. It's noisy. I made Laetitia listen to the songs. She's a friend. My press secretary in Belgium. I made her listen to the songs. All good, and she's like, "Not sure about the lyrics." "Compared to Brol, I feel excluded." "I feel like this isn't as good." That's not what she said, but she felt frustrated because on Brol, all the subjects that I tackled were much more universal. It spoke to anyone. This is more introspective. That's true. I've experienced other things since Brol came out. Not necessarily music-related. And, um, I've grown up. I'm more of an adult. And I'm more... I'm more ready to talk about serious matters. I don't know. I'm getting worked up. Plus, I think I'm going round in circles music-wise. And... It's annoying me because I feel like I can't do anything. This video is useless. I'm sorry. This is what happens when I make music. I never finish my sentences because I talk to myself like an old crazy person. And... I'm going back and forth to make tea. I have doubts about everything I write or create. I feel like a loser. That's what happens. LONDON NOVEMBER 28 2020 - Little rascal! - Yay! Dua! - Yay! - How are you? - It's so good to see you. How you doing? - I'm fine. Hi, my dear. - How are you? I'm good. How are you? - Good. Not too tired. I ended up being part of a pop star's project. I was able to observe, like a fly on the wall, how it worked from the inside. On the one hand, I was impressed to see who this absolutely amazing woman was. She was talented and she was approachable. Much more than I thought. It was reassuring because I realized you could be a big pop star and be approachable.

Because this is really next-level. I thought to myself, "What am I actually doing here?" I asked myself that. Honestly. Really. The girl sings, dances... I mean, she's a beast. I just thought, "I'm not as good at all." "I'm going to head home." Where's Linkebeek? Oh, my God, it's gonna be amazing! So excited, so excited. I'm not sure this is what I want for me. Something that big. But the energy, the ambition, the craziness even... Not being afraid... It's inspired me for what's next. What's next for me. BRUSSELS, ILY FINAL One, two, three!

I'm actually quite superstitious. I didn't have any expectations with the first one. I'm trying not to have any. It's hard. ♪ They keep on going ♪ ♪ Even though she said It's not like it used to be ♪ ♪ They keep on going... ♪ Music-wise, I'm very happy with what we've done. I'm much happier with the lyrics, but I know it won't be as popular. It's more personal. Maybe less unifying. Though we didn't plan for the first one to be unifying. It was just very naive. The goal is to keep doing what I do. To continue... Yeah, keep living and take my place, more than ever. That's what I did with this album. I took my place. The first album did happen this way, but luck is everywhere. I would need to be as lucky with the second album. But I should also take that place and own up to it. Now I'm here. I need to give it my all. THE NEW ERA IT'S OKAY TO REST MAKE LOVE LEARN HOW TO SAY NO LISTEN TO MYSELF! People often ask if I have dreams and actually, as much as anyone else, I believe. I think my dream now is more of a personal quest. Not so much the professional one. It never has been. I dream of being relaxed, of having the right people around. Of growing up, learning from my mistakes. Of being someone who is good to people. At the same time, who gets goodness back. If my parents had had more normal jobs, I think I would have a more normal job. Maybe I would be very happy. But actually, I'm having an amazing time. I love... I love my life. I just had to adapt to it because it happened fast. And, like, deep down, I wanted it to work out so bad. Or, not that I wanted it to work, I just didn't want to fail. I wouldn't have said, "I want to nail it" to someone out loud. I would write it down. But I couldn't say it because it... I'm sure it brought me luck not to say it. I'm superstitious. I think I didn't say it to avoid unpleasant surprises. If it didn't work out, nobody knew I wanted it to. Though it wasn't true. Well, I wish her... the best. The best for her. For everything to be okay. Now, I can feel her becoming a woman. She's starting to stand up for her beliefs, her desires. She talks about it. She used to be way quieter. I think. I thought to myself, "Would it be possible for my granddaughter to become a star?" I didn't dare say that to people. I would say, "She makes music." "Yes, but..." They would say, "I saw Angèle on TV!" "She's become someone." Did you know she's an actress now too? No. - You didn't know? - No. She never tells me anything. She's unbelievable. Since she got that dog... Okay, recording. Pepette, did you pee? You peed! Where did you pee? It's just to say that the album is finished. I think. That scares me to death. As usual. I don't know how it'll be perceived and how... How the audience will, ha! Will listen to it. But that's not... really up to me anymore. This album is me at 25. My quarter of a century. It appeared to me that I wanted to keep it real. Not try to be what I'm not. I hope I'll never forget that. I'll always be the girl from Linkebeek who writes simple songs. Even if life changes, that will stay with me. Because all this... is me. Let's stop here. Have a good journey.
