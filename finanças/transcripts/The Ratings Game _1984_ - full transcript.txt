Television, the most powerful communications tool in the history of man. Since its beginning, the networks have dictated what comes into our living rooms, but one man brought these almighty monoliths to their very knees. His name: Vic De Salvo. This is his story. - There's Lucille Ball's house. I love Lucy! Danny Thomas's is right down the block. You remember Make Room for Daddy? - Yeah, yeah, sure, boss, I remember. - Let's go borrow a cup of sugar from Bob Newhart. - We need sugar, boss? - How about a quart of milk from Lonnie Anderson? - Yeah, we need milk, too? - Bruno, oh, look at that. Pull up over there, Bruno. Hi, I'm Vic De Salvo, do you mind if I say hello? - That was pretty smooth, boss, very smooth. - This is gold, Bruno, pure De Salvo. - Funny script, huh, boss? - It's my masterpiece. Too good for the networks, I'll tell you that. Hey, boss, there's the peacock over there. - All right, pull over. It's in the bag, Bruno. What they respect in this town is confidence. No, it's okay, Bruno. Pow! - We don't accept unsolicited manuscripts, and if we did, we wouldn't accept yours. - Madame, you do accept them, and you will, and I'll tell you why. - Security. - All right, all right, all right, take it easy, take it easy, give me the scripts. Thank you very much. - Hey, Vic, hey, leave him alone! Hey, hey, hey, get your hands off him. - That's okay, Bruno. - Which one did they like the best? - The networks aren't buying Italians, Jews, and Puerto Ricans this season. They're buying gays, alcoholics, child molesters. - I can't relate to the characters. You got anything with Nazis, maybe? - Vic, I'm telling you this because I really like you: you got no future in this business. - You son of a bitches are scared. - How's it going, boss? - I think I'm on a roll, Bruno, let's go. I don't know, Bruno. How come this crap gets on the air and I can't sell a series? - What do they know out here, boss? They ain't got no culture. - Yeah. - Hello, sir. - Oh, hi, Skip, how are you? - Thank God you're home. We've been under siege. First the painters, then the decorators. I nearly had kittens. - Oh, Skip, this is great! Real class, it's just what I wanted, an exact replica of the Golden Nugget in Las Vegas. - Thank you, sir. - Now, where's my brother? - Upstairs in the den. - All right. - Ollie, explain to me how you lose a 12-ton diesel rig! Who leaves the motor running when they take a leak? Your ass, "everybody,” look, find it, just find it. Where the hell have you been while the company's going down the tubes, huh? - I was out making show business connections. - Oh, yeah? Well, try and remember, there's a trucking business that pays for this palace, and that $3 bill secretary of yours, huh? - Look, Goody, lay off Skip, he's going to get me into the right social circles out here. - The right social circle is back in Newark, which is where we ought to be right now. - All right, come on, don't start this again, huh, Goody? You know entertainment is in my blood. Remember how I used to knock 'em dead at family weddings with Volare? - Vic, you were six years old. If you finished your broccoli, they gave you a standing ovation. - Oh, come on, some people get their kicks stomping on a dream. - Look, Vic, I love you, I don't want to see you get hurt, but I gotta tell you, all those scripts you wrote, nobody's going to buy them. A series about a pimp called Munzio's Girls? A soap opera called Bayone? - All right, forget about art. I wrote another one, very commercial, it's called Sittin' Pretty, I know it, I got this TV formula down now: broads, boobs, horny guys, sex jokes, the works. This is really commercial, I mean it... - Do what you want, I don't care, but if you don't sell something very soon, we're going back home. Hey, Uncle Vic! - Hey, Rich. - You mind if Bruno runs me over to my aerobics class? - Aerobics? What the hell is happening to this family? You've got one month! - Yeah, okay, Richie, go ahead. Thanks, Uncle Vic. - Uh, well, you see, Ms. Kester, I wouldn't be calling at all except that I'm a little desperate. In my opinion, there's something wrong with your whole rating system. Now, our best summer series is The Senator and Stinky, and I just cannot imagine how it could possibly have done that badly. - Statistically, we are accurate within a 2.2% margin of error. - A zero share? - Not one of the 1,500 Computron sets were tuned into it. In short, nobody watched. - That's where you're wrong. It just so happens, Ms. Kester, that we received over 400 letters from people complaining about the show, so it's clear that somebody watched. Well, none of the Computron households. - Households, see, now that's the flaw in your system. You don't take into account college dormitories, hospitals, prisons, we get a lot of fan mail from mental institutions, that doesn't turn up in your ratings. - Look, Mr. Braithwaite, would you be complaining if you had four shows in the top 10? - No, Ms. Kester, I wouldn't, because I'd be dead from the shock. - Another happy customer. Uh, Mr. Vandergelder, did you read my report? The one about the phone surveys to augment the computer data? - Oh, yes, yes, we'll get into that, uh, Francine, but right now, I'm in conference with Miss, uh, Conroy. - Yes. I wouldn't want to interrupt a conference with the office receptionist. ♪ Looking up ♪ Stratosphere- ♪ -ically speaking ♪ Looking up ♪ If you thought we were peaking ♪ Ratings-wise ♪ We'll surprise you again ♪ And again ♪ MBC ♪ Three letters that will amaze you ♪ MBC ♪ Know that we're going to raise you ♪ MBC ♪ Where all your dreams come true ♪ This fall is all for you ♪ So hand us the winner's cup ♪ Because at MBC ♪ We're looking up ♪ Ladies and gentlemen, the star of MBC's number one comedy hit, Gimme Five, 40 pounds of fun, Woodrow T.

Mr. Vic De Salvo? Telephone call for Mr. Vic De Salvo. - Yo, over here, I'm De Salvo. - Oh, yes, how could I have forgotten? - Uh, thank you. How about a menu, I've been here for two hours. - I'll see what I can do. - Oh, yeah, thank you. Uh, yes, operator, this is Vic De Salvo. You have a call from who? Yes, I'll accept a call from Alan Alda. Hello, Al, how are you? Good, did you read the property? You loved it, great. Now, I realize that Albert Schweitzer and Mother Teresa never really met, but with you and Carol Burnett in the leads, CBS is very high on the project. - Who's that De Salvo over there? Anyone I should know? - Bye-bye. The bigger they are, the nicer they are. Uh, excuse me. -Yes? - I forgot my glasses. Is that a flaw? - I wouldn't know. - Oh, you don't get much for 14 grand these days. - Another telephone call for you, Mr. De Salvo. I'll ring it through. - Huh, can you believe this? When you're a big-time TV producer, they never leave you alone. Oh, fancy ring. Hello? Johnny, Johnny who? Oh, Johnny Carson. Now what does he want? - Hey, Vic, how you doing there? Are they buying it? - You got "em eating out of the palm of your hand. - I'll bet that Sylvester Stallone calls you next. I mean, I do a great Stallone. Adriannnn! - You're something. All right, listen, Johnny, well, all right, we'll play tennis, okay? I promise I'll call, I will call you. All right, bye-bye. I saved his career once, he never leaves me alone. So, uh, are you girls actresses, because I'm casting. Who needs you? - Your menu, Sir. - Oh. Thank you, uh, that's very delicious cake, it's very light and moist. - Mr. Friedlander, would you step into Mr. Braithewait's office for a minute? - Frank, glad you could come, sit down. Would you like some coffee? Soda? Well, let's get right down to brass tacks. Frank, you know I'm not one to mince words. I have to let you go. Sure, you're hurt, but let's not forget that The Senator and Stinky was the lowest rated show in the history of television. I don't think I have to remind you who touted that turkey. Ah, but you still have your job until five PM on Friday, Frank, so feel free to use that time to tie up any loose ends, and hey, let's not say goodbye, let's just say, so long. Oh, and Frank, leave the tape machine running on your way out, yeah, thanks. - Oh, come on, matey, things can't be that bad. Remember what we say on the Captain Andy show, "A smile is a frown turned upside down." Haha, cheer up. - Sit down, Captain Andy. Captain, you have the longest running show on MBC, which is why what I have to do now pains me. - I'm telling you, I've got an appointment with Mr. Friedlander. - I'm sorry, your name's not down here. - Well, look again! - Hold on a second. Front desk? Yes, sir, Mr. Friedlander. Mr. De Salvo's right here. - So send him up, he's a very important producer. - Yes, sir, right away. Go right ahead, Mr. De Salvo, 20th floor, sir. - Well, thank you very much, and maybe next time, you'll remember me. Friedlander, this is your lucky day. - Who are you? - The answer to your prayers. All right, now here's the capper, you're going to love this scene, it's gonna kill you. Chip is in the locker room dressed in Kim's cheerleading outfit, right, he's got two basketballs in his sweater for boobs! Now, Kim can't come out of the shower because Chip's wearing her clothes! All right, now, that ends the dream sequence. Now, we flash back 20 years... - Hold it, De Salvo. I don't have to hear another word. You don't like it? - On the contrary, I love it. It's just what this network deserves, and they're going to remember me for giving it to them. Business Affairs, please. Vic, it is Vic? - Yeah, yeah. - Vic, I think we should go to pilot on this. How would you like a firm on-the-air commitment? - You should've seen me, boys. I was brilliant, I was brilliant! - MBC must be really hard up to put that schlock on the air. - Hey, lighten up, Goody. - What's all the excitement? - Skip, I sold my show. We're going to have a big party and I'm putting you in charge. - Fabulous, I know just the caterer. - What caterer? I was planning on making some scungilli calamaris and have some cannolis afterwards. - Please, please, this is an A-party. - Uh, yeah, yeah, Skip, I want you to draw up the guest list. No lightweights. - In that case, Chuck Heston is a must. Then there's Dudley and Susan, and we mustn't forget the Robert Stacks... - Wait a minute, there's more than one? You know, Richard, when they talk about this party, and they will talk about this party, they'll all say this was Skip Imperiali's finest hour. You know, I was thinking of seating the Jack Lemmons and the Walter Matthaus at the same table. Oh, you're right, it's too on the nose, but enough glitter. What we really need are some studio honchos. We can get Brandon Tartikoff and Aaron Spelling... - Ho ho, you are a delight, Wendy, a real breath of fresh air. - That means so much to me, Wes. You know I really look up to you. - So I've heard. - Ah, working late again, Francine? - You know, I really admire your dedication. I guess for me, having a personal life is just too important. - You seem to balance them both pretty well. - Let's go, Wendy. Maybe we can finish our conference over a rack of lamb at the Le Buff and then see where we stand, huh? Goodnight, Francine. No working after midnight. Come on. - I thought this was an A party. Not one guest is showing up. - What are you complaining about? - I gave up my acting class for this. - Skip, what time you got? - 10 o'clock. - Nice party, boss. - Yeah. - Listen, Vic, where are all the celebrites you promised? - Hey, Skip, people will be coming soon, right? - Of course, sir, it's just that no one wants to be the first to arrive. - Great, meanwhile, I've got a $400 ice swan that's dripping into the chopped liver. - Hi. - Uncle Vic, Uncle Vic! Someone's coming. - See? And you were worried, come on. Come on, let's go over there. - Hey, let's go see who it is, come on. - You take it from Vic, baby. You put out free food, it attracts two things: flies and actors. Music, maestro! - I bet it's Alan Alda, he's so nice and polite, he'd call if he couldn't make it. - All right, waiters, on your toes, push the shrimp balls. - Did you see who it was? You don't know who it was? - Who's that? - That must be Mrs. Alda. Alan's probably throwing the coats on the bed. Um, hello, I'm Vic De Salvo. Welcome to our soiree, Mrs., uh... - Miss Francine Kester. - Francine Kester? Hey, everybody, Francine Kester's here. - Who's that? - So, um, where's your important and influential date? - Actually, I came alone. - Alone? I don't remember any Francine Kester on the invite list. Do you, Skip? - Please, I have no knowledge of this woman. - You don't look like you've had knowledge of any woman. Look, uh, you know, I just took my boss's invitation. I thought the party might be fun. You don't want me here, fine, I'll go home. - No, no, no, no, no, don't go, don't go, come on, come on, I like you. Hey, a drink for the lady! Come on, come on, all right, all right, all right. It's a guest. All right, what are you standing around for, mingle! Hey, all right, one drink is enough. Here you go. - Thank you. - Sheesh. - Let's eat, there's a guest come, let's get something to eat. - I'm sorry that I blew up at you before, but I'm a little edgy tonight. - Oh, I can see why. This party's a bomb. - Hey, hey, hey, I like spunk in a woman, but don't push your luck. Have a shrimp ball. All right, all right, at ease, at ease. - I can't complain about the service. - Yeah, it's the unions. You hire one guy, you gotta take his brothers with him. Don't start me on unions here. Park it over here, honey. - Some place you got here. - Yeah. - You're not an Arab. You must be a drug dealer. - No, drug dealer? No, I'm a TV producer. - I was close. So what do you do? - I'm a statistician for the Computron rating service. - Hey, I heard of that. - Yeah? - Hey, Tamara, Miss Kester here takes the ratings for the TV shows. - How glamorous. You must meet all kinds of fascinating accountants. Vic, can I talk to you alone in private, please? - Miss Kester, why don't you go hit the buffet table? If you want to take anything home, we've got foil. Go ahead, it's good. - That is one of the big celebrities you invited? - Hey, the last time I looked, you weren't exactly Meryl Streep. - And I believed you when you told me you were a producer. My God, you can't even produce a party. I thought you were here because you like me, not because you wanted to meet celebrities. - Oh, come on, Vic. I mean, you have been around the block. I mean, when was the last time you saw a girl like me with a guy like you, because she liked him? Oh, please, nice knowing you. - Uh, well, feel better. I'll call you later. Hey, Bruno. - Yeah, boss? - Tamara has decided to dissolve our relationship and go home so I want you to go into the garage, get out the Rolls Royce and wing her with it, make it look like an accident. - I can't do that, boss, it's my night off. - She dumped on you, huh? - No, no, Goody, I told her that I wasn't ready for a commitment. - Vicky, have you noticed a certain pattern in your life? I mean, since you've got money, all you do is go out with beautiful women who treat you like dirt. - It's a step up, I used to go out with ugly women who treated me like dirt. - What you need is a nice girl, a girl who like you for yourself, a girl who... - That's not my type, huh. - Who can talk to you? - Vic, try some of this pasta salad, it's delicious. - Yeah, it's very tasty. Well, help yourself, there's another 600 pounds in the kitchen. - Oh, don't feel bad. Hey, it's really a lovely party. -It is? - Yeah, at least there's no line at the buffet table. And I've never gotten this much attention in my life. I mean, usually when I go to one of these Hollywood parties, there's so many glamorous women around, nobody even notices me. Tonight, they got no choice. - I'm starting to notice you myself. - Yeah? - Yeah, where you from? - Jersey. - No. - Yeah. - You're from Jersey? - I'm from Jersey. - Hey, I'm from Jersey. - No, really? - Of course I'm from Jersey. Hey, come on, I want you to meet some people. Hey, hey, boys, we got a Jersey girl here. Jersey, yeah, what part? - Versailles. - I got a road through over there. You know the Musticandi Bakery? - Are you kidding, I went to school with the Musticandi boys. - Yeah, hey, hey, Vic, you've got a nice broad here. - Bruno, didn't you learn anything from the Women's Movement? You're not supposed to say broad in front of them. I'm sorry, boss. - Hey, Skip, more champagne, bring out the good stuff this time. Who would have figured, this disaster's turning into a party! - Hi, I'm Richie. - I'm Bruno, this is my wife, Serafina. - Hey, maestro! You guys know Volare? - Maybe I'll sing a tune. - So, after Arthur went back with his wife, I started seeing Malcolm again. - The dentist? - No, no, no, Malcolm sold white mice to laboratories. - Oh. - Yeah, he left me for an older woman, his mother. - You may find this hard to believe, but my heart's been used as a hockey puck a few times. I guess you find that hard to believe. - Not really, it's a cruel world out there. - Yeah, I've known disillusionment and despair and all those other cats. - Vic, you have such an interesting way of talking, you know? - Ah, I borrowed that from Frank, he says it on his Man and His Music album. You know, Francine, I really like you, like, I feel like I can open up to you. - That's sweet, Vic. I guess that girl tonight hurt you pretty bad, huh? - Nah, that was one of my healthy relationships. At least she didn't torch my warehouse. Some of them get vicious. - Well, we're here, this is where I live. - Oh, geez, oh, 4:30. - What? - We talked all night. - Oh, my God, it's like it just flew by. - Yeah. - So you want to come up for some coffee? - Uh, no, no, I think I better take a rain check on that because I've got a lot of appointments tomorrow. - I understand, no problem. - No, you don't understand, I had a great time. - You don't have to say that, Vic. - I know I don't have to say that. I'm saying it, that I like you, I want to see you again. - So I'll hear from you? - Yeah, yeah, we'll go to a movie or something, I'll call you. - Great. - So, goodnight. - Goodnight. - What happened, boss, you didn't score? - Oh, of course I didn't score. This is an intelligent and sensitive woman, she doesn't have casual sex with every guy she meets. - That's too bad, we'll find you one that's your type. - Yeah, Francine's different. You know, Bruno, I never knew I could have so much fun with a girl standing up. - Well, you know, sometimes, boss, you can't build a relationship on just relating... - Yeah, you got a point there. - All right. - God, the De Salvo script sucks. I can't believe Friedlander did that to me. We've always had such a close personal relationship. - It's called revenge. - Yeah, well, why couldn't he just steal office supplies like everybody else? - Well, we're stuck with it. If we don't air that show, he could sue us for millions. - But that's crap, we can't put that on the air. - Never stopped us before. - True. - What do you know, don't tell me, I'm an Emmy-winning director, I ain't gonna take any of this crap from anybody. - Ah, who needs you, I'll direct this pilot myself. All right, take it from the top, with feeling, come on. - Hi, girls. - Who are you? - I'm your, uh, roommate. - No, no, no, no, Steve, look, you're playing this too white bread. I mean, you gotta think of what you're playing here. You just fell into pussy. I mean, you walk into a room, you don’t come in like a wimp, you strut, you use a little body English. You see a set of twin hooters like that, you go, Marone! - Vic, I'm playing a guy named Chip Wainwright, he's a student at Princeton. - Well, where do you think Princeton is? It's in New Jersey, don't tell me how people talk from Jersey. Ooh. What's he getting so upset about? All right, listen, girls, Steve is leaving the company due to artistic differences. In other words, he stunk on ice. Uh, I have decided to step into the role of Chip Wainwright. Great. - So tomorrow, be here at 10 o'clock sharp. Okay. - Hey, Vic? - Yeah? - I think you did the best thing. Steve's performance was hurting the integrity of the piece. - You really think so? - Yeah. - Well, that's really nice of you to say, Stacy, I'm glad somebody understands me. Look, how about if you and I, uh, we go out tonight and unwind? - I'd love to, Vic. There's just one small thing I have to do first. - Yeah? - Well, I have to break up with Steve, but that should take about a half hour. Why don't you pick me up at 9:007? - Yeah, alright. - Okay, bye. Hello, stranger, this is your mother in New Jersey. It's costing me $2 to speak to a machine. So, are you seeing anybody? You don't have that many child-bearing years left, you know, I'd like to see some grandchildren before I die, which could be any day, the way I'm feeling. Anyway, have a nice evening. - What a great idea, Vic. The Santa Monica pier. - Yeah, I come here all the time, reminds me of back home. You ever hear of Palisades Park in New Jersey? - No, I'm from West Covena. - Yeah. - Aren't you a little chilly? - Oh, I love the cold weather. They used to sing the song, Palisades has the rides, Palisades has the fun, come on over, you know? - Real catchy tune. Hey, why don't we go to the Hard Rock Cafe? - What for, they don't have skee ball. I'll spot you 100 points. Hey, you want a chocolate banana? Come on, I'll buy you a chocolate banana. Uh, let me have two, two chocolate bananas. - Vic, I just remembered. You want us off the book tomorrow, right? - Yeah. - Well, I'm still a little shaky on that second act. You'd better take me home. - Yeah, I guess I better. Francine? Francine! Hit the horn again, Bruno. Francine? - Vic, what do you want? - I've got to ask you something, it's very important. What? - Do you know the words to the Palisades Park theme song? - Wait a minute, you don't call me for two weeks and you wake me up in the middle of the night and ask me if I know the words to the Palisades Park theme song? - No, come on, do you know them? - What the Sam Hill's going on out there, keep it down! - Palisades has the rides, Palisades has the fun, come on over, there's fun and dancing for free so is the parking, so gee, come on over. - That's it!

Worst pilot ever. This tops that sitcom we did Efrem Zimbalist. - Well, gentlemen, tonight we wrote a new chapter in the annals of show business history. - You could say that. - The only concern I have is being tied down to a hit show for eight or nine years. So when do we go on the air? - Well, we were just talking about that. It's going to be a Tuesday evening in October. The 9:00 timeslot. 9:00? That's good, we get the oldsters, we get the youngsters, I like that time slot, what's our competition? - Oh, nothing much, just the World Series. - The World Series? Yeah, the World Series. - But nobody will watch the show! - No, you really think so? It can't be true! Come on, you gotta give our show a chance! - We are. All you have to do is beat the World Series in the ratings. - Deep breaths, Vic, take little breaths. - Geez. Do you believe that? - Drink your wine, Vic, you'll feel better. - I don't know, Francine, I don't know what's wrong with me. Why can't I command any respect in this town? - Oh, that's not true, Vic, a lot of people think very highly of you. - Maybe Goody's right, maybe I don't belong in show business. - Come on, now, that doesn't sound like you. The man who took one You-Hauler and turned it into the second largest trucking business in the country? - But that was different, Francine, I was dealing with thugs, hitmen, and goons. These network guys are scary. - Vic, cheer up. I'll watch your show. - Ah, great. Then all I need is a hundred million more people to beat the World Series. - It's not true. You can have a big hit in TV with only 100 people watching, if they're the right people. - Is that right? Tell me more. So you're telling me that 1,500 families control the whole ratings deal? Yeah, well, you know it's very scientific, like, one ratings family represents 100,000 homes. - So, in other words, if you was to persuade these people to watch your show, you'd be in. - I like that word, persuade, boss. Remember the teamster election of '74? - Yeah. - Forget about it, Vic. I mean, these people have to report anyone who tries to influence them. - Yeah, but suppose they didn't know they were being influenced. - But the names of these people are top secret. Even the CIA couldn't get a hold of them. - Yeah, well, the CIA isn't going steady with the girl wonder of the ratings business. - Stop the car! - Whoa, what's going on over there? - Francine, come on, get back in the car! - I thought you cared about me. - I do, I do. What, do I have to hurl myself off a hill to prove it? - You just want to use me to advance your career. - I think I just tripped over a dead elk. I'm from Newark, what am I doing on a mountain? - Leave me alone, I'm going home. - She's going home. You're going to need a parachute from here. Francine, I'm liable to step on a snake here. - Don't worry, they never bite their own kind. - Francine, forget what I said. I was only kidding, where are you going? Oh, oh, oh, my God. - You've been lying to me from the start, setting me up for this. - Hey, I didn't make a move on you for four dates. If that's not love, I don't know what is. Ay, Marone, where we going? Francine. - True love is not using, love is caring and helping and sharing. - Well, love is not climbing and falling, either. We gotta get out of here, they'll never find us, I got no flares on me. Come on, Francine. Look, I apologize, come back to the car. - Don't touch me. I thought you were different. You're like all the rest. - Look, I know you been hurt, but not every guy is trying to use you. At least, not this guy. - How do I know? - Come on, come here. Sit here, sit down. Sit down. Look, would you forgive me? Because I was temporarily blinded by those lights down there. See, all I ever wanted was to be part of that, but I would never hurt you to get it. - I know. I'm sorry I over-reacted. - Let's never fight again, all right? - So this is what they write about in all those women's magazines, huh? - What's that? - The big O. - Oh, all right, let's do this right here. Well, I'm going to get all dirty here. - That's the idea. - May I have your attention please? I have an announcement to make. I want you all to say hello to Wendy Conroy, our new head of marketing research. - You have been promising me that job for 11 years, and then you give it to a broad who has seen more ceilings that Michelangelo. - When? When did I promise? - Every Christmas, instead of a bonus, but I guess Wendy got it because she had a great overnight rating. - Look, in lieu of a promotion, how about your own parking spot, directly adjacent to the handicap space? - How about doing to yourself what you normally do to Wendy? - This is a gold mine, Sweeney, Foley, Johnson, Sawyer, Miller, Brown, Nelson, Calbot, Applebee, Olsen, Bailey, Rutherford, I didn't know people really had names like that. - I selected only families in key precincts. You get them all to watch, you got the highest rated show of the year. - Baby, you're a genius. - But nobody's going to get hurt, right? - Oh, no, no, au contraire, these people are going to have the time of their lives. - What do you mean by that? - You'll see. Goody, tomorrow I want you to call the boys all over the country. We're going to have a little meeting. - Ah, gentlemen, come in, come in. Welcome, welcome. Right this way, please. The bar is on your right, and I trust you know these other gentlemen here. - Hey, Bruno, what's going on? Somebody die or what? - I don't know, he won't even tell me. I guess it's going to be something important for him to bring all the boys in. - Oh, no, no, Richie, put it over there. - Hey Goody, am I nuts or have I been here before? - The lobby of the Golden Nugget. - Classy! - Thank you very much. - All right, all our boys. All right, now. I am offering you a piece of one of the biggest money-making rackets in America today. - Drugs? - Hookers? - Car insurance? - No, no, no, no, television, where a minute of advertising costs $100,000, and one rating point is worth $40 million to a network. - You've got our undivided attention. - And, do you know who controls this whole racket? 1,500 families. - So boys, D-Day is the 14th of October. On that day, we've arranged for a number of these families to be out of their houses. - So what do you need us for? - While they're away, we are providing a little house-sitting service. This is where your boys come in. They're gonna go in and take care of things, water the plants, maybe watch a little TV. - Let me get this straight, Vic, you want me and my truckers to break and enter into the homes of innocent people and help you perpetuate this fraud? - Yeah. - I got no problem with that. - How the hell you gonna get 1,500 families out of their houses? - We only need to get rid of 100 families in the key precincts. - We're sending them on a little cruise, curtains. - You got it, unc. - This is like in school, right? You remember Sister Allawicius, whack on your hand. All right, it's going up. Here you see our luxury cruise ship. - It looks like a garbage scow. What did you do, raise the Andrea Doria? - After we fix it up, they'll swear it's the Queen Mary. - Richie, next slide. This is the continental United States. Let us start with the Midwest. Tony, that is your territory. - Honey, kids! A cruise! - Oh, Harold, a cruise! Kids, hurry! - Honey, honey! - Dear, look here. - Come along, fellas, quickly, quickly, now, quickly, quickly. Tyrone, Tyrone, Tyrone, Tyrone, I mean, I was going for '30s deco here. Remember Fred and Ginger in Shall We Dance? I mean, Tyrone, do you call that egg shell white? It's throwing off my whole color scheme. Please, Tyrone. - Oh, Francine, after last night, when Webster defines the word ecstasy, he's gonna have to put our picture in the dictionary. Ooh, such language, I love it when you talk like that. Oh, Francine... - Vic, I gotta talk to you. - Uh, look, honey, I'll call you back, Goody's here. All right, I love you. Bye-bye. What, what is it? - Look at these bills, this scam of yours is killing us! - Just think of it as an investment in the future. - Okay, genius, a week from today, a hundred families are showing up for a cruise on the Love Boat, they're expecting to see TV stars. -So? A little help, Uncle Vic? - Yeah, yeah, yeah, Richie. So where are we gonna get TV stars? - Look, Goody, Goody, just relax, will you? - They're expecting to see celebrities. - Don't worry about it, I got just the guy. He's gonna be available soon. - Thanks, Uncle Vic! - Well, boys and girls, it's Captain Andy's final show. Yep, the network has relieved the Captain of his command. Yes, they're giving him the shift. Yep, after 23 years in this studio. And there is a lesson in that, boys and girls, and you know what that lesson is? Yeah, do it to them before they do it to you! Now, how about singing our theme song? Are you ready? ♪ I just set sail for the land of fun ♪ Won't you be my shipmate ♪ Joy galore for everyone ♪ Won't you be my shipmate, sing ♪ Set sail for the land of fun ♪ Won't you be my shipmate ♪ Joy galore for everyone ♪ Bye-bye, kids, nice knowing you. - Oh, you know, Captain Andy, I watched your show ever since I was a little boy, I always admired it, I can't believe that they took you off the air. - That's show-biz, son. Two daytime Emmys and you're history. - Yeah, yeah, well look, I've got a little proposition for you, you might like it, it pays good money. All you gotta do is sign a few autographs and shake a few hands. - As long as the check clears, he'll do anything! Salty, shut up. You shut up. I should have done most of the talking equitable but all right. Ah, shut up, I'm talking. - Yeah, yeah. - Mom, I don't want to go on the cruise, I'm going to miss the World Series tonight. - I'm sure there will be a TV on board. - But Mom... - Are you aware of that helicopter, mister? - Don't we get a ticket? - No, no, it'll be okay. - Mr. and Mrs. Foley, welcome aboard. You'll be on B deck, cabin four. Have a nice cruise. Oh, the Sweeneys, C-deck, cabin 22. - Oh, this doesn't look like the real Love Boat to me. Where's the real Love Boat crew, Doc, Isaac, Gopher? Where are they? - We fed 'em to the sharks and that's what we're going to do to you! - Mom! - Don't worry, he's only kidding. That little shit. Well, there's an air of electricity tonight at the South Bronx as the home champions take on the big blue wreckin' crew. Yes, I can't imagine a home in America that isn't tuned into this drama tonight. Play ball! - There's no TV set on the ship. What are we going to do tonight? I can't even watch the World Series. - I think we can do without television. After all, it's only one weekend, Todd. - We all can. It would be good for us. - Well, what are we gonna do if we can't watch TV? - Well, we could talk to each other, get to know one another. - Yeah, Mr. Johnson's right. We don't need television, let's just, uh, have a conversation. - Did anyone see Dynasty last week? - Yes, yes. - Oh, did you believe what Lexus did to Crystal? Isn't she a slut? Now we're all tied up with two apiece. Dave Winfield trying to get the Yankees out in front. Three balls, two strikes, the windup, the delivery, and Winfield fouls it up into the upper deck. - Come on, Winfield, earn your money. - Hey, it's 9:00, we gotta turn on Vic's show. - Turn off the game now? What, are you nuts? - That's what Vic's paying us for. The pitch, it's hit deep, deep, oh... ♪ Well he's got what he wants ♪ Well he's lovin' the life he's got ♪ Well he's having a ball, yeah, he's gettin' it all ♪ Yeah, he's gettin' a lot ♪ - Marone! - Ha, look at this, huh?

By the way, roomies, where do I sleep? I guess we learned an important lesson today: honesty is the best policy. - All right, I'm glad that's over. Now let's get back to the game. - That was a very moving moment. ♪ Sittin' pretty, all right ♪ Sittin' pretty ♪ Well, if you just tuned in, you missed the play of the century, I want to tell you, yes indeedy-doody. - Good morning, Trish. - Parker, the colonel's in there. - The colonel, chairman of the board? Yes. - Well, that's it. It was fun while it lasted. Colonel, what brings you here to... - I'm waiting for Parker Braithewait. - Uh, colonel, I'm Parker Braithewait. Remember, we met last year when you hired me? - God, you've aged, son. You know Buster. - Sure, sure, of course I do. Hello, Buster. - Well, if you have seen the overnight ratings, you know why I'm here. - Uh, colonel, it's easy to single me out on this one, but there are plenty of others who should share the responsibility. - Listen to that. He pulls off the programming coup of the year, hell, the decade, and he modestly shares credit with others. There's a lesson in that, Buster. - Programming coup? De Salvo got a 60 share? - Half of America tuned out the World Series to watch that little wop. - Well, I knew it would be good, I just, I never dreamed these numbers. - Yeah, think about what it'll be next week when there's no competition! - But colonel, that was just a pilot, we wanted to see how it would go before we went rushing into series. - It's officially a series, Braithwaite. Episode number two airs in six days. Do I make myself clear? Clear? - Oh, Mr. De Salvo. Always good to see you, sir. Mr. Braithwaite's waiting for you at table one. This way, please. - Well, hey, buddy, good to see you, I was getting a little worried, you're an hour late. -Am I? William, a bottle of Chateau Margaux '61, please. - Excellent, sir. - Now look, Vic, I'm willing to eat a little humble pie here and give you an order for six shows. - I'm Sicilian and we never discuss business until after we've eaten. William, what's your bill of fare today? - We have several specials today, gentlemen. - Specials? - Scampi palermo, tiny baby prawns gently sauteed in a fine... I don't mean to rush you, Vic, but it is your third cup of espresso. State your case. - Fine. I'll give you 13 weeks, firm. - Not so fast. I want production offices. I want six on-the-air commitments. I want a back-ended syndication deal, up front. - All right, anything you want. What do you say? - I don't know, I'll sleep on it. - Vic, Vic, Vic, Vic, I'm on my knees! Don't refuse a man on his knees! - Will that be cash or charge, sir? - Did your order one sex maniac? - Vic, what are you doing here? I told you we shouldn't be seen together for a while. - What, what, what are you so nervous about here? Here, here, here, check out these goodies that I picked up at the House of Kinky on Sepulveda. A glow-in-the-dark brassiere. Not tonight, Vic, I'm too tense. - Well, then, you're in good hands, because I'm a licensed pervert. - I don't believe you came here. You could have been tailed by the feds. - Tailed by the feds? What am I, Dillinger? - Oh, I am just glad that those families are docking and coming home tonight, maybe I'm going to finally get a good night's sleep. -Um. I think there's something that you should know. - What? - Sittin' Pretty got picked up for 22 weeks. -So? - So, if I let those people come home and they don't watch my show, it'll get canceled. - Are you saying what I think you're saying? - What choice did I have? - Hello, passengers, this is your old Captain Andy speaking. Good news, gang, your dream cruise aboard the Love Boat has been extended for 22 fabulous, fun-filled weeks. Next stop, Cancun, Mexico! Olé! - For crying out... - What's he talking about? - 22 weeks, why aren't we docking? - Hey, I have to be at work tomorrow! - Turn this ship around! - Mellow out, people. - |I don't care what anybody says, I'm going on that life boat. - Yeah, yeah, that's right. - What are we doing here, cane mutiny? - Hold it, ain't nobody going anywhere. Get back to the shuffleboards. It's your shot, Pops. - Paisan Mageshin's. Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Alda. Mr. De Salvo's in a conference. Shall I have him get back to you? Fine. - Vic, you want Monday night, it's yours, babe. Run with it. - Okay, I'm going to save your asses. I've got a story based on a character that I grew up with. His name was Nunzio Romanelli. - That's good, I'm laughing already. - It's not a comedy. It's an action-adventure. - Action-adventure? Good counter programming, write that down, action-adventure. - Anyway, Nunzio hung out in Coney Provo's bar on Route 4. If you wanted to get your rocks off, you went to see Nunzio. - You want to do a show about a pimp? - Yeah. - Breakthrough concept. - Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, good, good, write it down, write it down. - Yeah.

Denise? - CBS dropped a bombshell today by announcing it could no longer subscribe to the Computron rating service. At a hastily called news conference, network spokesman Alvin Small had this to say. - We challenge the accuracy of their polling methods. How is it possible that Nunzio's Girls beat the M♪A♪S♪H reunion special? - This is a sorry day for Computron. Never once in 30 years has our credibility been challenged, until now. I want an internal investigation, I want a complete systems check, and I want it today. - Oh, no, we're in some hot water now. - Yeah, we better get outta this town fast. - You dumb bastard, I oughta... - I didn't know the race was fixed, boss. - Uh oh, Goombas are in trouble with their bookie. - It's not bad enough we gotta watch TV at night, now we gotta watch it all damn day, too. - It's about time they put something on Saturday a person can relate to. You fishbait son-of-a... - Who the hell is that? - I don't know. - Well, go get rid of them. Hey, I ain't fighting no friggin' lone star. - What do you want? - Mr. Sweeney? - Yeah. - Mr. Carl Sweeney? - Yeah, what's it to you? - Oh, I'm from the TV rating service and I wanted to ask you some questions about your viewing habits. - Yeah, well, I can't talk now, I've got some topovers in the oven. - Hey, hey, who cut the flounder in here? - Goody, I mean, who would'a figured this, huh? This is incredible. Me, Vic De Salvo, up for most popular actor. I just hope my public supports me. - What public, you got 200 goons watching your show. Remember, it's the real viewers that choose the winner, So you ain't got a chance. - Vic, I gotta talk to you. - Ah, Francine. - Listen to me, Vic, you haven't got much time left. They're onto you, they're conducting an investigation. - Oh, shit, I knew it. Vic, we gotta get the ship back. - How? We lost contact with them when they passed the equator. - Well, we're getting lost too, I'm making reservations. - Whoa, whoa, wait a minute, I'm not going anywhere until after that award show tomorrow night. - Vic, are you crazy? It could be a matter of hours before this whole thing blows up in your face. Goody is right, you gotta leave town. - No, hold it. Look, you people don't understand. I came to Hollywood to make it big. - You did that. - But it's not official, not until tomorrow night, at that ceremony, when they read, "And the nominees are: "Vic De Salvo." Francine, I want you there, by my side. That would make it perfect. - I've been miserable without you, Vic. - Me too. Does that mean you'll come with me? - Sure, what the hell? - Uncle Vic, it's ready. - Oh, thanks, Richie. - Goody, would you fix me a double scotch? - Yeah, I'll make it two. - Your attention, please. Mambo lessons on B-deck have been postponed. Good news is that we have picked up a day and a half due to the storm currents and we should be in the Aleutian Islands in time for Christmas. Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way! - Oh, Mr. Vandergelder, we don't exactly know what De Salvo has done with the families, but this scam is definitely happening all over the country. And now, back to live coverage of the 11th annual TV Digest Awards. - And here comes the recipient of tonight's lifetime achievement award, ladies and gentlemen, one of America's greatest comedians, Mr. Benny Benson! Still chasing the girls! - You're on me, but I forgot what to do when I catch 'em! - That's our Benny. - I'm taking a pretty big chance, coming here tonight. - It was worth it to see you in that dress. - Like it? - Yeah, I like it. - It's a bridal gown, my mother bought it for me as a birthday hint. - Hey, Bruno, don't get lost, because right after the show, I'm leaving for the airport. - All right, boss. Hey, uh, hey, boss, break a leg, huh? - Okay. - Officer, officer. - Oh, program. Vic, look, look! - It finally hit the fan. - Come on, we gotta get out of here. - Uh, look, you go to your seat. Don't worry about me. If I could just duck them until I hear my name called. - Be careful. - Yeah. - Okay, go now, Benny. - Oh. - I don't want to have to take you during the show six times, come on. That's it, come on. Don't dawdle in there. - Well, he couldn't have gotten out of this building, all the exits are blocked. - Well, we'll keep looking, sir, he won't get away. - If this is true, Braithwaite, I'm going to feed your nuts to Buster. - Parker, Denise Leclair, Showbiz Tonight. - Oh, hi, Denise, hi. Should be a terrific show this evening. - Parker, they're already calling it Ratingsgate, the first rigging of the ratings by a major network. Any comment? Live from Los Angeles, the 11th Annual TV Digest Awards. Brought to you by ChemCorp: we're fighting to earn back your trust. And Bow Wow Chow: we only call it dog food because we have to. - Come on, zip it up, Benny, the show's starting. It's about time. Come on. That a boy. Let's not catch a chill, you're doing Merv tomorrow. Okay, let's go. And now, your host, Mr. Steve Allen! - Thank you very much, and welcome to long day's journey into night. I guess I was the, uh, logical choice to host this show, I'm the only one in the business who's not up for an award tonight. But all seriousness aside, it's a real pleasure for me to look out here at this particular audience and see all the new faces on top of the old faces. But I do want to welcome everybody to the TV Digest Awards. And you know what makes this show different from the other 712 award shows is that you, the viewer, pick the winners, that's right, using the ballots in your TV Digest Magazine. And now, from the accounting firm of Skank and Skank, here's Mr. Zack Silverman to explain the rules. - All right, you little son of a bitch, I know you're in there, come on out. Holy shit. - This is a hell of a life achievement award. - Well, here, now comes the moment that I personally have been looking forward to, the annual presentation of TV Digest's life achievement award, given to those who have distinguished themselves in a long career of television excellence, and who better to receive this award than Benny Benson? That's right, if you grew up in the '50s, you knew Benny as Uncle Moe on The Ginsburgs. If you grew up in the '60s, you knew him as Uncle Ned on Give it to Gopher. And if you grew up in the '70s, you knew him as Gramps on Them Darn McGintys. Well, sir, he's 87 years old now, and he still watches his reruns from the actors' home in Woodlands Hills, ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Benny Benson, how about it? Doesn't he look great? Oh, thank you, my dear. Benny, here's your well-deserved award, God love you. It's a TV award. How about this, Benny? - He stole my big moment, I'm Benny Benson! Go shoot him. - What the... - Benny, Benny! - Ladies and gentlemen, how about this? It's unplanned and unbelievable. Benny Benson is doing one of his great fall man sketches, A Night at the Station! Isn't that fantastic, folks? A classic bit of slapstick from the golden age of comedy. - Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me. 87 years old, the man can still take a pratfall. - Okay, all right, we got him. - You have the right to remain silent. You give up that right to remain silent, anything you say can and will be held against you in a court of law. - Vic, how could you do this to me? - And now to join me in presenting the award for most popular actor, she's lovely, she's talented, and she also wrote this introduction, Miss Jane Meadows, here she is. - Oh, thank you, sweetheart, for that lovely introduction. The nominees for America's most popular actor, as voted by the readers of TV Digest, are: Alan Alda... - You have violated the sanctity of the ratings system. - Quiet, they're about to read my name. Tom Selleck. - You'll hear your name at the arraignment, let's go. Hey, you! John Forsythe. - Fan out, let's fan out! Robert Wagner. And Vic De Salvo. - May we have the envelope please, thank you. - And the winner is, oh, so exciting. - John Forsythe. - Vic De Salvo. - I won, I won? I won, I won! I won, I won, I can't believe it. People must have been watching my show! - Uncle Vic, way to go, Uncle Vic! - Holy shit. - Hey, Francine. Thank you very much. Thank you, I, uh, I didn't think was gonna win, so, I didn't prepare a speech. But I'll wing something. Uh, tomorrow, you's'a gonna be reading some very adverse publicity about me. These ain't exactly ID bracelets here. These are cuffs. I'd be lying if I said I was sorry for what I did. I've always wanted to be part of this community, and I feel vindicated by this award, because... - Salute, Vic. - It tells me that there were people watching my show, and they like the show, it's not just a handful of people that were picked by a computer. So, I just want to say that, uh, this is the happiest night of my life. Thank you, thank you. Oh, and one more thing. There is a woman in the audience who I'm probably not going to get to see much of for a little while. But I just want to tell her, in front of millions of people all over the country, that I love her very much. Thank you. - Congratulations, we're just going to walk over here. - I think there's some people waiting for me over here. And so Vic De Salvo was convicted of tampering with television's sacred rating system. And from his new base of operations, De Salvo turned MBC into the number one network, the programming genius of the age. Mazel Tov! And his wedding to Francine Kester became the social event of the season.
