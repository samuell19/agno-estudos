Uh, start a new heritage collection of biodynamic wines. - Mom! - Do you think we can do that? I'm glad you came home. Yeah. Mom, we're late. I'm so sorry. I-I totally lost track of time. - 'I'm going. Let's go!' - To be continued? Yes, ma'am, of course. 'Summer's almost over, folks.' 'And you know what that means. It's back to school.'

It's gonna be great. 'There you go. There's that smile.' 'Thank you, Tracy, for all your help.' So it looks like you're ahead of the curve. What does that mean? It means you're gonna be taking AP Bio with the seniors. But something tells me you can handle it. 'Well, she can academically' but this is all so new. Are you sure... It's okay, mom. I can do it. Great. It's settled then. So I asked one of our best students and the president of the Pep Squad to show Beatrice around. Chloe, why don't you introduce yourself? Hi, I'm Chloe, obviously. - Hi. - Hi, Chloe. - So you're ready? - Yeah. Yeah. - 'Have fun.' - Bye, mom. She's in good hands. We don't really care as much about that stuff here. It's more sports and rah-rah. I mean, it's fun obviously, but.. - What? - I don't know. It just gets, like, socially competitive. Cheerleaders and the jocks, like, being popular.

It was just.. - Jack. - Yeah. - And Bee, of course, you know. It's okay. Well, it sounds like you're shaking up the wine industry like you did tech. No surprises there. Yeah, it's, it's actually going really well. - You should stop by sometime. - I'd like that. 'Luke, look, he's got the vineyard next to mine.' I've seen him out in the fields. I have a feeling some of the wine makers aren't too happy I'm back. I wouldn't take it personally. They just don't want anymore competition especially from a woman. They'll come around. Just give them some time. You don't wanna come on too strong though because then they'll know how ambitious you are and then they might make it a little harder for you. This is me.

Yeah, sure. I-I'll do what I can. Thanks, Mac. Appreciate it, man. - Thanks, coach. - Yeah. Pictures are inconclusive. And your daughter can't identify who was in the room with her. 'She knows he was wearing a hoodie' just like the guy watching from the window. - We both saw him. - That's not hard evidence. And I bet every single guy on that team owns a hoodie. Plus, from the sound of things, it was attempted assault. She ran out before anything really happened. You have pictures of my daughter passed out with five different soccer players. You could start there. You gotta be real careful about these kind of accusations, Emma. The whole town loves those players. They're good boys. 'I mean, sure, it was stupid, but it's not what you think.' It was still wrong. You really want to ruin these boys' lives 'over a misunderstanding?' This isn't a misunderstanding. This is my daughter! You know Bryan's dad is serving time? He's a good kid. He doesn't need this right now. - It doesn't matter what... - Let's just go, mom. Please? - This is ridiculous. - Have a good day, ladies. Come on, sweetie. We need a sugar splurge. I remember when peanut-butter fudge used to make everything better. Yeah, well, I'm not five years old anymore, mom. I'm so sorry you had to go through all this. Why is this happening to me? Look, until we get to the bottom of this I don't think you should talk to any of the players. It's just not safe. Okay. Hi, um, Ms. Kirk, Bee. Look, I just wanted to apologize to you both. Um, on behalf of the team. I think we're gonna need some time. Yeah, I get that. Hey, listen, if there's anything I can do, Beatrice to make life easier for you at school, just... I think you've done enough already. And then he has the nerve to say "Oh, these things happen when girls drink." Can you believe that? And all that was in front of Beatrice? - Yes. - Unbelievable. I mean.. How's she taking it? Oh, I thought going to the police would make her feel better. I mean, that they would at least try to help. Ugh! Listen, if it's any comfort to you at all I'm trying to get that site taken down. And Mac said he's gonna try and help me. Oh, thank you. I feel awful. I mean, those are my guys. Well, you know, what they say. Boys will be boys. Not mine. I do not tolerate that kind of behavior. Well, I think Beatrice just wants to forget about the whole thing. It's like every time she speaks up, it gets worse. Yeah, look, I know it's hard to watch someone you love in so much pain, but I just have to believe this is only gonna make her stronger. Hm. I want a long table so everyone feels part of it. Okay, yeah we're gonna use the, uh, sawhorses and the leftover cedar from the new tasting room. Ah, great! So it-it-it looks like it will be about 20 if-if we're lucky. Alright. - Ah.. - Hey, what's wrong? Maybe we should just cancel. No. No, no, no, no. It's gonna be beautiful even if it is just you and me, Luke and Beatrice. Beautiful. It's the school. Hello? What do you mean poison? Well, I-I'm on my way. Death threats? - Poison? - It was not poison, Emma. It was a scare tactic. It-it was just baby powder. I want that graffiti taken off now! Of course, I understand. We'll take it down when the police are through... - Were there any witnesses? - The janitor arrived at 6 a.m. Saw nothing out of the ordinary. This, this has to stop. Emma, I understand your concern but you have to trust us. We're doing everything we can. And we're taking this very, very seriously, Emma. Oh, of course you are, now that your jobs are on the line. Now, that's unfair. Two women report incidents of bullying and assault and you tell me these things just happen? 'That's not the way it is, Emma, and you know it.' - 'You have to calm down.' - Emma, please. - Let us handle it. - That's what I've been doing. And it's only gone from bad... to worse! 'Emma!' Emma! What up, man? Hey, man. - Hey. - When are you gonna talk to me? Come on, dude. I said I was sorry. Bryan, dude, that's messed up. Hey, hey, don't.. Don't worry about it. Your secret's safe with me, okay? 'I see it a lot.' Bullying is incredibly easy online, the anonymity of it. Too easy if you ask me. I still don't think we should've done this. Come on. Ah! - It's not working. - 'Is caps locks on?' 'No, I'll try again.' With Rachel, she kept it in. The only reason we know about the bullying was her journal. It's not working. - What? - Here. Let me try. 'Good luck.' And you know what's so heartbreaking? - What? - I think the kids knew. Word spreads like wildfire around that school. Yeah, it does. Wait, someone must have changed it. That's impossible! Look, I'm at the site. Nothing. Oh, my God! We've been hacked? April had to have known something. She was Rachel's best friend, and Bryan. Right, Bryan was dating April. ♪ The storm is rising now ♪ And all I really want is just to be ♪ No, back then he was with Rachel. ♪ Pretending to be nice so dangerous inside ♪ ♪ And I won't stop you this is the end ♪♪ May I come in, please? 'Sure.' ♪ All the things we knew How's it going? Just taking it one day at a time. You're wise beyond your years. - It's Tracy's advice. - Oh. Thank God for Tracy. ♪ Every bond we make Bryan said something. It was weird. - Weird how? - He said that he knew better. I mean, what does that even mean? 'Mom?' There was a similar incident here two years ago. Another girl blacked out at a party. A guy started stalking her and threatened to kill her if she said anything. Oh, so it's not just me? No, sweetie. And it's serious. The girl.. What? Mom, I need to know. She's gone, sweetie. Uh, like.. ...moved gone or.. Gone gone. 'Come on in.' Hey. You okay? Yeah. I mean.. No one will talk to me and my life sucks but other than that.. - Quick question for you. - Yeah? What's that? I know why Bryan feels guilty. Tracy told my mom. What do you know about his old girlfriend? The one who.. Well... I know he loved her. And he didn't see it coming. I mean, none of us did. It was devastating. - I just keep feeling like.. - Like what? Like everyone knows something that I don't like-like they're all keeping some big secret from me. We all felt responsible. Maybe that's why we didn't wanna tell you. To keep you safe and to protect you. But it didn't. - And now everything's... - Hey, hey. Hey, look at me. Look at me. You are so strong. You're gonna get through this. - Okay? Trust me. - Okay. Yeah. 'That settles it. I'm pulling you out of school.' And we're cancelling the reopening. No. Mom, please, don't. You know that's not gonna make them stop. Sweetie, this kid is at your school. Uh, he's made it clear he wants to hurt you. I just can't believe he came at you like that right in the middle of the school day. It's not the first time I've seen him there. What? Uh, uh, why didn't you say anything? W-well, because at first I-I didn't realize. 'I thought it was just in my head.' The police need to hear about this. Like they'll believe her. They've taken statements from the entire staff and when I was leaving, they were questioning kids. - Starting with the team. - And the cheerleaders? I'm sure. I'll go myself tomorrow. It's all gonna be okay. 'Jenny said she was wasted when they found her.' Which is why I need to know who gave her that drink. - It's important. - I'm sorry. I don't know. Uh, look, April. I have gone through this in my head so many times now. And every time it leads me back to you. You were the last person she saw that night. I wish I could go back to that night and.. I did make that slam site. I was so angry she took Bryan away from me. April, that did not give you the right... I know, I took it too far. Way too far. It was cruel. And when I heard about what happened I tried to take it down, but.. Look, I can talk to you about this later. Just not here. Bryan. Come on, man. Talk to me. Dude, what's your deal? I said I wouldn't say anything. - Shut up, okay? Just shut up! - 'What the heck, man?' Why are you acting like such an ass? Dude, what's going on with you? I don't know how that spray paint ended up in my bag. So can you please just stop pretending like you're doing me a favor and get off my back? - Okay. I get it. - No. - You really don't get it. - Are you serious? Dude, I was there for you during Rachel and then your dad 'and now you're gonna let this girl' get in the way of our friendship? Don't do that, man. She's crazy. Screw you. Oh, my God! Rachel. ♪ Swimming through ♪ Hidden secrets now reveal ♪ Now there's nothing to take back ♪ ♪ This train is heading off the track ♪ ♪ All my colors turn to black ♪ All my colors turn to black ♪ Mm-hmm mm-hmm ♪ Hey, did you see my phone? Nah. No, man. Haven't seen it anywhere. Alright. I'll see you tomorrow. Oh. Ah. Beatrice? Bee? Are you up here? Bee? I am telling you, my daughter is not suicidal. But we can't rule it out. We had a similar case just a couple of years back. You saw what happened at school. Someone is stalking her. Uh, this doesn't even sound like Bee. But it does sound like someone who's been bullied who's felt isolated. Sometimes the parents are the last ones to know. But she did know, she's been telling you.. - Over and over again. - Would you let me do my job? If you were doing your job, there wouldn't be a missing girl right now. This isn't getting us anywhere. If you think of anything else, call me. Unbelievable. 'It's April. Leave a message.' April, it's me again. Call me back. I-I'm starting to get worried. Hey. Hey, hey. It's me. It's me. Oh, my God. You scared me. Tracy just called. April was attacked in the parking lot. - Oh, my God. Is she okay? - No, Emma, she's not. - What do you mean? - Brain hemorrhage. She never even made it to the hospital. Coach, coach, Emma there's something I got to tell you guys. - It's about Bee. - What? She texted me before she went missing. "Hello, what's with radio silence?" I couldn't find my phone. You can ask any of the guys. It was right after practice. I think someone took my phone and pretended to be me to get to her. 'Which means someone's trying to set you up.' Hello? Hey. How many days? Emma, you're exhausted. Please, let's just go inside... How many days was Rachel missing before they found her? Three, I think. So I have one more day. Maybe two. Emma, we don't even know if this is the same thing. I do. I mean, April is dead. I don't even know who else to talk to. Well, looks like the police are talking to Bryan as we speak. - I-I should get over there. - Uh, yeah, of course, go. - You're gonna be alright? - Yeah. Hey, I was thinking we should do this together. But why don't you check in with Mac? He lives, uh, three houses down by the old Smith barn. 'He's Bryan's best friend and he knows' what happened with Rachel. Okay, a-and you were saying he's been trying to get that site shut down. Yeah, he was. I, I don't know what happened, but.. Are you sure you're alright going alone? I-I can come right back after I work things out with Bryan. I'm sure. I can't sit around here and do nothing. Alright. You just be gentle on yourself today, okay? I already told you, I don't even know what that stuff is. Ketamine is a serious drug, son. You can really put someone out with it. So you're the one that found Beatrice that night? Yes, she was walking around the party half out of her mind, so I took her home. And as I recall, you were involved with that other girl, too. Rachel. Her name was Rachel. And you found her half out of her mind, too, didn't you? Yeah. No one believed her either. And now she's dead. - Hi. - 'Oh, hey.' I'm so sorry about what happened. Thanks. I know you and Bryan are good friends. Would you mind answering a few questions about him or the night of the party? Yeah. Yeah, sure, if it'll help. Um, come on in. - Thanks. - Yeah. Look, it all just happened so fast. I was looking for Bee, but Jenny told me she got angry and left. - And, uh, who's Jenny? - 'One of the cheerleaders.' She was my ex-girlfriend's best.. Do you think she could have been the one that drugged Beatrice? Jenny? No way. How does someone even get Ketamine? Pretty easily, actually. It's a club drug. Doctors prescribe it for depression. Any veterinarian would have it. Oh, my God! M-Mac's dad. Mac's dad is a vet. May I, uh, get you anything? - Some water? - Sure. - Thanks. - Yeah. - Is your mom home? - My step-mom? Uh, no, she's not here right now. - Here's your water. - Oh! Oh, my God. Ha. Scared me. - Thanks. - Please have a seat. So how can I help? Well, I-I was curious about Bryan's dad. - 'How did that impact him?' - Yeah. Well, you know, his dad got sentenced to prison and then his girlfriend committed suicide. 'Bryan's never been the same.' Oh, for sure. Did he find her or-or-or was it her parents? No, uh, the police did. Yeah, on the side of the road. Oh! Uh.. Oh, my gosh. I'm.. It's-it's fine. Um.. Let me get something to help clean it up. Oh. Um, may I use your bathroom? Yeah. It's, uh, down the hall, first door on the right. Thanks. 'You're right. It is mine.' Yeah. Did you know they were missing? No, and I don't know how he would've gotten them. He's never here. Have you noticed any changes to your son's behavior recently? Ever since his mom left, it's been hard. - When was that? - Almost five years now. Has he been, uh, argumentative or violent? He and my new wife Martha don't get along. We've been trying to work through it in therapy, but.. Dr. Wilson, please. If there's anything you can say that will help us.. Nah, his therapist was concerned that Mac might have violent tendencies. 'It's borderline psychotic.' And did you inform the school of this? No. That would have ended his chances of playing in college. We were hoping things would get better once Martha moved out. - And when was that? - Right before school started. She didn't feel safe anymore. Sir, a girl was murdered last night and another is missing. Do you have any idea where your son is? Oh, my God. You know what, with all this I-I think I should probably come back another time. - A-are you sure? - Yeah. Yeah, but thank you so much for being so helpful. Roberts here. Hi, it's Emma. I just left Mac's house. Emma, you should not be there. Hold on a sec. I'm sending you something. 'Sending what?' They were in a notebook in his room. Emma, look, I'm on my way there right now but in the meantime, you need to stay as far away from Mac as possible. - 'Do you understand?' - Yeah. 'Good. Go home and I'll meet you there later.' 'Please, anyone!' Is anyone out there? Emma? Emma? - 'Bee?' - Mom? - Bee, are you in there? - Mom! Mom, I'm in here! Don't worry, sweetie. I'm gonna get you out, okay? Hurry, please! I'm tied up. I can't get loose. Untie me. Please, hurry. Hey, I found something. I got it. Don't worry. - Did he hurt you? - No. I'm okay. Just tied up. Hurry, let me get you out. No! Mom, no! I gotta hand it to you, Emma. You and Beatrice do not go down easily. 'You know..' ...you're lucky she's such a fighter because do not know the things I would have done to her. - 'Where is she?' - Oh, she's safe. For now. Why? Why her? I knew the moment I laid my eyes on her.. ...she's got that, uh, tsk, you know I'm-too-good-for-the-world kind of thing about her. - God, she never did anything... - Exactly! She never even looked at me. She never even acknowledged me. I just wanted to take her down a notch. You should be ashamed of yourself. You're nothing but a sick.. Ah.. Uh.. You know, this is my favorite part. That moment right when the light fades from your eyes. - Are you okay? Yes. - Yeah. Are you? There's a knife in my back pocket. - Bee! - Ah! - Oh, my God. Let's go. - 'Ah..' - Ah! - Are you okay? - My ankle! - Look, w-we gotta keep moving. Ha-ha-ha.. - Hang on to me. - Okay. Let's go. Let's go. - Yeah. Come, come back here! - Let's go. - Mom! - Ah! Ah! Ah! - Emma! No. - 'No!' 'Emma!' 'Mac Wilson, you have the right to remain silent.' 'Anything you say can and will be used' 'against you in a court of law.' 'You have the right to talk to a lawyer' 'and have him present with you while you're being questioned.' 'If you cannot afford to hire a lawyer..' 'Who knew he'd bring you back here?' Well, he wanted to make it look like a suicide. It's the most believable place. And we're looking into the pictures trying to see if there's any missing girls who are a match. What gonna happen to him? We'll do a full investigation. And he's 18, so he'll be tried as an adult. 'And we need you two to testify.' - For sure. - Okay. We'll contact you if we need anything else. Uh, and I was wrong. Beatrice, I should've believed you from the very beginning. And, Emma, she's alive because of you. ♪ Wash your pain away so you.. Emma. Thank God you're okay. You are so, so brave. I'll leave you two lovebirds. 'Bee!' I'm so sorry f-for everything. It's okay. Come here. 'This is the first vintage of our heritage collection.' It's a Pinot Noir. And, uh, what I love about Pinot is that... Mom, please don't do the sideways speech again. I'm not doing a sideways speech but thank you.
