Not happening, Ro. Sis, please. I said no, and I meant it. Seriously? I'm 16, not five. I don't know these kids. And I need you to take Mary to dance class on Friday. I've got two clients for a color and cut. Yeah, you always have clients. How do you think I pay for your baseball equipment? Okay, do you think money grows on trees? That's fine. I'll just be the laughing stock of all the juniors. Look. I'm sorry, Ro. We need the money. I'm two years behind on property taxes. The bills keep coming in. Maybe we should start thinking about selling Dad's Mustang. It would solve a lot of problems. We're not selling Dad's car, all right? I won't go to the stupid party. It's no biggie, really. It's not stupid to want to hang out with your friends. Hey, maybe I can move my appointments? No, I mean, I've already started looking at other jobs, so... Your job is to keep a grade-A average and to get into a good college on scholarship. You can't keep working yourself to the bone. I'm fine. We've been going strong for three years now. Why change it? Maybe it's because you haven't been with a friend or on a date since... I can't even remember the last time I've seen you with a guy. I see guys all the time. Yeah, your yoga class? It doesn't count. Take care of yourself out there. You can count on it. - Bye. - Oh, wait, wait. Mary, come here. Your shirt's on backwards. Arms up. Good morning, San Francisco. Let's talk baseball, specifically Trent Fox. It's been a few weeks since the bad boy hitter from the Ports tore his hamstring in the last game of the season. The injury doesn't seem to have stopped him. Brian? Well, Gerry, there are those who say Trent Fox hasn't peaked. Wake up, you piece of shit. Ross? What are you doing here? Six weeks of recuperation, Trent, and this is what you have to show for it? You living in filth, man. Drinking? Smoking? Have you even gone to therapy yet? Ross, of course I have. Three days a week. Three other days I lift weights with Clay. Are you supposed to be lifting weights. Huh? What about strengthening, flexibility, stretching? Doc recommended daily yoga classes for you, Trent. You have got to snap out of it, kid. I mean, is this what you do with your time? Hell, I'm surprised you have one of your little girlfriends up in here warming your bed right now. Really? Maybe. Shit. Unbelievable. It's always the talented ones, too. Pills, liquor and endless fucking women. What else, Trent? What the hell else? Huh? I don't owe you any explanations. I'm on medical leave. The hell you don't! The way I see it, you got one of two choices. Either get your shit together or lose your contract. And with the way that you've been hitting, you're looking at an offer of 100 mil for five years. - Jesus. - Yeah. Jesus. Look, man. Coach wants you ready by spring training. I'll lay off the booze and the late nights. And you'll go to the therapy and the yoga. Yoga? Come on. Trent, you will go to a class or I swear by everything holy, I will drag you there my damn self. Fine. I'll go. When? Tomorrow. I'll go tomorrow. Promise? A man of my word. Prove it. Hi, Audrey. So good to see you. Oh, hi. Um... feel free to get into a child's pose and begin your deep breathing. Hi. I'm Genevieve or Viv. Is this your first class? Trent Fox. I'm here for rehabilitation. Pulled hamstring, right? Torn. How did you know that? My brother is a huge Ports fan. I can't believe you're here. Rowan is going to flip. Who's Rowan? My brother, the Ports fan. Anyway, I have an extended mat for you here because you're so hard. I mean big. Tall. You're tall. Okay. Follow along as best as you can and back off if anything puts too much pressure on the hamstring. And we can talk after class, if you like. I think I'd like that very much, Gumdrop. Gumdrop? Your lips are pretty in pink. Reminds me of a sugar coated cherry gumdrop. Oh. Hello, class. Please sit on your bottoms. Press your seat into the mats. Bring your hands to heart center. Let's close our eyes and begin by setting our intentions for today's yoga class. What is it that you want out of today's practice? Come up. Breathing as you rise. Warrior Two. Arms straight. Look at the wall. Windmill your arms into downward dog. Feet shoulder-width apart. There you go. Just going to grab your hips. Oh... That feels like heaven. Got a long way to go, but we'll get you there. The light in me bows to the light in you. Thank you, everyone. That was fine. Could we do that again, privately? Private classes? Whenever you're available, I'm down. Oh, well, if you can pay, I'm available after this class every weekday. There's a room open from 10:30 to noon. Which day would you like? All of them. Could you be more specific? I would like all of your time from 10:30 to noon, every day of the week until the end of the month. Every weekday? Doc says I need to do yoga five times a week. For once, I'm feeling cooperative. Did that fine man hit on you? Kind of. Well, he's beautiful. And you've been alone far too long. Oh, really? Oh, don't you have a class to teach, Luna? Don't you have a man to hunt down? Actually, I don't have to hunt him down because we have private lessons every weekday for the next month. He wants you! To help him recuperate. Oh. Mm-Hmm. Yeah, sure. Bye, silly. Ross. Well, I'm recovering from my first yoga class. Will miracles never cease. I booked private sessions 10:30 to noon every morning. Don't book a meeting. Roger that. Roger that. Hey, don't dip out. Oh, I wont. Trent. Don't fuck your yoga instructor. - No promises. - You need her. - I do. - To teach you. - And maybe more. - Trent, come on, man. There's just something about this one. I don't give a damn. I don't want to hear all of that. Trent, just keep going. Okay. Okay. I know I got this one on lock. Trent, don't fuck her, man. Goodbye, Ross. Trent! Guy's a fucking rabbit. Hi, Trent. Hey. What can I get for you? Just finished class? - Yes. - Was it Mila or Genevieve? Viv. - Ah. - Yeah. - She's pretty, huh? - She is. Well, I'm Dara. I teach meditation every morning at 7 a.m. If you ever want to connect to your higher self. - Really? - Yeah. So, what are you doing working here? My parents own the bakery. Everyone has to make a living. And I love it here. So.. I'll take two of the cinnamon rolls and three of those baby milks. I think they should come in adult sizes. I know. Are you having it for here or to go? I'll stay here. Oh, thanks. I'll bring it to your table. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Oh, it's Trent Fox. Hi. Thank you. Keep it real. Hey, Gumdrop. Wow. Finally. I was worried you might be into chicks. What? Yesterday. I worked them out like a mad man in spring training, and you didn't even bat an eyelash. So your pride got hurt a little? My pride. Nah. Well, perhaps you just caught me off guard. It's not every day a man undresses in front of me. Mm-hmm. Today we're going to work on range of motion. See where you're at now and determine a routine that will help loosen your limbs, okay? Okay. All right. Push it in as far as... Now, I want you to take your right thumb and put it on left nostril and inhale. Okay. Ah... Ooh. Okay, let's stretch. Other side. Come over and open your legs as wide as you can. You know how ridiculously beautiful you are? Other side. Okay. Right here. Yeah. - Oh, much better. - Good. Whatever it is you do, you gotta keep doing it. Like a Voodoo healer. I don't practice magic or voodoo of and kind. Okay, um... Now you... Are you going to tell me about the hotshot baseball player? He's nicer than I thought he would be for someone who has websites dedicated to his body. I mean, most women think he's hot. But what do you think? Every time I'm around him, I turn into a lust driven teen. There are worse things. I'm supposed to be helping him recover through yoga. And half the time I'm checking him out. So what are you going to do about it? Nothing. He's a client. Vivy, you know, you really... No, no, listen, it's not going to work unless I just want to have casual sex, which, incidentally, is what Luna suggested. Well, it's been three years since the breakup, so maybe you should. This coming from the girl who's all study, no dating. Does it feel right to you? It feels like something I just don't know what. - Trent Fox. - Trent Fox. Trent Fox? Are you guys talking about Trent Fox? That's my freaking idol. Go back inside. I'll be in there soon. Okay. Why? Ambers here. Hey, Row, Trent's your sister's new private client. - Amber. - What? Vivy, you have got to introduce me to him. Please. I'll do anything. I'll even mow the lawn. You already mow the lawn. Come on, please. Okay. Maybe after a lesson, we can invite him for a treat on us at the bakery. No promises. - And you need a haircut. - I don't. But you're the best sister ever. I got to make dinner. Something special for my awesome sister. See ya, Amber. You know, it's his night to cook. - Oh, of course. - Yeah. Yeah. Um. Okay. Hold that pose until I tell you to go into child's pose, okay? Okay. Viv, what's the matter? Child's pose. You're acting weird. Did I do something to offend? No, not at all. You've been more focused today than you have been all week. I was just wondering... If... Go ahead. Well, you can totally say no, but I was wondering if I could take you for coffee. Genevieve, are you asking me out on a date? Huh? You're asking me out. Oh, no, no, not exactly. Come here. I've been busting my brain trying to think of a way to ask you out, and here you are, looking all cute and nervous about asking me. That should not have happened. It definitely should have happened. No, no, no, you don't understand. I am not asking you on a date. But I want to take you out on a date. After this week's sessions and the kiss and... Pig! You just hit on me and I'm the pig? All right. I was wondering if after one of our sessions, you would want to meet my brother? Your brother? You have no interest in going out with me? Well, I wouldn't say that. I will meet with you and your brother tomorrow after our session. Then tomorrow evening, I take you out on a real date. I can't. Why not? - Clients. - Clients? I cut hair on the weekends. So when are you free? I'll have to check my schedule? Kiss me. You'll get back to me on that date. I can hear you thinking over there. What's got you so twisted up, Vivy? I am so sorry for bothering you in whatever it is... That you are doing. You're putting off some tumultuous vibes. How do you expect to teach a class like this? Sit. So why are you sitting on a desk? Getting perspective. You know, accounting is not my strong suit. And you have to sit on a desk to get perspective? To fully understand the problem, it is best to give all of yourself. So I inserted myself into the chaos in the hopes that I find a fix to my numbers issue. And did you get an answer? I did. To ward off negativity. It's beautiful. What was the answer, if you don't mind me asking? To hire an accountant. In the end, I realized I was not needed in the equation. Is the center doing okay? Better than ever. Speaking of... I heard you had a private lesson all week. Oh, whatever's going on in that head of yours is torturous to watch. Please share with me. Your mama's not here. God bless her beautiful young soul. You've got to work with what you have. Okay. My private client is professional baseball player Trent Fox. And yesterday I kissed him right here. I mean, not right here in Studio B, but now he wants to date me, and I'm going to introduce him to Row, and... I shouldn't have kissed him. Why not? Because he's a player and a client. We do not place rules on sexual attraction. We have tantric workshops here. Still, it's not professional. Love, sex, and passion usually aren't. But if this man gets your heart and root chakra humming, why not enjoy yourself? And what if I fall in love with him? Worse things have happened to you, my dear. And what if he just wants sex and not a relationship? Did he tell you that? Not exactly. He wants to take me on a date. And other things. And do you want these other things to? Oh, yeah. Well, looks like you have your answer. No, I don't. I'm more confused than ever. If you want to spend time with him, casual or otherwise, go ahead. You're a grown woman. Now, let's do a quick chakra readjust. Can't have you spreading this bad juju. I was trying meditation. Think I might take that hot chick's class this weekend. Hot chick? Works in the bakery. Dara. Then, you know she's hot. We will begin today with sun salutation. What did I do now? If you think my friends are so hot, why don't you ask them out? You're jealous. You can date whoever you want. There are some lovely ladies in and out of here. What am I going to do? Okay, boss, put me through the paces. I got a hot date that I don't want to miss. Vivy! Mary, what are you doing here? Are you feeling okay? Totally fine. Minimum day. Can I have a donut? Yeah, sure. Rowan, I'm sorry. I should have checked the schedule. Don't worry about it. I don't mind taking home little my sister. Yeah, but still... Rowan, this is my client. - Trent Fox. - Client? - What's up, buddy? - Oh my God. Rowan Harper. You're, like, the best center in baseball history. You play? Yeah, well, high school. Got the record for most hits on my team. Any scouts at the games? Perhaps, but I don't really care. According to his coach, he's got the best batting average in the state of California. Really? That's how I got my start. Well, I'm going to Berkeley, so... That's not the plan, bro. You're going to take the best package for your baseball career and your education. Can we talk about this later? It's better financially for us to stay local. Plus I already told coach to talk to scouts. You mean scouts are already asking about you? Yeah. All right. Can we get treats now? Trent's waiting. Trent will wait. Right, Trent? Yeah, babe. Do what you gotta do. Wait, are y'all dating? - Yes. - No. Don't put thoughts in his head. I can't believe this. After all they've done for you? You are going to set up a meeting with your coach and me, and we're going to discuss your options. How about we order some treats and we can chat about this? You can tell me what you've been told, and hopefully I can offer you some advice. Yeah. I know what he's doing. And what's that? He thinks he's doing me a favor. Giving up his dream to stay here and help. Where are your parents in all of this? Our parents died in a car accident three years ago, and I've been taking care of them alone ever since. And now he's going to throw away his dreams to stay here and help me. Babe, I'm... I'm so sorry. It's okay. Let's just go. - There you go, sweetie. - Thank you. You're welcome, babe. Hey, Rowan. Hey, look at me. I know you want to help this family and you do so much. A man takes care of his family. It's what Dad would have wanted. Yeah. And you want to be a pro baseball player, and you are so close. What about you? You were almost done with school when you had to help me and Mary. I'll still get my cosmetology license, okay? I'll open my own salon one day. My dream is not dead. Every baseball game that you play just proves that even though Mom and Dad are gone too soon, we're still alive. And we're fighting. And you know what? - I'm happy. - I'm happy, Vivy. And I get to go to dance classes. And you are a beautiful dancer. And maybe you'll go pro one day, too. And I want to see you out on the field giving Trent Fox a run for his money. You dream pretty big, Vivy. And so should you. You don't need to get a job right now. I told Coach, I'm looking to play at Berkeley and UC Davis. Mary will be 10. She'll need her big brother. Always. Thank you, Rowan. Hey. Hi. You're early. Can you hold this pose? Yeah. Well, that's good. Because we're going to test that right now. Okay. Oh! Yeah. Oh. Yeah. Oh. That was... Holy moly. We should try some other positions. My buddy Dash teaches a tantric class. Well, sign us up. You okay? What is it? I don't know what it is about you. You bring out something wild in me. Something wild and wildly unprofessional. Next time, we'll be more private. Next time? Oh, yeah. You and me Friday night. Plan to stay over. I can't. Why not? Two kids under my care. I'm not one of your baggage free floozies, okay? Babe. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have assumed. How about I take you out tomorrow like we planned? Okay. Hey, Viv. What are you doing standing out here looking all sexified? I'm waiting for my date. Would he happen to be tall? And could he possibly be the sexiest baseball player alive? - Uh-huh. - Oh, you suck. I was so going to hit on him. He is scrum-diddly-umptious. I know. - Gumdrop. - Hi. Dara. How you doing, beautiful? Nice. Not as good as you guys. You aura is just so red and shining so bright. It's blinding me. Wow. Well... You two have fun with that. Catch you next week for a couple of pastries, yeah? Sure thing, handsome. - See ya, Viv. - Bye, love. What does a red aura mean, anyway? It means love, passion, hunger, charged energy. - Hmm. - Stuff like that. She has a gift. You ever been here before? I spend almost all my time in Berkeley. So no baseball games? I've haven't been to a professional game in years. We'll have to see about getting you into the stands for one of my games, won't we? Don't say things you don't mean. Oh, this is a nice place. Yeah. Got to feed my woman. Your woman? Tonight you are. Two of the usual? Thank you. You look beautiful. Oh, like Dara? You're jealous? Just when a guy you're on a date with calls you beautiful right after saying the same thing to your friend, it kind of waters down the impact. Duly noted. Now, what's up with the siblings. I mean, why are they your responsibility? Well, my grandparents are dead. Both my parents were only children. I have my next door neighbor, Amber, who's also my best friend and her grandma. They help when they can. - And you stopped school? - Yeah. I was three months shy of getting my cosmetology license when the accident happened. And I have to take the last semester, and it's expensive. Your parents didn't leave you any money? Most of it went to the house. Property tax, the upkeep takes most of what I can make. Then you have utilities. Three mouths to feed, baseball gear, dance class. That takes the rest. So... thank you. I teach yoga and cut hair in my garage. Do people with money make you uncomfortable? What would make you say that? No reason. I know money is money. My parents were doing financially well before they died. My dad was a big time lawyer, but they were only 40. - You parents were only 40? - Yeah. They had me when they were young. So what about you, any siblings? My parents wanted a full house, but they just had me. My mom wanted more, but she couldn't. Oh. Tell me about your parents. My parents are great. Dad owns Fox Mechanics, which was my grandfather's, and Gramps still works there every day. And what's your mom like? Ma's the shit. She's crazy in her own way. But she worked for the Oakland school district for 30 years, and now she just loves cooking, painting, gardening and riling up my dad. You are lucky. I am. And, you know, they take every opportunity to boast about their son. They worked their butts off to put me into every baseball clinic under the sun. See, that's what I want for Owen. He thinks this family is his responsibility, and it's not. And I can talk to him for you. Man to man. You okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Really? You would do that. Yeah. Oh, you really are a nice guy. A nice guy? Yeah. You know what else is nice? Yeah? I only live two floors up. Hmm. Well, I take it all back. Maybe you're not really a nice guy. How long have you lived here? Five years. Pretty empty for five years. I haven't spent too much time in any place. You don't have any roots, do you? I'll give you a tour. What? That's a beautiful picture. - You think so? - Yeah. - Local artist. - Yes. Me. - Really? - Yeah. Well, that's something unique. - Do you like? - Yeah. - What was that? - My phone. Row? Vivy, I heard a noise. Lots of them. I think someone's trying to break in. - Should I call the cops? - Is the alarm on? Yeah, but the light in the yard hasn't gone off. Okay, we'll be right there and call the cops if anything happens. Okay, turn right here. Yeah, right here. Rowan? Mary! Genevieve! - Someone's here. - Get out of here! Get out of here! God. They're gone now. The cops will be here any second. All right, I'll go talk to them. I just got here with the owner of the house. Anyone else in the house? One female adult, two children. I haven't checked the place out yet, but there's two guys I saw run out the back door. All right, wait here, sir. We'll check it out. Anything I can do? Yeah. We've got to secure this window for the night. Got tools and wood in the shed. Lead the way. And when they got back from vacation... Everything was safe and sound and they lived happily ever after. It's a great story. - All right, bedtime. - Okay. Love you. Let's get you tucked in. Sweet dreams, baby girl. Hey, Rowan. I just wanted to say thank you for being here tonight and taking care of your sister. Anytime, Vivy. Just because I'm 16 doesn't mean that I'm not capable. Thank you, Rowan. - I love you. - I love you, too. Pancakes tomorrow? - Sure. - Sweet. - Good night. - Good night. And where's your room? Oh, you're not staying here tonight. Excuse me? The kids will hear you. They already know I'm here. Look, the house is not secure. I'm not going anywhere until it is. And I don't think you want me to go either. Just go to sleep. You're the boss, babe. Just sleep. Okay. Kiss me, woman so I can sleep. What? I want my goodnight kiss. - Are you serious? - As a heart attack. Oh... Fine. Okay, stop. Seriously. Not tonight, okay? Fine. Well, then hold my hand. I want to feel you close. Hiya, sport. Hiya, ma. I was thinking of coming over for dinner tomorrow. - Really? - Really. I want to get your advice on something. Everything alright with the leg? - Yeah. - Jobs okay? Jobs fine. Doing yoga, if you can believe it. So. Is it a woman? Yes, ma. It's a woman. Hallelujah. Come on. Ready for this? - Cool. - Do it again. It's so cool. Thank you, milady. Can you do it with eggs? Of course. Will you teach me? Yes. And the ladies love a guy that can cook. Okay, don't teach him your player moves. He's a good boy. Don't knock my moves, Gumdrop. Besides, a man should know how to feed himself. - Not here. - Ugh. Mmm. Coffee kisses. Uh, we're starving. Pancakes! Can Trent stay over every Saturday so we can make his pancakes? I just might do that. Uh, Trent, can I talk to you for a second? Yeah, always. Please don't confuse them. Genevieve, I don't know what this is between us, but it seems like all the rules have changed when it comes to you. How? Can we just see where this goes? Take this one day at a time? Yum! - All right. - Go ahead, eat up. So good. All, right. Pancake syrup for the lady. You got to try it with syrup. Right, from there... Clean it off and put it back. I brought sandwiches and lemonade. Oh. You're dirty. You're beautiful. Ugh, get a room. You know, you guys really don't have to fix the car. Nothing beats working with a bro. Right, Ro-man? Yeah. We're doing man's work. Leave us be, woman. Mmm. Delicious. And tonight's the night. No more waiting. You're on. The kids are staying at John and Kerry's. Good. I can't believe you did all this. Well, my goal was to get in your panties. Is it working? Oh, yeah, it's working. Eat first. Sexy time later. - Okay. - Okay. Ooh... What should we drink to? To fucking you silly. Works for me. You strip everything away, Genevieve. Let me. Ma? Hiya, Ma. This looks good. I told you I'd hire a gardener. I have a system. Let me get a look at my sport. Mm-hmm. You look happy today. Maybe that has something to do with your new lady friend? I think I'm happy. You think? Mm-hmm. I mean, Genevieve is different, Ma. Oh? She's not the type of woman that you spend an evening with and never see again. And so far, you've only dated women for a single evening. Pretty much. Are you going to see this one again? You could technically say I'm dating her. So what's the problem? I don't know how to date her. I mean, you know, the women I'm around aren't exactly the type that you bring home to meet the parents. Oh, my God. You're falling in love with her. It's too early and it's complicated. You know, I see her every day at Yoga. Last night, we took the next step. You're not used to wanting to continue to see a woman after you've taken that physical step. Yeah. Have you asked her out again? Not exactly, but I'm gonna see her tomorrow at yoga. She's making such a difference with my leg. Perfect. Tomorrow you ask her out again. Easy-peasy. Oh, it's not that easy. I mean, she's... - It is. - She's got obligations. Warrior two. Okay. Down into triangle pose. Swing the arms down into lunge... right foot back into downward dog with your feet shoulder width apart. Forward into plank. - Oh. - Are you hurting? Gumdrop, you keep touching that spot on my hips, I'm not going to be responsible for my actions. Sorry. It's better that way. Frankly, I'm relieved. Child's pose. What do you mean you're relieved? You've been tense and acting weird. I just thought maybe you were... ready to move on. Genevieve, this is more than one night. You know it. I know it. Hell, my mom knows it. Your mom? Yeah. She wanted to invite you for dinner Sunday. But I just didn't know how to ask you. Wow, Trent. Sorry. I just... I thought... You're you, and I'm me. Please come and meet my mom. Let's move on. Stand up. Ma. We're here. All right. Come this way. We're here! Hello, dears. Oh, look at all of you beauties. Hello, ma'am. I'm Rowan Harper. This is my sister, Mary and this is my elder sister, Genevieve. Thank you so much for having us. Oh. You have no idea how long I've waited to meet you. It is so nice to meet you, Mrs. Fox. Ma, relax. Everyone, this is my mother, Joan, and my dad, Richard. - Hi. Welcome. - You can call him Rich. Smells amazing, Miss Fox. We have a coloring book and markers for Mary. Ooh. Miss Mary, I love fairies. You do? I love when they have purple and blue wings. Totally. I'll color you a picture. Oh, what a lovely idea. And when you're done, I'll put it on the fridge. Babe, do you want a glass of wine or a beer? - Oh, no, I don't. - It's okay, Gumdrop. Ma's going to have some wine. Right, Mom? You betcha, Sport. Sport. I like that. It suits you. Always has. My big jock. Miss Mary, this is stunning. You are an artist, for sure. Thank you, Miss Fox. How about you call me Grandma Fox, huh? I'm old enough to be your grandma. Do you have any grandparents, honey? Well, now you do. How does that sound? - Sounds awesome, right, Ro? - Of course, Mary. Is there a restroom I could use? Right this way. What happened? Is she feeling ill? I don't know. Everything seemed fine. And then after he asked Mary to call you Grandma, her face turned white. Oh, shoot. It was me. - What do you mean? - Too much. Too soon. - I'll handle this. - Okay. Genevieve. Hi. Genevieve. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to come on so strong with your brother and sister. It's okay. It's just... Everything's so confusing right now. And here you are being so nice and... It just reminds me of a time with our own parents. Sweetheart. That's why we need to spend some quality time getting to know one another. How does that sound? Sounds lovely. But I don't want Mary getting too attached. Mrs. Fox, I... like your son. More than I should, and, um... He's admitted he's not really the settling down type. In the past. Not right now. What do you mean not right now? All I know is, dear, you are the first woman he's brought home to meet his parents in a decade. That's enough for me. I have pork chops prepared. Do you like pork? Yeah. Then prepare to be wowed. I already am. I'm going to run that bath in a minute. Okay, fine. What's this? Uh, property taxes. It's addressed to you. I know. I'm ready. Me, too. From now on, we look after each other. It's all going to be okay. I can feel it. Thank you, Dash. I'm so happy you found someone to help you unlock that root chakra. We were thinking about taking your tantric class, but I'm not sure we're ready for that. I understand and I'm happy for you both. It's a wonderful time for discovery. Let me know when you're ready. Keep your hands off her. - What are you doing? - That hurt? Seriously what were you thinking? I was thinking this joker better keep his hands off my girlfriend. Dash, I am so sorry. You're apologizing to him? Yeah, he's my friend and you just hurt him. I thought we were exclusive. That does not mean you get to go gorilla crazy on every guy that comes near me. - Seriously? - Viv, Honey, it's okay. No. This is ridiculous. You need to apologize. You know what? I've got a class to teach. Trent, I meant no harm. Viv. You two can spend some time together. I can teach your class. Best fucking offer I've heard all day. No, I need the money. I'll teach. You'll get paid. Dash. Go. Go. Genevieve, hold up. Please. What you did back there was completely unacceptable. Any man would have responded that way. It was a friendly peck. I can't believe you're turning this around on me. You're in there kissing Mr. Tantric, and I'm the bad guy? He has been really supportive during a very difficult situation. What situation? The bills are piling up. I'm behind on utilities and the property tax. The state is sending threatening messages. I can't lose the house. It is all we have left. Rowan and I have made a decision to sell Dad's car. But you guys love that car. And my brother and sister need a place to lay their head at night. And hot water and electricity. Something you'd never understand. What's that supposed to mean? It means you take everything for granted. There are a total of what, like two pictures in your house and you've lived there for years. I'm on the go. It means you don't settle down. And I'll tell you what's going to happen - after you go back on the road. - Enlighten me. You're going to find the next sweet thing and drop me like a hot rock. But you know me. The me I want to be. The me that shows up every day for yoga. I'm doing everything that I can to be the kind of man that you'd fall for. But why? Isn't it obvious? You could have anyone. Why would you ever want to deal with all this? None of those women are you. They don't make me want to work to be whole. And they sure as hell... don't make my heart squeeze tighter when I see a tiny glimpse of their smile across the room. Gumdrop... Hey, look at me. I can't, I'm too embarrassed. Look, I know that you're sad about your dad's car, but there's another solution. Let me pay the taxes. Thank you for the offer. But I am not your responsibility. What if I want you to be? Neither of us is ready for that. Okay. Well, guess what? What? We just made up after our first fight. You know what that means? No. - Are the kids home? - No. Get in the car. Mm-hmm. Turn around. Fuck. What? - Shit. - What was that? I don't know. I'm sorry. Okay, listen. I have never done that before, but it'll be okay. I'm not on the pill, Trent. Fuck! - Open the door. - Go away, Trent. The hell I will. You open this door right now or I will break it down. You wouldn't. - I can't afford to fix my door. - I'm so sorry. No stop. - Just sit. - Get off of me, Trent. - God. - I'm sorry. I'll admit I got lost in the moment. I fucked up. I mean, how often does this happen? Do I need to get tested? Are you implying that I'm a man whore? Are you admitting that you're not? I've had my fair share of women, but no. This has never happened before. If I'm lying, may I never be able to hit another baseball? I don't think I can handle one more life-changing mistake, Trent. We'll figure it out. You know, whatever happens, we'll deal with it. And if I'm knocked up and you're out on the road? Well, if you're pregnant, then we're parents. End of story. Like, I'll take care of you. No, not this again. I don't want your money. Whatever. Second round make-up sex? Is it going to be like this every time we fight? God willing. Okay. Just a few more seconds. You can do it. All right, big guy. Relax your belly on to the mat. Think Christ. Turn over. Just let everything go, you've worked hard today. Breathe into that pride. Now I want you to imagine you're looking down on yourself. The space around you fills with the color. What color is it? Red. That's your root chakra guiding you. Now I'm going to count down from five. When I get to one, you'll be awake and ready. Five, four, three, two... feel your body getting lighter. One. The light in me bows to the light in you. Genevieve... I'm in love with you. I love you. I do. It's too soon. I was in deep savasana and I realized something. That you love me? You asked me to imagine a color, and it became clear. And? The color was red. I've known since the moment I met you that your root chakra was blocked. - Why? - You're always on the go. You haven't had a committed relationship since college. Now I have you. So what does that mean? It means wherever you are is where... I want to lay down my roots. Really? Really. I love you, too. I can't believe you did this. You like it? You paid off my student loans and enrolled me in my last semester. I thought you wanted to finish. Now you can. Don't you want to open your own salon one day? Yeah. Shut up and accept the present. Can we show Trent our gift now? We all worked on it together. Let's do it. Here. Oh, wow. Okay... Okay. You want to help me open it? All right. What could it be? This is amazing. This is one of the best presents I've ever received. I knew you would love it. And I love my new jazz shoes. Okay. Okay. There's still a bunch of presents left under the tree, but I really want to give Rowan his gift, and I am going to be deeply offended if you don't let him accept it. Yeah, whatever, man. Now it's Christmas and birthday. I don't want your sister killing me for going overboard. Okay. Let's go outside. All right. Holy shit. Dad's 'stain? No way. Yes, way. Right, Mr. Harper? - Whoa! - Merry Christmas, sweetheart! Look at you, Mary! We have tons of presents for you. - Merry Christmas! - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. - Hey, son. - Merry Christmas. Did I do okay? You did more than okay. You gave us back Christmas. And you gave me back my life. - Come on. - Okay. All right. Well, it's the end of January. You know what that means for baseball? Not that much. Well, it's a month away from spring training. Could someone tell me where is Trent Fox? Brian? You can normally find him on Instagram with a lovely lady on his arm, Gerry. But no one's seen him. What is going on? Something definitely different about you, man. - An extra 10 pounds? - No, something else. You look good, dude. Skin looks good. You don't got those bags under your eyes. You don't got that signature scowl. And the leg, man, looks good. I am shocked. Everything's good, man. New chick every night, huh? Dating just one woman, actually. What? Wait, wait, wait. Stop. You? In a relationship. What's it to you? - She pregnant? - No. - What? Yeah. - Okay. What's going on? She's beautiful. Yoga teacher. She works hard, takes care of her family. For some crazy reason, she loves me. Good for you, man. Are you sure one woman's really going to be enough? Genevieve is more than enough. I figured that when you said yoga teacher that you actually went to the classes. Every last one. That shit is no joke. It's much easier to lift weights and run on the treadmill. Yoga's not for the weak. Ooh! Ooh. Yeah. Now you sound like your old self. Hell, yeah. My life is fucking amazing. Going to hit the Albatross pub with my buddy Clay to catch up and have a few brews. Don't hold dinner. See you tonight. Dude, thank you. Oh! Hey, Foxy. It's been a while since I've seen you out and about. Hey, Dawn Marie. Would you mind moving that hand? Now, why would I do a silly thing like that? I remember you liked what this hand could do. I'm sorry, darling, but I'm a one woman man now. Betcha I can make that one woman at a time. One woman at a time? Oh, no. Oh. I can't believe you. I have been up all night needing to talk to you. And here you are with your mouth on that bimbo. This is... this is not what... This is not what it looks like. Okay? Gumdrop. Don't call me that. I am nothing to you. Just the person who's carrying your baby. Oh, shit. I'm going to throw up. Dawn Marie was just joking, Gumdrop. She can have him. You don't take a hint. I need to talk to Genevieve. She's got absolutely nothing to say to you. I need to talk to her. Look, I didn't cheat. Kissing some bimbo in a public bar while your girlfriend frets at home waiting to tell you that she's having your baby may not seem like cheating to you, but to the rest of the world, I assure you, it is cheating. - Whoa. Look, lady. - Amber. - Amber. - Yeah. The best friend. I need to talk to her. I'm afraid that's not going to happen any time soon. Vivy needs some time. I suggest you give her that. Just please. Please, just tell her that I stopped by and to call me. Please. Maybe. She's not talking to you. I need to talk to your sister. Why? To make her cry some more. That's all she does is cry and vomit. You broke her heart. And usually when a guy breaks the girl's heart, it's because he cheated on her. So did you? It wasn't like that. I used to think you were the best thing that ever happened to me. The great Trent Fox. Now you're just a prick that ruined my sister. Leave us alone. Better yet, take him. I want anything from someone who hurt my sister to get into her pants. Hope the next girl you bang gives you an STD. Rowan! Rowan! Oh my God. Babe? Babe? Babe? What did you do? Nothing. I found her like this. My God, she's really sick. She's burning up. Okay. Watch your sister. I'm going to take her to the emergency room. She's not dressed. Grab the blanket right there. Hurry. Come on, baby. Call my mom. Get her to come here and watch Mary. I'm taking her to Summit Medical. Okay. Okay. I'll say it one more time. I did not cheat. That broad is a groupie. All right, look, I was drunk. - She was all over me. - Convenient excuse. Amber, I would never cheat on Genevieve. You say that now. But what about when she gets all big with her pregnancy? More of her to love. What about when you're on the road? I don't know, I'll hang out with the wags. - The wags? - Guys with wives and girlfriends,. And if she'll have me back I'll stay far away from any groupies. Does anyone want to hear what I think? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. You had me so scared. What happened? You were dehydrated. The baby's fine. The heartbeat's still strong. Oh, Gumdrop. Thank you for being here, Amber. There's no place I'd rather be. Can you give Trent and I a few minutes? You're right outside if you need me to come in, kick some butt. I think we'll be fine. Please, Genevieve, I will do anything to make this right. I love you. I love this baby. I want to build our life together. You, me. The baby, Rowan and Mary. I believe you. Yeah? And, um... And? I love you, too. Oh, thank God. Come here. Oh, careful. Are you okay? I'm coming in. Ports in Vegas this weekend. What a season Trent Fox is having. Well, I'm a Trent Fox believer now. Should have tore his hamstring years ago. Are you guys having fun in Vegas? Vivy, you have no idea. Tomorrow I'm going to go work out with the team and Trent got me a jersey for every game that they played a match. Did you thank Trent for bringing you along? More times than I can count. He's more excited about the trips coming up later this summer, huh? Why don't you go hit the pool? I'll talk to your sister. Sure. There's some serious babes here in Vegas. - Behave. - Always. Hey, love you, Vivy. Get on out of here. Have fun. Sorry. Just with Ross nailing down my new contract. But how about you? You know what I want to see. Do I have to? Come on. I mean, it's been a whole day. Fine. God. You are stunning, baby. You say that every day. How about this? Marry me. Same as yesterday. Any time. Time for what? I just don't want it to be about me being knocked up. Okay? Let's just talk about it after he's born. Is it he? Oh, my God. I am so sorry. I got the ultrasound yesterday and I asked the technician what it was between his legs, and she laughed. And I'm so sorry. I ruined the surprise. Are you mad? Am I mad that I'm having a son? No, I'm fucking stoked. Are you still seeing that root chakra red when you meditate like I taught to you? Absolutely. Genevieve. From here on out. When I'm with you, I'm home. I am going to go. Okay? Bye. Bye.
