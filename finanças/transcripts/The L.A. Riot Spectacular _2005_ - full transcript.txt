They're in the gate. - Here ya go, fellas. - Thank you. - Good luck. ("First Call" fanfare) - Let's get down! (gun fires) - And, they're off. LAPD car 390 breaks well, but the Hyundai breaks fast and takes charge at once. It's the Hyundai, with 148 now away in second, 505 is third, and LAPD car 390 is at the back of the pack.

This one's gonna be desperately close! Inside the final 15, 390 surges, the Hyundai, 390. Oh, car 390 has won it! The Hyundai nailed on the money in second and 148 finished third. - [Announcer] These results are now official. Entering the winners circle are Laurence Powell and Stacey Koon. Powell and Koon were bred in Simi Valley and are owned and trained by Chief Daryl Gates. - Len, are ya there? - Yup. - [Stacey] What's the latest odds? - [Len] High speed pursuit, it's three to one for Hispanic, even money for a black, 10 to one for a white, and hoo, 40 to one for Asian. - [Stacey] Three to one for Hispanic, huh? - No, Koon, never bet against black. - I'm not puttin' my money down on Asian. - But blacks are even money.

No matter who was right, or who was wrong, I'm here to tell y'all this shit was fucked up. Remember, Snoop has eyes everywhere. I'm goin' to share with you a classic, American tale. (fireworks explode) (moans) - [Officer] Officer under attack, hold on. Stay down! - [Dispatch] All units, black motorist awaiting beating, Crenshaw and Adams. Bring batons. - How did you get out of the basement?

Your broken bones are breaking rating's records. - [Announcer] Journalistic integrity? (scoffs) How 'bout a 23 share, douchebag? (speaking foreign language) - [Newscaster] Male viewers between the ages of 18 and 34 favor severing Koon and Powell's ball sacks with a hunting knife. - [Announcer] Trust us, we will dumb the story down, way down for you idiots. We're here to sell detergent. - [Newscaster] No commercial breaks here, fuck that. News as entertainment, we are up to a 29 share, passing Beverly Hills 90210 for the top spot, so we will play this video over and over and.. - [Announcer] Over and over and over and over and over. - [Newscaster] So if you haven't seen it before, we will run the video. - One more... time. Hi. Or maybe not. (variety show music) (indistinct chattering) - Everyone's talking about it, Harry, the hottest video in Hollywood isn't your typical movie. - That's right, Mary, it's on fire. And it's not your typical video rental, either. And tonight, the video star is out in force. Er, here, anything to say to your fans? - Look at me. I hurt all over. I hurt. Those officers, they gonna pay for what happened to me. Oh yeah, I want my come-uppance. I want a whole lotta money for what happened. I wanna be stinkin' filthy rich. Flying car, beautiful home, a white woman'd be nice, too. - Coming through. Pardon me. (camera shutters click) - Rodney means that every man should have a life filled with happiness. A huge injustice has been served here, and we will set out to correct it in a court of law. - We will correct it in a court of law. - Rodney, before you take off, America's asking, all of the world is wondering, what are you wearing tonight? - [Woman] You rock, Rodney! - Dickies. - That'll be all, thank you. - Woah, woah, wait. Excuse me. Who are you, anyway? - Your lawyer. (camera shutter clicks) - You're Jewish, right? - Yup. - Cool, just making sure, man. * I've got a Jewish lawyer, I've got a Jewish lawyer - I was beaten by the police, too. Aren't you going to interview me? - Was it caught on video tape? - No. - Eh, sorry. - Our viewers aren't interested in Mexicans. - [Snoop] Well, whitey may have started this shit, but our so-called black politicians, them niggers ain't much better. - Hold on, hold on. We have to wait and let the justice system run its course. (crowd jeers and boos) Please, please people, please. It's the American way. - [Man] Fuck the American way! - I probably could say something really derogatory about police and you would cheer. (crowd cheers) So, purely crowd fodder that has no basis in reality, right? - [Woman] I hate them, praise the Lord! - Okay, how about, to hell with those officers? (crowd cheers) - [Man] That's what I'm talkin' 'bout. - Er, the cops that whipped the black offa Rodney King's ass will pay with their white asses. (crowd cheers) Eleven-year-old girls have no hair on their vaginas. (silence) (camera shutter clicks) (speaking foreign language) (gun fires) - Hello, how are you today? (gun fires) Okay, pack of playing cards coming up. (gun fires) And a set of dice, and a packet of a sexual stimulant. Anything else? (gun fires) Ah, you want the good stuff. Well, here you go. Thank you, and have a nice day. - Attention bottom feeders. (crowd jeers) Mr. Rodney King. (crowd applauds) Fifty-six million is the number we're asking for. - [Man] Way to take those punches, Rodney. - One million for every blow. No man deserves to be treated like that. - You're probably asking yourself, why a Jewish lawyer? Sure, it's for the money. - But you truly respect the Zionist struggle. - Of course. Look at the history. Masada, Inquisition, and the Holocaust. Those traumatic events trained the Jews to protect themselves under laws. They developed a mastery over jurisprudence in response to their race being eradicated. Hence the term, shark. To be honest, I'm a sucker for a seder. That Manishewitz sure is sweet. - Now remember, we are brothers. - [Woman] I love you Rodney! - My people have been persecuted just like his people. (crowd applauds) - [Man] Mazeltov, old boy! Mazeltov! - [Snoop] The LAPD, to protect and serve. (laughs) Ain't that 'bout a bitch? What a crock of shit. - [Stacey] What's going on? - [Laurence] Where is everybody? (kazoo blows) - Surprise! (group applauds) - Well, boys, you know what this means. You've held a line against criminality and you've earned eternal honor. Your names will join the finest ever to wear the beloved uniform. It made the wall. - No. - Not the wall? - The chief will see you now. - Oh, Jesus. - Chief, I got the boys with me. Ready to see us? - Come on in. You made us proud. What you did was a textbook example of policing. Every officer should learn from your handiwork. I remember when I beat my first nigger, the cold, hard steel thrashing against his bones. Man, makes me wanna get back out on street patrol and find some gang-banger in a back alley. It's better'n good, rough sex. - Definitely, sir. - I agree, sir. - You are now a permanent part of LAPD history, the beatings of Mexicans on Bloody Christmas, the chokehold of James Mincey, and now your beating of Rodney King. - Congratulations. May I have your batons, please? - [Officer] This is such an honor. It doesn't get any better than this. Koon and Powell, this is it. (group applauds) - I'd like too thank Mr. Davis, my little league, my little league coach. His advice during batting practice made me first realize my... - What happened to all those guys on the wall? - They were either suspended or expelled from the force. - Think that'll happen to these two? - Already has, they just don't know it yet. Hey, I can't deal with all this pressure from the liberal groups. Somebody has to take the fall. It isn't gonna be me. (gavel pounds) - Sergeant Stacey Koon, you have been charged with assault with a deadly weapon, assault under color of authority, filing a false police report, and accessory after the fact to a felony. How do you plead? - Not guilty, your honor. - Officer Laurence Powell, you have been charged with assault with a deadly weapon, assault under color of authority with great bodily enhancement, and filing a false police report. How do you plead? - Not guilty, your honor. - Your acquittal date has been set for April 29th, 1992. This court is adjourned. - Think we'll get a fair trial? - Of course, why wouldn't we? - I don't know. People seem pretty upset about that video tape. - Yeah, but nobody saw the high-speed chase before Holliday put on the camera. Or the eight seconds of King lunging at you that the news media edited out. After all, this is America. - Yeah, I guess you're right. Your honor? Would you mind moving my car? My meter's about to run out. - Oh, toss down your keys. - Thanks. - [Man] Daryl Gates is a bitch-ass motherfucker! - [Snoop] I'd like to say something nice about the police, really I would. But I can't think of shit. Can you? - No appreciation for what we do, none at all. - Throwing Koon and Powell to the hounds. It wasn't a big enough bone. New Christopher Commission's all over this thing. We better do some quick study with their interviewer or we could be out of a job. - I am the chief of the most elite force in the world. I answer to no one. (gun fires) - What is this world coming to when we, the LAPD, can be investigated? Don't they realize we're here to protect? - Just think, this guy, Rodney King, is driving drunk with a criminal record, and we get the blame? (scoffs) What's next? (pleasant music) (gun cocks) (gun fires) (body falls) (pleasant music) (gun cocks) (guns fire) (gun cocks) (guns fire) (bodies fall) (gun fires) (gun cocks) - Hold up, man. Before you shoot me, man, can you remind me why we're killing each other? I know we both barely got education and can't even spell our own names. But damn, man, we gotta be killin' each other for something important, right? I mean, for all the brothers that done died out here, and for all the homies that's laid up paralyzed, I need to know, man. So tell me, brotha, what the fuck we killin' each other for? - Colors. - Colors? - Colors. - Colors? - Colors? - Colors? - We're killin' each other over periwinkle, motherfucker? - Yo, home boy, you want to call it a truce? - Why not? Hey dog, man, I raped your sister. I slit her throat. I'm sorry. - [Man] Shit, man, I carjacked your grandma. Tied her hands behind her back, made her suck my dick, and then kilt your granddaddy. I'm sorry. - [Second Man] I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry about blastin' your motherfucking cousin, nigger. - Ain't that a bitch? A gang truce, huh? I never thought I'd live to see it. Lift your drinks up if you're watching this movie in a theater or at home, and pour out a little liquor. It's the ghetto thing. Just play along. This one goes out to all the fallen soldiers out there. Ya got to do it. For real, motherfucker, pour it out. Now what really kicked this city's ass was this other video tape. A lotta y'all ain't seen it yet. But here we go, another shining example of racial harmony. - Go back to Korea! Go back to Korea! Go back to Korea ! Go back to Korea! - We're good people, church-going people. Hard workers, but these people think we're raping their community. - Let them organize their families to work for them like we do. Yobo, that's the American way. - I guess. (sighs) - Please try one of these. It's not half bad. - Stop it already. (speaking foreign language) - Booyah. - [Korean Man] See, you forget black people want to kill you. - Booyah. Booyah! (speaking foreign language) Booyah! - Booyah. - The media circus and self promotion surrounding the trial of Stacey Koon and Laurence Powell has made it impossible to conduct a fair and impartial trial in Los Angeles. So after careful consideration, I've decided to move the venue of this trial to the city of Compton. (hand slaps) Excuse me, my mistake. Of course, I meant Simi Valley. Simi Valley's the venue. Now, justice may be blind, but she is not deaf, and justice will be served, no matter how crazy the city gets. - [Announcer] We've just hit the 7th-inning stretch. Would everyone please rise and give an LA-sized welcome to our new hometown hero, the international symbol of justice, Mr. Rodney King. (crowd cheers) (baseball music) - [Woman] Scene 16, take two. Marker. (marker clicks) - [Director] And... action! - Get out of the car with your hands up, now. - Please don't harm me. Please, please. - You led us on a high-speed chase at 90 miles an hour. You could'a killed us. Do you even know the kind of trouble you're in? - I'm unarmed. - Oh yeah? Then what's this? - All right, cut. Somebody take this camera. - Okay. Cut it! - Cut, that's a cut. All right, let's reset it. Am I the only artist on this set? There is nothing real about any of this. All right? Your performances are full of fraudulence and self delusion. Now, don't you remember what we talked about? You must challengingly negotiate the audience, moment by moment, the way they live and feel things, in real life. I need this-- - Can we take it again? - Forget it! Forget it! All of you! I will be in my trailer until you all get your shit together! John Cassavetes, I'm sorry I let you down, man. Goddamn it! (camera shutters click) - We have completed our investigation. - [Reporter] Mr. Mayor? - And can now confirm that Simi Valley is, in fact, a part of Los Angeles. - What? - What! - But the venue change in this case is not an issue. The citizens of Simi Valley, though mostly cops, and entirely white, are fair and just citizens. (laughing) (TV airing foreign language) (laughing) - Hey, Tommy. - Dad? - Watch this. (laughing) (gavel pounds) - Your honor, I'd like to open my argument with the most indisputable evidence ever introduced into a court of law. This video tape will clearly-- - Counselors, no need to go on. We, the jury, find the defendants not guilty of all charges. - Well argued, counselors. (gavel pounds) (indistinct mumbling) (mic feedback reverberates) - [Man] What does he think he's doin'? * Fuck the police comin' straight from the underground * A young nigger got it bad 'cause I'm brown * Ain't that the n'other color, so police think * They have the authority to kill a minority - Ha! Ha ha! All right, all right. Chalk one up for the good guys, we won. We're gonna get there one judge at a time. * Hey fuck that shit, 'cause I ain't the one * Who'll pump a motherfucker with a badge and a gun * That be beatin' on - First Lakisha Hagans, now this? The pigs are gonna roast us. (speaking foreign language) - Let 'em know, let 'em know what time it is! Let 'em know! * Gold in the page and you're searchin' my car * You're lookin' for the product * Thinkin' every nigger is sellin' narcotics - All right, man! - Yeah! - Where ya off to? - I'm gonna play a little Lynch Bastard II at the arcade. Somebody beat my high score. * Finish, bring the yellow tape * To tape off the scene of the score * I'm still gettin' spoiled off bread and water - Fuck the poor, ha ha ha. - Mr. Holliday, everything fine with the table? - Oh, couldn't be better. - Good. - I just signed a three-picture deal. - Congratulations, Mr. Holliday. - Is she fresh? - Right off the bus from Iowa. * I don't know if they fags or what * They search a nigger down, they grabbin' his nuts * But on the other hand * Without a gun, you can't get none * But don't let it be a black and a white one * 'Cause they'll slam ya down to the street top * Black police showin' out for the white cop - [Rodney] Excuse me, caucasians, negroes. - [Lawyer] Gather 'round if you please. - Now y'all remember this shirt, don't you? - Oh yes, we do. - I know all of you are saying, there's no saving this shirt. But that, my friends, is where you are wrong. - We have an amazing new product to show you. - Now I am going to demonstrate how great this product truly is. I will take this shirt, and, voila! Voila. (crowd claps) Our prices won't be beat, like I was. I'm Rodney King. * Fuck the police * And the horse that they rode on * Fuck the police * Fuck, fuck, fuck the police * Fuck the police * Fuck, fuck, fuck the police * And the horse that they rode on * Fuck the police * Fuck, fuck, fuck the police (mic feedback reverberates) - [Announcer] This just in, the judge is also recommending Black History Month be reduced to a three-day weekend. (glass shatters) (indistinct shouting) (indistinct chattering) - Please, please. Good afternoon. I want to appeal to the citizens of Los Angeles for peace. (indistinct shouting) - Just one question! - Let LA be looked upon as the leading city, not just in the US, but in the world. (indistinct yelling) Please. Please! Please, set an example with your kind hearts and show the country what good citizens we are. (indistinct jeering) This isn't working on you, huh? (indistinct yelling) Okay, okay, well then, go ahead and riot. Riot in the streets! I can't stop ya anyway. You know something? I'll tell ya, the hell with it! Riot in the streets, I don't give a damn. * It don't bother me * When you cut me when I try and kiss ya * And scream for help * When I come home - Stop, woah-oh, woah! Ho, stop now! Ho, ho, come on, stop! Yo, stop! (truck horn honks) - [Reginald] What the hell is going on? - You stick and you move, keep your guard up, kid, and don't let them get a clear head shot. - [Reginald] Whatever this is, I'm not interested, okay? - This is your moment in history, kid. Now let's do the work the way I want you to do it, that's all I'm saying. Lock and load, you know what I mean by that? Lock and little you punch. Lock and load! - Ladies and gentlemen, this is the event you've all been waiting for. This is the LA riot. And now, introducing the contenders, fighting out of the black corner, weighing in at an average weight of 200 pounds with an average of six months spent in prison, we have the hoodlums, the Crips and the Bloods. And in the white corner-- - Look kid, you're in the wrong place at the wrong time. You know what I mean? But think of the bright side. You're gonna be famous. - We have the challenger, the scapegoat for over 400 years, the white injustice, Reginald Denny. - All right, boys, you know the rules. The cops got off, so there are no rules. And above all, I want to see a lot of blood! - Ladies and gentlemen, l-l-let's get ready to riot! (gun fires) - [Man] Get your white ass out of the truck. * Express yourself - [Announcer] Round one begins. Sometimes this is a tactical, feeling out process, but here you might expect the rioters to mount a full-scale assault from the beginning. Here's a left, and a right, and there it is, a solid kick to the ribs. These are wild, roundhouse punches being thrown here, no style at all, but they're finding the target, and with the riot brewing behind it, there are a lot of blows being rained on Reginald Denny's head. Already there's blood in the ring, early in the first round. Bang! Here comes the brick shot to the skull. Oh! That's normally a finishing blow. First-round action, Denny already bloody. This is a one-sided battle. Somewhere in the back of his mind, Reggie Denny may be thinking of fighting back, but then, of course, the back of his mind just got hit by a brick. - [Man] Hey, hey, watch me do the river dance. - Reginald Denny not returning fire at all. That's always an open invitation to the referee. And now this long line of would-be assailants with their chosen weapons will have to await the rematch because Reginald Denny has already been counted out. That's a first-round knockout for the rioters. This will not go down as a technical masterpiece, but it has firepower, it has passion, as is usually the case when one fighter is attacked by 30. - You crackers, won't be needin' this wallet. I'm about to go out and get me a whole MC Hammer outfit with the bubble pants and the dots. - Look out, Hollywood, you have a new competitor, the LA Riot Spectacular. The movie theaters are empty as everyone is glued to their TV sets. - That's right, Harry, the stars are fleeing their homes out of utter horror, while lawlessness has taken over the streets of Los Angeles. - That's right. - It's very exciting. - Yes, it is. - But one of the brightest stars to come out of this so far, is none other than newcomer, Reginald Denny. - There he is. - Reginald! - Reginald. - Reginald! - Can we talk to you? - Yoo hoo! Reginald! - Reginald, here, here. - Reginald, right here. Hi, listen, America wants to know, Reginald, what type of revenge do you wish on your attackers? - I don't have any bad feelings towards them, I forgive them for what they did to me. - Reginald, surely you must have some negative comments about the thugs who beat you mercilessly. Come on, give us the dirt. America is behind you. - I've been out of work, myself, so I can relate to the frustration, what they're going through. I just hope that the riots end soon so that nobody else gets hurt. - So Reginald, you thinking about no revenge at all? - None. (laughing nervously) - Well, I guess that's it. - Cut it, cut. That's really gonna help the ratings. - I don't think Denny has the star power that King has. - [Mary] No, he needs a lawyer. - I know, I'm not a white guy beaten by a black guy. Your viewers aren't interested enough in Mexicans, huh? - What are we gonna do with this guy? - I don't know. - Thank you. - [Mary] Gracias. - I'm not even going to ask. - [Mary] Gracias. (crowd cheers) - [Snoop] Don't you just get a warm, fuzzy feeling inside? I know I do. Damn, shit nigger. Ouch, that hurt. Watch out. Duck, nigger, duck. It's just like we're one big, happy family. - Dude. - Yeah, man. (indistinct talking) - What's a black ass nigger doing, coming up here driving a white limo? Man, you ought to be driving a black limo, nigger. Oh, shit. - Oh, Mr. Gang Banger, sir. - Get the fuck outta here. Can't you see I'm busy? - Well, we thought you might need some help. - Motherfucker help with what? - Well... - This beating. - Man, do it look like I need help with this beatin'? (grunts) (kick lands) - Okay, no, it's good, now hang on, but you realize that this riot is being televised live into millions of homes. If you really want to grab people's attention, the beating needs to be more entertaining, or your average viewer will flip the channel. - Man, motherfucker, I don't need you. This ain't the first time I been kickin' ass. I've been kickin' ass-- - Just give us a minute, and really, let us show you how. We promise we won't let you down. I recommend that you maybe use something that was very successful in a lot of the action figures' careers, the spinning high kick. - Good, Mary. - You like that? - The spinning what? - The spinning high kick, we'll show you. Mark, can you give us a hand? Mark? The spinning high kick comes to American cinema from the Kung Fu film. It's breathtaking to watch the midair aerobics, as your foot makes direct contact with his face. Let's watch. (kiyaps) (crowd groans) Fantastic, that's unbelievable. And the blood spurting out of his mouth is an added bonus. And believe me, by now, the viewers' hearts will be pumping. They'll be racing. (laughing) - That shit was tight as hell, man, but, damn. Hey, watch me finish this motherfucker off. - [Harry] Something is percolating up there. - Oh, I like it. - Woah, woah, wait, wait. - Woo, ooh, ooh, okay. - Step back for this one. - Ooh! Nice. - Death comes to all of us at some point, but your luck is mine. (gun fires) - That was electrifying. That is the only word that I can find to describe that. - Raise the roof. (indistinct yelling) - Our police have been late to deploy, but make no mistake, the men in blue are out there in full force and will have this thing stopped in no time. (screaming) They still keep law and order in our city. If that doesn't work, we're trying to contact Richard Gere to conjure up some phony peace-inspired, Dalai Lama bullshit. (indistinct jeering) Don't you laugh. It works on award shows. Huh? (indistinct whispering) Tell Gates he can blow me! - Get all officers in here now. That means everyone, sheriffs, deputies, sergeants, I don't care. This is a tactical recall. We are short of manpower. This nigger thing is outta control. - You know, I was thinking, it may be a better idea for us to start using African-American instead of nigger. - I beg your pardon? - I'm doing a little reading now that the liberals are gunning for our asses. Don't you realize where the word nigger comes from? - I can't say I do. - It is likely that nigger is a phonetic spelling of a white southern mispronunciation of negro. So when you use the word nigger, what you're actually doing is carrying on a mistake made by your forefathers. It's probably a better idea to use coon, tom, savage, pickaninny, mammy, buck, sambo, buckwheat, or jigaboo, although these days, most refer to black people as African-Americans. - Interesting. - It could help with community relations. - Well, we deployed our secret weapon, the SWAT team. If they can't handle these nig-- - African-Americans. - African-Americans, then nobody can. - [Officer] Watch the snipers. - [Second Officer] Move out, watch that roof line. - [Man] Get down, man, get down. - [Radio] Hey, sergeant, what the hell is that? - [Officer] Can we defeat that? - [Second Officer] Sir! Can you explain this, sir! - Retreat! Retreat! Retreat! Retreat! - Okay, I don't think they'll be back. (rock music) (girls screaming) - Yeah! Woo! Ooh, hang on. You know, my instrument sounds a little out of tune. (pipe dings) (man grunts) What do you think? - Sounds in tune to me. - Let's rock and roll! (rock music) - Hit me where it hurts, baby, come on! (indistinct screaming) - [Woman] Fuck me with your baton! - [Snoop] You know, I've never actually been to Simi Valley, and I don't plan on hanging there, either. That's the motherfucker that shot the Rodney King video. - No, peace, no! (indistinct yelling) Fuck it, man. My three-picture deal fell apart when the cops got acquitted. Supposedly this whole thing's my fault. - Mm-hmm. - I'm thinking about goin' indie. Build a foundation, get some credentials. I got a meeting with Jarmusch next week. - You should meet with Altman, too, man. - Man, you think Altman's still indie? - Definitely. - Man, I think Jarmusch is more indie than that motherfucker Altman. - More indie than Altman? - Hell yeah. - [Man] The man's institution. (speaking foreign language) (sighs) - Now this is ridiculous. How do we feel about all this? How do we feel about all of this? It's the liberal media. - It's the liberal media once again controlling the course of our destiny-- - [Father] Your destiny, yes. - And I will be damned-- - Damned. - If I let them use my blood to flavor their soy milk decaf lattes. - Good. Very good. (indistinct yelling) - We have no other choice but to call in the National Guard. I know what some of you are thinking, oh shit, not Cooper's boys. We don't have enough liquor and whores here to fill that appetite. But what other choice do we have, huh? Sure, sure, sure, I know they are a bunch of untrained weekend warriors, but they are our only hope. (indistinct yelling) We tried to get Gere, but his publicist said he was in the hospital (crowd groans) with a gerbil in his ass. (indistinct yelling) How does something like that get stuck? It's crazy. (military drumming) (military whistling) (cheering) (horns honking) (sirens blaring) - What's crackalackin' y'all? At this point in our story, looks like things are a bit out of control for the city of Los Angeles. Actually, it's fucked up. City of Angels, we just might need to reconsider that. But right now, niggers and niggettes, (sirens whine in distance) it's time to party. - [Newscaster] Breaking news, Chief Gates officially declares the LAPD is fucked up beyond recognition. More to come. - [Announcer] The top story, Mayor Bradley praises the gang effort to offer free heating for the homeless. - [Newscaster] In legal news, local hospitals are rife with opportunity for ambulance chasers. Law schools see influx from Israel. Bleeding-heart liberal sympathy for Mr. King has disappeared. Barbra Streisand declares the Kwanzaa holiday is bullshit. - [Announcer] In fashion news, Kevlar bullet-proof apparel, the latest rage on the runways. - [Newscaster] In culinary news, the roasted white skin of innocent bystanders is fast becoming a soul food staple. (glass shatters) - Korean barbecue! (speaking foreign language) - [Announcer] The future seems very uncertain. As for this newscaster, well, I'm outta here. Signing off. - Me, too. - To hell with this shit. - [Announcer] So long, LA. Nice to know ya. - Bye. - Buh-bye. - Adios, cabrones. - Goodbye. - Damn, man. Burnin' the whole hood down to the ground. - Yeah. Yeah. (laughing) (horns honking) - Too many non-black-owned stores are being burned down. We are going to start selling incense and beads. - Just got in this rare ubi from Botswana. (speaking foreign language) You can buy them in coconut shell or curry. (speaking foreign language) Do the tribal Zulu dance. - Again? (speaking foreign language) - Hey bro. - Right on. - You feel me? (sirens blaring) - I know what they sayin'. They sayin' this is all my fault, right? But I worked hard for that money, Steve, and I got the scars to prove it. - Yeah, I know. - I got the scars, man. - We need another plan. For now, to show our good will towards the city I've gotta decrease our asking amount to five million. - Five million? Five million? Hey, what's your cut, huh? I'll be left with bupkis, man. Bupkis. From 56 million to 5 million? Oh, man, come on, man. Something's up here, man. You know what? This is all your fault. I hate you! (bottle shatters) I hate, I hate you. I'm so sorry. I didn't mean it. How could I do this to you, you know? We've been together for years. - Rodney, Rodney, come on. (whining) Come on. Just what is it with these 40 ounces? Haven't you heard of the Nation of Islam's conspiracy theories? - What are you talking about, man? - You have got to start reading The Final Call. - Damn, you Jews are clever, man. God, man, it seemed like the only way to make money in this world, man, is to be a Jew. Hoo, hoo. - Mazel tov. How do you feel? - It's freezing. Is there any warmer water around here, man? - Rodney, we're trying to sway a decision on the settlement. I'll ask you again, how do you feel? - All right. Listen, I don't know about this whole Jewish thing. What's with the tattoo on the man's arm? What is he, a gang banger or something? - [Steve] You don't know what that tattoo is? - No, what is it? Naten now paru, Jerry's deli crip? I don't know. Seems like you Jews are just like us, European niggers. - Well, you could say that. (rock music) - What the hell is this? Where is everybody? Damn it! - Without us, there'd be no riots. - All right, the gig cancels, our big arenas sells. They owe us that, god! - No appreciation, whatsoever. - Give me a hand with this, will ya? - Move this. - Daryl Gates' a fuckin' asshole! I hate this fuckin' riot! (grunts) (spits) Fuckin' pissed. (yelling) - Hey, hey! - Hey! Hey! (whistling "Halls of Montezuma") - Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. (guns fire) (resume whistling) (indistinct yelling) - I did a little research and discovered a startling thing. This isn't the first riot in LA. - What? - What? - For Christ's sake! - No! - There was civil unrest in 1965. They called it the Watts riots. In fact, it was very similar, almost identical to this one. I guess history does repeat itself. (fiesta music) - Well, we's two-thirds of the way through this down here, and we Mexicans finally about to get some attentions 'cause we painted black on our faces, huh? The media gives all attention that there is to black folk and we Mexicans gets none. It ain't fair, I tells ya. We outnumber blacks three to one in this here city. And by watching television, you would think we didn't even exist. Huh? Bitching. - Well, well, how did they knife you, huh? How did they knife you? The Korean. The Korean get all kinds of attention from you media, and us Vietnamese, us Vietnamese have none. It's not fair! Not fair, damn you. - Otto, Otto, Otto. What about us Armenians, huh? We get no attention whatsoevers. We, the minority of minorities. - We, the minority of minorities. - No, no, no, we are the minority of minorities. - No, no, no, no, no, we, the minority of minorities. - No, we the minorities of the minorities. - [Snoop] You remember what you got during the riots? Shit, I got a Magnavox 27-inch. He looks real concerned. Keep up the good work, officer. - So the term African-American was actually a politically correct term, invented to give blacks a connection to their history. - Right. - And the psychology behind rap artists and street kids using the word nigga is to demystify its use when white people use it, kind of, taking the word back for themselves. - You are getting good. - And, our iron fist policy should be abandoned and replaced with a deeper community approach and empathy for the underlying causes of urban strife. - Sounds like you're speaking from the heart. - Am I ready for the Christopher Commission? - They will eat that up. - Will we get to keep our jobs? - Your kingdom is secure. (stately music) - Mr. President? Mr. President? If I can ask one question, sir. - A tragic series of events have occurred in Los Angeles that include frustration over a verdict. We are concerned about any question of excessive police violence, and we are equally concerned about excessive public violence. The murder and destruction in the streets of Los Angeles last night and today must be stopped. I urge all Americans to approach this situation with calm, (vehicle crashes) with tolerance, (indistinct yelling) (gun fires) and with a respect for the rights of all individuals under the Constitution. - Get down, get down, get down motherfucker! Get down! - Thank you very much. (indistinct questioning) - Eh, well, nigger still can't get a break, especially in the White House. The plot thickens. - Left, left, left, right, left. Leg, turn, halt. Private Kim, what are you trying to do to my beloved corps? - I don't know, sir! - You are dumb, Private Kim. Do you expect me to believe that you don't know left from right? - Sir! No, sir! - You did that on purpose. You want to be different? - Sir! No, sir! - Don't fuck with me again, Kim. Let me hear the war cry. (yells) The LAPD is offering no protection in this war. They want to attack us, we will be good and ready! (gun fires) Now, platoon, march! * Dolly Parton has no breasts * She has mountains on her chest - What do we want? - Justice! - When do we want it? - Now! - What do we want? - Justice! - When do we want it? - Now! - What do we want? - Justice! - [Man] When do we want it? - No justice, no peace! - Never been a change of venue. (laughing) - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. - [Snoop] Here it is, folks, that melting pot you always read about in school, one nation, under fraud, divisible, with oppression and injustice for all. Shit. - We just got word that the teenage lesbian handicappers have joined the rioting. - No justice, no peace! - Are there really teenage, lesbian handicappers? - [Woman] Fuck the police! - You want me to be honest? - Yes. - I'm out of ideas! I don't know how to stop the riots! - [Man] Well, no shit! - Look, look who's here. They are best known for their hate-mongering, immigrant-harassing, violent, drunken behavior. Let's welcome the Aryan youth! (indistinct jeering) Our champion! They're best known for their brutality against minorities, their us-against-them mentality, and their Simi Valley addresses. Let's hear it for the LAPD! (indistinct jeering) Is everybody ready? Then, let's play the Feud! Name the most hated ethnic group. - The niggers! - Woah, he said niga-niga-niga-niga-niggers! (game show beeping) - Stand up for what's right! Stand up for us! - There's still a number one answer up there. - I think I got it. It's gotta be the chinks. - He said, the chinks! (game show beeping) (indistinct yelling) - [Woman] No, the bastard. - You gonna play or pass? - We should play, play. - You got an answer for me? You little baby Hitler bastard? - Faggots. - He said, the faggots! (game show beeping) Yes! - Yeah. - We got two answers up there left, Ho Chi Minh. - Um, our next-door neighbors, the spics. - Oh, she said wetbacks. - [Woman] Not wetbacks. I said spics. - [Man] It ain't number one, though, it ain't number one. - Okay, now there's only one answer up there left. - I'm ready to play. - You, you, you got to give the gangs a chance to steal. - [Man] All y'all motherfuckers goin' down. (cheering) - Do you have any idea who is the most hated ethnic group? (indistinct jeering) - Kikes. - [Man] White people! - Gee, this is a lot more interesting than anything Hollywood comes up with. - It wasn't easy choice, man, but, we goin' with the kikes, man. - If it is up there, you are the new Family Feud champions. Show me the kikes! (triumphant music) (cheering) - Excuse me! May I have your attention please? I have somebody here with a very important message. Rodney Kingstein. - [Man] What a sellout, man. - [Second Man] Fuck you, Rodney! - Even though we were fighting one another and just hatin' one another, we burned down our neighborhoods and-- - [Man] You sound like a bitch right now! - Can't we all just get along? (gentle saxophone music) - No. - No! (gun fires) (screaming) - [Man] You can't stop me! (glass shatters) (yelling) - I didn't vote for you, anyway! (grunting) (indistinct yelling) (guns fire) - Damn. Shit, nigga. - Where's my money? - You can trust me. - Yeah, I can't trust you as far as I can throw you, man. - [Man] I'll fuckin' kill you! - Oh, oh, oh! - They're really mad, chief. What are we gonna do? - We should start calling it the LA Uprising. It has more sophistication and better represents what our brothers are going through. - [Woman] Take these damn handcuffs off. - It's so unfair. It trivializes the black experience and the importance of what is happening. Riots, sounds like a bunch of wild bushmen terrorizing white people. (indistinct yelling) - You put your mind to something, you are undeniable. - My brothers! We are with you! No justice, no peace! (indistinct rioting) - [Group] No justice, no peace! No justice, no peace! (guns fire) - Sucker! - Die! (yells) (gun fires) (rock music) (siren goes off) (building music) - Harken all ye Israelites, the Lord of Hosts who do battle for us, behold his mighty hands! (laughing) I always wanted to say that. That's Charlton Heston, Ten Commandments. De Mille's my favorite director, absolutely my favorite. I'm sorry, I'm just rambling on here. I'm rude, I should've been introduced myself. I am the chosen representative of the people of the hills, that's the areas including Beverly Hills, Hollywood Hills, Bellaire, Brentwood, and Malibu, although Malibu isn't officially in the hills. But basically, that's all the rich people in LA. Now, this riot is ruining our lives. We let it go on long enough, but it can't go on any longer. These facades of our mansions are messy, because the Mexicans have stopped trimming our gardens. The blacks have crossed over the imaginary border we created with the 10 freeway. And the cops, well, they don't even have time to slap us on the wrist for wife-beating anymore. Worst of all, our beautiful views are full of smoke. We can't have that. If this riot doesn't stop this instant, we will get furious. And we will stop the drug pipeline from South America into the hood. - [Man] Oh no. - We will plug up the border for good, even if it means losses to our annual income due to cheap labor, and we will scramble cable for you lazy white people. The people of the hills have spoken. Now, if you'll excuse me, I I've gotta finish my massage. I'm sure you'll clean this up by the time I finish. (solemn music) I said, get on it! Get on it! - Ooh, me love you long time. (triumphant music) - West side, beyotch. - All right. - Now I want you guys to come on over here, shake his hand and make up. - No, I'm not shaking any hands. No, they really tried to hurt me. - Just because we beat the hell outta you, doesn't mean we don't care. - Can we at least be friends? - I guess we can be friends. - Oh. - All right, man. - Wait a second. Hey, Koon. How did you wind up with such a racist name, in the first place? - [George] Hey, hey, hey, enough. Get this shit cleaned up already. - I'm gonna let it slide. Let's go, man. (rhythmic piano music) - What's going through your mind right now? - Why, anger. It makes no sense. This didn't help the community. It didn't help anyone. - This is dumb! This is not fair! This is not fair! - He took me to the police car. I don't remember nothing because I lose my mind. - I don't believe it had anything to do with Rodney King. - I never thought I'd be doing this, in this capacity in my own country. - Look at this here, we lost everything here, right? No, no, we can't imagine this one. - This Rodney King thing is not the issue anymore. Personally, I think all four cops should've gone down. This thing is opportunist. - Why have you destroyed my business? Why destroy my store? I tried to make it! - Well, we've reached the end of our story. Numerous efforts and millions were invested into south central after the riots. So as far as that question, can't we all just get along? Well, as you can see, not much has chnaged, and south central still hasn't recovered. - [Officer] Officer under attack. We have an officer under attack! - What, you thought it would? Stupider than a motherfucker. What's happening gov? Sitting back, checking out the motherfucking gang. Seeing all these suckers claim to be gangsters, wanna be gangsters, rappin' gangsters. But they ain't puttin' in no motherfucking work. They show, it's real shit.

Can ya dig what I'm talkin' about? In a real motherfucking way. Peace. * April 26th, 1992 * There was a riot on the streets * Tell me, where were you * You were sittin' home watchin' your TV * While I was parked in some hatin' * And some anarchy * First spot we hit was my liquor store * I finally got all that alcohol I can't afford * With red lights flashin' - It ain't no use. Shit don't ever change. Rich get richer and the poor get poorer. Same old fucking story. - They didn't rebuild our communities after the '65 riots, why should they do it now? Guess we can look forward to lives of crime, poverty, (gun fires) Why? - Aw, nigga, the riot's over. Shit, besides, I'm gonna need some kind of conflict in this city for the media to grab onto. (gun fires) * It dawned on me that I need new home furnishings * So once again we filled her van * Until it was full * Since that day my living room's * Been much more comfortable * 'Cause everybody has had it up to here * It's getting harder and harder and harder * Each and every year - Use tanzonite, it seems to get the oscillation going in my joints just right. - How about sunstone? - Yes. Sunstone will work. - Matthew Lerman. (cheering) - Listen, Mr. Lerman, I've been meaning to ask you, if you might be interested in investing in a spec idea I have. I want to turn the LA riots into a comedy film. I mean, it'd be totally outrageous. People will love it, they'll hate it. It'll be bigger than big, and you know what the best part is? No one's ever done anything like it before. - Just get my grandson's face on tape, you moron. - We will never forget what happened. - Do you want to go back to Korea? Hm? - Not just yet. No rent, electricity, or phone bills. Honey, Yobo, let's make some money. Then we'll go back home in style. - Last call, sister. - White conspiracy. - Last call. - You may recognize me as Daryl Gates, but my new name is Sharif Abdul Ismir. - And my name is Abdul Allam Sedan. - Please buy our newspaper, brother. In it you will read the sins of the white devil. Ketchup begins with the letter K, so guess who invented ketchup? - The KKK. - If you buy this paper, you will see how the bloodsuckers have used ketchup against our people for thousands of years, ever since Dr. Youkun. - I'll take one, brother. - Peace brother. (speaking foreign language) - Last call! - Cheer up, son. Look, I want you to understand that it's okay to believe in racial purity, regardless of how people are feeling right now. Okay? - Sure, dad. - Now repeat after me. We're from pure Nordic loins. - We're from pure Nordic loins. - We're the race in first place. - We're the race in first place. - Good. (indistinct talking) - I am a nightmare walkin', psychopath talking. (tires screeching) - Watch out, baby. Ow, watch out! A tree! Who put that there? Who put that tree there? (burps) (indistinct mumbling) Treat me like a king, know what I'm sayin'? (mumbling) This is for all the brothers who had to suffer just like me, you understand what I'm sayin'? Watch out, baby. Why, what can I say, what can I say? (mumbling) Woo!
