Now little Miranda Mae Whatley has won the scripture memory contest this week. Come on up here, young lady, and tell us the verse you've learned. Jesus said, "A new command I give you:" Love one another. As I have loved you, "so you must love one another." John 13:34. Praise the Lord. Bless your heart. [Applause] Glad to have brother Noah back this week. He's been down in Mobile at the Church Innovation Conference. Looking forward to hearing all about it, Noah. Speaking of innovation... I want ya'll to be prayin'. Plans are underway for the Youth Center and Multisport Complex. Gonna be a powerful tool to reach the young folk! Can I get an Amen? Amen! Praise the Lord! NOAH: Great seein' you! Thanks for comin' out. Love that color. Brings out the blue in your husband's tie. But you know what, Brother Bob, I did want to talk to you about a few ideas I got at the conference. Some real innovative things going on... Well, Brother Bob, that was one humdinger of a sermon you had there. You were steppin' all over my toes on that one. Now Jerry, that's the Holy Spirit speakin' to ya'. Brother Bob, where's that lovely daughter of yours? I haven't seen her in the longest while. Emily. Emily. She's finishing up volleyball season at the junior college. All conference this semester. I Suwanee to goodness, Old Fred's gonna bring that goat right into the church service one of these days. You know, Miss Jenny, we gotta give Old Fred a break. He's just not been the same since he lost Evelyn last year. Bless his heart. See ya next week. Sure But yeah I was thinkin' maybe we could do somethin' to.. A word with you, Pastor? Of course. Mornin', brothers. NOAH: Got somethin' to check on. Numbers were pretty bad this mornin', Brother Bob. Attendance is barely 150. We haven't broke 200 since Easter. Looks like offerings won't even cover expenses this month. I keep tellin' ya. Situation's getting desperate. We can't keep the doors open at this rate. Wasn't like this in your daddy's day. No sirree. [Reggae Organ Music] Brother Bob! There you are. [music: "Amazing Grace" You know, you can get in touch with people a lot easier if you get a cell phone. I am more interested in the unblemished word of God than I am in unlimited texting. Well, I can't argue with that but this is more than just texting. I've got three different translations of the Bible on here. So... Look, anyway. I came to talk to you some more about those ideas I got from the conference. Listen to this: There is a church in Nashville, Tennessee, putting on Christian rock concerts. And a group in Texas - they're making a movie, Brother Bob. Reaching thousands for the Lord. And they paid off their Fellowship Hall, to boot. Now tell me that is not a way to reach the young folks. ♪ You know, Miss Judith, maybe there's something you haven't considered. AUNT JUDITH: Oh and what's that? Well, about the land. Your land. What a blessing to the community our Youth Center and Multisport Complex would be on your land. Are you sure I can't get you and the Mrs... Oh, I'm sorry, it's um...? It's Esther. Esther. I can't get you something a little stronger to drink? You're secret is safe with me. Well, I was kinda wonderin' about that. Oh, we can get you one of that! Oh... BELLA! Bella could you... BELLA! BELLA? You know what? We're fixin' to go. My Lonnie used to say that. Say what? Fixin'. Fixin' to do this. Fixin' to do that. Never fixed a thing in his life. Now, was Lonnie you're departed? Number three of three. I met him at the craps table on a Viking cruise to Belize. Oh my! Now, was he Jewish, too? ESTHER! (laughs) No. Reform Pentecostal I think he said. Married me the very next week and brought me here. Three months later he dropped dead of a heart attack sittin' on a Port-a-potty out at the mill yard. Oh! My goodness. Bless your heart. Miss Judith, do you need some time alone? No. That's all I've got. Time alone. In fact, I was... BELLA! Bella make... What do you like, honey? Peach? Mango? I like peach. Bella would you mix up a pitcher of peach margaritas? Salt? No salt? Salt? You know at the church, umm... we've just been prayin' for this land. I was just wonderin' if something that... Bella did you get that? Maybe move this process along, because I understand that you have quite a few parcels. Are you alternating those rows? The red and the white. The way I asked you to. Have any children, Miss Judith? No. Miami to New York. New York to Miami. Never had time for kids. Just Josh. Josh? My youngest sister's boy. He's been my golf buddy since he was a little kid. Bought him a set of golf clubs for his Bar Mitzvah. So where is Josh now? In New York. In film school. [Honking horns] What I want to know is, do you have any basis in reality for that? Only that it's true. One piece of proof. Just give me one. Its what I grew up belivin' And where'd you grow up? Queens. That's my point right there! Martin Scorsese? Man, you don't know anything about film. Hey Blume, who shoots New York the best? And wait, before you answer, please don't name the great New York Knick cheerleader Spike Lee just to blow up my dress. Go. Woody Allen. Manhattan. See that's the obvious choice, man. Hold on. Or are you saying that cause he don't like to put us brothers in his films? Allegedly. Oh you know who I'm forgetting? Ivan Reitman. Ghostbusters. A chilling vision of New York as we hope it never is but fear it may one day become. Alright, Mr. Comedian, since you wanna talk about chilling visions. When you gonna finish film school, huh? When you gonna do that? Join the chorus. Aunt Judy could use some backup. You know why I help her sing? Because if I was paying your freight like she is I'da kicked your butt to the curb a long time ago. Get outta here. So what? You gonna be the next Spielberg? Yeah somethin' like that. I gotta finish my thesis film first. And it's due by Thanksgiving, man! It ain't gonna happen, man. Just admit it. You know, my young associate has been talkin' about us makin' a movie. A movie? Here? With your church? Yeah he says it's the next big thing. Maybe your nephew could help us with it. I'm not sure that's a good idea. I mean, he's probably very busy in New York in film school. Oh, I dunno. I think I could convince him. (sigh) Well, that's very nice. I don't know. I mean movies are expensive. Church doesn't have THAT kind of money, if you know what I mean. Plus, the Lord has laid it on my heart to build this Youth Center and Multisport Complex. That's why if we can just buy that land and start buildin', I think it's just what we need to get things goin'. How much? We're thinkin' 50-thousand dollars. Where are you gonna get 50-thousand dollars? Mam? Listen, its a small town. And people talk. Everybody knows your church is on the skids. I'm not sure I'd put it like that. Put it anyway you want, but I mean you'd be hard pressed to spend 50-thousand dollars on the land, much less build that, what was it again? Youth Center and Multisport Complex. Whatever. Yeah. Well, you know Miss Judith, not that you would have any reason to know this, although you do seem to know quite a bit about our church. That building was my daddy's vision. And when he passed away, he left us some money in his will and we've been savin', and adding to it. And times are tough, you're right. But I think if we could just build that on that land, your land, it'd be the spark just to get us goin'. I'll tell you what I will do. I'll give you that land. And you take that 50-thousand dollars and you make that movie. But here's the deal. My nephew is your director. ♪ Maybe God IS providing a way. Seems like a really clear sign from the Lord, Brother Bob. [Stapler crunch} Well, one thing's for sure, if we don't do something we're BOTH gonna be flippin' burgers [crunch] at Connie's soon. Maybe God wants us to be in the movie business. I can even help out, ok? [crunch] Shoot a [stapler] shoot a 'Behind the Scenes' video, use it to draw in the young people, you know? [stapler] Do Facebook, social media, the whole works. Not a bad idea. Help me keep my eyes on things and smooth things over with the board [stapler] I know they're not too keen on this idea. Brother Bob, you can count on me. [stapler crunches] You know, I don't know what I'd do without you, Noah. If God is my co-pilot, you're kind of like my air traffic controller. [stapler crunch] Can I get an Amen? Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord. In fact, someday, this could all be yours. Oh, Amen...

Actually, Forsythia, my secretary brews the coffee. So She-Brews. Josh, this is Guy Sheets our church treasurer. He'll be watching the money. And Ted Dowdy and Harvey Mears, our Board members. Nice to meet you. And Noah Thatcher, our youth minister. Miss Forsythia, refill on coffee please. So, I know Josh is anxious to begin working on the movie, right Josh? Yeah. Fifty-two years a Pastor's secretary and I'm still pouring coffee like a truck stop broad. So Josh, what have you done that I've seen? What've you seen? I've seen... I've seen stuff. I've done stuff. Hum! You know I'm pretty good with a camera myself, actually. Shot a few Bible study videos for the youth group. Big hits. What? We're a little new to this Evangelistic movie business. Brother Big Bob was a down-the-line old time religion man. Yep. Never try to outrun the Lord, was his sayin'. Those were the good ol' days. That they were. He was thinkin' all the time, too. Ya know, it was his dream to build that Youth Center and that Multisports Complex to keep the kids from goin' up to Birmingham and Montgomery as they graduate. Isn't that right, Brother Bob. Sometimes, we just have to ask ourselves, W.W.B.B.B.D? What would Brother Big Bob do? [Bell Ring] Oh, sorry. Let me help you out with that. [Scalding sound] OOHH!! HEY!!! Fiddlesticks.

You know who would love this dress? Mama! Esther! Even in high school, I remember your mama was crazy about Jackie Kennedy. When's her birthday? How much is my employee discount? Oh, we'll give you a good deal on this one. Too bad she can't actually wear it anywhere. Oh, that's right. Your daddy does keep a tight lid on the fun factor, doesn't he? That man could suck the fun out of a clown car! Yes, he could! Geoffrey, why didn't you ever leave? You want me gone or somethin'? No. But really? What? Homer? I did. College in Birmingham, then moved to Tampa, then Mama got sick so I came back home. Bim Bam Boom. Back in my room. My story. The End. Do you ever feel... Stuck? Stuck? Naw sweetie. Not in my nature. Why don't you go on to Troy and take that volleyball scholarship? I mean like LEAVE LEAVE. Like Richmond or Chicago? Besides Navy Pier and Nordstrom, what's Chicago got? Oh you know, Uncle Steve and Aunt Verna moved up there last year and my sister Missy's in Richmond. I miss her. She doesn't get home much. And that surprises you because? I dunno, I just... I just think I need... out. What does Brother Bob think about that? To tell you the truth, I wouldn't know. Daddy's got other priorities. ♪ No, no, no. You're doing fine, Carlton. Well just, take him aside, open up your Soul Winners New Testament, and lead him down the Roman road of salvation. Ol' Carlton's got a lost plumber working on his septic tank. Tryin' to bring him to Jesus! Yeah! Well, I mean maybe, maybe tell him that the Lord will pump the sewage out of his life! I mean of course, after he cleans up a bit. Umm, right well. You know what?

Now, Josh, before we get started, I'd like to ask you a question. If you died tonight, do you know where you'd go? New York. I'm talkin' about your soul, son. I mean we're all gonna face it one day. But you don't want to face that day without a personal relationship with Jesus. Yeah and you know, I don't really have one, so maybe I'm not the right director for this movie. No, no, no... Now, I gotta tell ya. I've been fastin' and prayin'. I can see the Lord rainin' down His power. I've asked the Lord to bind Satan, and keep him locked up. I can see the Lord and his angelic host riding on the clouds of majesty. So, is that a yes or a no? A yes or no to what? Me being the director of this little Bible movie. You know, my daddy used to say the Lord works in mysterious ways His wonders to perform. You might call it a coincidence. But I have seen the hand of God and that's enough for me. So yeah, we're gonna make a movie, son. Yeah it's just too weird, man. It's too Christian. And no, your research on Alabama did not help at all. Did not help at all. There's no banjos, no football, no beautiful women... Well there was one maybe. There's no script, no crew, Nothin'. Haven't seen anything. Nothin' except this deal my Aunt Judy and this preacher character cooked up. So, save my seat at the bar. I'll be back for Juneteenth. NOAH: So he says to himself, "Self, I know what I'll do. I'll go home and ask my daddy to take me back." And that's just what he did. But his daddy saw him coming and ran out to meet him. Then you know what he did? He gave his son a big ol' hug of fellowship. The son started giving his little speech. But, the Father said, "Hurry! Bring blue jeans and a hoodie for him, and the best designer sneakers for his feet. Call Sammy's Pizza Palace, reserve the back room "because my baby boy is back, Jack." Can I get an Amen? CONGREGATION: Amen! Praise the Lord! Now, you all go back and sit with your mommies and daddies, ok? Precious little children. [Applause] Oh, I love that story.

Brother Bob, I don't have any easy feelin' about this movie thing. The young man brings a little too much diversity, I think is the new word. A Jewish kid directin' a Christian movie. It ain't right. It's confusin'. See we just don't want YOU to get confused about what's right. See now, the Jewish lady may have given the land, but it still doesn't feel right that you're using your daddy's money on this movie.

Brother Bob, let's talk script. Okay. What'dya got? Umm... Oh, tell him about your story, honey. The one you were talkin' to me about. Ummm... Ok well, you know, I was thinkin' maybe it should be a story of salvation, right? You know we start with sin, but not too much and, you know, not too graphic. Then of course the sinner repents and comes to saving knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. Okay. Uhh... That's not exactly a story. It's more like a sermon. Kinda like the sermon this mornin'. Well, Josh, I mean, the Bible is full of stories. What about the parting of the Red Sea? Been done. I was thinkin' somethin' New Testament. Gospel-like. Sermon on the Mount. Greatest sermon ever preached. You know I was thinking something a little bit more lighthearted like the Battle of Armageddon? That's funny. Hey, what about all those stories your homeboy Jesus used to lay down to his disciples. What were those called? Parables, of course. Yes, he did tell a lot of parables. That's for sure. The Parable of the Prodigal Son is one. Oh! Like in church this mornin'. That was so good. You were amazin' in that. Yeah, well, you know. Pure, unfiltered, high-test Grace of God, for sure. That's a wonderful idea, honey. It's not a bad start. What if we put it in a contemporary setting? An urban comedy, perhaps. Manhattan. I'm partial to that, of course.

Or vice-versa, it doesn't matter. But, I'm not a writer. Pow! I'm a director. Writing's not my specialty. Oh well you could do it, honey. You're always writin' those cute little skits for the young people to do in church. Oh, Josh. He is a good actor, too. Triple threat! You were in all the high school plays! Maybe I just need somethin' to get my creative juices flowin', ya know? Yeah. Maybe we do a competition. A little, among the Sunday school members. I mean they're good at acting out skits. Let them present some ideas, and have a competition, and we could judge, right? We could pick one. Whatd'ya think? I like it. So, ah, you sure you're ok to drive? No all the sugar in that tea made me jittery. Yeah, y'know, with all the intense brainstorming you might need to lay down for a few minutes. You're right that was pretty intense. What I need though, is a 90-page script. Oh, I think you're gonna need a lot more than that with my daddy involved. Is that right? Yeah. I mean I could tell you but... I don't think you'd believe me. Well, maybe I could believe you if you could tell me where I can get a decent burger in this town. Oh, that would definitely be Connie's. Yeah? Hey, Connie's sounds cool to me.

And some of these people here look like they're at the wrong movie. Okay, everybody. Let's get this goin'. Last looks. Actually, let's get you back over there. We're gonna go left to right. [cell phone rings] Turn off your phones. Roll cam. Speed! Here's where you slate it. Jump in there. Scene one, take one. And, action. Peter, Adam... I've decided to retire. I'm handing the company over to you boys. I've worked my whole life building up the business, and now I'm giving it all to you. Thank you, Father. We will make you proud. Not so fast, Peter. Father. I've got to be free. I've got to do it MY way. What do you mean? Let's just sell it. WHAT?! I will take my share and go off to distant lands. I will make a name for myself. NO! YES! NO! WE CAN DO IT TOGETHER! NOOOOOO! YESSSSS! Nooooooo! Sit down Mama! (crying) Noooooo! Mother! Mother! No! It's ok! It's ok! Mother! No! My muscles. Noooooooooooo! Breathe! Breathe! CUT! Fantastic. Is she ok? That was so great, wow! Great commitment. I loved it. We're gonna bring it back... a touch. And a... and let's go again. Yeah? Alright, so uhh... roll it back! So then Geoffrey, and the lady playin' the mother, get into it about this cross she's supposed to wear in the scene. Ya know he puts one on her with this Jesus on it, and she's like, "I'm not wearing this because it's way too Catholic." By the way, if I had on some gym shorts right now it'd be ON. Oh yeah? Oh yeah. You think you could take me? Oh... that's pathetic. About what I would expect. Hey. I'm an artist. Not a jock, ok? Besides, golf's my game. I've been wondering about your game, lately. Wonderin' about my game, huh? That's cute, ok. You know what I've been wonderin' about? This reggae fixation that Bob has? What's up with that? Grandaddy has this great Jamaican housekeeper, Pammy. Practically daddy's second mother. Ya know he jammed with a bunch of rasta guys once. No way. Yeah. Right out of high school he moved up to Clearwater Beach. Yeah out of Big Bob's reach. Tryin' to... You know, you know. Ya know he still has some chops though underneath that uptight Baptist preacher skin. But, I'm not supposed to let that cat out of the bag. Meow. What else is in the bag? Bob and Noah's parents sign a secret marriage contract for the two of you? Oh. Gross. Hey I've been seein' the way he creeps around you. Psh. Hey you two would make a really cute couple, if you can handle it, ya know. Oh, yeah? Yeah. Yeah. Ya know, you'd make a fine little pack of fundamentalists together. Ya know, get a big white house. Keep the Baptists populated. God knows, they don't have enough of those in Alabama. You know what? I think that Noah threatens you. No. Not even close. That's cute. Maybe there's a movie in there somewhere, ya know? One big man on campus facing off against another in an epic battle for the... For the what? Oh! Ok! I am so sorry about that. That was just a little uhh... Coach says never let the opponent get in your head. So, uhh, this really is your first time out of the big city, huh? Yeah. Mama's apron strings pretty short? Wouldn't know. After she and my dad split up she took a job in London. Text and talk every now and then. It's ok. So, what about your daddy then? Last I heard, Canada. So... no family around? I got my buddy Garth. He's my brother, y'know? And my Aunt Judy. She's been tryin' to get me to visit for a long time. I'm glad it worked out because I like Alabama. Wait so she lives here? Yeah. Oh, you don't even know, do you? Your dad and my Aunt Judy, the wealthy timber baroness, are the executive producers of this little Bible movie we're supposed to be shooting. Uhhh... I dunno if I was supposed to tell you that, so let's keep that a secret, yeah? Well, I can keep a secret. Ohhh. Still chuckle about this, myself. "Eternal Spring!" New York agency says it makes it more appealing to the snooty Yankees - - no offense. But between you and me, cow dung is cow dung. Hey albeit, New York ad agency, that's pretty big time, J.J.. Yeah, well I'm just a... little old small time farmer and business man tryin' to expand the market. With four thousand acres of prime south Alabama farm land. I was calling it "Pure Manure". Lyrical, don't you think? Pure Manure. They said it wasn't sexy enough. Said I need to go right straight to the results, not talk about product. So there you have it, "Eternal Spring." Very zen-like. I love it. I dunno. Sounds a bit pretentious for a bag of cow dung. J.J. and I were talking about some marketing possibilities in your film with his... Product. Right. What I know about making movies wouldn't even fill a shot glass. But Judith here assures me that this... Product placement. Yeah that. That it would be good for our little enterprise. So with your permission, I wrote this to get the ball rolling. Welcome to the movie business! ♪ Outta bacon cheeseburgers, bro. I dunno how you can eat that mess anyway. So look, a Jew, a brother, and a Baptist preacher walk into a bar... Josh, need you back here, please. Be right there. Hold the punchline. We gotta get this thing going. There's my beautiful sister in Christ. Hug of fellowship! Noah... Where's Josh? He's around back, I think. Oh, you know what? How 'bout I go get him for you. You stay right here, ok? Thanks. Be right back. I got him. Is he working for this? Can I have a word? Sorry. Hair looks great. Thanks. Hey so Josh is really nervous about this next scene and doesn't want any extra people that don't need to be here to be here, so can you head over to Emily and break it to her gently? She'll take it better from you. Sure! Hi, Em! Uhh... I'm supposed to tell you that Josh like umm, doesn't want you here? He thinks you should like... leave. Really? Sorry. Roll cam... And... SPEED! The Prodigal. Scene 40. Take 1. Action! And this wiseguy, he ends up sayin' right to the waiter, "Hey yo! This is not an eight-ounce New York Strip." So he sends it right back, sends it right back to the kitchen. My dad, he takes this strip, he puts it on a different plate, flips it over, trims it a bit, throws some go-juice on there and sends it right back out. Now this guy, he takes one look at it. You wanna know what he says? Shh. C'mon, c'mon, c'mon. "Now THAT'S a New York strip!" [laughter] Hey, yo bartender. We need drinks all around, alright. And you know what? You put that baby on my tab! ADAM! ADAM! ADAM! ADAM! Whoo! Yeah baby! That's what I'm talkin' about! That's what I'm talkin' about. Everybody, YES! Thank you! Can we get a playback on that? Well, the board didn't want us to rent this place. And the women's missionary circle's all up in arms because they thought we were usin' church money to buy beer. I told them it was just apple juice. Then they didn't like the girls' costumes. But it says in Luke 15:30, "he squandered his property with prostitutes!" He says it right here so BOOM! There ya go, what're you gonna do about that? Amen? Amen. Well, what did you think, Brother Bob? Hey, Emily. It's Josh, again. Just gimme a shout. So J, I was thinkin' man, if we take scenes 14 and 22, and pick it up at... let's say 12, man, we should be able to zoom right through to the end of 13 and at least get back a half a day. What do you think about that? Yeah... Hot set. Fly that out. Bob Cross. Humble servant of the Lord. Right. I'm from the Montgomery paper we talked on the phone. Oh, yes, yes. Praise the Lord, I'm so glad you're here. We're about to shoot a scene. Amazing work with the casting. They look so real, honestly. Just like real homeless people. What do you real homeless people look like? Point taken. The fact is these are our friends. We see them every week, on Saturday we feed them lunch in the park, and then on Wednesday they're here for clothes closet. Some of them actually heard about the movie, and bless their hearts, they're just here to help us out. Looks great. Ok everybody, places. Hey, Guy. It's been a long time. Geoffrey... Quiet. Roll cam. And speed. The Prodigal scene 58 take 1. Settling. Action. Back up. No. You're in my spot, sweetheart. This is NOT your spot. You heard the lady, pal. BACK OF THE LINE! END OF THE LINE! Back out of this. Get your claws off me! Hey you know what? I'm not gonna tell you twice. You touch my hat again, You think you're somethin' special? I'm gonna... CUT! Wow. Intense. It's ok. It's in the script. Josh told him to do that. Josh? Your director? Tell me about him. Josh? Well, God really blessed our socks off by sending him our way. We prayed that God would pour his Spirit into this production and well, prepare the hearts of the sinners who might see this movie. Our prayer warriors are on their knees day and night, interceding for people to come to the saving knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ so that they might give their hearts to Him. Man, you think he really believes that stuff? How's the money holdin' out on the movie, Guy? Well, was fixin' to run out. I don't know how he did it, but that boy somehow managed to squeeze this outta ol' J.J. Barnes. Look at that. The manure tycoon? Yep. Huh. Cow manure in a Christian movie. Wouldn't be the first time... It'd be more accurate if it was pig manure. Can you imagine what Brother Big Bob would say about all this? [Angelic swell] Well, there you are, Pastor! Mrs. Wiley called. She want's you to visit her sister at the hospital. Guy said to tell you she's one of our biggest tithers. She had her gall bladder out! And they took out both of her lungs. They ripped her vertabrae off her backbone. And now she just sits there like a Jello salad. [Bell ring] For Pete's sake! Get a cell phone! Geoffrey! Oh. It's you. You seen Emily? Child, you are wastin' my time and hers. Whoa, easy. What's the deal? The deal? The deal is you kickin' her off your set. What? No, I would never do that. I'm confused. Child get in line. She's a 20-year old PK with ants in her pants like she wants to dance. PK? Lordy, where do you come from? A preacher's kid. A confused one. She thinks she's in love with this cute boy that just swooped into town like Harold Hill promising gold trombones, but only breakin' people's hearts. Harold Hill? Really? Google it. Josh I love that girl. And you need to make this right. Or else you're gonna have me to deal with. And I know you don't want that. [DOOR BELL] Excuse me. Here we are at the end of the second act and the prodigal son has wasted all his inheritence, he been beaten up, he's homeless, he's thinkin' about home, naturally, I would be too. But he also remembers what he did to his dad. He betrayed him. He abandoned him. Then again, he's very desperate. So, he decides to go home anyway and beg his dad to take him back in. And... That's a metaphor. For when you hit rock bottom and your world's just crumbling all around you. And, you start thinking, maybe you can see things differently than you've ever seen them before. What am I tryin' to say here? You know what? I... I'm starting to think that it's just as much about the father as it is about the son. The love of a father is just total embrace. There's no boundries. And if you don't have a physical one then maybe a heavenly type. [Table Crash] [Goat BLEET] CHILD! All I wanted was two more sand tarts. Now look at this mess. Come on, Gracie. It's time for your nap. [Goat BLEET] Geoffrey said he needed me on set, so... I'm glad you're here. Listen, this thing... there's been some kind of misunderstanding. I don't know who or what or why. You're finishing up soon, you're heading out. I'll be leaving too. It's... It's fine. Let's hang out, ya know? After we wrap tonight? Hey, look at y'all two. Y'all are so cute. But we gotta go, come on man. We're losing light. Connie's? Bacon cheeseburgers? Let's roll. Hold that. And speed. The prodigal scene 64 take 1. And wait... Action. Man, there you go. I've been lookin' all over for you. What's happenin' bro. Look me in my eye. And tell me I'm the man. You're the man. Don't you forget it. We're on our way outta here. Hey, Maoz. He's right here. Man, look. He's got something to tell you. Yo, David. What's goin' on, man? Yo, are you ready to play with the big dogs? Yeah. What're you talkin' 'bout? Green light is on, And I got you a job. Second unit director! Whoa! Awesome! That's crazy! Ain't no crazier than you and me doin' this, right? Praise the Lord. Listen, we're so close to wrapping though. Look, I know. I'm sorry. I need you and Garth in L.A, man. Hey, look. Say no more. It'll take us what, about two days to make the drive. We're there. Don't worry 'bout it. Hey, David. Let me talk to you... I'll call you tonight or somethin' man. Hey, Josh. How ya doin'? Good. Good. Good. Have you looked at the footage? Any good keepers? Yeah lotsa keepers and it gets even better as we go along. Great. Momentum. Love it. I just want to tell you, you've done a great job. I'm very impressed by you. Your Aunt Judith'd be very proud. Thanks. That means a lot. Listen, Brother Bob, at some point I'd like to talk to you, some thing... There you are! The board wants to meet with you. Can't believe you're bailing on me, man. Blume, this is our shot. Dude, if we don't take advantage of an opportunity like this it may not come back around. You know that. Look, man. Gimme a call and let me know what you decide, alright? [Motorcycle engine] Man, you think he really believes that stuff? Brother Bob, always sellin'. Not sure anybody's buyin'. Amen. Praise the Lord. Then he said, "We already bound Satan." "Praise the Lord." Maybe we can bind the accountant, too. But wait a minute, maybe they're all in the same. I think they've got the general idea, Noah. Noah... I'm disappointed. I know. It's disappointing. There were certain other people you could have recorded. Seems like you and certain other people have been engaging with some folks that, uhh... ...that have a background and a lifestyle contrary to what we... Look, Pastor. We've been here from the beginning. Paying our tithes, keeping this church goin'. Now these... these outsiders come in and all of a sudden they're the center of your universe. Where were they when the roof needed repairing and the money was short? We had to make sacrifices just to keep our doors open. How 'bout the Muslim? Which Muslim? There's more than one?! There's Ahmad. And there's Frank, the sound guy. And I think there's a few Episcopalians. And a Catholic, or two. Really wasn't keeping a running tab. And I think I saw a Presbyterian. I'm not even sure Javier has his green card! Pastor, we appreciate your outreach efforts. But we're afraid your focus has shifted AWAY from a pastor's priorities. What about Geoffrey Jordan? Geoffrey. Ya know, I think God loves him as much as he loves you and me. Can you imagine what your daddy would say to all of this? Brother Big Bob would not put up... If I have to hear one more time what my daddy would say or do... [Golf club hits ball] So that's the way it is, huh? Yeah, I guess so. Gonna finish tonight's scene and pack up and leave tomorrow. I mean, I didn't plan it this way. Josh, what about Bob and the church people? 95-percent of it's done. 90. Maybe 85. They're gonna be fine. It's just a couple scenes to pick up. They're gonna be fine without me. Josh, I think you're making a mistake. Come on, Aunt Judy. Listen, you've spent seven years tryin' to get your college degree. Look, I understand how difficult it is to find your calling, or whatever you call it. God knows, I've had three husbands and three careers, and I don't know what mine is. Well, mine's filmmaking. I'm pretty sure about that. That's what I love. Josh, that's what you are doing. Right now. Ok you don't have any vampires or superheroes. But I think that what you're doing is worthwhile. Sweetie pie, I didn't SPEND money on your college career. I invested it. In you. I appreciate that. Do you? Running off to the next big thing, grass is always greener. It's in your blood. But if you would just stop. Look at where you are. You are LIVING the dream. With people who love you right where you are. There are two choices as we see it. Shut it down now. Stop throwin' good money after bad. Or... find some believers to finish the job. I'm sure there are a FEW Christians in the movie business. Or what? It's hard to imagine this church without a Cross in the pulpit. Your daddy stood there for forty years. And you been there ever since. But, Brother Bob, we seem to be at a crossroads here. NOAH sings: ♪ O happy day. O happy day... Hey, Em! Just wanna update you on the movie. Looks like things are comin' to a boil. The board is meetin' with your daddy and uhhh gosh. Looks like they're gonna pull the plug. I mean it's a shame. It's a great idea, making a movie, right? It had a ton of potential. Or at least until Josh and his rag-tag mob took over. But look, now everything can at least maybe get back to normal around here. Normal? Great. What is your problem? We had some great times, Emily, in the past. Maybe we can... Look, Noah. It's not gonna happen, ok? I'm moving on. Ok, well, if you're moving on with your boyfriend Josh, you might wanna pack your bags. It took him long enough, but he's sendin' Mr. Hollywood and all his friends on their way. Good riddance if you ask me. You know what though? I'm a forgiving person. I'ma turn the other cheek, ok? You're gonna see the light. Nothing ever changes with you, does it daddy? What? I don't understand. You preach love and acceptance but you don't even know how to love someone who doesn't agree with you. First Geoffrey, then my sister, and now Josh. Well add one more to the list. I'm leaving. I don't understand. No, you don't. And you probably never will. Josh, why haven't you responded to my texts? I've been trying to talk to you. We should talk about that. Carl will you excuse me for a second? This is important. Daddy's trying to pull the plug on the whole thing. Ok, listen. I can explain everything. I should have responded to your texts. However... I've been tryin' to find a way to say that... I'm leaving for L.A. tomorrow morning. The other gig came through and Garth's already left. I gotta get there by the weekend. I'm probably gonna break it to Bob right after we wrap tonight. Wait, so... so this is your decision then. So you're just gonna bail. Onto the next big adventure. Huh? You have no right to lecture me about bailing, ok? What about you? You're gonna finish up JuCo and run off to wherever. Well if you had to deal with a daddy like mine. .. But I didn't, did I? He may not be perfect but he's here. So you should probably give him another chance. Ready when you are, J.B.. Let's do this, Carl. Ahmad, you ok? Yeah I'm just a little lightheaded. I'll be alright. Let's take our places and make sure we got the blocking. Let's do a little rehearsal. I'm gonna have you roll on this though, I wanna check your fancy camerawork on playback. Action! My son. My son. Dad, I'm so sorry. Dad, I know I hurt you and mom but if I could just... It's ok. Amanda, call the neighbors. We're throwing a party. Our son is home. CUT! I really love that intention, it's all there, we just need to really bring the energy up. You know this is the first time you've seen him in, I dunno, over a year, two years. Lemme see that playback. We gotta lotta ground to cover, ok? You've been watching Garth, we gotta keep it movin' tonight. We gotta focus on this. AHMAD! Somebody call 911! Ahmad?! [Hospital equipment beeps] [Clarinet ♪] "Amazing Grace" Saw you in there... praying. Ya know Josh, these days about the only time I know what I'm doin', is when I'm tellin' God I don't know what I'm doin'. Think God will answer your prayer? I don't know. I'm not sure of much of anything right now. C'mon... Where's the old Brother Bob Cross? Maybe the old Brother Bob was an act. Like some mediocre cover band. You recognize the tune, the words sound the same, but it's just not the real thing. The doctor said Ahmad had a heart attack. They put in a stent. There doesn't seem to be any permanent damage. So the prognosis is good. But in light of this, and some other difficulties that have arisen, we need to shut down production. Now I know you all have put your heart and soul into this. But right now, our thoughts and prayers need to be with Ahmad and his family. Looks like folks been to a funeral. Still, it's the most life I've seen around here in twenty years. [Car passing] [Garbled radio voices] RADIO PREACHER: God will not withold his anger and wrath... [Reggae Music] It's like going back to basics. What would Jesus tell us? What did Jesus tell us? Love God. And love one another. The basics. Sometimes it takes an outside influence to help us open up our eyes and see things fresh. We've had quite a bit of outside influence lately. A young fella and some of his friends, some of you were involved because of him. Working and helping us with the movie. Of course you know who I'm talking about. Josh? JOSH??? Sorry to disrupt your sermon, Brother Bob and everyone. But uhh... ya know when I was a kid and I went to temple I'd tip-toe in 'cause I didn't want anybody to know I was there and would you look at me now. Look at you now. Listen, I was on the way to L.A. to help some friends start on a movie but I realized that I have friends here that need me. To finish a movie. Pastor, would you give that boy a microphone so we can hear him? I have a confession to make. I used to think Christians were just a bunch of judgmental hypocrites. And some are, and some aren't. And I wouldn't have known that until I got to know some of you. And Brother Bob. Shooting the Prodigal has been, yes, unorthodox. And it's also been one of the best experiences of my life. Pastor, could you ask him to make a point out of all of this? Ok. When I first landed, I saw this puppet show that Bob was in and he did this character, right and it was amazing. I mean this guy's got some chops, ok? He's a natural actor! So I got to thinkin' that since Ahmad's in the hospital, let's make Bob the FATHER! In the film. Yes it sounds crazy. We'd have to reshoot a couple scenes but it's doable and we could start right away. Right after church. I don't mean to bust any balloons here, but just how do you suppose we're gonna pay for all this reshooting you're talkin' about? How much would it cost, Josh? Well uhh... Maybe five days. About two grand a day once we ramp back up. We don't have that kind of money, Pastor. And besides, you know money's not the only issue here. You're right, Brother Guy. The real issue is us. Some of us, myself included, have spent a lot of time protecting this comfortable little nest of ours. But I gotta tell ya, God's bigger than the boxes we try to put him in. So why don't we stop trying to protect the boxes. Ok. But where are we gonna come up with the money? I'll pay for it! Now Fred, I don't think you know what we're talkin' about. Course I do. You need ten thousand dollars to finish your movie. Well, I've got more than that in my sock drawer at the house. [congregation laughs] I was gonna leave it to Gracie, but she's got plenty already. And, bless her heart, the way she's declining I could out-live her. Thanks, Fred. What do you say, Brother Bob? ALL IN FAVOR, SAY AYE! AYE! ALL OPPOSED? IT'S UNANIMOUS! [applause] [UPBEAT ORGAN MUSIC] That's not on. Do you know how to turn it on? [MOTORCYCLE] What are you doin' here? Am I lookin' at a ghost? Hey man, funny story. I actually got lost on the way to L.A.. No, seriously. I had to come back. I knew you needed to finish this and to be honest, man, I had to finish this, too. And besides man, when we're finished with this Hollywood's gonna be beatin' down our door. That's right my brotha from another motha. Seriously though, you already know. Hey, so what in the world is a Jew, a brother, and a Baptist preacher doin' in a bar? You never told me. Oh yeah, forgot about that. To shoot a movie. Come on, man. Ok, let's make a movie! Yes sir, man. Let's make history. Hey, preach. I need the real thing tonight. No cover band. That's right. Everybody, this is the shot we've been waitin' for. THE MARTINI! Places. Roll cam. The Prodigal scene 82 take 1. Action. Son, what're you doing out here? Come on and join the party. I can't believe you're throwing him a party. Peter, you and Adam are my sons. You can run away from home, or you can run away without ever leaving home. But it doesn't change who you are. You are my sons. And I love you. Adam, your brother, we thought we lost him. He was gone forever. But he's come home. Why don't you come home, too. Let's be a family. [Cell phone rings] Oh, come on man! What? I mean... Ok I caved! I get 73 translations of the Bible on this thing! Can I get an Amen? Amen and CUT! I'm not sure that last part works but we can fix it in post. That's a wrap, people!
