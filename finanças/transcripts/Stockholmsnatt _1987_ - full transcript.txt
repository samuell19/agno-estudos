This is Paolo Roberto, aged 17, from Upplands Vésby. He was one of the ringleaders behind the Kungsan ﬁghts of ‘85. To the police, he was one of the most dangerous youths in Stockholm. He‘s had his nose busted three times. Almost everything you‘ll see happened to Paulo. Paolo and his family play themselves... Hi, I'm Quincy, Paolo's mate. You can tell just by looking at Paolo that he's got the warrior instinct. When you're with him down town you can see he'd never bottle it. Even if he was getting beaten up, he'd never bottle out of a ﬁght. I ﬁrst met him in Kungsan last summer. He was totally into mugging and stuff. It was like he'd built a wall around himself... ...that was impossible to penetrate. THE KING OF KUNGSAN Get out! Hi, Paolo. Problems? Seeya... What's got into you, wop? You're not coming in! Who the fuck do you think you are?! -What's going on? -I got kicked out 'cos of a brawl. -And then Mange came and kicked... -Was it Mange? -He kicked me in the head. -Fuck that arsehole, OK? Come on... Got a light? - Have you? Got a fag? -That was my last. -"Last"? -My last fag. -And? "Blend? Wonderful." What's your game? I want my fag. When I say I want a fag, you give me one. Get it? Cool it. If you want the fag, take it. Just cool it. Don't touch me. I hate people touching me. Relax. You're looking for a bit of aggro, aren't you? Kill the bastard! More! Paolo's being chased! He's a fucking tiger! Never bottles out of a ﬁght. Paolo, Paolo! Over here! -Take my jacket. -Take it easy. Quick. -Cool it. -Turn round. Looks good. Just the thing for a tiger. See ya... Bumped into some fucking punks. -Who the fuck was that? -The Phantom! Quincy. The Odenplan Gang. Real hard arse. -He's quit. Dance, music - new sound. -A great mate too. On your right. There's one! Take it easy, son, and you won't get hurt. Move your hand... -Fucking pigs. -Take it easy, OK? Let's see if the bastard's got a knife... He's clean. -Easy, I said. Easy! -OK. Good. I‘ll just run him through the computer... Yes, your man ‘s got a record, I see. lt‘s Roberto Paolo Antonio, arrested and ﬁngerprinted in ‘86... -Leave it off. -lt's you that should leave it off. You're in a police car, get it? We make the rules. What your boy's doing at nights- -beating up innocent people... It's serious stuff. If this happens again, he'll be put in custody... -...and he'll go to prison. -I see. -I think we can be on our way. -Thank you. Good luck. Have a nice day. -Beating up innocent people? -What's it to you, you bitch? -Don't talk to your mother like that. -l'll talk to her how I want. lwon't have you in my house! You bring shame on the family! This is no way to sort things out. We have to talk about this properly. -Hello, Kaspar. -Hi! How's it going? -Rockin'. -Great. -She's a bit of alright! -Nillan? She's in the ﬁnal year. -She's well tasty! -Forget it. You ain't got a chance. We'll see about that. -Hi. -Hi, Paolo. See you. -How do you know my name? -The whole school knows it. -You're the guy that ﬁghts a lot. -What if I am? I've got a lesson to go to. By the way... It's a shame that you piss around with all that. That you haven't grown out of it. Just check out those side kicks! -What's got into you now? -Must you always watch those ﬁlms? I'll watch what the hell I want to. I don't want you teaching Ian to kick like that. -You're incredible. -Teach him something good instead. -Where are you going? -Out! -l'm coming too. -You're going nowhere. Can't we have any fun in this fucking house? -Quincy! -Hi, how's it hanging? Alright? Rockin'. Brought your jacket. Heard you were here. -Heard you got done yesterday. -That's life. -Have you met the others? -Just got here. It's packed. -See that bird there? Bit of alright, eh? -You kidding? -Who is it? -Her name's Nillan. Something going on? No. I haven't much of a chance there. -Show her what you're good for! -What do you mean? -Just be yourself a bit. -Could cost me... It could be worth it. I promise. -Hi, Paolo! -Hi. Guess who's here. Mange from Capricorn. -Where the fuck is he? -By the stage. Got his whole gang. Fuck! Come on! Drop it, Paolo. Don't let the bastard wind you up. Forget it. Come on, let's go. What's got into you, you idiot! Shit. Paolo drives me mad. As soon as he gets provoked, up comes the wall. He gets crazy. I know what it's like to want to go and tw out a new kick on someone. You don't regret it, 'cos it's a laugh. It gets so it's like a drug. You want more and more. It's shit. I feel sorry for Paolo’s dad. He really tries to talk to Paolo... I can't. I'm seeing my mates. Mates? This is your future. You're staying in tonight. -l'm doing this for your sake. -Get off me. You're letting yourself down. You're staying in! No way. I don't want to see you in prison! Paolo! -Did you see how much cash he had? -Let's take him down, Paolo. -lt's too crowded. -We take him and leg it. Get in the ﬁrst kick. lwon't bottle it. Come on! Just get in the ﬁrst kick and I'll be right behind you! You won't bottle it? OK, let's take him. Hello, little doggy. - Nice dogs those. No! No! Give it to me! The cops! Hi. Hi, Paolo. -What would you like? -The same. I feel great today. Dinner with you, then training... -l've got a present for you. -For me? Thanks! I love presents! What can it be? Thank you so much. -lt's gold. -Of course. -Where did you get it from? -I bought it. -You can't afford this. -I just came across it, so what? You nicked it. You nicked the money to buy it, didn't you. -So? -I get it. This restaurant. Your clothes. And then this. Do you realise how much you upset me? You wanker. Have a nice evening. Come on, you can't chicken out now! Peer-group pressure! Have some, Ian, come OH... A little more... You chickening out? -Paolo, wait for me. -lt's late. Go home. -Paolo! -Come on! ...chill out on a beach. Sunbathing, swimming, drinking... -Well, look who it isn't! -lt's Mini-Paolo outfor a walk! -What shall we do with him, boys? -He's yours. Shouldn't you be in bed? Well? -Got you now. -What are you doing? Stop! He's got be around here somewhere. You're dead, you little rat. -You go ﬁrst? -No, you go ﬁrst. Paolo! Alright. The hard nuts are out playing, I see. Nice work, Mange. Fuck off. Let's go. -Don't tell Paolo. -You're all right. I'll go and get help. Ian! Ian! Stop! Stop! Hi, Paolo. -Quincy! Who was it? -Where the fuck have you been? -Who the fuck was it? -Just someone... ...who thinks a sign of strength is to take down the weak. -l'll kill the bastards. -Good luck. -Hi. -Cheers. How are you doing? Let's have a look... -Nasty. Does it hurt? -A bit, now and then. -l'll get those bastards, Ian. -There were 3 of them. I had no chance. Lucky Quincy turned up. -Is it boring here? -A bit. There's a guy called Arne. We talk and play cards... -Who's that? -A guy some tossers beat up. He's over there... The courtﬁnds Paolo Roberto guilty of robbery and assault. The court therefore sentences him to probation and a ﬁne of £80. Do you think you could forgive me? Just tell me this: why did you keep on kicking me after you'd robbed me? -Hi, Quincy. Alright? -Hi. Tea? -How'd it go? -Awfu|. -Got a ﬁne and probation. -Maybe it's time to give up. Easy for you to say. You've got your music. -All people respect me for is two ﬁsts. -Nillan won't be impressed, believe me! -Cool, Quincy. Me getting your jacket. -No problem. Check this out. Say something into the mike. -Paolo! -OK... Can I have a go? Quincy here... Yes, he's here... I'll tell him. OK... Bye. -That was your dad. -My dad? He wants you home straight away. Sounded like he meant it. Where are we going, Dad? Dad! Where are we going? You'll see. Paolo, read this. I'll be outside. I've had enough of you. What the hell's going on now? -Are you selling the house? -Yes, I'm selling up. Your mum, Ian and l are moving back to Italy. I'll get a job down there. You are not welcome. You have brought shame on the family. I'm sending you to a foster home. Paolo, look at me. I like you. You have another chance. I believe in you. lwant to be proud of you, you know. Think of your grandfather in Italy. -Dad... -Paolo. "You can shuck it and shee!" Paolo, there's that bloke who cut me. Don't! Stop! Go on Paolo, cut him! -Remember Ian. -Go on, Paolo. Kill the bastard. Go on, then! Cut him, Paolo. Don ‘t! Stop! You wanker. Get off me! Good luck. Get it? Go on, Paolo! -What the fuck are you playing at? -Playing at? It's over, get it? -What the fuck are you playing at? -Come on, let's go. -Cool! -Wait 'til Quincy's band comes on! Fuck me, what a crowd! -lt's been tough, but it's OK now. -That's nice. -This is my little brother, Ian. -l'm Nillan. I'll go and check out the disco. I hate being in prison. Do you know how old I was the ﬁrst time? l was 14. Just a 14-year-old. Four white walls and a locked door. It's enough to make anyone depressed. There's been a few court cases since then and some time in custody. That wasn't what I dreamed of doing when I was nine. Paolo... Come on, let's go down. The band's on soon. That was the story of Paolo. To the police he was one of the most dangerous youths in Stockholm. Why did he start ﬁghting? I don ‘t even think he knows himself"
