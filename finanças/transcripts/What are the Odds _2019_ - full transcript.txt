[in Hindi] You must've heard stories that seemed usual. But what about unusual stories? By unusual I meant... I meant... [sighs] Like, finding a betel vendor at a betel store. It's usual. Finding a tailor at a betel store is also a usual thing. But finding the betel vendor and the tailor having an ice cream together at the betel store... Umm... Unusual, isn't it? [chuckles] So this is a tale about a boy and a girl. A tale of their weird friendship and their weird friends. They wouldn't have crossed paths on a normal day. But today... It's quite unusual.

Sir, it's Kirkire. And these are friendship bands, sir. No friendship over here, just Hindi exam paper. But sir, these are awareness bands. I'm spreading awareness, sir. Do your awareness business outside. [huffs] What about our plan? [indistinct chatter] -Don't do it, man. -What? I know what you're thinking about, I'm just saying, it's not a good idea. You don't know what I'm thinking. See, I knew you were gonna say that. What is your problem? You're ditching me anyway. Basically, I stayed up all night. And like the Fibonacci sequence, I've cracked code here to all the plays in the syllabus. We don't have to do that. But we do. We went over this. Don't mess with them. Them? Who is them? They? Our parents? The government? You think the government cares that we know the syllabus inside out? They just want to intimidate you with their vague multiple choices. Because intimidating students is part of a bigger plan? It's part of their propaganda.

What I meant was that I'm sorry for kicking the water cooler that happened to displace the water jug and spill water on you. -Like that. -Got it. [sighing] What are you doing out here? I don't know. What are you doing out here? What is anyone doing anywhere, really? Aren't you supposed to be giving the exam? You're also supposed to be giving the exam. Cheater cock? This is just a temporary glitch. I'll get it fixed. And even if I can't write the exam, there's no reason why you shouldn't.

I think there's so much more to do than learn the same things as 200 other students. Is there a point? I mean, everyone in that exam hall is studying for the same scholarship. Answering the same questions, studying the same textbook... aiming at the same life. I want to be able to survive in the wild world you know, serve coffee, pay my bills. Be independent. Drink. How old are you? Does it matter? -How old are you? -I'm 18. I vote. You actually vote? Does that surprise you? I don't know. I mean, I am not looking forward to it or anything.

She's an air hostess, so it's just granny and me. [in Hindi] Guys, feed me something. When there was no one around I felt like a boat running aground. [in English] Hello, Bunty. You know he can recognize you, right? Goldfish can distinguish between various shapes and sounds. [Bunty in Hindi] Absolutely! [in English] Rasmalai is gold. Samosa is shaped like a triangle. Jalebi is a mess. And I am all in all. Bunty looks sad. When was the last time you fed him? [in Hindi] It's been ages since I ate something. Mom's not here and Vivek Anand is busy dreaming about his protest. Try to change your mind. The world is not as bad as it seems. Now this reminded me of something. [in English] Anyone up for panipuri? Umm... [in English] Ashwin, how long can a goldfish go without eating? Seriously? No, not seriously. [in Hindi] Oh! It looks like a cotton candy! No! It's a mountain of food! Now I am in a good mood! [in English] It's okay, it's okay. He'll eat. That's too much food. No, no. He'll eat. He's hungry. [in Hindi] You're absolutely right, Vivek Anand. After starving and swimming for a week, I didn't have plenty of weight to lose. And after having this meal, I'll take a snooze. Even though there's too much food, I don't think I'll die of overeating. [in English] Bunty, move. Bunty? Bunty? He's fine. [chuckles nervously] [in Hindi] My name is Bunty, and I can eat a lot, a lot... Bunty? -[in English] Bunty, move! -Bunty? Bunty, move! Bunty, move! Bunty, move! -Bunty! -Move, Bunty! Bye, Bunty. Bye, Bunty. [splashes] Are you sure? -[toilet flushes] -No, wait, wait! -No! -I got him, I got him. I got him, I got him. It's Bunty, right? Do you think we should put him back in the bowl? I can tell ma he's sleeping. He does it all the time. Look his eyes are open. Goldfish don't have eyelids. Their eyes are always open. Oh. I just killed Bunty. He was very old. I think he was blind also. He kept banging into the glass. And I know Bunty. He would have wanted this differently. This? This, his last moments? He wasn't a typically sad fish.

I've been playing guitar half my life. Yeah, seven and a half years. Exactly. I'm 40. You're such a boring ageist, Val! Since you're bringing up facts, Val is a girl's name. It's short for Valerie. You're Valmik Burman. And I can't believe you're two-timing me with that stylist who has nothing in common with you except for the convenience of being tall, and so... So tall! By the way... Forty-year-olds date teenagers all the time. Jerry Seinfeld. Elvis Presley. Salman Khan. Salman Khan? Seriously? That's what's wrong with this? [sighs] [groans] [sighs] So, I'll see you tomorrow? I think you need some time out. I don't need time out. Okay, I think I need some time out. -You're breaking up with me? -I'm not-- [sighs] [inhales] Look, I'm not... I'm not breaking up with you. Just need some time out. -[door closes] -I want my tape back! I want my tape back! Bobby! Do a big fat kakku, come here! -Come on! -Come on, Bobby. Do lots of kakku. Lots of Kakku! -What are you doing? -Come on. Come on. Come on, Bobby. -Do kakku. -Come on. -Check if we're done. -[dog poops] [imitates vomiting] Go on, knock. -Ring the bell? -Ring the bell! [bell rings] [door unlocks] [Monica groans] Yes! "Dear ma'am. [chuckles] Pursuing to the instructions from and behalf of my client, Ms. Monica Dogra. I hereby serve you with the following legal notice. You sent for a bouquet with dog excrement to my client." [screams] You know Siberian cranes used to migrate here. Ten years back. -Here. -Yeah. -How do you know? -It's a fact. It's a fact. -Are you making fun of me? -No. What was that? It's my stomach, I'm hungry. No, no, do you hear that? As a kid, I thought I could hear with my nose -and smell with my ears. -Shush. [everyone screaming] Stop! Stop! Too fast for Rimpu. Rimpu! Why are you dressed in a tree? Red tracksuit scares away wild life. Running tree also scares away wildlife. You really scared us, Rimpu. I want my smile back. Sir! Ha!

Because she'll look at an empty fish bowl and think, oh! Bunty's playing hide-and-seek again. Because we're going to replace Bunty with a new Bunty. And she'll never know that the real Bunty died of asphyxiation. What about you? What happens when My Lady finds out about the bike? -[distant crowd cheering] -[Vivek coughs] -Great band. -[continues coughing] [crowd cheering] You guys like mix tapes? [crowd] Yeah!

You think you can walk in here and tell me what to do? -What are you in, school? -Yeah. I'm in school. But you are the one stealing from a school girl. Vivek? Nice song. Big mix tapes. Mix tapes! Great idea. So, you're stalking me as the Free Drinks Bear now? I'm not stalking you. And between you and me, you're the creep. I think you should leave before it turns ugly. Let's go. The only thing that's gonna turn ugly... is your face! Ah! [groans] Guys, come on! [laughter] That's the second time I've been physically assaulted today. I don't even do karate. I'm sorry. [chuckles] That Valmik Burman is your daddy issues? Thanks for standing up for me today. You obviously don't need me to stand up for you. I know. But, thanks. It was your song. I heard it on the tape, but you didn't let me finish it. You're too busy beating me up. Again, I'm sorry about that. But not that sorry also. That tape recorder is... papa's. It's all I have. [male voice] Bear hug! [farts] They all look the same. That doesn't mean they're the same. What we're looking for is a Bunty personality. You'll know once you see him. Hey, look at that. Look at that one! That one? Yeah. The one not doing anything. [in Hindi] Damn it! Will you feed me or will you keep staring at me? -[animal noises] -[indistinct chatter] -[in English] What are you doing? -Do it, do it now. Free them! -Free them. -Okay. Okay. Okay, okay, okay. -[In Hindi] Come on, pigeon! -Puppy! [in English] You have to free everyone. Get out! Come on! Birds, fly! You're free! Fly! Run, bunny! Come on, you can do it! Run! [in Hindi] Pigeon, fly away! [in English] Hi, puppy! You're free! You're free! Ah! Freedom for everyone! -Come on, come on. Fly! -Got them, got them, got them! Ashwin, into the jungle!

[Vivek panting] Why did the chicken cross the... Ah! [people clamoring] [Vivek in Hindi] Here. [people clamoring] They got away. Lock this place down. [in Hindi] We got away. [siren blaring] [hiccups] [snickers] [laughs] -[Ashwin chuckles] -[Vivek laughing] [both laugh] [groans] [in English] What is my hall ticket doing with you? Hall ticket? What is it doing in your pocket? I don't know. You don't know? Ugh! Uh... This is a mistake. I wanted to miss the exam. And I stole my ticket from the bundle and, yours somehow was... You had it? By mistake. How? I grabbed two instead of one. Why didn't you just put it back? I don't know. I saw you fight with Mr. Gopal and I sensed something was wrong. And I realized I had yours, and... And before you know it, I was being chased and drenched in water. You could've just told me. I'm missing the chance to apply for a scholarship. The exam had already begun. Why did you come to the center at all? If you didn't want to give the exam, why bother coming? I wanted to. It was a way of making sure that my protest is real, to put it into motion. That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard. Your protest just cost me six months. Look, I didn't plan any of this. Okay? You lied to me. All this time, I thought we had something honest. We did. We do. I told you about the tape recorder. You know about granny. My granny has Alzheimer's. She thinks it's going to snow in Mumbai. She's been knitting a sweater for 12 years. I haven't told anyone that. Nobody knows that, not even Boo. Stop it. I know people like you. You think you can go around breaking rules because it gives you a sense of existential purpose. You think it's charming, right? No. You don't know people like me. You know why he stole your songs? Yes, because they're good. Because they're incredible! You're talented and gifted and funny and smart, but that doesn't matter. Because you're ungrateful and you don't wanna see the good in the world. Okay! There it is! The high school poster boy standing up for everyone's human rights. I'm as poster boy as you can get. So easy for you to come here and lecture me on my issues. You think I didn't know you before today? Mr. Self-Righteous with his perfect face and booming social reputation. Do you have any issues? No, I don't. I'm just a normal guy who's relatively happy most of the time. You're not that normal also, Achuu. Forget it, you'll never understand. I understand. Don't tell me I don't understand. You wanna seize the day? Go. Go stand up to your mother and tell her what you wanna do. Don't steal your fucking ticket and live life like an escapist. [constable in Hindi] Here you go. Achuu! What happened to your nose? Who did this? -You did this? -No. You did this. -No. -She didn't, let's go. You can stay here. [door bolts] But ma only comes back tomorrow evening. I could call someone. Um... 99... 85... 435555... 55. Who am I calling? -Papa. -Papa. Papa? You lied about your father, too? Why? Why do all of this? Um... What are the odds that a... boy like you would want to hang out with a girl like me? [sniffling] [honking] -[car door slams] -[in Hindi] Who the hell was that? [man 2] What's the matter? -[man 1] Hey can't you see? -[man 2] Can't you see the signal? [man 2] I stopped 'cause I saw it. You are a wuss! [in English] Bike's gone? [honking, indistinct noises] Helmet's also gone? A man named Rimpu stole it? You stole the goldfish? [in Hindi] When there was no one around, I felt like a boat running aground. [chuckles] [in English] Thank you. The perks of being an adult. You get to bail people out of jail. -Looking forward to it. -[scoffs] Sure! Go, get her. Achuu! Yes, I knew you'd come! Freedom! A guy like me, a girl like you. What are the odds? Excellent dialogue. You came. -Yuck! -Yuck? It worked. Look who's here. Bunty! At least someone missed you. [Val in Hindi] Didn't I tell you that the day was unusual? By the way, there's magic in all of us. We just need to find it. Some find magic in their dream of flying. Some find it in their lover's smile. Some find magic in the idea of not living in regret. ♪ It's the way you love me! ♪ ♪ It's the way you hold me! ♪ [Val in Hindi] What I want to convey is... If something strange happens with you someday, let it happen. Who knows it might seem wonderful later! [Val in English] What are the odds?
