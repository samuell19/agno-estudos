Shall I make you play ludo? Instead of talking to her about her behaviour you're asking her to play with you? Listen to me, how many times have I told you not to stay out of home for so long? It's been two days, where were you? I was at my friend's place. Wow. Then why did you do us the favour of coming home, dear daughter? You should have stayed out for another few days. Mom, what's all this? Why are you unnecessarily making a big issue out of it? You are the one who has made an issue not me. Whenever you feel you leave home, whenever you feel you stay out. Listen, this is my life. I will decide what I want to do in my life. And since you have changed your country, now change your thinking too to lead your life. Wow. - Thank, dad. - No need. Hey, listen to me carefully. If you want to live in this house you will have to do it according to my rules. This gallivanting won't be acceptable. I can't live my life according to someone else's rules. Alright? You can live in your house. I am leaving! I will stay at such a place where I won't have to seek someone's permission to breathe. You have left home so many times earlier too. You get tired after a few days then you come back to this very house. I won't come back this time. At least - not for fifteen days. - Is that so? Yes, I really won't return this time! Go on. You don't leave. You'll return only if you leave. Amber, my child. Dad, it is only your love that stops me. Otherwise, I would have proven to mom long ago that I can live without her. Drama queen. But, dad... No, Amber, you misunderstood me. I called you so that you can prove to your mom that you can live without her and away from home for fifteen days. Who will keep a girl like her? Not everyone is like you, okay? There must be someone who will keep me. Do you understand? There must be someone who'll keep me, right? Right, yes, put that thing there. I'll talk to you later. Bye. Where's my coke? Hey, what's the big idea? Are you a little warden or something tidying up my coke? I hadn't finished it. Listen, my brother Gabbar. How many times have I told you not to stand there and eat? Sir is about to come. You'll get both of us into trouble. Go to hell, you jinx. Don't let your brother get the girl. Will you have this candy? Do you want a slap? You are the one who taught her that, didn't you? Don't teach her anything nice like how much your brother loves her. What's going on? Sir, I was checking its size whether I can eat it in two bites or not. But I won't be able to eat it. Get me another one. Where is it? Morning. Sorry, Sir. - Why are you sorry? - Sir, I am confident that I must have made some mistake. Our library is known for it's cleanliness. What is it known for? For cleanliness. Then why don't you keep it clean? This place is so dirty. - Is this your job? - No, Sir. Then call the guy whose job it is to clean. Veeru, don't you know you must keep the library clean? Speak softly. Don't you know you must keep the library clean? Come on, clean the table. Can't you see the dirt? Am I the dirt? Can't you see the dirt on the table? Mary. What is this? What is this? A piece of snack. It must be laying here for at least fourteen to fifteen hours. Diseases like the coronavirus spread because of carelessness. The fungus must be growing on it too, the bacteria must be spreading. We will get an infection from the bacteria. Our family will catch that infection from us because it is contagious. Then the entire city will catch that infection and it will spread to the entire country. And just like that, the whole world will catch that infection. Are you trying to infect the whole world? If we won't care about these things then how will the world be safe? I have saved the world, Sir. Loot at that! Here you go, they are locked in a tight match. Six balls and nine runs. Uncle, you already owe me five pounds and you'll lose another five today. It's not possible. I can't lose today, son. I will definitely win today. Well done, my boys. Hit some shots, some fours and sixes. Come on! Uncle, you'll lose. If you can't hit fours and six then run and score some more. Or are your legs cramped? - Is it? - Wait. Cricket won't give you anything. If you want to stay happy then turn off the TV. If you go there and give this commentary then you might get paid well for it. Bravo! Hit a six on this ball. That was an absolute miss! Uncle, you lost. Give me five pounds. Are you going to win or should I break the TV? Come on, take a shot now. I will have to break it. I have asked you to watch TV only until seven o'clock. And it is two minutes past seven. And the time that you are wasting is another matter. A person can read a good book. Your eyesight is becoming poor too. Mom, you should tell him. He doesn't listen to me. What do you want? Brother, only a couple of balls were left, that's all we wanted to watch. You have been watching TV since the afternoon. What will happen if you don't watch the last few balls? Tell me. Come on. You should concentrate on your studies. My son is right. Education is the only thing that will support you. Right, Son? This match won't give you anything. You must study, son. Take your pounds now. Uncle, even the chameleon doesn't change colours as quickly as you. Cheers. - Uncle, shall I hoot in excitement then? - No. Do not hoot. You may make a softer sound. But the sound should stay at least a metre and a half away from the jailer's room. Uncle, I don't have a metre inside me to measure my hooting. You keep scaring me unnecessarily. Don't be scared, don't be scared. He must have stretched his body by now. He must have lay down on the right side of the bed. He must have fixed the sheet and covered himself with it. When people sleep their sheets become crinkled. But when our jailer sleeps if there is even a single crinkle in the sheet, it gets straightened out. He must have turned off the light now. Tick. Who is this bigger goon than us in this area who's playing such loud music? - Who is it? - Goon and you? Uncle, your BP becomes low in front of Jagteshwar. - Put the drink down. - Why? - Put it down. - Let me drink, Uncle. Call me younger Uncle first. Wow, younger Uncle. It is such great fun to be addressed as younger Uncle. Listen, put sugar in my tea. No problem. Jagteshwar is coming. He will put the finest sugar in your tea. Dad, is this the place to clip your nails? Can't you be a little thoughtful? It's alright, son. We'll construct a separate room for clipping our nails. Don't deviate from the point. Come, let's check your weight. Who should we wait for? Were we expecting someone? No one told me. Uncle, brother is asking you to check your body weight. You know everything but you can't stop taking potshots at everything. Don't talk too much. Otherwise, people will say that Uncle cracked his nephew's skull. Brother has been waiting for you for an hour. Alright, here I am. Did I lose any weight? You have gained one and a half kg since last week. It's just not possible. Oh, yes, I just remembered. Last time when I checked my weight I was wearing just a vest and underwear. I am wearing a trouser now along with a shirt and I even have my wallet in my pocket. Son, that is why the weight might have increased a little. No problem, Uncle. You can change into a vest and underwear now. Brother only needs results. I don't understand one thing. I try so hard, I work so hard and still my weight is not decreasing. What could be the reason? If that is the thing then you could be suffering from Hypothyroid. We'll get all your tests done. You are coming with me today. Which disease did you say? Hypothyroid. Hyper... It's just not possible. Come on. A disease that I can't even pronounce, how can I suffer from it? - Uncle... - Yes? talk to him about me. Why are you worried? I am right here. Talk to him. I am right here with you. Go right ahead. Brother, I wanted to talk to you about something important. Yes, go on. No, it's time to eat now. Yes, tell me now. Brother, I was saying that I should start working full-time now. From when? Brother, if you say yes then I will start from tomorrow itself. Did you wash your hands? Go and wash your hands. Okay, so you can start from tomorrow. Yes, I'll start from tomorrow. Okay, I'll book a ticket for you for the day after tomorrow. - To where, brother? - To India. Why India? You'll start working here illegally from tomorrow, the embassy will deport you the day after. Go there and after that look for a job in some call-centre. - Brother, I am sorry, I made a mistake. - Wipe your hands first. I made a mistake, brother. Forgive me, brother. I won't say such things again. I was manipulated by someone into saying that. Even if I want to go by bus, I have to walk because of Uncle. - Jaggi! - Yes? Take this bag. Do you let me remember anything? You have all driven me crazy. Aunt, one day I'll get tired and get on a bus to Canada I am telling you. Just go to work. He has started acting smart too now. I told you! No loud music! Get out of this place now! But I already paid you the rent. I will call the police right now. I won't go out. You are the one who will go out. This is Birmingham not Bathinda. I just don't care! Just get out of my house now! Listen, child! What happened? Aunty, it's all in front of you. First, I wasn't at fault. On top of that, she suddenly threw me out of the house. Now you tell me where should I go? It's alright, daughter. This English woman is very fussy. I too want to thrash her. Aunty, shall we beat her together? Let it be, child. God will teach her a lesson. Aunt, do you know anyone here who rents their rooms? This is your house too. Come along, you can stay with me. Come on. Come. We don't come to this library to sit. - This library is our passion. - Yes. We must see what we can do to make things better around here. A book by Baba Bulle Shah was right here. I sent him right next to Uncle Chaudhary. I thought that both the elderly men could sit together and chat. You fool, Uncle Chaudhary is fiction and Baba Bulle Shah is poetry. Is that so? Pash and Shiv were both right here. Where are they? Well, look, Pash is on that end and Shiv is on this end. I thought that Pash is a hot-tempered man and Shiva is a calm fellow. What if they end up fighting with each other? Now, please explain to me that these books here, how did you place them? It's so simple. The blue ones are on one side and the pink ones on the other side. - Well done. - Yes. On what basis did you get this job? On the basis of pity, Sir. I won't feel any pity. I need all of them sorted by the evening. - Do you understand? - Yes, Sir. Mary, show me the list of the new books we have. Though the elders are right that it is not easy to go head to head with books yet look, I have done it. And who are you? You can appreciate me as much as you want. Have I stopped you? By the way, I am known in the whole world as Poet Gullu. - Poet Gullu. - Poet Gullu? That's great. I have heard this name so much. Gullu ice cream, Gullu Kulcha. It's amazing. What is your name? My name is Gabbar. Look at God's sense of humour. Your parents have given you such a macho name, Gabbar. How could they know that your behaviour would be like Basanti? Who are you calling Basanti? Brother, it's common sense. There is no one here except you. And before Poet Gullu makes you dance like Basanti, tell me quickly, - where are the Punjabi romantic novel? - I won't tell you. I won't tell you. They are right here. Sundar and Rani's love story. Wow. What do you think? What will I think? The jailer will come, grab the girl's arm and throw her out. Such low thinking. You should think something big. Why the girl? He will throw all of us out. Uncle, I can't understand you. Are you his father or is he yours? Gather some courage. He doesn't have it in him. You are the head of this family. A man should have some courage in him. I have all the courage. Even today if I toss a rock into the pond, it goes up to eight feet. Let that jailer come today. I will tell him who I am. This is what I am talking about. Yes, tell me, what's the matter? You think that just because everyone is scared of you in this house so I'll be scared too? I am the head of this household. Your rules and principles won't be acceptable in this house. You are not the head, you are the master. Oh, you... You have ruined my flow. - Who am I? - Master. - I am the... what was next? - That thing about rules... I am the master of this house. Your rules and principles won't be acceptable here. - Jaggi, turn on the TV. - Yes. I will see who stops you. - Is that alright? - Perfect. Aunt, is dinner ready? - Yes, it's ready. - Okay. I'll freshen up and come. Come this side. I will talk to him today. What happened? Why are you all standing like this? Uncle, speak up. Speak up. Say something. What does he want to say? I wanted to say that... Jaggi, will you behave yourself or not? The TV is on again today. When you have been told once that the TV should be off at seven that is final. Uncle... Jagteshwar is tired of explaining to you but this crazy family doesn't want to understand. Jaggi, when will you become sensible? When he asks you to do something that means that you must follow his instructions. He is the master of this house. - But... - Turn off the TV. You said that the dinner is ready. Let's eat then. Hurry up and eat whatever you want to eat. We are eating in this house for the last time today. Uncle, I am just worried about the fact that I have friends here but where will you go? - Leave me in an old age home. - Okay. Uncle, have your food. Here. Son, this is Amber. She used to live at that English woman's house next door. She took rent from her for ten days and threw her out in two days. The poor girl was crying. I... I brought her home with me. She'll only stay here for a couple of days. Who knows how hard her parents must have worked to send her here? Hello. Oh, my God, such delicious food. How did you like it? Eat first, I will tell you later. You are eating now and you'll tell me later? How does that make any sense? Uncle, food should be enjoyed and eaten. You are eating as if you have tasted it for the first time. Like just keep eating whatever it is. Right? One mustn't talk while eating. It is considered bad in certain places. Aunt, I talk while eating. I'll go to my room and eat. It's too spicy. Give me some snacks too. By the way, Uncle, there is something. The Jailer didn't say anything to the girl. There is usually a silence before the storm. This time our jailer will do something huge. I think he may get us arrested by the police. Come on, Uncle, don't scare me by saying such things. Uncle, that song from yesterday is playing again. The music is louder than last night too. "We will dance today and scare all the ghosts away." "We won't stop till we have danced our heart away." "I can woo any girl." "People will watch when I dance." "Watch how we do bhangra today." "All your discos will bow down to us." "Watch how we do bhangra today." "All your discos will bow down to us." "He has such killer eyes." "Watch how the Jatt dances and wins the game." "Wins the game." - This song? - Is it your favourite too? "He has such killer eyes. Watch how the Jatt..." No. Music is not allowed in this house after nine pm. But I couldn't sleep. Everyone else is sleepy. If you want to stay in this house then there are certain rules that everyone needs to follow. So much noise in the middle of the night does not seem appropriate in this house at all. Coming to a girl's room, in the middle of the night is that appropriate for this house? I think that you were just looking for an excuse. There's nothing like that. I... knocked. I had no intention of coming to your room. You are unneseccarily doubting my character. Doubting your character? "La la la la doubting your character." "La la la la doubting your character." Oh! - Jaggi. - Yes, brother? Explain our house rules to the guest. Alright. Right now. Rule number one, breakfast is at eight am sharp every morning, without any noise. Rule number two, lights out at ten in the night. Good night, sweet dreams. And you should start dreaming as soon as you fall asleep. Rule number three, forget fried food and desserts. No TV, no unnecessary games. Only aim. Special note, it is possible that brother Jagteshwar may be lenient about these rules but we are very strict about following them. The last and the most important rule, these rules will only last as long as the jailer is at home. Jailer is gone? It's all fun and games! He is a very boring man. Not just boring but also distasteful. He neither eats anything delicious nor lets us. Uncle, if you take taste out of life that is a disrespect to the tongue, right? - Yes. - Absolutely. Come on, I will make delicious things and feed you today. - Wow. - Let's go. Surprise! I am the one who is going to surprise you one day by marrying someone else. Honey, if you marry someone else then how will I become permanent here? What the hell? - You are marrying me for residency? - What else? I wooed you so that I could become a permanent resident here. But... cut my heart and see how much I love you. If you love me so much then why don't you talk to your family about me? Honey, do you know how strict my brother is? My brother is very strict too. No, no, mine is really very strict. But it's alright. I'll talk to him. If I don't get a yes or no answer from you tomorrow then watch. - Tomorrow right? - Yes. So there's no problem today. "The broken basket is of no use to anyone." "Let's start Antakshari in God's name." - Say, Ram, Ram, Ram! - Say, Ram, Ram, Ram! Oh, you put me on the spot. - Come on, sing it. - Come on. Start with M. With M... "Mr Principal, please don't delete..." "My Ranjha's name from your college." - Sing from N. - Start with N. - What should I sing? - Sing anything. "No, no, no, don't tease me." "For God's sake don't block my way." "God forbid if something bad happens." - Oh, my lover... - Oh! Aunt, you have turned out to be very romantic. I think you must have seen many movies when you were young. Hardly, my child. He showed me one movie at Lohri. The revenge of the Jatti. At least I showed you one. Your friends hadn't even see that. Sir, Sir, Sir. Give us a little bit of your precious time. - Please, sit. - Sit, Son, sit. So where were we? Yes, sing. - We were at N. - Go ahead and sing then. - Sing from N. - But N is empty. It's not empty. I'll slap you hard across your face. Sing from N. I don't know any songs from N. I'll start with R then. Alright, sing a song that starts with R then. Alright, sing something from R then. "Have courage, sweety." "Have courage." "You lover will teach each one a lesson." "Have courage, sweety." "You lover will teach each one a lesson." Wow, maestro. By the way, it is better for you if you concentrate on your books rather than girls. You can't remember your syllabus but you remember all the songs. And what's this? So much mess. Stay hygienic. Why are you inviting diseases... You must eat cautiously, right? No system of sitting or eating... Who knows what courage they are talking about? I think he will give me a tough time now. You mustn't feel so scared. He forgot his diary here. - Amber, no! - Amber, I am telling you don't touch it. If my lover is happy then God is happy. - Wow. - I am an infidel. She is a pilgrim. - If my lover is happy? - then God is happy. - The vessels are delicate. - Okay. - But the promises are strong. - Wow! So many people have grazed animals in love. - Wow... - Stop it! What's all this, mom? How many times have I told you? Yet you bring such people home. You give people an inch and they take a mile. This is our house not a lodge. This is called a personal diary! You mustn't read it. But no one taught you that, right? This house runs on principles. We follow a system here to live our lives. And there is no place here for unprincipled people like you. You may stay here tonight but make some other arrangements for yourself tomorrow. But... - Amber! - Amber! Jagteshwar, don't you think that you were a bit too harsh towards the girl? What was her fault? She was just reading out your songs to us not to anyone else. The girl hasn't come out of her room. I went to ask her to get some breakfast. She is packing her things. She made our home so lively. You broke her heart, Son. He is unbelievable. Hello. Yes, Amber? Dad, I am coming. But we will lose our bet against your mom. Dad, bets and all these things mean nothing, okay? And one's own home is one's own. But, Amber, your mom... Talk to Mom. Tell her not to abuse me. - That is difficult but... - Please. Fine, I'll talk to her. - Okay, bye. - Bye. Bye. Alright then, Aunt and Uncle, I am leaving. Don't go anywhere, Amber. You must understand. Aunt, I neither want to understand nor make anyone else understand. Every person has their own style. Isn't that right? And I cannot listen to all these things. If I had to listen to all this wouldn't I have stayed at my own home? And your son said a little too much. I too really wanted to say a lot of things. But I have a special bond with you. That is why I was silent. - Alright then. - Amber, do you know our son has apologized to someone for the very first time? - Apology? - Yes. He didn't even meet me before leaving. - Come with me. - Where? - Come with me. Come. - Why? Oh, so he has done this. That means there is something special about this girl. Well then, Aunt, if I can make your son apologize then I can make him do a lot of other things. The plan to leave is cancelled. Hey, dad. Amber, I have spoken to your mom. She will not abuse you. And she has understood that all these bets and things mean nothing. Of course, they mean something. Bets are important, dad. Alright? And tell mom that I won't enter her house before fifteen days. Amber, I have pleaded to her. One's own house is always own. Come back. There is nothing like that. All homes are our own, okay? Okay then. Bye. I am stuck now, aren't I? Please, don't go. Please, don't leave me and go. Oh, I won't go then. Why are you getting so emotional? I am not emotional because of you. Then? I have understood half the story. She's not answering your phone, right? Isn't that right? Now explain the rest of the story to me. What rest of the story? That why isn't she answering your phone. I don't know. I am already so worried. Listen, don't act too smart. If you tell me then I'll give you a great solution. What happened? She asked me to talk to my brother about our marriage. I am scared of him. He doesn't even let me work overtime. He will definitely let me become a groom. I don't understand your brother at all. Why has he scared everyone around him so much? Come. Let's go and meet your girlfriend. Come. Shall we go on this bike? No, no, we can't go on that. This is Jagteshwar's. He neither rides it himself nor let's anyone else touch it. Is that so? Give me your girlfriend's number. We'll go and meet her. - Come on! - Six, two... Everything is in your hands now. Just pacify my girlfriend this once then I won't let her leave. Jaggi, why do you worry so much? Just let her come. You'll see how she follows you around. - She has come. - She is here? - Hi. - Hi. - Hi, I am Amber. - Hi. I called you. - Yes, please, sit. - Thank you. Actually, I wanted to talk to you about something. This Jaggi is marrying me and I am marrying him. Actually, we are both getting married to each other. You are invited. Please, come. Oh, my God! - You are getting married? - No! - You are a cheat! - No! You said that your brother won't agree. - How did he agree for this cat? - Cat? Amber, tell her the truth. Or will you tell her when she gets me arrested by the police? Sorry, sorry. I am joking, I am joking. Sorry. Okay, I am sorry. I... I wanted to say that please, don't stop talking to Jaggi. He loves you a lot. I will die without you. May I speak? Look, we will convince his brother. Just talk to your family. That's it. - Is that alright? - In case... your family doesn't agree. Call me. We will get you out of there. - Really? - Come on, hug each other now. Why are you hugging her like you are hungry? Do it with love. Hug each other with love. Like Kumar Sanu. Mary, why don't you understand my emotions? I don't even know English. How should I explain it to you? I don't know who said that there is no language of love. You don't even understand my language. I am sorry, Gabbar. I don't understand. Honey, don't say sorry. I want to get married to you. You know... you and I... going in circles. - I love you, Mary. - I love you too. Oh, my God. I don't mean it like that. I am telling you that I love you in a different way. I am getting attracted to you. I want to get married to you. Gabbar! Don't you have the decency to behave with your colleague? Don't let me see you standing here after today. Amber... listen to me. We should go back. You never know, what if he starts beating me right here? Jaggi, why do you lose hope? I am telling you, right? Didn't you see your brother apologize to me today? Watch how he gets scared of me. - Listen to me, you'll get me killed. - Wait. Hello, Jagteshwar. I wanted to talk to you about something. - Tell me. - It's personal. Shall we go out and talk? Yes, someone needs to go out. But not me. Rather both of you. Because I don't waste library's time by going out. Alright. We won't go out. Let's talk right here. Hey, Sundar, when Rani is smiling at you then talk to her. Why are you standing there like that? Sundar, you won't get such a chance again. Understand this! Mr Gullu, you are disturbing the discipline of the library. You have already done it twice. But if you speak loudly again then I will be forced to send you out of the library. And I don't like people who are indisciplined. Right? Is that all? Are you happy? Amber, listen to me. We might lose everything while trying to do something. Jaggi, your brother is weird. It's alright. Watch, he will come around. - Just watch. - Come. May I come in? Did you write sorry outside my room? Yes... I did. But I haven't forgiven you. What does that mean? That means if your worker makes a mistake then he is punished. And if you make a mistake then you should be forgiven just because you apologized. You were at fault too. But still, if you want to punish me then you can do it. I will, I definitely will. Why won't I? But... at the right time. I can't think of anything right now. Tell me something. You always sleep on the right side of the bed, right? Yes. How do you know? It was a guess. It turned out to be right. By the way, you keep your room really organised, isn't it? I don't like mess at all. But mess is also a kind of a design, is it not? Go ahead, read it. Sorry, I disturbed you. By the way, may I say something? You write really well. Carry on. - You will be a star in the future. - Thank you, thank you. Okay, bye. But I haven't forgiven you. I wanted to say good night. Good night. Good night. Left, right, left, right. Left, right. He has come. Come on. Left, right, left, right. He is coming... Left, right, left. He isn't looking. Come on, let's run. - Come on. - Come. Excuse me. Sir, may I run with you? No, actually, I am still warming up. Jaggi, I am gone. There is a file... under my pillow. I had bought some property and kept it a secret from you all. Take care of it after I am gone. Nothing will happen, Uncle. Be strong. Run. Just attend my wedding anyhow. After that... What do you mean after that? But I like that you came here to exercise with my family. - Good. - With your family? I didn't come with your family. Your family came with me. And may I tell you something? They all lie to you. They don't get out of the house, they don't move. Why are you getting angry? They have come today, haven't they? Don't worry. Slowly, I will make everyone fit. Just watch. Look at them, getting fit. - Is this a new version of the Ludo? - Yes. - I think that is why I am losing. - Is that so? Aunt, you are beating Uncle at this. I suggest you kill him, cut him, bleed him. Don't you have manners to speak properly? - What did I say? - What's all this? - Kill him, cut him, bleed him? - I am talking about the dice. Then say that bleed the dice. - What do you mean bleed Uncle? - Look at him making excuses. Uncle, it's your turn. Can you make a little less noise? - Someone is sitting and reading here. - We're dead. Come, you should also sit with the family sometimes. Have some fun and enjoy with us. No, actually, I must leave in some time. Anyway my thinking doesn't match yours. Neither your talk is healthy nor your jokes. I have to go see my friend to spend a good time. And to talk about healthy things. We'll come along too. We will also get to learn healthy things. Come. Amber... You are fine at home. You don't know, naive girl, where you are headed. - Jaggi is saying he wants to go too. - When did I say that? Alright then. I need you in the car in exact seven minutes. Actually, to live a good life, the foremost rule is balance which we have been taught by nature. But we have become so ungrateful that we don't thank nature. Jagteshwar, my friend... - have you read that book? - Which one? Wait, I'll show it to you. Look. Listen to the healthy talk now. You were dying to come here. How could I know that they will bore us so much? They are not laughing. - Jagteshwar, - Yes. I just remembered something funny. Jaggi, something funny! There was a very close friend of Newton's. Like Jagteshwar and I are close friends. One day his friend asked him how did he discover gravity? Do you know what he said? By watching the apple fall. These are healthy jokes. Was that a joke? Jaggi, go to sleep, brother. We are struck. Son, - will you have some tea? - Yes, we will, Sir. Then do one thing, go into the kitchen, make some tea and bring it. Me? - Uncle, we don't know how to make tea. - You don't? Yes, sorry. Okay, let me make some organic tea for you today. - Yes, you read this book in the meantime. - Of course. - Uncle, do you have cream biscuits? - Yes. Come on, let's go! I am reading this book right now. I understand that reading this book is very important. But whatever is written in this book will stay the same, won't it? You can read it tomorrow. But what is here today will not be there tomorrow. Come with us. You will gather the experience like reading a new book. And a book is someone's experience too, is it not? By the way, according to principles, we came with you so you should come with us now. But if you are an unprincipled man then that's another matter. Mr Lashkar Singh, - don't make tea for us. - Alright then. As it is there was no milk at home. Let's go. "Fill the colours in your eyes." "Walk along with me all your life." "Even if it is windy." I am having so much fun. Where are we going, by the way? Because it's almost time for me to eat. - I suggest we go home. - I will take you to the best place. Just come with me. Will I find something to eat at your best place? You will get everything. Just come once. You yourself will say what an amazing place. "Your beautiful eyes give signals." "You are brave like Hitler." "Your beautiful eyes give signals." "You are brave like Hitler." "I feel like falling for all beautiful girls." "Your walk and style has won over many." "The young man who tries to be smart." "He will lose the girl." "Your walk and style has won over many." "Your walk..." "Your swag and style. Gives me jitters." "It seems as if flying in the air." "Your swag and style Gives me jitters." "It seems as if flying in the air." "There seems to be gap in age. I got tagged with you." "Those with him address you as sister-in-law." "Seeing your walk and style makes me restless and I am yearning for you" "Your walk and style has won over many." "The young man who tries to be smart." "He will lose the girl." "Your walk and style has won over many." "She went away and moved on After playing with emotions." "She again touched the chord of love." "She went away and moved on after playing with emotions." "She again touched the chord of love." "You look like red rose and your moves make me restless." "The boy has a lot of attitude and is passing comments on you" "Your walk and style has won over many." "The young man who tries to be smart." "He will lose the girl." "Your walk and style has won over many." "Your walk and style has won over many." "The young man who tries to be smart." "He will lose the girl." "Your walk and style has won over many." "Your walk and style has won over many." "The young man who tries to be smart." "He will lose the girl." "Your walk and style has won over many." "Your walk and style has won over many." Hey, who is that? That is Simmi, who almost became my sister-in-law. Jagteshwar bought his bike for her. Is that so? Why are you silent? Talk. Jagteshwar, you still look the same as you did in college. - Really? - Yes. Was he like this earlier too? What do you mean? I mean... young. That's amazing. - Right? - Yes. But, Simmi, I have to tell you something. Jagteshwar misses you a lot. He talks so much about you... Smiling is not enough. You also tell us do you miss him or not? Obviously, she must be missing me. We were together for three years. When you spend that much time with a person their picture gets printed on your subconscious mind. And dreaming about him becomes natural. Simi... are you free tomorrow? Why? Actually, Jagteshwar wants to meet you. When did I say that? Why? Don't you want to meet her? No, I didn't say that either. I am free. She is free. So... I should go now. We'll meet tomorrow. - Yes. - Okay. - See you. Take care. Bye. - Bye. - Bye. - We had so much fun today. Enough, Jagteshwar Singh, you are meeting her tomorrow. Let her go. It's alright. Thank you. What did we eat? What is this? We didn't even eat anything. Did you charge us for talking? When you were dancing, it was my dinner time. I ate. - Really? - Obviously. Is this what you have selected? Yes. Are you going on a date or for a lecture? Are you going to wear this and go? The minute she sees you she'll say, sorry, Professor, I can't be involved with you. I will help you select. These are very boring. Is this all you have? No, actually, I have another closet too. I don't use it. Those clothes are from when I was in college. Oh, really? Why are you making a mess? I will have to spend three minutes to clean that. Sorry. Here you go. She will be fifty percent impressed because of these. Change into them. Are you feeling embarrassed? Sorry, sorry. Change and come down. I am waiting. Alright? Hurry up. By the way, why didn't you wear the clothes that I chose? Or is there a logic behind that too? Absolutely. The clothes that you chose were tight for me. When the body feels tight, the pressure on your brain increases. When the pressure increases on the brain then you can't control your attitude. Especially things like being affectionate towards your lover when you are going on a love date. - Date? - Date. There was a survey done regarding how a man and his lover... Oh, God, please go! - Hey. - Hi. I am so sorry I am late. By the way, it's not a good thing to make someone wait so much. A few minutes here and there are normal. Well, in a few minutes any good reader can read five to seven pages of any good book. Point. Alright, Sir. I'll keep that in mind the next time. Thank you. You are looking really smart. You haven't changed at all. Even your dressing sense is the same. Thank you. But you have become a lot more organized than before. Thanks. Shall we order something to eat? No, actually, it's not time for me to eat yet. Let's drink something. I am really very hungry. May I order something? Yes. Thank you. - Tell me something interesting. - Certainly. We shouldn't drink cold water. If we warm the water and drink it that improves digestion. - What is this? - Healthy talk. Yes... But we have come on a date. Can't you say something romantic? Of course, I can. Excuse me. Can you please clean this? Thank you. Thank you. We were talking about romantic things. What kind of romantic things do you want to hear? Sad romantic? Happy romantic? Or a romance which hasn't happened yet? You know that the knife and fork should not hit the plate so hard while eating, right? This way other people feel embarrassed. It's not good table manners, right? Shall we go? No, it's almost time for me to order my food now. Actually, I... am not feeling comfortable. Shall we leave? Let's go. The speed limit for this road is only forty. Okay. Okay... Can you pull-over, please? - What happened now? - Please, I just... Where are you going? Where are you going? What was that all about? I have requested the Officer. Requested him what? That you jumped a red light back there. Please, write down the car details. Are you... are you my friend or my enemy? I am a very good friend of yours. Get out of my car now! Calm down. I am calm. Now get out of the car. - But I... - Get out! Get out of my car! Well, on principle, you should drop me to the next roundabout because you made a commitment. Get out! Crazy. - Let's get another one. - Yes, ready. Start. How did it go, Sardar? No, it was good. Actually, we had minor ideological differences because of which she didn't even drop me back. Maybe she didn't understand my way of living life. And she was asking me to change it. This girl is too much. Love doesn't mean changing someone. Love means accepting each other no matter how the other person is. Why should we change ourselves for someone? Now we should do something to fix your mood. What happened to me? I am fine. I am absolutely okay. I'm fine. We'll go out for lunch. Let's go. Jaggi, get the car keys. Car? Let's go on the bike. - Jaggi, hurry up. I am going to get it. - No, no, just a minute. I have never let anyone touch it. Wait, I'll see. It's a lovely place, isn't it? The place is nice. Sardar, whether you admit it or not it is way more peaceful here than your room. The only difference is that your room is sort of closed like you. And this place is open like me. Do you know that I come here a lot? I really keep coming here. Don't you believe it? Move aside. Amber. Sardar, have you ever talked to yourself? I talk to myself here away from the rest of the world. These trees, these leaves, they all know me. Wherever I step, the winds become fast. I am a queen when I come here. All the birds know me. Every tree and sapling knows me. When I come here I feel like flying. Did you get hurt? If such a small wound could show me such a wonderful smile of yours then what else do I need? Will you keep laughing now? Do something about it. "The matter is out of our hands now." "My heart is stuck on you now." "The matter is out of our hands now." "My heart is stuck on you now." "The matter is out of our hands now." "My heart is stuck on you now." Are you going to the library? Not in the car. Let's walk there today. "The colour of your dresses has become brighter too." "I too have become absolutely stylish." "My happiness is in your smile." "What they call a heart has started talking today." "What should I tell you? I have become speechless." "Your sweet stare is worth lacs." "The matter is out of our hands now." "My heart is stuck on you now." "The matter is out of our hands now." "My heart is stuck on you now." "These winds become fragrant when they see you." "What if my dreams really come true?" "She is sitting near the moon." "Let me tell you this little sweet thing." "Those who fall in love are innocent." "But this world calls them crazy." "The matter is out of our hands now." "My heart is stuck on you now." "The matter is out of our hands now." "My heart is stuck on you now." This is Birmingham's favourite library only because we take special care to manage things and keep them organized. Organized? What is this? Sir, you are the one who said that we should clean the entire library. I searched every single book but I couldn't find dust anywhere. How long will it take to fix it? Nothing much. Just around two and a half hours. In fifteen minutes the survey team is coming to check the library. Why are you getting stressed? Gabbar. - Gabbar, come with me. - Let's go. Okay, yes, be prepared. They are coming. Sorted. How do you like it? Really? Then do one thing, pick up every single book and put them on the racks. - Sir. - Hello. What should we do now? We can just wait now. Let's see what happens. Okay then. All the best. Very impressive. I like it. - Very impressive. - Thank you. This library has won many awards for tidiness and other things. I think this year, I am going to make a special recommendation. And do you know it might even mean an increase in budget? Thank you, Ma'am. Thank you. - Keep up the good work. - Thank you. I really appreciate it. - Well done. - That is an honour for us. Thank you, thank you. Amber, congratulations. Our library has won... What? Where? What are you looking at? Give him a thrashing. Brother, please, don't hit him. Should I hit you as well? No, you may beat him. - Bravo. - Oh, my God. If their family comes within five minutes then it's fine. Otherwise, take them both, chop them up and bury them in the backyard. By the way, Aunt, didn't we just talk about the police? Just call them. - Greetings. - Greetings. Jagteshwar, you? - Yes. - Pitar, listen to me. He is JabarJang Singh's son. - Greetings. - They are extremely wonderful people. I have been telling you since an hour that I come from a good family. He is my elder brother. Sit down. Sit down. The way that you are embarrassing us you will definitely end this family soon. I apologize on their behalf. You can take whatever strict action that you want against them. Uncle is the one who will take action now. - He is coming. - No, no, brother. He wanted to tell you for a long time. He was scared of you. Who is trying to lure and trap my innocent niece? - Greetings, brother. - No, Jagteshwar Singh, my friend. I did not expect this from you. No, brother, you are misunderstanding me. It wasn't me. It was my younger brother. Jagteshwar Singh, come close to me. Jagteshwar, we are in a big problem, my friend. - Which problem, brother? - Global warming. My friend, the scientific breakthroughs that we have made have been misused and it is destroying mankind and animals and insects, my friend. Which has deeply affected nature and the circle of life. You are right. Can we think about the girl? Marriage is not an achievement. To run away from home and get married, getting a court marriage done is not an achievement, Son. An achievement is to discover a bulb. An achievement is to understand the quirks of human nature. Read this book. And before your wedding, read this and discuss it with me, Son. What happened? By the way, Jaggi had to take this step because of your principles. Principles are not important for everyone. I don't know what your love for your principles is. A principled man cannot live without principles. Just like a fish cannot stay without water. Do you know that some fish die in the water? Okay, listen to me. There is a function in my friend's circle tomorrow and you are invited. And please, be ready tomorrow. I will not go. Must you say no to everything first? I have especially told them that my friend will come. And on principle, you should come with me. But if you are an unprincipled man then... I will go. Really? Give me a high-five. Your hands haven't been sanitized. The germs can be interchanged. Okay, okay,okay. "Oh, my lazy bird, if this lasts again." "It is very sad, makes me feel so sad." "You can fly away." "In the sky away." "You are luckier than me." "You are luckier than me." "You are luckier than me." Andy, you were so good! Wasn't she? We love you, Andy. Joseph, we missed you last Sunday. Oh, don't get jealous, honey. You know I always come back. As you all know that we hang out here. We chill, we laugh and so many talented people light up this stage all the time, right? I have a secret to tell you. We have a very talented person sitting with us right now. Would you like to see him perform? So, please, welcome Jag! Jagteshwar Singh. I have neither sang in front of people nor I will be able to do it. Look, friends, he is saying that he has never sang in front of people before. Listen, I won't force you. There is a chair here and there is a chair there. Sit wherever you feel. But this moment, don't remember it later and say that I wish... This I wish troubles us our entire lives. "Today the chain of time has been broken." "Carelessness has embraced us." "Today she is being sung like a song." "The one who came as a poem." "The one who came as a poem." "If my lover is happy then God is happy." "If my lover is happy then God is happy." "I am an infidel," "She is a cleric." "If my lover is happy then God is happy." "If my lover is happy then God is happy." "The vessels are breakable, the promises are serious." "So many people have grazed buffaloes in love." "So many have gone crazy in love and danced." "She is like a dream, she is like the wind." "I am like the barren land and she is like the monsoon." "The ones who lose in love," "They win in life." "If my lover is happy then God is happy." "If my lover is happy then God is happy." "If my lover is happy then God is happy." "If my lover is happy then God is happy." "I have put sugar in a strainer." "It is now scattered everywhere." "It's fragrance is absolutely divine." "She is like a flying butterfly." "She has poked me gently and said something about love." "She has asked the sleeping Jassar to wake up." "I have welcomed this." "And she has sung a prayer." "If my lover is happy then God is happy." "If my lover is happy then God is happy." "If my lover is happy then God is happy." "If my lover is happy then God is happy." "Today the chain of time has been broken." "Carelessness has embraced us." "Today she is being sung like a song." "The one who came as a poem." "The one who came as a poem." How was it today? Thanks for today. If I hadn't asked then you wouldn't have thanked me, right? No, I was thinking about it. Oh, how do you think so much? The time that you take to think, in the same time, a guy will propose to a girl and have five to seven babies who would call him dad, dad. Then there's you. You think so much to say thank you. The other day you apologized the next day. You definitely must have stayed up all night and thought about it, isn't it? Should I apologize or not? Should I apologize or not? Right? You mustn't think so much. We have got such a short life. Say what you want and do what you must. What if you think about something and that doesn't have a positive response, then? What if it does? Well, you won't be able to say it yourself so I think that I'll have to say it. Tell me, who is the girl? I will talk to her. Look, I can do that much for friendship. I fear what if I lose her as a friend while looking for a life partner? You can't love by thinking so much you can only make deals. Just a second. Hi, dad. Yes. Hello, tell mom that I will not come back home. Okay? This time I will shatter her ego and then return. Apology? And me? Okay, bye, dad. Say you're sorry. Do you know... if I hadn't apologized to you then would we have become friends? Never. Amber, sorry is a very small word and it saves the biggest relationships. Don't you feel that you misbehave a lot with your family? I don't think so. This is not a joke. They must have a lot of expectations from you. They have sacrificed such precious time of theirs over you. You don't even speak to them properly over the phone let alone sit with them. Amber... you should win your parents over not try to win against them. What you said is true. I have understood it too. But, Jagteshwar, how much of your time do you give to your family? I am far from my family because of being overly careless and you are far from your family because of being over-principled. I felt very good today. The whole family sat and laughed together after so long. I laughed with them too. Do you know that laughing increases blood too? The blood gets cleaned too. But why didn't you come and sit with everyone? I am going home. Are you upset about something? I have come to my senses. Your whole family got together and I am very happy. We are together because of you. But I have never sat together with my family. Sorry is such a small word, isn't it? It saves the biggest relationships. Thank you, Jagteshwar, to you and your family for making me understand the value of my family. I feel like you should stay here for another few days. No, I need to apologize... to someone too. Hi, dad. My child is here? But you made a mistake. If you had waited another day then you would have won against your mom. But you came on the fourteenth day. Dad, I have learnt this in these fourteen days that it is not important to win against parents rather, it is important to win them over. My child. - It's alright then. - Mummy. Throw your bag on some couch. We'll pick it up ourselves. You should have fun. - Enjoy. - Mom. Sorry, mom. I have nothing to say other than this. You must adjust with this sorry. I was born from you, silly. Won't you forgive me? Drama-queen. Come on now, let me make some food. No, from now on, all the household chores will be divided in this house. The unoccupied people will get work and the ones who work will get rest. Oh, hello? - Did you call me unoccupied? - Yes. Then it's fine. If you had said that about your mom then I wouldn't have spared you. - Tea. - Thanks. - Amber, my child. - Yes, dad? - Your mom and I have decided something. - What? We want to become... grandparents. Very good. Go right ahead. You will have to get married for that. No, dear dad, let your beautiful, delicate daughter enjoy in this house for a little while. Please. Amber, today or tomorrow you will become someone's daughter-in-law, right? 'Brother, there is a problem.' No one will turn on the TV in this house from today onwards. Jaggi, you will study for ten hours every day. After that, you will enjoy watching TV for a whole hour. But only news. So that your general knowledge can be improved. Mom, you are free after finishing your chores in the kitchen. Okay, Amber. After that, meditate one hour daily. Dad, your diet will be increased. And your three thousand steps per day are cancelled. You will walk ten thousand steps per day. He can be lenient when it comes to these rules but I am very strict about them. No one will be spared. Uncle and Aunt, what are you watching? If you aren't going to talk good things then at least dream about good things. Oh, no. I was telling your Aunt that after marriage women follow their husband's instructions. You're just talking nonsense. I didn't follow your instructions. Whatever it is, Uncle, I say that we won't find a better girl than Amber for this house and Jagteshwar. And as it is, Uncle, no one is going to let you eat unhealthy food and desserts. If we look at it from that prespective then really the girl isn't that bad. The girl is not bad, your intention is bad. I was saying that who will talk to our jailer? We should all talk to him bit by bit. Here he comes. Do it, Aunt. The girl had made this house so lively. I can still see her walking around. You are absolutely right. - The poor girl cooked such delicious food. - True. Now we will again have to eat what you cook. Why? Don't I make delicious food? Man, you better stop talking nonsense. - You are the one who asked me to praise the girl. - Uncle. Look, Aunt, everyone is missing Amber. Isn't it, brother? What's there to miss? She had to return to her own family. Yes, she had to return home. She wasn't going to keep sitting here. But, son, what if we keep her here permanently? Keep her if you want to but this time we must charge her rent. Uncle... Rent is normal. Son, if you like Amber than shall we discuss it further? Mom, don't say such things. You know that I don't want to get married yet. Admit it or not but since she left there is no joy on your face either. Oh, Sundar, when Rani was meeting you every day why didn't you propose to her then? Now you are standing here with a long face. Pardon me, library. Read further. Did Sundar get Rani or not? What? I feel like you have become interested too. Sit. Sundar got in the bus and got off at the bus station near Rani's village. He thinks to himself that I will tell Rani how I feel today. But when he goes home, he sees that Rani is getting married. Poor Sundar is left with nothing. If Sundar had expressed his feelings for Rani at the right time then today, Rani would be Sundar's and Sundar would be Rani's. Wow. What did that family feed you? You have changed so much in fourteen days. Dad, what such difference have you seen in me? There is so much difference. The room is so clean, everything is kept in such an organized way, reading books in the morning. Amber, I was thinking, had you lost your mind earlier or have you lost it now? You should be happy, dad, that your daughter has become wise, Okay? Okay, tell me, who is this great man who has taught my daughter so many things? Dad, there is always some such person in the world whose influence your heart accepts without telling you. I have understood now that life shouldn't be so unprincipled too. So, overall, I learnt that the first and the last principle of a beautiful life is balance. You are on the right track. We can get you married now. At least your in -laws won't suffer because of you. They are very nice. - Who? - My in-laws family. Does that mean that you got married? No, dad. I have just chosen my in-laws yet. I am confused about the boy. Come, let's talk to that boy. Oh, no. Not yet, okay? Let him suffer in my love a little. - He will come himself. - When? When he comes the lights will flicker. Jaggi, won't you hoot tonight? Never be scared when I am here. What do you think that I am scared of my son? I am not scared of anyone. The day I am drunk and he comes in front of me, I will thrash him so much that everyone... everyone will watch. Uncle, your wish has been granted. Brother is behind you. Thrash him. What is all this talk about thrashing? Sometimes you talk about thrashing, then you talk about grabbing, - sometimes you say I'll keep watching TV. - Uncle... Do whatever anyone can. Uncle, when did I say that? You make me sit and drink with you every day. - Pour. - What? Go ahead and pour. "Come on, do it." - Does he drink too? - I don't know. We drank secretly from him and he drank secretly from us. - Here you go. - Her you go, brother. "Come on, do it." You should carry on. Pour some more. Uncle, I think he will get us drunk and thrash us. I... I am your dad. If you have anything in your heart you should tell me clearly. I have fallen in love with Amber. - Jaggi. - Yes? Don't make another drink for me. I think that I am drunk. I have really fallen in love and that too in huge proportions. Uncle... I don't feel drunk anymore. I will go and get Aunt. - Aunt! - Hey, why are you making noise? Make the arrangements quickly and bring the girl home in a simple ceremony. Who knows he may deny it all in the morning? I have moved quite ahead from the stage of denial. Now I just need to ask Amber once whether she loves me or not. She loves our entire family, Son. Yes. You just say yes once and the poor girl will come running like a tortoise. Uncle, tortoise walks really slow. I know that. She will come slowly and think while she comes. Because she needs to make such a huge decision. I will go and talk to her tomorrow. If she agrees then it's fine. What if she doesn't agree? Hey, mom. - Sit. - Jagteshwar? You? I came to meet you. I have to discus something precious with you. Precious or important? Can we talk alone? - If you don't mind. - Yes. Yes, mom... Come, let's go outside. - Excuse me. - Okay, Son. I like the boy. We liked the last fifteen boys too. It's important that Amber should like the boy. Go on and tell me what precious thing you want to discuss. No, I think that... maybe this ambience doesn't suit that topic. Or the topic doesn't suit the ambience. I know all about your perfect management. Mister, are you going to talk or just talk around in circles? Okay, you will remember this. Tell me where do you want to go? But I feel that to discuss that topic, time and ambience both can be more beautiful than this. Shall we meet in the evening? I will send you the postal code. I do know what you want to say. But I want to hear you say it. Jagteshwar... "Your reflection is in me." "Like the moon in the glass." "I can see you." "But I cannot have you." "I am unfortunate and those paths" "Are meaningless." "I have reached my destination and yet" "I cannot go there." "The stories of my love" "Were one-sided." "I started it" "But I couldn't complete it." "You are like a dream." "And I saw you with so much hope." "There is just one problem." "I could not get you." "You are like a dream." "And I saw you with so much hope." "There is just one problem." "I could not get you." Mr Singh, we did our best. It's a major spinal injury. Actually, what happened is she will never be able to walk again. But if... God wills then she can even get better with proper care and treatment. And I have a lot of examples like this. Rest will depend mostly on the patient's willpower. Sir, may I... Sorry, Mr Singh. We can't allow anybody in right now. Actually, the patient needs complete rest for the next few days. So until then... Excuse me. The doctor said that Amber can never walk on her feet again. But what does he know? Amber has never walked on her feet. She has always flown in the air with her wings. And no one... can stop her from flying in the air. Right, Amber? That's nice of you. You taught me to talk and you are silent now. Now that I want to live freely, you have tied yourself to these machines. Do you know? Walking with you, roaming around with you, spending time, laughing... I used to really like it. It seemed like nothing is more beautiful than love. Now you are in pain... but I am not able to tolerate it. Now it feels like there is nothing more painful than love. Get up and talk to me. I always thought that I need to tell you what's in my heart. But sometimes I used to feel that the time is not right. Sometimes I used to feel that the place is not right. But I have learnt one thing from you. Time is never wrong neither is the place. One should say what's in their heart. Now there can be no better time and place than this. I love you, Amber. Will you marry me? Remember one thing. Your over-carelessness and my over-principled rules never let us embrace each other. I am ready now. You are wasting time. And also, the doctor said that you can't meet the patient. It is a hospital rule. The rule that stops me from meeting Amber... I will obey no such rule of this world. I broke the rule and I'm standing right here. Jagteshwar... Jagteshwar... Amber. Doctors say that so that the patients shouldn't catch an infection. Some rules are important, right? I have learnt that from you. I... I forgot to sanitize my hands... But I had no intention of spreading any infection. I was leaving anyway. You should rest. Won't you embrace me? No, what is the use of a one-sided embrace? It will be from both sides. The embrace is enjoyable when the girl is standing in front of you. That's how marriage is enjoyable then too. At least you don't deserve an insufficient girl, Mr Perfect. Insufficiency is life. To be complete is the end. And you should be grateful that... you didn't die. Is that funny? No, it was a joke. I admit it wasn't a healthy joke. But I thought we can laugh about it.
