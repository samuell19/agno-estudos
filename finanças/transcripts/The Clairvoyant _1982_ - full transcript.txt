The preliminary examination showed no signs of trauma in those areas. I'm listing the cause of death as asphyxiation due to drowning. Look at his ankle, Tom. Almost ripped his leg off trying to cut loose from that steel ladder. - Mm. - These cuffs are unregistered. You can buy 'em anywhere. To get this body cuffed and attached to the bottom rung of a pool ladder, the killer had to be a goddamn ape. Or a bull. His friends claim that he was past exhaustion before he even got into the pool. Did over 300 push-ups. Seems he was seeing some girl who liked her men strong. [scoffs] Poor bastard. He ain't so strong now. [chuckles] He will be in a few days. That girl they found in the river, she was handcuffed, too. That's right, Tom. Same as these, impossible to trace. The uniform characteristics in both cases indicate that they were both handled by the same strongman. Uniform characteristics? What the hell do you know about uniform characteristics?

This is Paul McCormack, and the show's called, "Talk Back." This morning, I wanna read you a letter I received from, uh, Mary Smith. "Dear Mac, I don't know about the rest of the world, but I'm scared to death of the streets. Living alone is no joke, and after the murder of that poor girl they found in the river, the handcuffs, the mutilation, I'm considering doing one of two things, becoming a recluse or moving away." And signed, Mary Smith. There's no address, but there is a P.S. "Mary Smith is not my real name. You think I'm stupid, or something? Nobody's going to get me." I think the point is that we have to ask ourselves, what person doesn't suffer from "Mary Smith paranoia," and with good reason. Everyday we hear about murder, mutilation, gunnings, knifings, I mean, the list goes on and on. Gory details served up with your coffee and morning newspaper, but that's our reality. And we can't escape it by simply burying our heads in the sand and pretending it isn't so. This morning, I wanna focus on the Betty Mercer case. Iris in on the murdered girl who was found floating in the Hudson River a few days ago. What people don't know is that the night before last, the murderer left his calling card. A pair of handcuffs around the wrist of the man he electrocuted... That's not in this format. And the ankle of another man he drowned. [over tape recorder] "And say goodnight, Gracie." [audience laughing over tape recorder] [Mac] What one detective called "a-a two-bagger," has been buried by a particular police lieutenant. And although the hunt is on to find this maniac, the point that Mary Smith makes is absolutely right. Stay in your house, or move away from the Big Apple, because there's a nut out there with a pair of handcuffs. Maybe we... [phone trilling] Guess who. It's Werner Armstrong. [groaning] [sighs] Christ! When they clam up, under orders, about a killer, a handcuff killer, who's beginning to look like another Son of Sam, well then, maybe it's time that the press had something to do about it. So, "Talk Back." What do you think? I think you've got my ass in a sling. [sigh] [exhales] [scoffs] No, I swear, Lieutenant, uh... I swear to God, Lieutenant... I swear to God, Lieutenant Cullum, I didn't say a word. [sighs] Shit! [picture frame clatters] [car door closes] You've just started on the job, and now, you pull this. Look, Channel 6 is not in the tabloid business, Mac. You know how concerned we are with station image. I had a tough time selling "Talk Back" and you. The phones haven't stopped ringing, Werner. The word now is that you are aiding and abetting. Oh, that's Cullum, he blocked information, now he's trying to cover his ass. - Oh, come on, Mac. - He's blocking the press.

As long as the public is listening to me, they're listening to Channel 6. Okay. Have a nice lunch. Four Seasons. [car door closes, engine starts] [TV reporter] Police officials have declined to comment. A Con Edison employee was electrocuted while working with high-tech computer lines. The man has been identified as James Dearden, a three year employee with the company. Reports from the scene seem to indicate murder, but no motive is apparent at this time. Police are continuing the investigation of the bizarre, handcuffed murder of a young woman whose sexually molested and abused body was found floating in the Hudson River two days ago. According to police sources, the woman has been tentatively identified as Betty Mercer, a young model... [woman giggling] evidence pointing to similarities in all three of these recent deaths has been made public by local talk show host, Paul McCormack on his program "Talk Back." McCormack contends that the use of handcuffs is a link in these grizzly murders. Police deny McCormack's allegations and refused to comment. Police Commissioner...

Have you ever had this kind of experience before? Yes, I was 16. How long ago was that? I was a senior in high school, um... I was in art class, sketching. In the music room next door, I... I heard someone playing the piano. It was springtime. I remember the smell of apples, something sweet. The sun was very bright. I hear something at the window. There she is. Who? Elizabeth, that was her name. Just a little girl who'd been lost for about two days. You mean, you saw her outside the window. No. You watched her, like watching TV or something? No, I was with her. I was on the same street with her. She was lost. She didn't know what to do, so she wandered down a footpath into a vacant lot. And? What did you do? Well, I told my mother about it, and she knew that Elizabeth was lost. How'd your mother know Elizabeth was lost? She had the gift, too. The gift? Clairvoyance. She did automatic handwriting. Your hand takes over and, uh... Well, it's very hard to explain, especially when no one believes you. Did you find the girl? Yes. Elizabeth Cotteray. Well, I went back to the same room, and I drew another picture. Same thing started happening all over again. Get me the Mercer file. The light from the window... It's like a pull from outside myself, out on the same street with Elizabeth. I see the street sign. It's Holloway and Park. And my hand draws this. It's like a hypnotic trance. Yes.

Apparently, I got too close to him for comfort, and these are what I have to show for it. No thanks to the police. I got a pretty good idea that these things are covered with his fingerprints. Also, I can make a very accurate description of the man. And I don't intend to let up on this, not for a moment, whatever the pressures. Also...

Now, I don't know what these mean, but... I feel they're coming at me. Coming at you? [clears throat] All right, well, we'll add these to our collection, and, uh... I'm not going to let anything happen to you. Okay? That's a nice-colored sweater. Oh, uh, my sister's. My kid sister, yeah, you remind me of her. - Oh, yeah? Yeah, your eyes. I knew there was something. I-I didn't know you had a kid sister. Ah, I don't, but if I did, I know... You'd remind me of her exactly. - [giggling] It's a long story, I really was hoping maybe I... I could tell it to you over dinner, and, uh... I do a stand-up comic, and... I'm gonna do my act tonight. I thought... you might come with me. I have a date. Oh. Uh, Mac? [Weeks] Hmm. Well, you could break that. [chuckling] I mean, Mac's, uh, very involved, uh, plotting Lieutenant Cullum's downfall anyway, he's... Go right back to the drawing board and... What do you say? [light piano music ♪] Yeah, I could break it. [Weeks] Yeah? Yeah. [Virna laughing] - Gee, if I-I'd known it was this far, I mean, I-I... I'd brought my canteen or my camel.

[comedian] Uh, people don't realize what it's like to be a school teacher in this day and age. My kids have difficulty remembering my name, uh, Wolfberg, you wouldn't think all that tough, and they call me "Wolfman" and, uh, "Wolfgang." I had a kid, first day of school, call me "Wolfshit," uh... - [crowd laughing] - which is a logical mistake for a child to make, I guess. Uh, I had a little girl, Kathleen Lewis. Uh, nice girl, but she had a health problem a, uh, chronic gastrointestinal, uh, disorder and, uh, wasn't funny, wasn't funny. She-she used to emit prodigious amounts of gas. And, uh... And well, kids are merciless. Uh, they used to call her Earth, Wind, and Fire. [crowd laughing] - Uh... [applause] Thank you very much, very much. I was with a lady in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, little while back, and... who thought of me as nothing more than a sex object. I assumed that was the case, she called me a dildo. [crowd laughing] I said thank you very much. Uh, it's a different world with you ladies now. I read the Hite report, the survey of- of female sexuality, very interesting. They found, th-they found, for example, that over 60 percent of all women in America, according to the Hite report, have at one point or another, faked an orgasm. Sir, that's not your fault, I'm, uh... I'm sure, uh... I was subjected to this particular phenomenon once. Once-once that I know of, anyway, okay, because on this particular occasion she wasn't really very, very good at it. Uh... [chuckles] She had no sense of timing. We weren't even having sex. [crowd laughing] We were having lunch. She didn't fool nobody. - Here's the phone, okay? - 'Kay, thanks. Hello? Muriel? [whispering over phone] Virna Nightbourne? Yes? I have Muriel Watson with me, outside. She's in the truck across from the stage door. Who is this? It's now ten minutes of ten.

Late last night, the Handcuff Killer attempted a hit and run on Miss Virna Nightbourne. So let me introduce my guest to you right now. I want to point out to you that you see before you the two latest intended victims of the Handcuff Killer. Like me, Virna was getting a little too close to him for comfort, but with an entirely different method. Suppose you tell us now, Virna, exactly what you've been doing that, uh, drew the killer's attention to you. Um... [clears throat] I'm a student at the Art Students League, and, uh, one afternoon I was sketching and... it was in life class. I thought I heard something... at the window behind me. And... then I...

Where were you last night? - Hey, you know what you've done? - What have I done? - You realize what you've done? - I haven't done a damn thing! [overlapping shouting] - Oh, just stop it! I think Virna would like you to leave. Hey, you get out of here. We're here on police business. You get the hell out of here. You call me later. You're a tough man, Weeks. Miss Nightbourne, did Miss Watson say anything last night? Did she get a look at the killer? No, she said she didn't see him. She didn't see his face. Well, he thought she did. If there's any information... - Lou, give me some time, will ya? Now, get a suitcase and pack some things, all right? What for? Because you've gotta get outta here! How easy do you wanna make it for this maniac? Do you understand what is goin' on here? Dammit, what's the matter with you? Don't you understand? - Go away! You cannot stay here! [Lou] Weeks? Weeks, let's go. [Virna sobbing] [door closing] I wanna talk to you. - You got a warrant? - Look, I don't care what you think. It's Virna I'm concerned about. She's not safe there. I know she'd stay with you. At least I'd know where she is. Sure, fine. But I want you to stay away. And if there's any more police business, send Cullum. [ominous music ♪] Mill, I still don't understand. What are you tryin' to do? Tryin' to solve your little puzzle. Well, why do ya keep movin' them around? Just separating the realistic ones from the others. Now, we know this is... Burt Johnson... the college kid. [sighs] This is Betty Mercer... I made a new drawing. Has anyone seen it? Did you show it to Weeks? No. This is the first time I've drawn them all together. This is great, I want you to come back on my show with this, okay? So then they were all together there when Betty Mercer was killed. Yes. There's the boy who drowned in the pool. There's the Con Ed man who was electrocuted. Who's this? The killer. Or the next victim. Then I have to go back and draw again. I have to draw his face. Now this one, she said was of something that belonged to the killer. [muttering] Let's see... Look at this. Look how the dark mass in this... realistic drawing is also in this one. And this section is no more than a... blow-up of this. [sighs] I-I can't. - Okay, all right. - I'm just, I'm too tired. Okay, I want you to lie down and rest for a while, okay? Come in the other room. Okay. I'll call Cullen. We'll show him the drawing. These jagged lines do look like the teeth of open handcuffs.
