♪ It's just a sunny day I was just a girl from music school. Kind of a dork like everyone else. At school I met Mel and Ben. We became best friends, band mates, a songwriting trio, my tribe. Now we live together and make music together in a cool house in Malibu. Mel's uncle loaned it to us for the summer. I really love it here. We were living the dream. But wait, I'm getting ahead of myself. Now, it's time to jam. Yeah. That might be the single. That was orgasmic. Yeah, I think it sounded great. Let me just work on some lines. We all got day jobs. Ben worked for Mr. Martin, our weird neighbor, doing sound design. Melanie was producing at a rock label and I was, well, waitressing and auditioning, of course. And now that I was living in L.A., there were endless weddings, baby showers, and family get togethers. Okay, mama, goodbye. Excited for the big family weekend? Hell, no. Well they love you and so do we. Love you. Oh, it's Barry. Hi, Barry. Yes, I know. I didn't forget two triple red-eye lattes, bagels and Advil. I'm on my way, bye. Hey ya. Hi. What? The label loved our demo. Yes. They want five more songs, but full mixes is not garage band demos. How are we ever gonna afford this? Uh, would Barry let us mix at night? Doubt it. What are we talking'? Like 10, 20? No, try 30, 40 thousand. This label is amazing. Hey, hey, we'll get another shot. Uh, do you mind feeding Max tonight. I might be late. Uh, work or hot date? Maybe both? Oh, another lead guitarist kinda dude? No, maybe the bass player for the Silicon Beaches. Vanessa Lee? Oh dude, she's smokin' hot. What I say I only date guys under 30 or female rockers on Twitter, no strings. Yeah, flawless plan, I must say. Hey, Ben. When my uncle sells this house, free rent's over. We have to make this demo. We have to find the money. Mel worked as a studio engineer for one of the best rock labels in Hollywood but her boss gave a whole new meaning to the word jerk. All right, I'm gonna take five. Good luck. Hey, Barry, I was wondering if I could talk to you about something. Find me the next Blockheads yet? You got good ears, kid. That's what I pay you for. But actually that's not what I wanted to talk to you about. I was wondering if maybe we could use your studio just for a few nights. What, you mixing, in my studio? Mel, I got news for you. We got eight bands with new albums I gotta finish. We'll talk about you in the studio when things slow down. Next summer maybe. Call me Saturday by nine Am with notes on this and take those morons out on the town, limos, bottle service, whatever. Just make sure they bring us the next album. Yeah, sure. Sorry, oops. Excuse me. Sorry. Ready to impress, darling? Yeah I thought they wanted a soprano. There's like 50 guys here. Do they ever know what they want? ♪ Do they baby ♪ Do they baby You got this. Alejandra Martin? Soprano? I see here you went to Julliard. Impressive, but what's your instrument? Violin, mostly, and voice. Violin handy. Tina, queue up the spot. ♪ Shiny and clean ♪ That's what it means ♪ Washing those jeans ♪ Till they're shiny ♪ And clean I think its kind of breathy. Nice job, we'll let you know. Another audition bombed. Thank god I had my friend Steven to help cheer me up. He was always bailing me out. And Ben worked for our neighbor at a video gaming company. He was a little odd, too. Oh like you just rolled out of bed, big guy. Not exactly. Dude, its all over your face. You and the roommates going at it 24/7. Rob, seriously, its not like that. Take it from a married guy. Don't ever get hitched. Keep on doing the dream team. Boom! Soldier, 0900 and 58 seconds you are late. Sir, I uh. At ease, son. So how's the booby trap sound effects going? We need big boobies and I mean big. Yeah be done today. Atta boy. Say, Ben. How does it all work with you and those girls? Work? Yeah you know like, I mean. Any jealousy, are there any rules? Uh rules? Yeah. I get it. Mums the word, right? Mums the word. Sir, I need to get back to this. Oh you keep up the good work, all right? And you say hello to those gals from me. While I was dealing with my life I had forgotten something very important. Oh how was your date with Vanessa? She play your drums? She wanted to do something romantic, you know like dinner. Yuck. So I went out with Nick the label rep instead. Oh and? He's turning 31. Who knew? I had to end it. Ally would kill you if she saw you doing that. So Julie's baby's party is at two. You're gonna come right? Uh yeah sure. Today's the day isn't it? Yeah. One year later, one shitty drunk driver. Well, I'll stay home, we'll hang. No, no I'm okay. Really. Come to Julies maybe? Its probably better if your around people. Hey Mel, if you become a big time music producer you wouldn't leave us, would you? Benjamin, no matter what happens we'll always be together, you, me, and Ally. We're family now. Today was the day Ben's parents died. Head on car crash, so awful. I should of remembered, I should of been there for him. We're band mates. You just don't forget that kind of stuff. Hello, everyone. I'm Cassie, I'll be taking over for Maya today. This is an advanced class. So I hope you're all ready to work. All right, let's get started. Arms above your head. Back foot at a 45 degree angle. Hands together and look to the sky. Virabhadrasana 2. Warrior 2 pose. Open up, adjust your foot back. Now squeeze your glutes and lift your abdomen. Arms up above your head. That's it. Now breathe. Now release into gravity with happy baby. This opens chakras, releases tension, and heightens sexual awareness. A little wider, sweetie. That's it, perfect. Thanks. Hey. You have amazing potential. You're kidding. No, not at all. You just need to clear your mind a little bit. Its nice to meet you. Cassie, I'm Cassie. - Nice to meet you. - I'm Melanie, hi. All right, well I hope to see you in class again. Okay. I mean yeah yeah, sure, totally. Well nice to meet you, Melanie. So I met the most amazing girl today. Oh so you're ready to settle down now get a little condo in West Hollywood? Geeze, what happened to no strings? Shut up, okay, really. Hi, cutie. Okay so you two would make a really cute couple. When you getting married? Very funny. You know your my favorite cousin, right? You know I'm serious right. I am getting a beer. Do you? I'll have soda water, please. Vodka soda, double vodka. Honey. Oh thank you. He's getting so big. Okay, he's a total catch. You've got to admit it. Yeah thanks for the tip. You know he's my roommate right? Uh did you see his butt? And his blue eyes? Come on. You never think about having kids. Maybe, I don't know. Why you asking me all this weird shit? Because you've got to settle down. Look guy or girl, you've just to take the plunge. Girls are even crazier than guys in LA. Oh really? So who are you seeing? Nobody. You know you could try dating somebody with a day job instead of an app and van. Just saying. I love what I do. Besides, since you and Paul got married you guys have been like building an empire. You don't think we did this all on our own? God no. Thank you, Ben. No, we got help from the trust fund. Trust fund, what trust fund? Yours, mine, and your sisters. The Merna Rothman trust fund. Every female in the family inherits a piece and when she gets married, she gets to do whatever she wants with it. She gets to invest or travel, party, donate. I thought that was just a myth. So did I until the check showed up. Who's Merna? She was our great grandmother. She wanted all the Rothman girls to have a little nest egg. And the trust paid for all of this? Yeah put a down payment on the house, launched our catering business, and it got us a part time nanny. So Merna's husband made bazillions in the prophylactic business. Just out of curiosity. How much do girls get for tying the knot? Well after taxes, about 450 thousand, give or take. 450... This Merna sounds great. Yeah I've always liked independent woman. Oh and Mel, for the foreseeable future you know the trust only works if you get married to a guy. So just fine a man that you like and get married. Otherwise you're gonna end up working for someone for the rest of your life. It just doesn't seem right. What do you mean right? You deserve it. Get married, get the money. While they were at Julie's I left my family early. I had some news of my own. Hey you're back early. Uh yeah I kinda had to leave. I did a terrible thing. No Oscar is so not for me. He's sweet. He's old fashioned, conservative. He's not some flashy LA guy. Oscar is husband material. He loves his family. Owns a great business. Plus he and your dad watch football like all the time. What? And he's hot. He gives me night sweats every time I look at him. Oh I better go check on my husband. Yeah you do that. Ally. Hi. Oscar. How are you? Good, hey. How are you? Fine. You look beautiful. Come on, I want to hear everything about LA. Let me get you a drink. I did my part. Now its up to Oscar. Its good to have you home. Just like old times. Yeah. No, it feels good. Being here. Oscar was one of those great guys. So handsome, sweet, and totally not right for me. Ally. I know we dated in high school and to you it must seem like a million years ago but I've always loved it here and there's just been one person missing. Oscar, please. I love you. I have always loved you. Ally. Will you marry me? I promise I'll make you happy. Please say yes. My career was important and I didn't just want babies and family barbecues. Is that a yes? He's so dependable. are dependable. I want a man that I'm crazy about. Love grows. Oscar is a good man. Yes and he will make someone else very happy. Just give me one good reason why you won't marry him. Because. And then I told my mom the biggest lie of my almost adult life. Because mom I'm engaged. What? Darling, why didn't you say so. My high school boyfriend proposed and my whole family was pressuring me. I just saw my whole life unfolding. You know babies, diapers. So so many diapers. So you said you were. Getting married? Yes, yes, I lied. I totally la la lied. And they were so happy. Yeah but wait married to who? No fricking way. Oh my goodness. His name just popped into my head. I swear. I need to call my family. I'm gonna need a drink first. We got to do something. We? No, no there's no we here. You're the fiance. Come on, look she's a mess, Mel. Oh god. For a second marrying Ben almost sounded good. That's what Julie said. Wait? I'm kidding. I'm not. Let's get married. Huh, what, who? You, me, Mel. The three of us. We just found out that if I get married I inherit a bunch of money from a family trust fund. $450,000 just for getting hitched. To a guy that is. Oh my god. Mel is this true? Girls, this is the answer. Two brides, one groom. You've been spending way too much time talking to Chris about his three way lesbians fantasies. I told you, we're just not into it. No. But wait a second. I kind of want to hear this little scheme. You have one minute, Ben. Okay. So first, Mel tells her family that after years of friendship, she and I fell in love and eloped. Mel gets the trust money, produces a kick ass demo and we are on our way. I'm talking Grammys, multi platinum albums. Okay keep talking, especially about that Grammy part. Okay so then Ally and I, we have a big wedding. I'm talking grandma, the cousin. No that would never... Bet your mom already put the wedding announcement in the paper. No listen. Ladies, the trust money will let us stay together and work on our music. Me and my band mates, who just happen to be my two beautiful brides. Oh my god this so is your lesbian fantasy. No, no it is a career move for all of us. So you're saying you would actually go through a real wedding? Its one weekend then back to normal. Normal right. I don't know, my parents would figure it out. We'd be married before they could say mazel tov. Mel, this is your chance. Okay produce a hit record, make it in the big time. Yeah, maybe work with Pharrell. Ben, wait, what do you get out of all this? If the records a hit I get to quit my day job and you know, we get to stay together. Us, this little family of ours. I want that. You know, we already raise a dog and share a Netflix account. Come on, our odds are better than most couples. We're not a couple, we're a trio. Semantics. Are we gonna do this? You're crazy but I'm in. Ally? Forgive me, god. I'm in. So that was it. The double wedding plan was in motion. Except we forgot about one new person in the mix. Cassie. Hey. So I guess I didn't scare you off. No I've been trying to make it everyday. Have you? Wait did you got to my eight o'clock? Sorry, I switched it to 10. Oh yeah yeah you weren't there. Oh, sorry. Oh I got it. Oh you live on Ocean, I live on Dune. Oh no way. Well hey, neighbor. We should hang out sometime. Sure, yeah I'd like that. Do you like biking? Love hiking. Love love love it. Well I meant biking. But actually, why don't you come over to my place tonight for a barbecue? Yeah Milo's having some people over. Oh Milo. Yeah he's moving to Costa Rica for a year to teach. So some friends are throwing him a little going away. Oh he's moving? Bummer. Yeah I'd love to come. All right cool. Well I probably should mention my friends are hardcore vegetarians. Yeah I love hardcore vegetarians. Yeah. All right, cool. Well I'll see you later then. - See you. - Bye. Mel was smitten. Mel, dating your yogi, enchante. So listen, Mel. Try not to talk too much about work. Okay, think two way conversation. All right? Just make her laugh, that's what women want. What? Seriously? As if you know what women want. No, Mel, women like to be listened to. Duh, everybody likes to be listened to. Show her you have some opinions. When have you ever listened to a woman? What, what. What do you mean? Okay why don't you guys stop bringing your issues into my date? Okay I'm just going to a vegetarian possibly semi lesbian barbecue. Okay, no big deal. He doesn't know the first thing about women. No. Off with the scarf. The hair, let's loosen this up. There, hot. How the hell do you do that? Its in the genes, sister. We're not talking Old Navy. Everybody, she's here. Hi. Come on in. Cassie, this is Ben and Ally my roommates. - Hello. - Nice to meet you. Hi, I'm Ben. Oh hi. Great earrings. Hey, where are you from? Mel says you teach yoga. Oh can I get you a beer? How long have you lived in Malibu. Are you wearing Narciso Rodriquez? Um I'm actually from San Francisco. A beer, no thanks. I teach ashtanga yoga and yes, I am wearing Narciso. Good job. Okay, ready, bye. Oh thanks. Ladies, hi. Listen, we're having a little get together tonight at our place and we were hoping you and your friend would be friendly and join us. Maybe some other time, thank you, though. If you change your mind we're here as in right here. Friendly neighbors. Yeah. You have no idea. Such a cute couple. Maybe Cassie can be our bridesmaid. So, we've got drinks inside. - Foods over there. - Yes. And everything's totally vegan. Thank goodness. Hi, good to see you. How are you? I'm good. Great actually. You look good. You look happy. I am. What can I get you? I'm gonna do two white wines maybe. Come on, its a Saturday. First date? Yes kind of. Nervous. You could say that. Listen, I make a mean skinny margarita. Okay. How bout a tequila float? I highly recommend. All right, I feel like I'm on vacation. Here's to a little first date good luck. Okay. These are beautiful. Okay love, I'll see you in a bit, bye. While Mel was busy falling in love she was forgetting we had two weddings to plan. But who can blame her? Who wouldn't love Cassie? She was pretty damn hot. I'm really glad we did this. Yeah, me, too. I had a really good time. I'd love to do it again. I mean hang out if you. I would love that. Well you're coming home with me. Okay. I'm so glad you came with me today. I really really like you. Meanwhile, Ben and I were still in our post college platonic romance. Ally, listen to this, this is new. ♪ Touch ♪ Open up ♪ A dead heart ♪ Always got you out of love ♪ Show you light ♪ And you hide ♪ And believe ♪ That's who you are ♪ Are Try it with me. ♪ Are Yeah, one more time. ♪ Are That's nice. Its cool, I like that a lot, yeah. hi, nice 18 hour barbecue. Yes we had a great time and no you may not ask any questions. Hey you seal the deal? That is so not any of your business. Yeah we totally hooked up. So you did? Yeah and it was amazing. Clearly you followed my advice. Your advice? You know what, I'll tell you something. You are so full of shit. You know nothing about this. I'm full of it? - Yes, absolutely. - Really? Uh huh. Now it was time to make our bond legit. Off to find our wedding rings. Lets find one we all like. Ben come here, your in on this, too. Sure. Oh that's nice. Ally look. Oh my god, that's gorgeous. How bout we just get something fake? Who's gonna know the difference? My family's already upset about the rushed wedding. You know least we can do is get a decent ring. Guys, cut me some slack. Its tough being the only groom. You know you do not have a romantic bone in your body. Is that any way to talk to your fiance? Excuse me, can we see these two? Absolutely. Lovely choice. So what is your return policy on wedding rings? Well we sincerely hope all of our matches are made in heaven but you have six weeks for a change of heart. Full refund, sweetie. Oh my god, Mel, it fits. Try it on. Well you two make a beautiful couple. No, no we're just roommates. Mel, try it on. Oh you don't have to hide your love here, sweetie. No at Diamonds are Forever we believe in tying the knot. Making a commitment is a wonderful thing as long as you do it with diamonds. Matching tattoos would be a lot cheaper. This is so expensive. You know. Wow, that is nice. Okay how bout we split this on three credit cards, you guys okay with that? - Yeah, cool. - Sure. All right well I'll just go wrap these up for the three of you. Be right back. We have the seating charts, the caterer, music. Flowers, bartender, menus. Oh thank god we're skipping a bachelorette. Sweetie if you want a bachelorette, we can throw you a bachelorette. No. - Here you go. - Are you sure? I'm fine. May I just say again, you're a beautiful couple and if that's your sperm donor, handsome devil. Great news about the demo man, you're an artiste. Its a gift from Jah. Its gonna be great to be get back in the studio. Oh no that you and Ally are getting married is Ally giving it to you? No bro, we're like brother and sister. Seriously, bro, like nothings going on? You're shitting me. Haven't you ever had a platonic relationship with a woman? With a woman, yeah? With a babe like Ally, dude no way. Just couldn't work, it be a waste. She's definitely a cool girl. I mean she's beautiful, she's smart and that body is just sick. I've even created my own mantra for her, dude. Ally, Ally Ally, om. You wouldn't care if I asked her out, right? Wait you want to ask Ally out? Yeah maybe. Like on a date. Like food, beverage, music, maybe even some weed. Like a nice date. What's the problem? What's the problem? What are you thinking? I'm thinking she's hot and I'm not interested in being her platonic buddy. That's your job, dude. Look, forget it, okay. You guys never work. Ally's a lesbian by the way. - Yeah she just told me. - You're freaking kidding me. Yeah tragic. But its her choice. We gotta respect that. So the next morning I got a package. My mother's wedding dress, she sent it. It was all getting very real. Dress rehearsal time. Mel and Ben were waiting to see me in it. Marrying Ben, my ex-boyfriend who cheated on me. I was nervous as hell. Who wouldn't be? Anyway, we had to go through with the plan. So, do I look like a real bride? You look incredibly beautiful. Wow. Yeah you do. Hey, Mel, look! Oh my god, Julie did this. What are you guys looking at? Uh Cassie, you're super early. Wait, what does that banner say? My cousin, she has a like weird sense of humor. I'll be right there. Okay. Nice dress. Yeah thanks. Its for a musical theater wedding thing. Mel should tell Cassie. What, just casually mention to the person that you're newly dating that you're actually getting married this weekend to your roommate. No sounds like an awesome date. Hey dance with me. Come on, I need the practice. Come on. Melanie. Hey what's up? Chad, I was. We're still on for Thursday, right? Yep. Cool, later. Friend? Yeah he's a, just a bass player. We work together, he's kind of a dork actually. Okay. What a dog. I know, right, total dog. I meant Ben. Oh god, I'm so sorry. Sometimes I just want to strangle him. You know? Hey gorgeous, long time. Hey, Philiba. You smell good. You coming to my show, right? No excuses, its my birthday. I'm spinning. Yeah, sure. Fantastic. Maybe we'll do a spa day first. I'll call you tomorrow. Let me guess, another dorky music friend? Yeah she. We just. Anybody want a beer, shots of tequila? Several shots maybe? Actually I'm gonna go home. Its been a long night. That was a nightmare. Girl that ship is gonna sail. Go talk to her. Oh look at that, Mel sweet talked her. You know Cassie's just the kind of girl I'd bring home to mom. And you, of course. You, then Cassie. Yeah that's if you were taking girls home to mom. Apart from some side drama at the club our two weddings were moving along, right on schedule. Yesterday was amazing. Yeah yeah better than most stag parties. Your wedding rocked. So honeymoon South Beach, yeah? Hell yeah! Guys, we are not having a honeymoon. But, Mel darling. Its time. What now?

So our friend Steven, he's a minister. Gathered here today to bring together Mel, Ben in holy matrimony. Mel, do you take this fantastically dressed sexpot of a man? I do. You may kiss the bride. Ally was my maid of honor and she also played the bongos which was really weird because nobody knew that she could play the bongos. Oh yeah it was so spiritual. Magical, almost. I mean I feel so blessed to have you know friends like these Ben feels the same way. My husband. Not yet. My husband. Not yet. Mel, seriously. Cut the crap. All right, you got married. Yes daddy. Mazel tov, I mean to who, Nick? No. That drummer, Vince? No, no not Vanessa, I mean Vince. Daddy I married Ben, my roommate. We're in love. So I said, what the heck? What the heck?

I always knew there was something going on between the two of you. Benjamin, I remember him. Yeah, yeah, sorta. Anyway, he's got a really good Jewish name. Actually he's Irish Catholic. Irish Catholic? Good and him. What's he do? Sound designer, computer stuff. Wonderful, he's employed. Thank god he's not a musician. He's a great guy. Handsome, smart.

Wait do you guys ever garden? Cassie, we need to talk. We'll give you some space. I don't quite know how to say this but a couple days ago I got married to Ben, just as friends, totally as friends. What? Wait, what are you talking about? And Ally also got married, coincidentally, to Ben just last Saturday in San Diego. I was her maid of honor but Ben and I just had this small intimate commitment ceremony. It wasn't a big deal. What do you mean no big deal? Well I mean I can explain because its about this trust fund, its not real its just for the demo. What's going on here? I thought we were on the same page. I am, we are on the same page. I just have to keep this wedding thing going for a little while longer for my family. Okay this is insane. You know how I feel and you went and staged a fake marriage for money and I'm supposed to be okay with that? Listen... No you listen. I've had to put up with your multiple dating, your bisexuality and your high sugar diet which makes you frankly, damn moody but I'm not gonna put up with a husband or a wife for that matter or whatever it is you guys are doing. Are you polygamists, is that what you are? Why did you just tell me you were polygamists? I mean you can do whatever you want in Utah but why didn't you just tell me? No we are not polygamists. Why does everybody think that? Well maybe because there's three of you and you're all married. I don't know. I'd call that crowded. I don't know where I fit into all this. So I'm leaving. Enjoy your multiple blenders and your weed whackers and whatever else you polygamists do. Wait, wait, Cassie wait up. Oh, you're not my daughter. And who might you be? - I'm um... - Oh my. Those shorts are very short. Sweetheart. Sweetheart. Mom. As soon as we heard we just had to come. Yeah they ambushed me. Hi. I made a brisket. They wouldn't let me bring it on the plane. I'm so happy for you. I gotta get a drink. Go and get the wedding ring. Mines still on. Its stuck. Go get the pictures, the wedding pictures. So how do you know my daughter? Oh she's my personal trainer. I'm doing a triathlon. Wait, it doesn't fit me. Its sized for you. I'm sorry. Hey, Cassie, could you go hide the presents? What was that, dear?

You know right now is really not a good time so you should just. Looks like a party to me. Hey, hey Oscar, its great to see you. Uh hey, a few of my family just dropping by unexpectedly. Hey, mom, they dessert forks are in the top drawer. Oh how sweet. Already calling you mom. I thought you didn't have any family. Oh hi, Sheila Rothman. Oh hi. Alejandra must have a bigger family than I thought. Are you Mexican, too? Of course not, sweetheart, I'm Jewish. Oh he's so cute. Yeah, you know we should really go hang out by the pool or something. Now do you, you like to salsa? I took ballroom dancing last year. Come on, let's show them how its done. And of course the Martins came over, uninvited, as usual, carrying our mail. Stan Rothman, father of the bride. bride? In this place? You got to be kidding. Oh I put eight ounces of Viagra in the guacamole. Always get a party going. Max, no, no stop! Don't let the Martins anywhere near my family and keep everybody away from this guacamole. There's enough Viagra in here to kill my grandpa. Ben, wait. Checks right here. The Martin's had it. Just stop eating that, just stop. Should we open it? No, no let's wait for Ally. I love that Cassie. You think maybe she's thinking about moving in? Not that I know of. So I'm a little confused. Who'd you say got married? Julie and her husband Pablo. The whole family came in for a little reunion and celebration, baby shower. - How nice. - oh my goodness! - Oh my goodness. - Get up there. No, no. Isn't that sweet? Max, stop. Oh, oh my goodness. What an affectionate dog you have dear. No, no. Oh, oh. Oh dear. - Oh my goodness. - I'm so sorry. Let me help you up. Oh that's okay, dear. Are you mad? I don't like lying. I just want to make it right with you. Okay. I gotta go. Okay. You know I am having a pretty good time. Yeah much more relaxed than my first wedding. Sandy, where do I put the suitcases? How are you holding up? I'd rate this as probably the worst day of my life. Sweetheart. I forgot to tell you. We couldn't get a reservation until tomorrow. So we're all staying here tonight. And it just got worse. You don't mind, do you dear? No no of course not. The more family the better. We won't be any bother. And where do you live now, sweetheart? Uh I actually just moved out. Very recently. In fact, will you excuse me for a second? Suddenly I had to move out to cover for Mel's story line. So uh, so my room is now the guest room? I'm sorry. They never stayed. Could you just please stay at Cassie's one night, please? I'll try to catch her. Cassie. Night then, dear. I'm not used to seeing you like this. Jesus I am so awake. Maybe we should wait till Ally gets here. No, I don't think I can sleep. I'm too jumpy. Open it, open it. Ally will be fine. Damn I left my audition pages in Mel's room. You mean Mel's and Ben's room. Right. Mind giving me a minute? Sure. Yeah, oh yeah baby. Yes! Oh this money is gonna change our lives. Mel, I would marry you again any day. How much guacamole did you have? What? Nevermind. Ow. What was that? You pig! As I walked into the room, I couldn't believe what I saw. My Mexican heritage let them have it. Viagra guacamole or not, they were both just jerks. 10 years of friendship. I want an annulment. Is everything okay? Oh honey. When I left that night, our bond was broken. I felt the worse I'd ever felt in my entire life. Plus it was the second time Ben had done this to me. She never wants to see me again. I've never anybody say that to me before. I have. Much worse in fact. Damn Viagra guacamole. After what happened in college, Ally's never gonna forgive me. And as for my best friend Mel, I can't even talk about how much that hurt. Sorry to disturb but in the midst of the family orgy last night I forgot my audition pages. So. Ally we need to talk. We were drunk and excited about the money. Well of course you were excited. Isn't that just the way it has to be between best friends who have sex while their stupid roommate moves out to cover for you? How could you? Ally, please, I'm sorry. No you know what? You are so full of shit. Both of you. Look, first of all. I didn't tell Cassie a thing, all right. She figured things out on her own and second I'm moving out. I'm staying at Steven's until I can find a place of my own. Yoo hoo, sweetheart. We have bagels, lox, and coffee. All we need is you. Bon appetit. You know you were roommates first. I'll move out. Maybe then Ally will come back. We really messed up, Mel. That was it. Were broken up.

Starting to forgot about dreams for our band and hopes for our music. You can stay with me as long as you want to. But maybe talk to Mel before you sign a lease? Okay. Give me a second. So I finally called Mel back. She said she had something to tell me, in person. Hey, Mel. I got your message. I'm so so sorry. No, no, no. I over reacted. No you had absolutely every right. And then I got an even bigger surprise. There he was. Guess Mel surprised us both. Mister wonderful. So I asked you guys to come here because I really wanted to tell you something in person. With the trust money I finished the demo and the label loved it. They want to do a full album with us and they offered us a huge advance. Really? That's amazing. So with the trust money I wanted to give it back, since we don't need it anymore. You guys okay with that? - Yeah, yeah of course. - Totally. Ally, they loved your voice and Ben your songs. The songs are from all of us. The other thing I wanted to tell you was since we're gonna have all of this money left over from the advance, I put in a really low ball offer to my uncle to buy this house and with the economy the way it is he accepted. When I lost you guys, I actually realized how much you mean to me. And then Mel asked us to finish the record. I can't do it alone, you know? For real this time. Is that a yes? Yes, yes. Come here. Are you guys gonna move back in? Because that would make me really really happy. Of course. But I mean I can only speak for myself. So. Yeah, yeah no we'll make it work this time. So that was it. I forgave them. There was a lot more at stake than a drunken hookup. It was time to get serious. Put this behind us and make a hit record. The label was bringing in a big time producer from London. Everyone was nervous. Especially me. Hey, Bob. Its, Ben. Oh sorry. Ben. The roadies are unpacking the better gear. You won't mind giving them a hand, would ya? Uh, no problem, you're the producer. Yes, I am. Listen up everybody. We have got lots of work to do. So lets get cracking. Hello, treacle. - How you doing? - He's such a prick. Well the label thinks he a god. He produced seven multi platinum records. Is that me? We all got down to making some serious music. Ben got a promotion and more deadlines than ever. So he was kind of missing out on being in the studio with us and hearing the songs that he wrote come to life. That was beautiful. May I? Please. Cassie and I were in the same boat. We were both betrayed. She took off an a yoga retreat and I was writing music nonstop. Mostly about love and broken hearts. No one knew they were really all about Ben. ♪ Lies and kisses ♪ Burning ♪ Like December ♪ Freezing in the nights ♪ That we remember ♪ Time pulls on my heartstrings ♪ ♪ Take me under ♪ Me under ♪ Wash away regrets ♪ Of tragic lovers What do you guys think?

And its a beautiful thing and I really don't want to give up on us. I really want to make this work. I miss you. I miss you, too. Talk soon. All right, bye. So Cassie and I are talking again. Good. I'm so scared of messing this up. Well just be honest and try to get her back. That's the plan. You guys are so cute. Sorry. Hey which one of you guys called Cassie? Well whoever it was, thank you. That evening, it was our last day of recording. Things in the studio weren't going very well. You okay? Why did the label people have to come today? All right, here we go everyone. Last track.

Brilliant, I tell you. I cannot wait to record a solo album with her. You'll be involved in some way, of course. Hey, Bob. You know when you lay down the track. Can you put a little more bass in there, yeah? Cause the highs are starting to feel a little high. Yeah its Ben and I'm not the tech. Uh yeah, sorry, roger that. Ben. Um, I'll get my guys on it. Uh, Kenny. Ben. What? Gentlemen, look. You were magnificent. Thank you, it was nerve racking. Well get used to it. Hey listen, there's party tonight down in Malibu and one of my A&R guys is from London so I thought you and I could go down, say a few hellos. Well I'm uh, I'm sorry. I uh. I don't think I can go. Uh. Well yeah listen, babe. Its business. The head of the labels gonna be there. Okay, business. I'll pick you up at eight. All right guys, lets get down to some serious drinking. Gentlemen, lets get some champagne down our necks. Just admit it. You're still mad about what happened in college. As if I care. That was six years, two and half months, and three days ago, Tuesday. See I'll never live that down. Why should you? You were a jerk. Oh boy here we go. With you and Mel there were circumstances but in college, you were just a jerk. Come on, Ally. So what's going on with Nigel then? What are you talking about? Well did you sleep with him? Its none of your goddamn business who I sleep with. Uh yes it is. We're married. Only when it suits you. Oh we need to put the past behind us. Come on, be reasonable. I am a woman. I don't have to be reasonable and that's why you love us. Are you in love with Nigel? He's such a prick. Nigel actually cares about me. Oh Nigel has known you for three weeks and he cares about one thing and you know exactly what that is. I have cared about you for years. You're the one who fell in love with that frat guy in like two seconds after we broke up. That was to make you jealous. Is that what's going on with Nigel? Quiet. Quiet, everybody, its gonna happen. Its gonna happen now. He is not good enough for you. No one is. According to you. Things are finally starting to look up for me and I thought you'd be happy for me. I am happy for you. You deserve all of it. Come on, Ben. We both know we'll never know how to be serious. I think I'm losing you. I've never been more serious in my life. We may be a little different but we're a family. Okay nobody can deny that. And we love each other. You hurt me. I know I know and I want to make it up to you for the rest of my life. Marry me. No I mean it. No marry me for real this time. I can't, I can't imagine one day in my life without out in the same room, in the same bed. You, me, Mel, Cassie, all of us. Marry me. Is that a yes? Yes, yes, say yes! You're crazy. Come here. I love you. Yes. Yes? Yes! Don't touch me. Okay awesome, Ben. I think this calls for a celebration. So just like that, we all became the big happy, messy family I always wanted. Cassie sent a Mel a plane ticket. They were really back together. Maybe our dreams will come true. At least we're having a great life while trying. So Ben and I reconfirmed our vows with our family and neighbors. We all got down to making some serious music. Cassie moved in. Max finally has a playmate. I know we're a little different but no matter what anyone else says I wouldn't trade these guys for anything. This is family.
