Thank you for your support. - Thank you. - Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. - Thank you. - Thank you. Thank you. Yes, about 2,200,000 have been collected. Thanks to you all, we managed to do it. Yes. No, that's not an issue. I will send it to headquarters first thing in the morning. Yes. Thank you very much. Thanks. Father, are you okay drinking that much? Today is a special day. It’s okay. I will get it. Money Stop! Father! That’s the citizens’ money. Please stop! That’s the citizens’ money. Please stop! Please! Please stop! I beg you! Stop! Squad 3! Squad 3! This is HQ! Please respond! This is Squad 3. There was a robbery at Hikawa Church in Yamato-cho. Please investigate the location. Roger. Squad 3 is moving to Hikawa Church in Yamato-cho. - I am Harada from Sagami Police. - Officer! Please arrest the robbers. - Any loss? - The amount of 2,200,000. - That’s all they took? - Yes. I think so. I passed out due to their beating. I see. How did they look like? Outfits? It was too dark to clearly identify them. Did the robbers assault your daughter? There was nothing like that. Nothing… Stop this madness! - Where is Hasegawa? - I don’t know! - You should contact him right now! - What? Now, it’s time to sing with your beautiful voice! Mother! - Where did he go? - Hey, good work. We have to catch up with our performance score in the public security sector. Otherwise, the Central Police will complain about us. And, apparently, we have another case too. Harada! Actually, there was some trouble today. There was a fire at Sagami Mental Hospital in the suburbs. Nakamura is the suspect. How is Nakamura? Eight people burned to death, but we couldn’t find Nakamura among them. And there were two dead nurses who, supposedly, were beaten to death. The estimated time of death is five hours before the fire. Of course, we can't be certain that it was Nakamura. But Nakamura ran away. How has he been doing with his illness? Not much different in terms of amnesia. The other thing? You know? It’s been treated, mostly. - Chief? His illness… - Idiot! It’s not a joke! Nakamura fools everyone. He's no pervert or weirdo! That’s all Nakamura’s act in order to run away from us! Kill him! - There is no other way! - No! That’s our last option! Only if he escapes from the cordoned area and his illness is clearly found to be fake. Also, if we have to do it, we should make it look like legal self-defense. Harada! Kato and you should work on this case full-time. - Oh, Mr. Harada? - Hello. Please come in. Please. I will make some tea. Nakamura ran away from the mental hospital and is currently missing. There was a fire of unknown origin. Eight patients burned to death. Nakamura was not among the dead bodies. Where did my husband go? If we knew that, we'd have it easy. First… Nakamura is charged with arson and murder. It’s just a possibility. We have cordoned off our jurisdiction. We have no lead at the moment. Have you had any contact with Nakamura? No. I don’t suspect you. Just in case, please let us search your place. Shit! - No one? - Yeah. Hello? Hello! What? This is Nakamura. Hello? Hello? Who are you? Hello? Hello? Idiot! Why didn’t you let her take the call? My bad. I didn’t think. Did you hear anything? Nothing? That’s right... I heard a signal. I think it was from a train. Everyone! Please show kind support to orphans from car accidents! Please provide your support! Please provide your support! - What time is it? - It’s still okay. Please provide your support. Please show warm support to orphans from car accidents! - Sorry. Sorry. - Everybody is here. The event will start at 9. The first game will start at 10. And we will start at about 11. Is that alright? Got it. Thank you. Please give your support. Please give your support. The reason whe went crazy is you, the police. What do you mean by that, Ma’am? Do you really believe that he is crazy? You deserve this. What are you doing? Please stop! Stop! Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! Please stop! Stop! Let me go! Stop! - Let me go! - Stop it! Go home! Ma’am? Get it! Hello? Yes. This is Nakamura. Wait a second please. It’s your chief. - Yes. This is Harada. - There was a murder at Sagami Station. What? At a public toilet. The victim is a young girl. Thank you for your service. She died not long ago. On Track 3, a local train for Ohara via Hayano is about to depart. It will depart when the bell rings. If you need to ride, please hurry. - Please take care of this too. - The luggage should be on the shelf. - I will do it. - Are you sure? Of course! Look! - Let’s do our best tomorrow. - Yes! I can do it. Because there will be no other chance. Hey! Look for him! There! There he is! Get on! Get on! This guy was crying earlier. Did you see him? Seems he is very tired. What a weirdo. He started crying as soon as sat down. And he's snoring now! Oh, there it is! Why was he crying? He visited a woman with high hopes but… No way! Perhaps dirt in his eyes? Stop resisting... Stop resisting... Stop resisting? Fire… Fire! Fire! - Want some chocolate? - Yes. We’ve crossed the border. - I'll be back in a minute. - Okay. What? Nothing. Where are you headed? Where to? Nowhere specific… Are you feeling sick? No. It’s hot. Hey! We can make it! Mr. Nakamura! I want to become an officer! I want to become strong! And then… Shit! Harada! Becoming strong and powerful means becoming a perpetrator. I don’t care how. I hate being a loser! You! You! - What are you doing to the girl? - No, that’s not it. I felt bad today so I wanted him to treat me. I'm telling the truth! Are you fine with this? Fresh-faced school girls sure are very brave these days… What? What’s wrong? A robber! There he is! A lunchbox? Idiot! Shit! This is no good! You shouldn't use a gun like that. Chief! - What is this? You are blocking us! - What is the hostage’s name and age? Mariko Shimizu, 17, 2nd grader at Seiran School. - What does he want? - I want to know that myself. - Any findings in the cordoned area? - Nothing. How will you investigate this case? - There'll be a public announcement soon. Please wait. - We can’t write an article with that! It doesn’t work! You're still young though. This is because you drink too much. Shut up. This is your job! Do something. Hello. This is Kato. The girl’s name is Mariko Shimizu. She's 17. Okuzawa Police hasn’t found anything in the cordoned area. They'll contact us as soon as they find something. Just tell me the important part! Is he sane or insane? I think he is sane. Listen! If he is really crazy, just let him be! Okuzawa Police will take care of it. However, if he is sane, we can't afford to let him live. Understood? - I know! - What is Harada doing? Right now he's... Listen. Don’t forget that you are not in our jurisdiction. Feel free to contact me. Understood? Yes, sir. It’s okay. I knew from the beginning that it was a toy. - You worried? - About what? You, me, everything. My friends are okay. This is not my first time. I’ve run away four times. I was taken back home on my first 3 attempts. One time, I voluntarily went bac home because I felt lonely. But this is my first time I ran away with another person. Do you think I am a bad girl? No, I don’t think you are a bad girl. Okay. I'm glad. My name is Mariko Shimizu. What’s yours? Well… I don't quite remember... They called me No. 19. No. 19? I don’t remember anything prior to that. Poor thing. I'm hungry. Wait here. I'll go buy some food. I have 3,000 yen. I'm okay. I'll be back soon. Next is Nickname Manbo. Wow, what chickenscratch! It’s hard to read but I have to. Yo, what’s the plan now? I’ve been thinking about it while looking at my left eye filled with purple color… Mister! It feels good in here. Come here! Mister! Come here! - How do I look? - Huh? How do I look? - You mean on the train earlier? - Yeah… Like a pervert! Extremely dirty! Anyway, what day is it today? Thursday. That’s right. It’s Thursday. I don’t have time for this! I am surprised. Green Pig is happy about the new discovery. Please put on the song I requested. - My cousin will contact me. - I'm worried that you might not have the LP. If you have a lot of money, don’t request a song! Buy an LP! Don’t be stupid. It’s from Narashinozonbei. Next is Hi, Green Pig, I have another request. After leaving my parents’ house, I joined a small troupe. We are traveling around in a Daihatsu. When earnings are low, money and food are low as well. We are trying really hard but being an actor isn't easy, Green Pig! - Hey! Still at it? - Wait a minute! Eat properly at least! People said I'd give up after 3 days. It's very challenging. That’s enough. Focus on this! Stop bugging me! One time, while we were on stage, I got an erection. It was totally unexpected. Why'd it happen, Green Pig? Tell me! Tell you? How would I know? Getting an erection on stage... If I were you, I'd be embarrassed too. Anyway, keep going. What about today? I would like to introduce my troupe. First of all, there's a guy we call Sea Monster. We are promoting something similar to communism. Even a newcomer can call anyone Sea Monster. He's such a weirdo and always wears women's clothes. He's like a hard-boiled egg with a touch of attitude. I'd like to make more introductions but id'd take forever. So I'll end the introductions here and announce our troupe’s schedule. Our show will be in the Komatsugahara Theater from the 23rd to 30th. Especially, I would like to deliver this message to my cousin, Mariko. She must be in another prefecture at the moment with her classmates. - Mariko! Are you listening? - I'm listening! I'm listening! My wife’s name is also Mariko, though. Whatever. Just forget the trivial facts. Please come visit us! You too, Green Pig! You only have to pay 100 yen instead of the regular 200 yen admission fee. I will be waiting for you. From Funky Jump, the great newbie actor. The letter ends here. Did you hear, Mariko? The Komatsugahara Theater is a bit too far away for me to go, though. Please go there if you can. The requested song is It Always Rains in the End. - Hey! We're leaving! - Huh? - We'll arrest Nakamura and the girl now. - Huh?! - Hurry up! - Okay. Stop that! Get dressed! The Komatsugahara Theater isn't far from here on foot. Let’s walk there until morning. - You'll have to lead, though. - Yay! I like you, Mister! Let’s listen to Vanishing Street. Mister! I'm scared. I'm scared. This way. Mister! Hurry up! No, do it properly! Let’s go! Yes, this way! Put it there. - Do you know Funky? - Huh? Funky! Funky! Hi! Hi! Mariko! Mariko! You finally came! Come on, this way. Hurry up! Pretend that you sprained your ankle. - Great! - So cool! Excuse me. This guy sprained his ankle after slipping. Can we take a rest here? How unfortunate. Hey, bring me the first aid kit. Please come. Make yourselves comfortable. Everyone, let’s take a break. Let’s go over there. - Honey! - It’s not the time yet. We have to care about the kid too. - I'm hungry. - I want a big bowl! I want a big bowl of miso soup. - Everyone, ready? - Yeah! - Okay then. Thanks to the farmers! - Thank you for the meal! He is… looking right through me. Bastard, when are you going to stop your act? - One more bowl. - Yes. Can we do it now? What are we waiting for? Let’s hurry! Leave it to me. If we fail, the local cops will be all over us. - Pick up the pickles. - Goat meat is... Some help here? Listen. Nakamura is not alone anymore. Have you already started eating? How pathetic. That’s not fair. First, we have to decide if he is sane or insane. And he has a gun. Are you sure that you can kill Nakamura with one shot? He was the best shooter at our station. Would you like to come and eat with us? - Come! Come! - Thank you. - Come? Come? - She's calling you! I'm already full. - Is the beef finished? - Not quite. So, are you two newly-weds? Yeah, very recently. Very recently? Doesn't look very recent to me! Awkward… Are you two very recent as well? Yeah, very recent. Right? Mr. Number 19! Are you accepting it? Mariko, you slut! How can you get a new boyfriend without telling me a thing? So that's their story. The tea is getting an erection. The tea is getting an erection? Who says a thing like that? The tea is getting an erection... Who is stirring the tea right now? - Are you sleepy? - I guess… Well...is it really okay that we stay here? Please do. It might not be the best kind of accomodation, though. An audience is always welcome. - That’s right. - Let’s go. You, Shinshu Bastard! Do you have coins? I have two coins. If you don’t have any 10-yen coins, the call will end after 3 minutes. Stop making long calls. End the call now! Delivery here. This is Shinshu Cooked Sardine. Thank you for the order. Shinshu! Shinshu! D Don’t come near my soba noodles! You will just get the leftovers! Drink water instead. That was delicious. Miss! One more bowl, please. - Delivery is here. - That’s interesting. One more bowl. - Delivery is here. - One more bowl. Harada! Becoming strong and powerful means becoming a perpetrator. - One more bowl. - Delivery is here. - How exciting! - Here. Here. Here. Here. Thank you. Honey! Follow the officers’ orders! Shit! You made a mistake, you bastard! I'll rip you to pieces! Who are you? Who are you?! Let me go! No! Let me go! Honey! Honey! Please stop this! Don’t move! Look closely! That's your wife! Your name is Keiichi Nakamura. You're 31 years old. You're a former inspector from Sagami Police! It hurts! Stop it, please! No! Stop it! Honey! Let me go! Stop it! Stop it! Don’t do it! Don’t shoot! No! Nakamura! Don’t do it! Stop it! We are Officers Harada and Kato from Sagami Police. This man committed arson and murder. Can anyone call 110 for us? - Were you scared? - Did you expect to be rescued? - Why didn’t you run away? - Was he violent to you? - Please say something. - We can't write if you don't talk! Can't you speak? See you. Say something, please. Officer! You… are… ...pitiful.
