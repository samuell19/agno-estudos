All right, Dawn, we'll begin with you. My mom works in a doctor's office looking at where babies come out. Shh: Why don't you tell us what you see as your career goals. I want to be a baker and bake donuts. All right, who's next? Joseph? Um... I guess... a singer... Like, um... Johnny Ray. He's a... whatta ya call? A crooner. He's real good with the ladies. My mom collects all of his records. Ever since she was little. She almost met him one time. All right, Alice... Why don't you tell Joe what the directions were, please? We were supposed to tell what our parents do for a career. And then what we wanted to do. That's what, dummy. Um-hm, thank you very much, Alice. Jog'!? My mom works at the rug mill. And where does your father work? He's a banker. Joe... why don't you just tell us what your father's job is, so that we can move on, okay? He's... a singer. Joseph! A spaceman. Joseph! He's a magician. Tell us! He's dead. All right, you know what? I've had just about enough of this, all right? He's a cleaning man. What? I couldn't hear you. Say it louder so the whole class can hear. He's the janitor. Where? Where does he work? And speak up. Here at school. He cleans out all the toilets. Ow...! Silence! You will never touch another child in my classroom again! When I tell you to do something, I expect you to do it. You're just like your father. Bob...? God. Bob? Where are the lights? I want the lights kept on at all times. What are you doing? Are you drinking down here again? No, Ann. I'm telling you... if I catch you drinking, or find another bottle in this office, you'll be out of here so fast. Do you hear me? Yes, Ann. No excuses, no talksmnothing. You'll be out. Yes, Ann... I want the sink in my bathroom repaired today. And that's another thing. I'm not some broad you just picked up. You refer to me as Ms. Williams. You understand? Yes. You smell nice, Ann. Put out that cigarette. Ho-de-do. And then I would smack her fat ass again. Smack, smackm! Shut up, Ray- She really pulled down your pants? In front of everybody? That's what I'd have done. I'd have smacked that fat ass. I mean, she should have just been smacked! The-gosh! That was just terrible. You can't stay out of trouble, can you? Where the hell you going? Sit back down. What are we supposed to eat with? Our hands? Go get the goddamn silverware. Did she tell your father? I dunno. She deserved it, Mom. Hey, go wash your hands, they're filthy. Where's the note? What the hell is wrong with you? Are you that goddamn stupid? Huh? They were saying stuff about Dad. Let them say whatever they want. Ignore 'em, for Christsakes. Next time they're going to put you in Central Tech School with those crazy, retarded kids. Is that where you want to end up? I didn't even do anything. Shhh... So now you're hittin' people? Okay. Let's eat now. No, I'm talkin' to your stupid son. I asked you a question. So, now you're hittin' little girls with pencils? It was the eraser end. You listen to me. If I hear crap like that again from one of your teachers... I'm gonna knock your fuckin' head off, you hear me? - I didn't even hurt her. - It's my job! I work there! Do you hear me? Okay. 0 Kay? Hey, get in. For what? - Get in. - What for? I told Mom... If you make me get out of this car, I'm gonna knock your fuckin' head off. I told Mom I was gonna stop at the store... Never mind that. Get in the car. What, Dad? I need you to pick something up. From who? Jerry. I gotta work for that guy. Get in this goddamn car. You owe him like a thousand dollars... Why don't you do your own fuckin' dirty work? Get in this car! What? Buzz off! You're twenty minutes late. Go cut some squash, and then... check out the freezer. Ya hear me? And then go out and check the bar. And while you're in the bathroom... put some toilet paper in there. You do it... it's your jerk-off room. I'll jerk your head off! Give me three salads with this. What it is, little man? What it is? Did you get something to eat? Oh, just some Ho-Ho's. Hts-Ho's'! Get a sandwich. Tell Roy to get you a sandwich, man. It's all right. I'll just pick on this. I wouldn't be touchin' that if you saw the leper who was drooling all over that shit. Hey, Roy, you old fuck! What? Get the boy a sandwich before he gets hepatitis! What you talkin' about, hepatitis? Get him a fuckin' sandwich, man. No hepatitis around here. Here, go upstairs to my apartment... and get me some change. Where are the lemons? In your pants. I'll take a grilled cheese, Popeye. You'll take squirrel. Grilled cheese on rye... you old fuck. Fuck! Hey, Jerri!" there's a little man at the door. What the hell do you want? Oh, Christ. Doesn't she know I'm busy up here? She knows I'm busy up here. Is that a midget? She really doesn't give a shit. She can't leave me alone, can she? She can't leave me alone. Take it, take it, take it. Get out. Oh, and by the way... You tell your old man I'm tired of waiting. Enough is enough, I want my goddamn money. Get out. Go, go, go, go, go... Mike...? Yeah? I saw Allyson. She's here? - Yeah, I saw her here. - Where? She's with Jim Darcey and them. See ya. What... he likes her now? Oh, I dunno. I hate her. Hate all them rich girls. Me, tom-rich bitches. She got nice titties, though. She does have nice titties. Yeah, I know. You look nice. Thanks. Hey' What do you want? Where's Ray? He's over there... We're gonna play foosball. What are you wearing, aftershave? No. My mom cooked sausage. Maybe that's it. What kind of sausage? Summer sausage. - I love summer sausage. - Oh, yeah. Get out of here. Who is that? Uh, that was my little brother. Joe. How old is he? He's, uh... a year younger than me. He's so scrawny. And his clothes... What? He looks like a little hobo. Our washel-'s busted. Can I talk to her? Which one you like? The short one. She's pretty cute... she in eighth or ninth? They held her back twice. She's like 18. I dunno, maybe 17. I thought we were gonna play some foosball. These fuckers are never gonna let us play. They will. Come on. She does have splendid titties. Did you get a haircut? Yeah, I got a little trim. Looks a little uneven. My mom cut it wrong. You got a cigarette? You can't smoke over here. Aw, let 'em arrest me. Let's dance. Look at this fuckin' asshole. I know. Come on, there's foxes. What's he doing? - Disco Dancing? - I guess so... he looks like some kind of herky-jerky fish. He looks like a puppet. A puppet on a string. Looks like he has palsy. Let's get the fuck out of here. I can't stand to look at this. Let's go. I wish I could've met you... in a year or two... Oh, maybe then you could've seen in me... what I saw in you. On the day we met... you were still tryin' to forget someone... you used to know. And there just wasn't enough time... between her goodbye... and my hello. Boy, we tried for awhile... . Hey- . Hey- Get rid of that cigarette. What do you want? How are you getting home?

Don't wise off, I'll throw your ass out the window. Fuck off-everybody just fuck off. What happened? The old man went nuts. What? He broke all her records. Just threw them at the walls, one by one... smashin' 'em over his knee and shit. All of them? Just about. He asked her for cash... she said she didn't have any. He started goin' through her purse, all of a sudden... he started screamin' at her and calling her a whore. He called her that? I couldn't believe it. Then what? He started smackin' her around. He found rubbers. What? In her purse. Where is she? In the kitchen. I can't believe he broke all her records. Come on with me. How is it? Good. They put a lotta whipped cream on it this time. Want some? You be a good boy, Joe. Sorry about your records, Ma. Late pass. Fuck! Next time you are late, you're expelled. And today you report to Mr. Coles during your study hall period. You got it? Overslepb-gimme a break. Are you...? You must be Joe... Joe Henry. Joseph Henry. Yeah. All right, great. I'm your guidance counselor... I'm Len Odes. You can ca“ me Len... or Coles, or Mr. Coles. Are you related to Jack Coles? Yeah... he's my uncle. I see the resemblance. My old man used to work for him at Prescott School for a while. That's funny... So. I'm supposed to talk to you about this whole tardiness... "One-Eyed Jack." What? That's what my old man used to call him. Huh. On account he was hit in the eye playing fast pitch... Had to wear a patch over his eye, looked like a pirate. Real nice fella, Jack... Yeah, he was. Hey, if you ever see him, tell him Joe the King says "hello". He'll get it. He's dead. This whole tardiness thing, I mean... it's a lot of tardiness. Yeah, I mean, 54 times? You know, maybe you should try to get to bed a little sooner. Well... you got any work you can do? Some homework or something? All right... I got some-here. This is good. Take a look... look at this, all right? I'll be back in a few minutes. All right. These look like gold. Lemme see.

I got the Nancy Wilson, the Billy Eckstine... the Joe Williams and the Chuck Jackson. I have two of the Brook Bentons- the other three I have at home. A lot of the Johnny Ray stuff is... kinda hard to find, you know. It depends on how much you got to spend. Money's no object. Now you're speaking my language. Could I bum a smoke? I'll see you in a few days. Joe, Joe-. - Did you see Mike? - No, why? - Orzo's lookin' for him. - The hare-lip's lookin' for him. - Is he gonna fight him? - Where is he? - Upstairs in the room, cleanin'. - Aw, shit! You don't fuck with the hare-lip. Mike's been runnin' from the hare-lip all week. I ain't afraid of that big, dumb, fuckin' hare-lip bastard. Fuck you. He'll have you screamin' like a little girl. You're a fuckin' idiot. Hey"- You ain't gonna fight that fuckin' guy, are ya? Maybe you should go talk to him and tell him you're sorry. Yeah... "I'm sorry." Are you a fuckin' idiot? Come on, Mike, let's just go home. It's just stupid. You can't beat him. Stop talkin' about it, okay?! I'm goin' to fight this fuckin' guy, like it or not. I've known this guy since I was 6 years old. What kind of cruel shit is that? Standing there with a fuckin' mop and pail, makin' $2.25 an hour, and you want me to say, "I'm sorry"? I won't say I'm sorry. I'm not gonna come. Please-let's just go home! I try to tell you something... Shut up! Oh, no. I was running back. I got nothing to say to you. I was running back...!

Why don't you buy me some new ones? You're the big man, you're the workin' man... Yeah, you know what I make? Why don't you tell me about it, big man, workin' man? You don't wanna know. How much you take in tonight? Let me see your wallet. Come here. Why, you wanna borrow some? Are you through? Come on... You finished? Every time I turn the corner, it's, "When's your old man gonna pay?" "Tell your old man I better get my money." Brazer, Jerry, and everyone else. You owe 'em, so pay 'em, and get 'em off my back. You don't tell me... I tell you. Get yourself some shoes. You look like a bum. Get me a drink. Seagram's and a Coke. this toilet...? Who broke the toilet? That's very nice, very nice. Looks nice.

Jokes, huh? What you oughta be doin' is studying for themmregents. The math regents? Fuck math. That's a nice attitude. Very nice. Someday you're gonna have to balance a checkbook, y'know?

You come in here every day... you don't have a book... you look like a bum. What are you gonna do with your life, huh? Read your jokes. Hey, you wanna ride home? Nah, I'm not done yet. Fuck it, man. The bitch is gone with her husband for the weekend. 'Oh yeah? - Yup. Where'd they go? Where it is that stupid, ugly, white people go for the weekend. Hey, no offense, okay?

I'm gonna tell you why. First, you're lucky that I was spending quality time with some respectable types, including my parole officer. What are you talking about? What the fuck... Don't jive me, man. Secondly, you're lucky the old man had enough Seagram's in him so he didn't die when he fell down the steps. Number three... You're lucky I don't bust you and turn you in... for breaking and entering, you hear me? I don't know what you're talkin' about... Go home and shut the fuck up, all right? The lady don't want to see you without workin' papers... so get the hell out of here, all right? Do they know it was me? They think it's Mary's ex-husband, so don't worry about it. They asked the old man... he thought it was a big rat. He thought that you looked like a big fucking rat. What the fuck you laughin' at, stupid? Hey"- I didn't meant to get you in no trouble. Don't sweat it. Be cool, all right? Just be cool, man. Len... - Lenny...? - Uh-huh. What does "pithy" mean? How do you spell it? P-I- ... T-H... What's wrong with your leg, man?

It was a test and they called my name over the loudspeaker... kinda takes a guy by surprisemwhoo! Well, that was me. I wanted to... talk to you about your friend... Joe Henry? You're friends with him, right? - I don't know. - You don't know? Can I have one of those? Do you have any idea how he hurt himself? I've been having trouble contacting his folks. You're asking the wrong guy. Thought you two were tight. Might have cut it off. \'I\'\ sorry? Might have cut off the phone. Maybe that's it. Look, you're barking up the wrong tree here. (Odes-q Raymond... I'm just a little concerned. He might have hurt himself at work. At work? At the restaurant. You didn't hear it from me. What restaurant? Mmm, I don't know... Schautz'.

Hang “P- Hello... hello. What can I do for you? Do you employ Joe Henry in your kitchen? I do, but he's not working no more, we're cutting back... Hang up'. Goddamn“! I knew I was gonna get screwed by that little cocksucker. Will you shut up! Shut up-shut up! I did not know he was 14 years old. Nobody told me that. Well, I'm telling you now, all right? And I haven't contacted his parents, but when I do... I'm sure they're gonna be very upset. Like I said, I don't know nothing about the kid's leg or nothing. - All right. - Yes, sir... yes. And I hope he doesn't work there anymore, if he does... the next call you'll be hearing from is the police. - You understand? - Yes. Can I just ask you something? He cut his leg... - and there was a lot of blood. - I don't care if he cut his leg! It was a lot of blood, a severe gash. - You're feeling sorry for him now? - Yes, thank you. Bye. - Who you callin'? - The cops. It was the kid. Mike, it's Joe. Is Mom home? What do you want? Just thought I'd let her know I'm on my way home. She's at work, then she's goin' out.

Wh-who is it? Open the door. Police! Joe Henry? Get your clothes on. You're coming with us. Let's go. Look, buddy, there's still no answer at your house. No idea where she is, huh? It's 2:00 in the morning. I'll keep trying. In the meantime, I'm gonna bring a cot in here rather than put you in the cell, okay? Okay. I don't know what to do. His father isn't around half the time. I work all day, I can't keep an eye on him 24 hours. I can't. Well... what do you suggest I do with him? It looks like the best thing I can do for you... is to send you to the Jamesville Juvenile Detention Center... for the term of six months... to one year. I will allow you one day... to put your affairs in order with your family... after which, you will report here at 5:00 p.m. Any questions? I guess there's no school for me today, huh? Where you goin'? I'm goin' to school, Ma. Where the hell is your father? Why do I have to do this alone? We have to have him here at 5:00. I'll come home right after school. You okay? Yeah... yeah, I'm fine. No school today, eh? I quit. Here you go. Apple pie... strawberry shake... french fries... cheeseburger... onion rings... mashed potatoes. That's a lot of food. Yes. Okay. I brought you a little extra gravy for your mashed potatoes. Can I have the check? You done? Yeah, I'm done. Is that him? Is that him? Where were you? Where the hell were you? Oh... God. Joe...? Christ, Joe, you know where I have to take you in less than an hour? Look at me. Yes, I know. I put some stuff in that bag for you. So you're gonna do some time. Stevie Wonder couhfa seen that cumin'. Keep your nose clean... don't talk to nobody. You hear me? How's your mother? What? How's your mother taking the news? Not good, I guess. How long you gotta do? They say six months if I stay outta trouble. Six months for stealing. What did you need the money for? Christ, I could'a got you the money. What the fuck ya need money for? You're 13 fuckin' years old. 14. You're not gonna see 15 at this rate. Scared? A little. How many times I tell ya about the stealin', Joe? How many times did I tell ya about the stealin'? I better get back. I guess I'm not much to give advice... No, I guess not. "No, I guess not." But I think about you and your brother a lot. What I'm saying is... there's people who do good, Joey... they have family, job... I had a job. Swept floors, made a livin'... I had a pension coming.

"He told me he was very lonesome... and no one cared if he lived or died. And said, 'Sometimes, the thunder and lightning... make all the little clouds hide.' He said, 'Have faith in all kinds of weather... for the sun will always shine. Do your best, and always remember... the dark clouds pass with time.' He asked me if I'd tell all my world... just how hard those little clouds try. That's how I know I'll always remember... the little white cloud... that sat right down... and cried."
