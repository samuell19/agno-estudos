(fanfare music) (light-hearted music) (speaking foreign language) Ah come in, everybody speaks the English here, (speaking foreign language), is the only nightclub in Paris, the City of Light, where in 1918 you can forget all four bloody years of war, (speaking foreign language). (air raid siren wailing) (airplane engines rumbling) (anti-aircraft guns booming) (people chattering) (singing in foreign language) (patrons applauding) Compton! Oh my Lord. I say, look here. I say, don't do that old chap. I have just come down from the line and my nerves aren't as strong as they used to be. What? (speaking foreign language) He offers me a place! Well! You've just arrived? About an hour ago. How long have you got. Oh 10 days. 240 hours of life. Well ladies, here's a furnished heart to lit, for seven days! (laughing) Hey don't worry, Mr. Captain. You will find plenty to take it for a week! (laughing) (cheerful music) (applauding) Ah, that's the girl for me! (singing in foreign language) (applauding and cheering) Oh, Mademoiselle, pardon! (speaking foreign language) Mademoiselle, now that you've died for France, come and live just a little for England! (speaking foreign language) Oh please, please take pity on two poor lonely soldiers. Oh, very well, if that would make you happy. Oh, it will make me very happy, come along dear. David, our new commanding officer. Well, a jolly good song and jolly well sung. I sing it that way because I feel it. Oh, don't get sentimental over this rotten war. I do not understand you, monsieur? [David] It's bad enough without singing about it. But the music gives you the heart. The courage to fight the enemy, to conquer. It's the songs about war make wars possible. If they told the truth about it, what a, what a fucking thing it is instead of glorifying it, nobody'd ever start one. That is not the way I see it. You wouldn't. Oh come on, calamity! Don't spoil the party. Here's to our most dangerous enemies, they're always with us. (laughing) (lively music) (cheering and chattering) (patrons singing wordlessly) [Man] Time was the wise are fast asleep in bed. Don't forget your promise, go straight home. [Man] What else can I do? [David] You left us very suddenly, Mademoiselle. Wasn't the British Army good enough company for you? That was because of you. Ah, that. I shouldn't have talked like that to a pretty girl like you. You know you're perfectly adorable when you're angry. If, um, if you would invite me to come up there, I'll make you forgive me in half a jiffy. May I come up? You, you're afraid to come down here because you know you'll forgive me. Would I? You don't dare! You dared me to come down here. Now make me forgive you. Well, there are six rules for making a girl forgive you. The first rule is sit down beside her. Oh, very well. And the second rule is to take her hand in yours. You weren't very nice to me tonight. Now look here, I'm awfully sorry for what I said, but those girls and the whole atmosphere of that place. Oh, those girls have their place. They serve their country, Monsieur. They laugh and sing and love, so that their men forget the war. All right. You help me forget the war. I laugh and sing, if that will help you forget. Comrade! Now look, but what do you know about the war anyway? I know a lot about the war. My brother and father gave their lives for France. (water hissing) Say you'll forgive me? I couldn't really be cross with a soldier. Here, cheer up, I'll sing the song myself. How does it go? (singing in foreign language) (laughing) I can't sing the damn thing. And now, look here, if I called you tomorrow, will you come and have lunch with me. Ooh! I say, you're being drowned. You will have lunch with me? Maybe. Wake up my dear, the English officer is here to see you. What? The English officer is here to see you. Oh Flory! Quick quick, tell him I will be there in one moment. I have but why so excited? Three days ago, you said you hated him. No, that was three years ago. You mean three days ago. You're losing your head. Oh quick, my jacket. Oh, I am so happy. I'm in love for the first time in my life. I know these English officers. They come to Paris for a few days and then they go away. Where is this jacket of yours. Well, you are an English women, Florence, and you stay here. It's different with me, Paris has always been my home. But him, what I said was right. And I say you are not. If he goes away, he will come back again to me. (David humming) - Oh! - Hello, darling. So how is my sweetheart this morning? Oh, I feel... Like that! (laughing) And how do you feel this morning, my David? I feel... Like that. Tell me, what where you and Florence arguing about? She said such horrid things about you soldiers. She said you love for a while, and then you go away, and forget. Oh, I have to go back, Lola. We all have to go back. But soon, soon it'll be peace and we'll have each other always. (speaking foreign language) Do you have to go back to that hell? Not hell, with the memory of angel to keep you company. Foolish one, I am no angel. Just a girl. And a good cook. Lola, do you realize you know nothing at all about me? I just know you are my David. When we're married you won't have to cook. Marry? Marry? We'll dear I, I thought you might... Oh, oh you thought I might? Then you will? Oh, Monsieur! Oh, darling. Now now listen, darling, I've only two more days of leave left, we'll have to hurry. How soon could you be ready? Oh, so sweet, as quickly as! Now listen, darling, I'll make all arangements, and in hour I'll be back for you! [Lola] Then it is true? The truest word you ever heard. In an hour you'll be my wife. Oh, David. When it's done we'll get a car and we'll drive through the woods, and we'll have our wedding breakfast at that little, that little cafe at (mumbling). Yes! Will you hurry, darling? - Au revoir. - Au revior. Florence, Florence! Trouble? Oh, worse than trouble. In one hour we marry! (speaking foreign language) Could you direct me to the English Church? English, uh, (speaking foreign language). No, let me see if I can make you understand me. The church... (speaking in foreign language) I'm really not following. Look, I want, ah, you know. (hums wedding march) You know, get married, the church. (speaking foreign language) Alright, nevermind, thank you very much. Can you tell me the way to the English Church, sir? Church, no time for church. Everyone has to return to the line. Oh, but that doesn't count for me sir, I've got a week's leave. As a matter of fact, I'm going to be married. Oh, I see. Well, I'm awfully sorry, young man. All leave's been canceled. Everyone has to return immediately. But sir, my fiance is waiting for me. It's no use arguing, that's the order. Oh, but can't I, can't I have one more day? You can't have one more minute. Everyone has to return to the line. I want you all to report to the RTO in the Gare du Nord. Come along. (melancholy music) (speaking in foreign language) Why you stand there like a ghost? Why don't you go and bring him back to me? But (speaking in foreign language), Monsieur Defoe has already gone to look for him. It's not so easy to find an officer in Paris. Oh, if anything has happened to my David it will kill me. Don't, my dear. In these days, we've got to take the blows the good God sends. You know something! What is it? Lola, I know nothing. (knocking on door) Oh, David! (speaking in foreign language) (Lola crying) Dear, what does he say? He say, wait for me. (Lola crying) And, I will wait. (knocking on wood) (guns banging) Hey there, show leg! Stand to! Sounds like drill, Sergeant. Your mother duck. All present and correct, sir. Keep a sharp lookout, I don't like this stillness. Very good, sir. (explosions booming) [Man] Stretcher bearers, on the double! [Man] Stretcher bearers, on the double! Well, doctor, if he does remember me, he'll remember his business. I'm his partner in the Halford Construction Company. Yes, then if he remembers his pre-war life, it will be a step towards complete recovery. Hello, David. Hello, Charles. What brings you here? I've come to fetch you home. So, how's everything. The war doubled our output, and now it's over, the country's got to build. We should be busier than ever. The war. They're always talking about the war. Don't worry about that. You're going home fit. If you can't remember the war, so much the better for you. And I hope for your sake, you never will. Goodbye. Goodbye Doctor, and thanks for all your kindness. I'm just going to say goodbye to the staff. Alright. Well, Doctor. He recognized you at once. He remembers all about the business. I should say if he would take up his life where he left it at the beginning of the war, and that all that has happened during those four years will probably seem an absolute blank to him. Goodbye. (machinery rumbling) Let's see, Charles, this is the fifth annual balance sheet since the war. Yes, and we show an increase every year. To improve on these figures, we shall have to extend shop number two. Well, we have to do that anyway, to carry out the (mumbling) contract. What's the good of it all, Charles? I get no kick out of things. I have everything a man could ask for. A big business, money, a beautiful home. And a beautiful wife, David. [Vesta] Hello. You're rather late, aren't you? I'm sorry. But I've so much to do that I'll never catch up with it. Well, let's go to dinner. I'm not dining at home. But I'll take a cocktail with you. Thanks. Vesta, you know I hardly ever see you these days. My dear, we had a good look at each other at breakfast, didn't we? No, seriously, we, I never get a chance to talk to you. Oh, David, you're so old fashioned. It's sweet of you to want to chat with me, but the fact is I've been so busy. There was that (mumbling) I got up, and Lady Mary's bazaar, and now this charity ball to do. My dear, you know what I mean. We are leading entirely separate lives. Now, David, don't be melodramatic. Besides, they're all good works, and I have Deloryse to dance at my charity ball. She's the sweetest thing that ever came from Paris. You'll love her. Cheer up. I know, you go to the theater and see Deloryse. There's a box there in my name, and I'll join you after my meeting. But there's still... Darling, I must fly. I'll look you up after my meeting. Dinner is served. (car horn honking) (car horn croaking) (peaceful music) (rain pattering) # Raindrops ever falling # Falling in my heart # Seem to whisper secrets # When it's to time to part # Now I'm cold as raindrops # Never cease to fall # Raindrops know that lovers # Smile the best of all # You are like a flower # Smiling after rain # You're a lovely flower # Bringing joy again # Oh, how much I need you # Loved you from the start # Don't know what I'd do without you # Sunshine of my heart (audience applauding) She has great charm. She certainly has. (baton clicking) (peaceful music) # Raindrops ever falling # Falling in my heart You see, Sir Vincent? Hmm. Angina. Fancy dancing with a heart like that. # Raindrops never cease to fall # Raindrops know that lovers # Smile the best of all # You are like a flower # Smiling after rain # You're a lovely flower # Bringing joy again # Oh, how much I need you # Loved you from the start # Don't know what I'd do without you # Sunshine of my heart (audience applauding) David is here! David is here! He's out in front, he's... Lola, dear, I want to talk with you. Dr. Garvey, I haven't one minute. [Man] (mumbling) Hurry up you girls! I think I'll go have a cigarette. Oh, stay and see Deloryce's other number. (lively music) # To you, I shall always be true # So I'm leaving # Don't be grieving # To you, I must whisper adieu # Don't be weary # Don't be teary # And though I know that it's hard to part # Keep my memory in your heart # And pray for that wonderful day # For the day when I'll come back to you (audience applauding) Lola! (dramatic music) Attendant. Will you take this note to Madame Deloryse, please? I'll wait here for the answer. It's very urgent. Florence, my blue Georgette. [Florence] Yes, dear. No, the pink one. [Florence] Yes, dear. Florence, my silver necklace. [Florence] Yes, dear. (doorbell ringing) Oh, he's here. Dr. Garvey, Madame. Good Garvey. I had Sir Vincent Harcourt at the theater tonight to see you after you'd gone through the strain of a performance. But you ran away. But I didn't ask you to bring him. I don't care for his opinion. Well, you paid 25 guineas for it. Yes, and I'm 100 guineas better off for not hearing it. Garvey, I have great news for you. Yes, my David is coming. Your David? Yes. When? Tonight. Any moment, perhaps. Now my child, you must not get so terribly excited. I'm not exited, Garvey, I'm delirious. Yes, yes. But you must keep cool, keep cool. Keep cool. You English would keep cool in hell. We must. We have quite a large colony there. (Lola laughing) I realize, Lola, what this means to you. You couldn't. No one could. Why think, at any moment the door may fly open and I shall be in his arms. Let me feel your pulse. What a man. You talk of nothing but your miserable profession. Now, do use some common sense, Lola. When one collapses as you did... But use some common sense yourself, Garvey. When a woman waits for years for the man she loves and suddenly he comes back again is it not too much. My dear, I'm going to talk to you very very seriously. Nature has hoisted the danger signal. You can't afford to go on like this. You must give up your work. But I can't, Garvey. I don't want to. Then, my dear, it is my duty to warn you that the strain might be too much. What do you mean. I mean that I can't let you dance again. Oh, but I must. I must, Garvey. I can't give it up. My child, if you dance even once more, you're taking a risk, a tremendous risk. I once told you that someday you might have to give up the stage. Well, that day has come, and sooner than I expected. I am going to die? I won't say that. If you will live in the country somewhere quietly. You promise me that? It all depends upon my David's plans. Oh, you'll do whatever you like with David, as you do with all of us. But you must cancel your professional engagements. Don't tell my David. I understand. Goodnight, Lola. Goodnight, Garvey. (doorbell ringing) David! Oh, oh! (Lola crying) Now, now, come. There's nothing to cry about. I thought I would never see you again. No, now you must be sensible, dear. When you keep your head hidden, I can't see what you look like. And I want to look at you. Oh, my darling, what happened to you. I thought you were dead, or perhaps you didn't love me after all. When they canceled my leave so suddenly and sent me away, my one thought was of you. At the start of the big attack I was badly wounded. And months after when I recovered, my memory had gone. Oh. Everything was a complete blank, the war, and you. Oh. When I saw you tonight on the stage you were a stranger to me. Until I heard that song, then it all came back to me. And your love for me, that has come back too, David. Now tell me, have I changed? Mmm. Older, eh? Older, and so serious. There's a far greater change in you. The little Lola I knew has grown into a beautiful woman, and a famous one. Oh, David, it seems a lifetime since I waited in my little room. Then your note came. You were gone, and I cried all day. And all night. And the next day too, I cried all day. But that's all past. Let's not think about it. Don't you want me to tell you? Of course I do, but it's your great success, I can't get used to it. My success. That means nothing. There is something, something else really wonderful. I have the honor to present your son. Oh, but Lola. Shh. You are pleased? I always say to myself, he must be a real Englishman like his father. Sometimes I come home tired and miserable, but I look into his eyes and see you there. You want him, David? Your son? Want him? It's been the one great dream of my life. Well, now you're happy. You can smile. David, why don't you smile? Ah, now you are my old David of Paris. Oh, those divine days, they were dream days. Do you remember the day we had lunch at Sans Germelle. And that night in the gardens of Versailles. And the day I tried to talk French and you laughed so that I kept calling the coachman a pig. (Lola laughing) And our days in London will be just as wonderful. In Paris we were to be married. And now we can be married. Married. Oh, I know what you're thinking. You don't want to be the husband of Deloryse the dancer. Foolish one, after we're married I'll give up the stage. I promise I will. No, it isn't that, isn't that. Is it that you don't love me anymore, David? No, it's not that, Lola. It's... What? That I'm already married. Oh. (plodding piano music) Hello. I didn't expect to see you until dinner time. Aren't you feeling well? Oh, yes. Then what's happened? (plodding piano music) Vesta, I want to talk to you. Oh? I'm sorry, but I can't put it off. Well, if you can't, you can't. What is it? You know it's been a source of great unhappiness to me that you don't want children. Surely there's no need to discuss that again. I'm afraid there is. A son is the one thing in life that I want. Oh, we've spoken of this so often, is it necessary? Vesta, I want to adopt a boy. Adopt a boy. You mean that seriously? Very seriously. I should not dream of such a thing. (plodding piano music) Besides, what do you know of the boy's parents? Why, they might be anything. He might even be the son of a criminal. I can set your mind at rest as to his parentage. Well, I'm not in the least interested in the boy. Perhaps you will be when I tell you that he's my own son. Your son? Oh David, how could you? How could you? Now, don't misunderstand. This all happened long ago. Long before I met you. It was in Paris during the war, just before I was wounded. I see, and now she's in London, and you saw her and conveniently remembered her. It was the shock of seeing her again that brought back my memory. You see, we loved each other, very dearly. Very well, David. Whatever you decide to do, I will never agree to divorce you. I'm not going to ask for pity from my friends. It still remains, first, to settle the boy's future. That remains for you to settle. I will have nothing to do with it. Please don't decide too hastily. I'm trying to show you every consideration in consulting you. You pride yourself on being a liberal-minded woman. I beg you to be big enough to help me. I will not have the boy in this house. Vesta, why? My answer is no, a thousand times no. Very well, if I can't have my boy in this house, I'll have him in another. David, what are you going to do? (plodding piano music) Ahem. Madame Deloryse to see you, Madame. Oh, it's about the final arrangements for the ball tonight. Say that I will be down immediately, Mason. Very good, Madame. Well, Deloryse, how charming of you to come. Why won't you sit down? My dear, you look terribly worried. Don't tell me you're going to disappoint me tonight. Why, the whole success of the ball depends on you. It is not that, Madame. Then perhaps it's something I can do. I would like to help you. You would? [Vesta] Anything I can possibly do. It is something that concerns you. It's about your husband's son. Oh? But what are you talking about? I came here today to ask you to take him into your home. Well how does this concern you? What do you know about my husband's son? I am his mother. You? Impossible. And you have the insolence to come here and tell me that? Madame, I beg you. Please, I'd rather not discuss it. Listen to me, I entreat you. Think what you like of me, that doesn't matter. Think only of your husband and his son's future. Won't you try to understand? I understand perfectly. It doesn't suit the great Deloryce to have a big boy tacked onto her. Madame, the artist is dead. It's the mother who pleads with you now for the sake of her son's happiness. I won't discuss it. The whole thing is revolting to me. Oh, but Madame. What right have you to come here? It was you who asked me to come this morning. Very well, well now I ask you to go. But you must listen to me. It was in Paris. It was the war. We were to have been married, then suddenly he was recalled. He asked me wait for him, and I've waited. Then I gave up all hope, I thought he'd been killed. Those years of pain melted away when I saw him again last night. At first I couldn't believe my eyes. I thought I had seen a ghost. Then he came to see me and told me of you, and I realized how hopeless everything is. But the boy will need his father. I come here to beg you to take something I'd give my life to keep. You rang, Madame? I've done all I could. Mason, show the lady out. Vesta told me of your visit. I'm terribly sorry. Why did you go? Because I thought it might be easier for a woman to make her understand. Lola, dear, I know what thought you've been through. I've been through it too. And it's brought me to a decision. It's Vesta's attitude, her lack of human feeling, that's decided me to do what I know is right. We'll bring up the boy together and take the consequences. Oh, but David, love is a great thing. I do not care for anything. It's good to see you again, sir. Thank you, Florence. Did you have a nice walk in the park? Yes. Well take off your coat and give it to Flory. Don't be afraid, darling, go and kiss Daddy. There. Well, old man, what have you got to say to me? It's my birthday tomorrow. By Jove, is it? Yes. Well, we'll have a great time together. I would like a lot of nice presents. Did you bring me one? Well, of course. We'll go out and you shall choose just whatever you like. I like the thing we saw in the shop window. [David] It's yours. Mom says that it costs an awful, awful, awful lot of money. Well, you shall have it, though. Tell me, what is it? A high tower. What is it? The Eiffel Tower, he means. I see. Well, what do you do? Do you wind it up? No, you build it up. That's the fun. So, building's fun for you, eh? Rather. That's my work. I'm an engineer. Perhaps Davey will be an engineer like his father, huh? Yes, and we'll begin tonight. We'll leave London together. But David, where do we go? To Paris. Paris? Look here, if you hurry I think we can catch the night bird. Oh, I am ready this moment. I'll go just as I am! No, you've time to dress and pack while I go and get my things. There. Oh, think David, and we'll have those wonderful days again, just as before. Alright, Sweetheart, don't lose your head. It's the train I will not lose. Hurry, hurry, David. I shan't dream until I'm in the train. Now darling, I shan't have time to come up. Will you be ready to jump in the car just as soon as I get back? Yes. I shall be waiting on the doorstep with Davey. Come Davey, run. Flory, we go to Paris tonight! Flory, we go to Paris tonight! [Florence] And me too? No, no, you stay here and arrange everything. Get out my trunk, quick! Didn't I tell you he would do what was best for me and the boy? There will be trouble. Oh, you're a calamity. You talk to much, go! Oh! Hello, Nanny. Hello, darling. Hello, Nanny. Hello, darling. How are you feeling today, Nanny? (doorbell ringing) Mrs. Halford, Madame. Mrs. Halford. Say I'm sorry. Say I'm going away. [Anna] That's what I told the lady, but she said to me, tell madame it would be a great misfortune if she didn't see me before she left London. Misfortune? Show Mrs. Halford in, Anna. Mrs. Halford, Madame. Madame, I'm sorry you gave yourself the trouble of coming here. There's nothing more to be said. Oh, yes there is. This matter must be settled satisfactorily. For you? For both of us? Perhaps. When men have an affair to settle, they come together man to man. Now I've left my pride at home, and I come to you without prejudice to talk to you as woman to woman. This morning you asked me to take your child into his father's home. And you refused. And now I agree. And now I refuse. Madame, your husband has decided. It is finished. He is going away with you? Oh, Madame, I beg you, give your husband his freedom. No. You must take the consequences of your action. Oh. You will get used to the snubs of decent society when they find out about you, and the never-ending moves from place to place. What do I care for society? Do you think I care for anything in this world but my son and the man I love? You're planning to bring us all unhappiness. My husband, your child, me, and you too. Do you realize what this would mean to him? Do you realize what his position would be, A man with business friends in the outside world? And do you know what the final result would be? He'd begin to hate you, you the cause of it all. But my boy, his future. Do you think you're helping him? In the eyes of the world he would be your son, not David's. What are you going to say to him when he grows older and begins to ask questions? Mommy! Mommy! Yes, Dear. Won't you come to me, little boy? His name is David. David? Won't you come to me, David? Are you cross with her? No, darling, no. Well, aren't you? No, Davey. My father is buying me a big Eiffel Tower as high as this. You are a lucky boy. Now that I've seen him, I understand still less how you can bring yourself to take such a risk with that adorable child. Risk? I'm taking no risk. You must know the terrible name that people will brand him with. And they shall not. They could not. Only you and I can prevent that. If I'm willing to do my part, how can you refuse to do yours? [David] Be sure you call Mr. Dennison the first thing in the morning and tell him to send all my mail on to the Crillon will you? [Butler] Crillon, sir? Yes, set those in a small bag. Oh, here's some more things here. Have a care. And let him know I'll get in touch with him in the next couple of days and tell him all the other instructions. Have John come up and take this down to the car. Sound your horn, Wilson. (car horn honking) I want my doggie. Alright, darling, run and get your dog. Darling, why aren't you ready? We shall miss the plane. I'm not going. Why? What's wrong, what's happened? Your wife has been here. She's promised to take care of Davey. She asked you to bring him to her tonight. But what are you saying? Lola, what are you talking about? You can't mean this. Life gives us only moments. I'll have my dreams. No, Lola. Shh. Mommy, I have my doggie. Are we going away? Yes Dear, you're going away with Daddy. Mommy, I'm sleepy. Oh. You'll soon be in bed now, my angel. That's a sweet little darling. Mama's baby. I can't face it. Shh. I know what this means to you. He's very sleepy, my little boy. # That I can't explain # You remind me of a rosebud # Smiling through the rain # When I hold you near me # All my cares depart # Don't know what I'd do without you # Sunshine of my heart May I put this in the car for you. She loves him. Everybody loves him. Lola, Lola. Shh, he's asleep. Flory, get some blankets and make a bed for him. Take the backseat, his father won't mind. David, be very careful he doesn't fall off the seat. Ask the chauffeur to drive slowly. You must take great care. I can't go. We must find another way, a better way. There is no other way for me. Darling, don't you understand it's you I want. I love you. You're the only thing in the world to me. I can't live without you now. Forget everything else. I could never forget what your wife said. Woman to woman, we pledged our word so that our boy could hold his head up like any man. Your wife is keeping her word, David. You ask me to break mine. Oh, Lola. Do you want to do a great thing for me? Anything. Then don't say anymore, just goodbye. Take him, quick. David! (Lola crying) (car engine rumbling) Goodbye, my Love, my life. (Lola sobbing) Oh, my baby. Flory! Flory! Get my dance frock. Oh, you can't! You must not! Do as I say. [Davey] Mommy. Oh. Oh. [Davey] Mommy. Oh. [Davey] Mommy. [Mason] Lord and Lady Ness. (cheerful orchestra music) (Mason's announcing drowned out by music) My dear, you must not do it. If you won't listen to me, I'll go and tell... No, you stay here and wait for me. Mommy. Mommy. Please dear God. Doctor, I'm a wealthy man. Isn't there anything I can do? You can't buy her a new heart. Is there something wrong with Lola? She's at your house to dance for the charity. You must stop her, I could not. Quickly Mr. Halford, she must not do this. (rhythmic exotic music) I want my mommy. I want my mommy. I want my mommy. Mommy. (lively exotic music) (bell tolling) (melancholy music) (audience applauding) (peaceful music) Why did you do it? David.
