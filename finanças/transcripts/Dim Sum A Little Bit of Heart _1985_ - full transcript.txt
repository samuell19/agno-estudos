- Hm? Hm. - It's so nice outside. You shouldn't stay indoor all the time. - How do you know? - Hey, Geraldine, you want some of this? - No thanks. - I bought it at the new store down the street. - Okay. Get some later. - Oh. Okay. Okay. Oh. - That's it. - You get it. Up and away. It's rolling to Brown at third base, who picks it up. No throw. Everybody safe. The bases are loaded for Pedro Guerrero. That was a shot that hit Riley. Guerrero loses third, sacks to second. Carry out a scene out at the Giants dug out. So too is Danny Ozark. Wanting to check on Riley who is in play. But uh, Riley's gonna stay in and he's gonna face Guerrero. With the bases loaded and two out. - Oh, Geraldine over there, huh? She's helping me modernize the place. Taking out all the records. Even Iron Butterfly. - Hey, that's my favorite. - Oh, me too. - What about her and her uh, doctor friend? They married yet? - No, you know he's still got that good practice down in LA. She's living with her mother out in the avenue, you know. She's real Chinese, you know? - Yeah. You know what they say? You can take a girl out of Chinatown, but you can't take Chinatown out of a girl, eh? - Hey mom. - Hi. - Did you take your pills? - Yeah. - This is the best baby. - Ooh. - Thank you. - Wow. Oh yeah, oh yeah. - Okay. - Oh, I brought some lucky money, too. One for everyone. - Oh. - Eliza. - Ooh. - And mommy. - Thank you. - Linda. And Kevin. - Oh, we still get one too, huh? Can you afford this? - Yeah, Uncle, you are a stingy one. - Yep, there's a quarter in mine! Ooh. - Actually, he doesn't have to give us anything. He's not married. - Oh. - Aw. - Okay. - Yeah, yeah. - Yeah, let's eat. - Looks good. - Look at this stuff, though. At least dad used to cook a ham. Oh. Kevin. - Everybody eats two bowl of rice. Two. - That's right. Eliza, you have to eat two bowls of rice, okay? - Eliza, you have to every grain of your rice. If you don't, you'll marry someone with a smallpox face. Who is that? - Bye. Goodbye. - Yeah, we'll go now. We have a long drive home. - Yeah. Okay, bye. - Bye-bye. Bye. - Oh, yeah, Uncle's birthday. We'll see what we can do about it, okay? - Yeah. All right. - Hey, ready to go? - Yeah, yeah. - Come on, we gotta get the show on the road. - Thank you, thank you. - No, no. I go back to the bar to blow firecracker and scare away the evil spirits. - Okay. - So Kevin's gonna take me home. - All right. - Woo hoo hoo. You gonna come with me now? Ah! Oh, you better stay with your mom. All right. Take care. - Oh, mom, her hair is not messy. It's curly. Just like fat choy, huh? Yeah. Well we better go. We gotta get you to dance class. Happy new year. - Even if they want to get married, they don't want to give a banquet. - It's such a bad feeling to argue in a new year. - Everybody is busy. Everybody has important things to do. - Oh, we did okay. - I thought we made more last month. - Hm. - Oh. Geraldine. So... You must be tired after a long day. - I went to the travel agency. - Oh? China tour. - This is a good tour. - You're having your finals then, aren't you? Your orals? Your mother's just like those old people in Chinatown. Thinks she has to go to China to pay her last respects. - She showed me her jewelry again. - She's not going to show it to me again. Gives me the willies. - This year she even has Polaroids. - You're kidding. - Ooh. Here's a good tour. Look. And I can go with you then, see? - You've been here 40 years, now you have to hurry to become an American citizen? Mom, you don't have to do that to go back to China. - No. I go back, I want to be American. - They're going to ask you in English. - Yeah. I study all day. - Okay. Who was the first president of the United States? - What? - The first president of the United States. Who was he? - What? - Ma, that's the easiest one. Okay. Very good. - Here. You take it in, mom. - No, I don't wanna take it in. They're going to ask me the same old thing. When are you going to get married? Where are you? Let's play. - Ah. Oh. Congratulations. - Yes, this is a congratulations cake to mom. - When we eat your cake? Huh, Geraldine? - Well, don't you like this cake? - No Geraldine. We want your wedding cake. The one that smells so good and make your mama so happy. - Well, would you like me to cut this cake now? - No, no, not now. We haven't finished our game. - Okay. I'm just going to leave it on the table. Good luck everyone. Thank you. - All boys, all girls. You can't force them on anything. They even get married at their own pace. Everything is freedom, freedom, freedom. I won, give me my money! - Let's push these piles a little faster, ladies. And turn 'em over. Oh my god, no potato chips in the game! Get that out of there! Hey, I like them Venetian blinds you got on there, girl. - You're the one who gave them to me! - Back to business! Let's play or eat. - Let's eat. - Let's eat. - Where are you guys going to dinner tonight? - Some place where Max can eat a lot. - So you like Max better than Henry? - Well, look at it this way: Max is not Chinese. Chinese men are too. Yeah. You know, dead wood, dead bored. - Dead head. - Dead head. You know, Chinese men are real dead woods when they're married to Chinese women. All they care about is their sons and which movies to Betamax. - Well go tell mom and Auntie Mary. Hi Auntie Mary. - Hello. I made some Chiuchow Fun today. - No, I can't. It's time for Dynasty. Geraldine, I just told your mom Mimi and her boyfriend have decided to get married right after the new year. It's going to be the leap year next year. It's a good time for marriages. It's the best. - Well, that's good. So what is it now? 12 down and three to go? - Ah. I have six married children out of my house, and that's enough. I have been a good mother. They're going to move to New York. They're going to buy a $200.000 condo. One bedroom. Oh, kids have a lot of money these days. - But I don't drink. I have a closet full of presents like that. - Well, it's time to see what Alexis is up to. - Ah, don't worry. I'll get it tomorrow. Actually your mom should see Dynasty, too. It's a lot of fun. It's just like the Chinese soap opera. Sex, love and money. The house seems do big when the children are married and gone. It's too big for me now. - Auntie Mary, you have a daughter that lives around the corner and another one that lives just two blocks away. - Oh sure, so they can come over faster when I start to die. Ah! I hate those bugs. Thank you, Geraldine. You are good girl. You are the best Chinese daughter to take such good care of your mother. Goodnight. - Night. You know, mom took out those two dresses from Hong Kong the other day. The white one for my wedding and that brown one she wants to be buried in. - It's so morbid. Mom talking about the house and going to China to pay her last respects. - Yeah. - She's preparing herself to die. - Definitely wasn't a good way to start the new year. But you know why she's doing it, though? She's going to be 62 this year. - Yeah. The fortune teller. - That's when he predicted that she was going to die. - Oh. - Oh. Thank you. What a surprise. Wow. My favorite kind. What's this? This look like the bottle I gave to George for Christmas. See? By the secret marking on the label. Where did you get this? - Oh, no, no! I told you, this is my favorite. - Yeah. 59-years-old. Next year, well, I have my grand celebration. Mm. Oh. I think you and me should get married. Huh? - This is gonna help Geraldine, too, to decide. Najima, if she know that someone gonna come and take care of you for the rest of your life. Hm? - No, no. - No, no, no, no, no, no. It will free her to get married with Richard and move down to LA. It'd be good for all of us. Najima, it's like a old Japanese movie where the widow parent pretend to, to get to remarried so the daughter won't have to keep sacrificing herself. Huh? - Ay! - Guess what, Uncle Tam? I saw the movie You Can't Take It With You last night with Jimmy Stewart. - Oh. What a wonderful movie that was. Yeah, it was pretty good. - Oh. - Gushy. What's so wonderful about it? - There was Lionel Barrymore, the father, and Jimmy Stewart. - Yeah, so? - Jean Arthur and- - There was a lot of people. - What a wonderful family it was. I mean, people who was laughing and hugging each other and loving each other? - You liked it? - Yeah, it's because we were in Chinatown. Life wasn't like that. It just opened my eyes. Like a duck, you know, when they peck out of the shell. The first thing they see they think's its mother. - Mm-hm. - My mother was the movies. Oh, but the older folks like your father, you know, they never went to the movies. They didn't know- - But they can't understand the language. - They just never went there, so when we went there, we just, you know, looked into the movies and the- - American culture for the people. - Oh, saw something for the first time. Should I blow it out? - Yeah, make a wish, make a wish. - Oh, make a wish? Okay. - Come on, hey. Blow 'em out. - Make a wish! I wish your mother weren't so Chinese. You know, we should get her drunk sometimes. - Mom's Chinese when she needs to be. She gets what she wants and she's not going to change much, either. - Those old Confucius ways don't work anymore, you know? Things can't stay the same. Something happens here, woosh, it changes. You can only keep what you can use. - Like what? - Food. Now, huh? Now that's worth keeping. Hm. - Oh, give me a drink, too. Okay, I'm coming. - Bye-bye. - Okay, goodbye. - Richard's been a part of our family for so long. When we get married, it'd be like incest. Our kids'll probably look like Prince Charles. - I see fived little cross-eyed kids sitting on their grandma's knee. - You know, I want a daughter. Are you serious? - Yeah. I like Richard. Hey. There he is. That's right. - Oh, hi, honey. Don't do that! Stop tickling me! Cut it out! - Okay, mommy. Ah. He's a little bit of dim sum. A little bit of heart for the both of you. You get the hint? - Mm. - Oh, you know what the name of this dim sum is? Huh? You know what that means? Several precious suns. - Several. - Being subtle, huh, ma? - You're lucky you have me here to decode for you, otherwise they won't get your message. So, when are you guys gonna get married? - When are you going to get married? - Yeah. When are you going to tie the knot? - Well, don't count me out. I have my eyes on someone. - You take the garbage out? - No. Not yet. - Well I'm going to bed. You can come up when mom's asleep. Let the kids be themselves, huh? - Oh. - She should have knocked before she came in. - Mm. - How long's it take to get to the airport this time in the morning? What? - 30 minutes. - Mm. - Hey mom. It was a nice weekend, wasn't it? - Oh, Geraldine. I was just getting rid of some of this old junk. What's new? - I just took Richard to the airport. Mom thinks she's gonna die. - Oh, that fortune teller business. - She's really pushing Richard and me to get married. - Oh. - You know, the thing that gets me is that she doesn't even care how I feel about this. You know, when dad died, I thought we'd become really close. - She's going to be lonely, you know, if you get married and move out. And she's been taught, you know, that she might have to suffer in life, so she accepts things as they are. Look at me. I'm a similar casualty. Don't get so upset. - I'm not upset. It's just that I'm afraid I'm gonna do it. I mean, if I don't get married and she dies on me, I'm going to have that with me for the rest of my life. A nice Jewish daughter. Oh, look at Inez. The one with a big cantaloupes. That was when we used to have dancers downstairs. - Dancers? - Yeah, long ago, your father and I. You know that was the only place that a Chinese man could look at a white woman. Dan-dan-dan-dan-dan. Dan-dan-dan. Oh my. A real public service. - Oh! Thanks. Thank you. - We'll see you later. - Thanks, bye. Turned out to be more like a family reunion, you know? My brother flew back from Canada, my sister came back from Paris. We haven't seen each other for years. It was nice. We sat around and we talked and we play cards and we ate and... - Wow, fun. - Then we figured that our mother wasn't going to die after all, so we left. My first American dream was to own a car and drive in it all the time. - Mm-hm? - Now I have a Mercedes. - Great car. - And one-fourth... No. One-eighth of a husband. An empty apartment. My reality is bigger than my dream. - Oh. Dream a new dream. - I can't even sleep at night. - Mm. You know, one of those days, I would like to have a red station wagon filled with kids. We'll sing songs and we'll go to countryside and we'll picnic. That's later. I have to get famous first with my rock and roll band. - Famous, huh? - Mm-hm. - Julia. - My mother died. She should have died when we were there. She was stubborn. She always did as she pleased. She was alone when she died. - Everyone seems so depressed up here. - It's just going to dad's grave. I can't believe it's been 15 years. - I'm not ready yet. - It's really hard, 'cause I don't know who's gonna take care of you. Kevin's married and he has his own family. And you know, Amy... I don't know about Amy, either. I mean, I don't want you to be alone. - Quiet, Uncle. I don't want mom to know I'm moving out all this stuff. Um, remember our date Saturday, mom. We're going to the movies. - Okay. - Your daughter loves you very much. It's good now that you let her do what she wants to do. You know, you realize you can't force her to marry? I always thought that your attitude toward her was inconsistent. - If you care about her, you know, you have to let her decide, to let her be. - I thought I saw Geraldine's car up front this morning. - I suppose she's fine? No problem, I suppose. - She will turn out okay. We are just. - Is this it? Okay. I'll write out checks for all the bills, okay? - Oh, good. Don't work too late tonight, mom. I'll see you tomorrow, okay? I'll lock the front door on the way out. - Mr. - Stu Fong, please call 255. Mother to daughter, mother to daughter, mother to daughter. Do you know how to make Chinese sausage? Mm-mm. - Come to your time, you don't know how to make it? No more Chinese sausage. Your favorite dish. - Good. - We're both back home, just like old times, huh, ma? - Yeah. - Ma? Ma? - Hm? - You want to go to China earlier? Is Uncle Tam going with you? Maybe. - I'm going to have 25 tables. Good morning. Canton is your final destination via Hong Kong? - Mm-hm. Mama has a specific way of cooking this for it to taste right, you know. - Oh yeah, sure. You know, I went to a demonstration one time, you know. with this cook from the Hong Kong. Boy, he was so good. I think it was at Victory Hall or something like that. And in no time he had... You know all this stuff. And uh... - Yeah? - And he had the audience come up and eat the stuff. And ooh ya-ya-ya-ya. - Are you ready for this? Ooh-hoo-hoo. - It's a disaster! What are we gonna do? I'm gonna learn how to make dim sum. - Yeah? - Yeah, they give classes at the YW now. I'm going to learn how to make the hardest one of them all. - Zhong? - Yeah. - You know, every year during Dragon Boat Festival, I used to think that I was going to learn how to make zhong. - Woo, good. - But then every year I didn't. - Why? - Because I thought that if I didn't learn how to do it then my mom would have to do it and then she couldn't die on me. - You know, I thought at one time that your mother and I were gonna get married. Did you know that? - Well, she wouldn't do it, though. She's old fashioned that way. - Hm. It's not like that in Florida. They're so far ahead, those senior citizens. - Uncle Tam? Don't be upset. We're similar casualties, remember? - I made you some soup. - Richard and I made some decisions while you were gone.
