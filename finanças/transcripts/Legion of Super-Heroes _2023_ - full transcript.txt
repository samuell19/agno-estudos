Hah. I'm still winning. I'd give up now because you are never going to beat... - You sure? - Hey! How's it feel to lose to your daughter? It's not over yet. Sorry, I can't hear you from first place. Isaid... Wait, what's that? Cheating! That's cheating. Can't hear you from first place. Ha-ha! General alura zor ei, high defender of Krypton, has lost! Park computer, activate bench. Yes! Kara zor ei, beloved daughter and crowd favorite has won! Park computer, water. Didn't anyone teach you not to gloat? I mean, the woman in charge of that lesson also cheats, so... Your form has gotten better. You've been practicing. Every morning. You're welcome to tag along. I'm a gracious winner. I could give you pointers. Believe me, if I could join you instead of dealing with the science council every morning, I would. And the guild and... I know, I know. You've got all ofargo city to oversee and no time to do it in. It's just... It'd be nice to see you more, you know? Hey. If it's important to you, then I'll make time. You come first. - Really? - Always, my Kara. Always. Besides, I'm not the only one about to be busy. Please tell me this isn't a ploy to get me to watch uncle jor El's new baby again. I swear, that kid puts everything in his mouth. I... is this... Does this mean my application to the guild's been... Accepted. Kara zor El, you have officially been assigned to the military guild. Welcome to the ranks, cadet. You've more than earned this. What is that? No! Not now. Come on! Computer, begin activation sequence, code "in-ze." - What's going on? - Jor El warned me this was coming. He told the science council that they had to act, but they wouldn't listen. They never listen! It's too late for Krypton, but not for argo city. I've been building hyper-sleep escape pods based off jor El's prototype. The council was against him, so I've had to do this in secret. It's why I've been gone so much. I just... I just thought we'd have more time to finish. We can get everybody out? Well, that's great, right? Activation failure. Activation failure. Activation failure. - Activation failure. - No! Work, damn you, work! I tried, jory... I just needed more time to finish them. Mom. I tried. Activation success. I am so proud of you. Every day, I am in awe of the strong, kind, wonderful person you've become. And I am so lucky to be your mother. Find your cousin and know that I will always love you, Kara. What are you doing? Mom! No, please! Mom, please don't do this! What are you doing? Mom! Okay. You can do this, Kara. Mall computer, map. Mall computer, map. Map! Map! How do you locate uniforms in the supply depot? Oh. Great. Yes, thanks. Mall, bring up... What a weirdo. Can you believe that? Talk about anger issues. What was that? Oh, no! Solomon grundy, born on a Monday! Destroyed Metropolis on a Tuesday! Killed Superman right now. Where are you, Superman? Grundy wants to play! You do know grundy and Monday don't rhyme, right? Also, I'm going to take you down. You're not Superman. I'm Supergirl. Remember the name, 'cause you're... You're no Superman. You're not anything, girlie! I'm fine, kal. We need to talk. Hey! No need to worry, citizen of Metropolis. - Solomon grundy has been... - My apartment building! It... you... Look what you've done! Uh, I saved it. You're welcome. You destroyed it! Just have your robot servants build you a better place. Or government-issued robots. Construction robots? Regular robots. Any robots? What kind of weird hellscape are you from? Krypton is... Was great. Not like your backwards planet. Backwards? Uh, you live in homes made out of aluminum and hot sand. Not anymore, thanks to you! - Your cousin is a problem. - You should be thanking me! - I just saved you! - You said we could trust her. We can. She's only been here a couple of months. She's doing her best. It's not good enough. What's that supposed to mean? You were so happy to meet someone alive from Krypton, you didn't stop to think about the consequences for the rest of us mere humans. In the short time she's been here, she's destroyed buildings and failed to control her powers. Worse, she doesn't care. With her abilities, that makes her a threat. I don't like what you're implying. Kara... Sorry, got held up in star city and didn't get the call until a second ago. Hey, where's Superman? Taking care of a problem. I'm more worried about this. Grundy was using it in his rampage. Wait, Solomon grundy? The guy who thinks grundy and Monday rhyme? There's no way he could build something this complex. You know, this is where I used to go whenever I had a bad day. I'd sit here as a kid and look at the stars, and... Little by little, my problems would just seem less ovennhelming. Were any of your problems, "Batman is kicking me off the planet?" Not exactly, but I'm pretty sure that's just because I didn't know him then. Kara, I can't imagine what you're going through. Having to adjust to a new planet, new powers, getting knocked off course, and arriving decades after you were supposed to. Finding out your baby cousin isn't so little anymore. All I'm asking is that you be more careful, and to give earth a chance. Kal, I'm trying. I swear. It's just all so primitive and weird and wrong and different here. I know it's not Krypton. But it could be home, if you let it. No, it can't! Krypton is my home. It doesn't matter that it's gone. It will always be my home. Kara, I know you're upset. You can't possibly know how I feel! Batman's right. I don't belong here. With Krypton gone, with mom gone... I don't belong anywhere. So, kick me out. I don't care. Or we could try something different. Trust me? Come on! Wait! Where are we going? Whoa. Where are we? Earth, in the 3ist century. Kara zor El, welcome to the legion of super-heroes. Please, take the badge. Just... You can get in. Just don't kill me. No guns. Why are you here? Who are you? The circle remains unbroken. Batman to any justice league members, there's been an attack at star labs. Do you copy? No. I don't know what they were after. Okay, new question. Uh, how are we in the 3ist century? Also, why? Also, what? We came here with the time bubble. It's extremely rare technology that allows travel between two fixed points in time and only those points in time. At least that's how saturn girl explained it to me. She's one of the founders of the legion of super heroes. Think of them as the future's justice league. They're a group of heroes who banded together to fight crime inspired by... Well, me. They contacted me through the time bubble after we formed the league. We've been in sporadic contact ever since. Which brings us to why we're here. They run a training program for potential new legionnaires. The legion academy. I thought, if you wanted, you could train here. It's not Krypton, but it's a little closer than earth of the 2ist century. I don't know, kal. If you want to go back, it's your decision. I'll support you either way. Superman. Kara? Oh, wow. It is so great to meet you. I'm mon El, one of the other trainees at legion academy. Mon El? Wait, you're Kryptonian? Daxamite, actually, from planet daxam. But I hope you don't mind me saying this. I love Krypton. That's why I changed my name. I've been a fan ever since I was a kid. The scientific wonders, the emphasis on conformity, order. The robots. The robots. Maybe not so much the kryptonite, but in every other way, Krypton was incredible. I know we've just met, but I really hope you decide to come train with us here at the academy. - Really? - Yep. - It seemed like you weren't sure. - I am now. We could still go back and train on the farm together. Nope. I'm good. Lift tractors? Bye, kal. Sorry, you can't stay. Want the tour? This is the legion academy. It's where our training takes place. The cube is the fight simulation room. It's also connected to the legion's holographic library... I'm sure you'll be able to find your way around. And that's pretty much the tour. Except the dorms... Girls are there, boys are there. And the window we use to sneak out after curfew is there. Noted. What's that one? That's the vault. It's where the legion keeps all the weapons they've taken from their enemies. It's protected by an insane security system, and it's never been broken into in the entire history of the legion. The system's on a hair trigger, and it's completely off-limits to us academy members. So, in other words, avoid the death lasers. - This is dawnstar. - Your roommate. Oh! I am so glad to meet someone else who can fly. We can pair up in training and practice cool power combos. Ooh, and team up for missions. Sorry. I'm all, "blah, hi, dawnstar." It's just nice to meet a new friend. Well, that's everything, except meeting the rest of the academy trainees and... Brainiac? He's got a weapon. Get back! Wait! I don't know how you survived the bullet, but I am not going to let you hurt anyone else. I don't know what you're talking about. But given your unhinged actions, I'm regarding you as a threat. Unhinged? You tried to kill Superman, my cousin. Believe me, if I had tried to kill Superman, I would have succeeded. I am the universe's only 12th-level intellect. I invented this force field using kinetic-reactive photonic energy. Which means, the more you punch it, the more solid it gets. Great. Thanks for the tip. Okay. That's it. Fight, fight... Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight. Stop! What the ever-loving hell is going on here? Reckless endangerment and damage to a classroom. What do you have to say for yourselves? He's brainiac. Why are we all just sitting here? As I attempted to tell you, I am not brainiac. You pulled a weapon on us. I was going to make repairs on the laser for a project and you jump to conclusions. Not surprising for a lesser mind. How is this not a villain? Kara, he's not brainiac. This is brainiac 5. Scientists on planet colu got their hands on the organic parts of the original brainiac cyborg and then used that to make him and his family. That is a gross oversimplification of the cloning process. - Anyhow... - Rna mutation alone has allowed me to surpass my clone siblings. Anyhow... He's a bright young man, and he's enrolled in legion academy, just like you. By "bright young man," she means I possess a 12th-level intelligence as measured by the scientific minds of col... Since we don't have time to sufficiently describe me, that will have to do. I've got some words to describe you. Unless those words are "genius," they're probably incorrect. Hey, knuckleheads, you're in trouble. The rest of the legion are off on a mission, leaving the three of us in charge, and you just made our jobs that much more difficult. We are truly disappointed. Since this is your first offense, we're letting you off with a warning. But in the future, try to act more like the heroes you wish to become. Dismissed. What is president saturn girl thinking, letting that kid in? Superman vouched for Supergirl. I'm talking about brainiac 5. Why is he here? Every single brainiac clone ever has gone evil. Brainiac 2 was an intergalactic assassin. Brainiac 3 tried to overthrow the united planets with mind control. Brainiac 4 is just a straight up serial killer. This is what they do. The brainiacs show up, attempt some evil plot, then disappear. It's only a matter of time before this kid does the same. Look, timber wolf, we agree with you, but we were outvoted. Were we? I haven't spoken to a single other legionnaire who voted to let him in. I think there's something fishy going on here. We've got bigger problems than your conspiracy theories right now. We still have no idea where the rest of the legion is. Last check-in, saturn girl and the others were on their way to deal with the terrorist attacks on planet durla. Then, suddenly, boom, radio silence. Oh. They're still not answering comms? They're not even showing up on the map. It's like they disappeared from the face of the universe. We've been having computer troubles over the past 24 hours. The issue could be on our end. We can't discount anything at this point. Shadow lass, chemical king, look into our system. It could just be bouncing boy pulling pranks with the comm arrays again. But if not, we need to be prepared. And above all, don't tell the academy kids. The less who know, the better. It has to be tonight. That was epic! Did they kick you out? Uh, she wouldn't be here if they did. Everyone, give her room. Kara, this is the rest of the legion academy. Seriously, that fight was nuts. I'm bouncing boy, planet earth. Ta-da! Now, if I said to you, I've got a bunch of naltorian frogs, would you be down to help me release them in the science lab? No -come on. It'd be great. Enchanté. Invisible kid, also from planet earth. Whoa! Can you turn other things invisible too? Yes. Well, actually, no, but I'm really close to figuring it out. Okay. I love the hair. Oh, yeah, hate the cape. We can work with the boots. Triplicate girl. Planet cargg. Okay, so, this is phantom girl. She's shy. Proty, our class pet. Hello. And arms fall off boy. And sometimes they even stay on. Wow. That's... really cool. No. We suck. Hey, that's not true. I'll have you know my psychic pathfinding powers are unique. Yes, so are mine. That doesn't mean they're good. There's only one open legion spot. And everyone knows mon e! Is gonna get it. We're never going to make it into the legion. Faceit we're waiting-list material at best. Not even the legion of substitute heroes would have us. Hey, you don't know what's going to happen. I think everyone has the potential to be heroes, even people like brainiac 5. But maybe, for the safety of the rest of the buildings, you should just avoid him. The legion does more than simply fight. - We are the once called in... - Or maybe you can't. When there are disasters, diplomatic incidents or when people are in need of rescue. To be considered for the legion, you need to train your mind. So, who can solve this hyperdrive equation? Supergirl? Supergirl! That is clearly incorrect. The legion does more than simply solve problems. We are the front lines, stopping terrorists, administering justice, and preventing war. To be considered for the legion, you need to train your body. Training room, fight simulation beta. Acknowledged. Flight simulation beta will commence now. Got it! Oh, no. Too slow. No. You need a stabilizer so the a! System doesn't malfunction. No, you don't, because it's already in the programming. I am literally the descendant of a cyborg. Logically, you should be listening to me. I'm from Krypton. We invented robotics. And I'm from colu, we perfected them. I'm right! You are objectively in the wrong. Okay. Maybe it did need a stabilizer. We need to shut it down. - If you damage the psionic processor... - Way ahead of you. Just give me some space to move. There. Engage the motion targeting system. Understood. Everyone stay perfectly still. Got it. Impressive thinking. In truth, I almost forgot this was all your fault. My fault? Listen, you green skinned, overgrown, poor excuse for a cyborg. - Where do you get off telling me... - Nope, I'm done. You're done. Training over. - You two are out. - But_ Disappointment doesn't even begin to cover your actions. We will deal with you in the morning. Until then... Hey, don't beat yourself up. Honestly, you are not the first person to get into a fight with brainiac 5. - Really? - Are you serious? Mr. "I'm more logical than thou?" He's a jerk who thinks he's better than everyone. No one wants him around. Not even timber wolf and the other legionnaires. I mean, hejust doesn't belong here. What? Supergirl. You coming? Like I said, we've got to go before all the good seats are taken. Proty. Where are you? Please come back before I have to tell dawnstar I lost you again. Here, proty, proty, proty. You good little, uh, thing. Ugh. You know what? I'm cold and tired. Let's give ourselves one more minute, then figure out a way to blame bouncing boy for this. There you are. What the heck? Hey, brainiac 5. Look, I'm... I was kind of a jerk to you. I mean, you were a biggerjerk to me. Brainiac 5. I think we got off on the wrong foot, but I think we're more alike than you know and... Why is this so hard? Brainiac 5, I'm sorry. Can we start over? What are you doing? Go away. This doesn't concern you. Uh-huh. Because it looks like you're trying to... I don't... Proty? What are you doing out? Is she... She... she can't be. I'm too late. You won't be needing this. Stay back, Supergirl. Brainiac 5 is not who he pretends to be. He planted a virus in our computer system. It's why we haven't been able to reach the rest of the legion. And no one voted to let him join the academy. He hacked in and changed the tally. All for this. To break into the vault and steal the weapons inside for some sick plot. We moved as fast as we could once we knew, but... Poor triplicate girl paid the price for our stupidity in trusting a brainiac. Yes, I hacked your computers, but I did not kill triplicate girl. This is the work of the dark circle. They've been planning to infiltrate the legion... You expect us to believe that? You have to! I would never hurt... You're just another clone gone bad. We'll be at the holding cells. Put hq on lockdown. We'll break the news in the morning. Wait. This doesn't make any sense. Why would brainiac 5 go to the vault, kill triplicate girl and then walk away, only to come back just in time to get caught? She clearly surprised him the first time. He stupidly panicked, then came back to finish the job. Exactly. That's stupid, and brainiac 5 isn't stupid. What if he wasn't lying? I feel like I've heard the name dark circle before. It's... Familiar somehow. Brainiac 5 is evil. You were right. Go back to the dorms. It's over now. Training room, access library databanks. Bring up any information you have on the dark circle. Accessing files on the dark circle. Searching. Searching. Found. The dark circle. A terrorist cult. The dark circle has gone by many names over the centuries. The black zero. The ouroboros. The beginning. The end. But they are always identified by the same symbol. Who are they? Fanatics, pursuing an unknown goal. Over the centuries, they emerge to wreak havoc, blowing up buildings, providing weapons of advanced origin to other terrorist groups. There are even reports of them appearing as observers. Watching. Waiting. Then they vanish. No trace to be found. Leader, unknown. Origins, unknown. End of file. Powering down. Huh? I've seen them, the dark circle, in the past and also here, now. You said I'm too late. Too late for what? What's going on? I'm not going anywhere, so talk. You're relentless. You know that, right? Created by the god-like controllers of oa, the miracle machine allows a user to bend reality to their will. Its original purpose disappeared with the controllers. Since then, it has been used as a weapon of mass destruction. The legion managed to get their hands on it, and placed it in the vault. I overheard my family making plans to break into the vault and steal the machine for the circle's leader. I couldn't let that happen. So, logically, there was only one thing to do. Enroll myself in the academy and take the machine before they did. Wouldn't the logical thing have been to just tell the legion? Ah, yes, let's try that. "Hi, I'm the grandson of one of earth's greatest villains. My family is psychotic, and I need you to let me take a weapon of mass destruction." Why would they believe me? No one ever does. I'm sure you assume I'm lying too, so... You know, just go. Come on. If the dark circle is here, we don't have very much time. What are you doing? I'm helping you break into the vault and get the machine. If they had it, they'd have used it by now. I think we can still beat them. No, I mean, why? Because I believe you. Timber wolf and the others will be patrolling. How are we going to get past them without my belt? And this is humiliating. This is fun! I had a nightmare like this once. If you don't stop complaining, I'll start flying upside down. All right, the coast is clear. Wait... Supergirl, I... Logically, you have no reason to help me, but you are. So, for my previous actions, - I'm sorry... - Shh. Are you trying to get caught? Keep it down. Mon El? I heard timber wolf and the others talking as I was heading back to the dorms. I know everything and I want to help. I trust Supergirl. If she thinks you're innocent, then I do too. That's great! We could definitely use help. Right, brainy? Yeah. Great. Of course! So, what are we doing? Breaking the universe's most unbreakable security system. - What is this? - This is the security code. The vault has a two-step process. First, the laser grid, then this. Break the code and a door will open into the exact chamber we want. But we only have a short window of time. How short? If I don't break this in the next 30 seconds, they kill us. Can you do it? I'm brainiac 5. The universe's only 12th-level intelligence. I can do anything. Incredible. The code is a holographic neural overlay designed to cook the user's brain, unless they can decrypt while keeping a mental lock on their objective. This is... Going to take longer than I thought. How much longer? More than 30 seconds. Keep working on the code. I'll take out the robots. Whatever you do, don't destroy them. The instant one breaks, it'll trigger a purge of the entire room. Brainy, I'm not great at gently fighting things. Just try! Not to rush you, but hurry it up. I'm trying. The code keeps resetting. Got it! That's it. Whoo! We did it! We did it. We certainly did. Brainiac 5 broke the code... And the circle remains unbroken. Kara! What are you doing? For the universe's only 12th-level intellect, you sure are dumb, aren't you? I'm in the dark circle. I'd stop moving so much if I were you. It spreads the kryptonite from the dagger faster. Why? Of all people, you should understand. Your culture was the greatest the universe had ever seen. Orderly. Uniform. Pure. But this world we live in, this world is rotten. The legion is the heart of the rot, encouraging losers like triplicate girl and bouncing boy. They delude misfits into thinking they can be heroes, when they're just freaks. Now, the dark circle will take over. We, who are superior, will lead the way... Elevating the world to heights not seen since the Kryptonian empire. The legion has fallen. The time of freaks has ended. As for you two, our leader would like a word. Hold on, Kara. Just hold on. Be silent in the presence of the beginning and the end. Hello, grandson. Brainiac. No, impossible. You're dead. You died in the 2ist century! The kryptonite bullet went through my brain, yes, but there was enough left to rebuild around the damage. And a genius like myself never goes without a backup plan. I created the dark circle a 1,000 years past to carry out my vision for a new world. It was the circle who stole my brain out of my old body. It was they who regrew it, tending to me over the centuries. But all would be for naught if it weren't for you. What do you mean? Did you think you just happened to overhear our plans to take the miracle machine? The other clones were mere 10th-level intelligences. There was only one being in the universe who could break the security code. You. We used you to get the machine. Were... You said my clone siblings were 10th-level. Where are they? Hmm. Right here. By the time my brain finished regrowing, my old body was useless. The circle cloned me, and I picked the best parts from each to build a new one. They weren't pleased when they found out. You lied to us. Stay away! Stay away from me! No! No! God, no! But, logically, what other purpose could you serve? The fools thought they were being groomed as the next leader of the dark circle. For hubris alone, they deserve death. I am the most advanced mind that has ever existed. Thus, logically, I must be the one to purge the universe of chaos and rot. For those who are superior will lead the way to a pure and orderly future. The only one strong enough to stop me was Supergirl. So, we watched her and found her weakness. Kryptonite. And your drive to help those more pathetic than yourself. You're a monster. I am a hero. There are threats on the horizon only I can counter. When I bend reality to my will, all will laud me as their savior. Once Supergirl is dead, I will incorporate you into my body. The son will become the father, and the circle will remain unbroken. Find them. I will begin to attune myself to the machine. Hurts. It's going to be okay. I just need to get the kryptonite out of your wound, all right? No! I'm working on something, but you've got to stay awake. Kara. Kara? Trying to. Keep talking. Talking to people is not my strong suit. Could I list chemical compositions instead? No, no, no. Kara! Stay with me. I'm sorry. I was wrong about everything. I'm supposed to be smart and logical, but my plan to stop the dark circle wasn't logical. It was me trying to prove to everyone that I... I'm not my family. I'm not just another evil clone. But I'm not. I messed it up. I'm not like you. You're so confident, and brilliant, and strong, and... And? And beautiful. And? And I can't think straight when you smile at me. - Well, there you two are. - Finally. Good work, pg. - Triplicate girl? - You're alive. Yeah, no thanks to mon El! You know that son of a bitch killed me? You know, I saw him meeting up with those people in masks. I peeled off an extra me right before I got to the vault and he killed my third self. So, I need you nerds to come up with a plan to save the day so I can kill him right back. Did I mention, I'm going to kill him? Yeah, only about, like, a million times. Invisible kid? In the flesh. Phantom girl found triplicate girl right before the attack. I managed to turn invisible and escape. And the three of us have been hiding ever since. And your clothes are... On! The clothes are on! I turned all of me invisible this time. See, I told you. I told you I almost had it. So, the teachers are knocked out, the rest of the academy members are trapped, and I am just itching to give mon e! A little... Payback. What happened to, "we're waiting-list material?" No. Screw that. I'm pissed. Now, we're kicking-ass material. The legion is gone. It's up to us. So, let's go be heroes. You've got an idea, don't you? I have the beginnings of a plan, yes, but_ We'll need all the academy members to pull it off. Yeah. Uh, excuse me. Is the plan to flirt forever? Because we're kind of in a time crunch here, lovebirds. Oh, that's not I... I mean... It's okay. What do you need us to do? I can't find a trace of the legion anywhere. Then let me. Still nothing... Quadrant beta, orbiting the black star by planet winath. Encrypting message, compensating for cosmic interference from the black hole, and the sos is... Sent. - Yes! - Yeah! All right! Now, the hard part. Keep searching. Brainiac has almost finished syncing to the machine. We can't let them ruin this now. You mean us? Get them! Nice try. Move away from the machine, brainiac. It's over. No. It is just beginning. I see it. The shape of all things. An endless circle, which I break and form anew. Those deluded enough to think themselves my equal will fall. As will those strong enough to ever pose a threat. And any world that could ever disrupt the dominance of brainiac! I thought I was brilliant before, but I was nothing. Now, I am the supreme being! Hardly. You just happen to be the one holding the machine. I always thought us clones surpassed you. You were copies of greatness. I am the mastermind of reality. I am the leader of the dark circle. I am... The greatest mind the universe has ever known! I am greater than what came before me. I am a 10th-level intellect and you are nothing. No! You serve me. Your wills are no match for mine! You are obsolete. As long as the miracle machine is in this reality, it will obey the will of its last user. And that will be me, not you. No, it will be me. I am the heir to the dark circle! I alone will rule this new reality. No, iwill. Stop! You will destroy us, you idiots! There can only be... Oneleader who's it going to be? It's not stopping. Brainiac 4 was right. The machine won't stop until reality unravels. How is this the only thing I'm not able to break? Mom? I... I could bring her back. I could bring Krypton back. But it won't stop reality from breaking. Imiss you... Every single day. I wish things were different. But Krypton is gone. And I'm needed here. I have to let you go now... And save the world. I just hope I've made you proud. Always, my Kara, always. The miracle machine will continue to destroy everything as long as it's in this reality. - So... - Let's will it into a different one. Thank you. For what? I got ya, triplicate girl! Thanks, bouncy. It's duplicate girl now. I like the new name. What about "duo damsel?" Ya know, alliteration's kinda cool. Never mind. Wait. We're picking new names? Then from now on, I am arms fall off man! Oh. All right. I love it! I thought you said they were useless! They... they were. Retreat! Everyone, fall back! Oh, no, you don't. Pg, here! Hey, guys. Save any for us? There's still time to change your mind. There will always be a place in the dark circle for those with true power. You and I could lead it. And bring back the pride of Krypton. Oh, mon El, you'rejust wrong. Hey there, mon El. Where are you going? Shit. That's the last of them for the holding cells. All that's left to do is wait for... Damn. I vote they all get in as full legionnaires. I'm sorry we couldn't bring Krypton back. Or your mother. If you want, I could start researching a way to replicate the machine. I mean, logically, it would be a terrible idea but... It's okay. Earth's not so bad. It's... Definitely got a couple of good points. Interesting. In the name of research, we better add to those points. Genius idea. And then duplicate girl shot him! And then she shot him again. In retrospect, I think it was a mistake to let her keep that gun. But saturn girl was still thrilled! That's great, Kara. Seems like being a legionnaire really suits you. Oh, and brainy's been making tons of upgrades on legion hq, including rigging up the time bubbles so we can talk more. Here, hold on. What are you... Kara. Kal, I'd like you to meet brainiac 5, the universe's only 12th-level intellect and my boyfriend. It's... it's an honor to meet you. I mean, talk... Uh... Sir. I'm happy to meet you, brainiac 5. Uh, but if you two will excuse me, I've got to get back to being... Superman. - Of course. - Bye, kal. Talk soon. You didn't tell her? How am I supposed to ask her to come back to the 2ist century when we still don't know what's happening?
