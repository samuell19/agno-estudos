I think it's our tradition It comes out of a particularly painful part of our history. Yes. Yes. But it's been a way we've been able to heal. At first it was a reminder of the rebellion It was the price the Districts had to pay. But I think it has grown from that. I think it's a It's something that knits us all together. This is your third year's game? What defines your personal signature? Shhhh. It's okay. It's okay. You're just dreaming. You're dreaming. It was me. I know. But it's not. It's your first year. Prim, your name's only been there once, they're not gonna pick you! Try to go to sleep. I can't. Just try. Just try. Deep in the meadow. Under the willow. Hop in the grass. A soft green and pillow. You remember that song? Ok. You finish it. I gotta go. Where? I just gotta go. But I'll be back. I love you. I'll still cook you. What are you gonna do with that when you kill it? Damn you, Gale! It's not funny. What're you gonna do with a 100 pound deer, Katnap? It's Reaping Day, the place is crawling with Peacekeepers. I was gonna sell it, to Peacekeepers. Of course you were. Like you don't sell the Peacekeepers. No! Not today. It was the first deer, I've seen in a year. Now, I have nothing. Okay. What if they did? Just one you. Why if everyone just stop watching? They won't, Gale. What if they did? What if we did? It won't happen. You root for your favorite, you cry when they get killed. It's sick. Yeah. If no one watches..,.. Then they don't have a game. It's as simple as that. What? Nothing. Fine, laught at..,.. I'm not laughing at you. We could do it, you know? Take off. Live in the woods. What we do anyway? They'd catch us. Maybe not. Cut out our tongues or worse. We wouldn't make it five miles. No, I get five miles. I'd go that way. I have Prim and you have your brothers. They can come too. Prim in the woods? Maybe not. I'm never having kids. I might. If I don't live here. But you do live here. I know, but if I didn't. Oh, I forgot. Here. Oh my God! Is this real? Yeah. Better be. Cost me a squirrel. Happy Hunger Games. And be the odds be ever in your favor. How many times has your name entered it? Forty two. Guess the odds aren't exactly in my favor. Thank you girl. What's this? That's a..,.. Mockingjay. How much? You keep it. It's yours. Thank you. Mom? Aww. Look at you. You look beautiful. Let's better tuck in that tail by the back. Made something out for you two. Okay. Now you look beautiful too. Wish I look liked you. Oh no. I wish I look liked you. You wanna see what I got you today? It's a Mockingjay pin. To protect you. And as long as you have it. Nothing bad will happen to you. Okay? I promise. Shh. Shh. Prim, it's okay. It's okay. Shh. Okay, it's time to send her now. Okay, they will prick your finger to take just a little bit of blood. I'm scared. Prim, it doesn't hurt much. Just a little. Okay? Go sit down there with the little kids. I'll find you after okay? Next. Next. Go ahead. Next. Next. Next. Next. Welcome. Welcome. Welcome. Happy Hunger Games. And..,.. May the odds be ever in your favor. Now, before we begin. We have a very special film. Brought to you all the way from the Capitol. War..,.. Terrible war. With those..,.. Orphan..,.. and a motherless child. This was the uprising that rocked our land. Thirteen districts rebeled against the country that fed them, Loved them. Protected them. Brother turned on brother until nothing remained. Then came the peace. Hard fought. Sorely won. The people. Rose up from the ashes and a new era was born. But freedom has a cost. And the traitors were defeated. We swore as a nation we would never know this treason again. And so it was decreed..,.. That each year. The various districts of Panem would offer up in tribute One young man and woman to fight to the death in a pageant of honor, courage and sacrifice. The lone victor..,.. Bathed in riches..,.. would serve as a reminder of our generosity and our forgiveness. This is how we remember our past. This is how we safeguard our future. I just love that. Now, the time has come for us to select one courageous young man and woman. For the honor of representing District 12 in the 74th Annual Hunger Games. As usual..,.. ladies first. Primrose Everdeen! Where are you dear? Come on up. Well, come on up! Prim! Prim! No! I volunteer! I volunteer as Tribute. I believe we have a volunteer. - You need to get out of here. - No! - Go find mom! - No! - Prim, go find mom! - No! I'm so sorry! No! Noo! Noo! Nooo! Noooo! In mad of turn of events here on District 12. District 12's very first volunteer. Big breath. Come on dear. What's your name? Katniss Everdeen. Well, I bet my hat that was your sister. Wasn't it? Yes. Let's have a big hand for our very first volunteer, Katniss Everdeen. And now..,.. for the boys. Peeta Mellark. Here we are. Our Tributes from District 12. Well, come on you two. Shake hands. Happy Hunger Games. And be the odds be ever in your favor. You have 3 minutes. Prim, Prim, its okay. Shh. Prim, I don't have much time. Prim, listen. You're gonna be okay. Don't take any extra food from them. It isn't worth putting in your name more times, okay? Listen, Prim. Gale will bring you game. you can sell cheese from your goat. Just try to win. Maybe you can. Maybe I can, I'm smart you know? You can hunt. Exactly. To protect you. Thank you. You can't tune out again. I won't. No, you can't. Not like when dad died. I won't be there anymore. You're all she has. No matter what you feel, you will be there for her. Do you understand? Don't cry. Don't cry. Don't. It's time. It's okay. Prim, it's okay. No! No! I promise Prim. I'm fine. Yeah, I know. I am. Listen to me. You're stronger than they are. You are. Get to a bow. / I may not have a bow..,.. What will if you show them how good you are. They just want a good show. That's all they want. If they don't have a bow, then you make one, okay? Okay? You know how to hunt. Animals. There's no different Katniss. They're twenty four of us, Gale, and only one comes out. Yeah. And it's gonna be you. Okay. Take care of them Gale. Whatever you do, don't let them starve. Let's go! I'll see you soon okay? You two haven't had trip? Crystal chandeliers. Platinum donuts. 200 miles per hour and you can barely feel a thing. I think its one of the wonderful thing is about this opportunity, that even though you're here and even though it's just for a little while. You get to enjoy all of this. I'm going to find Haymitch. He's probably in the bar car. Have you ever met him? Haymitch? You know, Katniss, he is our mentor. He did win this things once. Look! You know if you don't want to talk, I understand. But I just don't think there's anything wrong with getting a little bit of help. Congratulations. Where's the ice? I don't..,.. I don't know. Okay, so uh..,.. so when do we start? Whoah. You're so eager. Most of you aren't in such a hurry. Yeah. I wanna know what the plan is. You're our mentor, you're supposed to go..,.. Mentor? Yeah. Our mentor, you're supposed to tell us how to get sponsors and give us advice. Oh, okay. Ummm..,.. embrace the probability of your imminent death. and know, in your heart, that there's nothing I can do to save you. So why are you here then? The refreshments. Okay, I think that's enough of that. You made me spill my drink. It's a brand new pants. You know, I think I'll go finish this in my room. He's gonna come around. What? It's no use. I'm gonna go talk to him. We have two..,.. 16 year olds. Yes. Do you remember this year? Aww. One of my favorite years. And one of my favorite arenas. The use of the rubble, the ruin city. Very exciting. And this moment here..,.. this moment..,.. is the moment that you never forget. The moment..,.. when a Tribute..,.. becomes a victor. You'd freeze to death first. No, cause I'd have a lot of fire. Now that's a good way to get killed. What's a good way to get killed? Oh! Joy. Why don't you join us? I'm just saving a life-saving advice. Like what? I wa..,.. I was just asking about how to find shelter. Which would come in handy if in fact you were still alive. How do you find shelter? Pass the jam? How do you find shelter? Give me a chance to wake up sweetheart. This mentoring is very..,.. taxing stuff. Can you pass the marmalade? That is mahogany. Look at you! Just killed a..,.. place mat! You really wanna know how to stay alive? You get people to like you. Oh! Not what you're expecting. When you're in the middle of the games..,.. and you're starving or freezing, some water, a knife or even some matches can mean the difference between life and death. And those things only comes from Sponsors. And to get Sponsors, you have to make people like you. And right now, sweetheart, You're not off to a really good start. There it is. It's huge. That's incredible. Come on. You better keep this knife, he knows what he's doing. So now that you've seen them, what do you think about this year's crop of recruits? Are there any surprises that we can expect this year? It's really hard to tell from a reaping but I think..,.. this is a very interesting mix. Yes. Whenever you have a volunteer from an outlying district, that's something you can't ignore. What's that? What's that? We were just saying we might need to hose you down again before we take you to Cinna. That was on of the bravest thing I've ever seen for your sister. My name is Cinna. Katniss. I'm sorry that this happened to you. And I'm here to help you in any way I can. Most people just congratulate me. I don't see the point in that. So tonight they have the Tribute Parade. they're gonna take you out and show you off to the world. So you're here to make me look pretty. I'm here to help you make an impression. Now usually, they dress people in their close to their district. Yeah. our's was coal miners. Yeah. But I don't wanna to do that. I'm gonna do something that they're gonna remember. Did they explain about trying to get sponsors? Yeah, but I'm not very good at making friends. We'll see. I just think, somebody that brave shouldn't be dressed up on some stupid costume now, should they? I hope not. It's not real fire. These suits are built so you won't feel a thing. That very well to me. The idea..,.. You ready? Don't be afraid. I'm not afraid. Over one hundred thousand people craning to get a glimpse this year's Tributes. And the Sponsors get to see the Tributes for the first time. The importance of this moment cannot be overstated. Very nice. First cheered on my counting in 15..,.. ..,..14..,.. 13..,.. Here they are. Here they are. This year's Tributes. It looks exciting. It just gives you goose bumps. Don't you love how the stylists, they so clearly are able to reflect the character of each district? Right, right. There's District 4! Yes, the fishing. I get it. I like it. That's very good. And behind them we have two power plant workers, right? And then what is that in the background? Come on. They'll love it. Now see that! I love that. Two young people, holding their hands up! Saying; "I'm proud, I'm from District 12. We will not be overlooked!" I love that. People are sure to be paying attention to them right now. And we're ready. President Snow, you're live! Welcome. Welcome. Tributes. We welcome you. We salute the courage and your sacrifice. And we wish you happy Hunger Games. And may the odds be ever in your favor. That was amazing. We are all anybody's going to be talking about! So brave. Are you sure you should be near an opening flame? Fake flame? Are you sure? Let's uh..,.. let's go upstairs. So each of the districts got their own floor and because you're from 12, you get the penthouse. Come on. So this is the living room. I know! Now, your rooms are right over here. Why don't you go clean yourselves up a little before dinner. In two weeks twenty three of you will be dead. One of you will be alive. Who that is depends on how well you pay attention over the next four days. Particularly to what I'm about to say. First. No fighting with the other Tributes. You'll have plenty of time for that in the arena. There are four compulsory exercises, the rest will be individual training. My advice is; Don't ignore the survival skills. Everybody wants to grab a sword but most of you wil die from natural causes. 10% from infection. 20% from dehydration. Exposure can kill as easily as a knife. Where's my knife? Where did you put it? I put my knife..,.. Don't touch me..,.. Fuck! You took my knife! I didn't touch your knife. I didn't touch your kni..,.. You liar. You little punk! You took my knife. Get off me. Just sit here. I should better wait for the arena. You're the first one I get so watch your back huh! Everybody back in line. You know you're next to me Cato! He's a career. You know what that is? From District 1. ..,..and 2. They train in a special academy until they're eighteen then they volunteer, By that point, they're pretty lethal. But they don't receive any special treatment. they stay in the exact same apartment as you do. And I don't think they let them have desert, and you can. So how good are they? They win it almost every year, but..,.. They won in almost several year but..,.. Almost..,.. They can be arrogant. And arrogance can be a big problem. I hear you can shoot. I'm alright. She's better than alright, my father buys her squirrels. He say she hits them right in the eye everytime. - Peeta's strong. - What? He can throw a hundred pound sack of flour right in his head. I've seen it. Okay, well I'm not gonna kill anybody with a sack of flour. No, you might have a better chance of winning if somebody comes after you with a knife. I have no chance of winning. None! Alright? It's true. Everybody knows it. You know what my mother said? She said, "District 12 might finally have a winner!" But she wasn't talking about me. She was talking about you. I'm not very hungry. I'm done too. Throw that metal thing over there. What? No. Haymitch says we're not supposed to show our skills. I don't care what Haymitch said. Those guys are looking at you like you're a meal. Throw it. Hi. Hey. How did you do that? I uh..,.. I used to take care of the cakes down at the bakery. I'll show you. See? Wow. Yeah. I think you have a shadow. Tomorrow. They'll bring you in one by one. they'll evaluate you. This is important because high ratings will mean Sponsors. This is the time to show them everything. There'll be a bow, make sure you use it. Peeta, you make sure to show your strength. They'll start with District 1 so the two of you will go last. Well, I don't know how else to put this. Make sure they remember you. Katniss Everdeen. Hey Katniss. Shoot straight. Katniss Everdeen. District 12. Thank you, for your consideration. Are you crazy? I just got mad. Mad? You realize that your actions reflect badly on all of us, not just you. They just want a good show, it's fine. How about it's just bad manner, Cinna? How about that? Well, finally! I hope you noticed, we have a serious situation. Nice shooting sweetheart! Wha.. Wha..,.. What did they..,.. What did they do when you shot the apple? Well, they look pretty startled. What did you say..,.. "Thanks for..,.. " ..,..consideration. Genius! Genius. I don't think we're gonna find this funny If the game makers decided to take it out..,.. On who? On her? On him? I think they already have. Loosen your corset and have a drink. I would have given anything to see it. As you know the Tributes are rated on a scale of one to twelve after three days of careful evaluation. The game keepers would like to evaluate..,.. From District 1, Marvel. score of 9. Cato, score of 10. Clove, score of 10. Four, score of..,.. From District 7..,.. From District..,.. Rue, score of 7. From District 12..,.. Peeta Mellark..,.. score of..,.. Eight. - Ooh, Peeta. - Not bad. Bravo. And finally..,.. From District 12 Katniss Everdeen. With score of..,... Eleven. Congratulations. I thought they hated me. They must have liked your guts. To Katniss Everdeen..,.. The Girl On Fire! An eleven? She earned it. She shot an arrow at your head. Well, at an apple. Near your head. Sit down. Seneca, why do you think we have a winner? What do you mean? I mean, why do we have a winner? I mean if we just wanted to intimidate the Districts, why not round up twenty four at random, and execute them all at once? Way a lot faster..,.. Hope. Hope? Hope. It is the only thing stronger than fear. A little hope is effective. A lot of hope is dangerous. Spark is fine, as long as it's contained. So? So..,.. contain it. Right. If she's staring at all my jewels, she cannot take her eye from..,.. Frankly..,.. it was rude. Oh, Haymitch. You should join us. We're having some of your favorite dish. Oh, lovely. Where's Peeta? He's in his room. Now listen Tomorrow's the last day. And they let us work with our own tributes right before the game so you and I will be going down at nine. Well, what about him? No, he says he wants to be trained on his own from now on. What? It's kind of thing does happen at this point. There's only one winner, right? We should have some chocolate covered stroke. Hm, right Please. Ladies and gentlemen. Your master of ceremonies..,.. Caesar Flickerman! Thank you! Thank you! Welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome. To the 74th Annual Hunger Games. Now, we all have five minutes that they are all going to be out here. All of the Tributes that you heard about. Are you excited? Let me hear it! Amazing. I don't feel amazing. Don't you know how beautiful you look? No. And I don't know how to make people like me, how do you make people like you? Well you made me like you. That's different, I wasn't trying. Exactly. Just be yourself. I'll be there the whole time, and just pretend you're talking to me. Okay? Okay. Let's see if she does indeed shine. Let's have a warm round of applause for Glimmer. Glimmer, are you prepared? Yes Caesar, I am very prepared. I like it, that's insurance, self-insurance. Big round of applause. Marvel! Welcome Clove. It's an honor to represent my district. So you're a fighter? I'm prepared, vicious and I'm ready to go. Cato! I can apply myself to situation present and I'll be able to. thank you. It's lovely to see you. Thank you so much. From District 12..,.. You know her as the girl on fire! Where we know her as the lovely Katniss Everdeen! What? I think someone's a little nervous. I said that was quite and entrance that you've made at the Tribute's parade the other day. Do you want to tell us about it? Well, I was just hoping that I wouldn't burned to death. When you came out of that chariot, I have to say My heart..,.. stopped. Did any of you experience this as well? My heart stopped. So did mine. Now tell me bout the flames. Were they real? Yes. In fact I'm wearing them today. Would you like to see? Wait, wait, wait. Is it safe? What do you think folks? I think that's a yes! Ohhh. Steady. Steady. Lovely make it. That was really something. Katniss, that was something. That was something. Thank you for that. I have one more question for you. It's about your sister, We were all very moved, I think when, you volunteered for her at the reaping. Does she come to say goodbye to you. Yes. She did. She did. And what did you say to her, In the end? I told her that I would try to win. That I will try to win for her. Of course you did. And try you will. Ladies and gentlemen, from District 12, Katniss Everdeen, The Girl On Fire! You did it darling. That was incredible. Thank you. Nice job sweetheart. Thank you. Nice dress too. Not yours. Please welcome, Peeta Mellark! Peeta, welcome. How are you finding the Capitol? Don't say with a map. Uh, it's uh..,.. different. It's very different. Different? In what way? Give us an example. Uh okay, well the showers here are weird. Showers? Yes. We have different showers. I have a question for you Caesar. Do I smell like roses to you? Um..,.. Do I? Yeah. Do I smell like it? You definitely smell better than I do. Well I live here longer. That makes sense. Lovely, So Peeta..,.. tell me. Is there a special girl back home? No, not really. No? I don't believe it for a second. Look at that face. Handsome man like you, Peeta. Tell me. Well, there a There's this one girl that I had a crush on forever. But I don't think she actually recognize me until the reaping. Well..,.. I'll tell you what Peeta. You go out there..,.. and you win this thing. And when you get home, she'll have to go out with you. Right folks? Thanks but I uh..,.. I don't think winnings gonna help me at all. And why not? Because she came here with me. Well, that's bad luck. Yeah. It is. And I wish you all the best of luck. Thank you. Peeta Mellark. District 12! What the hell is that?! You don't talk to me and then you say you have a crush on me? You say you wanna train alone? Is that how you wanna play? Stop! Stop it! Let's start right now. He did you a favor. He made me look weak. He made you look desirable. Which in your case, can't hurt sweetheart! He's right Katniss. Of course, I'm right. Now I can sell the star cross lovers from District 12. We are not star cross lovers. It's a television show. And being in love with that boy might just get you sponsors which could save your damn life. Okay, why don't you get out of here? Maybe I can deliver you both in one piece tomorrow. Manners. You too? Oh, hey. Can't sleep? No, of course not. I'm sorry I went after you. You know I meant that as a compliment. I know. Listen to them. Yeah? I just hope they don't change me. How would they change you? I don't know. Turn me into something I'm not. I just don't wanna be another piece in their game, you know? You mean you won't kill anyone? No. No. I'm sure I would, just like anybody else when the time came. Yeah, I just keep..,.. But, you know, I just keep wishing I could think of a way to show them that they don't own me. You know, if I'm gonna die, I wanna still be me. Does that make any sense? Yeah. I just can't afford to think like that. I miss my sister. Yeah I know. Guess, I'll see you tomorrow. See you tomorrow. They put all kind of stuff right in front. Right in the mouth of the Cornucopia. There'll even be a bow there. Don't go for it. Why not? It's a bloodbath, they're trying to pull you in. That's not your game. You turn, run, find a high ground. Look for water. Water's your new best friend. Don't step off that pedestal earlier or they'll blow you sky high. I won't. Katniss. You can do this. Thanks. Give me your arm. Give me your arm. Give me your arm. What is that? Your tracker. Less than a minute people! Final checks. So fifteen up, they are flying. Here.

And Claudius, I think I see alliance forming. Please don't kill me. Oh no! Hey, loverboy! You sure she went this way? Yeah, I'm sure. You better be. Yeah. That was a steer comb back there. Are you sure we shouldn't just kill him now? Nah. He's our best chance at finding her. Let's go. Let's go. Sir. She is almost at the edge. Two kilometers away from the nearest Tribute. Let's turn her around. Killing another on my account..,.. one. Two. Uh, she's heading towards the left flank. Okay. - Can you give me tree back there? - Sure. She's almost there. Lucia, get a cannon ready. Oh there she is. There she is. What you got baby? Kill here Cato! I'm coming for you! I'll do it myself. Get her! Come on. Come on. Maybe you should throw the sword. Let's just wait her out. She gotta come down at some point, it's that or starve to death. Let's kill her then. Okay. Somebody make a fire. Thank you. Claudius. I think those are tracker jackers. Am I wrong? Oooh. Those things are very lethal. Very. For those of you who don't know Tracker jackers..,.. Are genetically engineered wasps. Whose venom causes searing pain. Powerful hallucinations and in extreme cases, death. Run! Run! Run! Damn it. Go! Katniss, no! What're you doing? Go! Hallow isn't lethal.

Katniss, go! Get out of here! What're you doing? Go! Rue? It's okay. I'm not gonna hurt you. You want mine too? No, that's okay. Here. Thanks. How long was I asleep? A couple of days. I change your leaves twice. Thank you. So what happened? When I was out? The girl from 1 and the boy from 10. And the uh..,.. And the boy from my district? No, he's okay. I think he's down by the river. Is all about true? What? You and him. So where are Cato and the others? They got all their supplies down by the lake. It's prod up in this great big pyramid. That sounds tempting. Now this green stuff is gonna smoke like crazy, so as soon as you light it. Move on to the next fire. Light this one last. And I'll meet you back over there. Right. I'll destroy their stuff while they're chasing us. We need a signal, in case one of us gets held up. Okay. Like what? Here. Watch this. Mockingjays. That's great. Back home we use them signal all the time. You try. Okay so, if we hear that means we're okay and we'll be back real soon. We're gonna be okay. Hey. I'll see you for supper. Okay. Guys, guys look! Come here. Come on, come on look! Let's go. You stay guard over, till we get back. I wanna see if she's gonna figure out this booby trap. Yes.

Deep in the meadow. Under the willow. A bed of grass. A soft, green pillow. Lay down your head. And close your eyes. Don't kill her. You'd just create a martyr. Well it seems we've already got one. I hear these rumors out of district 11, This could get away from here. What do you want? You have a lot of anger out there. I know you know how to handle a mob, you've done it before. If you can't scare them. Give them something to root for. Such as? Young love. So you like an an underdog. Everyone likes an underdog. I don't. How many are dead? 10? 11? 12? Uh..,.. Not personally, no! Well I have. Lots of underdogs. Not too coal too. Raw crops. Minerals. Things we need. There are lots of underdogs. And I think if you could see them. You would not root for the martyr. I like you, be careful. Attention Tributes. Attention! The regulations acquiring a single victor has been suspended! From now on, two victors maybe crowned if both originate from the same district. This will be the only announcement. Peeta. Oh my God! Peeta! Peeta! Hi. It's okay. What was it? The sword. It's bad, huh? It's gonna be fine. Katniss..,.. Katniss! No! I'm not gonna leave you! I'm not gonna do that. Why not? Nobody's gonna find you in here. They already found me. We'll just get you some medicine. I'm not gonna get many parachutes. We'll figure something out. Like what? Something. Is that medicine? No! Soup. No, I'll do it. Nice taste. Well, you fed me once? I think about that all the time. How I tossed you that bread. Peeta. I should have gone to you. I should've just gone out in the rain and..,... You feel hot. I remember the first time I saw you. Your hair was in two braids instead of one. I remember when you..,.. You sang in music assembly, the teacher said; Who knows The Valley song? And your hand shot straight up. Peeta, stop. After that, I watched you going home everyday. Everyday. Well, say something. I'm not good at saying something. Then come here. Please. Please. Even if I don't make it..,.. Ssh! Attention Tributes.
