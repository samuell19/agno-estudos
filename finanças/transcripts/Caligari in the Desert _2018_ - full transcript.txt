Basically, I am a desert rat. Never had a telephone, don't have a computer... The only modern technological device that I have and enjoy fully is a DVD player, so I watch DVDs. Something around 40 people live here as permanent residents. I'm retired, disabled, living on social security. I can live within my means here because I don't spend a lot. It's just a workshop, a menangerie, combination historical display and place where I mess around. Once I got into movies, silent movies, I'd notice the signage. Signage that appear in movie scenes. And, signs I really liked, so I had to make my own replicas of them or do my own versions of them. They're hand painted. So I have these little characters that I make out of styrofoam and paper and cardboard and glue and plaster and pingpong balls, just stick them together. They take less space than signage, and I'm running out of spaces to put signs. Most recent one I'm working on now will be a little three-dimensional "Dr. Caligari". He'll have his own little booth, and he'll be made out of styrofoam. But there'll also be a Caesar, and he won't be three-dimensional, he'll just be painted on a panel. My name is Roger Ball and I've lived in Randsburg 25 years, it'll be 26 years next month. And I came here originally in '91 to go to work at the mine, the gold mine up on the hill. The mine closed down in about 2001 and pulled up sticks and left, but I am still here. I worked for Rand Mining, and they did not like my hard hat because of Mickey Mouse and Rand Mining sign. But they don't exist anymore, so they can't complain. The interest in movies began with local history interest. Now, I thought if silent movies were filmed in Randsburg, it'd be interesting to find out... ...if they existed, because they'd show something of what Randsburg looked like in the 1920s or whenever the movies were filmed. Randsburg originated in 1895 with the discovery of gold. That's why the town exists. In its heyday, say around 1897, there's been high and low figures for the population. But say somewhere between two and three thousand residents. Miners, workers, storekeepers, dance halls, saloons, and a couple of churches even. Other mining towns, you know, old mining towns, didn't have churches. Just lots of saloons. Nowadays, the gold mining has ceased. But there are still residents who live in this town and the population is something around 40 permanent residents. But there are other people who have bought houses here for weekend use. Now, this is an early day school desk for lower grades small children. And it's very significant to this town, because it came from the Randsburg elementary school which is no longer standing. It's on loan to me from a 70-year-old resident. When she was a student, she marked her initials on the seat back. This building which is, currently, my workshop, it's also my home, I live here. But its origin was 1896. It was built as a Miner's Supply Store. I pay rent on, I don't own this building. I don't own anything. When I first took up occupancy, it was in a rather rough condition, because it had not been used since the end of the '40s, possibly the beginning of the '50s. These are new windows, new doors, the floor has been rebuilt, the ceiling on that side has been rebuilt. This building was originally built as a Miner's Supply Store and progressively over the years, it later became a grocery store. Modern for its time. It had its own freezing compartment that was added onto the building, with a very complex machinery in the cellar to keep the storage unit above the cellar on the first floor cold. And the machinery, essentially, is still in the cellar. Very rusty, very dust and dirt coated. That probably hasn't been in operation since the end of the '40s. This is not a business. It's my workshop. Beside that it''s my home. There's nothing for sale. What's here was done to decorate the walls in my home. The greatest fascination with silent movies is that it's seeing something that began from nothing. The very beginning of the movies, when they were born. And how they developed from the very beginning. There's a 1930, about '30 or '31 movie, "Polly of the Circus". And so, I made a almost three dimensional character copy of Marion Davies, just because she's in the movie. And it's been my first attempt at making something that moves. It's a lot of trial and error. Among the other photographs, there's a photo of King Vidor, director. And he has somewhat bearlike features. So, this little guy is... ...King Veebear. Randsburg had a movie theatre, which was called "Rand Theater". I'm not sure when it originated. But I know for sure it was there in 1933, and it existed until the early '50s, when it closed. It had seating for 250 people. Now, the movie theatre is gone, and these two seats and a few movie tickets from the Rand Theater are all that exists now. There's still some bubble gum. There's a lot of things in life that can be fascinating. As far as signage goes, that's a childhood fascination that I never grew out of. "If Wishes Were Horses, Beggars Would Ride." My mom told me that one, which you tell kids if they keep asking for stuff all the time, you know: "I want this, I want that." I'm not a sign painter, I just paint stuff. Some of the signs I paint are just made up thoughts. I just start a sign and make the thing. And then, other signs I try to make accurate replicas of signs that I just happen to like. And then, other signs are inspired by movies. And others are combinations inspired by movies, but not replicated, just adapted. "Fresh Sauerkraut" is a rendition of a sign that appeared in a movie that was filmed in Trona. Trona is a town 35 miles from here. There isn't much of anything that is not known to the State of California to cause cancer. "Cats not so clean. Don't wash face. Wash feet. Wipe feet on face." That's a saying I borrowed. It was read in an old desert magazine. "Black Bug's Blood" That was a 1930 movie. It was kinda like a running theme, just a little running theme that ran through the movie. One favourite sign, and it's "Ptomanie Annie's Coffee Pot". It appeared in a scene taken in a New York City diner in a movie that was filmed in 1940 or '41. There are actually very few people who wander in here. Now, out of that few, even fewer people find anything interesting. It's just once in a while certain people drop in and like what they see, enjoy, get something out of what they see here. I painted a sign "Chop House - Fine Dining", "Dining" mis-spelled. It was meant to hang out in front of the building over the door. Just for people who wanted to take novelty photographs of themselves under a sign... ...that didn't make sense. And I'd hung this "Chop House" sign up over the door outside just to see what it'd look like. And a car stops across the street with two people. They thought it was a Chop House and they were really hungry. And when they came inside and saw that this was not a diner, they were disappointed. I was a product of the '60s. In my 20s, I was very much into motorcycles. I lived in this little Dodge van, in the back of a van, in a downtown parking lot in a small city. One block away from the county court house. And in this little van, I also stored and worked on a 1961 Triumph Thunderbird which I rebuilt in that van and lived with. So I was pretty dedicated to motorcycles for all a decade and I'd like to go on solo tours, mostly the desert, I was always fascinated with the desert. 1986, 1987 or so, I took a vacation from a lumberyard that I worked at in Northern California, and ended up in Mojave desert. I just stayed here in the desert, living in the desert, since that time on. And then got jobs here, my last company job was actually here in the desert working for a gold mine as an equipment operator. That's some years in the past, too. So, now, here I am. Life just progressed. Change being a perpetual thing. And I find now that I'm not 21 anymore. Somehow, I got to be 64 and actually survived, somehow. Strange. Having gotten older, I'm no longer able to do things I used to do. And carpentry and masonry and all that, welding, is pretty much over with. But I still need to work with my hands and have something to do. So, I came up with the idea of combining the things that I enjoy: Working with my hands, old movies. Essentially, two things that I enjoy most. So, I started working on small figures. With the intention to do something very new and different, something that I'd never done before, a challenge. I want to make my own video. The little figures that I make, they're actors, I just don't have to pay them. My video will be titled: "Dr. Caligari's Carnival Show". Which is billed off of "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari", a 1919 German expressionist film. I got a computer to do editing, and a camcorder, two things that I never had before. A whole new world, and consequently, the adventure. I'm from the age of radioes and televisions that had vacuum tubes. I never imagined getting a computer until the idea of making a video necessitating a computer. And that's the sole purpose of getting a computer and learning how to use it is - so I can make a movie. Computer and video cameras, now, working with them is totally from scratch. At the age of 65, this is Neanderthal man meets iMac. I'm going about making a video using methods that were used by the early cameramen before they became "cinematographers". There is acts, like vaudville acts, that you can see on a stage, just non-connected with the others, that they're just entertainers. I am very partial to surrealism, having been a product of the '60s. A favorite artist is Salvador Dal√¨, a favorite photographer Man Ray. So, my video will be built on surrealism and expressionism. Very little money is spent on the actual characters and props. My performers, the characters, the sets and props, are pretty much just scraps, bits and pieces of discarded materials. These little benches are my own rendition of props that appeared in a 1926 movie titled "Made for Love". The eyes open and close. This one turns the head. This one bows. These two operate the arms. And these two operate the legs. The story behind "Maxine the Maidmer" in the video. The idea for her was directly influenced by one of many, many favourite movies. The 1960 film titled "Night Tide", about a girl who does a fake mermaid underwater performance... ...in a carinval there on the pier. When I was a kid, early teens, there was this one woman who I didn't like. And her name was Maxine. She was an older woman, kind of snippy. Well, I didn't like Maxine, but I liked the name. So, I made the name likable by naming a character that's likable to me - I made her myself. So, I made a nice character for the nice name "Maxine". When she is behind the curtain and the curtain starts to rise... ...two feet would be visible standing on the floor. And then they would life out of visual range, and then the curtain would continue to rise... ...to show her leg where it is now. Since this leg only moves at the knee. This is Maxine's half double stand-in. Another part of Maxine. And this was made as a copy... ...so that she could put her head through the curtain, before the opening of the curtain. So her head would appear and then her eye would move back and forth. This will be parts to the audience that are viewing Maxine on the stage. So, only their upper bodies will be in the video. Here will be cameraman Sam, and he will be filming Maxine on the stage. There'll be these five characters on this side of the cameraman... ...and then five other characters on this side. And then, behind these five... ...there'll be four behind these to make it look like a full house. The eye sockets are empty because each one will have two sets of eyes. One will be small, and another will be larger. Their eyes will pop out for a certain scene in Maxine's video. And this is a version of Buster Keaton. And this is a version of Dorothy Burgess. And this one is kind of like a all-purpose leopard. And the sailor could be any sailor. Cardboard, styrofoam, wood, plaster, paint, some are made with wires. OK, this was printed to practice on a laptop computer. Just for fun as an addition to the title boards in Maxine's video. Maxine the Maidmer. It was just kinda like "bait" to reel her in. To be a part of Dr. Caligari's carnival show. The only part that was meant to be legible was just the word "CONTRACT". And then words that didn't need to be legible underneath it. Just to have an appearance as an actual contract. And just for fun I typed in all the rules... ...and regulations that an imaginary company demanded of the actress in a contract. When I first discovered silent movies, the earliest movies I began watching were D. W. Griffith movies. The early ones when he was working for "American Biograph". In those early days, American Biograph used their initials placed in their films... ...as kind of a symbol for copyright. And so, somewhere in the sets, the indoor sets,... ...there'd be their American Biograph "AB" symbol. Instead of "AB" for "American Biograph", which was theirs... ...this one is a reversed "R" for Roger, that's my first name, and "B" for Ball, my second name. I think this is something that will consume my years ahead. Movies that I like I watch many times. Just trying to figure out what the cameraman is doing and how. And appreciating some techniques, and getting an idea maybe they could have done it better a different way if they weren't on time, schedule or budget. I watch movies over again, just to concentrate on what's going on in the background, back scenery. I like in the old movies that there is the hand painted sets. And, once again. Trying to make focus, getting an idea of just what the director is doing, and how he's doing it. But then, at the same time, I figure out the editing, too. You know, editing, how it's done. And even movies that I don't like initially I'll watch again just to get a second opinion. But favorite movies I watch over and over and over again.
