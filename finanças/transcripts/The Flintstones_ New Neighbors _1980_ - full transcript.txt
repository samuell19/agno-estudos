[intense music] [thunder crashing] [upbeat music] But don't forget, Fred tomorrow's the big bowling league playoffs. Hey, y-you think Wilma will let you out of the house? Listen, Barney, a man's house is his castle and I am king in my castle. Yeah, I know. I heard Wilma say she'd crown you if you tried to sneak out. [chuckling] Very funny. Hey, hey, look, Fred, somebody's movin' a house. Shee. Where do you suppose they're movin' it to? - The city dump? - Could be. (Barney) 'Oh, I never saw such a spooky-lookin' house.'

[babbling] [chuckling] [barking] slurp Wilma, I swear, one of these days it's gonna be Dino or me. [wailing] Oh, cut it out, Dino. I was only kiddin'. slurp Honest, Wilma, vultures and bats. And a dark rain cloud over the roof. They had to be takin' it to the city dump. chomp chomp chomp Vultures and bats? Who'd wanna live in a house like that? (Fred) 'Beats me. Well, whoever it is, I wouldn't want to know them.' [knock on door] Hey, Fred. Open up! Open up! Wilma, you poor dear. I'm so sorry. - About what? - Yeah, what do you mean? Oh, bad news, Fred. Look out the window. - Fred! - No. Tell me it isn't true. (Wilma) 'That looks like the creepy house' 'you were tellin' me about.' (Fred) 'They must have bought the lot next door.' - Who? - 'Who?' The creeps who'd live in a creepy house like that. - That's who. - Oh, cheer up, Fred. - It could have been worse. - Huh? How? They could've moved next door to me. [chuckling] That's not funny, Barn. You're in trouble too. This whole block is in trouble. Uh, why? With a crummy house like that in the neighborhood you know what's gonna happen to the value of your property? - 'Uh, no.' - Pfft! Right down a drain. Pfft! "Right down a drain?" Look, the front door is opening. [door creaks] (Fred) 'Wow! What the heck is that?' It looks like a milk bottle with a note in it. I know that! I mean the hand. The giant, hairy hand. Look, there it is again. (Barney) 'Uh, y-yeah, yeah, it's pullin' in the clothesline.' (Wilma) 'A shirt with four sleeves? I don't believe it.' (Betty) 'Would you believe a two-neck sweater?' (Barney) 'Or a pair of pants with four legs?' Freaks! That's what's livin' next door to us. - Side-show freaks! - 'Uh, you're lucky, Fred.' 'You won't have to pay to see them.' All you gotta do is look out the window. [laughing] Keep that up, Barn, and in about two seconds you're goin' out the window. Oh, I-I don't think I'd like that, Fred. My mind's made up, I'm gonna do somethin' about this. - Like what? - 'Well, I don't know yet.' But I'll think of somethin'. (Barney) 'Either that or you could move.' (Fred) 'Oh, no. Not Fred Flintstone.' Nothing's gonna budge me from this spot. [laughing] [screams] [chuckling] You can come up now, budge-y. It's one of them vultures from next door. [chuckling] (Wilma) 'I don't care what you think, Fred.' 'We always pay a welcome call' 'to someone who moves into the neighborhood.' 'And these people live right next door.' There's gotta be a zone violation about keepin' vultures for pets. I'm gonna look in to that first thing in the mornin'. Come on, Fred, smile. - Make them feel welcome. - 'Ahh.' I'm only comin' along to see who lives in this spook joint. - Ready? - Yeah. [screaming] Uh, we're the Flintstones. - Your next-door neighbors. - Oh. How nice of you to call! Come in, come in. (Wilma) Thank you. Please, Mr. Flintstone, do come in. Yeah, yeah, thanks. Come on, Pebbles. Oblivia, my dear, our neighbors have come to call. Oh, how delightful. I'm making curtains for the window. Don't you just love them? My dear, these are the Flintstones. Oh, what a charming family. We're the Frankenstones. Uh, we're Wilma, Fred and Pebbles. So nice to meet you, Pebbles. - That's Pebbles. - Oh, I'm so sorry. Please forgive me, Wilma. - She's Wilma. - 'Oh, dear.' 'I'm so terrible with names.' Uh, here's a little gift for the house. (Oblivia) 'Oh, thank you.' Please, folks, won't you sit down? Love to. But we ain't stayin' long. We adore this lovely neighborhood, Mrs. Flintstone. Yes, indeed. It's so quiet and peaceful here. And we intend to keep it that way. Quiet and peaceful. [eerie music on stereo] [screams] W-w-what's that? Oh, it's our daughter. Playing her favorite album. "Cemetery Serenade." - A lovely tune. - Oh, Hidea. Please turn off your stereo. We have company. Hidea, darling, these lovely people live next door. 'Mrs. Flintstone and Pebbles.' Hello, Hidea. (Frank) 'And this is Mr. Flintstone.' - How are you? - How do you do, ma'am, sir? 'And how are you, Pebbles?' [cooing] [chuckling] Oh, she's adorable. (Oblivia) 'Mrs. Flintstone, is there a good orthodontist in Bedrock?' Why, yes. We've got to do something about Hidea's teeth. 'They're so straight and even.' [wailing] Mother, why must you talk about it in front of strangers? [wailing] She's right, my dear. You know how sensitive she is. Frank, darling shouldn't we offer our guests some refreshments? (Frank) Oh, of course. Oh, Rockell, will you please serve some canapes? [growling] - Oh, what's that? - Our maid. She's such a gem. [instrumental music] (Frank) 'Oh. Rockell's piece de resistance.' 'Sauteed scorpion on a cracker.' [hisses] (Frank) 'Have a bite, Mr. Flintstone.' Ow! No thanks, I am not hungry. [creaks] (Frank) 'This is our son. Frankenstub.' Stubby, say hello to Mrs. Flintstone. - Hello. - Hello, Stubby. What're you doing with that shovel? Digging graves in the cellar. Digging graves in-in-in the, the, the cellar? [chuckling] Well, it keeps him in the house, you know. [instrumental music] [barking] [cooing] - Oh, you have a dog? - Yes. Our octo-pup. We call him Creepy. [barking] Oh, no. Down, boy, down. Wilma! Help! [chuckling] Oh, my goodness. You certainly have a way with animals, Mr. Flintstone. Indeed. 'Creepy isn't usually friendly to strangers.' [barking] [kissing] That's it, Wilma, we're leavin'. [instrumental music] Did you see the bolts in this neck? And how about that kid diggin' graves in a cellar? I'm tellin' you, Wilma-- Oh, look, Fred, it's Betty and Barney. - Hello, Wilma. - Uh, hiya, Fred. Uh, we were gonna introduce ourselves to your new neighbors. Take my advice, Barn, and turn back. - That place is a nuthouse. - 'Oh, no way, Fred.' - We're dyin' to meet 'em. - Dyin' to meet 'em, huh? [scoffs] Try thesauteed scorpion. - Oh, Fred, give them a chance. - No way. They're gonna give this neighborhood a bad reputation. Fred, you're being ridiculous. I said I was gonna do somethin', and now I'm gonna do it. [thunder crashing] [tires screeching] Step on it, Barn, we'll be late for work. Uh, mornin', Fred. Well, another day, another dollar, right? Yeah, right. [yawning] Boy, that was some big yawn. I got up an hour earlier than usual. (Fred) I had a little chore to do. Heh-heh-heh. Uh, hey, Fred, did you look at that? Oh, that's awful. Huh? What? Where? What? What? Look at what? Tha-tha-that sign, right there. '"This way to the freak show."' - Oh, yeah, I see it. - Uh-h, stop the car, Fred. 'Let's pull it down.' Oh, I-I can't stop now, Barn. Mr. Slate will chew me out if I'm late. Gee, that's gonna embarrass the Frankenstones. Only a lame brain would put up a sign like that. I wouldn't say that. The Frankenstones have got to expect that sort of thing. Why? They're nice folks. They're not folks, they're freaks! Well, they may be kind of weird but they're very friendly people. Uh, Betty and I like 'em a lot. And all I can say is you and Betty ought to be more choosy about who you like. (Barney) 'Hey, hey, what's that smeared on your finger?' - 'Is that red paint?' - 'Huh?' Eh, no! No, no, no! No, it's, uh, it's ink. I, uh, I was writin' letters this mornin'. Fred, did you paint that sign? 'Me? There you go again changin' the subject.' We were talkin' about the Frankenstones. - And I said I like 'em. - And I don't. So you're gonna have to decide who you're gonna be friends with. I don't like nobody to tell me who to like and who not to like. And I don't like people playin' low-down tricks on their neighbors. So I'm choosin' the Frankenstones. Well, you can have 'em, and don't ever speak to me again. [coughing] (Wilma) 'Fred, wake up. It's Washingstone's birthday.' [mumbles] We're gonna be late for our picnic with the Rubbles. Forget it, Wilma, we're skippin' the picnic this year. - What? - You heard me. I have no intentions of socializing with those weirdo-lovin' Rubbles. 'We'll have our picnic in our own backyard.' No way, Fred. I wanna get away from the house. I wanna go with the Rubbles to Mount Rockliff where there's clean, fresh air. Sorry, Wilma, but we're not goin' to Mount Rockliff. [wailing] Well, you wanna explain to Pebbles? Ah, alright, we'll go, Pebbles. [cooing] [chuckling] But we're goin' on a picnic by ourselves. No fraternizing with the enemy. [instrumental music] Good thing we brought enough food. The boys will be hungry after their game. I'm hungry now! Uh, play ball. Here it comes, Stubby right over the plate. That's some long-laid picnic they're having, Fred. Yeah, but who are they having it with? [scoffs] The Frankenstones. - Ready? - Ready, dad. thud thud thud [barking] screech [applauding] Nice catch. Yeah, way to go, Creepy pup. Hah! Baseball. That's their idea of fun. Yeah, too bad they're not enjoying themselves like us. You're a barrel of laughs. Well, I'm enjoyin' myself. Here, pass me the custard. Oh, dear. A foul ball. (Barney) 'Hey, hey, hey, Fred. Watch out.' splash [laughing] Oh, Fred, you look so ridiculous. [laughing] Oh, sorry about that, Fred, it was an accident. Oh, yeah? You wanna see an accident? I'll show you a real accident. - 'Barney didn't do it, Fred.' - Don't tell me that. He's been waitin' for a chance to pull somethin' like this on me. Fred, now you are being ridiculous. (Frank) 'I assure you, Mr. Flintstone' 'it was an accidental foul ball.' (Fred) 'Huh! Accidental on purpose.' Frankenstone, you movin' in was an accident. An accident for the whole neighborhood. - Fred, stop it. - I won't stop it. (Wilma) 'Please, don't take him seriously, Mr. Frankenstone.' 'When Fred gets upset' 'he says things he's sorry for later.' Bamm-Bamm! Bamm-Bamm! Bamm-Bamm! - What is it, Bamm-Bamm? - Bamm-Bamm! Oh, my gosh. My baby. [instrumental music] Whoo! [chuckling] (Wilma) 'Oh, my goodness.' (Fred) 'She landed in that pterodactyl's nest.' (Betty) Thank goodness. It broke her fall. Fred, we've got to get her out of there. I know, I know, but how? (Frank) 'I have an idea.' - Hurry, we'll take my car. - Okay, okay. [instrumental music] Wait, Fred. Wait for us. (Betty) 'Too late. We'll have to run down.' [cooing] [squawking] [cooing] [squawking] [chuckling] [squawking] We'll form a human ladder. - First you, Mr. Rubbles. - I'm with you. Alley-oop! Now, you climb on to his shoulders, Mr. Flintstone. - Huh? - Creepy, help him. [barking] Thanks, Creepy. I can't reach her, she's too high. How's that? [grunts] Still not enough. I gotta get higher. Dada. Yeah, honey, it's daddy. Don't worry, I'll get you down. [squawking] Fred, the mother pterodactyl is coming back to her nest. - 'Watch out!' - The mother? - Oh, no. - Don't move. Maybe she won't notice us. E-everybody, freeze. Pebbles, baby, sit still, don't move. [squawking] [sighs] [chuckling] [cooing] Dada. Dada. Dada. Oh, boy. Whoa! Oh. - Oh, help! - Me too! [chuckling] The mother bird thinks Pebbles is one of her chicks. Now what will we do? [squawking] We've got to lure her away from her nest. Long enough for us to get Pebbles down. - But how? - H-hey, Fred, I know how. H-h-hey, Mrs. Dactyl? Look what I got. Up here, chicky, chicky, chicky. 'Here, chicky, chicky, chicky.' [squawking] Squawk, squawk, squawk. Squawk, squawk, squawk. [squawking] - She's following him. - Good ol' Barn. What a guy! We've got to work fast, Mr. Flintstone. - Wait here. - Alright. We're comin', Pebbles, just sit tight. Eh? What are you doin'? You just get Pebbles. - I'll take care of the rest. - Good thinkin'. (Wilma) 'Fred, be careful.' Don't worry, he's in good hands. [squawking] Hiya, Mr. Rubble. Hey, uh, what're you kids doin' in here? We're hiding from that nasty pterodactyl. Uh, well, keep hidin'. Here she comes. 'I-I'll try to lose her in that tunnel.' Hey, kids. I think we lost her. Hey, hey, hey. Cut that out. S-stop it. Choo! Choo! G-go away! He-hey! Dada. Oh, Dada. Easy, Pebbles, here comes daddy. Gotcha. [squawking] [squawking] Oh, Pebbles, darling, you're safe. [chuckling] Yeah, my little Pebbles. [squawking] (Fred) 'It's the ma bird again.' Oh, dear, she thinks Pebbles is her baby and that we're stealing her. We gotta get out of here. Quick, hop in. - Hurry, Frank. - I'm hurrying, Oblivia. [squawking] Mama! Mama! Mama! Mama! [screaming] [screeches] I'm glad you're all here in my house 'cause I got somethin' to say. Oh, like what, Fred? Well, Barney, first, I wanna take back all the dumb things I said about you. Oh, shucks, Fred, you don't have to. Barn, anyone who'd risk his life for my little Pebbles is a true-blue pal. And, Mr. Frankenstone, please accept my apology. For what, Mr. Flintstone? For the way I behaved. For my stupidness. Fred, I wouldn't call it stupidness. No? What would you call it? Stupidity. [chuckling] Yeah, my stupidity. If anyone acted stupid, it was me. I'm sorry, I apologize. Really, Mr. Flintstone, it isn't necessary. And please, call me Fred. And call me Frank. And call me Barney. [chuckling] [screeching] Ah! What's happening? (Fred) 'I don't know. Maybe it's an earthquake.' It's the mama pterodactyl. (Fred) 'What's the matter with her? Why is she so mad?' What did you do with the egg, Mr. Rubble? (Barney) 'Eh, it's in the car.' [cawing] thud Look, she came here for her baby. (Betty) 'And she's taking her home.' (Fred) 'Home, what a nice place to be.' My beautiful wife and child, my great old pals, the Rubbles and for my wonderful new neighbors, the Frankenstones all I can say is yabba-dabba-doo! Ya-ba da-ba doo? I like that. [theme music]
