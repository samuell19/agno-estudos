Hey Tasha, do you want to go to the playground? We've been sitting here all day. So? Let's go inside and play on my Game Boy. No Bernie, I just wanna sit here. Look at what we got here. Let me see this. Give it back! Give it back to him! Go home and cry to your sickly mother! Don't you ever say that again! Tasha! Come here. Come all the way here, baby. What's wrong? Nothing. What happened? You and Bernie get mad at each other again? I see, somebody bothered you? Who was it? It was William. He was being mean. William? Oh girl, that boy ain't nothing but trouble. I'll go handle this. Uh Mama, lay back down. No, I can't have that, baby. I guess as much as I wanna get up I can't, baby. I... I just can't. It's okay, Mama. Go on stand in the middle of the floor. Go on. Now what? All right, I want you to ball your fists up as tightly as you can, and I want you to spin 'em around like a windmill. Huh? You know, like the big windmills we see on the farm. Why? Because when something or somebody bothers you, sweetie, you gotta fight back. I'm not always gonna be around to defend you. No, uh uh. Don't do that. Pick your head up. All right? Now on the count of three, I want you to spin your arms as wild as you can until you knock 'em down, okay? - Mm-hmm. - One, two, three. Spin 'em Tasha, there you go, there you go, baby. I'm dizzy. All right, come here. Get up here with me. You see Tasha, strength isn't just physical, it's mental and emotional too. And I need you to be strong. All right? You understand? You promise? Promise.

Anyway, uh, me and Tony we gotta go lay a carpet at that new office complex on Blakely Road. It's not that far. I should be back in time to head out to your dad's for dinner. Is that tonight? Your birthday on another night we don't know about? No, it's just, you know I was just trying to think if maybe we could skip all the dramatics and just spend a nice quiet evening just the two of us. Like he's going to allow that. Melvin ain't the boss of me. No, he's just the boss of your birthday. - Hmm, he is isn't he? - Hmm. Fine. You know, I'm going back to sleep for ten more minutes then.

That's so thoughtful. Ew! Kids, if-- If you could excuse me for a moment, Take your seats. Take your seats. Okay. You know I threw up in front of the kids and grossed them out today? Yes, yes you told me several times. I got my usual morning coffee but... maybe the milk was sour. Yeah, maybe and you told me that too, look. We just stay a little while then we leave, all right? Hour tops. You promise? Yeah, I'm not trying to stay here all night. Come on, let's get this out of the way. Why is it so dark in here, man. It's nighttime. Turn the lights on. Surprise! There's my birthday girl. Were you surprised? Surprised is an understatement, Daddy. You really didn't have to go through all this trouble. It was Brenda's idea. Melvin get that camera out of her face, the girl just got here. Happy 30th birthday, Tasha. Thank you so much, Brenda. Somebody make Tasha a plate. She's the birthday girl. She gets served first. And put a heap of my mac 'n' cheese on there, not Carol's. You don't want any of Carol's mac 'n' cheese, she don't use the right cheeses or seasonings, and I don't even know why she brought it when she knows mine is the best. Oh, trust me, I don't need a heap of anything tonight, okay? Of course you do, look at you, you're skin and bones. What you have against hips I'll never know. Wait are you serious, have you seen my, mmm. Okay, well put it there. Uhhh, uhhh. One more. Uhhh. - All right now. - All right now. Wow what a spread we got tonight, huh? Hi. Everybody come on in here and get some food. Okay, 'cause after this we're gonna watch Tasha's birth video. No, Daddy not tonight. Please, can we skip the birth video this year? You talking crazy. We watch that video every year since you was born. But we can skip this year. How about-- Help me. Hi everybody. Daddy, we really gotta upgrade you on that camera. It's the best investment that I ever made this camera. VHS? Get that God damn camera out of my face and help me you idiot. - Screw you! Oh my God. Baby, hey, Tasha. - Baby, hey, hey. - What happened? Could somebody get some water? Tasha? - Hey listen. - Hmm. - Um... - What? I think you should take one of those home pregnancy tests. Oh, Bernie. Honey for what? Seven years of being told that my eggs aren't fertile? Bernie, a baby isn't possible for us. Well, babe I get all that, but look... You threw up at school, you passed out at the party and your cycle is late. Isn't that what happen to a woman when she's pregnant? It's impossible. Okay, how late are you? - Two weeks. - See, two-- Come on. - What? - Just take the test, baby. Honey, if I am pregnant, I need a doctor to confirm it. Honey, listen it's almost time for my annual exam, I'll just get the full work up, okay? - Yeah? - That work? - That works. - Good. Good, all right. Get some rest. Okay, fine so let's play what if. Are you ready? Do I have a choice. - No. Okay. - Okay. What if, by some divine intervention, I am pregnant? - Hmm. - Mm-hmm. Would you want a baby boy or a baby girl? Well... Yeah, I don't know. It doesn't really matter. I just want a healthy baby. Boy, stop playing. You know you want a boy. You know you want a baby boy. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, I admit I would... have a little more in common with a boy. Mm-hmm, just a little. Just a little bit. - If he was anything like me he'd have that throwing arm. - Mm-hmm. I'd train him all the way up to the NFL. Aww. And he could buy us a big house in the Hamptons. Where all the rich people live. We could go to all the dinner parties, and sip on our wine, and um... I would develop an accent, and I would go around saying things like um... "Lovely weather we're having, darling." Right, right? "How do you do? How do you do? How is the weather; Crisp and clean and fresh?" - Right. - You see I talk well? Yeah, yeah you gonna talk like that? You gonna have to do that on the other side of the room. Oh. And you don't drink wine so... - I bet I would start. - Right. When you're paying a hundred dollars a bottle, or a sip? - Shoot. Okay so, what if we had a girl. Oh, a baby girl? She'd be so cute. Yeah. I don't know maybe she would become president. Yes. And bring about world peace. I like that. - You like that? - Mm-hmm. Mmm. Oh. Namaste. I'm pretty sure your using that word in the wrong context. I told you I just like saying it, joy stealer. All right, you keep saying it. Say it real low 'cause I'm going to sleep. Stop. - Go to bed lady, goodness. - Whatever. Well Tasha, we're all done with your annual physical, we have your blood work, but because of your family's history with breast cancer... Ah, let me guess, you need me to go to radiology next door for my mammogram? Precisely. I've been getting mammograms for the past five years Doctor Bailey, I know the routine. But those machines, oh my God, they are so uncomfortable. I know that mammograms can be uncomfortable, but because you carry the mutated gene for breast cancer, it's really important that you get your checkups at this early age. Understood. But what if I am pregnant? I mean is it okay for me to get a mammogram right now? With all that radiation, it's just-- I don't-- Normally, mammograms are safe during pregnancy because the amount of radiation is minimal. But Tasha, I don't want you getting your hopes up. Your chances are less than five percent of becoming pregnant. Your eggs just aren't fertile. I got it. I know. Are you gonna be okay? I will be. Okay well, get dressed and we'll talk soon okay? Thank you, Doctor Bailey. So we get the carpet out, ready to install it, and I unroll it and I see all these cuts, all through the whole roll, a whole bunch of cuts on the carpet. Yeah, it was completely ruined. Couldn't use any of it. The customer was unsatisfied, of course, for obvious reasons. And it set me and Tony back two days, we'll have to get new carpet and still have it installed on time. - Hmm. - It's crazy. Tasha? Baby? What's up? Have you listened to a word I said? Yeah, you said, "carpet, slices, pushback." Right. It's this funny thing about me though, you know, it's like when I talk to someone, I like when they interact with me, so. - Honey, I'm sorry. - Hmm. I don't know. I've just been having so much on my mind and of course I'm tired, I don't know what's going on with me. Well, thinking about the test results is not gonna make the phone ring any faster. Yeah. Well, it did make something ring now didn't it? - Mm, mm, mm. - Yeah, you're funny. Not really. - Be right back. - Mm-hmm. We have a guest. Hey. Just thought I'd come by and see how she was doing. Oh, I'm doing good Daddy, much better. How you doing, young man? I'm good man, we just having dinner. Good. 'Cause I am hungry. Oh, I'll get you a bowl. So, Bernie informed me that the other night you got some really great video footage. - I always get good video footage. - Mm-hmm. Well, she says that she can't stand the fact that you always gotta video tape everything. I don't video everything. I just video the important stuff. So, me passing out at my party was important? Well, yeah. Daddy, come on, that is embarrassing. Don't show that video to anyone. When you say anyone, you mean what? Anyone. Fine. But one day, you're gonna look back at that footage and you gonna appreciate it. And then you gonna realize why I video everything. Because life is precious, baby, and I capture those moments so that you have something to hold onto. You even hold onto your mothers memory because of it. Yes, Daddy, and I do appreciate it, but video of me fainting needs to be destroyed. Have you gone to the doctor to find out why you passed out? Yes, and we're waiting on the results. Well, Brenda and I think it's because you don't eat right. You seriously gonna start that tonight? Well, just look at this for example, huh? I mean, what is this okay, this "egg poo young" nonsense? It's egg foo yong, Melvin. "Poo young". Whatever it is, okay? It's not a wholesome meal. You know what you need to do, right? Take some cooking classes. Exactly. Excuse me? I didn't say nothing. You didn't marry me for my cooking, now did you? Mm. No ma'am I did not. Excuse me, I ain't trying to hear all that now, all right? What, Daddy? That we have sex? Tasha. ♪ Let's get it on ♪ I tried to have that talk with you when you was a little girl. That talk with you about sex? You didn't want to hear nothing about it. Now look at you. Tasha. Tasha. Yeah? I want to talk to you for a minute. Brenda suggested that maybe you stay home today. You know since you, well you know, started menstruation. God Dad, don't say that out loud. I'm sorry, okay? I don't know all the rules. Um, did she teach you about those little pads? Please let this to be the end of the talk. Or my life. Do you want me to take you to the store? Do you need something? No. So, do you have any questions? No. Tasha, you know, since you are becoming a woman as of today, I don't know, I thought maybe you might have a few questions. Questions about what? What do you know about sex? I'm not having this talk with you. Yes you are, okay. Your mother is not here, okay so, who else are you gonna talk to about it but me? Dad. Look Tasha, I am serious about this okay? When I was a kid, no one told me anything about sex. Everything I learned about sex was from a song called "Let's Get It On." Hmm. Have to look that one up. No you don't. Look many years from now... maybe when you're 60 or so, you know you're gonna wanna have sex. 60 dad? Come on. All right, 40, 45, something like that. I'm not waiting that long, and let me save us both from this devastation. I've already had sex ed at school. I know about sex, the vagina, penis, egg, and sperm. Sexually transmitted diseases, all that. - Okay, but there's more-- - But nothing, Dad. Stop stressing. I'm gonna wait till I get married to have sex. I want to have a beautiful wedding, just like you and Mom had. I want a house full of children, five. Five? And I have their names picked out too. Patricia, after Mom of course. Candice, so I can nickname her Candy. Oh wait, that sounds like a stripper name. Scratch that one. And Alfonzo is gonna be amazing. Okay. I see you have this all planned out, all right? We don't have to go through every single detail. Great. Now I gotta go to school. Good talk, huh? I hope. Great work, Zinobia. All right class, I need to return a quick call, but I will be right at the door if you need me. You may talk. Quietly. Hello? Yes, this is Tasha Jackson returning your call. Okay, so my results aren't in? Oh, they are? Well, why can't you just give them to me over the phone? Oh, of course my husband and I will be there if Dr. Bailey insists. I apologize for the delay. It's all right. Mr. and Mrs. Jackson, Tasha's results are in but I wanted to speak with you personally because her results are well, delicate in nature. What is it, Doctor? I thought about how to tell you this but there's only one way to say it so, I'm just gonna come out with it. You have defied the odds, Tasha. You're pregnant. - Oh my God! - Are you serious? Oh my God! Oh, Bernie. Are you serious? Nine weeks along. A baby. Wow. But a mass was found on your mammogram. - Wait. - What? Wait no, no, no. I've been getting my mammogram for years, and my results have always been clean. I know, and I'm sorry, but unfortunately this result was not. Whoa hold on a second, wait. Just so I can understand you clearly, are you saying my wife has breast cancer? No, I'm not saying that at all. A biopsy will have to be preformed to determine that. What I'm saying is that Tasha has a mass, and as you both already know she carries a mutated gene. The BRCA1 she inherited from her mother. This mutation causes a greater risk of developing breast cancer. Okay, but... but, she can get the biopsy back and find out the mass isn't cancerous, and she and the baby will be fine, right? Yes, of course. The mass can be benign. And what if it isn't? If it's malignant, then your oncologist will talk to you about the next steps. No, no, Doc, you could just tell us right now. You're a doctor, you have an idea of what'll happen. Please. I'm sorry I... Listen, we've been wanting this baby for a long time. Yes. Right, we've been through too much so just, just tell us. Okay normally, in a case such as this, with the pregnancy in it's early stages, if the mass is indeed malignant, depending on the stage that it's in, then your oncologist might suggest that you terminate the pregnancy and receive treatment immediately. Terminate the pregnancy? God. Bernie. Tasha. If it's between you and this baby... I mean, it's no... real choice in the matter, you know? Are you serious? Just, we have options. Right? Tasha let me order the biopsy and let's look at the results before you get yourself upset. I mean, in your condition it is very important that you remain calm. Oh God, I can't. Tasha, baby. I can't! Thank you. Tasha. Tasha. Don't you speak to me. Wait, don't use that teacher voice on me. How dare you say that if it's between me and the baby there's no other choice? My body, my choice. Hey, wait a second, you're my wife, okay? - I have a say in this. - No, you don't, Bernie. Yes, I do, Tasha! I do have a say! Okay? Why is this happening to me? Why is this happening to us? Listen. What? Let's not do this to each other. Not right now. The biopsy could come back benign and everything will be okay. All right? - Okay. - Okay. - Come on. - I'm sorry, Bernie. No, that's okay, come on. It's gonna be all right. Daddy. It's malignant. Damn it. My baby, my baby, my baby. When I had that biopsy done, I just knew that everything was gonna be okay. But the oncologist said that I have... I have invasive ductal carcinoma stage two. It's an aggressive form of breast cancer. I know. It's what your mother had, stage four. Yeah so, Melvin, Brenda will you please help me talk some sense into her? Please? The oncologist said that we should terminate the pregnancy now so that she can start her treatment. Terminate the pregnancy? Yes. This is our baby, Bernie. How many times do I have to remind you of that? That's our baby. Tasha honey, this is your life. Yes. Yes. This is my life. Mine. Who around this table understands that? What is there to understand? Huh? The oncologist said that her cancer's treatable if we start now, Tasha. Did you ask the doctor what would happen if she's waits till after the pregnancy? Yeah, and if she waits until the baby is born, then the cancer could grow and it may be too late to do anything about it. Tasha, baby, what do you want to do? I want to have our baby. Look, whatever time I have left on this earth I would rather spend it having a baby to love, than without one. Daddy, this is a miracle. This baby is a gift from God. What part about that don't you understand, Bernie? You know what, I'm not gonna sit here and listen to this. So what, you're just gonna walk away? You're just gonna walk away? Let him go. He has a lot to process. Trust me, I know. The thought about losing the only woman that you've ever loved... It's a lot to deal with. So what? You two gonna gang up on me too? Is that it? We're not gonna gang up on you, Tasha, but if your doctor is urging you to terminate the pregnancy, then you need to listen to him. I seen what this disease can do first hand and baby, I don't wish that on you. Hey, come here. Come over here with us. My girls. ♪ And I try to care from an angel made for me ♪ ♪ Made for me ♪ ♪ Made for me ♪ ♪ Made for me ♪ Patricia. Patricia. Tasha, call 911 like we practiced, come on. Tasha, now! Patricia. Even though I saw how much pain this disease caused her, I was equally hurt that you had to grow up without her guidance. Hey Tashy, you wanna come out and get something to eat? I know you must be hungry. I'm not hungry. You sure? You know, Tasha you can talk to me about anything. Just like your momma did. I mean, I wasn't her best friend for nothing. Okay. I'm here if you need me. Hey, Tasha. Hey, Bernie. Your mommy's gone to Heaven, huh? My dog Split went to heaven too, guess it's a good place. That's what they say in church. Remember the day of the funeral? How could I forget? Yeah. Heard your mom kicked the bucket, shrimp. When I pulled you out of that fight... Tasha, stop! Tasha, I said stop! ...I knew right then and there, I could only do so much for you. You really need to think about the possibility of this child growing up without you. Now come on, Daddy's gonna take you home. I mean one minute we can't have any kids. The next minute... You know? It's all so much all of a sudden, man. Yeah, I know. I mean, I can't pretend I never wanted children, you know? Hmm. But when we found out Tasha couldn't have any, I was cool with that, you know. I wasn't going anywhere. I love her. Yeah, I get it. I don't want this baby, Tony. It might not be right but, that's how I feel. You'll come around. I doubt it. - She needs you man. - Mm-mm. Bro, she don't need me. She got it all figured out. She's so damn stubborn. Yeah. I tucked her in just like I did when she was little. She was spent. I'm sure. I can't believe this is happening. Not to her. Can I get a cup of tea? What? You mad at me? I don't know, am I? What does-- What's that supposed to mean. It means... When will I be enough for you, Melvin? I don't know what the hell you talking about. All these years I've been here, I feel like I'm invisible to you. Invisible? You're standing right in front of me. Do you see me? 'Cause I feel like I'm standing in Patricia's shadow. Nothing I do is ever good enough for you. Not when I helped you take care of my best friend until her death. Not even when I helped you raise Tasha while I'm raising my own boys. Not once have I ever felt appreciated. We're in a relationship Brenda, that's not enough for you? No, it's not. Then what do you want from me, huh? A thank you? Do you love me? My only child just walked in here and told me she has breast cancer and she's foregoing treatment for a child she may never raise. Every bit of love, every bit of support, every bit of strength, everything I have in me is going to my daughter. You either accept that, or not. I'm going to bed. Tasha baby, please open the door. Tasha's in the bathroom, she won't come out. I didn't know what to do so I called you. It's fine. She's 12 years old. If she's not coming out of the bathroom it's for one reason. Sanitary napkins. She's crossed over into womanhood. How could I not know that? Don't beat yourself up about it. Tasha honey, it's Brenda. Can I come in? I'll be in the kitchen. It'll be fine. Yeah. She's growing up. Best to let her stay home from school today. Experiencing that for the first time can be a little traumatic. Thank you, Brenda. Mm-hmm. No problem. You know, with Patricia gone I just feel as though there's so much she's missing out on that I can't give to her. Well, I'm not her mother, but I'm always here to help you with her. I don't want to burden you. It's no burden. I can help her. And you. - I can't. - Yes, you can. Melvin. You're a man with needs. I'm a woman with the same needs. My needs are taken care of just fine. Oh, I see. So, you can be with other women, just not me. Is that it? Brenda, it's not easy for you and me. You were her best friend. It's been four years. You think I don't know that? She's gone Melvin, and I'm here, and I love you. And that little girl upstairs, - I love her like she's my own. - I know that. Then why? I just-- Look I just can't, okay? Can't is not a reason. Why don't you just consider the fact that-- Look, I'm still in love with my wife, okay? Look, I don't want to hurt you, Brenda. I took care of her when that cancer was just eating her away. I did everything I could to keep her here. Because Tasha needed her mother. I took care of her too. I was right there with you. So you expect me to just make love to her best friend? Yes. You just don't understand. I can't betray Patricia like that. You can't betray a dead woman. I didn't mean that. I'm sorry. Look, I know she's dead, okay? And she's not coming back. And you're a beautiful woman. Any man would be lucky to have you. But I'm not gonna sit here and pretend that I want any more from you than friendship. I don't need anymore friends. I can't do this anymore. Brenda, don't leave. Tasha needs you. If only you needed me too. Hey. Hey. I have a sonogram appointment this morning. You think you could make it? Um, yeah, I don't think so babe. I don't think I can. Could you try? I gotta work. All right. Okay, thanks for telling me. Okay. That was Tasha. She has a sonogram this morning. What? You still not talking to me? For what? I don't have anything to say. Then don't say anything. We just uh... make up. Aren't we a little too old for make up sex? I don't know. Tell me when we're finished. The gel is warm. Okay. Oh. All right, here we go. There. It looks like a little kidney bean. Yes, that's what it's supposed to look like at this gestation. Wow. Well, is everything okay, is the heart beating? Heart beat is strong. You're about 11 weeks along. Miss Jackson, are you okay? I wish my husband was here is all. We'll print a picture out for him. No one wants to do the first... ya know, sonogram alone, you know? Oh yeah, I understand. Did we miss it? Oh my God, you're here? Oh, Brenda and Daddy. Oh, here you go. We would have been here earlier but um-- Traffic. - Yeah. - We were caught in traffic. Yeah, caught in traffic, good traffic-- I mean, big traffic. Yeah. Okay? All right, let's fire this thing up so I can see this baby. Oh, yeah, sure thing. Oh, yeah. Look, I got the baby on film before it's even here! I know. It's so tiny. Okay, here goes nothing. Hello there, um... well, today has been all in all, uh... Oh my God. What the hell am I trying to say? Oh, I got it. All right, um... Hey there little person, whoever you are. My name is Tasha, Tasha Jackson and um... I recently turned 30 and um... Damn it. This thing's not even recording. Okay, okay here we go. Hello, little one. I am your mommy, Tasha, and right now you are in my tummy, see? Um, I am recording this because apparently your grandfather Melvin had it right all along. Important things should be captured on film. So here I am recording this just for you. So, I am 11 weeks pregnant with you and I also have breast cancer. Just like my mom. But I want you to know that no matter what happens, I chose you. You are loved, and I will always, always be here with you. Tasha. That's your loud daddy. Yeah? Breakfast. What's all this? What do you mean, it's breakfast. Well, I can see that, it's just your idea of breakfast is usually cereal. Yeah, well. Not today. Bernie, don't do this. Do what? Start doing all this extra unnecessary stuff. It's just breakfast, Tasha. No, it's not, it's um... "You know I think you're gonna die soon, so let me start doing this extra stuff to compensate for what I should have been doing all along." That's not fair, Tasha. Okay? I made breakfast because I wanted to. So this is the part where we start talking about what's fair? No, you don't want to have that conversation with me right now, trust me. Oh, yes I do. I do want to have this conversation. All right, let's have the conversation. How are you gonna convince me or anybody else that you're being fair to yourself and your husband by keeping this baby instead of saving your own life? Hmm? Explain to me how that's fair. I'm listening. Bernie, this is not 25 years ago when my mother had cancer. There are new treatments and medicines... You are acting as if you're about to plan my funeral. I might have to. Do you understand that, Tasha? I just might have to. God, you don't think that I'm afraid of that? I am, God knows I wanna live. Then do what needs to be done, okay? God. You are so damn stubborn and naive. And what if I lose you, huh? Hmm? What then? What do I do? I've loved you my entire life, Tasha. Oh Bernie, I am so sorry. I am so-- I am so sorry. Ok, um... Look, you ready to go? Oh my God, my feet are killing me. You're walking around campus all day and then you come here work at night, I bet your feet do hurt. Don't expect no foot rub or nothing, though. Thanks for coming all this way to pick me up. It aint nothing, you know, that's what best friends are for, right? Yes. Why am I picking you up? Because I asked you to. I know that, your dad couldn't pick you up? - I'm trying to surprise him. - Aww. Ain't that sweet. Why are you coming home now? It's not a holiday or a break or anything. Tomorrow's the anniversary of Mom's death. I don't like leaving him home alone you know? Yeah, I bet that. That's what's up. Don't act like you ain't gonna put no money in my gas tank, though. So what, you broke again? What? Girl, you got jokes. Nah, I ain't broke. I got a little something happening. Doing what? Don't look at me like that. I ain't doing nothing illegal, Tasha. Hey yo, for real, I'm not. I got a job at this carpet company. Bernie, you the dude that can barely vacuum. Well, I guess that's something we got in common then. Well, good for you then. Take care of you too, if you let me. Okay, you see Bernie that's what I'm talking about. You play too much. Brenda, hey. It's been a while. Melvin, hi. Yeah, what five years at least. Six years to be exact. What are you doing here? Well, you know a little market like this is the best place to get a good steak. It's the best market in town. I was just picking up my seasonings for my jerk chicken. Ah, your jerk chicken, yeah. I remember that. So, how's Tasha? - She's in college now. - Wow. Yeah, actually I was hoping she'd come home in a few days, for you know... Uh, but she's busy studying. Tomorrow's the anniversary of Patricia's passing. Yeah. What's going on with you? You married? You not married? What? No, no, no. Been there done that. Yeah, I remember you having a hard time with your divorce. Oh, no not really. He was a lying, manipulative, narcissistic, weak example of a man. Easy to walk away from. Damn, tell me how you really feel. Well, listen, it was good to see you Melvin. Give Tasha my love and tell her I miss her. What about me? I mean, do you miss me even a little? You were such a constant in our lives for years, and these past years without you, I really regret it. If I could go back I would-- Well it's not important. I really miss you, Brenda. I'm not Patricia, Melvin. I know that. I was never trying to take her place. I was just trying to be there in whatever capacity I could. I realize that, and I took you for granted and I'm sorry. Yes, I do miss you. Well, what are you doing tonight? Are you busy? Would you like to have dinner? Remember, I cook a mean steak. Thank you, but um... I'm gonna pass on dinner. You take care of yourself, okay? Melvin. I like my steaks rare. Okay. Cabernet? Daddy! Daddy, I'm home! Daddy! Brenda? Oh! Oh my God, I can't believe this. And on the anniversary of my mother's death? That is totally disrespectful. Well, technically it's not on the anniversary. That's tomorrow, but I mean-- To me, your dad and Brenda makes sense, you know? Really, Bernie? She was my mother's best friend. Yeah I know, but I mean... What do you mean? What do you mean? Look, it's not like he's cheating on your moms, you know? And Brenda, I mean, I'm just saying-- I'd hit it. Ow, hey come on stop hitting on me. No, not when you say dumb crap like that. Come on Tasha, are you serious? What, you think your dad's gonna go the rest of his life without gettin' some? Come on man, you need to chill out. I don't need to do anything, but go back to school right now. No. no. Right now? - Yes. - No, no. We're not going back right now, we just got here. I'm not turning around and taking you all the way back. Fine. Can I spend the night at your house then? I really don't want to got home tonight. Are you finished yet? Bernie, I told you not to look. I'm not looking, all right? I'm just tired. You know, it took me four hours to come get you and four hours to come back. Okay, I'm done. Thank you. Bernie, what are you doing? I'm not sleeping in my clothes. Oh, man. No, no, no, no, no, you sleep on the floor and I'm gonna sleep in the bed. Tasha, I am not sleeping on the floor okay? I'm tired. I just wanna get in my own bed. Ain't nobody gonna touch you girl, move. But, what if your mom comes in? She's not coming in here. She works the night shift now. Bernie? Huh? How many girls have you been with? What? Tasha, you crazy girl, go to bed. Did you love any of them? No. So, you've never been in love? Well, yeah. With who? With you. Me? You can't be in love with me. I'm your best friend. That's more the reason, right? Make love to me, then. What? Nah. What do you mean, "nah"? No. What, is there something wrong with me? No, there's nothing wrong with you I'm just... Okay, well then why not? I'm not making love to you until I marry you, okay? Marry me? Bernie you are so stupid sometimes. Oh my gosh. Marry me. No, I'm not stupid, Tasha. I'm gonna marry you one day. I'm serious. But, for right now I'm gonna get some sleep. All right? Goodnight. Come on in and take a seat. We're just getting started. Okay. Thank you. I know we are all going through a lot of emotion right now. Ranging from fear to self pity to, well, feeling less than a woman. But your focus should not be on those things. Your focus should be sharing your information and your resources to help one another. Black women are more likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer, and have more aggressive forms of the disease than white women. Each of you have your own set of unique circumstances, but we are dealing with a disease that can be cured if monitored and treated properly. We need to give our breasts the attention they deserve. So, does anyone want to share? Anybody? Oh yeah, Denise. Well, I just had day 30 of my chemo, I'm almost done. I know, what a wonderful thing. And I feel good today. I'm strong. I know I can beat this thing. How wonderful for you, Denise, but some of us don't have enough time left to think about next year. Let me just remind you that we were just at Jasmine's funeral last weekend. I mean, she was just sitting here with us, now she's gone. I haven't forgotten about Jasmine. Yeah, well, some of us are barely hanging on to hope. But y'all wanna post your little pictures on social media of your bald heads and your smiles, like this isn't killing women. Women do that to encourage one another; to let each other know they can get through this. I'm angry. I'm hurt. And I hate... that this is happening to me. My cancer is terminal. I have kids for God's sake. What are they gonna do without me? Tell me that? Look, I know that you are so angry-- You're damn right I am. I wanna live! Oh, God, we all want that. I'm sorry, excuse me? What did you say? You wanna talk? Tell me your name. I'm Tasha Jackson and I was simply agreeing with the fact that we all want to live. Well, the great news is that I just found out that I'm pregnant with my first child. A baby that I have wanted and prayed for my entire life. A baby that, clinically speaking, I was never supposed to be able to conceive because I'm infertile. I was. On the flip side is the reason we are all here. I too have been diagnosed with breast cancer. My doctor has advised that I terminate my pregnancy in order to begin treatments immediately. But sacrificing my child's life in order to save mine is a decision that I simply cannot make. Adopt a baby. Terminate your pregnancy and save your life. Take it from someone who isn't gonna beat this thing. Charlene, please. Can you tell me, why is it so important that you would risk your own life for this baby? Do you have children? Yes, I have three. Would you risk your life in order to protect them? Would you die to save them? Of course I would. Even though my child is still inside of me, I feel that exact same way. Okay ladies, I'll see you next week. Uh, Tasha. This is Dr. Lopez's card. I know you think you're the only woman who has cancer while pregnant, but you're not. Go see him. I was told that you could help me Dr. Lopez. There has to be another option. Now, I have received all of your medical records that were transferred to my office, and I cannot say that terminating your pregnancy at this juncture was the wrong advice from your oncologist. In fact, it's normal practice to suggest termination in the first trimester when there's cancer present. You need treatment Mrs. Jackson, you need it now. You have an aggressive form of breast cancer. Hormones that your body's producing during your pregnancy will only cause the tumor to grow and possibly spread. You cannot afford to wait. What I can't afford is to abort my baby. Then I will do everything in my power to keep your baby safe while you receive treatment. You will? I will. But this will be a long hard road, nothing about this will be easy. What do we need to do? Well, the first step is a mastectomy of the left breast with a partial reconstruction, immediately. I understand your concerns. Surgery is always a risk, pregnant or not. And the closer the surgery is to the uterus, we run the risk of a spontaneous abortion. However, I feel certain that we can preform the surgery and keep the baby safe. So that's it? We do the surgery now, while I'm pregnant, and the chemo after? You will be receiving chemo during your pregnancy Mrs. Jackson. What? How on earth is that possible? Dr. Lopez, I saw first hand what that chemo did to my mother and it sucked the life out of her. How could I go through something like that while I'm pregnant? How could my baby survive that? While there are certain types of chemo that would harm the baby, there are other types that will be harmless, spread out over a period of every three weeks for six months, and I will connect with your obstetrician. We will monitor both you and the baby very closely. I'm sorry, but this is a lot to process. I must tell you that while I am certain that we can keep the baby safe, I cannot be certain of how the cancer will react. So what you're telling me is that I could go through all of this and still won't be cured? Yes. The reality is we can give you this treatment and it will not work. Even as doctors we cannot ignore the possibility that your husband would raise this child, your child, alone. The choice is yours, Mrs. Jackson. But I promise to be with you every step of the way. I see that you're married too. What would you tell your wife if she were the one that was sitting here? I'd tell her to keep that baby and to start her treatment now. This is the... This is the lobby. All right, this must be upstairs. Yeah. I hope they got the AC up there. I know, this heat is killing me. You ain't lying. And this is the extra for... I don't even know what this is for. We got room for the other one. Hey. I need to talk to you. Hey, Tony. Hey, Tasha. Bernie told me about the baby, congratulations. Thanks. What? You mind giving us a minute? I'll be inside. Good seeing you, Tasha. Bye. What do you gotta tell me that couldn't be-- couldn't be said on the phone Tasha? All right, first you need to get rid of your little attitude. I'm working babe, okay? What is it? I went to see a new oncologist this morning to get a second opinion. So, you went to the doctor without me? Yes. I mean, it's not like you were there for my sonogram appointment, so what's your point? Babe, you're really pushing it, all right? Just tell me what happened. He said that I can keep the baby and begin treatment for the cancer right now. That he could keep our baby safe. He said that? Yeah. But in addition to the chemo, I also have to have a surgery. What kind of surgery? A mastectomy. That I have to have my left breast removed immediately. But Bernie, the point is, we can keep our baby. Yeah, yeah. That's exactly what we're gonna do. Oh God, I was hoping you would say that. My big announcement is... my husband and I are having a baby. Now, because I will need plenty of rest, I am going on leave after today, and you all are getting a substitute teacher. I know, I will miss each and every one of you very, very much. Yes, Aubrey? But your tummy isn't big. That's because the baby is still growing. KJ. How did the baby get in your stomach? We all know the stork doesn't drop off the baby at the hospital. Mm-hmm. Okay, let's change the subject, shall we? If you all could open up your science readers to page 11, and not that kind of science. Okay mammals, that's what we're gonna talk about, mammals. Bernie honey, come on, come on and sit down. You gotta think positive. I'm sure Tasha and the baby are gonna get through the surgery just fine. And what if they don't? You know, cause if Tasha wakes up, and finds out anything happened to that baby. She'll never forgive herself, or me. None of this is your fault. It is my fault, Melvin. I should have done something else, I don't know. Mom and baby are fine. Mrs. Jackson did great. We were able to get her left breast and the tumor. Thank you, Doc. Thank you. Your welcome.

Me too, but she would be so proud of you. And so happy about that grandbaby. I know. Brenda, I know for the first two years I was very upset about you and Daddy. Oh, listen that's water under the bridge girl. I know that I was young, and I just didn't understand. But, I want you to know how beyond grateful I am that he has you. And even though he may be a little complicated at times... -...know how much he loves you. - Well, I can certainly say I love him. Now, let's get that dress on. We are going to shower you with gifts. Aw. That is so adorable. Look at these booty shorts. Baby booty-- Come on man. Look at this! The little-- Who did this one? Oh my God, that is so beautiful. Oh. Precious. Isn't that sweet, Carol?

Daddy gets every shot-- Oh, here we go again. Here we are again bro. Melvin. Here we go. Look. Today, I am 33 weeks pregnant, and we also had your baby shower. The biggest news, is that you are gonna be here in about, oh just a few short weeks. Oh honey, see the doctor's gonna perform what they call a C-section. And that means he's gonna cut you outta mommy's tummy. Now, I know that may sound gross and it may be too much information, but the point is that you are going to be here soon and safe. Keep on doing what you're doing girl, you are so strong. And promise me that you're always gonna be that way. Oof! My goodness, time for a potty break. Mommy can't keep going like this with a three pound Patricia on her bladder. All right. How do I get out of this chair? Okay, here goes. Oh my God. Bernie? I think my water just broke! The baby's here. She and Tasha are doing just fine. Congratulations, Daddy. Ah, thank you. Oh, my God. She's uh... She's a little small, but they say she's doing good. Amazing. - Yeah. - And how's my baby girl? She was a champ bro. Melvin, she was a champ. Oh, that's my baby. Thank God. Thank God. I cannot believe this. I'm a papa. Yes, you are. And uh... you're a proud grandpapa. Yeah, uh, okay. I guess I am. Congratulations. Baby, you did so good. Oh yes, we just saw the baby in NICU. Daddy, could you stop? I look a mess. What you talking about? You look great, I mean considering. Tasha's a mommy. You did it. I did, didn't I? Yes, you did, baby. She's healthy and wonderful. Yeah, she is. Knock knock. Oh, Dr. Lopez. Your OB called my office and let me know you delivered the baby last night and everything went well. Thank you. No thanks needed. I'm just glad she arrived safely. Yes. A little earlier than we would have liked. A little early. What about Tasha? Well, she has two more chemo sessions. And then we'll get the MRI, see if she's cleared. Could we not talk about that right now and focus on celebrating? Well, you do that and I will see you later. Everybody take care. Huh? - Thank you. - Thank you. Well, I don't know about ya'll, but I can't wait to get that baby home. Now listen, you don't have to worry about a thing. I'm gonna come over. I'm gonna sleep on the couch. I'm gonna fix the formula. I'm gonna change the diapers. I'm gonna get up in the middle of the night with the baby. I know Bernie don't know nothing about taking care of no baby. I was praying you would say that. I don't know what we would do without you, Brenda. I don't think Bernie knows how to change a diaper. I don't think so either. Look who's here. Oh, honey. I know, I know. Oh my God, would you look at that girl? Look at this big old baby. Oh. - Hey, little mama. - Oh. - Come here. - How precious is she? Come here, what you smiling at? - Hi. - Huh, what you smiling at? Come on. - I know, I know, I know. - It's okay. - Come to Mama. It's okay. Patricia, it's fine. It's all right, baby. Don't cry, honey. Here you go. It's okay. - Here you go. - There you go. That's what that girl wanted. Good job, Daddy. And Mommy can't wait to get up from here and take care of you herself. Mommy needs to give it some time. I know. All right, don't over do it. You just finished your last chemo session, and you need your energy to celebrate this little lady coming home. Hey, baby. Oh, wow. Honey, could you please take her? Hm? Take her I can't. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got you. I got you. When are, um, Daddy and Brenda supposed to get here? Um, they said they should be here within the hour. Okay. Did you make that last bottle before you left? I'm doing it right now. Baby, are you sure you got it? 'Cause I don't... Yeah, sure, yeah. You don't sound too convincing. I got it. Okay, okay, Mommy's coming. Mommy's coming, baby. Don't cry, honey. Okay. Just give Mommy some time, okay? Mommy time. Oh, Patricia don't cry, baby. Okay? Okay, I'm coming baby. I'm coming. Just give me some time, okay? Okay, I'm coming, baby. Okay, I'm coming. Here we go. I don't know if this is gonna be enough, but... Tasha! Between the chemo and the pregnancy, she's extremely anemic. She's losing blood flow to her brain and it's caused her to slip into a coma. Now, there are different medicines we are trying, but a blood transfusion may have to be performed. Without proper blood flow to her brain, her organs could shut down. And if that happens, there's not much that we can do. Mrs. Jackson needs to fight. Did you know you were named after your grandmama? That's right. I loved me some her. She was my bestest friend in the whole world. I had just moved to the neighborhood, and I didn't have one friend. For weeks I sat up on my porch and watched her playing jump rope across the street. Finally one day, she marched over to me and said, "What's wrong with you? Get off that porch right now and come and play with me." And from that day forward we were connected at the hip. Until the day she passed. I never heard that story about how you and Patricia met before. I didn't hear you come in. How's Tasha? Nothing's really changed. I mean, she had a... pregnancy, a mastectomy, chemo, delivered a baby safely, all for what? So she can get laid up in a hospital fighting for her life? Anemic? And we still don't know if the cancer's gone into remission yet. I know. It's so unfair. I wish I could go see her. You can. I can sit with the baby. No, she'd want me to stay here and take care of Patricia. I was thinking that uh... we should get married. I've been waiting a long time to hear those words, but... But what? You're scared right now, Melvin. You don't know what's gonna happen with Tasha, and you want me to stick around. That's not it. Yes, it is. I left once and you're thinking maybe I'll leave again. And you don't like to be alone. Don't tell me what I'm feeling and what I'm thinking. I asked you because I love you. And yes, I know what I said to you when I found out about Tasha was harsh, and I'm sorry for that. But I really do love you. And you've taken care of my family for me. You think I do all this for you? I take care of all of you because my best friend isn't here to take care of you herself. I'm taking care of the baby and trying to make sure Bernie has a hot meal when he gets home. I don't have time to think about marrying you right now. Tasha. Wake up. Patricia needs you, baby. I need you. I'm sorry. It'll be over... It'll be over soon. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Oh my God, I'm sorry. Oh my God. I know. I know, I'm sorry. Tasha. Tasha. Mama? I thought I taught you to fight? You did. Well, why aren't you fighting this, baby? Mama, I fought the good fight, but I can't. - I'm tired. - Oh, you fight anyway, honey. You ball your fist up and you swing at this thing with everything you got, honey. - But, I can't-- - No buts. Don't give up. You can't give up. - Mama. - You got it. Mama, wait. Mama, wait don't go. Mama. Mama, don't leave me again, please. Bernie, wake up. She's awake. Baby! I'm gonna go get a nurse. Okay. Hey, hey look at me, hey baby look, you have a tube in your throat. Somebody's coming to get it. Melvin went to go get someone, okay? Relax. They'll take it out, okay. ♪ Happy birthday, Mommy Happy birthday, Mommy ♪ ♪ Happy birthday dear Mommy ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ Go ahead. Make a wish. All my wishes have come true. Yes.
