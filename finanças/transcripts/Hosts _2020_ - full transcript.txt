Jacko! What is all this about? Don't even go there, mate. It's almost become like a tradition now. It's the old festive Christmas Eve hunt, isn't it? Well, yeah, you've certainly gone all out this year. You've even got the beard and everything! Oh, don't worry about that. That'll be gone by dinner time. - Why? - Cassie hates it. She's got a point, mate. Not you and all. I like it! I see you've had a bit of luck this year, though? These are beauties, mate. Look at them. I caught the little bastards right off-guard! You caught them off-guard? It's hard to imagine you catching anything off-guard! Don't worry, though. There'll be plenty for you and Lucy. 7:30 alright for the pair of you, still? Yeah, yeah, yeah, we'll be there. Means I can dump my share of Cassie's God-awful stuffing right on your plate. So what's in yours then, snoopy? - Now, this. - Yeah? This is a surprise. Fair enough. Well, I better get dinner plucked, stuffed - and ready for later. - Mm-hmm. - Catch you later. - See you later. Hey! Don't forget to leave plenty of room on your plate. Will do! Babes! The one and only. Oh, it's Christmas! Almost. I missed you. I missed you, too, you crazy Christmas puppy. Work sucked. I know. Yeah, and you? - Yeah! - Yeah? - Not sick of the little brats then yet? - Never! - I love the idea of seeing them grow into little people. - Aww. Even more so, over time I get to share my wisdom with them. You're adorable. But I give it to the end of January and you'll be back down the job center. So, why are you still wearing your hat? - Yeah, about that... - Yeah? Remember when you said ages ago that you wanted to see what I looked like - with blonde hair, hmm? - Yeah. And I said I wouldn't do it because it was stupid. Yeah. Well, I thought I'd surprise you for Christmas. But it's gone wrong! Alright, yeah yeah yeah, that's enough. - Laugh at Jack. - No, no, no, it's not, it's not that bad. - You can be... - Really? ...my little silver freak. We'll go with silver fox, hmm? My silver fox. You make me really happy. Ok. What are you after? Ooh... Presents! No, no, no! Right. Uh... How am I supposed to know which one mines is? Is, is, is, is? You haven't written any names on it, you donut. These are for the Hendersons. Oh, you little spoiled brat! You got the Hendersons presents? Yes, I got the Hendersons presents! Well, why wouldn't I? Because I got the Hendersons presents. What? Where? Out in the hallway in the bag that I asked you for last night when I said "Can I have a bag to put the presents in?" You never said who they were for. Well, it's not like I'm gonna get my old man a present, is it? "Bag in the hallway that you gave me last night." Show me then, big spender. Alright. Sit, puppy. Right, close your eyes. Really? Where's the romance gone, Lucy? Fair enough. Do I have to unwrap it with my eyes closed, too, yeah? - It's up to you. - Cool. Ok, ok. Ooh. Ooh. It's quite solid. Oh, a book maybe? - Ok. - Maybe. "To the best primary school teacher in the world. "You've come so far and I'm so proud "of everything you've achieved. "The kids are gonna love you. "Merry Christmas, all my love, Jack." That's you. You're amazing. I really wasn't expecting this. I mean it. I'm proud of you. I love you. I love you, too. Do we really have to go over? No, but Michael's always been so welcoming. It would be rude not to go, you know that. Well, seeing as we're doing this. Ooh. For you! Yeah, go on! Yeah! No note? Well, I didn't realize you were gonna do all this! I'm guessing you want me to wear this monstrosity tonight, yeah? Yes! Happy? What? Jack, there's something in the garden. What does it look like? Like two little torches. Just moving. Little torches? What, like borrower torches? No, Jack, I'm serious. Yeah, I know, but you're not making any sense. - Look, I saw these two little lights. - Whereabouts? The bottom. There. Like, bottom right. Bottom right? - Lucy. Bottom right? - Yeah. Like, just there, like two feet from the bottom. Like, the bottom right. - Right, well, I'm going outside. - No, no, no! Look, I'll be back in a minute, yeah? Be careful. There's nothing there, babe. The coast is clear. Luce? Lucy! Luce? Luce? Oh, my God, no! Lucy, calm down! Lucy! Lucy! Lucy, calm down! Lucy! Oh, babe! Lucy! Michael? Yes, love? Dinner's ready in half an hour. Ok, love. You alright? Yeah. Is she... Is she there? - What? - Your mum. Is she there? Yeah, why? You're a funny guy. What you reading anyway, Dad? Anything that makes me look busy. Got it down to a tee, I see? You'll learn from the best. Oh, yeah? Who's that, then? ...Seen as a disappointment. Traditional Christmas seems to be becoming a thing of the past, as more and more are abandoning outdated nativity scenes in favor of a more pagan-like celebration, commemorating the winter solstice. This is the time of year where the sun draws closest to us, - and many take this as an opportunity - Michael? to acknowledge the light... Well, go on then, old man! Eric, go and get your brother and sister, will you? So lazy! Concerns about the decreasing numbers - within the British population. - Love you, son. Love you, Dad! He encourages families to remember the core values of honesty and unity at this festive time. In other news, many fear that we are set for disaster if the fracking continues. Increased yet unconfirmed reports have been coming in this evening of what many are calling electrical anomalies, some even going as far as calling them "supernatural events." At this point we aren't exactly... Jesus! I know what you were doing, you fool. What's that supposed to mean? You're hiding away in here and you're not helping me in the kitchen. I'm sorry, Cass. I've just had a lot on my mind lately. I'm not sure I can do this. I don't think I can tell him. Look, Michael, we've talked about this. I've got nothing else to say on the matter. Now, will you please help me make dinner for your family? I'm sorry. Come on, then. Let's go. Get up, you big fat lump! - You come here, old man! - Oh, my sore knee. I know who needs one. - I'm gonna have one of your spuds. - Don't you dare! - I'm gonna have two of your spuds! - No, you don't! I'm gonna nick one of your spuds! It's your go. It's your go. - Lauren? - Just do it. But it's your go. Oh Ben, leave me alone for one minute, would you? Sorry. Hello? Hey, can you talk? Yeah. I miss you. I miss you, too. Sorry I couldn't come. That's ok. We've got Boxing Day. Yeah. How was dinner? Haven't had it yet. Oh, right. Listen. I'm really sorry I've been a bit over the top recently with everything. I just feel like time's running out. What I'm trying to say is that you make me happy. I see how close you and your family have gotten this year and I kinda just want that with you. Babe? Lauren, you there? You're so cute. I'm just confused about it all. I don't know if I even want this. I feel a bit suffocated with everything. Like what? I just like things the way they are. Don't you? Of course I do, but... You know what? I'm sorry. You're right. Look, you go and enjoy your evening. I'll say no more on this. The ball's in your court and we'll leave it at that. I can wait until you're ready. I ain't going anywhere, ok? Thank you. I'll see you tomorrow, ok? See you tomorrow. Bye. Bye. Confused about what, Lauren? Nothing. - It's your go. - Guys! You're such a moron. Come and play, Eric! Yeah, Eric, come and play. Nah, food's almost ready. Ok, moron. Oi you, come here! Did you build your swing? No. I got the rope over but the branch is too high. I need you to help me tie it. Eric, put him down. Maybe I'll help you with it tomorrow. Always a pleasure coming home for Christmas! Hey. How d'ya feel, Cassie? Yeah, fine. Great. Well, that's a meal and a movie next week then if I can get a sitter? Yeah, well, take me to the theatre - and I'm all yours! - Done. I'll see if I can call Nancy on Friday. When's dinner, Mum? Ben's starving! Put him down, love. Blame dad, he did that to me all the time. Difference is, you used to cry. Yeah, well, that's why we don't do it any more, right, Michael? I used to hold you up by your feet, actually. Hence the crying. I'm sitting next to mum! Go on, I'll deal with you later. Oh Michael, I forgot to do the onions. Not the onions! Oh, God, no! Chill out, enjoy your drink. Jesus! Right on time, come in! We're through here, Luce. How's it going? Oh, Lucy, how lovely to see you! How are you? How are you? I'm good. Yeah, I'm great, actually! Oh, Lucy, would you mind helping me with this? I completely forgot to put them in with the pheasants. You're gonna love this, mate. Hey? Now, what you're looking at is a broken-down old relic. But I look at this and I see my old dad. Well, that's all I've got left to remember him by. My inheritance. Do you know, every Friday I'd come home from school, and me and my dad would sit in front of this thing and we'd watch our favorite shows right up to the early hours. Loved spending time together, we did. Do you know I can't even remember what half the shows were about? It's just that we enjoyed each other's company. They're the times I remember the best. The old man lost most of his money when the coal mines closed. They had to sell everything to make ends meet, apart from this. I want to leave this to my boy. I ain't gonna be around forever, am I? I just hope that it means as much to him as it does to me. You're right. It's broken. But I'm gonna fix it. I want to fix it. There's no inheritance for us. We'll take what we can get. Oh, Jack. I'm so sorry. Ignore me, I'm not thinking straight. Hey. Lucy. Jack, I know you wanted to see this earlier. Now there's a toy with purpose. You like? She's a bloody beauty, isn't she, son? Excuse my language, Lucy. Do you know what? If those new safety windows don't keep intruders out, - this thing definitely will. - Michael? Oh. Food. Go on through, guys, the kids are in the living room. Are they ok? Yeah, I think so. It's just awkward, isn't it? I mean, Christmas should be spent with your family, shouldn't it? - Poor boy. - I know. I don't think I could have shaken it off if I'd have been in his shoes. Yeah. Let's just try to make them feel as welcome as possible. That's all we can do, isn't it? Of course. I give it five years. Dad's got a full head of hair. Almost. Lauren, don't scare him. Doesn't matter, it skips a gen. Look, you're receding already. Get off! Lauren! Anyway, I'm not scared, old man. - Lauren's wrong, though. - We'll see. Children. Will I go bald, Mum? Oh, kids, please! Lauren, how's Matt? Fine. What dad meant was, how are you doing as an intimate couple? None of your business, loner. Date nights, intimacy, pregnancy. Eric, shut up! Eric, don't pea on your sister! - My little baby girl? - Mum! - You're not actually pregnant, are you? - No! Could be. Eric, stop teasing your sister. So why didn't he want to come tonight? Why would he? He proposed, Mum! Did he really? - No? - Such a dick. Right. I'm fine. Matt's fine. We're not pregnant, nor are we engaged. Aw, disappointing. Says the single, friendless, twenty-nine year old mong. - Love you. - Yuck. My kids! Dad, I'm sorry but he's with his parents tonight. Well, that's a shame. Dad loves his guests. The more the merrier. But you two are happy, yes, love? Yeah. Yeah. And if you must know we have been talking about the idea of marriage. - Oh, Lauren! - No, no, no, Mum. No, stop! Stop it! Another excuse to use the shotgun. - Oh, Michael Henderson! - Merry Christmas, sis. A bit harsh, Dad! Alright, we're only playing. Yeah, but why is it always at my expense? I'm sorry. In all seriousness, Lauren, no, we're thrilled for you. We really are. We're so proud, and I want you to know that we love Matt. We do. We wanted both of you to know that. Yeah, we love Matt. We've just talked about the idea of it. We're not there yet, ok? You take as long as you need, love, alright? We just want our little girl to be happy. She's so happy. No, I'm with your mum on this one. As long as you're happy. Thanks, Dad. And if the time comes, you know we're right behind you. You'll have our backing, financially, as well. Ok, thank you both. But can we stop talking about my private life, please? Aw. Sorry. Lucy, how's the food? So, can I have your attention for a moment, please? I've got an announcement to make. You have? Can you even still have babies? Babies on the mind? I assure you, it all still works down there. Dad, that's gross. Divorce? I'll divorce you in a minute, you little smart-ass. Just pipe down, alright, guys? Stop! Oh, you're disgusting. Sorry, Mum. Go on. So you all know that it's been seven months since I was diagnosed with a very low chance of survival. Mum? Honey, can't we talk about this tomorrow? Please. We haven't been together in so long and I need to get this off my chest. So, the doctors, God bless them, they did say right at the beginning that the success rates for chemo were very low. They offered me so much support, and they were very thorough with the information they gave me. The options I had, and my life expectancy with or without the chemo. It's no surprise that I chose the chemo because they told me I'd last about eight weeks without it, - and it's been... - Seven months. You look amazing, Mum. Let your mother speak, son. Eric, it's ok. So, chemo is rarely the answer. It just prolongs life, and sometimes that's not necessarily the right answer. It just puts the disease on hold. I love you all more than anything in this world. So, you think the doctors were good? Well, that's nothing compared to the unconditional love that you've all given me. The painful sleepless nights, Michael. The daily phone calls. The lovely visits and so much more. I love you all to the moon and back. So, last month I decided that it would be smart to write a will, and I did. But then a couple of days ago the doctors advised me that it was now pointless. Honey, come on, what kind of doctor would tell you that? Who was he? They all sat me down and they said that their decision was unanimous. Why? Because I'm officially in remission. What? Mum? Serious? Serious! It's gone? Well, I mean, there's a slim chance of it coming back, of course, but in all practical senses, yes! Mum, that's amazing. - I love you, Mum. - I love you. You alright, Dad? Of course I am, you daft sod. Why didn't you tell us when you found out? Because she wanted to torture you, crybaby. - You're horrible. - You deserved that one. What's remission? Hey, it means that your mother's not ill anymore. - You happy, bro? - Yes! Perfect timing, Cass. I thought it would be a good Christmas present. Dad, shall we go back to talking about Lauren's love life again? - You dare. - I love you all. Alright, hold on a minute. Pipe down, you lot, just for a moment. I think this calls for a toast. - Go on, Dad. - Hear, hear! To the most beautiful, amazing, incredible wife. And mum. Yep, and to the most incredible mum to our beautiful children. I give you Cassie Henderson! To Mum! Oh, my God, Lucy! Stop it! Stop it! No! Sit down! Very well. Eat. We're all just products of our own environments. Betrayals, neglect. The things we've done, the things done to us. The burden of our elders' insecurities forcefully dressing us in life long misery jackets, paying the price for other people's mistakes. But when you think about it, Lauren, you are merely just a sponge soaking up all the self centered action of those who supposedly love you so selflessly. Don't you want to be set free? Move! I don't care what you do to me, but please just leave my kids alone. Come clean, Michael. Get some rest. Dad! Lucy, stop! Don't hurt him! Nobody's getting hurt, hmm? It's getting late. People are tired. I'm tired. Let's all just calm down, shall we? There's no need to get worked up over nothing. What? What? Please stop this. I'll do anything. Just let us go, I'm begging you. We never done anything to you. Lucy, please, no! Please! No! Why'd you do that to my mum?! She was already dead. Lie down. Oh, please, God. Please. Please, Jack. Years ago, a father and his family lived happily in a big, bright house, and one day the father decided to invite some guests inside. The guests willingly obliged. The father took them under his wing, but this was short lived, though. Little did the guests know that eventually the father would deem them unwanted, and so when the time came, the father took for himself what was rightfully theirs, and unfairly banished them, leaving them to rot. So the guests waited and waited and waited and waited, until one night they found their way back into the garden. But they had disguised themselves. Do you see? Do you see?! The father, not knowing he had been tricked, welcomed them back into his home, right under his pretentious little nose. Do you know how this story ends, Ben? They destroy everything he loves. Who are you? Demons come as angels of light. Don't do that. - Come on. - Hello? Matt. I need you to get help and come here. There's people in the house. Lauren, you're scaring me. My parents' friends came over for dinner tonight. Yeah? We were having dinner and... they killed mum. What? They killed her. She murdered her right in front of us. Lauren, what the hell is this? You're not making any sense. They didn't stop hitting. She had a hammer and she just kept thumping mum's head... Lauren? ...until there was nothing left. My mum is dead. Lauren, who did this? My mum is dead. Lauren! The neighbors. The neighbors? What neighbors? Jack and Lucy. Jack and Lucy? Why? I don't know. Mum never did anything wrong. Why would they do this? Lauren, just get out of the house. I can't. Babe, whereabouts are you right now? In my room, on my bed. Just get out now. I can't. What do you mean you can't? Just run! They're still in the house, they've got Ben. Babe, call the police. I can't. They've got Ben now, I need to go get him. No. You, you need to call the police. I need to go and get Ben. Lauren, don't make a sound. Just hide. Stay as quiet as possible. Matt, I need you to come in here and help me. No, no, no, no. Listen to me, you need to stay still. Everything's gonna be fine. Just stay quiet. We've been watching you for a long time. Matt? But I think you should go to sleep now... Lauren. Lauren. Eric? Lauren. Eric? Oh shit... Well, well, well. When I'm finished here, you're going to have to make a choice, Lauren. They say that when you die, the ones that are affected are the ones that you leave behind. So it all boils down to whether you want to put him out of his misery. He won't know any better. Or don't. Save yourself the lifelong guilt. But one thing I will say, if you don't, the consequences for him will be far more severe. But why? I just want to get to know you. I just want to get to know you. You've so graciously invited us over and you've been such wonderful hosts. I think we're all set. Please. Please. Please, I'm sorry. Eric. Eric! He's waking up. Lucy, please. Please. He's my brother. You'd better do it quickly. Please. Please, Lucy. Do it. Lauren? What are you doing? I'm so sorry. Lauren, no. They're gonna kill us. You're my sister. If I don't do this, we'll both regret it. They're gonna do worse things to you, and once they're done, they'll do the same to me. I don't care. Please don't do this. I can't have my sister kill me. I won't have my sister kill me. You will. You will care. Just put it down. I can't. Look what they did to mum. I can't watch them do something worse to you. Mum's dead. I'm not. I'm sorry. They won't let me go, they won't let us go! It's just you and me. There's nobody here. You've got a choice. You don't understand. They're watching us. They've been watching us this whole time. If I don't do this, God knows what they're gonna do next. They've gotten into your head. Please don't do this. I always looked up to you when we were kids. - Don't. - I still do. You have a funny way of showing it. Listen, you need help. Please put down the gun, Lauren. I'd always run into your room when mum and dad used to fight, and every time, you'd cheer me up. Stop. You still cheer me up. I love you. Do you? You're about to kill me. You don't understand. No, you don't understand what I'm trying to say. Please don't kill me. I have no choice. We always have a choice. This is for the best. No, no. Lauren please, no. Lauren. - I'm sorry. - Lauren! They gave me no choice. You had a choice. I'm so sorry. Fuck you! I've been there for you your entire life! You and Ben. For all your self-indulgent bullshit, even when you were wrong, I was always there! I'm so sorry. I can't. I'll never forgive you. I had no choice. I had no choice. I forgive you. Stop! What have I done? I didn't do anything! Leave him alone! I'm so sorry, Eric. I'm so sorry, Eric. I'm so sorry. I'm so... Leave my kids alone, you fucking animals! Leave them alone! Please! Dad! Open this door. Open this fucking door! Please, please, open this. Dad. Dad. This is all my fault, son. Jack is my son, and I never told him, and I bought this on all of us. What do you mean, he's your son? It was a long time ago, before I met your mother. I was a coward. I panicked and I left them. I left them. And then I met your mother. She made me a stronger man. And I tried to go back, I tried to fix it. But I didn't know how to tell him or you and I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Lauren! Eric! Lauren! Eric! Eric! No! No! No! - Lauren! - No! Open this door! Open this fucking door! Open this door! Leave him alone! Eric, I'm so sorry. Eric? Lauren? Son? What did they do to you? They took my eyes. They what? Jesus Christ! We've got to get out of here! We've got to get out! Where's your brother? Where's your sister? The garage. Ok. Come on. Be quiet. I've got to get you to a hospital. I'm not gonna let anything else happen to you. No, you won't. Are you alright? Yes, Michael. We're exactly where we need to be. Dad? You're not my son. You're not my... You're not my son. Get off! You're not my son. You're not my son. Dad. Dad. Dad, don't! Dad! You're not my son! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Stop! No, Lauren! Lauren! No, no. Lauren, no! Ben? Ben? Ben? Ben? Ben! Go to Hell! I'm sorry, son. I'm sorry. Lauren! Ben? I'm going to take care of you from now on. I promise...
