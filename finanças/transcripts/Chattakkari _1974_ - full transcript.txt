'CHATTAKKARI' Dad.. Yes, I'm coming. - Dad. My sweet girl, I'm coming. That's pork! Very good. Yes, Dad. What's your mom doing? - She's in the kitchen cooking for the party. I completely forgot that Pillai is coming home tonight. By the way, what are Ilin and Johny doing? - They're playing. Didn't Ilin's boy friend turn up today? No. It's time to leave. Bye.. - Bye. - What is it? Dad, don't drink too much at night. No, I won't. I promise you, my young girl. Bye, Dad. - Bye.. I want a tin of cheese. - Hey, Mohammad Ali you better not give her just anything. I'll give her what she wants. You go and get one strong tea. Come, ma'am. I'll give you what you want. Come on. Small one or a big one? - Small one. It isn't too small. That small tin will do. - Okay, you may take it. All these are cheese. Take whichever tin you want. Don't touch me. Don't be so arrogant, ma'am. Mom will pay you later. I didn't ask you for money. You may pay me, whenever you want. But do pay me, some day. You bloody scoundrel! I understood what you just said. You're worried someone will see. No one will see us here. Don't talk rubbish. Are you really serious? Okay, then you may go. You just come to buy things for free. You already owe me around Rs. 500. Julie.. Ms. Julie! Ms. Julie.. Here. Do you want anything more? I'll write it in your account. Do you want something else? - No. Here's your tea. - You can drink it yourself! Hi, Julie. Why do you look disturbed? Nothing. Come on, Julie. Come on. Stop it, Richard. - You look very serious today. Thank you, Richard. - Good night, Julie. Good night. It's imported. Only the water is Indian. Foreign whisky with Indian water. My dad is not particular about having mineral water. What to do? Poor Indians! I'm sorry. - Never mind. - Excuse me. Julie, did you get it? - Yes, I did. - Thanks. You get ready and come out. What for? - Don't you have manners? Come on, be quick. Excuse me. My son sent this from Delhi. He is working with a company in Delhi. We call him Jimmy at home but his actual name is Mac Wilson. That's my dad's name. My Dad was a pure Portuguese. - What about your mom? We don't care about our mothers. Mr. Pillai, my dad was a British. Royal Army captain. He died in the war-front. Anglo Indians have no respect in your country, anymore. This country also belongs to you. No.. If I get a chance I will definitely go back to England with my family. My Dad's brothers are all there. After the British left India, no one respects us here. We easily got a job in earlier times. But no one considers us these days. Julie! Put some lipstick, Julie. - No. A little, please. No, dear. I will definitely go to the UK. Hello. Good evening, my child. She is my daughter. Julie. Hello. - He is Mr. Pillai. Managing director of a big company. Are you studying, Julie? - Yes, I am. Meet me once you pass out. I'll hire you in my company. Thank you. Oh! That's the Fast Passenger. I didn't realize how time passed. - Julie, please arrange the dinner. Okay, Mom. - Please. - Excuse me. Let's finish the drink. - Sure. - Cheers. Hey, Ilin. Ilin. Get up, girl. Ilin! Lazy girl. Get up, it's 6 a.m. No excuses, come on, get up. Come on. I'm sleepy. 'Smoking is injurious to health.' Darling.. Dad! Dad! Good morning. - What's this, Dad? You're drunk in the morning itself. I drank as I was tired after duty. You also drink while going on duty. That is to get some energy to go to work. - I see. Where's Mom? - She is in the washroom. Okay. - Dad! - Come on, Ilin! Come on.. Come on.. - Good morning, Dad. - Come on. Come on. Come out. - Good morning, dear. Oh, my God. You started drinking, early morning. If you drink so much, we will soon be paupers. You will go and ram your train into something. Better be careful. To avoid such accidents the person giving signal should avoid drinking. Come on, darling.. I will tell you a story. Come on.. Julie, when I was walking through the railway yard yesterday I saw an ugly and pathetic beggar. Then I offered him a 'Charminar' cigarette. He told me he never smoked. Then I offered to take him for a couple of pegs of whisky. He told me he never drank. I told him, why not play a game of cards so he could earn some money. He told me he never played cards. He had no bad habits at all. I've invited him home. He doesn't smoke, doesn't drink alcohol isn't mad about girls and doesn't play cards. I want you to see how a man with no bad habits looks like. Dad! Julie. - Yes, Dad? - Won't you go to college today? Yes, I will. - What? - I am going. If you pass with a first class this year I will give you a beautiful wrist watch. Really, Dad? - Really. Oh, Dad! "Praise Lord Narayana.." "Praise Lord Narayana.." "Praise Lord Narayana.." "Praise Lord Narayana.." "Praise Lord Narayana.." "Praise Lord Narayana.." "Your lotus like feet touches the waves of the ocean." "Bless me so I could get a glimpse of you sitting on the throne." "Praise Lord Narayana.." "Praise Lord Narayana.." "You're the husband of Goddess Lakshmi, you bless us with wealth." "Bless me with a flower from your feet to adorn my hair with it." "You're the husband of Goddess Lakshmi, you bless us with wealth." "Bless me with a flower from your feet to adorn my hair with it." "Praise Lord Narayana.." "Praise Lord Narayana.." "You come down on Earth taking different reincarnations." "Bless me with a boon of touching your feet and sing your hymns." "You come down on Earth taking different reincarnations." "Bless me with a boon of touching your feet and sing your hymns." "Praise Lord Narayana.." "Praise Lord Narayana.." Julie. Good morning, Mr. Warrier. - Good morning. Is Morris on duty, today? - No, he has taken an off. Is it an official leave or a casual one? It's an off, in both ways. Please advise him. Okay, I'll come to your home one day and advice Morris. - Thank you, Mr. Warrier. Wait.. Come here. Give the offering of God to her. God is one for all. Come on, give it to her. Stretch your right hand. - Oh! I'm sorry. It's very nice, Mr. Warrier. If you come every morning, you will get this. - Okay. Take a seat. Usha will be here. Let me get ready for work. Your Anglo Indian friend is waiting outside. They are very untidy. She entered our house putting on her slippers. Everyone has their own practices. One should maintain cleanliness. Don't you walk bare foot outside the house? And then you enter our house barefoot. It's not the same. She is wearing a leather slipper. Shucks! They fry and eat beef. How will they be clean? Didn't you find a Hindu girl to befriend? Dirty people are found in every religion, Hindu or a Christian. Julie isn't a dirty girl. Why did you wash your hand after having the offering? She wiped off her hand with a kerchief used to clean one's nose. They don't abstain from the kitchen during menstruation. Hi! Sasi. Sasi, when did you come? I came.. - It's been a few days. He has grown like an electric post. Julie is a grown up girl too. Shall we go? - Bye. - Bye. I failed to recognize Sasi. He has completely changed, hasn't he? - Yes. Usha. - Yes. I consider your brother as a hermit. You will find cats in the disguise of lions, at times. What do you mean? I mean, he will pretend to be like a saintly man and when he sees his prey, he'll pounce on it. It's very dangerous. Ma'am! - What? Please come here. Don't ignore me. Step in, before you go. I have got a stock of very nice pens. Buy one for you. I don't want it. I have no money. Take a look at it, first. Come, let me show it to you. Come on.. Come here. Look. It's such a nice pen. And here is its ink. - I don't need it. It's a present from me. - Oh, God! Rascal! Julie, come here. Yes, Mom? You fool! Rahim gave us things on credit in emergencies. You've put an end to that! Mom, should I compromise on my self-respect? You're right, my child. If someone misbehaves with you, you should slap him on his face. If not him, his father will help us. Moreover, I have brought the money we owe to Rahim. You can go. Dolly. I'm going to give you a surprise. Who is leading, Ilin? - Joji. - That's good. Let's buy a car. It will cost only Rs. 1,250. Within six months, we'll have to pay Rs. 500. What? - We have to pay Rs. 500 only. When I get my salary next month, we'll have to pay Rs. 250. And now, we have to pay Rs. 500. - What? Rs. 500? - Yes. Where will we get it from? I took the money Jimmy sent, from the wardrobe. It's in my pocket. - No! My son works hard to send us money. Give me the money. - No. I don't need a car or gold. I want the money back. - No, please. Please.. No. You will spend the money. I won't give it back. You bloody fool! - You! I told you I want to buy a car. Don't mess with me. I will kill you. Well done! You please carry on. I'll just come. Johny, I'm going. I'm also going. Ilin, are you coming? Julie, shall I go? Go. - Bye. Bye. Johny.. Look! Why are you crying? Silly boy. Julie! Yes, Mom. Johny. It's okay. Where is Ilin? She went out with her boyfriend. Why don't you go out? Why do you always sit inside the house? Richard has been waiting for you since so long. Why don't you go out with him? Come on, you go. I'll do that. Give it to me. Julie, be careful. Boys have no control. Be careful. Okay, Mom. Hi. - Hi, Julie. Am I late? - No, it's okay. If I work as an apprentice in a loco-shed for six months Your dad told me that I might be appointed as a fireman. I don't like that job. If I work as a fireman for two years I can become an Engine driver. Only then will I marry you, Julie. Julie, I love you. Be careful, Richard. Who is it? Car! Ilin! Johny! Come soon. Mom! Dad! - Dad! Yes, Son. Is this our car? - Yes, my girl. Really? - Yes, my girls. You're great, Dad. You're really great. I'll teach you. - I want to learn driving too. I will teach all of you to drive. Where's your mom? Darling! - Dad, I think mom is very angry. I'll make her alright. I have got something with me. No, Julie.. You go.. Don't be silly, my darling. Dad. Is that a nice car? Yes, it's a beautiful car in good condition. Margarette, please understand we're the only Anglo Indian family who owns a car now. Among Engine drivers only Morris has a car. Be happy. It's a foreign car. What? Is it a foreign car? - Yes, it's an imported, Aston car. I see. Then it is good. Definitely. This calls for a celebration. Come on, Julie. Come on, Margarette. Come on. Thank you. I won't have it. This girl has no manners. She behaves like an Indian. Have a little, for your mom's sake. Okay. I will write to Jimmy tomorrow to inform him that we bought a car. When he comes home for Christmas let him roam around in our car. Let him enjoy. Let everyone else see how Morris and family enjoy their life. Hey! Don't spoil it. Dad, please. Add a little water to your drink. That's called adulteration. If I do so the government will sentence me to six months imprisonment. So, you can add water to your drink. I will drink it raw. Okay? Cheers. - Cheers. Johny, you go and bring the guitar. Julie, you sing a song. No. - Julie, please. - Come on.. "Love was just around the corner." "I knew that I was just a corner." "He said to wait till he was 20." "His heart was young and though, so empty." "I didn't even know" "that I loved him so" "till he went away." "He didn't realise" "when I looked in his eyes" "just smiled.." "I smiled" "with tears in disguise." "Now I'll never let him wander." "His heart is mine, there is no wonder." "He was meant for me." "I didn't even know" "that I loved him so," "till he went away." "He didn't realise" "when I looked in his eyes" "just smiled.. I smiled" "with tears in disguise." "Now I'll never let him wander." "His heart is mine, there is no wonder." "He was meant for me." "Love was just around the corner." "I knew that I was just a corner." Julie, shall we go for a movie? That's a good idea. - Dad, shall we go for a movie today? - What? A movie? - Tomorrow. Let's go tomorrow. - Okay. - Promise us, Dad. Promise? - Promise. Thank you, Dad. - Thank you. Come on, darling. Mom, come soon. The movie will start. Wait, I'm coming. There's enough time, we'll reach pretty fast. Wait, I'm coming too. - Julie, get in. Julie, get in. I lost my cigarette. Where is it? It is here. Come on. - No, not there. Come to this side. I'm sorry. - Don't be sorry, be jolly. Get in.. Get in, now. - Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. - Beautiful, Mom. No. Please move to a side. Let me find a way. Smoke! Smoke.. It's not from my cigarette. It is from the car. Come on. Hello.. Bye. - Bye. Dad, Usha and her father. Usha. - Bye, Usha. Bye. - Bye. Usha, bye. - I have no permission to speed up. Bye. Dad, is the car to be repaired? It's a minor repair. Nothing serious. Let me see. Johny, get water! Fire! Impossible! - What happened, Dad? There's nothing to worry. The water is boiling. Johny, get cold water quickly. Does this car run on steam? No, Ilin. Dad must've left the engine open mistaking it for a train. Julie, this is not the time to joke. It's a very minor repair. Then, my car will be in tip-top condition. Oh! My hand! - Mom! - Pull out. How nice it is. What happened, Dad? - What happened? Just a small starting trouble. Let me check. - Oh, no! What is this? What is the trouble? - No. Let me try.. What is it, Dad? The movie must have begun. We're still here. It's a minor defect. I'll repair it right away. Let's go walking, Dad. Come on. It's a minor repair. I'll get it all right. Darling. - Yes, darling. It's a bore car. No, it is a foreign car. Who said it is boring? Keep it. - Ilin. Take out your hat. Mom. Mom. - Yes, my dear girl. People must've left after the second show. Let us push the car back home. That's a better idea. Margarette, don't push the car. I'm here. Don't push. You gave away all the money to buy this, and now we have to push it. Margarette, don't be silly. This is a foreign, imported, Aston car. - Nonsense! We'll do one thing. We'll push the car. Okay, we'll push. Let Mom hold the steering. Let Mom drive. Come on. - Dad, I'm here. Come on. You're here. Come down, slowly. Come down. - Don't shout. Come down slowly. Slowly, come down. - You come from that side. Now, push the car. - Yes, Mom. Dad! - Dad! Mom! - Mom. Julie. - Julie. Johny. - Johny. Ilin. Ilin. She was all right. I don't know why she has given trouble. I will make her all right. Mom, we're hungry. Get lost! Come here! Don't ask me to get out. Listen, for the past two hours I was under the car. Don't get upset and walk away. - Leave me. I will take two days off from work and stay at home to get the car repaired. Next Christmas, we'll be going to the Church in our car. Promise. - Promise? - Promise. Ilin, driving is very easy. Dad has said that he'll teach me. I'll learn driving, first. Nothing doing. Dad will teach me, first. What is all this? - It's incense sticks. I borrowed it from Usha. You learn such dirty things from your Indian friend. Don't you? Light two candles. What's the matter? Get aside. Oh, my dear! You started drinking right in the morning, didn't you? Our friends will be coming over, today. I'm not happy on this Christmas day. What you said is not true, Father. That's not the right way. Why not? Your argument is baseless. Good morning, Mr. Warrier. Good morning. Merry Christmas to you, Julie. Thank you. - Good morning, Sasi. - Good morning and merry Christmas. Thank you. - Usha! Yes, Father? - Look, what all she has got for us. - Julie! Merry Christmas to you. - Thank you. - Come in. Julie, come here. Please sit down. We were having an argument. You be the mediator. - Oh! Please. After living in Kolkata for a few days he has become an atheist. My motive is to defeat him. Father, please come here. I'll be right back. Don't go away. When are you going back? If you want, I can go any day. Don't go for me. Should I stay back for you, Julie? Won't you go to the institute on this Christmas night? - I'll go. I'll be coming with Usha. Don't be so narrow-minded, Revathy. I'm not narrow-minded. Christians add eggs and pork fat to the snacks they prepare at home. I cannot allow you to bring those snacks to my kitchen. Is your kitchen a temple? - Yes, it is. I maintain my kitchen prim and proper. Please don't talk bad about the sweets she brought for us. I cannot allow mutton or fish in my house. You need not allow. Give it here. And keep it in your room. - Yuck! The snack is very tasty. If you want, you may have it too. You may eat it but don't enter the spiritual room without taking a bath. Here's what Julie brought us for Christmas. - Okay. I prepared it without eggs so that I could get it for you. - I see. It would've tasted better with eggs. But Usha and her mom are vegetarians. Sasi eats non-vegetarian food. - Really? On some rare occasions I eat mutton. There's a Chinese restaurant in Kolkata. I've had snake's meat, there. Oh, God! - Dirty. If your mom hears this, she will go crazy. She worships the Serpent. Okay, Mr. Warrier. I'll take your leave. Julie, today is Christmas. I think your dad will be in full form today. How many pegs down is he? He started drinking in the morning. Mr. Warrier, you had told me that you'd advise him. Okay, I will come someday. Bye, Sasi. - Bye. Your father is really great, Usha. What about my brother? Come on, Annie. Hi, Joji. - Hello. How are you? - Fine. Richard. Are you not ready, Julie? Hurry up. You carry on, Richard. - Julie. I'll take some time. Are you not coming with me? I'm sorry, Richard. I'll be coming with dad. You please carry on. How are you? It's been a long time. - Hello, good evening. Hello, Mr. Thankachan. How are you? Come on. Hello. - Hello. Come on. Hello, Ms. Pillai. Good evening. Come on, in. Please, Dad.. - Mr. Morris! Mr. Morris. Oh! How are you all? Come on, please.. - Dad.. Come. Hi, Julie. What are you doing here? Nothing. - Then, come on. I.. - What happened? Let me go, Richard. People are watching. Answer me. - I have nothing to say. Then why are you so? Didn't you hear me? - Richard, don't irritate me. All right. Oh! Hello, Usha. - Hi, Julie. Hello, Julie. Good evening. - Good evening. It's time for the programme. Let's go. Hello. How are you, dear? I'm very glad. He is Mr. Pillai. Managing director of a valve making company. Glad to meet you. He is Mr. Sasi. Do you know my boss Mr. Warrier? He is my boss's son. And so, he is my boss. - Come, dear. Come on.. Come. - Come. Morris. - Sorry. Sit there. Ladies and Gentlemen let us start the lunch and dance. Tonight, we have a special guest, Ms. Usha Warrier. I believe, she will sing a song for us. No. - Please, go. Please, go. - No, Julie. Come on. - I can't do this, Julie. Come. "Young men." "Young ladies." "We're the heart throbs of tomorrow." "We're the dreams that have no destination."

What? - I meant, I lost my matches. Come on, show your face. I'm in a hurry. Kiss.. Darling. What's this, Dad? Your mother did this mischief. Sweet dad, isn't he? - Yes, Julie. Julie, why didn't you dance with Richard, yesterday? They fought with each other, Mom. Who told you so? - I'm saying it. You ignored him completely. You're after that bloody Indian boy. Mom.. - Shut up! You always tell us about manners. How could I've turned him down when he called? Richard belongs to our community. Why did you dance with the Indian boy neglecting Richard? Be careful. Julie, I saw you getting intimate with him. Shut up! Sir! Sir.. What do you want? Sir, I came specially to see you. For what? - People are spreading rumours. I did not touch her deliberately. My hand happened to touch her. You fool! No, sir. That's not true. By mistake, I touched Ms. Julie's skirt. That's it. Why did you call me? Why did you stop buying things from my shop on credit? It would be of great help if you could clear my dues. I will clear your dues as soon as I get money. And I don't want credit from you anymore. Understand? - Sir, but.. Sir! God! Save me. You're a baby elephant! Sasi! "You're a boon that the cupid blessed me with." "You're a boon to me."

When will you return? - In May. Julie, I'll see you again in May. Which train are you boarding? The express. Sasi. - Darling. I'll miss you so much. - Sasi.. Julie. Julie. - Hey! What happened to you? Julie, where were you? Why? I went to meet a friend. I know your friend. - Who? Your new friend. - Shut up. Your friend's dad is here. - Who is here? Mr. Warrier. Oh! Mr. Warrier! Is he here? Ilin, I had invited him home. - I see. I'd told him to advise dad not to drink. He is advising so well. He is advising really well. You're really mischievous. Julie, he has been enquiring about you since the time he came in. Good evening, Julie. - Good evening, Mr. Warrier. I came here to advise your dad and look what I'm doing. Sir, death awaits an engine driver on duty every day. A pilot who flies a plane and a car driver have a good control over the vehicle they're driving. But we believe in the green signal that we get and keep driving, without being able to see in the front. This is not an excuse to drink so excessively, Mr. Morris. You must take care of your health. Let me take your leave. Sir, being my boss you came to my house and accepted my hospitality. I'll be grateful to you all my life. - It's all right. No.. - Thank you very much, sir. - Excuse me. I'm your boss and you're my junior while we're at our work place. Here, I've come to your place as a good friend. Excuse me, sir.. See you, then. Bye, Julie. Julie. Don't worry, no one can help him quit drinking. But be careful. His health is very bad. We're so helpless, Mr. Warrier. Give him healthy food to eat. Tell mom to take care. - Sure, I will. I'll take your leave. Good night. - Good night. 'The train leaving from Shoranur to Indore' 'is arriving on platform number one in a short while.' Okay, see you. Julie! Hi, Usha. Hello. Good afternoon, Mr. Warrier. - Good afternoon. How are you? I'm fine. Hello, Sasi. - Hello. - He is leaving. Oh, I see. What brought you here? Is your dad in this train? - No. Mom sent me to see someone. I see. See you, Mr. Warrier. - Bye. Usha, bye. The train has arrived. Hi. - Hi. Julie. What harm did I do to you? - What? I love you. I love you too. Oh, my dear.. - No. It's not the love you expect from me, Richard. - Julie! That's my name. Richard, I don't love you. I know you don't love me. You're after the bloody Indian boy. Richard! - I know. He will throw you out of his life, like a dead rat. That rascal.. - Shut up, Richard! Mind your words. All right. Hi, Jimmy! - Ilin! Julie! Jimmy, what about your job? - I got it! Mom, come out. Jimmy is back! My dear son! - Mom! My son, you have lost so much weight. Why didn't you send us a telegram? I had to leave in a hurry. Where's dad? - He'll come in the mail. I came by the same train. I never expected that dad would be on duty on that train. Dad will come in a while. We all waited for you during Christmas. Really? - Jimmy. What present did you get for me? What have you brought for me? I have got presents for all of you. He'll give it, have patience. - Jimmy. We purchased a car. A car? - Yes! We can only say that we own a car it doesn't move. Is it in such a good condition? Dad is here. My son! Dad! You have forgotten your father, my son. You have forgotten your father, my son. You have forgotten your father. - No. No, you have forgotten me. - Not at all. You are sloshed today. I will drink. My son is back home. You cannot stop me. - Please, Dad. I will drink. My son has come. None of you will stop me, today. Jimmy, what's the reason for your sudden visit? I'm going to the UK. - Really? My passport and ticket are ready. - My God! I have to join as soon as I reach. Once I settle down there I will take you all to England. Oh! You go, my son. You go soon. My dad's relatives are all in the UK. Let us not rot here. Let's go back to our country. You all go! I'm not coming. You all go! I'm not coming.. I will definitely go. All my uncles are there. We have no value here after the British left. People in our community easily got a job in those times. But now.. Anyway, I will go. This is the land where we were born and brought up, Mom. You shut up! I have worked here for so many years. I can't let go of the insurance and gratuity I will get. You can think of it once I go there and settle. If you go away, I won't be able to even see you, Son. Where I'll meet him? - Dad, please control. Dad, please don't cry. - No.. No.. I want to drink. I am very sad. I want to drink. I want to forget everything. I have got an imported whisky for you, Dad. My son! My son, you are great. You're great. - Dad. You're great. Usha. Good morning, Mr. Warrier. - Oh! Good morning, Julie. I'm in charge of the kitchen today. I'm a very good cook. - Really? Don't say this to anyone. If people learn that a senior most railway officer cooks in his house they will laugh at me. Usha, you may go if you're getting late. I'll take care of the rest. Where's Usha's mother? - My wife won't enter the kitchen for the next four days. That's sad. Jimmy has gone. Where? - To England. We are all going to settle there. - Even you, Julie? If everyone else goes, what can I do? Once he passes this exam Sasi will also be going to England for further studies. Did he write to you? Why do you want to know? I just asked casually. - Look at me. Naughty girl! The other day, in the institute.. - What? I saw everything. I also understood you came to the railway station to see off my brother. We're getting late. Let's go. - We aren't late. Stop there. Don't run. Brother wrote to me. After some years, we'll permanently shift to England. He has asked me to convey his special regards to Julie. - Hey Jimmy got a job so soon, isn't it? Sasi had written to me that I should convey his regards to you. All of us are going to England. Stop pretending. It's all right. But my brother is dating a Catholic girl. I don't like it. Sir! Sir! - Who is it? You! Come in. Please don't abuse me anymore. Let bygones be bygones. Dad, somebody is here to see you. Why are you scolding me? I only apologized for my mistake. Was that you? Take your seat. I didn't come here to ask for your money. Sit down! Sir, I found this stuff today. When I purchased goods for my shop a vendor presented this to me. Oh, it's whisky. - Yes. What brand is it? - It's imported. This is a well-known brand. I don't drink. Our religion is against it. - What? I'm not supposed to drink. It's a sin for us. So, I was wondering whom I could gift this to. And then it struck, you're the right person to gift it to. So, I got it for you. - Julie. Ask mom to get some water. Wonderful whisky! - What? Wonderful whisky. - Okay. Did you understand? - You just said it. I said, it's a good brand. - Yes, it's an imported one. Darling! Look what Mr. Rahim has got us. Come on! Come. Oh, I've spilt water. Sorry.. We'll start buying things from Rahim's shop again. Not only that we'll also pay him off his dues, in instalments. - Yes, dear. Darling, you didn't greet him. Don't you have some manners? - Right now I want nothing. - Okay, you must have a little. No, thanks. A little. - No, we consider it as a sin. I won't disappoint you. I'll have a piece of meat. Okay. I'll take a piece of meat. It's fantastic pork! - Oh, no! Darling, you have a peg too. Today is the day I have sorted out the differences with Rahim. Have it. - No. - Then I'll have it. Sir, I have to go back to my shop. Bye, ma'am. Bye, Ms. Julie. Dad, you've had enough. No, I want to have more. - Come and sleep. I want to drink. - Stop it. You will die a dog's death some day if you drink so much. I want to drink and dance. I'm going to dance. I only had three.. Dad. Come inside. You don't pay heed to my words. Careful! Morris. Oh, no! You threw up blood. Oh, my God! Ilin, call the doctor! Lie down. - Slowly. Dad, what happened? Ilin! No more talking, Dad. - My child.. Dad. - Yes? I'll get your dinner by the time you return. - Okay. Please don't have anything from outside. - No, dear. Here's your medicine. Dad, please don't drink hereafter. Why does a man drink? I'm a happy man. If I save the money I spend on drinking I can buy myself a liver soup. You're too weak, Dad. So, what? I feel quite energetic today. I won't drink even for next Christmas. Thank God, you realized that at least now. I realized the after effects of alcohol now. It's too late. Julie. I want to buy some liver and make some soup for your dad. You take it for him at night. I want you to help me in the kitchen today. I have invited Mr. Pillai for dinner. - Okay, Mom. Julie, there's someone outside to see you. - Who is it? I didn't check out. You go and see. Hi, Sasi. - Hi. When did you come? - It's been two days. I didn't know. As we had a holiday in college, I didn't meet Usha. Usha gave this for you when I told her, I'd be passing this way. Thank you. Usha has asked you to come home whenever you're free. Okay, bye. Who was it? It was Usha's brother. Where is he? - He left. Why did he come? Usha had sent this book for me. She also asked me to go to her place. Why didn't you call him inside? You have no manners, Julie. Shouldn't we call a guest inside and offer him something? Usha! Usha. Where's Usha? There's no one at home. They have gone for a marriage. They'll come only after two days. I lied to you as I wanted to see you. I'll leave. Please, let me go. Are you so scared of me? Someone will see us. No one will. No, please. No, please. Sasi, please. Julie, please sit down. No, Sasi. Let me go. You may go if you want to. I won't compel you to stay back. Sasi, please. I'm afraid. - Why? Someone will come. - No one will come. Sasi, what if your dad and mom discover this? So, what? I don't care for them. Let them go to hell. Sasi, please.. Come on, Julie. Julie, I like you. Let me go, Sasi. - Will you go away so soon? I want to go. Are you upset with me? - No. After two days, they'll return. And then, I will leave. When will you return? Not very soon. By the time I return, you'll have another boyfriend. Sasi, I don't want anyone. Not even me? Sasi.. You mean the world to me. Oh, my darling, Julie. Sasi, please.. Sasi. Sasi, be careful. Shall I go now? Will you come again? You must come, if you like me. Oh! - What happened, Julie? Nothing. You sleep. Julie. Sasi.. - Oh, darling. Are you drunk? A little. I was getting bored sitting alone. I didn't expect you to drink. Why? Don't you drink? Occasionally, I do, but I don't like to. But you're drinking here. In this house.. No. Oh! Please come, Julie. - Sasi. 'Alcohol consumption is injurious to health.' No. Please. Come on, Julie. Sasi.. "Julie.." "Yes, darling?" "I love you." "Oh! You're my sweet heart." "I love you." "Julie.." "I love you." "I love you." "Oh! My Julie.." "How many doors does your dream have?" "Just one door." "Oh! My Julie.." "How many doors does your dream have?" "It has only one door." "Which is the creeper that's climbing up on that door?" "It's a creeper." "Which is the flower that's grown on the creeper?" "It's a red rose." "Julie.." "I love you." "I love you." "Oh! My Julie.." "How many strings does your guitar have?" "Just one string." "Oh! My Julie." "How many strings does your guitar have?" "It has only one string." "What song is the string playing right now?" "It's a love song." "What is the essence of the stanza of it?" "Honeydew. It's a honeydew." "Julie.." "Yes, darling." "I love you." "Oh! You're my sweetheart." "I love you." Sasi.. Let me go home. No, Julie. Please. It's getting late. - Please, Julie. Mom will scold me. - No. Please, Sasi. Please. No, Julie. Come on. I won't let you go. Please, Sasi. Leave me. Please.. Please. Julie. Why did you come, Richard? - Your mom sent me. What for? - To fetch you. Okay. Who were all there at Usha's place? Why do you want to know? - I didn't see anyone outside. We were inside. Why was the door closed? Did you come inside and see? - No, I didn't. I can smell whisky from you. - What? You smell of whisky. - Let it be. Should I tell your mom? - Go to hell. Thank you, Richard. - No mention. When will Mr. Warrier, his wife and daughter return? I won't tell anyone about it. But I feel sad for you, Julie. Dad! Dad, Julie passed in her exams. - Is it? - Yes. Julie! Julie.. - Yes, Dad. Julie! Congratulations, my daughter. Congratulations. Thanks, Dad. - Congratulations.. - Dad. Wait for my results. I will pass too. I'll buy you a fantastic wrist watch. A beautiful wrist watch. - Thank you, Dad. Let her go for further studies. It'll be good if she has a bachelor's degree when we go to London. Margarette, I'm very happy today. To celebrate this happiness, I want to drink today. Please, Dad. Don't drink. - No, Dad. I'm so happy. Just a little. You can drink what I offer you. Don't ask for more. Okay? - Okay. Julie, what's wrong with you? Why are you not talking to anyone? What are you thinking, sitting alone? Nothing, Mom. No.. Maybe.. S-Sasi.. It's true. Oh, Sasi.. I will tell him. I must tell him. You came on the right time. Sasi is leaving today. Where is he going? - He got a job in Thiruvananthapuram. Sasi, be very careful there. Don't lead a lavish life as you will be alone over there. If one likes to lead a lavish life, let them do so. Am I right, Julie? Once children grow up, we shouldn't advise and try to mend their ways. You better leave before the inauspicious time begins. Don't forget to go to the temple, every evening. Bye, Dad. - Bye. Bye, Mom. See you, Usha. Send us a telegram as soon as you reach. - Okay, Dad. Bye. Come, Julie. Come in. I'm in a hurry to leave. - Then why did you come? I came to see Usha. - Come. Did you know Sasi was leaving today? You made it on time. Why are you quiet? Nothing, Usha. Bye. Oh! Julie. Julie. What's wrong with you, my child? Julie! What happened to you, dear? Tell me. What happened? What? - Oh, no! Please kill me, Mom. Kill me. Mom, I'm so sorry. I'm very sorry. I'm so sorry, Mom. Julie, what's wrong with you? What has happened to you? Tell me. What happened? Mom.. - What? Oh, my.. Oh, no! Oh, my God! Who is he? Who is it? Mom.. - I'm asking you, who is responsible! I'm asking you. Sasi. Mom, it's Sasi. You.. Julie! - Mom! How dare you! I will kill you. You witch! I'll kill you. - Kill me. I'll kill you. Oh, my God. Mom.. Oh, my Julie.. You fool! How dare you write a letter to him! You've already committed a blunder. Do you want him to marry you now? I will kill you. Get up! - No, Mom. I said, get up! Wipe off your tears. Don't utter a word about this to anyone. Do you understand? Not even your dad should know about it. Got it? From your expressions no one should suspect anything fishy. I will do whatever needs to be done. Go and wash your face. Dad, what's this? I feel very restless and disturbed today. I feel very depressed. I want to drink to overcome that. You want to drink when you're happy. You want to drink when you're sad and also when worried. Is there a time when you don't want to drink? My dear, let me tell you. Your mother and I know each other since 25 years. Today is the first time she has said something intelligent. So, here I drink for your good health. I'm going to send Julie to a convent school for a job. No, let her study. - No. Why, Mom? We have no other source of income. After Jimmy has left, we have only your salary to survive. How will we pay for her education? I'll sell my car if required. I'm looking for a buyer. Dad, few people came and saw it. See.. They said, we will have to pay them enough money to take it from us. Bloody rascals! They don't know, my car is an imported one. Dad. Let us arrange for an auction. No one will pay anything for it. I have decided. Julie needs a job. I'd written to one of my friends. I'll be taking Julie to Ernakulam for an interview, tomorrow. If she gets the job, I'll send her. What do you say, my girl? Come on, tell me. I'll do as mom says. - Okay. Okay. Hi, Julie. Come in. Why did you leave immediately yesterday? Were you depressed as Sasi went? I'm leaving this place forever. To England. - No. Then? I don't know. To the place where mom sends me to. - But why? To save our reputation. What happened? Tell me, Julie. Usha. I came here in your absence. - What for? It just happened. I made a mistake. Usha.. I'm pregnant, Usha. Sasi! I cannot keep secrets from you. I came to bid goodbye. I'm leaving today itself. I have a request. Usha, please don't tell this to anyone. Not even to your brother. If someone discovers this, my mom will kill me. Usha I'll take your leave. Aunt. I'm Margarette. Oh, my God. This is my daughter, Julie. Hello. Come in. Please be seated. Aunt, could you please come aside? No.. I will never support you for that. It's a sin. No. Aunt, please. Please help me for the sake of my daughter's future. It's something that will put our entire community to shame. An Indian betrayed her. Aunt, please. No. Let's go and see a doctor. Aunt, please help me. Julie. We have taken a decision. You're going to stay here. Aunt will make all necessary arrangements. You won't have any problem. The doctor did not agree. Don't cry, Julie. Don't cry. Dear, I'll keep posting you about everyone at home through letters. Make sure, you don't reveal this secret in your replies. Aunt will write to me about you. I won't stay here for long. I'm returning today. No, Mom. - Julie.. - Don't leave me, Mom.. Mom. Dear.. Mom.. Mom.. Oh, God. Johny, somebody is at the door. Mom! - Dad, mom is back. Why did you return so early? Didn't the interview take place? Where's Julie, Mom? They appointed Julie immediately after the interview. Very good! I arranged for her stay and returned. I'm too tired. I want a drink. This is the first time I'm having dinner without my daughter. When will Julie return? She won't get leaves till she completes at least 8-10 months. How much will she be paid? - Rs. 250. Is it? I'll go to see Julie during my next vacation. I'm also coming with you. We'll decide that later. When I get my salary this month I'll buy a wrist watch and courier it to her. Sure. A beautiful wrist watch! I'm really very tired. Shall I go and lie down? Good night. - Good night. Good night. Dear. Julie. Yes, Aunt. Do you want to have milk? Thank you, Aunt. You go to sleep. Good night. - Good night. Julie! Julie. Dad will buy you a beautiful watch. A nice watch.. Julie.. Is this because he drank too much or is it the disease? He was drunk when he returned. But this is not because of drinking. Dad.. Dad. - Darling. - A nice watch.. Let's take him to a hospital immediately. I'll get a car. A nice watch! Julie.. Darling. - A nice watch. Darling. - Dad. - Julie.. Darling.. - Julie. A nice watch. - Dad. Julie.. Dear. Julie. Yes, Aunt? When God loves us a lot he takes our life. Ma'am! That's what we call death. What happened, Aunt? Tell me. Tell me, Aunt. God has taken away your dad. He is no more. Dear. Julie.. Dear. Julie! My dad.. Aunt.. Dad.. Aunt. Julie.. Post! It must be Julie's letter. For whom? - For you. - Don't open it. Don't you have manners? Do I ever read the letters that come for you? Is Julie fine? - Yes, she is. Go and sit down, there. When she heard about dad's death she fell ill and was admitted to a hospital. That's the reason she couldn't come. She has resigned from her job. I'll go and fetch her tomorrow. - Good. We'll also join you, Mom. No. It will be too expensive. I'll go alone. Please, Mom. - I said, no. Julie. Mom.. Mom.. Dear let bygones be bygones. Your dad was calling out to you even when he breathed his last. We need to pray for his soul, every day. Dad.. My dad.. Buying a watch for you was his last wish. As soon as I received his salary, I bought a watch for you. Here it is. Dad.. Don't cry, my child. - Mom.. Dear, we have to return today itself. I've told everyone that you have resigned. Get ready to leave. There's nothing to pack or get ready. Let us go. Don't take the child. What? I've explained everything to aunt. She'll hand him over to an orphanage. Mom! No.. No, Mom. My son will live with me. I won't go without him. Julie. - Don't say a word! I don't want to hear anything. I'm not coming home. I will go away to some place with my son and live my life. Mom, you may go back. Please go. Julie, my child. Don't say anything. Son.. My son. My dear son.. Dear. Julie.. - Aunt. I won't go. Julie, do as your mom says. No, Aunt. Julie, what will you tell everyone if you take him home? Your family's reputation will be tarnished. Ilin will also not get a suitable match. Your dad who is no more, his name will be tarnished. Dear. Do as your mom says. Go with her. - No, Aunt. He'll be raised well in an orphanage. No.. - Listen to what your mom says. No! Julie, come on. It's time to leave. Come on.. Aunt. Bye, Aunt. Come on, Julie. It's time for the bus. - My son. Julie. Aunt, my child.. Come, Julie. Come, Julie. We're getting late. Aunt.. - Come. Carry the suitcase. Come on. Come, dear. We're getting late. Mom. Mom.. Mom, my son is hungry. Shall I go back? I say, come on. - Please! Get up. Pick up your briefcase. Come on, pick it up. Come on. Julie, stop crying. Hi, Julie. Come. Julie! Julie.. Why are you disturbing her? Come on, take this in. Go inside. Julie, come inside. Good evening, Julie. Good evening. - How are you? How are you, Richard? Is your baby fine? Julie, I'm sorry. See you later. 'You're right, my daughter. If one misbehaves, you must slap him.' 'I'll buy you a beautiful wrist watch.' Dad.. Dad. Please forgive me. Forgive me, dad. I'm so sorry, Dad. Julie. I heard that you're back. I came. Julie. Did you come alone? Your baby.. I'll tell you, Usha. Who else will I share it with? I'll tell you everything. Oh, God! Don't you hear the baby crying? Feed him milk. Julie. Julie.. - Yes? What is it, Ilin? Why were you standing there? Nothing. I know everything. What? So, was this your job in the convent? No, Ilin. Oh, my God! Julie.. - My God! I'm sorry, Julie. I'm sorry, Julie. It's okay. You sleep. Please go to sleep. Mom. Mom! Yes, dear. What's wrong? Mom, I cannot hide it anymore. I want to see my son. I want to see my child. - Shut up! Go and sleep. Mom.. You're a mother too. Mom, please.. Do you want to see your son? Yes, Mom. You will see me dead before that. Mom.. Yes. Send her in. Come in. Good morning, sir. Good morning. Sit down. Thank you, sir. What can I do for you? After dad's demise things have taken an ugly turn. Jimmy has left to England. None of us have a job. Mom sent me to see you. If you could help me with a job.. Oh! A job.. For now I'll appoint you as a telephone operator. Are you happy? Thank you, sir - Sit down. I'll pay you a salary of Rs.250. Wow! You're too kind. How nice. Sir.. - Don't be silly. Is this how you are? Do you think we're prostitutes? Don't pretend to be virtuous. I've seen many Anglo Indian girls. Mr. Pillai, mind your words! I don't want your job. Shucks! You're so lecherous! Hello, Julie. How do you do, darling? What's wrong, Julie? Have you forgotten me? I came two days back. I asked Usha, but she said nothing. When can we meet? Never again. Stop talking nonsense. Get in, let's go. Somebody will see us. Let me go, Sasi. How does it matter? Aren't you mine? Please, Sasi. - I have so many things to tell you. No. - Come on, Julie. Please. Julie.. What do you mean, Julie? Hiding it from everyone in this town I gave birth to your child. And I gifted him to an orphanage. No! Oh, my God! I'm a sinner, Sasi. What have you done, Julie? My God! Julie. I'll marry you. Will you marry me? Sasi.. - Yes, Julie, I mean it. Sasi.. I cannot live without my child. Oh, my God! - I'm ready to do anything for him. I don't care about our religion or caste. I want to live with my child, Sasi. Sasi.. - Julie, don't weep.. You may get off. Yes, darling. Wait for me under the bridge, tomorrow. Sasi.. I'll ask for everyone's consent. Should I really wait for you? Please do that, darling. Just for me. Okay. Bye, Sasi. - Bye, darling. Oh, my God. Julie! Oh, my Julie.. Darling. Darling Julie.. Sasi, did your dad agree? Dad was never a problem. My mom has consented. Did you tell them we have a child? No, I didn't tell them now. That will worsen the issue. We'll tell that later. I told them I love you and want to marry you. Oh, my goodness! - Julie.. I never expected this. He is simply great, Sasi. Mom wants to see you. Let's go immediately. - Really? Come in. Sasi. You need not interfere in ladies' talk. You stay away from it. Come inside. That's all right. Times are changing. I have stopped following such customs. Come in. Be seated. No. - Have a seat. So, have you decided to marry? Yes, we have. You're a Christian and he is a Hindu. Will your marriage work? I won't make any mistakes. I'm ready to bear with anything. Sit down. Please sit. Sasi is crazy. You don't get carried away by his words. It will ruin your future. So, you better tell him that you don't want to marry him. Ma'am, please don't compel me. I cannot part ways with Sasi. Shut up, you witch! Ma'am! - Stop it! You want to marry my son! Do you know who he is? Get out of here! I say, get out! I say, get out of here! Get out! - Mom! Are you mad? - No, I am not. You are mad. - Get out! Julie, stay here. - Don't utter a word! I will kill you! - You.. Mom! Don't misbehave with her. What? Get out. - Julie! Julie, don't go. Let her go. Julie, I said, don't go. Julie! Yes, Mom? We're so fortunate. We're so lucky. Julie, there was a telegram. We're going to England immediately. We're going to Chennai by tomorrow's train. Jimmy has arranged for our passport and tickets. Just one day's journey. After that, we'll be in our own country. We're so lucky, Julie. - Come on, go and pack. Quick! - Yes, Mom. - Come on. This is what your son has done. You have spoiled him. Sasi. Sasi! Is what your mom said, true? Is it true? Yes. - What? Slap him on his face! Had you chosen to marry a girl from any caste in Hindu I would have agreed to it. You couldn't find anyone but an Anglo Indian, Christian girl! She is an uncouth and ill-mannered girl. She.. - She isn't ill-mannered. Then, is your father? Your son! My brother, the son of a mother who worships thrice a day. He sweet talked her and made her pregnant. Is this true? Yes. Poor girl! She is the mother of a child, today. Johny told me you want to dispose of all your furniture and things. Richard, help us get a better rate. I will try. - Thank you. As soon as we reach our land, Julie will find a job. Should I try for you, Richard? Why, not? - Sure? - Yes. Would you like to have tea or coffee? - I want nothing. You must have something. Come on, sit down. I'll get you coffee. - All right. Julie! - Yes, Mom? Come, dear. I'm coming. Hello, Richard. - Hello, - How are you? Julie, why are you always worried? I'm there for you. I have hurt you enough, Richard. Let us forget the past. Let your mom and siblings go to the UK. Let us live here. Julie, I'll marry you. Richard, please.. Bring it. Good morning, sir. - Good morning. I heard that you and family are leaving to England today. Yes, we're going by the Madras Mail. We'll be in Chennai for two weeks. Some special claims in the name of Mr. Morris have been sanctioned. It's around Rs. 3,000. You may collect it if you want. Thank you so much, sir. Before you leave from Chennai I will try to arrange for it. - Thank you, sir. If not to anyone else but I'm indebted to Mr. Morris. But I want you all to sign a document. Will there be enough time before the train arrives? Okay, do one thing. Come to my house on your way to the railway station. I'll get the file ready. Sure, sir. We'll be there. Come on, go and get other things. Bye, ma'am. Julie, I'll take your leave. I'm not coming to the station to see you off. Good bye. Please come in. Have a seat. Sit down. - Thank you, sir. I want you all to sign this paper. Are you not sad to leave this country? No, I'm very happy, sir. - Is it? Devaki! - Have you met my wife? I have seen her. Julie knows everyone in my family. Don't you know her? She is Julie's mom. Glad to meet you. Sasi.. He is my son, Sasi. If you're in a hurry to leave, you may carry on. I will make the necessary arrangements to get this claim. Once you reach England, send me your address. Usha? - Usha. I'm coming, Dad. Yes, Dad? He is my son's child. He had to live in an orphanage for some days. Oh, my son. You should not have done this, in the last minute. This is not the last, but the first minute, Ms. Morris. This is the first minute when we don't rely on orphanages or follow dirty traditions. If a Hindu and Christian can have such an adorable child it means, neither Lord Krishna nor Lord Jesus is against the union of both the religions. None of you will go to England. England is not your motherland. India is your country. We're relatives from now. We will continue to live as one family. Julie and Sasi's son is neither a Hindu nor a Christian. He is an Indian citizen.
