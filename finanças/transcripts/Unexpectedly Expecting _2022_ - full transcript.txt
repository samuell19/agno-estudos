Hello? - Hi. - Hi, who's this? - An admirer. - That's nice. Do I know you? I don't know. Maybe you've seen me around. Tell me, where did you get my phone number? Let's just say I always get what I want. Sure. Okay. I hope you get everything you want, but I have to hang up now. - Are you in a hurry? - No, but I'm busy. Nothing some pasta and good wine can't fix. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. Are you okay? - Yes, honey. I'm okay. But don't stop, I'm still in character. I know. - The safe word is "jumpsuit." - "Jumpsuit." Yes, we only stop if you say that. Yes, I wanted to see if you were okay. I'm okay, don't worry. Okay. - Should we continue? - Okay. Okay, let's get back to position. You're here chopping something, and I'll enter... - Let's go on from here. - Where? From here. - The eggs! The eggs! - I'm getting a cramp! - Like this. - Like this. Did you finish? - No. - No? - No. - No? - Honey... - What? - It was barely 35 seconds. - Were you counting? No. I'm sorry. The masked man has been chasing you for a while now and it must be hard to work with all that anxiety within. - Poor masked man. - Poor guy. - I pity him. - Me too. But don't worry because I can fix that now. - Come here. - I'd love that, but I can't. - I can't. - Why not? - It's my bachelorette party. - Really? I'm going out with the girls. - Out partying? - Yes. And are you going dancing with your hats with the shape of... - Of what? - Of it falling - and these things hanging. - Say it. Say it, hats with the shape of... With the shape of... - Of? - The shape of a penis. - Penis. - Yes. Hats with the shape of a penis. That's right. - No, I won't do that. - No? No, we're too old for that. Nice work, girls. Call me if something happens. And don't drink too much, you forget everything. - Me? - Yes, you. - Me? - Yes, you, damn. Remember your birthday? You jumped on the counter, and started puking on everyone? Yes. People started running, covering their faces. - You're lying! - You were going... Like that girl from The Exorcist. - No. It's been three years. - And? I've matured. Delete that memory from your head. - I'm erasing it. - Do it. Have fun and enjoy your night. Can I open them now? No! Move it. Scooch. Scooch. Okay. - Can I open them? - Not yet. - Now? - Please, behave. - Now? - No! - I want to open them! - Okay, open them. Wow! Cheers to your new life. - Cheers! - Cheers! - Ready to get married? - Yes! - Are you sure? - Yes. - You can't regret it later. - No. This is a one-way ticket. And there are a bunch of men around the world. Although, most of them are insensitive and selfish. - And immature. - And irresponsible. - And unstable. - Dickheads. - Dickheads. - Dickheads! - Dickheads! - They're not worth it and a bunch of mamma's boys! Okay, Cata. But I don't care about other men. But there's another kind of men who are good in bed, but they're assholes. So not one of them is the full package, and want to do a Frankenstein, with the face of one, the sense of humor of another, the sexual potency... Cata. Cata. Cata. Javier is the man of my life. I don't need nor do I want to look for no one else. Okay. I can't believe you're getting married. - I'm so happy for you! - Me too. - Let's make a toast. Cheers! - Cheers! - Cheers to this side! - Cheers! The other side! To the bride of the year and all the good men in the world. - Okay. - In every sense of the word. Because just being good at one thing is not enough! Keep partying. Cheers. Bye! Shut up, okay? Cheers. Last one. - From the first round. - No. Cristina, you'll be married in a month. - Yes. - Drink some more. - No. - Cheers. Such a good friend. Two more. Bottoms up! Yeah! Give me more. Stop! More, more. Cheers. Cheers! Yeah! Take it. Take it. - Dear God. - What's wrong? I just saw the sexiest guy in the country. Not just the country, in the world. No, the solar system. - In the galaxy! Handsome! - I don't think that's true. - Which one? - The only one who's worth it. - Which one? - The one over there. I can't believe it. What? No, this is mineral water. Really. Cristina, I know you as if you were my daughter. Do you know him? Yes. He's my ex from college. I mean, we were in high school and then in college. He was my first love. - Felipe? - Yes! - Your Felipe? - Yes, that's Felipe. He doesn't look like the pictures. Of course, it's been over ten years. What's his name on social media? It's a good one. Felipe-saves-the-planet. - Felipe saves the planet? - Yes! Oh, my God. - Let's see. - I'm going to look it up. Yes. I can't believe it. Cristina, you have a problem. I'm sorry to tell you this, but what's wrong with you? Why did you let him go? What's wrong with you? - Are you stupid? - No. - Felipe! - No! - Felipe! Felipe! - No! - Yes, yes. - What are you doing? Good luck, bye. Cristina? Felipe. Wow. It's been so long. How are you? A bit dazed by the noise, but... I think people like this. Yes! They like this. That's what I've realized. And... - What are you doing here? - I don't know. Well, it's my friend's birthday... Can you imagine the number of energies that had to align for us to meet? - Sure! - We should celebrate this. I haven't had a drink in a while, but this deserves one, right? No. No. I mean, it's nice to see you, but I'm drinking water now. I had like two, three, four... Like eight shots of pure pisco. Eight? We haven't seen each other for like eight years? - At least ten years. - Ten years? Do you remember? - When we go to college? - Oh, right! We did that dance. One drink and one song. No, I'm drinking water now. Baby, close the curtains, please. I have a headache. Come on. Goddamn. What did I do? What did I do? What did I do? What did I do? It's a dream. It's a dream. It's a dream. No. It's not a dream. Pick up, Catalina. Please. UNEXPECTEDLY EXPECTING A MONTH LATER - Honey! - What? Try this new cake. - New? - For good luck. - Good luck? - Yes. Let's try it. How is it? You should start your own bakery. That's a good idea. - Today's the day, right? - Yes. Don't worry, it's going to be okay. They're going to love your project. I hope so. I think something big is coming. I'm sure. As a prize, I'll bring you a piece of the best cake from the bakery. Just a piece? Don't be so stingy. Okay, an entire cake, - but it'll be diet. - Why? Because I want you to look handsome in your wedding suit. Don't worry, I'll look okay. I promise I'll start with the routine my Uncle Silvester did. - Are you going to exercise? - Sure. - You? - Me. You have five exercise machines gathering dust. What's important is to not lose motivation. I love your optimism. I have to go now. I'm in a hurry. Good luck. Fix your tire, okay? I'll do that after work. - I promise. Good luck. - Bye. - Honey! - What? Fix your tire. Okay. - Good luck. - For you too. Thank you. Where are you? Remember tomorrow we have to deliver ten cakes. I know. This order might either help us or ruin us. The client is an influencer. If she doesn't like it, she'll destroy us on social media. That's right. So focus and take notes. We can't make a mistake. Remember the last time you mixed the orders. Guys, the cake is here! Look at the cake we got for you, honey! Cover it! Cover it! No! No! Yes, that was bad. She even wanted to sue me. What a lack of sense of humor. I bet you she ate the whole thing, even the balls that were filled with cream. Stop! I'll be there in five. Hi, girls. Good morning. Hi, sweetie. - Hey. - Hey. Hello, everyone! Om Shanti. Namaste! That's right, I like feeling that energy. Remember, the key to success is believing in yourselves. Felipe, the journalist has been waiting for half an hour. Right. Thank you, Milu. Love you. How is that going? - It's going fine. - Good. Hey, Nico. - Hi, Jean Paul! - Felipe! Tell me, Felipe. What is it like to be the owner of one of the most successful apps in the world? According to the polls, you're in the sixth position worldwide. That must make you proud, right? Well, times change, but the experience of sharing, the joy of helping without waiting for anything in return, that's still the same. Every dog that's found fills my heart with joy. And it's not just me, it's every wonderful person here with me. And if we had to define your role in this company, what would it be? A manager... ...of energies. I take care of people feeling motivated and at peace. That's the key for me. We do yoga on Tuesday and Thai Chi on Thursday. We like to keep the energy alive. If you want to de-stress someday, you're welcome to come. Â¡Ah! Damn. No, damn. Damn, no. Goddamn. No! I'd like to know where you got the idea to create this app. That story warms my heart. Approximately, seven or eight years ago, my dog Chupacabra disappeared. He was a gift from my parents before they died. Losing him was like losing a part of me. I searched for him day and night nonstop. Those were the worst days of my life. And when I started giving up, he showed up. He was hit by a car. They hit him and then left him on the street, dying. He lost his back legs. And right then I thought, "This can't keep happening. I have to create something so others don't have to go through this terrible and painful experience." That day GB Dog was born. It's been a truly heartwarming interview. Thank you for welcoming us, Felipe. Namaste. Hi. Hey. Are you okay? Yes, I'm okay. Let's start. Last year was a good year for our firm. We signed an agreement to develop three shopping malls and four grocery stores, which is amazing. But I think we still can develop a more integral view of this. - Go ahead. Get to the point. - Sure. Take this. I've been working for some time on a sustainable housing project with integrated solar panels, as you can see here and here too. And what we're looking for with this is, first, to be respectful to the environment, and second, to make better use of the resources to lower the energy consumption and, with that, the family expenses. I think it's time to worry about our planet. And if we look at it in a more calculated way, I think this might help our company image. That's interesting. So these are houses for the poor? No, no. These are not houses for the poor. These are houses for low-income people... ...who are poor, yes. Okay. Very interesting. First of all, I liked your work and your enthusiasm. We really like the work you've done as the manager of the Interior Design Department. And that's why this goes a bit beyond your expertise. Now, what we can do... ...is to... ...throw it out the window. Just kidding. No, we could take this to the nursery so kids can play with the little houses. For now. It's pretty. Do you want some coffee? - No, thank you. - I do. Go get me one. - Right away. - It's pretty. Walk straight, I'm watching you. - How is it? - What do you think? This is how I want my wedding cake. - I like it. - Yes! Isn't Javier shorter? You're so bad, Cata. - But yes, he's shorter. - I'm just joking. Since you're done, why don't you help us with the orders? Okay, okay. I'll send a picture to Javi. Okay. Are you okay, Cristina? - Yes, just a second. - Okay. No, not on the cakes. Breathe. Breathe. I'm okay. No, not there either. Let's go to the bathroom. You went partying and didn't tell me, right? No. I spent the night watching a movie with Javi. Maybe it was the sushi we ordered. Maybe you're pregnant. It was just a joke, sorry. Cristina... False alarm, girl. Not pregnant. Yes! I swear I would've died if I was. Don't you know how to read this? I do. - How old are you? Ten? - No. Two lines, Catalina. Two lines. I'm pregnant. I thought two lines meant you weren't. Congratulations! You've always wanted a baby with Javier. - It can't be happening. - Go ahead, call him. He'll finally have someone to play with his toy cars... - I can't. - Why not? What's wrong? What? I don't understand. I don't know who's the father. What? Are you okay? You're worrying me. Did something happen? - Is it the bakery? - No. Were you mugged? Did a masked man try to take advantage of you? Do you love me? Of course I love you. What happened? I'm pregnant. What? Wow. Wow. I mean... You're... I mean, we are... We're going to be parents? Yes. I'm pregnant. Goddamn, Cristina. You freaked me out. I thought something bad happened to you. How long have you known? Tell me, please. There's something else. What's wrong? Hey. Hey, hey. Sweetie, calm down. Everything's going to be okay. I know it's scary, but it's a new experience and we're together in this. It's not about that. Then what's wrong? I don't know who's the father. What did you just say? Hello. By the look on you, I'm guessing she just told you. - Excuse me, who are you? - I'm Felipe. - Cristina's ex. - Felipe, I said I'd text you after talking to Javier. I waited for a while after he came in as you said. Honey, let me explain. I wanted this to be as clear as possible, that's why I called Felipe, told him what happened, and asked him to come. I tried telling you first, many times, but I couldn't do it. I hope we can talk about what happened. I don't understand. Are you telling me that you... I mean, you two met each other and... Sweetie, let's try to be civilized. It's not easy for me... Civilized? What is civilized about sleeping with your ex a month before getting married? Maybe I'm too stupid to understand. - Javier... - Felipe. Javier, sweetie, things are not like you think. Please, let me explain. Are you kidding, Cristina? Do you realize what you're telling me? Sweetie. Don't "sweetie" me. Do you know what hurts the most? First, you slept with your ex a month before getting married. Second, that you didn't tell me. And third, that there's a chance that this hippie is the father of my son. Well, the child's father. You're child... I'm sorry. I'm sorry, it was a mistake. This is not a mistake, Cristina. You messed up. - It sucks. - Javier, believe her. This was a mistake. In fact, for what it's worth, neither of us remembers what happened that night. It was more of a spiritual connection rather than a physical. Thank you. I feel better now. Way better. Thank you. I understand what you feel. If I were in your place, I would feel the same, but the best thing you can do now is to breathe. Take a deep breath and let your ego behind. Let's find a way to be the best family possible. - Family? - Did you say family? - Family. - He said family. No! Javier! - Careful! - Javier! There is no pain, it's all in our heads. What are you doing? There is no pain, it's all in our heads. Remove that fork! LIVE WITH LOVE LET YOURSELF TO BE SEEN Hurrah for the bride and groom! Congratulations! LIE TO ME I'M GOING TO LOVE YOU SINCE I HAVE YOUR LOVE Javier. Javier. Don't talk to me. I don't want to know anything about you or the passionate night you spent with your ex. I want you to know that I'm really sorry for what happened. I got wasted and I screwed it up. I know there's no excuse, but I never intended for this to happen. Maybe you didn't intend to, but your body agreed to do it. - I understand how you feel. - No, you don't. You're right, I don't. But I'm trying to put myself in your shoes, and I'd be feeling the same anger, sadness, and disappointment that you must be feeling right now. All I can do now is say sorry. I can't. I can't forgive you. Can we please move on from this? - Really? - Yes. Tell me how. How? I don't know. See? Give me another one. Another one? - Yes. - Full? Full. Calm down, Cristina. He's going to come back. That's how men are. They're territorial, selfish, arrogant... Besides, he's a bit hurt, don't you think? Of course! I screw up big time. You have no memory of it. Thalia said, "Can't remember, didn't happen." I just remember talking to him, like normal, then we had a tequila shot, and then nothing more. Absolutely nothing. I opened my eyes, and I woke up in a stranger's house and when I turned around, I see... - That handsome man. - Ah! If I could turn back time. I have to accept it was a bit my fault because I called him. But I thought you would only talk, not start immediately procreating. - Okay. - I'm sorry. Were you doing good? You and Javier. Yes. Yes. We had fights like any other couple, but we were fine. Maybe it was the stress of the wedding, I don't know. Maybe deep, deep down you didn't want to get married. I was a little scared that my relationship became more serious. Less spontaneous and more formal by being married. But nothing, nothing, nothing made me doubt how I felt for Javier. See? See? I'm starting to talk in past tense! Calm down, Cristina. Relax. Javier loves you, he just has to get over his fiancÃ© sleeping with the ex-love of her life. That's all. Listen, I made you these brownies yesterday at the bakery. I added a bit of happiness. I made them for you, so you can relax and calm down. Eat them. It'll be good for you. I ate a few of them the other day and I looked at myself in the mirror for two hours and wonder if it was my reflection or if it was me, but skinnier. - Has that happened to you? - No, Catalina. It hasn't. Namaste. Who are all these people? Om Shanti. Om Shanti. Well, since there are a lot of possibilities that this being of light is my son, it's time to take responsibility. That's why I'm here, to be near you. That way when you need something, whatever it is, I'll be here to help. Of course, I don't want to be too invasive or anything, I've got some bamboo and we're going to build in the garden. Are you insane? If Javier sees you, he'll kill you. Don't worry, this is temporary. Where do we start, sir? First, we need to check if the ground is firm enough. If it is, then we can start. - We can't work at night. - Listen, Felipe. I don't know how to say this, but I don't need anyone. I'm fine by myself. So gather all these people and your tent and go. This will be a hit on my stories. Shut up, Catalina. Look, I really appreciate this. It's really nice, but when Javier comes back... Javier left? Yes, but he's coming back. Okay. Then if he doesn't like this when he comes back, I'll leave. In that instant. I promise. But for now, let me stay here. The first months of pregnancy can be tricky, and I wouldn't forgive myself if I wasn't here to help you. You can see it this way, you will keep living in your own world and I'll be over there, in my world. What unites us is this simmering and vivid energy that you're carrying. Okay. Stay. But don't do anything. Let's start, people. And? Is it strong enough? So nice. Chupi! Hi, Chupi. This is going to be your new home. Come with daddy. Come here. Family? Family. Keep moving. Keep moving. - One, two! - Three, four! - I can't hear you! One, two! - Three, four! You're man enough to commit crimes, but not enough to take responsibility for them, right? No, sir! Is that right? Do you want to rehabilitate? Yes, sir! And the best cure is exercise. - Yes, sir! - I can't hear you! - One, two! - Three, four! - One, two! - Three, four! What's wrong? Nothing. I have a problem. - Do you have a problem? - Yes, it's my back. - Your back? - Yes, it hurts. - Does it hurt bad? - A bit. Poor fellow. Come here, come with me. - Where? - Come, I'll take care of you. - But... - Come on. Come on. I'm watching you! - One, two! - Three, four! - One, two! - Three, four! Baker. Someone's here for you. They bailed you out. Who's her? Come out. What's wrong? Nothing, it's just getting cold. I feel it in my legs. It'll pass. I'm guessing you imagine how mad Cristina is, right? Goddamn. Was any of it saved? Nothing. All ten cakes were lost. We're going to have to make them all again and I don't know if we're going to make it on time. I'm sorry. I just wanted to destroy my cake and not the others. - It was a mistake. - See? That's what Cristina says. It was a mistake. That's the point, we all make mistakes. Okay, but there are mistakes and mistakes, Cata. - Come on! - Listen, Javi. I'm not good at giving advice, but there's something you should know. You have to make a decision. You're either with Cristina in this process or you let mistakes ruin everything. And trust me, I know about mistakes. I'm a specialist. I have a degree in it. You Google mistakes and my name's there. Okay, Cata. I got it. Then fight for her. Look, Felipe is... He's... ...perfect. But you're fine too. So stop doing stupid things and stop wasting time, okay? You know how the saying goes, "Where there once was fire, ashes remain." Javi. Good morning, beautiful. Felipe? Don't worry, it's just a speaker I attached to Chupi's collar. He's cute, right? And very practical too. Yes, very practical. I hope you like breakfast. I tried to balance nutrition with tastiness. Cucumber, mint, and beet extract. Toasts without gluten with quince jelly and quail eggs. All you need for that boy or girl to grow up strong and healthy. Come down when you're done, I have a surprise. Felipe, you said you would be in your own world and now I'm talking to a dog. I told you wouldn't see me, and you haven't seen me. I'll think about it. Okay. Hey. Hey. Woof. Woof. - What? - I like your pajamas. What are you doing? How is it? What do you think? I don't know what to say. If it's Javier's child, I can change the face in just a second, - that won't be a problem. - No. No. No. Leave it. Honestly. It's fine. Okay, as you wish. Mr. Javier. Javivi. - Javicho! - Goddamn! - What happened? - You have a meeting at 12:00. - And what time is it? - 11:55. Damn! Do you want a glass of water? Some tea? An aspirin? - Maybe water with lime... - Just regular water. I'll bring it right away, but, Javier, why don't you go home, and I reschedule the meeting for later or for tomorrow? No. No. No. I'm sorry, but I can't go home. It's just... I have a problem. Javier, I know about that problem. How do you know? - Everybody knows about it. - Everybody? - It's on Pictogram. - Who put it there? Felipe posts everything on social media and he's really famous. I follow him since 2015 when I found my dog thanks to one of his apps. Yes, Felipe is great. In fact, he uploaded a picture of the painting of your girlfriend? Yes. My girlfriend. My future wife. And the mother of that child, my child. I'm sure of that. Actually, I can't. I don't even know who the father is. Even more reason for you to go home. What are you doing, Javier? Showing you that you're not alone. Why don't you come in so we can talk? No. It's not the time. I'm not ready to talk yet. Actually, I wanted to say sorry for what happened at the store. I let myself go by rage, I ruined the entire team's work. I'm sorry. I don't want to be that kind of father. Don't worry, that's settled. That's good. Then, can I show you that I can be a good father? Of course. But this... It doesn't matter, you have to be relaxed and by yourself. I'll be here, close, for everything you need. It's going to be okay. Namaste. It's good that you came back. I think now we can talk about how we're going to be as a family. Hey, didn't that fork in your hand teach you to think before using that word? Javi, the concept of family has changed in recent years. It doesn't necessarily mean a father, a mother and a son. There are also combined and extended families. I don't care. I don't care because we're not going to be a family. Not in a traditional and outdated way or any other kind there is. Javi, if you're uncomfortable because this tent is a bit small, I think mine is big enough and it has a king bed - where we can sleep together. - Thank you, but no. I'm fine here. Are you sure you want to do this? Yes. Well, if we're going to live like this, I'm begging you to act civilized, so this waiting time is as calm as possible, okay? I'm fine with that. I like big families. The bonding and linking, the dynamic... Hold on. What do you think? It's okay. I'll do my best. So exciting. As Osho says, "To accept the challenge of the unknown is the only way to grow." Okay. Okay. Javi. - If you want some coffee... - I'm good, thank you. Hey. Hey, can you stop making that noise, please? It's the energy of the universe. - We just have to be aligned. - I just want to sleep. Please. Please. - Cris. - Yes? Why don't we invite the guys in for a bit? - Here? - Yes. - Inside this house? - It's getting cold outside. - No, it would be uncomfortable. - Yes, it would be. It would be uncomfortable to have them inside the house. - Especially for them. - And for us. - Very uncomfortable. - Very uncomfortable. - That's a point! - That's it! Three hurrahs for the daddies! Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah! - The energy of daddies. - It's my turn. Go sit down. Let's go, daddies! Five, four, three, two, one, action! The Secret in Their Eyes? Eyes Wide Shut. - Love is Blind? - End of Watch? Time. Wandering Eye. Of course. That's a bummer. It's my turn. - I go again. - It's my turn. You haven't guessed any of mine, okay? Cristina, there's an order to this. Embrace defeat. No. Five, four, three, two, one, action! Pan's Labyrinth! - Tarzan! - The Jungle Book! King Kong, on the building. In New York. Seven Years in Tibet. No, the building's on fire. - Man on Fire! - No. - Sniper. - Ghostbusters? Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs! Saving Private Ryan! Miss Congeniality! The Ring. The Passion of the Christ! Sister Act? Time. The Hunchback of Notre Dame. It's obvious! I did everything! I did everything! I did the hunchback balancing on the bell. I acted Notre Dame on fire! I did the firemen who came to put out the fire. The tourists recording it, the people who came to see it. Even the people who prayed! I did everything. - Leave my home. - Me too? No, not you. - Good luck, guys. - To your tents! - I didn't see it. - Me neither. You did great, girl. You did a perfect hunchback. - Are you okay? - Yes. There it is. Okay. - Be careful, slowly. - Okay. - Put some pressure here. - Sure. - Okay. - Better? Uh- huh. I learned to give great massages in Thailand. Is that right? Thai massages have two effects on the physical body. - Restorative and regenerative. - Really? - Do you feel that? - Yes. Do you feel the heat? That's nice. You need to calm down. You need to go through this pregnancy relaxed. Everything is new to me. Every day I experience new emotions. I feel sick, but I'm always starving. I wake up with a lot of energy, but I'm tired. And everything makes me sad. The other day I found a spider in my room, it was tiny, and I killed it. And it made me sad. I felt like I was the worst person in the world, and I started crying. Just like now. - That's normal. - But then it goes away, and I want to kill everyone. And I mean everyone in the world. Sure. Of course. I imagine you're going through a roller coaster of emotions, but remember what Osho says, "To accept the challenge of the unknown is the only way to grow." I just want you to be fine. Thank you. Really. Thank you for everything you're doing. You didn't have to. We still don't know if you're the father. I feel like I am. - Surprise! - Mom? - Sweetie. - Mother-in-law. Dad? Sweetie. You can't imagine how happy it makes me to see you again, Felipe. Honey. When you and my daughter ended your relationship, it broke my heart. Javier is a good kid, he is. But I can't lie, those were hard times. - Mom. - You're so nice, MarÃ­a. I've missed you too. Especially your desserts. I don't eat sugar anymore, but every time I remember those, - my mouth starts watering. - You made desserts? - She still does. - She still does? Yes, MarÃ­a is a great confectionery. I still don't know why you didn't get your own TV show. I didn't know that about you. Since you never made one for me. It's because every time you go home, I lack an ingredient for the recipe, but I promise I'm going to make one just for you. Thank you. Javier, how's the solar houses project going? Good. It's going great. Some time ago we signed an agreement to develop the blueprints for the Government and I'm guessing we'll be done with that by the end of next year. - That's good, Javi. - You didn't tell me. Didn't I? I'm sorry. I must've forgotten about it after the pregnancy. Excuse me? Did I hear pregnancy? - He said that, right? - Yes. You said it. Mom. Dad. I wanted to tell you something. Not now, but when things clear up. But since the subject is on the table... There's someone pregnant in the house and it's me. I'm pregnant. Congratulations. That's why Felipe is here. - No, Mom. - Now I understand. That means you broke up with Javier - and you're back with Felipe. - No, Mom. - I knew it. I knew it! - No, Mom. I always said you were getting back. Mom, Felipe is not the dad. They're perfect for each other. I don't know yet. That's the problem. How can you not know? Let me explain, Dad. The night I got pregnant... Okay? That night I... Well, how do I put it? That night I slept... ...with Javier and with Felipe. A little louder, I can't hear you, sweetie. MarÃ­a, Cristina is trying to tell us that she had sexual intercourse with both of them. With her boyfriend and her ex on the same day. - Is that possible? - Thank you for that. We won't know who the father is until the fourth month, so we have to wait. When you thought you have heard everything. And what about some dessert? Dessert would be nice, right? What's important now is that we're all together as a family and that's a huge excuse to celebrate. - Cheers. - Sure, to family. Pedrito. I'm getting some more water. Mother-in-law, do you want anything? No. Thanks, son. Javi. Since you're standing, could you do me a favor? In my tent there's a dessert I prepared this morning. Could you bring that while I tell them how I learned the recipe? Of course. I'll bring it. - Thank you. - Thank you, Javier. You can't imagine the dessert I have for you. - Yes? - It's an Indian dessert. Yes. Okay, stay here. Stay. Okay? You're going to leave me alone, okay? Okay. Fetch! Fetch! Fetch! Fetch! Fetch! He couldn't stop. How far along are you, sweetie? - Dad... - Felipe. Hey, your dog ran outside after a car. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry, I couldn't catch him because I had the dessert in my hands. - What do we do now? - We go looking for it. No, no, relax. It's okay. Chupi has a GPS in his collar so we can track him down. Let's see. See? There he is. He's nearby, three blocks away. It's delicious. Behind the house in front, passing the park. - There he is. - Oh, but look. He's going that way. Yes... That's weird. Why aren't you moving, Chupi? Chupi. Chupi? Sir. I'm sorry, sir. I'm really sorry. - My Chupi! - Damn. Who was the idiot who left the door open and let this poor animal outside? Mother-in-law, my Chupi. I miss my Chupi. - Let me see his face. - No. I want to see his little eyebrows. Chupi. I HAVE AN EMERGENCY!!! I HAVE AN EMERGENCY!!! - What? - I don't know. - I got a message from Cristina. - Me too. - The baby! - The baby! - What happened? - Is it the baby? - Contractions? - Did your water break? - Get the car! - Calm down. This is an emergency. A culinary one. I'm craving a lemon pie of those that are acid and sweet at the same time and I can't sleep. Is this a joke? No. I'm sorry, guys. I'm sorry, it was wrong. - Go to sleep. - No. - Don't say that. - I didn't mean that. We're here at your disposal right there. No, I really feel bad. I know this is because of my pregnancy, but you can't imagine what I feel. I can almost taste the pie in my mouth, and I don't know how to control it. I need it. Cristina, that's a unique experience. Cravings are the way your body has to tell you what you need. Javier and I are here to help you. - Don't worry, I'll get you one. - Thank you. I don't know where from, but I'll do anything for you and the baby. - I'll be back, okay? - Thank you. - We're closed. - No, please! Don't close! Do you need something? Huh? I have everything. - This is all I was able to... - All good? Yes. Yes, all good. You have to try this, it's delicious. Where did he get that at this time? He didn't get it, he made it. Oh, that's right. Of course, he made desserts, the damned bastard. - What was that? - Nothing. That it looks just like the one you make. Not only looks like it, but it also tastes like it too. - Incredible. - Is that right? Felipe. Don't tell me my mom gave you the secret ingredient. Your mom is very generous. We went out for a cup of coffee, and she shared the recipe with me. - That old hag. - What did you say? That I'd like to learn how to make desserts. It's okay, I'd be glad to teach you, Javi. It would be great. This recipe is a family treasure. You need to taste it yourself. I'm not feeling like it right now. You have to taste it, it's amazing. You'll like it. It's so good. I told you. I told him. THREE MONTHS LATER Let's see. This can't be so hard. - What are you doing? - Huh? Nothing. Please, don't touch anything. Okay? Okay, I'm sorry. Hey, can I ask you a question? Sure. Tell me. Why are you doing all this? Why did you get into this? To be honest, I think I never forgot about Cristina. We were together in fifth grade and junior year at college, but it never ended, you know? What I mean is... ...in my head it never ended. I've always had the bad habit of comparing my girlfriends with her and now that I think about it, Cristina was, and will be the best thing that ever happened in my life. I know what happened that night was a mistake and I'm truly sorry. - It wasn't planned. - I know it wasn't. I know neither of you knew you would meet, but it still happened. It's hard to take in. I know. But there's nothing I can do about it. And I don't want to lie to you, the idea of becoming a father excites me. I think you don't really know what having a real relationship means, because you've spent your whole life traveling. But living with someone, sharing your life, that's not so easy. You have to understand each other, you have to respect their customs, their habits... their whims. It means waking up every single day next to the same person and knowing you weren't wrong by choosing her. Hi. Weird, you two are not trying to kill each other. We were... ...reconnecting our energies. Yes, we were aligning our "chankros." - Chakras. - Chakras. It was a joke. That's good. I was thinking about going to buy a crib. I know it's too soon, but I want to do this with time. Want to come with me? I was just checking some stores that we could visit, - Should we go? - Yes, let's go. I don't want to interrupt, but don't you think it would be better to make the crib ourselves? - Ourselves? - BabatumbÃ© is a carpenter I met in Mozambique. He taught me this art. I don't intend to be arrogant, but this crib could resist an atomic bomb. An atomic bomb? - It's just a saying. - I think it's good, Javi. Cristina, our baby will sleep in here. Well, the child. Okay? I just want to make sure that it's sturdy. It's okay, Cristina. Let him, he has the right to. - Go ahead, test it. - Okay. - Slowly. - That's it. Put more pressure on it. Feel it, it's solid. Yes, I have to test that it's not going to break. It's fine. He's a committed father, he needs to follow his instincts. Cristina, we have to check if BabatumbÃ© is a good teacher. Let me give it one last check. I think the mobile should be here. I thought about a mobile for the child when he's lying down looking at them. - Javi, stop! - No, Javi! - Are you okay? - Calm down. - Don't move. - Breathe. Breathe and let the oxygen flow right through you... Felipe! An ambulance! Don't move. Yes, it's sturdy. It's good. Don't move, okay? We're going to call an ambulance. Are you okay? Om Shanti! No! Felipe, an ambulance! Calm down. Calm down. Could you forgive me? You're safe by a miracle. - You almost broke your neck. - I know. All because... I wanted to... Why didn't you stay together? - What are you talking about? - About you and Felipe. He's successful, handsome, charming, he has traveled around the world. And he has abs like Wolverine. He loves puppies, he's a good cook, and he's always happy. He's perfect and... ...he obviously makes you happy. What's important is that I met someone incredible. Someone who really knows me. Who has been there for me in good times, in bad times, and in awful times. Someone willing to do anything just to make me happy. Even forgive. Because he has an amazing heart. Who cares what happened with Felipe? I met you. The most wonderful and loyal man in the world. I hate you. You're making me cry. Help me wipe my tears. I made you this. Would you marry me? Or not anymore? It's what I want the most in the world. - It fits. - Yes. - Like a princess. - Like a princess. - I'm sorry, you're in pain. - No, keep going. Keep going, it doesn't matter. Om Shanti. La, la, la Wow. What did I miss? I feel a powerful energy in this room. She asked me to marry her. - Really? - Yes. Wow! What incredible news. - Great, Javi! - Watch out. - Thank you. - I'm sorry. Now it's time to start fixing things. These have been some tough times. That's in the past, now it's time to think about the future. - Be careful. - I'm sorry. No, don't worry. I'm never getting better. Don't worry, if you don't, I can always marry Felipe. - Just kidding. Just kidding. - My phone's ringing. Hand it to me. - Where is it? - It's here. Thank you. Who is this? It's the office. - Hello? - Hello, Javi. - Are you sitting? - Yes. Your housing project has been approved as a cultural donation. Okay. You have to come right now and give a presentation. Okay, thank you. What happened? The firm decided to go with my self-sufficient houses under cultural donation, that way they save some tax money. That means my project is approved and my dreams are coming true. - That's amazing! - Great news! - I'm sorry. - No, no, no. It's okay. Now I need to find a way to bring the model. - Pass me the laptop, please. - Sure. The shareholders want me to give them a presentation, but I don't know how. Javi, if you want, I can help you with it. You obviously can't do it in this state. Would you... Would you really do that for me, Felipe? Of course. You're in good hands. Boss, it was hard to get the info from the card, but here's the video we got. I don't know if you'll like it. Gentlemen, Om shanti, shanti, shanti. Namaste. I'm here on behalf of Javier. Sadly, he had a small accident that prevented him from being here and he's truly sorry because he really wanted to show you this project that he has put so much effort in. - How are you feeling today? - Good. I'd say I'm almost 90% recovered. No, no. I'd say 70%, 75%. - Calm down. - Yes. - Hi, Javi. - Hey. - How did it go? - They loved the presentation. That's good. Did you close the deal? Not only did we close, but with your bosses, we made a little surprise for you. Enjoy. He sent me to present this beautiful model with these tiny houses. He's really glad about the results and also sent me to tell you that you're a bunch of incompetent assholes without creativity, who spent the entire day sitting around while others do your job. Is this some kind of joke? Who the hell are you? What are you doing here? Get out. The best is yet to come. I don't want to see anything else. Javier didn't finish it, but he sent me to give you this interesting surprise. - Look! - What are you doing? This is a millenary technique called making fire. - Do you know it? - What are you doing? This way people will be warm in the winter. Fire! This is for Chupacabra, son of a bitch. Please, calm down, sir. Sir? What have you done, idiot? I'm sorry. How could you do that? Are you crazy? I'm going to kill you like you killed my project! I'm a being of light! - I don't care. - And you're filled with evil! - You killed my dog! Dog killer! - I'm going to kill you. What are you two idiots doing? Could you stop? Cristina is waiting for you. The results are here. Shit. - What happened? - Who's the father? Both of you. What do you mean by that, doctor? That's impossible. No, it's not impossible. Let me explain, Cristina is having twins. - What? - What? Twins? That's right. Twins. What happened is called Heteroparental Superfecundation. That's the process when a woman ovulates twice in the same month around the same days, and these ovules are fertilized by different sperms. In this case, both of your sperm, gentlemen. Which means you're both the fathers of those twins. The only way of knowing who's the father of each kid will be after they're born, but technically, you're both the fathers. Is that clear? No. Yes. And you have to take care of yourself. This isn't a regular pregnancy. You have to take some precautions. It's nothing to be worried, about but take it easy. No, doctor. Please, tell me this is a joke. No. It's not a joke. It's science. Change that face. He didn't say anything bad. It's life and life is a gift. You have two beings of light within you, we have to celebrate. Stop it, Felipe. There's nothing to celebrate. This has been a mistake from the beginning. What happened between us and that kind of living together, which I don't think was a good idea. And now I don't know what's going to happen. Son of a bitch. I'm sorry, I just wanted to cheer you up. Not now. - I forgot my bag. - I'll get it for you. I'll go, thank you. I need to think. You screwed my life! Terrorist! Did you want to run me over? Are you crazy? What did you say? Crazy? You're crazy thinking we can be a family! - Come here! - Let me go. - Let me go. I hate you! - I hate you too! Everyone has their limit, and this glasses are mine! What's that? Help! Help! - Wait, Cristina. - Please, Cristina. Enough with that. You don't care about anything other than yourselves. You've never cared about me or my pregnancy. All this time has been a competition between men to see who's best. You're self-centered and immature. I know I got you into this mess, but that's enough. Now that I know I'm having twins, I want to be relaxed. I want to go through this in peace. And alone. Javier, I'm truly disappointed with you. I don't recognize you. And you, Felipe. What happened? Weren't you supposed to be a being of peace? Like some kind of yogi? What are you doing? You left me because you wanted to see the world, and now that you did it, you think you can come back and get into my life as if nothing happened? No. You're wrong. Both of you are. You're both wrong. EMERGENCY FIVE MONTHS LATER I'm so excited! What do you think they are? - One of each. - Two girls. Can we know their gender? Yes. They're hiding, so let's give it a little. They kicked me. - Let me see! Let me see! - Yes! How cute! Kick! Kick! They're going to be here soon. Do you like your drawing? - Yes, auntie. - It's for the both of you. Thank you, auntie Catalina. And now the other one. - No, no, not me. - Yes, yes, yes. No, no, no. Now, it's time for Sol to kick! - Did Sol kick? - No. These are exclusive clothes with the house specialty, strawberry and vanilla muffins. Never seen before! Never. How are you? I'm fine. How are you? Fine. I'm really sad not being with you this last time. I know. Me too. Javier, I don't know what's going to happen, but I want you to know that I want you to be a part of my life. Cristina... And if you say yes, and want to, we're going to put a lot of effort into making this work. And we're going to have to forgive and understand that this family is not only the two of us and our child. See you in a week, right? Right? Of course. Of course, next week. And this would be what I've been working on for some time. Interesting. I like it. It's risky and creative. It seems this isn't just a job for you. It's... - It's my passion. - I can tell. You know what? You have that magic touch that could make our buildings more modern, functional, practical, but with the style and elegance of the classic. - Really? - Sure. Of course. If you want, we would love to listen to your proposals about sustainable energy. In fact, if you want, as we speak, you could become a member of our firm. - Right now? - Uh-huh. - Right now as in now-now? - Yes, what do you say? - Would you give me a minute? - Of course. - Cata? - Javier, you're going to be a father! Run because Cris is going into the delivery room right now! - Now? - Yes! She asked me to tell you. Sure, I'll be on my way. - Hurry up. - Thank you, Cata. - Uh... - Yes? - I'm sorry. I'll take it. - That's good. I'll take it. - Welcome to our company. - Thank you. Just tell me when I can start. Now, excuse me, but I have to go. I just got a call telling me my baby's going to be born. - Congratulations. - Thank you. - Well, it's babies. - Twins? - No, it's our babies. - What? No, not ours. How could one be yours? It's mine and... It doesn't matter, I'll tell you later. Thank you! Felipe. Felipe! Felipe! Javi. It's so nice to see you. Are they born? - They're born. - Congratulations. - Congratulations to you too. - Thank you. - You're a father. - Yes. - And you too. - We both are. We're fathers. Friends? Of course, friends. - Should we go? - Let's go. In how long until we can see the babies? In ten minutes. - How long has it been? - 12 seconds? Thank you. What a wonderful thing. They're two beautiful babies. Yes. You're the fathers of two baby girls. The best is yet to come. They're so beautiful. Hi, sweetie. Hi. Hi, gorgeous. - Sweetie. - You're going to make me cry. You're so pretty. And Cristina? She should be going back to her room. Doctor, can we see Cristina? Javier, Felipe, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but Cristina didn't survive the childbirth. What? We knew it would be hard. She knew it too. We gave her options. We could save only one of the girls, but she put her foot down and ordered us to save both girls. We did all we could, but we didn't make it. What? No. No. No, this can't be true. Please, doctor, do something. Cristina can't be dead. I'm sorry, Javier. - What? - I'm really sorry. No. No. Would you marry me? - All of this is for you. - Look at my boyfriend! That's amazing! Such good news! Eyes Wide Shut! Pan's Labyrinth! Tarzan! Do you like your drawing? Yes, auntie. Thank you, auntie Catalina. THREE MONTHS LATER How are you? Hanging on. I dream of coming here and she's inside taking orders from clients. But when I talk to her, she doesn't answer. I call and call, but she doesn't see me. And suddenly, I'm awake. I understand. All what's left... is to let go little by little. To let go and accept it. The lawyer called. He told me we could go to take the tests tomorrow to see who's the father of each baby. Do you want some? - Sure. - It's good. Hey, do we really want to divide the family even more? You and I are terrible fathers, that's obvious. But maybe... Maybe if we're together, an architect and a free-spirit businessman, maybe we can make a beautiful family. Who cares who's the father of who? To me, they're both my daughters... ...and I think it's the same for you. You're right. They're our daughters. Yes, let's do this right. Let's be the best family for them. Come on. Now we're like a gay couple. Hey, gay is trending. We're going to be two very cool dads. There's no gay couple without a dog. You're completely right. - Hi. - Hi, what's your name? What's your name? So pretty. So pretty. Sign above your name, please. Okay, gentlemen. You officially have the responsibility of Sol and Luna. Congratulations. Congratulations. Gay couples always make me cry. No, no. - We're not... - Don't worry. - I'm not worried. - You look great. - But we're not... - Javi. We look great. Congratulations. I love you, guys. You're the most beautiful family I know. We are the most beautiful family, Cata. You're a part of it too. Don't make me cry because I just put my contacts on. - Let's go to the daddies. - If it's not a problem, sir. Sure, no problem. I want a copy. Come with your dad. Some cupcakes for the grandparents. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Did you make these? - Of course I did. Don't feed it to the dog. - Would you like a cupcake? - No, thank you. Hi, everyone. - Take one and share. - Thank you. Hi, you look like you want one. For you and your family. Such a pretty table I laid! Just beautiful. - Guys. - Happy birthday, baby. Have some cupcakes. - Thank you, Cata. - Enjoy it. It's tasty. Yes. But Cristina made them better. Daddy. - Did she say daddy? - She said daddy. - She called me daddy. - She called us. - She called me daddy. - She said daddy! Hey! Sweetie! Who said daddy? Who said daddy? Who said daddy? Who said daddy? Who said daddy? Who said daddy?
