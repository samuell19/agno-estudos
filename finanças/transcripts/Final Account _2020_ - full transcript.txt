Monsters exist, but they are too few in number to be truly dangerous. More dangerous are the common men, the functionaries ready to believe and to act without asking questions. Primo Levi - Auschwitz Survivor Sharpen the long knives Sharpen the long knives Sharpen the long knives On the paving stone So that they go better So that they go better So that they go better Into the Jewish belly As boys we thought nothing of singing these songs. Isn't that terrible? I once flew over Buchenwald with my squadron. We flew low intentionally so we could see into the camp. We asked ourselves, "What is happening in Buchenwald?" TO EACH WHAT HE DESERVES And we heard things that you could scarcely believe. I was on leave with my brother-in-law. He told me he had witnessed Germans from various units shooting Jews in huge pits and burying them. He showed us the photos. I said, "Can this be Germany?" Perpetrators are not born, they are made. In 2008, filmmaker Luke Holland embarked on a journey to find and interview witnesses to the crimes of the Third Reich. This is a provincial bedroom community. This place makes me feel really aggressive. I don't know why. -How is your father? -He's well. He's better than I am. "Nazi Party Census." Here it says "Blood Order." -Blood Order. -Or is it crossed out? -What is a Blood Order? -I don't know. "I was made an SS storm trooper on January 30, 1936. On January 10, 1940, I was dispatched to the SS officers school in Dachau. I passed with fairly good results. Promoted to SS sergeant major on March 1, 1940." It sounds rather brutal. -Are you seeing this for the first time? -Yes, I didn't know any of this. I didn't even know he'd been posted to Dachau. We were raised in this manner: "Children may only speak when spoken to. They are not allowed to ask questions." KARL HOLLANDER QUAKENBRÜCK, GERMANY 1914 SS LEIBSTANDARTE ADOLF HITLER, OBERSTURMFÜHRER What is a Blood Order? -Bloodbath? -Blood Order. It was a political decoration for participating in the 1923 Munich Uprising. -Did you take part in that? -No. You would have been only nine. And when were you sworn in at the Feldherrnhalle? 1935. The bells rang all over Germany. It's hard to imagine that, after Hitler's seizure of power, the bells rang everywhere in Germany. My mother voted for Hitler. My father also voted for Hitler in 1932. Unemployment and inflation. OTTO DUSCHELEIT INSTERBURG, GERMANY 1925 - WAFFEN-SS My older brother was already a convinced Nazi in 1932. In 1932, he was 11 years old. I remember how he showed me his brass knuckles with spikes. He said, "Today we're going to smash the communist HQ." GERMANS - DON'T BUY FROM JEWS And he photographed Insterburg citizens who frequented Jewish shops. And then these pictures were exhibited at the Insterburg Town Hall. Pictures of people buying from Jewish shops. HANS WERK BERLIN, GERMANY 1927 - WAFFEN-SS At age six in 1933, I attended the local primary school. The teacher was a local party operative. He raised us according to the Nazi doctrine. In the morning, we had to stand up: "Heil Hitler." He practically raised me to be a Nazi. Against my parents' wishes. I trusted the teacher more than them. Our teacher asserted strong control over us. This is my Hitler Youth membership card. I joined the Jungvolk at the age of ten and received this. I joined on May 1, 1937. Even before I was ten years old. I couldn't wait. MARIANNE CHANTELAU WILHELMSHAVEN, GERMANY 1924 BUND DEUTSCHER MÄDEL When you're ten, 12 years old, what do you want? You want to be in a group. You want to get out of the house. We could do sports. We were allowed to play tennis on the marine sports field. We were allowed to use the pool. We were allowed to play on the lawn in the park. Everything had been forbidden before. KLAUS KLEINAU BERNBURG, GERMANY 1927 - WAFFEN-SS My mother was active in the Frauenschaft. That was the women's organization. When we went for walks on Sunday, when I was little, my father always put on his uniform. And then we went for a walk. My mother didn't like this at all. Women didn't have a uniform, but he made sure that she wore the Frauenschaft badge on her coat so that everyone could see that they supported the Nazi ideology. KARL-HEINZ LIPOK - BRANDENBURG, GERMANY 1921 - SS DEATH'S HEAD UNIT I would have liked to have gotten involved. But Father said no. And in the summer of 1933, they finally said yes. And I got a brown shirt and black trousers for my birthday. And that was in Stendal, when we visited my grandparents. And they bought the uniform from a Jewish store. We did things that we enjoyed. But that faded. And when we moved to the Hitler Youth at the age of 14 participation was mandatory. I was in a communications unit, where we trained as radio operators at the age of only 15 and 16. And my leader was drafted into the military, and then suddenly I was a Hitler Youth leader. They found me a bit girlish. I wasn't the right kind of leader for the Hitler Youth. Boxing in the afternoon. We weren't allowed to stop until blood flowed. At the end of the week, the leader spoke to me. "You don't have what it takes to be a Hitler Youth leader. You're too soft." From the ages of ten to 14 there was the Jungvolk organization. At 14 you joined the Hitler Youth. For the girls, there was the Jungmädel and then the BDM. The Association of German Girls. Blue skirt, white blouse, and the knot, made of leather. It was a triangular neckerchief, held together with the knot. There were these social evenings, where we would meet. Those were evenings where we spoke about Nazism, about the Führer Sometimes Hitler's Mein Kampf. Parts of that. We didn't support the party. But we liked the uniform. We went along with it because we enjoyed it. Putting on the uniform and going on marches or singing and so on. Oh, that was lovely! They were hiking songs. The ones you still sing today. It was lovely. Raise the flag The ranks tightly closed The SA marches With calm, steady step Comrades shot By the Red Front and reactionaries March in spirit within our ranks JEWS ARE NOT WELCOME HERE JEWS ARE UNWELCOME HERE JEWS ARE NOT WELCOME IN OUR GERMAN FORESTS We had the task of standing guard in front of a Jewish department store. And we little boys-- I was just nine-- had to line up in front of this Jewish shop and had to link arms and were not allowed to let anyone through. My friend said, "Let's go in there. There's got to be something there. I think you can recognize the Jew by The Jew smells. You can smell the Jew." Between Slawentzitz and Ujest there was a Jewish cemetery. There were at least 100 graves or more. HUGO GOTE SLAWENTZITZ, GERMANY 1923 - WEHRMACHT So there must have been a Jewish community. At some point. We were in the Jungvolk and Hitler Youth. And that's when the Jew-baiting started. As we repeatedly went to the Jewish cemetery. We went at midnight, for the witching hour. It was a test of courage. The Jews weren't popular, were they? And this had consequences. HEINRICH SCHULZE CELLE, GERMANY 1927 - WEHRMACHT Why weren't the Jews popular? Apparently because they They were into deal-making. They had hooked noses. We learned to read with the normal alphabet book. But we also had a Jew-themed alphabet book. It was published by Streicher, who had also published the Nuremberg race laws. And it had a caricature of a Jew for each letter. I remember one in particular. A butcher's shop that was really greasy and filthy. A disgusting Jew with dirty long hair and a hat, behind the counter. Next to him, a blonde German girl with a white apron. He had his hand where it shouldn't be. The Jews were to blame for everything. We were a village of 175 people. No electricity. The mobile Nazi film unit came to show films. Jud Süss. They showed Nazi films in the smallest villages. You can't imagine today what kind of pressure there was. That was my grandmother. -Is that the Jewish grandmother? -Yes. That is the Jewish generation. That's her. And that's her mother. Yes. My older brother was a convinced Nazi. And much later, he realized that our father was also a Jew, according to Jewish tradition. His mother was Jewish. But he didn't make that public. He kept that a secret. And when my brother realized our father was a Jew He wanted to be racially pure. When he realized that, according to both Jewish and Nazi rules, our father was actually Jewish, a process of rethinking began. There were no Jews in our village. My parents had contact with a Jew who came from Friedeberg-Ostbahnhof. He bought the skins that we sold him on slaughtering days. I always went to Woldenberg with him to get my hair cut. His name was Piefke. One day he didn't turn up. I asked, "Where is Piefke?" They told me he emigrated. Bernburg, Germany Originally it was a perfectly normal hospital for psychiatric patients. HEINZ HENNIG BERNBURG, GERMANY 1923 - WEHRMACHT And it remained one, but the fascists turned a part of it into an extermination center. It was all kept very secret. But word got around that buses were arriving in Bernburg with darkened windows in the direction of the sanatorium, as Bernburgers called it. Every few days, black smoke rose, and it smelled sweet. From this, many people concluded that people were burned there. People arrived and were murdered. The furnaces are still there today. It was talked about a little. Very quietly. It was dangerous to talk about it. It was only whispered about in private. Bernburg was one of six euthanasia centers in Germany and Austria. Approximately 14,000 individuals, regarded by the Nazis as "not worthy of life," were murdered here. HERBERT FUCHS BREGENZ, AUSTRIA 1919 WAFFEN-SS, OBERSTURMFÜHRER It was November 9th. 1938. The SS was sworn in on that date every year. The SS from all over Germany congregated in front of the Feldherrnhalle. It was night, and we marched there in ranks. And then came Hitler, Himmler and so on To the left, above the Residenz, next to the Feldherrnhalle, there was the glow of a fire. It didn't mean anything. Just a fire somewhere. We returned to the barracks. The next day we found out. Kristallnacht. I had no idea. That fire was the synagogue. The party ordered the schools to take the children there. The children should see it. What was the motive? They did not belong to our ethnic group. Apparently. I don't know the motives. Can you remember your reaction? Firstly, I was too young then. Fourteen? But look, it wasn't in our neighborhood. And honestly, we didn't really leave our neighborhood. -Hello, Karl. -Hi, Gisela. From 1829 until its destruction on November 10, 1938, this was the center of the Jewish community in Weener. Synagogue from 1829 to 1938. A school from 1853. Rabbi and teacher's house from 1887. I can't read the Jewish. So there was a Jewish community here? Yes. In Weener. Who burned all of this down? People from the SA. KARL-HEINZ RINNE BERLIN, GERMANY 1922 - WEHRMACHT We were on Fasanenstrasse and saw the synagogue ablaze. And the fire brigade stood in front of it. They did nothing. Nothing at all. We were astonished that they didn't intervene. They just let it burn down. I only understood it all later. They only made sure the neighboring houses would not catch fire. But that was only the beginning of the hounding of the Jews. I didn't really care that the synagogue was burned down. I wasn't sorry about that. I didn't feel any pity for the Jews. So for you, it wasn't a crime? No, not for me Well, hold on! Crime One would almost have to say yes. However, I didn't consider it as one. It was all the same to me. But if you look at it from a legal perspective, one would have to consider it a crime, because it is the destruction of other people's property. And so the one who destroys it is a criminal. But I didn't feel that way. Kristallnacht 9-10 November 1938 Some 1400 synagogues and places of worship were destroyed. Over 7,000 Jewish properties and cemeteries were damaged. Many Jews were murdered. 30,000 were imprisoned. The event caused a major Jewish exodus. We didn't have any civilian clothes. We were always in uniform from morning till evening. And when you are in uniform the whole year round, that leaves a mark. You have no time to orient yourself as a civilian. NAPOLA Nazi Political Academy In the Nazi political academy, it was important that graduates should enter into all the professions. There should be people everywhere who played an elite role in Nazism. Everyone hoped to be drafted as early as possible to become a soldier and go to war. Many of us volunteered for the Waffen-SS. So just as this was an elite, we wanted to continue being part of the elite. The family tree. SS Lieutenant Karl Heinrich Lübbert Hollander. Believer. With the swastika, see? This shows you are Aryan? Of good stock. Yes. You couldn't become an officer in the SS otherwise? No. That was a prerequisite. What was your rank? SS-Obersturmführer, first lieutenant in the end. I went to the SS because I heard they trained you hard. I was an athlete. Athletics, wrestling, boxing, football, hiking, skiing. I liked sports. I liked it tough. On March 15th, I signed up for the SS. The SS was the elite corps. They had the best tanks. And we got excited. Well, I did anyway. My father wasn't excited about it. I did it without his knowledge. I believed in it and wanted to die a hero's death. I had written my farewell letter to my parents. "When I fall, you should be proud. You should not wear black" Nonsense like that. Today, you wonder how that could happen. My parents took me to a career counselor. The man said, "First, he must complete his labor and military service. That's two and a half years. Or you could send him to Oranienburg. To the Death's Head Unit. They'll take him at 16. And then he won't have to do any labor service." WORK SETS YOU FREE Sachsenhausen Concentration Camp, Oranienburg Established by the SS, 1936 Once, I saw a man there. I said, "I know him." He once bought stamps from me for charity. And I wanted to go over. He hadn't done anything! My comrade held me back and said, "You idiot! Haven't you noticed what's going on?" That was a Mr. Warschauer. But why did they send him to Sachsenhausen? I can't tell you that. Being a Jew was probably enough. Yes. Locking the man up was a disgrace. We did not agree with that. You can imagine. But when you're caught up in it you keep your mouth shut. At 16. I'm sorry. But that's the truth. And then I heard screams outside. I put the table under the window and then a stool on top, so I could look through the window. And then I saw it. How people were beaten. With bullwhips. And others hanging, their hands tied behind their backs. The stool was pulled from under their feet and they screamed until they were unconscious. If an officer asked you to do it? If an officer had asked me to pull the stool away, the stool would have gone flying. No doubt about it. 200,000 prisoners were held in Sachsenhausen. Tens of thousands were murdered by shooting, gassing and medical experiments. On January 10, 1940, I was ordered to attend the SS officers training school in Dachau. I passed the exam with fairly good results. The school was next to the concentration camp. My question would be whether you knew that Jews were interned in Dachau. No. We didn't know that. -You didn't know that? -For us, they were political prisoners. KURT SAMETREITER - GASTEIN VALLEY, AUSTRIA 1922 - WAFFEN-SS, OBERSCHARFÜHRER If someone says they didn't know about concentration camps, it's just not true. The concentration camp inmates went to work in their prison uniforms. With two or three guards, depending on how many prisoners. Everybody saw this. I was stationed at Dachau on April 1, 1938. There were also Jews there. I know this because our local police commander was there. He was also a Jew. And he was taken there. I even saw him. -In the camp. -In Dachau? Well, yes. On his way to work. Dachau Concentration Camp, Germany The first of a network of concentration camps under SS control, where millions, mostly Jews, were murdered. When Adolf Hitler came to power, all those who opposed him were arrested overnight, put into concentration camps, killed The intellectual leadership of the resistance was gone. And anyone who still protested was promptly killed. Killed. And so people were scared. I can't explain it any other way. These heroes you expect to find-- there aren't many of them. Mauthausen Concentration Camp, Austria Established by the SS, 1938 MARGARETE SCHWARZ MELK, AUSTRIA 1925 - CIVILIAN I was 14 years old. I was the nanny for an SS family for six years. I looked after the children because their mother worked in the concentration camp. We took the children sometimes, when they wanted to see their mother. She never came home. She normally slept over there. She worked nights in the canteen. I also went to the cinema in the camp. The prisoners filled my teeth. They sorted out my teeth. So you had your dentist there? Yes, prisoners were the dentists. -Prisoners were the dentists. -Yeah, he fixed my teeth. They were very nice prisoners. The Kapos and so on. They were nice. Only the poor Jews were killed straightaway. When they arrived, they were immediately taken to the gas chamber. They burned them immediately. They killed so many people. In Mauthausen, there were the "death stairs." In order to avoid a detour Because the camp was at the top of the hill and the quarry was at the bottom. To make it quicker, they built the "death stairs." The steps were different heights, and when it rained, there were those who slipped and fell or dropped the stone and injured somebody else's foot. Many lost their lives. There were many accidents. Did you see that too back then? Yes. FRANZ SPALEK MÜHLVIERTELREGION, AUSTRIA 1925 APPRENTICE STONEMASON And then there was another steep wall, and some were pushed down, either by Kapos or by the SS, over the steep slope. Twenty meters in free-fall onto stones. Nobody survived that. Mauthausen was at the center of a network of camps providing laborers to German and Austrian industry. Of the 190,000 prisoners, nearly half were murdered. U-Boat Bunker Valentin Bremen, Germany These are tomatoes. I don't have anything green. But I don't think that matters. Smell this. Is it local? Homemade. Yesterday. That was taken for my ID card for the bunker site. I was a wages clerk. I did the payroll for the German workers. For the foreign workers, I only submitted their hours, because the concentration camp prisoners didn't get paid. There were groups of laborers in Kap Horn and here at the Valentin Bunker, where they built submarines. Kap Horn was surrounded by water on three sides. On one side were pontoons, boats, that the concentration camp inmates were herded onto and then taken to the steel works. We Germans were not supposed to go there. But I went once. And I saw how these people stood, packed in tightly like matches, on the boat. I am ashamed to this day that humans could do this to other humans. The Kapo came from a sub-camp of Neuengamme concentration camp. And he had a group of 15 or 20 men, and these 15 or 20 had to be brought back to the concentration camp, dead or alive. They dragged them along. Just so he could hand over the same number of men. You mean, at the end of the shift, the same number had to be brought back, even if they were dead? Yes. When they could barely walk. -How do you know that? -I saw it. Our hut was just 20 meters from the bunker. But as a bookkeeper, I had nothing to do with it. Bergen-Belsen Concentration Camp, Germany Established by the SS in 1943 They were unloaded from the trains and then they had to walk five or six kilometers to the camp. When they walked past in their wooden clogs, it sounded like a threshing machine. "Here they come again," we'd say to one another. Most people benefited from it. They could work here and earn money. And those who earned money here were okay with it. They made a profit out of it, you mean? You could find advantages in it, yes. -They benefited? -Yes. Yes. In some way, the concentration camp had an effect on all of us. Local shops benefited too, of course. The butcher shops, the bakeries and all the grocers. -Your grandfather was a delivery man? -Yes, he was a delivery driver. With a cart and horses. He collected goods from the train station in Bergen and took them to the camp. The prisoners, were they hiding here somewhere? Yes, they hid in the hayloft at night or in the pigsty. Or on top of the pigsty. I mean, they are big buildings. Either we discovered them in the morning or they came to us. Well, they were hungry. Well And then what happened to them? Well, they were picked up. Here in the barracks, they were a bit, what do I know Or to the concentration camp. They took them to the camp. And who picked them up? Yes, guards, you know. But how did the guards know that people were hiding here? Well, we discovered them and reported it. At least that is what I remember. Did you make a phone call, or how did you Yes, yes, yes. Do you know what happened to these prisoners? No, nobody knows that. Slawentzitz Forty-four kilometers from Auschwitz My father was a railway man. My father was also head of the cargo department. This is why our apartment was right in the train station. It was interesting, because when the trains came, we could clearly see what was happening. What were his duties? Well, to register these trains. Let's say a freight train loaded with people and headed for Auschwitz. It had to be registered on the paperwork at the freight yard where all the trains went. Slawentzitz was one of many sites, which included concentration camps and factories, that formed part of the Auschwitz industrial complex. The Nazi policy of extermination through labor claimed hundreds of thousands of lives. They cut down all the trees for about ten kilometers and they put up the factories there in no time. Massive camps of prisoners and Jews and so on. They were unloaded at the freight yard and were marched to their respective camps. Every day, I saw guards escorting Jews from work back to the camp. Sometimes they had to carry one of their fellows because they could not walk anymore. They put them on some kind of stretcher. I saw that often. My father knew where people were going. No one came back. They must have gone somewhere. Sometimes my father came home and said, "They dispatched Jews again today." To Auschwitz. People said quietly, "They are driven up the chimney there." I still have the smell of the crematorium in my nose. When you saw the smoke going up, like when you burn car tires, then we said, "They have put some more in." At least three people were put on there at a time, on a metal grille. As the skin burned, it produced a lot of smoke. You could smell it two kilometers away. Grunewald station includes a memorial to the 50,000 Jews deported to Auschwitz and other concentration camps. Their departure was witnessed by Berlin's residents. Ebensee, Austria The site of a concentration camp, established in 1943, where 30,000 individuals were imprisoned. Almost 9000 were worked to death. Are you all from Ebensee? Yes, we were all born in Ebensee. -All of you? -Yes. All of us. What did you know about the concentration camp during the war? How much did you know? We knew nothing! At least I didn't. I can't speak for the others. I knew nothing. Everything about the camps was covered up. You understand? It was all hushed up. Suppressed. People would talk quietly, but not out loud! Well, it was awful. It was awful. My old neighbor-- he moved to Poland. He told me so much, because he was in the concentration camp and survived. -He survived. -They were hungry. So many of them starved to death. The camp inmates worked in the tunnels? Those who still could. Often they had to carry them back on stretchers, when they couldn't take any more. No food. They were finished. Yes, but so many. What happened to those who could no longer work? -They were burned. -Yes, exactly. Every time. The ovens were fired up. You could see the smoke from the ovens. You knew what was going on. Those were horrific times. And they beat them to the end. In the labor camps, they beat them to the end. Then it was over. So you think that the people here knew what was going on? Quietly. No one would admit it out of fear of being brought there as well. People said, "Don't say anything or you'll end up in the camp too." They noticed. Everyone knew, but no one said anything! The day before the Americans came, there was a lot of smoke, and it smelled awful. They burned them all. The ones who were worn out. They burned them all. I remember that. I always sat by the window, so I saw a lot. The Jeep drove up. -The Americans. -Yes. They opened the gate. Imagine the rejoicing when they came! -How they screamed! -How they screamed! But for joy! They were cries of joy. They were so glad. The townspeople got scared, thinking they would break into the houses or something. But this didn't happen! And suddenly, all the SS guards were gone. None to be seen, from one moment to the next. They would ring your doorbell late at night, and your whole apartment was searched. But someone was there? -Your friend? -Yes, my boyfriend. Well, he was with the SS. They would have caught him. -But he was not from Ebensee. -No, he was not from Ebensee. I see. Your husband, was he a Nazi? No. Your husband was an SS camp guard? If I hadn't hidden him for nine months, they would have arrested him. But they didn't get him. For the German people, the Waffen-SS were at the peak of the nation. HERMAN KNOTH HAMBURG, GERMANY 1927 - WAFFEN-SS Not just physically, spiritually too. Yes, an elite. Yes, it's still there. Whenever I have surgery, I tell them about it. I've had quite a few operations. It's somewhere there. Here, look. Now you should be able to see it. What was your blood group? "O." It's interesting this was only done with the Waffen-SS. You would have expected it to be done to all soldiers. To help everyone. But there was an awareness of an elite. Only the Waffen-SS. They came and said, "Show your arm." It was supposed to be your blood group in case you're wounded. But many also said that they did it to mark us forever. The Waffen-SS had nothing to do with the terrible and brutal treatment of Jews and dissidents and the concentration camps. The SS had nothing to do with it whatsoever. Nothing in the slightest. We were always frontline soldiers. We were never involved in actions behind the front. Always at the front, eye to eye with the enemy. Nothing else. I have no regrets, and I will never regret being with that unit. Truly not. A camaraderie like that You could rely on every man one hundred percent. There was nothing that could go wrong. That was the beauty of it. That was the beauty of it. Yes. There were SS units who fought on the front line FRIEDRICH EDER SALZBURG, AUSTRIA 1925 - WEHRMACHT and they were merciless. They shot whole villages. Nothing remained standing. The people lay around like dead flies. That too was the SS units. The Russians were already driven out, but with the civilians they did what they liked. There were more dead than alive. The living received us, begging, "Please, please" Generally, the Russians were taken prisoner, with some exceptions, I don't know what percentage. But I saw exceptions where the ordinary soldiers Not the elite troops. They drove away with their tanks. were shot. And buried in a mass grave. They had to dig their own graves when we put them in there Well, I wasn't there. When they were forced to dig, they knew they would be shot. Did they talk to one another? Not at all. There was a deathly silence. We were in the Pripyat swamps. A doctor and three medical orderlies. And we were attached to a Hungarian SS unit. And allegedly, they found ammunition in a village. We witnessed as they started to set the houses on fire. The people flooded out from their homes. There was thick smoke everywhere. It was like a film. It was a dark night, and these troops are on their rather small horses, and they're riding back and forth, shooting like savages. It was like a cowboy film. In the middle was a house that was bigger than the rest. It may have belonged to the mayor. And when the people ran into this house, it too was set on fire. When the people inside could no longer stand the heat and smoke, they ran out of the house. Machine guns had been set up outside, and as they ran out they were just cut down. The whole village was wiped out. Women and children and men who were just who would have burned alive if they didn't come out, and if they came out, they were shot. What was the role of the medical personnel? We had no role. We never got the chance. If a grenade had been thrown and had injured a few Hungarian SS, then perhaps -If the SS men had been hurt -Yes. Why did your officer not write a report? I don't know. I can't say. Perhaps they didn't want one. What do you mean? What is not in the archives does not exist. And then we withdrew further with the tank and drove through a village, which was engulfed in flames. And I didn't know that this I didn't know about the "scorched earth" order. Hitler instigated a "scorched earth" policy. At the Führer's command, no house should fall into the hands of the Russians. He hoped the Russian advance could be slowed down that way. Yes, it was cruel. But I did not care who burned. On 20 January, 1942, in the Berlin suburb of Wannsee, senior Nazi officials met to discuss the implementation of the "final solution," the mass murder of all of Europe's Jews. On 9 May, 2011, former SS man Hans Werk met a group of young students at the site of the Wannsee Conference. Their identities have been protected. You said you are ashamed to be German? -Is that correct? -No, I didn't say that. I am ashamed today that I joined this organization. That I was proud to serve in the Leibstandarte and that I was proud to bear this tattoo. And our leader, the hero, hid in his bunker like a coward and shot himself and escaped responsibility. And Adolf and his clique brought us disaster. They've caused us to lose our homeland. And I lost my honor. -And what? -My honor! But you were full of honor and pride back then. -What was I? -If you'd kept your honor You are ashamed now that you had the honor of standing for your fatherland? -I don't understand. -No, he's ashamed that I'm ashamed of the crimes committed. To stand up for the fatherland is something completely different. Everybody goes soft on camera. Think about it. The majority cheered when they bombed London and Coventry to ash, knowing that women and children were killed. These are the consequences of letting ourselves be seduced. -No. -Of course that's the result. The concentration camps in Germany, the destruction of Warsaw. Wherever you go today, you have to be ashamed! Anybody in this room with a weakness of character will now think, "Shit, I'm German. What am I going to do now?" That's what you're doing right now. You are judging people, even though you just said it's not our fault. Somebody with a weakness of character will think, "Oh, no. I am German. I must be ashamed my whole life." Why don't you show your face? Why are you such a coward? Look at the camera and say what you think. You won't do that. Then I'll get a criminal conviction and will be persecuted by the state. I say you are one of them! Why are you hiding? Because I'll be made out to be a criminal. -Why? You won't be -Of course I will. That's rubbish. In your eyes, I'm a criminal, just like your old comrades. Then I would have to be afraid that Nazis will set my house on fire. What nonsense. -Shouldn't I? -I don't believe it, really. When I speak so openly. You should be afraid that some Albanian stabs you on public transport. You should be afraid of that but not of your own kind. I'm getting agitated, but really one should stay calm. -Yeah, but you're not doing it either. -Enough now. I belonged to a murderous organization. What else was it? What else was it? But innocent women One can think that one's actions are wrong. Even very wrong. But innocent women, because they were Jewish or Gypsies or because they were weak physically or were sickly, they were killed by injection. Euthanasia I remember a man called Franz Lemke. We used to tease him as a kid. One day he was gone. It turned out they injected him in Landsberg. Gone. We were told that those who were "unworthy of life" had to be destroyed. "Unworthy of life." We carried it out to perfection, planned at the Wannsee Conference, here in this house, around a table just like this one. In comfort, over coffee, they decided how the Jews, women and children, were to be killed. By this horrid method. I cannot be proud of that. I am ashamed of that. It can't be taken for granted that a Jew would wish to talk to an SS man like me, who was convinced that what Adolf did was right. Think about what that means. I met 23-year-old German Jews. Germans. Their fathers were in the war. An old Jewish lady more than 80 years old told me, "My father was in the First World War. He received medals. He did not want to believe the Nazis would kill him. He refused to flee Germany." You can imagine what happened. For me, this is too much. Well, I believe that. But I believe it is important to talk to young people like you. I ask only this of you: Do not let yourself be blinded! Are you still proud today that you were a member of the Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler? Of course. Not just anyone could join. You mean it was An elite. You could say that. Are you willing to accept that the Leibstandarte was involved in the murder of the Jews, amongst others? How can you say this is an elite in a moral sense? They weren't involved in those murders. But the SS? Maybe. I don't know. I never witnessed it. Will you acknowledge that the SS was a criminal organization? -No. -You won't accept that? I won't accept that. I would dirty myself if I were to admit to that. And I don't want that. The entire SS was recognized as a criminal organization at the Nuremberg trials. But not by a German court. So I won't accept that. So you are saying that the reports that came out later about the murder of the Jews in the extermination camps -It's said to be six million. -That's a joke. One million, maybe a little more, in Auschwitz. Yes. I don't believe it. I will not believe it. It can't be. Today they say Excuse me, but it's the Jew who puts it like that. The scale that is claimed today, I deny that too. I deny it. It didn't happen. I can't imagine that, back home, so many horrible things happened. I don't know. The majority of those under Nazism said after the war, again and again, firstly, "I didn't know," secondly, "I didn't take part," and thirdly, "If I had known, I would have acted differently." Everybody tried to distance themselves from the massacres committed under Nazism, especially those of the final years. And that's why so many said, "I wasn't a Nazi." An SS officer was lying next to me. And an American officer came to his bed and said, "Are you a Nazi?" to this SS officer. And he said, "Yes, I am." The American officer shook hands with this SS officer and said, "The first German to admit that he was a Nazi. A pleasure to meet you." Later I asked myself what would I have said to this American officer if he had asked me, "Are you Nazi?" Probably the same as everybody else. "I was forced to. I had to join the Hitler Youth." And so on. I wouldn't have said I was a Nazi. We are, at least, complicit in other people's crimes. We can't be accused of being active perpetrators. We didn't do that. We didn't beat or imprison anyone or anything like that. But we went along with it. How can you claim that you didn't imprison anyone when you were a camp guard, a member of the SS Death's Head A valid question. A very valid question. That's when complicity begins to turn into guilt. That's why I got out. At what point does complicity make you a perpetrator? Complicity begins by going there in the first place. Not to have turned around straightaway. We didn't dare. Nobody walked away. Let's say there was an order to exterminate Jews. If, as a policeman or a soldier, I am forced to help round up Jews and take them to a concentration camp, what does that make me? If I go voluntarily, I am definitely a perpetrator. If I am ordered to do it, has perpetration already begun if I say, "Jews, move along"? I don't know. I can't answer that question. What else could I have done? If I had refused, I could have been put against the wall and shot. Did you yourself ever hear of this happening? No, never. There is no record of it happening in the literature, either. I never heard of it. If you had received such an order, what would you have done? Yes, that is a good question. If 99 men had said yes before me, I might have participated as well. The main responsibility for the mass murder of the Jews in World War II In the Second World War, that remains with the Germans. It is the stigma they will bear for the rest of their lives. But I don't feel part of the collective guilt of the Germans. So who is to blame for these atrocities? God will be the judge of that. God will be the judge of that. Put the good Lord aside. -No. -I would like to have your opinion. -Yes, but -The good Lord doesn't sit opposite me. -No, but my opinion -I can't ask him the question. That means I'd like you to But I feel I'm ashamed as a German. Because something so cruel happened in the German name. With this meticulousness. With this bookkeeping accuracy. When it comes to judging, I would differentiate between those who did it and Actually, they were all perpetrators. They were all perpetrators. The concentration camp guard, do you consider him a perpetrator? Well, yes. I was one of them. I feel like a perpetrator. I've always said we didn't know, but in the end, we are perpetrators too. We let it happen. We should have got to the bottom of it. So, in the end, we are perpetrators too. Whether I consider myself a perpetrator? That's such a broad question. I wouldn't have been a perpetrator if I'd had the courage to say "no" at any point. So you could say if I didn't do that, I am a perpetrator. That's an easy answer, of course. But I can't be convicted as a perpetrator because really I was an ideological perpetrator and not a But let's finish now, shall we? So you are not willing to blame Hitler? No. For you, Hitler is not responsible? I will not blame him. You will not blame him? Do you still honor him? I certainly do. The idea was correct. And the murder of the Jews, was that also correct? That's what Hitler -No, I don't share that opinion. -Sorry? I don't share the opinion that they should be murdered. They should have been driven out to another country, where they could rule themselves. This would have saved a great deal of grief. The mass murder of six million Jews, carried out in the name of Germany, has brought indescribable suffering to the Jewish people, Europe and the entire world. The Shoah fills us Germans with shame. I bow before the victims. I bow before the survivors and before all those who helped them survive.
