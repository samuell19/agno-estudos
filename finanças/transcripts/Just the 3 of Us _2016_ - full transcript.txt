Tell us, why are you here? I'm here because I want to move forward. - I believe it's the only way to go. - Hi, sir! That's true. But is that all? Well, I'm here because I love my job. What do you love about your job? I have control. Your leg. Prepare for the approach. Everything! I love that my job is full of structure and focus. Flying gives me a sense of direction and purpose. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. - This is your First Officer… - I think I have a cool job. I get to work with different people every day. And because of that, every flight is a unique and exciting experience. Weather en route is also good. On behalf of Captain Manzano and our lovely and hardworking cabin crew, this is your First Officer A bus a do, we thank you for flying with us and we hope to see you again on one of your future flights. - Thank you! - Liberty 111, request descent. Imagine two people flying a very complex machine that's a thousand times bigger than the two of them combined with a million moving parts working together to defy the laws of gravity. Minimum. Good landing, Uno! Thank you, Captain. Or should I say, soon-to-be Captain A bus a do. And there are only a few of us in the country, even in the whole world, who can do that. - Right, Captain? - Yeah. And I say that with pride and confidence. Because I worked hard for this, owed debts for this, and strived for all of this. For what? Your file says no parents, no siblings. No ring. And? Most people want an upgrade for their families. Whom are you doing this for? For the passengers. So I can bring them home safe to their families. After all, that's our company's promise, right? "We always bring you home." Look, the only reason I deserve this upgrade is this: I am a pilot, and I'm a damn good one! Uno, don't forget my party. Go ahead. I'll follow. Okay, see you. Jen! Is this new? - Yes, sir. - I'll get one. Okay, sir. I'll get one for you. Yes, dear. The one you like isn't available. They only have the jeep. All right. No problem. I love you, dear. Bye! Miss, I'll take this. Sure, sir. Happy birthday to you! - Blow! - Yay! Cheers! - Happy birthday! - Thank you. Have a seat, guys. - Happy birthday. - Thank you, dude. - Happy birthday. - Thank you. Uno, at the next party, I'm sure you'll be at that table with the other captains. Yes! You passed the interview? - You took the ATPL already? - Yep! Ground schooling and simulator training start next week. - Cool! - Nice! - Congrats, man! - Cheers! Let's celebrate! A toast… …to the future Captain A bus a do! - Sounds good! - Yes! Next goal? A Mrs. A bus a do! Never! Go, boys! Thank you. Oh! Wow. Sorry. Uno! Whoa! Give me some blow job! Dude… That's Mrs. Maniego! Monica! - Sorry! - Sorry! I have to go! I have to go! No! Hey! I have a flight in 15 hours! Dude, you still have 3 hours! I'm saving that for my wife. Just enough for short time! I have to go. Behave yourself! Bye. What are you doing later? My goodness… Put it there. Uno, you might know pilots looking for a place. Can you help us? Okay. Sir, plain wash or wash and fold? Sir Uno! I'll take care of these. Thanks, Boy. - He's a regular customer. - I see. - Thank you. - Ah, finally! I love you, sis! Sir Uno! 8,000 each again? Yeah, but send the one for Davao first. My uncle is waiting. Seems like he's impatient. Here. You following me? Miss? Are you okay? I'm pregnant. Oh… Congrats? Congrats to you too. You're gonna be a father. Really? This baby is yours. I swear. You do know those things are not 100% accurate, right? 99.99%, see? There's still that. 01% inaccuracy. What?! For all I know, you could've gotten a random pregnant lady to pee on that. Here's a new pack. I'll pee on this. Come and see for yourself. Granted that you're pregnant, it still doesn't prove that it's mine. I don't even know your name. There was no chance for that. Things happened so fast. But you know me. We see each other every week. He smiled at me! You're a flight attendant? Not yet. Okay? Not yet. But it's my dream to be one. I want to take my family all over the Philippines and then around the world, to Europe, France… I was that close, but I failed the exam last week. Because you talk too much. If I were the captain and you were the purser, the plane would've already crashed before you alerted me. Get to the point. The point is, I failed the medical exam because I'm pregnant. You got me pregnant. Because of that damn smile. So you got knocked up just because I smiled at you? That's right! You smiled at me at that party! Party? Let's drink some more! - Cheers! - Cheers! - Whoo-hoo! - Nice one! Don't hide those! How will you be a flight attendant if you don't have the guts to flaunt those?! Unbelievable! Here. This will cure your sadness! That's right! Drink it! - Drink this up to start the night! Hurry! - Go! Go! Go! - Go! - Go! Go! Drink it straight! Drink some more! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! See this?! Whoo-hoo! Hey! Behave, okay?! That was you? Why do you look so surprised? That's not how you reacted when we… …did it. You were even moaning! I don't do that! Oh! Oh! Ahh! Ah! But that's still impossible. I mean, I'm always careful. Oh, that?! It fell! Aah! Ouch! Aah! Ow… Aah! Ooh… I thought… …you wanted it that way. Now, do you believe that you're the father of this baby? No. I mean, if you did it with me, you could have done it with a million other guys. I'm not that kind of girl! And you really expect me to believe that? Yes, because I'm telling the truth. I'll only believe that's mine if a doctor tells me so. Fine, let's do a paternity test. Until then… That… …is not mine. Fuck you! What? Fuck you! Hurry up! AJ, BJ! Come on! CJ is coming! DJ and EJ are still playing around! - Hey! Stop that! - You're all still playing around! Stop it, you guys! Come on! You'll ruin the surprise! - Oh! - Hey! - What's the occasion? - We're keeping it a secret for now. I'll tell you once we've confirmed it! All right. - Hey! Hurry up, boys! - EJ and FJ! That's enough! - Hey! - Stop playing around! - Go inside, hurry! - She'll be here any... - CJ! - Huh?! - Aah! Come on! - Hurry! Let's go! - Hurry up! Come on! - Move it! - I'm moving! - Go upstairs! Now! Psst! Stop it! Behave. That wasn't me. - Surprise! - Surprise! - Come here, sis! Hurry! - We did it! - It's time to eat! - Welcome home! - Come, dear. Come in. - Come sit here, CJ! Hurry! - Get her a chair! - Well? - How did it go? - Get her a plate. - Sit here. Hurry. - Well, dear? - What's the result of the test? - Positive? - Is it positive, dear? - Did you get the results? Um… Yes, it's positive. - Whoo-hoo! - All right! Now, we'll get to fly for free! - Nice one, sis! - Oh, hold on! - High five! - Waling, come here! What is it?! CJ is now a flight stewardess! You're so lucky to have such career-orientated children! Your daughter's unlike mine, who does nothing but get pregnant! We're really lucky! - We're going to be rich! - Yeah! CJ, you're our only hope of getting rich because no honest soldier ever gets rich. And no decent policeman ever gets to travel around the world. So, congrats! And, of course, we all salute you! Ha! Hoo! Ha! She's smart, but she's a fool for love. - Hey! Stop picking on your sister! - Ouch! That's enough. She was only a fool for love once. That's not going to happen again, right? That's right, it won't. Well, it better not! Because our surname's Manalo, and that means… We don't abuse others, and we don't let others abuse us! Oppressing people is bad… But allowing yourself to lose is worse! Because our family name means… - Winner! - Winner! Please pass me the noodles. But, Pa… Ma… I still have to undergo training in Manila. What?! For how long?! Um… Nine months. - What?! - That's too long. That is so reckless, my friend. It's so not like you. He was drunk, okay? I blame the alcohol for the reduced hand-eye coordination and poor judgment. And poor memory. He couldn't even remember the girl. If only alcohol had the same effect on the girl. - But it didn't. - And that's the problem. That's because it's hard to forget good-looking faces like ours. Ours too! - All right. - Unbelievable. How soon can I have a DNA test? Um, Doc? On the ninth week, I think. Ninth week? So, in six weeks… You'll be a father. You'll have more expenses. And a lot less sex. Oh no! - Love? Love… - You need to set a good example… …for your child. I'm sure your flying hours will be lessened. Your life… …will change once you become a father. Welcome to my world! Psst! Look what you did! - Did I say something wrong? - Fix it, bro. This will just die here. I can't take care of this. Tsk! Yes, you can! No! I don't want to! Yuck! Please, sis! I'm begging you! I just need someone to introduce to my family as the father of my baby in nine months! - Hi! - I won't do it! Besides, no one will believe that! I mean, look at me! All right, then. If you won't do it, then I'll just borrow your boyfriend here. What do you say? - Aah! Hey! Hey! Hey! - Oh! Isn't it enough that you're staying with us until you give birth? Unbelievable! If you'll keep insisting, then just stay with them! I don't have my own place. And there's no vacancy at our boarding house. If that's the case, then I'll just return you to your family. Then what? Have her dad take down the large banner at the city hall that says: "CJ Manalo, the town's first flight attendant!"? Then have them replace it with one that says: "CJ Manalo, the first disgrace to the Manalo Clan!" If she doesn't want that, then she shouldn't be a bus a do. I'm not an A bus a do! Only my baby is. You sure? I hope that's also what the paternity test will say. Why? Is it possible that… This baby is an A bus a do! Well, she's sure about it. If he doesn't want this baby, then this'll be a Manalo instead. You'll be on the losing end of that setup! If you're sure that's Uno's, then don't let him win! - That's right! - Fight for your right! - Ask for child support! - Ask him to co-parent the baby. That's right! You must be confidently beautiful with a heart and a baby! You must be like a Manalo or a winner! - I will be a winner! - Because your last name's Manalo! Because I'm a Manalo! - Manalo! Manalo! - Manalo! Manalo! Come on! Hurry! Wait, is that him?! It is?! Wait! Excuse me. - How about next time? - Sure. - Hey, A bus a do! Sorry… - Oh… I'll follow you there, Captain. Sorry. Sorry. - Sorry! - Um, yes, Miss… It's Manalo. Can we talk? Yes, in six weeks. Six... Why six weeks?! Because it's the soonest possible time that we can get a paternity test. That's such a long time. My baby and I might be dead by then. You're exaggerating. You see, I quit my job. I was just supposed to go on leave, but I couldn't go on leave for a long time. I don't have a job anymore. That's not my problem. It's your problem too. I have a flight. Hey! - Yikes. - Oh no. I quit my job because you knocked me up. Huh?! I didn't want to hurt my family, so I told them I'd be undergoing training in Manila for nine months. So they can't see me around here. You're the one who lied and quit your job, so don't drag me into your problems. That's not what I'm doing. I'm just asking for your help so that I could give our child a good life! Oh, look! It's your dad! - Hey! - Stop. If I were you, I'd go before someone sees you here. Liberty Pacific Flight 415 from Davao is now arriving. I forgot to buy durian for my mom. Let's just buy one later when we go back to Davao for the next leg. Too bad. She's all yours. Hey. Waiting for someone? Yes. You. Well? Are you going to help us or not? No. A bus a do! See you later, Daddy! Oh, you arrogant idiot! If it weren't for you, baby, I'd punch your dad! Oh! Welcome back, Daddy! Well? Are you going to help us now? No! You're already a father? She's just crazy. Let's go. - So you're a father now. - Come on. There are lots of mosquitoes here. Oh! Go! Go! You can do it! Go, sis! Whoo! I'm not moving! You're really crazy, aren't you? I'm a crazy mommy! One who'll do everything for her baby! I'm not moving until you help me and our baby. It's just your baby. It's your baby too! So you say. Because I am sure! But I don't believe you. Until a test proves it's mine, that problem remains yours and yours alone. No! Until proven otherwise, this baby is yours! Your sperm and my egg made this baby! Okay. Fine. No. I'm going to help you. Okay? Just prove it to me now. How? Do you hear yourself?! Does your sperm have a name tag? Precisely my point! Alleluia! Finally! You're impossible. What? Miss, you're the one who's impossible! You're unreasonable too! You want me to help you?! Huh?! I don't even know you. We're not related at all. We may not be related, but you and my baby are. Then, prove it first. Tsk! We keep going in circles here! If I could afford to not eat for six weeks and keep my baby from starving, then I wouldn't be bothering you here! Do you think it's easy to ask for help from someone who won't have anything to do with us? Well, who told you to lie to your parents? Who told you to quit your job? No one. I made the decision on my own. But I was really just so confused. It was my first time doing that. I'm talking about what happened between us. It was my first time doing it with a guy who's not my boyfriend. I only got drunk that night because they told me that alcohol was the cure for my sadness. And it just so happened… …that you came along. And… You were so cute. What the fuck can I do? Please. I just don't want to hurt my family. I don't want to embarrass them. I don't want them to become everyone's laughing stock because their daughter who's supposed to be a flight attendant… Had a one-night stand with a stranger. Don't you feel bad for me… Daddy? My head hurts! Ouch! It hurts! You heartless man, bring me to the hospital! To the mental hospital? I can't breathe! Help! I can't breathe! My chest! I can't breathe! Sucks to be you. Ouch. Ouch. Look… Miss… I'm really tired right now and I don't have time for this shit. So, please get away from my car and let me rest please, Miss. Miss! My baby! Sir! You can come in. You're the father, right? - Yes! - Maybe. We'll find out in a few weeks. Doc, how's the baby? The bleeding you had was caused by subchorionic hemorrhage. This is normal during the first trimester but you need to be extra careful. You need to avoid heavy activities. No stress. The formation of the baby can be affected by stress and the environment. We want a healthy baby, right? Two hands. Two feet. You're saying that… The baby might only have one hand? Yes. Just two fingers? Deformed eyes? - A cleft lip? - What the… Well, if a mother is exposed to a bad environment… Yes. How will you go home? I'll ride a jeepney. Hey. Wait. - Go home, you drunkard! - Leave me alone! - You bastard! - I want to drink! Inside! Now! Balut! Hey! Hurry up! Anyway… Thanks. Can I park here? Yeah, just leave it there. There aren't a lot of cars here anyway. ♪ Happy birthday! ♪ This guy's drunk! Weak! Weak! Hey! Sorry. Excuse me. - There are tissues inside. - Sorry, sir. This guy's hopeless. Hey, I need tissues. Tissues! Someone barfed on him. Gosh! - Who needs it? - It's for his shoes. You're stressing me out. You messed up my things. Oh! Get up! Get up! Come in! Get up and get dressed. Everything okay? Oh! As if you're not used to this! Ta-da! Your favorite dinner! Smells good! Sorry. We're all out of vinegar. Gosh! Die! Die! You freeloading cockroach! You animal! I'm fine without vinegar. Get your things. What? The baby can't live here. Where will I live? Why is the sign still up here? Sorry. I forgot to take it down. Don't you have any vacant units? Maybe next month. I already found a tenant earlier. Okay. What's up? Six weeks. If after six weeks, I prove that it's not mine, you disappear. If I prove it's yours? Will I stay? We'll cross the bridge when we get there. But for now, you're only here because of the baby. I'm giving you shelter for the baby's own good. You'll pay for all of the baby's needs? Like what? - Food. Checkups. - Okay. Yes. Vitamins, medicines. Yes and yes. Food. You already said that. There are two of us, right? Is that all? There's one more. The… Never mind. Hey! Stop. Rule number one: You don't touch my stuff. How can I do that? These are all your stuff. I'm not allowed to touch anything? Well, this you can touch. This too. Just replace them. These… Upon need basis. Same goes for this. And this… There's just one. Does this mean we'll share? No. This is yours. My chair. Your chair. And this… …is for us? …Is mine. Rule number two: You can't go into my room. Okay. So, I'll stay here? Never… …open this door. Then that's my room. You like it there? There. I'll stay there. Attagirl! Sweet dreams. What?! Can you lower the volume a bit? I can't sleep when it's noisy. I can't sleep when it's quiet. I'm having a hard time sleeping... I'm having a hard time sleeping with one pillow. Wait. Here you go. Can you now… Can you turn it down a bit now? My house. My rules. Hey! Rule number one. Just looking. No touching. I prepared your breakfast. Cereals, juice, fresh milk. Is this your breakfast? You can have the other half. I'll get a new one! What time are you coming home? Sorry. I got carried away. Uno! What? I'm going to buy some groceries. I just wanted to ask if you need anything. Try not to lose it. Thank you, daddy! Huh? Bye, daddy! Hi. Imagine that. Who would've thought… I thought you only had instant noodles. But now you have an instant baby. And an instant wife too. Shut up. She's not my wife. She's just the mother of my supposed baby. That's the only reason why you're letting her stay at your place? Yeah. I don't want to feel guilty if anything happens to the baby, whether it's mine or not. He's growing a conscience. He's growing a heart, you mean? I can hear it beating. It's here somewhere. It's beating and it's calling out a name. Stop it, you two. You're stressing me out. You can't be stressed! Or they won't let you fly on your next flight. I know! So stop stressing me out! This is the only thing going right for me. I don't want to screw this up too. Hi, again! Can I help you? How do you know Mr. Crush? What? You called him "Daddy." But you're too old to be his daughter. He's my baby's daddy. - You're his wife? - No. Girlfriend? - Nope. - Then, what? Um… It's hard to explain. I'm not sure you'll understand. I'm the top student in my class. I'll get it. Oh, no! You'll be late for school! It's a Saturday. I still have a lot of chores. See you later. I can wait. I'm not in a hurry. Wow! My cactus is still alive. That's yours? I gave it to him. Why? So he'll have a living thing for a companion. Huh? Well, he's been living alone ever since we moved next door. And no one ever visits him, either. Not even his parents? He's an orphan? Girlfriend? Nope. Relatives? Friends? What about her? We can't touch it. Nope. Really? Not a single person? Yes! You're the first person Mr. Crush has ever brought here. That's why you're really special. So, even if it hurts me, it's okay. At least Mr. Crush won't be alone anymore. He won't be sad. Good evening. Why'd you lock the bolt too? To keep intruders out. Yeah. But I couldn't get in either. We each have a key, so no one gets bothered. It's okay. You can wake me up. So at least I know you're home. Well, I don't want to. I don't want anyone waiting for me. Okay. I'll just heat your dinner. You touched my stuff? No. These are mine. Those are yours. I bought this. Look. And this too. So, you have a lot of money? No. I already spent it all. And it's my fault? No. I take full responsibility. Hold on, let me heat this. Miss Manalo… What are you doing? I'll just heat your food. Because? Because baby and I don't want you to be hungry, or sad. What makes you think that I am? See? You don't know me. And I think it's best that it stays that way. Remember… You're only here until… …the paternity test. Are we clear? Yes, Captain. Whatever makes you happy. Sorry, baby. Captain Daddy is just tired. Good morning! Want some fish? There's coffee, tea, milk… Hello, Pa! - How are you? - I'm okay! I'm getting ready for my FA training. I'll be all right, Pa. He's kind of grumpy. And he rarely smiles. But I know, deep, deep, deep down inside, he's a good person. - Dear, FJ has a situation… - What? What happened to him? What happened to FJ? He got sick after spending hours under the sun… - …courting a girl. - Oh. He's all grown up now. Don't worry about it, Pa. I'll take care of it. - Thank you, CJ. - Okay. Sure. I love you, Pa. Bye! Hey, A bus a do! Yes? Well… Let me guess? It's about money? Yes. Someone's sick? Birthday? Someone's sick. How did you know? Those people only call when they need something. My family isn't like that. How about you? Is that how your family treats you? I don't think your parents are like that. Here. What about the money for the baby? I'm sorry. I don't want to keep depending on you. But I'm just strapped for cash. I promise to pay you back. - Really? - Of course! I'm actually looking for an online job. My options are limited since I have a delicate pregnancy. But… - I was hoping… - Yes? - I could borrow... - Laptop. - You want to borrow my laptop. - You're good! You can be a psychic. Later! Thank you! I knew it! Deep down, your daddy's a good guy. Good night, uncle. Good night. - I'll follow in a bit. - Good night. I don't get it. We had an agreement. You'd stay out of each other's way! I told her… - You don't need to… - Cook for me… -…worry about me, -or wait up for me. And now? I need to worry about her all the time. - Why? - Are we in a relationship? Exactly! We get it, bro. You've been saying that over and over. Bro… Can't we have the paternity test done sooner? Which means you have six weeks to go. Which means I have to go. All right! - Me too. - What? - I have a hearing tomorrow. - Good night, bro. You just live nearby. - I need to go to the gym. - Bye. Take care, man. What do you plan to do with your body? You guys are so lame! Hey, you. You don't have an excuse. Sit down. Daddy! Okay, okay. Fine. Take care, man. Dude, last question. How are you able to deal with all that? Love? So… Love is the only way I can survive all this? You should start with acceptance first. Take care. "Just in case you're hungry." Well, that's a good start. Appreciating that she's a good mom. I didn't say she's a good mom. Okay. At least, potentially a good mom. Uno, did you see the change in pairing? Captain Nicolas had to attend to an emergency. Does it have to be Captain Gatchalian? There's no one else? He's the only other pilot available. Don't you want to fly with him? A bus a do. - Hi, Captain. - Captain. I'm flying with you. I'll see you in the briefing room. The thing is, we knew you'd have to fly with him someday. Just get it over and done with. Mach Alt Star. Alt cruise. Headsets off. You should've rotated the aircraft at 3 degrees per second for obstacle clearance. There was no obstacle. Keep that up, so when you take off from Tagbilaran, you'll head straight for the mountains. Where are your grade slips? They say you're the best in your class. What will you do in case of engine failure? Engine failure thrust. MCT. Auto thrust off. Then advise ATC. What's next? You're missing a step. Divert to the nearest airport and try to relight the engine. This is the first time I'm flying with you. Are you usually this tense? You seem unfocused. Is there a problem? No problem, Captain. Damn him. What's new? I'm always wrong. Everything I do is wrong. That prick even asked me… "Is there a problem?" Unbelievable. I should've said, "Yes! I have a problem! It's you! You're my problem!" Ma, I don't get it. Why'd you have to die? It should've been him. Not you, Ma. I hate that guy. I hate him! Drink this. No. Come on. Even just a bit. You'll thank me in the morning. Come on. No. Thank you. Drink a bit. Come on. Hey! Hey… So, she's your mom. Where's your dad? Are you mad at him? Baby, look at your poor daddy. Good thing, we're here. We'll take care of you… And love you. It's not hard to love you. You have nice eyes… Nose… And… Your lips. That's why I fell for him, baby. He's so handsome. Oh no. I thought he heard me. Go on. Try to be mean to me now. Oh no! Our baby made a mess. Poor baby… Our baby daddy made a mess. Gosh… WE'RE JUST HERE IF YOU NEED SOMEONE TO TALK TO. Touchdown in Cebu will be at 9:30 a... 9:45 a.m. Um… On behalf of our hardworking crew, this has been your captain, Captain A bus a do, thanking you for flying Liberty Pacific and we do hope to see you again soon. You look uneasy again, Captain A bus a do. Do you have a problem? Girlfriend? Family? No, Captain. Well, whatever… Or whoever that problem is, forget it. Because you're just setting yourself up for a mistake. Captain! I'm sorry, baby. The flight was delayed. Captain! I'm on my way home. I have something for you and your brother. I love you, baby. I'll see you in a bit. - Yes? - I don't deserve an S minus! What didn't you understand from our debriefing? Everything! My smooth take-off and landing? What was wrong with that? As I said, it's not the SOP because it's not safe. Okay. Even my PA? The tension in my voice? Yes! Because the passengers need to know that you're calm. That they're in safe hands. Don't forget our company promise. "We always bring people home back to their families." That's bullshit! Excuse me? What did you say? What did you hear? As pilots, we are responsible for people. That's why we don't bring our problems into the cockpit. Our emotional state can compromise a flight. You look bothered since yesterday. I asked you. You said... I don't have a problem! Are you sure? Because that's the only reason for your poor performance. That… Or you're just plain incompetent. If you have any more concerns, you can bring it up with Training and Standards. Do you still have a question for me, Mr. A bus a do? None. But do you have a question for me? Do you have a question about me? Do you want to know how I've been the last 32 years? No? Not one question? You don't have any questions because you don't care about me. Because you chose to walk away! Because you chose to forget me! Because you didn't want me! You didn't want to be responsible for me! And you know who chose to be responsible for me? The nurse in the delivery room! She took me when my mother died after giving birth. And when no one came to claim me after a week, when they called my father to tell him that he had a son, you never came! I've waited all my life for this. To show you that I survived without you. That I've made something of myself without you! That I'm better than you even though you treated me like trash. I didn't know... I never wanted to tell you… That I'm the mistake you chose to forget. I didn't say you were a mistake... No! You didn't! But that's how you made me feel! And now, you're going to fail me as a pilot? Fuck you! To me, you've been a failure since forever! Not only as a father but as a human being! Hey! Are you okay? What's the problem? A clumsy FA? No. Bad flight? Unruly passenger? No. You didn't like your training officer? - Please! Stop talking. - Is it about last night? When you were crying about your mom? Please, I just want to be alone right now. Please. Where's my beer? I put it outside. You threw them out?! I just hid them. Huh? Why did you do that? Because you might get drunk again. So what?! This is my life! You shouldn't care even if I swim in alcohol! You're the father of my baby. I don't want him to think that you're a drunkard. Whatever. Wait! You know, problems… You should cry about them… Talk about them… Don't just drink to forget about them. Are you deaf or stupid? I'm just concerned. Whatever that is, it will pass. You don't know that! Okay?! So please get out of my way and shut up! Okay, I'll shut up. But please tell me about it. I'll listen. Tell me everything! Hey! That's what friends are for! Friends? We're not friends. What about… Housemates? Housemates? You're not my housemate. Guest. You're just a guest. Actually, not even that! You're just a random girl I fucked in the bathroom! That hurts. Well, truth hurts! All the time! It fucking hurts all the time! I should know because it hurts up to this day and I have to live with it! I have to live with the fact that he will never want me. That he will never care about me! That he will never love me! And it makes me mad because even now that I'm older, and now that I've achieved a lot in my life… I still want to matter to my father even if I don't matter to him at all! Sorry, I didn't know. Why? If you knew, would it help me? Huh? Would you have done something? You can't even do anything about that problem in your tummy! You're a jerk! If this baby is just a problem to you, it isn't for me. If you wanna be like your father, go ahead. You're so mean. I just wanted to help. I'm sorry. I felt so small after begging you for help, but I swallowed my pride for my baby. But I won't let my baby feel small only because his father sees him as a problem. I'd rather raise this kid alone… Than with you and your never-ending problems. Ouch! Why? Hey, what's wrong? Ouch! What's happening? It hurts! It was a threatened miscarriage, Ms. Manalo. I don't see any health problems with you and your baby. I'm sure that's just stress. Didn't I tell you to stay away from stress? Have you been doing any strenuous activity lately? No. Have you been getting angry or emotional these days? You see, Ms. Manalo… You should avoid whatever or whoever gets you stressed! Erase it! Your baby can sense all the negative vibes. And if he can no longer take it, the baby might swim out of your tummy on its own. Okay? Okay. You can eat here. The baby might get squished. For the baby. "Thank you." Says the baby. Cor blimey! I'm chuffed to bits about that! Oh! What is that, sir? Chuffed? - Oh! - He means he's happy. Huh? Oh! Oh! That's great! Very well indeed, sir! I will send the email first thing tomorrow morning. - Okay? - Thanks! - Bye, sir! - Bye. I'll buy some groceries. Does the baby need something? No. I already bought it. You? Okay. You want to come instead? I still have work. Okay. I'll just see you later. Stop! Don't get fooled by that smile again. Where's that? Sorry… I was wondering if you saw my baby book. It's missing. It's just there. Okay. Thank you. Delayed flight? So you've accepted it? Soon, you might be in love with CJ already. Silly! Hey, what happened? She's got a headache… And a nosebleed! Huh? Nosebleed? With all her English! Bloody English. Wait. Continue the massage. Hold on. Hi baby! Hello… Please tell your mommy to drink this. I won't give anything that's harmful to her… …or to you. And while you're at it, please tell your mommy… …that I'm sorry. I'm trying my best for you… …for the both of you. So please, ask her to be friends with me. Please? Please… Miss CJ, forgive him already. Smile. Captain! What's the problem? Are you writing a novel? Novel? He can't even get a word in. Good with the ladies? He can't handle a simple message. I'll do it. I'll do it. Me, I got this. Hey, I'll do it. ♪ I call you ♪ ♪ And you call me ♪ ♪ It's funny how we get on so easily ♪ For the baby. Thank you. For mommy too. Locked jaw.

Here, talk to the baby. - Love you, baby! - There you go! That's it! Baby… Say goodbye to Daddy! Bye, Daddy! I love you! I love you too… Baby! I love you too, baby! Baby! - Who is CJ with? - I don't know. I think there's something. - What? - Are they together? Cook the noodles faster! Happy birthday, Pa! Good morning, sir! You're with my daughter in Manila? Yes, sir. You're a flight attendant? Pilot, sir. Ah… So, you're also a captain? Are you a pilot? I'm the village captain. Why are you and CJ together? Are you courting my sister? No drugs allowed. No cheaters allowed. No heartbreakers allowed. Maybe you're just like... Let him talk. So, Uno? What are you to my daughter? Everyone! I'd like to introduce to you the newest member of the family! My would-be son-in-law, Uno! Let's eat! Uno! Uno! What did you tell them? I told them… I'm your boyfriend. Come on, hurry! Let's eat! Uno, eat as many as you want. - Don't be shy. - Yes, ma'am. - The food is good. - Thank you. Hey, Uno! Don't you get scared when flying a plane? Not really. In fact, a lot of pilots I know are scared of heights. Perfect! You can be one! You want to? Just be focused. You have to relate to people well. You should know how to be a leader. Then you can be a pilot. I can bring you to the flight simulator if you want. - Really? - Wow! Why just him? You won't fit! We'll join you! If you want, I can bring all of you. Wow! No, it's too much. Wait, we're allowed to. So, you also have to join our fiesta next month. What do you want to eat? I'll cook it for you. Beef jerky with a lot of… - Vinegar! - Vinegar! Great! - That's mom's specialty! - That's delicious. I won't miss that. Then, you should join our team! You know how to play basketball? These are losers! - Come on! - Look who's talking! Sure. I'm game! All right. What's your last name? We'll make your jersey. A bus a do. Seriously? Ugly, right? Here… We'll just put you as Manalo. You're part of the family, anyway. Wow! - Sure. - That's it! Hey, you don't have to say yes to everything. It's okay. I want to. I'm so happy that they accepted me. Thank you for making me part of your family. So, I guess it's time for you… …to know me… …and my family. Oh, your mom… You two are so cute. She's the one who adopted me. That was our last picture together before she died. Her relatives passed me around until I grew up. And I'm still paying them to this day for all they spent on me. But we're here now. Me… …and your baby. Before… I only loved my mom… …and flying. Until… Until you… …and you. You really are a winner! It's time to celebrate! Bring out the roasted pig! - Jill! - What? - Uno wants to meet us. - Then, let's go! Come on! - I can't wait! - Baby, the money for the food. Oh, yeah, I almost forgot. - I told you so. - Oh my… - Hey, we have to... - What?! Where's CJ? She's not here. She's gone. She's with someone now. How are you guys? - How is she? - Oh, she's great! Really, really great. So just go back to your girls in Davao, in Cebu, hell, even in Timbuktu! - I've changed. - Liar! We've heard that before. Leave our friend alone. She's already happy with Uno, and she's having a baby. That's right! She's having a baby? Yes. And it's not yours. Let's go. Cap! Your flight is delayed. The ATC withheld the departure of your aircraft in Mactan. For how long? An hour and 30 minutes? All right. Hey, Uno. Isn't it your day off? I'm on reserve. I'm supposed to fly two legs, but my flight's delayed. And CJ and I have an appointment. Cap, we're sorry, but there's an additional 45-minute delay. What?! You should've told me earlier. The message just came in, Cap. You know, I don't think I can make this flight. I have an emergency. I'm sorry, but you have to call someone else. - Wait! Hey! - You're not flying anymore? If you're suspended, your captaincy might get delayed! I can't delay my being a dad. Oh my god! Gotta go guys! See you later! Miss! Where's the ultrasound department? - On the fifth floor, sir. - Thank you. Paging Dr. Chiu, please proceed to the E.R. Dr. Chiu, to the E.R., please. - Miss, is this…? - Yes, sir. Inside. Later. - Wait... - Hold it. I missed it? Yeah. Joke! We're just about to start. Come on. Why, you... And you! - Come on! - Ready? Let's start. Wait, wait. There. There's your baby. You see? Hey. Can you hear me? I'm your daddy. Can you hear me? Hi. I think… …his grandparents should meet him. What is it? Later. When Ma and Pa get here. - Hurry up, DJ. - Come on, Uno, just tell us. Your sister might beat me up. Just tell us. Let's not wait for Ma and Pa. CJ! - They're here? - It's… How are you? What are you doing here? Nothing. Hi, CJ. How are you? Why are you here? I just wanted to talk to you. We have nothing to talk about. Really? I heard you're pregnant. - What? - CJ? So, I'm the only one who knows? Don't you want me to meet… …our baby? This isn't yours. It's Uno's. You know what? I don't think so. It's Uno's. Leave. - Wait, we have to... - Stop. Just leave. - Are you sure? - Leave. Wait! Wait! - Wait! Babe, I love you! - Come on! I'll be a good dad to our baby! Who was that? Your ex? Ancient history. We broke up a long time ago. It's been so long. Six months ago. So why is he assuming he's the father of your baby? Why did he ask? Whatever gave him the idea? Because the last time we saw each other, he told me he still loves me. So, stupid little me gave in and got fooled again. I slept with him. And I regret it. It shouldn't have happened. When was that? Huh? When was the last time you had sex with him? Two, three months ago? So when was that? Huh? Before the night we had sex at the party? Yes. Fuck. But you're the dad! This is our baby... Why? Because you said so?! Because I'm sure! I got my period after Marco and I had sex... Again, I'm just supposed to believe that because you said so?! Uno, when did I ever lie to you? The whole time! You never told me you had sex with your ex! Why? Did I ever ask you for a list of all the girls you slept with?! Yes, I didn't tell you about Marco! But I never deceived you! I didn't lie to you! You lied, CJ! You were not completely honest! You should have told me about Marco! But why?! What for?! I didn't need to tell you that! - It's not an issue! - It is the issue! Goddamn it, CJ! You let me believe I was the father of that child. If there's any chance at all that I'm not the father, I should know! I should know if I'm being set up for a big heartbreak! Uno, you are the father. I chose to love that baby even if I never met him. Even if I never knew him. I had hopes and dreams for him. Sometimes, they became more important than my own dreams, even more than my captaincy, CJ. I was a dad. I was that baby's father. And now… Maybe I'm not. Uno, you are the father. Uno... Uno, wait. - Uno... - You wanna know what's worse? I chose to love you too. And you made me want something I never thought I could have. Family… And love. I love you. Do you really love me? Or do you just need me for your baby? I love you because I love you. Whether we have a baby or not. How about me? Do you love me whether we have a baby or not? I'm leaving. When I get back, I want you gone. Group hug? Miss CJ! Are you coming back? I will miss you. I will miss you too. - You look after... - Mr. Daddy? Yes. Take care of him, okay? It hurts because… You didn't come to us first. And you went to someone else. I don't want to lie to you every day. Instead of letting your fear and shame take over, you should trust your family, dear. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, I really am. Dad. CJ, it's already 2016. Parents don't disown kids for what they've done anymore. Let's make things clear. We don't approve of the decisions you've made. But parents forgive and accept their children. It doesn't matter what they've done. Not because that's what people these days are doing, but because it's right. And because they love their children. We love you so much, dear. And I hope you show the same love to your baby. Yes, Dad. Sorry, Dad. Hey! Uno! I can hear your phone! I know you're there! Open the door. 62 missed calls. You've been gone for two days. The airline keeps calling but you won't answer. Alcohol won't solve your problem. If you want to fix this, talk to CJ. Your issue's with the kid. You know the solution. Get a paternity test. Isn't that what you wanted? Why don't you do it? No. That's the only way to know if you're the father. Or if I'm not the father. I don't know if I could go through that again. I don't know how many times I can lose that baby. Okay. Okay, that's done. But don't you want to be a pilot anymore? I don't care anymore. What? Well, you have to! What's wrong with you? You've worked so hard for this. Like I said, I don't care. - I understand... - No, you don't. You'll understand once you've lost your family. You'll understand if you lose a child. If all that happens, then you can say you understand. If you can't fix yourself, maybe it's better you're not the father. So how long do you think it'll take? - Maybe 2-3 weeks. - Three weeks? Thank you. Hey. Thanks for doing this for me. I really appreciate it. Don't thank me. I did this for my child. Hello! Hey! Your room is so dark. You're like a vampire. Much better. Are you okay? Are you sick? Have you taken a bath? Not yet! Have you eaten? You should eat or else you'll get skinny. You won't be handsome anymore. Open up! It's right there! Open wide! Come on, baby daddy! Very good! Hello? Is Captain A bus a do there? Yes. Are you his daughter? I'm not his daughter. Who is this? I'm just his friend. Who are you? "Deliveration" meeting? Okay. He'll be right there. Bye. Why'd you say I was going? They said they need you at the "debileration." What's that? That's where I'll know if I can be a pilot. Then you need to go there. You can do it. Captain A bus a do? We've reviewed your training records and your attendance. Your grades are good, except for one S-. But we called you here because of a bigger issue, your recent unexplained absences. As you may very well know, we can suspend you and take you out of the program because of this. Also, it's going to take you another two years before you can apply for captaincy again. Do you understand? However, upon the recommendation of our. Director of Flight Operations, Captain Gatchalian… The board has decided to… Allow you to stay on the program. However, if this or any such violation of this gravity happens again, your bid for captaincy will not be subject to deliberation anymore. Instead, you will be automatically… Captain Gatchalian. Captain A bus a do. Thank you. It's the least I can do for you. And don't thank me. Thank your friend. He told me about your situation. He told me about you. Everything you've been through. Things I should've known about. Hi, Dad! Come on, Dad! Let's go! - Just a minute. - Okay, Dad. I was just his age. Sorry? I was only 15 when you were born. I was just a kid. I wasn't ready to be your father. To be anyone's father. But still, I wish… I could've done something to make sure… …that someone would love and take care of you. But… I needed to forget you… So that I could move on. So I could forgive myself. So… Now, I'm asking for your forgiveness. I'm sorry, Uno. I'm so sorry. For 32 years, we weren't a part of each other's lives. Maybe it's about time we changed that. Maybe we could be… Friends? Thank you. Thank you. You know, you would have been a great dad to that baby. What makes you say that? You chose to be that baby's father. You chose to love him. And you can still choose to do that. Daddy! Yay! Hi! Miss Manalo. DNA TEST RESULT CJ! Your papers have been approved! You'll be assigned to the ticketing office until you give birth. Take it easy. The baby. Thank you! See you tomorrow. - Bye. - Bye. - Where are you? - I'm outside. We're on our way. I thought you were going to pick me up? Yes. We're near. - So, where are you? - We're coming. Okay, hurry. I have good news! - Okay, sure. - Okay. See you! - Goodbye! - Bye! Hmm! Oh! Are you following me? CJ, I'm getting married. Congratulations. Congrats to you too. You're going to be an A bus a do. You're really something. I haven't even said yes. Wait. Don't you want to say yes? CJ… Why won't you...? Okay, if you really don't want to, then don't smile. Manalo… I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't realize it sooner. But now, whether or not I'm the father of that baby, I'll accept it. I'm sorry too. For all the heartache. Here's the paternity test. It's not important anymore. What's more important now is the choice I'm making today. And I'm choosing you. The both of you. Manalo… I almost got you there. Don't you really want to? What a waste. I prepared an airplane for you. Wow! That's grand. Where are we going? Say yes first. Woo me first! Come on, CJ... Hi. CJ, right? - Yeah. - Uno. Oh, hi. Oh my god, you're so beautiful. Where have you been all my life? Hi. Oh my god, you have such gentle hands. I have a gentle heart. You wanna have it? Sure. Is this the part where we kiss? I think so. We should do it slowly.
