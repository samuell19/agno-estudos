This film is inspired by the life of Lucio Urtubia. Some names have been changed and some events and characters have been altered or created for dramatic purposes. "Robbing a bank is a crime, but founding one is even more so." PARIS AIRPORT Good luck in there. ENTRANCE Hello, my name is Lucio Urtubia. Shit, shit! - What's wrong? - I think you got ratted on. I what? The police are outside. Do you have the money? Yes. Oh, shit. Have you seen this man? It's Inspector Costello. Where are you? - There! - We've been spotted. - That son of a bitch. - He won't get away again. Stop! What do we do? What's the plan? You! Stop! I think you're mistaken. A MAN OF ACTION 20 YEARS EARLIER Stop, thief! Oh! You little bastard! Lucio! Lucio! Papa. I can't take it anymore, son. It hurts so much, you have no idea. Lucio, do you understand what I'm asking you to do? Listen, my son, you're the only one that can do this. The only one that has the balls to do what I need. Oh, God! BANK Hey, Urtubia. How's your father? He better at all? Soon he'll be dead. Oh, dear boy. That's life. We'll all have our moment too. Tonight, I'll pray. We don't need more prayers right now, sir. We need money to buy him some morphine, so he won't suffer. You know we'd love to assist you, like I told your mother, it's impossible. We can't provide money without a guarantee. You've got plenty of cash here. But 5,000 to buy morphine's too much? This is a bank, okay? This isn't a charity. I'll work the harvest during the summer. You'll get every cent we owe. My father's in so much pain. Please help him. Sorry, Urtubia, but the promise of a child isn't sufficient. Especially the son of a republican. Urtubia... Just go home now, okay kid? Take me with you, Satur. Lucio, no matter what, you can't leave until you've served in the military. Yeah, but I need to leave. - I'll go to Paris with you. - Yeah, but it's not a vacation. - I have to work now. As a maid. - So then maybe I'll work. Staying here makes us all remain poor, so we'll never be free. Do your military service, and when you get out of there, please come see me. Okay? 10 YEARS LATER - Saturnina! - Lucio? Wow, look at you! We used some buckets to smuggle the stuff out of the place. Blankets, boots too. We grabbed tools... Plenty to steal in the military. We'd cover everything with food scraps, and we smuggled it with garbage bags. - You have crazy ideas. - I like crazy ideas. These ideas make trouble for you. End up leaving that army with peanuts to go and fight for Logroño. Screw everyone there. Someone ratted us out anyway. So the police got my team locked away in military prison. - But I managed to escape. - Go back to them, please. No way! They don't like deserters. I'd be imprisoned, I might be killed. You could go there and fix things. No, I'll never go there again. I hate the military. I hate orders and singing "Cara al Sol" all day. Darling, it's me. Hello. Patrick, this is my brother, Lucio. Lucio, this is my husband, Patrick. Pleased to meet you. He makes the prints at the Mint now. - Think the Mint would hire me? - Uh... You have to be a qualified specialist to work there, you know. But I have a buddy. He works as a foreman. Can we trust him? - What'd he ask? - If you're trustworthy. Yeah, very trustworthy. - He's my brother. - Alright, well I'll speak to my buddy. Okay, hey kid. You're making us look bad. The days are very long. Why don't you slow down a bit? But a slow pace just makes me tired. Well at least take a lighter load then. Understand? What, are you deaf? No, I hear fine, do you? Alright, listen. There's rules in this place. Created by the people here the longest. Germinal is the oldest one here. You all can do what you want, I'll do the same, alright? Republicans, socialists, progressives, Stalinists, Trotskyists, anarcho-syndicalists... We couldn't band together at all. We never stood a chance of winning that war. I remember when we had that big fight with the PC. To see who'd keep all that stuff we took. - Those munitions we grabbed in Mieres! - That's great. I had many ties to the Catalan Progressives, the Independent Syndicalists and their party after, and finally, in the Esquerra. And you? What're you? - Hm? - What are you? Don't know. You must be something. Well, communist, I suppose. Communist, he says. - You don't like getting ordered, right? - Hm. You're an anarchist. Anarchist? And what's that? CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY OF THE CLICHY ANARCHIST ASSOCIATION - Time to work! - Go ahead. I'll be there. Here, comrade. Thank you. Let's hit it. Look, Lucio. This is Bakunin. Along with Proudhon and Kropotkin, he formed the basic ideas of anarchism. No religion, no state. Liberty, then work and collectivism. Here in France, there are some big names like Louise Michel. She was the key revolutionary in the Paris Commune. She said, "Power is evil and tyrannical." "That's why I'm an anarchist." Saturday 30th! Constituent assembly of the Clichy Anarchist Association! Sébastien Faure. His mission was to create a society of men who were free and equal, without government or money. Money is one of the greatest evils of humanity, Lucio. Desire for wealth corrupts the world. - Next Saturday! - Hello, sir. What is this? - Good day. - Is this yours? Buenaventura Durruti. He robbed banks. Banks exploit their workers and cause inequality in the world. Durruti said direct action would be the only way to end injustice and have a revolution. Men aren't like him today. Well, there is one now. My buddy, Quico Sabaté. He stole 50,000 pesetas out of a bank in Barcelona. - Nothing. - Nothing? Lucio. If you deny authority and fight against it, you're an anarchist. - Give me the paper. - It's nothing. I think you're right. I'm an anarchist now. More anarchist than all these guys together. Go away! You don't have to beat us! Ah. - Is it bad? - Nah, too hard for those bastards. Look out! Chill out! I've driven since I was a kid. Eh? Someone tell me what those assholes said. Lucio, if you want to stay in Paris, you might wanna speak their language. LANGUAGE SCHOOL MODERN LANGUAGES How are you, Lucio? - How was your French lesson? - What? Oh, nothing. Will you do me a huge favor? Yeah, of course, I'll do anything. Tell me what you need. Do you have food for him? The man is starving. It's upstairs, in the attic. Here. Take the suitcase. You go first. - You live alone? - Yeah, of course. Never trust a stranger, kiddo. I need somewhere to stash these weapons. Holy shit. Who are you? It's Quico, Quico Sabaté. - You're Quico? - You? Lucio Urtubia. Have any food, Lucio? Like bread, or some sausage, or cheese. Anything would be great. Yeah, of course. I have sausage from my village. Hm. Perfect, kiddo. It smells good. You didn't have a lot to work with, so this is all I could do. You aren't one of those guys who thinks cooking is just for women, huh? Huh? Don't know. If you choose to live your life always moving, then it could be a good skill. Hm? Did you get 50,000 in pinched pesetas in a bank in Barcelona? Well, not everything you read can be trusted. Only got 30,000 bucks. Those assholes always cry and say I grabbed double the amount so they get extra out of the insurance. The same happened to me too. Oh, yeah? Took two pesetas out the box in church, priest says I took five. They're all bastards. Priests along with bankers, same breed of bastard. Robbing you even when you're trying to rob them. Those sons of bitches. I like you. Like me, you're a man of action. Eh, kiddo? Time will tell. Listen. I won't make you do this, you have a choice. No, I want to, but... Just I'm feeling nervous a bit. Yeah, that's normal. Everybody is first time, my friend. Just don't let your fear paralyze you. Understand? - I've robbed banks before, though. - Guess it didn't go well. A few years ago, I tried robbing... Tried robbing our village bank. Why's that? My father, he needed the money, so... What happened? It went very bad. Yeah... Listen, kiddo... You and I will be inside that bank soon. We are more than robbers. We ensure money's expropriated. And we'll make it out in honor of your father. How does that sound? Come on. Your mask. How do you say, "Everybody get down"? Uh... Tout le monde al sol. I think that's it. Tout le monde al sol. COUNTER 2 Motherfuckers. Tout le monde al sol, damn it! Put the money inside here now. Hurry up! Put it in now! Stop fucking around. Put your hands up. Get 'em up! COUNTER 1 CASHIER Hurry up! Never forget who the real thieves are here. Yeah? See the counter? Go there. Hurry up! Hurry up! Faster, get fucking moving! The money! Come on! Come on, come on, come on, come on! Give it now! Move! Move! Come on, let's go! Sure you want to do that? Go on, go, go, go! Hey slow down. Slow and steady. Just relax. Keep moving. Over there. What do we do? Hop on the metro? No, we can splurge a bit. Let's take a taxi. Kiddo, we're eating fried squid and onions tonight. Amazing work needs celebration. It made me feel like my heart could just explode. - I just can't be robbing banks, no... - Why not? You were stupendous! Listen. Alright, jumping around isn't great, and when you open doors, act normal. We have the money, what now? My method, divide it into three parts. The first part is for the movement and local anarchists. The second part is for our friends in prison and their families. And the third part... belongs to the ones who did the work. - Belongs to us? - Well, of course. It's money to buy our food, to help pay the rent for this place too. And to buy a car. Because escaping in taxis, not ideal. - Don't happen to drive, do you? - No. I guess we should find a driver. Hello. Sir, you can't park there. Really? I'm sorry, I didn't know. I'll only be a minute. Go, go, go, go! Come on, come on, come on! Go, go! We're in, we're in! Let's go! Watch out! Go, go! - You all fine? - Yeah! Come on, let's go! Mother... - Getting closer! - It's the fastest I can be. - What are you doing? - What do you think? Don't hurt anyone! Calm down. Inspector Costello, there's been a bank robbery in the sixth district. Witnesses say they had a foreign accent. Give him that. Share it around the neighborhood, okay? That's how we make lives better. Alright, Asturiano. Sir, there were two, apparently with a Spanish accent and calling it an appropriation. Spanish anarchists. Could you identify them? No. They had stockings over their faces. But I think I could recognize their voices. Don't worry. I think I know how to find them. In response to comrade Michel, all of us, the exiled Spanish workers, will be responsible for sharing our doctrine to all of you, our French comrades. The revolution is not a utopia. The revolution is not a utopia. The revolution is a future that is still possible for us. That's well said. Speaking for the French, we want good jobs now, and security. No revolutions and no class wars. The class war is more pertinent than ever. The rich are getting richer. The poor are getting poorer. Do you understand her? Mm-hm. People's mentality can change. This planet is in need of a new order, politically and socially. No. What we need is to establish new theoretical principles. We really need to quit chatting and begin doing it. If we want justice and equality, we have to fight for it. - That's what we'll do. - Well said, Lucio! What does that mean? Police! Here come the police! Police! Quick, we have to go! Lucio, come with me! "This is an expropriation. Everybody on the floor." Next. "This is an expropriation. Everybody on the floor." Next. "This is an expropriation. Everybody on the floor." Louder. "This is an expropriation. Everybody on the floor." It's him. At least, I think it is. Take it off. Tell me your name. Lucio Urtubia. Listen, Urtubia. This is your first incident. So you should confess and give us what you stole right now. The judge will be nice too. So you'll get two years at most. My palms may help. Covered in plaster and paint. Nothing more than a simple builder. I don't know banks, don't know robberies. Inspector! There's something here! What's in there? The cash? Your weapons? Just some magazines with naked girls in them. Besides the Eiffel Tower, Miss Bardot is the best monument in France, right? That's funny. Perfect, I'll be honest with you. I know you're my man. Sooner or later, pal... You can bet I always get my man. - Hello. - Hello, Lucio. Spoken with Quico? We hid the weapons and he moved on. Navarro, come here. Here. Look. All that's because of you. Germinal, if banks are robbing all of us then... Then we must steal back what they took. - Jesus, you trying to be Quico, now? - Is that bad? What's the big deal? Quico is a fugitive. He's got no house, no family, and no future. You really want that? He's not wrong, kid. If we keep robbing these banks, we'll end up in a jail cell or riddled with bullets. Care for a bite, kiddo? These guys have already lit the spark. They're showing us the way. Yeah, Quico, but it's not Cuba. It's not possible to take power like that. That method requires a lot of weapons we don't have. Yeah, but our plan is to expropriate banks, what if we rob a factory of munitions? Let's say you bring us weapons. Who'll be firing them? Germinal says revolution is only possible if we spread the word and get the people as a part of our cause too. To make allies, we need a printing press, not more weapons. Now Germinal's turning you into printers? Well, it's not robbing a bank, yeah, but still a form of action. Yeah, sure... - I'm going over to the lion's den, Lucio. - If you go to Spain, they'll murder you. I would rather die fighting fascists than live making no difference putting out flyers. And you're better than that too, so you should do the same. You and I are no different, Lucio. No, Quico. That's no path for me. Well then, kiddo. I'm sad it seems this is goodbye for now. Here, keep this. - Quico, not your switchblade. - Now it's yours, keep it man. Take it. - Come on. - Fucker. It feels like you've been a father to me. I'm a father? Not that old, am I? An older brother, maybe. Or even maybe a cousin from your village with the sausages. A cousin. - Give me that. - Here, please. We just need a loan of 10,000 francs to buy a printing press. I'm very sorry, but... you have no fixed income, and no property. So, it's impossible. Sir, we're honest workers and our word is sacred. We promise we'll pay back the 10,000 francs in five years. I'm sorry, but we won't put our trust in people's word, only in their finances. Understand? - Behave. - Fucking banks. So you're going into banks unarmed now, huh? It's Christmas. I'm sure you have a lot more things to do. It's good to see friends at Christmas. What is this? I've spent weeks being followed, can't you see I'm a simple builder? An informant that we have has said that you've decided to start printing propaganda. And tell me, what else did your informant say? That the robberies have stopped. Not so brave then, without your buddy Sabaté. You're not as tough as I thought. Know who that is? Quico Sabaté. Oh, I guess you haven't read today's newspapers yet. Honestly, it really is a shame. Because you would look good in a jail cell. Rotting in La Santé. But, that's life. Oh, and enjoy the holiday, my friend. QUICO SABATÉ SHOT DEAD BY POLICE DEMISE OF A BANDIT For Quico. For Quico. Everybody on the floor! Is that your money or the bank's? - I just took it out. It's mine. - Keep it then. You! Please don't shoot. Take what you want. It's an expropriation. - Let's go! - Let's go! 9,900. Here you go, your 10,000 francs, sir. Thank you. Madame. What's your name? Jeanette. But everyone calls me Petite Jeanne. Have you been working here long? Since I was 14, so this is all I know. Your boss says you can speak Spanish. Well, yeah. My mother lived in Cuenca. We need a person that can work all these machines, that we can trust. Well, I know everything you need to print. Trustworthy too. Are you sure? Well who'd you vote for then to be president last? Bah! I didn't vote at all, I don't trust politicians. Hey! I can't believe you're so stupid. We needed a print shop and now we have it. Fine. I'll make sure the place will be handled by the union, alright? No way I'm giving this to a union. This place is mine, I decide what to do. Who the hell do you think you are, kid? An anarchist. I don't take orders or answer to anyone. I learned that from you. You're leaving me then, boy? Eh? - Asturiano, come on. - Meet you later. God damn you both. You will face consequences. Let's go, Josep. Do you really think Germinal ratted on you? Just trust me, I'm sure he's the one. Hello! - Morning, madam. - Morning! - Do you have our pamphlets? - Yes, they're there. - Thank you. - You're welcome. If you want to be useful, join us. The more, the merrier. It's important. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. UNIVERSITY STRIKE NANTERRE UNIVERSITY BEAUTY IS IN THE STREET WE WILL GO ALL THE WAY Please leave the campus immediately, or we'll be forced to remove you! LONG LIVE CRITICAL THINKING NANTERRE UNITED The bourgeois revolution was legislative, the working class revolution was economic, and ours must be a social and cultural revolution. Because we want a society where men and women are equal, where men and women are free. Show us your tits! Get lost! Shut up! Enough. Our political system is run by a caste that doesn't represent us and so, we, the young, with our conviction and ability to mobilize, can change the system. We can change the world! Come on, baby, get your tits out! If you interrupt her again, I'll smash your face in. Got it? Get out of here! Beat it! - Was it okay? - Yes, it was great! - There are so many people. - I'm glad. Ah! - Thanks for shutting that idiot up. - It was my duty as a responsible citizen. - Are you Spanish? - Yes. What gave me away? A bit too old to be at university, so... Yeah, well... Well, I read this. Felt like an invitation. - I gave you that? - Yeah, at the printer. Did you forget? I gave 'em out to so many, but it's amazing that you came out. Don't know. Thought it was important. And it is. Truly. - Can I ask you something now? - Sure. - Do you like following orders? - Not that much, no. Seeing people just get more poor and the rich get richer? Well, no. Leave the campus immediately, or we will remove you! And priests and politicians imposing their ideas? I suppose I don't. Well, then I think you're one of us. What do you think of joining our group of anarchists, huh? Uh, what? We need women with your mindset. That are idealistic and intelligent. And are brave. Run! Watch out! Come on, let's get out of here! Those little fuckers. It's always in the same spot too. So you and authority really aren't buddies then? By the way, who are you? I don't even know your name yet. My name is Lucio Urtubia. Just a builder. An anarchist. And... And? - Do you really want to know? - Of course. I'm not afraid of it. I steal from banks too. - A big fan of Lupin, huh? - Hey, listen, I'm being serious. I don't play around, I don't compromise too. Everything we make from bank heists helps the people and the cause. - Wait, this isn't a joke? - No, I mean it. It's your turn. Tell me your name now. Okay, it's Anne. I study Biology and want to improve the world. Mm. This may be the best apartment I've seen, but uh... It must be a bunch of money as a student. My parents' money helps. Dad has a business. So you're petite bourgeois. One who tries to convince her rich father to collectivize his company and to make it better for his workers. What does he say? That the police aren't brutal enough to us yet. - Don't tell me you don't dance. - Ah... I'm good here. Come on. - Come on, just move a little. - No, I can't. Sure you can, just move with me. You just gotta move. Big shot tough guy anarchist, but women are a total mystery, huh? The Spaniard has fallen in love. Now he makes love, not war. Inspector. - Commissioner. - So, Costello... I hope you've got news. He's fallen in love. Great. Paris spends heavily on fighting crime, and my chief inspector has been sitting on his ass for weeks, costing me a fortune, being a voyeur. Boss, believe me, they'll make a move soon, I'm sure... Doing what? Kissing on the Champs Élysées? Boss... I bet you anything he'll return to action. I've told you many times. Without evidence, there's no case. So get off your asses and go take care of the hundreds of real cases piling up in my office. The tension between the United States and Cuba is rising. The building of missile launching ramps on the island has forced Kennedy to carry out a naval blockade. This government, as promised, has maintained the closest surveillance... The president of the US has announced they will take immediate measures... The Americans are trying to put down Castro and his revolution. There has to be something we can do. Cuba's a bit far for us to go. We can be printing out leaflets denouncing it. Uh-uh, no. Pamphlets aren't enough for this fight. So what can be done then? You know that you can print other things here, more useful things. Do more than our leaflets can. For example, you can print documents too. And even fake passports too. HIGH-QUALITY WORK What's new, Patrick? Oh, just looking for new work. Twenty people, it's so terrible to fire you so randomly. Yeah... Can't believe it either. How about I offer you a job now? What type of job? A job that can only be done with an expert fabricator of bills like you. Don't tell me you want to forge francs now. Francs? Of course not. We'll forge dollars. Are you two mad? You'd have to be complete fools. We've made a plan. No, there's no way. That's crazy. If my wife found me out, that'd be it. Listen, Patrick. Ah... My sister won't be in on this. And a little extra money earned every week isn't so bad.

CUBAN EMBASSY IN PARIS Ambassador, these bills are as powerful as a nuclear bomb. If we make millions of bills like these, flood the world with fake dollars, the banks in America collapse, right? Their money reduces to nothing. Speak to Castro. Impossible. All our communications are getting monitored. Look... In a few weeks, Che is taking a trip to the Soviet Union, and he's passing by Paris. That's perfect. Then I can tell him my plan. Hello, my name is Lucio Urtubia. The ambassador is waiting for you. Lucio, get in here. You have just five minutes, so don't push back. Show all your material, then share your plan. Say thank you for making time, then just get out. You got that? Oh! Don't make trouble, okay? No arguing in there. Don't be afraid. A little nervous my head'll blank on me. He's in there. - Here? - Yes, in there. Please head in. I guess you're the dollar man. Yes. Today, I can speak for a group of revolutionaries, who want change. Comandante, our plan with your help might be able to end capitalism. - We have the perfect plan to do it. - With dollars? Fake ones. These bills can be our newest weapon of war. They're almost perfect. Only an expert could tell that they are fake. Listen, Comandante. If we produce more millions and then make the planet deal with the fakes, the banks in America will collapse. Their money will be worthless. They'd be ruined, right? Maybe our time to end capitalism will finally be upon this world. Yeah. What do you do for work? Just a builder. But I have my good ideas. A builder... Your plan is a good one, Gallego. But, well the United States of America is much too powerful. Much too rich to destroy them with fake dollars. - Yes, but what if we... - My friend... A flea can't be expected to kill elephants. Motherfucker. - What's wrong? - I think you got ratted on. Oh, shit. It's Inspector Costello, - We got spotted. - That big son of a bitch! What do we do? What's the plan? Money! I think you're mistaken. Costello calling all units. Urtubia escaped. Keep an eye on all exits. - There! - Where? There! I told you. All agents, Urtubia is outside. Arrest him immediately. He's by the taxi ranks and he's wearing sunglasses! Go! Ah. What did I tell you? Urtubia, you can bet I always get my man. Don't worry. The first day's the worst one. But you'll get used to it all soon enough, trust me. Yeah, it's disgusting, but you'll be accustomed to it very soon, don't worry. No! Urtubia, stop! Stop that right now! - Charlie! Is it bad? - No. Fuck you and your mother! You're a lifesaver, Gallego. - Come on, go to the infirmary. - Yeah. - What's that about, huh? - Nothing. Sold fake checks to guys from Marseille. Huge mistake. The plan was perfect too. Yeah, mine too, man. What a perfect plan, huh? Yeah, I guess jail is full of these plans perfectly done that fell apart like ours. Lucio, this is Thierry. He'll represent you. - You'll be out of here very soon. - Is the team out? They said they didn't know about it all. The judge decided to let them out on bail for now too. Just like they did with Anne. They haven't made a decision about you yet, but look, you don't have a record, so I think the judge should be letting you out on bail quickly as well. Nothing to worry about. You'll see. Oh, by the way, I named her Juliette. So she's a girl? Yes. You have to get me out soon. It won't be that bad. In a week, you'll be walking free. Shit, Anne's had the kid already. Lucio, please, don't do anything stupid. You're about to get out of here. You sound like my lawyer. I've spent months here. Well, just relax. Urtubia. You've been granted conditional release. Go on! Go meet your little girl! 8 YEARS LATER Payment. What the fuck is this thing? Where's the money? You're holding it. You can exchange that for money at any bank in the world. They're called traveler's checks. So you hand over this paper and you get cash in return? Yes. And it works in shops. This is the future. I'd prefer bills to this. That's what you're getting this week, Lucio. Take it or leave it. - This is bullshit. - Yeah. - See you. - See you. - Is that a cat? - Yes. Are you sure? It looks more like a giraffe. Oh look, there's Dad. - How are my girls? - Perfect! - Do you know what? - What? I scored a nine in mathematics class! Oh, well that comes with a big prize. A religieuse! Thanks, Dad! Okay, come on. That's 23.30 francs, please. I only have ten, miss. Can I pay the rest in a few days? You know, the banks don't let you breathe. I'm sorry, sir. You can only take what you pay for. But you can pay with this. - With this? - Of course, you just have to sign here. Okay. What are they called? They're brand-new traveler checks. This paper is used at any bank on the planet. Even supermarkets too. Hand this paper to the banker, and they give cash to you. What an invention! We don't need to go in with guns now. It's the future. Listen, Lucio. Don't go messing with the banks in America, it's... - A big risk for us. - Of course it's a big risk. - All our best plans are, though. - Come on, Patrick. The last place I'd like us to go is to prison. I hate that place. But come on, we're anarchists. We must resist the bourgeois. The banks, the police, the courts, they make the workers stay in their place. They oppress us every chance they have. But we can fuck them back, it's our duty to. Especially a fucking bank! Our duty to! These checks are much easier to create fakes for than those passports and the documents for ID cards. But they're more difficult than forging dollars. I checked and the prison punishment for forging checks is minimal. Since it's owned privately, not long in prison. But why City Bank? If you're robbing a big bank, then why not pick the biggest bank too? And cashing these is a piece of pie too. Come on, Patrick. Give us a hand with the plates for printing. Then you're out. The rest, I promise we can do. Just make sure my wife doesn't find out. Let's make it happen, my friends, alright?

Yes! ♪ Let me see what I've been missing Yeah, all right ♪ What are you up to, Lucio? You haven't been home for the last few nights. We said we'd be more careful. You know the police are still watching us closely. If they put us both in jail, who will take care of Juliette? Look, these are the last passports I'm doing. It's over. You should stop all this too, Lucio. Morning, I'd like to cash these checks, please. EXCHANGE Is there a problem? No, I'm just checking to make sure the number doesn't match any stolen or lost checks. Mm-hm. Well, well, well? Alright, so each pair will have 20 checks, and we'll all go to different cities. Cash 'em quick. For this to work, we have to hit City Bank at exactly 12:00 in the afternoon. The more branches we can take on, the more damage we'll do to those bastards. Listen, this is very important. The operation must be at twelve o'clock all at once. That way they can check the serial numbers, which is written right here. You all see this? We have to be very careful. One of us goes in, and the other stays out front to watch for anything suspicious. This is going to be huge, a historic expropriation that will be an anarchist milestone. But this only works if we hit them together at the exact same time. When the checks arrive at their headquarters and they see they're false, we'll have already distributed the money to those who really need it. Your partner will be waiting for you so after you leave the branch, you both can help distribute the money. Or your partner will let others know if there's a problem. And if all goes well, repeat the plan the same way next month. FIRST DAY - LYON Well this part's the same as before. Three parts, yes? One part for the anarchist cause, then the second part for the prisoners' families, and the third part's for all of us. Do you think that share can also include a few bottles of wine to help us celebrate? Of course, Asturiano! Get us something good! BOLIVIA It's actually quite simple. Their system consists of buying real traveler's checks to copy the numbering. They then make 100 copies of each. Since they cash them in on the same day, at the same time, at different branches, it's impossible to detect the fraud until these checks arrive here a few days later. Now, this is from the latest batch. As you can see, they are a very high quality. - This is a massive-scale fraud. - And what are the French police doing? They say they're on it and they'll have some arrests made soon. But the checks keep coming. We will lose millions. Yes. This could be a disaster. Mr. Barrow, you will go to Paris to sort this out. I understand your concern, Mr. Barrow, but you can't expect us to put policemen at every branch. Trust us. Our investigations will bear fruit very soon. I don't know what, uh... methods you're using, but those forged checks, they keep coming in. We just need to gather enough evidence before making arrests. Evidence? More evidence than that? Now if this were a French bank, don't you think some arrests would have been made already? Are you accusing us of not doing our job properly, Mr. Barrow? No. Of course not. - We're all on the same side, aren't we? - That's what I thought. So, these advanced investigations, where do they lead? Tomorrow is Sophie's birthday. - Sophie? - Yes. - And do you want to go? - Yes, please. - What time is it at? - It's at 6:00. Commissioner, been a long time. Still just doing the daily grind? Still a builder. Done it for the last 20 years. These are very well-made bills, you know. Um... You know these? Like I told you, Commissioner. I don't do that now. And City Bank wants the man responsible. They want whoever did this in a jail cell. Daddy, are you going to jail? No, honey. He's just asking questions. Well look, Commissioner, these banks are the biggest thieves in the world. So yeah, I'm glad they're getting robbed now. Even better a bank in America. I wish they'd lose more. Sure, play the smart guy. Put a tail on him. And don't lose him this time, okay? So that's what you've been up to. You should think about Juliette. You should think of her too. If we want to make a better world for her, we have to keep fighting. - There are other forms of fighting. - Are there? What are they? Doctors of the World wanted me to join their project. It's a project in Bolivia. So it could be good for us. So... So, I'd help around the hospital, you'd build houses for everyone that needed one. So we'd still be fighting to change the world, right? It's not the time for this, Anne. This is our best shot yet. Lucio, the police can make so many dumb mistakes. Doesn't matter, it's no big deal. But if you go make one tiny error, then you'll be through. ...a massive fraud which affects the world's largest bank, First National City Bank. High-quality counterfeit traveler's checks are circulating throughout France. Some branches have stopped accepting them due to the heavy losses these fake checks are causing, creating customer dissatisfaction... You're trying to tell me that this bricklayer is the brains behind the whole operation. It would be easier if it was the usual gang of crooks. Those people are stupid, easy to catch. But Urtubia is extremely careful and distrustful. It's not easy to gather evidence against him. And how long do you think you'll take for you and your marvelous French team to catch this mastermind? A cellmate is like a brother. Yeah, six months straight, listening to his snoring, all the nasty farts, too... Not even his wife knows him as well as you do after that. Eh? Listen, I bet you if I asked Anne some questions about him, I might be able to answer better than she can. - She doesn't want to know. - You're right! - Anyone want anything else to drink? - Yeah! If we make an effort in education, the people respond. But the foundations have to be laid... Please, Lucio! I'd like to introduce you to Pierre. He's the director of the Parisian Doctors of the World. - Pleased to meet you. - It's a pleasure. He's traveling alongside the team on next month's journey to Bolivia. Yes, and I hope that we'll be in great company. I said we're still talking about it. Yeah, well it's just... Everything is complicated. Yes, I understand, but I hope that you can help us. We need experienced, skilled people that are committed as Anne, for example. Well, we'll see. - Are you going out again tonight? - Yes. I really need to respond soon. So are you coming with us or not? I have to know soon. - You've already made your decision. - I'd be crazy to pass on this opportunity. I won't make our daughter watch cops bring her father to a jail cell. Don't you understand, Anne? This makes a huge point to the biggest bank on the planet. No, you don't understand. No matter what amount of money you rob, you can't win. But this can prove that beating us isn't easy. You do what you want, but we're getting on that plane. With you or without. You do whatever the hell you want. Now... Now there are just more important things to be done. People are nervous, Lucio. Some branches only cash one check a day, others aren't cashing at all. They had to stop the flow sooner or later, you know. What's the plan for the rest though? Thirty thousand more checks to be sent out here. Come on, all that money, three million dollars here. What's your plan? Because one by one won't work. I agree, the risk for us all is too much. I wonder if it's our moment to retire this. What about you? Ah, fuck it. We need a way to sell it all at once. A single buyer, one last payday, right? One last stand, then we retire for good. We'll all be top dogs for once. Last blow is the best. Well? Tell me your thoughts. Alright then, all those in favor? Imagine what all this money could do for our cause, huh? Our compatriots in exile still need assistance. I'm in. Alright, how are you going to find someone to buy all these now? SECOND-HAND STORE - ÁLVAREZ CLOSED What's up, Charlie? Lucio, what are you doing here? Good to see you! Is this a social call or do you have pawning to do? Well, I need a bit of help now. I owe you big for saving my life, my friend. Please, tell me what you need. Our flight leaves Saturday at noon. You've still got time now. - Do you have the material? - We brought a sample, yeah. Perfect. Alright, Tony Greco's waiting over there. Please, come. It's incredible. It's perfect, wow. - May I offer you two a drink? - We don't partake on the job, so... Well yeah, you might not. Why don't you pour one for me? - Asturiano... - I don't know if Charlie told you two, but, well, I've been sympathetic to you all for a while. To the anarquistas españoles. And uh... Well my father was part of the International Brigade in his glory days. At my home, we had books on Durruti and Ascaso and Quico Sabaté. Sabaté was a buddy of ours. - Oh, really? - Mm-hm. It's really a shame there aren't more like you in the United States. There, we prefer our money over having any sort of ideals. And so about money, now... Well, you know I'm ready to buy all that you have if the price is reasonable. - So then tell us what price is reasonable? - One third of its value on market. Perfect. Get us one million dollars. There's three times that amount in these checks. Alright, I need a few days. Saturday's the latest we'll go. And not after 12:00. - You don't trust the guy? - I was taught to never trust a stranger. Go! Michel, give me change, please. What's going on? We'll all end up in prison because of you. The police are always watching our house, we can't escape their patrols. It's just always about your important revolution. Other people are at stake too! - But this is it, it'll be the last. - No! Just stop now. I'm sick of you getting in trouble. You can do what you want, but leave us be. No more plots, please. Patrick, come on, now. Anne. Now they're following all of us, you know. It's clear they know about this too. Only we know where it'll be, along with the American. The American could be the plan to get you. We did check him out and followed him. Seems fine to me, so... He is who he says. Seems the best thing is to stop right now. There may not be another opportunity! This deal makes money for so many who need it. Well then. Sorry, Lucio. But I can't live my life in a jail cell. No. Goodbye. I'm going to go to bed. Just leave it. - Don't make a mistake. - No, I have to. Or I'll just let them win then? Who'll win? The banks. The all-powerful. The system. If we don't beat the enemy, they'll be stronger. Just help me. Come on. We'll beat these guys. You and me, it'll be like old times. No, Lucio. It's over. It's too late now. Our flight leaves at noon. Trust me, time isn't an issue at all. To help ditch my tail, huh? One last time, yeah? Then our family boards that flight to Bolivia. Listen, the answer's no. Won't even give me a chance, you don't listen to a word I say. Now, here's your plane ticket. Up to you. Juliette will wake up soon and I need to finish packing all my stuff. Alright. I'll be there at the airport. Perfect. Good luck. What do you want? What are you doing? Relax, mon ami. Take a minute. No, you can't. Are you crazy? Asshole! Where were you? What happened? Hello, sir. What can I get you? A calvados, please. And for me, a café au lait and two croissants, with butter and jam. These rackets get me hungry. Good morning. Thank you, sir. Get in, sweetheart. Don't worry, you won't miss your plane. You'll be fine, okay? There he is. - I'll be back soon. - Okay. Don't move! On the ground! Excuse me, madam. It's finished, Urtubia. You gave it your best. This is it for you, pal. Come on, tell me then. Asturiano, Petite Jeanne, and the American are all in prison. The only one that's disappeared since is Patrick. No, not Patrick. I heard that he was gambling and owed too much money in debt. I guess they used that. I'd help pay if he told me he needed it. But after what he's done now, there's no... There's no words for that! Asturiano and Petite Jeanne got approved for bail, which is good. But your case though... That's more complicated. Barrow, the head of security at City Bank isn't playing around. They're pushing hard for a 20-year sentence now. He wants compensation for the fifty million bucks his bank lost thanks to the movement. So I'm really fucked, huh? Dear Lucio, I always knew you were an idealist. And a man of action. That was what made me fall in love with you. And I know the fight will always be the most important thing in your life. But times have changed. The revolution is a utopia that belongs in the past. We live in a different world now. The fight is different now. Here in Bolivia, we're getting to know another culture, other ways of helping people. We've found a new world. Juliette and I are fine. I think we can be happy here. I hope you get out of jail soon so you can come and visit us. Juliette misses you and, you know... I'll always love you, in one way or another. Juliette and Anne. Urtubia. You have a visitor. The judge wants all of the summary discussions to be over now. If she does, then you'll stay locked in prison until you get your court date, but if we get that pushed, she'll have to let you out on a conditional release. - Is that possible? - Well... Here's what I think... According to the evidence gathered and the statements collected, Lucio Urtubia is the leader of a ring that has counterfeited traveler's checks from First National City Bank and has funded anarchist groups. We ask Your Honor to close the committal proceedings and set a date for trial. The court agrees with the submissions and the closure of the trial brief for Lucio Urtubia. Has the accused anything to add? Yes, Your Honor. I call for a mistrial. Your Honor, we have found several errors in the proceedings of the case. As you can see in these documents, there are errors in the transcription of the names and details. We also have serious suspicions about parts of the chain of evidence. Since the pre-trial detention period expires on Monday, we're requesting that our client be released on bail, while the errors in the case are being corrected. Your Honor, this is a farce just to get the accused out of jail. I'm sorry, no parle français. These legal issues cannot be ignored. He's a clear flight risk, Your Honor. Silence! The law and presumption of innocence are in our favor. Yeah, your case is all over television now. They've turned you into a celebrity. Let us through, please. Excuse me. Mr. Urtubia, Mr. Urtubia, is it true that your... BUILDER ROBIN HOOD They say he is an idealist, fighting the establishment. He's a delinquent. We can't have him loose on the streets. And we definitely can't allow them to turn him into some kind of hero. The judge granted him bail. There's nothing I can do. Yes. Yes, there is. There's always something you can do. Arrest him. It doesn't matter what for. Invent it. Plant it. Use your imagination and send him back to jail. C'est la loi, M. Barrow. Huh? That's the law. The law. As long as Lucio Urtubia remains reachable, we can only wait for the scheduled trial to begin. And the judge will issue a sentence. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have work to do. You know, you sound just like those reporters. I bet you get a kick out of this guy robbing an American bank. THE IDEALIST WHO FIGHTS THE POWERS THAT BE IS RELEASED ON BAIL You! You son of a bitch! - Hey! Patrick's innocent! - Hey! Look, the City Bank guy talked to me, he offered to pay my debts, but I said no. After coming to you that night, we chose to book a train. We went home to Mom's. Okay. If it wasn't you, who was it then? Not sure, Lucio. Wasn't me, though. I would never turn against you. I'm hurt you thought I might have. Come in. Alright, Thierry. What's wrong? It was never going to work. Tony Greco's a police officer too. I knew it! That proves I didn't get betrayed. I should have paid more attention. Got me good. Charlie Álvarez, your buddy in jail, was in on it too. - Charlie? - Used him to get straight to you. Not possible. He wouldn't, I saved his life! The man got threatened with 20 years in jail if he didn't. So he took the 10,000 bucks and took a plane to Buenos Aires. Oh, that motherfucker! Now then. Your court date's been set for us. It's possible I don't go back? Lucio, it's impossible to get out of everything. Yeah, but just how much time, though? - Four to five years. - Four to five years? If you're lucky. Ten to twelve if the judge accepts all of your charges. Anne? The next bullet, you won't see it coming. It's time we spoke. Thought my guys were the ones spying on you. You're watching us. How'd you find me? Well, I have my sources. My friends, you know. Yeah. Let's talk. I'm getting threats, they're making phone calls. And more, I think they want to kill me. Why would you come to me? How long now have you known me? Twenty years? The best years of our lives, or so they say. And all this time now, we've always played clean, right? I would say I have played more cleanly, but, well... If you want me to tell you who's sending all of this to you, I can't tell you because I don't know. The last few years, you've made a lot of guys a bit angry. My head goes to either the secret service in Spain, you know, or the traffickers of weapons in Marseille... Alright, Costello, don't fuck around right now. Come on, it has to be tied with the Americans. I'm sorry, Urtubia. But I have to play by my rules, you know I do. Without evidence, my hands are tied. Goddamn it! Lucio! Twenty years in this game playing pure and then Yankees get involved... They believe they can do whatever they want. Well, they can't. Go teach them that. The police and the secret service are looking for him, so he'll be arrested within a matter of hours, with no possibility for bail. Mr. Barrow, solve this problem or you'll have to deal with the consequences! Yes, sir. You know what to do now. DE GAULLE'S SPIRIT IS STILL ALIVE You think this'll work? Better work, right? You're awake. So, did you sleep well? It's been a while since I got more than five hours of sleep. I'll make my leave soon too. I don't want to cause trouble for you. Please, it's no trouble for us. You saved my family when I was in prison. And we won't forget that. Well, thank you, but if this goes to plan, I'll soon be at peace for good. Whatever you need, Lucio. I'm with you. - Well, thank you. - Of course. What's up, buddy? You're making me nervous, kiddo. My dad told me that you used to rob from banks, right? And that you met and talked to Che. Is that true? This is out of control. Some of the checks have been found in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany. But one batch has just come in from Mexico. We're fucked! - Yes? - Anne. Lucio. So how are my girls? You both good? Yes, we're alright. Are you? What happened? Is it true that you escaped? Well, you know how I get stubborn taking any orders. I just miss you so much. What's your plan, Lucio? I'll fix this all soon. And once I do, I'll hop on the first flight there. To make a new life with you. But things have changed, you know that. Is that Dad? Let me talk to him. Here's Juliette. - Dad? - Hi, honey. How are you? Fine, everything is good! And you? How have you been? Me? Just working, as usual. A phone booth in Lafayette Square. Did your aunt tell you that? She also says that you're crazy and you'll get yourself killed. Don't listen to your aunt. She's the crazy one. Well, honey, I have to go, okay? Dad! Promise me you won't get killed. Yeah, I promise. And that you'll come and visit. Yes, I promise I'll be there. Love you so much. Love you too. Tell your mother that I just miss her so much. You can tell her yourself when you get here. Yeah, I guess so. I'll tell her soon. Goodbye, Dad. Goodbye. - I'm unarmed! - On the ground! - I'm unarmed! - On the ground! Finally, this nightmare comes to an end. I can't wait to get back to New York and eat a real burger. You know what I mean, Costello? - Well, he gave himself up. - Oh, he didn't have a choice. He wants to talk to you. Huh? I'm Lucio, Lucio Urtubia. Yeah. Oh, I won't be offering my hand to a criminal. Okay, Dios! You're the real criminals here. All you do is corrupt the people and the planet with all your money and your wars. Your speech over yet? I hate all this anarchist stuff. My only goal here is to be sure the company gets an unbiased trial for you. I have a deal to offer you. I'm sorry, but City Bank doesn't negotiate. As it would seem like a weakness and make a bad precedent too. Well, I think you'll want to hear what I have to offer. Everyone thinks we should be very tough on you as an example. That is non-negotiable. But all my forged checks will keep going and appear around the world. You've got me, but you don't have the plates that I print on. So the printing will never end for you. We'll just go on making our forged checks. Very soon you'll be changing your mind when your plates are found with the rest of your band. You're right. At the moment, your bank is at the mercy of all of us. We'll take a lot. Listen, Barrow, getting the sentence you want doesn't solve any problems. Good point, let's make a deal now. If you give me the plates that you print on, we may then accept a minor trimming to your jail time. I'll propose another deal. I'll give you all the plates, I'll give my promise that no bad traveler's checks will show up in your fancy office again. And in return, you'll get rid of all the charges, and... Give me a nice, modest compensation for any inconvenience caused. What? What? Are you out of your mind? City Bank will never accept that kind of blackmail. Who do you think you're talking to? Please think about it. Traveler's checks are your business' future. And here in France, many of the banks chose to stop taking them because of all the false ones that are appearing too. I guess it all depends on how you'd all like to appear too. - What are you saying? - If we forge checks, City Bank will have to stop selling checks to stop throwing away a lot more money. I guess that's a public admission we beat you all too though. Imagine what City Bank's image would look like after that. Not to mention your bosses, who'll all see that you're unable to find a good solution, so... Might think you're incompetent, so you'll be fired. Accept my offer and the problems at your bank will be over soon. Just trust me now. This deal is best for us all. So? Come in. And don't worry, everything's in order. Well, sorry, but my friends would say to suspect everyone. Especially a bank, so... In about 20 minutes, I have a check-in with my friends too. You really have a strange custom of painting us to seem like we're the real criminals. There's the amount we said. Here you go. You're not being duped. There are no fake ones. And these are the final batch of forged checks that we made. Can I be positive of that fact though? Well, I'll keep my promise. Just by your word? What's your alternative? Look, there he is. So? - Come on. - Well? What happened? This time, the flea just beat the elephant for once. Ironic, isn't it? A simple bricklayer defeated the most powerful bank in the world. We just saved our entire business for nothing more than a tip. Didn't anyone ever tell you, Costello? The house always wins. SPAIN 82 Hey, how are my girls? Daddy! Ah! You're really here! Yeah, of course, honey! Family always comes first. You grew up so fast, you're so pretty! You really did it. You always say I'm so stubborn, right? I think you're gonna miss it. No, because the fight goes on. BANK - No, you can't be serious. - No, no. You know, I just think that this place is in need of a hand. We can tile the facade, walls need painting too, I think. That's a good start. Sounds good. Come on. No one knows how much money Lucio demanded from City Bank for the anarchist cause. Whenever we asked, he just answered, "A lot." Shortly after Urtubia's action, big banks started to look for alternatives to checks. In the mid 1980s, cards and ATMs were taking their place. Lucio was a bricklayer and anarchist his whole life. He published two books, The Revolution on the Roof and My Lived Utopia. Lucio and Anne separated but remained good friends for life. Lucio died on July 18th, 2020 becoming an idol for new anarchist and libertarian generations.
