Studying on a Friday night. Because I'm hardcore like that. Fragile masculinity is adorable. Like a teacup pig. May I remind my opponents of the distinction between anonymous and synonymous speak... Uh... Hey man, are you all right? You see the moment he realizes he's lost everything and will never walk free of humiliation again. Hope he brought a change. Crying emoji, crying emoji. In light of recent events, I am taking a social media hiatus to focus on my studies. Can everyone please leave? Get out! Masculinity so fragile, you assert meaningless dominance over public space. Hey. Do you mind using headphones? Please. Oh, God! Are you okay? Sorry, man. There's this hilarious video of this guy shitting his pants at the debate tournament. Yeah. He looks really familiar and I just wanted to check. Oh, where're you going? May I? Thank you very much. Did you watch it? No. It's not worth anyone's time. I think we're actually here early. It's my worst nightmare. Excuse me. This is quiet study? My name is Patrick, but most people call me "Pohprah." It's a mixture between Puff Daddy and Oprah. Hey, I know I knew you from somewhere. Nice try, buddy, but after the day I've had, you're not even making a dent. I just need my... Has anyone seen my phone? I need my phone. Have you guys seen my phone? Pohprah, do you think they're doing, like, a scavenger hunt or something? Read a fucking book. It's Nabila, right? I'm Dan. Are you having a panic attack? I'm fine. Shitty night for me too. Literally. I'm a meme, now. Pants-shitting debate Republican. That video has been up for, like, 10 hours. No escape. But, you know... Thanks for the reminder. You know, it's weird to me that you know who I am. Sorry. You know, if it's any consolation, total strangers know my name now, too. But neither of us can sue for defamation unless we can prove actual malice, which is not easy. All because we're public figures now, arguably. Because of this stupid stuff. Great. So, why did you? Oh. I, uh... Might have been drunk, but don't tell anyone. Are you good? I'm fine. It just takes me a minute to... I don't do so well around crowds anymore. I feel ya. Oh, my God. This is so annoying. Oh, my God. Hey! Stop! I'm in here. Hey! Stop! Stop! Help! Dan won't get a memorial because there was no mass shooting or manifesto or anything... - That guys was messed up. - I went to the... This is really sad. "Dead body on campus, open call for deductions." I should have gone to an urban campus. It's been a while but it still hasn't... Structural violence and complicity inside the social media panopticon. Why you shouldn't share that photo. If you haven't been finger banged in the Mick-Or-Mack parking lot, were you ever really a freshman here? I'm trying a new highlighter because I want to look like an alien princess but also a pure prism of light. Do I still have to take a test? I'm planning a great black out for the football game. I hope it gets approved. I feel really bad for making fun of that guy. Okay, seriously, do I still have to go to class? I knew Dan. He was a nice, quiet kid. It's a shame. My class got interrupted by a real, actual death. Everyone used to stand here... I wonder which one is the rookie loose cannon and which one is the veteran cop, a month away from retirement. All that matters is that we get results here. So, we all got an email saying the meet-up location for the annual retreat had been changed to Library Adjunct B103. So this is the Gay Men's Chorus Retreat? We thought so, but we walked in and it was chock-full of randos. Rando. Rando. Rando. Look, there's me. Who took this? You just want my help, I'm not being detained, nothing looks suspicious unless I blow you off and go back to class. I took a picture, I didn't stab anybody to death. You don't feel a little bad? I don't feel bad. In general. I deleted Tinder after all the... It's my first day and I already want to transfer. My mom almost took me out of school because of that guy who got killed, it was on Yahoo. Did you know Dan? Did you see the picture of the body? Sounds like the worst porn ever. It's creepy. This ends with someone's head in a box. Good morning. I was thinking you'd cancel. You know, with everything. I always try to make my students a priority. Well, I mean, I would've been okay if you had canceled. I know you're skeptical of these meetings but I like to think they help. How are you feeling? Compared to when? Compared to eight months ago. Well, technically, I'm worse than when the piece first ran, because I didn't realize I had ruined my life yet. But I'm definitely better than after that. When, um... When the basketball team got suspended from the tournament after your article? Yeah. Are you still living at home? Yeah, I'm getting to that. I was doing better. That is, until I found a dead body on Friday. I am deeply sorry that happened to you. The photo disturbed me. Deeply. Has everyone seen it now? I could say I'm just keeping tabs on the things my students are interested in, but I'd be lying. And after a week like this, it is hard to be off Twitter. I'm off Twitter. Well. Your grades are good. No incidents. I haven't had a death threat on your behalf in... A while. So, I want to say our school-mandated check-ins can end. Clean bill of health. What about my transfer? Well, the schools you are looking at are competitive. Especially if you want to move to another journalism program. So, aim lower. Or prove you can hit the target. Admission officers love a good comeback narrative. Yeah. We really didn't talk about Friday. My door is always open. Thanks, but I don't really think I'm gonna trip over any more corpses on my way out. Famous last words, right? Dean Flores? Excuse me, Dean Flores? I have Channel 4 and Channel 6 about the death, and a Detective Gray wanting to speak with you about a Shelton Bruni? Shelton? Uh, we better do the detectives first. Vote Allie Kosko. Allie tries harder. Have they even heard of kerning? No. No one has but you. It was definitely worth it to get all of these reprinted. Your trusted emissary returns with ideas. It's strategy time. What do you have for me? You're a maniac and you should be ashamed of yourself. It's disrespectful to the victim, his family, and to this school to circulate a photo of his body. Does this seem genuine, or like I'm trying to be genuine in a calculated way to get more votes? Yeah. Wait, which does it sound like? Piggybacking on a violent crime for attention should also be a crime. I only see five retweets of your latest Vote For Allie Kosko. So I totes get where this is coming from. Being a bottom-feeding sociopath doesn't automatically make you good at politics. Neither does having a face your rich asshole husband is so going to cheat on. Don't care. Would smash. Secretary Clinton is an icon, I'm flattered. BTW, the opportunist here is the guy who posted a pic of a dead person for likes. Fist. Fire Emoji, fire Emoji, hundred Emoji. Mouse emoji. Three-prayer-hands Emoji. Everyone, click on her. Hey. Oh. Uh... Hi. Eric. From the murder. So, you actually found him, right? What was that like? Traumatizing. Even for me. I was on your side the whole time. Sports fans suck. My takeaway was that people suck. Well, hey. Have you been on Twitter? I don't have a Twitter anymore. Thousands of hate-filled racist misogynists after me last year. So I, uh... I actually threw my computer and phone into the sea. I mean, that's kind of awesome. Here. This is what I get for being hardcore. Nice. But to answer your question, yes, I did see the gore porn. I TA a class on coding, so I'm always in the MARB on the computers. If you want to stare over a consensual shoulder. Maybe. I have been learning how useless our public school computers are. Mine are state-of-the-art public school computers. Only five years behind. That sounds too good for a T9 girl. Shrill chiding at someone who is good at social media makes you sound bitter that no one's paying attention to you. Actually, my dad is a police officer, and he says that... Oh, good, deflect and derail a woman's salient points. That's 101 shit, my dude. Like, 5% of the student body... "Shrill, chiding, bitter"? We're one "hysterical" away from sexism bingo. Hey, if you're almost done, I gotta start setting up for tonight's show. Hang on. Did I miss something, or did someone blow a dog whistle for uptight bitches? I'm dying. I'm dead. Skull emoji. Exercise is critical for toning and feeling your best. But if you're interested in weight loss, you need to focus on what you eat. One thing I do is take a photo of every single thing I put in my body and post it. That way I'll feel too ashamed to eat pizza. Good morning. Um, hi. Are you following me? Um... Actually, you're the one following me. Uh, on Twitter. You follow me on Twitter. I saw your tweet that you'd be here. I didn't think I'd, uh... I didn't think I'd see you again, but here we are. Yeah. I just wanted to ask you if... Okay, stop. Ask what? Ask if you'd get drinks with me. That's it? Yeah. I wanted to ask you the old-fashioned way. Oh. Well, maybe. I'm pretty busy. Calling women "uptight bitches"? You've finally out-pigged yourself. Straight women of campus, stay far away from this man. Pig emoji. Straight men of campus... You know what? Never mind. Y'all are safe. Can I borrow your computer? Sorry, AppleCare doesn't cover being thrown into the ocean by a crazy lady. The Titanic plan cost too much. Don't be a jerk. Hey, I'm just playing it safe. I like taking care of my things. Please? It's Friday night, so you're probably looking to google yourself and cry. That's unhealthy. I don't want you to do that. For your information, I'm working on a project. It's not like I have to wonder what you're gonna do with your Friday night. I like myself. 243 retweets on the second tweet you did to Shelton this week. People are definitely into this drama. And they're moderately into you. You've created pockets who don't find you abrasive or... I'll care about whatever you're saying in just a second. I'm responding to three constituents who want to know what I'm running for. Well, you're getting a bunch of Follow Fridays. Those are kinda like votes, right? Straw polls. Telling other people to follow Allie's Twitter is at least an endorsement. Awareness of you is very high, but awareness of the student council election is not. Hey, who is this Vivian girl? Actually, it's hilarious that you would bring up Marx right now because... Okay, this is out of control. Literally everyone at the school is out of their mind. I wish that I had never said anything. Shelton is in a-hole. I don't identify as a feminist. I'm just not offended by a lot of stuff. Then you won't get mad at me for saying I want to turn you into a pretzel and lick the salt off. Great talk. Before this week I didn't think it was possible to suck the fun out of everything. Sorry. Wrong person. Hi. I think you have the wrong house. Well... Sorry. Have a good night. Sorry. Sometimes the only cure for politics is shots. You're really cute. What the hell is going on? You made it! Thank God. How did you know about this? The October party isn't until next week! James texted me. He got the e-vite. I send out house e-vites! Hey, idiot! Use the bigger knife. In the cabinet! Absolutely not! Ugh! That's nasty! Debra Flores, Dean of Student Relations. Yes, of course it's safe. Yes. I can help withdraw your daughter's enrollment. So, this time we're going to execute the same basic functions, but you'll notice this way is much quicker. Here we go. Dumb fight with socio Shelton about literally nothing that somehow lasts a whole week. "I think Allie is good student council." "Everyone, click on her." Completely neutral, but completely creepy. Twitter is fun. All she did was call out Shelton for being a ghoul. Then she gets everyone talking about her, which seems like exactly what she wanted. Then she gets all this spam, and then she gets killed. Maybe it was Zayn Malik. I want Zayn Malik to murder me. That doesn't mean anything. I want Zayn Malik to cut off my face and put it on his face as a moisturizing mask on his spa day. That is intimate. Yeah, definitely. Seems like they just didn't know. They were just following what the e-mail said. Or whatever, e-vite. didn't spring for the platinum network security package or whatever. You're writing a story? No. Maybe. This is just for me. Why did you flag me down? We were both there when Dan got killed. I like mysteries. I don't like violence. But sacred bond of witnessing a murder. Yeah, I don't have any friends either. So... What now? Hey. You don't remember me, do you? You're the girl from the thing. Assuming you mean the death of Dan Grimmer. Don't you think there was anything, I don't know, weird about that? What is this, Detective Club? Let's all just stay in our lane. Okay. I was just trying to help. Help who? Of course it was weird. A man was stabbed to death in the library by an unknown person. I'm just as traumatized as you but I don't have any special info. You're big on Twitter, though. I only have, like, 4,320 something followers. Okay. Look, I think that the two killings could be connected through Twitter. What? #murder? That sounds like something a 38-year-old marketing guy comes up with just before he gets fired. Okay, never mind. Sorry I bugged you. Student journalist claims basketball team received cash gifts, cars from alumni donors. Amid controversy, journalism student Nabila Nariman retracts story and resigns from position. It's funny because she clearly hates herself. It's actually not funny because she clearly hates fat people. FYI, it's definitely okay with me if you're not a stick. I'm not one of those guys. Sorry if I came off weird on Friday. Are you ready to push? Just a little bit harder. Let me hear you say, "Yes!" I have an extra large eggplant for Darby Bell-Santos. Wrong room. No breaks. I was told she'd be teaching in Studio C, Tuesday morning? Didn't order any pizza. Coming up on intervals! Can you just sign for it? It's already paid for. Stupid fitness instructors... I think my Zumba instructor was going through a break up or something today. Submerging my legs in ice. #intense. Take her class 9/11 A.M., Tuesdays, Thursdays, Studio C. #feeddarby Darby? I didn't... Daisy? Darly? Ace's pizza. Here you go. She has an anatomy lab in the Clyde at 10:00 on Fridays. Send Dominos. Is anyone checking her Wednesday schedule yet? Also, forget Dominos. #feeddarby, and save her from her miserable life. Can whoever is sending me pizzas please stop? It's not funny. If you follow me, you should know that I don't eat pizza. And this is really wasteful. #feeddarby. Says where I am at all times. People watched me come here. Yeah, look how many fans you have. Okay, that's not one. I am such a failure. I haven't even told my mom I relapsed. Have you considered not telling her? Hey! I have five pizzas here! Hey, people are trying to sleep! Mmm. Thanks for letting me hang out. I was hoping they wouldn't find me here. But I am straight up being stalked. Well, I'm only, like, 50% monster. And... You're amazing. Look, checking your phone all the time is giving you massive anxiety. Deactivate Twitter and go free. Okay. Okay. It's a good idea. If I'm not back for my phone by 11:00, send out a search party. Be careful on that fire escape. Um... I'm actually pretty athletic and agile. I tried to order myself a pizza last night... Anyone else think it's fucked up that someone's followers ordered unnecessary pizza... and he hung up on me. So, I'm sorry, Darby. Is Twitter broken? Because my whole feed is about some random girl who likes pizza. It's, like, a really sad story, except she might actually kill herself. The level of harassment is out of control. Hey, girl, call me ASAP. 540-555-6503. Super-urgent, concerned for your safety. I'm not crazy. Hope you're okay. Vivian Weiss. Ow! Oh, God. It's got to be up here somewhere. Well, at this rate, there's no way we're gonna be able to find it. I think this is a bust. That Google alert was a fake. We got taken in. Marshall, come here. Times up. Off your butt. Give it back. Where are you going? Mom asked me to go to the store. Hey. What? Do you want any snacks or anything? Just get those salty granola things. Yeah. Attention! If you get Follow Fridayed you will be their next victim. Do not engage with, or follow that account. Obviously. Where are you going? Nope. I won't keep you. I just want to know if this was you. How long did it take you to figure out my Twitter handle? Yeah. I'm a big old dork. But I'm wondering why you're trying to impede an ongoing police investigation? You mean, why did I warn people I don't know, because I wanted to broadcast a public safety announcement quickly and effectively. Sorry if you tried faxing it already. I have been on e-mail for 20 years, man. I figured it out by spending an hour on Twitter after three people had already died. The County Sheriff's department is treating Ms. Bell-Santos's death as an accident. Accidental impaling. We can't comment on the details of an ongoing police investigation. Well, clearly you're at least watching Twitter. Finally. We can't comment on the details of an ongoing police investigation. Okay. Well, I look forward to reading about an arrest in the morning paper that a filthy servant boy brings to me on one of those super-tall bicycles. And then, when I get back to this century, I'll continue to actually help people. Bye. I don't have an appointment. Have you ever had an appointment? Your shoe is untied. Dean Flores? Vivian Weiss? You surprised me. I am looking forward to Friday's announcement. It's a big step. I had a 2 o'clock. I had a 2 o'clock to go over your talking points for Friday. That's right. I'm sorry. I've had the Board of Trustees, the police, parents calling me. But I am trying to make students my priority. You're the reason I do this job. And this is important. Yes, Internet safety. Online harassment. Starting to sound like a contradiction in terms, huh? But, yes, I agree. It is a big step. Although murderous psychopaths probably aren't deterred by school rules. Yes, but only systems truly beget violence, and you're changing the system. I love your passion. I love that it hasn't been burnt out of you. E-mail me the talking points and I'll go over them for Friday. All that matters is that this school is the first one with an actual progressive policy against the online harassment and abuse of women. Thank you. Testing. Testing. This is Bob Woodward. So, when do we upgrade from person of interest? He'll do something dumb. Hey, I noticed in your write-up that you didn't define Follow Friday. You're going to have to fix that. Oh, Gray, do you need me to explain what Follow Friday is? It's like on Friday you say, "Follow Friday" and you post a bunch of accounts you want people to follow. Is there anything there? I'm checking. Blah, blah, blah. These kids are into some boring-ass shit. In my day, we did blow and crashed Trans Ams. Well, it got us out of the house. Do we know this? Oh, crap. Let's go. Don't do that. That's not funny. I am required to make a verbal statement regarding campus policy changes that affect the school. So here goes. In light of recent events, the administration has updated our Internet policies for the 21st century. I know that, to you, there is no barrier between online interaction and the real world, it is the real world. Ms. Weiss has been an invaluable ambassador between us old crypt keepers and you young people. An aging and out-of-touch establishment should defer to the youth vanguard on matters of justice. Let's unpack this. So, here I am... Hey, why do you follow so many students? So for instance... Oh. Okay, "Goody slore"? Really? Am I a goody goody or am I a bad slutty whore? Actually, you're a bitch. If by that you mean assertive, then, yes. This is the opposite of what we're trying to achieve here. Effective immediately... Man, people do not like this Vivian girl. I could have told you that without reading. Inappropriate behavior perpetrated by or against members of the student body will be... "Gunshots, armed suspect at large." "Students should gather in Glassman Auditorium." Wait, that's a horrible idea. Everyone, stay calm. This is a sign that our alert system is working, which is a good thing. We don't know what the situation is yet. I am locking down this building. Everyone, please sit on the floor and stay in this room. You all right? This is completely FUBAR. Come on, people! Is there a shooter or isn't there? If I'm getting massacred tonight, I kind of want to know. Twitter is failing us. It's time for some ocular recon. No! No! Wait a minute! I'll text you when it's safe, okay? I'm gonna go liaise with the university security to find out about this campus alert. Stay here. Yes. I want new photographs and a full work-up of that entire area. Put the camera away! Do not listen to her. Take the picture! Take another picture! Never fear, the feds are here. Presumably due to the incompetence of our municipal investigators. "Presumably due to the incompetence" "of our municipal investigators." Who made her like this? I don't judge people's coping mechanisms. So, tell me some hacker stuff. Okay. it gets copied by all these dummy accounts, like a swarm, right? They're just routing through a bunch of different countries, whatever. So, this guy knows what he's doing? I mean, he's a psychopath, but he's not an idiot. I wonder if the FBI are doing any better. They're doing worse. Look. The new task force is headquartered at a police station, to any specific location or computer. Look, hacking this serial killer is... I don't want to say impossible but... Okay, so what can you do? You mean, what can we do? We need to find out who it is in real life. You seem excited. Okay. Don't laugh at me. But I have this hobby. Look. In figure A, it's at the victim's feet, but in figure B, it's migrated to his left hand. So, what do you guys just do detective club from the comfort of your own chairs? No, you make it sound silly. No, we just analyze publicly available information, you know, news articles, press releases, crime scene investigation photos, we share our findings with law-enforcement if appropriate. So, what's your success rate, out of curiosity? Well, we provided intel that may have contributed to the arrest of a convenience store robber. The police were misidentifying his disguise as a Spiderman costume but it was Deadpool. Wow! And I am the moderator. I'm tough, but fair. What does that mean? I mean, I don't let my personal biases get in the way of my modding. No. I mean, what does it mean to be a moderator? Mainly, I just suspend people from the forum if they get all swear-y or threatening. There's always a bad apple. Wait, click on that one right there. "Shelton Bruni, lady killer or lady killer? "Shelton has been at or near the scene "of nearly every crime so far." "Submit supporting evidence in the comments." Do the feds have him as a suspect? Person of interest. This is pretty great stuff though, right? Unless you're Shelton. One time, I heard him say that being a straight man is a handicap. Guys that are too handsome, creep me out. It's like, what are you hiding? I bet he constantly talks up his pussy-eating game to intrigue you, and then he sucks at it. Or he doesn't do it until you've lived together for a year and pick out your stuff at IKEA. That is 100% serial killer behavior. Oh, my God. Crying Emoji. Total serial killer behavior. I find his pitchfork comments to be consistently off-base. Total serial killer behavior. Total serial killer behavior. I mean, a serial murderer is gonna be a white guy. Let's not forget the term "innocent until proven guilty." Yeah, dude, we aren't on a jury. Why don't you go "actually" some... Hey. Hey. Oh. Hey. Do you really think it's right to drag Shelton so much on Twitter? I mean, I know he sucks, but the FBI is on it and... There's no real need to break out the torches and pitchforks. I believe in grassroots movements over empowering the carceral state. I'm honestly surprised that you are willing to trust the government. Whatever. Look, I think the killer is selecting victims based on how popular they are on social media, how prominent they are, how many mentions they get from everybody. And if I'm right, that means you're endangering Shelton, and possibly yourself. If he doesn't like the attention, he can get off Twitter. But you know he does. Besides, they suspended the murder account after I spread the word. You sure you don't want a lawyer? I bet Dad wouldn't over-bill you. I'm confident you guys can figure it out. Great, so are we. You seemed pretty calm for someone whose girlfriend was recently impaled. She wasn't my girlfriend. Which one? Because we happen to know that you were sexually intimate with Miss Bell-Santos and Dean Flores within the last four weeks. And they say your generation is lazy. I have an active social life. So do a lot of people. Well, not a lot of people leave a trail of dead bodies in their wake. First female victim, Allie Kosko. Never touched her. Thought about it. That's reassuring. But you quarreled. We took some pot shots at each other on Twitter. I wanted likes. That's not real. Let's just cut to the chase, huh? Ah, silly me. To think that I wasn't under the surveillance of the police state. Save it. Look, I already told them. She left her phone at my house to go for a hike. She thought she was coming back. So did I. So either the first thing she did that morning was text you nude photos of herself from eight months ago, or it's the first thing that you did when you took her phone. Continually harassing a private citizen for their sexual behavior, that's sexism in action. Except no one cares because Shelton Bruni happens to be a man. I want to fucking murder this Vivian chick. Hey guys, mod here. Friendly reminder, threats are not in the spirit of community crime solving. What's up? Nothing. My forum. Oh, your crime stoppers. How are your babies? They're good. They actually just found new suspects. Oh. I built you a program. Well, not just for me. But show me. All right. All right, it's thinking now. I made it draw from all the IP addresses and Wi-Fi networks in our geographical radius. And it's counting the number of mentions. And it's going to give us a name in, like, five seconds. Maybe longer. Allie's ambition literally burned. Sometimes a little too hot, like being too close to the sun. But I would give anything for her Virgo insanity one last time. Candles up front. Everything, even the most tragic, random... Hey, man. Be respectful. Hey! Aren't you a suspect in all four murders? Oh, look who it is. Just passing through, man. You reek of alcohol. I hope they've been giving you a hard time down at the station. This isn't even mine. Whatever. Everything comes back around. Everything happens for a reason. Hey! Stop! Stop! Someone help! Help! Help! Help! Oh, God. Well, you were right. Not right enough. I'm sorry it took too long to work. Look at this shit. They're claiming the murder. It's a new account, if that's the same guy, he's trying to let us know that he's not going anywhere. I thought you said the build wasn't that complicated. Look, you're right. The build wasn't that hard once I got it going. I just... I like spending time with you. You're so much better than I am. I felt there had to be an excuse for it. Okay... I'm not really sure how to process... No. Wait, come back. God. Stay back. I have a tip. I mean, I have information. I want to help. All right, Detective Anthony is our community task force liaison for press, family members, conspiracy theorists, prank callers. Just direct all your comments to him, please. That's me. Give me a call if you think you know anything. Okay. Hey! Sorry I'm late. Hope you didn't miss class or anything? I just thought you should know that every single person that's gotten killed has been popular on Twitter. I mean, not like Kim K, just relative to who they are. With hugely, exponentially more numbers of mentions leading up to the murders. I mean, even Dean Flores trended in the area for a minute before she died. Everybody was Follow Fridayed by that account, but first they got talked about by us. Well, I assure you that are interdart... Our interdepartmental task force is doing everything we can. My friend made this program. It predicted Shelton's death. Everybody had been all over him at the time because they thought he did it. It was too late but it works. It gave Shelton's name this morning. You goin' this way? So I don't think that there's a connection between the victims or that the murderer is selecting people like the Green River Killer. I think that they're waiting for Twitter to select people. That would be some new perversion. I'll tell the team, but I'm warning you about Marks, she's old-school. We're pursuing all leads but I don't blame her. It's tough to come out here and get respect from the good ol' boys as a... As a lead investigator. You have my card. Send me the thing. So, for the next series you're just going to swap the variables. Oh, is Eric teaching today? No, I'm covering for him. Are you... Okay, well. Eric? Hey, I'm sorry about this morning. You just surprised me. We can talk about it. I do need you to call me back pretty ASAP. Mama, I know, listen. Why are you suddenly upset with both of my children living at home? I lived at home when I got married and so did you. Darius is finding his path. Nabila, she's back in school. And at least she goes out of the house a little now. No, I don't know what's wrong with her... Got you something. I was going to wrap it. Thanks. Just don't go chucking it into the sea this time. Am I ever going to live that down? Absolutely. Not. It's too good. Why would the FBI release any photos with more viscera? See, here's one of my all-time favorite crime scenes. I like it because you can see the intestines. Scroll down for the close-up. It's sexist to assume that a female is not a serial killer. Just because there aren't female serial killers. The blood countess Elizabeth Bathory much? Owned, LOL. That lesbian chick Charlize Theron played in Monster. Owned, part two. I mean, they've all seen it. Vivian sucks. She's a fun vampire. I just feel sorry for the girls who act up because they aren't hot. I don't know what you're talking about, dude. Vivian is a solid seven. The quote-unquote official investigation is going nowhere. We're supposed to believe the FBI aren't just bumbling around as usual. If we get any further, I feel no obligation at all to share our findings with law-enforcement. Community policing is a citizen's obligation. That should include punishment for criminals. This is getting a little out of hand. Where's our mod? The mod's a pussy. Thank you. The mod is like, 12. Well, I think we're on our way to solving this one. I'd say call the police, but LOL. If you give the task force our good intel, they'll trade it for magic beans on their way into town. Literally, always wanted to swat Vivian. Violating someone's privacy is an infraction, worthy of public punishment. We have the power to send a SWAT team to her front door. 911, what's your emergency? Uh-huh. Can you repeat that, please? I'm saying someone is going to make a 911 call about a mass killing or a mass shooter, possibly something about a bomb or something that would trigger a rapid response, tonight. And they're lying and you shouldn't listen to them. Yes, I'll hold. Fuck you, whore. Blocked. You're a seven out of 10. I'm a nine. Blocked. You guys just... Go, go, go, go, go. Drop the phone, now! Hands where I can see them! Hey! What's going on? Officer? I'm sorry, ma'am. False alarm. It happens all the time. I read that if you make a mistake in public, you can't apologize in private. I figured out pretty quickly that if you make a mistake in public, you can't apologize. You can't even disappear. But I'll try one more time, for luck. I'm sorry. I screwed a lot of people over with my dumb-ass article. I was wrong, but it got me a platform. I'm using that platform now to remind you all that the killer is still out there, and they're picking people off for being popular on Twitter. We all know it. We all have nothing better to do. And we are all endangering our peers. Log off. Oh, good, I missed this delusional crybaby. I'm getting the popcorn. - Fool me once, shame on you. - Fool me twice, shame on me. I don't think I need to listen to a literal terrorist... My boyfriend at the time was on the basketball team and actually... Stop everything you're doing right now and look at this. "Sew yourself into a sturdy sack made of burlap "along with the rest of your litter "and roll yourselves into the Caspian Sea." "Unless you're too lazy." I'm not sure how I'm supposed to react to that. Okay, now look at this. This is an @ that I got, like, eight months ago. It's the exact same. Down to the misspellings. And it happened, like, a bunch more times this morning, all from egg accounts. Actually, it happened 79 times in 22 minutes, to be exact. I'm being swarmed. It's a robot. Isn't this the sort of thing you're supposed to do with your new boyfriend? He's not my boyfriend. And can you... Would you just listen to what I'm talking about right here? Okay. So the killer is a robot? No! Well, probably not. They're using a robot to select the victims. It's not organic. So someone is either copy-and-pasting really old stuff and posting it really, really fast, or it's just automated Internet hate. They can do that. Yeah. I know you're excited, but like, you're getting Followed Fridayed, right? Oh, I definitely am. But it's not Friday yet. Twelve, midnight, right? Then I get stabbed. Can you just, like, tell Mom that I'm going to be at a friend's house tonight? Huh? Eric. Uh... Erica Stone. And... Tree... Saw. Theresa Flannagan. Can you just tell her I'll be back next week, okay? Bye. I said I had a crime to confess. Aren't you going to try to get it out of me? Just tell me what you're doing here, ma'am. Will you promise not to kick me out? No. All right, fine. I have reason to believe that I'll be the next one targeted by the Twitter murderer, beginning tonight, and I would really like to sit this one out in a safe room until the killer's apprehended. So you're requesting protective custody. Yes, please, sir. People can't just walk in off the street and stay here whenever they want. I might die, sir. Even so, uh... I didn't hear a confession. What do you say we detain her until she plays ball? You're going to have to surrender your phone. Hate breaking that news to you kids. So, do I just wait here until somebody brings me to the jail cell? We're not going to put you in a jail cell, but, um, I can lock the door if you want. You're kidding me? What's going on? People are dead! Fuck you! Get off me! Detective Gray? I don't think we can keep you any longer. You were wrong. What happened? Posted shortly after you checked into our hotel. Now, we haven't checked the veracity of this video yet. Until we know where this was taken, we can't retrieve the body. Look closely. Does that room look familiar? If there is a body, like I said, it could be anything. Don't say "body." How well did you know the... Eric? This was their M.O. This is what they did to Shelton. They took a video. Focus. Eric and I were friends. He was helping me investigate. Why would you think that you would be next? Eric and I made this program to track the number of mentions people got on Twitter, to see how it lined up was Follow Fridaying. We thought they were connected. And then I got back online after Vivian got SWATed, and the people started mentioning me a lot, to harass me, to threaten me, I noticed that it was the exact same stuff that I had gotten a long time ago, it was like a robot was saying it. Then I figured I would be next because of all the mentions, so I came here. Oh, my God. The build wasn't that hard once I got it going. I have this hobby. Eric. From the murder. This account is run by Eric Cordon, who disappeared last night and is now at large. 2904 Colonial Tract Lane, Chickahominy, Virginia, 24016. Mom? Darius? Sorry, Dad. Ow! - What the fuck! - I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Ow! Did you come here to kill my family? Wait! No! No, I'm here to investigate! Investigate? What shit! You were on that bullshit chucklefuck detective forum for dipshit Raymond Chandler babies! Yes! Yes! Ow! I'm sorry. I don't know what I was thinking. I've been following the Follow Friday case, we all have. All the evidence is online and... Honestly, I was worried about you. We got out of control last time, so... I just saw the address and went. Well, maybe don't break into people's homes to check on them, when they're already expecting to be murdered. I think your mom left the door unlocked. You do realize that your moderator is probably the killer, right? That's new information. And that he's probably out there after me right now? Feel good about yourself now? Huh? What is going on? I knew your girls night sounded too good to be true. I have to go to the bathroom. Now is your chance to wrap it up in a bow or whatever you call it. I don't call it anything. Look, I think it was Eric the whole time. He's the one that made the program that tracked people's mentions on Twitter. Which is, essentially, what the killer was using to target his victims. He was logged into the account and everything. I think he faked his own death. Nobody was mentioning him at all and it completely broke pattern for him to be Follow Fridayed. So you claim. So, go down to the server room, room B5110. And you'll find all his shit. He's still logged into that account, the program he made is still running, and you'll probably find more stuff I don't even know about. I'll be here with all these firearms, behind these thick walls. So, where is Mr. Cordon now? How should I know? What? You want me to go out to a public place and tweet my location so he'll come confront me and possibly kill me while you guys just wait around in the wings to jump out and arrest him? Put together a team. Where are you going? Come sit back down with us. I just need some air. Eric. Eric, please just turn yourself in. If you really killed all those people or even if you didn't, they seem to think that you did. Um, don't call me back. Just come to the police station. I want to tell you that you're way, way crazier than I ever even thought. Give me my phone. You obviously can't have it right now. Get inside, we'll talk in there. Are you going to kill me? I said get inside! Get inside. Please, just don't hurt my family. Keep your voice down. Just get it over with. Nabila! Hey! Party? Hey! - Get down! - Get down! FBI! Everyone get down on the ground, now! Now! You told everyone that I was the killer but I'm not. You have to believe me. I don't. And even if I did, which I don't, I would have a lot of follow-up questions. 'Cause you show up here covered in blood, and pointing a gun at me after you kidnapped me and dragged me to the abandoned theater. I didn't do it, all right? I am not the killer. Well, you're making a terrible case for yourself. Put the gun down. Go, go, go, go, go, go. Okay. Nabila! Come here. Back here. Get down here. Come on. You really hurt me, you know? I reject you, romantically. So you kidnapped me, threaten me with a gun, and you expose me to a mass murderer. Even Steven. I'm not dead yet. Tell me what happened? I never told you that I was working to hack the killer's Twitter account. I didn't know if I could do it. But I'm a genius, so... I did it. Then I Follow Fridayed myself from the account, so the killer would think his program spit out my name and come kill me instead of you. I tried to figure out a way to spend a safe night in jail, but I didn't think to ask politely because even though I'm a genius, I'm apparently dumber than you. Fuck you, cops! It's okay. I tried to get them to put me in the drunk tank, but I didn't know who else was in there. The killer could be anywhere. Shut up for a second. Okay. Well, at that point, I had no more geniuses. So I got the dumb idea to fake my death and post it. I thought there was more than one murderer. We don't know. They're all anonymous. So you could be one of them. You could be all of them. What... That's some kind of cockamamie bullshit. Look. You had service in here this whole time? Three slain at Nebraska college in apparent Follow Friday killing. People are feeding off of this. It's bigger than one person. Maybe it always was. It's everywhere now. Or it's a copycat looking for attention in Nebraska. No, listen. Every time someone gets Follow Fridayed by one of these accounts, they hack some events so that a bunch of people show up somewhere, and no one can tell who killed the victim. What if it's different people? What, like murder franchisees? They decided to pick up the Follow Friday torch and do their part? That's not how murder works. Even for Charles Manson. Are you sure nobody followed you here? I don't know. Did you tell anyone we were up here? No! Come on. Come on. Come on. Let's go. Let's go. Oh, shit! Someone locked it. You used to work here, right? Is there a way out? I'm working on it. Go, go, go, go. Shit's going down at the theater. We urge everyone to avoid the area tonight. There's an armed suspect at large. Nabila? Eric! Oh, God! Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Eric. Oh, my God. Are you okay? Shh. Shh. It's okay. It's okay. I'll be right back, okay. Come and get me. Get down. Who is he? Do you know him? No idea. Ready to flee the country? You know, Mom is serious about moving this time. Just to another state. So, what, after all that, it was just some guy? Yeah, just some guy. They searched his shitty apartment, found computers, knives, manifestos, you know. The whole world was against him and he felt invisible, so he had to invisibly destroy a bunch of lives. There's nothing special or scary about the Internet, just the people on it. Hey, look. Please do not show me another phone right now. You've changed your Google results. What? You're in the news cycle as a plucky hero. Now use those wordy chops on a harrowing first-person essay to seal the deal and no one will remember you as the girl who single handedly sabotaged the NCAA tourney in college. All for the low, low cost of life-long PTSD. Just when you thought you were out. I would have gotten away with it, too, if it weren't for you meddling kids! I know that bitch did it. BRB, searching plucky student journalist porn right now. White guy gets shot by the cops, mainstream media cheers. Hashtag double standards. Hashtag Follow Friday.
