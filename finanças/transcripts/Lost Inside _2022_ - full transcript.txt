You know, we'll pick something easier next time, like a movie. But I... I... Please, I didn't mean... I... That went well. [Benji] Shut up, it was a start. You like her a lot, don't you? [Benji sighs] Yeah, well, she's pretty awesome. She's definitely an improvement. You've had a pretty crappy track record. Yup. Never really been one with the girls, have I? [Jordan] No, you have not. You know, my first girlfriend had to trick me into kissing her. [chuckles] Yeah, Amy. And don't forget about the fire starter in college. - Chloe? - And then there was Rachel. Who darted after I wasn't famous anymore. - [Benji sighs] - You have not had any luck in this department. No, the only luck I've ever really had was with my music, and... somehow I managed to fuck that up too. [chuckles sardonically] [Jordan] Hey, if you don't mind me asking, what happened with that? You remember Chloe but you don't remember what happened with my music? It might help to talk about it. I... Truthfully, I... I don't know. You know? I mean, one minute I'd written this song that I was physically in love with, you know, and then the next? The whole world was in love with it. I don't know, maybe... I wasn't ready to share it. - I don't think that's true. - I... [pensive piano instrumental] [chuckles] It all just happened so fast. And before I could even wrap my head around recording an album... you know, my face was everywhere. You know, cameras were following me. Executives were asking me for my next album. - Yeah, that sounds like a lot. - It was! You know? Like, I remember the moment I snapped. I was leaving after a show, and instead of my car, it was a mob of fans. And they were just pushing me and shoving and trying to touch me and reach their arms out for selfies and... [sighs] Something broke in me. I've never been so scared. [scoffs] I couldn't breathe. I passed out, next thing I know, I woke up in the hospital with this... irrational fucking anger. That anger never left. Any time I'd feel like that again, I would just lash out, become violent. And people thought I was fame-crazed. It was the exact opposite. And I don't know. My mind just shut down. - [Jordan] The freezing onstage. - Freezing on stage. Even if I wanted to come back from that, how could I? So... so naturally, I just locked myself up and threw away the fucking key. [sobs] [Jordan] I know, buddy. ♪ [music stops] Are we ever gonna talk about the fact that I look like Jordan Tyler? No. [sighs] What do you want me to say, okay? He's just some guy. [Jordan] He's obviously more than just some guy. I mean, so he was... He was good at life. I sucked at it, you know? So what? - [sighs] - So, jealousy. More like inadequacy. No. You know what? Fuck you. We're done talking about this, all right? [sighs] Just so we're clear. You sucked at living his life, not yours. You know, all this insightful bullshit's getting old, right? All right. Dump in that sugar. - You sure? - Yes, I'm sure. Are you kidding me? This is gonna be so good. - [Benji] Like that? - [Sylvia] Yeah. I made this recipe up. Dude, you're getting better at this game now. - I know, right? - Just kidding. - Oh, fuck man. - Fuck you, dude. - No. - Dude. Fuck you, fuck you.

Please. Want another beer? [Sylvia] No, I'm still working on my first. Are you sure you're okay? You seem really tense. [sighs] First time out of the apartment. Yeah, but you're just across the hall. I mean, my apartment's almost identical to yours. Unfortunately, that's not how my brain sees it. Well, not to encourage more drunkenness but what about a game of drowning fruit snacks? What's bothering you? It's, uh, it's my mom. I thought your mom was dead. She is, um, [clears throat] it's just that, uh... I, uh... I have her ashes on my coffee table. Oh, I was wondering what that was. [sighs] Bit of a long story. Uh, short version. [sentimental piano music playing] [sighs] I missed her funeral because I wouldn't leave the house. My father informed me that her final request was that her ashes be scattered at our old summer home. But that would mean leaving the house. - [snaps fingers] Right. - Right. How long have you had the ashes? Three years. So what's different now? An annoying little voice in my head that's pressuring me into doing it. - I could do it for you. - I'm just not ready. So what are you gonna do? Feel guilty. Hey, I thought it was my turn. You weren't going. You forfeited your turn. So are we ever going to talk about why you're a shut in? [clears throat] That's, um... That's not really something I care to talk about. Obviously. [Benji clears his throat] Well... would it help if I, um, if I told you that I know you're Tucker Stills? How? Wasn't that hard. I have the Internet. When? When did you know? Not right away. Um, I kind of got my first hint when I heard the Tucker Stills song - that you put on that play list. - [Benji whispers] Bastard. And it sounded so much like you. Not just the voice, but the words. So a couple of weeks in, I guess. So I take it, then, you read about the, uh... The photographer. Yeah. - About the Chinese restaurant. - [Sylvia] Oh, yeah. You think I'm psycho, don't you? No. I... I didn't know what to believe at first, you know, 'cause the... the violent, fame-crazed man they were describing just did not jive with the man that I know. The gentle, quiet, funny man who's afraid of his own shadow. But then I read about the awards and I got it. I get why you closed yourself off from the world. They broke you. - Who broke me? - [Sylvia] Everyone. The press, the fans, the industry... the world. Wow. No one's ever put it like that before. You're right. They... they broke me. S... so why the fuck have I been blaming myself all this time? 'Cause the whole world blamed you. And it's kinda tough to argue with the whole world. Look, Benji, I'm not here to tell you what's right or wrong or who to blame or even how to heal. I can't possibly imagine what you've gone through. [whimpers] And we can take this as slow or as fast as you want. I just want you to know that even if you never leave the house again... - I'm here for you. - [Benji cries] You would never be happy with somebody who can't leave the house. But we don't have to be dating for... For me to be here for you, you know? We don't have to define anything. We can just take it day by day and see if we're friends, or support systems, or soul mates. Whatever it is, is fine with me. [Benji sobs] You know, I pay $200 a session. My therapist has never put anything that good. You should charge. [chuckles] [Jordan] Hey. Sorry about yesterday. - Nah, you were right. - Excuse me? Hey, don't get too excited, all right, buddy? But, uh, I think you're right, it is time. I don't even know... how to respond to that. You don't have to say anything, just help. What about Sylvia? We're cool. She's helping too. I don't...

No... - Sylvia has told me so much about you, but also, most importantly, I hope you guys don't mind, I did bring some friends. - They really wanna meet you. - [Sylvia] What?

But she was the one that got you to leave the house. There must be something good there. Jordan got me to leave the house. Jordan forced you to look at your life. Sylvia was the catalyst for you to leave. - You should talk to her. - Why? She may have a good reason for what she did. She may feel bad. She may actually love you. [scoffs] Well, let's focus on better thing. You're slowly rejoining the real world. You're even doing that songwriter showcase. I am very proud of you. [chuckles] Thanks.

Well, it's true, I was a fan of Tucker Stills... but now I'm a fan of Benji Williams. [chuckles] Okay, yeah, I heard that as it was coming out of my mouth. But seriously, that's... that's why I felt such a connection to the words in your music. It was so personal. And I really, really felt a connection to the music, a connection to you. It's just music. It's music that you wrote. [Benji sighs] Can we start again? You think you can ever forget Tucker Stills? - I can try. - [Benji chuckles] So what does that make us? Friends? Soul mates? How about support systems? So, uh... [thud] You're not really a bartender, are you? I book bands for the Fillmore. [Benji] Hmm. That's actually how we first met. Um, I didn't personally book you, I was doing marketing at the time but I was at your show. And I was working in the back. And as soon as you started playing, I just stopped what I was doing.
