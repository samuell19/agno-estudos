Hello. Can we hand these out here? Sure, go ahead. Thank you so much. Really, thank you. I wonder if you'd be interested? -About what? -An audition. You should try. - I know this director. - Really? Looks interesting. You want to try out for a part? Maybe I will. That's great! Mask? That's an unusual title. Would you like one? It's a great film. It'll blow you away. - I'm sold. - Great, thanks. I'm definitely up for this. That's great. Thanks. You'll fit right in. Please remember me. Okay, let's go. Thanks. See you at the audition. Auditions for newcomers are very rare. I need to show I can do it. How could I not? Me? Eiko? Me? I'll do it, I have to. They say they'll even take newcomers. It's a golden opportunity. Don't tell the others. This is for us only. - Not even Kiko? - No, that's just more competition. Eliminate all rivals, that's typical you! How about I ask the guys? They're not rivals. Okay, sure. But no other girls, okay? -Got it. -No, I'm serious. - Okay. - Promise me. What? Break this promise and we're screwed. Please God! Hey there Eiko, what's up? - What are you posting? - Nothing. - For the audition, right? - How do you know? Ami told me. Bitch. She promised me. So I'm applying, too. What? You, too? Let's post them together. I'll get the part. They've all applied? Of course. I might as well just give up now. But I... I'm not... I'm not giving up. Then fuck it! Me, too. God help me! "Life, prepare for the worst." Please attend our show. "Life, prepare for the worst." Thank you. Please come and see us. Excuse me. Can we put up posters in here? -Sure. -Thank you. Look! Come see our performance. I need to focus. So cute! The red looks good. How come Natsume looks better than me? Is it the make-up? But you're naturally beautiful. Check out Azuki's pose. Really? Do I look bad? Unfair! You're so much cuter. We all look good. We have to be a strong team. We need to make it tighter. Can't you see this dagger? Listen, girls. Sorry, look. Ladies, do you know who I am? The female boss of the Portside Gang. Cheeky buggers! Will you be my girl? You gotta be kidding me. Don't push us. Isn't she? We were the top girls gang in town. You got that? Do you get it? Isn't this lovely? Where did Machiko find it? She forgot these, too. - What is it? - It's so cool. Did she make them herself? How about we try out for these roles? This is director Kobayashi's latest film! The deadline is near. "Send a photo and a written essay," "detailing why you want to appear in the film." "No email applications accepted." No email? In this day and age? Yeah, so backward. It sucks. To be honest, I love Kobayashi's work. Is that right? So now what? Are you in, Natsume? Shall we try? We'd be crazy not to! I'm the Boss of the All-Girls Gang! Do you know what this tattoo means? Joe Hello? Yes? Is Ayumi in your play? Yes. How are you two going? So-so, you know. She's my best friend. Enough with the "so-so" crap! Can I go there now? Here? Please. I'm really beat. You're my ex, okay? Stay away, go see Kurumi. She's not good when I'm like this. How convenient for you. Isn't it? Just this one time, just tonight. I'll bring your favorite cake. That German Baumkuchen? That's the one. "Can't you see my tattoo?" No, cut that out. Don't you want to see my naked back? Enough. Stop it. Come on, Natsume. You know what this is? You pushed me down. I forgot. Both Kurumi and I are auditioning for Kobayashi's new film. Did you know I'm working on that shoot? - I don't think Kurumi does. - But what if you get the part? You'll have no choice. You won't be able to take your eyes off us. The Red Post Box on Escher St. I did it! I'll be the female lead. - You? The heroine? - No, that's me. I'll be a co-star. And I'll be an extra! One day you'll know the real me. I'm the big, bad bitch! But I'm the biggest and worst bitch ever. I'll show you all. Can't you see this dagger? Listen, girls. Sorry, look ladies. Do you know who I am? The female boss of the Portside Gang. Cheeky buggers! Will you be my girl? You gotta be kidding me. Don't push us. We were the top girls gang at in town. Do you get it? You got that? Yes, great! Thanks. I'm in! They asked me to audition! Congratulations! It's only an audition so far. It's one step closer. Hello? Kurumi speaking. It's Fukumi. Yes, Hinako speaking. Yes, this is Natsume. How can we audition 50 people in one day? We have to. Kobayashi said the more, the better. And how many no-shows? They'll all come. Joe, I need your input. Later. I'm too busy. -Promise me. -Okay, sure. Excuse me. Hello? Kurumi? Where are you? At Natsume's place. Wanna come? You're at her place now? Come hang out, Joe. Joe? Haven't seen you for ages. Tomorrow, we'll be auditioning for Kobayashi's new film. Natsume and me. Me, too. Plus Azuki and Fukumi. -We all got selected. -It's a miracle! Great, enjoy that Baumkuchen and do your best. Eat Baumkuchen and do our best - okay. You have Baumkuchen here? Yeah, on the fridge. Natsume. Are you still seeing Joe? No way. Why ask? Look what I've got. Baumkuchen. What just happened? Street protests in Hong Kong are continuing. This is the 14th weekend demo in a row. - Sorry, road's closed. - No passage. But it's just there. - You'll have to go around. - Go on, bugger-off. That's Kobayashi there. We're so close. Hey! Director Kobayashi. Love your work! You're very popular. Here's the entrance. Can't you get here? It wasn't blocked earlier. Closed from 9am until 4pm. We can't get through. You can't cross? But you're so close. - They can't cross. - No way. - No, they can't. - No access for anyone! Hey. It's the quickest way in. Right, Natsume? I know how. You want to see something impossible? Watch! Why not? - What's with you guys? - Go around. Screw you! Bad luck. So hurry. Okay, next group, you're up. Thanks. Joe? You're Kobayashi's assistant? Yes. Awkward, isn't it? - Why not tell me? - Talk to you later. Just forget it. - You knew, Natsume? - Yeah, sure. Catch you later. I knew something wasn't right. Next group, can you move up? Next group but one, take their seats. Natsume just went in. - You're still practicing your lines? - Didn't you memorize them? Get off my case, I'm nervous enough already. Look at the crowds. Such a throng of humanity... So many that I forget my own face, my voice. Remember, I don't want to hear your excuses. We're already dissolving into the crowd. I will pull you back. You can do it. And how about this great body? Same as always. It's a test, act naturally, concentrate on your lines. I hope they notice I have a better posture. Who notices that? Can we have some quiet, please? Refrain from banter. Focus on the audition. So sorry. Excuse us. Mr Director, can we start? Okay, you're on. Start out with a self-introduction. I'm Natsume Ogawa. Ranko Kido. Asaka Mochimura. This is Koizumi, he's playing male lead for the auditions. Hi everyone. Let's start with scene 23. Natsume, you play Hako, Ranko as Kyoko. Asaka will be Sakako. Okay, on your feet. I'll play Hako. When you're ready. Okay, let's do it. Ready. Camera. Action! Look at the crowds. Such a throng of humanity. So many people, flocking to shop the malls. Faceless people, all wearing masks. Flowing like an unceasing tide. We all part of that crowd. You, too. I've forgotten my own face. I can't remember my voice. I don't even remember you. No, I don't want to hear your excuses. I'm starting to dissolve into the crowd. It's "I will..." "I will pull you back." I can pull you back. Leave me alone. Excuse me. "He's the man..." He's the man I love. Kyoko! Sakako! Where are you? Hako, what's wrong? Tell me. "Yusuke has disappeared." Yusuke has disappeared. You left him by himself? You idiot! Don't you get it? No, I do, but... What the hell were you thinking? This is terrible. Did you all hear that? What happened, Sakako? "Calm down." Calm down, Sakako. The world is going crazy! I love you. Cut. Okay, well done. Thank you. Please be seated. She was brilliant, wasn't she? Both of them. The camera loves her, too. Okay, Ms Natsume? Tell us about yourself. Well, you know... Well... You know... Too many "wells" and "you knows." Don't overthink it, just talk. Frankly, I'm a bitch. I'm a real, full-on, bitch. My sex drive is powerful and I have many casual affairs. I was a bad student, my parents gave up long ago. They can't count on me. Only my little brother believes that one day I'll be successful. Many times adults have told me that I'm no good. But when it comes to acting, I have total confidence in myself. I know that, in itself, is meaningless. Actually, today, I'm feeling quite nervous. Yes, that's an excuse. Thank you. What about you, Ranko? I am madly in love, obsessed with you. My heart belongs to director Kobayashi. And I love you just as much, Mr Kobayashi. Awesome! They beat me. We're members of the Kobayashi True Love Club. Kobayashi True Love Club. Let's go over the hill while whistling The sky is clear and blue Heading to the meadow Let's sing cheerfully Another blockbuster by cinematic genius Tadashi Kobayashi Let's sing cheerfully Holding hands with each other Meh-eh-eh says the goat Let's sing and walk in harmony Today is a funny day -Hello? -Hello? -Hello? -Hello?

Go the other way. Sorry. You guys are weird. Kobayashi, how about this girl? Yoshiko, from the last group? She's good, but not good enough. I fully agree. Talent aside, we want someone with distinct and unique characteristics. What about you? I just film what you ask me to. It's your decision. Can we start the next group? Okay, let's do it. All ready? Introduce yourselves one by one. Natsume Ogawa. Ranko Kido. Asaka Mochimura. Ready, start! Look at the crowds. Such a throng of humanity. So many people, flocking to shop the malls. Faceless people, all wearing masks. Flowing like an unceasing tide. We all part of that crowd. I've forgotten my own face. Thank you. Now sit down. She was brilliant, wasn't she? Both of them. The camera loves her, too. Ms Natsume. Please tell us about yourself. Well, you know... Well... you know... Too many "wells" and "you knows." I'm sorry. Thanks. Okay, Ms Ranko. Above everything else, I'm in love with you. I truly love you. My darling director Kobayashi. I adore you, too. We're members of the Kobayashi True Love Club (TLC). You two rock! Ms Ranko, tell us about yourself. When I first saw your film, it made me want to be in movies. I'd never appear in anyone else's film. Asaka, too. Another founding member of the Kobayashi TLC. We have other members, too. We watch your films each and every single day. That's all we do. I never imagined that one day I would actually meet you. I have never been happier in my entire life. Ranko has said it all and I fully agree. I'm Asaka, founding member of the Kobayashi TLC. I love you more than life itself. I'd die for you! Die, die! No, don't die. Look! I see a ghost. What? A ghost who's here for someone. She can see spirits. I'm so thrilled to be in your presence. Can we sing a theme song of your film? Let's sing it, Ranko. Okay, thank you. I love you guys. What about you, Natsume? Anything to add? Well, it's all good. Yes, everything's fine. It's all good. Okay, thank you. See yourselves out. Thank you. Thanks. It was good. Go for it, True Love Club! I'd love to film them. Natsume. Natsume. Next group, go inside. That's us. We'll talk later. Hello there. "Mask" A Tadashi Kobayashi Film Casting Call Kiriko, I think you're wrong. You should rethink this. I've already decided. You, too. Tell her to give up. -Listen, Kiriko. -Don't. I've already decided to take the audition. -But... -You, shut up. I know you loved your late husband. But Makoto is dead. You're not like him. He wanted to act, you never did. It's already decided. I'll follow in his footsteps. I admire your spirit and determination. The thing is, becoming an actress is not an easy thing to do. -I know. -If you do... I know it will be an uphill battle. But my mind's made up. And he'll watch over me. If he was watching, he'd stop you. No, he wouldn't. I know that he is smiling now. My dear, late husband. He'd say, if it's my choice, he'd fight alongside me. What if you fail the audition? That won't stop me. I'd become an extra. I'll keep auditioning. Someday I'll get a role. An extra, that's like being Passerby A, or B, right? That's a road to nowhere. I'll start as an extra, I'll do whatever it takes. Now you've really got me worried. Should we go, too? She's nervous, so we'll audition, too. What? Are you serious? We'll be with you, Kiriko. So give it your best shot. - Kobayashi? The film director? - Oh, yes. I'm auditioning for you. Really? Thank you. Someone's birthday? Yes, but not mine. My friend. Please wish them a happy birthday. Thanks. To be perfectly honest, I'd never seen any of your films. But yesterday I watched "The Demon's Neck." I'll lie my ass off at the audition. About how I'm your biggest fan. If Kiriko passes the audition, let's celebrate by finally getting married. That's long overdue. Makoto would've been so glad. Would he? -I'm home. -Hello, dear. Where were you? The convenience store. You didn't buy anything? Tomorrow! Kiriko? Kiriko, please. If this fails, I hope you'll give up. Not a chance, not her. Kiriko. Listen. Are we okay? Take it slowly. More slowly. Yes! Thank you so much. Thank you. That's wonderful! We got accepted for the audition. Really? Great! We did it. I'm so glad. Remember. Please remember. It's my face, not the crowd. Now I... I have my own face. Go to bed, dear. Please remember. Remember. Please remember. The road's closed today. You can't pass here. -No other choice? -Please? No, you can't. Go the other way. Come on guys, please? No means no. Give us a break! - No, can't do that. - It's forbidden. Through there's okay, right? No, work in progress. Too dangerous. Under construction. What are you doing? It's closed. You can't pass. We're running late. Who cares about your business? We could say the same. I'm just doing my job. And so are we! I'm sorry. It's the rule. What's with all these girls coming today? For an audition. A life-changing event. Then you must have this. It's for catching your dreams. Here. Kiriko, no, wait. Good luck. The best of luck. Go for it! Do your best! Next group, head inside, please. It doesn't suit you. Please come in. Tadashi Kobayashi Auditions Let's start with your names. Kurumi Yoshiki. Hinako Tanazawa. Kiriko Saki. Who's that in the back? I'm Masumi, Kiriko's mother. I'm with Masumi. My name is Ryuta. So, are you a family? Kiriko and I are mother and daughter. She and I are engaged. I'm Kiriko's father-in-law and stepfather-to-be. Kiriko married his son. I was a single mother. My husband disappeared when she was two. After Kiriko's husband died, we started dating. One year ago. One long, lonely year has passed. My late husband, Makoto, died in a car accident. That was a year ago. He wanted to be an actor. He was only 22 years old. I was working at a bank back then. Then, about six months after he died, I dreamt we were both on stage, acting together. It was a sad story. With a very sad ending. But I felt so very happy. It was a sign to follow his chosen path and become an actress. That's just your imagination. Mr Director, please set her straight. No, I support her decision. Seriously? Don't encourage her. Please. Her decision inspired you two to take up acting? Not at all. We're here to watch over her. A question. Can I become an actor? What's with you? What are you expecting? Ryuta, stop being silly. Please forget that. We're here just to watch over Kiriko. -She's right. -We wish her luck. We're just her chaperones. Okay Kiriko, shall we do it? Okay, run her through. Here we go. We have professional for you to audition against. Okay, start from scene 23. Each of you girls will be playing a part in this. Please stand up. Whenever you're ready. Let's go. Camera, action! Look at the crowds. Such a throng of humanity. So many people, flocking to shop the malls Faceless people, all wearing masks. Flowing like an unceasing tide. We all part of that crowd. You, too. I've forgotten my own face. I can't remember my voice. Remember. I don't want to hear your excuses. I'm already dissolving into the crowd. My face isn't a crowd. I have my own face. I will pull you back. Shut up! Cut! You two, be quiet. -No...! -Masumi, stop it. Mr Director, one more try, please. You're making your late husband jealous. -Mother! -Enough, Masumi. Look lady, she's just acting. No jealousy involved. Right? Kurumi, it's not your turn. Oh dear, did you get jealous? Remember. I don't want to hear your excuses. I’m already dissolving into the crowd. I will pull you back. Leave me alone. I'm so in love with him. Cut! What's wrong? We've met before, haven't we? I'm just another face in the crowd. But I'm thrilled you recognize me. Yeah, okay. You tried to date her? No... Have I got this line correct? - Can't you read it? - Your handwriting is getting worse. Yeah, I've got writer's cramp. Let's finish up for today. We're almost ready to shoot. Everything will be fine. You reckon? See you at 1pm tomorrow. Okay, good job. Will everything be ready by the time we start? You know "Casablanca?" Starring Bogart and Bergman? Everybody knows that film. Are you kidding me? They started shooting with a half-finished script. Seriously? That's the ultimate script. We can finish it off while filming. I guess so. It'll be fine. -We'll be okay. -It's cool. - Good night. - Okay, good night. It won't be fine at all. It's serious, I'm worried. Then why say that? - I had to. - There you go again. You can't say that just because we used to date. That leaves out a lot of women. Is that you? You shouldn't make me worry. Why are you worried? Your script's still not finished, right? You shouldn't be all on your own. Any chance you'll ever catch a suitable girl in the rye? Come on, let's go home. Yes, speaking. Is that right? I'll drop around tomorrow. Toei Studio, B1, isn't it? Great, thanks. Bye. You're end-game terminal, Kobayashi. This script is terrible. It goes nowhere. That's the producer's input, they made a mess of it. Shall I finish it off? Leave it to me. How? I'll do the auditions tomorrow and cast the ones I pick. -Don't be silly. -So tomorrow's okay? No auditions tomorrow. I'm visiting a movie set. Who's film? Tamura. Forget that, look. Here. What's that? Don't play dumb. It's your birthday, Katako. That was yesterday. Today just turned into tomorrow. Forgive me. Good morning. Yo, Kobayashi. -Hi. -We're all set up. How's my favorite lame director? -Lame director. -What? I'm here to spy on you. This lamer can't finish his script. I've got writer's block. You write your own scripts? Impressive. You know, it's been a year since she died. This time last year, right? One year. She was a good kid. You're both so gloomy. But I feel like a new person now. This is a take. -Roll. -Rolling. Watch and learn. We're ready! Camera. Action! I'm nothing but myself. I'm myself, but me. - I'm more myself. - I'm more myself than you. - No, I'm far more. - I'm more myself than you are. That's enough! No darling, wait. -What the hell? -That hurt. Who are those idiots? Cut! You extras. Stop hogging the camera. Normal facial expressions. Don't overdo it. No voices, either. Sorry. You dominated that shot. Impressive performance. I expect no less. Attention, all bit-part players. We'll do that again. Return to your original positions. One more try, okay. Hey, you guys. Facial expressions, that's all we want. You drowned out the actor. The sound guy's furious. But the actor didn't have lines. That's not the point. Just keep your mouths shut. That's rude. We get it. We won't say a word. Roger, A.O.K. And no more moving closer to the camera. They're the main cast, not you guys. I told you this yesterday, right? Yes, I'm very sorry. I fully understand. What's his problem? Cheeky bugger. No, that's his job. He's still young. Back off, guys. You're so mature, a real sage. This time extras please be quiet. We'll go again. Get ready. Start moving. You two, first time on a movie set? -Yes. -I'm quite nervous. Take your cue from me. He's been doing this for 40 years. Just be natural. Walk like you normally do on the street. Try to remember that. And walk naturally. Even extras need to have the talent to act. Learn from The Master. You're really something. He's like the King of the Extras. Don't overdo it. Have you been in many movies? I'm in almost all movies made here. Recently I did... I know. Come to my place after this shoot. I'll show you my work. We'd love to. I'm home. Dear, your father's home. Masae, prepare 4 cups of tea. Excuse us. Thanks for looking after my dad. Hello, we're back again. I assume you're all staying for dinner? Thank you. We'd love that. - How do you do. - Nice to meet you. You appeared in every one of these films? It's a list of Japanese film masterpieces. Tell them some of your stories. Anyway, sit down. Look! Incredible. -That one, too. -Wow. We watched that together. Too soon to be impressed. Those films don't include anything less than 5 seconds of screen time. In every film here, he's up on screen for 10 to 15 seconds. 15 seconds? As an extra? If you're on longer, do you get a billing? Listen. If we liken a movie to a hamburger, extras are neither cheese, nor meat. We're more like the onions. Without them, something is missing. No one pays attention to extras, but without them, it's very sad. I agree. Extras melt into the scene and transform into scenic elements. It's akin to a humble flower, blooming naturally. Exactly. We melt into the scene. Amazing. Wanna watch this? -That's famous. -I've seen it. No, actually you haven't. Because you didn't notice him. Once you spot him, you can say you've seen the movie. -I know this scene. -It's famous. It's too dangerous here. We'll survive and meet again. See you soon. There he is. And stop! -14 seconds! -Incredible! And so natural. You really were melting into the scene. One of my best performances. Without a doubt. - Next one? - For sure. What's next? See this. That's a famous film. That was pathetic. What did you say? I'm laughing at how lame they were. You're mocking them? Don't they deserve it? They're dedicated! The worst actors I've ever seen. Forget them, are you free tonight? No way. See you later. -What? -See you! Will no one listen to my song? One second is enough. Stop in your tracks to hear my song! You! Sing your heart out, girl! Great! Thanks. Why did you have to die? Does anyone want my car? Hey! Someone, anyone! Take my car. Listen! Will someone take this car? When I look back... How does it go again? I'm Yasuko, I'm 20 years old. "Yasu" means cheap, right? What are the lyrics again? When I look back... I can't remember the words. My name is Yasuko. In the end... even the blood under my nails is washed away. How do I put it? You're already dead. Isn't that right? That's why I'm not nervous anymore. Right? You were good at pretending to be dead. Are you pretending now? Dad! Or are you dead? Okay, I get it. This time you really are dead. Good. Good. Great. All because of me, right? Did I kill you? Wow! Isn't she something! She'll nail the audition. Mr Director, can we start? Sure, let's go. I picked up that chick in Shibuya. That was far out. Totally awesome. She was super-cute. Yeah, she was a real catch. Can you shut the fuck up? You need to live life on the edge. Get used to the uncertainty. If you can maintain that, it becomes your normal. You'll get used to being nervous, on edge. That's when you push it higher. Listen up, you guys. In terms of levels of attainment, you're all here. You will rise up to here. Adapt to that and the tension rises. You'll advance to here. When you're at your wits end, you'll be here. Only then can you say you're awesome. - Got it? - Yes, Ma'am. Let's start. Camera, action! Look at the crowds. Such a throng of humanity. So many people, flocking to shop the malls. Faceless people, all wearing masks. Flowing like an unceasing tide. We all part of that crowd. You, too. I've forgotten my own face. I can't remember my voice. That hurt. Cut! Get her off him! - Can you explain that? - I can! I hate your work. I don't want to be in it. Drop dead! All of you. Oh, sorry about that. Quite honestly, I'm actually eager to pass this audition. Such raw, murderous intent. My father just died. I feel fantastic despite his death. It's good for my acting. I feel so refreshed. My repulsive, repugnant, revolting dad is dead. He's actually dead? Apparently, he stabbed himself in the chest. I wonder he killed himself? Long, long ago, I fell in love with my dad. I was wearing these same clothes the first time he raped me. I fell madly in love with him. Not actually love, though. Something like love. I squashed that love with these hands, just like killing a fly. The room's awash with blood and cum. I cleaned up our love-mess. I put our love away. Well? - Do you like love? - No, I'm not good at love. It's probably better that way. Being into love is so cheap. My name means cheap, so I'm into cheap love. Most likely, that's Karma. My life has always been cheap, anyway. But you are in love, right? During a storm, or on a very windy day, umbrellas and newspapers fly away. Ending up, bunched up, in some park. That's what my love is like. It's all about getting stuck together, to fuck, before I kill them. Farewell. That's my story. Continue to entrust your spirit to the wind. It's not as noble as that. Sexual desire drives me to loneliness. That's all. Now I must go cut up his body, to dispose of it. It's time I said my goodbyes. Thank you for coming. -Wow! -That was magnificent. No way. Don't put that lunatic on our set. Maybe you're right. Get her! I want her. I've got the perfect story. What is it, Katako? It opens as a girl with attitude is walking by. She's fighting her inner demons... Don't ignore me. Don't do that. It hurts. Next group, please go inside. We met in the coffee shop, remember? -Did we? -You gave me a flyer. You said come, so I came. You said act, so I'll act. For the part, right? I'm Eiko Onoda. Nice to meet you. Catch up later, girls. Maybe have sex afterwards. I feel lucky. I'll get this part. Let's go. Why are you all even here? That's typical of you. So selfish. Now I have less chance of being picked. Don't be nasty. Everyone, be quiet. You haven't a chance in Hell. What's wrong with all of us doing our best? What's your problem? -No problem. -The problem is these backstabbers. Shut up. Traitors are among us. We met at the coffee shop. Camera, action! What? Action. What? Do you realize the world will stop? Camera, action! What? What? Do you realize the world will stop? Do you realize it will stop? Stop? No. But I know it'll end. - I know it'll end. - I know it'll end. - I know it'll end. - I know it'll end. - No, it'll stop. - No, it'll stop. Action. No, it'll stop. Everything will stop. Everything will stop. All memories will stop. Everything will stop. Everything, including bonds, relationships, friendships and love. What are you saying? Has lack of sleep sent you crazy? No way am I crazy! You went insane over lack of sleep? I'm sane, I told you. Like when the train next to yours starts moving, you think you're moving. Same thing. I'm sane, but the world's gone mad. That's right. Shut the fuck up! What? What? You do realize the world will stop? Everything will just cease to exist. What are you saying? It will all stop, love, friendships, everything What are you saying? Shut up! Cut! Thank you. That was good. See you. -I want that kid. -Which kid? -That kid over there. -Be more specific. Let's talk about it. Let's do it! I've got an idea. I'll write a script. Throw away this boring script. The girls are out walking together, Yasuko throws green paint over them. Then she shouts. They all resume walking, when Kiriko appears. She throws mauve paint, then she jeers. A wave of girls appears, throwing pink paint and jeering. Finally, I appear and throw white paint on them. I laugh out loud and make an announcement. This entire world is ruled by concrete roads. But they're not good, or evil. Only man controls other men. Hello, it's Muto. Good evening. - Kobayashi's asleep. - Is that right? Who are you? How's the script going? I'm a scriptwriter. He hired me. Wake him up. No, deal with me. Can you stop bringing him these weird projects? This was commissioned by a senior executive. -It still sucks. -Tell Kobayashi I called. -Muto, okay? -Sure. Bye then. You're hurting me. Don't, I'm ticklish. - What about down here? - Naughty man. Look, Mr Muto. Cast me in a movie. -You want to act? -Yes, definitely. -What kind of part? -The heroine. Mr Muto, it's the Big Guy. Don't let me drop it. Give us a moment. What? Where are you going? Sorry, this is super-important. Forgive us. Listen up, Muto. Make a light, frothy, film next time. Nothing too heavy. You got that? I want Kobayashi to direct. He's not light and frothy. He's a pain in the ass. It's your job to make it work with him. Keep him on track. Are you with me? I'm counting on you. Okay, I get it. So get a different director? That's my point. Don't you get it? If Kobayashi's on board, we'll get into film festivals. I really need that kind of option. I know, sir, but... I'm relying on you, Muto. No Boss, please. That hurts! -Produce my fucking film! -The pain... Have you got his contact details? I do. No, I don't. Well, which it is? I know it, I just don't have it now. I can get it for you right away. Okay, that's good. Can you do it? With this script? You confirm it, okay? You can, right? Can I change it a little? I can't use it as-is. I thought so. It's too light, is it? - Is it? - Yes, it is. I'll leave that to you. Also, the budget is tiny, okay? Tell him. He's right. It's barely this big. Yes, that's doable. Why did you accept such a low-budget project? I find it hard to believe. Ask him about that. Can you give us a reason? There's this woman... How can I best put this? Anyway, 10 years ago, on my first self-production, I cast her. I want to go back those days when she was my heroine. Will you audition amateurs to form your main cast? Ask him that. Will you cast amateurs? Yes, I want to start from zero. Zero? To regain the passion I had when I first started. Like when I first met that girl. I get it. Tsutomu, say something. I got it. I appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you. Muto, that's not going to work. A full cast of amateurs? You see the pitfalls? Yes, obviously. But he's already setting up auditions for amateur players. Why not trick him? Feed him actresses we want to be auditioned. Skillfully maneuver to cast only the people we choose. That way, we'll end up with the cast we want. You got that? We can't do that. Listen, Muto. I know you can do it. You know what's at stake? I understand. Listen, Muto. You're a fully-grown man. No need to go along with a young director's naivety. I want to cast two actresses. Two famous actresses. Who's good for it? Ririka Sena. Or Hirona Matsumoto. For the rest of the cast, he can choose whoever he wants. But we've already put out ads for the amateur auditions. If we cast either of the two stars you prefer, I doubt the crew will accept it. Muto, that's totally up to you. That's where you come into play. Use your skillful techniques. Got it? How about we ask your two choices to come audition for the part? That's it! That works! You've impressed me. You're good. Someone wants to meet you. Hey! This kid is destined to be a big star. I'm Anon. Hello. Long time no see, Mr Muto. Cast her into something real soon, okay? Don't tell me you two already know each other? Yeah, kind of. Our paths have crossed. -Is that right? -Long ago. - It was fun, right? - No, not like that. Really? It was purely business. Purely business, eh? Is that right? So you know him, do you? Yes, I do. You make a great couple. Seriously? Your coffee, sir. Too bloody hot! Sorry. Are you okay? Move, boy. What? Did you see this? Ririka and Hirona have applied for the audition. That's amazing. Big stars like them? Rumor has it that both of them are your super-fans. But I never imagined they'd actually apply for an audition. I'll call their agencies to confirm. They're stars. Why would they apply? Well, we should be celebrating it. Anyway, I'll talk to their agents. What a surprise. This is almost unheard of. What? - He's faking it. - I thought so. You need to tell the director. - That's where you're wrong. - Why? He struggles to make films. If we cast famous actresses, our budget will increase. That makes sense. Don't you get it? It's just another obstacle to overcome. -No, it's not. -Listen. He has my total support to finally create his cinematic masterpiece. You're surprisingly passionate. When it comes to making movies, yes I am. Didn't you know? He's so annoying. You know how I feel. No, never. Please understand. I refuse. But I really do prefer you, Natsume. It's too late. Think of Kurume. Forget about her. What do you think about Ririka and Hirona? It's just lame-game scam, right? This project could be a hit, but not with those two. Without an all-amateur cast, it will fail. You think it sounds lame? So what do we do? Can we restart the interview? Sure. Whenever you want. I've heard you like to read. Yes, lately I'm heavily into Dostoyevsky. Fantastic! Which novel? Pretty much all of them. Name at least one you like. As he's about to be executed, he notices his buttons are done up wrong. Even in his last moments, he still cares about that. Okay, who is it? Oh, Hirona! Will you quit showbiz? No, I'll never do that. But we can't keep this up forever. We can do whenever we want. Like politicians suck out our taxes? Exactly. Even without talent, you can just pretend. But isn't acting just pretending? Of course. If that's the case, my sugar-daddy's an actor. Ms Ririka Sena and Ms Hirona Matsumoto? The auditions are in here. Who's your sugar-daddy? Actually, he's a prominent politician. -He's a genius. -This way. In you go. You're Ririka Sena, right? Why did you apply? Is this the place? Just be quiet. -Don't touch me. -Let's go. I found you! They're waiting. This way, please. We were assaulted by a strange girl. Really? We'd better hurry. Please introduce yourselves. Is that really necessary? How absurd. They're both big stars, do we need to do this? Every applicant does it, so can they. No problem, Mr Muto. It's natural, isn't it? I'm Ririka Sena. How do you do. Nice to meet you. Hirona Matsumoto, pleased to meet you. How do you do. I'm Anon. Pleased to meet you. Can you tell us why you applied for this audition? That's too obvious. I'll start blushing. I'm a big fan of Kobayashi's work. So you chose to be auditioned? Of course. Isn't that just amazing? Any chance I can get some questions over here? The audition went well. Yes, see you later. How could you be so stupid? He could have died. I got mad at him. The thought of you in his arms... Shut-up. Don't ruin it for me. You understand? I have to respect my own rules. Give me a minute. Speaking. Yes, I understand. Is it that bastard? Was that him? Hey. Come back, Anon! Are you okay? Sorry about your mother. She was fine until yesterday. Please fill this in to complete her records. She seemed like such a good mother. "Mask" Audition Application Form Mom? I'm gathering my courage to apply for an audition. I've always wanted to be an actress. But I had to look after you. Time for her drip. No more pain, please. I hate pain. Please hold her arm for me. It won't take long. Sorry this is hurting. It'll soon be over. Sorry, Mom. I know it hurts. Forgive me. Father: Unknown Mother: Yoko Self: Kanna Tsunoda "Mask" Audition Application Form I'll go post my application. I'll go do it now. Where's the stamp? I didn't forget. It never was. Maybe it's some kind of sign. I'm missing something important. Mom. Mommy. A stamp, please. That's 82 yen. I forgot my purse. Is anything wrong? Give me an 82 yen stamp. Hands up. It's all fantasy, anyway. Give me the stamp. Here's your stamp, dear. All fantasy situations need a friend. A fiction film directed by Tadashi Kobayashi. "Mask" A Tadashi Kobayashi Film Casting Call Female 21 years old Your picture Three, two, one. Glue stick You know what this tattoo means? Was it done by an amateur? If you want to piss me off, try harder, kid. - What did you say? - What's your problem? -Wanna fight? -Stop it. Both of you. It's stupid. Move. We're all members of girls gang. Let's all team up. You see this dagger? Hey, girls. We're the strongest girls gang in town. Do you get it? You got it? Audition? Show me. Auditions for Kobayashi's latest movie. You should all apply. Have you, Machiko? No, I haven't. Life is like running continuous laps of an oval. What do you mean? Like breaking up with that bastard Joe, only to meet a man just like him. Which was first? Chicken or egg? Who was first, me or Natsume? Can you two stop talking about that Joe guy? That's like running around an oval. Going round and round in circles. My life is going in circles. Life is so full of contradictions. Diametrically opposed! The dots and lines don't match up. Nothing fits together. That's because you're Natsume. Me, too. I'm stuck in the same place. Anyway, check out this flyer. See you again. Take care. Come back soon. We should have applauded her. Next Morning Hello, Natsume? Hello? What? Go check your mailbox. The thing is... I've just heard back from them. Really? I haven't opened mine yet. Yours will be there, go get it. Oh, yes. I got one. I knew it. Don't open it yet. Let's do that together. Maybe in 30 minutes? Rejected? I failed. -Rejected. -Rejected. I didn't pass. -Me, neither. -Same here. Why? We stood up for that director! -She's right. -Only we could do that. Only us. What went wrong? What did we do wrong? Okay, vocal training. Hi. We all got rejected. What about you? I didn't apply. Why not? You'd get in. I guess we all share the same fate now. Exactly. She's right. We'll apply to be extras. You should come. We're so mad, we want to watch. Machiko, come with us. Great. Here we go! This girl, definitely. Kiriko, a call for you. -Who's calling you? -Hello, Kiriko speaking. Thank you. Well? Come on, tell us. I passed the audition, I'm the female lead. You did it! We'll go with you. We'll be extras. We'll be with you. We'll be there, alongside you. I'm so happy. You did great. I'm really glad. Who else? This girl, too. Ms Yasuko? This is for the crime-lab. Good man. If you remember anything else, please call. We're done for today. Ms Yasuko Yabuki? You passed our audition. Please come for a costume fitting. I will. Come to Toei Studios... She looks good. She's cute. Excellent. How about Kiriko? It suits her. Right, Mr Muto? Yes, very cute. How about Yasuko? Wow, she looks great. It really suits her. I think she looks brilliant. This needs adjusting. What about the pendant? It works on that dress. The other one? I must have her. Where's Kanna? Ms Kanna? Try these on. That'll suit her. Very nice. That get-up makes her even cuter. How's her hair? Hair back. Who's she? The director's pick for female lead. I don't think she's our heroine. I think she is. Listen, Muto. Do you remember a girl named Anon? What? Apparently, you two endured much together. Something bad happened to her boyfriend, right? Scandals are a killer in showbiz. No, please. You're hurting me. You get my meaning? Say yes. Don't mind us. Anon? I think she's a good choice. But we've already chosen Kiriko. What? Is she here? Yes, she's getting changed right now. You saw her earlier, right? It's too late to change now. Invent something. We have to. We need to change some others, too. I can't tell him that at this point. We really do need to cast some professional actresses. Are you serious? Show some respect. Mr Muto, no... You look good. Getting buttons wrong can change a life. Be careful. Thank you. She really looks good. So sweet. Totally cute. - Can I get a second? - What now? I can't say, not here. - What hairstyle? - Down is better. I'm so sorry, Kiriko. We're all sorry. Forgive us. I'm so sorry. Truly sorry. We got the buttons wrong. I was expecting that instantaneous burst of happiness. But it never happened. Shall we go home? I'm sorry, Katako. I really blew it. Katako? Katako? So you're running away again. - Run? To where? - At least do it properly. But you're always so half-assed. -What do you mean? -You know. When I died, you ran away. Now you're running away by bowing to their orders. You'll give in, again, and make their movie. Stick up for yourself. How do I do that? You know how. Stop making excuses. Mr Director. Mr Director. Mr Director. Let's go. Here we go. Get up. How do I look, Mr Muto? Great. You look gorgeous. But I don't like this bit. It really should be tighter. Hello there. The newcomer? Hello. So you're Anon? - Yes. Pleased to meet you. - Same here. You can come through now. Another audition? What's with her? Is she crazy? Hey! A TV crew is here. It's a real scandal. I want you to move out. Because of you, we have TV crews out front. Shooting starts today. No point sitting here, waiting. We'll support Kobayashi whatever it takes. We can do that by becoming extras. Support him with our love and presence. Stand behind him, bolster him with our love. Our love is immortal. Unto death we are the Kobayashi True Love Club! The Kobayashi True Love Club! Yasuko Yabuki of Kunitachi City, Tokyo. She spent a week with her father's body, after he killed himself. Cause of death was massive internal bleeding and it's believed he stabbed himself to death. A visiting housekeeper raised the alarm and called the police. An investigating officer later found the body. Come on, cheer up. There'll be other chances. Yasuko... Here she comes now. Any comment for us, Yasuko? What did I do wrong? I just wanted to be with him. I loved him. Is that a crime? Even if it is, I don't care. My life is more precious than what justice calls a crime. You! You! You're filming the wrong thing. Aim your camera at the ones you love. Don't you love anyone? Love! She was supposed to be in the film with me. Really? Seriously? Why didn't you call the police? No, please... Stop that. Please, Yasuko. How many times must I tell you? I'll be in that movie, whatever it takes. But how? I'll work as an extra. That's pointless. No! I will go. Kiriko! Wait, dear. Makoto is calling to me. Makoto, wait for me. You'll never be a star by playing an extra in a crowd. Exactly. It goes nowhere. Eiko! Did you expect to fail? I never expected to pass the audition. That's life. That's for sure. That's what it is to be an actress. It's just like the lottery. We can never win. Forget about it. Thanks for this. I'm a big fan of Kobayashi. I get to see him at work. I'm so excited. All thanks to me. I'll never forget your generosity. It's starting up. Camera, action! Look at the crowds. Such a throng of humanity I just failed the audition, gimme a break! I wanted that role. Flowing like an unceasing tide. We all part of that crowd. You, too. I've forgotten my own face. I can't remember my voice. I don't remember your face, either. Remember. I don't want to hear your excuses. Are you here to audition as an extra? Is that an offer? I'm free. I'm an extra, the definition of free. -Leave me alone. -No way! Leave me alone! I couldn't care less. You're strangely enthusiastic. Okay, take me too. I'm sorry. So what's next? I love you! Shall we go into showbiz? What are you murmuring? Prepare for the worst. Live boldly. Yeah, live boldly. Look at that beautiful blue sky. It makes me want to shoot off fireworks. Is it okay to display our poster here? Of course, no problem. Can we talk while they're shooting? Yusuke? Yusuke! Where are you? Where are you? Wasn't she your choice? Long ago, there was a French poet, Henri Michaux. At the movies, he'd only ever look at the extras, never the stars. He was far more interested in extras. It's not too late. Make her your heroine. -Let's do it! -Be quiet. Kyoko! Sakako! Where are you? Hako! What's going on here? Is she a good actress? No. Kiriko would be much better. She took Kiriko's role? Not her. She's on next. She got my part. Her acting sucks. Kiriko is much better. She sure is. I love you. More feeling! More depth! I'll never let you go. Same here. No looking at the camera. Be patient. When you hear screaming, look back, in surprise. It's too late for that. No, it isn't. Which one? Tell me. Does anyone know? Does anyone know? We must find out. Hey there, Machiko! Excuse me. I'll have this one. Yes, thank you. -Then... -How may I help you? I mean... Just say anything at all. In that case... I'll have that one, too. Thanks. That's 2000 yen. Just pretend you're paying. Okay. Thank you. Clapper board! Cut! What's going on over there? I'll walk to there. Let's pretend we eloped here. Whatever. Or maybe we're both planning to die? Whatever. It's so hot. -Are you hungry? -Yeah. Will they give us lunchboxes? They're just props. But aren't they gorgeous? They're real shoes. Are they for sale? No, they're props, for the movie. Quieten down, girls. It's those old fart security guards. How come you're here? We're working as extras. She was at the audition, too. I sense a ghost. The one from the audition. She's the heroine from Kobayashi's first movie. And his ex-girlfriend. So hungry. -Are you? -I'm starving. My friend runs a bar nearby. Let's grab a drink after this. We're working, get real. Don't hit on the extras. I'm sorry. If you're not dedicated, don't even audition. Listen pal, go back to pretending to be a shoe salesman. Okay. Anyone want shoes? First time in a movie? I've no time for amateurs. Piss off. Okay, that's cool. Shoes, anyone? Yes, I need shoes. Extras, that was great. Keep up that vibe. You don't get what I'm trying to accomplish here. You're the worst actress. -Sorry. -You're hopeless. Go do your job. No, you're right, Mr Director. -Not you again. -Everything okay? -You're great, Ken. -Thanks. Listen, never look at the camera. I'm sorry. -Okay? -So sorry. What's your name? Extras don't have names. Not in the script, I know. Sometimes we're designated passerby A, B or C. Okay then, I'm A. I'm B. And I'm C. No one asked you. Do you guys ever stop talking? -No talk. -Be professional. So sorry. You, come with me. It's Kiriko, right? You take her position, okay. -Hi there. -How do you do. -Well done. -Kiriko, go for it! Go for it! I didn't like that. Play it back. What's wrong? Show me. -What? -That extra's hogging the scene. -Which one? -There. Extras should blend-in, not stick out. Look, he's kissing her. It's too distracting. The bastards. All extras, do exactly as instructed. Do not ad lib, or move around. You two. You ruined that take. You kissed her, didn't you? What were you thinking? I'm sorry. Don't draw attention to yourselves. I thought it would look good. - Who do you think you are? - He's just having fun. Not on my set! Those stars over there are the center of attention. You're like a haze, drifting across the screen. Never stick out. Even haze has a reason for being. I'm so sorry. But you guys did a brilliant job. Thanks for that. You were great. -I wish this would end. -Why? We're extras, it's too easy. No responsibilities. Let the stars do the hard work. That's not our gig. All we have to do is pretend to be doing the roles we're assigned. Pretending, eh? Sounds like my entire life. What's that? You live life as an extra. I'm the heroine in my life. Always. Don't start. Good for you. Okay, no fighting, girls. What's the problem? Get ready to go again. Attention, extras. I shout "camera action." Start at "camera," not "action." You lot shut up, concentrate. Stop annoying me. All passersby... Joe's starting to get angry. He's upset. Just like Kobayashi. Yell if you hear me! Here we go! We're ready, Mr Director. Get into the groove, feel the vibe! Sound rolling. Camera! Action! Be natural. Yusuke? -How do you do. -Nice to meet you. I'm busted and broken. What's that crap? We're going around in circles. Who cares? You all skip from topic to topic. We're pretending to go round and round. I told you to cut that out. I'm sorry. But I'm so in love with him. Yusuke. Yusuke. Hako! Hey! Big bad news! Cut! Anon! How many times must I tell you? You need to show it, act it, not read it. Sorry. If you can't do it , I'll get an extra who can. Every single one of them wants to be a star. Raise your hand if you want stardom. Who wants to take Anon's role? Should I choose one of them? You're hopeless. Enough. -I'll try harder! -Okay, do it again. Joe, hurry up! Back to your original positions, right now. Here we go. She should quit! Anon, quit acting. Camera. Camera. It's rolling. -Camera! -Move. Action! Yusuke? -Excuse me. -May I help you? I’m already dissolving into the crowd. That one, please. Thank you, Miss A. Are you free after this? Maybe a date? Mr B, no hitting on girls on the set. Mr C, mind your own business. Ms A wants to be an actress, right? She has no time for you. She must concentrate on her art. If you were a professional, you'd know we're not in frame. In my mind, I'm always in frame. Always ready to be filmed. -You're no professional. -Shut up! But I'm determined to be an actress. Can you be quiet? I'm serious. What's your real job? You pretend that you're not wearing a mask. Look, they're filming the opposite side. Shut up. I once looked back to check and ruined a shot. Never again. Such an amateur. Those boring words aren't your truth. I've just started, I have a future here. I want you to live life seriously. I know, but... What will you do? That is terrible. Cut! Anon, you just don't get it! Show your emotion with your voice. -Sorry. -We'll do it again. Everyone, back in place. We'll do it again. Kiriko, back to being a passerby. You can stay here. We're free. You and I will be free. Who are you? Miss. Follow the rule. You shut up! What? Is this a joke? I get it. You're the "necessary evil." That's just a smug excuse. I don't care if it's good or bad. I come when needed. Kiriko. Yasuko. Let's assume the leading roles. - What? - Make up your mind. - It's my decision? - Yes, so decide! I understand. Then let's take over, now. Sorry about all the re-takes. We're almost there. You reckon? You want to act? I do. Becoming famous is a long, hard road. Not for us. Very soon. Right away. That's ridiculous. Just relax. What happened? Extras start moving when I say "camera." Extras! No milling around. Follow all orders. Here we go. I can't hear you. Let's do it. Start walking. Camera! Action! We're taking over, you got it? Aye aye, sir. Hold it. Those two... Kobayashi. I quit! I'm out of here! Cut! I'm going home! Cut! Come back! Joe, do something. Director Kobayashi! Somebody, do something! Katako! - You, do something. - It's your fault. - How dare you? - You fucked it, you fix it! You two, stop that. Let's run away together. Katako! Mr Director! Come back! I bust my ass for you every time. But I've had enough. Do whatever the hell you want. Mr Director! I totally respect the aesthetics of your work. I'm just a no-talent bum. But I've given you everything I have. Farewell forever! I'm here for you! Look at me. Who the hell are you? We're yours. Leave me alone! Let's all work together. I'll be your heroine. Kobayashi! What's going on? No idea, but we must keep walking. With our heads held high. With our heads held high. Fix it, do something. Fuck you, I quit! What happened? This is terrible... Don't do that! So you two are still dating? Yeah, you're right. I'm a bastard. We're still in a relationship. I'm a scumbag, right? What do you mean? -Kurumi. -Natsume! Leave her, get mad at me. I'm the fool, the loser, the scumbag. Listen everyone! He is the worst guy ever! -He is! -And me, too. Not you. He's to blame. -I'll beat you up! -Go on. You, bastard! Don't underestimate girl-power. We're the meanest, toughest, girl-gang ever! You got that? You got that? Yo u're totally awesome. What's with you? I don't care anymore. Pull yourself together! Let's take it to the limit! You stole my girlfriend away. You stole my girl! What the hell is going on here? For a movie, this is crazy. But I love it. You need to quit. - You're no good. - What? - Do I need to teach you? - Are you serious? Change! Change! Security? Weirdo over here. Can someone come and take her away? Now fuck off! This is filmmaking at its best! Let's run with it, okay? Kiriko, let's do it. Camera! Action! Kyoko! Sakako! Where are you? Kyoko! I'm here. Where are you, Kyoko? Who are you? Who are you? Who the hell are you? Kyoko! Hako! I'm here! You're not Kyoko. You're not the star. Yes, I am! Who are you? Where are you? I'm here! Kiriko! I'm here. Yasuko? Awesome! I'll be a lead actress, too. Me, too. -Me, too. -Me, too. Keep it rolling! Don't stop! Let's keep going till we reach the horizon! Okay everyone, listen. Do it! Do as he says! Go for it! Go for it! If we stand idly by, freedom will disappear forever. Everyone, rise! Are you happy being faceless extras? Face up to the reality of life as an extra. It's broken me. What's wrong with that? Farewell, passersby! What's wrong with being broken? Kiriko's leaving. She's leaving us. Marry me! Oh, go away! Freedom is disappearing from our world. Everyone, rise up! Are you happy being faceless extras? Face up to the reality of life as an extra. Face your reality! Fight against your reality! Hey, what's going on? You two, stop now! Stop filming. Stop the camera. Do as I say. Written, Directed & Edited by Sion Sono The Red Post Box on Escher St.
