Doctor! Doctor! Doctor! Mister! Sumi. Please come with me to my home. My father's condition is getting worse. He's been crying out in pain. Please. Do you still have any pills left from my last visit? No, they're gone. But he's getting worse, and he's also hallucinating. I think his leg is septic. Let's go. I need morphine, doc. Listen to me, doctor. Please, listen to me, doc. What are you doing, doc? Please, doctor! Doctor! Did you bury my left leg, Sumi? - Not yet. - Why not? You have to bury it as soon as possible. The sooner the curse leaves our family the better. We've been living in misery ever since the disease began ravaging my leg. Do you think it was easy cleaning up all blood stains in the living room? I scrubbed and scrubbed and it just wouldn't come out. I swear to God if you don't bury the leg... I swear to God, I'll do it tomorrow. Not now! So, what are you gonna do? I want my father to get better... so I can have my freedom. Freedom to do what? Leave home. Where do you want to go? The city, maybe? Maybe find my mother and brother, Ahmad. You know the city is big, Sumi. Are you sure you want to go there alone? I could... go with you. But only if you want me to. Right now, I'm focusing on survival. I have to reopen my dad's gulai stall. I can take you to my boss, Mr. Mimin. Who knows? Maybe he can help you. You have to wait. He's still with another guest. I want to learn how to butcher a goat. Tarno, can you teach my friend? Saber. Come in. Let's go. Sir. Can I borrow one of your goats to reopen my father's gulai stall? Do you think you can cook as well as your dad, Karto? If you don't cook it properly, the meat will smell musky. I'll do my best. - You'll do your best? - Yes. Can you guarantee you won't fail? Come back in a year. When your breasts are plumper and more mature... then I might reconsider taking you on... as my mistress. - Sumi! - Saber. Where do you think you're going? Get in here. Are you deaf or what, Sumi? I've been calling you! Are you having fun with your friends out there? Leaving your crippled father alone at home, right? Why is it still bleeding? It must be infected! It's healing, Dad. Can't you see that? Look! Do you think this kind of wound will heal any time soon? Go get Dr. Freedman! Now! - Where's the morphine? - Dr. Freedman's not home. Son of a bitch! Do you want to try cannabis instead? How do you know anything about cannabis? It's cheaper than morphine. Do you want to make me an addict? Hasn't the morphine made you one already? What's the difference? If you take the correct amount, cannabis can help you with the pain. I'm hungry, Sumi. Me too. I cooked the remaining rice for your breakfast porridge. Do you expect me to work in this condition? Isn't it time for you to be a good daughter? What do you think I've been doing? I've taken care of you for so long, I've forgotten I ever had dreams or a life of my own. How dare you. You should've left with your mother. I don't need women like you or your mother. Like mother like daughter. Bitch! Sumi... I've been watching you. Who are you? How did you get in? I'm the only way out of all your troubles, Sumi. Sumi... Let me offer you the quickest solution. Sumi... I want to be your friend, Sumi. Take my hand, Sumi. Come on, Sumi. I won't hurt you. Sumi. Mom. Mom! Mom! - Mom. - I'm coming home. I want you to enjoy your youth. Yes. Sumi. That could be your future. But only if you'll be my friend. Yes. I'll be your friend. Sumi, feed your father his own leg. And mix a few drops of this liquid into his food. It's good. Where did you get the meat? You don't need to know. Didn't you say that it's now my job to put food on the table? Saber! What's going on? It's Ningrum. Mr. Doni's daughter. She is gone. She didn't come home last night. - Have you seen her? - No. All right, then. Her body was found at the foot of the hill. She was half naked with a gaping head wound. It looks like blunt force trauma. Sumi, where are you going? I have to talk to Dr. Freedman. Doctor. My father's wound has been getting worse lately. He's crying out in even more pain. Can you prescribe him painkillers? I'll pay you once I get the money. Follow me. Sister! Where's Mom, sister? Avenge me, sister! Where's the food, Sari? I'm hungry! Sumi... You know what you have to do, Sumi. Don't pretend you're innocent. Sumi. You can... create your own happiness. Sumi. Heal your father, Sumi. And then you can leave this village, free as a bird. Enjoy your youth, which belonged to you in the first place. Come on, Sumi. Accept my offer. Dig up that fresh corpse, Sumi! Do it! Is it good? Yes, Sumi. Here you go. I made it with fresh goat's milk. Ningrum's body is gone! - Are you sure? - I swear. Someone dug up the grave and took her body! Let's go there. Saber. I'm coming too. Who took my sister Ningrum's body? Who took her? Tell me who! I'll make them pay! Don't be afraid, Sumi. I'm your new friend. You can't get away from me. My whispers in your ear give you peace. Sumi! I'm your freedom! Sumi. Are you afraid of me? I'm only offering you eternal peace. Eternal love. I can help you achieve your dreams, Sumi. Sumi! I can heal your father in the blink of an eye. I know, Sumi. Saber promised he'd help you find your mother, right? But do you really believe him? What if Saber only wants your body? Sumi. What if we use Saber for another purpose? If you want to leave this village, then you need money. So you need to sell food one last time. But this time, you'll use fresh meat. Not a corpse. Not rotting flesh. Only fresh meat. Sumi! I can destroy your dreams, Sumi! I can take away your freedom. You'll be trapped in this village until you rot! And you'll never see your mother again. Is that what you want? Sumi! Sumi, he's your ticket to freedom. Come on. Are you okay, Sumi? I heard you scream. I've never seen anything like that. Too many strange things happen in this village. A murder. A missing body. Let's leave this village. Now's the perfect time. Sumi! Don't listen to that bastard! Sumi! You have to decide now, Sumi. We have to leave now, before it's too late. Please, Sumi. Sumi! Sumi! Yes. Sumi! Don't take my daughter away from me, Saber! Son of a bitch! Sumi. Do you want to die? Die or do what I say, Sumi! Stop whispering evil in my ear. I've sinned because of you. Go away. Go! I don't want to be your friend anymore. Do you hear me? I don't want to be your friend anymore. What are you doing, Sumi? What are you doing, Sumi? Sumi! I love you! But I was too scared to tell you. I only want you, Sumi. Please believe me. Don't believe him, Sumi. He came to you because his boss told him to steal your gulai recipe. I can't blame them... your food stall is such a hit. I'm the only one who cares about you, Sumi. I'm the only one who cares about you. Only me, Sumi! Sumi! Sari. Look. Sumi! Sumi! My God! Sumi. I'm doing this to make you better, Dad. So I can go find Mom and convince her to come back home. I want her to be a good wife to you so I can enjoy my life as a teenager. Excuse me. Do you know where Cempaka lives? Do you mean Asih? Her house is at the end of that row of rooms. There she is, sitting in front of her room. Thank you. Asih Cempaka? I need to ask you something. But you'll pay for that information, right? No problem. As long as I get what I came for. Do you know anything about this bracelet? That's mine! Give it back! Where did you find it? It belonged to my sister, Ningrum. Don't play dumb with me. - Can't you read my name on it? - Exactly. I want to know why I found this bracelet in her closet. I know it has your name on it, but Ningrum was not a thief. Don't waste my time, whore. You're still defending your thief of a sister? Whore and thief. Thief! Thief! Thief! Thief! I know you stole this bracelet! You bastard! How dare you steal my bracelet and give it to that bitch! Sari, how are you? Do you still remember the deal you made with me? The kind that you can't just easily walk away from. I can help you refresh your memory. My power helped you so much, Sari. Who cured your sister when she got sick, Sari? You traded me your freedom for her life. Sir, can you give me food? I'm hungry. Who protected you when you had to take care of her? I gave you a little gift of my power. Thank you, sir. You ate the food I gave you. Your sister grew up healthy. All thanks to me. But then you left me. You turned your back on me. And now that your sister is dead, your life is worthless. With the death of your sister, your life now has no purpose. Sari... Take out your box, Sari. Take it out. Take it out. Take it out! Sari. You broke your deal with me. How about you go back to doing what you used to do, Sari? What is it, Sari? - Blood, Dad! - What blood? It's just water. Sari, please help me. Ningrum. Please help me, sis. Aren't you dying to know who killed your sister, Sari? Avenge your sister's death! Only you can do it, Sari. Lightning strikes the ground, breaking the fence, bound by a spell... Don't wake up because it's in your head! When you're sick, then you will fall. When you fall, you will be dead! Lightning strikes your body. The person who killed my sister, Ningrum. Kill the person who killed Ningrum. Whoever killed her is gonna die a very painful death. Come in, doctor. Why did you feel you needed to come here? Don't you think it's better if I go to your place, instead? Visiting patients at their homes is nothing new to me. - Doctor. - Yes? Somebody died in the brothel. Oh, no. I'll be right there. I'll inform the village leader. - Excuse me. - Okay. I have to leave. - Can I come with you, doctor? - Okay. What? You realize I'm going to examine a dead body? I know. Maybe I can be of some help there. Fine. Let's go. Excuse me. Did he live alone? He lived here with his mother, in the next room. But we can't find her. When the officers come, tell them to prepare his funeral. Thank you. Help! What's that sound? Help! That's my father calling me. He's sick. I'm sure he's just mad at me for ignoring him. So that's Mr. Karto screaming. I thought it was somebody else. But is he okay, Sum? He's sick. It's understandable that he's upset. His leg's still raw from the amputation. But he's screaming for help. Help me! What do you want, Mr. Mimin? I heard your father screaming for help. He's fine. Besides, it's none of your business. Maybe he's screaming because he pooped in his pants. Do you want to wipe up his shit? Bitch. Help! Help me! Sumi! Don't even think about making another sound. No one will hear you scream. Help me! Don't test my patience! Help me! Shut up, Dad. Shut up. Shut up! Please, shut up! Shut up! What do you want? Your childhood friend sent me here. He's got a present you can't refuse. He wants me to give it to you. Sumi, this house shelters a secret that you should know about. I don't want to know anything about this house. Move. I'm getting out of here. I just don't want you to regret your decision. Who knows? Maybe the secret is about your mother. Don't you dare speak ill about my mother! Sumi. I'm not a liar. Who knows, maybe this house contains what you've been looking for all along. Your father stands between you and the gates of heaven. I'm gonna tell the whole village what a monster you are. What are you doing, Sumi? Sumi! It can't be. This morning the stump was still bleeding. You can let him keep guarding the gate, or you can remove him. People who tell lies are those who don't believe in Allah's words. And they are the liars. Do you want to try the pork? Pork will drag us to hell, Ijah. In hell, we'll be tortured in equal measure with the sins we committed when we were alive. Our whole body will be cut in half, butchered, and then made whole again. And what will they do with an evil witch like you? Me? I denounced God and made a pact with the devil. I have my own special place in hell, Mak Ijah. Just like the adulterer who killed the woman carrying his child! Buras gave that bracelet to Ningrum. I'm sure you know him well. You knew how to manipulate Buras because he just copied what his mother's clients did to her. Believing sex and women could be bought with money or objects, he lacked self-restraint because he didn't know better. You taught him to kill. You're the one who really killed Ningrum, Dr. Freedman. You're so smart. I used someone else's hand to get rid of Ningrum. It's because I can't stand the smell of local people. The smell of poor people. I'm shocked that you find me guilty as charged in your court of justice, Sari. Sari. Do you want to arrest me, Sari? It doesn't mean anything! You have no evidence, Sari. You need evidence if you want to drag someone into any court! You also need witnesses. Your words will get you nowhere. How dare you come to my house and act so arrogantly? Do you believe in the supernatural? Yes, sir. Do you really believe in it? Or do you believe in science? My skill cured your husband from tuberculosis. Am I right? Why did you need to think twice? I thought you hated this whore! Or maybe you're scared of her because you're afraid she'll put a curse on you. If she were a real witch, she should've put a curse on me and saved herself the trip here to confront me. Now, Mak Ijah! Please spare me! I don't know anything about your revenge! Please let me go! I'm gonna spare you eternal damnation in hell by torturing you right here. Tell me you're sorry for killing my sister, Ningrum. And that you deserve to die for it. I'm sorry for killing your sister, Sari. But I don't want to die. I confess to Almighty God, to Jesus Christ, to the blessed Virgin Mary, to blessed Michael the Archangel, to the holy apostles Peter and Paul, and to all the saints... You're evil, Sari. And you're a coward. We're the same, doctor. We're both sinners and monsters. We belong in hell. Dad! Dad! Dad! - Dad! - Sumi. Karto could be anywhere. But I know where he's hiding. If you want to know, you must promise me something. I have to leave this godforsaken village. Once this problem is taken care of, I'm leaving this village and never coming back. Dad! Dad! Don't hide from me, Dad. We can talk, you know. Dad! If you're nice to me, I can be nice to you too. But don't do anything stupid... because I will not hesitate. Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad... Dad? Dad! I thought you really loved me. I thought you were being sincere when you told me that you really needed me. Turns out, you lied to me. I wasn't lying. I really love you. He's manipulating you, Sumi. He's robbing you of your youth, Sumi! He doesn't love you. - You're a liar. - I love you, Sumi. But... I'm also afraid of you. You... You're a monster, Sumi. Dad. The apple doesn't fall far from the tree. I became a monster... because you are a monster. That's nonsense, Sumi. Do you think you're innocent? You let my mother and my brother go who knows where. And you never once tried to find them. Not once. And you're always cursing me, yelling at me, and ordering me around! Enough, Sumi! That's enough! Don't stop, Sumi. Don't stop! Your father is running out of excuses. Now ask him where your mother is. Dad... Where's my mother, Dad? Where is she? - She ran away to the city! - He's lying, Sumi. Ask him. Why did she leave? Why did she leave? She left with another man. Shameless adulteress! - Liar. - Your mother is a whore! - Liar! - Your mother is a whore! Tell me the truth! Tell me the truth! Where's my mother? If you want to hear the truth, then stop listening to the devil whispering in your ear. Ask protection from God, the Lord of all humanity. He's distracting you, Sumi. He's quoting verses without knowing the meaning. Sumi. Sumi! Where's my mother? - Where is she? - Please, don't! Please, I will tell you the truth. Where's my mother? Please, tell me. I never loved your mother. I married her because your grandmother made me do it. I loved another woman. She was a beautiful prostitute. She was the most beautiful woman in this village. Her name was Asih Cempaka. She gave birth to a deformed baby the same year your brother Ahmad was born. Every time I saw that kid, I was reminded of my disgusting sin. You're a whore! I have nothing to do with that prostitute! How many times do I have to tell you? I'm leaving you! I killed your mother and I buried her body under the bed! Sumi, worship this idol and I will always come for you. Mom! Mom. Mom. Mom. Mom. Forgive me for not being able to protect you. I never knew. You never left this house. I was told to come here to find the body of my sister, Ningrum. Do you know where I can find her? I've come to pick up my lover, Karto. Have you seen him? So it's you. You're the source of all my misery!
