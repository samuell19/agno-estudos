Berlin, April 1945. Nazi Germany is about to fall. Hiding in an underground bunker beneath the city is Adolf Hitler, the man who plunged the world into six years of total war. Hitler had sworn to make the Nazis a world power, inspiring his adoring people with his vision of a thousand-year rule. His armies had ravaged over 3 million square miles of Europe and ignited a world war that killed 55 million people. Now Hitler's world is shriveled to a few cramped rooms below the ruins of Berlin. Above him the Soviet army advances through the city, tightening the noose as they hunt down the Nazi leader. This film goes inside Hitler's bunker to hear previously untold stories of those last desperate days. In extraordinary film interviews, lost to the world for nearly 70 years, we hear from the people who were there what happened on the day Hitler died. The army major who knew that to admit defeat to the Fuhrer meant death. He wanted to live. He loved power like a miser loves gold. The secretary who typed Hitler's last will and political testament. For years he had been taking medicines, drugs and injections. The leader of the Hitler Youth who was the first to see the Fuhrer's body. The blast of the pistol had ruptured the veins on either side of his head. These witnesses from inside Hitler's bunker were filmed just after world war ii. Their testimonies lay forgotten in American archives and have only recently been rediscovered. Did he expect others to commit suicide with him? Yes, Eva Braun. The bunker became a mortuary and the people in it living corpses. None of these witnesses had ever spoken on camera before. Their memories have allowed us to reconstruct in detail the bunker and the actions of the people who witnessed the end of the Nazi third reich and Hitler's final hours. Was there any doubt in your mind that he was going to die? None whatsoever. This is the last time that Adolf Hitler is ever seen in public; the last time he is ever captured on film. He has been Fuhrer of Nazi Germany for 12 years, but at this moment, as he awards medals to boys of the Hitler Youth forced into combat, he is days away from defeat... And from death. Hitler's troops once occupied most of Europe, but now the third reich is reduced to a desperate defense of Berlin. The German capital is surrounded. British and American forces fight in the west and the ferocious Soviet army advances from the east. The man who conquered over 3 million square miles of Europe is now confined to a claustrophobic underground bunker. Buried 30 feet beneath his headquarters, the Fuhrerbunker was constructed in 1944 in response to heavier allied bombing. The ceiling and walls are 12 feet thick, encasing a network of 16 cramped rooms. Lying below the city's sewage system, four flights of steps lead into this subterranean refuge... ...where Hitler has been holed up for four months. The corridor is decorated with looted art. A grandfather clock in Hitler's study is the only way of telling the time. His private sitting room is crammed with oversized furniture brought down from his headquarters above. Next to his bed stands an oxygen tank in case the ventilation should fail. Hitler disappears into this underworld for the final time in April 1945. The only people who know what happened in the bunker are those trapped here with him. Six months after the war has ended, the nuremberg war crime trials begin. Nazi leaders are prosecuted for crimes against humanity, but Hitler isn't on the list. There are rumors he's still alive. Nuremberg judge and U.S. Navy lawyer captain Michael Musmanno decides to track down eyewitnesses to Hitler's final days. His mission: To prove the Fuhrer is dead. Musmanno's search takes him across Germany. Over two years he speaks to more than a hundred people, everywhere from prisons, internment camps and in hiding. In 1948 Musmanno captures his findings on film. I have brought a number of eyewitnesses on the subject of Hitler's disappearance. In their own words they will tell you what happened to the Fuhrer of Germany. The witnesses Musmanno brings together are surviving members of Hitler's civilian and military staff who were with him in the Fuhrerbunker. They have never been interviewed on camera before and need to rehearse their statements in English or speak through a translator. The first witness will be frau Traudl Junge, Hitler's secretary. Traudl Junge started working for Hitler in 1942 when she was only 22 years old. Once she'd dreamed of being a dancer. War put an end to that. Hitler selected her because she was from Bavaria, his favorite part of Germany. She married an ss officer from Hitler's staff. He died in combat a year later. By April 1945 no one writes love letters to the Fuhrer. As Berlin burns and the Soviet army closes in, Hitler hides in his underground bunker. Secretary Traudl Junge is down here with him. Frau Junge, what was Hitler's health in April 1945? His health was very bad. For years he had been taking medicines, drugs and injections. During his last days he had a constant tremor in his hands. And in front of strangers I think he was a little ashamed of his affliction and would try to hide it. As the Soviets fight their way into Berlin, Hitler refuses to accept the war is lost. He is attended in the bunker by more than a dozen generals, adjutants and aides de camp. Twice a day he calls a military conference in an airless room where only he is permitted to sit. One of the military men trapped with Hitler is baron von Loringhoven. He's an aristocrat with the rank of major but has never joined the Nazi party. He has a wife and young son and has come to regard Hitler as insane. Baron Loringhoven, how large was the map room in which you held your conferences? It was about three by four meters, and with 15 people crowded into it, the atmosphere was stifling. But what did you have to discuss? The war was lost. Yes, but no one dared to mention defeat to Hitler. To do so one could lose one's life. In addition, one's entire family would be jeopardized. He still kept up his hopes by hinting at secret weapons and of dissensions between the allies. One and a half million Soviet soldiers begin entering Berlin. The German defenders are outnumbered three to one. They know that the war is lost. But Hitler has been losing his grip on reality for weeks. The bunker is within range of the Soviet guns, yet he still thinks he can fight back. Heinz lorenz is the Fuhrerbunker's press attache. He's been part of Hitler's inner circle throughout the war and often sits up late with the Fuhrer talking and drinking tea. Mr. Lorenz, I should like to have you tell me the most impressive moments that you associate with Hitler. Well, there were two such moments. The first occurred April 12th, when I brought him the news that Roosevelt, the president of the United States, had passed away. From his beloved second home at Warm Springs, Georgia, the body of Franklin Delano Roosevelt moves on the first stages of its journey to his final resting place. Hitler went into a dance and congratulated himself as if he had himself brought about this event. He exclaimed, "this will mean I will win the war. This is our victory." Ten days later, the other event occurred, and this time his feelings went to the other extreme. The Red Army Juggernaut rolls into the northern part of Berlin. The only defense here is a ragtag collection of inexperienced units. Hitler orders them to attack the Soviets, warning that the fate of the German capital is in their hands. It's a suicide mission, and Hitler's soldiers refuse. His armies were defeated on all fronts and Berlin was threatened. He ordered his troops forward, to stop the advance, but the troops failed to attack. The shock of realization that he, Adolf Hitler, had been disobeyed and that complete disaster was inevitable was too much for him. He collapsed and he said, "it's all over and I'll shoot myself." For over a decade Hitler has been, in the eyes of his followers, an invincible demi-god. Now his inner circle are stunned by this announcement. Secretary Traudl Junge sees him moments later. Did you ever hear him mention suicide? Yes, after April the 22nd, he talked about it constantly, in order that there should be no doubt about his death. He made plans to take poison and at the same time shoot himself with his pistol. Hitler orders his safe emptied and the contents burned. He also removes his walther ppk pistol from the safe and sits with it staring at a portrait of Frederick the great, the prussian king who also vowed to kill himself when the Russians threatened Berlin. What was your attitude regarding Hitler's intention to commit suicide? I told him if he intended to die, the place to die would be in battle leading his troops. But he said he feared that he might only be wounded and captured, and then the Russians would degrade him. Did he expect others to commit suicide with him? Yes, Eva Braun. Eva Braun first met Hitler in 1929 when she was 17 and working for a Nazi party photographer. Although 23 years younger than him, Braun has been Hitler's mistress for 14 years, but the relationship is being kept hidden from the German people. Hitler wants to remain attractive to his female admirers and has groomed Braun to refrain from public displays of affection. Their private life together in the bunker is confined to a few small concrete rooms. They sleep separately. She's here in the bunker against Hitler's wishes, but refuses to leave. Braun's family do not approve of her affair with the Fuhrer. Her sister, Ilse Braun, knew that Eva's relationship with Hitler was doomed. Madam Braun, what was Hitler's health like when you last saw him? His face was gray as ashes, his hands were in a constant state of agitation, and his eyes were glassy. He was kind of like an old man. It seemed to me he didn't have the energy to live much longer. To those who knew details of Braun and Hitler's relationship, it's no surprise she wanted to die with him. Mrs. Winter, how long did you keep house for Hitler? 15 years. Of course, Eva Braun was a regular visitor. There was a time where Eva Braun wanted Hitler to marry her. Hitler said, "I shall never marry... ...but you may remain my girlfriend." She was very unhappy over this situation and attempted suicide. She shot herself in the breast, but she did not seriously injure herself. As Hitler and Eva Braun contemplate ending their lives, a powerful influence in the reich tells them to wait. Joseph Goebbels, the Nazi propaganda minister, is the Fuhrer's most fanatical follower. He persuades Hitler not to take his life... yet. Rather, he says, use his willingness to face death to inspire Germany to fight on to the end. Goebbels will make a radio broadcast announcing that the Fuhrer will "die fighting with his troops defending Berlin." Then the propaganda minister brings his family into the bunker. His six children, five girls and a boy, call Hitler "uncle Adolf." His wife magda is a fanatical Nazi. The Goebbels have been presented to Germany as the third reich's model family. Now they will be at the Fuhrer's side in his final hour as an example to all Germans. It becomes apparent that the Goebbels children have no change of clothes. And then the Nazi propaganda minister and his wife make a horrifying announcement. Goebbels and Mrs. Goebbels announced they didn't want to live after the Fuhrer had gone, and so they talked all day long on how they were going to die. Minister Goebbels and his wife arranged to have their six children poisoned as well. Frau Goebbels declares that she does not wish her children to live in a world without national socialism. The rank atmosphere in the bunker is recharged with Nazi fervor. Generals Krebs and Burgdorf announce that they, too, will die with the Fuhrer. He was passing around poison vials. Did you get one? No, I wasn't within the immediate entourage, nor had I any desire to paint my lips. Well, what do you mean by that? The poison was contained in a receptacle which looked like a lipstick, and those who received them regarded them as a great treasure. Conversation in the bunker is dominated by the idea of suicide, but some people reject the notion. Major johannmeier is Hitler's army adjutant. He's a veteran of the Russian front and won the iron cross for bravery. Major johannmeier, did you receive one of the poison vials which Hitler distributed according to the testimony of other witnesses? No, I was a soldier and did not want to die by poison. I wanted to fight, and if I had to die, die honorably. But Hitler allows no one to leave the bunker without his permission, and few believe they're going to get out alive. 30 feet above the bunker in the ruins of Berlin, thousands of Germans are already dead. The red army has completely encircled the city and meets up with the U.S. troops in the west. General eisenhower, supreme commander of the allied forces, has agreed to let the Soviets take Berlin. They want Hitler alive, and as they fight their way to the Fuhrerbunker street by street, they're calling it the biggest manhunt in history. Hitler tries one last desperate tactic to save himself. 50 miles to the southwest of Berlin is the 12th German army commanded by general Wenck. It faces the American advance on the river elbe. Hitler orders Wenck and his 70,000 men to reverse course and come to his aid. Hitler hoped that Wenck's army would break through to relieve Berlin. Where was Wenck? On the elbe. He stormed ahead with a few troops as far as potsdam, but he was hopelessly outnumbered and out-equipped. The Soviet bombardment now homes in on Hitler's position. Shells land so close to the bunker, it shakes, filling the air and covering surfaces with concrete dust. The lights frequently fail. Each day Hitler takes tea and crumpets with his secretary. And each day he demands to know when Wenck will come. But unknown to Hitler, Wenck has disobeyed the order to relieve Berlin and is instead helping civilians flee. Nonetheless, each day Hitler wanted to know where Wenck was. But, baron, hadn't Hitler already decided to die? Yes. But he wanted to live. He loved power like a miser loves gold. For five days Hitler clings to the delusion that his army will relieve Berlin. Baron von Loringhoven's duty is to provide the Fuhrer with intelligence updates, but the bunker is now cut off from radio contact with the military. He resorts to using a Berlin telephone directory to call addresses in the city. If a Russian voice answers, he knows that sector is taken. If it's German he asks them to look out of the window and tell him what's happening. By April 28th, the Russians are less than 550 yards from the bunker. Hitler still clings on. Then he receives news that changes everything. Heinrich Himmler, head of the ss and the second most powerful man in the reich, has betrayed him. From the relative safety of German occupied territory in the north, he's trying to negotiate peace with the Americans. The news is picked up via bulletin on the BBC world service, now virtually the only contact Hitler's staff has with the outside world. Now, baron Loringhoven, just when did Hitler abandon all hope? When Hitler heard that Himmler had tried to surrender to the western powers, he raged and declared that never would a traitor succeed him as Fuhrer. Hitler orders Himmler's representative in the bunker, general fegelein, to be shot. Fegelein is Eva Braun's brother-in-law, married to her pregnant sister. Hitler's mistress begs for his life, but the plea is refused. Then Hitler begins dictating his final will and political testament to Traudl Junge. He starts by blaming the Jews for the war. He dictated it to me the night of April 28th. And, I must frankly say, that the will was very disappointing. I thought that in it he would try to justify what he has done and why Germany found itself in its present situation so that he might offer to show some way out of our horrible tragedy. But he repeated the same old arguments he had used over and over in all his speeches. The will also reveals that Hitler is prepared to give his mistress what she's always craved. Although never mentioning her by name, it states that in return for her loyalty and willingness to die with him, he will at last marry Eva Braun. Just over an hour after executing her brother-in-law, Hitler emerges from his room with Eva Braun on his arm. She wears a black sequined dress. Her eyes are radiant with happy tears. Hitler wears his usual tunic. Goebbels acts as best man in the hastily arranged ceremony, and the bride and groom, adhering to the legal requirements of a Nazi wedding, both declare that they are "of pure Aryan descent and free from hereditary disease." As Eva signs the wedding certificate, she writes the letter "b" for Braun, before scoring it out and writing "Hitler." What happened at the end? He married Eva Braun and prepared for his suicide. Was there a wedding celebration? There was a little party and they drank champagne. Hitler did not drink any champagne, because he was dictating his will. Hitler returns to dictating his will, stating that he and his new wife will take their lives rather than face the shame of defeat and surrender. Their bodies are to be burned. It also urges his successors to continue the fight. The documents are to be couriered out of the bunker through Soviet lines to territories still held by Germany. When did you last see Adolf Hitler? The morning of April 29th. He directed me to take a copy of his will to field marshal schorner and emphasized the importance of the mission. What was the atmosphere of that last conversation with Hitler? We both realized we would never see each other again. Was there any doubt in your mind that he was going to die? None whatsoever. Having married Eva Braun and written his last will and political testament urging his followers to continue the fight, all Adolf Hitler has left to do is take his life. Now in his final hours, the Fuhrer's paranoia reaches new heights in the claustrophobic bunker. What was Hitler's mood during this period? He was depressed and suspicious of everybody. He even now suspected that the poison would only make him unconscious and he would be turned over alive to the allies. So he decided to test the poison. On whom did he test the poison? On his best friend. Namely? Blondi. Who was blondi? His dog. What was the result of the test? The dog died. Trapped in the bunker with him, his staff know the reign of the Fuhrer will soon be over. Hitler moved about like a living dead man. He couldn't bear to be alone, and he walked around from person to person. Before, everybody had an awe of him. Now he incited no fear or sensation. The people in the bunker even smoked... something no one had dared to do in 12 years in his presence. Even Eva Braun, who had never smoked before, puffed at a cigarette on that day. The bombardment of Berlin intensifies. The bunker sewage pipes rupture and the toilets overflow, filling the corridor and the rooms with the reek of urine. The generals get drunk. The bunker became a mortuary, and the people in it living corpses. The atmosphere was very depressing and surreal, and I had no desire to remain. If I was going to die, I preferred death on the battlefield as a soldier. How did you get out of the bunker? I asked my superior officer, general Krebs, if I could try to join general Wenck's army still in the field. He got Hitler's permission, I saluted and left. What was Hitler's demeanor as you actually left? He had a collected and concentrated expression as if he had closed everything and was no more interested in minor people like ourselves. A British radio broadcast is picked up in the bunker late on the evening of April the 29th describing the fate of Hitler's ally, the Italian fascist dictator Mussolini. Milan was in a state of the wildest excitement at about this time, for partisans had just killed Mussolini. The bodies of the ex-dictator, his mistress and fellow fascists were left lying in the square, and the enraged Italians took the opportunity of kicking them and flinging rubbish on them. The final ghastly scene was the hanging of the bodies upside down outside a petrol station. Well, at least it's a warning to all remaining fascists everywhere. Did Hitler hear of the death of Mussolini? Yes, he did, and I think that this unnerved him more than anything else. He had a great fear that if captured, dead or alive, his body would be exposed to ridicule and degradation. In the early hours of April 30th, Hitler orders an assembly of the Fuhrerbunker staff. Baroness Irmengard von Varo is a German aristocrat sheltering in the bunker from the red army. Now she volunteers as a waitress. About 2:30 in the morning I was awakened and instructed to report to the Fuhrer's rooms. My eyes heavy with sleep, I made my way underground to the corridor in the Fuhrerbunker. I saw a strange figure. It looked like a ghost. I saw it was Hitler. He was absolutely shrunken. He was hanging in his clothes. His eyes were glaring into emptiness. His hands were shaking like leaves in a storm. Hitler thanks his staff for their loyal service. He shook hands with each one of us like an old man going to his grave. And then he said goodbye to all of us. I made some foolish remarks about keeping up courage, but I am sure he did not hear me or pay any attention. And then dragging his feet, he slowly went out. The Soviets are 220 yards away. Hitler is informed that the Fuhrerbunker will be breached at any moment. He attempts to step outside, but the shelling is too intense. A conference is held. There is nothing to say. Hitler instructs his adjutant Otto Gunsche to procure enough gasoline to ensure that his and his wife's bodies are incinerated. Tell us about the 30th. We had lunch together, Hitler, Eva Braun and myself. There was an attempt at normal conversation, but everybody could feel the presence of death. Hitler is vegetarian, and the last meal he and Eva Braun eat is spaghetti with cabbage and raisin salad. How did Eva Braun take all this business of dying? She loved the Fuhrer, and she was willing to die with him. But still, she loved life. She was a very lively person and had a great spirit of good living. Once she had agreed to die with Hitler, I think she was like a child in the dark. She asked Hitler, "will it hurt? I don't mind dying heroically, but it must be painless." And she laughed, but it was not laughter which comes from the heart. What did Hitler say to this? Oh, he went into details. He said, "the immediate effect of the poison will be a paralyzation of the respiratory tissues and then of the heart. Death will occur only after a few minutes, but the pains will cease after a few seconds, for then the tissue convulsions occur." Eva Braun changes. She chooses Hitler's favorite dress, black with white roses around the neck. She does her hair and paints her nails. After lunch I retired in one of the rooms. At about 2:30, Gunsche, who was Hitler's ss adjutant, called me out to the corridor. Here I saw Hitler with Eva Braun on his arm giving his final farewell. I was the last person to whom he offered his hand. It was very limp. He looked at me, but I don't think he saw me. I don't think he saw anybody. Hitler and his wife retire to their rooms. Magda Goebbels, the Nazi propaganda minister's wife and mother of his six children, appears at Hitler's door. For days she shut herself away in her room. Now she demands to see Hitler. The adjutant relents and knocks. Hitler opens the door, and frau Goebbels bursts into a desperate plea. She knows that when the Fuhrer dies she will have to carry out her vow to not only kill herself, but also poison her children, and implores Hitler to escape and live on. Hitler's refusal is brusque. No one will see the Fuhrer alive again. Artur axmann, leader of the Hitler Youth, arrives. He joined the Nazi party at 15 and started the first Hitler Youth group to indoctrinate children and teenagers into national socialism. He's recruited thousands of boys as young as 12 to defend Berlin, and they are taking heavy casualties. He's here for his daily conference with the Fuhrer. I arrived there at about 3 o'clock in the afternoon. I went to his room, but the door was closed, and Gunsche, his ss adjutant, was standing outside. He motioned me to silence, and I went back to the conference room and waited with Goebbels. The bombardment above resumes with renewed intensity. The bunker personnel wait for the Fuhrer to finally carry out the act he's been threatening for the last eight days. Suddenly I thought of the Goebbels children. My heart went out in sympathy to them because I knew they were marked for death, too. And I was afraid that just in that moment the children would want to see him. I knew that at any moment now Hitler would take his life. And that, captain Musmanno, was the shot which finished Adolf Hitler. Goebbels and I ran back to Hitler's room and entered it. We found Eva Braun sitting on the sofa, her head resting on Hitler's left shoulder. She wore a black chiffon dress. She was dead, but she had no marks of violence on her body. She died of poison. Hitler's lower jaw was slightly distorted. It was obvious he had shot himself in the mouth. On either side of his temples I saw drops of blood. The blast of the pistol had ruptured the veins on either side of his head. The sofa was stained with blood, and his pistol lay at his feet. I remained with the corpses about 10 minutes, then I returned to the conference room. And from this point saw Hitler's and Eva Braun's bodies being carried out of the bunker. But for Hitler's staff there is still one more ordeal to come. For 12 years Adolf Hitler was leader of Nazi Germany. For six years he inflicted the chaos and catastrophe of a global war that claimed 55 million lives. Now Hitler lies dead by his own hand. The third reich is over. In accordance with his orders, the bodies of Hitler and his wife are to be burned. His staff must get them outside. Erich kempka, the Fuhrer's chauffeur since 1934, carries Eva Braun. Mr. Kempka, please tell us about the events of April 30th. I turned over Eva Braun's body to Gunsche. And he laid it down next to Hitler's corpse. Hitler and Braun's bodies are laid in a shell crater. Nearly 50 gallons of gasoline lie waiting at the bunker exit. We then picked up the cans and poured gasoline over both bodies. Fuhrerbunker guard hermann karnau approaches the scene. Hitler was wrapped up in a blanket, which had opened up. And I saw his face covered with blood. All the time the Russian artillery were shelling the reich chancellery. We had to take shelter in the concrete entrance to the bunker. Here Gunsche lighted a rag... And threw it to the bodies. Both bodies were in full flame when I left. Hermann karnau has kept watch over the funeral pyre for the last two hours. The bodies were still burning... And the flesh moved up and down. I touched the burning remains, which were lying before me with my feet, and they fell apart. Almost frozen, I remained fixed to the spot, and lifted my arm in salute. The incinerated remains of Adolf Hitler and Eva Braun are buried in the shell crater. This is London calling. Here is a news flash. The German radio has just announced that Hitler is dead. I repeat that: The German radio has just announced that Hitler is dead. 24 hours later, Soviets enter and loot the deserted Fuhrerbunker. They find the charred remains of Goebbels and his wife. They've shot themselves and their bodies have been burned. They also find the bodies of the six poisoned Goebbels children. The Soviets dig up what's left of Adolf Hitler and Eva Braun and identify the Fuhrer using his dental records. No one is certain what happened to the remains, and they are never shown to the western powers. Stalin, the Russian dictator, suggests Hitler escaped Berlin and is still alive. The rumor marks the beginning of the mistrust and disinformation that will define the coming cold war. By the time captain Musmanno concludes his investigation in 1948, there has been no trace of Hitler for three years. There can be no doubt that Adolf Hitler, the Fuhrer of Germany, the master criminal of the world, the greatest gangster who ever disgraced the human race, is dead! Michael Musmanno's interview footage is never seen by the public. He sends a copy to Hollywood, but the mood of the western world has changed. It wants to forget Hitler and the war and instead look forward to a brighter new future. The film is only rediscovered in Duquesne university, Pittsburgh, in 2013. Today the site of the Fuhrerbunker in Berlin, where Hitler died and his body was burned, is a car park.
