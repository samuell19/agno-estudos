The auspicious time is nearing. Where is Hayavadana? Go and get him quickly! I wonder where he's stuck! Where is Hayavadana? It's getting late for the wedding ceremony. Gundanna asked me to bring him right away. He can't. He won't. It'll smell. He's chugged two pegs of raw booze. After scolding him, he must be having it diluted with water. What does the bride do? She's finished college and is working. - What about the groom? - He runs Raghavendra stores. Who was the guy sitting next to the hotel supplier? That was the groom's brother. He works in a bank. I'm okay with him. The supplier looks a lot older. If the younger one does it and the older one doesn't, won't he feel bad? Being his father, how do I tell him the news? I'm okay with you. But how do I tell this to brother? I like your younger brother and the job he's doing. Can't say the same about you and your profession. Hayavadana... If the girl had said yes to you, it would be you on this bed. The bed's leg is faulty. Try staying on the other end. ♪ This abode bears the name of Saint Raayaru!

He spoke of spongy Idlies, Vadays with hole, Puffed Poori, Dosay spread on the tawa topped with butter. You shouldn't misconstrue his words. Please leave! Please sit. What would you like to have?! - A Vaday with a hole. - I'll be back in two minutes. You have desires, but aren't ready to get married. You can't rock the cradle without tying the knots. Remember, you're at the penultimate stage of your youth... Trip it and there'll be a baby bump. Reduce your trips to the hotel until you get married. Listen, women of today won't accept a caterer or a hotelier or a baker as their groom. You just hit the forties. Try to understand. Hotels, bakery and catering are no menial jobs. Years ago, men would degrade cooking. Today, educated girls and women do the same. As much as a working man is important for a family... A woman who runs the kitchen is equally important. If you degrade the art of cooking, a mother's cooking would hold no value. A man can be satisfied only with food. The woman who marries me, should value my profession. ♪ Hey Bachelor!

You too were a party worker at first. How dare you raise your hands on one?! Now, I will place my hands over you. Try hitting me now. You... take a picture. Look over there. Not a single person is here by the photo of the dead. But the entire town's here to console his wife. What can I do? For the last twelve days, everyone wants me to cry. Be it the party member or the media, I should cry in front of them all. How much can I cry? Madam, the media's waiting for you. Hayavadana... Go on. When the husband's alive and the wife cries, the husband is the villain. When the husband's gone and the wife doesn't cry, the wife is villain. Are you contesting the by-elections this time? Madam, let me handle this. Don't you have any sensitivity? She's not interested in politics. She doesn't want a ticket. She needs peace. Let's go Madam. Come on guys. Looking at her, I feel like giving her a new lease of life. You're still willing it. Kogile (Cuckoo) has already given his banana. Dammit! Madam, don't worry that your husband isn't here any more. We're here for you. We'll take your leave now. Bless you. MLA Ramakanth was an influential leader of our community. Yes. He would take up all the responsibilities on his shoulders. From now on, I wonder how we'll manage to run this school and Ashrama. Don't worry about the Ashrama and the Mutt. I thought only the kids would be endangered from now. I didn't know it would be the same case with the Mutt and the Swamiji. Yes. I mean it. I don't know if I'll be able to do as much as Mr. Ramakanth who was in power. But I'll do everything I possibly can, Swamiji. For someone who is childless like me, the children of this Ashrama are now my own. Take a proper picture. Get a close-up. Donates clothes for a photo op. Comes back only to take them all away. Everything he does is for publicity, madam. He buys one tailoring machine and claims to donate it to ten women. He doesn't give the machine to anybody. He claims to fast in front of the media. But orders food and eats it away from their eyes. Until he turns into a portrait forever, this madness won't stop. Thanks of his tyranny, there's dearth of two timely meals in this Ashrama. The kids and I now live in the fear of losing out on that too. The only source of joy these kids have is... The food from Raghavendra Stores. If there's left over food from other functions, they bring it here. Neither do they act like they're doing us a favour. Nor do they look down upon the kids as they don't have anywhere else to go. They come here purely out of love for the kids. Not to use them for publicity like him. - Careful. - Mr. Kumar... Make sure the kids eat. Dessert has been prepared for them. - Dessert? - No need, Swamiji. There's food waiting at the Ashrama. Let them eat there or else food will go waste. Argh! - Let the kids learn the value of food. - As you wish. Let good things happen. - They shouldn't get used to such luxury, right? - Yes, Sir. The only time you'll taste dessert is at his funeral. Let's go. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] The light and the storm are both yours May the light never be put out What happened? Somebody turn on the generator. Son-in-law tends to get handsy. He might get cosy with the daughter. I told you so. He can't control his hands. Son-in-law, kindly control your urges until tomorrow. You're in Karnataka, savouring Kannada's rice and sambar, drinking Kaveri water. All we did was demand a Kannada song... How dare you sing random songs? - What do you think of yourself? - Dude! Dumbo! She sang a Kannada song. They think only cinema songs are Kannada songs! Rogues! - Go and check what's wrong! - Listen... I only sing poetry, folk songs and old film songs. I don't sing new Kannada film songs. If you don't sing one now, my friend will not get married tomorrow. - You better sing one now! - Madam, I beg you... Just sing! Or else our troupe's reputation will get screwed. - But I don't know any. - Sing it now! They want Pepsi instead of lemonade. I told them we're vegetarians and they want Kebabs. Who was it? These morons? - Are they friends of the groom? - Yes. These brats! - Look at us! - AYE! Brother, it was them. Where the hell is Pepsi-Kebab? Can't you eat with your own money? Does it have to be from the bride's father's account? Why are you diverting us? You sing a Kannada song now! Patience! - You want a trending song, right? - Yes! - I will sing one! - She has to sing! Let me sing for you! Madam, give me a hand. Everyone calm down! Quit staring at and give me the microphone. They'll have it now! Check check! How are you? Meet me later. Check check! Chuck! - Get over with it! - Kindly shut it! Mic check! Madam, kindly get to C Minor. With you.. here begins my fable I've lived every line in it, to the fullest My fable... begins with you Watch the wire! For it has created another world of ours This has never happened before - What does all of this mean? - Let's go! You complete me, and I complete you The rest of my life is with you Brother, you're awesome! Enough now! - Take him away! - Please get going from here! Please return the Mic! Here's your Mic! Lady, sing whatever you like. God bless! Mic check! Whatsapp the images to me. Get lost! Take off that damn garland! Witnessing my superior talent, the groom made me wear his garland. He gave it to you so that you can stop the ugly singing! The reception was going so well for the last two hours. You ruined the last half an hour. Naysayers are always online. Fans however are offline. - Did everyone eat? - Everything got over. The orchestra troupe is yet to eat. After your singing, they're both out of food and opportunities. Artists should never leave on an empty stomach. Whip up some lemon rice and curd rice. Please eat your stomach's fill. Thanks to the entire troupe. For co-operating with my singing, my troupe co-operated for your food here. He's Horny Madhu. He's Kogile, but doesn't sing. Old Monk, Sabeena, BT. Myself Hayavadana. I'm Vyjayanthi. The lemon rice is delicious. So was your singing. Actually I... I wanted to take part in 'Sing from your heart' show. I couldn't. But now, even Balu (S P Balasubramaniam) is no more. - I love to croon with women. - Practice at home. You may try singing in a high pitch too. O' rich ornamental beauty. You're sole... Stop it! She asked you to practice it at home. Not in the damn vehicle! O' rich ornamental beauty. You're sole... Stop the vehicle. I'll walk. Try stopping the vehicle and you'll be eating scrapes. One can't help it if an underwear stinks. Blame the part it's covering. It's all our fate. O' rich ornamental beauty. You're sole... Do you call that a voice? It was an unbearable noise. [MIMICS CLASSICAL SINGING] What's up with the garland, Hayavadana? This was the result of my mesmerizing melodious singing. For you, I will sing the song- Filled with Melody - Uncle! - My dear. The kid will sleep with me. - You may begin. - It's just that... I might be unmarried. But I'm well versed with what the married ones do. Dear, do you want a brother or a sister? We'll get one for you. Namaskara Sir! Here's your coffee! On the President's birthday, we need to get 25 couples married. I've taken up that responsibility. Make a list of all those unmarried above the age of 35 years. - Okay sir. - Why bother, brother? He's right in front of you. - Maybe he's not interested. - He's not interested in marriage. - What about a girl? - Well. He's interested in that. - Listen, Kogile? - Huh? Come here. Want to get married? - Huh?! - A marriage? Poor Rathnamma is worried that her daughter is yet to get married. He might be able to bring down her worry. Take an elder person from home along with you and discuss the alliance with them. Go on. Just get going. I don't care if we get a woman abandoned by her husband or a widow remarried... We'll have to get 25 couples married. He is the one who needs to see and do things with the bride. Why me in between them? That is only if she accepts the alliance. You know the pain of old unmarried people. Do something and make this alliance happen. I'm not the groom. He is. It's him. Let's move places. - Who is he? - He is one of us. But he's the one to bump her up. Please have it. I need to talk to you. Come on now. Do something and make it happen. Let's go, sire. Looks like the hormones has been activated! Aye! What are you looking for down there? Hold your head up. Talk to her! - What is your name? - Well that... He's H.S. Manjunatha. We call him - Kogile. I didn't ask you. I asked him. You did. He can listen. Can't speak, can he? Go on! She wants you to talk. I've been speaking since then. You aren't saying a word. What the hell was that?! He likes you. He's asking what you think of him. Disgusting! What was that? Oh really?! He's saying that... He wants you to be able to cook and take care of his mother. Bloody hell! I can't tell her such things. If you cut the vegetables and grate the coconut in the curry, ...his mother might end up wheezing. I get what he's saying. Why are you sitting here like an uninvited guest? Aren't you ashamed? - Get up and leave! - I deserved this, didn't I? Ask your friend to leave! All the outburst right after he liked the girl. This is the power of a woman. Did you ask me to stay? Moron made me leave. - Hello? - Are they still not done talking? Let me check. - Hello? - What's happening, son? The talks have reached the final stage. They're talking their hearts out. They'll be there soon. Congratulations brother! I don't get it man. I told her repeatedly that he can't speak. She hardly reacted to it. How will she react? She's deaf. She managed to keep it in without letting you know. Hayavadana finally turned into a third umpire. Congratulations Kogile! Congrats! You shaped the life of the man who couldn't speak. You don't have a flower with you. Yet he gets to wear the garland. The perfect couple! He can't speak and she can't listen. If the two get married, there won't be any differences. The ideal couple of this land. If you'd gotten married in time, your kids would be in school and college. Your father can sense random men in the town being in heat, ...but couldn't figure out that his own son is burning on a stove. After your mother passed away, your father turned a loner. After he's gone, you'll remain a loner. I managed to bring 24 couples together in your hotel. Your father asked me to find someone for Kogile, but never mentioned you. In life, one needs companionship. Together you need to leave a legacy behind. If you continue to live like this, young widows are all you'll be left with. An intoxicating feeling that makes me feel like a berserk tusker O' Lord of deception who deceived me of a female elephant ...that could get rid of this intoxication Life has turned into a lavatory, living in a void Having lost half of my youth with my hand, it has now given up Silence me and break this grasp; offer me a place in your palm, O' Lord! HAYAVADANA! Stop it! You made me stop myself all these days and I'm now uncontrollable. It's all in my fate! Ask for anything and I'll get you. I beg you. Please don't sing. Who got you into singing? - Are you even a father?! - What the hell did you drink? I drank this cheap and best, extraordinary booze. Are you even a father? A wastrel is all you are! - Go ask your mother! - If only... If mother was alive, would she have let me be like this? She would've got my fate interlocked with a woman's. Here you are! A good-for-nothing father! How will you understand my pain? O' mother! Why are you reminding me of her? We started our lives in this very hotel, together. She would chop and I would grind. Uncle! Who's this nonsense? Kiddo! You go inside. What are you staring at?! Take her inside. Get back in there. You've got everything now. All these years, he would put the kid to sleep with a performance. Looks like his performance woke the kid up. He's married and yet he's still hungry for more. Imagine how hungry I must be. Didn't you ever realise that? A son can ask his father to buy him a motorbike or a car. How can I shamelessly ask you for a girl? Just because a girl rejected me, does it mean that the entire world has rejected me? I will not hear any more excuses! I don't care if she's a maid. I want a girl at any cost! Making me wait for the auspicious planetary movement, ...looks like I'm losing movement in all the important areas. O' dear! Astrologer?! - Hurry up! - Quiet! Forgive us Mr. Astrologer. Quiet now! We were in a hurry. Please be seated. I need to hurry too. [RECITING MORNING PRAYERS] - Namaskara! - They're reeking. Disgusting. They're here without even washing their faces. There's an unbearable stink in the living room. Brush your teeth and come in. Take this. - Don't drink that shit from next time. - You drank it too. - How is his fortune now, Sir? - Greetings! There's no age left in him to keep a tab on his fortune. Will he be happy after marriage? Which soul on this planet is happy after marrying? Send us some coffee. I don't give a damn if I end up on the streets. I have to get married. - Fine! Ruin yourself! - As you wish. Take a chance in the name of God and get him married. Whether the girl's dusky or chubby, just go ahead. What say? Your coffee. - I'm ready for anything. - You go inside. Her wedding has already been arranged. You'll be catering the food. Take the place of her brother and make this marriage happen. That is all I've done all my life Brother, Hayavadana and Subbalakshmi grew up together in this house. Let their kids also grow up in this house. Let's get them married. I'm in love with someone. Please don't tell anyone about it. Tell them you don't want this marriage. Please? Please? Really? What's her native? Is it a good one? This isn't about your chick. I'm talking about Chikoo. For the hotel. Ten kilograms of Chikoo, please. I'm looking for a bride for Hayavadana. - What about your daughter...? - I'll let you know by evening. They'll let us know in the evening. - What is it now? - Did you get a call from them? I won't. You said no to your aunt's daughter. Suffer! But why? They asked me to send your photographs on Whatsapp. - I did. Then they blocked me. - Really?! His face looks like a bad photograph on an identity card. There is a prospective bride. She's beautiful both at looks and soul. She's intelligent too. If you take her in to your family, it'll turn into a beautiful haven. The girl has no demands. You only have to take care of her kid with her. Sire, please let us know if there's an empty plot. Not an already constructed building. We shall inaugurate the property. Thinks he can tie an aunty to me. What's wrong, Gundanna? You look worried? All Hayavadana was worried about before was Idly and Dosay batter. Some rascal has gotten him into thinking only about women. He's harrowing me to get him married. Why are you scolding him? He's ageing too... He is old already, Kumara! If you have any loyalty for all the food you've had in this hotel. Go find him a bride! You're here to see the girl. Be brave and take a look. Well... Let's just sit and talk. - Are you here just to talk? - This one's crazy! I asked for a bride so that he can have a family. Not to show off. Our family needs a cultured girl. She needs to be a devoted and cultured girl. Fine! I'll take him myself this time. When do we go? I can't wait any more. She looks like a parrot. - I'm okay with the girl. - You haven't even seen the bride. - Who's she? - The bride's aunt. Hello? Bhama is calling you inside. - Get going. - When the time's tough, she'll do too. Is your name on the Voters' list? Krishna? Krishna? The Supreme soul! What took you so long to meet me? Come here, Krishna! Come to me! Why are you standing there? Come to me, Krishna. Looks like she thinks I'm Krishna and will gobble me up. Krishna! Come here. I've waited all these years and have become so lean. Come here, Krishna! - Come here, Krishna! - Take it easy. Sit down. You're so beautiful, Krishna. Krishna! Show some mercy! She's desperate for a husband and has gone bonkers praying for one! - I don't want anything to do with her. - Mr. Hayavadana?! I'm okay with someone who looks like her. Find one for me. - Hayavadana stop! - Dammit! What kind of a woman was she?! Brother, maybe he liked the aunt more. Girijamma! Please call the girl. Pavitra! Come here. Wait.. The power's gone. Girls don't like me in broad daylight. Why will she like me in the dark? Won't she think I'm a monster? Look at the girl. She's here. Is it? Why are you looking at me like that? Why are you swaying and looking at me? You look the forest nightingale. You look good in the dark too. - Can you see me in the dark? - Yes. - I'm okay with marrying you. - Same here. Found the 25th couple for the collective wedding ceremony. The girl's star is 'Moola'. The bride and the groom will have a happy marriage. But the groom's father or mother will suffer. - No need then! - Isn't there a solution for this? Nope. Father, aren't you already 75? Which mongrel told you to kill your father to become one? Hayavadana, there's no bride left for you in this city. Your father won't like your choice. You won't like your father's choice. Let the collective wedding ceremony take place. - There's a girl in Kundapura. - As you wish. - Why are you struggling since then? - Something is pricking me since then. Some thing is pricking me too. Do you see me complaining? Sabeena. I'm done cooking desserts in others' wedding. I wonder when I get to taste my own. The groom's father is appearing more than the groom himself. The photographers too are stuck with him. He is the groom of this wedding. The man has a 40*60 plot on his head. He manages to find a bride for himself. Yet we don't find any. Look at the bride and speak. Don't just condemn the groom. A cabbage is being matched with a flower. Poor woman! She kept singing that both the light and storm are yours. Looks like her wind blew away. Women don't mind bearing their husband being jobless, shameless or an impotent. They won't bear it if he's hairless. Look at the irony! - Subbi? - Hayavadana? What are you doing here? Why do you look dull? Who side are you on? The groom's or the bride's? The groom was on my side. I said no to you, for him. What?! We were in love for eight years. He's ten years older than me. I don't feel bad because you said no to me. I feel horrible because you said no to me for him. [VOICE MESSAGE] If my mother finds out, Doctor says the commotion will kill my mother I can't hurt my mother nor do I wish to hurt you. I can't be the reason for her death. My mother won't make it past six months. I don't need this guilt This marriage is just for my mother. I don't like the girl either. I've loved you for ten years. I would never cheat on you. Please try to understand me. I love you, Subbi. There she is... My lover's mother. If things were better, she would be the only one to go. If the matter gets out now, a lot of bodies will be found. If this wedding takes place, I will kill myself. Like I told you, a lot of bodies will roll. Kogile, keep feeding her the dessert. I'll be back in no time. I wonder what spell this man cast on Subbi. She's enchanted beyond repair. Who want some Idly? - Thick chutney or the watery chutney? - Watery chutney. Thick chutney is all there is. - Coffee or Tea? - Coffee. There's no coffee. Only tea. Pour some. Listen! I don't love any other girl. - Do I look the type? - Actually, you don't. But the voice message confirmed it. [VOICE MESSAGE] Please understand, Subbi. My mother won't accept a girl from another caste. The doctor has told that she won't make it past six months. I don't like this marriage either. I'll marry her and then divorce her. I'll even compensate her for it. We can then live together. Please trust me, Subbi. Madam, feel free not to marry and join the Mutt. But please don't marry this wastrel! - Namaskara! - Put the things over there. If I open my mouth, her soul will fly away. Let this soul not be lost because of me. Say the chants. It's your wedding. I don't seem to get the feeling. Amma, I don't want this marriage. What the hell are you saying? I'm not okay with this marriage. Amma! Amma? Move aside! Where did that lady go? Don't worry. I called an ambulance in case of an emergency. The driver called. She's doing fine. Don't worry, Madam. You'll be alive until you make it to the hospital. What's this, brother? Usually it would be a single dish. How come there's so many dishes this time? The wedding got called off. Mind your business and eat. Breakfast was very good. I was the one who referred you for catering this wedding. That was my only choice. Brother, the dessert was too good. Is this why you referred him to cook for this wedding? There's no perfect man in this world. If not now, you'll not get married in this lifetime. I'll come back to work from this week. Send me the list of songs. I'm cancelling my leaves. Brother, it's finally time for our Kogile to do the singing. Madam, the arrangements are on-point. Play the band! Tie the knots! Why did he leave? Is he pissed off that Kogile too is now married? He's not disturbed because Kogile got married. He is upset that her wedding got cancelled. Wedding? [CHANTING PRAYERS] Namaste Ms. Alamelamma! - Ms. Alamelamma? - Huh? Ms. Alamelamma - You look beautiful in this saree. - Who's this old hag? He's stuck behind me. Dear Lord! - Ms. Alamelamma! - God, please save me. Stop for a minute, please! - Ms. Alamelamma! - Oh god! Please open the door. Aren't you ashamed to be following me around in this age? What can I possibly do in this age? I'm here to discuss the kids' future. Please open the door. Please try to understand. Oh! I've sorted everything out, okay? No matter how busy you are, drop everything. Get to Chitradurga right away. Vyjayanthi... - Please forgive me. - Amma... I've set up Vyjayanthi's mother. You go and set things right with Vyjayanthi! This is your last chance. Go for it and you'll tie the knots. Or else, your youth will remain untied. Look, your co-singer is here. Please don't make him sing. Or else, we won't get any work in our town either. A wedding without finding the auspicious time? You tried it before, didn't you? How did that go? You don't look like you're forty years old. You look very young. All the women around my house tell the same. Neither do you look thirty six. You seem like you're only thirty five. But you're very beautiful. We've spent half of our lifetime. The other half is all that is left. By now, we should've discussed about our children's future. Look at how our parents are discussing our future. Let's finish discussing about the gifts to be given. Oh no! You'll give us the bride and I'll give you the groom. Together, they'll give us a child. Isn't that all we want, Alamelamma? Late marriages aren't wrong. Early marriages and divorces are wrong. You're right. Just a tweet is all they take to absolve everything. No need to take the legal route. Did you have a first love? A couple of them pestered me. But they're all married now. - What about you? - Well... Except for love, I had the other offers. I had all the talent but never put it to use. I'm still a virgin. I swear on God! We'll have a simple marriage and not invite many people. Feel free to conduct a grand reception in your town. Stuck to the simple occasion and hooked me with the expensive affair! I wish to go to Shimla or Kashmir on our honeymoon. Well, I have a lot of dreams for the honeymoon too. I'm not particular about the location. Any place will do. It just has to happen. We're now a close family. Keep calling me when you're free. Fine. I will. When did you mother pass away? It's been twenty five years. I'll have to ask my mother to be careful. Stay in touch. I just have one condition. The wedding has to take place according to our traditions. Don't forget that, Gunda Bhattre. If my son was in a good condition, did I have to accept to all these conditions? Is everything ready? Almond milk and fruits? Everything is ready. Bear with it for two hours. The perfume, room freshener, mattress and sheets, are all new, right? Everything is brand new. Is the flower decoration done? Look at brother-in-law, he looks so good. If he had come on a horse, he would've looked better, right? He is racing forward like a horse himself. Sister, get ready for the race. Sir, after the reception, nobody will co-operate. Shall I take a couple of pictures now? If you come to me after the reception, your photo will be framed for good. No, sir. How about a great pose for me? Sir, this is horrible. Give me something else. This is good. Superb. Nice, sir. This is beautiful. Marvellous! - Sir, can you bend a little? - Will you join us? No, sir. Just for the photograph. For a pose. Now you're posing like a hero. This is mind blowing. Come closer and put you hand on the chest. On the chest? Sir, not you. Madam, you place your hand on his chest. Superb. This is nice. Next, come closer to each other and touch your foreheads. Come on. Just like that. - This is superb. - Just the foreheads, is it? That's all you can in front of the camera. This will do. Closer. Like that. We're done, sir. Do we need the reception? Let's escape. Shame on you! Thank you, sir. You may go to the stage. Is Kogile ready with everything? Call him and check. He can't speak and his wife can't listen. For what joy do I call him? You go ahead and get performing. I'll leave you then. Let's go. - Take care about the food arrangements. - Okay, sir. The rest of you can leave. - Bhattre! - Welcome Mr. Astrologer! - You get down here, Bhattre. - What is it? I sent you both of their horoscopes. Did you look at it? They'll be happy, right? You got them married without bothering about the auspicious hour. Their horoscopes have a lot of obstacles. It's the time of the union of eight planets. An important occasion. Don't let them get together in the next four days. Inauspicious planetary movements. Weak constellations. It'll worsen things in the future and their children will take birth with deformities. That is why I'm advising you. Make sure they don't get together for the next four days. - How do I stop a married man? - You have to. But, listen to me! Thank you. - Namaste, Hayavadana! - Namaste! Ready, Sir. What is this?! It doesn't feel right at all. Mr. Astrologer, may your blessings always be on us. It will be. Wait a minute! - Do anything but stop them. - But... How do I tell him? He's standing on the edge. If you don't, there won't be any edge to stand on. Let's leave soon. [MUTTERS] Congratulations, Hayavadana! I couldn't find anyone. You did it yourself. I was out on party work. Shall I wish you on the first night? I was just kidding man! Enjoy yourself! How do I enjoy with this hag in between?! Father, you won't let anything happen for four days. Let me sit next to her until we get home. No way! Enter the house with your right foot forward. Don't be in a hurry. Control yourself. Aren't you able to sleep? You got me my license but took away my car. You took the astrologer's words and stabbed me in the back. It's all about belief. When I was getting married to your mother, ...the astrologer told us that she won't live for long. It happened just like that. I'm just concerned that the same doesn't repeat with you. You've waited for forty years. Can't you control for four more days? Just because he's forgotten things, he expects me to do the same. It's all my ill-fate! I scheduled the worship a bit early. Looks like you didn't get to sleep. - Finish it soon. - In a hurry, are you? Weren't you in a hurry when you got married? Time for the main ritual. Bang the dong and the bell. [CHANTS MANTRAS] Pray for yourself! While the dong rings loud in everyone's houses, the bell in your house is louder. Take care of us god. Stand away, dear. Brother, were the arrangements good? Go ask my sister-in-law. They made use of it. Ms. Alamelamma, you could've stayed for a couple of days more, right? If your mother stays, you won't become a mother. If your father is still with us, neither will you become a father. - Have another Obbattu. - Is that why I got married? Everything is about that now! I'm getting adjusted to everything. Tell me. What is new with you? UNCLE! Come on, Uncle! Let's play. - Let's play. - It is you I want to play with! [WHISPERS] Come in! What is it? - We could've met in our room. - Your mother's in there. I'm your husband. Come sit with me. Sit down. It's only a matter of two more days, right? Listen, we'll have to enjoy the small things in life. What will we take with us when we leave this world? Four people will take us away, that is all. - Vyjayanthi... - Someone's here. - Let them come! - Sir?! Someone's really here. Ambuja, are you done with the work? You're not just sweeping this room, but my life away too. I'll deal with you later, wretched woman! Found her! Aunty! Will you make some Jamoon for me? How does this kid find us no matter where we go?! My brother tied this troublesome kid to me. - My cutiepie! - Grandpa! Well well well! It's all your doing, is it? Tell aunty to make some Jamoon. Make some Jamoon for this dried out Jamoon. Kindly, stuff your face with it! It's only been three days and my father got me here ...to ensure that I don't get together with my wife. You've been married only for two months and are three months pregnant. How is that possible? Looks like he dug in before the wedding. Listen, don't give a damn about these traditions. - You're already forty. - People have scored in their seventies. Do you plan to wait until the seventies? I'm not going to wait until the twentieth of this month. I've asked Vyjayanthi to go upstairs. Go to her. Subbi, you're a quick learner. Time for some dessert. Please forgive me. I'm really sorry. I have no regrets. My husband's head is filled with a lot of hair. You baldie! It has blossomed The shrunken lotus has blossomed Open the door, dear. I can't wait any more. - Let's take a nap together. - That's the last thing I need. The test match will end today. Twenty-twenty begins tomorrow. It's only going to be free-hits. Please catch them right. If they trouble me tomorrow, I won't care a damn! Be it in the living room or the kitchen or the wash room, it'll happen. - Which saree are you wearing tomorrow? - Will it matter? Father-in-law's here. If you send the kid to trouble me tomorrow, you'll be murdered. It'll be on the news tomorrow. 'Is this for real? A shaking bell?' Madhusudana will be going to his wife's house. Sister and I are going to Dharmasthala. Ms. Alamelamma will be returning home. Vyjayanthi, careful with the house. Okay. Sure. Really?! I can't bear it any more. - Mother-in-law's on the bus. - Bye Aunty! Your brother too left in the car. I've boarded the vehicle. You get on the bed. Father-in-law's still here. I'm in the auto rickshaw already. Bye. I'm coming. Come soon. Tell me. Madhu, the hotel's closed for the next three days. Go have fun! What a waste of all the batter. A three-day holiday for all of us, so that he can have fun. She's all ready. All the monsters in the house are gone. All that's left are us. We are free birds now. Have some sweets. Oh god! She's feeling shy. I can't take it any more. Hey! Vyjayanthi, the hotel's off for the next three days. I'm off for the next three days too. Thankfully we had a peaceful visit at Lord Manjunatha's temple. The concert must be rocking. The doors are still closed. Let him enjoy. He'd waited all these years for it. Why is the house so silent? Hayavadana must have finally calmed down. When will sire reopen the hotel? Let him first open the doors of his room. Let him think of the hotel next. - Grandma, shall I make a dosa for you? - No need. Why waste your time? I'll make one for myself. Go on. Father and aunt are here. They think our first night is done. But it hasn't, right? Here, have some dosa. I haven't slept in three days. Send the kid to their room. Uncle! Brother, she's irritated with something. I'll take care of the kid. Don't worry. It's okay. I'll take care of the kid. No one has to. I'll take care of the kid. Come dear. What's the point of feeding a person who's already full? Come on, kiddo. Let's take a nap. Why is he still being cranky? The house was empty and you were famished. Yet you didn't get to feast. It's a full house now. They won't go out. You'll have to. - Hello? - Are you busy? I'm feeling hot. Amma isn't well. Sushma called. She's pregnant. So, she can't go. She's asking me to go and take care. Will you come with me? I've been on leave for the last ten days. I can't ask for more... Wait! Stop right there! My mother-in-law is sick. She's asking me to go along. Your mother-in-law is sick. She'll be resting. You can be up and going. Hello, I'll come with you! Doctor told me that it's because of stress. You've been advised to rest here for two days. - I'm troubling you unnecessarily. - Amma... Didn't you go for a honeymoon trip, Vyjayanthi? Well, it's the wedding season. He's busy with the catering contracts. We'll go later. You don't worry about it. Get some rest. Where were you? I was out to find an empty bed. Only so you can rest too. Don't think otherwise. I'm troubling you a lot, son-in-law. Well, you troubled me enough and are not checking if it worked. You please rest. After mom goes to sleep, give me a missed call. Okay. I'm bored as hell. What do I do now? What is he doing? Play it. I'll watch with you. Play it now. Come on. Forward the video. Nothing's happening. Move back a little. - I don't see anything. - Be patient. Move forward. Let it go. Here's what you should watch. [GIBBERISH] - Where are you from? - Gauribidanur. Take your hand out of the pocket. Kids these days get done with the phone itself. Came to check if the mother's asleep, the daughter's passed out too. I can't wait any more. You don't understand what a woman desires for at all. Listen, there are less patients today. I'm free too. There are empty wards around. Quickly... Nurse, you mentioned of an empty ward. Where can I find it? It was empty a while ago. It's full now. Wait! Nurse! No, sir. None of them are empty. If I find an empty ward somewhere... Vyjayanthi... The pleasure will be ours. Where do I find one now?! Everyone's passed out. This is the right time. She's waiting by the window. She looks like a bomb from behind. - Son-in-law... - Mother-in-law! - Another missed chance! - Son-in-law. I'm troubling you a lot. I'm used to it now. I'll give you a missed call after she goes to sleep. Mother-in-law fooled me. What do I do now? Son-in-law... I wonder who else is faking to be asleep. What do I do now? - I'll give you a missed call. - Please do. My Jio network is available everywhere. If I wish to get away from mother-in-law, I'll have to find an empty ward. Looks like a sick old woman's in there. In here? More useless donkeys. Is the ambulance shaking or are the people inside shaking it?! Why is this shaking like this? What's gone wrong here? Woah! Nurse lady! Sir, we're a married couple. They've permanently assigned the night duty for us. Life is possible only if both of us earn. If you tell the world, we'll lose our jobs. When we get time, we tend to romance. Yes sir. We haven't even gone on our honeymoon trip. Looks like a long lost cousin of mine. - What do you do, brother? - I'm the ambulance driver, sir. No wonder. Kindly, turn off the lights and continue romancing. - Isn't it off? - But this disco like siren lights are on. Turn it off and reduce shaking the vehicle. Sure sir. This dud found heaven in an ambulance. Couldn't I be blessed with an empty lavatory? Hail mate master! The reports look good. Another scan would clear things. - Just a minute. - Okay, sir. - Hello? - Dude? Is it done? - The scanning is on. - Man, you're quick. I meant by mother-in-law's scan. Shut your trap and disconnect. Amma, take this. Rashmi will return from her trip tomorrow. She'll be here for a week. Are you giving her all the medicines prescribed by the doctor? Give these three tablets together. You'll mother-in-law will be flat out all night. Please have them. 1... 2... 3. You'll have a good night's sleep. No chance of waking up. If you need anything, just ask. That night dress looks good on you. Was it from the recent sale? No. It belongs to Rashmi. If only I knew that you play the drums this well, ...I would've taken you with me for my performances. Let our performances happen first. I'll accompany you next to your performance. No matter where I go. I do the banging. - You're so gorgeous, dear. - Wait. The door lock doesn't work. Go and check it first. Your mom can't be trusted. She might peek in. Let me close the door. The doors in her house don't have a lock. Pew-pew! Pew-pew! [MOTHER COUGHS] [IMITATES A DOG] - What was that? - The dogs. Are there a lot of dogs around your house? - Do you feed them rice everyday? - Yeah. From tomorrow, please don't. Leopards tend to prey on dogs when it rains. Why should we bother about it? [MOTHER CONTINUES TO COUGH] [IMITATES A DOG] This isn't a dog. It's my mother. Damn! She got to know! I wonder what's wrong. What's wrong, Amma? [HOWLS LIKE A DOG] Dammit! Slipped out of my hands! What next? How much longer do we wait? We're not going home. We're heading to a resort. My friends have booked one for us. Did you really discuss this with your friends? Looking at this frustrated face, my friends realised and sponsored this trip for us. What do we tell at home? If your mother calls, tell her we're at my place. If my father calls, I'll tell him that we're at your place. And then... How long will you be staying? The rooms are highly in demand now. Two days will suffice. Will you need access to the club, swimming pool and the gym? Madam, we have no time to spare. Okay. Sign here. I'll give you the keys. - There you go, Madam. - Hurry up! Let me call you back. Room no. 105 has been allotted. Madam, didn't we tell you not to allot a room to anyone else? There are a lot of high-profile people here. They're our regular customers. They'd booked the room long ago. Make sure they stay in the room. They can't get out of there. Okay. A new twist in the state's political atmosphere. In order to challenge the government and fight for their minister titles, ...around 7-8 council ministers have thronged a resort in Theerthahalli. Come on! Pick it up! Pick it up! Pick it up dammit! Pick it... Well. You look very cute. So do you. An hour later, I'll look a lot more cute. If you say yes, shall I go ahead and get some milk? - Milk? - Yes. The entire world thinks that we've spent our first night together. Actually, tonight is our first night. Women bring milk to their husbands on their first night. Today, I want to get it for you. The bloody restaurant guys aren't answering my call. If you approve, I'll go out and be back in a minute. Come back soon. One invite and I would never miss a funeral for anything. You think I'll skip our first night together? It's beautiful when women wait, but it's even better when men can't wait any more. STING OPERATION ON A NIGHT. Are those ministers inside the resort? Shocking details awaits you all in a few moments. Namaste, sir! Why have you been constantly calling me since then? I'm Kumara, a party worker from the Rasabaale constituency. - Which Kumar is this? - 'Catch' Kumar. Eight ministers are meeting in a resort in order to destabilize the government. Our youth party members have surrounded the resort. If you issue a whip order, we'll drag them along to the office. - Is this for real? - Yes, sir. The kitchen's bloody miles away. Why are you angry with us? Come on now. - Who are you guys? - Come on. Have some. Why are you making me drink? Let me go! Who am I? Two pegs and you can't recognise me already? Have another peg and you'll forget yourself. Don't worry. You'll be allotted some ministry. Don't do this! - Today is my... - Sir, he's not one of us. Let him go. Let him go. You carry on, Sir. Careful. I was looking for milk and they made me chug alcohol. - Where's the kitchen? - Over there. Thanks man. It's hitting me already. Where is he?! What's taking him this long? I hope the youth party workers are alert inside. They are. Where is the damn kitchen?! Dude, are you done with the deed? I will be done soon. A couple of ministers and their men have ruined the resort. They got me drunk too. Why did you get out of your room? - I came out to make Badam milk. - What?! Apparently, he's a minister from Badami constituency. Really? These guys are torturing me already. Enough with your calls now! Hello? Don't make any noise. Come on now. Pick him up. - Cover his face! - Who are you guys?! - Don't drop him! Careful! - Let me go. My phone's vibrating! Hello?! You guys are squeezing me in all the wrong places. Put me down! Who are these morons carrying me around like a sack? Put him down. Get inside the bus. - Wait! Why did you bring him? - Where am I? Who are you guys?! Kumara?! He's the son of Raghavendra Stores' owner. We thought he was a minister from Badami constituency. Hayavadana, there must be some confusion. Go back inside. Go back and look for the ministers. They undressed me at the wrong place. There's too much lightning. Wait... That's the media. Where is he?! Greetings! Please go inside. Get in the bus. Why are you covering your face? Get inside! Get going! Oh god! Disgusting! My first night with her has gone down the drain! I've come to my room, right? I can't handle myself any more. What took you so long? Where's the milk? Bubbled out of existence. What?! Neither did the night work, nor did the day. Got to try it tomorrow afternoon. What's wrong with him? Is this how you run a government? How do you shamelessly face the public? You should be disgusted with your behaviour. - Is this why the public voted for them? - Stop it! Spit on their faces! - He said he's going to his in-laws' house. - Give me a minute. He's gone to a resort. What business does he have over there? He's unable to get his business done with his own wife. What other business could he possibly have? He hasn't consummated his marriage yet. What?! Where is he now? Ever since the news went viral, he's unreachable. Let's see what the public has to say. I don't work to gain any political position. I'm just a party worker. I do as my High Command tells me. I'll take your leave. After Mr. Ramakanth who was from our community passed away, ...it is the wish of the entire community that one of our own take after him. Just like all of you, we've taken a call too. Our community members aren't limited only to this constituency, right? They're spread across 224 constituencies in the state. But I've already given him my word. What holds more value in politics? Someone's word or a vote? To contest in the by-elections of Rasabaale constituency, our party has unanimously decided to field our sincere party worker, Mr. Kumar. Having associated himself with social events, Mr. Kumar has been a helping hand for the orphans, poor and destitute. He's been selected as the MLA candidate for the Rasabaale constituency. Election campaigning in Rasabaale constituency is in full swing. Having offered a ticket to an ordinary party worker, wishes to gain another leader from the influential community. Here's your B-form. May good things happen to you. This man's obstacles are never ending. Can't believe things went awry in the very resort he went to. Despite a bike and license in hand, the road ahead seems unclear to him. The only place in Rasabaale where there's no network, is in this fort. Is Hayavadana here by any chance? Hayavadana, it's not like you committed a crime nobody else has. Why are you bothered about it? It's not good for me to climb all these stairs in this age. Why did you have to come so far? No matter how old you get, you're still my son. I know why you'd been to the resort. Neither should a father ask his son if he consummated the marriage, ...nor should the son tell him. Yet you pestered me to get you married. Why didn't you ask me to send you on a honeymoon trip? If a school's not good, you can ask your parents to send you to coaching classes. But if things didn't happen at home, how can one demand to be sent on a honeymoon trip? Aye! Until your job is done, don't come back to work. I'll transfer the money on Google Pay. Go! Enjoy! I've seen all the reports. The root cause is infertility. There's no need to be afraid or feel awkward. This is a persistent problem faced by numerous couples in the society. Are there a lot of complications, doctor? Complications lie here, not in the body. You've reached a certain age. I'm doubtful if you'll be able to conceive. Don't bear a child because the society is asking for it or humiliates you. Did you hear that? Vyjayanthi, your body is facing Thyroid imbalance. Exercise, dieting, meditation and yoga are a must for you. In fact for both of you. Consult me again after two weeks. Ma'am, we need to check your weight. Please come with me. Madam, can I lose my belly in two weeks? If she wishes to grow her belly, you need to lose yours. Listen! Wake up! It's time for Yoga classes. Wake up now. Take a deep breath. Freaking hell! What is she making me do?! Get up! - Stand up! - I can't do it. - Get up now. - Let me go. Uncle, stand up. - Give me your hand, lady. - Stand up slowly. - I'm sorry. - Stand up properly. On to the next posture. This is the butterfly exercise. - Sit down. - No way can I sit like that. - I can't do this. - You can. Just sit. Why are you doing this to me? Do it properly. If I do everything here, I won't be able to do much at home. Please! - You can do it. - Nobody wants to listen to me. Take a look. Sit like her. - Join your feet. - Lady, be careful. - Breathe out. Slowly. - I can't do this, lady. - Do me carefully. - Ready? Breathe out! - Uncle! - It's over for me! You'll be fine. Just relax. - Walk faster. - I can't. My bottom's broken. Hayavadana, when are giving us the good news? I'm struggling to catch a puny fly and she thinks I can conquer the universe. - To hell with her. - Poor guy. Eat this. Is this supposed to be eaten before breakfast or after? This is your breakfast. Why does it look like a child's vomit? This is Oats. A diet food. Looks like you understood nothing from the doctor's visit. Just eat it for god's sake. Fine dear. Where are you? Are the snacks ready? What are you saying? We're serving the second round. Don't dilute it so much. Watch it. Didn't you get the doctor's advise? We need to try during the fertile period. Neither of us can be under stress. Get home now. Ten more minutes, dear. Why are you gobbing like it up like that? Take it easy. Before she comes, I'll have to stuff it all inside. - Why are you forcing me to have rice? - When did I force you? Little devil! Come join us for lunch. No, father-in-law. I'll have some porridge. At least have the sweets. It's a festival today. When the house is filled with children, every day is a festival. Nothing else matters more to me. Some of the kids suffered from food poisoning after eating food from outside. Uncle, please give us some sweets. Therefore Swamiji has ordered that food from outside will not be brought into the Ashrama. - Get back inside. - Don't take us wrong. - Isn't there enough food inside? - Please forgive us. Come inside. You guys get going! Leave now. Thank you, brother. Brother, one for me. Please? Four kilos of Whea... Why is there so much leftover food? Couldn't you guys calculate the requirements? How did Hayavadana not realise? He's been doing this for two decades. Sir, all these years we would give leftover food to Ashrama. Apparently Swamiji has ordered against giving food from outside. We had to bring them back. Hayavadana loves to feed the children. Realising that the kids were happy, he'd make us prepare extra food. He would also pay for it. Hayavadana loves kids. You will not be able to conceive naturally. I didn't feel like telling this in front of her. Your only option now is surrogacy. I understand your misery. You've been suffering without being able to share it. I can never become a mother, right? I'm not hurt only because I can never become a mother. It hurts that because of me, even you can't become a father. Motherhood isn't decided by a woman's ability to give birth. She who nurtures is also a mother. It doesn't matter if another woman gives birth to our child. I'll nurture it and love it like it's my own. No matter what your decision is, I'm okay with it.

Hayavadana, Gundu hasn't returned home yet. I'm getting anxious. Father, it's late in the night already. Everybody at home is worried that you hadn't returned. Which goddamn home are you speaking off?! A home is a place where relationships are celebrated. How can we call ours as a home? I paid importance to my relationship with you kids ...when you weren't even mature enough to understand it. Despite everyone pushing me to get married again... I valued my parenthood more and am still suffering all alone. Here you are, the know-it-all. For your selfishness of becoming a parent... You've ignored your father, your family, your lineage and the respect we deserve. How dare you bring a child birthed by a stranger ...and think that we'll accept it as one of us? Shame! What's with you now? You think you can advise me?! Get lost from here! Father, don't take this wrong. Try to understand. Don't you dare utter another word. You are selfish. Your father's sacrifices and struggles mean nothing to you. Once you grow up and get married, it's all about you. We have no space or value in that world of yours. It wasn't a mistake. Only after we learnt that we can't have children, we took this decision. Is it wrong to wish for a child? - We've struggled a lot. - Yeah, right! And I've not? Did I not make my children my priority? You're talking as if I'm the selfish one here. Let go of my hand! I'm not the selfish one here. You are. You are the selfish one. It's you. The selfish brat! Even though we lost our mother, our father showered the motherly love on us. I wish to experience the love of a father by becoming one. Brother, one for you. Are you by yourself in the room? What are you doing? Are you drinking? I'll call you back. - Brother, we have a problem. - What is it? Our photographer Ramachandra, the moron has leaked a picture ...of you kissing another party worker to the Media. If this makes it to the news. You're MLA dream is done for good. But why did he do this? Sir, come along! Take your hand off my shoulders! How dare you?! If this news has to die, something bigger needs to make it to the front page. You there! Aye! Stop right there! Oh god! [KIDS SCREAMING IN PAIN] My leg! Don't cry dear! You'll be fine. [MEDIA] Are you the person in the leaked kissing photo? Is this the right time to speak of such nonsense? I know nothing about any party worker. What are you staring at? Send them away! Go ahead and clear them out. Move back! Clear this place! - Sir, we need an answer! - Get back now! Doctor, how's the condition of the kids? Are you okay? Give them the best care. Sharadamma, don't you have any responsibility? Where the hell were you when this happened? What a tragedy has occurred now! Don't worry son. I'm here for you. Give them better care! Doctor... Doctor, none of the kids should suffer any more. Scoundrel! How dare you mess with the lives of innocent kids? How do you know that it was him? Hello! The children have been constantly suffering because of him. He was using the children in the Ashrama to put up a good face in front of the public. When you came to the Ashrama during the anniversary... He woke up the kids who were asleep, fed them spoilt food. In an attempt to impress you. He made the kids suffer. He spread false rumours that they ate food from outside. Their only source of joy was the food being served by Raghavendra stores. They would get to eat their food once in a while. You trusted his words and stopped it. We don't mind if you feed us twice a day or don't. But there are people who feed us food, give us clothes and cake, but take pictures ...of us just so that they can share it everywhere and show off with the world. Don't ever let such people who misuse our helplessness into this Ashrama again, Swamiji. When you gave us a roof over our head, you didn't consider our caste, creed or religion. Similarly, when you're supporting someone, don't give importance to those factors. Let these kids not give up their self-respect for food and clothes. Raghavendra Stores will take care of their food and well-being. Please give us an opportunity, Swamiji. Dammit! Before finalising on adoption, didn't you consider other options? We were discussing about surrogacy. But... I was telling them about our decision. Please sign here. When a man thinks beyond his bloodline and his legacy, Families expand. If not, no matter how big a family, issues will haunt them. If those who are in old-age home and orphanage accept each other... This world will never be lonely again. A wife, a friend and a guru are three of the most special bonds. All of them start with acceptance. I get it, Hayavadana. But everyone runs a check on the health of the children before adopting them. But why did you...? Normal children might get adopted into good families. But these children won't have it easy. Every child here is the same to me. Everyone deserves a good life. So do these children.
