Just this. And that one? These and this. We look like girl scouts. Dad used to said: "Without a horse you are nobody." And where are we going to get it? Get onto it. There's a strange horse tied up there. Strange? Like a paint horse... but striped. Do the turkey. Hey you pretty punk... You shoot the hand, I get the head. Punk? Now you will see. Don't let him see. Sit down! - There's no one. - Fucker! Shut up already! Pretty small, right? Yes. It is a foal. A foal? I wonder his name? Striped? What if he only understands gringo? Some of what the woman said. What did she say? Focker? Focker... Focker... Orozco fans. Zapata fans. Villa fans. Carranza fans. Pure "fans". In the end they are all the same. Each one prays to his saint. So who's yours? They say that Obregón pays and that he pays well. He is a constitution fan. Another "fan"? And with Pancho Villa, it's finder's keeper. Money, gold... even jewels. It's better, isn't it? What if you can't find anything? But what if you find a lot of things with Villa? Better with Villa, right? But with Obregón the pay is safe. It won't be our choice. Eagle: Obregón. Sun: Villa. Sun. Let's go with Pancho Villa. I think Obregón would name us captain of cavalry because of Focker. Do you think so? Or second lieutenant of cavalry. It is a gringo foal. Sure? Well, with a gringo foal, why not? They say that Villa doesn't like gringos. Let's go with Obregón. Come on, come on then! Go! Punks... they left nothing. They fit small? Yes. But they are so pretty. What? It's my turn. I started yesterday. Yesterday? Yes, yesterday. That's it. Yesterday doesn't count. Leandro. Leandro. It's your turn. Hi there! - What what? - Are you deserters? Deserters? They look like Federales to me. No, man. Look at their hairs. And what if they dressed up? Let's see, why did you paint the donkey? It's a gringo horse. Gringo? Yes. So what are you? Hey? Mutes. He got his tongue cut because he did not know what to say. I'd say they are mercenaries. They support whoever is winning. I'd blaze them then. And what are you? What a joke. Who do you like? I know Zapata. - Are you...? - We are with the people. Well, mainly because we are from the town. Aha. And we want a land we can work on. Freedom. That: a land and freedom. Zapatistas! You should have started there! Weren't the Zapatistas the ones who cut your tongue? Get off, you asshole! Don't get mad. I'm not! I bet for the one who looks dumb! You bet on the other one! You hit me hard. Well, I wasn't lying. Let's go, in case there are others. Punks. They didn't say who did they support. - It's damn cold. - Sh. Sh. What? Wait for them to get naked. Just wank. Let's go. Shall we follow them? And the revolution? And Obregón? Not until we find him. Fagot. Come on, they're leaving... I said no. Not our choice... - Come on, I'll flip it. - No, it's mine. Eagle. What a weird horse. I'm going to tell Big Mom. What what! They are up already! What going on? What do you want? Let us go. Yesterday they no longer told us what's going on with the war. "Fans" against "fans". What? They say that Madero was shot. Well, I don't say anything. I just think. With Don Porfirio it was better. Even the weed grew bushy. But then, everything was smudged by that Madero. Because of him, the first ones left one by one. Later, in a herd. To complete that smudge then came the recruitment and they took the boys. We run out of men. You should have left with them. That's how they all do it. And who would stay? We cannot just leave. Daughters of smudge, that animal is not for that. It's delicate, gringo. You are going to hurt him. Use oxen! Damn hags! Come on, push! Listen to her. What? Wanna die? Because a wound is just an annoyance, huh? I think those nice stockings have never... You want another belly button? Come on, come on! We are Obregón fans. They will start looking for us. I'm going to do the bad thing. If you let us go, we'll go get the troops and help you. I don't say anything. I just think. Why is it that only one has boots? They only have long nails. When the corn is grown we'll let you go. There you have your stuff. You ruined it on purpose. It must have been like that already. You swear to God you did not ruin it? "Shall we follow them?" It was fate! We are never getting out of here. Because of you. Because of me... Asshole! Don't say that. Don't say what? I'm betting on the moron face. Hey, hey, hey! Hey, stop it, stop it! Move on. Enough. My name is Juana. What's your name? Odon. She is Adelfa. - And she... - Valentina. Let's go. Her name is Valdomira but she doesn't like it, she goes by Valentina. Take off your clothes. Hey, have you had a man? You make me blush. You are not. The lame one. She's so hot. Oh, ouch! It's enough, right? We should have left with our fight. With the aim of the lame...? The revolution is going to end and we are oxen. Obregón's revolution. To the chains! I have an idea to escape. ♪ To dinner, to dinner, to dinner ♪ ♪ cupcakes and pies, girls come to dinner ♪ I wish I was a rifle so I'd be in your hands. Nasty. You are tastier than beans with butter. Shut up and stop talking. Hurry up. What's the matter? Is she too good or what? Orale! Don't you say nice things? I just want to know one thing. I will tell you right ahead. Here's your beans with butter. Beans. Kiss Me. Get it out! You dirty whore! First you give it some sugar and then you shoot it, if it gets scared the meat becomes sour. That's not an animal to eat. Meat is meat even if it's from a striped mule. It's going to ruffle your guts. They're already like that because of hunger. Let's go. Let's go. Peel them! Come to the chains! Hurry up. Filthy bastards! Focker... Pick your stuff. Where to? I'm going with you. You liked the lame, didn't you? She makes the beans very well. We can't fit three... Focker is going to sag. Even if I have to walk. And her? You have the looks for me. The looks? I just want to know one thing. How can you be so buttery if you only eat nopales? Have a drink of "asshole-sleeper" so she doesn't find you guilty. And when we win the revolution, what are we going to do? Be a landowner like the landlord. That much? That's what the revolt is for. So that we can all have land, cows, goats and women. Is that land and freedom? Aha. When we win I'm going to have plenty of cows and harvest tomatoes. Don't breathe out when you pull the trigger. Clench your teeth. Clench my teeth? It's better. Aim here. If we are all going to be equals, and we're all going to have plenty of land, who is going to work there? Those who lose. Yes... If Villa loses, all the Villa fans are going to be pawns, or what? Those who lose will be pawns for those who win. Well, there is no way around it. Does it have a crooked sight? The tuna. (cactus fruit) The one of the left. The nopal. I just have to clench my teeth? Hey... Ok, lets go. Wait, let her catch a breath. Lay there for a while. Good morning, by glory of the Blessed One. Morning... Excuse me, I was resting my eyes. Do you want water? Whatever you prefer. Gold pesos, silver pesos, bilimbiques, Pancho pesos. Pancho pesos? Pancho Villa makes money. Although it is only good where he rules. Do you know where the Obregón fans are? That way. They are super happy. Because word goes that they wore Villa out. Although they also say that Obregón lost a leg. Sure? Everyone refills their bottles here and word goes around. Although sometimes with this one, I see others. With Obregón. Good morning, the Blessed One gives you. Do you like water? You can give what... Is she with you? May the Blessed One enlighten you. Kiss Me! Like this? Aha. Kiss me. Not like that, in the mouth. Another day. Shhh! Get out! Go there! When we fucked Rafaela I didn't tell you anything. The rifle, the horse and the woman are not to be lent. Well, we just have one horse and we have borrowed it. Then what? We are tired of this. Something else would be better, right? Do you want panela cheese? It would be nice. If you get milk, I'll make you cheese. No tortillas? Why don't you hunt something? My dad used to say: "We just hunt rabbit and eat it bit by bit." Giddy Up! We will never get there. You think the revolution is going to end today? Get on, Focker! Wait. Ah? Wait. Damn. Where to? Dumbass. Big Mom said that one day Big Dad got lost and he drank his urine. Did he drin them? That's not what killed him. That way? Or that way. Now, stop fooling around. My guts are curling with hunger. Mine too. Just ask and don't nag. What is it? Biznaga? (edible cactus) It tastes like iron. Do you want to take my piss? Are you okay? Are you okay? I'm talking to you. Leandro! Leandro! Don't look at her right in the eye. You make her nervous. Bah... Watch it. Don't look at her in the eyes! Are you feeling better already? The vultures were about to feast on you. What is your name? Leandro Pérez. Didn't you see a guy that looks like an opossum, on a gringo horse and with an old woman? Did they mug you? This eggmaker only delivers every other six days. Don't you know how to make her lay more eggs? General Quesada is good people, but don't contradict him because he's got short fuse. Can I ask you a favor? Would you read it to me? This? "Enedina: My compadre is helping me write this letter to you. Take it to Doña Geru so she can read it to you and don't be mad about it. " "I'm going to Sonora because at the hacienda... Siquisivá? Sisquisiva. "... from a certain Obregón family, there is good pay." "As soon as I collect some pesos, I'll send them to you so that you can come with me." "Take care of Leandro who is proof of our love." "Zelaya, November 21, 1900." "P.S. Don't forget to take the fleas off the goat... and clean the pen. " I just wanted to know that it's still here. My General. Would you rather starve or earn some pesos? We are going to win the revolution. We have a secret weapon. But if you don't want to... Well, we'll blindfold you and leave you where you were. Your call. Will you join us? Prepare everything, Major. Did she lay it? Not yet, my General. Zapata was not a peasant. And three weeks after Madero triumphed, he rose up in arms against him. Villa, a bandit, a highwayman. That is why we will follow the ideals of the late Madero. Ideals of a Man that no one ever let him rule. Leandro Pérez, do you swear to be faithful to the Madero ideals? Yes, I swear. Yes, I swear. I appoint you a private. Let's work! Break ranks... Go. The rest of the troop is out on a mission? It's just us. We part ways with the federales. Am I the only private? Here, we all were less. General Quesada was a captain, I was a corporal, now I am a Major. As soon as others sign up, you will be promoted. Portillo, go get firewood! Dark lands. The desert swallowed him up. He must be already dead. He is not far. I'm sure. What do you need Leandro's bladders to piss? Why don't you think for yourself? You always do what he tells you. Don't you want to do your things? Do you know the city? Guadalajara, Mexico. Do you know Mexico? No, none. Well, let's go to Guadalajara. They say it's pretty and it has a big church. There's plenty of people and there is always something to fill the gut. When we get there, you can give your boot to a cobbler to fix it. Let's go. Meeting time. We should tell him something. My Lieutenant, you are his compadre. If you spot someone, you shoot. And then we make the questions. You cannot stand guard here. Go further over there. You already heard it clearly. Our military objective is Coahuila. There we will declare the Madero Republic. To unite with the gringos. So neither Villa nor Obregón invade us. - Make an alliance with the gringos. - Yes. You put too much cinnamon on it, or what? Are you doubting the high command, Echeverría? That's not right, Vicente. Don't listen to that woman. Compadre, don't talk to me like that in front of the troops. She a spell on you. And she's going to lead us all to hell. What spell or what the fuck? Respect my rank, you bastard! My General Quesada, respectfully... Go fuck your mother! Someone else? You, Zedillo? You, Hurtado? You, Portillo? Write down, for loss due to insubordination of Lieutenant Echeverría, you all go up a grade. Also paid. Damn buddy... And now what am I going to say to his lady? Mayor Salinas, the corporal is right. You must know. Do you swear by his Holy that you are not going to tell anyone? The secret weapon is... Do you know what a Medium is? Mrs. Marta speaks with the spirit of Madero. Ah... a mystic. No, not mystical. Mystics heal the mind, if you tell them what you dreamed of. Mediums just talk to spirits. Should we put a cross on it? What do you draw your guns for? Wasn't that an attack call? No. Mrs. Marta wants water. Have you seen someone with a dumb face? I wandered like that to run into you. It worked. And the hag? Not our choice. She no longer wanted to continue and left for the city. And this? I already told you before. You ran like a mad pig and went tripping down a slope. To get down there we had to roll down the steep slope. And when we got there, you were gone. Do you think I could leave you like that out of your mind? Here. I thought you had taken advantage of me. You don't even know what you're saying. Had I known you were thinking that, I would have left with Juana. They look like country boyfriends. We have a secret weapon to win the revolution. You join? Are you going to name me a Colonel? Haha! Colonel? You have to strive a military career. But my horse is gringo. If I may, my General? No, not Colonel. But neither a Private since you bring a horse. Although it is kind of strange. Sergeant? Okay, yes. The horse belongs to both of us, tell him. So I'm also a Sergeant. - If I may... - Shh. Do you both ride it? Only one can ride it in battle to be a Sergeant. Not our choice. No, it's Ok. You are still a Corporal. You are a Sergeant with your gringo horse. Prepare the oath. - It's not a ... - That's not fair. I got here first and I can ride it. I think I'll have to execute them both. Know what? He better be a Sergeant and I'm a corporal. So you're still Sergeant. And you a private. Prepare the oath for this one. It is not a gringo horse, General. Isn't it a gringo horse? It's not a mare. It is African and not gringo, my General. - And where is that? - Where is that? In Africa. It's all yours. I give you $ 1. No way. Three guards in a row and $ 1. Five guards and $ 2. Are you going to make it scrambled? Make it scrambled. A guard and blond tobacco. No. To your stations. Do you know how to make her lay more eggs? We are fed up with dried meat. This way, so to avoid the Villa fans. And we turn around here, to avoid the Obregón fans. Where is the weird horse? And what about our supplies? Dried meat, all that you want. Well come on, the finger gets numb. Another? The other. Hey, when do they pay? Within five days. You are a hard ass. What do you say? Well, what I said. Right after the pay... off to Siquisiva. For what? Here they pay. You are a Sergeant. But not from Obregón. And the secret weapon? This one is going to win. We agreed to meet Obregón. You have to comply. I told them to make you a sergeant so to be cool. Obregón has a hacienda, "Siquisiva". And there... there are tomatoes, barley, wheat, dairy cows. And Obregón promised that if he wins, all his men were going to have one like it. Why do we always do what you say? Do you need my bladders to piss? I will no longer move from here. Not our choice... - Take out your coin and you'll see... - I already told you! I'm not moving. You are a Sergeant and now we are Quesadis... Quesada fans. It's today. Do they pay? If someone comes, you shoot first, then we ask. Do not move from here. Board time! Sergeant, what are you waiting for? If you are the spirit of Madero, make yourself present. Spirit of Madero, give us a sign. I come from the future Mexico City will be full of rails. People will ride small trains, for two people. I saw that Obregón will order the assassination of Zapata, Carranza, Villa. For 70 years, only one political party will rule, the Revolution Party of Obregón. Hurry to get to Coahuila and ally with the Americans. Mr. Francisco. Can I ask you something? Send Salinas as your frontman. He will take you to the gringo who is going to help you. Don Francisco, don't you see my compadre? Give the striped horse to Mrs. Marta. She will put it to better use. Don't you see my compadre, Don Francisco? I have to go. I'm in a hurry. I risk being left in limbo! Ask my compadre for an apology, please, Don Francisco. Do not touch her! She comes back by herself. Sometimes you're smarter than me, but sometimes you're worse off. Anyone can jiggle the body. Why didn't the soul appear? Are you sure about the bell? I saw it very clear. How? If we were all holding hands. I already told you. That old woman has something going with Salinas. What a coincidence that she wants him to go ahead. Can I talk to you? Have the mounts been cleaned yet? What do you want? To change our diet from dry meat, can we go for nopales? Only one. Why are you both going? You will always be mine. Forever... Don't you feel the earthquake? Look at the lamp, it is shaking! Lord, stop it from trembling anymore. I want to be like you, Don Francisco. They will not let me. Those vipers won't let me. The black vipers. The catfish. I want a lot... I'm going to release the horses. Friends! Can I take a picture of you? What's that? Where did you get the zebra? It is not called zebra. His name is Focker. It is a horse from Africa. Focker. Ok, look... I want to show you something. Slowly. This is a photo. And you make them with that device. I am a journalist and I take photos. What would we win? To be seen in the city. Guadalajara or Mexico? If possible, in both. I'm going to Los Angeles, in California, with the gringos. I'm going to interview the mexicans who live there. Don't move and look here. With the things we got, the revolution has already done us justice, right? We can buy ourselves a ranch. Like the boss. Spit it out already. I don't care about Obregón! Let's go to the other side. We don't speak gringo. Are there fellow countrymen there? My father left that to my mom. He says: "Enedina, here my compadre helps me write this letter to you." "Take it to Dona Geru so she can read it to you." "And don't go crazy." "I'm going to Sonora, because at the Siquisiva farm, of one such Obregón family, they pay well. " Spit it out. The truth, I'm looking for my father. My mom always mentioned him. "Apa said this..." "Apa said the other thing..." I want to meet him. Do not stay like that. Since we are little kids, we walk together. You're like my brother. I didn't want to look for him alone. You did meet yours. And I would have liked not to know him. He beat the shit out of me whether he was in a good mood or not. What do you say? I say nothing. I just think. You cheated on me. "Justice, land and freedom." "Obregón is the good one." I was super happy. If you had stayed, what's the justice of the revolution? Do you know if he lives? Sol, will you come with me? Let's see who gets Focker. I'm going with the gringos. Ask. If you go to the other side, it's yours. Just out of curiosity, Sun. Sun. Don't I know you, you bastard... Did you check him? Just bring dirty clothes and this. I want to see my General, Obregón. It's for something personal. Do you think it is easy to meet it? My father has known the Obregons since 1900. He works at Sisquisiva. Ask him about Leandro Pérez. He is named after me. You like him, right? Okay, yes. Isn't he a Villa spy, Colonel? No, he doesn't have a Villa fan face. For what you want the most, give me a little help. It's okay. Then give him back his goat. - Yes sir. - Over there. This is from Quesada's friends. Hey! Did he speak already? The same song. That he doesn't know. Bring on the Piñata. Where is Quesada? Gunners and troops. Two per person. Yes, Colonel. - Corporal, gather the platoon. - Yes sir. Chief, the expedition returned. Did they find Quesada? Why did you paint it? It is a horse from Africa. Was he searched? He's clean. What is your name? Odón Gómez. Prepare a platoon. Do you know him? You? Kill him or get next to him. What are you waiting for? I could have sworn they knew each other. Right between eyebrow, ear and mother, you bastard. Is it your aim or was it pure luck? So I shoot. Do you want to be one of us? Leave it. Put him where he is needed. Remember who helped you, you bastard. Thanks. Take the striped foal with the other horses. Can I collect my things? Go ahead. Out of the fifteen men who arrived, there were two minor injuries and no casualties. These people fought a lot. The Captain says they did. They ran out of park. Give part to my General Obregón. And bring Lieutenant Calderón so he sees this and doesn't think of doing the same. Yes, Colonel. I'll be right back. Beautiful... Oh, pretty. Today you will learn to use a weapon that is not artillery, but use it as if it were. It can save your life or your entire platoon. The weapon is called a grenade. Why is it called grenade? I was looking for you. Gentlemen, pay attention. Did you bring the zebra? - Yes, but it is not... - Answer "yes, my General". Yes, my general. But it is not a zebra. It is an African horse. It's better than a gringo horse. Where did you get it from? I found it on the way and then, then I started looking for my General, because with a horse like this, I'm sure he names me a Sergeant. Did you know that it is a circus animal? - Circus? - Circus! Circus, no? Take it to the pen for the mixers to play. - Hey, but it's mine... - Hey! Don't talk like that to my General . Sorry, he's new. A zebra... A zebra. Ay, ay, ay. Go back. Where is the Colonel? This weapon is very dangerous. It is like a bomb. Thanks to this, We gave the Villa fans their fate in the battle of Zelaya. Everyone must take two. Why not more? Those are the orders. Do not throw them like crazy. Do we throw them together or one by one? One by one. And throw them away because otherwise the shrapnel can hit you. 8 yards away? 10 yards? Why do you ask so many questions? And this lever? Run! Explosion. I get an itch where the arm is missing... And then here on the stump, I kind of feel numb. A concrete block. It is normal at the beginning. The brain does not remember the arm is not there. No... But there is a trick that Dr. Roviranes taught me. Look, open and close your fist, hard. But look in the mirror. There it is. That. Well yes... The grief goes away, huh? Let's hope medicine advances so we can attach your arm back. Hopefully, doctor. It was lucky they found it. In war, doctor, there is only death. And luck. You are absolutely right, my General. Like this one. He was the only survivor of the grenade explosion. What happened to him? Burns, bruises and he broke his right clavicle. Are you ok? How do you think? More respect for my General, Álvaro Obregón. Are you my General, Obregón? Thank you Doctor. Take good care of him. Don't worry. Hey, hey. Can you help me with something? Do you think my General is going to waste his time with you? What do you want? Howdy. Do you know a Mr. Leandro Pérez? Good afternoon. I do not know how to read. I am Leandro. Enedina's son. Take a photo. 1, 2, 3, say hi, say hi! Look here! 1, 2, 3... That's it! Another one. How far north? As north as we can. New York? No, silly. On this side here. Seattle. Seattle? Do you know what would be good? Getting a car there. You are nobody there if you don't have a car. Getting a car... And do you think we'll do well there?
