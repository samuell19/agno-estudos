Let's go forward! All! All have been waiting, please enter! - Seiji, I brought it. - OK. None of them came. - How old is her grandmother? - 75 years old. Time goes so fast. Now you are a student at Hope Hill Girl? Right. I am currently the chairman of Hope Hill Girls' school. Hey Seiji! I'm not called doka, I'm madoka. I will kill you! Fujio? Fujio! I don't think we need to come here. Noisy! We must be late. I told you, where are we going? Didn't I say to grandma's funeral Fujio! What are you doing? You haven't changed at all. What are you doing? That's because they keep chasing you. It is my fault. What? What? What? You stole a stupid bicycle ... I only borrowed it for a while. And your brother helps! Very stupid! We grown men just want to help people who are in trouble. Stupid! I do not praise you. All! Thank you for coming today. - Yuki - Please eat. I miss this. - Do you remember this? - Of course, this crooked cucumber. Very delicious. Fujio? Yuki hasn't seen you in a long time. Long time no see, how are you? - Of course it's good. - Thankfully. - This is delicious. - Let's all eat onigiro too. For a long time, I was very hungry. Big Snake's brother is still the same. What did you say Big Snake brother? We... How about Arata? Actually, recently I heard a new rumor about Arata. It seems like someone saw him with an unknown person. What? Hei, Seiji. Seiji Kirihara, let's play together. Come on You are so slow. Today my parents arrived late. Yes, so do I. -Doka.-- Madoka Sick. - I said Doka. - I told you my name is Madoka. Arata! Come on! Aunt. I am hungry. Come on, I've prepared cucumbers. Delicious. - Thankfully. - Mother and father. Father. - Have you eaten yet? - I eat burgers. - Is it true. Listen with this the six of you can be together forever. Nobody will be able to defeat you. You all can do what you want. Face your own feelings and live. Auntie, thank you. With this, we will always be good friends. I will always take care of him. Good word, Arata. Seiji, how was your lesson? - Always ugly, ugly. - Is that true? Seiji, you're lying. I heard that your grades are the best in your class. Is it true? The best ranking among Hope Hill High School. He is the smartest among his friends. This is truly a star of hope for a desperate community. - Hopeless. - hope. Our children. - Hopeless. - hope. Our children. Hopes in despair sound a little strange. Right. - I'll be back living here. - What? - Is it true? - Yup. In this way, Fujio rose again. Then your school ... Yes, of course Oya High School. I will reach the top of Oya High School! Murayama! You are still here. Oya High School. The place to determine who is the strongest of the School is the SWORD district O Murayama, chairman of Oya High School, has been announced. Will no longer involve, full-time students on the SWORD problem Todoroki was angry at Murayama's one-sided declaration . Full-time Representatives once again oppose Murayama. You're getting stronger, Todoroki. - That won't work. - No problem. With Todoroki's defeat. Part time &amp; Full time ... Become more mutual understanding. Feel this!!! Then the new era of Oya High School begins. Full time Oya High School. What did Murayama do? - Jamuo. - Yes. Call everyone Today I will fight with Yosuke. Is it true? You want to fight? You are still the same as before. Why are you here? Fujio How are you? Is that so, you are back. Very passionate, this is very passionate. Hey, Jamuo! Why are you so excited? It's time to return. Tell me more about the current situation. Anyway, I only stayed here for two weeks before moving. I feel that the current Oya High School will reach its golden age. And the situation is complicated. What are you saying? Now it has become very fun. is that fun? Let me finish you I will kill you. Tsukasa. Can you kill them? Of course. But starting today our leader. Replaced by this person. What? What happened? Never mind. Greetings!. Does that person greet us? Wow, how dare you say that. Woi, what are you looking for to die? Hanaoka Fujio. Starting today, Oya High School. There will be many guests who come here. Everything starts from here. The leader of Oya High School is Murayama. Split system full time and part time. This is where it started. After he announced that there would be no connection between future disputes between full time and part time. Todoroki uses his power to govern all students full time. But Todoroki has no subordinates. Why? Why? Why? Me too, but ... I don't want to be Murayama's subordinate, or Todoroki But he is the strongest. Strong, strong. Even stronger than you. But being a partner is another matter. Then, then, then. After that, there was chaos on the full time side. Then after that, the "Chunchun" faction. this is what disturbs the situation. Nakagoshi who led the second year and Nakaoka who led the first year. In short, they are very popular. Then what's the problem? The "Yasukiyo" faction that we just fought against. Yasukiyo? Fujio, in the same complex as us ... Yasushi and Kiyoshi, you remember, right? That's a crazy duo right? Both of them are in Oya High School now. Fujio hasn't seen you in a long time. Are you provoking us now? I came to fight. Now it's our turn to fight. What Shibaman Tsuji is under Todoroki. What are you saying? You're not bombarding the city now, right? Todoroki is now injured. We can handle people like you . Interesting. Then I will play with you. What? Everyone is here. aren't they all from the same complex? It feels, like in a complex flats. Fujio, stop joking. Oh yeah, Aunt Harazawa's shop has died. What? We cannot embarrass him for the rest of our lives. Hey, how can Toroki get hurt? What? Toroki? What is that? Isn't that your leader? OK! So after Toroki recovered. LET'S DETERMINE THE STRONGEST! Hey, who are you? Come on Hey, something's weird here! Stop me Hey, what are you up to? Yui. Hey, do you want to be happy with me? Who are you? What are you doing? Don't ignore me Don't always care for me like father. You are now coming. I don't care what you want. It's just that I don't want to make mom sad. Brother, let me go. You haven't been in school for a long time. There's no way you plan to come back now, right? Your clarinet Just once, play it. This is no time to cry. thanks. Alright, let's go to club activities. - Fujio, that person. - Are you Toroki? After your eyes heal. Let's determine the strongest one Greetings. Do you want to be a leader here? Of course. I told you, after your eyes healed. Damn Toroki, suddenly attacked me. - Do not worry. Come on I killed you, do you hear me? What are you guys doing secretly hiding here? - What? - This is a toilet for one person. What are you looking at, jerk !? Isn't that Red Rum right ?. Red Rum. Once appeared here. it seems like it's been appearing lately again. Eating this can make you calm, huh? I know you from first grade right ?! What is Red Rum? Yes, it seems to be popular again. There seems to be a dealer selling among the full-time students ... - The culprit? - Kuryu? I do not know. Murayama, what should we do? - Damn, damn it, what happens in this world? - Murayama. - I was fired from the shop where I work. - What? Everyone, will starve to death if this continues. Murayama, leave it to me. What is your business I will introduce you to my father. - Can you do it? - Of course. Thankfully. Are you Murakami? Anu, Murayama! Who cares about that! Yes. Looks like you're watching my son Kotaro huh ?. Yes. Do not take it wrong. I don't accept half-hearted determination. Well. Where is Kotaro-kun? Hey, that's right You introduce your father to me, you should stay close to me. I've seen it. I'm thankful you did this but, I lost it when I was fired at work. - This child is called Murakami. - Yup. My name is Murayama. Murakami is Murakami. - You two, take care of him. - Yup. - That is all. - My name is Murayama. Please tell me your name? Yoshiki Murayama. You look older than me. But I am your senior. - Talk to me respectfully. - Yup. - What? - Well. - Work there, follow me. - Yup. Well. What? To miss? Hey, Arata. Let's go. Why didn't you come to visit Aunt's funeral? Cucumber, do you remember? To miss. Hey, you two, show me. Look at me. What is this? Itukan Red Rum. To miss. Are arata selling drugs called "Red Rum"? Seems like him. Oya High School also exists. It is said that there is a school girl in our school who sells the drug. It seems like it is everywhere. Why does Arata hang out with people like that? I will see Arata's mother tomorrow. Let's investigate too. I will contact Arata again. - How about you? - me. I'm busy doing an assignment now. What kind of tasks? There are many types of people in Oya High School. which I must defeat and put them together. Forget it, isn't that just a fight? Don't joke, I'll play, I'm very busy. In that case. Thank you for the meal. Thank you for the meal. Why are you looking at me when you say that! Of course. Because we are still students. - Yoi, Society. - so annoying. I go home first. It's dangerous for high school girls to go home late at night. Madoka, if you see Arata's mother, tell me. Well. - Yuki, thanks. - Well. Son, that's dangerous. Watch Out. Hey, old man, you understand. - You're bad. - Obviously you're the bad one. Do you understand? That's right, Madoka is the strongest. You have to apologize to me and say you won't do it again. You have to apologize to me and say you won't do it again Yes. You have to apologize to me and say you won't do it again You have to apologize to me and say you won't do it again If you can marry her, you will not regret it. You have to apologize to me and say you won't do it again If you can marry her, you will not regret it. Yes. Do you understand? That's so cool that it beats badly. It was incredible. The man fell too ugly. - Arata, what's wrong with you? - Is it available? Noisy. He is angry. Do you all know? There will be such a thing here. That is true. It looks like it's called "Homicide House". It's scary. Arata, here it is. - Please. - Thank you. Hard work. Yes. Seiji. I understand. Thank you for buying. This week's money. Get more in a week. Very difficult to stop. Can produce tens of times more than today DOUBT. As long as the production plant is removed, we can make money easily without Kuryu's control.
