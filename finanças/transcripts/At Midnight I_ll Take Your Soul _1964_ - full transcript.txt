What is life? It is the beginning of death. What is death? It is the end of life. What is existence? It is the continuity of blood. What is blood? It is the reason to exist! AT MIDNIGHT I'LL TAKE YOUR SOUL I wish you all a terrible evening, my dear, brave little friends Remember these words: Those of you who have never been to a wake and seen the ghastly face of a corpse and yet refuse to believe in wandering ghosts and when you leave this theater you'll have to walk the streets alone... There is still time: Don't watch this movie! Go home! Too late. You wouldn't listen to me... You want to show your courage. Then, stay! Suffer! Watch. At midnight I'll take your soul! Carlos, why did you leave me? Be brave, Mrs. Joana. My condolences, Mrs. Joana. Rest assured I provided the best of my services. If you'll excuse me... My lunch, Lenita. Coming, Zé. That funeral made me very hungry. Guess I'll have to double my fee. I'm sick and tired of all that boohoo. It's your business, Zé. You should take care of your clients. I'm tired of these hicks. Hey, where's the beef? No meat today. You forgot, it's Holy Friday. What do I care if it's Holy or the Devil's Friday? I'll get what I want and no Bible thumper will stop me! I'll eat meat today, even if it's human flesh. Watch out Zé! The devil may be tempting you. If I bump into him, I'll invite him over for dinner. What a nice surprise. Terezinha wants to invite Lenita to the procession. I think it's no use. I'll talk to her. - As you wish. - Where are you going, Zé? To buy some lamb. For Easter? No, to eat today. I'm going for a walk, Lenita. I know, it's that woman. You think I didn't notice the way you looked at her? You know I hate melodramatics. You can't treat me this way, Zé. Stop bothering the poor girl. Have some respect for Antonio, he's your friend. You talk too much. Antonio will be there soon. I don't want to stay there too long. Good evening. Going somewhere? I'm taking Terezinha to Mrs. Clemencia's Antonio will pick her up later. What a coincidence. I was going there, too. Don't worry, I'll take her. But Antonio may not like that, Mr. Zé. Antonio is my best friend, right? I guess so. It's up to you, Terezinha. Well, if you have another appointment... Ah, but he does. Don't you, Aristides? You have a very important appointment. Isn't that so? I just remembered. I do have an appointment. I'd appreciate it if you could escort her. Good night, Terezinha. Good night. Thanks for allowing me to escort you. No reason to thank me. Will Antonio take long to pick you up? No, he said he'd come soon. Lucky guy. Antonio's luck drives me crazy... having you as his fiancée. That's too much. I think I'm fortunate to be loved by Antonio. Either you're silly, or you want to play games with me! You're not the woman for Antonio, you're the woman for me! Take your hands off me, Zé! You're hurting me! Let's see if your lips are as defiant as your words! You have the fangs of a snake and the face of an angel. I won't tell Antonio. But please, don't let this happen again. Very well. I'll go with you. Thanks. I'd rather go by myself. Some wine, Maria. Ranulfo. Yes, Mr. Zé? Go to my house and ask Lenita to send me the lamb. I'll be right back. It looks like a good game. Room for one more? Thanks. You're very kind. Maria, one more. That man scares me, Mr. Francisco. Don't let him see it or there'll be trouble. I pass. I double. Too rich for me, too. Looks like it's just you and me. Care to go on? I double. Brave man. Now you're behaving like a real man. All... or nothing. A thousand to see your hand. But, I don't have any more money. No? Then show me your hand. Three kings. Tough luck, my friend. Four aces. No! It can't be! Let go of the money. I can't! I need the money. Let go of the money! My hand! My hand! As I said, I like brave men. Call the doctor. I'll pay for the bill. Ah, you are my witnesses. It was an accident. Here's the meat, Mr. Zé. Excellent. Good timing. A scene like that makes one crave food, eh? You, Bonifacio. You look hungry. Have a piece of lamb. No, thank you. Come here, boy! Have a bite. It's quite good. Today's a holy day. I can't have meat. Eat it! Please. Eat it! Ah, the doctor is here. What happened? An unfortunate accident, doctor. The victim is Zerequiel. Take good care of him and I'll pay all the bills. Your kindness knows no bounds, Zé. Thank you. Another wine, Maria. Better take him to the hospital. All right. You act as if you're afraid of me. No, Mr. Zé. I have other customers. Leave them to Francisco. Tonight you work only for me. What does he want with my niece? Is no one brave enough to stand up to him? Then why don't you? That's just what I'll do. Zé! Leave her alone! And who's going to make me? I am, you envoy of Satan! Stop, Zé! Stop! You're going to kill him! Have mercy, Zé. I have enough work with those who die of natural causes. You can be sure: I'll charge double to bury anyone I kill! Let's go home, Zé. Let's go. Oh, I'm going to the graveyard. Anyone care to come along? We were walking by when I heard screams. What happened, Antonio? It's alright now. Thank goodness. By the way, Antonio let's take a raincheck on that fishing. It's up to you. I'm going to take Terezinha home. Want to come along? But Antonio, he has to go home. Lenita is all alone. A woman who can't bear a child needs no care! We'll talk tomorrow, Antonio. Good night. Good night. Terezinha rejects me because of Lenita. Is life worth living if there's no son to continue one's bloodline? What is one mistress among so many women? Lenita has to die. Lenita has to die. I'm so sorry about what happened. Please forgive me. Tell me you're not upset with me. It is all right, Lenita. You make me so happy. I can't help but feel jealous. I want to make you happy, my dear. Your wish will be fulfilled. You're going to make me very happy. This will be quite an amusing show! A woman must belong to only one man. Since you are of no use to me... I'll do you a favor and spare you of the sin of needing another man. Is your life worth living if you can't bear a child... to continue your bloodline? You won't be an obstacle... to my accomplishment of the one and only truth. Terezinha will be mine, and my lineage will continue from her womb. I'll have the honor of seeing you die before my eyes. Pity... I thought you were so unique. There you are now, in the painful throes of death! You agonize, because you can't scream! Lenita, you are no longer mine. You've become Death's mistress! It was a great show! Thank you! Let's make sure the doctor takes good care of you. There's nothing more I can do. She was bitten by a spider. Poor girl. It must have been so painful. I'll file a report. All right, doctor. I'll take care of the rest. Well, goodbye. I don't want to die. Shut up! Don't abuse your child! He is the continuity of your blood. Real men don't cry. Take care of your son. Don't hurt him. It's been fifteen days since Lenita died. I miss her a great deal. Of course. You and Lenita loved each other very much. Yes, one day everything comes to an end. We are born, then die. That is life. I've got to accept that. What if we go fishing tomorrow? Sure. - One more thing, Zé. - Yes? Do you want to visit the gypsy with us? What for? Terezinha wants to know her future. You know, women about to get married... - But, do you want to go? - Well, you're never too sure... I'll go. It'll be fun to see two superstitious saps under the spell of a witch! Good evening. Come in, children. Make yourselves at home. Have a seat. - I'd like to know... - Say no more! Look into my eyes, I'll tell you your future. Beware, my child! Beware! Happiness is yours. Do not forget who you love and all will be right. Otherwise there will be death... misfortune. Read my future now. It may be a little better. Your lifeline ends right here. Don't think of your earthly life and all will go well. Fulfill your soul. Don't allow the earth to receive your body in broad daylight. Your salvation demands that you be buried at midnight. Stop that nonsense, you old witch! Forgive me, but I can't stand this foolishness! In your eyes I see your fate. You'll pay for your sins. When the time comes, you'll suffer the horrors of hell! You go to hell! Let's go home, Terezinha. How much? The laws of the supernatural prevent me from accepting payment when death is foretold. Go, my children. Beware! Terezinha, let's forget that gypsy woman and think about what to do tomorrow. I know. I'll take care of everything. Have a good night's sleep. Do you want me to wake you up? So it's all set. Let's go, Antonio. - Good night, darling. - Good night. I don't know what's wrong. I feel restless. A good bath will cure that. Come over and have a nightcap with me. Try this wine, Zé. I think you'll like it. Drinking is the best way to ward off evil spirits. As if you believed in such things... Well, I must agree with the believers. I don't understand you, Zé. Where does all your disbelief come from? It's like a rebellion, but against what? You have a lot to learn, Antonio. I can't disbelieve when I never had any belief. To believe in what? In a symbol? In a non-existent God created by ignorance? Yes, I am a rebel... Against fools like you who fear what you don't see and become slaves to that which really exists... life! Why should I fear life? Because it's life that makes your flesh throb. Life feeds your feelings, and if you aren't strong you'll be defeated when you face it... and suffer. Take a look at your people. Why do they fear me? Because I dress in black? Because I believe in myself? Because I laugh at their beliefs? No. Because I'm stronger than them and smart enough to rule over them. They're weak because they fear what they don't know. I am free. Therefore, I am stronger. You may have your reasons, but I'm happy the way I am. I love Terezinha and I know she loves me. I have no inner conflict. I want only to marry her, and I know that'll happen soon. We like the same things. I feel good believing in God. I hold no grudge against anyone. You know, Terezinha is like an angel. We're going to renovate this house and live here together for the rest of our lives. That's what I want. What was all that faith good for? I'm stronger than you! Antonio! Antonio! I don't know, Barretos. It was quite a shock to me. Believe me, I would give my life for Antonio's. Don't think I'm accusing you. You were the last person to see him, so you must remain a suspect until we have an autopsy. Excuse me. Commissioner, the doctor needs you. Excuse me, I must go to the morgue. I'll stop by my funeral home, then I'll meet you there. Very well. In the name of the Father, of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Murderer! Damn you! Murderer! Calm down, please! You killed Antonio, you murderer! Calm her down! Close the casket. We won't soon forget Antonio's funeral. They say he was buried at midnight to save his soul. He must have had a dark side. He was Zé's friend. We should run that guy out of town! He's got an eye for Terezinha... And the girl is at home all alone. Her father went to the city to see his wife at the hospital. Here he comes. Maria, a mug of wine. Hey, did you change your name to Maria? Leave the bottle there, old man. Leave it! I asked her to serve me. I'm waiting, girl. Hey, you. How much for the bird? But, it's not for sale. How much? Well, I don't know. Is two thousand enough? Fine, fine. I'll take it. We'll chat some other day. What now? Never seen a little bird? Or shall I take the measurements for your coffins? What do you want so late? Don't be afraid. I brought you a present. Thank you. Good night. Hold on, girl. Show some manners. Please! What will the neighbors think? Don't worry. They won't think anything. They don't have the guts to go out at this hour. What are you going to do with the bird? Throw it away. You won't accept my present. No. Poor thing. He must be hungry. I knew you had a kind heart. Please. You're hurting me. Have mercy. You wouldn't treat Antonio like that. Don't talk about Antonio! Go away! After all I did to rid you of that fool, you tell me to go away? Don't touch me! Be kind, Zé! You're a difficult woman, but I like it the hard way. I want you to be mine and I get what I want! No! Help! Snake from hell. You'll be very quiet. Mercy! That's right. That's the way I like it. You will give me the son I want. You've ruined me, Zé. I can't go on living. I'm going to kill myself. It's always like that. All women say the same thing. Later they regret it. Life is good. It's not worth trading for death. I'll be back some other time, Terezinha. I'll kill myself, Zé, but I promise you won't have any peace. Antonio was buried at midnight. And at midnight, Zé, you'll know fear. For I'll come to take your soul! Wherever you take me, if there are women like you, I will be happy to go. If you'll excuse me... This is my lucky day. The devil himself is here. Spirits! Spirits! Do you hear me? Which of you is going to take my soul? Behold! I'm waiting! Arise! Out of your tombs! Take me straight to hell! Can't you hear me? Can't you hear me? Take me straight to hell! Antonio! I possessed Terezinha! What will you do to me? Nothing! Because you no longer exist! You're dead! Dead! Your hour is coming. Your end is near. You'll feel the burden of your sins. Shut up! Old witch. I'll make your coffin. Scorn the living! Mock the dead! You'll live the horrors of hell! How can we charge him if she left a note explaining why she did it? There's something strange here. I can't figure why she didn't put the blame on Zé do Caixão. Idiot! She had the courage to kill herself. Strange, she didn't blame me. Her father insisted she be buried next to Antonio. Good evening, doctor. Did I frighten you? Hmm... The savior of mankind. Pity the unsung hero! The report is a formality. Sorry I'm so curious to read your report. But, as they say... Eyes are made for seeing. What are you trying to do, Zé? Nothing. Just making sure your eyes don't see what they shouldn't Sorry, doctor. You make me so happy, I can't help but feel jealous I want so much to make you happy We're going to renovate this house and live here together for the rest of our lives At midnight, Zé, you'll know fear, because I'll come to take your soul What are you trying to do, Zé? I want to make you happy Together, for the rest of our lives I'll come to take your soul Lenita! Antonio! Rodolfo! All dead. I did it for you, Terezinha. You've forsaken me. You didn't give me a son. You've doomed my bloodline to extinction. I want a son! Damn you! Damn you! Curse your faith! Terezinha! Come out of nowhere. Punish the crime of my passion. Torture my flesh. Take my soul! Why don't you come? You are a ghost from the past. Yet I feel my blood boiling in my veins. I am alive! Alive, do you hear? And you are dead. Rotted! Eaten by worms! Heaven! Hell! Reincarnation! The power of faith! Symbol of ignorance! Where are you, Satan? Lies! Lies! May the earth crack open! The skies be torn! I want the end of the world! I challenge your power! I deny your existence! Nothing exists but life. Nothing is stronger than my disbelief. Destroy me! I have no God! If he exists... I want proof! Lies! What an unfortunate accident A sad loss for our town. Such is life. Excuse me, gentlemen. Evidence! Evidence, my friends. Well, it's nine o'clock. Today is Day of the Dead. Time to go home. Yes, the night is pitch black. I should be going, too. See you tomorrow. What's the hurry, fellas? It's the Day of the Dead. We shouldn't be out. To believe such ridiculous nonsense... It's not nonsense. Last year Gumercindo scoffed, but then he saw the wandering ghosts. It's true, Mr. Zé. You shouldn't make fun tonight. Or you may run into the Procession of the Dead. Procession of the Dead, a bedtime story for children. Everyone has a right to their own beliefs. Okay then, you win. No more talk of that. Now stay and have a drink with me, alright? Anyone turning me down? Not at all, Mr. Zé. I like men with strong opinions. Chico, drinks for everyone. Don't you want a drink, fellas? Come, have a drink. Maria. Here's a gift for being so kind to me. No, Mr. Zé. I can't accept it. My uncle is coming. Good evening. I'm here to pick you up, Maria. It's very late. I was just about to leave. Were you paid today? No, uncle. Mr. Zé gave it to me as a gift. Take your money back! My niece will take no gift from you. I gave her the money. I want her to have it. If you won't take it back, it stays right here! Let's go, Maria. Old-timer. Pick up that money. Pick up that money. Now! Enough. He's pushed us around for too long. Time to settle it for good. I won't pick up that money. I won't pick up that money! What will you do to me? What will you do, Zé do Caixão? What will you do to me? I won't pick up that money. I won't pick up that money! Pick up that money. I'm going to count to three. One... Two... Three... Give it to your niece. Good evening, gentlemen. This is the only place I found in town. There was nowhere I could go for information. Can we help you, ma'am? I'd like to know where the Queiroz family's house is. I'm Mrs. Matilde's niece and I'm here to visit her. There was no one to pick me up at the station because I missed the afternoon train. Dona Matilde lives far from here. Her house is beyond the cemetery. Could anyone take me there? Not tonight. You won't find anyone. I'm willing to pay. No money in the world would be enough. It's Day of the Dead. No one goes out at this hour. What am I going to do? I don't know anyone in town and there are no hotels. Don't worry. If you'll allow me, I'd be honored to escort you. I am at your service. I appreciate it, sir. How could I thank you enough? My reward is to walk with such a beautiful lady. You're very kind. You could stay at my place, I'll take you tomorrow. Thanks, but I'd rather go tonight. Any other offers, gentlemen? If any of you think yourselves brave enough, I'll gladly step aside. Let's go. Ah, by the way... If I bump into a corpse I'll send him your regards. People here are very superstitious. They try to cover their fear, but they're all a bunch of cowards. - Aren't you afraid? - Of spirits from beyond? I may fear some of the living, but I can protect myself. You'll have to admit the night is cold and dark. A night like any other. How many births and deaths are happening this very night? You're right. I don't believe in this nonsense, either Don't be frightened. It's just the old witch. Beware! Beware of the dead! Go to hell, sorceress! When you hear the wind blowing over the trees, it won't be the wind, but the wandering ghosts. When you see a black cat in your path, it will be the Devil. When you hear footsteps and there is no one behind you, it'll be the damnation of your soul. When you hear the death call of the owl, it'll be the harbinger of your end. Don't wait until midnight. When you see light in your path, it'll be the candles of the Procession of the Dead. Run away! Because they'll come for your soul! What horrible laughter. I'll take care of you on my way back. Witch! Let's go, my dear. Well, here we are. I bid you farewell. Would you like come in? Thank you. I don't get along with your aunt. I'd rather not be seen by her. Well, I hope to see you again before I go. Don't worry. I'll make sure of that. My name is Marta Queiroz. I'm Zé, to my friends. Looks like someone is coming. I should go. - So long, Marta. - Good night, Zé. She is pretty. If I play my cards right, it's a sure thing. When you hear the wind blowing over the trees it won't be the wind, but the wandering ghosts. When you see a black cat in your path, it will be the Devil. Who's following me? Is this a joke? Look out! Look out or I'll shoot. When you hear the footsteps and there is no one behind you, it'll be the damnation of your soul. I must be impressionable tonight. It was only an owl. When you hear the death call of the owl, it'll be the harbinger of your end! A light? I'm safe. I'm safe. The candles of the Procession of the Dead. It can't be real! I must be seeing things! It isn't real! They are dead! Dead! I know it! I must see them! I must see them! I must see them! I don't believe it! I don't believe it! It's a lie! A lie! There was a terrible noise. I was too frightened to go alone. Something must have happened here. THE END
