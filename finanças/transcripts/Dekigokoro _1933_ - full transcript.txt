He lies and says he'll come again." NANIWABUSHI NARRATIVE BALLAD "Your sincerity won my timid heart. It was love at first sight." Pay attention! You're missing the headliner! Leave him alone. Kids don't care about these stories. "Takao will come next March... next March..." Look at the barber! Old man, get your mind off your business! "That was the true love of Takao, a geisha." "Everyone yearns for love. Love sets our thoughts in flight." You can say that again! I hate girl trouble. Girl trouble's not so bad. Money trouble's worse. "Seeking love is like climbing a waterfall." Trust me and just get married. It ain't bad. Put tonight's bill on my tab. I'll bet you were a real looker once. And now? I can't be too honest. I owe you money. Hey, old man, mind your own business! Is there anywhere around here I can stay? Sure there is! I've got a kid but no wife. Not in front of your son. How can such a young girl be homeless? I worked at the silk mill in Senju until yesterday. Fired? You mean you have no relatives? Don't fall for that old trick. Young guys can be so heartless. What are you going to do? She can stay here. She won't cause any trouble, will she? If she does, I'll be responsible. Dad, you're late for work. Don't hit your dad's shin like that! Obey your parents while they're alive! Don't your teachers tell you that? You know why a hand has five fingers? If it only had four, your glove would have one extra. Very funny. Thank you for your kindness last night. I spoke to her and decided she can work here for now. I was drunk last night. Sorry to impose her on you. Not at all. She's very nice. See? I'm a good judge of people. Sorry, but I'm choosy about women. Everyone's so kind to me. Hear that? Isn't she sweet? What grade are you in, little man? My name's Tomio Kimura. Third grade, Class Four. My son's very proud of being a good student. With better manners, he'd be head of his class. He's too good for a useless father like you! I'm not as useless as people say. Doesn't Tomio need a lunch? The school feeds him. He turns stupid if he misses a meal. Maybe they ought to feed you too! Could you imagine me in school at my age? I doubt schoolboys go after girls the way he does. I forgot to ask your name. Harue. What was it again? Harue. UNION BEER She reminds me... of my old flame. Looks exactly like her. You still have a soft spot for your ex? No, not her. Who then? That young girl? Act your age, old man! What about Ohan and Choemon? I wonder if he'd give me an advance. I want to buy that cutie a gift. You've asked so often! I've got nothing to lose. He's an even bigger idiot than I thought. Where'd you find such a nice girl? She's like a daughter to me. Please be nice to her. You take such good care of her. You haven't sold her off yet. Anyone who messes with her deals with me. "For whom does she rouge her face?" Isn't she adorable? She's wasting her time! Let's get going, old man. No, not today. My stomach suddenly hurts. You're a lousy actor. Drop the act and let's go. I forgot something! My good luck charm. I can't go anywhere without it. Please send that bastard off to the factory. My stomach's killing me. I was praying to get better. I can't be late. I'm going. You're all dressed up, Kihachi. Where's the funeral? I look like I'm going to a funeral? Don't say that! Why aren't you at work? I got you something special. Don't tell the old lady. She'll be jealous. Do you like me? You're very kind to me, uncle. Don't call me "uncle." Who do you like better, me or Jiro? He scares me a bit. He's actually a very nice guy. But I'm even nicer! I really broke the bank on this. BUT THE WORLD WE LIVE IN IS A CAPRICIOUS PLACE... May I have this? Do you like soldiers? Want some high-ranking ones? Shall we go to Jiro's place? I was just tidying up. You're too damn nice. Don't start acting too familiar. You have any more pictures of you in uniform? She wants some. You're a crafty one... getting the kid to butter me up. The old man's waiting at your shop. Hurry back there. Is this how you intend to repay his kindness? Don't play my friend next door for a fool. Kihachi's got his reputation to protect too. I'm not that kind of woman. He's very kind to me. I think of him as an uncle. How about thinking of him as a husband? You'll never understand... the way I feel. I don't have time to worry about your feelings. SOMETIME LATER... Won't you come along to the shop? The old lady's worried. She hasn't seen you in ages. I don't get along with that Harue. I'd like a word with you about her. Go on. I'm listening. I'll sneak over to your place later. Wait for me. You're looking very dapper these days. It's the times. So am I twice as handsome as before? Go somewhere and play. I'm busy studying. How can I study when you're doing that? Please just go out and play. That's part of being a good son. This waiting is torture! Oh, you shouldn't have. We needn't be so formal. Actually, it's about Harue. She's a fine girl. She feels like one of the family. So I need to think about a suitable husband for her. It's a pity for a girl her age to be all alone. Especially with shady characters like Jiro running around! Actually, I'd be happy to see her marry Jiro. Did that bastard make a move on her? He's avoiding her for some reason. Well, he's a fool! You're right. Let's face it. She's too young for me. You're awful! You thought I'd offer you her hand? Well, what about Ohan and Choemon? Wasabi is so strong. For old times' sake, please talk him into it. I'm placing my trust in you. Please try. I'm choosy about women. If I don't want her, that's that. How dare you say that! She's too good for you! Then you marry her. It's not often that a girl falls in love with you these days. I'm not interested in such a homely girl. You're a stubborn bastard. But then so am I. I'm gonna get you hitched, like it or not. SO KIHACHI SAID, BUT IT WAS A TRAGED Y FOR HIM... Stop moping and sing me a naniwabushi tale. Well, young man? Did you say "young"? Do I really look that young? Don't try to flatter me! Get this! I hear his dad's a big idiot. He is not! He's a grown-up who can't even read. He just looks at the pictures. He doesn't even go to work, just to the old lady's restaurant! Who did this? I did. A person should tell the truth. When George Washington cut down a cherry tree... You confuse me by bringing up stuff I don't know about! Telling the truth won't give you magical powers. You can't put this plant back together! You big dummy! You don't work! You're always drunk! You trying to lecture your dad, you little squirt? Drunk or sober, I'm still your dad. Who cares! You're a dummy! You can't even read the paper, can you? Newspapers are for selling to the junk dealer. Son! Forgive me, son. I haven't been feeling right. I'm useless as a dad, but please don't hate me. THE FOLLOWING MORNING... What about that matter we discussed? Don't be in such a rush. Leave it to me. Behave yourself at school, and pay attention. Be patient and read your books and you'll learn. I put up with work at the factory. That's why they pay me. Here's fifty sen. Buy whatever you want. Are you serious? It's hard for a poor man's kid to make friends. See the grooves on the edge? I can file my nails with it. Hey, it works! Being so lavish with money this early! I've never done anything for him. I want to be a good father once in a while. Fifty sen to a boy his age is like ten ryo to us. No, more like a thousand yen! I want him to feel rich for once in his life. About Jiro... It's time you said yes, Jiro. It's time you quit meddling. Your son is sick. They said to hurry home. My kid can't possibly be sick. He might have gotten hurt. How did you get sick so suddenly? He stuffed himself with sweets. You spent all fifty sen? A poor man's kid can't get a break. You shouldn't have given him so much. Take good care of him. Such a fuss over a stomachache! Take a swig and go to sleep. It's good sake, really full-bodied. I was worried, so I left work early too. You can't just leave him like this. Stop scaring me! He's my son. He can't die that easily. A doctor needs to see him. Get dressed. 48 HOURS LATER... We'll do everything we can. This charm works wonders. This is terrible. We may have to hold a funeral. At least I have formal summer wear. Don't tempt fate. Don't worry. Your son won't die that easily. Easy for you to say! He's not your son! Forgive me, but I have to go now. Harue will stay. Just tell her if you need anything. Your son's teacher is here. I'm no good at talking to teachers. Will you greet him for me? You must be terribly worried. Did you have the game? We beat Class Three's team. What's ailing him? He ate fifty sen worth of sweets all at once. Orange soda, jelly... candy twists, fried dough sticks... toffee and watermelon. But it was really all my fault. I also gave him some cold sake. And he had some bananas too. Hey, Jiro, what was his illness called? Acute enteritis. All the kids at school hope you get well right away. I look forward to seeing Tomio grow up to be a great man. Be a good boy and get well. Hear what he said? Wasn't that nice? You really have to get well. We only have each other. You can't go and die before I do. Know why a hand has five fingers? I'll never forget that one. I wouldn't get five yen for this stuff. It's horrible not having an education. I got my son sick and can't pay the doctor's bill. The factory won't give me an advance. It's so hard to find money! I thought I could get by without saving anything. Don't even think about it, old man. The doctor wants to talk to you. Why is it such a mess in here? We're trying to scrape together money for the doctor. How much do you need? Maybe 40 or 50 ryo. I'll raise the money. I'm sure I can. This is my chance to repay your kindness. What a sweet thing to say! Such a young girl helping a grown man! Hearing those words, I could almost bear losing him. Even he could die with a happy heart. I'll bring something in the next few days. Don't be so full of yourself! I may be poor, but I won't beg the likes of you for money! Hurry to the hospital, old man. I want to speak to her in private. Don't forget your place! Think you can put two grown men to shame? But how else am I supposed to repay his kindness? No matter how you paint it, people will say we're sponging off you. You know how young women end up who want to make lots of money fast? Who cares what happens to me? You don't care. I'll raise the money. Don't you have any idea how I feel? Don't speak. Just do as I say. I have an idea where to get some money. Why do you need so much money again? I can't tell you. Just lend it to me. We're old friends. Please. LABORERS NEEDED IN HOKKAIDO I know you'll pay me back... but when? LABORERS NEEDED IN HOKKAIDO As soon as I get to Hokkaido. I was just kidding. THANKS TO WARMHEARTED PEOPLE... Dad, you know why sea water is salty? From all the salted salmon. Very funny. Try giving me another 50 sen. Scaring us like you did! Better if you had kicked the bucket! I bet you wanted some funeral cake. You lied to me. This tap water is salty, and there's no salmon in it! Jiro's suddenly decided to go to Hokkaido. To pay back the money I lent him. All this brat does is cause trouble. This isn't good-bye forever. Stop crying like that. Just when you come to understand me, we must part. I don't think I'll ever be happy. Don't be so pessimistic. Be patient for a while. I'm going in good spirits. I don't want a teary farewell. I'll come back to you, I promise. I heard you're going to Hokkaido. I have no right to complain, but you could've talked to me first. Let me go instead. You have Tomio, old man. Kids can grow up without parents. That kid'll grow up just fine on his own. Jiro, you have your whole life ahead of you! There are people depending on you. My ship sails at 10:00. Don't try to stop me. I didn't mean to do it. Don't hate me. I'm going to Hokkaido. Please look after Tomio. It's a large sum, but I can give it up knowing it saved a child's life. You can't go all the way to Hokkaido after your son was just saved. Your goodness of heart is more than enough for me. Accept his kindness. You can work to repay him. We have to help one another. The barber says such amazing things! A long life has its rewards. I've never been so happy! Remember to obey your teachers at school. And don't eat too many sweets. When will you be back? You little fool! What a silly question! My mind's made up. Just let me go! You guys know why a hand has five fingers? If it only had four, your glove would have one extra. What's that land out there? America? Idiot! We're barely out of port! My son is real smart in school. With better manners, he'd be head of his class. No! No! Can I make this ship stop? Is that land connected to Tokyo? Of course. Sorry, but I'm going home. Why is sea water salty? From all the salted salmon. Very funny. THE END
