Hello? It's Paola. I have a feeling that someone is following me. - Deliver the letter and call me back. - Okay. Christian, please give this to Mr. Oliver. Yes miss. - I won't be able to meet him this evening. - Certainly. - Thank you. Good evening, maestro. Miss Whitney left this for you. Thank you. I'd like a whiskey. Neat. You're taking advantage of me. You can't ask me to do such a thing... it's blackmail! It's just a favour! No, it's blackmail! I can't live without that stuff anymore and you know it... ...and now you want to force me to... - Your whiskey, maestro. - Thank you. Fine, I don't have a choice. I'll do what you want. Tonight? Yes. You handle the rest. The victim... I'll make sure... I need money. Don't worry about your supply. Ok, it's a deal Waiter. Waiter! - Christian. - Yes, maestro. - Someone is leaving. Is it a man or a woman? Describe them for me. It's a woman and she's wearing a white cape. She seemed drunk. I've never seen her before. Look behind me. Who's there? I didn't serve that table, but now there's no one there. How is that possible? Perhaps the other person left through the back door? - Mr. Peter... - Burton! What are you doing here? I could have made it home by myself, it's just around the corner. - She didn't show up, did she? - No, she didn't. - Why? Were you expecting it? - No, no. I just didn't trust her and I thought that if maybe she didn't show up, someone should be here to meet you. You have more foresight than I do. Read this letter to me. Well, what does it say? - Well...Miss Whitney says... - That it's all over between us, right? Well, I should have known that this would happen sooner or later. - You didn't like her, did you? - Well actually I... Let's go home Burton. - Good morning, Mr. Victor. - Good morning. - Where are the scissors? - Annie. - Come here and help me. - Okay. - Good morning, ladies. - Good morning, Mr. Victor. - What a hunk! - The boss has good taste! - Ok ladies quit wasting time! - Get back to work! - Who can work with Mr. Victor around? - You can dream about him tonight. Modello 173: This Autumn's main event. It's a little bland, but I can't think of anything better for this one. - I'm exhausted! - Is the list complete? - Yes, finally. - Did you get my plane ticket yet? - Yes. Don't worry, it's all taken care of. I'm going to take this list to the printers. Fine. - Good morning, Margot. Good morning, dear. - Hello Victor! - How is everything going? - Great! Oh, the new designs for the show! Looks like you have them all picked out. Not bad! This one's excellent, what a beautiful line! Good job! The women of Hamburg will go crazy for your collection. And you will make me crazy! Where were you last night? You could have called instead of just leaving a note! Well, it was so unexpected. I had to help an old friend of mine. I wrote that in the note, didn't I? - When do you leave? - Tomorrow. It will be a great success, I'm sure of it. Yes, I'm counting on the collection going over well in Hamburg. It would get the season off to a good start! Well, I'm going to have a look at the new models. - Hello, Wendy. - Hello, darling. When I woke up this morning you were gone. Yes, I had to leave early. - Let's have breakfast together, I have something important to tell you. - Okay. - Is this alright? - It's great. Perfect! What do you think of this, ma'am? No, I don't like it, the fabric is too heavy. Let's try it with a crepe de chine or something similar Have her change into the other dress. Is everything ok? - Yes, ma'am. Remember girls, it has to be finished by tonight. Here are the fabrics you wanted to see, ma'am. Do you like them? Yes, this one is fine. Ladies! Helga... Turn around. - Make the hem a bit shorter. - Okay. - Anna! I'm a magician! I've transformed you into another woman! - Why don't you try transforming yourself into another man...a real one! - Silly girl! Enough, quiet! She's dead. Margot, what happened? - Who was in here with her? - No one, she was alone. That's ridiculous! Look, the shawl is ripped! - Someone must have attacked her. Victor! Francoise, we must call the police. The information we collected, Inspector. ...time of death, how and where the body was discovered... ...witness testimonies. I hope that you've told me everything... ...at least all of the essentials! Everything seems to be very straightforward. The only strange thing is... ...the disappearance of that basket. I saw it on the floor but then it disappeared. Yes, you told me. Does anyone her know if Paola Whitney ever have any problems with anyone? Was there anyone who hated her enough to do such a terrible thing to her? - You think that Paola was... - Murdered, yes! - That's absurd! There was no one in the changing room with her. Fine, fine. You were a good friend of Paolo Whitney's, right? We lived together, but... I don't know of anyone that hated her. I don't think that Paola had any enemies. No enemies. I don't know...a friend. Maybe a fianc√©e...or a lover. Yes, Paola had a man. One that she saw often... Who cared for her a lot. But this person could never have done her any harm. - Hello, Miss. Margot. - Hello Mr. Burton. We must speak with Mr. Peter. - He is recording. - He told me not to disturb him unless it was of great importance. Please sit down Inspector. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Paola Whitney was found dead. Dead? - Was she murdered? - We do not know for sure. That is why I am here collecting information. Well, you must have some idea, an opinion at least! At the moment, no. For the moment, I'm just asking questions. - What do you want to know from me? - Whether Paola Whitney your lover? "Lover" is an outdated word, appropriate in the 1800s but now? - I do not know any other words that express the same concept quite so well. - Ok, fine. Well, let's just say that she was my lover up until last night. Last night she told me that she didn't want to see me anymore. Actually, she wrote me a letter. She wrote you a letter? Last night? Why did she break it off? If you knew Paola you wouldn't ask me that! Paola was an ambitious girl... ...she knew where she was going and how to get there. She could never have spent her whole life with a man like me! Why not? They tell me that you are a very rich man. Yes, but also very blind. Anyway, Paola had been a bit anxious lately. Something was on her mind. Margot, what do you think? I don't know. She didn't confide in me. - I don't know anything. - Are you sure... - She's telling the truth, Inspector. Okay. If you think of anything else that would be useful... I'm counting on you collaboration, Mr. Oliver. You can count on me! I won't easily resign myself to Paola's death. Naturally I will counting on you too, Miss...? Margot. I'm sorry to see you like this. I know that you cared about her very much. The studio is closed today. I can keep you company, if you want. I must find out who is behind Paola's death. Peter, it is crazy to think Paola was murdered. I already told, I was first to enter the dressing room and no one was in there. Well, then how did she die? You don't meant to tell me that this seems normal! - Who else was she seeing? - I don't know. - We each had our own lives and... - Are you afraid to tell me something? Paola and I had a relationship, but it wasn't love. I had no illusions about her, I knew I wasn't the only man in her life. Oh Peter, if only you knew how much I'd like to help you! Wait a minute! Perhaps there is someone who can help. - Maybe Harry... - Harry? Paola said that he was her cousin. He has a photography studio. What are you doing? Hello, Harry. I have told you I don't want you here, get dressed and go. - Don't you like me naked? Why? - No reason. Now leave me alone, I'm busy! Alright, I don't want you to think that I am pushy! When I come back I do not want to see you here. Okay. Have fun with your photographs! You could have told me that you were impotent! Bye! Are you sure that the shawl didn't belong to Paola? I had never seen it. She wasn't wearing it when she went into the dressing room. She must have found it in there. But who could have made those scratches on her neck? I don't know. Maybe she got them when she fell. I can't think of any other explanation. You said that there was a basket in the dressing room that later disappeared. What does that explain? It was small, too small for a person to hide in. I thought I told you to get lost! Why don't you go be someone else's whore... Wait here, Burton. - Nobody is here, it is rather late. - Right! But the door was open. That's strange. Go and see if he's in the back. Harry? Harry? Mr. Harry? - What is it, Margot? A body! Harry is dead. - They killed him, they slit his throat! - Calm down. There must be a telephone here. - Yes. - Find a phone and call the police. Why didn't you mention this Harry fellow? I didn't think he was so important. If you had let me decide, maybe he would still be alive! Are you accusing her of this crime? Mr. Oliver, I am paid to solve crimes like this. - So just let me handle it. - Who's stopping you? - You! - By taking certain initiatives. - If anyone is stopping anyone it is you! I decide what needs to be done! Call police headquarters. But I thought you wanted my collaboration. Yes, but I don't want to investigate a third crime. Are you trying to say that I might be the next victim? - It's a risk that I'm not willing to take. Inspector! Could you come here a moment please? - Yes. Peter! - What is it? - Have a look at those negatives. - Send them to be printed. - Yes, Inspector. I understand how you feel, but I don't want to leave until I speak to the Inspector. You go. Take my car. Have Burton accompany you... ...and tell him to come right back. - Okay, if that's what you want. Go! - Where is she? -I made her go home - What for? - She was upset. But if you need her she is willing to collaborate. Okay fine. - But how will you get home? - Don't worry about it. Inspector, in my opinion, behind these crimes lies a tale of blackmail... - Or perhaps something worse! - Oh really? What makes you say that? Whoever killed Harry was looking for something. Maybe he didn't find what he was looking for... ...and if you search hard enough... That's what we're doing, Mr. Oliver! And I can tell you that we've already found something. What's that? Believe it or not, even we policemen use our brains every once in awhile. We found some negatives. - Do you know what's on them? - Yes. But you aren't going to like it... They're of Paola Whitney. Paola is dead! The only thing I care about now is finding out who killed her. They're photos of Paola Whitney with a man... ...in bed, of course. - With that photographer? - No. - With Victor Ballais, the husband of Frangoise, the owner of the fashion studio. -Victor Ballais? Victor, I'm upset about what happened. - I'll cancel the fashion show. Maybe it's better if I don't go. - Why? Don't worry, I'll take care of everything with the police. They won't give us any trouble. I hope not. Paola died under such mysterious circumstances! - Is there something you aren't telling me? - No, why would you think that? Please tell me truth! No misunderstand me... ...I knew that there was something between you... I hoped that it ended soon... ...but I didn't. - Francoise...I... It's true, I was seeing her, but it was nothing serious. She was what she was... and the evening before she died... What's that? Let go of me! I'll kill you! It was only a threat. Yes, maybe at that moment I really would have killed her... ...but I didn't Believe me Francoise. I believe you. ATTENTION PLEASE. FLIGHT 314 FOR HAMBURG IS NOW BOARDING. That's my flight. I have to go. If anything happens, call me. I'll come right home. I won't leave you alone. - Are you Mr. Victor Ballais? - Yes. Come with us. Inspector Jansen wants to see you. You found them. She wanted to use these to blackmail me. So, you admit to the blackmail? This can be used against you. It's an element that makes you look guilty. Of adultery? Yes, I admit it. Paola was trying to blackmail me by threatening to show those photos to my wife. - And you? - Well...I... ...I don't know what I would have done. I didn't even have time to think about it... ...but I wasn't about to take it lying down! That whore wanted me to leave my wife and move in with her. She wanted the fashion studio...everything! I love Frangoise and I never would have done it, but I didn't kill her. Is that clear? First of all, you are not Frangoise's husband, so don't try to bring "conjugal love" into this. You only stay with the so-called "Mrs. Ballais" so that you can exploit her. Without that woman you would have to go back to your old 'career'. We know all about your criminal record. You have been convicted twice for exploitation. - Would you like me to refresh your memory? - No, that's all in the past now. I earn an honest living now, managing the studio. Speaking of which, I'd like to know why Mrs. Ballais only gave you that position a year ago. You've been living together for much longer. We were in a bad car accident. My wife was hospitalized for several months and during this time she asked me take care of things at the studio. And is this how you "take care of things"? By going to bed with the models? Listen Inspector, maybe I'm no saint, but that doesn't prove anything. You don't even know how she died! You can't convict me with just a few photos! Do you know who took them? You don't think he introduced himself, do you? Especially given the circumstances. No, certainly not. But you could have recognised him and followed him and then gone to pay him a little visit later on! But I don't know who he is! I never saw him again! Calm down, calm down! Inspector Jansen. Hello, what is it? What? Are you sure? Yes, of course. Thank you. It's absurd! It was the coroner. The autopsy indicates that Paola Whitney died of a heart attack. - You mean that... - She died of natural causes. And I can't accuse anyone of her death. - Now you have to believe me, Inspector. - Yes... ...at least as far as Paola is concerned... ...but I'll be in touch. - Stop by anytime.! The photographer was also killed... ...and his death is a bit difficult to pass off as 'natural causes' I'm actually not asking for much to keep quiet. If I had told the police... ...that you had the shawl, you would be in big trouble. Fine, I guess I can wait but I won't wait long, so hurry up. I'll be thinking of you. - Who was it? - Wrong number. - Did you hear? In the paper it says that Paola died of natural causes. But how can that be possible? I don't believe it. That scream sounded so desperate. I can't get it out of my head. What a terrible way to go. I feel sorry for her. I really didn't like her, to tell you the truth... Maybe you didn't, but someone else sure did. - What do you mean? - Nothing, I was just thinking ...of a certain person who likes to give shawls as gifts. Who is it? If you know, you should tell the police. Why? I don't think it's a crime to give a shawl as a gift... ...and besides, you know I like to break the rules. - Hello? - Susan? - Yes, it's me, Susan. - Tonight I have another job for you. - No! I don't want to do it! Have it your way, but I feel sorry for you. I know you will soon be feeling very sick. Yes, I'm sick. I bet your supply has already run out. I can't live without it. Don't be cruel! I don't want to do it! You promised me! Kill her! Die! Die! Die! - OK, the film is all logged. - Good. I already have a few motifs written down and with Burton's help I'll soon finish the job. Burton, ask Kurt if he would like something to drink. Right away. - No, thank you, I'm in a hurry. - It's time for us to go too, maestro. - Certainly. I'm ready. - Did you get everything we need? - Yes, but you know, I... - Then let's go. All that money spent... and I've never even used a camera. Don't worry, Burton. This camera does everything for you... ...and besides I don't need artistic photographs. Margot will let you in. I want you to take pictures of every detail of the studio. Don't leave anything out. Don't you think I could just go in and have a look around and then describe it to you? - No, I don't, Burton. You will describe your pictures to me... ...that way you'll be sure not to forget anything. Who knows, maybe we will discover something. Are you sure that no one else will be there now? Of course. Go ahead and tell Miss Margot that I am waiting for her. - Go on. Don't worry. - Yes, sir. Watch out! Where were you going? Burton, just now a woman crossed the street... ...a woman with a white cape. She has a strange walk...hesitant. - Yes, I see her. - I need to know who she is. Follow her! Try to find out where she is going and where she lives. - It's very important. - But the photos? - Forget it. Don't let her out of your sight! Go! - Hi, Peter. - Margot. Hurry, get in the car! We have to follow Burton! What happened? - Hurry! Hey! Sir! Sir! I'm going to have to give you a ticket. - But...the bus! - I'm sorry. Okay. - Where are we? - Near the station. - Do you see him? - No. - Drive around again. Yes, there he is! He's talking to a policeman. Poor Burton, he always manages to get himself into trouble. And be more careful next time. Yes, I will. Thank you. Unfortunately, by the time I came out of the department store, she was already getting on the bus. I would have followed her in a taxi, but then that policeman arrived. - Do you remember the bus number? - Yes, it was number 28. Try to catch up with it, Margot. Keep your eyes peeled, Burton She may have already gotten off. - No luck. It's empty. - How many stops did you count? - Four. Well, that narrows it down a bit, as long as she didn't get in some other vehicle after she got off the bus. - I'm sorry. - Don't make a big deal out of it. You can still redeem yourself with those photos. Let's go back to the studio... ...and while Burton is taking the photos, we'll have a bite to eat at the Sheraton. So, you knew all about Victor? Yes, but not that she wanted to blackmail him with those photos. I suspected that Paola might be up to something, but... ...I didn't tell the police because it would have been the same as accusing Victor of the crime... ...and I'm not sure that he... But why didn't you at least tell me? Oh, right. You didn't want to hurt me. You're a wonderful girl, Margot... ...and I, like an idiot, picked Paola instead of you. - Don't be unfair! Paola may not have had any scruples, but she was loyal in her own way. She could have gone behind your back, and you would have never known, but she chose to break it off instead. Right... ...and coincidentally, the woman who got away from us today was at the restaurant the same night that I received her letter. But, who can she be? If I knew, maybe this case would be solved already. She is definitely a drug addict. I figured that out right away. She was talking about blackmail... about needing money. The person who was with her that night must have supplied her with drugs in exchange for something else... ...something that involved a victim... - That was Paola! But I can't just go to the police and accuse a shadow... - A voice, a scent! - What? A scent? Mr. Peter, I'm finished taking the pictures. - Good. Did you find out anything? - No. Well, actually one of the janitors heard something about those yellow shawls. - From who? - From one of the models... a certain Helga. - Helga? - Thank you. - Good evening. Is that you, Wendy? Where did you come from? Aren't you a pretty one. Here kitty, kitty. Helga! - Help me get her into the car! - We have to take her to the hospital! Easy does it! Let's go! Take her away. Listen, would you mind telling me how you always happen to be around whenever there's a corpse? Would you mind telling me, Inspector, what those scratches and that shawl mean? Or perhaps you think that she died from 'natural causes' as well? That's for the coroner to decide, not me... ...and if you know something you had better tell me instead of trying to be funny. Unfortunately, I know very little... ...but if I were you I wouldn't leave that girl in the hospital alone, not even for a minute. Thanks for the advice. Don't you have anything more intelligent to suggest? Yes. You need to locate a certain woman. I can describe her if you'd like. She's... ...fairly tall, not particularly young, and always wears a white cape. Her voice is strangely hoarse and she walks with a hesitant step...almost as if she's staggering. - Listen, I... - I'm not finished! This woman probably lives somewhere along the number 28 bus line between the end of the line and Frangoise's studio. She is also a drug addict... ...and has a very strange scent... - Oh, really? -Yes, really. ...a very strange scent, almost feline. - Listen, Mr. Oliver... Yes, I know, you're going to tell me that I'm blind... ...and that this is all a bunch of nonsense and that you can't do anything with such vague information. Well, I'm sorry, but I can't tell you anything else, Inspector. Now you know everything that I know. Let's go. Would you mind letting Margot see that shawl? They suspect me in the death of that blackmailer... ...and now they'll say I killed Helga too. - I'm sure that we can sort everything out. - How did you find out about this? - I called the studio. When they told me what happened to Helga I thought I was going to go crazy... ...I couldn't just stay in Hamburg! I took the first plane back... - What about the show? - I postponed it. I'll go back after I've seen Wendy and after they've dropped all charges against you. This damned thing is ruining everyone's lives. Before we go to the hospital, I'd like to go home for a minute to change. Wendy, it's me Frangoise. Wendy! - Frangoise, Helga is dead! - Yes, I know dear... ...but try not to think about her now, you have to think about getting well. - Oh, Frangoise! - Try to stay calm. - I don't want to stay here! Get me out of here! I'm afraid! I'm so afraid! They tried to kill me once, and they'll try again! - Get me out of here! - Yes, of course. - Hello. - Hello, Inspector. - I heard you were back and so... ...you came right away. Thank you. What is it this time? Do you want to arrest my husband? Or me? Don't get upset. You have an excellent alibi, but... But I don't, right? I don't have one. Fine. Arrest me and let's get this over with. Then if someone else is murdered I'll have an alibi too. Please! Listen, Inspector... I know that those photos have given you some crazy ideas about Victor. Well, it might interest you to know that I already knew about his relationship with Paola Whitney. - Victor told me all about it. - Oh, really? When? The night before Paola's death... ...when she threatened to blackmail him. You could have told me about this sooner, Ballais. I was going to, but then you told me that Paola hadn't been murdered after all... ...so I didn't think it was necessary. - Right, but then I said something else too or don't you remember? About the death of that photographer. Why don't you accuse me of that second crime as well? I could have done it to protect my husband. - Sure. Those photos could have been used as evidence against you. - Precisely! - And if you want to hear my alibi for that evening just ask him. - Of course. That evening, Frangoise and I were together. That's right. Do you want to know what we were doing, Inspector? - No, no, I can imagine. Then are we free to go? Or do you want to accuse us of Helga's death as well? ...and for having driven Wendy into such a terrible state? - As far as I'm concerned, you're free to go. You may even return to Hamburg, if you wish. Thank you. Thank you. - Let's not think about it anymore. But, I want you to be sure. Sure about what? Don't you get it Victor? I don't care what you did or didn't do. No, you need to know. Frangoise, the other night I went to see Harry... Enough, Victor! I don't want to know! I don't want to know anything! But, I didn't kill him... ...I just went to get the photos, but when I got there he was already dead. I had to leave almost immediately because Margot and Peter Oliver showed up. - Peter Oliver? - Yes, a damned blind man who has been doing some investigating on his own. Mr. Peter, it's all been taken care of. Good. When does it come out? This evening. It will be in all the papers. Excuse me, I'm going to change and take an aspirin. - Of course, Burton. Go ahead. - Thank you. I have a package for you, Miss. Sign here, please. Thank you. Goodbye. You're the only friend I have. - Someone left this package for you. - Thank you. - Hello? - Did you receive my gift? I'll be coming soon to see how the shawl looks on you. - Inspector! - Let them through. What brings you here? The police station told us where to find you. - Discovered anything Inspector? - Well that poor girl certainly didn't end up under a subway train on her own. - Inspector! Look! - You go too, Burton. They found the head of a black cat on the tracks. Now maybe you will believe me, Inspector. Karl! Follow them. Inspector! Look what we found. "To the owner of the black cat killed last night..." "...to collect premium please call..." Peter! Burton! Burton, what is that? And what about the basket? Peter! What is the meaning of this? - I scared her. - Maybe you resemble the killer. It's terrible, Peter. Now Wendy too. - Try to stay calm, my dear. Would you mind explaining this to me? "Black cat killed yesterday night: white dressed woman to collect premium..." "...please call Peter Oliver. MA 78456." I've been putting ads like that one in the papers for the past three days... ...only today I updated it. - Do you realize that if the killer reads this... ...well, you wouldn't be able to defend yourself! - Don't underestimate me. You see Inspector, investigating this whole thing has even made me forget that I'm blind. Burton. You're playing with fire! What is this? Would you mind telling me where you got this yellow shawl? - In an ordinary shop. - What do you need it for? - To perform an experiment for you. Burton, bring that basket over here. I also have a black cat, just like the one that was killed. Go ahead Inspector, place the shawl in front of the cat. As you can see, nothing happens. - And? - Be patient, the experiment is just getting started. - Proceed, Burton. - Right away. Now place the shawl in front of the cat again. - What did you put on that shawl? - A common liquid repellent. - A repellent? - Yes. It can easily be found in stores. It is odorless to humans, but as you just witnessed, some animals, particularly cats, are irritated by its scent. Under normal circumstances, however, even an irritated cat would only leave a few scratches... It could never kill... ...but with this it could, those scratches would be fatal. Curare! - So, you think that the killer dipped the cat's claws in this poison. - Exactly... ...and after being scratched, the victim drops dead... ...of a heart attack. Like Paola Whitney and Helga Schurn. That poison leaves no trace, as you well know. Yes, the police investigators also came up with this hypothesis... ...but you make it sound like it's a hard fact. Hello? Yes, Peter Oliver speaking. Don't worry, I only want to help you. I read the ad in the paper. Please, come see me. No, I can't. I'm afraid... ...afraid that I'll end up like that poor creature. He was my only friend. I've decided to tell the truth to you, to the police... I don't care. I just want out of this nightmare. I want this terrible blackmailing to end. - I'm innocent. - Speak up, I can't hear you. What is your address? Yes, tell me where you live. Hello? Yes, yes...I heard you. Come quickly, I beg you... I'll tell you everything and I'll finally be free of all this. - I live at... - Hello? We got disconnected before she could give me her address. Now we are going to have a hard time tracking her down. No, wait. Maybe... Burton, play back the tape of the phone call! "...to you, to the police...I don't care. I just want out of this nightmare." "I want this terrible blackmailing to end." "I'm innocent." - "Speak up, I can't hear you." "What is your address?" "Yes, tell me where you live. Hello?" Stop! Rewind the tape, Burton! "I'm innocent." - "Speak up, I can't hear you." "What is your address?" "Yes, tell me where you live. Hello?" - Did you hear that? - What, those noises? - Yes, exactly. Do you remember when I told you that the owner of the cat had a strange scent? Now I know where it comes from. Don't you see? - No! You have eyes, but you do not see. You have ears, but you do not hear. She was calling from a pet store. You can hear canaries, a parrot and even a dog in the background. We already know roughly where that woman lives. Don't you remember what I told you? - Yes, you mentioned a bus line. - Right, number 28... ...somewhere near the last four stops. - So you want us to investigate all of the stores in that area? - Yes. OK, fine. if it makes you happy. There can't be too many pet stores in the area. - Hello. - Hello. Did you need something? - No, I just brought your mail. - Leave it on the table. - Can I help you find something? - No, thank you. You can go. - Are you sure you don't need anything? - I thought I told you to go. Thank you. - And take these sketches with you. - Yes, right away. - I'm sorry. - Why don't you watch what you're doing! - Just leave it and get out! - Yes, yes...I'm going. Hello? Get me Hamburg, please. Hotel Atlantic. Frangoise Ballais, please. - Hello? - Mrs. Ballais? - Yes. Hello? I have your husband on the line from Copenhagen. Thank you. Hello? Victor? Victor! Hello? Operator, I can't hear a thing! We got disconnected. Hello? Good morning, madam. Hello? Victor! Operator, what's going on? Seven shawls of yellow silk. Five are already dead... ...still two more to go. "Another woman murdered... the mystery of the black cat still goes on." "The victim is a certain Susan Leclerc, wife of a circus owner and ex lion tamer." "'They were both trainers of lions and tigers." "Her circus career ended when her husband was attacked and killed by one of those ferocious beasts." She must have had to shutdown the circus and then faced some hard times... ...before finally opening that pet shop. Maybe that black cat was all she had left of those happier days. It was the loss of that cat that made her call me. - Poor woman. - But at least it's all over now. - Over? No! ' ‚ÄúU? ' 'W.! Why not? They found the poison in her store, just like you said. But no motive. Why would that poor woman kill Paola... ...and Helga and Wendy and Harry? Why would she do it? The police will figure it out sooner or later. Let them do their job, Mr. Peter. I have an appointment to pickup that score for you at the copyist. Do you mind if I go now? - Go ahead, Burton. - Okay. Hello? Yes. Good evening. - Mr. Peter? I'll be right there. Just a moment, please. It's Miss Margot. Hello, Margot. Yes, what is it? What? Photos of who? Of that woman who was killed? Yes, Margot. Come right away and we'll let inspector Jansen know. Peter Oliver. I know who killed Paola Whitney and the others. I can tell you everything you want to know. Are you alone? - Yes. Get in. I've been ringing the bell for over ten minutes. I don't understand. He was here when I left... - Peter! The tape recorder! Perhaps he left us a message before going out. - "Meet me at Berstorf's Glassworks." - "Fine, I'll call a taxi." "No, I'll pick you up, in front of the Gilleleje Restaurant." Let's call Inspector Jansen. You're on your own now, Mr. Peter Oliver. You're all clone playing policeman. Quick! Block all the exits! Mr. Oliver, try to hold on! You're only a few meters from the ground! We'll be right there to help you! - Careful! - Hurry! Go! Go! Inspector, a man is trying to escape! Come quickly! - Peter! - Maestro! - Are you hurt? - No. Over here! Quick, over here! Please, let's go, Mr. Peter. There's no reason for you to stay here any longer. No, Burton. I need to know who that man is. I didn't recognize his voice. But, Mr. Peter... There are still too many things that aren't clear. - Go home and take Margot with you. I'll meet you there later. - But... - As you wish. - Please go, my dear. Don't worry about me. Give yourself up, Ballais! You can't escape now. - Look out, Ballais! Please, make yourself at home. You seem very anxious. Why don't you try to lie down for a while? - I'm going to park the car. - Thank you. - Is that you? Burton? Margot? Damn you, blind man! Frangoise Ballais! So, you're the killer! I figured it out when Margot found those pictures of you with Susan. You used to be friends in her circus days. You killed Paola... ...and then you had to kill Harry... ...and Helga, who found about the shawls... ...and Wendy and then Susan... ...who you used, and who was about to betray you... ...and now Margot! You're a monster! - Yes, I'm a monster. You can't see me, but my body was disfigured in that damn automobile accident! Only Victor knows my secret and Victor is mine! I won't let anyone take him away from me! Poor Victor. He thought he could protect you... ...and now he's dead! - No! It's not true! - Yes, and it's your fault! - No! You're a liar! Victor was your final victim. Liar! And now I'm going to kill you too, blind man! Freeze! You're under arrest! Step away, Mr. Oliver! No!
