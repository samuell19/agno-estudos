Please calm down. Florence Nightingale was a Victorian nurse. Her mission was essentially philanthropic. Okay, let's have one of you continue reading. Yes, Miss Teshigawara. Come on, Midori. Midori, he's picked you. Come on, wake up. Where's Midori, the Wild Chrysanthemum? Midori, some weird chick is asking for you. You can't come in here. Listen, you prick. Which one of these bitches is Midori? So you're Midori, are you? Come on Midori, wake up. Hey. What the hell? Someone wants you. Here we go. I make my formal greeting. I was born and raised in Chicken Valley. My father was a poultry farmer. From age seven, I slaughtered chickens, 444 in total. By name I am Red Malice, Yumi the Cockscomb. I hear your greeting in all its formality. I was born and raised in Cherry Town. Fighting has been my whole life. I skipped girlhood and went straight to delinquency. I am known as Invincible Midori, the Wild Chrysanthemum. I accept your challenge to a fight. Attack! Looks like I win! Bloodbath at Pinky High Accept my apologies. Forgive us. Anytime you want. I'm always ready for a fight. Rika Hoshimi Saya Kobayashi Asuka Misugi Yoko Fujimura Akari Asahina Asami Directed by Toshiya Kominami What a haul! Hey. What the hell. If it ain't Maki, the Lone Wolf. Hello there, Maki. Don't call me Maki any more. I challenge you to a fight. What? How many times is this? Since we were children, 153 times. I can't believe you. Here we go. That's enough. I've had a busy day, I'm tired. Maybe next time. Hey. If you're so tough, why aren't you running the school? It's a mess, what's the point? This way, I can do what I want. Spit it out, bitch, or you'll get more. Please stop hurting me. I want to know everything. This is what happens if you come into our territory. Got that, bitch? The Principal wants to see you. Sure. Bitch! Principal's Office Come in. Excuse me, sir. How are the new girls coming along? We're doing just as you asked, sir. Good. I'm glad to hear that. You've heard the school administrator is standing for election? Of course. He called to say he's coming here tonight. He's very busy preparing for the election. You understand, don't you? I have a suitable girl for him. Well done, Ranko. I have taught you well. I am reminded of how you first came here. Running away from your parent's abuse. Such a poor, frightened child. Oh, my dear Mr Principal. You know I will do anything for you. I got blood on my shoes. Hey, listen up. You missed something. You're only good for cleaning, so do it properly. Make her lick it clean. That's all she's good for. I've got a job for you tonight. Sewer Rat. I'm confident I'll win the election. I certainly hope so. That reminds me. Did you get one for me? Yes, I've arranged something special tonight. I think it's time I left you to get acquainted. That Maki doesn't give up, does she? She's been like that since she was a kid. Why the hell is she such a glutton for punishment? Well, here we are! - Wow! - What's this? A special cocktail I made for you. You're a good guy. Down the hatch! That's the way to drink. Midori, will you do me a favor? What now? Let me squeeze your tits. Don't push your luck. I love it when you do that. It's okay, don't be scared. Such lovely soft boobs. To me, you smell like a virgin. Let me check that out. That smell! The scent of a true virgin. Let me teach you about men. Principal! Mr Administrator! Get me an ambulance! Yes, sir. Why did you stop? I heard something outside. What on earth happened here? All my bottles are smashed. Midori, would you mind checking it out? Well... Please, Midori. Aren't you a man? Please, for me. Did you do this? I was inside, maybe it was you. It wasn't me. This will take forever to clean up. There, all finished. What on earth were you doing out there? I'm sorry. Wipe that smile off your face. Look what you did to me. I'm so sorry. I must ask you for another favor. Can I please stay here tonight? Of course, you can stay as long as you like. You pervert. That's right. I do like my perversions. Hang on. Don't I know you from somewhere? You're one of Ranko's Demons, aren't you? You are. You're in Ranko's Demon gang. We don't want Demons here. Please, I beg you. They're after me. If they catch me, I'm dead. That's the problem. We don't want any trouble with the Demons. So she's here? Thanks for catching our Sewer Rat. Come to our den later if you want payment. We don't want your money. Take her. In that case, we will. On your feet, bitch. Leader! Help me! That's enough. What? This is our den. You weren't invited, you have no right to take her. Do you realize you're talking to Ranko's Demons? I don't care who you are. There are rules to be observed. Not now, Midori. Will you challenge me? If you win, you can take her. But if I win, she stays and you never come back. What's that? If you're a gang leader, you can't refuse a fight. You'll regret this. I can't watch this. Please Midori. Are you okay? Get lost. Surrender, or I'll cut your goddamn nipples off. Had enough? No way. You're a goner. I'm gonna win this fight. No way, bitch! Looks like I win. Fantastic! Well done, Midori. You were terrific! Such grace. She doesn't know when to stop. Time for you to leave. Please make me your disciple. I have finally found my true leader. Help me! Please, no. Help me. You lucky girl. Midori is the best leader. Sorry, no. I can't accept your pledge. Put it on my bill. Thanks again. Midori, you've never forgotten, have you? What? Never forgotten what? Well, that time... I'm out of here. How dare you let her defeat you? I'm so sorry. If this scandal gets out, my political career is ruined. I leave it to you. I'm so sorry. I'll make sure she disappears. It's up to you to get rid of Midori and her gang. I'll make sure no cops interfere. You kill them, you hear me? Yes, sir. I'm doing this out of love. Ranko! You again? Good things will happen if you take me in. I'll be your slave, I'll do anything for you. I'll go through fire and rain if that's what you want. You don't have that kind of courage. How do you know? Let me prove it to you. Okay, then. Shall I test you out? Follow me. I want to see you deflower yourself. Or are you too scared? We don't let virgins join our gang. If you're too scared, no way you can be in our gang. I can do it. Use your fingers. Leader! Help me. Okay, you have courage. But there's no way I can let you join. I don't deserve to have you. So you're awake? Midori asked me to watch over you. She always asks too much of me. No matter what you do, you'll never be her disciple. Why are you so sure about that? Midori still carries a wound deep in her heart. A deep wound? Yes, once before she had a disciple. She really liked that kid. Even more than old pals like me. But that poor girl got gang-raped and she ended up dead. Midori was there, but she couldn't do anything. Since then, Midori swore she'd never take another disciple. You're wasting your time. Give up. But if you ever tell Midori what I said, she'll kill me. Is she okay? She said she wanted to be alone for a while. That happens when you lose your cherry. Hopefully, she'll stop hanging around us now. What the hell? Like moths to a flame. You're too careless. Stan now. Now it's my turn to get you. What? Strip her. Stop it. Keep still. What the hell is this for? Not there. What are you planning to do? I'm going to teach you to behave yourself. No Principals puppet like you can teach me anything. You'll soon change your tune. Check her out! Midori. Don't worry, your next. Full power is next. Well, well. If it isn't little Harue. You came here to die? You betrayed me. Get ahold of her. Let go of that cable. Good girl. You bitch. My body is still tingling. Those crazy bitches. I need a drink. Shall we go to the bar? Yeah, let's go. Come, we'll buy you a drink to thank you. I won't die. I've never die. Please make me your disciple. Sorry, kid. No more disciples for me. It's too much responsibility. But how about we become friends? Okay? Thank you, Dear Leader. Don't call me that. Can you handle 10 shots of tequila? You wanna try? Right, that's decided. Yes, next fight we'll get 5,000 times revenge. We're not scared of them. What's the plan? Listen, I've got a great idea. Attention good citizens of this town. I am Yoshitaro Hamaguchi. I promise I will bring clean and honorable politics to this area. Neither rain, nor wind, nor bribes can drive me away. Please give me your vote to this most pure politician! Are you my new campaign girl? Oh, my, you're such a sweetie. No other politician is as honorable as he. I run a bar. Can you come over tonight? Yes, I'll definitely come for you. Bring all your powerful friends. Yes, we'll definitely be coming. This is where you'll find the bar. I'll be waiting for you. Bar Midori Welcome to our Happening Bar Midori. Please come this way. Well, here we are. I love schoolgirls in sailor suits! Gentlemen, you're free to do as you please! Drink all you want and play all you want. Let's go! Oh, she's so smooth and tight. Lovely boobs. I can't control myself. Oh, I just love that! I'll take a few shots as mementos. Photographs? Yes, and they're free. Free are they? I'll just hide my face. Who cares about your face? Okay, let's go. Here we go. Say cheese. Okay, one over here. Never show these to anyone. Of course not. Here I go. Say cheese. One more. Say cheese. What the hell is going on? I had no idea. You're supposed to be in charge of her. Here's a special school announcement. You saw what these adults get up to in secret. You all saw the photographs. These filthy pigs spend our school budget on women and drink. These same animals are always attacking their own students. Some of our classmates have been raped by them. Ladies and fellow schoolmates. Do you think you can ever forgive these filthy beasts... who attack and rape their very own students? It's time for us to rebel. Everyone meet at the Principal's Office! Mr Principal... Yes? It's all over. Do you realize the trouble you're in now? Shut up, Fatty. You start, Harue. No! What are you doing? I'm gonna burn your cock off. You're next, Principal. Don't! I haven't had meat like this for ages. All paid for from the Administrator's wallet. We must thank him for this. Our plan was a success. We give our thanks! I love sukiyaki. - Leave some meat. - You, too. Come on, you have some, too. Principal. I'm here to save you. I don't care if the whole world attacks you. I'm always here to help you. I'm disappointed with you. You were unable to prevent this. You're of no use to me now. Don't say that. Don't you love me? You do, don't you? I have never loved you. Principal... It's time those girls were taught a serious lesson. This is what happens when you attack adults. Over this way. Look at this. I'm a rocket. You won't join in? I'm not sure what to do. What do you mean? I don't know how to play. I've always been bullied, even in the orphanage. And they've always called me Sewer Rat. I thought if I joined a gang, I could make myself stronger. And once I was strong, I could kill those who taunted me. But it turned out differently. Nothing's changed, I'm still a Sewer Rat. I still have to hang my head in shame. Why did you want to be my disciple? I think it's because you never grovel to anyone. And I wanted to be just like you. I'm sorry, I said too much. Listen, Harue. You're no Sewer Rat. You're a woman, you have a heart. Dear Leader... You have guts. Let's go play with them. Save some for us! Let's go! Inagaki Gang Headquarters Are we out of drugs? Yes, we sold everything. I can't do cold-turkey! Hi. What? My brother! It's been too long. What brings you here so suddenly? Should a school principal visit gangsters? What happened? I have a job for you. What job? Teach some kids a lesson. Give some schoolgirls something they'll never forget. Well? Listen, my big brother. I dream of work like that. Midori, the Wild Chrysanthemum. You again? You listen to me, Midori. I challenge you to a fight. Beautiful smell, isn't it? That's the smell of sweet young girls. Try it. You smell that pussy? Then let's at 'em! It's rare for Midori to miss school. Checkmate. Who are you? What a lot of naughty girls you are! Who the hell are you? This is a girls school. It's sacred. She's right. You're full of beans. This feels good. This feels really good. What the hell are you doing to my friend? My gang owns this school now. Okay boys, grab yourself some pussy. Don't fight it. You'll enjoy it, girl. What the hell? We've got to escape. Come on. You're dripping wet, you are! Use your tongue. Who the hell are they? Just watch yourself! Go back to your class now. Come on, wake up, girl. I'll teach you a lesson. Here I go! Good shot. Tell me where Midori is, or you're in big trouble. I'll break your bones. Here I go. Watch me put my back into it. Very impressive. Watch closely. Here I go. Now for her face. Right in the face. Here I go. Stop. I'll take their place. Let them go and you can do what you want to me. Harue, no... What do you say? Go for it. Okay, it's a deal. You two get Midori in here. Come on, bitch. Harue, no... I'm no Sewer Rat, you watch me change! Harue... Get out of here! I'll beat you like I always do. If I don't kill you, I'll lose the Principal forever. If I take your head, he will love me again. Stop talking nonsense. Fight fair, bitch. There are no rules in a fight to the death. Here we go. Do you give up? Here I go again. Now are you going to tell me where Midori is? I'll never tell you. What was that? I'll never tell you. Say it again. Get lost you creep! Shut up, bitch! Who the hell do you think you are? I'll do anything to get the Principal back! That rotten scumbag? He's no scumbag! He's the one who rescued me from my abusive parents. He's only using you. You're wrong! You don't understand. He used to love me. He said so. No mistake. I did everything for him. I did everything I could to make him happy. Now I've lost him and I have only darkness. If I lose him forever, how can I survive? You stupid bitch. It's not only you. You're not the only one to suffer. The world is a mess, all is darkness. Even the lowest of the low are fighting to survive. So cut it out. Stop with your stupid moaning and crying. Shut up, bitch! What's so funny? The school is Hell now. The Principal's brother is a gangster and he's ransacking the place. What? Nothing you can do will stop them. Nothing you do can save your friends. Midori! I've done what I can. The rest is up to them. Harue... What about her? Harue is... I'll go with you. I can't let them get away with it. Wait up. You think I'll get in your way? Sure, you always beat me in our fights. But you've never beaten my spirit. Are you listening? I'll go by myself. Whatever happens, I have to save Harue. Midori... Who the hell are you? Come with me. So, Midori, the Wild Chrysanthemum, you finally came. Where's Harue? Answer me, where is she? Here she is. Harue. Come any closer and I'll smash her skull to pieces. You stinking bastard. You humiliated me, you little bitch. I've thought long and hard about how to punish you. Finally, I know how to do it. Killing all your friends is what will hurt you most. My eyes! Harue. Harue. Leader, have I changed? Yes, you are stronger than anyone. Hey. Never! You've been a real pain in my ass. But I win. It's all over. Let's go. Yes, Boss. I know, I shouldn't give in. Right? Wait up. Are you immortal? Stop looking at me! Are you a monster? I was born and raised in Cherry Town. Fighting has been my whole life. I skipped girlhood and went straight to delinquency. What are you saying? Life is full of suffering. Many nights are filled with tears. Many ordeals must be overcome. But I've never regretted the way I lived. I am the student gang leader of the Seijun Girls School. I am the Invincible Midori, the Wild Chrysanthemum. Look closely. I'm going out with a bang! I am known as Invincible Midori, the Wild Chrysanthemum. I accept your challenge to a fight.
