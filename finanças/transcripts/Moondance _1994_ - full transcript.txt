- Last one home has to cook. - No chance. [LAUGHS] Is that the best you can do? [BARKING] Come on. [BARKING] [GASPS] [LAUGHING] Ishka! - Our lunch. - Leave it. Ishka. [BARKING] [BARKING] [BARKING] [BARKING] What's that supposed to be? Eat it. - It was your fault. - Eeew. Dogfish. [ISHKA GROWLING] - Ishka. - [BARKS] Do ya think we could race her? I can't see any dog gettin' the better of her, can you? If we won loads of races, we'd buy a boat and sail to Africa to see Mum. I bet they've never seen a greyhound in Africa before. After Africa, we could go to... Uzbekistan. We'd race her all over the world, and we'd win bags of money. It'd be brilliant, wouldn't it? If she was a champion, you'd realize what we have in our hands. Patrick? What? What do we have in our hands then? A hot potato. [SHOUTING] [LAUGHING] Faster! Faster! [SHOUTING] PATRICK: Oh, my God. Father McGrath. - Hello, Father McGrath. - Ah, Patrick. - Now let me see. - [ISHKA GROWLING] - Your face is familiar, but... - [BARKING] Dominic. Holy Moses. I hardly recognized ya. It's been so long since you graced us with your presence at school. I'm sorry Dominic hasn't been in school very much recently. I rest you don't bother your head about it. It's only an education he's missing... and only the rest of his life he'll make a bollocks of. - [BELL TOLLING] - Excuse me Latin. Actually, Aunt Dorothy has decided I'm being wasted at National School. She enrolled me as a boarder in St.Jude's. Has she now? Saint Jude patron saint of hopeless cases. How appropriate. Well, all I can say is good luck to your new teachers. DOMINIC: It's you who needs luck, preacher. Let him go, brother, this time. Okay, where were we? [CHUCKLES] - [ISHKA HOWLING] - In trouble. - ["GUNSHOTS'"] - [IMITATING GUNS BLASTING] ["HORSE NEIGHING"] ["RIFLE BLASTS"] ["GUNSHOTS" CONTINUE] ["HORSE NEIGHS"] ["GUNSHOTS" CONTINUE] [PANTING] You call that giving cover? You call that running? - I got a great idea of where we should go next. - I don't wanna hear it. - You'll change your mind when I tell ya. - Shut up. - Okay. - No more ideas. I never wanna hear any more ideas again. - Okay. - All right. Ireland. Let's go to Ireland. I thought deep down you really wanted to hear it. - They speak English there. - They do? - And they got horses and beaches. - No swimming. And banks, lots of banks. I'll think about it. You take the ones on the right. I'll take the ones on the left. Hey, wait a second. You didn't see Preacher McGrath out there, did you? - Preacher McGrath, no. - Good. For a moment there I thought we were in trouble. - ["GUNSHOTS"] - ["MAN SHOUTING"] Wouldn't it be brilliant if people stopped livin' in houses altogether? [CHUCKLES] Absolutely. [LAUGHS] [CHUCKLES] [DISGUSTED SIGH] What's that ridiculous sign? "No entry." Come on. We'll try the side door. [ISHKA BARKING] Of course a difficult choice for their mother: to look after her sons or live with an obscure tribe in Africa. Mind you, the boys appear to be living like savages. Katherine will soon be able to write a book about them. Where are they? Patrick? Dominic? [LOUD BREATHS BLOWING OUT OF TUBE] - [GASPS] - [LAUGHING] [LAUGHING CONTINUES] Patrick? Dominic? - [BARKING] - Oh, God. Aunt Dracula. What's she doin' out? - The sun hasn't gone down yet. - Better get some garlic. Father McGrath and I had a little chat. I've been in touch with St.Joseph's. Excellent record... with certain children. Really? Look, he'd meet boys of his own age. He can always come home at weekends. He wouldn't be happy carted off to some school. - You tried that before and look what happened. - Ah, there you are. Patrick, this is Anya. She's helping me with the horses for the summer. [RUMBLING, BANGING] How nice to see you. How have you been? Patrick. It's very bright in here. Don't you think it's bright, Aunt Dorothy? Should I, uh... draw the curtain? - Dominic. - Yes, Patrick? Why don't you show Anya the garden. Delighted. - Have you heard from your mother? - She wrote a few weeks ago. She said to send you her love. Did she think to send money? Uh, we're all right for money. [CHUCKLES] Your car? - Come on. I want to introduce you to Ishka. - [BARKING] - What's that? - Lobster pods. Hello, Ishka. I'm Anya. Ishka's a beautiful name. Means " water" in Irish. Mom rescued her from the river when she was just a pup. Ishka. We're going to race her soon. This is my special pet. Oh. Nice. Are you going to race her too? But this is exactly what I saw last time. He's a bit behind, but I know he can catch up. [DOMINIC, ANYA LAUGHING] It's all right. You've nothing to hide. But it's none of her business! Your education is my business! Your brother and I have decided it's time you went to boarding school. I haven't said any such thing. That's no answer. - I promise I'll start doin' lessons with him. - For heaven's sake! You left school at his age. How could you possibly teach him anything? I know it's none of my business, but I could come and give Dominic lessons. That's a brilliant idea. It's very kind of you, Anya, but I don't... But it would be good for me also. I need to practice my English. As long as Dominic doesn't mind teaching me. Anya! You're late. I've waited for hours. [CHUCKLES] Hours? Well, it felt like hours. I still have to help with the horses. I don't think your aunt... - Don't say her name. Not in front of the poor animal. - [LAUGHS] Can I get up? Mom used to ride out here every morning. - Is she really living with a tribe in Africa? - Yeah. She was the first white person they ever saw. She's gonna write a book and become famous when she gets back. Come on! [LOUD BUZZING] You said you liked mashed potatoes. [DRILL WINDING DOWN] How's school? I think Dominic's enjoying it. No, Anya, I can't. You have no money: I have. It's simple. What if I take something for it? What? I'll think of something. Come on. What year? I told you the answer five minutes ago. History is useless. Who cares when some king defeated some other king in some field... for some stupid reason or other? So far you refuse to do math, geography... - Boring. - and now history. It's stupid. What does it all matter? Dominic, you're impossible. - [ISHKA BARKING] - Anya, I know. [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] [PANTING] - Well, where'd you get it? - Off Killmore. [PANTING CONTINUES] Geez, he was fast. But Ishka kept with him all the way. You should have seen her. Poor hare. Poor dead hare. Ink by itself. This, though dead... See ya tomorrow. Come on. Look. [CHUCKLES] Poor lobsters. You must be bringing us luck, Anya. Can you show me how to row? Sure. [GIGGLES] Man overboard! I can't swim! ANYA: Neither can we. [THUNDER RUMBLING] PATRICK: Ah, no. The princess of darkness. DOMINIC: I bet she'll be really, really pleased to see us. Anya, where have you been? You said you'd be back for dinner. Look. We got you a lobster. For God's sake! Well, put it in the boat and get into the car. - Hurry up! - No, I want to ride back. Don't be ridiculous. Dominic! - It's too dark now. - I'll race ya. [CLICKS TONGUE] Dominic! - [TIRES SCREECHING] - Watch it! Ya-a-a-a! You're lucky you didn't break your bloody neck. No doubt your mother would applaud such recklessness, but I don't. Get your things. We're going. I think I will stay. [SIGHS] Oh, I see. You two didn't waste any time. - Just typical! - It's not what you're thinkin'. I don't want to hear another word. - Get into the car. - I'm not going back. I want to stay. [STIFLED CHUCKLE] [ENGINE STARTS] You did it, Anya! You stood up to Aunt Dracula! [ANYA LAUGHING] You're like an angel of mist. [ALL LAUGHING, WHOOPING] ANYA: Faster! Faster! [ALL SHOUTING] [ISHKA BARKING] ANYA: Speed up! Speed up! So how's that one fit you then, Murty, huh? Once again, John Joe, I'd never settle in this yoke. Take your time, Murty. Take your time. You'll be long enough dead. [CHUCKLES] [BELL ON DOOR JINGLES] How are ya, John Joe? I need the order made up. Uh-huh. Don't go away. [ANYA GIGGLING] There ya go. A guest over at Roslare, huh? Must be a great attraction for you young fellas to have a woman about the place. Does you not all get bored in the evenings? How do you keep yourselves occupied at all? Can't think for the life of me... what you get up to. I thought in a place like this... most people spent the whole night fucking. [GASPS] What are we going to do for money? I'll think of something. We'll think of something. [GRASSHOPPER CHIRPING] [CHIRPING CONTINUES] Would you... [EXHALES] If I... What? Oh, no. [CHUCKLES] Say it. Mm-hmm. I just wanna say... Hey! Wait for me! At the funeral... Dominic kept singing this nursery rhyme over and over. Nobody could stop him. When I asked him why... he just said that Dad was tellin' him to. Even now he still believes he saw Dad here. He was only six. Must've been terrible for you and your mother, being left alone. She just took off and left us. I had to leave school to look after Dominic. She just comes back when it suits her. Upsets everything... and then leaves. So why do we make a bonfire? PATRICK: Summer Solstice. The Church calls it St.John's Day... to try and pretend we're not all pagans. But we are. - [ALL LAUGHING] - ♪♪ [IRISH] [GIGGLES] [GIGGLING CONTINUES] - Promise me you won't run away. - Promise. [ALL LAUGHING] [DOOR OPENING] [WHIMPERING] [MUTTERING] Mom! Mom, you're back! [SIGHS] And not a moment too soon. Past noon and not a child in the house washed. Hello, Patrick. Hello. They've just got hangovers. We had a party last night. I got drunk too. This is Anya. She's livin' with us. Livin' with you? [LAUGHS] I see. You thought because us and Anya in bed... you thought we were... no... And then Anya looked at her and said, "I think I will stay here." [CHUCKLING] Anyone who can stand up to Aunt Dracula is all right with me. How long are you to stay this time? A few days? - Can you stay long? - Yes, I can. I'm back for good. Hey, Anya! [CHUCKLES] A little bit of Africa in the west of Ireland. What's wrong, Patrick? I just wished she hadn't come along, that's all. [SIGHS] You know, just when things were goin' so good. Your mother has nothing to do with us. just because I like her doesn't change how I feel for you. You don't know her. She'll mess up everything. I love you, Patrick. You have to leave soon, don't you? I'm supposed to start the university. Marry me, Anya. - What? - I'm serious. [ANYA LAUGHING] - What's wrong with the way things are now? - Well, nothing. It's just that gettin' married seems the right thing to do. You do realize she'll be my sister. Next thing you'll be making me a bloody uncle. - Havin' kids. - Slow down. Give us a chance. Listen, Dominic, this doesn't change anything. I'll think about it. How long? [BIRDS SQUAWKING] I made you a wedding present. This is your bridal chamber. Dominic, you're hurting me. Stop it! You can't treat me like a kid! You can't! I'll tell you one thing, Anya. You'll be my bride too. [DOOR OPENS] [CLOSES] I love Patrick. I don't want to hurt him. But why do we have to rush into this? Oh, God, I feel sick, and I can't find my other stocking. I'm going to run away. Running away isn't the answer, believe me. You end up having to face the very thing you fled from. [SIGHS] Calm down. Calm down. Don't be ridiculous. How can I be calm? I'm about to be married. Thanks. - ANYA: Patrick? - Anya. - I have something to tell you. - Where the hell have you been? - Nowhere. - Nowhere? How could you just... Please! Anya, what is it? I can't do it. I can't marry you. What? What do ya mean? I just need a little more time. I don't understand. Why do you feel like this now? What's happened? - It's you, isn't it? What's she been saying? - Nothing. You couldn't keep out of it, could ya? I should've bloody known you'd try and come between us, just like with me and Dominic! - It really isn't like that. - It's not her fault. Please, listen to me! - Patrick! - What is it? Do you get pleasure wandering in and out of our lives... like some hurricane destroying everything in sight? I was wrong to leave, but you can't blame me for coming back. Yes, I can! We were fine without you! Just go away and leave us alone! - Let's not do this... - Ah, shut up! [DOOR SLAMS] Patrick, wait. God. Try to understand. I'm sorry, Patrick.

And anyway... you'd miss each other too much. If I did go, would you be all right? You'd have to promise to visit me whenever I got too lonely. Of course I would. I love you, Dominic. I really do.

Rose! - [ISHKA BARKING] Rose! [GIGGLING] - [ROSE SHOUTING] - [SHOUTING] [BOTH LAUGHING] - You look great! What did you do with your hair? - Hello, boys. Welcome to Dublin: the city of saints and sinners. Murphy's been at the game a long time now. And it's his opinion that what you've got here is some class of a dog. [DOGS BARKING] - It's not that bad. - [WHIMPERING] Believe it or not, all the dogs love it here. [WHIMPERING CONTINUES] [BARKING CONTINUES] He's never been away from us before. Greyhounds love racin' one another. It's in their blood. And Murph, he's rapid with 'em. - [WHIMPERING] - Honest. We'll give her a trial in a couple of days, okay? [WHIMPERS] It's right above the pub, so you never need go short of a drink. ROSE: Come on, Dominic. You're gonna love it. Needs a little bit of tidyin' up, ya know. - Well, what do you think of the place? - It's perfect! We were only too glad to offer you the position... on the recommendation of Mr. Murphy. - A marvelous man. - Marvelous man. Yeah, he is. I must try and think of a way of repayin' him... for settin' me up. We've had all the burning lights of Christianity through our door. Oh, they've all graced us. Billy Graham. - Mother Teresa. - His Holiness. The Reverend Jackson. [DISGUSTED SIGH] Yes, uh, you'll meet them all here, Patrick. It's a lovely occupation. And, of course, the marvelous thing is... it's guaranteed. Not many jobs can boast that now, can they, Mr. Dunbar? They cannot. As you've said before, Mr. Dunwoody... the day religion goes out of business is the day hell freezes over. Marvelous. Marvelous. [WOLF WHISTLE] I suppose a ride would be out of the question? [CHUCKLES] Ya never know, Murphy. [GIGGLING] Can I come up for a while, love? [CHUCKLES] - Thanks very bleedin' much. - [ANYA LAUGHING] Is that how they ride in Germany? So, now hold me. Mmm. MURPHY: Okay, boys. Come on, Ishka. I'm countin' on ya so I can retire early. Ready, set... go! - Get back on your heelers! - ANYA: Ishka! [ALL CHEERING, SHOUTING] Come on! Come on, Ishka! Come on! Come on, you beautiful baby! Come on! Come on! PATRICK: Damn it. I thought Ishka had her beat. She nearly did it, and she was me vest dog. Ishka's a prospect, definitely. - You really think so? - It's just a matter of trainin'. - Cheer up. It's her first trial. - I wanted her to win, Chalk. [ROSE SHOUTING] We'll be rich! [CHEERING] Maybe Ishka will let you retire early. Nobody retires from Dunbar and Dunwoody. - They merely ascend to a higher plain. - Heaven? No, upstairs to " clerical outfit." Hey! Where are ya goin'? - CHALKY: Oi! - Chalky. What do you have to walk around this cape for, huh? Even the girls don't come down here. Come on. Get in. We told you never to walk home this way, didn't we? Bleedin' conscience. [CAR BACKFIRES] Poxy bleedin' car. CHALKY: There she is, Boswell: my escape from this poxy place. Your family know you're goin'? They couldn't give a bollocks. Me dad will only miss me now when he's tryin' to get some money out of me for drink. It's not like you, with Patrick and Anya. Imagine. Sailin' to South America. Bollocks to that. Let's get pissed. - Take it easy. - [CHUCKLES] You'll wake Anya. Reflexes are gone. It's all these late nights you're keepin'. You just rest now while I go earn us a livin'. [GROANS] Has Patrick gone to work? Hours ago. I brought you some tea. What are you gonna do today? Cut your hair. It's funny, but it's beginning to feel like when you were teaching me... back in Roslare. Do you like it? Now you must come back to see us next week. We have a lovely new Saint Francis coming in. - Ah! - Yes, in several sizes. So, with the 2,000 candles, ten statues and 21 paintings... - the total comes to £4,600. - Fine. Now, send the bill to The Little Daughters of the Poor, Dock A. Good Lad. Come on. Come on. We haven't much time. That's grand, grand, grand. [MUTTERS] Uh-uh. I missed... Good girl, now. Thank you very much. - God bless, now. Bye. - God bless. Good-bye, Sister. Thank goodness. I thought they'd never go. I have a souffle in the oven. [GIGGLING] Catch it! [BARKING] - Hey, Patrick. Taking her for a run? - Yeah. Race is comin' up. Haven't seen Dominic, have you? - I was supposed to meet him here. - No. He hasn't been around for a while now.

Who do you think you are tellin' me what to do? - You're not my father. - No, I'm not, thank Christ. It's a bloody shame it's Chalky leavin' next week, not you. Before we start, I'd just like to say a few words... about our guest of honor, Chalky. You know, things are just not gonna be the same around here without you, Chalky. I've never had anybody before who could handle the dogs so... so elegantly. [CHUCKLES] Run, ya bollocky horse! [CHUCKLES] - You've taught me all I bleedin' know, Murph. - Ta-da!

[IMITATING POPE] Murphy, I'm confused. How come an ugly bastard like you has such a beautiful girlfriend like Rose? And I say, "Simple, your holiness. I've balls like a stallion and a neck like a jockey's bollocks." When do you set sail? Two days after the race. - Do you not like the lobster? - No, it's lovely. Great. Murph went to a lot of trouble cookin' this. The least you can do is eat. - Sorry, I have to go. - You're not goin'. What about the lobster? - I'll take it, all right? - The lobster stays. - Honestly, lads, that's... - And the claw. The claw stays. - The lobster doesn't mean that much to me. - And the bib! The bib stays! There! Now you have everything! CHALKY: Sail her back to bleedin' Germany. You can't go on like this. It's crazy. - Chalky. - What? You think there's any way I could get a job on board? Look, I doubt it... but I'll ask, all right? CHALKY: You know, if Ishka gets out of the traps cleanly tomorrow... I reckon she'll win. [CROWD MURMURING] MURPHY: Gangway. Make room for the drink. MURPHY: To Ishka. Here's to Ishka. So, what did he say? You're too young. It's a big risk. If Skipper gets caught with you on board, fuck goes his license. - How much does he want? - Five hundred. Here. Put it on Ishka. If she wins, you'll have enough. Thanks. [CROWD MURMURING] [BELL RINGING] - Come on. There you go. - [WHINING] [BELL RINGING] [CROWD CHATTERING] [CROWD CHEERING] Come on, Ishka! - Come on. - ANYA: Ishka, Come on! PATRICK: Come on, Ishka.
