All through this week I've brought you six beautiful models. One of them just behind the DJ. Look. Ah, I see. Yes, you know what? She's your comper-trait. A compatriot eh? Compatriot, yes. Yes, right. Well you'll have to introduce me. Maybe a little later. Maybe during our wonderful dinner. Of course, why not. Jean Pierre! Jean Pierre! Here I am, sir! Is the buffet ready? It's ready sir, everything is as you wish, sir. What do you say, shall we eat? Sure. Why did you bring me here? There's nothing weird going on here. I'd rather just stay home and play video games instead. I heard the mayor's daughter's gonna be here amongst all the models. Think of it, that is amazing news. You know, McDoll will have to pay a large amount of money if he wants those pictures. Fine, I'll stay here for one more hour. If nothing happens by then, I'm out of here. I'm gonna go home and play video games. Plus there are so many mosquitoes. Oh dude, you got a right one right on your cheek. No. Hold on. Ow, that hurt! Are you all right dude? 'Cause that was a pretty big one. I think I saved your life there. Yeah, sure. Very big one. So where you from again? Aberdeen. Aberdeen? Yes. Well I'm from Edinburgh. Capital of Scotland, you ever been there? No. No? It's a beautiful city. And you're a beautiful woman. What's your age again? I'm 23. 23, 23. And you? Me? You know, I think we should be dancing by now. Don't you? Where's the music? Don't you see? There's nothing weird and scandalous going on here. It looks more like my granddad's care center. Yeah, you're right. It is getting quite late. I guess we should call it a night. Oh wait, is that who I think it is? No way! Is that her? Dude! Dude, amazing! Quickly, shoot, shoot, come on... Stop hitting me! Shoot it shoot it shoot it shoot it, come on. Dude, yes! Yes, come on. All right, perfect. Perfect. I told you. Great, good job. Your coffee, sir. Thank you. What is this stuff? It's cold. Take it away. Oh god. Monsieur, the newspaper. And was breakfast satisfactory? I would say no. No, the pineapple's too ripe, the coffee was disgusting. And the newspaper's crumpled, obviously it's been opened and read. Did you open the newspaper and read it? I would never do it sir, but if you'd like, tomorrow before I bring it to you, I could iron it. Please, don't be smart. Now this morning I intend to be out on the boat with my notary, Mr. Bloom. When I return I'd like you to be prepared for my usual walk. Excellent. Please. Do something about those shoes. They are extremely irritating. Right away, sir. My friend Shawn. I wanna toast a long and great friendship and successful enterprise together. Now I'll add to that to beautiful women and the good life. Oh man, you're obsessed, you know that? With the women and the toys. Shhh, not so loud. The taxmen have ears everywhere. He filthy rich! All right, I'm just well off! How about your daughters, have you seen them lately? You mean the three women that just wanna spend my heritage? They hardly ever call. Maybe that's better that way. That's pretty mean, buddy. Ever since their mother died, that beautiful woman, my angel Bridgette, they haven't wanted to stay in touch, they hardly ever call. How about your granddaughters? You see your granddaughters? My grandchildren? They play at their home, I play at mine. Shame. The loser buys dinner. Okay? Where? Michelle's. Who are those two guys? Did you pay elves for security? No no, they must be on the end of the ship, I never saw those fellas before. Oh look at this. Checkmate. Get outta here. You lose. Make a reservation at Michelle's. Who's paying? You lose, you pay. I didn't. Jean Pierre, this is exactly what I needed. Air, exercise, beautiful day. Beautiful day. Jean Pierre! Pass me that energy drink. Jean Pierre! Stop your singing. Come on. Oh, Monsieur! Monsieur! Just hold still, monsieur. Okay? Ow. I don't know why I haven't fired you yet. You're such an incompetent. Didn't you see that tree? Didn't you? Monsieur, actually it was you that didn't see the tree, I wanted to warn you, but you were too fast and... Enough. You weren't paying attention. What were you thinking, huh? Actually I was thinking about... You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna withhold this month's salary. That's what I'm gonna do. What? I'm gonna hold back your salary. Again? Yeah. But monsieur... Come on, let's go check out my toys in the garage. Come with me. Move it. To my toys. To my toys, to my toys, to my toys. Come in! Hi Arman. Hi Zander. I'm almost done. Yeah, I'm almost done, just a few things to do. Wow, you printed all the photos? Yeah, kinda. Just some photos we did for McDoll. I'm gonna be delivering the envelope and everything tonight myself. Yes, yes yes. You say 4 o'clock, is that right? 4 o'clock. Stefan, have you ever heard such a thing in all the years I've been around? Mr. Bloom, shall I contact Mr. McDoll for tomorrow? Why don't you leave the gevalting to me. All right sir. I'll speak to Shawn myself. Okay, let's go. I'll go get the wine. Monsieur. Where's my jasmine rice? I will go check, sir. And where is my wine? I'm going to have to fire everybody I guess. I'm going, I'm going. Here it is, sir! Here you are, sir. Chilled as you like it, sir. There you are, sir. Freezing. And... Terrible. Yes, we must save. What people must do in these terrible times, but this boxed wine is disgusting. Tomorrow I'd like you to get a Beaujolais. One bottle. It's cheap, but I can drink it. Of course, sir. It's a shame. How do people with four, five, six children? I don't know, sir. I can't imagine having a house with children running around. Animals. No. Here it is. Matilda, perhaps you could peel me half an apple. Save the other half for tomorrow. Hear that? Just half an apple, okay? Enjoy your meal, sir. Have now, half in the fridge. Excuse me, sir. Why won't he let me call the locksmith to fix the button? Sure it doesn't bother him, he's not the one running up and down in the middle of the night. Who are you? I'm Arman from Arman Inc. News Agency. And this, this must be delivered personally to Mr. McDoll. Don't ask questions. I'll be back when the time is right. Goodbye sir. So who would bother us at this time of night? Monsieur, it was a... A what? A... A little... A little what? Chipmunk? Dog, cat? A child, sir, a kid actually, sir. What would a child be doing out at this time? Oh. Yes, he told me to give you this personally, sir. What is this? What are these? Who took these? I don't know sir, I told you I was given them by a child, sir. You do realize if these pictures got around, it wouldn't make a good impression of you, sir. What you're trying to tell me is that someone is trying to blackmail me. This one is actually pretty funny. Please! Don't laugh. We would never dare, sir. I denounce anyone who tries to blackmail me. I don't care who they are. Sir, you need to... I have to think. Who could have taken those pictures? Mr. McDoll's house, who is this? Of course Mr. Bloom, I'll patch you through immediately. Monsieur. What? What do you want? It's the notary Bloom on the phone, he insisted. Oh, Mr. Bloom. I always have time for Mr. Bloom. Albert, how are you? Please, I hope you're not going to ask me for money because I am worried that... No no no, go ahead, talk to me. Albert, you've done this joke before. There is no inheritance for me. Really? Wait, wait, you want me there at 4? I'll be in your office at 4. I won't be late, I promise. Is everything all right, sir? I've just received a great inheritance. I can't believe it. But I wonder who sent that money. I had a very rich uncle from Argentina. A distant relative of my mother when I was a child. He was so stingy. He was stingy? Jean Pierre, get the car ready. Let's go. Sir, I note that your appointment is in five hours. Are you contradicting me? Is that what you want is for me to fire you? Is that what you want? He always says it. But he doesn't. What are you two mumbling about? Nothing, monsieur. Let's go. Jean Pierre, you get the car. You seem very excited. I am. You seem very happy. I am, I am. Another beautiful day in paradise. Shawn. My dear friend. Have a seat. You can't imagine how excited I am to be here. Well knowing you pretty good, I can imagine. I was desperate, I was getting these messages about some people took photos of me and I think they were threatening, but no, no, it doesn't matter, this is why I'm here, this is important. So please tell me. This inheritance, what is it, millions, billions? It really is not that kind of inheritance. No? No. Am I going to be extremely rich? Aren't you extremely rich right now? No, not really. Yes you are. Then what is it, houses? Castles, yachts? How long since you saw your daughters? My daughters? I don't know, months, years. What does that have to do with this now? Well the inheritance is directly related to them. Did something happen to them? I don't know. What then? What's happening? You'll see. Hello, Stefan, please come on in here. This is your inheritance. Grandpa! Grandpa! Grandpa! Grandpa! Grandpa! Grandpa! Shawn, these are your grandchildren. Say hello to grandchildren and the three puppies. Grandpa! Grandpa! Grandpa! Are you okay, buddy? Grandpa! Grandpa! Grandpa! Grandpa! Grandpa! He is awake. I'm so glad it's you. I had a terrible dream. How do you feel sir? Not so well. Not so well, I dreamt I was in Mr. Bloom's office. And I was thrilled. I received a great inheritance. Actually, monsieur... I look and it was kids. So, so many kids. And dogs too. What a nightmare. Monsieur. What? I'm sorry to disappoint you monsieur, but it wasn't a dream. What? We've been invaded by many of your relatives. Some less and others more hairy. No. No. Oh my god, this can't be true! It can't be true, tell me it's not real! Unfortunately monsieur, this is all very real. Where are they now? I didn't have any instructions of yours, so I locked them in the garage. Oh my god... No, not in the garage! Not with all my beautiful toys! You must've been insane! How could you do this, you got to get them out now! Now! You hear me? Now! Now, now! Yes sir. Oh gosh. No, you can't be in here, this is no, quiet, don't play! Just get away from that, that's my toys! You don't understand! Call the police! But monsieur, they're your grandchildren. Grandpa, grandpa! Thank you for letting us stay here with you. Everything is so beautiful here and there's so many games to play. Grandpa, how much horsepower does this baby have? That's not... Come dance with us, grandpa! Listen, listen, just quiet down now. You do not know what you're playing with here. These are my toys. You can play with us if you want to, or with our dogs too. Grandpa, you'll love them. Jean Pierre, take them all upstairs and line them up, and you, go wash your face. Okay, you heard the man, let's all go back inside, okay, back inside, come on. Back inside. Back inside! Come with me please, thank you very much. There we go. Don't touch the car, it's a very expensive car, there you go. Expensive car, be careful. I am so, so upset. Please, everybody, you guys, just please line up. Never. No, listen to your grandfather, he wants you to line up. Please give me the ball. Did you hear what I said? Please, hey, please, please. Attention! Thank you, thank you. Jean Pierre, I told you to have those children in line. Alrighty, okay. You're Rebecca, right? No grandpa, I'm Matisia, Rebecca's sister. And I'm Luke, Alexa's brother. I'm Rebecca, Matisia's sister. She's Alexa, Luke's sister. Well then why don't we have you stand next to your sister. And Jean Pierre, you can present them with two red armbands. Red, sir. Excellent. Yes sir. For these two, blue armbands. Blue sir, yes sir! And you must be Juan. And you must be Coco. Yeah. Good. Jean Pierre, for Juan and Coco, a green wristband. Green it is, sir. Well now that we know who's bonded to who, please, these are very, very delicate, expensive armbands. Be careful. But grandpa, what about the tags for the dogs? The dogs? Who belongs to whom for the dogs? Well Alex belongs to me and Rebecca... We can deal with the dogs later. Since we've got everything so well organized now, you can all just go and get ready for dinner. Jean Pierre, would you show them to their room? I will prepare the guest rooms immediately, sir. No, no guest rooms. Just get some mattresses and bring them to the attic. Erm, of course sir. Of course. Children, come with me please, thank you. Chop chop! Let's go, come on, don't be shy. Hey Shawn. Mr. Bloom, you're here. What are you doing? What do you mean what am I doing? I'm thinking. You caused this big mess I have now. Come with me. I don't know. You call this an inheritance? Six children in my house? And three dogs. And three dogs pooping all over my gardens. I'll get you a pooper scooper. Make sure it's cheap You better tell me the whole story. Shawn, all I can tell you is that a lawyer for the daughters called up and said they wanna give you custody of their kids. I thought it was something you'd want me to do, okay? Yeah, you're doing your job right? Yes. But where are they? Where did they go? Your daughters? Yeah, they can't just up and disappear! I have no idea, I have no idea where they are. Don't tell me you're worried about them. About my daughters? Yes yes. No. No. Seems to me you are. No, I'm worried about my house, my cars, and my health. Shawn, having the kids around will be good for your health, very good. Yeah right. Are you mad now? I can't believe we're sleeping in this dusty attic. I know, I mean ew. I cannot live like this. I like it. It's just my size. He can't treat his own grandchildren like this. Guys, I think we all know what this means. This means war. But the question is are you in? War. - War. - War. War! Finally, some peace and quiet. Who could be here at this hour? I'm sorry monsieur, but two paparazzis are asking for you, they insist they'd like to see you, sir. Paparazzi? The pictures. Ah. I completely forgot about them. Send them in. Right away, sir. Go ahead. Send them in. Right away, sir. I know what I can do about this. You're here. Yes we are. And what do you guys actually think you're gonna do with those pictures huh? Blackmail me? No sir, let me introduce myself. I'm Arman from Arman Inc. News Agency. And this is my right hand man Zander. We're the most feared pair of paparazzis of the entire coast. I'm shaking in my boots. Well actually you should be. All right, what do you want for these pictures huh? - Six kilos of candy. - Six kilos of candy. Once a month for a whole year. Oh, and a video game once a month for a year. Make it four. Sir, we'd rather have six. Five. Fine, okay, you have a deal. That's completely unreasonable, but I'll tell you what, so long as you guarantee that you're not gonna change your mind later. Sir, you have our words. We'll be back the first day of each month to collect. And be sure not to call the police, otherwise... What are you talking about? Shut up, don't worry, I heard this in a movie. It's okay. I'm with you guys. I won't call the police. Thank you very much, sir. And here are the contracts. Contracts? Yes, you heard me, contracts. Just read them, they're pretty straightforward, and we'll be back to collect them with our first deliver. Thank you very much, and goodbye Mr. McDoll. Yeah, thank you. Goodbye. Goodbye. Good morning, grandpa. Jesus. Good morning, grandpa. You want some chewing gum? No, no gum. Just had breakfast, put that gum away. Okay. What are you doing? Don't do that in my house, you're gonna scratch my floors all up. Please stop! You're gonna knock something over, Jean Pierre! Jean Pierre! Please stop, just... Could you stop them please? Shall I punish the children and confiscate the hovercrafts, sir? And you can torture them for all I care. Please, this is too much craziness in the house. Just have them sit down and serve breakfast. Please. Join us at the table please. Thank you. Here are your eggs, sir. Monsieur! Monsieur. You trying to give me a heart attack? I apologize sir, but why do you spy on the kids? Spying? I'm not spying on them, I was just watching to make sure they don't destroy my house. Which is obviously something you and Matilda have lost control of. Still, it is very nice to have children playing in our garden, I'll admit that. Well first of all, it's not our garden. It's my garden. And second of all, they're trampling all over my grass. By the way monsieur, shouldn't you play tennis today? Yes, I was thinking about it. But who's gonna look after these little scamps? We could bring them with us so that you might teach them good manners and on court etiquette. All right. All right. All right, I'll take them with me. You just get the Bentley ready. Good choice, sir. And you'll take care of the dogs too. Excellent, sir. Dogs. All right, please, nobody put your feet on the seats! Just don't touch anything! Let's try to be a little quiet okay? Try to be a little quieter. Thank you. What was that? You have a beautiful car. Oh thank you, that's very nice of you. But let's just be calm and, what is that smell? Jean Pierre. Come on, Jean Pierre. That's disgusting. Jean Pierre, I think you should take a bath before we come back, huh? Okay Jean Pierre? Okay. Let's go. Take a bath! Bye. Here we go. Oh, you know what? I forgot my racket. You guys, you stay here, just don't touch anything. You hear me? I'll be right back. What's that? Oh my god! What did you do? Why's it in neutral? Grandpa, grandpa! Grandpa! What have you done! What happened? It's all right grandpa, it's just a broken light. What did you do? Nothing to be worried about. You killed my beautiful toy. It's fine, it's fine. Hey Jean Pierre. Oh, the good notary, how are you sir? Very good. Mr. McDoll is not here, he's on the tennis court, sir. The tennis court? Aren't you supposed to stay with him at all times? Yes, but today he wanted to play tennis with the children and drive his own car, sir. I don't believe it. It's true, sir. Well come over. Have you had a chance to think of what we discussed before? I don't think that Mr. McDoll, I just... Keep working for no money, you keep doing it. Look, you like that he cuts your pay every month right? You get less than when you started. Of course not, no I don't, but just to me, it just doesn't seem right. Doesn't seem right? You think it's right that he hasn't given me a pay in five years because he calls me his friend? So you're gonna live that way? Huh? It's true, it's true when you say it like that. I don't have to offer you I'll give you a little piece of the bone, okay? What would I have to do exactly? Exactly is easy, look, here's a contract all formed. Make him sign three copies. Right over there, and do it in triplicate okay? You gotta get him drunk. Trick him, okay? We have a deal? Of course. A pleasure. My pleasure, sir. Thank you, sir. Guys, this is really boring. Let's tick him off. Yeah, let's liven this place up. Okay, let's start clapping. Grandpa! Grandpa! Grandpa! Grandpa! Hey keep it down, you can't... Ow. Sorry about that. He got shot in the balls. You see, we can't concentrate when you're yelling like that, and it's not fair to the opponent, right? One more. Grandpa! Grandpa! Grandpa! Grandpa! Come on, fight! Fight! What are you doing? Go grandpa! Grandpa come on, hit it! It's out! I won. What out? It was definitely in the court. I seen it from here. No, it's out. It was out. It's out, don't you see? No it's not, it's not. Take me, woo! Water! Listen, when I start dragging the chains, you bang on the boards, you ready? Yes, extremely ready. Grandpa's about to wake up because of the ghosts. Alexa and Rebecca should be ready by now. Absolutely. Dude, grandpa is gonna have the biggest heart attack ever. Guys, shhh. Are you all ready? Yeah. What's going on? What's all that noise? Help us, grandpa! There's a ghost here! They woke us up, we're so scared! This place is so haunted, grandpa please help us. Grandpa, the ghost! A ghost, how scary, help me! Okay, okay, calm down, calm down. Okay, now first of all, there's no such thing as ghosts all right? Then what made... Can we sleep here tonight? Where? In my room? In my bed? I don't think so, no. What's all the commotion, sir? The house is haunted by a ghost. Ghost? Are you serious? I'm scared now, can I sleep here? Oh come on now, please. Look, this is getting crazy. Jean Pierre, you go upstairs and see what's making all this noise okay? Monsieur, me, upstairs, alone? I mean I'm not even armed. What do you need, arms? Go down to the kitchen, get a broom. Maybe some garlic and a cross, I don't know, whatever works. The faster you go, the faster I don't fire you. You got it? Jean Pierre please, you're a hero. Jean Pierre! Jean Pierre! Jean Pierre! Jean Pierre! Jean Pierre! All right, all right, I'll go. It's no big deal. All right, I checked everything. Monsieur, ladies and gentlemen, there is no one upstairs. It's all right. Now please, everyone go back to your rooms and go to sleep. Matilda if you're still scared you go and sleep in Jean Pierre's room. But sir, I have a boyfriend in Paris. I can't. So what? Your boyfriend's in Paris and you're... You know something, you may be right. Just find a room, okay? Find a room for yourself and just go. Everybody to bed! Go! Goodnight. I'm gonna go to sleep. See you in the morning! You heard the monsieur. You heard the monsieur. Let's all go. Goodnight, monsieur. What are you doing? Nothing, nothing. Just pouring the tea for Mr. McDoll. I see, but what are you putting in it? Come here. It's a deal I've made with the notary Bloom, but you have to trust me. What are you talking about? I have to get Mr. McDoll to sign certain documents and then you and I will become rich, we'll share all the money. What's in there? Go. But it's illegal. Poor Mr. McDoll. I know, but for him it's just a drop in the bucket. For us, it's a small fortune. Aren't you tired of being treated like this? Hmm? What did you put inside the drink? Nothing, just something to make him relax, and then when he's relaxed we'll trick him into signing the papers. Jean Pierre, you're getting slower and slower and slower. You expect me to not fire you? I apologize monsieur, but I'm gonna make it up to you with your favorite tea. There you are, right there sir. What are you doing now? Are you gonna eat with me? Is that it? There you go. You mind? Thank you, that's very kind of you, sir. I always wanted to try one of these. I hope you like that tea sir. Monsieur? What are you doing? You think this is funny? You can't get away with this! I'm definitely going to fire you! And you, stop laughing! Take your books and go upstairs and read! Morning, gentlemen. You got the pictures? Yes. They're in the briefcase. Yes, well a briefcase that will self destruct in 10 minutes if we don't complete... What are you talking about? Hey hey hey, let's be cool. We got a deal now. Okay. Jean Pierre. Here it is, monsieur. Now in that bag is the payment we agreed on. Five kilos of candy, one video game, and a signed contract. Amazing, thank you very much. You didn't make any copies did you? Nope. No copies. Trust us, Mr. McDoll, here at Arman Inc. News Agency, we are very honorable people. Well it was a pleasure doing business with you. I'll see you again in a month. Goodbye, Mr. McDoll. Goodbye sir. Come, I have an idea. I don't believe it. Your plan actually worked. Of course it did, Zander. You should totally listen to me more often. My plans do work. And anyway, I'm pretty sure Mr. McDoll got that we could destroy his life with those pictures. Yeah. Oh hey, you two! Oh hi girls, what do you want? We need your technical assistance. It's something vital. Tell us. We have to make a huge prank for our grandfather. Super huge prank. What do you need? Loudspeakers and horrible noises. Horrible. Ladies, I think it's your lucky day 'cause you have just bumped into the FX master. What are you talking about? Just go with the flow. We're not in the Matrix. Let's say we have what you need. When do you need it by? Tonight. Okay, we'll prepare screaming, screeches, loud noises, howling, blood curdling sounds, everything that will give the old man the creeps. Perfect. And our reward? Sweets. And a video game. We know. All right, sure, we have a deal. It's a pleasure doing business with you. You too. Goodbye. Bye. Bye girls. Goodbye girls. Girls, girls! Please, please! Girls, stop it! Stop it! Girls, Coco, no! Girls, don't! Please, please! No, stop it, please stop it! Please! Matisia! Rebecca come on, stop it! Please! I can't do this anymore! I'm firing myself. What did I tell you? What did I tell you? No skateboarding, no ball in the house! Ladies and gentlemen, please! Be a little more respectful, okay? Whoa! Stop! Jean Pierre, make them stop. I'm trying, monsieur. I don't care if you dance, play the guitar and sing, anything you can do to make them stop. Yes, please play something for us, Jean Pierre.

Look, look, look, I think everybody should stay here tonight. Yes! I think if we're all together, there's less chance of ghosts getting to us, all right? How's that? Great idea, sir. Great idea, excellent idea, sir. Can we all stay in here? Sure. So are we doing it? Don't shout, please. Did you notice? He stopped drinking the wine. Yes, I saw that, and I'm thinking. We are running out of time, these children are ruining our plan. I'm really afraid of the ghost. I'm afraid, and worried, that we're not gonna see this money, okay? Jean Pierre! Oh monsieur! What are you two doing, huh? Never mind, you go ahead, you talk. Isn't that what I'm paying you for? We're sorry, sir. All right, forget about it, no buts. What I'd really like to know, what are we going to do about these "ghosts"? I don't even want to think about it. It scares me. I could call a friend of mine, sir, who's a friend of a friend of a ghostbuster, sir. He's quite serious actually. A ghostbuster? Do they exist? Absolutely. Is he reliable? Of course, sir. Cheap? Of course monsieur, otherwise I wouldn't have mentioned it, sir. That's very important to me, thank you, Jean Pierre. Yeah, I know. But you know, we didn't have this problem until our guests arrived. Those six little scamps. Well it might be the ghost likes to scare children. I think you're more afraid of those ghosts than those children are. Well let's just hope that tonight it's a little more quiet. It will. Agreed, sir. We'll see you back in the house. I'm sure we'll find you in the house soon. Okay. Jean Pierre! Jean Pierre! Come on, girls. Did you hear her scream? Come on, take the corners quickly. We need to move fast. Ew, that's disgusting. Come on, move! Come on, Remy. Help me. We need to get out of here now. Let's just go. You have to see, there were thousands of worms, nasty worms! It's horrible. They're over there. On the bed. This bed? Well Matilda, I don't see any worms, I don't know what you're talking about. Hmm? They were everywhere. They were under the sheets, on the pillow. Really? Have you been... The ghost! It was the worm ghost! Everyone stop! He's here, sir. Who? The ghostbuster, sir. Right. Send him in. Did you arrange everything? Yes, of course. Everything is set up in the living room, so let's go in from the back. It's been a few days, they started annoying us in the night. Annoying? It was terrifying, please help us. Be quiet. Right, right. Yes Matilda, breathe. This way, please. We're nearly there. What are you two doing? Us? Nothing. You know, we were just passing by and decided to take a rest, yeah. Can I take a rest too? Yes, right, we're very tired. Whatever you're doing, keep doing it, all right? Can we really? Yeah. You're not angry, grandpa? No, I'm not angry, I wanna have some fun too, can I do this with you? Yeah. Oh, here they come. Let's roll. But how can this device trace the presence of a ghost? Don't worry about that. That's not your problem. I'm sorry to pry, but do you get a lot of work around here? Silence. There is something in this room. What do you see? Disappeared. Oh god. Who's gonna pay for all this? Don't worry about that, there's Mr. McDoll for that. And where is he? He's just there, he's in the... Mr. Mc... Where is he? I don't know, he was there. Oh god! Okay. That's them! Oh my god! We disturbed them. Do something! Good job. Good job. Wow. Whoa. A whole amusement park for ourselves. Come on guys, let's go. Yeah, let's! Grandpa, let's go! Wow, wow. I can't believe he rented an entire amusement park just to play with the kids. I know, that's so sweet of Mr. McDoll. Don't you get it? He's only nice with children, not with us. Well that's something right? No. We have to continue with our plan. Our plan is not working. I'm not able to hurt him. We're not hurting him, we're not doing anything, okay? We'll try again at his birthday party. What party? Mr. McDoll never celebrates his birthday. Well this year he'll celebrate. Trust me. Go! Go, go! Goal! Two points. Come on, up top. I am a bad man! I eat children! I'm bad bad bad! I... Awww. Okay, I don't eat children. Okay? Good. One, two, three! That was actually pretty fun, I gotta say. Guys, guys, come on, over here. Quiet, okay? Okay guys, Jean Pierre just told me that next week is grandpa's birthday. Really? Yeah, but he never celebrates it. That's sad. Surprise party? Yeah. Exactly. We can split up the tasks and arrange everything. Music, dancing, lots of sweets. Done deal. For grandpa. For grandpa! For grandpa! Woo, let's go! It's very good, this champagne. My compliments, Shawn. My friend will be very happy, he made this wine and I wanted you to taste it. Well this is a historic day that you're offering us some. And a little birdie told me you took the kids to a tennis club. How's it being being a grandpa now? I may be a grandfather, but nothing's really changed. I just have a lot more people in my house. Then I heard he rented the Lunar Park, right? We all have to have some fun. Right? Can I expect that you're gonna be throwing a birthday bash this year for yourself? I haven't even thought about that. Let's not everything get out of control. So you have the evening for Trivial Pursuit and Monopoly? No more fashion show for playboy Shawn McDoll? I will never give up on beautiful women. Never. Hey Shawn, we got a big surprise for you. Girls, come on! Oh. That's a unique style. Holy cow. Beautiful eyes. Extraordinary. Good job. I'm glad you like it, same here. Perfect, thank you. Good work, Matisia. Remember, your grandpapa likes his cream to be light as a cloud. Good, good. Good, Coco, excellent, very good. Rebecca, less eating, more mixing. Alexa, please go to the pantry and get the frosting. Boys. Let's relax, okay? Your grip needs to be firm, yet soft. I have an idea. What kind of idea? Watch. A strong caress, good, yes. Jean Pierre. Yes? My cream smells funny. Really? Oh my god. I can't leave you alone with them for two hours? Bravo! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. So is everything ready for tonight? Of course, Shawn. My girls will be here tout de suite. Tout de suite, tres bien. The models are beautiful? Only the best for you. Matilda, could you make sure that the children don't run wild tonight? Sure, I will try. Thank you. What are you waiting for? Tyra's models. And your models? Already inside changing. So do you know what you're gonna say? Yeah, I got it. Girls, girls, please. My grandfather is unfortunately really sick with a terrible disease. And it's very contagious. It's measles. Very very dangerous. So that means that the fashion show will be rescheduled to another night. Bye bye. Let music start please. Here we are. What's happening? Where are the models? I don't know. What does it mean? I do not understand. I think I understand very well. Tell me, where'd you discover the fountain of youth? Awesome, good job guys. Jean Pierre, these are my special cars, this one, this toy was my first. I will suggest that when you massage my toy, you go in a circular motion. Clockwise. Certainly, sir. Otherwise my toys, they suffer, sir. I'm sorry, did you say something? No. No, sir. You watch it now. Sir, I know you don't wanna talk about, but today is your birthday, sir. We're not gonna throw even just a little party for the... Jean Pierre. For the kids. I hate birthday parties. However today I might receive a special present. Really, sir? Might I know what that is? Your dismissal. Oh my god! Oh no, there's mountains of hair and fleas in here, out dogs! Out, out! Come on, come here. Matilda! Could you take care of the dogs? Okay. Jean Pierre. Jean Pierre! Thank you, thank you. We're gonna have to vacuum. Come here. Come here. Come here, Nina. I don't know, it's awfully quiet in the house. You think the children are up to something? I don't know sir, I think they were just waiting for dinner actually. Yeah right. Wait! Wait! Surprise! Happy birthday! Thank you! Thank you! It's party time! Well you decided to do your duty? Yes, of course I'm doing it, he signs those papers tonight. If you didn't help me with this, I would just expunge the deal. We will make it, Mr. Bloom. I have a special potion that should do the trick. Don't worry, he will sign. Holy smokes. I'm gonna celebrate. You sure you want to do this? I don't know. But it's now or never. This is to recognize it. Wouldn't want this getting in the wrong hands. Perfect. All right, let's go. Come on. Happy birthday monsieur, this is for you, sir. Thank you, Jean Pierre. It's a pleasure, sir. Dear grandpa, on behalf of all of us, I wish you a very happy birthday. I just want to tell you that we're all so happy to be with you and hope that you can stand having us for a bit longer. I'm speechless. I can't tell you how happy I am that you all could be here. You've all brought life to my house. And Jean Pierre, thank you for all that you've done. Matilda, you and Jean Pierre, I've been unfair to both of you. And I intend to make it up to you. No more of this selling you short. And tomorrow I think we should meet and talk about what you feel I might owe you. And I will repay you. And more. You deserve it. And my good friend Mr. Bloom. Albert. You and I have some things that I feel I have neglected, and next week we're going to get together and resolve all of those accounts that I've let go, okay? Now what are all these faces for? Come, let us toast. To our happiness and our future. Happy birthday, monsieur! Oh my god. Oh geez, I'm so clumsy. Here, please, take another one. Sir, happy birthday, sir. He doesn't change. Okay, to your health. Mom! Mom! Where have you been? Hi, dad. It's nice to see you, dad. Excuse us that we came without notice, but we knew about the party and we did not want to miss it. And sorry if it was a bit mean leaving our kids with you. Well listen, I really was worried. I thought you disappeared and I didn't know where you'd gone. Well we did disappear, and it was great. We haven't had a holiday in peace for years. Forgive us. Thank to notary Bloom, we arranged this little fiasco. Convinced him that it's a good idea, that you would appreciate to finally get to know our kids. Your grandchildren. I haven't changed. I just love your kids. Thank you. Okay, so we're just gonna play fair, you see. Kinda let the girls play. Please watch out for my plants. Just be careful. The girls are playing good, sir. The girls are very good. Are you ready? Okay, let's go! Oh, good pass. Here we go, nice shot kid. Oh my gosh. Here we go. Oh here we go. Almost, almost. Here we go. One, one, there's one. Whoa, whoa! Oh there he goes. He crushed the plants! Oh no, okay, that's enough, bring it back here. Okay, here we go! Oooh, score! Here we go! Let me just take care of it. Thanks for taking our bags, that's really cool. Of course. Your bags. Okay, bye bye. Thank you. Well let's get this out to the car, shall we? Thank you. It's a shame you guys can't stay. Time to get back to work now. And our husbands. And the kids need to go back to school. Holiday is over, but next time we're gonna stay longer. I promise. I hope so, you know, I have so much extra space here. And I think they like it here. We all know that. We can tell. See you soon, dad. See you soon. Come here. Thank you. Bye, dad. Bye dad. You drive careful now. Say bye to your grandfather. Grandpa, grandpa! Hey. I love you guys. I love you guys. You're terrific. Yeah. You guys are terrific. Grandpa, I'll miss you so much. I'm gonna miss you too. We'll be back, you'll see. You better come back, huh? Sorry for all the pranks. Your pranks? You didn't do any pranks, huh? You're the best grandpa in the world. Thank you. Okay, look, I love you and everything, but next time don't cheat in soccer. Me? Cheat? It wasn't me, it was Jean Pierre. Okay, that makes sense. Okay. Thanks for putting up with us, grandpa. God bless you. Your moms are waiting for you. You be good for them. They'll let you come back, okay? We will. If you're not, they won't let you come back. Well we wouldn't want that would we? Okay. Bye grandpa. Love you so much grandpa. Bye! Tell them drive careful. Time to say bye bye. So long. My home will be empty without you. We'll be back soon, promise. Juan, bye Juan! Luke! Bye Jean Pierre! Bye! Use the force, Luke! What are you two doing? Stop crying. Come on, back to work. Back to work. Monsieur, how about if I prepare the Bentley and we take a ride on the waterfront? No thanks. I don't wanna go anywhere. We could go downtown. No thanks. Cruise on the notary Bloom's boat. No. Monsieur, if you permit me to say, it's been weeks since you've left the house. Can't a man be happy in his own home? Sir, are you feeling okay? Yes. I'm fine. Now no more questions. You just take it easy here, and I'm gonna go inside. And I wanna be left alone. Hey Shawn. Oh gee. What are you doing here? It's been months, Shawn. Yeah. You don't force me to your shows anymore. Oh I'm sorry. I don't do the, I haven't done them for a long time. I just don't feel like doing them. Everybody's a little worried about you. People at the tennis club, they're worried about your absence. It's just, I've been busy. That contractor you introduce me to, I fixed up the club and been working on the rooms in the house just in case. "Just in case" just lousy excuses. Grandpa, you're sad because you miss the grandkids. Everybody knows that's why you're down. All right, you're right. I miss them. You're right. I gotta get my life back. They got a life, they got their family, they got the school. The dogs. You know what? When was the last time you took your boat out? Oh my goodness. Huh? Out of the harbor? You gotta take me out on a cruise. I hope you have insurance. I do. Good. Okay, buddy? All right. Okay. Thanks for coming by. My pleasure. Come on, you get with it, get some strength back. I'm fine. I'm fine, don't worry about me. Don't worry about me. Okay. Be careful of the ants, they're coming by here. Yeah, the red ants. I see two of them. What are you looking at? Can't a man have any privacy in his own home? I'm sorry, sir. Ah, it's you. I thought it was Mr. McDoll. What's up? I'm worried about him. He'll be fine. He seems better after seeing Bloom. We must do something. Like what? We've tried everything. That's not true. Not everything. Did you have something specific in mind? Maybe. Maybe, well if it's tiresome then please count me out because I am already tired today. Stop it. We owe him. Oh really? Do we? Yes! You, me, and Mr. Bloom, we almost betrayed him just for stinkin' money. Well when you put it that way. Come on, let's call Mr. Bloom. And all the girls are here now. Just go in, have a drink, take a look around. All right, one drink. Of course. Here we go. Excellent sir, after you. Shawn, sit down. What are you doing here? You guys got something going on? There's a surprise for you, monsieur. Oh yeah? We're here to discuss another inheritance. Oh no, you can't do that joke twice. Don't be so sure. Oh! Grandpa! Grandpa! Hello, hello! Oh it's so good to see you. So good to see you. Hey, do your parents know where you are? What, are they on vacation? No grandpa, our parents, we love them, but we adore you, so we asked them if we could stay here with you. That's so great. I built rooms for you. Yeah, but the real question is how long can we stay with you grandpa? How long do you wanna stay? Really? Forever? Forever. Forever! Drinks for everybody huh?
