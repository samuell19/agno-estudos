[ sighs ] Patty Wilson, please tell us what is your favorite hobby? I like going to school - And playing the violin. - No. No. Patty Wilson, please tell us what is your favorite hobby? [ sighs ] I like helping the homeless. Right. Great, great, great. OK, if anybody ever asks you anything, you always answer with charity, OK? Homeless, pets, old people, doesn't matter. This is your pageant, honey. You're going to take this one I know it.

Our first contestant is Taylor Rollins. [ applauding loudly ] ANNOUNCER: Taylor is 11 years old, and says her favorite animal is a kitten. And her favorite color is pink. [ clapping politely ] Taylor, dear, what has been the most proud moment of your life? Well, I'd have to say that I was most proud of myself when I volunteered in a children's hospital over the summer. I felt very lucky to be able to help kids who weren't as fortunate as I am. Well, that is definitely something to be proud of! Thank you, Taylor. [ applauding loudly and whistling ] That girl only stopped peeing the bed - like three months ago. - Leanne! - And now... - [ shushing ] our next contestant, Ms. Patty Wilson [ cheering ] My baby! [ cheering and screaming ] My baby! Patty's from Austin. Patty's favorite color is... gray? OK, Patty, your question is what's the biggest challenge facing young girls today? Hmm. Society's pressure on girls to look perfect. This emphasis on appearance is linked to three most common mental health problems that we have today, low self-esteem, eating disorders, and depression. OK, thank you, Patty. Well, that's definitely something to be proud of. All right, then, now, our next contestant, What the heck was that? And why would you say that at pageant? Well, it is true, and I thought the right thing to do was to tell the truth. Honey, the truth is relative. The plain and simple truth is really plain, and it's never simple, so remember that, OK? Well, I thought you did a great job. I'm very proud of you, sweetheart. Thanks, Dad. Me, too. You were the best one out there. You had it won, but you took your eye off the prize. You gotta keep your eye on the prize, baby. The prize is in the eye of the beholder. That is the spirit! [ engine rumbling ] There we go. [ sighing ] If only we had more money, you'd be training with somebody from Dare to Dance like Taylor's doing. God, if you'd only got that promotion, Don. Oh, sorry. Stan Buford got it. He's dating the boss's daughter, so unless you want me to start doing that... [ laughing ] Don't worry, Daddy. You'll get the next one. [ scoffs ] Don't hold your breath, honey. You know what they say, the world would be a much better place if it were run by women, and I think you could do it. You're so talented. You remind me of me when I was little. Only you're better. The only way to make it in this business, honey, is to be a triple threat. Look at Miley. [ scoffs ] Great role model, Mom. Yeah, she's a triple threat. She can sing, dance, and take of all her clothes. Well, she's got a great body. She works very hard for that. Why not show it off? I wish I had done it. I wish I had done it when I was young. I would have showed it all off, now, in hindsight. Doesn't Miley just go around licking everything or... Well, sometimes you have to sacrifice, Don. Sometimes you have to lick things. Carrie Clark took the stand today in the federal trial of Jakob Todd Mitchum. He's the man who abducted her and held her captive nearly 10 years ago. After only five hours of deliberation, the jury found Mitchum guilty of kidnapping and sex crimes against a minor. Carrie arrived at the courthouse with her parents, Lou and Carolyn Clark, who spoke to reporters after the verdict. We're just so happy that this whole nightmare is over and that Carrie is back home with us again. It's been such a life-changing ordeal, and I think writing this book, Carry Me Home: The Carrie Clark Story, will be very cathartic for me. All right, geez, what a media whore. I think she was just feeling a sense of relief from finally having some good news, babe. [ muttering ] Whatever. A look into the ongoing struggle to keep Austin weird. [ static noises ] My-my ear piece's not working. I can't hear anything. [ clearing throat ] All right, Patty, it's time for bed. Mom, I've almost got this piece down. - Come on. - You see there's this part - that keeps tripping me up. - I know, I know. But if I only practice that section, - the piece will be perfect. - Time for bed. I could kill your father for giving you this thing. Come on, time for bed. Jump in. You know if you're going to be up late practicing, you should be practicing your new choreography for your jazz solo. Mrs. Patterson says I'm really good. Says I can even do this for the talent competition. Oh, honey, that's not gonna happen. I love the way you play. I'm so proud of you, but trust me, nobody's ever won America's Got Talent playing a fiddle. It's not a fiddle. It's a violin. OK, a violin. I mean, maybe you get to be a contestant, but you don't get to win. Dancing is fun. - Mom. - It's sassy. People love it. You still mad? No. I'm over it now. You looked amazing, and before you gave everyone a coronary, you were doing real good. Lay down. Get to bed, come on. [ groaning ] Mom, are you sure I can't go to Rhonda's birthday party? Rollerskating? Oh, absolutely not, baby. What if you got a nasty bruise or you get hurt? Mom, please. It's so embarrassing. I'm always left out of the fun. Baby, I don't want you to throw away your future on a dumb, little party. Look, I know it stinks, but I wish my Momma would have pushed me harder. Oh, you have jazz and ballet tomorrow. I'm going to drop you off before I go to work. [ sighing ] I love you. - See you in the morning. - Goodnight, Mom. Goodnight, baby. This one declined, too. What? You know what, I'll just write a check. Actually we don't accept checks from you anymore. It's $25 after they bounce. Come on, Kandy, cut me some slack. I really wish I could, Leanne, but if we don't get Patty's tuition in full, she can't start her new classes next week. And we all love Patty, so I really hope you can figure something out. All right, you know what, I wanted the airline points, but whatever, just put it on this. That's a coffee card. Just take it. [ laughing ] Great. You know I'm late for work, so I will grab that when I bring Patty for class. Thank you! Bye, Donna. Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit! Fuck! Where have you been? I got here as soon as I could I had to deal with Patty's choreography, - Leanne. - Hi. I swear if you're even 10 seconds late again, you're out. Jose, my car wouldn't start, and then it got all smokey, - and I couldn't see anything. - Not interested. - [ scoffs ] - Nice try. Leanne, your next client is here. She's been waiting. Let me get her. Please tell me this isn't happening. This is our fabulous makeup artist, Leanne. [ gasps ] Leanne Milling! Oh, my God! Shut up! Crystal Clemens? I know! I don't think I've seen you since our Avon days. Time just flies right past, right? It sure does, but you look just as good as ever. Oh, shut up, really? Are you kidding me, you're still a beauty queen. Oh, my beauty queen days are over. I'm a Momma now. Doing the Momma thing. Get out! How many kids do you have? Just one. She's my little princess. Her name is Patricia, but I call her Patty. She's picking up right where I left off. Oh, that is just precious. I bet she's gonna be a winner just like you. Well, let's get you in the makeup chair. No kids for me yet. Not with our hectic schedule. My husband's an old man. How old is he? No, "oil" man. - Oh, oil. Wow. - Yeah. I mean, but he's old, too, so, whatever. Every other day, we got some kinda party or event we gotta go to. Oh, we're also building our dream house up in Aspen right now, so, yeah. Anyway, I'm sure once all that settles down, we'll probably, you know, pop out a couple. Well, what are we going to do today? Oh, well, we have this huge black-tie charity event to go to for children in Africa or somewhere, I don't know, anyway, the governor's gonna be there. I just want to look really good in case the cameras are rolling. Anyway, I just keep going on and on about me, tell me about you. What is going on? How have you been? Did you marry that hot boyfriend of yours? I swear I always thought I was going to see you on Days of Our Lives or something. - [ laughing ] Stop it. - I did. What are you talking about Billy? Oh, please, honey, I outgrew all of that when Don came along. He just walked in and swept me off my feet. I mean his business was just blowing up, so we moved to Austin. Yeah, you know, he's a super successful computer guy. Well, then good for you for doing these little makeup jobs and helping chip in. Well, you know what, I don't even have to do this, - hm-mm. - but I love it, it's a passion. So, I needed a little creative outlet. I come in here whenever I want. You just work whenever? Yeah, my own schedule, my own life. For me, I mean, when you're a mom, I mean, I know you don't know yet, but sometimes when you are a mom, you just need a little me time. Understood. Whatever you can get. - Whatever works for you. - [ laughs ] You know what? I'm actually just talking way too much, and you should be relaxing, so why don't you lay back, and as soon as you finish reading that magazine, you'll be gorgeous. OK. Oh, this poor girl. I swear I have seen her on so many interviews. And her parents have done the rounds, too. They're always so positive. I don't think I could do it. I know I couldn't do it. - [ shouting ] - [ thuds heavily ] Oh, my God! Leanne, are you OK? Oh, I can't move. JOSE: Call the ambulance. - Oh, it hurts so bad. - Here, honey, look I'm sorry, but I really gotta get somebody to finish my face. [ whispers ] Sorry. What, what? Relax, calm down. The medics are on their way. Damn it. Oh, shit. You know it's bad enough I fall on my ass in front of everybody in the salon, but in front of Crystal Clemens. What do you care what that dummy thinks? Because, Don, I worked with her at Avon. She was like this little, annoying dog that was always nipping at my heels wanting everything that I had. Boy, how the tides have turned. Coming in there talking about her rich husband, and her giant mansions, and, "oh, I gotta look good in case my cameras are rolling." [ mocking ] I bet she didn't even have a charity thing to go to, I bet she just wanted to come in there and rub her fabulous life in my face. I didn't know you thought your life was so lousy. Oh, Don, come on, you know what I meant. I just always thought that I was going to be, you know, something more. Well, why don't you just, you know, put the focus a little less on Patty and a little bit more on you, do something that makes you happy. Why don't you take a dance class again? You love that salsa dancing or whatever, right? With what money, Don? I don't even know how we're going to pay for Patty's classes now that I can't work. God, she's gonna be so disappointed. Well, you know, maybe we can scale back on Patty's activities. I think it might be good for her, possibly. You know what, Donny, I'm real tired. I don't feel so good. I'm just going to go to sleep. - OK. - Hey. Rub my feet 'til I fall asleep. - OK. - Pretty please. And I'll pay you back tomorrow night. All right. Ow, Jesus. What? What the hell time is it? Oh, shit. Oh, please be OK. Jesus, Leanne, how could you be so stupid? Everything's going to be just fine. I'm sure I'm going to get there, and she'll be still at school, just laughing and hanging out and talking with the teachers. Oh, please be here. Excuse me, sir. Have you seen a little girl? - She's got blonde hair. - What? - Her name's Patty Wilson. - No. - About 10 years old. - They all gone. I mean, school's over. Oh, my God. Don, it's Leanne, where the hell are you? [ honking ] Come on, move it! Patty! Yes, I'll still hold. Patty. What are you doing? My God. - Where were you? - Where were you? I was looking all over town for her. Well, I waited over an hour. I called you a bunch of times, and you didn't answer, so I called Daddy. Oh, my God, baby, I'm so sorry. My back was hurting so bad, and I took some pills. And then I must have just gotten knocked out. Told ya. Why didn't you answer your cell phone? The battery was dead. Oh, I was so scared. I don't know what I would ever do if I lost you. Well, you'd be on the news threatening the kidnappers, I'm sure. That's right. Nobody hurts my baby. Ugh! [ typing ] Surprise. Oh, hi, Billy. Leanne. I know I haven't aged a day, right. [ laughing ] Look at you, you look good. It's so good to see you 15185, there we go. Hey, man, there's some chick out here to see you. All right. Billy? Really? What the hell do you want? Well, that's a fine hello after all this time. Oh, well, hello, Leanne. It's so great to see you again. OK, I get it. You're right. I should have called first. But I wanted to surprise you. Why the hell would you want to do that after what you did? Listen, Billy. I'm sorry about the way things ended for us, but I've changed a lot, and I feel like I owe you an explanation. That's nice. But to be honest, I don't give a shit anymore. OK. This was a mistake. Forget I was even here. No, wait. Since you took the trouble to come out here, just say what you want to say. [drill whirring] You think maybe there's somewhere more private where we could go? [ hydraulics whirring ] I thought I'd never hear from you again after you left me high and dry for that pussy-ass husband of yours. I still remember sitting there at Christmas dinner with my folks, waiting for you to show up, but you never did. Billy. I'm so sorry. If I could take it all back, I would. How are they? My folks? They died a few years back. Tornado. Jesus. God, I'm so sorry. Oh, Billy. So was it worth it? Living like a queen in the lap of luxury? [ scoffs ] Yeah, right. Not even close. When I first started dating him, he was working for his daddy making a fat allowance. We were living like rock stars, but it was a government probe, so no company, no inheritance. You know, I feel like I got swindled. - Don manipulated me. - Wait! Wait! Please. Do not say his name to me. OK. He, who will remain nameless, did fully take advantage of me and my naivety. Aw! Now he's just a regular working stiff, huh? That serves you right. Billy. Leaving you was the dumbest thing I ever done. You gotta know I regretted it all these years, and I never ever stopped loving you. Then why are you just coming to see me now? Because. I had a daughter to raise. I was trapped, You know, but you know I can't... I can't deny my feelings for you anymore. I wanted to leave him for the longest time, but I can't. I can't afford to support me and my baby. Well, she's not a baby anymore. She's 11 now. You would love her. Oh, I had a dream the other night that it was the three of us, and we went to Six Flags Six Flags? And we were season-pass holders, and we got on all the rides, and it was so much fun. [ sighing wistfully ] I really want that dream to be a reality, Billy. The only happy times in my life were my dreams of you. Oh, baby, that is so sweet. Oh, pinch me because this better not be no damn dream. How 'bout a kiss instead? I can't believe this is happening. You know what? I loved you then, and even after what you did, I guess I still want you. You make me the happiest girl in the whole world. Oh, I can't wait to start our life together. Then why don't we? Because I don't have no money to support me and Patty. I can't afford a fancy divorce lawyer. I'm still paying off a bunch of fucking equipment - and tools and-- - OK. I have a plan. Because I was praying that you would take me back. I think it's our only chance. - We kinda gotta get creative. - OK. We need to kidnap my daughter. Come again. Not for real. It'll just be for show. We will be in control of everything. She will be totally safe. What the hell are you talking about? We just need to keep her missing for maybe a month, right? And then the media storm will start. And I'll be like, oh, where's Patty Wilson and such? Then I'll go on TV crying over my baby, and then a month later, she's found. Look at Carrie Clark. She's been on TV show, every major newspaper, magazine cover, everything. But here's where the real money starts. Her and her parents got a book deal and a TV movie. They're making millions, Billy. They are cashing in. What do you think? I think you're out of your damned mind. I mean I haven't worked out the details, but I think it could really work, and I do think it's the only way that we can really be together. All right. All right, if we do this, we do it my way. I'm not putting my neck on the line without a real plan, and we're going to need some help. We're gonna need JT. Who's JT? JT: I don't wanna be a part of no kidnappin', Billy. I'm nervous about it, man. I can't get in trouble again! I mean what am I supposed to do with some kid? I don't know nothing about changing no diapers or none of that stuff. She's like 10 or 11 or something, man, she don't need no diapers. Billy, Billy, Billy, man, you my best friend and all, JT, quit worrying, man! Just stop! It's all cool. We got the perfect plan. And like you said, I'm your best friend. Don't I always have your back? Didn't I protect your ass in prison? You owe me, man. [ sighing deeply ] So this the girl you used to always talk about when we was locked up? Yeah, the one and the same. Shit! She's here. - Woo! - [ startled scream ] - Hey beautiful! - Jesus. Billy, you gave me a heart attack. Been missing you, baby. My God, I've been dying to see you. Yeah, well, me too. We can't be seen together. Well, I think we're pretty safe here. - [ laughing ] - No kidding. I felt like I was driving to the ends of the earth. JT, come out, meet Leanne! Hey, Leanne, this is my buddy, JT. This is Leanne. The love of my life. - Hello. - Ma'am. So this is your place? Nobody else lives here or stays here? Yes, ma'am, it's just me here. It's not much, but I think your daughter would be comfortable. Hell, yeah, she will. He's got a satellite receiver, a DVD player, even an X-Box. It's gonna be like summer camp. Billy says you're a good man, JT. But this is my baby. I mean, she is my life. I'm doing this for her, but it ain't gonna be easy, so I need to make sure that she's gonna be happy and safe. If so much of a hair on her head is harmed, I will see to it that the son of a bitch who hurts her is skinned alive and fed to the wolves. Whoa, baby, baby, I told you. JT's a teddy bear. He couldn't hurt a fly. Am I clear? - Yes, of course, Ma'am. Then if anything inappropriate were to happen, I will come here myself and cut it off. Ma'am, I'm no sicko pervert. I just want to help you and your daughter get away from that monster you're married to. I don't take kindly to men beatin' on no women and children. I had to tell him, baby. [ sighs ] It's OK. It's all right. [ sobbing quietly ] I really-- I really wish there was another way. He'll never let me go. And I ain't got the money to support us. I understand, ma'am. Sometimes a mother's gotta do what a mother's gotta do. - We'll take care of it though. - Yeah, we'll get it done, baby. Oh, thank you. Never understood dog people. They're not your kids. Nancy, I need you to go cover the annual Portlandia festival. Ugh, seriously, Alan? Hey, look, you don't remain number four in Austin by not paying homage to the barbecue. How long are you going to keep me in the dog house with these ridiculous stories? It was a minor mistake. You accused a city official of bestiality. On the air. It's not my fault that he got rid of the evidence before Animal Control intervened. You're just lucky he settled for a retraction and didn't sue the station, and that you still have a job. Yeah, well, you didn't have to kiss his butt and go to his little dinner party. It was a great party. I hope you didn't try the lamb. Oh... [ sighing ] that's disgusting. Oh, God. Al, you know I'm your best reporter. No, you're not. Who is? Steve Breckenridge!

BILLY: Trying to get the damn ladder up - the stupid fucking thing. - Stop it. [ shushing ] Are you crazy? It's a one-story house. Why are you on a ladder? I'm letting you two idiots in the back door, remember? Wait, what? Don't call me an idiot. I thought the plan was to go in through the kid's window? It's only supposed to look like that. You don't actually do it. What if someone sees you? And what are you wearing? Costumes? Jesus, come on. Wait, put the ladder down. Make up your mind, woman. Amateur hour with you two. Do you know how hard that thing is - to strap on top of a Chevelle? - Well, why'd you bring it? Get inside. [ shushing ] [ Billy groaning ] You are so sexy when you're mad. Come here. Are you drunk? Drunk might be overstating it a little bit, huh? - JT? - He had a few beers. [ imitating an elephant trumpeting ] Are you out of your mind? Give me that. Don't worry, Leanne. I drove over here, and I'm sober. You haven't had anything to drink? No, no, I've been too nervous. Well, at least one of you is using your head. Well, I had to take the edge off, baby, but I'm cool. Let's do this. Where's the little kid? Be real gentle with her, OK? And make sure that it's warm in there because she's always cold, and I gave you information in case there's an emergency. Don't worry, Leanne. I got the instructions just like you told us. I took care of everything. She's gonna be fine, right, Billy? Motherfucker. Steel my woman, huh? Take a whiff of that, you piece of shit, mother-- What in God's name are you doing? I was just having a little fun with shitface here. Are you-- That is disgusting. Are you crazy? You'll wake him up. Wake him up? What do you mean? You said they'd be out 'til morning. Well, I don't know. I've never drugged anybody before. Oh, God, I have been missing you, baby. And you're not even giving me a proper hug. Billy. Really? JT, a little privacy? - OK. - Come on. Let's do it right here on the bed, huh, right next to this shithead. - [ bed creaking ] - Knock it off! Are you nuts! God, we are seriously wasting time, you guys. Now get out of here. Come on. There's enough time to fool around later. - All right. - Oh, man. Don! Don! Patty's gone! Don, come in here! Patty's missing! Don, I can't find her anywhere. Don! - [ breathing heavily ] - What? Where is she? - Oh, no. - Patty! Patty! Where is she? Oh, Don. I don't know. - OK, OK, OK. - She's not here. Call 911! [ metallic clanking ] [ screaming ] [ Patty screaming loudly ] Hey, hey, hey. [ shushing ] Look, look... Nobody's going to hurt you, OK. You can scream all you want. No one's going to hear you. Relax, relax. Don't worry, breathe, breathe. - Forget this, man. - I'm not gonna hurt you. He's not gonna hurt you, OK? Nobody's gonna hurt you. I know it seems crazy. [ Patty screaming hysterically ] - It's OK, relax. - [ laughing ] Come here. Come here. [ patty groaning ] [ laughing ] What the hell did you do to her? Chloroform, man. I had a feeling we'd need that. Damn, what a brat. Billy, you can't keep her unconscious a whole month. - She's just scared is all. - She's just a pain in the ass is what she is. Obviously her father's daughter. Poor girl, she's scared she's been kidnapped by two crazy men in masks. Well, you know what? Maybe it'll be good for the kid, toughen her up. Life isn't always going to be this perfect, little bullshit suburban fairy tale like she's been living. She's gonna have to learn. Life ain't fucking fair! It doesn't always turn out like you thought. Yeah, yeah, I got it. There's no finger prints. So what time was it, ma'am, that you tucked Patty into bed? About 9:00, we'd just had a big dinner, and everybody was sort of in a food coma [ mumbling ] Now my baby... I can't believe she's missing. And where were you at this time, sir? Oh. I was, uh, I had just eaten. I was getting ready for bed. I don't remember falling asleep. We had had turkey with all the trimmings, you know. [ sniffing ] And the Tryptophan, I think, It like knocks you out, you know, it's like Thanksgiving when everybody just falls asleep. Patty loves her turkey. Do either of you have any enemies that you know of? Enemies? Any recent disputes? Uh, I don't know, you know? I feel like-- I feel like we're pretty well-liked. - Yeah. - I can be socially awkward. But that's just more being quiet. I'm not a jerk. I feel like maybe people don't like Don but they don't say it? But I still don't feel like they would do this to us. I agree. Yeah. What kind of goddamned psycho does something like this? Oh, Don. Why didn't you just wake up? - You could have done something. - I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. What kind of pictures do you think we should put out of Patty? Like a pageanty one or... Could I put out several? We pay lots of money for the best photographers. We have great pictures of her. We go to Walmart and really get it done. Oh, this is just great. Glad we can see the people in the background because I don't really want to see the interview subjects. Nancy, I need you to cover a kidnapping that just came in. Yeah, right, a kidnapping. Do you want the story or not? - Are you serious? - Yeah. What are the details? OK, we don't know much at this point, an 11-year-old girl taken from her home in the middle of the night. Investigators are at the house now. Well, is Matt ready? Because I'm only using his team from now on. Yeah, they're waiting on you. Don't blow this one! Does this work? If they're standing at the front porch, can you get us all in if we need to and in focus? MATT: Yeah, roger that, I got it. You tired of working with the B team? What good is it to get an exclusive if it's not in focus. No national network's going to pick that up. It's just a waste. Speaking of which, if you want to get noticed by the big boys, you need to sex it up a little. Unbutton a couple of buttons, show some cleavage, maybe some leg. Matt, I'm about to interview the parents of a missing little girl. Sick. MATT: It couldn't hurt. Don't you think we should get closer? You know? Oh, see. Is this what you wanted? Yeah, that looks good. Hold on. They look huge on camera. I know. There's nothing to worry about here, folks. Sheriff Williams, he's that good. The best. Did you talk to that squirrelly guy next door, the one with the thick glasses? Oh, yeah. We interviewed all the neighbors, sir. He was twitching. - Mm-hmm. - Who's the biological father? - He's the biological father. - I need coffee right now. Yes, sir, right away. I'm sorry. Excuse me, I didn't get much sleep last night after the call about your daughter, and it's been a really long day. Well, so sorry for the inconvenience, but what is going on? Do you have anything to tell us all? That's why it's important that we put out a press statement right now. The earlier we get a photo of her out there, the better the chances are that we'll find her before something really bad... Oh, my God! Thank you! - Just like you like it, Chief. - Oh, I love coffee. I'm an addict. [ slurping ] There's a ton of press out there. They're all waiting to hear your statement. There's going to be cameras rolling. Reporters are going to be screaming at you asking you all kinds of questions. You have to be ready. The attention can be a bit overwhelming. In fact, if you're not up to it, I'd be happy to take the reins on this. I've had a lot of experience in front of the camera, and I'm a bit of a student of the theater, so. Larson, here, he's seen me in action. Oh, excellent actor. I did Noises Off six months ago. The local critic said he would put me up against, Uh, no, that won't be necessary. Thank you. We're fully prepared to do anything that we need to do to get our baby back. Yeah. - [ sighing ] - OK. All right. REPORTER 1: Mrs. Wilson, Mrs. Wilson! This is Don and Leanne Wilson. They'd like to make a public statement. This is our darling 11-year-old daughter, Patty Wilson. She's the light of our lives. She was kidnapped from this home in the middle of the night. I don't know how or why anyone could be so evil. But we just want our baby back. She's such a sweet and amazing girl. That's why we like to call her our Peppermint Patty. [ sobbing ] Oh, we pray with all of our hearts that whoever has her, wherever she is that they treat her with dignity and respect because that's what she deserves. Please have mercy and let our baby go. She's good. LEANNE: [ through TV ] Please let her come home. Wait, that's my mom. Oh, you scared the hell out of me. Thank you all for being here. We'll update you when there is more information. That's all for now. You shouldn't be watching this. Why'd you do this to me? We're not going to hurt you. How do I know that? You don't know, you just gotta trust me. You're not going to get anything for me. My parents don't even have any money. We didn't abduct you for money. Then why am I here? I'm not supposed to talk about with you. Then why are you doing this? I can't talk to you about it. You should just stop asking questions. Fine. I'll remember that when they throw away the key. You're gonna be fine, OK? That's all I can tell you. - I know that woman. - Seriously? Yep. I went to high school with her. She's what they call nowadays a mean girl. That woman made my life miserable. [ laughing ] Uh oh, were you like the annoying overachiever, and she was the hot, popular girl? No, I wasn't-- You know what, shut up. - That's so rude. - OK, OK. How did she make your life a living hell? Well, you're slightly on the right track, I mean, she was our school's queen bee, right, I mean, gorgeous, popular, cheerleader, Homecoming Queen, Prom Queen, any other queen we had. So are you like the disgruntled one, always a bridesmaid never a bride? No, I mean I was an outstanding student, obviously. Yeah, I was head of our yearbook committee and newspaper editor. I was Vice President of the Senior class. That was great. I had to get votes for that. So a giant dork. I hate you. [ car door slamming ] You know I'm just messing with you? Finish your story. [ sighs ] She made fun of me in front of everyone. She called me nerdy Nancy. [ stifling laughter ] And that caught on like wildfire, of course. It's all just because in ninth-grade English, I slightly questioned her book report that she was reading to the class. From then on, she made it her life's mission to ruin mine. She's just such an evil bitch. You do recall that this poor woman is looking for her missing child. Yeah, and I feel terrible for them, and I'm going to be all over this story, and do everything I can. Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of. Just spread the word on the streets. It's horrible. I can't believe this happened in our community. I mean, Oh, my God, I have four kids. We live here, we go to school here... Excuse me, have you seen this girl? She's been missing for a few days. We've got nothing right now, and we're digging hard. These guys are professionals. They're good. They're hot. They know what they're doing. - [ sizzling ] - Hoo-wee! I'm sure glad you chose pancakes because I do make a mean flapjack. [ humming ] See how you're feeling after this. Dig in. How can I eat these with my hands tied? OK. All right I'm gonna untie you, but don't try nothing. OK? You can't get out of here no ways. This place is secure like Fort Knox, and you do not want to be wandering around out here in this wilderness. We're in the middle of nowhere. Wild animals and such out there. You remember what happened to little red riding hood. What? OK, me neither. Oh, you about to be happy now. Probably be the best flapjacks you ever had. Let me do a little of that for you. [ humming ] Whoops. Wait, you're not trying to drug me again, are you? What do you mean? I'm eating it with you. Look, Bill-- Er, Bo only did that because you were screaming and freaking out. He was trying to help you. He was trying to calm you down. Gee, how nice of him. Just take one bite of the flapjack. You'll feel loads better. Go ahead. Mmm! - These are really good! - See, I told you. You can trust me. Well, isn't this nice? A little breakfast for dinner, huh? I made a ton. Go and grab a plate. No, I'm good. Just came to check on our little princess. I see you stopped shrieking. [ laughing ] Whoo, she's a firecracker, huh? Probably going to be just like her Momma, - little heartbreaker. - Wait, you know my Mom? Do I know your Momma? I used to-- [ clearing throat ] I mean, of course, I know of your Momma. We did do our proper research and what not. I'm not freaking amateurs. Hey, why don't you have some flapjacks with us? - Come on, Bo. - Bo? Um... Uh... Uh, no, Luke. I can't stay. I gotta get back to work. - You got everything you need? - Yeah. All right, you know where the Chloroform is, right? You tie her back up, you understand me. As soon as we eat. Bye, princess. [ dialing ] [ mobile ringing ] - Hello? - Hey. Oh, God, I miss you so much, baby, I can't concentrate. I gotta see you. Are you crazy? You shouldn't be calling me right now. No, it's OK. I'm calling from a pay phone like you said. I need to see you. What part of no communication unless absolutely necessary do you not understand? This is really stupid. Well, how the hell long do we gotta go without seeing each other, huh? I keep seeing you on the news. You're looking so hot. It's killing me. I told you a month, and it's only been a week, so don't call me unless it's an emergency. Are you not missing me at all? Oh, baby, of course, I miss you. I miss you like crazy. I'm just, you know, a little on edge because I don't wanna screw things up. Oh, Billy, we're gonna be so happy when this is all over. I know we are, baby. I'm sorry. I'm a fucking idiot. - I gotta get going, but, uh... - Wait. I love you. How is the little bunny rabbit? - It's fine. - Happy to hear that. - She's doing good. - Who are you talking to? - I said I-- - Police? Yeah. DON: What'd they say? Any good news? No. God damn it! Nearly a week and nothing. Amazing. [ engines revving ] Uh-oh. - [ clicking furiously ] - Uh-oh. Earnhardt Jr.'s coming up. In a second, Jimmie Giles is gonna eat my dust, come on. [ chuckles ] Come on, come on. Woo-hoo! I told you I'd win this time. You learn fast, young Skywalker. Huh? Oh, nevermind, it was before your time. How long am I gonna be here? [ sighing ] I don't know. Not long. Sorry, kid. Yeah, well... I do miss my parents and everything, but it's actually kind of nice to have a break from my life. Really? Yeah, it's the most downtime I've ever had. [ chuckles ] Downtime? You're a kid. What do you know about downtime? Well, let's see. So I go to school at seven o'clock, and by the time I come out at two, I have either dance class, show rehearsal, um, acting classes or singing lessons, and then most days, I have two classes back to back. So that means I come home around seven-ish. Then it's dinner, homework, and my Mom hounding me to practice with her until I'm ready to pass out. Oh, and let's not forget all of the never ending competitions and pageants I have the pleasure of being forced to do. Oh. Your mom's one of those moms. She means well, I guess. When do you see your friends? Well, friends? No, friends aren't in the schedule. Yeah, I don't have many friends either. It's nice to play this game with somebody, you know, other than the damn computer. Yeah, of course, but why don't you have any friends? [ sighs ] I guess I'm just uncomfortable around people. How 'bout your family? Hi, boys and girls. Hey, man. [ sighing heavily ] How's it going here at, uh, Shangri-La? We're just playing the X-Box, and she beat me. Oh, and can you pick up a copy of Star Wars? Can you believe she's never seen it? PATRICIA: Well, it's like a million years old. JT: It doesn't matter. It's a classic. No excuse. Bo. No, I ain't getting you no friggin' Star Wars. [ Leanne on TV ] Don and I are cooperating fully. I completely support the police investigating all possibilities. I need to be honest for a minute, Claire. I'm not who people think I am. I'm acting brave, but I'm really just a coward. And I miss my baby so much. And I know I've been acting strong and-- This has been very hard on you and Don, I--I'm sure. Can somebody get her some Kleenex? [ somber orchestral music ] Look at her. That's my baby. She's an amazing singer, and a dancer and... she should be a model. We don't want her to grow up too fast. We try to keep her home, you know. [ sniffling ] She's just like a little Meryl Streep. She has so much talent. [ sobbing ] I'm so sorry. - It's going to be OK. - Thank you. CLAIRE: It's going to be OK. I didn't expect that to happen. Sorry. CLAIRE: If anybody knows anything, sees anything, please contact your local police, we want to help Leanne and Don bring Patty home. - [ patting knees excitedly ] - Thank you for listening. [ haunting orchestral music ] NEWSREADER: It's been seven days now that 11-year-old Patty Wilson was abducted from her Hancock neighborhood home, but the community has not given up hope for her safe return as dozens of people came to Quail Creek Park today to show their love and support for her and her family. This next song's for Patty Wilson. We miss you and hope you come home soon. NEWSREADER: Gathered around local musicians, the Tiara Girls, it was an emotional night as members of the community gathered to light candles and pray for Patty Wilson. So far, the FBI and local authorities have not reported any leads, however, the search has intensified as dozens of local residents have scoured the area [ suspenseful electronic music ] - Hey! - [ screams ] - Still obsessing? - Don't do that. What's the latest? Absolutely nothing. There's no finger prints, no DNA, no leads. But she's certainly making the rounds. Yeah, 'cause she's trying to find her kid. No, the police are trying to find her kid. There's nothing new to report to the media. Yeah, but maybe she's, you know, hoping the kidnappers will see her on TV, feel bad, and let her kid go. Oh, that's a great strategy. That always works. OK, I see your point. I don't know. This story's starting to pick up national steam though because Patty's one of those child pageant stars. Oh, yeah. Every station is flashing an old pageant glamor shot of the poor girl when she was, like, seven years old. How's that helping? It's disgusting. [ snorts ] The media, the press, they are disgusting. [ sighs ] I mean, if only they were as honorable and conscientious as you are, then the world would be a better place. - Thank you, I think. - Mm-hmm. Or F you. Thank you or F you. I never know. [ sighs ] Something tells me Leanne's not going to be complaining. [ chuckles ] God knows she was an attention whore in high school. OK, uh, have fun obsessing, and I'll see you later. - Order lunch. - Sure what do you want? - Tacos, spicy. - No. No. - I want 'em spicy. - No. Handle it. - No. - Handle it. I'm getting you soup. No! [ drumming and clapping ] OK now you try to do the... - [ clapping rhythmically ] - you know, the clap, - and I'll do... - [ beats drum ] OK. - One, two - Three, four. [ clapping and drumming clumsily ] Whoa! Ooh, ouch. Oh, gosh, I can't believe girls do this. What? Girls rock at this. Come on, I'll show you something else. This is called the Sleeper Hold, OK. Turn around like this. You feel this forearm right there? - Mm-hmm. - OK, feel my head. - Mm-hmm. - Now watch this. [ snoring ] [ giggling ] Here, now you try it, come on. - OK. - OK. - Like that? - Like that, that's right. - And like this. - Yeah, OK. There you go, now. That's good. [ both groaning ] How come you're not sleeping? It'd take about five of you at your strength to put my big ass to sleep, - so you need some strength. - Not really. Some actual... [ groaning ] It's cool. We're friends now, right? Yeah, we're friends now. [ suspenseful electronic music ] [ sobbing ] This is such a violation. That's our beautiful home that we made together. [ indistinct conversation ] DON: Jammies, pink jammies. Princess jammies. They were yellow, Don. He never pays attention to her. What about Frank and all the neighbors coming over, and bringing us all that stuff? That was really nice. [ mobile ringing ] Who is it? I don't know. I don't recognize the number. Probably just another news outlet. Who might have information for us, babe. Just--Just get it. [ clears throat ] Hello? Well, you two are looking pretty fucking cozy. Oh, no thank you. - Now's not a good time. - Oh, no. [ scoffs ] You're sitting next to that fucker, aren't you? You put that limp-dick bastard on. Put him on! Hey, fucker, hey fucker! I don't want any. You need to meet me tomorrow at the rendezvous point at noon, and you better be there. [ inhales ] [ sighing ] Telemarketers. Unbelievable. [ grunts ] ANNOUNCER: Amber is slapping fives with with her fans, getting the crowd... How do you know all this wrestling? [ sighs ] Um, I was kind of a loner when I was younger, so I used to watch a lot of wrestling on TV, probably too much. That must be nice, like, sitting around, chilling, watch TV. Oh, if I did that, my mom would have a cow. Hmm. You're mom may bug you, but I'm sure she's just doing what she thinks is best. I can't even remember my mom. She took off when I was two. You lucky to have so many people in your life that care about you. Is that your keyboard? Uh-huh Oh. Well, do you play it? [ sighs ] Not lately, but yeah. [ plays keys clumsily ] Cool, like, are you any good? Geez. I started when I was about your age. -Really? -My Grandmama taught me. [ plays keys clumsily ] -Wait. -Yeah, I got a Grandmama. OK, everybody has a grandmama. Since nobody was ever home at my place, I'd go over there as much as I could. She didn't have much, but she had this old piano that she played all the time. She wanted me to learn, and I didn't want no parts of it, so she bribed me with, like, chocolate and Ding Dongs and bologna sandwiches, and she gave me lessons. At some point, I started to actually liking it. And then I got pretty good. It came to the point where I would go over there just to jump on that piano. Well, you know I play the violin? The violin? You play that, too? You see it's not one of my mother-approved activities. My Dad let's me play though. He thinks it's pretty awesome. Well, it is. I love it. Maybe we can play together some day. Maybe we will. [ haunting alternative rock music ] [ clears throat and sighs ] You're late. Didn't think you were gonna show. I had to at least go in and buy something, so I don't look so damned suspicious. This is super risky, you know. Everybody in town knows who I am now. Give me a hug, and look like you're consoling me, like you just bumped into me. [ chuckles ] [ breathing heavily ] Oh, you reek like booze. Put on something new. That's the most damn action I've gotten from you since this whole thing started. What do you expect? We talked about this. [ sighs ] I'm just not so sure about all this anymore. What? Oh, baby, how could you say that? I sure as shit don't like seeing you and your scumbag husband all over each other on every damned TV station. And I'm about fucking done with being hung up on it. Well, I don't want to take any stupid chances right now, OK? You should be happy. I'm getting a lot of publicity. - [ scoffs ] - It's exactly like we planned. No, exactly like you planned. So, what, you're just gonna keep soaking up all the publicity while I wait around doing your dirty work like a-- Like a little bitch? You are doing the most important part. You're taking care of my little girl. You're doing it for us, don't forget. I'm going crazy, baby. I need to be with you. I--I need you. Hey! OK. Remember when we planned to meet after the Homecoming game at that old abandoned barn? Oh, yeah. You remember how long we had to wait to be together? We had to wait through classes, and we had to wait through the football game, and we had to wait through the ceremony. Hmm... King and Queen. - King and Queen. - [ chuckles ] Remember how good it actually felt after all that anticipation when we finally got to be together? It was the most mind-blowing night of our lives. How could I forget? Think of it like that. This is all just foreplay. OK, I promise you. I will make it worth your while. - Hmm. - DON: Hey! Psst. Hey! How is she? She's a little pain in the ass. Hey, don't you talk about my little girl like that. You better be good to her, Billy. As long as you're good to me. Nice to see you. Leanne Milling and Billy Fontaine, that can't be good. [ typing ] Oh. Life has not been good to you, sir. [ surreal piano music ] You know what, sweetie, that's actually my cup, and this is my seat, but you're gonna sit right over there. -Oh, I'm so sorry. -That's all right. That's OK, go on. Yep. I didn't do it. Would you look at right there? I feel like there's something right there going on. Hang on one second. I don't want you to be nervous or anything, OK? Thank you. Thank you, Jenny. [ exhales ] Oh, you're so skinny. JENNY: OK, great. Got it, thank you. PRODUCER: Hey, Jenny, uh, we're back in three, two... OK, great. You ready? [ clearing throat ] PRODUCER: And we're back. Hi, welcome back to Jenny. Our next guest is someone that has been in my heart, I know, and I think she has been in the hearts of everyone in this nation. [ indistinct conversation on TV ] [ door opens ] Oh, finally. Oh, I'm starving. Yeah, it was a crazy line. At Good and Fast? Hmm, I had to make a stop. Where'd you go? Hmm... What's behind your back? What do you mean? Oh, this? No! Now don't get too excited. It's used and pretty beat up, but it was the best I could do. I can't believe you did this. Here you go. - [ plucks string ] - I'm sorry it's not new. I love it. Thank you. What you waiting on? Play something. No. What do you mean no? Do you know where I had to go to find that? Well, not unless you play, too. [ groaning ] No, I'm real rusty. Well, listen, you kidnapped me, so I think you owe me one. [ lively violin and piano music ] [ chuckles ] Wow! Hey, Bo, man, we're playing some music. - You gotta hear us, man. - It's really cool. It goes like this. [ lively violin and piano music ] What the fuck is this, JT? - JT? Who is JT? - No, fuck that shit! The fuck's it even matter anymore? You took your fucking mask off! I mean, why don't you just dial 911 for her while you're at it? It's cool, man. She--She's cool. We're friends now. Friends? Are you shitting me? The little brat's playing you, man. And what about me, huh? What the fuck's going to stop her from ratting me out? Huh? And what if something slips and she reveals it about you because you were stupid enough to give her your mug shot on a silver fucking platter. Who do you think she's going to throw under the bus then? Shut up! Don't you back talk me, little girl. - Who? - He's right. We are friends, and I would never get him in trouble. You look more and more like your Daddy every time I see you. Wait, you know my Dad? Yeah, I know the limp-dick loser, - and I'll tell you what-- - He's the best Dad ever! Not some scumbag kidnapper like you! JT: Oh, my God, I'm so sorry. Are you OK? I'm OK. I'm OK. The fuck! I'm going to tell you this one time, Billy. If you ever touch that child again, I'm going to beat you to a fucking pulp. The fucker's mouthing off. She's just a kid! And you got something against her, I know it. So you just leave your damn hands off of her. This wasn't part of the plan. Her mother find out, she'll kill you. [ groans ] Great. My mother? Oh, God. I'm so sorry. There you go. We're all fucked now! Where you going? Billy! I can not believe they cut the best part out of our Dateline segment. How could they not show all Patty's trophies and what an amazing girl she is? I can't believe it's been this long, and they still have nothing. What are the police doing on this? Besides sleepwalking through the investigation. You know what we need? We need Oprah. Nobody gets more viewers than Oprah. Are you serious? Yeah, what? Who fucking cares about Oprah? You know our daughter has been gone for almost a month, and we're no closer to finding her then we were a month ago. Don, calm down, OK? We are trying to help the police the best way we can. All the exposure is good for her. Oh, all the exposure, yeah. The exposure's been great. All the exposure's done is make us into a fucking spectacle. What do you want to do, Don, huh? We're not the FBI. We can't just go around investigating. This is the only thing that we can do. Honey, the people who committed this crime have no soul, no humanity. If the cops find them, they better fucking fry them. Because if they don't, I'm going to find them and fucking tear their fucking hearts out, and then rip them limb from limb with my fucking bare hands! [ breathing heavily ] Come here. I'm sorry, baby. No, I'm sorry. [ sobbing quietly ] [ suspenseful orchestral music ] That lying bitch. - Hello, handsome. - Cut the shit, Leanne. You really thought you were just going to play me for a fool, and then toss me aside? Use me and then live happily ever after with your stupid-ass husband? You're still the same selfish bitch you always were, but, woman, you are out of your mind if you think I'm going to let you fuck me over twice. So you know what, this time, it ain't going down that way. I'm thinking of paying Sheriff Williams a visit. Sit him down and let him know that little Patty Wilson was kidnapped by her own goddamned mother! You got nothing to say about that? Oh, you think you're gonna turn me in and walk away unscathed, huh? Well, then you must be the same dipshit you always were. I'll tell you this. If I'm going down, you better believe you're going right down with me. Better yet, I got another idea. Why don't I just let you take the fall for the whole thing? Yeah, I think that works better. As a matter of fact, who's going to possibly believe an ex-con over little old me, and I'm going to put on such a show, you won't believe it. For the cops and for the jury. You better get ready to say hi to your old prison buddies. [ laughing ] You know none of this really matters anyway because that little brat of yours, she knows you're involved. - What? - [ door beeping ] Yeah, that's what I came here to tell you. - What? - Yup, the gig is up sweetheart. She'll probably throw the book at all of us. - Billy-- - Or you know what, come to think of it, I got a better idea. Maybe I'll just dispose of the evidence, and then there won't be proof of anything. - Yeah, I like that much better. - As God as my witness, you better not lay a hand on that girl. This is all on you, Leanne. It's your fucking fault. You're gonna find out what it's like to have your fucking heart ripped out! Billy! Wait, hey! [ suspenseful electronic music ] Hi, JT, it's Leanne. Billy just came to see me, and he's losing his mind. I don't know if none of us are safe. He's coming your way. You gotta just tie him up or something. Protect Patty whatever you do. Where is she? [ breathing heavily ] She's asleep. Well, that is very-- very literal, JT, thank you. He came in on the war path, all right. Talking crazy, not making much sense. He mad as heck at you. Threatened to expose us all just to hurt you. He don't even care if he get himself in trouble or me, for that matter. I had to Chloroform his ass. Mom? Oh, baby! [ sobbing ] I missed you so much. Oh, it feels so good to hold you. What happened to your face? What happened to her face? I'm so sorry, Leanne. Billy got to her last night. He was acting up. He got to her before I could stop him. I took him down though. JT, would you please take Patty outside for a minute? I just want to talk to Billy. Come on, Patty. [ grunts ] What the fuck? [ groaning ] You are a son of a bitch. I would've never in a million years dreamed you could become such a monster. You did this to me. I was doing fucking fine until you came along with all your bullshit and lies! How dare you hit my baby? That little bitch of yours, you mean? She's probably going to be a cock-tease just like her Momma. [ groaning ] Motherfucker! God! [ groans ] You are seriously going to regret this. I promise you that. - Oh, really? - Yeah. You know JT may be a little freaked out right now, but he's my boy, and as soon as he calms down, he'll untie me. I wouldn't be making any threats to me if I were you, Billy. You were fucking with me the whole time, weren't you? I loved you. - Billy, come on. - No, I did. You were never going to leave him, were you? [ sighing ] Fuck you. - Fuck you! - No, fuck you! You think I would leave Don for you? I may have got with him for the wrong reasons, but he is a much better man than you. [ scoffs ] You're nothing but a mean, old drunk, a loser, a two-bit criminal who likes to hit little girls! You know, you're going down for this, you bitch! No, you are. I don't give a shit if I have to rot in a cell for the rest of my life as long as you're doing the same. I mean, you've looked in the mirror lately, Leanne? Don't kid yourself, sweetheart. You're not looking too hot these days. A little old if you ask me. - Excuse me? - Yeah, that's right. I think it'd be about time to trade you in on a newer model anyway. [ groans ] Now let's both be honest. We both know I had your dumb ass wrapped around my little finger, but I guess some things never change. - [ laughs ] - [ groans ] Don't think you're gonna get over on me, you are crazy. I'll tell your brat you said goodbye. [ groans ] [ grunts ] Holy crap. [ breathing heavily ] [ muffled groaning ] [ sobbing ] [ muffled groans ] Jesus, Billy. Why'd you make me do that? [ sniffing ] [ gagging and coughing ] [ camera shutter clicking ] Baby. I'm gonna explain everything, OK. Listen, baby, I just-- JT: Oh, my God! What the hell happened to Billy? He left me no choice, JT. It was self- defense. I swear to God. He was--he--he-- [ Leanne muttering nervously and indistinctly ] He loved you. And you just was lying to him. You're husband's not abusive at all, is he? Mom, why would you do this? Baby, this is going to set us up for life. I hated that you were here and that you were scared, but I knew when the public took one look at your face, they would see that you're a star, like you're destined to be. Mom, you never hear me. This is so horrible, even for you. Wait, dad doesn't know you did this, does he? No, baby, Daddy's not strong enough to go through with a plan like this, and I know you don't see it now, but I did this for our family. This--this is going to be a distant memory, and the rest of your life is going to be like a dream come true, baby. Stop saying that. It's just not true. You did this all for yourself. Oh, honey. [sighs] You just have no idea what it's like to look back on your life and see regrets. Nothing is worse than wondering what your life could've been like if you would have done things differently or taken bigger risks, and I don't want that for you. So I saw an opportunity this time, and I took it. But things just got out of control. Sometimes, you just go too far, and you just can't find your way back. But now we are just going to keep pressing forward. [ sighs ] Were you cheating on Dad with that creep? God, no, honey. Of course not. Of course not. And don't you worry about those two. I'm gonna take care of them. Mom, you better leave JT alone. He's my friend, and he's taking good care of me. Honey, I'm glad you liked him, but that man could cause a lot of trouble for us, OK? You don't really know him. No, you don't know him! I'm telling you this, mother, if anything happens to JT, I will tell the whole world what you've done. Excuse me? Now you listen to me, little lady. No, you listen. I'm not going to let my friend get hurt because of your crazy scheming. I'm so serious. You wouldn't do that to your own mother. Yeah, what, you're gonna get rid of me, too, now? OK. OK. [ sighs ] OK. JT? JT, can we talk to you for a minute, please? Come on out here. Everything OK out here? Of course. I wanted to say thank you for taking such good care of my little girl, for keeping her safe, and I also wanted to say that I'm very sorry for what happened to Billy. Please know that what I did, I did for all of our sakes. And I'm also very sorry for what I'm about to do right now. Huh? Thank you all for being here. I stand here upon this, uh, stage, if you will, I'm reminded of a quote by Will Shakespeare, "Cowards die many times before their deaths. The valiant never taste of death, but once." [ camera shutter clicks ] The alleged kidnapper, this coward of a man, is deceased. He was identified as 40-year-old William Fontaine. The crime seems to be that of a personal vendetta. This investigation is ongoing, so I can't tell you any more than the facts at this moment. I can tell you, however, there does appear to be a hero in this story, the valiant, Mr. Jebediah Thompson. [ clapping and whistling ] Mr. Thompson was acquainted with Mr. Fontaine, who knew that Mr. Thompson owned a secluded cabin in a remote wooded area. This is where he took Patty Wilson, and where they remained until Mr. Thompson made an unexpected visit to that cabin and discovered them. At this point, he realized that she was a missing child, made an attempt to rescue her, a fight ensued, leading to his death. JT is a rare breed. We'd like to thank him for his courage and for rescuing Patty Wilson. [ applause ] Uh, at this moment, Mrs. Wilson would like to make a statement. - [ applause ] - [ clears throat ] Hello. [ laughs nervously ] [ chuckling ] [ Leanne ] Well, I just wanna say we are over the moon to have our precious daughter back, and I want to sincerely thank the FBI, Sheriff Williams, and the entire department, as well as this community, for your compassion and your generosity and your assistance during this horrific ordeal. Don and I are so proud of what a strong and resilient girl Patty is, and we're so happy that she's going to be able to show the world her talents. But I really want to take a moment to give thanks to JT. Because of this brave man, we have our baby back. He'll always be our hero, and we can never thank him enough. [ applause ] One last thing. One last thing, thank you. One last thing. I want to thank the Lord. Thank you, for bringing back our little girl... safe and sound, and I want to thankall of you. God bless you. [ applause ] [ text message alert sounds ] [ text message alert sounds ] Well, if it isn't Leanne Milling. Oh, I don't have time for an interview, now, honey. I'm meeting someone. Yeah, I know, you're late. Have a seat. Join me. How dare you send me that ridiculous text. Oh. Hello, uh, can I get an iced tea unsweetened, two lemons? I'll have the same, but sweet, very sweet. You're Leanne Wilson. My Momma says you're an inspiration. That is so kind. Please tell your Momma, thank you for her love and support and prayers. I'll get those teas. Sweet. You're just loving this, aren't you? The attention, the spotlight, the fame? You haven't changed one bit. What are you suggesting? That is disgusting. Hey, drop the act, Leanne, please. I know the truth. Yes, of course, you do. Everybody does. They saw it on the press conference on television today. Yeah, I saw it as well, and I'd have to say if I didn't know you were lying through your teeth, I'd have believed every word. What? Are you trying to slander me? [ chuckles ] Slander? No, no, no, no. The word is expose. OK, what is this? You still have a little bug up your ass about high school? Oh, no, this is so much more than that. I followed you to that cabin in the middle of nowhere. Imagine my surprise to see all the key players there. You, Billy, JT, [ gasps ] and your missing child. Wow. You look worried. Are you OK? [ Nancy chuckles ] You have no idea how good it feels after all these years to just knock that snotty look off your face. Oh, and don't get any crazy ideas either because if anything happens to me, I've made arrangements for the story to be released. Oh. I'm afraid you're going down, and I'm so happy to be the one to do it. Fuck. Wait! Shh! Please. You want money for the iced tea? No, just sit down, please. I want to explain this time. The truth, for real. I know you'll understand. OK, Billy and I did reconnect. Don and I were going through a really hard time, and I just talked to Billy, and he made me feel so good about myself, but then when I realized I couldn't really go through with it, Billy went ballistic. He started threatening me, and then he kidnapped Patty, and told me that if I didn't leave Don, he would keep her or maybe do worse, and so I figured I couldn't hurt Don any more than I already had, and I would just play along with Billy until maybe he would just let Patty go. Somehow I figured I could convince him. I thought you were going to tell me the truth. That doesn't add up, and you didn't have to kill Billy. I-- JT did. He had to. He was threatening Patty. Listen, as far as I'm concerned, all signs point to you being the killer, and regardless, you withheld information in an abduction of your own child. Well, he was blackmailing me. What was I supposed to do? He said if I called the cops, he would kill himself and Patty. He was crazy. He was not the Billy we knew from high school. [ chuckles ] I don't know,Leanne. That's just it. You don't know. And how can you ruin my entire family based on something that you're really not sure about? Not to mention, most people might think that you're just trying to put yourself in the limelight by using my tragedy. - Oh, that's ridiculous. - Yeah, I know it is. It is. Yeah. I know, but you, you of all people, know the media and how they can spin things. And a lot of people are going to wonder why you didn't go to the police first. I was about to break the news. I just had to finish my investigation and gather my evidence before I presented it to the authorities. I think it's far from a slam dunk for you. I think you might become the laughing stock of the media. I have an idea. [ exhales ] I have an idea that might put both of us on top. [ chuckling ] [ clearing throat ] [ purring ] Oh, you know what, will you take a look at this for me? Thank you. Did I mess up my face? I think you look great. Think we look great. I think we're ready. Thank you. PRODUCER: All right, we're on in five, - TV ASSISTANT: And cue music. - PRODUCER: Four, three,... [ program intro music plays ] Good evening, I'm Nancy Nelson.
