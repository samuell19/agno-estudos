- The air-con is out? - For the last 10 minutes. - Sir! - Forget the service sheet. Bring me the print-out for the thorax from last night. Hi. Then we'll take a look at the blood. The thorax has been flat since 12.45 a.m. We're at the same point with the blood. Fine. Has Sommiere left? No, he's working on a face in theatre 4. - Grangier... - Coffee. - Yes, Sir. Grangier! Easy on the bottle! There's some of A and 6 standard bottled left. You're kidding, aren't you!? What are they doing in Paris? They didn't find a plane. It left by road. We will have to buy it from Switzerland at 300 francs a pint. Like last year. Okay, let's get to work. Grangier, what was that thorax? A police motorcyclist. - Fairly tight. - Yes Sir. - OK, let's go! - Done. Europe-1. It's 5am, here is the news. In the past year, road accidents have killed nearly 72,000 people in Europe, of which 13,000 were in France, the European Transport Ministry reports. However, despite these figures, the experts are not overly pessimistic as it is less than the previous year. But for the Minister of the Interior a figure of 13,000 road deaths is not acceptable. Here, Juliette! - Aren't you coming with us? - No darling... I'm not coming. I'm still half asleep. How are you? Heck, I got 3 hours sleep. We're a mess! So, have you made up your mind? I don't want to stay here all on my own. There's no one here in this dump! The car... he won't forgive you. He'll keep it. Do you think you can drive that bomb? It can't be any more stupid than its owner. That bag of yours weighs at least 20 kilos. They're your clothes. I'm not a storage facility. Aren't you going to be pushing it? Montpellier on July 31... you'll make it in 12 hours, easy. After 8 days sitting on the phone, it'll be a change. Well, we have to get moving. Scram then! Careful! Don't mess up the other side! There's enough space. No, back off, for God's sake! OK, I'm coming. Here, it sure is hot. Where are we going to put more cars? Piled high up, Sir! You some sort of architect? Caron, phone! Coming! Hold the line. Hello. Caron Repairs. Yes. Yes. Is it tow-able? What model? Yes. OK. Let's see the time.... it's 6.34 on this Saturday 31st of July... It's a beautiful day. Yesterday was St Juliet's Day, but we celebrate it today. Guingand Garage Closed till September 1 - Is Fernand in? - No. Mr Guingand? No. What do you want? My car of course! A Fiat 130 6-cylinder Well...? How am I going to get it out? It's not ready yet. What do you mean, it's not ready? It's been here for three days. I don't know... it wasn't my job. I was told not to let her out before Tuesday... It's without a master brake-cylinder. Listen… I've got 400 klicks to drive... all the family waiting for me... and a booking that cancels if I'm not there before 6pm. I need that car pronto, my friend. Understand? I can't let a car go out without brakes. But who's talking about brakes? I'd asked for a grease, oil change and new plugs. That's all done. So it's just a matter of… Don't move.... That's it... Gently. Gently... Try to... We'll put him in the car. - Where's my father? - Don't worry, sweetie. I want to see my father! My name is Marc Jaeger. My father, Jean-Claude... I want to see him. He'll come. Stay calm, sweetie. He keeps asking for his father. He must be delirious... there's only his mother. We examined the luggage... There was a 3rd person. Where did he go? An ambulance must have taken him. Are you friends? Not at all, we just pulled the kid out. Excuse me, ladies. So, young man? Sir, I have to find my dad. Yes, my boy. Come with me. We'll go home peacefully. Come on. I want to see my father! I'd like a Coke. Stop! He's crazy! Who'll help me load? Come on! Give us a hand! No, it'll help you lose a bit of fat. Tactful of you. I can get you a chick or two No. But if it's any help... I brought a rope in case of those side pains. A rope? To do a bit of exercising of course. They're laughing at you! - No reply! - I'm dumbfounded! Move your mitts. Let's get moving. Hey, Edouard... Since I have a big car... ...what if beat you to the villa... and get to grab the best room? Bad idea! You'd be missing the village again. We'll have to come and get you in the forest with a can of petrol. Like that other time! I think there are cassettes in there. Do you know how to make that thing work? I don't like music. Are you going far like this? I absolutely have to be in Nice before dinner. Before dinner?! In Nice. Otherwise, my in-laws wouldn't forgive me. They're people who are... extremely strict. But… ...how come you're travelling by hitchhiking? You don't look like one of those… Already it's hell! You have to pay every 5 min! Identity control. Your licence and registration. Thank you. I don't know where it is. - Behind the steering wheel? - Think so? Yes, there it is. Can't say you've brought me luck. I'll be leaving you. I'm not keeping you. Do you want my photo? No, it's in front of me. - I gather you're Juliette Delors? - Normally. - Who is Florence Rouvier? - Who? - Florence Rouvier. You don't know who's the owner of this car? No… Actually, yes. I thought it belonged to... not a women, but a man. But the car belongs to a lady. How do you know? I believe the registration card. Unless it's fake. - And your passenger? - He was a hitchhiker. Are you insured for that? I don't know about that. Here. - Have a good trip, ma'am. - Miss. - What happened to this one? - He missed a curve. Again? Fine... Hose it down and salvage anything worthwhile. OK. They do it on purpose! This is the last time. It's you who's doing it on purpose, you can't help yourself! We've been waiting here a quarter of an hour. In five minutes… - What? - We'll go. We mustn't miss out on the booking. No way we're gonna look for them! As if! Dad, the engine is losing oil. Don't worry, it's nothing. Get in the car! Come on! Shut the little thingummy. So there you are! Well, you haven't seen the shortcut, boyo? It was clear on the map, though. Haven't we wasted enough time? Hey, don't yell at us! We were good enough to come for you. We didn't have to come! "We didn't have to”… phooey! Bunch of idiots. Leave me alone! Is this 60 59 12? Yes? Who's calling? I'd like to speak with Mr Philippe Rouvier. He's not here just at the moment. I won't be able to call him back. Not now. Can you give him a message? Of course. Go ahead. Could you tell him that... that Juliette Delors…. Delors. D-E-L-O-R-S... will be in… in about 4 hours, at the petrol station at Montelimar, on the motorway? So, at 2pm. Yes. Wait... there's a bar... he knows it. I'll be there. I won't budge. You understand? Yes, of course. Not until he arrives. You'll give him that message? You can count on me. Are you…. are you Philippe's sister? No. Alright… Thank you. Goodbye. You're not leaving without having a drink with us? If I were you… I'd say to myself... "Why say no to Roger?" Roger's my name. What's yours? - Juliette. - That's not true! I don't believe you. Too bad. Can you believe it? Her name's Juliette. - You're kidding! - Yes, Juliette! Join me for a shower? That won't get you any further. I don't like her attitude. She doesn't appreciate that I'm lacking a woman. She even claimed that I only operated only men because of that. What we're missing, eh? Did you notice? That woman died after the sutures. I thought we'd made it. Too much alcohol. At 2 g, it coagulates more. Should tell them not to drink before coming here. It cost us 4 litres of blood for bugger-all. - Tired? - A bit yes. Me too. See you later, Sir. Yes? We've got this morning's photos. Put them on the table. - Grangier! - Yes, Sir? Who was she? No idea. Shall I inquire? Don't bother. What's coming? A cranium and a ruptured liver. Together or separate? Separate. - Keep the liver for me. - Very well, Sir. Go get Edouard and Raymond over there. - Crazy, Albert! - It's touching! - Dinner! You never seen a guy parking? Is the restaurant going downhill as well? - Leave him alone! - You're a bit of a pain in the arse. He has to be noticed! He's so nasty! Gerard, what are you doing? I'm wedging the wheel, Dad. Don't bother! Come on! Come on, let's have a drink. Hurry up, or there'll be nothing left to eat. Come on, Gerard! We'll have a light wine. A Beaujolais. A local wine? A bottle of the local! A carafe! - Water for the kids! - No, a Coke! You're drinking Coke all day long! God bless you! I don't give alms. A large cream and a double squeezed orange. I'll only bother you for a moment. Get out! Back off, Stitches. You're embarrassing the lady. The lady is nervous. Even worried, I'd say. Ignore him. He's annoying, but not dangerous. Did you call him Stitches? Yeah, that's what he's called. He was burned in his car not far from here. He had new skin sewn onto his chest. - Is he always here? - Yes, he shows off his chest. We don't kick him out. He never hurt anyone. He helps out and we give him bones. Don't need a dog. Okay, more ice cream. The fridge is on the blink! It's time to move on now from this stopover... Christian is almost at Montelimar. We'll meet up at the Montelimar rest area. We're just parking now. It's a beautiful day. Maybe just a little too warm. I'm getting out of the car with my mike. Hello, Sir, Miss... - Hello. - Having a nice time? Yeah, good. I didn't ask you your name. - Giroux. - Mr Giroux. My daughter, Juliette, is opening some champagne. I'm letting our listeners know that. Offer us some champagne. I'll have something for you, too. Dad is taking a photo! We're posing. Off you go...! This is real radio for you. Tell me, how have you kept the champagne cold? It's just 'sparkling'... and we have an ice box. - There are lots of ice-cubes.. - Ice cubes, great! You're already tanned... where are coming from? - We were in Sanary, it's near… - Near Ciotat. I know the area well. Mr Giroux, come here, please. Come here. You have to tell me... why you called your daughter Juliette. We're listening. Well, we didn't know what to call her, and... my name is Jules. - So? - Well… So we called her Juliette. Quite simple! That's logical. It's fucked up now. That's what I said. Leave me alone! Madam? - Your car's gone? - Yeah. - It was me who took it. - What? That car belongs to me. But who are you? You spoke to me on the phone. Otherwise, I wouldn't be here. I'm Florence Rouvier. - No! - Yes. What allows you to take that car? It belongs to me. Can you prove it? Do you want to see my papers? A piece of information will interest you. What are you talking about? I'm trying to say that I'm Mrs Philippe Rouvier. Does that explain it for you? Get over it, it happens. I'd like my keys. The keys? Yes, they're no longer of any use to you. But if you were doing this... behind Philippe's back...? I have nothing to prove. But that car belongs to me. Show me your papers. It makes you 38 years old Yes, is that a crime? He never told me about you. He never told me about you. Well... my keys. Take them! I should slap you. Of course... You should... But you won't! Go ahead, hit me! But where is that moron? He chickened out of coming, right? Is he waiting for you at home? Shut up! - It's my turn. - We'll drink that! You've drunk too much, Albert. Stop for a bit. Don't deprive yourself... I brought it from home. - There's quite a way to go. - Admit you don't want to pay. - The bill! - Who does the sharing? We'll see to that later... Let's just taste this delight. You drink it like it was beer! It's poison, it chokes you... Why you making car noises, when this is only a cart! At least it's paid for! Albert... the boys... - What? - We didn't get any radishes. Hey! Raymond, you've eaten all the butter. - We saw you. - It's true. The kids are doing stupid things. This is on me! My father's had me drive. It's not hard. Shit! Shit! Shit! -Albert! Gerard! So? So? What's happening? You saw your sister? Yes. - Is someone coming for you? - No. I'll have to sort it out for myself. It's not serious. There'd be lots of folks who'd take you down to Montpellier. I have to go back to Paris. You should to take the train. It's a long way to Paris. - Is the station far? - Don't worry... - Tonio will take you there. - You have to catch it. Who's Tonio? The taxi driver. But he has a job today. Let's try... phone Tonio. - If he's not here? - We'll see. - Being served? - Yes. Hitching a ride, with her looks... ...the lady wouldn't be waiting long. No one will take me with all my luggage. Don't worry, it'll work out. You're fine with us here, aren't you? Paul, give the lady a Pernod. A Pernod? No. In the state I'm in... One... now and again, eh?! I'm feeling calmer. Paul, one for me, too. If necessary, I have a small comfortable room with a large double bed. OPERATING THEATRE 6 What is it? Sir... what was that about? - It's blood. - For what? Oh dear! Listen, Sir! It's blood... Doing an operation takes blood! It's not possible. Why are you looking at me like that? We can leave if you want. - It's OK… - If you prefer... Yeah yeah! Stop walking like that, Albert. Why does he look at me? Do I have the plague? Calm down. He should have known, anyway. He was the one who noticed the car was leaking oil. You can go... it's over. I told you... the operation lasted three and a quarter hours. No point in annoying you. I missed my zinc. - Where were you going? - Ibiza. No showers there. 4th floor, Sir. Yes? How much? Still? Give him an IV. Yes. One of the six. We'll try... I'm on my way. Well… is… ...my son…. Is my son… ...dead? No, he's alive. But he's not ready to walk. What did you do to him, doctor? I managed to save his legs... ...but he'll no longer have use of them. Couldn't that be avoided? Yes. Yes, it could have been avoided. What will become of him? Like everyone else... you'll find him a small car... Preferably with brakes. I'm sorry, madam. You can see your son tomorrow morning at 11. Follow me... there are formalities. And the mechanic! What am I going to tell the mechanic? Albert... come along. Turn around! Yes! There you go! Come on! Come on! It's nice! Come on!! Yes! Look! There! It'll get hot now... The ground will give off heat. I'm going to be soaked. By 7 o'clock, it 'll be unbearable. It's lovely! You'll be dry in a couple of minutes. Milo, it's not the Botanical Gardens...! There are customers waiting! Bad news... Tonio's cab broke down at Tarascon. Oh well. Too bad. I'll hitchhike. That's all you can do. - There you are young lady. - Thank you. Thanks for everything. I must owe you something? No. On the house. Good luck. Safe journey! Miss! Miss! Wait! Don't go there! Miss! Come back! Nothing broken as far as I can see. It could have been worse. But Robert's very angry. That's my dog. What's the matter with you? So what do we do? I ask you for damages or do we sort things out nicely? Damages. You almost killed me! That's true. Who would have missed you? Bastard! Already with the abuse! Yet you're pretty much intact, aren't you? I wish you'd drop dead! Too late. There's something I'd like to ask you. Hey! When do you parade as a notary with a Legion of Honour and all? Fuck off! Alright. How much do you want? 500, 800? What was in the suitcase? I could go up to 1000. There was that red ribbon. What name? I don't want your money! Leave me alone... do you understand French?! Just get the fuck out of my sight! Change your tone or I'll have you charged! Why were you crossing the motorway carrying a bag full of notary's clothes? They're not a notary's! Whose? Listen, maybe we should pick up those clothes. They're important to me. Even if they're damaged, I have to pick them up! See, it was enough to ask nicely. Scram... they're not yours. What's on the roadside is anybody's! Not today. Clear off! Hey, I advise you to be careful! Yes. Scram! I don't ask for alms. God bless you! A tramp was already onto them, they were going fast. I should've stayed at home. My name's Colonna. Arthur Colonna. - What's this? - Want me to go see? No, stay there. Hi folks, can I help you? - Are you Mr Caron? - I am. We had a hard time finding you, hence the late hour. It's been a hard day. Hope we're not bothering you. Not at all. What can I do for you? Is it possible that this morning someone brought you ...a small Dutch car? Actually, the wreckage of a car. It's a DAF... green. Oh yes, it's here. You see, the car belonged to our son.... and his wife. I understand. And I was wondering if there mightn't be... by chance, some personal items still in the car. I know these things happen sometimes. My wife and I would very much like to get them back. If they're there, of course. Yes, yes, I understand. Come with me. It's usually the police who attend to such things. I know. The captain gave me whatever they found. But there may be other things. It may not be worth it for your wife to go up there. Jeanne, wait for me here, it won't be for long. Please! Monstrous! Monstrous! There it is. Could you... move this piece of metal for me… I'd like to look in the glove-box. Thank you. Thank you. Do you think the other shoe… might be under there? It's not likely. No. That's what I was telling myself. I suppose that we shouldn't be surprised. Let's go. I've been wasting your time. Only too glad to help. These days, nothing at all surprises me. You're certainly right, there. Well… it's been very good of you, Mr Caron. We're very grateful. - Don't mention it. - Thank you, Sir. Goodbye. So, where's the suitcase from? Oh dear... it's unbelievable! A day like this... will change everything for tomorrow. Money… cars, luggage. Even people. Leave in one car and come back in another. That suitcase... Borrowed? What suitcase? Of course... there's no suitcase anymore. But the contents are still there. Are you making out I stole it? Irrelevant. I'm not a thief. Okay, I'll shut up. Nevertheless... the contents were still extremely odd. I'd rather not talk about it. Isn't THAT strange? It's a harmless habit. Helps Robert to cope with travel sickness. Right, Robert? And you? What are you doing on this road? I was out of luck. I was on vacation with two colleagues and three families. We drew lots as to who went back with the car and the dog. I drew the short straw. The others flew back. You have a family? Just my mother and my sister. A car and a dog for three families? yes, with 3 Jaguars and three mastiffs, you risk attracting notice. You don't make sense. As little as possible. Good on you, Robert! Why are you slowing down? - Because we're going to stop. - Where? Somewhere where they sell suitcases. It's not urgent. Those Legions of Honour in my boot make me nervous. You can't wait to dump me? Replace the suitcase and "ciao"? Couldn't you be in a good mood for just a moment? I'll just say... I could find you amusing. But right now I feel wrung out. Really? A good reason to throw some money around. So... this suitcase isn't strong?! Fiberglass, two-year warranty. And that's not all. - Want to see more? - Yes. Roger, come over here. Make them stop! It's okay chaps, I'll take it. Enough! I'll take it! You won't regret it, Sir! - Be careful! - Sorry. The trousers... There's room. Wait! Is it all that important? And this/ What is it? That? - It's not ours. - No. It's the first time we've seen it Hettier, check out Jaeger, Jean-Claude. Born 4-8-40 in Versailles. OK. Say... we did pick up this hitchhiker. Because we were in a mess, we didn't find it. He's been on priority-search since this morning. He disappeared after an accident that caused the death of his wife. - Where did you drop him? - Near Orange. Look! He's in front of the sign. Come on! Mr Jaeger, Mr Jaeger! We've been looking for you since 8 this morning. Do you hear me? Mr Jaeger, do you remember the accident this morning? You have to be brave, your wife is deceased. But you have a son who needs you to come for him. A stretcher-case! He has some metal stuck in his neck. Really! Look! No need for a stretcher, gentlemen. I have to be in Nice for dinner. My in-laws are very strict. Yes? I'm coming. 2 rooms for the night. I only have one room. With twin beds. - Is there another hotel around here? - No, we're the only one. We'll take the room. Number? 22. Payable in advance. New regulations. Watch while the gentleman whips out his chequebook. What did I tell you? Quick as a flash! Why be disagreeable? I am getting over it, you know! Bags the shower! Come on! I'm taking the dog for a walk. Good evening. 188 dead, is the provisional toll for road accidents in 48 hours... and there is still 36 hours to the end of the weekend That's the headline news for today. The rest later. You lie down there. There! Lie down! Down! Good boy, lie down. There is no rational explanation to the series of accidents that occurred on the roads yesterday The nation-wide heat wave, while being a factor... in no way explains everything Why did six cars suddenly plummet over the parapet of a viaduct in the Isere, when the road was dry and there was no wind? Why was a toll-booth employee lynched to death by a group of Belgian tourists, respectable middle-aged family men, and without anyone intervening to defend the victim? So many questions which, this evening, remain unanswered. As yet, the Minister for the Interior has not issued a press-release. We are led to believe that the officials of the ministry are not in Paris. On the other hand, the few parliamentarians still in the capital regardless of party are stunned by the figures. It is not often that he government is speechless about what to consider as a political matter. This is as far as we could cover this story tonight. Tomorrows early morning news will give it full coverage with a number of people being interviewed. Juliette...? Ah, you had to check! Were you worried I'd pinched your car? Is that pile of junk so important to you? Okay, go to sleep now. You had a big day... me too. After all, we're not married. You felt like slapping me... out on the motorway... when I didn't want your cheque? Now you've done it! Feel better? What am I doing here? 2 left. The first one for… Florence… R-O-U-V-I-E-R. 50 kicks in the stomach. The date… One left. It's the last. Can't miss it. To Juliette… Delors. How much? 30,000? No... 50,000 frances. No "e". There. Good! Not my day. Nothing but crap. Let's take a peek... Credit card, security card... Driver's licence. Small letter. Second small letter. Darling… a fortnight gone and I still haven't heard from you. Where are you? What are you doing? I can't go on like this.. Please just give me some sign of life! I spend my life waiting on a phone call or a letter. The girls at the club think I look unwell, even though I'm tanned... all over, as you asked me to." Leave off! Poor thing! I'm sure she looks better without a tan. Juliette… I know I'm no genius... You've made that clear to me. But I really feel something has gone haywire, Arthur. Leave it... I'll tell you. I turned 25, day before yesterday, but I see you forgot... ...like the 1000 francs that you promised me. Just a quick phone call, Arthur. That's all I ask. It would cheer me up. I hug you with all the strength I possess Call me quickly... I can't take it anymore. Monique. "P.S. The double bed was delivered to me. You'll have nothing to complain about. I beg you, Arthur! I can't stand it anymore! It's too much, Arthur, it's too much! I want to go home. Arthur, I'm cold! It's as hot as hell. I'm cold. Arthur, take off my panties... They're pinching me. You're a decent sort of guy, aren't you? Yes. You really are! It's moving! It's moving! - The boat's moving! - I'll secure it. Yes, darling. You're the captain. Yes, I have a beard. Yes. Yes, yes. You know what you're going to do when we get to Paris? You're going to take those things and get them fixed. Properly stitched up, and cleaned. There are guys who are very good at it. And then? You'll make a big parcel and send it to Montpellier. Yes, with a very nice letter! He'll understand, eh? If he has problems with it, he'll still understand yours. I'd think so. Don't worry about your job. You won't be fired. You might be moved. But not fired. There'd be reason, it'd be too serious. Come on, don't worry, my little Juliette. What would you say to Holland? Two weeks in Holland. Holland's nice. It'd be cooler up there. Know Holland? Not at all. What can I say about it? The mills, the…. the canals… the… the tulips. The… Arthur, slow down a bit. - You're almost doing 150. - Sorry. Trouble is I've lose my speed position. You slow down, and they take advantage. You don't find it extraordinary? Find what? That yesterday you burst a suitcase open... You're speaking of an introduction, that almost cost me a headlamp. Otherwise, we'd never have met. Yeah… - What's he doing? - What's happening? Straighten up! I can't! Don't worry, we take care of you. - No injuries. - It's OK! OK. Can you get in there? Arthur, the dog! Robert! I'll free you, my boy! Arthur! Let him out! Please! He'll kill him! Do something! Stop it! Do something! Quick! It's terrible! - I'll get the gun. - No, don't be stupid! - Yes! yes! - You're mad? No! Shoot it! Go on, shoot it, I tell you! Do it! - Oh, Arthur, come here! - The dog… Come and lie down. Come on. My dog! My dog! She told me to shoot it! She told me to shoot it! Lie down. They killed Robert! No... lie down... calm down...! - Here's a blanket. - Thank you. No, no. No, you have to lie down. Thank you Sir, what do I owe you? There's no need for that now, Arthur. Put that away. Come on, lie down. He's losing his mind. The ambulance is coming. Lie quietly! - Are you alright? - Yes. It's OK. Quick, the stretcher! Get an infusion ready! You can move? Sort of. Gently! - Let go of him, ma'am! - I can't! - Are you his wife? - Wife? No. Well, let go of him! No way! Get moving! My suitcase! My suitcase… My suitcase… Subtitles by FatPlank for KG
