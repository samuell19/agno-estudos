Nick? What were you thinking, you know, just now when you... You wandered? Oh, uh, the... Uh, the blog entry. Oh, the one that was troubling you, did you finish it? Yeah, yeah, it's done. Oh, 'cause you had mentioned that it... It took longer than expected to write it. Why do you think that was? You know, I'm not really sure. Hmm. How's Lexi? She's good. And how's the communication with her? Uh, you know. We still have our moments. Why do you think that is? You know, I couldn't say. Perhaps that's why I'm here. And... ...Donny and Emile? Donny and Emile? - There he is. - Hey, Bob. - How you doing, Emile? - Good. How are you? Good, good. You know, I'll just get the usual. You know, a little vodka. Just one of them today. - And maybe some cigarettes? - Cigarettes? You got it. Yeah? You know, I'm going to an AA meeting. I'm going to the meetings, so I can't... No, I can't just... You know, moderation. - That's the key. - Sounds good. How's the gig? I heard you had some gigs going? - Uh, yeah, not right now. - Not right now? But, yeah, maybe in the future, you know? - Okay. - Cross your fingers. Yeah, yeah, fingers crossed. Yeah, yeah. Good to see you. I'll bag this up and then we'll... I appreciate it. Yeah, yeah. I wouldn't want anybody... My AA people to see it, you know? - Exactly. - I'll be good, though. - All right, here you go, Bob. - Thank you so much. And I'll see you next time, okay? - Sounds good. - Okay. Hey, can I help you? Oh! Finally some help. Uh, I've been walking around this place for 15 minutes, and you've been up there with Bob. I'm sorry. Well, I don't want to hear it. Can you just... Can you just tell me where I could find a good zinfandel? Yeah, do you want red or white? Red. Maggie, you were so close. It's right here. There you go. - Thank you. - Mm-hmm. Hey, Emile. Sorry I'm late. I'm gonna go clock in. That's okay, Mike. I already dropped the till. You're fine. Donny, Donny. I can hear people in the background. Are you there? I'm itching, dude. Please. Come on, pick up the fucking phone. I can hear... Are you on the line, man? Hey, Donny? Now's not really a good time, Emile. Yeah, okay. We need to talk. I know you're busy. You're always fucking busy. But if you could just spare, like, a second... Yeah, you know, I'm right in the middle of my girl's birthday party, so I really can't. No, right. I just... I need to talk right now. I'll talk to you later. Hello? Donny? He'll keep calling. What's up? Hey, you hear from Emile? Yeah, yeah. Why? Well, he's really off. Like, more than usual. I mean, I kinda feel like that's his new norm. Yeah, I get that, but I think we should go over there. I don't think I really can right now. Look, he's got no one else. You already know this. Please, I just think we gotta go over there. Okay. All right, well, what? His place or what? His house. Let's go now. Did I ever tell you that you're the best? You don't have to. I already know. I know you know. What the hell took you so long? I'm, like, five minutes late. Calm down. It's my daughter's fucking birthday party, all right? - I get it. I get it. - All right, well, look, you didn't have to wait for me. Let's go. I thought it'd be better this way. Okay, what the hell is going on, dude? Take a breath. What's up? Walk us through it. You guys don't seem half as fucked up as I am and I don't fucking get it. We deal with things in different ways. We talked about this before. Yeah, but how? How the fuck do you guys do it? I work at a fucking liquor store in the middle of this shit town, and then I come home and I drink away every good memory I've ever had. - How the fuck did I get here? - As hard as this is, you've need to try to keep yourself together, man. We've talked about this. Take a fucking breath. I know it's hard, but you can't keep losing it like this. You think I fucking chose this, Nick? And you. You and your stupid car, and your stupid... Don't get mad at us. This isn't gonna help anything. Your stupid perfect life. My stupid perfect life? - Don't do that shit. - Look, I get it. No, you don't get it. Look, if you don't deal with this shit now, man, then it's only gonna get worse, okay? What, you wanna yell at us every month? You wanna go through this same bullshit? Then, yeah. Fine, do it. You know, why don't you just do us all a favor and just drink yourself to death? That way we don't have to come back here and keep doing this shit. He's right. I'm not like you guys. I wish I could just slap on a better face, but I can't. Look, Emile, we're here for you. Donny left his daughter's birthday party to be here. You did? Thanks. I'm not mad at you. You sure about that? I think what Donny's trying to say is we can't keep doing this. Not once a week, not every month. It's not good for any of us. We just wanna live normal lives. Well, you gonna offer us a drink or, uh, are we just gonna sit here and watch you drink? Well, now... - Dude, Donny. - Hmm? You gotta do Christopher Walken. - No. - Dude, Emile, he did the monologue from "Pulp Fiction" last weekend. Dude, that shit was on point. I wanna hear it. Do it, Donny. Uh, okay. All right. You see this? This was your great grandfather's war watch, and he wore this every day that he was in the war. And he kept this watch hidden up his butt so he could sneak it through... - Hey, Donny! - Hey, Coach. - Boys. - Hey. The last quarter, huh? Dang. Yep, I know. Thought I had it. I really thought you were gonna catch that. That one would've really taken us home. - We all did. - Anyways, good game. - See you, Coach. - And watch out for these characters. Hey, boys, pick up the pace. You know, a little birdy told me you were going to a movie and not inviting me. We were totally gonna invite you. - Mm. - Yeah. Mm. Jess, do Thumper. It's Flower the skunk, not Thumper. Duh. Okay, Jess, do Flower then. I'm not a flower, but you can call me Flower if you wants to. That's good. What time is the movie? It's at 7:30. I'll see you there. Pew, pew! - I'm gonna marry that girl. - I know. I knew you were gonna say that. Yeah. Yeah, me, too. - Right? - Yeah, all three of us will. No, we can't all marry her. We could all marry her. It's easy. - It's not fucking Utah. - It's legal somewhere. That's right. Let's go. - Is he out? - Yeah. You taking off? Yeah. You staying? Oh, shit. One sec. One sec. Hey, babe. See you in a bit. I love you too. Bye. - Was that Lexi? - Yeah, what are you thinking? Well, let's just let him sleep it off. Yeah, I guess that's all we can do. Yeah. Well, you staying? I have to. All right, well, I'm gonna take off, - but, uh, you get some sleep. - Yeah, sounds good. Hey. Hey. Morning. So... ...what exactly happened last night? Just Emile being Emile. He was in a bad state. It seems like that's been happening a lot lately. Are you going to keep showing up to save him every time he calls you? I just... I don't think it's good for you. Not good for me? Babe, I don't think it's good for anybody. We see this all the time at the hospital, these enablers. I know. I know. You're my enabler. Don't do that to me, Nicholas. Don't be cute with me. - What? Me? - Was Donny there? What do you think? I think he was. Save it, okay? I already know what you're gonna say. No, no. No, you don't. Well, what then? I don't hate all of your friends, you know? Right. I don't hate anybody. I just... I love you too much. I love you too much, too. Good luck on the article today. Thanks. Oh, hey, dude. Oh, hey, man. How's it going? - Good. Yeah? - Good. I wanted to, uh, replenish your stash that I polished off last night. You gotta stop coming over and drinking all my alcohol. Yeah, dude, I don't know what the hell got into me last night. - I'm sorry. - Don't worry about it, man. - It's okay. - No, it's not okay though. I mean, it's insane. It's been, like, ten years. I don't know, I just got this, like, fucking fog in my head, and I just... it's just happening more and more. Like every other week. - More like daily. - I'm trying to be serious. I know you are. I appreciate it. Thanks. Well, you don't have to get this, dude. It's on me. All right. Well, $17.50. You didn't even ring it up. Got it all memorized. Last night was crazy, man. - Yeah, I know. - That was so much fun. - Yeah, it was. - Maybe a little too much fun, huh? Yeah, I drank quite a bit. I think I drank a whole fifth. Yeah, I think so. What are you up to now? Uh, I don't know really. Maybe just go home and chill. Watch some TV. There's Donny right there. - Oh, weird. - Yo. What's up, guys? What are you doing? You playing hooky? Just came here to replenish the whiskey stash from last night. Oh, what, that we drank? No. - Yeah. - That guy. Well, hey, you guys wanna get a drink? - Uh, right now? - Yeah, I'll buy. Fuck yeah. I'm down. Okay, yeah. Why the hell not? Let's do it. All right, why the hell not? - Let's go. - All right, let's do it. I swear to God that happened to me. That would happen to you. Yeah, well, you should've done that drunk. Yeah, I should've. Where the hell were you when I needed? Mm-hmm. So, Nick, what's your next article on, eh, paper boy? It's on the mental asylum outside of town. That's fucking depressing. It's got a long history, police station attached. - Hmm. Hmm. - It's really weird. You know, I think you'd really like it. I'm depressed, I'm not fucking crazy, okay? - Debatable. - Shut up. Can I bring you anything else? Nah, I think we're okay right now. We're good, thanks. So how's real estate? Uh, it's not too bad. It's actually going pretty good. I just bought 100 acres up north. We're gonna start developing on that soon, so that's pretty good. Yeah, that's a lot of fucking land. Can't complain. But, hey, you know what? What I'm doing is the easy stuff. What you do is the hard stuff. Oh, yeah? If by hard stuff you mean working endless hours, getting paid shit, then, yeah, I do the hard shit. You know, I don't know, guys. I love writing so much. You know this. Um, it's just I've been doing it so long and it's so stressful sometimes. I wonder if a career change is in order for me. You've always been good at this stuff, dude. I mean, I've read your diary. What? His diary? - He means my blog. - Oh, okay. Yeah. Yeah, same difference. I would tell you if it wasn't good, man. Hey, you know what? You're doing what you love. That's what counts. Yeah, you don't need to be so hard on yourself, man. Yeah, thanks, you guys. I just don't wanna lose the spark, I guess. Nah. No, you won't. Hey, you know what? Cheers to Lexi, right? And her stable job. - What's up? Cheers. - Cheers to that. What about Vacant Youth? Yeah, it's a solo project now. - Yeah. - Yeah, well, hey, you guys used to kill it for a small local band, dude. Yeah, I still listen to that album. Yeah, I appreciate that. I just wanted more control of the project, so it made more sense for me to head the whole thing up. I actually have a few songs that are almost done if you guys wanna take a listen. - Awesome. - Yeah. Can you guys believe it's been ten years? Hey, um, Briana, love, could you get me another round, please? Thanks, love. Who's that? It's Lex. Not even engaged yet, huh? - Yep. - Yet? What's taking you so long, man? - I got plans, man. - Oh, well, shit. The man's got plans at least, right? In fact, you guys, you gotta check this out. - Oh, my gosh, dude. - Look at that. - Holy shit. Congrats, dude. - Yeah. Now you guys are gonna have to fight over who's best man. - We'll toss a coin. - Yeah, well, she's probably wondering where I'm at, so... Mmm. Donny, thanks for the drinks. Oh, I'm not paying. You bastard. See you, Emile. See you, Donny. See you, man. What'd you say the other night? What? The other night, you said something. I don't know what you're talking about. Are you joking? I don't. I don't know what you're talking about. I'm just messing with you, dude. Yeah. Hey, you know what? Uh, why don't you get us some more beer? I'm gonna go hit the can. - Yep, sure. - Sound good? All right. You're the guy fucking with my niece, right? No, I'm happily married. I know guys like you. Look, I don't know who your niece is. Hey, you know, maybe we got off on the wrong foot. Can I buy you a drink? We good? She doesn't listen to me. Let's take that back a little bit. Why did you say she understood? Well, she doesn't actively listen to me. - There is a difference, right? - Yes, but... She has something to say about everything that I do. Well, she cares about you. Oh, Nick. People who care about you care about what you do to yourself. Emile. Oh, hey, guys. Hey, we got tickets for Saturday. You're gonna go? Yeah, wouldn't miss it. Yeah. Thank you, yeah. We just wanna fill that venue for once, so... Okay. I can't wait to see the drum solo. It's gonna be so good. What do we got? We got nothing. We got no DNA. No fingerprints at either crime scene. Either we were too late... - Popcorn? - ...or too sloppy. Sloppy. I'd go for sloppy, yeah. Or this guy might've just... You're gonna get us kicked out. No, I'm not. - Idiot. - Okay, fine. ...that report should be done by the end of the day. And obviously on the first vic, well, she was cut to fucking pieces. Was she raped? - No. - No, she wasn't? No. No, she wasn't raped. And that's... that's what's weird about this. And that's just it. If it was something like that, this would make sense, but it doesn't. It's like... We missed something. - That's it? - That's it. That's what we got? We got nothing. See you on Monday in math class, huh? - Hell yeah. - All right. - Oh, hey, Jess. - Hey, Conner. What's up? - What's up? - Hey, Jess. Um, you like the movie so far? Yeah, it's really good. Yeah, it is. Do you like living at Donny's house? Uh, you know, I should probably get back in there. I don't wanna miss anything. - Yeah. - Yeah, see you in there. Um, I'm just gonna use the restroom. So, what'd you think? I thought that movie was really good. Didn't know you liked action movies. Thought you got enough craziness at home. Oh, shit. Jess, I mean, I didn't mean it like that. No, it's cool. I, uh, felt bad asking about Donny's house, so I guess we're kinda even. Oh, come on, Jess. It's not like that. Did your dad do that to you? Ugh, I do not want to go home yet. I don't want to either. Nick, what the hell are you doing? Just getting the door. Just messing with you, dude. Well, I was thinking if you wanted to... - You think? - I do think, believe it or not. I have some beers left over from last week's band practice, but we can't drink them at my place. Did you say beers? Dude, you guys, get this. My uncle just bought a place just a couple miles from here. We can camp there, do beers, fire. - Beers? - Sounds fun. I'll, um, grab a blanket from my car. - Cool. - Nick? Nick? Yeah. I mean, okay. Let's do it. - Okay, let's do it. - All right. Well, that's a new story. Why do you think you thought of it? Um... ...no reason. Uh, that's, uh... That's probably time though. All right. What'd you say the other night? Dinner's almost ready. You took tonight off work? I'm covering Roxanne's shift tomorrow. Ooh, lucky me. And I got the 19th off! So you're telling me that I'm gonna have the sexiest date at the reunion? Well, isn't Erin Sanders going to be there? Yeah, but Donny says she's wearing a trash bag. That woman will look good in anything. Nah, she's, like, a hard seven. Don't. Please don't. - Hey. - Donny is freaking me out, man. I don't know. It was something about what I said the other night, like, when I was passed out. I don't really remember it. Whoa, slow down. Donny said something? No, you don't get it. He does this thing, and it's, like, super fucking intense, and he only fucking does it to me. Did you piss him off or something? Did he say something to you? No, nothing out of the ordinary. You can't deny the fact that he's different or something's off ever since... Don't. Don't go there. I'm not. You kinda were. You should hear yourself right now. Yeah, I know I'm not okay. Eat something. Get some rest. Yeah. You wanna come inside? You're too good for me. You know, I actually have to run an errand tonight. I have to pick up the plans for work tomorrow. But I'll be back. You promise? Mm-hmm. I promise. Oh, hey, Mike, lock the back door, too. Say it louder. I'm not a flower, but you can call me Flower if you... It's Friday night. Turnt up. No, but for real. Did you hear about this girl? Um, I haven't, actually. I mean, everybody's talking about it, so... - Yeah. - It's impossible not to know. It's real. I'm not a fucking loser. People have been talking about it for a long time. Yeah, well, my mom told me she's dead. No, I heard she went missing. Not dead. Well, no, my mom told me she's dead. My mom told me her dad beat her death, and she's dead. Well, I heard that she's just been missing for ten years without a clue. That case was closed. - Ladies. - Mmm. Yummy. - Hi. - Hello. Good move, Grandpa. - Nick. - Oh, hey. Twice in one week. How are you? Good. It's Lindsay, right? Yeah, I was best friends with... We went to high school together. - Yeah. - Mr. Shulman's class. Can you believe it's been a decade? - I feel old. - Oh, Lindsay, this is my grandpa Charles. I know Charles. Your grandpa, well, now I know where Nick gets his good looks from. Your grandson is interviewing my boss. You must be proud. - Nick, it's this way. - Thanks. Charles, I'll see you later. All right, Grandpa. Love you. Nick Graves. Warden Williamson. Warden, thanks for meeting with me today. My pleasure. It's not every day that we get an opportunity to do an interview. Well, uh... Shall we dive right in? So there's a lot of interest in your mental hospital and its patients. You know, I think there's a natural curiosity to an asylum and those that are contained in one. - Contained? - Well, for lack of better words, of course. Nick, I would like to revisit the email that I sent you. I wanna make sure that I can proofread the interview before you publish it to your blog. - Funding is everything. - Of course. Now you have more questions for me, yeah? Um, what kind of patients do you typically admit to this hospital? Well, that's a very broad question, Nick. I mean, are they typically dangerous to society? Some cases, they can be, sure. We have people that self-admit so as to prevent harm to themselves. We have people that are here for the 24-hour care. And, of course, we have the state mandated cases. But remember, we have several different wards. How do you verify if a patient needs care? What is your verification process entail? That happens all the time here. Nick, are you okay? I, uh... I think I got all I need. Uh, but we haven't even... I just... "There once was a beautiful young princess," just like you two. "And she fell in love with a dashing young prince. Now, they were set to be married, and she was gonna become queen. But the night before the wedding, the princess became horribly ill." - Oh, no. - Yeah. "She couldn't wake up from it." Yeah. The young prince, he was so heartbroken that he locked himself away in the attic way up high." - Yeah? - Yeah. "And that night, the prince, he was haunted by her spirit. And he begged the princess to leave him alone. But she couldn't. She loved him too much. A celebration of her life was held in the afternoon, and upon checking the grave, to the whole town's surprise, there was no young bride-to-be. The princess was gone. The prince rested his hand on the empty coffin. And he thought to himself... in this life or the next... ...that she would never be forgotten." - Hey, Nick. - Hi, Erin. - Come on in. - Thanks. All right, girls, it's time for bed. Let's go. Come on. Come on, girls. Follow Mommy. - I'm not... - You can draw upstairs. Come on. Last one upstairs is a rotten egg. - I know. - Come on. Ready? Bring your book with you. I'm gonna take your blanket and your doll. - Come with me. Come on. - Hey, Nick. Come on, girls. Upstairs. Upstairs. Hey, Donny. Sorry to show up like this. You want a drink? You know, I think I'm okay. Are you sure? - Yeah, I'm okay. - What's up? Dude, Emile's not doing okay. I thought we kind of already established that. Yeah, except he's doing worse than he normally is. In what way? Dude, he's freaking out about you. - About me? - Yeah. What does that mean? I don't know, Donny. I was hoping you could tell me. Look, Emile is sort of dragging you around right now, and I think you know that. At least I hope you do. Why the fuck does everybody say that to me? Well, 'cause it's true. Okay, so it's true. All I wanna know is what you said to him. That's it. I... I didn't say anything. Look, Emile is very obsessive, okay? And I just happened to be the obsession of the week. That's what this is. I've always been there for him, and for you for that matter, okay? So I don't know why you're letting him control you like this. I am not letting him control me, Donny. I can't keep picking up the pieces, Nick, of every time that Emile has a breakdown. I have a family now, okay? I'm growing up. I suggest you do the same. You know, Donny, I wasn't trying to make this a big thing. All I was trying to do was give you the information that I know so that we're on the same fucking page. What I'm trying to tell you is that trying to fix everything is not helping him. Donny? Yeah, I'll keep it down. - Sorry, babe. - I just got 'em to sleep. It's okay. I was just leaving. I just want us to go back to the way we were. Yeah, uh... I mean, Donny's been one of my closest friends for, gosh, I don't know how long. Come on, Emile. You gotta help me out here. - I don't know. - I talked to Donny. He's the same guy he's always been. Nothing's different. Look, I think you're just trying to find something to be upset about now. Look, he means you no harm. - Here you guys go. - Thank you. There he is right now. When you guys said lunch, I didn't realize it was a romantic date. Isn't this sweet? Oh, shit, is this, like, a serious conversation? Kinda, yeah. Oh, okay. Well, where were we? Um, well, uh, we were just talking about how things have been going on lately. I mean, uh, um, you probably don't have time for that. Oh, for you guys? Nah. No, I've got time. I can make time. Emile was thinking about seeing a therapist. - Really? - I think it would help. I'm not sure that it would. I see one, actually. Nick, what do you need a therapist for? My grandpa, he's getting older. Watching him deteriorate like that, it's just hard to watch. And, uh, he helps me process it. Okay, well, that's life. Yeah, but my therapist helps me process life. I mean, I think everybody could use a good therapist. Well, look, I just wanted to say this out loud because I know I've been putting you guys on edge lately. But, you know, I just have a lot at home going on. You know, family, and with work, and then of course the reunion, it's just... stack it all on top, it's a lot to juggle, and I... Gosh, I'm trying my best. It's not just you, Donny. What does that mean? I can feel it in the air. I can feel it when I wake up. It hums in my head and it echoes down my hallways. And the more I try to get rid of it, the quicker it creeps in. Can't get it out of my head. I think something is happening. I know you guys can feel it, too. I can't get away from that night. Look, Emile, you can't keep living in the past, okay? And, Nick, why are you letting him live out this sick cycle? I'm just trying to let him know that we're here for him. This was never supposed to be a big deal. Like, drinks the other night, this was just supposed to be a sit down lunch. Yeah, but, like, what? In this public diner in front of everyone? You know what this is? You two love to draw attention to yourselves. That's what this is, okay? And if you focus more on other people and less on yourselves, then you'd be way better off. I do focus more on other people, and I think that's my problem. You know, Donny, how come every time I feel something, it's like I'm not allowed to? Like, it's not correct or justified in your eyes? You know, I'm happy for you actually. It must be so nice to not have to fucking worry about any of this. Okay. I get it, okay? But, look, I just want you guys to know I'm not the bad guy, okay? You can talk to me. You can. And I know we're all a little different, but I'm here. I mean, Emile's got a point, Donny. Yeah, and it doesn't change the fact that you haven't been a great friend recently. I mean, you're fucking all over the place. That's fair, okay? And I get it. I do. But here's the thing. There's some stuff that should just stay just between us three. No therapist. Nobody. Right? Because, you know, trying to pretend like these things didn't happen in the past, well, that's not gonna fix anything, okay? Looking straight forward and moving on and fixing your problems and facing them, that is how you do it, just like I did. And I promise I'll do better. I'm gonna try harder. And, yeah, you guys just gotta cut me a break. All right? Yeah, okay. Awesome. Oh, shit. Well, I gotta go. Did you pay the power bill? Nah, that's so weird. They never sent the new one. I'm surprised the power hasn't been shut off yet. Ah, well... ...I better go get ready to see Grandpa. Well, tell him I say happy birthday. I will. Thank you so much for being so supportive of me and my grandpa. Of course. I already feel like you're part of the family. Me too. All right, well, I love you very much. I love you. See ya. Getting up there, old man. Good night, Grandpa. Happy birthday. No! Do you need a nurse? I know you. I'm Charles' grandson. I know you! There you are. Nick, I'm sorry about that. How do you sneak away like that? You scared me to death. You shouldn't do that anymore, all right? Uh, it's okay, he just... He just startled me. This guy ends up startling everybody. - Poor guy. - Poor guy? No. You know who he is, right? It's hard to stay unbiased, you know? I mean, who knows what happened or what goes on inside someone's head? Let's go ahead and get you back to your room, all right? Come on. You okay? Looking for these? Don't say anything just yet. I wanna put something in your head. Something that you can think about. You know, stalking your friends can be really disheartening, especially when you've known them as long as you've known me. It really makes you question... Donny. I don't wanna question our friendship. All right? Right. Good, good. Oh, my God. Please help me, doctor. - Who are you? - Oh, I just can't seem to get these thoughts out of my head. How can I help you? Well, since you asked, I have these friends, you see, and they just keep bringing up these things from the past that they just can't get over. And then it, well... Just, I don't know. Maybe I need a therapist, right? Oh, hey! You could help me. You must be Donny, right? You're Nick's friend. You're really good at this. Donny, why did you come to my home? Eh, well, shoot, doc. I can't really be seen going to your office, not a man of my reputation. No. All right. Uh, let's talk. Okay, well, I'm very troubled with what Nick Graves has been sharing with you. Can I? Is this authentic? Yes, well, my grandfather worked with him. I appreciate a man with class. I can tell that about you. So, Donny, what brings you here tonight? I already told you. I'm troubled with what Nick Graves has told you. Well, you know I can't talk to you about my patients. That's part of the rules. I'm sure a smart, successful man like yourself understands that. Hey, you know, I read your notes. You wrote something in there. Aggressive, anxious. Even wrote something about me. It's your friend, right? Wouldn't you expect for him to bring you up? No. No, your notes felt incomplete. And why is that? Well, it's like you don't even know me. Donny, I know you're a smart man. And, well, breaking in to my office in my home can be an indication that you might need someone to talk to. I can be that someone. We could even meet here so nobody has to know about it. - Would you like that? - Oh, yeah. Sounds great, doc. Hey, did you say something? Did you say indication? An indication? You know, I think I would like to do that right now. Yeah, but I think I need to be seated right there. Of course. Was there anything missing from Nick's file? Anything at all? Missing? I document everything, and that is the full file. Donny. Can I get a bottle of water from the refrigerator? Sure. Nick? Good morning. Dr. Caplan's dead. Wait, what? His daughter found him this morning in his office. Nick. Nick, he was murdered. I'm gonna call off work. Did they say how he was killed? No. - I'm gonna call in, babe. - No, no. It's okay. Are you sure? Okay. Well, call me if you need anything. I love you. Nice lap, babe. I try. Do you think I should have the pool cleaned before Saturday? I think that the pool could be dark green and still be the nicest pool they've ever seen. Are you gonna get in with me? I have to be able to hear the girls. I think you can hear them from here. I think that I would be very, very distracted. Oh, you think so? Yes. Well, that wouldn't be a bad thing. Donny. Is Nick home? I needed to talk to him. Hey, Emile. Hey, babe. Emile's here. - He looks terrible. - Hmm. Okay, thank you. What are you doing here? We need to talk. Please. Okay. All right, start from the beginning. I don't even know where to start. I'm sorry. It's probably so weird, me showing up here like this. - Don't hate me. - No. It's okay. Just, I'm not really following what you're trying to say. I just need you to listen as best you can and try to understand where I'm coming from. You're always saying how much you want me to get better, and, you know, you've looked after me for, like, a really long time. I don't think you'll ever understand how much I truly appreciate that. Look, Emile, you're freaking me out. I don't think I can keep this up anymore. Okay, well, just spit it out then, okay? We're going through the same shit again. You're freaking my girlfriend out. What is it? I think Donny is lying to us. He hides shit from us. I don't even think we know who he is. I mean, I saw him with this prostitute. It was so fucking weird, Nick. They looked just like Jess. There's nothing wrong with Donny, okay? Nothing's different. Donny's our friend. You don't have to believe me, but it's the truth. So what if it's true? So he got a prostitute? So what? Maybe you wouldn't do it. - He did. - You're so fucking blind. I'm sorry. I'd rather be blind than fucking crazy. That's what you think this is? Me being crazy? Okay, sure, maybe you should lock me up. But it's not gonna change the fucking truth, man. Look, Emile, this is an awful lot to swallow, okay? What the fuck do you want me to do about this? You believe him over me? Look, Donny didn't say or do anything. You're delusional, okay? Is this about her? You want his life? You're never gonna have his fucking life. I mean, Lexi doesn't even know you. She doesn't even know the real you. Look, Emile, I don't know what I can do for you anymore, man, okay? - I can't. - That's fucking perfect. And you know what? He was never a real friend to us. He was never even a real fucking person! Fuck! God damn it! Fuck! Fuck you, man! Fuck you too, man. I said 20 minutes. What the fuck happened? What am I paying you for? Hey. I'll be right back. Nick. Lexi. - There he is right now. - Hi. Oh, hey, Donny. - How's it going? - Good. How you doing? - Good. - This is stunning. Oh, yeah. Well, you can't beat it. Yeah, I told you, babe. Not a penny spared. Uh, I'm gonna go help Erin. - Oh, yeah, she'd love that. - Sounds good. How's it going, man? - Good. How you doing? - Not bad. Think he'll show? Mm. I mean, he's kind of unstable right now, so who knows what he's capable of? I just wish things would go back to the way they were. Yeah, well, here we go. - Donny. Donny Sanders. - Yeah. - This house is fucking amazing. - Oh, thanks. - It's, uh, uh... - Kyle, right? - Yeah. - Hey, the one and only! That's right. Yeah, the only with a little less hair. Right. Great. Uh, hey, tell me, uh, how much did you get this place for? Okay, Kyle. Hey, look, I'm actually in the middle of talking with Nick right now, but I'll be with you in a bit, okay? Oh, yeah, yeah. That's fine. Yo, I can't wait until Tony gets here. He's gonna lose his shit! Yeah! Sick. He will. - Careful there, Kyle. Careful. - All right, Kyle. - That's crazy. - Yeah. Yeah, I don't hate this shit, but I certainly don't love it either. We're gonna be having the same fucking conversation all night, huh? - Oh, yeah. - Remember her? How could I forget? It's Jessica's sidekick. Yeah. Donny, Emile showed up at my house last night high as a kite. I'm just... I'm worried about it, man. Just worried he might harm someone. You think he's capable of that? I'm sure of it. - Honey. - Oh, hey. The DJ wants to know when he can kick things off. Uh, you know what? No better time than now. Right? Let's do it. - You ready? - Let's do it. Let's go. Hey, class of 2011! Welcome to your ten-year high school reunion! All right, guys, now the party's just getting started, so we're gonna bring a dance floor out here in a minute. So if you haven't grabbed a drink or a partner... Talking to you... I suggest you do so right now! Get the fuck off. Hey, everybody. I know this bullshit's going on right now. Here's the deal. You guys are gonna listen to me for one goddamn second, okay? No, you don't fucking move! I'm not trying to be rude... but you don't fucking move an inch. I've been holding this in for so goddamn long. But tonight, I'm gonna let it all out. And I'm gonna take you fuckers with me. Donny, this place is so cool. Yeah, you know, my uncle picked this place up not that far back, and pretty much everything around it, so we can come here whenever we want. This place is sick. Why haven't we done this before? I don't know. Emile, this beer sucks. Come on, dude. It was, like, short notice. It was the best I could do, all right? Hey, Jess, you know, you and I could just come here sometime. I mean, it's fun now, right? Yeah, but it'd be nice if we could just be alone. Okay. Thanks. Well, it's mine now. Thanks. So, you guys, get this. There was this king, right? And he sets out this decree or whatever it's called to set up this... This tournament, right? And it's for these three knights, and it's to win the hand of his daughter the princess. Mm. And so, go. Go? Just go. Yeah, it's your turn. All right, a knight you said? - Okay. - Yeah. So one of the knights, he, uh... He goes to fight a troll. Does that work? He goes to fight a troll. He ends up winning, and he's really tired, so he just goes home afterwards. I don't know! I don't know. I don't know. - You go, dude. - Uh, okay. - "And he goes home." - Um, okay, okay. So that first knight, even though he went home, right when he got home, all the trolls' little sons were there, and they decided to kill him. So he died immediately. The other two knights that were left, they end up actually battling a huge frickin' dragon, okay? They're a little bit cleverer this time, and they take a dagger straight to the dragon's neck. Bleeds out over the place. Here comes the princess. She comes swooping in. She wants, actually, to be with one of these knights. - See what I'm saying? - Yeah. So they're about to, you know. - We get it. - What a princess would do with a knight. - Stab him. - Except you're missing one key element. - What? - The first knight, he had a special set of armor that was given to him by the princess. Okay, so he had the special armor. Whatever. That's fine. But that doesn't help him, not with that kind of dragon. No, but it totally does, because the other knight, she gave him the wrong armor. She didn't want him. Okay, well, that's... That's bullshit. It's just a story. - But that's not the rule. - It doesn't matter. It's made up. Anyways, anybody want a drink? Uh, yeah, I'll take one. - What are you doing, Donny? - I'm not doing anything. Shit. Too much, Donny. - Jess. - Dude, no. - Wait. - Get off of me! Jess? Oh, fuck. - Dude, what did you do? - Fuck. I... I didn't do anything. Oh, what the fuck, man? I just, like, pushed her. - It's Jess, man. - We have to see if she's okay. We should go down there. Jess? Jess, no, no. No, no, no. - No. - No, Nick. Stop. Don't touch the body. - Don't touch her. - Oh, my God. What do we do now? We have to... We have to hide the body. They're going to think we fucking killed her. No. - Come on. Let's go. - No! - Come on. Go. - No. No. Nick Graves! We have a warrant for your arrest. - Lex. - All these years. You hid this from me for ten years, Nick. - Ten years. - You don't understand the whole story. They found evidence, Nick. You guys are guilty. I made a mistake, okay? I'm not that person anymore. - You know who I am. - I don't know at all! You know me. You know me! Well, you boys have been getting into trouble since the day I died. You know, I was so confused when I came to. I mean, my mouth was dry, my head was pounding, my ears were ringing, and I was in a fucking hole. I kept thinking, "Donny, well, yeah, he'd leave me." And I hate to admit it, but that stung a little. And then there was Emile, and he was always so weak. But you? You would never leave me, right? But you did. An elderly woman nursed me back to health. It was then that I realized I was the headline in a missing persons case. And I thought, "This is it, my way out. My way to a new life." No more abusive father, no more shitty friends. I mean, you handed me the keys to the kingdom of freedom. I was happy. But... ...my poor Aunt Maggie never stopped looking for me. And this... ...this is what got me. The fact that you three got away with my murder. Fucking murder. You know, Emile was easy, and Donny was always so quick to violence. You fucking bitch. Hey! If you could leave a body in the woods, well, I could only imagine how you'd feel if the secret got out, got the best of you, destroyed your life, your whole world. And then that testimony against my father, I mean... I mean, I never knew he could be such a savage. And all I had to do was plant the blanket and it was a done deal. You did your best. It's sad though, 'cause we all know your best wasn't good enough. You picked the wrong friends. And in case you're wondering, I have a wonderful life with a beautiful family, something neither of you will ever know again. You fucking look at me. You look at me, you stupid bitch. You're not gonna get away with this, bitch. I wish things could've been different. A gift for you, Donny. Fucking bitch! Let go of me! You fucking bitch! Look at me! You fucking bitch! You stupid fucking bitch! Fuck! Fuck!
