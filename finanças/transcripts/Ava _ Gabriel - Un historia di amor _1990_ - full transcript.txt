Sugar could not claim its own sweetness... ...but isn't my daughter precious looking? She resembles me, don't you think so? Yes, but the father's complexion does quite a bit for her, right? What a shame. Look how Delia mistreated that satin fabric. That child of her looks like a plucked chicken. It doesn't matter. As long as they buy their fabrics from us, right? You better watch out, mister. You are lucky nothing happened, mister eh... Goedbloed. Gabriel Goedbloed. Goedbloed? By the way, have you got a driver's licence? Carlos, take it easy. Nothing happened. Mr. Union himself. Is this guy a new party member, perhaps? Stupid people can only ask stupid questions. We will meet again, Mr Zarius. Who's that? - An artist. Hello. I am very sorry. I am in a hurry. I am a painter. They are waiting for me. I hope you're a better painter than motordriver Mr. Goedbloed. Ah, a painter. That's what he says. - The children are very upset because of you. You came and ruined everything. Darling, calm down. See you later. We are an easygoing people, Goedbloed. But if necessary we can be mean motherfuckers. The dignitaries are waiting for you. So you better hurry. Grand entrance, Gabriel, bravo. Hurry up. They are about to leave. Sorry Zarius. I'm sorry. Now hurry. This really is most interesting, Mr. Goedbloed. Eccentric. Those Antillean elements, combined with Western technique. What do you think, darling? Well, technically not bad... ...but a Madonna against an ..Antillean background... ...doesn't seem historically right. Indeed... a point of discussion. Fidelius, did you know about this? What a narrow-minded point of view, Monseigneur. I thought the church would surely respect artistic freedom. Art is freedom. I think. Mrs. van Hanschot, that where church matters are concerned... ...I may be considered an authority. Yes but, Monseigneur, I mean that... Look, the essence of the holy virgin... ...has nothing to do with time or place. And I think, Fidelius... ...that I have already granted you too much freedom in this matter. Mr. Goedbloed, technically the work is quite sufficient... ...but we'll have to talk about it. Louise, shall we go? Monseigneur. Mr. Goedbloed. Your Excellency, I will walk with you. Fidelius, we'll talk about this matter. Mr. Goedbloed. I think your work is of remarkable quality. Not typically Dutch, if I may say so. You studied in The Hague? Yes, your Excellency, eh... Mrs. Hanschot, yes. My private collection will surely interest you. Louise? Yes, I'm coming. Mr. Goedbloed. Remember, if you have problems at home... . ..you can always come to me. Don't forget. Please wait for me. How was your day? What will the sisters think, Carlos? Let the sisters continue praying, dear. If you like something spicy, in any color you want... ...you will be addicted some day to rum and coke. Sweetie, pray for me too, okay? I would commit every sin in the world for you, doll. Show some respect Luciano. That's Mrs. Arlina's daughter. Nurse, nurse, I'm having a heart attack. Help me. I'll send the Garbage Department for you. They will take care of you. What to do with this saucy pussycat... ...because from this pussycat I can expect anything... Neighbors, this pussycat's driving me insane... ...come and help me drown her in the sea. Did you hear Juanita is having an affair? ...with a Portuguese man from Madeira? Before she knows she will be pulling the plow! Ava, Farida, how are you? Hello Yuja, everything okay? Did you hear about the fight between Mr. Union... ...and Mr. Bonheer yesterday evening? Gee, they were really carrying on.... Scandalous... But what happened? One was calling the other a backward ox... ...the other answered with slavekeeper and then... bang! Our queen should have left things as they were. Voting and all that is nothing for us. So we're not allowed to make progress? Come on Farida. You look like a donkey yourself. Pride will have a fall. You insult the ideas and the memory of the man burried here. He was respected by everyone. Brandsma was a God-fearing man. Indeed Monseigneur, a very God-fearing man... ...as far as the eye reaches. His wife and his cbildren know him as a tyrant and a miser. He was very generous towards the church. That's exactly what I mean. My apologies, Mother Superior, Mr. Goedbloed, for keeping you waiting. We had to see Brandsma to his last resting place. Let's get to the point. The Antillean Madonna of Santa Ana church. Is this necessary, young man? Monseigneur, I believe that in the church... ...the Black Madonna has already existed for a long time. The Madonna of Montserrat... of Poland. The Curacao people... I don't doubt your good intentions, Mr. Goedbloed. And I am also informed about the black Madonnas in our history... ...but the White Mary is a tradition of our Holy Mother Church. But Monseigneur, time defines tradition does it not? And, Mother Superior, what do you think? Yes, an Antillean Mary? She wasn't really brown-skinned, was she? No, I don't know. This matter is secularised and politicized in such a way... ...that I have serious doubts. And the Governor is far from happy with the way things are going. But his wife, she... Mother Superior. Mr. Goedbloed. Father Fidelius. Mama, what is this? Those are Dutch matters, my dear. How is your husband. He is still out of a job. Life is hard. - Yes, trust the Lord. Fidelius should hurry. We cannot arrive too late. Here you are, praise the Lord. I'm coming. Listen Filomena, don't give more than six breads. Allright Father. How are you Anita? - Fine, and you Father? I haven't seen Guillermo lately. He shot the Cuban moon. He left for Cuba? That is far away, isn't it? That's what they say, Father Fidelius. Goodmorning, goodmorning. Goodmorning Father. Goodmorning. What's this. You want to break down my door? Off with you. Mr. Francois - How are you, Madam. Hello, Mr. Goedbloed. Come in. You look real sweet. Some lucky people don't age at all. Juanita, the turkey is all set to go to church. A she does is boast that she received another letter... ...from her white Dutch captain. Captain? My ass. Just a fatso sailor, smelling of rum all the time. A drunk. Why doesn't Father ask one of the sisters? They are nearer to God than my little Ava. Please mama. Don't exaggerate. I am not your little Ava. I can decide for myself. Keep your mouth shut while your mother is talking. No one asked you to speak. But Mrs. Arlina, Mother Superior Bernadette herself... ...had given permission. Mother Superior? In my opinion it isn't up to Mother Superior to give... ...permission in this matter. Mama, please stop that. Bishop Hilderbrand himself has requested your operation. Bishop Hildebrand? - Yes. Being a good Catholic I want to collaborate of course... ...and the Bishop is a righteous man. I don't want to oppose him. Yes. Mama is a very good Catholic. Father Fidelius would you like to bless our Saints? We'll talk about this later, you hear, dearest? Mama, come over here, have a look. I have been busy with a first sketch for the mural. But, that's me! Do you like it? Yes, but why should I still model for you, while you... Because of the details, the purity of your jawline... ...the light upon your skin and your eyes that... Alright, I don't want to be impolite, but I have to get back to work. Gabriel, please can you join me? We still have to make a list of everything you need. Mrs. Arlina, thank you very much. Mrs. Arlina? - Father Fidelius. I think that I give my permission. Thank you very much. But Father Fidelius, I keep you personally responsible for this. Father Fidelius you understand me, don't you? Yes, yes. Have a nice day. - I wish you all the best... All the best Mr. Francois. Mr. Goedbloed, I've heard that you are serious. I can see that you can paint. We will try, yes? You know, we are a little different here than in Surinam. So be careful, yes? Yes, Madam, I understand very well. Thank you, Madam. Miss Recordina, I will be seeing you. Good afternoon, Madam. Goodbye Mr. Goedbloed. So and now it's your turn, dear. Child! I'm fine. You know why? That Surinam painter came to our place... ...to ask if I wanted to pose for him. As the Virgin Mary. Surinam painter? Aunt Clysia, how are you? Hello, aunt Anna. The Virgin Mary? Are you sure? But it's impossible with your complexion. He is pulling your leg. Mary has my kind of color. I wouldn't say that. He wants a Mary from here. From here? Born in the Sebastopol street? And her mother is Mrs. Arlina Recordina... ...and her father a marine? That means that God the Father turns out to be Dutch in the end. I should have known! Listen, keep my father out of this. I'm not saying anything about how your father is fooling around. Oh, I am just joking. If you want to pose for him, do it. I'm going to ask him if he wants to paint me... ...in my Rita Hayworth-dress. I would do it for sure. I don't know. You know, I respect Carlos... ...and I don't want to give him any more problems. Then don't come and ask me. Do as you like. If Carlos is that important to you, I stay out of it. Give you rmother my regards. Ava, I'll be seeing you. I have a date with Cary Grant, my dear. Maurice, hello, how are you? And how are you, Isabella? - Oh, I'm alright, thank you dearie. And how is Elvira? - How is Francois. My little playmates. Is that a tattoo from Guyane? Many of you have fled from Devil's island to Surinam. But I wasn't guilty. Love is sometimes too... They think we are not men anymore. In the war it wasn't only the Jews. I know. Maurice? You know what is so funny. Even after the war the Dutch still call me Zwarte Piet. Zwarte Piet? Pierrot noir... ...or sometimes Yankee doodle dandy... ...and I can't even dance. - Shall I teach you? What is this? Don't you never ever touch it. You hear? Tell him that he can pack his bags today! I wan't tolerate people in my house who do these kind of things. Yes, I mean you. Mail from Holland, mail from Holland. Funny people. The weather is good. The sun is shining. My sister is blond. Ot sits on the goat. Mother is at home. Leliska, pay attention. Well, hello, Mr. Zarius, how are you? Good afternoon, Mrs. Arlina. How are you? Carlos. Welcome Zarius. The damned whitie. I cannot paint this way. Ava, dear. Carlos? You are sulking? Everybody keeps asking me how, could I ever give permission for you... ...to be this mans model. Mr. Goedbloed is a sensitive and dedicated artist. Sensitive and dedicated. He should teach you some respect for your mother. I pray that "Yemaya" will protect you. I can see that this man has a bad influence on you. If you continue like this, you will loose Carlos Zarius. Such a good match. And the trouble he had to go through. What trouble? With that stupid family of his? They only care about color and position. You did not raise me to kiss anyone's ass. Shut up. I did everything for you... and your father. My father, a stupid Dutchman, who left you pregnant... ...and who never did a damn thing for me. He loves you, really he loves you. Come to me. My leg is asleep. It itches. Wait a moment, I will help you. It should be blue. The color should be blue. The blue of the sea with the white of the innocent soul. I don't think we sell anything you want, Madam. So my money is not good enough? And this coming from you Mrs. Scrooge? I rather die hungry than accept your money. Aha. We shall see. Just you wait. You are threatening me in my own shop? Get out of here, before I call the police. Scarecrow. We shall meet again, Lina. Oh, Mr. Carlos, just in time. Where is Ava. I came to fetch her. Don't we say hello first? Awyway, you are much too early. Let me tell you that this damn thing has to stop. Ava is not modelling anymore. Painter, Priest or Bishop, they can drop dead. Ava is my woman. If you cannot behave, you better wait outside. You, over there, fetch Maurice... ...and tell him to call Ava for this roaring lion. I am not a maid, I am a designer. She throws everybody out without me even using my powers. Or did I...? Even a policeman can be a suckold. Ava. Carlos is waiting for you. And he is in a terrible mood. I would go if I were you. What's the matter Ava? Carlos thinks his future wife has been a model long enough. Goodbye, Mr. Goedbloed. If I were you I would look for another Mary... ...this one is getting married! Quiet, quiet. The resemblance is amazing already. And if you need a tailor's dummy... ....just ask Maurice for one. I'll talk with Ava. See you, my Prince. Behave, my love. Mrs. Arlina's daughter is here. Oh yes. Thank you. I'm coming. Look at that. Ava... ...I give you this ring because I love you so very much... ...that I don't know what to do with myself anymore. But Carlos... This painting of Mary... ...seems to get the local community quite excited. I wouldn't say so. Our party is very happy with a colored Mary. These discussions about this Mary painting annoy me. I'm sorry Mr. Goedbloed... ...but I forbid you to say anything about the subject. In the end I have much more to offer than the Holy Virgin. And you think yourself a kind of hero by inciting those peasants... ...and blinding them with false promises. They have their rights. Just like the Protestants,... ...the Jews and the Dutch on this island. Mr. Goedbloed? Do you care to join me... ...so I can show you my collection of paintings? And Mr. Goedbloed? This is very interesting. You are very fascinated by blacks, aren't you? Yes, the primitive passion... ...the darkness, the physicality. I would like to paint your portrait. Me, why? Not as the Holy Virgin, I hope. I think Mary Magdalena is more appropriate. Pieter, Mr. Goedbloed is goking to paint my portrait. Does your husband know about this? You are being impertinent, Pieter. Well, you can drop in during office hours, Mr. Goedbloed. We will arrange it there. I want it to be done this evening, Pieter. Mr. Goedbloed, if you would follow. Mr. Knippenveld, he will do it right now. Ava, I saw a weddingdress! Gorgeous! See-through lace and many pleats. I'm sure Maurice can copy it in no time. Ava, Mrs. Recordina,... ...I hope you and your mother... ...will hold in esteem the name of the family. We, descendants of the great Philipus Zarius... ...benefactor of Curacao, may he rest in peace. I wish you both much happiness. Oh Carlos, my child, why/ This will be the death of me. Mama shouldn't say things like that. Wait for me. Ava. Listen, please. No, I don't accept this. Please try to understand. - Leave me alone. Aren't you going outside? Thank you, gentlemen. But Arlina, give your daughter a chance! Thank you, Elvira. You can go now. Good evening, Elvira. How kind of you to solve it in this way. Car accident... ...fight about the chauffeur... That's not the way I see you. To our ancestors. To our muse. No thank you, I never drink while working. Mr. Union, come and have a look. What is this? I'll teach them. We'll get back at them. Look at this, Mieke. Relax Alex. But this is impossible. - It will be alright. Would you like a cup of tea? I gave permission, but I didn't expect this from you. Ava, psst, come over here. Hello Maurice, you need me? I come with love from Gabriel. Gabriel wants to paint you only once more. No, problems, problems, too many problems. Father Fidelius, you should stop this immediately. From the moment this Surinam painter arrived... ...I knew we were heading towards a catastrophe. What does being Surinamese have to do with it? I think he is a very good painter. Listen, Mimi, you nearly broke your neck to graduate from high school. You are impossible. open your hearts. Color doesn't change the value... ...of the sacred symbol of the Holy Virgin. The painted gave Mary the face of Curacao. A sign. God has given us a sign. Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women... ...and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners,... ...now and at the hours of our death. Amen. Stop behaving like fools. Ava is no saint. There's nothing saintly about her. But Mrs. Arlina, I was there myself! I saw with these eyes,... ...that one day will be eaten by worms. ...how the Virgin cried and trembled. Mrs. Arline, my father has a terrible rash. Can't Ava come and pray for him? Stay away from me! Mrs. Arlina. I can't pay my rent. What in heaven do you want me to do, Jacob! This is getting out of hand. Where is Ava? I'm going to get her. This foolishness must end at once. The child hides in her room... ...because these people bother and pester her. Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Look here. Did you hear that? Flesh and blood like everybody else. This is no saint, you're looking at. I am Ava Recordina. I am not the Virgin. I have nothing to do with this. Leave me alone. She is crying just like the Virgin. Exactly like her. And now I've had it. Go away. Don't you see how distressed she is? How nervous you make her? I'm not leaving from here, no way. Well, anyone who dares to mention the word miracle,... I'll personally give a few miraculous blows. This absolute farce! This total disgrace of the church! I want you out of the parish, off this island. The sooner, the better! Monseigneur Hildebrand, please let us not load everything... ...upon Father Fidelius's shoulder. But especially for Ava Recordina this is very inconvenient. Inconvenient is an euphemism, Mother Superior. We do everything we can to teach these people to be realistic. ...and Father Fidelius just stands there... ...allowing a fake-miracle to happen! This is absurd! Monseigneur. I was more or less overcome by it myself. Don't you see where all this leads to I think that if you still want to serve the church,... ...you should use the little intelligence you still have left. My church doesn't need your kind of revolution! Monseigneur, what harm is there in a colored world. In a colored Madonna, or even in a colored heaven. This is reality! And if one needs a fake-miracle to accompolish this, let it be so! You are a priest. And that ought to be sufficient for you. Go! Those bastards, my Goddamned motorcycle. I'll kill them. This is brutality, do you understand this? You wear something that works against you. Give it to me. Go home... You... you... You... you are stupid, very stupid. Imbecile! This will make you feel better. Gabriel go away from here. Go away. Take a bath with these seven essences I prepared for you. Use these powders too. Rub some of this perfume in the palm of your hand. Then, embrace him spontaneously. Yes, but I can't suddenly become too intimate with him. Don't forget to wear blue. For one week. Without faith you won't succeed. You have to concentrate all your energy on this. Take care of yourself. And go in the name of the Lord our God. And may Saint John the Conqueror help you to conquer this man. Put your donation in there. He sucked on it. Suck, Gibi, suck. When night time falls to have some fun,... ...evil spirits are on the run. Ghosts floating around desperately. Cactus thorns swaying angrily. Ten iguanas spitting out drunken rhyme. My eyes turn around with the teeth in my mouth. A leap between the rat and the trap to save me in time... Mister painter. Look at that girl. Isn't that the girl of whom they say that she is a Saint? I saw her picture in the paper. She can surely work a miracle for me. What a saucy dish! Dearie, let mommie take care of you. Good afternoon ladies, see you soon. Are we working or having a tea party? Good afternoon, please come in. This is beautiful. - Thank you Maurice, thank you. Long live the Queen, long live the cash register! Can't you dress decently when you enter our shop? Is that material paid for? I thought you yourself gave it to him in the storage room. Oh Carolina, my dear. I came to visit Louise. But those men... I'm sorry, Mr. Goedbloed, but this is according to protocol. You arrive here unnoticed. Quite unusual. And on top of that one is supposed to be appropriately dressed. Especially on a day like this. But Sir, I only want to offer it to her personally. This painting... ...is no Edam cheese. That we appreciate art, Mr. Goedbloed, one can see. This is a sketch Toorop made of Princess Emma. An excellent Dutch painter. Indonesia has always inspired him. I will take care that... ...Mrs. Van Hanschot will personally receive the painting. That is all, Mr. Goedbloed. You can leave now. Who handed you this painting? - Goedbloed. He was damned unmannered. Your Excellency, I took the liberty of sending him away. What do you mean "unmannered"? Correctly done. I have no need for irregularities today. Louise leave that painting in peace. We are being expected on the balcony. Long live the Queen, hip, hip, hurray. That shirt, was that necessary? Is there something between the two of you? Damn it, don't be such a bore, you with your jealousy. Good morning Miss Ava. Francois, how are you? Oh Maurice, my brown sugardoll. Who are these bastards? I bet they are faggots. Get lost, dirty old faggot. Fucking hell. Damn it. You are very close together, aren't you, Mr. Francois? Do I know you, Sir? You damn well don't have to know me. What's the matter, Francois? Nothing. What do they mean, goddamn it. Go to hell, because they have money they think they can do everything. They have ruined my motorcycle! Oh yes? - Yes. I think you should better leave for Holland. I'm not quite finished with Curacao. I'm staying. As you like. I'm going home because I'm tired. Ava, listen to me. It's me, the angel Gabriel. Especially you, you in particular should stop with this nonsense. All those people who want something from me. I can't breathe. Damn it, bastard. Ava, I'm sorry. What do you want from me? I saw you rising out of the sea. A Goddess. The sun and the moon were fighting for you. You were dancing on the water. Dazzling. Naked. I have already made a sketch of the painting. I have to continue. So I really have to paint you, Ava. You are stark raving mad. If you pose, I will never ever ask you for anything anymore... Ah, so you are finally starting to use your brains. Ave, Ava Recordina, Ave. Oh Good Lord... A sea Goddess... You lost this round, this time around. - Yes. This will brighten you up a little. What's the matter with you these days? Pieter was talking about Indonesia. A massacre between the Dutch and... O dear, is your colored blood starting to trouble you? Pay attention. Mother Superior. Did you by any chance see Ava? She didn't feel well. Nothing serious though. Just a case of fatigue. How cute you look. Really folkloristic. Now you finally are where you want to be, aren't you? Where did you get that for heavens' sake. From Louise. I don't want you to wear it. Give it back immediately. Never ever. Ladies and gentlemen, we would have liked the painter himself... ...to unveil his painting. But he regrets he is unable to come today... ...so my husband will do it. Esteemed guests... It gives me much pleasure to unveil the latest acquisition... ...for my wife's private collection. Horrible. This really is too much. I told you. This way he harms our business. Music! You are very late with your accusation. But I cannot possibly ignore this one. This brutal, arrogant ape doesn't only cause a scandal,... ...he also insults the Dutch government. Knippenveld, arrest the idiot. Treat this case as it should... ...by which I mean: discretely. You can count on me. Your Excellency. Pieter, are you sure that... - Enough scandals for today. Has everybody gone mad on this goddamn island! Damn it. Dirty faggot. I fucked you! And, which Goddess may this be... Open up, come help me. Maurice... Isn't that Ava Recordina? Mrs. Arlina? - I have already got some. Carlos? - Thank you, Farida. Ava. Good evening. Did you have a good day? And where do you come from at this time of night, young lady? But mama... If you want to behave like a slut,... ...do keep some respect for your mother. What happened? Where were you? We were very worried. Maurice... They have beaten up Maurice. So, now it's Maurice? What has happened? - I don't know. They carried him into La Moda de Paris... ...and he was covered in blood. So you were visiting your beloved painter? Were you in his studio? Ava? Look at me. What the hell were you doing up there? No. Nobody hits my daughter. And if there is hitting to be done, I will do it myself. I'll break his neck. If you had raised your daughter properly,... ...this wouldn't have happened. But mama. - What has happened? Mama, they have put a spell on us! What does all this mean? I don't know, but we will find out soon enough. I want to kill them, the bastards. Goedbloed, you'll have to leave tomorrow. I won't stay much longer. What's going on here? I've had enough of this! - No, no! Take him away. No. Why! What a disgrace. Bastard. Just look. Slut. People, look what our friend the painter, really had in mind. He came to corrupt our women. Our Virgin has arrived. What happened? Whore. Slut. Explain to me, why! Why! Why. Why...? Take this man away for interrogation.
