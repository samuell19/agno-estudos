"WHIRLY GIRL" Hey -What did I tell you? -What did you tell me? -There is a God and she dances. -The Whirlygirl cometh -and so do I. Saturday, two -Don't do it -It took me all year to get this response. -Four guys were expelled from Kent. Three from Salisbury., -Which is why I need your help.. -Anyone else and they'll screw it up.. -Raoul, smuggling a dancer...... -She's not a dancer... I have two words to describe the performance she gives: hard on. Hard-on is one word, hyphenated. Dumb idea is two words and smuggling a Whirlygirl into campus in the middle of the night... -is suicide. -We'll use the old water tower. Nobody's been down there in years. It's perfect. -She is perfect. She'll change your life. -My life's fine. I called a meeting with the rest of the guys. -Will you at least be there? -Come on! -What exactly does she do? -We don't really know. We don't know if she's 40 or 15. A nymphomaniac or a virgin. -40 or 15 is a big difference, though. -Look, for 2 years she's been secretly going to boys' schools and blowing their minds. I've heard she's unreal. My cousin saw her at Hillbrook and freaked out. He couldn't stop whacking it for 2 weeks. -She's worshiped. We have to go through with this. -It's true. For those of you with the guts to live... ...this is the closest you'll ever get to touching, seeing, smelling perfection. So I call upon my roommate, Mr. James Edwards... to help us figure out what it'll take for the rest of us morons to pull this madness off. - Freddie, are you in? - It's been a desperate winter, my man. - It's been a desperate winter, my man. If I have to watch another heifer stagger off a bus from Mount Ugly for one of our dances... No, no, I'm going to kill myself. -Would we be expelled? -Not we. You. All you, guys. -We'd be more than expelled, baby, we'll be immortalized. -Look, guys, if you get caught, you're dead. Was I not there for you every miserable minute when your British ass first came to Walden? At least help us pull this off so you don't have to graduate by yourself. -Why me? -Because you're the detail man. Because you think two moves ahead. Because you're man enough to not lead with your dick. -You're our only hope -Okay. I'll help. But I'm not going. -Let's go. -Man, I hate spiders. Okay, listen up, guys. As soon as she gets here she wants the music to kick in as loud as you can get away with. - Freddie? That's yours. - Got you. She needs a detailed map. How to get in and how to get out without getting caught. Any hitch, she's off with the money, no show. It's all got to run smoothly. We have to control the sensor lights, the alarm systems and keep the security guard distracted. -Eddie? That's all yours. -Check There's a lot to clear up by Saturday. -And as for the dance.David, give her your best light show. -Sure. Anchors-away! Big Clive, you're going to have to pull enough electricity from outside. No juice, no dance. Soundproofing is vital. Anyone hears you, you're dead. Make sure to check the levels at night when the temperature drops. Sound refracts differently. Everything is louder. -As for drugs, forget about it. Zero tolerance. You'll all be kicked out. -David! Someone's got to get into town to get the beer without being seen. Be careful with I.D. I suggest Freddie and Raoul. -McTavish! -Oh! Oh, shit! And in the end, if you're diligent, careful and a little bit clever... all 3 being highly unlikely you might just pull this off. - I had a meeting with the Stanford Rep. - Do tell. He said I have a great shot at a full scholarship. Imagine your dad right now. He'd be so proud of you. -It's all he really ever wanted. -We all coming together here. -You be careful. -Mom, I'm stuck in a boys' school in the middle of nowhere. There's nothing to be careful from. - You're all I've got. -Listen, mom, I should go before the phones are cut off. -I love you. -I love you too, mom. -Bye, love. -Bye. Yeah? -You don't have to go. -reunion I'll still be the same... genius-virgin-nerd-loser-bassoon player I am now. That's all part of your charm. If we get caught, just tell my parents I love them and I'm really, really sorry. -Chief, what's wrong? -You've come so far, I can't let you hang yourself now. - You okay here waiting alone? -I'll be the first one to lay eyes on her. The bitch stood us up. That's it. I want my fucking money back. 20 bucks? Yeah. Your dad owns Michigan for Chrissake. Guys, we should pack it in soon. McTavish gets up at 5 for his run. She's coming! Freddie? Dave? -O-o0... o-o-oll! Freddie? Dave? - She's the Whirlygirl, a kiss doesn't mean shit. - Oh, James kissed back. - And she didn't even flinch. - No, no, no. She countered the force with an equal and opposite reaction, probably creating some unseen chemical bond. - Get your head out of your ass. - Learn some physics. Raoul, come on, my man. Give us the higher truth. Why did he get the kiss? Because he's the only one of us who isn't a total pig. Or she liked his accent. But either way it comes down to the eternal question... What did you feel in here, man? Hey, I'm just trying to get us back to normal before... What's wrong? -Jimmy? -Oh, shit! -What? -She stole my watch. -She what? -My watch. My dad's watch. -I'm telling you, she never answers. -I can't waste time like this. -Freddie, will you get Eddie in? - Yeah. Yeah. ...both knew the repercussions for smoking in their dorms for the second time. Walden is not a nursery. Walden is a privilege. Let us pray. Bless, oh, Lord this school with thy abiding grace. Let thy fatherly hand be stretched over it and each of us. So that the love of learning may here flourish and abound. Bless those who teach and those who learn. Give to the weak encouragement. To the strong compassion. And to all peace, hope and tranquility. We ask this for thy mercy sake. Amen. -Any luck? -The number belongs to a guy named Ernest Murphy. He's a cab driver. I got his I.D. number and I and I phoned the company he works for. -Yeah, what did they say? -They never heard of him. -So now what? -I'll go there and find the guy if I have to. -Where's the place? The city. New York. New York? Actually, it' in Queens, Mr. McTavish. - You've never even been to the city. - No, but I've laid out the - I was thinking Saturday, be back by curfew. - Are you're sure she - I want to see her face- to-face, then I'll know. - And you can't tell me where you met her? -I'd rather not. - Call me before you get back on the train, okay? - Thanks, sir. - Curfew's at 11! Man, I'm sorry. - I'm looking for Ernest Murphy. - There's no one here named Ernest Murphy. - You sure? - No, I'm dazed and confused. It's just that the police traced his cell phone to here. I have his cab number. - What's the number? - LRDNY373 Spider Murphy. Spider. No one calls him Ernest. -Is he in today? -He's on the street. And he owns the cab so he doesn't have to come back in, probably won't,either. -I'll sit here and wait.? -Give it to me straight. He owes you money? -I'm looking for a person we both know. Suit yourself. There's a seat outside. -I have nothing to say. -I have to find her. -Take a number. You won't even tell me why. You're the only number I've got. The police said... Hey, don't threaten me. The police ain't going to tell you shit. -Tell me why do you want to see her. -I think she took something of mine. -Can't help you. -Look, I really have to find her. -I've driven her to a few gigs. She tips good. She paid me a few bucks to take messages for her on my cell, that's it. -Okay, here's the deal. -Shut up and keep your head between your legs. -What for? -You can't know where she lives. And you talk too much. Head down. -It's down. Good. And I'll ask her about the watch. -Okay, but... I have to see her eyes. -What, you're giving me orders? -Man, keep your goddamn head down. Are we there? - Is that some sort of signal? - Keep your head down. - Hey! What are you doing here? - What? No hello? - What are you doing here? - A little business. There's a kid in the back seat who wants to ask you a question. - Is he sick? - He wants to know if you... -No! Don't say it! -Man, get your ass back in the car. - No, I told you I need to see her eyes. - What the fuck is going on? - Get in the car! - I need to know if you stole my watch. - I don't even know whoyou are. - Man, get in the goddamn car! -I'm the guy from Walden Academy. Last weekend. -You drove all the way from Walden.. -...to ask me about a watch? -Well, it disappeared when you kissed me. - I don't know anything about it. - Right. You heard her. Now get in the cab. No, I'm sorry, I'm not going until I'm sure. I'm not sure. -Well, I'm sure. -Well, I want my watch back. -I didn't take your watch. Can I check your place then, just for my own peace of mind? - You have to be kidding me! - Okay, that's it. She answered your question. Spider, it's okay. It's okay. Forget it. Let's get out of here. Mr. Gargani 1825 Bayside Avenue Queens, NY 11373 -Oh, shit! Alice! Open up! I know you're in there. Do you hear me? Damn you, Alice, you have one last chance... ...or what I saved you from will befall you! I asked you to come to me as you should have! But you didn't! You're making a big mistake! Alicelll You think I like this? You brought this on yourself! You best call or your very own Armageddon... ...iIs coming and Hell is no amusement park! Jesus! What the hell are you doing in here? You know, I almost never lie. It's an old habit. That's all. I felt the watch and the next thing I knew it was in my hand. What does the inscription mean anyway? -Nothing you'd understand. -It's not exactly a Rolex, okay? It was my dad's. He'd give it to me before he'd go away for work on weekends. He'd say before the little hand gets to the eight on Sunday evening, I'll be back. One night he fell asleep at the wheel and he didn't come back. So it might not be a Rolex to you, but it's a Rolex to me. I'm sorry. -You look a little frazzled. -Yeah, it's been one hell of an afternoon. I broke your neighbor's window by mistake. Well, I can't speak for him, but, I don't care. -Are you hungry? -I have a curfew. -What time do you have to be back? -There was a guy outside your window in a soldier's uniform, -threatening you. -Monty.... -Doesn't know if he wants to love me -or kill me. -He said if he doesn't hear from you, what he saved you from will be fall you. - He didn't see you, did he? - No. - Good. Did he save you from something? I really have to eat. I'm starving. You're hungry, right? So, just give me a second. - Anything else? - No, thanks. -I'm just saying, if your mom's dying, you should go and see her. -Can we talk about something else? She sent you a letter. 3 months to live. She clearly wants to see you. God, I wish you'd shown this much comph when I was dancing. -l told you, I thought the dance was terrific. -Let me imitate your response. Well, I just... My friends say I react to things a little differently than most. Like someone without a nervous system? They say I... Raoul says I don't lead with my dick. -Yeah.... -What? Nothing. It's a good theory, but it won't hold up. I just don't think that you've ever been laid properly. That's not something I choose to discuss. If I asked you to stay tonight, -I think you'd risk everything. -- No, I wouldn't. -James, don't do this to yourself. -Alice, you're amazing. Really. But nothing, okay, an act of God, maybe... But nothing would make me break my commitments. -An act of God? -Yeah.... An earthquake. A car accident. Heart attack. -An act of God? That's it? -Yeah, that's it. -Do you have any money? -No. Did I offend you? -No, - Do you have money? -No, I... I gave it to the cab driver. -I thought this was on you. -See, I just don't plan that far ahead. So, what should we do now? Hurry up! Come on! Hurry! Excuse me! Get back here. Shit! -You're turning me into a criminal by association! - Bullshit! You broke into my apartment! - Yeah, you're a bad influence. - Pull over if you see a phone, I have to call my advisor. - Your advisor? - Just pull over if you see a phone. I said I'd call him before I got on the train. - I just try to do what's right. That's all. - That is so arousing. - You should give it a go sometime. - I'll give it a go. -l try... to do... what's right... -Yeah. Ha ha. Ha ha. Just give me a second. -What are you doing? -I'm not doing anything. -Is there something you want me to do? - Yeah. Keep it down. - You keep it down. - I'm being serious. Collect call, please, from James Edwards. Hi. Mr. McTavish, it's James. I'm fine. I'm, min... I'm in Queens. Yeah, yeah, everything is... No, it's, it's, it's great. The... the connection isn't great. The watch? Yeah, I... God, I found the woman... ...but the watch, we have to go and get the watch. I just... I don't think I'm going to be able to make it back for curfew. Could I call you later or should I...? Do... do I have a place to stay? Yes... yeah. I... Thanks a lot, sir. Bye-bye. What are you doing? Playing God. Alice... -I needed to see you. -Roger! -It's been 3 months. -I don't believe this. -l tried. I really did. - Is everything okay? - Just get dressed. - Give me the key. - I would have called. - I told you I'd pay for a phone. - I don't want a phone. Why can't I see you? I'll pay your rent. I could get you moved again. - I don't want your help anymore. - I needed to see you before I left. - I'm taking the family to Florida on vacation. - Great. How are the wife and kids? I'm trying to make it work, but I miss you. Stick with the counseling. -Can I see you when I come back? -Just go. Please. - Get your stuff and get out. - Me? Wait a sec. Who the hell was that? - I never promised you anything. - I never said you did. It was still a great night. - Are you still here? - Yes I am! - What do you mean sugar daddy? - What part of the sentence didn't you get? - Did you have sex with him? - I was 16 with no roof over my head. - Last night was beautiful. - Last night was sex. You got your watch. We're even. That's it. - That's not it. - Yes, that's it! -Alice! - Go back to your life! - At least I got a life! -What do I do now? -Let's face it, if it wasn't over, she'd eventually drive you to suicide. Or worse, chronic masturbation. Come on, Chief. Broken family, sugar daddy, ...stalker. At least tell me about the sex. Okay. If you're not going to talk, me and my buddies will re-enact it. Oh, Whirlygirl, I know this can't be, this tragic love, but I love you. -No, I'm a dirty rat, see? Go back to Walden, see? I can't be loved, see? -But Whirlygirl, I can change you. I can save you with my middle class family values and solid work ethic. Okay, enough already! And her name's Alice. She's lucky to even have a shot at you. Yeah? -James, phone. -Mom again? Tell her not to call so late. I need my beauty sleep. That picture's important to me. And I really never thought someone like you would take it. What picture? - Alice, I didn't mean to take that. - You didn't mean to? -No, I... You know what? You can keep it. - It was good for me to see what kind of guy you are. - That's not the sort of guy I am. I was mad. Hello? Alice? - Why don't you just send it to her? - I never got her actual address. - Well, then call her. - She doesn't have a phone. -Why did you take it anyway? -I was upset. And by the time I wished I hadn't, I'd forgotten. - And that's it? You just want to give it back to her? - Yeah, I just want to give her back and say good-bye. David and Freddie are going home for the weekend. See if you can stay with one of them. That's it for the semester. And James? Be in touch. Alice? Excuse me! Let's take it from the top. Quicker from the beginning. Just let's go again from the top. Okay. - So where was the picture taken? - Rockefeller Center. -We had just gone skating. We were happy. - Did you skate a lot? - Some. - Many kids back home skated, but my dad didn't want me to. - How old were you? - 14. - But, you cut out the picture. - It's a picture of me and my mom. -Yeah, but... -Would you stop asking me so many questions? - Christ. - What? - I know what you want from me. - Hey, I just asked you about your week. If that's not what you want why don't you push me away? My week was fabulous! No Monty. No Roger. I got offered a grand to dance at a Fraternity! - A grand and I turned them down! - Why? They phoned back and guess what? They doubled it. 2,000 dollars! So I am happy. I'm thrilled! I'm ecstatic! Shit. YOUR TIME IS UP IT'S NOT JUST A JOB, IT'S AN AVENTURE Monty! - I think you should call the police. - Yeah, been there, done that. Still waiting. Fuck. Fuck! - Where are you going? - I'm going to get my stuff back. - You can't go near that guy. - What are you going to do about it? - I don't know. What do you want me to do? - You showed up. I don't care what you do. It's all my personal stuff. Most importantly a letter from my mother. -for Chrissakes, what kind of men are protecting this country? -Watch yourself, young lady. - No, I'm sorry. He's been stalking me for 2 months now. -He knows where I live, what I'm doing, where I'm going, where I've been. -Any witnesses? -I just want the letter back, okay? It's from my mother. -What do you expect me to do? Ask him to spell adventure. Describe your relationship with this woman? From our brief time together, Sir, all I know is she's a con woman and a liar. I have no knowledge of her belongings. - Private Greeber... - Sir? - Spell adventure. - Sir? -You can't threaten me! -We didn't threat you, we just proved you're an idiot! Soon enough you'll be mine the way you like it! And you, preppy! You defile her and I'll rip out your fucking entrails! By the way, I threw all your shit in the East River where it belongs! So that's why you left home. How could your mom not believe you? I said, Mom, the guy that you're in love with, is loving me too. I guess that would be hard for anyone to take. I don't know what to say. It's not that bad. I get to dance everyday. I love Walden. And my plans. But what difference do they make? You just seem to try so hard all the time to do the right thing. Haven't you ever just said screw it? And let it all go? Isn't that what I'm doing? - How's it look? - Money. My God. This is wicked. -That's them. -Okay, I'm going to go get ready. You let them in. - Don't touch it! - I'm sorry. - Hey Alice...? Are we... together? -Just a second! - I have to get ready. - But are we? Let your boys in. -He said 301. -Who is it? -You look a little different there. Loose some weight? -Come on, come in. - Bit of a dive, isn't it? - Yeah, you try dancing for a living. Hang on a second. Now, you guys probably think it's funny, but if there's 2 women joining us, that makes 3. But there's 4 of us, and I'm always the odd man out. - Look, I'll sit this one out. -You get a chance to get laid, take it. - Really? -Yeah. And just stop telling everyone you're a bassoon player. Yeah, but I've got to be myself. I think that's the problem. -Where's the beer? -Ready? Twist. Things not only go down, they also go out. So you have to be in charge of both at the same time. You can't really lose track of that little... Anyone else want the hair done? Evan, Marianne, these are Walden's finest. - Freddie. Walden's Picasso. - Sweetheart, stop it! - Raoul, captain of... - What? - His own destiny? - Captain of his own destiny. - And Dave? Christ, it's mine. -I play the bassoon. -It has to be McTavish. Should I get it? - Get it. Get it! - Don't get it! Wait. When I met him, he never lied. Now watch. It's one of the largest reed instruments. Hi, Mr McTavish. Just, just here with the boys. Yeah, no, I have time study on Tuesday and Wednesday. Are you kidding? I know, it's huge. Good. No, I was thinking about study time. Okay. Thanks, sir. We're just going to get a bite to eat. Bye. - Bye, sir. - Bye, sir. - Monty is here! - What? - Monty is here! - Where? - There. - Shit. We got to get out of here. - What about the others? - After you, my darling. - Thank you very much. - Come on. - What are you doing? - Roger lives here? - Is he still out of town? - Yeah. - Would he care if we're here? - I m sure he would. -I've never really seen his family. -So you've been here before? I have, a couple times. I just never noticed it. His daughter is as old as you. She's fatter than me, that's for sure. Do you ever miss your dad? Sometimes. Are those dreamy eyes? What do you want to do with your life? I knew that question was coming. It's a fair question. I told you. I'm getting 2,000 bucks... To dance at some college Frat House. Yeah, you told me. Big time. Well, what more could a girl want... ...big time? You can go and see your mom. -Do you have any real ambitions? -Sure. I'm going to buy an old car... ...and drive somewhere. -Someday maybe I'll get a real job. - Really? - Nah. I know we don't make the most likely couple. I don't dance. You don't play hockey. Maybe if I finished school I could ... I could manage you... Alice... I think I'm falling in love with you... Onnwe... God. God. Alice! Alice! Alice, what did you take? It's okay, I just need to sleep. -Should I call an ambulance? -Only if you think you need one. Sleep. -We've been neighbors for 15 years. He's never mentioned her. -Really? She's asleep, but when she wakes up, I'll let her know you dropped by. So, they spent a lot of time together in Alabama? Every summer. He's not from Alabama. Thanks for the cookies. Alice, wake up! Alice, we have to go. Alice... Alice... The neighbor's going to call the police and we have to split. What are you doing? I'm staying. You go. - What are you talking about? We can't stay. - I don't care. They can come and get me. Alice, I know you're tired. I don't want to get busted. - Will you get up? Please? - I told you to go. Look, as a favor... I'm asking you to come with me. I don't want to leave you...but my ass is on the line. -I don't feel so good. -Okay. What can I do? - Done. Thanks. - Okay, everybody up. Okay, you're ready to go? Okay. But I think I'm going to see my mom. Yeah. I want to see her. Okay. Great. I'll go with you. But then we talk. James, you crazy boy, -there's nothing to talk about. -Yes, Alice, there is. - Shit, cops, Alice! - You really are turning into a criminal, aren't you? - How do I look? - Beautiful. - She's lucky to have a daughter like you. -Is this a moment? Are we sharing a moment? -I don't know. Are we? What if my stepdad's there? I'll pulverize the son-of-a-bitch. He's a big motherfucker. Okay. I'll insult him and run. It'll be okay. - Hi. May I help you? - Yes, I'm looking for my mother, Mary Pearce. Pearce? Are you sure she's on the third floor? Yes, she sent me a letter saying that she was in the Cancer Ward, on the third floor. - Let me check the main directory. P-E-A...? -R-C-E. Could be Pike, maybe. - Yes, Mary Pike? - Yeah. - You're her daughter? - Yeah. -She checked in about 2 months ago. Your father was with her. - He's not my father. - Is she still here? - Please, come with me. I'm sorry, sir, I lost your cell phone but I thought I should phone... Yeah, I think it must have fallen off on the mop-head. A mop-head. Listen, I promise I'll be back for classes in the morning. Highway 1, outside Bridgeport. -Sir, Alice's mom had cancer. We went to the hospital to visit her. -I couldn't have left her. What? - Who is it? - McTavish. - Oh, one second. I'm just changing. I spoke to the headmaster this morning, about a lot of things. He talked to the boys. He knows a little already. Sir, come in. I'm sure in your eyes there are good reasons why you're risking your future for this person. - But you have to understand... - Alice. - What? -I just wanted you to know her name. -If she was worth the trouble, she would have the character or the insight to know the position -But she's not doing that, is she? -She's had a hard time. Well, you've had a hard time too. There are people in this world who, for whatever reasons have so little inside themselves -that all they can do to feel alive... -No! They suck the life out of people... ...who have greatness inside. You have that. Listen to me. -I've seen this before. -Sir, I don't think we should be talking about a person who's not here. - I'm trying to defend you. - I'm aware of the consequences. - I don't think you are. - Yeah, but you know? I am. - Then get your shit together. I hear you. I do. -And I appreciate everything you've done for me. -You've come a long way. Don't blow it all on someone - I have to go. - You what? - I have to go. - What are you talking about? What happened? I just want it to end like this. What are you doing? What's wrong? Who's going to look after you? Alice, please. Don't go. Camus, gentlemen, not Came-us. As for Camus, he was at the opposite end of the philosophy spectrum He believed that society had decayed to such an extent... ...that all modern man had to look forward to, was fornication and reading the newspaper. - Yes, Raoul? - It sounds to me like Camus was onto something. That, gentlemen, is worth a debate. There he is. What's up, dude? So, are you coming to the movies? I know how it is, man. - Women come, women go. - Thanks. Alright. Fair enough. Raoul? Raoul? - Yeah? - I have to go see Alice. No. No, you don't. She's there alone at the fraternity. -It doesn't feel right. -You have to let it go. It's over. Shit. It was good knowing you. Oh, shit! - Good luck, kid. - Thanks for the lift. - Sorry, Jack, private party. - The dancer's my friend. Yeah, sure she is. Look, no invitation, no penetration. Not through my door, alright? Come on. Now I'm going to take what is rightfully mine. Then I'll come down there and deal with you. Let's go Hey, soldier. Welcome home. It's confirmed, by the way. Dave's got gonorrhea. Smartest kid in school and he forgets to wear a condom. They want you for the hearing. Good luck. You have shown utter disrespect for your family for your friends... ...for the school and for the law. Flagrantly violated numerous rules. All the while, you were given support far beyond the call of duty. Mr. Edwards, is there anything you wish to add in your own defense? -No -Thank you, Mr. Edwards, for that heartfelt response. However, in recent weeks your behavior has been beyond explicable. Lying, missing classes... Breaking curfews, auto-theft... - Hi. Sorry. - Excuse me, Miss... -Yeah. I know. -Excuse me, but I'm going to have to ask you to leave. I'm the problem here, okay? I'm the reason why James is here. I am a con woman. I con people out of watches... People have accused me of having nothing inside. Of having no remorse, of using people and.. ..there is truth to that. But this guy that you're kicking out... ...he tried to tell me that my life didn't have to be like this. He tried to wake me up. And I didn't listen, but you should listen to me. -Through a great act of bravery he saved my pointless little life. -Thank you for that spirited confession. You think I'm kidding? He stopped a guy from holding me down and raping me. Can you hold that against anybody? James talks about Walden and his friends and Mc-whatever-his-name-is, with nothing but pride... ...and love. So if a person like me can get off her ass to stand up for him... ...you can take 5 minutes to pull your heads out of your asses and do the same. Give the guy a break. He's better than any of you. That is all I have to say. Actually, it's not everything. I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't stare at my ass on the way out. See?, sometimes you just can't help yourself. Oh, and by the way... ...the guy that's been screwing me and paying for a roof over my head? Walden, Class of '69.. ..and now one of your beloved Trustees. That is all I have to say. What do you think is taking them so long? Probably checking up on old Roger. - I don't know. Ask Dave. - What do I know? I'm 18 and pissing glass. -But, guess what? I wrote her a love letter. -Tell me you didn't! -No, I did. I miss her. You're an idiot! Maybe he found his Whirlygirl. - Yeah, look where it got me. - But she was the original. Hey, guys! Guess what I just heard? Well, the vote came down. You're in. What are you doing here? It's a beauty. - Where did you get it? - Friend of a friend. - So you're back in prison, huh? - Yeah. I was just on my way out of here and I wanted to say hi. - Where are you going? - I don't know. Drive out West somewhere maybe. - Isn't that near Stanford? - It can be. I cleared off the passenger seat for you... ...in case you might want to come. I'm going to finish up here. Remember that speech where I said... "that's all I have to say?" Well, it's not. I don't know about love, but... ...you got to me. You really got to me. So, give me a kiss and I'll be on my way. Wait! Alice! Wait! Here. -I can't take this. -The inscription means faithful and brave. -It's your dad's watch. -Not anymore. Go. Go. I'm going to bring this back to you one day. I promise. I know you will.
