NETFLIX PRESENTS - You're Bavarian? - Yes. And you were christened Ferrero? I'm the last one. - It's loaded, isn't it? - Yes, it's loaded. Point it forward. Good. Shut the flap. - I can't get them off. - What? I can't. - Leave them on. - What? - Leave the shoes on. - And the socks? - Come on. - I have to take them off. - What? - I have to take them off. Bad news. Come inside. Ludwig wanted to get rid of it. You always wanted to learn how to play. Happy? The rooms... We've sold most of the contents on eBay. - Are there documents? - Yes, of course. Do not sell anything from now on. We just thought... We paid the bills with it. No, nothing must be sold until the report is finished. Well, the contract expires at the end of the month. These rooms are still rented in June and July. It's in the folder. Exactly. Here's the kitchen. And you saw these two rooms earlier. This is the financial report for 2014... and 2015. My tax adviser will send you the one for 2016 on Monday. What about the third person, Samuel Bach? We haven't been able to get a hold of him for some weeks now. He renounced ownership in February. Would you like a coffee? Some water? No, thanks. This is all very straightforward. I'll check it all in detail, and then... I have a question. What could we do if we wanted to carry on? You could consider a surrender and set up a new company, as a private corporation. I would sell you the name and the manuscripts and you'd carry on. ALL IS WELL No, we're almost on our way. Yes, I'll do that. All right, Suse... there's somebody I must say hello to. Well, then say hello. Hello. Gosh, you've grown a lot. Yes. Well... What are you doing here? A class reunion. Oh, dear. What else? How are you doing? Okay. I haven't read the new book by Samuel yet. Is it well-reviewed? - Is it good? - Yes, it's good. So good that Ullstein contracted him. Oh, dear. What about you? We've just seen the insolvency administrator. Oh, dear. I have a job. Do you need one? - What it is? - My chief editor is... Sissi, this is Janne. Janne, meet Sissi. She babysat Hendrik and Viktor. Hello. Hi. - You're not coming with us, Martin? - No, I'm just finishing my drink. As reasonable as ever. Tomorrow he's going to the wedding in Tyrol. Drop by tomorrow and let's have a chat. All right. - You'll be in touch. Promise? - Promise. - See you tomorrow. - Bye. - Ciao. - Ciao. Ciao. You look well. You keep talking all the time. We haven't seen each other in a long time. Come on, let's go. We're redecorating the doctor's office. Flori is in charge of the design. He's doing well. Are you back in Munich? We moved to lower Bavaria. My boyfriend's uncle owns a house there. He doesn't use it, so we're rebuilding it. Great. How nice. What about you? I run an agency with my brother for keynote speakers. Give it to me. Impossible. I'm not 18 yet. There's the change. Here are the cigarettes. How do you know Robert? Sissi, my sister. I see. Do you know a Severin Freund? A ski jumper. Why? I see. A classmate had dinner with him. Wow. Is this wow? Severin Freund. Wow! I want to buy this. It costs money, but I have none. II'll just put down two euros. I missed it. Don't go any further. This is the end of the world. This is a dead end. Attention. A cat. And a black one! I can handle it. I can tell. I'm a little scared too. Move on, move on. Nothing to see here. Nothing. We want to go to Robert. Can you help us? I'm exhausted. Come on, you'll sleep on the couch. Is it here? Attention. Secret hideout. Voilà. I need a helmet in here. Where's the switch? There is a cable. There it is. I got my first kiss from Torben here, and my first alcohol poisoning from tequila. I'll get you some sheets. Wait. All right? Great. - I'll take that. - Here. - There. - Thanks. You smell good. Sure. Really. Right there, you smell so good. What is it? Schnapps. Apricot, hm? Some water? Yes, absolutely. And now? Let's get some sleep. No, let's kiss. No, let's sleep. Come on. Just one. A little one. - A little one? - Yes. A proper one. Once? I thought so. When do you have to get up tomorrow? - When do you have to get up? - Who cares? Off to bed now. You talk to me as if I were five. But I'm not five. Then don't behave as if you are. Okay. Is this better? Is it? Stop it. That's silly. What? What's wrong? - Is this silly? - Yes, it is. It's silly? Do you notice that you're letting me down? Does it feel good? No, it feels bad. Then don't do it. I don't think I want to. Don't. Just stop it! Are you okay? Let me have a look. It's fine. I don't think it's too bad. What's your problem? No. Are you serious? Are you done? Come on. Get off of me. Hello. Hello. Are you coming over? With pleasure. The sunshine is so nice in the garden. Where do you live? Come in. - Oops, what happened? - There was a sharp edge out of the blue. I see. Plenty of booze, right? Yes, that too. Since when have you been living here? Sissi didn't like the old house, but this isn't right either. Some bread? No, thanks. Anything to drink? Coffee. How was it yesterday? I was asked to be a ghostwriter. That's not bad. - Milk? - Yes, please. I wasn't joking yesterday. I'm looking for someone. My editor-in-chief is pregnant, and now she has cysts or something. She's suddenly bedridden. In case you're interested. Think about it. Okay. I will. It's empty. I'll go into the basement. I'll get some blackberries too. Oh, my God. What happened? The rails behind the trees. It's a train track. Is it your cat? It's Sissi's. So, yes, it's ours. Do you have a cloth? A towel? A kitchen towel? Check the laundry basket. I thought you were at Monica's. What are you doing here? I live here. Why? Hello. What are you two doing here? The train got her. It's okay. Hey, hey, hey, hey. This damn house! These damn tracks! Once you've got a foot in the door, it'll stay there. Great. You see? We're about to move. Which I find silly anyway. It doesn't help anybody if you stay in this house for Piet. It helps him. You'll always pay if you don't do things for others. Yes. Andrea, for example. He fucks his students while she has herself sectioned again. And she takes care of her mother-in-law. The pustules all over her body have returned, this bad rash. And Helga... she got it right. She didn't run after a guy. She's doing a trip around the globe. She must have got it right. You know what I mean. I don't want to get a rash. Piet will have to understand. What happened to your eye? There was a guy at the class reunion. He wanted to and I didn't. What? And then? Nothing. What did he want? Oh, Mom, he wanted to go for a swim. A swim. Who was it? You don't know him. Marcel. And what did Marcel do? Nothing. I can defend myself. I can tell. That's why you've got a black eye. Because I stumbled against an edge. It's enough. I don't like it. That's not the point. No means no. Please... - Yes, I like this. - Me too. It's really great. - Now tell me what happened. - Nothing happened. Marcel wanted to go swimming, I stumbled. And then? You're hysterical. Stop it. - No, I'm not, and I won't. - Stop it. Now! How are you anyway? - Hello. - Hello. Hello. Say hi to Lisa. I'll do it, yes. I'll clarify that about the titles. I'll be in touch. You too. Bye. Hi. Excuse me. What happened? I ran into a cupboard in the dark. - Where? - At the Kimmler's. Let me have a look. It's fine. Can you take down the coat rack? The screws are too tight. - Is that all? - No. - The copier needs to be dumped. - What? - The copier. - Okay. And Samuel's ugly award... Well, that will be all... then. Come here. Come here. Everybody must think I hit you. Shit. Wait. Put it down. How was the class reunion? Nice. Those who attended are building houses and having children. Those who aren't weren't there. We're building a house too. And I attended. Thanks. Didn't you order tofu? Excuse me. No, it doesn't matter. Why? I heard you order. She wanted it without meat. It said chicken. Super, thanks. Clemens' text is great. Very rough... very personal. Really... I like it very much. You must read it. We're bankrupt, Piet. - We're printing three books. - So what? - What do you mean? - That doesn't change anything. Even Mr. Horn said... that a new start is no problem. He just wants to know whether to liquidate or to surrender. Do you think he cares? Do you not care anymore either? I’ve torn myself to pieces for it for six years. You're so stupid. You want to give up, right? I met Robert Seifert at the reunion. I used to babysit his children. He is head of humanities at the Werder publishing house. He offered me a job. What kind of job? As a stand-in for his editor-in-chief. She's pregnant. What? She is bedridden with cysts. I see. You want to write factual books? It's not bad, strictly speaking. It's great, strictly speaking, but we're moving. I haven't confirmed yet. So why are you telling me? I just wanted to talk about it. Then talk. What is it? - Do you have the bottle opener? - No. - You had it a moment ago. - But not now, as you can see. - Did you pocket it? - What do you want? The bottle opener. Just check. Maybe you accidentally put it in your pockets. Okay, Janne, no worries. It's on her. Okay, you're not drunk. It doesn't matter. I'll call anyway. You don't have to answer. Yes. Yes. Kisses. See you. You girls. What did you do wrong? I had a life before her. How dare you? You wanted to read this. From Samuel. Right. Thanks. Have a look next door. That'd be your office. We can put in a smaller table. You'd have room for a two-seater. I need to know by tomorrow. There's another candidate. Sleep on it. Where are your boys? With their mother in Holland. Not a good subject. Please, you have to take it. I need at least one woman in my life who stands by me. - Hello. - Hello. Hello. Will you join me for the theatre? Sissi isn't feeling well. - What are they showing? - Nora. The opening night. Have a look what I found. His phone has been switched off for six days. A bit too much of a dying swan. Nice. Where were you? - Here. - Sorry, I had to make a call. There's Martin. A good friend and my brother-in-law. He's in charge of merging the departments. How funny. Hello. - Hello. - You know each other? From the reunion. Of course, we were there too. There goes the bell. How was the wedding? So-so. Do you want to talk? Want to? Okay, can we talk? Maybe not here. Did you like it? So-so. And you? No, it's stupidly vain. What is this merger? Two departments are merged. We've been in charge for three months. And for how much longer? Six weeks. Hey. Hello, Eve. It's you. Hello. - You're here? - Of course. What did you make of it? I fell asleep several times. - I'm surprised. - Did you like it? - Yes. - Yes? - We're going to Schumann's. You too? - With pleasure. - See you later. - Yes. The wife of the publisher. A very nice person. I'm invited to a birthday party and I promised I'd go. - That's a pity. - Yes. - I'll be in touch. - Yes. - Have a nice evening. - You too. - Bye. - Bye. Where were you? In the house and on the panel in London. We had canceled it. Yes, and I reconfirmed. It was nice. They send their regards. What? I just wanted to talk about it. I don't want to talk about it. I do. No. You want permission, but you have to sort it out yourself. It's just a pity about the piano. There's some coffee. And you? None of your business. You also do what you want. Hi. You wanted me to let you know. So I'm letting you know. I'm happy too. Yes. A very normal process. Hello. Come in. We're done anyway. Remember the memo for Friday and I'll send you the questionnaire. Exactly. Thanks. - Bye. - Bye. Hi. - Hi. All good? - Yes. Martin said the class reunion was a nice evening. We danced tango. Is he a good dancer? So-so. That's what he needs. We have to hurry up. I need to go to the fertility clinic in an hour and a half. Do you want children? If your older ones don't talk to you anymore, you make new ones. I'm looking forward to it. Really. Janne? Yes? Should we talk now? It doesn't have to be here. We could go for a coffee. Sorry, we have visitors. - What do you want to talk about? - Well... I'm sorry. I don't know... how to behave now. You don't do anything now. What would you do? It's not as if... I don't know... You have to... to say what you need or what I can do. You're sweet. You could bring me some chocolate. - Don't let us... - Hello. I meant the one on Tumblinger Street. - The garage. - Got it. Thanks. - Ciao. - Bye. I just wanted to say that I'll do as you wish. Robert doesn't know anything. If it's important to you, I'm all right with it. No, it's not. To the contrary. Let's keep Robert out of it and not make it any more complicated. I could hand over to a colleague. No problem. This is all too much. I don't want to make a big thing of it. - Okay. - Okay? As you wish. That's all I wanted to say. - It matters to me what you want. - I don't want anything. Thanks. It's... Thanks. All is well. - Okay. - Really. Okay, see you. Careful with the rosemary or the fish will become bitter. Yes, we need thyme. How is Robert? He seems to have marriage problems. Otherwise, he's fine. - Do you know Robert? - No, why? Just asking. What will you do with the house? - We'll see. - How many rooms does it have? I know plenty of people who'd like it. Heiner with his family and grandchildren. He's been looking forever. A weekly swap or so. I'd also like to... Sabine, it's a building site. I mean, in the long run. Mom, just stop it. I think we have enough potatoes. Just this last one, okay? How old is Robert? Fifty-five, 56? And now? I could sleep with you. Okay. Careful, don't stumble. Come down. Good. I'll give you some paper to wipe off. Here, for the jelly. Then... ...talk more? Yes. Werner, I can't talk right now. Okay, great. Great, perfect. Bye. Yes, exactly. Seven thirty to eight. Yes, bye. Until Wednesday of next week, but it'll be tight. There is the option of a drug-induced abortion. You take a pill, and a day or two later you have an abortion at home, and then you come in for a check-up. Afterwards, you'll have an abortion with instruments. A kind of curettage under anesthetics. In Germany, you can have this legally done until mid-September, even until the end of September. This means... Yes. That can happen easily. Yes, the subtitle is also in the subjunctive. Exactly. All right. Bye. Did you smoke? Yes, one by the window. Do you have some more? What do you mean, you're not allowed? Dr. Habicht says it makes you impotent. One cigarette is equal to a nervous breakdown. It's a misbelief... that a young wife makes you feel young. A young wife makes you feel old. Mirjam's office. Henning's. Who is Henning? Robert's. And mine. I see. You have an appointment? You could have come with me... and met everybody. Hermann and the rest. Yes. Piet... Robert. Robert, Piet. - Hello. - Nice to meet you. You too. So? What are you going to do? Maybe have a bite? Hungry? You both can come. There'll be good food. We ordered a caterer. It's my brother-in-law's birthday. We're combining it with the office party. - Sounds nice. - Yes. We're going to Isar Bowling. It's a tradition. I went there 20 years ago with his father. What? Come on, don't be so fussy. Bowling is fun. What is it? A success, huh? - Congratulations. - Thanks. Piet, Martin. - Hello, happy birthday. - Thanks. And you can't drown? No, the salt water makes you float. - This one's locked. - It's like floating, really great. What did you get your brother? A wine seminar. He wants to know more, but then, he doesn't. And then she tells this psychological counselor... By the way, a very nice lady. Very nice. Sitting in front of a wall with babies in eggshells. Never mind. She talks to her and I sit next to her, okay? I sit next to her, I'm there, but she tells her... that she crosses the desert on her own and is dying of thirst. She's almost dead. And then I come along, carrying water bottles. I'm drinking from one, and I'm pouring one... for... over my head, and I don't give her even one bottle. She's serious about this image. And this counselor... she latches on to this. You laugh. Should I be talking with them about water bottles? - What would you do? - I wouldn't tolerate it. Well, but I... I simply wouldn't tolerate it. I'm just trying to understand her. Fuck her three times a day. She may get pregnant and be in a better mood. - Hey, hello. - Hi. How did this happen? - Robert asked and Piet likes bowling. - Okay. And how are things? All right. I'm pregnant. Did you know you have to wait three days after the counseling before you can go to a clinic? To reflect. So that you don't make a rash or wrong decision. Can I do anything? Like what? See. Don't be presumptuous. It may not be yours. I've been up since six, I'm dead tired. Martin told me some useful things. About the business. How to set it up and so. - He's really nice. - Yes, he's nice. Come here. What's up? There's Samuel. I don't want to. Just wait. Hey. Hi. How are you? What's going on? Aren't you ashamed? - Not really. - What? We've been trying to get in touch with you for weeks. Why don't you talk to us? Piet, nobody can talk to you. You know what? You're a coward and an asshole. Hello. Hi. Hi. Are you crazy? - See what I mean? - Are you completely crazy? - Piet, stop it. - I told you so. - Piet, stop it. - Aren't you great? - Piet, stop it. - You're the super best. What? Stop it. What, Janne, what? Am I not right? - Are we going to calm down? - Oh, God. Go and write tickets. - I can call my colleagues. - Gosh, we're just talking. What is it, Janne? He doesn't mean to. - Yes, I mean it. - Calm down. - He'll calm down. - No, I won't. We know him and we can handle it. You can go. It doesn't look like it. Go. Just go! With pleasure. All right... All is well. Thanks. - You sure? - Yes, thanks. So you can handle this, okay? - Come on. - What? - Piet, I'm on your side. - No. - Yes, I am. - You're not. - Piet, listen, I'm on your side. - Just leave me alone. Janne, leave me alone. You? And you? What are you doing here? Preface for Henning. And you? Did something happen? Not yet. This happened. What did you do? I did nothing. It was Sissi. What? Yes. She kicked me out of the bed. And then she kept kicking me. What? Why? Because I was tired. She's completely mad. - And you let her kick you? - Well, I can't kick back. Yes, you can. This is ridiculous. It has to stop. How? I'll book you a hotel room. Piet? What? Will you let me in? No. Thanks. - And who will take you home? - A taxi. Who is your escort? - The taxi driver. - That's not possible. Why not? We can't discharge you without an escort. You're not roadworthy and will suffer the effects of a general anaesthetic. That's why I'll take a taxi. You can't. It said so in the flyer and we told you so. That's stupid. The taxi driver can come in here... Ms. Mann, I won't discuss this now. I can't let you in the surgery area unless you have an escort. Sabine Mann. Yes, I'm waiting for Sabine. I... Piet, I understood you. Just turn around and go home. I'll wait here. So... I said you shouldn't come. Well, your mother is at the seminar in Hamburg and she's worried. Did you have an abortion? Can you get up? - Please go. - What? Piss off. So, I'll just check your blood pressure, and if all is well, you can go. Just relax. It's great, 125 over 80. Let yourself be pampered. - Maybe with some chicken soup? - Yes, maybe. Ms. Mann. - Bye. - Safe journey. - Bye. - Okay, bye. What are you doing here? - Tell me what this is all about. - Leave me... What do you want from me? Nothing. I'll sleep the next two nights at Clemens' place. I'm helping him move. If you spend the following two nights elsewhere, I could get my stuff out. Could we please talk? No, I don't want to talk anymore. Honestly. Can you go upstairs by yourself? Your mother will need this. Okay, I'll go to the office and send it to her. Hey! Are you crazy? Are you okay? I can, let's see. Where are you, at home? Hello, is Robert here? No. He's not here, I'll call you back. It was Sissi. Robert isn't at home. Do you know where he is? Sure. I've booked him a hotel room. Why? I see. - What does this mean? - I didn't know. I just didn't know. What do you want now? - Nothing, I want nothing. - Right, you never want anything. Quite bad that you can't say or do anything. Really bad. It's tough for you. Can you tell me what's going on? Nothing. Why? All is super. And you? No idea, you tell me. Really? And what? You still won't know. You never know, do you? We've been there before. You still won't know what to say or do. You never do. Or did you ever? Was there ever a time or is your tiny bird brain as big as your prick? Should I touch you? - Here? - Stop it. Stop it? - Here? - Stop it. Stop it? Stop it, yes? - I should stop? - Yes... You don't want it? You don't like it? It feels good here. Hey! - Stop it. - Hey, hey, hey. What is it? What is it? - Here? - Janne. Don't make a fuss. - What is it? - Stop! Piss off! Don't touch me! Robert couldn't get a hold of you. I need the report. I'm sending it to you. - I need to go to Cologne tomorrow. - I'm sending it to you. Why don't you answer your damn phone? What's going on? Why don't you answer when I call? What happened? Should I come back? I'll be there soon. Okay. The potatoes are still a little hard. - Hello. - Hello. - Robert's coming later to the seminar. - Okay. Call him. No, he doesn't answer. - Take mine. He answers my calls. - Yes. He answers your calls. That's kind, but... He has to want it. - Hey. - Hello. I left Sissi. - Have you heard anything from Martin? - He'll probably be here shortly. - I'll say a few words, okay? - Okay. Good morning, everybody. Good morning. It was an important... and, I think, a very emotional and... moving time for us. The last day. I believe Mirjam has planned something nice for us. I wish you all a nice last experience. Please, Mirjam. Two. Two. - Carry on. Two. - Two. One. - Two. - Three. Almost. Great. Not bad. Not bad for a first. - Those two? - Is it at the back? They can be fast and end up under the table. I'm looking. So far we only got those two balls. - That's not good. - Sorry. - Thanks. - No problem. Who wants to... If I learned anything today, it's that teamwork doesn't work. Let's be honest. On my own, the ball would have been in the dish in 30 seconds. The ball dropped. It disappeared once. In some trouser or jacket pocket. Where was it? Was it you? How was it for you, Susanne? It was strange. There were just two balls. The last one to have one should have said "here" immediately. It was irritating. A complete break. We shouldn't blow the whole thing out of proportion. That's not the point. We just want to describe an external perception. It's non-judgmental. Anybody else? How was it for you, Franziska? It felt rather encroaching to me. We all forgot about the ball. Maybe I hadn't forgotten about it if it had been there. Or if she hadn't pocketed it. There were irritations. How was it for you? I didn't even notice. - Janne, could you please come? - Sure. Excuse me. Can you take some of my appointments and cancel others? Fanny could cancel them. Just tell her... Martin had an accident. Yes, last night... he had an accident. With the car. Well, they don't know yet... - I got the call just ten minutes ago. - Yes. We're going to the intensive care unit and... Listen, I want to keep the appointment with Hermann. You deal with Mr. Meyer. And the others... You'll manage, won't you? Don't worry. - Please come with me. - No. I just have to take down your details and you can get on the next train. The machine was broken. I won't get off. There are two machines at every station. - Come on. - I wanted to buy a ticket. Okay, then we'll stop the train here and get the police. Their office is upstairs. I must go on. The machine was broken. I won't get off. Come with me, please. Get off. No. Come on, you're keeping everybody waiting. - Get off. - Now. Now. - Come on. - I tried to buy a ticket. The machine was broken. - I know. - I couldn't buy a ticket. I won't get off. I have to go on. It's useless. Get off already. We want to go on. What's going on? Schulze speaking. We're at Arabellapark. Could you send someone over? Thanks.
