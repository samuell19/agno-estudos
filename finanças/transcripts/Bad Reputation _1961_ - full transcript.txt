Damn right. Gamefowls fight to the death, after all. Hey, let's go. Get out of my way! Get out! - What the hell are you doing? - Shut up! What do you take us for? That's his. - And who are you? - Me? I'm from Takayasu. Get out of my way! So, who's the one running this? Is it you? What's with the big fuss? It's just one gamecock. You just don't want any competition. So, you're barging in on us. Enough bullshiting. We're not fools. You're trying to run cockfight bets. You're just a chicken thief. You bastard! - Wanna fight? - Wait up. This is my fight. Come on. You guys stay out of it. You bastard! Damn bastard! Wait! - Come back here! - Wait up! The fowl's running away. Catch it! Under there. Idiot! Who in his right mind plays around with gamefowl? Nothing good comes out of cockfight betting. Let alone steal someone else's gamefowl. Kawachi peasants have been farmers since long ago. And they've been warriors when war arised. Shame on you! Return the gamefowl immediately. Here's your gamefowl back. Tell your brother that I returned it. We finally had something fun going on. - What about women? - Women? That sounds good. We'll probably need money. - Of course. - Where exactly? There's a Bon festival. - Which Bon festival? - Takayasu. We can't go there because of the cockfights. If you're that worried, we could go disguised as women. What do you say? You're a good dancer. Care to join me? Fool, take a better look. Oh, you are a man? You idiot. I'm surprised you found me out. It was easy to find you. What? You look cute. I did this to prank a friend. Have a seat. You live in Nakano village? Yes. What are you doing? You know what I want. Will you come see me from now on? I feel like the Bon Dance Festival was a long time ago. You barely drank anything. I know. Why can't you handle alcohol? I also wonder. I'm no match even for you. You can handle a woman though, so you win. In fact... I have a husband. I kept it a secret because I was afraid you would not see me. Forgive me. You see, this is my first time knowing the joys of womanhood. I... I'm pregnant with your child. In a little while, my belly will grow. And the villagers will notice. Say... Wanna run away together? Do you want to elope? There's an inn in Arima that I could work for as a maid. It must be boring for a young man like you to stand around and do nothing, right? Take me, for example. This old lady here, too, she used to be a remarkable geisha. She was very popular with men. But she ended up with an ordinary man like me and look at us now. You are still young, so think carefully about your life. We're about to have a baby. Are you sure about that? Isn't she playing with you? She played you from the start. Listen to me and go back home. It hurts. It really hurts... Don't kiss so hard, it'll leave a mark. Never mind. Miss Kiyo. Here. You don't have to. It's okay. Just take it. See you. Oh my. Did you come to pick me up? Don't be absurd. Like I would pick up a prostitute. - Dear, where are you going? - Leave me alone. - I'm going back home. - Hey... Please don't dump me. Forgive me. I'll do honest work from tomorrow. Please. I don't care. Dear! Asakichi! What are you doing here? What about you guys? We're returning from our pilgrimage to Ise. And you're passing through Osaka? We could've had fun around Ise, but we were scared of divine retribution, So we decided to go to the Matsushima red light district in Osaka instead. I see. Mind if I join you? - Are you serious? - Let's go! Oh, here they come. We were waiting for you. - Good evening. - Thanks for your service. Have a seat. We'll be drinking together now, So keep the drinks coming. Look at this business woman here. Alright then, shall we drink? Say, where are you guys coming from? On my Ise pilgrimage, at a tea house, I met... - Have a drink. - I can't drink. You go ahead. Thank you. What's wrong? Are you that eager to be alone with her? It's none of your business. Want to go outside? Your name is Oi? How do you know my name? It's written right here on these notices. My professional name here is Kotoito. You used to be a geisha? I used to work in Hakata. So, how did you end up here? I guess it's the usual circumstances. My dad got sick in the coal mines... Those brats. They are so loud. You're the one who needs to look where he's going. There's a thing called priority. What priority? show me! What? What are you doing? Wanna fight? You fool. Hey, who do you think you are? Come and get me if you dare. I'm not moving a single step from here! What's wrong with this broad? I'll kick your ass. Come now, she's just drunk. I don't care, she needs to be taught a lesson. Beat me! Kill me! I dare you. Do you know who I am? I may be a prostitute now, but I used to... Stop it! Die, you bastard! Beat me! You bitch! Damn you! Damn it! I'm glad it settled down. I was worried. I would've also jumped in if you hadn't stopped me. I just don't like guys who abuse their strength. I can tell just by looking at you. So, you always feel like siding with the weak? Right. I wish you could help me, too. I feel like I'll never get out of here. I'm going to rot to bones and die. Must be hard dealing with bad customers. I really feel like dying. You are young and beautiful, So I think you can have an elegant customer. You should make a lot of money and quit this job. Want to go to bed? Yeah, shall we? Taking off my kimono sash on our first meeting is embarrassing, though. Asakichi, can I come in? What? Just come in. What's wrong? Those men are loitering outside. They're waiting for you guys. - You... - Don't worry. Have a leisurely breakfast and stand tall. Can you wait? What? Are you their leader? What would they need a leader for? You're a jokester, I see. Listen here. I'm the one in charge of this turf, I'm Sada of the Yoshioka gang. We can't let this humiliation go unpunished. You need a good beating for it. Run away! I lost. You're strong. What was that about the Yoshioka gang? You're just talk. Hey, guys. So, you're from Yoshioka's gang? Fighting in front of my shop So early and breaking stuff... What are you gonna do about that? You have to pay! I didn’t break it. You obviously are the one who broke it. Come on, you have to pay for the damage. Look at that. How much? I would say 50. That's greedy, make it 10. You're the stingy one with 10. Whatever, 10 will do. Don't do this anymore. You guys are a nuisance. That settles it, right? Hey, let's go. How about we forget about this fight and hang out for a little? Don't be absurd. We're opponents, we can't hang out. Let's go. Hey, you, can you wait? What? I'm Yoshioka. This is my territory. Right? Do you understand? Can you come with me? To where? My place. Asakichi... I have to go now, since the Oyabun personally invited me. But... I'm gonna be fine. Don't worry. Our "Motor" Sada here is know for his horse power, but you managed to beat him. So, you must be quite strong. Nah, I'm not strong. To be honest, your Sada is much stronger. Stop complimenting. Where are you heading to now? Where to? I don't really have a place in mind. Then, how about you stick around? So, you want me to be your henchman? I don't mean that. I'm not forcing you. I hate the yakuza. No, you'll be treated as a guest. What kind of business do you do here? We deal in information. It's an interesting business that makes money out of information. Fighting and gambling are of the past. Have a drink and think about it. I can't drink. Oh, I see. Sada. Be sure to teach them a lesson. - Chuko. - Yes? Stand up. You ran away. No, I ran to tell the Oyabun that you were in danger... Shut up! Forgive me. - Shige. -Yes? I just went to ask for a helper. Don't make excuses. Forgive me. Stop it. Don't stop him. This is our rule. Just hear me out. This is because of our fight, isn't it? I mean, who would admit of running away in front of their opponent, right? And I'm sure it's not their first time running away. So, I'm asking you to forgive them. I will, only if you become our guest. Otherwise, I can't do what you ask. Very well, I'll be loafing around here, then. Is that so? Hey, Sada, forgive them. I don't mind hanging around, but I'm sure it's not for free, right, Sada? With you around, I'm sure we can take on 100 men. This is amazing, though. It hasn't even been long since you came, but you're already one of us now. Even the Hanme gang know about you. Hanme gang? Their Oyabun has always been our Oyabun's rival. So, I am a bouncer, after all. - That's what I thought. - It's pretty good to live here. I felt uncomfortable when I heard that. Don't say that. Bro, you like betting? I like it. Shall we bet on the dice, then? It won't matter if you lose. Ready? Everybody ready? Here I go. Game on! One more. Anyone want to bet on odd? Even! I'm betting on even! What should we bet on? What's this? Everyone's betting on even, no one is betting on odd. This is no match. Hey, you over there, you've been watching only. How about you bet on odd? Am I the only one to put on odd? How much? 30 yen. 30 yen? I'll bet on it, then. You're betting 30 yen, right? Everyone understood? We're going to start, be prepared. Game! Sada, let's go. Are you leaving? - That's too bad - I only play once, you know? Don't worry. Please play more. That's just winning and dashing. That's a weird thing to say. Should I play until I run out of money, then? You should be careful about how you speak. Do you take us for fools, huh? What are you saying? It was a fair bet. If it were even instead, you would've taken my money, am I right? So, I did nothing wrong. Plus, if I keep betting in this awful gambling den... What did you just say, kid? Don't say bullshit! Wait, hold on! You're quite an interesting fellow. Don't take this the wrong way. He just wanted you to have more fun. Is that so? We'll be going now, then. Thanks. - Visit us again. - Alright, good evening. Bro. That was a scary thing to do. I thought you were gonna lose a leg or something. What are you talking about? I'm fine and kicking, as you can see. You're one hell of a man. I guess I'm stuck with the Yoshioka now. That's right. Take half. Come on! Thanks. I'm off to Matsushima. What's wrong? Someone nice like you... You'll eventually stop coming. You're just a customer, after all. What are you talking about? I've been coming here all this time. It's no use... My father chastised me last night. Why? Because I neglected an important customer. What a detestable father. Trying to make me the plaything of a despicable brute. Oh, how I want to die! Can't you just run away? I can't. They have nets all over the place. Don't you have the right to voluntarily go out of business? Only on paper. I wouldn't mind risking my life if you'd say that you'll run away with me. You want me to take you away? Very well. Do you mean it? But we must prepare everything carefully. If it's with you, I'm okay with anything. Please take me away from here, no matter what. Don't worry, come in. sada, I need to tell you Something. Leave that for later. I'm sorry, but you have to come with me right now. What's wrong? A Oyabun allied with our Oyabun is in trouble and needs help. so, we have to send Some people. Oyabun asked you to go. - Asakichi... - Miss, forgive me for this. I'll wait for you. Don't do anything dangerous. Think of me, alright? Please. Don't worry. We should think about escaping later, okay? Don't move, don't move! Thank you. Be careful. Okay, let's go. Oyabun, could you wait a moment? What are you doing here? I thought it was the last time I would see you. I'll be okay. You shouldn't have come. Come here. Hurry up! I'm sorry, but can you hide her upstairs for a while? I'll be back soon once I finish this battle. Hey, wait! You! He is so selfish. I don't know what's going on, but you should go upstairs for now. That's a problem, we can't have you bring that kind of trouble to us. I'm sorry. No use apologizing. Just leave. They'll be looking for you, anyway. Our gang has no chance against the Matsushima lot. Oh, no! Run away! Go through the backdoor. Hurry up, quick! What are you doing here? Help me. I won't cause you any trouble. I'm begging you. Okay, come in. I don't know. Don't ask me. Well, we're just going to wait here until your guest, Asakichi, comes back. You didn't get to show off your skills because of Tennoji's Oyabun mediation. What a pity! Nah, it's better that we didn't have to fight. Who are they? They are Matsushima men. And they're saying that Asakichi absconded with one of their woman. Huh? What's wrong? Sada, did you know that Asakichi absconded with a Matsushima girl? Huh? That's news to me. And where's Asakichi? He came back with us, I wonder where did he disappear to? - Did you let him go? - No way. I really don't know anything. I'll look into it once he returns, and, if that's the case, I will definitely have him send her back. So, please wait calmly. I'm putting my trust in you, then, and head back. Let's go. - That's true. - Huh? Asakichi asked me to hide her. Really? That's a problem, where is she? - I let her out the back. - No, that can't be. We want nothing to do with the Matsushima group. Oh, Asakichi. I didn't want to cause you trouble, so I hid in the neighborhood. What have you done? You need to tell me about such things first. Oyabun, it's not like you could do anything about it, even if you knew. What? Come now. It's my fault, after all. I shall take my leave now, then. Please, do so. I have done you no favors, So I apologize for that. Never mind. Hey, bring me that. Take this as a parting gift. No, you don't have to do that. But I'll take this as today's work fee. Thanks. - Is the woman upstairs? - She's in the back, apparently. - Really? - Shall we go? Let's go. It's been a pleasure. - Where are you going, Sada? - I'm going to see him off. Mind your own business. What will you do if they see you help him? What's wrong with walking around with our guest? Idiot, once he steps out, he'll be just a stranger to us. Oyabun, so you're saying that a freeloader should know their place, instead of absconding with a woman? Of course. Very well, I understand Asakichi is no longer with us now. But what was that behaviour of yours in front of that Matsushima guy? What? They're clearly not men from the brothel, So why would you give Asakichi up so easily? Why wouldn't I? You easily grovel in front of the strong, and give up someone who's under your care... Shut up! I feel ridiculous for being in such a miserable gang. Really now? - So, you want to quit? - Yes. - My pledge is over. - Okay, you're out. Is that so? Thank you for all your help. - Let's go, then. - Sure. What are you guys doing? Give him a good farewell. Take care, bro! You idiots! Beat him up! Wanna go? Bring it on! - Where are you running to? - I'm sorry. Off I go, then. Feel free to come after me. My mother ran away with her a while ago. - Right? - Yes. Do you know where she's gone? I don't know, but don't worry. I do worry, though. So, where's your mom? She went on pilgrimage to Mt. Koya after. So, she won't be back for two or three days. I see. You want to meet her? I guess it's okay if she's escaped. But you look down. No way. Anyway, sorry for the trouble. I want to thank you. Would you mind joining us for a meal? That's fine. But if you really want to, since we work at a meat restaurant, and we're about to go there now, why don't you join us there? - Right? - Yeah. That's convenient. Sada, shall we go, then? I want to eat meat, too. Let's go, then. May I have your names? - I'm Okinu. - I'm Oteru. That's where we work. You are so kind. Your mother is kind, too. She's very different from Yoshioka. That's true. Mind joining me for a moment? Leave it to me. Will he be fine? No need to worry. They're no match for him. Where should we wait for him? Yes, I know Kotoito. But why come to me after she ran away? It's not like I'm her only customer. Plus, she could have gone out of business voluntarily. I mean, why would I still play around in Matsushima if I had helped her escape? I'm not listening to your bullshit. I won't mind fighting you. But I don't know anything about Kotoito. Do you hear me? Enough bullshit. Throw your dagger on the ground. What? If you draw your dagger out, I'll be forced to use my pistol. Wait, you have a gun? Of course I do, you idiot! You never know who's gonna come after you, so you need to carry a pistol, at least. If you think it's unfair, why don't you go ask your Oyabun for one? I'll wait for you here. Or instead... Or instead, what? Say it. I won't complain if I lose, but, if I win, I'll go to Matsushima, and kill your Oyabun. Your choice. Asakichi. I'll drop my dagger, So you drop your pistol, too. Is that okay with you? I'm okay. Well, I'm not. What? Aren't the guys you brought with you scattered around here somewhere? If they intervene... I'll shoot you, got it? That's... Then, get them out of here. - Very well. - Hey. Leave your dagger here. I'll take care of it. Shall we start, then? - Just get out of here. - What? I'll kill you otherwise. What? - But that's my dagger. - That's right. This is your dagger. I don't have a pistol. Say what? So, where do you wanna get stabbed? In the eye or the stomach? Damn it. You'll regret this! What a fool. Thanks for waiting. Please. Please have a seat. Bro, I want to formally ask you. What are you doing? Allow me to take you as my Oyabun and work under you. - Please accept my pledge. - What are you saying? You know how I feel about yakuzas. I know that, but I... Enough with this farce. Excuse me? Farce, you say? I won't let that pass even for you. Do you want to fight with me? Stop it! Sada. What? How about just being sworn brothers? What do you say? Bro. I was scared for a moment there. How dare you worry us like that? Let's have a friendly drink. - Bring sake. - Right away. Time for us to get to work. That woman is so lucky to have Someone risk their life for her. You're such a good person. He sure is. He never goes back on his word. That's not true. That's called being a softie. Thanks for waiting. Have this until the sukiyaki is ready. - Here you go, Okinu. - Yes. - Please. - I can't drink. Really? Yes, but I'll try a little. Thanks. Here, bro. You have to make a toast for that girl. Anyway, let's pray for her safety. These two are such nice people, aren't they, Oteru? You don't have to put me in the same boat, you know. But I like you. What a turn of events. - I know you like me, too. - She doesn't hold back, does she? I won't serve you if you don't like me. I do, I like you. I really do. I'm so glad. Shall we get drunk tonight and stay somewhere else? That sounds good. Let's go, Okinu. I've never stayed out before. Don't worry. I can't do that. If you can't, we'll go without you. Alright? Go ahead. Thank you very much. What's wrong with Okinu? She could at least send us off. Don't worry about it. Oh, she is already in the car. She really is! Are you okay with a henchman taking back his pledge? I am so frustrated I can't sleep. My principle is not to stop anyone who wants to join or leave. No wonder only bums come here for free lodging and a meal. What a bunch of good-for-nothing freeloaders. Who's there? - Yoshioka! - Damn you! Please wait! It's a raid! Please wait! Please wait! I have no intention to oppose Matsushima. I cut ties with those guys. Please wait! Help me! It's my first time taking a bath with a man. Really? Oh my, Asakichi, do you take me for a loose woman? Why are you getting so angry? I mean... Sada and Oteru are a couple now, apparently. So it seems. What about us? There's nothing between us. Then, why'd you come here? Is it wrong that I came here? I guess not, but... Just because they became a couple, it doesn't mean that we have to become one, too. Don't you already have Miss Kotoito? She's just a playmate. Just for a playmate, would you go crossing a dangerous bridge, and help her abscond? Why make it sound like I did a bad thing now? I guess you're right... You'll have a hard time if you stick with me. I don't mind. According to circumstances, we might have to travel all over Japan. And you never know where and when I'll get killed. Even so, I want to be with you. It looks like the experience with my ex-husband hasn't taught me anything, if I still fell for someone like you. I guess I like to struggle. What if I leave you with a baby? I'll just raise it up while crying. You're so weird. Oh, my god! Wait a second, miss! Stop, stop it! You don't like me? I like you. So, it's okay. I want you to write me an IOU. Or else, you can forget about it. Write an IOU? Please write: "From Asakichi to Okinu”, "I will take you as my wife forever.” You make it sound as if I owe you money. Fine, I'll write it. I might as well add a blood stamp, then. Is this okay? Ouch! Oh, no! Now, after writing that, I don't know what to do next. Don't worry, I won't refuse you. Alright, I'm gonna get you. How did it go? Look at you, looking all refreshed. Oteru, I've made my wish come true. The one to give your virginity to a good man? Don't say it out loud. What a wonderful thing. Congratulations. Shall we clap for that? Well... No need to get shy now. Enough joking around. I don't want to impose, but after eating, could you two go back to check out the situation? Certainly. Then, come back later. Okay, go ahead. Take care. - Thank you. - Be well. - Bad luck. - Thanks. Today's not my day. I'm having bad luck. Thanks. Here I go! - You won. - I won. I see. Alright. I'll stop. You are strong. Bro, you can cheat. No, I don't like cheating. There is no loss in deceit. Sada, by the way... They haven't come back for four days. I wonder if they had any problems. I'm starting to worry, too. Our money's also starting to run low. They are back, bro. Really? What happened? You got us worried. - A terrible thing has happened? - What is it? The Matsushima men attacked the Yoshioka gang, and had their Oyabun half beaten to death. It serves him right. It's his fault, anyway. Don't say that. This all started because of me. - Time to give them tit for tat. - You can't. They are looking for you. It's fine. I'll meet them right away. - But there's more. - They've caught Kotoito. How in the world did that happen? She was worried for you, and when she went to Yoshioka to ask about you, she got caught by Matsushima's men. I got this letter from her before coming here. She is on Innoshima. Innoshima? She is on Innoshima in the Seto Inland Sea. Okinu, I have to go. I know. You can't ignore this, right? But don't push yourself too hard. I worry about you. Oteru, I'm sorry, but I'm gonna have to borrow Sada from you. - Will you be fine? - Yeah, just like any other day. We've just talked about this. What's wrong, bro? You're going to miss Okinu, am I right? Don't be absurd. That's not it. It's money. Money? For what? If we go to Innoshima, we have to prepare some money. Why? If something happens, we can solve it with money. You do have a point. I doubt that will be the case, but what if they want to settle it with money? We can't say we have no money. I see... But how shall we prepare the money? I guess I'll have to go to Arima. That's where you eloped. I doubt she's still there... But if I explain the situation to the old couple, I'm sure they'll lend me some money. She's still here? Really? She's upstairs. I see. Oh my, you came back? No, that's not it. I just need some money, and, as I was asking the old man, he said that you're still here. I thought as much. Not like I'd get my hopes up. You seem to be doing really well. Because you left me. You have money as well, I hear. I could lend you some. What do you need money for? Well, about that... I'm trying to help a man. Just say it's a woman. Am I right? You can be honest with me, there's no need to lie. You win. To be honest, I'm trying to help a woman. She was sold. That's what I thought. What's this? How did you get this? I'm just taking care of it. Under this situation... I do have saved money, but not that much on hand. So... Would you like to do something dangerous? I'll do anything. What will we do? There will be a gambling party in Kobe tomorrow. And, since I'll be working there, I'm going to tell you the hand of the other customers. You mean, cheating? It's the easiest way to make a lot of money. I don't like cheating. What if they found me? Leave it to me. You just have to trust me. Alright, I accept. By the way, I have a friend. Can we go together? - Thanks. - Wait. Are you going back now? Say, can you at least kiss me? I didn't expect it. Ready. Play. It was so nice. We made it, after all. I'm glad it worked really well. Now, that we have military funds, it's time to march into enemy territory! We might not be able to get on this ship ever again. Let's go. Hey, guys. You guys came here looking for a job? Yes, we are. Where are you staying? Do you guys happen to know any good inns? There's an inn called Tokaiya, you can try there. Tokaiya? How is it written? It's written as in "crossing the sea". - Shall we stay there? - Let's do that. - Much appreciated. - Thank you, now if you excuse us. Here it is. I see, "crossing the sea". What a good name. How many days will you stay? Four or five days. We'll stay more if we like it. So, you'll be the one taking care of us? - You don't like me? - No way. On the contrary. May I have your name? Oshige. I'll leave this here. Oshige. Let's get along well. If you expect additional services, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave. You got rejected imediately. You can go to the red light district for that, or even the bars around here. Thank you for the information. - Shall we have a bath and eat later? - Let's do that. Please come. Come in, mister. - We're waiting. - We'll come here later. Come on, enter. There are nice girls. Mister, come to our bar, will you? We'll come here later. Do you have any nice girls? Yes, we do. Please come in. We'll come back another time. - She's here. - That's what I thought. What's wrong with you? This is an island. I know that. How can we escape from here? Of course, we take a boat. - How can we get a boat? - I see. We need to hire someone who can help us. We have to be careful not to get caught. If only we could stay hidden for three days on this island... Right, I was thinking the same. I was thinking of scouting the roads, railroads and ferries, but I keep forgetting that this whole island is under their watch. You never know what the yakuza here is up to. If they toss us into this sea, it would be impossible for us to swim away from here. Oh, what's wrong? You came back so quietly. Excuse me, but there's something I'd like to ask you. Why are you formal, all of a sudden? Who's the Oyabun in charge of the red light district here? That would be silk Hat Oyabun. Silk Hat? Who's that? I heard he used to work in Nagano, but then got involved in rice speculation, and ran away wearing a silk hat. That's funny. He opened the red light district here. You can still see him wearing a silk hat while patroling with his men. - Oshige, are you a local? - Yes. I have never left this island since I was born. - Really? - Yes. Have you ever felt any sense of duty towards this Silk Hat Oyabun? No. Please be honest. Or, for example, trying to get into his good books? No... but why ask me that? What's with the sudden serious look? - Sada. - Huh? You plead with me, as well. Me too? Stop joking around... This is not a joke. We need your help. Please help us. Will you? I heard about you from Oshige. She says you're a big deal around here. So, I have a favor to ask of you. I'll just be frank. A woman we know ended up in Yamatoro, and we are planning to get her out. So, will you prepare a boat for us? It's true that, to escape from this place, you would definitely need a boat. That's right. Therefore, I'm sure they know all the waterways you can use to get out. So... So, you have to outsmart them by sailing the most unexpected route. That's why we're asking you. This is money for it. No, it's not a matter of money. Oh, you were awake? Of course, I was worried. - How was it? - Thank you. About that, we managed to convince him, and he agreed to help. See, I told you it'll be fine. He's being treated badly by the Silk Hat Oyabun. Oh, I see. Anyway, that's one thing taken care of. Say, Oshige, I believe it will be bad for the two of us to stick together, So I'd like to stay at a different inn. - Do you happen to know a good one? - There is a inn called Asaoka near here. How about it? It's a first class inn that the shipyard big shots use, and it's also their the Oyabun' home. What? There's another Oyabun aroud here? That's the person in charge of the shipyard. Alright. Now we just have to keep things quiet. So, you'll have to act as my contact with Sada. - I'm counting on you. - Leave it to me. - Excuse me. -Yes? Is this photo the same as the real person? Yes, it's exactly the same girl. She's way more beautiful in person than in the photo. - Alright, then I'll play. - Okay. Please come in. Kotoito, hurry up. He's waiting for you. Sorry to make you wait. This is the girl you've asked for, right? That's right. Oh, she is more beautiful than in the photo. Right? Would you like a room? This will do for today. - You won't be staying over? - I'll come here again. Don't worry. This money is for you, granny. - Thanks. - Bring something to drink, as well. Yes, sir. Please fill this out later, if you don't mind. - The police are strict. - I get it. Kotoito, I'm glad that you're safe. How did you know I was here? Your letter reached us immediately. Thank you for coming. Asakichi is here, too. He's doing everything to get you out. Going that far just for my sake... But it's impossible. There's no way to get out of here. You must not be weak. Asakichi is planning everything well. So, cheer up. Understand? Yes. Could you go out to watch a moving picture with me? That would be impossible. I see, so we'd have to sneak you out, then. Maybe during the Saba Daishi Festival, since it's once a month. And when is that? The day after tomorrow. Hey, mister. You got a nice woman. - Don't show off. - I'm sorry. Come on! Quick! Hurry up! Thanks for coming. We'll talk later. Hurry up! Gramps! What shall we do, dear? What happened, gramps? I'm sorry about this, but I hurt my leg at work. What are we going to do now? Don't worry. I'll sail. - Where is the boat? - We have it prepared. - Shall I take them instead? - Yes, do that. - Don't worry, I'll do it. - She's a better sailor than you. Oh, it's just you! Where are we going? We're going to Yugeshima first, and then take a ship to anywhere else but here. I wonder where did Kotoito go? I bet she ran away. If you go ask the Silk Hat Oyabun, they'll catch her in the harbor, hurry! Hurry up! Quick! What happened? The tide has turned in the opposite direction. So, where are we now? - Habu... - Habu? We were brought back to where we were. Alright, then. Just take us to the shore. - We have no choice but to hide. - You're right. I did my best. I know, thanks. Watch out your step. Here you go, good. Bro, you run away. Leave things here to me. - I'm counting on you. - Let's go. I'll go back. I always seem to cause you only trouble. What are you talking about? We're going through all this trouble because we want to help you. It can't be helped. Tomorrow, we'll just take a regular boat from the Habu port, okay? Either they kill us or we kill them. It'll be one or the other. - Welcome back. - I'm back. - Hey, mister. - What is it? Where's the woman from Yamatoro? We separated somewhere around the festival, right? Yes. You had a companion if I'm not mistaken. He didn't like this inn for some reason, and went to another one. Can I go now? There is a person in Asaoka who looks like him. I appreciate your efforts, but could you take us to him? What can I do for you? Hand over the woman. I can't just give you the woman when I payed for her services. If you won't hand her over willingly, we'll cut you up. What the hell are you talking about? I'll shoot before you can even get close to me. Pistol? So, what will it be? Come at me. Who wants to die first? You? Could you hand over the girl? I can't do that. You guys are still young, but you do wasteful things. It would be in your best interest to hand her over quietly. Thank you. But she intends to voluntarily go out of business. I won't stop her from doing that. But she has to go back first, and then go through the formal procedure. I can't let her go. I'll keep her with me until morning, and then take her to the police. So, you go home. I would lose face if I let her do that. You understand? If you don't hand her over, we'll take her back by force! Don't move. If anyone comes closer, Silk Hat gets a bullet in the face. Oyabun. Silk Hat, barging in here well aware that I am the head of this mansion is very disrespectful. No... About that, Oyabun... Whatever the circumstances might be, this man is one of my customers. I am really ashamed about this. - But what he did was... - Well, let's leave that for later. How about you let me handle this situation? You over there. What do you say? Mister Silk Hat Oyabun, you won't mind this? I shall leave this to you. Well then, I won't mind either. Thank you very much. Let's go to a different room, then. I was so surprised when the big Oyabun came out. Your pistol was more surprising. Where'd you get it from? I thought you were bluffing again. Congratulations. Now, let us all celebrate this agreement. Congratulations. So, Asakichi, you're going back to Osaka after this, right? I have a favor to ask of you. I want to send her to Anjoya and get her a respectable occupation. I can't allow that, Asakichi. Since I'm the one mediating this quarrel, I'll also be taking care of her. You two must be lovers, am I right? No, this... Don't make excuses. Let's do this, then. I shall give you a free week. Use that for outings, sightseeing, and then come back. Yes. It's a promise, then. You better not break this promise. I am nothing like Silk Hat, do you hear me? I have 2.000 henchmen. Bro, you don't have to return her to Innoshima. You should never go there again. Let's run away. Alright? Think carefully during this week and decide. - Here you are! - We're so relieved that you're safe. Is she Kotoito? Yes, she is. It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm his wife, Okinu. She is the daughter of the house where you hid before, behind Yoshioka's. I see. I'm glad you were safe and sound. I'm sure your mother will be happy. Very well, everything is settled now. Bro, can I go out with Oteru? Sure. Alright, so see you, then. Cheer up, Kotoito. Thank you. Shall we go, then? Bro, we're leaving... - If you excuse us now. - I'll see them off. What's wrong? I didn't know you have a wife. I don't know why I went through all that trouble to escape. I'll go back to Innoshima. You don't have to go back. No... but... How about going to Tokyo, then? It's nice there. I will speak to the Innoshima Oyabun for you. Right? Before that, let's go sightseeing in Nara and Kyoto. You've never been to Kyoto, right? Are you guys going to Kyoto and Nara? That's fantastic! Enjoy your trip. What, you were listening? You should come, too. Are you sure about that? Yeah. Thank you, Asakichi. I decided to go back to Tokyo. That's a good decision. Will everything be okay with Innoshima? Don't worry about that. You can go to Tokyo from here. Okinu, can you take her to the station? Sure. Well then, I'm off to Innoshima. I see. Kotoito. Be happy. Please stay strong. You too, Asakichi. I'm going now. You rarely find such a good person like him. So, please cherish him well. I will. You are a good match for him. That's different from our promise. I'm sorry. You know what a promise means to us, don't you? Yes. What do you mean, "yes"? You came back to rebel against me, Ito Aso? No way. I don't mean that. To be honest, I came here to get permission from you... You moron! You thought you could look down on me because I'm a woman? I don't mean that. I won't hear any excuses. Do you know what happens if you go against me? Go out with me. Come! Kneel right there. You're going to take hits from this cane until you cough blood. Are you up for it? Sure. Please punish me as you see fit. Good. I like your guts. You fool. Why'd you come back? Enough with your foolishly honest act. Beg for mercy. Say you give up. I won't, even if it kills me. What's with this attitude? Whether you are right or I am, my body will be the judge of that. You bastard. Enough with your bullshit. Let's see who breaks first, your cane or my body? How dare you? I will not give up even if I die. I have lost to you. You'll become a good man. You'll make a name for yourself. If you can get up, take this cane and go home. We're even now. I won't let you lay a finger on Kotoito anymore. I'll make a name for myself? Yeah, right. It would only be a bad reputation, anyway. I didn't do this for any of that. You fool! I won. Okinu, Sada, Kotoito... I... I... I won. I won. I won! THE END
