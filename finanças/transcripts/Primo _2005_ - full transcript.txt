It was my good fortune to be deported to Auschwitz only in 1944, that is, after the German government decided, - owing to the growing scarcity - Of labor, To lengthen the average life span of the prisoners destined for elimination. I had been captured by the Fascist Militia on the 13th of December, 1943, as a member of a small partisan band affiliated with the Resistance. During the interrogation, I preferred to admit to the status of "Italian citizen of Jewish race." I believe that any admission of my political activity would have meant torture and certain death. I was 24, with little wisdom, no experience, and a tendency, encouraged by the life of segregation forced on me by the racial laws, to live in an unrealistic world of my own. I was at first sent to the detention camp at Fossoli. Then, on the 21st of February, 1944, we learned that all the Jews without exception, would be leaving the next day. Our destination? No one knew. We should just prepare ourselves for travel. - The following morning, - We were taken To the station at Carpi. Here the train was waiting for us, with our escort for the journey. And here we received the first blows. It was so new and senseless that we felt no pain, only amazement. How can one man hit another without anger? Here, then, before our very eyes, and now under our very feet, - was one of those - Transport trains That we'd often heard about exactly like this, detail for detail: goods wagons, doors securely locked, holding a cargo of men, women, and children. Only this time, it is us inside. We had learned of our destination with relief. Auschwitz, a name without significance for us, at that time. Some thought it was Austerlitz, the town in Bohemia, but at least it implied some place on this earth. The train traveled slowly with long, unnerving halts. Through the air slit, we saw the tall, pale cliffs of the Adige valley and the names of the last Italian cities disappear behind us. At noon on the second day, we passed the Brenner Mountains, the frontier with Austria, and everyone stood up, but no one said a word. During the daytime our nerves, our fear, somehow made it all tolerable... The hunger, the thirst, the violated modesty, because of the absence of toilets. But the hours of darkness were like never-ending nightmares. Again and again sleep was interrupted by noisy and futile arguments, curses, cries, kicks and punches delivered blindly. And then someone would light a candle and its little flicker would show a strange human mass spread over the floor, sluggish, aching, rising in sudden convulsions, collapsing again. Through the slit, the names of Austrian cities: Salzburg, Vienna, Then Czech. Finally Polish names. On the evening of the fourth day, the cold became intense. The train ran through interminable black pine forests, climbing perceptibly. There was a long halt in the open country. Then we started up again, very slowly. Then stopped again for the last time, in the dead of night, in the middle of a dark, silent plain. By the light of our last candle, - and with the rhythm - Of the wheels And every human sound now silenced, we waited for what would happen. - It's sudden. - The door opens with a crash, And the dark echoes with that curt, barking noise of Germans in command. A huge platform appears before us, lit by reflectors. Beyond it, a row of lorries. Then everything goes silent again. Someone whispers a translation: "Climb down. Leave your luggage alongside the train." In a moment, the platform is swarming with shadows. A dozen SS men stand around, faces blank. - At a certain moment - They suddenly move among us, And with quiet voices, begin to ask questions in bad Italian. "How old?" "Healthy or ill?" "Job?" And depending on the reply, they point in two different directions. PRIMO: very silent, Everything is still silent as an aquarium, or certain dreams. We expected something more apocalyptic, but they're behaving so calmly, so reassuringly. They're just like people doing everyday jobs. One of us dares to ask for his luggage. They reply, "Luggage afterwards." Someone else doesn't want to leave his wife. They say, "Together again afterwards." Many mothers don't want to be separated from their children. They say, "Good, good, stay with child." In less than 10 minutes, all the men who are fit or professional specialists have been grouped together. What's happening to the others? We can't work it out. We see them for a moment, an indistinct mass at the other end of the platform, and then the night swallows them up, purely and simply. - - We're loaded onto a lorry. The lorry races off at full speed. It's pitch black in here. Are we unguarded? Should we jump out? - Too late. - There is a guard with us, A German soldier bristling with weapons. He switches on a pocket torch. We're expecting shouts and threats, but instead he starts asking us, very courteously in German and in pidgin, if we have any money or watches to give him, since we won't be needing them anymore. This isn't an order or a rule, - just the small - Private initiative Of our Charon. It makes us angry. It makes us laugh. It brings some relief. The lorry stops. A gate. Above it, a sign, brightly lit: "Arbeit Macht Frei." Work makes you free. The image still comes in my dreams. We're herded into an enormous, empty room. Poorly heated. We have a terrible thirst. We've had nothing to drink for four days. We see a tap, a dripping tap. Above it a card, "Wassertrinken verboten." It is forbidden to drink. Nonsense. This card's a joke. They know we're dying of thirst, - so they put us in this room, - With this tap, And "Wassertrinken verboten." I ignore it and drink. I spit it out. It's tepid, sweetish, stinking like a swamp. Hell must be like this: A big empty room, a tap which drips, but you can't drink from it, us tired, standing, waiting for something to happen, which will certainly be terrible. But nothing happens. Nothing continues to happen. Just time passing. The door opens, and an SS man enters, smoking. Looks at us slowly. Asks, "Wer kann Deutsch?" One of us, a man named Flesch, steps forward. He'll be our interpreter. The SS man makes a long, calm speech. Flesch translates. We must form rows of five, with intervals of two yards between man and man. We must undress and make a bundle of our clothes. We must take great care that our shoes are not stolen. Stolen by whom? Why should our shoes be stolen? And what about our documents, our watches, the things in our pockets? Flesch translates our questions to the German. The German smokes and looks through him as if he's transparent, as if no one had spoken. I've never seen old men naked. Mr. Bergmann wears a truss and asks Flesch if he should take it off. The German answers in a serious tone, pointing at someone else. Flesch translates. You can tell the words are bitter in his mouth. "The officer says, yes, take off your truss and you'll be given that of Mr. Coen." Ah. The German sense of humor. - Now four men burst in - With razors, - Soap brushes and clippers. - They wear striped trousers - And jackets, With numbers sewn on the front. We ask many questions, - but they just - Catch hold of us like sheep And in a moment we're sheared and shaved. Without hair our faces are weird, quite comical. They've cut off all our body hair too. We are more than stripped bare now. We are as naked as worms. Another door is opened, and we're herded into a shower room. - We're locked in. Here we are now, naked, sheared, and alone. We slowly start to speak. Everyone has questions, no one has answers. If we're going to have a shower, - does that mean that they're - Not going to kill us? But why do they keep us standing here? Why give us nothing to drink? Hunger exhausts but thirst enrages. As we're walking up and down, talking, talking, the SS man suddenly returns. Flesch translates, biting back his words again. "The officer says you must be quiet, this is not a rabbinical school." The SS man goes. We are silent. Does this mean it's morning? We can hear the dark, still camp waking up. Suddenly water gushes out from the showers. Boiling water. Oh, five minutes of bliss. - Then suddenly - We're being chased again, And shouting people throw striped rags at us, and shoes with wooden soles. And now we're out in the open, in the icy blue snow of dawn, barefoot, naked, our clothing in our hands. And now we're in another hut, and finally we're allowed to get dressed. When we're finished, everyone stays in his corner. We dare not lift our eyes. There are no mirrors, yet our reflection is here in front of us. A hundred bald white faces, a hundred sordid puppets. Nothing belongs to us anymore. They've taken away our clothes, our shoes, even our hair. If we speak they will not listen, if they listen, they will not understand. Think of the value of your smallest possessions, the possessions which even a beggar owns. A letter, a photo, just a handkerchief. These things are part of us. It's inconceivable to be robbed of them. Think of this. And then you can fully understand the term, "extermination camp." Hour after hour, this first long day of limbo passes. It's sunset before they finally drive us out of the hut again. Will they give us something to drink now? No. They lead us onto a big square in the center of the camp, and arrange us, meticulously, in squads. We wait for another hour. Then, near the gate, a little band starts playing. That song. So well-known, so sentimental, so strange here. We look at one another, and start sniggering. Maybe all this is just some colossal farce in the Teutonic style. Then we see other squads appearing, returning from somewhere. Squads of puppets, like us, but stiff, made of bones without joints, walking with a hard, unnatural gait, strictly in time to the band. When the last squad has arrived, they count us, and they recount us, for over an hour. Finally, it's dark by now, but the camp is brightly lit by lamps and reflectors. Finally, a German voice bellows, "Absperre." And the squads break up. We wander among the crowd, searching for a friendly face, a guide. Two boys are seated against the wall of a hut. They seem very young. Sixteen, maybe. One of them asks me, in German, where we come from. "Wir sind Italiener," I reply. I want to ask him many things, but my German is very limited. I try. "How long here?" He answers, "Three years." I'm shocked. He must have arrived as a child. Still, it means that some survive here. He asks what my work is. "Ich Chemiker." He grins. "A chemist is good." So. There's hope. He asks where my mother is now. I explain as best I can. She's fled from home, she's in hiding. He understands. He gets up, approaches, and embraces me timidly. The encounter is over. I'm filled with an odd, calm sadness. It's almost like joy. - I've never seen him again, - That boy, But I can't forget his face. The serious and gentle face of a child who welcomed me into the house of the dead. We've been baptized. The operation was slightly painful, extremely quick. But now we'll carry this here till we die. I am 174517. Only by showing this can I get bread and soup. Several days passed, and quite a few blows, before we got used to showing it promptly enough. Weeks were needed to learn its sound in the German language. Hundert Vierund-siebzig Funf Hundert Siebzehn. And at first, while the habits of freedom still made me look for the time on my wristwatch, my new name appeared instead. One-hundred and seventy-four thousand five-hundred and seventeen. We are the high numbers, the novices. We learn the rules of the Lager, the camp, as quickly as possible. Never ask questions, always answer "Jawohl," always pretend to understand. We learn to scavenge, anything useful. Wire to tie up shoes, rags to wrap round feet, waste paper to pad jackets against the cold. We also learn, that everything can be stolen. In fact, is automatically stolen if you look away for a second. - So when you go to the latrine - Or washrooms, Take everything along and while you wash your face, hold your belongings tightly between your knees. And we learn the art of sleeping with our head on a hard bundle, our jacket wrapped round everything we own, from food bowl to shoes. Ah. Shoes. Death begins with your shoes. Your wooden-soled shoes. At first they're like instruments of torture. After a few hours marching you already have painful sores. These quickly become infected. And then you're forced to walk with a kind of shuffle, as if dragging a convict's chain. This is the strange gait of the army which returns each evening on parade. If the sores get worse, your feet swell, - and the more they swell - The more the friction With the wood becomes unbearable. Then only the infirmary is left, but to enter the infirmary with a case of "dicke Fusse"... Swollen feet. Is extremely dangerous, since it's well-known to all, especially the SS, that there's no cure for that complaint. Not here. In the Lager, the average life expectancy of a high number is about eight weeks. If you last longer, it's because you've mastered two things. One, you've learned to obey orders in a language that you don't understand. Two, you have a pair of shoes that fit. And then there's the Auschwitz hunger. It's unknown to free men. It makes you dream cruel dreams at night, and settles in all your limbs by day. You and hunger become the same thing. Already my body is no longer mine. My belly is swollen, my limbs emaciated, my face hollow. Some of us have yellow skin, some grey. When we don't meet for a few days, we hardly recognize one another. Someone I seek out constantly is Alberto. We're about the same age, we're both chemists, we have the same build, we even look alike. - In fact, - People get us confused, And we're just known as "the two Italians". But I'm not adapting as well as Alberto. No one is. He understood before any of us that existence in this place is war. He fights for his life, yet he makes no enemies. He knows who to avoid, who to cultivate, who to corrupt. But... And this is what makes his memory still so dear to me. He himself never became corrupt. I always saw, and still see in him, the rare figure of the strong yet peace-loving man, against whom the weapons of night are blunted. No, honestly, - I don't feel - That today's companion, My work partner, will turn out to be an enemy. He is Null Achtzen. He's not called anything but that, Null Achtzen. Zero Eighteen, the last three figures of his number. I think even he's forgotten his real name. When he speaks, when he looks round, it's like he's empty inside. Like the slough of certain insects you find on river banks, just held by a thread to the stones. As we come back, again from the store, hands empty of the last load, feet dragging, there it is, the stack of cast-iron supports, the Kapo, the chief of our commando, with his whip. Two other prisoners lift a support and put it roughly on our shoulders. This time it's my turn to walk in front. The support is heavy but very short, and I keep feeling Null Achtzen's feet tread on mine. He's unable to walk in step, and the load is badly placed, something isn't right. A cable to step over, the store in sight, just a few more paces, but I can't take this. I shout, I start to turn, just in time to see Null Achtzen throw down his end. I land on the ground, blind with pain. A corner of the iron has cut across the back of my foot. For a moment everything's blank and giddy. Then the Kapo arrives. I receive only two blows to the head, the kind that do no real harm, simply stun. He makes me stand. So the bone isn't broken so the incident is closed. He leaves. I dare not take off the shoe to see the damage. The foot would swell, and I wouldn't get the shoe back on again. During the return march I can't really keep up. Luckily, there's no roll call this evening so now I'm back in the hut. Because of the march the pain is very bad again, along with a strange feeling of humidity. I take off the shoe. It's full of blood. Congealed into the rags I use as a foot pad. Tomorrow, instead of work, I'll have to go to Ka-Be. Ka-Be is the Krankenbau, the infirmary. And so, in the morning, after reveille, I join a long queue in one corner of the square, all the others presenting themselves for examination today. Someone comes and collects my things for safekeeping: bowl, spoon, beret, gloves. When he's gone, the others laugh. I've just been robbed. Didn't I know I should hide my things while in Ka-Be, or better still, trade them? They look at my number and shake their heads. Only a high number could be so stupid. They count us. We wait. They make us undress. They take our shoes. We shower. We wait. An SS man walks past, doing a brief survey. They count us again. We shower again. We wait. We wait. To judge by the sun, it's now about 2 p.m. We've been on our feet for 10 hours, naked for six. At last, a doctor. The examination is very fast. He says, A hundred yards away is Block 23. Inside they give me a long shirt, and I'm assigned bunk number 10. It's empty. A miracle! For the first time since I entered the Lager, I have a bunk to myself. Within moments, I'm fast asleep. The life of Ka-Be is a life of limbo. Reveille is at 4 a.m., as always, and you have to rise and wash, but there's no hurry and little severity. When the bread is distributed at 5:30, they can hear, far from the windows, in the dark air, the band beginning to play. The healthy comrades are leaving for work, marching like automatons. Their souls are dead, and the music drives them like the wind drives dead leaves. At the departure and at the return, the SS are never absent. Who would deny them the right to watch this choreography? It is their great creation, the dance of the dead men. They are engraved in my mind, those innocent songs. - They are the last thing - About the Lager I will ever forget. I have two neighbors in the next bunk. One is Walter, a Dutchman, civilized and well-mannered. - He sees that I have nothing - To cut my bread with, So he loans me his knife. I ask, "What are you suffering from, Walter?" "Organic decay." The worst type of disease, he tells me calmly, because it can't be cured. And it's very dangerous to enter Ka-Be with a disease that can't be cured. I still have confused ideas about this kind of danger. Everyone talks of it, but indirectly, by allusion. I ask Walter if it's true what one hears of selections, of gas, of crematoria. - Suddenly Walter's neighbor - Wakes up. - "Crematoria? - Who's talking of such things? Can't a sleeping man be left in peace?" He is a Polish Jew. His name is Schmulek. He tries to speak German but really only has Yiddish. "So der Italianer doesn't believe in the danger." He points to my number: 174517. Do I see 174516 other prisoners in the camp? "Where are the others?" "Perhaps transferred to other camps?" Schmulek shakes his head and looks at Walter. He doesn't want to understand. But destiny ordered that I would understand and soon enough. That evening, the door of the hut opens, and two SS men enter. The officer has a switch in his hand. - He speaks - To the chief doctor, - Who shows him - The register, Pointing here and there. The officer makes notes in a book, and then begins to walk, nonchalantly, between the bunks. You can hear his steps as if the hut is empty. Now he is looking at my neighbors, Walter and Schmulek. He brings out his book. I can see it all clearly from above. He draws a cross beside Schmulek's number and moves on. I look at Schmulek, but then see Walter's eyes, so I ask nothing. The next day, two groups of patients are led out. - The first are those - That have recovered, And they've been shaved and showered. The second leave just as they are, with long hair, without a shower. And no one gives them messages for comrades in the rest of the camp. Schmulek is among this group. So in this discreet and composed manner, without display or anger, a massacre moves through the huts of Ka-Be every day. After 20 days in Ka-Be, when my wound was practically healed, I was discharged. To my great displeasure. You leave naked again. You're given new clothes, new shoes. You have to try to adapt to these very quickly, just like at the beginning. Your trousers are falling down, your shirt has no buttons and your shoes hurt. This is how I am when the nurse, after endless administrative rites, finally assigns me to my new hut: Block 45. But I am in luck. This is Alberto's block. My friend Alberto. Alberto and Primo. "The two Italians." We now enter into a tight bond of alliance. Every scrap of food that we find, outside the ration, we will divide this into two strictly equal parts. Here in the Lager, each of the Haftlinge, the prisoners, is alone. Ferociously alone. But we will conduct an experiment, a chemical experiment in a way. Is there not more strength in two? At the moment, in this place, our only purpose is to reach the spring. We care about nothing else. In the mornings, while we wait endlessly on the roll-call square, the rising of the sun is always a big topic. Today a little earlier than yesterday, today a little warmer. In a month, the cold will call a truce, and we'll have one enemy less. This morning the sun rose bright and clear from the horizon of mud. It's a Polish sun, cold, distant, white, barely warming the skin, but when it dissolved the morning mist, a murmur ran through our numbers. said old Ziegler. "The worst is over." When we marched off to work, the sun was quite high and the sky serene. Later, we could see the mountains, the Carpathians, and to the west the town of Auschwitz, with its steeple... A steeple here? And all around the barrage balloons. For the first time we noticed that on either side of the road, the meadows were green. Green. - We look around - Like blind people Who've recovered their sight. We look at each other. We've never seen each other in sunlight. Someone smiles. If it was not for the hunger... But at midday, another surprise. In our work hut, we find a wonderful pot of soup, 11 gallons of it. It's from the factory kitchen where the civilians work, perhaps abandoned because it tastes slightly off. Templer looks at us triumphantly. This is his work. Templer is our Kommando's chief "organizer." That's the Lager word for fixer. And he has a wonderful nose for leftovers from the civilians. During the course of today, thanks to him, we will have six pints of soup each. What more could one want? Today is a good day. When Templer's turn comes, - it is agreed - That he should have 10 pints, And taken from the bottom of the pot. - For Templer is not only - A good fixer, But an exceptional soup eater, and for a special reason. He can empty his bowels at will, and this allows amazing gastric capacity. Of this gift, he is justly proud. To the accompaniment of handshakes and applause, he enters the latrine, - and comes out - A few moments later, Beaming and ready. Everyone cheers. A voice calls out, "You sure you made enough space for the soup?" At sunset, the siren of the Feierabend sounds, the end of work, and we are all satiated, at least for a few hours. No quarrels arise, the Kapo feels no urge to whip us, and we are able to think of our mothers and wives, which we don't usually do. For a few hours, we are able to be unhappy in the manner of free men. - The day they announced - The formation Of Kommando acht und neunzig, A chemical Kommando. About 15 Haftlinge gathered in the gray of dawn on the roll-call square, Alberto and I among them. The new Kapo was a very short man wearing a green triangle: a criminal prisoner. He made a speech in the crude German of the barracks. "So you are the chemists. "Well, I am Alex. - "And if you think, - Being intellectuals, "you can make a fool of me, a Reichsdeutscher, "a German of the Third Reich, "well, I'll show you. "Yes, and if any of you - "are applying - For these positions "without proper qualifications, "don't think you'll fool anyone. "An exam, ja Ihr Intelligenten, "a chemistry exam before the honored triumvirate "of Doctors Hagen, Probst und Pannwitz. "And now, meine herren, forward march." Although I never think of this for more than a few moments a day, I know that I'll end in the selections. I know that I'm not made of the stuff of those who survive them. I'm too civilized. I still think too much. I use myself up at work, all of myself. But if I can become a specialist, I might still save myself. And I can become a specialist, if I can just pass this chemistry exam. It'll be in German, obviously. That will be hard. A verbal exam, I presume, in front of these three Aryan doctors. Who will certainly see our filthiness, smell our odor. An office. A real office. Shining. Clean. Ordered. I would leave a stain on anything I touched. There's only one examiner present: Dr. Pannwitz. Tall, thin, blonde. Hair and nose like all Germans ought to have them. He finishes writing and looks up. Looks straight at me. - From that day - I've often thought about him, Dr. Pannwitz. What was he really like as a man? - How did he - Fill his time? I mean, outside of the Germanic ideology. When I was free again, I wanted to meet him. Not out of revenge. Just curiosity. For that look was not between two men. If I could explain completely the nature of that look, which seemed to come through the glass of an aquarium, between creatures who live in different elements, different worlds, I would also be able to explain succinctly the great insanity of the third Germany. Over in the corner, - that other - Zoological specimen, Alex, - Yawns and - Chews on something While the exam begins. "Wo sind Sie geboren?" Pannwitz addresses me as "Sie," the polite form. Yet, damn him, - he doesn't make - The slightest effort To speak a simpler kind of German. I tell him that I was born and raised in Turin, and I took my degree there in 1941. As I speak, I have the clear impression - of not being - Believed. Of not even believing myself. It's enough to look at my dirty hands covered with sores, my convict's trousers caked with mud. Yet I am he. From Turin. But now, as I continue to speak, it becomes easier to believe. - My knowledge of - Organic chemistry - Even after - So long a break Responds with unexpected ease and lucidity. And even more, this sense of elation. This excitement warm in my veins. I recognize it. I remember it. It's the fever of exams. My fever, my exams. It's that spontaneous mobilization of all my faculties and knowledge. My friends at university used to envy this. It's over. The excitement fades. I stare at the fair skin of his hand writing down my fate on a white page. The symbols are incomprehensible. Alex steps back into the picture. "Los, ab." For a moment I grope around for a suitable formula of leave-taking. But in vain. I know how to say "to eat," "to work," "to steal," "to die," in German. I even know how to say "sulfuric acid," "atmospheric pressure," "short-wave generator." But I do not know how to address a person of this importance. To get back into the main camp, you have to walk over an area littered with crossbeams and metal frames. Alex catches hold of a steel cable to climb over one obstacle and then curses: "Donnerwetter!" His hand is black with thick grease. Without hatred, without sneering, without even thinking, he wipes his hand... Both the palm and the back. On my shoulder. He would be amazed, poor brute, Alex, - if someone told him - That today, On the basis of that one action, I judge him. I judge you, Alex. And you, Dr. Pannwitz. I judge you. And all the others like you, big and small, in Auschwitz and everywhere. I judge you. We've done an exam but it brings no results. We're not surprised. Not particularly disappointed. "When things change, they change for the worse." This is one of the proverbs of the Lager. But then one day in June 1944, I was detailed - with two of - The civilian workers Stationed here. Bricklayers. One of them, tall, a bit stooped, with grey hair, spoke to me and I thought I was dreaming. He'd spoken in Italian and with a Piedmontese accent. In speaking to one another, we were committing a crime. But we spoke anyway and found out that he, Lorenzo, was from Fossano. And I have relatives in Fossano and Lorenzo knew them by name. I don't think we said much more to one another, then or later. Not because of the prohibition, but because Lorenzo hardly ever spoke at all. The story of my relationship with Lorenzo is both long and short, plain and enigmatic. It's almost like a fable. In concrete terms, he brought me some soup on the sly every day for six months. The soup had extra nourishment: plum pits, salami peel, once the wing of a sparrow. I shared the soup with Alberto, of course. And without it, we would not have survived. The Lager daily ration supplied us with about 1600 calories a day, which is not enough to live on while working. Lorenzo's soup added another four, five hundred. Alberto and I were amazed by Lorenzo. In the vicious and degraded world of Auschwitz, a man helping other men out of simple altruism? This was unimaginable. It was alien. He was a savior sent from heaven. But an odd savior. Catholic, yet not a believer. Silent, morose, often smelling of wine. Yet I believe that it is really due to Lorenzo that I am alive today. Not just for his material aid, but for constantly reminding me, just by his presence, his natural and plain manner of being good, that there still existed a just world outside our own. Something still clean and whole. Something difficult to define. But something worth surviving for. Yesterday the sun went down behind a confusion of dirty clouds, chimney stacks and wires. And today it is winter. We know what this means - because we were here - Last winter. And the others will soon learn. In the next few months, October to April, seven out of 10 will die. And those that don't will suffer minute by minute all day, every day. Just as our Auschwitz hunger is not that ordinary feeling of missing a meal, so our way of being cold has need of a new word. Only a new, harsh language could convey what it's like to work all day in the wind with the temperature below freezing, wearing only shirt, underpants, cloth jacket and trousers. And winter means something else too. Selekcja. That hybrid Polish and Latin word. At first it's heard once, twice. Now many times. Now in every single conversation. "Selekcja." Today is a working Sunday. Arbeit Sonntag. We work till midday, then return to the camp to shower, to have our weekly haircut and shave, to get the dustings for skin diseases and lice. Yet somehow everyone in the washrooms, in the huts, in the yards... Everyone knows that Selekcja will be today. The news comes, as always, surrounded by rumor. "It's already happened in Ka-Be this morning "and it was 50% of the patients. "At Birkenau, the crematorium chimney has been smoking for 10 days now." - The young - Tell the young - That only the old - Will be chosen. The healthy tell the healthy it will only be the ill. "Specialists will be excluded. "German Jews will be excluded. Low numbers will be excluded." You will be chosen and I will be excluded. It's early afternoon. The kitchens are working. The distribution of bread is starting up. Maybe we were wrong. Maybe this is just a day like any other day. But then... At dawn this means reveille, but if it rings during day, it means blocksperre. Enclosure in huts. - Our Blockaltester, - The block chief, - He knows his business, - All right. - When we're all in, - He locks the door, Hands everyone their card with number, name, profession, nationality, orders everyone to strip except for shoes, - and then - To wait like this, Naked, card in hand, for the commission to reach our hut. They're coming. - The Blockaltester - And his helpers Drive us into the Tagesraum, the quartermaster's office, The room's not large. When the drive is over, a human mass is jammed inside. Filling every corner. Putting such pressure on the wooden walls they creak. You have to hold up your nose to breathe. You must be careful not to crumple the card in your hand. Or, worse, lose it. There's no time, no room to be afraid. The feeling of warm flesh surrounding you is unusual and reassuring. The door opens. Ahead is a stretch of ground. Then another door back to the dormitory. Between these two doorways stands the arbiter of our fate: an SS subaltern. To his right, the Blockaltester. To his left, the quartermaster. Each of us, as he comes out naked, must run the few steps between the two doorways, hand his card to the SS man and return to the dormitory. In a fraction of a second, with a glance at your front and your back, the SS man will judge your fate and pass your card to one side or the other. And this will mean life or death. - It's my turn. - Like everyone, - I try to run With a brisk and elastic step. Try to hold my head high. My chest forward, my muscles contracted and conspicuous. I hand over my card. I run past. Out of the corner of my eye I try to look over my shoulder. I think my card went to the right. We're allowed to get dressed again. - No one knows - His own fate yet, - Because no one - Knows yet - If the - Condemned cards - Were on the left - Or the right. - By now, there's - No longer any point - In sparing - People's feelings. So we all crowd 'round the oldest, the most wasted-away. - If their cards - Went to the left, Then the left is certainly the side of the condemned. - It takes - 3 or 4 minutes To do a hut of 200 men. An afternoon for the whole camp. - But even - Before it's over, We know that it was the left. This was the schlechte seite. The bad side. There are, of course, some irregularities. Rene, for example, so young and robust. He's ended on the left. Perhaps because of his slight stoop. Perhaps just a mistake. One shouldn't be surprised by any mistakes. The examination is so quick and summary. - The crucial thing - For the Lager is not that The most useless prisoners be eliminated, but that free space be created quickly according to a certain percentage that's already been fixed. Everyone is scraping the bottom of their bowls with their spoons. A confused, metallic clatter. The end of the day. It lapses into silence. And then I hear old Kuhn praying aloud with his beret on his head, rocking backwards and forwards, backwards and forwards. Kuhn is thanking God because he's not been chosen. Is he out of his senses? Does he not see Beppo the Greek next to him? Beppo, who's 20 years old and is going to the gas chamber tomorrow and knows it - and lies there - Staring up at the light Without saying anything, without even thinking anymore. Does Kuhn not realize that next time it'll be his turn? Does he not understand that what happened here today is an abomination, which no prayer, no pardon, no apology, nothing in the power of man can ever wipe clean again? If I was God, I would spit at Kuhn's prayer. This morning as our Kapo, Alex, is dividing up the squads as usual, he says, "Dr. Pannwitz has communicated "to the Arbeitsdienst "that three Haftlinge "have been chosen for the laboratory. "169509, Brackier, "175633 Kandel, "174517, Levi." For a moment my ears ring, and the Lager whirls round me. There are a couple of Levis in our Kommando. But Hundert Vierund-siebzig Funf Hundert Siebzehn is definitely me. I have been chosen to enter the paradise of the laboratory. Alberto's the first to shake me by the hand. I have a ticket from the Arbeitsdienst in my pocket, saying that I am now a specialized worker, I have the right to a new shirt and underpants, and I must be shaved every Wednesday. No one can boast of understanding the Germans. The temperature in here. The thermometer reads 65 degrees Fahrenheit. We enter the laboratory, we three chosen ones, timid, suspicious, bewildered. Like three wild animals slinking into a big city. It is, incredibly, a laboratory like any other laboratory. A lab. The smell makes me reel back as if from the blow of a whip. That faint aromatic smell. For a moment, the large semi-dark room at university, my fourth year, the mild air of May in Italy, all of this comes back to me with a kind of violence. And instantly vanishes. I'm under shelter, I'm warm, no one beats me. I can steal and sell soap and petrol without risk. When I want to go out I only have to ask our supervisor, Herr Stawinoga, who never says no and never questions me if I delay. He calls me "Monsieur," which is ridiculous. And then there are the girls. How long since we saw girls? Here are three young Germans. They have smooth, rosy skin, beautiful clean clothes, long blond hair. Faced with these girls, we feel ourselves sinking into the ground. We know what we look like. We see one another all the time, and sometimes even see our own reflection in a clean window. And then there's our smell, of course. The girls call us Stink Juden. They talk among themselves, these girls, about the rationing, their fiancés, their families: - "Are you going home - On Sunday?" Asks Fraulein Meyer. "I'm not, traveling is so uncomfortable." "Oh it is," says another. "But I will go home for Christmas." "Christmas?" Exclaims Fraulein Meyer. "Only a few more weeks and Christmas again." "Yes," says the other. "Hasn't this year flown by?" This time last year I was a free man. I had a name, a family, an eager mind, a healthy body. Today I am not even alive enough to know how to kill myself. If I spoke better German, I would try to explain all this to Fraulein Meyer. - But she would certainly - Not understand, And if she did she would flee from me. Hasn't this year flown by? Tonight, as we return from work, they march us onto the big square. Is there to be a roll call? No. In the searchlight, we see the profile of the gallows. A raucous German voice rises out of the sudden quiet and speaks for a long time, angrily, into the dark air. Finally the condemned man is brought into the searchlight. Last month one of the crematoria in Birkenau was blown up. - None of us know - Exactly what happened. But there was talk of the Sonderkommando, the special Kommando attached to the gas chambers and ovens. Somehow, a group of these men, although slaves like us, had found it in themselves to act. The man in front of us this evening took part in some way. - At the end of the German's - Speech, Which no one followed, he bellows, "Have you understood?" - "Jawohl!" Who answered this? Everyone and no one. It's as if our resignation took body and became one big collective voice above our heads. But now each of us, alone in ourselves clearly hears the shout of the doomed man. It's a shout that pierces right through all our barriers of inertia and submission. "Comrades, I am the last one." I wish I could say that from the midst of us just one voice rose, or just a murmur, or just some tiny sign of assent. But nothing happened. - We remained standing there, - Bent and grey, Like cringing dogs. The trapdoor opened, the body wriggled horribly, the band began playing again, and we filed past the scaffold. The SS watched us pass with indifferent eyes. Their work was finished. It was said the Russians were getting nearer. Well, they could come now. There were no longer any strong men left among us. The only one was hanging above our heads. As for the rest of us, even if we've finally learned how to adapt here, to find food, to resist the fatigue and the cold. And even if we return home, the Germans have succeeded. To destroy a man is difficult, almost as difficult as to create one. It has not been easy or quick, but the Germans have succeeded. When Alberto and I got back to the hut, we couldn't look at one another. That morning at the end of December, when Lorenzo handed me his mess tin, it was bent out of shape, and the soup had pebbles and grit in it. He told me, almost as an apology, that the civilian camp had been hit in an air raid. A bomb had fallen close to him. It buried the mess tin and burst one of his eardrums. But he had the soup to deliver, and anyway had to come to work. He knew that the Russians were going to arrive, and he was afraid of them. "The barbaric Asiatic hordes," according to German propaganda. And he fled Auschwitz soon after. The Russians were certainly getting closer, only 50 miles away, rumor said. When, on the 11th of January 1945, I fell ill with scarlet fever, and was once more sent to Ka-Be. I had four peaceful days. Outside it was snowing but the room was heated. I was given strong doses of sulpha drugs. I was hardly able to eat, didn't want to talk. On the fifth day the barber came. One of the Greeks. When it was my turn I forced myself to get up. I asked him if there was any news. He stopped working, winked dramatically, and made a sweeping gesture towards the west. "Tomorrow everyone is leaving." Alberto and I had often discussed this possibility. The evacuation of the camp, and the dangers which might accompany it. In the afternoon, the doctor came, another Greek. He said that all the patients who could walk would be given shoes and clothes, - and they'd leave - With the healthy prisoners On the evacuation march. He was unusually cheerful. He seemed drunk. We asked what would happen to the rest of us. He thought the Germans would leave us to our own fate. No, he didn't think they'd kill us. We weren't convinced. His very cheerfulness was worrying. Now Alberto comes to my window, defying the prohibition, to say goodbye. We've been inseparable. For six months we've shared a bunk and every scrap of food that we've found outside the ration. He's very happy tonight. Everyone is who's leaving. Something great and new is about to happen. A force surrounding us that isn't Germany. We say goodbye through the window. - Not many words - Are needed. We've already discussed our affairs countless times. And anyway, we won't be separated for very long. All the healthy prisoners left during that night. About 20,000 of them. And they vanished. Except for very few. They vanished during the Todesmarsch that followed. The Death March. Alberto was among them. Meanwhile we remained in our bunks, alone with our illnesses, and our inertia, which was stronger than fear. For us began a series of days outside the world and time. January the 18th. The heating plant has been abandoned. In our hut some warmth lingers on, but hour by hour it fades. And outside it's five degrees Fahrenheit below zero. During the night we hear the roar of airplanes and another bombardment begins. Nothing new. Except this is closer. The camp itself has been struck. A nearby hut is burning fiercely. Dozens of patients arrive, crying for shelter. It's impossible to take them in. They keep trying, begging and threatening in many languages. We have to barricade the door. They drag themselves elsewhere, barefoot in the snow. Some trailing long bandages. The whole terrible scene brightly lit by flames. And then we notice something else. The towers are empty. The Germans are gone. Today few speak of providence. But in that moment some memory of biblical salvation swept like a wind through us. January the 19th. Two Frenchmen, Arthur, a farm worker, and Charles, a school teacher agree with me that we have to go out and search for a stove and fuel and food. What we see outside resembles nothing I've ever known. The Lager, barely dead, is already decomposing. No water, no electricity. Broken doors slamming in the wind. Loose iron sheets screeching on the roofs. Ashes from last night's fires drifting high and far. Grey, skeleton-like patients are dragging themselves over the frozen soil like an invasion of worms. Some of them have found potatoes and are roasting them on the embers of the bombed craters, glaring about with fierce eyes. We hurry to the kitchens. The potatoes are almost finished but we gather what we can, - and also find - What we're most hoping for: A cast-iron stove. We load this onto a wheelbarrow and steer it back to our hut. When the stove is lit and starts to spread its heat, and the potatoes are coming to the boil, something relaxes in us all. Towarowski, a young Franco-Pole stands and proposes that everyone offers a slice of bread to us three who've been working. And it's agreed. Just a day before, such a thing would've been inconceivable. The law of the Lager says, "Eat your own bread and if possible steal your neighbor's." So A human gesture between us again, the first one. The Lager really is dead. January the 21st. We've been watching the Wehrmacht in flight, passing by our windows. Armored cars, tiger tanks camouflaged in white, Germans on horseback, Germans on bicycles, Germans on foot. It looked like it would never end. But with sunrise today we realize that the plain is finally deserted and lifeless, white as far as the eye can see, lying motionless under a flight of ravens. Deathly sad. I feel so weak again. My scarlet fever is far from over. I want only one thing: To stay in bed, under my blankets, and abandon myself to sleep. But it really would be a pity to give in now. January the 23rd. Our potatoes are finished. But we've heard that an enormous trench of them lies just outside the camp. A section of the barbed wire has already been opened. Charles and I step through, into the wind of the plain. Charles says, "Dis donc, Primo, on est dehors." Yes, it's exactly that. For the first time since my arrest, I am free. Further on, we find the treasure: Two long ditches filled with potatoes, these covered with layers of soil and straw to protect them from the cold. An old man, a Hungarian prisoner, has been surprised here by death. He lies on the ground like the personification of hunger, face and belly in the snow, hands outstretched toward the potatoes. Well, nobody will die of hunger anymore. January the 26th. It is Somogyi's turn. A Hungarian chemist, on the upper bunk, aged about 50, suffering from both typhus and scarlet fever. Today he gives way to delirium, and this goes on for a long time. Caught in some terrible last dream of slavery, he begins to murmur "Jawohl" with every breath, regularly, like a machine. "Jawohl." "Jawohl." "Jawohl." Until you want to shake him, suffocate him. I've never understood so clearly how laborious the death of a man is. Eventually I sleep. The place is pitch black when I wake again. Silence. Somogyi is finished. He's somehow found the strength to throw himself to the floor. I think I heard the thud of his hips and head. Well, we can't carry him out now. Nothing for it. Go back to sleep. January the 27th. Dawn. On the floor, the shameful wreck of skin and bones, the Somogyi thing. We have no clean water to wash ourselves, so we dare not touch him till after we've cooked and eaten. The living are demanding, the dead can wait. It's midday when we finally carry him out to the common grave. He's very light, and since the pit is full, we overturn the stretcher onto the defiled snow. Charles takes off his beret. I regret not having one. And while we're standing here the Russians arrive. Four soldiers on horseback, slowly appearing between the grey of the snow and the grey of the sky. Four men armed, but not against us. Four messengers of peace. They're very young, with rough boyish faces under heavy fur hats, perched on their enormous horses. They don't greet us, they don't smile. They seem overwhelmed, not just by compassion but something else, something that seals their lips and keeps their eyes fixed to the scene around them. It's shame. We know this shame. It's the shame that swamped us after the selections, and every time we had to watch, or submit to some outrage. It's the shame which the just man feels at another man's crime. A feeling of guilt that such a thing even exists. This is why few of us ran to greet our saviors, few knelt in prayer. Charles and I remained standing beside the pit overflowing with discolored limbs, while others began to break down the barbed wire. And then we returned with the empty stretcher to break the news to our companions.
