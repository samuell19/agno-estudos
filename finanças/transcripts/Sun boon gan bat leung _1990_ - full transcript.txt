I can't help even if I want to! Mr. Leung, I've been living on nothing! I can't even afford fishfood! There's two left, so have one each! Next month, I... You bastard, you ate them both! You left nothing for your kid brother? This fish so naughty... You know I'm broke! You naughty fish! The fish is innocent. Don't beat it. Give me an extra month or a week. Darling, I know you're hungry. Give me a kiss... I'll feed you later. Your brother is very naughty. Give me one more month. I can do it! You ate all the food. Times are hard! And there's no more food! Do you want my bread? I've got to eat too! This is awful. Boss, since we're all hungry, Let's steam the fish. Okay, at least we won't starve! No! They look so sad! At least we won't starve! Don't do it! They're only selfish, stupid fish! Ok, you get one more month, I'll feed the fish for you! Thanks. Mr. Leung. You're so kind. What's wrong with you, Mr.Hui? Everybody's talking about Anita seeing a ghost. You showed her with her dog, who cares! We're interviewing her again tonight... I heard the ghost is real, I'm going to take photos of it. Is there really a ghost? You'll find out in our next issue. That's more like it, Mr.Hui. Thanks, Mr. Leung, Drop in any time. Who looks more like a ghost, you or me? Wrap the fur coats up before loading them, Get the TV sets to Shekou by Monday, Cash on delivery, not a penny less. Okay! Boss, the film people are back, look! What nerve! They might attract the cops. Weren't they afraid of our ghost trick? Dragon, you'll be the ghost tonight. I'll scare the shit out of them, Anita, tell us about the ghost, It was horrible! Last week I was filming here, And saw something in that hedge, His hair was very long, He was wearing a long white robe. He had no feet! No feet? That's right! I was petrified! It was horrible! Oh... I nearly forgot. I was told that a woman was drowned by some villagers. Since then, the village has been haunted! Let's change the subject! Anita, what is it? The ghost... it's back! There's no ghost! It's just a white chimney. Let's go again! Help! A ghost! Great! Get the next car. Wait for me! Anita, this way. Wait for me! Hurry up and drive! So it's a wrap! Got it, Boss. We'll wait in the car, I'm innocent. I'm innocent too. They say I'm a whore! I know. They drowned me. A terrible death. Terrible. I'm lonely... I know. Let's go for a swim. I can't swim... Stay here. We'll go for a swim. Boss I can't swim. Don't want to go swimming? Boss, what are you doing? What, swimming? Boss, I got photos of the ghost. They're terrific! I saw that ghost, she's a whore! She was drowned and returns every night. Did you see her? We're the only 2 that didn't see a ghost! She wants to swim with me. Did you see her? Yeah, Yeah... Boss wants to know if you saw a ghost! - The camera! - Damn, the film got soaked! Really, He looked so funny. He ran like crazy and fell in this hole! Hello, Truth Weekly. It's the boss! Hmm... Oh... Okay... What did he say? He's sick and won't be in today. Do you think it's shock? Maybe. We'll go see him after work. No. If we go to his home, His wife will make you play mahjong. Don't play mahjong with them, they cheat! She lets her husband win! Last year they cheated me out of my bonus. I lost my money for a new pair of "Dr. Martins"! They really do that? I'll win it back. We'll have champagne for breakfast. How? Do you know my other nickname? What is it? Elvis the Pelvis! The King of Gamblers! Make yourself at home. Wow, looks like a gym! You're really into karate, aren't you? Yeah! Those stars you did, real cool! It was a trick, a phony toenail, see! It helps me make a living! But here's a secret. I'm practising something incredible. Come here... Hold it higher. This is the 'Shadowless Kick', I can move that bottle without touching it. Bruce Lee tried to perfect it, But he died before he succeeded. I don't think it moved. Shit! 3 years and it still doesn't work! One day I'll make it, The world will know about me. But this stuff won't make me rich I've been a salesman, and a taxi driver. They don't make money! But these will make a fortune. Try it on! Invisible ink and fluorescent lenses! Inspired by a movie I saw. "We'll play with the boss using this set," Then it'll be champagne for breakfast. That's great! Big money! But none of us is short-sighted, If we suddenly wear glasses, he'll suspect something! I have two pairs of contact lenses. Look, Red Chung... Green Fat. No problem! Why are your eyes green? The fluorescent goes green in the dark. It's okay as long as the lights are on. Hey. The fire drives out any evil in you. It's just a slight fever. God bless me. Boss, feeling better? It's just flu, I'm fine. Is the film ruined? It's fucked. The camera is broken too. Really! There goes our super cover! The company's gonna close down. Help me think of something. Sit down, they're here. Hey, Fly, thanks for coming. This is our new colleague, Mad Bill. How are you, Mrs. Hui? Fine, fine. We brought you a present, a mahjong set! A new mahjong set. Great! Let's play. Let's play. I have a fever, I can't play. This plug doesn't work properly. Is it on now? I'm cooking some congee. We're gonna make a killing! Nine Bamboo. Mind the Circles, I'm not scared. Let's see! Just what I needed! What a coincidence! Why don't you go with Circles! Not if I have to pay everyone. Three Million! It's double if I win! Seven Million! You want Eight Circles? I don't think you want Two Circles! Be careful - or you'll pay all! Your turn. It's worth the risk! I guess so... Do you want Six Circles? How about Four Circles? You're Brave! Carry on, my brave man! Show your guts... Try another Circle! You'll pay all if you lose! Nine Circles! That's a high risk card! Great! Now you lose! Hang on, boss... sorry, I called before you. $256, pay up. Do you know how to play mahjong? Do you know how to play? Dummy! I... don't play so well! Even a fool knows he's looking for 9 Circles. You blind bat, it's obvious! You drive me crazy I'll be damned! The fuse is out again! You overloaded the circuit again. Get out; you don't know where the fuse is! I'll do it! You? What do you know other than mahjong! I always fix it. Get lost! You'll start a fire one day! What's wrong with their eyes? How should I know? Their eyes are green? Are they possessed? Maybe it's the ghost from last night! No way! Quick, pretend we're possessed! The water is freezing... I'm not an adulteress. Why did you drown me? I'm suffering... Let's go for a swim! The water is so cold, so cruel... Let's play... come on! Hurry over here, darling! I want the stake raised... five times. And play for cash! Hurry up! Cash? Do you have any cash? Is this enough? You're going to win with One Bamboo, If you do, you'll bleed to death, darling! It's not One Bamboo, I haven't won. Then carry on. A Full Suit! $2,048, darling! And $1,024 from you, dear! Play and pay! Good morning, boss. Walk over the fire first. Hello, Mr. Leung, how are the goldfish? I know... but I need two more weeks... I'll have the cheque ready on the 14th.
