Also starring Roy Clark and special guest star Wayne Rogers. (audience applauding) - Spring Spring Spring. Hi, did you feel a funny, kind of a stirring inside of you about a week ago? I don't want you to go to the doctor for a checkup. You see that was the first day of Spring. I think everyone can kind of sense when it's Spring without calendars or without Spring sales, or even without groundhogs. Some people know it's Spring because they just forget their problems and feel like falling in love. Of course, their husbands and wives aren't too pleased about it, but then others get an irresistible urge to dig down deep and pay their income tax. They're weird. Then there's this unexplained behavioral phenomenon that happens to kids in the Spring. It's called fanny fatigue and it hits them right in the classroom. Lots of people get an urge to clean house or to travel or to get in shape. And me, how do I know deep down inside when it's Spring? Well, it's simple. 'Cause Spring makes me feel like ♪ Dancing dancing dance the night away ♪ ♪ I feel like dancing dancing ♪ ♪ Dance the night away ♪ (upbeat music) ♪ You've got a cute way of talking ♪ ♪ You've got the better of me ♪ ♪ Just snap your fingers and I'm walking ♪ ♪ Like a dog hanging on your lead ♪ ♪ I'm in a spin ya know ♪ ♪ Shaking on string you know ♪ ♪ You make me feel like dancing ♪ ♪ I wanna dance the night away ♪ ♪ You make me feel like dancing ♪ ♪ I wanna dance the night away ♪ ♪ You make feel like dancing ♪ ♪ I feel like dancing dancing ♪ ♪ Dance the night away ♪ ♪ I feel like dancing dancing ♪ - One, two, one, two, three (upbeat music) Whoo!

If you still have a nose after last winter. Do you believe that winter that we had? We visited my husband's folks in Minneapolis and we were greeted with a chill factor of 80 degrees below zero.

Oh I could go to a party and take one jelly bean and make it last all evening long. But then during the Christmas holidays I began to notice a change. Jelly beans just didn't satisfy me. - You switched to the heavy stuff too, huh? Like Roman butter toffees and maybe a little root beer chaser. And how about a butterscotch for the road? - Right. But then in the morning that hangover. - I see what you mean. - Well, people were beginning to notice too. Like my girl, Lucy Anne, she came up from Nashville. And instead of saying, honey, is that you all? She said, honey, is that all you? - Oh how humiliating. I went shopping for a fur coat, you see, and I told the salesman that I wanted something that was really me. And he brought me a broad tail. - I see what you mean. And the terrible part is you lose complete control. I couldn't stay away from bars. - Hershey bars and Clark bars and Mars bars. - And finally some Twinkie feet turned me into the AE. - That's appetite's enormous. My own husband turned me in. I was picked up in a raid on 31 Flavors with hot fudge on my breath and a mocha chip on my shoulder. - It was awful. I was ordered to cut down to one slice of meat a day. One slice! But how large a slice? I decided to be sensible. So I purchased me a sensible slice of meat and brought it home, strapped to the fender of my car. - Well, it's Spring and it's all come down to this. - Yes, time to stop letting out my guitar strap and trying to find my lap. - Time to pick up my bikini and drop the fettuccine.

'Cause I love, first of all I love the parades and I love the fantastic food and I can just see my Hungarian grandmother in the kitchen. She was always stirring up something special to eat. - It must've stirred up Grandpa too. - We used to have this big Easter breakfast and she made absolutely marvelous Palacsintas. It's where you'd take some dough and you take some goodies huh? And you stuff it in the dough, right? And you roll it up and if you're German, it's pfannkuchen and if you're Hungarian it's called palacsinta. - Well, if you are French like my mom, we call it ze crepe. - That's it, sure you got it.

The sigh of a new zipper (zipping). The click of a new snap. The whistle of a husband as he reads the price tag. He'll get over it.

The yearly surge of the urge to converge. In the past, we haven't paid too much attention to animal love relationships. Why? Well, I don't know. But speaking for myself I've had all I could do just to handle my own. But now through new scientific methods our knowledge has broadened considerably. That's true. For instance, did you know that the female black widow spider often becomes extremely irritated at her male lover? Hence the term bug off? Now where did science learn so much about animal mating habits? Where else? At a place we're going to right now, an animal singles bar. Come on. Welcome to Wally's Watering Hole. The in place for the beautiful animal crowd. How you doing Wally? I'll have my usual. Thank you. Evening Miss Giraffe. - That's giraffe-ay darling. - Oh, I'm sorry.

Chasing them, trying to impress them. - You still do that? Not me. I just loaf around home and chew on the finest hay. And a guy I know trots a cute little filly into my stall and we get to know each other. - Wow why didn't I ever hear about this? You think the guy could line up a deal like that for me? - Well, sure, all you gotta do is convince him that you're a thoroughbred horse and not a skunk. (audience laughing) ♪ Monkey's and big chimpanzees do it ♪ - Pardon me, aren't you a female chimpanzee? - Yes I am. - Well good, I'm a man. You say the secret word and you win a banana daiquiri. - Huh? - That's the word. What should we drink to as if we both didn't know. - Listen darling, I want you to get the one thing straight. I don't swing. - Oh yeah? Well, who cares. You do monkey around a little don't you? - That's very funny. ♪ Penguins in black tie and tails do it ♪ - Yeah, well do you know how frustrating it is? You're an Eagle, I'm a penguin. - Yeah, but I can imagine how embarrassing it must be to be short and fat and waddle around looking ridiculous. - Watch it big bird, that isn't it at all. I just can't stand the Spring mating season. Night after night bringing lady penguins up to my apartment, wining them, dining them, getting them all worked up and then not being able to get this doggone tuxedo off. ♪ See salmon swimmin' upstream do it ♪ - It's a quarter to three, ain't any salmon here except you and me. - Just my luck. The only other salmon in the place and he's poached. - Baby, I'm glad to find you.
