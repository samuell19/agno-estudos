[ Muttering ] ! command you to lay down your arms, or ! will open fire! [ Gasps ] [ Dutch Sailor] Fire! - [Alberto ] ! Fuego! - [ Gunfire Commences ] [ Man ] Now let us all think hard... and see if we can remember anything else. When you were on board that ship, did anybody do anything to frighten you? Were you frightened? - Who of? - All those men. Did they ever do anything that you, uh... you didn’t like? Well, you know what I mean. Something nasty. Hmm? He talked about our... drawers. - Who? - The captain. Why? What did he say about your drawers? He said he wouldn‘t mend them. He said not to slide down the deck on them. He shouldn’t have talked about drawers. Margaret, did he ever make any... suggestions? He was totally brave. - What did he do? - He ate a whole spoonful of pepper. - A big spoon. - And he didn‘t cry. Yes. I see. Did you see any fighting... any guns... or knives? - No. - They wouldn‘t let us. Not even when the Dutch ship was captured? - You know, the paddle steamer. - No. We were shut up. All except Emily. She was in the cabin. Captain’s cabin? With Chavez? Now, John—- John. Your brother. Have you any idea what happened? Papa. Papa, can I go home now? They've had enough. After all the experiences of these last few weeks... they're still suffering terribly from shock. - Mr. Thornton, a brief word. - They've had enough. [All Chattering ] Mr. Thornton. Mr. Thornton, a brief word with you. You realize, without their help, we may fall to get a conviction. Is it your opinion that they really know nothing? Or have they been terrorized into hiding something? No. No, I don’t think they've been terrorized... but they may know something they don’t say. VVhy? Because they may have formed an affection for this man Chavez. An affection? If they know anything, ! shall have to find it out. You mean put them in the box? Oh, not all of them, certainly. Heaven forbid. - We will have to produce at least one. - Which one? Emily. [ Barrister] These men plead guilty on the count of piracy. But since 1837 piracy has ceased to be a hanging offense... unless accompanied by murder... and in this case, either the murder of the boy, John Thornton... or Captain Vandervort. Now, ifyou decide that one of these men—- any one of these men—- is responsible for the deaths of the boy and Dutch captain... you are bound to convict them all! [ Spectators Murmuring ] Now, Emily, ! must continue to ask you a few questions. Remember that this morning you made a solemnoath to tell the truth. Because you took that oath, ! know thatyou will tell the truth. Now, please speak clearly, loudly... so that we can all hear. We've heard about this Dutch steamer. Now, a terrible thing has been suggested. It is said that the captain, after having his hands bound... went on the schooner with his crew... - and the captain was murdered. - [ Spectators Shouting ] Did you see any such thing happen? l-- l-- l-- I was asleep. Oh, weil—- [ Chuckling ] Emily, please. But this morning you said you were awake. Yes, because your leg was hurting you so much. He-- He gave me medicine to make me sleep. [Angry Shouting ] [ Gavel Pounding] Ah, ! see. When the officers of the royal naval cutter came aboard... you were awake. I had a dream. B-Bad dream. Y-You said ! had a dream! Emily, you're not having a dream now. The Dutch captain came on board. He is disappeared. Emily, do you know how? [ Spectators Murmuring ] Your brother and sisters and the Fernandez children were in the hold. Only Chavez was on deck. - You were in his cabin. - [ Crowd Gasping ] l-- I was sick. My leg. Your leg was hurt, but the wound had been bandaged. Yet in the cabin, nearto where you were lying, there was blood. - [ Spectators Gasp ] - There was also blood at the foot of the stairs. Was that your blood? - No. No! - Or was it the blood of Captain Vandervort? There was blood on Chavez‘s hands. He-- He-- He had a knife. Who had a knife? Emily, was Captain Chavez in the cabin? Y-- Yes. I don‘t remember! Uh-- It was awful. - You saw Captain Chavez? - He made... an awful noise. Then he died! He died! [ Spectators Clamoring ] - [ Gavel Pounding ] - Stop it! In God’s name, stop it! Can‘t you see what you're doing? Milord, ! will not permit my daughter to be subjected to this. [Zac ] What‘s she talking about? Silence! Be silent! ! agree. We've heard enough. Take the prisoners down and clear the gallery! Chavez! [ Shouting In Spanish ] [ Zac ] Chavez! What‘s she doing to us? Chavez! - Your little friend is gonna hang us. - They have to hang somebody. I don‘t want to die innocent. Zac, you must be guilty of-- of something. [ Man ] Hang them all! [Children Chattering ] Begging your pardon, sir. - You ought to feel proud of them children. - Yes. - Been reading all about it, the wife and I. - Yes, thank you. The way she stood up in the box—- Oh, thankyou, sir. They deserved hanging.
