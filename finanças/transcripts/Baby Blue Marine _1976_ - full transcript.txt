It was another time. There was innocence. Honesty was the best policy. Crime would not pay. Marriage was sacred. Promises were to be kept. People believed there was a reason for war. They believed that cowards died a thousand deaths, a hero only one. They died on land, at sea, and in the air They're older now, or dead. They are faded pictures; sometimes amusing.
