Ladies and gentlemen, dear audience,... ...a very good afternoon to you all. To make your trip more pleasurable,... ...l'll sing you a classic tango from our city lore. With you, ladies and gentlemen, it's Polaquito! -Hello. -Hello, Limp. You OK? -lt was a slow day. -Yeah? How much? Twelve. No one has a dime. And l'm... -Your sneaker. -Huh? Your sneaker. The other one! You fucking smartass punk! Don't try to bullshit me! l'm going to rip you a new asshole, fucker! Let go, Limp! Come on, Limp. Leave me something! l need to eat. Don't fuck with me. At least some for Chela... For being a dick! What are you looking at? Fuck you! -What's up, Vieja? -Hey, Chela. What's up, Vieja? Hey! Did you screw up? Your sister's pissed. He's a real son of a bitch, living off assholes like you,... ...that let their bosses shaft them. You should do what l do, dickhead. l can't, Vieja. Can you imagine me with a piece? No one would take me seriously. No balls? Are you going to say you're poor but honest? They'll fuck you up if you're such a wimp. Wait until your old man finds out... ...that Limp isn't giving Chela any dough. -That's not my thing, Vieja. -lt's not? Then what? lf you don't have balls don't complain. Look at those ''skids'' ! Cool! -Which ones? -Those! The Filas. Yellow and blue. To die for. Real cool. -l see them. -They're great. The Nikes run faster. Sneakers don't run, dickhead. You do. But some are faster than others. Be my lookout. l'm going to buy them. -No, Vieja. -Cut it out! Motherfucker! Fuck you, Vieja! Sorry. Oh, shit! Fuck! You don't like the Simpsons, huh? Looks like you hate them. Do you want me to show you? OK, sure. You have to avoid getting killed. l understand that much. There are many buttons. With this lever you move to the sides. The green button is for jumping, the red one for running. lt's easy. Put a token in and l'll help you. All right! Well, l gotta go, kid. No, stay. l have more tokens. l can't. l start working today. -Where do you work? -See you. Lottery! Plays today! One peso! -Can l get it on credit? -Get out of here. -Don't be so uptight! -Beat it! You were great, really great today! lt's all right. You should have jacked the Nikes! The black ones were hot. She's the hot one. -New? -She started today. Leave her alone. She's working. Are you her keeper, asshole? Butt out, fucker! Come on in, babe. Come in, come in. Come in, but keep it down. The kid's sleeping. Sleep, punk. He's such a jerk. -Come here. -Wait! What's up with you? Do you give head? Come on, suck it! -Suck it? -Yeah. Like that. You like it? Yes, do it. You enjoy it. -You coming? -l am. Don't go. Sleep over. No, asshole. They'd kill me at home. Fuck you! Hey, Polaco, she's hot, huh? She's an ace giving head. Ladies and gentlemen, dear audience,... ...a very good morning to you all. To make your trip more pleasurable,... ...a classic tango from our city lore. With you, it's Polaquito! She was whiter than water Fucking Bolivians! Coming to take our work? We're not Bolivians, we're Argentineans, from Jujuy! Same thing! You're not Argentineans! You look like fucking Bolivians! The kid's right! Go back to your country! What's wrong with you? Don't you dare touch me, son of a bitch! Hi. Hey, kiddo. -Have you eaten? -Not yet. -You eat it. l'm not hungry. -Thanks! Let's split it. What are you staring at? Take the hot dog, kiddo! Nice scarf. Yeah. A gift from my old man. What's that? Have you heard of the Brazilian Carnival? Beat it, kid! You, sweetheart, are you working or what? l'm working, sir! So do what you gotta do! Stop fooling around, you hear me? -Did you hear me? -Yes, l heard you! -What did you hear? -That l shouldn't fool around! Go on! Occupied. Occupied. What's up, Vieja? Do you have any paper? Sosa the Crane. Have you heard of him? He started stealing... ...so his dad wouldn't muddy his shoes on his way to work. Every time it rained, the streets turned to mud... ...and his shoes got dirty. He would carry his dad piggyback to the asphalt. And? That's why he started stealing... ...so no one in his family would get muddy again. ls that all you can say? He's a genius! They lock him up, he escapes every time. Why do they lock him up? Why do you think? Are you stupid or what? Listen you punk! Stop talking to Pelu! l'll beat the shit out of you and have you locked up! l don't want to see you with Pelu again! Don't give a damn. ls that clear?! Yes... Yes... Trying to steal my girl, Polaco? You're just a squirt. Look at her. Raining and picking. She's gonna wet her ass! What's up, Chela? Shit! Look at your eye! You screw up and l face the old man. You know he beats me up if l come home without dough. You asshole, trying to screw Limp! l didn't mean to screw him. l just hide the money so nobody can steal it. Right, and you forgot the money in your sneaker. What do you care? You're not at home, l am. You're the idiot for staying with that wino. -Where would l go? -You'd be better off anywhere else. -And mom? -No problem. She doesn't give a shit. -Yes, she does, and she suffers. -She does not! l put up the money for Limp, but l won't cover for you again. Then what the fuck happened to your eye? The same old story. He came home drunk. You've got to get out. lf he wants to fuck let him find a whore. And l'm the Queen of England? You came here to preach? Can't you see l'm working? l just came to see you. Vieja told me your face looked like shit. You just work and don't screw up again. Come on, Seneise! Show some balls! You have to win for your fans! Like this. Like this. Like this. Come here, bitch. Let go! Come here so l can do you up your ass. -You're not doing my ass! -Come on, bitch. Let go! Son of a bitch! Stop it! Asshole! Son of a bitch! Fucker! Let go of her, motherfucker! Let go of the kid, you asshole! Son of a bitch! Motherfucker! Who do you think you are, you fucking brat? Fucking shit! Who asked for your help? Look what he did to you! You're looking to get killed. Who asked you to come? Those guys are heavyweight. The last one was packing. Don't worry. By tomorrow your ass won't hurt any more. The second time it hurts less... ...and the third time you enjoy it. You can't work as a whore, and much less for Limp! One day he'll rape you. You'll end up like my sister. You think she should be a fligth attendant? You can be my partner. l sing, you pass the hat. -Can we make any money? -We can make a lot. Can't you see the kid's a millionaire? All l want is to live in Brazil with my old man. l can't stand it here! He left two years ago. He says he'll send me a ticket as soon as he can. l want to go there. l can't stand it here anymore. -Who do you live with now? -With my mom. Now she's with that bastard that beats both of us up. l can't stand it here. Move. Stop it! Don't touch! Not there! Give me the joint! Stop it! What's the matter with you! Sing another one, kid! Why not? This is our ticket. An international show. Would that embarrass you? You can really dance. Teach me a song, l sing and you dance. We'll make a bundle. You're nuts, kiddo. What's the matter with you? Nothing... Come on, dance for me. Come on! Just a little. Can't you see l'm eating? l'll pay you. You'd pay to see me dance? l get paid to fuck, not to dance. l want to see you dance. You sure are strange. Like this! Like this! Like this, Polaco! Watch! lt's over, Limp. l can't give you another dime. l want to work for myself. And Pelu won't be a whore anymore. She's my partner now. Are you nuts? Why did you say that? l don't know if l'm your partner. l might be a whore again tomorrow. A test is a test, Polaco. Come on, kid, making waves? lt's like me telling the chief of police... ...''sir, l'm going off on my own''. You can't do that. You have to play the game. lf the system works, we all make money. Or your dad doesn't use the money Limp gives him? He just gives him 2 pesos. Well, 2 today, 2 tomorrow... lt adds up. No it doesn't. He spends it all on wine. Your dad's a drunk but he's no fool. The wine cartons cover the holes in the roof when it rains. So thanks to your working and the drinking,... ...your family lives in a dry house, right? You're making a future for yourself. You're talented, intelligent, you have charisma. l have what? l'm saying this because l like you, like a son. Do me a favor, kid. Clean this. Does anybody have a smoke? ls anyone there? -What's up, Pelu? -Hey, Polaco. l was worried. Really? Yeah, they're really heavy in there. How do l know what they can do to you in there? Are you nuts? They love me in there. l had a great time last night. Don't you sweet talk to me. Let's go to the station. My throat's kind of dry. l can't sing. What do we do, then? -What's your name? -Polaquito. -Where are you from? -Constituci?n Station. Constituci?n, of course. And why are you working here? Who do you work for, Polaquito? Do you want to work for Nu?ez? l work on my own. On your own? Great. So let me tell you, Polaquito from Constituci?n,... ...you can't work on that corner. lf l catch you there again, l'll tear your guts out. Got it? -What breed are they? -Golden. -Are you giving them away? -l'm selling them. -How much? -300 dollars. A dozen? No, honey, each one. But over there a guy's giving some cute puppies away. How come he gives his away and you sell yours? These are pedigree dogs and those are street dogs. l don't mean these are better at all. Sure they are. They cost $300. The others are fakes. People want a pedigree,... ...but you don't need that to play with a dog. lt was for my girlfriend. l can't give her a fake. lt's not the best of cameras. lt's rather cheap. -How much do you want? -300. Are you nuts? lncluding the crutches, l'll give you 50. What? 50? Look at the camera! Yeah, 50 bucks. Cheapskate! Look at those crappy sneakers you bought! -They're cool. -Do they run fast? Where's Pelu? She went to get some beers. You're hot for her, huh? -l brought a crystal. -Answer me! You want to fuck her, right? We're partners. Don't be stupid. Have you ever done it? l told you l have. l don't believe you. You've never fucked. l have, jerk. Then tell me what pussy is like. When you fuck, you don't look. lf you've seen God's face, you should know. Tell me. l don't know. lt's like a dick but inward. What an idiot! Don't laugh! lt does goes in. Of course, jerk! lt can't go outward! You've never seen a pussy, not even in a porno! Get out! Where the fuck did you go? -And you? l worked all day. -How did it go? Here, l brought you a gift. You're hot for her. You're a punk. Find someone your own age. There's a kindergarten down the street. Hey, open your gift. Don't you open a gift? -The shirt's cool. -lt's really cool, kid. Real nice. Real cool. At least now you've seen some tits. Now l have to give you something. lt's cool. Give him that crappy scarf. lt's not crappy! lt's sacred to me! lt's beautiful. l'll never give it to anyone, got it? Because her queer dad gave it to her. He's no queer! He lives in Brazil and sends you a scarf! He's an ass! Aren't you going home? Maybe l will, maybe l won't. And what does your mom say? l don't give a shit. Don't get worked out, Limp. Just pretend she's on vacation. Polaco, your sister came by again. And she left with empty hands. She was worried about what your dad would do. Don't be an ass. Go back to singing on the trains. You're doing all right. And your sister wouldn't get punched. Come on, babe. lt was a joke. The scarf's cool. Get out. -Come on, Pelu. -What? -Babe? -What? Show Polaquito your pussy. Come on. Don't be an asshole. Come on, so the kid can learn what it's like. ls that enough for you, Pola? You want to see my pussy? Here, here. The kid's not like you. You think he's a faggot? Maybe he is. What are you smoking, Polaco? l visited that ass once. lt was a nice visit, remember? Don't say you didn't like it. Be good and l'll introduce you to my boss. He likes punks too. lt will hurt less this time because it's open now. You just have to enjoy it. Your first time, right? l'm asking because your ass was so tight! l'm sure the girl's is wider, huh? l think l'll visit that one too. What are you doing, punk? Fuck you! l can't give you more than 10 for that. Hey, Polaco. Problems with your old man again. Last night they jacked his horse. How many times l told you to wake me up? How many times? Why the fuck didn't you? l told you a thousand times! Now you'll pull the cart, bitch! Now you'll do it! Get out of here! Don't touch me or l'll hurt you! Come here, you bitch! Leave her alone, you son of a bitch! Leave her alone, you son of a bitch! Stop it! -Let go of her! -Come here, fucking bitch! What's wrong with you? Fuck you, pig! -Motherfucker! -Stop it! Leave him alone! Fucking punk! What have you done? Stop it, stop it! Leave him alone! Stop it, stop it! -She's your old lady, huh? -Yeah. She's a bitch. What happened to your face? Nothing. l fell in the tub. Come on, don't bullshit me. Tell me something. What would be a perfect night for you? A perfect night? Don't know... ''Hi, princess.'' He always calls me ''princess''. '' Brazil is a beautiful country. You'll love it.'' ''lt's full of palm trees and beaches.'' ''l can't wait to have you here. l'm saving money for that.'' ''l love you.'' -Can l read it? -No way. Go ahead an eat. We can get another one. -Did you like them? -What? My tits. l saw you checking them out. Did you like them? Sure. Would you like them bigger? No, they're nice. What's up with you, kid? l don't know. Have you been with anyone? With a woman? No. -Stop, Pelu. -What's the matter? -Nothing. -Come on, tell me. Don't know how to do it. What are you doing here, Polaco? Again? Are you trying to catch up? Pelu, do you love me? Don't ask stupid things, kiddo. Everything's fine. Fuck it! lt's empty! Wake up, you cunt! Get out of here! Open your eyes! -What the fuck? -Get out, you fucking bitch! Playing around, you fucking bitch? Get out! -Hey, wait a minute! -You shut up, you cunt! You fucked this whore and you didn't tell me! You should've asked me! l have to tell you? You have to let me know, fucker! -Hey, wait! -Shut up! l'd have let you do it! Fuck her if you want to! -l'd even hold her legs! -Cut it out, asshole! l'm talking to you, fucker! Am l an asshole? Am l? You're from my digs. Wrong. l'm not from your digs, you're from mine. Asshole! -Vieja, you're going too far! -Shut your trap! -You do things on your own? -Stop it! What's wrong with you, bitch? Come here! Come here! Let go of me, son of a bitch! What are you doing, asshole? You two don't respect shit! You hear me? Next time l see you together, l'll burn you both, got it? Don't play with me. Fuck you! We have to get out of here, Pelu. -Where can we go? -Anywhere. We'll start all over. This has gone to shit. Hey, Polaco! -Are you taking a trip? -Yeah. Where? Anywhere. Don't be a jerk, Polaco. You're turning it all to shit. Stay and we'll work it out. Want more money? l can fix it. Where would you be better off than here? Anywhere, Limp. That's a mistake, Polaquito. Life is hard for me, for you, for everyone. Here you have work, somewhere to eat. You have food, and you're throwing your future away? You have a future, Polaquito. Don't fuck it up. Bye, Limp. Polaco! Good luck, kid! Leave the kid alone! Stop it, son of a bitch! Fuck you! Darling, you can see him now. -Hi, Polaquito. -Hey, Pelu. l was thinking, we could go to Cordoba. And to Brazil. Far away, where no one can fuck us up. We'll make an international show. We'll make a bundle. l swear. Why are you laughing? l'm not laughing. Can't you see my eyes? l'm crying. Why? l'm fine. lt's over, Polaco. l'm working for Limp again. Why did you do that? ln a few days l'll be out. Cut it out. You don't understand. Do you want them to get us both? lt's serious. They put coke on you. When you get better, they'll lock you up. Are you crazy? Why? l've heard that. They'll send you to a juvenile hall. Why for Limp? Work for yourself. Or for someone else who's not such a fucker. He's my stepfather. There's no one else. Here, you keep this. l won't be locked up. REFORMATORY Here, kid, wash this. l washed it yesterday. l gave it to you earlier today. l farted and it came out with something else. This is clean, Rat. Wash it anyway. l want it clean tonight. lt looks that you have a bad attitude No, Rat, it's OK. Why? That's it, kiddo. Fucking faggot. Why won't you tell us? Nothing happened. l just fell from the train. lt jerked and l fell. What do you want me to tell you? -And the cocaine? -What cocaine? They found it in your clothes. l don't know about that. l don't do drugs. Maybe some weed, some vapors, but not coke. You didn't fall, you were thrown. We know that. What we want to know is why. lt'll be easier if you help us. You'll even get out sooner. Who did you work for? l'm no snitch. You want to know, you find out. And why the fuck should l want to get out? To go back with your family. l'm fine here. The judge ruled that you'll go back with your parents. He didn't ask me. Polaco, the old man promised to stop drinking. Don't be stupid, Chela. We'll monitor the situation to avoid any abuse. lf your dad touches you, he goes to jail. l asked him to come to make that clear. Oh, now l do feel safe. Talk to me, Vieja! Don't be like that! How did they catch you? Still mad at me? Come on! Put it behind you! l didn't screw you. l've always been honest. Are you making trouble again? Let me watch the game. Did your friend tell you the rules here? -Tell me. -lt's easy. You do as l say... ...and when l say don't do something, you don't. -And who the fuck are you? -Stop it! -He's the big dick here! -He is? This clown's the big dick? What's wrong with you? Are you faggots? -Why did you do that? -Everything has a reason. A reason? They beat us up! You deserve it for being a fucking traitor. -How's everything at the station? -The same. -ls Limp still there? -Of course. The cops are still a pain in the ass? lf you want to ask about that cunt Pelu, do it, asshole! -Do you see her? -Yeah. -So? -So what? She's pregnant. What? Now you think it's yours? Do you have the magic cum? You think you fucked her once and got her pregnant? The father could be me or anyone who paid 30 pesos! How many men did she fuck? That baby's a cocktail! Half German, half Japanese, half black, half faggot like you. -That baby's mine! -What a son of a bitch! We need to escape. Escape? l'll get out through the door! That's why l'm here. -The door? -Yes, the door. Count me in! l'm going with you! -Forget it, asshole. -Why not, Vieja? Get off it! You're all worked up because she's pregnant? You'd go looking for her! Are you marrying that whore? And l still remember you screwed me. Give it a rest! Not until you apologize. All right, l apologize. lt's not like that. Apologize on your knees. Don't make me do that. On your knees and you can come with me. Get up, asshole! Never get down on your knees! Be a man! Only cocksucking faggots do that! Stop yelling! Where do you think you are? Stop it or you'll be here two more weeks! You have a visitor. Ten minutes only. Don't drink that crap. lt'd give you the shits. You fucked my nose up. Plastic surgery. lt looks better now. Are we assholes or what? Again? What for? -You know him? -Tell him when l beat the shit out of you. Fuck off! l come here to sort this out and you show off? lf you want trouble, fine. l'm not afraid of you, cunt. Don't get pissed, Rat! lf you come to sort this out, that's fine. lf l go to the yard, half the kids would come with me. You know two leaders in one place will cause trouble. One of us has to go. l have a good setup. l'm Maradona in here. -Then l'm getting out. -With me, right? You shut up. The kid's coming with me. Too bad. He's good washing. How do we escape? lt won't be escaping, but l can set something up. But you go to the yard and put things right. Hey, Rat! What's up, Rat! Hey, Rat! l don't want trouble with you. l fucked up. l'm sorry. That's no way to apologize. There's no other way. -On your knees. -No way, jerk. l'll do it. -Get up, asshole! -Leave me alone! We apologize, Rat. We screwed up bad. We're two assholes. OK, you have 24 hours to do it. You'll be back tomorrow night with the money you get. Fifty-fifty, do you understand? We do. Don't worry. lf you don't come, we'll go after you. Rat said two pieces. Outside in the Dumpster. Take them. Let's go. Thanks. -Bye, Mabel. -Bye. What's up, Polaco? lf you want crack, there's no good stuff. lf you want vapors... l'm not buying, l'm selling. Selling what? Polaco! They let you out? How much for Pelu, Limp? She's doing well. lt's 50. Do you want her for you? Yeah. l'll take 30. Polaco, enjoy her. Wait, wait, Pelu! -Why? -l want to talk. -About what? -The baby. What baby? What are you talking about? What baby? Our baby! What else? Our baby? Are you crazy or what? lt could be anyone's! That baby's mine, Pelu. l know it. And anyway, l don't give a shit. You're nuts, kiddo. You're really nuts. Why? What's wrong? How much did Limp charge you? Thirty. Stop talking nonsense and get what you paid for. l don't want to fuck. Why did you pay 30 then? l want us to have the kid. l don't. l really don't. This sucks. Why the fuck bring a kid into this world? l just want to go to Brazil and be with my dad,... ...save some money. That's what l want. Limp, fucking snitch! Give me two days, Pelu. Don't fuck it up. Just two days. -Where have you been? -Around. Fucking up, l'm sure. -l need money. -Go and sing on the train. No, l need a lot of money. Have you seen the paper? l need it soon. Like this guy. A true idol. Much better than Maradona! l'll do what it takes. So let's do it big. We're going to make a lot of dough. Tomorrow we'll get new clothes. Good clothes, man. We had a long night. We're a bit out of it, you hear me? Don't do anything stupid and things will be just fine. But if you do something, there'll be trouble. Take it easy. Everything's cool. We won't do anything strange,... ...but we've just opened and there's no money yet. All we have is some change. Did you hear him? He thinks we're assholes. Calm down. Everything's cool. We know that, jerk! We're professionals! Who said we wanted money? Did l say that, you fucker? You look like a model. l liked the yellow jacket better. Come on, jerk! With black trousers you'd look like a taxi! Besides, yellow is too flashy. We want to keep a low profile. Did you think we're going jet setting? Now what? Now we smoke, we go for a walk,... ...or we get a beer. And then, you know what, we're going to have lunch. Did you fuck her good? l think so. Well, like everyone else. Not like everyone. Some guys fuck good and some fuck really bad. Well... l don't know. But did she enjoy it? -l think so. -You think? Did she or didn't she? How do you know? Son of a bitch! You know it by the things she says! What did she say when you fucked? She didn't say anything, but she was breathing. -She has to breath, jerk! -lt was heavy breathing. What a jerk! You probably didn't get it in and came on her legs. And you think you got her pregnant! What if the baby's a Nip? What would you say? l saw her with a Chinese. Maybe he got it in! -How long did it last? -What? The fuck! 2 minutes, 10, half an hour? l don't fuck with a stopwatch! Don't get pissed. l'm joking. Don't be so touchy. Have you decided yet? Eat, you fool. You can't eat like this working for Limp. Who brings you here? Only Vieja does that! Although you fucked my girl without asking. -Come on, eat. -l'm not hungry. -You're scared shitless. -No... Yes, you are. You told me you'd do anything. Don't back out now. Positive thinking. When you do a job, you don't think about the cops. Do you understand? You don't think about them. l'm not backing out. Then stop fucking around and eat. Anything else, Polaco? No, l'm full. Well, listen to me now. The thing starts when he brings the check. We pull out the guns and do what we came to do. -The gun. -The guns. l have one, you have another. l don't. l sold it last night. Can't you do anything right, motherfucker? Your check, guys. 60 pesos. No discount for union members? The gastronomic union? No, thieves, asshole. -Don't do anything stupid. -Calm down. l'll blow your brains out. Walk. -All right, but calm down. -Shut up and walk. Open the register and give me the money. Come on! Come on! Are you playing dumb? Lift the tray! The big bills. Take care of it. Don't you lose it. -No, Vieja... -l want the keys of the place. Come on, lock it up. -What for, Vieja? -Just lock up the place! All you assholes, shut up and listen! Don't do anything stupid and no one will get hurt. lf anyone wants to be a hero, it'll be the end. Just give all the money to my friend. Kid, get the money. -Hurry up! -Come on! The money! Hurry up! We're in a rush! Faster! Faster! And don't hide any bill. He's violent and has a gun. We don't pull more guns to avoid scaring the children. Come on! The money! Come on! Just do as we say. Easy. Don't do anything. l'm just like everybody else. Come on, hurry up, dick! Don't kill me. Move it, kid! Close the curtains, motherfucker! No one moves here. Give us all your money or you'll be in trouble. Was that you, fatso? What did you do, fucker? l'll kill you all! Go back to your tables! Sit and stay quiet! Close the curtains! We can get to the roof through the kitchen. This is going to be hell. We still have time to get out. You go, l'll stay a bit. We still have time, Vieja. Let's move or they'll kill us! l want to be on TV! Then l'll grab a lady and get away. Just take the money and save my half. l'll be all right. That shit you took is screwing your brain. Vieja, get me out of here. You go, motherfucker! Leave me alone! Faggot! Come out with your hands up! lf you want to negotiate, send the reporters! And don't screw up... -...or l'll kill everybody! -Nothing's gonna happen. And don't send a cop disguised as a reporter or l'll do him! We'll make a clean deal or we'll have trouble. ls it clear? Come out with your hands up! We have to talk, Pelu. -No, we don't. -Yes, we do. Come with me. Say what you have to say and leave me alone. -Let's go somewhere else. -l don't want to. Can't you see l don't want to talk? -Here. -Where did you get all this money? lt doesn't matter! Let's go to Brazil and meet your dad. We'll give him a grandchild. He'll be so happy. What's wrong, Pelu? Didn't you want to go to Brazil with your dad? He doesn't exist, Polaco. l made it up. And the letters where he called you ''princess''? You made that up? You wrote them. We can go anyway. Let's have the kid in Brazil. This country is sinking. And l could make big money singing tango abroad. We'll make it. Don't cry. We'll be OK. You don't believe me. We'll call him Vadinho, like the soccer player. But he won't be black. He'll be a genius anyway. And if he's not, he'll be our son all the same. We're having a kid, Pelu! lt'll be great! The baby doesn't exist either. Why do you think l was playing games? Limp made me have an abortion last night. l'm sorry. Shit! lt's a wave of crime that has claimed a new victim. This time it was a young offender, almost a child,... ...who under the effect of drugs... ...and with an accomplice even younger than him,... ...tried to hold up a well-known restaurant. -The police... -What's up, Polaco? Give me whatever you've got. ...with different police unites and a helicopter... Do you understand? As long as you work here, no one will bother you. Not the cops, not those fucking niggers fooling around. lf they do, you come and talk to me... ...and l take care of it. You're cute. Sit down. As long as you work with us... ...and don't fuck it up, you'll be OK. Working on your own is hard. The cops can come and beat you up. lt's dangerous. Come with me, Limp. Let's sort this out. Looks like you're learning, Polaco. Shut up, fucker! You, beat it! Listen to me, Polaco! Don't do anything stupid. -lf it's about Pelu, we can fix it. -Move! lt's about Pelu, Vieja, me,... ...and because you're a son of a bitch. -Wait! Wait! -Your time has come. You think it's my fault? You're mistaken, Polaco! There are worse bastards out there. lf you kill me, there will be others. Kneel down and ask the Virgin for forgiveness! Don't kill me, son! Pray, motherfucker! Ask the Virgin for forgiveness! ''Our Father who art in heaven...'' Fuck you! Watch out, Polaco! Pray, motherfucker! Now you'll kneel down, son of a bitch! Only cocksucking assholes like you kneel down! Fuck you, you pile of shit! Faggot! Motherfucker! THE CASE WAS CLOSED AS ''SUlClDE''
