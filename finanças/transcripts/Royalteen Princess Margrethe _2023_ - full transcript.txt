Ingrid? Sorry, you can't go back there. The waiting room is right in there. I'm sorry, but you'll have to wait. Take her to room three. How is the princess doing? I'm fine. - Mm. - Did you get her results? Yes, Your Majesty. In addition to alcohol we found traces of benzodiazepine and cocaine in her system, but the tests show no signs of organ damage, so... - Cocaine? - Yes, and benzodiazepine. It's something you would find in powerful sedatives, like in Sobril for instance. Due to how addictive it can be, we'd recommend the princess be admitted for psychiatric care. No, Doctor. That won't be necessary. I understand, Your Majesty. What were you thinking? I don't know. Did you even consider what the consequences could be if this got out? How damaging it could be? For you and for everyone. You'll never do this again. Understood? - Do you understand? - Yes. Good. So, back to school, huh? Margrethe. Margrethe? Just try not to worry. - They've probably forgott... - Kalle! I don't really need a pep-talk right now. - Okay, sure. - I'm fine. Sure. Sorry. So you're not freaking out at all? No, I'm actually not. - Hey. - Hey. - Hi. - Hi. - How do you feel? - Fine. Did you get your results, or are they still waiting? Did they find out if... Uh... I'm sorry, I shouldn't have... - Didn't mean to pry. - Great, then don't. MARGRETHE WAS PICKED UP IN AN AMBULANCE!!! ANYONE KNOW WHY? HEARD SHE FREAKED OUT... SHE WAS WASTED, HAD TO GET PUMPED. RELIABLE SOURCE SAYS SHE WAS DEHYDRATED. DEHYDRATED? WTF? SHE DRANK SO MUCH! MISS PERFECT IS IN TROUBLE... WHAT A FUCKED UP ROYAL FAMILY ROLE MODEL, OR WHAT? TOO BAD SHE DIDN'T DIE!!! GET A GRIP! I FEEL SORRY FOR HER!! Oh, you're here. Oh! - Hi. - Hey. - Hey, what's up? - Hi! Thanks for prom. Sure. You got so drunk. I mean, I got drunk too. You had quite the dramatic exit, flashing lights... I should get going. Yeah, right. I should go as well. I'll see you round, I guess. - So what did he want? - Nothing. Hey. Hey. I'm sick and tired of people asking how you're doing. But I, uh... How are you doing? Asshole. I thought you were gonna die. Hey... Don't you cry on me. Be a man. No, you be a man. - So, uh... - Yeah? Um... Do you want to tell me what happened at prom with Gustav Heger. I, um... I'm not sure. Mm. Mm. Nothing really happened, but... I mean nothing happened. Don't worry. - Are you sure? - Yeah. I'm sure. Okay. Alexander? Wait, you mean Prince Alexander of Denmark? - That Alexander? - That's him. Oh my God. He likes you? He doesn't like me like that. He's just being nice, Ingrid. - Oh sure. Yeah. I believe that. - Yeah. - So we got a winky face and a big heart? - Yeah. "Hope that we can see eachother soon." You're crazy if you think that means anything. Maybe I am, but you never know. That heart's pretty obvious though. Just sayin'. - Thanks for that. - Where should we... Wanna go to the rec room? Wait, are you hungry, though? Yeah, I was actually starving, so... - Yo, girls! What's up? - Hi, Jens! - Hi. - Hey. Did it go well today? Mm-hmm. - That's good. - Margrethe has a new crush. - Stop it. - Isn't that nice. No, it's nothing. Is he cute, then? I mean she, or they. - He. - It's, uh, Prince Alexander of Denmark. - Ooh, la, la, la, la. - Mm-hmm. Ingrid is exaggerating. He's just sent me a text. - It was a very sweet text. - Yeah, it was nice. Very nice. Speaking of which, have you seen those beach photos of Alexander that have been floating around? He's looking very symmetrical. No, I try to avoid seeing photos from the paparazzi - I'm just gonna... - Yeah. - Be there soon. - Sure. No. Please, dear. It hurts my eyes. It's four o'clock, Mom. I'm thinking, um... about the hospital opening tomorrow. Do I have to? Yes, dear. I know that... it'd be weird if I wasn't there. Then there's nothing to discuss. This has been planned for some time. We have to do it. You're the strongest of us. Margrethe? Yeah? Close the door behind you. It's telling me to find the number A, but A isn't a fucking number, it's a letter. How was your mom doing? Um, you know, the usual. Hey... Everything will be okay. And what if it won't be? Then it'll go to shit. Deep stuff. You should get a career as, um... a motivational speaker, since you are so inspiring and motivating. Yeah, I'll need something to fall back on when I eventually fail out of high school, so... Come on. Stop it. You won't fail. I promise. What exercise was it? Seven, something like that. How does the princess feel about returning to the hospital she herself was treated at? I'm grateful for all the help I received during my stay, and yeah, I have nothing but deep respect for our Norwegian health care. - Thank you. - Thank you. Could the princess provide comment regarding the reason for her stay? Sorry, the royal family will not be taking any personal questions today. - Welcome, Your Highness. - Thank you. Over here, we've got the new ward. You'll see the new ward later. Sounds great. ...benzodiazepine and cocaine... You'll never do this again. Margrethe? Margrethe? Are you okay? Hmm. - Your Majesty? - Yeah. Come on. Awesome. - Ready for the surprise party? - Yeah! Look what I got. Nice! She's gonna love it. Want one? Mm. Sure. - Hmm? - No, thank you. - I got two of them. - What, two. Yeah. Hi. - Hi. - Hi. - Hi, babe. - Hey. There you go. - Hey, Lena! - Hi. Hold it like this. Your hand goes here. Just relax. Think you're gonna be queen someday, you need to know all of this. Hey, she's here. Get ready. Come on, guys. Surprise! - Done dancing already? - Yeah, I just... I get self-concious. And I just... So... Yeah, I get it. But you're good, though? - Yeah, yeah. I'm good. - Good. Are you good? - Yeah, I'm really good. - Okay. That's good. So... Yeah. - What? - There's confetti in your hair. - Confetti, really? - Yeah. - Is there any in your hair? - Not sure. Can you check? Actually, I found one. - Is there? - Mm-hmm. It's like a bird's nest in there, honestly. Sorry, it's... Don't worry. I got it. Perfect. - What, do I have more? - I think there's one more. Here. - Uh, sorry. I just thought... - No, I was... No. - I guess I misunderstood. - Hey, DJ Arnie! You gotta play your song, man. Nah, it's not done yet, it's... Come on. This is the perfect place to play it. Hey, how's everyone doing? Good. - Oh Hey! - How you doing? We'll be back... - Do it like on a catwalk. - Fine. I'll strut the catwalk for you. - Not like I haven't done it before. - Oh yeah? - I've been around. - I can tell. You're a model. - Are you ready for this? - Yeah, yeah. I'm ready. Ooh. - Ooh. - You like this, don't ya? Oh yeah! - Mm-hmm. - Ooh. Mm. Hold on. Wait. Wait. Oh my God. This is so weird. This bag got in my pocket somehow. I should probably give it a sniff to make sure. You know what it is, right? You know, you gotta be safe. It's a brilliant idea, don't you think? We just need to make sure that it's all safe. - Oh, I sniffed it a little too hard. - Give me. - It all flew up my nose. - Can I have some? Yeah, go ahead. I didn't know, uh, cocaine was your thing. How you doing now, Princess? I am doing horribly, but I do feel fantastic. Whoa. You heard it here first. She's horrible, but fantastic. Now back to the studio. You know, you're nothing like I expected. Not at all. - What did you expect me to be like? - I thought you'd be way more... - Like this? - ...smile and wave. - Smile and wave? - Uh-huh. Mm. - That's just my mask, Gustav. - Your mask? I see. - What kind of mask is it? - One I can put on whenever I want. - Really? - Why, wanna see? - Yeah, show me. - Do I have to? Yeah. - What? Is it on now? - No. - My bad. - Two seconds. I am incredibly grateful to be standing before none other than the great Gustav Heger, joining me today. Tonight, at this amazing prom, where everything went to shit. - Wow! Incredible. - Where I've been so fake and disgusting. No, you're still fucking hot. Don't say that. You're not disgusting. You're hot as hell. - Do you really mean that? - Yeah, I mean it. - So hot. Am I hot too? - You're not bad either. - Okay. Really. - Uh-huh. The video. - The video, you have to delete it. - Relax, I'll do it later. No, you need to delete it now. - Come on. Where is your phone? - Yeah, okay. I'll take care of it. Isn't this so romantic? What do you mean? Is it wrong to ask you to delete it? No, it's just... Yeah. What the fuck? You're posting it? - Trying to delete... - What the hell are you up to? - Give me my phone back! - What the fuck? How dare you, asshole! Oh my God! I'm out of here. Come here. - Hey, you. - Hi. - Hey, cheers. - Cheers. - Yeah, cheers. You good? - Yeah. How about you? Having fun? Mm. - Yeah, lot's of fun. - Yeah? That's nice. - So... - So, about that video? - From prom. - Ah. I was wondering if you deleted it, or something like that, or... - Oh right. I, uh... Yeah. - Yeah? - It's deleted, for sure. - Yeah? - Yeah. - You really deleted it? - Yeah, I deleted it. - Okay. - Is that why you came? - Yes! All right. - Yeah. - Oh, what a relief. - It's... - Thank you. I mean, it's deleted, but you know, there's like... uh, the cloud, or, you know, I've got other devices. What devices? Maybe you can drop by some day. Thinking maybe we can sit down, take a look at it together. It's, uh... It's a bit complicated. So feel free to drop by, that way we... can make sure it's really gone. Yeah? Oh, and I think you owe me a new phone. So, you know... Yeah. Come on over. Just don't call me, 'cause you know... You can just ring the doorbell. No. TO GUSTAV DELETE THE VIDEO FROM THE DANCE, YOU FUCKING PSYCHOPATH You're gonna drop me! You'll drop me! Stop. Put me down. Put me down. Back it off! - I totally had it. - You weren't in control. - You weren't. - After you. Thank you. Good morning. Morning. Ah. I thought we agreed that Sundays would be for family time. With what family exactly? The party was fun last night. Mm-hmm. - It was. - Mm-hmm. Totally. Did you hear Fanny left with Arnie? - No. Really? Those two? - Yes! Yeah. Yeah. I never would've guessed. Margrethe, do you know about this? No, I... It'd be nice if that did. The group could use one more couple. - True. - Can't say it wouldn't be cool. Very cool. We've received a special request directly from the Danish court. They want to stay close to home for Easter this year. Excuse me, but shouldn't Mom be joining us for this? No. Your mom needs to rest. So the Danish royals suggested that they come her to Norway and visit you at the cabin. Prince Alexander has become quite fond of Norwegian nature. I think this trip would be a great plan. Oh yes. Hear me out. Mom loves to hang out with Louise, and we love hanging with them. So why don't we just kill two birds with one stone by getting some fresh air all the while, you cheer Mom up a little? - I guess we could, um... - I agree! That would be great. So it's decided, then. - Perfect. - Great. Good meeting, guys. Thanks. That's all right. Can't forget alpine boots for Kalle. And Margrethe will need a new helmet. I'm thinking about you too. I know. It just wouldn't work. Hey, ready to go. I'll be joining you very soon. Take care. Have a nice trip. Enjoy your ride. - Don't you look great, Your Highness. - Thank you. So the plan is, you and I will take the Volvo together and Kalle will go with Margrethe. But you kinda have to come ski with me. Yeah, but... If Lena doesn't want to, I can't... You know, you can just tell me if you're too scared. Oh, you think I'm scared. Kalle, do you know who Dad was gonna go meet? Wait. You gotta check this. Can I use the Bluetooth? Just listen to it, okay? No! - That's Arnie? - DJ Arnie! Are you serious? Sofia? - Hi! - There they are. - Hi there. We're all finally here. - It's so good to see you. - Hi. - You look lovely. It's so nice to see you. - It's been far too long. - Excuse me. - We're just so happy to be here. - Alexander is... Uh, yeah. I believe he's on the terrace. - I have something to give you. - You do? It's in the other room. It feels nice, doesn't it? Yeah, it's... very beautiful. - Look at you! - Hey, Alexander. - It's been way too long! - Yeah. It's been way too long. So you're relaxing out here? Oh yeah. I was just enjoying the Norwegian landscape. This must be so different than your home, uh, back in Denmark. - Right? - It's much flatter back home. Very flat. - Yeah, flat. Mm-hm. - Really flat. Yeah. So you just get here? Hmm? Um. So did you just arrive? - Yeah, we just made it here. - Sure. Just got in. Your Norwegian's great. Watch out or I'll be more Norwegian than Danish by the time we leave. It's perfect, that's all. That's all. - Tell them, Mom. - No, no, no. I had told Christian that I was a remarkable skier. - Remarkable. - Stop! I told him I could ski in order to impress him because he had just started dating. Yeah, and I was so nervous 'cause I hadn't been skiing much, but I rode that lift all the way to the very top. By the time I got to the top, my entire body had gone numb. - That's not true! - Sverre took off like a true Norwegian. He did! Christian practically fell over. So embarrassing. Alexander. - None for me. Thank you so much. - Alexander is a vegetarian. Right? Someone has to set a good example in the family. And I can't expect you to do it. Today's youth. Anyway, somehow I managed to intertwine both of my skis with Sofia's and with Christian's skis at the same time. - Both of them? - Can you believe it? All I remember is the three of us laying there in a pile with our skis and poles all over the place. - Like... - What's so funny? - Hello! Hi. - Oh Hey. Great to see you. You made it! Yeah, finally here. Hi, Louise. - Thought you'd never come. - Sorry it took so long. Glad you're here. - Hey there. - Hey there. - Good to see you. - Yeah. Really well. - Looking great. - You too. Well, I'd like to apologize for my delay. Take it you were out on another adventure, like usual. One of your fishing trips, I mean. You've always been a busy man. Oh yeah, right. That's for sure. Okay, shall we toast? - Absolutely. Cheers! - Cheers! - Thank you all for joining us. - Cheers. It's great to get everyone together. It's been far too long. - Cheers. - Cheers. Cheers. Hello? - Morning. - Morning! - Did I wake you? - Hmm? - Did I wake you? - Huh? Did I wake you up? What? No, no. I've been awake for a while now. Perfect, because I was wondering if you wanted to come join me on the slopes? Yeah, sure. I'd love to come. Mm... When were you thinking? Pretty soon if that's possible. Soon. Okay, yeah, um... Just give me five minutes, then... - Sure. - ...to, uh, get changed. - Okay? - Perfect. - I'll wait for you out front. - Yeah. See you. - You look good. - Thank you. Royals need to stick together, am I right? There's too few of us left. It's not exactly like we've been given an easy job, right? It's really not. Everyone expects us to be just so fucking perfect all the time. It's a hard job. Especially when the monarchy has become so fragile lately. Imagine being the one who's responsible for the fall of royalty. Know what I mean? Just one tiny scandal, and hundreds of years of history will just be gone. Like that. Imagine having that next to your name in history books. You know, there's also the cloud, and I've got other devices. What devices? That stuff's kinda complicated, so feel free to drop by. Yeah. I've got other devices. Thanks for coming out here by the way. The snow on the mountain's perfect today. I am doing horribly, but I feel fantastic. Woo-hoo! Woo! Oh. Margrethe? Margrethe? Margrethe, are you okay? What's happening? What's wrong? - Come on. Everything's all right. - Sorry... What's wrong? Hello, you there? Come on. It's all good. It's good. - Oh my God. I can't do it. - Give me your hand. Oh no. Don't look down. Just don't look down. No, no, no, no, no, no. Look at me. No, look at me. Hey. Can't you turn towards me? You can do it. A little more. A bit more, please. Thank you. Now, do as I say. Okay? You understand me? You need to do just as I say. Trust me. Have you breathed in a square before? No? Okay. I'm gonna need you to picture a square. Keep your eyes on me. Keep your eyes on me. Okay, now picture a square. You see the square? You see it? Okay, now slowly breathe in. In... and out. Yeah, you've got it. Look at you. You're good at breathing in a square. It should help. Ready? Are we skiing down that? Yeah. Let's go down. Wait! Holy shit! You okay? Yeah, I'm okay! Shit. That was totally on purpose. Okay. Yeah, right. Oh, I got a little something for you. Oh, did you? - Close your eyes and put your hand out. - Okay. Boom. Open them. Oh wow. - How Norwegian. - Mm-hmm. - Have you had this before? - No, can't say I have. - First time for everything. - Yeah. - Wait. - Mm-hmm. Whoa, uh... - You know you can... Okay. - I got it. For you. Mm. - It's really the best chocolate. - I agree. You do? Are you feeling better now? Yeah. I'm just afraid of heights. Mm-hmm. - So... - Okay. I'm feeling better though. Really, I'm sorry I scared you. - No, no worries. You're all good. - I just... Does it often happen to you? It only really happens with heights. Thankfully. Well, I wasn't really... I wasn't talking about that, but rather your anxiety and the panic attack. But I don't have anxiety. I really don't. Okay. - I'm telling you, I don't. - Okay, I hear ya. My mom does though. I'm... I'm not really crying. It's just wind. Yeah, we tell everyone it's ME. Mm-hmm. But it's not. It's severe anxiety. That's why she doesn't... yeah, spend much time with us lately. Mm. Must be... Must be hard. I can only imagine. I mean, for all of you. And for her, of course. Yeah. It is what it is. Would you ever believe that we are 1379 meters in the air right now? I don't have any idea what you said, but that's cool. - I guess that means we're really high up. - I know everything. - Oh wow. Okay. - Shh. Don't tell anyone. Is that... Is Kalle over there? Sure. Should we go say hello? Yeah, we... I just thought we were going for another run, right? Let's do that afterwards. We should hang out with them first. Don't you think? Okay. Come on. - Hey. Ahh. - Hi. - Nice seeing you. How you doing? - Same here. Guys, this is Prince Alexander of Denmark. Nice meeting you all. Thanks for having me. - Hi. - Alexander. - Ingrid. - Ingrid? - Yeah. - It's nice meeting you. Pleasure. Let's drink. Thanks for that. Cheers. - Cheers. - Cheers. Guess who talked to the DJ and requested us a song? - It's his song. - His song? Mm-hmm. Hey, it's hard to dance in ski boots. Right. Do you know where the bathroom is? Yeah, there. Over there. Hey! You two look so cute together. - He's perfect for you. Just perfect. - I know. - He's way hotter in person. Seriously. - Now. Please try not to be Princess "I Don't Want To." I will try my best, then. - Yeah! - Awesome. It was very nice meeting your friends. Mm-hmm. So what are we doing tonight? Um, we're going to Ingrid's. I'm gonna take a quick shower, but why don't we meet up and drive to Ingrid's together, hmm? For sure. Mm-hmm. - Perfect. See you later. - Yep. Fuck. Hm. Okay, uh... What... are you doing? I just thought... Yeah. So you... You thought that the two of us would... Yeah, I mean, just 'cause your texts, and up on the lift. So... Yeah. Yep. Uh... Uh... Okay, uh, yeah... Mm... I'm sorry. Mm. - You don't need to... - I shouldn't have... This is the stupidest thing I have ever done. Um... Hmm. - I apologize. - No, stop. You shouldn't be apologizing. Margrethe, this is... Look, this is probably my fault as well. I'm sorry if I was giving you any mixed signals or whatever. I don't know, but I didn't mean to lead you on. That's really not what I wanted. So, you see? You're like... It's just... I mean, you've always been like a little sister to me. Okay. Okay, Margrethe, I have an idea. What if we just forget about this. Pretend it never happened. Margre... Margrethe? I just wanted to let you know that I'm heading over to Ingrids. So I'm hoping I'll see you there. FROM INGRID HOW WAS...? Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Funk! Fuck! Redcurrants with cream. - Margrethe, hey! - Hi. What's up? Alexander said you'd already gone to bed, so I... - Yeah, well we need to talk. Over here? - Oh. Okay. - What's wrong? Did something happen? - Yes, something happened. It's your fault! Huh? What are you talking about? I'm talking about how you're always saying everyday things like, "You gotta go for it," or like, "He's into you," or, "He wants you." Or, "Don't be Princess 'I Don't Want To.'" Sorry. I was just trying to help you. "Trying to help me?" Don't you see that it fucks with my head? Can't you just calm down and tell me what happened? Oh sure. Of course that's what's on your mind, did I get laid? If I got fucked. If I slept with him. If I popped my fucking cherry or whatever the hell. Is that what you think? You think that's all I care about? What am I supposed to think? Not when you fucking talk about it all the fucking time. Are... Are you that stupid? Can you think about anything else? Does everything have to just go in one ear and out the other? Like, oh my God. Where do you get off, Ingrid? Just give me some fucking space! Get off my case. - I can't breathe without you down my back! - Okay, fine then! I'll give you some space. FROM GUSTAV I HEAR YOU'RE IN HEMSEDAL. I AM AT STAVKROA, COME HERE! - How's everyone doing? - Hey. - What the fuck? What's up? - Hi. - Good to see you. - Yeah, uh... I didn't think that you'd come. - Can we talk somewhere? - You want anything? Yeah, sure. I, uh... - Do you wanna come inside, or... - No, no, uh... No? So, I don't... What... What am I supposed to... Like, what do you want me to do for... I don't understand, uh, what... what you wanna... for you to delete that... video? Look, you don't have to do anything honestly. But, maybe we could, uh... grab a ride and go back to my place so we can continue where we left off. Does it turn you on, pressuring girls for sex, or what the fuck? - Is that your thing? - No, it's not. - No. No, that's not. - Forcing yourself on people? What the fuck? - Are you insane? - Then what's wrong with you? That's... You're out of your mind. Seriously? Well, maybe I prefer being a crazy virgin for the rest of my life than sleep with a pathetic asshole like yourself. What an asshole! Excuse me. Let me through. - I'm afraid I can't, ma'am. - Why not? First off, the line starts there. - Yeah, I see it. - Secondly, you're way too drunk. - Okay, I'm going... - No, no. Stop. Do you know who I am? Yeah, yeah, I'm aware of who you are, Your Highness. - Right, then. - But you are still drunk, you see? So the best thing to do is for Your Majesty to go home and go get yourself some water. Okay. What the fuck? This is not fucking cool. This is crazy. Hey! Are you okay? Are you lost? Hold on. Aren't you the Princess of Norway? What... What are you doing here? Or... I mean, Your Majesty. Um, does Your Majesty need some help? Sure. Want me to drive you home? No, but you can drive me back to your place. And then we can fuck. Huh? Yeah, you heard what I said. You can't be serious. This is a joke, right? No. Well, I'm sorry, but I actually need to go home, - I can drop you off... - Never mind, then. Hey, you shouldn't be out there alone. Hey, Your Royal... Hey, Your Royal Highness. Hey, you can't just run off like that! - Hey, careful, there's water and rocks... - Oh! Shit! - Watch it, you could fall. - That's crazy. Okay, a girl like you, you can't just run off. No? Look, I'm gonna give you a ride home, okay? TO JENS I'M SLEEPING AT INGRID'S WILL YOU TELL MOM AND DAD? FROM JENS OKAY. ENJOY YOURSELF. Hey, what... what are you... Hey. Hey! Hey, I don't think that's very smart of you. Okay? But, uh, yeah. My place is a little, uh... a little messy. But I'll take the couch and you can have the bed. Just let me get it ready, okay? So, uh... Hey! Hey! Just relax already. I'm not trying to be mean, but you're drunk right now. I'm not drunk. - Stop. Yes you are. - I'm not drunk at all. Listen, the bed's ready. You want some water... maybe? - Could a drunk person do... this. - No. No, no. Be careful. Please be... I need that, so don't drop it. - Please, okay? - Two seconds. Relax. - Please. Careful with that. - Whoops. Oh. You know you kinda have to sleep with me, don't you? It's the law. It's your consti... Consistu... Consistuti... - Constitutional, okay? - That's it. Your duty. And it doesn't work that way. Got that? All right, then. - Um... - You're not even a little tempted? Am I, like, so unappealing to you? Listen. You're the most beautiful woman in Norway. There's no doubt about that. But doing this would be wrong. You okay? You need some water? All right, hold on. Uh, let me get your hair. Okay, uh... Uh, okay. - What's up? - Hey. - So... - Don't ask. Yeah, sure. - Do I have to ride on that thing with you? - What's wrong? What, I'm not good enough? - No, no, that's not it. - No? - You... It's more than enough. - Hurry up, then. Yeah. There. - Thanks, Arnie. - No worries. No, I, uh... I mean it. Thanks for everything. This was very nice of you to do. Oh, um, those aren't really mine. But that's your bag. Can I just... Do you know how addictive these are, Margrethe? I mean it. They're dangerous. Can you just please not care? Fine. - See you later. - Yeah. Bye. Arnie! - Welcome to visit anytime. - Come here! - Thank you. - So good to see you. - Good seeing you. - This is what we needed. - See you. - See you soon. - Love seeing you. - You too. Thanks. Take care until the next time, okay? I hope I'll see you soon. - Yeah, I'm sure you will. - Mm. Race you to the... ...couch! I'm sorry for interrupting, but, um... I received a call from the communications department regarding a video that has just been leaked. Woo-hoo! The palace has called an emergency press conference with the Princess. Unfortunately, we need to end your trip early. Margrethe? Margrethe? What's wrong? You don't need to say it verbatim. Use your own words. But make sure that you own up to it. I realize that this must be difficult, but try and put on a brave face. Try to think happy thoughts. Yeah, like what? Puppies, kittens, whatever you want, but keep your mind off of this, okay? - Are you okay, Margrethe? - I need a sec. My darling. You nervous? Very much so. It's understandable. Probably feels like your whole world is collapsing right now, but... it's going to be okay. I know it will be, um... Our PR team knows what they're doing. Is that... Is that what you tell yourself when you're fooling around with your mistress? Um... That it will be okay because the PR people will fix it? My mistress? Dad, I know what you're doing. I'm not stupid. There's no mistress. Whatever. I have a lover. A man. - Hmm? - Or at least, I had a lover. A boyfriend. His name is Martin. And he's the reason why I've been gone so much lately, because he's dying of... cancer. Does Mom know? Yeah. So is that why... Is that the reason you guys are so fucked up all the time? The reason you guys are... Is because Dad's gay? I mean, this whole time... - Margrethe. - So Is that why? That's why I'm so fucked up all the time? Because you two have been lying to me so much. - You lied to me! - I know. - You lied to me! - No, we've never lied to you. My whole life! Listen, your mother and I, we love each other very much. We're trying to help you, dear. Margrethe. Yeah. I mean... Like you did at the hospital. That really was... Yeah, that was super helpful. I'm sure we could've handled that better, but, um... You also need to know the pressure we're under. It's not like we're normal people. We don't get to live like them. But you've got this. Sweetheart. You're the strongest of us. It'll be okay. - I have to... - I'll walk you over. - Princess Margrethe? - Yeah. Just remember to breathe with your stomach and do as we practiced earlier, okay? Princess. Princess. Does Your Highness have an addiction? Will the princess apologize to the Norwegian people? Princess. Is the leaked video the reason for the hospitalization? Please hold. The princess will make her statement, then answer any questions you have. First of all, I would like to express how sorry I am for everything that has happened. Um... I would like to apologize to... to the people of Norway and... and to my family. I promise that I will never let it happen again. But it's just that I, um... I mean, I feel... just so stressed out. Wait. Not stressed, but... scared. I feel scared all the time. Of all kinds of stuff. And I feel so lonely. And all of the drugs and alcohol were... were making me feel just like everyone else. Like I was someone cooler, who's way better and smarter, but I... I'm not. Trust me, I'm not. I've tried. It's just me. I am Margrethe. So that's it. That's all I have to say, so... Thank you all. - Princess? - Is the princess addicted? Because the princess has had a hard time of late, she wishes to have her privacy respected. - Hello. Hi. - Hi! - Uh! - Mm. How does it feel? Very scary, but felt good. - That was brave. - Thank you, guys. - I'm proud of you. - Thank you. - Answer it. - That must've been scary. You did great. Hello? Yeah, well some people call me DJ Arnie. Well, it's a little scary. I think the PR lady, like, hates me. - You think so? - Yeah. - response was fantastic. - There's people behind you. What's up? - Dude. - What happened? Um, I was just asked to open up for TÖS, guys. - Wow. - Seriously? - What? - Oh my God. - No. I'm serious. For real. - Are you serious? Wow. - Arnie! - Oh my God. - Yes! - Insane. Hey, congrats, man! Can we come too? Oh yeah, you're coming. Backstage and everything. Hi. Oh, hey. - I just wanted to say... - Isn't Arnie's news great? I'm sorry, what... did you want to say? I want to apologize to you for Hemsedal. Don't worry about it. It's okay. No, it's not. What I did was... You are not dumb. Yeah, maybe I'm not, but I'm not exactly the smartest either, so... The reason why I did that... why I tried to be above you... was because you're better than me. - No. - Yeah, yes you are. - No, I'm not. - You really are. - No. - Come on. You're a good friend. You're so patient. Everyone loves you. You're so kind. You're creative, caring. I mean, you're like... everything I wish I was. Can you forgive me? Of course I'll forgive you, idiot. - Do you mean it? - I do. Oh. Math class. Math class. Should we skip? What? I'm already an awful role model, and you're going to fail Math anyway. Honestly, good point. - Did you get to hear the latest gossip? - No, what's up? Fanny's got a girlfriend now. - Wow. - Mm-hmm. A senior. - What? - Mm-hmm. I thought Arnie and Fanny had a thing. Oh, they don't. Really? Yeah, at least they don't anymore. I see. Think the two of them might've been a one time thing, so... Hm. I also wanted to apologize to you. For what? For pressuring you so much. Shut up. It's all right. You're forgiven. Thank you. It's just... I thought, with everything you've been going through, that it might help take your mind off things if you had a boyfriend, or... But now I've said it out loud, I realize how stupid it actually sounds, so... Stop. But... I don't always know what to do when you keep everything so locked up. Hi. Hi. I understand if you're disappointed in me, but I had to do it. I'm not disappointed in you. You're not? No. Then, what's wrong? It's Martin. He's, uh... Is he gone? Mm-hmm. Oh. Hey. Tomorrow, there's a memorial for him. You have to go. I can't. You can. Isn't it your turn to be the brave one here? I'm afraid it's just not that easy. Actually it is, Dad. Come here. Oh, I'm so sorry. Why? What for? That your mother and I suck so much. - No, you don't. - Yeah, we do. Okay, maybe you do, but like, not all the time, okay? I'm doing okay. I'm in control. Are you sure? Pretty sure. - I love you, Dad. - I love you. Thanks, but I'm sticking to drinks with less alcohol in them. - Come on! - That's it! - Woo! - Woo-ooh-ooh! Ah. Thank you. Hey, who booked this party bus? Yeah, it was Margrethe. - Seriously? - Yeah. Margrethe has her contacts. Yeah, I mean, I didn't mean it like that, I just... - You're not usually the type to... - The type to... Uh, to... You know, let loose. I don't know. But I always assumed that you thought that things like this party bus would've been beneath you. Like, this isn't a fancy party where you hold the glass by the stem. That's fine by me. I doubt anyone knows how to drink from a stemmed glass anyways, But I have something for you. THE QUEEN Look at that. Well deserved and a perfect fit. You just need to work on one thing. Keeping my brother in check. Other than that, we're good. Thanks for this. Okay, people. Let's dance. Come on. Let's go! Cheers! Hello? Arnie, hey! What's going on? Sound check okay? I don't know. Was sound check okay? Like, I don't know, so... I'm sorry, but... Sorry, but I can't do it. I don't have any business being on that stage. Wait, what? Calm down. Everything's gonna be great. But what if it's not? Then it'll all go to shit. But what if I'm not good enough. I'll just embarrass myself. But you are. What are you talking about? You're good good, Arnie. They're all gonna love you. I'm sorry, but I can't. Just tell the others for me, okay? Wait. Arnie? - Hi. - Hello? I'm looking for my, uh, friend. He's supposed to be playing, actually. He's opening for you. Mm. - Um, DJ... Yeah! - DJ Arnie. Yeah, yeah, yeah. - You seen him? - He's cute, isn't he? But have you seen him? Wait a second. Do I know you? Maybe. Have we... - You're asking if... No. - Are you sure? - Yeah. - Margrethe? Why are you here? I'm here to rescue you this time. You can't back out from this. It's just a gig, though. Okay. Maybe it is just a gig, and you're allowed to back out if you really want to, but... But not just because you're scared right now. I mean, you're too good for that. But this is, like, a legit show. So far, it was just for fun. I don't belong on the same stage as TÖS. - What? Come on. The ladies love it. - Don't be stupid, man. I think you'll crush them. You are a hundred times more charming than that guy. TÖS. Do you mean it? Yeah. Okay. I'm coming with. All right, right, right. Gonna get started with our headliner. I promise, TÖS is gonna give you the night of your lives. But first, let's kick off our evening with a young, fresh up and comer. DJ Arnie! Arnie! Arnie! Arnie! Are we feeling alive yet? Hey, hey. Sorry, technical difficulties. We'll be... We'll be back soon.
