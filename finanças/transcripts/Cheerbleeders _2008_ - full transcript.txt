How does it feel to be the least popular girl in school? (girls laugh) Hey girls! Okay. See you later. They must not have heard me. Yeah, that's it. What's up? My report's today. Check this out. It's this. Whoa. Now that's hardcore. My great grandfather was an archeologist and they found that in his office after some local slaughtered him. Rad. It's for my report.

And, I, Priestess Penny call Dionysus to roar there, too, as it were a thunder underground born on the air. Heavy with dread. (girl clears throat) Yes. I don't think it's appropriate to be subjected to pornographic cult rituals in a history class. Was there a question in there? (class bell rings) [Teacher] That's class. Nice dress, fag. Do I turn you on? (ominous music plays) (gargling) Rand- Randy! (Randy laughs) Fuck you, Randy! You kiss your mom with that mouth? (ominous sound cues) Oh, Devon is so loyal and nice. (ominous sound cues) Hey Devon. Do you wanna go to the game with me on Friday? Ha ha ha. Devon. Are you okay? No. What is this shit that I'm covered in? Hey Devon. Look, Casey. I don't know what you and your friends are trying to pull but I'm not having a very good day. So, I'd appreciate if you'd walk head long into traffic. Thank you. What was that? (car crash sounds) Blackwood High School's homecoming nearly started in tragedy when a car struck junior, Casey Brownfield, at the corner of Walker and Fisher. She just walked right on past me and walked right into the traffic. I don't, I don't know why. Right now we're all just praying Heavenly Father will pull her through. She wasn't supposed to take me literally! But she did. What other girls saw you covered in that goo? Well, you saw me. No. I said the words. I don't count, I'm the priestess. Well, Judy and Wendy saw me. Devon is so trustworthy. It's the cheerleaders. Devon is way hardcore. And cute. And Christie. (angelic sound cues) Hi! Hi. Gross! So, what, I can control these girls now? What should we do? We test them motherfucker.

I need people to like me. Get in the house! I'm going to get you. (animal growling) (Penny gasps) (intense drum music plays) Blood orgy? (school bell rings) Hi, Christie. (school bell rings) Dude, what's with your truck. (Christie moaning) Get your hands off her, fag. Fight! (punk music plays) (students cheering) (punches land) (animal growling) (in demonic voice) Leave him the fuck alone. I love Devon now, okay? You're so dead. What did you do to Christie? - I didn't do anything. That doesn't happen by itself. Listen, I think I know how to reverse what I've done to you. No way, Penny. I feel great. Fucking fantastic. Tonight, there's gonna be a blood orgy. I'm gonna be a king of this school. Listen to yourself. This isn't the Devon I know. The Devon you knew was pathetic and nobody liked him. I thought he was hardcore. (crowd cheering) [Announcer] At two minutes to the half, the Broncos are trailing the Tigers by 13. (cheerleaders cheer) [Announcer] Number 8, Randy Dayton, hit hard. Number 84 Bowen Lopez with the sack. What the hell is wrong with you, Randy? Get your head in the game! [Announcer] And, that's halftime. Idaho Falls, 16, Blackfoot, three. (tribal drum music plays) For your halftime entertainment, The Blackfoot High School marching band and your Blackfoot High cheerleaders. We have a special cheer for you. Hey, Randy. (tribal drum music intensifies) (tigers roaring) (bones cracking) (Penny panting) Call it off, Devon. Not on your life. This whole school is gonna pay. Undo the image of thunder underground.
