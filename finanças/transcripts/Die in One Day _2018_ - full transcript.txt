- Hey. Are you okay? Are you okay? - What the fu... â™ª Ha, ha, ha ha, haa - I know. I know. I start my new job in a week. You'll get your money back. Thanks. Do you remember me? I've missed you so much. So much. Hey, slow down. I brought you a whole packet. It's okay. - Stay here, I'll be right back. Richard. - Paige. - Spit that out! I'm not going to waste my money on medicine if you get a stomach ache. - You make me sick. Eight years, eight years ago you took her away from me and for what? So she can live in this dump? And if that wasn't enough, she still doesn't say a word. Now that's all going to change. - What's this? - It explains just how bad a mother you actually are. You do realize they're coming to pick her up. - I've never seen a social worker around here. - I will not allow my daughter to be taken into care. Come on, Mindy. - What do you think you're doing? - She's coming with me! - She's not going anywhere! - Why the fuck are you pissing off my woman? - I just want my daughter back. I can give her a future. Next week I'm starting a new job, a good job. - Just leave. - Paige, just listen to me. - Are you deaf? Get the fuck out of here. - You've tattooed her name. Well I hope for you, it's not permanent. - You talk too much. I am going to count to three. One, two, three! - Okay. Okay, I'm leaving. I'll be back, sweetheart. I promise. Another one. - Make it a double and I'll have a beer. Bad day? It's on me. - I'm Richard. - To Richard and Sasha, the strangers. - Is it that obvious? - Nobody here goes around on a rented bicycle. So, what brings you here? - Family matters. Unpleasant family matters. - Well, if it's any consolation, who doesn't have them? - Yeah, life shits on everybody, but with me, it had diarrhea. I've made so many mistakes in my life, now I want to put things right. I don't know where to begin. - Are we talking about a broken heart? - No, the end of my relationship was one of the few good things that happened to me. Today my heart beats for just one person. And I'm happy to say, she feels the same way too. - Oh, she's beautiful. Is this your daughter? - Her name is Mindy. And I need to get her back at all costs. - Do you want to talk about it? Come on, I can help you take your mind off things for a while. - You're not one of those... - No, of course I'm not. - Okay. - To Mindy. - To Mindy. I haven't enjoyed myself this much since, I can't even remember the last time. Perhaps this is what we really need, the simple things in life, without ulterior motives. Like tonight. Thank you. - Why don't you hire a lawyer? A good one. You are her father. A lawyer could help to get her back. - Sasha, I'm still paying back the debts my ex-wife ran up. I don't know when I'll be able to afford a lawyer. What an idiot. - I can help. I can help to get the money you need. - Yeah, right. - 25,000. - What? - 25,000 euro. Is that enough? - What are you talking about? - Tomorrow there is a new theatrical format nearby, where a group of aspiring actors will be closed inside a theater for 24 hours, a whole day of pure improvisation with no script. It's incredible and the best part is, the actor who gives the best performance wins the cash prize. - That sounds too good to be true. - But it is. I've been chosen to take part and you could come with me tomorrow morning. - Why would they let me take part? I mean, I don't even know how to act. - Come on, I'm sure they'll give you a chance because well, I don't think it's actually legal seeing as I found it looking for easy money in the deep web. - If it's illegal, how do you know they'll pay you? - I think there must be some clandestine gambling. I'd have more doubts if it was legal. Just give it a try. When will you get another occasion like this? What do you have to lose? - Morning. - Good morning. - Well, are you coming with me? This should be the place. Sorry, it's my fault, but he's perfect for the show. He's an outsider too, he's... What? - I can see him. We need to make a change. - Listen, are you sure about this? And I didn't like the look of that guy. - Be a little more optimistic and everything will work out fine. It's called the law of attraction. - Yeah, if you say so. - I told you that... Ah right, the rules. See? Not that bad. - Well, certainly better than the outside. - Hey guys, come over here. I'm Debbie. - I'm Richard. - Sasha, pleased to meet you. And you? - Kurt. - Uh, where are you from? - It's not important where I'm from, but where I'm headed. And you? Where are you from? - I'm English. - And you? - Ukraine. - That's not a joint, is it? - It's not important what it is, but how it smokes. Why don't you get a life. - Uh, calm down. - Move, get down! Everybody goes to the center of the stage. You, on your knees. I said on your knees! - What's going on? - Shut the fuck up! Look at me. Look at me! - No, no, please. - This is a fucking farce. - Well done. A wonderful performance, but let me introduce myself. I'm the director and my audience greatly appreciated this little introduction and they want to see more, so please, continue. - Did you hear that? They're giving me compliments. Did you see my performance? - Performance? You nearly shit yourself. Oh no, please. Eh, fuck this bullshit. I'm leaving. - Come on, let's go. - You have just met mask number one and mask number two, who together with three other masks will form the team of hunters. So please, accept my apologies for not having been completely sincere with you. But then again, without a little deception, there would have been no fun for our audience. - What the fuck's going on? - I don't know. - Ladies and gentlemen, you are the actors of future. I am pleased to inform you, that thanks to this opening performance, the winner's prize has increased to 100,000 euros, which will be divided by those who manage to stay alive until tomorrow morning. However, in order to win the money, you, the prey, have to eliminate the team of hunters. But the hunters will share the money if they manage to eliminate all of you. On one condition, they have to take their time and be creative in order to make the show more entertaining. And you as their prey, should know that we have cameras everywhere. - We're not safe here. - So searching for a hiding place is pointless. - We need to get out. - Wait. Wait. Didn't you hear him? - Welcome to the one, the only, theatrical team death match. Die in one day. Let the massacre begin. - Jesus, you're frightening. - If you think about it, we have an advantage. - Which is? - Like he said, they can't kill us right away. - Your definition of advantage leaves a lot to be desired. - I know it's brutal, but... - Listen. I have no intention of getting killed, not now nor later. - Fuck, fuck. - Hey. - Hey, over there. What I was trying to tell you is we have a chance to win the money. - Shit. Fuck. Fuck. - Richard, I'm being serious. - So am I. I was always told to keep out of trouble. - It's a lot of money. Think about Mindy. - What's happening? - Come on. Debbie? - Do you think we should help her? - Look. Debbie! - Run, Sasha, run! - Fuck. - Communication to the hunters, a bonus will be awarded if you manage to eliminate one of the two remaining contestants in the next few minutes. But remember, it has to be done with style. - You've tattooed her name. Why him? Tell me. Why him? What the fuck does all this mean? Fuck. Fuck! - Fuck. - Come on you fucking freak. Bring it on! - Richard? - Don't touch me. Stay away from me. This, what does it mean? - It's... - You knew about this from the start and you set me up. - I can explain. - What? What can you explain? - It's not what you think. I mean, yes, I knew who you were, and I did everything to get you to take part, but I swear, I didn't know that this would happen. I thought it was just a game. I know, I made a mistake. With the letter too. I did it for Mindy. - Leave my daughter out of this! - She may be your daughter, but she's also my sister. My name is Sasha, short for Alexandra. Paige is my mother. I'm her first child. - I knew she'd been married before in Russia... - Ukraine. - I didn't know she had a daughter. - Of course you didn't. When I was 13, she sold me to start a new life. When I finally found her six months ago, I discovered that I had a sister. We immediately became close. I go to visit her every time she's alone. And she is also so sweet, so innocent. I swore to myself that what happened to me would never happen to her. And I tried everything to get her away from Paige, but it was useless. Please, forgive me. I just wanted to improve our chances of winning. - Sasha... - Richard! You. - Me. We are not that different. I do it for the money too. - You're nothing but a sick bastard. - Yeah, I'm a sick fuck. And you know what I'm going to do when I win? I will sell that little bitch to the first pedo I can find. But, your mother was wrong about one thing. She said you weren't a worth shit compared to your sister, but today, you are worth a fortune. - For you two, money is never enough. - Shh, shh, shhh. Now it's your turn. - Stop. If there is one thing I can not stand, it is seeing my simple rules being broken. You can not eliminate one of your teammates. My audience isn't paying for this. They are paying to enjoy the show. - Fuck you and fuck your rules! I want my... - Run. Run. - I bet you are thinking about Mindy right now. So am I. - Go to fucking hell. - Sasha. - I don't want to die. I don't want to die. - Finally alone, eh? Eh bitch?! - Debbie! Richard! Did you like the show, mother fuckers? The day we give them back to each other again will be the day I take you away from here. I'm here to report a missing person. - When? - When? When she went missing? Uh, this morning or perhaps yesterday. I'm not sure. - Fill this in. - You should be ashamed of yourselves. Forget it. I'll go elsewhere, assholes. - Hello? - I served her up to you on a plate and you didn't manage to kill her. I also lost Vinnie. I want compensation now. - You will receive much more than you can possibly imagine. We are taking the show to the next level. - And what makes you think she'll come back? - Oh, she'll come back. Because she is the best player we ever met. And you, you are going to sell me what she is looking for.
