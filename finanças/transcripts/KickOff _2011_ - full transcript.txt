All right. Fuck sake, Joey. Jesus Christ. Sorry. Is that Madonna? Gary Whatever it is, it's too gay. Sorry. Archie, I'm sorry. This is a match, mate. Not a Pride march. Archie, there's no one here. FLOYD: Skank. MARCO: Fag hoe. FLOYD: Flirt. MARCO: Control freak. FLOYD: Hole. You are driving me mental. Just wait 'til I get you home. Stupid bloody queers. Ahh, oh my god. You like the feel of a roaring beast between your legs? Oh my God. You can call me Floyd, baby. All right, Joey, baby! JOEY: Hey, all right, man. Looking good enough to get a brudda in trouble. Floyd, mate, a word. Hey, you girls swap makeup tips while a man's got to do, yeah. Yo. Who the fuck is that little queen? Hey! Your boyfriend. You know what they say, man. If you can't remember their names, it's time to slow down. I'm not talking about Joey. I'm talking about that little screamer Oh, with the pink helmet who was riding my pillion. Oh, that little queen. Oh, that's just... Shit, it really is time to slow down. Hey look, do me a favor, yeah? Go and introduce yourself and get his name for us. Look, my brain cells have not been the same since Friday, that, you know what I'm saying? So, is Joey short for anything like. No. Ah, shame. Is Benji short for Benjamin? No. Oh. Oh! Tha! So, let me make sure I've got this down. Having my boyfriend along to support me is a problem? Boyfriend? Boyfriend. No inverted commas boyfriend, problem? It is if your so-called boyfriend is a total giveaway who is gonna bring us all grief. So far, all the grief's coming from you. I see your piece is here. Joey is not my piece, thanks. He's my... Boyfriend? Partner. You're shagging. Not opening a restaurant together? Well, that pretty little queen with his batty hanging out is your boyfriend, brov, and you are a batty boy whether you like it or not. Joey is not a queen. I'm not into queens. Gay means you're into men. It don't mean we all have to be queens, does it? It means we can be whatever the fuck we want to be, as far as I'm concerned. Well, if you wanna be a queen, you can be a queen on your own time. This is my time. Mate, this is soccer! This is lethal, savage, caveman shit and queens will not be tolerated. Queens will get a kicking! Well, speak for yourself, mate. This queen does the kicking. It's a new, fucking day, okay? Ladies, what's with all the drama? Why do queens always have to be creating, man? We are not bloody queens. We're a football team. A queer football team. A football team that happens to be Queer! Gay! What, we're queer now? Archer, man, you were the one that advertised for a gay team. And blow me, pun intended if some of them don't turn out to actually look gay. None of you looks gay. He looks gay. Archer, man. Oh, well, trust me I looked pretty gay last night with my tongue up his... Floyd! And loads of it all over my face. My smiling, satisfied face. So, yeah, I guess gay really does mean happy. So, fuck you, you fucking era wannabe Nazi! Look, I can just go. No, don't you fucking go no place, babe, yeah. See this? This is what gay looks like. A bloke with a boyfriend. And if my boyfriend goes, I go. So I hope your straight partner over there can kick a ball, mate. Otherwise, you're one man down. Kick a ball? Boyfriend? Piss off! For god sakes will you piss off! Please. Hi. Oh my God, sister, I've got a boyfriend. What have I missed? And he plays football, I'm a WAG. We're having a meeting on team policy. I.E. whether we're a gay team or not. Duh, have we looked in the mirror lately? Skin tight vests. Leather catsuits. Piercings. And them shorts. Trust me, we're a gay team whether we wanna be or not. MAN: And why wouldn't you want to be? Oh man. I thought this was officially a gay team. Don't tell me the literature lied. Sorry, you left your boots in the car, sorry. What the fuck are you doing? There's no need for language, potty mouth. I just want to see you play your first game. You won't even know I'm here. Down low, low key. I'm even wearing a hoodie. I am not here. Now, who's hungry? I bought power snacks. Yeah, yeah. Allow me some snacks. Great, another boyfriend. Boyfriend? He's not my boyfriend. I'm the dad. Foster dad. But I'm not here. Now, let's get this straight. This is a gay team, yeah. You all are batty riders, yeah. 'Cause this is supposed to be a supportive environment. Who's the captain? Theoretically... Archer George, wow. You know me? Come on, know you? You were only Scunthorpe United's brightest hope. For five minutes. Five fabulous minutes. Went on as a sub in injury time and scored two goals. Lucky shot. Before mysteriously... dropping out of sight. I thought you joined the army. Oh my god, you're a queen. I'm not a... Now it all makes sense. How could I not have known? Look at you. Archer George, rah. Maddox, listen to everything this gal says, yeah. And no back chat. She knows her shit. Sorry, carry on, I'm not here. Carry on? I presume you're about to go through match strategy. Strategy. So, I've Googled the competition. And most of the other teams are pen pushing pussies and rugger bugger yuppies. So we're fine as long as we're not playing the Bethnal Reapers. Cute to look at in a rough trade sort of way, but, let's face it, those bitches is crazy. I mean, come on, it's only a football match, not world war. What? It's not good breedings to give your mother the hairy eyeball, kitten. Why you always gotta show me up? Who's showing who up now? Tessie Tantrum! Ignore her, adolescence is a bitch and so is my kid. Actually, he's got a point about you showing him up. Yeah, listen to him, Max, she knows her shit. Like that top you're wearing with the... thingy shoulders. Spaghetti straps. How old are you exactly? Old enough to still wear spaghetti straps and look better than you look in anything, sonny, including that tired baby butch haircut. Old enough to have forgotten more about football than you'll ever learn. And young enough to kick your butt from here to Wembley Stadium. How old is that, would you say? Okay, I'm not gonna argue with you. I was raised to respect my elders. I'm just trying to look out for me players. It's one thing you want turning up looking like a slapper, but your dad? I mean, it ain't like anyone else's dad's here, is it? No, no, no Max, where...where you going? Max! Max! What? I wish my dad would come and watch me play. I wish my dad would let me in the house. Hey, hope you brought your boots, brov. Max, Max, where're you going? Who cares? I'm going, aren't I. Your bitch, is my command. Max, Max. Dad. Shouldn't that be foster dad? Will you come to watch me play in there? What, and show you up in there? Well, if you don't show me up than who will? Actually, you know what? You're right, fuck this. Mouth. What are you doing, child? I'm fucking this off. Mouth! We didn't spend the last year searching for a gay team so that we could get queer batter by the captain. Bollocks to him, he's a twat. And I didn't spend 80 odd quid on them boots so that you can flounce out of yet another team, princess. Don't tell me you thought of less bitching on a gay team. At least, there is a gay team. When I was 17, back in the stone age, there was nothing. They crucified the one gay pro soccer player there ever was. There was a professional gay soccer player? Justin Fashanu. First million pound, black player. It wasn't a happy ending. The world wasn't ready. They drove him to suicide. Who's got the guts to find out if they're ready now? Everyone flips out because Beckham wore a sarong over his jeans. So yeah, your captain's a twat, but at least he's a gay twat, who's trying to keep you alive. So, I guess that's progress, innit, as the young people say. Max, have you ever fostered a kid before? Is this a trick question? I hate trick questions. No. Well, I've been fostered like eighteen times, yeah. This is my last go at being someone's son and you're my first real dad. Yeah, I wanna stay alive, but while I'm here, I wanna make my dad proud. I wanna get good at this. I wanna be the first out gay Chinese million dollar player. And I want my dad to watch. Innit, dad? Daddy. Pops. Maybe I'll catch the first couple of minutes. Cool. Oh, wear your hoodie, yeah. Well, what do you lad want me to do? Lie? I'd settle for you not acting like a puckered wreck to them, but that's just me. Ain't no need to be slagging people's parents, Archer, man. If you'd slagged my dad like that, I would've laid you out. You hate your dad. That's right. That job's taken. Archie, what if he don't come back? MADDOX: Don't embarrass me. You all right, man? He's fine, I'm not here. Captain. Oh, am I still captain, then? [ALL SIGHING IN DISGUST] Drama queen. It's called the past, Archie. Archer. So, I'm still captain. ALL: Yes. Okay, firstly, I'm not trying to push no one back into the cupboard or nothing. ALL: Closet. But this is our first match. Our first match as a team after one training session. And I say, we at least try and establish ourselves as a force to be reckoned with in this league before we start skipping about in ballet slippers and blowing kisses. Look, all I'm asking is that we and our supporters just keep a low profile and focus on the football. Is that reasonable? Now, the team we're up against generally plays a nice, clean game. Their striker's a good sprinter. Maddox in defense needs to keep him dancing and use a paulie's puff. He's pretty much a straight shooter, no puns please. Always strikes a clean line from his toe to the back of the net. So Marco, don't think tricksy. Just dive where he aims and fast. It's got velocity. Floyd, their midfielder has the potential to be a bit leery. Don't let him trip your switches. Play his end game and you'll run rings around him. Basically, if we all stay focused, pass the ball, share the work load, keep formation we can tuck this fucker under our arms and carry it home. What? Now what? For a second there, you almost sounded like a captain. Don't let me lure you into a false sense of security. At the Peckham Pandas, there's a lot to be trifled with. [LAUGHS] Peckham Pandas. I'm warning you don't be fooled by the name, 'cause the Pandas... Ain't no teddy bears. Right, on the pitch. Let's get warmed up. What are we called, by the way? Platoon FC. Fabulous, ain't it? I like it. Nobody says fabulous for the next hour, all right? And what do we chant? Up the Platoon. We don't chant. No chanting, all right? No chanting. No calling each other babe. And you, wear that, yeah. Joey, where's the strip? Lout. Thinks he's so sexy. What does FC stand for anyway? You might be more comfortable on here, love. Thanks, but I've already got a boyfriend. I'll struggle to restrain myself. I'll just be over here, Floydie. That's my boyfriend. What the fuck is this? It's what we agreed on. It's pink. Nuh-uh, it's fuchsia. It's fucking pink. Oh, fuchsia strip, nice. Nice? Cute, but I'm not here. Cute? It's supposed to be a fucking football strip. Who's this one supposed to be for? It's yours. Mine? How the fuck is this supposed to be for me? These are all fucking fuchsia doll's clothes. They stretch and you said fuchsia was fine. 'Cause you told me fuchsia was the color of rage and passion, not raging fucking pansies. You go girl. It's like a fucking crop top. I knew I should've got my belly button pierced. Let's have a try on mine, yeah. Where the shorts? Oh god, the shorts. Oh my days. Get some! Get some! [YELLING] I'm totally wearing these to walk to school in, man. This will fuck them up. Group shot, group shot. Say cheese! ALL: Cheese! Hey man, what happened to dinner and a movie? [CLICKS] Ahh... Uhh, huh. Oh, oh, oh. No, I like mine, I'm keeping it. ARCHER: Come here, you irritating... This is my color, man. Come here. [CLICKS] You stupid, silly, dizzy little queens. This is not a fucking joke. This is fucking serious. This is fucking football. And all I'm asking for is one fucking hour at trying it like a fucking team. Just act like a team. Archie. Put some clothes on. who the fuck are you lot? We're Platoon FC, mate. Who the fuck are you? We're the Bethnal Reapers. You are? MAX: Shit. Who the fuck are you lot? You're supposed to be the Pandas. You are supposed to be the Pandas. Well, we ain't. Neither are we. Are we, babes? No babes, you're definitely the Reapers. And we're Platoon. So where the fuck are the Pandas. The Panda's have buggered... Food poisoning. Prawn cocktails at a wedding yesterday. Panda's are out. Well, so the game's out? No, no, no, no, sorry. Turns out the Panda's were actually double booked to play against both your teams. So the food poisoning's a silver lining. You're playing each other. This is bollocks. No, no, no... this is wicked safe. This is your first match, ain't it? Actually, yes, it's me first match proper. ALL: Aw, oh. I've actually shadowed countless matches. Third generation ref. Elton Glixton. Son of Reg, grandson of Dwight. Latest version of the Glixton referee dynasty at your service. Nine minutes to kickoff, gentlemen. Shall we rock and roll? Let's do it. Let's do it. Shit. Oh, sorry pal. You, I see? Yeah, dude, sorry, sorry. Looking for something? Is that your team color, then? What if it is? Just checking against the other team's strip. Oh, making sure it don't clash like. That's well professional. Are your jerseys pink and all then? Fuchsia. There's been a bit of an issue with the jerseys. Issue? Long story, boring. How 'bout we go shirts and skins? Ah, well, like... okay. Right. Team strategy meeting. Now. Dad, I've got the Reapers. Help. So, are we playing in pink shorts and nothing else? Oh, they'll never know we're gay now. Could've at least warned us so we could wax. Will you dizzy Marys shut the fuck up and listen. This is our worst nightmare. That food poisoning fairytale is total... Bullshit. The Panda's are buttoned in. Prawn cocktails, my ass. They just ain't turn up. I wouldn't want to play our sleeve a geezer. Do you know what I mean? See, that's the problem, geezer. No one wants to play us. Ooh. You all right there, brov. All right. Sure, brov. [VOMITS] Sweet. Whatcha mean no one wants to... Shh. Anyone hear sirens or is it me? It's you, Danny. Whatcha mean no one wants to... Shh, shush. It's you, Danny mate. Whatcha mean no one wants to play us? Whatcha mean no one wants to play us? We're on a warning, remember? One more incident of uncalled for drama on the pitch and we're out of league. Out of the league? What is this? English as a foreign language? Out. Alex! Out! You can't be out. We got scouts coming. Well, we're not out, yet. But we will be if there's a repeat of last season. You got scouts coming, from where? David Beckham lookalikes dot com. Are you lot listening? No, Walter Witty. You lot. West Ham. West what? Bollocks. If we do well in the league this year, there will be a scout from West Ham coming down to watch. Bollocks. We've got to send your vocabulary to stretch classes. West Ham scouts? Danny? Stroll on, darlin'. Ian Wright used to play for Dali Damlits. This ain't Dali Damlits. Ryan Giggs was discovered playing in the streets. Woman! Have you been huffing on a crack pipe or what? He were 13 years old and Ryan Gigg's next door neighbor was a fucking football scout. And my cousin's uncle's boyfriend is a West Ham scout who's promised he'll come down and check us out if we do well in the league. So shut it, get on track or I'm pulling my boy out and finding another team. Meeting adjourned. What a bitch. Yeah, she's great, ain't she? West Ham or no West Ham we've got a chance to win this bloody thing and would've done it last year if you would've not got two men out of five sent off for every other game. So let's just focus on getting through this without it turning into Vietnam for once. What're you looking at me for? I'm not looking at you, I've got a lazy eye. Cool, everyone. Cool. Cool. Jense? 'Kay, mate? Huh? Are you cool with a no battering policy? I...I don't know if I am. Them fuckers look hard to me. It blatantly takes bollocks to wear shorts that pink. Do you get me? Fuchsia. Whatever, let's just have a clean game, yeah? No name calling, no headbutting. No pulling knives on people and threatening to shank them as they're about to take free kicks. What are you looking at me for? I'm not looking at you. Look, I don't know who these Platoon fuckers are right. But we've obviously been put up against them for a reason. So whatever you do, don't let them rattle your cage. Don't let them pull your chain. Now let's get our kits on, get warmed up and let's show what the Bethnal Reapers are made of. Yeah? Sweet. Good luck, yeah. [VOMITS] Got my kit there, babes? Ta babes. What you lookin' at? Not you. If you got a problem with me just say it. And we can sort it out right here right now, all right? All right. Now I am looking at you. Are you on the gear again? Yeah. Are you taking steroids? Steroids? You're practically ready for market, mate. I've been my Oatibits. Look, we can't afford no paranoid roid rages, or that, all right, bully beef? If you don't want rage, don't wind me up. Relax, brov. I'm clean. Well then, why am I not allowed to look at you? I'm shy. Sometimes a man just don't want to be looked at. Well at sporting events, Fitz, eye contact may be made. Then I can't be held responsible, innit. How about you then, brov? You back on the blow on the regular or are you still just fucked from last night? You know I get a bit excited before a match, brov. I'm sweet. Go on, walk away from your own brother, you bastard. Yeah, you'd like it if I was a junky, wouldn't you, brov? Then you really could be the perfect brother. Well go on, judge me. But you don't know me, all right? Yeah, I know this much, brov, you're a fucking embarrassment. And what's your story, geezer? Oh! Story, geezer? What's the crap with the disguise? Is that a Muslim thing? Are you a racist, too? Are you on the run again? Oh, so 'cause I'm black, I got to be on the run. Is that it? You ain't black, mate. Brown then, see how you are? Always profiling by the race, race, race. Are you or are you not on the run again? I'm here, ain't I? I dunno. Are ya? Are any of you lot actually here? I'm here, cap. What do you reckon, babes, tucked or... untucked? Untucked. Just remember, go easy, yeah. Go for the gonads. It's the only way. Those Reapers are animals. We're gonna have to concede this? ALL: What? We cannot play the Reapers, all right. We've got a minor on the team. Yeah, and I'm a giraffe, champ, I'm 17. He can take it. His birth parents used to beat him every other day. Twice on Saturdays. These are not nobody's parents. These are the Bethnal Reapers. They're a bunch of psychotic, match up, bloody meatheads. While we're just... Say it. We're just a bunch of poofs. Is that why you bailed out on Scunthorpe United and the army? Terrified someone would suss you ain't a real man. Excuse me, but what the fuck do you think you're talking about? Stay out of it, Joey. No. Archie, I won't stay out of it. He don't know what the fuck he's talking about. You do not know what the fuck you're talking about, pal. Joey. You need to call off your pet chihuahua, before I slap the bitch straight, ya get me? At least he can remember my bloody name you sad bloody man slag. Oh no he didn't. Joey! Okay, Floyd, let's go, I'll give you one punch. Knock me clean out and I won't have laid a hand on you. You want me to count to three? One, two, whoa, I can't believe you just did that. Hit on ma face... C'mmon, you have seen it. Floyd, baby, ain't worth it. Stay still you fucker. You said I could knock you out. You have to go through me, you freaking bully. Aah, what is it with all your issues today, child? Don't tell me you're finally hitting puberty. He fucking loved the army. He had to leave for me, all right. Why? Were the uniforms not pink enough for you, princess? Because my dad was his captain, all right. And when he found out about us, he beat the shit out of me and we had to get out of there or Arch would have killed him, all right. This ain't a one night stand, hangover romance, Floyd. My man gave up everything for me. And anyone who wants to get to him has to go through me. You get me, man? Boo! Aah! You, come here. You are fucking dead. [QUARRELING] Ah! Baby. What the fuck are them lot doing over there? What you should be doing, killer. Warming up. Are you okay? I'm cool. See, he can take it and he can dish it out and so can you. Focus, ladies. Channel your aggression into plan triple A, attack, attack, attack. Now, get those shirts off and take those saint boys out. It's on. Ah woo, ah woo, ah woo! ALL: Ah woo, ah woo, ah woo! Up the Platoon! Danny mate, shouldn't you be doing something for your legs? Sod the legs, Cap. You see the chest on them lot? JENSEN: Oh yeah, mate, them geezers are fit. What are you, gay? We're fit. Yeah, but they got tits. You queer! We've got tits. Yeah, but ours gotta come through our jerseys. So have theirs. They ain't wearing jerseys, they're going skins. Since when? Since I had them arrange it with the referee. Fuck that! Oye! Wassup! I'll call you back. They ain't wearing jerseys. There's a problem with their kit. Oh yeah? [GROWLS] Ditto. [GROWLS] Shit. Size of that. He's all right. What's a few lumps on a chest, innit babe? Babe? What? Pfft! Muscles are so obvious. I like a nice skinny man. Skinny? Lean? Skinny. What the fuck do you think you're playing at, fix your boys, them shirts cost money, mate. [GRUNTS] [GASPING] [WHISTLE BLOWS] Gentlemen, we're already well into your booked hour. All right. Nice effort. Muggin' it. You all right, mate? Ya all right, mate. You're dead. You all right? How ya' do, man? You're dead. Nice shorts, man. Dead meat. All right, mmm, Paco Rabanne? Classic. I hope your life insurance is paid up. All right. Oh, okay. You're fucked. [GROWLS] Ben? Ben! Ben Androukosopolis. Fuck sake, don't speak. Don't fuckin' speak. I know you, geez? Fitz. Fitz Pommeroy. Pommeroy. Ben fucking Androukosopolis. Fitzgerald fucking Pommeroy. Fitzgerald! Ha-ha. Fitzgerald! Ha-ha. What the fuck you doing here, mate? Just a little football team. You know how we do? You, football? Now that's a fucking turnaround, innit, Minnie Mouse? Mighty Mouse, blood. Whatever. Football, since when? Since time, you know. I see you ain't grown none, though. Well, not up anyway. I been going to the gym a bit. Just messin' with ya, blood. Just pulling your chain. Looking good, geez. Scene. Hold this shirt. Ahh. How's your brother? Still incarcerated? You know how he is. Well, you tell him I said hello, yeah? Anyone got any fizzy water? Oye, you know that geezer? That ain't any geezer, mate. That's Ben fucking Androukosopolis. The seventh brother of seven brothers from seven sisters to have his family in Green Lanes. And he's hanging with them? Something tells me these geezers ain't no Pandas, either, mate. Well, he ain't on the team, is he? I'm warning you Fitz, none of your bullshit. Just play football, all right? Ready? Everybody! Ready Fitzgerald? Ha-ha. Ready Fitzgerald? Ha-ha. Bring it! What is it about that team that ain't adding up? Don't ask me, babes. I'm shit at sums. Who the fuck's that queen think he's fooling with the fag hag? Oh, Paco Rabanne, classic, nice. Just because he's gay don't mean he fancies me, necessarily. Do you think? Nobody here's gay, remember? Kingston reckons we got a sister on the Reapers. Let me guess? The smilie one. I thought he was a bit friendly. I'll show him friendly. Bitch. Peace, yeah. Peace. Mate? [WHISTLE BLOWS] Aah, aah. He's taking the piss, isn't he? Suck on that, sister. What, what man? What, ref, what? I think that was a foul. Foul? Well, it looked like a foul to me. What did you call me? Oh ref. I think we both know, don't we that that was a full stop. Sorry, who are you? Oh, apologies, team trainer slash manager Max O'Reilly. Now listen, Efram... Elton. You seem like a nice boy. I'm sure you don't want to get fired on your first day for homophobia. Homophobia? I didn't think so. You see, I don't know if you've noticed, but we're a gay team. A very gay team. And so we're a teensy weensy bit overcompensating. But you see what we're dealing with, don't you, Efram? Elton. Elton. The kind of thugs that used to terrorize people like us and you in school. I think you know what I mean. And so, all we're asking, Efram. Elton. Elton. All we're asking for, on bended kneea, is for a fair crack. What do ya say ref? False start. Who's in charge here, Elton, you or the bully boys? False start. ADAM: Absolute waste, my blood. Nice work, Elton. Owning it, baby. Nice work. Next time, don't get caught. Attack, attack, attack. I'm not here. Must've been something I said. Sorry, mate. Nah, nah, nah, it's all right. Peace, yeah? Ow! Pussy! Wake up! Come on, come on, come on. Think, yeah. [SHOCKED] ALL: Yay, yay! What? We scored, kitten. Oh, whoo, yeah, fab. Ref!

Disallowed how? I'm afraid you fouled on a tackle. He's on my fucking team, you muppet. A foul's a foul, sorry. You... Don't make me go for the yellow card. I will go for the yellow card. I get a yellow card and them fuckers get a false stop? What is this? Fuck Fitz week? You're Fitzgerald Pommeroy? Ah. What do you mean, ahh? Your reputation proceeds you. Speak English before I get African on you. Otherwise known as Fitz the Foul Merchant. They fouled us first. What we supposed to do? Let them kick shit out of us? Take that homophobia lying down, sod that. BOTH: They're what? Are what? Hey, he say something to you, did he? Well. What'd he say? It don't matter. Come on, mate, what'd he say? It was pathetic, anyway. What the fuck did he say? He said, &quot;Suck on this,&quot; &quot;sissy.&quot; So? You are a sissy. Oh, thanks, man. And you're best striker in the league so who gives a shit? You know you ain't gay, geezer. Hah. You got something to say? Like my man here's gay? Your man? Your what? Are you telling me, your man here, with the waxed chest and eyebrows ain't gay? What, you ain't never seen a metrosexual before? Metrosexuals are just homosexuals who ain't met themselves yet. Try saying that, whatever that was, yeah, to his girlfriend, mate. What, that drag queen with the messed up weave? The one who's busy getting jiggy with some dude as we speak? Alexandria! Babes! Woohoohoo. Oye! Get off her! Stop mauling her. Get out of the car! Babes! Get out! Danny, Danny, babes! Alex! Danny! MAN: Take it back, take it back. You coulda caught a fence, that bastard's jacking me ride! No, no, no, fence. All my straighteners are in the back, man. Alexandria. We've been robbed, you thick twat. We've been repoed. Oh, fucking hell. I thought you bought it off your dad's car dealership, Danny, mate. Who do you think repoed it, Einstein? He was giving me 'til I was 21 to get me career on track before he pulled the plug. Yeah, but you're only 20. It's his birthday today. Oh, happy birthday, mate. Ta, mate. Let me call it, babes. He was setting me off. It's only a motor. It's our dream motor, pillock. They've repoed our bleeding dreams. Our bloody mortgage payment's due tomorrow. How are we supposed to pay that? I'll get another job. You've got three jobs already. When are you going to get time for the gym? You gotta be in shape for when you land the endorsements. You gotta keep up your soccer practice. I'll get up early. You already get up at four in the morning now. Call me self indulgent, but I'd like a bloke with enough energy for a shag once in a while. Alex! Maybe we should let the pied a terre go. Maybe we've just living a bit beyond our means. Beyond your means, you mean. I coulda got engaged to Winston Hargreaves. He's just took over his dad's pest control and fumigation business. I could've been minted with a house in Unger, but no, I took the love option. And what have I got? A riverside flat screaming out for proper click flooring and a repoed motor. Aah... Alexandrea, babes! You'll get wrinkles. We're over this. We are? We have to be. We're in the middle of a match. I'm getting the shit kicked out of me by homophobic meatheads. I need my manager. Homophobic meatheads? Fitz. Not me, them. What's she looking at me for? Well, what's the ref doing about it then? Ref! Me? Are you not party to the recent FIFA crackdown on homophobic abuse, then? I thought pretty boy here weren't supposed to be gay. He ain't. Excuse me? You don't have to be gay to get called names. But it helps. Are you just gonna stand by for all this or are you gonna do something? What did he call you, Danny? He called me a sissy. Actually, I called him a sister. A sister? Well, you had a confession, now what? Well... Are you gonna combat queer bating and meet macho bullshit head on or are you gonna be another authority figure who lets it all slide? You ain't exactly butch yourself, love. You can't be no stranger to bully boy tactics. Who's gonna stand up for all the pretty boy nerds who've been caught in the homophobic overspill if it ain't you? Yellow card. ALL: Yeah You can't be serious? What about my goal? Ah, disallowed. Have you fucking lost it? I'm the referee, see referee and what I say goes. Now, are we gonna get back to the game or stand here bantering until what's left of your hour runs out completely? This one's for you, babes. [MOANS IN PAIN] Have I got this right? Our team's just been penalized for gay bashing? How cool is that? What's the matter? Oye, Jense. Ref, just one more minute, yeah. Brov, brov. Why does the word brother always ring a warning bell when it comes from you? Don't be like that, brov. I'm your brov, brov. Jensen, what the fuck is going on? Well, I was just thinking, you know the other team, yeah? You know the way they're all hyped up? Yeah. I reckon they might be on something, brov. I mean, have you seen their eyes and that. They're coming up on one, brov. You reckon? Proper shit faced on one. On one. So maybe, maybe our strategy, yeah, could be like to even up the score. Do you know what I mean? Like as in, get like Shit faced? Brov, brov! I was gonna say something else, but that is genius, brov. Like fight fire with fire, yeah. What the fuck happened to you, brov? You used to be our secret weapon. You used to be beautiful. You're asking me like you weren't there, brov. Oh, here we going the abuse excuse? It's your man that put that shit up your nose, is it? I have to call your mother complain to your dad. How comes he never made me into a speed freak? Is Jensen special, or what? Go on, ain't this where you walk away again, brov and leave me feeling like shit? Go on, fuck off. Walk. Yeah, well at least I ain't running. Do what you want. Take what you want. Just don't pretend it's anyone else's fuck up except your own, all right. Yellow card, my black, gay ass. The ref's a Nazi! Where's your swastika arm band? What does a yellow card mean, anyway? Bit like a written warning. One more and he's out of the game. Fascist. Fascist. Sieg heil, sieg heil, sieg heil, sieg heil, seig heil, seig What? I am just trying to be fair. What about that big, old baby rhino that's stampeding around the pitch crippling his own team? Come to daddy, pretty boy. Ref! I've disallowed his goal. Ref! What! Oh. Come on, try that shit with me. Fitz. I better go. [VOMITS] Oh! Now, Danny, now! Oh, huh. Whoo! Woo, woo. Yeah. Not bad for a sissy, eh? [CLICKS] Ah, what the fuck? Now Marco, you know swearing doesn't suit you. Donna, you promised you wouldn't come near me again outside work. And I stuck to it. It's been like a week. Ten days. You swore on your mother's life, that's serious. Tell me about it, darling. Mum died last Tuesday. What? What of? Ah-huh. Donna, what did your mum die of? What is that bunny bully doing here? What are you doing here? Hi. Fuck off, fruitcake. Kingston, her mum died. Died? Last week, dropped dead, who knew? What did she die of? That's what I'm trying to find out. ARCHER: Marco man, ball. No mum, no deal. Can I take one of you together? ARCHER: Marco! What did your mum die of, Donna? Actually, that is a bit mysterious. What the fuck is wrong with you people? Ball! You prat. Well. The coroner's results were inconclusive. Apparently, the symptoms were identical to anaphylactic shock, but I made that dinner myself so I know for a fact there were no nuts in that chicken curry. Nuts? Yeah, she was allergic. Gosh, this really is a gay team, isn't it? Hello? We're gay, especially Marco. Oye. Marco's not allergic to nuts. He's obsessed with nuts. My nuts. He's not the only one. Come again? Oh, Kingston, you don't think I've come all this way just to see Marco, do you? I've totally grown out of fantasizing about me having sex with Marco. Thank God. Thank God. Fantasizing about you having sex with each other is so much hotter. BOTH: Donna! ARCHER: Marco! ALL: Yeah. MAN: Nice one. Aah, aah. This is our way, you bastard. As Adam, my man. Perfectly fair and square. So you know what? I bet your actual football feels all right, doesn't it? ARCHER: What in Christ's name is going on over here? Who the hell's this? Hello, I'm Donna. It's Marco's stalker. Is he on your team? Would you mind getting off the bleeding pitch? Actually, technically I'm not on the pitch. Would you please go and sit with the other spectators? Excuse me, ref. Are you the ref? Am I technically on the pitch? Is she pissed? Joey, mate! Are you all right, Archie? Sorry, miss, you are? Am I, technically, on the pitch? No. See, the ref says no. But you shouldn't stand there. You're not safe. Oh, you're sweet. Are you gay? Joey! Why don't you come and sit with me, love. All right then. So, where are your shorts then? Ooh. Let's go. How the fuck did she know we'd be here? She must have followed us. What? You reckon I told her? I ain't reckoning nothing. I'm just wondering. Kingston! Will one person's love ever be enough for you? Well, so now it's my fault? Everything's always about you, ain't it? Why not someone to blame? Kingston. K! Let's go. Let's go. K, you silly fucker. Oh, are they fighting over a bird? You can fuck off! And take your woman with you. Stud. Hey, a bit of girl trouble, player? I feel bad for you, son. ALL: I've got 99 problems and a bitch ain't one. [LAUGHING] Hey give her my number, all right, yeah. [LAUGHING] BOY: Daddy! Oh shit. Back me up, boys, what have you got for me, yeah? Watch goalie. Fuck off, psycho! [CLICKS] [WHISTLES TRILLS] [CHEERING] Oi, big daddy! Big man, your son's talking to you. He's just come down to see what you look like in case he forgets. Keep playing. Say hello to your daddy, Romeo. You probably don't recognize him but that's him. The one with no worries. The one with no ties. No responsibilities. The one with no balls. Did anyone here even know that Adam had kids? That's right, kids. I know you've forgotten, Adam, but there's more. Oh, yeah. Two more, two more mistakes. Two more slip ups to run away from and never pay for. What the fuck is all this bullshit? Who the fuck are all these women? Why don't we just play some football? Halftime. Are you having a laugh, mate? It's only been two minutes. 12 actually. It's 20 minutes each half. We booked it for an hour. Ah, you started late and you're bound, contractually, to finish on the hour. We can skip the break if you want, but I suggest you need the time to sort yourselves out. I'll sort you out. Fitz, he's right, mate. Leave it. Okay, Kat, so what exactly is it you think you're trying to do? Oh, I don't know, Adam. I really have got no clue. Why would I even bother when everything about you says waste of bloody time. Maybe I'm not supposed to do anything this time. Maybe it's your turn. Yeah, well I've done everything I wanna do with you. Well, what about our son? What exactly do you plan on doing with him besides ignoring him? What am I supposed to do? You could try saying hello. He's your son, for God's sake. And how do I know that? What? Listen, you seem like a good kid. I wish I could be sure you're mine. I wish I could wanna be in love with your mum and we could all live happily ever after, but where we are now is the real world where all there is is getting on with it. And you're gonna have to get on with it without me. So good luck in finding your real old man, yeah. Peace. Don't touch him. It's cool, mum. Let's go. You okay? Why wouldn't I be? Sorry, I couldn't keep quiet. Our lives, our business. You might be a lot of things, but you ain't a coward. You're not that. I wish I could kiss you now. Sorry, I can't help it. Try, mate, all right? Kat, hold up, yeah. What do you want, Jensen? Just a word with my little nephew. Is that cool? Hey, little man. Romeo. What's up, Romeo? I'm Jensen. I know, I've heard of you. You're the junkie. Who told you that? Everyone. Well, you ain't everyone, all right. I mean, believe your own eyes. Do I look like a junkie to you? You look a bit sick. Look, will you have a word with your mum for us, when you see her, like. Tell her, no matter how he acts, if she heard what he said to you about wishing he didn't want to love her, then she already knows he does love her. He just don't know how to yet. I mean, we know that, don't we? We heard him, right? I mean, what do you think? Should you go and just give up on your dad or stay and fight for him? We should stay. Well, whatever you say, Romeo. I mean, you're the man, ha-ha. All right, man of the match. I got you an isotonic drink. You're gonna have to go. What the fuck are you doing here anyway, you crazy bitch? You blokes can get off on lesbian sex, why can't I get off on a bit of bum boy action? We don't get off on lesbian sex. We can't handle the sight of one pussy, let alone two. Oh, you are so cute when you're angry. Sports drink? Fuck your sports drink. We're gay, you get me? It ain't worth a lick if it ain't got a dick. Gay, gay, gay. That's not what you said last week. You bitch. Or maybe you did. It's hard to catch every word someone says when they're face down with their head buried in your muff. Eh? You fucking bitch. Did you say muff? I do remember you asking me if you were doing it right. Did she say muff? You fucking treacherous, lying bitch. I remember the cute way you choked back a sob. Right, that's it. I'm sick of being nice. You are out of here. Kingston! You had sex with Donna? She promised she'd stay away. She promised she'd leave you alone. I did it for you. For me? You don't think I enjoyed it, do you? Ask him, did he come? Shut up. Go on, ask him. Did he come? Marco! Did you come? Well, sort of. But only a little bit. Ask him how many times? Shut up! Just shut up. Look, Marco, I was stupid. I was stupid and naive and desperate and she wore me down and she mugged me off. But every stupid thing I did was for the love of you. I love you. Simple as. Shouldn't that be straight up? [SIGHS] DONNA: Marco! You two sit there, yeah. I'll get you a drink or something. So, enjoying the beautiful game, babe. Oh my God. It's total non-stop drama-rama. Why do they keep taking the ball off you though? Shouldn't they let you score more goals and that? I'm defensive midfield, babe. I...I set 'em up. Right. So, your actually quite good, really then? Keep watching, babe. KANE: Oh my days, blood, fire, dude. I'm gonna have to charge you extra for this here. Shut the hell up and give it to me, yeah. Bro, geezer, what the fuck are all these lumps? What lumps? Ah! Oh, them lumps? Do it! [SCREAMS] Fuck sake, you two, there's women and children present. You got any charlie, man? Do. Are you not still sulking there are you, sweetheart? Come on, talk to your auntie Donna. Dear auntie Donna, my boyfriend just shagged some tart he doesn't even care about and now that tart slash so called friend thinks that I should have a sense of humor about it. Should I take out a contract or break her legs myself? Well, you know, there's one way to even out the score. This ain't a game, Donna! This is my life you're fucking up. We used to be friends. What happened to that? It was fine when it was even, Marco. When it was fair. You really think you're the one's been cheated when I loved you more? You think I just fancy you, don't you? Like everyone. No, I think that you think you love me as a lover, but I loved you as a friend. Who am I going to cry to when he gets bored of my perfectly groomed eyebrows? When I'm middle aged and fat and getting dumped by toy boys and my Botox goes up the spout? Who's gonna make me laugh about it? Who's gonna come and sit and watch me be a shit goal keeper and bitch and lech about the other players like we used to? Your boyfriends? That's in films, Donna. In real life it's about mates. You were supposed to be my mate for life. But now you're just another mug who thinks I'm cute. I thought you were better than that. I thought that I was better than that. But I'm just cute. So, what's it like? What? With a girl? It's all right. It's like driving an automatic when you're used to a gear stick. Are they squidgy? Squidgy? They look sort of soft. You must've hugged a girl and that. Like who? Like your mum. Suppose. I sort of remember her, but she weren't soft. None of them are, really. Women, men, they're all untrustworthy bitches. Stick to your right hand, mate. Was it your first time lad? No, I did all that when I was 17. I shagged everything that would let me. But in the end you settled for blokes, yeah? I settled for Marco. And that's it with girls, forever then. Excuse me. Where the fuck is this conversation going? You considering going on a bisexual tip or what? I don't know. I've never had sex. I've never even really thought about it 'til recently and I'm like practically 18. Is that weird? It's all weird, man. Okay. I did sort of enjoy sex with Donna. For real? It was fucking hot. The girl's a sweet fool, but I'm like, does this mean I'm straight now? But I'm gayer than ever. I mean, I see cute girls and I'm like, hmm, cute girls. But I see a cute guy and I'm like the chick from The Exorcist. In the end, I'm just gay. Of course you're gay, brov. I mean, it ain't just about whether you're a pearl diver or a pole dancer. It's about who you are. Well, what if I'm not? Max's whole plan was to adopt a gay teen and give him a safe space and role model and blah, blah, blah. Don't worry about it. What's he gonna do? Take you back to the shop and exchange you for a gay one? I think you're safe there whichever way you go. But this is a gay team though, yeah. We're gonna have to make you a reserve, ha-ha. Just go back to your mum, all right, yeah mate? I...I'll fetch your drinks in a second. Look, just piss off, will ya? What is your fucking problem? ALEX: Listen, I know what I heard. FITZ: Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down, yeah. ALEX: I told you something was dodgy. Women's intuition. Then Androukosopolis is gay. But he used to bully me at school. Him and his six brothers and that. I'm telling you, he proper hard. Well, now you know what makes him hard, innit, ha-ha. Well, them fuckers can play. Why the fuck would any of them wanna be on the gay team when they could be on a proper one like. It's obvious, ain't it? Cause they're gay. So they can be themselves. So they can wear what they want, do what they want. Be free, like. How come they be keeping it such a big secret then? 'Cause they're playing us. There. He's right. I'd keep it a secret if I was playing us. Wouldn't be much of a secret, mate. Would you shut up, you muppet and try and stay on topic? Am I the only one here who sees what a gift this is? How's a gay team a gift? You looking for a butcher boyfriend? You just said it yourselves. If they're keeping it a secret, it's because they don't want you to know about it, but now... We know. So, let 'em know you know and watch 'em fall apart. You mean call them names? Any means necessary. I can't do that, Alex. Oh, for God's sake, Danny. I'm not slag 'em off just for being gay. Would you stop being such a puff. Alex! It's just a bit of name calling, Danny. You can kiss and make up after you've won. You've got a career to work for. What about our new sportsmanship tactic? Fuck sportsmanship. Fuck sportsmanship. The score's two one against a bunch of batty boys with 12 minutes to go. We need the results. They ain't afraid of a bit of gay baiting for a laugh and they're actually gay. Yeah, exactly they can say them things. Well, you're practically gay, aren't you? If they can laugh getting their own back on the bullies, why can't you? They're the bullies now, babe. Bum bandits or not. When's it going to be your turn, sissy boy? What do you think, skipper? Adam, Ad! What? Yeah, I don't know, mate. Alexandria's probably right. Danny knows I'm right. Don't you, babes? I suppose. [WHISTLE TRILLS] So the new tactic's queer bashing then? But words only and don't get caught. Since when do you start playing happy families? I'm just trying to do the right thing, brother. How's it feel to be the black sheep of the family for once? Wait, what have I missed? New tac... New tactics, my man. ALEX: When's it gonna be your turn, sissy boy? [LAUGHS MISCHIEVOUSLY] When's it going to be your turn? When's it going to be your turn? When's it going to be your turn? When's it going to be your turn? When's it going to be your turn? Sissy boy. Sissy boy. Sissy boy. Sissy boy. Sissy boy. For us, babes, yeah. [WHISTLES TRILLS] Wanna play, pretty boy? Wanna dance, sweetie? Y-M-C-A. Careful, Duckie, it's bad luck to kill a fairy. Oh. Now who's fucked? Your boyfriend last night. [CHEERING] Uhh. Uhh. Ooh-uhh. Oh, no. I'm back, now, I'm back, ha-ha. Nice one, brov. What the fuck was that? They know, mate. Know? Come on, you bastards! Say, princess, have you always walked like a girl? Piss off! Or is it the butty sex that makes you move so. Fuck off! ADAM: Fitz! FITZ: Ooh, help, help me. ARCHER: What you doing? Fuck this, I'm out. That's a red card, I'd say, ref. Or should that be, what's it? BOTH: Fuchsia. All right, what is going on? We're just being friendly, ref. Is it our fault if we're a little bit camp? My man here's right. They're just homophobic. Hey, what's wrong with a bunch of faggots playing footie? You need to send them all off here. Yeah, big, butch bullies. Yellow card. Yellow card! Free kick to Reapers. Yay, yay. ALL: Up the Platoon. You all right? I'm fine. Watch yourself, yeah. See, they're normie. What are you yammering about now? They're bloody sussed us. So? So, they know they're getting hammered by a fucking gay team. [CHEERING] They're out for blood. MAX: So? So? So what? You're gay, be gay. Use the force, sisters. The force? The gay force. Michaelangelo, Shakespeare, Leonardo DaVinci, Greta Garbo, Janis Joplin, Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar, Hannibal, Nureyev, Navratilova, Angela Davis, Miles Davis, George Michael, Freddie Mercury and Elton bloody John! And Justin Fashanu. You kids come from a long line of kings, queens and fierce divas. Now, fix up and take back the bloody game! It's on! Ah woo, ah woo, ah woo! ALL: Ah woo, ah woo, ah woo!
