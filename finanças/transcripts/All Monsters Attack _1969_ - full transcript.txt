NARRATOR: There are one hundred billion fixed stars in galactic space. There are also three billion nebula in macrocosm. And each one is as big as galactic space. Old stars explode and scatter as gas, and new stars are formed from the gas. What secrets are hidden in these countless stars? A star is in trouble. [MUSIC PLAYING] NARRATOR: All astronomical observatories catch waves. Irregular waves that might have been sent from outer space. [MUSIC PLAYING] [STATIC AND WHISTLES FROM TRANSMITTER] -Gentlemen, the waves have stopped, but we don't know yes if they are messages from outer space. Any questions? -Dr. Shiga, the same electric waves were picked up in England. Were they the same impulses, do you think, in your opinion? -Ah, yes. Those electric waves, in my opinion, are much different than the ones we are now getting. They came from beyond our galaxy. These impulses are much nearer. -Could these be humans-- do you suppose-- now living on this planet? -It's too early to really be certain. Will you start this? The moon lacks sufficient moisture and air. Therefore, it is impossible to sustain any life form on the moon as you know it. On Mars right there, there are no rivers at all. It's arid. And now, Venus-- it has a temperature of several hundred degrees centigrade. We come now to Jupiter. Frozen ammonia covers it entirely-- not breathable to us. Saturn-- the same, also no air. The conclusion-- no advanced vertebrates exist there. -If that's so, what is the meaning of the waves, would you say? -Well let's see. Let's assume that they came to us from Proxima Centauri, the star closest to Earth. As you know, we have today the spaceship we call the Apollo. And if we were to go to Centauri, do you know how long it would take us? [SEVERAL RESPONSES FROM CROWD] -One million years. So you see what it means. Yes. Even though we received an invitation from space man. Unless-- unless they pay us a visit, I'm afraid we'll never be able to get together. [LAUGHTER] -Are there men in space, truly? -Sure there are. Or Otherwise, those waves from space wouldn't have come. -Tom! Tom! Come here quick. I see something funny. -Yeah? -Yeah? -Look. -What is it? Can you tell? -Hmm. I know what it is. It's a space ship. -Yeah? It's true. That's keen. -Now me. Let me look. I want to see. -You're too young. I've got to watch. GIRL: Let me look! -All right. -I'm sure it's a space ship. -Yeah. -I can't see anything. -It came down in the woods across the river. Akio, let's go find it. -OK, let's go. -Wait! Take me too. AKIO: I bet it's in the vacant lot where we play. -Mm-hmm. MOTHER: Akio? Akio? -Ah, it's too late, I guess. Mother will scold us again. -Yeah, it's too late. -Well, well, I thought you'd all be studying. I suppose that you've been stargazing. AKIO: Yes. But honestly, we saw a space ship. -But you must have imagined it. It isn't good for children to stay up late. Your mother wouldn't approve either. You must admit it, Tom. -But you see, the reason we watch the stars every night is that-- -Of course, I know the reason. You want to discover new stars, isn't that it? Akio wants to name a star after him, and you, Tom, want a star named after you. -That's not the only reason. See what it says? Signals coming from out of the stars constantly. So if we're receiving signals systematically, it could mean there are space creatures. -We're trying to discover the star that's sending the signal. -So that's the reason we all stay up. It could be they are quite intelligent. Just think-- no more wars on their planet and no more traffic accidents. -Just some more of your imagination. There is no such star. Now behave, or I'll take away your telescope. -Gee, grown ups spoil a dream. -Hm. -All right, no more foolishness. Go to bed now. -All right. -At dawn? [DOOR OPENS] -OK. [DOOR SHUTS] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MAN GRUNTING] -Stop. Stop. -What is it? A space man? -Idiot. It's worse than a space man. [MAN CONTINUES GRUNTING] [SIGHS] -I'll attend to it. -OK. -Oh well, so there it is, huh? Hey! Hold on! Just a second. Hold it! Hold it! What's this? -A dart. KONDO: You come back, too. Hmm? -Good day, Kondo. -Idiot. Don't say Kondo. Say good day, officer. -It's all right, young lady. My name is Kondo. But see here, two of you kids shouldn't ride on one bike. -I'm sorry, but I'm in a hurry. -You're in a hurry? This time of day? Ah-ha. It means you kids are up to mischief. I understand. -No, we aren't. We're out here looking for a space ship. -Huh. You are? -Mm-hmm. -Oh, you're joking. -No, we saw the ship land here. -It's true. It came down last night. -I see. I see. I see. Yes, but if you're naughty, you know what I'm going to do with you two mischief makers? I'm going to shave your heads. -Yee! -Yes, it's true. Here, don't forget this. Go ahead. But don't ride there. -All right. -Walk. -I think it's beyond this hill. -Let's climb from here. -Wait for me, Akio. -Hurry. [GASPING] -It's space men. [SIGHS OF RELIEF] -A little hair is all it is. GIRL: Oh, I want it. Let's catch it. -Come on, you idiot. He's much too quick. You can't. All right, let's go. -Yeah. [GASPS] -Akio! Brother! -What is it? [GASPS] -The ship, it is there. We were right. -Yeah, come on. -It's great. -Are there space men on it? -There could be inside. Akio, let's go in. -Sure. -No, I'm scared. I don't want to go in. -Scaredy cat. The space men won't hurt you. If they flew here, they're civilized. You're dumb. -Yo, anyone there? -Hello? -You're the idiots. You think the space men will understand what you say? Really? Are you kidding? -They'll understand. -I guess the crew's out. -It looks like it, all right. -This is great. Hey, it's running. Imagine travelling on this thing. Great, huh? It would be keen. Ready standby for immediate countdown. Crew, ready for lift-off. -OK. [GASPS] -Ready for countdown. -Countdown beginning. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, zero. -Akio! Brother! Akio? Brother! -Hey, it's moving. -Yeah, it is. -Stop it, then. -Akio, you get out of there. Or else later on, you'll get a scolding. You're gonna get a good scolding and not gonna eat dinner at all. -Stop it. Can't it be controlled? -It won't stop now, I guess, until the fuel runs out. -You operated the controls, though, didn't you? -Of course, I did. But don't forget, you ordered me to. Look there. -We're in space already. Funny, there's no weightlessness in here. -This ship's out of the ordinary, isn't it? -Mm-hmm. Hey, look up there. Oh, they're on our course. -A meteor! We'll be hit. -It's terrible. It's heading right for us. Change our course. -Tom, I can't. The controls aren't right. -We're gonna be hit then. -It's Gamera. Good for you, Gamera. -Help us, Gamera. -Nice going. -Thanks a heap. -Gamera, thanks a lot. -Gamera's racing us. Who do you think will win? -I'm not scared now. We're in good hands. -Yeah. Gamera's always been the children's friend. -Mm-hmm. He's really speeding up. Mach 3, I think. -No, it's kind of deceptive out there. See Gamera's great jets? Mach 33 is what I would say. -Really? I didn't realize it. -At mach 60, he'd leave the solar system, I bet you. -Let's go, Gamera. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Gamera, what happened? -Gamera! Gamera! Gamera, what's the matter? Gamera! You know what I think? Maybe he's trying to stop us. -I don't think he's coming with us. -Why? -Look at that speedometer. The lights are going faster. -Then our speed's increasing, isn't it? -It's remote control. -Akio, Gamera's jet propulsion. -Gamera! Keep at it. -Gamera! Akio, what do we do? -I don't know, because the ship's going faster every second. -Gamera! Gamera? -Can't you hear us? -Mother! Oh, Mother! -My, my, such a loud voice, and where were you, young lady? -It's awful. -Has Akio teased you again? -No, you don't understand. They went away on a space ship. -Nonsense, Tomoko. You are just as silly as they are. -Oh, it is true. Because we found the ship, all right. And then they decided to go in it, and it lit up. -It's plain to see. Your brother, Akio, is up to something. -Mother, tell me. Don't you believe in space ships or in space creatures at all? -No, I don't. -But the paper said they do. Lots of people, they said, believe in flying saucers. -Made-up stories. -But they were right. -I said that's all. Now, I want you to be good and study. Or you won't get into a good school. -I'm in trouble. How can I make her understand? Poor boys. I wonder where they are now. [WIND HOWLING] -Tom, Tom! Wake up. We've landed. -Akio, we're really safe then? Are you all right? -I'm OK. -Look there. The hatch is clear. -The air here is like ours, so we don't need any space suits. -Are we back on earth? Do you think? -Maybe. Let's go out and look. -Akio, we're not on Earth. -That's obvious, I'd say. -It's Mars or Venus. -No, they don't have any air. So I guess this is a distant star. -Thank goodness is has air. -You know, there are stars in the galaxy just like Earth. So I suppose we found ourselves a new star-- the first ones on it. -Wait a minute. Don't forget we were brought here b by remote control. Let's be careful. [EXPLOSION] -Ah, it was Gyaos. -Well the monster looks like Gyaos. Still, he's a different color. -An out-of-galaxy Gyaos. -We're cornered. -You said it. -Look there. -Hey, the water's running backwards. You see that? [SCREECHES] [SCREECHES] [ROARS] -I think he's going to return to his home. -Where'd this come from? Uh oh-- hurry, the opposite switch! -Jump off. -Oh, see? The water's returning. -What's going on? -I don't know. But from what I've seen, I'll bet we're on a highly civilized star. -Moving instantly, that's great. -Yes. What do you say we investigate some more? -Yeah, let's. -Hey, it's great. [VOICES ECHOING] -Did you hear that sound? -Somebody's here, I bet. Call. -Hello? Answer! Are you there? Is anyone here? -Idiot. They don't understand our language. That's the reason they don't answer. -Akio, what if goblins come out? Then what do we do? -Don't you worry. -Akio, Akio! This is scary! -Jump down then. What are you afraid of? -Did you see? It's a moving corridor. -Oh, yeah? Let's get on. -OK. [SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE] -It's wonderful. This must be the control center. -Hmm. -Hello? Where are we now? Can't you tell us your identity? [SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE] -You see? I explained they'd understand the language. -Greetings. We waited for you. -Then you do understand our Earth language. -Of course. This ultra-speaking machine translates telepathically all languages. -Oh, boy! Science has advanced here much more than on Earth. -Mm-hmm. Miss, can you tell me which star this is? -And can you tell us the distance to the Earth? -The star we are on, we call Terra. And the star is exactly like the Earth and has the same atmosphere. Our star is situated exactly on the other side of the sun from your Earth. -I understand. Terra and the Earth are twin planets, then. -Why didn't we know it was there? -You see? It's simple. The Earth and Terra are on a line, but with the sun always staying between us, you can't see them. -Akio, it's a great discovery. -Mmm. The Earth and Venus, Jupiter. Then there's Uranus, Saturn, and then Mercury, Mars, Pluto, and Neptune. That makes nine planets, and Terra is the tenth. -You're right. [MONSTER ROARS] -It's Gyaos again. -Barbella, it's a nuisance. Open the pit. -Yes. -Young lady, excuse me. Barbella's your name? -Yes. Its translation is "sweet as a little bird." -And my name is Florbella. It means "pretty as a flower." -Where are the other people here? -Ah, Akio, see the water again? It's running backwards like before. It's against the law of gravity. -We control the laws of nature here through our science. -Oh. You're quite superior, because I looked in my telescope every single night. You see, I was searching for a planet like this. I knew somewhere, there should be a star-- highly intelligent, that had no wars or accidents. [MONSTER ROARS] -It's that monster again. -This is our watchdog. He's called Guiron, and we can control his actions. Don't worry. -Gyaos is running. -I don't understand. Why do you have such monsters anyway? You're so advanced, and all. -You are right. Ours was truly an advanced society. We got to the point where we control the laws of nature by advanced electronics. But then, a mixed up computer brought calamity. We found, to our regret, that it made uncontrollable monsters as well. -[BOTH] Gee. -We attempted to send out some signals, thinking someone would hear us. There was no answer, though. -Oh, gosh. You see? Those were the waves reported by our Dr. Shiga. -You see, those who were still alive got on a big space ship, hoping to fine another star. But it failed. Now, just two of us are left alone. Then we heard a call. Someone was on a small ship we sent out to probe the area. And that's how you two were brought here. -I see. -We've since been confined to the base here. We can't go out. -Observe out there. It's getting colder and colder, completely bound in by glaciers in just five hours. -Barbella. What you are looking at now used to be a great city. That was long ago. It's the home of monsters now. -Well then, can't we go back to Earth at once? You'll be welcome there. -Thank you. We'll have the flying saucer checked, so we can make the trip before we're blocked in. -Aren't we lucky? -Mm. -Gee, if Gamera were only here now. -Don't worry. I'm sure Gamera's looking for us. -Gamera? [MUSIC PLAYING] [ROARS] -This is the lounge. It's just above the control center. Now, you rest here until we can repair the ship. -[BOTH] Thanks. -This ship only holds two, you know. So what are we going to do with-- -I realize that. There's time to make adjustments. I'll run tests. I'll check with our scanner to see if the boys are poisonous. If not, the boys will become our rations. You make the final check on the ship. -I'm hungry. -You think we're really gonna go home? -Don't worry. The girls said we'd go home just as soon as the space ship is repaired. -Yeah, and just think how excited they'll get on earth, how groovy the girls are. They'll be a big hit down there. Right, Akio? Akio, what is it? Hmm. That's strange. -Now boy, listen. You are to answer all questions that are asked you. AKIO (VOICEOVER): Yes. -Pay attention. Let your mind imagine what it would most like now. Think. Try to concentrate. Are you thinking? What's the matter? Go on. Complete the thought. I see. Right away. Now, will you answer my questions until the food is ready? AKIO (VOICEOVER): Yes. -Are you in pain? AKIO (VOICEOVER): No. It feels nice. -I see. What? -Akio. What is it, Akio? Akio, what's the matter? Akio. Akio. Answer me, Akio. FLORBELLA: This is a nuisance. All right. Now, concentrate again. You know Gyaos. Are there many monsters on Earth? AKIO (VOICEOVER): Not now. Gamera got them all. -Gamera? Is that a creature? This creature's looking for you, you said. Think. Remember it. Try. AKIO (VOICEOVER): Gamera's the friend of children. FLORBELLA: The friend of children? AKIO (VOICEOVER): Yes. He appears when we need him. He saved a child in Hokkaido once. He knocked Gyaos out when Gyaos tried to eat the child. He saved two boys, too, when Viras attacked the Earth. -You know? That's strange. I'm sure I remember you stopped moving. -I had a feeling I at a lot of Mother's donuts. -Your Mother sure makes donuts real great. I'm starving-- just the thought of it. -I'm now hungry, just thirsty. -The space ship? -All checked. We can leave whenever you're ready. -Good, at last. Here. Prepare all the foods you see on these cards. Use sleeping powder. -Sleeping? -Right. And when they're unconscious, under the effects of our powder, we'll gobble their brains raw. -Eat their brains? -All the knowledge that has been handed down is stored now in their complicated brain cells. And so if we eat their brains, that knowledge will help us to adapt. We can accomplish it, just as our bacteria do here, to become higher animals. -I understand. -Yes. -Hello, my dear. I just came for my son. [CAR DOOR OPENS] -Elsa! How nice. [CAR DOOR SHUTS] -Thank you for keeping Tom. -No trouble at all. However, Tom and Akio are still not back. I don't understand it at all. -Oh? Where did they go? I wonder if Tomoko knows where they went. -Else, there's no use asking my daughter anything. I'm sure the boys have told her not to tell. She says they're lost in space. -In space? -Yes. Tom wants to stay with us longer. He must have run away, knowing you were coming. [LAUGHTER] -I'm sure he did. -Well, Tom can stay with us a few days more. -You're very kind. Thank you. I'm much obliged. I'll see you later. -As long as you're here, can't you stay for tea? -I'd like to, but I can't today. Thank you. -I understand. -Thank you, again, for your trouble. -Take care. -Oh, Auntie. -Why, Tomoko. -They are lost in space. It's true. Akio and your Tom did go. -What really happened? Can you take us there? -Mm-hmm. Kondo! Kondo, it's awful! Hurry, hurry! -What's the matter? KONDO: Well, they left their bikes here. TOMOKO: Here. This is where the space ship was. -Tomoko, the other day, there was an announcement by the aerospace bureau, and I'm going to repeat exactly what they said. The flying saucer scare was simply an illusion or made-up story. TOMOKO: No, it's true. It is. I saw it with my own eyes. -Darling, listen. The Apollo crew said there are no living things out there at all. That our Earth is the only oasis there is. There are no living things elsewhere. There are no living things in space. -But the boys really did get on a saucer. And when they did, it took off. -No, dear. -Don't you think that is the truth? -Of course. I know it. You never lie. You're a little lady, a good girl. Yes, don't cry. I'll find Akio and Tom. Hm? -I know you can. -Happier now, huh? [SIGHS] -I give up, I guess. -The observatory, we'll check. -Thanks, Kon. Good idea. -Kon, surely you don't take her seriously. The observatory can't be brought into this now. -She said she saw-- -She's just a young child. And I'm convinced she just imagined she saw it. The boys are around here somewhere. I just know that they are. Please, you've got to look for them right now. -Ah, sure. I will. Yes, yes-- -Thank you. -Yes. -Because psychologists insist that if you believe everything a child says, it's educationally and psychologically wrong. -It's easy to say. Tomoko there, she doesn't like. -You mustn't listen. TOMOKO: Brother, Kon's going to find you, so don't give up. Please, dear God, look after the boys, and save them. -Akio. -Mm-hmm. -Well, isn't this appealing, yes? You are hungry, aren't you? -[BOTH] Oh, yes. -Tom, look. Our favorite donuts. -Sure looks great. -I'll say. Looks just like the ones Mother makes, doesn't it? -Please eat, won't you? -Thanks, Barbella. -Just a minute. -What is it? -Be quiet. -Akio? -I thought I heard Gamera coming. -Oh? I don't hear anything at all. -I must have imagined it. TOM: Let's eat. Come on. -I'll give you half. -Thank you. -Mmm, it's good. Hey, Akio. Akio, what is it? What's the matter? -The sleeping powder took effect. Go on, hurry. -Right. -Cut here. Remove the skull in this area. [ALARM SOUNDS] -It's Gamera. -Gamera is the children's friend. It's here for them, Florbella. -It's bad timing. -Let's take care of it. Gamera can't beat Guiron. I'll try the missile first. -I didn't do any good. Let Guiron out. -He's dead. Serves him right. [BOTH LAUGH] [SLEEPILY GRUNTS] [GASPS] -Akio. Akio! What's happened? Oh, lady! Oh, lady! -We must cook them. Or-- wait a minute. There's no response. That's strange. Gamera must have put it out of order. It's the only one left. If it's no good, then-- -You're right. We'll eat their brains after we fix the ship. Let's attend to it. -It's awful. Akio. Akio. Akio! -It hurts. [GASPS] -What happened to my hair? -There's no time to worry about that. I just found out. These people are cannibals. -Huh? -They're not fixing the ship just to take us back to Earth. That want to go back there to eat people. Let's run. -But my head. -Here, wear this. Hurry! Hurry! AKIO: Tom, wait a minute. -How did they get out? -They know, I guess. And so they're attempting to run away. -I'll soon stop that. -Ah, thought you'd get away, eh? -We're right back to the starting cage. Run! -Akio, you're smart. -I reset the carriers. [LAUGHS] Come and look. See there? -Hip hooray! The cannibals are gone. -Quick! Let's go break the handles, so they can't operate it. -OK. -All set. -Good. Victory! They'll not return here again. There, it's done. Well, I think that'll hold them, all right. Say goodbye forever. -Not quite. -We broke the controls. -But you couldn't return. -But we adjusted the control, and set it for a round trip. -OK, let's go. -Stay where you are. -Let me go! We're not good to eat. -Get up there. Hands above your head. Back to back. -Contact. [MUFFLED PROTESTS FROM CHILDREN] -Hurry, go repair the space ship. -Where could they have gone? Even the police are worried about it. -Well, I'll certainly give Tom a good licking, all right. That is, when he finally gets back. -I'm so very sorry. -It's not your fault. -I hope they return. [CAR HONKS] - There they are. There's the little girl. -Tomoko, will you tell us about the spaceship you saw? Will you? -Wait a second. Just who are you? -Are you Akio's mother? We have recently learned that a space ship was seen in these parts. -Policemen reported the missing boys. So we came here to check on the spaceship theory. -Oh, no. Else? -Is it true, then? -Tomoko, tell us your story, all right? -Oh sir, do they know where the ship went? Its destination? -We don't know. The ship, so they say, flew very rapidly. We only know about the mysterious waves that have been received. Come, tell us the story. What did it look like? Tomoko, tell us-- [SEVERAL QUESTIONS AT ONCE] -What do we do, Akio? Can't we get out? I miss Mama. -Have courage, Tom. We have to look for a way to escape. -I wish Gamera would come and help us out. He should be right here now. -I can't hear. Let's try and call. -Gamera. Gamera! Gamera! Gamera! -Ah ha! Good idea. Say, do you still have your dart pistol? -Oh, yeah. Good. -That switch, hit it. -Hold on. OK. I didn't hit it. -You aimed a little high. Tell me, how many shots to go? -I still got three more. Trust me. -Hey, that's peculiar. See that? It's Guiron's remote control contact you hit. The same contact, try it again. -OK. -You closed it all, Akio. -There, fixed at last. [GUIRON ROARS] -It's Guiron. What happened? -What do we do? We can't control it from here. Hurry. Let's escape to Earth. -Barbella, what about these boys? -Leave them. Lots of others on Earth. Quick, quick! -We'll never be able to get to Earth. -Please wait. -What is it? [GRUNTS] -It hurts. I can't move. Help me. Florbella! -You know the rules of our planet. Those who are useless have to go. It's the only solution. -Guiron-- he's getting closer, see? We'll both be killed. It's the end! Help, help, help us, someone! Help! Help us! -Let us out! -Let us out! -Gamera! Gamera, help us. Get us out. You can make it. -Don't give up, Gamera. -Gamera, hang on. -Get going, Gamera. -Gamera! -Gamera, don't give up. We need you, Gamera! -Help us. -Gamera, don't die now. -Gamera. Gamera! Can't you hear us? -You all right, Tom? -I'm OK. -Gamera! -Gamera! -Gamera! Get him, and get him good. -You can kill it, Gamera. -He jumped in the air. -Nice jumping there, a success. -Gamera, get away. Get going quick, because he's going to attack. -Brilliant. You got him down. -Stay in there. [BOTH GASP] -Nice. Real good going. -A go-go dancer-- Gamera's doing a dance. -No, he's not doing a dance. He's trying to get those metal things out. Unless the metal's out, his legs won't retract. -Then he can't use his jets at all. -See that? Now, Guiron's heading for us. Quick, hurry! The control, which is it? -I don't know. Never mind. Push them all. Hurry! -We've accomplished something, but we're not out yet. -This must be the end. Even Gamera can't help us. -I get so angry. I don't like to give up. I wish we had a weapon of some kind. -I know. Still, wishing can't do any good. -Let's look around. -I don't understand. Gamera isn't dead. Now, we'll see. It's a last resort, but I'll get him. -Ow! Ow! [GROANS] -Huh? Look, what's that? -I wonder if it could be the weapon I wanted. -Akio, a missile! -Yes. The switch. -Go ahead. -Look here. Gamera's getting out. -Oh! -Hurray! Nice going, Gamera. -Good for you, Gamera. That's the way to do it. Hurray for Gamera! -Yay Gamera! -That'll hold him, Gamera. -Hurray, Gamera! -The missile. This is it. -OK. [FLORBELLA GROANS] -Gamera! The hole, you must try and get it. -Throw it at him. -[BOTH] Hip hurray! -Tom, I think Gamera's calling us. -Uh-huh. -Look. Gamera's repairing the space ship. Let's go. He's waiting for us. -Yeah. -What a big hand! -I'll say. Awfully big. -Let's go. -Mm. -Hey, look at us. -Hip hurray! -We're going to Earth, at last. -We're in luck. -Listen! Listen! -What's the matter? What's going on? -No-- Gamera. He's coming. I'll report it. Oh, I made a mistake. [PHONE RINGS] -Yes? Yes, this is he. I don't believe it. It's utterly ridiculous. -Doctor, I see Gamera on my telescope. -What's that? -The space ship's in his mouth. [INTERPOSING VOICES] -It's hard to realize. -But-- but it's true. Yes, it is. The boys were taken from here. -I hope she's right. -Yes, I am so. -I hope what you are saying is true. [LAUGHTER] -Cut it out. It's not right to tease her. You know, Gamera is a friend to children, yes? Yes. -Oh, Kon. -Eh? Yes, dear? -Thank you. -It's quite all right. [INTERPOSING VOICES] -Where's the place? -Beyond the mountain. -Thank you. -Excuse me, are you their mothers? -Yes. -And I, also. -I am Dr. Shiga. I'm very surprised. Gamera was seen headed this way with a space ship in his mouth. -And our children? TOMOKO: Look! There's Gamera! -Yes, you're right. -Don't go down there. -Tomoko! -Akio! Tom! Are you all right? We were worried. -We should have believed her. There are times, I guess, when our children are telling the truth, aren't there? -Yes, you're right. TOMOKO: Akio! Tom! -Tomoko. -Are you all right? We were worried. -We're OK. -Ahh. -Your glasses. -Oh, it's all right. My glasses keep slipping when I get excited. [LAUGHTER] -Thanks! -We're back. Mother! -Akio! -Tom! Are you all right? -I'm glad you're home. Still and all, you made everybody worry over you. -You're right. Everybody, Mother, I'm sorry. -Oh, I see. Are you showing us your penitence? Is that the idea? -They did it on the star. They cut his hair. -Space creatures did it? -Kon? -Huh? -Listen, Kon. There are space people like you, too. -Oh. [TOMOKO GIGGLES] -Akio, Tom. -Ah, Dr. Shiga, we discovered a new planet and saw space people. -Yes. We thought there'd be a highly civilized and peaceful planet, where there were no wars or accidents. But we found out Earth's the best and that we should work to make it better. We shouldn't long for other stars. Just try love instead. Stop wars and no more accidents. I guess that's all I can ask. -You're right, yes. And your explanation does you honor. -Thanks. -Gamera's pulling in his head. Is he going? -So long, Gamera! -Thank you, Gamera! -Goodbye, Gamera! -Goodbye, Gamera! -Goodbye! -So long, Gamera! -Thanks, Gamera. -Goodbye, Gamera! -Goodbye! -So long! Goodbye. -Goodbye, Gamera. We'll never forget you.
