Please take a seat. Mr Santos and Miss Chan will be here in a bit, please take a seat everyone. - Thank you. - Where's the bathroom? Right side of the corridor, male bathroom is right down by the stairs we came from. Thank you. Officer Cheung. Miss Chan. We've been in touch over the phone many times, nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, too. Where's Lok Ying-choi? He just went to the bathroom. Officer Ma. - No need to guide me there - Thank you. Alright, that'll be all. I'll show you the way. I know where to go. My apologies... I've just been having a chat with a friend, that's why I'm late. How are you all? Hello... I'm Cheung Ka-yan. Pleasure to meet you. And to you. Nice to meet you. I'm Jack Santos, I asked you all over today to gain some clarity over some details regarding the case of the recently discovered body of Wu Ying-yung, because I've researched it before. Don't worry, it's nothing much, just a small talk. - Mollie, you can start. - Okay. Well, our files show that on the 10th of March in 2021, we discovered a body at Number 146 of Tong Fat Street, Cheung Sha Wan, which is at the bottom of the stairs of a basement. Can you give us the lowdown from this point onwards? Sure, on the 10th of March in 2021, we discovered a human corpse. After having a forensics check, verifying it as a male body, deceased for eight years. Time of death around late 2012 or early 2013. The most important clue we uncovered when finding these remains was that in 2021 a restaurant called Lun Yuen Restaurant planned to build a connecting part between two connected shops. - What is it? - Human remains! What are the renovation crew doing? They said that they'd dig a hole through the channel here. Based on witness accounts and missing persons reports, Towards the end of 2012, there was a missing tenant by the name of Wu Ying-yung. Within a month of his disappearance, his wife, Yan Fung-ping, broke the lease in his place. At the time of this particular case, Yan Fung-ping had passed away three years ago. Later on we tracked down their son, Wu Tsun Tung. The forensics expert suggested at the time, that we take both DNA samples of Wu Tsun-tung and the human remains for scientific examination to verify the source of the remains. Finally confirmed the source of the remains, it was the husband of Yan Fung-ping, who went by the name of Wu Ying-yung. Okay. So you connected the missing person to the case of Wu Ying-yung, then tracked down his son. The wife had already passed away at the time of the incident. After the disappearance of the deceased the wife then moved in with a man by the name of Chan Wing-chiu. This is Chan Wing-chiu. You suspect adultery came into play? Yes. Because just a month after the disappearance of Wu Ying-yung, Yan Fung-ping broke the lease. And started living with a man who lived in the same apartment but in a different room who named Chan Wing-chiu. Did you know Wu Ying-yung? Nope. You slept with his wife, and you say you don't know him? His wife and I got to know each other only after he'd gone missing. According to our information, they brought Wu Tsun Tung to live in Shenzhen for two years. Because Wu Tsun Tung started high school in 2015, they moved back to Hong Kong for the sake of the children. The motive for killing is obvious. But Yan Fung-ping had already passed away. On 20th October 2017, Yan Fung-ping died of leukemia at Queen Elizabeth Hospital. We couldn't ask her any questions and had no way of knowing any motive she might have had. But that is strange. According to our information, half a year or so before Wu Ying-yung went missing. The other two tenants in this unit, both moved out. We tracked them down and interrogated them. You really don't recognize the deceased Wu Ying-yung? Of course not, why would I recognize him? He's a gangster, probably a bad guy, his body is full of tattoos. He is always beating his own wife and child, an all-around terrifying guy. What about you? Well, he was very vicious talking about violence and killing all day long, and foulmouthed too. We never crossed paths. Never? What about you? Did you go visit your wife often? I'd rarely go to their place to meet her. We'd usually meet up elsewhere or I'd invite them over. So I didn't know that Scar Yung you were talking about. As for the tenants, there was another woman called Fung Yim. Did you recognize the deceased Wu Ying-yung? Not at all. According to the landlord's lease records, the person who rented this unit was called Cheung Chi Man, but that's neither of you. I'm his cousin. Why use his name to rent this space? For what reason? Did you live there? No particular reason, and we didn't live there. You had a unit at Tai Kok Tsui, why rent another unit for your wife? I didn't... Officer, I only lived there because I had no other options. Please continue. I used to work at an accounting firm. But owing to a moment of greed, I stole a million dollars from the company intending to borrow it for a bout of gambling in Macau. Not expecting to lose everything. Returned terrified, not knowing what to do and needed some place to hide where no one could find me. Not knowing how I would replace the funds I'd stolen. It turns out there was pointless to keep running, so I turned myself in and was sentenced to a year and a half in prison. Good thing you came clean, we knew about your criminal record beforehand. But I want to question you again, you really weren't acquainted with Wu Ying-yung? Officer, I'm telling you, I was not acquainted with that Scar Yung whatsoever. I didn't know him and other peoples' matters aren't my concern as well. They didn't want to admit and claimed that they have nothing to do with the case. Afterwards, we found a male tenant who still lives there, by the name of Ho Cheuk Man. Please continue. He's a gangster, nicknamed Scar Yung, because he had a knife scar on his face. He was despicable, sordid, fierce and evil. Who lived with his wife and kid in one of the rooms, he is always beating his wife, what a vicious man. Disobedient idiot! What're you looking at? I'll beat you too! Can't I even look? Who do you think you are? No need to be so vicious, okay? After many inquiries, we couldn't secure any definitive evidence. And so, we classified the case as corpse discovering and marked the cause of death as unknown. We found a hole caused by the blunt force of hard object in the skull, but did it show evidence of death? Or was it delivered and caused after the victim's death? We really couldn't say. But in the medical report, it was stated that the hole was caused by the impact of a sharp and hard object. Because eight years have passed by now, It's difficult to deduce whether it was the cause of death. Understood. Since the day you were investigating up to this point, everything seemed to be over now. The decision to reopen this investigation was the result of the appearance of an individual by the name of Lok Ying-choi. And that is you, right? I want to ask you, why choose to reopen this investigation? Well, yes. I was transferred from the Anti-Drug Squad. After receiving this case, I felt there were some aspects of it worth further investigation. Frankly, this was the only task I had at the time, so I put all my effort into it. Playing Suona Horn? Yes. But now it's just records, There is no live bands now, so I have no work as well. No work? So what do you do now? Just a bit of temporary work. I'm telling you, there's lots of rules in funeral homes. Not everyone can handle it, you got to find someone professional. That's why there are other temporary jobs I could do. However, after spell of illness, I worked fewer temporary jobs now. So I could do a part-time job occasionally. You are sick, don't work too hard. Why not take some rest? You're right. But I've got no money, brother. Oh, right. That guy's wife is very pretty, is she going to have an affair with the neighbour? No, I don't think so. What about the disfigured face kid? Not just disfigured face, he limps while he walks. If she is in search of a man, I'm available. No way! No, I don't think so. However, that Scar Yung was a savage sort who performing awful deeds all day. What kind of awful deeds? He was such a man who even peeping others in the shower, was this what led to his murder? Peeping on people in shower leads to getting severely beaten at worst, not straight up to murder, right? The biggest suspect in all of this is Chan Wing-chiu. Fooled around with someone's wife, that's a dultery and murder for him. Madam Yan did a good job in pursuing this clue. But there's just some things I want to check on again, no particular reason. After following up on the case, I found more holes in it. What exactly? I have a theory. In such a small room that is parted by wood boards, ceilings are all connected by vents. That Wu Ying-yung always beating his wife, causing chaos and noise. But all neighbours are saying that they don't recognize them, that doesn't make any sense. The most important thing is those neighbours all denied knowing anything which arouses my suspicion the most. You claim to not know Chatty Yung, but you should've seen him before. Chatty Yung? Was he not called Scar Yung? Nope, not Scar Yung, he was called Chatty Yung. Those gangsters called him that. He had a kid, remember? I remember, the kid had a cleft lips. He was always getting beaten by his father, what a poor kid. You're blocking the way. Sorry... And the wife? Such a pretty and attractive woman, did anyone pursue her? No, I don't think so. But the wife was quiet, she went about her own business all day long and didn't say much, just a little ball of anxiety who is always hiding away. She might've been beaten by her husband too much. How dare he frequently beat his own wife! But you really not knowing Wu Ying-yung? I didn't know him. Afterwards, I went to her husband. Are you Fung Yim's husband, Ma Tak-kwong? Yes, what's the matter? I'm Crime Squad Sergeant Lok Ying-choi. Last time, a female officer questioned me at my place. I've said all that's need to be said. Nothing to add. So it turns out that you're a renovation worker. You have been earning money these past few years, right? You keep your wife hidden up in there, don't you worry that she might be seeing other men? What did you say? Not much, just repeating some neighborhood gossip about her. Watch your words, officer. I could report you. Hey, take it easy there. I just want to know... Whether you think your wife and Wu Ying-yung are having an affair that you're unaware? I trust my wife, they're not having an affair. Don't you mind that you're wife's cuckolding you? Quit the drastic measures. It won't work for me, there is nothing you can do. If they're earlier confession was similar to Wu Cheuk-man, I wouldn't be suspicious. Have a think. Of course people with demons within have to disassociate themselves, so I went to Chan Wing-chiu's place afterwards and discovered a little clue. How long were you and Yan Fung-ping acquainted? They lived there for two or three years. I met them as soon as they moved into their subdivided room, because the property was my boss. I would sometimes visit there to collect the rent for my boss. It was only after you two were acquainted for two or three years that you started living together in Shenzhen? Was there anyone messing around with other peoples' wives before? She was so beautiful, did you have anything going on earlier already? No. It only began after we moved to Shenzhen. - You are home. - Yes. There is food on that table, go have some. I'm having a chat with the police. That's not reasonable. The order of events is not right. So you were just friends at the time you two lived together, yet you were taking her kid around? Did you not find this all very strange? Were you both really not intimate with one another back then? No, we really weren't at first. Are you that good at heart? Did you register your marriage? Sure, we get registered in the City Hall when returning to Hong Kong in 2013. You shouldn't have known that Wu Ying-yung was already dead then, so how did you register? Fung-ping and Wu Ying-yung never got married, they just simply lived together. Kid, you like rugby? This is famous, called Lacrosse, You use this mallet to hit the ball. You're not familiar with it? You really don't know much, do you? I didn't give it much thought at first. Who have thought that just one day later, when I return to the account's place to do anthor investigation... We really have nothing to add, there is nothing more we can talk about. Everything you want to know, we've told you. Okay, only if we could trouble you to talk about it once again. What was your relationship to Scar Yung and his family again? As I've said, none. We had no relation to him, we weren't familiar with him. He didn't stay very long in the neighboring apartment, "Hong Kong Rugby Tournament" I thought he had just moved away only. It's only now that I've discovered he passed away. That's all. How about you? As I've said, I didn't know him. I didn't know him nor his family, not at all. You went to visit your girlfriend frequently, did ever you stay there overnight? Of course not. I lived with my family before I got married. If it wasn't for that incident, I wouldn't have asked her to move out and live with me. That incident? What incident? Well, after Scar Yung moved away, the Landlady wanted us to move away. She said she needed to take back the property for renovations and that we have to leave. - This is the reason... - Yeah, right. Since we were unhappy there anyway, the neighbours were a pain in the neck. "Hong Kong Lacrosse Association Championship" I followed the address on the certificate to that Lacrosse Club and check on his relationship with the kid. What could you ask at the the club? Right, what could you ask at the club? Nothing at all, because it's confidential. It's obvious that her husband had something to hide from you, so how did you follow up then? So I went to question Chan Wing-chiu again, and see if there is anything fishy. You said you weren't acquainted with Chan Wing-sang, right? I didn't know him. But we checked once at the Lacrosse Club, he has been your son's coach for quite awhile. All this equipment was gifted by him to your son. You say you don't know Chan Wing-sang, but he was teaching your son Lacrosse the whole time. I knew my son was playing Lacrosse, but never getting involved beyond. You've been lying the whole time, the whole situation is full of such coincidences. Everyone moved away at once after Wu Ying-yung passed away, and you even shacked up with the deceased's wife, Whether or not they collaborated to kill Wu Ying-yung, and then moved the body to the basement for burial? Because Wu Ying-yung violated Chan Wing-sang's girlfriend, that's why Chan Wing-sang killed him. Did he bribe you? This was all down to Chan Wing-sang's doing, right? No, it had nothing to do with him. Nothing to do with him, but anything to do with you? Wait a second, so you won't charge Chan Wing-sang if I admit the murder? One man's actions is one man's responsibility, just confess if you're responsible. Fine. I confess, I committed the murder. Wait a second, let me very warn you very clearly. You have the right to remain silent, but anything you say may be used against you in a court of law. Understood? Understood. Proceed. I murdered Wu Ying-yung. It was purely a dispute between ourselves, I couldn't stand by and watch him beat Fung-ping, and him forcing Tung to smuggle drugs for him. He came to my room one day, he said I fancied his wife and blackmailed me for money, so we got into an argument. I forcefully pushed him against the wall, his head made contact and he instantly died. Afterwards, I buried his body underneath the staircase. You have a problem with this, you said you warned him in the written confession, and it would be okay as long as he signed the confession. But now, the acused said you misled him, which means you are responsible for Obstructed of Justice. Detective Lok Ying-choi, you are investigating a murder case. Why would you go by yourself, but not bringing any backup? Miss Chan. Firstly, I immediately warned Chan Wing-chiu before taking his confession. And he lied, not me. Secondly, if you want to know why I went on my own to investigate, it's because I was seeing a crime boss, named Fatty Wai. Hurry up, hit the ball at an angle over there and move aside! - There is no need to aim... - I am police. So you're Wong Kwok-wai? No, I know nothing. I'm from Team Two of Cheung Sha Wan District Crime Squad, Detective Tong Ka-Lung. I want to ask for your help with our investigation into the case of Wu Ying-yung's body. I didn't know him. Don't know who? I haven't even asked you anything, yet you say you don't know him? Fine. Ask away. I'm hoping you can help us out with this case regarding Wu Ying-yung's body. And I'm telling you seriously, I know nothing and I didn't know him! How did you not know him? Are you messing around with me? I'm asking you, you messing with me? Back off. Why hit the cue ball with a red? Are you What is it? You can always mishit the cueball, right? - Or else, what do you want? - That's right. Back off! Ten officers were called to offer backup then, it was quite a hassle. I thought maybe we have a generation gap, that's all. So I went tracking down Fatty Wai all by myself afterwards, I didn't dare bring him with me. Cheers! Hey, Choi. Come out and have a chat if you have time, let's have a gathering among friends. So, let's have a chat now. We dug up a corpse underneath of the stairs of a basement, you must have heard about it, right? I've seen that in the papers. The deceased is Wu Ying-yung, nicknamed Scar Yung, am I right? Nicknamed Scar Yung? He tricked people, his nickname is Chatty Yung. This guy worked in the fruit market who fell and hurt himself for some reason when transporting goods, he started calling himself Scar Yung as he got a scar on his face then. As I said, he was just a trash. Wait a second, Detective Lok. This is a murder case, you can't just make up scenarios by your own self. I didn't deliberately go out of my way to handle the case by myself. Firstly, my superiors wasn't supportive in this endeavor. Secondly, my current colleagues are really troublesome. They are just disturbing the investigation. Are you talking about me? I am not the one that doesn't understand the rules, who didn't show himself clearly nor warning the other party properly. All information we collected so hard just become useless now. So do you know who is this? Seriously, you spend the whole day investigating. But in fact, what were you investigating? Honestly, how would I have known that you would've be luckily that Chan Wing-chiu would confess to the murder at the meantime. Do you know it was just a fluke? - Mr Santos. - Yes. At that time, my team was actually investigating another murder case and a serious assault case in the underworld. There wasn't enough manpower. Yet he still had to investigate this hopeless case, how was I supposed to assign officers to his case? Sometimes that investigating and searching for evidence, doing it by yourself is always more convenient. You know the police nowadays are very law abiding. - What's wrong with abiding rules? - Do have to talk like this? You are the who know Fatty Wai in person, not me. Do you want me to catch Fatty Wai tomorrow and beat him up in front of you? Don't you think that knowing Fatty Wai means any different. Nowdays, no police will ever get drunk with the gangsters. Well, having drinks with Fatty Wai is such a glaring mistake! And too much old school! You don't need to argue, please stay at ease... Let's go on with Chan Wing-chiu's case. Fine. From him admitting to murder onwards, I immediately arrested him back to the Police Station to take transcript at once and get a further confession. Before the deceased's passing, how long had you been having an affair with his wife? Nothing. Nothing happened beforehand. Even at the time Wu Ying-yung died, we didn't immediately begin an affair then. It was only after we went to Shenzhen, that we began consummating the affair. Don't mock my intelligence. His wife was gorgeous, didn't you have any intentions for her before? No, I really didn't. At the start, it was all about for her kid. The kid was really adorable, but no kids would play with him because of his Cleft lips. He was so lonely which reminded me of myself at that age, that's why I wanted to take care of him. Do you want to grab a bite? Thanks. Who gave you this cake? The guy with the scarred face. I told you many times, no taking things from strangers. So you got close to her through her kid, in order to get intimate with the wife? No, I had no such intentions. Everyone say they have no intention, no one will really admit it, right? I really didn't. I didn't, Officer. I've seen the confession that he himself admitted to the murder, but so what? I then questioned his son. What is your relationship with Wu Ying-yung? My dad treats my mother and me without a single bit of goodness. If it's not scolding, it's a beating. He even forces me to smuggle drugs for him. Here, stand up straight. - Remember what to do later? - Yes. Good boy. Hand the bottle to uncle, Remember this. He was awful beyond compare. I've got something to talk to you about. What is it? I'm taking our son away to live. What did you say? Where did you bring him yesterday? I don't want you lording over me, okay? No, you can't force him to smuggle drugs. That will be the end of him! How dare you want to leave? Fine! Leave if you dare! I'm warning you, don't you ever think of leaving! Or I'll kill you both, do you hear me? You piece of trash! After I realized that he was using me to smuggle drugs, I was terrified. I really was! Come on, over here. - What's inside the bag? - Check it for yourself. Stupid kid, how dare you threw my goods away! How dare you stupid kid! You were born ugly and so useless. Please don't hit him... He made you so much money, please don't beat him. Whatever money he makes me, the supplier wants an indemnity as one hundred thousand dollars. Please don't hit him. I'll pay the missing sum, please? Okay, as you say so. Maybe because I was bullied a lot since I was a kid that they all laughed at my cleft lips, so I had very low self esteem and rarely went out to play. Once I saw the door to the rooftop area open and out of curiosity I went to take a look. What're you doing, kid? What's this? Why's it moving? Why's it moving? Oh, the wind does that. You never seen this before? This is a paper man. After someone dies in a family, It's burnt in their name. And they'll receive it in the hereafter. Tung, what're you doing here? Come over here. Are you okay? Why'd you bring my kid here? He came here himself. Is that so? Yes. We'll be leaving. Afterwards, I encountered his father a couple of times. Made a mental note that not to butt heads with him the next time. I didn't, I just want fifty dollars to join the school picnic. Next time, you want money, just wait until dad isn't home and ask me then. I'll give it to you, okay? Kid. Come out. Come on. Does your hand hurt? Put this in the fridge, it'll freeze up pretty soon. Place it on your hands then, it'll help ease the pain. Okay? In the following days, he would treat me with food frequently and played with me in his spare time. - You lose. - Oh, no. Look! It's your turn, hurry up! You cheat. It's my turn now. Come on, be careful. No rush, pull it gently. Right, release it slowly. Tung, are you flying kite? - Is it fun? - Very fun. I've bought some bread, do you eat it? Sausage bread and raisin bread. Thank you. Son, do you want to eat? Wait a second. Tung, superheros are mighty. Is this the Quantum Magnetic Man? It is the Lighting Man, silly. - Isn't that the same? - Of course not. He is call Lighting Man, this superhero's name Is that so? You know what? Lighting Man's killer move is Quantum Slash, he cuts opens the monster's stomach with only one strike. What? And annihilates the monster. Do you know that? This is too complicated, what're you saying? Doesn't Superman fire death rays to kill the monster? What death rays? I've no idea what you're on about. Stand here. Look at me. Why are you so cheap? You know those idiots just wants to catch a look under your dress, why have you still walking by the railings? Why can't you just passing by near the wall! I didn't know anyone was down by the railings. What's wrong with you? How dare you talk back? You just don't listen! Just do what I told you to! You're so such a trash. What a lowlife! I'll kill you. What a lowlife! Stand up! Where did you take my Lighting Man? So impressive! What do you think? Put on Quantum Man's head here, then it's finished. So help me out. Take the glue and apply it here evenly, I'll help you fix it up, come on. Be slow. Nice, you are doing good. Impressive, you are doing better than me. Take it easy, don't pull too hard. Right. It seems that you guys had a good relationship. Was he trying to use you to pursue your mother? No, this was no such thing. Actually, he wasn't together with mother yet when we lived there. Let's collect them tomorrow. Workers will come retrieve it and brought it to funeral home tonight. It was going to rain soon, let's moved out quickly, Hurry up! Tung, quick help over here. Oh, this is terrible! Fung-ping, help me open the canvas. Tung, why are you crying? Are you hurt? Their living space's been destroyed, they have no home now. What a tragic! Silly boy, don't cry. They won't be homeless. Don't cry. If all the goods are wet, I won't have a home. Quick, come and help. Let's give him a hand, okay? Oh, no... It's gone! It doesn't matter, we'll work hard. Get those inside first. Here. I haven't given up on this yet, so I went back and cross-examine to Chan Wing-chiu. You are having rheumatoid arthritis, not impotent like some other men. You are just a normal guy, am I right? Look at my face, disfigured and ugly, My hands and legs deformed. Why would I have courage? So what did your relationship start as? It's dark now, why are you sitting here all alone? This is one level higher than the rooftop, shouldn't it be the sixth floor? Don't be stupid, the attic shouldn't be considered as one floor. We live on the fourth floor. Your kid is adorable, so you should not overthink it. I know. Early on it was because of Fung-ping, she started taking care of me very well. I never had someone treat me that well. What is it? Here it says, drinking this is good for your eczema. Let's see what is the recipe, I'll buy some today and boil it into a soup for you tonight. I told you not to waste money on it, there's no use. Not only that, there are some Chinese medicines can help relieve your joint pain too. I'll take a look of it. It doesn't look bad at all, what is this soup? This one? It is the carrot and pork soup, good for your eczema. As I said, no need to make a soup for me especially. I'm not making it for you especially, we can all drink it together to cool off in the heat. Wait a second. I almost forgot something. Almost forgot what? See? What is this? Give it a try, see if it's more convenient. Are these chopsticks? How do I use them? Give me that. Like this, fip it the other way around. Let me try it. It's really useful. Let me try, hand it over. You can use that one, leave this one for me. Your mother bought it for me. - Thanks. - Alright, let's eat. Impressive. Chiu, take off your shirt and sit on the couch. - Isn't it expensive? - Not at all. People say this medicine is good for rheumatoid arthritis, so try it. Slowly. It's okay. - Is it hot? - No. - Comfy? - Yes. Well, then have for a bit longer. I'll heat it up again and let try the other side. - Okay. - Hold this. Tung, you are about to do your homework now. After putting on that medicine, it's more comfortable now. But after she passed away, there is never again. Come on, come closer! Let's take a photo there, okay? Come on. Look at me, simle. One, two, three. Nice. One more. Okay, ready. Do we have to? There's lots of people taking photos here. There are so many people, forget it. Just a minute, it won't take long. Alright, it's our turn now. Be quick! Come on! Look at the camera. Hey, my hands aren't long enough. Hey, you take it. Look, am I pretty? Okay, let's take the photo. Quickly. Why don't you look happy today? Is there something wrong? No, it's nothing. If nothing's wrong, give us a smile then. Mother, come along. I am coming, do you find a good place to snap photos? This building is beautiful. Why don't we take a photo together? Let's take a photo of the three of us! Alright, get ready! No, this won't do, Why don't we get someone to help taking the photos for us? No need. Excuse me, can you help us to take a photo? I'm very busy, sorry. - Why don't you go help her? - Alright. Just listen to me. Why bother of it? Why don't I help you guys to take a photo? Sure, great! - Thanks. - It's okay. - Just pressing this button will do. - Okay. Ready, one, two, three! Okay, you may take a look and see if it's fine. Thank you, that will do! You're welcome. Have you taken enough photos then? Are we ready to go home now? What's up with you today? It seem like you're unhappy and got a lot on your mind the whole day. Today's our wedding. You have taken enough photos, they all look alike to me, okay? I'm really tired. Let's go home, I'm feeling pains. You want to go, right? You may leave now! It's my fault, please don't be angry, okay? Let's go home and talk. What is going on with you today? What's happened? Not that. Today's our wedding, and I don't have anything to give you. I don't feel good about it, you know? We've signed the Marriage Certificate, why do we have to keep taking photos? I'm not handsome. This is the happiest day of my life. Why can't you let me take a few more photos? And rejoice in the moment for a bit longer? What joy does taking photographs bring you? Just look at us. Why do we have to take photos like they do? Why do we have to embarrass ourselves here? Enough, let's go home now. Please? Just grab a bite to eat somewhere, okay? I've never liked comparing myself to others, because I know that we can never compare ourselves to others. I just want to live a simple life with you. As long as you and I are both happy, that's enough for me. Why do you want to compare yourself with others? I know. But I just feel that I am so useless, I don't have anything to give you. Everyone's so happy upon getting married with everything around, yet I have nothing to give you. You have took all these photos, but what's there worth to remember? Actually, all girls dream about a lavish wedding and gliding into the church with a beautiful wedding dresses. Also, having a big ceremony as well. But all I want to tell you is no matter how big and lavish the ceremony, I just don't want it if you're not there. Because the only thing I love is you. Did you rinse your mouth? So unhygienic. What do you mean? Wait a second. Do I call you father from now on? What do you think? Of course, you'll call me dad. Tsui-fan's husband is so nice, he help Tung to find a really good high school. Should we move back to Hong Kong next year? Sure, the most important thing is Tung's studies. But, if we move back to Hong Kong, the living expenses will be higher than Shenzhen now. I've spoken to Sister Yu, I'll work at a supermarket then and change to full-time job. Well, let see if I can work as a paper craftsman like I used to. Good. Your ring is on the infected area, will it cause pain if you wear it all day? I don't know, we'll see about it when it happens. That's no good, take it off. Of course not, a wedding ring must be worn. No, just take it off first. I have an idea. What's it? A magic trick? See? Isn't this the same? In fact, I think it looks even better this way. Really? Is that okay? Just wearing it this way? You don't believe me, just take a look yourself. Before Fung-ping died, I remember what she told me then. That day was the second day she stopped taking cancer medication and we were about to let her go. Maybe it's the flashback that people often talk about, she was particularly calm and serene that day. We talked a lot on that day about a lot of things, and she died the next day. Tung, buy orange juice for me. I'll buy it for you. Chiu. What's the matter? I'm think it's time for me to go. I am sorry that I can't stand this medication anymore, and the pain is unbearable. You won't resent me, will you? Why would I resent you? You've taken care of me so well these five years, it's been the happiest five years of my life. The only thing I resent is that I wasn't useful enough. I'm ugly and poor, I haven't been able to bring you a good happy life these years. I should say sorry to you insteaf. Actually, I think that the five years with you have also been the happiest five years in my life. I mean it. I've always wondered, what do you love about me? What is there worth loving about me? Maybe you are just pitying me? But it doesn't matter. Even if you only pitied me, I still thank you for everything. I never pitied you. I admired you. Admired me? What's there to admire about me? Please don't joke. Admiring me for my deformed face or my inflamed joints? Actually, the moment I feel in love with you was that evening. I never seen such a brave man. Once I saw you, I knew that no matter whoever is with you would get all the love from you and protection. What're you talking about? I got beaten by someone, is that brave? A person who initiates scuffles with a weaker individual, that's beating people. A person who takes part in an evenhanded scuffle, that's a fight. But knowing that you will lose and even maybe beaten to death, you still stand up and fight against those rotten people. This is a hero. You're my hero. Hey. Take good care of yourself, okay? When I accused Chan Wing-chiu of murder, all the tenants came back to change their confessions. I lived by myself at the time in a subdivided rooms. I don't know how he know about shortfall at the time, not knowing if he was eavesdropping or something. But he was always using this to threaten and blackmail me. I didn't know what to do, I was very afraid. I couldn't tell my husband about this situation. Other than this, anymore? Yes. So it wasn't a one-off? No, there were multiple incidents. For how long? One month and a bit. This case is very strange. The pregnant woman I'm going to talk about was even much more weird. - Pregnant woman? - Yes. That witness is Cheung Tsui-fan, who was pregnant at the time, I lived here for years, and I always had a bad feeling about that Wu Ying-yung is very nasty. I was packing things in my room one day, I suddenly felt really dizzy and had to lie down. Afterwards, Wu Ying-yung came into my room and took of my clothes. I remembered there is lighting, when I woke and tried to sit up. It turns out that he had been taking nude photos of me, then he blackmailed me with those photos and said... I know your boyfriend is rich. While you were remain unconscious right now, I have snapped a lot of photos and short videos too. Now listen, you must be of service to me in the future. Otherwise, you know what I can do. And it won't be good for you if your boyfriend finds out. Did he ask you to sleep with him again? Yes, and not only once! Afterwards, I told my boyfriend about this and we moved to my boyfriend's house soon. That Wu Ying-yung was a monster, everyone wanted to kill him. Why would it necessarily be Chiu? It wasn't Chiu. One woman already became the wife of an accountant while the rapist had already died, Why would she talk about this shameful unfortunate incident now? The accountant and his wife became suspects instantly after spoke up, because they had the motive to murder as well. That's right. That means they have a motive, they may commit murder to revenge. A woman just passed out suddenly when she is packing up? It doesn't seem like a coincidence. It should be... Sir, you have an investigate brain. That's what I guess so. Do you agree? He poured the Gamma Hydroxybutyrate into the cup while the girl's away, that's very reasonable. Also, there is another issue related to the young model. She won't come out to give testimony as a witness, so I didn't put this down in the report. How many other details have you not put in the report? Don't you need to report to your superiors? I have already reported to my superiors. Every time you do it before telling me anything, you have never notified me about the situation beforehand. This information is useless to the case, Fatty Wai told us about it only to let us know that the deceased is a terrible person. But no matter what, you have to inform me in advance. You two did not have a tacit understanding, and neither party believes the other. You are still not accepting this new member. And as a newly transferred member, you never get along with the rest of the officers. You've firstly got to not argue. Now tell me about the young model incident. It is about eight or nine years ago. - Do you remember Miss Jing? - I remember. She came to seek me out. - Let's have tea. - Let me do it... - Are you blind? - Sorry... Hey, she is... Ball Ball Angel! It's Soccer Angel, Brother Wai. - What is it? - Brother Wai. The facts is that she was assaulted a few months ago and was snapped several nude photos. Now, that used the photos to blackmail her. If she gets famous and those photos leak out, it'll be a horrible situation, Brother Wai. Nothing will happen with me around! What a girl, who takes those photos of you? Is that your boyfriend? No! He just make me unconscious, then took all those nude photos and blackmail me. And that's what happened, I was threatened by him since then. Actually, Miss Jing helped me to get rid of him, but I'm still terrified that those photos would getting out. You have to help me, Brother Wai. Alright, say no more. I will help her. Please don't hit me! This is all? - Nothing else? - There is none left. So remember, you're finished if the photos of this girl have been leaked. I'll come back deal with you. Of course not! Listen. - Look me in the eyes. - Sure. One of my brothers at To Kwa Wan, Scar Yung said you've been using his name for clout. Is that it? Remember, you're just Chatty Yung, not Scar Yung. - Understand? - I knows... Brother Wai, they were just talking nonsense. It has nothing to do with me. They were talking nonsense? How dare you blame on the others? Hey, you wasted my time all morning. Kei, come over. I'm afraid that he'll forget, you help leave him a reminder. - Come on, let's go eat breakfast. - No, Brother Wai! Leave what as a reminder? Leave a mark on his forehead. But Fatty Wai asked me to fetch him later on. What news do you have for me? About the case you were talking about last time, everyone knows about it now. The Disfigured Superman Murder case? It's just Disfigured Chiu. Doesn't matter, he's ugly. I have a friend who wants to speak to you. But, she wants you to promise her that she won't be a witness and won't go to the court. That's fine. Are you sure? She is my boss's girlfriend. Of course, she's not his only girlfriend. Well, if you say so... Sure, don't worry. We must keep our promises, Detective Lok. Am I not doing that now? Alright, fine... The piece of paper is stated that I should go to Central Pier 9 with a white rose. So you're Detective Lok? Yes. Have a seat. Please. Thank you. No big deal, it's just a sign. To be honest, the reason I invite you here has something to do with the case of Chan Wing-chiu. But whatever I tell you now, I ask that you won't divulge to anyone else. Of course. Nine years ago, I was a street prostitute at Tai Nam West Street. A street prostitute? I had illegally immigrated to Hong Kong at the time. I knew whoever want to become a Hong Kong Citizen, the easiest way was to arrange for a fake marriage. But a fake marriage cost about one to two hundred thousand dollars, how would I have had that much money back then? So I plucked up the courage to come down to Hong Kong myself, I made money and saved up around thirty thousand dollars and found a man who would enter into a fake marriage with me. The whole situation was more simple than I'd expected. This was it? However, why are you telling me this? I had a customer at the time, who was the deceased in this case, Wu Ying-yung. Do you want me? - I want you, go on. - Let's go. He wasn't a regular customer, solicited a few times of my service. But one time, he even brought me to his home. Come on. Come in. Hold my hand. Come with me. Here. Here we are. Come here! Hey, give me a kiss! - Alright... - Come. Good girl. Where's the shower? Don't be so rush. Come sit down, let's have a chat. Why bother? Come on, let's chat Chat about what? Not much. I don't want to use condom. Of course not, it protects everyone. Let's take a shower first. What are you standing there for? Get lost! Why are you coming back so early? You are disturbing me! Tung. Let's go out. Don't go! Sit down. Why don't we have a threesome? You're crazy! Who told you I was interested in that? I'll pay you double! - Let go of me! - Let's have a threesome! - Don't you dare to leave, come over! - Let me go! - Let go! - We're having a threesome. I don't want it! Stop! You disfigured, get lost. Yung, stop that! Are you helping him? You think that he is insane, and you can't bear to have a threesome with them involved? No, I... His most perverse thing was he never take his kid out of his room, and already started to talk about having a threesome. I cannot bear someone so disgusting like him! He's not a person! A pregnant woman. A fugitive. A young model. And now, there is another beautiful mistress willing to give testimony about being a street prostitute before. There is only one possibility that Wu Ying-yung is such a trash who is both hateful and monstrous, That's why everyone has a motive for him to die. I guess so, my thinking is that lots of people want Chan Wing-chiu to get away. You saw how I was talking to your former superior. I saw it, that is Ma Man-chiu. Right. I wanted to ask him why he transferred you. Actually, what's this Lok Ying-choi? He's worked with me for a long time, who is very competent. I've tried countless times to get him to come back to work for me but all end up unsuccessfully. In my Anti-Drug Squad, there were no issues. Until one day... Choi. There's something I want to speak to you about, do you have time? Sure, go ahead. Come with me. Detective Luk. Our Anti-Prostitution Team went to the King Hotel yesterday, and in one of those rooms... We found your wife. Yes, the client has already admitted to it. I thought I should come and let you know in advance. If these matters are publicized, you'll face a lot of trouble. We are both men, you should understand what I mean. I'm sorry. So, we'd originally suspected that there are some problems with you. Could you shed a light on this whole situation for us? From my perspective, there's really not much more to say. You have suspicions and you now have the chance to voice them clearly. You have problems and haven't been able to give clear explanations, we really can't help you out if anything happen to this then. Two days after that, Officer Ma Man-chiu told me to go to his office, Chief. Have a seat. No need, standing will do. Just sit. Okay. Choi. This incident has caused us a lot of trouble. I really hope this whole thing has nothing to do with you. Our Squad places greatest importance on ethical conduct of each members. I understood. There is a matter involving your wife. The Anti-Prostitution Team found some cash in her account, which is over seven million dollars. All deposited in cash within the past two years. There is no way to track it down, how could we find the source now? The Internal Affairs Department is currently investigating this. You must understand, I need to transfer you this time. I'm arranging with the superiors to transfer you to Regional Crime Squad which is much less stressful. Avoid the onslaught of troubles there, then come back and report to me after everything is cleared. Thank you, officer. In fact, Officer Ma has told me all about it just now. He said that your wife very honestly confessed all the money came from her being a prostitute. His wife was very cooperative, gave us all the information to Internal Affairs Department. All the paying customers were clearly laid out to us, she admitted it all. Choi is very lucky, he'll be proved innocent soon. She really wants to help you. Am I treating you bad? Everything I do is out of respect and out of the love I have for you. Are we not happy? After we are together, why do you have to do that? Think about yourself. Yes, we're happy together, but there's never a sense of stability between us. Well, what're you thinking then? Actually, women just focus on feelings sometimes. We've been together eight years, I don't care if you don't want to get married to me. In this period of time, all gathering about your family, your friends or colleagues, everyone brings their wives. But did you bring me along? How many times has this happened? I can count the total number of times with two hands. It's obvious you think bringing me along is embarrassing and shameful, and you don't want to let others know that I am with you. It doesn't matter if I an anonymous, but you even never bringing me out and introducing me to your family and your friends as your wife or your girlfriend. Women can always tell the way they had been treated. I know that you look down on me. I've always been afraid of the day you'd return home and say that you're tired of me. Because you finally realised that you can't stand having a prostitute as your wife. Do you understand? I also need to think for myself. At the beginning, I didn't want to let you know. I never expected that you would know about it all sooner or later, and got caught by your station's Anti-Prostitution Team. This was destiny. I think that is it then, okay? Just treat it as if we are over now and never seeing each other again. I'm grateful for your honesty. Otherwise, it is hard for me to sort it out on my own. One man's actions is one man's responsibility, I just want to speak the truth. She's beautiful when dolled up. I'm sorry, excuse me for a bit. I need to go too. Those people don't even have any sense of decency. - Yes. - It's dirty everywhere. Just flush after using the toilet, okay? It's that simple, such a filthy and dirty man! Mollie, what more is there to say? We need to ask about why changing of the confessions. Detective Lok. Disfigured Chiu went about changing his confession by himeself and told the defense lawyer that you did not verbally warn him before getting a confession. He had also said that you told him that if he confessed, you wouldn't persecute anyone else or investigate any further comrades. I asked that officer, whether they wouldn't arrest the accountant if I confessed. The officer told me that he wouldn't arrest anyone else if I confessed to murder. Then, he told his defense lawyer... Maybe I was so stupid that thinking they would be just fine if I confessed guilty. After thinking it through, I realized murder matters. That way I want to tell the truth. And this is the best way for him to get away. His lawyer was assigned to him by the government, so I don't think he would be instructed in unlawful ways. But on this basis, this invalidates all confessions we are having now. Your confession was officially made after he was detained at the police station. And when you got that confession at his place, there was just you. He said you misled him, which is opposed to the confession. To be honest, if this case went to court, our legal defense is very weak. For Chan Wing-chiu to aim at this very mistake, he must be very familiar with law and needing someone like you who investigate homicides on one's own without bringing other officers as eyewitnesses. If there were other policeman who listened in on him confession or heard that you have been verbally warning him, all these would never have happened then. So what is the truth? Did someone teach him how to do this? I've already explained very clearly, no one could accompany me then. Right, there's another thing which seems strange as well. I checked out the Lai Chi Kok Reception Centre on the tapes of you interrogating Chan Wing-chiu, and I saw... So, no one helped? No, it was all me. What were you doing with your hands? What did you shove into his pocket? Did you not put a piece of paper into his pocket? I did no such thing, never. Were you coaching him on giving a false statement? No. Is there no need to do a body search on the accused? No. Not after police have questioned the accused in the detention center, they don't need to be searched then. Even if they're being searched, it'll be aimed for larger objects. Like drugs, weapons. Couldn't he request for turning off the recording devices? Why taking such risk? I've never heard of an officer having the guts to request turning off recording devices in detention facility. I never gave him a piece of paper, he make up this lie all by himself. It has nothing to do with me. Well, we will record all these in the files, Let see if there was a chance to find some more clues the other day. Okay. Do we need to discuss the murder weapon? Wait a moment. Do we have a floor plan of Wu Ying-yung's room? - Here. - Let me see about it now. Here. Mr Santos is doing it again. He really likes crime re-enactment. Three steps for me is a meter. I always use this as a measurement, it's accurate. The room is this big, three meters here with four meters there. The spousal bed is here and the kid's bed is there while that is the doorway. Come here. Hey, give me a kiss! Alright... What a girl. Come sit down, let's have a chat. Why bother? Chat about what? Not much. They were flirting with one another in while. And soon, the wife and child came back. What are you standing there for? Get lost! Why are you coming back so early? You are disturbing me! What a fool! When they were all screaming and clamoring, the prostitute got into the fight. Why don't we have a threesome? You're crazy! Who told you I was interested in that? This is insane, I'm leaving! - Let's have a threesome! - Let me go! Come here! Let me go! During the fight, Chan Wing-chiu came in the room from this door. - We're having a threesome. - Let go! Stop! You disfigured, get lost. Yung, stop that! The prostitute took the opportunity and just left by this doorway. Are she leaving? Well, what about the fight? Why stopping now? I don't think the matter ended here. After the prostitute left, they all just stop fighting? It doesn't make sense. Something must've happened. Stop! How dare you try to stop me! Get off! How dare you try to stop me! Please stop! How dare you trying to help him? Please stop... Doesn't it hurt? So as this leg! And Wu Ying-yung just died here. Mr Santos, this version you're talking about now is entirely different from Chan Wing-chiu's version of it. There's absolutely no chance that Chan Wing-chiu's version is true. You disfigured, have you hooked up with my wife? What do you mean by hooked up with your wife? Didn't you? I didn't hook up with your wife. What do you want? - Is it painful? - I didn't... - I didn't hook up with your wife! - What did you say? - Are you lying? - I really didn't! - Is that true? - I really didn't! I didn't! He was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, who wouldn't have had the strength to overpower that Chatty Yung. The whole scenario is impossible in this case. Is it possible that Yan Fung-ping helped him to move the corpse into the basement? Impossible. No, we had no way of moving him. What about this? What if we cut him up? No, the body wasn't cut up. Come on. If the incident continues to develop, this is the only possibility I can come up with. What happened? Move him aside. What should we do now? We should report it. This is murder! Then what should we do? Why don't we just bury him? In where? Come on out. Stand aside. No, I can't hold it any longer! Be careful! Hurry up! I've already said, with a body this heavy, cutting it into pieces will make it easier to move. Wasn't we asked about who would do it just now? But none of us have the guts! Is it that we brought it upstairs and you will cut it up? - Stop making a fuss! - Is it not? Quieten down, do you want to be caught? How are we going to we move all this garbage? - Put him down first. - Quieten down! Do you want the people upstairs to be woken up? Be careful. Sir, I know a bit about the qualities of cement. This wouldn't work. Firstly, we'd need a board or building a brick wall to about the height of the water tank, so that you can place the corpse within. Finally, pour in the cement. At the site, we found that the person burying the body had much experience. He understood that he needed to put a lot of bricks in the hole first before pouring in the cement. He didn't want to mix too much cement on site, because the process takes a long time. If you say that Chan Wing-chiu had been doing all these on his own, that's just impossible. This is what had happened. But if you had to wait for the brick wall to dry, it would take two days at the very least before you can pour in the cement. Therefore, unless they had prepared well in advance, they would've had to find a place to put the body for two days and waited for the brick wall to dry before moving the body down and pouring in the cement. Careful with the cement, don't step on it. Oncce the brick wall was dry after two days, they moved the body down. Is there something wrong? You said two days later, but they hadn't even changed clothes. Come on... One, two, three. It's so heavy! I'll go and mix the cement, you guys help throw the bricks in. Bring the bricks, come on. What can I help? Help me adding water. In other words, when it comes to hiding corpses, the one raising the most red flags is renovation worker Ma Tak-kwong? Actually, I think that Chatty Yung is very hateful indeed. Not only did his wife want to kill him, but many other people as well. Besides them, there are the young model, Fatty Wai and that street prostitute, They all had motives to kill him, not to mention all those people who were hurt by him before. We may not even know all of them, but they all are possible. Sir, according to what you're saying, do we need to do a new investigation into this case? Wait a second, I have another important thing to say. I just went to the toilet and I saw a mess in there. Someone didn't flush the toilet, what would you do then? Should I just walking out and have a sweeping investigation throughout the Department of Justice that questioning and interrogating every colleague about who was so filthy and didn't flush after defecating, and then notified his superiors to punish or even dismiss the person? Why bother to interrogate people over some thing like this? Honestly, if anyone have come with this, wouldn't just flushing it away be enough? Am I right? Why is there the need for a racket just to find out who did that? One may just come out afterwards and tell everyone that to be cleaner and remember to flush after using. Why bother and cause as much trouble? Right? Sir, so what're you getting at? Don't misunderstand me, I'm just talking about what had happened at the toilet. Don't misinterpret anything from my statement. Let's get back to this case, Our Department of Justice is responsible for the prosecution, while your police department is responsible for investigation that is dedicated to uncovering this case with all their strength. You must thoroughly investigate about who killed Wu Ying-yung and it should be very clear that we can't let any culprits run loose. Understood? Understood and well received. Good. - Sir. - Yes. That's about all for today, right? Yes, that's about all. My apologies, I'm meeting someone for lunch. I'll head off then now. Sorry and bye for now. Bye... Bye. Apologies for taking up your time. If there's anything else, we'll speak on the phone. Okay. What do you want to do now? We should grab a bite to eat. Should we go for some brunch? That sounds good. Which one should we go? It is up to you. It's been pretty cold the past few days. It is even colder in jall.
