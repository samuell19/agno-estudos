[ fire crackling ] [ eerie music ] [ demonic growl ] [ tense music ] [ ELIZABETH whimpering ] [ demon snarls ] [ Elizabeth crying ] [ fire crackling louder ] [ LEAH moaning ] [ screaming ] [ music fades out ] LEAH: ESTHER, THAT'S NOT FUNNY. [ Esther laughing ] YOU COULD'VE GIVEN ME A HEART ATTACK. ALL THAT SCREAMING I THOUGHT YOU ALREADY HAD A HEART ATTACK. I COULD HEAR YOU ALL THE WAY FROM THE KITCHEN. SO YOU KNEW I WAS HAVING A NIGHTMARE. AND YOU STILL TRIED TO COME IN AND SCARE ME? TRIED? YOU SHOULD'VE SEEN YOUR FACE. [ Esther laughing ] YOU KNOW I'M NOT GOING TO LET YOU GET AWAY WITH THIS, RIGHT? WHY WERE YOU EVEN UP IN THE KITCHEN AT THIS HOUR? Esther: WELL, I KIND OF WOKE UP THIRSTY SO I WENT TO GO GET A DRINK. AND THEN I HEARD YOU. AND, SO INSTEAD OF COMING IN TO COMFORT ME... YOU JUST DECIDED TO BE A LITTLE JERK, INSTEAD? [ Esther laughing ] [ tender music ] Esther: WHAT WERE YOU DREAMING ABOUT? IT WAS NOTHING. DO YOU EVER DREAM ABOUT DADDY? NOT REALLY, LATELY. JUST THE NIGHTMARES. HOW ABOUT YOU? NOT AS MUCH AS I USED TO. MOSTLY IT'S ABOUT AYALA, ESTI, ABBY... AND OUR OLD HOUSE. Leah: WE'LL SEE EVERYONE SOON. ONE OF THESE WEEKENDS AFTER SHABBAT WE'LL GO FOR A VISIT, OKAY? WHAT DOES IT MEAN IF I'M NOT DREAMING ABOUT HIM ANYMORE? AM I FORGETTING HIM? NO. Leah: YOU'RE JUST GETTING USED TO OUR NEW LIFE. Leah: YOUR FATHER'S NOT COMING BACK. AS SOON AS WE CAN REALIZE THAT AND REALLY COPE WITH IT, THE BETTER. DO YOU LIKE IT HERE? I'M GETTING USED TO IT. IT'S DIFFERENT. QUIET. AND I HAVEN'T GOTTEN MANY CHANCES TO MAKE FRIENDS. BESIDES GRACE. YOU'RE A NICE GIRL. GIVE IT A LITTLE BIT OF TIME. OKAY? AND WE'LL BRANCH OUT. WE'LL CHECK OUT THE TEMPLE. WE'LL CHECK OUT THE SCHOOL IN LANCASTER. AND YOU'LL MAKE SOME GOOD FRIENDS. WHAT ABOUT YOU? WHAT ABOUT ME? WELL, DO YOU LIKE IT HERE? YOUR GRANDMA AND GRANDPA USED TO TAKE US... UP TO UPSTATE NEW YORK IN THE SUMMER. AND IT WAS... REALLY PEACEFUL AND QUIET. BEAUTIFUL. KIND OF LIKE IT IS HERE. SO YEAH. I LIKE IT. I'M GLAD. [ mysterious music ] [ mellow guitar music ] [ newspaper lands ] [ ominous music ] [ mellow guitar music continues ] [ footsteps on stairs ] I THOUGHT I SMELLED SOMETHING GOOD. WHAT'S GOTTEN INTO YOU THIS MORNING? I THOUGHT TAKING THE BIKE WOULD WEAR ME OUT AND - -HELP ME FALL BACK ASLEEP, BUT IT DID THE OPPOSITE. FIGURED I'D MAKE MYSELF USEFUL. COFFEE'S STILL FRESH. THANK YOU. AND YOU MADE ENOUGH FOR ESTHER. SHE SLEEP WITH YOU AGAIN? YEAH, UM. I HAD ANOTHER NIGHTMARE AND SHE CAME IN TO CHECK ON ME. Leah: ENDED UP STAYING. WHAT TIME? TWO. Leah: WHY? OH, NOTHING. Maya: I JUST THOUGHT I HEARD HER IN HER ROOM WHEN I GOT UP AT THREE. I WAS TIRED, THOUGH. Leah: I BET. WELL, THE NEXT FEW WEEKS OFF OUGHT TO BE NICE. YEAH, NOT FOR MY WALLET. WHAT ARE YOU MISSING? THERE'S REALLY NOTHING TO BUY OUT HERE, ANYWAY. GEE, THANKS MOM. RUB IT IN. THANK YOU, HONEY. FOR BREAKFAST. I NEVER WOULD'VE HAD TIME TO MAKE ANYTHING THAT GOOD. EVEN IF YOU HAD TIME, WE KNOW I'M THE BETTER COOK. OH YEAH? SO, WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN HAVING NIGHTMARES ABOUT? I DON'T EVEN LIKE TO THINK ABOUT IT. IT'S REALLY DISTURBING. I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE IT'S COMING FROM. LET'S JUST NOT. OKAY? MAYBE IT'S SOMETHING YOU NEED TO TALK THROUGH. Maya: ESPECIALLY IF IT'S HAPPENING EVERY NIGHT. I MEAN... WE COULD TRY TO FIGURE IT OUT, YOU KNOW? THERE'S NOTHING TO FIGURE OUT. Leah: NEW HOUSE. NEW ENVIRONMENT. JACOB. THAT'S IT. IF YOU SAY SO. OR. MAYBE IT IS SOMETHING. ESTHER'S BEEN SEEING- MAYA. SHHHH. WHAT HAS ESTHER BEEN SEEING? UM, SHE'S JUST TALKING A LOT. IN HER SLEEP. Maya: WAKING UP ALL HOURS OF THE NIGHT. WELL, THAT'S PRETTY NORMAL. WE ALL JUST HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF SETTLING IN TO DO. OKAY? GOT TO GO. LOVE YOU. LOVE YOU TOO. [ mysterious music ] REAL FUNNY, FAKER. SINCE WHEN DID YOU BECOME A NINJA, HUH? HOW'D YOU DO THAT? WHAT THE HECK? Esther: WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU? WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU? I THINK I JUST SAW SAMANTHA. NAIRA: ROUGH DAY SO FAR? NAIRA: THE DOOR WAS CRACKED OPEN. I KNOCKED BUT YOU DIDN'T EVEN BLINK. YEAH, SORRY. THERE'S SO MUCH GOING ON. I FORGET THERE'S A WORLD OUTSIDE OF THESE FORMS. YOU NEED TO ENJOY YOUR BREAK, LEAH. OTHERWISE WHAT'S THE POINT? YOU'RE RIGHT. I'LL EAT. Naira: NO YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO STOP WORKING UNLESS YOU GET AWAY FROM THAT DESK. WHY DON'T YOU JOIN ME OUTSIDE FOR A STROLL? LAPS AROUND THE PARKING LOT? THE WOODS IN THE BACK OF THE LOT HAVE TRAILS - THAT CONNECT THE DIFFERENT BUSINESSES. IT'S INTERESTING. I GO TO CLEAR MY HEAD. AND AVOID STARING AT THE SAME BORING FACES I'M ALREADY LOOKING AT- Naira: IN HERE ALL DAY. THANK YOU. OF COURSE. I TOLD YOU I HAD YOUR JOB FOR A COUPLE YEARS. I KNOW IF YOU DON'T DRAG YOURSELF AWAY YOU'LL JUST BURN OUT. WHICH ISN'T GOOD FOR ANYBODY. ESPECIALLY IF YOU'VE GOT KIDS AT HOME. DO YOU? NOPE. I HAD A HUSBAND FOR THE FIRST FEW YEARS I WORKED HERE. HE WAS ONE OF THE FOUNDING INVESTORS. HELPED YOUR BROTHER BUILD THIS PLACE. 'HAD A HUSBAND'? HE PASSED AWAY THREE YEARS AGO. I'M SO SORRY. WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME SOONER? [ scoffs ] I DIDN'T WANT TO BE ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE. WHAT? A WIDOW? NO, THOSE PEOPLE. YOU TELL THEM YOUR PARENTS DIED IN A CAR CRASH - THEY LOST THEIR FATHER IN A PLANE CRASH. AND THEIR MOTHER AFTER SHE BATTLED CANCER FOR 200 YEARS. THEY ALWAYS HAVE TO ONE-UP YOU. MAKE IT ALL ABOUT THEM. NOT DOING THAT. OKAY. I APPRECIATE THAT. [ laughs ] WE SUFFERED SIMILAR LOSSES THOUGH. IT'S OKAY TO TALK ABOUT IT. WE DON'T HAVE TO COMPARE NOTES OR ANYTHING. FAIR ENOUGH. AND, YOU'D WIN ANYWAY. ALEX DIED IN HIS SLEEP. UNKNOWN CAUSES. AND I DIDN'T HAVE TO TALK TO THE KIDS ABOUT IT. COULDN'T IMAGINE. EVERY HEART KNOWS IT OWN GRIEF. YOU DO HAVE SOMETHING TO REMEMBER HIM BY. YEAH. HOW LONG WERE YOU GUYS TOGETHER? WE WERE HIGH SCHOOL SWEETHEARTS. EIGHT YEARS. WE WANTED TO EXPLORE THE WORLD BEFORE HAVING KIDS. SO WE WERE HOLDING OFF UNTIL WE WERE 35. Naira: THEN HE PASSED. VERY SUDDENLY. Naira: AND WE LOST THAT CHANCE. ALTHOUGH HE DID LEAVE ME A FORTUNE. AND THAT DOESN'T COME WITH MESSY DIAPERS OR TEENAGE ANGST, OR... ANY OF THAT NONSENSE. [ both laughing ] [ eerie music ] WHAT IS THAT? AH, THE PEOPLE HERE ARE VERY SUPERSTITIOUS. THIS IS AN OFFERING FOR CONTINUED PROSPERITY. DID SOMEONE WE WORK WITH DO THAT? Naira: POSSIBLE. BUT 30 OTHER BUSINESSES OPERATE OUT OF THIS INDUSTRIAL PARK. COULD BE ONE OR THE OTHER. COULD BE ALL. DO PEOPLE REALLY BELIEVE IN THAT STUFF? BUSINESS HAS BEEN GOOD. [ eerie music ] [ peaceful, ambient music ] [ all three in Hebrew ] BLESSED ARE YOU, LORD, OUR GOD [ in Hebrew ] SOVEREIGN OF THE UNIVERSE. [ in Hebrew ] WHO HAS SANCTIFIED US WITH HIS COMMANDMENTS [ in Hebrew ] AND COMMANDED US - [ in Hebrew ] TO LIGHT THE LIGHTS OF SHABBAT. Leah: SO, DID YOU GUYS GO OUT TODAY? Maya: YEAH, WE TOOK A DRIVE. FOUND A NICE PARK BY THE SCHOOL ON THE EDGE OF TOWN. HOW WAS IT? Esther: IT WAS OKAY. I DIDN'T FIND ANYBODY MY AGE. WELL, DUH. WE DIDN'T SEE ANYONE, GENIUS. NO ONE WANTS TO BE OUT IN THE COLD EXCEPT OUR LONELY BUTTS. [ Esther laughs ] THER'ES GOT TO BE SOMEWHERE WHERE THEY HANG OUT INDOORS. YEAH, THE GAS STATION, MAYBE. THERE'S NOTHING ELSE AROUND HERE. WELL, GRACE AND HER FAMILY ARE GETTING BACK TONIGHT OR TOMORROW, RIGHT? Maya: YEAH, THANK GOD. THAT'S WHERE WE NEED TO GO. LANCASTER. CAN WE? AFTER SHABBAT? NOT THIS WEEKEND, THOUGH. Leah: SORRY. I'M SORRY, I HAVE SOME THINGS I NEED TO MAKE UP FOR AT WORK. BUT YOU'VE BEEN WORKING ALL WEEK. Leah: I KNOW. THERE'S A LOT GOING ON. I HAVE TO GO IN TOMORROW NIGHT. I HAVE SOME THINGS I NEED TO TAKE CARE OF. I'LL TRY TO GET EVERYTHING DONE SO I'M OFF ON SUNDAY, BUT... Leah: NO PROMISES. WE HAVE THIS BIG CLIENT THAT MIGHT SIGN ON. AND WE'RE MEETING WITH HIM ON MONDAY. I REALLY NEED TO GO IN PREPARED. ALL THIS OVERTIME. YOUR FIRST PAYCHECK BETTER BE HUGE. Leah: IT WILL BE. AND I'LL BUY YOU GUYS WHATEVER YOU WANT. FROM THE BIG GAS STATION IN TOWN. [ girls laugh ] [ distant knock on door ] [ gasps ] [ ominous music ] [ louder knocking on door ] [ door creaks loudly ] UM, HI. BLACK EYED KID: HI. I LIVE RIGHT DOWN THE STREET. I'M LOCKED OUT OF MY HOUSE. CAN I COME IN AND USE YOUR PHONE? UM, LET ME JUST ASK MY SISTER. I'LL ONLY BE A MINUTE. IT'S SO COLD OUT. Black Eyed Kid: CAN I? OKAY, COME IN. WE DON'T HAVE A HOUSE PHONE SET UP. I'LL HAVE TO BORROW A CELL. WAIT HERE, OKAY? OKAY. EVERYTHING OKAY? YEAH, JUST... LET ME GO GET THE PHONE. [ soft knocking ] YOU KNOCK AND THEN WAIT FOR AN ANSWER, WORM. THERE'S A GIRL DOWNSTAIRS. SHE SAYS SHE'S LOCKED OUT OF HER HOUSE AND NEEDS TO USE A PHONE. WHAT THE HELL? I'M TELLING MOM YOU SAID THAT. AND I'LL TELL HER YOU LET SOMEONE IN THE HOUSE WITHOUT PERMISSION. HOW OLD IS SHE? MY AGE. WELL, IF SHE GOT LOCKED OUT OF HER HOUSE SHE WALKED A LONG WAY TO GET HERE. YOU KNOW THE FARMERS ARE THE ONLY ONES ON THE BLOCK. [ ominous music ] [ crickets ] SHE'S GONE. BUT, WHY WOULD SHE JUST LEAVE? Maya: MAYBE HER PARENTS CAME LOOKING FOR HER. MAYBE SHE'S STILL HERE. SHE KIND OF CREEPED ME OUT. SHE HAD REALLY, REALLY DARK EYES SHE WAS A KID, RIGHT? I'LL KICK THE SNOT OUT OF HER, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. WORM. I GOT YOUR BACK. CHILL. IF SHE WAS HERE, WE'D KNOW. [ eerie music ] [ feet scraping on concrete ] [ shrieks ] Esther: WAS THAT SAMANTHA? I THINK SO. WHAT'S THAT? WHAT? Maya: THAT'S SAMANTHA, ISN'T IT? YEAH, BUT WHO'S THIS OTHER GIRL? SHE WASN'T AT THE DOOR? [ doorbell ringing ] WHO'S USING THE BACK DOOR? ARE WE EXPECTING SOMEONE? NOT THAT I'M AWARE OF. EW, YOU GUYS ARE A MESS. CLEAN YOURSELVES UP, I'LL GET IT. [ Maya smacks her butt ] [ Esther laughs ] CHRIS FARMER: GOOD MORNING, I HOPE WE'RE NOT COMING OVER TOO EARLY. WE LITERALLY JUST GOT BACK AND - WELL, WE BROUGHT SOME STUFF FOR YOU. ANGELA: AND SOME COOKIES FROM ONE OF THE KOSHER MARKETS. ANGELA: THE BAG'S IN THERE. GRACE: [mouths ] HELP ME. Esther: SO, YOU'RE WALKING THE GIFT SHOPS. Esther: PROBABLY EATING ORGANIC ICE CREAM. CHECKING EVERYTHING OUT. AND YOU SEE THIS. AND YOU THINK - 'YEAH, ESTHER'. IT'S HOMEMADE. I CAN TELL. WORM, YOU ARE SUCH A BRAT. [ Grace laughs ] I KNOW. I LIKE IT, THOUGH. THANKS GRACE. YOU'RE WELCOME. AND NEXT TIME, WE NEED TO GO. JUST US. MAYA CAN DO THE DRIVING. NOT IF YOU WANT TO GET THERE IN ONE PIECE. [ Grace laughs ] SOUNDS GOOD TO ME. AND IT WAS ABOUT TIME YOU GOT BACK. WE WERE GOING A LITTLE STIR CRAZY. WE FINALLY MAKE A FRIEND HERE, AND THEN YOU'RE GONE FOR A WEEK. I KNOW, I'M SORRY. HOW ARE YOU GUYS LIKING THE HOUSE, SO FAR? Maya: IT'S NICE. I'M GETTING USED TO THE QUIET, AND... THERE'S PLENTY OF SPACE AROUND, BUT... DID YOU TALK TO THE PEOPLE WHO LIVED HERE BEFORE? Grace: WE TRIED. COOKIES AND EVERYTHING. BUT THEY WEREN'T VERY FRIENDLY. DID ANYONE DIE THERE? I KNEW IT! IT IS HAUNTED, ISN'T IT? WHAT HAVE YOU SEEN? A BLONDE GIRL. HER NAME'S SAMANTHA. THEIR DAUGHTER'S NAME WAS JULIE. SHE WAS BRUNETTE. AND I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYBODY ELSE. NO ONE ELSE HAS DIED HERE TO MY KNOWLEDGE. THEY JUST PACKED UP AND LEFT. Chris: YEAH, WE CALL THEM 'THE DEVIL FAMILY.' THE DEVLINS. [ reflective music ] THEY MOVED HERE IN MARCH AND WERE GONE BY THE NEW YEAR. WHY THE NICKNAME? LET'S JUST SAY THEY WERE A LITTLE WEIRD. NO MORE WEIRD THAN ANYONE ELSE AROUND HERE, THOUGH. Chris: COME ON NOW, EVERYONE ELSE AT LEAST TALKS TO US. WE GO OUT OF OUR WAY TO MAKE SURE THAT NEW NEIGHBORS FEEL WELCOME. THE DEVLINS? NOTHING. KEPT THEIR KID INSIDE ALL THE TIME. LITERALLY SHOOED US AWAY ANYTIME WE WOULD TRY TO COME AROUND. THEY WANTED NOTHING TO DO WITH US. DID YOU SURPRISE THEM WITH COOKIES ON A SATURDAY MORNING? [ chuckling ] Leah: JUST KIDDING. I APPRECIATE YOU GUYS HAVING ME OVER. MOST PEOPLE AROUND HERE SEEM TO REALLY KEEP TO THEMSELVES. IT IS A VERY PRIVATIVE COMMUNITY. BUT PEOPLE ARE NICE ENOUGH ONCE YOU GET TO KNOW THEM. Angela: AND AT THE VERY LEAST, THERE'S NEVER ANY TROUBLE. WE MOVED FROM A PRETTY ROUGH NEIGHBORHOOD IN PHILLY. AND IT WAS LIKE NIGHT AND DAY. BUT I WILL TAKE QUIET AND WEIRD OVER WHERE WE CAME FROM ANY DAY. IT DOES SEEM SAFE. WE LOCK OUR DOORS, ALMOST OUT OF HABIT THESE DAYS, BUT... NO ONE ELSE DOES. WELL... THEY DID FOR A WHILE AFTER THE UH.... CHRIS, DO YOU HAVE TO? IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL, BUT THERE WAS A BEAR ATTACK THE YEAR WE MOVED IN. I DIDN'T KNOW THERE WERE BEARS AROUND HERE. Chris: WELL, THERE AREN'T REALLY. Chris: A LOT OF THE NEIGHBORS LEAVE FOOD OUTSIDE THEIR HOUSE FOR... RELIGIOUS REASONS. THE SHERIFF SEEMS TO THINK THAT A LONE AND HUNGRY BEAR HAPPENED BY SMELLING THE FOOD. Chris: WELL, HE KNOCKED DOWN A DOOR AND HE MAULED A GUY TO DEATH. IT WAS PRETTY BAD. Angela: BUT THEY SHOT AN AGGRESSIVE BLACK BEAR A FEW DAYS LATER. AND IT WAS MILES FROM HERE. AND NO ONE HAS SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THAT IN THIS COUNTY EVER SINCE. IT'S SAFE TO BE OUTSIDE. GOOD TO KNOW. WE JUST DON'T LEAVE ANY FOOD OUT. Maya: THERE'S NOTHING THERE, REALLY. THEY JUST TALK ABOUT THEIR LIVES AT HOME. JULIE MENTIONS HER BROTHER BEING GONE. Maya: SAMANTHA DIDN'T HAVE ANY SIBLINGS AND SHE NEVER KNEW HER MOM. SOUNDED LIKE HER DAD HAD A DRINKING PROBLEM. JULIE WROTE ABOUT SCHOOL. Grace: YEAH. THEY WRITE LIKE THEY'RE PEN PALS AND NOT RELATIVES. MAYBE SAMANTHA DIDN'T LIVE THERE. SO, WHY IS SHE HERE NOW? HAVE YOU GUYS THOUGHT ABOUT TRYING TO CONTACT HER? I DON'T THINK SAMANTHA CAN TALK. I TRIED BUT I COULD NEVER HEAR HER VOICE. Grace: I MEAN, THERE ARE OTHER WAYS. SUCH AS? Grace: OUIJA BOARD. AUTOMATIC WRITING. GHOST APPS. LIKE ANY OF THAT STUFF WOULD WORK. EVEN IF IT DID, WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO. Grace: IT COULD WORK. Grace: BEFORE I MOVED HERE, MY FRIENDS AND I, WE DID A OUIJA BOARD ONCE. AND, YOU MADE CONTACT WITH SOMETHING? Grace: YEAH, WE DID. Grace: IT WAS... FIVE YEARS AGO. I DON'T REMEMBER EVERYTHING, AND - WE HAVEN'T DONE IT EVER AGAIN. BUT WE DEFINITELY MADE CONTACT WITH SOMEBODY. MAYA. YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO DO SEANCES. WHAT'S THE POINT OF A SEANCE, WORM? Esther: TO TALK TO SPIRITS. AND YOU HAVEN'T TRIED TO TALK TO SAMANTHA, ALREADY? THAT'S DIFFERENT. IS IT, THOUGH? YES. SOME CREEPY GHOST GIRL SHOWS UP IN MY ROOM IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. WHAT ELSE AM I SUPPOSED TO DO? I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG. LOOK, I'M NOT SAYING THAT YOU DID. BUT, SAMANTHA'S OBVIOUSLY SHOWING HERSELF TO US FOR A REASON. Maya: I THINK WE SHOULD DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO FIGURE OUT WHY. Maya: DON'T YOU? [ reflective music fades out ] [ gasps ] [ menacing music ] [ breathing heavy ] IT'S JUST A REFLECTION. [ phone rings loud ] WHOAH. EASY THERE. SORRY, JUST A BIT JUMPY. WHAT'S GOING ON LEAH? I DON'T KNOW. I THOUGHT I SAW SOMETHING OVER THERE. MY NEIGHBORS TOLD ME ABOUT THE BEAR ATTACK A FEW YEARS AGO HERE. AND THEN I KEEP THINKING ABOUT THE WEIRD STUFF IN THE WOODS. WEIRD, BUT HARMLESS. THEY'RE ALL MEANT FOR PROTECTION. AND THE BEARS... Leah: AREN'T AROUND ANYMORE, I HEARD. IF YOU'RE THIS ON EDGE, MAYBE YOU SHOULD TAKE OFF. YOU'VE HAD A LONG HARD WEEK, AND NEXT WEEK IS ONLY GOING TO BE WORSE. I KNOW. I JUST WANTED TO GET A JUMP-START WITH UBS COMING IN. Naira: YOU'LL BE FINE, TRUST ME. GO HOME TO YOUR GIRLS. HOW ARE THEY GETTING ALONG HERE? Leah: THEY'RE DOING OKAY. THEY COULD PROBABLY BENEFIT FROM ME BEING AROUND MORE. DEFINITELY. YOU ALL NEED THAT. ESPECIALLY AFTER THE TRAGEDY YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH, WHICH... WHAT? Leah: I KNOW ORTHODOX COMMUNITIES ARE VERY TIGHT KNIT. SO... I'M GLAD YOU CAME, TRUST ME. [ emotional music ] BUT MOST PEOPLE DEPEND ON THEIR COMMUNITIES WHEN THE WORST HAPPENS. YET, YOU... LEFT ALL THAT AND FOUND YOUR WAY HERE WHERE YOU... BASICALLY KNEW NO ONE. Naira: EXCEPT A DISTANT BROTHER. Naira: WE ALL GRIEVE DIFFERENTLY. AND IT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS. BUT I'M JUST CURIOUS. WHY... I - I WANT TO FINISH UP A FEW NUMBERS AND GET HOME TO THE GIRLS. WE CAN TALK SOME OTHER TIME, THOUGH. OKAY. LUNCH TOMORROW? MY TREAT. NOT UNLESS THERE'S A KOSHER PLACE NEARBY THAT I DON'T KNOW ABOUT. JUST BRING YOUR PACKED LUNCH LIKE YOU DO HERE. AND I GUESS I'LL HAVE TO TREAT YOU TO MY DAZZLING PERSONALITY- -AND SOME COFFEE. YOU CAN DO THAT, RIGHT? MIGHT HAVE TO BRING MY OWN MUG? Naira: FINE. YOU IN? PLEASE? OKAY. YEAH. SOUNDS GOOD. [ emotional music fades ] Maya: OKAY, THANKS DENISE. WE'LL LET YOU KNOW. SHE DIDN'T WANT TO TALK TOO MUCH, BUT... SHE DID SAY NO ONE ELSE EVER LIVED WITH THE DEVLINS TO HER KNOWLEDGE. I FIGURED. AND OTHER THAN AN ELDERLY MAN NO ONE'S DIED HERE EITHER. SO MAYBE SAMANTHA FOLLOWED THEM FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE? MAYBE. YOU FIND THE ADDRESSES? Grace: YEAH. THEY LIVED IN OHIO. THEY'RE IN DELAWARE NOW. BUT THEY LIVED IN SELAH FOR 15 YEARS BEFORE THEY CAME HERE. AND THEY HAD A SON WHO JUST DISAPPEARED. HERE. ANDREW DISAPPEARED ON DECEMBER 24TH SOMETIME BETWEEN- 11PM AND 7AM. LOTS OF PEOPLE GO MISSING AROUND THERE, APPARENTLY. MOSTLY KIDS. RUNAWAYS AND STUFF. WHY? Grace: THEY'RE LIKE A CULT. THE ENTIRE TOWN. Grace: THEY... KEEP TO THEMSELVES AND THEY'RE JUST WEIRD. NO WONDER PEOPLE RUN FOR IT. YOU READY? [ door closes ] Esther: HI MOM. Leah: HEY SWEETIE. YOU OKAY? YEAH, YEAH I'M JUST TIRED. IT WAS A LONG DAY. YEAH, YOU WORKED LIKE FOUR HOURS. I MEANT THE WHOLE DAY. THAT'S WHAT YOU GET FOR WORKING AFTER SHABBAT INSTEAD OF SPENDING TIME WITH ME. I PROMISE, I WON'T MAKE A HABIT OF IT. DOES THAT MEAN YOU'LL BE HOME TOMORROW? Leah: NO. ESTHER, IT'S NOT GOING TO BE LIKE THIS FOREVER. THERE'S A LOT GOING ON AT WORK FOR ME RIGHT NOW. THE HOLIDAYS. NEW CLIENTS. BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO LAST. I KNOW. BUT IT DOESN'T MAKE IT ANY EASIER NOW. WHEN YOU SAID WE WERE MOVING HERE I AT LEAST EXPECTED TO HAVE SOME TIME WITH YOU. COME HERE. JUST, TWO MORE WEEKS OKAY? THEN IT'S GOING TO START SLOWING DOWN. Leah: AFTER THE NEW YEAR WE CAN GET YOU SETTLED INTO SCHOOL. Leah: YOU'LL MEET SOME PEOPLE. [ tender, emotional music ] RIGHT NOW. THIS IS WHAT MOMMY NEEDS. THAT'S SO SELFISH. I'M REALLY SORRY. I PROMISE, I'LL MAKE IT UP TO YOU, OKAY? DON'T. DO WHAT YOU NEED TO. I UNDERSTAND. YOU LOST YOUR FATHER. IT'S NOT ALL ABOUT ME. HE WAS YOUR HUSBAND. YOU KNEW HIM LONGER. PLUS YOU HAVE A LOT MORE THINGS TO WORRY ABOUT THAN I DO. LIKE TAKING CARE OF US. ALTHOUGH I DO WANT TO GO FOR ICE CREAM SOON. MAYBE WE CAN MAKE THAT HAPPEN AND CALL IT EVEN. DEAL. SO, WE START WITH IT ON THE LETTER 'G' AND WE BOTH HAVE TO BE TOUCHING IT. WHY THE LETTER 'G'? I DON'T KNOW. SAMANTHA. YOU'VE SHOWN YOURSELF AND ESTHER AND MAYA, NOW. THERE HAS TO BE SOMETHING YOU WANT TO TELL THEM. SOMETHING YOU'RE TRYING TO COMMUNICATE. Grace: ARE YOU THERE? DO YOU WANT OUR HELP? IS THERE ANYONE THERE? WE WANT TO HELP YOU, IF WE CAN. WE WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU. Grace: PLEASE? [ unsettling music ] THIS IS SAMANTHA. THIS IS SAMANTHA. OH, YOU BEOTCH. [ Maya laughing ] YOU SHOULD'VE SEEN THE LOOK ON YOUR FACE. YOU WERE SO EXCITED. 'THIS IS SAMANTHA. THIS IS SAMANTHA.' SCREW YOU! NO ONE ELSE WAS ANSWERING. YEAH, I GUESS WE SHOULD CALL IT QUITS. Maya: WE CAN ALWAYS TRY AGAIN AT LIKE MIDNIGHT OR SOMETHING. IS THERE A REASON YOUR BUTT'S IN MY FACE? Maya: YOU OKAY? MAYA? MAYA LOOK. PLEASE TELL ME YOU WROTE THIS BEHIND YOUR BACK WHEN I WASN'T LOOKING. Grace: I DIDN'T. [ eerie music ] YOU'RE DREAMING. GET UP. RIGHT NOW. Esther: WHAT? ESTHER. YOU NEED TO WAKE UP. IT'S IN THE ROOM WITH YOU. [ coughing ] [ feet landing in dust ] WORM? ESTHER! WHAT? Maya: WHAT HAPPENED? WHY ARE YOU ON THE FLOOR? WHAT? WHAT IS THIS STUFF? Esther: I DON'T KNOW. I'M TIRED. OKAY, WELL WE NEED TO CLEAN THIS UP RIGHT NOW. THEN YOU CAN GO BACK TO SLEEP. FINE. GO IN THE BATHROOM. I'LL BE RIGHT THERE. Naira: MOFONGO WITH SHRIMP. A SIDE OF SWEET POTATO FRIES. Naira: AND A BOWL OF FRENCH ONION SOUP. [ elevator music ] THAT SHRIMP ALONE IS ALMOST $30. Naira: I'M DOING YOU A FAVOR. DO YOU WANT MANDY TO SPIT IN YOUR COFFEE? THE TIP FROM OUR DRINKS ALONE AIN'T GOING TO HELP HER. 'MISSUS KOSHER'. YOURS WILL... YOU DRUNK. [ Naira laughs ] Naira: SPEAKING OF DRUNK, I BETTER GET TO WORK ON THAT. I WANT CARL TO BELIEVE ME WHEN I TELL HIM I HAVE HEADACHE AND NEED REST. MORALES: I HOPE YOU'RE NOT DRIVING AFTER THAT, MRS. GRANT. NOT A CHANCE. I BROUGHT A DESIGNATED DRIVER. MEET, LEAH BLOOMFIELD. BLOOMFIELD. YOU MOVED UP TO THE PLACE ON GREEN GROVE A COUPLE WEEKS AGO. YES. NICE TO MEET YOU, SIR. SHERIFF. JOSE MORALES. ORTHODOX JEWISH FAMILY. YES SIR. WAIT, I THOUGHT THAT WAS A RUMOR, I MEAN... YOU'RE NOT... WEARING A... WIG? Morales: YEAH. [ laughs ] WIG. Leah: WE ONLY WEAR THOSE WHEN WE'RE MARRIED. MOST OF THE TIME. Morales: NOTED. WELL, IN ANY EVENT... WELCOME TO THE COUNTY. I HOPE THEY'RE TREATING YOU GOOD AROUND HERE. SOME PEOPLE AROUND HERE TEND TO BE A LITTLE BIT UM... PARTICULAR. BUT... BUT HARMLESS. I'VE SEEN SOME OF THAT. Morales: YEAH... NAIRA'S HUSBAND HELPED ME NAVIGATE HOW THEY DO THINGS AROUND HERE. Morales: WHAT PEOPLE BELIEVE AND UH... Morales: HOW NOT TO STEP ON ANYONE'S TOES. HE WAS A GOOD MAN. AND SMART. THAT HE WAS. YOU NEED TO LOOK OUT FOR THIS ONE. OH TOO LATE. I ALREADY HAVE MY HOOKS IN HER. [ Morales chuckles ] HAVE A GREAT DAY LADIES. NICE TO MEET YOU LEAH. YOU TOO, SHERIFF. I TALKED TO A RABBI A YEAR AGO ABOUT THE OCCULT. NOT EVERYONE IN OUR COMMUNITY REALLY BELIEVES IN THAT STUFF, BUT... Maya: HE TOLD ME THERE WERE A LOT OF WAYS THAT - PEOPLE WOULD TRY TO COMMUNICATE WITH SPIRITS. ONE OF THEM WAS... THEY WOULD TAKE A BLACK CAT'S ASHES AND DRAW A CIRCLE AROUND THEIR BED. AND RUB THEM ON THEIR EYES. IT WOULD GIVE THEM THE ABILITY TO SEE SPIRITS. WHY THE HELL WOULD ANYONE WANT TO DO THAT? YOU WOULDN'T. UNLESS YOU'RE A MYSTIC, OR... TRYING TO PERFORM AN EXORCISM. LIKE... YOU HAD TO SEE THEM TO KNOW WHAT YOU WERE DEALING WITH. MAYBE IT WAS THAT BLACK EYED KID. SHE COULD'VE BEEN SOME SORT OF A WITCH. ESTHER'S BEEN SEEING A GHOST GIRL SINCE WE MOVED IN. I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS AN ACTUAL KID. YEAH, ALL WE KNOW FOR SURE RIGHT NOW IS THAT SAMANTHA WAS HERE. Grace: STILL IS, APPARENTLY. RIGHT. HOPEFULLY THE DEVLINS CAN TELL ME SOMETHING. YOU SURE YOU DON'T JUST WANT TO CALL? DELAWARE'S A LONG WAY. HARDER TO IGNORE SOMEONE STANDING RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU. AND... IF THIS IS ALL CONNECTED SOMEHOW THEN... Maya: SOMETHING DID THAT TO ESTHER LAST NIGHT. I NEED TO FIGURE THIS OUT BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE HAPPENS. Leah: SOUNDS LIKE YOUR HUSBAND MADE... Leah: QUITE AN IMPACT HERE. HE WAS INFLUENTIAL. WE WERE A LOT ALIKE. SO... [ cheerful background music ] YOU EITHER LOVED HIM OR HATED HIM. MOST LOVED. Naira: YOU SAID BEFORE THAT JACOB WAS YOUR RABBI'S NEPHEW? MUST'VE BEEN SIMILAR. NOT REALLY. EVERYONE LOVED HIM. AND YOU? Leah: I LIKED HIM AS A PERSON. AND A FATHER. THAT WAS IT. HE CHEATED ON YOU. MANY TIMES. Leah: WASN'T STOPPING EITHER. HE WANTED TO LIVE THIS DOUBLE LIFE. SO THAT WE COULD SAVE FACE IN THE COMMUNITY. UNTIL THE GIRLS WERE GROWN. AND THEN WE COULD OFFICIALLY GO OUR SEPARATE WAYS. Leah: I WAS SECONDS AWAY FROM CALLING HIM TO GO THROUGH WITH THE DIVORCE. WHEN THE PHONE RANG. IN MY HAND. AND THEY TOLD ME ABOUT THE ACCIDENT. Leah: AND THAT HE DIDN'T MAKE IT. I DIDN'T WANT TO DRAG HIS NAME THROUGH THE MUD. OR HAVE THE GIRLS LOOK AT HIM ANY DIFFERENTLY. SO, I JUST KEPT QUIET. ABOUT EVERYTHING. BUT I COULDN'T STAY THERE. I FELT LIKE AS MUCH OF A HYPOCRITE AS HE WAS. YOU KNOW? AND... I'M THE FIRST AND ONLY PERSON YOU'VE TOLD? YEAH. THIS KIND OF THING DOESN'T HAPPEN WHERE WE COME FROM. I DIDN'T WANT THE NEGATIVE ATTENTION. ESPECIALLY NOT FOR THE GIRLS. HONEY, IF THAT HAD HAPPENED TO ME- I WOULD'VE BLASTED HIM ON EVERY TELEPHONE POLE IN THE COUNTY. TAKEN OUT ADS IN THE PAPER. Naira: TWEETED IT WITH A MILLION HASHTAGS. YOU WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN WRONG TO LET THE TRUTH COME OUT. BUT... I UNDERSTAND WHY YOU DIDN'T. AND IT'S INCREDIBLY SELFLESS. Naira: AND BRAVE. THANK YOU, NAIRA. IT FELT GOOD TO GET IT OFF MY CHEST. WELL, THAT'S WHAT I'M HERE FOR. ANYTHING YOU NEED. ANYTHING. Grace: HEY MAYA, WHAT'S UP? Maya: NOTHING, JUST... WAITING FOR MRS. DEVLIN TO GET OFF WORK. I'M IN THE PARKING LOT RIGHT NOW. Grace: UM, HOW DO YOU KNOW WHERE SHE WORKS? FACEBOOK. PEOPLE POST EVERYTHING THERE. Grace: STALKER. WHATEVER. HOW'S ESTHER? Grace: SHE'S FINE. SHE'S SLEEPING. Grace: UM, DIDN'T YOU SAY THIS MORNING THAT YOU FOUND ASHES- Grace: IN HER BEDROOM? >>YEAH. Grace: I WAS TAKING OUT THE TRASH AND I SAW ASHES ON THE GROUND. Grace: LIKE A TRAIL TOWARDS THE WOODS. REALLY? Grace: YEAH, I WANT TO FIND OUT WHERE THEY GO. ALONE? ARE YOU CRAZY? Grace: I SAW A MACHETE IN YOUR BASEMENT. I MIGHT TAKE IT WITH ME. [ mysterious, tribal music ] Maya: OKAY, JUST... BE CAREFUL. KEEP ME POSTED. >>Grace: I WILL. [ mysterious tribal music continues ] [ machete cutting through brush ] JAMIE DEVLIN: HI, CAN I HELP YOU? HI, ARE YOU JAMIE DEVLIN? DEPENDS. ON WHO WANTS TO KNOW. I'M MAYA BLOOMFIELD, I JUST... Maya: MOVED INTO YOUR OLD PLACE IN LITTLE MEADOWS. LITTLE MEADOWS. WE ONLY LIVED THERE A SHORT WHILE. MAYBE A YEAR. IF THE FURNACE WENT, IT WAS AFTER WE LEFT. I PROMISE. IT'S FINE, THEY REPLACED IT BEFORE WE MOVED IN, BUT... DID YOU KNOW ANYONE NAMED SAMANTHA WHEN YOU LIVED THERE? [ ominous music ] WE FOUND THINGS. LETTERS, DRAWINGS BETWEEN HER JULIE. JULIE HAD PROBLEMS. Jamie: PROBLEMS WE TOOK CARE OF. THERE WAS NO SAMANTHA. EXCUSE ME. [ eerie, mystical music ] ESTHER? ESTHER. ANSWER ME! ESTHER, HONEY. CAN YOU HEAR ME? Esther: MOMMY, I'M STUCK. HONEY, WHERE? Esther: I THINK I STEPPED IN THORNS. I CAN'T TELL. Esther: WHEN I TRY TO PULL AWAY IT HURTS. CAN YOU SEE THIS? Esther: YOU'RE FAR. WHICH WAY, BABY? Esther: A LITTLE TO THE LEFT. [ unsettling, dark music ] Esther: YOU'RE GETTING CLOSER. I CAN'T SEE YOU YET. Esther: [ playfully ] BUT I CAN SEE YOU. Esther: COME ON, MOMMY. Esther: ALMOST THERE. Esther: MOMMY. Esther: CAN YOU SEE ME NOW? [ bones cracking ] [ Leah screams ] YEAH. SHE'S RIGHT HERE. EVERYTHING'S GOOD. OKAY. YEAH, NO PROBLEM. SEE YOU SOON. I'M MAKING DINNER TONIGHT. MOM WANTS YOU TO SET THE TABLE. IS EVERYTHING OKAY? SHE SAID SHE'S TIRED FROM WORK BUT... I DON'T KNOW. Maya: SHE DIDN'T SOUND GOOD. YOU SAID SHE'S BEEN HAVING NIGHTMARES, RIGHT? Esther: EVERY NIGHT SINCE WE MOVED IN. ANY IDEA WHAT THEY'RE ABOUT? SHE WON'T TELL ME. Maya: ME EITHER. WELL, ALL OF THIS HAS TO BE CONNECTED SOMEHOW, RIGHT? ANDREW. SAMANTHA. MRS. DEVLIN LYING ABOUT HER. SHE MIGHT NOT HAVE KNOWN. MY MOM KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT SAMAMTHA. MAYBE THEY THINK JULIE MADE IT UP. SHE'S NOT MAKING IT UP. I KNOW. WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT. GO SET THE TABLE. FINE. ESTHER. IT... IT... IT'S NOTHING. THE HELL WAS THAT ABOUT? I DON'T KNOW, SHE'S BEEN LIKE THAT ALL DAY. LOOKING AT STUFF THAT'S NOT THERE. NOT LOOKING UP. IT'S KIND OF... SCARY. [ discordant music ] [ menacing music ] NO, NO, NO. PLEASE. PLEASE LET ME GO. PLEASE LET ME GO. I WANT TO GO HOME. I WANT TO GO HOME, PLEASE! [ screaming ] [ gasping for air ] I WAKE YOU GUYS UP AGAIN? I'M SORRY. YOU WANT TO TELL US WHAT YOU'RE DREAMING ABOUT? ESPECIALLY SINCE YOU WAKE US EVERY NIGHT. Esther: I THINK YOU OWE US. WE NEED TO TELL YOU SOME THINGS. Maya: SAMANTHA WROTE DOWN EVERYTHING SHE HEARD FROM THE DEVLINS. YOU KNOW MOLECH? YOU SHALL NOT LET ANY OF YOUR DESCENDANTS... PASS THROUGH THE FIRE TO MOLECH. A PAGAN IDOL, RIGHT? THEY WOULD OFFER THEIR OWN CHILDREN TO HIM BY FIRE. RIGHT. SOME WORSHIPERS BELIEVED... IF YOU DIDN'T GIVE YOUR CHILDREN WILLINGLY ONCE THEY WERE CHOSEN, ONE OF MOLECH'S ANGELS, BALAC OR THERESZA, WOULD COME AND TAKE THEM THEMSELVES TO BURN. THEY'D APPEAL TO TREE GODS FOR PROTECTION. MAKE OFFERINGS AT THE BOTTOM OF TREES. DECORATE THEM. ALL THAT. THEY'D EVEN KEEP A FIRE GOING THROUGH THE NIGHT IN FRONT OF THEIR TENTS. TO WARD OFF MOLECH'S ANGELS. SOUNDS LIKE CHRISTMAS. Maya: IT DOES. A DARK VERSION. SAMANTHA SAID THE DEVLINS AND EVERYONE WHO LIVED IN SELAH BELIEVED IT. SAID IT... CAME FROM THE NATIVES OR SOMETHING. THE DEMONS WOULD COME BACK THE NEXT NIGHT AND... SPRINKLE THE ASHES OF ALL THE CHILDREN IN THE HOUSE- OKAY. I'VE HEARD ENOUGH. I THINK ESTHER HAS, TOO. Esther: I ALREADY HEARD IT ALL, I'M GOOD. WHY, YOU SCARED BRO? YOU'RE SUCH A TWERP. [ Esther laughs ] MAYBE I AM A LITTLE SCARED. WHY DIDN'T YOU GUYS COME TO ME SOONER? ABOUT SAMANTHA? OR ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE? WOULD YOU HAVE BELIEVED US? YEAH, I THINK SO. EVEN IF I WASN'T EXPERIENCING THINGS FOR MYSELF, I TRUST YOU GIRLS. I HOPE YOU TRUST ME, TOO. WE DO. GOOD. SO FROM NOW ON, NO MORE SECRETS. WE FIGURE EVERYTHING OUT TOGETHER. DOES THAT GO FOR YOUR DREAMS, TOO? NOT NOW. LET'S ALL JUST SETTLE DOWN AND TRY TO GET SOME SLEEP. [ melancholy piano music ] [ loud knocking ] CHRIS? ARE YOU OKAY IN THERE? IS EVERYONE OKAY? YEAH, WHAT'S GOING ON? >>Chris: ARE YOU SURE? Chris: I WOKE UP AND ANGELA WASN'T THERE. I THOUGHT SHE HAD JUST GONE TO THE BATHROOM, BUT WHEN I CHECKED SHE WAS GONE. AND THEN I CAME OUT AND.... GET BACK INSIDE, I'M CALLING THE POLICE. CHRIS, WHAT? GET BACK INSIDE, MAYA, NOW! [ steps in something wet ] [ foreboding music ] DID YOU SEE OR HEAR ANYTHING BETWEEN LAST NIGHT AND THIS MORNING? ANYTHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY? IT WAS QUIET UNTIL CHRIS CAME OVER. Morales: YOU'RE NEW TO TOWN BUT YOU'VE ALREADY MET THE FAMILY? YEAH. WE HANG OUT WITH GRACE ALL THE TIME. I MET HER PARENTS A COUPLE TIMES. THEY SEEMED NICE. GOT ALONG WELL. Maya: I DIDN'T NOTICE ANYTHING WRONG. THAT WOULD'VE BEEN MY NEXT QUESTION. CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED? YEAH. CHRIS CALLED. SAID ANGELA WASN'T IN BED THIS MORNING WHEN HE WOKE UP. Morales: FRONT DOOR WAS OPEN BUT SHE WAS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND. SO UH, HE WENT LOOKING DOWN THE STREET AND UH, THAT'S WHEN HE SAW WHAT WAS AT YOUR DOOR. AND GRACE? Morales: FAST ASLEEP UNTIL I WOKE HER UP TO QUESTION HER. Maya: IS THAT BLOOD? OUTSIDE? LOOKS LIKE IT. WE'VE ALREADY SENT IT TO THE LAB TO BE EXAMINED. SEE IF IT BELONGS TO ANGELA OR ANYONE ELSE IN THE DATABASE. Morales: FOR THAT MATTER. DO YOU THINK IT'S A WARNING? LIKE, A THREAT? I WOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT THAT YET, I MEAN, I KNOW IT LOOKS SCARY. BUT THESE TWO THINGS COULD BE COMPLETELY UNRELATED. Morales: IT'S POSSIBLE THAT ANGELA LEFT ON HER OWN VOLITION LAST NIGHT, AND THIS... THAT LOOKS FRESH. THE BLOOD WAS ON THE DOORPOSTS AND THE LINTEL LIKE... SOMEONE WAS MOCKING THE PASSOVER. YEAH, I NOTICED. IT COULD BE ANTI-SEMITIC. Morales: OR IT COULD JUST BE SOME SORT OF PROTECTIVE RITUAL OR SOMETHING. I MEAN, WE JUST DON'T KNOW. [ sighs ] DOES 'THREE NIGHTS' MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU? I TALKED TO YOUR MOTHER AND SHE SAID THAT SHE DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING, BUT- Morales: WE'LL BE IN TOUCH. BUT I HAVE TO BE HONEST WITH YOU. WE HAVE TWO DEPUTIES, DETECTIVE SHAEFER FROM ONE COUNTY OVER, AND A HANDFUL OF DEPUTIZED CITIZENS. THIS MIGHT TAKE A WHILE. BUT, EITHER THEY OR I ARE GOING TO KEEP AN EYE ON THIS PLACE FOR A WHILE. OKAY. Morales: LOOK, BETWEEN YOU AND I, Morales: ANGELA'S CELLPHONE WAS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND. THERE WAS NO SIGN OF A STRUGGLE. AND NO ONE HEARD ANYTHING LAST NIGHT. IT'S POSSIBLE THAT SHE LEFT ON HER OWN POWER. Morales: WHICH COULD MEAN... ANYTHING. I WOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT ANYTHING YET. THANK YOU, SHERIFF. MA'AM. THREE NIGHTS. YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THAT MEANS? I HOPE NOT. SOMETHING TO DO WITH YOUR DREAMS? I'VE BEEN SEEING WHAT SAMANTHA DESCRIBED. A DEMON CARRYING A CHILD INTO FIRE. Leah: LAST NIGHT I SAW IT CARRYING ESTHER. I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S JUST MY SUBCONSCIOUS MIXING THINGS UP. WHAT IF IT'S NOT? I HAVEN'T SEEN MUCH SINCE WE'VE BEEN OUT HERE. I HAVE THAT EFFECT ON PEOPLE. HARD TO LOOK AWAY WHEN THIS IS STANDING RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU. [ both laughing ] DON'T TELL ANYONE I SAID THIS, BUT MY MOM SAYS YOU ARE VERY PRETTY. AND VERY RICH. I'M A HOUSEHOLD NAME. >>Esther: M-HM. SURE ARE. [ melancholy music ] Esther: SHE LEFT ALL HER FRIENDS BEHIND WHEN WE MOVED. BUT I THINK IT'S NICE FOR HER TO HAVE SOMEONE TO TALK TO. BESIDES US. Naira: ME TOO. HEY. Maya: JULIE DEVLIN. JULIE: I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO TALK TO STRANGERS. Maya: I JUST MOVED INTO YOUR OLD HOUSE IN LITTLE MEADOWS. CAN YOU TELL ME ANYTHING ABOUT SAMANTHA? SHE'S NOT REAL. I WAS SICK WHEN I LIVED THERE. Maya: WE'VE SEEN HER. SHE'S THE ONE WHO DREW YOU THIS PICTURE, RIGHT? Julie: MY PARENTS TOLD ME THAT SHE WAS AN IMAGINARY FRIEND. THEY MADE ME PROMISE NOT TO TALK ABOUT HER WITH ANYONE ELSE. Julie: THEY SAID PEOPLE WOULD THINK I WAS CRAZY. IT ALL FELT SO REAL. BUT THEY NEVER LIED TO ME BEFORE. SO, I BELIEVED THEM. HOW DID YOU MEET HER? THEY TOLD ME NOT TO GO INTO THE BASEMENT. THEY DIDN'T GIVE ME AN EXPLANATION. THEY JUST SAID IT WASN'T SAFE. Julie: I WENT TO SEE, AND I NOTICED A PILE OF STUFF IN FRONT OF THE DOOR. Julie: IT HADN'T BEEN THERE BEFORE. [ eerie music ] [ door hits wall ] [ muffled talking ] SAMANTHA: [ muffled ] IT'S OKAY. IT'S OKAY. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? [ moaning ] [ emotional music ] WHO ARE YOU? [ moans ] YOU WANT A PENCIL? M-HM. PAPER? M-HM! Julie: SHE SAID MY PARENTS WERE KEEPING HER THERE TO PROTECT HER. Julie: FROM SOMETHING. Julie: I DON'T REMEMBER WHAT SHE CALLED IT BUT THERE WAS A MONSTER. Julie: OR A DEMON. Julie: SHE'D SEEN IT. HEARD IT. THEY KEPT HER TIED UP IN THE BASEMENT ALL DAY TO PROTECT HER? Julie: NO, ONLY AT NIGHT TO KEEP HER FROM MAKING NOISE. AT FIRST. DURING THE DAY THEY WOULD TAKE THE TAPE OFF SO SHE COULD EAT. THEY JUST WOULDN'T LET HER NEAR ANY OF THE WINDOWS UPSTAIRS. AND WHENEVER I CAME HOME FROM SCHOOL THEY PUT HER BACK. Julie: ONCE THEY FIGURED OUT WE HAD SEEN EACH OTHER, Julie: I WAS ONLY ALLOWED TO GO DOWN THERE ONCE IN A WHILE. Julie: SO WE STARTED PASSING LETTERS. UNTIL THEY COULD TRUST HER ENOUGH NOT TO MAKE NOISE. AND THAT'S WHEN... [ somber music ] YOU'RE LEAVING? BUT... WHAT ABOUT THE... THE MONSTER? SOMETHING TERRIBLE MIGHT'VE HAPPENED TO ANDREW. Samantha: I NEED TO GO FIND OUT. BEFORE IT HAPPENS TO YOU, TOO. HE RAN AWAY. Samantha: I HOPE SO. BUT I'VE HEARD THEM TALKING SINCE THEY GOT ME. WHAT DID THEY SAY? THINGS YOU DON'T NEED TO HEAR. TRUST ME, JULIE. HOW IS LEAVING GOING TO HELP? CAN'T I COME WITH YOU? NO. I NEED TO DO THIS MYSELF. AND I'M NOT RISKING SOMETHING HAPPENING TO YOU. NEVER. I'LL BE OKAY. YOU GO BACK TO SLEEP. IF I DON'T COME BACK, I DON'T WANT THEM BLAMING YOU. Samantha: I'LL BREAK THE CANDLE. Samantha: THEY'LL THINK I USED A PIECE OF IT TO ESCAPE. Samantha: AND I WANT YOU TO BRING THE LETTERS TO ME. THE ONES YOU SAVED. IF YOU DON'T COME BACK? WHY GO OUT THERE IF YOU THINK YOU MIGHT GET HURT? I SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID THAT. I WILL COME BACK. OKAY? Samantha: COME HERE. I'LL COME BACK. Julie: THAT WAS THE LAST TIME I SAW HER. Julie: THE NEXT COUPLE OF NIGHTS, SHE WASN'T THERE. Julie: I BROKE DOWN AFTER A FEW DAYS. Julie: I TOLD MY PARENTS THAT I HAD BEEN TALKING TO HER. Julie: THEY TRIED TO CONVINCE ME THAT IT WAS JUST MY IMAGINATION. Julie: THEY TOOK EVERYTHING OUT OF THE CRAWLSPACE. I COULDN'T FIND ONE LETTER. SHE WAS JUST... GONE. THEY WERE HIDDEN. IN A CRACK IN THE WALL. THE LETTERS. WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENED TO HER? I DON'T KNOW. I WISH I KNEW. MAYBE IT GOT HER AFTER ALL. [ somber music fades ] THERE WAS ONE NIGHT. A WEEK LATER. [ melancholy piano music ] [ eerie piano music ] SAMANTHA? Julie: I THOUGHT THAT WHATEVER IT WAS THAT TOOK HER CAME BACK. [ sad piano music ] JUST TO TELL ME IT HAD WON. TO TAUNT ME. Julie: IT MADE IT EASIER TO BELIEVE THAT I MADE IT ALL UP. Julie: IF I BELIEVED SAMANTHA WAS REAL. Julie: THEN I'D HAVE TO ACCEPT - THAT THAT THING WAS, TOO. AND THAT... MAYBE MY BROTHER DIDN'T JUST RUN AWAY. Julie: IF YOU FIND HER. IF SHE IS STILL ALIVE. WILL YOU TELL ME? OF COURSE I WILL. THANK YOU, JULIE. Naira: MORE THAN LIKELY THEY WERE PROTECTING SAMANTHA. FROM MOLECH? ONE OF HIS SERVANTS. BUT NOT THE DEMONS. EVERYTHING YOU AND THE GIRLS HAVE EXPERIENCED. THE MONSTER YOU SAW IN THE WOODS. THE GIRL ESTHER LET INTO THE HOUSE. IT SOUNDS LIKE A SKINWALKER. A NATIVE AMERICAN WITCH. THEY CAN DISGUISE THEMSELVES AS DIFFERENT ANIMALS, PEOPLE... LIVING OR DEAD... AS WELL AS OTHER THINGS. YOU BECAME ONE BY MURDERING SOMEONE YOU TRULY LOVED. MOST THINK IT'S JUST FOLKLORE. BUT IF YOU LIVED IN A NATIVE AREA, YOU'D KNOW IT WASN'T. IN EGYPT, WHEN MOSES CONFRONTED THEM, PHARAOH'S SORCERERS WERE ABLE TO PERFORM MIRACLES. WATER INTO BLOOD. RODS INTO SERPENTS. Naira: THERE ARE DARK POWERS. THEY MAY NOT MATCH GOD'S BUT THEY EXIST. WHAT DOES IT WANT FROM US? Naira: CONSIDERING EVERYTHING YOU'VE TOLD ME... Naira: I THINK IT WANTS YOU TO SHOW RESPECT TO MOLECH. THAT'S WHAT THEY DO IN SELAH NOW. KEEP A FIRE BURNING THROUGH THE NIGHT. PUT UP LIGHTS TO DETER THE DARKNESS. YOU KNOW I CAN'T DO ANY OF THAT. I'M NOT SURE THERE'S ANY OTHER WAY. YOUR NIGHTMARES HAVE BEEN SHOWING YOU EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN- -IF IT DOESN'T GET WHAT IT WANTS. WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENED TO JULIE DEVLIN'S OLDER BROTHER? OR SAMANTHA? I WANT YOU TO THINK LONG AND HARD ABOUT IT. MY HUSBAND... ALEX. STUDIED THE LOCAL RELIGIONS. HE PARTOOK IN RITUALS, SEANCES, MEDITATIONS, YOU NAME IT. HE DIDN'T BELIEVE IN ANY OF IT BUT HE FOUND IT ALL FASCINATING. BUT ONE DAY, HE GOT TOO CLOSE. DISRESPECTED THE WRONG PERSON. AND THEY CURSED HIM. GAVE HIM THREE NIGHTS TO LIVE. HE DIDN'T TAKE IT SERIOUSLY, AND NEITHER DID I. BUT ON THE FOURTH MORNING, I WOKE UP. AND HE WAS... GONE. COLD AND RIGID. DEAD FOR HOURS. THEY SAID IT WAS A HEART ATTACK. DESPITE HIM BEING A COMPLETELY HEALTHY MAN. I STILL REMEMBER THE LOOK ON HIS FACE. IF IT WAS A HEART ATTACK... SOMETHING SCARED HIM TO DEATH. [ police radio chatter ] [ high pitched scream ] [ deep, demonic grunts ] [ branch rustling ] Morales: MRS. FARMER? [ eerie, electronic music ] IF YOU'RE THERE, YOU NEED TO COME OUT RIGHT NOW! I'M NOT GOING TO TELL YOU AGAIN! [ demonic grunt ] [ Gun Shooting ] [ Gun Shooting repeated ] [ Morales breathing heavy ] [ tense music ] Angela's Voice: NO NO NO. PLEASE DON'T KILL ME. NO PLEASE! PLEASE! [ Angela crying and screaming ] Morales' Voice: I'M NOT GOING TO TELL YOU AGAIN. [ gun shooting over and over ] [ gun shooting faster ] [ skinwalker screams ] Morales' Voice [ staticy ]: I'M NOT GOING TO TELL YOU AGAIN. [ crickets fade in ] [ dissonant electronic music ] SHERIFF, WE HEARD GUNSHOTS. IS EVERYTHING OKAY? I.. I UH.. I THOUGHT I SAW SOMEBODY. I FOLLOWED THEM. AND? AND A BUNCH OF DEER CAME UP BEHIND ME. Morales: IT STARTLED ME SO I SHOT A COUPLE TIMES. IT WAS STUPID. YOU KNOW WHAT? LOOK, GET INSIDE. ETHAN OR SOMEONE WILL BE HERE SOON. Morales: UM... EVERYTHING'S OKAY. SORRY FOR THE SCARE. [ mysterious, ethereal music ] [ screeching, branches snapping ] [ jarring, tense music ] [ Samantha screams ] Jamie: IT'S THE ONLY WAY. Jamie: IT'S THE ONLY WAY! [ dissonant music ] [ melancholy music ] [ crying ] WHY ARE YOU CRYING? I'M JUST REALLY TIRED OF THESE DREAMS. LAY BACK DOWN. IT'S OVER NOW, RIGHT? SO, THINK OF SOMETHING DIFFERENT. TORAH VERSES, OR... A HAPPY MEMORY LIKE THE LAST TIME WE WENT TO THE BEACH. THAT'S WHAT YOU ALWAYS USED TO TELL ME WHEN I HAD BAD DREAMS. YOU REMEMBER? I DO. DID IT WORK? EVERY TIME. Morales: I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. I HAVEN'T TOLD SHAEFER OR ANYONE ELSE. Naira: WHY NOT? BECAUSE I'M SCARED. EITHER I'M GOING CRAZY OR... WHATEVER THIS IS, IT'S BEYOND MY ABILITY TO DEAL WITH IT. I MEAN... I WISH I COULD JUST FORGET ABOUT IT. Naira: HONESTLY, LISTENING TO THAT INSTINCT WOULD BE MY FIRST RECOMMENDATION. Naira: I THINK THIS WITCH WANTS SOMETHING SPECIFIC FROM LEAH. Naira: IF SHE GIVES IT, THEN EVERYTHING WILL LIKELY FALL INTO PLACE. I CAN'T. I - I CAN'T. I MEAN... ANGELA FARMER'S MISSING AND THIS PERSON MAY HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT. Naira: I UNDERSTAND. THOSE WOODS. THEY'RE DEEP. IS THERE A LANDMARK? ANYWHERE SHE MIGHT'VE GONE? Naira: THERE IS A SHACK. Naira: I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF IT'S STILL STANDING. Naira: BUT MY HUSBAND TOOK ME OUT THERE ONCE. Naira: HE SAID THERE WAS EVIDENCE OF RITUALS Naira: HAVING BEEN PERFORMED IN THE AREA. Naira: DATING BACK TO NATIVE DAYS. Naira: WE MIGHT FIND SOMETHING THERE. WE? Naira: I HAVEN'T BEEN IN FOUR YEARS. I CAN'T DRAW YOU A MAP. Naira: I'D HAVE TO SEE IT. Naira: AND BESIDES THAT CONSIDERING WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH, Naira: YOUR GUN MIGHT NOT PROTECT YOU. Naira: THEY SAY YOU CAN ONLY KILL THESE THINGS BY EXPOSING THEIR Naira: TRUE IDENTITY. Naira: USUALLY WITH THE HELP OF A SHAMAN. SO, YOU'RE A SHAMAN? Naira: CLOSE ENOUGH. [ baleful music ] [ branches snapping ] Leah: YOU DIDN'T WANT TO GO OUT SHOPPING WITH MAYA? GET YOUR MIND OFF THINGS? NO, MY MOM COULD BE BACK AT ANY MINUTE. YOU GUYS HAVE ANY, LIKE, GAMES OR SOMETHING? WE DO. WE'LL HAVE FUN. [ car approaching ] ETHAN: HI, MRS. BLOOMFIELD? Leah: HI. I'M ETHAN. JOSE- UH, SHERIFF MORALES TOLD YOU I'D BE BY. YES. UH, HE SAID HE'D SEND SOMEONE TO KEEP AN EYE ON THE HOUSE. WELL I'M NOT A DEPUTY, BUT I DID SERVE 30 YEARS IN THE NAVY. SO, I HELP OUT WHEN HE NEEDS IT. THANK YOU. WE APPRECIATE THAT. IT'S MY PLEASURE, MA'AM. I WON'T BE A BOTHER. I PACKED DINNER. I HAVE SOME DRINKS. AND IF I, UH, NEED A BATHROOM. I'LL JUST HOP OUT INTO THE WOODS AND FIND A TREE. Ethan: SO DON'T YOU WORRY ABOUT A THING. I'LL JUST PULL UP OVER HERE AND BE OUT OF YOUR WAY. [ tribal music ] [ suspenseful music ] [ low growl ] [ leaves rustling ] Morales: DO YOU MIND WAITING OUT HERE? Naira: NOW, WHY WOULD I DO THAT? Morales: IN CASE SOMEONE DANGEROUS REALLY IS OUT THERE? WHAT, ANGELA? A DEER? Naira: I'D BE SURPRISED IF THE WITCH WERE OUT HERE DURING THE DAY. Naira: AND IN THE EVENT THAT SHE IS WE'RE SAFER TOGETHER. ANY IDEA WHAT IT IS? Naira: MY HUSBAND WOULD'VE BEEN ABLE TO TELL YOU EVERYTHING. I CAN'T. BUT I DO RECOGNIZE SOME OF THE SYMBOLS. Naira: THE BIG DIAMOND SHAPE. Naira: AND SOME OF THE OUTER MARKINGS HAVE TO DO WITH OPENING- Naira: OR CLOSING A DOOR. OR A GATE. IT'S TOO CONVOLUTED TO TELL FOR CERTAIN. [ gasps ] >>YOU SEE SOMETHING? [ Morales screams ] [ Maya's ears going hollow ] [ gloomy music ] [ Morales grunting, Maya gasps ] WHY? WHY DID YOU... Naira: YOU LEFT ME NO CHOICE. NOT REALLY. [ Morales groaning ] I TOLD YOU TO LET THINGS BE. LEAH IS PROBABLY GOING TO MAKE THE SACRIFICE, WHEN SHE DOES Naira: HER DAUGHTER WILL BE SPARED. [Morales choking ] Naira: IF YOU HADN'T INSISTED ON COMING OUT HERE, Naira: ALL WOULD'VE BEEN WELL WITH YOU. BUT, YOUR DEATH ISN'T GOING TO BE WITHOUT PURPOSE. I NEEDED THE BLOOD OF ONE MORE TO COMPLETE THE RITUAL. I WOULD'VE HAD TO LURE OR DRAG SOMEONE OUT HERE. YOU MADE IT EASY. YOU'RE... YOU'RE THE WITCH. YOU KILLED ANGELA. NECESSARY SACRIFICE. NOTHING I TAKE PLEASURE IN. BUT IF IT MAKES YOU FEEL BETTER. YOUR LIFE SAVED SOMEONE ELSE'S. [ Morales gasping ] [ high-pitched, distorted sound ] [ high-pitched, distorted sound fades out ] NOTHING, STILL? I WAS HOPING YOU'D HEARD FROM HER. NO, AND I'VE CALLED HER EVERY FIVE MINUTES. LITERALLY. Leah: I CAN'T GET A HOLD OF THE SHERIFF. Leah: ETHAN SAID HE HASN'T EVEN RESPONDED OVER THE RADIO SINCE THIS AFTERNOON. DETECTIVE SHAEFER'S OUT LOOKING. WELL, THERE HAS TO BE SOME KIND OF REASONABLE EXPLANATION. I MEAN, WE SHOULDN'T JUMP TO CRAZY CONCLUSIONS, YET. I HAVE TO GO OUT THERE. I CAN'T SIT AT HOME KNOWING THAT MAYA'S IN TROUBLE. WELL, WE DON'T KNOW THAT, YET. ESTHER'S IN GOOD HANDS WITH YOU HERE. Leah: I'M GOING TO CHECK IN WITH ETHAN AND LOOK AROUND THE WOODS. Leah: I WON'T GO FAR. KEEP THIS LOCKED UNLESS YOU HEAR MY VOICE. WELL, HOW DO I KNOW IT'S YOU? NOTHING'S GETTING PAST ME.

Maya: WHAT IF SHE'S ALREADY THERE? Sabrina: I NEED YOU TO STAY CALM, MAYA. Sabrina: I'M DOING EVERYTHING I CAN. STAY ON THE LINE. Sabrina: I'M REACHING OUT TO OTHER UNITS, BUT I'LL BE HERE. Sabrina: CALLING ALL UNITS. THIS IS DETECTIVE SABRINA SHAEFER. Sabrina: WE HAVE A SITUATION. OFFICER DOWN. IT WAS SHERIFF MORALES. Sabrina: SUSPECT FLED ON FOOT AND IS TO BE CONSIDERED ARMED AND DANGEROUS. [ police radio chatter ] [ tender music ] Leah: WHAT HAPPENED? UH- WE SAW SOMETHING AND THIS LADY CAME IN. IT WAS NAIRA. SHE DID SOMETHING TO MY EYES... AND THEN SHE SCARED IT AWAY. Leah: OKAY, OKAY. I'M GOING TO GO CHECK ON HER. I'LL BE BACK. Grace: OKAY. Esther: OKAY. LOCK THAT DOOR. WE WILL, WE WILL. >>BE CAREFUL. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? I CAME TO HELP ESTHER. I JUST STOPPED HERE FOR... WATER. [ coughing ] NAIRA. Leah: WAS IT YOU? ALL OF THIS? I WAS... INVOLVED. [ coughing ] I'M THE WITCH. IN THE FLESH. YOU HURT MAYA? SHE HANDLED HERSELF JUST FINE. I ONLY ATTACKED HER BECAUSE SHE WENT WHERE SHE SHOULDN'T HAVE. AND ESTHER? Naira: MOLECH CHOSE HER. I WAS ONLY FOLLOWING ORDERS. TRYING TO MAKE YOU ALL BELIEVE. TRYING TO MAKE YOU AFRAID. WHY? SO THAT YOU'D DO WHAT HE SAID. TO SAVE HER. AND TO PLAY INTO HIS HANDS LIKE EVERYONE IN SELAH. Naira: THE TRADITIONS DON'T ALWAYS WORK. IT'S... AN ACT OF WORSHIP, WHICH IS HIS MAIN GOAL. BUT... HE WANTS THE CHILDREN, TOO. AND YOU PRETENDED TO BE MY FRIEND. TO HELP. [ emotional music ] THERE WAS NO PRETENDING, LEAH. I ADMIRE YOU. EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU. [ Naira coughing hard ] [ Naira gasping for air ] [ suspenseful music ] [ heavy breathing ] LISTEN TO ME. THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO KEEP ESTHER SAFE FOR SURE. ONCE MOLECH HAS CHOSEN HE WON'T GIVE UP. BUT HE WILL ACCEPT... AN OFFERING. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? THE COPS ARE GOING TO BE BUSY AT THE WAREHOUSE FOR A FEW DAYS. [ emotional music ] THE GARAGE AT MY PLACE. GO THERE. SEE. ACCEPT IT. AND LEAVE. NOTHING ELSE. DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME? SEE WHAT? I CAN'T TELL YOU. JUST... DO AS I SAY FOR ESTHER'S SAKE. IT'S THE ONLY WAY TO KEEP HER SAFE. PLEASE? [ breathing heavier ] SOMEONE'S GOT TO BE ON THE WAY. IF YOU HANG IN THERE, THEY CAN HELP YOU. NO. I DIDN'T EVEN THINK I WOULD MAKE IT HERE. BUT I HAD TO TRY. FOR YOU. [ phone vibrates ] MY DAD'S PICKING ME UP IN FIVE. GOING TO THE POLICE DEPARTMENT. LAST TIME I WENT TO THE GROCERY STORE, I SAW A GUY STARING AT A CARTON OF ORANGE JUICE. I ASKED HIM WHY, AND HE SAID, 'I'M JUST CONCENTRATING'. WHAT DO YOU CALL A LAUGHING MOTORCYCLE? A YAMAHAHA. [ Esther and Grace giggling ] Esther: GRACE, WHY DID THE CHICKEN CROSS THE ROAD? WHY? TO GET TO THE IDIOT'S HOUSE. KNOCK KNOCK. THAT DOESN'T EVEN MAKE ANY... WHO'S? REALLY? [ all laughing ] I GOT ANOTHER ONE. SO MY FRIEND, HE GOT IN AN ACCIDENT. AND HE DIED BECAUSE NO ONE COULD FIGURE OUT HIS BLOOD TYPE. HE KEPT SAYING B POSITIVE. BUT IT'S HARD TO WITHOUT HIM. [ Maya and Grace laugh ] HEY WORM. WHY COULDN'T THE TOILET PAPER CROSS THE ROAD? WHY? HE GOT STUCK IN A CRACK. [ Esther and Grace laughing ] [ dramatic music ] Sabrina: WE'RE FINISHED. YOU CAN GO BACK IN WHEN YOU'D LIKE. IT'S CLEAN. WE LEFT NO TRACE OF WHAT HAPPENED. THANK YOU. WE'RE JUST WAITING FOR GRACE'S DAD TO GET BACK AND THEN WE'LL HEAD OVER. Sabrina: OKAY. Sabrina: IF YOU NEED ANYTHING, JUST LET US KNOW. WITH THE SHERIFF GONE THINGS ARE GOING TO BE MOVING A LITTLE SLOWER THAN NORMAL AROUND HERE. IT'LL TAKE A COUPLE OF DAYS TO GET THE RIGHT PERSONNEL Sabrina: -OUT TO THAT WAREHOUSE. NOT TO MENTION HER RESIDENCE, BUT... WE'LL BE ON TOP OF IT. AND WE'LL KEEP YOU GUYS SAFE. ALL OF YOU. THANK YOU, DETECTIVE. TAKE CARE, MS. BLOOMFIELD. [ dramatic music fades out ] [ mellow guitar music ] WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO TELL WORM? THAT I'M TAKING CARE OF SOMETHING FOR NAIRA. WHICH IS TRUE. YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GETTING YOURSELF INTO. IF I SEE ANYTHING SUSPICIOUS... IF I EVEN FEEL SOMETHING'S OFF I WILL TURN AROUND. I'M NOT TAKING ANY CHANCES. WHICH IS WHY I HAVE TO GO. HOW DO YOU KNOW IT ISN'T OVER ALREADY? IT ISN'T. I HAD THAT SAME NIGHTMARE LAST NIGHT. Leah: I DON'T KNOW HOW, I JUST... I KNOW SHE'S STILL IN DANGER. THEN... MOM. Maya: LET'S TRUST IN GOD. WE DON'T JUST HAVE FAITH UNTIL THINGS GET CRAZY, RIGHT? THAT'S NOT TRUE FAITH. Maya: WHY DON'T YOU JUST STAY HOME? WE CAN PRAY THROUGH THE NIGHT. I KNOW THAT SOUNDS RIDICULOUS COMING FROM ME. BUT... IF I'VE LEARNED ANYTHING IN ALL OF THIS. IT'S TO DO THINGS THE RIGHT WAY. I CAN'T ARGUE WITH YOU. BUT I HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING I POSSIBLY CAN FOR ESTHER'S SAKE RIGHT NOW. NAIRA'S WASN'T ALL BAD. I DON'T THINK SHE SPENT HER DYING BREATH LURING ME INTO SOME TRAP. Leah: I HAVE TO EXHAUST EVERY SINGLE AVENUE THAT I HAVE, BECAUSE IF I DON'T DO THAT AND THEN SOMETHING AWFUL HAPPENS TONIGHT... I JUST... I WON'T BE ABLE TO LIVE WITH MYSELF. Julie: NAIRA SAID YOU'D COME. THAT YOU HAD TO. FOR IT TO WORK. Leah: YOU'RE JULIE DEVLIN? ARE YOU HERE ALL ALONE? SHE CALLED ME. SHE TOLD ME THERE WAS A WAY I COULD HELP SAMANTHA ESCAPE. ESCAPE? Julie: SHE SAID THAT... SHE WAS TRAPPED SOMEWHERE. LIKE... IN ANOTHER DIMENSION. THAT'S WHERE THE MONSTERS TOOK HER. DID YOU COME HERE ALL BY YOURSELF? PART OF THE WAY. SHE TOLD ME HOW, AND THEN SHE PICKED ME UP YESTERDAY MORNING. I'VE BEEN WAITING HERE, SINCE. WERE YOU OKAY? Leah: DID YOU HAVE FOOD? YEAH, SHE HAD STUFF HERE. I WAS OKAY. Julie: IT WAS A LITTLE CREEPY AT NIGHT BUT NOTHING HAPPENED. YOU LIVE IN MY HOUSE, NOW. YOU'VE SEEN SAMANTHA? MY GIRLS HAVE. SO, WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO? SHE ONLY TOLD ME THAT I HAD TO COME... AND LEAVE. THAT'S ALL SHE SAID TO ME. BUT I HAVE TO TELL YOU WHAT I'M DOING. AT MIDNIGHT, I HAVE TO FILL THE BARREL. POUR SOME OF THAT IN. LIGHT THE CANDLES. Julie: GET IN THE WATER WITH THE BIG CANDLE. Julie: AND CALL OUT FOR SAMANTHA. Julie: AND THEN PUT THE CANDLE OUT IN THE WATER. AND... THEN SHE'LL APPEAR. AND I GUESS I'LL BE ABLE TO HELP HER. I KNOW IT ALL SOUNDS CRAZY. I ONLY KNEW HER FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS, BUT... I FELT BAD I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING MORE FOR HER WHEN I HAD THE CHANCE. Julie: AND THEN MY PARENTS LIED TO ME. ALL THIS TIME, THEY MADE ME THINK I MADE IT UP. THEY PUT ME ON MEDICATION. Leah: MADE ME SEE DOCTORS. [ melancholy music ] BUT IT WAS... IT WAS ALL REAL. THIS WHOLE TIME. Leah: I'M SO SORRY, JULIE. COME HERE. Julie: YOU BETTER LEAVE. SHE SAID YOU HAD TO GO. YEAH. I DON'T FEEL RIGHT JUST LEAVING YOU HERE. IT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO DO. Leah: I KNOW. Leah: I'M GOING TO COME BACK. IN THE MORNING. MAYBE LATER TONIGHT. I'M GOING TO GET YOU HOME. OKAY? OKAY. I'LL BE FINE TILL THEN. Julie: DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME. THANK YOU. LEAH. [ melancholy music fades out ] [ suspenseful music builds ] [ loud impact ] MAYA. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? Esther: RELAX, BRO. YOU DIDN'T FEEL THAT? YEAH, YOU WOKE ME UP. THE WHOLE HOUSE SHOOK, WORM. THAT WASN'T ME. WHATEVER. [ footsteps on roof ] [ suspenseful music builds ] ESTHER. WE NEED TO GO DOWNSTAIRS NOW. WORM! COME ON. WHAT? I'M TIRED. Maya: IT ISN'T SAFE UP HERE. [ thunder rumbling ] Esther: IS IT AN EARTHQUAKE? SOUNDS LIKE IT. THE BASEMENT IS THE SAFEST PLACE TO GO DURING AN EARTHQUAKE, RIGHT? IF THAT'S WHAT IT IS? YEAH, COME ON. [ melancholy piano music ] Naira: SEE, ACCEPT IT, AND LEAVE. Naira: NOTHING ELSE? DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME! Naira: DO AS I SAY FOR ESTHER'S SAKE. IT'S THE ONLY WAY TO KEEP HER SAFE. Naira: PLEASE? NO. NO. PLEASE. KEEP ESTHER SAFE. [ dramatic music ] CAN I GO TO SLEEP NOW? OR SHOULD I STAY AWAKE? Esther: ARE YOU SCARED? NO, I'M - I'M FINE. Maya: GO TO SLEEP. I'LL KEEP WATCH. OKAY. WHAT ABOUT MOM? Maya: SHE'LL BE FINE. THE EARTHQUAKE ISN'T THAT BAD ANYWAY. I DON'T... THINK IT'LL REACH HER WHERE SHE IS. GOOD. WE'LL BE OKAY HERE, JUST... BE QUIET, OKAY? WE DON'T WANT THE VIBRATIONS TO...

PLEASE DON'T LET IT TAKE ESTHER. YOU SHALL NOT BE AFRAID OF THE TERROR BY NIGHT. NOR OF THE PESTILENCE THAT WALKS IN THE DARKNESS.

[ flames crackling ] [ sad, piano music ] IT WAS A TRICK. I'M SORRY. SAMANTHA'S GONE. Leah: BUT BELIEVE ME, SHE'S IN A BETTER PLACE. SHE KNOWS YOU DID EVERYTHING YOU COULD. NONE OF THIS IS YOUR FAULT. ONLY WITH YOUR EYES SHALL YOU LOOK AND SEE THE REWARD OF THE WICKED. BECAUSE YOU HAVE MADE THE LORD- Chris: GIRLS! Grace: MAYA, WHERE ARE YOU? MAYA, WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED? ARE YOU GUYS OKAY? WE'RE FINE NOW. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT WAS. IT WAS AN EARTHQUAKE, DUMMY. LISTEN, I'M GOING TO GO CALL FOR HELP AND SEE IF I HAVE ANYTHING TO PATCH UP THAT WINDOW WITH, OKAY? OH, THANK GOD! Grace: YOU'RE OKAY. YOU'RE BOTH OKAY. Grace: THANK GOD. [ typing on keyboard ] [ knock at door ] JIN: HEY. HEY. HAVE ANYTHING, YET? NOT REALLY. NOTHING CONCRETE ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY THE HOURS I'M PUTTING INTO IT. ACCORDING TO THE BOSS. ON THE NEWS THEY'RE SPECULATING THAT JULIE MIGHT'VE HAVE MULTIPLE PERSONALITIES. RIGHT, WHICH WOULD EXPLAIN ALL OF THIS. EVEN THE DISTINCT HANDWRITING. I CAN'T FIND ANY MISSING CHILDREN IN THE DATABASE WITH HER DESCRIPTION. I COULDN'T EITHER. I WAS LOOKING MOSTLY AROUND OREGON SINCE SHE MENTIONED A RESERVOIR, AND WANTING TO RIDE ALL 33 MILES ON A BIKEWAY. YEAH, I CHECKED THERE, TOO. Jin: NO MISSING CHILDREN THAT COULD'VE BEEN HER. NO. Jin: BUT. I KEPT ON DIGGING. AND I EXPANDED MY SEARCH A LITTLE BIT, Jin: AND I FOUND THIS. Jin: LAST YEAR. DECEMBER 22ND. PINE HOLLOW, OREGON LOCAL. MISSING LOCAL GIRL PRESUMABLY DROWNED. BLAH BLAH BLAH. A BRIEF SEARCH TURNED UP EVIDENCE THAT THE GIRL MAY HAVE DROWNED IN THE DESCHUTES RIVER. Jin: CREWS FROM THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE FOUND A SNEAKER ON THE SHORE, JUST OFF THE BIKEWAY AND LATER DISCOVERED A DAMAGED BICYCLE THAT HAD CAUGHT ON THE ROCKS 20 FEET INTO THE WATER. Sabrina: ATTEMPTS TO RECOVER A BODY HAVE PROVED UNSUCCESSFUL. BUT PINE HOLLOW RESIDENT DONALD MYERS, 44, IDENTIFIED THE SHOE AND BIKE AS BELONGING TO HIS 11 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER, SAMANTHA. SHE WAS DECLARED DEAD A FEW MONTHS LATER WHEN THEY COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING ELSE. [ melancholy piano music ] I - I COULDN'T GIVE IT UP FOR HER SAKE, BUT... HONESTLY I WAS HOPING WE WOULDN'T FIND ANYTHING. THIS JUST DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. FEAR CAN MAKE PEOPLE DO CRAZY THINGS. THEY'D ALREADY LOST THEIR SON. Jin: IF THEY THOUGHT THEIR DAUGHTER WAS IN DANGER-p>>THEIR SON WENT MISSING IN THE WOODS. JUST LIKE A LOT OF KIDS IN SELAH. BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT THEY BELIEVE. [ gentle, emotional music ] I ASKED THE POLICE IF I COULD HAVE EVERYTHING BACK. EVERYTHING I FOUND. THEY SAID THERE WAS NO FAMILY AROUND TO CLAIM IT, SO... THEY CAME YESTERDAY AND DROPPED IT OFF. YOU CAN HAVE IT ALL BACK IF YOU WANT. NO. IT'S OKAY. FINDERS KEEPERS. I DON'T DESERVE IT. YOU ACTUALLY KNEW HER. I DON'T KNOW WHAT I SAW. WELL... WHATEVER IT WAS, IT MADE YOU CARE ABOUT HER. WHETHER IT MEANT TO OR NOT. I CAN ALWAYS COME HERE. IT'S A LITTLE FAR FROM YOU. CLOSER THAN OREGON. YOU HAVE THE LETTERS? THE PICTURES WE DREW? I'LL JUST TAKE THE PICTURES. IF THAT'S OKAY? I THINK IT'LL HELP ME TO STAY GROUNDED. ESPECIALLY SINCE EVERYTHING IS SO CRAZY RIGHT NOW. THEY'RE YOURS. AND IF YOU NEED ANYBODY TO TALK TO... ABOUT ANYTHING. I'M HERE. I'LL GIVE YOU MY MOM-MOMS ADDRESS. WE CAN WRITE EACH OTHER. THAT'D BE COOL. [ CAPTIONS PROVIDED BY SHADY DAWN PICTURES ]
