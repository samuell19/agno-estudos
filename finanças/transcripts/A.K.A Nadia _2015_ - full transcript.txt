We'll be in touch. I gotta go. Okay, bye. -Bye. It's so good to feel you. My love. I've missed you. You've gotten so strong! Weren't you supposed to return in two weeks? Not that I'm complaining... I have something important to tell you. They're sending me to England. England? They need me there. For how long? There's no talk about returning. I can't refuse and I don't want to. Don't be angry. Where do you hang out so late? Look at me when I'm speaking to you. Nadia, don't do anything stupid. I'm tired. May I go to sleep? Hello, chief. - Hello, how are you? In two hours the curfew will begin. Please stay at home. Nimer! What happened? Is everything okay? Are you all right? What's going on? I'm coming to England with you. England? You don't understand. It's complicated. I don't know if we can get you a passport. I do understand. I met Ibrahim this morning. He said they could use my Hebrew. You don't understand. This isn't a Jewish-Arab seminar. You could never go home again. If you try they'll throw you in jail. I know what I'm doing. I thought about it all night. - You thought about it?! Did you think about never seeing your mother again? Did you? What will you do without your mother? Of course I thought about it. But if I stay here, they will force me to marry someone else. I wish you could trust me like I trust you. Enough. I would give my life for you. Nimer Kassem, do you take Nadia Kabir to be your wife until the white wings of death do you part? I do. Nadia Kabir, do you take Nimer Kassem to be your husband until the white wings of death do you part? I do. Watch your head. My beauty, tonight you are the queen... Samira... It's so quiet outside. You're very quiet today, too. I'll never be able to cook like this without you. That's exactly what I told my mother before I got married and look at me now... Are you planning to leave any of the potato at all? Let's see how you do it. That's better. Mom... There's something I have to tell you. Don't. Why not? I don't want to hear it. You know how orthodox your brother is. Keep peeling! Hello. -Hello. Thank you. God bless you. Thank God you made it safely. I've missed you so much. Hello. How are you, Nimer? - Praise Allah. Nadia, Oum Nasser. Pleased to meet you. You have a pretty wife. Thank you. - Go on up. It's just for the meantime. - It's fine, really. I'll come back tonight to see how you're settling in. I have a few more things to tell you. It's very important to keep a low profile here. If you need something, anything, ask Oum Nasser. You mustn't contact me. Understand? I'll come to see you every day. Every day I can. Here's an address in case of emergency. Nadia... Only if there's an emergency. I have to go now. Love you. Thank you. You're welcome. I was worried about you. Is something wrong? I missed you. The briefing took longer than I thought. I've missed you very much. Look what I have for you. It's a poetry book by Taha Muhammad Ali. Someone brought it along from Israel. I borrowed it for a few days. I'm not planning to give it back. Do you know this poet? Listen. â€œThe earth is a traitor The earth will not be true The earth is not secure The earth is a whore Seducing the years Running a bar for the sailors Laughing in all tongues And swaying its hips for anyone." It's beautiful. - You're beautiful. Nimer? Nimer? Hello, Clean Laundry. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, thank you. I need 264. Who has number 264? Delivery in five minutes. Hello, my dear. What have you got for me? Thank you. Wait. Can I...? How can I help you? Can you help me get out of this place? I have to go back home. Can you get me papers? What made you imagine I could do that? I heard you helped others. They told me that you were a cop once? Did they indeed? Better come inside. Hello. - Oh... Wait, I have to check that everything's here. Okay, you can go now. Hello. What can I do for you two? Well, I was in the area, and I just thought I'd come and pick up... the blouse. The blue stripe. - That's the one. How's Frank? - Oh, he's doing all right. Still always in the bookie's, is he? - Always. That it? -That's the one. - Okay. Thank you. - All right, see you next time. Give Frank my regards. - Bye. Ladies. It's all I have managed to save up until now. It's everything I have. Good girl. Well done. Who could refuse a pretty little thing like yourself? Now, you understand, these things take time. And I will prefer you to keep your distance while I carry out my investigations. I'll send for you. Thank you. Coming up, three, and out, and arm down, and down, lifting fifth, and hold other arm off the bar, and hold, lowering all the way down. Thank you, girls. And into the center. Let's have some pirouettes. And prepare. Hello, Clean Laundry. Oh, yes. Yes, of course. Yeah. Okay, thank you. Delivery for 347. No, not you, Faiza. They asked for Nadia. She was born in Israel to a Jewish family. They moved over here and the whole family died in a horrendous car crash. She was about your age, and those are the original papers from Israel. Congratulations, Miss Almozlino. It's a Jewish passport? I promised to get you back into your country. I have delivered. Nadia, I have already told you, if you go home you will be regarded as a terrorist. Now, those papers are flawless, but if you go wandering into East Jerusalem they won't be any bloody use to you at all. I can do nothing more for you. Mom, happy birthday from your son who loves you although it doesn't always show. Mom, I have just one thing to say today: We're the lucky ones. Maya, My love, after 20 years together you still make my heart miss a beat and wish us another 20 years like these and for now we dedicate to you this piece that you love so much. Happy birthday, my love. Together, together. Together. Just take it from her, okay? Feel it. And... Good. Feet, toes. Stretch your legs, Tomer. Noa, less shoulders. No, Tomer, you're way ahead. And... Okay, fine. Okay, not bad. I want to work on the trio like we did yesterday. Let's see where we go from there. Meanwhile, show the others "the dog". - Okay. Girls... -Okay. And... go. Release. Together. I want to try to switch them. Nice. Hey. -Happy birthday, darling. - Thanks. Can I have a word with them about what we were talking about? Yes. Just a minute, Yehiel has news. Listen up, people, in two days a delegation from the EU and the Palestinian Authority arrives. If they like what they see, we'll get a big part of the funding... Excuse me. - And we'll get this show on the road. Okay? I don't have to tell you what that means. I want you at your best, fresh, full of energy, no less than 8 hours of sleep, Tomer... Don't forget the extra leashes, okay? I don't want any screw-ups, is that clear? Okay. - W hen are they coming, Yehiel? We'll let you know. Don't worry, okay? You're wonderful, it'll be fine. Israeli ID holders to the right. Israeli ID holders to the right. Oh, God... There's plenty of food. I've made your favorite. Hi. - Hey. Sorry. That's hot. Crazy day at work. Mom, I'm sick of this. There's nothing to eat. Look at this. You're so selfish! I've missed a demonstration to cook dinner for you! The nerve! Geez! I'm sorry. - Sit down, I'll fix you a plate Did you do your homework? - Yeah. That's enough. Bon appetit. So how is it? Very tasty, actually. - I told you so. You're such a jerk today. Jerk! Dad's home. Hey. -Hey. Wow, what a day. Want to order takeaway? Pizza. Let's order pizza. - Sushi. What did I miss? Don't you see there's food on the table? I didn't notice. Yaeli... Come on, I'm sorry. I didn't notice. Let's not make a big deal of it, okay? Is it edible? - No. Here, Mom. This is for the parent-teacher meeting. You're at 18:20, okay? Look. Very nice, Assafi. Where are we? - Here. Nice. Stop it. Don't be so aggressive. You know he didn't mean it. I know, but it wouldn't kill him to apologize for once. Wow, this is delicious. What is it? Want some? Just a taste. Like it? - Wow! The leash got caught. - Yeah, we need to work on it. Maya, the delegation's here. Okay, Yehiel, we're in the middle, so keep quiet. -Fine. Thanks. Aya's falling still isn't good. She holds on too tight. They have to work on the lift. Much better. - Yes. Okay... Okay, let's stop here. It's much better. I know you're tired. Let's try to work it into the movement. If you're tired, put it in the movement, okay? More of the desperation of the movement. You wanted to work on Aya's fall.. - Right. Aya, come show me your fall. Something feels too tense. Can you feel her? Hold her tight. Don't be scared, Aya. - Breathe out. -Let her do it. Excellent. That's the way. You too, I want to feel your weight on her. Let's do it again. No fear. Good. Turn off the light. What's the matter? Nothing, everything's all right. Are you sure? - Go back to sleep, Yoav. It's all right. Go back to sleep. Nimer Kassem West Bank cultural attache' to the EU What is it, Vered? Okay, no problem. Listen, Vered, start without me, I'll... I'll be there later. Okay, thanks. EU Commission Assafi... Yaeli... Dad, she's not here. She went to a demonstration again. - Damn it! I... Yaeli, answer the phone. You know I can't have you going there. We've been through this! I'm not going to let this slide. I'm sorry. Just once I ask you to do something... - Iâ€™m having a busy day and it slipped my mind. And I have a premiere and I left in the middle of rehearsals, ok? It slipped your mind? I asked you not to be late, right? They skipped our turn. I'm sorry, sweetie, I have to go. Dad will go in with you, okay? - Okay. Come on, buddy. Introduce me to your teacher. I don't know, something's missing. Why don't we break up the diagonal in the middle so they aren't parallel the whole time? - I have to see it. I'll take care of it. - Okay. Start in that position and then keep going and let's try to break up the diagonal, okay? And then, Gilad, spread out a little because it's very repetitive. Okay? I owe you an apology. And a cup of coffee. - Yoav, this is really a bad time. Five minutes? - I don't have time for this. Then one minute in the office. I really can't. - One minute! This is for you. I'm sorry. Tighter. Should we lock the door? You know what I'm like before premieres. You have nothing to worry about. What I saw looks fantastic. Want some coffee? What are you doing here anyway? Looking for excuses to get out of the office. This racist legislation is killing me. Sometimes I hate my job. Five, four, three, two, one, and up. Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, sit down, keep going and keep the pace. Let's take it up a notch. Keep going! Excellent. Don't stop. Good. Let's take it even higher. Excellent. Last ride. Give it all you got. Eight, seven... I can hardly breathe. She takes no prisoners. But what a body, huh? No? For me, that lesson is a life saver. It takes my mind off the fight with Yaeli. You should be proud of her. I wish my students had such independent thinking. -Yeah. I'm just afraid it's drifting us apart. - So let her know you're glad she has character, despite your disagreement. For Yaeli, everything is either black or white. And somehow, I'm always on the black side. And what does Maya have to say? - Maya... Maya wants her daughter to come home from the demonstrations in one piece. The last thing she cares about is politics. - Actually, I've never heard her talk politics. What? 20 years ago I was at what's-his-name's birthday party... Guy Remember him? - Yeah, sure. Anyway, the whole gang from school and university was there, and what do I usually do at parties? I argue politics! Anyway we were arguing... It was right before elections. And all this time there was this girl sitting by herself, not talking, only listening. We go on arguing when suddenly she gets up, goes over to the stereo, turns up the music, stands in the middle of the room and starts to dance. I couldn't take my eyes off her. The play was adapted to contemporary times, now it's full of psychology-ism. Rosetta, a strong woman, realizes that she alone is responsible for her destiny. The play is her self examination. and she realizes she has no one to blame but herself. The audience learns a fascinating lesson about the boundaries of human freedom. Like it? Bon appetit. I've always loved cooking for you. I can tell when you like it. You can tell with Yaeli, too. She loves your cooking. Too bad she doesn't know it's yours. So how are they? This one's recent. He's grown! What a cutie. He's sweet. They're both sweet. I have something to show you, too. She looks just like you. When I told her how much she resembles her aunt your brother said never to mention your name in his house. He's a difficult man, your brother. Eat. Mom... - My love. I saw Nimer. I don't want to hear it. - Wait, Mom, listen. He has been hiding in caves for 15 years. Suddenly, 20 years later, the government decides to pardon him. Mom, I feel I have to go see him. - Not another word. I don't want to hear it. Who else can I tell this to? I can't say anything to anyone. I can't either. Forget about him. He brought upon us nothing but trouble. It was my decision. It's not his fault, Mom. I've learned things I wasn't aware of. It's not his fault, Mom. It is his fault! It's his fault that you're a Jew. Hi. Hey. You look exhausted. Want to eat something? - No, I'm not hungry, just tired. How was your day? Rehearsals, rehearsals, rehearsals. How was your meeting? What meeting? I came by your studio this afternoon, Vered said you were at a meeting. Oh, that. Nothing important, it was just about the scenery And I bought myself something for the premiere. I have to sit down. Come with me to the living room. I'll be done in a minute. Come with me. I'll be right there. Okay... This or the other color? What do you think? Mom? Mom?! This one or the other color? - Those are very pretty. -You think so? Okay. Cool. All right... Your turn. I have to go see what's up with Ziad. What are you talking about? - I told you yesterday. After we were detained as you know, they had detained all of us, but... they took Ziad away. - Took him away? Arrested him. We were all doing the same thing. The exact same thing, Mom. But being an Arab in this fucked-up place... Are we finished here? Mom, what about you? You said you don't have anything for the premiere. Wait a sec. Excuse me, do you have this in size 40? Great, thanks. Mom, there's something I want to talk to you about. -Yes? As you know, I've been very politically involved lately... Here you go, size 40 in black. We also have brown and camel. Thanks. -Thanks. Anyway... As the date approaches I don't feel like I can go to the army. I feel like... I have to get out of here... I was thinking of living abroad for a while, maybe even London. What do you think? Yaeli, this isn't exactly the time to talk about it, right? Okay, just tell me what you think. Do you know what it means not to serve in this country? Imagine dad's reaction. - Okay, but I need some air. I feel like I have to get out of here, Mom. Besides, that's exactly what you did. - That's nothing like what I did! Not even close! Can we stop talking about this now? Can we discuss it at home? And I'm late for rehearsal. We'll take these. Despite all the time that's passed you're still so beautiful. Are you happy with your life? I'm sorry. Forgive me. Did anyone talk to mom? - Dad you're interrupting. No, no, no. It's not fair. Dad why do you seem so worried? Wanna have a go? No, no, keep going Okay. Did she say she was going to be late today? - Today? Recently she always comes back late. My turn to pick a song. Oh no, another girl song... Don't be an ass, I just played your picks. Let me pick. Hassan. Abu Masoud. Ashraf. Abu Guila. Abu Ramouz. Nimer Kassem. Muhamed? Is everything okay? Is there something you want to tell me? No, everything's fine. Go back to sleep. Haim? Yoav Goldwasser. How are you? Tell me, what do we know about Nimer Kassem? Thanks. Nadia Kabir East Jerusalem You've reached Goldwasser, Adv. Leave your name and number and I get back to you. Ok, I want to try something. Shira, take a look at this. What is this, Maya? What's going on? - Everything's fine, Vered. Read it out loud. "We didn't cry when..." - Excuse me, Maya, the EU called. Okay, Yehiel. Not now. They want the show but they don't understand why we have no Arab dancers. I don't know what to tell them. - Tell them that I make the decisions here. I decide who dances. This is my autonomy. It isn't about politics. And if the EU can't accept it, they don't have to take the show. Why do you get so upset? We all benefit from it. Fine, Yehiel, I have no time for this right now! Out loud. "We did not weep when we were leaving for we had neither time nor tears." â€œAnd there was no farewell." â€œWe did not know at the moment of parting that it was a parting.â€œ â€œSo where would our weeping have come from?â€œ If they get here before I do, just open the studio for them, okay? I may be a little late. Thanks. Good night. Why don't you answer my calls?! Where were you? I was worried sick, Yoav. What's the matter? Since yesterday I've been trying to figure out... what to say to you. And I can't. I don't know what to say. What are you talking about? You tell me. Nadia. Say something, god damn it! Yoav... Mom, could you help me do my math homework? Here. What do we learn from the fact that Y=AX+B is a linear function? Do you get it? No. Me neither. It doesn't work. It's too much. You said it wasn't enough and now you say it's too much? Can't you see it's not working? I don't know what to tell them anymore. I beg your pardon? - Iâ€™m sorry, but they're getting confused too. What don't you get? Maya, are you all right? - Yes, I'm fine, Vered. Just fine. What's with the interrogation? Okay. Okay. Let's stop for a second. Let's take it from the top, but... Come on, Dad. Dad, we're losing... Come on! Not there. There! Faster, Dad! But I don't have... - W hat are you doing? -Come on, Dad! That way, Dad! Dad, that way... Come on, Dad! Faster, Dad, we're losing! Just give up, you're losing anyway. Dad, you're too old for this. Nice going, Dad. - They won't do it either. Move! Turn it on. Go. -Start. Ready? I was born ready. - Go. That's the way. Yes. -Yes! Nice going. Good... I miss you. Yes, Michal? Maya's here. Yoav, please, I want to talk to you quietly. Go ahead. I want you to know... that there wasn't a single day in our lives together... that I didn't love you. So in the deepest sense I never lied to you. Don't. Don't try to cover it up with sweet talk. You lied to me in the deepest possible sense. How could you hide such a thing from me? Let it go, Yoav... What does it matter now? Do you hear what you're saying? What? What don't you get? It's only me and you. Nobody else knows. We could just go on like it used to be. Nothing can remain the same. Nothing. Think of your children. Nadia. They don't deserve to live like this. I have to get back to work. Peace, peace, peace... - How else can we stop the war? With terrorists? -With anyone. - With who, then? With whoever. Whoever you're dealing with. With Arafat? - You don't choose your enemies. You try to make peace with them. No, not with your enemy. - Your enemy wants to kill you. Arafat wants to kill us all. - What have we gained from all the wars besides more casualties? - We gained a state... Where people are getting blown up in the streets. You can't even send your kids to a Purim party. But we have to defend our country and the only way to defend it... Is to make peace. -No. The only way to defend it is through dialogue. -I agree. The need to defend it isn't a right-wing or left-wing matter I want to defend the country too. You want to defend it? So engage in a dialogue. With a terrorist? With your enemies, with whoever you can... 9:00 sharp tomorrow, please? - No problem. -Okay. Bye. -Bye.
