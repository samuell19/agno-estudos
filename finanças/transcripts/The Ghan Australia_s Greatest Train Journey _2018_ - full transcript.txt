BIRDSONG TRAIN HORN SOUNDS HORN SOUNDS Well, good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome aboard The Ghan. My name's Bruce Smith, and I'm your train manager on today's journey through to Alice Springs and then on to Darwin. On behalf of our crew, certainly like to give you a very warm welcome aboard The Ghan. Over the next three days we will be travelling from the bottom to the top of Australia. That's a distance of some 2,979km. Stopping at Alice Springs and Katherine on the way. For our guests that may be interested in statistics... ..we are 902 metres long. We weigh 1,773 tonnes. And we have 38 carriages on board today. Two locomotives at the front. 4,000 horsepower each. Our lead loco is NR 109. So, once again, ladies and gentlemen, welcome aboard The Ghan.

If you cast your eyes to the left-hand side of the train, in direction of travel, you can see what is known as the Barunga Ranges. And atop the Barunga Ranges is South Australia's largest wind farm, some 130 Commission wind turbines. We also happen to be ten minutes away from the very small township of Snowtown. As we pass through the township itself, if you look to the right-hand side of the train, once again in the direction of travel, you can see mounted in roughly the centre of the township one of the blades from the turbines. And it just gives you some idea as to the size of these turbines. They're quite large, ladies and gentlemen. So, the Barunga Range is on the left-hand side of the train, in the direction of travel, South Australia's largest wind farm, and as we pass through the township, one of the turbine blades mounted there. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, if you look out to the right-hand side now in the direction of travel, in the next seconds you can see the train in its entirety, from whatever position you are on the train. Please have your cameras ready, right-hand side of the train. Thank you. FAINT ARCHIVE RECORDING OF SONG TELEGRAPH CLICKS TELEGRAPH BLEEPS INSECT BUZZES Ladies and gentlemen, a very good afternoon. I trust you have enjoyed the first section of our journey from Adelaide to Port Augusta. We will be arriving into Port Augusta very soon for a short moment where we will have a driver's change, thank you. HORN SOUNDS ECHOES OF CHATTER AND ANIMAL SOUNDS ISLAMIC CALL TO PRAYER ECHOES And a very good morning to you all, ladies and gentlemen. Certainly trust you had a restful night's sleep during the night last night. We do have an anticipated arrival time of 1:45, an on-time arrival time... ..this afternoon into the lovely city of Alice Springs. Thank you. Wahey! N40 TSR coming up. Must've been a bit of rain. Yeah. A few puddles hanging around. If they closed the Birdsville track they must've had a... Oh, did they? Yeah, last week, I think it was closed. The Oodnadatta-Birdsville track was all shut. I've never seen any water in this, ever. The day I see water in it, then I can retire. And I'm thinking, well, you might work for another 50 years. One time when I was travelling with Shane, there was... We went through a fair bit of rain, and the next day found out from the length runner that travelled up after us that every single creek was flowing between Kulgera and Manguri. That's a lot of water. INDISTINCT CHATTER Good morning. How is everyone? Had a nice morning today? Good. Can I get anyone some drinks to start with? I'll have an orange juice. INDISTINCT CONVERSATION CONTINUES MUSIC PLAYS GENERAL CHATTER Train manager NR 109. INDISTINCT RESPONSE OVER RADIO Yeah, Bruce, approximately 10 minutes to the border. Over. INDISTINCT RESPONSE Good morning again, ladies and gentlemen. The locomotive drivers have just informed me we are approximately ten minutes away from the South Australian-Northern Territory border. If you cast your eyes to the right-hand side of the train in approximately ten minutes' time, there is border signage on the right-hand side of the train. So, ten minutes' time, ladies and gentlemen, the South Australian-Northern Territory border. Thank you. SLOW BLEEPING RAPID BLEEPING SLOW BLEEPING SUSTAINED BLEEP Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. The locomotive driver's just informed me we will be passing the... What is known as the Iron Man. Located on the right-hand side in direction of travel. And the Iron Man is a... ..statue erected by the... ..track layers when they built the Tarcoola to Alice Springs rail line. It stands about six foot high, ladies and gentlemen. Easily seen. But as I said, it commemorates the laying of the one millionth concrete sleeper on the, what was known as the Tas line - Tarcoola to Alice Springs rail line, back in the mid-'80s.

MOOING HORN SOUNDS FLOCK OF BIRDS CAWING And now, ladies and gentlemen, our next item of interest is the Finke River. The Finke's a fairly large river, and so it is certainly able to be seen from both the left and right-hand sides of the train. How many people are going to run the gauntlet today, you reckon, Scotty? Taxi just did, he wasn't going to get stuck. Here comes another one. HORN SOUNDS HORN SOUNDS Good boy! HORN SOUNDS HORN SOUNDS HORN SOUNDS HORN SOUNDS NR 109, this is good with you all, now?

I trust you had a restful night's sleep aboard the Ghan last night. You might have woken up at some time during the night, and find we had been stopped. That was at Tennant Creek, ladies and gentlemen - a brief stop there whilst we had a locomotive crew change. We're currently running on time, with an anticipated arrival time into Katherine this morning of 9am. I'll certainly update you with the outside temperature and the weather forecast for Katherine itself. Thank you.

The outside temperature as we speak now is 23 degrees, and we have a maximum of 33 degrees. And the forecast is two words today, ladies and gentlemen, and it is "mostly cloudy".
