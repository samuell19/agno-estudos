What happened? Champagne. A Lots of it. and... Some questionable dance moves in our favorite bar on Tuesday night. I did get to work on time. Just Uh.... couldn't for the life of me read the autocue It was all blurred. Being on Form is kind of necessary for life to you . -Coffee? -Yes. What now? Now I get to focus on Our Dream, Camille. Any Developments? Yes. There's a new investor. They're really interested. My agent wants to talk through a few key points with us tomorrow. I'll be there. Hi I'll take a regular Ice tea ,Please Oh.. Regular Lemon Ice tea. Oh My God. You're Camille Logan. Aren't you? You're even more Perfect in the flesh. I'm so jealous. Your life is like.. perfect I literally love you. Thank You. It's very sweet. I'm. I'm going to pay for these and say that I can bought Camille Logan a drink . -No, you don't have to. She said "A lively one". Love the material! Fab, isn’t it? -"I’m thinking clinched-in waist—” -“Full skirt.” Yes! Yes! I'll get a drawing over to you by the end of the week. -It’s short. 'The Paps' will have a field day with that. He's gone. Now. “Fancy a trip to Harvey Nic’s?” I can't. “I’ve been summoned by my father.” How careless of me. Are you all right? Take your time. I have a three o’clock appointment with Mr. Logan. Jake Sharp. Afternoon. Take a seat, Sharp. Your reputation is impressive. I never fail. -You received the down payment? -Yes. Everything you need to know about Camille is in that file. My daughter is very precious to me. Your job is to protect her. What does your daughter need protecting from, Mr. Logan?. Has there been a threat? Threats are part of the job. Grunt give him the flaming fire for crying out loud. Your services are a precautionary measure. You're going to have to give me a bit more on that. That arrived via courier yesterday, The demand for money. -Anything? -No. Nothing. So they just want to scare you. Many people want to scare me. Mr. Sharp. I'd rather just take your money. Everyone's motivation is.... ...different. I look into it. I assume you want to know who has been making these threats against your daughter's life. Of course. Camille's do momentarily. Perhaps, it's best If you're not here. When I tell her what's happening? -You haven't told her? -She can be fiery. She’s out there unprotected? I wanted everything in place first. You have a half hour. My little star ! Give me a hug! What’s up? Nothing, Sweetheart. Take a seat. You're looking particularly beautiful today. I'm so proud of you sweetheart. And I’d do anything to ensure your safety. Dad, I’m not— I received a message yesterday. A threatening one. Threatening you. It’s just idle threats, I’m sure. But I’ve taken precautionary measures, nevertheless. I can’t be too careful with my little star, can I? Okay. Good girl. Get him in. Jake Sharp, Good to go? Look after her. She’s in safe hands. What do you mean? [Stumbling] Look after her? Careful now. Sharp is your bodyguard. What? Bodyguard? Yes. No. No offense. None taken. I have a busy schedule. Modeling contracts to fulfill, Meetings to attend. Do you mean looking pretty in front of the camera? And negotiating a deal on my new fashion line. I doubt Mr. Sharp will appreciate having to endure the simplicities of my pointless career. I endure what I need to. I don't want or need a bodyguard following me around randomly. It won’t be random, It'll be constant. Twenty-four/seven. Camille Logan, this isn’t up for debate. Sharp will protect you. And you will not be difficult about it. [phone vibrating] Sebastian is back in town. You don't know me at all. Do You? The little… Ready or not, here I come. I’m not agreeing to you tailing me. I have a life, and I want to get on with it. Agree or not, You and I are going to be very close. Don't worry. I don’t bite. Maybe I do. I've been told I taste good. There is no threat, is there? My ex-boyfriend is back in town, and that’s the reason my dear father hired you. The threat is very real, Miss Logan. I’ve not been employed to keep you away from your ex-boyfriend. Oh my... I thought you were going to do a runner again. Since it seems like I'm going to be stuck with you, let's get a few things straight. Don't talk to me. Don't touch me. I'm going to pass by you know. This is ridiculous. Thought you’d call pronto, What happened with your dad? He hired a bodyguard for me. Apparently there’s been some sort of threat. Now Seb’s out of rehab, I’m suspicious. I'm at Picasso’s. Fancy, a glass of fizz? Yes. What the... This door should be locked. You’re not coming in my car. Not Today. No, but once we’ve sorted the logistics, you’ll be travelling with me... in my car. I’ll follow you home. I’m not… Fine. Bastard. Maybe you... You ever pull a stunt like that again, then I’ll… You’ll what? I’ll put you over my knee... And spank your fucking arse bright red. You’ll... spank me? It's just a... Figure of speech. A rather inappropriate one, don’t you think? Yes. Is that him? The bodyguard? Yes. He's... Gorgeous. He’s a twat. A fit twat. Don’t tell me you haven’t thought about him in bed. Change the subject. Saffron saw Sebastian. Is he clean? Saffron said his eyes were clear and his body not as strung as it always used to be. But... Who knows? So... Where’s he sleeping? Good question. I'm sleeping here... in case you're wondering. This is a violation of my human rights. Take it up with your father. I have my orders. I’m ordering you to leave me alone. You’re not paying me, Miss Logan. You do everything my father tells you to? Within reason. For fuck... Hey, Camille... this door is very pretty. Would be a shame to damage it. We can do this the easy way or the hard way. Sebastian Peters is back in town He nearly broke her. Keep your eye out for him as well. I don't want that shit anywhere near my daughter again. (recalling) You're job is to protect her. I don’t think Logan is giving us all the information. The threat came printed on paper that came fresh out of a ream. He said it arrived yesterday by courier. Check out the CCTV at Logan Tower. I’m on it. I’ve checked Logan’s e-mails... Nothing suspicious. How's it going? Don't ask. You women are difficult. Get me everything on Sebastian Peters. [Door Opening] [Camille Laughing] Why do you have a gun? To shoot you when you piss me off again. You’re a charmer, aren’t you?” You can sleep here. I’ll clear it. Fine. Get a good look, did you? Do you always sleep half-naked on a client’s couch? Judging me and have been falling downstairs? [Camille grunting] Move. No. I have an eleven o'clock meeting with my agent. I don't have time for this. Then I suggest... You stop being difficult... and get in. Hi Kerry. Oh, Hello darling. Daddy’s been upsetting people again. Good old Daddy. What have you got for us? Ok. Look Camille... This investor wants to work with you. They really do. They... love the idea of you fronting the campaign, and a business idea. But... you don’t get a say in the designs. Or the fabrics. Or the accessories. So basically they want to use my face and body... To sell the clothes. With our names But we have no input on... Anything. Well with... your name. Certainly. I mean... They are offering great money, Camille. Kerry, it'll be no different from modeling. And they want me to ditch my best friend and partner? No. Yes, well. Take a look at the offer. They don't want me... We’re a package deal. This isn't happening unless we're both involved. Do you really mean that? Yes. Heather, You’re a genius dressmaker. I wouldn’t want to work with anyone else but you. Wait here. White van, Didn’t catch the plates or a face. Could be nothing. It was just parked on the street. Made a speedy getaway. So would I, if I saw you prowling toward me. What are you doing around here? Hey! Just on my way to meet Dad at his lawyer’s office. Who’s suing him now? The fucking world! How's tricks? Fine. I thought you got a killing machine tailing you, too. This is my brother, TJ. So this is the famous killing machine, eh? Nice to meet you, Mr. Sharp. And you. I hear... A certain someone is out of rehab. Funny, the day Sebastian's released... Sharp is hired to protect me. I saw the threat... Can’t be too careful with our little star? What did it say? Who sent it? What it said doesn't matter. If we knew who sent it... don’t you think something would be done about it? Look after our girl. -Bye. -Bye. Any news on the courier. There was no courier that day. He's hiding something. Let’s ask him. No. Don’t give him any reason to believe we’re on his case. Keep digging. I'm going to try these on. Take your time. Sweet. Use the closest cubicle. I prefer the one of the back Don't think I will go back there. Don’t think I care. Camille... Just use this one. These are a yes. Another yes. I’ll be outside. They’re a yes! Hi. Perfume? Jake? Beta-blockers... They stop adrenaline. They control anxiety. Don't feel sorry for me. Why? I don’t deserve it. What happened to you? War. Hi. Thank you. What’s up? Who delivered this? I'm sending something to by courier. Have it checked for fingerprints. How serious is this threat. Threats are normally just that... Threats. Don't worry. I'll keep you safe. I see you found your way to the guess room. Going somewhere? Yes. Have been reassigned. Someone else is on their way to take over. Fine. Is Camille home? Sebastian. What are you doing here? How are you, Cam? He works for my father. Coffee? I don't think so. Come on. Haven’t you missed me? Your contact with Miss Logan stops now. I thought you were leaving. Change of plan. -What the fuck do you want? -Jake! Stay back! He’s paparazzi! He wants a photograph. He doesn't want to hurt me. -Stan, Hi. -Hi, Camille. Mind asking this nice gentleman if he’ll let me go? Yes, I do mind. I’ve known him for years. He's one of the good guys. Get outta here. I'll replace the cameras, Stan. No, you fucking won’t. I love how protective of her you are. Of course I am. I'm paid to protect her. Open your eyes, big man. No. Jake. Jake, I'm meeting my mother and brother for dinner before Saffron's birthday party. Jake? Jake. What the fuck? I'm... Sorry I thought... and... Who's she? None of your business. I'm sorry. I shouldn’t have pried. She's an ex. She's... She's nothing. You should get that. Sharp. There's no sign of a courier to Logan Towers the afternoon the threat arrived. There must be. Have you check the CCTV? -The records? -Yes. Then maybe it was delivered by someone else. Maybe... I could be wrong. I understand. I’ll call with an update as soon as I have one. You look beautiful darling. Little star. See you soon. I'm meeting Heather at the Picturedrome. Let's go. I need to wee. Want to watch? There won't be any danger in there. Then you won't mind if I check then. Will you? Just go. And be quick. Camille. You stupid bitch! You think I'm not good enough for you. Your mine. There’s a Heckler VP9 aimed at your pretty little head. It’s going to make a mess when I blow your fucking brains out. and I’m probably gonna spend the rest of my fucking life in prison. But, I'll go there happily... Knowing that you'll be dead. Please. Jake. Jake. Jake. How did you get your bullet wound?. I was shot in combat. You were in the army. SAS. I was a sniper. And that's why you’re not in the services anymore, because you were wounded? Something like that. How did it happen? Bad judgment. It only happened a few times when we were together. I wouldn’t care if it happened once and he sacrificed his life in apology. I’d find a way to bring him back to life just so I could kill him again. Don’t try to defend him. I’m not telling you to defend him. and... Telling you so don't think I'm pathetic. I don't think that. So what do you think of me? How do you see me Jake? A weak little woman who needs looking after? A spoiled little brat? A materialistic, self-centered female with no appreciation of what it’s like to go without? No! Exactly the opposite! What happened tonight? I beat the shit out of a man who was assaulting you! What do you think I’m going to do? Hold you in place while he gets his aim right? That wasn't the only reason! You were somewhere else! What happened to you? None of your damn business! You are my client! I am your bodyguard! That’s it! Stop trying to figure me out! We can’t do this. It’s wrong. I’m your bodyguard. Your father will make sure that I never work again. I need a purpose, Camille. I need to work. I understand. I don’t want you to understand. So beautiful. Are you okay? Hell, Camille. Lick, Please. Please. You hear me? Perfect. Jake. Go to sleep, Cami. Come back to bed. I’m no good for you, Camille. I'm not staying here forever. Going out for a shoot, Tomorrow. Then we’re staying here until then. -Hi. -Hi. It’s not so bad Let’s get you some makeup and I can work my magic. Thanks, I'll see you in a sec. What's the... Shoot for? Perfume. Clean and minimal by new designer. Minimal... What does that mean? Means I won’t be wearing a lot. You’ve never posed nude. I'm not sure that it's the... Right step... for your career. The design stuff. That's your thing. I'll focus on my design thing. It's a huge campaign for me. Trust me, my career will thank me for it. Camille. Oh, Hi. [Smooching] How are you? Nice trunks! Don’t get too cocky. He he was going to be smaller. I’ve heard you’ve got yourself a bodyguard. Don't you just. Camille. -I'll see you on set. -I'll see you on set. There's a ponce in the sparkly knickers? Do you mean silver trucks? Because Shaun is a model. We’re shooting together. You’ve just told me that you’re going to be wearing next to nothing on this shoot and now you’re telling me Mr. Sparkly Knickers over there is going to be rubbing up against you? -It’s work. -A fucking torture. You’re twitchy today. Is it any wonder? Day three. You should wait for me outside. I’d rather wait in here. [Song Playing] [Song Discontinues] Oh Mother... Fucker! Just stay in. Call. [Grunting] [Song Continues] [Song Fades Away] Handled with class, Jake. [Phone Vibrating] [Phone Vibrating] A minute too late, Lucinda, What have you got? Nothing. Honestly, I’m at a loss. I’ve just spoken to Logan. He’s probably going to pull you. He’s hiding something. Well, If he wants to pull you there’s nothing we can do. I've got another job for you. Not same handsome a fee... but nothing to be sniffed at. Greek diplomat. Put himself into his bullshit bother... Laundering money. I reckon a year in the sun will do you good. A year? It’s a pass. Go well? What was that? That funny little turn? Like I said, a call. Your phone wasn’t ringing. It was on silent. And who was it? A colleague. Updating me on a few... details. And is there anything? Nothing. That's funny because Dad call me earlier told me things he's getting to the bottom of it. He said it should be all sorted by this afternoon. Nothing’s certain. Dad also reminded me It’s Chloe’s birthday this afternoon. We have to be in the country by three. Sounds exciting. Let's get some iced tea. May I help you? Iced lemon tea, a black coffee, and a tuna salad. You're my bodyguard, not my personal caregiver. That's changed. I’ve been thinking. How little I know about you. Nothing much to tell. -Your bullet wound. -No, Camille. Do you have a family? No. My parents died when I was seven. But my grandmother... raised me. She died when I was sixteen. I was old enough to join the forces I did. And the woman? She's irrelevant. Irrelevant enough for you to carry her photograph around? You're still walking, I see. Let me remedy that. Jake, stop! You’re a fucking psycho, man! Fuck! Camille! Camille! Camille's gone. Call Logan. Call the police. I have a found. There’s a CCTV camera on the building opposite the café on Stretton Street. Give me all the footage you have in the last hour. Got it. I've found a note on Camille's Car. It says time's up. The camera opposite the café has been out of order for over a month. Couldn’t get in. I didn't have my keys. Call off the police. And Logan. I've got her. I’ll call you soon. I thought you've been taken. I thought I’d lost you, Camille. Couldn’t watch. Seeing you like that frightened me. I'm so sorry. I saw red, Cami. What he did to you. I… I couldn't bear it. How long have you been a bodyguard? Four years. Why do you do it? To feel useful. Like when you served to your country? I guess so. Why did you stop serving? I’d served my country. Time to move on. Why are you walking away from me? This conversation clearly isn’t going anywhere. I’m not stupid, Jake. There are things you’re not telling me I have to get ready for my stepbrother's party. [Music] Little star! Last to arrive... and I bet you'll be the first to leave. Dad said they may have gotten to the bottom of the threats. Do you know anything? You know I don’t discuss anything I hear within his office walls. Even when it’s about me? Especially when it’s about you. You’ll be free as a bird again very soon, kiddo. Now... Can I say hello... to our delightful stepmother? [Inaudible dialogues] I let my personal emotion compromise my judgment once... when I was in the service. Two of my friends died and I was shot. I was deemed... too volatile... too unstable... to continue my service. The only thing that mattered to me was stripped away... after one bad decision... because I let my personal life affect my duty. I swore I’d never let that happen again in any element of my life, Camille. and I have upheld that promise. Until you. My need to protect you... goes a lot fucking deeper than a well-paid job. Daddy! My little star. Now wait a minute. Charles! Charles! Chloe. I'ld like you to meet this young man Mr. Charles. [Inaudible Dialogues] I think Logan's wife is having an affair. Who is he? On it. Also... Trevor Logan funded Sebastian Peters’s rehab.. One hundred thousand Pounds landed in his account that day he was admitted. Kind of convenient. Nice to meet you. Likewise. We're leaving. what do Pete and Grant want? Maybe Dad’s found out who’s been sending the threats. I don’t think they want to talk about the threats. What do you think your father would do if he found out about us? He’d say no one is good enough for me. Unless it's a business deal to be had. He’d do anything to keep you away. But you are good enough. I don’t think your father will agree, angel. I don't care what he thinks. He's obsessed with controlling everything around him. He will not control me. I have you to look after me now. You have me now. Where are we? My home. You live here? That’s right, angel. It's not what I expected. A bit like you didn’t expect me? Exactly like that. Why have you brought me here? Because I think Daddy might try to have us followed. Have you found anything and Logan's current wife? The man in the photo is Logan's divorce lawyer And from what I can find the affair has been going on for months. and that's not all. I hacked Logan's email. We had his emails. He gave us access. Not to this one. He chose not to give us access to this one. He received an e-mail two days ago. Unknown IP address and account untraceable. He deleted from the server. But... I can tell that it had an attachment. I just can't confirm what it was? I fucking knew it. He is hiding something. and Logan's also just called and terminated your contract. He said the security team is closing in on the source of the threat. I didn't believe him. Neither do I. I'll check in with you tomorrow. [Song Playing] [Song Fades Away] You're mine now. That was a very weary sigh. Just wondering about a few things. Cami, I know what you're wondering. Stay here. Well, this is just fucking perfect. I nearly blew your fucking head off, Lucinda,. I wish you had. Heads will roll, Jake! The whole agency will suffer! Just because you couldn’t keep your cock out of a hole! Any fucking hole! If it has got a pulse and a fucking hole, it’s good to go, right? Lucinda. Cami. If your daddy suspects anything, He’ll have them confirmed soon. "London socialite Camille Logan, daughter of business tycoon Trevor Logan. is always a step ahead." "The leggy blonde, has just taken job perks to a new level. with her tall, dark, handsome bodyguard." That’s you, by the way. -"The pair were spotted—" -Okay! We get it. Do you really? Angel? Has Cruella gone? Yes. Why are you so mad? I don’t want to be just another meaningless fuck, Jake. Look at me. Look at me! I’m not going to tell you that it isn’t true. I’m not proud of it. Those were faceless women, angel. I see you. Jake! You immoral arsehole. I trusted you to keep her safe and you take advantage of her? He didn’t take advantage of me, I'm a grown woman. I have my mind... my own life. Cami, get your clothes on. You’re coming with me. You’ll have to rip me away. Pete! Touch her and I will kill you. Quit while you’re ahead. Sharp. My Camille is too good for you, and you know it. And what about your daughter’s safety? Is that worth compromising because of your pathetic need to control her? Walk away from her, now. And I won't destroy you. Why are you doing this? I want what's best for you. You have no right to dictate who I see... What I do! -Get dressed and I’ll go talk to him. -No. He won't listen. Throw him out. She can go. Jake! You think you can keep me away from Camille with threats? Jake! How much? What's going on? Are you fucking kidding me? You think you can buy me off... like that lowlife drug addict? Get the fuck... out of my apartment. Not without my daughter. Ah, the police. It really was rather brutal what you did to poor Sebastian Peters. You can’t see her if you’re locked up. How much have you paid Sebastian to press charges against me? He... hit her. Your daughter is still in danger and you know it. You aren't telling me everything and I’m going to find out why? You're going to wish... You never met me Logan. Please, Just let me... Please, let me out of here. Jake! Let me out! Where's Jake? Let me take you home my little sister. You'll be safe with me. Who you're keeping me from, Dad? Men you’ve bankrupted? Sebastian? Jake? I’m keeping you safe from it all. He's not good for you. Trust me sweetheart. I only want what's best for you. Alright [Song Playing] Here you go. Camille! Camille! Quick! After her. Camille! Mum... Can you come and get me? [Door Knocking] Come right in here. You led them stright to me. Quit your whining. You let him take her? I didn’t let him take her, The depraved prick paid her scumbag ex-boyfriend... to press charges against me. The police came. I ran. None of this would've happened If you hadn't have become emotionally involved. Enough of this. Oh, for fuck's sake. Does she know? She knows I was in the SAS. She knows there was another woman... and that personal emotion had me relieved of duty. But does she know? Camille’s still out there in danger, Luce. I need to find out what's going on. Then we will. You look like a homeless stray! Oh. Camille! Now, now, sweetie pie. Has this got anything to do with that... strapping man who was photographed carrying you out of The Picturedrome? Dad hired him as a bodyguard. Dad received a threat. He receives those weekly, darling. No, This was directed to me. Jake and I... We got close, And now, Dad is doing everything to keep us apart. Why? Because he is a narcissistic control freak. Why did you marry him? I was young. Plus TJ was just a boy, his mother was gone. Your father... forced the poor girl back to Russia. Someone needed to instill some humanity into him... before he turned into his father completely. What am I going to do? Well, before you do anything... you’re gonna clean yourself up. I'll have some clothes bought for you. I’ll always find you, angel. Does your father know you’re here? No! I ran away. I thought you gave me. Never. Camille. Sweetie pie! Mum. Hi. Mum, this is Jake, So you’re the man who has been causing all this trouble? I’m trying not to. But her father doesn't seem to keen. You could be Prince Harry and he still wouldn’t approve. Why don’t you get yourself dressed, sweetie pie? I’ll take Jake into the lounge. We’ll have tea. Jake? You okay? Jake, What’s the matter? I... I love you. I love you so fucking much and I need you to know that. I love you, too. How did you get into my house? Did you know that your ex-husband paid off Cami’s ex-boyfriend and funded his rehab? Does Camille know? I haven’t told her yet. There’s a lot I need to figure out. Like what? Like the true threat to your daughter. Something wasn’t sitting right from the day Logan hired me. He kept information from me and when I questioned him... He pulled me from the protection. I don’t think his disapproval of my relationship with Cami is the only reason that he wants me gone. He’s hiding something, and I intend to find out what it is. She’ll be safe with me until then. I have no doubt. My nearest neighbor is fifteen miles away. Sociable. I didn't have you down as the farmer type.. So what about the stables and the fields? It was the most isolated place I could find. Why would you need to be isolated? Because I knew that one day I would meet a beautiful Princess... We needed protecting from a wicked father. For tonight we forget everything and be together. I’m taking you out for dinner. Where? Let me worry about that. Make yourself at home. I love you. Snap! Jake. Jake. "Take this paper and for the instructions." "Head across the driveway." "There’s a gap between two oak trees." "Follow the trail until you reach the huge trunk of a fallen tree." "Your next instruction is there." "Jake." "One day" "I’m going to fuck you on this ancient tree trunk." "Look to your right." "There’s a silver birch." "Pass it and follow the new path until you reach a red rosebush." "You’ll find your next instruction there." "Watch the thorns." "Jake." "This place is my safe haven." "Now it’s yours, too." "Everything I have is yours." "I love you." "More than I ever imagined I could love someone." "Take a Rose and follow the trail until you find the beautiful red Acer tree" "Jake." "Your Clothes." "Take them off." "Take everything off." "There’s an opening past this Acer tree that will lead you to me." "Hurry." "Jake." You found me. I always will . A picnic ?

What did you say? Yes. I want to marry you. I’ll marry you. Right now if I could. You've taken every manly piece of me, Pulverized it. I flat-refused, This job when Lucinda first e-mailed me the details. I prided myself on being impenetrable. No one got close. I wouldn’t let them. But you… You changed... all that. You’ve found me, Despite the fact that I never wanted to be found. You’re the missing piece I didn't know I wasn’t looking for, angel. And now I’m scared... ... of being incomplete again. I don't even have a ring. I don't need one. Draw one on. Draw one on. It's... beautiful. I’ll never take it off. I love you, Jake Sharp. I love you so much. Snap. [Phone Vibrating] I've to take this. Logan’s wife has filed for divorce. Something tells me he’ll need another lawyer soon. I'm kind of seeing him tomorrow. I don't plan on leaving his office until he tells me what's going on. And what about the police and the fact that they want your arse? He’s rectifying that little issue for me. and I’ve asked Cami to marry me. Sorry, you've done what now? You heard. - And what about... - I called Abbie. There's something I need you to do for me. I need you to take care of Cami when I'm back in town. I'm not a babysitter, Jake. That's your job, remember? You’re the only person that I trust, Luce. Don't be a bitch about it. Fine! Thanks. Sebastian is dropping the charges. I'm not going to shoot your father, angel. I've carried a loaded weapon every time I've met your father. I've managed not to shoot him so far. Not funny. Find a ring on the Internet. Plan where you want to marry me... When... and who you want there, angel. Hey, big man. Afternoon. I love how he pulls off the broody sexy persona with such ease. No disrespect but your dad is being an arsehole, He’s on wife number three! I mean, What position is he in to pass judgment on what love is? You know. If your dad didn't upset so many people he wouldn't have got that threat made against you and he wouldn't have hired Jake to protect you. The irony really is... quite beautiful. What’s on your finger? Is that a penned-on engagement ring? It was a joke. Cami... has he asked you to marry him? Yes. What have you got to say? Well, apart from the fact that he should have bought you an actual ring? Yes. Oh my God! Oh my God, Cami! Tell me I'm going to be your maid of honor. Tell me the budget is colossal. Tell me we can have the hen party in St. Tropez! Yeah. [Phone Vibrating] My little star! The last thing that I wanted to do was hurt you. Dad, I love him. I know it's a shock for you. but he’s... He's a good man. I need to make you understand. He has a wife Camille. Darling, he's married. How do you know that the. The bastard has been lying to you all along. Where’s Jake? He said he was coming to see you. I had Grant follow him. He's at her house now. You’re lying. You have no idea where he is. The address is 18A, First Street. Cami. Camille. Wha... What’s going on? Why are you holding a frying pan? That woman out there, Lucinda. She works with Jake. Dad has just told me Jake has a wife. Do you believe him? He makes sense. He's not stupid. He wouldn't make this up. And what are you going to do with that? I’m going to knock out my replacement bodyguard. You're going to go out there and tell her that I'm coming out the window I can do that. She barrels in... I'm going to whack her over the head. Fabulous. I only came over for wine and a chat. Come. Okay. Lucinda... Lucinda! You've gotta come. Cami has climbed out of the window. I don't know what she's dong She's just... Legged her out there She's going down the street. Can you see? Oh yeah. There she is. She must've gone. Should I get a drink? [Car Door Opens] [Car Door Closes] [Door Knocking] Come in. Thanks. [Door Closes] Please sit. Tea? How have you been? Alive. I can see that. Why are you here, Jake? After all these years? I met someone. i can't move on in my life with all these... regrets hanging around my neck. I love this woman. I need to tell her... Everything there is to know about me. I can’t have a life with her without that. It would be a lie. as long as you're okay. As long as you have peace and you can get on with your life, Jake. I haven't been able to move on with my life for four years, Abbie! You’re not the only one who couldn't get on with their life. I’ve been raising your daughter on my own. I’m going to make things right. Daddy? Charlotte, darling. I told you to stay in your room and play. But, he looks like my daddy. There’s a lady at the door. Cami. Cami. Stay away from me. Please. Shit. Cami! Stay away from me, Jake! Just, let me explain. You've lied to me. You're married. You have a daughter. I was married. Not anymore. She's dead, Camille. My wife is fucking dead. That woman... is my wife's sister. I came back early from tour, and I found my wife in bed with my best friend. I walked out. My wife... Came after me She chased after me in her car. The Bus... Hit her. She died. Oh My God. She had a child. While I was on tour. I told myself... Child wasn't mine. I went back to war. I felt that was the only thing that I left. I lost, All sense of respect... For my own safety. For the safety of others. I didn't want to be alive anymore. Being alive felt like a form of... Continuous Torture. And then met you. Why didn't you tell me? I turned into a hateful, bitter bastard, Camille. My daughter... She's better off without me. I didn’t want to poison her with my darkness. Nothing... about the time that we spent together... has been a lie. Camille! You have ten seconds to tell me what you've been hiding before I blow your fucking brains out. -Whare's Cami? What have you done with her? -She's been fucking taken! Fucking talk. -Alright. They've been blackmailing me for weeks. Said they’d expose me if I didn’t pay! -Expose you how? Leave us. They have photos of me. -Of me and a girl. -How old? -15. I didn't know I thought she was at least 20. You bastard. This can’t get out! You pulled me from Camille's protection knowing she wasn’t safe! What the fuck were you thinking? You were digging! I couldn't let you see the real threat I received because it talks about the pictures of me and the girl. Who could've known what you're up to in your spare time? Don't push me Logan. In the safe. Get them out. Move! Speak. I just found this image on the site. See the Van. See the face. Run a face check. Already done. His name is Michael Scott.

One of his parole conditions is to check in weekly with his parole officer in Shoreditch. Today’s check-in day. If he’s following his parole conditions, he should be there now. I'm sending you the address. Do you know this man? No. I’ve never seen him before. Who is he? Someone hired this man to take your daughter. Pray she’s unharmed, Logan. Pray real hard. I’ll always find you, angel. Okay I'm just going to see the doctor. Gets some rest. I'll call you later. I have something. Go on. It seems that Scott shared a cell with a Vladimir Sochinsky. Sochinsky? That was the maiden name of my first wife. TJ's mother. Vladimir was her brother. Oh, you’re safe! Jesus, Cami, I’ve been so worried. Where have you been? How did you know Cami was missing? Dad called me. -Jake, Stop. -Don’t you dare... -Start throwing accusations around! -No. TJ is loyal through and through! Forgive me, but I have little faith in the integrity of your family. What? Wha... Is someone suggesting I’d kidnap my own sister for a ransom from my own father? -Because, The man that took her, shared a cell with your uncle. -My uncle? He’s also been blackmailing your father. My mom tried to connect with me. I told her I was fine. When was that? Maybe three months. The first threat. Three months ago. Unknown number.
