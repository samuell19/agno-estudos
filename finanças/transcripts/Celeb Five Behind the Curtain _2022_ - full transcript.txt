Let's do this. Guys. We aren't here to beat Squid Game. WE AREN'T HERE TO BEAT SQUID GAME Don't feel pressured. Are you ready? I give you… THE STORY THAT CAME BEFORE CELEB FIVE'S PERFORMANCE SANGAM-DONG, SEOUL Hey, Shin-young. Yes. I'm down in the parking lot. Come on down. CELEB FIVE'S VETERAN SONG EUN-I - Hey, Shin-young. - Hey, Eun-i. This is infection prevention. CELEB FIVE'S CAPTAIN KIM SHIN-YOUNG - Why is she coming this way? - Sit in the back. I am here. I should bow to my senior comedians. CELEB FIVE'S STRIKER AN YOUNG-MI - Shall we hit the road? - Yes, we should. - Let's go. - Let's go. Let's go. Bong-seon should be done with her gig by now. - Bong-seon? - Yes. Bong-seon should be somewhere around here. Around here? - Eun-i. - Bong-seon, where are you? I'm in front of Yankee Candle. I've been standing here for a while. I don't see you. What do you mean? I'm in the middle of the sidewalk. - In the middle of the sidewalk? - Where? Yes. Where are you? When will you get here? - We don't see you. - Wave your hand. I think you just drove past me. Your car's license plate number is 3462! The white one. - Wave your hand. - Hold on. She did see the van. I waved my hand. Why did you drive past me? We didn't see you. I know the exact location you were talking about, but I didn't see you there. I'm under a sign that says "bargain sale." The bargain sale sign across from Starbucks. - Hold on. Is that her? - Hold on. What? - My goodness. - Is that her? - Wait. Is that Bong-seon under the sign? - My goodness. BARGAIN SALE WILL PEOPLE GET A BARGAIN SALE IF THEY FIND HER? CELEB FIVE'S NUTCASE SHIN BONG-SEON This is insane. Hold on. People are staring at you. That's you under the sign, right? Someone is talking to you. Hold on. Be nice to her. - Eun-i. - My goodness. - Bong-seon, we're here. - There? - We're here. Hurry up. - Here. - Cross the road. - Goodbye. - Use the crosswalk. - Cross the road. Look at her. Here she comes. MY LEGS GET ME OUT OF HERE There goes the walking Yankee Candle. SUPERSIZE WALKING CANDLE It's a red light. Stop. Cross the road. - She swept all the leaves. - I know. She should receive an appreciation plaque. I AM NOT A WEIRDO This is insane. Bong-seon, walk now. - Cross the road. - Cross the road. We have to tell her since she can't see. Cross the road. THE RUNNING RED LIGHT Bong-seon. Bong-seon. - I'm coming. - She's the best. Okay. She's here. - Open the door for her. - Okay. - My goodness. - My goodness. - For goodness' sake. - Good work. Good work. Get in. My goodness. - We circled around three times. - Seriously. - Thank you. - We didn't know. Let's go. - Are you ready? - Yes. Let's go. Let's hit the road. It's my first time feeling lonely around you guys. I'm happy to meet up with you guys when the weather is so nice, but what is this for? - This? - Aren't we going to hang out? - That's right. - Are we? - Yes. - We're going to have a meeting. - What? - Why? I got an offer from Netflix to do a show about Celeb Five. - Netflix? - Netflix? Netflix? - You're lying. - For real? - For real. - The one that made Squid Game? - Yes. - The intro sound goes, "Tudum." Right. - You're lying. - That's utter nonsense. I subscribe to Netflix. CELEB FIVE There they are. The scriptwriters are here. We only just heard this news. - But you want a meeting now? - Seriously. - My goodness. - You guys… - This is ridiculous. - Things are moving too fast. We've already discussed it. - We didn't even say yes yet. - I know. We are doing it. It's been decided. Sit down. - For goodness' sake. - This is an unfair contract. - Seriously. - Hurry up, Bong-seon. I mean, we are jumping into the meeting for a Netflix show just like this? The drinks are ready. We'll be working with them. - You know them. We're close. - Right. We haven't decided if we want to do a Netflix show, so… I told you we're doing it. What are you talking about? It's been decided. - So it's been decided. - Let me knock some sense into her. So it has been decided. I am a bit excited because this is our first time reaching - an international audience. - I know. This is our first time headlining a show. - That's right. - When we first made Celeb Five, you said… I said I'd treat you to steak in New York. Yes. This will be a stepping stone. I'll tell you something. Squid Game is a K-drama. K-pop is a sensation everywhere. - It's time for K-comedy. - You're right. - It's our turn. - Right. If we do stand-up comedy, we could talk about such things. That's right. A few Korean comedians did stand-up comedy - with Netflix a few times. - Yes. But since there are four of us, I don't know how it will be. We don't know what the topic will be, - so have to talk. - We should share fun stories and then decide on the format of the show. How far can we go on a Netflix show? - Is there censorship? - Don't worry about it for now. We don't know how far we can go. Perhaps we're being too careful. You can be the first one. - Should we do it? - Yes. - Should we? - Really? I've watched some Netflix series. They're quite explicit. Maybe you only watch such series. - Hey. - Too Hot To Handle. You know, algorithms provide personalized recommendations. Think about Too Hot To Handle, 365 Days, - Sex/Life, and so on. - Come on. We should do the same. - Otherwise… - So you want something mature. That's right. We should break free from our barriers. Who will provide mature content? - Who will do that? - I will. I will. You tend to do badly under the spotlight. How will you do it? - Go ahead. - Green light, red light You'll get shot if you do that. SEXY SQUID GAME - Stop it. - What's with you? Stop it. It's time to show the world K-breasts. - Here's the thing. - K… Foreigners underestimate us, okay? They think our breasts are… Don't get worked up. Not even Netflix can accept your breasts. Do you want to get edited out? Which country will accept me? - When the actual shoot begins, - You have passion. She won't be able to do it. - She can't do it under the spotlight. - No. - I am like that. - She is timid. Stories of Shin-young's grandma are funny. Here's the thing. Whenever she tells us those stories, we always laugh. Shin-young's grandma is super healthy. My grandma is 110 years old. Korean grandmas are like this. Let's say you've bought something for her. "Grandma, try this." "My goodness, I can't believe you came all the way here." "My goodness, my baby." "I can't believe you came all the way here." "I should kick the bucket to stop inconveniencing you." - "Grandma, don't say that." - "Forget it. I should kick the bucket." - "Gosh, what is this?" - "It's a mask." "Gosh, what is this?" - I always get her red ginseng. - Red ginseng. "My goodness, it's red ginseng. It's red ginseng!" "You shouldn't have rinsed it!" SHE IS WORRIED ABOUT THE RED GINSENG - That was sudden. - "Water ruins its health benefits!" "But there was dirt on it." "You need to eat the dirt to receive the energy." "You utter fool!" Just a moment ago, she was saying, "I should kick the bucket next year." I told you that she is two-faced. - That is so true. - She is so funny. "Shin-young, I always forget who you are." "How many brothers and sisters do you have?" "Who was your dad?" - She forgets my name. - She has many grandchildren. "How many siblings? I forgot." "I don't remember the numbers anymore." "I became a fool since it's my time to go to the heavens." She always says that. "Grandma, I recently got paid. Let me send you an allowance." "I don't need an allowance from a child." - "Use it to buy a house." - Grandmas are like that. "You don't need to give me money." "I don't like it when you guys do that, okay?" "What's your account number? I'll send you some." Ask me. "What's your account number? I'll send money." "For goodness' sake. Just use it for yourself." "Come on. What's your account number?" "Nonghyup Bank 439-3400-0780." "Say the numbers back to me." - "You said 449…" - "I said 4390!" "It's 4390?" "After 4390 comes a space." "Then it's 7305. That's the best way to memorize it." - She seriously does that. - She checks. She checks. I told you that Korean grandmas are two-faced. My mom and dad bickered regularly. They did get along pretty well, but… - But… - It's the way they talk. - The way they talk. - You know, my mom cherished her belongings a great deal. But she threw away Dad's belongings haphazardly. SHE ONLY CHERISHED HER BELONGINGS You know what I mean, right? - That's right. - Yes. My mom is like that too. Although she bickered with my dad, she didn't send him to a nursing home until right before he passed away. He didn't want to go to a nursing home. On some days, he felt happy. On some days, he felt depressed. I guess he felt depressed one day. He said to my mom, "Hoya! Hoya!" It sounds like a pet name. My mom was doing the dishes. "What? What do you want?" "Where's the pesticide?" He asked. - I see. - "Why do you need pesticide?" "I'm going to kill myself." - Your dad said that. - He was ill for a long time. And my mom said, "It should be on the rooftop." - She told him so nonchalantly. - Seriously. "It should be on the rooftop." I was like, "What?" - My dad went, - It's like Modern Family. "That one won't work. It's too old." It's a black comedy. - It's a black comedy. - Yes. - That was funny. - It had pathos. It had pathos. - Will it be okay for Netflix? - Will it be okay? Pesticide exists all over the world. - Yes. - What is it in English? Farmer's… Medipharm? Eun-i, you need to get going. - Me? - Yes. - I have a shoot. - You have a shoot. - Yes. - Let's keep throwing in ideas. Yes. It'll get us somewhere. - Brainstorm some more. - Okay. - Us? Okay. - Yes. - I need to go, but you have time. - Yes. See you later. We only have a month. - Okay. Take care. - See you later. - Work hard. - Good luck. - Let's go. - Okay. We'll get going now. Thank you. THE REST THINK, "WE STILL HAVE A LOT OF TIME, RIGHT?" - How about some beer? - I'm good. THE FIRST NETFLIX MEETING EUN-I'S MEETING SHIN-YOUNG'S RADIO SHOW EMERGENCY VIDEO MEETING Is this better? Like this? Oh, this is better. All set. A SUDDEN VIDEO MEETING What time is it? Why aren't they joining the meeting? EUN-I: LET'S HAVE A MEETING TODAY SHIN-YOUNG: WHAT TIME? BONG-SEON: I'M OUTSIDE IT WON'T TAKE LONG HERE'S THE INVITATION LINK BONG-SEON: OKIE-DOKIE SHIN-YOUNG: OKAY Oh, it's Bong-seon. My goodness. Eun-i. - Are you outside? - This is amazing. - What? - Are you outside? I'm walking Yanggaeng right now. - I see. - Yanggaeng, say hello to Grandma. - Say hello to Grandma. - Yanggaeng, it's Grandma. - It's Grandma. - It's Grandma. - Hello, Yanggaeng. - It's Grandma. - It's Grandma. Grandma. - Yanggaeng, it's Grandma. Bong… Bong-seon. Bong-seon. What? Bong-seon. Hello? Can you hear me? - Yes, I can hear you. - Bong-seon. I was talking. Didn't you hear me? I didn't hear a thing you said. The video keeps lagging. There is connection, but… - It's Shin-young. - I'll see what I can do. You joined us. Go ahead and talk. What? THE VIDEO MEETING HITS A ROADBLOCK Oh, turn on your audio. - Shin-young. - Eun-i. Eun-i, can you hear me? I can hear you well. - Really? - Yes. - It's all good now, then. - No. I can hear you because you called me. Turn on your audio. You need audio to have a meeting. So turn on the audio. - Young-mi. - All right. I'll hang up now. Okay. Young-mi. Young-mi, where are you? - Me? - Where are you? I'm in the bathtub. OH, NO A BATHTUB… Why are you in the bathtub? We're having a meeting. It's just us. Who cares? It echoes in there. Come out of the bathroom. Come on. We are bust friends. Come out of the bathroom. You can't have a meeting like that. Right now? No! - Do you want me to come out? - Go down. No, no. Young-mi. No. Do you want me to come out? No. I mean… Isn't there a better place for a video meeting? - Eun-i. - I can move now. - Eun-i. - No, no! The connection is really… Young-mi. Young-mi? Yes, Shin-young. Eun-i, can you hear me? Yes, I can. - That solves the problem. - No. Can't I have a video meeting here? Get dressed first. How do I leave the meeting? - Point the camera upwards. - I don't know how to leave the meeting. Up? - Point it upwards. - Up? No! Not your breasts! What does she want me to do? Eun-i, I think I'm set now. A NAKED BODY CRASHED THE VIDEO MEETING Eun-i, what should I point upwards? - Let's just meet up. - What? Let's meet up. EUN-I LEFT THE MEETING Eun-i, you're the one who's busy. YOUNG-MI LEFT THE MEETING Eun-i, can you see me? I'm… LET'S MEET UP SOME OTHER TIME EMERGENCY VIDEO MEETING CELEB FIVE'S GIG - It's cold. - The human world is cold. - Go in. - It must be a popular restaurant. It is a popular place. - It's cold. - Hello. I'm glad the gig went well. It's cold. - Hello. - Hello. - What would you like? - A large gamjatang, please. - Okay. - Give us a lot of meat. Okay. - You must be very hungry. - It's just so cold. We haven't finished planning. Shall we talk about ideas while we eat? SICK AND TIRED SONG EUN-I, A 50-YEAR-OLD WORKAHOLIC Eun-i, we're here to have tasty food. You should stop worrying. - We just finished the gig. - Right. We just finished it. Don't talk about work during a meal. - We aren't ready for Netflix. - Every day, - you think about Netflix. - I think she's been such a worrywart ever since she accepted the offer for the Netflix show. It's so stressful. - Look at these seeds. - Seriously. Say it like a swear word. Gosh, it's spicy. These damn chili pepper seeds. - Tap the seeds from it. - Yes. Do it. - I can't eat it. - "I can't eat it." It's too spicy. Let's eat first. Give me your bowl. I'll tie my hair with a mask. I am Steven Seagal. SHE BECOMES STEVEN SEAGAL Mr. Seagal, where did our fairy go? I don't give a damn. It looks delicious. Gamjatang should be eaten like this. LOOKING FOR THE RIGHT TIME Haven't you guys done any other gigs? All comedians do those gigs at nightclubs and regional festivals. We are the last comedians who have done those gigs. - Yes. - We are the last comedians. - You did a lot of gigs. - Yes, I did. Shin-young was good at it. This is how gigs at a nightclub went. When I appeared on the stage, people would start buzzing. "It's Kim Shin-young!" When they were buzzing, I'd go, "Ta-da!" "The spirit of Suwon!" "Let me see it!" "Men say, 'Ho!' Women say, 'Ha!'" "Ho! Ha! Ho! Ha!" You need to get them excited. - Then you party with them. - You party with them. "Jump, jump!" After jumping four times, I'd go, "People in Suwon are insane!" People went nuts. She's done a lot of gigs. I have. When I was in the comedy skit Bro, gigs in Gyeongsang Province were so easy. "Bro! Where is he? He is here." - I just had to do that. - They loved it. But for gigs in Jeolla Province, I was often asked to tweak it a little. "Bruh! Where is he? He is here." I tweaked it a bit. There was another version for religious gigs. - You did those too? - How did it go? - I had a buzz cut for Bro. - Yes. Because of that, I scored a gig at a Buddhist event. There, I went, "Venerable Sir! Where is he?" "You will see him if you cultivate morality." - What? - What? "If you cultivate morality." - "If you cultivate morality." - Yes. At a church event, I went, "My Lord! Where is he? He is always in my heart." - My goodness. - There were different versions. - I worked hard. - You customized the catchphrase. I customized the catchphrase. STORIES ABOUT SHIN-YOUNG'S GIGS GREAT! We should do the same for "I Wish I Could Unsee That." We always wear the same outfits for performances. So we should change the song. - Yes. We should customize it. - That's right. There should be - an EDM version. - That's right. I wish I could unsee that, that, that UPBEAT ARRANGEMENT There you go. - Then… - "At this rate, we'll all die!" Number 456! Green! Light! Red light! Breasts machine gun. GOSH, I WISH I COULD UNSEE THAT What do you think, Eun-i? Don't you like it? - It isn't her style. - No, it isn't. You should consider this. Once we pretend to shoot, - people will scream and do this. - That's right. - I did that automatically just now. - That's right. - It's for gigs. - It's for gigs. - Let's make an EDM version. - Yes. - Let's mix in our catchphrases. - Yes. I wish I could unsee that, that, that - Go! - "What nonsense are you spouting?" SHE ADDS HER OLD CATCHPHRASE! I wish, wish, wish I could unsee that "You should be honored, you plebs." "Where are my friends? They're here." - Say your catchphrase. - Eun-i. SHE DOESN'T HAVE A CATCHPHRASE SHE DEBUTED 30 YEARS AGO - Eun-i, these damn chili pepper seeds. - I have none. "I'm upset" is your catchphrase. The music will be upbeat… - "I'm upset." - It doesn't suit the mood. It kills the mood. - Seriously. - In remix songs, they add sound effects to keep the song upbeat. Upset Upset SOUND EFFECTS I'm upset! - You're good. - Try it. - That was fun. - How does it go? - "I'm upset." - Upset - She will add the sound effect. - Come on! When do I say it? - Just say, "Upset." - "Upset." - "Upset." - Grandma, say, "Upset." These damn chili pepper seeds. SHE WASN'T SWEARING - What should I do? - Look at these seeds. - For goodness' sake. - When should I say it? This is taking too long. Forget it. I don't understand modern club music. Eun-i, how will you make a Netflix show - when you're so old-fashioned? - I know. - How will you make a hip show? - Clubs aren't the same. Eun-i would be good at the cheerleading version. - That's right. That's a good idea. - That's right. It will go like this. Everything about you I wish I could unsee that I wish I could unsee that A hug at Aewol-eup, Jeju Island Way to go! - Way to go! - Way to go! - Way to go! - Way to go! - Way to go! - Way to go! Ma'am, I'm sorry. - Sorry about this. - Sorry about this. You would look funny from the back. - Show us. - From the back… - Let's do this. - Show us. - I wish I could unsee that - I wish I could unsee that - Hold on. - Way to go! PANDEMIC GIVE US BACK OUR GET-TOGETHERS I wish I could unsee that - Seriously. - Matching pajamas While I was dancing, - an old man outside… - Did people see you? He looked at us like this. That's so funny. Since I became a member of Celeb Five, I've become sociable. - Really? - Yes. - I'm really bad at gigs. - I see. Did you even do any? When I was a university student, I part-timed as a chorus member. - A chorus member? - Yes. I was a freshman back then. I performed at a military camp in a tube dress. - The song was "Pink Lipstick." - I see. During the performance, the soldiers didn't look at the singer. They looked at me and cheered. Maybe you were their type. I continued to perform excitedly, but something felt off. My bra was sliding down. It looked as if I had four breasts. - It was a disaster. - I suddenly had four breasts. To pull up the bra, I turned around. The military band… THE MILITARY BAND GOT AN EYEFUL You did a 360-degree turn. You showed everyone. THAT WAS WHY THEY WERE SO EXCITED - That's dizzying. - I know. - That's dizzying. - I know. - Eun-i, have you done night shows? - Didn't you make a lot of money from them? - It was the heyday. - That's right. I did a lot of those shows. The first show I did was at a sexy nightclub in Bucheon. There was Kkotbun's Mom. - Kkotbun's Mom? - Kkotbun's Mom was a woman - who did snake shows. - That's right. - They existed back in the day. - They were sexy shows. - Was she married? Was Kkotbun her kid? - No. Kkotbun was her snake. Oh, the snake? That name doesn't suit a snake. - The snake must have been this big. - I can't imagine - a snake named Kkotbun. - Seriously. It was a very big snake without any fangs. And it'd never bite people. - It was for show. - I see. That day, she put Kkotbun on a chair - and left to do something else. - Okay. - "Kkotbun's Mom, get ready." - "Okay." - It was her turn to perform. - Right, it was time. "All right." - "Kkotbun!" - Why? "What happened to Kkotbun?" - What happened? - "Oh, no. Kkotbun." "Kkotbun." Kkotbun was supposed to move like this, right? "Kkotbun!" "Kkotbun!" - What happened to Kkotbun? - What happened? - Someone had sat on Kkotbun. - Oh, no. Oh, no! Poor Kkotbun. "What should I do?" "Come on out!" - "Kkotbun's Mom, come on out." - "Hurry up." "Kkotbun." "Kkotbun's Mom." She put the snake around her shoulders. "Kkotbun's Mom, come on out." SHE PUT THE SNAKE AROUND HER SHOULDERS SHE WAS A PROFESSIONAL - Kkotbun was unconscious. - She put the snake around her shoulders. She and I were close, so I went, "What are you going to do?" "My poor Kkotbun." She couldn't even hear me. - She took the stage. - "Take the stage." I was really curious so I watched. - It was showtime. - Music was playing. People cheered upon seeing the snake. - "It's a snake!" - "It's so big!" KKOTBUN'S MOM HAD A SOLUTION She used her muscles. She used her muscles. - Was she popping? - She used her muscles. - She used her muscles. - She made the snake look alive. SHE WAS A PROFESSIONAL She made the snake look alive. As if it was moving. - Oh, no. - She put on a show that way. That's incredible. We should learn from her. - And Kkotbun? - Did it wake up? - No, it never woke up. - Oh, no. Such shows would never happen now. - Back in the day, such shows were common. - Right. Back in the day, at clubs, there were dancers whose job was to make people more excited. - There were poles. - Pole dance? I'll be the pole. - You? - Yes. They grabbed the pole and danced to the music. Their eyes were always fixed. That's dreamy. That's dreamy. - They danced like this. - You're good at it. - Really? - Better than I expected. Anyway, one shift lasted 15 minutes. - Okay. - They took turns every 15 minutes. So they wore a watch upside down - to check the time secretly. - Of course. They couldn't do it overtly. - The shift had to end exactly on time. - I see. - It's hard work. - The dancers were sensitive about it. THE END OF THE SHIFT IS NEAR BUT THE NEXT DANCER IS NOWHERE IN SIGHT - She checked the watch. - She checked it once. GLANCING OVER - Her shift is over. - The next dancer isn't here. - She gave a signal. - "Where is the next dancer?" There was an employee who managed dancers' schedules. When she met his eyes… SEND OUT THE NEXT DANCER, WILL YOU? "Look at the time." She's angry. Her shift is over. She's angry. She kept swearing with her eyes. People had no idea since they were focused on the music, but I noticed since I watched her closely. It was so funny. She was angry. - I miss Kkotbun's Mom. - That's K-performance. - K-performance. - The origin of K-performance. What we have isn't very spectacular for a K-performance. - Our performance is homely. - Yes. I watch various shows on Netflix. There are gunfights and sword fights, but no verbal fights. Verbal fights don't last long. So I think it will be interesting to show Korean grandmas' verbal fights. My grandma never lost. Is your grandma famous in her neighborhood? She is a thug. I am not joking when I say this. My grandma has a verbal blow that ends all fights. - How does it go? - For example. Go ahead and yell at me. "You're the one who caused this!" "What are you saying?" "You told me earlier that you did it!" "Don't be ridiculous." - "You told me earlier!" - "Forget it." "Your breath smells like poop! For goodness' sake." "Don't your children give you toothpaste?" I know we're just acting it out, but I'm offended. Even I feel ashamed. You get in someone's face when you fight. - That's right. - It makes you feel shabby. It makes you feel small. There is another one. It's a reaction. - What? - A countryside grandma's reaction. "You shouldn't live that way." "What did I do? I am fine living this way, okay?" "You are unbelievable." "I am fine living this way, okay?" "You are unbelievable." - "What are you saying?" - "What?" "All of my children are living successfully in Seoul." - "Oyo. Oyo. Oyo." - "You are no better than me, okay?" - "Oyoyo. Oyoyo." - "Oyoyo"? You can't respond to that. When grandmas get in a heated argument and become flustered, - they suddenly make that sound. - I almost teared up. Right? Oyoyo. - "Get lost." - "Oyoyo." - "Oyoyo." - "Look. I told you not to put it here." "Why do you keep doing that? I told you multiple times." - "Your breath smells like poop!" - "Poop or not, you should listen to me." "I told you multiple times not to put it here." SHE DEFENDS HERSELF WITH "OYOYO" "Oyo. Oyo. Oyo. Oyoyo." It makes you lose your will to fight. - You ran out - Seriously. - Of retorts. - That's right. - But you are angry and upset. - Yes. GRANDMA, I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL - That's right. - Grandmas make that sound. I think it could be used around the world. Seriously. Shin-young also has a knack for imitating boat owners. Boat owners. - Boat owners… - You resemble so many people. - Why do I resemble men? - Seriously. Boat owner oppas have a way with words. - Let's say a celebrity wants a ride. - I'm a customer. You're the customer. - "Come for a ride." - "Hello." "Gosh, I can't believe it." - "Today must be my lucky day." - That's creepy. - "You are so pretty." - It's so real. - "I can't believe it." - "Thank you." "Gosh, your beauty is worth a lot of won." "100 million won, 200 million won. You won my heart." That's so annoying. "Get on the boat." "Would you give me a banana boat ride?" "I will give you a crazy ride." - "Please make it long." - "Please make it long." - "How long do you want it to be?" - "How long is a usual ride?" "It's ten minutes." - "About 15 minutes." - "About 20 minutes." "Gosh, 20 minutes?" "It's expensive to keep the motor going." "You guys look like celebrities." "Do you know us?" - "Of course." - "We are idols." "Did you say idiots?" "I'm sorry." "100 million won, 200 million won. You won my heart." - "Thank you." - "Let me take a photo." "I'm sorry, but that's…" - "Why?" - "We aren't wearing makeup." "I won't upload it anywhere. I just want one photo." - "I'm sorry." - "Come on." "I will put it above my head." Did you see the heart? - Did you see the heart? - "I will put it above my head." - "Don't upload it anywhere." - "We don't have much time." "Okay. Aren't you hungry?" - "Yes." - "Hold on. Hello? Dakgalbi? Yes." "Three people are headed there." - "Dakgalbi?" - "They are Song Eun-i, An Young-mi, and Shin Bong-seon." You usually end up going to the inn his friend runs. That's right. "How many are you? Three? Four?" - "We weren't going to stay the night." - "That's crazy." "Hello? Is this the inn?" "Yes. They're my sisters." ANYONE CAN BECOME HIS FAMILY "Take good care of them." "But we first met today." "I take care of my family." "Okay. That sounds good." "Since you sent us, will we get free food at the dakgalbi restaurant?" "You'll see when you get there." - "Shall we say that you sent us?" - "What should we say?" "Tell them your oppa sent you." - "My oppa?" - "My oppa?" "You are old enough to be our uncle." "Don't be ridiculous." "I only got married twice." - "I only got married twice." - That's creepy. "I'm single now." - You sound just like him. - "I'm single now." - I've seen people like this. - Me too. - Her imitation is uncanny. - I know. - The words ping-pong endlessly. - Yes. - They never get stuck. - Seriously. - Her imitation was uncanny. - Then - will the translation be "Boat brother"? - Yes. - Why are you worrying about that? - For goodness' sake. Netflix will take care of subtitles. I'm worried. It was really funny, but I thought, - "Would it be funny to foreigners too?" - Stop it. - Let's go with what we have. - Okay. Let's make a comedy show with the ideas we have. - Yes. - We're set. - We got this. - We need to fry rice. The entire world will laugh. - That's right. - Please give us some rice. EUN-I'S MEETING, YOUNG-MI'S RADIO SHOW, SHIN-YOUNG'S RADIO SHOW EUN-I: IS EVERYONE ASLEEP? SHIN-YOUNG: WHAT IS IT? EUN-I: THE SHOOT IS IN 5 DAYS BONG-SEON: ARE YOU NERVOUS?

BONG-SEON: I'M OUT OF STORIES SHIN-YOUNG: WE'LL FIND A WAY CELEB FIVE'S VARIETY SHOW SHOOT Thank you. - Thank you. - Thank you for your hard work. - Thank you. - Thank you. Thank you for your hard work. It was a bit cold. CELEB FIVE'S WAITING ROOM Only a few days remain. What? Until what? Until what? Are you serious? - Eun-i. - The Netflix show. I thought you were talking about Young-mi's ovulation. I thought you were talking about your life. I thought you only had a few days left to live. People don't give a notice before passing. People pass away suddenly. That's black comedy. Fortunately, I'm still healthy. You are healthy. Eun-i, your hair turned gray from worrying. - Seriously. - Your back is more hunched. Only a few days remain. Can you sleep at night? - We planned thoroughly. - We squeezed out all of our ideas. - What are you talking about? - Don't you agree? The more we brainstorm, the funnier our jokes will be. - Right. - Let's brainstorm some more. For goodness' sake. Not even the CEO of Netflix would be this fussy. How do you read this? I see. Didn't you learn English? I thought it was "Whatmeal." How will you make a Netflix show? DON'T YOU WANT INTERNATIONAL FAME? I have a friend who is bad at English. - Who? - Gang-bok. Who is Gang-bok? He is a fellow comedian. - On SBS… - I remember. - He uses the Gyeongsang dialect. - He was in a comedy skit. - Pickled Radish Academy. - Yes. Yes. Gang-bok is quite manly. - Really? - Yes. He always says, "Just you watch." - What? - "Just you watch." What? - Is that Chinese? - Is that Chinese? I didn't say, "Dui buqi." "Just you watch. I will find success in the end." What? Many comedians are like that. Gang-bok's pronunciation is terrible. - He doesn't do it to be funny. - When he sees Nature Republic, he goes, "It's an ice cream store. Natuur." NATUUR "Natuur." - That's funny. - What a unique man. I have another story about Gang-bok. One time, we went to a buffet. It was everyone's first time going to a buffet. All of us were like, "Gosh, this is incredible." We were in awe. Gang-bok went, "Hey, we're celebrities." "Don't be like that." "You embarrass me." "This is rice cake." "Just eat it. Why are you taking photos?" "Gosh, I need bread." - Why? - It was butter. IT WAS BUTTER, NOT A RICE CAKE He ate a big piece of butter thinking it was a rice cake. "Hey, this is rice cake." "Why are you impressed?" One time, Gang-bok and I appeared in a period movie. Comedians appeared in movies back then. That's right. - He was Dracula. - I bet it was uncomfortable. The role involves fake teeth. He wore fake fangs. "Okay. Cue." "We can't…" "Given the situation…" "Cut. What are you saying?" "Hey, what are you saying?" - "Hey." - That's so scary. "Practice! Didn't you memorize the lines?" "I memorized the lines. I'm sorry." "Cue!" "Get rid of them!" "The situation is…" "I advise against…" For goodness' sake. - That's insane. - "Hey. Cut." "Let's just move on," the director said. I see. We watched the movie at a movie theater. It was released in theaters? - Yes, and the scene was in the movie. - Okay. The scene we saw at the movie theater went like this. "Get rid of them!" "We can't do that." "Given the situation, we should never do that." - What? - They had added a voice-over since his pronunciation was so bad. - A voice-over. - Seriously. They had a Korean guy dub his lines. It was a voice actor. Suddenly… "We can't do that. Given the situation, we should never do that." How did it sound in real life? "We can't… Such an action…" I burst out laughing. - True story. - That's insane. You should look up the movie. You would have to know Gang-bok to find the joke funny. You laughed hard. - Seriously. - Don't worry. I don't want to turn this into Lee Gang-bok Show. Eun-i, you upset me. - You upset me. - You upset me. You are too much. I have a suggestion. I watch a lot of Netflix shows. The top shows are about dating. - It's like that with Korean shows too. - Yes. Regardless of the genre, elements of love… - They captivate the audience. - That's right. We should also talk about our relationships. - Yes. - Good idea. MEETING MINUTES 1. GANG-BOK'S STORIES: MANLY MAN'S ENGLISH, MOVIE APPEARANCE 2. WE MUST INCLUDE STORIES ABOUT OUR RELATIONSHIPS! Let's do some other thing. Didn't you hear laughter? No way. You're hearing things. - It's a sense of inferiority. - Seriously. I will talk. You're the only one who has such stories. - Since I haven't talked about it, - Go ahead. - My dating life is veiled in mystery. - Yes. - Yes. - My last relationship was… I think it was during the 2002 World Cup. Ahn Jung-hwan's ring ceremony. He told me that I looked so good in red. BONG-SEON'S DATING LIFE? - The Red Devils. - It was 2002. - The World Cup relationship. - It ended then. At least it was in the 21st century. EUN-I'S LAST RELATIONSHIP WAS IN THE 20TH CENTURY Eun-i, you haven't dated at all after it hit 2000? You haven't? What? - Let's talk about something else. - Seriously. I can't listen to the music from my last boyfriend because it's in a floppy disk. The memory got frozen due to advancements in technology. Relationships are a great topic in comedy. - What a shame. - We can't adjust to modern society. The hustle and bustle of modern society. Or we can make something like Three Hot to Handle. - What's that? - We can do that. - What's that? - You know Too Hot to Handle. No. We should put eight single men and eight single women on an island. The winner gets a billion won. But with any physical intimacy, the prize money gets deducted. NO PHYSICAL INTIMACY How much money gets deducted for one night? FOR ONE NIGHT? Why do you ask? You might as well go all out. - Go all out. - That's how everyone thinks. - Then no one's won the prize? - No. - Really? - Why not? Everyone thinks that at first. "You just need to stay celibate." Seriously. Why can't they do it? Why can't they win a billion won? For a billion won, I could go a year without sex. Hey, Eun-i would have won ten billion won. She would have 100 billion won. - I would be filthy rich. - Seriously. She'd be as rich as Mark Zuckerberg. Foreign shows can be racy, but not Korean shows. The moment the contestants' eyes meet, a Korean show would show the sky. - Seriously. - It would be like this. CAMERAWORK FOR CENSORSHIP - It's very sudden. - Afterward, - they get married. - Yes. But Netflix shows are different. They start from the door. - Come here. - The door? - Young-mi and I will show you. - We should know such things. It's different from the start. Netflix shows are different. - Here I go. - Okay. THEY ARE BUSY FROM THE START STRUGGLING - Stop fighting. - Stop fighting. STRUGGLING HOLLYWOOD Are you insane? Are you insane? You're insane! - You're insane! - You're insane! It won't be allowed, okay? It will get edited out. Sit down. Attention. Sit down. It won't be allowed. - It's true. - 365 Days is like that. - Seriously. - What's 365 Days? - In 365 Days, - Here. - It happens all the time. - Come here. - Bong-seon, open the curtain. - Okay. Draw the curtain. - Do you want us to open it? - Yes. GIGGLING They're being weird. So this is how racy Netflix shows are. - Yes. - This is how racy they are. What are you doing? Hey. Stay in there. - You're insane. - Stay in there. - Stay in there. - It's true. Eun-i, scold them. - Grab my hair. - Do you want to do that on our show? It'll be a disaster. Come on out. We need to brainstorm. HOLLYWOOD - This is insane. - You're insane! - Come on out. - Hey! - Come on out. - This is what Netflix shows are like. - What? - It's what Netflix shows are like. For goodness' sake. - Why did you bring a rod? - You're so conservative. - You're so conservative. - Are you out of your mind? Such things are allowed in Netflix shows. I can't look in that direction anymore. - Why? - Why? - The image is burned into my retinas. - What? - Are people going at it? - Yes. Seriously, we only have a few days. - Earlier... - Didn't we talk about black comedy? There haven't been many funeral jokes. - Not many. - Real funeral jokes. People do it, - but they're cautious about it. - Yes. When my dad passed away, Sung-kwang came to the funeral. He lit up an incense stick and carefully placed it in the sand. But he burned himself. - That was detailed. - After a beat… I burst out laughing. - I am Sung-kwang. - I bet he was serious. I bet he was serious. When Mi-ryeo's dad passed away, I went to Gwangju. Mi-ryeo thanked me for coming. Mi-ryeo's mom also went, "Shin-young, thank you." "Sure, ma'am." - I couldn't tell them to hang in there. - Right. You were careful. - You knew words wouldn't comfort them. - I sat quietly. Let's say you're me. Mi-ryeo's uncle came. MI-RYEO'S UNCLE APPEARED "Are you a comedian?" "Yes, I'm Kim Shin-young." "I'm Gwangju's comedian." "Can you beat me?" "I'm Gwangju's comedian." - He said that. - For goodness' sake! - Shin-young! - Stop making things up! - Stop it! - I didn't make it up. I swear. - This is why - Unbelievable. - People think comedians exaggerate. - I swear it actually happened. - Did it actually happen? - It did. I just said, "I can't beat you." - "I can't beat you." - "I can't beat you." - "You can't?" - "No." "Hey, I beat Kim Shin-young." "I beat her." I didn't say anything to that. "I bet you can't do this." "I'm Gwangju's comedian." You're lying. I'm not joking. Everyone burst out laughing. Mi-ryeo's mom was in mourning clothes. "Shin-young, I'm sorry. I think his brother's death broke him." "I'm sorry. He must have gone crazy." "His brother's death must've broken him." "I'm sorry. This is upsetting." - "It's okay." - "I'm sorry." - This is a true story. - That's so funny. - I would have laughed too. - Even at a funeral home, people recognize you and ask you for an autograph. That's the most embarrassing. Let's say we need to go to Room Six. People who were sitting quietly in Room Four… I'll pass by. I'm a celebrity. THE GAZE OF SOMEONE WHO RECOGNIZED A CELEBRITY - I know that gaze. - Seriously. - That happens. - I know. When mourners ask for an autograph, I don't know what to do. They bring the guest book. - The guest book. - That's right. They bring the guest book and ask, "Can I get your autograph?" - In mourning clothes. - It's very awkward. You can't say no. I usually give autographs cheerfully. - But I can't be cheerful then. - It's awkward. Let's say you are in Busan, Gyeongsang Province. - Middle-aged women do this - My hometown. When they recognize you. They just do this. "Hey!" SHOOTING A LOOK "You're Shin Bong-seon, right?" I've met this woman before. "Shin Bong-seon!" "Why didn't you call me when you came to Busan?" "I don't have your number." "I can fix that. Give me your phone." "I can't do that." - "You're so pretty!" - "Thank you." - "I like you so much." - "Thank you." - "Seriously." - They are full of love. - "Take a photo with me." - "Okay." - This is creepy. - "I'll take the photo." - "One, two, three. Click." - "Shin Bong-seon." They keep shaking your belly. They take photos like this. "Shin Bong-seon." - I've met her before. - They exist. They are full of love and affection. - It's like this in Jeolla Province. - Jeolla. - Sit still. - Okay. You are at a venue when a middle-aged woman walks over. WHEN A CELEBRITY MEETS A MIDDLE-AGED WOMEN IN JEOLLA PROVINCE "Hello." - "Hello." - "It's you, right?" - "Yes." - "Shin Bong-seon." - "Yes." - "I saw a lot of your works." - "I see." - "I'm a big fan." - "Sit down." - "Should I sit down?" "Gosh, your face is tiny." "No. You're too kind. Thank you." - "You're so pretty." - "Thank you." "I can't believe it." - "Hey." - "Hey." - "Shin Bong-seon is here." - "Can't you see I'm busy?" "A celebrity came to our neighborhood." - "Hello." - "I can't believe it." WHISPERING - "Her face is tiny." - "Seriously." "She is a celebrity." - "I need to change." - "Do you need to change?" "Go right ahead." SHE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO PLEASE LET ME GO NOW "I need to change." Some middle-aged women are really like them. - The conversation doesn't end. - They keep talking. I am thankful. It's nice because they're like my mom, but… But they don't leave. They keep staring. It's like they're watching TV. - I guess they find us approachable. - Yes. Not many people touch me right away. Let's say you're me. - Eun-i. - A passer-by notices me. Give me your glasses so that I can play you. - Do you have to take things that far? - Let's make it funny. - Make it funny. - I am Eun-i. - Hold on. Hey. - What? You made fun of Eun-i. I was just doing Eun-i. Eun-i is angry. - Let's make it funny. - That's right. Do I do that? I don't have rhinitis anymore. Do you have to take things that far? Would Netflix know that I am Eun-i? - Would people know? - A worrywart. I am so offended. - Come on. - Eun-i. Come on. You've been waiting for this. There are many senior comedians who are really funny. One senior comedian often played a tavern lady. I know who she is. Yes. - "Teacher." - All right. "Yes?" "Here is what I think about graduation." "In order to graduate, - "we put in a lot of effort." - She kept clapping. Why did she do that? - "Now, - It was from playing a tavern lady. I was there." "Things were quite difficult." "I saw it with my own eyes." She delivered her lines like that. That's so good. Tavern ladies were played like that back in the day. - That's right. - I found it so funny, but other comedians talked to her. "Can't you deliver lines without clapping?" "You should stop clapping." - It was excessive. - Since she clapped so much, - it broke people's concentration. - That's right. - It drowns out other sounds. - She couldn't clap anymore. - "Teacher." - Without clapping? - All right. - "Yes?" "The theme of the day is an entrance ceremony." - She couldn't clap anymore. - "Here is what I think." - Oh, no. - "Here is what I think - Her hands are moving aimlessly. - "About an entrance ceremony." "Well…" - Oh, no. - "Let me start over." - Oh, no. - That's so scary. She messed up 20 times. Oh, no. - I know what it's like. - After that, other comedians went, "Just clap." "Teacher, here is what I think about an entrance ceremony." "When March comes, we enter school," trees begin to sprout, "and grass grows from the ground." "So it's the month of growth." - She did so well. - She had to clap. She had to clap. It's like that. She depended on clapping. - Yes. - She had to clap. - Yes. - She had to do it. - That was funny. - We're set. - Eun-i, we're set. - We're set. - Let's clap. - We're ready. Clapping is universal. - Let's go into the closet. - Let's go. - Goodness. - We're set. Young-mi, come on in. LET'S GO TO HOLLYWOOD We're set. We're set. Let's wrap it up for today. "For today"? - Thank you for your hard work. - Okay. Don't read her messages. WE CAN DO IT! CELEB FIVE'S WAITING ROOM Please stand by. - Okay. - Let's go. This is nerve-racking. We are finally doing this. Eun-i, don't be nervous. Eun-i, relax. Eun-i, please relax your shoulders. TIME LEFT UNTIL THE SHOW - Please come this way. - Okay. Thank you. There must be a lot of people. There must be a lot of people. I heard so. I can hear them. - It's been years. - I know. Take a peek. - There are a lot of people. - Really? - Are the seats full? - Yes. I'm so nervous right now. It's been years. It's okay. We prepared it well. It will be fun. Right? You seem to be the most nervous. Why are you so nervous? - Things didn't go according to my plan. - Nonsense. We haven't even begun. - If you need to pee… - No. - Please take the stage now. - Okay. Let's go. - Celeb Five! - Celeb Five! - Okay. Let's go. - Let's do this. TIME LEFT UNTIL THE SHOW - Good luck. - Good luck. Please welcome them. Are you ready to enjoy the show? - Let's do this. - Guys. Are you ready? We aren't here to beat Squid Game. - So don't feel pressured, and relax. - I give you… Let's do this.
