Produced at Gorky Film Studio in 1955 Lyana - Not in a hurry? - Nah, they'll pick me up. - We'll go together. - Well, don't be late. It will be alright. - Lyana, what happened? - Nothing serious! - Does it hurt? - It'll be okay by the wedding-day! - No, it won't. - Why do you say that? - Lyana, I'm thinking about sending matchmakers to you. What? Andrey... What... How? Should I do that, Lyana? Well, I don't know, Andrey... Maybe you should. - Good afternoon, girls! - Hello! Twenty-seven, twenty-eight... Everyone. Okay, let's go. Hello, girls. Hurry up! Do you realize what're you doing to us? Stepan Vasilyevich, it's not my fault, I'm telling you! I was washing a car, I got sweaty, I drank some water... What could I do? - You drank, and you could do nothing? - It was water! Just look at that, the best voice in our kolkhoz! - No, seriously, where's my fault? - I see nothing funny! We're passing a review in Kishinev soon! So I'm warning all of you... you know what I'm talking about! - Sure, sure! Okay. I hope so. - Start the car. - To the cars! National Theatre of Moldavia Moldavian folk song "A boy from neighbour village" Performed by Ilyana Stacnhu, junior foreman assistant from Vinorgadov's brigade at the kolkhoz "New Life"! Violin by Andrey Nistrianu! Whatever road I walk, whatever path I take, I always meet that boy, the boy from a neighbour village. I've known him for a long time, but I just can't understand, what is so attractive about this street, so far from his home? Every time he seems to be on business, but not in a hurry to get it done. He talks little, he talks timidly, and to me, he doesn't talk at all. But when he plays violin, forgetting about his important business, my heart finally understands the boy from the neighbour village. And now - Tat folk dance! - Ready? - Yes! You're next! Wait a second, we have one more performance! The committee has shortened it. - But it says here... - It has been pulled off. - What?! - Your performance, pulled off. - Nonsense. Let's go! - What are you doing? - It's only three minutes. - Impossible! - Lift the curtains! - What?! What are you doing? What are you doing? Wha... Come on, everyone, hurry up. I'm going to make a complaint! Yeah, you do that. Attention! Ready? Three... Four... - Find out what's going on. - Okay. Tell them to cut off that improvising. Just three minutes! They've been rehearsing it the whole summer! - Could you sit down, please? - Just listen to them! Attaboy! Attaboy! That's the way to play it, kid! That's how you should learn to play! Don't tell anyone, Sasha. We're going to buy them, hide them and present them in a proper circumstances. - It's a surprise! - I got it, Stepan Vasilyevich. Fellows! Fellows, come here! Stepan Vasilyevich has got a surprise for you. - What is it? - Not a word about this! He told me not to say anything. To you - a trumpet! A violin! An accordion! With a white case! That's nice! - They're looking for you! - Wait, we're being filmed. - The committee is calling for you. - What for? I don't know. Let's go. We want to present these diplomas not only to the best, but to those... - who deserve praise as well. - That's right. "Best in singing, best in work, Ilyana Stacnhu". - Is this okay? - What do you mean? - Best in singing and in working. - Oh, yes, sure! - Paraschiva Noor. - Yes. Andrei Nistrianu, Alexey Mamulat, Grigoriy Kympyanu... - What an excellent trio! - Yes, they are... May I keep these three diplomas for the time being? Which diplomas? What for? - The expression doesn't quite fit. - Which expression? "Best in work". Stepan Vasilyevich... Maybe it's not so bad? They were really good! If you permit, I'd rather present them when it's proper! Fellas! What a talent! Glad to make an acquaintance! I'd like to propose a toast, follow me! Sorry, we can't. - My name's Georgiy Ivanovich! - Excuse us, but we can't. The beer's on me! - No, really, we're going to the hall. - To get our diplomas! Ah, I see! Well, I'll be waiting in the buffet! The kolkhoz "New Life" is awarded with an opportunity to participate in the All-Union review in Moscow! Ilyana Stanchu! Best in singing, best in work! Paraschiva Noor! Olga Ungulyau! Alexander Ilyau! Andrey... Iryin! Ekaterina Kotyca! Michail Marek! Nikolay Piyeria! Mariya Ruthu! May I disturb for a second? Take that and bring here two bottles of beer. Okay. Fellas! Here! - No, thanks. - Wha... How... Comrade, have you seen three men from our collective? - I have. - Where are they? - They left. - What? - What happened? - Have you heard them play? I did! Great talents! And yet they gave them nothing. We all got our diplomas - look - and they didn't. I see. Fellas! Fellas! Hiya! Hi. Pour us some of that. Here... and here... Tastes great. - Now don't get upset, fellas. - It's an insult, Georgiy Ivanovich. - Call me Gitya. - It's an insult, Git. I see, fellas. Forget about these backstage intrigues! Look at me! I'm fine without any diplomas! I used to be in a kolkhoz too. An accountant. I took part in those amateur events, they didn't like me as well. - So what? I'm still here! - So what do you do? I play on weddings. A wedding in Truslena - 500, in Suslena - 300, in Kiperchena - 100 each, and everything's hunky-dory. And with your talents... it's gonna be a piece of cake. - Three excellent weddings. - Don't, guys. Sorry, Georgiy Ivanovich, but we can't. Why not? It's not far, you'll be done in a jiffy. - Don't! - No, thanks, Georgiy Ivanovich. We gotta go home. Too bad, so much money going to waste. Well, cheers. Cheers. - Now don't get upset, fellas. - It's an insult, Georgiy Ivanovich. An insult, duh. One... two... three... look at me... Comrades, are you from 23? - We are. - Come here. Where were you? They'd been looking all over for you. Then they paid and left. - Left? When? - Yesterday. Here's the receipt for the luggage-room. - Can we stay for the night? - All rooms are occupied. What shall we do? The first class is vacant. - How much is it? - Sixty rubles. - Shall I write a receipt? - Go ahead. No, wait a minute. Fellas! Hey, fellas! Stop! Stop here! Hello, guys! Hello, Grisha! Such a hot day, and you're travelling on a cart! - Hop into the car! - We have no money. - What do you mean, "no money"? - We had to pay for the hotel. Nonsense! Hop in, it's on me! On a cart, it would take you a week to come home! And then there's a wedding in Truslena - 500, a wedding in Suslena - 300, in Kiperchena - 100 each! Come on, guys, it's along the way! We'll get it done in no time! Come on! - Well, Grisha? - It's along the way, so why not. To the left! I told you, fellas - don't get upset! Can you play a march? Important guests have arrived. Fellas! A march! Three... Four... It's Stepan Vasilyevich! It's Stepan Vasilyevich! Greetings, comrades! My congratulations to the newly-weds! Stepan Vasilyevich, we have reserved a seat for you. Thank you so much, but I don't have time! Excuse me! Comrades Nystrianu, Mamulat, Kympyanu! You must report to the administration by 8 o'clock. Lyana. Grigoriy, wake up! Alexei! Read it. Due to their misbehaviour, truancy and drinking, Komsomol is asking the administration of kolkhoz to take off all the diplomas of comrades Nystrianu, Mamulat and Kympyanu, that they have received last year. I agree. Go on, take them home. We didn't hang them. So we're not the ones to take them off. That's right. You didn't hang them. It was me, an old fool! I shut my eyes on a lot of things, nursed you, all because of that damn fife! There won't be much left on the wall, Stepan Vasilyevich! Don't you worry about that! Our pride is our labour! Count it. - Well, let's go to the rehearsal. - I'm not going. Twenty-five... Me too, they'll do without us. Maybe you're right. Stepan Vasilyevich is coming... here. Come in. Hello. They're here, Ivan Vasilyevich! - Hello. - Hello, Ivan Vasilyevich. - Why aren't you rehearsing? - We're busy studying. Studying what? Agrotechnics. You told us... Great timing! Just when we need to rehearse most! We're playing in Moscow in two weeks! - May I sit? - Please. Are you going to watch, Ivan Vasilyevich? If you permit, yes. - Let's continue then. - Go on, Grisha. - As soon as the snow melted... - You should study that in winter. We don't care, we're gonna study the full cycle. Go on, Grisha. As soon as the snow melted... a selective harrowing was carried out. The ploughing of the vineyard... I see. A good way to start studying, my friends. But bear in mind, that cheating won't work. I will personally conduct your exam. Got that? - Yes, Stepan Vasilyevich. - That's right. Let's go, girls. - Shall we read the preface? - Of course not. An introduction. The following book is based on the results of the work of the State Research Institute. - Maybe we can skip the introduction? - Yeah. Let's start with the first chapter. Chapter one. Comrade Mamulat! (Comrade Mamulat!) ...Its application and development turned out to be beyond the powers of tsarist government... What's there? Tell your students that we can easily do without them. Whatever did they mean by that? - Hiya! - Hello, girls! The differentiation of meristematic cells in a growing tip... begins with the appearance of three layers of elongated cells... Picture number twenty-nine. There it is. Interesting... to be exact - inner layers of cells in the central cylinder. A leaf without a pattern; What happened, Mariora? It hurts to hear, Mariora, That your darling is getting married, Mariora. Let them be; I wish him happiness. But I can't say I won't hold the grudge; Because I'm going to marry too! But I can't say I won't hold the grudge; Because I'm going to marry too. And then I'll be happy looking at him biting his nails. So what, if I'm not rich? It was her work all this time. With the diplomas, and with those musicians. Weren't going to propose to her? No, she'll have to wait now. And that's why I'm hurt. Paraschiva! - What? - Come here. These guys are good, but I'm still against it. What a shame! Borrowing talents from neighbours, as if we don't have any of our own! - I'd rather send noone to Moscow! - What shall we do then? We gotta influence them somehow. Tell you what, we should marry them. - Who? - Lyana and Andrey. - Nah, won't work. - Don't you worry about that. This will be my job. First thing, we gotta separate them. - Who? - Andrey, Grisha and Alesha. We'll deal with them one at a time. Okay then. Go ahead. - Who's there? - It's me! - "Me" who? - Just me! - May I come in? - Yes. - Are you home? - Yes. - And nobody else? - No. - Paras... - Yes? - May I? - You may. - Are you on business or just visiting? - Just visiting. - Paras... - Mm? - Why are you talking to me like that? - Why, I'm talking to you as usual. - Are you in a hurry? - Yes, I'm in a great hurry. Where to? Where to? Rehearsing again, am I right?! It's none of your business, you chump! A chump? Okay then... I'm gonna find your trumpeters and break their legs! Hey! Alesha! Alesha! I'm gonna show them what comrade Mamulat is! Alesha! Will you stop already? I'm listening. What is the matter? - Alesha! - Paraschiva! Now you'll go to rehearsals, and I'll help you study. I have all the lectures in my copy-book. - I won't, Paras. - No, you will. - I won't, Paras. - No, you will. - I won't. - You will. I can't do that without Andrey and Grisha. They'll go too and everything will be fine. Paras... Andrey won't go because of Lyana. - Yes, he will. - No, he won't. - I say he will. - I say he won't. - He will. - Paras... he won't. Then we must make them get together again. I'll talk to Lyana and you - to Andrey. Well, she can't be the first one to talk, can she? No, that won't work. Let's do this instead: I'll talk to Lyana and you - to Andrey. Nope, that won't work either. - Yes, it will. - No, it won't. - Yes, it will. - No, it won't. He's a good boy. Well... - Do your matchmaking then. - We will. They'll be grateful the rest of their lives. Go ahead then! I'll go put on something more decent. - Child! - Yes, Grandfather? Come out, you have guests! Well-well, are these the guests? What, do you want to rehearse? No. - What for, then? - We're delegates from Andrey. Delegates? Lyana, marry him. You chumps... That's no way to do this! - How then? - "How"! Did you really think a girl would say, just like that, whether she wants to get married? You should invite her to the table. Make an irrelevant conversation about something. I would've put a bottle of wine... And you should've dressed better than this for such occasion! And you're doing this like you're in a store! "You got any nails? No? Well, okay then, we'll be going." - What should we do, Grandpa? - "What should we do"... Gimme that dish. And you - that headscarf. Let's go, child. What should I do? If you accept our proposition, give us this headscarf. Great! Newsreels. 8 o'clock A republican review of local talents has taken place in Kishinev lately with a great success. Best groups of the republique performed on the stage of the National Theatre of Moldavia. Junior foreman assistant from the kolkhoz "New Life" Ilyana Stanchu and Andrey Nistrianu, a worker. Spectators showed keen interest in the results of the competition. During breaks people shared their impressions in the lobby. Sasha...

In the next few days the company will travel to Moscow To participate in the All-Union review. The winners of that review will be awarded with an honour to represent the Soviet youth at the international festival. End of the issue. Andrey! I'm very happy, Andrey. I am very happy too. What's taking them so long? It's not long at all. Such things require time. You're strange. - I don't understand. - And I do understand very well. Why did you send your girlfriends to me - - this I don't understand. - What girlfriends? It was you who sent your friends. Sent who? Alesha... Grisha... - Your matchmakers! - What matchmakers? I didn't send anyone, Lyana. Forgive us, Andrey. We went on our own. - Why did you... - Lyana agreed, and her grandpa too! I'm not talking about that! Thank you guys! Thank you very much! Lyana! Lyana... Three... four... Uh-oh. Just look at what's going on. Whose section is it? I said, whose section is it? Alesha, Grisha and Andrey. Let's go. Don't stand there, come on. Andrey! Alesha! Grisha! - Stepan Vasilyevich wants to see you! - What? Stepan Vasilyevich wants to see you, right now! - What does he want? - I don't know, something about exams. Come on! - Ready? - Ready. I see you've brought your notations. - Looks like you're prepared. - We studied hard. I got only one question for the three of you. How does one tie up the vines? - Are you kidding, Stepan Vasilyevich? - No, I'm serious. - Do you know that? - Of course we do. Well... if you know that, then let's continue with the exam. Let's go! Let's go, comrades! There! Take a good look. Shame on you, Andrey! - Stepan Vasilyevich, let them come! - Please! No, I won't. What shall we do without them in Moscow? We'll help them, Stepan Vasilyevich, honest! Sasha. Bring it. Stepan Vasilyevich, we're asking you, please! Enough! Too much fuss over them! You said yourself it's a shame to go to Moscow with someone else! And I was right! Vasya! Come here. Come here! Here. Play my favourite. - I won't, Stepan Vasilyevich. - Play it, I'm asking you. You're going to play it in Moscow. Take it! I decided! You're not going anywhere! - What do you mean? - I won't let you! - I will go, Andrey. - No, you won't. - I will! - You won't, Lyana! - I will! - I won't let you go and that's it! Grandpa! Grandpa! Am I a bridegroom or what? Can I hold her here or not? In old times, you could even slay her. - But I'm a bridegroom. - Yes, for now. What does it mean, "for now"? If she leaves, I don't need her! Get that? Well, we don't really need guys like you either. Then it's settled! No, it's not settled. She will leave. Bye, Grandpa! - Heard everything? - Yes. Lyana, can you do it my way? I can't. - You can do it my way, though! - No! - I can't either, then! - Well, then... What? Speak! Call it different personalities! Different personalities, then. Tell you what, guys. I'm leaving after the harvest. It's decided. I won't be able to stay like that, meeting her at every corner. Comrades! May I borrow some grapes from you? I'll pay you! Gitsa! Georgiy Ivanovich! Fellas! Hello, fellas! - Hello, Alexei. - Hello. Andrei! - How's it going, fellas? - Not bad, and you? I'm fine, fine. - Hello, Georgiy Ivanovich. - Hi, Grisha! Thank you! Where's your violin, Georgiy Ivanovich? What good is it now? Every kolkhoz has their own musicians. They're playing for free now. Sit down, Gitsa. eat. Fellas, is there any work for me around here, by any chance? Eat, Gitsa, eat. We'll talk later. The International Festival of Youth is now open! Hear the report from the Festival! Too bad Alesha isn't here. - You're lucky. - Why is that? Because you'll be together when you come back. And us, we have different personalities. Today - twenty tons. Tomorrow we'll finish with the grapes. Best of luck. - How is it? - Done with the last. - How much? - Two hundred eighteen. Good job. - Everything's first class! - Again, good job! Stepan Vasilyevich, you're like a father to me. I need to talk to you. What's wrong, Andrey? - Do you know about me and Lyana? - I know. - She broke up with you. - I broke up with her. - Liar. It was her. - Stepan Vasilyevich! Okay, okay, so it was you. And? And now I... It's hard. She's near me when I work. - I meet her at the streets! - I see, Andrey. I see. Some character she's got. - It's hard. - I can't! Yeah, yeah... You need to do something decisive about this. - Once and... - So I did. - That's right! - Here! That's right! Make a decision! What's this? Permission to transfer to the neighbour kolkhoz. - What for? - That's the... decision. Are you insane? - You said it yourself. - What did I say? What did I say? Look at him... Take it away! Take it away! I'm talking to you like to my father and you... Just let me go! - I've had enough! - Enough of whom? - Enough of her! - Of her?! She's gold! It's still a question, who's putting up with who! I don't need her anyway! Gold! You don't need her? If you don't care about the people who... With whom... If you're fed up with your own kolkhoz - go! I'll raise this question at the meeting! No, wait. Here, take it. I wanted to present this on a proper occasion. Take it. Pack your things. - May I come in? - Lyana? Come in. It's alright! We'll manage! He'll regret it! We won't cry about it! What's wrong, Lyana? What's wrong? Stepan Vasilyevich, you're like a father to me. I need to talk to you. - Here. - What is it? It is hard... side by side with him in one kolkhoz. Are you insane?! - Do you know about me and Andrey? - I know. He... No, you... You both did... I know! You don't love him, that's what I'll tell you! No. I love him. But still I don't want us to be together. Heard the news? Lyana is leaving our kolkhoz. - Duh. There's worse. - What? Andrey is leaving kolkhoz. - No way! - Just like that. - My, my, what a pity. - Yeah. - My, my, what a pity. - What? Lyana! Lyana, dear! Good news! They kicked out Andrey! Serves him right! - Kicked out? - Or he left by himself, who cares? Let's go take your application back! Come on! Lazy cows! Andrey! Andrey! - Let's go take your application back! - What happened? Lyana is leaving kolkhoz. Go to Stepan Vasilyevich and take it back. Stepan Vasilyevich, here's what I think. If Lyana leaves, Andrey can stay. What? I'm saying, if Lyana leaves, Andrey can stay. Wait... Lyana leaves, Andrey stays. Andrey leaves... Stepan Vasilyevich! May I have it back please? I'm staying. Good! Take it! Now that's right. Lyana leaves, the fella stays. - May I, Stepan Vasilyevich? - Come in, come in. Stepan Vasilyevich, may I take it back please? Thank you, Stepan Vasilyevich! - Bye! - Goodbye! Lyana! Lyana! Andrey! Andrey! What did you want, Andrey? I wanted to say goodbye, Lyana. - Goodbye, Andrey. - Goodbye. Goodbye forever, Lyana. Forever. Goodbye. That's it! What? You're not going anywhere. And I'm not.
