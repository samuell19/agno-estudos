I bow to him, the son of sage Kashyap, whose colours are like Hibiscus flower, who destroys darkness, all sins and ignorance and provides life and daylight. Just as the sun’s rays in the sky are extended to the mundane vision, the wise and learned devotees see the supreme abode of Lord Vishnu in the same way. Let me see, dear... What have you worn here, my dear? Sacred thread! Sacred thread? Like me? Yes! But why? Because I want to be a priest. Is it? The sacred thread makes you a priest like me? Doesn’t it? My big secret... The priest is yet to arrive… when will the puja start? Bulbuli! Can any of you perform the puja? The priest is nowhere to be seen! What do you mean? The auspicious time is about to be over! You girls took the responsibility! If you could do a single task properly! Without a priest how can you continue? Did you get didi on the phone? What happened? Did you find anyone? There… Shabaridi has come! Trying to find the priest… arrives the beauty… What to choose between your beauty and quality! Shut up! Like to be framed for that? Didi… the priest hasn’t come as yet… the auspicious time will be over in a while! You look so nervous! Auspicious moments and stars hardly matter! Your arrangements are done? Yes! Everything is complete except the 'madhuparko'… There is still time for the play… Come! Let’s go! How beautiful you look! Didi… what is 'madhuparko'? 'Madhuparko'... As part of regular worship, you can offer God whatever you want… but on a special day… like say, your birthday… you’ve certain special wishes… Likewise, in regular worship, we give fruits and other offerings… but on special days, we offer 'madhuparko'… You mean Saraswati Puja is celebrating the goddess' birthday? Yes...! It does mean goddess Saraswati’s birthday… So, will you all offer anjali? Yes! Distribute the flowers! O Devi Saraswati, the most auspicious goddess of knowledge with Lotus-like eyes, An embodiment of knowledge with big eyes, Bless me with knowledge, I salute you! All of you pray with folded hands – Such that knowledge never leaves you… Take a vow that you’ll never let go of the hand of knowledge… We’ll never let go… In this one act drama competition, our next offering is a drama by Sabda Brahma drama group – ‘Today’s Mahabharat’. Presented by the respected lecturer of Bangamata College Smt. Shabari Gangopadhyay. She teaches Sanskrit, right? Yes. In a single piece of cloth, I declare that I’m in menses. In spite of pulling at her saree for hundred years, you cannot strip her. Draupadi is that bold woman... whose valour never ends. Passage of hundreds of years is of little significance. We hail that woman whose valour has transcended time. What is this? What are they showing? I don't know! Stop this drama! This is against our culture! Get lost. It is becoming impossible to sit in front of TV… now even in schools and colleges… Do you call her a lecturer? Fie! 03 00 I quite like it. 10... You liked it... eh? Winner. This is Mahabharat's Draupadi! Stop… stop… Park the car a little ahead… Can anyone be so glum after such a performance? You? My name is Bikram… Bikramaditya Chakraborty… I was a judge in your drama competition… So sorry… actually… you saw the audience reaction! I didn't notice you… My bus has arrived… Thank you… bye… The chance is gone… Did you say anything? This is my bus too… come… Get up! Sister! Is she related to you? No... Will you please sit here? I’m holding your seat… Please… she will sit here… Sorry! Do you think all unknown men are Duhshashon? Yes? Do you consider all strangers to be Duhshashon? It’s not the question of man or woman, I don’t want to suddenly accept strangers to be familiar… Am I disturbing you? No! Were all the dialogues written by you? Then Draupadi is your favourite character? From childhood, I didn’t like Ramayana much… Had a lot of reservations about Sita… Though there are many differences between the Ramayanas by Valmiki and Tulsidas, but reading Mahabharat had always been a pleasure. Just think, you’ll not find a character so brave as Panchali… Exactly! And the way you’ve mingled women’s health awareness with the character of Draupadi is just inexplicable… Actually our drama group… The performance we just saw… The girls in our group… we try to raise awareness… making women aware of menstrual hygiene… giving information, making them understand… distributing sanitary napkins… Oh... Bringing bedroom and bathroom together! Now we can’t even board a bus! Right you are! That's why... at the bus stop I didn’t consider you to be Duhshashon! This is the reason why I lose my cool! In spite of all this, you’re continuing your work - that’s great… Proud of you! May I tell you the truth? Initially I had told you a lie… Actually I got into a scrape… I'm Bikramaditya Chakraborty… I live in Batasipur… My ma is the Panchayat Pradhan there… She couldn’t come… I’ve come as her proxy… Pardon me for this! Just a second... This is my card… Please tell me if you need me... I can be of help even without need! I can be of help even without need! Oh, nothing... Bye! Please stop the bus! Please inform me about your shows! Conspiracy! I’ll not tolerate this! Scheming against me! I’ll not tolerate! You’ll survive on me and then plot against me? Fie! Fie! That’s how I lost in one election! Feeding milk and banana to traitor Bibhishon! Instead of wearing these stone rings, it’s better to die by keeping stones on your chest! Why do you say that? You’re not that old! Shut up! ''You’re not that old!'' These stones are not working! Small things are becoming huge! What’s happened? Baba! I was playing marble with pishi-granny’s stones… They’re lost… Give me your mobile… I’ll play games… Wait... Take this and fly away! This phone is the root of all troubles! Is it a smart phone or unsmart phone? What’s happened? That happens regularly… The girls these days have become so unabashed… That day a girl in Kamala Cinema Hall… of the age of our Bakul if she had been alive now… started breastfeeding her child in front of everyone… Fie! Fie! How shameful! The society still exists! The guard was equally strict! He chucked her out of the hall! The girl started protesting! If you open your saree-blouse anywhere and everywhere, what’s the use of wearing these? Which film did you go to watch ma? Why should I watch a film? People from a news channel came, showed me the video and asked – I said, he has done it right... to have chucked her out of the hall! She should be kicked out of the society! Someone from the opposition conspired against me and gave it in the Facebook, which has become 'fever'… It’s not fever ma, say viral… viral! It’s the same – viral! Viral! Nowadays, it’s spreading fast! Sister-in-law! Mind you, I’ll realize that Rs 33,000 by every paisa! What are you reading? How to keep cool… Let me read… Suggesting stone rings! Affecting ignorance? Eh? Ma! Purchased stones worth Rs 17,500. All efforts to grab grandpa’s aunt’s husband’s land are getting futile! Oh ma! But why? I had a wish of owning a house! Son, you need to make a Tree Horoscope by Jacob Shastri! Then only will the reasons start pouring out like the branches of a tree! Then, I’ll give you a 8-rati chrysolite! Ma! Yes my dear! Maima! My goodness... Now you may leave… But my house? You’ll get it, but let me first keep my house secured! Gosh... Here you are! Take these! Your stone-studded rings! That Rs 33,000… I tell you I’ll realize every bit of it! Sister-in-law! Coming Tuesday… At 1.10 in the night… I’ll give you a 8-rati stone… Just see! In the coming election you’ll win by 10,000 votes! By 10,000 votes my dear sister-in-law! But it’s not possible without rigging! Here the total number of voters is only 8,000! Pishi, nimki? Such a big coverage of yesterday's incident? Such a trivial thing… Actually the sentiment of modern girls… Sentiment? Which sentiment? Undressing in public? My Bakul was never like this! I had personally selected her as the wife of my elder son! And Gurudasi? Did she see the horoscope of my younger son? My dear son! With time, you’ll fail to get quality girls for marriage. Beautiful, educated, devout follower of the scriptures, efficient in household chores… Please agree to marry! You want that? I want to show you a girl! How sweet! Wonderful! Are you listening? Yes? Come come! Met her at the competition yesterday… Very good looking... Is it all right? Superb! Listen! MP Birla Unique Cement 40 bags! Get it loaded in the vehicle! Quick! Sign the bills quickly! Don’t delay! And listen! Unique Cement must be loaded in the truck immediately! Don’t be late! Fast! What happened? Told you to sign the bills? Hey! Why haven’t you signed the bills? Which bill? Gave you the bills of Bharat Nirman for signing! In Mahabharat... where? Mahabharat! What has happened to you? I’m also trying to find that! So that’s final! You’ve already given the list… But I haven’t got your names as yet! Sona… Bulbuli… I’m Shabari! Mala. Mala… After we complete the script on marriage, is there anything else? There is one more – on 'griha pravesh'. Ok! Make the list of requisitions. Sorry! I returned so late from Tarapith last night that I got late today! Have you brought the prasad? If not, you’ll be penalized. I’m having periods! Will ma allow me to bring prasad? See... nothing can be changed just by distributing napkins… if we can’t change the minds of the people… In order to soak the set ideas embedded in their minds… so many superstitions, we’ll need many more napkins. Now make the list… What? Why are you looking at me? Durba grass… honey one bottle… kanthali banana 6 pieces… flower, bel leaves, batasa… Camphor? Noted… Nakuldana… No… bring them all on your way back… Make sure you don’t have any puja tomorrow… Try to keep yourself free… Why? A family will come to see you… At least meet them… What's wrong? Who will step in this hermitage tomorrow? Is it king Dushmanta? No… King Bikramaditya… I’m going… Ketu... Mercury… Rahu... O my my… good heavens… Sister-in-law! Yes? What a match! It’s a total match! It’s a grand match! 'Raj-jotak'! Wonderful! Then let’s complete the discussion. Ma, may I say something? Sure! As we discuss, let them talk! Ok ok! Carry on! You didn't reply to my last message. Can everything be shared on Facebook? No! Your terrace is so good! Did you fly kites? I had told you to call me for work… But you didn’t! So you yourself had to do the misdeed! No no! It’s not that! Whenever I see the Mahabharat on my bookshelf, it reminds me of you! Does your family know? What? Are you mad? Another Kurukshetra will happen… King Bikramaditya! Whose side are you on – the Pandavas or the Kauravas? None… I’m not in favour of sharing Panchali… What else do you do? I do pujas… What? Puja? Then you’ll love it in our house! We have pujas round the year… Ganesh, Akshay Tritiya, Jay Mangalbar, Mangal Chandi, Snan Jatra, Rath Jatra, Jhulan Jatra… then Manasha, Nabanna, Saraswati, Laxmi. Even Kartik? Kartik… No no… not Kartik… Why should there be Kartik? Golden bird, silver bird, honey inside the flower… In spite of my frantic calls, why don’t you answer my bride? Abeer has coloured her bashful eyes! The new bride, her new saree, smeared with new turmeric Adorned with new ornaments and capricious demands. The betel leaf bowl, the hair pin – where does it prick? Get up young lass – all is ready for your marriage! Oh dear teenage girl like Radha – betel leaf and nut Get up young lass – all is ready for your marriage! Benarasi saree woven with golden threads Light of the dark eyes lined with kajal As the night glides into the morning You’ll shift your abode to the groom’s Don’t shed tears my girl – you’re so good! Golden bird, silver bird, honey inside the flower… In spite of my frantic calls, why don’t you answer my bride? Abeer has coloured her bashful eyes! The brass anklets on those alta-laden feet are making noise The sound of sehnai is tugging at the heartstrings. The betel leaves have covered your eyes... The news has reached the native village. Get up young lass – all is ready for your marriage! What’s this? Everything is over? But Kanyadan? We don’t have the ritual of Kanyadan here… Mashima, has the bridegroom party completed dinner? Let's not get late... tomorrow we’ll have to come early. Leave it baba! Complete it. Everything is over! Wait! Heard there has been no Kanyadan in your case? Actually in our house, we… I’m least bothered about your house… rather since Kanyadan has not been done, I should not allow you to enter the house, because the marriage has not been completed… But I’ve a status in the society… so, I’m not creating a scene… Gurudasi... Yes, sister-in-law... Arrange for some corrective measure… Oh, yes! Coming Tuesday… One more thing! From today, the rules of this house are yours… Remember it! Come! Come this side! What a beautiful house! About 200 years old… yes! Come this side! That room with the red curtain… That is ma’s palmistry room... Oh, you don’t know? Ma is a palmist… Ma studies palms and horoscopes… And I’m her assistant… Then ma also prescribes remedial stones… Look at my stones… This is to enhance beauty… this makes you happy… this increases intelligence… this makes you gentle natured… Do you know what ma says? If I be a little quiet, I’ll have a great marriage! I’ll wear a red Benarasi saree! But I’m not quiet… Whatever… it has been only two months that ma has given it! I do not know if I’ve become quiet… have I? Better to have a daredevil sister-in-law than quiet! Isn’t it? Come this side… See! This is our kitchen… Look at these two gas stoves… Wait! Let me… let me explain… You see these two gas units… one here… and one there… This is for non-veg items... that is for veg items… ok? There are three cutters… That is for cutting vegetables… And there at the bottom… that is for cutting fruits, can you see that? And this one here… This is for cutting fish… ok? Meat is denied entry here… there is puja every day… 'Payesh' is made every morning… You’ll cook it before you go to college… Is that ok? She is Lakkhi… she will explain the rest of your duties… ok? And listen! No one in this house stays in bed after 6 in the morning… I enter the bathroom at 6.15… You’re the new bride… so you’ll take bath before that… Do not enter the kitchen with clothes worn overnight… If you do by mistake... then you’ll have to wash this entire kitchen… And the days you’re sick every month… Sick? My goodness! Don’t you know about the monthly sickness? Oh my dear boudi save me! Don’t you have that? What? I mean those few days of the month… It's known that entry in the prayer room is barred on those days… But here, you cannot enter the kitchen either… What do you mean? Save me boudi! Now what? You said this is the best match! That's what the horoscope indicated! Don’t you have a sense of holy and unholy? Everything will be spoiled... If you enter the kitchen. Lakkhi will deliver a calendar to your room… With red ink, you will encircle those days of the month… Understand? Lakkhi make her understand! Now see everything for yourself! What else! Today's women apparently know everything! The mutton was simply great! You are going to miss the last train. Did you notice? The curd was also brilliant! Was it from Gopal Sweets? Did you taste sarbhaja from Gopal Sweets? Yes. Wait for a while! Three minutes… show your watch… fifty eight seconds more! Then twelfth day of the lunar fortnight will start… After that starts the auspicious time… Whatever you do will be auspicious… Stay for a while! Should I go? To hell with twelfth day! You never said your family is so conservative! Why? Do you believe that there are only rules in the scriptures? You follow your belief… People in this house are crazy about the scriptures… I’ve not that much of belief… But I’ve heard that the scriptures mention... that on 'phoolsajya', one should not scold her husband… The scriptures say… not me… I’ve brought this for you… Like it? You look so good! Does Panchali... ...love King Bikramaditya? Not a bit… So much so for the twelfth day! What happened sister? Feeling unwell? Please give some water… Slowly… get up! Wait... A little while ago, didn’t you have water? After having water, one should not even step on the stairs of this temple… Thakurmashai, I’ve come from far! Haven’t had water since last night! Today, after I felt dizzy, they gave me a few drops… Without further discourse, just go away! I’ll not offer puja, just allow me to have a look… If one has to offer puja to Lord Shyam Sundar of Batasipur, she has to abstain from drinking water for more than twelve hours! Drinking even a drop of water means flouting of rules… Remember… there are only rules in the scriptures… but no provision for defying them… Go away! Stupid woman! Oh brother, you are spending all day doing this. Who upholds the culture of the country and the people? Who? The women! Today, women lack modesty… respect for rules… Earlier, I'd perform puja of the guardian deity in many houses… And now… only a handful of families call me! Heard that puja is now being done through songs! The 'Kalyug' has arrived! Even hearing such things makes you a sinner! Leave it! Send two bags of rice to my home… And in the night... the money collected in the pranami box! You’re the new bride? Have you paid homage to Gobindodeb? Done it? Just touched your folded hands with the forehead… is it? Such is the modern style of pranam! Go! Kneel down, touch your forehead with the ground to do pranam! O my God! That’s why no good work can be done by the foolish women! Don’t you know touching Narayan stone is prohibited for women? Why have you kept your hair untied? Why is your hair untied? Don’t you know untied hair attracts evil eyes? Whose eyes? Oh boudi, where shall I go? Their… their eyes… I had thought your daughter-in-law must be having some knowledge about the scriptures! Let alone the scriptures… going about with untied hair? That’s why I say, the nation whose women go to the dogs is also destined to get ruined! Thakurmashai, does the nation's responsibility rest on the hair of foolish women? Fool! Fool! Thakurmashai, please! O boudi dear! It’s evident that she knows absolutely nothing! 'Rajjotak'! Under such work pressure, is it possible to remember everything? What do I do if I forget? Now? No, no, no! You need not come now! Then I had told you by mistake… what can I do? Your best wishes are always there… but no! Please listen! Bhai is not there… you can’t meet him now! He has gone for honeymoon… Ok, Uma, I’ll let you know whenever he returns! I give you my word for that. Have I ever failed to keep my promise? I’m telling you… Ok, bye for now! I'm yet to decide where to go for honeymoon. There is so much work. Did you go to Ooty? Honeymoon for Bengalis means Di-Pu-Da (Digha-Puri-Darjeeling). Just wait for a second! Calling you in two minutes! Does Panchali have the slightest love for King Bikramaditya? Not at all... She has for sure… Listen! Boys in the vicinity do not play with me! Baghada and his friends taunt me… chant limericks as I return from school by rickshaw! What do they say my son? He himself is his friend The motherless boy is still not a brat! Baba, buy me a phone! I’ll only play games! I’ll not play outside the house any more! Listen! You’ll also tell them a limerick! What? Open your mouth! You’ll tell them… In order to say limericks, you need to have strength… and for that, you need to eat! That’s like a good boy! Namaskar! Today... you’ve filled up this fielding of Batasipur... Field! Field! It’s all the same… Yes! By filling up this fielding, you’ve proved that once again you’ve reposed confidence in me. I can do a lot for the development of the ladies of Batasipur… That’s nothing… I can do everything for the development of the ladies of Batasipur Like I’ve arranged the supply of pure drinking water for you… Haven’t I? Yes… For your progress, I’ll open ‘gynae’ here… I’ll make the health of the Batasipur ladies so lengthy... so that the ladies of Batasipur can go to the top... to the top… to the top... Called them? Yes, they are about to arrive. Slowly... O my my! I’ll die! Bring the painkiller. Bring the crepe bandage! Bring the hot water bag! Keep it there! What happened? Lakkhan Mondal… Quiet! First sit here! Lakkhan Mondal is not being able to compete with me politically… That’s why he has engaged people to shadow me… He is conspiring against me... And in the house traitor Bibhishon is already there… Ma has again quoted it wrongly. Keep your mouth shut. Oh! It’s hurting terribly! My dear boudi! Tomorrow itself I’ll hold a ritual! Then you’ll see how Lakkhan Mondal gets punished! But for Lakkhan please do not call me Bibhishon! The Ramayan is getting completely messed up! Please stop! Please! Oh my God! It’s paining! Is the ice ready? Namaskar! What’s the matter? What do you want? Sraddh! What? There! Lakkhan Mondal has sent you… isn’t it? Time for my sraddh has not come as yet! What did I tell you? See he has sent these people… But we’re searching for a priest! For performing my sraddh, isn’t it? Why are you searching for a priest here? Go to Batasipur's temple… Not a temple priest… slightly different… one who gives a musical performance… Musical priest… boudi, my dear? Never heard of it in my lifetime! Have you heard of a priest giving musical performance? Give… Have you heard? You? You’ve come to a wrong place… But some people showed us this house only… Then whose house is this? This? It is the house of the Panchayat Pradhan of Batasipur. A lot of time is still left for her sraddh. So you may leave now… Oh! Uhh……. Go… Just get out of this house immediately… Brother! Come! Stand here! Tomorrow please go to Bangamata College! Contact Sona Majumder in the Sanskrit department. But please never come to this house again! Go! Go away! How dare you? I’m asking you to leave and you’re not! So strange, Pishima! Priest who sings and dances! Only Brahma knows where these people come from! Who knows? Brahma! Do you remember your designated songs? 'Jirno'! We were pronouncing it wrong! Have you got the things tallied with the list? Shouldn’t I? Not being able to do things myself… naturally I’m worried! Now listen! This is highly important! Don’t accept any job near my house! Ok? They must be far from here! If my in-laws get to know, everything will be foiled! Don’t forget to take the incense… Do you go to college to burn incense? Actually… I teach Sanskrit… burning incense creates a spiritual ambience… Good! Good! Previously, Sanskrit professors used to teach Kalidas… do they teach 'dhunuchi' dance now? Good! Very good! Come, I’m going towards the college… I’ll drop you! No! No! I don’t need it! We’ll go the same way! But I’ll go the other way… because I’ll have to go to the other college… to bring their students to our college… because there is inter-college competition in our college… But you can advance on your way a little… Actually ma, everyone knows you… so they’ll ask how this happened… then they’ll ask about Lakkhan Mondal… Ok, ok! I’m getting late! Wherever I traverse, within your world, endless misery, death galore Pangs of separation prevail. Both birth and death are true. In Gita it has been said... we change our bodies... like changing clothes. If you could give me baba’s jobs of priesthood… What? What? You will perform the puja? Don’t you have a brother? Learnt performing puja from your father? Then you can do it… but let me ask my wife first. Puja? Pardon me… Really! She’ll perform puja! What? A woman priest will do the puja? Fie! Ram! Ram! Have you lost your head? A woman will do puja? Puja? Please do not mind! You’re a woman! It’s not possible for you to do the daily worship. It’s not possible for you to do the daily worship. You can help in the arrangement… but... would that be of any help? would that be of any help? Bye! Ma... You can do puja? My son has just appeared for a selection test. So, Satyanarayan puja will have to be done… I repeatedly requested the priest… He’s not ready to reduce the fees… I do not have any problem whether the priest is a man or woman… the poor do not have a choice… Will you chant the mantra in the right way? Ma! Ma! Come here. I’ve got the job! God resides in your mantra! Do you know how long has he been jobless? Your devotion has pleased God! The hidden arrow of that girl has struck the target One who doesn’t need crowd, she herself is equal to a hundred. With her sharp tongue she crosses the waves of jealousy I also secretly want to walk by her side. Whom will she address, some groaning for wrongs done. She will speak their language, the language of protest... She will be by their side! You move, move on... With the oath unwavering You say, come forward to speak up Chant the mantra of victory... Lakkhidi, please see who has come… So late? Where had you been? I… puja… For offering puja? Could have told me… I would have picked you up… Have you taken food? Come! Future called her – the opportune time has arrived... In spaces between rules smiles the light. With a fixed goal, the girl wants to break the walls to win You’re also very familiar, her near and dear one. Whom will she address, some groaning for wrongs done She will speak their language, the language of protest... She will be by their side! You move, move on, with the oath unwavering You say, come forward to speak up, chant the mantra of victory. Look this is an auspicious time! It’s no use arranging Rup's marriage – leave it! O my dear nanadini, looking so happy today? Today, we finalized Roop’s marriage! Oh! Is it? The boy is studying medicine… And the horoscopes match perfectly… That means 'Rajjotak'! Sit here! We’ve a lot more to discuss! You were not there! I had to do the make-up all by myself! You are looking so good. Have sweets! Today, they came to see Roop, why were you so late? Shabari, how did your inter-college competition go? Heard your rendering of 'Tomaro asheeme' was superb? One of your students told me… Have your tea… Yes… You also sing! Adi, the answers are wrong... do it again. Kakia, I’ll not do sums anymore! What have I taught you? Karmanye vadikarashte… Ma phaleshu kadachane...? Absolutely right… Do your work without thinking of the result! Even if the answers don't match, will it do? Great fun… eh? One slap… Start writing... Adi disturbs you a lot… Not a bit… May I ask you something? Sure… How did you know? My friend said... at her relative's last rites. At first, I couldn’t believe it… but that friend was all praise for you… What is your friend’s name? You will not know… It was in the same house, I might have seen. Uma… It’s not a male friend… ...female! Such male-female distinction is not right, Shabari! Kakia! I’m done! Let me see! Wonderful! Two women created history by entering Kerala’s Sabarimala temple. Today, they entered the temple at 3.45 am! Both of them are under 50 years of age! For the first time, women in their menstruating age entered Sabarimala! The society has completely lost it… Restriction on women for entering Sabarimala has been lifted! Is it necessary to play with the Gods? They commented that the restriction on women under 50 to enter the temple cannot be accepted as a religious instruction… Everyone has the fear of committing sin… Exactly... Not abiding by the rules means increasing one’s burden of sin… isn’t it? Not exactly… I don’t think rules and regulations are unquestionable… That’s not right… boudi! Just by seeing her outside, one cannot fathom her true nature! Who matched the horoscopes? Who said it was the most ideal match'? Those who cannot be discerned from outside... ...are actually very soft inside! 'Rajjotak'! Matched horoscopes to get her nephew married! What's your name? Manu Ghosh Roy. Where do you stay? Bali. You called me ma? Yes! Listen my son! Driver hasn’t come… your baba is also down with fever! On behalf of the party, a marriage invitation has come… Can you take me there? When will you go? Should I come at 8? Then I’m going to the shop… ok? Again… so sorry! You always come at the last moment! Here take it! You’ll get it! The word marriage means to carry the burden in a special way… Today, no man or woman has to carry his or her partner... Even if they do, both of them carry each other! Now hold each other’s hands tightly… like this… Hold! I can tell you from Tagore’s Chitrangada... If you keep me by your side in worries and wealth... If you allow me to help you in a difficult journey Then only will you be able to know me truly. Marriage is the start of this long journey of knowing each other. Was everything ok? Oh, yes! Akhilesh babu... Welcome madam! Most welcome! I just couldn’t think you’ll come with your son! Extend your hand… Hold it… now put it in the fire! Your elder son didn’t come? Everyone is busy with their own work! My daughter-in-law is a lecturer! A modern girl, as you know… My driver took ill, so I asked him to drive me here… Thank you! Please come! It's a new kind of wedding. You'll like it. Way for madam, please! Madam, here's a woman priest... she is very famous now. You could have avoided inviting me to such a marriage of sacrilege! There's regular puja in my house! Marriage is not a child’s play! Come Bikram! Madam! Won’t you have your dinner? Dinner! I’m worried about virtue and sin! Please madam! Please! Come Bikram! Now take a little vermillion and put it on his forehead! Tomorrow, Cycloni Fani is coming! Silently go to sleep! A good sleep softens people’s minds. God! Make it happen that way! Why is your phone switched off? I sent a message! What? I was worried! What else have you hidden from me? I perform puja... ...not theft or robbery! But you’ll not inform me for once? Haven’t I told you? What? On the very first day, didn’t I tell you on the terrace that I do puja? I thought you do puja at home… How do I know that you work as a priest? If you had known, you wouldn’t have married me… right? I would have surely… because you’re so different from others… You can see things differently, think differently… Because you’re different… This is how you’ve known me? Panchali… Never… never… never… Where is your daughter-in-law? Come out! Bring her! Woman priest, ridiculous! This cannot continue… Your house is adjacent to the holy Shyam’s temple… We respect you… But your daughter-in-law will do unholy practices… And you’ll expect us to accept that, it will never happen! What? What has Shabari done? In the name of theatre, she used to do business as a priest. We knew it… Day before yesterday, she conducted a marriage… that girl is now untraceable… Now tell us what will happen… You mean Akhilesh babu’s daughter, Sumi? Yes... Priesthood is a work of devotion… Contact with God can be established only if you’re pure in body and mind… Pardon me… I’ve to say this in front of so many women… But a woman’s body can never be pure… and so women can't be priests… It’s a lie… A lie... No scripture mentions that… Scriptures? You also know the scriptures? Chanting wrong mantra has caused this misfortune to the girl! Such dubious behaviour is not allowed in Batasipur! If need be, I will drag you by the hair and drive you out of the village… Shut up! I've studied the scriptures. I know that scriptures are not limited to the Manual of Priesthood! Scriptures include the Vedas, the Upanishad… From my childhood I know ‘shabda’ is ‘brahma’ – cosmic sound is the ultimate reality. The soul is indestructible! And everything ultimately converges in Brahma! I’ve studied Sanskrit. Don’t forget that I’m a lecturer of Sanskrit. I understand the nitty-gritty of puja. I also know the analysis of Gita’s shlokas… the meaning of every mantra! My goal is to emancipate priesthood from the clutches of patriarchy. Mind you, teaching in a college and working as a priest are not the same! In those 5 days of the month... Do you have an assistant in your business? Then how do you worship daily? My dear priest... Let’s then have a test… It will prove if at all Shabari knows anything or not. Then next Tuesday let her have a verbal duel with you! What are you saying? Thakurmashai… I’m telling you! I would not have agreed to this, but there has to be a befitting reply to this insult! From now on, better get the daily worship of your guardian deity done by some woman… when you do not have any qualms about impurity… This has already been discussed Thakurmashai! Dada, may I say something? Sure! When the debate is fuming around me, then I should also make something clear… the duel will happen. If I lose it, I’ll cease to work as a priest. But Thakurmashai, if you are defeated, then not only the daily worship of this house, I’ll also do the puja at the Shyam temple. Strange! Sharpen the other side! Ma, have you seen Roop? Problem? Ma, I was the agent of an insurance company… Everything was running fine… Many people made policies… But after the sudden shut down of the company, now it has become impossible to stay in my locality… Ma… aaaaaaa! Are you calling me or your company? Pishima... Are you going to do the marketing for Roop’s marriage today? Listen my son! Instead of thinking about your locality, think about your family! Be careful! Do not allow the goddess of misfortune to enter your house. Once she enters, then not only the locality, you can be thrown out of the entire universe! What are you saying ma? Roop! I’ve little children at my home… All of us will starve to die! Do something for me, my mother! You should have had a prior discussion with Shabari before finalizing the duel. There was hardly any time… What rubbish are you saying baba? Wouldn’t you have done it for ma? Shabari will win! How are you so confident? Didn’t have the chance to tell you, but I knew that Shabari is a priest… What? She performed the rituals at the sraddh of a friend's relative. No one has seen the performance of any sraddh so conforming to the scriptures… You never said it earlier? Did I ever have the chance to speak my words baba? Bikram, you must know one thing... Mugged-up lines are different from mantra chanted from your understanding… Don’t worry… Let the duel begin… Thakurmashai... Since the last 40 years, I’ve been doing puja at the Shyam temple… Then what’s the relevance of this duel today? I’m determined to stop this child’s play with puja. I know the scriptures and the rules of puja… Those who break the rules of the scriptures are mere fools! I’ve studied the scriptures from my father In the shades of the banyan tree of Gosaipur Scriptures not only mean mantra, but also the Vedas Just reverse it Thakur, Ved also means Dev. Brahma is the ultimate truth, Brahma means cosmic sound All hypocrites searching scriptures be doomed in this duel. Which is the puja that needs boats? Kojagari Lakkhi Puja with the humming of the owl! In which hand do we hold the flower and with which hand do the offering? We hold the flower in the left hand and make offering through the right. Can’t be completed in one year, takes three years to complete. Seeking a son, mothers stay awake night after night. Shall we ask for sons only and drive away the daughters? Give us healthy children in our laps, Kartick Thakur! Give light to the blind, knowledge to the devoted souls. Tell us the mantra to worship Rakkha Kali. Boudi dear! Say... What happened Thakurmashai? Why are you silent? Ok! Then let’s come to mantra… In Tantra, woman is for enjoyment… Tell me girl, the mantra for Chaturthi hom yagna! Bravo... Keep shut... Then tell us the name of the co-wife of Sri Kamala… These local stories are liked by women… In Lakshmi Puja make sure to avoid Tulsi leaves. Let’s get back to the mantra. In the institution of marriage, which mantra is said by the father to give away his daughter? What happened madam? Speak up! Shabari, why aren’t you answering? I know that you know… Give the answer… why are you silent? She would have said if she had known. Please speak up. Say it please. She has learnt the mantra for giving exams… small mistakes can always happen… The family becomes happy for the qualities of the woman Women are happy with oil and fire! Serving God is good, no good is yog... Brahmin’s work is to worship, woman cooks God’s food. Should we start counting three? Do we? One… It can’t be that you don’t know it… why are you doing it? Two… Say it… Three... Can’t bear to see tears in the eyes of women! Gurudasi! Gurudasi! Clear the house of all sins! Lost it, eh? Why didn’t you say it? Why? You foiled your own fight… And if you really do not know, you should not advance with the issue of woman’s priesthood! I remember, at the time of my marriage, Kanyadaan was skipped. You said Kanyadaan was not practised in your house! You might have not learnt it! Then your knowledge is incomplete… Why didn’t you say it? You didn't say because you didn't learn it. Baba! Why is this mantra chanted? Before that you tell me... who taught you this mantra? I never did for sure. I’ve heard it in marriage ceremonies… Just by listening, you memorized it? Yes! Please baba! Tell me why this mantra is chanted. This is a mantra for marriage, my dear! During marriage, when Kanyadaan is done, this is chanted. Kanya means daughter, isn’t it baba? Is it possible to give away the daughter? Will you give me away? Come here my dear! Come to me! Come! Listen! I’ll tell you something! You’re my daughter, isn’t it? Can I give you away? Is it possible? I’ll never give you away to anybody! Never! When you grow up like me… when you’ll conduct a marriage… never ever chant this mantra! Will you remember this? In life, accept the things that are good… and reject those that are bad… unnecessary… Ok? Have you understood? Never ever chant this mantra in front of anyone! Not being able to utter the Kanyadaan mantra doesn’t make your knowledge incomplete Bikram! You offer a cow and you offer your daughter… are these the same? Is it possible to give away the daughter? Is that right? Even today the girls have to be sent to the in-law’s place. But for that should they be considered a commodity? On the day of our marriage, I put a vermillion mark on your forehead… What I had always wanted is equality! A lot of people’s love and hopes are entangled with vermillion, the white and red bangles… I had never wanted to break these… My only wish was to break all discriminations to establish equality… And that too not out of ignorance or unreasonable doggedness… I knew, I understood and I read about it all… I had given my word to baba that I’ll never pronounce the Kanyadaan mantra in front of anyone… Today, when you said like that… Sorry Shabari… Come here! Be composed! Let there be mental calm! Since when were you seized by this ghost? Let these be discussed at some other time thakurjhi! Poor family… father had died… not knowing what to do she has done it! When in distress, people do all sorts of things… that’s true boudi, but it’s not right to play with deities, mantras and scriptures – isn’t it? And then she also doesn’t abide by the rules of those 5 days… But it’s no use accusing her only… Don’t you see what’s happening in Sabarimala? Fie! Fie! Is it too bad that a few women have entered the Sabarimala temple? Don’t retort! But I haven’t. I haven’t objected to any of your beliefs! But the discussion was being done about me… Yes, there was distress ma, but I was also educated! Before getting a job, I could have given tuition… But from childhood, I loved doing puja! Baba had taught me all with utmost sincerity… The way he taught is quite evident! He didn’t even teach you the mantra for Kanyadaan! Why don’t you stop thakurjhi? He had taught me very well Pishima, But he asked me not to chant the mantras that drag the society backwards… which includes the Kanyadaan mantra! I never wanted to make puja a child’s play. But the right to establish contact with God will rest only with the male Brahmins of the highest ranks none else – isn’t it discrimination Pishima? And the entire responsibility of eradicating that discrimination rests on your shoulders only? All the rules and regulations are all sanctimonious – isn’t it? Don’t you think they are? Of course, it’s all pretentious… Women cannot read Gita except for its eleventh chapter… women cannot read the Vedas… Where are these written? Ma, can you tell me? Nowhere. What remains is the dispute of holy and unholy. Ma Sarada while in her menses used to cook for Thakur… used to do her regular puja… Is it true? Absolutely… and it was not against the will of Sri Ramkrishna… rather according to his wish… Ram! Ram! Jai baba Samshan Raj, Jai baba Nandi Bhringi! Forgive her! She’s so young! She has said it not knowing what she is saying! Why are you so scared Pishima? I follow the Sam Veda in all my work… and the main thing about chanting Sam Veda mantras is song and rhythm. What does song and rhythm mean? Joy, delight… I’m not scared of the gods and goddesses! Ma, if you’re afraid of someone, can you love him? I don’t know whether you know it, but the Goddess herself is in menses, when the Ambubachi Puja is done. Women will only do the arrangements, cut fruits… But after learning Sanskrit, chanting mantras correctly they’ll never be allowed to do puja of the deities… Why? Can you tell me, ma? After the rain stopped My mind has got secretly burnt In my internal room... Dark eyes gathered clouds In the heart of shell In my internal room... In a soft cornstalk Sorrows get absorbed The bird of happiness on the cornice Suddenly disappears. Day hangs around searching Day doesn’t come Night comes at the dead of night In my internal room. You haven’t yet informed which song will you perform. Don’t delay, you are such a good performer… Anushuadi, please drop my name from the list. In the inconsolable eyeball, The blind loses the eyeliner Extends a slice of hand In the quiet world. The gold bangle So dear to me... Hides its face in the horizon. In my internal room. So, is Panchali fed up with everything? Having pickles? Playing cricket? What Panchali? Will you go for a ride with King Bikramaditya? I don't like this. Do you believe? What? Because of my priesthood Sumi is lost ? Are you a logical person? Then you sit back at home, study palms to give stones… Do you have such plans? Now just get up… Where’s your saree? Change quickly… Come… I’m waiting… Mother, ask him to give me leave Have studied a lot since the morning Now I will sit in your room To play the study game. Shabaridi, I didn’t know you’ve gone through so much… I... didn’t want to marry Ramen… Then? I love Shyamal… Shyamal Dolui. Shyamal is not a Brahmin. So no one took interest in getting us married. Ramen could understand everything. And I also told him everything. You know… it’s hard to find a good soul like Ramen. It’s true that our marriage didn’t last, but if there is friendship through the mantra of marriage, Then, Ramen is my eternal friend! He helped me get this job! Feeling relieved... that your marriage didn’t break because of me! Let Shyamal and you be very happy. And convey my love to Ramen! May I ask you a question? If I marry Shyamal... will you conduct the ceremony? No, actually... I’m not sure whether you marry a Brahmin and a scheduled caste! I get human beings married. Feeling scared! Why’re you afraid, my dear? My wife has gone to her father’s house for a week. No one will come. Only the two of us. But I’m scared! Why fear me? I’m the messenger of God! Serving me means serving God! Just see what have I got for you! I’m scared! I'm also… My wife! She is very quiet. Wife? Come! Just come outside! Today, you’ll be served right! Every day he brings a new girl. Why are you beating? No! I’m old… Yes! She’s old! See! She went away with the gold necklace! Who gave your marriage? I’ve forgotten! Hit you with a broomstick? How daring, mama! Mama! Who is he? Thakurmashai! I’ve not seen guruma getting so angry before! It all happened because of these women… That means women are not always fools… How intelligent they are! Went straight to guruma… Who’s guruma? Where has the girl gone from the bed, Brahma only knows! Who is Brahma? Your father! Shut up! Now drink! Thakurmashai! Revenge must be taken! Just at the right moment… When is the wedding? Have you written? Now write the name of Nimai Mondal …write plus 4! Just see! From Burdwan… Very good! Isn’t it beautiful? Brother, just look at it! Do you like that? It’s fantastic! Your boudi’s choice is always the best! Looking so sweet! Boudi! Just see! 20 hrs 42 min 52 sec... She has to sit for marriage before this, otherwise she will miss her opportune time for life! Thakurjhi! Why are you making such sinister statements? And listen! All the rules of marriage must be abided! And Kanyadaan is a must for me! Without Kanyadaan marriage is incomplete. It's evident... Brother... What? Will you do the Kanyadaan? Let the time come. Will you still allow the corrupt Thakurmashai to conduct the marriage? I heard the necklace he gave to the woman was stolen from the temple. Some rumours are true, not all! Besides, has there been a single marriage in this locality without Thakurmashai? But you’ll allow an unscrupulous person to do this? Look Bikram... What? What? A gold ring even if it’s twisted remains a gold ring! Wonderful! The character of a man – what’s that? Over and above, he’s the priest! I’m also a Brahmin… if I bring women here, you should not have any objection… isn’t it? Then let me bring a few girls here and dance with them? Then you should be happy! After all, it’s a gold ring. Even if it’s a little twisted, how does it matter? Where are you going? Please come to my room… He himself is his friend... Even without mother, the boy is not spoilt. He himself is his friend... Even without mother, the boy is not spoilt. Hello! Will you play one ball? Toto uncle, please let me get down! He can't even get down alone! The dumbo is coming! Give me the bat, Baghada. Will not be able to even lift it! Why do you make loneliness look so small? However large your team may be, What is Bagha without Goopi? Day and night you talk about love... Friend, what is love? May I ask you something? Oh yes! Tell me… I was saying… Uma… Why do you have to avoid it? Excuse me! Perhaps I should not discuss this… But whenever I go to your room to leave Adi there, I hear you talking over the phone… Why don’t you marry? Adi disturbs you a lot …isn’t it? Do you think like that? Do people marry only for children? Don’t they do it for themselves also? And even if you marry, I’m not leaving Adi… Uma and I used to study in college together… We liked each other! And then I had to marry Bakul under family pressure… Bakul was a wonderful girl… She passed away after giving birth to Adi! Everyone in the family liked Bakul very much! Since then, my life centres around Adi… Umadi has not married? No… Can’t see the saree for the turmeric ceremony. Oh! It’s lying in my room. I’ll get it from there. Come for my sister’s wedding on June 2. I can't discuss this on the phone. There is a problem. Also, It's not a wrong date like my brother's wedding. Lakkhidi, please pass the Healthy & Tasty Mustard Oil can. Got a good groom eh? Honestly! Thakurmashai has fled! Our Chhoto baba has seen! Ask him! Yes! I’ve seen! An aunty was standing outside! He went with her! Lakkhi! Take him away! His phone is switched off. The twisted gold ring became loose and very naturally it has dropped! Instead of making unnecessary comments, should we not search for another priest? Could you find anybody? No baba, can’t find anyone! Whom will you find at the last moment? Boudi! My Roop will become 'lagnabhrashta'… For heaven’s sake, do something! We’re here! Why are you doing like that? Amaraboti... May I say something? Instead of sticking to your unreasonable obstinacy, go to the person who can still save us and request her… Not till I’m alive! Baba is saying the right thing! Why are you being adamant? No! Strange! Let’s go downstairs! You have remained obstinate all your life. Boudi! After Roop’s father deserted me... you’ve sheltered us! You’ve brought up my Roop… Today, please do this for her… Ok! You need not say anything to anyone, I’ll request… Just give me the permission to do it! Otherwise my girl will miss the auspicious moment for life! Gurudasi... Go! Go! Where is Thakurmashai? The auspicious moment is about to pass. Thakurmashai is on the way! Will arrive in a moment! Shyamalda has come… Listen! Roop is very dear to me Pishima! I’m not keeping anything in mind… But honestly, I cannot say the Kanyadaan mantra… Without Kanyadaan the marriage will remain incomplete… In this day of crisis, I can even accept that! Please do that! The auspicious moment is about to pass! Let me touch your feet… Pishima! What are you doing? My daughter will be 'lagnabhrashta'! Pishima, there’s nothing called 'lagnabhrashta'! Please do not mind my saying this. Dada must have been married at the right lagna! Horoscopes must have matched perfectly! Still baro boudi passed away! Horoscopes were tallied even in your case… what happened? Ok! I don’t have any objection! But boudi… I don’t have any objection either! I... give my consent! A woman priest will conduct the marriage? Actually... Why won’t she? Women are becoming ministers, they’re going to the space, winning Olympics and can’t act as a priest in a marriage? One more thing… We do not allow Kanyadaan in this house. Strange! Is a marriage possible without Kanyadaan? Why not? This marriage is between your son and my daughter… now you’re not giving away your son! Similarly, we’re not giving away our daughter! Besides, daughter is not a commodity that can be given away… Now start… This heart of yours, May it be mine. Let the good-natured girl be a little dare-devil... Let’s hail the change for a new day. Let them show the power of mantra And laugh at the society... Will they do household chores only? Do they have no significance? We can open the window And break superstitions like a toy. No more kanyadaan from today Groom and bride be on the same plane. Uma! How are you here? You sent me the SMS to come here… Come… You’ve made me indebted to you for the entire life… What’re you saying Pishima? Roop is my sister also! Thank you so much… For saving our face… Don’t remember any of the previous incidents… Ma it’s such a happy day… let's not get into it. Does one remember the words her own people? O my dear! Pishima! Instead of Thakurmashai, I do the puja at Batashipur's Shyam Sundar temple… Ma and Pishima are always there. Oh, that reminds me! Have put the milk on fire… It will get curdled… Instead of showing me his palm, better take him to the doctor… ok? Roop’s marriage was perfect… After marriage, she joined college… For the ‘ladies’, I mean women of Batashipur Ma indeed facilitated the opening of a maternity ward. Father-in-law had been the silent supporter. Our little Goopi and Bagha have come together forgetting their rivalry and have been winning tournaments. Our terrace has become far more beautiful with the amorous talks of dada and Umadi and their selfies… And me? Now I openly ride the chariot of the king to go for my work as a priest. Looking nice... Does King Bikramaditya love Panchali? A fairy tale usually ends with the birth of a beautiful prince, but from now on if you pay heed you’ll find how the princesses are also sailing smoothly with their stories in an open sky of the fairy tales.
