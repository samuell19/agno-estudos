Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! All right, boys! Oh, yeah! All right. Oh, yeah. You were the lead singer of the New York Dolls. A lot of people credit you guys with really helping to start the punk movement. Well, yeah, but inadvertently, like, we didn't do it on purpose. We were in Newcastle and it's a place in England where they make this beer called Newcastle Brown Ale. And we were young men and we had a reputation of being able to hold our booze. So they say, "Oh, boys, you gotta try the local brew." And they give you these gigantic cans of Newcastle Brown Ale. And we're at like the Newcastle Polytechnic Institute or something for a show. We're drinking these things. "Have another one." OK, Ok, another one. So we drank maybe 10 of these things... and... Maybe, maybe 10. We go on stage to play and everything is going fine. All of a sudden, the drummer barfs about 12 gallons of Brown ale onto his snare drum, but he keeps playing. And so, you know, a good dollop of it hits me right in the nose and you know how that is, it's like a chain reaction. Yeah, I know how that is. Why would I know how that is? I don't know how that is. Well, I let loose and then the bass player let loose, the guitar player let loose, the audience was like... Everybody's throwing up and at the end of the song, everybody's like, "Yeah!" And they thought it was part of the act and then all the kids in England started doing this. It became the rigor of, uh... Oh, we gotta throw up like The Dolls! You know, that kind of thing. And that's... that's how the punk movement was born. I would say that was the... if you wanted to bring it down to a moment in time, that was the moment. It's super sensuous, transcendental something not to be explained in rational terms. It's the Mansion of Fun show. I hear that melody On the street My melody Soft and sweet Your melody, would you sing that song to me Melodies hauntin' me Memories just repeat Your melodies even haunt me in my sleep I tried to show you, you just couldn't see it I tried to tell you, but your heart couldn't hear it I tried to love you, but ya Your heart had to slip away Now that melody's hauntin' me Melody got that beat The memory just repeats in my mind A melody, where I dance In the place that I find romance Your melody just won't give me a chance I tried to show you, but your heart couldn't see it I tried to tell you, but your heart couldn't hear it I tried to love you, but your heart had to slip away Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah Melody Yeah, yeah, yeah Melody Yeah, yeah, yeah Well certain songs I just can't take it They start to play and my old heart starts achin' Certain songs, I just can't fake it They start to play and I just want to break 'em I just can't take it When I hear them play that song Yeah that melody Haunting me A tender rhapsody, soft and sweet The memory follows me 'Til it's insanity Driving me Now my melody's on the street Oh, melody, soft and sweet Oh, melody Yeah, yeah, melody Yeah, my melody Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah Where am I? Who am I? Ahhhh, ahhhh Ahhhh, ahhhh Well, I'm stranded in the jungle I'm trying to keep a date With my little girl, that was back in the States I'm stranded in the jungle, I'm afraid of it all Wondering how I could get a message back home But how was I to know that the wreckage of my plane Had been picked up and spotted By the girl on Lover's Lane I said, meanwhile, back in the States Baby, baby Let's make romance Your old-time love hasn't got a chance I said he's stranded in the jungle, bad as he can be Come on, pretty darling, just you and me Oh yeah, oh yeah Meanwhile, back in the jungle... Ahhhh, ahhhh Ahhhh, ahhhh Why come to a New York Dolls show? A lot of kids are like whipped dogs and they feel like they're really terribly alienated And I think we give 'em a feeling that they're not the same people that feel these feelings not the only people that feel these feelings and that they're not alone. They all can come together on our show and see each other and meet each other. There's a thousand bands that are coming up like from the streets, from the ghetto. 1,2,3,4! Trash, go pick it up Take them lights away Trash, go pick it up Don't take your life away Trash, go pick it up Don't try to take my knife away And please don't you ask me if I love you If you don't know what I'm doing What you know is Trash, go pick it up... Now, is it true that you were president - of their fan club? - No. Not at all. Well, were... were you involved in their fan club? No. Not even slightly. - A member? - Not even a member. Tempted to send off of town for four months? - Yes, it's all true. - Yeah. - It's all true. - It is true. You were in the fan club, you denied it. - But it's true, isn't it? - I, I, I, I, I... was the fan club. I was the fan club. And what was it that drew you to The New York Dolls? Well, they were very violent. They were very witty and they were very intelligent. And as you know, most pop stars are not very intelligent. and they're not very witty and not very violent. Right. And why-ha-hy ha-ha ha-hy Why do you hang around I'm so sorry I-I-I-I'm so sorry It was a good lay, good lay Ah ha Do you remember when you first saw the Dolls? Mm, yes. I had gone to see them live in '72, but their drummer had died three days earlier. And everybody was expecting the Dolls to walk on the stage. And of course they didn't. There was just suddenly an announcement that Billy had died and everybody just collapsed. And then the next encounter was television. They, they appeared very famously on The Old Grey Whistle Test which in those very dark days of '73 was a fantastic vision. People forget how absolutely dank things were, how dank life was and pop art was. And there was no, there was no sense of danger within pop music at all. But I was obsessive. I was, I was ridiculously obsessive. This, this was the band for me. This was the turning point for me. Why have so few people heard New York Dolls? This is a blighted band. I'd almost say cursed because if you listen to, if you listen to, to, to the... the music they made, every single song is really a hit single. And there's no reason on earth why it shouldn't have happened. But because they were connected with drugs and absurdly transgender issues. So here were boys who were calling themselves "Dolls" and they looked like prostitutes, male prostitutes, which at the time, you have to remember, it was a long time ago and all... and all of that kind of thing was really taboo. And if a man walked down the street wearing women's clothes, he could be arrested and thrown into jail. That's why they only made two studio albums. And for a group who did so little really and existed for such a short amount of time, their impact has been extraordinary. And the music, because it was such fantastic pop music, it, it just seemed to me like the absolute answer to everything. Which of course... too dangerous. I just want to be like very welcoming. 'Cause the way the society is, I mean, it, it was set up is like very strict, like... straight, gay... whatever, vegetarian, whatever you want to, you know, anything you want to say. I just wanted to kind of like bring those walls down and... and have a party kind of a thing. Oh, man, this is great. This is very nice. This is a classy bo?te, the Caf? Carlyle. And we are starting our semi-annual bisexual... What am I talking about? Bi-annual residency. And the cafe called Mara, who runs this whole shebang up here and asked if we'd like to come back. She said, "Yes." No, we love it here because, I'll tell you why, you take the elevator to work. My whole life I've been schlepping. Oh, in some ungodly conveyances. Then came the... the question of what kind of a repertoire we would present because you have to have a new one every year. And I was in no mood for learning 20 songs. There's only so many hours in a day. So we decided that we would do Buster Poindexter... That's me... singing the songs of David Johansen... that's me. Because I know those songs. And so here we are, both of us. And... tonight, I'm gonna do songs that I wrote or co-wrote, I guess from when I was a teenager, all the way up to now. And the one thing I could say, the unifying thing of my existence, is that there's always been plenty of music. That's nice. Very nice. Feeling a great sadness today I don't want to shush it or shoo it away It belongs to the whole world, the boys and girls It ain't just mine Like joy and love, it's always there I don't know how I tune in, or why that I care But I can't pretend it don't feel like the end And everything is fine I feel exiled from the divine Me and these sad friends of mine We're just waiting down here, drinking beer And losing time Well, I hear plenty of music I see superfluous beauty everywhere Why should I care What does it matter to me Yeah, yeah. All right, now. The myth of life is a song Yeah! And nature, too, that's the song All right. Don't you destroy the song 'Cause when the song is gone You'll be gone too I don't know how it went astray Seem like the whole world is an ashtray Floatin' around Some broken-down, low-end galaxy I don't know what I did to get sent here Must have been some bad that I done There in the world gone mad Feeling sad I guess I'm sorry I don't need no one to love me Or place theirself above me What does it matter, I don't need a ladder What's it to me I hear plenty of music I see superfluous beauty Everywhere So why should I care What does it matter Yeah, I hear plenty of music I see superfluous beauty Everywhere Why should I care What does it matter to me What's it matter to me Nothing matters to me What's the matter with me Oh! Beautiful. Beautiful. Poor boy Poor boy Poor boy long way from home When I was down in Louisiana Just doing as I please Now I'm in Texas I got to work or leave Poor boy You actually knew Harry Smith? Well, I didn't really know him, but I met him a couple of times. You went to his place at The Chelsea? Yeah, probably, yeah. What was his room like? It was kinda like, you know, a speed den, I think at the time. You know, like when I was a kid you would go to The Chelsea and you'd get stuck in there for like a week, going to different people's rooms and stuff. I was probably 18 at the time, you know, so I would like to go see people that were generally older and could impart some kind of wisdom. Was Harry Smith one of those people? Well, I, you know... He could have been. - Who's this? - Who's who? This guy. - Oh, that's Harry Smith. - Oh. He was, you know, like a polymath. This guy was into a lot of really good shit. He would be into something and then he would be like through with it, you know? When he was young, he started out, he would hang with the Lummi people. He recorded their traditional music and he made a lot of like experimental films later on. He would put ads in newspapers around the country, asking people if they wanted to get rid of their old 78s that were in the attic. I mean, you know, he was the kind of guy who would collect string, you know what I mean? His record collection is pivotal in the American music and rock and roll and the folk boom in the 50s. Everybody who wanted to be a folk singer in the 1950s would learn songs from those records. And there was a lot of different kinds of songs. He picked like, you know, really strange tunes. You recorded a lot of songs from the Harry Smith record collection and you named your band The Harry Smiths. Would you say that he's someone who inspired you? Not at all. Well, you're very averse to... No, because he was such a grouch, this guy. I mean, I liked a lot of the stuff he did, but I never thought, "Oh wow, I wish I could do that." Poor boy Poor boy I grew up in Staten Island in a house that my grandfather built. We had a lot of records in the house. Music was on all the time. You know, sometimes there would play a show while we were having dinner or something, you know. What about your dad singing? What about it? Like, did you sing with your dad around the house? Uh no, not so much, but he was a very good singer. He used sing like light opera like Gilbert and Sullivan. He knew a lot of operas. How old were you when you had your first band? Thirteen or fourteen. We used to play at you know, like school dances and we used to go into the "Battle of the Bands." We always used to come in second because this other group from the ass end of Staten Island, used to play these songs with like The Ventures, like with the guitars behind their head, which I always saw felt like, that's really a lame gimmick. But... they won every time. I remember the first time we played I remember the first song, Boogaloo Down Broadway by the fantastic Johnny C. - You know that song? - No. Baby, oh baby Boogaloo down Broadway Yeah, yeah, funky Broadway I closed my eyes for the whole first song... and then I could hear them all applauding and I opened my eyes and I was like, "Oh, they like it." OK, here we go. I'm gonna just reminisce for a minute here, but... ...it's my birthday today. And I'm such a sentimental old fool. I was recalling how when I was like 16, my friends and I went to... and I had a very interesting group of friends, kind of like Maynard G. Krebs type people. The New York Avant Garde Festival was... held on the ferry boat. So we went to see Charlotte Moormon play the cello topless. That's the kind of crowd we ran with. We liked a little culture with our pornography. So a friend of mine said, "I work for a guy over there and he's looking for somebody else to work there." It was a little store on St. Mark's Place called Matchless and it was run by a fellow named Lore Wilson. And it was nice. They had tchotchkes, you know, around the store. And I was sent down to the basement to work, which was like... very dark, dank, stonewalls... like it was dug out of rock... with moss and water dripping down. It was a Dickensian hell. And my job was to cut logos off of beer cans and soda cans, like Pepsi, and then put a fastener on it and make earrings out of them. It was kind of pop art jewelry. But I noticed that along the walls there were racks and on the racks were these big fat lush boas. There was a huge sequined phallus. There was... all kinds of headdresses and costumes. And so I said, "Lore, what's the deal with this... cosplay stuff over here?" And he said, "Oh, well I'm the costume designer for the Ridiculous Theater and these are costumes for their next production." I think it was Whores of Babylon, or Conquest of the Universe, or something. So I said, "Oh, can I go to the rehearsal with you?" And he said, "Oh yes." And then I met the most fabulous people I think that I could ever have imagined at that point. So I said, "Lore, I'm not gonna be coming back tomorrow." I was like, "I'm gonna stay over here at the theater." And... sometimes I would do the sound and... sometimes I would do the lights, sometimes I would nod out while I was doing the sound and Charles Ludlam would have to like... give me my cue like three times. "And then the thunder rolled." "The thunder rolled!" And then I would go. Sometimes I was a spear carrier and went on stage. It was just great. And one time I was sharing a dressing room table with Candy Darling and Black-Eyed Susan was complaining about her waitressing job. And Candy said, "I've been a lot of low things in my life, but I've never been no waitress." I went from hell to heaven, you know, it was fantastic. OK, baby. Yeah, yeah. Temptation to exist Give me another kiss Tell me how you love me A mesmerizing kiss That I can't resist Say I'm the way you want me So I can breathe your perfume Dancing with you 'round the room Long after a masquerade All right, baby. Stripped of facade and costume The drag with being born It's really not a thorn Baby, it's a dagger Most people would deny Say it's a piece of pie To you it doesn't matter I hear about all the sad affairs Up on the heights of despair Someone's always perishing Ah... By the self they've assumed All right Ray, let's go. Oh! Yeah, baby! Aw yeah. Heh-hey! Temptation to exist Obsession to persist Death-defying romance Give me another kiss Show me what I miss Baby, since our last dance So I can get back in tune All right. Dancing with you 'round the room Long after the masquerade All right, baby. With no facade, no costume Here we go, boys. Ray Grappone, everybody, Ray Grappone on whistling and drums. Ray, I would whistle with you anywhere. Well, thank you, boss man. You know, Ray and I have been practicing in the shower and it's coming together really well. - Oh, Thomas! - Did he say that? - Thomas everybody. - Thank you. You are a living legend. Oh, oh, oh... God bless you. If you need anything here at the Caf? Carlyle, ladies and gentlemen, just slip Thomas a "C" note and he'll take care of it. - I love you, thank you. - Same to you. What a class joint. Oh, this is great. I'm used to playing the 2:00 AM show in the Boom Boom Room. You know what I'm saying? Boys, we're in top form tonight. Have you noticed? This is The Boys in the Band Band. Well, have you heard of a fellow named Morrissey? If you haven't, I'll clue you in. He was the teenage president of the New York Dolls fan club in England. He's kind of a Gloomy Gertie. But he loved him some Dolls, you know what I'm saying? And still does. So... he called me and he said, "I understand you're a pretty big Maria Callas fan." And I said, "Yes, I happen to be known for that in certain circles." And he said, "Well, you know that film she made where she did a fantastic concert at the Royal Festival Hall?" I said, "Yes, by heart." He said, "How would you like to play the Royal Festival Hall?" I said, "Yes, I would." He said, "Well, all you have to do is get the Dolls back together." And I thought, Royal Festival Hall, Maria Callas. I combed every opium den in Chinatown and I pulled that band together. We were fantastic. It was a big success. They added a second show. Then... it was the beginning of the summer and all these festivals in Europe were starting where they play in the fields. I didn't know about these things. They called, "Would you play?" And I said, "Well, of course we would." We were up and running. We went all over the place. Then we went all over the world. Then we went all over the world three times. And I was like, "OK, you know, I've really seen enough of this world. I want to go home, thank you." I came home, my liver was like... So, I'm just saying this because like if you haven't seen me around, that's why. One, two, three, four... Oh! That was some segue. My baby I don't talk nasty about her You ain't even got no class I'm gonna kick your ass All 'cause my baby Oh, wait a minute, I fucked it up. I fucked it up. I fucked it up. It's all my fault. I was thinking of another song, I was thinking of a Jimmy Rogers song. Who's so fly up in the sky Faster than any boy could ever describe Who's got that love so deep With everything alive, I said Jet boys fly, jet boys gone Jet boys stole my baby Flying around New York City so high Like he was my baby This is the kind of place where no one cares What you're living for And Jet Boy's so preoccupied He don't care about before And that's why Jet boys fly, jet boys gone Jet boy stole my baby Flying around New York City so high Like he was my baby My baby - Yes. - Very nice. Fantastic. I've never seen anything like it. Yes, you've never seen. Happy memories looking back? What is that? What feelings are you feeling? I feel invincible. Yes. Didn't you once get arrested for impersonating a woman? Well, it was in Memphis, as I recall, right? But you weren't impersonating a woman. I wasn't, I was kind of dressed like Liza Minnelli at the time. He invited everybody on the stage and he got arrested for that in Memphis, Tennessee. But they, they pegged it on dressing like Liza Minnelli? Yeah, I had to go to jail dressed like Liza Minnelli and Memphis jail is not Mayberry. It's a real jail. No if you went to like the thrift store or something, you would most likely have to buy women's clothes to look like a rockstar, you know? It's interesting that you guys, that you thought that you had to wear women's clothes. Well, we didn't have to but there was nothing else available. You know, if Granny Takes a Trip, had opened an outlet, then we could have wore men's woman's clothes. But we used to kind of improvise, you know. Come on, boys! Were there places where, or times where it felt a little more risky or dangerous? Well... Or you might get beat up? Yeah, I mean, the first time we played outta town we played at some like club in Long Island. It was called like The Shark or something, I don't remember what it was called. It was just like a big room, like a warehouse kind of room. And when we pulled up, there was all these like muscle cars and stuff, pack of cigarettes stuck in the shirt that was rolled up kind of a thing. And I was like, "Oh man, people still doing this?" And we started to play and all the guys moved towards the back and the girls moved towards the front. Somethin' happened. I don't even remember what, but the guys started beating the hell out of each other and then they opened up the doors on either side - and pushed everybody out. - Why? Because of the sound? The look? What was so bad? It kind of caused a lot of sexual tension, I think, between guys and girls. It was a mess. The thing about the Dolls, the original Dolls, was that we all had very kind of similar ideas about what it takes to be a great rockstar. People who are really campy, but you know, it's an old expression, but it's like the lie that tells the truth, you know? And it just kind of gets to the point. Baby, up all night Baby, New York City Baby, so so high Baby, so so high Don't you know that Like he was my baby Like he was my baby Like he was my baby I remember during this period when we were having this reunion thing, the Dolls, we got a call from one of our myriad record companies. Every time we do a record, we get dumped. So, they said, "Would you like to go to the island of Kauai, Hawaii and make a record at the home of Todd Rundgren?" I said, "Yes... now? Like now? January now." "Yes." Showed up a few days early. Todd was kind of pissed, but fuck him. You know what I'm saying? Who does he think he is? So he said, "OK, what do you... play me what you got. What do you got?" I said, "We don't have nothing, man. We'll get right to it though." So, it was great. It was verdant. It was lush. I don't know if you saw it in Architectural Digest, but Todd's house, it looks like a Cambodian drug lord's pagoda. It's beautiful. I was like, "Man, a gentleman of my stature belongs right here." You know what I'm saying? We went back to the Bay of Honah Lee. You know who lives there, don't you? Puff. Oh, yeah. We hung with Puff a little bit there, baby. It was cool. Normally it rained every day. But intermittently, at intervals. Usually, it stopped raining when it was time for us to go in the studio and make some noise with the pots and pans, but it was it was still beautiful. Anyway, we wrote this song there. It's a good one. It's gonna be really good. Hate how the myth of separation Really cast a spell on me Never missing one occasion Of the infinite varieties of agony We pass on down our borrowed anguish Our blasted joys, our jubilant despair Leave us crying out here to languish Poor outcast, it's too much to bear Making rain Yeah, making rain It's always raining here Sometimes I need a little shove, yeah Remind me of my providence Learn to bear the beams of love, yeah Mending my conflict with circumstance Just making rain Yeah! Yeah, making rain It's always raining here The heart's in pain Crying in the rain Here comes that rain again Exacerbations, excruciations That's the tears of things Yeah, baby. Exacerbations, excruciations Well, that's the tears of things Very nice. Waiting in a subway station In some godforsaken neighborhood It's as if my blood was dreaming And resolved itself into melody Yeah, making rain Here comes the rain It's always raining here Our hearts in pain Yeah, findin' the rain Oh, the rain Yeah, the rain It's always raining here Oh, the rain Yay... Yeah, it's always raining here Yeah, baby. Yup. Keith Cotton, everybody, on the piano. You know, when I was 18, I started hanging around at this place, Max's Kansas City. It was kind of like this place. Great people. My kind of people, you know what I'm saying? Like, it was probably the greatest bo?te of all time after Caf? Carlyle. But still up there in the top two. It was a lot like this actually. It was a lot like this. Some of the greatest queens you'd ever wanna meet. Oh, my god. I remember one night... I believe it was... Penny, you'll correct me if I'm wrong. Because Penny Arcade was there as well this evening. It was Ingrid Superstar? It was you, Bill Vehr and Ingrid Superstar and me. OK, Penny and I, my friend Bill Vehr from the Ridiculous Theater. The author of Turds in Hell. He was my best friend at the time. We were biffing. And Ingrid Superstar. And Ingrid said, "You're on a trip. You're on a trip. You're on... everybody here is on a trip except for me." And Bill very calmly said, "But, Ingrid Superstar, you took eight Tuinals." She said, "Yeah, but I'm not on a trip." Anyway, I found that amusing, you know. So much so, that I recall that after all these years. Something about certain turns of phrase in language that are peculiar to each of us. Written for you, Tina Louise. - What's my real name, Duchess? - I don't know. You really like to destroy people, don't you? Everybody you would meet would be alive, freewheelin' and so much stuff going on. So that after you've come six times, six times, you're gonna find out that you're Superman, you see. There's something wrong with this. Charles Ludlum came to the show one night and he just said, "I'm having a personality crisis." And I thought, "That's really good." And I kind of remembered it, you know. Here, let me pull through the bottom. I remember when I moved into my first apartment, which was a seventh-floor walkup on the Hells Angels block. I turned on the radiator and it just like started hissing steam I really didn't know what to do about it. And so, I knocked on, I guess it was my neighbor's door, or two doors down and this guy came in. He was like a college professor, but kind of like, you know, a hip college professor kind of guy. He was very nice and very political. He told me that I should check out his group, which happened to be the Up Against the Wall Motherfuckers. I said, "OK." And he kind of like would encourage me because apparently, I had the stuff to rally the street if something went down, so I used to stay on the corner, like go climb up a lamppost and say, "We're not gonna let these cops, blah blah blah blah blah blah blah." And everybody'd be like, "No, no." And then there'd be like some kind of a... skirmish or whatever. And my mother said to me about them, she said, "You know what you are? You're a commie dupe." I had to think like, "Yeah, maybe." Maybe I was. There were so many characters on St. Mark's Place in, you know, '69,'70. I used to really like Abbie Hoffman a lot when I was a kid. Did you meet him first? Yeah, I used to see him all the time. He was very personable. We planted a tree in the middle of St. Mark's Place. He was the instigator of that. The ruse of it was that we need more trees on St. Mark's Place. He said, "Where're we gonna get a tree?" I said, "They got trees all over Staten Island." He got a van, came to Staten Island, dug up a tree like in the Greenbelt or something where there's a million trees. And did you put it in like a bucket or did you... No, I think they just put a mound of dirt around it, as I recall. They didn't expect it to stay. It was in the middle of the street. Like they just wanted to like do something. We went to Lincoln Center. It might have been the opening of Lincoln Center. You know, those like industrial boxes of Tide like they have at a laundromat so you can buy like a cupful or whatever? They dumped one of those in the fountain. And it just like started, it was like a comedy movie. It just like started foaming up and all these people who were like, you know... uh... society contributors to Lincoln Center, right? They were all done up to the nines and they were all like slipping in the foam. And it was great. It was so beautiful. There was a lot of liberation movements in the East Village in those days. They were all kind of interesting, so... But the Yippies were the most ridiculous, you know, so that appealed to me and Charles Ludlam was ridiculous and that appealed to me. Ridiculousness is something that I've always kind of, especially, if it's really intelligent ridiculousness it's kind of appealing to me. We've really expanded all definitions and all mediums to where that you have to forget those definitions that you learned in school. But you got to forget that, folks. So, you got to forget the definition of art, the definition of music, the definition of video art now. All these things are being expanded every single day. Music does not aim at sound itself, but is in a complex conception. First, forget about sounds. Sounds must be free. The goal of today's Mansion of Fun show is to live with godlike composure on the full rush of energy, like Dionysus riding the leopard without being torn to pieces. Hey, Leroy! - What? - Your mama. She's calling you, man. You know, when I was a kid, I lived on East Sixth Street. Before that, I lived on Third Street on the Hells Angels block. Not my cup of tea. I mean, it was all right. But... one day there was a knock at the door, which was in the kitchen, which is also where the bathtub was located. I opened the door and there stood this big viking who was wearing a tutu and paratrooper boots and some like ripped yellow tights. Next to him was this little Colombian guy. He was kind of like cleaning his nails with a stiletto. But still I thought, "I gotta watch out for this big guy." Turned out though it was the little guy I had to watch out for. Anyway, it was Arthur Kane and Billy Murcia. And... Thank you. Arthur said to me, "I understand you're a singer." I didn't really expect that voice, you know, to come out of this Cossack. I said, "Yeah, I like to sing." He said, "Well, we're trying to start a band and we need a singer." And I said, "OK, I'm in." I mean, you know, I made snap decisions in those days. You know, like later on in life you start thinking, "Well, what's this gonna be like in six months?" You know? This is like, at that point like, "What's this going to be like" let me do the arithmetics. Fifty years later, you're still like, "Oh my God, what was that?" So we went over to 10th Street where Johnny Thunders had a very nice apartment. The bathtub was in the bathroom, you know what I'm saying? Couple other rooms. I think his mother was paying his rent. I mean, I'm not sure, OK? So don't quote me on that. New York Dolls guitarist Johnny Thunders was found dead on the floor of a guest house in the French Quarter of New Orleans on Tuesday afternoon. The cause of death hasn't yet been determined. But Thunders, whose given name was John Genzale, had a longtime drug habit. Our will is hard Man, it's so hard And it's a lonely planet joy When you bring a song from your other boy That's when I'm a lonely planet boy And I'm tryin' For your love Whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah You pick me up You're out drivin' in your car I tell you where I'm going You're always telling me It's too far But how could you be drivin' Down by my home When you know I ain't got one And I'm so all alone Whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah All right. Well, it's a lonely planet joy When you bring the song from your other boys That's when I'm a lonely planet boy and I'm tryin' Yeah, cryin' Baby for your love Whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah Oh, yeah! Whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah Can't you hear me callin' When I'm a thousand miles away I don't wanna stay I'm thinking of words I gotta say 'Cause I wanna be there with you I know what to bring you I remember From the days I got over Everything Whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah Well, it's a lonely planet joy When you bring a song from your other boys That's when I'm a lonely planet boy And I'm tryin' Yeah, I'm cryin' Oh, can't you see that I'm dyin' Baby, for your love Whoa, whoa whoa, yeah Whoa, whoa, yeah Whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah Let me tell you about the time I met Mara, all right? My life was going along kind of like Groundhog Day. I didn't really see much reason to continue and then I met Mara and oh my God, you know? I don't believe it. I don't believe it. I love you, Mara. I love you. Always will. It was a scandal. Oh my God. But... so worth it. So anyway, I wrote this... I wrote this lyric... for my love. Been cravin' more life And more love That lives in the soul Of my heart I don't wanna be No artist I'm a dancin', singin' A work of art Yeah, you lit my heart With fiery aggression and you showed me This feeling of love Of sex and affection that ya owed me Danger And I ain't scared In danger I found the splendor there I was dancin' on a flamin' pit Dancing We are creating it We're dancing Right on the lip Of a volcano Nature with its true voice cries out undissembled Be as I am Revealing its wildest most generous incarnation In danger Devil may care Danger The fire's everywhere 'Cause we're dancing Atop a flamin' pit We're dancing We are creating it We're dancing Right on the lip Of a volcano Oh yeah. All right. Yeah, man. All right, man. Oh, yeah! Oh! In the center of action of my psyche's need for love I want liberation and joy In a paroxysm of intoxication Inspiration ain't no way to be coy In danger A blazing glare Oh, yes! In danger I found the splendor there Oh, yeah Dancin' atop flamin' pit Dancin', we're creating it We're dancin' right on the lip Of a volcano Volcano A volcano Thrown in the dance with the mystics It's burnin' us up with his music It's sensualistic It's ritual It's polytheistic Ye-heh-heh. Whoa. Oh, smokestack lightning Shinin' just like gold Oh, don't you hear me cryin' A-whoo-hoo A-whoo-hoo A-whoo-hoo Oh, stop your tryin' Let a poor boy ride Oh, don't you hear me cryin' A-whoo-hoo A-whoo-hoo A-whoo-hoo A lot of these are from when I sang with Hubert. A lot of Howlin' Wolf Wang-Dang-Doodle and things of that nature. Oh, here's Blind Willie McTell and his wife. Apparently he shot his wife. He only winged her. But from what they say, it may be apocryphal, but they say that he stood in the middle of the room and just, like, swung around rapid firing... like a ballet dancer. What's this one? I don't know. This is... It says it's Buster's big book, so... let's see. Explain to me your lyric book. It's not just lyrics in there. There's something else in there. What's in that book that I used for the show? Uh-huh. There's a lot of, like, devotional art in there. There's millions of Hindu gods, you know. You ever go to, like, Central Park and there'll be a lot of, like, Cuban guys and Puerto-Ricans and they're all playing congas and things like that. Do they still have that there? Yeah. You know those guys that are into, like, the Orishas? So, like, say you and me are playing. 'Cause you know, the rumbas all have, you know, like... saints that each beat is dedicated to or whatever. So they kind of just, like, beam it up and then it comes back down to you. It's not like we're playing, like, at each other. So when you'll turn a page, there'll be a different image there that's associated somehow with that song. It could be associated with that song. It's just something that reminds me of what I'm there for, you know. Because it makes it a lot more fun for me, you know. Music to me is, you know, they say playing music, you know. They don't say like working music. You're supposed to be playing. So... If I don't do it as some kind of a devotional thing, it's gonna become a grind for me. You're in the Mansion Of Fun with Sri Rama, Poindexter, Johansen. Where... aestheticism and eroticism... are two sides of the same coin. And unwillingness to see this exacts a terrible price in prudery, misery and warped lives. I'm just a bad boy La la la la la la la la la la la la La la la la la la la la la la la All dressed up in fancy clothes I'm taking the trouble To blow my bubble Away Bad boy La la la la la la la la la la la la La la la la la la la la la la la Life is just a bowl of cherries I'm taking the trouble To turn my night into day You, were in the vanguard of punk, new wave, with the New York Dolls. Legendary group. Now, what made you completely abandon that kind of rock and roll that you were doing? I understand in Cleveland you just decided that you had enough of it. Well, I'll tell you. Contrary to popular belief, you know, because the Dolls were such, like, a shock kind of troop battalion that... I think a lot of people didn't realize that the Dolls music was... built like basically, you know, the roots of the thing was really rhythm and blues. And it was, like, a classic rock and roll band. What makes a classic rock and roll band? Big Fat Mamas Are Back In Style. And... uh Lavender Coffin? Lavender... All I want is a lavender coffin and what I call pre-haze cold rock and roll. How did Buster Poindexter become? Well, basically, after the Dolls, you know I did the David Johansen show for many years. I was on the road for like 250 nights a year. And I had a lot of fun. But after a while, you know, you want to come back home you want to kind of establish relationships and things like that. So I came up with this brilliant idea to come up with an act that could only play in New York. There was a club in my neighborhood called Tramps and I thought I was gonna do four Mondays there because, it was a Blues bar but they didn't have acts on Mondays. And so I thought I'd do, well, since there's nobody there on Monday, I'd try this little cabaret thing with, like, three guys as a backup band. And I started doing it and it caught on and all of a sudden I was making my nut, so to speak. And I wasn't going on the road. I wanted to do a show that would entertain my peers, so to speak. Now your peers, you're what, 36 now, about? I'm 37. - Thirty-seven now. - For a few more minutes. Really inching up there. - "Inching up there," to where? - Well, I don't know. - To the end. - The next thing you'll be 40. - This is the big one. - Right. OK, there's two Yiddish hipsters. It's a short joke. Two Yiddish hipsters sitting on a park bench and one of them says "Oy." And the other one says, "I'm hip." OK? Do you ever write down, not jokes, but, like, banter and things you wanna say? Banter? Like things you wanna say between songs that aren't jokes? You mean that aren't funny? - Yeah. - No. No. I mean, you know, if I'm playing in, like, a big place, I'm not, like, telling jokes because... The David Johansen band went on this whole tour with Pat Benatar and you know, she's great. She can really belt out a tune. But... they would kinda look at me like I was a bug a lot of the times in those... hockey rinks, you know? Like you were a little guy or like you were a freak or... Like a bug. And what kind of songs can Buster sing that you can't sing? Uh... Everything. I mean, you know, I can sing, you know, a lot of kinds of songs, but... I think I already went through this with you. Like, Buster is just like, I can do anything I want. People aren't... expecting something else. They come because it's unexpected, what I'm gonna do, you know? And they kind of trust that it's gonna be good and it's always good. What can I say? I woke up late one day And turned on my TV They said they'd take it all When I was asleep Well they were bringing down doors They were purging and burning People just like me Well I fixed a drink, I switched around the channel But that was all I could see Well it's such a boring feeling When you find that you're fallin' to a Totalitarian state Well, I know what's left It don't seem right You just don't feel so great Well it seems we're all camping And the Mexicans was laughing Down at the detention center They didn't seem to care that they were there I couldn't find one dissenter I didn't feel communal I was incommunicado I couldn't see it getting any better I couldn't call no one I wish I had a gun I couldn't even send a letter It's such a boring feeling When you find that you're falling To a totalitarian state I know what's left It don't seem right You just don't feel so great When they came to get me I'd hope they would forgive me I tried playing dead I finished my drink, assessed the situation Put the covers up over my head I quit Well, me and my friends All hang out in a non-litigious crowd We're sensitive to other people's needs And on this we are proud But this situation really bites I mean, for crying out loud I don't know what to do I feel like a fool This time I'm gonna sue It's such a boring feeling When you find that you're fallin' to a Totalitarian state You know what's left It don't seem right It just don't seem so great Oh! Whoa. Whoa. Hey, hey. Hey, hey. Totalitarian State... Baby! It sounds like you've never really been bitter about the fact that the Dolls never garnered these huge wages, whereas you could look at bands like Kiss and Aerosmith and they made a pretty good dime off - Yeah. - essentially a watered-down version of what you were doing. Yeah, no. We, we were a band's band, you know? In a lot of ways. And we influenced a lot of bands and a lot of kids were influenced by us who started bands, you know. Take the Ramones. The Ramones saw us and they, they looked at each other and said, "Hey, if these guys can do that, we can do that." And to have influence like that on people, I think, is really good, you know. To give people the... the idea like, "Hey, I could do that." Wow, listen to how sweet that is. Didn't I make you feel - Like you were the only man - Whoo! That's probably Aretha playing piano. - Didn't I give you everything -You know that? That a woman possibly can - Is this her sister? - Yeah. But with all the love I give ya It's never enough But I'm gonna show ya, baby That a woman can be tough Is there any music you just don't like? Most, most stuff on the radio. I don't even know what I don't like, because I just don't hear it. You know? It doesn't, if I like something it stops in the middle of my head and it just rattles around and if I don't like it it just kind of goes through me and I don't grab it. You know, my show is not like something that... your average kid would understand. Why not? Why not? Because it's, it's out of the ordinary, you know, it's kind of like... it's got, it's like peculiar to my taste, you know. That Marilyn Horne version, she gets right to the meat. Did the folks play that stuff? - How'd you get turned on to... - Oh, you know, my old man, he was an opera singer. And it's like, all that we heard had been classical music when I was a kid, - Oh. - which used to drive me crazy. - Mm-hmm. - My old man would be like wearing his army clothes, paint in the house and the Texaco Opera on the Grundig would be in the window, blaring out. And my friends would come by, on Saturday and I'd be like holding the ladder and I'd be like... My old man would be up there like And now... and now it's all over your radio show. This next song, I wrote it to a Lightnin' Hopkins song. Texas Blues. I gave the lyrics to Brian, see what he wanted to do with it. And he came up with this really great song and we're gonna sing it for you now. So the only one who sounds like Lightnin' Hopkins in this version is me. I give you that Eddie Murphy smile, like... I keep watching and wondering Why a little bird flies up to the sky Only God knows, maybe he don't You know that holy talk has been a lie I keep praying it's the truth And I ain't got no death to die I ain't got no death to die Yeah, I keep hollering and prayin' I don't have to be such a hurtful bum How could I sometimes be so good And turn around and be so wrong to some Ah, what's the use of all this praying When I don't know the spirit from The spirit from who this prayer have come That old eternal spirit Always whispering in my ear Radiance of the infinite Seems to be everywhere But my weary eyes can't see And I'm afraid my old ears cannot hear Afraid my old ears cannot hear You've been a consolation of my life And you will be of my death And I pray that you'll have mercy Moment of my last breath I know these words of weariness Just don't make me wander from death to death Don't make me wander from death to death Beautiful. Now, our next guest is truly a unique rock star. I mean he's what you call a free spirit, a knockout singer, starting a heat wave right here at the Waldorf-Astoria singing Hot Hot Hot, Buster Poindexter! One, two, three! Ole-Ole-Ole-Ole Ole-Ole-Ole-Ole That was like, the bane of my existence, that song, you know. I don't know how I feel about it now. I haven't heard it lately. Would you hear it like all over the place like... Oh, God, that's ubiquitous, that song. It was like, forget about it. It's like, you know, they play it at weddings, bar mitzvahs. It's like... Six Flags. Six Flags! Hot hot hot Hot hot hot Hot hot hot They used to have a show on VH1 called One Hit Wonders. And I was on it twice because I sang, you know, like that Animals medley thing as David Johansen. And then I sang Hot Hot Hot as Buster, so I was a one hit wonder twice. Did you have like a vision for what your life would be like at this point? You can make plans and they're fun to do, but they're rarely... What you want to do by the time you get there. I think I used to be like... five year increments. Where I'll be in five years or whatever, when I was a kid. Yeah. Somebody said that some guy who was a record producer, he was a... he was a millionaire. And I thought, "Wow, a millionaire." He was 23, you know? And I was like, "Wow, a millionaire at 23. That'd be great." But I didn't... I came to realize, well, that's not really so good. Because the guy, turned out, he was a murderer. - Do I want to do like this? - Yeah. Yeah. I like this. Get the oil off your chest. Just because I'm not like responding, doesn't mean I'm not in ecstasy. I know that. We're married. Here you go. So what were you saying Mommy about what we wanna make sure we get in this? You spend a lot of time putting on a show, while you're keeping hidden not just your interior life, but a lot of other aspects of your life, right? - And... - Yeah. You guys see the pants? I can see the, the pants are yellow. - That's good. - But I can't see like the whole style of the pants. That's OK. You wanna see what you look like? I wanna see what you're gonna shoot. It's best to leave an incomplete... - Yeah. - picture of yourself. Can we have the, uh, like can we have the coquettes showing on the book? I was gonna have David look at that book, actually. Oh! I mean let's face it. We've been very happy together. We're very happy and Leah is very happy. That's like really good because... occasionally we have to deal with like, you know, I don't wanna use the word crisis. But you know, whatever. - Something that's... - We've had some crises. Yeah. As we get older, we accumulate ghosts. 'Cause, you know, there's a lot more dead people than there are the living. I've lived through like, Vietnam War, the AIDS epidemic... and so many things, you know? And had people who I love that have died from COVID very recently, you know. Put your sweet lips A little closer to mine You know, there's Hal Wilner, for example. Given that you lost someone in your band at 21, was an early death something that you yourself feared... - when this... - No. No. I never learned my lesson. You know, after I was in the original Dolls, the ones that there was a lot of you know, catastrophic stuff. I had a band called David Johansen Band I made for... We got in a van and went back and forth, across this country about, I don't know, nine times, opening for heavy mental acts at hockey rinks. Oh my God. When I think of that... It killed me. It actually killed me. These guys, they called magazines, books. OK. So, what are you readin' there, pal? Viva. My book. I said, that's not a book. That's a Viva Magazine. You know what I'm saying? Thank God they had, they'd come out with Walkmans by then, you know. And of course gin, you know, which they always had. A one, two, three, four...

Let's just dance Come on, let's just dance I can't get the kind of love that I want And I need So, let's Just Dance Oh, hi... You know, when I was a... a kid, I was probably like, not a kid. I was probably like almost 30-years-old or something. Maybe I acted like a kid. I... went to... see Milos Forman to audition for a... a part of one of the two, like lead guys in Hair. In the movie Hair. You know, I figured, an actor, what is that? So, I think I have all the prerequisites, completely irresponsible, drunk a lot. Hey, I can go on and on. But... I fit the bill. So I went to see Milos and... I didn't even do the audition. I mean, we got along like a house on fire. I mean, "Oh God, David. David, I love you." And we were drinking schnapps and we were smacking each other on of back and we were having a gay old time, OK? Oh my God, it was so great. So then he calls Twyla Tharp and he says, "I got, I got the guy. This is the guy. I'm gonna send him over. You see if he can dance." In order to get this part, the... one of the major parts that you had to pass. Milos, Twyla... and Galt MacDermot, who wrote the music. So I went over to Twyla Tharp's. I was... dancing... like Nijinsky. I mean, I was like... like a gazelle. Back and forth with the whole troop back and forth, like throwing flowers. I mean imaginary flowers, but still. Twyla calls up Milos, "He's, he's great. He's a natural. He's great." I'm thinking, you know, "Hollywood, here I come." I'm like picking out real estate, you know what I'm saying? Next day I go to see Galt McDermott. It's up on one of those Broadway rehearsal rooms, you know, at the piano and everybody's standing around. He's got the piano and I come in and I decide to sing the song Hair. I figured, you know, I hadn't really prepared. You know and... but Galt McDermott stood up. He shut the... the... the lid of the keyboard and he said, "This guy can't sing!" I was like, "Wait a minute, wait a minute. I don't, I don't act. I don't dance, but I'm a singer. You know, I, that's what I do. I'm a singer." I didn't get the part anyway. My dreams were crushed. But I only had those dreams for three days. So it wasn't like a lifetime. You know, years later... I saw... Galt McDermott at an awards ceremony. We were both getting a medal for something and... he was in his dotage. And... we shook hands and the whole thing. He didn't remember me from, from that day. But, I didn't remind him I didn't mention it. You know, I didn't mention it. I'm not that kind of guy. This is nice. It's a maimed happiness I keep trying to acquiesce It's like a tempestuous child You play with and humor to keep Quiet as you possibly can 'Til finally it goes to sleep Life takes a lot of finesse It's a maimed happiness I keep myself to every way Both refined and uncouth Then maybe once in a while I can be with the truth Don't know If there's that much to be said I thought this world and all the time That we spend Still I think I want to live This crazy life over again Yeah, I've been to the doctor He said there ain't much he can do Said you got the human condition Boy, I feel sorry for you There's a sorrowful joy I know it since I was a boy Joyful sorrow, I guess It's a maimed happiness Beautiful! You guys have been great. Thank you. Thank you. My friends. Maimed Happiness. I feel like that could be your thesis for the show. Yeah. Mara, what's that... Those two brothers, they were writers, but one was a philosopher. Henry James and William James? Who wrote that book? Well, Henry James was the novelist. Right. So it was William James was the philosopher. - Right. - Yeah. I was reading that William James Variety of Spiritual Experiences, I guess it's called. At one point he used the expression "maimed happiness." "It's kind of like a maimed happiness," whatever he said. And it just stuck in my mind, you know. It's just, existence is... maimed happiness. Happy birthday, man. - Freddy. - A lot more energy tonight. Yeah, I slept like 10 hours last night. You are not today who you were when you were 17. So... - you were this innocent... - Hmm... Listen, sorry. You were spinning around on the parking meter in front of Gem Spa. I was spinning around on the other parking meter. It's the Mansion of Fun show where we do our thing and we don't worry about the outcome, because we recognize sorrow as of the essence. Because when there's time, there's sorrow and we can't rid the world of sorrow, but we can choose to live in joy. Look how beautiful. Hi, baby. Long time no see. Like when was the first time you felt like your sadness kind of connected you to the world? Oh. Yeah, in 3D. Oh, man. Then the ostrich comes out. People think I'm so young, right? And I'm sure people say that to you, "You're so young." 'Cause it took us so long to grow up. Like we hit every crack. We had to be... we fulfilled the premise of becoming. - That's right. - We fulfilled it. - What's the rush? - What's the rush? There's a lot of different things that you can hear or see, you know, people overcoming obstacles. Surviving. Come on! Wow!
