I said no. Get lost! Tonight is a big show. Don't messed it up. All waiters must be available all around. Don't let our guests waiting. Steps, wealth, encounter, death.

What do you want? - Eleanor! Eleanor! - How much? Just give me few more days, okay? I will give you your money. Take it. Here, take it. Tell her how much you owe me, my friend? No! No! No! 500? I have 500. I'll give you 500. Here you go. Not 500. It's 5000 euros. What? Hey, listen... Listen... Listen. I'll give you all of your money, all of them. Just give me more time, okay? I promise you. Shut up! No, no, no, wait! Wait, wait, wait. It's okay. It's okay, everybody. Eleanor... - Take it, take it. - No, Eleanor. - No, Eleanor. - Take it and leave us. - Take it and leave us now. - No!

Para La Pregunta Sobre La Ofensa De Asesinato De Robbery" Hey, it's him! Stop! Hey! Don't move! Don't move! Just stay there! Hey, stop! Go get him! Don't move! Thank you. Here comes the famous guy. Here's your money. Goodbye, my love. I love you, baby. Screw you, guys. -It hurts. -Sorry. Don't be a crybaby. I know I'm a bit out of line. It's for the show anyway, to be more convincing. Why don't you understand about that? You did a good job, man. - Seriously. - I know. Bye-bye, Eleanor. - You are the best, man. - I know. Lorenzo won't hired us? He said we're just bunch of rookies. What is it? Look at this. He should've seen this. Yeah, it's our future. We need to make this as our number one priority. Yeah, right. It's always about this priority. So this is the new target, right? Yes, it is our next target. God is fair and just. - I totally agree. I second that. - God is so fair and just. God give you a chance with you having that prettier face than us. Just use it then. Go get them! There's a package for you, Miss Alana. Thank you, Mr Abdi. "Accompany me tomorrow night, wear that dress I sent for this event." "Hello!" You know what, guys? No one is born successful. Everyone needs to strive for success. And I'm going to prove it to you. You both can choose between Rolls-Royce or Lamborghini. I'll buy it. Sa... - What is it? - He's right here. Why are you looking that way? I'm about to say it now. Sa... You should've change your name. Not Mahesa. Then, what's his name should be? It's supposed to be... ...Mahalu. Because you're always having hallucinations. Halu. What's wrong with that? - Halu! - Well, yeah. Why can't I fantasize? Fantasy is a dream. And a dream will attract all positive energies to motivate you, then your dream will come true. Okay. I'll choose Rolls-Royce, then. You want Rolls-Royce? Then, try to flirt with that girl over there. That's a walk in the park. Don't call me Dastan if I can't have her. Even with this kind of face, I'll show you that I'll have that girl. - Go ahead, then. - Okay. Record it now. - Hello, beautiful. - Hello. - What's your name? - It's Lucy. Lucy? Perfect. My name is Dastan. Can we make out now? Mr Abdi. So you're happy here, right? Yeah. - Hello, boys. - Hey, what's up? - What's up? Good? Good. - Good. You? How's the party? I'm gonna see some people there... Babe, I'll go first, okay? Anyway, guys, I have a party in five days. You guys should come, okay? - Bring some people and stuff. - Mr Danu? And you know, maybe bring some more... She looks like a nice prospect, am I right, huh? - Hello, Adriana, how are you? - Hello, I'm good. - How's your life going? - It's all good. How about you? Hello, one Cosmopolitan, please? Let me. No, no. Thanks. Please. Let me. - Two, please. Yeah. - Two? Thank you. It's my pleasure to treat you. It'll be 20 euros. I'll pay for it, then. Thank you. Sorry, I lost my wallet. So, here's to this moment and our future. Pretty. Bara. My name is Bara. Are you here on vacation? Where are you from? Indonesia. Oh, my God. I never thought that you're from Indonesia. Thanks for your compliment earlier when you told me that I'm pretty. Yeah. You have a nice watch there. You must be living a fancy life. Not really. I mean, a classy girl like you... What class? A high class. Just look at your necklace, earrings, bag, and your watch there. Are you a photographer? Why? Are you curious about me? It's just a hobby. This camera helps me to create history. With this camera, I can choose which moment that I consider precious. Then, I'd capture that moment... ... so it could be a history for me to keep forever. - Wow. - Yeah. And one more thing. This camera teaches me to focus on my target. What do you mean? You see this? Life needs to be like this camera. Focus on one goal. What if you fail, then? We can always find another target. Easy, right? Just like in life. If you fail on one target, you need to find another target to focus on immediately. I'm yours. Huh? What? This one here, "I'm yours". Who is this? He's the one who helped me find my earring back in the restaurant. Bara. Thanks. But she's my girlfriend. You shouldn't let him get close to you. I'm just trying to be nice to him because he helped me before. I know. That's fine. But... ... based from his appearance, he's not on the same level to talk to you. He definitely couldn't afford to live like us here in Barcelona. He must be a pickpocket or a con artist. - Danu, that's enough. - That's why we need to be careful. Just look at that camera, that must be one of his loots. Danu, that's enough. Fine. - Here's your order. - Thank you. Here, do you want some? Thank you. One more thing, you look prettier yesterday. Chill, bro. I bought this camera when I won a lottery. It still have it's guarantee card. - Are you an Indonesian? - And what if I am? Still want to mock me? Sorry. But he doesn't mean it. I'm okay. What? That's okay. Okay. I'll go, then. Sure. Who was that? And yesterday? What was that mean? Hey, Miss. You look tired. May I help you? - No, thank you. - It's fine. Let me help you. Okay, the guests upstairs. Pasta for the boy, and this Spanish tortilla for the girl. - Thank you. - Thank you. Can you hold this for me, please? Thank you. I think we started off on the wrong foot. - You work here? - Enjoy your meal. May I have the cutlery? - Thanks. - Yeah. "Are you sure you want this guy as your boyfriend?" - Is it good? - Yeah. What else do you want? You want to check our orders? To think that our first encounter wasnâ€™t that nice, I guess I'll make it up to you, guys. Let me pay the bill. I don't need your money. If you said so, bro. Does he have a problem or something, huh? You can mock me all you want, but everything has a price, bro. Honey, I'll pay you back later. Mr Abdi, have you seen my wallet? I already gave it to you. All right. Who is it? I don't know either. It's the second time today. The second time? Let me see. Hello! - Yeah, who is this? - May I speak to Miss Alana? It's for you. Hello, who's speaking? And where did you get my number from? Why? Does your boyfriend who sit next to you got panic every time someone hit on you? Yeah, I will take it later. Thank you. Well, who was it? It's from the jewelry shop, due to my broken earrings. - Hello. One cappuccino, please. - Okay. - Yes. - Thank you. Thank you. Alana? May I... What are you doing sitting here? Because I don't like sitting here alone. I don't think I already told you my name. How do you know my name? Just consider it as one of my abilities. And you must be curious how can I also got your number, right? Are you stalking me? You come here every day? At this time? You know what? I'm so lucky to meet you here alone. Where's your rich boyfriend? Anyway, this is our third meeting. What a coincidence. Let me get this straight. I consider the first and the second time as a coincidence. But this time, I'm really sure that you stalked me. You don't need to do that. You could just ask anything you want to know about me now. Okay. I just confused with your possessive boyfriend. Does he really like that? I think that your relationship is never tied based on love. Well, it's none of my business. I don't care at all about your relationship with that guy. But from what I saw, when you're at that restaurant, just yourself, and when at the beach with that guy, completely different. Is that guy your bodyguard? Isn't it scary, guarded by him all the time? - Mr Abdi? He looks scary to you? - Yeah. Well, more or less, yeah. Mr Abdi is a bodyguard and Danu's father right-hand man. But all I know is his wife already passed away long time ago, and he has a daughter who is being taken care by Danu's father. Danu's father is a kind and a very caring person. Yeah, he's really different from his son. Danu always consider Mr Abdi like a CCTV for me. - Huh? Like a CCTV? - Yes. - Have you pay all of your debt? - What? Why are you laughing? I thought they're debt collector who's going to beat yourself again. Worry about me? Why are you always look depressed? Okay, don't answer that, I don't need it. I only need a chance to make you happy. Because you need a little dose of happiness. Having fun with Bara. Having fun? I always have fun. FYI, smiling doesn't always mean you're happy. You could just probably hiding your broken heart, or God intentionally unite you with a wrong person first, and then the right one, just so you know how to be grateful. You know why I said that? Because I am the only one who can take care of you. Oh, yeah? You could see that I'm the one who's sitting here next to you now. Come with me. Why should I come with you? First, because you're going to have fun with me. Second, because I will take care of you. And third, because I'm not a stiff guy who's being possessive with you. Why are you doing this to me? I hate you. You stupid! Let's go! Let's go! - Let's go! - Yep. So, when will you marry him? What? I could see it from your possessive boyfriend... ... that you're going to be his wife. But I could see that it's the opposite with you. You seems so fed up with him. I'll be more fed up if you keep talking about that. Come on, let's go. Let's go. What is it, Miss Alana? You can go home first, Mr Abdi. But Danu asked me to... It's fine, you can go home first. - What is it? - I think we should not be here. Why is that? Hey, you think I don't have enough cash? I'm just not in a mood for shopping. Come on, we're having fun. I promise you. Yeah? Let's go! I'm so tired that I could pass out. Please, don't. You're so heavy, I can't carry you. - That's enough. Please! - Okay. Come on. Let's sit. Come here. Just stay here and don't move, okay? Where are you going? Just stay here and don't move! - Okay. - Stay. Hello, Alana. I'm on my way to get some ice cream for you. Here's the ice cream shop. Which flavour do you want? Mint or strawberry? What are you doing here? - Shopping. - Shopping? Why didn't you tell me? Where's Mr Abdi? I told him to go home. Okay, let's go home now. What's wrong with you? Nothing. I'm fine! Then why aren't you moving? Is it because your shoelace is undone? Is that it? Here, let me help you. Ice cream in a hot day feels like... ... hell. I mean, heaven. What a small world, right? We meet again. It's a hot day, huh? That's why I bought two of these. Right, forgive my manners. Do you want some? Okay. I guess, I'll just go then. Now you can move. Let's go home. I already told you not to let Alana go alone, Mr Abdi! Don't let this happen again. Is that clear? It's not Mr Abdi's fault. It's my fault. Baby, I've told you before, don't you ever go anywhere alone. If I were not there, that jerk would already harassed you. Okay? You're not a little girl anymore, right? I don't need to tell you every time, right? Thanks for today. You are actually the greatest thing that ever happened to me. And I won't stop there, I want us to last. Is it possible for me to look forward to the future with you? "39.6" Mr Abdi will drive you to the doctor. There's no need to do that. I just need some rest. I already took my medicine. - I'm sorry I can't be with you today. - It's okay. You should rest. I'll come by later, okay? -No! -Why? You'll get sick too. What's that smell? Just go to sleep. What smell's that? Did you smell it? I have a runny nose. Did you smell that? Smells like onion. Is it you? Okay. Okay. Just call me if you need anything, okay? See you. Get well soon, okay? Why did you turn it off? So I could use low battery reason when someone's trying to reach me. You're getting good at lying now. Well, I learned from the best. Come here. I've been looking for her at the usual doctor, but she's not there. Just go find her! Wouldn't it be more convenient to wait for her call? Just do it! Don't say anything! How long have you lived here? It's been two years... ... since my parents took me here for college. When they went home, I dropped out from college. And started to pursue my passion... ... until my dad get angry because I didn't follow his instruction. If you're not going to college, then what are you doing here now? You'll laugh if I tell you about that. No, I would not. I promise you. I play music on the street before. I'm sorry. Please, go on. I played music on the street, then I met my two best friend, Dastan and Revan. The first was Dastan. Everybody! I played music and he was selling goods on the street. Then police came chasing us, we hid in the alley until Revan came along and helped us. - Thank you, my friend. - Thank you, my friend. - Where do you come from? - I'm from Indonesia. Indonesia? We're from Indonesia. Cut it out! He's also from Indonesia. - We're from Indonesia as well. - Thank you. Since then, we've become best friend and play music together on the street. I never thought that someone like you have so many abilities. I can do anything. Playing music, singing, and pickpocketing. - What? - I'm serious. But I only do that to one person. Right! Anyway, how can you know my name? Tell me. I'm not that stupid just to find out your name. I even know everything about you, Alana. That's Bara. Maybe your lies are also one of your abilities. That's Bara. You don't know that Alana have a beautiful meaning in English? Really? Alana is like a fair maiden. It's a beautiful princess character, just like Snow White. - That's what Alana is. - Now I truly amazed by you. Even though I don't even know is that the truth or not. I'm serious. I'm telling the truth... ... this time. This time? How long have you not laugh like that? Are you always be a smart ass like this? No, I'm not a smart ass. I just think that you're prettier now. If you are not happy, then why can't you just left him? Actually, me and Danu... I met Danu back at my college years here. He's different from then and now. He always taking care and being nice to me in the past. He really was a very nice guy. Hey. Let me help you. Over there? Come on. After you, please. Yeah, sure. - Let me pay. - Oh, no. Look... Hey, let me pay. But as the time goes by... ... he changed. I never thought that he changed that fast. I know every people will change at one point. Or perhaps he's not changing at all, but probably I finally can see the true form of him. He isn't more than just a spoiled brat who spend his dad's fortune. But... ... now I get so used to him. He's already do so much thing for me. He even told Mr Abdi to always guarding and following me. I think... ... every person has two sides. The first one is that they need to please others. And the second one is that they need to be themselves. And I personally choose the second one. I choose to follow my own passion. I listen to my heart. That's what I'm fighting for. My heart. Then which one is worse? Your life or mine? Probably both. Or probably it's just came from our own mind. But I'm sure from now on, it won't get worse. Because I... ... have already met you. Sorry, I accidentally bite you. - Do you want some? - No! Yes, sir. I've found Miss Alana. No need to lie, baby. I already know about that. Mr Abdi saw you at the beach today. But don't you forget... ... that you have to tell me every time you want to go. Have you forget about that? Who are you with today? Mr Abdi, who accompanied Alana today? Mr Abdi! There's a lot of people there. I only focused on Miss Alana. Next time, you have to ask my permission first. And Mr Abdi have to be next to you all the time. Okay? Am I falling in love? Why haven't I felt this before? Why is he so different than Danu? It all feels real with him. I knew it from the start that your emotion would ruin everything. I think we've had enough. I can't do this no more. - Oh, my God. - Come on, Sa. You're going to stop make a living for our future just because of that girl? That's the stupidest thing that I've ever heard. What do you mean? This is our dream, Sa. Do you want to sacrifice our dream or just stop there? Just because of a girl you've just met and you know nothing about. - It isn't worth it, man. - What do you know about Alana? Why did you say that she's not worth it? I never said I'd sacrifice our dream. I just said that we have to focus by finding other ways. You both know that I've never want to utilize those girls from the start. You both are the one who forced me to do it. Well, it's because of you have prettier, cooler, and more handsome face than ours. If I have your look, I'll be doing that myself. Do you remember what you've said? No one is born successful. Everyone needs to strive for success. Well, look at you now. You couldn't even prove your own words. None of it, Sa! Honestly, I'm so disappointed. I'm so disappointed. You'd better choose now. You'd better choose between our dream or that unknown girl. Choose, Sa. Choose, Sa! Take back everything that you've said about Alana. And when I said I'm done, I'm done. You're a coward! Hey! That's enough! - That's enough! - You are my best friend. We struggle together! But that doesn't mean that you could interfere with my heart! Now, answer me! Who's the most coward between us? You who always utilizing girls, or me who struggle with my own way? I'm disappointed with both of you. By doubting ourselves... ... and thinking that utilizing Alana is our only way for our band to succeed. I'm disappointed with both of you. What is it? What's wrong? You're not a good liar. Unlike you? May I kiss you? Why would you ask? You're so funny. Because I won't kiss you without your permission. What is it? You want the real one? You're so mean! Come here! I never fell in love. I only dream about one fine day in my life. One fine day. And then you came along. My life was so boring, with all of those rules that killed my feelings, but with your presence, makes me so confuse. How come you came and changed my life? I've never felt love like this besides from my parents. I see forever when I first saw you. If I told you that I feel the same, can I hold you forever, Alana? Hey, David. Hey, Benny. What's up, man? You seems well known here. Hey, Bara. Welcome. Come up on stage and sing a song with us. Yeah. Come on. Bravo! How about if we ask Bara to sing his new song? This song is for my lover, Alana! - Alana, now you finally saw me as... - A liar! What do you mean? Hey, you! I already called the police. Good luck. Alana. - I can explain everything... - I've just realize... ... that lying is already becoming part of your life. Alana, I can explain everything. You're no different than Danu. Alana. You're no more than just a liar! You're not approaching me because you like or interest in me. But because you have your own agenda. You did it! Great job! You should be proud to yourself! Everything you said to me, that's just a mere lie! You even lied about your name! Am I right, Mahesa? It's not just you who knows about everything. The different is, I'd never lie to you. Alana, I know I was wrong. But I can explain everything. Maybe this is the first time for you to fight for something, choosing what your heart wants. I ask you to never stop believing in your heart. This is what you are fighting for! I've never stopped believing in my heart. I've never stopped fighting for what my heart wants. I only stop believe in you, and I stop... ... fighting for the wrong person. Alana! Alana! Wait! Alana! Alana! Sir? Sir? Mr Abdi! Mr Abdi, stop, please. Is everything all right, Miss? - Hello, Andrea. - Hello, how are you? - How about you? - I'm fine, thank you. - Can I have the usual, please? - Sure, I'll prepare it now. Where's Alana, Mr Abdi? Mr Abdi, answer me, please. Sir? Stop bothering Miss Alana. Even when having her favourite coffee, he sets some rules for her. Thank you. Mr Abdi? I'm begging you, Mr Abdi. You're my only hope. Just tell me when and where I can meet Alana, sir! Please, sir! I won't budge until you help me! You can't dismiss me. I'll always fight for her! Because I know that Alana is falling in love with me, sir. If Miss Alana really likes you, why would she told me yesterday to stop, and then she slapped you? That's because you broke her heart. Do you understand that? - Now, move! - I only need one chance, Ar. I can't possibly hurt her! I love her! If you think that I lie, you can slap me. Go ahead! But I just need one chance to make it up to her. Please, sir. Move! What's wrong with you, huh? Come on, be happy. Babe, you're drunk. I'm never drunk. - Come on. Come on. - No. Am I drunk? It's still five drinks. No, you... Tell Danu that you never love him! What are you doing here? Tell him, Alana! Get lost! Alana never love you! She only loves me. Who do you think you are? You come here and talks about love. What love? Baby, tell him... ... that you would never fell for a loser like him. Come on, say it. Come on. I'll take that as a yes. You see? She's mine! So you could stop dreaming! Loser! Get out of here! Tell him, Alana! You know what? Guys, look! This one Indonesian guy, he thinks he can just walk in here... ... and steal my girlfriend! My girlfriend! You guys think he can? No! Why? Because he's a loser! - Loser! - Loser. Get out of here! Alana never loves you and you know it. And you know what? I'm more capable giving her happiness that she never got from you. You see, Alana? That's how much I love you, Alana. I came here to hear the truth from your own mouth. If you really love me, not fell for a guy who only loves his supremacy to you. Are you done? Good. I won't leave until you say you love me, Alana. Come and fight me! Come on! Go ahead and hit me. What's wrong, huh? Come on! You need her? Come here! I think he needs your help. And you know, right? I like to fight fair. So, can you help him? Huh? Go on! Help him, huh? You never know what happened between me and Alana. I love you, Alana! You see it now, how much I love you, Alana! Shut up! You know that you have one mistake, you mess with my girlfriend! And I won't let anyone get close to her! You said you love her? You know what? I have a good idea. From this moment, you can no longer say it. But don't worry, I'm going to make it really fast. I love you, Alana. Danu, stop it! Alana, I love you. - Danu! - I love you, Alana. - Enough! - I love you. I'm still... I love you. Shut up! Shut up! Whoa! Open the trunk, Mr Abdi! Finish this! Mahesa... Mr Abdi, don't! Stop, Mr Abdi! I love you. Mr Abdi, don't! That's a nice one. What's wrong? You want to hit me again? Huh? Go on. But you know this, right? No matter how much you hit me, you're still mine, right? You... ... are not going to make me afraid of you anymore! I'm not the old Alana. I just feel sorry for you. Because you are so pathetic. You are so desperate to feel the real love, even you have to force anything that will never be yours. And one thing, I would never fell for a loser. A loser like you! Are you done? This is me, okay? Tomorrow you'd forget everything. And you're still going to love me. And you know why, right? Go away! Why? Look! He can't even say I love you anymore. He can't even say his own name! So please be a nice girlfriend. Enjoy the pride with me. Now I'm definitely sure... ... that I'll never be yours. All of that will never happen, baby. Well, we'll see. Come here. and now we'll see. You got it? Mahesa was right! I never fell in love with you! I don't care. You know why I don't care about that? Because you'll forever be mine! Because everything in this world has a price! Including you! You are right. Everything in this world has a price. Except you. Where's your pride? You hurt someone just because you are afraid... ... that one of yours going to be taken away from you! And I know why you're afraid. Because you realize it from the start... ... that I... ... never love you. You know what the most hurtful thing for me? The way you look at him. You never look at me the same. Why? You're wrong, Danu. You know nothing about Mahesa. Hello, Mom. I'm sorry for the late notice. I hope you understand, Mom, that music is my everything. And I'm sorry... ... that I let Dad down. I need to pursue my passion. I dropped out from college trying to make Dad understand. For him to let me choose my own path. But I was wrong, Mom. And now, I need to move forward, even without Dad. I'm sorry to let you down, Mom. And one thing, Mom. I want to tell you this, from all of my mistakes, there's one right. I fell in love. It's the most unexpected thing in my life. I really fell in love, Mom. And I will fight for it. And I won't look away from it. Her name's Alana. And I want to live another thousand years to love Alana. Which flavour do you want? If you choose mint, it means you like me. If it's strawberry, it also means you like me. Well, mint or strawberry is fine. I also have a present for you. You would look very pretty wearing this earrings. Unlike those cheap dress on the beach that day. It's really does not reflect you. Alana? Alana? "Are you sure you want this guy as your boyfriend?" Mr Abdi! Go find Alana immediately. Now!! Come on, move it! What are you doing, Mr Abdi? Hurry! Mr Abdi! What are you doing, Mr Abdi? I'm so sorry, Mr Danu. It seems I want to go back to Indonesia. Go home? What do you mean, sir? Miss Alana is gone. So there's no one that I should be taken care of. You know this, right? You know what you are doing, right? You think I would beg? No! So just go and find Alana right now! I... ... work... ... for your father, not for you. Excuse me. Take care of yourself, sir. You think I need you, sir? You're just my dad's slave! Damn it! Thanks to the spoiled guy who owns this wallet. Because of you, I can treat my loved one. Anyway, I'll give it back. Too bad, I spent it all! Now I'll already got my revenge. Fair enough, right? A happy ending for everyone. Except for an asshole like you. Good bye, my friend. Damn! Damn! Good morning. Are you Mr Danu Sanjaya? - Yes, I am. - Please, come with us. Let go of me! Let me go! Okay, okay. Thanks for today. You actually are the best thing that ever happen to me. But I just won't stop there. I want us to be together. Is it possible for me to looking forward to a future with you? - Hello, how are you? - Hello. I'm good, thank you. - One Americano, please. - Sure. Excuse me. May I sit here? Yes, please. Are you here by yourself? I saw you here before that's how I know that you're Indonesian. Are you okay? Is there something wrong? I saw you with a guy here before. Is he your boyfriend? Thank you. Sorry. Can I help you, perhaps? Dad? Dad? Please have a sit, Alana. What is it, Baby? Alana... Is this your dad? Yes, he is. Don't you know who he is? He's a murderer! He's the cold-blooded person... ... who helped Danu to get rid the guy that I love! Alana... He's not human. He's a heartless killing machine. Alana! Tell me where Mahesa is, Mr Abdi! You have to tell me, sir! Answer me, Mr Abdi! Tell me where Mahesa is! That's enough, Alana! Answer me, sir! Answer me, sir! Answer me, sir! Mr Abdi... Answer me, sir... Alana. What happened to him? I'm so sorry, sir. I'm so sorry, sir. Please forgive me, Mr Abdi. - Forgive me Mr Abdi. - That's okay, Miss. - I'm so sorry, sir. - That's okay. I'm so sorry... I'm so sorry... You are still alive! Mahesa... I thought you were... Since when you've got a tattoo of my name? How can you know it's your name? I know you lied about your name. Because I know what your Sanskrit tattoo means. It's "Mahesa", not "Bara". Before I lost you, I thought it's my bravery limit to tattooed your name on my arm. But I was wrong, Alana. I'm braver than that. I'd do anything... ... to have you. "Pak Sanjaya" Hello, sir. Where are you, Abdi? Go to the police station now! Danu got arrested. Yes, sir. - Take care of him and make sure he's okay. - Okay, sir. Danu's father just called me. Danu got arrested. He asked me to go there. There were four guys. Who are they? One of them is Danu, my ex-boyfriend. Don't worry, we'll help you. Anisa, come with me. Thank you. It still hurts. Mr Abdi! The one fine day of my life... ... is the first time we met. "One Fine Day"
