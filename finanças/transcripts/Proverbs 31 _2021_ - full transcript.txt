Who can find a virtuous woman for her price is far above all rubies. The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her so that he shall have no need of spoil. She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life. Blah, blah, blah! That's a load of bull crap. What woman in their right mind can honestly live up to these ridiculous standards? Certainly not this one. Look at these people. They're eating every word that he says. What the hell is wrong with them? We give you glory, we give you honor, we give you praise, lord God. We thank you for bringing us here one more time and letting us gather. Excuse you! I'm sorry. We have a special testimony today from our very own Brother Ant Pickens. Come on up, brother Ant. This overnight righteous wannabe idiot right here is my husband. At least he used to be. I don't know who he is now. Ma'am, you're not allowed to smoke in the sanctuary. I was just leaving. Jesus! I had a bad pass. I've robbed. I've stolen. I've used and abused drugs, but God has allowed me a second chance at life. And I'm forever grateful to be here today. Let's take it back to the beginning for a minute. Oh! Oh my gosh, I'm sorry. I must have left my purse in the car. Don't... Don't worry about it, Sweetheart. I got this. Oh thank you, Sir. Alright. Thanks! No problem. It's really kind of you. Can I get your signature, Sir? Yeah, that's fine. Thank you. Appreciate it, Bro. Thank you. Have a good day. Thank you. Let me get this for you. Oh, no. You've done enough. I got it. I got this. I just want you to see what you got to look forward to. Uh, what, stranger men buy me food? Of course not. I just want you to know that I can take care of you and be the man that you need. I don't know you and you definitely don't know me. Well, how about you give me a chance. My name is Anthony, but you can call me Ant. Yolanda, but everybody calls me Lonnie. So, what do I got to do to call you Lonnie instead of Yolonda? You're straight forward aren't you? I usually see something and I go for it. And I like what I see. Especially, with someone as beautiful as you are. So, tomorrow night? What about tomorrow night? You and I on a date. How about this? You told me a time in a place And if I decide to show up Then, you got yourself your date. Alright. You looked real nervous up there. Did you get what you came for? Better yet, is this little charade over yet? Is this why you came? Look, Babe, this is no charade. I'm a better man now. The old me is gone. So, I guess I'll never get my husband back. I'm right here, Babe. I'm a better man now. I'm trying to be the man that God intended for me to be. And the husband that you need me to be. What if you were already the husband I needed? I don't know who you are now. If I was that same man, we wouldn't even be having this conversation right now. Whatever. I love you, Woman. Love you too, Man. You better figure out what you want to do for dinner tonight because I'm not cooking. Don't worry about it. I'm not. I'm going to eat regardless. You remember this song? Of course. You proposed to me on this song. First time I ever saw you cry. One of the happiest moments of my life. I'm trying to give you a lifetime of memorable moments. I'm ready to be the husband you need and deserve. Well, I hope you're not doing this expecting me to be some sort of "Proverbs 31" type wife. Come on, Babe, just live in the moment We both deserve this. It's been too long. Okay. How about I take care of dinner and you tonight. Is that right? Keep talking. How about I give you a massage, run you some bubble bath, Then, go straight to dessert. Mmm... Yeah let's go straight to the dessert. Don't threaten me with a good time. Look, Babe, I know things has happened in the past. But my love for you would never change. Come show me how much you love me. Will do. Oh What the hell was that? What's you talking about? You with this weak messing given me. Pull my hair. Throw me against the wall. Hell talk nasty to me. Just be the man you used to be. Don't tell me god took that away from you too? Do not bring God into this. I was not just trying to have sex. I was trying to be deeper than that. Get out of here with that. It's been months without anything and when I decide to give you some, this is what I get. Uh-uh... No thank you. Lonnie? Where are you going? Out. I need to clear my mind. Babe! Don't wait up for me. Bye! Babe! How did we get to this point? Who is this man and what did he do to my husband? Working as a car salesman at this dealership was just a cover-up. This is where the real money comes from. At first watching ant fight was hard, but after seeing him knock people out over and over again, I got used to it. The fights barely lasted five minutes. Easy money! Yeah, he gambled a lot. That was his biggest flaw. Sometimes he'd lose. But he wins, he wins big. I'm talking no less than 50,000. He mostly wins on placing bets on games and fights. Ant has an eye for stuff like that. This... This was the day that he showed me how much he really loved me. Ready? Yeah. Surprise! Oh, is this... Is this ours? Paid in full. Everything is fully furnished. Go check out the house, Babe. Baby! Oh my God! Thank you. Oh look at this! look at this! Oh my God! This is so incredible! Oh my God! Wow! You like it? The kitchen! Are you kidding me! The counters! Baby this is amazing! Don't you want to check out the bedroom? Oh my God! Babe this house is so... Beautiful. Ever since you came into my life, I've never been more happy. And I want to spend the rest of my life making you as happy as you make me. Yolanda, will you marry me? What took you so long? For real? Of Course. Now give me my ring. I love it. I love you! Thank you! Oh my God! ♪ I'm the type of dude, Mommy, you can take a chance with. I'm real romantic without the Roman antics. ♪ ♪ Real romancing, we slow dancing. I could take around the world to beaches where white sand is. ♪ This man right here was everything to me. How do we go from that to this, living paycheck to paycheck, down to one car and we're struggling? Hey, Shannon, it's me. What you up to? You want some company? Okay I'll be there in 20. Now Shannon is my ace, my girl, my boo. I met Shannon at our housewarming with Ant a few years ago. Open table. Hey, you. What's up, Y'all? What's up? What's happening? What's up, Cuz? What's up? So don't be rude. Introduce me to your friend. Cuz, this Lonnie. Lonnie, this Shannon. Lonnie, let me guess, short for... Yolonda. Yolanda, right. Well, Lonnie, nice to meet you. I'm his cousin. Same here. If this idiot give you any problems just let me know. Oh I can handle it and I like him. Ant, I like her. Mm-hmm I like it too. What you say, Boy? What's wrong with you? I don't mean no disrespect, Bro. Just saying. Good looking woman. I'm proud of you. Babe, can you get me a beer? Yeah. You know what, I'm going to come with you. Aye, tell yo hoe get me a drink too, Bro. What you just say to her? What's wrong with you? What the hell is wrong with you! Whoa! whoa! whoa! Nah, don't check me. Check your boy. That's enough! Cuz, take Lonnie upstairs. Let's play this game. But, Ant. Go upstairs! You heard what I said. Just come on. Just come on. Go upstairs. ♪ I'm Dope ♪ What's that guy's problem anyway? Girl, drunk and stupid don't even worry about him. But, like, why did Ant do nothing about it? Trust me, Ant's gonna take care of that. Want one? Oh, I don't smoke. I understand. It's a disgusting habit anyway. SO, um, Are you with Reggie? Oh, girl, no. We just having fun. I am not trying to get serious with anyone. Keep my options open. No commitment, no feeling. Uh, tell me something about your cousin, then? No, I'm sure he's an open book with you. All right, enough time done went by. We should go back down. You got any ice in your freezer? Yeah. Alright, go ahead and grab those paper towels for me. Oh my God! What you got to say now, Boy? I'm sorry I disrespected you. Ever since that day, we were like 2 peas in a pod. As for Ant, he got some that night. It was something about how he defended me that was such a turn-on. Ugh! Just couldn't help myself. So what's going on? It's Ant. He's so different now that he's found a relationship with God. I don't know how to deal with it. Wait, so he's trying to get his life together and you're mad? No. I wanted to get it together. I just... I just don't like the change. He's gotten so soft and calm. I go off on him and he doesn't even put up a fight. Wait, you want to argue and fight? Yes! Girl, why? Because the makeup sex is so good. He puts me in my place. Well, like he used to. Whoa! Slow down Tiger. Today was the first time we did it in months. Really? Yeah. And it was weird. He was all gentle and emotional telling me he loved me and... what's wrong with that? That's not us. Pull my hair, choke me, throw me against the wall, get rough. Hell, just just talk nasty to me. Woo! Well... Let me see this. Bottoms up. All right. So, do you want the "yes man" response, or do you want a real friend response? Keep it real with me. And I'm not just saying this because that's my cousin. You know I don't pick sides. I know girl. Okay, it just seems like you got such a grudge against him that no matter what he does would ever be right. Girl, that man loves you and is willing to give up his life to make yours better. Just give it a try. Shannon, you know how much I sacrificed for him? I completely changed who I was to be with him and now he just wants me to just switch it up again. This is who we are not that. Um-mm, see he gave you that decision, Lonnie. He laid it all out on the table. You chose to be with him. You even chose to marry him. Why are you so mad now that he realized his faults and want to do better? I don't know. He has this version of a woman he expects me to be and, I can't be that woman. But do you still love him? Yeah. Well... Love is patient and kind. Love is... Wait! Wait! Wait! I know you're not about to quote the bible on me? Girl, no. You know I haven't read that. But I do know a little bit about love. And what I do know is if you truly love somebody you'll never turn your back on them. Look You and Ant gave me hope. I always envied what you guys had. Don't lose it over this. You all need each other more, now than before. Ant, I... Good morning. You can do this. Just smile and work your way through it. You got this. Hey, Babe, I made breakfast for you. I'll be in there in a minute. I was thinking you could come home early from work tonight. Why? These bills aren't going to pay themselves. I know, but I know I messed up last night and I want to make it up to you. You sure? What do you think Now, you don't have to do this, but I'll gladly take you up on your offer. Don't answer it You like? I do. Oh yeah. I got to take that, Babe. Mr. Charles? Oh God, really? Hold on, Babe. Are you serious? Are you serious right now? Oh God! Thank you, thank you, thank you, Sir. I'll be down there in a minute. Thank you. Whoa! Thank God! Thank God! Um, hello? Babe, Mr. Charles is retiring and guess who he's turning the dealership over to? Really? That's great. How about we celebrate right now? No, I can't do that, Babe. Oh, but can it just wait 15 minutes? Please? I can't do it, Babe. I got to get down there and sign those papers. We'll celebrate later on tonight, right? Fine. Thank you, Baby. Love you too What a waste of time. What is going on here? I remember the days he couldn't keep his hands off me. The house could be on fire and he'd still try to get it in any time, any place, anywhere, he was always ready. Now this! Well, Anthony, it's all yours now. Thank you, Sir. I won't let you down. You know it's funny for a few years I was praying to god to send me somebody that I could turn the business over to so I can retire, knowing it's in good hands. Eventually, you come through my door. God doesn't make mistakes Praise God! Amen. You take care, Anthony. I know you won't let me down. Enjoy your new vehicle. God bless you. Lonnie? Hey, Babe, I... I wanted to surprise you. For me? Yeah. Congrats. Oh wow! Thanks, Babe. I know it's not new, but I... I thought you could use one being the new owner and all No it's perfect. I'm happy you like it. I love it. With the money from my job we could send you back to school, just like you wanted really? And when you're done with school you can start your business. Great. Aren't you happy? What's wrong? Yes. Yes, I'm... I'm happy. Okay. Well, it's about the time for lunch. I'd love for my beautiful wife to join me. I would like that. Let me go put this back in office, okay. I'll be right back. No, I'm not happy you're a year too late. I should be done with school already, but you put a stop to that. Oh, hey, Babe I just finished enrolling in classes. Come see what I got. Babe, we need to talk. I'm so excited. All my classes are early so I can get home and cook for you before you get home from work Oh, oh, oh my gosh, I almost forgot I need the money to get to school. Did you bring it? Babe! What? Ant, what, what's wrong? I tried... Ant? Where's the money? I tried... I thought I could double it up you gambled away my hard-earned money! Tell me you didn't just gamble away all my money, Anthony! I was trying to win this for us. You did this for you. I never said anything about you gambling away your money because you always found a way to get it back but this was my money that I worked for. I saved this money so that I could finish school you blew it. I could fix this. How? Oh, with one hand. I gave you one job. I asked you to pick up my money and bring it to me and you couldn't even do that. This was the only thing I wanted and you took it away from me. You sure you can't um apply to any financial aid No, Anthony! They gave me all I could get. I'm already in debt with loans and I'm not adding to it. I shouldn't have to. How did you do this to me, Anthony? You took it. You took it from me. Damn you fine! And that ass. Whoo! Mm-mm-mm. Excuse you! Oh I'm sorry, Sexy. Didn't mean to offend you. Oh I see you must be one of them stuck up whores. What did you call me? I'm sorry. Did I say whore? I meant Bitch! Hey hey, Bro, we got a problem here? Nigga, who you supposed to be? Man, I'm her husband and this is my property I need you to get up out of here Or what? Man, this the last warning, Bro I need you to get up out of here right now, Bro I know you got like a felony or a warrant or something. Don't make these police run your name. Damn shame. Your wife got more balls than you. Let's go, Babe. One more thing you think I'm gonna talk to you after you didn't have my back. You got some damn nerves. I got some nerves? I had your back. Now, if I would have fought him I risk losing everything maybe if my husband would act like a man I wouldn't have to look elsewhere to see what a real man looks like. What did you just say to me? You heard me. You go around here acting all righteous when you the worst of them all. Here you go again bringing up my past again. You need to let it go. You're the reason I am the way I am. I wasn't this way before I made the mistake of falling for you. You made this bed, now you sleep in it. Tell me I'm lying. You know you right. And I did bring you into this life and I'm sorry for that. But now I'm fighting to bring you into a better one. God forgave me. Why can't you? Never! I wish you would be that man again. At least he knew how to fight for me. And more importantly, he knew how to please me in every way. Now you ain't nothing but a weak, pathetic church boy You ain't no real man. That's why I got alternatives what you're just say? What? You gonna hit me? You couldn't hit a dude earlier, but you can hit me. Come on then, weak, little boy, hit me then. Just like I thought. Go on in there. Cry to God. God, please, help me? I'm gonna go to my mom's for a while So, I'll need to use the key. I'll bring it back. I'll bring Mom to follow me. Baby, this not the way we handle things. Ant, I can't do it anymore. I can't be this... this woman that you want me to be. I hate this fantasy world that you live in. More than anything I'm, I'm angry at myself for allowing you to change me into this monster. Then that night happened And everything changed and you just expect me to switch it up again. Baby, I said I'm sorry. We can fix this, I promise. It's too late, Ant. Goodbye. Hey sweetie you love distressed. You want to talk about it? Mama I can't do it anymore. It's Ant. Things are different. It's not the same. It's funny Sweetie, when I first met Ant, I did not like him. And then he changed his life, and I actually liked him. You love him now, huh? He remind me of Daddy. He's such a protector Is that why you fell for Ant? The protection? Yes. One night your father got drunk and he murdered a man for making a pass at me. Wasn't he just defending you? That's not protection. That's stupidity. I mean I was his everything and now I have to compete with God Honey, you sound like that same little lost child We adopted all those years ago what? God comes first then the spouse, and then the kids. Once you put anything before God all hell breaks loose. Why? Because God won't have another god before him What do you... What do you mean? Your dad, when we met put me on a pedestal and then, when we adopted you he put you on a pedestal right next to me. And now he's locked up behind bars for the rest of his life. And if Ant had not changed his life he would be sitting in bars right with your dad. That night changed Ant completely. Even the good qualities left, Mom. God saved Ant's life. And one day you're gonna realize it. Sweetie, I'm going to bed. Good night. Hey, my boy. What's up, Pops. Happy birthday, Man. Thanks, Man. Hey, Baby. There go that fool right there. Yup. Get ready. You guys want anything to eat or drink? No, I'm good. Nah, no thank you. We good. Okay, I'll be inside. All right. This chessboard is real beautiful, Son. All glass! I love it. I knew you would. So, that's your move? Yes, Sir. So, what's your next move? I don't know, Pops. That was a nice move you just did. I'm not talking about the game, Boy. What you talking about? I'm talking about with you and Lonnie. Lonnie? Oh, we good man. We have our ups and downs, but what couple don't? Boy, I know heartbreak when I see it and that woman is heartbroken. She hurting. Things have happened. And she's done things too. But we good though we always will be. Boy, you... You still about as clueless as you were when you were a kid. Check. So, what you're saying? I'm not a man? Look, Son, the Bible says that the man supposed to be the head of his household The leader of his family. If the family wins or loses, it's on his watch. The bible also says that a woman has to submit to her husband. But first you need a man to submit to. Checkmate. So it's all my fault. Nothing's on Lonnie, huh? Look the bible says when I was a child, I spoke as a child I thought as a child. When I became a man, I put away childish things. Son, you still out here drinking, smoking gambling hell fighting You probably made some enemies on your way here today. Don't you see all that affects her? Look she's not the same woman that you introduced me to, Son. That woman's changed. So, when are you gonna put away childish things and become the man that she truly needs? So, what you trying to say? I am a man. Look We all want that Proverbs 31 woman that virtuous woman. But, see, we as men What we forget to realize is we have to be that man in order for them to be that woman. Son, without God involved you're never going to be the man. She's never going to be one the woman that you need. That's just how it works, Son. So is this what, so that's what you think about me? Is this what, is this what mom thought about you before she died? Look son I made my mistakes and I can admit that, but as your father, it is my job to make sure you don't follow in my footsteps. You got to do better, Son. Man, look, hey happy birthday, Pops. Lonnie, let's go. Son, wait. Anthony, wait! Look, I know I might not be the man that you and God intended for me to be but I'm telling you, I'm a man. Then, prove it, Son. Be the man you supposed to be. I'm only telling you this because I want you to know the truth, Son. I love you, Man. Lonnie, I said let's go. I heard you the first time. Aye, yo, ANT! Son, Get down! Pops! Pops! Pops! Pops! Somebody help! That she need, Son. Come on, Pops, I need you. Oh my God! Oh my God! He died later that night. Truth be told, so much more than that was lost that night. I knew it. Keith! Keith, wake up. What you want? I thought you were going to come to church. What time is it? It's nine o'clock Why church got to be so early? Look, are you coming, or not? I don't want to be late. If church going to be this early, you going without me. Figures! Watch your mouth, woman. Don't be mad. God make us wait for everything we want. He can wait for me to go to church. Who can find a virtuous woman? See I thought I was one. I do everything a wife is supposed to do So... how did we get here? How did it end up from what we had to this? Well, I guess the only way to find out is to take a trip down memory lane. Draft day, the second round and Keith, he's hoping to hear his name get called. See, football is one of the few things he loved. God and myself oh we were the other two. Babe, it's gonna be okay. They are going to call you? You think so? Oh I know so. But let's pray on it. All right, let's do it. Gather your hands, y'all. Dear God, please be with Keith on this journey. Ah! look at us. We were two church kids who grew to love each other. At that time we were inseparable. And God... God was the center of our relationship. In Jesus name, amen. Amen. Now, let's sit here and wait for your name to get called. You're right. And for the first pick of the second round Indianapolis choose Keith Garrett. Let's go! Let's Go! We are here! We on now! We on Now! We on now! Let's GO! See! Baby, I told you it was going to happen. You did, you did. I did. Calm down, Y'all. I want to say something. I want to say something. First and foremost, I want to thank God. This probably was the best day of my life. This was the man I fell in love with and God was the foundation. Your love your patience your strength. You believe in me when I don't even believe in myself. I love you more than anything Oh, Babe, I love you too. I don't want to go on this journey without you. Hey, you know I'm not going anywhere. I know that. But listen Angel will you do the honor of marrying me? Yes! Yes! We get married! We got married six months later. And for the next couple years, he was living his dream. Then, one day something happened that changed everything. Keith tore his ACL. I got it, I got it. Do you need anything? I'm good. I just want to chill. Okay, you call me if you need anything. Mm-hmm God, please help us get through this? Heal him father. In Jesus name, amen. God Just let me get back on that field. Please? I know this can't be all that's left for me. God I've been praying to you for years about my marriage. It seems like the more I pray the worse Keith gets. All that he's put me through and a part of me still holds on to what could be. Help me, Lord. Tell me what to do because I just don't know anymore. I'm sure you're wondering why did I just say that prayer concerning my marriage. Well, this is where things begin to go downhill. Keith's knee caused him to miss the rest of the season. The rehab wasn't working and his knee, it just wasn't healing as expected. It seems like the longer it took the more he began to change. It seems like drinking became the normal thing to do. Drinking led to other things and before long God was nothing but an afterthought to him. What's wrong, Babe? How could you be so calm right now like everything is okay? Because I have faith. God will get us through this. Us? Ain't no us in this. I'm the one injured. I'm the one going to therapy. I'm the one with crutches. Not us. Me! And I've been there with you every step of the way, Keith. I've never left your side through it all. I'm the one working doubles to take care of things around here. I take you back and forth to appointments. On top of cooking and cleaning while you're sitting around here your feelings. So the truth comes out now, huh? What? You blame me for this. I never said that. You pretty much just did. You think this is my fault? Well it isn't! I was going hard every day. I was living my dream Then, God... Your God, he took that away from me. Maybe, God just let it happen to show you the real you. What? See about that. Say it again. Are you serious right now? I don't hear you talking now. Say something. Come here Supposed to been there for me but you changed just like everybody else. I couldn't at all right now. Now get up and clean this mess up. Clean yourself up too. That was the first time he ever put his hands on me. Baby, I'm sorry for what I did last night. Baby, please forgive me. I'll do whatever it take. Baby, ain't you going to say something? I'll be home later. That's all? Your therapist will be here soon. Ah! Weeks go by. There's no hug no kiss and barely even conversation Um, unless we were arguing about something stupid. I thought I told you not to get... Keith? What's wrong? It's my brother, Kevin. He was in the car accident. Oh my god? Is he okay? I don't know. They said he need surgery. It's going to be okay. I'm here for you. I'll pray to you. I need you right now. No. Baby, I can't be alone right now. I gave in. What? I hate to see him in pain. Turns out his brother was okay. Nothing too serious. It did feel good to get back to the way things were. Overtime Keith's knee got better, but no team was trying to sign him. It was frustrating But he still would come home and cook for me buy me roses and give me massages and the passion, it was there but if only I could get him to let God back in Yeah Hey, don't play with me man. Really. Thank you. Bet, bet, bet. I'll be there tomorrow. Yes! What's going on, Babe? I got a meet with the Chicago Bears tomorrow. What! They want me, Babe. Oh my God! Congratulations, Honey! Thank you, thank you, thank you. Couldn't have done this without you. I know you couldn't. See, I told you. Prayer works. Uh, yeah it does. Right. Right The one thing we were missing. I thought God had finally answered my prayers. Here I thought things were getting back to the way they once were. That feel okay? Yeah, that feel fine. Guess I missed something along the way. Baby, Baby! Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby. Hey, How you doing? Hi. You're home early. Yeah. I wasn't feeling too good so I left. Oh, yeah? What was wrong? You all right? Why are you sweating and out of breath? I was exercising. Oh. I'm trying to get back in the league, you know. Okay. Well, I got some good news! Oh yeah? what is it? what is it? Um... Keith... why do you have glitter on your shirt? I don't see... You know what. Aye. Aye, what you doing? Babe, what you looking for? What are you looking for? What are you doing? Move. Babe Babe, what you doing? You tweaking out. Babe, what you doing? Keith, why is this been messed up and it smelled like sex in this room? Babe, I told you I was working out, then I was about to take a nap. You came through the door... all right. Okay. Okay. Babe, what are you doing? If you in here, come out now Baby it ain't... or I'm gonna start shooting on a count of three. Babe, you just gonna be... ONE! There's nobody here. Wait! Wait! Wait! Oh my gosh. Don't you please, please don't shoot? Rachel, you was supposed to leave. Rachel! Are you kidding me? I'm just tripping, Keith? Your damn therapist! Let me explain. Baby, it's not what it looks like. Get out! Baby, let me explain. You and your slut get out my house now! Baby let me fix this. Just listen to me. Are you going to leave, or do I need to shoot you in your knee? Baby, I'm gone. I'm a go. We going to have to talk... Now We going to have to fix this. Now! Hey. And don't forget your liquor and your steroids. I guess being faithful isn't the only thing you've been lying about. Babe I... Please. Just go. You know what I hope it was all worth it. Damn it I don't know why this was happening. Where did it all go wrong? All the praying and I still get this! Ah. Oh my God. Ah! No, God. No Please, no! I lost the baby I was devastated Keith was back home. Every minute of him being there just reminded me of what he had did. Hey, I wanted to surprise you with dinner. He stayed in one room, I stayed in another one. No physical contact at all. I already ate. Babe, wait. You've got to be kidding me. Keith. A few months had gone by and I figured it was time we talked. Sit down. we need to talk. Look, I want you to know that I really appreciate you being here for me. Of course I'm here. But this changes nothing. What you did is unforgivable. You broke my heart. You betrayed me. I know and I'm sorry. Why? I thought things were getting better. I, I don't know. Figures. Oh, and I don't want to hear no I love yous or no I'm sorry. What's done it's done. I'm going to bed. I have church tomorrow. Wait, Angel. What do you want, Keith? I was thinking maybe I'll go to church with you tomorrow. Really? Why all of a sudden? I ain't doing nothing to deserve it but I was thinking maybe God could forgive me and one day you'll be able to forgive me too. You just worry about God forgiving you. Be ready at 9am. Excuse you. I'm sorry. Please help me through this? Angel, Uh... I'm sorry about this morning I was... Drunk. Yeah, I know. I could smell the liquor on you. Wait, wait. I got to... What do you want, Keith? I gotta tell you something. Can you please come sit down? So, uh... I gotta cut from the team. Why? They found the steroids in my system. What did you expect? You should have known they were gonna check. Is that it? So, this how you gonna react? What did you think was gonna happen? This is your mess. You clean it up. Damn it Even though things were the way they were I still prayed. I wanted to know was it something I could do to save this marriage or just to let it go. Then one day I got the answer I was looking for. Hey, Angel, can I talk to you for a second? About what? Can you just sit down? I want to tell you this before you hear from someone else. This woman that I... Uh, she pregnant. Well, I've heard enough. There is nothing more to be said. Oh, hey. You want some breakfast? Uh... No thank you. Sit down and have some breakfast, Keith. Are you okay? Yeah. Why wouldn't I be? Why? Why are you in such a good mood? I thought... I, I thought... You thought what? That I was going to be sitting around here my feelings. Nah. See, I got the confirmation that I've been looking for. I have you to thank for that. In fact. Um. What's that? What happened to us? We used to be so good. We were doing so much better. Is this the end for us? Really? In the middle of me trying to explain to you where we went wrong. You don't have anything to say? What's this? This? You know what. Matter of fact it's time for you to try my little surprise. Angel, what is this? Divorce papers, Keith. What! Angel, look. SHHH There is nothing more to be said. You've made your bed now sleep in it. Angel, give me a chance to fix this. Signing the papers will fix this. Obviously, I wasn't enough. See, God has been trying to show me the truth. I've just been ignoring them until now. So do me a favor and just let me go. I'm not saying no papers! Oh, yes you are signing these because I'm gonna file anyways. So, we can either do this the easy way, or we can do it the hard way. Don't you think you've done enough? Just give me this one thing. I deserve that much. Can I help you, Ma'am? Yes Um... I'm looking for something different Something new. Angel, right? Yeah, and you're Anthony from church, right? That's me. Okay. Well, let's see if we can get you in a new car today. Okay. Right this way. All right. Thanks Hey, wait. I was wondering if you want to go on the date with me. Really? Yes, really. You know what, sure. How about tomorrow night? It's a date. You have my number in your paperwork. Cool. All right. You have a good day. You too. All right. Bye. Woo! Lonnie, your ride is outside. Okay, I'll be out in a moment. Come here, Child. How do you leave your husband and get pregnant by a married man? They ain't married no more, Mama. He was when you got pregnant. Okay, Mom. Lonnie, you're walking down a road of destruction. And you're just too blind to see it. Bye, Mom. I love you, Child. So, I already gave you guys your sugar and your aloe vera juice for your base. For your sugar scrub, just pour a little bit in. Mix it. If it smells to your liking you can pour more or you can pour less. Okay And then let me know if you guys have any questions, okay? All right So, how long have you been a doctor? For about six years now. Oh yeah, that's what's up. How long have you sold cars? I've been there a few years. The owner actually passed the dealership to me about a year ago. Oh what! Now that's what's up. So, if my car breaks down I know exactly who to blame. Yeah, that's cool. I guarantee the best. We shall see. I know I may sound a bit nervous. It's been a while since the split. No, you're doing fine. How long it's been? About a year. Same here. Kind of glad it happened too. I could really be who I am with God and myself. Because if I wasn't I wouldn't be here with such a beautiful woman of God right now. Don't be trying to run game on me. Nah, no game. Just stating facts. Well, the feeling is mutual. I'm so glad you guys had fun. Thank you so much for coming. Thank you. Have a nice day. You too. There was an instant connection between us and God was the centerpiece. The more we were around each other the stronger feelings got. We talked about everything. We talked about God, each other's past. We even talked about Lonnie and Keith. We discussed future goals and anything that came to mind. Things seemed like it was moving so fast. It's only been three months and I was deep in my feelings. It was something different something so refreshing something new. I've come to learn that when God is moving in your life Satan isn't far behind trying to knock you down. Excuse me, I have an appointment. Okay, hi. I'm Dr. Angel Garrett. I'm Yolanda but everyone calls me Lonnie. Lonnie. Do I know you know you? No. You know what come on in. Have a seat. My former doctor recommended me to you. I guess you're one of the best around. Well, thank you. And, yes, your doctor did send me over all your test results. But here's the problem. It looked like you tested positive for very high levels of alcohol in your system. There's a possibility that the baby will be affected by this. I got depressed when I found out I was pregnant. Started drinking a lot. I guess I never put the bottle down. Especially knowing who his deadbeat daddy is. He made me all these promises and couldn't even keep one appointment. You live and you learn, right? Hey, I get it, but there's a possibility that the baby will develop F.A.S.D, which is fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. We're going to have to monitor extremely closely. All right Okay, so, if you need anything be sure to call the office. Also I'm going to need to see you back in one week. Will do. Okay. So, you're the one. I'm sorry. The one Ant fell for. I heard about you. Yeah, We're together. Ant's a good man. He deserves a good woman. I hope you can give him what he needs. God knows I couldn't. Wow okay Come in. Hi, Angel. Keith! What are you doing here? I'm here for an appointment. Oh, so, you're pregnant? Um, the... the mother had an appointment. Hmm. What's her name? Yolanda Lonnie. Yeah, that's her. Yep, you just missed her. I missed another one. Are you okay? Nah. Between the child support and another baby on the way the league tired of me. I really hit rock bottom. Look if you need some help, I know... Nah. Umm... I deserve this, right? Okay, well, you take care of yourself. Um, look, I never told you, uh.. I'm sorry. Thanks. Oh, yeah happy birthday Angel. Hey, You. Hey. I'm fine. How are you? I'll be even better when I see you. I have to talk to you about something. Everything cool? No, everything's good. All right, then. So, I'll see you later at seven? Seven p.m., sharp. Okay. Bye Bye, bye. Hey, You. Hey, happy birthday, Beautiful. Thank you. Wow! You look amazing Well, dinner will be ready in a minute. Shall we? Mm-hmm. Wait. Before we start I need to tell you something. What's going on? So, I met Lonnie today. Well, she's my new patient. How'd that go? Well, the baby is Keith's. Congrats to them. Wait, you're not bothered by this? Nah. The past is the past. I'm right here where I want to be at right now. Well, alrighty then. Shall we have a seat? Mm-hmm. Let me take these okay. I got you something. Oh... okay. Close your eyes And open them. Wait what's this? With this lock right here it represents me. I was closed off and my heart was locked away from everyone. And with this key right here it represents you because you the key will set me free. God sent you to set me free. You showed me that I don't have to be afraid to let someone in. I've done all this to show you that I love you. God doesn't make any mistakes. And this isn't a mistake. And with both our past it brought us right here together. I love you so much. God doesn't always answer your prayers as expected but at this moment I realized that this man is my gift from God. So I ask who can find a virtuous woman? For her prices above all rubies. The heart of her husband doth trust in her so that he shall have no need of spoil. She do him good all the days of her life. Proverbs 31 verse 10 through 12. Husbands love your wife even as Christ loved the church and gave himself for it. Ephesians 5: 25.
