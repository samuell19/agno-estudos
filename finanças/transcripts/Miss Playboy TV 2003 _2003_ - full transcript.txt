The weather forecast is different here. We could see the stars on our way here... Other people who reached the top must not have seen it. Don't be angry. We're lucky to find this place. Come here, it's cold there. You scientists will never find out the substance of a particle. The ultimate substance... it's unknowable. That kind of obsession is not different from a material desire. You know the phrase 'the empty is the full.' Yes, I'm full of desire. I'm sorry, I was late. You know Yoo Sung-U Thousands of shooting stars will fall like rain next year. Let's go see it. - Really? - Yeah... you want some coffee? No, thank you. It's really solid one. No problem inside, marks outside will remain forever though. Repair these too.

We had kept fighting. Why did you fight? She insisted she can't divorce because of kids, That can't be a reason for wielding the knife. We fought until 4 o'clock a.m. When we got to the Seoul Station and suddenly he grabbed a knife in the empty train. To be kicked out of my house, 'cause my husband found out everything. After that I managed to get a job at the club and met this guy there again. Why do we live like this? If you didn't wield the knife... You started this fucking play with fire...! Yun-Sil, Jae-Min, Oh, my poor children, my husband would not let me see them. You know, I had to go to jail for. And now you became a singer. Right! My dream was to be a singer. Her dream was to be a singer! Where were you? On the hill, back there. Hill? - You got water from the hill. - Yes, It's fresh. What happened to my memory? What's this about a knife and persimmons? The woman likes persimmons, and wanted to buy some before getting on the train. They didn't have a knife... But then, the seller gave them a knife. So...? While travelling from Pusan to Seoul, they ate up all persimmons... I got it. So with that knife he did it. Only if you don't drink so much! That's the way I am. Anyway it's OK 'cause you remember. Wait... l'm going to have coverage on Mongolia and central Asia. I can hook you up to be my photographer, if you want. Mongolia! When? Whenever you see the light, push the button. Now look straight on a head... Put your chin there! You'll be able to see all of Seoul as if you're looking down from the sky, Please enjoy,,, Have you heard about tubular vision? Tubular vision? No. It's a disease when the field of vision gets narrowed as a tunnel. But eyesight is OK? It's getting worse too. In most cases, they get lost. What's the actual name of the disease? Retinitis Pigmentosa. And? That's what I got. Well, but no one knows whether it's gonna get worse or stop. Sojung, so how is it now? It's OK for the moment. Any way to cure it? No, not now. What causes it? Well... it could be genetic or environment or anything... Who knows...? Why did this have to happen to us? Why? Did you go on location? You never came to see me, Well... to avoid more work... I turned off my phone. Why? It's still early. I decided not to go abroad to study. What are you talking about? It's been a long time. I mean... we'd better break up... I can't bear it anymore. Your eyesight got worse? We decided to keep going as planned. Sojung, what are you going to do for several months alone. Let's go together. No, I won't go. You just go alone. - Why are you doing this? - I won't go. I don't want to. Tell me honestly. Are you seeing another guy? No, it's not like that. What's going on then? Everything is so uncertain. It's ridiculous to go study photography now. And I might want to join the team leaving for Mongolia this fall. Anything left? Anything left? Two years we spent together, is that nothing to you? It's too easy and one-sided. We don't even know what'll happen to your eyes. 1 year or 2 years or 10 years? Even in the worst case it's much better for you to be in America. You're totally right. But' I don't wanna do that You, selfish egoist! In the end you'll be stuck in your lab and I'll be left in the darkness alone. That's the only thing you can think? Don't you think we were destined to meet each other? Well, I think it was by chance. I said it's destiny 'cause it was an incredible chance. There's no destiny. It's just a kind of chance. What? What did I say when we started this relationship? I said don't start if we can't go through. - Jisuk! Leave me alone! - You always do what you want to do You decide the begining and the end... Don't... Family Hurry up. We have to leave. - I'm home. - You're early today. Look at this. The whole town showed up. - Didn't you go back to Seoul? - No. You want some? No! I'm gonna get dinner soon. I'm home. Papa I'm starving. Didn't even get lunch. I'm cooking rice. You want to have some dishes first? Fix it quickly. - Poke mongs. - Repeat again. Pocket monster. Poke mongs. - Poc. Ket. Mons. Ter. - Poke mongs. P-o-c-k-e-t- m-o-n-s-t-e-r, pocket monster. Pokemong! How dare? Minsu! What's wrong with you? Don't I look alright? Well, it's strange. You stay here so long and look depressed. Just to take a rest at home. Going abroad would make you miss home! - Mom? - Why? Nothing... Mom... Among our family, is there anyone who has bad eyesight? Eyesight? You have bad eyesight! You read too much when you were a kid. I mean, someone else... - My brother wears glasses, and... - No... I mean... I don't know your father's side. This funeral ceremony got me exhausted. Sojung, let's go together with your car. Where? It seems your family has trees. What? I see trees. In our family...? There's no such thing. I see two trees. There's no such thing... You've been in peace for a long time. You shouldn't get on his nerve! What are you doing now? Where are you going? This might not be the place. It's been a long time. Since I last came here. I understand. He, I mean your grand father, an educated and rich man I heard, might have been involved in the Tonghak Revolution, or might have lost all his money because of concubines... I'm not sure since he died young. We need a saw. Let me go and get it. They won't grow any more with this and their roots will get dry. You, go and get your wife and baby this weekend. I will. It's so often... It's not long after your grandma died. You need to be careful about bad rumour. It's not easy to be an bureaucrat. Whew! Minsu! Take this! What happended? You were sleeping from early this evening. What kind of nightmare did you have? Let her sleep. Go have dinner. Hey, what's wrong? You know his temper. How come you always get on his nerve! Have we tranquilizers? Such a stubborn girl! We did everything... I thought we have no more trouble... During the mourning period for your grandma, why do you keep causing trouble? Go and get your wife and son! Now he is an adult. Kill me! Kill me! Spit it out. Is it hot? My heart is beating, I tell only you, I'm 17 years old, Come gently come softly under the willow tree in the shy starlight, Come gently,,, Smile It's out of focus in the film. I think something wrong with your auto focus. It was a manual camera. That was the last picture I took for the day. My eyes must have been very tired. The other one is really nice. Bring other film, then I'll print it agian. It's OK. This is Sojung. About the Future Buddha project... The thinking Buddha pictures I took are printed out? Already? How are the pictures? Nothing... just... Yes, I'll be there. See you then. Good! But one more close-up of the face would have been great. Why are they so out of focus! Someone said lmpressionism was created by painters with bad eyesight. So, I experimented with photographs to see what would happen. There was an Indian painter who used to be blind in one eye. Later, he lost the sight of the other one. However, he still paints, with a helper boy. But, photography is a different case. I knew you wouldn't like it. Then why did you show me? What do you think about me working in a studio? You said you like traveling around better. Well, that's true. It's 3,000 won. Enjoy! I should've ordered one more dish. That's fine. You got your hair permed. Yeah. It still smells? No. You are wearing a new sweater. Colleagues of my department presented it. Isn't it a bit dark? Looks nice. When are you going to leave? Tomorrow. It's later than you planned. Yes... What time? 9:20 a.m. 9:20 Then, it won't be night When you arrive there. Yeah... You're not going to give up photography, are you? Well, I don't know yet. Jisuk, will you tell me when you get to know this... whether I'm programmed like this or what is programmed is me? If you change your mind, come to me. If my mind changes. My hairs doesn't smell? Yes, it does. I'm at my aunt's home to write a short story. I was gonna go up to Seoul this week, but got a reporting job. It's about Kyungju city. Come here to take photographs. It's not far from here. This area is my... Hello. Yeah. You're so hard to reach... Well... Are they working here? You mean "A Passionate duet Sook & Chul"? They left last month and we have a better group now. Can you go to Mongolia? I'll be fine. I'm going to ride a horse In Mongolia, too. Has Jisuk gone? We broke up. You guys were in love too much. Was there any problem between you and him? It happens. People meet and separate in their lives... You say as if you lived one hundred years. I mean, I've heard people say that. Wow! Nice! What? Nothing special. A hill and old trees in the middle of city! Yeah... it's an old tomb. - A tomb? - Yes, cross over this street, there are bigger tombs of kings. See it again if you want. This is the other side of it. It's only a tomb and trees... Sojung, any place you wanna go? Well, when my grandfather had a stroke His concubine for 20 years left him. During the whole life time he had been a notable playboy. But when he got sick, he came back home. It's a pity my aunt should take care of him. Anyway he is poor too. Hello. Yeah. Now I'm OK. One moment. You're my guest for my birthday, especially as a representative of photographers. Your birthday? Younger ones are too busy to remember things. It was me who got a small camera in this city for the first time. Oh, it was you! The pictures I took when I was young are somewhere. Someone must have taken it off. I did the calligraphy there. You did it all? No. No. The powerful one on the left, I did that. Grandpa, what are you doing? You know where the picture on the wall is? The one of this house and the landscape. I guess I saw it when I was a kid. Dad might put it away. Let's look for it. This is where you want to go? You gave me a choice. There's nothing to see... only a lotus feature on the ceiling. In the North area, many frescos have still remained in the ancient tombs. The painting of the Sun, the Moon, Constellation, big trees even the flying God and goddess in clothes with wings. Were they clothes? I thought they were wings risen under their armpits. It's clothes. They are called Chuni or Wooi. Gods fly because they have clothes With wings? They have these clothes because they are Gods. I' II go there alone. - Are you OK alone? - Absolutely. I'll be back soon. Fright We need at least 3 months. But if you're in hurry, let's make it intensive. Then you must pay more. Yeah, I agree. Just kidding... Everyone who takes lessons here are very serious, work harder if you want to do a solo flight in such a short period of time. I know, I'll work hard. I know you can't carry all of this but won't you miss them? Further, to buy all of them there again... Well... you can get a lot of used stuffs in America. - I'll keep this one. - OK. You're really stubborn! I told you that you can't. It's so tough to come here a few times a week. I'll stay here until my first solo flight. It won't take long. I passed the driving test on my first trial. Know it would be different from flight, though... I'm so nervous. Let me read your palm-lines. You have a long life. Don't worry about it. I have to go to the restroom. Thank you! Sojung, what are you up to since you won't study abroad? I'm going to marry the photographer who came here instead of you, But we're quarrelling everyday as we explore Mongolia,,, Can you hear it? Because of this music, I fell in love with this guy, Jeen! One more try! OK. One more try! It's foggy so often because of the river. It's not a good place for an airfield. Is this the South Han River? Where does it flow? Well... to the West Sea? Shall we drink some beer? I was just kidding about flying around the world. Flying high gives a broad vision. Right, a broad vision... I had a dream like that when I applied to the air force in the age of 19... Flying high and going anywhere... It was good. It's because you haven't done it lately. Me too. No. It's because I got sober. Shall we give up? Last year, a gardner took a lesson. When he got the license, he presented me these three. What happened to this one? Well, there always exists a healthy one and sick one too. It's just like that. Let's do it... Let's do it... Let's do it... Let's do it... Now I don't want to... Let's do it... Let's do it... If you want to, stay awake. Sojung! Yesterday, it was windy day here, I remembered the first day we have met, I'm sorry I wasn't there for you when you needed me most, Even though Man evolves much more and the Science develops brilliantly, We only perceive things within the limited ways of perception of each individual, Then why do you always want to look beyond the boundaries,,,? This is the answer to your last question, A Zen priest wrote this poem looking at the mirror before he died, 80 years ago Thou art I, and now 80 years after I am Thou Sojung! I know there are a lot of unknowns and worries but I want us to go through them together, ,,, to missing Sojung From Jisuk, Boston The weather is caprious 'cause you're gonna leave soon. I know you're ready for your solo flight but let's wait for a better day. Let's go out together. I'm OK. I'll watch TV. Did I lock the door? This animal took after the nebula lives in the deep sea,,, Here! Jeen!
