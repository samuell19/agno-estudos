(SCREECHING) (HONKING) (LAUGHING) (WELCOME TO THIS DAY PLAYING) Waking up in the light Of a shiny new day Giving thanks to the moon for guiding my way There is no greater gift to the soul Than each breath that my body can hold So, great spirits Hear my voice today Welcome, magic Welcome, sweet sun ray Love is no secret Look all around you Welcome to this day (LAUGHING) -(RUTT AND TUKE SCREAMING) -BOTH: Whoa! Look out! She's after us, eh! -Oh, jeez. -You gotta help us! -You gotta hide us, eh. -Oh, jeez. Too late. Here she comes! (SNIFFING) (SNORTING) I told you that was no moosette. Well, she looked like one from behind. What's gotten into you two? -Well, it's that time of year, eh. -Spring fever. Spring what? -Yeah, you know, like the birds. -Yeah, and the bees. And the moosettes. If you know what we mean by moosettes. Yeah, well, don't look now, but your girlfriend's back. (SINGING) Look all around you Welcome, magic Welcome, sweet sun ray Love is no secret Look all around you Welcome to this day (GIGGLING) Awesome! Let's do it again. (LAUGHS) TUG: (LAUGHS) Hey, Kenai. -Hiya, Tug. -Where y'all off to in such a hurry? Crowberry Ridge. We're gonna get dibs. There's elderberries, salmonberries, raspberries, whortleberries, strawberries, huckleberries, crowberries... Hey, hey, slow down now. That's a lot of berries. Yeah, there's plenty. You wanna come with us? Yoo-hoo! Tug! (LAUGHS) Well, I'd love to, little Koda, but can't keep the girls waiting. Aw, who needs girls? We're two footloose guys out on the tundra. That's right. Kenai and Koda. We don't need anybody else. Okay, but you can't run from love. HOONAH: Tug! It has a way of tracking you down. (CHUCKLES) Hi, Hoonah. You look mighty lovely today. (BOTH LAUGHING) Did you see the look on Tug's face? "Can't keep the girls waiting." All right. How about we get some rest? Rest? We've been hibernating for six months. -Who needs rest? -Who needs rest? A couple bears who are gonna beat all the other bears to Crowberry Ridge. And we're gonna get first dibs on the berries, right? Yeah, you bet. -If you promise to go to sleep. -Okay, okay. (SIGHS) I know all bears like berries, but I love berries. Good night, Koda. Are you a berry-liker or a berry-lover? Good night, Koda. (WIND HOWLING) Nita! Kenai! Whoo! Yeah! (LAUGHING) -Race you to Hokani Falls! -Wait up! (EXCLAIMING EXCITEDLY) Here I come! (SCREAMS) (GASPS) Nita! (MUFFLED SCREAMS) (SNIFFLES AND SNEEZES) Here. We're always gonna be best friends, huh? Huh? BOTH: Wow. MAN: Nita, time to go! Goodbye, Kenai. (BOTH LAUGHING) See you! Bye, Nita! Bye, Nita. (ECHOING) (MUMBLING) Bye, Nita. Uh? KODA: So, who's Nita? Huh? What? Did you know you talk in your sleep? You were going, "Nita! Nita!" So who's Nita? She's a girl I used to know. Whatever happened to her? I don't know. I guess she grew up. He's here! He's here! -The groom is here! -We must hurry. Let us prepare. GIRL: Hurry up! I wanna see him. I wanna see Atka. BOY: Nita, he's here! They're here. Prepare for the ceremonies. He must have brought his entire village with him. Well, my sweet, this marriage is extremely important. That's why we came to help you get ready. Oh, no, no. That's okay. I can get myself ready. Ah, go ahead. Use all the water. Then we'll just air dry your hair. Air dry? Certainly not. Towel dry is shinier. You know... We'll put your hair up to show off your beautiful eyes. Up? No, down, of course, to frame that beautiful face. No, we're gonna put it up to show it off better. -Down. -Up. -Down. -Up. -I'm gonna say down. -Uh... Oh, she's nervous. She needs to eat. -I'll go get some smoked salmon. -But I... Salmon? On a nervous stomach? She needs hackberry root steeped in rainwater. In the morning? No! No, no, I'm fine. I think I'll feel better when I'm dressed. BOTH: Dressed? I have just the outfit for you. Oh, but you don't understand. I already have one picked out. Simple reindeer hide. Slimming, yet elegant. No, caribou. Feathers. Lots of beads. -Beads? Are you nuts? -Reindeer for a wedding? -No more beads. -Seashells, then. -What is it with you and your seashells? -I love seashells! Hey! I do believe I am feeling a bit hungry. -I'll get the salmon. -I'll get the tea. Okay. Get plenty of both. (GIGGLES) You look as beautiful in that dress as your mother did on our wedding day. Thanks, Daddy. I wanted to wear something of hers today. Oh, that means so much to me. Your mother would be so proud. I wish she was here. Oh, she is. In here. Once you love someone, they stay in your heart forever. (DRUMS BEATING) Are you ready to meet Atka? (PEOPLE CHANTING) WOMAN: Psst. -Hmm? -Mmm-hmm. (MUSIC STOPS) Great spirits, we come before you today to bond this man and this woman as one. We pray this pleases you. (THUNDER CRASHES) (BOTH EXCLAIM IN WONDER) (WOMAN SCREAMS) MAN: Watch out! Nita! The spirits are trying to tell us something. WOMAN: It must be a sign. (STAMMERS) I don't understand. How could this happen? The villagers say it's a sign. The villagers? What the heck do they know? Do you want the advice of the villagers or a professional? Oh, no, definitely a professional. They say that in all the tribes, you are the wisest shaman. Sha-woman, okay? "Wise" and "man" don't even belong in the same sentence. Let's get down to business. So the ice cracked right out from under you. Sure you haven't put on a few pounds? Come on, girl to girl. No, my weight's been constant. Well, lucky you, Miss Constant Weight. Tell you what. Why don't we just ask the spirits, okay? -Hmm. -(VOICES WHISPERING) Uh-huh. Yeah. What? What are they saying? Don't interrupt. It ain't all about you. Uh-huh. They say... You can't marry Ka-ka! -Atka. -Whatever. The point is, you're already matched up, Miss Two Timer. (STAMMERS) Already matched up? To whom? To the one who gave you this. Look at that picture. That thing is crystal clear. Kenai? The bear boy? Oh, no, no. We were just kids. I've heard that one before. Oh, there has to be a way to undo this. Undo it? You can't undo what's been done. It's done. Case closed. No more conversation. Ooh! There is one way. You must go and eat an ox! What? Oh, wait, I'm sorry. It's the equinox! Does this place mean anything to you? Hokani Falls? That's where Kenai gave me the amulet. You gotta go to Hokani Falls. And on the eve of the equinox, when the spirits change winter into spring, you must burn the amulet and send the bond back up to the ancestors! You know, you might wanna write some of this down. The equinox is only three days away. I have to get going. Uh, with the person who gave you the amulet. Kenai? But he's a bear. Yeah? You know, a bear? (GROWLS) Uh, I know what a bear is, and I suggest you go look in the woods. Well, even if I find him, how will I talk to him? Hmm. How will you talk to him? (GASPS) (GASPS) Don't be afraid. It's in there. (TRUMPETS LIKE ELEPHANT) That ain't it. Come on, try it again. (CHATTERS LIKE SQUIRREL) Ooh! I don't know what that was. One more time. (ROARS LIKE BEAR) (BIRDS SQUAWKING) KODA: And that mammoth stood there watching the whole thing. So I told Bucky, "The next time you have to sneeze, "please take the walnuts out of your mouth first." Oh, and then I started laughing so hard, guess what came out of my nose. Uh, Koda, speaking of food... I know what you mean. All this walking has made me crazy hungry. (SNIFFING) Ha-ha! Hey, watch it. (CHUCKLES) Hey! Whoa! All right, step aside, kid, and let a real bear show you how the digging's done. Sure it's easy now. I gave you a head start. (LAUGHS) Jackpot. All the roots you can eat, buddy. I knew I was onto something. Oh, yeah, you did, huh? Ah, what can I say? I've got killer instincts. Yeah, right. (SNIFFS) Oh, hey, look, is this a tuber? -Get down! -(GRUNTS) What is it? (SNIFFING) Quick, hide in here! (WHIMPERS) (BREATHING HEAVILY) (LOG CREAKING) (CREAKS) (ROARS) Aah! Ahh! Nita? Ow! (GRUNTS) Watch it! Hey, no, Nita! It's me, Kenai. Kenai? Is it really you? Yeah, it's really me. Wow, I'd heard you were a bear, I just didn't realize you'd look so much like a bear. Yeah, well, look at you. You really changed. Wait a minute. You can talk. I mean, you can understand me? Yeah. The spirits did it so when I found you, I could talk to you. Whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. You... You've been looking for me? Why? Well, this is why. You've kept this? After all these years. The great spirits told our shaman that this amulet bonds us as one. Really? So now you and I have to go to Hokani Falls... Together? Like when we were kids? -...and burn it. -And burn it! Burn it? What? It's no big deal. It's only a little trinket. Little trinket? Uh, well, what I mean is, we were just silly kids. They won't let me get married until it's destroyed. Hmm. Let me think about this. -Sorry, can't help you. -What? So, have fun burning the silly little trinket on your own. No, you don't understand. We have to burn it together. Otherwise, it won't work. KODA: What won't work? Uh, Nita, this is my brother, Koda. Koda, Nita. Nita, Koda. So you're Nita. Kenai was just dreaming about you. -(GIGGLES) -I was not. Was too. You should hear him. "Nita. Nita." Well, it's been nice talking to you, but Koda and I have big plans to go to Crowberry Ridge. Wait! You're just gonna walk away? You're not gonna help me take care of this? Nope. You know, neither of us can get on with our lives until we burn this amulet. I'll take my chances. Okay. Fine. Fine. I guess I'll just wait for them to turn you back into a human and send you to find me. Would they do that? No. No, buddy, of course not. Well, how do you know? What if they did turn you back into a man? (GASPS) Then we wouldn't be brothers anymore. No, Koda, it's... That's not... Hmm. (SIGHS) Fine. Okay. We'll go to Hokani Falls. But right after that, buddy, just the two of us, we'll race down to Crowberry Ridge. -Pinkie swear? -Pinkie swear. Then it's settled. Ready? (SIGHS) As I'll ever be. Um... Hokani Falls is this way. I knew that. I knew that. No, he didn't. Kenai has a lousy sense of direction. KENAI: That is not true. KODA: One time, in the middle of the night, he was trying to find our cave in the dark... Course, when we met, he didn't know the first thing about being a bear. Like this one time, we were hunting for pine nuts, and he stuck his big head inside a hollow tree. And I said, "You better not do that 'cause you don't know who lives there." But he did, 'cause you can't tell Kenai nothing. All right, Koda. Next thing you know, he spent a whole week smelling like a stinky skunk. (LAUGHS) Something tells me stinky skunk was an improvement. KODA: I got a lot more stinky Kenai stories, if you want to hear them. -Okay, so, like, we gotta go, eh. -We'll see you around, eh. -So, we'll give you a call. -Yeah, we'll catch you later. Yeah, we gotta go work out. Yeah. Gotta keep these muscles real buff, eh. So long! -Hey, look, it's big bear. -Beauty, eh. -Oh, hey, guys. -Boy, are we glad to see you, eh. Yeah, 'cause we finally found a couple of real moosettes, eh, right down there by the stream. BOTH: Bye! -Toodle-oo! -So long! Those guys are weird. Don't look. You'll only encourage them. But they won't give us the time of day, eh. We was thinking maybe you could help us with, you know, an opening line, like, "Oh, hey, I see you like to eat twigs." Or how about a sonnet, eh? Like, "Shall I compare thee to a summer's dew?" Oh, jeez. Forget that brainy stuff, eh. They're not owls. I like, "Hey ladies, nice dewlaps. Are those things real?" NITA: Excuse me. -Uh-oh. Oh, gee. -Hunter. Hunter! We're out of here! Bye! Every moose for himself. -Oh! -(BONES RATTLING) Act like we're not here. It's okay. This is Nita. She's with me and Kenai. -She is? -Oh. -Well, pleased to meet you, eh. -How's it going, eh? I'm Rutt, and this is my brother... NITA: Kenai, what's the holdup? We have to set up camp on that far peak before sundown. Oh, nice to meet you. Scary, isn't she? Let's go. We're running out of daylight. Nita, calm down. We got plenty of time. A smart traveler always allows for unexpected delays. (SIGHS) Well, this won't be a delay if you let me have a minute to give these guys a little romantic advice. (LAUGHS) Romantic advice? From you? Stop kidding. Let's go. (LAUGHS) Hmm. You know, boys, I think this calls for more than just a good opening line. TUKE: It does? Oh, yeah, yeah, of course. Ahem. Acts of bravery. That's what really impresses the ladies. RUTT: Gee, eh, bravery sounds scary. No, you just have to pretend to be brave. -Yeah? -I'll go out there, I'll act all ferocious, and then you guys come over the beaver dam and rescue them. Oh. Okay. Yeah, yeah. That's a beauty plan. -He's smart, eh. Not like you. -Oh, get out. Kenai, we don't have time for this. Kenai! It's no use. This falls under, "You can't tell Kenai nothing." (KENAI ROARING WEAKLY) What's wrong with him? Maybe he got ahold of some bad salmon. (SIGHS) This is stupid. (ROARING WEAKLY) This ought to impress the ladies for sure, eh. Yeah. I'm a big hungry bear, and I'm gonna rip you to shreds! Roar! I said I'm gonna rip you to shreds! (WHINES) Uh-oh. Hey, I think that's our cue, eh. -Yeah, beauty. -Let's go. Fear not, moosettes! I, Tuke, and my brother, Rutt, will save you, eh. -Yeah! -What ho, largish bear? Touch not those fair moosette ladies, eh. You's gonna have to go through us if you want them. Yeah. You'll have to kill us, eh. -What? No, no, not kill us. -Oh, sorry. Uh, maybe not kill us, but just, you know, push us down or something. Roar! (ROARS FIERCELY) (BOTH SCREAM) -(LAUGHS) -(GROANS) Jeez, that was scary, eh. Jeez. I thought I was gonna wet my hooves. You can go back to grazing. Nothing to see here. -Toodle-oo! -Hey, wait! Guys, where are you going? Don't leave. (BOTH GROWL) (GIGGLES NERVOUSLY) -(BLOWS STRIKING) -(KENAI EXCLAIMS PAINFULLY) (GRUNTING) (BOWLING RASPBERRY) (LAUGHS) -This used to be such a quiet river, eh. -Oh, yes. -Let's get out of here. -Nice rack on that little one, though. Are you kidding? All antler and no brain. That went well. -(GRUNTING) -(LAUGHS) Hey, Kenai. I thought you were supposed to be scaring moose. Do you think you can help me out here? Do all his plans end with his head stuck in something? Most of them. -KENAI: Koda! -Well, they do. Calm down, Kenai. We'll try to get you out of here. Okay, let's see here. KENAI: Aah! Ohh! Sure would be easier if he didn't have such a fat head. (GRUNTING) -Hi, Kenai. -Hi, Koda. Oh! Oh, no! My bag. My bag! The amulet's in my bag! It's floating right in front of you. Just grab it! -YOUNG KENAI: Nita! -(MUFFLED SCREAMS) You get it. I can't. I can't. It's right there! Kenai, get it. I'm a little busy here. It's getting away, Kenai! Help! Get it! Get it! KENAI: Stop hitting... (BOTH EXCLAIM) Oh, no! Oh! The amulet. Oh, there it is! I guess this would qualify as one of those unexpected delays. Ah, there it is. Oh, thank goodness. -(CACKLES) -(GASPS) Let's see what we got here. Hey! Wait, that's my stuff. Ooh! You leave that alone. It's mine. (CACKLES) Ugh! Come on! It's gone. Ohh! The amulet is gone. That's because there ain't a better thief than the masked bandit. Once they get something in their clutches, you might as well give up all hope. Nope, that amulet's as good as gone. The Ice Age will end before you get it back. Thanks a lot, Kenai. -What did I do? -This is all your fault! My fault? If you hadn't stopped to help those moose... Whoa, whoa! You're the one who destroyed an entire beaver dam. I wouldn't have destroyed it if you hadn't gotten your head stuck in it. And I'm not the one who had the bag in reach and then let it float away. My head was stuck. What's your excuse? (GRUNTS IN FRUSTRATION) Oh, what am I gonna do now? If I can't burn the amulet, I'll never be able to marry Atka. (SOBBING) (OWL HOOTING) (CHITTERING) (YAWNING) Kenai? Nita, Nita, you gotta come quick. You're not gonna believe it. Kenai spent the whole night untangling those tracks. And I didn't think anybody could, 'cause they were all forks, double-backs and crisscrosses and dead ends... Koda, Koda, where is Kenai? That's what I'm trying to tell you. He found the river bandit's hideout. (GASPS) Show me. (FOOTSTEPS) (SOFTLY) Nita, Nita, over here. Well, where is it? Did you get it? (WHISPERING) Shh! I don't have it yet. It's up in the tree. I'm waiting for them to fall asleep. (GRUNTS) -Nita, wait. -Hey! Nita, what are you doing? I'm getting my amulet back. Let me handle this. I'm fine. I've got it covered. No, seriously, you could fall. I'm trying to concentrate. -(BRANCH CRACKS) -NITA: Whoa! RACCOON: Hey, hey! Can't any of you morons define the term "nocturnal"? Anyone? Sorry. Sorry. It's completely my fault. Just me. (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) Uh, listen, you've got something of ours. Yeah, it's round, about so big. Maybe I do, maybe I don't. That's for me to know and for you to find out. Either way, it's a moot point. Finders keepers, losers weepers. It's the way of the woods. Hey, you didn't find it, you stole it. Thief. All right, you got me. That's what we do. We rob from the rich and give to the less fortunate. You know, like us. (RACCOONS CACKLING) I don't think you wanna mess with Kenai. He's a lean, mean, raccoon butt-kicking machine. (GROWLS) (LAUGHS NERVOUSLY) Ow! -Ahh! -Go ahead! Hit him with all you got. He can take it. Koda, what are you doing? I'm tricking them into using all their pine cones. Ow! It's a pine forest. Oh, right. This could take a while. You think? Whoa, whoa, hey, hey, what about a trade? Whoa, whoa! Hold your fire. Hold it. Hold, hold. He wants to trade. -RACCOONS: Ooh, a trade. -Whatcha got? (LAUGHS) What do I got? I got lots of things. I got pine cones? -(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY) -RACCOON: No! Uh, how about this stick? RACCOON: No. KENAI: Rock? -RACCOON: You are insulting me. -(GASPS) -(COOS) -RACCOON: I can't believe it! -Shoo. Shoo. Come on. (BLOWS) -(GIGGLING) Come on, let go. (SIGHS) (GASPS) (WHIMPERING) Ohh... Mama! NITA: Uh... Hi? Nita, I think it's time to go! (SCREAMING) Nita, behind you! (SCREAMING) Whoa! She's not bad. (GRUNTS AND SIGHS) (GASPS) I got an idea. Come on. Nita, go to the top. What? I'm trying to get down. Just listen to me! I know what I'm doing. Hello! I want what you took from me. Yes, that's it. Keep going! Let's get her. Kenai! (WHIMPERS) Well, well. Nowhere to run to, baby, nowhere to hide. Nita, let go! What? This is your plan? Just trust me. Don't listen to him. Come on, be a smart little hunter girl, huh? Hand over the trinket. Kenai, this better work! Catch me! (BOTH SCREAMING) (THUDS) (EAGLE SCREECHES) (BOTH LAUGH) -That was a lot of raccoons. -I can't believe I outran all of them. -When you jumped out of that tree... -Oh, oh! And the way you caught me! And then when we fell... BOTH: You were amazing! (BOTH SIGH) I'm just glad we finally got the old Nita back. What do you mean, "the old Nita"? The fun Nita. Come on, you know you've been kind of a stick in the mud this entire trip. Okay, maybe you don't know. It's just good to see you loosen up a bit, you know? Now hold on. Ew! What stinks? (SNIFFING) It's not me, Koda. Ugh! That's the most disgusting thing I've ever smelled. Let's go check it out. Hey! Wait a minute! I'm not finished. (GROANS) TUKE: Oh, brother, I have never known a moose to take this long, eh. RUTT: Don't rush me. I can't do it while you're watching. -Jeez. You're getting it on my leg. -Sorry. -Oh, hey, largish bear. -How's it going, eh? -Are we glad to see you. -Yeah, beauty. We're still getting the brush-off from those moosettes. Yeah, they seem immune to our rugged good looks, eh, so we thought we'd appeal to their olfactory senses. Ew! Yes, for example, I'm wearing essence of wet leaf compost -with just a hint of sandalwood. -Ugh! And I'm augmenting my natural moosely musk with a blend of pine needles and river mud. I got news for you, little brother. That wasn't mud. -Ugh! -RUTT: Gee, eh. -Kind of overpowering? -That's no good. Guys, don't sweat it. I got another plan. NITA: Oh, yeah. I think we've all seen your expertise on romance. Yeah, very funny. Don't we have an amulet to burn? Oh, we can spare a moment. -Beauty, eh. -What you need here... Excuse me. Is a woman's point of view. -Yeah? -And a plan that actually works. -That's beauty, eh. -(GROWLS) Hi! I'm playing with my two best friends, and I need a place to hide. Aw! Look at the sweet little thing. Jeez, I could just eat him up. Hello... -Psst. Go. Go. Get moving. -Beauty, eh. Good luck, eh. -Rutt, would you get going? -Okay. Oh, uh, excuse us, ladies. We're looking for our pal. -Um, brownish? -Why, yes. -Furry? -Yes, again. -About yay big? -That's him! Haven't seen him. Ha! Here I am. I fooled you. I win. -There's no beating you, little buddy. -Look at that. You're so good with him. Oh, yeah, eh. We have lots of little kid animal friends. We know a little weasel and a little badger. And we've even got some little baby bunny friends. Aw... (SOFTLY) Whoa. Smallish bear is like a babe magnet, eh. (STAMMERS) Socialize. So, would you ladies be interested in grazing on some twigs? Oh, no, thanks, we just ate. Ow! We love twigs. Really? Well, so do we. Right, little brother? Shall I compare thee to a summer's dew? Oh, jeez. Though it art more lovely and more dewy than you. TUKE: Oh, nice move, eh. MOOSETTE: What's wrong with him? Don't mind my little brother. He was trampled by an elk herd when he was a calf. Oh, jeez, that's awful. That's not true. It was only half a herd. MOOSETTE: You're serious, right? Smooth. Um, remind me again who's the better moose matchmaker. Beginner's luck. Jealous? All right, that was a really nice thing... Did you see me? I did it. You can do pretty amazing things with moose. That's great. Huh? Hey, wait for me! (GIGGLING) Oh, oh, Koda, be careful. Relax, he's fine. He's just looking for lunch. Yeah. Besides, I'm always careful. Ow! Oh, hey, we're making great time. Look, see, we just go down this trail until we hit the river. -River? -Yeah. And then we swim across. Swim? Then it's just a little ways to Hokani Falls. We'll be there by lunchtime tomorrow. Well, that's a good plan, but what about this? We go up this ridge to that mountain, climb up those cliffs, walk across that snow bridge and avoid the river altogether. That makes more sense to me. That doesn't make any sense. That's way out of the way, and there's too much up and not enough down. -I vote for the river. -Me too. Two-to-one. We win. Let's eat. -Well, it's my amulet. -So? And my wedding. Well, then have your honeymoon up there, 'cause if we go that way now, we'll have to walk all night to make it to the falls in time. Fine. Then I'll meet you there. Nita, what's wrong with you? Trust me. My way will get us there before... (SCREAMS) (PANTING) KODA: What's the matter with you? You act like you're afraid of fish. (LAUGHS) My gosh, Kenai, I can't believe it. Hey, Kenai, watch this. Where's the girl who's afraid of fish? Hi, my name is Nita, and I'm afraid of fish. I have a fish. The fish is so scary! Oh, no, he's gonna eat me! Ahem. Koda, come on. -Koda, stop. -No, he almost got me. Koda, stop! (SIGHS) We were just kidding around about the fish. No, it's not the fish. (SIGHS) It's the water. Ever since that day I fell through the ice when we were kids... Oh... I didn't realize. That's why I didn't grab the bag in the river. It wasn't your fault we lost the amulet. It was mine. Hey, we got it back together. That's all that matters, right? What are you looking at? You ready to keep going? But I'll never be able to cross that river. We can do that together, too. (FEELS LIKE HOME PLAYING) Funny how it turns out That everything can change What I feel right now is not the same as yesterday There's more than I imagined Deep inside my heart Emotions that I never knew And this is just the start So many things I've been missing not watching But that was all in the past Now I realize there's so much more to learn I'm ready for the world Not scared of letting go Now I realize there's so much more to feel And my heart knows it's real The part of me so long-forgotten Is calling, and this feels like home Home, home Feels just like home Feels just like home Right from the start, been friends forever Somehow we're meant to be together I feel like you've shown me how to find my way home Find my way home Now I realize so much more to learn I'm ready for the world Not scared of letting go Now I realize there's so much more to feel And my heart knows it's real The part of me so long-forgotten Is calling, and this feels like home Home, home Feels just like home It's the only way. Let me help you. I changed my mind. Nope, it's too late for that. We're going across. -Whatever happens, don't let go. -Okay. Now I realize there's so much more to learn I'm ready for the world Not scared of letting go Now I realize there's so much more to feel My heart knows it's real Part of me so long-forgotten Is calling, and this feels like home I did it! I did it! This feels like home Thank you, Kenai. Home, home Feels just like home (BOTH LAUGHING) Hey, smallish bear. So where's big bear, eh? With Nita. He never has time for me anymore. He's too busy helping her. Shee! Boy, do I know how you feel. My own brother gave me the heave-ho, eh, all for a babe. Actually, two really, really hot babes. Better watch your brother doesn't walk out on you, eh. He wouldn't do that. I said the same thing, eh, but get a load of Moose-anova over there. Shall I compare thee to a summer's dew? Did you just make that up? -Beauty, eh. -He's such a poet. (LAUGHTER) Yeah, I guess I'll see you around, little bear. (GRUNTS) (LAUGHTER) KENAI: You had a whole clumpful. NITA: Oh, you're making that up. All I know is I had all my fur when we went into the river, and two handfuls were missing when we came out. -Well, maybe you're just going bald. -What? You know, it does look really thin right through here. Yeah, very funny. This is the most fun I've had since we were kids. (CHUCKLES) Fun but cold. On a night like this, it's good to be a bear. I bet. (CHUCKLES) So, Hokani Falls. I guess we'll make it there in time, huh? I guess. A lot sure has changed since the last time we were there. No kidding. Do you ever miss being human? I mean, have you ever thought about changing back? Yeah, I've... I've thought about it. KODA: I knew it. Koda. You're going back with her. Koda, wait. Koda, wait! Koda! (ECHOING) Koda, answer me! (ECHOING) Koda! Hello? Koda? Are you in here? (GASPS) Where are you? Koda? (SNIFFLES) Koda? Go away. Koda, Kenai's worried sick about you. Come on, I'll take you to him. No! I said go away! Koda, please keep your voice down. It's not safe. I don't care. Just leave me alone. No, Nita! We're gonna be all right, but we've got to go. Now! (BOTH SCREAM) Run! Run! Run! Faster! We're gonna make it. -Nita! -Take my hand. (BOTH SCREAM) (BOTH GASP) Don't move. (GASPS) (NITA SCREAMS) Koda! Hang on! Nita! Don't let go! -Koda, hold on! -I am! (HEART BEATING) (DIGGING SOUNDS) Koda. (BREATHING HEAVILY) Koda, what would I have done if anything happened to you? You're gonna leave me. You said you missed being one of them. (SIGHS) (SNIFFLES) You're going back with her, aren't you? I do miss things, but you're my brother. I'll never leave you. Ah. Not ever. Ah, this show's giving me the munchies, eh. Hey, little brother, how about you get us some twigs, eh? (SOBS) Okay. Are you crying? No. I mean, well, yeah, but so what, eh? These lights are so beautiful, eh, I... (SNIFFLING) Oh, he's sensitive. A moose with depth? It's beauty, eh. What? He's a cute one, isn't he? Hey, I can be sensitive, too, eh. Ooh, I like your hooves. Really? Yeah, and I'm a hoof man. Yours are nice and shiny. (ALL GIGGLE) Hoof man? Why didn't I think of that? (SIGHS) (CHILDREN LAUGHING) Is this the equinox? Yeah, Koda, this is it. My mom is up there somewhere. My mom, too. Do you miss yours? Yes. But you don't need to wait for the lights to find her, Koda. She's always with you. In here. Once you love someone, they stay in your heart forever. It's time. Koda, you be good, okay? You're such a sweet little cub. -(GROANING) -(GASPS) Oh, the spell. (GROANS) Goodbye. (GROANING) (IT WILL BE ME PLAYING) If you hear a voice In the middle of the night Saying it'll be all right It will be me If you feel a hand Guiding you along When the path seems wrong It will be me There is no mountain That I can't climb For you, I'd swim through the rivers of time As you go your way and I go mine Our light will shine And it will be me It will be me It will be me Kenai, did you give Nita the amulet because you loved her? (SIGHS) It was a long time ago. But she's still with you in here. I can tell. Ah, Koda, it doesn't matter. Well, if you do love her, shouldn't you tell her? It's a little more complicated than that. Anyway, it's over. Hey, I promised you we'd be the first two bears to Crowberry Ridge. Pinkie swear, remember? How about first thing in the morning, we rustle up some more berries? Sound good? Mom, Kenai's so sad. It's all because of me. I'll be okay on my own. Tell the spirits to change Kenai back so he can be happy. (HOOFBEATS APPROACH) RUTT: Jeez, he's really out, eh. TUKE: Yeah. Maybe we should throw some water on his face. Why don't you just stand there drooling, eh? That should do it. Trample off. Oh, wait. Hey, I think I saw him move. Rise and shine, bear boy! Yeah, not time to hydroplane yet, eh. -It's hibernate, you hoofer. -That's what I said. Hey, we saw smallish bear last night. Yeah, we tried to stop him, eh, but he wouldn't listen to us. What? Where was he going? Uh... Oh. To get Nita, eh. He said he was gonna bring her back for you. Bring her back? No, no. If he steps foot in the village, the hunters will get him. BOTH: Oh, gee. WOMAN: Almost there. And now for the final touch, a beautiful bead necklace. Oh, no, you don't. Not this time. This is much more appropriate. Yeah, and that doesn't match anything she's wearing. And what makes you think those beads do? Nita, what would make you happy? (SIGHS) Once again, we are ready. Are you, my daughter? Yes, Father. I would expect a bride to be smiling on her wedding day. Is there something wrong? (SIGHS) Daddy, I'm so confused. I thought that when I burned the amulet, the bond would be broken, but in my heart, I... (SIGHS) I'm sorry, Daddy. I can't marry Atka. Nita... WOMAN: (SCREAMS) A bear! There's a bear in the village! It's a bear. Koda? Wait! Wait, don't hurt him. No, our fish! I got him! We've got him now! -Look, he's up in the tree! -There he is. Get him! Don't! Don't! Please stop! (WOMAN SCREAMS) (ROARS) Look out, here he comes! (ROARS) -Get your spears! -Come on! -Let's go after him. -Atka, no! -Leave him alone. -Get him! Oh, no. Run! MAN: This way. After them! Nita, are you hurt? I have to stop them. There he is! Let's get him! (GROWLS) Follow me! Rock! Look out! Get out of the way! Stay low. Kenai! (GRUNTS) (GASPS) Hmm... There you are. Got you! (HUNTERS LAUGHING) (MOOSE BELLOWS) (MEN SCREAM) Nice move, eh. -(BOTH GRUNT) -Gee, eh. BOTH: Oh! Our heroes. (MEN GROAN) Beauty, eh. Come on! We have to find Kenai. (GROWLS) -Aah! -(ROARS) Kenai! No, don't! (GASPS) (GROANS) (ECHOING) Kenai! (PANTING) (SIZZLES) NITA: How could you? -What? -He was my friend. (MOANS) Kenai? (GROANING) (GROANING) I can't... I don't understand. I'm sorry. I love you, too. The spirits? Kenai, I can understand you. I asked the spirits to turn you back into a man. -What? -So you could be with Nita. No, Koda. It's okay. I just want you to be happy again. Nita, I can't. But I can. Am I the only one that hears these bears speaking? -Yeah, that's beauty, eh. -How's it going, eh? Father. Is this what you want? Will this make you happy? You are my daughter and I will love you no matter what you choose. (TRUMPETS) (SCREECHES) (GROANS) (MOANS) Nita? (MOANING) How do I look? Like a bear, except they gave you antlers. What? Gotcha! (ALL LAUGHING) Life is simple and clear When you make the right choice It's truth that you hear When you find your own voice Oh, my brothers and sisters, believe You are just what you are meant to be Oh, great spirits Hear my voice today -I love happy endings, eh. -I love happy endings, too.
