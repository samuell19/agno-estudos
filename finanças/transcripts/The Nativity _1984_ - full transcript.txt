In the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth. And God separated the light from the darkness and the water from the Earth. And then He said, let us make man in our own image and likeness. Then God formed a man from the dust of the Earth and he put him in the Garden of Eden to cultivate it and care for it. The Lord our God banished Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden so he would work the ground from which he had been taken. God the Father sent his own son Jesus to save us and forgive us. This is the true story of Jesus and his teaching. And this is the Holy Land where all these events took place, 2000 years ago. Hail, Mary. The Lord is with you. Blessed are you among women. Mary, be not afraid. You have found favor with God. You will have a son. I am the Lord's servant. Let it be done according to your word. I, Quirinius, Governor of Syria, proclaim to you, the subjects of Caesar Augustus, through this edict dated in Rome in the 750th year of its foundation, that it is the will of your Emperor that a Census should be taken in this province. Joseph took Mary, who was expecting a child, and went from Nazareth to Bethlehem, where Joseph was born, to register for the census. At the same time that Mary and Joseph were traveling toward Bethlehem, three wise men from the East, Melchior, Gaspar, and Balthazar, guided by a star, were also approaching the birthplace of Jesus the Savior. They were looking for the King of Kings to do him homage. They would not have long to wait. When they arrived at the gates of Jerusalem, Herod the King learned of their visit and invited them to his palace to learn of their mission. Welcome to my kingdom, wise men. Your visit is greatly appreciated. We are surprised that we did not receive news of your arrival so that we might honor you with a proper welcome. Do not be alarmed that your servants did not learn of our arrival. By day, we may be invisible to the human eye. We have heard of your knowledge. Whatever may be the reason for your visits, you are welcome. We have come to worship the King of Kings. May you rest well and accept our hospitality on the condition that you return and report to us on the success of your mission. Inn Keeper, ahh, Inn Keeper. I hope you're not wanting lodging here; we're all filled up since yesterday. Don't you worry, Mary. I'm tired. What is it? Ephraim, don't you recognize me? I'm Joseph. We need some place to rest. May God bless you. Even if my father came, I couldn't squeeze him in. I'm very sorry, Joseph. Goodbye. But, Ephraim! Ah! We'll find another place, Joseph. Yes. Joseph, look there. That doesn't look so bad. No, No. It wouldn't be right. I'm tired, Joseph. Go in and look. Yes, Mary. Today, a Savior has been born to you. He is Christ the Lord. You will find a baby wrapped in clothes lying in a manger. And so Jesus came in a cave in a manger. In a most humble of places the child, Christ, was born. And from all around the community, the people came to visit him. The three wise men also came to pay homage to the King of Kings. And they brought him offerings from the distant lands from which they came. Their journey had not been in vain. Gold, Lord, for you are King. Myrrh, a symbol of good health, Lord, because you're man. Incense, Lord, because you are God. Go on, Joseph Wait, my dear Lord. I've grown old waiting. Waiting in this temple for the arrival of the Savior. The Holy Spirit promised me that my tired eyes wouldn't look on the face of death until I had the joy of looking at the face of Christ. Mary, a sword will pierce your soul, and the thoughts of many hearts will be revealed. Mary, I am Anna, a Prophetess, daughter of Phaniel, of the Tribe of ASHETH. I say to you, Mary, that the blessings of all generations will be upon you, because to you has been born the Savior that you carry in your arms. I have good news, Mary. I have work. The Lord answered our prayers. Yes. The Messiah will be born in Bethlehem? According to the Prophet, Michael, yes, sire. Has he already been born? There have been some rumors during the last two years, but nothing for sure, sire. How is that you, the wisest, and the most learned priests from the temple could not discover if the Messiah has yet been born? Peace be with you, Herod. Call Votegis. The King wants to see you at once. Yes, your highness. Greetings, Herod. Come, Votegis. A Roman Garrison must proceed immediately to Bethlehem. Oh, so nearby. Yes, I'm having some problems in that town. Once the Garrison is there, I'll send new instructions. It shall be done. Oh, Joseph, where is the child? I don't know. I thought he had gone to the fountain with you. You look frightened, what's wrong, Mary? Roman Soldiers are all over the town. In Bethlehem? Yes. What's the meaning of all this Joseph? What's going on? I'm afraid. Ah, yeah, I'm getting old. I, I should be earning more for you and the child. I guess I'm getting old and now this. Look, there he is. Jesus, where were you? I went to see the soldiers. Please, son, don't stray away from the house. Play all you want, but around here where, where we can watch you. Take this down. These are the royal orders, All male children under three years that live or were born in Bethlehem shall be put to death. I'm off to my watch, Centurion. Herod has finally sent orders. Where and whom do we fight? This is not fighting. The soldiers of Rome have a less pleasant task at hand. We're soldiers and we must obey. This command is only worthy of barbarians, and there is hardly time to consult with the Syrian Council. It's that serious? Read it. So, we must put to death all the male children in Bethlehem? Yes, all. That's good! So then we would be killing all of the future enemies of Rome. But there is one that interests me. He's offering a prize for the one that kills the most. I need no prize to do my duty. Now, we're going. I never expected that Herod would give a feast for the people. It is true that today is the birthday of his son Archelaus. We all love our children, Joseph. Even Kings. Have a good time, son. Why don't you come? Only children and mothers are invited. Ready, now. Forward! Ready, now. Forward! Joseph of Nazareth, you must take the child and Mary and cross the desert into Egypt. They are in great danger here. The child and you are in great danger. Come on, hurry! Where are we going? To Egypt. What about our things? We must leave them. There is no time. To escape persecution, the Holy Family fled to Egypt, where they stayed until the death of Herod. And so was fulfilled the prophecy: "I called my son out of Egypt". It's just work, like any other work. You must have it ready for next Monday. If you don't make it, somebody else will. Joseph, you need the money. The man to be crucified is a criminal. Think about it. Amrath, I make beds where the people rest after a hard day, tables to break bread with friends, plows to prepare the soil for planting, caskets to return the dead to the good earth, cradles for newborns. I do not want to and I cannot make instruments of torture. In your place, I would do the same. Thank you, Amrath. And may the good Lord go with you always. May your God protect you. Joseph, you look worried, and tired. Well, I have things on my mind about our future. Now suppose we packed up our things and left Egypt. Just where would we go? Back home, Joseph. It was there that Herod ordered that massacre to eliminate the child. What are the consequences if we go back there? Who knows, they might still look for the child. The Lord is kind. He'll protect us. We must pray for direction and inspiration so that we may do the Lord's will. You're always right. Come along. We'll wait and see. I will ask the Lord what is in store for us. And Mary, Joseph, and the child, Jesus, fulfilled the Lord's Prophecy, and returned from Egypt to Nazareth in Galilee. From time to time Joseph went to the sea of Galilee to repair the fishermen's boats. And he took little Jesus to enjoy playing on the beach with his dog. At the end of the services, we'll meet here. Don't be late, now. Does she go alone? Yes, because she's going to that part of the temple where only women are allowed. But you two will come with me to another place. The one set aside for the men. You see, you're not children any longer. Come on. Come on, Jesus, don't stay behind. Why, father? We must get in line for the sacrifice. The book says when you enter the house of the Lord, be careful, and come more to listen than to offer the sacrifice of the foolish. The observations of this boy are really surprising. Especially when he's so young. Not only that, but he comes from Galilee. The Lord in all His wisdom made us Galileans, and we thank Him for it. Besides, what reasons do you have for being surprised? Oh, no? You Galileans are the dumbest people. Every year you come just to be mistreated. Don't you learn? But on the other hand, we're kind to the strangers that go there. Galilee, ha ha. Only a fool would go to Galilee. Ha ha ha ha ha. Who are you provoking? An old man and a child? A weak man that provokes is a fool, but a strong man that provokes is a fool and a coward. We must arrive at the knowledge of truth. The order the knowledge of the Torah....... A moment, one moment; listen to me my friends. We must follow the rules and not speak at the same time. What were you doing in there? That's where they teach the scriptures. Come. We must get to Nazareth before dark. Joseph, didn't you offer the sacrifice? Ah, oh Lord, I'll do it. No, father, Let me have it. Why, he let it go. Calm yourself, Joseph. He already knows so much more than we do. Come on, Jesus, your parents are way ahead. It is most important that in these hard times, all around us we set an example so that we can guide our people to a more harmonious life. It is clear that all the virtues are important. Protect our tradition, the wisdom of the Torah, and observance of the commandments of the scriptures. Wisdom, Justice, and Prudence. Who are you? I have a question. Is it proper to ask the son who he is in his father's house? REMOVE him from the temple! No, let's have a little fun with him. If this is your father's house, it follows that he must be very rich and powerful. So He is, and this house is not worthy of Him. Not worthy of him? This magnificent building with lofty ceilings? God gave the sky to man for the ceiling of his house. Do you think it's much that what you offer God? Do you think it's little what you receive from Him? We laugh at you little teacher. In turn, the one who is lost can't at the same time mock others. Mockery is the mask of incapacity and impotence. Why does no one ridicule the powerful in his presence? Mockery is cruel, and it is cowardly. Do not mock. The child is amazing; why what he is saying... Thank you, sir, for praising God. He who sees merit shares it. That's what I said. How could you know? You couldn't have heard it! How did you come by your learning? Answer your question, since you are a wise man. Isn't your mission to instruct the people? Yes. Teach me. Have you seen Jesus? No, I haven't. Have you seen Jesus? No, Joseph. Have you seen Jesus? We haven't seen him. I checked the caravan. No one has seen him. What should I do? Be calm, Mary, we'll wait here. He knows where the camp is. No, Joseph. No, Joseph. Let's go look for him in Jerusalem. Just as you say. Inn keeper! Inn keeper! Don't worry, Mary. He must be here. When he starts thinking his thoughts, he forgets everything. I'm so worried. You want a room? Don't you remember me? I'm Joseph of Nazareth. Ah, I thought you were on your way home. Our son, Jesus, must be here. I haven't seen him. If you want to look, go right in. And the greatest attribute God has bestowed on man is wisdom. And a wise man is prudent; therefore, the greatest virtue is prudence. Courage is the greatest virtue. We all know courage is not a virtue. What is the opposite of virtue? Have you seen a boy about this height in a white tunic? No. Ahh! I'm looking for a boy in a white tunic. No, no. Haven't seen him. No, Nothing. John, anything? My God! Mary, Mary...Mary. At this time of night, the temple is always empty. Go and look! Alright, as you say. Does any virtue exist without courage? Besides, cowardice is mother to all vices. Fear of work engenders idleness and laziness. Fear of temperance pushes man to drunkenness and gluttony. Vice and sin are only fear; fear and cowardice. Then you...you insist that courage is the greatest virtue? It is. And fear gives rise to all vices? It does. So, then the fear of God, because it is fear, engenders vices. How do you explain that? Do the commandments of God order us to do good or evil? Good, naturally. Then, he who does good obeys our Lord. Yes. And he who does evil, disobeys our Lord. Truly. Who should fear God? He who obeys, or who disobeys? He who disobeys, of course. Therefore, the fear of God is the fear of disobeying God. That is to say, of doing evil. Courage is strength. Fear is weakness. Remember our great prophets. All of them have been very different. Moses, Joshua, Isaiah, David, Solomon, Elijah. Were they or were they not, courageous men? My son. How could you have forgotten about us? Why, mother? Don't you know that I must tend to my Father's business? Come here, John. Lord, I am not worthy to receive your baptism, yet you come to me. We must do this to fulfill the Law. Rise, John the Baptist. So be it. It was at this time that Jesus came from Nazareth and Galilee and was Baptized in the Jordan by John. Lord, receive the baptism of water. You, who will give us the Baptism of the HOLY SPIRIT. You are my beloved son. On you my favor rests. Afterward, the Spirit drove him out into the wilderness. And there he fasted for forty days and forty nights. And there He was tempted by Satan. St. Mark, Chapter 1, Verse 13 : He wanted to be a man to know a man's weakness, and to experience the human condition. Suffering hunger and thirst. Embraced by the burning sun during the day, and then trembling from the cold during the night, and open to the merciless sand storm. Weak man, emaciated and hungry, if you are the son of God, turn these stones into bread. Man does not live by bread alone. But by every word that comes from God. Man, weak creature. All the kingdoms of the world I will give you if only you kneel down before me and worship me. Be gone now Satan. For it is written, worship the Lord your God and serve Him only. Those who have two changes of clothing, give one to the less fortunate. And those who have sufficient food do the same. There is the criminal. Detain him. What do you want to know? Was it you who spoke against Herod? I said he has done wrong. His fault is in his wrong doing and mine in my own words. Then you admit it. Therefore, you must come with us now. If you wish. My mission is accomplished. Anything we can do for you master? Just wait. We must wait with faith the return of the Lord. Is it true that you have been trying to incite the people against me? No, not against you nor against any other kingdom of this Earth. Then I think the time you served in jail is enough. You may go now. But stay away from Galilee. If you dare to return, my soldiers will kill you. Are you so much afraid of my words? Who are you? They said a Prophet. More like a man possessed. I don't want any problems with the government in Rome. With the Divine Tiberius. I want peace and quiet. If that's what you want, set a good example. What do you mean? That woman you live with, Erodius, is a sinner like you. She's the wife of your brother. You lie. She's my wife now. It is not lawful for you to have her. And Galilee should not be governed by adulterers. Take him to prison! Kill him! Andrew, Simon, sons of Jonah, follow me. I'm not worthy. I have sinned much. Be not afraid. Follow me. Father, here comes the preacher that is spreading the word of the Lord. May peace be with you. And with you, too. John, James, sons of Zebedee. Follow me. May I, father? You may, son. And I, Father? You may also go, my son. There he is. I see you are an honest man. Where do you know me from, Galilean? I just saw you when you were under a tree resting from the heat. Lord, you are indeed the Son of God. Do you believe because I told you that I saw you under that tree? Greater things you'll see. Follow me. You're next. Isaac, son of Abraham, three dinars. Levi, from now on you shall be called Matthew. Follow me. Greetings Jesus, I am Judas. Judas Iscariot. I'd like to join you. It all falls in place now. Come, follow me, Judas Iscariot. My dear Lady, even though your son has touched no wine he looks very pleased. God loves the joy. There's no more wine! What are we going to do? Without wine, the festivities will be over. Ah, I don't know what I'm going to do! What a disaster for the host. What a disaster! Sirs, we need more wine and there isn't any. How? We thought there would be plenty. With the heat and with the dance.... Son, son. They have no more wine. Mother, why do you involve me? My time has not come yet. Do something, quick! Do what my son asks. Fill those containers with water. They're always filled with water for the purification. Give me a scripture. Which one, sir? Any one. Isaias. The spirit of the Lord is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the good news to the unfortunate, to heal those with a broken heart, to release the prisoners, give sight to the blind, and relieve all those oppressed; to proclaim to all, the year of the Lord's favor and the day of retribution. The scriptures of the Prophet Isaiah are fulfilled. He's possessed by the devil. I will help him. Be quiet. Come out of this man. Thank you...Thank...thank you. Thank you. Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean. I am willing. Be clean. Thank you, Lord. Repent! Have pity, have pity on this poor blind man. Please, have pity. Have pity. Lord, I'm blind, but I hear your steps. You are the son of God. Give me sight. Let the light enter into my eyes. Your faith has saved you. Wash your eyes. I can say truly you are the light of the world. I see! I see! I see! Look, he has cured the blind man on the Sabbath. Jesus of Nazareth, you blaspheme. Blaspheme? Yes. You have healed the blind man on the Sabbath. What man here among you would not rescue a sheep that had fallen into a pit on the Sabbath? How much more valuable is a man than a sheep? Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath. Ask me for anything you want. Under oath, I will give you all you want up to half my kingdom. Ask him for the head of John the Baptist on a platter. Yes, his head. Remember, you have promised it under oath. So be it. Bring the head of the Baptist. Lord, it always fills me with sadness to see a young man die. Today I have also known great sorrow. Rabbi, my son has died. The only son the Lord gave me. Why didn't the Lord take me instead? Calm yourself. Calm. Bring him down. Don't cry. Young man, I say to you, arise! Thank you Lord. What is impossible for any man to do it is possible for God. Be quiet! Rabbi, the husband of this woman found her committing adultery. Moses would have said take her to the nearest quarry and stone her to death. Wait! Now what do you say? Answer Rabbi. Or you don't want us to follow the law of Moses? He who is without sin, let him throw the first stone. Woman, where are your accusers now? They condemned you? No one Lord. Neither do I condemn you. Go now and sin no more. Truly, I say unto you that the Heavens will open and the angels of the Father will slowly descend to the son of man. Master, I will follow you to the end of the world. Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head. Rabbi, my father suffers from old age and is soon to die. Lord please permit me to return home for his burial. All of you follow me. And let the dead bury their dead. Good Master. What should an old man do to achieve Eternal Life? Do you know the commandments? Yes, Master. I've obeyed them since I was young. Only one thing left to do. Sell all your goods and give the money to the poor. That will assure you of all the riches in heaven. Oh, how difficult it is for the affluent to gain entrance into the kingdom of heaven. It would be easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for someone rich to enter the eternal kingdom. We, on the other hand have renounced everything to follow you faithfully, good Master. I assure you that there is no one who has given up home, or brothers, or sisters, or children, or worldly goods for the love of me and of my Father, who will not receive in this age, a hundred times as much, and in the age to come, everlasting life. Many who think themselves first shall come last. And those that stand last shall come first. Master, this place is far from town. Why not tell them to go now to buy something to eat? They need not go. You yourselves will give them to eat. Master, 200 dinars worth of bread wouldn't make a dent in their appetites. Believe me. Master, we're down to five loaves of bread and two fishes. How can we feed that many with this? Sit down, we're going to feed you....................... Bring the baskets ... Ask and it shall be given you. Seek and ye shall find. Knock and the door will be opened. For everyone who asks receives, he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks, the door will be opened. Why do you look at the splinter in your brother's eye, and pay no attention to the plank in your own? Which of you, if his son asks for bread, will give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish will give him a snake. If you then, though you're evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your father in Heaven give good gifts to those who ask him? Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven. Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the Earth. Blessed are those who weep, for they shall be consoled. Blessed are those who thirst and hunger for justice, for they shall be satisfied. Blessed are the merciful, for they shall receive mercy. Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God. Blessed are the peaceful. And blessed are those who are oppressed and persecuted for theirs shall be the Kingdom of Heaven. Jesus, Master. Lord, if you had come sooner, my brother would have not died. Your brother will rise again. I know he will rise again in the last day. I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in me, though dead, shall live. Where have you placed him? Lord, if you permit me to get up, I will show you. Lazarus, Come forth. Father, thank you for having heard me. He was buried four whole days. Here. Go now. He says he's the King of Israel. If the people follow him, we're lost. Somehow we must avert the people's attention... ...saying that because of him Rome will destroy our city. Out! Out! All of you get out! Out! Out! Out! It is written: My Father's house is a house of prayer. Why have you driven the people out of the temple? And who has given you authority to do this? I, too, would like to ask a question. John's baptism; Was it the work of Heaven or of man? Oh, no. You won't catch us with your words again. If we answer by saying of heaven...you'd find fault for not believing in Him. And if we answer a man, all of the people would stone us for John was a great Prophet. You didn't answer. Therefore, I won't answer either on what authority I do these things. Master, are we obliged to pay tribute to Caesar? Oh, no! Let me have a coin. Whose image do you see in this coin? Caesar. Then give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar. And to God what is God's. Do not burden yourselves. Don't carry coins, silver, or gold in your pockets. And travel lightly on the road. Master, come to my house. My daughter is dying. Save her master. Master, master. Your daughter has just died. No, No, No. They're preparing her body. If you have faith, she will live. Take me. Do not weep. She's not dead, she sleeps. My daughter, my daughter, my daughter! You have heard it said, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, but I say instead, if anyone slaps your right cheek, turn to him the left one. And you have heard it said, love your neighbor, but I tell you, love all your enemies. Do good to those who despise you, do not despise them in turn. And do not pay heed to the hypocrites who make only false promises so that they have power over you. Before following those false prophets, examine their deeds. A tree is known by its fruit. A bramble bush cannot bear grapes or figs. Beware of those who proclaim justice to attract attention, and of those who boast of their charity so that men will honor them. And don't amass treasures. Grain stored can be consumed by worms and other vermin. Stored gold is an invitation to thieves. No one can serve two masters. You cannot serve at the same time God and the money. And observe this rule : Everything that you wish to be done unto you, do it yourselves unto others. Those who have heard my words are like the man who builds his house on a solid rock. Don't disturb the Master! Wait! Wait! Let the children come to me. Because theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven. A wealthy man had two sons. The youngest one told his father, "I would like to have my inheritance without delay." The father agreed to it. The young man gathered all that his father gave him and journeyed to a far distant foreign land and there he spent all that he had. Silence! What kind of behavior is this in the temple? Children, out! Get out! With what right do you do this? With the same as these innocents. What? You cannot understand it. Why? Because you are all hypocrites. He has called us hypocrites? Yes, whited sepulchers. We must act now and quickly. He is surely planning to stay in Jerusalem. For Passover. That gives us just enough time. One new commandment I give you: to you love one another. Don't you think we love one another, Lord? In truth, In truth I tell you... ...that one of you will betray me. One of us? Impossible. Lord? Who is it? The one who understands my words. What you intend on doing, you must do promptly. Twenty six, twenty seven..... I was a fool. I thought he'd be the greatest of Kings. ....And thirty. I am not to be among you much longer, but a short time thereafter, you shall see me again. Where are you going, Master? I am going to a place where you cannot follow, but later on, you shall. Why can't I go? I'd give my life for you. Three times you shall deny me before the cock crows. I'll never. There has been a quarrel amongst you about who is the most important. But truly, truly I say to you that the meekest and the humblest shall be first in the Kingdom of Heaven. My Father loves humility and in testimony, I, his son, will wash your feet. Master, you wash my feet? You won't be able to understand it now. I won't ever. Please, don't insist on it. If you don't let me do it, you're no disciple of mine. Take, and eat. This is my body and this is my blood of the new covenant which is to be poured out for the forgiveness of sins. Peter. John. A great sorrow overwhelms my heart. Await. Keep vigil with me. Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass me by. But let your will be done, not mine. Peter, John, James, wake up. Yes, this is the hour. The son of man is about to be handed over to sinners. Get up. Come. My betrayer is close at hand. The one I greet with a kiss, that is JESUS. Oh, Judas, with a kiss you betray the son of man? You have come well-armed with sticks and swords as against a thief. We have been together every day at the temple and you never arrested me. This is your hour. This is the reign of darkness. Take him to Pontius Pilate. Bring the accused. What are the charges against him? He has been preaching subversion throughout our nation. He has refused to pay tribute to Caesar, and he insists that he is Christ the King. Are you the King of the Jews? You have said it. He is an impostor. He dares to deny our Prophet Moses. I find no crime or fault in this man. He deserves to die! If you have judged him, why bring him to me? You know our Laws forbid killing. So that's it. So now you are willing to accept the Law of Rome. We have always accepted it. But Rome has not been offended. From Galilee throughout Judea, his doctrine subverts the people. A Galilean? Yes, that godforsaken place. I understand that Herod, the tetrarch of Galilee, is coming to Jerusalem for Passover. He shall hear and judge this man. Take him away. Pilate has made a wise decision. This man should be judged by me. Then you decree his death? No, of course not. I wanted to make sure that he wasn't the Baptist, returned. But he isn't. No cause to worry. He won't trouble you. Hmm...He'll come with me to Galilee. I will keep him at court and he'll perform miracles. He can't perform miracles. He's an impostor. No, he's a magician! A magician. You think I haven't heard about him? Why would he do your bidding? Fear of death. I'd stop at nothing. You! Turn this water into wine... ...so you won't obey my command, huh? Will you condemn him to death? Not during Passover. If you're in a hurry, go to Pilate. This man has been accused of talking and inciting against the power of ROME, and yet when I interrogated him in your own presence, his answers proved him innocent of your accusation. Not even Herod has found him guilty; otherwise he would have sentenced him to death. Therefore, after the whip, he'll go free. Whip him. Greetings my friends, greet the King of the Jews. Sit on your throne! This is the man. The King of the Jews. I consider this sufficient punishment for the crimes you claim he has committed. He is free. Bring Barabbas! You well know that during the festivities of Passover, in a magnanimous gesture, Rome releases one of your people. Which one? You can choose between this criminal or this man. Who shall go free? Barabbas or Jesus called the Christ? What shall I do with JESUS? What wrong has he done? I am totally innocent of this just man's blood! Pick up the cross. Hurry! Lift it. Let go of me. Let go of me! Let me go to him. All of us. All of us If He doesn't want to be free, what can we do? Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me. Weep for yourselves and for your children. Blessed are the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never nursed. Lord, you who reurrected my daughter, why don't you save yourself? Now he is crucified! It is your fault... ...that I have committed the worst injustice in all history. What you say is not important to us. Father, forgive them for they know not what they do. I am thirsty. If you are Christ, save yourself from all this. And us, too. Have you no fear of God? Even being under the same judgment, we both deserve punishment after all, we are criminals and we must pay for all our terrible crimes. He has done no wrong. Lord, remember me when you enter the kindom of your father. I say to you that this day you will be with me in paradise. Woman, there is your son. John there is your mother. It is finished. Father, into your hands I commend my spirit. And the angel answered and said unto the women: Fear ye not, for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified. He is not here. For He has risen as He said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay and go quickly and tell the disciples that He has risen from the dead. And, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee. There ye shall see him. Lo, I have told you. Simon Peter, Cephas, do you love me? Lord, this is the third time you've asked me. You know everything. You know that I love you. Feed and tend my lands. For I say you are rock. And on this rock I shall build my church. And the gates of hell shall not prevail against her. And you shall have the keys to the Kingdom of Heaven. And all that you bind on this Earth, shall be bound in Heaven. And all that you loose on this Earth shall be loosed also in Heaven. You will not see me for a while. Then you will see me always. Pray as I have taught you. Our father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy Kingdom come. Thy will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil. AMEN
