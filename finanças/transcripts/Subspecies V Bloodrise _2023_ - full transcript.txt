Out of the dark ages, a child was born. Offspring of the vampire Vladislas. and immortal Circe The oracle foretold that he would one day slay his father. The remedy was to dismember him and scatter the pieces upon the Black Sea. A curse upon thee. You cannot destroy me. Crusaders stole the cursed child and the demon-slaying dagger. They delivered the child to a fortress of the church. The brothers cut off its fingertips, clipped its ears, massaged its faced with potions until monstrous features could pass for human. He was trained in the arts of war, sworn into a secret sect, Knights of the Dragon, Slayers of the Ancient Ones. The creature grew to manhood, hero of the great Crusades. Decades he rode the continent, slaying demons, laying waste to pagan temples. With no memory of his birthright until the day his destiny delivered him to the castle of his father. Prince Vladislas. We have come for the bloodstone. The bloodstone was a gift to me. We have come for the bloodstone. What is your name, crusader? Radu, the Fearless. This is not our day of reckoning. It is here. Let us slay these creatures and let's be gone. Stay your hand. Listen to me. Who is your father? God is my father. Your family name. The church is my family. You are stolen child. The lost one. Vladislas is your father. All that is his can be yours. - No. - Don't listen to her. She's a demon. Silence. Blood of my blood. I'm your mother. No. You're an abomination. Crusaders stole you from me to fulfill the prophecy. What prophecy? That one day you will slay your father. Is that true, Marius? The patriarchs do not share their secrets with lowly monks, sir. Heed my warning. Kill him and you will be cursed into eternity. In time you will understand. Patience is a virtue, to immortals such as we. Brave. Don't listen to the lies of demons. She spoke the truth, Marius. The patriarchs should counsel you on questions of your lineage. For now we have the bloodstone. Our brothers did not die in vain. Make with the holy water. In the name of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, I purge this house of evil. Radu, wait for me. Hey Radu, don't leave me here. There's life in this castle. Vladislas and his consort. No, they're far away by now. Sir, I beg you. Spare my child. Please. Please, please, sir, I bet you, I beg you. All must die, Radu. Do your duty and purge this house. These are innocents. It's our duty to rescue them. Come closer. I won't hurt you. No! No. Take my child from this cursed place, please. No mother, I'll stay with you. Kill these wretched creatures, Radu. Silence, Marius. What's your name? Helena. Vladislas stole me from my father's house. He ravaged me for pleasure, but I swear he did not drink my blood. Stephan is the child of our shameful union. Vladislas waits Stephan to grow to manhood, to taint him with the blood of Nosferatu. Please. I'll deliver you from this ungodly place. My savior. Are you mad, Radu? She's the vampires consort. She's the spawn. Step aside, I'll kill them myself if I have to. There's been enough slaughter here. Come here, brother. Come to me. Come here. Let me see. We are duty-bound to kill them. Radu. The child is innocent. We do not choose our father. Follow me. Where are you taking us? To A wonderful city. The city of God and light. God forsakes us, Radu. They've taken the horses. We must be gone from this place. Rest here, little brother. You rest easy. I'll watch over you. We'll shelter here for the night. It's not safe for traveling, in the sunlight. Our lives are in your hands. I'm a servant of God. You're my Lord and savior. Here's a place you can rest. Thank you. Ah, my eyes. My eyes, my eyes. Hey. Hey. You lived your whole life in darkness. It'll take time for your body to adjust to the sun. Don't worry, there's nothing to fear. The sun is the most powerful being in the heavens, the source of all life. God is the most powerful being in all creation and the source of all life. Don't bore the boy with dogma. Kneel by the rocks and pray for salvation, boy. Do as he says. This is madness, Radu. I understand you're pity for the boy but you have to destroy the mother. You saw when I examined her. She's unbitten. I will not take part in this. Release me for my service. What, I can't do that. You're my conscience. You're my only friend. I had my fill of the church's dark work, but you my friend are flirting with disaster. You know I will do whatever is necessary. You know that. I'm sorry Radu, but I must go. So be it. Go with good fortune. Marius? I hope our paths will cross again. Me too, brother. But I fear they will not. May God protect you. Where is brother Marius going? To see his fortune. Why does he talk of killing my mother? He believes her blood is tainted by Vladislas. Helena, it's time to go. No, I cannot. Go without me. Sure you can. She awoke with the sunset. She too had lived in darkness and would need time to adjust to the light. I wanted to believe in her humanity. But I could not shake my fear that God had forsaken us. You are my guardian angel, Radu. You fear me. I am human. I swear to you. How can I prove myself? You are spawn of Vladislas. Have mercy on me. No, that's my mother. I'll kill you. Lay down your sword, brother, and I'll lay down mine. Go back to sleep. It's okay. By some miracle, I am still human. In time, your humanity will fade. To save the blood of the saints brings peace to the fallen souls. Drink. If it relieves your suffering. There was no turning back, no miracle to save us. She slept in the shadows, leaving me to grow closer to the Stephan. Is she gonna die? Some would say she is already dead. She's a vampire like my father. She is becoming one. Will you slay her? Not today. Someday perhaps. With your sword, you can make it quick and painless. Death is never painless. Someone must slay her. I'll pray it will be. We traveled by night. Pilgrims on an unholy quest. I let her suckle freely from the bloodstone. For that there would surely come a reckoning. How does it feel to drink the blood of the saints? It feels like miracles. The knowledge and power and mercy. You are curious? I was taught to resist temptation. The bloodstone was your father's. It is your birthright. Drink, Radu. No one will know, but you and I. Drink. Drink. You must never leave me, Radu. You are my guardian, my love, my savior until eternity. Forgive me, Radu. You have desecrated my castle, my consort, and my child. The bloodstone, Helena, and the boy belong to me. No. Leave my mother alone. Take me. Leave Stephan. Silence. I claim the monster slayer. Seize it, Stephan, before he wields it against your mother. Farewell, my son. With no master to guide you, you will soon be dust. Marius? Who's there? Who's there? Radu? Heaven's brother. What's happened? I'm defiled. May God have mercy on your soul. Stake me to the ground. Let the sun destroy me. I cannot. I beg. Or I will be a plague upon the Earth. Forgive me, Marius. I was a fool. No, Radu. I should not have left you. Cursed one, you treacherous monk. Show him Mercy. Mercy is for the weak. Fear not, my child. Vladislas has fled upon the north wind. She cursed me with the blood of Nosferatu. Your father cursed you at the moment of our union. Church made you pretty, but in time your face will betray your bloodline. Let me die before I thirst for blood. You are as I am. Immortal. Nothing can destroy you. Come with me. Together we'll lay wast to Vladislas and his clan and keep the bloodstone as your prize. So began my century-long apprenticeship in the black arts. I learned to draw power from the earth and sky. Incantation to summon demons. The skills of the hunt. Stealth and speed. And all the while, visions of Helena tormented my dreams. After all I've done for you, you dare steal from me? Curse you, rite of Vladislas. I forbid you to return. I ventured out into the darkness to seek Helena and the solace of the bloodstone. I slept far from the light of day in crypts of the dead, Tormented by dreams of my brother and my master, Helena. I ached for kindred spirits to share the endless night, for some spell binding thing of beauty that could soothe the slow crawl of time. I found it in the music of Ash and Ariel. Thank you, kind friends. It has been an honor for us to perform to you our songs tonight. We are the humble troubadours, Jonathan Ash and my beautiful sister, Ariel. It's not even enough for a room at the inn. The villagers here are more used to music that makes them get up and dance. My brother and I are serious composers, not dancing monkeys. You're welcome to sleep here tonight. Thank you sir. But don't touch my wine or my daughter. You have my word. What troubles you, sister? Did you see that strange man lurking at the back of the crowd? I saw a bakers dozen of strange people today. These villages can be quite amusing. I'm serious, Jonathan. This man, he had an aura of death. Who are you? Come to me? What do you want? Let me cross your threshold. No, please leave us alone. Come to me and I'll initiate you to the mysteries. Father, lord in heaven, protect us from this evil spirit. Jonathan, Jonathan, wake up. What? What's wrong? The demon. He's come back. What demon? Don't be silly. Hello? Someone there? Show yourself. I must warn you, I am armed. It's the angel of death. Fear not, pretty ones. We are guests of King Carol, on route to perform for the royal wedding. I am Radu Vladislas, knight of the church, to escort you safely to your destination. You're a knight of the church. You spoke to me of the mysteries. Let us see your face. What's wrong with you? I'm shamed by my bloodline. Spirit, please sir, I beg of you. The king will send his men to search for us. Your royal patronage is a pittance compared with what I offer. And what is it you're offering? Eternal life. Undying devotion in return for your companionship and the solace of your music. No. Jonathan, please. Our father who are in heaven. - Quiet, sister. - Protect us from this evil spirit. Let us hear him out. You sir, you are patron. Guardian. Protector. Embrace me and your music will resonate with the myteries and you will live forever. You would teach us the mysteries. I will initiate Ariel. No. As her mentor? Her master. Our music will live without your help. God is my shepherd. I seek no master. Come to me willingly and I will have you both as my disciples. I'm a willing student. Make my music immortal. No! Vampire, burn in hell. Bow to me, Ariel and I resurrect your brother. No. Jonathan. Jonathan, wake up. Life or death. The choice is yours. Life. Life. Accept me Ariel, and I'll resurrect the both of you, and you two will never fade. Please Ariel. For the love of God. Choose life. Life. You are my children now. The night has fallen. What have you done to us? I blessed you with eternal life. What is this place? This is a catacomb of my father's castle. No, no. Help, please! There's no one to hear you. No hope of escape. We together now. Do not touch me. You've destroyed us. We demand to be set free. Oh you will be free when you are ready. And when will that be? When all traces of your existence has faded from memory, you will live again. Avatars of music. You will burn for this. Kneel to me and I'll be generous. Keep your vile hands off my flute or I swear to God I will kill you. It is forbidden to harm your master. You are not our master. You are a fiend. I'm your only hope of survival. Soon a craving will overwhelm your senses. A thirst that only blood can satisfy. You have so much to learn. I left them to suffer the first pangs of blood thirst and solitude and uncertainty. Our father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Feed fledglings. Before your thirst drives you mad. Stay away from us. One sip of blood can sustain you for days. You can live on her for months. I would die first. Oh you died already. You've been reborn. This is your gateway to eternity. You cannot deny your craving. No! Drink. No. Oh, blood is life. Jonathan, no. It's noble of you to cling to your human heart. I too was human once upon a time. Surrender to your cravings. No! There's no shame in it. Drink fledgling, her blood will ease your despair. Drink. Drink. Do not kill. Gentle, gentle. Drink. Oh. You magnificent creature. The sadness will pass. Years passed. I had fledglings to ease my solitude. Ariel to worship. But visions Helena never ceased to thrill and haunt me. The endless bloodlust had driven Ariel mad and left Ash an empty shell. Ash, my child. What is your desire? Music. My soul is starved for harmony. I have longed for this moment. Ariel, come, fill the night with songs. Your wretched fingers have defiled it. Ariel, please. It could bring us peace. Play fledgling. Comfort me. Do not defy me. My soul is barren. Without joy there is no music. Yes. Give us solace. Joy's not the only muse. There is comfort too in songs of heartbreak. My muse has fled. In time Ariel accepted me as a master. I honored my vow and initiated them to the mysteries and shared with them the raptures of the kill. Let's just run away together. Really? You really think we should? I do. I think we just should get out of here. And what? And while I indulged them, feeling kinship for the first time since my love for Marius, and my distraction, while Leia defiled. Help me please. My father will reward you. By the power of the church, I purge this evil place. May God, have mercy on your soul. Radu, what is this? Night of the dragon. I'm Diana, appointed to slay you. You high spirit. What's your bloodline? I'm descended from the sorceress Calisto. You are a stolen child like I was forced to serve the church their calling. To rid the world of monsters like you. This demon slayer was taken from Circe on the night of your birth. It will end your torment once and for all Hand it to me and I'll show you mercy. Curse you. You are no match for me. Drink, fledglings. Save the blood of a living god. Give me the relic or you'll suffer. We have suffered long enough. We have mastered the mysteries. We'll seek our fortune in the great night. I'm your master, but I spurn you as my fledgling. Without my guidance, you will perish in agony. 300 years they roamed the earth, haunting the world of arts and music. 300 years I searched for them. I lament the day I found them. In time, my appearance betrayed my bloodline. Hello. fledglings. Kneel before your master. You are not the master here. This city is ruled by our queen. Return my mother's demon slayer. It was taken from us centuries ago. The vampire queen seized it in exchange for sanctuary. I know where it is. We can lead you there. It's in the city beneath the city. Take me to your queen. This is one of the seven entrances to the city beneath the city. Be ware what you say here. The sound travels to the ancient corners where demons dwell. I hear music. There is a brothel and casino on the street above us. Our principle source of income and willing partners. My queen. May we enter You ventured out again without my blessing. I'm sorry your majesty. I hunger for the hunt. No, it was my fault. I crave for music. Who is this stranger? Our first master, my queen. Bring him before me. Helena. You know my name. Don't you remember me? Radu Vladislas, brother to Stephan. Radu, the Fearless. My savior. You have aged. It is five centuries since you defiled me. Releasee my fledglings and return the holy relic they stole from my Leia. I will speak with your master in private. Amuse yourselves in my library, but do not kill her. What became of Stephan? Vladislas let him grow to manhood, then stole him from the sun. He roams the new world now, a man of wealth and science. And Vladislas? The eternal darkness drove him mad. He begged me to end his suffering. He lies entombed in the catacombs below, the sword of Laertes impaled through his heart. And the bloodstone? As you intended. It has been my salvation. I will share it with you if you pledge your devotion. I'm yours from the day I saw you. There is ecstasy enough from both of us. Drink Ariel. Her blood is sweet. I'm sickened by this languid way of feeding. I seek for blood that reeks fear. For five centuries you haunted me. The perfume of your skin, the purity of your love for Stephan. I cannot dwell upon the past. Memories fill me with despair. At least we're together. You were my savior once. All that is mine, Radu, can be yours. My land. The bloodstone. If you bestow upon me one act of devotion. Your fledgling Ash. Ash is not worthy of you. You are a monster, Radu. Ash is a pretty one. I could toy with him for centuries. I was born of ancient blood. I wanna be your consort. Like old friends, let's talk of our futures. Come fledglings. Your master and I have struck a bargain. As proof of his devotion, Radu has given you to me. From this day forth, I will be your master. Hold me above Radu and all that I possess is yours to share. But we have lived apart from him for centuries. We are not his property to trade Silence her, Radu. Radu told me that you were troubadours once and that your music moved him deeply. That was another lifetime. Our muse abandoned us so long ago. Vladislas defiled our instruments. Bite your tongue, girl. Your Radu's plaything. You mean nothing to me. Nor you to me. Radu is my Lord and master, may he reign bloody hell upon you. Discipline her Radu or I will banish her. Don't you threaten me. I'll bend her to the path. Break her or I will banish you both. Go to your chamber. Come, I have a gift for you. Master, my chamber is this way. The lower levels are forbidden. What I seek is forbidden. Master, please deliver us from this wretched place. I will serve you till the end. Patience, pretty one. Patience. You resurrected me. What is your name, that I may reward you. I am your first born. Radu Vladislas. Now to fulfill my destiny. My gift to you. Find your joy again. We have all the time in the world. Strike us a wondrous chord. I am barren. From this day forth, the blood of the saints shall be your muse. Drink. Drink. Drink. My muse. She's whispering to me. Open your heart. Give voice to the epiphanies. You crossed my threshold uninvited. I showed you mercy and you stole my life. And yet I'll serve until the end of time. Will you not feel emotion when you look into my eyes? When I look into your eyes, I feel revulsion. You are an abomination, Radu. You reek of the grave. Your touch is repulsive. Your voice is as loathsome as the the breath that conveys it. And your proud blood makes me- No, no, no, no! All that I owe to you. No, Radu. It is forbid to kill your master. I have no master. Master, stop. You're destroying her. Sister, I have the bloodstone, we must leave now. It's all we need. Curse you, Radu. I will be reborn and haunt you till the end of time. Master, she has your blade. Master, my brother, he stole your bloodstone. Are you dying, Master? I'm cursed to live forever. Let me drink from your wound. It's a shame for it to waste. Ariel. If you choose to abandon me, I will not stalk. This night has set you free. If I'm truly free, Radu, I was done to be your fledgling. I will be your concert. I pledge myself to thee. Radu Vladislas. I have searched the world for you. At last, we are united. You are blood of my blood. You cannot harm me. I can harm you grievously. She was my redemption. How dare you seek make believe legacies. To watch you suffer is a rare delight. A delight that will surely ripen with time. I'll leave you to your suffering and send you to hell another day. I'm here to purge this nest of evil, be gone when I return. I left Ariel to the merciless sun, vowing never to return to this dark place. But in time, the shadow of Helena, my master and creator, will fulfill her curse, and torment me to madness.
