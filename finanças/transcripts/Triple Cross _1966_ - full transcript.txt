converted file from 25fps to 23.676 LongNeck file FINAL Give us a hand, Will you? Thank you! Mornin', Guvnor Move along then..... Move! RADIO: 'This is the BBC. In a spectacular burglary last night, The Gelignite Gang struck again. Today a street musician was released from custody after assisting the police in their inquiry. Lord Beaverbrook today firmly stated That war is impossible in our time. Speaking at a banquet... It was reliably reported today that the explosive used by the so-called "Gelignite Gang" in their daring series of burglaries in and around London and home counties in recent weeks may in reality, be some secret new compound introduced from abroad. ..expressed their confidence in the Maginot line. Scotland Yard today revealed it has detailed 17 of it's most qualified personnel to halt the operations of the Gelignite Gang. Investigations disclose that at the scenes of each of the recent burglaries quantities of discarded chewing gum have been discovered leading the authorities to believe that the crimes are the work of a band of foreigners Possibly Americans RADIO: ... in the daring middle of the night raid on the Union Cinema in Hampstead, Police were interviewing all persons known to them to have participated In safe-breaking activities of a more conventional kind With war clouds gathering over France, More and more Britons are turning to the Channel Islands for their summer holidays. At St Helier, on the Isle of Jersey, hotel accommodation are this year at a premium. Public houses and Restaurants report record business... Its BBC, Excuse me Sir May I know your profession? Financier.... I handle other peoples money. And what make you choose Jersey for your holiday? Well, they tell me that, uh ...... Friendships ... ripen ... quickly here. Open up the door!! Open it up, Chapman! Eddie Chapman, You're under arrest! Je ne comprends pas anglais. Grab him! Apart from its many diversions - its water sports, its golfing and its tennis Jersey today is renowned for an atmosphere of tranquility and repose. Many Britons think of retiring on this island. They speak of its unconfined atmosphere, it's fortunate climate, the unusual pilons that permeates the landscape... In sunny Jersey, it is said, Every day is exactly the same as every other Room service! Come on, you lousy bunch of screws! MOVE!...Move your fat bottoms! .... Come on! Ain't there enough trouble going on round here? Come here....Look! What's that lot of Germans doing out there. Now Come on!! Tell me! There's a war on, isn't there? Haven't you heard the news, Chapman? 10 months solitary! How the hell can I be expected to know happening around here? Now Is there a war on or not? I thought so. So, they've taken Jersey, have they? If I were you I wouldn't be caught parading around with a chest full of medals, Grandad. They might think you got them for killing Germans the last time. What is it you want Chapman? I want the German Commandant! Not that one again! Yes that again! And tell him I don't like to be kept waiting. You're a cocky one. - Look... If we don't push ourselves, nobody else ever will. Let me tell you, the more scared you are, talk louder. You can get away with murder. Now go and tell the commandant I want to see him! This is Outrageous! You really think he wants to burn down the prison? He was trying to set light to himself, Sir, That's what he was doing. Come In! ..... What, What's That? What's the meaning of this? Please Shut the door, There's a terrible draft. On your feet Chapman in the presence of the commandant. Look who's giving orders around here now! I'm Sorry about all this, But it seemed the only way to get in touch with you. Now that You are in touch with me. What object did you have? I want to save your job for you. - Save my job for me? - Yes. Because You'll lose it if you don't do what I ask. Do what YOU ask? Don't you understand I could have you shot. Possibly, But I'm asking you, in front of witnesses, To get a message pretty damn quickly to your German intelligence. And I'd hate to be in your shoes if they ever found out that you hadn't passed it. Do you think they could be interested in a message from a thief like you? They will be, when they find out it's an Englishman who wants to help them and once more - who can. - That's all you want? Just that? - Just that. Have the lock of this door changed. Every day! Heil Hinkle! Quiet! There my Dear Countess ... As impressive a list of honors as we have seen for many a day. Wanted by Scotland Yard for thirty broken safes, Two escapes from prison, Here read the rest for yourself. Facing 14 years further imprisonment. Very Interesting. For what we have in mind I think he has possibilities. For what I have in mind, You've have possibilities! I like you, Herr Chapman. I like his wicked tongue. Wicked tongues can be dangerous. Chapman, evidently you are clever. Are you clever enough to see now Now that now you've met all of us, Puts You in a position to identify us Therefore will be most certainly be shot? That is to say... That is to say unless you hire me? Who are you ....... Chapman? After Three hours of questioning, 22 cigarettes from the lady over there I thought you'd understood by now. I'm a realist, I'm in prison and I want to get OUT! I don't give a DAMN for Germany or for England either. Why should I? What have they done for me lately? You haven't finished? You're Damn right I'm not finished. Only one side is going to win this war and I'm going to be on that side. Whichever it is? Yes, whichever it is. If it's England, God help me. I've got fifteen years ahead of me behind bars. Fourteen England.... England will be no more.... It will be razed to the ground. Well, Have I a choice? I'd rather live for Germany than die for England. And if we wanted you to die..... For Germany? The price would be the same..... High ..... Of course. Of course. Have the Commandant take him back to the cell. Herr Chapman? It is possible you will hear from us. More probably you will not. That file in front of you speaks for itself. You don't see recommendations like that every day of the week, uh. Well? Much too soon to say. It is obvious, he's a risk. Why do you say that, Keller? Merely Judging from his dossier He cares too much for women. Acute observation, they say about him in the file. That cigarette will make exactly 23 Chapman! Wouldn't listen, Would you? Well, I'll put in a word for you I'll see you get promoted! Chapman! What is it? Sign here What for? Your effects Check 'em Get in then, Go on SS OFFICER WHISTLES Where are you taking me? HE CONTINUES TO WHISTLE At least it is in the direction of Paris. Yes? Charming! Make yourself at home, Englander Oh Well, Thank You! It's for the foreigners. I hope you stay alive a few days to enjoy it Just like home, isn't it? I'm Chapman. Laars Veriman Where are you from? Stockholm What they got you in here for? They picked me up in Paris, my papers weren't in order. Where are we? Romanville 10km north of Paris, Sort of a transit camp Some of us they send on, Most of us they shoot. Any way out? No, there's not enough time to plan an escape route. Get in there! Bastards! Bastards! At least they left me with these Have one? And you? Superstitious What else are you? Maltese So why bring me here? Malta's not at war with Hitler What did they grab you boys for? Me, I was a waiter at the Savoy grill. They thought I was a spy. - Are you? You must have a great sense of humor. If I told you... THEY SPEAK GERMAN You've got a nerve asking the Commander to come down here. Yes, I thought you might understand German. Now look, You may be a pigeon they've planted on us, or you may not Unless you want to wake up cold and stiff one morning, you just better keep out of my way. Remember...... I'm superstitious too, Huh In my book, three's a crowd. Its Nice to know they got women here. Ya, This place has got everything. Qu'est-ce qu'il y a dedans? Where did you get 'em from? One of the guards Can you get us some? Have one now! - No, Next time. There may not be a next time. What's your name? Paulette There'll be a next time. Come on, come on now. Come on. Get the ball now, Look at me. Come on. Look at me now. Get the ball One, two and three Get the ball Ah, there you are You rascal Where have you been, huh? Paulette... - Sshhh At the far end, the other side. And who are you? Franz, I'll call on you sometime. Life is so dull here What are you doing here? Ssh, nothing to worry about. Are you mad? They can send you to Germany or just shoot you! How long have you been here? A month, but what's that do with it? Everything You're right, you're so right. - Move along there. - Good night, Chapman. I must know your name. What Does it matter? Quiet! Sorry I got you into this. - I can tell them it was my fault. Silence! - Paulette, Paulette Gehehr. - QUIET! Inventory, sign here. - What for? - Property of EA Chapman. £24 in notes, six shillings in silver, one gold-plated watch. Gold-plated? You must be out of your mind! I never wear imitation! Well... put down solid gold. And what address where they can be sent to? Address? I don't get you. - So they can be restored after the war. Put them with the other things you're holding for Paulette Gehehr A charming thought. She can have them if and when she ever gets out. You know what they're going to do with me? I have an idea. Having been a waiter, I suppose you know the difference between a sheep and a goat. I don't get you. For either one they hang you! Take him away! GET HIM OUT! RAUS!!!! Back to work, go on. RAUS!!! This man is dangerous. He's a public menace. Not for long Goodbye, Goodbye! Gawd bless you! So long, Eddie. Our turn next! Anything to say, Chapman? Well, it's been a great life. Achtung! Ready ... Aim ... Fire! "Shot while attempting to escape." But why a Jersey newspaper? For circulation in England to those who matter. As an added precaution, your little friend was released - Paulette something. If as we think she's in the Resistance, they will pass that back. Yeah, but the date. Tomorrow's date. Your new name is Franz Grauman, private, second-class, in the Germany Army. - Franz who? - Grauman, remember it. Grauman, lovely. What else must I remember? Not to ask questions. Not to go near the radio room, unless accompanied. Not to mix with men from the other sections And to listen to whatever I have to tell you. Whatever WHATEVER! Oh I'm sorry, Was I crowding you? Any time Franz, You are about to meet your new Chief, The Head of the Abwehrstelle Ast, Colonel Baron Von Grunen. Be careful with him. He is, well... unpredictable. - But a very, very remarkable man. - Uh-huh. - I thought all the servants left before darkness. - They always used to. I will inquire into it at once Report to me, Come on Go on in Can't you salute? Herr Steinhager, It takes time to learn to salute. Are you well, Countess? Well enough The Long motor trips are always tiring. I suggest you get some sleep. Tomorrow morning at nine, Herr Steinhager. Nine o'clock. - Good night. - Good night. Deutsche Ordnung German order Sit down You've gone from safe-cracker and prisoner, to private second-class, and a potential member of the most successful espionage group in the army, Abwehrstelle Ast A long way in one day To the health of uh.... Franz Grauman. I thought you only drank to the Fuhrer's health. Or To the health of the king of England. I'll drink to mine. Mine is more important too me. I see you might be described as a businessman. Nice, Makes a change brandy with a pedigree. This object also has a pedigree. It's Persian, six or seven hundred years old, isn't it? Uh Huh... And it can be destroyed in a fraction of a second. You were once one of His Majesty's footguards. Did they teach you how to shoot? I can shoot From there.... shoot the head off this animal. You obey orders in a roundabout way. But this time it happens to suit me. Now You didn't really want me to do that did you. The shot you just fired Grauman .... Either broke the microphone that I believe is hidden in this room or the eardrums of the man who was listening in. Behind the paintings or in the lamps, no doubt. I'm telling you all this as a warning. Mistrust EVERYBODY! Oh, I always have. I mean EVERYBODY without exception. Clear? Good night Franz Grauman. And Grauman, tomorrow you will say "Colonel" or "Sir". You will salute properly as in the army by clicking your heels Or if wearing a cap touching it with your hand. All right... Baron. Goodnight. DEE-DEE, DA-DA, Some people just can't distinguish the difference. Hopeless to try and teach them. The best place to hide the igniter - the join in the rails. Cover the wire with a dead fly or a piece of dirt. Or anything. Code, Keep as simple as possible - the Bible, any well-known book. An agent mustn't carry any heavy or incriminating equipment. Everything has to be home-made, Found anywhere You can Improvise. Flash powder with sugar and saltpeter, This you can find in a hardware store. Paper washed with saltpeter can give a five-second fuse. Longer if necessary The day of the month the same number as one of the psalms as your key for codes. To make a time fuse - an ordinary watch. Use the either the minute or the hour hand to touch the wire and make the contact. Watch the light bulb. A substitute for an explosion. A human igniter sometimes works even better. The springs, Even a rat trap. You don't need much weight Send XXX at the end of every message otherwise we know you've been captured. A home-made detonator out of a child's toy A construction set Let someone else do the job for you This is just one of our own manufacture A gun for firing round corners. You see the enemy in the mirror. He can't see you. Everything there you can find in hardware stores, pharmacies, beauty shops all to make an flash point ... an explosive. Set if off with any friendly, familiar object Secret radio frequencies of other agents, Not your business. He should be ready in two months Colonel, I have certain doubts about him. I told you he was to be one of your responsibilities, Countess. Study him thoroughly It could be worthwhile I maintain, The English Secret Service trained him and imprisoned him in Jersey, So that he could infiltrate himself into our service. I also suggest his criminal past is nothing but a fiction meant to deceive us. I do not believe it. I say he endangers our work here. And I suggest You have a personal prejudice against him. Herr Steinhager, you discovered him You investigated him. You arranged for him to be watched. Are you having second thoughts too? Baron, I trust no-one. I'm a security officer. It's my duty to suspect everyone. Even those who are here Are you going to say that you also suspect the Fuhrer? I didn't go to the University of Heidelberg, nor the Staff College at Pottsdam like yourself. Before I joined the army, I was a policeman. And as a policeman, I know men The discussion is closed Franz Grauman will be trained for an extremely important mission For which you don't have to know about for the moment You are to Report to me anything Grauman says or does, No matter how charming and pleasant a companion he turns out to be You seem determined to force me into this man's bed. My dear Baron, Anybody would think I need a procurer. Not Procurer, a manager. - Yes, that's how you saw it always. I saw that in your case, someone was needed to develop your latent possibilities. Latent possibilities, Charmingly put. Yes, You had costly and highly sophisticated training in England. I was hoping to see some results of it now. One day I must tell you exactly how costly it has been, For Me. You already have, several times. Ahh, There is your Grauman. Back to work..... Good hunting. Now Who sent you in here? I couldn't sleep. You didn't try hard enough. - What's the matter? - Couldn't sleep. I could read you a nursery rhyme. Or sing you a lullaby. Just you try You should hear me sing. A voice like a cornflake on a stormy night. That's Better Tell me, what is the matter? Ohhh, It's this place it's beginning to get me down. I'm not surprised. They made you work like a mad man. Parachutist school... That damn parachute training, I can hardly move Come on, turn over - I'll give you a rub. Huh,,Turn my back on you? You must be out of your mind? Now Don't be a fool - I am in charge of the English section, and You are one of the English section, So - What's so funny? Tell me. - Oh, this whole business. Every spy is another little spy and that little spy ... Well of course, it's a shabby business. But what did you expect You're not training for the priesthood here, Stop complaining The money is good. I haven't seen any of it yet. Don't feel sorry for yourself, You're not the only one! There. - Oh. Yes, boss. I suppose so.. I suppose anyone ..... - What, you suppose? - If anyone can be honest in this business, it's you. Yes, honest little Helga Lindstrohm. The poor man's Mata Hari. Who, if she could give me away, would do it. I wouldn't enjoy giving you away, You know that But you would. But that's what I'm paid for, isn't it? I think I like you. Helga Lindstrohm. I think I like you. - I'm glad you do. It's not part of the deal, but I prefer it like this. Probably on their way to Cherborg. Well, at least we can both say it isn't one of ours. Got a light? Ive got a lighter. Gentlemen, there is very little time. British and Canadian forces landed an hour ago at Dieppe Probably a diversionary tactic for an all-out invasion elsewhere on the coast. Abwehrstelle Ast must suspend all training activities and concentrate on rounding up any potential French Resistance personnel. I'm handing over control of this operation to Colonel Steinhager. His experience in these matters are far greater than mine. Yes, Colonel. Kellar, I want you ride with me. We meet in 30 minutes. This way Open up .... Open up! Fritz! Quick, finish your message and hide the radio. Come on! Come on! Come on! HEAVY KNOCKING I'm finished. Collet, Go to the bedroom on the third floor. Take the back staircase. Open up! Open up! German police! Quiet! Open this door! Quick! What is it? Yes! Come In. Papers? Search them Franz, always do that first. Who did you take that watch from? WHO DID YOU TAKE THAT WATCH FROM!!! I didn't take it. Who from? It was given to me. By whom? - A girl. - Her name? Her name? Just a girl. Want to tell me where she is? WANT TO TELL ME WHERE SHE IS!!! On the Third Floor! Bravo, Grauman!! You're beginning to learn the business. All right, I'll look after them now. You search the other apartments. Get up Now I want to talk to you Get up! Eddie, that's you... Shhhh - Quiet! Why are you wearing that uniform? You gave this away, Didn't You? In the Camp they said that you were dead. Now Look! You have to get out of here NOW, Today.. otherwise you're finished. Leave an address with someone in this house Next time, Don't give this away. Ah. Am I intruding? You intrude? Never! No, that's not your type... Surely? We're after bigger fish than that, Aren't We. She's nothing but small fry. Name? Proceed Name? Gilligan, Duncan....... Private I don't want to interrupt you. 113030 The Name's James I'm a sergeant. Name.....Number 483295. - Rank? - Lieutenant Number? 632051 Huh!... Here's a wife in a million. To Whom It May Concern "This is to certify that while overseas, away from me Sergeant William George Daniels, my lawfully wedded husband, "has full permission to consort with any pretty girl he may meet." You speak it pretty good, Don't you buster. Well, Four years in night school, you do pick it up a bit you know. One of them, are you? Hey Fellows, Take a look. Another bloody renegade... One of the Lord Haw-Haw's gang Ohh..Push off, will you? Well, as I was saying, before I was interrupted... One lighter, one 20 size packet of Players containing 12 cigarettes, three-penny bus ticket, bar of chocolate, hotel bill, box of matches... Leave the rest here, Keller. Does it mean Colonel that against my recommendation you are going to use Grauman after all? It means check items listed, nothing more. Do you approve the contract? It seems all right, but uh why a contract? Deutsche Ordnung This is a personal contract between you and me. It gives me control of you. Neither The Luftwaffe or the Kriegsmarine can have the use of your services - without permission from me. They want me? Succeed in this assignment and they'll all be after you. I don't know what this assignment is. You won't know ..... Till the last moment. Unless the British paid their troops in counterfeit money that's Sterling. We took over £1 million at Dunkirk alone. Now are you ready to sign the contract or do you have any more questions? Two questions Yes The 100,000 marks I get paid - when and how? When you succeed in your mission In any currency you wish. Are they in there? The safe Sign I think this calls for a celebration. If I'd been running the Savoy Grill, you'd have been fired the first day. To Your navigation, Major... Swimming the Channel was never one of my ambitions. Your people live very well Colonel. But of course Major. Can't you see? We truely lack nothing here. Nothing at all. Yes, My people are special Exceptional talents deserve exceptional treatment Are all of them equally... special? You have a mission tonight Major. You mustn't flirt with me. In this room are Some of the most highly trained specialists in the world. - Ahh. - Care to see a demonstration? Using only this watch as a time fuse. Albert there will blow up one of the trees outside of the house at the stroke of nine. Let me go with him, keep an eye on him. Good idea - you haven't been drinking. I have been drinking! My God have I been Drinking. Now he has gone. Nine O'clock It must be fast! My people don't make mistakes. Not of this sort I heard you What a foxes - What a foxes. I'll check it with the nine o'clock on the BBC. You mean You listen to the British? You heard what the Colonel said - special treatment. RADIO: This is the BBC Home And Forces programme. Here is the Nine O'Clock news... And This is Alvar Liddell Reading it. Grauman! Where are you, Grauman? Grauman! Where's Grauman? I've looked everywhere. Where were you? I cut it on some broken glass. Let me look at it for you. You don't think I cut it myself? Now, really! Good luck Thank you Eddie Oh Now, here are your special instructions. Within 15 minutes of landing in England, you must get on the air to us with a safe landing signal. 15 Minutes! That's a must! Otherwise we'll be sending another plane with a replacement. 15 minutes - clear? You'll hear from me in much less time than that. Heil Hinkle! Jolly Alberrt!!! Heil Hitler! Oh, Heil Hitler Herr Colonel ... They are transmitting. They are circling the landing area. We are here, Stand by Hey, you bloody fool! The release check. He's not going to transmit. I can tell you exactly what he's doing right now. He's given up every intention of carrying out his mission. He's trying to get a ride into the nearest town. Still nothing yet. Are you convinced now, Colonel? That makes 40 minutes. We'll wait another half an hour. Made in France? Bastards! I want you to bring him back to me Dead or Alive! We shall get the cars ready. The cars are ready outside. Come on Come on I'm convinced you are making a mistake. It may be woman's intuition but I have a feeling something's happened to him. No, Colonel Steinhager was right to impose this test Otherwise a serious mistake might have been made. Well, If you've caught him, I'm glad it wasn't I who caught him for you. I'm going to bed. Wait! Wait! I've got something. Herr Baron, I've got him now. What is it? Grauman, He is transmitting. Tell him to stay where he is, we're coming for him. Your feminine intuition, Countess, Remarkable. Come on! Grauman! What kept you You bloody imbeciles? Who the Hell do you think you are anyway..Comedians? Did you fall on a bank or a strong box? Right in the middle of that red bleeding tree! Do You Mind! Stop that! Grauman! Grauman, I had to put you to the test. Charming ! Damn Well the last time I'm jumping, that's all. Thank you very much. Next time will be the real thing. My nerves won't take it. It's the shock. I'm scared to hell of it. It's the shock Really? Yes It's gonna bloody well take a bigger shock than that to get me back to normal. By that you mean...uhh? An extra thousand pounds. Who sent you in here? I couldn't sleep Try harder At least you'll be sure of one thing .... for now. Is that all you have to say to me? No.... Heil Hitler(!) - SHE GIGGLES - Heil Hitler! The factory entrance Only one policeman on duty Power plant The position for explosives Thank you, Lars You can take your equipment later And You won't forget Franz, All the codewords I taught you? No, no, no. And the XXX at the end? Clear as mud. See you later Now these photographs are much more detailed. Study them Carefully. Come On! I've been on this for five days, I know them backwards. Know them frontwards too. This is your last chance. And Grauman, always remember one thing You're under contract to me. These are clean. One lighter, Box of matches. You'd better drop me in the right place this time or else. All right ..All right. Here Put this on, it will make you feel better. What is it? Tonic for your nerves. It's a thousand pounds, You hinted you would like. I hope it's all right. I don't like passing counterfeit, that's not honest Sling me one of those, Would you Keller? May I have a cigarette, please? One last thing. If you're captured, take this. It's very effective. - It kills instantly. Oh, Thank you, how touching! You have three days, If We don't hear from you within that time, I'll simply write you off. Three days I will be back, You can count on that. Safer up there than down here. You go onto the plane, Sir. - I'll bring Chapman. Have we crossed the English Channel yet? We have crossed it ANTI-AIRCRAFT FIRE I thought I was unpopular down there, but this is ridiculous! Green light, Stand By! Position report, Sir. Aircraft...circling...dropping zone Altitude... - 1,200 - Leo, go and tell the Colonel. Stop that noise! What the Devil do you want? I'm a British airman, I'm sorry I've had an accident. - May I use your telephone? - Telephone? - Yes, I've got to get to the police. It all checks, sir. One of these radio frequencys was already on our intercept list of enemy agents in Norway. Looks as though he is telling the truth Sir. You just produce Eddie Chapman's criminal record I can answer any question from it. Anything, In detail. Chapman or whatever your name is I'll be blunt. Our position is that the real Eddie Chapman was executed a long time ago in Jersey. Look Sir, I dropped out of the sky up there to make a deal with you down here. But my bargaining position is getting weaker every second. NOW COME ON!!! This is the third day! Who'll be held responsible for not buying some of the best intelligence To come your way during this whole bloody War? .... You Will! And Pretty uniforms and your old school ties. By having nerve, you may have got away with murder with your German friends. But it's not going to work here. It worked before, it can work again. If you try it on with that, you'll find that you will never be allowed to transmit that message. Or you may find yourself back in prison for those 14 years you referred to. What do you have to say about that? Well Sir, I'd say... "It would all be a terrible waste." Hmm. Frankly, so would I. CLICKING Remember the three Xs. Oh, thank you. - If we don't hear anything, we'll try again. - Yes. BEEPING Blow up... Vickers... Thursday... 03.00... hours. Repeat 03.00 hours precisely for reconnaissance check. Jolly Albert terra terra." What's that last bit? It's a private joke Sir, One of the chaps in the Abwehrsteller... Alberrr, You know the stool pigeon I told you about a bit on the uhhh Spare us the details. Right Sir Reconnaissance check means they must be taking this pretty seriously. Or could it just mean that they don't trust Chapman They will have to trust him Sir because of the job Now you don't mean to tell me that you are actually going to let me to blow up Vickers. It'll be worthwhile if you fall in with what we have in mind for you later. I'm always open to a proposition. Even if it means going back to the Germans? But Working for us, this time. This time on an exclusive basis. Exclusive, that comes extra. At least you have merit of being consistent Chapman, I'll say that for you. Well, I mean going back there ...... My life is in pretty good danger. It's in pretty good danger now. A man who drops into England by parachute with a German radio And the Identity card of a man who's been reported dead...... You could hang for that. That last remark has a rather nasty sound. Not at all what I expected from British fair play. Well now that we have established that you're not going back for patriotic reasons, What else would interest you? £10,000. Half in advance, in cash. I don't trust banks, people will keep robbing them. £10,000, that's all? A free pardon. And a nice, shiny medal like the one he's got on. It's a pleasure to do business with you Chapman. You know so clearly what you want. But I neglected to tell you, In case we don't through with this Vickers sabotage, - You were a guardsman, weren't you? - Mm-hmm. Your call-up papers for the army will be served on you by breakfast. Blackmail. This war has destroyed all moral values, really. Besides, I'm a pacifist. I'm against all wars. That makes two of us. Coming? Well, my instructions were precise. Join in with the rest of the nightshift. Stop, here. And go through one of the gates, like that one there. I was told to join in with the workers. Listen to what the men in front had to say. - Hello, Charlie! Hello, Bert! Hey, you! Your cap You have to go to one of the washrooms hide up there till midnight, When there's a meal break, Join in with the mob again. This gets you into the main factory area. The next part's much the worse. Von Grunen told me the food will be quite ghastly....... He wasn't fooling. My orders were then to follow the others out, staying till the last. The end building houses the generator plant. The main dynamo that supplies power to the whole factory. 22 paces from the north corner of the building... ..You plant your plastic explosive. Insert the igniter. Set your wrist-watch time fuse for a seven-hour delay. My orders were then to go back to the washroom, Hide out in there, until 6am when the night staff goes off Then like the rest of them, make your way home. Now, do you believe me? Interesting, anyway. Sitting out here all night, I've been thinking. If I can persuade the War Cabinet to take a chance, Would you go through with your part of the deal? What do you mean by War Cabinet taking a chance? Well, for instance, justice. Lord Beaverbrook has been held up by the Prime Minister, But he's on his way, He apologises. But speaking for the Ministry of Aircraft Production, I can only say that we would take a very dim view of your blowing up one of our biggest factories, as your memorandum suggests. Jerry's so keen to have Chapman destroy the Vickers works. At least it indicates that our raids are more successful than we thought. But You do understand our problem, if Chapman fails to carry out this mission, the Germans will know there's something fishy. And His value to us as an agent is destroyed. I must confess my ignorance as to your Mr Chapman's activities here. But However valuable his services maybe, You can't expect the Ministry of Aircraft Production to allow one of its plants To be put out of action for a whole month. My friend, I have news for you. After I've seen Lord Beaverbrook, That's precisely what I do expect. First time I ever had a cop carry my tools to and from a job. You know You'd make a pretty good Gelignite man. Whenever I get back into business, You'll gonna be my first choice. Go back Into business, You'll be mine. An unidentified aircraft in sight of the coast Coming in at southeast minus ten. Call all anti-aircraft batterys group 7, Let the unidentified aircraft through. It's one of ours returning from a mission. No, sir. The unidentified aircraft is German. You said it might be. So they are sending one to find out whats going on? It's just as I... TELEPHONE RINGS Anti AirCraft Battery 554 states the aircraft is out of range, continuing on its way. That's Funny. It's even burning on the roofs we didn't go near. Somebody else must have been smoking. Let's get back. 17:35, the Admiral, Brigadier Dalrymple, WAAF officer, name unknown. Well, you seem to be very comfortable here. Well..It's a bit racier than most prisons I know. This is Squadron Officer Laurence She is one of our top camouflage people. She's very proud of the work she did for us last night... Show him. Those false buildings your erected made a damn good fire! Should have fooled the Germans. Ah!... It's taken in the dark. Yes - infrared film. UnHuh. You didn't tell me you did that much damage. So it looks to me and I'm an expert. And this one - taken not more than five minutes after the German plane had gone. - So his photos would be... Not much different from that one. Uhhh.. But The factory, How long will that be out of action? Hours only, The night shift will be on schedule at midnight. Terribly Sorry Sir, but they're calling Chapman here on the radio. Answer for me, will you? You know all of the codes by heart by now. Ahh, They could identify your finger on the tapper. Take care of this. No... ..Submarine possible. Proceed... Lisbon...by ship Last message That's funny No Good show or well done or anything Last message sounds like breaking off contact, doesn't it? I can't say I like it. I can't say I like it at all. There's a funny smell to it. Something's not quite right. It's because we're slightly concerned for your welfare that we're having this conversation. I'm not sure now that it's safe for you to go back. Of course... If it was made worth my while... The financial terms have already been agreed. Also the matter of the free pardon The Distinguished Service Order - no. I happen to wear it myself when I'm in uniform. I'm a snob about whoever else should wear it. If you do go back now, it will be on my terms. The day of the private war of Eddie Chapman has come to an end. Are you with me? - I'm not sure I'm WITH you, but I'm beginning to get what you have in mind. It's 600ft down in the sea, between the rocks and it eats mainly small fish and it's also fond of human flesh....and crabs. So far, you've had it pretty good. You've been working for this Von Grunen - a Gentleman of the old school But you're NOT working for a Gentleman now. You've got to make up your mind who's going to win this war God help you if anything goes wrong and the Germans get to London. They'll find tons of official and secret documents All in beautiful crumbling ashes. And In a convenient fireplace in MI-5, they'll stumble across the half-burnt dossier of Edward Arnold Chapman. That half will be enough to get a rope round your neck or a bullet through your brain within the hour. I really don't know what's happened to the British sense of Justice. Well, all right. Now, remember the first 5,000. And no checks. Hmm? Fine. Now all We have to do is get you back to the Germans in the best possible condition. Now, The first time they said, you get your treatment. I told you, it was... It was beaa........ - And the time of the train? - Just before six. I told you. Corridor or no corridor? - None, as I remember. - I want a definite answer. No corridor. Look, I'm tired now. I've got to get some sleep. Give him another drink - that should wake him. You'll take over in half an hour. That film you saw the first night in London? A pretty girl called... Sally, uhhh... Grey and Anton Walbrook and er... Warsaw Concerto, that was the name, something like that. - Which cinema? - Marble Arch. And the color of your railway ticket from Rigbys to London? White - No, No, No - You bloody fool...Green! White's for first-class. There aren't any first class on the local railways. One mistake like that with the real boys and you'll be a goner. Ohh.. Please, I've been here for days. 15 hours and they'll keep you 30 at a stretch Make him finish the bottle. Grill him for another four hours, If he survives that I think it will be safe for him to catch the ship tomorrow night. Gentlemen, Thank You for your help You've taught me one thing - Never let the Poles take you prisoner. And Chapman, In case we never meet again, I'm relying on you to do a good job. After all, you do represent a considerable investment. - HE GROANS - Now, sugar ration - - How many ounces a week? - Oh! - I adore you! - Why? Because you never, never change. Listen, I don't have time for even backchat today. It was you in the black car? Yes. I had to reach you before Schnapps or Keller did. Where's von Grunen? On the Russian front Russia? Why? They are those who say it was your doing. Ahhhh! - Senor? Una manzanilla, por favor Alright, What am I being blamed for now? Well, Three of our best people in England Were liquidated within days of your arrival there. The arm of coincidence can't be that long. You do follow what I am saying? Oh Yes, I am listening. You'll be interrogated today and tomorrow and the day after. I hope your story's good It is Neither of us can be safe unless Von Grunen is brought back You are the only one who can do it. How do I go about that? Isn't there some valuable piece of information that you can give ONLY to Von Grunen? - No. But he owes me a hell of a lot of money. Can you prove that? It's in the contract. As soon as they are satisfied with your story at the chateau, I might get the right people by telephone. Agente Provocatrice! Hey, you're working too hard. Why? Does it show? Why don't you stop? This is a man's game. Yes, I will stop. One must stop, sometimes. At the moment, I have to be clever. Let's both be clever. This way. Come in. You are Franz Grauman? Unless you're the military attache, no I'm not. Whatever I am is not your business. You will please go over to that table and write down the whole of your activity from the moment you landed in England. You will omit nothing. I must say, You both seem overjoyed to see me. Of course we are. Welcome back. There's only one Franz Grauman He's the man alright. No, He hasn't changed, not one bit. At least life will be more gay at the chateau now he's come back. Just when we had given him up forever. Given me up? I never thought you'd dare come back to us after all that has happened. Well, why not? It takes courage to do what you are doing now. Walking directly into the lion's den like this. Well... I've come back for my money. What money? The 100,000 marks the baron owes me. - Who is unfortunately no longer with us. Who, Unfortunately may no longer be with anybody. The Casualties on the Eastern Front are appalling so they tell me. Colonel Steinhager, This is defeatist talk. Yes, all right. After all Everybody knows that our glorious armed forces are winning victory after victory on the Eastern Front. In Fact only a few more such triumphs and we shall be fighting in the streets of Berlin itself. Colonel Steinhager, Please... Yes, in the meantime put down on paper your experiences in England. It should make fascinating reading. Omitting nothing You've got a lot of time? Oh yes, We have time. After all, time is on our side... Isn't it? Now the possibility of political asylum for you has been lost, Franz. We have crossed the border. I don't know quite what you're getting at Keller. You were in neutral territory. Now you're not. Franz, come on Eddie Good luck - Heil Hitler - Heil Hitler Heil Hitler For you Oh, yes They are waiting They have been waiting quite a time. They don't like to wait Come on!.........Grauman Now What is it, huh? Is there somewhere I can...? There's a Bathroom through there Grauman! Franz, Open this door! All right What's the matter with you? You look terrible. It's the long ride, no food I suppose. Drink this A man must put something into his stomach I know someone who was just about to. Here Alright Gentlemen, that is about all for now. We shall discuss this later If you take these papers Franz Herr Field Marshall Rundstedt, May I present to you Lieutenant Special Service Franz Grauman? They told me your story. I've been looking forward to meeting you. Read it "To Lieutenant Special Service Franz Grauman "for successful achievements on behalf of the Bureau of Intelligence of the German Army, culminating in an exploit that resulted in the destruction of a large part of the Vickers Aircraft factory in England "At Great personal risk, and requiring specialised skills. Your award is made herewith of the Iron Cross Second Class. "In the name of the Fuhrer, Adolf Hitler. "It is worthy of further notice that Franz Grauman is the first Englishman to become the recipient of this honored decoration." In the name of the Fuhrer, Adolf Hitler. Now that you have been promoted to Lieutenant, I think the first thing you need is a visit to my tailor, and a different uniform. That's very kind of you, Sir. Is there anything else you want? Anything else I can do for you? Well, yes, I... I don't quite know how to put it. There is, actually. There most certainly is. We're very glad to see you back with us, Sir No need to make speeches I'm glad to be back. Alberr, Your buttons need shining. I think that includes all my personal documents. These are the files on the general administration. Thank you, Steinhager. I'm sorry to make you clear everything out my first day back. But I think It's better to start off the way I intend to continue. How did you get a hold of this? - What? - This aerial photo. What is it an aerial photo of, Franz? Tell us. And where have you seen it before? Hmm? ... Tell us. It's the Vickers factory of course. Look, I spent four days learning the layout, looking at pictures... in this very room. I've seen it before No, Franz. Pictures, drawings, but not aerial photographs. And certainly not aerial photographs of a factory on fire. Don't you think you have made a dangerous little slip-up this time? Hmm? Don't you? My English friend Oh, give over Steinhager, You're getting as nutty as Keller. Must be a Occupational disease... Once a policeman, always a policeman. Is that how the saying goes? Yes and it doesn't make me angry, as you would like it to. I am proud of being a policeman and grateful. Because We policeman have to be kept on no matter what regime is in power. Whether Germany is ruled by an emperor or communists or national socialists, The State needs policemen and the policeman now who is asking you one more question! Hurry it up, then! You said, "How on earth did you get hold of this?!" That's Right. As if it were surprising for us, the Germans, to have this picture. Why ask that, If you had seen this picture before when you were studying with the Baron here? Why?............WHY!!! It's meant to be of the highest security rating, kept in a wall safe and all that. Only the Baron, the projectionist and Myself were allowed to see them. Now they're flogging them around for one and all to see. No wonder I'm surprised. Until the Baron returned today, I was in charge of Abwehrstelle Ast! I wasn't one and all. Oh Franz, you disappoint me. You disappoint me that you cannot think of anything better! Steinhager...if you feel so strongly that you have a case against Grauman Then you must make a formal charge Press for an investigation. But if you are wrong... it will be your responsibility. Are you willing to take the risk? What would be the use? Franz seems to have friends in...high places. No, it's just that I am disappointed professionally. Cruelly disappointed That is the first time I feel sympathy for that man. And, of course, he is right... He's bound to survive. - Why him? - He's doing his job... He enjoys it. That's what makes him dangerous. Ah, well, Baron... Welcome home! This certainly is not the German Army that conquered Poland, Norway and France in less than one year of war. No, it certainly isn't. Strange. I am part of this army... and yet I like to think of myself as a pacifist. I'm a pacifist myself. I wonder, Eddie... all the time I wonder... What you really are. Helene, a packet of Gauloises, s'il vous plait. More champagne, I think, don't you? Garcon! I'm afraid I'll have to leave you. Those friends of mine in the corner, I can not keep them waiting any longer. Fearfully top army echelon Are they? Bring him another bottle and when he has finished that, put him in a taxi and send him to his hotel. - Yes. I'll see you in the morning. You look so sad and lonely. I'm a sad and lonely type darling. Then don't you think...? YOU push off. I was here first. - Bonsoir. - She doesn't belong here! - Run, don't walk. I know I'm late. I'm sorry. Your telegram was difficult to deliver. And now... Well, I have another name. - Oh. Legally. - Yes. My husband's name. - Why did you want to see me? - To ask you the time. And what else? Well...the last time I saw you, you had friends with you. Remember? Friends in the Resistance. I'm not trying to trap you, believe me. I need help. - Help from the French underground. I've got to... - < CHAMPAGNE CORK POPS - I must have radio communication with England. - I can't possibly... You don't have to admit to anything, just listen. Suppose you knew someone in the Resistance... and suppose he checked up on me with London...when he found out I was all right, he could contact me. If I knew such people, what would you want to tell them? Take a look at that table in the corner. One of those generals is Field Marshall Von Kluge. The colonel with him is Von Grunen. Meaning what? Von Grunen is using me as a cover to attend that meeting over there. Today is Tuesday. I only buy books on Fridays and Saturdays. ..So the names really do mean something to you. Do me a favor, will you? Get me in touch with England by radio. And then do me another? Right afterwards... get out of this business. Deux cents francs, monsieur. At eight o'clock. At the bistro called Les Bons Nuits, rue Lamartine. Eight o'clock? Merci, monsieur. Let me know straight away. Well? We'll come back in a few minutes. Le rouge? Paulette? Bonsoir Raymond! Raymond! Coming .... Sherrie Can we talk here? Mmm... Nowhere safer Got me cleared with London? If you have something to say, I may be able to get it across there. You're taking an awful risk, talking like that. Openly. That's the secret. The trick Talk openly .... I can deny anything You have a grudge against me, maybe? Or you want me out of the way for some reason? Now, is there still something you want to tell me? I could've used somebody like you back in the good old days. I'll tell you fast. 21st Panzer and the 19th Light have arrived in France. How do you know? The generals were at dinner Here in Paris, on Tuesday night. Something pretty funny going on among those generals. The regular army ones, I mean. It involves a senior officer on the general... I might have known. Keller! I'm surprised to see you here Disreputable dive like this I'm not surprised to see YOU, however. Everybody seems to have his hands in his pockets. - HE TUTS - What is it, a raid or something? But you take your hands OUT of your pocket. Bit jumpy, aren't you, Keller? What seems to be bothering you? Cigarette? You are under arrest. Oh, Keller, You really need your head examined! I received your telephone message. I came as soon as I could. Well I'm Sorry that I disturbed you, it turns out it was a false alarm. Put your gun away. And you...? What are you doing here? It's just a coincidence. He and his friends happened to walk in. Isn't that right Keller? As Grauman says, Sir... A false alarm. I don't know what's happening here, but I intend to find out. It had better be important enough to take me from a dinner with the Colonel General! Go Back to your hotel. - Stay there until I send for you. - Yes, sir. You have a rendezvous tomorrow evening. I wouldn't like to see you miss it. Now it's you! A telephone message. It's from you? Better ask Grauman! He seems to be the only one who knows what's going on. Night, all. Leave your coat here. I'll sign for both of us. .. Good Evening! Ah, my dear cousin, so THIS is your celebrated protege. - Good evening, gentlemen. - Fuhrer! How's your father? Haven't seen him for years! Is he keeping well? Quite well, sir. - We must all keep well! Colonel General, may I present Lieutenant Special Services, Franz Grauman. Good evening. - Heil Hitler! - Mm. Extraordinary how things have changed, isn't it? Instead of "Heil Hitler", he grunts. - Colonel Steinhager! - Ja? Nobody is to go in or out until the meeting is quite over. No exceptions, sir? No exceptions, That's an order. Looks like we're in for a very rough night, my friends! I say no, no and no. The last mission was entirely for the benefit of the Luftwaffe. This time the Kriegsmarine must have a chance! - I say Grauman belongs to the Army! The Navy is the senior of all the services! Yes, and the smallest. My dear Admiral, and esteemed friend, your argument is very weak. This meeting is going to last a week. Shan't sleep for a week as it is! My God, the Luftwaffe are going to bomb the Navy! OUR Navy! I have already submitted it to They're beginning to run out of steam already. I am just waiting for the right moment. Lower your voices! You can be heard halfway across Paris! General Schuler is in there! I demand he receives this message! My entire career could be destroyed! An SS general being refused to be allowed to receive an important communique?! You heard our instructions! I'm sorry Sir but I must insist ! Insist?! You INSIST?! Sit down at once! I may not be the SS, but by God, I will see a court-martial break you for disobeying my orders! Give it to me. 4:30...... Any minute now Then it doesn't look as though that is going to work out either. The only solution for this is a mission for Grauman that will have something for each of them. So it seems! Have you a suggestion? In England Colonel General, near Portsmouth, Five heavy bomber stations are airfields for quite specific targets in Germany. Planes from Lakenheath always bomb Hamburg. And Manston has Berlin for a target. What is needed is a man in the Portsmouth area who could... Exactly Colonel, A man to radio us with the news of which airfield the bombers come from. Exactly. The Luftwaffe could then concentrate its night fighters over the target area. From the High Command Intelligence, Bulletin number 317 We have reports of another American army being formed in England Possibly to be commanded by General Patton In the same Portsmouth area Identify this US 3rd Army successfully, And I promise that We can arrange something a little more interesting than Iron Cross work! Gentlemen, this suggestion of Colonel von Grunen is inspired! We've been talking for hours at cross purposes And now we have a plan of action For our valuable English associate. Have you no comment to make on this? When am I going to get any sleep? - LAUGHTER - Right now because I am going to bed. Open the windows, please. We need some fresh air. When you see your father, He was my divisional commander you know- Tell him from me that his son will most certainly equal his achievements. I'll tell him Colonel General Thank you It's difficult to be both a soldier and a diplomat. Good night or Good morning rather, Gentlemen. General Schuler Yes Your orders were that you were not to be disturbed, Sir. You carried out your orders well. But These messages they are important, Sir They are very important, Sir !! I can tell you what it is. The Allies... THE ALLIES HAVE LANDED IN NORMANDY!!!! - HE LAUGHS - Anything wrong? No, It all seems in order. The only thing is the money must be in a Swiss bank in dollars, all 100,000 of them. Well, I can't blame you... We've lost the war now. It's only a matter of time. - Sh-sh-sh. - Microphones. No-one cares any more. Everybody says it. Hitler has been interfering so much with the army strategy, Von Rundstedt has asked to be replaced. - Von Kluge is taking over. - Ah, who was in the night club with you I didn't tell you it was Von Kluge. Some time ago, that remark of yours might have got you into a lot of trouble. Now, who cares? Your copy of the signed contract. They're not serious about sending me on this job, are they? V1s and V2s, that's all the madman has left up his sleeve. Secret weapons How far are they? About 35 miles. American Third Army will be here in less than a week. Well, I'll be in Paris tomorrow. Anything I can get you? No. I have an aircraft waiting. It's an important journey for me. Your radio frequencies. - What was that? Your radio frequencies. You'll memorise them before you leave. Oh, I'll learn them. Wish I was going with you. The Countess going back to Sweden, You to England, the place won't be the same. Not with the American and British soldiers around, it won't. I mean't.....Abwehrstelle Ast Did you see that? Free French. Yeah, I'm not particular. Damn it, We're running late. I want to celebrate my last night in Paris. When it ends, and it will end, what will you do? - If I survive? - Oh, you'll survive. As I will. We're both professional survivors. Well In that case, I'll just go on doing what I like best. Which is? Looking at pretty things. If you ever go to Sweden... It Wouldn't work. Well ....... We could try. Oh... Are we too much alike? Let's just say... We're very much alike. Steinhager's here. Vous restez, monsieur? What? Can we stop dancing? I don't enjoy it with him watching. - Table? - No, no. Ah! Charming! Charming! It makes my heart feel young again just to watch you. First you'll have to steal a heart. Tsk, tsk, tsk. Franz... And the last time we shall be together, huh? You've come for me rather early. They are getting anxious at the airfield, and no Von Grunen. Do you know where he is? Come on. - You coming? - I've had too many farewells in my time. I'll miss you, Helga. It's nice to know you remember my name. I WILL miss you. Just go.... I'll have a little more wine. Ah, Keller! I was worried about you. I thought they'd sent you to the Russian front. If I were you, I would be more worried about myself. Oh, I didn't know you cared ! Colonel, They say fog is closing in. So as soon as you're ready... Yes, We are coming. I must say I'd like to have seen the Baron. So would we all. Achtung! Achtung! This is an important announcement. The Fuhrer is well. The Fuhrer is not dead as reported a few minutes ago by a few German traitors...'My Gott! who had seized Radio Stuttgart illegally. There has been an attempt on the life of our glorious Fuhrer by some treacherous senior officers. 'But in less than one hour, the Fuhrer himself will be speaking to you on this station. 'Stay tuned to this station.' Now I suppose that cancels MY trip. There's no order cancelling your departure.. Grauman must wait Oh, come on, make up your minds. You heard what the pilot said. That's right! Grauman's mission is urgent. I do not see why this group of filthy traitors should in anyway affect you. Come on - the cars are waiting. Be ready as soon as I send for you. Look after yourself, Steinhager. I don't want to come back and find you listed as missing in action. Always the joker, Franz! Always the joker. Franz! There's one thing I must ask you. Are you...? I know - I heard. - Already? - On the radio. We're doomed When the aristocracy of the German army cannot even blow up one single room at a given time, We deserve to lose Ja, danke schon, danke schon. Later! Look, Eddie! Look, Eddie! Tell me one thing. I have to know for myself. You ARE a British agent, aren't you? AREN'T you? When did you guess? Colonel Von Grunen, you are under arrest. I resist arrest, Steinhager. You resist arrest, Sir? You know what your orders are, If I resist arrest I command you to carry out your orders! It wasn't necessary Somebody else would have done it for us Aerial reconnaissance is practically out of existence, but thanks to your security, The German high command have no idea where the V1s are landing or what effect they're having on the British people. My mission is to report the exact time and position of each explosion, so they can correct their aim and drop the maximum load on London. You mean They don't know what a hell of a time they've been giving us?! Well, Gentlemen, let's call the backroom boys together and work out a plan. We can supply the Germans with information AND at the same time divert all their secret weapons. 1500 hours. Five bombs - 51 degrees, 15 minutes north, 0 degrees, 10 minutes west. Pass to you for translating into decoy information. False reading as follows - 51 degrees, 7 minutes north, 0 degrees, 5 minutes west. That should fool them all right. Now, put this up on the board. There you are. Good evening, Braid. Evening, Sir.... Everything's in order. Parker! How's it going? I THINK we're pulling it off, Sir. The bombs all seem to be gradually moving north. Let's cheer them up. Let's tell them that one was Selfridge's. Smithson 37 Beautiful model! Three minutes to crack that back in the old days. Those were the OLD days. Now that you've got your free pardon here, You'd better keep it that way. Have you got the Molyneux robbery down and the post office at Bromley? Hey! Where's my record? There's nothing here at all! This doesn't make the pardon legal. It's legal alright! Read it! Anything before 1945 - You're in the clear. I'd better be! Now that it's all over, I can tell you something else. Your own criminal record - your dossier - went up in the Blitz. What? Would you say that again. A bomb dropped on the records office - everything A to E written off! You mean...before I landed here the first time? You mean I went through all this...? I risked my life...! Oh, why the hell did I get mixed up in all this anyway? Say, Eddie...? - Mmm? Tell us something. Which side were you REALLY on? You mean you don't know?
