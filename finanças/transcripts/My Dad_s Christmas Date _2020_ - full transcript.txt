Come on. What yo... I was enjoying that. - I definitely wasn't. - Come on. That is a Christmas classic. - Yeah, it was doing my head in. - Oh, come on. Anything but this. - Mm-mm. - Please. Jules. - Julia. Please. - No. Mm-mm. All right. Dad, seriously? Finally. Now she responds. Do not call me "she." Anything exciting going on in school today? - Nothing. - What about choir? - Hmm. - All right. - Politics? - Seriously? We both know there's absolutely no point having an opinion on politics. - Why is that? - Because no matter who you vote for, the country's still going to go to shit, so it's completely pointless. Where di... Where did you get that from? Miss Garver. - Miss Garver? - Yeah. - Miss Garver... - Yeah. ...and I are going to have a little heart to heart. Dad, I am entitled to my own opinion. Yeah, but, honey, that's not your opinion, that's her opinion. You're just being pedantic now. I think you mean I'm being patronizing. - This is exactly why I hate speaking to you. - Why? Because you ask me a question, I answer it, - and then you just take great delight in just... - Honey, I... - ...picking the answer apart. - I... I want you to embrace your opinion, honey. I just don't want you - to take everything at face value. - Well, I'm not! Just because it's Miss Garver's opinion, doesn't mean that I don't agree with it, and I think, "Yeah, you know what? You're right, Miss Garver." No, no, I... Listen, honey, that's not what I said, okay? - I... I didn't said... - It's what you meant, exactly what you meant. - What's that? - But that's what you said, though. That's... that's exactly what you said. What I meant was, I want you to feel comfortable to question things. Just because I'm a woman, I can't think for myself, right? This has nothing to do with you being a woman. You know that, come on. - Right. Mm-hmm. - It doesn't. Well, I'm sorry that I attempted to have a conversation at all. Why, I never asked you to speak to me, did I? Well, lesson learned. Gripes and pet peeves, folks. 020-7946-7946. We've already heard from Tom in Copley, and Harriet in Birmingham, about her pavement pizza on a Saturday night. And now, we've got a message from Jules, in York, who says, "My dad talks like a sexist pig. How do I get him to leave me alone?" That is an easy one, Jules. Quite simply, tell your dad to... ♪ Jingle bells, jingle bells jingle all the way ♪ ♪ Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh ♪ ♪ Let there be love ♪ So, how are we getting on, Miss Evans? We're fine, Mr. Thompson. No worries or concerns? - No. - It's just that your, um... marks have dropped a bit this term. Actually, quite a lot. Uh, I know your situation is, um... singular. But I was wondering if your work is suffering because of the... long-term implications of your... mother's... - Death. - Yes. - No. - Good. Bi... biscuit? I'm all right. - Shall I go? - Yeah. I don't see why they get so much hate. They were madly in love. They remained devoted to one another despite forced marriages to other people, war, injury. And they died in each other's arms. It's a classic romance. But Cersei and Jaime were twins. A technicality. Bitch table. Speaking of romance, have you told your dad about lover boy? No, because he'd have a stroke. He's going to find out sometime. Not if I can help it. What if you get pregnant? Can't get pregnant if you don't have sex, Em. Tell that to the Virgin Mary. She was just minding her own business, - milking some goat in Iran. - Israel. That's the one. Then bam! She's carrying the son of God. It may take him seven days to create the world, but he can knock you up with the click of his fingers. I'll bear that in mind. So, what are we going to do about your poor dad? He must be lonely. And also, he's really fit. Em! That is my dad you're talking about. He spends his Monday nights in a church. Yeah, well, that was his thing with Mom. Doesn't exactly scream social life, though, does it? If you're so desperate to play Cupid, why don't you set your brother up? I would, but by some miracle, he's got himself a girlfriend. Oh, my God, I've got it. We should set your dad up with someone. That is really creepy. Oh, before I forget. Speaking of moms, I was thinking of getting this for Mom. Cute, right? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I think she'll really like it. ♪ King Wenceslas last looked out on the Feast of Stephen ♪ ♪ When the snow lay round about deep and crisp and even ♪ That's all right. Congratulations, you are officially the world's worst father. Thank you, appreciate that. It's not funny, by the way. It is a bit. You know, there was a time when Jules was happy to see me. And now, she looks at me, like, "Say one more word and I will castrate you with this crossbow." Oh, come on, David. No, no. She's like, "Enough of your white privilege, okay, Daddy? You take it down a little bit, or me and the rest of my cellmates will shank you." God's sake, David, she's 16, not six. What do you expect? I mean, Jules is being pumped full of so many hormones that, at this stage, she's closer to the Incredible Hulk than Bruce Banner. So, what's the cure? Menopause. Problem solved, thank you. I'll just fast forward 70 years, and everybody wins. Success. - Oh, Je... - How about this? - What? - Why don't you talk to her? Uh... How do you plan to sell that idea? "Uh, here's my ex-girlfriend, whom your mom never really liked, to talk to you about life and the many difficulties of womanhood." Claire loved you. She did. - She loved you like the plague. - So, didn't. Oh, dear. You're right, she hated you. She hated you. No, it's just a phase, you know? She'll get through it. - When? - Look, okay, at least your relationship with Jules is nowhere near as bad as your love life. I know you've put on a few pounds - since we dated. But, uh... - Really? ...surely you can pay someone to date you. There you go. I'm trying to remember why we're friends. - I'm coming up empty. No, there's no reason. - Because... Because I know how to make you feel just bad enough that you consider changing yourself, but not so bad that you spunk your daughter's inheritance on a Porsche. This has been a very special kind of torture. Oh, my God, it's time to go. I'm late for my daughter's rehearsal. I love you. I am going to go be a good father. You're a great life coach, said no one. ♪ And the running of the deer ♪ ♪ The playing of the merry organ ♪ ♪ Sweet singing in the choir ♪ ♪ Oh, the rising of the sun ♪ ♪ And the running of the deer ♪ Jules, concentrate.

Merry Christmas, babe. "Mr. and Mrs. Evans request the pleasure of inviting you to share the joy of their wedding celebration." Um... Please, don't hate me for this, Dad. How many sites are there? Okay. A lot. A lot of sites. "City Mingles." "Next Flame." Whoo, 40-pound membership. That's a lot. "Down to Date." Hmm. What I'm hearing is, "Emma, you're a genius. I never should've doubted you." I don't know where you heard that, but you definitely need your ears tested. You look like my aunt. Right. You're the one who said setting your dad up was creepy. Yeah, because it still is. - Then, what's changed? - Um, I don't know. I just think he needs to try something new. Right. Have you thought about how we're going to do it? Uh, yeah. I'm working on it. - You like these? - Oh, yeah! I love that. Definitely. Okay. Well, I better get ready for my date. - Are you excited? - Um... Yes. - How you doing? - I'm all right. "Though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains and have not charity, I am nothing." Do you feel more rested now, my dear? - I do. - Bless your dear little heart. Alice. You know me, darling. I never thought there was anyone like you left in the whole wide world. Cut me throat, rip me liver if I'm telling a lie. This is the happiest Christmas I ever had. Hi, Dad. Hey. How was the movie? - It was all right. - It was good? You've a good time with Emma? Yeah, I think so. Can I just ask you some questions? It's for this survey at school. Shoot. Dad. - Go ahead. - Dad, please, look. It will literally take, like, two seconds. - Okay. All right. - That's all I need. - Make it quick, though. - Okay. Uh, so, your height and weight? Five feet nine inches, 175 pounds. There we go. Uh, exercise habits, if any? Um, I, um, I sprint to the refrigerator and eat buckets of lard. Fair enough. Uh, do you drink frequently? Uh... Yes. Yes, you do. - Take it easy. - That's easy. Regularly. How about the last book you read? - What's that? - Last book you read? Um... Uh, John Grisham, and it was the one that was made into the movie. Come back to it. Languages? I speak English. - Okay. - Fluently. - Good. - Navigate it really well. English. Also, um, I speak Au... Australian and South African. Okay. Uh, interests or hobbies? Uh, I like, uh, - drama-free children. - Mm-hm. Yeah. Uh, yeah, are you kidding? Uh, hobbies. Um, well, you know, I like, uh, naps, music, falling asleep in public. Arts, none of the modern stuff, um... - Yeah. - That's it. Got you. - Um... Oh. - The Reckoning. That's what it was. That's the name of the book. Occupation? - In-house counsel, Whiting Enterprises. - Lawyer. And what kind of income would you get for that kind of... Wha... What is this for? Um, it's just like a survey for secondary school children's parents in England and Wales. Oh, okay, in that case, last book, uh, I read was War and Peace, for the 16th time. Yeah. I have it memorized. Uh, I speak 11 languages. - What kind of languages? - Uh, I speak Thai, Mandarin, of course. Punjabi. Yiddish. - Do you want to give me a little basic show? - Yeah. Don't be meshuggeneh, bubeleh. Wow. All right? My little shiksa goddess. Please, never do that again, that's just embarrassing. That's just Hebrew. - Okay. - Okay? Get used to it. Thanks for that. - Okay, I think we're done. We're done. - We're done? - Are you sure? - Yeah. Okay, you might want to read those back to me if I've trouble sleeping tonight. Because it feels like the cure for insomnia, those questions. Thank you, Dad. I hope you got what you needed. - I did. Right. - All right. - Night. - Shalom. "To anyone expecting a glimpse of a... half-naked handsome hunk..." You're out of luck. Whilst you won't get to enjoy washboard abs, what you will get is a fun-loving father who loves to smile. And, in the interest of honesty, I am obviously American, I know how you Brits love to hate us. I just wanted to get that out there. I love art and classical music, in an unpretentious way. I'm not big on messaging. My daughter says it's because I'm out of touch. I am challenged tech... with technology. I'm technolog... I'm... I'm just challenged all around. I truly believe that you never really know someone until you're sitting across from them. So please, don't be put off if I ask to meet you early on. I lost my wife in a car crash two years ago. A piece of my heart will always be with her. This is something I cannot help and will not apologize for. "But there's plenty left to share with someone else if they give me the chance." It's good, Jules. I mean, really, really good. - You think? - Yeah. Have you uploaded it? No. I'm still not sure about this, Em. Fair enough. Crisp? Yep. Whoops. You bitch. Okay, well, what now? We wait. Jules! How much longer? We got to get going. Jules! Jules! Jules! We got to get going, come on. We got to get there before it gets dark. Dad! Five minutes! I hate being late. - Why are we doing this? - Because Aunt Tammy and Uncle George are family. Will Jeremy be here? Probably, yeah. - Oh, no. - Listen, don't make a scene. Don't do it. Just let's get through it, and then we don't have to see them until next year, all right? - Promise? - Yeah. And remember, we're happy to be here. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas. So good to see you both, if a little later than expected. Oh, David, you shouldn't have. Come in. Come in. Wipe your feet. Carpet's new. Sorry. Sorry. And what do you do, dear? I'm at school. I beg your pardon? I'm at school, I said. Save me. - Happy Christmas, Clive. - Happy Christmas, George. Good to see you again. Hey, it's appalling, isn't it, what's going on in Syria. Oh, heartbreaking. All those families ripped apart. - Yeah, it's ter... - Children orphaned. Aye, he's not wrong, David. You're right. Whereabouts? In York. I beg your pardon? I'm at school in York! I tell you, we really must - do more here. - Absolutely. What time should we tee off in the morning? - I was thinking nine. - That's a good time, yeah. Yeah, to get there before the scumbags do. Scumbags? All the people from the Estate. And what do you do in York? And we'll be finished in time for lunch. - You staying? - Oh, that's a good idea. Have you tried the smoked salmon? Can't eat it. Can't, it makes me sick. Last time I was on the toilet for four hours. Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah. Like mother, like daughter. - Excuse me? - It's for your own good, darling. No niece of mine will grow up a drunken bimbo. How's the rugby going this year, Jeremy? Fantastic. We're looking to get promoted, and I'm hoping to turn semi-pro. How exciting! And Eleanor has an interview at Oxford next week. - Which college? - Oriel. How about you, Jules? - What have you been up to? - School. And any exciting plans for the future? No, nothing. You better get thinking. Don't want to let the family down. Oh, show them your tattoo. He's designed it himself. Who knew you had such a talented son? What does it mean? Excuse me. - You couldn't take the snobbery as well, huh? - Yeah. Just a heads up, though, you might get a call - from Aunt Tam in the morning. - Oh, no, no, no. Jules, what are you talking... What did I tell you? I can't help it, she was being a bitch. Don't say that, come on. Dad, don't be a hypocrite. - You hate her as much as I do. - I... Yes, but I don't call her a bitch at her own Christmas party. Was Mom an alcoholic, Dad? Who said that? Was she? No, of course not. She liked to drink, but she wasn't an alcoholic. She hated these things. You remember when she dressed up as a pirate? - You remember that? - Yeah. Tammy was fuming. "You said the dress code was fancy." She had them whole, she committed. - It was great. - Peg leg and then, "You said the dress code was fancy." - One of her best lines. - Yeah. Want to go back inside? Yeah. I'll be in in a sec.

You can see what the artist is trying to do, expressing her deep despair at the state of modern society. But it's not tormented enough to move me. Not caustic enough in its critique of our innately selfish culture, careering as it does towards catastrophe. And, so, fails completely to depict this bastion of human consumption. Don't you agree?

I was just going to second base with my boyfriend, and I just didn't want anyone to hear. Of course you were. Listen, dinner's on the table... What's that supposed to mean? - That I got takeout on the way home from work. - No, no, no, no. Oh, you don't think I can get a boyfriend, do you? I didn't say that, Jules. - It's what you meant, though. - No. Honey, you know, I've had a really long day, - and I... I can't even have this... - So just tell me what you meant. Because you don't have a boyfriend. Because you never mentioned a boy, all right? And I've never seen you with a boy. Let's cross the boyfriend bridge when we get to it. How, why, who? Hi... Don't look at me. Look down. I'm telling you, the whole thing was a nightmare. What did you say? What could I say? I...

Oh, okay, well. You know, she's a young woman. And as long as she's careful - and it's her choice, so... - What should I do? You've got to listen to her and try not to overreact. She's got a boyfriend, not a criminal record. David, look, uh, I've got to go. - I'm at the office. - Yeah, no, thank you. I appre... I've taken up enough of your time. - Thank you, Sara. - Speak soon. All right. Oh. Um... All right? Yeah, yeah. You? - Yes, good, yeah. - Good, good. - Are they ready to... - Yes, sure, sure.

Okay. So... Bye, Daddy, bye. Did you have fun? - Yeah, we made cookies. - Cookies? Oh, I bet it wasn't as good as our Victoria sponge, eh? - I think they were better. - Better? You chee... cheeky monkey! "I've got to come clean." I messed up. No. This is just stupid now. I hate chocolate. Okay. Asking him to grow balls as well is a bit harsh. My dad's not a dickhead. Will you, please, go for a coffee with him? Yes, yes, yes! - You want to share a slice of cake? - Um... - No. No, I'm good, I'm good, thanks. - No? All right, then. Listen, Jules, I just want to let you know - that I completely respect... - No, - don't go there, please. - Your... I haven't said anything. You were going to ask me about Ben, though, weren't you? - Well, I... Thank you. - Thank you. I wasn't going to ask details, okay? - No. I'm not having this conversation with you. - No, no, I just... We're not having any conversation, I promise you. Literally, you just tell me one thing about the guy, I won't say a word. So, it's not a conversation. - No. - You... I don't even know where the guy lives. - You want to intimidate him, do you? Scare him a bit? - No, I... - Maybe I want to send him a Christmas card. - Oh, no, Dad, please, don't you dare. That's so embarrassing. - Well, Jules, look at me, I'm not... - Dad. No. - That's just embarrassing for me. Seriously. - I'm not asking... What is... what kind of classes does the guy like? - Does he have a passion for origami? Does he... - I'm not telling you anything. - Was he born a boy? - I'm not telling you anything, - so you might as well just drop it. - Why not? Because it's none of your business. It is my business. I'm your father. Oh, you think because one of your sperm fertilized one of Mom's eggs, - you think you have the right... - Oh, my God. ...to stick your nose into every single nook and cranny of my personal life?

No, I actually dare you! Do it, ban me from seeing Ben. Use this mystical power bestowed on you because of your crazy amazing sperm and ban me from seeing my boyfriend. Why... why do you have to be so dramatic? - What's the point? - Why do you want to know about Ben? - Do you think he's a psychopath or something? - He might be! I don't know anything about him!

I got into drama school. - Where? - Tisch School of the Arts. So, why didn't you go? Well, we didn't have the money. Didn't grandpa pay for it? Well, grandpa... his particular brand of parenting was this strange mix of support and business. Wasn't very wealthy, but everything that he had, money, time, he put into me and your Uncle Ray. You know, private schools, tuition, everything. He used to drive Ray hundreds of miles for baseball games. And then, the moment Ray blew his shoulder out... the rides dried up overnight. You know, so... I went to him, I asked for money for drama school. He looked me in the eyes, he said, "David, the bottomless pit that is your education has finally found the floor." Took me years to realize how great that line was. So, if you... couldn't afford drama school, how did you got to law school? No, he paid for that. How come? Well, there was a return on his investment. Wow. He was a great man, though. He was a really great man. It saddens me all the time that you never had a chance to meet him. Or he, you. Now, I never want you to sacrifice your dreams because of me. All right? Morning, Tom. - Morning, David. - Morning, David. Morning, team. How's everyone doing? - You had a great weekend? - Yeah, good. Where are we with the Sanderson suit? Still nothing. It's been nearly a week since we made our offer. All right, well, listen, if they don't call us by noon, we ring them back and we tell them every hour we wait, we're going to drop our number two percent. Can't let this thing drag on any longer. - What about the Callaghan suit? - They're refusing to budge. - They won't sign unless we... - What the hell? Is everything all right? Boss, I've got Sanderson on the line. Not now! Uh, boss, it's Sanderson. Not now. He'll have to call you back. ♪ Midwinter ♪ ♪ Frosty wind made moan ♪ ♪ Our God heaven cannot hold him ♪ ♪ Nor earth sustain ♪ ♪ Heaven and earth shall flee away ♪ ♪ When he comes to reign ♪ Dad? Dad? I'll walk home then. Okay. That's it! You're coming clean. Right now. - About what? - Everything. Okay, because that really narrows it down for me. Watch your mouth. Is this about Ben or something? I couldn't give two shits about big Ben. - Then, what is your problem? - My problem! You're flunking out of school! You belong to eight different dating sites? That's my problem! I thought you actually wanted to spend time with me. I'm an idiot. Talk to me. Thank you for taking so much time out of your busy schedule for me, okay? That's what you think this is about, work? You think I work those long hours for fun? No, you work them so you don't have to think about Mom! This has nothing to do with your mother. This has everything to do with Mom! Don't use her death as an excuse to do whatever you want. Getting Cs and Ds? You used to get As. And by the way, spending 300 pounds last month on dating sites for me? To be honest, I thought it was more than that. This isn't a joke. How do you know how much I spent? I looked at your bank statement. That is such an invasion of my privacy, Dad!

Important question. Yeah? Have you decided on what you're wearing to Sophie's party? Because if you haven't, pretty please, can I borrow your white strappy top? I think it'll go great with those jeans I got. Yeah, sure. Go for it. Thanks. Is Ben going to be there? Yeah, I think so. How are things with you two? Has he been over? Uh, yeah, he came over on Wednesday. Why didn't you tell me? It just didn't come up. For future reference, anything happens with any guy, you tell me immediately. Was he a good kisser? I guess so. Come on, you've got to give me more than that. Did you go any further? I don't want to talk about it, Em. You did! I can hear it in your voice. Look, just because you don't have a boyfriend doesn't mean that I've got to tell you every single detail about mine. I wouldn't want your boyfriend. Good, because he wouldn't want you. He's only going out with you because he's already screwed every girl in his year! Can't you see you're just a number to him? Don't you ever call me just a number again! So, Jules has been setting you up on dates - without your knowledge. - Pretty much. - Clever girl. - Yeah. - And so, this woman. - Yeah, Amanda. - Ah! Ow, son of a bitch. - Oh. - What is it? - I just got a cramp. - Oh! - Here. - Oh, my God. - How can I help? - Hold this, pull my leg. - Okay. - Just pull it. There you go. - All right. Oh. - Ah! - So. - Oh! - Tell me. - Yeah? - Is she intelligent? - Who? - Amanda. Oh. Yeah, she's fiercely intelligent. And attractive? From what I remember, yeah. So, where are you going to take her? Mm-mm. Nowhere. - Why not? - Uh, because it's just not the right time. Can you just... just pull? Ow! What are you doing? Ah. I'm divorcing Mike. What? Why didn't you tell me? - You didn't ask. - I'm not a mind reader. Do you know, this is why we could never work out! Because all you think about is your own problems, never anyone else! Sara. Hey. Come here. Sit down, please. Was he cheating on you? Was he having an affair? Don't be stupid. I mean, Mike could be a bit slow at times, but he's not insane. What about you? How could I? Spend all my free time nannying you. No, we're... The magic just died. At first, I told myself it was a rough patch. Then that I was sticking it out for the kids. In reality, it was... the thought of how it used to be that... kept me there for so long. Why are you telling me this now? Because sometimes... sometimes... it's best to enjoy memories for what they are... and move on. - Hello? - Hey, yeah, is that Amanda? Yeah, speaking. - It's David Evans. - Oh, hi, David! - It's so good to hear from you. - Yeah. Well, it's good to hear from you, too. Uh... Yeah, I... just wanted to know, you know, if that offer still stands, uh, you know, if you were up for maybe getting that drink Saturday. Yeah, sounds great, I'd love that. Ruby's Bar, seven o'clock? - Great. - Perfect. Okay. Yeah, I'll see you then. - See you Saturday. Bye, David. - All right. Okay. Oh, Amanda. How... Hey, oh... Hi. Shoot... I'm heading out. Oh, okay. Good luck. You look nice. Thank you. You need some money for a cab? No, it's okay. Sophie said we can stay over the night. You know what, I'll leave a 20 for you. - No, it's okay. - Just in case. You know what, I'll leave it on the kitchen counter. - All right. - Have fun. All right. "...or any other good old city, town, or borough in the good old world." And God bless us, everyone. - Mom? - Yeah? I think Daddy is missing you. What is that? Oh, Jes... - You okay, David? - Yeah. Oh, God. - I'm so sorry. Should I just try... - Oh, no, it's all right. - ...and come back and make more of an entrance? - It's okay. - Are you okay? - Uh, yeah. What's... my heart has actually exploded, but it'll, it'll calm down. - It's good to see you. - Yeah. Well, we're off to a great start. - I know. - I think that went really well. Yeah.

Bless your mama... - You're looking great, too, though. - No. I mean, how long has it been now? Seventeen years? Oh, my God. You were three years old. Hey, Jules. You know, Ben's a really good kisser. I don't know what to say, David, sorry. Why, what's going on? Well, it all feels a bit surreal. - What do you mean? - You, me... having a drink. Yeah. Well. You must have known I had a crush on you. No! I'd no idea. - No? - No. Is it a joke? - No, of course not. - Really? Never thought I had a chance, though. Are you serious? You've made my Christmas. Wow. Obviously, you've been married since. But, that girl you were dating? Catherine? Chloe? Claire. - Claire. Yes, Claire! - Yeah. I only met her a couple of times, but the way that you looked - to each other... - Yeah. ...I thought that was you off the market, for sure. Here I am. How is she? You know, I... I'd... I'd rather not talk about it. - Come on, David. - Actually, do you know what? Do you... How about another one? Yo... One more. David, you can tell me what happened. Well... what's it to you? Jeez, David. - What's it to me? - Yeah. Excuse me? She's everything that you're not. You know, you're beautiful and smart, and... But she... she could light up a room. She'd light up any room. And that's, uh, that's a gift that, you know, you nor anyone in here is blessed with. I'm sorry. I've got you. Dad? What's happened? I'd... What do you d... I thought you were going to be out later. Yeah, there was just a change of plans. Oh, okay. You use that 20 that I gave you? Yeah. Okay, did you say "thank you?" Thank you. - Do you want me to get a brush? - No, I'm fine, I got it. I'll take care of it. Just go t... go to bed. - No, it's fine, I'm up now. - No, I said go to bed! Just go to bed. Why are you being a dick? Because my daughter, per usual, is not listening to me. That's why. I just... - I just want to help. - I never asked for your help! With anything! - Dad, I... - It's not your job to decide if I'm lonely. - What about me, then? - What about you? It's not about you! For once! Sorry, mailbox is full. You have 158 new messages. To listen to new messages, press one. Hey, Mom. It's me, Jules. I don't know why I just said Jules, you should know it's me. Well, I hope you do. Maybe you've forgotten, I... I honestly don't really know why I called. I feel a bit stupid, to be honest with you. I just needed to hear your voice. Miss you. Hey, it's me. I know you never liked me swearing, but I need to vent. Right. Mrs. Edwards is a bitch. Yeah, she's an absolute bitch. I mean, I revised so hard for this test last week. And yeah, I messed it up, but she didn't have to call me out in front of the whole class and just humiliate me. If embarrassing teenagers is the only thing to make her feel powerful, then she must live a seriously sad existence. Shit, she's coming towards me right now. I... I think she must have heard. Got to go, Mom. Love you, bye. Hey, it's me. Um, you'll never guess what happened last night. So, I was in bed, just watching a film, right? When I get a text from this number I don't recognize. Turns out it's from a guy in the year above. He's called Ben, and we spoke a couple of times in lunch in the queue, but... or at the bus stop and stuff, but I never realized he, like, liked me, you know. Uh, long story short, we're going for coffee after school on Monday. You've got to promise me not to tell Dad any of this, by the way. He'll get all macho and threaten to break Ben's legs or something. Actually, saying that, he's probably more likely to invite him for tea which would be even worse. I think you'd like him, Mom. Anyway, that's my news. Love you. Bye. Hey, it's me. Everyone expects me to be fine, Mom. Everyone expects that after two years, my life is now back to normal, but I'm not fine, Mom. Mom, I'm not fine. And my life is definitely not back to normal, and I don't even know what normal is anymore. No one understands me, Mom. Not any of my teachers, not Em, not Dad. Dad has never understood me. He never has and he never will. Why did you have to leave me here? Because I can't do it by myself. You have no new messages. How'd you know? Cellphones are an amazing thing... for worried parents or... or a complete stalker. - You cold? Let me give you my coat. - No, it's fine. I just needed to speak to someone, Dad. I know. No. No, you don't. You say you do, but you really don't. Yeah, but I want to. I really do. How the party go? - Ben cheated on me. - That little shit. - No, it's fine. - Definitely no. It's not fine. If it makes you feel any better, my date was a complete disaster as well. God, I hope so. Yeah, wel... What do you mean? You're standing in a graveyard with your daughter. It's not exactly a success. What did Em say about the whole Ben thing? She doesn't know. We had a big fight. - Your fault or hers? - Mine, completely mine. You think she'll forgive me? I know she will. She'd want you to be happy. You know that, right? Yeah. I know. You know, there was a lot of security here last week. - Really? Why? - Yeah. - People were dying to get in. - Dad! - Can't say that, it's really insensitive. - Why? It was funny. Not everything's a joke. Yeah. Sometimes I wish it was. Thanks. I really miss her, Dad. W... Well, I got you. Don't worry about it, honey. I got you. Let's go get warm, okay? Let's go home. Yeah. It's cold, let's go. Let's go home. - I'll make you some hot chocolate. - I guess. Yeah. You'll do everything I say from now on? - Fine. - Stop being a diva.
