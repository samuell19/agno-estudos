- Tragedy struck the small town of Los Almos, California last night when 16 teenagers were found brutally murdered on the night of their high school graduation. - A local extremist by the name of Norman Esner who lives less than two miles from the crime scene has taken a young girl hostage at his cabin this evening. Police have set up a blockade, but so far they've been unable to free the hostage. - Thanks, Marta. I'm here at the Esner property where authorities are engaged in a tense stand off with ex-patriot, Norman Esner. Police have erected an entire siege operation around the cabin in hopes of forcing Esner to negotiate but so far talks have not progressed. Locals are encouraged to stay at home and lock their doors. A strict five o'clock curfew for everyone under the age of 18 remains in place until further notice. Here's more from the officers in charge of this operation, Officer Beckett and Officer Nuno. Officers, what's the latest update in negotiations with Esner? - It's been three days, he can't stay in there forever. - He's probably stocked food to last through winter. - What's the plan. - Get down! - He left in the shed, follow me! Come on, come on! - We have you surrounded, Norman, release the girl and we can talk this through! - I didn't hurt anybody, I saved them! I freed them? - You didn't set them free, you murdered them! - Half a child's innocent stops the day they come of age. And when you people take that child out of a natural habitat that nurtured and cared for it, you kill the other half! You wonder why your children are angry and confused, 'cause you forced them to cross the bridge from innocence to sin! And for what, for what! For this, for a lie! For a nation built on lies! - It doesn't happen to be this way, Norman, no one else has to get hurt! - I saved them from that and I saved them from you. - Drop your weapon! - I saved them from that, I saved them! You should thank me, sheriff! You all should thank me! I am their savior! I will rise again. Satan, I belong to you. - Unlatch the door, unlatch the door. - I fear neither death nor life, dark master hear me now. I pledge my soul to you until the day I am called forth to rise again. - Drop the gun! - Rest assured. - Drop the gun! - My god, could you have picked a closer diner, I'm starving. - It has great reviews. - Something tells me it doesn't have rigatoni. - It's June 13th, 2016 and here we are at the Park Bench Grill. For our last supper before we reach our final destination, the Esner cabin. - Maybe you can interview the locals. - Ooh, yeah, maybe. - All right, Debbie! Hey, Linda, I'll see you in the morning. Hurray, you're a surprise or something huh? - I got a surprise for you. - Mm, okay. - Something tells me they're not gonna be up for questions. - Yeah. I guess it's self seating. Is it just me or is some of these people giving me the heebie-jeebies? - Now's your chance, Katie Couric, go interview them. - Okay this is just a hobby. You know very well I'm going to performing arts school in the fall. - Yeah, she's an amazing artist and vocalist. Here check this out, hmm? She designed it herself, kitty cat. - Multi-talented and beautiful. - Aww, always say what they wanna hear. Spoken like a future politician. - I only say what I mean unlike some people. - We'll see if you're singing that same tune after you're two years in office. - I wanna make positive changes, I'm not in for the glory. - Sure. - Oh. - Hey, my friend, Rita will be here in a few minutes. I invited her to ride with us, she lives close. You guys don't mind, do you? - Oh no. - No. - No. - No. - Oh, no, I guess not. - So, this cabin belong to a famous murderer. - Norman Esner. He went crazy there almost 20 years ago, murdered the entire high school graduating class. Easy, she's blind. - We thought it would be fun to practice our witchcraft with a seance there. - And we're getting in there how? - I only found out about the place a few weeks ago after my mom put it up for sale. I looked up the address and discovered it's cool history. - Your mom never mentioned it before? - No, I didn't even know she owned the property but that didn't stop me from stealing the keys. It's the perfect place for one last party before we all go our separate ways. - Yeah. - Hey, it's just college, it'll be over before you know it. Then it'll be on to our next adventure together. Friends forever, right? - About time. All right, well, I'm gonna take this grilled chicken breast and maybe a couple of those breasts if you don't mind. Come here baby. - Hey, Tex, the lady doesn't wanna be touched! - Come on. Whoa, whoa mind your own business city boy. - Well, you just made it my business. - All right, geeze, man, we was just joking around. - No, you touch her again and you have to deal with me. - Oh my god. - Do you believe this guy? All right, pretty boy, I'm sorry. Why don't you go back to your table. - It's time for you to leave, you big bully. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, we was leaving anyway. Hey girls, call me. Come on. - We was leaving anyways, let's go. - Let's get the hell out of here guys. - He really put you in your place. Oh he's in danger now. - Hey, that's their car, right? - Yeah, what about it? ♪ Where my world went wrong ♪ - Idiots. - Dan, what the hell are you doing? - What's it look like I'm doing, man, I'm stealing their car, get the hell out of here. - Hey, Dan, come on man. - Give me a second, one second, hold on. Yeah, hey, get in, get the hell in. Get in, get in, get in, get in! Ooh, yeah, girls get in, come on. ♪ Low down low down ♪ - Hey, James is that your car? ♪ Ain't around ♪ - No, hey! - James! - Hey! - My car!

You can't save everyone, you know? - Bummer man. ♪ Low down ♪ - Hey, there you are. - Oh, hey! - Oh my gosh. Hey, guys, this is Rita. - It's nice to meet you all and thanks for the lift, oh my gosh, the buses here suck. - I just need a minute. - Is he okay? - Don't worry about it. - Remind me once again why I'm the only Irishman in the middle of nowhere. - Try being the only Mexican in a 300 mile radius. You should see the way they look at my wife when they realize she speaks English. Oh yeah, she sent this for you. - Hey. I ordered a burrito. - Code six. - Go tell my wife you ordered a burrito. What do you think I'm running a tacoria out of my house, feel lucky she gave you anything. - Home incidents, I need combed for any trouble 600 North Monte, apartment four opened 911 lines. - Hey gringo. - Hmm? - You know there's no such thing as a burrito in Mexico? - What? - They just say taco for both. If you want a taco, it's taco. If you want a burrito, it's taco. - That makes no sense. - If you go to Mexico and order a burrito, they'll just kick you right back over the border as soon as you get there, I'm telling you. - Is that right? Best way to get yourself kicked out is to order a burrito. - Oh no, it's drugs but the burrito thing helps. - It's a taco conspiracy huh? - Think we made these kids wait long enough? - I guess. - Should we go out there? Okay, looks good. I will get ahold of you if the car turns up. So where exactly are you kids headed? - 2001 Oldham Road. - 2001? - Yeah, the Esner cabin. - Okay, you kids have no right going there. That cabin should have been destroyed years ago. It's nothing but an eyesore and bad memories for the whole community. - My family owns the place. - Who exactly is your family? - My mother and stepfather to be. - What's your mother's name? - Linda Hamilton. - How is she? - Fine, why do you know her? - No, look, I'm just suggesting you guys go some place else or better yet, get in your car and just drive home, okay? - Whatever. - You can go. - There's plenty of room in Austin's car. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Shall we? How we doing, we all in? - Lay on our lap. - Yeah, ass but I'm going to the back. - Fuck it. - Sorry, dude. - Thanks, man. Fuck, I don't even know how I'm gonna be able to close this. - You got it. - Whew! - Okay, girls, before we enter, let's clear any negative energy. - Where are they? - Who knows, they're witches, better to just let them do what they want. Well, one of us should keep an eye on them. Hey be careful. - Yeah. Well, I guess I'll give this a try. All right before Greg does. All right. Whew, that was on there pretty good. Here put this somewhere to the side. - Whew! Oh it smells awful. - Love and light, I banish all negative energy from this space and bless it with divine love and light. - Okay, now let's find the power box. - Let's split up look around the cabin. - Okay, cool. - Oh, check this out, oh, wow. - Oh Jesus. - I feel like I just walked into a dust storm. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Oh my god! - Norman Esner, nice to finally meet you here. - More like Norman Bates. Look at the way he's standing. - What's that on his neck? - Are you okay? - Yes, I just got a little dizzy, that's all. - Such a pretty girl, a good girl. A pretty girl, that's it, that's it, that's it. Such a good girl. Aren't you a good girl, hmm? - Whoa, you think it's loaded? - Ah, nah, it probably hasn't even been fired in like 20 years. Ah, it's antique. - That psycho has a disturbing collection. - Use it for practicing the dark arts. - You guys practice the dark arts. - We only use our magic for good. He obviously used his the wrong way. - Kiss me, maiden. - Get away! - I think King Tut forgot his mask. - Put that back, Greg, it could be valuable, I'm talking to you idiots. - I think he looks younger in this one. - Hey, I can't believe you talked me into coming to a place that once belonged to a serial killer, Ashley. Okay, I don't do this sort of thing. - Actually, he wasn't a serial killer. A serial killer's a person who attacks and kills his victims in a series of incidents. Esner killed all his in one day. - Well, he must have been a really bad dude. - Well, he didn't start out that way. He joined the military right after high school and quickly worked his way up the ranks to sniper. He made this town proud. Even rescued a dozen of his comrades who were held hostage all by himself. Brought back a necklace of ears after that mission. - Necklace of ears. - He cut of an ear from each enemy he killed. I read it was at least 50 guys. Him and his comrades were tossing the necklace around like some sort of trophy all the way home. Creepy huh? - Grow up, you're so immature. - But the war, all the killing were too much for him. He started to become angry with the military and his country. He was discharged and returned home. After attempting to live in town among civilians, his odd behavior became more and more noticeable. Like preaching anti-military propaganda, said the military stole his soul. When it became apparent that Esner wasn't going to settle back into town, he moved to this cabin deep in the woods and isolated himself here. Then several veterans officers around the US reported receiving envelopes with white powder and anti-government rants. They suspected it was him but the lead investigator had a soft spot for Esner. His own son was one of the men he rescued. When one of the veteran's offices reported receiving a human ear in the mail, the investigator knew it was Esner but he made the case and the ear disappear. - And you found all this out online, hmm? - Yes. - What do you say we change the subject and pick out our rooms, spruce this place up a little bit? - That sounds good to me. - Maybe they can find a few brooms and sweep these floors. - Yep, yes. - Oh, Rita, Ashley and James look around in here, I saw some tools out back, I'm gonna show Ashley where they're at. - Rick, help me unload the car? - Oh Anna, honey can I borrow your hairspray? I think I left mine in James' car. - Of course, sweetie, it's in my bag. - Why don't you go buy a tampon while you're at it. - Very funny James. - I would dear, but my period ended last week. - Come on. - You could ease up on him you know? - I just feel like every time I turn around he's next to you. You can't blame me for wanting to have my girlfriend all to myself, can you? Next he's gonna be asking to borrow your underwear. - Actually, I told him he could borrow some of Austin's. You don't think he'll mind do you? He left all his stuff in your car. - Okay, okay, too much info. All right, help me clean up this dump. - Yeah, clean up your face, I got lipstick all over you. - Oh my god. - Whoa! - Right, move this. - Perfect. - Hey. - Perfect. That's pretty comfy. We can't do it right now. - Sure we can, you promised. - You still have that? - The offer still stands if you'll accept. - Of course I'll marry you eventually. - You bitch. - You know I need to reach the world, you know, make some new friends. And luckily I've already met Rita. - Yeah, how does Meghan feel about hat? She can be awfully clingy. - Meghan will be fine. She knows I'm leaving, I know Meghan. - What the fuck, Ashley? - She's always been such a really good friend and - Look what I found, huh? - I thought all that was lost in James' car, thank Jesus. - I must have put it in Ashley's by mistake. - I'll drink to that. - You'll drink to anything. - So, what's your point? - Uh, Meghan, you're bleeding. - What happened? - I cut myself on a glass vase, it's no big deal. - You might wanna put some medicine on there. - I said I'm fine, really I'm good. - This weekend isn't just a fun filled time for us, it's also a test. - Of our skills. As most of you know we've been studying witchcraft the past few years. - Today we offer you the opportunity to join our coven, to watch, learn and do as instructed. Do you accept this opportunity? - Sure, whatever. What makes you think this stuff is real? - I can name dozens of instances. - When Ashley was failing math, she did a spell and she pulled her grade from an F to a C in just three weeks. - Hmm-mm. - You'd be amazed at what a few weeks of hardcore studying can do. - I cast a spell on my last boyfriend that cheated on me, he broke into hives in a delicate area. I put a hex on that bully, Sarah Winters who was harassing me at school and the next day she mysteriously dropped out. - She dropped out because she was pregnant. - I cast a spell for Austin to become the quarterback of the football team, which he did. - Well, thank you baby. - Oh, those all could be coincidences. - We also talk to the dead. I talk to my mom all the time through Meghan. - So how do we do this? - Oh, no not in here. We're going down to the basement. - Oh the basement. - Oh. - I wish it wasn't dark. - It has to be dark in here if you wanna join, witches don't fear the dark. Repeat after me. I bind myself to this coven. This isn't a joke, say your liege. - I bind myself to this coven. - Do you promise to protect the members of this coven? - Hey you got anymore of that liquor back there? - No, that was it. - And it's keep it's secrets close. - What's this? - What you got there baby girl? - Give me your hands, I have to put a small cut into each of you. - You wanna play doctor? - You know I wanna play doctor. Hey now, come on, come on, cut it out. Hey, come on, stop it, man, I can't see! - Now we'll all put our hands together and become one. - Hey I can't see, I can't see, god damn it! God damn it Mandy! - Are there any spirits here that want to talk to us? - Come on, I can't see a god damn thing. - Of magic. - Oh shit. - I will rise again. - That wasn't there before. - It was here when I came up. - It's like super old school. - You mean it still works? - Only one way to find out. - It could have been filmed anywhere. - Really, isn't that the shed out back? - I didn't see a shed out back. - It's out there. I saw it when Meghan and I went for a walk. So he filmed himself during the slaughter, do you think the police know about this? - I didn't find anything online about a video tape. - Did you see the way. - Should we take the tape to the police, just brush it off as a hoax? - That was no hoax. - You heard how adamant that cop was about us not coming here. He probably has nothing better to do than to fuck with tourists. - Unless someone at the diner overheard us. - Real or not, now whoever left this tape is probably sitting somewhere right now having a good laugh. - Rita was the only one in the room when the tape appeared. Ashley how well do you really know her? - Yeah, you really think that I. - Meghan that's ridiculous. - I was only pointing out a fact. I didn't mean to accuse anyone. - You wanna know what I think, I think Esner left that tape for us. Okay, you heard what he said when we were down in that basement. I say we pack up our shit and go before it's too late. - Now, Esner went in the shed. We should just check it out. - Austin, are you crazy? Check the shed, you know what, give me your keys, give me your keys, I'm leaving. And anyone else who wants to come too is welcome. - Look, whoever left the tape wanted to hurt us, they would have done it when they had the chance. Here, take this if it'll make you feel any better. Come on. - Come on. - Okay. - Probably tastes like shit after 20 years. - Yeah, you'd know Greg. - Oh good one. - Oh my god, is that what I think it is? - Well, I guess the story about the necklace of ears was true. - Let's hope we don't find the rest of them. These letters are dated over 20 years ago. - I got you a present. Face of angel, pure innocence. You know I wasn't supposed to keep you around this long, don't you? You're such a good girl for not fighting me like the others. Can you offer me forgiveness for not saving you? I need you to forgive me. I need you to forgive me. - Everybody got what they need? Let's take a look at them in the cabin. Let's go. - I need you to forgive me. - Fuck fuck motherfucker! God damn it! - Are you okay? - God no. Come on, come on. - Man! - Ow my hair. - How many times do I gotta tell you to not mess with me when I'm driving, huh? - I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. - Go get! - Hey, maybe we can fix it. - Maybe we can fix it, now you sound as dumb as she does. Man look at this thing it's totaled. - Hey. - I'm on probation and if anybody finds out about this, I'm going to jail, so. - Hey, look nobody saw us, let's just ditch it right here and go. - Where, ditch it and then go where, man? We're in the middle of fucking nowhere. - Look man, I don't know. - Idiots. - We gotta walk somewhere. - Hey, hey, what about here? - Huh, maybe you do got some brain cells left in that dumb head of yours. Let's go, come on, come on! - Dude, where the hell are we? - Hey girls, we ain't got all day, let's go! - It's just letters. - Oh, ooh. What is that? - Uh. - A dead lizard. - Sick. - It's written in all caps. "Dear reporter, I'm writing this letter to condemn our government and military for the actions they have taken against humanity. It took death and destruction to bring me to the realization that I too was once a lamb plucked from my home and sent to unfamiliar pastures. Taken from the safe haven of my youth to only be altered forever. But like the lamb the wool was pulled deep over my eyes. These children are being brainwashed and manipulated under false pretenses by not only the military but also these institutions and modern day colleges. They are uses these children as puppets, removing the soul and leaving only an empty shell which like the marionette they can manipulate with strings to do their bidding. We must spread the word worldwide and put an end to them before it is too late. I feel like you are the only one to tell my story. I wait your reply, Norman Ester." "Dear reporter, I have been patiently waiting your reply. My story must be told and I am running out of time. I can't begin to tell you how ashamed I am every time someone calls me a war hero. It absolutely destroys me to think what this country did to me and the other souls. I feel a sickness in the deepest pit of my soul knowing I cannot save them all from their ill fate. A blackness is growing within me and I know if I do not act soon it will spread until it consumes everything. Please let me know if you have received this letter, Norman Ester." - This one was sent to the governor, it was returned unopened. - This was also sent to the governor. This one to the leader of the CIA, FBI, another to the president of the United States, all unopened. "Don't let them be next." There's something written on the back. "Stop recruiters from going to your schools, homes and churches and selling them on lies. Save your children." - That's beyond fucked up. - These articles Norman match up to the kinds of the letters. - This one is dated June 14, 1995, the day of the massacre. "I'm ready for doomsday. Most people will not understand my actions but perhaps there will be those enlightened ones who will. I know my time here is short and I will be forced to take myself out of this world in the process but thanks to the ritual I am able to return." - Last one. Do you wanna do the honors? - "It has been two days since I brought the girl here. I admit that I find something about her soothing and I know now that there are bigger powers at play here. She was spared for a reason. Linda Hamilton, such a pretty name." - Isn't that your mom's name, Linda Hamilton? Melinda Hamilton. - No, no. - And you said your mother only told that your father died in the military. - Yeah, my mom just doesn't like to talk about it. - There must be a connection. - And your mom owning this cabin, is that just a coincidence too? There must be some kind of unexplainable force pulling you back to this cabin. - I told you already I found the keys by accident. - There are no accidents in the spirit world. - Why are you guys doing this to me? You're supposed to my friends. - So, Meghan's psycho's baby? - Stop it! That can't be true, it's not true. - Oh my god. - You okay? - Yeah. - Why do you always have to be such a dick? - Hey! Jesus, man. Good, you guys are all here. - You again. - Surprise. - Come back to return my car? - Oh yeah, about that Chuck, I got in a little accident on the way over here, sorry. - What, what do you mean you got into an accident? - Hey, man it wasn't our fault you know? Smoke started pouring from the hood, something ran in front of us, a deer or some shit. - You reek of alcohol. - Oh, man look, the girls are hurt, they need to go to the hospital. - Go ahead, help yourself. - She can't help it man, she's the child of alcoholic, right baby? Give me that thing. Hey you gonna bring us to the hospital or not, give me the beer. - Yeah, yeah, no, we'll bring you to the hospital right after we take you to the sheriff. - What, come on, get off me! - I'm putting you under citizen's arrest. Now you guys better get out of here unless you wanna be accessories to this car-stealing, woman-abusing piece of shit! - Stop it, no he's not! - Yes, he is. - Yes, he is. - Mandy, Mandy, let them take him, we need to go. The cops are gonna show up and I'm not gonna be here. - What, Jeff, shut the fuck up man! - This is what I've been trying to tell you, he's nothing but an abusive loser. You can do so much better. - Let's go. - Girl, you better not leave me! Mandy get back here! - Shut up! - I'm gonna kick your ass when we get home! - Get comfortable! Piece of shit. - Asshole. - Woman abuser. - All right. - Oh my gosh, please be careful. - No service. - Me either. - Well, Meghan won't open the bathroom door. - She probably just needs some time alone. That was a lot to take in. - Some alone time doesn't sound like a bad idea right now. Come. - Wait, where are you guys going? - Alone time as in me and my girlfriend, not me, my girlfriend and you. - Okay, you don't have to be rude. - Don't be frightened innocent one, you're safe here with me. This is our destiny. Lie back now young one. Dark master's told me what I must do. - Thank god we're away from him. - Who? - Rick, he's so fucking annoying. - He's not that bad. - Yes, he is. You know, sometimes I wonder, do you really think he's gay? - What? - He can't seem to keep his hands off you. - Oh come on, he's as gay as they come. - I think he has the hots for you. - Do you think I could turn him? - Maybe, you're awfully sexy. - Why don't you show me how sexy I am. - Here? - There's no one around for miles. - Good point. - I know that look. - Well, guess we don't have any fuzzy handcuffs, guess we'll have to improvise, take what God's green earth gave us. - You're so kinky. - Well, you know. Can't let a bad girl like you get away. - I love it when you do that. Why'd you stop? - Satan. I belong to you. - No, no, no, no! No, no, no, no, baby! Baby come on, come on, come on, come on, no. No, no, no. No! No! No! No! No! Oh, shit! - James and Anna should be back by now. - I can't take this anymore, I'm gonna go look for them. Come on. - Who's gonna guard the cabin? Fuck this man, shit. - I don't think they would have come this far, James is just too much of a chicken. - He was angry, I mean, he might have walked back to the highway. - Holy shit, what is that? What, is that blood? - What the heck? - Look at this picture of Norman, can I have it? - No, we have to stay invisible, keep things exactly the way they left them and we can't let anyone know we're here. - Oh okay. - We should probably go. - Quiet, remember what Dad said, look for the light and follow it. - Oh, I miss you old friend. Don't worry man, I'm here to finish your work. Yeah, yeah, I'll get it done. - Excuse me, yoo-hoo, over here. Is the spooky cabin close by? - Spooky cabin, who told you about a spooky cabin? - It's one of the stops on our hiking trail. - What, this is private property, now you two get out of here. - You don't have to be rude, we were just trying to ask a question. - You get out of here before I make you sorry you're here. Get. - Bite me, red state creeper. Did you see that trench coat he's wearing, it's like 100 degrees out here. - Let's get back to LA where the normal people are. - Oh, that's Anna's nose ring. - It can't be. - Oh my god. - What? - Oh my god. - Oh, oh God! - Oh! - Oh my god! - Oh! - Oh my god. - Oh! - Oh my god! - It's okay, it's okay. - Oh god! Who could have done this? Oh god, oh god. Oh we gotta go, we gotta go, go go! We gotta go! - No sign of James anywhere. - Maybe he got away. - Let's hope he did. - I can't believe someone would hurt Anna, poor Anna who wouldn't harm a fly. - Wait, wait, wait, no what are you doing? - I'm letting him out. - No, no, no, no, I don't think that's a good idea. - Are you serious, you can't just leave him in there to die. Austin, what's gotten into you. - If we untie him the first thing he's gonna do is start a fight. We don't have time for that. - He's right, Ashley, it's just safer for everyone if he just stays in there. - I can't believe you two. - Why what's wrong? - I don't know. What? Guys, the car won't start. - I never should have come here. All I wanted to do was have a fun weekend and just meet a few new people and this phone, it just won't work. - No one knew this would happen. - You girls were messing with things that you shouldn't have. None of this would be happening right now if it wasn't for that seance, okay? We let him out and now he's just gonna pick us off one by one like he did in that video. - We still don't know who is doing this, okay? For all we know someone could have just been watching this place for years just waiting for occupants to play their sick, twisted games on. - But you saw Anna, no human being could have done that to her. - I don't know what to think. Yeah, but there is always a rational explanation for everything, none of this is real. - You said you believed it. - I told you what you wanted to hear, okay? - You mean you never believed me? - It's just what boyfriends do, okay, they bend the truth once in awhile if it makes your loved ones feel better. It's just a little white lie, it's no harm done. Ashley, Ashley where are you going? - I'm checking on Meghan, okay, she needs me. - We need to figure out what to do. - Night is approaching and we're 30 miles away from civilization. Are you sure we can't start the car? - There's no battery, Greg, someone took it. No, no, we stay here and we hike out at dawn. - If we stay then we're just sitting ducks, okay, why don't we just hike back to the highway and walk all night if it takes us that long? - No, we're safer here. Whoever killed Anna is still out there and we have weapons for protection. And we stay put and we hike out at first light. - Weapons, what weapons, this? - Did you lock the kitchen window? - I locked it. - Is everything else secure? - As secure as can be. Nobody's gonna be able to reach us here, we're too high up. - How's she doing? - She's a little. - I'm fine. Anna, I can't believe it. - Any word on James? - Nothing. - We've gotta do something. - Before there were some bullets for that gun. - Yeah, there might be some somewhere. Let's split up into groups and search the house. - Any luck? - No. - Oh I think I see something outside. - What is that? - No, don't let it in. - What, it? - No, no, no, what if it was James? - Please, don't open the door, you have to trust me okay? - Ashley, we need to do a protection spell. - What's gotten into this? - We need to paint this symbol next to every entry point. - You know, I was just thinking the shed had some better weapons, saws, drills, power tools. - It's not safe out there. - I think it's worth a shot. - I'll go with you. - The spell won't protect us unless we remain inside. - She's right, we're only protected in this cabin. - Damn kids. Dispatch come in, this is officer 299, I have a 502 about three miles north of I-37 Park Bench Grill. Possible 503 intoxication, dispatch two over. - Copy 299, you need a bus, over. - Negative, dispatch, car's empty. Starting a 10 mile perimeter search over. Damn kids. - Salt keeps out evil spirits. - Oh my god, are you okay? - I'm fine. - What about the guy in the shed? - He's uh. - So what do we do now? - We wait. - Help, let me in! - Well, we can't just leave her out there. - I don't think that's such a good idea, wait Austin. - He killed Jeff! He pulled him away. I tried to hide but he found me. He's been chasing me all night! - What about the girl you were with? - We got separated I lost her. And I saw your friend. - James? - Yes. - Lying in a ditch, he's dead. - Oh my god. - What? - No. - What! - We should take her out of here. - What the hell are we gonna do now? - This is all Esner's doing and he wants us to do that. - So, he's just out there killing and maiming our friends and there's nothing we can do about it? - We let him out, how do we send him back. - Yeah, is there like some way to recapture him? - There's spells but we've never done anything like that. - Here we go, an entrapment spell. - What's that? - It's a spell to capture a spirit. - We need to put a soul into the item that once belonged to them. - What about the music box? - Yeah, that should work. Now we just need something to seal it with. So once he's in he can't get out. - I saw some vice grips in the shed. - Sure. - I'll go for Anna. - Promise us you'll be careful. I will, besides if that bastard tries to mess with me, I'll just pull his hair or something. - Oh check this out, oh. - Who are you? - You're a bad girl, Mandy. - How do you know my name? - You sure like to show your boobs a lot don't you? - Show them to me. - No. - Let me see those boobs. - No. - Show me them titties, I'm telling you. - Okay, okay. - Take the bra off too, Mandy. Do it. Oh wow, you're gorgeous? - Who are you anyway? - Ted Kaczynski. - That sounds made up. - That's my real name, it's gonna be real famous one day. - What are you gonna do with that? - I'm gonna carve you up like a pumpkin. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. - You like what you see? - Oh my goodness. - Wow. - Everyone thought old Norman was crazy but I didn't. I saw something different, misunderstood genius, a hero. When I first moved over here, no one noticed me, but Norman did. He could have kicked me off his property but he let me stay. We became friends, he taught me things no one else had ever taught me. You kids thought you brought Norman back with your little hocus pocus act? I'm the one who brought Norman back. I collected some of his blood in this vile. And I made a promise to him that I kept and I brought him back, not you. Are you listening Ashley, Rita, Greg, Austin. Something that belonged to him, she belonged to him. So now you know, Norman is inside Meghan's body, they are combined, they are one. I poisoned their drinks, and then tied them and bagged them. And then when they woke up, I let them try and run away with those bags on. Shot them dead one of at a time. They had to have a toast to their failed entrapment spell, that burned Meghan's face after losing Rick. Well, that's the rest of the story, Now let's hide you heads deep in the woods where nobody will ever find you. - Miss, what are you doing here, miss? Uh. Jesus. - Daddy, when do I get to meet Norman? - Oh, soon honey, soon enough you'll meet him. - Do you think he'll like me? - He's gonna like you just fine. - I hope I get to marry Norman. Wait up! - It's okay honey, we'll get you to the hospital right away, come on, come on. Come on. Come on, you're almost there, come on. - I knew something was wrong when Nuno didn't check in last night with dispatch. Looks like you had a hell of a night. - Thank god you came along officer. You know my mother don't you, Linda Hamilton? - Yeah, I remember we met a long time ago. - I thought so. I can't wait to see her again. - Hush now save your energy. We're gonna get you to the hospital, we're gonna get you fixed up and you'll be home before you know it. - When the police come, they'll think I'm gonna save you like the others. But I can't save you yet. One day our child must return to this cabin, so I can be reborn. The dark magic that flows through me will be even stronger through our child.
