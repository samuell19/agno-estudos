Please respect intellectual property rights. If any suspicious behavior is detected, please inform the cinema staff immediately. NO MORE movie thieves. So annoying! Everyone is waiting for the movie to start, how many times do you want to play the movie thief promo before that? You said you didn't steal anything. Don't try to fool me. You stole something big. Do you still want to deny it? I see you several times before the movie to start, I've already know your opening line by heart. And the last time, right? I remember last time during "Gintama the Movie", you came here to make trouble too. Do you really think it is useful to play fool? It makes me mad to think of you doing a so-called mime. A mime like yours with no quality at all, I have no interest at all. It's tiring to watch a lot of boring trailers. Please understand the audience's frustration. Okay? NO MORE movie thieves. Anyway, just play the movie. Do you hear me? I'm really sorry to cause you trouble. But don't worry, the movie will start soon. And you should make an apology with me. I didn't ask you to mime an apology. Even mime the inner drama, there's no way the audience can understand it. Sorry. We will get it done right away. Would you please wait for a moment? Quickly! We can't keep the guests waiting any longer. What are you doing? Are you crying? Don't be kidding. What the hell are you doing? Don't you know everyone's waiting for you? If you don't apologize, the movie can't start. Do you hear me? Alright... Maybe I was a little over the line back there, but it's all your fault. Why were you being a movie thief? What? What do you say? You think you're pretty useless. Alright, don't be like this. If you have a good introspection, then I will forgive you. Never mind... Don't take it personally, I'm not really angry. But you know, there will be parents with kids in the cinema. We should do something for show. In a word, that's it. Okay, just make a quick apology and let the movie start. Yes? You aim for a career as a mime. It is great, but it's not good to be a movie thief because you have no money, right? Okay... Don't say it any more. There's no excuse. You can't use your dream as an excuse. Do you hear me? If you use this attitude, then you are looking down on mime. Does it make sense? All right, I'm done with you here. We'll talk about the rest backstage. Will you stand up first? Then do you think it is better to be a movie thief, right? Yes? It would be nice to think so, then just go! Be an amazing movie thief! I think you don't have to make an apology to the audience. Put your things away and get the hell out of here. What? What's wrong? You said there seems to be something wrong with the camera because I just kept hitting you. Really? Did I hit you that hard? Are you okay? Do I need to take you to get a repair? You said you can't be a movie thief anymore. Is that my fault? Are you blaming me? Wait. Don't go. I have quite a lot of credits on my VIP card, maybe we could... That should be enough. Yes? Well I am so... sorry. Why are you a movie thief, too? You'd better stop now. How long do you want to fool around in the opening? It's not NO MORE at all. It is some infinite loop. No. Because I accidentally caused him trouble, I seem to be responsible. You caused the trouble to the audience. You should be responsible for the audience. Our duty today is to patrol the cinema, we're responsible for clamping down on suspicious individuals. What are you doing? An old cinema like this that's about to out of business, there are not many people would come to watch the movie. Don't worry about it. And... I think they're the ones who are suspicious if they don't work in the middle of the day and come to watch a dirty movie like this. Who do you mean suspicious? Natural Wavy Hair. Even if everyone here is suspicious and useless, there are a lot of good kids watching on the other side of the screen. We as popular idols must teach them the proper etiquette of watching movies. Listen, all the good kids. Rule no.1 of watching movies, during the movie, you cannot take pictures or record. All shall be prohibited. If you see anyone suspicious like this, please inform the cinema staff as soon as possible to take them away. I'm already being treated as someone suspicious, right? Rule no.2 of watching movies, during the movie, make sure to turn off the power of your phone, calls and chats are prohibited. This will cause trouble for others. Mr. Takasugi is so cool! Someone who suddenly yells like this should turn the life off first. What are you excited about? What kind of horrible statement is that? Rule no.3 of watching movies, you can get all the limited products only after watching the movie 3 times, the gifts are different every time. Please be careful to some bad promotion like 'Animxx K-ON!'. Don't fall for it. Wait a minute. Does that count as an advice? Dirty grown-ups are starving for your wallets. Please hold on to your money and watch your wallets. No. I don't think we're in a position to say anything like this. Didn't we do so when "Gintama the Movie" was on? Rule no.4 of watching movies, when you watch the movie, "you got an erection", then you can get one original style film of queen, pig and horse. Once you've successfully collected all of them and combine them together, so you can get the complete picture of the world view of the movie. Good kids with excellent character and academic performance must have it. Don't encourage kids to collect such things. There are three of us, so we can collect all three of them in one time. Then, of course, I'll have the queen. Then I'll have the pig. Just like this, you can collect them with friends. Why do I have the horse? At least give me the queen. Cut the crap! I'm not paying you guys to talk. Hurry up and start the movie. Nobody wants to collect that shit. I'm sorry. Don't throw at us. The movie is about to start. Calm down, the movie thief is on the run. Stop there! Don't try to run away, you pervert with a camera. Do you still try to make a futile resistance now? Kagura, before he is taken away by the police, let's make sure he's actually taking pictures of something. I need you two to calm down. What's in there is probably forbidden, if we make sure of it in front of everyone, if something terrible happens on the big screen, it'll be terrible. Maybe there's something like "3D Sxx and Zen", which will make something accidentally come out. Even with your brains. Such a great responsibility, just leave it to me. Let's go somewhere private. It's not that convenient to get 3D here. Come! You, come with me. Don't worry. I won't mess it up. I just want to take a break. You just want to see '3D Sxx and Zen'. It's only the opening, and you're talking dirty. It's so vulgar. Let me look for the 'Play' button. Is that it? What images will I see? With that bloody look, just like a ghost, you're unable to protect your fellow and then set foot on the road of Shura. But your hands that invite the curse... will tear apart the people you love and protect one day. This is the karma of being a demon. People who love you or hate you, will be swallowed up because of you. You are alone and crying alone in this world forever, White Yasha! "Gintama the Final Movie" The country of Samurai, our country... Wait, what is this? Why is this all of a sudden happening? It was used to be the sky where samurais chased their dreams, now it's filled with spaceships from foreign countries. Why do you start with the part about the Amanto? What is going on? That's way over the top. This is the illegal version of Gintama Movie. This is where we live... It's okay if you just record it and watch it yourself. If it gets uploaded by the net friends before it's released, so our box office lost to 'Animxx K-ON!', what should we do? But it doesn't seem to be the final chapter. The subtitle "Be Forever Yorozuya" didn't come out. Anyway, is that what this movie is about? Why didn't I hear about this? The last samurai, Gintoki Sakata. He was called so. It has been a long time ago. Wait a sec. What's it all about? The final movie. So does that mean that Gin's life is over? Just because it's a movie, it doesn't mean you can do anything, okay? Normally such headlines are just gimmicks, no one makes it real. Naruto is still alive and well in "Naruto Shippuden the Movie". "Space Battleship Yamato" becomes Takuya Kimura in the end. Don't be kidding. Didn't I tell you that such a plot that will influence on original manga structure has to be approved by Shueisha first? I'm not in the mood for movie thieves, okay? I'm going to take a trip to the SUNRISE headquarter in Kamiigusa. Right, where's Kamiigusa? By the way, where's here? Weird, wasn't I in the cinema just now? How did this happen? No way... There's no way such a weird thing will happen. It must because of that. That 3D movie, right... Recent advances in computer graphics have brought such a boom. It's really good, so realistic. Is this what 3D movies feel like? Not only does the image pop up, the individual can run into it. Is it really okay to do so? I mean, it is so real. It is amazing. Even the dango on the side is so realistic that looks like it could actually be eaten. It really can be eaten! Don't... don't worry. The dango is meant to be eaten anyway. I see. 3D means three dangos. I haven't seen a 3D movie before, but it's no problem. That's definitely what 3D feels like. An offering for this guy is missing. Gintoki, I didn't expect there is someone out there who weren't afraid of retribution like you in this world. Old... Old woman. Do you remember it? You used to eat my husband's offerings. What a surprise! Your offering was eaten. That's what they call karma, I guess. It's been 5 years since you died. The city is totally different when you were alive. If you were alive right now, I wonder what you would say when you see this city. If the world you're in is hell, or the world we're in is hell, I can hardly tell now. Even so, we all try to live, accept your death, and work hard on different paths. So you just be there and rest in peace. This is not some 3D image, nor a movie. So... what the hell is this world? This is the genuine real world. No. It doesn't seem right to say this is the real world. Mr. Gintoki, for you, I should say, this world is a reality you will have to face sooner or later. So... So you can talk! What? Aren't you like the bakery dad in "Kiki's Delivery Service" who just knows the gesture language? Why are you all of a sudden fluent in English? Mr. Gintoki, I'm sorry I'm not a movie thief, nor the husband of Sona the bakery owner. I'm a time-transport device created by someone to summon you to this world, commonly known as Time Thief, which is the Time Machine. This world is what your world will look like 5 years from now. It's the future where one day everything around you will end. This world is... 5 years from now. It's the future where everything around will end. It's a natural reaction to be that surprised. But you're not the only one who died. As you can see, the world is now a wasteland, literally deserted. 30% of the Earth's total population died, over 40% of the population has migrated to other planets. This place has become a completely abandoned planet. In order to change this world, the guy who decided to summon you to this world... Who is this guy you're talking about? What happened to the world I was in to make it this way? Say something. Looks like my mission is complete, I'm done here. You explain to me, what is the mission? You just brought me here and broke down without warning. I guess you're nothing but making trouble. I have led you here, you are on your own from now on. That's a very casual attitude. It's like inviting someone to steak, but you just bring him a cow, which is so irresponsible. You want me to change the future, but how am I going to do it? And if you're broken now, how am I supposed to go back to my world? You, Time Thief! Stick this to your forehead. You were supposed to be some exotic that didn't exist in this world. As long as you are with this boo... As long as you are with this machine... then no one will ever know you're Gintoki, your appearance will change into someone else's. I thought you were going to say booger. I hope that's not your booger. Don't expose your identity. Be careful what you say and do. First, go find Mr. Gengai. After you find him, I'm sure he can help you. You can't die. Are you going to leave me alone in this world? Mr. Gintoki, please remember that you are not alone. Indeed, the world is completely new to you. But no matter in any world, even if the world has changed, there's still something... staying the same forever. Grab the future... with your both hands. You pull yourself together. So... so terrible. What am I supposed to do now? Hey, bro! What are you doing in the middle of the road? Do you realize that your camera damaged my favorite car? Give me all the money you have for the repairs. How did it suddenly change to the style of another animation? I feel like I'm in the "Fixt of North Star" right now. I'm sorry about that. Can you forgive me today? I can't think right now, so I have no time for you. Boss, this guy's not wearing a mask. Really? Walking the streets in Edo without a mask is like in a typhoon day without an umbrella, you'll get sick. Does this guy know about the White Curse? What? White Boar? I thought you all had bad breath, so you wear masks. So you are three little white boars. It's White Curse, not white boar. You didn't hear us clearly. This boy probably is some bad student from the countryside where has not yet infected the White Curse. Give me your valuables and your clothes. Not wearing a mask is just like being naked anyway. I advise you to stop this now. How dare you to travel this planet? I don't know if I should admire your courage, or laugh at your stupidity. Get back if you don't want to die. It doesn't matter if you're a bad student or a professional gangster, I will not let anyone continue to defile this city. By the way, White Curse is not some common disease that can be prevented by wearing a mask. I think you are the ones who are from the countryside. What? Damn! Watch your mouth! Run now! I'll take care of it from here. Take out that guy, too. That's... That bokuto is... Who the hell is this guy? He's so powerful. You see, that bokuto. And that glasses. This guy... is... You guys are so noisy in the street. Are you guys in heat? He's from Yorozuya... He's Shinpachi from Yorozuya. Is he Shinpachi from Yorozuya who is recently in the fight against the thugs? What? Wait. He's alone, what are you afraid of? What? Who's Shinpachi from Yorozuya? Cool boy, who are you? Are you that guy? After 5 years, the one with glasses I know... No... are you in the wrong place, sir? I have no idea who this guy is. I don't know any fake character of "The Prince of Tennis". What... what's going on? You're spending too much time dealing with these losers. You're not good enough to be Yorozuya. You're too young. Another noisy person here. It's Kagura. They are Kagura and Sadaharu from Yorozuya. Kagura from Yorozuya has been turning Edo upside down lately. Butch Kagura. Sunglasses. Wait... wait. The Sunglasses I knew looks like this. After 5 years, this guy with the sunglasses... Where did you attack with the enemy on this side? I'm fine. I kicked something by accident. Is... is she the one? The one who eats like a bottomless pit and has no beauty at all. Fried chicken skin is the best, bring it to my rice. After 5 years, the lame heroine who wasted the voice actress... Let me indicate first, I'm not here to save you. Make no mistake. I was just passing by on my way to get some vinegar kombu. It was just a coincidence. Take the beautiful voice of the voice actress to the extreme, she's totally turned into a haughty character. Who are you? Who's this girl with the big boobs and young look? Damn, why would two members from Yorozuya caused a stir in Edo appear at the same time in such a place? I... I can't do it, Boss. They're monsters. Withdraw... withdraw, both of you, remember that. Come on. Really? These two people... only took 5 years to grow this strong. What's going on? With the look of Gin's successor. I suspect you ate Gin. Do you want to get the lead while I'm absent? What? Get the lead after Gin's dead? Bastard. I can't believe you haven't learned and kept being the Yorozuya. Same here. Anyway, you should be getting tired of playing house. What are you saying? I think you're the one playing house. I warn you to stay out of my way. Edo doesn't need two Yorozuyas. Please don't mention me and you in the same breath. My Yorozuya has nothing like your weak one. I don't think so. What do you say? If you're not convinced, I'm going to prove it to you right now. Interesting, who deserves to carry the name of Yorozuya. Let's fight it out today. Forget it, forget it. I'm a little confusing, but let's just calm down. Harmony brings wealth, right? Why are these guys so unfriendly? Anyway, are the two of you Shinpachi and Kagura from Yorozuya? Who is this wretched old man? He got a booger on the face. Who is the wretched old man you said, rude girl. Don't think you're something with big boots and young face. Why are you so arrogant? And make no mistake. This is not a booger on my forehead, it's a mole. You are the one who made a mistake. I'm not talking about the mole on your forehead, I mean the dark, green blob next to it. I actually got a booger on it. By the way, why is this guy cosplaying Gin? And he seems to know about us. I almost forgot. As long as you are with this machine... then no one will ever know you're Gintoki. Don't expose your identity. Be careful what you say and do. Actually... I used to be taken care of by Gin and we were good friends. We're so close like we were childhood best friends. Childhood best friends? Right... this costume was also a birthday present from Gin. I've heard a lot about you guys from him, too. I've never heard that he has some childhood best friend. What's your name please? What? You said your name is Hot Pot? Hello, I'm Hot Dog. That's what Gintoki looks like in others eyes. Just Hot Dog. Are you talking dirty? This is the first time I've heard of his childhood best friend. So you heard about Gin's death and came to visit his grave? Yes, I was just rescued on the way by these two from Yorozuya. And what's going on with you two? When did you start reorganizing Yorozuya? Don't make me laugh, Otose. I had no intention of working with little girl. I don't want to take a burden. No, thanks. Pooh! Excuse me, I heard those two were with Gin at Yorozuya and they were in a good relationship, right? The old Yorozuya has long since dissolved. Gintoki died and the world turned into chaos. For the future of Yorozuya, those two were always arguing. Now they're splitting things up, developing Yorozuya FUMIYA and Yorozuya TAKAMOKU. Is it okay? I wonder if there will be a fact book of Yorozuya. In fact, they are fighting for the throne of the successor. What? To see who has the ability to replace Gin to guard Edo. But did Gin even try to guard Edo? I don't know what's going on in their heads. To carry on that fool's legacy, neither of them would back down. What the hell are these guys up to? There's no need to fight about inheriting the Yorozuya. I'm not being nosy. Although I'm not sure what happened. Please give me a bottle of beer. It's not a good idea to fight. Talking about carrying on Gin's legacy, beware of inheriting his debts. Compare to this, Gin would have preferred that you two get along. Don't pretend that you know Gin's mind. Of course, I know more about him than anyone else. I don't need a partner anymore. Now that man has gone astray. I have... given up the mocking skills and Tsuu's CDs. Forget about the CDs, they're just bunches of junk. How can you give up your own characteristics? The future will be the age of Muscat Oedo. Tsuu Terakado, an amazing icon... What? So that's the 'go astray' you said. You're not the only one who lost many, so am I. After 5 years of living in Edo, my accent, the confusing and unorthodox grammar have become unusable. This is just a foreign artist's boring annoyance. It's Tsuu who lost the most. Stop, Hot Dog. Everyone has changed in these 5 years. Right, no matter become better or worse, these changes are the privileges of youth. People change as they grow older. Compared to the two of them, I haven't grown at all. I think you're the one who's changed the most. Gin in heaven will laugh at me when he sees me like this. I won't! What happened to you the last 5 years? Catherine, go deal with it. Catherine, anyway, it's been 5 years and you've aged a lot. Mr. Hasegawa, what? That's a nasty thing to say to a lady. Who's the lady? You're an old man. You'll be laughed at by Mr. Sakata in heaven. I think you're the one who would be laughed at. We felines are blessed, only beard would increase when we age over time. Isn't growing a beard scary enough? No, to me, you guys have done so well in the last 5 years, not like me, keeping looking back. Let's not talk about moving forward, it is impossible to stand on both feet. Updated some parts, I'm still adjusting to them. You have totally changed. Although I cannot walk, it's good because I'm faster. I can do core separation. But Mr. Gintoki must be laughing at me in heaven. It's too weird. These guys are so weird. I can't do anything about these guys. But thanks to them, this place can still be full of laughter. That guy's buddies are a bunch of dumb, inflexible idiots. They have always been supporting the city. The only reason they're still here is because of that idiot. I want to ask you something, what is the White Curse? What happened in Edo? White Curse is what changed all that. With Edo as the epicenter of infection, this deadly virus is spreading rapidly around the world, killing people in less than half a month. And there is no treatment method, people from all walks of life have no clue, the cause of infection and the way of infection are unknown. Hair all over the patient's body fades and turns white. The symptoms are like a white curse, so it's called White Curse, a mysterious virus feared by the world. The only way to prevent White Curse is to leave. The rich guys left the earth long ago and fled, there are only helpless poor people, thugs who take advantage of the chaos, and a bunch of stubborn old men who are too stubborn to run away. So is the world I live in about to face this crisis? If this hadn't happened, Gin would still be here. He's probably going to sit there and pick his nose like he used to. Did I... No, did Gin also infect the White Curse? How could Gin be so easily taken down by that virus? The big idiot had disappeared long before White Curse had spread. We thought that he was just out fooling around and might come back one day. That's what we all thought at the time. Until we came across this notebook, Gin had known about White Curse before, even knew its alias as the Nanobot virus. Nanobot virus. Which means, White Curse is some virus created by someone. There are people behind the scenes plotting to destroy the world. Gin probably decided to go it alone to stop it all. According to the notebook, as the plan progressed to the final stage, in the middle of it... Gin ate some poisonous mushrooms growing by the roadside. It has nothing to do with White Curse. Where are the poisonous mushrooms? This is the end of the notebook. I'm afraid he did it because he had no food and water, in order to track down whoever's behind this... What kind of way of death? That doesn't look like a way for the hero to die. Make no mistake. Gin definitely did not die for this reason. He went to the convenience store to use the toilet and never came back. That's what the owner of the store who brought the notebook back told us. It's still a strange way to die. So did you ever think that maybe Gin is still alive? Who knows! No one knows if a man who has been on the toilet for 5 years is alive or dead, or he got flushed down the toilet, or just making a really long stool. But even he's making that long stool, I don't think he can live either. Any other way to die would be just as lame. Like shit that you can't wipe clean. Stop! So much for the White Curse. No matter how much we say, the time will not come again. No matter how much we wish, and it will never be that day again. I'll take over whatever that guy didn't finish. I will wipe out the White Curse. Shinpachi, you... You should know by now how dangerous this place is. As soon as you finish visiting the grave, just leave. Don't stay much longer. If I could turn back time, what do you think? Don't put on a mean face. I just said 'if'. I don't have time for this kind of joke. But in my eyes, what you're doing right now is pretty much a joke. I don't care what legacy you're trying to carry on. Dying to protect this broken planet, does it really mean anything? Indeed. You can't get back what you've really lost. But Gin is sure to come back. He will drink himself to death and stagger back. If then, there's no one left on this planet, and who's going to blanket that idiot and clean up his mess? This is the planet where we met that guy. I would never give up the home of Yorozuya and the fact that I am one of the Yorozuya. Really? Well, I'm relieved to hear that. Yorozuya, which can accept any kind of commission, will surely accept my commission, right? Do you want to reorganize Yorozuya with me? What the hell are you talking about? Why would I want to reorganize Yorozuya with someone like you? Stop talking in your sleep. Aren't you trying to finish what Gin left? If I have the power to help you, then you have to help me. Actually, my partner was broken when I got here. The only way I can fix that guy is to find Papa Gengai. What does this have to do with Gin's unfinished task? Trust to luck. Come what may, heaven won't fall. Stop kidding! Do you think we're going to help you with all that stupid stuff? You will. Because you are true Yorozuya. Why is Sadaharu... What are you going to do? Do you really want to work with that man? I have no choice. It's rare for Sadaharu to be so excited. Don't follow me if you don't want to. Your Yorozuya is lame anyway. A naive kid who just talks big cannot do anything big. Who are you talking about? That was close. I'm not falling for your trick. Do you think if you provoke me, I'll start mocking you? That's great. Do you think I want to hear your annoying mocking? I just don't allow someone messing up the reputation of Yorozuya when I'm not looking. Sadaharu, no! If you eat this terrible uncle, you could get something worse than White Curse, your crotch will itchy like crazy. What do you mean? You guys stick to the plan, I'm going to run to the clinic and be right back. Don't worry, it won't infect you, Mr. Shinpachi. Are you also naive in sexual knowledge? Who are you talking about? That was close. I'm not falling for your trick. Do you think you provoke me, then I'll get infected? I think you two are responsible for ruining the reputation of Yorozuya. What's that crowd doing over there? Excuse me. Excuse me... It turns out to be a public execution. Would Papa Gengai hang out in a place like this? It's hard to distinguish people with so many people. No, not here. It's over there. That's the mad scientist who started the terrorist attack to assassinate the general, known as the public enemy, Gengai Hiraga. This is... Papa Gengai was arrested 5 years ago, today is the day of the beheading. What? Behead? Why haven't I heard of that? What's going on? As you can see, that's exactly what happened. Papa Gengai was originally a wanted man at the Bakufu, he's just been living with a hidden identity. After Gin disappeared, he started drinking every day and gradually got out of control. One day he got drunk and turned KFC colonel into a weapon of murder, KFC thor lycra, and got caught red-handed by the authorities. What's wrong with that old man? This is embarrassing. If that old man dies, what about my Time Machine? Time machine. Nothing... No, it's my personal business. Why didn't you save him? Do you think none of us have tried? We tried every mean to consult with him. He didn't say anything at the meeting, we couldn't help him even we wanted to. Do you have any last word to say? What is wrong with you, old man? He's the only key that's going to change the future. Right, what about Casserole? Now that the Bakufu is like a candle in the wind. No matter how useless that guy is, he should come in handy... I think. That is the outraged Joi faction, known as the public enemy, Kotarou Katsura. This is... As you can see. What's wrong with that guy? And it looks exactly the same as the scene just now. Casserole had been transformed into a moderate Joi Faction. He was in a mess after Gin's missing, he became an aggressive Joi Faction. He said something about destroying the world when he was out of mind, so he transformed KFC thor lycra into KFC thor Shinsuke and got caught red-handed by the authorities. Why do they have to keep transforming KFC colonel? It's a pretty small scale to destroy the world. I thought that guy might have some clues, it turns out to be a farce. Does that idiot want to die that bad? Do you have any last word to say? Casserole... He seems to be writing something. Maybe he's trying to tell us something at the end. Well done, Casserole. You do know something, Casserole. I am not Casserole, I am Katsura. Sorry, I'll behead this Casserole who is waiting to die. Authorized personnel only. Wait, what are you doing? Don't stop me! If I'm not allowed to execute this idiot myself, I can't be relieved. Calm down. I can't watch this anymore. Right, where's Shinsengumi? Those legal hooligans, no matter how useless, should have learned something... Is he Gorilla? Indeed. This is... As you can see, this is a gorilla. Enough! Why are you being arrested as a police? The Gorilla kept stalking Tae. One time, he disguised as KFC Colonel, got loaded with a bazooka by some weird old man, and put a pipe by a strange long-haired man, then the bazooka was accidentally ignited and damaged the shop street. As a result, he got caught red-handed by the authorities. So you're the KFC Colonel himself. These idiots have combined to create the stupidest miracle in the world. Don't be kidding. Who can introduce the top management of Bakufu to me? Is anyone listening to me? Do you have any last word to say? Gorilla... Hang on. That guy seems to be writing something, too. I feel like I'm erecting. I'm sorry, let me cut this guy's dxxx. Please allow me. This is the execution ground. Will you please step out? Wait. Stop making a mess, okay? Go to hell. I can't take the hate out of my heart if I don't teach these idiots a lesson. Even if Gorilla cannot do anything, we still have Mr. Hijikata. The execution is going to happen, there is no time to get help. Papa. Thank you, Yorozuya. Thanks to you guys messing around, distracting them, making it easy for us to get in. This... this is... The former No. 1 Squad Captain of Shinsengumi becomes the most ferocious enemy of Bakufu now, master of kenjutsu, Sougo Okita. Wait... wait. There are people on the dike. The hour of the revolution has come. The country that took away Isao Kondo from us. The country that took away Kotarou Katsura from us, should be punished with death penalty. Under me, Toshiro Hijikata's command. I, Elizabeth, will play forward. Go! They are the radical Joi faction and the Katsura's Faction. The two factions formed an alliance. Run! We will get involved. What's it all about? Not just the top management of police, it's like all members assemble, and they're all in Joi faction. What the hell? Why is it that people who were on the same side as the Bakufu not long ago are now running to overthrow Bakufu? The two sides that were against to each other suddenly formed the Avengers. How is it that monster seen not so long ago in outer space now becomes the real monster? - This is our chance to save papa now. - Wait a minute. I won't let you take the lead. - Don't you stand in my way. - Shut up! Please don't fight at the critical moment. Damn it, I'm not going to give you what you want. Papa, watch out! Pass! You are responsible for this. By any mean, this is all your fault. Stop it. I was covering for you. You bite the hand that feeds you. The chief culprit is clearly Kagura. Shinpachi, don't talk nonsense. This is all about you taking credit. I'll give it to you for taking credit. Take it, you thief! What the hell? Why don't we just play rock-paper-scissors? By the way, you're the one who killed him. Why don't you just dunk it? Give it to you. I want to dunk with your head. What's that noise? What a pity. Thank you for buying. Here's to our boss. Cheers! "Welcome back, Mr. Kondo and Mr. Katsura" I honestly owe you guys a big thank you. No, an apology. You've been working so hard while we were absent. Such a trifle is not worth mentioning. Now even Shinsengumi is helping us, we have no enemies left. No, no. Mr. Elizabeth, what are you talking about? What should be appreciated most this time is your samurai spirit. So do you. Living up to the reputation of Demon Vice-Chief. Mr. Elizabeth, that's all long gone. We're the White Lightning Super Mayonnaise Brothers now. Toshi and Eli. Exactly, Toshi. What a pleasure, Eli. Mr. Katsura, there's something I need to talk to you. Stop talking about the past and let it go. Mr. Katsura. Just call me Casserole, Mr. Kondo. You can call me Gorilla. As long as we work together, I believe we can change the age of corruption. You're right. Let's move forward together and go on a journey to the age of innovation. Commander, Mr. Katsura. You're forgetting a bunch of important guests. Yes? Right. Guys, let me introduce you to our MVP in action today, the radical Joi faction, members from Yorozuya. Please applaud. Who are the MVP? Thanks to you, we're now associates in crime. Shinpachi and Kagura, thank you very much! I can't believe you joined the alliance to fight with us. Don't touch me, Gorilla. Well... Although I heard about your sudden dissolving, it's nice to see you guys together again today. So is this man the newest member of Yorozuya? It doesn't feel like that guy at all. Shinpachi, I don't think he's capable of taking the lead. How could Gintoki be replaced by a guy like this? I won't allow it, I am totally against it. Weird, why do I have to let these people judge me? Well, was his resume reviewed before he was hired? You have to kill at least two or three people to succeed the boss. Do you? You are not qualified to say that to me, you copycat battosai. Don't lecture me! I don't want anything to do with this guy. And I have no plans to reorganize Yorozuya with anyone. Is that so? Anyway, Shinpachi, how is Ms. Tae? She's not married, right? I guess she's still single, right? She must be getting prettier, right? Is she...? Didn't I tell you not to touch me? Shinpachi, don't be such a stranger. Shinpachi. Sadaharu and I are so tired, we'll get back now. Wait till I'm in the mood. Bye! Hasn't the pain healed up yet? Although everyone has changed, they're the only ones who haven't changed at all. They can't help thinking that. You can't blame them. We finally got our boss back. But their boss can never get back. It's been 5 years since that guy was gone. So terrible! I am so shameful to meet him in heaven. I can't take his place in protecting what he values. So do you have any idea what happened to him? White Curse... No, that time, that name didn't even exist. Do you know why Gintoki was first informed of the existence of the White Curse would spread throughout the Earth so long ago? That's because he met it 15 years ago. 15 years ago? Right, in the time of the Joi War. 15 years ago, in order to end the long Joi war, Bakufu recruited an army of mercenaries in one battle. Because this army of mercenaries can devastate a planet with a single strike. Such taboo existence has been hidden behind the truth of history, they are regarded as the scourge of planetary destruction, called... Enmi. Have you ever been involved in the Joi war? I've heard of those guys, too. They use a spell called Bug Poison, which was also responsible for causing a large number of Joi factions died. It turned out that the truth of their spell was a tiny machine called a Nanobot. And the Nanobots they used are very similar to White Curse virus that has become a ferocious disease today. Did you investigate Gintoki's death? After all, I was a police. I should do some sort of investigation when someone dies. How could something like this happen? These guys were indeed at that time... If there are any remnant left... Do you have any evidence for that? No. But I think Gintoki should sense something, he must have. So he wanted to take actions before the White Curse spreads. Now I can only talk about it over and over again with regret, I should have known it earlier. You shouldn't be the only one who has to take the karma, Gintoki. What's wrong? Kyobee? It's been a long time. You're getting better at it. Tsukuyo. Looks like you are a little taller. What's the matter with you two? Long time no see, why do you have your hair cut short? Are you lovelorn? You haven't changed a bit, Sarutobi. Of course. The beauty of the female ninja is also a weapon. Just some aging skin. What do you say? I think you two are about the same. I'm not like you. I'm very popular. And I don't have to cut my hair short. I won't be lovelorn. So it is. Tae hasn't changed at all. Really? My eyes can't see very well now. Even my hair is also taken care by Shin every day. Is it neatly combed? Nothing has changed. You look the same as you were young. You're not only beautiful, but also energetic, with your own style. And you look still energetic. That has already been said. And still beautiful. That has already been said too. And still careless and scheming. What? I'm just telling the truth. It's not truth at all. Please look at the situation, you can't tell it even it's truth. You're the one who said the worst. I haven't laughed like that in a long time. We all used to get together and laugh like this. But... after Edo becomes like this, we hardly get together. So as Shin and Kagura. They are not willing to face each other properly. It would only hurt more to see each other in pain. Because as long as they see each other, they will think of that time, and that person's face involuntarily. Where the hell did he go? If that irresponsible Natural Wavy Hair doesn't come back now, we're really going to split up. If he doesn't come back now, then I never get a chance to say goodbye. I really wish I could see all three of them smile again. Tae. Sarutobi. What are you talking about? How could you die in such a place? Stand up, you bitch! - Stop, Sarutobi. - You washboard, sadist! Do you know why I haven't changed in 5 years? That's because I still believe that guy will come back. I want to keep it that way, and when he finally comes back, I'll greet him as I was. But you said you were going to die, Are you going to leave without that guy and us? I will not allow such a thing. Before my wedding to Gin, I will not allow you to die like this, do you hear me? Come on and punch me! You're not the kind of woman who takes the scolding in silence. You bitch, retort me like you used to do, washboard. At least say something. Do you hear me? Don't be so noisy in the hospital. Are you in heat? You guys. Aloha. It's been a long time since I've seen you, women. What? Why are you with the shocked look? So disgusting, who are you? Cosplay in this situation, do you want to die? Let's tie him up and throw him in the Pacific. Is it Gin? Really? Gin... you're back. Tae. Exactly, sister. Gin is back. Tae, then Yorozuya of our three will be ready to reopen soon. What the hell are you two doing...? You are too late, Yorozuya people. Mr. Kondo. Don't worry, Ms. Tae. We will all stand by your side. Am I really not dreaming? So from now on, you don't need to worry anymore, about your future, our future, and this world's future. We will definitely change it for you. Thank you. I don't know where you came from to poke your nose into my business. You were crying. So were you. Make no mistake. I won't cry for you. What are you saying? Cry Baby, Glasses. You two just let it go please. Haven't you given up the mocking skills and the accent? Shut up! See you. What a memorable old customer. What do you feel now? Do you want to sit down and have a drink? Buy me a drink, old man. You've turned the whole Edo upside down. Sorry, I have an appointment tonight. If you want a drink, ask him first. How does it feel to be here? It's terrible. The future isn't any fun place. Looks like it's not just the old man turning into a hyena, even the old woman has become a fox. To help me understand the state of the world, you guys really make so much efforts. It was my fault that the great invention broke down, it took me five years to complete. How? So have you figured out how to change the future? Who knows? Not talking about the future, I'm afraid even the ghosts of the past are running out. If it goes on like this, let alone changing the future, I don't think you'll figure out how you died. Good thing the mainframe of Time Thief has no damage. Take care of all this before I fix it. You dragged me out here, and you don't know anything about it? Why would I know? Moreover... I was not the one who summoned you to the future, it's you. You came to me before you disappeared to ask me to make you a Time thief and said I'd use it to bring back the old you if you cannot come back. The world you can't save is waiting for the current you to save. What an irresponsible guy! Do you have any idea what I went through to do this? You'll take care of everything for me, to save the future. You are quite a troublemaker! You haven't changed no matter when. Blame it on your own bad nature. I don't blame you. Maybe you can't protect the world you're in. But... you protected my world. Why are you in low spirits in the morning? Have you forgotten the deal you made with us and my sister? Pull yourself together! Get to work now! Thank you, bro! I'll take it from here. Let's go. You're not the only ones who made the deal. We need to find out Enmi, crime culprit of all who did this and find a way to save Ms. Tae. Shinpachi, don't worry. We can make it. Let's go! Let's go! Let's not get too far behind. After all these, we couldn't even see the shadow of Enmi. What are you going to do when you find him? Of course I'll kick his ass first. Each one of us will punch him. No... I mean, what are you going to do? What would you be if it all worked out? I'll go back to where I came from, because there are people waiting for me there. You're exactly like that guy. Asked us to reorganize the Yorozuya and then decided to leave us. If it all worked out, will Gin come back? If we get rid of the virus, will Edo go back to its original state? Can I see Gin then? Or after you left, is it time for everyone to split up again? What? I thought you were too cool to work with me like I was a dirty uncle. What now? Do you feel lonely without me? Are you going to keep me at the Yorozuya until Gin gets back? But I'm afraid that's not a good idea. If you and I were living under the same roof right now, it would be... How can I say? Forget the old Kagura, I don't even think of her as a girl, but now she's like Kagura 2.0. A man and a woman live together under one roof, not to mention being gossiped about by the neighbors, if the information bureau gets the wrong idea... Hot Dog. I'm just joking. Don't get me wrong. How? Does this joke get your heart racing? No, it's not the power of the joke level anymore. His heart is not only racing, it's stopping. Hot Dog, come back! Even you're not here, I won't be any different. It would be bad if you did stay. By the time Gin gets back, I'm afraid the Yorozuya is about to collapse. I'm sure there'll be a lot of fuss over the beautiful me. When you're done with your business, you'd better get out of our face. Don't worry. And I'll make sure Gin knows that in his short absence, there was once a useless man like him helping out at the Yorozuya. And I'll tell him that the Yorozuya always has another partner and tell him not to forget. So you also... - This is... - Don't, don't look. No, don't get me wrong. I want to make a statement. I don't have that weird hobby. Hot Dog, was it... Papa. Gin... No, Hot Dog. There's an emergency. The Time Thief has been stolen. Yes, I was so careless. I can't believe it was stolen right after I finished fixing it. Who on earth would do such a thing? The Time Thief footage can be linked to the screen here. I'm sending it to you now. It was this guy. I got a GPS on where he's hiding. Let's get there before he makes a move. Where is he? Where is that guy? He's in the air terminal ruins. Time is running out. Let's split up here. But... Listen, if you find him first, you must call me at once, don't try to be brave alone. Let's go! Finally found you. We've come a long way around each other. All you do is to get back something you forgot 15 years ago. But that's as far as it goes. Even though I lost you before, I want you to give it back this time. For our future, even if I have to pay the price, I will trample on your future. I can't believe he knows my movement. Who the hell are you, man? Don't you want to answer? Then I'll beat the crap out of you until you can't answer me anymore. This guy saw right through my movements. Well then... Well done, White Yasha. I'm not going to make the same mistake again, so you can play dead. I've been waiting too long. And now it's finally over. I should thank you. I've been waiting for your coming, White Yasha. While listening to the sound of the world falling apart, I have been waiting for you. The only person who can beat me is me myself. You... you are... As you can see, I'm Gintoki Sakata after 5 years. Everything that happens in this world is my... No, one day it will start within yourself. In the cells of your sleeping body, there is that guy's curse lurking all along, which is the source of the virus that destroyed this world today. But your hands that invite the curse... will tear apart the people you love and protect one day. This is the karma of being a demon. People who love you or hate you, will be swallowed up because of you. You are alone and crying alone in this world forever, The object you killed was just a container. The noumenon of Enmi is actually a Nanobot virus that's been manipulated. When the container of the noumenon was destroyed by us, it went into us and grew inside of us. For 10 years to analyze the human genetic gene, it used these genetic engineering data to evolve and create a devastating virus the human body can't fight, spreading from the cells of the body to the entire human step by step. When I realized all of these, it's already too late. In order to resist the gradual erosion of self, I decided to leave. I was going to commit seppuku with him, but my body no longer obeys my will. There's nothing I can do. I can only wander around like a zombie and watch the world being destroyed by my own hand and cannot do anything to save it. I think you should understand now. I was trying to eliminate me who caused the world's destruction, so I summoned my old self into this world. Although me in this world would disappear, but... I'm willing to do whatever it takes to get out of the karma loop of the curse, and to save the world. Everything is ready, I'll leave the rest to you. Gintoki Sakata, White Yasha. The only person who can kill me is me myself. Yes? So since 15 years ago, I wasn't supposed to exist, so I wouldn't be a danger to the world? And what am I supposed to do after that? Back to where it all started, the age of Joi war. But I'm running out of energy, you can only go without returning. I guess I don't have to come back anyway. At the moment when Mr. Gintoki beat Enmi, the virus should be destroyed before the Nanobots invade the nerve. It's the only way to save the world for good. So let it infect me first and kill me with it, right? But all the ages since then, Gintoki Sakata's existence will disappear from the world forever. So sorry. I guess I'll never get back to you guys, you need to grow up, Shinpachi, Kagura. Where are you going by yourself? Don't you know? The films... are of no use unless they are fully collected. You need three rolls of film to make sense. It also means the Trinity. This kind of useless thing, we've always been carrying around. For us, it's our last memory with that guy. Maybe someday, there is a chance to make three rolls of film together. But... why did you leave us again? It's been a long time getting to see you, and then you're going to leave us again, leave everyone behind again, and leave alone, Gin, right? Oh my. This booger is not working at all. Trinity? Then believe that there will be a chance to meet again. I'm sure we'll meet again. So just... let me keep it for now. I hope you don't forget about me. Shinpachi, Kagura. Gin! Are you all right? Are you okay? You cheer up please. Here... here is... Is it because Gin has changed the past? Where's Gin? Mr. Hijikata. Mr. Hijikata. Where's Gin? Did you see Gin just now? What? Gin? Who is he? By the way, who are you? How do you know my name? Mr. Gintoki, please forgive me. I am a being created to change the future according to the wishes of your future, so no matter how much sacrifice it takes, I have to save the future, even if it is a future in which you will disappear, I will also... How can something be so easily forgotten? Even if everyone forgets about me, and I will never forget everything. So will you send a message for me? To form the Yorozuya with them, I'm really, really happy. I don't want it to end like this. Gin! Gintoki Sakata from Yorozuya, now I'm here. We... don't want that kind of future. No. Gin! Weird. Why am I crying? Why? 15 years after that day, now it's time not to save the world, but to save Gintoki, just use the data I left. And then it's all over. Right, it's all over. To save you and your hopeless future. It's really dangerous. I'm almost die. Wait. Why would I... Why the handsome Gin will become Useless Man? Do you have any complaint? Anyway, Gin is a useless man... No, that's something that's going to happen a long time later. At this time, Gin should not... By the way, why are you here? I thought you might get a little lonely here by yourself, so I came to you with good wine. But it looks like I may have met another Gin. Your personalities haven't changed at all no matter when. When you saw good wine, you gulped it down. Probably you're too drunk to get up right now. Everyone is drunk because of me, so I decided to take their place. Wait, you said I'm too drunk to get up. What do you mean? Then... All day today, I have never been here at all, right? Well... Enmi is still alive? What the hell have you been up to? I went all the way back in time to change the future. Look! It's White Yasha. Take the head of the White Yasha. What am I supposed to do now? Instead of changing the future, the world is going to end today. The future has already been changed, that's why I'm here. From the future you saved, and a whole bunch of idiots you're going to miss will come. You said the future I saved... Right, so we have to... come from the peaceful future you saved to destroy it all. You risked your life at all costs to save our future, so this time, it's time for us... to return from the saved future to save you. Shinpachi, Kagura, do you really think you can do this kind of thing so easily? With our strength alone... Of course. Now you're not alone anymore. No matter the cursed past or the future, this place is guarded by our Yorozuya. You... you... We had a deal to make sure to pass on your thoughts and spirit to them. Tama, why are you... Time machine. Gin, did you get my present? You've overcome all your cursed past and future, so... Listen, Gintoki, the place you're standing is not just tomorrow and yesterday in the karma loop, it's just common Kabukicho. Get everything done and come back to pay the rent. And my bills... And my native product... I got set up by you guys. Because of all the stupid stuff you guys did, no matter yesterday, today, or tomorrow, ahead or behind, I can't see at all now. But thanks to your care, let me see something else, hope! A place I, this idiot, have to go back to. Let's go, Gin! Let's go. I'll go anywhere with you. What army is that? Just kill them all at once. That's what I want. If you want to take down the head of our Yorozuya's people, if you can do that, you can go ahead and try. The reinforcements are here. "Continue" Sister. What's a woman just recovering from a serious illness doing here? Because I suddenly remember a debt of gratitude that I must repay. I don't remember lending you anything. I can't believe that I changed the future, and accidentally let a great woman get back from hell. Didn't we both just get back from hell? Mr. Demon who destroyed the world. Looks like you got that nasty tongue recovered, too. Thanks to you. Watch out! Tae. Be careful if you infect another disease from him. You don't have to kick me. What disease? Ms. Tae. Whose dxxx did you infect this disease from? It's not what you're talking about. Gintoki. If you ever put Tae in pain again, I will never forgive you. If you try to get out of our face again, none of us will ever forgive you. Kyobee, you... Exactly. The savior of the world from the great evil party that destroyed it, no matter who is pretty the same. But only one thing... next time no matter you fall or get up, I have to be with you. - Ms. Sarutobi. - Tsukuyo. I can't believe you keep me waiting so long, you idiot. You are too slow. So I had to travel back in time to see you. Why can't you face me anyway? Are you that old with so many wrinkles... That's because I'm tired of looking at your downhearted face. Don't get too carried away. Just move on! We'll take it from here. You'll handle the rest of it. Gin! You're going to make it back safe this time, right? What do you mean? I already came back. I feel like an idiot. I should have greeted him the same way I always did. Yeah. How could this look have any way of greeting or sending off properly? Looks like there is not only that guy who came back. Welcome back, everybody. I didn't expect in addition to White Yasha and the Kiheitai, there are other elite members. No matter how powerful they are, facing the curse of our planet destroyer, no one can escape... the shackles of destruction. Damn, it's Bug Poison. That's not going to work anymore. Using the same move over and over again against samurai won't work. Oh my. Shinsengumi is getting worse, in the end decides to join forces with Joi faction against the Bakufu, right? Yamazaki is right. After all, compared to those guys, in this era, they are some of the biggest people active. Don't worry. When all Amantoes are gone, we'll take them all in. Or I wouldn't be here in this age for that guy. Right, Mr. White Yasha. Annoying, you're still working as a police back in time. That's just what I want. In the future after all these things settled down, if you haven't forgotten what happened, I will always be there. Stop kidding! How can I forget something like that? That's right, no matter at the bottom of hell, or the end of time, I'm going to find you out. Don't let them get caught in the Bug Poison. Gintoki. We used to be depressing when we lost a lot of friends. I often feel like... I'll never be the same again. But you wouldn't have thought of it that you will return to this place with us in the end. Gintoki. We'll clear the way for where you're moving forward. So you don't have to do it for the future, you don't have to do it for the past, you just have to do it for yourself and the present that we live in, create your own new path. With that bloody look, the body... is just like a ghost. So you are the White Yasha. You're unable to protect your fellow and then set foot on the road of Shura. But your hands that invite the curse... will tear apart the people you love and protect one day. This is the karma of being a demon. People who love you or hate you, will be swallowed up because of you. You are alone and crying alone in this world forever, White Yasha! You are right. This damn thing is my karma. Why can you still move when you're infected by Bug Poison? If this is the karma I have to bear, then bring it on! I'll bear it! Such a petty curse, no matter how many times, I can bear it in the flesh. Why? How can you resist Bug Poison with your body? Do you already have Bug Poison in your body? Who are you? No matter how many times you beat me, no matter how many times you destroy the world, my world cannot be defeated. I'm not afraid of your curse, just with my arm... and those two idiots, we could easily defeat you. This guy has multiple cores. White Yasha, I didn't expect you're willing to sacrifice yourself to protect your partners. But your curse remains. You still can't protect anything. I'm going to make your life a living hell, watching the people you love die, until this planet... becomes dry and exhausted. Gin! These... these people... maybe... G... Gin! You said I can't protect anything. No. Even this dirty sword, it protects what it's supposed to protect. Gin, that was... I think it was your illusion. I think so. It's all over now. Yeah. How the future will change this time is totally unpredictable. No matter what, we stopped Gin from infecting White Curse, it should be all right after that. I wonder what will happen next. It's just normal. The so-called future, originally is such a thing, right? Whatever future awaits us, as long as you're here, it doesn't matter what happens. This is the important data that I found. So we don't need the Time Machine anymore. Bye, old shit! Hold on. Wait a minute, if without the machine, so how do we get back to where we were? Annoying, Yamazaki. You don't get much of a part. Don't steal scenes and add lines all the time. You don't get much of a part. Don't repeat it twice. And I don't think that's the point. That's the point. You see, with so little part, so your lower half is becoming transparent. What are you saying? Indeed, what the hell? Because we changed the past, the fact that we have skipped time and space disappears. Now we don't exist in space and time, that way we can get back without the Time Machine, And save energy and carbon. Ms. Tama. That's a pretty casual way to go back. I can't believe we'll disappear like that. I was trying to change the past, so I can avoid being laid off by never meeting Gin again... You're a bit over the line to reveal your own feelings, and got disappeared after pissing me off. Damn it, we came here in this age, at least we have to catch Katsura. Katsura, I'm putting you under arrest now. I'm afraid that's not going to happen, because I have to go first. Goodbye, see you. Weird. Excuse me. How did the time jump stop so suddenly? What do you mean? All right, let's cuff you in here for now. After 15 years, I'll come to this place and arrest you. Mr. Hijikata, wait. Please take me with you. Mr. Hijikata, rest in peace here. After 15 years, I'll be back here to make your tombstone. I'll wait for you for 15 years, remember that! So it is. What I do now will not make any subsequent effect. Well, at least enjoy it while I can. Ms. Tae. Master. Even after 15 years, I still love you. Although you get taller, you're still perfect to be a gothic lolita. What I do now will not make any subsequent effect, right? It doesn't, okay? Their lives are gone before they are gone. No, it's so hard to see Gin and then I have to leave him right away. Right, at least give me a goodbye kiss. And then I'm just going to disappear. Is it okay? It's the Final Movie anyway. Well... sorry. Looks like your head is in the Final. Would you please just disappear in silence? Why am I the only one disappearing from the head? This is too much. Just give me my head back. Don't worry, your head is in my hand. But I advise you to go back. How can I not worry? It's not about disappearing anymore. I think you're just trying to get rid of your rival. Well, then we're going to go first. You must be jealous of my kissing with Gin. I might as well sell your body to Yoshiwara. - Goodbye, everyone. - Wait, it's my fault. Please forgive me. Give my body back. Everyone's gone first. Gin, Shinpachi, Sadaharu. Let me take a good look at your faces. In the changed future, even if we can meet, it will not necessarily be the Yorozuya. So maybe this is the last time we get together. Let me remember your faces. Kagura. Is that so? Then take a good look at it, in order to make us meet again, and find each other no matter how far apart. Remember each other's faces while we can. Gin! We will meet again. I promise you, I will always... be waiting for you in Kabukicho under the sign of the Yorozuya. That's the deal. We have to... meet again. Okay, that's the deal. Why are only the glasses missing? Let's go. "Current Situation DESTRUCTION" Singer: SPYAIR BREAK OUT, the long-gone story Alone under a twilight sky Tiny shadows on the road FADEOUT in the huddle I can get used to think about the future BRING ME DOWN Want to make a scene BRING ME DOWN Break up the noise BRING ME DOWN What am I doing? Trying to burn out in pure white Roar at the days that passed by Trying to escape from this dark road I just want to focus on breaking through this the present and live Just for that I don't need anything like that Feeling resentful of being laughed at How can I be loved if I can't laugh? That's better That much is fine Trying to burn out in pure white Roar at the days that passed by Trying to escape from this dark road I just want to focus on breaking through this the present and live Just for that "PRAY" Singer: TOMMY HEAVENLY6 LET'S GO OUT OPEN MY MIND LET'S GO SWEET DREAM OTHER SIDE Now let's get out of the cage A rusty key An unstoppable agitation By the time I find out, I can't go back Lost days HEY BABY WHY Blue links I WANT TO CRY I don't want to lose to the scared self Don't run away from the fate Because you're not alone By your side It doesn't matter how sad the dream is Want brush away your tears BABY I PRAY Trust me I will cleave the darkness filled with cold memories I can't stand you, Gin. What are you doing here? Didn't I tell you we have work to do today? Totally overslept. What? Really? I'm late!
