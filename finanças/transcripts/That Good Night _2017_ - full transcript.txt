The horizon recedes as we go through life. There is always tomorrow, next month, next year. Then a time comes when it stops receding. Benjamin Franklin said that there are three certainties in life, death, taxes and nurses. And the award for Best Screenplay goes to Ralph Maitland. After spending six months on last year's best seller list, Ralph made- Guest tonight has had a distinguished career as a novelist, and a screenwriter. And the DAFTA goes to, Ralph Maitland. I'm delighted to present this award to Ralph Maitland. -Hello. -Hey there. Mrs. Anna. Joanna. Where are you off to this early? Swimming clogs, towel, espadrille. Any clues Ms. Marple? Good. I'm tired of having to spend all day trying to persuade you Well your tactics have paid off. I'm a reformed character. I think you'll find that's addressed to me. Yes. I was just going to pass it to you. Thank you. We need to be at the hospital by 12. Oh yes. Can we make it 11? Really? You shouldn't make such a fuss. You're talking to a reformed character. So, I'll meet you at the cafe. Small espresso, large brandy. How are you, sir? If I knew that I wouldn't be here, would I? Cardiology is down on the left. Thank you. Oh, yeah, it's lovely. -Isn't it? -Perfect. So, special occasion? Yeah, wedding anniversary, 20 years. 20! Okay. You can relax. Hold my hand. Thought you'd never ask. Grip me hard. Not very good at it. You have a great spirit. Ah, that's 'cause I'm an obstinate old dog. It's not the best news. That the society? Maitland here, Ralph Maitland. I want to confirm the appointment for Sunday morning. Yes, this Sunday morning, nine o'clock. Hello? Hello, Michael, it's Ralph. I know it's you. I need to see you. Can you get here next week before Sunday? Yes, it needs to be before Sunday. Sunday's too soon, I'm not sure I can- Well, I'll see you then, then. Right. Okay. Oh, I'm so sorry I'm late. That's fine. Now where is it? Over there. Okay. Well, at least the colors are new. Well, it's still another naked woman. I think it's very sensual. What do you think? I think he needs to get out more. That's what I think. -Well who doesn't? -Who doesn't, who doesn't? Your tablets. Oh thank you. Don't work too late. I spoke with Michael, by the way. Really? I think he should be paying us a visit. When? This weekend. Oh, it's been a long time. I'll book a table at Maria's then. Mm hmm. Good morning, Mr. Ralph, sir. It'd be a damn slight better if I didn't have to swim like Johnny Weissmuller every bloody morning. I've been thinking, Mr. Ralph. Oh yeah. -When you finish your book, -Yeah? Perhaps you write an action movie. I have a good idea. There is this giant monster. He live in a volcano. And he wake up after 1000 years. That's been done to death. You need something fresh, something less derivative. Derivative? That's it. Keep thinking. Ralph, Michael's flight has landed. I'm going to meet him. Okay. Who is Michael, mister? He's my son. He a big story writer like me? Oh yes. He's a big, big story teller. 48 to go, mister. I know. I know. For you, Mr. Ralph. Ronaldo. Hey, is that the fellow that brought the letters? There is nobody there, Mr. Ralph. Huh? Oh. I've been thinking. Again? I have better idea for a film. There is this fish, very big, like a car. He live in the water but he can climb out on the land. And in the sky there is a flying fish. Look Michael, there he is. I not Michael. Turning and turning in the widening Jaya. The Vulcan cannot hear the Vulcan. Things fall apart. The center cannot hold mere anarchy. It's loosed upon this world. What is anarchy? Well, it's either insurrection or pandemonium. Or it is the absolute freedom of the individual to do precisely what he wants. So tell me, are you both writers? No. One's enough. Yeah actually Cassie's hosting a conference down in Seville. We were meant to be there now. And out of the blue Ralph called, demanded I came and saw him immediately. Yeah, I know I he has his own way of doing things. But he really does want to see you. To be honest, he messed up our plans a bit. Not really. It's fine. I love bushk. Right. Shall we get this over and done with? Is this it? Oh yeah, I forgot you've not been here before. Like I said, he wasn't much into families. God. I'm dreading this It can't be that bad. It can be pretty difficult. Well one step outta line and he gets it in the nuts. So welcome to our home. Wow. What a view. Ralph working is he? Yeah, always. But it's so quiet. Oh I used to like that noisy tie fighter he had. You remember Michael? So please have a seat. 12 o'clock on the dot he'll appear, So what's he working on? He won't tell me. Why don't you ask him, Michael? He'll tell you. I'm sure. Oh, there you go, 12 o'clock on the dot. Hello Ralph. Michael. Anna said you were well, you're looking good. -Am I? -How are you feeling? One thing I've learned, when people ask how you are feeling all they want to hear is fine. Tell 'em how you're really feeling, their eyes glaze over. Mine won't. How are you feeling? Fine. Who's she? Yeah, someone I want you to meet. Cassie, this is my father, Ralph. Hello Ralph. Ralph already. -Uh oh... -Cassie. Cassie. Didn't know you were bringing someone, bringing a friend. Would anyone like anything? Large brandy. He does this to annoy me. Well, do I get one? You said anything. Of course not. Why don't you come and sit with us in the shade. You're in the sun there. Oh, I've been sitting in the blasted shade all morning. He just works too much. Always acts like he has a deadline to work to. I do, the ultimate deadline. Ralph, please. Alright. Hey. It's always the same with him. The elation of creation and then the morbid gloom when he stops. How would you know, you've never done it. I think a lot of writers live on an emotional roller coaster. I didn't realize that that was your field of expertise. What about some nice, cool drinks? Yes. Can I do anything? Yeah. Go and help her. Absolutely not. Please just relax. And you, my darling, behave yourself. Just as well that I'm a tolerant and forgiving, man. She's power mad, you know. I really like her. Oh do you really? After all of a few minutes. Yeah, liked her on sight. And you tend to like people on sight quite a lot, do you? Sometimes. Or dislike them. Oh, I guess we have something in common. What's Cassie short for? Cassandra. The Greek prophetess whom nobody believed. Now let me think, how did she die? Perhaps I will go and help Anna. That's a good girl. What was that? I said thank you, sweetheart. So how long have you had the gallery? Four years. I really like this picture. Yeah, it's one of my favorites You guys look really happy together. You are impossible to get hold of. I take it it was for precise reason. Yes, it was. Well we had to change our flights. Couldn't it have waited until next week? Nope. Before Sunday, you're very precise. Why? Because I have to make a decision. A decision about what? Whether to leave you, escape my prison at last. You'd imagine a clever man like Ralph could have organized his escape long before now wouldn't you? Success is within my grasp, you'll see. This is his idea of humor, you know. It takes all sorts. He doesn't realize that people who don't know him might think he means it. Anna, you are beginning to piss me off. Cassie, let me show you the garden. We have this extraordinary little stream, it dries up in the summer. You'll probably wish you'd never come. I'm pretty good at handling men. -Oh? -I mean, I've got -three older brothers. -I see. Yeah. My poor mother. Do you have any children? Oh, watch out. So when we are going to the stream, it's this way. You're going onto Seville. Yeah, Cassie has a conference and then I head down to Malaga. Oh. There's a new co-production shooting in Spain. I see. Drama called "Midnight Cavalier". Bare chested, hairy hunks on horse back, that sorta thing? Yeah, yeah. Well it's selling well in Germany, France and Spain. Steamy sex scenes with busty girls? I'm the lead writer. Who act with their mouths open. Is that where Cassie fits in? Not at all. Is that really what you want to do? The money's good. Mephistopheles made much the same point of Faust. I seem to remember. Yeah well I can sympathize with Faust. But Michael, you have talent. You don't have to do that crap. Look, I'm happy doing things on my own. Crazy. I could have helped. When have you ever helped? Well I've always done everything I could. Who do you think paid for your education? You cost me plenty old song. But that's just it. You were just a signature on a check. You never gave a shit. Well if you feel that deeply, then why don't you write about it? You think I haven't tried. Well nobody said it would be easy. Try harder. You know, sometimes I wonder why I'm even here. It's not as if abortion was illegal back then. Oh for Christ's sake, Michael. I mean, you always got your own way with everything. Oh please. One check, it could've all been sorted out. Oh, you're like a dog with a bone. It must have really pissed you off, not being able to get rid of me. Why? Because your mother set out deliberately to get pregnant. And the last thing she wanted was an abortion. Satisfied? But you wanted me aborted. Right? Do you even know how old I was when you first saw me? I was five. Your mother all right for money? She's fine. Good. That's one query crossed off the agenda. Agenda, what agenda? Mine. Michael, I needed to speak to you because I'm trying to settle... We're coming to join you boys. Settle what? Not now, not now. It's quite hot for April. Did you show what's her name, the dried up stream? Yes, what's her name thought it was lovely. You should really talk to Cassie. She's got a PhD in social anthropology. I specialize in the reconstruction of cultural heritage after conflict. You know, that sounds absolutely mind numbingly boring. Right? We should go and check in. Yeah. Oh don't you want to stay for lunch? No, we're not hungry. But thanks. We'll see you tonight. See you tonight. Michael, I forgot. Before you leave, this is for you. Get a move on. You don't want to go? Hey. He was always generous with his money, but never affection. Just cold. "You may have noticed that my wrists "are a bit scrawny these days. "So I leave you my beloved Rolex. "Love you son, Dad." What? Nothing. Hey, maybe he'll behave himself 'cause he's in a restaurant. I think you could make a bit more of an effort with Cassie. It didn't occur to me that he'd be bringing a girl. Oh he has. Michael seems really happy with her. I admit she's quite a good looker but I don't like her. Ralph, get over it. I do, I like her. Yeah, you look really good in this shirt. Thank you. Are you sure you're up for this? There's food involved, I'm in. Thank you. So tell me, how did you guys get together? Oh, he was filming in the city where I lived and he got a heart attack and I worked at a hospital and he was this man of the world. So it was a hospital romance? -Yeah. -I need a large brandy. Shut up, Ralph. It was romantic. Internationally acclaimed screenwriter laid low by a coronary assault, a near death encounter, which leaves him vulnerable and confused. His devoted Catholic nurse, keen to escape a life of drudgery, espies her chance and pounces on her helpless prey. Oh, I think you were the one who did the pouncing. My family was strongly against it. So we practically had to elope. -Oh, scandalous. -Yes. He had quite a reputation as a womanizer. Oh, happy days. My family was so shocked. "Why him Anna? He's such a terrible old goat." And of course they were right. From her own lips. But I knew I could tether him. Actually he was quite easy to house train. -Really? -Yeah. Your little friend is endeavoring with very little success to restrain her incredulity. Maybe she's one you up. Ha. Why don't you tell Michael what you're working on? Sure, what's the subject of your new script, Ralph? It's a story of a life or death decision. Like eating Michael's cooking. -What? -Just joking. She's just joking. Yes, but I'm talking about a serious drama. All right. -So anyway. -Just joking. So how long is your break? It's not long enough, 'cause we're back to work Monday. Oh so you have a proper job? Yes. For whom? A small company run by a group of friends. Doing what exactly? We organize scientific conferences. Oh and you're employed as? I'm one of the hosts. Well forgive me. But in my day a smiling attractive young girl, dare I say not unlike yourself would accost one in the bar, ply one with drinks and be most agreeable. Even solicitous one might say, that sort of thing. Leading scientists arrive from all across the world. We look after them, make introductions. And you're nice to them. Well we're not paid to be nasty to them. Of course not, sweetheart. You're a professional hostess. So Michael arrived at one of your conferences and you were nice to him and you carry on being nice to him out of hours so to speak. Now Ralph, please. Really Anna, it's fine. No, it's not fine. But he doesn't mean it. I've dealt with far worse. I bet you have. I merely profit a job description. Look, I don't care what you think about me. But what you're really saying is that all your son deserves is a cheap tart. Now I've never met a man with such compassion and integrity. I guess they both come from his mother. I'm gonna go, if that's okay. -Goodnight. -Goodnight. I'm gonna go too. Oh no, no. Michael, don't go. I've still things I've got to say, I think you've said it enough. Look, I didn't ask you to bring this. Shut up. You, you despicable... Sorry, Anna, this isn't your fault. Michael! Do something, Anna. Stop him. Cassie. I don't know what to say. Don't say anything. When I was 13 Ralph bought a fancy boat, announced that it would be like some family vacation. So mom and I, we drove all the way down to Saint-Tropez and the boat was there, but no sign of Ralph. We waited two weeks and he didn't show. Why did you have to do it? She was here all day. Soon as she arrived I knew everything had gone wrong. I knew I wouldn't get the chance- You, you had every chance. I wanted to talk to my son alone. Yeah. And I took Cassie away. And all you did was argue. Why do you have to make everything so impossible? Let's go home, shall we? What else can we do? I made friends with the French boy on the next boat. He wrote to me later, said that after we left, Ralph turned up with some blonde on his arm. I never did tell my mom that. I've been thinking. Are you hiding something? No. I just seem to be very aware of my own mortality. Stupid. I know. You have good many years left. Something deeply hidden has to be behind things. -Said who? -Albert. -Einstein. -Of course. It needn't be deeply hidden. It's easy for you. You have faith. One thing that I want, at the point of my departure, even if there's nothing to follow, I would like a moment of understanding. I'd like that. You're not going to die now. We all have to die sometime. Simple arithmetic says that I'll go long before you do. Could be any time. I hate it when you talk like this, I hate it. The future arrives, it always arrives. We don't know what lies ahead. I could choke to death on a peanut and you'd be the one left alone. Don't eat peanuts then. No, I do worry about leaving you alone. I'm concerned for you. You're concerned for me? Yes, of course. But don't you see? I wouldn't be alone. Oh, not that again. You knew how I felt. Look, I mean, time and time again. We can't go on having the same conversation every other year. You knew exactly- Yeah, that you didn't want children. Yes, you made that very clear, but you knew that I did. And it means nothing to you. Please. So yes. Now you're all I have. You made sure of that. Come on. Let's go swimming. You are so drunk. Will you marry me? You think I want to be part of your dysfunctional family. I'll take that as a no, then. Ask me again when you're sober. I wasn't that bad, was I? So Cassie, will you marry me? I need to tell you something first. I'm pregnant. What? Well, now you're gonna have to marry me. Anna? Anna? She go to church, Mr. Ralph. -Ah. -You need something? Hey. You know where she hides the good stuff? Get me a nice glass of brandy, large one. How about a smoothie, Mr. Ralph. Very good for you. Oh. For you. Now I write big stories like you, Mr. Ralph. Very big. My pleasure. Hi, this is Michael's phone. Leave me a message and I'll get back to you. Thanks. Good morning, sir. Morning. You are? From The Society. You were expecting me. Expecting someone? Me sir, the local man. Local? You sound distinctly English to me. Well I'm a citizen of the world. I reside in Seville, but I have clients here in Portugal. Thus your local man. I didn't hear a car. I parked at the bottom of the hill. You like your visits to remain secret. Well most clients prefer that I find. I take it we're alone? Yes, my wife has gone to church. Well might I ask how you came to contact The Society. Information for research purposes you could say. Hmm, well, it's a privilege to meet you. I've always greatly enjoyed your writing. You're novel, a navigator, a man in midlife, disillusioned, his ideals corrupted by commercialism, weary of loveless affairs. I wrote that decades ago, Ah, but a tantalizing ending. The young woman he meets, did she change him? Did they become lovers? You leave it all so unrevealed. Very clever. Look, I have a very low boredom threshold. I don't do small talk. Shall we move outside? Yes, of course. There is a consultation fee. Thank you. I guess your services are only available to those who can afford it. Well, The Society adopts something of a Robin Hood principle. For those in financial difficulty there is no fee. Of course, that doesn't apply to you. -Please. -Thank you. Now, so what do I call you? Doctor? Titles, open up a gulf. Wouldn't you say? Struck off, were you? What for, a drink, women, unlawful killing? An aggressive attitude generally indicates a defensive client. Or is it simply your low boredom threshold? That says that I have a right to know who I'm dealing with. It's a policy of The Society that operatives remain discreetly anonymous. Let's just say I enjoyed a successful career in my specialist field, but I came to believe that life at all costs was a modern heresy. That we can cheerfully end life by abortion, hundreds of thousands annually, but once born life is sacrosanct, but for some, it becomes a mockery. They ask for relief, the right to make their own decision. And it is withheld, wrongly I believe. In my professional capacity I could do nothing. Now through The Society I can help. Tell me how exactly. We'll start with a case assessment. Personality, reasons, mental state. I'm only researching a character in a film script for God's sake. Well, of course, but let's strive for authenticity. Describe him or her to me. -Him. -Mm hmm. Age? Elderly. -Senile? -Certainly not. Well, I mean it wouldn't work dramatically. Of course, not, no. Health issues. -Heart. -Longstanding? Yes, you are a doctor, aren't you? He's had open heart surgery. Well, are all his faculties intact? Yes and no. Which? He is aware they're fading. A failing memory. Lapses in concentration looses the thread sometimes, yeah? Not all the time. Occasionally. Resents growing old. Not so much the passage of years, more the gradual loss of mobility. Physical, intellectual? Complex equation. And these are the reasons for your character's decision. Yeah? Motives, as I see them. What I need to know is the method that you would recommend. Well, what comes to mind in this hypothetical case is that the individual will be currently taking drugs. Oh no, no, no drugs, nothing like that. Well surely he must have access. His wife gives him his drugs. She was a nurse. So if she suspected that he would plan to take his life, then she will be greatly distressed. He needs a way that would leave no trace. Well our services ensure that there would be no autopsy. It would appear to be natural causes. Good. So how? Simply injection. -Pain? -No. Just sleep, in seconds actually. All over. However, in a case like this, I would advise counseling. Counseling? Oh no. I told you he's made his decision. He doesn't want bloody counseling. The trouble with his decision is that it is irreversible. He doesn't want it reversed. I'm not convinced of that. You! Great. He's a rational man. He's thought it out. The man I see, the one you've put to me, has problems, yes, but he may have them out of proportion. And a few counseling sessions. It's well worth a try. At the appropriate fee. Little enough for an acceptable life extension. He doesn't want it extended. How many times do I have to- Like a few weeks counseling and he might- Look, as a technical advisor you are bloody useless. Possibly, but unlike you, I don't much deal in fiction you see. This is my consultant's diagnosis. Hmm. I'm told she's rather good. And damn pretty, too. Still set on counseling? It depends. You see sometimes when people feel very sorry for themselves- No, he doesn't. There is no rage against the dying of the light. -Dylan Thomas. -Yes, quite. And what did he know? He died before he was 40. When you get old, you're not afraid to die or afraid that you won't die in time. So in the case of our a fictional character... He's ready. That should take care of the risk, shouldn't it? You do like to place your faith in the power of cash, don't you? More than adequate. I could call again in a day or so. No no, do it now. What about your wife? Oh much better for her. How do you know? Trust me, I know. Very well. When you dispatch people like this, It's rarely like this. Well when you facilitate their departure. Well I suppose I can't challenge that. Where do you think you're sending 'em? You mean, do I believe in an afterlife? -Yeah. -I know that I do not know. But you don't deny the possibility. That would be remarkably arrogant. And you? Much the same. I'm not sure how I feel about eternal life. How does one pass the time in eternity? I'll soon know one way or the other. We could continue this discussion on Monday if you wish. Will you have the answer by then? No. Then what's the point in waiting? Are you ready? Yes. Count backwards from 10. Nine, eight, seven, six... We should really sleep. Ah, we'll sleep when we're dead. You should call your dad. Yeah. Ralph, Ralph. Phone! I'm back. Why didn't you answer the phone? Ralph. Ralph, Ralph, wake up. Ralph? Ralph! Wake up, Ralph. Ralph. Anna. Ralph? Why are you here? I live here, stupid. Seriously? I'm looking at a daft old man. How many times must I tell you, don't fall asleep in the sun? Please. What's this? Huh? Have you been stung? Huh? Yeah, you have been stung. You bet I have. The perfect sting. I love it. What on Earth are you laughing at? I don't know. I leave you here for five minutes. I think the sun has baked your brains. ♪ Mad dogs and Englishmen ♪ ♪ Go out in the midday sun ♪ You've been drinking. No. Yes you have. Why didn't you answer the phone? I didn't hear a thing. Oh, you were dead to the world. Why yes, it seems to have been like that. It could have been Michael. What could? The phone. He's no intention of calling me. I guess you're right. Another character cut from the cast list of my life. How can you be so nasty? Lifetime of practice. Thank you. Aren't you having one? No thanks, I'm fine. I like this spot. Me too, we should sit here more often. Yeah, we should. I'm sorry. For what? A lot of things. Good morning ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the International Symposium of Anthropology and Clinical Herbology. We would be grateful if all can proceed to reception for registration and plastification. Thank you,. Ralph? Ralph, see you later. Michael, it's Anna. I really need to see you I'm on my way to Seville. I know how you feel, but things aren't quite right with him. He's been so strange lately. What is it? I don't know. Did you see his handshake? How he walks? That's not just a heart condition. What, do you think it's something else? I thought he was just aging, but please. -Fine. -Thank you. Rabbit food. Mm. Michael! Yeah, see you boys later. There are some things that I needed to say to you. Things I think you should know. I may have something to say too. The horizon recedes as we go through life. I mean, there's always tomorrow, there's always next month, next year. But there comes a day when the horizon stops receding. Mine has stopped. Quite soon I shall die. Not that that's a great event in your scheme of things. I know that I've never played any great role. You've never seen what you were to me. My father was this remarkable writer and it meant the world to me. You mean my success? No, no. It's what you wrote, it was truthful. Quite an epitaph. But you never shared that side of you with me. It belonged to someone that I never knew, you know? I still don't. Well, I do want to share something with you. You're a good writer. How would you know? I have my ways. Look, I had a facility, that's all. I could work fast and make it seem easy. Would you have a quick read of my work in progress? It's not finished, some 60 odd pages. You're sure you want me to? It's in there. Print it out. What you said before, How soon is quite soon? Not long. But I thought the heart opportunity was a success. It was, 'til they did a checkup, discovered something else and a body scan confirmed it. There must be something they can do. No. Does Anna know? No. Don't you think you should tell her? No, it will only make her unhappy. It isn't very honest, is it? Better than a just happens, all over quickly. Kinder to her. -Anyway. -Yeah. Off you go, 60 pages max. Good luck. What the hell? I was in the vicinity. Your wife's car was not outside. I presumed you were alone. You've got a bloody nerve. I advised you to reflect, said that I would call again in a day or so. Is that why you're here? I'm extremely wary of impulsive decisions when dealing with matters so final. What was it, Diazepam? Percodan? Just a little something to induce sleep. Are you sorry you woke up? No. Well there you are. I suspected we might have a change of heart. Oh I didn't say that. No? No, I have someone here that I'd... given up hope of seeing again. Ah, well then my small deception evidently served a good purpose. Temporary reprieve. We know my prognosis, don't we? The pain can be controlled. Always drugged up to the eyeballs and wasting away? Bedridden. In time, but care can be provided. And inflict my suffering on my wife? No, I won't do that. Anna is... What? My best friend. Do you want to deprive Anna of your last few months together? It's a time to talk, to express feelings. I loathe long goodbyes. I wasn't thinking of you. The surviving partner can often draw comfort and strength from those last weeks. What? Not much of a salesman, are you? You think you can oblige me? If that's what you really want. Yes, that is my final wish. -Now? -No. Someone here, my son. Ah. Michael. Who you feared you would never see again. I need to make my peace with him. Then I'll be ready. I love the flight of birds of prey. Aged man is but a paltry thing. A tattered coat upon a stick. Unless Soul clap its hands and sing, and louder sing. Well? Yeah, it's good. I like it. -Honestly. -Yeah. Were you talking to someone? I heard voices. So did Saint Joan, look what happened to her. No, the opening's really solid. Yeah, I can't wait to read the rest. You're such a liar. It's terrible. Oh, it's not that bad. Stop looking so shifty and sit down. Tell me honestly. I do value your opinion. Well, it could do with a bit more work. Oh, come on. I know the truth. Then why get me to read it? What was it, some kind of integrity test? Oh, not at all. You have a kindness that I lack. I knew what you'd say. It's not that bad, it's a good idea. Oh rubbish. I just don't have it anymore. The essential it. Actually there's something I suppose I should tell you. Cassie's pregnant. What? Pregnant. Yours? Yes, of course. Well, no problem. How much do you need? Nothing. Oh, don't be silly. Good gynecologists are expensive. Please let me pay for that. I'm happy to. Look, forget I ever told you. I should have known which way your mind would turn. Christ's sake. What is wrong now? We want to keep it. You do? Yes of course, we're both very happy. You're turning me into a bloody grandfather. Looks like it. A grandchild. Yeah. Well I'll be damned. Yeah, thanks. I'll be damned. And you're both happy about it? We're thrilled. I just, I never expected you to be so pleased. Well I wouldn't have predicted that either. but now that it's happened, I am. I'm totally thrilled. That girl is carrying my immortality and she's quite a looker, by the way, Michael. Yeah, I think so too. Well, bit selfish, but good news is thing on the ground lately. Yeah, I know. It's nice to have your approval for a change. Well I'll have to change my will to include him. No, that's not why I told you. Oh no no, no of course not. Not but I mean have to leave the little bastard something. Actually he or she won't be. Won't be what? A little bastard as you so eloquently put it. No, we're getting married. When? Soon. Am I invited? Oh, no, of course not. I don't suppose that she would tolerate me. Do you ever think of anybody but yourself? No, you didn't impress her much. She thinks you're a bit of a tosser. Well, I'm a bit of a tosser. But will you bring Cassie to see me, please? Well, you're in luck. She'll be on her way. Well I'm glad to see you're wearing the Rolex. I bought that for myself to celebrate your birth. You really are a perverse old bugger. What have I done now? So when is he due, my grandson? That's a good question. I guess about six or seven months. What do they know? Perhaps I can confound medical science. I might even be able to beat the bloody thing. Oh, that'll be Anna either way. Put that away. Make yourself scarce for a bit. Where is he? Oh, hello darling, that's quick. Where's Michael? Michael? I don't know, I don't see him around here. You've done it again, haven't you? You evil old man. I hate it. Hi. I was thinking if you wanted to, -we could... -What? Work on your script together. You and me together? Yeah, co-writers. That'd be fun. On your head be it. It's Cassie. She's on her way. Now I have to face the music. Anna is going to love this. -Love what? -Never mind. So Michael, why didn't you stay for dinner? Cassie's coming. Oh, I see. No, no, Ralph wanted her to. And I shall be charming as always. So if there's enough, we'd love to stay. Good, I'll light the barbecue then. And you my darling, you haven't had your swim, have you? No, not yet, but I shall. I just need to put a bottle of Moet on ice. Oh, you better tell her the bad news. What bad news? Cassie's pregnant and getting we're married. Really? Yeah. It's weird. But he seems totally thrilled by the prospect of a grandchild. It's really exciting. I must make a salad. Hang in there, granddad. Don't touch me. I'm making a salad. That's probably Cassie. I know my lines. Well done, Dad. Dad? That's nonsense. I've left them to it. Anything I can do? Oh no. Or actually you could take the fish out to the fridge. Okay. There we go. I think I didn't say congratulations before. I'm so sorry. It's okay. I was just overwhelmed, but it's wonderful. Congratulations. Thank you. Should you be the one doing lengths? Well I would be. But I'm on lifeguard duty at the moment. I'm a very good swimmer, I'll have you know. I just want to say, I'm sorry. Behaved like a pig, sorry. I didn't quite catch that. Sorry. Behaved like a pig. You're forgiven. I'm sure it's going to be a boy. You, Michael and the baby, it's just the best news. I'm totally thrilled. Here. Don't want you getting cold. Oh, thank you. Hey, it's your turn, Granddad. Yeah. Oh I hope you did the decent thing and drowned the old devil. We've made up. Good. Dinner smells nice. Yeah, might even taste good. If you're lucky. Ralph? Ralph. Food in five minutes. Message received loud and clear. Do you mind keeping a quick on these? I'm just gonna grab some more. Anna! Anna! Mike, your dad! Michael! Anna! Ralph! Dad? It's okay, I got you. I've got you. Oh I'll call an ambulance. It's okay, relax. Okay, you're gonna be all right now. All right, all right. Hello? I need an ambulance. One, two, three. Just lay down Dad, lay down. -Got him. -You all right? -Can't breathe. -Okay. Just hang on. Michael I, oh. Calm down, you're gonna be fine, Dad. You're gonna be fine. Anna! Ralph? -Dad! -Ralph? -Dad! -Anna! Anna! Quick. Quickly, quickly. -Sit down. -I can't. I shoulda gone in. I should be in there. Hey, he's gonna be okay. So it's a motor neurone disease. Wait, what is? Your husband's condition. We called it ALS. He's got ALS? Yes, it's a terminal condition. I'm afraid there's nothing we can do. The prognosis is six months. Could be less. Could you tell the doctor I'd like to have a word when she has a moment? Of course. I thought I'd lost a client. I gather you tried to take matters into your own hands. Not to be recommended. So, tell me Doctor, in your professional opinion do you think I'll last six months? With the right care and determination. Oh I'm determined all right. I have a very good reason you see. An unexpected visitor. Yes. Very small one, around October. Happy anniversary, my darling. Oh. Oh! Yeah, that really suits you. You have impeccable taste. Yeah, 'til it comes to men. So we bring scene 94 forward? Yes, then we can delete that rather clumsy scene that seems obstinately to have remained It's time again. Thank you, darling. Actually, I am got some good news this morning. They're gonna do a second series of my show. Oh. So Cassie and I'll be back in Malaga, which means that's where the baby'll be born. Eh, well, it's not too far. Good hospitals. We'll be there. Yeah, of course. Congratulations. I write a big story for Mr. Ralph. Oh, you did? How is Mr. Ralph this morning? Sleeping more and more. Tell him, maybe he'll come today. Yeah, that will really cheer him up. I'll do that. Hey, we've had a baby boy. Yeah and Cassie and him are doing amazing. I think we've probably gotta keep him in there overnight. Hello handsome. I'm a granddad. How small he is. Boys. Do not go gentle into that good night. Old age should burn and rave at close of day. Rage, rage against the dying of the light. Though wise men at their end know dark is right, because their words had forked no lightning, they do not go gentle into that good night. Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight, and learn too late, they grieved it on its way. Do not go gentle into that good night. And you, my father, there on the sad height, curse, bless me now with your fierce tears, I pray. Do not go gentle into that good night. Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
