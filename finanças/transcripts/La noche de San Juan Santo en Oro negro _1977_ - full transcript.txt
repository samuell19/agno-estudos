The Night of San Juan Santo in Black Gold Take this to access room Beginning operation Black Gold in the Caribbean sector This is a special message, come back once you deliver it Yes, yes, of course Yes Chief, I've sent word. Goodbye Listen here sir, you can't come in here like this! What do you want? Very well, I agree to buy stocks in the Middle East Yes, with a police inspector please It's an emergency! A suspicious man just came in here I belong to the terrorist organization that is directed by our supreme leader Aquarius Starting today you must pay a fee of 50 cents for every barrel of crude oil that is extracted from your wells You're crazy The first payment of this tax should be made in bills of different denominations and placed inside a waterproof plastic container which you will place in a boat that you will abandon in the high seas at parallel 18, 68 degrees northwest of Puerto Rico You have a deadline of 10 days to fulfill this order, if you don't you will suffer acts of terrorism in all your oil installations Here he is, arrest him! When we went down to see that madman's body it had disappeared This shows us that it was no joke, rather a real matter Just with the ship and the oil well being burned we've lost several millions of dollars. At this rate we'll be ruined Yes, the problem is very serious Look, I think our proposition is a good one Santo In exchange for your help in destroying that terrorist group, for every barrel of crude oil that comes out of our oil wells we'll give 5 cents to feed hungry children all over the world Before coming to see you we made the same proposition to the Red Cross, on the condition that you destroy Aquarius and his terrorist organization, of course You've become the champion of just causes Santo, who better to help the children of the world? Very well, I accept. You couldn't have found a better way to convince me We were sure that would convince you Santo - When can you spring into action? - Right now For the moment you should prepare the first money delivery to the terrorists - What did you say? - You must be joking I never joke This very day I'll send my instructions to your hotel that you must follow to the letter This is a very delicate mission and I'll need all your help We trust you Santo, count on us Here you have the names, pictures and information on the members of our company Good luck Santo Prepare my luggage, I feel that this mission will be the most dangerous of my career Yes, of course. Yes Chief Yes sir, I understand Yes sir, all your orders are being carried out Santo will have the best protection in Puerto Rico But please tell me, what's this about? It's the first time in my law enforcement career that I can't grasp what's going on What did you say? Yes sir, I understand I'll stick to following orders Ms. Ortiz What are you waiting for to find agent Octavio Landa, it's urgent But you never told me to! Well now I have! Alright, come up Mr. Artigas, I've been waiting for you for 10 minutes For which I ask for forgiveness 10 thousand times Ms. Vanessa Oh Enrique, you're so kind Forget about formalities and let's have a drink You've had a lot of work lately but you refuse to listen to me I don't understand You know I've always loved you Vanessa, but since your father- Oh Enrique, please I've told you that I recognize that since you've managed my assets since my my father's death my business has prospered, I recognize it and am grateful, but that anything else between you and- Let me go! What do you want? Enrique! Help me Enrique! Mr. Artigas! Mr. Artigas! What happened? We're security officers in charge of protecting Ms. Vanessa, where is she? We were attacked by strangers, they took her I couldn't catch them, they loaded her into a car I told you, she's been kidnapped! Enrique, are you alright? Good evening ladies and gentlemen, the Sombrero Club is pleased to bring before you that marvel of a woman that night after night delights us all with her incomparable figure and her fiery temperament The one and only, the sensational vedette, the incomparable Martha Cristal, the Goddess of Fire You don't know how happy I am to see you again Santo Me too Martha, especially when every day you grow lovelier and that now you've become such a star So tell me, are you sure the man you saw in the cabaret is the same one that's supposed to be in jail? Of course, his picture was in all the newspapers Could it just be someone who looks like him? Keep in mind that the lights- Martha, are you hurt? You should be asking him - You weren't expecting this, right? - I was, just not so soon I didn't know you were so good at karate, my congratulations One of my suitors taught me, and since you've never wanted to show me a single hold... Like this one for example? Forgive me Santo, I've always dreamed of this moment It won't happen again I understand, thanks anyway Listen, in the cabaret I knew it was you because of the flower you gave me but that's not your real face, is it? What do you think I look like? Different than that That's right. Let's go You're crazy, I'll fall! Here it is, just as was ordered As you can see I missed no detail requested Everything is fine Inspector, thank you I'll give your work the best commendations Well, it was nothing Come in Come in Octavio, we were waiting How's it going Santo? I'm grateful you chose me for this mission, I really wanted to work with you again Me too Octavio. Did you read my instructions? I've even memorized them, as is my habit By the way, you mention in them that you have another contact in Puerto Rico, may I know who it is? I can't tell you for now, it's a way of protecting my colleagues He doesn't know who my other contact is either Very well Santo, we won't speak of it again And now returning to matters at hand, last night I was informed that they attacked the Queen of Black Gold, Vanessa del Valle, in her Manhattan apartment Was she alone? No, she was her administrator Enrique Artigas, a true financial genius I have her information but not his Get them, and by the way, I need to know where this came from and if possible learn who made this suit Here's a bit of the manufacturer's label, that will make your job easier Don't worry Santo, I'll start investigating right away Will you let me know once and for all what you're talking about? This is the first time I've actively taken part in a case that I know nothing about Don't get impatient Inspector, I'll let you know everything when the time is right For now I just want you to know that your help is essential for this mission's success Did you get the documents I asked for so I can visit the prison? Here's everything just as you asked for - So long - Take care Santo Damnit! Everyone knows everything except me! I only remember that I struggled desperately to get away from those men and that they let me go when they heard a police siren in the distance It was horrible Before they fled, one of the, possibly the leader, told me if we didn't pay the tax they demanded they'd finish us off one by one I think that while he's investigating those terrorists, we should make the first payment like Santo recommended Why don't we wait a bit? Those bandits won't get their way so easily And make ourselves targets for their reprisals? No, we should follow the instructions that Santo, the Man in the Silver Mask gave us to the letter You're talking about the famous Mexican wrestler? Yes, the same. Mr. Robles and I asked for assistance from the World Security Council and they recommended him. Do you have some objection? No no, to the contrary, it seems like a very good suggestion I'm opposed to giving a single cent to those criminals! Calm down my love It's very brave of you to think like that, but we're not going to risk your safety nor that of any member of the board Mr. Antijas is right Miss, for now we should pay just as Santo said And by the way, I'd like to talk to him, I have a few suggestions to give him, where can I see him? He's investigating in San Juan, Puerto Rico Then we'll go see him in San Juan Vanessa, it'll be like a vacation Mr. Robles and I also wanted an interview with Santo so we'll meet you there Here you are Perfect, everything is in order Father You didn't have to explain so much As you can see, it's just a simple routine inspection from a mission belonging to the Red Cross If you only knew what good results these visits have had on inmates, it's like they recieve an injection of optimism and hope, that it helps them serve their sentence and to think seriously on reforming It seems like a stupendous idea Gonzalo, tell Sergeant Perez to accompany the chaplain, to show him the sections of the building and to make sure to avoid any incidents Be careful Father, there's many dangerous men in there Thank you, don't worry The drug addicts are here, the terrorists are over there Father, Father! Please help my friend, he's had an attack and no one will help him Sergeant, please open the door, I have to help that man Welcome Father We were anxious to meet you We didn't know chaplains liked spending time in cabarets and seducing dancers with flowers So it'd be better if you tell us who you are and what it is you're looking for This is just a small taste of what could happen if you don't talk You're not human beings Who's the mastermind controlling you? Are you programmed to answer? Absolutely, just as your death is programmed for today, that's why you may learn that we are electromagnetic men created by the genius Aquarius who controls our lives periodically How many robots like you has the genius Aquarius created to form his terrorist organization? 200, but he creates and destroys us as he wishes We can go to- What happened? Keep talking We recieved word from New York that Santo, the Man in the Silver Mask, is in Puerto Rico investigating our organization as an agent of the World Security Council. What do you know of this? A lot I'll tell you if you answer two questions I'm programmed to respond to any of them Is the director of this prison Aquarius himself? No But he knows of this secret place No, the organization constructed it but if it were discovered we'd destroy it and hide in the prison You're right, it's the best place to hide from the police Now answer: where is Santo, the Man in the Silver Mask? Right here! Get him! Careful! Dynamite Danger: Gunpowder This is Santo, the Man in the Silver Mask Yes Santo, I hear you, but first tell me what the horrible noise just now was, it was like the whole building was going to come crashing down It was the terrorist base, I have no time to go into detail Listen well, go with two armed and trusted men to cell BZ-12 Remove prisoner Dario and keep him out of contact until you recieve further orders and do not use that cell again Don't worry about that explosion, no human lives were lost. Over and out Someone must be crazy, an explosion that nearly destroys the building and doesn't kill anyone and a prisoner that has to removed from one cell and put in another. It's too much! There it is Forgive the wait After your matches in San Juan where will you be going Santo? To New York, where I'll give all my fans a warm greeting Greetings from Santo and Carlitos Colon Attention ladies and gentlemen, a match of two out of three falls with no time limit In this corner are the challengers, the Sensational Duo, the Red Rebel and Paradox against the team formed by the current Puerto Rican champion, Carlitos Colon and the world champion, the Man in the Silver Mask, Santo! Forgive the interruption Santo, but we arrived in San Juan today and we didn't want to miss the opportunity to meet you and watch you wrestle Now I understand your fame Santo, you're the best wrestler I've seen in my life Thank you. By the way, I just saw Vanessa accompanied by a gentleman sitting in the first row It's her, right? I recognized her from the picture you gave me in Mexico Yes Santo, the man with her is her administrator Enrique Artigas, though we found it odd that she would be here Why? Because she's never come to a public event before Possibly Mr. Artigas encouraged her, at any rate, did you know that the terrorist's base has been destroyed? Yes, the Security Council told us but we wanted to hear it personally from you It's my pleasure to confirm it and by the way, I congratulate you. The bag containing a bomb you left on the boat exploded just on time. It's a shame Aquarius remains alive Listen Santo, is there any truth in those rumors going around saying that there were many robotic human remains found in the explosion's vicinity? They're true, I'd just prefer not to talk about it for the moment Now please excuse me, I have a lot of work to do. I hope you enjoy your stay in this beautiful city - Thank you Santo - So long I bet you won again That so called Adonis is a faker That's true, but he's a tough nut to crack What have you learned? I followed the trail of that piece of cloth you gave me I found the manufacturer as well as the tailor who made the suit, but the address he told me belonged to his client was just the yacht club's dock and no one knew him there I thought so And what's the word on Enrique Artigas? He's a mulimillionaire who is descended from the pirate Francis Drake, so it's said Supposedly he inherited his fortune from him He oversees Vanessa's affairs because of the friendship he had with her father but the truth is that he's madly in love with her Do you know where in San Juan they're staying? Of course, she rented a place in San Tursi and he's staying at Condado Lagoon Hotel I'd like to pay that girl a visit I was just about to suggest that Look, that's where she's staying While you speak to Vanessa I'll look for a public telephone to call the inspector and see if anything new has happened Alright, but don't be long Alright - Who is it? - Santo, may I come in? Good evening Miss, I beg you to forgive me for coming at this late an hour but I needed to talk to you Come in, how can I help you? Make yourself at home The members of the board have informed me of the progress you've made in your struggle against the Aquarius' terrorists I've been lucky until now, but Aquarius is very clever, it's a very difficult battle Very lovely. At one point I was fascinated by painting, did you know? Very interesting I would paint white flowers, like these Really? Those are my favorite kind May I know who the painter is? This is the end for you Santo, all this has been programmed I understand, guess it was my time to lose, but before dying I'd like to know something I don't know if you're also programmed to answer I am Is the real Vanessa dead? No, Aquarius is in love with her, he has her along with her father Then Aquarius is Enrique Artigas? He is our supreme creator Come in Careful! There he is, attack him! Attack! Destroy them! You wretch! What happened Santo, Artigas just ran that way Yes, he's Aquarius, there's no time to lose Go to the cabaret, I'll catch up with you later - Did you see his car? - Yes Santo Let's go! Santo, how did you discover it? It was a hunch, I suspected her and asked a trick question about the painting I don't understand It's very simple: electronic sight cannot differentiate between red and white I was certain once I found the metallic plate behind her ear That's very clever Thank you. Sadly the mastermind behind all this has slipped through our hands You'll see we'll find him soon No, he's got a large headstart. We'd just be wasting our time uselessly We'll be hearing from him soon I like the other dress better But this one's very pretty Did he get away? Yes Martha, we lost precious time Look Octavio, this is Martha, my other agent - Enchanted - Her? I would have never suspected I've come to see you many times, you're a great entertainer Thank you very much. I have a big surprise for you Santo, Dario just left Impossible, he's in solitary confinement in prison, that was the order I gave the warden Yes, but somehow he managed to get out and he came to see me again Is he in there? I'm heading in there right now to- No, wait! He left a while ago. He invited me to his yacht He said that when his boss arrived he'd get a fortune and we'd travel the world together Did he say where his yacht was? Yes, here, at the yacht club Stay here with her Octavio Take care of yourself Martha, you're far too lovely to be in danger A masked man has gotten in my way and is about to stop me if you don't help me My help? When will you realize I hate you with all my heart? And if I told you that in exchange for your fortune I'd return your father? Are you crazy? My father disappeared on the high seas, you saw it yourself Listen Vanessa Who are you? Calm down, I'm a friend. I'm Santo, the Man in the Silver Mask, and you? Jose Robles. And Vanessa, my daughter? Where is she? There's no time to waste Mr. Robles, follow me I would have never thought you were capable of such evil That shows you what a man is willing to do for love of a woman You lie, you lie you cad! You want to force me with your lies, my father is dead! No Miss, that man speaks the truth, your father lives Father! Daughter! Careful Santo! Attack him, kill him! - Let me go, leave me alone! - Go on, walk! There she goes, Artigas took her! Stay here and help her father and tell the Inspector to come, I'll go after him I'm sorry I had to hit you Vanessa, but it was the only way to convince you Don't be silly Vanessa, these waters are infested with sharks By now your friend the wrestler must be shark food That's the boat, but he's far ahead Yes, we have to try to at least not lose sight of them Look, he's heading to the coast, surely he's going to disembark near old San Juan I told you, they're going to disembark If they manage to get to the city we won't see them again, tonight is the night of San Juan Is that something special? It's the happiest night of the year, everyone takes to the streets and beaches to celebrate it Naturally it's impossible to take a single step He went back. Prepare yourself, we're about to disembark Don't run! Don't run, come back! Wait! Turn off the motor, you're going have an accident! Come back! Imbecile! Don't you know that Aquarius is invincible? You're an electronics genius and yet you forget that a revolver can only carry six bullets Bastard! Let me go Santo! My arm, let me go! Let me go, I promise you anything, gold, money! Here you have the fierce and terrible Aquarius Vanessa, this is how cowards end up Here's the first payment for the fund dedicated to stopping hunger among children all over the world Thanks to all of you, in truth it was a group effort We'll be eternally grateful Santo Goodbye Martha, I swear I won't forget the night of San Juan We'll see each other again Did you already forget your debt? Debt paid The End
