Sound Effects. My family is always on the lookout for a great new movie that we can watch together as a family on movie night. You know, something fun, something exciting. Something that builds our faith in God and our strength as a family. Well, instead of waiting for another great new movie, we decided to make one. You're about to see it. It's called "Mercy Rule" and it's about a family who learns the Kingdom lessons of patience, courage, sacrifice, mercy, legacy and trusting God. So get your popcorn out, get your home movie theater all dialed in. Kids, grab the remote, turn the volume up, this is going to be lots and lots of fun. Here it is, "Mercy Rule." [Instrumental music] [Instrumental music] This is a scrap yard. [Instrumental music] Recycling begins here when you bring in that old milk carton or broken toaster. [Instrumental music] Everything you use every day, cans, bottles, cardboard, wire, steel, we'll crush it, bale it and load it on to trucks and trains and send it all over the world. My grandpa started it, we call him, Pops. My dad and my uncle run it. We're scrappers, it's what we do. We've been running this yard for 50 years. We can shred, crush, bale just about anything. And that's my dad, John Miller. Most people think it's just trash. Let me guess, you think it's treasure, right? No, not the creepy tall guy in the suit. It's a little cliché, but quaint, I guess. My dad hasn't worn a suit since Pops' funeral. No, we don't think it's treasure. I was going to say, most people think it's just trash and there's nothing to do but bury it. My dad has been on this yard six days a week since he turned 18. Apply enough pressure, send it off to the fire mills and suddenly someone gets to sell you a new shiny hybrid. He's the hardest worker I know. It's a good angle. You know what I see? I see a lot of liability around here. Actually, since my father started this business, we've done more than a billion dollars in this place. Only been to court twice, won both times. Come on, let's get you inside. I can tell this heat is melting your suit. Ah, come on back. My brother Ben's going to join us. He runs the company with me. All right, is this a, is this a good place, right here? Perfect. Yeah, I'm ready for my close-up, Mr. Trufant. (Laughter) - Okay? - Good? We're ready, we're ready. First interview with John Miller, CEO of Dante's Scrapyard, Inc. How many accidents have there been in your junkyards in the past year, Mr. Miller? Junkyards? You mean scrap yards? Why? Would you be willing to release the medical records of your long-term employees? Absolutely not. Why would you even ask that? I thought you were interested in the scrap/recycling business. Oh, we are, in every aspect of it. And the long-term health of the people engaged in this work is relevant to all future discussions of the booming waste recycling industry. Ah, if you could just make one correction. Waste is that which has no further use. Excuse me? That which has no further use. That's the definition. At Dante, I don't buy waste. We buy things with worth. At least they do, once they go through our machines. How much of your operating budget comes from subsidies? That's state, local, federal. Uh, zero, zip, zippidy, nada, phftt. We make our own way, like God and George Washington intended, sir. (Slurping) Mmhmm, right. How did your father die? I'm sorry, gentlemen, but I am going to have to get going. My brother Ben here will see you out. Well Mr. Miller, just one more question. Best of luck with your project. [Instrumental music] Uncle Ben, he's a little crazy, but you have to be a little crazy to do what we do, working this hard just to make old stuff worth something again. A little crazy and a lot tough. And that's my Pops up on the wall, young, strong, not the way I remember him. My sister says he was recycled from bark, old leather and Walt Disney. And his voice sounded like Uncle Ben's truck chewing on cigarettes. So uh, you want to watch me go bale some cans or bottles? Because that's what we do here... recycle. Wheeee... I think we're good. Let's cut that. Cody Miller has been doing battle tonight, folks. Yep, that's me and that's my sister, the one making fun of me. Pittsburgh is gambling here, betting that his arm still has juice. But it won't matter if he can just get the batter. I don't really mind, but only because she's good at it. The pitch... Crack! Cody Miller gets taken for a ride, upper deck, right there, three-run homer. Game over. [Instrumental music] No way. You know, Bob, Cody's curveball hangs when he's tired. Just sits out there like a cupcake. Seriously, a cupcake? How is a hanging curveball like a cupcake? Like a cupcake piñata. And every fan in this place just caught some candy. [Instrumental music] It didn't hang and it wasn't even a curveball. It didn't curve, it didn't slide, it wasn't fast. Grandma could have hit that. [Instrumental music] You need to work on your insults because Grandma's dead. I know, but she still could have hit that pitch. [Instrumental music] - Hey, guys! - Hey, Dad! How's it going? Come here, give me a hug. Are you excited about your game? I'll be more excited if Coach lets me pitch. But only if he pitches really well and gets recruited by the Pirates and wins a million dollars in free hats. (John chuckles) Drafted not recruited. Nice! (sighs) You know what, I'll show you a good arm. Uh, oh, oh, oh! Watch out, incoming! Grapefruit ball! [background conversations] Watch out, watch out, you got a good arm. [Instrumental music] Ooohh! [Instrumental music] All right, settle down! My tree. Guys, you have the whole yard, you mess with that tree. I eat those! Code, toss the mitt. Come on, wash up. All right, go inside, guys. Oh, and that's my mom. My dad said Mom's the reason Pops held on so long at the end. And when she finally said goodbye, it was like he had her permission to go. He was gone in an hour. [Instrumental music] This is my family and I know I'm lucky, but hey, it isn't all grapefruit fights and laughing at the table. I mean, well, just wait and see. Do you ever feel like we're cheating? What did we do to deserve perfect? Mmm. Why do we get to be happy when so many people aren't? You know what would make this night even more perfect? A cigarette. Jonathan Miller! If they didn't stink. If they didn't kill you. (John chuckles) I'll see you later, Captain Killjoy. Love you. [Instrumental music] And your breath better be fresh. [Instrumental music] [deep sigh] [Instrumental music] [Instrumental music] [thuds] [thuds] [Instrumental music] [distant thuds] What, you've never been nervous? [thuds] [rock music] [rock music] [rock music] [rock music] [crowd cheering] [rock music] Cody Miller in the hole! Coach, Coach! Will I get to pitch too? Get out there and hit the ball, Miller. [cheering] [rock music] Come on, Cody! [cheering] [rock music] [rock music] Whoo! [cheering] [cheering] Way to go, Code! [cheering] [rock music] [rock music] At least you hit the ball. At least you played first the whole game, I just stood in right field for two innings. And hit the ball and scored a run. You even got to slide. Next game, I wish I could get beamed just so I could stand on first base. - I want to pitch. - Yeah, everybody knows that. Hey Coach, by the way, can I pitch today? Nope. Coach, can I pitch today? What do you think? - Yes. - Nope. What's the opposite of yes? - Uh, yes? - No! - Can I pitch today? - No pitching. You know, the game's pretty loud, you know. I don't know, maybe you didn't understand. Nope. - You're sure? - No pitching. Oh, just a quick question, Coach: can I pitch today? Nope. Did I ask you this question yesterday? About pitching? Nope. - Cody, Cody? - Yeah? Quick question for ya, want to pitch? Because the answer is no. - You're absolutely... - I say no pitching! - Alright, got it. - No pitching. [Instrumental music] [cheering] There you go, buddy. [cheering] [Instrumental music] [Instrumental music] [Instrumental music] Thattaboy, Hank! [Instrumental music] Good hustle, buddy. Come on, right knee, right knee, that's it! [Instrumental music] Strike three, you're out! Dig, dig, dig, dig! Aw, good try. [kids shouting] Get there. Come on, strike on out! [Instrumental music] [cheering] Oooh! Ah, hit man, take your base. [cheering] [Instrumental music] Right field. That's where you play if you're scared of the ball because you're never going to touch it. Right field is torture for a real player. My mom has a better view in the stands than I do in right field! Pitcher, catcher, first base, they're in on everything, but I'm just stuck watching my teammates screw up and lose a game that I'm barely even a part of. [Instrumental music] You need to get back, cover home! You need to get back! Cover home! [cheering] [Instrumental music] You've got to be there! [cheering] Let's go, let's get a hit! Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice. All right Cody, take a seat. Jay? Jay, you're in and you're up. Just get on deck. What? But Coach, I didn't do anything wrong! I said take a seat. [Instrumental music] [crowd cheering] Ben, I don't even know what you're talking about. Ben, I'm trying to watch a game here with my family, all right. We do not need an investigator and we don't need lawyers. No, lawyers! All right, fine, if you want to get one, you're gonna hire them yourself and you're paying for it, not me and not the company. Come on, Jake, cut one loose, son! Can I pitch today? Listen, I'm, I'm hanging up now. Okay, hello? See you tomorrow, bye. Jay Barfield in to hit, replacing Cody Miller in the lineup. Mom, Cody's out, he's not hitting. Do you think he's okay? Here we go, Jay! Here we go! That's my boy! That's my boy! Even your walk scares 'em. Keep your shoulders back! I don't know. You think he's hurt? Hmm? Cody's out, do you think he's hurt? No, no I think he got ticked off and threw his glove in the outfield. Oh! You don't want that one, you don't want that one, it's junk! I hope he strikes out. Hey, that's not very nice. Oooh! [cheering] Whoo! I wish I could hit like that. Come on, Cody. [cheering] Hit every base! Get every base! Touch every base! [cheering] Whoo! Good job, Jay! Jay Barfield with a deep, deep homer. I think we can expect to see a lot of him this season. Darn. So, at least we're in first place. I'm never gonna make all-stars. I can't even play for my own team. You know, I want to pitch too, but you don't see me complaining. Whatever. Cody. [honking] Just stay here, I'll be right back. - John. - Hey. Hey, I told you we'd talk tomorrow. No, this is bad, John, really bad. This is straight up government cash grab. Ken, what are you talking about? The definition of hazardous waste being expanded. Scrappers and recyclers having to be EPO trained and permitted, all the way down to crazy Stan with his weekly bag of cans. I'm talking about $100,000 per year minimum. We can't afford that, John, not even close. First they crush us with fees and permits we can't afford and then they offer door number two, handing over majority ownership. Yeah, look. This guy... Where is it? Right here, Evan Trufant. - Yeah. - Yeah. Yeah, that's the guy we just did the thing with, recycling. No, no, this isn't some grad student journalist, all right? He's an eco-lobbyist... for hire. And he currently holds contracts with ten cities in California. I've been on the phone, John. Cities need the cash. They want our operations. Ben, I'll make some calls. Okay, but you need to stop wigging out. You need to turn off the talk radio and cool your brain down. Okay, I'd invite you over here to have a cone with us, but you're going to freak Maggie out. Now would you relax? I know lots of guys in the city and if you are right, which I doubt you are, they'll know. This is ridiculous. This is unfair and they'll know that too. All right? Okay? Well, the only good thing is we didn't take that subsidiary bait. Okay? So far, every scrapper hit applied for that stuff first. Oh, get the... king is... gosh diggity, piece of... cheese slave... Settle down, come have a cone. A cone? Yeah, come have a snow cone. It'll make you feel better and we'll talk tomorrow. Yeah, that'll make it all better, a cone. Relax! A cone, that's what I want, a cone. Bring me a cone, my life is falling apart. [Instrumental music] [yelling at someone] Everything! You get him to call me. I don't care where he is, you tell him to call me! [Instrumental music] Not... [Instrumental music] Hey, I'm sorry about that. I was having a little trouble with one of the... Where's Code? Fair! [Instrumental music] John, you should go talk to him. [Instrumental music] [cell phone ringing] Hey. Hey, thanks for calling me back. Listen, it's about that hazardous waste subsidiary application the city sent us a while back. [Instrumental music] Yeah, did we send that in yet? You did? Okay, is there any way we can get that back? Can we rescind it? I knew something was wrong and I knew it was bad. I didn't know the government was trying to take our business. I didn't even know they could do that. Well, how long have you known? I got conned, didn't I? Argh! I know I described it as hazardous waste. You told me to. I was applying for their stupid program. But even if I had known, I wouldn't have cared. No. [Instrumental music] Aw, no! [Instrumental music] [sighs] Ben's gonna kill me. [Instrumental music] Hey, Cody? [Instrumental music] Cody? [Instrumental music] [Instrumental music] [Instrumental music] [Instrumental music] [Instrumental music] [Instrumental music] Hey, Pops. [Instrumental music] Before he died, Pops had more things to say than he had time, things he wanted to make sure I knew before he was gone. [Instrumental music] He'd call me over to his recliner and smile and pull off his oxygen mask. [Instrumental music] I noticed his scarred knuckles and those spots on his hands that carried a machine gun in WWII, and sorted a million tons of steel in a lifetime of scrapping. I heard it all but I really didn't think about it until he was gone. Every word was a fight for him, but he got them out eventually. He said things like, "First in, last out, laugh loudest." [Instrumental music] "Cody, anybody ever mess with your sister, you make like a stung rodeo bull." "Truth is hard, but every lie is a slap to the face." "Winning's not as important as fighting on the right side." And, "You got a problem with someone", doesn't matter who they are, "you man up and go eye-to-eye." [sighs] Let's do this. [knocking] Can I help you? Ughhh. You're on Dad's team, right? I was at your last game. You've got a great arm. I, um, uh, thanks. I'd like to pitch. Yeah, I've heard. So, you're here to see my dad? Ahem. About pitching? I thought so. Well, come on in, I'll get him. [loud music] [music shuts off] Can you even hear yourself think? When you can't hear yourself think, think louder. Right, Co'? Come in. I wasn't expecting you, buddy. I was expecting your father. You see, when kids don't get what they want, the parents show up with every kind of patty cake. Cake pops mostly. Some flowers, some poor folks might try cookies, some go for threats. Oh, oh yeah. 50 bucks at the Olive Garden and you're back on the field. You got 50 bucks, Cody Miller? I, I don't understand, you want me to pay you? Well, isn't that how you want me to run my team? Whichever kids ask the most and the loudest and the nicest gets to play? Or maybe, now I don't know, but maybe I just put the best boys on that grass and on that dirt. You know, the boys that are going to help the team win? How does that sound? Rich boys, poor boys, tall boys, short boys, Latin boys, black boys, white boys. Better idea, maybe I just watch you swing the stick and field the ball and I let that decide. Maybe I don't care who drops by the house and has their mom callin' and sticks coffee cards in my mailbox. Dad. I know, it's just these parents nowadays are freaking me out. It's okay, it's okay. Hey, breathe, breathe. One, two, three, in and out. You got this. Okay, now find it. Ready? [beat boxes] There it is, see, you got this. Aw, isn't she the best? I love this girl, I love it! Nothing like her mother, absolutely nothing. But that's a different story. I was at fault too. I'm sorry, Cody, it's just that I burnt dinner and already had three phone calls from parents about the next game. (Laughs) Yeah. At least you showed up. I can respect that. Come on, let's sit down. I'll be better once I'm off my feet. [guzzling] Ah, cold root beer, what an adventure. I shouldn't have thrown my glove in the outfield when Stevie didn't cover home. No, you shouldn't have thrown the ball. What? Why not? The runner was rounding third. I knew I could get it there. Yeah, you knew you could get it there, but you also knew Stevie wasn't there. [Instrumental music] Yeah, but... A good player is like a good brother... he gets your back when you screw up. He's out there making everyone around him better. Saving butts, covering for mistakes, coming through when every other kid in a matching lid is depending on him. You saw Stevie was out of position and you still threw that ball. You made everyone in that park notice that Stevie was being an idiot. You drew attention to it. You made things worse just to make your point. Think about it, the runner advanced off that throw. You put your team and your pitcher in a bigger hole and you made your catcher look like a moron. So no, you're right, you shouldn't have thrown your glove. [Instrumental music] But first, you shouldn't have thrown the ball. I wasn't trying to make Stevie look stupid. In baseball, we back each other up on the field, always. Now every boy will fail or succeed all by himself, but with everyone watching. The fear of striking out, of leaving runners on base, of being the weak link in the lineup, it even beats the big leaguers now. Teammates work against them, they pick each other up. [Instrumental music] Why are you here, Cody Miller? What was it you wanted to say to me? I just wanted to find out why you weren't letting me play. I just wanted to find out why you weren't letting me pitch. I'll put you back on the field when I think the whole team will be better for it. When boneheads like Stevie will feel safer with you out there. As for pitching, you're strong but you don't have great control. If there are better guys I can put on that mound, I will. And you should always want the best guy out there, even if it isn't you. [doorbell] And that will be my Chinese food. Ana? So, if I'm the best, you'll play me? No, if you're the best for the team, I'll play you. Got it? I'll get the plates. [instrumental music] [instrumental music] [instrumental music] Where have you been? I almost called the cops. I'm sorry, I went and talked to coach. Is dad mad? Ugh, I'm not even sure he knows. You both missed dinner. Yours is in there wrapped up, cold, but you earned it that way. He went outside to talk to you and he went back to work. Is he back yet? No. Is everything okay? You let me worry about your dad, okay? I want to hear from you. So what did you say to your coach? Well, I just wanted to know why he pulled me. I don't think he's going to be playing me anytime soon. I know he won't let me pitch. Cody, Coach isn't stupid. He says I need to be a better teammate. Buddy, let's go get something to eat, okay? Your dad's gonna want to talk to you when he gets home. All right? Hey, and no taking off. - Don't do that to me, okay? - Got it. All right. Come on. [instrumental music] [instrumental music] [instrumental music] [door closes] [instrumental music] [cheering] [instrumental music] [cheering] Way to go, Jay! The Pie, the Pirates, the Pirates are doing it again. Whoo, that's too Broadway. I don't do Broadway. Not well. Gentlemen, I appreciate the call, John, but we could have done this somewhere else. No, no, here's good, but no cameras. [cheering] No camera, no me. If you want to talk, we talk on the record... or posterity. Right and that's why you're here. You want to talk to me, you come to my yard, safest place in town. [cheering] Let's do this, huh? Let's go, big hitter, come on. It's strange, isn't it? Junkyards used to be graveyards where old appliances and cars were stripped and cannibalized. They were the ugly industrial underbelly of every city, tended by immigrants, gypsies, snarling dogs, the stuff of nightmares for any neighborhood kid near one. But now, now they're the city darlings. Co-opting the positive P.R. of sustainability and carbon reduction and zero waste pioneers. Let's do it, way to go. You're an odd man. Everything comes around in the end.... Come on, let's do this. [cheering] So, I know who you are, I know what you're doing and it's not going to work. Enlighten me. First step, turn the cameras off. John, I'm afraid I just can't do that. Look, we've covered this. Yeah, but I think you might want to reconsider. Why, are you mobbed up or something? Do you intend to have large Italian gentlemen with toothpicks come visit me at my home? You lied to me. You're not a journalist, you're a lobbyist. You're the, you're an expert consultant lawyer, jack of all money-grabbing trades. You're bureaucratic muscle for hire. You know, everybody hates corporate raiders, but you're worse, you're a civic raider. You're a thief with the law behind them. You're a snake from the tip of your tailbone to that fork in your tongue. You've been contracted by the Mayor's office to go after scrappers and you're taking public funds to do it. Which means, all your footage will be copied and handed over to me as soon as my Freedom of Information request is processed that was filed this morning. Good luck with that. I spent a few hours on the phone last night talking to some of your victims, so it's not real hard for me to understand what comes next. You're sure you still want that camera on? [instrumental music] Cover, cover, cover! Safe! [instrumental music] Guard him! First create a fictitious program, offer truckloads of subsidy money for scrappers. Only you word the application in such a way that any scrapper who tries to fill it out appears to be agreeing that he's working with hazardous waste. Hold on, no, wrong. They don't appear to be agreeing, they are agreeing. Right. You see, at the top of the page you'll notice "hazardous waste" is right across the top in big black letters. I, here we go, "Which type of hazardous waste" does your operation handle?" I like the way you worded that. "Circle all that apply." A-cans and light aluminum; B-bottles and plastics, C-Scrap iron, of all types and D-paper and cardboard. Warm up. Pitching? Really? Seriously, come on, dude? Paper, cans, cardboard? But you circled all of them. You see you took your little pencil, you circled all of them. Don't you see, don't you get it? "Your Honor, John Miller, CEO of Dante Scrapyards, Inc." Was happy to have cans labeled as hazardous when it meant that other people's money was going to be handed to him. But now that the term might affect a little bit of his control, "well... surprise he suddenly objects." So, I'm an idiot. Welcome to the party. I don't know if I'd call you an idiot, maybe, maybe not. But a hypocrite. Well that's a matter of public record now. Quinn, go catcher. [instrumental music] Phase two: you test soil samples of the scrap yards and you do it under the guise of this new subsidy program and then you send those samples off to your own friendly labs. Phase three: you present to the city a new proposal for guidelines governing the handling of so-called hazardous wastes. Phase four: You propose that the definition of hazardous waste is expanded and of course you're the expert consultant in that field. And so you advise the city on acceptable soil pollution levels, coincidentally setting them just below what you've already found in the scrap yard soils. Final phase: The city crushes scrappers under massive permit fees and expensive certification requirements and EPO training fees all because now paper and cans and cardboard are considered hazardous. A 60-year-old family business started by immigrants just disappears. You're not testing my soil. I got friends at sanitation that have promised to scratch and claw and bite if the definition of hazardous waste comes up at all. So move along, you're in the wrong town. Remind me to play poker with you. Mom, no look, over there. Cody's warming up. Okay, um, up by two. No outs. Runners on second. - And third. - Yeah. Oh. It might be best if this portion of our conversation lacked any digital record. [instrumental music] Nobody dead there. Nobody dead. [instrumental music] Come on, let's do this here! Bring it, guys, come on! One runner. One, one, one, one, one, one run! Safe! [cheering] - Time, Lou! - Time! Here we go. Listen to me, Evan Trufant. [instrumental music] When I was a kid I watched my dad face down mob goons who wanted a piece of this operation. I saw my mom throw blankets over Molotov's on the front porch, while my dad worked the shotgun. You think I'm going to wilt for some hand sanitizing eco-eel? I still got that shotgun. [cheering] Well then, your cards appear to be a refusal to let me test your soil, a few friends who drive garbage trucks and an antique shotgun. That's a pretty thin hand, especially considering the size of the pot. I mean, we are talking about your livelihood here and the multi-million dollar business that your father and your uncle started from nothing. And not to mention the future of your children. I mean, how are they going to afford going to junkyard school? [instrumental music] [instrumental music] [instrumental music] Foul ball! [instrumental music] Now, for my cards. I already tested your soil. The mercury concentrations were distressing to the Mayor and the several City Councilmen with whom I discussed them this morning. We had a few bagels, croissants. I don't know if I'd call them friends yet, but we're getting there, we're working on it. This is a letter from the City, very official looking you'll notice the seal, where it explains their new permitting process for the handling of hazardous waste. Uh, I wouldn't even suggest looking at number three, it's brutal, ooh. [instrumental music] [instrumental music] Strike! 0 and 2. [instrumental music] This, these are minutes from the City Council meeting held two months ago, you remember. Oh no, you don't, you weren't there. I was there and I remember that they expanded the definition of hazardous waste material to qualify for Federal Subsidies. This may bring back a pleasant memory, this is a form you filled out applying for that hazardous waste subsidy after the definition had been expanded, thereby implicitly agreeing to that expansion. [instrumental music] [cheering] And this, this is fun. This, ha, you're going to need a bigger desk. You've now been served. Wrongful death suit. That's rough, huh? Yeah, you can expect the anger and the picketing to start, oh, next week, when these horrible tragedies are made public. [instrumental music] [cheering] Let's see your mama throw blankets on these Molotov's. [ping of bat striking ball] [instrumental music] This is ridiculous. We just crush, we bale, we ship. [instrumental music] We don't burn, we don't melt, we don't process. It doesn't matter, you're done. [instrumental music] Check... mate, rape and pillage. [instrumental music] [instrumental music] Get out. Just get out. Uh, oh, oh. You see, I'm not done. [instrumental music] Jeff, get us out of this mess. [instrumental music] You get two warm-up pitches, yellow. Let's go! [instrumental music] You want 51 percent ownership of my company? You're beaten, John and you know it. You fight me on this and I won't stop raining hell down on you until six months after your brother is suing you, your wife has left you and you're selling spare organs for cigarette money. Cutting me in as a majority owner is the only way you get to keep anything. I'm offering to end the game early, John, mercy rule. Whoa, oh, oh, wait... roll this, roll this. We can always add an assault charge to the list, John. You have one week. Try everything, flail around, get through all the phases of grief as quickly as possible. But we can all be winners here. But some win just a little bit more than others, don't they? Mercy rule, John. [instrumental music] [instrumental music] You know when I was a kid we called it slaughter rule, this seems more appropriate somehow. Yeah. Oh, don't grow a conscious on me now. Before we're done you're gonna see a lot worse than that. [loud bang] Jeff Johnson gets a strikeout with just three pitches and another one, Jeff Johnson gets them swinging! Honey, you did good. Jeff's fastball is unreal. He's probably throwing like 70. It's true. Did you know he could throw like that, Cody? Three up and three down. Jeff Johnson gets his third strikeout in as many batters and leaves the winning run stranded on third. - Ice cream, Cody? - No. Honey, your whole team's going to be there. I thought it was a great game, you even got on base. Cody, Jeff's your friend, you should be happy for him. [instrumental music] [instrumental music] Listen Cody, I'm not saying that Jeff's better than you, that he's even... [instrumental music] [loud crash] Whoa. [instrumental music] It's not okay. [instrumental music] [machinery sounds] [instrumental music] [instrumental music] [instrumental music] [instrumental music] What's up, boss? [instrumental music] Scrap it. What?! I said, scrap it! [instrumental music] [instrumental music] You didn't actually want Jeff to fail though, right? Because I mean, that would make you like evil. You know like, the bad guy in movies. I think I should just quit. Quitter? The most important position in every team. Cody Miller has really excelled as the quitter, Bob. So much better than he was playing as the whiner. You have to happy for Jeff. You have to. [cell phone ringing] Hello? John, listen to me. And you should be grateful too. Wherever you are right now, you have 40 minutes to meet me at Rubio's. You'd be feeling a lot worse right now if it was you who actually lost the whole game. Forty minutes! Or I turn all your t-shirts pink and I shrink them in the dryer! You only lost the lead, Jeff had your back. Tonight, you are listening to me. And after you listen to me, you're going to do some talking, okay? Your brother's bringing pizza for the kids. I stink. You always have. I'll be there in 30 minutes. I love you, John. [instrumental music] Coach is never gonna play me again. [honking] Uncle Ben is here. [instrumental music] - Uncle Ben! - Hi, Uncle Ben. [laughter] I come bearing happiness with extra cheese. What's up, man? Who's your uncle? Nobody even knew Jeff could pitch like that or even that he wanted to. Speed, control and crazy calm. Jeff Johnson? The freckled kid? Yeah, I knew. I just didn't really care. Mmm, you didn't talk to him after? No uh, "Good game." or "Nice arm." or "Thanks for saving my personal bacon?" Mmm. You know where he lives? Well, yeah, he's my best friend. "He's my best friend." You're not acting like it. All right, that's it. Let's go, to the truck. Let me just get my shoes. No, no, you don't deserve shoes. Let's go, just get in the car. Can I get an appetizer while you wait? Maybe a mixed a drink? No thanks, my date just rolled in. How about for you, sir, any drink? Something dark and bitter. Because the world has gone unstable. Well that's what I said. Sir, there's no smoking in here. What? I'm not smoking. Oh. Protests will become contagious, they would cascade. They would sweep the middle east. I wasn't going to smoke it. Well, of course not. It's just a cool look behind your ear. [instrumental music] I want that. I want your hand... and then your eyes. And... this is the moment of truth, Bob. [knocking] Cody Miller at the plate. - Hey, can I talk to you? - Yeah. John, you're battling something and you need to tell me what it is. It's not optional. Right now I have something more important for you to think about. - I doubt it. - Cody. I need you to talk to his coach. I'm all for tough love, right, but this has gone too far. Okay, and it's against the rules. Look, let me show you this. You sure you don't want to come in? Nah, I'm good. I just wanted to say nice job today. Good game. So you want me to get Cody's coach suspended? No. I just want you to talk to him. Okay, he's the best player out there and he's getting humiliated. My dad's been working me a ton. He talked to the coach, I knew I was going to get my chance sometime. He pitched today, John. I so wish you could have been there. He faced one batter who drove in the tying runs and he got pulled. Maddie. And Jeff Mitchell goes in, three straight strikeouts. You're really good. Thanks, but you're way better. You saved my sorry Miller and bacon... Sorry Miller, I'm... I'm bacon. Something Pops used to say to us all the time. "I gotta tell you, sorry Miller, I'm bacon." I like it. I know I should be happy for Jeff, he is such a nice kid, but the whole time I'm just sitting there and I'm feeling so sick in my stomach for Cody. Maddie. He's so good at the plate, he's so good in the field, it just doesn't make sense. I feel like the coach hates him or something and we don't even know why. Maddie, I ruined everything. - By "everything" you mean? - I mean, everything. Hey guys, are we ready to take a look at some menus? Uh, no thank you. Of course, you are. Here's one for you and one for you. All right, today's specials. Today we have a hand caught grilled salmon on a bed of... Go away. What's her name? What? What's her name? No, Maddie, stop it. No. So not everything? I almost lost that game. Hey Cody, you sure you don't want to come in? Nah, I'm good. Uncle Ben's going to be taking me back, so... Well, say, "Hi" to your parents for me. Got it. - Bye Jeff. - Bye. And Cody Miller rounds the bases, his eye on bacon intact and untanned. Uh, you'll get the hang of it. You're talking about losing money, John, "money" not health. Not children, not love, not me. Not my pride in you. I'm talking about losing everything my father built. No, you are what your father built, you. A husband and a father that you are. Bea and Cody are your father's legacy, not someplace where you smash metal. John... John, your father came here with nothing. No family, no parents, no money. And if we have to start over, which I doubt we will, we're not starting from zero. We'll have you and you'll have us and we will have all the toughness and all the faith and all the... What did your dad call that? Cussidness. And all the cussidness that he taught us. - And Ben. - And Ben. [laughter] Crush us up and send us to the mill, all you're getting back is new steel. Maddie, I wish there was some way I... there were better words for me to tell you how much I love you. You're like rain after days of heat. A flood. And that first smell of a big parking lot. A-plus for trying... [laughter] Keep working with your hands, huh? No, you could be a hand model. Hey, you want to get out of here? Have dinner with the kids? Come on. Hey guys, I brought you your drink, it's not necessary dark or bitter, but it's delicious. - Uh no, we've got to go. - Oh. You've got something in your hair. There we go, got it. Okay, well you guys have a great night and we hope to see you soon. All right. That's a much better place for it. I'm a big tipper. Hey, that's our pizza! Hey guys, how's it going? [laughter] Ben, how much sugar did you give them? They're not my kids, so I really don't care. [laughter] I don't know, we took care of some business, right? Yeah, he took me to see Jeff. Hey dad, I got to pitch today. - Yeah? - Yeah, I stunk. Yeah, stunk like a skunk. Hey Cody, I'm so sorry I couldn't see your game today, buddy. Mom told me you threw hard, though? And she asked me to talk to your coach about you getting some more playtime, so I was just about to call him. No, no, no, no don't, please. It would make everything worse. I already talked to him. Really, you already talked to your coach? I know what I need to do. Well, sort of. At least just give me a try. Just please don't talk to him. Let's go inside and have some sundaes. Come on. Yeah, that sounds great. Love it. I haven't had some in a long time. Hey, hey man. Um, so what's the news, bro? I mean, you told me not to worry and I haven't, so. Yeah. Um, well... - Want one? - Thank you. You're welcome. Whoa. Settle down, Bea. Get some off of the top. Off of this? Okay guys, I'll cut some bananas, okay? This doesn't even make sense. Why do you want...? Uh, you know with the... Yeah? Trying to take down all the scrappers and the recyclers up and down the city. - Right. - And the State. Are you okay, Mom? Yeah. Here. Thanks. What do you want me to use this for? I filled out the application and I sent it in. You told me not to do it and I did it. [voices outside] to deal with and you're right. - You sent it in? - I sent it in. You gave in? You didn't listen to what I had to say. [voices outside] This is Bea's, obviously. - Oh! - You're right, I'm sorry. I made a mistake. Yeah, you did make a mistake, the biggest mistake! [voices outside] I didn't think this was going to be a problem. Yes, you should have listened to me! It's good. What! Oh! You've got to be kidding me. I know. I told you exactly, this is what's going to happen and that's what happened! Calm down, I don't want Maddie coming out here and you're going to freak her out. Now, let's just... I don't, you know what, she should be freaked out because she's married to a freak. [voices outside] [sighs] I definitely want some more cream on mine, Mom. Got to talk to Maddie about this whole thing and I got to explain to her what happened. Okay, all right, here we go. I need you more than ever. I need you to stand with me and I need you to help me figure this out. You know more about this than I do.

Do we have any forks or any spoons? Here we go, they're right down here. [instrumental music] Mom is on her way. Bea, I want you to glue yourself in one spot on those bleachers until she gets there. And make sure Cody can see you. Okay Cody, I want you to kill it, baby! Come on, whatever position you get, you kill it! Got it. I'll be the best benchie I can be. Not what I meant. All right, go get them! Big game today, Cody Miller. How do you feel? Sick. Sick like a champion or sick like a dog? You can throw up in your hat if you need to. Hey Babe, it's me, just dropped off the kids, I'm heading to City Hall, Ben's going to meet me there. Yeah, there's got to be someone there who can clear this whole thing up. Yeah, no problem, I got this. Yeah, I'm not leaving until I find somebody. Okay, love you. Bye. Whew, let's do this. Hey Cody, still want to pitch? If you need me to, but Jeff is better.

You just swoop over a lake and "baaak," and just grab it with your feet? Ben, shut up. (Laughs) [scoffs] Dad would be shaking his head at us right now, you know? Like that time we tried to sell pinecones, remember that? "Just another 2-for-1 moron day." "And the first moron's free." (laughs) You know, the truth is he wasn't always such a genius himself. Remember when he tried to break into the ice cream truck business? (laughs) The devil truck! With the horns and the tail blowing propane fire from the grill? Now, now that was hazardous. Which reminds me of something. Dad gave you his old car. You know, he always said he was going to fix it, but I think we saw him drive it maybe once. I crushed it, Ben. [sighs] I shouldn't have, but I did. I was just tired of hanging on to dead stuff. I've been really stupid lately. I'm really going to regret doing that one. Actually I'm thrilled. The way I see it, you renounced claim to ownership. The car's now mine. (Laughs) What? Yeah, Raoul thought you'd regret it, so he held off. - You serious? - Uh huh. Then I showed up to take it out of your hands. - Oh come on. - Oh yeah, baby. Ooh, ooh, ooh. Councilwoman Ryan. If I could have just a minute. Uh, blisters. Call me Sadie. Councilwoman, Sadie, I would really appreciate it if the City Council would reconsider... Save it. I know what I think and you'd like it, but you need a majority of the Council to say no to some pretty free looking money just because you lost to someone that wasn't playing fair. And the Council cares about fair about as much as a one-girl prom committee. What do I do? They're not going to like it, but I can get you 15 minutes in the meeting tomorrow night, even if I have to hold hostages. How you spend you time is up to you. Wear shoes. Hey, that's something, right? Something. Nah, we're dead. We should look into selling ice cream. That's it for today, fellas. Ooop, and get all your cans and bottles for the drive into Dante's scrap by the end of next week, all right? And we'll cut those entry fees way down. I mean, we are going to the playoffs, aren't we? All: Yeah! Let's go, sweethearts! We're in second place, but by this time tomorrow, we could be in... All: First place! Who wants to be in first place, right? Heading into the playoffs? What? - Huh? - What? You know what? Forget everything I told you all season, all right? Get scared, fight with each other, skateboard, break your wrist! Give up early and often! (laughter) All right, come on, come on, bring it in! Bring it in! (Laughter) Come on, get it in there. On three. One, two, three! All: Pirates! [instrumental music] Dad, how'd it go? Hey. Oh, I hate wearing a suit. Hey, how'd your game go? Mom told me you played really hard. Yeah, but not great. Although I did have fun. Can you make it tomorrow? Tomorrow? Yeah, we're playing the number one team. Haven't even lost, haven't even come close. Jeff says he's pretty sure that they're cheating and playing 14 year olds though. I'm pretty sure they're not doing that. One pitcher has a mustache and a tattoo. Cody look, I'm gonna try my best, but buddy, I got so much stuff I just have to finish tomorrow. I'll do my best, okay? You know, if it'll make you feel any better, I can talk to your mom about taking you down there to get a tattoo in the morning. - Funny. - No, no, no, I'm serious. I'm thinking it could be kind of cool. You know, like a pretty little butterfly right here behind the ear... Ohh! Oh, you want to fight, huh? All right, buddy, come here, buddy.

Thanks, Dad. You know why Pops loved baseball? Everyone's on a team, but everyone faces the pitcher alone. Every player in that lineup walks to the plate like a champion of an army with the whole team heaped up in his shoulders betting on his bat. And then you do your best. You take your swings but the rest is out of your control. The pitch, the wind, the lumps in the grass and the dirt, the speed of the outfielders, the placement of the sun, the strength of some other boy's arm. That's all for Providence to sort out. Pops said this to me before every game. Remember this, Cody. Remember it for always, so you can say it to your son, even though he'll be fat and slow. (chuckling) What? Cody, you stand in there. You have eyes, so see. You have hands to hold that bat, so swing. You have legs, so use them like you just got them. And when you drop a piddler off the end of that bat, scamper like a greyhound and pray to the Lord God Almighty that some kid kicks a heel and eats dirt. Or, as I like to say, Cody, just rip liners into the gaps in the outfield. Yes, sir! All right, let's get to the park! I'm ready to warm some bleachers with my Miller-hind bacon. You're coming? Yeah, I'm coming. Yeah, I might have to leave in the middle or maybe the beginning or maybe the end. Ben's going to keep me posted. - Are you sure? - Yeah, I'm sure. Yeah, I'm as ready as I'm ever going to be. Swing batter, batter. Omaha Beach, June 6, 1944. Pops said some boys were so scared, they couldn't even move when the doors opened to let the soldiers pour out. The guns up on the cliffs, the shells, the hissing bullets too fast to see, they just froze and that's what killed them. He said he just wanted to shut his eyes and die, but he didn't. Two of his friends did, though. You ever been in a fight you shouldn't win? Faced a bully too big and too strong? Know what it feels like to just want to shut your eyes? [war sounds] I do... now. [instrumental music] [instrumental music] [instrumental music] [instrumental music] [instrumental music] All right, fellas, don't worry about this sorry convict on the mound. If you can see the ball, you can hit the ball. Get the bat off your shoulder, choke up if you have to. Don't try to kill it. Just put metal to leather. Mmm? We're the Pirates! Ha ha! We are the Pirates! We are the Pirates! The Pirate king is here! The Pirate king is here! We are the Pirates! Let's play ball! [cheering] [instrumental music] [instrumental music] [instrumental music] Get it! [instrumental music] Go, go, faster, go! [instrumental music] Come on, now! [instrumental music] That's it! [instrumental music] [instrumental music] [instrumental music] Be awake! [instrumental music] Come on! And, and uh, and in conclusion, summation, if you will, in reference to the city skate parks with wifi enabled, that we've yet to break ground on. I would like it to be duly noted as a matter of public opinion. [text chime] [cheering] I'm all done. I'm staying here. I'll get on the road in about 15 minutes. [instrumental music] Down by one, mmm, top of the 6th. Everybody bats! That's how we get out of this. Coach, rally caps? [spits] Rally caps, it is! Short hat! [crowd cheering] Guys, guys, guys, rally caps! Rally caps! [cheering] [instrumental music] Pop. [instrumental music] [bat crack] [footsteps] [cheering] [instrumental music] [cheering] [instrumental music] Safe! [cheering] Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate's life for me! [cheering] Strike three, you're out! [cheering] [instrumental music] Come on, Jeff. Come on, Jeff, bring me home. [instrumental music] [bat cracks] Come on, Code, you got this. [cheering] [pop] [instrumental music] [instrumental music] [talking quietly] [instrumental music] Wow! (Laughs) [shouting] [cheering] Okay. [cheering] We're okay. [cheering] Yeah, way to go! [cheering] [shouting] [instrumental music] Jeff, you're on the mound. Cody, take first for him. Bell, you trust Cody. Remember, three more outs... [instrumental music] No more runs... [instrumental music] And you guys are number one. [bat cracks] [instrumental music] Be awake, guys! [instrumental music] Safe! [instrumental music] No, no, no! (Shouting) [clapping] [instrumental music] [instrumental music] Way to go, guys. [instrumental music] [instrumental music] It's not over, Jeff, you got this. [bat cracks] [instrumental music] [instrumental music] [instrumental music] [instrumental music] [instrumental music] [instrumental music] [instrumental music] [instrumental music] [instrumental music] [instrumental music] [instrumental music] [instrumental music] [instrumental music] [instrumental music] [instrumental music] [instrumental music] [instrumental music] [instrumental music] [instrumental music] [instrumental music] [instrumental music] [instrumental music] Triple play. An honest to goodness triple play. [background conversations] That's what I'm talking about. Together everyone achieves more, the word team. Beautiful. Mad props to you, Cody. Guys, huh? How good was he? (Applause) All right, that's what I mean. All right, well I'll send out the playoff schedules when I get it and we'll take it from there. Hey, your kid's a top player. Now I can see where he gets it. Just keep fighting, man. Who's that? (text chime) Somebody I thought I hated. I want you to become baseball. Can you guys do that for me? Come on! And thanks, Mr. Miller please, for the can drive. Everybody clap your hands! [Rhythmic clapping] Ho ho! (Laughs) And remember I was talking about skateboarding, breaking your wrists, all that stuff? You know, do not do that, please. Hey Coach, Coach, excuse me. I know this is weird and everyone wants to get home, but if anyone's willing to follow me down to City Hall for just a 15 minute meeting, I'm willing to buy pizza for everyone. [cheering] And ice cream and soda. (louder cheering) All right, but it's got to be right now. Okay, saddle up, guys. Let's do it, come on! [instrumental music] [instrumental music] At this time, John Miller, CEO of Dante Scrapyards Inc., would like to address the Council. Mr. Miller? [instrumental music] Mr. Miller? Is my voice, my, my voice okay, here? Um, just an aside, just something I've been thinking about, a lot of cameras around this town. Going through red lights and stuff, is that really necessary? You know, just food for thought, I'm not blaming you. Is this America or Russia? Is this like a laminate? That's a beautiful floor. You went ahead and you just put the whole floor on the wall there too. That's like a racquetball court. And I want to know what we can do as a city to get back on the gold standard. Start local, wheew, unafraid. I'm not afraid. I have a gun. It is not a real, it's a musket, it's an old antique musket that my grandpa gave me. Yes, it's not very effective with people who break into the house, but you break in, I'm gonna clean that puppy out. I'm a, it's gonna rock and roll. You better be out by, in about five minutes or I'm gonna rain a pellet down on you. [door opens] Come on, everybody come in and sit here. Excuse us, this meeting's in session. Please find your seats quickly and quietly. Everybody put your stuff down. Everybody quickly. I'm so sorry. Apology, just give us a minute. Everybody sit down and take a seat. Everybody quickly just have a seat. Do your thing, okay? All right. Ahem. Good afternoon, Council members. Thank you very much for your time. I'm John Miller and I am here to talk with you today about hazardous waste and about these young, dangerous criminals that you now see before you in this room. I don't know whether you realize it but they have been breaking the law for years now. They have been handling hazardous waste without permits, without EPO regulations and without government oversight. Furthermore, they've been selling it to pay for baseball uniforms and league entry fees. Sir, sir, don't touch that! Are you licensed? Do you have a permit? Have you been trained? Please put the bottle up on the counter. Please, right there, yes. And hands off. Psht. Don't risk it, bro. [instrumental music] Don't you know that a plastic bottle is extremely hazardous and requires... Don't touch it! Requires layers and layers of intrusive and extremely expensive bureaucracy before they can be handled. Oooh. [instrumental music] [instrumental music] Who am I kidding? I understand what this is about, I get it. I'm a business owner. You want to bully scrappers and recyclers with trumped up fines and permits and dummy regulations that will apply not just to me and my business but to every school kid can drive across the state, until only you are allowed to run our businesses. And all of our profits are funneled into your budgets. I get it, that's what this is about. You know it and I know it. Theft by regulation. So do it, steal from me and from my business. Go ahead, but you will still end up with the short end of the stick because you're the ones stuck being you. Sir, I would rather live my life poor and robbed than as a swollen little city spider draining anything small enough for me to tangle up and kill. He's right. If you want to come after me and my business, do it. And I will fight you. I will fight you until I drop. I will do it for my family and I will do it for that team. And you'll probably win. And the grand prize is what? A few bucks and sucking as humans. Is it worth it? Mr. Miller, I believe this would be a wonderful opportunity to drop the microphone. [instrumental music] [instrumental music] [instrumental music] [instrumental music] [instrumental music] [instrumental music] [instrumental music] [instrumental music] Well, that's why I show up to these things. [instrumental music] And here we see Cody in his native habitat. For now he basks in the sun saving his strength, chin freshly marked from battle. Shorts, short, but not short enough. He will soon go into the wild ready to find a mate. In your face! [instrumental music] Hey Maddie, can you watch these steaks for a second? [instrumental music] Oh no. No, you didn't. Oh no, no. You didn't? Really, you would take from a family member? I would. There is no shame. You gave it up. You know and it was great. I'd do it again, in a heartbeat. But I also give, as in a birthday gift for my niece. Here we go. No, no, no, you're not giving me a dog. I am. Here you go. No, no, no. No, absolutely not. Why, look at it. Coo, coo, coo. No, this is on you. Bring it in here. Once Maddie kills you, then I get the car back. - Come on. - I'm not afraid of Maddie. Are you afraid of Maddie? For his birthday, we'll get him a pooper-scooper. Pops isn't here anymore. He's got better places to be. But the family he built is still here. Mom, keeping us from all flying apart, making sure we stick together, never forgetting the important things. My dad, trying to be strong enough to hold our whole world up by himself, learning that he can't. Uncle Ben and Bea, making sure no one stops laughing for too long. And me, trying hard, being stupid and learning. One more thing Pops used to say to me, "Cody, this life ain't perfect, but it's yours. Loving it is the best way of living it."
