(MultiCom Jingle) (mellow music) - I love everything about you. - You have good taste. - I hope we never change. - We never will. I will love you forever. - Forever? - Yeah, and ever. (bird cawing) (alarm chirping) - Boy, I had the weirdest dream. Santa Rosita, Mexico, our honeymoon. We never went back, honey. We always said we'd go back. - We're going to Europe, remember? - [Barbara] Mm. - I hate that alarm clock. - Boy, have we ever changed. ♪ Wake up now little girl ♪ - My clothes took up both bags and I'm still not done, so I don't know if I'm gonna be able to fit my stereo in the car. - Maybe you can get it when you come home at Christmas. (scoffs) - Sweetie, I'm sure there will be lots of kids in the dorm who have stereos. - Oh, I gotta go to the cleaners. I didn't pick up my jacket. - And I'll pick up your jacket at the cleaners on my way home from work. - [Daughter] Thanks, Mom. - Yep. - I gotta go, bye Dad. - Bye, baby. - Bye. - Hear that? - [Ken] Hmm. - The silence. Remember how quiet we thought things were after Neil moved out? - [Ken] Mm hmm. - Tonight it's gonna seem like the whole world stopped. For the first time in over 20 years it's gonna be just you and me. - Just the way we started. - Yeah. (machines humming) - Hey, Bobby. - Yes, sir? - What happened last week? I dropped two hot issues right in your lap. - Well, sir, with the market seesawing-- - I got another one for you. Beck Tech Corporation, pharmaceuticals. - Yeah. - Here's a research report. I want you to push it and get back on the stick. - Yes, sir. - Sims. I want to see you in my office. (phone ringing) (door shuts) (sighs) - [Intercom] Janet, pick up escrow line two. Escrow line two. (laughing and giggling) - Don't you ever get tired of his jokes? - Oh who, Rev? Oh. He's cute (laughing). - I'm making a mess. - Oh what's the matter? - Rushing too much. I told Irene I'd come home early and help her pack. - Oh that's right. Today's the big day isn't it? - Bigger than I thought. I feel like my whole world's falling out from underneath me. - That's how I felt when I got divorced. I thought, my God, what's left? But it wasn't like that at all. I started using the city more. I started going to plays and parties. I took up tennis, horseback riding, all the things I should have done while I was still married. Uh huh. (phone ringing) - Well the report says that the company is about to go through the roof so if we could... Well if something else comes along, I'll be glad to give you (dial tone) a call. Hmm. (office machines humming) (door closes) - What's shaking guy? - Sims got canned. - Ah political decision. They're bringing in some hot shot from the Big Apple and they say... Stan. Yeah, I got the figures right in front of me. It's already up two points. The sooner we move the better. You got it pal, talk to you later. - I lost three clients this week and it's only Monday. - I keep telling you, get out in the field, shake some hands, look them in the eye. - I do better on the phone. - [Derek] You just said you were doing terrible. - Well. - The only way you're gonna get new clients is to go out and get them. The only thing you're going to get sitting behind this desk is an ulcer and a heart attack. (sighs) (door slams) (sighs) (upbeat music) - I remember when I went away to college. I got homesick the first day. Kind of feel that way now. - Homesick? - Like I'm losing something. I remember bringing you home from the hospital like it was yesterday. It was raining outside, the column next door-- - Mom, mom I'll be home for summer vacation and Christmas and all of the holidays. - I know. I'm just being sentimental. Maybe you could go in the morning and then... (phone ringing) - I'll get it! (phone ringing) (laughing) - Hot stuff. - Startled me. - Your parents are here. - Can you believe I used to wear this kind of thing? - Well, I just, I never had the legs for 'em so. It's hard to believe that she's going away. - Yeah. It's just beginning to hit me. - Mm. (laughing) - I got your bags Irene-dene. - Darling I made a little something for you to nibble on in the car. - Brownies, right? - Oh, I'm going to weigh a ton by the time I get to school. - You can afford it. I fixed the same thing for your mother when she was going off to college and she was even skinnier than you are. - Back in the ice age. - Oh darling. - [Irene] Grandpa. - So long sweetheart. - [Irene] Grandma. - Oh my sweet, have fun. - [Irene] I will. - I'm going to miss you Beanie. - Mom. - You don't know how much I'm going to miss you. - I love you. - I love you baby. - Have a safe trip now. - I will. - Bye. - Bye. - Careful. - [Irene] Bye-bye. - Bye sweetheart. (car door shuts) (door shuts) (dog barking) - Here's a good package. (television playing) Nah, leaves out France. (electronic beeping) Maybe France isn't important. What do you think? You don't think we should skip France, do you? - I think we should skip talking about it until the summer. We're not going 'til the fall. - But we can do some things to get ready for Europe. I mean, we're going to be dancing and swimming, going to dinner. We haven't done those things for years. - I don't need any practice going out to dinner. (laughing) - Honey, we have a whole new life in front of us and we don't need to wait for Europe to start enjoying it. Seems like the only thing that we do around here is get up, go to work, watch TV, go to bed. - That's all most people do. - I'd like a little romance back in our lives. - Romance? - Get out more. Plays. Parties. Dancing. Really use the city. I'll bet you don't even remember how to dance. - You wanna bet?

And preservatives. And monosodium glutamate. And food coloring. White bread! (sighs) - If we're going to be eating such a natural diet, why do we need all these supplement things for. - This book says it's almost impossible to eat a natural diet. Everything's grown with pesticides and insecticides, chemicals, hormones, additives. - Yeah but all this stuff is natural isn't it? - Yes it's natural but it's grown in a polluted world. Depleted soil, toxic air, acid rain. There's a whole chapter on it in here. - Organic deodorant. Barb, Barb, we gotta hustle. The gym's gonna close in an hour. - We may have to miss it tonight. - What are you talking about? This is only our second night. - I don't know about the gym. You know, it's sweaty, it's crowded. - Barb, come on, I like going to the gym. It's got all the equipment, it's open at night. - I wish you wouldn't do that. - Do what? - Look away from me when I'm talking to you. - I didn't, I didn't.

Hey, you went shopping. - Barbara, shouldn't we have talked about this? - Honey, it's a one day special. I had to grab it. Besides, we have 30 days to try it out. Gee, that's a great jacket.

You're on a diet too, huh? - Oh, sorry. What? - I was just commenting on your diet, that's all. - Oh this. I'm on raw foods. I'm not allowed to cook or steam anything for 30 days. - Is that how you stay so calm down there in the pit all day long? - [Woman] No, I just use these to keep the noise out when I'm reading. - What's your secret?

She has fallen absolutely in love with him. - It all happened so fast. Pretty soon you'll have grandkids. - Uh uh, no, she's still a baby. She won't have kids for another 10 years. I hate you. - I hate diets. The only diet that ever worked for me was my divorce. I got rid of 165 pounds in one day. (laughing) Oh I like this here. - Come on. (juicer churring) - We had a long talk about it. She says if you eat everything raw, you don't need vitamins. - Well I read an article saying that was dangerous, especially with raw milk. - She doesn't eat any dairy products at all but I should tell her about the article. Which one was it? - I don't remember, I read so many by now. How long has she been working there anyway? - Margo? A couple of months. She knows all about this stuff. Yoga, meditation, diet, you know. - Really? - Just the way I like it. Raw. Ahhh. Hey Bill. Hey, I got a hot new issue for you. Oh it's way undervalued. Yeah, it's just what you need in this market. Well, I'd rather come over and show you in person if you don't mind. You call it. Two o'clock. Perfect, I'll be there. Hey Derek, you're absolutely right. You gotta get back in the field, look 'em in the eye. You know, I picked up two new clients already this week? - Great, I told you so. - Yeah, and you know all that hype about fitness and diet? It's not hype at all. I feel like a new man. - Now all you have to do is get rid of some of the salt and pepper around the edges and you'll look as good as you feel. - That's my mark of maturity. - It's the mark of old age. This is the 1980's guy. Special effects, optical illusions. Look how we elect politicians. Reagan's in his 70's and not one gray hair. - Reagan doesn't color his hair. - The point is that today, reality is all illusion. It's a big game, but it's one we all have to play if we want to stay out front and with this new kid in from New York, we're going to need all the help we can get. I'm going to do you a favor.

Ken, this is Zoe. - Hi. Hi. - I'm going in for a trim, I'll catch you later. - Uh, Derek. - Have a seat. - I was thinking that maybe we could just do like a consultation. - You could do with a toner. But if you really want to shake off a few years, you should get a facial. - Facial? - That would get rid of all that dead skin under your nose. Lots of men have it done. - What else do men have done? - Pedicures, tints, chest waxing, massaging. - Chest waxing? - (laughing) You don't need a chest wax but you could use a face mask while the color's processing. - Color? What color? - Something to get rid of the gray. But I'd recommend a trim first.

What kind of barber was this? - Just some guy Derek knows, I don't know I don't think it made all that much difference, really. - Face cream never did that for my face. - I think it's mostly just the diet and the exercise. You know, you were absolutely right about that darlin'. I feel terrific. In fact, I think I'm going to go upstairs and change and whip out a few reps before din-din. - Great hon. (bell ringing) - Okay let's see, we got tummy trimmer for my sis, vitamins for your dad, exercise video for Irene. - Suck it up, tough it out. - Think of Europe. - Spanish villas. - Greek Islands. - Bavarian castle. - French pastries... Bakeries! Beaches - Beaches. - Oh we had carolers come by yesterday. They haven't done that in years. - I remember I used to do that every year. Door to door. - [Man] Bobby, clean your plate. - Neil called from London, didn't he dear? - Yes. - He said there are carolers all over town. - [Man] A Charles Dickens Christmas. How does he like the snow? - [Ken] He hates it. - [Man] That's what I miss out here, the seasons. - Well I'm finished. It was wonderful grandma. - Ah thank you darling. - And I'm stuffed, where's dessert? - I'll get it. - All right now we'll see what kind of a diet you're really on. I've seen what she brought and it's absolutely sinful. - Look mom, I don't need another lecture on how I'm poisoning myself with Christmas dinner. - I know honey, it's just I know so much about this stuff now. - [Irene] And it's all you talk about. Diet, diet, diet. Mom, I am not even fat. - Yes, but that doesn't mean you're healthy. - I can't even cook an egg without getting a lecture. - An egg is over 300 milligrams of cholesterol, then you fry it in butter, you add salt, then you want to butter your toast. - Here, I'll wait for dessert. - Good. - [Group] Oh, yay! (clapping) - [Man] Looks terrific. - [Woman] Oh it's beautiful. - Okay, first piece to Krista. - Looks good. - There you are, right on down. - Okay now don't touch until everyone's served. - Alexandra, there you are. - And that's for you. (guests chattering amongst themselves) - [Barbara] There we go. Okay, one, two, three. Dig in! - What is this? - Buckwheat supreme. It's layers of carob chips, cashew butter, honey, wheat germ and it's filled with non-fat yogurt, blended with fresh strawberries and it's topped with whipped soy milk. You like it? - Mm. - She worked very, very hard at it. - It's good mom. - Well I know it's not your normal holiday fare but I thought it would be good for us. - Oh I nearly forgot. The Christmas cookies. (everyone clapping) - There we are. Now, help yourselves. There's lots more in the kitchen. - I made it so we could have a nice Christmas and still stick to our diet. - I had one little cookie. - Yes, and then you brought home a whole box. - What was I supposed to do? She's your mother, she practically forced them on us. - It is everything we don't want in this house: butter, eggs, salt, sugar, chocolate. - So we'll throw them away, throw them away! - What? Wait, what why? - Because if we start with cookies in this house, we will end up right where we began. - Fine! I'm going upstairs! - Happy Barbara? - I could have used a little more support. - She's 17 years old, she can eat whatever she wants. - Not in this house. - She said she'd take them upstairs to her room. - Fine, if you want to encourage her to poison herself. - I didn't say that. - Then why didn't you say no when my mother gave them to you? - Barbara, I thought the whole idea of this was for us to have more fun together. (yelling) Well this is the worst Christmas I've ever had! (sighs) (upbeat music) - [Amy] You know it used to be you only had to shop once for Christmas. Now you have to go back a second time and return everything. - [Barbara] Everything but the fat. I'm right back where I started. - Oh, post-holiday pig out blues. - And Ken still looks terrific. - Well men age better. Hey, do you want one? - I wish I could. How come you never gain weight? - Prescription diet pills. - Well that's not exactly au naturale. - Well you think it's natural to take all the vitamin C from a thousand oranges and put it into one little pill? Now if you take these, you can eat almost anything you want. - Why is that? - Because you're almost never hungry. Here, pop a few and we'll celebrate. - No. - In there, one, two, three. (laughing) - He opens the front door and he's standing there, I gotta use the bathroom. (laughing) - Wait, no wait, wait, I got... - Front door of the room. (snoring) - I ate a hot fudge sundae today. (snoring) I was so mad at you eating all those cookies. I went out and ate a whole hot fudge sundae. It took me seven weeks to lose 12 pounds and now I've gained it all back. Amy gave me some diet pills and now I can't go to sleep. - Diet pills? - I feel awful. I have a headache. - Oh honey. You shouldn't take any more diet pills. - I know I don't, but I don't want to look like this forever either. I haven't lost one inch off my saddlebags. - But we're feeling better, aren't we? - We're not any happier. Now instead of watching TV, we just exercise. - But that's what you wanted, isn't it? - I wanted us to do things together. Take up tennis, go horseback riding. - Horseback riding? - I'm not making any sense am I? - Oh Barbara. I wish I had more hair Barbara, I wish you had a flatter stomach, I wish I had a magic wand. - I'd give anything for a magic wand. (gentle music) - [Receptionist] Barbara pick up line two, Barbara line two. (gentle music) (laughing) (receptionist paging) - Why would a guy like that spend money to advertise? - You know him? - Oh sure, he's the best in the city. Been on all the talk shows. And he's done me from head to toe. - Amy! I knew you had your eyes done. - And my cheeks and my chin, a little down here, a little up here. Are you thinking of having it? - Me? No way. Amy, no. (elevator dings) (phone ringing) (door opening) (door closes) (door closes) (elevator dings) - All right why don't we begin with the eyes? Now this is what you can expect from lower eye surgery. Now lift your eyebrows just a bit. That's what upper eye surgery will do for you. Actually, you might consider having this suctioned out. Women show their age in their necks but you're much too young to have this turkey goblet look. Actually you could do with a chin implant. And possibly cheeks. - But I don't want to look like a different person. - Well to you it will be a big change but your friends will simply think you lost weight. - Lost weight? - Uh huh. - [Doctor] You see, bringing this forward would give you more of an neckline and take off the excess skin as well. - Why does my nose look so different here? - See, whenever we improve the chin imperfections and the nose, they become more apparent. It's a matter of balance, harmony if you will. I'll tell you what, if you really want to get fancy we can even add dimples and tattoo your eyeliner as well. Now, why don't we take a look at your body. Your thighs we can suction but right here you're going to have to have a little tummy tuck. - Cut it out? - Well I'll cut out about five pounds of fat, tighten the muscles and remove the excess skin from here down to the hairline. - But if you take it from here to here, I won't have a belly button. - So we'll give you a new one. It'll be much more perfect than the one you were born with. - What about scars? - Hopefully they'll be minor. You'll be able to hide them in your bikini. Just think Mrs. Laxton, your stretch marks will be gone forever, you'll have a nice flat tummy of a 12 year old. Now if you get everything done in two sessions, the neck and the face in one, the tummy and the breasts in the other, I will suction your thighs for free. Now that's a savings of over 2,000 dollars. - Still seems like an awful lot of money to me. - Well, it's all according to how you look at it. But just remember this, no book, no seminar, and no vacation will do for you what this will. And the greatest part of all, it's permanent. Yes, yes we can work on that. (gentle music) - Sizzling rice soup, broccoli, chicken and mixed vegetables. Mixed vegetables, thanks. - No MSG please. - No salt. - Or sugar and preferably steam everything. - Barbara, 10 years ago you would have thrown up over the mention of plastic surgery. - 10 years ago we didn't need it. - Honey, we don't need it now. - Wouldn't you like to see me with a nice, firm body? - Well of course I would but not this way. Anyway you're talking about spending the money for our trip to pay for it. - I'm talking about shortening our trip. 10 days instead of three weeks, that's all. - Barbara, it's for our 20th wedding anniversary. - Honey, this way when we came back, things would really be different. - With you maybe. - Maybe you could get your hair fixed. - [Ken] My hair? - Maybe your tummy. - My hair's not that bad. Do you think my hair's that bad? - I don't. You're the one who's always talking about it. - I think my hair's fine. - [Receptionist] Doctor Gordon, please call 7405. Doctor Gordon call 7405. - [Doctor] You're losing along the hairline Mr. Laxton and that's the most important part. It's what people look at so it has to be done very artistically. 10% medical, 90% artistic. - What happens if more falls out after I get this done? - We put more in. It's like with your friend Derek. See, I'm filling in for him as his own hair falls out. What we do is, we take tiny plugs from the back and implant them, in your case, in the front. You have very good donor hair by the way. - [Ken] Oh, why thank you. - [Doctor] Some people don't. To achieve a good fill, I'd recommend three sessions of about 80 grafts each. We could do them at four week intervals. - [Ken] Would I be able to comb it right away? - [Doctor] No, there's a dormant phase of about 90 days during which you won't have any growth whatsoever. But, after that, it'll grow in about half an inch a month. This is what you can expect to look like just six months after the first treatment. - What about my stomach doctor? Can you do anything about that? - No problem, we can suction that the same day we start the transplant and you might consider having me inject some of that fat back into your face. - Into my face? - Just to smooth out some of your deeper creases. If you're gonna have the hair you might as well have the face with it. - [Receptionist] Dr. Quinn, call your office. - I'm not going to tell you the whole world's going to change simply because you look younger. But you'll come back in six months, you'll tell me how it's changed. More friends, better job, better marriage, better sex. - I'll have (coughs) to talk to my wife about this first. - Of course. Show her the sketch. But just remember how people judge a book. - Thank you doctor. - Maybe we can take out a loan. - Darling why? We've saved for Europe. - Barbara we can't even afford to go to Hawaii if we do all this. We've already spent a fortune don't you know that? On the juicer and the gym stuff and the clothes and the vitamins. Do you know how many vitamins we-- - Maybe this is better than any vacation. I know lots of people who have had it done and they all love it. - Barbara, at these prices they can't afford not to love it. - Honey, prices are rock bottom, the market's flooded. - Oh I don't know. I guess Europe will always be there, won't it? - And now we'll be ready for it! - [Doctor] All right we're going to give you the oxygen now. Just count 10 backwards and relax. Doctor Strug, I don't, I think maybe... - [Doctor Strug] Just start counting backwards. Just start counting backwards. 10, nine, eight, like that. - [Barbara] Eight, seven, six. - [Dr. Strug] Okay why don't you do it to yourself. - [Doctor] Little sting here Mr. Laxton. (electronic music) (groans) - [Doctor] Okay? - Yeah, it's fine doctor. - Just 78 more of these to go. - [Doctor] Push the cheek up to the left. That's it. Okay. That looks good. Up to the left a little bit. Mommy you want to check my calls? - Little more pressure. There we go. Looking good back here, how are we doing up there? - Great doctor. - Good. Only 53 more to go. Gator clamp. - Glad to hear it. - She chose Miss September's breasts. Nice. - Last one. - Good doctor, but who's counting you know? - More suction. Good bye ice cream, good bye cake. Good bye pies and donuts. (gentle music) - (mumbling) How's your soup? - What? - How did you sleep? - Sleep? - Mm. - Ah, not so great. - It's gonna be a long winter Ken. (glasses clank) - [Ken] Oh! (suspenseful music) - Our best time yet. 23 minutes flat. - Afternoon girls. - Hi guy. Hey I saw Barbara yesterday in the supermarket. Whew. - Yeah? That's what she thinks about me. Hi Margo. - Hi. How's Samson today? - I'm great, I'm terrific. I've been married 20 years and 3 hours. - Congratulations. - Thank you. - So how come you didn't take the day off? - I can't afford to. How's everything with you? - Don't ask. - What's the matter? Too many raw foods (laughing)? - No, I've graduated to steamed vegetables. - Hey what's the problem? - My boyfriend, ex-boyfriend. Walked out on my last night. - That's terrible. What happened? - Oh you know the story. Another woman, younger, prettier. - [Ken] That's crazy. - I agree. Only sometimes I wonder. - Don't wonder about a thing, you're a terrific person. - No I mean, I wonder if people care about that? It seems the only thing people care about these days is... - I'm sorry, what'd you say? - Steamed vegetables. - Oh. - I'll let you know. I can't find it. Okay, all right, bye. Oh you look so good! Oh tonight's the big night, isn't it? - 20 years, hard to believe. I got a new dress, new shoes and an appointment at the hairdresser. - Oh you've got to use my guy. He'll do something really wild. Oh and if you want to make tonight something really wild. (whispering) - Amy! (upbeat music) - Hi. - Oh, yeah, hi. - Can I help you find something? - Sure, thank you. Yes, I'm looking for, I'd like a, it's for my anniversary. - Oh, how wonderful. How many years? - 15. - Well this also comes in red, black, blue, zebra and leopard. - Oh that's nice. - What size does she wear? - She's a, a, well she's-- - Is she small like me? - She used to be. (disco music) - I can't believe we're doing this. - [Ken] Yeah after three months of bruises and bandages. - Shhh, let's dance. - No, let's have a drink. - What? - Let's have a drink, a drink. - Okay. (disco music) - Can we have two Mai Tais please? Two Mai Tais. (disco music) - What is it? - What? - Let's boogie! (disco music) - I'll be back in a minute. ♪ I want to play with you tonight ♪ ♪ Hold me, that's all that's on my mind ♪ ♪ Baby, something feels so right ♪ ♪ Maybe we could play tonight ♪ ♪ I want to be so in love with you ♪ ♪ I want to do just what you want to do ♪ ♪ I want to be all that to you ♪ - Oh, I'm sorry!

What were you doing? I was only in the men's room for two minutes. - He danced me onto the floor, what was I supposed to say? - You could say no. - Next time I will. - What do you mean next time? - I didn't know you could be so jealous. - Well I never had so much to be jealous about before. - Neither did I Careful. - I guess this is going take some adjustment from both of us. - I think you're right. You know what else I think? - What else? - I think we should go home to bed. - Good idea. (romantic music) - Was it me? - No, no, no. I'm just tired, that's all. - Are you sure I feel natural? - Oh yeah, you feel fine. Just fine. - Guess it's a lot of pressure for one night, huh? - Yeah, yeah, that's it. And, you know, maybe we haven't healed yet. - Does your head still itch? - Yeah, a little. - I'm still puffy aren't I? - No, no honey you're fine. Just fine. - I guess we have to get used to this. - Yeah, yeah, that's it. It takes time, you know. - This will wash out in the shower. - Good. - Good night. - Good night. - What are you talking about? 2,000 shares? Get 10,000 shares at 52 1/2. You got it. - Derek. - [Derek] Yeah? - Can I ask you a question? - Shoot. - Are you really 49? - Shh. - Derek, all those women that you go out with all the time, you know. Do you ever ah, do you ever ah, you know, worry about, you know, you know, you know? - Oh yeah. - Yeah? - You bet I do. It's not like in the old days, believe you me. - Yeah, I guess we're not 21 anymore are we? - What difference does that make? - It makes all the difference in the world. I mean, I may look better but, you know, I'm not a kid anymore. - Well AIDS doesn't care what age you are. - AIDS? I'm not talking about AIDS. - No? - No, no, I mean do you ever, you know, just not feel in the mood? - Oh. Well not very long. You got a problem? - No, no not a problem exactly. - It's nothing to be ashamed of. If I were you, I'd go out and, well, you know, reinvest my dividends. - My what? - Well find a little distraction. - Distraction? - Put a little zing back into your life. Get a woman. - After 20 years of marriage? - If I'd learned this lesson sooner, well I'd probably still be married to my first wife. - Well I never did anything like that and I still am married to my first wife. - I don't know what it is. Maybe all this artificial stuff turns him off. - [Amy] Well now, maybe it does. You see, when I tell a guy that I was born with all this, he goes crazy. But if I tell him that I'm half plastic, he's out the door. - Wish you didn't have to go through this. All I wanted was a little more attention, a little more romance, have it be the way it was when we first me. - It will never be that way again. - Why? - Why don't you talk to him. Tell him what you want. - After all these years of marriage, if he really loved me, I wouldn't have to tell him. (copy machine running). - Oh hi, Margo. - Hi. - Any word from Harry? - Oh, I'm too busy to think about him. How was your anniversary? - Oh, it was not bad. - Good. - What are you so busy about? - The corporate VP made a surprise visit. He asked me to get these sales charts ready. Have you met him? He's over in Bill's office. - The bald guy? - [Margo] Yeah, he's great. He's got a booming career, a wonderful marriage and two terrific kids. AS far as I'm concerned, he is the ideal man. Yoo hoo, you okay? - Yeah, fine, fine. Listen, can we, I wanted to, I was, can we go someplace and talk about something? - Sure. - Yeah? - I'll be right back. - Okay, thanks. I don't know what women want. Barbara has this thing about recapturing youth. I really think that we were better off before we started this thing. - Everybody wants to be young again. - Do you? - I just want to stay healthy. - Yeah but do looks matter to you? - No, I like looking ugly. - Come on Margo, you know what I mean. - I know. You want to know what I care about? - What? - The emotional parts of a person. The spiritual parts. Especially if it's with my significant other. - Your what? - Husband, wife. - Oh. - Boyfriend, whatever. - Well whatever I'm doing with my significant other is definitely not working. I don't know what I'm supposed to be anymore. - Have you tried talking to her about it? - It's not that easy. - Why not? - We spent our life savings on this stuff, you know? We gave up our trip to Europe. We spent months suffering with bruises and bandages. What am I supposed to say now? Oops, I think we made a mistake? - Yes, sure I'll tell him. Yep, okay so we'll see you tomorrow. I can hardly wait. Bye. - She on the way? - She and her boyfriend. - Her boyfriend? - She asked if he can stay here a few days on his way down to San Diego. - Barbara, you mean she's going to see us for the first time like this with her boyfriend? What's he gonna think? - Well she said not to mention it. She doesn't want her first impression-- - Mention it? Barbara, she doesn't know what we look like. She hasn't even seen any pictures. - Well of course not, we've been in bandages. - I think we have to talk about this. - All right, we will. He's only going to be here a few days. - No. - Now I'm gonna go upstairs and fix Neil's room. Everything's going to be all right. - Yeah as long as she tells him we're her brother and sister. (pensive music) (horn honking) - She's here! - Great, great! - Okay, wait Whoa, whoa, hey no. - I just brushed it. - Well I want us to look nice. - We look fine. I just wish she'd seen pictures of us first. - What if she doesn't like it? - Relax sweetie, you're making me nervous. - Irene! Hi honey, how are you? Oh golly we missed you. - We missed you so much. - I missed you too. - Good. - Oh, ah, this is Monte. Monte, this is my mom and dad. - Hi Hi. - Hi Monte, how are you? - Fine. - Ken, Barbara. - You guys look great. I don't think I've ever seen you in shorts before. - Oh shorts, yeah shorts. So Monte, you're from San Diego, is that right? - What? Oh, yeah. La Jolla actually. - La Jolla, it's beautiful down there, we love it. We go there all the time to get out of the city. Irene says you're an arts student? - [Monte] Yes. - Well, what do you think? - I don't know mom. You look different. - Yes, but do you like it? - [Irene] You look fine, I thought you looked fine before mom. No, you should see the old pictures. I mean we were awful. We needed this change. - I just have to get used to it, that's all. - [Barbara] You will. Now tell me all about this Monte. - So Monte, what are you going to do after you graduate? - I'm hoping to go to Italy to do my graduate work. My real interest is fine art. Painting, sculpture. He's quite talented. - Do you like the food? - Yeah, yeah it's great. - Except we really shouldn't combine carbos with protein. Did I tell you that? You know that chart we have is all wrong. - Where did you hear that? - Broker at work. - Which one? - Margo Harris. I told you about her. - The one who's boyfriend left her? - Right. - There you go. - You do have talent. - Well it's hard to miss when you have the right model. (laughing) - [Receptionist] Escrow department, please pick up line 277. Escrow department, line 277. (telephone ringing) - Cute client. A walk in? - Yeah and I walked him right back out again too. - Why? - He wanted to talk houses over dinner. - Well, so? - So I told him to shop elsewhere. What was for sale around here was real estate, not me. - You don't have to have dinner with the guy, just play along. Get the sale. It's all part of the game. - Well I don't play that game. - Are you kidding? Look at yourself. You made all these changes and the minute a guy notices you, you get mad at him. - I didn't do this to sell more houses or to be leered at by strangers. I did it - To put a little more romance into your life. I know. But that doesn't mean that you can't turn your investment into a profit. - Anybody home? Hello? Barbara? (knocking on door) - It's open. - Hi, where is everybody? - I don't know. - Oh baby. Are you upset about something? - My hair. - Your hair? What's wrong with it? - It looks terrible. - It looks fine. Anyway of all Monte cares about is the way you look, he's probably not worth it. - You should talk. - Why? What are you so grumpy about? Did you guys have a fight? - No. - Well where is he? Where's your mother? - She's probably out getting a nose job. - Now Irene, that... - [Barbara] I'm telling you that's where it was. (door slams) It was amazing. - And you want to have a seat right there. - [Ken] Hi. - Hi honey. - Where you been? - Monte came by the office and took me for coffee and he says we've been doing this all wrong. So he's going to show me. - All right now pull the bar down behind your back, at 6. And you want to keep an arch in the lower back. Good, feel the resistance right there? - [Barbara] Oh I do, that's great. You should try this. - Yeah. - [Monte] And you also want to feel it in your pecs, right there, and upper back. - Ooh. - Feel that resistance? We're late. - Listen, if you guys aren't doing anything, you're more than welcome to come along with us. - Monte! - Where are you going? - To an art show. - And we're late. - [Barbara] Thanks Monte. - Bye. - [Barbara] Bye. You look lovely baby. (door slams) What's wrong with her? - She's obviously jealous. - Yes, of what? - Of you. - That's ridiculous. - Barbara, her boyfriend had his hands all over you. - Come on, I'm her mother! - Barbara, maybe if you look a little more like a mother, he wouldn't be so interested. - If I looked? Just because you gawk at everything in skirts darlin' doesn't mean that Monte does. - What are you talking about? - You know what I'm talking about. You do not exercise every time-- - More than just looks, I appreciate the spiritual parts of a person, the emotional parts, especially when I'm with my significant other. - Your what? - My significant other. - Where'd you get that phrase? - Margo. - Margo! Have you been telling her everything about us? - No. - I mean have you been telling her about our private lives? Do you tell her all our secrets? Just who is this Margo anyway? - She's a friend. - A friend. Well I'm glad to see that you talk to your friends more than you talk to me. - Well that's because you never listen! - I don't know how to say this. It's about my mom. - What about her? - It's hard to talk about. She's not real. - What do you mean she's not real? - That's my real mom and dad. - Oo. - They changed themselves surgically. Her body isn't real. Neither is her face. She's not even pretty. And my dad's hair. He's almost bald. I know it must be a real turnoff for you to find out that my mom's half plastic. - No, it's definitely not a turnoff. I think your mom's great. I think it's wonderful that she'd do something like that. - You do? - [Monte] Yes. I was thinking maybe you could do something like that. Eventually. You're nose, just the bridge. - My nose? What's wrong with my nose? - Don't get mad. - Is that all you care about? The way I look? - I just thought if you changed a few things that-- - No, I think you ought to change something. Your girlfriend. (office chatter) (phone buzzing) - Hello, Margo. - Hi. - Hi. - Can we talk? - Sure, when? - How about lunch? - Terrific. - About a half hour? Okay, okay. (phone ringing) - Laxton. - Hi. - [Ken] Oh hi. - I'm sorry about last night. - Aw no honey, I should have blown up at you like that. - I thought maybe we can have lunch and talk about it? - Lunch? I really can't. I'd love to but I've made plans. - Okay, that's fine. - [Ken] How about if I come home early tonight and we'll talk then? - All right, great, we'll talk tonight. - Okay, I love you sweetheart. - I love you too. Bye. - Got me a free lunch. See you later gorgeous, bye. (laughing) (suspenseful music) - I don't know, maybe I ought to go to the other extreme. You know, shave my head, maybe she'd like that better. (Margo laughing) Of course, I'd lose half my clients. - Wait, you think you have more clients because you look different? (suspenseful music) - Well my client list has practically doubled since I made these changes. - That's because you have more confidence, not because you look different. - Yeah but I got the confidence because of the way I look. It hasn't worked any magic with Barbara, I can tell you that. Well, maybe magic isn't what you need. Maybe you need to get to know Barbara again. - Maybe she ought to try to get to know me? - [Margo] Ken. - How do I get to know her again? - Well you're not going to do it by talking to me. - Yeah but if I stop talking to Barbara, who's going to talk to you? - Harry. He called me last night. - He did? - Yes and then he came over, said he was sorry. He said everything I wanted to hear. - And then what happened? - That's it Ken, you're not going to get anything else out of me. - Oh I'm happy for you. (suspenseful music) - [Barbara] What's the matter? - May I come in? - What happened? - Irene kicked me out, she took off with a friend. - Why? - She told me what you did. - What? - Your surgery. No, it doesn't bother me. I like it. I told her she ought to take better care of herself, be a little more like you. - More like me? - Yeah, I mean you're into perfection, right? - I'm into my life and right now, my life is a mess. - [Monte] Well I just thought-- - I don't want to hear what you thought. I want you to leave here. (door slams) - Barbara? Barbara? Barbara? I'm home. Barbara? Barbara? Barbara, what's going on? Didn't you hear me when I came in? For you. What's wrong? What are you doing? You're packing. - Bingo. I'm leaving. - Why? What happened? - Your little lunchtime rendezvous in the park, that's what happened. - With Margo? - So that's the infamous Margo. Well let me tell you something mister. I'm not going to sit around here while you sow your wild menopausal oats. - She's a friend! - I could understand it if you were with some raving beauty. - Wait a minute, wait a minute, look. Aren't you the one that said looks aren't everything? Besides, Margo's a nice person. She's a warm, sweet, generous-- - Concubine. - Friend! Barbara, Barbara, Barbara wait, look. I didn't come home to fight with you, I came home to talk. What do you think these are? A declaration of war? - No, I think they're a big beautiful bouquet of guilt. - Barbara! Aw Barbara, Barbara will you listen to me? Just listen for a minute will you? Barbara, take a minute and listen to me. Barbara, Barbara, Barbara, will you listen to me! Will you talk to me for a second! Barbara I think that we made a mistake, don't you see that? We made a mistake with the whole thing. - You made a mistake when you thought just because you look 20 years younger, you can act like you're in college. - You're the one that wanted to be 20 years old. You're the one who started all this in the first place! - Me! - First the diet, then the vitamins. Those vitamins and the gym and the surgery and the liposuction! I hated that! - Nobody put a gun to your head. I just wanted to make our marriage a little happier for both of us! - Barbara I changed my whole life for you! I changed everything! - I changed mine too! (car engine roaring) - [Ken] Barbara! If we loved each other we wouldn't have to change! (car roaring) (car tires squealing) (door closes) (sniffling) (car horn honking) - After all I've done for him. 20 years of marriage, down the toilet. (hubcap rattling) (doorbell ringing) - Yes. Barbara? Oh what happened? Well you look a wreck. - I don't care! - What do you mean you don't care? - Don't! - But you look awful. - Who cares what I look like. My entire life is in shambles and all you can think about is my hair? - [Esther] Is it Ken? (crying) Oh my God. - It's over, we're finished. - [Esther] Oh my darling, there, there now. Shh. (telephone ringing) - Hello? No, this is her daughter. What? What happened? - [Receptionist] Doctor Gordon to ICU. - But there's no point in staying here all night. - I don't want to leave him. - We'll come back tomorrow when he's awake. - I didn't mean for this to happen. I just got so angry when I saw that woman. - Let's go home. Do you want some tea? - [Barbara] Yeah. I hate these things. They've ruined my life. - They haven't ruined your life. Look, this was all great when you guys started but then you got obsessed with it, with the diet and the surgery. When you tried to be perfect, that's when it all went crazy. You can't blame the machines for it, or the diet or the doctors. They didn't make you do it, it isn't their fault. - It's not my fault your dad's having an affair either. - How do you even know he is having an affair? And even if he is, he needs you mom. He loves you. - I love him too. - There was never anything wrong with the way you looked. - Well, there certainly wasn't anything wrong with the way you looked, no matter what that old Monte said. - He's a jerk anyway. The sooner I found out the better. - Thank you. (elevator dings) Did you call his office? - Yeah I talked to Derek and he's going to go over Dad's accounts until he gets back. - Great. - Mom, you look fine. - Barbara. - Barbara, I'm Margo Harris. This is my fiancee Harry. - Barbara, Margo. Hi. Harry. Irene. - Hi nice to meet you. - Hi honey. I just wanted to put a little romance back into our lives, that's all. - You wanted more than that. You wanted me to be 20 years old again. - I did not. - Oh yes you did and then you wanted to be 20 years old again. - I just wanted to be closer to you. I thought if I were more attractive, that would do it. - Honey, you've always been attractive. I know. So why do I look at other women, right? - Is it because I'm not good enough for you? - No, no, of course not. When I look at pretty women, the only thing it means is that I enjoy looking at pretty women. I don't think I can change that. I think all men do that. But I can change the way I do it. And when. - I'd like that. - [Woman] Mr. and Mrs. Laxton? - Yes? Yes? - Hello, I'm Doctor Teal. I was given your xrays to examine and it looks like we're going to have to reconstruct a few of your features. - My features? - Nose, chin, nothing we can't fix. Now, I think that a roman arch might look really good on you but you can have your pick of any shape that you want. - I don't want to pick any shape I want. I want my old face back. - You don't want anything different? - No, I want my old nose, I want my old chin and I want all the wrinkles right were they were. - Oh, I'm surprised. Most people have at least one thing that they want to change. - That's because most people don't appreciate what they had to begin with. - Aw. Thank you. (gentle music) - Too bad we couldn't go to Europe. - Oh never mind Europe. At least we got to Santa Rosita. - It's hard to believe it's the same place. - Yeah, I guess everything changes. - Except one thing. I love you forever. (upbeat music)
