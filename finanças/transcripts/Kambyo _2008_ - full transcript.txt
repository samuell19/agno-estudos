Dude, are they here already? Xaves is not telling about his location. Marco's phone is still dead. I?m getting bored. Let s put some music on. Go try and play your music. Oh fuck! You have no music player. Are you kidding me? I?m sure it had one several years back. lt must have been disposed already. So what are we supposed to do here? - Bore ourselves to death? - G ind a way t put music in your ears. Now, l think l want to do something. Stop bothering me. Why don't you just call the guys up again? I?ve been calling them for the longest time. Give me a break! You're crazy! We could get caught by a police officer. You ll be dragging me off to jail with you. Just chill up! No one s in here. it s too early for any police officer to be roaming around. That's what you think! They could be hiding in one of those trees... so they can extort money from little criminais like you! Man, you re crazy! Oh! Xavier's here And he's got someone with him. is that new guy your friend? l haven t met him. He s probably Xavier s new boyfriend. Xavier is such a flirt! He just reminds you of what you've never had! - Asshole! - Hey, guys! We've been waiting for you for the longest time! - Got lots of cash with you? - Why sound so arrogant? What's with you? Oh well! l just finished a show last night. So, I?ve got some cash to spend on! - By the way, where's Marco? - Yeah, where s that asshole? We?ve been sending him text messages. But there s no reply. Most probably, he has changed numbers again. He's been changing numbers all the time! He hasn't been showing up at the dormitory. Hey guys, this is Aldo, my friend. - I m AIdo. - Macky, here. l m Manuel. And he s joining us! Don t worry. I?ll take care of him. Let's get in. lt will take us a few more hours to get to our destination. What made you decide to go to La Union. They said, the beach there is nice. Besides, the boys there are said to be hot! - And for that, that's the place to be! - La Union, here we come! Who s that guy with you? He s Aldo. l introduced him to you, right? And since when did he become your friend? A while ago... in Philcoa. You son of a bitch. You just sucked his cock a while ago now, you asked him to join us? How do we know if he can be trusted? You re over-reacting. The guy is too cute. He certainly could not do us any harm. You re crazy. Don't worry. l m in charge of the guy. Everything is on me. Okay? Go to hell! Aldo, l hope you'll be comfortable with us. I?ll just introduce ourselves again. Michael is my real name I just finished BS Math in University of the Philippines. Manuel is my cousin. He just finished Philosophy. Xavier and Manuel share the same dormitory. With Xavier, it s hard to tell when he plans to finish his school. He prioritizes his work and other outside stuff. - Sorry, but who is Xavier? - l am Xavier! l was 'John' when l met him. You always use different names. How about you? is ' Aldo' your real name? - Yeah. Crisaldo is my first name. - Are you still a student? I?m working. But my work contract has just ended. - What s your work? - At a department store. Are you guys friends for a long time? How come, your girl friends are not with you ? We can't bring them because we have you! My girlfriend is on a vacation in Davao. Manuel just broke off with his girlfriend two months ago Hey, they might see us! Don?t mind them. These guys are not straight men. They won't be my friends if they were straight in the first place! Hey man, I?m straight! You claim to be straight just because you have a Playboy magazine in here? How can you be straight when you have accounts in a gay chat online? Macky and Manuel, you guys better admit your real sexual preferences! Well, for one we are not like you! A hungry cocksucker! Oh yes. l remember Manuel to be very straight. His first girlfriend? A lady boy with fake boobs whose penis is hidden between his butt cheeks! But she s certainly more beautiful... than any other girls I have met during that time! But you know what... even if he sounds like that, it s not very hard to get him into bed. - Have you two tried having sex together? - Oh! That certainly will not happen! They are my friends. And l don t do friends! But here s what l can assure you. I am their one and only sexual inspiration! I fulfill all their sexual fantasies! - Get off man! You're humiliating us! - What a sissy! Don't even dare to compare me to you. Don?t even dare to compare me to you. I may be curious but I've never had any sexual experience with any man! Well as soon as you have one... l will surely update your girlfriend Kathy about it. Go ahead. l will kick your ass! I never wanted to be oversexed just like you! Oversexed? is it my fault that they all crave for my sexual prowess? What are you talking about? Look, one of my fuck buddies even confessed... that because l suck so good, he can finish writing a poem in his head! Oh crap! He even sent one of those in my phone. Hold on , let me read it to you. 'l want to be Penis Even for Just a Night Because the penis is immensely powerful People stare at it Crave for it Kneel before it Just like an image of a saint, always whispered with prayers' . There's Xaves. Don't stop for him! Hey asshole, that's my money you used for those food! We can take that road. N. l don't know where that could lead us to. - l'd rather g straight ahead. - But it says ''To Baguio''. Baguio is right before La Union! Make sure you guys know this rad. l don't want to get lost. Trust me! Look at those cows. You won't see them in Manila. Of course. There are cows in Manila. They are just dead and sold in the meat shops. Don't you just like the fresh air? - Dude, have some... - Thanks! What?s your new job? I?m a merchandiser at the new supermarket in Congressional Why don't you try working as a customer service representative in a call center? Right. There s more money there. Your aunt owns a call center in Ortigas, right? l can t work in there. I?m not good in speaking English. You just need a few training sessions for that. That s easier than switching jobs every time your contract expires after six months. in a call center, after six months, you?ll be a regular employee. Don t worry. I?m used to switching jobs. Well, change is the most permanent thing in this world. Talk about change, go ask Manuel about it. He's got so many principles in life. One of which is his claim that a big revolution is about... to happen in our society any moment from now. You said it right! Any plans of applying for work at any of the multinationals? Definitely not! Would never work for any of those assholes! They have helped perpetuate poverty in many countries all around the world. A few more years and some more work... the ruling class will soon be brought to the ground. Oh god! You are too idealistic. Stop caring too much about the society. Or else, it could just eat you alive. Just learn to adapt! Otherwise, you'll be bound for extinction. l agree. Because for a change to be effective, it has to happen gradually. So everyone else could adapt to it. Radical social changes just sound so outdated. - How about you, Aldo? - l don't have anything to say to that. For me, my secret to survive life, is just to keep on breathing. Wait, are we lost? We could ask for directions again if you want. l think we should. it might be better if we ask a police officer Good idea! And we might as well ask... - if they detain people carrying marijuana! - Asshole! There s a police checkpoint. Let s go ask. Sir, how do we get to Urbiztondo, La Union? Go straight ahead. It?s about a kilometer from here. As soon as you see a signage of NFA, take a left turn on that intersection. Thank you sir! Hold it officer! You forgot to check the van for some illegal drugs! These officers are a son of a bitch! I?m so excited! l want to see the beach! - There s the NFA. We should turn left now! - Turn left there. Yes, right there over the billboard. There s an alley over there. Just go straight ahead. l think that s it. That s really it! This is it! Here we go! At last! Let s hit the beach! Hey men, do you know where this address is? - Just ask in the store. - Okay. Thanks! - Just ask in the store. - Okay. Thanks! Good afternoon sir! Do you know where l can find this address? This is our address. Are you looking for Philip? Yes. is he there? I?m sorry. But Philip doesn't live here anymore. He lives in Paoay with his wife. Are you a friend of him? l was his classmate in University of the Philippines. He gave me his address just in case l wanted to see the beach of La Union. - Where did you come from? - Manila. - How far is Paoay from here? - The place is near. it s just about a four hour drive from here. It?s too unfortunate that you are unable to see my nephew. Do you think l could pay him a surprise visit? - Can l get his address? - Let me write it down. I don t get it. Why do we have to go to Paoay? We re already here. We re in a beach! Just do it for me, okay. But Paoay is quite far from here! When we get there. It will be dark. We Won 't be able to enjoy the place anymore. Look, if you guys don't want to join me in Paoay, I can leave you here. I?ll just drop by for you tomorrow. 'I'II just drop by for you tomorrow. l m not forcing anyone to come with me to Paoay! Our stay there will be on me! Didn?t l just tell you l have always wanted to go to Paoay? Xaves, why don?t you guys just stay here in La Union if you don't to travel anymore? What? Just meet us tomorrow here? Hello! We want to go to Paoay! It?s a world heritage site! We re all for Paoay! Too much heat could have caused this tire to burst. I?ll just get the stuff at the back. I?ll help you out. - Fuck! We don t have a spare tire! - What? We took a long drive without a spare tire? place it farther. Sir, where could we find the nearest vulcanizing shop here? About two kilometers from here... How long would it take if we go there by foot? l couldn?t t say. is there any public transportation in here? None. - Thank you! - Thank you! l can go find the vulcanizing shop. l can do it fast. l can try to run. - Are you sure? - Yes. Thanks. Bring this money with you. I?ll come with you. There s a vehicle coming. Let's try to hitch a ride. More likely these people come from Manila. People with no compassion! Just be patient. We should almost be there. - I?m not used to a long walk. - What are you talking about? You?ve been walking and cruising the Circle Park last night. - And you didn't seem to be tired. - That's different. That was a leisure walk. This one is 'Walk for a cause. This place is beautiful. it reminds me of our place in Mindoro. It?s just like here. Then, why did you go to Manila? There s not much work in our place. ln Manila, there's a possibility that l can save up... so l can probably work outside of the country. How about you? Don t you want to go abroad for work after your studies? No. My life here is okay. in the Philippines, I can practically do whatever l want to do. in other countries, I?ll just be an ordinary employee. Here, l can make a lot of difference. You can say that because you were able to go to a good school. Yes. That s why l also feel socially responsible to share my knowledge here. You can say that because probably your family does not demand financial support from you. Well, they should never ask any support from me. How come? Well... I was given away by my parents ever since l was young. I didn?t like my foster parents as well. So after high school, l took it on my own. I was lucky to get a scholarship at my university. I am working part time to feed myself. So, whatever it is that l achieve in life, my family is never a part of it. Hence, they could never expect any form of support from me. That?s sad. Let?s go! Let me carry it this time. This tire s okay. is this okay enough to bring us back to Manila. - Certainly - How much? One hundred pesos. Thank you. Let s get some rest for a while. We will fet there in about half an hour. Well, it feels like l just took the treadmill for 3 hours! - Come on, let's get some rest. - Be patient. There s probably a truck or something that can give us a ride. it seems that you re so used to hitching a ride, huh? - Hey don t pinch my nipples! - Let s take a break for a while! Just leave the tire there. Do you want to write a poem? How? l don t write poems. Didn?t l tell you that my amazing skills in sucking a penis... - could inspire anyone to write a poem! - You've got lots of crap. Didn?t you just tell me you are tired? Only my legs are tired. But I?m still good for a game. Not my nipples... it gets uncomfortable. Do it faster. Just focus! Try to make a poem in your head. Someone is coming. Just concentrate! Lie in here. Ney that's our tire! Son of a bitch! Bring that back to us. Are you going to the job fair next week? More likely. I?m pressured to look for work. Father needs help with household bills. Hopefully, l could get work from an non-government organization. - How s aunt? - She hasn?t come home. What happened to your mom? l wouldn?t know. l haven't been thinking about it. How?s Bingbing? is she graduating? l heard she s not. She got some problems of her own. She has been thinking too much about boys. Father is not exactly very happy with her. - Why don't you help your little sister? - She s no longer my problem. - Of course, she is! - How about you, what s your plan? I?ll probably take a break for about three months before starting to look for a job. You re lucky to get a monthly remittance of Canadian dollars! Hey, my mother works hard for it taking care of white asses. - Here, they are! - What took you so long? Why don't you walk yourself and find out how far we ve been through? Oh, I?m sorry. Let s put this on. Son of bitch! I can't find it! - What is it that you re looking for? - My lotion . You re too vain. Macky, it's getting late. We might not be able to find Paoay anymore. We must be near. Let's find it. lt s getting dangerous. There s an inn. We could stay there for a night. Let s park here. - Do you still have a vacant room? - How many are you? - Four. - We still have rooms for you. Now much is your rate? - Two thousand two hundred pesos - That's okay. - That's just or overnight? - Yes. Not in my nipples. l get ticklish. You know what, l think l m in love with you! Why? My nipples start to get comfortable with your lips! Quit it! - Fuck me. - Not now. Why? Why, don't you fuck me instead? Too much effort! l m a bottom! So am l! So, you've got plans of going to Canada with your mom? Yes So l can earn money easier. What s the rush with earning so much money. You're not hard up. What l want is when l reach thirty years old... l already have one million pesos in investment. It?s okay to work for money, as long as you don t forget... that there's more to life than working for money. Hello police officer? l m positive! Our suspect here. We re here in La Union. Over. What an asshole. Come on, have a puff. - l don't take that anymore. - What do you take nowadays? Glutathione! Try, you'll get more beautiful... Let s get something to eat. We wanted to ask you to eat out, but you and Aldo are quite busy. You guys were eating something else. Oh well, l m sure you?ve never tasted what l have just been eating! Cheers! Let s go take something to eat. Go Aldo! l never expected. That things will change. Like the sweetness o our relationship... - is now buried in my dreams...'' - Which song are you looking or? Still trying to look for what s best for me. Were you crying while singing? - Yes. - Why? l just remembered something while singing. - Your lover? - No. You know, that s the song that l use whenever l join singing contests. l used to be a singer. But l always lose. l even got nasty comments from the judges. - Really humiliating. - is that right? l wanted to be a celebrity... a performer. My contemporaries are now very famous. They re rich while l m still a sales man selling videoke machines. Why didn?t you pursue your dream? it sounds like you know how to sing. That s gone. l have forgotten about that dream. l thought I?ll be famous. l was wrong. Don?t feel bad. We?re still young. We still have a lot of time to work for our dreams. It?s hard to tell. l have long stopped dreaming. Why sing that song? Dancing Queen? That's for sissies! - How come my song s not playing? - Sing's not playing because you're gay! Can you repeat the song please? How come so many gay men are sprouting everywhere? Hey technician. The song's not playing! Just let it go. Oh yeah, when you see him, He?s gotten so big. Hey sexy! How do you want to sing again? Don 't you talk that way to my friend. Asshole! Let s go! They may call out more friends. We might get killed here. You really have a problem with your temper! Those are assholes. You can't help but hit them. They asked for it. Think about it. We?re strangers here. They could have asked help from friends. Things could have gone worse than you expect it. i just can't take it when other people make fun of gay men! That?s beyond our control. We are in a conservative place. Their values are still different when it comes to that kind of stuff. We can certainly do something. We should teach them how to respect gay men! You know what your real problem is? You want to get involved in all issues in this world. Why don t you just think about your own personal issues and deal with them first? You like to pick on stuff bigger than who you are! Sadness can never be avoided in our lives. So join us my friend. We are leaving. We are lying towards the horizon. So we can escape from this world. Can you just forget about your problems? We are here! Here we go! This is beautiful! Capture the moment. Stay here! Give me a wacky moment! Let s try the other side! One... two... three... That's nice, man! - Can you me take a solo photo of me there?. - Let s go that way. By the way, Thanks for what you did last night. Don't mention it. I just lose my temper whenever I meet such kind of people. Why don t you just admit it? You just want to defend me from those people. You're like a hero from an action movie. You fight for your lead lady character. You're right! Don't you miss your girl friend? Isn?t she supposed to be with you here? l miss her. But she can t be with me on this trip. - Do you love her? - Certainly. How come Xavier said that you keep an account in a gay dating website? l m just curious what is outside of a comfortable and a convenient relationship. - Would you like to try it? - Try what? The relationship that you're talking about Well, l really would not know if l am up to it or if l really want to try it. Then, let s just try the 'sex' part of the relationship. probably, just for the sake of experience. We can try it tonight... - You don t like me, do you? - Hey, you are attractive, man! Don t worry about Xavier and l. We're just having fun. l hope we could have the same kind of fun as well. I?d like to tell you something. You re the only person who would know about this. Even Manuel, does not know anything about this. I am looking for Philip... because personally, he is very important to me. I value him. Because l promised him, that l will see him again. is he your lover? We're friends. Best friends. Tell me the truth! l hope this is the place that we?ve been looking for. Let's go inside. Let s go. Good morning. Is Philip Banaag here? Oh, Philip? - Wait a second, let me call him. - Thank you! Sir Philip! Sir Philip! - Michael Floresca! - Philip Banaag! - How did you know how to get here? - l just found my way! Oh! Here s my cousin Manuel and my friends Aldo and Xavier. - How are you, man? - l m now a father. Busy with work here in the factory. This is the family business of my wife. - Where do you guys stay? - We just came from the town. We re hoping we could stay in a beach resort. You could stay at home. We live near the beach. Oh no! We might be too much of a trouble for your wife and family. - Don t bother. - We can stay in a resort Sir, the room is over there. It?s equipped with fan and hot shower. Just ask me when you need anything. - What's your name again? - l m Erwin. So, we can practically call you for all kinds of needs, is that right? - Quit it! - I?m just kidding! Macky, l have to go back to our place. We should all have something to drink later. -Sure. - And don't buy dinner. My wife and l Will bring you something to eat as well - Thanks, man! - Thanks! - Erwin, be in charge of my guests! - Yes sir. I'll just get their stuff. Hello? Ahhhh... ahhhh... sorry. l m busy. Someone is fucking me. What do you need? Ahhhh... ahhh... Can l just call you again? You seem to be busy. l was just kidding. What do you need? Do you miss me? We haven't had sex for about two months! Are you busy? l need to talk to you? Why do you sound so serious? Are you in love with me? No, l just want to be honest with you. l have a problem. You really sound serious. Go on... - Do you get yourself checked by a doctor? - Why do l need to? l m not sick. This is what happened. My family is about t migrate. We were required by the embassy or a series of checkups. I got positive or HIV. Son of a bitch! is this a joke? You're HIV positive? Xavier, l have already come out to government. My doctor advised me... to inform all those that I have been sexually in contact with... to inform them of their risk status. - Our contact was quite risky. - What do l do if l m also positive? Well. we couldn't be sure with you actual status. Just to be safe. you need to wait or six months... from our last sexual contact before you can get yourself checked. You need to allow a window period before the virus gets detected. That is if you're positive. If you?re negative. then there's nothing to worry about. Men, you?ve got to try this ?dinakdakan? and ?bagnet?. - Who cooked this? - That's the specialty of my wife. - This is the best! - You must be lucky to have such a wife! l m really lucky with her. Such a great cook! - isn?t it too salty? - No. It s just perfect. - How come your eyes look like that? - l overslept. Try this. This was prepared by Anet. Mack y, do you remember during our college days... we used to spend our time drinking at the sunken garden. We drink until the next morning. Until the joggers and the soccer players come. We were crazy. We used to watch couples making love in the garden! That s not possible anymore. Security is stricter. There are a lot of guards roving around. And there are no more sweet couples there. The garden is now filled with gay men cruising around. - Cruising for what? - Gay men cruising... looking for sex. Can l ask you something? Why did you leave the university? - Too bad, I wasn?t able to meet you there. - It?s a long story. We lacked funds. So l just had to study in Laoag. At least, l met my wife there. Am l not lucky? Here are more drinks! Let s see who's up for a second round! Erwin, do you have cigarettes? I can buy you some at the convenience store! Can I come with you at the store? Be fast. Where?s the can opener? Just let Xavier enjoy his night! This is fun! Sir, would you like some special 'service '. - Huh? - I can give you a massage. - And we can do whatever you want. - I?m sorry. I?m not interested. Please sir. l can do it even for just two hundred pesos. l just need the money. l m sorry. I?m not feeling well. Just go to the group. Tell them, I?ll be following. - I?m sorry for being too bold. - That's fine. Don't worry. Hello, I?m sorry about a while ago. l was caught by surprise. - How are you? - That's okay. l understand. I?m okay. I feel perfectly normal. But l have been receiving medicines from San Lazaro every month... to delay the progression of my status into a full blown AIDS. - Sorry. - I?m aiso sorry. I exposed you t it. That's okay. We both wanted it. How did your family react to it? I?m staying with my friend right now. l can't ace them at the moment. - My wife is sleepy. - Not really. l just get to bed early because the kids wake up early for school. When are you leaving? We're planning to leave tomorrow. We don't have much cash. You can stay at home so you don't have to spend on anything. That will be too much trouble for you guys. My friends are noisy. Your kids won t like them! My wife and l should leave now. Thanks for the food. We were stuffed. Aldo, Manuel. We?ll go ahead. Just tell Xavier we went ahead. Good night! Thanks man! Be safe! That s exactly how my face looked like... when my text mate didn?t show up on our first date. l was in love with that person. We were communicating for about three months. But it went to nothing. Tell me the truth. You re in love with Philip. Aren't you? Do you think you can hide what you feel from me? I know you very well, cousin. Yes... before he left the university... we promised each other that we will meet again. - But we lost touch. - So, do you love him? Hey, you're back. My wife told me that l shouldn't have left you guys early. - You are my visitors. - Stay here. - Aldo and l will just look for Xavier. - Aldo seems to be drunk. - He can still get up! - Get up Aldo Just come back if you still want more beer. - Thanks for coming back. - I don t see you that often . Do you want to say something? Nothing. How about you? Do you want to say something? - Nothing really. - Probably... I would have said something before l left Manila. There was something that l wanted to say. But l understand if you can t say it anymore. Things are different now. We know, that we have both changed. if l m positive... I will have to take medicines regularly or I may never get to reach the age of thirty. Don't think that way. You're not even sure if you re positive. But chances are high. Were you not guys into safe sex? I can barely remember. There were probably times that we were safe. There were times when we were not. Don't worry. You still have chances of being negative. I still want to finish my studies. I want to travel. I want to make my own film. I want to see my family. I want to fall in love. - Do you want to be infected as well? - A kiss couldn?t transmit the virus. Why? I love you. Hey Aldo! You re up. Have you guys eaten ? I?m here for Philip. I?m sure you guys were drunk last night. - They're still asleep. - I?ll just wake him up. - Your cottage is right over there, right? - Stay here! Let s eat! Thank you! I?ve had my breakfast. - l need to tell you something... - Let s just wake Philip up. - Drink this juice! - Let's go to your cottage. Fuck... Aldo! That s Anet! Hurry up! - Are you crazy? - l m sorry. l was just drunk! You must be very drunk! This stupid Aldo spilled his juice on my dress! Sorry. That was unintentional. I was just drunk. What the hell is your problem? You did that? Yes. I didn't want you guys caught. Thanks for saving us. It would have been a big scandal in this town. - Congratulations! - For what? - Are you guys on? - No... it was just like a confirmation. At least, after this trip, l can put an end to what l feel. How about you? What's your plan when we get back to Manila? I?ll wait for the call of my new employer. Don't you want to study? I still dream of studying. But I can't afford it. I need to send money to my hometown. And when you work as a sales attendant, you barely have any time to study. You can try the open university. Study during weekends. Work during weekdays. You can try applying in the call center of my aunt. The schedule is more flexible. You?ll find time to study. - But l am not good in speaking in English. - There's a training. - l can help you with it. - That's too much trouble for you. - How was your sleep? - Well, mosquitoes feasted on us. But we didn't mind just so you could have the room all to yourself. That is so sweet! - Here's some gift from Anet. - Thanks! Any share for us? Of course, you guys have. Here s yours... yours... - Thanks man! - You ve got two hundred bucks? You?ve got to pay me though. l barely have any cash. This is a lot. What's the flavor of this? - Thanks for this! - What is that? You have to return that! Give this to me! So l can always remember you with it. Okay. if we see each other again, I want to see that with you! Sure. I won t forget you. So will I. - Macky, have a safe drive. - Thanks Man! - What was the two hundred bucks for? - That was our tip Let?s give it to him. He had a long night because of us! Oh well... Hop in. Oh well... Hop in. Wait a second. Now that we?re leaving, we have to change positions as well. Stay at the back! I?ll stay here. We?ve got a lot of food in here! Macky, I'd like to try the training in your aunt s company. I won t lose anything, right? Don't worry. I?ll ask my aunt to help you out. - Thanks! - Don?t mention it. No one can stop us from enjoying the trip. Should you throw up, just go to sleep. Don't worry. We are with you. Even in you're sleep. we are going to have un. Can you just forget about your problems? Come join our ride. We are leaving We are leaving for a trip around the world. Come join our ride.. We are leaving for a trip around the world. THE END
