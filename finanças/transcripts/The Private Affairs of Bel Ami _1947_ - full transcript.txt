I was just saying to my friend there's a handsome gentleman who'll stand us a grenadine. You will stand us a drink won't you? Yes, from that fountain. George! Don't you know me, Charles Forestier of the Six. I knew you the minute I set eyes on you. You haven't changed I see. Same old Charles. - Come along and have a drink, I'm delighted to see you. - You're the first friendly face I've met in Paris. How are you? - Oh not too well, I've got a bad cough I can't get rid of. What'll you have? Two, doctor told me I should go to south, but it's not so easy, I'm married and I've got a job I can't run out on. What kind of a job? - The one editorialist town, La Vie Francaise. A full fledged journalist if you please. A journalist, sounds important. Just a fancy word for newspaper man. What have you been up to since you left the army? You look prosperous enough. I'm a rich man, I've got enough money to last me the rest of my life. The devil you have. - Providing I don't live beyond tomorrow afternoon. How do you like that? - "Is ignorance desirable in a cabinet minister?" By Charles Forestier. You see, I'm very impressed, you've come a long way from the time we still ate sheep and two chickens from a band of bloodthirsty Arabs. - Don't spear it, I'm scared just to remember it. To the Arabs. God rest their souls. I got pretty sick of the army, but I can't say that Paris has been much better. I seem to have been sent into the world merely to swell the crowd. - You didn't expect to open Paris like an oyster? - But for the last six months I've had a job in the office of the Northern Railway Company at 1,500 francs a year. Dang it that's not much. - Today is the 28th of June, and here's my total capital. Three francs, and forty centime to get me to the end of the month. I can choose between two lunches and no dinner, or two dinners and no lunch. I just did the most foolish thing imaginable, I squandered the price of a breakfast on a toy that is quite inedible. Punch and a stick. What in the world prompted you to buy this? - It occurred to me that I have need of a start stick like that of punch to beat my way. When I see the idiots with money in their pockets And I'm tempted to wring their necks like we used to do with the chickens on the. That is a bad cough you've got. I shouldn't have taken that shiroot. How is it you couldn't get a better job in that clerk's prison than. - All the writing masters place at. - Well you can't do that, people in society won't receive you after you've given their children running lessons. One grenadine. You make yourself at home. It's your friend who interests me. I think I could make a fool of myself at his sake. - I'm glad to see you haven't changed George. It always used to annoy me the way women went for you. You suppose it's that devilish look you've got? - It may be, I've noticed that women take to men who have the appearance of wickedness. - Haven't I seen you in the. It's possible. My name's Rachel Michot, my friend and I are dancers, we don't go on until 11 and we're often in the promenade between nine and 10. Perhaps we'll encounter your good looking friend there. And perhaps you will not, now swallow your stolen drink and be on your way. Quickly. You're very successful with women. You must look after that, it might lead to something. In Paris, quickly. A stick like that of punch. What's that? - Oh nothing, just an idea that occurred to me. - Look here, how would you like to try journalism? There's a vacancy at La Vie Francaise. One of our reporters has got himself killed in a duel. - But you know I've never written anything. Everyone must begin, I can get you a job information forum, make calls and inquires. Should I speak to the manager about it? By all means. Come and dine with me tomorrow. The boss, Monsieur Walter will be there, and with luck, we might put it over. I haven't any dressed clothes. A parisher might as well go naked. Here's 100 francs, you'll pay me when you can. When you dress suit, dine with me tomorrow, half past seven. and my wife will expect you. 17. Well I'll have another drink and read your article. Till tomorrow then. Till tomorrow, thanks old man. Long live the six. Good evening Clotilde. Good evening Madeleine. And you are Georges Duroy. Are you two already acquainted? Monsieur Georges Duroy, an old friend of Charles. Madame Clotilde de Marelle, my very dear friend. Madame. We met quite by chance at your door. Fate perhaps had a hand in it. - It's Norbert de Varenne, the blind composer, and his wife Marie. You may have heard him at Notre Dame Cathedral, he's organist there, he writes about music with La Vie Francaise. And who is that beside Charles? - Laroche Mathieu, he's a member of the Chamber of Deputies and political editor of the paper. Everyone says he will be a cabinet minister. And the gentleman with the cigar is Monsieur Walter? You'll never see him without one, banker and publisher. The woman knitting is his wife, she's always knitting. The pretty girl at the window is their daughter, Suzanne. - And Madame Walter knits to fast, there's some trouble locked up in her. Perhaps. Who's the artist? - Jacques Rival, you've seen his caricatures. He's very witty, you'll like him. Don't you think it is absurd monsieur? I'm not allowed to go to the theater, except to the classics, I'm forbidden to read the serials in papa's newspaper. I skip crime stories, I am allowed to paint in watercolors but not in oils, and then I can only paint roses. Parents think they can keep their daughter sealed up like, like a letter, while we bloat into the world to imitate our grandmothers to feed canaries and fill in embroidery patterns. After all I'm 15 years old, and this is the year 1880. You must excuse my daughter monsieur, she chatters like that from the moment she gets up in the morning. - If I published a newspaper fit for my daughter to read, I'd be out of business in two weeks. - She's old enough in my opinion to read anything, we censor our young people too much. There's only one way to develop an immunity to the diseases of life, and that's to be exposed to them. What a dangerous theory. - It is not only the young people who suffer from too much censorship, here am I a widow with a four year old daughter, what I would like to do more than anything, is disguise myself as a house maid on the, and dance at the Reine Blanche. But not a single of gentleman of my acquaintances are willing to take me there. And they're perfectly right. Monsieur Varenne. It is Monsieur Duroy who is speaking. - I believe I saw you and your wife at the Puppet Theater on the yesterday. Yes I like that puppet show because one can still find punch there, I think there's a lesson to be learned from him. What lesson is to be learned from punch, except bad manners? He beats everyone who opposes him, but his brutality is not his own, it is imposed on him. And what I have thought is this, those who surrender themselves to evil are no longer free souls, they are marionettes of the devil. We are all no more than puppets, unless we believe in God. - A profound observation, don't tell me we're going to discuss the question of God, and the soul of the soup, that subject doesn't usually come up until the dessert. - By that time, no one knows what he's talking about, but I believe I'm quite as religious as you are Norbert. I pray every morning for the stock market to go up. - Why do you think that punch has been so popular for a period of centuries, it is because he's a scoundrel. The human race, it does is counter, and always crucifies its heroes. What is your opinion of punch, monsieur? - I have respect for him, I do not think it is easy to be a successful scoundrel. - You're right, it takes talent. - But I think what strikes me most about punch is his amorous inclination. Disgusting. - I find it delightful, please go on monsieur. You've arrived at a subject which interests me. - Love is a subject which always interests women. Perhaps because in discussing it, one passes so readily from the general to the particular. - Will make a caricature of you as punch, since you admire him so much. Thank you monsieur. - Your wife tells me that you have something very important to talk to me about Charles. Does it concern the paper? - It does, but I imagine it can wait until dinner's over. - Nonsense, we are all from the paper, with exception of Monsieur Duroy, but he'll not be offended by a little shop talk. - It concerns Monsieur Duroy, you'll forgive me Georges if I speak before everyone. Of course. - We all remember poor Mirambeau who was killed in a duel. - I would have rather have lost 20,000 francs. Duelists are no better than murderers, and they ought to be punished as such. We need someone to replace Mirambeau, and I'd like to engage my friend. Are you a journalist monsieur? Charles had the idea to make me one. Georges has just returned from Africa, where he served in all three provinces. He has an original turn of mind, and I had the idea that he could do a series of articles on Algeria, while the subject is being debated in the chamber. Recollections of a, I think I shall like to read that. Bring me an article tomorrow at three, and we'll decide the matter. Charles! - Georges, what on Earth are you doing here? Waiting for you to come out. I didn't want to go up, for fear of disturbing you, I need your help. - Are you checking up on your competitors already? - I've given myself an overnight course in journalism. I see, you mean you haven't been able to write your article. - I've been at it all night, I haven't slept a wink. I've made all sorts of notes, but I can't seem to get them into shape. I've tore up all my attempts. I'm in a bit of a hurry this morning. - If you could just take 10 minutes to get me started. I've got to make a good impression on Monsieur Walter, or I'm afraid the whole thing will be off. As far as I can see, you've got some pretty good ideas here. I can't seem to organize them properly. - Go and see my wife, she'll be able to help you just as well as I can. Your wife? I trained her for this kind of work. - I can't call her at this time of the morning. She's up, you'll find her in my study, arranging some notes for me. You're not going to make me climb those stairs again I hope? - I'll tell her that you forced me positively forced me to come to see her. - Bring the article to me at the La Vie Francaise. Don't worry about that. - And that monsieur, is how one writes an article. Sign it if you please. I haven't the words to thank you. Nonsense, I made the sauce, but you provided the materials. Excellent materials. But sign it. Georges Duroy. I hope you're not suffocating. I simply can't work without smoking. What is it you want to say? You won't be offended? Is it so awful? - When I saw you last night, I couldn't help thinking what a lucky devil Charles is, she's beautiful. - No woman could be offended by such a confession. - Now I can't help thinking what a lucky devil Charles is, she's clever. - Tell me, what did you think of my friend Clotilde Marelle? - She's so young, one could never imagine her to be a widow. - She was married to a man much older than herself. You have no idea how original and intelligent she is. You must go and call on her one of these days. - She wanted so much to go to the Reine Blanche, do you think I dare take her there? Not the Reine Blanche. Oh Bernard, how nice to see you. Madeleine. - I must introduce an old friend of Charles, Monsieur Georges Duroy, our best and closest friend the Count de Vaudrec. - Monsieur. - Monsieur. Well thank you again. I've had such good fun. There's been many such evenings. At carnival time, I want to dress up, not as a house maid again, but as a young man in a full-dressed suit, you have no idea what a charming young man I can be. Haven't I? I've never seen that La Vie Francaise has other uses than spreading the news. - I heard Monsieur Walter talking about you the other day. What did he say? - He says that you're a real find for the paper. He thinks you'll get on. I find journalism very much to my taste. What I've soon to discover is how one makes money at it? Who is the Count de Vaudrec? - He is Madeleine Forestier's oldest friend. Oh. - I don't think so, he dines with her and Charles twice every week, he's very rich. His name is amongst the noblest in France. Madeleine is very clever. I wish I were clever. You're clever enough to be beautiful, and I know no cleverness to match that. - She is keen, clever, and intriguing as no one else is. She'd be a treasure for anybody who wants to get on. - She has a curious habit of moving her wedding ring up and down on her fingers if she didn't consider it very permanent, Charles frightens me sometimes with that cough of his, will she marry again, do you suppose if anything happens to him? - Oh I suspect that she has someone in her eye. The deputy perhaps. Not Laroche Mathieu. - Everyone says he'll be a cabinet minister. Madeleine is very ambitious. She's far too good for that mediocrity. Are you in love with Madeleine? Certainly not. Are you in love with anyone? Yes. Liar. I've had too much champagne. Is she asleep Louise? Like an angel madame. What do you think of my daughter? Isn't she an angel? She's as adorable as her mother, and more intelligent. How do you know that? The soldier she has in her arms is wearing the uniform of the Sixth. My old regiment. What a wicked man you are, I think I shall call you Bel Ami. - It's a name I shall do my best to deserve. I've just taken a charming apartment near the Cathedral of Notre Dame. Will you take coffee with me there tomorrow afternoon? No. Good. - Will you take coffee with me tomorrow afternoon? No. Tomorrow afternoon. - He wrote it for me mommy, for my birthday. I love you so much. Two grenadine. Good evening monsieur. You know that woman? No, I've never saw her in my life. They can be awfully bold sometimes, these women. Cognac. He cut me dead, the swine. He knew me well enough to have a drink with me last Thursday night, and the Thursday before that, and the Thursday before that. He can have all the fancy ladies he likes, but he can at least bow to me. I'll teach him manners, the lout! Good evening Georges. Good evening, are you quite well? What have you grown deaf since Thursday? So you're dumb then, perhaps the young lady's bitten your tongue off. What do you mean by speaking to me? Get out, or I'll have you locked up. So that's it is it you lout! The least you could do is nod to me! There's no reason because you're with somebody else you had to cut me today! You only nodded to me when I met you just now, and I should have left you alone, but you wanted to do the grand, well okay, so you won't say good evening when you meet me, stop her she stole my sweetheart! When we first met, you said it was not chance, but fate that had brought us together. I know now that it was a fatality as inescapable as daybreak and as mysterious as the rising of the moon. You went at my heart through the door of my eyes. And I gladly made a place for you there. Now it seems as natural for me to love you as to breathe, what have I to reproach you with? But you have made me love you more than you love me, but in love, there is always one that loves more than the other. One cannot tear love from the heart as one extracts a tooth, I love you so much that your cruelty is dearer to me than the love of others. I love you so much that there is nothing you could do that I would not be willing to forgive. Tonight, my emotions overcame me. Of that, I ask forgiveness. Hereafter I shall hide from you the terrible jealously that kindles in my heart. If I must weep, I shall hold a curtain between you and my tears. I shall make you a thousand secret sacrifices, including the sacrifice of myself love. It is not difficult to make the gift of love, but there is a greater gift, the gift of pride, I give you my pride dear Bel Ami. Together with my love, which will never change. - I think you can touch old man Walter for a raise starting tomorrow since you have to take over some of my duties. Don't tell me you're leaving at last. Tomorrow, I'm going to Cannes. The doctor's imperative orders. About time you took care of yourself. I should have been off a month ago. What fools we are, we squander our lives as though we were immortal. What kind of talk do you call that? It would be odd wouldn't it, when I brought you here, I'm training my successor. - Nonsense, all you need is a little sunshine, and you'll be fit as ever. Perhaps. - Just when I'm leaving Paris, you decide to visit me. You prefer Clotilde, you find time to visit her. Or perhaps you've quarreled with her, is that it? Last night, Clotilde was angry with me, but you know Clotilde, today we're friends again. I haven't come to visit you, it's because it's better so. What do you mean by that? I'm in love with you, only a little, but I don't want to be head over ears. You could have come all the same. No man is in love with me long. Why not? - Because it's useless, I let you understand that at once. A man in love is not only idiotic, but dangerous. He's like a mad dog, which may have a fit of biting. I cease all relations with people who are in love with me. Pretend to be, until their illness is over. But can we command our feelings? Look at me. I assure you that it is absolutely useless for you to persist in this sentiment, and now that the operation is over, will you agree to be friends? Good friends, and nothing more? - I agree, if I had found a woman like you, how gladly I would have married her. Can you reach that suitcase for me? Of course. - I shall play the part of a friend at once. May I speak plainly? Please do. - Go and see Madame Walter and do your best to please her. I know that you still hold an inferior position on the paper, and you're not paid enough money for your needs. Be attentive to Madame Walter, it'll help you get on. How clever you are. - I want to prove that I can be your friend. Can I tell you an idea I've had? An original idea for the paper. Yes of course. I thought I might try a daily column made up of gossip and rumor. Yes. I should call it, Echoes. Echoes, I like that. - I should hint at things, without stating them plainly. Insinuate what can neither be proved or disproved. Make indiscreet revelations, contradict in such a way as to confirm. But this is superb. Everyone must be thought of. All classes, all professions, Paris and the provinces. The army and the art world, the university and the people are so full of menace, they're always ready to believe gossip, reputations could be strengthened or weakened, created or destroyed. And La Vie Francaise could become a power to be feared and courted. It will be necessary to be far-seeing, cunning, to judge what is good to announce, and good to hide. One can influence the stock market. The selection of cabinet ministers. But Monsieur Walter will be mad about your idea. You think so? It's magnificent, I wish I could help you with your Echoes. - I wish you could, remember our agreement, we're friends now, you have need of me no matter what. Do not hesitate. Thank you, I won't forget. Frankly of use, you're going to send a letter or telegram, and I will obey. Goodbye Madeleine. Goodbye Bel Ami, we've all picked up Clotilde's nickname for you. Why Bernard, how nice of you to come and bid me goodbye. Madeleine. You remember Monsieur Duroy. - Monsieur. - Monseiur. I'll take these pears. Georges Duroy begs Madame Walter to accept a few pears when she received this morning from Normandy. It was so good of you to send us the delicious pears from Normandy. They came from a famous orchard. Quite close to my old home. Sometimes my daughter's actions are a little bewildering. - Georges, you have come at the right moment. We are discussing a subject on which we need your expert opinion, comparison has been made between the measurements of the and those considered ideal in the female form today. - I confess a preference for the living woman. Bravo! - When you are my age, you may prefer the statue. - I was sure that Bel Ami would be our champion. - On behalf of French women, I thank you monsieur. - A woman possesses an obvious advantage over a statue. She turns herself in the direction you desire, while with a statue you have to walk around it to get the right point of view, and that is tiring. Bravo. - On behalf a French woman, I withdraw my thanks. - I still prefer the statue, the statue at least will never deceive you. - Human society could hardly exist without deception. But you are too severe, in my opinion there are good women. Well. There may be in some corner, young, pretty, and good women who exist since the world doesn't even suspect. No woman is worth what she costs! Even if she costs nothing. - Is there no one here to defend us, monsieur? You need no defense, madame. But I shall not remain and hear your virtue, and your charm reduced. If you'll excuse me madame. So soon? - I'm afraid so, whenever Monsieur Duroy appears, the conversation takes an unwholesome turn. I find myself welcome at many gatherings for no better reason than that my arrival is the signal for Monsieur Forestier's departure. We are waiting monsieur for your devastating reply. No doubt he'll think of it in the cab. You are wicked monsieur to bait him so. It is he who invariably provokes it. Besides, I disapprove of hypocrisy in other people. I've been admiring your paintings Monsieur Walter. Now is the time to buy, the painters are all dying of hunger. They've not the suit. Not one suit. - I must get home, my daughter will be angry with me. And my escort you to your door? I shall be delighted. Suzanne. I saw a young girl run up the stairs, and now a young lady comes down. It's nothing less than magic. - I suppose she's a little too big for spanking. Past my 16th birthday, Monsieur Bel Ami. Do you approve of me? - My daughter finds you irresistible monsieur. - Now look at me, I want to see if you still care for me. I have a letter here that I want you to read. Read it. - He never gives up does he oh Gaston Rival. It's not myself I'm thinking of. Monsieur Rival is wealthy, he's one of the most respected citizens of, he's a good man. Devoted and honorable, if I marry him, whatever may happen to me, Laurine's future will be assured. Well then. Ought I to marry him? By all means. - You know very well I have no intention of marrying him. Well then there's no problem. - Don't you understand it's you I want to marry? You cannot deny that you love me. - Marriage and love are two entirely different subjects. I don't think so, a true marriage is a daily bread of the heart. There's no greater happiness. There's no money in happiness. - If one desires money and success too much, it can poison his life, give me a cigarette case. Have you never thought that one day you'll grow old, you will stretch out your arms for love, and consolation, but no one will come? Then there are children, wouldn't you like children of your own? Like little Laurine who is so fond of you. What is it then that you want in life? Shall I tell you? I shall like to know. When you marry, you want it to be in the Church of the Madeleine, with all the wealth and fame of Paris in attendance. You want to look from the church, across the Place de la Concorde to the Chamber of Deputies where your future lies. - You cannot possibly understand what Paris means to those who grew up as I did in the provinces. We looked toward Paris as the souls in purgatory that look toward paradise, it's a war in which I'm engaged. One man against a great city. I must conquer Paris or be conquered. - Perhaps you could fight even better with me beside you. Perhaps. Fits perfectly. I had it made to the exact measurement. I can take the measure of your cigarette case and put my photograph in it, so that when we are not together, you will be reminded of me. By what arithmetic am I to measure you? Who will tell me the dimensions of the heart? - I could be happy with you Clotilde, I know that. Well then. Number 18, monsieur. My heart tells me that you're right. But I haven't listened to my heart for a long time. Do listen to it now, Bel Ami. - I am writing you this letter, because you told me I could count on you always. Will you come and help me during the last moments of my husband, who is dying. I could only ask such a service of you, as Charles has no relatives, you were his comrade, he opened the door of the paper to you. Come I beseat you, I have no one else to ask. I came just as quickly as I could. How is he? The priest is with him now. He's so far gone? You'll scarcely recognize him. - I can hear all the bugle calls from the encampment. You can see the warships in the bay. Look through my glasses there, you can make out the squadron. There's the Colbert and. The Admiral du Peret. It's beautiful isn't it? And over there is Africa. Sounds familiar doesn't it? They're always passing here. Do you remember how we rolled in Georges? You and I and this old accordion. The sun will be shining, and Spring time will be in the sky. Carriages will be passing in the street. And breeze will blow the curtain. But I, Charles Forestier will be here no more. Just as though I had never existed. You're not so bad as all that. I can see death so near I want to reach out my arms, push it back. Madeleine. - How clear the night is, it's almost as bright as day. - Over there in Africa, when we were soldiers together, Charles risked his life every day, and no harm came to him. I think a cigarette might help me. Would it be wrong to smoke? I don't think so. I must ask you to listen to me for a moment. Try to understand what I want to tell you, and do not be indignant of my speaking of such a matter at such a moment, for you may have made some decision about your future before I have an opportunity to see you in Paris, I think you must be aware of the feeling I have for you. When we wrote my first article together, when we talked about my Echoes, I had the vision of a life that brought work and sentiment together in a rare, and happy collaboration, I have dared to hope that such a prospect might be pleasing to you also. It is not a proposal I'm making to you, the time and place would render that odious, I only wish you to know that you could make me happy with a word, my heart, and my self are yours. Have I offended you? No. I do not wish you to go away without an answer. But I'm not prepared to say yes or no. I too, have felt that our collaboration could be a happy one but it's necessary that you should understand what sort of woman I am. Marriage for me is not a charm, but a partnership, I must be free, perfectly free as to my ways, my acts, my comings and goings, I must be an equal, an ally, not an inferior. Or an obedient and submissive wife. My notions are not those of everyone. But I shall not change them, you must consider all this carefully. I do not wish you to change. It is as you are that I've come to love you. You're quite sure that you're free to make me this proposal? You have no other attachments? I have no attachments. We think that love is given to us, it is not, it is sold to us at the cost of the most cruel tortures. Do you remember saying to me that Madeleine would be a treasure for anyone who wanted to get on? You said that the first night we went to the Reine Blanche. When will you be married? We shall go next week, where my father lives, and be married in the registry office Madeleine didn't want a church wedding. There will be no witnesses except my father, and Madeleine's friend, the Count Vaudrec. I'm glad you're home early, I've had some important news from Morocco. I got it from. We must work up an important article at once. - I think I know your news, it will be more than an article, it'll be a campaign against the ministry, and will end by making that idiot Laroche Mathieu the minister of foreign affairs. And that idiot Laroche Mathieu will end by making our fortune. Nevertheless, I'd be glad if our efforts were for someone less stupid. - Your ears should have been burning this afternoon. Madame Walter is quite smitten with you. Nonsense. - I tell you it so, she spoke of you with wild enthusiasm. She'd like to find a husband like you for her daughter. And from my observation, the daughter would be quite willing. - The daughter's father would be quite unwilling. You imagine old Walter accepting me as a suitor? Oh she's aiming very high, nothing less than a count or a marquee for Suzanne. Or at the very least, a baron. - The title that I hold will present no great difficulty. How so? There are ways of acquiring a title. Sure there are. - For example, the noblest names in France were available to anyone if a family's died out. All that's necessary is a visit to the Keeper of the Seals, and an advertisement in the official journal. Any protest must be made in writing within one year from this date. In case someone born with the title is hidden away somewhere, he has one year in which to make himself known, and enter his objection, after that, it's too late. - Have you been considering something of this sort? The time has not come for that yet. So she fancied me, Madame Walter? - If it were anyone else I should be quite alarmed, but fortunately with Madame Walter, such things are of no moment. How of no moment? - Madame Walter has never had even the slightest whisper about her, she's so perfect that sometimes I want to throw her out of the window. - All angels become women again sooner or later. Would you put an idea into my head, I might learn something from her about old Walter's schemes. We have more important things to talk about than Madame Walter. Forestier. I beg your pardon, Duroy it's you I want to speak to. It's stupid of me, but I'm always mixing you up with poor Charles Forestier. It's because your articles are so infernally like his. I suppose. Put that gentleman here, will you? There are all sorts of fools and envious people in this world. Yes I see that I was right, the resemblance is remarkable. Lend me a piece of your chalk Jacques. Certain individuals here thought it funny after some time passed to call me Forestier. I begin to find it very stupid. However, I have a peaceful nature, and I wish to prevent matters from growing to painful extremes. It's true that I'm no longer a member of the Sixth, but I think you'll find out I've not lost my skill with firearms. I wish it to be known, that I will slap the face of the first person who makes the mistake of calling me Forestier again. It is for Monsieur Laroche Mathieu to decide whether his little joke is worth risking a bullet for. You will need yellow for your next caricature of Laroche Mathieu. How have you been doing? A century has passed since our last meeting. Quite well, and you Bel Ami? You will allow me to call him Bel Ami still? I will allow whatever you please. Then perhaps you will permit him to escort me to my carriage. Good bye Madeleine, thank you. Good bye Clotilde. How do you like your new life? Not much, one way or the another. We are, as you see, a magnificent success. We've overthrown the cabinet. We made Laroche Mathieu Minister of Foreign Affairs. I'm a journalistic celebrity, and my wife presides over the most distinguished political salon in Paris. It has turned out to be a practical partnership. Nothing more? Nothing more. Wait. Remember this? Why should you want me to see Madeleine's picture in this cigarette case? Look under Madeleine's picture. You see how it is? You haven't changed then. Not for a moment, and you? As if I could ever stop loving you. You will visit us again? - My carriage doesn't seem to have come as of yet. - That is my good fortune, I shall have a moment with you. Why do you look at me so strangely? - I want always to remember this time, this place, the trees, the darkening street, this moment like an island in the great stream of time. What on Earth are you talking about? Can't you guess? - No, what is it that makes this moment so important? I've arrived at a great decision. If you will look the other way, I will tell you what it is. Regardless of convention, or what you may think of me, I shall declare myself. To me. To you. You must be mad. - I'm sure of it, but I'm glad I've spoken, and I've wanted to say this for a very long time, but I dare not, they say you're so strict, so proper. - I'm afraid that I shall remember this moment also. Then you're not offended? No. You understand my feeling? I understand it. You'll return it, you do not deny it? When shall I see you? I dare not see you. I must see you. It's impossible. - Meet me tomorrow afternoon in Le Parc Marceau. We encounter each other as if by chance in a public garden, what could be more proper? - I shall be at the Cathedral of Notre Dame tomorrow afternoon at half past three. - I have lighted a fire in an old, soot-filled chimney. Madame de Varenne, you are surprised to see me here, but do not be alarmed, I'm not a reformed character. If you're quite sure of that. May I ask you something? I've been puzzled about you ever since I first saw you with your husband. You are somehow not like other women. What are other women like, monsieur? - Usually women strike me as being incredibly stupid. They can be caught by a look, a smile, a complement, anything that touches their vanity. It is impossible not to despise them. But you are different. I understood it once that you were not to be taken in by such devices. - Why should you wish to take me in at all? I could not help you to gain money or position. You do me an injustice. Wait, why do you smile? Because you're ridiculous. - Is it ridiculous to wonder why a woman like you should marry a man who cannot even see that she is beautiful? I confess it seems unnatural to me. What made you waste your beauty on a man who is blind? - How is one to explain such a thing to a man like you? Try. I admire his mind and I love his soul. There's a quality in him you could never comprehend. What is that quality? - A kind of grace that comes from being gentle and good. And faith that endures in spite of men and of experience. If he should die, surely you will find someone else to adore, one moment more. What do you think of me, really? I think you're contemptible. Shall I tell you what I think of you? It has no interest upon me. I think you're probably the only really good woman I've ever known. - I'm sorry for you monsieur there are millions of us. Bel Ami. Yes sir. You've hardly spoken a word to me. How can you be so cold, so cruel. Have you forgotten our understanding? We were carried away by our emotions. We've been guilty of an unpardonable betrayal. But we made a solemn agreement to atone for it by burying our feelings in our heart. - But I must at least see you, I cannot live unless I see you. - We meet socially two or three times a week. We see each other then do we not? Does that satisfy you? We agreed that anything more would be neither honorable or discreet. But I have been discreet, I am sure that no one can suspect anything. - You call it discreet to summon me at all hours to hasty meeting in street corners and shops, and public gardens. It is only to see you for a moment. It's discreet to write me letters full of pet names and wait for me in a cab with the blinds drawn at the door of my office. Lying, waiting for me outside my house. You're right, a kind of madness. And now this telegram. "Must see you today, most important. "Meet me at two o'clock, "can render you a great service, yours 'till death." I've been waiting for you to tell me what it is that is so important. - But it is quite true, I came to tell you some news to put you in the way of gaining 50,000 francs or even more. How so? I caught by chance yesterday evening, some words between my husband and Laroche Mathieu. They agreed not to let you into their secret. What secret? - They are going to take possession of Morocco. Nonsense, I've been writing a series of articles for Laroche Mathieu designed to create the exact opposite impression. They are humbugging you in order that their plan might not be known. What is their plan? - They are using your articles to depress the stock market, but secretly and little by little, they've been buying up the whole of the Morocco loan. Now the expedition is to take place, and as soon as we are there, the government will guarantee the debt, they will gain 50 or 60 million. What scoundrels, I do the dirty work, and they leave me out of it. - Monsieur Walter is not a man, he's a cash box. We ought though to profit by this. You can still buy some of the loan, it's only at 72 francs. I haven't any money. - If you love me, then you'd let me lend you some. I can't do that. But you don't need to even borrow it. I will invest 20,000 francs, and you shall stand in for half I will do it entirely with my own money. Walter will know nothing about it. If it succeeds, you will gain 70,000 francs, if not you will owe me 10,000, which you can pay when you please. I don't like such arrangements. - Well it is you who carried on the editorial campaign which has made this scheme possible. It would be foolish not to profit from it. You will render them services worth a great deal more than that. - Very well, but it is understood that if we lose, I will repay you the 10,000 francs. - Eat your dessert before it is completely cold. And I shall tell you about a dream I had of you last night. I was traveling in a train at night, through a mysterious forest, it was a very long train, but I seemed to be the only passenger. We stopped at a deserted station surrounded by dark trees, I hurried to close my suitcase, and stepped down to the platform looking about for you, because I knew you would be there to meet me. - I can't get that swine Laroche Mathieu out of my mind. I could skin him alive for his treachery. - I dreamed that we were taking a journey together across the desert, we were riding on two camels, and we'd taken some sandwiches and a piece of paper, and some wine in a bottle. But it annoyed me because we were too far off from each other on our separate camels. And I wanted to get down. I want to get down too. - You brought with you one of Madeleine's hairs. No it isn't Madeleine's, it's too dark. It may likely one of the maids. You've been with a woman who has wound her hair around all your coat pockets. Oh don't be ridiculous. - She loves you, and she wanted you to take away something belonging to her. You're being very silly. You threw me over to marry Madeleine, and now you're not even faithful to her. - I tell you I don't know anything about it. - You could have a ring made out of her hair if you like, and all the others, I'm sure you know enough of them. Wait. I love you so much that your cruelty is dearer to me than the love of others. I love you so much that there's nothing you could do that I would not be willing to forgive. Hereafter I shall hide from you a terrible jealousy that kindles in my heart. If I must weep, I shall hold a curtain between you and my tears, I shall make you a thousand secret sacrifices, including the sacrifice of myself love. I give you my pride, dear Bel Ami, together with my love, which will never change. I suppose you meant those words at the time you wrote them. What a brute you are. - Well that minister of yours Laroche Mathieu has certainly let us down nicely. - He's no more my minister than he is yours. He doesn't pay court to me. Or to me either. - If I had to make a choice among your admirers I'd still prefer that old fossil to Vaudrec. What has become of the count? I haven't seen him for weeks. - That old fossil de Vaudrec died an hour ago. De Vaudrec? He had a heart attack last night, they sent for me this morning. I just come from his death bed. - Having no direct heirs, I leave the whole of my fortune consisting of stock to the amount of 600,000 francs, amended property worth about 500,000 francs to Madame Claire Madeleine Duroy without any charge or condition. Tis of course understood monsieur, that under the law your wife cannot accept this legacy without your consent. I must ask time to reflect. Just what was the Count de Vaudrec to you? He knew me from my childhood, and my parents before me, he was like a father to me. You seem more affected by his death, then by that of your husband. Charles was ill for a very long. In his case I was prepared. But de Vaudrec died so suddenly. Still, when a man leaves the whole of his fortune to a woman, it cannot be ignored. It, well it requires some explanation. He left his fortune to me because he had no close relatives to leave it to. He was very fond of me, there was nothing more, never. I'm prepared to believe you, but when this legacy is announced, you suppose anyone else will? All the world will gossip about it, and laugh at me, I cannot accept such a situation. Well then let us not accept it. It will be a million less in our pockets, that is all. Perhaps you're right. I have the solution, we'll say that he divided the money between us, leaving half to the husband, and half to the wife. I don't see how that can be done, since the will is. - Very simple, you will sign half the inheritance to me by a deed of gift, in that way, we stop all scandal. - But the will is there, signed by de Vaudrec. - Well have we a need to show it, to paste it on the walls? We'll simply say that the Count de Vaudrec left his fortune between us, that is all! Very well if that is what you wish. - We inherit it from a friend, who leaves his fortune equally to us in order to show that his feeling was purely platonic, if de Vaudrec had thought of it that is what he would have done. No doubt, if I were you, I should go to the notary at once. You think so? By all means. Behold a millionaire. Have you the invitation? Monsieur and Madame Walter beg you to honor them with your company on December the 30th between nine and 12 pm to view the painting by Karl Markovich, the temptation illuminated by electric lights. Electric Lights. - I have to say it was a clever idea of his, that painting. All the critics have judged it to be the masterpiece of the century. Everybody knows Walter paid 400,000 francs for it. You will see all the titled hypocrites using that excuse to enter the home of the. - And to see his daughter who is the heiress of 40 million who is pretty besides, to become one of the kings of the Earth. Oh Suzanne has already had two offers. One from a marquis and one from a count. The place will be infested tonight with counts and marquises. I don't understand why you're so bitter. You haven't set foot in the Walter house for two months. Madame Walter has complained to me about it most critically. - It isn't Madame Walter who keeps me away. Monsieur Walter and that pet dog of his, Laroche Mathieu and played us a scurvy trick. They must have cleaned up 50 million between them. What do we get out of it? Not a red cent. Why make Madame Walter suffer? There's no reason to be cruel to her. - There's the best of reasons, she bores me. - We're so happy that you were able to come. You will find the painting in the small drawing room beyond the conservatory. I hope you will be able to stay for the dance. - I congratulate you Virginia, I don't believe I have ever seen so many celebrities together all at once. I must speak to Laroche Mathieu, his defense of the African campaign. Who's the young man with Suzanne? The Marquis of. - An impoverished fishing for 40 millions. Here you are at last Bel Ami. I'm very angry with you, why do we never see you anymore? I've been very busy. Well it is wicked of you to neglect us. We adore you mama and I. When you're not here, I'm bored to death. Come along now, we'll take you to see our painting of Saint Anthony. It's way at the end beyond the conservatory. Yes. You know when he said that, my mother did the most fantastic thing. She kissed his hand, the painting seems to have cast a spell on her, she says that no one can understand the same struggle with temptation as she can, can you imagine that for my mother, who never had a temptation in her life? She adores the painting, she spends hours here alone, just sitting and looking at it. You're not listening to me at all. Your thoughts are miles away from here. What is it you're thinking of? I've just decided to embark on a daring, and dangerous adventure. May I come along? Yes, if you have the courage, it will take a great deal of courage. I have a surprise for you. What is it? Guess. I shall make no such effort. - The day after tomorrow is the first of January. Yes. It is the time for New Years gifts. Yes. Here's one for you from Laroche Mathieu. He gave it to me tonight at the reception. A cross of The Legion of Honor. It's a big thing at your age. I still preferred 10 million, as that didn't cost too much. - You're incredible, nothing satisfies you anymore. - He's only paying his debt, he still owes me a great deal. You mind if I make a suggestion? What is it? I have an idea that Laroche Mathieu is very much taken with you. Nonsense. Well call it what you like, but I think we ought to take advantage of his interest, so that he doesn't fool us again. What do you suggest? - Encourage him, yield him no favors, mind you, but lead him on so he confides his schemes in you. And that way we will be sure he won't play any more tricks on us. And have you no fear of me? To trust me so far? I trust you. I did not know that you were acting against the Minister of Foreign Affairs. He won't be for that much longer. - What a man to destroy a great in such a way. What a waste. My wife how did she receive you? She denied any wrongdoing, and stated that the rendezvous was made at your suggestion. What a fantastic idea. Yes it is fantastic. - I'll have to try to tell that to the divorce court. I shall get monsieur whenever you have need of me. You're even cleverer and more dangerous than I had supposed, and when you have your freedom, whom will you marry? A princess perhaps, or a bankers daughter? Not Suzanne Walter. You will be disappointed there. Her father needs a better name than Georges Duroy to match his millions. But I remember now, you told me once how one attains a title. Good evening your excellency, perhaps you and my wife will join me in a nightcap. And to think that you wear on your coat the cross of honor that I gave you. You were paying a debt that you made the mistake of not paying it in full, so I collected in my own way. What do you propose to do? - My application for divorce will be filed tomorrow morning, naming the minister of foreign affairs. Tonight I shall write an article for La Vie Francaise which will turn out the candidate who tumbled forever from your political pedestal. You'll discover that I am not without resources. Do not underestimate the extent of your ruin. Your stolen money will not help you, you're done for permanently. - There's still Monsieur Walter, do you suppose? Monsieur Walter is a realist, he wastes no time on lost causes, he will ask and receive your resignation from La Vie Francaise tomorrow. - There's no doubt of that, but you will fight the case since we are innocent. - I shall not fight it, I shall not allow your name or mine to be subjected publicly to his degrading accusations. Well I applaud your discretion. I shall offer myself as a candidate in the October elections From your obscurity, you will be able to follow my career. I should get on. Yes, you will get on. You are an unmitigated cad. But one day you'll make a mistake. Scoundrels like you end by falling into their own traps. Good bye Madeleine. Good bye, Bel Ami. I should like to be announced. Monsieur Duroy. - Why have you become so formal all of a sudden? You are after all quite at home here. You are not accustomed to having yourself announced. I didn't come here tonight just to eat your delicious brandied cherries. My visit is a formal purpose. You sound very dramatic. - This is perhaps the most important moment of my life. I want to read to you a notice I had inserted in the official newspaper six months ago. Apparently this escaped your attention at the time. Monsieur Georges Duroy is about to apply to The Keeper of the Seals for permission to add to his name that of de Cantel. And will hence forth be known as Georges Duroy de Cantel. Any protest must be made in writing to the Keeper of the Seals within one year from this date. Georges Duroy de Cantel, I like that, that's very clever of you. - De Cantel is one of the oldest, noblest names in France, and I've been told that the family has completely died out and since no protest has yet been entered, one may assume that in six months more, the name will legally be mine. - With that name, you are to make a brilliant marriage. It will enable me in any case to follow the impulse of my heart. The name I can now offer is nobler and more ancient than that of the Marquis. And in six months, it will be just as much mine as that is his. - De Marquis, what does he to do with it? When it belongs to your grandchildren, no one will ever dream of questioning their right to it. My grandchildren? - It's true father, I love Bel Ami, and I want to marry him. He's free to marry me, he wanted a noble name and he's acquired that too. You're always singing his praises. Why should you want to stand in the way of our happiness? - And all of this is common sense monsieur. - It was you who made her refuse to Marquis. You think her dowry worth trying for? - I've been sincerely in love with Suzanne for a long time. She knows that. - If you refuse, I swear I shall never marry anyone else. I am sorry monsieur, deeply sorry. It is you who are responsible for this. You were always luring me, flattering him, controlling him because Bel Ami here, Bel Ami there from morning until night. This is the return for it. I know how great a shock this is to you. But on second thought you realize that I'll make you an excellent son in law. I'll be more than a son and law, I'll be a collaborator, between us we'll build La Vie Francaise into an empire. Come here my child. Is this what you need to make you happy? Yes father. I had a different dream for you. But who knows, perhaps we shall not regret it. A man of his stand, one never knows what may happen. Then you consent? - I might have made better choice as regards position, but not as regards intelligence and prospect. You will be a deputy and a minister. I consent. I ought to talk to your mother. - I'll tell you where to find her. In front of the painting of St. Anthony. She spends all her time there now with her. Monsieur Walter has given his consent. It is all suddenly so clear to me. Clotilde, Madeleine, and now Suzanne. You distrust now, but in time, you'll become accustomed to the idea. You will give us your blessing. I hate you. I did not know that it was possible to hate anyone as much as I hate you. You are Monsieur Mayor of Canteleu? Yes madame. - You're familiar with the name of de Cantel? - This whole region once belonged to the de Cantel family. But that was long ago. - There is no one of that family alive today? The last of them was reduced to living in the forest with the wood cutters. Where is he now? He disappeared four years ago. It's thought he went to Africa. No one here knows whether he is alive or dead. If he should return, give him this. Someone is stealing his name from him. He still has a few months in which to protest, after that it will be too late, thank you monsieur. Madame, why do you do this for a man who is a stranger to you? - To prevent if possible a still greater wrong. What a brilliant writer Goethe was. Listen to this, "A woman is merely "a kind of intelligent toy which will pick "itself up if you should let it fall." - I'm not in the mood for clever quotations from Goethe. - I suppose not, but you must be reasonable. Reasonable, when you know that for years I've been in love with you, waiting for you, hoping. - What is the most difficult thing to get in this world? The thing we pay most dearly for, snatch from each other, fight for, the thing only we obtain by force of genius, or by luck, or by meanness, by privation, by wild efforts, resolution, energy, audacity, or work? It's money, if there is a way of getting it, straightforwardly and promptly without any fatigue, without any difficulty and without genius. Quite simply, naturally, quickly and honorably. And that way is by marriage. - I despise that brutal, cynical form of marriage. I cannot afford to despise it. The victor in this world is still the strong. One must be strong, one must be above all prejudices. Strong, you call that strength? - Egotism is everything, egotism regards ambition and fortune is better than egotism as regards to women and love. - You call it strength, but strong men do not descend to such measures, you are not strong, you are sly, cunning, you weave plots. Invent schemes, you are no better than a thief, a sleek thief. - I'm not sure that I like your saying that. Yes a thief, you deceive everyone. You take advantage of everyone. You filch money and enjoyment wherever you can. What is that but stealing. Be quiet. I will not be quiet any longer. Do you think I don't know how you robbed Madeleine of half her inheritance? Do you suppose I don't know how you wove Vanessa about Suzanne to steal her father's fortune? And now even your name is stolen. Be quiet I tell you. - You behave toward me like a cat ever since I've known you. And now you want to make out like I'm not to tell you so. What have you stolen from me but my life. My whole life! Will you be quiet. - I'll shout it from the windows, from the rooftops. Let all Paris know it. Thief, thief, thief! Someone steals my name and because a year passes before I see the newspaper in which he warns me that he intends robbing me, I cannot make this scoundrel give my name up again. That is the case exactly. - Where can I find this thief who calls himself the name de Cantel? - France is the king, to Gaston de Cantel, 15, 15. A de Cantel would rather fight a battle than tell of it. Where can I find him? - You'll find him at the office of La Vie Francaise on the boulevard. One moment monsieur. I thought of a gentleman who'd be happy to take you there. 23, 24, 25. Ah we have a distinguished visitor. 26, the ex-minister, 27, of foreign affairs. 28, 29. You call yourself Duroy de Cantel? 30, that is my name monsieur. My name is Philippe de Cantel. - Cowards find brave men to do their work for them. I understand what you mean monsieur. You think there is a de Cantel too many. I think so too, will you act for me Jacques? Of course. I have the honor to represent the veritable Monsieur de Cantel. Shall call on you within the hour. Very good monsieur. Where could he have sprung from, this de Cantel, they told me there were none of them left. My lip is bleeding, he's a regular buffalo. He'd choose a sword I suppose. No not the sword. - But this fella looks as if he lived by hunting. He'd be accustomed to firearms. - My enemies will try to make a scandal of this. With my wedding only two weeks off. I must kill this unfortunate young man, that is very evident, that is the only way to make my position good. I should put a stop to everything by that. All stories, all gossip, everything. But the sword, I might do no more than wound him. But the pistol, I'm a good shot you know. I can put the bullet right there. There are a lot of necessary organs there. A good case of. Who do you want to take with you, Potin? You can count on me. I count on your discretion gentlemen, do not let this little matter go beyond these walls. Come along Potin. - Someone marked this paper and sent it to him. You must tell me what's wrong. Why have you brought me here? - I'm afraid there's no rain before morning. The cab man must think we're insane. Nothing surprises a Parisian cab driver. I don't understand you at all. I hardly expected to see you again after our last meeting. Then suddenly, you get me out of bed in the middle of the night, and bring me to. - I think I hate trees, all this vegetation lives by devouring us. What a morbid idea. I made my will this afternoon. But why, what has happened to you? - I provided for my old father, he doesn't need much. And left everything else to you and little Laurine. What is it that threatens you? Are you in some danger? - 10, I had the idea in any case that I might die. But why, why? 25. What is it Bel Ami, please tell me. I made an admission to myself tonight. An admission that I thought I ought to make to you also since it concerns you. That's why I got you up in the middle of the night and brought you to the. What sort of admission? - There are two people in the world that I love. You and little Laurine. That last time we met, if you could put that out of your mind, and remember this instead? But what is all this talk of dying? - There's no need to be alarmed, quite the contrary. One never knows what may happen in a duel with pistols. A duel. I do not share your anxiety madame. And I shall not go the to make myself ridiculous. Have no fears for Bel Ami. I've seen him shoot, he'll come out of this affair with his skin and his honor intact. Suzanne's interference would only embarrass him. Now I'm going to bed, and I recommend that you do the same. But it is a duel with pistols, and both men will shoot to kill. I have such a dreadful presentment. If you could get him to give up this young man's name, if you would agree to marry him without it, then he could withdraw with honor. He need only say he was misinformed, that he was given to understand that the name had died off. I never cared about the name, it was only for father's sake. Later on, when this is forgotten, he can surely find another title that will please your father. You make me ashamed. You love him so much even though he's to marry me. There are not many who would think more of his safety than of their own pride. Mother, if father won't come with us, I'll get. We must go at once. - Hurry or you'll be too late, but do not say who sent you. - You're not to fire until the signal has been given. The signal for firing will be the dropping of the handkerchief, you may fire immediately upon this signal if you wish, it is permitted however to advance 10 paces to the point indicated by the walking stick before firing. If one of you is wounded, he's allowed one minute to fire on his antagonist from the moment he is hit. But if he has fallen on the ground, he will be allowed two minutes. His adversary must stand and receive his fire. Is everything clear? Potin, will you bring the pistols? Monsieur. The participants are not to address each other directly. Will you be so kind Jacques, as to offer my adversary a cigar, a good cigar puts the nerves in order. And I do not wish to take an unfair advantage. Monsieur? I have no nerves. I suspected as much, nevertheless, I'm distressed to see my adversary exposed to this wretched rain, is he quite sure that he will not accept one of our umbrellas? Monsieur? I'm used to shooting in foul weather. - In that case, perhaps I might be permitted to retain my umbrella, I should not like to quit the field of honor with a bad case of sniffles. Monsieur? I have no objection. - The pistols were obtained he loaded them himself and sealed the box in the presence of witnesses. - Potin, you might suggest to Monsieur Laroche Mathieu, that he observe the encounter from behind one of these beautiful trees. He presents an incredibly tempting target. You will take your positions gentlemen. Are you ready gentlemen? Ready. Ready. I'm not done for yet! One minute and 12 seconds remaining. One minute! 30 seconds. Fire, fire! One moment. Bel Ami. It was I who brought the newspaper to him. Do you understand, Bel Ami? I brought it to him. You see Jacques, it's nothing. Just a scratch, I've been scratched. By an old cat. Clotilde. I could have been happy with Clotilde. We are all no more than puppets, unless we believe.
