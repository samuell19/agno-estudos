Gone to earth! Foxy? They're out tonight, father. I heard 'em. Foxy heard 'em too. You little blessin'... running away like that. If you're lost, I'm lost. Sit you there. There's bones for supper. I've gotten some tin cups over by God's little mountain. Get up! Maybe the black meet's set for tonight... like it says here in my mam's book. I never looked back or I'd be dead by now. But you're not dead, I see. No daughter of mine will stuff herself with them old wives' tales! You old beast, you! You don't take a needle to that dress, you'll be motherin' naked within a week! It will not mend. Foxy would like me to get a new one! I'll go to Wenlock in the morning. The stew's burned again! Stop yammering! Play "Harps in Heaven." "The Mountain Ash." Beneath the roots lays father dear, So dear She be the tree that grew from out upon him The mountain ash will bring me luck and treasures many, The Mother Ash is life and rare as angel's hair Beneath her shade we shelter beasts and men all free from care. Hey, missy! You forgot the old one! Margerine, Mr. James, is just as good as butter. Butter's made of milk! But where does milk come from? From the cows. - And what does the cow eat? - Buttercups, eh? Vegetation. Now what... I say... Hazel ! How do I look, cousin Albert ? Jam! My word, you're jam, Hazel! I'm going to tea at auntie's now. I'm fair famished! I can always take ten minutes for tea time! Are you staying the night, Hazel? There's a magic lantern show on tonight. Maybe your mother won't ask me to stay. You leave that to me, Hazel! You were saying when we was interrupted, Albert... Sorry, Mr. James, what was I saying? Vegetation. Oh vegetation, yes, now... Margerine is made from vegetation, like... well, like butter. Made by machines, not cows! Just as good. Now let me explain... Butter doesn't need any explanation, Albert. Good day. Good day, Mr. James. I never seen a magic lantern show, Albert! By gum, Hazel, you're... you're butter! A disgrace the way you look in that dress! You look like an actress! Do I, Aunt Prowde? You do. You quite draw men's eyes. It's nice to draw men's eyes. Ain't it, Aunt Prowde? Jam! If you go on the way you're going, you'll get picked up my girl. I'd like to see anyone pick me up! I'd kick! I don't know about that. You take after your ma. I'd be glad. You ought to be as glad to take after one parent as another. Your mother was a gypsy. Some Christian to be born in a caravan as she were. She was as good a Christian as some folk! Are you going back to the store? Well, see you later, Hazel. You won't see her later cause Hazel must start now to get back before nightfall. Hazel's staying the night, mother, surely! She must go back to her father. We're short a room as it is. She can have my room. Hazel cannot have your room. It's not suitable. Well... let her share yours, then. Little I thought when your dear father went, that before three years passed, you'd be so forgetful of my comfort as to suggest such a thing! As long as I live, my room's mine! When I'm gone... the sooner the better for you, no doubt... you can put her in my room, and yourself, too! See here, that he never will! I keeps myself to myself! What the devil are you doing down there? She would not let me bide the night. My foot's blistered in a balloon... and there's blood on my new dress. What's your name? Hazel. Hazel what? Just Hazel. Well mine's Reddin... Jack Reddin... and why you're so dark about yours, I don't know. But up you get anyway. Your arm pulling me in be like the Sunday school tale of Jesus Christ and Peter on the wild sea. Me bein' Peter. Vessons! - Young lady's lost her way. - You'll find it for her, I've no doubt. Get the brood mares in. They should have been in by this hour. There, Randler... I cannot bear hound dogs... Nasty snapping things. What's the matter with you? You lie down, you fool. You've seen a girl before. You hunt poor foxes? So we ought. Vermin. You look like a hound dog when you laugh. And you, you keep away from our Foxy. Who's Foxy? A little small cub as I took and reared. You reared her, did you? Aye, she lost her mam. I'm her mam now. You like that picture? Or is it the dress you like? If you stayed the night, then you could wear a new dress every day of the week. If ifs and ands were beans and bacon, there's few would go with empty bellies! Put it on. I'll see how Vessons is getting on with the supper. - She'll do. - How d'you know you'll do yourself? I can't stand your manners much longer, Vessons! Give me notice, then. Get back to your kitchen. Never shall it be said that a poor unprotected female - found no friend in Andrew Vessons. - Oh shut up. Who taught you to sing? Father. Who is your father? Father's wonderful with the music. He wins money prizes. And he plays the chapel weekends up on God's Little Mountain. Supper's burnt! How did you do that, you fool? I think to the lady teaching me how to sing. Get out of the stable and stay there. Can't he stay in the house? Put it on. I'd rather not. Put it on, m'lady. I ain't your lady. Old feller... Where be you? What, after the older now? I will not stay alone with him. So he's had his trouble for nothing. Hazel ? Alright, sulk. It doesn't hurt me. I never ran after a woman in my life. Hungry? You can have my room above the stables for the night. There's a key to it. Here you be. - Where will you sleep, Mr. Vessons? - Never you mind! No woman should ever tell Andrew Vessons where to sleep. I'll wake you at daybreak. - A mug of beer? I brew it myself. - If you don't mind, I'd rather tea. Tea? Lord, how furiously do the women rage after tea. Tea it shall be! Come on! Come on, Mary Ann! Where do you live? You needn't be scared to tell me. I'm six and sixty. - You'll not tell him? - Him? Not wild horses shall drag it from me... nor yet, blood horses! Nor hunters, nor cart-horses... Nor Suffolk punches. I lived at the Callow. Callow? That lost and forgotten place to the side of God's little mountain? It isn't lost and forgotten. - We've got bees. - So have I got bees! And the music. The music? What's a music? You can't eat a music. - My dad makes coffins. - Does he now? Ahh, but you haven't got a swan made out of a euc tree. Twenty years I've been a-clippin' it. Only the beak is missing. Never tell him where I live. Never in life! Never tell him... unless he asks it to you, and cannot rest. He may ask till doomsday. This is to Undern ? Never will I... - Edward ? - Yes mother? You told me a lady singer was coming. Yes, that's right. Her father accompanies her on the harp. Mr. and Ms. Woodus. Hazel! Come on, girl! Take care! A while since, before you were born, a cow and a calf fell down that there place. Hundreds of feet. - Did you save them? - Psssht -- lord, no. They was all of a jelly. Oh, I cannot bear it. It's a fearsome place. Lord, now what's the matter with the girl? Naught... Only it came on me as... - I'll die as well as others. - You just found that out? What a queen of fools you be! Seems the world's a big spring trap and us in it. Hark, to the music! You're too nesh [susceptible], that's what you be. Nesh. Good afternoon, Mr. Woodus. Glad to see you, and you, Miss Woodus. It's a fine day! We were afraid you weren't coming. Minister, there's Abel Woodus and his girl now. "Harps in heaven." Harps in heaven, play for you, Played for Christ with his eyes so blue Played for Peter and for Paul But never played for me at all Harps in heaven, made all of glass, Greener than the rainy grass, Played for Peter and for Paul But never played for me at all Harps in heaven Play high Play low In the cold rainy wind I go To find - My harp... - Keep time girl! As green as spring My splintered harp without a string This your neck of the woods, my man?* Many of 26 six years, come Autumn it is. You know a chap around here plays the fiddle well? With a pretty daughter. Can't say a sight comes to mind. Go on Hazel, have another one. Why not? All the years I've been here I've had tartlets, and tartlets I love. I pay the same as others. They're all gone, Mr. James. I've had no finger in emptying of 'em. You sang beautifully, Miss Woodus. Very beautifully. Have a tartlet, minister? If he's not fixed on his sermon... I should be very pleased if you'd come to supper on Sunday. What will the sweet old lady say? Oh, my mother would be very pleased too. And you can tell your father I should see you at home. I'm much obliged. Then we shall meet again Sunday. Thank you. Mother, I've asked Miss Woodus to supper, on Sunday. - She is not of your class, Edward. - What does class matter? Whether it is mistaken kindness, dear, or silly flirtation, it can only do you harm at the congretation. Don't bother with the congregation. People are waiting for you to say grace, dear. Sisters and brethren, silence for grace. For what we have received, may the Lord make us truly thankful. I have not received tartlets, I am not thankful. That little vixen again! Foxy! Get out! Next time it's the pond and a spin round in it! - You daren't! - We'll see if I dare'st! There, there, Foxy. She's lonesome. I must take her along with us. I thought so... Would a terrier do that? A well-trained terrier? She's a fox. Fox or terriers, I make the laws. What goes against me gets drowned. It ain't all for you. The world wasn't made in 7 days all over Abel Woodus ! Put her in the coffin. You've come back very pert from Wenlock this time, very pert you are. You're too uppish! It's time you was married! If anyone be fool enough to ask you. Maybe there's many as would! Maybe I'll marry a fine gentleman. It'd be worth it to get away from the cabin. Well, your house couldn't be any dirtier than it is now! I swear I'll wed the first that comes, the very first. What will you swear by? Will you swear by God's little mountain? You swear to marry the first who comes, whoever he be? I swear. Two pints of rough. Might be the black huntsman himself. - Hey, lord! - Come in, sir. Good evening. - I'll hold your horse. - No, I won't come in, sherry out here please. Sarah, a glass of sherry for the gentleman. Do you know any pretty girl around here, with black hair, green eyes... No sir, what women there are around here are weathered and hardened. Little fiddler chap? Plays at the parrish meetings. If it's music you're after, I know music better than fiddles. That's harp! Think I look like an angel? A concert, funeral or a wedding, I'm your man. - Might be the last. - Weddin' or beddin', eh squire? He's got the blood of little foxes on him, Foxy. Any fiddlers in your parrish, parson? Yes. There's one the far side of the mountain. - Pretty daughter? - No. He's only 20. And I told father I'd marry the first would come. I swore it by the mountain. - And eh, nobody came? - Never a one. Nobody at all? Never a one. And if anyone came and asked you to marry him, - you would? - Well, I'm bound to, seemingly. But none'll ever come. What for should they? Should you like to be married? My mam did not like it. She said tears and torment, tears and torment was a married lot. And she said "keep yourself to yourself, "You weren't made for marrying anymore than me. "Eat in company but sleep alone." That's what she said, Mr. Marston. And how many brothers and sisters have you, my dear? Never a one. Nobody but our Foxy. Edward too has none. - Give her a chair, my dear. - I'm well enough as I am. And who is Foxy? My little cub. You speak as if the animal were a relation, dear. So all animals be my brothers and sisters. I know dear, quite right, all animals in conversation, should be so. But any single animal, in reality, is only an animal. And animals have no souls. Yes, they have them. If they have none, you have none. Perhaps you will read to us, dear. Yes mother. I wonder who that can be at this hour? Martha will answer it. Who can it be ridin' late at night, Mrs. Marston? Did you hear a horse, my dear? I don't know... A fiddler chap with a pretty daughter! Mother... I'm sorry to look in so late, Mrs. Marston, but I met a gentleman on horseback in the lane asking all kinds of questions And I had to walk back with him to the crossroads. You said you wanted something from Wenlock? Oh yes, some knitting wool, the same as before. Edward, Miss Woodus wants to go home. Were there anybody else there, at the door? I thought I heard someone. Will you marry me, Hazel? You've been mighty quick about it. Yes, I know I have. It's me! Bide a minute, Mr. Marston. Here she is. So this is Foxy. Will you marry me, Hazel? I can give you a good home. And I'll try and be a good husband to you. And I love you. Do you love me as much as I love Foxy? Far more. Ain't she a dear? Go along now. - Blast you! I oughtta ring her neck. - I let her go loose. - Who's here? - Edward Marston. Oh, it's you, minister. Had a long walk for your trouble? I wanted to see you. Well, here I be. I want to marry Hazel. You want her? You want to marry her? Yes. Well, I suppose her is a woman grown. You can have her. When do you want her? Hazel must decide that. Lord, man, tell her what to do, she'll do it... you take a stick to her now and again. When will you be my wife, Hazel? I don't know. Not for days and days. Look at her. Throw somethin' at her man! I think I should prefer your absence. Go away! That's the way to talk to him. What do you say to next August? I'd like it right well. The Sunday after the county fair. - Dad and me are going. - Then we'll go together. My mother would help to gather things. What kind of things? Pretty clothes. You'd like that, wouldn't you? Thank you kindly, minister. Edward. It's not lack of belief in Thy will, Father, but I ask You to marry me now. Because what I want, is not for myself. I want to protect her. To cherish her. In my house... like a flower. And this I promise that I shall ask nothing of her. Nothing... until she wants to be wife to me. It seems he's run off. What's wrong, Jack? Well, you've given me a long enough chase. Go away Mr. Reddin. What's this I hear about you and the parson? - He's going to marry me tomorrow. - The devil he is. Who to? To him! - What? - We're going to be wed. The parson and you? And Foxy's comin' too. And he's givin' me a box full of clothes. So did I. Yours are old ones! - You've got to come and talk to me while they're dancing. - I can't. If you don't, I'll tell the parson you stayed the night at Undern. And he won't marry you! You wouldn't do that, Mr. Reddin! Wouldn't I? Is the minister staying for the dancing? Is your father here? Well then tell the parson you're staying with him. - What went wrong, Mr. Reddin? - Everything! I saw you with Mr. Reddin this afternoon. I only wanted to say in a sisterly and Christian spirit he's not a good man. Well, that's something anyway! If you take my advice, you'll leave him alone. I cannot. Oh, why not? He will not let me. Hazel, can't you see that I'm in love with you? What for be? There's you, and there's Edward. Why can't you leave me be? I never thought I'd come to 40 and be like this. Be 40? - I suppose the parson's young. - Him the right age. I'll show you who's the right age! Hands off, Mr. Reddin! Now come and dance. Let's see if a man of 40 can't tie you! What's the good, Mr. Reddin? I'm promised. Hazel, you do like me, don't you? Better than the parson. Who's that? Father. I want to marry your daughter. First the parson, then the squire. It'll be the king on his throne next! Did you hear what I said? She's set. Set. Bespoke. Let. - She has a right to change her mind. - A bargain's a bargain. The cake's made, mister, and so's the bed. 50 pounds! You should go away with a check in your pocket if she comes with me. 50 pounds! It's all I've got in money cash. Hey, mister, you didn't need to go and entice me. I could have... I could have the garden lined with beehives from end to end. The wood I could buy, and the white paint. And queens from foreign parts. A bargain's a bargain, Hazel. You may not go with this gentleman. Mind you. Many's the time in the past you've gone against me, against what I've said. Many a time... I know you don't like hurting things, Hazel... you're hurting me. It ain't my fault! I'm always hurtin' things... ain't my fault. Edward will look after me, and Foxy, and the others. And you, you've got blood on you, Mr. Reddin! Well, I'll even forget the hunting if you check the parson, I promise! You wouldn't keep it. Seems I have to go against you or Edward. And I cannot go against Edward. He set store by me... and I swore by the mountain. What? If I broke that oath... my cold sould would wander about the mountain... finding never a bit of rest... and Edward thinkin' it were the wind. What was it you swore? To marry the first that comes. It wasn't you, Mr. Reddin! It wasn't you! Bring us back a piece of wedding cake! Long live the minister say I! You'll not get another bite of that apple! The animal has no business in a place of worship. What for not? Because not! Whoever made you made Foxy. "Let be other sheep I have which are not of this fold. "Them also will I bring." "We are gathered together here to witness the union of this man "and this woman in the sacred covenant of marriage. "To hear their vows, and to seek for them the blessing of God in whose presence we stand "Therefore it is fit that we bear in mind that marriage was ordained of God "for the increase of mankind according to His will..." Mrs. Marston... Shall I draw the blind, ma'am? Oh let me in. On the profession of thy faith in Christ, I baptize thee... in the name of the Father... and of the Son... and of the Holy Spirit. My dear... it was beautiful, beautiful. One of the nicest baptisms I ever saw! Oh, dear... there's always someone. Hazel, you'd better go upstairs, dear. Good afternoon. I'd like to see the minister May I come in? Oh yes, yes. Do come in. Such a hot day... My son won't be a moment. Can I get you something to drink, Mr...? Reddin. Jack Reddin, of Undern. If you have a little sherry, perhaps? I must doubt that we have any of last Christmas pudding's bottle left... but I'll go and see. Hazel? Or shall I come up? Leave me be. You don't want me to. Meet me at "Hunter's Spinny", next Sunday, same time as now. Martha, the best glasses... Promise. Why? Because I say so. I'm quite put out about that sherry, but here's some sparkling gooseberry wine. Four years old last midsummer. Oh, you've met my daughter-in-law, Mrs. Edward Marston? Allow me... Quite up, you see! Are you alright, Hazel? Edward, there's a gentleman to see you, dear. Mr. Reddin of Undern. Ah yes, Mr. Reddin. - How do you do? - Pleased to meet you. I saw a bit of your baptism. Very amusing. Perhaps I'll come again one day. You're welcome, Mr. Reddin. The next time, perhaps you'll find it even more amusing. The third time, you'll be singing hymns with us... and the fourth time... thank you mother... I might even be baptizing you. You seem very sure of yourself, Parson. I'm sure of my faith, Squire. Sorry, Hazel. - "The Harper's Charm" ? - It's my mam's book. Hazel, may I... may I see it? "When at once, a little at midnight, "climbed to the steepest stones on the top of God's little mountain. "Lay your shawl on the "The Devil's Chair"... "and walk around it..." - Finish it? - That's the other way to the sun. "Ask your wish. "And if the undertaking is good, "you will hear the fairy music. "If you hear it, ever so faintly, "you can go to the end of your undertaking. "And there'll be no tears in it." This is a sure charm... It cannot be broke. What is this... "important undertaking" ? Has it anything to do with me? Hazel, can't you tell me? If I was caught in a trap, Eddard, who'd help me out? God would. He didn't let the others out. He does answer prayers, Hazel. If he did, where would the fox-huntin' gents be? And who'd eat rabbit pie? Hazel, are you really happy here? Ah... I be. I'd thought... you might... Father? You're my father... and mother both. Goodnight, Hazel. If I be to go down to "Hunter's Spinny..." If I be to go... let me hear the fairy music. Mrs. Marston! Martha, look. Call your master. Mother... Hazel is safe. Thank you, all of you. Please excuse me. Where is she? You's the one should know. Isn't she here? Nope. Ain't she on the mountain? No... She's gone. Run off, is she? Have you... have you any idea where she is? - Haven't you? - Have you!? No, I don't. I ain't. A bargain's a bargain. That's what I told her. You married her. You best find her. You're up early for a married woman... or whatever you may be, missy. Haha, you're jealous! "A Mrs. of Undern? Never will I!" Them blackbirds! Is after my fruit. I'll kill 'em! I'll kill 'em dead! If you shoot a blackbird, the milk'll turn bloody! Jack! Jack, come and stop him! Stop it, Vessons ! Vessons, do you hear? I'd rather it was me than the blackbirds! He's got another one. It's like I've killed 'em comin' here to Undern. Nonsense. Bloody, is it? Well is it? And now it's notice. Notice has been given, One month, by Andrew Vessons to John Reddin, as friar of Undern! - You and I can't part, you know that. - We must! But why, man? What's wrong, Andrew? She mocked me. Did you, Hazel? - I only said-- - Her said "never will I"! Ah, that's what her said! Never will I, that's what I say. What have you been doing to the old man? I do know a woman's will. Maiden I stay to my dying day. Now look here, man. Be reasonable. Listen to me. - I'm your master, aren't I? - Ah, till a month. And you take your orders from me. I'm master here. So we say no more about it. Notice is took back. Come back here, Hazel! Open the door! Ah, what's the matter? You want that old feller more than you want me! Don't be silly. He has his uses, you have yours. If you ain't gonna be civil-spoken, I'll go. You can't go. Shall I tell you why? - Who cried in "Hunter's Spinny" ? - No, don't, Hazel... Who had tears in his eyes? Who sat there without a breath in him... and the tears comin' down his cheeks like a baby? You do want to stay. You did want to come with me, didn't you? Not till you made me. But maybe you couldn't help it... maybe you was drove to it. What by? Something strong, as drives us all. Hazel, if... - if I told you that... - No. Don't say aught. If you're gonna run words, come from below your tongue like Eddard can. I wish I had Foxy here. I'll go get her in the morning. No, let her bide. She's safe at Eddard's. Tea, Edward. I know where Hazel is. You know where she is, Mother? Why didn't you tell me? I am telling you, dear. It's all over the town. Most unpleasant. - But I never thought Hazel was steadfast... - Mother, where is she? You're all in a fever, you've had nothing to eat yet. A little preserves. Your poor father always said you'd break that some day and you have. The best dish. Well, jam, I'll say nothing about jam, it's jam after all! Mother! Where is she? It was much more peaceful without her. And I wish Mr. Reddin well. Reddin? Mr. Reddin, of Undern. Where are you going? Listen, Jack... Just like my dad's harp... I've got a horse and trap outside. I've come to take you home. Oh Eddard! Get your things. What for did you come? He'll be back any minute. You're my wife and you're coming back with me. Do you want me to drag you out? Or are you coming of your own accord? You went with him of your own accord, didn't you? Didn't you? Uh-huh, but I didn't want to, I didn't.. How can both be true? How did he compel you to go? How? The signs said to go down to "Hunter's Spinny." And then... and then he pulled me on his horse and brought me here. The signs... The harper's charm. And then you went to the end of your undertaking and there were no tears. How simple! How very simple. Every village I went through this evening... everybody knew it! - Everybody except me. - Oh, leave me be, Eddard. I can't bear it. You told a good many lies, didn't you? Be kind, Eddard. What a fool I was. Well, I'm not particular. And you're my wife. She was never your wife. Go on, get your things. No use talking, Parson. She's mine. From head to foot. You swine. Now you're talking. - If you want to fight come outside. - Don't lay a finger on him! Why, is it bad manners to fight in front of a lady? Or is the guest beneath your roof sacred? And not his wife under his own. - You want to fight, say so, but don't preach all night. - Hands off him! Can't you see she needs a man, not a short-winded Parson? She needs a man to hold her, and not by preaching! She and the other little vixen. Let me go! I want to go with Eddard and Foxy ! You don't know what you want. I don't want to see you ever, Jack Reddin. You're a cruel beast. And you got blood on you. Well, go with him then. See how you like it. You can have her, Marston. When I want her, she'll come running. Come, my soul. Has she ever called you that? Get out of here, both of you, before I throw you out. Will you be three for dinner? Or one? Get out! Are you going to bring this woman back under your roof? If you bring that woman here, I will be no mother to you! Eddie... No! My little lad, I'm getting old, dear. I haven't many more years. She has all her lifetime. You will put me before her...? When the Mrs. goes, I go. I kept myself respectable all these years and I'll serve no light woman... Very well, Martha. ... Nor sleep in a house given over to sin. You're not going tonight, mother. I will not stay for one hour under the same roof as that wicked woman. What are you staring at? The world, Mother. I shall stay the night at the hunter's arms. Martha can pack my things tomorrow. Morning. Good morning, Master. You wish to speak to us? To you. Come in. This young woman might, I think, absent herself. Would you rather stay or go, Hazel? Stay along with you, Eddard. We've come, minister, six god-fearing men, With me, spokesman, being senior deacon... Yes, get on with it. We bring you the Lord's message, minister. I speak for Him. You're sure? Has not he answered us each and several with a loud voice in the night watches? - Praise the Lord. - Ay, that be true. What we are to say is this... the adulteress must go. If you don't dismiss this female, we'll take it to the church meeting. No need. We're going. Oh, don't say that, minister. Oh yes. I'm giving up the ministry. If you take this woman with you, you'll be accursed. I suppose you know what they're saying? - Saying? - That you've made a tidy bit. Mr. James, the check signed J. Reddin goin' into your bank, dear me. Of course, we know it isn't true, minister. Don't mind 'em, my soul. Curse you! Curse you for tormentin' my Eddard! It is the best man in all the county. The best! And you, yourself, a sinner! And who are you to judge? How do you know it was Hazel's fault? It was mine. I could try and explain... but not to you! You think everybody has a price, as you have, James. Now let me finish. I'd like to flog you off the mountain, James. But you rule this world, little, smug, pompy gods. Get out! Please go, all of you. Foxy... Foxy, darling. Alright then, let 'em in. Try over there... Drown 'em out... drown 'em out! You'll find him. You'll find him there. They're after us, Foxy. Follow, follow... Gone away... Hazel? My God, it's a girl! - It's a girl! - Call 'em off then! Which way are they headin'? "Hunter's Spinny"! Head aloft! Coming, Hazel! - They'll pull you down! - Drop it, they'll pull you down! Give her to me, you little fool, give her to me! Gone to earth!
