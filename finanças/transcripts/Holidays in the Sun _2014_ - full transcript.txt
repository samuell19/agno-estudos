In Socialist Yugoslavia, the law guaranteed to every working man two weeks of cost-free vacation. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Careful with that shit, you'll cut my throat! Not just yet. I need you. I cum faster... than you shave. Drunk bastard. Oh, by the way Metod knows about us. I don't think he's happy about it. - Hi, Mom! - Hi! You're pale. Do you eat anything at all? Sure, Mom. Almost every day. - How are you? - Never felt better. Alive. Mom, I gotta go to work. I'll call you. Wait. Have you really bought this flat for me? Sure. I took a loan. That's how it's done these days. This is your flat, Mom. A nice lady from the bank called me. She mentioned some foreclosure. Don't worry, Mom I'll call that... nice lady. Maybe I'm a little late with my payment. How's your foot? - Kiss, I really gotta go now. - Wait! I can go to an old people's home. Like everybody else. I'll have company.

Please, call later. HOLIDAYS IN THE SUN Do they really think that I'm such a dork? To listen to their bullshit for three hours?! Go there alone. We gave our word and signed the paper... You signed it, not me! You and your “free” vacation! You go to the seaside only with a loads of money! What did you put in the form? Five thousand Marks a month? Why did you lie? Why... Oh my God, Svendy. Stop that! Fuck, all wet! I'm swimming with the Action Man. What do we have in mind when we sell timeshare? That we are not just salespeople! We are doctors! We save lives! Vacationing is good for health! You don't go on a vacation - you get a heart attack! It's not only lives that we're saving. We save marriages, too. We save families. That makes us doctors, firemen. And lifeguards on the, shit, beach. We save, shit, lives! - Because timeshare... - What's wrong? Had a rough night? It is a stronger bond than the holy sacrament of marriage. Want some... first aid? What is marriage in the modern society? Marriage lasts for couple of years. You don't care about saving lives? - But a week in our apartments... - I've got a killing hangover. They'll have it until the rest of the lives of their kids! Grandchildren! Great-grandchildren! I fuck you over. Batric! I'll fuck both of you. ...but our clients are ungrateful. That's why we call them fly-bys! They want to use the free vacation and fly away! Bur we're here to not let them! My God, we're late! Come on! Another 100 meters, and I'd get a heart attack. You paid 800 Euros for silver fiber pillows. And 1300 Euros for a set of fucking pots. It was 1200, watch your language. You went for a free blood pressure check-up. They sold you a massage chair for 2000 Euros. - I got my eye pressure checked, too. - On both eyes. Mother, they rip you off every time! All those thing I bought will someday belong to you... To your family. Your children. To enjoy. My hypothetical wife would have an abortion in a massage chair, and I would choke my hypothetical children with a fiber pillow. I'll get it! I'll get it. To get ownership over a condo for 99 years. One week per year. An excellent investment! Mother, there are hidden costs here. It's almost impossible to resell it on the real estate market! What if it's really a bargain? Fuck this life. I could've unpacked you first! Take it easy, Slobo. I want to use every second of this vacation. We can fuck at home anytime. My God, how nice of them! It's like in celebrity magazines, honeymoon report. - Should I make a photo? - Not when I'm like this. My God, my milk is everywhere. Oh, man... we're busted. Don't be such a pessimist. That's why you're still just an elementary school teacher. Right... A hairdresser and a teacher, celebrity magazine newlyweds. Like, you're the only one who misses Sladjana? Like, only her father is in pain? We'd never get a free vacation if we reported the baby, our income would be too low. Never! Saint Petka, please. May this vacation turn out to be good, may Sladjana be in good health, and that we get a bank loan for the apartment and the car. Stop it, will you?! We create a bond! Today we've got newlyweds from... From the charming Serbian town of... Nis. - They got special treatment. - That's right. Olga. Today, they belong to God and... - Me, me! - And... To you. Let's shake these old Macedonian bones, shall we? - Thank you, boss. - Old whore. But usually guys get the newlyweds. The statistics say... You can do that when you open your own business! You should thank Savic for this. Sex with the bride on her honeymoon is not our policy. Anything for the client, boss. They bought two weeks. In prime season. You can be the best and still follow business ethics, shit! * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * The presentation will start now. - Do we get something to eat? - It's everything ON-clusive. Get your hands up! Come on! Put them back down. You're not taking that with you! You won't embarrass me! - It's upside down. - You're upside down. Okay. I won't embarrass you... there. Be nice! - You're just like your father. - Let's go. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * I will do the Warming Up today. My lovely wife will confirm this. My foreplay is unbeatable. Don't let these people go away from us to enjoy six days of free vacation. That's not fair! In Socialism, every piece of shit could go to the seaside. Nothing in this world is free. - But the cheese in the mousetrap. - That's right. Today, we've got a special guest. Mister Dietrich Pfizer, from the head office honored us with his visit. Stop it, junkie. He's got exciting news. Anyone who makes a sale today gonna get double commission! Besides... Today's margin is not 13000, but 12000 Euros! Allowing you to lower the price! However... Old merits do not apply today. Anyone who doesn't manage to make a sale today is free to go. Without severance pay. Today, we'll forget about the past achievements. We'll forget everything, shit! We'll forget who was the salesperson of the year. How about the salesperson of the month? - You're completely safe. - Really? This applies even to my lovely wife. This applies to me, too. If you fuck up, we're all going down! We feel much better now. For your information, Savic.. Mr. Pfizer said that even the Greeks are better than us! - That's how they see us! - Danke. I got a truck driver! Who let a truck driver in here, anyway? A retired truck driver?! Somebody's fucking with Batric here! No fucking around with me! You got lucky again, you little cunt? Let me see. Two hundred Euros to swap. Anybody? 200 Euros, to swap. Come on! You've reached SOS Rank Call center. All our operators are busy at the moment. One, two, is this on, shit? Good morning everybody. Welcome to the exclusive Flamingo Resort, this pearl of the Adriatic! - Poor man. - An invalid, and he has to work. Tragic life story. Flamingo used to be a West Europeans-only resort. Today, Flamingo is free! Fuck this. - After our presentation... - Like I'm back to school. Can I get a beer around here? You will say this is our pearl of the Adriatic! In the old times, everybody went to the seaside. - No way, today! - Svendy... You want a beer? A small one? Want it? Here's what you get! You had a bunch of worker's holiday camps all over the coast! Where are these holiday camps now, if I may ask? Follow me, please. Sorry, catch you later. In free Croatia only. Even an invalid can earn his daily bread. Let's go. Get up. Go ahead. I want a waiter. Everybody's gone! You've reached SOS Bank Call center. All our operators are busy at the moment. You are currently no. 14 in the queue. That is why those “holiday camps” today look... like this! Vacation is not, shit, just for everyone! One has to earn it! Vacation is for people like you! You broke free from Communism! You took control of your destiny! You are the true winners! Congratulations! Follow me! This guy's full of bullshit. - He's full of bullshit. - Shut up, both of you. Before you make this major step in your life, let's make a toast to our newlyweds, a couple from the friendly city of Nis! - We're busted. - Lovely Dragana and hefty Slobodan. Flammy... one big hug for our dear guests! That's a good one! - You really shouldn't have... - Look at him! It's a stark. Waiter! You are currently no. 9 in the queue. Good morning. My name is Mladen, I will be your host today. - If you have any question at all... - I've got one. - Who said you can sit here? - Come on! Guy over there. The Slovenian, my boss. - The invalid? - Seriously disabled. - From the war? - You hear the man. Slovenian. Nobody can understand them, why would anybody fight against them? Although... they fuck you Serbs over. You speak our language? Bosnian? A little... But I understand everything. - The pushy guy, huh?! - Go ahead, draw. I go for a beer, you're here for my kidney. You want my kidney? Where do I sign? - He's joking. - I know. Joking, my ass. - Where are you from, buddy? - Belgrade. - Where are you going? - To fetch the waiter. Or to get these papers for the kidney. Do your stuff. I'll manage alone. Your fucking free vacation. Domestic or German beer? German. They've got German. Easy to please... Bosnian prick. We get only scumbags from there. That's what you get when you fuck the boss's wife. Maybe he thinks that I've fallen in love with you. A man who sold a 99 years deal to a person dying of cancer? He an fall in love? I was coked-up. I thought we are all immortal. I gave him comfort. At least half of these poor fuckers are dead meat. Too bad I didn't get the Croatian war veteran. I would've wrapped him up in half an hour. The Macedonian hag is dead, only she doesn't know it yet. Check out fatso's tits. She left a suckling baby at home. Typical fly-by. You're not a buyer if you're wasting money on baby shit. Tuzla. Video rental store owner. Proletarian. Look here! Bosnian war veteran. The hillbilly carries some serious cash though. Last ice cream, kid. The rest of the money goes to uncle Mladen, for the deposit. I don't want the kid to catch cold. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * How many of you have already been on a vacation? Don't lie, we've never been on a vacation. We are now. You, you, you.. Almost everyone! Does a field trip count? Vacationing is important! But, once you go back home, what do you have from it? A couple of color photos that end up in a drawer. Some won't have even that. So I forgot the fucking camera. Kill me now! Don't worry, Dad, I'll draw you. Where is all the money spent for vacation? Gone! Vanished! Lost forever! That's not real money, right? That's all false values, my Svendy. Who cares? * * * * * * * * * * * * Salesman of the month is on his knees! - Oh my God! - Hey, Serb... Repent with me, Pedro, a servant of God. - No, thanks. - Great. I mean... I'd feel great if Metod gave me Southern hillbillies. The old hag got the newlyweds? He's fucking over his best salesman, torturing him like they tortured Jesus. What about your clients? Nice people. Father and daughter. Intellectuals. Now, just a line of good old... H, to relax. And that's it. The best Flamingo salesman having troubles with his prostate? Shaking off is a problem, too. Wanna help? Of course! Out of respect! Get away from me, you crazy bitch! Just go ahead and shag, shag. Batric loves faggots. More faggots, more pussy for Batric. Batric likes to bang women. Because women make shopping decisions. That's why I'd fuck the fat lady. I'd fuck her husband, too, if they sign. Homey Pedro... homo Pedro, you look pale. Hundred Euro says, that this little prick is packing his bags tomorrow. I'm in. You little cunt. You take care of it. Thanks, man. How come you're so cool? I got my lucky pen. Check this out. Montblanc, 5000 Kunas. For your lucky pen. You'll be okay. Come here. Can I just touch it? Can I kiss it? I'm good now. Our mascot and our agents will take you inside to continue with individual presentations. These who do not attend lose the right to a free vacation! My dear agents, please show our dear guests inside! Let's go. Come on. - Paying in installments is an option? - Let's go. - Some real food inside? - Of course, anything you want! - This is regular procedure. - Sit! You're from Vienna, you obey the rules. Go. Marital status? Active. Years of marriage? Six, or seven? Let's say, seven. Education qualifications? Annual income? Rascals... Look at this... real bliss. - Are we going to swim? - When we pluck up courage. - I already plucked it. - Really? Give me five. Annual income? Do I lie again? Lie if you plucked up your courage. Have you? - Let's see if Mom has the courage. - Omer! Don't! Let's see it! You two! This is exactly the same form we already filled in Nis, when we got the... voucher. Why do I have to do it all over again? It seems that your husband doesn't mind. Right. Slobodan? Teachers are used to filling up things. - They're really good at filling up. - Come on... Lady... we are on our honeymoon. Forms and romance don't match. Wipe your tears, my dear Wipe your tears, Your whole life lies ahead of you Don't let the... This one's even crazier than our guy. My husband sang this to me on our honeymoon. We were young, just like you are now. A week in Dubrovnik. A dream come true... romance! I'm so happy for you. Six months later, he was dead. Pancreas cancer. We're sorry, truly. Extremely. No smoking here. We care about your health. We hoped I'd get pregnant in Opatija. It wasn't meant to be. And you? Do you plan any children? I have to go to the toilet. He'll finish this. She's sick? Bitch lies like a dog. She keeps telling the same story. She never had a husband. - You should know that. - Really? She's a lesbian. You better watch yourself. Sugar, you can ask for another agent. I'd be really good to you. I'll be good to your man, if I need to. I can see that I turn you on. It's only natural. Type in your PIN. All our operators are busy at the moment. Estimated hold time is... 14 minutes. - Maybe she's pregnant? - No way! - Too much in the sun, maybe. - Maybe. And maybe an ownership over a condo is the right thing for newlyweds. Let me finish this first. What about this? Education qualifications? Airport tower? Put down, "Croat war veteran”. Got anything against this college? No! I say it's worth more than a PhD. Why do I get the feeling that you're fucking with me? Who, me? You've got my deepest respect. I got you by the balls now. Do I put income in Kunas or Euros? Even if I thought of buying something from you, now I won't. Call the manager. Now! What's up, boys? Can't wait to hear our special VIP offer? This sissy here never said a thing about it. You don't like me? I like you so much... I've got the brains, he's got the legs. We, defenders... We can easily work something out. - Where did you fight? - You name it. That's a real man, you sleazebag. I couldn't agree with you more. - Where is your agent? - I sent him to get a beer. German beer! No alcohol in this stage of presentation! Only a sober man can change his life! Maybe in your fucking Europe, you sober cunt! You can leave this to your children. We've got no children. Don't fuck with me, it says here "one son”. Milena! You put Bora in these. How could I not put him in? He is dead, you stupid woman. 14 years now. Dead! Love is the most beautiful thing in life. When you've got a summer house you can use it for 52 weeks per year. 52 weeks to use it... you've got 52 weeks available to use it... - to use it... - But how much do you really use it? You spend there a week or two in the summer. A week or two, in the summer... - A week or... - You just keep on with your bullshit. - For the summer... - a week or two. - And the maintenance, you pay... - ..for all 52 weeks. For the maintenance, you pay all 52 weeks. You can't use my account! I'll lose my veteran pension! How can that be profitable? - How can that be profitable? - No way. How can that be profitable? - Suck my dick! - No way. Fifty two weeks! How can that be profitable? I maintain the grave of my Bora. Fifty two weeks... every day. In the summer, you use one or two weeks out of fifty two... Don't move. I'll just go to... Can you repeat that? When you use.. From zero to hero, from zero to hero... - What's this? A cult? - Like you would know. You threaten an 80-year-old woman with eviction? A shot of rakia. - What? - Rakia. Contract? Do you really think that I carry the contract with me? Another shot. It says that the place goes to auction if you are three months overdue? I don't care if it's fucking four, I've been paying regularly for five years now! You'll get your money by the end of the week! I saw what you got from that asshole. If you were screwing my wife, I'd simply kill you. Without such a nasty revenge! But I'm a man. I'll help you. I got a great deal for you. Come here. You give me that Bosnian guy, and I give you the Viennese couple. Viennese? Sanitation manager? Public toilet cleaner? Try to fool one of the new guys. - The dwarf, maybe. - I'm begging you. Half of your commission. - You've got no heart, Savic. - Thanks. You can kiss self-management goodbye! Back to work, shit, now! Good luck, Savic. - Thank you. - Coffee... You shouldn't have... We filled everything in. - Bravo. - Wait! Where's my beer? The Slovenian guy is strict about it. Real asshole. But... I've got these. - Anything for the client. - This is good. - Dad, you're boozing again? - Omer, don't. Leave me alone. Shame on you. Spilling the booze, while children in Africa stay sober. Omer... Take mine. I'll lose my job. Look, now... We answered all your questions. I've got a question for you now. - Okay? - Okay. May 25th, 1995. Does this date tell you anything? - Omer, please, we're on a holiday... - Zip it. The Youth Day? Fifteen years since the death of Comrade Tito. - Bravo. That's right... - Mladen. - You did military service? - Back in 1988. Bravo. I served in 1980. The very year Comrade Tito died. - You watched the funeral? - Yes. During the funeral, we stood six hours in front of the TV. The whole company. Six hours. - Like this! - Take it easy. Like this... 'Ten-hut! The captain shouts: "Salute to the TV!" And for six hours, we salute the TV. Six hours, during the whole funeral. The whole company! But the soldiers start to fall. They pass out and fall. Belgrade boys, like you. You don't give a fuck the whole world came to pay respects to our Marshall! They went down already when Brezhnev was there. Before Todor Zhivkov. Nicolae Ceausescu. Erich Honecker, Sekou Toure, Hua Guofeng. Margaret Thatcher, Anwar El Sadat Saddam Hussein, God rest his soul, Indira Gandhi, and that Kraut... The German guy, Genscher, Helmut Schmidt. - Kenneth Kaundal. - Sit down, people stare. Great army story! I had a guy from Bosnia in my company, he was just like you. He could say "Long live the Communist party" while burping! At Kim Il-Sung, half of the company was down. The captain is almost gone.. But he is still on his feet. While I stand there... like a rock. Like a rock! Vacationing is not for such fools. Like a rock! Only a couple of us made it to the end of broadcast. Congratulations. The captain says it too, after the broadcast. He, himself soaked in sweat. But he says, - Baslagic... congratulations. - Are you done with this? - And I sit down. - Thank God. - He'll fuck up our business. - Wait! A fool like him is a real buyer. How about you, kid? Where did you serve? I skipped the Yugoslav Army because of the Croatian war. It's like you haven't lived at all. - I agree. - I sit down. But then... A rerun! I stand in attention, right away. I salute. The captain has no other option, he shouts, - Salute to... - To the TV! Bravo. You really fucked them up. Fucked them up? I fucked them up? That's how you see it? I was the last man standing at the end of the rerun. That's a joke for you? Belgrade boy... everything in life is just a joke for you. Everything. That is why you don't know what happened on May 25th, 1995. Be still! Be nice, hear me? I don't know. A shell, 130... a 130 mm shell. Straight at the town square. Full of young people. Your people fired it from the hills. My people? Seventy one killed, 150 wounded. Between 18 to 23 old. Don't be a mood killer. This one here, nagging about me killing the mood, on a fucking free holiday. She lost two of her cousins that day. Almost kids. Kids. Unlike you and me, they didn't know the drill command. “Atomic from the right”, means you have to jump for cover ta your left, and there was no one there to shout! Who would shout, anyway? Who would shout at the town square, like a fool? “Atomic from the right!” At the town square. You can't shout like that. Makes no sense. Scram, boy, go play. Stay in my sight, hear me? Makes no sense. Omer, please, we're on a holiday. Nothing will bring back my Saliha and Selima. - That's all Muslim propaganda... - Quiet down. Mother. Grown men always end up with army stories. How pathetic. But we, women, like to live in the real world. Right? There's something odd here. What's odd? Income. It doesn't match the number you gave at home. Come on, Sonja. Let me do my job. Sometimes, when people are on holiday, they get more relaxed, more... honest. Have some water. It will do you good. Lying about income could result in holiday cancellation. Our local field agents were clear about that. And you signed. I signed it. Take me, father. I want to draw some more. Fuck the vacation and everything. A perfect place for children, isn't it? Does it really have to be that way? It has to be! But then again, not. For some reason, this Serbian loser likes you. No one has to see this. Is this okay, Baslagic? Draw something. You want me to draw you? When you grow up. That's for big boys, only. Now sit here and think about it. I need your salesman for consultation. I'm sorry, urgent business. The bad cop role turns you on? No. I owed you this. Can we talk? This part really suits you. Well done! You've got a flat tire! Fucking whore! What does the lady boss say? Is she canceling us? No, she won't. I managed to reason with her. That's good. You've got two options, Omer. You can listen carefully to what I have to say about this special offer for a week in the VIP condo. - We will... - Or... I can tell you now what happened or. October 8th, 1991. What happened to me. I don't give a fuck about what happened to you. - Omer, please! - No F words, Daddy. I swear on my mother's grave. Scram now, bother someone else. Who can afford a house on the coast these days? - Only the crooks. - Only the crooks. Stupid stork. What are you drawing? Look at him... and that stupid haircut! Scram! Someday, my son will e grateful for this. I'm already grateful. You should be. Mothers are sacred. Skip the kiss. Die, you little brat! This is a full discount for two weeks. An honest, hard working man deserves even better than a house at the seaside. Thanks to... this, It's got air conditioning! Vacation in a resort that used to be reserved for foreign guests only. Do the nudist still come here? - Milena! - They used to come before the war. No, madam. We killed them all! I killed at least three of them! Just kidding. Maybe the monthly payment seems too large for you, but... You won't have to pay a single cent for a whole year. - Isn't that really... - We get what you're saying. Bur every couple has some priorities at the beginning. Maybe in a couple of years... A couple of years?! I'm sorry. I'm awfully sorry. Here... you have an option... To take a week every other year. That's not too much, is it? Do it for me. Please, take it. You'll save my life. Please... I'm begging you! On your fuckin' knees, crazy bitch. Losing a job at my age is... Aunt Olga, please don't. Still a lot of cash. How much is your commission? Ten percent? I can pay this, no problem. But to fuck you up a little is fun. Now you're going to suck my dick. He can't get it up, anyway. Is 2% enough for you? Shut up. I'm talking business! We're having a chat. - Sweets for them, too? - No, they're bad boys. So, how much does this week of yours cost? Your week. Maja. Ownership As long as you are alive. As long as your children are alive. Grandchildren and great-grandchildren. For the next 99 years. Man... if anyone in this country thought 99 years ahead, we'd never fought against each other. - Is this in Marks? - No, in peanuts. This kind of money you make only during the war. If you are a scumbag. Okay. But, if another war breaks out between us and this time you get rich, you'll look for me first about this deal, okay? I'll look for you anyway, Belgrade boy. Omer, stop it, will you? Can't you see we're kidding? Toasting with fucking water. - Cheers. - Cheers. In Bosnia, you'd call it a price for suckers. That's the right word. Would you be more interested if the price suits you? Well, it always comes down to money. - It's nice here. Right, Maja? - Yes, it is. Have you seen Svendy? He's here somewhere. Do you hear him? I do, but I have to find Svendy. Go, it's a man's job anyway. Have you seen my title boy? Small, chubby. Now, the best offer for a poor guy like me? - Free. - Free? That's a good one. Svendy, when I get hold of you... These Bosnians are fucking up our deal. I can't find him. I'll go look outside. Let me see it. Come on. Negotiations between Serbia and Bosnia are going well. Brotherhood and unity in business. That's what I call democracy. Bravo, Savic. Bravo! Twelve thousand? That's our secret. Savic is giving up the lion's share of his commission. A generous, good man. I know, but this is not a trifle, either. Not for a used car. But for a luxurious VIP condo? In Bosnia, you have a word for a respectable man? - The Chief. - Right. VIP, Chief. - Just like our Mladen, here. - Svendy! Who else in Tuzla owns a condo at an Adriatic resort? Not the one you stayed in. A much better condo! Do you know what VIP means? Fuck you and fuck VIP! He threw up! - I'll give my life for his! - Let them do their job! My son, my son. Our dear guests... Your attention, please! Everything will be just fine with the little boy and the Baslagic family will join us in no-time. What are you talking about?! The child just tumbled down four meters! To fall and bleed is nothing to a child! We've got important business to do! Business? The ambulance just took a child, you heartless prick! The kid was a real pain in the ass, still... Assholes make children, but they can't take care of them. Why haven't you taken security measures... To express our care for your well-being, we're serving right now a buffet with Adriatic cuisine. Just keep it coming. Come on. Barbarians! They will never learn manners. Uncivilized pricks! You simply have to try this. Get away from me! All of you, get away from me! I'm sorry! I'm so sorry, please... Jesus Christ... Of all the fly-bys, getting screwed by a fly-boy. Has anyone made a deal yet? A week, with a discount. - Beginner's luck. - I'll drink to that. Two weeks. VIP. No discount. How about our salesman of the year? Two things set so far. You... and him. Fuck these long faces! We still got a job. Today! Back to work! Move! Olga... From zero to hero, don't forget that. Look... he drew us all. How much do you owe the bank? Three grand, for the past three months. You bought your mother a place in Beverly Hills? A small flat. In downtown Belgrade. The Communists threw her family out of the building. I knew she'd like to die in the place where she was born. Four grand per square meter. You can't expect an ex-junkie to act rationally. I'll go check on the kid. This is yours. You're the best salesman I've ever met. On your feet. May I have your attention, please? Our friend is going to the hospital, from there, he will inform us about little Svendy and about his dear parents. Way to go, young man! He will have some great news for us very soon! From those 100 Euros buy some fruit for the kid. Dude, I have to work. - Hey, say hello from me. - Good luck, Savic. If I said something wrong.. It's for your own good! I am a mother! I had to lie because of you! - I have a baby! - I have a discount. Discount! I'm a lousy mother, wasting my time here! Walking down the beach, gathering shells! Rubbing myself with oil! I should rub shit on me! Go ahead, throw me out of here! I want to go home. Right. Okay... Fuck, dude, the old hag totally lost it! We're totally fucked up! Just give me that stuff you've got. Dude, I can't Can't you see I'm fucked up? I gotta pull myself together! Dude, you fucking got me now! Here, a bonus... Montblanc. We're going home. - They gave him a CAT scan. - Yes, scan. He didn't even get to swim in the sea. All the time he drew the sea. And these bloody birds. What do the doctors say? Badly bruised, but thank God, nothing broken. Good. I mean... that's good. That's good. Thanks for coming. Excuse me. What the fuck... Hi, Mom. I'm not working, go ahead. Let them call. Don't talk to them. Tell them to call me. Yes... and, Mom... If those people come there, don't let them in. Even if they look like nice people. There are no nice people in the bank. I gotta go now. Bye. Problems? Yes... sort of. I hope you don't mind. I'm just... Trying to take my mind off this... What was the story you wanted to tell me? When I bored you to death? You bored him, alright, That thing, in 1991. What was that? Where? Vukovar, Croatian war. When I look at you, I'd say that all your life you just chase pussy. Well, that was the original plan, but... It seems the Army had other plans for me. The military police picked us up in the middle of the night. Me and my brother. You don't look like a volunteer, anyway. Fuck man, I don't. Half of Belgrade boys slept every night at a different place. Hiding from the mobilization. When they finally caught us and put us on a truck for the war zone, he told me that he actually knew they were coming for us, Moron. He didn't want to tell me. He knew I'd run. What can I tell you? He wasn't the only one who acted like that. It was like... we lost it. So? How long did you fight? Eleven days. - Wow, a true warrior. - We got information... that they were forming a firing squad out of recruits. To shoot the prisoners... and civilians. I didn't plan it to be this way, but I got drunk as a skunk. My hand shook a little when I fired. I aimed at the pinky toe. Fuck... I almost lost my foot. A real, fine wound. But the pinky toe made it through the war. That's not funny. - Well, it is. - Here it is... like new. How about your brother? Let's forget these silly army stories. Baslagic. It's still critical. Critical? You said nothing's broken. The CT showed something we call cerebral edema. You said bruises and... The fall caused a blood vessel rupture and swelling of the tissue. Blood vessel... in his head? He'll get corticosteroids for the swelling, but we have to open the skull to give the tissue some space. Please, don't open my child's brain. I don't want that... You have to sign this consent form. - Do you understand me? - Wait a minute. You said nothing's broken, just bruises. Fuck this! I'll go get him! Mr. Baslagic! If we don't do this, you'll lose your child. Omer... Sign it. Trust him. I'll sign it. Let it be. Just save him, please. We are wired to the PA, our thoughts are with you and the Baslagic family. How is our little Svendy? Sonja, the kid is... He'll be alright... we hope. Little Svendy is alright! That's not what I said, that's not... Sonja! There's more! Our lovely Baslagic couple have decided to buy a week right here, in Flamingo, because little Svendy deserves this. Little Svendy... will have here a safe place to stay! I hope that all of you will join this brave family. From zero to hero... discount. From zero to hero... discount. From zero to hero... I have to go now. See you at the hotel. Mladen? Sit with us. Please. Come here. You heard what the doctor said. If everything turns out fine, Svendy would like to come here for the summer, wouldn't he? You said it yourself. It's perfect for kids. We'd like to have another look at the contract. To think about it. It must be in your briefcase. Why would you think I'd have the contract? Because you have the briefcase. - Sonja, the kid is not alright! - Is he alive? - Yes, but they will open his... - Great! People just sign, no questions asked. This is the best presentation ever! You've done a miracle. For you, for me. For all of us. And we've made it through this fucking day just because of you. For how much did you rip off those Bosnians? You can tell me. Two weeks, at least? Why do you go on vacation? Because... Because you want to relax. Right? - Right. - Yes. Bravo! After ten years of vacationing, what can you show? What? A bunch of old photos in a shoe box. And memories... ever fading memories. There's nothing you can do about it. What about the money you've spent in those places? What about the money? Where is the money? It's gone. You left it at all those fucking places that you've been in. - Right? - Right. So, it's gone. It's spent. Gone. This... you've got this at home. Condos for ordinary people. But this! You've seen something like this only on TV and celebrity magazines. Right? But why Omer and Maja wouldn't go on the same vacation as... Bono Vox, or... - Angelina Jolie. - Right! And a couple of others, too. Are Omer and Maja any worse than those people in the magazines? Are they? The answer is... no! They're not. You can take your friends with you. You can have a good time with them, have a barbecue. You can even charge them! - To charge our friends?! - Of course! It looks exciting... it looks appealing. But... "it's too expensive”, you say to yourself. "Can I afford this?” Probably not. Forget it This is not just for anyone. - But we didn't say anything. - Yes, you did. I heard you. Here, But 'can I afford this' is not the real question here. Because money's got nothing to do with this! This is the real question. "Will I settle for petty things for the rest of my life?" "Will I pick leftovers for the rest of my life?” "Do these leftovers define my whole life?" And the mother of all questions. "Do I have the guts to take the responsibility for my own life?" That is the real question here. Today, you have the chance to step into a new period of your lives. Recognize that chance. Grab it. Give me the pen. I gave away my lucky pen. Omer, wait. Before you sign... Take a look at this. It says that you have to pay the annual maintenance fee. It's 350 Euros. Do I have to pay now, in cash? Wait. Take a look at this. You can lose the right of ownership if one year you miss to pay the annual maintenance fee. - Do you have 350 Euros on you? - Here. Here it is. But you tell them to paint the walls right now. I want my Svendy to stay in a neat room. Painted in yellow! He loves yellow, draws it everywhere. The Sun should shine on everything, he says. My clever boy. Here. Omer, don't buy this. This is not for you, man. We're not good enough for this?! For my Svendy, anything! My Svendy is not good enough for this?! Do you hear me?! You said, what can you show after all those years of vacations? Just a bunch of family photos! I don't want to show just a bunch of photos! I don't! - Give me that pen! - Give it. Look at this, a fountain pen. You managers are well off. I haven't seen this since the elementary school. I learned to write with a fountain pen. With a ballpoint pen you just spoil the handwriting. - Where do I sign? - Here. Come here. Here we are In the jaws of changing times You are turning into "You" While we are turning into a bunch of old jerks Etiquette, conscience and solidarity Stilt turn us on Better a natural balcony Than plastic popularity The comic books generation Drinking cold beer Happy for no reason We are still alive What would we do without dreams? Without our voice? What would we do without love? What would we do without us? What would we do without dreams? Without our voice? What would we do without love? What would we do without us? We used to be the New Wave Furious friends making music Dancing the last ball Playing the sharp guitar We wanted a better world Then the money ran out And the good bunny Turned into a fierce hunter The comic books generation Drinking cold beer Happy for no reason We are still alive What would we do without dreams? Without our voice? What would we do without love? What would we do without us? What would we do without dreams? Without our voice? What would we do without love? What would we do without us?
