[SILENCE] [MUFFLED VOICES ARGUING IN SPANISH] [VOICES CONTINUE] [MUFFLED SLAP, CRYING] [MUFFLED ARGUMENT CONTINUES] [STRANGE GROWLING] [VOICES CRYING] [TWO GUNSHOTS] It's an awfully nice house. Unfortunately it's empty. Your aunt was planning to sell it just before she passed away. Un... fucking... believable! You own this? Your house has a fountain. What's it feel like to have a house that has a fountain? You're going to have one hell of a water bill, that's for sure. This place is out of control. You know what you need? A roommate. No, thanks. How are you gonna afford this place all by yourself? Come on Mark, you know it's already paid for. Just think about it. The parties we could throw here. Whoa! Who's this piece of ass? That's my ex-wife. Oh, I'm sorry, man. She's beautiful. Who took those? I did. They're good. Yeah well, I don't do it anymore. Why? I used to take pictures all the time. Anything that seemed interesting. You know, anything that would catch my eye. Then I met her. Didn't care to shoot anything else. She was your muse. Hey man, I appreciate you helping me move. I should probably start unpacking. You got this? I got it. All right. Are you good? - Yeah, I'm good. You sure? I'm fine. All right, tomorrow we blow some of that money and turn this place into a proper bachelor pad. Then we line it wall to wall with pussy. Trust me bro, it's the universal cure-all. Does wonders for a broken heart. I'm out. [GIRL HUMMING] [HUMMING] Hello. Hi. What are you doing here? I live here. No you don't. The lady who lived here died. There you are. Oh. Hi. I didn't realize someone moved in. That's my daughter Rebecca and I'm Rachel. We just live right up the road. I'm Eddie. Honey, you can't keep coming here like this. Why? Because they don't live here anymore. The lady that lived here would let her play on the swing. She passed away. She was my aunt. Oh, I'm so sorry. Thank you. Welcome to the neighborhood. Honey, we'd better get going because your daddy's gonna come and pick you up. I'll make sure she doesn't bother you anymore. Oh, it's no bother, really. That's really nice of you. Thank you. Have a great night, okay? - You too. - Okay. Come on honey, it is so cold. You should put this on, okay? Baby girl, there you go. Wait. Oh look baby, you almost forgot your book. Thank you. You're welcome. - Bye. - Bye. Hello? Hey. Eddie? How are ya? It's 4 o'clock in the morning. Oh shit. I'm sorry. I guess I must have just forgotten about the time difference. Are you drunk? Hey, you remember that, that beautiful green dress? Would you believe that it got mixed up in my stuff? Is that why you're calling at this hour? Well, I called to say hi. You've gotta stop this. You said we'd be friends, so I'm being friendly. We need time. We can't be friends now. What the fuck? [INDISTINCT MAN'S VOICE] Everything's fine. Go back to sleep. Lisa, who's there? I'm sorry. Don't call me anymore. Lisa! Fuck! Fuck! If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again. If you need help, hang up and then dial-- Fuck! [CRYING] [DOORBELL RINGS] Hey, motherfucker! I'm here. It's fucking cold outside. Come on, man. Eddie. Eddie. Eddie! Jesus, fuck. Eddie, what the fuck did you do? It was just too many things at once. My mom, my girlfriend, my job. At the time, I didn't see myself recovering from so much loss. I didn't see the point in going on. Yeah but a lot's changed since then, right? Do you want to share with us? Yeah. I've got a new job at Pete's Hardware, making more money than before. And Beth and I are talking again. So I guess I'm hopeful. That's great. We're all happy for you, right? Does anybody wanna share about Vincent's progress? [CHUCKLING] Yeah, I'm going to say something right now. I think he's being stupid. [LAUGHS] Let's think about it here, I mean, his bitch left him after his mom died and he lost his job. You should go tell her to fuck herself man, fuck that bitch. You don't know all the details so you're in no position to judge. Okay, on that note, let's take a break and come back in ten. Eddie. Sorry man, we started without you. Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt. You're not interrupting anything. I invited you here. This is your surprise. Astrid, Eddie. Eddie, Astrid. Mark tells me you're a photographer. I took some courses, but you know, I'm no photographer. Bullshit. You should see some of his stuff. I'd love to. No. Really I should go. You should sit. Mark, please. Sit. Eddie, it's been really slow at the studio, it would be really cool if you came by and checked things out. You know, I'm just busy. Doing what? Doing stuff, Mark. Like what? Look, it's okay. But if you decide you want to come by, the offer still stands. I should go though. Absolutely not. Your money's no good here. I told you, this was my treat. Thank you. It was very nice to meet you, Eddie. - What did you do that for? - What did you do that for? I just that it'd be nice if you got out and did something for once. It wouldn't kill you to get laid, either. Mark, I don't need you to be my matchmaker. Fine. Sorry. It won't happen again. I've been thinking. It's been so many years. He's moved who knows where. Probably done it to a bunch of other kids. Probably forgotten all about me. And if he's forgotten, then I'm the one that's keeping it alive, you know? So it made sense what you said. I can give it power, or I can take it away. And I choose to take it away. Right. How does that make you feel? Good, good. Thank you, Patrick. I know that wasn't easy. Does anybody else wanna share something about themselves tonight? Amy, how about you? Would you like to share with the group? Okay, you don't have to. That's bullshit right there. Patrick, that's not how we do things here. She's been coming here for weeks. She hasn't said a goddamn word. You know how hard it was for me to tell you people what that man did to me? Patrick, you know we don't pressure people here. I don't like people knowing my shit when I don't know theirs. That's not what it's about. It's about trust. Trust takes time. And it takes more time for some of us than it does for others. Amy will share in her own time, okay? Is there anybody else who'd like to share? Eddie? Would you like to share? It's okay. You're amongst friends here. Yeah. My wife divorced me. And I don't blame her. I wasn't easy. Relationships are hard, they take a lot of work. Yeah, but, I... I have issues. Why do you think it was you that was the problem? I always left the light on at night. She hated it. Are you afraid of the dark? Yes. There's no shame in that. Is it the darkness, or is it what you can't see in the darkness that scares you? The last time I was in complete darkness... ...I was just a boy. My parents were arguing. [MUFFLED VOICES ARGUING IN SPANISH] They were always arguing. This time it was different. She wasn't the same. [WOMAN WAILING] My dad was pleading for us. Then I heard my sister. [GIRL SPEAKING SPANISH] And two more gunshots. [GUNSHOTS] I knew my sister was dead. I heard the door to my room open. I heard her footsteps as she drew closer. Mama. Mama. [SPEAKING SPANISH] Eddie. Hey. Hi. That was something, huh? I'm Amy. Yeah, I know. I'm Eddie. Yeah, I know. You wanna get something to eat? Did your mom really do that? Why would I make that up? Be surprised the things people say for attention. I'm not looking for attention. How did it end? She walked into my room, and put two bullets in my chest. That was the last time I saw my mother. What happened to her? I don't know, I woke up in a hospital a month later. My aunt raised me until I went off to college. That's heavy. Do you want to go back to my place? What is this place? Home sweet home. There's no way. This place looks abandoned. It's not. Come on I'll show you. What's the matter? Can you turn on a light? There's no electricity. You live here without electricity? Yeah, without A/C, heat, or running water either. Come on. Look, I don't do well in the dark. Look, it's dark. Are you scared? No. How come? I don't know. Because you know you're safe with me. Come on. Look, I can't go any further. But we're almost there, it's just up ahead. No, seriously. I can't. I just can't. Besides, it's really cold in here. Why don't we just go back to my place. Okay. Just give me a minute. I need to grab something, stay here. What? No I can't. Relax, gimme your phone. There, now you have a light. Stay here. [RUSTLING] Is that you? [NOISES, WHISPERING] Jesus! You scared the fuck out of me! I'm sorry. You okay? - Yeah. Let's get out of here. [EDDIE BREATHING HEAVILY] Home sweet home. It's not furnished but at least it's warm. Don't. You know I don't do well in the dark. Please leave it off. You're safe with me. Are you still afraid of the dark little boy? No. So do you really live in that horrible place? This isn't exactly the Waldorf. At least it's a proper house. It needs work. Well you know I have a lot of space. Are you asking me to move in with you? Yeah I guess I am. I hope you're not just saying that in the hopes that I'm gonna politely decline. No, I'm not. Okay. Okay. Amy! Amy! Amy! Amy! Amy. What? Why don't you tell me anything? There's a lot I haven't told you. Why don't you get some help? A grown man afraid of the dark telling me I need help? I'm an asshole. I want to kick. I'm just so tired of clinics and doctors fucking with my head. Why don't you help me? I wouldn't know what to do. What's to know? People go cold turkey all the time. You just gotta break on through, you know? What if something happens? What's gonna happen? I'll get my things. I'm sorry I bothered you. Wait. I'll help you. [GASPS] [OMINOUS AMBIENCE] [STRANGE GROWLING] [CRIES OUT] Amy. Amy. Amy. [INDISTINCT DIALOGUE] [CRYING] [EERIE WHISPERING] [SILENCE] [BIRDS CHIRPING] She's pretty. My ex-wife. A woman worth dying for. I see it, though. I can see where someone would become obsessed. I wasn't obsessed, I was in love. Love, obsession, what's the difference? It's viral. One minute you're fine, next thing you know you're infected with someone and you can't function without them, you'd risk everything for them. She was my best friend. She knew me better than I knew myself. Nobody really knows anyone. These aren't bad. Did you take these? Yeah. I want you to see me like this. Will you take my picture? Were you sleeping? It's barely seven o'clock. Dude, it's a bad time. A bad time? Yeah, I've got a friend over. You don't have any friends. Have you got a chick in there? Who is it? It's a friend. Fuck you, who is it? Amy. You don't know her. Where'd you meet her? I met her at therapy. That can't be healthy. Whatever. So I'll come back later. Well she's actually kind of staying here. Staying here? Yeah, she's kind of homeless. Homeless? Dude, she was squatting in an abandoned building, I couldn't leave her there. What? Your best friend asks you to stay here in your big fucking palace and you say no you need your space. And some little hood rat shakes her tail in your face and you roll out the red carpet for her? I see how it is. Wait, are you fucking with me? You know what? Have your fun but remember, rats carry disease. Careful you don't catch something. Mark - Bon appetit. Mark! Come on. Good night! Where's the girl? What? The girl, Amy, where is she? Who are you? My name is Gabriel, but that's not important. What is important is that you tell me where Amy is. Look, man, I don't know who you are or what you're talking about-- You know exactly who I'm talking about. Why have you taken her? You better back off, man. You don't have any idea what you've gotten yourself into. Have you been intimate with her? What? All right, listen, man, you better stay the fuck away from me. Listen to me, you fool. No, you listen to me. Don't make me hurt you. You're in grave danger, and I'm trying to help you. Is Amy still on the drugs? Stay away. Whatever happens, make sure she stays on the drugs. Just stay away. Do you know a Gabriel? No, why? Well I had an interesting conversation with a man today. He said his name was Gabriel. He said he knew you. He seemed to know a lot about you. What'd he say? He wanted to know where you were and he also said that I was in danger. Really, how so? I don't know, we really didn't get that far. He got a little aggressive so I told him to go fuck himself. He also knew about your little drug problem. What? I'm sorry, I just find it hard to believe that you don't know this guy. You think I'm lying to you? Well, I don't think you're being completely honest with me. What? [EERIE WHISPERS] [ROARING GASPS] [DEMONIC GRUNTING] [EDDIE CRIES OUT] [GASPS] Amy, Amy! Amy, wake up. Amy! Wake up! - What? Look. What the fuck? You hurt? No, I don't think so. What? Stop, Jesus, relax, I'm fine. Where did this come from? I don't know. Just relax. Are you-- Are you? No! Are you sure? I would know if I was on my fucking rag. Where the fuck did this come from then? How should I know? Just fucking calm down. Hey. Aah! [SCREAMS] Son of a bitch! Hey, seen Bailey? My dog. You all right? Have a good night. [WHISTLING] Come on Bailey. Let's go home, boy. Are you looking for me? Come on. This used to be department store before the economy tanked and it closed down. Changed hands so many times, everybody seemed to wanna do something different with it. Previous owner, they gutted it really badly. The new owner, she rents it to me. And although it's not a proper studio, you will see that it gives me all the space I need to create. Wow. Have a look around. So what do you think? They're amazing, it's just a little shocking that's all. May I? Yeah, that's why I brought them. You're really good. It was a good camera. I've seen some god awful pictures taken with a good camera. Have you ever used one of these before? No, I've seen them but I've never use one. You should try it. I'll teach you. So do you wanna use it? Huh? The studio. You said, you might wanna use it. Yeah, I wanna photograph a friend and in a more controlled environment. Cool, when? At your convenience. I mean, I know you're busy, so I don't wanna put you out. I wish. Pick any night next week. Eddie? Who is this? That's Gabriel. He's kind of a recluse. He works at the service station at the edge of town. Kind of a strange cat, but he's harmless. Eddie, are you okay? Oh my God, I'm sorry. It's okay, stop. You're gonna cut yourself. I can't believe I did that, it's your work. It's all right, it's just the frame. Eddie, you're bleeding. Come on. What happened? I don't know. It looked like you were having a seizure. Are you epileptic? No, no, nothing like that. Are you sick? There's a bug going around, you know? No, just, I haven't been sleeping well, bad dreams. What kind of dreams? Well, it's strange. It's more like episodes rather than dreams. How so? It's like I wake up in my bed. I'm in my room. I can see everything around me, but I can't move. I can't speak. I can feel things in the darkness, I can hear things, voices. It's called a hypnopompic state. A what? Postdormital sleep paralysis, you regain consciousness while your body's sleep mechanism is still engaged. They're two main states of consciousness. You're wide awake, or you're sleep. When you're asleep, you're essentially paralyzed. Say, you're dreaming and you're in a fight. This is what keeps you from punching your lover sleeping next to you. Sometimes, however, we become conscious while the sleep mechanism is still engaged. It's like a waking dream. Your mind is wide awake, but your body's still asleep. Yeah, that makes sense. How do you know so much about this? I have a morbid fascination with the occult. What does this have to do with the occult? Be grateful you're not living in the Middle Ages. You'd be diagnosed with the early stages of demonic possession. All right, now you're creeping me out. I should probably go. Yeah, I'll walk you out. Is that okay? Oh yeah, it's great. Thanks. Listen, I'm sorry about today. No, don't worry about it. It's okay, really. Thanks. So, next week then? Oh, yeah right. Yeah, I'll give you a call and we'll make a plan. Yeah, that sounds good. Cool, good night. Good night. Hey, would you like to go have a drink some time? I think it'd be really nice for us to chat again. I'm sorry. I'm sort of seeing someone. I should have-- Yeah. I knew that. Yeah, this is really awkward. I feel really stupid - No don't please don't really. I should have said something. I'm sorry. No, don't worry about it. Have a good night. [EERIE WHISPERS] What are you doing? Amy, honey, you're freaking me out. [CRIES OUT] [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Everything all right in there? We thought we heard a scream. Yeah, I was having a bad dream. It's like 1 p.m. Must be nice. It was a late night. What can I do for you guys? I'm Detective Warner. The big guy here is Detective McConnell. We were hoping to ask you a few questions. Yeah sure. What's this about? Mind if we come in? Honey, Amy wake up. The cops are here. Cops? Why? So moving huh? Looks like you got more space than stuff. Yeah, I guess. You two married? No, no. We're just friends. Can somebody please tell me what's going on here? It's okay, Eddie, relax. Say, do you recognize this girl? Yeah. I forget her name. She's the girl that lives right up the street. Rebecca Green. How exactly do you know her? I don't. I met her the day that I moved in. Did something happen? That's what we're trying to figure out. Turns out she came up missing. Well, that's terrible. Yeah, it is. When was the last time you saw her? The day I moved in she was playing in my back yard on the swing. What date was that? What date exactly? I-I don't know. I can't remember. I'll have to check. Anything out of the ordinary? Anything suspicious in the last couple of days? No, nothing that I can think of. How did you two meet? We met in group therapy. So then you two dating? No, just fucking. Okay. Well, I think that pretty much covers it. But if you can think of anything else, just give us a call at that number. Have a good afternoon. Thanks ma'am. Have a good afternoon. That was weird. What? What's that? - A book. I mean, where'd it come from? How should I know? It's your house. Hi there, I was just setting up. I thought this would look cool. It looks great. It's good to see you. You must be Amy. Well, should we go get you all dolled up? I guess I'll set something up here. You should do that. Have a seat. Have you ever done any modeling? Really? That's a shame. You have a great face. You're shy? All right. You're a woman of few words. You want him, don't you? What? Look. I thought he was cute when he was so vulnerable. I'm a sucker for that. Anyway, he said that he was seeing someone so I left it alone. I'm not trying to start shit. I mean that. All set. Thanks a lot for your help. You look great. What are you gonna wear? Oh shit! The fuse. I'm really sorry. I'll be right back. Shit. Eddie, you scared me. Wait, she's just right up stairs. [SCREAMS] Astrid. What happened? Astrid. Jesus Christ, talk to me. What happened? It was her. I thought it was you, but it was her. Listen. She's dangerous, you have to get away from her. What? I have to go. Astrid, wait, I don't understand. I have to go! What just happened? What the fuck happened? I have no clue man. What'd she say? She said you made a pass at her. Then your girlfriend made a pass at her. And then your girlfriend got all fucking crazy. She's not making any sense. Jesus. What happened? Look I was taking pictures of Amy, but the light goes out, so Astrid goes down to check on the fuses, next thing I know I just hear a scream. I go down and check up on her, she's crying hysterically. So I try to calm her down, she takes one look at Amy, and just storms out the fucking building, man, that's all I know. It's crazy. Look, there's something really weird going on. What do you mean? The other day, the cops came by my place asking questions. Turns out there's a little girl in the neighborhood missing. Well, guess what? I found her book in my house. How do you know it's her book? Because I've met her once. She would come by, sit on the swing and read. I know it was hers, man. I saw it. Doesn't mean anything. She could have left it there. It's not just that. Ever since she's moved in I've been having these really crazy dreams. The other morning I wake up and our fucking bed is covered in blood and neither of us is hurt. Then I walk to the yard and my neighbor's dog is just torn to fucking pieces. Do you think Amy-- I'm-- Just last week, this guy who I've never seen before walks up to me in the middle of the street and starts asking me about her. Then he tells me that I'm in danger. Who was it? Who gives a shit, man? The point is that I'm freaked the fuck out. I can't even sleep at night. I don't wanna go home. Are you fucking kidding me? I wish I was. That's your big fucking house, man. I know. Tell her to get the fuck out. - I can't, Mark. - Why? Because I don't want to see her. She scares me. Man, I told you not to get involved! Don't! I don't need that from you right now. Sorry, you're right. Do you want me to talk to her? - No. - Why not? I'll tell that little bitch to pack her bags. Look I just need you to be my friend right now. Okay, I gotta get back to work. You go to my place, get some sleep, we'll figure this out later, okay? You look like shit. Thanks. Eddie's not home. Yeah, I know. [QUIET MUSIC PLAYING ON COMPUTER] [THUMP] [MUSIC TURNS DOWN] Hello? [EERIE WHISPERS] [SCREAMS] [SCREAMING] [MUFFLED] Eddie, wake up. Easy, easy, easy! Relax! It was just a bad dream. It's just a dream. - Thanks. - You all right? Yeah, what time is it? It's about nine. Why didn't you sleep in the bed? I don't wanna put you out. You look like you could use a beer. You went and saw Amy, didn't you? I asked you not to. Sorry man, I couldn't just stand by and watch some crazy bitch put my best friend out of his own home. What did she say? - She'll be gone by the time you get back. You can sleep here tonight. I really need to see Astrid. Not a good idea. I feel terrible. How do you think I feel? I introduced you to her. Give it some time man. You guys really freaked her out. I didn't do anything. Give it some time anyway. You wanna watch some tv? I'm sorry, man. Get some sleep, we'll figure this out later. Well, hello again, Mr. Marquez. We didn't wake you, did we? What can I do for you? Your cell is a 646 number, correct? Yeah, it's a New York line. Do you know an Astrid Flowers? Yeah, why? Exactly what is your relationship with Ms. Flowers? She's my friend. Why? Can you account for your whereabouts between the hours of 7 and 10 p.m. last night? I was at my friend Mark's. Mark, what was his last name? Mark Gaines. Can somebody please tell me what's going on here? Astrid Flowers was found raped and murdered in her studio this morning. We're genuinely sorry to bring you such terrible news like this. But when was the last time you saw Ms. Flowers? Mr. Marquez? I'm sorry, I saw her a couple days ago. She let us use her studio. Us? Yeah, me and my friend Amy. Your girlfriend? She's not my girlfriend. But she lives with you? No, she doesn't live here anymore. You guys break up? Look, am I under suspicion or something? Why would you come to me? In cases like these, we can't afford to leave any stone unturned. Your number came up on a list of calls to Miss Flowers. We're just checking it out, Eddie. Standard procedure, I assure you. Thank you very much for your time. You're not planning on traveling any time soon, are you, Mr. Marquez? No, no. Good. Have a nice day. So what do you think? I think that's our boy. Hello. Mark. Astrid's dead, dude. The cops came by and they think that I did it, man. Fooled you! Ha ha! Leave a message. You're so gullible, I can't believe you fell for that. God damn it, Mark, answer your God damn phone! Are you ready to hear me now? She's been looking for you for a long time. For me? Someone like you. Damaged. What do you know about me? It's a small town, Eddie. When one of its own comes back after 20 years... and tries to kill himself, people talk. I know all about you. I know about your family. And I know what your mother did. What does this have to do with Amy? Everything. Are you gonna tell me what's going on? Amy... is a conduit. A conduit? A spiritual channel, a gateway to a dark evil that exists only to possess and destroy. I don't believe in that shit. Yes, you do. You've seen it. You felt it and that's why you came looking for me. What does this have to do with me? I think it's a crack in your psyche, that's what's attracted Amy to you. She's drawing you in, bonding with you. Intimately, carnally. Trying to pass this thing off, like a disease. What thing? A demon. A demon? Amy grew up in a small town not far from here. Her family, they were members of the local congregation. Good churchgoing people. Church is a big deal in these small towns, isn't it, Eddie? But she was different from the other girls. Blossoming almost before she was aware of it. But the men, the men in town, they were aware of it. Including the parish priest. His faith was no match for the lust that she inspired in him. He seduced her. The old fool, he fell in love with her. And Amy, she too soon fell in love with one of the local boys. The priest, he was insane with jealousy. He threatened to tell Amy's parents. But Amy, she threatened to expose the priest, how he had seduced her, how they had been carrying on for months. It would ruin him. So the priest, he concocted a truly wicked plan. He told Amy's parents about her and the boy. But he said that Amy was not of her right mind. That she had been touched by evil, that she was possessed. And the simpletons bought it. And they agreed to an exorcism. Mommy. Mommy, no more. Hush, baby. It will be over soon. Daddy? Silence, unclean spirit. You cannot fool us, for we have come in the name of the one true God, by whose authority we will cast you out of this servant of the Lord. No, no more. Let us begin. Christ have mercy. - Stop it. - Christ have mercy. - Stop it. There's nothing wrong with me. - Christ hear us. Christ graciously hear us. God the father in heaven - Have mercy on us. God, son, redeemer of the world. - It was him, it was him! - Pray for us. - Holy orders of blessed spirits. - Pray for us. It was him. He fucked me. He did it to me. He's the fucking devil. Silence, purveyor of lies! Hold your forked tongue. Do not attempt to sully the sanctity of this most holy ceremony with your vile blasphemies. No, no, no, no! No! No! - She must be restrained. No, please let me go! No, no! - Pray for us! - Saint Andrew. - Let me go! - Pray for us! - Saint James. - Pray for us! - St. John. - Pray for us! - Saint Thomas. - Pray for us! Saint Phillip. Saint Bartholomew. Saint Matthew. Saint Simon. No. [DEMONIC VOICE] No! [GRUNTS] And when it was over, the beautiful and vibrant child was gone. And in her place, an angry and brooding young woman. Prone to terrible, terrible fits of violence. Then one by one, her family all started dying under mysterious circumstances. For years, Amy was tormented. And then she turned to drugs, the harder the better. And it seemed to help. The demon didn't seem to be able to take control amid all the fog. And then you came along. I was just trying to help her. And in return, she's trying to destroy you. Well, if what you're saying is true, I have to go and find her. No, Eddie. What you need to do is put as much distance as you can between you and Amy. Look. They think I killed Astrid Flowers. I can't run now. I have to go find Amy and prove my innocence. Eddie, nothing can be gained from this. It may already be too late for you. Look, more reason for me to go and find her. Get out of my way. Eddie! Eddie! Eddie! Check it out. Merry fucking Christmas. Eddie Marquez, you're under arrest. For what? For the murder of Astrid Flowers and Mark Gaines. No, I didn't do it. Okay, then you've got nothing to worry about, son. Put your hands on the back of your head and get down on the ground. I'm unarmed. You can't shoot me. God damnit. You got nowhere to go, Eddie. Who's there? Show yourself. I will shoot you. Eddie? Eddie, is that you? Amy, where are you? I know you're in here. Come out, god dammit! Dear God. [GROWL] [CRIES OUT] Dave! What the fuck? [DEMONIC VOICE] Amy! What do you want? [DEMONIC VOICE] What have you done? Whatever do you mean? What have you done to me? You know better than to sleep around. What, did you catch something? Why, Amy? I tried to help you. Because the mess your mommy left inside your head made it really easy. I've dealt with this shit for a long time. Now it's your problem. Congratulations. You bitch! I've been called worse. Bye, now. [EDDIE GROWLS] [AMY CRIES OUT] What did you do to my best friend? Are you kidding me? What did you do?! - I didn't lay a finger on him. - Liar! I swear, I didn't touch him. They're going to think I killed them all! What about that little girl, huh? The two cops that followed you in, haven't heard from them in a while. What the fuck are you? What the fuck are you? [GROWLING] For 15 years I've tried to make it right, Eddie! I've tried to protect her. I've tried to protect the world from her. What I did was wrong, Eddie, I can't undo that. But if you kill me, the blood will bind you together. You'll never be free. He is bound. It was you. No, Eddie, dear God. [ROARS]
