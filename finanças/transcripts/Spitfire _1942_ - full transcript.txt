David Niven liked to have you believe that acting was just a matter of turning up on time, knowing your lines, and trying not to trip over the furniture. The fact is that he was an accomplished and stylish star. Making light of his talent was the source of most of his funny stories. Some of them borrowed, others heavily retouched, but all told with grace and gusto. As somebody once said, rather than answer a question, he puts on a floor show. He obviously wanted, perhaps needed, to please, and unfailingly did, not just in more than 80 films and countless conversations, but in his books too. Here from our many recorded interviews with him over the years, some of which I very much enjoyed doing, are a few reminders of what good company he was. On take one, Mr. David Niven. Mr. Niven, studying your life stories, I'm just staggered at the number of things you've done. And I can't help feeling that you must be the black sheep of your family. Are you? I really left the army because I cheated at golf. This is what really happened. And I used to play golf very well. And my colonel played very badly. And his name was Topher Smollett. He put me under arrest once for calling him Topher Smollett. Anyway, he used to make me play golf with him. He was very, very bad indeed. I was dying to get to London. I was courting this beautiful girl. And I used to beat him, I mean, so easily, sort of eight up and six. I mean, it's a shame. To this day, he said, well, we play the bye. We had to finish another-- Ah, hacking around this course. Princes, I think it was. No, by deal. And quite by mistake, I got in an immense bunker. And so the caddys knew I was in a hurry. He said, I've got a wonderful idea. So you Chuck the ball up on the green. I'll throw up a handful of sand. So that sounds all right. So I threw the ball up on the green. And he threw up a handful of sand to make the shot look all right. And the colonel was looking over the back. And he saw this. And he was absolutely white with rage. And I was not the sort of man he wanted in the regiment. I mean, there was no question. I had to go. From England, Niven escaped to New York. He was in his early 20s. He had friends, contacts, and enthusiasm. But he was broke. And I went to New York. I went down to New York. And I got a job selling booze. This was just after Prohibition. And all the bootleggers were becoming wine merchants. And my beat was Second Avenue, which is the roughest part. And I had this terrible bag of samples. And I lived in an old hotel called the Montclair. And the Montclair Hotel, the front door of the Montclair Hotel was exactly opposite the back door of the Waldorf, this huge hotel. And I was rather sad. So every morning, I used to appear with my samples, come out of the front door of the Montclair, cross Lexington Avenue, go up the steps at the back of the Waldorf, go through these great gilded lobbies of the Waldorf, down the steps under Park Avenue, where the doorman, who thought I lived there, would say, good morning, Mr. Niven. I'd say, good morning, Charles. And I'd go off with this bag of booze. Back down to these terrible bars and places and sell nothing. Come back at the end of the day. Evening, sir, have a good day, yes, thank you, Charles. Up the things, through the Waldorf, down the other side, and went to ground like a ghastly fox in this place. And I lost that job. The staggering fact about you when your film career eventually started is that you started as an extra, as Anglo-Saxon type 2008 or something. Anglo-Saxon type number 2008, I was, yes. What did that mean? And what did that lead you to? Well, central casting. It led, as a matter of fact, to a part as a Mexican, was the first one I got. In a western with a big mustache and a hat and a blanket. I was never allowed to-- I did 27 westerns. But with this voice, you can imagine, I was never allowed to speak. Round up the cattle, he said, oh, get him out, get over. And it was, wow, gosh, the first part I was ever taken to a producer for by Bill Hawkes. In a million years, you'll never guess, the producer was Pop Sherman, and it was Hopalong Cassidy. And I went in there, and he said, hey, you look great. And I was 22 or something, a thin fellow. He said, where are you from? I said, London, England. He said, get out. And he went berserk. He became like a great frog. But with Hollywood turning out several westerns a week, the very English David Niven had little option but to persevere. And I was broke, and I was an extra in a western. And I had to give a quarter of my salary to the assistant director to make sure I was called back the next day. And in those days, we were called to start work at the studio at 5 o'clock in the morning. This is Hollywood, of course, 5 o'clock in the morning. And then we were lined up, and we were sprayed various colors. So if you were playing an Indian, you were sprayed red. And a Mexican, a sort of brownish color, which I was sprayed. If you were a Negro, then you were absolutely black. And Chinese, a sort of yellow color, yellow ochre. And then you were taken and put in a bus and taken on the location. And if by any awful chance it rained, or the star was drunk and couldn't show up or something, then they canceled the whole day's work, and you were not paid anything. And you were taken back yellow or brown or green or whatever it was, and sent home. In 1935, Niven was starting to get noticed in Hollywood as much for his performances off the screen as on. He uncorked a lively friendship with Errol Flynn, also at the outset of his career. The house they shared with wall-to-wall bourbon was where up-and-coming young Hollywood went to find the action. Well, Errol and I shared a house together for 18 months. Oh, my god. It was known as Cirrhosis by the Sea, for obvious reasons. But Errol was very strange. He was a very rough bird, this fellow. And he fought, I think I'm right, in the Golden Gloves or something. He was a very good boxer. And Errol made his first picture, which was a great success, was Captain Blood. And then the second one he made was The Charge of the Light Brigade, which I was in. And I was one of the officers or something. And Errol was the commander, you know. For some extraordinary reason, typical Hollywood, it was set in India. For some crimea, it was moved to India because they only had an Indian location. I don't know. Anyway. 60 miles to Batu. We hand the herd over to the captain of the transport fleet there, and then back to India. There's nothing to be so cheerful about. You're doomed to be married soon, you know. No more pleasant doom I ever faced than one of the Queen's friends. Ah, just thick sentiment. You ought to be drummed out of the service for that, Tremug. And Flynn, they didn't like him much, the 600 men who were going to charge with the Valley of Death. It very disliked him intensely, 'cause he'd got a swollen head at that point. And they were all the roughest of the cowboys, they're all dressed up as the 27th Lancers or something. And I knew a lot of them from my days in the Westerns, and they were sort of all right to me, but Flynn, they didn't like him. And he was terribly swollen headed. Troop, wheel march! Go! One day we're sitting on our horses, 600 behind us, and Flynn and I in front. And we had, the lances for the charge were made of rubber for obvious reasons, 'cause they were so dangerous. And Flynn let the reins of his horse go, and was sitting up on the horse, giving it the full powder puff bit, you know, and getting all set up for the charge or whatever it was. So one of these immense extras, great, you know, stuntmen, with his rubber tip lent forward, right up the horse's bum, you know. So the horse, over. Flynn deposited on the ground. Now if it had been me, I'd have said, "No, please." But not Flynn, he said, "Which of you sons of bitches did that?" And he's great, a rang a tang, got up, obviously said, "I did, you wanna make something of it?" And Flynn, and he pulled him off his horse, and the fight went on for 20 minutes or something. Bring on the empty horses, comes a Hungarian director called Mike Curtiz, who had a very sketchy idea of English, and joined the charge of the Light Brigade, which we were talking about just now. He was on a rostrum, about 30 feet in the air, and Errol Flynn and I was standing below. And the time had come, he judged, to bring on the riderless charges, where the people had been knocked off during the charge. So he had this megaphone, he said, "Bring on the empty horses." So of course, Flynn and I fell on the ground. And he turned on us, through the megaphone, and said, "You bums, you lousy, you lousy limies, "you and your stinking language, "you think I know bleep nothing, and I know bleep all." We got it, didn't we? - Niven's extrovert lifestyle in Hollywood brought him to the notice of the most powerful and influential showman of them all, Samuel Goldwyn of MGM. He liked the look of the debonair Englishman, and put him under contract. - In fact, Goldwyn, his real name was Goldfish, Samuel Goldfish, and he formed up a company with a man called Archie Selwyn. And the first name of their company was Selfish. And of course, that didn't work, so they changed it to Goldwyn. And then he changed his own name to Goldwyn. And Goldwyn, for instance, he made these huge pictures, and he never went to the bank. He only put his own money into his pictures. - Well, what was your first speaking part? - First speaking part was with Elissa Landy. Don't, it was a long time ago. Divine, beautiful lady. And I was her brother, and I had to say goodbye, my dear, at a railway station. And I was such a smash doing that, that I was hired to say hello, my dear, to Ruth Chatterton in another picture. Those were my first two parts. Third part, Barbary Coast. And I was a Cockney sailor. In a whorehouse in San Francisco, I was thrown out of the window, and Miriam Hopkins and Joel McRae and Walter Brennan and several donkeys went over the top of me. And my only line was, "All right, I'll go." And I was thrown out. And I had a small part of the poet, Leo. I mean, disaster, anyway. And the sort of awful part, even now I would sweat at the thought of it, that everybody's saying, "Wait till Leo comes." You know, in the middle of some party. He'll cheer everything up. Leo, you know. - Leo, I was sure you wouldn't come. - And I had to be in a white tie and tails, and I hadn't got a white tie and tails, and I borrowed Herbert Marshall's white tie and tails. And Herbert Marshall lost a leg in the first war. - A.K. Wright, B. Producer. - And so for some reason, his fly buttons did up the opposite way, like a woman's coat. And I was so frightened, I couldn't get my fly buttons done up in the morning. So they sent a woman down from the wardrobe department to do my flies up with a button hook, was the first thing. So I had my flies done up. And I'm waiting outside on this queue light. And when they want you in, that red light goes on, and then you go in. And I could hear this party, 150 people, and they're all would-be stars in there. And I have to come on. And the gay poet and all this thing. - Hello, Lady Entwistle. Everything under control? Winterbottom. Thank you. Mr. Anders. - Yes? - I thought we might have a glass together. I brought one over for you. - Thank you. - To your lovely daughter. By the way, Mr. Anders, would you have any objections to her becoming my wife? - So I'm out, so I'm terrified. And the button's done up and the whole thing, and the red light goes on. I came on, and it was a long, what we call a tracking shot, you know, when the camera moves on the railway. I fell over the track, and I tripped up, and I hit somebody and knocked a cup into somebody. It was a disaster. And I kept on talking and somehow got the scene done. Two thunderous applause. Everybody clapped. I thought, well, you know, God, it's easy, the whole thing's very easy. He said, "David, that was great." "Just do it like that. "Don't trip over the track "and try not to knock that cup out of the person." You know, "Just do it like that." "We got that, it's in the can, wonderful." "Just do one for safety, fine." I thought, ah, I went outside, couldn't wait for the light, you know. I came on, did it, came on. This man had no film in the camera for the first one, and he addressed the whole group. He got them there early, everybody, and he said, "This is this boy's first scene in the picture. "It doesn't matter how bad the first take is, "everybody's to applaud." - Niven was soon promoted to a role which suited him, the stiff, upper-lipped army officer, a character he was to play in one uniform or another on and off for the rest of his life. In "The Prisoner of Zender" as Captain Fritz Von Tahlenheim, he had a name rather more impressive than his part, which makes it in the credits just above the cook. But it was his first big chance. It earned him a good review and the gratitude of the first few refugees from central casting. - I lost my head a bit in "Prisoner of Zender" because I suddenly realized, and it may ruin films for you forever, that extras, particularly Hollywood extras, are always in complete agreement with each other. They're always arm in arm and always going, you never see them go. So this particular film, they're all dressed as Dukes and duchesses, and they were circulating around this bowl of punch, and they were all supposed to go like this, 'cause if they spoke, instead of, "Hello," they got $25 instead of two, so they were all like this. And so I couldn't bear the sight of this mass, sort of, I don't know what it was. So I put 11 bottles of Raymond Massey's gin into the punch bowl during the luncheon interval and stirred it round with my sword and went off, came back, and after lunch, they all started in again. So by three o'clock, they were all gassed. "Ah, the son of a bitch, I'll have another." And David Selznick came on the set, and people were lying about, and it was frightful. And he said, "Who did this?" He sniffed it, once he caught on, "Who did this?" And I lost my head. It was the first big picture I'd been in, and I'd told the first, I think, only ghastly black lie of my life. I pointed to Aubrey Smith, who was 80 and deaf, and I said, "Aubrey Smith, sir, he did it." "Mr. Smith did it." "He went a little mad, sir, he did it." - Which was the first sort of starring role, then, if you like? - I think, oh gosh, it's, you know, the 84 things I gotta think through. 84 pictures. "Dawn Patrol," I think, yes. First, almost infallible part, because it was a World War I pilot who everybody loved in the mess, or whatever it was, and he was shot down, and everybody cried. And then he showed up, drunk, in pajamas with a bottle of champagne or something. You couldn't go wrong. - Scotty. - Well, where'd you get the champagne? - So suddenly, Goldwyn says, "You're going to play Edgar in Wuthering Heights." Now, Edgar is the famous worst part in the acting profession. This is the one that everybody dreads, you know. But anyway, I was in no position to argue, I was broke, and I couldn't afford the suspension. I didn't want to work with Wyler, and I didn't want to play Edgar. I mean, among other things, you stand there, and the girl says, "Take your soft, white hands off me." Look, branches the bananas I have here. So anyway, I said, "I won't do it." And Goldwyn said, "All right, you go on suspension." And Willy Wyler came to my dressing room, this miserable little beginner, and said, "Please, David, you're the only man in the world "who can really give this." Within three minutes, I was begging for the chance to play the, oh, fell for it. - Starring alongside Laurence Olivier and Merle Oberon, this would be Niven's most important chance, if he could only find a way of getting on with William Wyler, the film's temperamental director. - And the moment came. Merle's in the coach, had to drive this thing with two horses round through some Heather, and then up, stop. And I remember so well, she had to say, "Come here, go and have some tea." I had to say, "As soon as I put the horses away." So we drove up, come and have some tea, I said, "As soon as I put the horses away, cut!" And Willy Wyler's up on some rostrum up there, and I said, he said, "It's not a comedy, David, just, "round, come and have some tea." I said, "As soon as I put the horses away." - If you do come in and have a cup of tea, won't you? - Oh, thank you. As soon as the horses have been seen to. - Cut! He said, "Nothing funny about this, don't, just, "round again." 59 times, 59 times. So I said, "William, you said you weren't going "to be a son of a bitch, remember?" He said, "I do, and I'm going to be one for 15 weeks." And he was, too. Anyway, it was all right. It turned out fine. Then came the moment when I picked up the script, which is a terrible mistake, and I saw Edgar breaks down at foot of bed and sobs. Now the Merle is now dead. And I said, "Willy, I can't sob." He said, "Speak up." I said, "I can't sob, Willy, I don't know how to." He said, "Louder." I said, "I can't sob." He said, "More." "I can't sob!" He said, "All right, now you've all heard it, "ladies and gentlemen. "Here's an actor who says he can't act." "You sob." I said, "I couldn't, I couldn't." And I made a, he said, "Can you make a crying face?" I said, "Mm," I suppose, and everybody's laughing. Olivier's dead, but I go, "Mm." And he said, "All right, give him the blow." I get up. Men fall in the eye. I said, "Now squeeze." I went like this. Crying face, "Mm," and a terrible thing happened. Instead of tears coming out of my eyes, green slime. - Miss Cally. Oh, my wild heart. Miss Cally. She's gone. - You've done your last black deed here, Cliff. Leave this house. - She's at peace now, in heaven and beyond us. - What do they know of heaven or hell, Cathy? Who know nothing of life? Oh, they're praying for you, Cathy. I'll pray one prayer with them. I repeat till my tongue stiffens. Catherine Earnshaw, may you not rest so long as I live on. - Suddenly, Niven was offered the part he'd always wanted, the gentleman Crook Raffles. He was one of Hollywood's top names with a lot to look forward to when, in 1939, he surprised everyone, including Sam Goldwyn, by being the first British actor to volunteer to come home and fight in the war. Although Goldwyn was annoyed, he characteristically told Niven as they parted, "David, I've asked Hitler to shoot around you." Back in England and with an army commission, he prepared to go to France and help in the evacuation from Dunkirk, but events moved too fast for him. That same year, he abandoned his bachelor life and married a cipher clerk, Primi Rollo. Still in uniform, Niven found that he'd been put on special duty to star with Leslie Howard in an RAF propaganda film about the invention of the Spitfire, a morale booster called "The First of the Few." - Chris, a moment. - Hi, good work. - Well, there's the job, sir. I hope you're satisfied. - Satisfied? Well, as a representative of the Air Ministry, I can't commit myself. It's an old pilot. I think that was one of the best shows I've ever seen. - Oh, Mitchell would have liked to hear you say that, sir. - Yes, I'm sorry he isn't here. - Perhaps you'd like to say it to his wife? - Why, she'd love to. - She's just behind. - Oh, I see. - Air Marshal Bradford. Congratulations, Mrs. Mitchell. Will you thank your husband and tell him that he's given England something that she badly needs? - We did "The Way Ahead," which was an Army film. And it was really my fault because I wrote a thing to my colonel, really. This is during the war, obviously. Saying, isn't it time somebody did a film about the Army? 'Cause there'd been this great film about the Navy in which we served. And Muntzker, nobody, you know, never got a time of day if anybody. Muntzker, the colonel, said, "You have to go and see the Adjutant General." This is a man called Sir Ronald Adam, who was a very superior type of man. So I'm a major by this time. So I go up to London and great cries of, "Major Nevin, Major Nevin!" All this, everything going on. I'm wheeled in and here's this Adjutant General sitting there and he said, "Oh, come in, Newman." "Sit down." Newman. So I sat down and he said, "This fellow Noel Cubbard has done a good film "about the Navy in which we sailed." A good thing. "Let's have a film made about the Army." "So fall out and get it started." "Fall out and get it started." He said, "How long did it take?" I said, "Well, a month." "Give you two weeks," he said. So this terrible haggling set in and I stuck out for a month and he hung on for a fortnight and we settled for three weeks. And so then I got Carol Reed out of anti-aircraft battery or something and Eric Ambler to write the script and Peter Ustinov, who's a private in the Royal Norfolk Regiment. And they wrote madly. We took a flat at the top of Park Lane Hotel somewhere. They wrote and I just drank. So I knew that in three weeks I had to go back with the results. - Since Waterloo, there had been no provision in the statutes of the British Army for a private soldier to spend any more time with a colonel than was strictly necessary for the cleaning of a belt. And for that reason, because we had to write a script for Niven, I was made his Batman for a while. And we were stationed in the Ritz Hotel in order to write this film, which was the way ahead. And Eric Ambler was all right 'cause he was a captain at the time. He then became a colonel himself, but I never moved from my... I was really the rarest of them all because I had no pips or anything. But I sat there with Niven doing my homework when he would say, suddenly, KV, a general, is approaching and I'd drop my pen and pick up the belt and start scrubbing it. And the general would look around the corner and say, "Everything all right?" And Niven would say, "Yes, sir." And he wouldn't even look at me. I would still be polishing. And as soon as he'd gone, I'd drop all that and take up the pen again and rewrite a scene. - Eric, that's your area over there. My response is capping. Right, sir, you come with me. - Yes. - Beck! Anyway, our order is to stay here and here we stay. - Very good, sir. - He says he's not very fond of noise, sir, or of troops. Repeats that he's a pacifist and invites us to go. He says he invites-- Yes, I got it. All right, Sergeant Thatcher, we'll move in. - Very good, sir. - By 1945, David Niven had been away from Hollywood for six years, away from an industry which could change its mind 10 times in as many minutes. Understandably, but unwisely, he went back to Los Angeles expecting to pick up where he'd left off. But if his expectations hadn't changed, Hollywood certainly had. More importantly, the long interruption had come just when he might have been offered his best parts. - But I behaved like an ass, yes, because I came back and I'd been away for all those years and Goldwyn welcomed me and the whole place did, and I happened to be the first Hollywood actor to join up, you see. And so, Hollywood being his own dear self, I'd won the war single-handed, you know what they're like. So I went back, I had parties and the whole business, and I began to believe my own publicity. I cannot think why I was so stupid. I quite forgot I'd been away for six years. Nobody gave a damn if they ever saw me again, you know. And also, I was six years older. I overlooked the fact that I'd go into a restaurant, women would go... That was all rather embarrassing. But anyway, got through that. But I went to go on Monday and I said, "Look, you put me into Bonnie Prince Charlie, "which is a disaster," and you put me into something else which is worse, "and I hated it, and it's all your fault, "and you're a swine and a cad, "and I've overhead very peculiarly." And he said, "You mean you want to be free?" "You've got five years left on your contract." I said, "Certainly." He said, "All right." So I was delighted, and I thought, "This is marvelous, everybody wants me." "I'm the best, biggest boy in the school." "I'm the headmaster." Went out, and nothing much happened. And Thursday came around, and I thought, "This is a funny day." "I should be doing something." It's the day I get the check. Suddenly, for the first time, no money. And it was very unattractive for a long time. - Good scripts didn't come his way. And worried about his future, Niven was forced to accept too many similar and sometimes undemanding parts. Over the years, he became typecast as the quintessential English gentleman, or the unflappable army officer. - Do we walk? - Yes, very slowly. - The only trick to movie acting is it's all typecasting anyway. - Really? - I mean, obviously, they're not going to ask me to play a Chinese laundromat. - Request your position. Come in Lancaster. - You seem like a nice girl. I can't give you my position. Instrument's gone, crew gone too, all except Bob here, my sparks. He's dead. The rest all bailed out on my orders. Time 0335, you get that? - Oh, Jim, got your gun? - Why? - You'd be a pretty foolish-looking escort if I decided to run for it. - Come on, copper, we can't keep him waiting. - I don't know why not. One thing certainly can't start without me. I've had a minimal idea of how big my talent is anyway. I think it's quite tiny, but what I've used it for is to stay always within the frame, as I call it, and never attempted to do things that I didn't truly think I could do. And I never would try to play anything for which I'm too old now, for instance. It'd be a disaster. - Go! - Thank you, Sergeant. Everything all right, Max? - Everything's all right, sir. - Get me some more ammunition. Go on. - They crossed here, sir. That's Toto Port over there. That's a likely spot for herders to make camp, sir. - Maybe, but we'll call the cows. Who can do that? - Uh, Sykes, sir. - Can you moo like a cow, Sykes? - I'm bad at the practice, sir. - Do your best. - Moo. - The frame was probably larger than Niven or most of his directors realized. Meanwhile, any hint of frustration was swallowed in Hollywood socializing with friends like Robert Newton. - Then we did "Soldiers Three" together at MGM. And Bobby always used to say to me at the end of the day, "Niven, Niven, we're going to have a little stoop of mead or a posse of burnt sack," and all this nonsense. So I always put it off. And then the end of the picture came, last day. And he said, "Now, Niven, Niven, last day, we go to my little bistro." I said, "Bobby, look, first of all, we've got makeup on. We have, I've got to go home." "Oh, dear fellow, we go." "And also, I've got no money." "Loaded I am, dear fellow, don't worry, loaded I am." So then he had this terrible Rolls Royce. He had bought a 1912 Rolls from some used car lot. And he hired a drunken actor from Central Casting. And he dressed him up as a Rolls Royce driver with a full cockade and everything. And here's this idiot sitting in the car. And we drive to Bobby's little bistro, which was a tuna fisherman's bar in Long Beach, 35 miles away. We drive down there. It's this terrible Rolls. And there, the tuna fishermen in California, they're Japanese, Russian, or Yugoslav, all of them. And the barman was a man who made Sonny Liston look like a choir boy, this old Jack Johnson fellow. So we go in, and Bobby started hoovering down these great mahogany-colored beakers. And pretty soon, he's giving Chaucer to the Yugoslavs and Dylan Thomas to the Japanese. And it was awful. And after about an hour, I said, "Bobby, I'm leaving. I can't take this anymore." "We're off, dear fellow. Don't worry." And I said, "Well, come on, let's go." And he said, "Have any money, dear boy?" I said, "Well, I told you I haven't got a cent. Now, come on." "Problem?" He said, "Ooh." I said, "Well, your problem, chum. I'm on my way." And he said, "Nibby, get the getaway car ready. Get the getaway car." The 1912 Rolls, and I go out there with this drunken actor sitting there dressed as a chauffeur. And I said, "Open the bloody doors. Come on, get ready." Like open the doors. And Bobby's backing away, and this terrible barman's coming towards him. I heard Bobby saying, "Barman, dear, put it on my mother's account at Harrods." Well, a divine man. I wish he was here. Two years after the tragic accidental death of his first wife, Niven married a Swedish fashion model, Hjordis. "I had difficulty swallowing," he later wrote about their meeting, "and I had champagne in my knees." Hjordis's limited English saw her through the marriage ceremony at Chelsea Register Office, but Niven recalled that honeymoon conversation was a trifle one-sided. Meanwhile, his film career had stalled. His new wife and friends in London, Laurence Olivier and Rex Harrison, suggested he try the theater. So he opened on Broadway in a play with Gloria Swanson. Miss Gloria Swanson I worked with in that play, called Nina, and there were three of us in the play. And she has a clothing company on the side called the Pilgrim Corset Corporation. And she says it's good for actors to have something. She's quite right, bicycle shop or something. So anyway, she designed her own clothes. She had a contract. She was allowed to design and wear her own clothes in this piece. And they are very peculiar garments indeed. Anyway, we started off and it was a pretty bad play, but opened on Broadway with an immense advance booking. I'd never been in the theater in my life before. I didn't know what I was doing. And Swanson came on in one of these homemade garments that looked like a black taffeta tent. She came prancing on and she's very short, you know, and she flung herself into my arms. And I was so nervous, I made an element mistake and I tried to smile. And I was so frightened that my lip got stuck like this. I couldn't, I could not get it down. And I, and I, and I, both arms were engaged around this lady. And she's down here in this black tent. And my lips are, I look like a mad gopher, you know, rabbit. And I, in the initial fright and panic, I squeezed too hard in this embrace. And there was suddenly a loud report and a sort of twanging noise. And four and a half inches of white whalebone came out of her chest and right up my nose. And I, I impaled on the end of this thing. And, and finally it hurt like hell. And I thought, you know, sinus and blunt. And I thought, well, in my innocence about the theater, I thought maybe it doesn't show. And I, so I, I sort of disengaged from it. They were roaring, people were roaring. And she didn't know what was happening. She's down here, and I finally got away from the thing and tried to push it down. It came up again and they fell down. So anyway, at the end of it was, I thought if I pull it out, you know, the dress is gonna disappear. In the morning, Walter Coe, the hottest critic, you know, the New York Herald Tribune, said, I've got the clipping today hanging in my lab, but it said, "We understood from the program" "that Miss Swanson designed her own clothes, like the play." "They fell apart in the first act." - In 1956, Niven's bad luck changed dramatically when he landed the wonderful part of "Fullius Fog," the adventurer in Mike Todd's Oscar-winning film, "Around the World in 80 Days." - Now it's really very simple. We empty out some sand, and we go up. Then we pull this, and with any luck, we come down. I imagine we release some gas in the top of the balloon. - Gas? Mr. Fogg, I forgot to turn off the gas in my room. - No matter, but continue to burn, at your expense. - I was with Bogart sitting around his swimming pool, and Todd called up and got me on the telephone. He said, "Come on down to Joe's Kings House right away." "I want to see you." It was Sunday afternoon, so I went down, got my little agent to go with me, in case of anything, you know, you never know. And, uhm, so we got up, and Todd met us at the door, white bikini, white 10-gallon hat, enormous cigar. And he looked at poor little Phil Gerstie. He said, "Who's this son of a bitch?" I said, "It's my agent." He said, "Screw him, get him out of here, go on." Poor Phil had to sit in his car and wait. So I went in, and Todd said, "Ever heard of Jules Verne?" And I said, "Yes." "Ever read Around the World in 80 Days?" I said, "I weaned on it." He said, "Want to play Pilleus Fogg?" And I said, "God, I'd do it for nothing." He said, "You got a deal, boom," and dived in the pool, you know. So I'm rushing out, "Phil, come!" Get the poor little agent in. But it was absolutely wild, because he really didn't have the money. And we started in Spain, and somehow he conned, he really did, he was the con man of all time. And the first person he conned was Noel Coward. And he ran for Noel some, Todd Ayo was his great, you know, that marvelous method with that round, strange lens and everything. He ran some stuff from Oklahoma, I think it was done in Todd Ayo. And Noel thought it was marvelous. So then he conned Noel into playing a small part for fun in this picture. The next thing he conned Noel in was to writing the part, you know. Then he conned him into writing the whole scene. Then he conned him into getting a few friends to play the scene with him. So we came up with Gilgood, Johnny Mills, Trevor Howard, Robert Morley, all sorts of people played this opening scene. - 50 pounds he doesn't. - What was that, Mr. Berillia? - I said 50 pounds he doesn't. - And 150 he does. - Why did you do that, sir? Even if the odds do go down, we know that Fogg got from Marseilles to Bendizzi in time to catch the Mongolians. - Ah, but suppose he doesn't get to Suez in time. His whole itinerary is thrown out of schedule. - He can't possibly get from Bombay to Calcutta in time for his connection. Our money's a safe gentleman as everywhere in the Bank of England. And then, having got the English group in, he conned the French, and he got Fernandel and Martin Carroll and a few people like that to play with him. Then in Spain, he got Dominguin to do a bullfight for nothing, just to have some fun. And once we get back to California, he said, "Look at all these wonderful European actors." "You can't be out of this." So they all came in, Dietrich and Sinatra and Boyer and the whole lot, and he conned them all. And I don't know what he paid anybody. I think he paid them what they asked, really, because people were seen bustling away with small pictures or somebody else with a hotel bill that had been paid. You know, it was marvellous. And Sinatra's deal, I do know, was that he would work for five minutes for nothing, but five minutes only. After that, it was $5,000 a second overtime. So Sinatra was dressed up as a piano player outside the studio, wheeled in, put by the piano, did this, boom, out. - During this time, Niven regularly co-starred with Deborah Carr, who was to become his favourite actress and a close friend. - I've made, well, eight pictures with her, I think. And she's an actor's dream to work with. She makes you much better than you are. She's the most generous creature and funny. Sorry about this. And she, wicked, wicked wit, too. - I don't think I've ever had so much fun in my life as I've had in the movies I've made with David. I mean, it's just fun from morning till night. I mean, he and I finally got to the point after "Casino Royale" when we simply, we said, "I think we'd better stop working with each other "'cause we cannot do anything without bursting "into gales of hysterical sort of schoolboy "and schoolgirl humour." And I would find myself, you know, with tears running down my face and the director getting stroppy and makeup man having a fit, mascara all over my face. He is, because he's such a funny man. - We did "Bonjour Tristesse" in France and Otto Preminger was directing it and he's very ferocious, you know. And I love him, but Otto attacked me the first day. He said, "But you're supposed to be French." "You don't look French." I said, "Well, I'm sorry, I am half French." My mother was French. "But don't look French." I said, "I'm sorry, what's the matter with me?" He said, "Well, your clothes." I said, "I bought the bloody clothes, Otto, "today in Saint-Tropez where we are "and they're French clothes." "Your shoes don't look..." I said, "All right, Otto, my shoes." "I bought the bloody things down the road." "Where are mine?" he said. "Now, I have a thing about wearing other people's clothes." "I don't like to, I don't fancy it at all." And it was August in the South of France and Otto had these thick rubber sort of sandals, you know. And he took them off from his bare feet and I had to put them on for three months, my bare feet. And before every take, the most important scene, Deborah would say, "Think of those white, moist feet." You see, you make everybody happy. Doesn't she, Cécile? Yes. I do remember at the beginning of "Bonjour", "Tristesse," David, I wasn't in the scene. It was shot in Paris and it was a street scene and David was getting into the car or out of the car or something or other. And Otto was yelling and screaming at him, "Do this, do that, do the, da." And David just sat there and said, "Otto, don't shout." "Otto, don't shout." On to 1958 and "Separate Tables." This was a happy change for you, wasn't it? The bogus major with "The Guilty Secrets." Yes. Did you enjoy making that? Or was it something-- Oh, I loved it because, I mean, Terry Rattigan is such a fantastically good writer that really all you have to do if you're doing a Rattigan play or movie, all you have to do is avoid the furniture and get the lines off in your home. And he's great. If you wish to stay, you're at perfect Liberty to do so. Well, that's very good of you, but of course I have to go. Very well. I'll send you a forwarding address when I get something fixed. I hate to bring this up, but would you mind very much if I hid here in your office when I bring my bags down? I don't often want-- Of course. Miss Cooper, the plain fact is that I'm far too much of a coward to stay on here now. At least you wouldn't be forced into any more of that major stuff, would you? Well, I might be forced into something a good deal more conclusive. Cleaning the old service revolver, perhaps. Make a nasty mess on one of your carpets and bring an ugly scandal to your hotel. I'd take the risk if you would. Well, mustn't miss the old train, what, what? I must, I must stop saying what. Cherry by. Better stop doing that to us, but. I mean, it was a seedy, ghastly old phony, the man I played, and it was, it's so lovely if you're usually playing comedies and things to have a chance, you know, to do it properly. I think his most memorable performance was in a sort of semi-straight part, and that was separate tables, for which he won the Academy Award, and rightly so. And he really played that part so beautifully, but he was tremendously nervous during it, I remember very well. What was going on between takes? Well, far less jokes, because he was nervous. But anyway, I adored the play, and it was a lovely break. The only trouble was, actually picking up the Oscar was jumpy, because it's very nervous, you know, I mean, the whole-- You really don't know who-- Oh, you've no idea, and the tension is fierce, because there's 10 weeks between the nominations of five people, and the actual voting. And the night before, when all the votes were in, I went to some party, it was given for Ingrid Bergman, and everybody I saw went, "I voted for you." So I thought, well, if even a third of these people have done it, I'm home, you know. I suddenly came face-to-face with Shirley MacLaine, who's a great friend of mine, who was nominated for the Girls Award, for whom I had not voted, and I heard myself saying-- This is the awful thing. I got there, and then, finally, they did read out my name, thank God, and I was, anyway, at this point, I was in such a state of shock, that if they hadn't, I'd have gone up anyway. I'd have gone up, taken the thing, and fought. I mean, I'd have gone up anyway. So they did read it out, and I rushed, and I tripped, fell up the steps, fell headlong, and I thought I'd better explain this extraordinary entrance to the whole of America looking on television. So I said, the reason I just fell down was, what I meant to say was that I was so loaded with good luck charms that I overbalanced. I made an idiot pause after the word loaded. And I became the first self-confessed drunk to win the damn thing. - On the stage were John Wayne and Irene Dunne, who named David Nevum Best Actor of the Year. It was the first time the debonair Briton, favored on both sides of the Atlantic, had won the top award, though he starred for 20 years. I think the abiding memory, so far perhaps, certainly for boys of view in the cinema, is probably the Guns of Navarone. Was that physically hard work? - Oh, that was a really tough one. We all got knocked around in that one, because we were on it about nine months, and we shot it all, most of it in the Greek islands. And when you have big storms at sea to photograph, you know, obviously you can't photograph them at sea. Those terrifying scenes in the boat were done in a big sound stage at Shepperton. And they had 30 tons of water in these big tip tanks to make the waves, stimulate the waves, so they'd tip these huge tanks up in a row. And then 30 tons of water would come down a sluice, you see, and then we'd get it. And we all got knocked around, we were all being bandaged up in a peck, had 14 stitches up here, and I had the back put out a joint, and everybody got hurt. And frightfully cold, in an awful tank. We were in it for about six weeks on end. Incidentally, rum does no good, I tried that. - I remember that. - Does no good at all. I used to drink it all the time, it only does is open your pores and you get double pneumonia. - David is a workaholic, if that's the right phrase. I've known on every movie we've made together, as it comes towards the end, he starts getting very nervous and very, very upset because when, "I'll be out of work, I'll be out of work." He had to know what he was going to do next. He would go from one to the other, one to the other, one to the other. And I think because of that kind of horror he had of not working, he accepted parts and accepted movies that really weren't worthy of him. - If sometimes films simply traded on the niven name, neglecting his real strengths as an actor, he could still turn in pleasing performances. - Oh, I'm enchanted to see you, my old friend. How capital, how capital. Oh, I haven't clapped eyes on you since, oh, that strange affair of the decapitated clergyman. - Yes, yes. - You mean that I have been bombed, bullied, and baited out of retirement to deal with you? - Do you suppose he's a junkie? - Seems to be. Now, Jimmy, as your uncle, I really must insist. - What is it? - He put a sheet of invisible glass between us. God knows, I know how you feel, but you must realize-- - I don't think you do at all. - But you don't understand the operation. I don't know how to say this to you, but we just can't risk your old ticker. - There's nothing wrong with it, Bill. I have my pills, I'll take 'em. - "Paper Tiger," made in 1975, gave Niven his last chance to tackle a meaty part. As in "Separate Tables," he plays a phony major. This time, his bluff is called by a small boy. - What on earth are you doing? - My father said I should always be able to look at myself in the mirror and not feel ashamed. I cannot look at myself, Mr. Bradbury, because I've been dishonest and because I'm frightened. - What have you done that was dishonest, Khaichi? - I have not been trusting you, Mr. Bradbury. After all the many brave things you have done. Please forgive me, sir. I promise in future to be patient and do only what you want me to do. - Oh, thank you, Khaichi. Naturally, I accept your apology. You go to bed now. - My Lord, it was hot, we did it in Malaysia. And we were working in a tin mine a lot of the time, and it was 137 degrees in front of the camera and 92% humidity, it was just appalling. And so we were sweating like pigs all the time, and we had to take salt pills to keep the water in us. And some people can't take the salt, I couldn't. I threw up in the lift in the Kuala Lumpur Hilton all over some Australians who just got off a plane. - Does he think of himself as a great actor? - I think he knows that he's about the best as a comedian that there is, nor has been, in the business. I think if you were to say to him straight, "Do you think you're the greatest actor in the world?" He'd scream with laughter and make a joke out of it. - I never watched them. - Did you ever watch your pictures? - Well, I really hated them. This is not an act, I really hated it, it embarrassed me. Because first of all, I think if you're a movie actor, the less you know about what you do, the more chance you have of remaining natural. And for instance, if you see yourself on the screen, if you go and look at yourself, you only look at yourself, you don't look at the scene. You watch yourself like a dog watching a snake. And you see yourself go like this, you think, "It's pretty good, that, keep that." Or you think, "Oh, that's terrible." So you don't move that again, and then pretty soon you're like Clive Brook, you don't move at all, you know? So I never go, and I've made 84 pictures, and I think I've seen 11 of them. - Some stars adopt modesty late in life. When you're big, it's easier. But with David Niven, it wasn't like that. He was genuinely unassuming. So much so that he'd never believed his death leaves a well-tailored gap no living actor can quite fill. I met him a number of times, both privately and professionally. It was something I look forward to. Always he was courteous, warm, and funny. And in a business not noted for its charitable judgments, I heard the same from everybody. But for all that, you never felt you really knew the man, or at least no more than he wanted you to know. Early in his career, he'd obviously decided to keep his personal life to himself and to make the public event a celebration. And the party goes on in the books and films. I'll leave the last word to him. "The least you can do if people pay you a lot of money," he said, "is to be on time and know the checks." Good night. Well, this paper I find on the set. We're now making "Death on the Nile," you know, which is a 1932 dated movie. And this is a 1932 dated newspaper. This is "The Observer." And I just see right here, we're looking up travel. Wait a minute, here we are. "Christmas Cruise, Morocco, Spain, Portugal, "12 days, 12 guineas." And here's another one, which I just spotted. You can go to the West Indies for seven weeks on the Duchess of Richmond. Do you think she'd mind? I don't think she'd be terribly pleased.
