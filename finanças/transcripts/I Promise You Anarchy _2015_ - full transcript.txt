We're back to where we were A piece of meat A promise of a drunk The ripped high school sneakers TV, your first bra My first hair soap The skin going in and out Up and down Wishing and forgetting We've grown so much We ride beds We destroy sunrises And now we're just insecure With time eating our bones We are a sick generation sometimes happy sometimes with hate Sometimes looking up to the sky Waiting for lightning One God A plane full of true love Hoping someone Don't solve the century Without living in hell Cigarette in hand, we talked We cry, we kiss With the smoke of the future The liquid of the future The last breath What our parents called the future And that actually comes dressed Gifts and don't feel Not complacent the only one who dares Facing us A mirror at five in the morning Dark circles, blows Traces of old age on your face The years you smiled so much The afternoons you imagined eternal Running away, living Flying into the sun Like seagulls Breaking this system Born and devour Devour and pay Pay and kill Kill and dance, dance and fly Let's fly until our legs fall off We will reign in heaven And in the broken window Let's kiss Before the era is destroyed A building in your head A plane on my lips Fire, screams So many deaths And every Friday night We got back together To tell us living lies They ask for milk, they ask for bread They ask you to please them Until they fall asleep We are our own generation We are our own monster We are our own now And yet We're in love -Hi Brenda. -Hey. How are you? And your son? I haven't heard from him since Sunday. If you see him, say I got the money of him, of a bid we made. no? Call his cell. No way, Brenda. Never answers me. Neither to me.
