A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES [doorbell rings] Surprise. I guess I have to make the first move. You said we could have a good time. [sighs] I'm so tired. You're back. I'll let you in. - Well, aren't you going to invite me in? - Oh, yeah. Come on in. Did you have a party here? [Burcu] The girls came over for a drink. Just a drink? We need to talk. Sit down. - Will you make me some tea first? - No tea. You can make yourself some later, but we need to talk about something first. Look, let me get something out of the way. I know what you're angry about. But I swear, it's not my fault the guy turned out to be a conman. I don't... Hold on. What? I spent everything we saved for the wedding. But I'm going to find the bastard. I'll get our money back, don't worry. What are you talking about? I mean, how much did you give him? No, no, no, no. I don't want to know. [exhales heavily] I want to break up with you. Oh, come on, now. Are you serious? It's only money. Is that all you care about? What are you saying? What are you even talking about? I didn't even know about the money until you told me. I mean... this isn't working out anymore, and it's not what I want for myself. Listen, I know you're mad because I'm not taking you out for dinner. - But I'm not familiar with the area. - Are you kidding me? I don't care about that. I don't care if you take me out on the town or not. Oh, my God! Do you think my whole purpose in life is to make you happy? What could be more important than having a happy family with me? Are you aware we're getting married? Our parents are planning the wedding. They are happy about it. They want this. They're thrilled that I'm getting married and not gonna end up a spinster. And that I'm going back to Trabzon to live next door. You must be thrilled, too. You get yourself a servant to bring you your slippers every day for the rest of your life! Good for you! And all you have to do is take me out on the town. [scoffs] That's not a nice thing to say. - What's your deal? - What's my deal? Nothing, Tuncay. All right? All of you are completely right, and I'm the one who's wrong. But I don't want to get married to you anymore. I want to break up with you, Tuncay. [sighs] Burcu, you're drunk. Go to bed. I really don't like it when you get drunk like this... Tuncay, just fucking leave! - How dare you talk to me like that. - Tuncay, go, Tuncay. - Tuncay, leave! - Burcu... - Tuncay, don't! - I don't understand... I told you to get out! - Let's just take a minute. - Let go! Get out! - Get the fuck out. Get out! - Hey, what are you doing? Take these, too. Take your damn shoes. Get out! You're gonna regret this tomorrow. ["La Foule" by Edith Piaf playing] [chuckles softly] So, you tell me. - Tell you what? - What you wanna do. I'm all ears. I'm honestly not feeling great right now, so why don't we call it a night. Oh, don't be like that. Let's just have fun tonight. [doorbell rings] Oh. Who could that be? Burcu? Am I too late? Oh, it's you. It's not too late. You're just not needed. Actually, it's not what you think. I should go. Hold on. [upbeat rock music playing] Can we have three glasses? I'll have the same. Thank you. Hi, guys. Can I have an order of that, please? What? I'm actually hungry today. [giggles] Mmm. Is it good? [adult Işık] We were all so different from each other. But that was the first time we felt like a team. We never talked about it, but we were all thinking the same thing. We changed each other. This friendship was good for all of us. But, will we ever all be together again? Will I ever see any of you? [bell dings] [pan clatters] [exhales sharply] [knock at door] [knocking continues] [chatting indistinctly] - We're gonna fuck you up, man. - Here they come. Hey, there. Anything I should know about? Does that concern you? Should it? Something's going on. Huh. [water running] Kerem. [water stops] What is it? Oh. Good morning, gentlemen. What a crowd we have here. [chuckles] - Good morning, sir. - [Refik] Morning. [Refik coughing] [Refik whistling] - Have a good class today. - Thank you, son. Well, congratulations, Necdet. You've done a wonderful job. This place is going to be the pride of the school. Well, I wouldn't say that. That's too kind. Oh, sir, come on. You saw it through from the beginning. You deserve all the credit. Well, maybe you're right. Wow! Wonderful. Just wonderful. Great job, sir. Okay, we've seen it. We'll have plenty of time to admire it later. After you. LABORATORY Where's Kerem? - I don't know. - Come on. We gotta find him. Sir, you wanted me? Oh, welcome, Mr. Kerem. [shushes] What are you and your bitch of a girlfriend up to? Shut up if you want to keep your teeth. Oh, look at this tough guy. - We're gonna fuck you up, man. - What kind of man are you? I see you brought your girlfriends to help. - [chuckles] - [Kerem grunts] [grunting] You check upstairs. [man] One more time.

That's not very fair. No, I did not play with your son's feelings at any point. Uh! No, I do not think I'm too good for your son. No, no, you're going too far there. [phone ringing] Grandma, you're the only one who hasn't called. Why would you say that? I'm not trying to kill you. How can you say that, Grandma? I'm not trying to disgrace the family on purpose.

Since you've only just arrived, have you heard about the terrible attack on our school? What happened? Your delinquents, the ones you defended, ruined the new laboratory! They also assaulted some other students, one of whom was hospitalized! God, is everyone okay? But don't worry. It's all for the best. I've talked to the Director of National Education. There is no need to convince the board to reach a unanimous vote anymore. We can expel them with a simple majority now. After you. The board is waiting for you. Let's go. Are you okay? Thinking of you. It's all good. - [chuckles] - You? I'm fine. It's just a little scratch. - Let me ice it. - Mm. Come on. I'm gonna kill those assholes. It's okay. We needed our daily workout anyways. [laughs] You're crazy. Now what? Will they kick us out? Looks like it. I guess we're really screwed this time. All right. Let's think. Osman, why do you always eat hazelnuts? [siren wailing in distance] I have low blood sugar. [laughing] [Eda] Is that it? Do you think... Ms. Distas can save us one last time? You can't knock us out with one vote anymore. It's over and done. - Um, go ahead, sir. I'll be right there. - No, let's go in. - Please. I'll join you in a second. - Where are you going? - I need you to pull the fire alarm for me. - What? Don't ask. Just do it. All right... I don't think we need to discuss this. We suspend Işık, and we just expel the four of them. Let's start the vote right away. Absolutely, sir. You're right. It's long overdue anyway. [alarm blaring] - What's that? - Fire! Fire! - Fire! - Okay, calm down. Fire! I can't believe this is happening again! Easy! Calm down. Calm down. Slow down. [students shouting] [bell continues ringing] Oh, my God. The fucking school's burning. Come on. Let's get out of here. Come on. Come on! [clamoring] So why did you do it? They were beating up Kerem. We had to help him. Sinan went in to help Kerem. When I got there, they were fighting... We did what we had to do to help our friend. End of story. I see. So you did it to protect each other. I get it. But here's the problem: my one vote can't save you. If they get a majority, they will expel you. - Are you serious? - [Burcu] Yeah. So think it through. I will, too. But you should all consider talking to your parents. You think that this is the end? I don't know, Eda. I don't know. - But talk to them. - Ms. Distas. - Why did you vote for us? - I didn't. The board votes in three days. No, I mean, the first time you were one against 11. We didn't get expelled because of you. Why? Because I was afraid. I was just scared. Each time I voted no it was because I didn't have the courage to derail someone else's life. What about now? Now, I changed my mind. I've learned how brave you have to be to be different in this world. I mean, each of you is very different. And... I understand now just how hard that is. Or just... to be yourself. I understand that now. We're in deep shit. By the way, thank you. Thank you, all of you. Dummy. You'd do it for us. Osman, what should we do? It's the end of the road. Everyone should go and talk to their families. [Necdet groans] What a day. [Ayşe] Who could have set off the fire alarm? I do have my suspicions. [Refik] Probably a student playing a prank. Let's make sure it doesn't happen again. - [Ayşe] The board meeting got canceled. - [Refik] Yeah. [Ayşe] But it's okay. We'll issue an expulsion on Friday. I've talked to Mr. Necdet. Guess what? From here on out, there won't be anything in our way. [Refik] I hope not. [grunts] [Kemal] Can I? So, tell me. What happened today? Why did I have to set off the fire alarm? It wouldn't have anything to do with the vote on your expulsion, would it? Why? What do you care about us? Tell me. Ms. Distas. Your girlfriend. She doesn't want us to get expelled. She has her reasons. We're her cause. And you wanted to help her. She asked, and you did. Right? How sweet is that? Just because she asked. Without even thinking. It's sweet.

You said the board convenes in three days, right? We'll ask for a transfer in the meantime, saying we're already planning to send you abroad. So you won't be a dropout. Let's apply for the transfer right away. We'll send you to France, and you can finish your schooling there. [Kerem's father] Look at my son Kerem. Vandalizing your own school, huh? Bravo. You screwed up big-time. Good job. What do we do now? Or, what am I going to do? Isn't that right? Because you expect me to fix it. "My father will take care of everything." I'll make another donation or something. Do my best to save your ass once again. Don't know why, really. Since you're destined to be a failure. - Don't say that. - Why can't I say that? He's clearly not good for anything. Okay, fine, I'll pull some strings. - Don't. - What? Don't do anything, you hear me? Look at him. Now he's too proud for his father's help. I don't want anything from you. - I just wanted to let you know. - Did anybody ask for your opinion? Because I didn't hear it. Did anyone ask for the opinion of a high school dropout? Hm? Not me. If you interfere with this, I'll do insane things you can't even imagine. I'll humiliate you. That's what you care about. The humiliation. I'll do it. I'll go and stab someone and go to prison. I'll do it just to show you. Wanna bet? Don't do anything. Stay away from me. Mm-hmm. [Osman's father] I can't believe this. You're not the foolish kind, son. In fact, you're very smart. You're special. I don't know if I've ever told you this. I respect you more than anyone else. Since you were born, you've followed your own destiny. You're not like me or your mother. You're not someone who will get stuck in the place he was born. Or, you weren't. I would have never guessed you would have made a mistake like this. A dumb kid's mistake. Don't worry. I'm gonna fix it. How will you fix it? I'll handle it. Don't worry. I'll work something out. My God, I can't believe it. How on earth could this happen to our perfect family? Our precious daughter, the light of our lives, is literally getting suspended from school! Is that it? It's a scandal! No other way to put it. It's a scandal. But when she brought those bad kids here, I knew I could not trust them at all. And now look what they've done to my princess... Mom, it's not like that. I did what I did. Whatever I've done, I did out of my own free will. [scoffs] Listen to that. Free will? What do you mean by that? I can't believe this right now! Is this really my own daughter talking to me, or what? You know what? That's it. It's over. Over and done. From now on, you can't do anything. You won't go to school this week. Your dad will get you a doctor's note. You better sit down and think long and hard about what you did. Think about your future! Mom, no. I can't even go to school? Absolutely not. You're not doing anything. And as for your birthday... and your party... Never again! Now go to your room. Go on. Now! Go on! She's your daughter, too. Hey, Dad, can I talk to you about something for a second? [Sinan's dad over phone] Sinan, I'm busy. I'm helping the twins with their homework. Can we talk later?

You coming or not? Good morning, everyone. Today, we're starting a new subject. Listen up and pay attention: 20th-century Western literature. Now... World War I had a negative effect on both art and literature in Western society. This triggered pressure on society and caused people to think everything was hopeless and life was in vain. My life's about to be ruined, but I've never been happier, you know? Oh. Here. Wow! Gifts and all. - You're such a romantic for a tough guy. - [chuckles] Just kiss me. [Sinan coughs] [clears throat] It's really not fair to Işık. I need to tell you all something. My parents want me to transfer before the meeting. So they can... send me to a school in... in France, before the ruling hits my records. Really? I know. I know it's wrong. I mean, it's running away. I feel like I'm letting you all down. It's not the right thing to do, but... I don't know. I don't know. It's just... You getting expelled won't save our asses. Don't worry about it. [Osman] He's totally right. Just go and save yourself. Our records are worse than yours. No school would accept us. Of course. You gotta take the transfer. For sure. - You want me to go? - Save yourself. - I don't know. It just doesn't feel right. - [Sinan] Don't be an idiot. Go. ♪ We'll see what we are Where we are ♪ ♪ We can't know ♪ ♪ Right now! ♪ [laughs] Oh, you came! You deranged bitch. - Sending us letters inviting us all here. - [chuckles] [both chuckle] A chick never forgets. Well, are we gonna just stand here, or are you gonna offer me a drink? Yeah, yes. Yes, come in. [adult Eda] Wow. [phone ringing] [doorbell rings] What now? [doorbell rings continually] I rang the bell this time. Didn't just walk in. So nice of you, Tuncay. What are you doing here? I thought you must've gone back to Trabzon because everyone in the entire town got the news that we broke up. I had to telll people what happened. Let me come inside so we can talk. - No, you can't come in. I'm busy. - You're busy? - I'm busy thinking about something. - Thinking about me? About how you'll apologize? Things happen. You were drunk. It's okay. I was obviously really hurt because I've never seen that side of you. But then I realized it's probably the stress of arranging a wedding - that's making you... - Tuncay. What are you even doing at my apartment right now? We broke up. Are you even aware of that? - You weren't being serious... - Tuncay, it's over. Done. - We broke up. - Is there someone else? [sighs] That's it. - What? Who? - Everybody. Because I do whatever anyone tells me to do. They just tell me, and I do it. I'm stupid that way. Even though I told you I wanted to break up yesterday, today I might say, "Let's get back together." Is that right? Is that what you think will happen right now, Tuncay? Oh, my God! I guess this is what being a woman is like. I guess being a woman, I don't know my own mind. I need a man to come take care of me. - Are you making fun of me right now? - Yes! I have a lot of things on my mind. I don't want to be in this relationship. Go to Trabzon. Do what you want. Find a nice girl, and take her out! Just leave! [doorbell rings] [exhales heavily] What now? - Is your fiancé inside? - No, he's not. Uh, why are you here? Let's brainstorm together. Maybe we can come up with a good idea. Setting off the fire alarm is not really a permanent solution. And just so you don't get the wrong idea... - Here. - Billy doesn't brainstorm? - Are you kidding me? - So, you're not denying it? I'm not, because I don't think I owe you an explanation. Okay, fine. Come in. I don't owe you an explanation either. [inhales, exhales heavily] - I'll go see if the tea is ready. - Why don't we drink something else. - Like what? - Like alcohol. You know drinking makes you more creative. So, any ideas? Why do you want to save these kids, anyway? From what I can see, they don't want to be saved. - They have terrible records. - [sighs] Yeah, okay. I know you're right. Each one of them are just having trouble conforming to the rigidity of high school, finding their place. I don't think we should be punishing them. - Did you find anything in there? - No. I didn't find anything there. Look, maybe you shouldn't see this as a punishment. You can understand what they've done when you look at the files. But that's not who they are, Kemal. Their actions are written there. Our actions reveal who we are. Let them live their own destiny. Maybe it's better for them to live with the consequences of their actions. Maybe this fight is all for nothing. What fight? I don't think I can fight this anymore. Let me tell you something I learned recently. Acknowledging weakness can be good. If you're sure you've done all you can do, you have to accept defeat gracefully. That's part of being an adult. Maybe it might be time to give up the fight once and for all. [Işık's mother] Yes? What do you want? Isn't it enough that you ruined my daughter's life? [Sinan] You're right, ma'am. You know, Işık didn't come to school today, and we started a new subject. I just don't want her to fall behind. Hm. So, you're here to teach her the new subject? Yes, I wanted to help out, because... I don't want the situation to hurt her in the long run. I guess that's fine. Okay. Come in. - Would you like something to drink? - Chocolate milk would be good. Thank you. [Işık's mother] Come on in. This door will stay open. Just go over the lesson and that's it. Okay? Go on. ♪ Be my river, come, flow again ♪ ♪ Be a butterfly, come, fly again ♪ ♪ Be my flower, come, blossom again ♪ ♪ Be a wind ♪ ♪ Be my river, come, flow again ♪ ♪ Be a butterfly, come, fly again ♪ [Sinan] We started 20th-century Western literature today. Everyone in Europe was traumatized by the first World War, and this trauma affected both art and literature. First, they thought everything was meaningless, and this became Dadaism. "Dada" is defined as a meaningless word. So, a movement was started by people who felt that everything was meaningless and death was right around the corner. Wait a minute! So, how are you? I mean, you look beautiful. Really? Whatever that means. I always look good. Don't you know that, my love? How are you? [sighs] Empty. I mean... there's a hole in my heart. I never had a real friendship after our group. They all felt fake. Of course, after all that we'd been through... I know what you mean. I think the world seems to have a bad problem with integrity.
