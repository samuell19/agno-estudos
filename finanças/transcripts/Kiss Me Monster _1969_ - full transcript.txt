Stop! - Oh! I've got the feeling that you want to forget your friend, McClune. Where have you been? I really think the people at Interpol are going crazy, because they've given me a very peculiar case. Yes, there's some kind of madman who's developing humans out of tin cans or something like that. Have you heard anything about this? Maybe you can give me some information. That would be helpful. That case has been settled ages ago. Kiss me. Because in a half hour, we're flying back home. Fresh! One just doesn't kiss a lady in public. Okay, I just remembered I have only two tickets and I need one more. I've already told you that that plane is sold out. I really don't think you love me anymore. Humph, it's not that. I'd just have a bad conscience if I kept you from your work. Really? At this point, I don't understand anything anymore. First, you explain to me that the case has been settled a long time ago, but I should carry on with it. I have a feeling that you don't want me to fly in the same plane with you. I'll get all of my work straightened out and follow you with the next plane. Everything is getting straightened out in my brain. Whatever happens, McClune is always on the ball. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Regina, listen. What is it? We just can't leave it in the car. What? The crate, of course. Oh, for God's sake! No, no, not in back. In front. Have you got it? Yeah, yeah. That really would've been a big mistake. And how. Just look at that. What? You just can't trust the cleaning woman anymore. You're right. It hasn't been swept. Just imagine it if we would've left it in the car. That could only happened to somebody who didn't have a brain. Would you be meaning me by that? No, but I had thought of it. And you call yourself a friend. That's right. Why do I always buy shoes one size too small? It's your own fault. The water's still warm. I could really take it. Oh, boy, who are you saying that to? So could I. So there's no misunderstanding, I was talking about a bath. Don't be so touchy. We'll make ourselves a cozy and quiet evening. Do you know what I'd like to have right now? Yes, we ought to have a television set. What's that? Ah, come on in. The man comes faster than some. Here I am again. Changed as well, isn't that great for us? I've only come to ask for one thing and then I'll go again. What is it that Interpol needs? A kiss? - Thank you. - Hello there. Good evening. May I introduce to you, this is Inspector Kramer. He's a very important colleague of mine at Interpol. - Good to meet you. - Pleased to meet you. Have we committed some crime? It looks almost as if you wanted to arrest us. Yes. Perhaps. Maybe we could sit down first. Yes, come on. I think it's fabulous how quickly you did it. Yes, I'm the fastest. Are you? I think I must ask you a few things first. Quite enchanting. It's like this. Mac told me a lot about you, it's true. But he didn't tell me you were two such enchanting ladies. Yes, you should have asked me. That was a mistake. You would've heard all that from me. For instance, that we made a big tour. And with a lot of nothing on top, but we also met with a great success. What a shame I didn't see you. But as I was unable to be present, I'd like to know what other experiences you have had. Hmm? You see, we know that you have a lot of other talents. We have never experienced anything that should not have happened! Hmm. It would be better if you answered and told me everything from the beginning. Exactly as it happened. Very well. Just as you like. I don't think it would be good for us to brush up against the police, too, so I'll tell you what happened. It began on a December night, here in this house. Two forward, one back. Left, right. Where can I find Paul? Yeah. Hey, what's the matter? I just had a lovely dream. I suppose it was about Paul Newman again. Yes. I just stripped for him. What's that? Visitors for us, I guess. It's a little late, isn't it? Go on, open the door. All right. I'll cover your beautiful back for you. Good. All right, I'm coming! Just a moment, please! How impertinent! Well, you know you're not the youngest anymore. Humph! Oh. Thank God! I thought you were never going to open the door. It's very important. I'm to deliver this here. The score is for the Red Lips. She is... What's the matter with him? The black devil's under the Red Sea. Wherever we turn up, people die like flies. Give it here. There's a strange seal on it. Like a wagon wheel. "In my day, Abilene..." Look here. "Shone like a star." ♪ La la la la ♪ Tell me, what is this supposed to mean? I really thought you had more taste. We've got a dead man lying here and you're playing on the guitar. Hmm. Oh, please, forgive me. Since when did you become so sensitive? "Words whispered to the wind." All right, then, let's think about what we're going to do with him. Yeah. Near Puerto Carlos would be the best, wouldn't it? I don't care. Hey, do you think I can manage on my own? Get a hold of him with me, won't you? We can't stay here forever. How disgusting. He's a heavy one. Quite good-looking, though. I think so, too. Yes, that's the life. Some swim on the top and the others eat the fish. Nietzsche? Oh, quiet. But that was the last time. I'm telling you. I'm finished with it now. One... Two... Three! Come on, let's go. Our little chicks are on their way. Mr. Vic as! Mr. Vic as! Mr. Vic as! Yeah? Excuse me a minute! Just a minute. It's urgent. What's up? The birds are on their way. So quickly? Yeah. Make sure nobody finds out about it. So... Here you are. Sharika, what is wrong? Why are you so nervous? The girls are coming. Already? They were with the Abilenes. Aha. Hey, things are starting to move. Very good. Fabulous. Yeah. What is it? I beg your pardon, but... I said it a hundred times, I don't wanna be disturbed. The two girls are on their way. What? Already? It's nice here, isn't it? The water stinks, doesn't it? Mmm. Hello! Taxi. Good day. Very nice. You are as pretty as pictures, ladies. Please. So, you think so? Well, then, look after our luggage. Gladly. I'm not your type, I hope you realize that. I'll have to think about it. I'll help you if you like. Actresses? No, we do a number on the tight rope. Where have you got your circus? It's in the suitcase. Then let's get going. We'd like to go... To the Hotel Camacho, where else? I live there, too. Please, my lovely ladies. How much is it? A dinner with you alone. Areal and proper little playboy. From my father. Got a date already. All right, how about tomorrow? Sorry, I've got a lot to do. And you? You should oil your door. What for? I like it when it squeaks. Uh-huh. I don't know, I can't be in form. I just can't get anywhere. Why don't you try tomorrow? I'd even spend a couple of dollars. Oh! Well. Well, let's see then.

Let's go back, we're leaving. Don't make a scene. Come on. Mrs. Bertrand? You see? She's not here. I told you that right away. There's no point. We shouldn't have come here at all.

It's quite incredible what you are doing with me. I would just like to know what's going on. Oh, nothing of importance. Professor Bertrand wanted to tell me something. And suddenly he got a knife in his back, just like his wife. That was the third one. Nice people here, aren't they? You promised me we'd go on a trip around the world with a strip tease number. But at the moment, things are far too interesting for us to go away. Besides, I've got a feeling there's going to be a lot in it for us. I see. You break your word and I've got no choice but to continue to fool around looking for murderers. And I don't want to anymore. Then we'll just go on our world trip later on. After all, we can go when we like. Coats of arms, seals, rabbits' teeth. Hmm. What do rabbits' teeth look like? Well, roughly like yours, only a bit sharper. Yes, wings of the bat and the skeleton. Very imaginative, isn't it? I think it's horrible. What do you expect? It is a secret sect, and a lot of them even sacrifice naked girls. Imagine that! On cold stones, too. Yes, yes. Keep on looking. Ah, this should interest you. Oh, here it is. Abilene. "Up to the beginning of the 20th century, her main abode was in the territory of Abilene. Later forbidden because of the struggles for power and violence. The coat of arms of the Abilenes: a yellow flower and two crossed fingers over a lion's head," according to this. "The seal of the secret sect remained unknown. Only fragments were found because of a death sentence." Hmm. "It is claimed here that the sect survives to this day, and among its members are many scientists, including the famous biologist, Pinfield," and our Professor Bertrand. It remains to be seen about such famous people as Professor Bertrand. What did that guy at the bar say? That Linda's expecting us? ♪ Words whispered to remnants ♪ ♪ Abillene's a beautiful city ♪ ♪ It's written on the wind ♪ ♪ Abilene is a beautiful city ♪ Careful, we're being watched. I've got some important news for you. From whom? You'll soon know. Go a bit further. We'll soon know. Go a bit further. Why don't you read it to me? "Come immediately to the old mission that's located by St. Catherine's.” What? Undersigned X. Stay here, ladies. I'm pleased to see you. Please, come in. You have nothing to be afraid of here. We've been waiting for you. Hello. Hello. Hello. This church is the meeting place of our secret society. We haven't had a meeting here for many years. Well, now I've called this assembly together. This is very dangerous for us. Luckily, we still have good connections, even with the police. Our society will go on forever. To come to the point, we have a task for you. Professor Bertrand was a great man. He wanted to improve the world. He's no longer alive, but the results of his scientific works still exist. And that's what our society is interested in. All we know is that the professor stayed for a long time in Lopogan. Lopogan is one of the neighboring islands not far from here. There, he lived and worked. In our opinion, that's where you'll find what we're looking for. Will you accept the mission? Yes, but we don't work for nothing. Yes, I know. That's the reason why we've arranged this meeting. We offer you... $80,000. In Lopogan, you'll meet our contact man. The password is Papi Rosa. Papi Rosa. - Cut that out! - Cut that out! Just a minute. Papi Rosa! Papi Rosa! Hello. Papi Rosa. This evening at 8 o'clock we'll meet at the old Spanish castle. I'll be there with a bouquet of flowers. What for? So you'll be able to recognize me again. But of course, you had to ask. Okay. So come on, baby. And the next lady. Thank you. Ole! Ole! I'll take the chest, you take the belly. Makes the nicest cushion. Does my bathing cap tickle? Uh-huh. Tell me, who do you work for? Truthfully. Sometimes, when I count my earnings, I think it's the Salvation Army. Oh, yeah? Stay with me, brother. Come on, now, you're an agent for the red Chinese. That's all I need. Come on, tell your baby. No, I'm ticklish. Interpol? I've got no idea what you want, you two cats. Pay well? Depends on how you take it. The rise in the cost of living, the old age pension schemes. After all, one does have to take a picture. What time is it, actually? Must be nearly 8-00. - What? - What? Why? Are you in a hurry? These women. Hello. Do you see this flower here? Yes. Well, I'm the Abilenes' contact man on this island. Do you understand? Yes. Before you look any further, I found out something really important. Yeah? It's quite different now. I think there's something wrong with his breathing. What's the matter with him? Not a soul to be seen. Can you see anything? No. Come on, let's get away from here. I sent for you. I wanted to make your acquaintance. You're the famous twins. Quite a well known number. And who are you, if I may ask it? All right. The Scandal Mistress. It's something like an artist's name. I used to dance in a marketplace with one of those Mexican hats full of bananas. Humph! What's that got to do with scandal? I'd forgotten to put on anything. Now, how is it with you? You wanna play here? Yes. But not with tails and all that. That's old stuff. Perhaps you think so, but we got first class reviews. My audience is used to spicier things. I understand. I knew that when I was 14 years old. The old turn. But it works. Well, let's try it out. And try another musical number, too. We'll drop in sometime. I hope there aren't any dead people. I don't know why I'm supposed to put on this horrible costume. Terrible, isn't it? You can't leave it alone? I'm really curious about what she will say. I'm not. Is anyone there? May I speak to you for a moment? Please, do come in. I'd like to make a suggestion to you if you have a little time for me... No, I'm sorry, we haven't. A good friend of mine would like to make your acquaintance. What? He asks for your understanding. He's got a lot of money. For us? You know how it is. He'd like to have a little talk with you. But alone. So, it's like that. Now, what are you thinking? He's a perfect gentleman. Well, think of that. Humph! Sweetie, you must be mixing us up. Try down on the corner again, all right? You will be sorry for this! Hurry up and get out of here! Oh, no, I find it much too country-like. I really don't know what's the matter with you. Sell yourself as a girl from the country. What do you mean? I'll get changed, then I'll run my number off. ♪ In my day in Abilene ♪ ♪ Da, da-da, da-da-da ♪ I think they're coming over, but at the moment they still don't know what they should put on. All right, keep watching. And if anything happens, phone me. I must be informed about everything. Yes. You can rely on me.

Good evening. Well, what is it? Have you little time? No. I just want to talk to those two girls over there. You can do me a favor and bring them over here if you want. For you, always. Thanks, sweetie. Listen, that will be settled. Since when have you had scruples? Unfortunately, we can't consider your sensitive soul. Thank you very much for the invitation. We are just in the right mood. We could use a drink. Forgive me for just asking you to come over like this, but... It's true. My mother used to always say, don't let strangers invite you, but what the hell? Perhaps she was right, there. But please, we came of age quite a while ago. I am Diana and this is Regina. And I'm Eric Vic as. Do sit down, please. What can I get for you? A bourbon with soda. Me too, please. For me, the same as usual. You know already. Mm-hmm. Yes, my ladies, you really are much prettier than I had imagined you would be. Yes? Tell me, how did you actually know we were coming? Well, when such a pretty freight is unloaded at the port, everybody gets to know about it. You must have plenty to do if you pick up what's unloaded in the port. Yes, well, I just have an exciting job, and here the opportunity arose of combining business with pleasure. Didn't it? And what is your business? To be well informed. I think we should speak to each other frankly. That makes life easier, doesn't it? I've got no objection to an easy life, but with all that's going on in the world, I don't know what you're talking about. What news have you got to report? Unfortunately, nothing at all. The blonde was very uncommunicative. You wouldn't think so. Tell me, are you jealous? Me? You like that blonde type, huh? No, she's absolutely repulsive. You know our employer is interested in girls. And who's that? I shouldn't tell you. Jacques Mauirier. But baby, if you enjoy your work, everything is easier. Oh, yes, I know. You don't need to be afraid, you won't come off badly. Oh, the blonde is no competition for me. And even if she were, unfortunately, I would really have to look for another occupation in my hours of leisure. Kiss me. You can, now go on. I'll stay and talk to Mr. Vic as while you're gone. - All right, please excuse me. - Hurry up, get going. You are leaving us already? I don't think that's nice of you. You haven't even had a drink yet. Yes, I'm sorry, but I have an appointment. So? Well, things certainly go fast with you. You've only just arrived. Who do you know here? But whether you believe it or not, I'm always expected at the harbor. That is, I would believe you gladly, but in your place I would nevertheless be careful. You see, not everyone here is as nice as |I. No? Then I must look out so that nothing happens to me. Treat my friend well. My baby's the best one. Yes? And how should I do it? Well, that's not so difficult. You must be a bit nice to me. Hello. Well... Then let's get started. What do you intend to do? Are you free this evening? Sorry. Not anymore. I'm together with you now, aren't I? Shall we? Well, why not? Let's go. Shall we go? Then I must first ask where to, and second, why? Well, if you think about it a bit, you'll find out. Won't you, sweetie? My friend will think that you're my weak point. Oh, that wouldn't worry me. Deadly silence, right? Hmm? Did you want to come with me? No, but I didn't have anything better to do. Then I'll squeeze tight. Do it. Just a minute. I'll take my time. I'm a pleasure seeker. Then it would be best if you let me live. Too late. That won't do. Because I'm really going to Kill you. I'm not afraid of death. Once and for all, tell me what you know. Start talking. I can't if you squeeze my throat. If you'll loosen your grip a little and tell me for whom you work. For a foreign power. I could be a madman, too. Bravo. Wasn't badly played, that number. Just a bit drawn out. May I introduce you? Senorita Yolanda. Diana. Oh, the goddess of the hunt is standing by my armchair. Please, take a seat. Thank you. Can I come in with you for just a minute? Be a good boy and go to sleep so that you'll be fresh tomorrow. We'll be here for a few days yet. You rang, miss? No, what gives you that idea? You're right. Let's be frank with each other. If you're sensible, we can work together and that would be interesting for you, 100. But if you're not sensible, I will convince you that you must work for me. He's very good at that. Believe me. I believe everything you say. Perhaps it would be interesting for me, but I don't know how I'm supposed to help him. I think you know very well how you can help him. But if you don't, we'll gladly give you a few explanations. You will answer every question my mistress asks you. Exactly. Otherwise, you get whipped. Do you understand? Yes. Who is your real employer? How did you come to the Abilenes? And what do you actually know about Professor Bertrand? Actually, nothing, but perhaps I can find out something from you. Tell me. You must answer when we ask! What do you know about Bertrand? Surely, you've already heard of Professor Bertrand. Now, I must ask you seriously to tell me everything. All right. All I know about your fabulous Professor Bertrand is that he was a great scientist and that many people are interested in the result of his research. And where might they be? I don't know. I don't know anything! I don't know anything about Bertrand! I just wanna finally get the hell out of here! You're lying to me! We are making you an offer and money is no object. Only if you tell me everything. Bertrand had an assistant, Jacques Mauirier. They worked well together, he was a gifted man. One day, a dead woman was found on the beach with wounds from a recent operation. Bertrand was suspected, accused. The evidence against him was plain and he couldn't refute it, and so he was condemned to death. But before the sentence could be carried out, he disappeared without leaving a trace. And the formula, and the nutrition solution which are integral parts of his formula, must be somewhere on this island. I like you very much. I would be sorry if you had to die. But I know nothing. You must think about what you're doing. We have plenty of time. Perhaps you'd like to spend the night in there. No, it's so uncomfortable in here. Better than dead. I really think we've had far too much patience with you, my child. I'm grateful for that. You don't know Bulumba. She's devoted to me and carries out my orders. Oh, this is ridiculous! Why don't you believe me? It's exactly the way I've told you. Since we've arrived here, absolutely nothing has happened to bring us a single step further. A few times, someone has tried to contact us. In a nice way, of course. Not like you here. That is everything I can tell you. Even if the dear, sweet Bulumba cuts me to pieces. Hold it, wait! Bulumba, I believe her. A miracle has finally happened. I hope we'll come to an understanding. We'll see about it. Batana, set her free. Professor Bertrand was an idealist. He wanted to change humanity. In his scientific work, he concentrated on the improvement of suggestion methods through condition reflexes in the young child and through the use of special drugs. His aim was to create a foolproof system of aging. Let's say, in a word, to create a human artificially and to find the rules for their norm. Incredible. Yes, he was a great man and his work must be continued. At first, when you came into contact with this matter, a messenger brought something to you. What was it? Tell me. What was it? A score. Indeed, the score of a very famous, old Abilenian folk song. So, you do see. Please, excuse me. I'm very happy that you belong to us now. What was all that monkey business for? You must know, we modern women must stick together. Of course, we'll stick together. Modern women. That sounds good. I don't think it's anything to smile about. We women in this world have a heavy burden to bear. We must prevent many things. But sister, take your time. All men cause gross misconducts. And afterwards, we have to straighten out what they have done. A stop must be put to it. Of course it must. And for that reason, we have come together on this island far away from these barbarians. Without men? No! Mm-hmm. Yes, completely without men. Oh, girls! Why, that's wonderful! We have a farewell gift for you. Here, take it. Oh, this is marvelous! First, you lock me up, then you give me a present. And finally, I want to betray a secret to you. The man who died in the bar, there, where you had performed, was not... Bertrand, but Jacques Maurier. Maurier? Who is this Maurier? Excuse me, please. I must bring you back. And you have no clues as to where that might be? No, you will help us with it. We are working together. Yeah, sure, but at the moment, I really don't know how I can help you. Look, it's very difficult to keep the extracted ovary alive. On top of that, the question of further development, the optimum temperature, the viscosity. All this points to the fact that he must have hidden that nutrition solution somewhere. And in two cases, he succeeded with this experiment as you know. You mean that he really created two fully developed physical beings artificially? Yes, but without developing intelligence along with it. They are like dogs. I failed. He won't give up. I can't do it! Never! Our plan must be realized by any means. Why? You know why. If we had an army of men like Andros I and Andros ll, we would be powerful. Very powerful. Why do you keep on forcing me? You know there's no point. I can't manage it. Yes, you can. If we have the formula and the nutrition solution which Bertrand left... You are dead, you have nothing left to fear. Won't go along with it. You will do what I tell you. You will bring the two girls here and quickly. Where have you been? Have you been here long? Yes, I've been asleep. I had a terrible dream I was taken prisoner by a group of queer virgins and was put in a cage. One of them worked me over with a whip. Then they let me out again and they gave me a funny kind of whistle or something as a farewell present. This here? Hey, where did you find it? Where was it? On the table. Aha, Amubio. What? Now also in a spray form. A super quick-acting narcotic out of a tin. Then I wasn't dreaming. I was there! Regina, you really weren't dreaming. Your virgins do exist. What a nice surprise. But I experienced another kind of surprise and not a very pleasant one. Vic as took me with him to his apartment and there was a girl waiting for us there. A sort of elephant. Yes, and then what happened? General fraternization. They made me an offer to work with them and I said yes. Your business morals are really unsurpassable. Just friends everywhere, then little mousey can dream. Princess! Princess! Princess! Bring her in! I'm sorry for her. I don't think I'll operate on her. Maurier, no sympathy! She betrayed us to the girls. She has deserved nothing better. You will carry out your experiment exactly as we had planned at the very beginning. All right, I'll do it. I don't know whether I'll manage it, though. Take her away, get her ready. Now, you mustn't be hesitant. Of course, you'll manage it without Bertrand. You know just as much, have faith in yourself. I'll try it once more. And then if...? There's no going back now! Do it for me. Be quiet, I need absolute quiet! I'm sorry, Dimitri. I'm on edge. I can't trust my hands anymore. Forceps. Forceps. Scalpel. Scalpel. Number seven. Number seven. Andros, take care of the other one. Damn it, she's too weak. Stop it, Andros! You will do what I tell you! Stop it. That's enough. Carry on, Andros. Carry on. We mustn't give in now under any other circumstances. I don't understand your inhibitions. Why are you so jittery? Ooh. We'll take her over. Linda. We don't need you anymore. What do you mean? I have the same right to find out what she knows as you have. After all, I brought her here, didn't 1? Do as I tell you. You know I won't be contradicted. You have a big mouth. I don't mind that as long as I get paid. Go, Linda. We really don't need you here. All right, I understand. But I'm used to being decently paid for my work. I brought my share to the business. And we shall finish it successfully. And what do you mean by that, Dimitri? She must go. By all means. No, keep your hands off of her. It won't be my hands. You know that. We've got Andros. Linda! Are you all right? Answer me! The blonde! The girl! Maurier! My head, my head. What kind of a... It will mend. Now we're in for it. Now, again comes the question. Where is the formula? What do I know? Oh, my poor head. Yes, where is the formula? Man, you're boring me. Stop it. Gradually, I'm really getting the feeling that there's nothing else in this world but that silly rubbish. I don't know where it could be! If you were sensible you could make a lot of money. And then I can buy myself a nice fur coat. Oh, tell me, you look like Bertrand. Well, the truth is I'm Jacques Maurier. You can't imagine the trouble we've had. You were once dead. That wasn't meant so seriously. Knife in his back and still alive. Little rascal, aren't you? There was no other way. There were a few friends after me and the best way of getting rid of them IS when you're dead. You have friends? I don't believe you. Please, answer our questions, now won't you? My patience is running out! Get your hand off my shoulder. You make me all nervous. I don't like brutal men around me. Now, say what you know! This is your last chance. My last chance? Have you been experimenting with him? He's really a serious case there. All right, then, if that's the way you want it, I'll hand you over to Andros II and he will... He will take you home. You do want to go home...? No, I won't allow it. - Yes, why not? - I wanna go to bed. She's really a very nice girl. She wants to go to bed and we'll let her go. It's out of the question. I'm sure she knows where the formulas are. Now, what's the matter? Are you going to let me go? Yes. Yes, naturally, we'll let her go. Oh! Well, what are you waiting for? Come on, will you? Excuse me, please. Taxi, ladies? Yes, to the hotel. Where'd you pick that up? Real nice, huh? Yeah, where did you learn it? Everybody knows it. Come over here. Yes. In the song, it's called The Mill of The Black Devil. The secret sect of the Abilenes was founded by the Dutch. And what did they do when they got to the island? They built windmills. I'd been gathering a bit of information and I came across this trace. You mean there's a connection? Shall we search all the windmills? Why not? Perhaps we'll find something that will help us. Yes, what could help us? The best thing would be to look for the formula which Bertrand hid. Yes, look. What's that over there? Where? Over there, that strange sign. There! Yes, that reminds me of something. Go on, have a closer look. Okay. Hmm. Nothing special. Just some cogwheels that have come loose. Perhaps the sails can be moved. No, I don't think so. It's been standing still for a long time. I can try it, but I'm sure there's no sense to it. Everything inside is completely rusted. But we are on the right track. The mill of the black devil. There are some more mills on this island. Why does it have to be this particular one, hmm? I don't know. The seal. It's similar to the one on our score. What kind of seal? Yes, it works like a sundial. Quite simple. A combination of figures according to the score. The sails are the hands. What do you mean? It's a bit warm today. So, for example, let's assume it's C-D-E-F-G, that would be one, two, three, four, five. Oh, Regina. Why not? Let someone else think. There's no point to it. You mean that won't do? No. Oh, pity. Why not, actually? It could be that it works. That's it! Oh, my angel, you are a genius! You are wonderful! Imagine we're looking for a combination of a safe or something like that. Then the 12 would have to be at the top there. And all the rest works according to the sundial system. And when we find the right combination, it clicks. Yes, as I said, the sails move according to the notes on the score. Let us give it a try. You are right. D. F. G. A-C. A. G. B D-F. E. C. Four. Six. Eight. Three. Well? Five. Five! Six. Nothing. Nothing. What now? No ideas. It's continuing! We've done it. Yeah. We'll be rich! The heritage of Professor Bertrand. A dangerous inheritance. Dangerous not only for this world. This uncovers the secret of life. For the one who possesses it, it can mean only his or her death. We have it! We've done it, now come on. Get in! Yeah! Thank you. Stay here! - Andy! - Andy! - Andy, wait! - Wait! Oh, what a swindler! I hope all his tires burst. It's already happened! Yeah. Oh. Who was it, Andy? Answer me, can you hear me? Did you see anyone? No. Nobody. I didn't think, I just wanted money. I'm just a lousy swindler. I didn't think I'd get caught. Poor boy. I'm really sorry for him. Hard luck for him. Wasn't as clever as he looked. But sympathetic. We thank you. I was always convinced that you would manage it. We shall reward you. You have deserved it. Hand over the crate. Go on. Stop! Get back! Sorry. The Abilenes are not traitors, believe me. But our society was wiped out and we must start afresh. This is our chance. You'll be paid when we gain power. That won't be necessary! Keep your money. Hand over the crate. Who are you? Take a guess. Interpol? Just imagine. My number is XP-347-10. In case you want to lodge a complaint. Now, give her the crate. Get down, girls! You saw it. He tried it first. Now, grab that crate and come on, girls. You gotta make a fast retreat. Thank you. Thank you. Careful with that precious thing. There's a step. Are you from Interpol? Yes. And you're wonderful decoys. Just had to throw out the line and already the fish were biting, ladies. Not bad. Yes, he is a really talented man. If you think he sits around in the bar all the time, plays with little girls, lets others do the work, and yet in the end, he gets what he wants. My highest esteem. I bet he'll get a promotion for this job. Yes, you are quite right. I think I've taken care of that. Just stop a moment. Is it really necessary? I asked you to stop. Hmm? All right, then, if you must, but it's absolutely senseless. Give up. Why is it senseless? Well, we're already there. Well, goodnight. Goodnight. What do you mean by that? I was just thinking about it. So long? Look here. It's like this. All three of us have worked hard and now we're sitting here together. And after all, one gets a little... Tired. Tired men bore us. What have we done to deserve this punishment? You know, we scientists are used to working a lot at night. Actually, I start to wake up only about one o'clock in the morning. Yes, yes, we scientists. But I can't wait until one o'clock. That's much too late. Come, give me a kiss. I'm just going to tell you a secret, but please don't pass it on. Understand? Oh, what have we got ourselves into here? A complete flop. That's all we needed. She misunderstood something. Yes? Well I didn't mean it like that at all. Mmm-mmm-mmm! - Mm-hmm. - Mm-hmm. First class, isn't he? Come on, up into the hotel. And then nothing to do but to go home. See to the plane tickets straight away. ( Okay, will do. It's very dangerous to interfere with things that don't concern you. Just a minute! Stay here, McClune. I Know you don't like It, but I can't consider that. After all, you know that our chief... I just wanted to get a breath of fresh air. You don't need me here at the hearing. Don't tell me any stories. Sit down. I think I'll have to write a report. Please. But gentlemen, I think it would be better if we continued our conversation peacefully. Yes. I'll write a report, too. First, you burst into here unannounced. Second, so late, then there are difficulties of competence, because one is higher IN rank and the other isn't. Interpol is a funny kind of outfit. Yes. Very funny. But in order to save the honor of these poor policemen, I have to confess that I have as little to do with Interpol as you have. In other words, nothing at all. Oh, I am Professor Bertrand. And I should like to thank the two ladies for bringing back my property to me. I know it was rather a strange way of putting you on this track, but it worked superbly. When my messenger brought you the score, I was still in doubts as to whether you would succeed. But to my reassurance, I was soon able to ascertain how extraordinarily capable you are. May I now ask for my property? I'm very sorry. He forced me to bring him here. But I had no other choice. No, he really couldn't do anything else. Will you please get the crate now? You are mad! We haven't got it! Take a look for yourself! Calm down, my child. All that is a waste of time. There, you see? Now, come slowly over here. Throw that revolver away, or I'll let it fall. Wonderful! McClune, you are the greatest! You are a hero, you were wonderful! What's the matter? Come on, let's get out of here. Really, it's a pity. He was just in the mood. Thanks. What'll we do with the crate? We can't drag it around all the time. Hey, I've got a marvelous idea. We'll hire a few scientists. And then? - You're slow on the uptake. - For example? We'll fix ourselves up a little nutrition solution, get ourselves an army for love, and we'll join up with the hippies. And all that by the do-it-yourself method. Oh, boy.
