(WHISPERING) (SPANISH) Amén. ♪ And I never thought I'd be the boy... ♪ Can you believe it? Ugh. They gave me a ticket for parking the engine in front of a hydrant. No, no, no, I was not on a call. I was getting a sandwich to go, but that's not the point. You're not listening. The point is, you can't give a fireman a ticket, because he parks a fire truck in front of a hydrant. I gotta go. I gotta finish cooking breakfast for my kids. (SPANISH) Okay, prayer. Dear God, thank you for this food and for the man who made it. Thanks for my, uh, beautiful daughter's painting, and my wife's beautiful dress. Am I forgetting something? Oh! My son, for his confirmation. We're all very proud of him, and for the awesome wave we just made. All right! Amen. Why do we have to waste our time at church? I can confirm Alex right now. I confirm that Alex Duran has a crush on... Lia Abram. What? I do not! You got a girlfriend, buddy? Congratulations. You are crazy. You are absolved from all your sins. Okay. Now you're absolved from all your sins! Ay, Alicia! Sorry, Daddy. Alex, will you go get another carton for me in the garage? And be careful with Grandma's stuff. Did you get lost in here? We're late. Sorry, Dad. What is that? Found it in Grandma's big armoire. There's something inside of it, but no way to open it. That's impossible. Here. Can I have it? Uh, yeah, yeah, sure. Consider it your grandmother's confirmation gift to you. We were supposed to leave by 8:30! Shit! You said the "S" word. That'll cost you $5. You're killing me. What do I owe you now? 45 bucks. Shit. Now it's 50. Pay up, sucker. Hey, I almost forgot to tell you guys. We have rats in the garage. Are they cute? Far from it. Honey, remind me to call the exterminator. Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. I snuck into an R-rated movie with my friends, lied to my parents, disobeyed my mom. What movie did you see? Mad Max. Mmm. I love that film. I'm sorry, Alex. Go on, please. I've had unclean thoughts about a girl. That's normal. It's nothing to be ashamed of. I'm sorry for these and all of my sins. Five Hail Marys, five Our Fathers. You're now absolved from these sins, my son. Thank you, Father. So tell me a little more about this girl. I just keep thinking about her. I've known her since third grade. We grew up together. So you like her now as more than just a friend. I don't know. I mean, I like hanging out with her. She's cool. I think you should flip the script on her. How? Ask her out on a date. I thought priests couldn't date. You're not a priest, Alex, at least not yet. But if you're serious about becoming one, you need to know what it is that you're giving up. Trust me. I know what I'm talking about. I almost got married before I took my vows, back in the military. Alex, I have known you since the day you were born. I baptized you. You're a good kid. So, ask this girl out. See if she's more than just a friend, okay? Thanks, Father. Confirm, O Lord, your servant with your Holy Spirit. Alejandro Duran Delgado. Confirm, O Lord, your servant with your Holy Spirit. Amen. Congratulations and prayers, as you are strengthened by the Holy Spirit. God bless you always. I mean, it's beautiful. Whoever made it is a real craftsman. But see? There's no seams. Whatever's in there must've been sealed from the inside. How do you do that? I don't know. I don't know. Are you sure you want me to cut it open? It may be valuable. I want to find out what's inside. Me too. Let's do it. Be careful, Dad. Are you okay? Yeah, I think so. That was so weird. What happened? I don't know. Wait, wait, wait, look. I wonder whose it was. Who knows? Your grandmother bought and sold old furniture. Could've been anybody's. Why would someone hide it in a box like that? That's a good question. I don't know. But, it's yours now. Let's go, Father Flanagan! What an asshole. As a part of our Bare, Not Legal series, we approach the home of 16-year-old Lia Abrams. We shouldn't do this. Hey, this was your idea, Alex. I wanted to ask her to be in one of our crazy videos, not perv out on her for the Internet. Yeah, man, this isn't cool. We should go. Screw you guys. I'm doing this. Now, we know she's not legal. The big question is, is she bare? Let's find out. There's no one here. It's 10 o'clock, she should be here. Oh, shit, there she is. This isn't right, Everett. Stop recording. Hey, shut up. Look at that. Oh, shit. Come on, Everett, stop recording. Hey, Alex, your dream's coming true. Shut up and turn off the camera. Oh, you like it, come on. I said stop it now! What the... Come on, dude! What the fuck? Come on! Alex? I tried to stop him. I expect that shit from him, but not you. He'll delete it. I promise. I'll make sure of it myself. You better. You're watching it again? Told you she had a nice body. We should just keep it. Tell her you deleted it. I'm not gonna lie to her. I made her a promise. No, no, don't! Don't delete that! Wait, wait! Oh, fuck! Hi. Did he delete it? He deleted it. Swear to God? You know I can't do that, but I promise. I made sure of it myself. So you watched it. Um... You look guilty, Alex. Is there something you need to confess? Okay, I watched it, but only to make sure that he didn't... I didn't know you were such a bad boy, Alex. I'm not. All right, bad boy, I got to go. Good night. Wait. What are you doing Saturday night? Are you asking me out on a date? Yeah, I am. I thought we were just friends. Uh, I mean, we are, but... Pick me up at seven. I don't have my license yet. Yeah, right, um... I'll pick you up at seven. Okay. Bye. Bye. Are you contagious? No, I don't think so. If you're contagious, you need to sanitize everything you touch. It's just an upset stomach. I think you have Ebola. I don't have Ebola. Look, just tell Father Cutler I'll be right down. Father Cutler, Alex says he'll be right down! O Holy Hosts above, I call upon thee as a servant of Jesus Christ to sanctify our actions this day in preparation for the fulfillment of the will of God. We ask you that you receive this child into your arms, that she may pass in safety from this crisis. (SPANISH) She wants to know if she's going to heaven. Tell her to trust in the Lord, Alex. He always looks out for his children. (SPANISH) By this sign, thou art absolved from all past errors, free to take your place in the world He's prepared for us, to dwell in the house of the Lord forever. Amen. Amen. Ow! Goddamn it! Alex! Uh, sorry, Mom. I don't know why I said that. Where did you get that? Uh, I found it in Grandma's armoire. Why? It was your grandfather's. Mom, Alex! Show starts in 10 seconds! Ten, nine... Let's go. Eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one! I can't believe you let him keep it. How was I supposed to know it was your father's? It was in some stupid wooden box. Marcos... (SPANISH) My father was a carpenter. Of course it was his. Now every time I look at it, I have to think about what happened. I'm not comfortable with Alex having it. I know, I know. What do you want me to do? (SPANISH) If I take it away from him, he's going to ask why. Lucia. Lu... I'm so fucking pissed at you. Lucia. (SPANISH) I don't like him wearing it. I know. I know, Baby, neither do I. But you know what can happen if he starts to ask questions. He might remember what your dad did to him. Do we want that? Okay. I'll let him keep it, for now. Okay. Okay. "I'm so fucking pissed at you." I love you. I'm so sorry. I love you. Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. (WHISPERS) (WHISPERING) (SPANISH) No. (WHISPERING) (WHISPERING) Huh? God is a liar! Alex! What's wrong? Are you okay? Honey, what happened? There was someone in here. What? Son, there's no one in here. You guys scared me, Daddy. Oh, sorry, Baby. Come here, come here. Are you okay? Did you wake up? I don't know what happened. It was dark, and he was hiding in my closet. He spoke to me. I think we need to call the police. Wait, wait, what did he say? He said, "God is a liar." Maybe it was a nightmare. It wasn't a fucking nightmare! I was awake! Let's get you to bed. It's okay, Honey. Come on. Shh, shh, shh. Honey, are you okay? Yeah. I'm okay. Promise you'll wake me if you need anything. Yeah. I love you. Love you too. Yo, we should get Alex a hooker for his birthday. Aren't they expensive? No, dude. You can get one for like 60 bucks off the Internet. How do you know? That is disgusting. Hey, yo, Alex, it's gonna suck when you gotta retire from the pussy patrol, bro. That's why you got to have as much sex as you can before they cut it off. Right, Alex? What? Yeah. I mean, no, they don't cut it off. Does it matter? You can never use it again. Maybe giving up sex won't be such a big deal. How the fuck do you know? You don't even know what you're giving up. That's savage, Gavin. Why do you want to be a priest anyway, dude? Yeah, man, I mean, becoming a priest, you gotta admit, that shit's pretty weird. I told you guys. I want to help people. There's a million ways to help people and still bang bitches. You're a real Neanderthal, aren't you? Do you guys believe in ghosts? Yo, you're tripping off that beer, lightweight. Might wanna put that shit down. No, seriously, do you believe in ghosts? Um, I do. I believe in ghosts. I thought I saw one once after my dad died. Why, man? Seeing ghosts? No. I was just wondering. So the thing is, I learned something when I decided to be a dog owner, and the biggest kind of, like, epiphany that I had was that you have to do things to keep it alive. Don't you? Yes, it's true. You have to feed it, then you have to walk it, then you have to trim the nails. So, a comedy album, is that your big move with all the girls? What girls? If you're ever going to have a shot with any other girls, you're going to need to get some game. Oh, yeah? Like what? Well, most of the girls I know like bad boys, so instead of taking them out to dinner, take them out for a drink. I'm not old enough to buy alcohol. Come on, Alex, don't be such a pussy. You need to let your inner bad boy out and lose the comedy album. Play something that's going to get them in the mood. ♪ I hate that I love you ♪ Hurts to stay away...

Watch your mouth! But what you hate most is that I'm smarter than you. You know it's true. Mom knows it too. You should just see the way she looks at you sometimes, what she says to her friends behind your back. No wonder your father beat the shit out of you. What did you say? No, wait. No, please!

You apologize to your mother! Fuck you! Motherfucker! Fuck! Do you know why you're here? We've seen each other before. Do you remember me? You were five years old. We had a few sessions. Why would a 5-year-old boy need to see a psychiatrist? Your parents were worried about you, because you were drawing scary pictures. Your parents tell me that you've been having trouble sleeping. I've been hearing... I've been having nightmares where I hear a voice whispering to me. It pretends to... It? I mean, "He." And what does the voice say to you? It... It curses God. Doctor? Yes, Alex. You said I was drawing scary pictures. What kind of scary pictures? (WHISPERING) (WHISPERING) Hey, Alex. Hey. What's up? I wanted to apologize for the other day. It's okay. You don't have to apologize. Can you come out? Uh, yeah. I'll pick you up. All right. I'll be ready. Bye. How many people do you think are down there? I don't know. Do you think any of them are worth it? What? You look really good tonight. You always look good. Thanks, Alex. That's really sweet. I'm sorry again about the other day, for acting so crazy. It's just... It's okay. You know, we all go a little crazy sometimes. You just looked so hot in that bikini. And when I saw you with Gavin, I... I couldn't take it. Well, I like that you got jealous. (WHISPERING) Ow. Hey. (WHISPERING) What the fuck is wrong with you? Sorry. I don't know what's happening to me. (WHISPERING) Alejandro? You scared me. (SPANISH) Can I ask you a question about my grandfather? What about him? Was he a religious man? Not always. He became religious later in life. That's when he started to wear that crucifix. He thought it protected him. He had psychological problems, and he was never treated for them. He hurt people, and religion was his way of dealing with his guilt. What did he do? Sometimes people do things that they're ashamed of. They want to be good, but they're just not in control. How did he die? He hung himself. I'm scared, Father. What are you scared of? Alex? Do you believe in demons? I believe that demons, evil spirits, and the devil himself represent man's darkest desires. We all have impulses, Alex, impulses that weaken us and lead us astray. I've been having these... Experiences. And I just don't know how to explain them. Alex, I had... I had some deep emotional problems when I came back from the war. These types of experiences are most often psychological manifestations of a deeper problem. So you're saying these things are all in my head? I want you to talk to your therapist about this. And trust her, Alex, trust her. And know that I'm always here for you, if you need me. But what if they are real? Gracious Heavenly Father, in Jesus Christ's name, I ask for your help in a young man's time of need. (WHISPERING) O Lord, Jesus Christ, I pray for the wisdom and the power of your Holy Spirit and the presence of your Holy Angels. God is a liar. (WHISPERING) (WHISPERING) (WHISPERING) Shh... (SPANISH) (WHISPERING) No! (WHISPERING) No! (WHISPERING) (WHISPERING) Surprise! Sixteen! I can't believe it. We are so proud of you. Cut! I'm making a comedy, not a drama! Hey! Here comes the hug monster! No! Yuck, Daddy! It's so cool. Oh, my God, it's so great. Happy birthday, Alex. What are you guys doing here? Your parents invited us. Do you want us to leave? No. It's just I thought you guys hated me. We can never hate you, man. You're family. I'm really sorry for the way I acted and what I did. We're here for you, Alex, all of us. I have to tell you something. In private. Okay, yeah. Come on, man. You're just fucking with us. I'm being serious, Everett. It's real. It's haunting me. I think it haunted me when I was a little boy, and now it's back. Have you spoken with your therapist about this? No. There's nothing she can do for me. What do you think it is? It's an evil spirit. And what the hell does an evil spirit want with you? It wants to possess me. ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ Happy birthday, dear Alex ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ Make a wish, Honey. The doctors called it a cryptogenic stroke. That only means they can't find a cause. When you left confession, Alex, I was worried about you. While I was praying, I heard things, and I saw things, and I felt something, feelings I haven't had since the war. What kind of things? The kind of things you only tell your priest in confession. Have you ever heard of the phrase, "In these demonic shadows of evil spirits "shall rise up against the children of men"? It's from the Book of Enoch. It's an ancient religious work ascribed to Enoch, the great grandfather of Noah. But it's not considered biblical canon, at least not by the Catholic church. I always thought they were just cautionary stories. But now... Now I don't know what to believe. Alex, have you told anyone else about this? (WHISPERING) Alex? No, no, no! I don't want to see. Mom? (WHISPERING) Please don't make me watch. (WHISPERING) Mom? (WHISPERING) Alex. It's okay, Alex. Just relax. We have to fight this. Just calm yourself down. You need to be strong. Mom, is... Is that you? Mom? (WHISPERING) (WHISPERING) Help! Help! I spoke with the Bishop. That was a mistake. Alex, the diocese has experts, priests who specialize. They'll conduct an investigation. How long will that take? It's not an exact science. These things take time. I don't have time. You can't give up, Alex. You need to stay strong. Evil strikes when we're weakest. It feeds on negative feelings, fear, regret. We're up against something very powerful, very dangerous and deadly. The only way to fight back is with strength. Our community has suffered a terrible tragedy. And you may ask why has God done such an awful thing. But know this, death will not have the last word. For Jesus Christ conquered death. Jesus rose. And we too shall rise in the afterlife. "Thus has the whole Earth been filled with blood "and with iniquity. "The souls of those who are dead cry out, "and the giants shall be called upon Earth's evil spirits. "They shall rise up against the children of men "in order to devour them. "For they come forth during the days of slaughter and destruction." Alex, can I come in? Yeah. I'm scared. Don't be scared. I won't let anything bad happen to you. I promise. I love you. I love you too. Good night. (WHISPERING) (WHISPERING) (WHISPERING) I won't do it. I won't hurt her. I said no! (WHISPERING) (WHISPERING) Oh, my God! Alex! Oh, my God, no! No! Alex, why? Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Why? Why? Let go. Let me put him down. He's all right. He's all right. Breathe, breathe, that's it. Breathe. He's coming around. Hi, son. Alex, hi, Baby. We're here. Am I... Am I dead? It's okay. We're here with you. I'm supposed to be dead. You're okay. His pulse is good. Okay. Why did you save me? You're just a little disoriented, Alex. You're gonna be fine. You've been through a lot. Just rest. Where's my crucifix? Don't worry. We have it. Give it to me. I need it. Mom, give it to me. It's the only thing protecting me. Okay, okay. Here. There you go. You and Dad and Alicia... You're in danger. As long as I'm alive, no one close to me is safe. Shh. We're okay, Baby. Everyone's okay. You don't understand. There's something after me. It's coming for all of us. What's coming for us? I... I can't tell you, but it won't stop until it has me. Please believe me. Please, just believe me. Just let me die. Just please let me die! No, honey. Honey, let go, let go. You're hurting yourself. No. You're hurting yourself, son. I'm trying to help you. Stop! No! Just please let go. Get off of me! Mom, stop it! Get off of me! Hold him down. Mom, stop! Mom, let go of me! Mom, please stop! Mom! Mom, please! I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. All right, all right. That's it. We're done. It's okay, Baby. It's okay. You're okay. Do you think you can help our son? It's just that, um, we're concerned that this might have something to do with what happened to Alex when he was a child. You refer to the molestation by his grandfather. Yeah. I believe it does. His repressed memory is very likely the cause of his recent issues. I knew we should have continued these sessions 10 years ago, but my husband felt that Alex was okay. Oh, please, Alex was fine. He was acting normal. I knew it was the wrong decision. I think we need to focus on what we can do for Alex now. I agree. Sorry. His past trauma can no longer be ignored. It's time for him to face his repressed memories. How do you feel? I feel good, Father. See, Dr. Dian made me understand that I have... Issues. Issues that I'll have to deal with for the rest of my life. But I've come to terms with that. The demon I was seeing? It never really existed. It was just my imagination, a subconscious way for me to deal with the things that happened to me when I was a little boy. It was just like you said. It was all in my head. What we experienced was real. You can't ignore it. If you do, it will destroy you. I should go. Alex, please, you need to listen to me. In the darkest of times, it becomes difficult to distinguish God from the devil. Alex. Alex! How are you two holding up? Oh, we're pretty good. I'm... I'm tired. So tired. But I'm happy that Alex is getting through this. He's been through so much. We just want to go back to being a normal family again, you know? I wanna put this behind us. Marcos, this will always be part of Alex for the rest of his life, but he's learned how to live with it. Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name, Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven. (WHISPERING) Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespassed against us, and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen. (WHISPERING) (WHISPERING) Hello and welcome. I want to thank my brother Alex, my father Marcos, and my mother Lucia. Without all of you, this film would not have been possible. Now sit back, relax, and enjoy The Three Dorks. Roll 'em! You're a dork. Here we go. Hold on, I think we just blew a fuse. What about my movie? Don't worry. We'll watch it as soon as the power comes back on. That's strange. We're the only ones who lost power. (VOICES) Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom, get away from the window! Mom! Mommy! Hey! ALEX: Dad! Marcos! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Honey, are you okay? Dad. Dad, are you all right? He's just unconscious. Where's Alicia? Alicia! Alicia? Alicia? Baby, what are you doing? No! Alicia! No! (WHISPERING) No! Oh, my God! Alicia! Alicia, Baby! Oh, my God! No! Please, no! Oh, my God! Stop! No! No. No. No, no, no! No, don't! Take me! I'm the one you want! You wanna take me, take me! Come on! You want me? Take me! Take me! Alicia? Honey, come here. Alicia, come here. Oh, my God! I'm ready to die. No, no! O Holy Hosts above, I call upon Thee as a servant of Jesus Christ to sanctify this day in preparation for the fulfillment of the will of God. O Lord, Jesus Christ, most merciful, I ask You that you wrap Your arms around me that I might pass in safety. By this sign, I am absolved of all past errors, free to take place in the world that He has prepared for us, to dwell in the house of the Lord forever. O Lord, Jesus Christ, most merciful, I ask You that you wrap Your arms around me that I might pass in safety through this. By this sign, I am absolved from all past errors, free to take my place in the world He has prepared for us, to dwell in the house of the Lord forever.

By this sign, I am absolved of all past errors, and I am free to take my place in the world He has prepared for us, to dwell in the house of the Lord forever. What happened? Alex! Mom? Dad? Honey. Mom! Alex. The devil is very real, and he's here amongst us, in our world, ever ready to strike, ready to test our faith. It is our God given birthright to deny the evil one, to refuse to give him his power, to stand up with courage and the will to choose good over evil in our actions. Because in the end, we're stronger than the devil. It's true. He will use all he can to weaken our resolve, but we must not be discouraged. We are stronger. (WHISPERING) (WHISPERING)
