(mellow music) - Psst, psst. Make it fast, I don't want the boss to get wise when he's got one of his tightwad buns on. (chuckles) Jeez, ain't the old bastard a riot when he starts that bull about turning over a new leaf? Not a damn drink on the house, he tells me, and all these bums have got to pay up their rent beginning tomorrow, he says. Jeez, you'd think he meant it. (both chuckling) - I'll be glad to pay up, tomorrow. (Rocky laughing) And I know my fellow inmates will all promise the same. They have a touching credulity concerning tomorrows. It'll be a great day, tomorrow. The Feast of All Fools, with brass bands playing. Why their ships will come in loaded to the gunwales with canceled regrets and promises fulfilled and clean slates and new leases. - Yeah, and a ton of hop. - Don't mock the faith. Have you no respect for religion, you unregenerate wop? (Rocky laughing) What's it matter if the truth is that their favoring breeze has the stink of nickel whiskey on its breath, and that their sea is a growler of lager and ale, and that their ships are long since looted and scuttled and sunk on the bottom? To hell with the truth. Why the history of the world proves that the truth has no bearing on anything. It's irrelevant and immaterial, as the lawyers say. It's the lie of a pipe dream that gives life to the whole misbegotten mad lot of us, drunk or sober. - The old-- - And that's enough philosophical wisdom to give you for one drink of rotgut. - Eh, the old philosopher, like Hickey calls ya, ain't ya? I suppose you don't fall for no pipe dream? - I don't. Mine are all dead and buried behind me. What lies before me is the comforting fact that death is a fine long sleep, and I'm damned tired, and it can't come too soon for me. - The old anarchist wise guy that knows all the answers. That's you, huh? - Ah, you can forget it about the anarchist part of it. I'm through with the Movement long since. I saw that men don't wanna be saved from themselves because then they'd have to give up greed and they'll never pay that price for liberty. Ain't I right, Comrade Hugo? - Oh Christ. - Ain't I telling the truth? - Don't get that bughouse bum started. - Capitalist swine. Bourgeois stool pigeons. Have the slaves no right to sleep even? (Hugo laughs) Hello, little Rocky, little monkey face. How are your little slave girls? Don't be a fool, damn bourgeois wop. Buy me a drink. - (chuckles) He's out again. He's lucky no one take his cracks serious or he'll wake up every morning in a hospital. - No one takes him seriously, that's his epitaph. If I'm through with the Movement long since, it's been through with him, and thanks to whiskey, he's the only one doesn't know it. - I've let him get by with too much. He's gonna pull that slave girl stuff on me once too often. Hell, you'd think I was a pimp or somethin'. Everyone knows me knows I ain't. A pimp don't hold no job. I'm a bartender. Them tarts, Margie and Pearl, they're just a sideline to pick up some extra dough. Strictly business, like they was fighters and I was their manager, see? - Mm-hmm. A shrewd businessman, who never misses an opportunity to get on in the world. That's what I'd call you, Rocky. (Rocky laughing) - Sure thing, that's me. Grab another ball, Larry. You'd never think all these bums had a good bed to go up to upstairs. Scared if they hit the hay they wouldn't be here when Hickey showed up and miss a couple a drinks. That's what kept you up too, ain't it? - It is. And not so much the hope of booze, if you can believe that. I've got the blues and Hickey's a great one to make a joke out of everything and cheer you up. - Yeah, remember how he works up that gag about his wife, when he's cockeyed, cryin' over her picture and then springin' it on ya all of a sudden that he left her in the hay with the iceman? (both chuckling) I wonder what's happened to him. You could set your watch by his periodicals before this. Always got here a couple a days before Harry's birthday party, now he's got till tonight to make it. I hope he shows up soon. This dump looks like the morgue with all these bums passed out. - [Willie] It's a lie. Papa! Papa! - Poor devil. Ah, to hell with pity, it does no good. - Ah, dreamin' about his old man. From what the old-timers say, the old gent sure made a pile of dough in the bucket shop game before the cops got him. Jeez, I've seen him bad before but never this bad. Look at that get up. I ain't seen no one so bad, except Hickey on the end of a couple of his bats. - Eh, it's a great game, the pursuit of happiness. - [Willie] Oh, it's a damned lie! Oh, Papa! - Hey, you. Nix, cut out the noise! - Hey, hey, who's that yellin'? - Willie, Boss, the Brooklyn boys is after him. - Well, then give the poor guy a drink and keep him quiet. Oh, bejeeb, can't I get a wink of sleep in me own back room? - Listen to that blind-eyed, deaf old bastard, will ya? He give me strict orders not to let Willie hang up no more drinks, no matter what. - What's that? Can't hear ya. You're a cockeyed liar, never refused a drink to anyone who needed it bad in my life. Told you to use your judgment. Ah, ought to know better. You're too busy thinking up ways to cheat me. Oh, I ain't as blind as you think. I can still see a cash register, bejeeb. - Oh, sure, Boss. Swell chance fooling you. - I'm wise to you and your sidekick, Chuck. Bejeeb, you're burglars, not barkeeps. Blind-eyed, deaf old bastard, am I? I heard you. Heard you often when you didn't think. You and Chuck laughing behind my back, telling everyone how you throw the money up in the air and whatever sticks to the ceiling's my share. Fine couple of crooks. Bejeeb, you'd steal the pennies from your dead mother's eyes. - Aw, Harry, me and Chuck was only kiddin'. - I'll fire both of you. Bejeeb, if you think you can play me for an easy mark, you came to the wrong house. Nobody ever played Harry Hope for a sucker. - No one but everybody. - Well, at least you could try and keep things quiet. - Give me a drink, Rocky, Harry said it's all right. - Well then grab it, it's right under your nose. - Thank you. - When. Wait! I didn't say, take a bath! Jeez, he's killed a half pint or more. (Willie laughing) - Leave him be, the poor devil. - All right by me. It ain't my booze. - [Joe] Whose booze, give me some. I don't care whose. Where's Hickey, ain't he come yet? What time is it, Rocky, huh? - Gettin' near time to open up. Time you begun to sweep up in the bar. - Aw, if Hickey ain't come, it's time Joe go to sleep again. I was dreamin' that Hickey come in the door, crackin' one of them drummer jokes, and he was wavin' a big bankroll and we was all gonna be drunk for two weeks. Wake up, no luck. Oh, hey Larry, how 'bout that young guy, Parritt, come to look you up last night? Where's he at? - He's up in his room, asleep. - Oh, he had a roll on him when he paid you his room rent, didn't he, Rocky? I seen it. - Yeah, yeah, he flashed it like he forgot and then tried to hide it quick. - Oh, he did, did he? - Yeah, I figured he don't belong, but he said he was a friend of yours. - Well, he's a liar. I wouldn't know who he is if he hadn't told me. His mother and I were friends on the Coast years ago. Oh, you remember reading in the paper about that bombing on the Coast where several people got killed? Well, the only woman they pinched, Rosa Parritt, is his mother. They come up for trial pretty soon, there's no chance for them. She'll get life, I think. I'm telling you this so that you'll know why if Don acts a bit queer, and not jump on him. Must be hard hit, he's her only kid. - [Rocky] Why ain't he out there stickin' by her? - I don't know anything about it and I don't want to know. To hell with the Movement and all connected with it. - Eh, if there's one thing more than another I care nothin' about, it's that sucker game you and Hugo call the Movement. (Joe laughing) Hey, that reminds me of damn fool argument me and Mose Porter has the other night. He was drunk and I'm drunker. He says, he says, "Socialist and Anarchist, "we ought to shoot 'em dead, they all no good bastards." I said, "Hold on, you talk as if "Socialist and Anarchist is the same." "They is," he said, "they both no good bastards." "Oh no, they ain't," I said, "I'll explain you the difference. "Now, you see the Anarchist, well he never works. "He drinks but he never buys, and if he ever gets a nickel, "he blows it in on bombs, wouldn't give you nothin'. "You go ahead and shoot him. "But the Socialist, sometimes, he gets a job, "and if he gets 10 bucks, he is bound by his religion "to split it with you 50/50. "You say, 'How about my cut, Comrade?' "You get your five. "So, you don't shoot no Socialists while I'm around. "That is, not if they got anything. "'Course, if they broke, then they no good bastards too." (all laughing) - Here's your guy, Larry. - Hello, Larry. Hello. - What's up? I thought you'd still be asleep. - I couldn't make it. I got sick of lying awake. - Oh, sit down and join the bums then. Oh, uh, the rules of the house are that drinks may be served at all hours. - Oh, oh, I get you, but hell, I'm just about broke. Oh, I know you guys saw. You think I have a roll, don't you? Well, I don't, I'll show you. See, it's all ones, It's all I've got to live on until I can get a job. You think I fixed up a phony, don't you? Well, you're lucky in the Movement if you have enough to eat. - What's the song and dance about? We ain't said nothin'. - Well, I don't want you to think that I'm a tightwad, that's all. All right, I'll buy you a drink if you want one. - If? Oh man, when I don't want a drink, call the morgue. (Don laughs) Bring the bottle quick, Rocky, before he change his mind. - I'll take a cigar when I go in the bar. What're you havin'? - Nothing, I'm on the wagon. What's the damage? - 15 cents. - Must be some booze. - It's cyanide cut with carbolic acid to give it a mellow flavor. Here's luck. - I guess I'll get back to the bar, catch a couple a winks before opening-up time. - One-drink guy. That well done run dry. No hope, no hope till Harry's birthday party. 'Less Hickey come. Hey Larry! If Hickey come, you wake me up if you got to bat me with a chair. - Who's Hickey? - Oh, he's a hardware drummer, friend of Harry's and all the crowd here. He's a grand guy. He comes here twice a year regularly to go on a periodical drunk and he blows in all his money. - Sure must be hard up for a place to hang out. - Oh, it has its points for him. He never runs into anyone he knows in his business here. - Yes, that's what I want too. Boy, I've been in some dumps on the Coast, but this is the limit. What kind of a joint is this anyway? - What is it? Why, it's the No Chance Saloon. Bedrock Bar, The End of the Line Cafe, The Bottom of the Sea Rathskeller. And nobody here worries about where they're going next, because there's no farther they can go. Don't complain about this place, you'll never find a better for lying low. You're safe here. - Gee, Larry, I was sure glad to find you. I kept saying to myself, if I can only find Larry. He's the one guy in the world who can understand. - Understand? What? - Why, all I've been through. I've never forgotten you, Larry. You were the only friend of Mother's who ever paid attention to me, or even knew I was alive. Hey, you remember you used to take me on your knee and tell me funny stories and make me laugh? You'd ask me questions and take what I said seriously. I guess I got to feeling in the years that you lived with us that you'd taken the place of my Old Man. Hell, that sounds like a lot of mush. - How is it that they didn't pinch you when they got your mother and the rest? - I wasn't around, as soon as I heard the news I went right under cover. - The papers say the cops got 'em all dead to rights. Now, someone in the Movement, on the inside must have sold out and tipped them off. - Yes, I guess that must be true, Larry. It hasn't come out yet who it was, it may never come out. - I'd hate to think of any of the old crowd. Oh, they're all damned fools, I know that, most of them. They're as greedy for power as the worst capitalists they attack, but I'd swear there wasn't a yellow stool pigeon among 'em. - Yes, I'd swear that too, Larry. - I hope he rots in hell, whoever it is. - Yes, so do I. - How did you locate me? - Mother. I found out where she had hidden your letters in her flat and I snuck up there one night right after they made the arrest. - Never would have thought she was a woman to save letters. - Oh, it's funny how Mother kept in touch with you for so long. When she's through with anyone, she's finished. Always been real proud of that. What made you leave the Movement, Larry? Was it on account of Mother? - Don't be a damned fool, I had a lot of good reasons. Myself for one. Another one was my comrades, and the last, the breed of swine called men in general. As for myself, I was forced to admit, after 30 years' devotion to the Cause, that I was never made for it. I was one of those born condemned to be, to one who sees all sides to every question. When you're damned like that, the questions multiply for you until in the end, it's all questions and no answers. To be a worldly success at anything, especially revolution, you have to wear blinders like a horse and see only straight in front of you. You've got to see that this is all black, and this is all white. As for my comrades in the Great Cause, I felt about them as Horace Walpole did about England, that he could love it if it weren't for the people in it. (Don laughs) Well, at any rate, you can see that it had nothing to do with your mother. - What have you been doing all the years since you left the Coast, Larry? - Nothing that I could help doing. If I don't believe in the Movement anymore, I don't believe in anything else either. I'm a philosophical old bum, and I'm proud of it. Now, you listen to me. I've hoped you've deduced that I have my reasons for answering the impertinent questions of a stranger, and that's all you are to me. I have a feeling that you're looking for the answer to something from me. Well, let me warn you right at the start so there won't be any misunderstanding, I have no answer for anybody for anything, not even myself. Unless you can call what Heine wrote in his poem to morphine an answer. "Lo, sleep is good, better is death, in sooth, "the best of all were never to be born." (Don chuckling) - That's a hell of an answer. Still, you never know when it might come in handy. - I don't suppose you've had much chance to get any news from your mother since she's been in jail? - No, no chance. Anyway, I don't think she wants to hear from me. We had a fight just before that business happened. She bawled me out for going around with tarts. That got my goat, coming from her. She said I was losing interest in the Movement, and that I was paying too much attention to outside things. - Were you? - The days grow hot, O Babylon, 'Tis cool beneath thy willow trees. Rotten damned stool pigeon! - What, what do you? You drunken bum, you can't call me that! - [Larry] Hey! (Hugo laughing) - Hello, little man. Little monkey face, I did not recognize you. You have grown big boy. - Yes. - How is your mother? Where you come from? Don't be a fool! Loan me a dollar! Buy me a drink! (Don chuckling) - Passed out again. Oh, I should have remembered, whenever Hugo gets soused, he calls everybody a stool pigeon. Well, I've always had a lot of respect for Hugo. I always stood up for him when people in the Movement panned him for a no-good drunken has been. He had the guts to serve 10 years in the can in his own country and get his eyes ruined in solitary for what he did. I'd like to see some of them stick that. Well, tell me some more about this dump, Larry. Who are all these tanks anyway? How about that guy over there trying to catch pneumonia? - Oh, that is Captain Lewis, one-time hero of the British Army. He strips this way to display the scar that he got from a native spear when he's completely soused. The bewhiskered bloke opposite him is General Wetjoen. The two of them met when they went to work in the Boer War spectacle at the St. Louis World's Fair and they've been bosom pals ever since. They dream their hours away in happy dispute over the great days in South Africa when they tried to murder each other. The little fella back here, he was there too, correspondent for a British newspaper. A nickname for him here is Jimmy Tomorrow. He's the leader of our Tomorrow Movement. - [Don] Well, what do they do for a living? - Oh, as little as possible. They live on free lunch and their old friend, Harry Hope, who doesn't give a damn what anyone does or doesn't do, as long as he likes you. - It must be a tough life. - I don't know. Don't pity them, they won't thank you for it. They manage to get drunk, by hook or crook, and hold on to their pipe dreams, which is all they ask out of life. It isn't often that a man attains the true goal of his heart's desire. That goes for Harry Hope too. He's so satisfied with life that he hasn't set foot out of this place since his wife died 20 years ago. Has no need for the outside world at all. This place does a fine trade from the Marketplace across the street and the dock workers, so in spite of Harry's great thirst and his generous heart, he comes out even. He doesn't have to worry about hard times because of his old friends when he was a jitney Tammany politician. Don't ask me what his two pals work at because they don't, except at being his lifetime guests. The one facing you is his brother-in-law, Ed Mosher. He used to work for a circus in the ticket wagon. The other one's Pat McGloin, a police lieutenant. But he got too greedy and when the usual police investigation came along, why, he was caught red-handed and thrown off the Force. (Don chuckles) Joe back there, he ran a colored gambling house then, he was a hell of a sport, so they say. Well, that's our whole family circle of inmates, except the two barkeeps and their girlfriends, three ladies of the evening who room on the third floor. - Why omit me from your "Who's Who in Dipsomania," Larry? An unpardonable slight, especially as I am the only inmate of royal blood. Educated at Harvard too. You must have noticed the atmosphere of culture here. My humble contribution. Yes, generous stranger, I trust you're generous. I was born in the purple, the son, but unfortunately not the heir, of the late world-famous Bill Oban, King of the Bucket Shops. A revolution deposed him, conducted by the District Attorney. In fact, not to mince matters, they locked him in the can and threw away the key. - Tough luck. No, I never heard of him. - Never heard? I thought everyone in the world. Why, even at Harvard I discovered my father was well known by reputation. I was accepted socially with all the warm cordiality that Henry Wadsworth Longfellow would have shown a drunken Negress dancing the Cancan at high noon on Brattle Street. (Larry laughs) Harvard was my father's idea. He was an ambitious man, dictatorial too, always tellin' ya what was best for me. I was a brilliant student at law school. My father wanted a lawyer in the family. He was a calculating man, a thorough knowledge of the law close at hand in his house to help him find fresh ways to evade it. But I discovered the loophole of the whiskey and escaped his jurisdiction. Speaking of whiskey, sir, reminds me, and I hope reminds you, that when meeting a prince, the customary salutation is, what'll you have? (Don chuckles) - All you guys seem to think I'm made of dough. - You don't the thirsty look of the impecunious. Ah, pshew! Ah, let us ignore this useless youth, Larry. Let us join in prayer that Hickey, the Great Salesman, will soon arrive bringing the blessed bourgeois long green. Would that Hickey or Death would come. Meanwhile, I will sing a song. A beautiful old New England folk ballad I picked up at Harvard amid the debris of education.

Harry, I'll be quiet, let me stay here. - Rocky, Rocky, I didn't tell you to beat the poor guy up, leave him alone if he's quiet. (Willie laughing) - Harry. Thank you, Harry, you're a good sport. (dramatic music) (bell ringing) (Cecil coughing) - Oh, good heavens, have I been drinking at the same table with a bloody kaffir? - Oh, hello, Captain. You comin' up for air? Kaffir? Who's he? - Kaffir? (Piet groans) Kaffir? That's a nigger, Joe. (Cecil chuckles) That's a joke on him, Joe, he don't know you. (chuckles) The poor bloody Limey, he's still blind drunk. Ah, ya, ya, ya, great mistake I missed him at the Battle of Modder River. You know, with my rifle I shoot plenty of foolish Limey officers, but him, I miss him. (chuckles) Ach, the pity of it. You, Cecil, wake up you bloody fool, don't you know your old friend, Joe? He's no damned kaffir, Joe is, he's white. - My profound apologies, Joseph, old chum. The eyes was a trifle blurry, you know. Well, you're the whitest colored man I ever knew. I'm proud to call you friend. No hard feelings, what? - Oh, no Captain, I know it's mistake. You's regular, even if you is a Limey. (Cecil laughing) But I don't stand for no nigger from nobody. In the old days, people call me nigger wakes up in the hospital. - Yeah. The old days in the Transvaal, I was so tough and so strong, I grab by the axle an ox cart with a full load and lift it like feather. - Yes, as for you, my balmy Boer that walks like a man, I say again, it was a grave error in our foreign policy ever to let you go once we'd nabbed you. (Piet laughs) You should have been taken straight to the London Zoo and incarcerated there with a sign, spectators may distinguish the true baboon by his blue behind. (all laughing) - Mein Gott, when you think 10 better Limey officers, I shoot right in the middle of the forehead at the Battle of Spion Kopje, and him I miss. I never forgive myself. - Now, now, Cecil, come now, come now, Piet. We must forget the War. Boer and Briton, each fought fairly and played the game till the better man won and then, then we shook hands. We're all brothers within the Empire united under the flag on which the sun never sets. Ship me somewhere east of Suez-- (all groaning) - Oh no, not again. - Ah, you're there already, Jimmy. Worst is best here, and East is West, and tomorrow is yesterday. What more do you want? - Tomorrow, yes. It's high time I got straightened out and got down to business again. I have this suit cleaned and pressed before I go up there to see this man, I don't want him to look like a tramp. - White folks always said I was white. Look at the Big Chief in them days, he knew I was white. Oh, I'd saved up enough money to open my gamblin' house, and folks in the know, they say, see the man at the top, you don't have no trouble. Get Harry Hope to write you a letter to the Chief. And Harry does, don't you, Harry? - Hmm? Oh, sure, Big Bill was a good friend of mine. I had plenty of friends high up in those days. Still could have if I wanted to go up and see 'em. Sure, I wrote you a letter, said you was white. What the hell of it? - There, you see, Captain. I went to see the Chief shakin' in my boots. There he was sittin' behind this big desk lookin' like a big freight train. He don't look up, he just, he just keep me waitin' and waitin', and after what seemed like 'bout an hour, he's says in a voice slow and quiet, like there wasn't no harm in him, "So, you want to open a gamblin' joint, do you, Joe?" But he don't give me no time to answer! He jump up, lookin' like two freight trains, and he pounds his fist like a ham on the desk, and he shouts, "You black bastard, Harry says, you white, "and you better be white, else there's a little iron room "up the river waitin' for you." (laughs) And then, he sits down and he says slow and quiet again, "All right, you can open, now get the hell outta here." So, I open and he finds out I'm white sure enough, 'cause I run wide open for years and I pay my sugar on the dot, and the cops and me, we stay friends. Ah, them old days. Is the night I come in here. Oh, this place, this place was a first-class hangout for sports in them days. Good whiskey, 15 cents, two for two bits. I throws a $50 bill down like it was trash paper and I says, "Drink it up, boys, I don't want no change." Ain't that right, Harry? - Yes, and bejeeb, if I see you throw 50 cents on the bar now, I'd know I had the delirium tremens. (all laughing) - Thank you, Harry, old chum, I will take a drink with you now that you mention it, since it's so near your birthday. - What's that? Can't hear ya. - No, I imagined you wouldn't. - I don't have to hear you. How much room rent do you owe me, tell me that? - I'm sorry, Harry, adding has always baffled me. Subtraction is my forte, what? (all laughing) - Oh, ho, oh! Think you're funny, eh? Pftt, Captain, bejeeb. Showing off your wounds. Huh, ah, put your clothes on, man, this ain't a Turkish bath. Lousy Limey army. Took 'em years to lick a gang of Dutch farmers. - Ha, ha, ha, ha, that's right, Harry. Give 'em hell. - No lip outta you, you Dutch spinach. - [Cecil] Ha, ha! - General, ha, ha. Salvation Army, you want to be general in. Bragging what a great shot you were, and you missed him and he missed you. And now the two of you bum on me. But you broke the camel's back this time, you'll pay up tomorrow or out you go. - My dear fellow, I give you my word of honor as an officer and a gentleman, you will be paid tomorrow. - That's right, Harry. Tomorrow without fail, he's serious. - There you are, Harry. Sure, what could be fairer than that? - Yeah, you can't risk more than that, Harry. You know, a promise is a promise, as I've often discovered. - And I mean the both of you too. An old grafting flatfoot and a circus bunco steerer. Fine company for me, bejeeb. A couple of con men living in my flat and you ain't even got the decency to take me upstairs where I got a good bed. Let me sleep in a chair like a bum. - Harry, Ed and I did our darnedest to get you up, didn't we, Ed? - Yeah, we did. But you said you couldn't bear the flat because it was one of those nights that memory brought poor dear old Bess back to you. - Aye, that's right, boys. I remember now. I could almost see her in every room just as she used to be, but it's 20 years. - Isn't a daydream of yesterday a touching thing? By all accounts, Bessie nagged the hell out of him. - 'Bout time I stopped loafing around, it's a wonder. Gotta get my shoes soled and heeled and shined first thing tomorrow morning. I don't want to look like a tramp, I-- - Tomorrow Movement is a sad and beautiful thing too. - Ah, poor old Bessie. You don't see her likes these days, sweeter woman never drew breath. - Dear old Bess. Yeah, a man couldn't want a better sister than she was to me. - 20 years, and I've never set foot outside this house since the day I buried her, I didn't have the heart. Once she'd gone, I didn't give a damn about anything. I lost all my ambition. Without her, nothing seemed worth the trouble. You remember, Ed, and you too, Mac, the boys was going to nominate me for alderman. Oh, I'd have been elected easy. - Oh, you would, Harry, it was a sure thing. - Yeah, it was a dead cinch, Harry, everybody knows that. - Sure they do, but when Bessie died, I didn't have the heart. Still, I know but while she'd appreciate my grief, she wouldn't want it to have me cooped up here all my life. So, I've made up my mind, I'll go out soon. Take a walk around the ward, see the friends I used to know, maybe get together with the boys, tell them I'll let them deal me a hand in their game again. (chuckles) Bejeeb, I'll do it. Tomorrow, my birthday, that'll be a good day to turn over a new leaf. 60, that ain't too old. - It's the prime of life, Harry. - You know, the wonderful thing about you, Harry, is that you keep young as you ever was. - I gotta get my stuff out of the laundry. They must still have them. I want to make a good appearance, you know. Oh, I met Dick Trumbull on the street a year or two ago. He said to me, Jimmy, the directories department hasn't been the same since you left, it's dead as hell. I said, I know, I know, Dick. I hear the management's at their wits' end, be only too glad to have me come back and run it for 'em again. I think all I need to do would be go up and see them and they'd give me the position, don't you think so, Dick? He said, sure, sure they would, Jimmy. Only take my advice and wait until business conditions are better. Well, conditions must be better by this time. All I need to do is get fixed up with a decent front, and it's as good as done. - I'm sorry we had to postpone our trip again this April, Piet. I had hoped the blasted estate would be settled up then. But anyway, we'll make it next year, old boy, even if we have to work and earn our passage money, all right? Oh, England in April. - Oh bejeeb, Jimmy's got them all smoking the same hop. - Oh, this bughouse will drive me stark, raving loony yet. - Oh, the old wise guy. Wise, hell. No good anarchist I-Won't-Worker, I'm sick of you and Hugo too. You'll pay up tomorrow or I'll start a Harry Hope Revolution. I'll tie a dispossess bomb to your tails that'll blow you to the street, tsk. I'll make your Movement move. (all laughing) - You know, Harry, you sure say the funniest things. Oh hell, where's my drink? Oh, that damn Rocky's too fast cleaning off tables. I only took one little sip. - No, no, you don't. Any time you take one sip of a drink, you'll have lockjaw and paralysis. - Sure, it's not like you to be so hard-hearted, Harry. - Yah, you, Mac, another crook. Who asked you to laugh? We was talking about poor old Bessie, and you and her no-good brother of hers started to laugh. A hell of a thing. You know her opinion of you, Mac. That Pat McGloin is the biggest drunken grafter that ever disgraced the police force, she used to say to me. I hope they send him to Sing Sing for life. - Ah, she didn't mean it. Bess had a heart of gold underneath all her sharpness. She knew I was innocent of all the charges. - One moment, please, Lieutenant McGloin. Are you aware you are under oath? You realize what the penalty for perjury is? Come now, Lieutenant, isn't it a fact that you're as guilty as hell? Now, don't say, "How about your old man?" I'm asking the questions. The fact that he was a crooked old bucket shop bastard has no bearing on your case. Gentlemen of the jury, court will now recess while the DA sings a little ditty he learned at Harvard. (all laughing) It was composed in a wanton moment by the Dean of the Divinity School on a moonlight night in July 1776 while sobering up in a Turkish bath. - [Cecil] Salut! ♪ Oh, come up, she cried, my sailor lad ♪ ♪ And you and I'll agree ♪ ♪ And I'll show you the prettiest ♪ (Willie tapping) ♪ That ever you did see. ♪ Harry, don't let Rocky bounce me upstairs. I'll go crazy alone. Listen, Mac, I apologize, don't get sore, I was only kidding you. - Sure, kid all you want to, Willie, I'm hardened to it. But I tell you that one of these days I am gonna get them to open up my case. Everybody knows there was no real evidence against me. I just took the blame for the ones higher up. - Of course, you'll be reinstated, Mac. All you need is a brilliant young attorney to handle your case. I'll be straightened out and on the wagon in a day or two. I've never practiced. You will let me handle your case, won't you, Mac? - Sure, I will, Willie, it'll make your reputation. - Uh, haven't I heard that vision a thousand times? I wish to hell Hickey would turn up. - Harry, poor Willie needs a drink bad, you know? I think if we all joined him it'd make him feel he was among friends, kinda cheer him up, huh? - Ha, ha, more circus tricks. Ha, bejeebs, Bessie had you sized up. - Ha, ha, ha, yeah, dear old Bess, ha, ha, ha, ha. Hey, remember the time she sent me down to the bar to change a $10 bill for her? - Ha, do I? She coulda taken a bite out of the stove lid, when she found it out. (all laughing) I was sure surprised when she asked me to change that 10 spot, you know, Bess usually had better sense, but ah, but she was in a hurry to get to church, you know? I really didn't mean to do it, but you know, the circus season was gonna begin soon, and I needed a little practice keepin' my hand in. I said to her, I said, "Bess, I'm sorry, "I had to take it all out in dimes. "Here, here, hold out your hands "and I'll count it out for you, "so you won't be kicking afterwards "that I short-changed you. "10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, a dollar. "10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, now you're counting with me, "aren't you, Bess? "80, 90, $2. "10, 20, hey those are pretty shoes you got on, Bess, "40, 50, 70, 80, 90, $3. "10, 20, 30, hey, that's a nice little hat you got on, Bess, "50, 70, 80, 90, $4. "10, 20, 30, 50, 70, 80, 90, "hey, that's a swell looking chapeau you got there. "Say, looks very becoming, $6." (all laughing) And so on. Ah well, I'm a bum at it now 'cause I'm out of practice, but you know, back in those days, I could have short-changed the Keeper of the Mint. - But a hell of a guy you are, bragging how you short-changed your own sister. - Oh gosh. - [Harry] You know. - Thinking on that old ticket wagon brings those days back again. Was the greatest life on earth, that was the greatest show on earth, and the grandest crowd of regular guys ever gathered under one tent. You know, I'd sure like to shake their hands again. - They'd have guns in theirs. (all laughing) They'd shoot you on sight. Why, you've touched every damned one of them. You've even borrowed fish from the trained seals and peanuts from every elephant that remembered you. (all chuckling) - Yeah, you know, Harry though, I've made up my mind, I mean, I'm gonna, I'm gonna see the boss in a couple of days and I'm gonna ask for my job back. (Harry chuckling) You know, well, there ain't no percentage in hanging around here now taking care of you, shooing away your snakes. I don't even get an eye-opener for my trouble, hmm? - No. You can go to hell or the circus, for all I care, and a damned good riddance. I wonder what the hell happened to Hickey? I hope he'll show up. Oh, he's always good for a million funny stories. You know, you and these other bums are beginning to give me the graveyard fantods. Oh, I'd sure could do a laugh with Hickey. Remember that gag he always pulls about his wife and the iceman? (all laughing) He'd make a cat laugh, that one would. - Opening time, Boss. Why don't you go to bed, Boss? Hickey'd never turn up this time of the mornin'. - There's somebody coming now. - Aw, that's only my two pigs. It's about time they showed up.4 (Margie and Pearl giggling) Nix, (speaking in foreign language), eh? - Oh, jeez, Pearl, this place is a morgue with all these stiffs on deck. Heya wise guy, you died yet? - Not yet, Margie, I'm waiting impatiently for the end. - Who's the new guy? Friend of yours? Hey kid, wanna have a good time? - He's passed out, the hell with him. - You dumb broads, will ya cut out the noise? - Sit down before I knock ya down. Well, how did you tramps do? - Pretty good, huh, Pearl? - Yeah, picked up a couple of all-night guys. - On Sixth Avenue, boobs from the sticks. - Stinko, the both of 'em. - We thought we's in luck, we steered them to a real hotel. We figured they too stinko to bother us much and we could cop a good sleep in beds that ain't got cobblestones in the mattress like the ones in this dump. - Yeah, but were outta luck though. They didn't bother us much that way, you know, but they won't go to sleep neither. Gee, I never heard such a couple of gabby guys. - They got onto politics, drinkin' out the bottle. They forget we's around. "Ah, the Bull Mooses is the only regular guys," one guy says. And the other one says, "I'm a Republican and you're a liar." And then they laugh. - Yeah, and then they make a bluff like they gonna scrap, and then they make up and then they cry and then they laugh, and then they sing "School Days." Imagine tryin' to sleep with that on the phonograph. - Maybe you think we wasn't glad when the house dick came and told us to take the air, huh? - Yeah, so we told the guys we'd meet 'em around the corner. - Yeah, so here we are. - Yeah, I see you, but I don't see no dough yet. - Hey, right on the job, ain't he, Margie? - Yeah, our little businessman, that's him. - Come on, dig. - Pipe him keepin' cases. - Scared we're holdin' out on him. - They way he grabs, you'd think it was him done the work. (Pearl and Margie laughing) All right, here you are, grafter. - We hope it chokes ya. - Hey, you dumb baby dolls give me a pain. - Well, jeez, what's the difference, huh? I didn't mean that, Rocky. - A lotta difference, get me? - Oh, don't get sore, can't ya take a little kiddin'? - Oh come on, Rocky, Pearl was only kiddin'. We know ya got a regular job. That's why we like ya, see? You don't live off of us, you're a bartender. - Yeah, sure I'm a bartender. - Anyway, we wouldn't keep no pimp, like we regular old whores, we ain't that bad. - Uh-uh, we're tarts, but that's all. - Yeah, Cora got back around three o'clock. She woked up Chuck and dragged him outta the hay to go to a chop suey joint. Imagine him standin' for that stuff. (chuckling) - I'll bet they been sittin' around kiddin' themselves with old pipe dream about gettin' married, settlin' down on the farm. Jeez, when Chuck's on the wagon, they never lay off that dope. - Chuck with a silly grin on his ugly mouth, and Cora gigglin' like she was in grammar school. - And her on the turf long before you and me ever was. - Yeah, of all the pipe dreams in this dump, they got the nuttiest. What would gettin' married get 'em? But that farm stuff is the sappiest part. When both of them was dragged up in this ward and ain't never been nearer a farm than Coney Island. They'd get DTs if they ever had a cricket chirp. (Margie and Pearl chuckling) Can you picture a good barkeep like Chuck diggin' spuds? And imagine a whore hustlin' the cows home. Ain't that a sweet picture? - Rocky, Cora may be a tart-- - Oh sure, that's all I meant, a tart. - Hey, hey, I betcha Cora don't know which end of the cow has got the horns on. (laughs) Hey, I'm gonna ask her. - Well, here's your chance, there's them two nuts now. - Oh, hello, hi. - Hi, hi, hi. - Jeez, the morgue on a rainy Sunday night. Hello, old wise guy. Ah! Ain't you croaked yet? - No, not yet, Cora, and it's damned tiring, this waiting for the end. - Oh, but go on, you'll never die. You'll have to hire somebody to croak ya with an axe. (Margie and Pearl laughing) - Hey, you dumb broad, would you cut out the noise? The hell you think it is, a cathouse? - Oh Harry, such language. - Oh, I bet Bessie's turning over in her grave. - If I had known this dump was a hooker hangout, I would have never have come here. - You seem to be down on the ladies. - I hate every one that ever lived, they're all alike. Well, you can understand how I feel, can't you, Larry? When it was getting mixed up with that tart that made me have that fight with Mother? - Hey, who's the guy with Larry? - A tightwad, the hell with him. - Say, Cora, wise me up on something, huh? Which end of the cow has got the horns on? (laughing) - Aw, don't remind me, I'm sick of hearin' about that farm. - You got nothin' on us. - Ah, me and this big tramp has been scrappin' about it. He says Jersey's the best place, I say Long Island because then we'll be near Coney. And I say to him, "How do I know "you're off of periodicals for life? "I don't give a damn how drunk ya get, the way we are, "but I don't want to be married to no soak." - And I tells her, "I'm off the stuff for life." - Yeah. - Then she beefs, we won't be married a month before I'll throw it in her face she was a tart. "Jeez baby," I tells her, "why should I? "What the hell ya think I think I'm marryin', a virgin? (Cora laughs) "Why should I beef "as long as ya lay off it "and don't do no cheatin' with the iceman or nobody? "That's on the level, baby." - Aw, go on, ya big tramp. - Can ya tie it up? I'll buy a drink, I'll do anything. - No, no, no, this round's on me. I run into luck. Yeah, that's why I dragged Chuck outta bed, to celebrate. It was a sailor, I got 12 bucks off him. Come on, Rocky, set 'em up. (all murmuring) Hey, where the hell is Hickey? - Well, that's what we're all wonderin'. - He should be here by now, me and Chuck seen him. - You seen Hickey? Hey, Boss, Boss, Boss, come to, come to, Cora's seen Hickey. - Hickey? Where'd you see him, Cora? - Right on the corner. He was just standin' there. We said to him, "Welcome to our city." "The gang's expecting you with their tongues "hangin' out a yard long." And he just said, "Tell the gang I'll be along in a minute." But you know, he was funny somehow. He was different or somethin'. - Sure, he was sober, baby. - Sure, gee, ain't I dumb? - Oh, the dumbest broad I've ever seen. (all chuckling) Sober? Now, that's funny. He always managed to lap up a good starter before he got here. Well, well, he won't be sober long. He'll be good and ripe for my birthday party tonight. You know fellas, I'll bet he thought up some new gag for us. Now, we must all pretend to let him kid us, then we'll kid the pants off him. (all laughing) Here's the old bastard himself! - Hello, gang! Hey, do your duty, Brother Rocky! Bring on the rat poison. (all laughing) ♪ Oh, it's always fair weather ♪ ♪ When good fellows get together ♪ ♪ And another little drink ♪ ♪ Will not do us any harm ♪ - [Hickey] Hey there, how are you? ♪ It's always fair weather ♪ ♪ When good fellows get together ♪ ♪ And another little drink ♪ ♪ Will not do us any harm ♪ - Oh, Hickey, Hickey, boy. Bastard! Great to see your ugly, grinning mouth again. Oh, you know, this dumb broad here said you'd changed, but you haven't, not a bit, you're the same old Hickey. You know, you look like a million dollars. - Here's your key, Hickey, the same old room. - Ah, thanks, Rocky. I think I'll go up in a little while and grab a snooze. Haven't been able to sleep lately, I'm tired as hell. Couple of hours good kip will fix me, won't it? - Well, it's the first time I ever heard you worry about sleep. Damn it man, you never would go to bed. (all laughing) Here, get a couple of slugs under your belt, and you'll forget all about sleep. Mud in your eye, Hickey. - Drink hearty, boys and girls. - Hey, hey, is that some new stunt, drinking the chaser first? - [Hickey] No, no, I forgot to tell Rocky. You'll have to excuse me, boys and girls, but I'm off the stuff for keeps. - Oh ho, what the hell do you mean? Ho, ho, joined the Salvation Army. Been elected President of the WCTU. (all laughing) Oh, Rocky, Rocky, take away bottle, we don't want to tempt the man into sin. (Rocky laughing) - Oh hell, governor. You don't think I'd come around here peddling some brand of temperance bunk, do you? You know me better than that. Just because I'm off the stuff doesn't mean I'm going Prohibition. Not that ungrateful. No, the only reason I've quit is, well, I finally had the guts to face myself and throw overboard the damned lying pipe dream that was making me miserable, and then all at once, I found I was at peace with myself, and I didn't need booze anymore. That's all there was to it. Oh, but what the hell. Don't let me be a wet blanket making fool speeches about myself. (laughs) - [All] Whoa! - Set 'em up again, Rocky. Keep the balls coming till that's killed, then ask for more. - Jeez, a roll that'd choke a hippopotamus. - Oh, you know that water wagon bull! Hey, cut out the act and have a drink, for Pete's sake. - [All] Yeah! - It's no act, governor, no act. You know, you've all been good pals to me, best friends I ever had. I've been thinking about you all the time I was walking over here. - [Harry] Walking? Do you mean to say you walked? - I sure did, all the way from the wilds of darkest Astoria. (all chuckling) Didn't make such bad time either. See, it was going on 12 when I went in the bedroom to tell Evelyn I was leaving. Six hours, say. No, less than that. Well anyway, I was standing on the corner quite a while thinking about how to save you. (all chuckling) No, no, I didn't mean booze. I meant saving ya from pipe dreams. Yeah, you gotta stop lying about yourself and kidding yourself about tomorrow, hmm? *(chuckles) Oh, but what the hell? This is beginning to sound like some damned sermon on the way to lead the good life. (all laughing) You'll have to forget that part of it, it's in my blood, I guess. My old man used to wail salvation into my heinie with a birch rod. He was a preacher from the sticks of Indiana, like I told you. Well now, look boys and girls, don't look at me as if I'm selling you some kinda goldbrick. I got nothing up my sleeves, honest. Come on, let's take an example, hmm? Any one of you. Ah, let's take you, governor. That walk around the ward you never take. - Well, what about it? - [Hickey] Why, you know as well as I do, Harry, everything about it. - Gee, I'm going to take it. - Sure, you're gonna take it, this time, and I'm going to help you. Because I know it's the one thing you've got to do before you'll ever know what real peace means. And the same thing with you, Jimmy. You gotta to try and get your old job back, and no tomorrow about it. Now, now, don't tell me, Jimmy, I know all about tomorrow, I wrote the book. - I don't understand you. I admit I've foolishly delayed, but as it so happens, I just made my mind that as soon as I could get straightened out-- - Fine, that's the spirit. You know, you've been damned kind to me, Jimmy, and I want to show you how grateful I am. And when it's all over and you don't have to nag at yourself anymore, well you're gonna be grateful to me too. And all the rest of ya, ladies included, are in the same boat, one way or another. (Larry laughs) - Well damn, Hickey, you know you've hit the nail on the head. This dump is the Palace of Pipe Dreams. - Aww, the old grandstand fool-osopher speaks. (all chuckling) You think you're the one big exception, huh Larry? Life doesn't mean a damn to you anymore. You've retired from the circus, waiting impatiently for the end, the good old long sleep. Well, I think a lot of you, Larry, you old bastard. I'll try and make an honest man of you too. - What the devil are you hinting at, Hickey? - Well, you don't have to ask me, do you? A wise old guy like you? Just ask yourself, I'll bet you know. - Oh, he's got your number all right, Larry. That's the stuff, Hickey, show the old faker up! He can't sneak out of everything. - Hello. A stranger in our midst. I don't think I noticed you before, brother. - My name's Parritt. I'm an old friend of Larry's. Well, what are you staring at? - Oh, no offense, brother, no offense. I'm just trying to figure, haven't we met before some place? - No, this is my first time East. - No, you're right, you're right. But still I recognized something about you. We're members of the same lodge in some way. - You're nuts, what are you talking about? - Mind your own business, Hickey. He's nothing to you or to me. - So? - Oh, you're holding us in suspense. Tell us more about how you're going to save us. (all murmuring) - Yeah, you tell us. - Well hell, Larry, don't get sore, not at me. I know I've always liked you a hell of a lot. - Well, I always liked you too. Forget it, Hickey. - Fine, that's the spirit. (laughing) Well, what's the matter, everybody? What is this, a funeral? Come on, drink up! A little action. - Hey watch! (Hickey chuckling) - God, I'm sleepy all of a sudden. That long walk must be gettin' me. I better go upstairs. Yeah, heck of a thing to go dead on you like this. No sir, boys and girls, I never knew what real peace was until now. Oh, it's a grand feeling, it's like when you're sick and suffering like hell and the Doc comes and he gives you a shot in the arm, and the pain goes, and you drift off. Let go of yourself at last. Let yourself sink down to the bottom of the sea. Rest in peace. No farther you have to go. Not a single damned hope or dream left to torment you. Oh, you'll all know what I mean, when you... Mm, excuse me boys and girls, I'm all in, got to grab 40 winks. Drink up, everybody, on me. - Bejeeb, that's a hell of a stunt, go to sleep on us. I can't figure Hickey, I'd still say he's kidding us. What do you think, Jimmy? - Uh, he does appear changed. But he'll probably be himself tomorrow, I mean, as soon as he wakes up. - You'll make a mistake if you think he's only kidding. - I don't like that guy, Larry. I'm going to steer clear of him. - Still, Harry, there was some sense to his nonsense. It is true I should get my job back, though I hardly need him to remind me. - Yeah, yeah, I ought to take that walk, only I don't need no Hickey to help me, seeing I got it all fixed for my birthday tomorrow. - Aha, heh, heh, well he's made two sales of his peace at least. But you better make sure that it's the real McCoy and not poison. - You bughouse I-Won't-Work harp, who asked you to shove your oar in? What the hell do you mean, poison? Just because he got your number? Gee, I don't get it, he ain't like the old Hickey. Ah, he'll be a hell of a wet blanket at my birthday party tonight. Wish to hell he'd never shown up. - Ah, give him time, Harry, he'll come out of it. You know, I've watched many a case of almost fatal teetotalism, but they all came out of it, you know, completely cured and as drunk as ever. (all laughing) You know, in my opinion, the poor sap is temporarily bughouse from overwork. You can't be too careful about work. It's one of the deadliest habits known to science, a great physician once told me. Yeah, he used to practice on street corners under a torchlight. He was positively the only doctor in the world that claimed that rattlesnake oil, rubbed on the prat, could cure heart failure. (all laughing) In three days. Yeah, I remember saying to me, "Oh," he says, "you're naturally delicate, Ed, but if you drink "a pint of bad whiskey every morning before breakfast "and never work if you can help it, "why you may live to a ripe old age. (all laughing) "It's staying sober and working "that cuts men off in their prime." (all laughing) - You laugh, little bourgeois monkey faces. Laugh like fools, little stupid people. I will laugh too. I will laugh last. I will laugh at you. The days grow hot, O Babylon. - [All] 'Tis cool beneath thy willow trees. - So, tell me more about your doctor friend, Ed. He strikes me as the only bloody sensible medical I ever heard of. I think we outta appoint him house physician here without a moment's delay. - [All] Yeah! - That's the spirit, everybody. Don't let me be a wet blanket. All I want is to see you happy. - Huh, thanks, Larry. How's that, kid? - Now, what the hell do I know about flowers? - Well, you can see they're pretty, can't ya, you big dummy? - Yeah, baby, sure, if you like 'em, they're okay with me. - Aw, geez, Pearl, that's some cake, huh? - Yeah. - Yeah, look it, six candles, each for 10 years. - When do we light the candles, Rocky? - Ask that bughouse Hickey. He's elected himself boss of this birthday racket. "Just before Harry comes down," he says. Jeez, ever since Kickey woke up, ya can't hold him. He's taken on the party like it was his birthday. - Well, he's payin' for everything, ain't he? - Aw, I wish the louse never showed up. I hope he don't come back from that delicatessen. He's getting everyone nuts. He's got Harry and Jimmy Tomorrow run ragged, and the rest are hidin' in their rooms so they won't have to listen to him. And they're gettin' kinda cagey with the booze too, like they was scared if they get too drunk, they might spill their guts or somethin'. And everybody's getting a prize grouch on. - Yeah, you'd think he suspected me and Chuck hadn't no real intention of gettin' married. - Yeah, we're goin' show him, baby, huh? - Well, we've decided, Jersey's where we want the farm, and we're gonna get married there too 'cause you don't need no license there. And we're gonna get married tomorrow, ain't we, honey? - You bet, baby. - Aw, jeez Chuck, are ya lettin' that bughouse louse Hickey kid ya into-- - He ain't kiddin' him into nothin', and me neither. And besides, Hickey's right, if this old big tramp is goin' to marry me, he ought to do something about it, not just shoot off his old bazoo about it. - Aw, you can't be that dumb, Chuck. - You keep outta this, you and your crickets, you'd think they was elephants. - Aw, don't listen to that broad, Rocky. Heard what she said, tomorrow, it's the same old crap. - [Cora] Is that so? - Jeez, imagine Cora a bride. Ain't that a hot one? Hey Cora, if all the guys you ever stayed with was put side by side, you could walk on 'em from here to Texas. (Margie, Pearl, and Rocky laughing) - Oh, you can't talk to me like that, you fat dago hooker. I may be a tart, but I ain't a cheap old whore like you. - I'll show you who's a whore! (women and Rocky yelling) Well, who wants to? But nobody can't call me no whore! - Aw, bury it. What are you, a virgin? - [Cora] Ha! - I suppose you think I'm a whore too, is that it? - Yeah, and me? - Now. don't start nothin'. - I suppose it'd tickle you if Margie and me were to do what that louse, Hickey, hintin' at and come right out and admit that we was whores. - All right, what of it? It's the truth, ain't it? - All right, all right, all right, Rocky. All right, we're whores. You know what that makes you, don't you? - Look out, now, huh? - A lousy little pimp, that's what. - I'll learn you! - Ow! - A dirty little Guinea pimp, that's what! - That's it! I'll learn you! - [Margie] He's provin' it to us, Pearl! - Yeah, Hickey converted him all right! - Oh! - You lay off of me or I'll beat the hell outta you! (Larry laughing) Who the hell you laughin' at, you half-dead old stewed bum? - At himself, he ought to be. Jeez, Hickey sure got his number. - Heh, come on wake up, Comrade Hugo! (laughing) Here's the Revolution starting on all sides of us and you're sleeping through it! Come, ha, ha! Yeah, to Hickey the great nihilist! He's started a movement that'll blow up the world. (laughs) - You, Larry, renegade, traitor. Damn you, think I'll have you shot. - Ha, ha, okay. (Hugo groans) - That bourgeois swine, Hickey. He thinks I am finish, it is too late, and so I do not wish the day to come because it will not be my day. Oh, I see what he thinks. I will have him hanged, the first one of all, to the first lamppost! (Hugo laughing) Why you so serious, you little monkey faces? It's all a big joke, no? So, we get drunk, and then we laugh like hell, then we die, and the pipe dream vanish. The days grow hot, O Babylon! So, be of good cheer, little stupid peoples! Gott, that rotten damn Hickey. It's he who makes me sneer. I want to sleep. - Gee, Hickey ain't missin' no bets, is he? He's even give Hugo the works. - I warned you this morning that he wasn't kidding. - I never seen a guy change so much. Larry, you always pretend to be such a wise old fox about everything. What do ya think has happened to him? - Aw, I don't know, with all his gab, he's kept that to himself so far, I noticed. Hell, maybe he's saving the great revelation for Harry's party. Oh, to hell with him, I don't give damn what it is, let him mind his own business and I'll mind mine. - I don't give a damn what happened to Hickey, but I know what's gonna happen if he don't watch his step. I told him, I'll take a lot from you, Hickey, like everyone else in this dump, because you always been a grand guy, but there's things I don't take from you nor nobody, remember, see? Or you'll wake up in a hospital, or maybe worse, with your wife and the iceman walkin' slow behind ya. - Ooh, ya shouldn't have made that iceman crack, Rocky. It's all right for him to kid about it but you, hey, I notice he ain't pulled that iceman gag this time. Hey, do you suppose he really did catch his wife cheatin'? I don't mean with no iceman, but with some guy? - Aw, that's the bunk. He'd have beat her up and gone on the worst drunk he ever staged, like any other guy'd do. - Sure, Rocky's got the right dope, baby, he'd be paralyzed. - Yeah, I's stood tellin' people this dump is closed for the night, all I'm gonna. Let Harry hire a doorman and pay him wages if he wants one. - Yeah? Harry's pretty damned good to you. - Sure, he is, I don't mean that. Anyways, it's all right. I told Schwartz, the cop, that we's closed for the party, and he'll keep folks away. I want me a big drink, that's what. - [Chuck] Ya can have all ya want on Hickey. - Yeah, I drink on him, but I don't drink with him, no sir. No, sir, never no more. - What's he done to you? - Sure, you think he's all right with you. He's a white man, ain't he? Now, you listen to me, you white boys. Don't you get it in your heads that I'm pretendin' to be what I ain't or that I ain't proud to be what I am? Or else you and me gonna have trouble. - What a nerve, we act nice to the guy, and he gets a swelled nut. If that ain't a coon all over. - Talkin' fight talk, huh? I'll murder the nigger. - Listen, boys, I's sorry. I didn't mean that. You been good friends to me. I'm nuts, I guess. That Hickey, he get my head all mixed up with craziness. - Aw, that's aw right, Joe. The boys wasn't takin' ya serious. Oh boy, what'd I say, Hickey ain't missin' no bets. Even Joe. But ya know, you can't help likin' the louse. I mean, ya gotta admit he's got the right dope on, on some of the bums here. - He's certainly got one guy I know figured out, ain't he, Pearl? - He certainly has. - Cut it out, I told ya. - Well, well, well! Here I am in the nick of time. Come on, give me a hand with these bundles, somebody. - [Pearl] Jeez, Hickey, ya almost scared me outta my skin, sneakin' in like that. - Sneaking? Why, me and the taxi man made enough noise getting my big surprise in the hall to wake the dead. - [Chuck] Hey, is those bundles grub, Hickey? You bought enough here to feed an army - It can't be too much. I want this to be the biggest birthday party Harry's ever had. Hey Chuck, you and Rocky go out in the hall and get the big surprise. My arms is busted lugging it. - Jeez, ya got us all het up, Hickey. What is it, huh? - Ah, you just wait and see. I got it as a treat for the three of you more than anyone. I said to myself, I bet this is what'll please those whores more than anything. What's the matter? You look sore. What? Aw, I see, but you know how I feel about that. - Okay, Hickey, let it slide. - Look, here it comes. (laughs) Unveil it, boys. - (gasps) Oh, it's champagne. Oh jeez, Hickey, if you ain't a sport. - I never been soused on champagne. Pearl, let's get stinko. - You betcha, the both of us. - Oh Hickey, you sure hittin' the high spots. When I runs my gamblin' house, I drink that old bubbly water in steins, and I'm gonna drink it that way again too, soon as I get my stake. - What'll we drink it out of, Hickey? - Well, Joe has the right idea, schooners. That's the spirit for Harry's birthday. (Hugo laughing) - We will drink vine beneath the willow trees. - That's the spirit, Brother, and let the lousy slaves drink vinegar, hmm? (chuckles) - You rotten damned liar. - Leave Hugo be. He rotted 10 years in prison for his faith. He's earned his dream. Have you no decency or pity? - Hello, what's this? I thought you were in the grandstand. Now listen, Larry, you're getting me all wrong. Of course, I have pity but it isn't my old kind of pity, the kind yours is, kind that lets itself off easy by encouraging some poor guy to go on kidding himself with a lie, the kind that leaves the poor slob worse off because it makes him feel guiltier than ever. Hell, I know all about that kind of pity. I've had a bellyful of it in my time, and it's all wrong. And you're be grateful to me too, Larry, when you can admit all at once without being ashamed, that all the grandstand philosopher stuff and the waiting for the Big Sleep is just a pipe dream. You'll say to yourself, I'm an old man who's scared of life but even more scared of dying. So, I'm sittin' here and gettin' drunk and hangin' onto life at any price, and then you'll know what real peace means, Larry, because then you won't be scared of either life or death anymore. You simply won't give a damn. Any more than I do, huh? - Damn if I'm not beginning to think you've gone mad. You're a liar! - Well, hell, Larry, that's no way to talk to an old pal who's trying to help you. If you really wanted to die, you'd just take a hop off your fire escape, wouldn't you? And if you really were in the grandstand, you wouldn't go around pitying everyone. Oh, I know, I know, the truth is tough to take at first. It was for me too. And as for my being bughouse, you can't crawl out of it that way. Hell, I'm too damned sane. I can size up guys and turn 'em inside out better than I ever could. Especially when they're strangers like that Parritt kid. He's licked, Larry. I think there is only one possible way out you can help him to take. That is, if you have the right kind of pity for him. - I'm not advising him, except to leave me out of his troubles. He's nothing to me. - Ah, but you'll find he won't agree to that. He'll keep after you until he makes you help him because he's got to be punished, so he can forgive himself. Look Larry, he can't manage it alone, and you are the only one he can turn to. - For the love of God, will you mind your own business. What do you know about him anyway? He's hardly spoken to you. - No, no, you're right, but I do know a lot about him just the same. I've had hell inside of me, and I can spot it in others. Maybe that's what gives me the feeling there's something familiar about him, something between us. It's a woman, I know the symptoms. (Larry laughing) - And you're the boy who's never wrong. Oh, you damned fool. (laughs) His trouble is that he was brought up to revere the Movement, that's all, and he's lost his faith. It's a shock, but he's young, and he'll find another dream just as good, or as bad. - (laughs) All right, Larry. I'll let it go at that. But I'm glad he's here because he'll help me make you wake up to yourself. Oh, I've always liked you a lot, you old bastard. (chuckles) Well, well, well, not much time before 12. Come on, let's get busy, boys and girls. Oh, the cake all set. (laughs) And my presents, and yours, girls, and Chuck's and Rocky's. Aw, that's fine, Harry'll certainly be touched by your thought of him. Hey listen, I'll go up now and root everyone out. Pearl, you light the candles on the cake when you hear us coming, and Cora, get ready to play Harry's favorite song. Come on, hustle, everybody. We want this to come off in style. - Jeez, I gotta practice. I ain't touched a box in I don't know how long. (light piano music) How does that tune go, Joe? I ain't played that to him. ♪ Always ♪ ♪ Jolly ♪ (Larry laughing) - And now, it's a second feast of Belshazzar, with Hickey to do the writing on the wall. - Aw, shut up, Old Cemetery. Always beefin'. Well, if it ain't Prince Willie. Hey kid, you look terrible, grab yourself a shot. - No, thanks, not now. I'm tapering off. - What do ya know? He means it. - It was hell up in that damned room, Larry. The things I imagined, I thought I'd go crazy, but I got it beat now. By tomorrow morning, I'll be on the wagon. I'm gonna get back my clothes first thing. Hickey's loaning me the money. I'll do what I always said, go to the DA's office. He was a good friend of my old man's. He knows that I really was a brilliant law student. Oh, I know I can make good now that I'm off the booze forever. I owe a lot to Hickey. He's made me wake up to myself. It's not what he says. It's what's behind it, it's what he hints. You'd think all I wanted to do with my life was stay here and stay drunk. I'll show him. - If you want my advice, you'll put the nearest bottle to your mouth until you don't give a damn about Hickey. - Well, that's fine advice. I thought you were my friend! (Willie sobbing) (gentle piano music) (Cora humming) - Take it from the beginning. ♪ Every ♪ ♪ Sunday ♪ - Sunday. - Hey. ♪ Down to her home we go ♪ - That damned fool, Hickey. He just came knocking at my door. I opened it up because I thought it was probably you, and he came busting in and makes me come downstairs. I don't know what for. I don't belong in this birthday celebration. All I came here for was to find you. - I warned you. - Can't you make Hickey mind his own business? I don't like that guy, Larry. Gee, the way he acts, you'd think he had something on me. Why, just right now, he pats me on the shoulder and he says, "I know how it is, son, "but you can't hide from yourself, "not even here on the bottom of the sea." What did he mean by that, Larry? - How the hell would I know? - And then he grins and says, "Never mind, Larry's getting wise to himself. "I think you can rely on his help in the end." He says, "He'll have to choose between living and dying, "and he'll never choose to die "as long as there's a breath left in him." And then he grinned like it was a big joke on you. Well, what do you say to that, Larry? - I've nothing to say except you're a bigger damn fool to listen to him than he is to talk. - I see, he's no fool where you're concerned. He's got your number, all right. Oh, oh, I don't mean that. You know what I want most is to be friends with you, Larry. I haven't a single friend left in the world. I hoped that you... And you could be too, without it hurting you. You ought to, for Mother's sake. She really loved you, Larry And you loved her too, didn't you? - Leave what's dead in its grave. - Do you know, Larry, that you're the one of them all that she cared most about? She'd kid herself that you'd give up booze and come back to the Movement tomorrow. She'd say, "Larry can't kill in himself a faith "he's given his life to, not without killing himself." How about it, Larry? Was she right? I suppose what she really meant was to come back to her. She was always getting herself mixed up with the Movement. But I'm sure she really must have loved you, Larry. But she wasn't faithful to you at that, was she? That's why you walked out on her, isn't it? I remember that last fight you had. I remember that you got mad and you said, "I don't like living with a whore, if that's what you mean." - Lie, I never called her that. - I think that's why she still respects you, see, because it was you who walked out on her. You were the one to beat her to it. Well, she got sick of the others way before they ever did of her. I don't think she ever cared much about them. She just had to keep on having lovers to prove how free she was. It made home a lousy place. I got to feeling like you did about it. It was like living in a whorehouse, only worse because she didn't have to make her living-- - You bastard, she's your mother. Have you no shame? - Please don't go, Larry, I've got to talk to you or I'll talk to Hickey. He won't leave me alone. I feel he knows, anyway. But I hate his guts. I'm scared of him. There's just something not human behind that damned grinning and kidding. - You feel that too? - But I can't go on like this, Larry. I've got to tell you. - [Larry] I won't listen. - All right, I won't. Please, don't go. ♪ Every ♪ - Who the hell do you think you're kidding? I know damned well you've guessed. - I've guessed nothing. - But I want you to guess. I know now, since Hickey's been after me, that I meant you to guess right from the very start. That's why I came to you. I want you to understand the reason, Larry. See, I began studying American history, and I got admiring guys like Washington and Jefferson and Lincoln and Jackson. And I began to feel patriotic and really, really love this country. - You stinking rotten liar. Do you think you can fool me with such hypocrite's cant. I don't give a damn what it is that you did. It's on your head whatever it was. I don't know what it was and I won't know. - I just didn't think they would catch her. Please believe that. You know I never would have done such a thing. - All I know is that I'm sick of life. I'm through. I've forgotten myself. I'm drowned and contented on the bottom of a bottle. Honor or dishonor, faith, treachery are nothing to me but the opposites of the same stupidity. In the end, they rot and die in the same grave, so go away. You're wasting your breath. I've forgotten your mother. (Don chuckling) - The old philosopher. Why, you lousy old faker. Wait till Hickey gets through with you. - Oh, hi there, tightwad Kid. You come to join the party? Ain't he bashful, Pearl? - Yeah, especially with his dough. - [Piet] How dare you? - [Cecil] You're that no-good-- - Hey Rocky, fight in the hall. - [Cecil] Get down there, you-- - [Piet] No! (Cecil and Piet yelling) - Can ya beat it? I've heard you two call each other every name you could think of, but I never, a swell time to stage your first bout on Harry's birthday party. What started the scrap? Nothing, just nothing This is our business after all. That blasted ass Hickey, he made some insinuation about me, and the boorish Boer had the impertinence to agree with him. - That's a lie. Hickey made joke about me, and that Limey said it was true. - Well, sit down, the bot' of ya, cut out this rough stuff. Harry's party begins in a minute, and we don't want no soreheads around. - Very well. In deference to the occasion, I apologize, General Wetjoen, provided that you do also. Aye, Captain Lewis, in that case, I also apologize because Harry is my good friend. - Oh, what the hell, if you can't do better than that! - Oh, here come the two star boarders. I'm tell you, Ed, this time it's serious. That bastard, Hickey, has got Harry on the hip, and it won't do us no good if he gets him to take that walk tomorrow. - Ah, you're damn right. You know, Harry'll mosey down around the ward dropping in on everybody he knew when, you know? Heh, they'll all give him a phony glad hand and tons of good advice on what a sucker he is to put up with us. - He's sure to call on Bessie's relations to do a little crying over poor dear Bessie. And you know what that bitch and her family thought of me. - Now remember, Lieutenant, you are speaking of my sister. Dear Bessie wasn't a bitch. She was the queen bitch of them all. But if you think my loving relatives are gonna have time to discuss you, you don't know 'em. They're gonna be too busy telling Harry what a drunken crook I am and hoe he oughta have me put up in Sing Sing or something. - Once Bessie's relations get their hooks in, it'll be as tough for us as if she wasn't gone. - Yeah, Harry's getting old. He'll be an easy mark for those grafters. Oh, hell, Mac, we're saps to worry. Harry's been pull that bluff about taking a walk every birthday he's had for 20 years. - Yeah, but Hickey wasn't siccing him on those times. Just the opposite. - Ah well, I don't care whether he goes or not. I'm gettin' outta here tomorrow anyway. I'm just sorry for you, Mac. - Oh, you needn't be. Ain't I leaving myself? I was just feeling sorry for you. - Yes, my mind is made up. I feel the call of the old carefree circus life again, boy, right in my blood. I'm gonna see the boss tomorrow. You know, it's late in the season, but he'll be glad to put me on. Boy, won't all the old gang be tickled to death when they see me walk right on the lot, huh? - Maybe, if they've got a rope handy. - Now listen, Mac, I'm gettin' sick of ya kidding. - You are, are you? Well, I'm sick of you kidding me about getting reinstated. I'm tapering off, and in the morning, I'll be fresh as a daisy. I'm going to go and have a private chin with the commissioner. A man alive, from what the boys tell me, there's sugar galore these days, and I'll soon be riding around in a big red automobile with loads of cash. (Ed laughing) - Hey, hey, One Lung Hop. Put some fresh peanut oil in the lamp and cook the lieutenant another dozen pills. It's his gowed-up night, huh? - Listen, one more crack outta you, and I'll bash ya, ya big fat scum. - You will, huh? (Ed and Pat yelling) - Are you guys nuts? Jeez, it's Harry's birthday party. Sit down and behave. - All right, you just tell him to lay off. - You tell him to lay off me. - Everything all set? Fine. Harry's starting down with Jimmy. You know, I had a hell of a time gettin' 'em to move. They'd rather stay hiding up there kidding each other along. (Hickey laughing) Harry doesn't even want to remember it's his birthday now. Oh, here they come. Pearl, light the candles. Get ready to play, Cora. Chuck and Rocky, bring the wine, huh? Come on, stand up, everybody! Oh hum, the dot, it's 12.

She was always singing it. Aw gee, it brings it all back, I wish-- - Yes, we've all heard you tell us you thought the world of her, Governor. - Well, so I did. Everyone knows I did. Bejeeb, if you say I didn't-- - Now, Governor, I didn't say anything. You're the only one knows the truth about that. - Marjorie's favorite song was "Loch Lomond." She sang beautifully, she was beautiful. She played the piano beautifully. She had a beautiful voice. You were lucky, Harry. Bessie died. But there are more bitter sorrows than losing the woman one loves by the hand of death. - Oh now, Jimmy, you needn't go on. Why, we all know the story of how you came back to Cape Town and found her in the hay with a staff officer. We know you like to that that's what started you on the booze and ruined your life. - I was talking to Harry. Will you kindly keep out. My life is not ruined. - But I'll bet if you admit the truth to yourself, you'll confess you were pretty sick of her hating you for getting drunk. I bet you were really damned relieved when she gave you such a good excuse. I know, Jimmy. - Ah! (Larry laughs) So, that's what happened to you, is it, Hickey? Your old iceman joke came home to roost, did it? Well, you should have remembered the truth of the old superstition that you better watch out what you call because in the end, it'll come to you. - Oh, is that a fact, Larry? Then you'd better look out how you keep calling for that old Big Sleep, huh? (laughs) But what are we waiting for, boys and girls? Let's get the party rolling.

All I can say is thanks, thanks again to everyone for a remembering me on my birthday. Only don't think because I'm 60, I'll be a bigger damned fool and easier mark than ever. No, bejeeb. It's like Hickey says, this is the start of a new day. This dump's got to be run like other dumps, so's I can make some money and not just break even. People have got to pay what they owe me. I'm not running an orphan asylum for crooks and bums. Nor a damned hooker shanty either. Nor an old men's home for lousy Anarchist tramps that ought to be in jail. I'm sick of being played for a sucker. Don't think you're kidding me right now either. Oh, I know, you're giving me the laugh behind my back and thinking to yourselves, the old, lying, pipe-dreaming faker, we've heard his bull about taking a walk around the ward for years, he'll never make it. He's yellow, he ain't got the guts. He's afraid he'll find out. But I'll show you, bejeeb. And I'll show you too, you lousy son of a frying-pan-peddling bastard. - That's the stuff, Harry. That's exactly what I want you to do. - Oh listen, all of you, bejeeb, I am sorry. I lost my temper. I'm not feeling well. I've got a hell of a grouch on. Oh, you know, you're all as welcome as the flowers in May. - Aw, sure, Boss, you're always aces with us, see? Aw, listen everybody. I guess this is the spot where I owe it to you to do a little explaining and apologize for some of the rough stuff I've had to pull on you, but it simply had to be done. You must believe that. You know old Hickey. He was never one to start trouble. But I had to this time for your own good. I had to make you help me with each other. See, I saw what I had to do I couldn't alone, not in the time at my disposal. I knew when I came here, I wouldn't be able to stay with you long. I'm scheduled to leave on a long trip. But here's the point to get. I would never have acted the way I have if I wasn't sure it would be worth it to you in the end, when you're rid of the damned guilt that makes you lie to yourselves you're something you're not, and the remorse that nags at you and makes you hide behind lousy pipe dreams about tomorrow. You'll be in a today where there is no yesterday or tomorrow to worry about. You won't give a damn what you are any more. And I wouldn't say this unless I knew, brothers and sisters, this peace is real, it is a fact. I know 'cause I got it, here right in front of ya right now. Well, I guess that'll be about all from me for the present, boys and girls, so come, let's get on with the party. - Wait. I think it would help us poor pipe-dreaming sinners along the sawdust trail to salvation if you told us now what it was happened that converted you to this great peace of yours. - [Willie] Yeah, yeah. - [Piet] Yeah. - You didn't it when I asked you about the iceman, I noticed. Did this great revelation of the evil habit of dreaming about tomorrow come to you when you found out your wife was sick of you? - Bejeeb, you've hit it, Larry. I've noticed he hasn't shown his picture around this time. - He hasn't got it. The iceman took it away from him. - Yeah, just look at him, who would blame her? - She must've be hard up to fall for the iceman. - Imagine a sap like him advisin' Chuck and me to get married. - Yeah, he done so good with it. (all laughing) - At least I can say Marjorie chose an officer and a gentleman. - Come to look at you, Hickey, old chap, you've sprouted horns like a bloody antelope. - Pigger, by God, like a water buffalo's. (all laughing) ♪ Come up, she cried, my iceman lad ♪ ♪ And you and I'll agree ♪ ♪ And I'll show you the prettiest ♪ (all tapping) ♪ That ever you did see ♪ (all laughing) - Oh, well, I'm glad to see you're all getting in such good spirits for Harry's birthday party, even if the joke is on me. I admit I asked for it in the old days by always pulling that iceman gag. (laughing) So, go ahead, and laugh all you like. Well, this forces my hand, I guess, your bringing up the subject of Evelyn. I didn't want to tell you yet. It's hardly an appropriate time. I wanted to wait till the party was over, but you're getting the wrong idea about Evelyn, and I've gotta put a stop to that. I'm sorry to tell you, my dearly beloved wife is dead. - I felt he brought the touch of death on him. Forgive me, Hickey. I'd like to cut out my dirty tongue. - Sorry, Hickey. - I'm sorry. (all murmuring) - Sorry. - I didn't mean. - Oh now, listen, everybody. Don't let this be a wet blanket. You're still getting me all wrong. There's no reason... You see, I don't feel any grief. No, I've got to be glad for her sake because now, she's at peace. She's rid of me at last. Hell, I don't have to tell you, you all know what I was like. You can imagine what she went through, married to a no-good cheater and drunk like I was. But now she's at peace where she always longed to be. So, why should I feel sad? She wouldn't want me to feel sad. Why, all that Evelyn ever wanted out of life was to make me happy. - Eh, if I ain't a sap to let Chuck kid me into workin' his time so he could take the mornin' off. But I got sick and tired of arguin' with him. I says, "Aw right, get married, what's it to me?" Now, Hickey's got the both of them bugs. Some party last night, huh? Jeez, what a funeral. It was jinxed from the start, but his tellin' about his wife croakin' put the KO on it. - Yeah, it turned out it wasn't a birthday feast but a wake. - And all the gang sneakin' upstairs, leaving free booze and eats like they was poison. It didn't do them no good if they thought they'd shake him. He's been hoppin' from room to room all night. You can't stop him. He's got his Reform Wave going strong this mornin'. Did you notice him drag Jimmy out the first thing to get his laundry and his clothes pressed so he wouldn't have an excuse? And all the rest have been brushin' and shavin' themselves with the shakes. - Eh, he didn't come to my room. He's afraid I might ask him a few questions. - Yeah? Don't look to me he was scared of ya. I'd say you was scared of him. - You'd lie, then. - Don't let him kid you, Rocky. He kept his door locked. I couldn't get in either. - Yeah, who do ya think you're kiddin', Larry? He's showed you up, aw right. Like he says, if ya was so anxious to croak, why didn't ya hop off your fire escape long ago? - Because it'd be a coward's quitting, that's why. - He's all quitter, Rocky. - You lying punk. Remember what I warned you-- - Where'd you get a license to butt in? Shall I give him the bum's rush, Larry? If you don't want him around, nobody else don't. - Ah, let him stay. I don't mind him. He's nothing to me. - You're right, I have nowhere else to go now. You're the only one I have left to turn to. - You're a soft old sap, Larry. He's a no-good louse like Hickey. He don't belong. (Rocky groans) I'm all in. Not a wink of sleep. I can't keep my peepers open. - I'm sorry for riding you, Larry. But you get my goat when you act as if you don't give a damn what happened to me and keep your door locked so I can't even talk to you. But that was to keep Hickey out, wasn't it? I don't blame you. I'm getting to hate him. I'm getting more and more scared of him. Especially since he told us his wife was dead. It's that queer feeling he gives me that I'm mixed up with him some way. I don't know why, but it started me thinking about Mother, as if she were dead. I suppose she might as well be. Inside herself, I mean. It must kill her when she thinks about me. After all, I'm her only kid. Do you know, Larry, I once had the sneaking suspicion that if the truth were really known, you were my father. - Hey, you damned fool. Who put that insane idea in your head? You know it's a lie. Why, anyone in the Coast crowd could tell you that I never laid eyes on your mother until after you were born. - Well, I'd hardly ask them, would I? You're right, I know, though because I asked her. She brought me up to be frank and ask her anything, and she'd always tell me the truth. No, but I was talking about how she must feel about me now. The Movement is her life. And it must be the final knockout for her if she knows I was the one who sold-- - Shut up, damn you. - It'll kill her. And I'm sure she knows it must have been me. But I never thought the cops would get her. Please, believe that. I know, I'll admit what I told you last night was a lie, all that bunk about my getting patriotic and my duty to my country. But here's the true reason, Larry, the only reason. It was just for money. I got stuck on a broad and wanted dough to blow in on her and have a good time. That's all I did it for, just money. - Will you shut up? What the hell is it to me? - What's comin' off here? - Nothing, this gabby young punk is talking my ear off, that's all. He's a worse pest than Hickey. - Oh yeah, Hickey. Say, what do ya mean about him bein' scared you'd ask him questions? What questions? - I think he's hiding something, that's what. You notice he didn't say what his wife died of. - Aw, lay off that, the poor guy. What are you gettin' at, anyway? You don't think it's just a gag of his? - I don't. I'm damned sure that he brought death here with him. I feel the cold touch of it on him. - Aw, bunk. You got croakin' on the brain, Old Cemetery. Say. Do you mean she committed suicide on account of his cheatin' or somethin'? - It wouldn't surprise me, I'd be the last to blame her. - But that's crazy. Jeez, if she'd done that, he wouldn't tell us he was glad about it, would he? He ain't that big of a bastard, is he? - You know better than that, Larry. You know she'd never commit suicide. She's like you. She'll hang on to life even when there's nothing left but-- - And how about you? If you had any guts or decency! - Well, I suppose I'd take that hop off that fire escape you're too yellow to take. Oh, no. Who am I to judge? I'm through with judging. - Yes, I suppose you'd like that, wouldn't you? - What the hell's all this about? What do you know about Hickey's wife? How do ya know she didn't-- - He doesn't. Hickey's addled what little brains he's got. Shove him back to his own table, I'm sick of him. - You heard Larry? I'd like an excuse to give ya a good punch in the snoot. So, move quick. - If you think moving will get rid of me. If she committed suicide, ya got to feel sorry for Hickey, huh? Ya can understand how he'd go bughouse and not be responsible for all the crazy stunts he's stagin' here. But how can ya feel sorry for him when you know he says he's glad she she done it, and you can tell he means it? Aw, nuts. I don't get nowhere tryin' to figure his game. But I know this, he better lay off me and my stable. Aw gee, Larry, what a night them two pigs give me. When the party went dead, they pinched a couple a bottles and brung it up their room and got stinko. I don't get a wink of sleep, see? Just as I'd drop off on a chair here, they come down lookin' for trouble. Or else they raise hell upstairs, laughin' and singin', so then I get scared they'd get the joint pinched and go up and tell 'em to can the noise. And every time they'd crawl my frame with the same old argument. "So ya agreed with Hickey, do ya, ya dirty little Ginny? "So, we're whores, are we? "Well, we agree with Hickey about you, see. "You're nothin' but a lousy pimp." Then I'd slap them. Oh, not beat 'em up like a pimp would, just slap them. But it don't do no good. They'd keep at it over and over. Jeez, I get the earache just thinkin' of it. "Listen," they say, "if we're whores, "we got a right to have a regular pimp "and not stand for no punk imitation. "We're sick of wearin' out our dogs "poundin' sidewalks for a double-crossin' bartender, "when all the thanks we get is he looks down on us. "We gonna find us a guy who really needs us "to take care of him and ain't ashamed of it. "We're goin' on strike and you can like it or lump it." Whores goin' on strike. Can ya tie that? They say, "We're takin' a holiday. "We're goin' to beat it to Coney Island and shoot the chutes "and maybe we'll come back and maybe we won't. "And you can go to hell." So, they put on their lids and beat it, the both of them stinko. - Hey, Rocky. Cora wants a sherry flip. For her nerves. - Sherry flip. She don't need nothin' for her nerve. What's she think this is, the Waldorf? - I told her, what would we use for sherry, and there wasn't no egg unless she laid one. She says, "Is there a law ya can't go out "and buy the makings, ya big tramp?" Oh, to hell with her, she'll drink booze or nothin'. - Oh jeez, a guy oughta buy his bride anything on the weddin' day she wants, I should think. Huh, pipe the bridegroom, Larry. All dolled up for the killin'. - [Chuck] Ah, shut up. - One day on that farm in Jersey, that's what I'll give ya. Then you'll come runnin' in here some night yelling for a shot of booze because the crickets is after ya. Jeez, Chuck, that louse Hickey's certainly made a prize couple a suckers outta youse. - What's he got to do with it? Ain't we always said we was goin' to? Well, we're goin' to, see? And don't give me no arguments. (Chuck groaning) If Cora'd only give me a minute to rest all night. The same old stuff over and over. Do I really want to marry her? I says, "Sure, baby, why not?" She says, "Yeah, but after a week, "you'll be thinkin' what a sap you was. "You'll make that an excuse to go off on a periodical, "and then I'll be tied for life to a no-good soak, "and the first thing I know, "you'll have me out hustlin' again, your own wife." Then she busts out cryin'. Well, it makes me mad. I say, "I wish I was drunk right now because if I was, "you wouldn't be keeping me awake all night beefin'. "If you opened your yap, "and I'd knock the stuffin' outta ya." Then she yells, "That's a sweet way "to talk to the girl you're gonna marry." Oh gee, she's got me hangin' by the ropes. I wish I'd had a a quart of this redeye under my belt right now. - Well, why the hell don't ya? - Oh, you'd like that, wouldn't ya? I'm wise to you. You don't want to see me get married and settle down like a regular guy. You'd like me to stay paralyzed all the time, so I could be like you, a lousy pimp. - Listen! I don't take that even from you, see. - Oh, you want to make somethin' of it? Oh, don't make me laugh. You see, I could beat 10 of you with one mitt. - Not with lead in your belly, you won't. - Aw Chuck, Rocky, come on, cut it out. (Chuck and Rocky yelling) I'll cut your guts out, you dirty sons of bitches. - Yeah, that's it, go on, murder each other, you damned crazy loons, with Hickey's blessing. Didn't I tell you he'd brought death with him, huh? - All right, you, let go that shiv, and I'll put this gat away. - (chuckles) Hello, little peoples. Never mind. Soon you will eat hot dogs beneath the willow trees and drink free wine! That champagne was not properly iced. Rotten damned liar, Hickey. Does that prove I want to be aristocrat? I love only the proletariat. I will lead them. I will be like a god to them. They will be my slaves. Oh! I'm very drunk, no, Larry? I talk foolishness. I am so drunk, Larry, old friend, am I not? I don't know what I say? - Yes, you're a raving drunk, Hugo. I've never seen you so plastered. Lay your head down now and sleep it off. - [Hugo] Yeah, I should sleep. I'm so crazy drunk. - The bread's cut and my job's finished. Do I get the drink I earned? I'm finished with this dump for keeps. There's the key to my room, I ain't comin' back. I'm goin' to my own folks where I belong. I don't stay where I ain't wanted. I'm sick and tired of messin' around with white men. (Joe sighs) - What the hell? - I'm just saving you the trouble, white boy. Now you don't have to break it soon as my back's turned, so no white man will kick about drinkin' from the same glass. I's tired of loafin' around with a lot of bums. I'm a gamblin' man. I'm gonna get in a big crap game. Yeah, and I'm gonna win me a big bankroll. Then I'm gonna come back here, and after I get my gamblin' house open, for colored men, come visit the bums. Yeah, maybe I throw a $20 bill on the bar and I say, "Drink it up," and listen while you pat me on the back and you say, "Joe, you sure is white." But I'll say, "No, I'm black "and my dough is black man's dough, "and you proud to drink with me "or else you don't get no dough, no, no, no drink." Or maybe I'll just say, "You can all go to hell. "I don't lower myself drinkin' with no white trash." And that ain't no pipe dream. I'll get the dough for my stake today, somehow, somewhere. If I gotta borrow a gun someplace and stick up some white man, I get it. You wait and see. - Can ya beat the nerve of that dinge. If I wasn't dressed up, I'd go out and mop up the street with him. - Aw, let him go, him and his gamblin' house. He'll be comin' back tonight askin' Harry for his room and bummin' me for a ball. Then I'll be the one to smash the glass. I'll learn him his little place. - Oh, here's another guy all dolled up. - [Rocky] You look sick, Willie. Here, take a ball, it'll pick ya up. - No, thanks, the only way to stop is to stop. I have no chance if I went to the DA's office smelling of booze. - [Chuck] Are you really goin' there? - I said I was, didn't I? I came back here to rest a few minutes, not because I needed any booze! Cheap drummer I don't have to have any Dutch courage. He's been very kind and considerate staking me. He can't help his insulting manner, I suppose. My feet are a bit shaky yet. I better rest for a few minutes. - [Chuck] Here's another one. - Good morning, gentlemen all, and a jolly fine morning it is too, isn't it? Eh, an eye-opener? No, no, no, no, I think not. Rocky, Rocky, it's not required, old chum. (coughs) I feel extremely fit, as a matter of fact. Though I can't say slept much thanks to that interfering ass Hickey and that stupid bounder of a Boer. I've had about all I can take from that fellow. This was my own fault, of course, for allowing a brute of a Dutch farmer to become familiar, but it's come to a parting of the ways now, and good riddance. Which reminds me, here's my key. I shan't be coming back, you know? Oh no, no. Sorry to be leaving good old Harry and the rest of you, but I cannot bear to spend another day under the same roof with that, oh good Lord. - So, Hickey's kidded the pants off of you too, huh? Ya think you're leavin' here, huh? - Yeah, that's what he kids himself. - [Cecil] Yes, I am leaving, as a matter of fact, Rocky, but that ass Hickey has nothing to do with it. I've been thinking things over. IT's time I turned over a new leaf. - He's going to get a job. That's what he says. - What at? - All right, well, anything. I mean, nothing manual, of course, but anything that requires a little bit of brains and education. There's a pal of mine at the Consulate. He promised that any time I felt an energetic fit, he'd, well, he'd get me a post with the Cunard, clerk in the office or something of the sort. - Yeah, the Limey Consulate they promise him anything to get rid of him. They're afraid to call the police and have him pinched for fear what a scandal it'd make about a Limey officer and a gentleman. - As a matter of fact, Rocky, I only wish a post temporarily. Means to an end, you know. Save up enough for a first-class passage home. - Yeah, he's going to sail away to home, sweet home. That's biggest pipe dream of them all. What little brains that poor Limey has that whiskey hasn't mixed up, that Hickey has made crazy. - Eh, Hickey ain't made no sucker outta you, huh? You're too foxy? Bet you think you're goin' out and land a job too. - I am, yeah. And for me, it is easy because I put on no airs of gentlemen. I am not afraid to work with my hands. - There was a rumor in South Africa, Rocky, that a certain Boer officer, if you CAN call the leaders of a rabble of farmers officers, kept advising Cronje to retreat and not stand and fight. - And I was right. He got surrounded at Poardeberg. He had to surrender there. - Good strategy, no doubt, but a suspicion grew into a conviction among the Boers that the officer's caution was prompted by a desire to make his personal escape. Ooh, his countrymen were extremely savage about it, and his family disowned him. So, I imagine there would be no welcoming committee waiting on the dock for him, nor delighted relatives making the fields ring with their happy cries-- - Lies! All lies, you hot foot, damn thing Limey. I too have heard rumors of a Limey officer and a gentleman who, after the war, gambled away all his money when he was drunk, only it was regiment money he gambled away. - You bloody Dutch scum. - [Rocky] Cut it out. - [Piet] Let him come. (Larry laughing) Now, you can't say that Hickey hasn't the miraculous touch to raise the dead when he can start the Boer War raging again. (laughs) - Yes, well, well, well, it's time I was on my merry way to see my chap at the Consulate. The early bird catches the job, what? (Cecil laughs) Yes, well, goodbye, Rocky, and good luck, everyone. - Well, if that bloody Limey can go, I can go. - [Rocky] Well, why don't ya beat it? - Well, I just happened to think. I mean, it's hardly the decent thing to pop off without saying goodbye to good old Harry. Why, he's one of the best, old Harry, and good old Jimmy too. Well, they ought to be down any moment now. I'm sorry, I seem to be blocking your way out. - Oh, no, no. No, I just wait to say goodbye to Harry and Jimmy too. - Gee, can ya beat them simps? Hell, I'd forgot Cora. She'll be throwin' a fit. - [Rocky] That's right, wait on her and spoil her, ya poor sap. (Don groans) - Look here, Parritt. I'd like to have a talk with you. - What about? - About the trouble you're in. Oh, I know, you don't admit it. You're quite right, that's my advice. Deny everything, keep your mouth shut. Make no statements whatever without first consulting your attorney. - Say, what the hell? - But you can trust me. I'm a lawyer, and it just occurred to me that you and I ought to cooperate. Of course, I'm going to the DA's office this morning to see about a job on his staff. But that may take time. Meanwhile, it would be a good idea for me to take a case or two on my own to prove my brilliant record in law school was no flash in the pan. So, why not retain me as your attorney? - You're crazy, what do I want with a lawyer? - That's right, that's right, don't admit anything, but you can trust me, so let's not beat about the bush, huh? Remember, they get you in the end. I know from my father's experience. No one could have felt safer than him When anybody mentioned the law, he nearly died laughing. - You crazy mutt. Gee, did you get that, Larry? This damned fool thinks the cops are after me. - I wish to God they were. And so should you, if you had the honor of a louse. - And you're the guy who kids himself he's through with the Movement? Why, you old lying faker, you're still in love with it. - Then you're not in trouble, Parritt? I was hoping that, but it's all right, no offense meant. Forget it. - Oh no, that's all right, Willie. I'm not sore at you. It's this damned old faker that gets my goat. It's really Mother you still love, isn't it? But I can understand how you still can't help feeling because I love her too. You know I do, don't you? So you see, I couldn't have expected that they would be caught. You've got to believe me. It was just to get a few lousy dollars to blow in on a broad, and no other reason, honest. That's all I did it for. - For the love of God, I told you, you can't make me judge you. If you don't keep quiet, you'll be saying something soon that will make you vomit your own soul like a drink of rotgut that won't stay down. To hell with you. - Please, Larry. You've got to help me. - Set 'em up, Rocky. I swore I'd have no drinks with Hickey if I died of drought, but I've changed my mind. And he owes it to me, and I'd get blind to the world today if it was the iceman of death himself treating. What made me say that, I wonder. Damn, it fits. Death was the iceman that Hickey called to his home. (dramatic music) - Well, good morning, Rocky. Hello, Larry. I'm glad to see Brother Hickey hasn't corrupted you to temperance. Ooh, I wouldn't mind a shot myself. No, no, much as I need it after the hell of a night I've spent with that drummer son of a drummer. You know that I had to lock him out? But I could still hear him doin' his spiel through door all night long. He was still at it with Harry and Jimmy when I came down just now. Oh, but the hardest to take was that flannel-mouth, flatfoot Mick trying to tell me where I got off. I had to lock him out too. - He's a liar, Rocky. It was me locked him out. - You're just the man I want to see. If I'm to handle your case, we better have a talk before we leave. - We'll have no talk. You think I want your father's son for my lawyer? Huh, they'd take one look at you and bounce us both out on our necks. I don't need a lawyer anyway. All I've got to do is see the right ones and get them to pass the word. They will too. They know I was framed. - Oh God, I'll be glad to leave this crazy house. There's my key, Rocky. - And here's mine. I'd rather sleep in the gutter than spend another night under the same roof with that loon Hickey and a lying circus grifter. And if that hat fits anyone here, let him put it on. - Why you! - Oh, Rocky-- - I'll get you! - Nix! - Hey! - Take it easy. You birds give me a pain. It'd serve you right if I wouldn't give the keys back to ya tonight. - Hello, everybody. (Cora gasps) Here we go. Hickey said, we'd better beat it, if we're really goin'. So, we're showin' that no-good drummer, ain't we, honey? He's upstairs with Harry and Jimmy. Jeez, them two look like they was going to the electric chair. (giggles) hey, come on, honey, let's get out of here - Sure, anything you say, baby. - before he comes down. Anything, yeah? Well, I say we stop at the first regular dump we come to and you gotta blow me to a sherry flip, or four or five, if I want 'em, or else all bets is off. - You got a big bun on now. - Oh, I know, I know what's eatin' you, tightwad, all right. We'll use my dough then. You'll take it all right after the ceremony anyways, so I know you, here, ya big-- - Keep your lousy dough. - Hey! - Don't show off your legs to these bums when you're gonna be married, if you don't want a sock in the puss. - All right, honey. Hey, why don't all you barflies come to the weddin'? Well, here we go, guys. Say, Rocky, what are ya, you deaf or somethin'? I said Chuck and me was goin'. - Well, goodbye, give my love to Jersey. - Ain't ya gonna wish us happiness, ya dirty little Ginny? - Sure, here's hopin' ya don't murder each other before next week. - Aw, baby, what do we care for that pimp? Here's Hickey comin' now, let's get outta here. - One regular guy and an all-right tart gone to hell. That louse Hickey oughta be croaked. - Well, here we are. (laughs) We've got this far, at least. Good work, Jimmy. I told you you weren't half as sick as you pretended. No excuse whatever for postponing-- - I'll thank you to keep your hands off me. I merely mentioned I'd feel more fit tomorrow. Well, might as well be today, I suppose. - Finish it now, so it'll be dead forever, and you can be free. (chuckles) Cheer up, Governor. You found your rheumatism didn't bother you coming downstairs, didn't you? You're the damnedest one for alibis, Governor. As bad as Jimmy. - What's that? Can't hear ya. You're a liar. I've had rheumatism off and on for the last 20 years, ever since Bessie died, everyone knows that. - Yes, everyone knows it's the kind of rheumatism you turn off and on. Oh, we're on to you, you old faker. (laughs) - Well, what are all you bums staring at me? Think you was watching a circus. Go on, go on off about your business, like Hickey told it to you? - Yes, Harry, I certainly thought they'd have had the guts to be gone by this time. Or maybe I did have my doubts because I know exactly what you're up against, boys. I know how damned yellow a man can be when it comes to facin' himself, and yet, as I've told you over and over, it's exactly those damned tomorrow dreams which keeps a man from making peace with himself. So, you've got to kill 'em like I did mine. Well, come on, boys. Let's get moving. (laughs) Who'll start the ball rolling? You, Captain, and you, General. You're nearest the door. Besides, you're old war heroes. Come on, show us some of that good old Battle of Modder River spirit we've heard so much about, hmm? Well, you can't sit around here all day acting as if you were scared the street outside would bite you. - Right you are, Mister Bloody Nosey Parker. It's time I was off. I only stayed behind to say goodbye to you, Harry, old chum. - [Harry] Goodbye, Captain, hope you have luck. - Oh, I'm bound to, I'm bound to. On. - All right, if that lousy Limey can go, I can go. (Hickey chuckling) - Next? Come on, Ed, it's a fine summer's day, and I'm sure the lure of the old circus lot must be in your blood, hmm? (Ed coughing) (Pat laughing) That's the stuff, Mac. (Ed laughing) - [Ed] Goodbye, Harry. (laughing) - If that lying grifter has the guts. - Goodbye, Harry, and thanks for all your kindness. - [Harry] Bye, Willie. - That's the way, Willie. The DA's a busy man. He can't wait all day for you, you know? (laughs) And now it's your turn, Jimmy, old pal. Aw, now, now, Jimmy, you can't do that to yourself. Why, one drink on top of that hangover and an empty stomach and you'll be orey-eyed. - Tomorrow, I will tomorrow. I'll be all right tomorrow. - Nah, nah, nah. - All right, I'm going, take your hands off me. - That's the spirit, you'll thank me when it's all over. - You dirty swine. - Well, all set for an alcohol rub, huh? No hard feelings, I know how he feels. I've seen the day when if anyone forced me to face the truth, I'd have shot them dead. (Hickey giggles) Well now, Governor, Jimmy made the grade, it's up to you. Oh now, come on, Harry, if he's got the guts to go through it-- - Leave Harry alone. - Oh, I'd make up my mind about myself if I was you, Larry, and not bother over Harry. He'll come through all right, I promised him that. He doesn't need anyone's bum pity. Do you, Governor? - No, bejeeb. You keep your nose out of this, Larry. I've always been meaning to take this walk in time. What to be scared of taking a quiet stroll around me own ward? What's the weather like outside, Rocky? - Fine day, Boss. - Well, it don't look fine to me. Looks as if it'd rain cats and dogs any minute. Ooh, ooh, my rheumatism, ah. Ah no, it's me eyes, half blind, bejeeb. Makes things look black. Ah, I see, it is a fine day now, huh. Too damned hot for walkin' if you ask me. Ah well, it might do me good, sweat some of the booze out of me. Ooh, I've got to watch out for them automobiles though. You know, there was none of them around the last time, 20 years ago. And from what I can see of them from the window there, they'd run over you as soon as look at you. - Yeah. - Well, not that I'm scared of them. Well aimed to look after meself. Well, so long, fellas. Well, come on, Hickey, it's time we got started. - Aw, Harry, can't be done. You've gotta keep a date with yourself alone. - Well, a hell of a guy, you are. I thought you'd be willing to see me across the street, seeing I'm half blind and deaf too. Can't hear those damned automobiles. Well, to hell with you. I've never needed no one's help and I don't now. You know, what gets me, Hickey, is I can't help thinking the last time I went through that door, it was to poor Bessie's funeral. After she'd gone, I didn't feel life was worth livin'. Swore I'd never go out again. Somehow, it doesn't feel right for me to go even now, Hickey. It's like as if I was doing wrong to her memory. - Now, now, Governor, you can't let yourself get away with that one anymore. - I remember now clear as day the last time. Aye, it was just before she, it was a fine Sunday morning. We was going out to church together. - It's a great act, Governor, a great act, but you know better and do I! You never did want to go to church or any place else with her. She was always on your neck making you go out and do things when all you wanted was to get drunk in peace. - You're a damned liar. Bejeeb, if there was a mad dog outside, I'd go and shake hands with it rather than stay here with you. (Hickey laughing) - Jeez, he made it. I'd have give ya 50 to one, he'd never make it. Aw, aw, he stopped. I'll bet ya he'll be comin' back. - Sure, he's coming back, so are all the others. By tonight, they'll all be here again. You dumbbell, that's the whole point. (laughing) - No, he ain't neither. He's down to the curb. He's lookin' up and down, scared stiff of automobiles. There ain't more than two an hour comes down this street, the old boob. - Now, it's my turn, I suppose? You think when I say I'm finished with life, that I'll welcome closing my eyes in the long sleep of death, you think that's a coward's lie? - Well, what do you think, Larry? - Well, I'm afraid to live, am I? And even more afraid to die. So, I sit here, with my pride drowned on the bottom of a bottle so that I can't see myself shaking in my britches with fright, or hear myself whining and praying. Beloved Christ, let me live a little longer. if only for a few days or a few hours even. Have mercy, Almighty God, and let me still clutch greedily to my heart this sweet treasure, this jewel beyond price, the dirty, stinking bit of withered old flesh that's my beautiful little life. You think you'll make me admit that to myself? - But you just did admit it, didn't you? - (laughs) That's the stuff, Hickey. Show the old yellow faker up. He can't play dead on me like this. He's got to help me. - Yes, Larry, you've got to settle with him. I'm leaving you entirely in his hands. He'll do as good a job as I could at making you give up that old grandstand bluff. - I'll see the two of you in hell first. - Jeez, Harry's startin' across the street. He's gonna fool ya, Hickey. What the hell is he stoppin' for? Right in the middle of the street. You'd think he was paralyzed or somethin'. Aw, aw, he's quittin'. He's turned back. Jeez, jeez, look at the old bastard travel. Here he comes. - Oh, Rocky, Rocky, Rocky, Rocky! Oh bejeeb, that scared me out of a year's growth. Oh, that guy ought to be pinched. Oh, it's not safe walkin' on the streets. Oh, that ends me. Give me that bottle. (Harry panting) You seen it, didn't you, Rocky? - Seen what? - That automobile, you dumb wop. Bejeeb, the guy driving it must be drunk or crazy. He'd have run right over me if I hadn't jumped. Larry, have a drink. Aw come on, everybody, everybody, have a drink. Rocky, have a cigar, I know you hardly ever touch it. - This is the time I do touch it. And I'm gonna get stinko, see. And if you don't like it, you know what you can do. Jeez, Harry, I thought ya had some guts. I was bettin' you'd make it and show that four-flusher up. Automobile, hell. Who do ya think you're kiddin'? There wasn't no automobile. You just quit cold. - Well, bejeeb, I ought to know, it almost killed me. - Now, now, Governor, don't be foolish. You've faced the test and come through. You're rid of all that nagging dream stuff now. You know you can't believe it anymore. - Larry, you seen it, didn't you? Aw come on, have a drink, Larry. Have all you want. Ah, we'll go on a grand old souse together, Larry. You saw that automobile, didn't ya, Larry. - Sure, I saw it, Harry. You had a narrow escape. Damn, I thought you were a goner. - What in the hell is the matter with you, Larry? You know what I told you about the wrong kind of pity. Leave Harry alone. Gee, you would think I was trying to harm him, the fool way you act. My oldest friend. What kind of a louse do you think I am? There isn't anything I wouldn't do for Harry. All I'm trying to do is fix it so he'll be finally at peace with himself for the rest of his days. And if you'll just wait until the final returns are in, you'll find out that's exactly what I've done. Come on, now, Governor. Don't be stubborn now that it's all over and dead? Give up that ghost automobile. - Yes, what's the use now? All a lie. There was no automobile. But something ran over me. Must have been myself. Guess I'll sit down. I feel all in. Like a corpse, bejeeb. Hello, Hugo. Coming up for air? Stay passed out, that's the right dope. There ain't any cool willow trees, unless you grow your own in a bottle. - Hello, little Harry, (giggles) you little monkey face. We will drink champagne beneath the willow, but the slaves must ice it properly. Rotten damned Hickey. Peddler pimp for nouveau-riche capitalism. When I lead the jackass mob to the sack of Babylon, I will make them hang him to a lamppost the first one. - Good work. I'll help pull on the rope. Have a drink, Hugo. - No, no, thank you. I'm too drunk now. I hear myself say crazy things. Do not listen, please. Larry will tell you, I've never been so crazy drunk. I must sleep it off. What's matter, Harry? You look funny. Oh, you look dead. What's the matter? I don't know you. Listen, I feel I'm dying too because I'm so crazy drunk. It's very necessary that I sleep, but I can't sleep here with you. You look dead. - Another one who's begun to enjoy your peace. - Huh? Oh, I know it's tough on him right now, but that's only the first shock. They'll both come through all right. - You believe that, I see you do, you mad fool. - But of course, I believe it. I tell you I know from my own experience. - Close that big clap of yours, Hickey. You're a worse gabber than that nagging bitch Bessie ever was. - Jeez, did ya hear that? - What's wrong with the booze? There's no life in it. - Jeez, Larry, Hugo had it right. He does look like he croaked. - Don't be a damned fool. Give him time, he'll come along all right. You're all right, aren't you, Harry? - I want to pass out like Hugo. - It's the peace of death you've brought him. - That's a lie! (Hickey laughing) Oh well, you did manage to get a rise out of me there then, didn't ya, Larry? It's just that I think such a hell of a lot of Harry. How's it coming, Governor? Getting over the first shock? Relieved and not guilty anymore? - You've been monkeying with the booze too, you interfering bastard. There's no life in it anymore. I want to pass out. Let's all pass out. Who the hell cares. - Well, I admit I didn't think it would hit him quite so hard. He's always been a happy-go-lucky slob like I was. Of course, it hit me hard too. But only for a minute, and then I felt as if a ton of guilt had been lifted off my mind. And I knew what had happened was the only possible way for the peace of all concerned. - What was it happened? Tell us that. Don't try to get out of it. I want a straight answer. I think it's something you drove someone else to do. - Someone else? - How did your wife die? I notice you've kept that a pretty big secret so far for some reason. - Well, that's not very considerate of you, Larry. But if you insist on knowing, there's no reason why you shouldn't. It was a bullet through the head that killed Evelyn. - So, you drove your poor wife to suicide, huh? I knew it, and now I don't blame her. I'd almost do as much myself to get rid of you. It's what you'd like to drive us all to do! Oh, oh, I'm sorry, Hickey. Rotten louse to throw that in your face. - Oh, that's all right, Larry. But don't jump at conclusions. I didn't say poor Evelyn committed suicide. Why it's the last thing she'd ever have done as long as I was alive for her to take care of and forgive. I mean, if you'd known her at all, you'd never get such a crazy suspicion. No, I'm sorry to have to tell you, my poor wife was killed. - She was murdered. - You're a liar, Larry. You must be crazy to say that to me. You know she's still alive. - Murdered, who done it? - Don't ask questions, you dumb wop. It's none of our business. Leave Hickey alone. - Still the old grandstand bluff, huh, Larry? Or is it some more of your bum pity? The police don't know who did it yet, Rocky, but I expect they will before long. Well, coming along fine now, aren't you, Governor? Beginning to feel free from lying hopes and guilt and at peace. - Somebody croaked your Evelyn? My bets are on the iceman. And who the hell cares? What did you do to the booze, Hickey? There's no life in it. - Don't look like that, Larry. You've got to believe what I told you. It had nothing to do with her. It was just to get a few lousy dollars. - Buy me a drink, don't be fools! But no more wine. It's not been properly iced. Rotten damned stupid proletarian slaves. Buy me a drink or I'll have you shot! Oh please, for God's sake. I cannot sleep, I am not drunk enough. (sobbing) Life is a crazy monkey face. Always there's blood beneath the willow trees. I hate it, I'm afraid. Oh, please, I'm crazy drunk. I say crazy things. For God's sake, don't listen to me. (Hickey chuckles) - You're beginning to worry me, Governor. Something's holding you up somewhere. I don't see why. YOu've done what you had to do to get rid of your nagging pipe dreams Oh, I know it knocks you cold, but only for a minute. And then, you'll see it was the only possible way to peace. And you'll feel happy, like I did. That's what worries me about you, Governor. It's time you began to feel happy. (dramatic music) (bell ringing) (Joe groaning) - Come on, come on, nigger, beat it in the back room. It's after hours. Aw, the hell with it. Let the dump get pinched. I'm through with this lousy job anyway. Who's that? Been scrappin', huh? Started off on your periodical, ain't ya? - Yeah, ain't ya glad? What's it to ya? - Not a thing. But this is something to me. I'm out on my feet holding down your job. You said if I'd take your day, you'd relieve me at six. Well, it's half past one a.m. Well, you're takin' over now, get me, no matter how plastered ya are. - Plastered, hell, I wished I was. I've lapped up a gallon, but it don't hit me right. To hell with the job. I'm tellin' Harry I'm quittin'. What a prized sap you've been, tendin' bar when ya got two good hustlers in your stable. - Yeah, well I ain't no sap now. I'll learn 'em when they get back from Coney. Jeez, that Cora sure played you for a dope, feedin' ya that marriage-on-a-farm hop. - Yeah, Hickey, Hickey got the right dope. It was her pulling them sherry flips on me woke me up. All the way walkin' to the ferry, every ginmill we come to, she'd drag me. I got to thinkin', "Gee, what won't she want "when she gets the ring on her finger and I'm hooked?" So, I tells her at the ferry, "Kiddo, ya can go to Jersey or to hell, but count me out." - Aw, she says it was her told you to go to hell because you start hittin' the booze. - And I got thinkin' too, "Gee, "won't I look sweet with a wife "that if ya put all the guys she's stayed with side by side, "they'd reach to Chicago." Yeah, that kind of dame, ya can't trust 'em. The minute your back is turned, they're out cheatin' with the iceman or somebody. Hickey, Hickey done me a favor, wakin' me up. It was fun, kinda, me and Cora kiddin' ourselves. Yeah, where is that no-good bastard, Hickey? And I want one good sock at that guy, just one! (speaking in foreign language) - Keep away from him, Chuck. - Sockin' 'em I'll do it, do it tomorrow! - Keep away from him. - I'm gonna take a chance, I'm goin' to the chair! (speaks in foreign language) - He ain't here now anyway. He went out to phone. He said he wouldn't call from here. But I got a hunch he beat it. But if he does come back, you don't know him, if anyone asks, you get me? The chair, maybe that's where he's goin'. I don't know nothin', see, but it looks like he croaked his wife. - You mean she really was cheatin' on him? Then I don't blame the guy. - I don't give a damn what he done to his wife, but if he gets the hot seat, I won't go into no mournin'. - Oh, me neither. - Not after his throwin' it in my face I'm a pimp. What if I am, why the hell not? And what he's done to Harry? Gee, the poor old slob is so licked he can't even get drunk. And all the gang, they're all licked. Jimmy Tomorrow was the last. Schwartz the copper brung him in. Saw him sittin' on the dock lookin' at the water and cryin'. Sheesh, there ain't enough guts left in the whole gang to battle a mosquito. - Aw, to hell with 'em. Who cares? Give me a drink. Hey, I see you been hittin' the redeye too. - Yeah, but it don't do no good. I can't get drunk right. That dirty dinge was able to get his snootful and pass out. Gee, even Hickey can't faze a nigger. You'd think he was fazed if you'd seen him come in. Stinko, and he pulled a gat and said he'd plug Hickey for insultin' him. Then dropped it and begun to cry and said he wasn't a gamblin' man or a tough guy no more, he was yellow. - He's got no business in the bar after hours. Why don't ya chuck him out? - Aw, to hell with it. Who cares? - I don't. - 'Scuse me, white boys. 'Scuse me for livin'. I don't stay where I ain't wanted. - My pig's in the back room, ain't she? Well, I'm gonna collect the dough I wouldn't take this mornin', like a sucker, before she blows it. - Eh, I'm comin' too. I'm through workin', I ain't no lousy bartender. - If you object to my sittin' here, Captain, you just tell me and I'll pull my freight. - No apology required, Joseph, old chum. Anybody could tell you I should feel honored that a bloody kaffir would lower himself to sit beside me. - I'm waitin', baby. Dig. - Sure, I been expectin', I got it all ready. Here. Jeez, imagine me kiddin' myself I wanted to marry a lousy pimp. - That's nothin', baby. Imagine the sap I'da been when I can get the dough just as easy without it, huh? - Hello there, Old Cemetery. Hello, Tightwad. You still around? - Ask Larry. He knows I'm here, all right, although he's pretending not to. Like to forget I'm alive. Still trying to kid himself with that grandstand philosopher stuff. But he can't get away with it now. Kept himself locked in his room until just a while ago. Alone with a bottle of booze, but he couldn't make it work. He couldn't even get drunk. Just had to come out. Must have been something there he was even more afraid to face than he was Hickey and me. I guess he got looking at the fire escape thinking how handy it was, if he was really sick of life and only had the guts to die. He's been thinking of me too, Rocky. Trying to figure a way to get out of helping me. He doesn't want to be bothered understanding. But he does understand, all right. He used to love her too. So, he thinks that I ought to take a hop off the fire escape. - Damn it all to hell, are you trying to make me your executioner? - Execution? Then you do think that that's? - I don't think anything! - What am I doin' here with youse two? I remember I had something on my mind. What? Oh, I got it now. I was thinking how you was both regular guys. I thinks, "Ain't two guys like them saps "to be hangin' around like a couple a stew bums "and wastin' themselves?" Not that I blame ya for not workin', only suckers work. But there's no percentage in bein' broke when you can grab good jack for yourself and let someone else work for ya, is there? I mean, like I do. Ain't I right? Sure, I am. So, don't be a sucker, see? Hey, you ain't a bad lookin' guy. Ya could make a hustler who's a good gal and start a stable, and I'll help ya and wise ya up to the inside dope on the game. Well, what about it? What if they do call you dirty names? What the hell do you care anymore than I do? - I'm through with all whores. I wish they were all in jail or dead! - So ya won't touch it, huh? All right, stay a bum. Jeez, Larry, he's one dumb boob, ain't he? Dead from the neck up. He doesn't know a good thing when he sees it. But how 'bout you, Larry? You ain't so dumb, so why not, huh? All the hustlers think you're aces. It'd be a pipe for you, especially with me to help ya and wise ya up. Ya wouldn't have to worry where the next drink's comin' from or wear dirty clothes. Well, don't it look good to ya? - No, it doesn't look good, Rocky. I mean, the kina peace that Hickey's brought you. It isn't contented enough if you have to make everyone else a pimp too. - I'm a sap to waste time on you. A stew bum is a stew bum and you can't change him. Jeez, we all ought to get drunk and stage a celebration when that bastard goes to the chair. - I'll celebrate with you and drink long life to him in hell. Ah, the poor mad devil. Oh, pity again, the wrong kind. He'd welcome the chair. - Yes, what are you so damned scared of death for? I don't want your lousy pity. - Gee, I hope he don't come back, Larry. We don't know nothin' now. We're only guessin', see? But if the bastard keeps on talkin'-- - Oh, he'll come back and he'll keep on talking. He has to. He's lost his confidence that the peace he's sold us is the real McCoy, and it's made him uneasy about his own. He'll have to prove to us-- - That's a damn lie, Larry. I haven't lost confidence a damned bit. Why should I? By God, whenever I made up my mind to sell someone something, I knew they ought to want, I've sold 'em. (chuckles) I mean, that isn't very kind of you, Larry, to make a crack like that when I've been doing my best to help. - Keep away from me. I don't know nothin' about ya, see? - Well, well. (laughing) How are we coming along, everybody? I'm sorry I had to leave you for a while, but there was something I had to finally get settled. It's all fixed now. - When are you going to do something about this booze, Hickey? We all know you did something to take the life out of it. It's like drinking dishwater. We can't pass out and you promised us peace. (all murmuring) - Oh, for God's sake, Harry, are you still harping on that damned nonsense. You've kept it up all afternoon and night and now you got everybody else singing that same damn crazy tune. I've had about all I can stand, that's why I phoned. (Hickey chuckles) Excuse me, boys and girls, I didn't mean that. I'm just worried about you when you play dead on me like this. I thought by the time I got back, you'd be like you ought to be, hmm? (chuckles) Oh, but I've explained all that a million times. You've all done what you needed to do. By rights you should be carefree and contented now, without a single damned hope or lying dream left to torment you. But here you sit, acting like a lot of stiffs cheating the undertaker. I can't figure, unless it's just your damned pig-headed stubbornness. Aw hell, don't act this way with me, gang. You're my old pals, the only friends I ever have. You know the one thing I want is to see you all happy before I go. Damned little time left now. We've got to get busy right away and find out what's wrong. (Hickey chuckling) Well, can't you appreciate what you've got, for God's sake? Can't you see? You're free now to be yourselves, without having to feel remorse or guilt or lie to yourselves about reforming tomorrow. There is no tomorrow now. You're rid of it forever, you've killed it. You don't have to give a damn what you are anymore. You've finally got the game of life licked, can't you see that? Aw, why don't you get pie-eyed and celebrate? Why don't you laugh and sing "Sweet Adeline"? The only reason I can figure is you're putting on this rotten half-dead act is just to get back at me because you hate my guts. Now, don't do that to me, gang. It makes me feel like hell to think you hate me. It makes me feel you suspect I must have hated you. But that's a lie. Oh, I know, I used to hate everyone in the world that wasn't as rotten a bastard as I was, but that was when I was still living in hell, before I faced the truth and saw the one possible way to free poor Evelyn and give her the peace she'd always dreamed about. - Aw, put a bag over it. To hell with Evelyn. What if she was cheatin'? Who the hell cares what ya did to her? That's your funeral. (all murmuring) We don't give a damn, see? All we want outta you is keep the hell away from us and give us some rest! - The one possible way to make up to her for all I'd made her go through, so she could be rid of me and I couldn't make her suffer any more, and she wouldn't have to forgive me again. Now, I saw I couldn't do it by killing myself, as I'd wanted to for a long time. That'd have been the last straw to her. She'd have died of a broken heart to think I could do that to her. She'd have blamed herself too. And I saw I couldn't do it by just running away. She'd have died of grief and humiliation to think I could do that to her. She'd have thought I'd stopped loving her. You see, I loved Evelyn and Evelyn loved me. And that was the trouble. Been so damned easy to find a way out for her if she hadn't loved me so much or I hadn't loved her. But as it was, there was only one possible way. I had to kill her. - Mad fool, can't you keep your mouth shut! We may hate you for what you've done here this time, but we remember the other times when you brought kindness and laughter instead of death. We don't want to know things that will make us help send you to the chair. - Shut up, you yellow faker, can't you face a thing? Wouldn't I deserve the chair too, if I, it's worse if you kill someone and they have to go on living. I'd welcome the chair, it'd wipe it out. It'd square me with myself. - I wish you'd get rid of that bastard, Larry! I can't have him pretending there's anything in common between him and me. It's what's in your heart that counts. There was love in my heart, not hate. - No, hey, you lie, you lie. I couldn't hate her, I don't. And it had nothing to do with her anyway. Ask Larry. - Stop shoving your rotten soul in my lap. - Ah, now don't worry about the chair, Larry. I know it's still tough for you not to be terrified by death, but when you've made peace with yourself like I have, you simply won't give a damn, hmm? (chuckles) Now listen, everybody. I've made up my mind that the only way I can clear things up for you, to show you how carefree and contented you ought to be, now I've made you get rid of your pipe dreams, is to show you what a pipe dream did to me and Evelyn. And I'm certain if I tell you about it from the beginning, you'll appreciate what I've done for you and why I did it and how damned grateful you ought to be instead of hating me. Well, you see, even when we were kids, Evelyn and me-- - Who the hell cares? We don't want to hear it. All we want is to pass out and a little peace. (all murmuring) - All right, all right, if that's the way you feel about it. I'm not going to cram it down your throats. I don't have to tell anyone. I don't feel guilty. I'm just worried about you. - What did you do to the booze, Hickey? That's what we'd like to hear. We all know you done something to take the life out of it. Ain't that right, Jimmy? - [Chuck] Yes. - An absurd lie, all my nonsense about tomorrow. Naturally, they'd never give me my position back. I wouldn't dream of asking them. It would be hopeless. I didn't resign, I got fired for drunkenness. And that was years ago. I'm much worse now. It was absurd of me to excuse my drunkenness by pretending it was my wife's adultery that ruined my life. As Hickey guessed, I was a drunkard before that, long before. I discovered early in life that living frightened me when I was sober. I have forgotten why I married Marjorie. I can't even remember if she was pretty. She was a blonde, I think, but I couldn't swear to it. I'd some idea of wanting a home, perhaps. Hmm. Why Marjorie married me, God knows. Impossible to believe she loved me. She must have known that I much preferred drinking all night with my pals to being in bed with her. So naturally, she was unfaithful. I didn't blame her. I really didn't care. I was glad to be free, even grateful to her, I think, for giving me such a good tragic excuse to drink as much as I damned well pleased. - Guy named Hickman in the back room? - Think I know the names of all the guys? - Listen, you, this is murder. It was Hickman himself phoned in and said we could meet him here around two. - Oh, so that's who he phoned to. All right, if he asked for it. He's that guy sittin' alone. If ya want a confession all ya gotta do is listen. He'll tell you all about it. You can't stop the bastard talkin'. - I've got to tell you. Your being like you are now is all wrong, it gets my goat. It puts things in my mind about myself. It makes me think, if I got balled up about you, how do I know I didn't get balled up about myself? And that is plain damned foolishness. Why, once you know the story of me and Evelyn, you'll see there wasn't any other possible way out of it for her sake. Only I've got to start way back at the beginning or you won't understand. You see, even as a kid I was always restless. I had to keep on the go. You know the old saying, "Ministers' sons are sons of guns." Oh well, that was me and then some. Home was like a jail. And I didn't fall for that religious bunk. Listening to my old man whooping up hellfire and scaring those poor Hoosier suckers into shelling out their dough handed me a laugh, although I had to hand it to him, the way he sold them nothing for something. I guess I take after him, made me a good salesman. Well anyway, as I said, home was like jail and so was school and so was that damned hick town. The only place I liked was the pool rooms, where I could smoke Sweet Caporals and mop up a couple of beers thinking I was a real hell-on-wheels sport. Well, we had one hooker shop in town, and, of course, I liked that too. Not that I hardly ever had the entrance money. My old man was a tight old bastard. But I used to like to sit around in the parlor and joke with the girls, and they liked me 'cause I could kid 'em along and make 'em laugh. Well, you know how a small town is, hmm? Everybody called me a no-good tramp. Well, I didn't give a damn what they said. I hated everybody in the place! That is, except Evelyn. I loved Evelyn. Even as a kid. And Evelyn loved me. - I love Mother, Larry. No matter what she did, I still do. Can't you say something? - Yes, sir, as far back as I can remember, Evelyn and I loved each other. She always stuck up for me. Never would believe the gossip or she'd pretend she didn't. No one could convince her I was no good. Evelyn was stubborn as hell once she'd made her mind up, even when I'd admit things and ask her forgiveness, she'd make excuses for me and defend me against myself. She'd kiss me and she'd say she knew I didn't mean it and I wouldn't do it again, and I'd promise I wouldn't. I'd have to promise, she was so sweet and good, even though I knew damn well. No, sir, you couldn't stop Evelyn. Nothing on Earth could shake her faith in me. Even I couldn't. She was a sucker for a pipe dream. Well, naturally, her family forbid her seeing me. They were one of the town's best, rich even for that hickburg, owned the trolley line and lumber company. Strict Methodists too. And oh, ho, ho, they hated my guts. But they couldn't stop Evelyn. She'd sneak notes to me and meet me on the sly. Well, I was getting more restless and that town was getting more like a jail. And I made up my mind I had to beat it. Now, I knew what I wanted to be by then. I'd met a lot of drummers around the hotel and I liked 'em. They were always telling jokes. They were sports. They kept on the move and I liked the life. And I knew I could kid people and sell things. But the hitch was gettin' the railroad fare to the Big Town. So, I told Mollie Arlington my trouble. She was the madame of the cathouse and she liked me. She laughed and she said, "Sure kid, I'll bet on you, I'll stake you. "Why, with that grin and that line of bull, "you ought to be able to sell skunks for good ratters." (Hickey laughing) Aw, I liked Mollie. She gave me confidence in myself. And I paid her back too, I remember, the first dough that I ever earned. I wrote her a kidding letter saying I was peddling baby carriages and she and the girls ought to take advantage of our bargain offer. (Hickey laughing) Yeah, but that's getting ahead of my story. Last night before I left town, I had a date with Evelyn. Got all worked up, couldn't help it, she was so pretty and sweet and good. So, I told her straight, "You better forget me, Evelyn, "for your own sake. "I'm no good and I never will be. "I'm not fit to wipe your shoes." And I broke down and I cried. And she said, looking all white and scared, "Why, Teddy? "Don't you love me anymore?" And I said, "Love you? "God, Evelyn, I love you more than anything in the world." And she said, "But that's all that matters, Teddy "because nothing but death can stop my loving you. "So, I'll wait, and when you're ready, "you send for me and we'll get married, "And I'll make you happy, Teddy, "and when you're happy, you won't want to do "any of the bad things you done any more." And I said, "Of course, I won't, Evelyn." And I meant it. I believed it. I loved her so much she could make me believe anything. - Get it off your chest you long-winded bastard. You caught her cheating with the iceman, and you croaked her, and who the hell cares? (all groaning) - So, I beat it to the Big Town. I got a job easy, see, and for me it was a cinch for me to make good. I had the knack. It was like a game, sizing people up real quick, spotting what their pet pipe dreams were, and then kidding 'em along that line, pretending you believed what they wanted to believe about themselves. And then they liked you, they trusted you, and they wanted to buy something to show their gratitude. Ha, ha, ha, God, it was fun. But still, all the while I'd feel guilty, as if I shouldn't be having such a good time away from Evelyn. So, in each of my letters, I'd tell her how I missed her, but I'd warn her too. I'd tell her all my faults, how I liked my booze and so on. But nothing could shake her faith in me, or her dreams of the future. And after each of her letters, well, I'd be as full of faith as she was. So, after I got enough dough saved to start us off right, I sent for her and we got married. Oh God, wasn't I happy for a while? And wasn't she happy? Now look, I don't care what anyone says, I'll bet there never was two people more in love than me and Evelyn. Not only then but always after, in spite of everything I did. Well, it's all there at the start, everything that happened afterwards. I never could learn to handle temptation! (Hickey chuckles) I'd want to reform and I'd mean it. I'd promise myself, I'd promise Evelyn, I'd tell her, it's the last time. And she'd say, "I know it's the last time, Teddy. "You'll never do it again." Well, that's what made it so hard. That's what made me feel such a guilty skunk, her always forgiving me. My playing around with women, for instance. It was only a harmless good time to me. It didn't mean anything. But I knew what it meant to Evelyn. So, I'd say to myself, never again. But you know how it is, traveling around. Those damned lousy hotel rooms. I'd get so I'd see things in the wallpaper. Lonely and homesick. But at the same time sick of home too. I'd feel free, I'd want to celebrate a little. Well, I never did do any drinking on the job, so it had to be dames. Any tart. What I'd want was some tramp I could be myself with without being ashamed. Someone I could tell a dirty joke to and she'd laugh. - Jeez, all the lousy jokes I had to listen to and pretend was funny. - Oh, sometimes I'd try some joke I thought was a corker on Evelyn. She'd make herself laugh, but I could see she thought it was dirty, not funny. And she always knew about the tarts I'd been with when I come home from a trip. She'd kiss me and look in my eyes, and she'd know. And I'd look in her eyes and see how she was trying not to know, and then saying herself, well even if it was true, he couldn't help it, he hasn't got me, and he's lonely, they tempt him, it's only his body, anyway, he doesn't love them, I'm the only one he loves. And she was right! I never loved anyone else. I couldn't if I wanted to. Well, she forgave me when it all had to come out in the open. You know how it is when you keep taking chances. You get lucky for a while, but you get nicked in the end. I picked up a nail from some tart in Altoona. - Yeah. And she picked it up from some guy. It's all in the game. What the hell of it? - Well, I had to do an awful lot of lying and stalling when I got home, but it didn't do any good. The quack I went to got all my dough and then he told me I was cured, but I wasn't, and poor Evelyn. But anyway, she did her best to make me believe she fell for my lie about how traveling men get things from drinking cups on trains. Anyway, she forgave me. The same way she'd forgive me when I'd show up from one of my periodical drunks. And you all know what I'd be like at the end of one those. You've seen me. Like something lying in the gutter that no alley cat would lower itself to drag in, like something they'd throw out of the DT ward at Bellevue along with the garbage, like something that ought to be dead and isn't. Well, Evelyn wouldn't have heard from me in a month or more. She'd have been waiting there at home alone, with the next door neighbors shaking their heads and feeling sorry for her out loud. That is before she got me to move to the outskirts, Where there weren't any next door neighbors. And then one day, the door would open and in I'd stumble, looking like what I said, into her home, which I kept so spotless and clean. And I had promised it would never happen again, and here I was swearing again, it's the last time. And I could see disgust having a battle in her eyes with love, but love always won out. She'd kiss me as though nothing happened, as though I'd just come home from a business trip. Well, Christ, can you imagine the guilty skunk she'd make me feel. If she only admitted once that she didn't believe anymore in her pipe dream that someday I'd behave, but she never would. Evelyn was stubborn as hell. Once she'd set her heart on anything, you couldn't shake her faith that it had to come true tomorrow. Well, it was the same old story, over and over, for years and years. Kept piling up inside her and inside me. God, can you picture all I made her suffer and all the guilt she made me feel and how I hated myself. If she only hadn't been so damned good. If she'd been the same kind of wife I was a husband. God, I'd even pray sometimes she'd, I'd say to her, "Go on, why don't you, Evelyn? "I wouldn't mind, it'd serve me right, I'd forgive you." Only I'd pretend I was kidding, yep, like I used to kid here about her being in the hay with the iceman. She'd have been so hurt if I'd said it seriously. She'd have thought I'd stopped loving her. Hey, I bet you think I'm kidding, huh? That no woman could have stood all she stood and still loved me so much, that it isn't human for any woman to be so pitying and forgiving. Well, I'm not kidding, and if you'd ever seen her, you'd know, it was written all over her face. Sweetness and love, pity and forgiveness. Wait. I'll show you, I always carry her picture. Yeah. Oh no. I'm forgettin' I tore it up afterwards. I didn't need it anymore. - Hickey, jeez. - I burned up Mother's picture, Larry. Her eyes followed me all the time. They seemed to be wishing I was dead. - It kept piling up, like I said, inside her and inside me. I got so I thought of it all the time. I got so I hated it more and more, thinking of all the wrong I'd done to the sweetest woman in the world who loved me so much. I even caught myself calling myself a lousy bastard every time I saw myself in the mirror. God, I felt such pity for her it drove me crazy. You wouldn't believe it, would you Larry? That a guy like me, who's knocked around so much, could feel such pity. And it got so I wound up every night with my face buried in her lap, bawling and begging for forgiveness. And of course, she'd always say, "It's all right, Teddy, "I know you won't ever again." Christ, Christ, I loved her so, but I began to hate that pipe dream. I began to to think I was going bughouse, 'cause sometimes I couldn't forgive her for forgiving me. I even caught myself hating her for making me hate myself so much. I tell you, there is a limit to the guilt you can feel and the forgiveness and pity you can take. You've got to begin blaming someone else too. And I got so sometimes when she'd kiss me, it was as though she did it on purpose to humiliate me, as though she spit in my face. And then I'd see how rotten of me that was, and it only made me hate myself all the more. You'd never believe it, would you Larry? That a good-natured, happy-go-lucky slob like me could hate so much? And as the time got nearer when I was due to come here for my drunk around Harry's birthday, I got nearly crazy. I kept swearing to her every night that this time I really wouldn't, until I'd made it a real final test to myself and to Evelyn. And of course she encouraged me and say, "I know you won't this time, Teddy. "You'll conquer it, dear and we'll be so happy, dear" Well, when she'd say that and kiss me, I'd believe it too. And then she'd go upstairs to bed, and I'd stay up alone because I didn't want to disturb her, tossing and rolling around. And I'd get so damned lonely, and I'd think how peaceful it was here, sitting around with the old gang, getting drunk and forgetting love, laughing and joking and singing and telling lies. And finally, I knew I'd have to come. And I knew if I came this time, it was the finish 'cause I'd never have the guts to go back and be forgiven again, and that would break poor Evelyn's heart because to her it would mean I didn't love her anymore. Well, that last night I'd driven myself nearly crazy trying to figure a way out for her. I went in the bedroom. I was gonna tell her it was the end, but I couldn't do it. She was sound asleep. And I thought to myself, oh God, if she never wakes up, she'll never know. And then it came to me, the one possible way out for her sake. I remembered I'd given her a gun for protection while I was away and it was in the bureau drawer. She'd never feel any pain, she'd never wake up from that dream. So-- - Give us a rest, who the hell cares? - Who cares? Who cares? (all groaning) - So, I killed her. - There's no use lying any more. You know the truth anyway. It was because I hated her. - And then I saw I'd always known that was the only possible way to give her peace and free her from the misery of loving me. And I saw it meant peace for me too, knowing she was at peace. And I felt as if a ton of guilt had been lifted off my mind. I remember I looked down at the bed and suddenly I had to laugh. I couldn't help it, and I knew Evelyn would forgive me. And I remember speaking to her, as if it was something I'd always wanted to say, "Well, you know what you can do "with your pipe dream now, you damned bitch." Oh! Oh, no, no, no, I never! - Yes, that's it, her and the old Movement pipe dream, eh Larry? - No, no, I never said, that's a lie! Why, I loved Evelyn more than anything in life. I must have gone insane to say that to her. (Hickey sobbing) Boys, boys! You're my old pals, you've known old Hickey for years. You know I'd never! Harry, Harry, you've known Hickey longer than anyone. You know I must have gone insane, don't you, Governor? - Who the hell cares? Insane? You mean you, you went really insane? - Yes. I couldn't have said that to her. I couldn't have laughed. - That's enough, Hickman. You know who we are. You're under arrest. Come along and spill your guts where we can get it on paper. - No, wait a minute, Officer. You owe me a break, I phoned and made it easy for you, didn't I? Just a few minutes. Harry, you know I couldn't have said that to Evelyn, unless-- - And you've been crazy ever since. Everything you've said and done here-- - Aw, now, Governor. Up to your old tricks again, eh? I know what you're driving at, but I'm not gonna let you get away with it. Yeah, I been crazy ever since. Everything I said and done here. You saw I was insane, didn't you, Governor? - Can it, I've had enough of your act. Save it for the jury. Now listen, you guys. Don't fall for his lies. He's getting a little foxy now, thinks he'll plead insanity, but he can't get away with it. - Hey, you dumb dick. You've got a crust trying to tell us about Hickey. Why, we've known him for years, every one of us noticed he was nutty when he first came here. If you saw all the crazy bull he was pulling about bringing us peace, like a bughouse preacher escaped from an asylum. If you'd seen all the crazy things he made us do. We only did them because well, well we thought he'd come out of it if we kidded him along and humored him. Ain't that right, fellers? - Yeah, that's it. - Yes, Harry. - That's it, Harry. - That's why. - A fine bunch of rats. Covering up for a dirty, cold-blooded murderer. - Is that so? Well, you heard the old story of when Saint Patrick drove the snakes out of Ireland, they swam to New York and joined the police force. (all chuckling) We can believe that now when we look at you, can't we, fellers? (all murmuring) - Sure you're right, Harry - Listen, you cockeyed old bum, for a plugged nickel I'd-- (Harry laughing) Come on, you. - Oh, I want to go, Officer. I should have phoned you from the house right afterwards. It was a waste of time my coming here. I've got to tell Evelyn. But I know she's forgiven me. She knows I was insane. You've got me all wrong, Officer. I want to go to the chair. - Crap. - Oh God, you're a dumb dick. Why, you bone head, I haven't got a single damned lying hope or pipe dream left. - Now get a move on. - All I want you to see is I was out of my mind afterwards, when I laughed. I was a raving rotten lunatic or I couldn't have said that to her. Why, I loved Evelyn better than anything on God's Earth I'd have killed myself-- - Don't worry, Hickey! They can't give you the chair! We'll all testify you was crazy, won't we, fellers? - Sure. - We're all gonna. - He's gone, the poor crazy son of a bitch. Bejeeb, I need a drink. Maybe it'll have the old kick in it, now that he's gone. - Yeah, Boss, maybe we can get drunk now. - May the chair bring him peace at last, the poor tortured bastard. - Yes, but he isn't the only one who needs peace, Larry. I can't feel sorry for him. He's lucky. He's through now. It's all decided for him. I wish it was decided for me. You're the only one who can understand how guilty I am because you know her and you know what I've done to her. You know I'm really much guiltier than he is. You know what I did is a much worse murder. Because she's dead and yet she has to live, for a while. But she can't live long in jail. She loves freedom too much, and I can't kid myself like Hickey, that she's at peace. As long as she lives, she'll never be able to forget what I've done to her. Not even in her sleep, she'll never have a second's peace. Jesus, Larry, can't you say something? And I'm not putting up any bluff now either that I was crazy afterwards when I laughed and I thought to myself, "You know what you can do with your freedom pipe dream now, "don't you, you damned old bitch." - Go. Get the hell out of life, before I choke it out of you! Go on, go up go up! (Don sighs) - Thanks, Larry. I just wanted to be sure. I can see now that that's the only possible way I can ever get free from her. I guess I've really known that all my life. - Then go up, for the love of God, you mad tortured bastard, for your own sake. - Jesus, Larry, that's kind. I knew you were the only one who could understand my side of it. - Hello, little Don, little monkey face. Don't be a fool, buy me a drink. - Sure, I will, Hugo. I will. Tomorrow. Beneath the willow trees. - Stupid fool! Hickey make you crazy too. I'm glad they take that crazy Hickey away to the asylum. He makes me have bad dreams, Larry He makes me tell lies about myself. He makes me want to spit on all I have ever dreamed. (Hugo laughs) I'm glad they take him to that asylum. I don't feel I'm dying anymore, Larry. He was selling death to me, that crazy salesman. I think I have a drink now. - Ah, fellers, I'm beginning to feel the old kick, or I'm a liar. It's putting life back in me. Bejeeb, if all I've lapped up hits me, I'll be paralyzed before I know it. (laughs) You know, it was Hickey kept it from, yeah, but sure, that's crazy, but he was crazy, and he'd got all of us bughouse too. Look at me pretending to start for a walk just to keep him quiet when I knew damned well it wasn't the right day for it. Sure, the sun was scorching and the streets were full of automobiles. You know, I could feel myself getting sunstroke, and an automobile damn nearly ran over me. Ask Rocky here, he seen it, now didn't you, Rocky? - What's that, Boss? Heh, gee, all that booze I've mopped up is beginning to get me. (laughs) The automobile, Boss? Sure, I seen it. Just missed ya. I thought you was a goner. On the word of a honest bartender. Ho, ho, ho, ho, aw you're a bartender, all right. Nobody can say different to that. But don't pull that honest junk. You and Chuck should have cards in the Burglars' Union. (all laughing) Ah, isn't it? Isn't it grand to hear laughter here once again. You know, all the time that bas, poor old Hickey was here, you know I didn't have the heart. So, fellers, it's on the house. To Hickey! Good luck to him in Matteawan, bottoms up. - Here, here! - Matteawan! - Yeah! - Why don't he? - Why don't he what? Don't be a fool, Hickey's gone, he was crazy. Here, have a drink. What's matter, Larry? You look funny. What you listen to out in the backyard? - Well, I thank God me and Chuck did all we could to humor that poor nut. Ooh, imagine us goin' off like we really was gonna get married. We ain't even picked out a farm yet. - Sure thing, baby. And we kidded him we was serious. - I may say I detected his condition almost at once. All that nonsense about tomorrow, for example. He had the fixed idea of the insane. It only makes them worse to cross them. - Same with me, Jimmy. (laughing) Only I spent the day in the park. I wasn't damned fool enough to-- - Picture my predicament if I had gone to the Consulate. Well, that pal of mine there is a humorous blighter. He would have found me a job out of pure spite. (all laughing) So, I strolled about and finally came to roost in the park. And who should I find on a neighboring bench but my old battlefield companion, the Boer that walks like a man who, if the British Government had taken my advice, would have been removed from his fetid kraal on the veldt straight to the baboon's cage at the London Zoo, and little children would now be asking their nurses, "Tell me, Nana, is that the Boer General, "the one with the blue behind?" (all laughing) No offense meant, Piet, old chap, what? - No offense taken, you lousy Limey. You know, about a job, I feel just like Cecil. - What's matter, Larry? You look scared. What you listen to out there? - No, sir, I wasn't fool enough to get in no crap game. Not while Hickey was around. Crazy people put a jinx on you. - I know you saw how it, Ed. Oh, it's no good trying to tell a crazy man it ain't the right time. You know how it is about getting reinstated. - Aw, sure, Mac. Same way with the circus. You know, the boys are telling me the rubes are wasting all their money buying food. Times was never so bad. I was never one to cheat for chicken feed, huh? (Ed and Pat laughing) - I think I'm getting cockeyed. I think youse are all cockeyed. (all laughing) Come on, drink up, boys! - Maddening. Why you keep your eyes shut? You look dead. What you listen to out in the backyard? You crazy fool. You was crazy like Hickey. You give me the bad dreams too. - Hello, there, Hugo! Welcome to the party! - [Harry] Yes, Hugo, Hugo. Sit down, have a drink, have 10 drinks! (all laughing) - Hello, little Harry! Hello, nice funny little monkey faces! Rotten damned bourgeois! Soon comes the Day of Judgment. (all chuckling) Give me 10 drinks, Harry! Don't be a fool! - [Margie] Gangway for two good whores. - Yeah, we wanna drink, quick. - Yeah, shake the lead outta your pants, pimp. How about a little service? - Well, look who's here! Hello there, sweethearts. Gee, I was beginning to worry about ya, honest. - What is this a gag? - Oh, girls, girls, come in. I'm delighted to see you, sit down, have a drink. - Hey, what's come off here, huh? - Where's that louse, Hickey? - The cops got him. He'd gone crazy and croaked his wife. He'll get Matteawan. He ain't responsible. What he pulled don't mean a thing. So, forget that whore stuff, see? I'll knock the block off anyone that calls you whores. I'll fill the bastard full of lead. You're tarts, so what the hell of it? You're as good as anyone, see? So, forget it, see? - Aw, that's our little bartender. - Yeah, he's a cute little Guinea, isn't he? - Ooh, and is he stinko. - Stinko is right. But he ain't got nothin' on us, huh? Wow, did we have a time in Coney. - The only way out for him. For the peace of all concerned, as Hickey says. Damn his yellow soul, if he doesn't soon, I'll go up and throw him off like a dog with its guts ripped out you'd put out of misery. (body thumps) - Hey, hey, what's that? - [Rocky] Aw, nothin', somethin' fell off the fire escape. A mattress, I'll bet. Some of these bums have been sleepin' on the fire escapes. - [Harry] They'd better cut that out now, this is no fresh air cure. (all laughing) Mattresses cost money. - [Ed] Aw, now stop crabbing up the party, Harry. Let's drink up, huh? - Poor devil. God rest his soul in peace. Ah, the damned pity again, the wrong kind, as Hickey says. There's no hope for me. I'll never be a success in the grandstand or anywhere else. Life is too much for me. I'll be a weak fool looking with pity at the two sides of everything until the day I die. And may that day come soon. Be damned, I'm the only real convert to death that Hickey's made here. From the bottom of my coward's heart I mean that now. - Larry, what you doing over there by yourself? Come on, come and get paralyzed! (all cheering) Fellas, I feel like singing. Let's all sing! ♪ Sing ♪ ♪ La da da da da da ♪ ♪ Da da da da da ♪ ♪ Ah da da oh oh ♪ - [Hugo] Capitalist swine! Stupid, bourgeois monkey faces! The days grow hot, O Babylon! - [All] 'Tis cool beneath thy willow trees! (all laughing) (melancholy music) (dramatic music) (bell ringing)
