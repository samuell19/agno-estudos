Ladies and gentlemen, good morning, this is Joe Daniels from the deck of the Admiralty Collins, in the Pacific Ocean. The space capsule is estimated will enter the stratosphere... And I will continue, when the time comes... Frank, can you hear me in the control center? Can you hear me? The helicopter is ready for the rest of the operation. - Are you getting anything? - We have it on the screen now! Joe, how are the Dodgers doing? And how would I know, we have work to do! Well, don't bite! Now let's look inside the capsule. Okay, that's fine. Synchronise the archive video with the audio, to make it look like a live shot! 00:01:18.253 Have the video ready just in case. If something happens, that's what we'll show! - You got it, Sam? - Yeah, boss! - Now give me the studio. - Connecting to studio... The camera three... Joe, I'm starting to worry...

I'm gonna be late. Roy, step on the gas, please. Don't worry... We'll be on time. As the capsule will enter into the Earth's atmosphere, the dredging is planned at 09:45, Winter Pacific Time. The weather conditions in the area of in the area of the stranding are ideal. The Navy will recover the capsule, as soon as it hits the area. Temperature above normal. ALIEN 2: THE TERRA FIRMA ON EARTH - We were getting worried. - Sorry I'm late. All's well that ends well. There is no time to rehearse. Sit there. - You ready, Jack? - All ready! Just give me a second, with the transmitter. - Did you bring pictures of the caves? - Sure, I have them here. Bring them to the screen immediately. Mary, final touches. Honey, I've already taken care of it. It's okay, I have tissues. in my bag. Let me get this off the set. - Your jacket, miss. - Yes, of course. - I'm ready. - So am I. So we are ready, then. - Hey, uh... - Hello, Roy. Joe, give me a signal when you have to when we have to show the ship again. So that we don't have a holiday. We are ready. Show the pictures of the caves. Camera one, go! We are in the air. Hello. While we wait for the the space capsule to dock we will learn more about the unknown underground world. The wonderful world of caves, of stalagmites and stalactites. Are you aware that the space agency spends millions of dollars every year... to explore the distant the far reaches of our solar system. What you don't know is that dedicated researchers, they also explore the Earth's subsoil. Today, we have with us, the famous speleologist, which is the one that explores the caves, Miss Thelma Joyce. Hello! Tell me, what motivated an attractive a woman like you to become a caveman? First of all, there is no traffic congestion down there. On your last mission, what did you discover? We have made many important discoveries. I think the most important discovery was a cave in Colorado. The enchanting cave you see in the picture. It is estimated to be 2 million years old. Two million years old! A very old cave indeed! Yeah... it took us two weeks to explore it. It was a difficult descent! - And you explored it on your own? - No, we're a team. Unfortunately, the rest of us are struggling bowling match right now! - Then say hello to them! - Hello... How many metres below the surface of the sea is the cave? Yes, how many meters below the surface of the sea is the cave? - What the hell happened to her? - Zoom in on camera 2. Ladies and gentlemen, we will be back shortly. Please stay tuned. Here is an important message from the sponsor of our show. Stop the download. No, ads. Okay, Don, you're off the air. Thelma... come with me. The cameramen are to stay in their seats. We'll be on the air soon. Jeff, don't move it! And you, Don, don't go far! - Thelma... what's wrong with you? - The same thing happened to me again. Show the astronauts. At what frequency? I told you to prepare the archival video long ago! Everyone will think it's a lie, you idiots! - What the hell is going on? - I don't know... it's just happening... Get her bag! - You want a drink? - No, thank you. I feel better already. Do you want to continue? Joe... what do you say we keep going? I'm sorry, but we don't have time. Thelma is telepathic. If something happens, he feels it, even from a distance. - Feeling better now? - Yes. I'm sorry, Mr. Raymond. - Be careful. Goodbye! - Okay. Okay. Bye. Bye. - Hello, Roy. - Thank you. All mobile units. You are ready to go live? Let's go! Stay in the image of the parachute until it opens. That's it guys! We're starting the rescue and recovery operation. Peter! Peter! Peter! I'm coming, to you! Thank you, Manny. I'll call you later. - Hello, Thelma. - Hey, Thelma. Are you okay? Know that you create these monsters that scare you. - Then what should I do? - Nothing... You have to learn to control them. Like all of us. You obliged us... Without, however, paying you. Just a moment to put on my boots. Where's your favorite? He's waiting for me in the car. Does that help you at all? Not really, huh? Nor does he can't kill the monsters. Look, you're not the only one with problems. You have to learn to live with them! Yes, I know... If it happens again, what should I do? I'm late, honey. I have to go, I'm sorry. These fears have taken over you, all of a sudden. These monsters that you feel surrounding you, might be real, maybe not... Either way, real or imagined, they will be with you all your life. Mom, look what I found! What is it? A blue stone... She's very beautiful, Tony. Hey, brother! Thelma, I saw you on TV. What happened to you? Nothing. - Where are our friends? - What did you say? Our friends... where are they? There, down there! Thank you... I see them. Hello, Thelma. How are the your stalactites? Are they growing? Like crazy! In two thousand years they will have grown a meter. - Are you two still bullying each other? - Jealous? That's not much to say! What's going on here? Ron misses and the game is over. You never know... - Watch and learn. - Let me laugh. - Try this. - Thank you. - Double or nothing? - A hundred bucks, go? Everybody get off Ten dollars. Thelma? Thelma? $100. Now, back off! Come on, give me my share! Here, take it. What do I have left? Nothing... - Ron, how do you do it every time? - Because I'm crazy! Is it far to the cave, Cliff? About 60 kilometers. What do you care? Are you gonna walk? - You guys all right? - Yeah. - I have a sore throat, Doctor... - I think I have claustrophobia too. We'll find you a particularly large cave! Stop, please, a for a moment at Hummel's store. Why? I want to get something. - Don't be late, okay? - Yeah, I won't be late. I'm going to get some fresh air. - Are you feeling bad, darling? - No, I just need some air. Mel? Where are you? Hi! Hi, Bert. What can I do for you? The candles I ordered... They must have arrived. Sure, here it is. Direct from Italy. - Oh, great! How much? - Twenty dollars. Why so expensive? When the new Pope is elected, the prices go up. They ran out of candles. Here... - You want something else? - No, thank you. - How's your new book going? - Two thousand pages to go. No! - Thelma?! - What do you want? What do you want? Thelma! Come on, let's go! Hurry up! Come on, move it. What the hell is wrong with you? Everybody's waiting for you! Let's go. Are you okay? I don't know... Let's go. Lucy! Lucy! Lucy, where are you? Lucy, it's time to go home! Lucy! Come on, Lucy! Lucy! Lucy, where are you?! Lucy! Lucy! Lucy! Lucy! What... what happened? What is it, my heart? Lucy, why are you crying? Come on, darling. Let's go home. When they opened the capsule, there was no inside, no sign of the two astronauts. Forty minutes ago, they had reported that all was well! You want some? - You need something? - Everything! We need everything, Maria Consuelo. That is, everything we usually take! Will you be exploring a new cave today? No, the one we started last week, but we didn't have time to finish. It's huge! Wait a minute! We're in! Hurry up, girls. Hurry up, I'm going to burst! Hang on! Find a fire hydrant. You're very rude, Bert. - Okay, guys... we're leaving. - Are we good on supplies? Okay, I took care of everything. Don't worry. Jill, can I sit up front? I get nauseous. Here we go again. What do you mean? Wait! Where are you going? Are you going to leave me here? Come on, come on. So, did you finally find the hydrant? We're doing a little humor? Let's go, now. - But look what I found! - Let me see! Get your hands off me! I brought it for you. Isn't it a jewel? - Beautiful! - I knew you'd like it. - Where did you get it? - Where did I get it? - That's where people find things. - Joy in the thing, for a stone! Bert is a writer. He's going to write a book about it. If you ask me, it's muff. Listen to the jealous man! How two astronauts disappeared inside from a sealed capsule? You heard it too! Yes, but I don't believe it. Maybe the Russians found someone a way to empty the capsule. Oh, come on! To steal our astronauts? Why? It's probably some kind of communication trick. Sure! Isn't that what they always do? Here's the entrance. You go in first, Jill. Attention! Here we are. Up to here we had the last time. - How deep do you think it is? - About 50 yards? - I say more like... - Why don't you give me your flashlight? Let's get the ropes ready. Ron, make sure the equipment is insured. Burt! Bert? They are all getting ready to go to bed. Come on, come on. A tent must be set up. Big deal! Should I do it? I'm writing now. Well... Why do you always write by candlelight? Why candlelight is sweet and adds romance. It inspires me. They have another advantage. And what is that? They are extremely... convenient. Conveniently? Because what I write is for the garbage and I burn it in a minute! - Good system, huh? - Yes! What's going on? I wish I knew. Call me paranoid, but I'm so lonely. Do you think there are "monsters" in all of us? You can't destroy every every moment this way, Thelma. If you keep this up, you're gonna go crazy. You'll end up in an asylum. Come here. Well, guys... what's the schedule? Exploration, in groups. We'll meet here in two hours. - Done. - I'll go with you. - Did you get the camera? - Yes. Give me the lantern, Bill. Beautiful sight! Fantastic! Cliff, come here. - Ron, do you have Polaroid? - You betcha! Isn't it wonderful? Well, get on. It's amazing! Let's go. Bill! Look at that! Here! Jill, don't be late. That looks like a camel, guys! It is true. Come on, Bedouins! Charge! Ron, let's take a picture! How did it come out? There is a lot of light. How is it possible to have so much light down here? Come on, try again. Smile, please. Hold still! Why? What's going on? The stone is moving. - What are you talking about? - The stone is moving! Roy! Bill! Where are you? This is Thelma. Something's happened! Let's go! Please! Somebody! Roy! Bill! Answer me, please! Where are you? Roy, where are you? Answer me! We're coming, right away! Here! - What happened? - What's the problem? It's terrible! The stone Bert brought. Where's Jill? He fell. What do you mean? Where is it? I don't know! Her face disappeared! I ran away! Ron, Maureen, get the stretcher. Cliff, the first aid kit. Bert, the sonar. Bill, the ropes. Hurry up! Hurry up, we might save her. It's okay, baby. Calm down. Don't worry, we'll find her. Do you remember where you were? Yes. We will try to follow your course. Agreed? Can you make it? Yeah, I... She's still alive. Lower the stretcher! Set up the lifting mechanism. Done! Bring the stretcher. Is it bad? Her face is intact. Attention to movement. Good thing she was wearing her helmet. It protected her. It looks good, but it may have broken something. He needs a doctor. Get down! Come and help. You, stay here. I'll go down. No! Do not move it. Do you have it insured? Let's hope he hasn't some internal bleeding. Keep her steady. I'm going to hook up the stretcher. Okay, well... Ron, lock it up tight! We are ready. Secure the other side as well. Unbelievable! I saw her earlier, I swear to you. Her face was covered in blood. It's not possible... How are you doing? Are you ready? - Yeah, you? - Yeah, hook it up. Okay. Go now! - Everything okay? - Yes, you can come up. If you don't want to stay down there, keep a good grip on the rope. We're going up. Is there a problem with the lift system. All right, I'll pull the ropes manually. Let's get out of here! Stop! As soon as the panic stops, how do we get to the surface? However, not from there. We have to find another way out. Without the ropes, what do we do? Soon we won't have any oxygen. Calm down! We have a chance. We'll use the sonar. If we use it correctly we will find our way back. I left it in my sleeping bag. Oh, my God! There's no way out! Wait for me here. - Where are you going? Are you crazy? - I left it there. - Let go of me! - No, Bert, no! Calm down, it's me! - He did it! - Here. Burt and Maureen, go south. Okay. Roy and Thelma, west to the subway river. Me and Phil will head north. Let's check the sonar first. Hurry up, I can't stand it here any longer. They work fine. - And mine. - Thank God. - Good. - Let's not waste time. Go ahead, see you later. - Thelma? - Yes. - Looks like I found a passageway. - Good, because there's nothing here. Come on up. - Let me help you. - It's okay. This must be the bank of a of an underground river many years ago. If so, we should it must lead to the sea. But the ocean is 500 kilometres away. With any luck we'll find a way to the surface. - I hope so. - Either way, we have no choice. I wish I knew what was going on. Forget it and let's find a way out. But how did they disappear the astronauts, Roy? I wish I knew. Do you think there's a connection to the stone? - It's all so strange. - Do you think it exists? It looked like ore that suddenly came to life. Poor Jill. What probably saved you was that he sensed you had a strong mind. Who knows? Maybe it has something to do with with all those monsters you've been seeing. Roy... - I'm afraid, Roy... - Calm down, now. It was like... Maybe he's trying to contact you, so he didn't hurt you. What a strange fog. We are approaching the cave of the winds. We'd better get moving, Maureen. At one time it must have been a large underground lake. Come on, we'll make it. The signal is constantly changing. Look, something's going on. Come on, let's go. - Is it okay? - The antenna's broken. Oh my God, now what do we do? Oh, no! Come on, Maureen. We're not coming back yet. - Who is it? - It's us. - Roy and Thelma? - Yes. - Did you find something? - Maybe there's a way out of there. - What about you? - Nothing. - Bert and Maureen? - We've lost contact with them. - Let's go find them. - Right, let's go. Burt, there's a passage here. So it seems. I'll go check it out. You check the other side. Okay. Maureen! Maureen! My leg! - Let me see it! - Take it easy! It does not appear to be broken. Try to get up. I can't drop my weight. Don't worry, we'll stop to rest. Wait a minute. I'll try to walk. Wait a minute. You stay here and I'll go to find Bert and Maureen. Help me. Leave him here. Let's keep in touch through the radios. Everything will be fine. And if you can't find them? Then I'll come back and we'll see what we're going to do together. I'll find them. - Thelma, can you hear me? - Yes, Cliff. I think I found a way out. In the cave of the winds... No, Cliff, don't go! It's a strange feeling being here all alone. - You'd better get back. - Don't worry. Thelma? Thelma, can you hear me? Answer me! Cliff! Answer me! Answer me! To hell! Cliff. Thelma, what do you see? Concentrate. Concentrate on Cliff. Drive him! I can't. A higher power is blocking me. Try! Concentrate. Answer me! Come in, Cliff. Cliff! It's stationary. He's waiting. It's above your head! There's something there! - It's Cliff! - Stop it! It's not Cliff. Who are you? You're not Cliff. Answer me. Who are you? You're not Cliff! You're not! You're not! No! Come on. We'll get off this way. Let's go! This is where we came from. - Help me! - Yes, come on. Let's go! Stop it! - Look, a police car. - Thank God. Anybody here? That's very strange... And now, what do we do? It must be around here somewhere. Anybody here? Wait a minute. I'll use the radio. Hello, can anyone hear me? It's dead. Let's go to town. Consuelo! Consuelo! Consuelo! Anybody here? Consuelo! What the hell is going on? Where has everyone gone? - Let's try the phone. - Good idea. - You got change? - Yes. Hello? Hello? Operator? - Operator? - No answer? Hello? Hello? Nothing, the line is dead. We're wasting our time, let's go. Greg! Joe! The engines are running. It's got to be here somewhere. Greg! I'm gonna take a look around. Thelma! Roy... no! Roy! Roy! Help! Help me, please! Answer me! Answer me! Answer me! ...Now, it can infect you too... Interpretation of audio dialogues: ♪ I don't know what to do ♪
