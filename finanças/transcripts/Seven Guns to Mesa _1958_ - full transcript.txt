Seven Guns to Mesa (1958) There's water already there, guys. Feel free. We will leave after watering the horses. Water. I get sick just thinking about it. Does anyone want a sip? George, as always, it's just you and me. What a beautiful sign. Even in death it is beautiful. Should we pay our condolences? George, say hello to a fallen soldier. Turn around and walk. Come on, drunk. Walk. Let's go. Walking. Let's go. Okay, guys. We better get back. I thought I said this was a ghost town. I was told that it emptied after the gold rush in 49. I don't know what's going on, but I will report this to the next city sheriff. You won't do any of that, sir. If this is private property, I didn't know. We just stopped to get water. We were ready to go, so... We will leave if the weapons are lowered. That beautiful body of yours won't go anywhere before I tell you. You don't have to talk to a lady like that. If this is a robbery, why don't you take our money and let us go? You talk too much. Calm down, boy, before I open a hole in you. We will set out on that stage very politely. So no one will be hurt... For a while. You heard Papa. Let's go. Just because you look like a pig, you don't have to act like one. You killed George. You dirty killer! Now, why did you do that? You know it's not right to hit an old man. He's crazy. He called George's bottle and acted like he was human. He was more human than you. I had an understanding that you don't have. My dad was like you, only he called your bottle old Jeff. When he was drunk, he was the best dad ever. What is your name? Ben Avery. Nice to meet you, Ben. If you're like my father, you have another George on the stage. -There is not? -Yes. Go get it. Bring Bear here. You keep a lookout. Well, look what we have here. Hey, Bear? Papa wants to talk to you. Papa? Guys, watch the stage. You can not do that. That diligence belongs to... Me, sir. Wasn't that what you had in mind? Bear. Hey, Papa? Papa, there's a rider half a mile, in this direction. -Simmons, take the staff to the saloon and keep them quiet. Marsh, take the horses to the barn. Go back to the rock, Crandall. Come with me. Get your luggage and walk. Let's go! Let's go. Walking. Let's go. -It is clean. -Wow, you are weird. Why aren't you armed to protect your saddlebag? I figured I would never find someone brave enough to take it from me. You are brave. Very foolish. Didn't you know that there are bandits in these parts? There are bandits everywhere. I have $ 200 and some food. If you want, it's yours. I just want to make my way to San Francisco. Isn't he generous? It is a pity for a gentleman like you not to be able to visit that bustling city. But I don't think it would fit in anyway. With all those profiteers and sinful women around? Thank you for the advice. I will try to avoid them. So, if you'll excuse me... I see you listen well, too. So, listen carefully. I say to enter this saloon. What do you say? Well, it's obvious that they won't be here today. Maybe tomorrow. Tomorrow we will need all possible weapons, right? Yes. Do you have anything in mind? Certainly. With Duncan and Simmons watching the staff in the saloon, we will only have 5 men. I believe that this work will need 7 men, and that is what we will have. And who will watch over them? It won't be necessary, because they will be dead. -Are you going to kill them in cold blood? -Is there a better way? Do not. But it doesn't seem right to kill them for no reason. And what group are we waiting for? Are you going to shake their hand? You know me better than that. I will kill as many of them as possible. And I have good reason for that. So, let me give you a good reason to get rid of the people in the saloon. They can describe us perfectly. And there are many lawmen on the road that we will take. We will swing at the end of a rope before we travel 50 miles. I'm not afraid to die. But thinking about dying rich makes me sick. Let's go. Get out of here. I do not know about that. - We'll start here. -Everything makes sense, except for this marking across the Mexican border. -Maybe it's water. -No, this is not a water mark. Back! Didn't you believe me, boy? I told you I would make a hole for you if you didn't calm down. Now, get up and calm down. If I were hurt, you would tear a piece that beautiful dress for me? I'm talking with you. Now, your... I will kill you slowly. Stop this. You deserved. You have no right to slap a lady. -I think not. -Hey, I'm bleeding a lot! Naturally. You bleed when you are shot. I am disappointed in you. What did you do when that happened? Did they count money? That boy should be dead. What good is it to clean your weapons if you don't use them at the right time? And you two should be by my side. I hope you will not disappoint me when the time comes. Time to arrive? -Should I tell him, boys? -For what? Because I am proud of my plan and I think he will enjoy listening. - It looks like a robbery. -Don't spoil the fun. -You want me to tell you, don't you? -I'm listening. 6 days ago, a shipment of gold left Carson City in this direction. Since this is the only water well in 50 miles, they will have to visit us. And the trail below Blacksman is perfect for an ambush. That's right. They will not know what hit them. And that is merciful, isn't it? Why did you arrest us? We can't stop him to steal the caravan. Certainly not. But on the other hand, we cannot stop them from giving our descriptions to the law. You understand my problem, don't you? Listen, sir. I'm a rich man. If you give me a horse and let me go, I'll give you $ 10,000. - Do you have $ 10,000 with you? -No, but I'll send it to you. I give my word. Any man who has $ 10,000 has no say. Will you say that about us when we get rich? Of course yes. You suck, Papa. You are not worth a penny, like the rest of us. I feel bad about you, Ben. Why suffer? Why don't you let me go? I can't trust you now that you broke that bottle. You shouldn't have done that. I had a weakness for you. Now, you're like the rest. Then they will do just one thing... -You'll kill us. -Well, wouldn't you do that? That's all we can do. I didn't ask you to come here. You speak as if I were to blame. And that is not fair, sir. After taking the gold, will you go to Mexico? That is the plan. But don't be scared, you will live until the shipment of gold appears. So... Well, it's life. Guys, I think it would be nice if I gave them a little privacy. Let's go. In return, know that we will be watching wherever you go. You understood me, didn't you? Are you crazy, you fool? Cut another piece of the dress. Let's put it on the counter. Help me. I didn't know if he could take it. That way is easier for him, and for me. Let's go. He's bleeding a lot. Clean faster. I can not see. Maybe the driver would better help me if he can't. Do not worry about me. I've seen worse. You seem at peace with the world. I don't feel that way. But it is better than acting with an alley cat. How did you know what I was going to do? I've been around men long enough to know what they will do before they think about it. -This is bad. -In my work it came in handy. It is not fair to attack someone without giving them a chance. You're right. You are a good teacher. I think he's the kind of man who could teach a woman what not to do. This is very important. I know now. The saddest part is taking care of other people's problems while we drown in ours. I was drowning when someone threw me a rope. I thought you were safe and here I am, back in the water. People shouldn't make plans. I was on my way to get married. I used all the tricks to achieve this. I thought I could do it, but I will never arrive. I am happy with that. Do you know why? A smart man never marries the past. He's interested in the future. I would like to meet the man who does not like fresh flowers. If you manage to get out of this, will you still find him? No, I'm going home. I'll start over again. So... Maybe a man will kiss me without thinking about what he will receive, but... Just because... I liked you. If we had more time, I might like you very much. Lucky for you we didn't have it. Did you miss something? It's good out here, isn't it? I love the cold desert breeze. What do you think about getting another blanket for the lady? -Where will we get this? -I thought you could give me yours. See how a man can go wrong? May this serve as a lesson for you. Don't think for others. Go back inside. -I want to talk to you. - Pope doesn't want to talk to anyone. Now, go away. You don't get scared easy, do you? Come tell me what you have in mind. And give me this knife. Remember those crosses on your map? -Curious? -Not much. You should be. Why this will end you and your boys. Watch out for him, Papa. He wants something. I really want. Save you all. Isn't that kind? But, why would a stranger do this for us? To save them, I am forced to help them. What makes you think we need help? From the way he looked at the map. You don't know the place where are you going. For a smart man, you faltered. You insulted me, sir. It is better to make sure you speak with facts, and be quick. -Explode his head, Papa. -I'll do that if it doesn't make sense. I'll start with the crosses. They symbolize one of the most rugged mountains in those parts. There is no way to go over it, but there is a way to get past them. And it's not on your map. That makes sense. Proceed. Your horses will carry a lot of gold. Which means they have to walk. This will make you thirsty. There is little water. I can see them fighting each other over what little is left. And I don't need to tell you that there is nothing more dangerous than a thirsty man. Why are we listening to you? Look at those clothes. What does he know about that part of the country? Shut up. A man is more than his clothes. Mr. Trey, I believe you. From the beginning, I knew you were special. You would have to be to walk unarmed. I'm not doubting you. But how do you know so much about that part of Mexico? I worked with the circus. We travel to all border cities. See? I knew he was special. I love the circus. I almost ran away with one, but my dad caught me. What were you doing at the circus? There was a problem, huh? We feel your pain. Me and my boys understand. Now, tell me more. I will take you to Mexico. In return, I want you to free my friends... After the theft. Well, what do you say, guys? I am in favor of that. -What they say? -You know more than that. I'm not going anywhere with him! -How do we know you tell the truth? -You won't know. I say that the Pope is the boss and he has to decide. Thank you, boy. Agreement closed. Right. Let's get one thing straight. They will be released and then we will move on. I give my word of honor. Papa, you are crazy to make a deal with him. Him and his fancy clothes. I do not like him. I don't understand you, Papa. You said that... I know what I said. I said they would hand us over to the first lawman they found. That's why we will get rid of everyone except Mr. Trey. And we'll kill him as soon as he gets us where we want to go. -Now, what are you complaining about? -Papa, you raised your right hand. Oh, that. I can't understand why some people seem to think that you tell the truth when you raise your right hand and give your word. Besides, I'm left-handed. Stand up. They are sleeping at the entrance. Let's go. You promised. Look. I do not know. Why would we risk it? Trey was promised to release us. Sure. But what about him? Do you think it's fair to let him die for us? You know what they'll do to him after they cross the border. It's too risky. I would go alone if I knew the way to the next city. Look, you said we could be back with help in 4 hours. You know, there will be a big reward if we save the gold shipment. He's all yours. I won't have a penny. Okay, but remember, I'll take everything. Well, take off your hats, guys. Will anyone say anything about the deceased? May the Lord have mercy on your miserable soul... For taking the lives of two innocent men. I also have something to say. It is not for them. And to you. May it rot in purgatory for its evil sins. And if I deserve anything decent, it will be to live long enough to see you and your vultures die. Start cursing us and I will kill you right here. No, talking like that will only get you to hell. Don't you know it is a sin to speak like that before these graves? I'm sorry, Papa. Is that you. You make the world stink when you're sober. You are just like my father! Now, let's stop attacking ourselves and talk about important things. As you know the place, I want you to make a list of the special supplies you think we will need on our trip. -How long do you think it will take? -I won't take you anywhere. - Our agreement is canceled. -What you mean? I agreed to help you in return for the lives of 5 people. I'm only seeing three. You have broken your promise and it frees me from my obligation. You want me to taste it, don't you? What do you say, boy? If you don't care about your life, what about your friends? Three is better than none. Living or dying is the same for me. So you only need to worry about two. -One, I'm with Ben. -I admit that I want to live, but if the lady can face a gun, so can I. You are in trouble, sir. Yes, that's what it looks like, isn't it? Bear, why don't you take the lady to the barn and see if you can convince Mr. Trey to help us? Don't just stand there, boy. Take her. Do not. -Got something to say? -I'll go with you. Come back here, Bear. I knew I would change my mind. You disgust me. Always take off your hat when a lady passes by. And for you to remain acting like a gentleman, we'll take you on our trip. And your job will be to watch over her in case Mr. Trey changes his mind. Come on. Let's leave the dead alone. Rest in peace, my friends. See something? -There's nothing on the horizon. -Maybe they won't come. They will come, yes. I even heard the cavalry soldiers in the saloon. Do you think I spent whiskey for nothing? -Why are they taking so long? -Look, boy. I'm not in charge of the caravan. They may have been stuck in the stream. Time seems closed down there. I also don't like to wait, but if we have to do that, we better do it with a smile, huh? Wow. You have a way with words. When we are restless, you always calm us down. It is the general's job to keep the soldiers happy. Keep an eye out, guys. The general will take a nap. And you will dream of all that gold and how we will spend it in Mexico. You have luck. No woman has ever washed my shirt except my mother. If you're kind to the right woman, she'll wash 100 shirts for you. I tried that. He took my shirt, my pants with all the money and I never saw them again. Traitor. You know, I feel your pain. -Do you have to sit close like that? -It's cool to hear. Go ahead and talk, I won't get involved. I expected this from Bear, but you surprise me. Don't compare me to Bear. -I was well created. -Why don't you show it? Look. I can't leave you alone. Papa would beat me up. We are not asking you to leave us alone. We're just asking you not to sit too close. I can only go this far. Already help? Thank you. I have seen many angry men. But I've never seen anyone face a gun like you. I'm not angry. Believe me when I say. Don't mess with me. Why? I am fighting a battle that I will not win. If you're talking about the past, I don't lose to anyone... -Day after day. -Did you ever kill a man? -Not. -Well, I killed it. Do you want to talk about it? I worked in the circus as a sniper. Bill was my target. We got along well until he got married. He chose the wrong woman, she looked at everyone. He started drinking. I should have fired you there, but our act was so well-liked that I started to roll. It was not easy to find someone for that kind of work. The next night, she ran away with another man. I did not know. Bill must have gone crazy. He moved to my line of fire. I haven't touched a gun since. I can not. Hey, this is a sad story. It reminded me of the first man I killed. He also stood in front of my gun. Do you know what I should have done? Killed another one next. Now you're in trouble. You can't shoot or go back. This is complicated. Why martyr yourself? I only blame one person, the wife. Not you. I could have fired you. He would still be alive. And I would be a princess if my mother were a queen. You talk a lot, but all you do is suffer. You have a disease. You like to torment yourself. When you kissed me last night, you cleared 10 years of hate. I think I was wrong. Just one more kiss on the girl with the beautiful dress. Forgive me for expecting you to be a different man. Papa wants to see you. He's on the rock. You are wasting time. It will never change. But I can. I will become rich soon. I'll buy bracelets with diamonds. And I'll put them on you. What do you say? If I said what I want, you would die inside. Why don't you get out of here and stop spoiling the fresh air? -Go rest. -Okay, Papa. Here he is, Papa. I will take care of the horses. Don't just stand there, boy. Go up and join me. I don't like people standing next to me. Sit down. Did you bring the list? Are you upset. How long will you hold that grudge? As long as I'm alive. You are a difficult man. Why don't you act like me? I act according to what happens. Act really. Taking what you can. I know what's bothering you. That girl. Leave it here and I'll do whatever you want. Do you want me to do you a favor? I do no favors for anyone. Unless they do one for me, and you did nothing. No one has ever done anything for me. When they do something, I am the first to express my thanks. Wait. I hate them. Nothing disgusts me more than a snake. Why do they have to exist? What difference do they make? What difference do you make? Keep talking like that and I'll kill you. Want to try again? I did not try. If you tried, you would be dead. I thought you were going to throw that stone at me. Why did it? I wouldn't do it for you. You want me to be indebted to you, don't you? I wasn't thinking about anything. I saw a snake and a man in danger. Well, sir, you deserve the favor you asked for. The girl will be released. I heard a shot. Is something wrong, Papa? There's nothing wrong. I just shot a snake. Not! Get out of the way, Papa. I will kill you. - Calm down, Bear. -That's none of your business, Papa. -Get out of the way. - It's my business, yes. Stop it or I'll kill you. We need Trey. I'll blow his head off the first chance I get. Why don't you hit him over the head instead of killing him? So you can have fun and we’ll keep you alive. What it says? I prefer to feed the vultures with it. It looks like there's a problem, boy. What it says? No, he will kill you. Wait a minute. This is no place for a fight. The sand will fall into your eyes. Let's go. Walking. Caution! Oh, my leg! Not! Oh, my leg! My leg is broken. -Look at his leg, guys. -My leg. -It's really broken, Papa. - Just below the knee. You can feel the bone through his pants. Papa. Papa, you have to help me. You have to do something for me. -You have to help me. -Of course, boy. Why are you looking at me like that? When a horse breaks its leg, you sacrifice it, don't you? It was the least I could do for a friend in pain. Now, cheer up. With Bear's death, that means more gold for all of us. I'm sure it will ease your grief. Dig a nice pit for him. I'm going to eat I'm hungry. Get it here. Come back sniffing whiskey and blow your head off. -What's wrong with a dose? -Nothing, except that a dose it is an invitation to another. Soon, everyone in the city will know that we are waiting for gold. I can handle drinking as well as anyone. That was what the cavalry soldiers thought. But they did not stop talking about the gold they would protect. Now, I want you to take the back path. They don't need to know that we have two men less. I think we'll be back tomorrow morning. I think they'll be back before that. Let's go. -How's your hand? -Not too bad. -I think you know how bad I feel... -I know. Look. Don't close yourself. At least, let me say that I'm sorry that I spoke to you that way. Forget. I made it. We are all nervous. People with a problem are able to say anything. -That's no excuse for me. -I think it is. I met a lot of men, some good, some bad. But you are different. Glad to go with you. We can get lucky and get out of it. Even if not, we will have some time together. You like me a little, don't you? You should be more confident. -I like you very much. -I'm glad you said that. Now I know that everything will work out for us. As you said, we are all nervous. Especially Clellan. When you arrive in Mexico and are safe with the money, maybe he'll let us go. I wouldn't count on him. Don't try to understand Clellan. Don't try to understand anyone. Miss, help me. Need more salt? That will suffice. This is a woman thing. When they do, it looks great. When they don't, it sucks. It's all right. It's great. The best food I've ever tasted... After a death. Now, even if it's not true. To tell the truth, there is no better food in these parts. There are many tricks in the kitchen. He was willing to show it, if he were to come with us. What you mean? Didn't Trey tell you? -You told me what? -You will not come. I made a deal with Trey. That's how he wanted it. Come eat, boys. I'm going to eat with Crandall. I knew I wasn't going with you and you let me talk to an idiot. -Why? -Why I want you to live. We will pass through a rough land, you will never make it. Alone, I can take a chance. I want you to go to San Francisco. If I can, I'll meet you there. If you can, don't bother. If you don't want me with you now, you don't want me. You wouldn't stand a chance. I thought this was my only chance. -Are you going to serve my food to Mexico? -I wish. But it looks like Trey made a deal with Clellan. It looks like I'll stay here while he keeps you company. -Who told you that? -Clellan. Well, he didn't tell us that. Why would I say? You don't mean anything to him. None of you. Look what he did to Bear. How do you know I won't do the same to you after I get the gold? - Shut up! -Wait, let her talk. -I think you said enough. -I don't care what you think. Papa wants to see you on the rock. We also want to talk to him. Isn't that right, Duncan? Join the others. Let's go. Why did you shake them? If these maniacs turn on each other, they will kill us all. What are you trying to do? Get out of this mess in my own way. This is a lie and you know it. Just trying to attack me -why do you think I disappointed you. -Didn't you do that? -You know I wanted to go with you. -What we want is impossible. You better face it. I just told the truth. -You still don't believe me? -No, I do not believe. What's the matter, guys? Did my food give you a stomach ache? It's not your food, it's the way you've been acting lately. Why will you let the girl go? I thought we would use it to keep Trey on the line. -Or do we not need this anymore? -Do you know what I think? What you think sucks. Don't talk to me like that. I decide what is best for us. Unless... Think you are big enough to change that. And I don't think they are, from the way they're standing. Anything else? Why did you leave Crandall watching people? You said yourself that he doesn't shoot well. -That's what I said. -Why didn't you send Brown and Marsh? -They had time to sleep. - They did. They slept a lot. Poor boys. You don't use your head. I sent them to fetch the supplies. I didn't mean anything in front of the others. They can be brave. We only have 4 men instead of 6. Brown and Marsh will be back tonight with delicious things to eat. -They are not against that, are they? -You should have told us. Maybe, but I didn't want to. I know they won't use it against me if it gives them a big surprise in return for your disappointment. Take a look at the horizon. They're coming. It's the caravan! They are themselves. About 15 miles. Yes. The sun will soon set. They will have to stop. Hey, they are supposed to stop by at noon tomorrow. You look happy. That's how I wanted to see them. Why will we be on our way to Mexico at this time tomorrow. Go tell the good news to Crandall. He'll be sad that he didn't see it first, but... That's life, isn't it? Simmons, can you handle being on watch tonight? I know you've been awake for a long time. Do not worry about me. I feel good. We'll get some sleep and leave in a few hours. But don't forget, no shooting. The sound goes far in the desert. - We can't risk it. -And watch Trey. -He's smart and slippery. -He won't bother me. He lost the courage to use a gun. -What are you talking about, boy? -I heard him talking to the girl. He killed one and can't forget. I don't care what you heard. He's not a fool. - Isn't that right, Papa? -That's right. Crandall, bring our friends. I have something to say to you. It looks like tomorrow will be the day. I'm not warning you, I'm telling you. My boys and I are nervous about being with one man less. I'm talking about Bear. You remember him. Now, if you do what we say, you can live a long life, but if they don't, i'll have to break the promise I made to Mr. Trey. I do not want to do that. Do you understand. Any question? -You don't have to worry about them. -I am happy with that. Now... Want to take a look at the map? You may want to refresh your memory -is going to travel tomorrow. - I know the way. Just be sure to fulfill your part of the agreement. You know I owe you. I already broke my promises, but nobody can say that I will not return a favor. Now... Feel free. Mr. Simmons will keep you company. Let's go guys. I want you to sit where I can watch you. Let's go. For there. Let's go. Like lambs. I would be happy if they were dead. With Bear dead and someone to watch them, we'll be with less men tomorrow. He's right, Papa. 5 men is not the same as 7. I can tell, boys, but we'll do it my way. Besides, we don't need 7 men. When the guards reach the passage, they will be easy targets. We could even kill them with stones. So, stop worrying. We need to rest and prepare for the big day. -I'm with you, Papa. -And you, Duncan? Of course I am, Papa. Why? Well, you have been talking a lot to someone so quiet. Which makes me think you have something in mind. I have. I've been thinking about all that money and how well we will live with it. Keep thinking about it. This will prevent you from dying. Try to sleep. I can't sleep thinking about those soldiers. I can't forget them either. -If there was a way to... -Please don't try anything... Hey, you two. If you have anything to say, I want to hear it. I was just asking her if she wanted a drink. Mind if I take one? Feel free. After me, of course. Where are you going? I'll get two glasses. Want a shot? You need. What are you trying to do? Get me drunk? Since when does anyone get drunk on a dose? Ah, forget it. I'm just trying to be friendly. Right. Go back there. Thank you, Ben. It went down well. Leave it here and don't drink anymore. There is nothing like that. Makes you think of taking another one. I will try to reach the next city. You won't be able to. It will be like the other time. Why would anyone ride at night? Maybe he has something to do, like us. Maybe it's a bad deal. He may have come from Mesa. IT IS. Certainly. Here they come. Only shoot after I give the orders. It is better to return to your post before the Pope explodes your head. -I had a drink... -That drink it almost cost us our lives. Papa is right. -You missed. -Maybe yes, but I'm not alone. And Trey? Didn't you see how the Pope treated him after what he did? Yes, I was sure he would kill you. No, he needs it. I just wonder how long he will need us. -He wouldn't do anything to us. -Not? And Bear? Can be. What difference will we make to the Pope after we take the gold? None, except share with him. We will not share anything with him. Except maybe one of my bullets. You will have to be faster than me. Mind if we stretch? Papa said to be seated, then you will be seated, if you don't want to die. Mind if we talk? I don't care what they do, as long as they don't move. I told you to stay put. -I was just going to offer you a drink. -How did you do with Simmons? Don't come near me, because I don't like you. I don't want anything to do with you. Stretch, boys. They just broke a wheel. This waiting will kill me. Don't think about waiting, boy. Think of that shiny metal. We will get what we deserve. I think we have a little time. I want one of you to see how Crandall is doing. You, Marsh. There is nothing ugly or worthless in an empty bottle. Just look. Just now, there was something alive. How are you doing, boy? Better than Simmons. Why are you here? Did something go wrong? Nothing serious. A cart broke a wheel, so they’ll be a little late. Just wait. Before noon we will be as rich as ever. Go outside and fire that gun. They started walking. Let's go. - We don't stand a chance. -Let's get out of here. Duncan, don't leave me. Duncan! -I'm bleeding a lot. -Naturally. You bleed when you are shot. Do you remember? Come on, Duncan! The shot that hit you was aimed at you. Ben can help me. As soon as you leave and help those soldiers... I will arrest you, Simmons. No way. You won't be able to. Are you going to get the gun you can't use? Stay still like a good boy. I will do you a big favor. I will end your suffering. You never have to worry about another weapon. You can go with us. This is kind of you, but I will go with Mr. Trey. Sergeant? Would you have any refreshing liquid with you? If we talk about whiskey, we load a little bit on the wagon for medicinal purposes. There I go again. Maybe I'm not as strong as I thought. I think it's best to accept your offer and go with you. I know what you mean. Nothing like a good dose for a bad heart. Ben found a new George. - It looks like I'll be traveling alone. - You don't have to do that. I would be happy if you came with us to San Francisco. I'll take a few days off and show you around. I think he would have more fun if I showed him the place. This is a better offer than the army. Certainly. Attention! Mount! In front! You heard what he said.
