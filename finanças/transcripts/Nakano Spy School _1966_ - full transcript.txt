I, Jiro Miyoshi, graduated from the Reserve Officers' Cadet School and became a second lieutenant of the Imperial Japanese Army. You look so distinguished! Your father would have been so proud. He always used to say, "If you want to move up in life, then pursue a military career.” Jiro, that uniform suits you well. We used your savings to buy this uniform. Thank you. Yukiko, isn't it too early for you to go to work? I came early so I could accompany him on his walk. When are you two getting married? I can hardly wait to see Yukiko in her wedding dress. The 57th Regiment Come in! Second Lt. Miyoshi, reporting for duty. We received a call from the regimental commander. Go to Regimental HQ immediately. Come in! Second Lt. Miyoshi, reporting for duty. I'm Lt. Colonel Kusanagi of the Army General Staff. You look very fit. What do you practice? Kendo or judo? Kendo, sir. What rank? Second dan, sir. You have intellect as well. You graduated from Tokyo Imperial University with flying colors. What are your future plans? I wish be a banker or corporate employee, sir. Your father was a police officer. Yes. He died from an illness when I was six. So your mother raised you by herself? Correct. By the way, do you like women? I do not dislike them. If you're in love, would you sleep with a woman right away? Would you get naked? What if the woman you love asks you to die with her? Everything pertaining to women depends on who the woman is. If a woman betrays you, how would you exact revenge? I have no way of knowing until that happens. Where is Timor on the map? Timor is not on this map. And what did you see underneath the map? A military hat, a bag, a pen, a tea cup, - a box of cigarettes... - What brand? Cherry, sir. A matchbox, an ashtray... Inside the ashtray? Two cigarette butts. Well done. Next, I'll ask you a series of questions. Answer them all in one go. Are you ready? How much money can you spend in one night? What are five differences between Christianity and Buddhism? What are the strengths and weaknesses of communism? Can you commit suicide right this moment? My destiny changed forever upon meeting this strange lieutenant colonel from the Army General Staff. One week later, a confidential order requested my presence at the Army Ministry. My thoughts instantly turned to Yukiko, who was working at a trading company in Marunouchi, Tokyo. Please come in. Mr. Bentley, I made six copies of the contract. Perfect, as usual. Thank you. Well then, please accept this check, madam. How generous of you. I am sorry to always impose on you. I'm satisfied just knowing that this will be used to help the poor. Mr. Bentley, how's work these days? I must admit, it's a bit tense. The goods I sell, like whiskey and tea, are now deemed excessively luxurious. Importing such items has become restricted. All because of the wretched war. The tea's ready. Thank you. Everything has gone up in price recently. I've decided — it's only fair that I pay twice as much for rent. So, please stop working as a seamstress. Oh, no! I feel embarrassed simply taking money from the daughter of one of my old friends. You needn't pay more. You have nothing to worry about. I enjoy working. Mother. I'll be going away for work. Where are you going? It's a military secret. I was told to bring business attire, kendo equipment and a judo gi. Some kind of training, I suppose. I should be back in no time. I hope so. Mother, do you still refuse to live with Ichiro and his wife? Of course. Your brother is never in one place. He's always being reassigned and relocated. And that wife of his has such a harsh personality. I prefer being with you and Yukiko. Jiro, can I have a word? What is it? It's about us... when can we get married? I'm a reserve officer candidate. Even if I'm dispatched to China or Manchuria, I'll be discharged after two years. Two years? That long? It's because of the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, isn't it? Mr. Bentley's always saying that Japan should end this senseless war. That's because he's British. I agree with him. Naturally, as a woman. I despise wars. Two years will fly by. We can marry once I return. Kiss me. I'm so glad I left home... because I met you. If I had listened to my parents, I would have been married to our landlord's spoiled son. Please look after my mother while I'm gone. Now then, I need to wake up early tomorrow. Kiss me again. The next morning, eighteen Imperial Japanese Army second lieutenants gathered at the Yasukuni Shrine. We were taken inside the Women's Patriotic Association HQ, to a two story wooden barrack adjacent the Military Hall. Training Center for Rear Duties Personnel to a two story wooden barrack adjacent the Military Hall. Training Center for Rear Duties Personnel Such an odd place. What's going on? Salute! Thank you for coming. Allow me to explain why you are here. The reason why I have gathered you here is to train you as spies for a year. For the foreseeable future, this will be your classroom and your home. Clearly, this is a top secret operation. You must take off your military uniforms and put on your business suits. Military jargon is prohibited. Speak like ordinary citizens. That's all. Any questions? A spy school? That took all of us by surprise. Why have you chosen us to be spies? Because all of you excelled at the reserve officers' schools. You are mentally and physically superior. But why select from reservists? A spy must be a well-rounded individual. Graduates from military schools are too unyielding. You, on the other hand, are sophisticated graduates from prestigious universities. But isn't the Army's Foreign Affairs Dept. already carrying out spy operations? And yet... every single one of them is an amateur. They're no match against spies from other developed countries, especially Britain, which has a history of espionage going back four centuries. I plan to transform you into spies that will surpass them all. Are we allowed to see our friends and family during training? No. You will abandon your real names and adopt aliases immediately. You must break all contact with the outside world. You may even have to forfeit your family records. But you're asking us to forsake our futures. I know it's hard. Many of you would have become university presidents, CEOs, even government ministers. I'm fully aware. But we're asking you to give all of that up! Why? Japan is already at war with China. War with the west appears imminent. I don't need to tell you all how vital spies are to the war effort. A single spy is worth a twenty thousand soldier division. There are eighteen of you here. With eighteen of you, we will double Japan's military power. Are we truly capable of becoming spies? Of course. In just one year? I handpicked you for a reason. Only you can complete this task. Listen. Whether Japan prospers or perishes is up to you. I ask you to put everything behind you. Join me and become spies for the good of Japan! A soldier doesn't disobey orders, but that wasn't why I agreed to become a spy. I was overcome by his passion. Henceforth, I changed my surname from Miyoshi to Shiina. I consigned my military uniform to the bottom of my suitcase, never to see the light of day again. Your name? Jiro Shiina. University? Tokyo Imperial. I'm Sugimoto from Waseda. This is Tezuka from Meiji. That's Kai from Housei. This is Kubota from Keio. Behind him is Miyagi from Rikkyo. Wow, all the big league Tokyo schools. They're pseudonyms. I don't know their real names. Now that we've given up our names, our loves, our futures, what will become of us? I wanted to be a lawyer. I have no desire to be a spy for the rest of my life. I suppose it's farewell to our specially tailored military uniforms. But think about it, being a spy could be a damn bit more interesting than getting killed off on the frontline in Manchuria. I heard some are even born with a spy predisposition. At any rate, we're cut off from the world, almost like we've been banished to a remote island. Let's accept our fate, get along, and see how far we can go. And instill our trust in Kusanagi? Intensive training began the next day. We underwent martial arts and military training. However, the majority of training focused on politics, economics, and foreign affairs. Our teachers were university professors. There was no roll call or curfew at night, and we were free to do as we pleased. Yet, no one went out, and we all studied hard. Still studying? Jiro, what are you reading? American history, sir. Hey, everyone, I brought sushi and sake. No more studying tonight. Drink well and sleep well. "A well-slept child is a well-kept child.” I'm home. Welcome home. Have you heard anything from Jiro? No, not yet. It's strange. He's so methodical, but he hasn't contacted us in over a month... I wonder what happened. Perhaps he was sent to China or Manchuria. Alright. I'm going to take time off from work to search for him. Pardon me. I really don't know what's happened to Second Lt. Miyoshi. I just asked the regimental commander, but he has absolutely no idea. But Jiro belongs to this regiment, doesn't he? I find it hard to believe that you wouldn't know where he is. What's your relationship with Second Lt. Miyoshi? Are you his lover? I'm his fiancée. Oh, you're engaged. You can try visiting Regimental HQ. They may know something. We have no information concerning Second Lt. Miyoshi. Then where can I go to find out? Let's see. Personnel information is handled by the War Ministry's Personnel Bureau. But it won't do you any good to go barging in. Fortunately, I know someone there... would you like a letter of introduction? Please. Around this time, the spy school changed its base to an old telegraph unit building in Nakano. In the barracks next to the rear gate, we commenced full-fledged spy training. During espionage, assassination and sabotage are inevitable. On the table are a package, a brick, a can of food and a chunk of coal. These innocuous objects are sophisticated time bombs. Lethal gas, poison, and bacteria can be used to discretely eliminate a target. Substances that kill slowly, such as arsenic and mercury chloride, are recommended over fast-acting chemicals like strychnine and cyanide. The poisoning of a target must go undetected. Today, an expert magician will demonstrate the proper technique. A spy must know how to open envelopes with a bamboo stick, and pick door locks with a piece of metal wire in order to obtain intelligence. The packages resembling a cigarette box and match box are miniature microphones. The walking stick, watch, cigarette case and belt buckle contain hidden cameras. Today's instructor came all the way from Fuchu Penitentiary. He is Japan's number one safecracker. Please. To crack open a safe, you utilize the ears and the fine sensation in the fingertips. You'll need quite a bit of practice to get it down pat. It is more difficult to send information than to gather information. Even if you write a letter with invisible ink, or write thousands of words on the back of a stamp, or make a microfilm copy and hide it under a shirt button, or inside a cigar, it will be discovered immediately. Presently, the most widely used method is to transmit encrypted messages via radiotelegraph. Decoding secret messages is vitally crucial; once we have successfully decoded the enemy's messages, victory is within arm's reach. There are two different ways to encrypt a secret message: codes and ciphers. To code is to replace a word with another word or number. Spies are eventually caught and arrested. When that day comes, you cannot succumb to torture. You may have your limbs cut off, tongue removed, and eyes gouged, but you must endure it and continue on your mission. Committing suicide by poisoning is the last resort — only when concrete evidence is presented against you. Now then, today we will demonstrate various torture techniques. The instructor is a Tokyo Metropolitan Police senior investigator. Please. There are many instruments of torture. For example, if you continuously listen to noise from this machine, you will go insane in less than an hour. Please stop! Stop it! Make it stop! Hey! Wake up! Hey! Nakanishi hung himself in the bathroom! Nakanishi! Nakanishi! One, two... No use. He's not coming back. Why would he kill himself? Perhaps a nervous breakdown. He wasn't himself lately. He wasn't strong enough to cope with the training. Tonight is Nakanishi's vigil. Drink as much as you want. Aren't you going to drink? Chief, will happen to Nakanishi's body? Are you going to secretly dispose of it? I would never do such a stupid thing. He'll be reported as killed in action and his ashes will be sent back to his family. His pension will be granted as well. I know what you're thinking. I drove Nakanishi to his death. I'm the one responsible for his suicide. And you're absolutely correct. Spy training is new for me, too. I have no experience. I demanded too much, too soon. Nakanishi paid the ultimate price. I killed him. Please forgive me, Nakanishi. Even for those of you who preserve and become spies, the future is bleak. Spies rarely come back in one piece. Most are apprehended and killed like dogs. Even if you succeed, no one will know... no medals awarded. It's pitiable. Listen well. If you don't wish to become a spy, you can quit tonight. Do not hesitate. Chief, to be honest, I would like to live an ordinary life once again. As would I. Any others? Even if it's for the good of the nation, I cannot stomach stealing, lying, and committing murder. I agree. Alright. I won't stop those of you who want to quit. But, heed what I have to say first. Real spies aren't criminals who murder and steal. Those spies are the lowest of the low. The true essence of a spy is empathy. - Empathy? - Indeed. Empathy and spirit. Colonel Akashi is a spy I greatly admire. He played a vital role during the Japan-Russo War. Akashi treated the Russian people with empathy. He believed that to improve the lives of the Russian people, the Russian Imperial Government had to be destroyed. He befriended Lenin and ingratiated himself with the Bolsheviks, supplying funds and arms and undermining the Russian government. The colonel paved the way for Japanese victory. This is what a real spy does. My goal is to turn each of you into a Colonel Akashi, then dispatch you around the world. Become friends with all the people in those territories, battle their corrupt governments and all invaders. Especially in Asia and Africa, liberate the colonized territories and their people! Isn't that a job for army officers stationed overseas like Colonel Akashi? Army officers these days are useless. They're all on the fast track to promotion, returning to Japan after only a year or two. In comparison, you'll be based in the same territory for decades — if necessary. Never mind an army division — each of you will equal an entire country. I want the seventeen of you to reconstruct the world. But, in reality, isn't Japan intent on colonizing China and enslaving other Asian nations? You're right. I spied in China and Siberia after graduating from the military academy. I realized that something had to change. It took me ten years to put this school together. I established this school against the army's will. If you all quit, my life-long dream will vanish. But... that's not what's important. If we stand idly, ignorant politicians and military leadership will turn all of Asia against Japan. Japan will be doomed. Please. I ask that you fight them and save Japan. But there are only seventeen of us. No matter how hard we try, it will be of little use. Don't be silly. You're young! There's nothing youth cannot accomplish. The Meiji Restoration was realized by youth just like yourselves. Please. Do it! Chief, I understand now. I will gladly become a spy. So will I. I'll fight for the independence of India. And I'll fight for Southeast Asia. I'll smash the European colonialists to pieces. Sugimoto. The fate of not only Nakano, but the rest of Japan is resting squarely on your shoulders. Do you still want to quit? Let's do it. As a Japanese youth, I'll stake my life. What about the rest of you? I understand. Tezuka? Count me in. Thank you. Your efforts won't be in vain. I'll demand that you be treated as graduate staff officers of the General Staff College. And I'll do my utmost to help you become major generals. Chief, we aren't concerned about our futures. We just want to achieve your dream. I see. This means a great deal to me. Thank you. I have no words to express my gratitude. We were once again overcome by his passion. Unexpectedly, Nakanishi's death served only to heighten our resolve. Army Ministry General Staff Office The Lt. Colonel frequented the 18th Section Army Ministry General Staff Office The Lt. Colonel frequented the 18th Section at the General Staff Office. This section was known as the Decryption Dept., The 18th Section This section was known as the Decryption Dept., and it oversaw the decoding of secret messages. The 18th Section The 18th Section Kusanagi, how's Nakano doing? Think you can manufacture some useful spies? Just wait and see. They're a talented bunch. No one at General Staff is taking you seriously. You have the students in disheveled barracks, and you've limited their training to a year. It's so archaic. What could you possibly accomplish? That's precisely the point. We aren't force feeding information to a large mass of students. It's an intensive, day to day struggle. A student's ability shows through, if it's there. It's education in its purest form. But they're recent graduates; amateurs. Employing reserve officer candidates as spies is too risky. One mistake and it could turn into a foreign affairs disaster. Why not leave it to the experienced military officials? Don't fret. Nakano won't compete with your department. Captain Maeda, return to your seat. What brings you here today? Your old classmate has a request. Since we aren't formally acknowledged by the Army Ministry, we have no budget. Could you funnel some funds from your own department? Impossible. The Army Ministry has scant regard for intelligence. We barely have enough money as it is. There isn't enough to go around. But you know several high ranking Army Ministry officers. They're only concerned with waging wars and winning medals. They would never invest in spy training. It was worth a try... You're a curious one. Highly intelligent, yet eschewed the General Staff College to teach a bunch of reluctant students instead. Are you going to waste your life away with this spy stuff? That's just the way I am. I've already told you: the Army Ministry's Personnel Bureau has no information regarding his whereabouts. Persistence is useless. Are you telling me the truth? - I do not lie. - But... Could you please check one more time? I've already made myself clear. Second Lt. Miyoshi is your….? My fiancé. Try as I might, I can't find him. To be missing in the military means he fled, was captured by the enemy, or committed treason. Whatever the case may be, it can only mean dishonor. Umm... well... is there any way I can work at the General Staff Office? Why? If I work here, I may be able to find Jiro someday. I know how to type in English. Where did you learn? After I graduated college, I went to a specialized school for three months. Give me the details. I may be able to help you. To locate your fiancé, you're going to work at the General Staff Office? I understand. Losing a skilled typist like yourself is unfortunate, but I sympathize fully. It can't be helped. I apologize for making such a selfish request. Don't apologize. But how pathetic of the Japanese Army to lose track of your fiancé's whereabouts. I've lived in Japan for twenty years, and I have many friends here, and they all criticize the Japanese Army's arrogance. Battles are waged left and right and civilian lives continue deteriorating. - You're also a victim, aren't you? - Yes. There's not enough sugar, salt, matches... and our ragged clothing tears easily. On top of that, the value of currency keeps falling due to inflation. Innocent civilians suffer, meanwhile, the militarists make out like bandits. As someone who loves Japan, it's outraging. Mr. Bentley, thank you for everything you've done. Take care of yourself. I have affluent friends. I'll try to pull strings to glean information concerning your fiancé. Please, I beg of you! Army Communications Research Institute At that time, the training at Nakano was entering its final phase. Army Communications Research Institute Army Communications Research Institute An effective spy can seamlessly hide their own identity and masquerade as someone else. To do so requires mastering at least two languages, as well as two different occupations. I concentrated on learning English and Chinese. And as occupations, I selected cooking and tailoring. Large pot, mid-sized pot, small pot, petit knife, chopper, slice, meat knife…. Today, we will learn from an actor who specializes in female roles in kabuki theater. The best disguises are kept simple. Stop! Once your dancing improves, we'll go to a bar... in groups of four to five. For that occasion, don your finest suits and shoes. Wear foreign pomade and cologne in order to disguise yourselves as high class gentlemen. Welcome, Mr. Cherry Corporation President. Let those kids drink to their hearts' content. Are they all military men? They don't have crew cuts, so they must be in the Navy. What makes you say that? Those are my employees. Food is scarce right now. Only military men can be that fit. I really like you. What's your name? Me? My name's Harue. Don't forget it. Women are a double edged sword. When tamed properly, you can extract critical information, but fall head over heels, and you may get yourself killed. Therefore, you must learn to arouse a woman while remaining calm and unaffected. Women's erogenous zones are spread throughout their bodies. However, the most sensitive parts are the ears, neck, underarms, and of course… I'm exhausted! How amusing... a company president who can cut a drunken figure without taking a single sip. - Hey, fetch me some water. - Yes. Everyone, do your best to entertain and satisfy these women tonight. - Hey. - Yes? Do you have the girls ready? I have six beautiful girls lined up. They should be arriving soon. Chief. I have an emergency. I must excuse myself. You won't test yourself in a real scenario? No. - Good evening. - Come in. Good evening! Oh, Tezuka, it's you. Welcome. How can you afford to come every night? This place isn't cheap. That's not important. You'll let me stay at your apartment tonight, won't you? I want to marry you. I'm divorced and I have a child. I work at the bar to support my child. Tezuka, is that alright with you? I'll support both of you. I love you. Can you all confirm that these swords are yours? Yes, but why are they here? Tezuka stole them, then tried to sell them. Tezuka? He was caught and arrested on the spot by the military police. But why would he do such a stupid thing? He was involved with a bar hostess and needed the money. Is Tezuka still in military police custody? No. They've temporarily returned him until his officer status has been confirmed. What a bind. The military police are unwavering... stealing military swords is unforgivable for someone of his rank. They're determined to have him court-martialed and punished. I'm out of ideas. I wish this could just quietly go away. Tezuka, if you needed money, why didn't you come ask us? Not only that, how dare you call yourself a Nakano student while having a relationship with a bar hostess! Where's your sense of pride?! I no longer want to be a spy. I want to return to an ordinary life. Do you think you're the only one suffering? We all want to sleep with women or be promoted. But we grit our teeth and bear it! But what did you do? You pilfered our swords and sold them. You should be ashamed of yourself! Forgive me. I'm prepared for a court-martial, along with all the consequences. Absolutely not. We won't allow it. What? Think about it. Your actions will come out in military court and stain the reputation of our school. We won't have people mock Nakano and call it a school for thieves. What would happen to our chief's reputation? What would happen to this school?! This school isn't formally acknowledged to begin with. It's reputation will be ruined, causing it to be shut down. Have you no appreciation for our chief's tireless efforts? Then what should I do? What do you want me to do? There's only one way to save Nakano and make amends with the chief. Tezuka, commit suicide! That's right! Commit suicide! If you die honorably, the military police will feel sympathetic and dismiss this entire incident. Take responsibility; for the sake of the school and our chief! But… You bastard! Are you so spineless you can't even commit suicide? You've disgraced the chief, along with each and every one of us... yet you still wish to live?! I don't know the proper method of committing suicide. Never mind proper. All it takes is courage and determination. Do it! Tezuka! No, I can't do it. You're pathetic. Alright. I'll hold the sword... close your eyes and run at me. Tezuka! Right here in front of us, and do it bravely! Tezuka, don't be a coward! Die! Run at him! Tezuka! Come! Fine! If you all want me to die that much, then I'll do it! - You all want me to die, right?! - That's right! Go! You've killed Tezuka! No, he committed honorable suicide. That's a lie! It's true, he understood and did so willingly. Why did you let him die? There was no other way. This was the only way to save the school and your reputation. What? Chief, Nakano was your dream. Now it's ours. We absolutely do not want it gone. That's right. I understand how you feel, but… This school has only just begun. We are at a critical juncture; we'll advance the school's reputation and have it succeed, at whatever cost. For the future of Japan, for the future of the world. I understand. Say no more. I will notify the military police. I'm sure they'll understand. There's no doubt that we all were responsible for killing Tezuka. But it was at that precise moment when we began to love the school. None of us could turn back now. Tezuka was reported as killed in action and his ashes were sent back to his family. The 18th Section Make twenty copies of the British Embassy's coded message. Yes, sir. Have you gotten used to working here? Yes, thank you. You're fortunate I'm with the Decryption Dept. We have a constant need for skilled typists from well-to-do families. I really do appreciate it. Have you learned anything about your fiancé? I've asked many people, yet nothing… If that's the case, shouldn't you give up searching? Captain Maeda! The colonel requests your presence. Did you receive the funds I sent you the other day? Yes, thank you. You're the only one in General Staff that understands the importance of espionage. And above all, you're a true friend. So what brings you here today? I hope it's not about money again. Unfortunately, it is. I've already spent everything you gave me. Spy training is really expensive. There's a limit. I can't give you money that often. Captain Maeda, reporting for duty. Following the Tripartite Pact between Italy, Germany and Japan, our enemy has shifted from Russia to the British Empire. Are you aware? Of course, sir. The Army Ministry has been pestering me to decode Britain's secret messages. Britain is under your jurisdiction. What is the current status? We've analyzed the statistical data and it appears to be a five-number code. That's all we know... You haven't decoded anything at all? No. Captain Maeda! The Americans successfully decoded our secret messages, causing us great misery. Why can't we do likewise to the British? You cannot compare us to the United States. Their decryption staff numbers in the hundreds, is heavily funded... Are you saying our meager Decryption Dept. is useless? Or, do you consider decoding beneath you because it won't win you medals or get you promoted? No, sir. I will endeavor to decode it. You're excused. Iwakura, why don't you do it? I specialize in Chinese. I don't have time to decode English messages. Then Nakano will simply have to steal Britain's codebook. What? Payback for all the funding you've provided. Can you really pull it off? - Students from your archaic school...? - Sure, but it'll cost you. Yukiko, I was waiting for you. Did something happen? It's concerning your fiancé, but I cannot discuss it here. Please come to my house. This way. Did you learn something about Jiro? It pains me to say, but… Is he dead? Unfortunately, yes. Furthermore, he was shot to death. How can that be? Why was he shot? He was executed for speaking out against the war and criticizing the Army Ministry. It's probably been kept secret due to potential public backlash. Is that true? I asked a friend who's acquainted with the Army Vice Minister. There's no doubt about it. To think they would kill such a promising young man... Is the army really so awful? The Japanese Army is deplorable. They aim to do battle with the entire world, even if it destroys Japan in the process. Japan's true enemy is its own army. Japan's intellectuals are currently partnering with Britain and America and are prepared to fight the Japanese Army. Won't you join us? For the prosperity of Japanese citizens, for the murder of your husband? What do I do? You work at the Army General Staff Office. You can let us know what the army is doing. Are you asking me to be a spy? No, you just need to be a good friend. If we all work together, we can put a halt to the army's wicked plans. Please let me think it over... You want to leave this house? I'm sorry. It's so sudden. Are you going back home? I want to find an apartment for myself. Why? Do you not like it here? Now matter how hard I tried, I couldn't find Jiro. I want to think on my own for a while. I see. It will be lonely with the two of you gone. I hoped you would stay with me, like a real daughter. I'm sorry. No need to apologize. You're young. You need to go out and live your life. But, I'll continue waiting here for Jiro... even if he never returns. Your training is nearly complete and graduation is close at hand. But first, there will be an examination. The examination is... an act of real life espionage. What will we be doing? You are my top three students, and I'm entrusting you. You are responsible for stealing Britain's codebook. This request comes directly from General Staff. Our school's current reputation is less than favorable, and there are talks of shutting us down, but if you are successful, the military leadership will be forced to change their minds. Give it all you've got. Chief, we promise to retrieve the codebook. Never promise anything. Spies mustn't make promises. Withdraw if you feel you're in danger, even if you're just one inch away from retrieving it! Understood. Real espionage does not require knowledge or technical acumen, but the courage, reflexes, and ingenuity to overcome each and every obstacle! Shiina, what's your plan? Security is tight in the British Embassy at Tokyo. And consulates far away from Tokyo won't have the codebook... I plan to target the consulate at Yokohama. Sugimoto, did you look into the consulate's servants? A cook, a butler, a maid... about ten in total. All Chinese. They've made sure not to hire any Japanese. Anyone we can bribe? The Chinese cook, Li Shimei. He's bribable. How about it? Will you help us? As long as I am sufficiently compensated. Be it Japan or Britain — it won't make much of a difference who comes out the victor. According to Li, the codebook is locked away in a safe inside the code room. The keys are held by the consul and the radio operator. What's the radio operator like? His name is Oscar Davidson. About thirty years old. He's resided in Yokohama for a decade and speaks fluent Japanese. He loves drinking, gambling, women... anything and everything. Quite the heavy spender. I'll take care of him. How will you get close to him? A Japanese tailor with American communist ties has arrived from Canada. His name is Haraguchi. I'll impersonate him. What about the real one? I'll explain the matter to the police and have him secluded somewhere for a few months. A short time later, I met with Haraguchi at the police station. I'm Shiina from the Tokyo District Attorney's Office. You are under suspicion of commerce law violations. Answer every question. Yes. You were born in Hiroshima in 1912. You moved to Canada upon finishing Elementary School. Where did you first reside? Seattle. I researched Haraguchi’s entire past and learned to speak with a Canadian English accent. After opening a clothing store in Yokohama, I frequented the same hotel bar Davidson visited every night. Welcome. What will it be? The usual. Whiskey with water. Mr. Davidson, you don't look too well. I'm in the middle of a losing streak. I have so much debt. Poker again? Gambling's no good. Why don't you just quit? That's easier said than done. The moment I had been waiting for finally arrived. I own a clothing store in Motomachi. How about it, why don't we have a friendly game? With you? I fell in love with poker during my time in America. I'm always trying to find people to play with. If you have some time to spare, how about indulging me tonight? Davidson accepted my challenge and we played poker in one of the hotel rooms. I intentionally lost every time. I win yet again. Still want to keep going? Let's call it a night. I'm out of money. I can lend you some money. How about another game? I really don't want to end on a losing note. Alright, one more game. I lost the next round and three days later, I visited Davidson at the British Consulate to award him his winnings. You really got me the other night. Gambling is quite an odd addiction. The more you lose, the more stubborn you become. Let's play again sometime. Haraguchi, you lost on purpose, didn't you? Not at all. I was simply outplayed. Say, how about letting me tailor your suits? I have to get my money back somehow. I can fashion you suits made out of the finest British fabric. How are you getting your hands on British fabric? It's banned from import. Well, I have my ways. Are you getting it from American communists? How do you know? I had you investigated. Why is a communist interested in me? Are you interested in something inside the consulate? No, not at all. Quite the contrary... I'd like to sell you beneficial information. Information? I have a few clients who are technology officers in the Japanese Navy. They often mention the battleships and fighter jets they're building. I figure I'd make some money by sharing the information with you. Of course, I won't keep all the profit to myself. I can give you thirty percent. What information specifically? Here. If you find it satisfactory enough, then pay my store a visit. I wouldn't want the military police on my case for frequenting this place. How is it? It looks excellent. Quite the compliment from someone whose country makes the finest garments. Here are your trousers. The mirror's in the front of the store. Come. This way please. How's the fit? How's the length of the trousers? About right. The width should be satisfactory. Yes. It's fine. How was the information I provided? When I brought it to the consul he said he would purchase it. The Japanese Navy is currently building a new class battleship. Can you get your hands on that data? I can obtain the information by this Sunday. Then come to the consulate that very evening. Everyone else is traveling, so it's just me and the servants. We can chat and play poker in my room. That sounds like a great idea. But I promise I won't lose this time. These are the four keys created from the clay imprints. This is most likely the one for the safe. Can you take care of the dial lock? If it's for the good of the country, I'll crack open any safe! Sugimoto, I'm going to the consulate tonight. Have you made arrangements with the cook? Yes, I have. Just make sure Davidson stays in his room all night playing poker. The code room is on the first floor. The servants are in the basement. Davidson's room is located on the third floor. Why don't we move on from battleships to poker? Let's listen to some American jazz as well. Alright, back to my winning ways. Pair of queens. Pair of aces. How unfortunate, you lost again. How about calling it quits? It's not over just yet. Pair of tens. Two pairs of fives. - Are you going to keep playing until you win? - Of course! I'll take you out to a restaurant today. - To a restaurant? - Don't worry. It's for military personnel only. As we're in the midst of a food shortage, I thought you'd appreciate some things you haven't had in a while. In that case… To tell the truth, I'm very fond of you. I want to marry you. You should forget about your missing fiancé. Think about your future. Captain Maeda. - What is it? - The colonel requests your presence. I'll return soon. Wait for me. Well done! If we can use this to crack the British code, our department's reputation will be saved. Thank you, Kusanagi. Don't thank me, thank my students. Tell the rest of the Army Ministry about our school. I want Nakano to gain official status and get fully funded. Alright. I'll do as you say. Captain Maeda, reporting for duty. Maeda, this is a copy of Britain's codebook. Who do you think obtained this for us? The military police? Nakano. Those amateur students that you and the rest of the staff officers make fun of on a daily basis. - I don't believe it. - Captain Maeda! Yes, sir. See to it that Britain's messages are deciphered immediately. You shall not rest until every message is decoded. Yukiko, I'm sorry, but I have to postpone our engagement. Let's go some other time. What happened? I was looking forward to it... We have Britain's codebook. We'll have to work all night to decipher every message. Communications Research Lab All military personnel entering Nakano must dress in business attire. That applies to Army General Staff personnel as well, even if there are only a hundred of you! Why are you in your military uniform?! My apologies. What brings you here? I am here to return the copy of Britain's codebook. It's useless. Why? The British found out immediately after it was stolen and altered their entire coding system. What? We can use this to decipher past messages, however, for any present and future messages, it's utterly useless. How can that be? I understand that this is a spy training school, but do you also instruct them on how to get caught easily? Or did your aloof students steal an outdated codebook? Whatever the case may be, it's pathetic. You have to be kidding! We aren't foolish enough to leave a trace. We left everything exactly the way it was, and locked both the safe and the code room before leaving. Did that Chinese cook betray us? But we haven't given him the full payment yet. That greedy bastard would have waited to get the full amount first. So then, how did the British find out? It's very unlikely we made any mistakes. If there were any leaks, they would have come from the General Staff Office. I'll investigate the Decryption Dept. You believe it leaked from the Decryption Dept.? How dare you! You better not insult the General Staff! This is the finest organization in the army. It's composed of elite soldiers. There are no idiots here who would leak information! There are civilian secretaries and typists, but they all come from proper upbringings. I cannot imagine one of them being a British spy. Are you trying to cover up your mistakes and blame us for your wrongdoings? I should have known, coming from a spy school amateur. You're a disgrace. Maeda! That's enough. Nevertheless, my suspicions did not waver. I continued investigating the Decryption Dept. Yukiko was there... among the typists. I followed Yukiko. Not because I suspected her of being a spy. Japanese Symphonic Orchestra I just wanted to watch her. Japanese Symphonic Orchestra Japanese Symphonic Orchestra I wanted to see what her life was like. However… Nothing. Since gas doesn't work, let's see if it reacts to a chemical. How do you know there's a secret message on the back of the ticket? I'll tell you later. Whose bag is it? I'll tell you that later as well. You're being awfully unforthcoming. Got it! It's in English. You saved Britain. The payment will be sent to your apartment. What is this? Just as I suspected... What's wrong, Shiina? Chief, the leak came from the General Staff Office. How did you find out? A typist there gave the information to Ralph Bentley, the British president of a trading company. Ralph is almost certainly a spy. He must have notified Britain and had them change the codes. How did the typist find out? According to my investigation, the typist began working there under Captain Maeda's recommendation. They're close. So Maeda leaked the information... A Decryption Dept. typist has access to every message that the Army Minister sees. To have planted a spy in such a place... the British are clever. Alright. Let's notify the military police and have both Ralph and the typist arrested immediately. What's the typist's name? Yukiko Nunobiki. She's my fiancée. What did you say? She joined the General Staff Office... to locate my whereabouts. I see. So that's what happened. This is all my fault. Shiina, do you resent me now? No. Shiina, she'll be treated horribly if she's handed over to the military police. It's out of my control. They'll torture her, and since she's a woman, sexually abuse her as well. We're talking about the military police... she'll be stripped naked — defiled in ways that would make the most iron casted stomach churn. And after it's all said and done, she'll be executed. I am aware. Do you want to help her escape? I love Yukiko. But if we save her, we won't be able to capture Ralph. Nakano would be a laughing stock forever. Please do not hesitate to report her to the military police. Shiina, if she's inevitably going to die, why don't you do it? She'll be happier that way. What do you recommend I do? Kill her by your own hands. Poison her with something painless. Make it appear like a suicide. Take her out before the military police can get their hands on her. Who is it? Go ahead. Jiro. You're alive! Do you know how much I've searched for you?! I'm sorry. Please forgive me. Where were you? What are you doing now? You're no longer with the military? I'll explain everything later. Anyway, let's go out. It's been a while. Why don't we have dinner together? Wait, let me get ready. I am with the military police. We wish to see Ralph Bentley. Ralph Bentley, you are under arrest for violating the Maintenance of Public Order Act, the National Defense Act and the Military Secret Protection Law! We request that you accompany us to our HQ! I understand. Allow me to change. I must warn you, the house is surrounded. I know. What are you doing?! I smell cyanide. It's strange... you never knew how to dance before. Such a fancy suit, too. What do you do for a living now? We can talk about work tomorrow. For now, why don't we dance, drink, and then head to a hotel? Hotel? It doesn't feel like we've been apart for a year. It feels like a dream. Are you really Jiro? It's you. You're actually here. Jiro, did you think about me? Of course. You're the only one I cherish. Promise me that nothing will change. Nothing will change. You won't be gone again? You won't leave me alone again? I made you wait a long time. Let's marry right now in this hotel room. Really? We'll toast with this wine and pretend it's our wedding ceremony. Alright. Pour me a glass. Fill it to the top. With this, we our husband and wife. Congratulations. I've never had such wonderful wine before. Let's consummate our marriage now. Get in bed. I'm embarrassed. Turn off the lights. This beautiful face... this beautiful body... I couldn't help but turn away. You, too. Hurry and join me. Jiro... what's wrong? I feel so sleepy... what's happening to me? Please come here and lie down. Jiro, I'm so tired. I feel wonderful... Her heart completely stopped. I had killed Yukiko. And then, to make it appear like a suicide, I used the memos in her handbag to imitate her writing. I wrote a suicide note, then placed her fingerprints on the pen. I was a spy. I am committing suicide. - Yukiko I, too, was a spy. And my heart died, too. Captain Maeda, as of today, you are relieved of your General Staff Office duties. You will be placed under house arrest until further notice. I don't need to explain why. No. I was unaware Yukiko Nunobiki was a spy and I provided her with confidential information. I am prepared to face any punishment. Normally, you would be court-martialed, however, to salvage the General Staff's reputation, you'll likely be sent to the front lines. Prepare to die in battle. Understood. A year has passed since our school first opened its doors. We faced many obstacles, but we finally reached the end. You all worked hard. Chief, it must have been taxing on you, too. No, my efforts can't compare to yours. You carried the weight of the school on your shoulders. I was merely a supporting actor. Your final examination scores were all outstanding. The Army Ministry has finally accepted Nakano as an official school, and we plan to recruit fifty new students next year. It's all thanks to you. My deepest gratitude. Tomorrow, some of you will leave for India, some for South America. Unfortunately, the Second European War has already begun. You won't have neither the time, nor the means, to properly establish yourselves at your destinations. Chief, don't worry about us. We'll bring your vision to life, regardless of what awaits us. Also, you'll be treated hostilely by Japanese ambassadors and military personnel stationed overseas. - It won't be easy. - We'll be fine. We won't fail. In the end, they'll be the ones coming to us begging for help. As the first graduates, our accomplishments will foster Nakano's expansion. We'll fill the world with our school's graduates! Let's do it! Hey, let's cheer for the school. Stand up. Nakano School! Chief Kusanagi! Shiina, are you heading to China? Beijing. You must still be devastated. I intend to put it behind me. Will you visit your mother before leaving? No. She's the type of woman capable of living on her own. I have nothing left to say to you, except this: don't die. Stay alive, no matter what happens. So long. I set fire to Yukiko’s memos. There was nothing left for me in Japan. Three days later, I departed for my mission in China. THE END
