Yes... of course, But there's something out there, it's killed my friends... It's some kind of monster. No... It is the great spirit of the forest. It helps maintain balance. Your 'friends' upset the balance. What...? What do you mean? I remember last year. I know... I'm sorry again, but all my friends... They weren't your friends. You said so. I... You stopped them. They did things to me, Peter. They called me terrible names and they were going to do far worse things. But you stopped them. Pushed them off of me Got me out of there.. And you told me they were not your friends. You were kind. Yes, but... I've lived on the island all my life. I know. My parents they taught me the old ways. They wanted to protect me from outsiders. And now that they're gone, I want more. I don't understand... Danielle, right? Your name, is Danielle. Yes. What do you want? I want us to live together. Here!! I have to go home... I have to tell the police... No. We will live here, Peter. But that beast? It is the spirit of the forest... It must be respected above all else. The spirit and I are in balance. See for yourself. I love you, Peter. I want us to be together. Here. In this place. And if I try to leave? Then you can join your 'friends.'
