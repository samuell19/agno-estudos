How's the boat coming? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hey. Good morning, Abner. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Abner! Hey, how's it going? Hey, Abner! Yeah. Careful, now! This is a two-hand zone. Hey, guys. Check this out! I learned how to do this a couple days ago. - Nice one! - Isn't that sweet? - Whew! - Hey, Pug, do you do anything? - It's easy. - Wait, wait. Here we go. Ready? Hey, here comes Captain Crazy. You need training wheels on that thing? Hey, don't run anybody over, old man! Or get hit by a truck! Nice one, Pug. Ah, God damn it to hell! God, dad! Enjoy the show? Let me help you. - I can manage. - Well, I know you can. But I'm not so sure about the bike. What about it? You could have hurt yourself! What did you come down here for? I wanted to see you. Dad, I think it's time to think about giving up the bike. I already gave up the truck. How am I supposed to get around? I can just plan on coming by and picking you up and driving you wherever you need to be. What is it? 20 miles from the valley? Yeah, but it's not a problem. What does your husband think you ought to do? My husband has a name. That's right. He does. He thinks we should leave you alone. Like the Eskimos do. Did you ever hear the story? Yes, several times, dad. When you're too old to take care of yourself, they put you on an ice floe. And then you just drift out to sea. Doesn't take long. You finally fall asleep from the cold. Nature takes care of the rest. At least you serve some purpose in the food chain. Polar bears would love it! Dad, I'm not going to let you be eaten by a polar bear. Makes more sense than putting people in a hole in the ground with a lot of crying about how much they're going to be missed when they never were before. All right. All right, dad. I admit I don't have the vaguest idea of what would make you happy. Do you think someone like me expects to be happy? Everybody deserves to be happy. Happiness is something you outgrow. Daddy, I don't want you to be alone. What's wrong with that? The bitterness. That's what's wrong with that. Don't you have any faith? You mean religion? It's not for me. You took me to church on Sundays. I took you to see Santa Claus, too. Doesn't mean I believed in him. Don't step on that. Know what? I think it's time to do some shit. Yeah, it's been too peaceful around here. Yeah. I saw that old geezer up by the pile of junk he's building. - Yeah? - There was some witch with him. - What would he do with one? - I think he's her old man. Oh, you know what? Man, they stink. Man, he ought to be in one of those old geezer places. I know. Shouldn't you kids be in school? It's a holiday! Really? Which one? - Support your local cops day. - Didn't you hear? Ooh, he's coming. You know anything about vandalism at the middle school last night? Was there vandalism at the middle school? That sounds bad. What happened? Some punk kids got in and did some serious damage. Well, how do you know it was kids? It could have been anybody... Adults, old people. It's not fair that kids always get the blame. - Yeah. - A big joke, huh? You won't be laughing if we find out you had something to do with it. Maybe we can help you find the ones that did it. We'll talk to that old nut with the boat. Maybe he saw something. But he's probably as blind as a bat. That's what you do on support your law enforcement day. Stay away from him, understand? Oh. Did you hear me? I said stay away! Yes, sir, officer. Enjoy your holiday. You should go get some free donuts down at the shack. You watch yourself! And the rest of you, too. Wise up! Get out of here! Let's go! Let's go! Hey, old man. You call that a boat? - Must be crap! - Bite me! A shame if something happened to it. - Let's bring it down! - Yeah, let's spray paint it! Who are they? Kids from the neighborhood. What do they want? Just to make life miserable. - Whew! - Yeah! Because it won't float! Stay away from that! What are you going to do about it? Yeah, old man. You watch me. - Come on. - Bite me! Dad. Dad, don't. Just... let me call the police. Let them take care of this. No, no, don't call. Why not? They're menacing you. I don't want the police here. You haven't done anything wrong. No, but some people think I have. What did you do? They say it's an eye sore, the boat. Yeah, but it's on your property. Just let it be. Hey, you, lady. They got a junk yard for car wrecks. Why don't you put this thing in a boat wreck yard? Yeah, with him in it. Let's roll, guys. Dad, this is just another reason that I worry about you. I can take care of myself. I got a boat to build. How long has it been since you made any progress on this boat? What do you know about what I've been doing? All you know is I'm not dead yet. I know that you're angry at the world, and you've been taking it out on all of us. That's enough! Do you hear me? Enough! Not another word. What are you going to do? Send me to bed without my supper? Did I ever do that? A few times. Without your supper? Dad, are you remembering to take your medication? I don't know. Daddy, you have to remember to take your pills. It's not important enough to remember taking pills. Okay. Bye, dad. Be careful. - Are you all right? - Yeah. - Is someone chasing you? - Yeah, on bikes. Do you want some help? No. Call me, dad. Okay? I'll leave a message. What are you standing here for? I was trying to get away from those kids. What do they do to you? They're trying to pants me. They were trying to put pants on you? No, no, no. Take them off then throw them up a tree. Why would they do that? I don't know. They think it's funny, I guess. I don't. Did your parents send you to spy on me? I don't have parents. Not real ones. You're an orphan? A bastard. Where'd you learn to talk like that? Hey! It's not a bad word. - Says who? - My uncle. I heard him say it since he never had a father. Everybody has a father some time. Jesus didn't. Ha! Jesus. Do you have a father? No! Are you a bastard? Well... That depends on who you ask. Maybe your father's with my mom. How do you figure that? Well, did he die? What do you think? If he was still here, he'd be 115 years old. That's old. Tell me about it. My mom's up there in Heaven. She sees everything I do. So I can't cuss or get in trouble in school. She sees it all. Hears everything I say. Who told you that? My uncle. This uncle of yours, is he a preacher? A lawyer. Just as bad. What's that? It's a boat, a sailing sloop. Did those kids dare you to come down here and get Captain Crazy's goat? That's what they call me. You know that? Yeah. I heard them. Uh-huh. I bet you did. They killed Max. Who's that? He was my dog. He's probably up there with your mom now. Why'd they do that? How should I know? Maybe they killed him because he was getting old. Did they shoot him? Rat poison in his food. Do you know what that does to an animal? They couldn't just let him not wake up one morning. Yeah, that's what my mom did. She just stayed asleep one day. You going to work on the boat today? Oh, maybe I will before the storm starts. Do you think I could ever help you? Help me? What makes you think you can work on something like this? Do you know what this is? You know where to use it? It's for rigging the mast. Do you even know where that is? Sorry I made you mad. Damn it, I'm not mad. I said I'm not mad! Poor little bastard. Jesus. That's it? Yeah, it's a sailing sloop. It's a pile of junk. Looks like something that didn't finish falling down. The man who lives in that house, he's working on it. It's going to have sails so it can go across the ocean. Why not wings too? It's a boat. Just sails. How'd you meet this man, Ricky? I ran into his yard by accident. What do you mean by accident? Some kids were chasing me. Oh, no. Again? Ricky, you can't just go running into some old man's yard. It's dangerous! Not as dangerous as not running in. I don't know. You got to start trying to make friends here, man. It'll help. Where do you find friends? Sometimes I think that blank stare of yours is just an act. You're not really that vacant. Listen, Ricky. You know, when your mom was sick, her biggest concern wasn't herself. It was you. And your aunt Jean and I made her a promise that we'd look out for you, make sure you were safe and happy. When those foster families didn't work out, we've been doing everything we can to keep that promise. But you have to help us make this work. You understand? I guess. All right. Come on. We're going to... Come on. We should get out of here. Want the special today, Abner? What is it? Same as it was yesterday. - And every day. - Yeah. Then why do they call it the special? Because it's so special the way mo cooks it and I serve it. I guess I'll have the special today. How's the boat coming, Abner? Like the special. How's that? It doesn't change. How long you been working on it? Since he heard about the flood coming. What flood? The big one. Only his name isn't Noah. No joking, Abner. When you finish building that boat, what are you going to do with it? I'm going to get on it and sail off. Where to? Some place where people don't ask so many questions. You don't have to get so touchy about it. We care about you, even if you get a little grumpy. Leave the man alone. That's a pretty good idea. Seriously, Abner. Where you going to take it? Across the Pacific. To where? No place in particular. How do you plot a course for that? You don't. You got to have a destination. I do. But you're gonna keep it a secret from your friends. From myself too. Sounds to me like an escape. From what? From us. I'll drink to that. Well, we'd miss you, Abner. But I doubt he'd miss you. Hey, now. That's no way to get me into bed. Hi! That's him. The man who's building the boat. Are you still mad at me? Ricky, leave him alone. I told you. I'm not mad. Just busy. This is my uncle Charles. Oh, the boy tells me he likes to work with his hands. Oh, yeah. Well, he actually is interested in tools. - You... still want to help me? - Yeah. - It can be tricky work. - Ricky, I really don't think you should be climbing up on this... On this... 26-foot sloop. Oh. I'm sorry. It doesn't look like something a boy his age should be climbing on. I don't figure on letting him to do any climbing for now. If he helps me, he stays on the ground. Maybe passing me things, at least until he gets his legs. You know what? We can talk about this at home. - We should get going. - Can I stay just for a little? Ricky, you can't hang around bothering the man. If he wants to stay, it's okay by me. I really don't want him getting in the way or hurt. Not much chance of that. He tells me his mother's watching him. God, too. No way he's going to get in trouble with an audience like that. I want you home in 30 minutes. We just came back from the doctor, you know, at this place. It looks like a hospital or maybe a school. A home? No. There aren't any mothers or fathers there, just doctors and nurses, I think. Sounds familiar. You been there? To another one. A place for kids. - People like me. - People that build boats? That make other people uncomfortable. How do they do that? It's easy. Nobody knows what to do with people like me. So they put us some place where we're out of sight, where they don't have to see us. Storage. Why? They say it's best for you except they forget to ask if you think it is. Yeah. That's how my uncle is. He only wants what's best for me, says I have problems. And he doesn't? Guess not. What would happen to your boat if you went to one of those places? Well, it wouldn't get built. It would just stand there until the wind and the sand and the sea eat it away. Just be a heap of wood in the sand. I wouldn't want that to happen. It won't. I'm not going to a home. There's just one place I'm going. Out there dead or alive. That's where I'm headed. How can you go there if you're dead? There you go asking me a lot of questions again. Sorry. It's just hard to answer some of them. Would you sink to the bottom if you were dead in the ocean? - You want to help me or not? - Yeah. Then come over here and hold the ladder for me. Right. Put one foot on the bottom rung and hold the sides steady. All right. You holding tight? - Real tight. - All right. Now, don't let go of anything. I won't. Hand me that pail of waterproofing on the ground. How can I do that? What do you mean how? I can't let go of the ladder. Is that supposed to be funny? No. You're right. It's not. Just let go enough with one hand and pick up the pail. Careful. Don't spill it. I don't think your uncle would like to see you with a waterproofed head. This stuff doesn't come off. - Ever? - Uh-uh. You'll go around looking like a bowsprit the rest of your life. What's that? It's the front, near the bow, going through the air. In the old days, they used to put wooden sculptures, usually women there. But I guess you can put a kid on it. What color is the boat going to be? It's going to be white on the hull. The hull is the bottom part that rides in the water. The sails will be white, too. The deck, a good dark mahogany. And the gunnels, they'll be black. Is that where the guns go? The gunnels are the top edge of the top of the hull. Goes all the way around. No guns. Sailboats used to have guns in the olden days. Cannons. That they did. It was serious business sailing on them. If you stepped out of line, ah, you got keel hulled. Sounds bad. Keel hulling. What was it? It was punishment for getting the ship in danger. They'd tie the line to your hands and one to your feet and then they'd toss you overboard in the cold, black sea. The crew on one side would pull the line in. On the other side, they'd hold the line tight to keep the poor devil against the keel. It was covered with barnacles. Crusty little creatures that were as sharp as broken glass. Does that make the man die? Oh, not usually. Just turn his back into raw hamburger. He'd do some serious praying. Mates on deck didn't take their time pulling him around and up. If they did, he could drown. That's a really scary story. I can tell you've never been to sea. My mom took me once on a big boat out in the ocean. No sails on it, though. Catalina? I think so. Well, that's a start, a ferry ride. They have to follow rules there, too. If they don't, they'll get keel hulled? Ha! I doubt there's ever been a hulling on the Catalina ferry. Give me a hand here. It might not be such a bad idea, though. Yeah, maybe for those kids that chased me into your yard. Sure. Keel hull 'em for taking your pants. And calling you names. When did you tell him to come home? I said half an hour. Isn't he overdue? You know how he is with time like everything else. You think he's all right? I certainly hope so. When's supper? We're waiting for Ricky to come home. That figures. That's what we're always doing. Never mind, Donny. He'll be home pretty soon. He better be. Peter's coming over after we eat. Oh yeah? And what are you guys doing that can't wait. Peter has the new aliens game. Oh, no, no. Isn't that rated m? His parents didn't have a problem with it. But we do. Why? For one thing, I don't want Ricky to watch it. Oh, don't worry. I didn't invite him. We'll talk about that later, and don't speak to your mother that way. - What way? - You know what I'm talking about. Yeah, sure. We shouldn't do anything that might bother poor little Ricky. Yeah, okay. That's what I'm talking about. Just stop it! You know, he's right. We always have to walk on egg shells all the time worrying about what we say in front of Ricky. Don't do this. He might not understand. Don't say that. It might hurt his feelings. Do you ever stop to think what that boy's been through since his mother died? Three foster homes before we took him in. Besides, don't we get paid to take him in anyway? To help with expenses for another member of this household! But I don't like what you're implying, as if we're only interested in a little money? Okay. I didn't mean it that way. Ruth, you have to realize that there was no place else to go. And at least here he's with his own family. And I know it's not easy for you kids to accept that. But the least we can do is try to make him feel like he belongs. Even if he doesn't? Ruthie. What's it like on the ocean? I mean, you're far away from everything. You have to pay attention to everything around you. When the wind picks up, you see the white caps building, the seas tell you twin sails. Reach in and take the swells from the corner. When the waves break over the bow, you take down the jib and secure the boom. Those are orders you have to obey or it'll be a lot worse than the keel haul. Does it ever get nice? The ocean? Uh-huh, when it's getting ready after a long storm, a calmness can set in just as quick as the foul weather dropped down. The clouds break open to a blue view I haven't seen for days. Water settles into a smooth flow. A little later, the sky turns orange and the sun gets bigger, looks on fire. Then, it slips down over the edge of the sea until just before it's gone a flare pops, a bright green circle. Yeah, before things go dark... Like it's starting to now. Looks like someone out there heard you and made it happen. Well, maybe they did. What happens next? Well, you sit down for supper and start counting the stars. But you don't get far. There are millions. You sit back and figure you done all right for another day. And you're free. That's what you are. Yeah, free. That's what I want to be. Maybe on a boat out in the ocean. I think your half an hour has been over for a while. Your uncle and aunt are probably wondering where you are. I'd better get going. Wait until they hear what you taught me. It might not be what they want to hear. Thank you. For what? For letting me help and the stories. I couldn't do it. I'm sorry! I tried! I'm sorry! I tried! Ricky, wake up. Wake up. Ricky, wake up. It's all right, man. You're having a dream. I was? It was so real. I was in the ocean! No, you're safe in bed. What was that you were yelling about dropping the sails and reefing something? We were on the boat. - Who? - Me and the captain. So, that's it. A real bad storm, and I fell off. I should have known better then to let you hang around that old man. It wasn't his fault. It was a really, really, horrible, horrible storm. Now you're not just hanging around his place, it's giving you nightmares. You know what, Ricky? Your aunt Jean and I have to have another talk with you tomorrow. What about? About the kind of trouble you could be getting into. It wasn't trouble! Just a dream! I'm not talking about a dream. Look, we'll discuss it tomorrow. Good night. Uncle Charles. What is it? I learned about waterproofing a hull today. Good night, Ricky. So, where are they? Seeing some doctor. A shrink at a home for kids. What's that about? It's about Ricky. What else is it ever about? You think they're saying we're not being fair to him? Probably. It's never his fault, is it? Mom told me he came home feeling good about something yesterday. He met this old man who's building a boat. The old fart down by the beach? That's just great. Every kid in town hates that guy. Why? He's just weird. That stupid pile of junk he calls a boat. That's no reason for kids to hate him. I think he's crazy. He hasn't done anything wrong. Why can't everyone just leave him alone? I just think the faster Ricky's out of here the better off we're all gonna be. Why do you think he's going to get out? I heard dad telling mom that he's too destructive. Of what? Of everything! He complains that we don't like him, don't want him around. - Do you want him around? - No, I don't! It was pretty good around here until he came along. Maybe we should give him another chance. I just hope they put that little freak in a home, and we're out of it all. You know something? He's not the real freak of this house! You are! - Ow! - Take it back! Ow! Quit it! - Take it back! - Quit it! - Let me up! - Take it back! - I can't breathe! - Hey! Hey, hey, hey! What's going on here? Let her up! You all right? Tell them about your friends, the ones who ride around on their bikes and think they're some big tough motorcycle gang. They're always after Ricky. They brag about pantsing him and call him the little bastard. Why don't you shut up?! You don't know what you're talking about. All right, that's enough! Is there any truth to this? It's just talk. No, it isn't. Well, Donny? Don't ask me. Is it true, Ruth? I heard Donny talking to his friend Peter on the phone laughing about it. All right, you listen to me. I'm only going to ask you this once, Donny. Did you have anything to do with this? No. I swear, I didn't. He didn't. Do you know who these kids are? I don't know their names, but they ride around on bikes trying to make people feel bad. And they laugh a lot about it. It's not just me. They do it to the captain, too. But I don't want them to think that I'm telling on them. - It'd just be worse. - They're not going to know, Ricky. - It's okay. - Unless somebody here lets them know. Don't look at me. I'm not going to say anything. Well, see to it that you don't. We're sorry, Ricky. It's very unfair what those boys are doing and so is the kind of thing Donny's been saying. And you know we don't feel that way about you, right? Well, we don't, Ricky. And we won't tolerate it. Even calling me a bastard? I... I'm sorry, man. Yeah, even that. How come your uncle's not with you? He's talking to my aunt at home about that place they want to send me. Well, I guess you should be glad people are doing what's best for you. I suppose. But I really don't want to go to any place. I don't care if it's best for me. Maybe they won't make me go if I behave better, stop making trouble. Are you making trouble? Then how are you going to stop doing something you're not doing in the first place? I don't know. I guess I'm just going to have to make them believe me. That's an idea. Maybe if I can make my daughter think I'm not really doing things she thinks I'm doing that I never did in the first place she'll stop trying to put me away. I guess. Feel that breeze picking up? Here it comes. We better get moving. Yeah, we better get to work. Come on, you're going up there with me today. Maybe start getting some sea legs. It's about time. Yes! Come on. Let's go. The old geezer's not around. Yeah, he did some work on the thing. Gives us more to decorate. What if he sees us? - Big deal. - Who cares? Ever see him walk? Come on guys, let's go. Ready? One, two, three! Yeah! Grab it, now pull! Hard! I think he missed something here. Ha-ha! Now that is art. Hey, guys. Check this out! Don't! What are you doing here, you little piece of crap! I heard you guys go to my house saying something about the boat! Just mind your own business - if you know what's goddamn good for you! -Yeah! I'm gonna go get him and tell him what you guys are doing! Guess you want the same thing we just did to that old geezer's boat! Yeah! Go, Pug! Let me go! Get off me! He never did anything to you, and I didn't either! - Come on, Pug. - Give me the paint. - Let's go, Pug. - Yeah, spray him! Yeah! Spray right in his face! Quit it? And if we don't? I'll kick all your asses one at a time, and I mean it! Don't let him do that to you! - Get back up! - Come on, Pug. Yeah, get him! You little punk! You'll pay for that! What's going on out there? If you say anything to him about us, you'll get a lot worse than this. We'll light the whole goddamn scow on fire! His house, too! And yours for good measure. Come on, guys before he calls the cops! Let's go. Come on! Go, go, go, go, go! Hey guys, wait up! It's you. What are you doing here this time of night? What do you got all over yourself? You did this? Don't tell me you didn't! You got the paint all over yourself. I swear! I didn't! Don't lie! If you didn't do it, then who did? I can't tell you! Of course, you can't! Because there's nothing to tell! You wanted to help me! You wanted to learn how to use your hands! Well, you learned how to use them, all right! Ricky? What are you doing here? Just take a look! Good God. You did this? I swear! I didn't! I saw some kids doing it! I tried to stop them, but I couldn't! What kids? Those bad kids on bikes! Tell me the truth. It'll only get worse if you don't. He's got the paint! Ha! All over him! The kids put it on me! I'm calling the police. I really wish you wouldn't. Why is that? Look, I know you're upset. I would be, too. But, please, let me take care of this. And how are you going to do that? I'll see that everything is repaired. Any costs to do it, I'll make good on that. You're going to take care of this with money? What do you want me to do, beat him? What I want you to do... What I want him to do is leave me alone! Everybody! Stay off my property! Stay away from my boat! Just let me do what I want to do! Just leave me alone. Come on, Ricky, let's go home. You have three new messages. Message one. Dad, I'm sorry. I worry about you. Okay. I'll see you later. Message two. Look, dad. Call me. Message three. Call me, dad. End of messages. All this stuff, all these pictures. Yeah. She's going to be a pretty nice boat. Yeah. And I ain't leaving you behind. I promise you. Ah, oh yeah. You were so beautiful. That cancer was the monster... Tore you apart, but you never complained. You just worried about me. Well... Better get out there and see where the weather is going. Not going to get much work done today. Hi, Abner. What are you doing here? Katherine baked you a cake. She says it's your favorite. Upside down cake. Her mother used to make it. Could we just sit down for a minute? I've got work to do. Yeah, well that's kind of what I wanted to talk to you about. Abner, do you think maybe it's time to call it quits on this? I'm going to sea no matter what, even if I drop dead. And if I do, you know who's going to get me there? Your wife. What are you talking about? She's going to gather up my ashes, put them in a jar, stand out in the end of the pier... And let me fly. Excuse me. Hello? What are you doing here? I didn't do it. You've got to believe me! I should believe you? Just because you got paint in your hair? He's telling the truth. And who might you be? I'm Ruth, his cousin. He lives with our family. I heard my brother, Donny, on the phone last night. Ricky tried to stop them. That's why they did that to his hair. I just wanted you to know. You shouldn't blame Ricky. What does your father think about all this? I can tell he's pretty unhappy. He's not alone. He just wants to help. Give him a chance. Okay, Abner. Got to go. Thanks for the cake. See you later. What's going on with you? I think I'm getting sent to that place with the doctors and stuff. The thing that happened to the boat last night... My uncle says it was the last straw, that I needed to go and see someone for my problems. Sure. You got problems. Just shove them off to somebody else. Right? What are you going to do? I don't know. Maybe run away. Would it be all that bad to go to this place? Yeah. If it's anything like the place I had to go before my aunt and uncle got me. A home? No. It was a farm for kids. The kids were pretty bad. Some of them were in gangs. Sounds familiar. Did they ride around on bikes? No, but they did pretty scary stuff to other kids. What kind of stuff? One night these kids in a gang got me out of bed and took me to this barn. You ready to run with the wolves like we do? I don't know. There's only one way to find out, isn't there? Say hello to Wolf. He's part dog and part wolf, mostly wolf. He's going to be watching over you tonight just to make sure you don't go anywhere that wouldn't be safe. He'd be pretty upset if you left him all by himself. Show us what you're made of. Because you wouldn't want to make Wolfie angry now, would you? We'll see you tomorrow. Won't we? I don't want to go anyplace else. I can't. I won't! What do you want to do? Help you finish the boat. Why? Because that's what friends do. We're friends? You already have one? Well, I guess maybe I don't. They're hard to find. I don't have one either. Never have. You should have one. Someone your age. How about someone your age? There you go... Asking questions again. If you want to help me, don't ask so many questions, especially questions I can't answer. I don't imagine you've ever laid deck plank. Not many people have. You know what a deck is? Yeah. The floor on a boat. Houses have floors. Boats have decks and bulkheads. You know what a bulkhead is? A wall? No windows either. Hatches and ports. Now, instead of wasting any more of my time, why don't you hand me a couple of those boards there? That's it. You know your left from your right? Yeah. Well, you can forget about them at sea because there's port and starboard. Port is left. Starboard is right. Think you can remember all that? No floors, decks. Bulkheads and not walls. No doors or windows. Hatches and port and starwood. Good enough. Starboard. You think you can drill holes for rivets? Where did you learn how to do that? I like doing things with my hands. Good morning. Not interested. Are you the occupant of this property? I'm not an occupant. I own this property. You happen to be on it without an invitation. I'm not buying anything. I'm not selling anything. I'm a county inspector. Zoning department. Is that so? We received a complaint. Well, what about? This construction you're doing. What about it? It's nonconforming. You're damn right it's not. It doesn't conform to anything. I don't either. What you're doing isn't allowed. This neighborhood is zoned residential. The only construction allowed is an addition to a residence with proper permits. I didn't find any permits filed. I don't expect you would. The law is very clear. Commercial activity is prohibited on property zoned R-Zero. Said activity includes manufacturing, repair of maintenance, machinery of vehicles, warehousing or construction of trailers, aircrafts, and boats. Are you telling me that I can't build something for my own use on my own private property? Look, I'm just doing my job. And that's what I'm doing. My job. You're holding me and my helper here up with all the double talk. I'm sorry, but I've got to act on a complaint. Who's making the complaint? I can't say. It came from the neighborhood. Isn't that neighborly. Who are these people? Maybe they don't like the looks of each other anymore or they're mad about their jobs or their taxes. Here's something to take their minds off things. Call an inspector and complain about some crazy old son of a bitch who just wants to live in peace, to hear the beat of the tide on his boat. I don't know who's behind it. I just know what my job is. I'm leaving you a notice to cease and desist nonconforming activity. And if I don't? Then the county will come in with a bulldozer and do it for you. Two weeks. I'm sorry. I suppose I give in, just sign the documents and surrender up there on the deck like they do at the end of a war and hand them my sword. Don't do that! Got any better ideas? Finish the boat before that man comes back. Finish it? In two weeks? You must think you're pretty good with that hammer. You are! Not that good. After the deck's on, the hatches have to be set, steering hardware. None of it's in yet. Three coats of paint, varnish. The mast is not even in yet. Rigging. 14 days? You've got big ideas. There's nights, too! You think your uncle and aunt are going to let you come out at night? I can get out on my own. There's not enough time. They'll come with the bulldozer! Over my dead body. Yeah. Over mine, too! Now, can I have some more rivets? What for? We're not going to get anything done asking a whole lot of questions now, are we? Here's a whole pail. A tried and true captain. Well, we'll see about that. Go all the way down. There you go. - Yeah! - Whew! Yeah! Guess who's back? Are you buying that thing? No. I'm not buying it. You going to go fishing in it or something? No fishing. Captain Crazy will have a real shit fit if he sees you poking around that thing. Do you boys have some business here? Maybe we do. Maybe we don't. Who's asking? Zoning enforcement department. Yeah, I heard somebody complained about Captain Crazy's stupid boat. And now it's going to be torn down. You kids have no idea what's being done here. Just in a short time, he's repainted, finished the wood work, even fixed the broken rudder that some gang of rotten kids tried to smash. But you wouldn't know anything about that, would you? Don't look at us. I am looking at you. Why don't you go bother somebody else? It's a free country. Yeah. Free. Hey, guys, maybe we should have a good-bye party for old Captain Crazy. Hey, Schmidt! That's right. I know your name. Be careful. Hey, guys. Let's go. See you at the demolition derby. Beautiful thing, eh? I think we got a boat here. Yeah. We've got a boat. Let's check her out. That a boy. 14 days. All she needs now is a brisk off-shore breeze and a name. How do you name a boat? You want a name that brings you luck. Memories to think about when you're away from port. Got any ideas? Could you name a boat "Mom"? Yeah, yeah, you could. I had one idea I don't think you'll find on anybody's transom. Do you know how to spell it? Yeah, I do. Take a look. Now we got a boat, and we got a name for a boat. Pretty good for a carpenter. My uncle says Jesus was a carpenter. Oh, let's not go there right now. So, we have a little mass heading west, southwest past the Farallon Islands, due west riding a steady wind coming over the port quarter. - On the left side. - Right. No. I'm pretty sure it's the left. When does it go into the water? About an hour before day break, I figure, when the tide breaks. How does it go to the water? You see those... you see those wheels under the keel there? You hitch it up, pull it around the bend over there, wait for the tide to come up, get it placed, unhook it and out it goes. Where? A place you've never been before. Some place you've never seen. Maybe me neither. Is it an island? Might be. Is it on the map? Might be. Are there people on it? I hope not. What do you do there? Mostly what you want and not what you don't want. How far is it? Hard to say. Maybe 3,000 miles. I want to go to sea, too. Can't do that. Didn't I do a good job? No, you did a great job. You don't understand where I'm headed. Yeah, thousands of miles away. The ocean is enormous. Bigger than anything you can imagine. Just going to be a loose speckle, like a grain of sand on this beach. Maybe I'll have enough food and water to last until landfall. Maybe I won't. The storms that can send me to the bottom, where there are sharks. I may never see you again. Maybe you will. There's some things you got to do alone. You'll learn that someday. This is Helen Grant at the beach where a troubling story is developing. Abner Green, who had been building a boat that was vandalized and nearly destroyed by a gang of juveniles, was served with an order from the county to remove or tear down the vessel. Now, Green refused to obey the order, and a bulldozer arrived about an hour ago to dispose of the boat. But the vessel, a sailing swoop, we're told, along with Green is gone. It appears the elderly and determined man may have actually launched the boat and put out to sea. - Whoa. - It's not there anymore. It's actually gone. Now, at this moment, coast guard helicopters are searching offshore, but there seems to be no trace of the boat, which we've been told is named the Little Bastard. Now, the man's son-in-law is right here. Excuse me, sir, could you tell me, do you have any idea what happened to your father-in-law? He obviously launched his boat. Well, are you concerned for his safety? Are we concerned? A man in his late 70s alone on the open ocean in a homemade boat, never been in the water. Wouldn't you be concerned? Is it even seaworthy? I honestly don't know. So, we've been told that Mr. Green is a retired merchant seaman. Yes. He was a captain. Do you know when he left? My wife and I imagine during the night. High tide was at 4:45. So that means he's been gone at least about eight hours. Could you tell us do you know how far he could get? It depends. If he'd have a brisk wind behind him, he could be well past the Farallon Islands, if he went in that direction. Were you planning on demolishing the boat? It was ordered by the county. Why do you think a man of his age would do something like this? Because he couldn't deal with all the people who refused to leave him alone. And who were they? His neighbors, courts, all of us. If you could speak to Mr. Green right... Captain Green. If you could speak to Captain Green right now, what would you want to say to him? I'd say... Sail it, Abner. Sail it well. Helen Grant for News Center 1. How could your wife do this to her own father? She had no choice. She had to do the right thing. She was just desperate to save him. She couldn't let things be. She had to get people to sign a petition to the county. Look what's happened now to a harmless old man. You don't understand. He can't survive out there alone. Tough story. Sad story. You're not going soft on us, are you? - I think I am. - Why? Because I've got a father, too. As the story of an elderly man alone at sea unfolds, the chances of finding him continue to diminish. With each passing hour, authorities seem less confident that they will be able to locate the man and his homemade boat. It's a sloop. We asked Commander Jerome Craft of the San Francisco Coast Guard Station what he thinks the lone sailor's chances are. His response, "We can only hope." What? What are you doing here? You stowed away on me? You stowed away on me! Just stay right there! I want to see what kind of a mess you made down below. What do you think you're doing? What's this? Sorry. Are you're going to keel haul me? I'm thinking about it. Just hold that straight, now. Don't get fancy on me. Never thought I'd be doing this. What am I supposed to do with you? I could be your first mate. Just... just hold it there a second. All right, close your eyes. Close 'em! That a boy. There. Take it off, look at it. You want to be first mate? That's a first mate's hat. There you go. You are something else. You got to go starboard to the right, starboard. No, no, no, no, no, no! Pull it this way. Starboard is right. If you go right, you gotta pull left. Little more, little more. There you go. All right. You're sailing now, aren't you?
