Now, they're gonna be out there cleaning up for the next several days, folks. The governor has declared a state of emergency as we expect heavy flooding and high winds throughout the night. Local authorities are urging everyone to stay inside. For more details on the impact on the ground, let's throw it over to Mia in the newsroom. - Mia. - Thank you, Tom. The National Weather Service has confirmed a category 3 at landfall with sustained winds of 100 miles per hour and gusts up to 130 in some areas of Jefferies County, in addition to widespread power outages. Emergency services are expecting extensive damage over the next eight hours. And we're getting reports of closures of parts of Interstate 84, 95, and the Merritt. You know what? Why don't you just stay off the roads entirely? I don't know how long we're gonna be able to stay on the air. Keep yourself safe inside and just get through the night. God damn, Jesus Christ! Come on, close the door. Get on in here. Ern, you got the first-aid kit? What all you do this time? Tried to swat the motherfucker, but he disappeared. Just my luck. Was it that raccoon again? That little dumpster bitch! Well, I don't know, this thing was flyin'. - I don't know what it was. - Flying? Huh. That's not good. God damn. You should uh... you should really get that checked out. If it was flying, it might've been a... - I'm fine, I'm fine. - You feel hot? - Uh, headachey? - No, nothing. 'Cause if it was flying, it might have been a bat. And if you got bit by a bat, you could have rabies. You alright? I'm not good with these. Why don't you let me get you to a doctor? There's that walk-in a few miles out. You know, we couldn't even if I wanted to. Tree fell down halfway up the access road, it took out all the streetlights. I had to walk the rest of the way here. I got a big truck. Whatever it is, it's gonna have to wait until sunrise. Never missed a show. Not gonna start now. Bob wants to see you in his office. He did not. - You're kidding. - Hand to God, sweetheart. Hand to God. - I can't believe... - Amazing. Uh, Amy, come in. Come in. Cutting it kind of close, don't you think? Have you looked out the window? Can't say I have. Got too good a view right here. Stop it, Robert. Please, sweetheart, call me "Bob". - Bob. - Robert. Amy, this is Sienna Walker. She's from... UC Berkeley. I just finished up my Master's and I came home to take care of mom. Um... I grew up listening to you. I'm a big fan. - Nice. - Yeah. She's gonna be your shadow tonight. Make sure you show her the ropes. I... I don't wanna impose, or... Oh, nonsense. She'd love to. I'm sorry, what are you? Well, I'm coming on as a sub. Mr. Collins came in on... - Bob. - Bob... Came on Career Day when I was a senior at Carrigan, and he gave me his card, and told me to reach out when I entered the real world, so... Here I am. Lovely. Yeah, it really is. You know, it's a scary time, so it's just nice to have somebody there while you're transitioning. Well, what can I say? I've made a career... nay, a life out of seeing things in people. - Like I did with you, Amy. - Hmm. It's my gift. If you'll excuse me, I'm gonna head to the ladies' room freshen up. Good idea, Amy, why don't you tag along? You're looking a touch pale. That's alright, thanks. I just have a face for radio. Oh, stop! You're beautiful. And you've got a show in a few minutes, so... - You're fucking her. - Amy! Oh, come on! I remember being her age. Do you? It was a while ago. Cut the bullshit. The fact that you have that perception of me is fra... Oh, please, Robert! Late-night office rendezvous, brandies, vinyl. "Call me 'Bob'." Nothing ever changes with you. Oh, come on, Amy. It's all harmless flirtation. It wasn't then and it's not now. You loved it when it was your turn. Play nice. You have a show. You know, that's what I like about you, Amy. You do your shit old school. When did all this become old school? Decade ago. At least. Go to hell. Pickin' up out there, yeah? Hmm. Never seen a storm this bad. We're stuck in here for the night. Fine by me. Got nowhere to be. What about that girl? Which one? The redhead. Which one? You just met her! And she's gone. Long gone. They come and they go. Hey, I just know what I like. What do we think of the new chick? Who you talkin' about? Bob's new piece of ass? Somebody else thinks it, too! I mean, Amy, you gotta be blind as a bat to not see that shit. She does have credentials, though. Yeah. But she's no Amy Marlowe. You alright, Ames? Mm, I just didn't have dinner tonight. You want a bite? - Garlic noodle. - Blagh. Doesn't sit well with me. Goddammit! You still got your sweet tooth, yeah? You wanna start with call-ins tonight? - Call-ins? - Yeah. We haven't done that in years. Thought it might be nice to revive a classic. Any reason why? Always was my favorite part of the show. My mom used to play the radio while I fell asleep and usually she'd turn it off once I conked out, but sometimes she'd forget. And I'd wake up and there you were. You know, whenever I heard your voice, I knew it was so far past my bedtime. It felt like I was gettin' away with something. Why the sudden nostalgia? You know, I actually called you once. - No. - Yeah. I must've been 8 or 9 years old. Topic of discussion... Dealing with change. What the hell does a 9-year-old know about dealing with change, yeah? I'd say a lot. Yeah. That's what you said then, too. What else did I say to you? Uh, incoming. It's been really great working with you, Amy. I'm so sorry. Um, where do you want me? Oh, the fuck out of my studio. - Uh, sorry? - Uh, you can sit there. You know Aaron. - Hi. - Yeah. Uh, 90 seconds, Amy. You know, I've got to say it is such an honor to watch you do your show tonight. Uh, are you alright? - Fuck. - Jesus, what happened? Oh. Oh. - Jesus! - Fuck. Hey, um, if you... if you need a minute, I can cover the beginning of the show. Yeah, you would love that, wouldn't you? What? Um, no. I mean I think you're really bleeding. - No, I'm fine! - It's bad. I'm fine, okay? And look, I'm just gonna say it, alright? You and Bob... Listen, when I first started here, okay... I know. I didn't realize it then, but... Look, I know what you're trying to do, but... You don't realize it now. You've got blinders on, that's all I'm saying. I'm not stupid. I know you're not stupid, Miss UC Berkeley. I'm just trying to give you some perspective, okay? Because when I was your age... My age? AMY Yes, when I was your age, I made a lot of mistakes. And I'm just here to tell you it's really not worth your while. Do you honestly think I'm bangin' Bob? Look, you may have had to sleep with him in order to lock down this job, but I only had to make him think that I wanted to. You are such a little girl. You really hate that, don't you? 10 seconds, Amy. You swan into my studio and don't think you own it. Here's the tea, Amy. I am the one who convinced Bob to give you one last show. As a courtesy. I mean, you were really never my cup of kombucha, but my parents always really did have such a soft spot for you, so... ...at... - 10 Minutes to Midnight. - You're welcome. ♪ 10 minutes ♪ ♪ 10 minutes to midnight ♪ ♪ 10 minutes to midnight ♪ And it's 10 Minutes to Midnight. I'm Amy Marlowe. Keep breathing, Ames. You know, storms like this, they always make me a little introspective and I thought tonight I'd like to bring back an old favorite, "Ask Amy". If you're meeting some challenges, if you need a little guidance, give us a call. 509-152-WLST. Now, before those lines start lighting up, I want you to meet my co-host for the night, Sienna Walters! Walker, hi. Sienna is a recent graduate of UC Berkeley and she's here to take my job. Line 1. Hello, caller. What's your problem? Oh, uh, hi. I... I just dumped my girlfriend, but... Aw! CALLER 1: I'm having second thoughts. Sounds like it's on you, caller. What? - No, lo... look... - Yeah. You're having some arguments, and a dry spell... Some troubles. And irreconcilable differences. We were just arguing. I tell you what, let's get Sienna's hot take. Who? Come on, speak up. Use your radio voice. Uh... I think I need more details. I think it's pretty cut and dry. Come on, are you serious right now? Really, caller. I think you're overcomplicating things. Aaron, patch the next one through. Wait, wait... I'm a little nervous. Oh, don't be nervous. It's just your old Auntie Amy. What's your issue? Well, I've just been a listener for the longest time, Amy... And you wanted to call and tell me how much the show means to you. Yeah. And how your pathetic little townie life wouldn't have any significance without me? Huh? - Am I close? - What? Next! You know, caller number 3, I wanna do something a little different with you. - Uh... - Okay? I'm gonna ask you the question. Now, if you had a time machine, and you could go back and do it all again, would you? Well, actually, Amy... Because I haven't gotten up with the sun - for the last 30 years. - Great. And what the fuck has it gotten me? What's my prize? I'm sitting in a dilapidated studio with Sienna fucking Walker. I could be your mother! I mean I was in my 20s when you were born, for God's sakes! I wouldn't even have been a teen mom, I would've been a real mom! I... I really think that uh, we... - You think. - We could take a break. I'm glad you think. It's important you think, because that means you're not just legs and tits. Amy, relax. That whole idea has just bathed me in relief. I don't actually think that that's... But you know what? You're absolutely right. You're right. It is not about us, it is about the caller. And if there's one takeaway for you tonight, caller, it's gonna be this. Oh, that's good, Amy, just relax. At the end of the day, your career... nay your entire fucking life is based solely on the mercurial tastes of a single unqualified fucking executive... Okay. And that, as Sienna Walker would say, is the tea. Goodnight. Good luck. Goodbye. What the fuck was that? What the fuck is this? This is exactly the reason. - This is it. - Spare me the bullshit! Three decades, not one meltdown, not one slip-up! - I actually think... - You can go the fuck to hell! ...misunderstanding. Out of all the interns that you've had coming in and out of this place the whole time, she must lick your balls just right. Amy! You need to teach me your technique, because that's something I'm gonna need when I'm on the hunt tomorrow! Amy, I have nothing but respect for you and... Amy, alright. You... you suck my asshole, you fucking cunt! Amy, come on! Come on! Amy, I... Amy. Are you alright? What happened? Let me see, let me see. Come on, let me see. Oh God. Oh God. I'll... I... I'll be right back. I'm getting first-aid. Amy, why don't you tag along? You're looking a touch pale. Pale. Why? That's not good. You alright, Ames? Mm, I just didn't have dinner tonight. Oh fuck. Amy? Amy. Amy. Amy. A word in my office when you get a moment? Bit of a pickle, huh, Amy? I don't know what came over me. I've been doing this for a long time, but I have to say I've never seen anyone literally try to bite someone's head off. It was batshit crazy, I know. How do you think I should play this? Seriously, Amy, what would you do if you were in my position? Fire me. It was always gonna end this way. How do you mean? I was hired to get fired. It's radio. Well... If you knew all that, Amy, then why make such a fuss? We had such a nice little sunrise farewell party planned. Red velvet cake. Your favorite. So how do you see this playing out? Oh, that is the question, isn't it, Amy? 30 years. My reputation. Gone. In an instant. Does that scare you, Amy? Sunrise? Well, as fate would have it, solar flares have had us grappling with intermittent dead air for the better part of the day, including now. So luckily for you, most listeners missed the latter half of your little tirade. We anticipate having you back on the air within the hour. Of course, there's still the matter of the savage assault on Miss Walker. A matter that I'm certain is weighing on you quite heavily. And I know you may find this frustrating, but I'm gonna have to answer your question with one of my own, as the onus for fixing this situation is on you. And you alone. So I ask you, Amy, how are you gonna make this right? How are you gonna make it right? Amy? Lost you there for a second, kiddo. Guess the solar flares are messing with your brain waves too, huh? Well, you've got all night to figure it out. You'll loop back. Good talk. Oh. Okay, can I see it? Well, I... I gotta be able to look at it if I'm to uh... Can I just see it? Okay, okay, okay, okay, I need to find something to clean that. Just uh... Okay, I need to find something to clean that. - Hey, hurry up. - Hold on, one second. Oh, fuck me. Uh, fuck me. Hydrogen peroxide. Topical solution. Sorry, sorry. I'm... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Jesus, just give it to me. Sienna, look, I'm really sorry. I don't know what the fuck came over her tonight. No, just she got one foot in the grave, that's what fucking came over her. What's that supposed to mean? She's washed up. She's finished and she fucking knows it. What's that saying about grief? The stages of grief. Um, anger. - Yeah, exactly. - Denial. It's fucking textbook. How's it going there, Amy? Change your mind about that walk-in? Ernie, it's locked. Mmhmm. Uh, well, open it. No can do, Amy. Ernie, why is the door locked? Standard protocol for a storm like this. Got to keep everybody safe. Ernie, I've got to get out of here. I'm afraid it's far too late for that, Amy. We're oscillating between a category 2 and category 3 hurricane here. That means FLP, full lockdown procedure. Say, you don't look so good. Let me ask you this, Amy. Have you been experiencing any sort of excessive salivation? I only ask because of your earlier difficulty swallowing that aspirin earlier and as I'm sure you already know or at least suspect, excessive salivation and difficulty swallowing are both symptoms of rabies. Ernie, I'm fine. Why don't you take a drink then? Wet your whistle. I don't want that shit. You don't have any sudden and inexplicable aversion to water now, do you, Amy? Because if you do, that's rabies. Ernie, are you gonna let me out of here or not? I've gotta get out of here, let me out of here, oh! Let's think this through, Amy. If you do have hydrophobia, you're not gonna wanna go out in this torrential rainstorm. Jesus fucking Christ! Hope you washed your wound with soap and water. You know, I always wondered why they put the obits next to the funny pages. You got any idea, Amy? Ernie, I don't know what the fuck is goin' on. Yeah. Me neither. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Amy. Real excited for you tonight, kiddo. Robert. How many times do I have to tell you, Amy, call me... Bob. Sorry. Sorry. Don't be sorry. A pretty girl like you shouldn't have the word "sorry" in her vocabulary. Take a breath. You still got five minutes. I just... I get into my own head sometimes. YOUNG Well, lucky for you. I've got the antidote. I don't think I should drink before a show. I hear the boss is cool with it. Your turn. Good, right? It's good. Amy Marlowe. Ten Minutes to Midnight. It's got a bit of a ring to it, huh? I've been chewing on it a while. It shows. You know, most other jocks would start right at the top of the hour. I don't think you ever told me why you wanted the extra 10? I don't know how much really changes day to day, but I know something does. And I kinda like the idea of being with people during that moment of transition. Hmm. You playin' this tonight? Plan to. You know, I've never heard this one. Robert, I don't know that I have much time for this. You know, I see something in you, Amy. This show could be something. You could be something. Man, last night was... Last night was a mistake. A tease. Am I right or am I right? I know. It's new. It's all new. All of this. But it wasn't a mistake. Let people say what they want. Let people think what they think. We're discreet, you and me. We're professionals. Yes? You are my new golden girl, Amy Marlowe. Which is why I got you this. Bob. Now, I myself don't subscribe to the whole angel/devil thing, and truth be told, I don't know where you stand either. But I saw you talking to yourself before your interviews. Figured you might be praying. And in the event anyone's listening. Dance with me. Oh. You still got two minutes, Amy. Dance with me. I have a show. We'll loop back. Good talk. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Golden girl. Get away from me! Get away from me! Whoa, whoa, Amy! - He's under there. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. He's under there, he was coming after me. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, look at me, look. - He's was gonna try to kill me. - Hey, hey. - He's was gonna try to kill me. - Hey, hey. It's just one of those nights, okay? Oh, Aaron. Oh, Aaron. You okay. Oh. - You're alright. - I saw something. There should have never been a night like this one. Oh fuck. Is this how you rolled back in the day? Punk rock Amy? Take no prisoners? Shut up, Aaron. Look, Ames, I... I know she's kind of a bitch. But that's just Sienna, she's always like that. - Wait, what? - I'm just sayin'. I wouldn't take it personally, 'cause in my experience, Sienna is a bitch. You know her? Well, she's been in a couple of times this week. Don't you bullshit me. Alright, what do you want me to say? I mean she was a skank, she swiped right on or something? Yo, Amy, it is not like that. We went to high school together, okay? - Oh fuck, Jesus fucking Christ. - What? It doesn't matter! Yes, it does matter. Did you recommend her? Oh, Amy, no. - Hey. - Why didn't you t... She talked to Bob. He asked me to show her around, that's my fucking job. I haven't seen her since high school. Why didn't you tell me? - Why didn't you... - Amy. - Warn me. - Listen. Look, I... I wanted to pretend like this wasn't changing. If you would've known what's goin' on, I wouldn't have been able to do that. I would've lost you. Bullshit excuse. Bullshit excuse. Bullshit excuse. I know that this is really hard for you. Aaron, you are a child. You have no way of understanding. Not what you said to me 15 years ago. You could've told me. Maybe. You should talk to her. Oh, fat fuckin' chance. Amy, that's what you do, alright? You talk to people. You're good at it. You see them even when they're invisible. And you should know something's... Something's goin' on with Sienna. - What? - Somethin's happening. I don't know. She won't show me her face. Her face? I bit her... I bit her on her wrist. I know. She still won't show me. I think you're the only person she'll talk to. Oh, Aaron, goddammit. Hey, hey. Where is she? Close the door. Aaron sent me to check on you. Why a bite? A slap or a shove or spitting on me even. But a bite? That's the most unexpected thing you've done in years. Finally something fresh. He said something was happening with you. Oh God. Sienna, you look fine. You really don't see it. It's dark in here. I can turn the light on. You tried that before. Remember? Look, I came here, because I wanted to... Apologize? Yeah, it's obvious. I can hear your heart ticking from here. Why don't you just let me do it? Ugh, it must be terrible. Knowing that you dug your own grave and now the maggots don't even want what's left of you. If it's so awful, what are you doing here? 18 months. Long enough so that my commitment isn't called into question and short enough so that I don't end up like you. Oh. Oh, you wanna bite me again, Amy Marlowe? What do you want? I... I... Yes? I want... Time? Do you see now, Amy? What's going on? What's going on? What's going on? - Oh. - Oh! - Oh. - Oh! You alright there, Amy? Aaron. Aaron. Where is Aaron? Yikes, Amy, those scratch... - Oh, just... - Marks look nasty. You know, my cousin Alistair got bit by a rabbit when we were in scouts and after that he never could stop scratching. That was definitely... Can you just tell me where Aaron is? Alright, you're clearly itchy - and agitated. - Yes. But are you also feeling any one or a combination of fever, headache, weakness... - Oh my God. - Mild or moderate paralysis, - confusion... - Mm... m... Insomnia, delirium, hallucinations... Abnormal behavior or generalized discomfort? Because if you are... Just tell me where the fuck he is! Bob's office, last time I checked. Thank you. You sure you're not seein' anything, Amy? Anything that's not really there? Want a bite? Ah! How's it going, kiddo? What the fuck? Rusty pipe. Where's Aaron? Ernie said he was in here. Have you and Sienna kissed and made up yet? What? I'm looking for him. Where is he? She's real upset about this whole thing. I don't give a shit. I've gotta find him. You can't make friends if you don't make amends. You know what? Yes, I have seen Sienna. She's in the tech room turning into a fucking monster. Uh... uh, don't call names, Amy. What? You women should be building each other up, not tearing each other down. - Are you fucking kidding me? - Whoa, Amy! There is a literal fucking monster out there. Airways are back up. Oh, excellent, Aaron. Uh, thank you. Oh, thank God. Thank God, thank God, I've been looking everywhere for you. Second. We're running ads now. - Show's back up in four. - Perfect. That's four minutes, everyone. Four minutes to the final curtain. What's goin' on? Aaron, I don't trust anyone. Okay, wait a sec. Rewind for me. I told you it doesn't make sense. Maybe, you should go to the walk-in, Amy. These symptoms sound pretty textbook. Sienna say that? Amy, you got bit by a wild animal tonight. Who knows what kind of diseases those things are carrying? Nothing that is happening to me is textbook. Well, maybe you should go lay down for a little bit. I couldn't sleep if I... Asleep. I must be asleep. I must be dreaming. That's it. This isn't real. That's it. That's it. That's it. It's... it's... it's... it's a dream or I'm sleeping or I passed out or something on the way in. It's... but... but... but you've gotta wake me up. You gotta wake me up, you gotta shake me, - you gotta scare me! - Okay, Amy, just fucking relax! Okay, so let's say that this is a dream. If that's the case, I'm not even really me, right? I'm part of you. Aaron, I've been here a long time and nobody sees me the way you do. Okay. Okay. Then just for the sake of argument, let's assume this is a nightmare. If that is actually the case, why would I be on your side? Yeah, I just don't think I'm following your logic here, Ames. Ow! Fuckin' hell! And if this was a dream, that wouldn't have hurt like that! Fuck. Fuck. Yeah, Amy, I don't think there's anything that I can do anything for you here that you can't do for yourself. Oh, but there is. Oh, but there is. You can hurt me. What? Remember, last month when we had that doctor on the air, he was talking about lucid dreaming. Remember that? Pain snaps you right out of it. Amy, I'm not gonna fucking hurt you. I'm not asking you. What the fuck! Amy, what the fuck! Stop it! Stop it! Are you fucking crazy? Stop it! Stop it! What the fuck! Amy. One minute till you're back on. No. No, no, no, no, no, no. - Yes, yes, yes! - No! Come on, kiddo. Let's give 'em a show to die for. Oh! There's Amy! Ready, boss? Yes, Ernie. Please, escort Ms. Marlowe to Studio A. No, no, Ernie, what are you doing? - Amy. - Stay the fuck away from me! You must fulfill your final contractual obligations. Stay the fuck aw... - You know this. - Let me go! Aaron, go check the levels. Let me go, god dammit! Let's go, up and out. Fuck you! - Amy... - Aaron... You're very loud. Aaron, don't go, don't go, don't go. Help me out, please. - Sorry, Amy. - Please. I still have a future here. No! Fucking let go of me! Why the sudden stage fright, Amy? Oh, you fucking bastard! Got a little fire in you! I'll miss that. 45 seconds, Amy. Aaron? Aaron? You gotta help me, man. You're losing it, Amy. Everyone's saying so. What? No, no! You are... no, no. 30 seconds. You and me, we sh... You care about me, I care about you. - Don't do this. - 15 seconds. If I were 30 years younger, me and you, maybe we would've... But you're not. You're old. You motherfucker. Who the hell do you think you are? Go back to your cum dumpster! See if I care! 10 seconds. I bled for this place for 30 goddamn years, but they still want another fuckin' night. 5, 4... I've been at the center of this so-called joke too long. You fucking sons of... It's Ten Minutes to Midnight. I'm Amy Marlowe. I think I'm going to die tonight. But I don't know how many of you are listening. I don't know if anybody is listening, but I think I'm gonna die. It's a strange thing, your last day. In anything, really. School, work, life. Everything's the same, till it's not. Routine becomes ritual, becomes obsession, till you're nothing more than a broken record. That's good shit. It's pretty fucked up, right? Caller on 2. Hello, caller? Caller? Sounding a little morbid, Amy. Sienna. Is this really how you wanna go out? Does anybody know the answer to that question? I'd guess most people think about it more than they admit. Is that so? Why don't you just accept it, Amy? And walk silently into the sunrise? No. Rage into the night. What do you see when you look in the mirror? I don't see anything. Not anymore. Fuck. Amy. Amy. I don't understand. I don't fear change, Amy. I adapt. Just a few hours now. He's yours. Yes. Yes. You want it now, don't you? Yes. You gave this to me, Amy. Let me give this to you. You know... ...I see something in you, Amy. This show could be something. You could be something. You still got two minutes, Amy. I'll try to make sure nobody knows it went down this way. We're discreet, you and me. We're professionals. Okay, come in. So what happens now? You never felt anything? What? For me. - Amy. - Anything for me. I mean of course, I did. You know, it was just... this was all hard enough you know, with... with you having to leave. But now... You know, we could be together. Given the circumstances. Together? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I mean I gotta say this... this is... You look really hot. I mean honestly, you looked like 20 years younger before. I was just trying to be nice, but now I... I can't resist you. Nice? Yeah, you know what I meant. Nice would've been telling me that my head was on the chopping block. I was in my head before. Okay? I told you... I was... I was just... I was in my head, but now, it's all you. I pro... It's all you, Amy, I promise. Look, you said that we were gonna figure this out together. So come on, let's figure this out together! I already have, Aaron. I gotta tell you... ...feels like I'm getting away with something. It's 10 Minutes to Midnight. I'm Amy Marlowe. Hi. Uh, Amy, can you... can you hear me? Yes, caller, I can hear you. Oh, great. Well um, yeah, I... I just started this new job a few months ago and it's... It's tough. I don't really do this for a thing, ask for advice. I do talk to myself a lot, though, that helps. But uh, my friend... uh, my friend said I should call, talk to someone who's maybe been there before. Do you dislike what you're doing? Oh, no. No, it's not that. I... I love the work. It's just... ...the environment can be challenging. I've always been really sure of myself. That's what all my teachers said in school, but right now, I'm honestly feeling kind of lost. Uh, I'm... I'm doing things that I never thought I'd do. Well, we all have to start somewhere. That's what I keep telling myself. Nobody falls right into where they want to be, it takes time, sacrifice. But I still can't help feeling like I'm letting someone down. Your mom? - Dad? - Oh, no. I've always pretty much been on my own. Who then? I don't know. Somebody. Out there. I was just hoping maybe you could give me some advice or I don't know um, point me in the right direction. You seem like somebody who knows who she is. I guess you could say that. But what about what you want? I have some ideas. Goals. Mostly it's feelings, though. What does that mean? You know what's funny, Amy? I listen to you every night and I still don't even know what you look like. I don't even have a picture of you in my mind, but still there's this intimacy. The cadence of your voice, the vibrations. Like I know you from the inside out. And so there's just this strong, warm sense within me that you're beautiful. Someone seeing me like that. I think that's what I want. It sounds like you're on your way. Amy's Advice? Please. Trust that warm feeling. Hold on to it. Let it lead you. Thanks, Amy. Maybe if I'm lucky, one day I'll end up like you. Good luck, caller. Oh, and congratulations on retirement. I know some people can be sad on days like this, but you did it! The hard part's over. Enjoy the victory lap. Goddamn, Jesus Christ! Come on, close the door. Get on in here. Oh, what all did you do this time? Aaron? Oh, he's already in the sound booth. By the way, Bob wants to see you in his office before the show. No. - No, no, no, no, no, no. - That looks pretty nasty. Was it that raccoon again? That little dumpster bitch. Sure hope he doesn't have rabies. What is going on? - What is going on? - Hey, hey, hey, relax, Amy. The storm's got everyone feelin' a little crazy. It's just one of those nights, yeah? He did not. You have got to be kidding me. Hand to God, sweetheart. Hand to God. Amy, come in. Cutting it kind of close, don't you think? Uh, Earth to Amy? Have you looked out a window? I can't say that I have. Got too good of a view right here. Oh Robert, stop it. Please, sweetheart. - Call me "Bob". - Bob. Sienna. Hmm, do you two know each other? Oh, no, I would've remembered. I grew up listening to you. Big fan. Then how do you know... Aaron uh, told me. I mean Ernie. Ernie. Are you alright, Amy? Never better. Alright, great. Well, she's gonna be your shadow tonight, so make sure you show her the ropes. Now, I don't want to impose. Nonsense. - She'd love to. - I'd love to. Good on you, kiddo. You remember how it is. It's nice to have someone there when you're transitioning. You know, that's what I like about you, Amy. You do it old school. Storm's really picking up, huh? You want a bite? Garlic noodle. What's up with you tonight? Storm got you feeling a little tweaked? Something like that. Oh, actually, you know what? It's probably solar flares. Bob said they've been causing dead air for most of the day. I heard that. Yeah, but don't worry, we should be good for the big show tonight. So sorry. Where do you want me? Sienna, can you get Robert for me? What? Robert. I need him. Now. Uh, yeah. Sure. Everything alright there, Ames? When did you know this was gonna be my last show? Uh, just... Give it to me straight. A week ago. Thanks. Kiddo, what's going on? I'm not gonna beat around the bush. This is it. Last show. I'm being replaced. Amy, let's not make a fuss. We have a nice sunrise farewell party for you planned. Red velvet cake. Yes, your favorite. My favorite. Five seconds, Amy. It's 10 Minutes to Midnight. I'm Amy Marlowe. Amy, my God, you really stuck the landing tonight, huh. I knew you had it in you. And this... this is all for you. Why do you look so depressed? You earned this. Enjoy. Having fun? You did great tonight. What's wrong? I don't know who I am without this place. Uh, Amy. Robert. Aaron, I just... You're leaving a legacy behind. Oh bullshit. The only thing you ever leave behind is a headstone and you're lucky if you get that. Well, I can't say I'm not gonna miss you. Too little, too late, I know, but I always kinda had a crush on you. You ever feel like you know someone? I mean really know them. Even if you've never seen them before? Of course, you do. Who am I talking to here? Ever realize the opposite is true? What do you mean? That people aren't who you think they are. That you never really knew anybody. Hmm. Hey! Alright, everybody! It's time for cake! Oh yeah! Yeah, it's time to cut, come on... We'll keep rolling into forever as we raise a glass to the vintage vixen of radio land. Let's make some noise and keep the party rolling for the lady of the hour and her last trip down the airwaves. It's Amy Marlowe, everybody. Come on and show her the love while you still can. Oh, there she is. Amy, my dear, Amy. My golden girl. 30 years you've been with me! 30 glorious years. And I do declare, without a shadow of a doubt, you have given us everything you have to give and tonight was no exception. I mean, what a finale! - Am I right? - Yeah. Am I right? - That's right? - Yeah. Oh, oh, I remember the very first day I met you, my dear Amy Marlowe. She was a shy young thing. But we gave you a voice, and a platform, and the rest is, as the scholars say, history. And I have made a career, as you know, nay... SIENNA, ROBERT, AND CROWD: A life! Right! Out of seeing things in people. And rest assured, your memory will surely live on. Your spirit is entombed in this building for as long as these walls shall stand. To Amy. To Amy! Yes. Of course, what kind of party would be this be without presents? Yeah, come on. Come on bring her up, bring her up. Come on, man. Oh, Amy, there she is. Ernie, take it away. Well, mine is a little bit more of a memento than a gift. I didn't wind it. Thought you'd like to spend as much time in 10 minutes to midnight as you could. Aaron. Oh, he's got somethin' for you, too. But first, Sienna. Got a little sneaky and found out the year you were born. Never would have guessed with how beautiful you are. This was bottled that same summer. May it fill your veins with the weight of history. To close the circle, Amy, you're as beautiful as the day you started here. And finally on behalf of everyone here, both past and present, now and forever. Well, perhaps now, you'll finally be able to get some of that much needed rest, Amy. Aaron. Hmm. These people, who are they? You don't know them? I don't know. I... I... I think so, I... but I... maybe. I don't know. You're not alone, Amy. It happens to everyone. It's time to say goodbye. Goodbye? God! It feels like forever when you're in the middle. By the time you get there, it's like... You know? I don't. Not yet at least. But I will. The end's always coming, Amy. Can't outrun it, 'cause we're always moving toward it. Just like that. I'm scared. I don't know what to do. Give into it, Amy. The sun is rising.
