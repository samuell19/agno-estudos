OH, SO IT WAS A BIG SECRET THEN. YEAH. ELDEN ? DO YOU WANT TO KISS ME ? [ Keys Jingling ] [ Puts Keys In Ignition, Starts Engine ] HERE. YOU DRIVE. SLIDE OVER. WHERE ? WHEREVER YOU WANT TO GO. PUT YOUR ARM AROUND ME. THERE. THAT'S BETTER. [ Whispers ] I'M GONNA GET SOMETHING TO DRINK. [ Door Closes ] I'M THIRSTY. WHAT ABOUT YOU ? YEAH. WAIT. WHAT'S THAT ? VODKA. [ Taps Elden's Glass ] YOU WERE THIRSTY, WEREN'T YOU ? TAKE YOUR CLOTHES OFF AND GET UNDER THE COVERS. [ Sighs ] I SET THE ALARM IN CASE WE FALL ASLEEP. [ Gasps ] ELDEN ? ELDEN ? [ Clock Ticking ] HI. [ Ticking Continues ] I CONKED OUT, DIDN'T I ? WHAT DO YOU MEAN ? I PASSED OUT, DIDN'T I ? I THOUGHT YOU WERE SLEEPING. YOU CAME INSIDE OF ME. YOU... REMEMBER ? I THINK SO. OH, ELDEN... TELL ME YOU LOVE ME. I LOVE YOU. KISS ME. I'LL DROP YOU OFF HERE AND NOBODY WILL KNOW. BYE. [ Engine Starts ] WOW. [ Chuckling ] I ONLY WISH MY FIRST LAY WAS THAT GREAT. [ Sighs ] HEY, THAT CONFIRMS IT. I MEAN, SHE'S INNOCENT. THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT, RIGHT ? UNLESS SHE COULD HAVE DONE THAT IN HALF AN HOUR. COULD SHE ? COULD SHE HAVE DONE ALL THAT ? NO. NO WAY. DRIVING BACK AND FORTH ALONE WOULD HAVE TAKEN HER THAT LONG. THEN WHAT'S BOTHERING YOU ? I'VE ALWAYS HAD IN THE BACK OF MY MIND-- WHAT ? JUST BEFORE I CAME TO, I FELT LIKE MAYBE SOMEBODY CAME IN THE ROOM, SLIPPED IN BED NEXT TO ME. JESUS, TOLBERT, WHICH IS IT ? DID IT HAPPEN OR NOT ? THAT'S THE THING. I REALLY DON'T KNOW. [ Reporters Clamoring ] [ Clamoring Continues ] [ Reporters Chattering, Shutters Clicking ] BACK UP, BACK UP. JESUS, SHE'S GORGEOUS. I TOLD YOU. [ Reporters Continue Clamoring ] [ Reporter #1 ] JUST A MOMENT OF YOUR TIME, MRS. SANDERSON. [ Reporter #2 ] WHY HAS YOUR ATTORNEY NOW DECIDED-- HEY. HEY. WHERE YOU GOING ? TO SEE RICK CHAMBERS. WHEN ARE THEY CALLING YOU ? [ Sighs ] THIS AFTERNOON. I'D LIKE TO SEE THAT GUY MYSELF. I KNOW, BUT-- STAY WITH IT. YOU'RE THE REPORTER NOW. [ Footsteps Departing ] HEY, WHAT'S HAPPENING ? [ Door Closes ] [ Elden ] I'VE BEEN CALLED TO TESTIFY. YOU ? YEAH. ABOUT WHAT ? ABOUT THAT NIGHT. BUT YOU DIDN'T HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH HER THAT NIGHT, DID YOU ? [ Swallows Hard ] I WAS WITH HER THAT NIGHT. I WAS WITH HER FROM 8:00 IN THE EVENING TILL 6:00 IN THE MORNING. I KNOW THAT'S HARD FOR YOU TO BELIEVE, BUT I'M TELLING YOU THE TRUTH. I WAS WITH HER ALL THAT TIME, EXCEPT FOR MAYBE BETWEEN 2:30 AND 3:00. WH-WHAT HAPPENED BETWEEN 2:30 AND 3:00 ? - I BLACKED OUT. - [ Laughing ] NO, NO, DON'T GET MAD. I DIDN'T MEAN TO LAUGH AT YOU. I'M LAUGHING AT MYSELF. I MEAN, GOD-- WELL, I'M DONE IN. I MEAN, THAT'S IT. SHE WON. SHE HAD A PERFECT OUT IN YOU. I'M JUST TELLING YOU THE TRUTH. I'LL DO THE SAME ON THE WITNESS STAND. HEY, HEY, I BELIEVE YOU. I BELIEVE YOU. OH, I'M SURE THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED. AH, JESUS, I CAN SEE IT NOW. GOD, THAT LITTLE BRAIN OF HERS THINKING, SPINNING... ON THOSE HOT, SWEATY, STIFLING SUMMER NIGHTS. OH, MAN. OH, SHE'S JUST WAITING AND WAITING... IN THAT FUCKING UNBEARABLE PLACE. AND THEN, HEY, HERE WE COME, YOU AND ME, AND SHE'S GONNA BE FREE. AND THAT'S IT, THAT'S WHAT SHE WANTED: TO BE FREE. [ Chuckles ] YEAH. [ Clicks Tongue, Sighs ] SO DID YOU FUCK HER ? HUH ? YOU KNOW, COME ON. DID YOU MAKE LOVE ? GOOD. NOW, YOU KNOW, HUH ? YEAH, YOU KNOW WHY I DID WHAT I DID. IT GETS LONELY SOMETIMES WHEN NOBODY UNDERSTANDS WHAT YOU WENT THROUGH. I MEAN, SOMETIMES, HUH... SHE DOESN'T EVEN MOVE. SHE JUST LAYS THERE, AND I CAN SEE HER FACE SLOWLY TURNING PINK. AND HER EAR LOBES ARE BLUSHING. AND I CAN SEE IN HER FACE THAT SHE'S FEELING MY PRICK INSIDE HER... EXPLODING ! [ Laughing ] OH, MAN. FUCK GOD ! YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN ? FUCK HIM, MAN. GOD'S NOTHING BUT A PRICKLESS SHIT ! [ Laughs ] YOU KNOW WHY I CAME HERE ? YOU WANT TO KNOW IF... THE THING REALLY HAPPENED. YEAH. IT HAPPENED JUST THE WAY I SAID IT HAPPENED. I CAN'T TELL YOU EXACTLY WHAT TIME TO WHAT TIME, BUT I CAN TELL YOU... IT WAS 3:00 IN THE MORNING WHEN THE AMBULANCE FINALLY CAME. HEY, KID, DON'T MAKE SUCH A LONG FACE. YOU CALL THEM AS YOU SEE THEM, RIGHT ? THAT'S THE SYSTEM, THE AMERICAN WAY. YEAH. AND IF SHE GETS AWAY WITH IT... HECK, THE MORE POWER TO HER. BECAUSE SHE DESERVES IT. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN ? SHE'S SO WONDERFUL. I MEAN, SHE DESERVES IT. SO THAT'S IT. AND THE BEST OF LUCK TO YOU. HEY, KID, COME BACK AND SEE ME SOMETIME, WILL YOU ? WE CAN COMPARE NOTES ON ALL THE NOOKS AND CRANNIES. JESUS. THIS GUY CHUCK MULLIGAN-- RIGHT, MARTHA'S BROTHER. YEAH. ONE SCARY BASTARD. WHAT DID HE DO ? THE GUY ACTUALLY DUG UP HER OLD CAR, AND HE FOUND THE SKI MASK. WHAT SKI MASK ? THE ONE THAT SUPPOSEDLY SCARED THE LIVING SHIT OUT OF CHAMBER'S WIFE. THE COURTROOM WAS BUG-EYED WHEN THAT THING WAS INTRODUCED. THE THING IS, THEY PUT YOUR ELSIE ON THE STAND, AND THEY DID NOT MAKE HER LOOK GOOD AT ALL. MAXWELL STRONG, THE LEAD PROSECUTOR, IS ONE AMBITIOUS SON OF A BITCH. HER LAWYER KEEPS PUTTING UP OBJECTIONS, BUT IT'S AFTER THE FACT. I THINK HE'S COUNTING ON YOU. WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENED ? YOU THINK SHE'S GUILTY OR NOT ? YOU OUGHT TO KNOW BY NOW. I DON'T. IT'S GONNA BE UP TO THE JURORS, WHAT THEY THINK. [ Sighs ] I FEEL SICK, HARRY. [ Exhales ] WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENED IN THOSE 30 MINUTES ? WAS IT 30 MINUTES ? I HAVE TO SAY WHAT I KNOW, AND I HAVE TO SAY WHAT I DON'T KNOW. [ Sighs ] JESUS, HARRY, I REALLY FEEL SICK. NOW THEN, WHAT HAPPENED NEXT ? WE TALKED IN THE CAR. [ Defense Attorney ] JUST TALKED ? - WE KISSED. - THEN WHAT HAPPENED ? WE, UH... WE TOOK A DRIVE. WE PULLED OFF AT A ROADSIDE JUST OUTSIDE OF TOWN. AND YOU TALKED THERE AS WELL ? [ Elden ] YES. -AND THEN ? -THEN WE WENT BACK TO HER HOUSE. - TO HER BEDROOM, I BELIEVE. - YES. AND DID YOU MAKE LOVE TO HER ? YES. [ Spectators Murmuring ] AT WHAT TIME DID YOU LEAVE MRS. SANDERSON'S HOUSE ? [ Sighs ] IT WAS 5:30 THE NEXT MORNING. SHE DROVE ME BACK. SO, IN SUMMING UP THE EVENTS OF AUGUST 30, 1989, YOU SPENT THE ENTIRE NIGHT WITH ELSIE SANDERSON... FROM 8:00 IN THE EVENING UNTIL 5:30 THE NEXT MORNING. - ESSENTIALLY, YES. - WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY "ESSENTIALLY" ? I BLACKED OUT. YOU MEAN, YOU FAINTED ? YES. WHAT WERE YOU DOING WHEN THIS OCCURRED ? WE WERE IN BED. [ Spectators Murmuring ] [ Defense Attorney ] HOW LONG DID THIS BLACKOUT LAST ? HALF AN HOUR. WHY ARE YOU SO SURE THAT IT WAS ONLY HALF AN HOUR ? BECAUSE WHEN WE GOT THERE, SHE SET THE ALARM CLOCK. I HAD TO LEAVE EARLY IN THE MORNING, AND SHE WAS AFRAID WE MIGHT OVERSLEEP. I SEE. WHAT TIME WAS IT WHEN SHE SET THE CLOCK ? DID YOU SEE THE TIME ? YES, SIR, 2:30 IN THE MORNING . WHEN YOU CAME OUT OF YOUR BLACKOUT, DID YOU SEE THE TIME ? YES, SIR, 3:00 A.M. SO, TO RECAP, YOU CAN ACCOUNT FOR ELSIE SANDERSON'S WHEREABOUTS... FROM 8:00 IN THE EVENING UNTIL 5:30 THE FOLLOWING MORNING, WITH THE POSSIBLE EXCEPTION OF BETWEEN 2:30 AND 3:00 A.M. - IS THAT CORRECT ? - YES, SIR, THAT'S CORRECT. - SHE FIXED THE CLOCK ! - [ Judge Pounding Gavel ] [ Judge ] ORDER ! DAMN IT, CAN'T YOU SEE IT ? SHE FIXED IT ! DON'T LET HER FOOL YOU. DON'T LET HER FOOL YOU ! SHE'S JUST USING YOU, MAN ! GET OFF ME ! I HAVE NO FURTHER QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME, YOUR HONOR. DEFENSE RESERVES THE RIGHT TO RECALL. THANK YOU, MR. TOLBERT. WELL... YOU HAVE JUST EXONERATED YOUR FRIEND, MRS. SANDERSON. YOU KNOW THAT ? - IF YOU SAY SO. - WHY IF I SAY SO ? - I THOUGHT THE JURY WERE THE ONES WHO DECIDE THAT. - TRUE ENOUGH. BUT YOU STILL HAVEN'T ANSWERED MY QUESTION... BECAUSE YOU WEREN'T SURE ABOUT THAT HALF AN HOUR, WERE YOU ? MATTER OF FACT, YOU'RE NOT SURE THAT 2:30 WAS THE RIGHT TIME. - I'M VERY SURE OF WHAT I SAW. - SHE SET THE ALARM IN FRONT OF YOU ? NO. NO ? - WHERE WAS THE CLOCK ? - SHE BROUGHT IT IN FROM THE BATHROOM. SO SHE COULD HAVE SET THE TIME IN THE BATHROOM. REAL TIME COULD'VE BEEN 1:00 OR 12:30. YOU SIMPLY DON'T KNOW. ABOUT THIS FAINTING SPELL-- HAD ANYTHING OF THE SORT EVER HAPPENED TO YOU... PRIOR TO YOUR AFFAIR WITH MRS. SANDERSON ? YES, IT HAD, AND IT WASN'T AN AFFAIR. JUST ANSWER THE QUESTIONS, PLEASE. WHEN DID IT HAPPEN ? A COUPLE OF WEEKS BEFORE WITH MY GIRLFRIEND. I HAD TOO MUCH TO DRINK. SO, IT'S RELATED TO SEXUAL ACTIVITY AND ALCOHOL ? - YES. - MY SYMPATHIES. NOW, DID MRS. SANDERSON KNOW ABOUT YOUR PROBLEM ? YES, WE DISCUSSED IT. SO SHE KNEW IN DETAIL THAT IT WAS ALCOHOL-INDUCED ? OBJECTION. THERE IS NO MEDICAL EVIDENCE THAT IT WAS ALCOHOL-INDUCED. - REPHRASE, COUNSELOR. - ALCOHOL-RELATED. YES. DID YOU HAVE ANY ALCOHOL THAT NIGHT, DURING DINNER PERHAPS ? YES. HOW MUCH ? - TWO BOTTLES OF WINE. - TWO BOTTLES OF WINE, YOU SAY ? YEAH, WELL, WE WERE THERE A LONG TIME. HOW ABOUT IN THE CAR ? NO. - IN THE BEDROOM ? - YES. HOW MUCH ? TWO GLASSES OF VODKA AND ORANGE JUICE AND-- - AND ? - AND A SWIG OF VODKA, I GUESS. BUT IF YOU KNEW YOU HAD THIS PROBLEM, WHY DID YOU HAVE SO MUCH TO DRINK ? BECAUSE I HAD A LOT AT THE RESTAURANT AND NOTHING HAPPENED WHEN WE WERE IN THE CAR. SO, I-I FIGURED... I'D OVERCOME THE THING SOMEHOW. BESIDES, I WAS VERY THIRSTY. THIRSTY FOR ORANGE JUICE MAYBE, BUT A SWIG OF VODKA ? COME ON. DID SHE DARE YOU ? SHOVE THE BOTTLE IN YOUR FACE AND DARE YOU TO BE A MAN ? NO, IT WASN'T LIKE THAT AT ALL ! YOU TELL ME HOW IT WAS, PRECISELY. SHE PASSED IT TO ME FROM HER MOUTH. [ Spectators Murmuring, Gavel Pounding ] WELL, THAT'S INCREDIBLE. I MEAN, SHE DIDN'T EVEN HAVE TO CHALLENGE YOU. SHE JUST SHOVED IT DOWN YOUR MOUTH BECAUSE SHE KNEW YOU WOULD HAVE A FAINTING SPELL ! - OBJECTION ! THIS IS TOTALLY SPECULATIVE ! - IT WASN'T LIKE THAT AT ALL. [ Judge Pounds Gavel ] ORDER. IF YOU HAVE NO FURTHER QUESTIONS, MR. STRONG, WE'LL TAKE A RECESS HERE. UH, IF I MAY, YOUR HONOR, I DO HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION, THEN I'M FINISHED. PROCEED THEN. - YOU'RE A JOURNALIST, AREN'T YOU ? - YES. AND YOU COVERED THIS TRIAL FROM ITS BEGINNING UNTIL TODAY ? YES. YOU ALREADY TESTIFIED THAT YOU REMEMBER THE DATE AUGUST 30... BECAUSE YOU WERE LEAVING TO GO TO YOUR COLLEGE THE NEXT DAY. YES. BUT THE DATE OF THIS ALLEGED INCIDENT... HAS BEEN MENTIONED SEVERAL TIMES THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF THIS TRIAL, WAS IT NOT ? YES. THEN WHY DIDN'T YOU COME FORWARD UNTIL TODAY... TO SAY THAT I WAS WITH THIS WOMAN... AND THAT SHE'S INNOCENT BECAUSE I WAS WITH HER THAT NIGHT ? - I DON'T KNOW. - YOU COULD'VE SAVED US A WHOLE LOT OF GRIEF. YOU COULD'VE SAVED US A WHOLE LOT OF MONEY. WHY DIDN'T YOU COME FORWARD EARLIER ? I DON'T KNOW ! WAS IT BECAUSE YOU WANTED TO KEEP YOUR MEMORIES... OF MRS. SANDERSON THE WAY YOU WANTED THEM ? OR WAS IT BECAUSE YOU COULDN'T STAND TO BELIEVE THAT YOUR MEMORIES... WERE, IN FACT, THE COVER-UP OF THIS HORRIBLE CRIME ? - I DON'T KNOW ! - YOU DON'T KNOW ? [ Scoffs ] YOU DON'T KNOW ? YOU CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING ELSE ? WHAT ELSE ARE YOU DOING TO PROTECT THIS WOMAN ? HOW MANY LIES WILL YOU TELL TO PROTECT HER ? DAMN IT ! I'VE BEEN TRYING TO TELL THE TRUTH, THE TRUTH ! [ Gavel Pounding ] YOU PULL A STUNT LIKE THAT AGAIN, I'LL KICK YOU OUT OF HERE. HEAR ME ? I APOLOGIZE, YOUR HONOR. THIS COURT IS RECESSED... TILL TOMORROW, 9:00 A.M. [ Pounds Gavel ] [ Sighs ] [ Reporters Clamoring, Shutters Clicking ] [ Clamoring, Clicking Continue ] [ Bodyguard ] LEAVE HER ALONE. BACK AWAY. BACK AWAY. [ Continue Clamoring ] [ Clamoring Continues ] [ Limo Departing ] BUT, IN LIGHT OF TODAY'S PROCEEDINGS, HOW CAN YOU BE SO CONFIDENT ? I'M CONFIDENT BECAUSE SHE'S INNOCENT... OF SUCH VILE AND INSIDIOUS INTENT. THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY. THANK YOU. [ Reporters Clamoring ] NO MORE QUESTIONS. I MADE A MESS, DIDN'T I ? HEY, MAN, YOU WERE JUST BEING HONEST, OBJECTIVE. [ Sighs ] WHAT DO YOU THINK THE VERDICT'S GONNA BE ? WELL, I KNOW ONE THING. WHEN YOU SAID SHE PUT THE VODKA RIGHT IN YOUR MOUTH, THAT HAD A BIG IMPACT ON THE JURORS. I WAS WATCHING THEIR FACES AND... THEY DID NOT LIKE THAT A BIT. [ Sighs ] DID ELSIE SANDERSON CALL YOU TO HAVE DINNER ? NO, I DID. I CALLED HER TO SAY GOOD-BYE. I SEE. AND SHE SUGGESTED THAT YOU TWO GO OUT FOR DINNER ? NO, I-- I, UM, REMINDED HER THAT WE HAD... TALKED ABOUT IT A WHILE BACK. "A WHILE BACK" ? I SEE. AND YOU SAY YOU REMINDED HER ? AND SHE AGREED TO GO OUT TO DINNER WITH YOU THAT EVENING ? YES. I SEE. I HAVE NO FURTHER QUESTIONS, YOUR HONOR. THANK YOU, MR. TOLBERT. YOU MAY STEP DOWN. [ Defense Attorney ] NOW, MR. TOLBERT'S TESTIMONY WAS FORTHCOMING, AND HE IS TO BE COMMENDED FOR HIS EFFORT TO BE TRUTHFUL, THOUGH DESCRIBING SOME OF THOSE EVENTS MUST HAVE BEEN PAINFUL REMINDERS OF HIS YOUTH. YET, THE PROSECUTION HAS TWISTED THIS YOUNG MAN'S HONESTY. THEY CONTEND THAT HIS TESTIMONY IS NOTHING MORE THAN... A DIABOLICAL PLOT DESIGNED TO ESTABLISH AN ALIBI FOR MRS. SANDERSON. THE PROSECUTION HAS SPECULATED THAT MRS. SANDERSON... HAD SET THE YOUNG TOLBERT UP, FED HIM VODKA TO INDUCE HIS BLACKOUT... AND MANIPULATED TIME. BUT YOU'VE ALSO HEARD FROM MR. TOLBERT... THAT ANY OF THESE SPECULATIONS WOULD NEVER HAVE TAKEN PLACE... IF HE HIMSELF HAD NOT CALLED MRS. SANDERSON THAT AFTERNOON. NO DINNER, NO EMBRACE, NO DRINKS, AND, THEREFORE, NO BLACKOUT. THE UNIMPEACHABLE PROOF OF HER INNOCENCE... LIES IN THESE VERY FACTS. SO, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE PROSECUTION MAY SPECULATE UNTIL HELL FREEZES OVER, BUT RIGHT NOW, IN THIS COURTROOM, THE FACTS REMAIN... THAT ON AUGUST 30 OF 1989, ELSIE SANDERSON WAS WITH YOUNG ELDEN TOLBERT... FROM 8:00 IN THE EVENING UNTIL 5:30 THE FOLLOWING MORNING. AND IF HE, MR. TOLBERT, HAD NOT TELEPHONED MRS. SANDERSON BEFOREHAND, THESE EVENTS WOULD NEVER HAVE TAKEN PLACE. I LEAVE THESE FACTS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, TO YOUR GOOD COMMON SENSE. THANK YOU. NOT GUILTY. GUESS THAT GUY WASN'T SO BAD AFTER ALL. GUESS NOT. WHERE YOU GOING FROM HERE ? TO SEE MY COUSIN, I GUESS. DROP ME OFF AT THE AIRPORT ON THE WAY ? [ Reporter Clamoring ] HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THE VERDICT ? I'M GRATIFIED. YES, OF COURSE. [ Reporter #2 ] WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS NOW, MR. SANDERSON ? [ Shutters Clicking ] [ Whispering ] WE'RE PLANNING TO GO DOWN TO ARGENTINA, MAYBE BUY SOME HORSES DOWN THERE. WE HAVE A LITTLE SPREAD IN ARIZONA. WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO SETTING UP A NICE HOME, MAYBE A FAMILY. I'M SORRY YOU HAD TO GO THROUGH ALL THAT. I'M GLAD EVERYTHING TURNED OUT OKAY. I'LL ALWAYS REMEMBER YOU, ELDEN. [ Reporters Clamoring ] [ Elden ] IF I HADN'T CALLED HER THAT AFTERNOON-- WELL, THAT'S WHAT THE DEFENSE SAYS. THE LAWYER RESTED HIS WHOLE CASE ON IT. BUT SHE COULD HAVE ALWAYS COUNTED ON ME TO CALL HER THAT DAY. SHE KNEW I WOULD NEVER HAVE GONE OFF WITHOUT SAYING GOOD-BYE. BUT LIKE RICK SAYS... IF SHE GETS AWAY WITH IT... MORE POWER TO HER. SHE'S SO WONDERFUL. WHOEVER'S TELLING THE TRUTH, THE FACT IS, WE BOTH SPENT THE NIGHT WITH THE SAME WOMAN AND CAME AWAY WITH DIFFERENT RECOLLECTIONS. ONE THING'S FOR SURE: WHEN IT COMES TO LOVE, NO TWO MEMORIES ARE THE SAME. CLOSED-CAPTIONED BY CAPTIONS, INC. LOS ANGELES
