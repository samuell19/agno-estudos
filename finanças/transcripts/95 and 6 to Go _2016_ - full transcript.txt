A young girl looks up into the sky and twirls. A chainsaw stops. There is a silence. A distant voice calls, 'Mika.' "A small red glove floats to the surface of the water." How would you describe the story, okay? If you were telling someone what this story was about, okay, the script, how would you describe it? [small bird calls by the window] The daughter died, huh?

Both of them are bitter with love. But they don't want to... fall in love. [TV plays in the next room] So you gotta make the plot, you gotta give the plot more... fat. Something to reason... how they gonna fall in love. [wind rushes] So what you're gonna have is change the title, and... something that come together, "Adhesion."

[steps on the soft grass, birds calling] [temple gong rings out in the distance] [dulcet music] So how did you first meet Grandma? Huh? How did you first meet Grandma? Oh, went horseback riding at Kahaluu. That's how I met her. What did you think of her when you first saw her? Well, I never did have a girlfriend before, never even attempt to have a girlfriend. Our first concern was to survive, making money. So did you fall in love with her right away? Huh? - You fell in love with her? - What? Did you fall in love with her right away? No. I didn't. So why did you ask her to marry you? Well, because her father met me that day. He said, "Oh, you're Takesue's son." He says, "Oh." Her father and my father were classmates in Japan. So he knew my father well, and he told me, "Oh, why don't you marry my daughter?" Yeah, he told me that the go-betweens, the relatives said, "Oh, you better get married because... with your father being single all these years, and your folks are struggling to get along. So you need a wife to take care the house." This side don't have. Oh, there's a lot down there. You feel some? Just a couple more. So you didn't really fall in love. It was just a good matchmaking? Yeah. [Julie Andrews sings on TV] ♪ To sing through the night ♪ like a lark who is learning to pray ♪ I go to the hills when my heart is lonely... ♪ So you think you made a good choice in marrying Grandma? - Well, she was a good wife. She was a good housekeeper. But she didn't have the same enjoyment. She didn't care for movies. She didn't care for watching TV, so. We're on the bus. We're traveling and seeing the scene, a beautiful scene. She goes and sleep, sleeping. So I have to wake her. I said, "Oh! Look at the beautiful..." I don't know. So I used to date her... and we go to the movies, Waikiki Theatre. Halfway in the theater, I look at her, she's sleeping. She's not interested in the movie. - What was she interested in? - Huh? What was she interested in? Nothing. Don't you ever show this public and gonna get me in problem... trouble. I don't know why you keep on taking me, taking me, getting me into trouble. I'm not gonna get you into any trouble. I want a family history. [man singing in Japanese] When do you think Grandma was most happy in her life? I guess when... Elsa was alive. Where is our Takesue family from? Yamaguchi. Yamaguchi, Japan. So do you think the family came here because they were poor? Farmers was always poor. Grandpa had to leave the family to come Hawai'i to work, to send home money. They weren't paying anybody good over here. They were just like slaves. Then somehow he sent for a wife, and Grandma came down. They got married, but Grandma got... spilled some gasoline on her kimono and got burned, and she died. Her clothes caught on fire, her kimono, and they couldn't take it off, huh? And I was only two and a half years old, so he couldn't take care of my sister and both of us. So he had to quit the laundry, and then he came back to the country club as a assistant cook. And then he couldn't take care of my sister and me. So my sister was farmed out to his cousin's mother. So I was left with the bachelor man, and he took care of me while my father was working till 9:00 in the night. When I was at country club, I had about... only about three boys to play with. Dinnertime, the parents would call them home for dinner and take a bath. And I'm the only one nobody calls. And I felt so lonely. [TV plays, can opener whirs] In 1929, Wall Street crashed. Everybody was out of a job. So my father, them all didn't have jobs. He couldn't pay the mortgage. So our house was under foreclosure. Third year I was in high school, I was taking all my Algebra, Science to go into the university was required, see? In my junior year, I found out I could never afford the tuition of $200 per semester. That's $400. So I stopped taking my required subjects, and I finished high school. Depression was still on. 1934, applied for office boy. No way. Couldn't even find a service station job. Then in November, I saw there was gonna be a test at the Post Office. So I went there, and I took my test in 1935. The physical those days was you gotta carry 100 pounds. And then you gotta be 125 pounds in weight. And you gotta be 5 feet 4. So I didn't have, I was only about 124, 123, just about under 125. Oh, so the day that we're gonna have a test, I took a lot of shoyu and milk, I mean water. Shoyu, so I get thirsty. I drink a lot of water. So I went there, just passed it by 125. So then, I got in. [gentle bird calls in the distance] You know during the war, what was it like for the Japanese here? Oh, we were suppressed. No respect for us. Other people, other races... they think we're the cause of it, that we don't have any... We weren't the cause of it. It's Japan. But still, they discriminated. Even today, don't think they all accept you. You know, with Japanese culture, what do you think is most important about it? Obligation. The people that supported you, people that were nice to you, you just gonna forget them? You'd be just like a animal. [music plays on TV] [song from TV continues playing] [fireworks crackle, then burst] Turn the light, and you better run away. Okay, go!

[TV plays as fireworks continue] ['50s style music with a Latin beat] "The sexy teasing sounds of the '50s music drifted in." Koji and Mariane dance together. At first, they move cautiously across the dance floor, but their dance become intimate and seductive. "They kiss, hoping they will become lovers." You were a good dancer, right? Not bad. I remember. You were good. I used to enjoy it because I took my lessons seriously; I enjoyed it. What was your favorite dance? I liked the Waltz... and Latin, Rhumba. What about the Cha Cha? Oh yeah, I loved that. I knew the Rhumba, Tango, Cha Cha, Samba. You know, like "Dancing With the Stars," you seen that program? You don't do that on a ballroom floor. That's only a exhibition dance, you know? You've got no room to do that. If everybody did that, you'd be banging and banging and banging everybody. Went to New York on a convention, all of us boys. We didn't bring our wives because they don't pay for our wives. So we went to New York, and we try to see the Rockettes, musical, Broadway show. And then went to this nightclub, famous nightclub. I forgot. So I went in there. They start playing music, and all of us boys, nobody to dance with. Oh, the beautiful music, nightclub, and only a few people on the dance floor. So I wished Grandma was here. Yeah, that was the only time I says, "Oh, I wish I could dance on this floor." So you wished Grandma was there? Yeah. [Hiccups] Or anybody who could dance that way, you know? After Elsa died, then Grandma didn't wanna go dancing, huh. Yeah. So we stopped dancing. [jazz music with trumpet in the lead] That's the Foxtrot. How did you first meet Grandma? My cousin was the... - Oh, we went horseback riding. So went up the mountain trail and came down. That's how I met her. And he just followed wherever my horse went, you know. And I used to think, "Oooh, this guy," you know? Just followed me. Yeah, wherever the horse went, he came up right almost directly back of my horse. So Grandpa was what your first impression of Grandma? - Nooo! - [Laughs] - No, really. - He used to call me. Right after he met me, every single night he used to call me. And then it got to a point that ooh, I used to think, "Oh, what a guy." He just irritated me. And then he insisted for months and months trying to take me out. So I called my brother. My brother and him, they were classmates, huh? We went to school at Central Junior High School, - so I knew the brother. - Central Junior, out in town. So I told my brother, I said, "You know this guy Tom Takesue?" I say, "He calls me every night," I said. "What a nuisance, you know?" I said, "What kind of guy was he while you folks were classmates and all that?" He said, "He was a real nice guy, but within those years" he may have changed. I don't know. But as far as I know," he says, "he was a real nice guy." And that's, when he say, and, "He keeps on calling and calling, calling." So when he called you, what did he talk about? The first thing was, you took me to... Oh, I asked for a date. But he was rather shy, though, you know? And then another thing he asked me, because I hardly talked to him, and I don't know, I wasn't interested in him at all. And so he says, you asked me, "Do you love me?" [laughs] - You said... You did! - Naahhhh! - Tom! And you said, "If I marry a woman, I want to make sure that who loves me." Don't you know, driving me back down the Paali. So then I told my brother again. I said, "That guy, I don't know." They all used to say that boys from Honolulu were bums, you know. We used to hear that. [waves crashing] What did you think of the screenplay? Very good. I didn't know you can write that well. [Laughs] Not that time. [Chuckles] It's terrific, huh, after all. [Laughing] After all. I didn't know you were interested! I'm so happy! Why I'm not? I didn't know you were interested in it. I'm so flattered. No. Yeah, so I was reading that this morning. The more I read it, continued reading, it was so interesting. So I said, "Oh, how interesting. I didn't know Kimi wrote all this thing." And you used the right Japanese words in the right place and all that. So I said "Oh boy, Kimi's okay." Yeah. [laughing] I was proud of you after reading that. But Grandpa, you know, you let Grandpa read, too. [newscast on cigarette tax plays on TV] "The Way You Look Tonight." - Uhuh. Will be a good song to be at the ending. You think so? Yeah, cause Koji gonna say: [Singing] ♪ Someday, when I'm awfully low. He's gonna sing to maybe karaoke the last time to her. [sings] ♪ When I'm awfully low, ♪ I will feel a glow ♪ just thinking of you ♪ and the way you look tonight ♪ Never, never, never change Keep this worth, no, ♪ something smile for a da da da da da ♪ and the way you look tonight ♪ And the chorus. I forget all the words to that, but it's a good song to tell that... "Stay, the way you look tonight." - You know? You know? - That's a good idea. I think you need me for [laughs] Associate Director. You see, the fluid goes up to the brains. Then it makes her kind of off the beam. Yeah, yeah. So they're gonna find out... and also whether she had a stroke or not. And also, the next day she's going to a liver. They're gonna take a liver scan. Yeah, so next week she has two to go. [chorus of birds] You're gonna have to stay nice and healthy so that you get to see the movie, okay? Because it's gonna take me a little while to make it. And I want you to be there in the theater to watch it, okay? Thinking about you and say, "Oh, that's" "my granddaughter," you know? And I want you to come to the screening. And then I'll say, "Oh, and I'd like to thank my grandparents" who read the script in the early stages and gave me some feedback. "And I'd like them to stand up and to thank them." Okay? Okay! So you have to stay nice and healthy so that you can come to the screening, okay? Yeah, but you're not certain about when though, huh? Well, it's gonna take me a little while. So it takes, you know, a couple years. You gotta hang in there. Oh, I hope I live that long, though. Okay? So that will give you some incentive, okay, Grandma? Okay, I'll live for that. [voices harmonizing, singing quietly] [bell rings, rain falls softly] [thunder rolls] [Buddhist chanting] [chanting continues as wheel loader roars and clanks] [chanting continues, fades out softly to reveal birdsong] [wind lightly rustles trees] [TV plays] See look, look. "Memories Are Far." They're gonna have the show on the 5th, a short story, yeah? Yeah, I gotta get a companion or a caregiver. I'm not gonna end up like my father, all alone. Well, what kind of companion would you want? A woman who can take care of me, cook for me, keep me company, likes the same thing. If I get married, then maybe kind of problem, huh? If I die they're gonna have a big problem for my estate, huh? Just like my friend, Chunky. He married a Japan girl from on the golf course, playing golf course. Two years time, she took everything away from him. I'm gonna try to be away most of the time, traveling. Traveling all over. Would you want me to come along with you? I'm going with a companion. I told you. So you wouldn't wanna go with me? No, I wanna go with a companion. You better start working. Don't think about you gonna... You better start working. Get a steady job. Can't be just loafing around. So where do you think you're gonna meet this person? What? Where do you think you'll meet this person? I have to clean up this place. I have no time to go out and meet people yet. I got to settle a lot of this paperwork and get settled and then... go out meeting people. There's a lot of these tours. They're single people traveling, and most of them are women. But I cannot pick up any women. I have to see what kind of woman it is. I don't want to be taken. So when everything is done, I'm gonna have a good time. Spend all my money. I gave my children all the education they want. I gave my granddaughters, helped my granddaughters. So it's my time to... Yep, so after I clean this place up, I have to figure out what I'm gonna do. [bottles clanging] [papers rustling] [thunder] Oh, this is from San Francisco Public Library. [ripping paper] How did Grandma get that? I think it was for Elsa, I think. [pensive music] Oh, Elsa! Grandpa? How old was Elsa when she died? 33. And how did she die? Accident. Grandpa, do you think because Auntie Elsa died, right? - What? - Your daughter died. Yeah. So do you feel you could relate? Huh? Could you relate to the story, since Koji's daughter died? No. It doesn't relate. I know, but when you were reading it, did you feel like you could understand some of his pain after his daughter died? Well, I try to forget it. I couldn't help it. What can I do after she died? You grieve for a while, but then after, you have to forget. You have to keep on going on with your life. You cannot be grieving all your life because of that. [plastic bags rustling, garbage truck passes down the street] Oh, the garbage man came already. [garbage truck beeps, driving in reverse] [clock ticking] [slow music] Have you been missing Grandma? Of course. We could have gone more places and did more things, but she didn't want to do a lot of things. Yeah. I guess maybe internally she wasn't feeling good, huh? With her liver problem. So the title is... "Melting Bitterness" or something like that. And the song, you can play: "Autumn Leaves." "Autumn Leaves." You know the song? Nat King Cole sings that. Beautiful song. [instrumental version of "Autumn Leaves" with sax in the lead] But then, I don't know about whatever permission you gotta get from the songwriter. It's expensive. - Grandpa? - Huh? - Those songs are expensive. - What? - Expensive. - Expensive? Why, you cannot use the songs? They're expensive. If you use the song without their knowledge, what? You get sued. Well, you can make a compromise. The revenue, get certain percent of the revenue. Because you don't know whether it's gonna be successful or not, the picture. - You wanna be my manager? - Huh? You wanna be my manager? So Grandpa do you have any more advice for me on my screenplay? But how is it gonna end? Huh? You didn't like the ending? Wanted to see a happy ending. I told you about Koji has to go back to Japan because the wife was sick. Well, that's not in the script, though. That's not in the script. So what, you have your own ending for the film? Yeah, so you gotta change the script little bit. So while Koji's back in Japan taking care the wife who's sick, and Mariane is taking care of the old lady. After a couple of years, one, two years... Mariane, the lady dies. So the guy gonna give her $50,000 going away gift, severance pay. So she figure with the $50,000, she's gonna open a trailer, you know, like a Bento truck. And when she has just started, Koji came back from Japan because the wife died. [Coughs] And he went back to his friend's place where they make Bento. And the friend say, "Oh, she just started a Bento shop. She just opened up." So Koji going over there and help her. Things went pretty good, you know. They start selling musubi and all that, Spam musubi. And maybe Spam company can give you a grant for putting "Spam musubi" on the trailer. [Laughs] So they're gonna get married right in the park where their lunch wagon is. The reverend pronounce them man and wife. So he says, "Well, Koji, you kiss your bride," you know. [chuckling] But he doesn't know how. So Mariane grabs him and starts kissing him. And shows his eyes go like that, and he almost faints. So they both fall on the ground, and Mariane is on him, kissing him. And pretty soon he falls down, and he grabs her. And Mariane is on him, kissing him. And then film ends with that. So it's gonna be funny ending, see? Huh? So how'd you come up with this ending? Huh? How'd you come up with this ending? I wish I took up short stories. Are you gonna miss me when I go tomorrow? Mmm. You better start working though, Kimi. Because things are getting worse and worse. Don't depend on the film. Where you gonna get the financing? Well, that's what's tricky, you know. I have the producers. They're supposed to get the money, but they haven't raised the money yet. So all that time you're gonna be waiting, you're wasting your life. You better go get a job or something. Well, what do you think about the fact that... Huh? It took me four years to develop the project and write the script and everything. Won't it be a waste if I just give up? Well, in the meantime you're waiting for financing, you're wasting your life. - Grandpa, I love you. - Hmm? Okay... - Okay! - I love you! Okay, you know, you better take care, and you get to work. Okay? I love you. You cannot depend on that picture. You're gonna wait forever. Okay. Yeah. [clock ticks] [phone ringing] - Hello! - Hello. - Hi, Grandpa! - Hi. - It's Kimi. - Oh! - I'm okay, how are you? - Ohhhhh. - Ohhh. - Yeah. How are you feeling? - Mmmm. - Yeah. BINGO CALLER: N-42, N-42. N-42, 42. Next number, under I-29. I-29, 29. [walker clacks over tile floor] [TV plays loudly] Last night I had... oh... spaghetti, wait no, macaroni and ground meat. Yeah, macaroni and ground meat mixed together. And I have... squash, boiled squash and... and peas. Yeah. Yeah, so. Oh, I'm enjoying the food, yeah. Grandpa, I finished that movie in Uganda. What do you call it? - "Where Are You Taking Me?" - "Where Are You Taking Me?" What happened to the Japanese one? I'm still trying to make it! -Huh? I'm still trying! Remember, you read the script? Oh, the script. What do you remember? Uh... I was gonna give you some idea how to end it. How to happily end it. That... he has to go back to Japan because the wife was sick, right? And the wife gonna pass away, so he's gonna come back. So that meanwhile, the two got together again. So they're gonna get married in the park. So that's how it's gonna end. Yeah. And what's the title gonna be? Huh? What's the title gonna be? [sings, starts too low] ♪ Someday when I'm, oh. ♪ Some day, when I'm feeling low, ♪ and when the world is cold, ♪ I will feel a glow just thinking of you, ♪ and the way you look tonight ♪ I think that's a beautiful song. How come you have such a will to live? How to? Why do you have so much will to live? Because I feel... I'm not sick! Only thing is I got cancer in my bladder, huh? Go shi shi all the time. Inconvenient, but I'm not like the other guys. They cannot eat. They're sleeping all day. I'm not paralyzed, yeah. So I feel... I'm gonna live more than six months. Yeah.
