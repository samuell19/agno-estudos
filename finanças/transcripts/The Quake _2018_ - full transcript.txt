It is a year since the mountain Åkerneset raced out in Geirangerfjorden - - and created an 80 meter high tsunami. 248 lives were lost in this brutal encounter with the natural forces. We have heard strong stories of courage, care and goodwill. But also questions about what we as society could do - - to prevent such disaster And if something similar can happen again. This week, the Geiranger Commission presented its report. Head and senior researcher in Norsar, Johannes Løberg, welcome here. How do you go out as a researcher? - When to find meaning, seek answers after such an event? When the forces that lie in nature hit us, they blindly hit us. Unfortunately, no one can say that - - Exactly when or where an earthquake will occur. Especially such a shiver as that which triggered the raid in Geiranger. On the basis of that knowledge, should people live there whatsoever? It is a huge difficult assessment. But it is useless to live in constant fear. Because we can not control nature. We live anyway in the middle of it. Løberg, we are not going to sit here alone. We invite you to a man - - which has rightly been called one after this tragedy. - Are you ready? - But before he comes, look at the pictures. Good luck. Many of those who were in Geiranger May 6 last year - - can thank one man for living today. Kindly welcome Geologist Kristian Eikjord. (Ringtone) Hello. Hello. Sorry, I'm late, so. - Did you forget me? - Forgot you? Are you crazy? No I... It's good to see you. - Should I take it? - Yes. - You're probably hungry. - Yes. Slightly. I have not been to the store, but ... - Omelette? - Yes. - Omelette and crackers? - It will be fine. How is it going home? Have you found a boyfriend? No. - Do you have? - I? No no. Do you miss mom? Yes, sometimes. It might have happened that it had gone better now? Maybe. (mobile durer) Now I'm fine here. Come on, please. Julia, please. Come. What is this? This is just something I'm dealing with. What? It's getting late. Come on, then we'll go down. - I do not understand all this. - It's impossible for you to understand. It died so many in the accident there. As many as we knew. As many as... You save my mother and Sondre. You save me. Come. Then we go down. Good morning. I have made breakfast. There is cracking bread with yellow cheese and peppers. And then I warm up the coffee from yesterday. I have also cleaned. I think it's best that you leave. - Does? Why? - You are big girl now. You realize that I can not have a visit right now. I thought I was going to go on Thursday? I think it's best for you, like Daddy, now that you go home. - I have ordered a ticket. - Come on. We pack. Come on. (Rumbling) The cause of the accident is still unknown. Police informed early on the serious accident. It quickly became clear that two people had lost their lives. The Oslo Fjord tunnel is now closed in both directions. It is unclear when it reappears. There are 32 subsea tunnels in Norway - - which has an even steeper rise than the Oslo Fjord tunnel. Many people have criticized the slope in the tunnel to be too steep. We have now verified the identity of the two deceased. The two are Inga Hansen and Konrad Lindblom. The relatives are notified. Lindblom worked as a geologist for Norsar. He should not have been involved in the construction work in the tunnel. Our reporter Mats Andersen was on the spot shortly after the event. The Oslo Fjord tunnel has been hit by ... We can not get into the tunnel but have been informed by the police - -two died in the tunnel after something fell from the ceiling. Kristian! Hello. - Hi. - Good to see you. With beard and stuff. Do not know you almost again. - Coffee? - Yes, thank you if you have. - Ingrid, do you have those copies to us? - Yes. You're welcome. I mean I've gone through everything you requested. - No rash on any of them? - No. Not a bad word about Konrad. He was a good man. But he could ... He could sometimes go a little far with alternative theories. We have never had such precise measurements as we have now. It is a level of detail that we could only dream of before. - Get the 3.8-one from Bergen last year. - Yes, let's see. Look at that. There were more raids that day? No yellow dots are man-made shakes. Construction work and blasting. Only red are confirmed earthquakes. So Norway is doing it. And if anything, Ingrid is sitting here and watching. We watched in Geiranger and. Yes. So, Kristian, we can not measure a shake before it happens. Hello? - Hello? - Here in. - Hi. - Hi. My name is Kristian Eikjord. I worked with Konrad. Yes. Then you may know that he is dead? Of course. You may be a family? Konrad is my dad. Or was my dad. I'm sorry so much. Condolences. - But you worked together? Was that so? - Yes, or ... yes. Konrad was a friend. He contacted me. I did not think Dad had any friends. Was maybe more colleague a friend then. I'm interested in his work. I need to see some papers and ... Take a look inside the work room. I have a meeting with the funeral agency. - It is okay? - Yes, yes. It's going to matter anyway. Thank you. Hello. This is Marit. Votes. Low wooden house. Next to a big yellow one. Ok yes But I'm here. Fuck me! Hi, Kristian. How do we know that the yellow dots are not really red? How do we know what is created by man or nature's own shakes? As I said, it's construction work and blasting. - Yes, but how do we know? - Entrepreneurs report it. - They report any blasting? -They report projects. So the contractor signs up for the entire building period? Yes, in principle. Is there any construction work in the Oslofjord tunnel? - Call that contractor. - Kristian, it will be a little ... Please? Do me that service, then I'll stop bothering you. If there was no construction work there that day ... ... what was it then? -I'll take some phones, ok? - Thank you. - Hi, Sondre. - Hi Dad. You have to say goodbye to Mia, my girlfriend. - Hi. - Hi. - luck to meet you here. - I live here then. Of course. Are you on your way, or? - Yes, we're going to the cinema. - Maybe we'll talk later, then? - Yes. Nice to meet you. (banking at the door) - Hi. - Hi. - How nice you were. - Thanks. It is you and. - And Julia? - She actually got up. She forgot this one. She has a general test tomorrow at the Opera. What? Is she singing? Dances the ballet. You can come and see. Do you want that? - If you have time? - Of course. Then she will be happy. It was very stupid what happened to Julia in Geiranger. We both know that I'm not very easy now. It looks so delicious to lay on the back and have a small breakdown. You should try it. It's pretty nice. Idun? What I am going to tell now, will sound completely insane. I do not want you to be afraid. Okay, it's an old farm, but it's the second time in a week. It looks okay here. A little hot, maybe. Hold it, please. Can I get some light? Hello? Can I get some light, Kristian? (high click) What do we do then? (Rattle) Idun, that's fine. It's okay. I understand why you left me. What I tried to ... Kristian. It was not me who left you. You left us. - Hi. - Hello! It will be fun to see. Mom? When does Dad come today? No, I do not know when, but he knows when it begins. Dad is coming and watching today. - Are you excited? - Good luck! - Hello? Hello? - I'm in here. - What are you doing? "Your father was doing something important. I almost have to lock and get away. Have you never had a feeling that something will happen, but you do not know what? I grew up with a father who always had that feeling. He could not drive past a rock noise without taking a bit home. Have you read it? But he's banging. Yes. He may bar at the time. He was right in that if a tribute hits Oslo today, - let's say it's not the same strength as in 1904, let's say at 6. Or 8. It is not twice as strong. It's a million times stronger. Thousands of people are going to die. I must actually move on. You found something of what you were looking for? - You can bring what you want. "It can be tough for you to hear. But there are things that are more important than a daughter. A son. A family. Okay. Nevertheless, I have to leave. I have to choose songs for the funeral of my dad. Because he was doing some important things down the Oslo fjord tunnel. Do you know why I think he was there? - No. Because he would save you. You and many others. I need to see that tunnel. I will not go down that tunnel. Do not you wonder what he did down there? This is important. Clear. You? Can not we just go? Wait. Take and hold it. Can I have some light here? - Kristian! - Coming soon. (mobile calling) Hi, Idun. - Hi. Where do you get away? - You, I'm so sorry. Are you, or? I was on my way, and then something happened so I was delayed. - Okay? Are you far away? - I ... Kristian? Are you there? Hello? Are you there? Hello?! Do you hear that I'm talking to you now? - I hear you. - Are you coming or not? -We are on our way. - What? (bumps and broke) Hello? Idun? Do you hear me? Idun? Hello? (high bang) (Sirens) Julia! Julia! Idun? Kristian ... - Hi! Have you seen Julia? - I think she's up there. - Hi, you must not be here now! - Julia! -Have you seen my daughter? -You must go out! I'm looking for my girl! She is in the show. Listen what I'm saying. There is nobody here. Everyone has gone out. It's not safe to be here now. You have to get out. Julia? (scream) Hello. Are you OK? Are you okay? My girl. Come on. We have to get out. Where is Dad? - He did not come. It goes well well. We have to get out. Come on, my girlfriend. Come on, you're fine. Came to me. Come. There you go. (Ringtone) (mobile calling) - Hello? Idun? -We are heading home. Just come. - I will be there at once. -nice. - Johannes. It was a shame, right? - What are you doing here? They contacted you. It was an earthquake, right? There has been a move, and that's what we're going to figure out now. A movement? You see what's going on here now? Now I just have to get my job done. Hi! That is Oslo. Do you know what Konrad did in the tunnel? He took rock samples. It's the stone test he did not get. Just give me a minute. Kristian, that stone there. It proves nothing. We know from before that the mountain around the Oslo Fjord tunnel is not strong. The fact that there is a race in the Oslofjord tunnel does not mean that earthquakes are on its way. It only means a new accident in Norway's most accidentally burdened tunnel. John, your yellow dots ... The shells are hidden behind the blasting. The blasts are just camouflage. See. Look at that column. It's not about blasting or camouflage. This is a construction error. The movement we recorded created the Opera itself as it collapsed. If there had been a trembling, we would not have stood here, any of us. The whole of Bjørvika is built on marine clay. It's like jelly in a child's birthday. A little puff in one corner, so it's all gonna be alright and shaking. You have a power failure. You have... There may be a thousand reasons for a power failure. I know it's not easy. You've been in the midst of a disaster. I can not imagine what you've been through. But that does not mean there are accidents wherever you are. Can you please go now? Kristian! What is going on? Go home. ... a construction error in one of the arrows can have many reasons. This is where we want to investigate carefully. It became very dramatic for the young people gathered at the Oslo Opera ... Where did you go? Why did not you come? Pardon. Sorry. But I'm here now. Why are you here? Why are you coming here? What do you want? I do not quite know. OMG. I'm looking for disasters everywhere ... We miss you. Can not you at least try to be a little dad? - Idun, you do not understand ... - What do not I understand? What I do not understand? I was in Geiranger, I and. You did everything you could, Kristian. You save a lot of people. Your family survived. We were lucky. We are here. All together. So your computer has detected that the power went into the Opera 20:05:18? And the accident itself was a few seconds later, say 20:05:30? Nice, thank you. We are talking. Hello. Can you give me time for the movement in the Opera yesterday? It is registered at 20:04:57. Yes. Oi! Shit! I just step into some water. Okay. Yes. I am on my way now. I'll look at it. I got quite wet. Hello. Hello. Are you ready for this, Dad? Whole family package and ...? I hope so. - So you get a little, or? - I hope so. Yes, that's good. - Hi. - Hi. - Hi. - Hi. - Where are you going? - I'm going to university. - Now? - Yes. Do you want food? - No. Hair. Good bye. Good bye. Are you and mom together now? To be honest, I do not know. (Bell) - Hi. - Hi. I have to show you something. Yes, that is the whole business. Explosions and greater work. In the entire Oslo area. No, there is no need to worry. We are studying urgently. Thanks for that. John? Look at this. It looks like a kind of system. A warning system. Gas. - There's gas that kills those rats! - Gas? - a limn outbreak - Hi. What kind of breakup? Toxic gases that leak out of the pores from a mountain. Lake Nyos in Cameroon, 1986. Gas? I thought it was earthquake you were afraid of? Yes, that's what I'm afraid of. And that's happening now. Go get dressed now! Nausea is a physiological process where we repel ... (mobile calling) On with the belt. We're gonna get mom. Answer then too black! (mobile durer) What? Tell then. Idun. I do not know what to say. Was not he out in the autumn vacation? Has he become normal again now? Right now he is. Yes. What happens next time he's getting weird? Hello. That's fine. (tuting) Just drive. Drive! Close cultures like England and Norway ... (mobile plings) - You. Again? - Sorry. Read it up if it's so important. Where did we go? - What is it? - Nothing. - Why do we drive so fast? -Political Emergency Phone. I have placed four bombs at the university. - They blow up in ten minutes. -In the university? - Left here! - I can not. Dad, wait. - I will be back soon. - Do not go. I will be back soon. I promise. I'm just gonna get my mom. Then you're here with Marit. Can you promise it? Please? - Marit? Watch out for Julia! - Daddy! That is correct. Hello. I'll take a look at it. Can I call you back? Idun Oakland. I have to talk to her now. There has been an accident. - Where is she? - Idun? - I think she's at 34. - 34? - 34th floor. - To hell. Inner elevator and looked all the way up. (mobile calling) Hi, Kristian. Have you not seen anything on the screens yet? Soon you will get big results. - If we are not prepared ... -We already have ... Take and call someone. Start warning people. (Beeping) -We must talk afterwards. - There will be nothing afterwards. Call any agencies. I do not know. Turn on the air lever. John? ... metaphorically speaking correctly, and then the dating process is ... (siren) Mia, we gotta get out. Now. I have a very bad feeling. Wait. Perhaps we will leave the scene? Yes, okay. Note the metaphors used on the animals that are hunting ... (Honking) - Move. I will deliver goods. "Can not you just drive past me?" I can move myself. Julia? Julia? Julia! Julia! Give me two seconds. - Hi. - You have to come along. Everyone must be out. - There's an earthquake. Now! "Kristian, be nice and calm down." We can not be here. That's the worst place to be! Come now. Kristian, calm down. If there was an earthquake, someone would know about it and alert. There is no one who alerts. Come! I'll be with you, and then we'll have a cup of coffee and talk together. Ok? Sorry everyone. Sorry, we must now leave the building! Are you aware of what such a fake alarm costs? Julia! You press the fire alarm. The elevator automatically goes down to the first floor. What is Julia doing here? - An interesting transformation ... - Come on, we're going out. - What? - You? Now I've had enough of you. - The alarm went, so if everyone goes out. - The alarm has stopped. Sit down or walk. - You should join everyone. - Sit down or just plug. Everyone goes quietly. Keep calm and walk to the stairs. Everyone must be out. No signal? (alarm) Hello? John? (scream) Down! Julia! Idun. Idun? Idun? Are you okay? Look at me. Look at me. Are you okay? Are you okay? Say something! Please. Idun? (Idun shelves) Julia! Hello. Can you hear me? Are you okay, Julia? (noise) Can you grab there? And then you go. Okay, on three. Can you go One two Three! Drag! (Idun screaming) Julia! Julia! We are going to do this here. But we have to do it together. U.S. two. There is an opening down there. Are you okay? Stay here. Press as hard as you can. (Rumbling) Julia, run up there! As soon as you can! Run! Hold on No! Grab something! Julia! (Jitter) Idun? Idun! Move! Idun? Can you move? It's going to happen afterwards, so we have to get away from here. First we need to get down and open the opening. Then we get Julia. (Idun moan) - Okay. - No. Idun? Idun? Get up. Then I will send this one over. You can do it. Come on. I welcome you. Julia is waiting up there. Come on. Come on. Get up. Come on. There you go. Very good. (Cracking,) I'll send it over now, so do you accept. Now I'm free to accept. Just hold on. I'll take you. Come on. Hold on You just have to climb a little. Just a little bit, I'll take you. - Kristian ... - Come on! Come on. I can not. Please? Please? I love you. Do not say that. Please. Just a little next door to. - You have to pick up Julia. - Idun! No! Now you climb up! A little bit! Then I'll take you. Do you hear what I'm saying? A few centimeters, then I'll take you. Please? Just a little close to. There, yes! Come! Come! Help! Help! - Marit? - We're down here! - Julia! - Daddy! She is here! Help! I come! Dad! I thought I had lost you. Let me look at you. Where is Mommy? Where is Mommy? I'm so sorry for it. You must not go. Look at me. I'll be here. I promise. Thanks. Now you must listen to me. We must get away from here. Ok? Come. (high bang) - No! - Julia! Julia! Julia! (Spalling) Dad! Julia! Dad! - Daddy! - Julia! Just stay completely quiet now! Julie! Do not move. - Marit! Go down! - I come! Dad! Marit! Marit! "I need you to take Julia. - Yes. I'm going to swing her over. Are you ready? Julia, I'm going to swing you over. I count to three. One two... ...three. - Drop! Julia, you have to let go. I hold you, Julia. You have to let me go now. - Julia, drop daddy! - Let me go.
