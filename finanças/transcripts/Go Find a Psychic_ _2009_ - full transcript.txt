When I was little, much more than now, I feel like the door to a mysterious world was always nearby. Yone... Yone! Yone. Yone. Yone. Yone! Yone! Yone. Hey! Yone, wake up! Hey! Yone! OK... Uh... Uh, well... Santa... What are you doing sleeping in here? Come on. We're on. Oh, uh... sorry. Come on damn it. Hurry. Let's get a move on already! - Ow ow ow... - Hurry up, come on already. - Wa... wait a minute... - Enough already, let's go. Oww, really, it hurts. Ow ow ow... It only hurts cause you think it hurts! - Uh, by the way... - Yeah? How did you get the door open? There's a trick to it. Come on already. Aah, wait, wait... And now for our next "Psychic-er" Ohhh... This girl's got a particularly unique air about her, doesn't she. So, what will you be doing for us today? I will be identifying the contents of a sealed envelope. Oh, here we go! X-ray vision! The power I would most like to have. Wait, don't tell me you can see all of my... - Damn it Yone, you're late. You're late, you idiot! - And here we go. Please draw whatever you'd like on this card. Anything is OK, right? Alright, here I go. - Please wait just a minute. - OK. - Let me see the envelope. - Please. Have a look. Ah, a skeptic as always. See, everything's normal, right? Well then... I will draw "that thing" that I like so much. Alright. All done. Now please place it in the envelope and seal it shut. Understood! I really did just draw something that I came up with randomly just now. And I haven't pulled any tricks. It's really in here. Oh, so you're going to read it through the envelope, right? Ah, she's looking right through it!, right? She looks like she's started at it. What amazing concentration. Did you get it? I think she's seen something! Oh, come on! I'm counting on you! Well then, inside this envelope is the picture that I drew earlier. Alright, let's open it up. Here it is, the picture I drew before... is Doraemon! I think I did a pretty good job. And the picture she drew... is the character for wind. Unbelievable. Believable. Unbelievable. Believable... So it would seem that what you wrote... is the character for wind, huh. Alright then, here we go. Let's debate! They're completely different. Well, but, you see... The bottom of the character for wind and the nose and mouth of Doraemon are a pretty close match. But Doraemon isn't wind, right? But this unexplained concurrence... how can you explain it? There's no concurrence. There certainly is! Kanji and Doraemon... Where's the concurrence? That's not what I mean. Look here. The shape of Doraemon's mouth and this part of the character for wind... Look, if you want to look at it that way The character for wind is square and Doraemon is a circle. There's nothing for us to discuss. Time's up! Well then, the results are in. With a score of 82 to 18, today's paranormal phenomenon is unbelievable. Unbelievable. - Yone! - Yes? What do you think about this show? Well, uh, I'm doing everything I can to be positive, but - Do you think it's interesting? - Yeah, of course. Huh? What the hell is interesting? What's this "Asunaro Psychic"? We're just constantly being made fun of. Where's the good in that? In the end, these are cold times Anyone who says anything strange gets laughed at Well, I... when I was a kid, I watched this paranormal show on TV and from then I constantly tried to make a spoon bend. Heck, I even still try it now sometimes. Heh, of course, I still haven't ever gotten it to bend yet. Oh well, I say "not yet", but it's not gonna bend. But, well, I, someday I, well, you see, that's why, that kind of show... These are letters from our audience all over the country Of course some of them are probably just sent in to get on TV or as a prank for laughs But I keep my eyes open for the real ones that may be mixed in And you're the one who's going to get them on camera. Huh? This is our crusade as TV entertainers. Don't come back until you've found something. Now what was I doing? What's that? You don't know? - Come on, man. - Of course I know what it is. TSUCHINOKO "Come on out, Tsuchinoko." In any case "Oh, man, it's just lotus root!" it was up to me to convince the skeptics KUSSHI who wouldn't believe anything unless they saw it with their own eyes, by continuing to search out the doors to mysterious worlds. "Just a swan!" YETI GOLEM Hello! QIGONG THERAPIST "Damn, he's just a fake!" SKYFISH TIME MACHINE Bend, spoon! (Go Find a Psychic) Hello? Oh, Yone. What are you up to? What am I up to? A national tour of the mysterious... Enough with the nonsense. Hurry on back. What are you talking about? It was your idea. Whatever. Listen, the show is about to start. Uh, well, there's really no way I can come back today... Huh? What the hell? Today's a special! But you told me not to come back until I find... Hello? What happened? It's terrible. Yone can't make it back today. - Huh? - Wha... really? What's her problem? For someone working in TV, her priorities are all screwed up! Editor-in-chief Nakamura and Professor Sotoyama are here. - Good morning! - Good morning. Oh, professor. Cut 'em all down again today. There are a lot of people out there who just can't think scientifically. Oh, editor-in-chief, looking good today. Merry Christmas! How about some delicious cake? Bye-bye. - Thank you, Santa. - My pleasure. Will you and your reindeer come to deliver me some presents tonight? Of course He'll pull the sleigh right to your house. Will you have enough time to deliver to everyone in the world? This guy's faster than any other. I'm a lot more nimble than I look. Awesome! And that's why I chose him as my reindeer. - Get on. - You wanna go for a ride? Go ahead, climb on up. I don't have the sleigh with me though. Get on. Paranormal Phenomenon Variety Show "Asunaro Psychic" Christmas Eve is finally here. Right, Kyoko? That's right, and today we're bringing you a 3 hour special! - Hold on. - Yes? - Come on, do it right. - Huh? - It's Christmas Eve. - Yeah. Let's make this show a little more romantic. This show opens the door to a world that can't be explained by science. Broadcasting live from this studio we unravel the mystery behind paranormal phenomena through heated discussion. Get a load of this. From all over Japan we invite all types of "Psychi-ers" to our studio - "Asunaro Psychic" and display their power in a live broadcast. Man, the "ESPers" who come on this show are always a disappointment. And then, based on these displays their authenticity of their power is debated. Representing the skeptic side we have Professor Sotoyama This guy's really harsh. And he doesn't even really understand any of it. Professor! And debating him, on the belief side Power publisher, editor-in-chief Nakamura. And as for this editor-in-chief Welcome, Mr. Editor-in-chief. - He'll believe anything. He'll fight for even the worst fake. I mean, there's only so much a person can believe. Hey hey hey hey, stop that. I need those for business. Sorry, it was unintentional, I was just playing with it. Sticky fingers. Oh, they're getting pretty long. Check it out, it's pretty sweet. Here we go. Ah... Oh, look look look, ahh, oh, look, there it goes, ahh... It's no fun when you do things like that. Hey! - Oh, you're early! - It's that kind of a day. - This is the guy I told you about. - Ohhh... - Hello! - Nice to meet you. I'm Shiina. Thanks for coming. I'll put some coffee on. Here, help yourself. Taiyaki. I chose the ones with red bean paste all the way to the tail. Ah, nitpicky as always. It's not nitpicky, I was just making use of my X-ray vision. You consciously chose them? - Hey, Shiina, come join us. - Oh, OK... You watch this stuff? - Today's a special. - Ohh... Your buddy was on there last week, wasn't he? She's not my buddy. How do you mistake Doraemon with the character for wind? Enough with the excuses. You guys all watch it. Whatever. That's enough for today. And now to Nakazaki on relay. Hello, this is Nakazaki. I'm standing up here on the roof of the studio. Today we'll be witness to a monumental paranormal phenomenon. A sacred night, a night of miracle you might say Tonight we wait in anticipation for the door to a new world to be opened. Alright... Shiina. You're still not sure if you believe in us or not, huh? No, well... This is Ide. He can control electronic devices. I'm Ide the electrokinesist. I'm not very good with household appliances though. - This is Kawaoka. - Hey! As you can see, he uses psychokinesis. Look, it's moving more that you expected, right? Pleased to meet you. It's that kind of a place. Yo! Hey, hey! We've been waiting for you! Hello. Oh, over here, over here. - Oh, OK, thanks. - Please. - I'll be right over. Nice to meet you, I'm Yone Sakurai. I'm the Cool, Calm, and Collected Guy. Uh, I, uh, don't have a business card. Oh, don't worry about it. Thanks again. Thank you. So, uh, depending on the outcome of this I'll be on prime time, right? Uh, yeah, that's right. Depending on the results. Ohhh! I'm getting nervous. I'm starting to get nervous. Really!? Prime Time!? Prime Time!? First, let me get some information from you. This is great! Talk about a development. Yeah yeah, but, uh, first, let's just talk a little about what you do. Uh, hold on, excuse me. Uh... are you stripping? Huh? Am I ugly? OK, imagine some kind of scene. Anything is OK? Anything that pops into your head is fine. Now concentrate hard. Ide, I get the feeling you are surrounded by beautiful women at the beach. Oh! That's right. Kawaoka, it's like you're sinking into a sea of money... Amazing! This is true telepathy. And by the way, what's up with you guys and your greedy images? How about me? I don't really understand it, but... Let's see... There's a pregnant woman standing in front of the Statue of Liberty and she seems to be looking at something. You got it! He's right? That was exactly it. Anyway, what the hell kind of image is that? Well, I don't know, it just kind of popped into my head. So there's no special meaning to it or anything? No. It really felt like there was some deep symbolism. So, it's like you can sense what we're thinking? Yeah, well, if you're thinking hard about something anyway. Wow, wait, this could be even better than X-ray vision. Of course it is. X-ray vision's pretty lame, huh? Hey, wait a minute. Come on, X-ray vision's great. I mean the taiyaki, look, you ate some right? The body! Geez, how much can you guys eat? I don't know, this feels a little strange. I've never done this in public before. Yeah, usually you're not so quick to use your powers, right? Wait wait wait, you use your powers all the time. No I don't. Just today, he sent the factory chief flying. - The factory chief? - You sent him flying!? He just kept demanding more and more and I lost my temper. Was he OK!? Well, I was pretty panicked. Yeah, of course you'd be panicked. What a thug. This guy uses his powers all the time too. No, well, with me it's, you know. Winning free drinks from vending machines and stuff, just little things like that. But isn't that a crime? It's not a crime. I'm just praying for a win. What's up? Who's that? If I made a drink come out without putting any money in, that would be a crime. As a commemoration. Ohh... you've all got your own lines that you won't cross, huh? How about you Kake, you must take peeps at people's naked bodies. - I do not. - Wait wait wait... - Huh? - Come on, you look. Of course he does. Come on, how could you not? You guys have got a pretty distorted view of X-ray vision. But you do look through the sealed pages of the girly mags, right? - I'm telling you, I don't look! - How about like the mosaic on porn? Anyway, it's not like there's an unedited picture behind the mosaic. All you'd see would be the inside of the cathode ray tube. Yeah yeah yeah I just always thought X-ray vision equaled perverted What kind of equation is that!? This right here... is a poisonous spider from Tanzania. Even if I'm stung, I stay cool, calm, and collected. Please, go ahead. OK Are you alright? Cool, calm, and collected. And, just like that, everyone... was drawn in by the name and started hanging out here. Cafe du Nenriki (Psychic Powers) That's why I chose the name. - To gather "ESPers"? - Yeah. Yeah, but, with this name you're more likely to drive away regular customers. - You think? - Yeah, I mean... It's kinda hard to bring yourself to enter a place called Cafe du Nenriki. Yeah, it's pretty sketchy. Well, it was originally a bit more vague. Huh, like what? Like on the menu, instead of espresso, it was ESPresso... But no one really noticed. Of course not. They probably figured it was just a regular mistake. Well, whatever, that's why I came up with this name. By the way, how did you two meet? It was definitely a fated encounter. There was no toilet paper in the office toilet. And I really started to panic... Then all of a sudden, someone slid some toilet paper in. That someone was me. You see... He read my mind through the door knob. That's how you guys met!? That's right. I ran away almost immediately, but then later... he confronted me, "You're an 'ESPer' aren't you"? How did you know? At that very moment, I saw his face with my X-ray vision. What a horrible way to meet. No it's not! A miracle was born from these two "ESPers" You could really feel his impatience? I couldn't ignore it. Ah, whatever, it's nice. Because of that, we were all able to meet. That's right. It's pretty amazing, right? And what's more, we've got another new member joining us this year. They're pretty good huh? They may be the best thing so far. This is unforgivable. We're all regular customers. When are they coming? It could be pretty much any time now. They've gotta be pretty brave to show up late. I wonder, is he using Musashi's tactics? Ganryuijma. (Miyamoto Musashi showed up late to his battle with Sasaki Kojiro at Ganryujima) Well, whatever, he'll be here sooner or later. Well, sorry guys, but I have to go out for a bit. - Where are you going? - Don't worry, I'll be right back. Enjoy yourselves. I wonder what's up. It's gotta be rough for him. Closing the place down every year on Christmas Eve Nah, no one would come to a place like this anyway. Don't let him hear you say that. Master's not an "ESPer" though, right? He's an ordinary person. Yeah, but, he's apparently been practicing. Practicing? He goes running every morning in that track suit - In that thing? - Yeah. But what do you mean? Can you become an "ESPer" by running? Well, I don't know, but... Why did he start up a place like this anyway? I don't know, he was apparently helped out by someone way back. - By an "ESPer"? - Yeah. He doesn't seem to remember their name or face though. And that's why he decided on that name for this place. Maybe someday that person will find their way here. Oh, is that right? It would be great if everyone was like him. Master's a pretty special person. Recently it seems we've been getting treated worse and worse, doesn't it? It's all because of that damn show. "Asunaro Psychic" Whatever, whatever, let's just have some fun tonight. This party's looking to be pretty amazing. Should we make it an "ESPer" party? Oh... Uh, what do you mean? What's an "ESPer" party? Hey, what do you mean, an "ESPer" party? Figure it out... Mr. Cool, calm, and collected! Mr. Cool, calm and collected! Hey! Are you OK!? Get an ambulance... An ambulance, right? Gotcha. Ah, hello? Um, excuse me... I need you to send an ambulance. Pri... prime... prime time... The Cool, calm and collected guy... isn't really all that cool, calm and collected. Hold on... Uhh... Could you be..the one with the unique power. Uh, yeah... Please, come in! It's you... - He does seem pretty special. - Hey... The master just took off for a minute. - Oh, did he? - You're a little late, aren't you? So, what's your name? - Kanda. - Oh, Mr. Kanda. So, then, you're all... Of course we are. Rivals. Yeah, I guess we might be. We've heard a lot about you. Seems you're pretty special. Well, I don't know about special... But I certainly have no intention of losing. That's a pretty big statement. Well, then, let's get to it. - Yeah, sounds good. - Right? - Get right to what? - Displaying our abilities. - Oh... - You didn't hear? - Oh, well, it's not a problem... Right, then you can be the main event. And we'll all show you our abilities first. Yeah, yeah, that'll be good. Alright then, let's get a look at your skills. Oh, what a charming guy... (sarcastic) OK, well, why don't I start us off. Top Batter! Nice to meet you, I'm Ide the Electrokinesist. Electrokinesis? Well, you know, you've got some electronics... And then doodoodoodoo, just like that I control them Something like that Well then... What's this guy doing? Anyway, something like that. - You pushed yourself a bit hard there. - He did say he wasn't great with household electronics... Yeah, but I wasn't going to lose to you guys. It would've been faster just to turn it on with your hand. Well, yeah, I guess so. Looks like another sketchy one today. Well then, let's go live to the scene. Uh, this is Okazaki reporting from up here on the roof. And just over here is the guy who's going to bring us a Christmas Eve miracle the man who can communicate with space, UFO-man. Hello. So, tonight you're going to summon a UFO, is that right? If all goes well. There you have it, on this live broadcast we may just get to see a UFO. Ah, if it comes, it comes, but it won't be his doing. - You're one to talk, Mr. Remote Control. - Huh? Come on, fess up. Where's the remote? Are you mocking me? Come on, you gotta admit it's pretty cool! Yeah, but if you had that power wouldn't you be out getting free loans from the ATMs. Oh, come on, that would be illegal. He doesn't think things through very much, huh? Yeah, you're right. Alright, who's up next? See, in the end you used your hand to turn it off. Well, I guess I'll go. Oh, here we go. I'm Shiina, the telepath. Te... telepathy? I just showed the rest of them a little while ago. Alright, Kanda. Can you remember what you had for lunch? My lunch... oh, yeah... It's all gonna come out. Heh heh, telapathy, huh? Heh heh. Microdiet. So? He's right. - It's pretty shocking, right? - Don't you get hungry? I thought the same thing myself. - Is there something on my face? - On your face? - Yeah, powder or something? - No, there's nothing there. - No powder? - Nope, nothing there. I told you, it was telepathy. Right? That's a pretty nasty reaction, don't you think? He's not even impressed by telepathy. Wow, he's setting the bar pretty high... Hey, Koyama Hey, Master, sorry I'm running so late. Everyone else has already arrived. Oh, but I thought I should come pay my respects to Kobo Daishi first. Oh, of course! You're following in his footsteps after all. Yeah. Here goes. Nike And just like that... I'm Kake of the X-ray Vision. Huh? How about that? Looking right through leather. Pretty good, huh? Alright, last but not least, it's my turn. Wait wait wait wait, hold on just a minute! Show a little more enthusiasm for my X-ray vision. Well, I mean, really, X-ray vision isn't really all that... It's kinda plain, isn't it? Yeah, maybe, but... Heck, I feel like I could probably do it. - Yeah. - Come on, cut it out. There's no way you can do it. I don't know why, but it just isn't all that impressive. X-ray vision... Wa... was that really just X-ray vision? See....see, see... That's the kind of reaction I was looking for. You don't really have to be that excited. Well then, I'm Kawaoka the Psychokinesist. Alright, let's see... Let's liven things up with a little champagne. I'll remove this cork without using my hands. Are you gonna be OK? You've always had some problem with subtle, more complex motions, haven't you? I've been practicing. Well, something like that anyway... - You scared me. - What happened? I put a little too much power in at the end there. Kanda, are you alright? Kanda? Cat got your tongue? You're up next. Ah, I'm sorry I've got it all taken care of... uh... Ah... I'm cool, calm, and collected after all. Alright, well then, I've got some more people to meet. Thanks a lot. Take care of yourself. Uh, well, uh, umm, uhh, how did I do? How was I? Prime time... Looks like things are pretty rough or both of us. And on Christmas Eve... - You too? - Yeah. Hold on, uh, well, mine's not really all that special. Enough with the modesty. - Hurry. - Yeah, alright, well then, uh... My ability is something called "Thin Man" - Thin Man? - Yeah, like a man who's thin. I've never heard of anything like that. Oh, well, the name is an original creation. - So, what kind of power is it? - Well, I don't know if I'd really call it a power... I mean, yeah, well... The main thing is I can get through really narrow spaces and stuff. It's that kind of a skill. Anyway, I guess the best way would be just to show you. Alright, over here by these posts. I can't even begin to imagine what this is gonna be like. He may have surpassed the limits of man. It really isn't all that amazing. Alright... here goes. Something... like that... Oh, warming up, huh? You're just pulling our leg. Alright, now for the real thing. Uh..well... that was kinda it... Come on, that wasn't really a special ability, was it? You're just a guy with a thin body. Yeah. It's not a special ability. I'm back. Who's this? Uh... excuse me! Hey hey Oh, hey, wait wait. You guys are all pretty amazing. So, in other words, you're not an "ESPer"... Yeah, that's right. I'm a pretty surprising person. So you don't have any special powers? Nope, not at all. I'm just a regular, uninteresting thin man. So, uh, why is he here? The sign said closed, didn't it? I was just peeking in real quick and you invited me in. It wasn't me. Come on, we were all mistaken. So, you mean, today, there's an "ESPer" party? Wow, so you guys really exist. Sorry, I just have a lot to learn. Uh, well, actually, we've all kinda been lying. Yeah. We're actually all just just a bunch of fakes, charlatans. Yeah. Come on, you're all "ESPers". No matter how you look at it, you're definitely "ESPers" Please stop using that word. Oh, and by the way, I was just using a remote before. You didn't have any remote. Oh, and that microdiet thing... - you had some microdiet powder on your face. - No, I didn't. I washed my face after. I just remembered. You'd be surprised how much you can figure out through perception and intuition. - Come on, that wasn't just intuition. You saw right through my jacket. Sometimes champagne just explodes. Yeah... What's with these lame theories? It's was clearly psychic phenomena. At any rate, it was all just a big prank. We've got a pretty nasty hobby, huh? Sorry. We're really sorry. Hello. I'm Koyama the Teleporter. Sorry I'm so late. Huh? Did I scare you guys? Master Oww, that's hot! I guess there's nothing we can do about you seeing that. If people find out that we can do these things, it will be a big problem. - Yeah. - Huh? Our lives will become really difficult. It's pretty hard for people to deal with "ESPers" Oh oh oh We'd just like you to promise us something/ - Promise? - Yeah. That you'll never tell anyone about what you saw. Oh... It would really help us if you would just keep it all locked inside. Ohhh... - So? - Sure, I won't say a thing. Really? Well, yeah, it would bad if I said something, right? - Yeah. - So I won't say anything. Really, I won't say a thing. Consider it a promise. From here on out. - Take a look. - OK. Huh? What? What is this? So? The words "I'll tell." are fluttering around. - Hold on! - You're gonna tell. - Stay out of my head! - He's dying to tell someone. Did you really think you could deceive us? No no no, you've got it all wrong, you see... Really, I'm not gonna say anything. I swear. - You swear? - Yeah, I've completely changed my mind. Feel free to look again if you need to. So? - I see 5,000 yen bills coming out like this towards me - Come on... Are you trying to bribe us? You're lying again? - Please don't hurt me. - More importantly, 5,000 yen? Anyway, it looks like there's no way for us to talk this out. No, no, that's not true. Hold on... first... uh... I gotta pee.. - Hey old man. - Yeah? - Come outside. - What do you want? I'm busy. I said come here. And I'm not an old man. This is ridiculous, no matter how you think about it. - What do you mean? - The bean paste. There's almost no bean paste in these things. That's cause someone took all the good ones earlier. Oh, come on... The chances of that happening are slim to none. Uh... excuse me. - Uh... this address.. - Later. - Hi, can I get you some taiyaki? - Oh, by the way, you guys want some white bean paste? - I want some black bean paste. - Come on, white bean paste. - It doesn't matter whether it's black or white. - Of course it matters. Anyway old man, you've been skimping, haven't you? - I have not! - He has, right? Anyway, how did this all happen? It's because you were so late! Are you saying it's my fault!? And what was with that performance? Suddenly teleporting in here... It was all Master's idea! I'm really sorry. So about your teleport ability, could you, for example... do something like that send that guy to another dimension? Ohh... no, no, no, I mean... my teleportation is really more like I'm just stopping time. - Stopping time? - Yeah. Like just now, I stopped time for a second and then while it was stopped, I came in. Huh? Really? 1... 2... 3... So how long does it last? Hmm, about 5 seconds at the most. And once I use it I've gotta rest for a bit. Pretty useless, huh? No, it's not. It's pretty convenient. Like right now, I'm working in an udon shop, yeah? Say a piece of hair inadvertently falls into the udon and then someone starts complaining, I just quickly stop time and take out the hair. - You're not listening. - So what are we gonna do about him? It'll be a real problem if we can't get him to keep quiet. Yeah, maybe. But he doesn't seem like he's all that bad a person. Let's just try a little more to settle things more peaceably. - Kake? - Did you see something? - Oh, hey... - What do you think you're doing? - I just dropped some coins... - There's no way you "just dropped" them out there! Something's just not right. You sure you weren't just seeing things? I'm telling you, there really was a hair in there. If there wasn't, I wouldn't have complained. Really? Uh, well, I noticed something strange too. - What do you mean? - That employee you complained to... Right in front of my eyes, he suddenly warped slightly to the side. - What? - No, really. Yeah, see, he was standing there like this looking at the udon. Then all of a sudden, he moved like this... Oh, I'm sorry. - Excuse me. - No, I'm sorry. Are you OK? - Are you OK? - Uh, excuse me, you're bag... I'm really sorry. No, it's OK, don't worry about it. I'm really sorry. For right now, just hang out over there. I've already been reconsidering... Quit whining. I feel a little bit bad for him. It's his own fault, he had it coming. I mean he wasn't even really the Thin Man. - That's right. - But this... I guess it's pretty tough to keep someone quiet after all. Perhaps... do you think you could do something with your powers to fiddle with his brain? - What do you mean? - Well, I don't know, I mean... They say there's these electrical currents running through your brain, right? Ohhh... So could you like tweak his memories or something? Uh, well, I mean even with a Game Boy Sometimes when I try to do real complex things, it often goes a little buggy. So if you think about it that way... Yeah, it wouldn't be good if things were buggy. I'd imagine it would be a bit more complex than a Game Boy. What do you mean buggy? It wouldn't really be a problem if things went buggy, would it? What do you mean buggy? Well, how about if we take Shiina's telepathy just start full on judging his mind and kinda drive him crazy... Yeah, but it probably wouldn't be good for us to drive him crazy. Oh... How about Kake uses his X-ray vision... Do you think you could see cancer? Even if I did, it wouldn't mean he'd die right now. Besides, I'm not sure I could. Um, guys, excuse me for a minute. I do have rights you know. - Just sit there and be quiet. - Oh, sorry. You don't really have all that many rights. Oh, how about this What if we somehow give him a psychic power? Huh? Then he'd be an "ESPer" too. - Just like the rest of us. - Yeah. It not like it's something we can just teach him. But there is a possibility. And if it works, Kanda could be part of our group. Is there anything you think you may be able to do? Hmmm, well... I guess I may be able to use X-ray vision. - Why would you think that? - Well, I mean it is... the least the difficult of all them, right? - Come on, it's not like you guys can do it. - Just forget about it for now. - Please, teach me how to use X-ray vision! Please! - When I watched you guys before, it seemed like the coolest power. - Please, I'm begging you. Teach me. I mean it. Your X-ray vision really was the coolest. Oh, mom, sorry. Here. Um, excuse me. This address... Oh, sorry. Could you help me for a minute? - Oh, sure... - I don't what's going on, this thing's all buggy - Buggy? - Yeah. Thank you. Come on mom, hurry. Come on back. If you can't do this, I won't agree to teach you. Why are you so angry? More importantly, why do you have these with you? Oh, I get it, it's so he can practice. Heheh... - Alright then... - Yes? First, focus your full attention. - OK. - Then form an image in your head. Wa..wait a minute Master, I'll do it. Oh, right, sorry. So what should I do? Well... - First, focus your full attention - That's exactly what he just said. Well, there's no other way to say it - So then he was teaching him fine. If you can't do this, you'll end up like that champagne bottle. - Hold on a minute. - If you put him under that kind of pressure... Man, this guy's pretty scary. - Enough already, just focus. - Oh, right. Triangle. If you don't get the next one... champagne. Anyway, first off, lose the shades. - Huh? - Pretty half-hearted, huh? - You're not taking this X-ray vision thing seriously, are you? - No no no, it's not that. And what's with the shades inside anyway? No, it's not that, it's just my sign. Your sign? Wait, are you by chance meeting someone? No no no, not really. Who is it? It's not really like that. Ah... I'm here. - Hurry up and call it off! - Triangle. Hurry! I... uh... don't have my phone... - Sure you do. Right here! - Star. Ah... um... are you closed? Uh... is there someone here... let's see... Kan...? Are you Kanda? Yes. Oh, sorry I'm so late. I'm Sakurai from Wangan TV. Nice to meet you. Did you notice the sign? Oh... yeah... - Wangan TV? - Media? I kept getting held up along the way Are you here to meet with Kanda? Yeah, that's right, as research for a TV show. - A TV show? - Yeah. It's a TV show about psychic phenomena called "Asunaro Psychic." One that's on now? Yeah. And Kanda here sent in a letter. That's right. A letter to get on the show? - As Thin Man? - Yeah. If you've got something to show me, by all means... Alright, well then let's head over to where I can show you. - Yeah, sounds good. - It's just right over there. - Oh, really? - Yeah yeah. - What are you talking about? - Right this way... There's some perfectly spaced fence around here somewhere, right? A fence? Yeah, over by this pond near here. - Thin Man...? - Yeah, Thin Man. He's gonna show off his Thin Man ability at that fence. That's right. Let's go! OK. - Was there a fence around here? - Huh? Nope, no fence that we know of... Yeah yeah There's not? - Sure there is. - They tore that down a while ago, didn't they? Oh, that's right. Yeah, it seems like they didn't really need it. In this town... there aren't any fences that I can think of. - See. - Come on, there's gotta be somewhere... Can't you just do it right over here? He often does it here, doesn't he? This is kind of like his "home ground". Oh, is that so? - This'll do fine, right? - Uh, well, I guess it's OK... Uh... well then... would it be OK for me to do the interview in here? Of course! Right, Master? Yeah, please, go right ahead. We were all just having a party. Oh, that's why you're closed. Yeah. Oh! We better clean up the Uno cards. Oh, yeah. Yeah, we don't have enough for all of us to play, huh? Allow me to introduce myself again. Sakurai from Wangan TV. Sakurai... Yone? - Yeah. - Ohh... It's kind of an old lady's name... Yeah, isn't it? I'm always a bit embarrassed. This situation can't get any worse. And now the media of all things... Oh, talking about names... This place has a pretty strange name too, huh? Yeah, it does, doesn't it? I thought it would be perfect for today's meeting. What's the history behind it? Huh? Oh... uh..well.. It was like a punishment for a losing... A punishment? Yeah, we kinda got stuck with the name change. Yeah, it did happen like that, huh? - Yeah. - It was like a showdown between cafes. - Oh, that's pretty rough. - Right? Huh? Oh, yeah, it was a pretty big blow. You were pretty late, huh? Oh, yeah, sorry, I had a little trouble earlier. - Trouble? - Yeah, the guy I was interviewing before ended up in the hospital. - The hospital? - Yeah. The Cool, Calm, and Collected Man. He said he could get bitten by a poisonous spider and he'd still be cool calm and collected. But it seems like he went a little bit past his limits. - Ohh... - Pushed himself a little hard, huh? - Yeah, something like that. - So then any ability is OK even if it's not supernatural? He just sounds like a guy with a strong constitution. Your rivals just decreased by one. Oh, sorry. Well then... let's just start with a spoken interview if that's OK. OK Is that alright? - Please... - Thanks... Well then, first off tell me about how you first came to realize you had a power. OK. Hmmm, let's see... Hmmm....the first time... uhh....well to start... uh... when I was born I was premature. Oh... I see... And also, let's see, I only weighed about 1800 grams. And the doctor said I was kind of a miraculous child. - A miraculous child... - That's what he said. I mean that's what he said anyway. Miraculous... And then, I guess it was about when I was 5... I got the measles and I quickly lost quite a bit of weight. Oh..so you kept losing weight... Yeah, you know... there's more though... And then, when I was about 7...? Uh... what was that!? I don't know, looked the light bulb died. Please continue. Uh, well, anyway, I went through a bunch of stuff like that and ended up like this. I raised the pressure a bit. - Don't be so reckless! - Yeah, come on, don't use your ability! - You'll end up on that show. - Oh... yeah... Oh, well, why don't I just go ahead and show you my ability... Yeah... sure... That way would be better, right? It'll be much easier to understand. OK, well then, please go ahead. Alright, I'll just do it right here then. It's not all that great an ability. - It's a pretty boring ability. - Come on guys, cut it out. Ah, whatever, anyway... is it OK for me to start running the camera? - Ah... you wanna start now. - Yeah. So then this is the critical moment, huh? Oh, yeah, I guess so. Tada! Uh... um... it's really not a big deal if you're in the shot too. No no no no - We really don't want to be videotaped. - We all believe in the theory that the camera steals your soul. Go ahead and tape Kanda... Well then, please. OK... Uh... um... I think the lens cap is still on. - Oh, sorry! - It is, right? - Forgive me. Bit of a scatterbrain, are you? No, I really will do a good job. - Please! The camera! - Sorry. Alright, this time for real. OK 5 seconds... 4... 3... OK then... here I go... And there you have it. The Thin Man. Oh, you meant there? - Huh? Oh... yeah... here... - I thought... you know... here... Huh? No, come on, that would be impossible, right? - Oh... yeah, I guess it would be, huh? - Yeah. I'm not full of cotton, you know. Your expectations were a bit high. This width is pretty much the limit. Well, for people... So, it's not really a supernatural ability, but more like... Yeah, I guess, more like a surprising person... Yeah, that's it. - Thank you very much! What's this? Looks like rejection. Well, that's not really certain yet... If need be, maybe someplace just a little narrower I think I can do it if I really try. - Uh... well... - If you know of some narrow place... It's alright... Ohhh... - She seems a little indifferent. - Oh... no... it's not that... I got some good footage. Thank you very much. Don't mention it. Ah... well then, for now here's a commemorative pen. - Oh... a pen? - Ooh, that's pretty nice. Oh, also, if you come to visit the studio, you'll also receive this nice sticker. Doesn't look very good for him, huh? Just the normal treatment for a regular viewer. Ah, can't be helped I guess. Well, there's still that tighter spot... Maybe you should try again when you manage to fit through there. There's no way I can fit through something like that. - Excuse me. - Yes? About that poisonous spider you mentioned before... it didn't happen to escape, did it? Oh, no, I think it's OK. You think? Yeah, well... I left it to Cool, Calm, and Collected Man So what color was it anyway? Black. Did something happen? Uh... no, I'm just interested. Thank you. - What's up? - Uh, well... it's uh, here. - Here? - The poisonous spider. - Where is it? - Uh well, that's just it... It's in the business card holder in the inner pocket of her jacket. Business card holder? Yeah. I was just thinking I'd check out her business card and I came across the spider. You know, with the X-ray vision... What should we do? Why'd you have to find something like that? It's not my fault I saw it. Yeah, but when she took out her card earlier there wasn't anything in there then. Maybe it's dead. No, it didn't fall out, so it must have been holding on inside. It might bite her the next time she opens it up. Yeah, you're right. Well then, thanks again. - Are you leaving? - Yeah, I'm all finished. There's no real rush. - It's Christmas Eve. - Yeah. - Ah, yeah, but I really need to head back to the office in Tokyo - Ohh... - You're pretty busy, huh? - Thanks again. Oh, that ability! Ah, that's right. Didn't you tell her? - Oh yeah, that one you were holding aside. - What are you talking about? Wait, you didn't tell her? It's no good if you don't tell her. It's definitely much better than the Thin Man thing. Um, excuse me but... would you mind telling me more? See. That more amazing thing... Umm... - Here you are. - Oh, thanks. - And for you. - Thank you. Maybe you should just tell her the truth. I mean, you did see it. - Kake. - I can't. How should I tell her? I mean, she's with the media. - Alright, could you please tell me. - Oh, right. I've also got this other ability I call Rolling Stone. - Rolling Stone? - Uh, yeah, well, see the main point is I get inside a sports bag, but that's not all. While inside I curl up into a ball and roll around. - Ohh... - It's like that. For example is it OK if I borrow this for a minute Yeah, no problem. Oh, there's quite a bit in here. Oh, heh, yeah... Uh, if it's OK, I'm gonna empty it. Is that alright? Uh... sorry, just this Oh, sorry. The point of this is to kill the spider, right? - Yeah, that's true. Why? - Do you have some idea? Well... - No! - You can't handle subtle complex motions. I was just gonna squish it. It'll turn out just like the champagne before. Oh, yeah... - Oh, it's nothing. - Please continue. And, well, this'll look like a rolling stone. So I call it the "Rolling Stone" Oh, I see... Yeah - That was close. - We can't use our abilities. Yeah, but that's not a bad idea. We just have to kill it without her knowing. - Yeah. - That's just it... Koyama! - Huh? - The Time Stop! - Just go over there and crush it and then come back over here. - Yeah. You've already recovered, right? Yeah, but I only have 5 seconds... - 5 seconds is more than enough. - Just like taking the hair out of that udon. I'll have it done in 3 seconds. It'll really be bad this time if I get caught. 1... 2... 3... alright! - 2 looks a little difficult. - It'll be fine. I've got an extra 2 seconds if I need them. Crush the spider and give her a kiss. If I've got the time! Just go ahead and zip it right up. It's not... Alright, then I just curl up like this and roll around. 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... So, then, it's basically not that different from the Thin Man. Yeah, I guess you can say that. They both use my body as the main point. Did everything go alright? Yeah... I mean, I didn't get caught. - Were you successful? - Yeah.... - But it's still there. - Sorry. You didn't do it? No... I mean, I was really close. You had 5 seconds, where were you wandering to? - Well... - You said 5 seconds was plenty of time. - Well, it's just... - See, I told you it was pretty useless. So let me see if I've got this.. - Yeah. - Basically... you just climb inside a sports bag and roll around, right? Oh, well you see, I've been doing it since I was a kid I used to play inside this bag in the alley and this one time I got chased by a dog. So while still in the bag... I rolled away from the dog. I've got a bunch of stories like that. Why don't I go ask her for her jacket? - But I wonder if she'll take it off. - Yeah, she's been wearing it the whole time. Well, what if, like in "The North Wind and the Sun" Oh, the old Aesop fable? We should present her with a situation where she'll naturally take off her jacket. Yeah. Alright, I'll be the wind! - No! - The wind lost, right? - We need to be the sun. - Ohh... We could use the air conditioner to slowly raise the temperature of the room. - And then when she gets hot, she'll take her jacket off. - Yeah. And then you can go over and collect her jacket, Master. - This might just work. - Master, where's the remote? O... over there... Of all places... Ide, can't you just operate it from over here? - Huh? - You know, your ability... Electrokinesis Ohh... Yeah, but, I'm not really very good with household electronics. Oh, come on, just give it a shot. But, I mean, an air conditioner from this distance...? No way. You can do it. I mean you're the guy who turned the TV on before. Well, can I ask you guys to cover me? Cover? When I really concentrate, I can't see anything around me. It would be really bad if she sees me. We'll take care of it for you. - Please! - Sure. Oh, come to think of, I can fit through a hanger too. Oh... I can fit through a hanger too. Oh, so you're Thin Woman? No no no, I wouldn't say that... Well, but you... could... be... Uh... right...? - Ide. - Hey, Ide. She's looking. Ide really does love his coffee. Yeah, it's an addiction. If you need some, just ask for it. Master, please, some coffee for Ide... - A pitcher. - Coming right up. - Please, continue. - We'll have this sorted out in just a minute. - It's just withdrawal. - Please, go ahead. You really don't need to worry. OK... - What we're talking about? - Yeah... - That's as hot as it goes. - Good work. - That was pretty amazing! - You don't think she suspected anything? No no no... Cause I really can't see anything around me Thanks for waiting. What's that? - Don't say anything, just drink. - Huh? Wow... It's getting pretty hot in here all of a sudden, huh? Yeah... Again? This air conditioner is always breaking. Always goes to the highest setting and won't shut off. - Yeah. - Oh, really? - I'm begging you, fix it already. - Huh? Oh... sorry. Why don't we take our coats off? When it gets like this, there's nothing else to do. What about you Sakurai? Aren't you hot? Please feel free to take your jacket off. Ah, but I should be going soon. Don't say that. Have you already finished with Kanda? Yeah, I, uh, think I've heard quite enough. Thank you all again. Oh, by the way. I can predict the future. Predict the future? You can? Master's been training for a while, hasn't he? - Yeah, he can predict the future. - Aren't you a little curious? Oh... yeah! If you flip a coin I can guess the result 5 out of 6 times. 5 out of 6 times, huh...? You're a little better than that, aren't you? - I've told you before, that's still all I can do. - One more time. - 5 out of 6 times is a pretty good achievement. Uh... but for our show... - What the? Kanda, what are you doing? Me!? Don't be so reckless. It's because he was rejected I bet. Sakurai's the wrong person to be getting mad at. I'm sorry. I lost my temper. - Man... - I'm sorry. Oh, quick, it's gonna stain, take it off. We'll take it next door and get it all cleaned up. Yeah. Kanda's always doing stuff like this. - Hurry while we've got it. - That move was a bit sloppy. It looks like it worked out alright. - It's inside here, huh? - Yeah. As soon as you open it, it'll be right there. Here goes. Did you get it? I really am sorry. Ah, well, it's all in the past now. Let's turn on the TV. Yeah. It's great when humankind is bright and sunny but when we are cloudy and overcast, it's not so. It's been about 2 hours so far UFO-Man is continuing to send his thoughts Hehe, "Asunaro Psychic" He's been at this for quite a while, huh? I wonder if a UFO is really gonna come. You didn't by chance mistake this character for a spider, did you...? Uh, well, I mean, in Mincho font, it does look quite a bit like a bug. And it does have like 8 legs... Sorry. This is a bigger mistake than Doraemon and the character for wind. I really blew it. Sorry. Oh, and why were you looking at her business cards anyway? Because... uh... you see... I thought I'd check her out. You know... that she was Sakurai... from uh, Wangan TV. No no no no... It's not like that. Really, really, that was it. Come on, I wouldn't try to get a free peek. You guys are way too suspicious of X-ray vision. Wait, no no no... If we can all become bright and sunny, we should be able to create a blue sky without a single cloud. Let's give it a try. Let's aim for that cloudless blue sky. Not a single cloud. Let's all try. And then the sky will look down on us and say "Alright, today is the perfect weather for a picnic." Well... that's it... In the end we weren't able to see any UFOs. Now, back to the studio... Hey you, give us our time back. No, no, there was just bad reception today. He's not a cell phone. Don't laugh! A UFO is definitely gonna come. There are a lot of things that can't be explained by science. - Unbelievable. Unbelievable... - Hey... if we're to believe that that means Santa is real too. Santa IS real! Unbelievable. Unbelievable... Are you for real? This is getting pretty bad. He's getting beaten down pretty bad, huh? But, I mean, for the most part, there's no way supernatural phenomenon really exist. Don't you think so? Unbelievable. Unbelievable... If you just believe, there will certainly come a day when you can see. This is the first time the editor-in-chief has been this excited. - 800 yen... - Thank you. - Can I have a receipt please? - Sure. - Make it out to Wangan TV. - Understood. Thanks everyone, for everything. What was all of this? Ridiculous. This stupid pervy "ESPer"... Come on, enough with the "pervy ESPer" stuff Hey, Shiina, check real quick to make sure she doesn't suspect anything. You know, with your telepathy. - Pervy "ESPer" - Not so loud! - This pervy "ESPer" - Thank you very much. - To remember this... - Huh? It's OK. Unbelievable. Unbelievable... Unbelievable. Unbelievable. Unbelievable. Unbelievable. Unbelievable. Unbelievable. Unbelievable. Unbelievable. Falling Object in the Islands. "Mysterious Ball of Light" was a Fireball Where is the meteor? The "Phantom Light" was a meteor? Unbelievable. Unbelievable. Unbelievable. Unbelievable. The man who can communicate with UFOs; UFO-Man Humankind... These are cold times... Anyone who says anything strange gets laughed at - Yone! - Unbelievable. Unbelievable... Will you come deliver presents tonight? It's your crusade. Don't return empty handed. Nnnn, cool, calm, and collected. Santa IS real. Unbelievable. Unbelievable... And here it is....the character for wind. Unbelievable. Unbelievable... There you have it. The Thin Man. Unbelievable. Unbelievable... If you just believe, there will certainly come a day when you can see. I can predict the future. Alright. Today is... perfect weather for a picnic. We've waited for a long time, and still no UFO. He's tried every approach... Unbelievable. Unbelievable... Thank you very much. - Here's your receipt. - Oh, thanks. Well then, I'll be going. So? She still really wants to believe. She doesn't want to give up on her childhood dreams. Well, I guess it's not our concern. I mean, even knowing about it, there's nothing that we can do. We've made a decision not to use our abilities on a regular basis. But it's nice. Up until now, I've dealt with all of this alone. But today, I got to meet all of you. It's the first time I've been able to share it with someone else. It was really nice. Is that really it? Yeah. I don't like it. Me either. I feel like we're wasting our potential. Ohh... That's pretty good. Wait a minute. Are we really gonna do this? Yeah, I mean, it would be wrong to just let it end this way. What with us all here together. Let's call it a continuation of our "ESPer" party. Yeah! Sorry. Sorry. I... uh... I'm not really an "ESPer"... Hey... hey... so this, uh, this means I'm not gonna die? - Can we borrow this for a minute? - Oh..sure. - Do this and you can go home. - Huh? How about using this? Oh... yeah. That's good. Is there anything else for me to do? - No, we're good. - Oh, OK, I'll just sit over here. Sakurai. It's OK... There's one more thing we'd like you to see. You have to see this. Please! Here they come! He's back! Tails! Man... 3 right and 2 wrong so far, right? Yeah... alright! Next one will be... Umm, excuse me. I'm really OK. I really don't believe. Sakurai, please look closely. I mean, isn't it a little childish? For a grown-up to believe in supernatural abilities... You don't know what's going to happen until it happens. What could that be? I can hear some kind of bell. A bell? It's kind of an electronic sound. Here we go... on the count of five... It's outside the window. - Let's open it and take a look! - Yeah! - OHHH! - Huh? - Forward. Forward. Forward. - Wait wait wait... whoa... Wasn't that Santa just now? Yeah, he was flying! Sakurai, get your camera! - What a scoop! - You've gotta chase after it! Yeah! Hurry! Hurry! Something up? I guess I'll just never get that kiss. Are you alright? Yeah, I mean, he is the Thin Man. He's much easier than the factory chief! Should that really matter with a psychic ability? Oh no! - Did you drop him? - Yeah... But the pond isn't frozen, so he should be fine, right? It's so cold. So cold... - You guys! - Hey! Welcome back. - How did it go? - Did you get some good footage? Yeah! Alright! I still can't believe he's real. Yeah, to be able to actually see Santa... He didn't have any reindeer with him though. They probably finished delivering presents and went home. - He could even fly just by himself, huh? - Yeah. Well then, take care. You're really gonna surprise your director. It'll be great if it makes it to air. Hey... you guys... by any chance... What is it? Is something up? It's nothing. Thank you very much. To remember you by. It's OK. I won't tell anyone. Hold on tightly to that spoon in your heart. You got it. Well then, I'm off. Goodbye. Goodbye. Why did you say that at the end? - Huh? - That was one of her mental images, wasn't it? If you do things like that, she'll catch on to us. She already knows now, doesn't she? I wonder... What's up? That was the first time I've ever had my telepathy used on me. That was a pretty crazy night. There's cake and champagne everywhere. Speaking of which, both of those were you're fault, weren't they? Here you go. What's that? I went to get it earlier. Why? Somehow I just had the feeling things would turn out this way. - You mean... - A premonition. A premonition!? I'm getting more and more skilled at it. Oh, so you mean, you were serious before? Yeah. But my success rate is still pretty low though. I'm from Yogashi World. I've got that cake you ordered. - Oh, thanks a lot. - My pleasure. I ordered this too. Oh, you're right again. I'm really in tune here. What do you think? Kanda! You came back!? Where am I supposed to go like this? Uh... uh..are you OK? Wha... what happened? Wh..who are you? It..it doesn't matter. You'd better take that off. Reunited with the reindeer... But really, why'd you come back? Come on... You never finished teaching me X-ray vision Well, first, let's get you changed. Oh... thank you. X-ray vision? Ps... psychic powers! "Cafe du Nenriki (psychic powers)" Oh, I get it, that's why it's called Cafe du Nenriki! Am I wrong? No, right? Is that your playroom? A psychic playroom. An X-ray room... Merry Christmas. Thank you for coming. You really came all the way back here to learn? Yeah, Thin Man was no good. I mean at least... I thought maybe I could learn X-ray vision. You must be freezing. I'll have this place warmed up in no time. Is that really gonna be enough? Oh, by the way, about that "ESPer" that helped out Master... What kind of a person was he? Oh... well, a while back in this neighborhood Master was apparently attacked by a stray dog. - And? - Well, then... Just when he had been pinned up against a wall and was completely helpless A sports bag suddenly rolled across right in front of his eyes. A sports bag? Yeah, just rolling across the ground all by itself. And then the dog started chasing after it and Master was saved. Wow... Definitely the work of an "ESPer" Helping out without showing himself. Pretty cool... - The very model of an "ESPer". - Yeah. Completely different from some pervy "ESPer". - Sure is. - Come on, enough already. Sorry to keep you waiting! - All better, huh? - Let's get down to business. No problem. Anytime. X-ray vision is the basis for everything. It all begins and ends with X-ray vision. Quit treating it like a beginner's course. Let's see, what was it? Uh... ummm... Oh... focus your full attention... then start to form an image in your head... Come on, I'm teaching him! Absolutely! Alright, here we go. Square. - Oh, so close! - Just a little further... - Alright! - That was just by chance. Oh, so close, so close... Somewhere out there, a UFO is flying around, Bigfoot is wandering about, Nessy and Kusshi are sleeping at the bottom of a lake, and a bunch of "ESPers" are having a party. The doors are all around us. You just need to choose whether or not to open them. I believe that long ago, an "ESPer" gave the key to open those doors to the children of Japan. And that key has gotten pretty bent out of shape... Miyano! Miyano! Look... What? What? Was there an accident? No, no, look, over there, over there. - Where? Over where? - Up there. Look! - Up? What did you see? Come on, what was it? Where? I can't see anything. What is it? Is something up? Huh? No, no no no. No way... I think we've been brought together by fate. I would really like it if you would be... Hey! Hey! There's a light! Who gives a damn a about Christmas Eve...
