Subtitles by explosiveskull Someone once said, "Life isn't about the number of breaths you took. "It's about the moments that took your breath away." It's a beautiful thought, but what about the moments in between, the moments we don't expect and the little things that don't seem important at first? I'm sorry, what? Oh, nevermind. So, Jeffrey, where do you want to go tomorrow? I don't know, Cass. I have a lot of files to get through and I'll probably be working all weekend. But it's your birthday. I will try and get this done, but, yeah, that sounds good. Yeah, I think that's the best course of action. Hey, you. Hey. Can I call you back? Thank you. You're welcome. So, guess what Roger did. I know, but listen. This is actually really good. He has an in with the director of the Miami City Ballet and he got us both an audition. That's amazing. They're gonna love you. What did mom say? Oh, well, um... You haven't told her, have you? Not yet. Are you serious? We have to call her right now. Wait, hold on. It's so competitive. And you know how she gets. I don't want her to freak out if I don't make it. Hey, Tessa. Hey, Jeffrey. So, what are you gonna do for his birthday? We're gonna go to Rossi's. Oh, that'll be nice. Mm-hmm. Okay, well, you have work to do and I have errands to run, so I'll leave you to it. But I'll cook us dinner later and we can both call mom together. That sounds amazing. Okay, still no answer. I'll just call again in a little while. Just leave a message. Her voicemail's full. Well, mom is a senior citizen, you know? She probably watched Wheel of Fortune and dozed off during Jeopardy!. Okay, I should crash. I have to be at the airport at 6:30. Yeah, I still haven't made Jeffrey's birthday card. What? I just always thought that you would be the one to make it. I was always jealous of how good you are, you know? Yeah, but then reality set in and I had to be responsible. Responsible, okay, but it was like when daddy died, so did your dreams. You just gave up. Uh, you're gonna be brilliant. Miami City Ballet's new prima ballerina. I love you, Cass. I love you too. Thank you. We need a few minutes. Happy birthday. I know it's silly. Since I was little I made birthday cards for people. Cassie... Don't say anything. Just open it. I don't understand. You're the dancer. Well, I thought you, well, we could take classes together. Classes. You could teach them and I would end up looking like an idiot. Oh, come on. It would be fun. It would be like a couple's thing. Yeah. You know they don't condone workplace relationships. We both could lose our jobs and you just got promoted. Not if we're smart and discreet about it. What are you trying to say? Maybe we should stop seeing each other before this gets more serious. Maybe? We can still be friends, you know? Friends, wow. I don't wanna lost my job. You are really something. I'm gonna go. Hello? Hey, I just got a call from the hospital and mom had a heart attack. What? Oh my gosh, is she... She is stable. Okay, so I hope to get there. Okay, good. Okay, and don't worry. She seems fine at this point. Okay, what time is your flight? It's gonna be at 8:30 tonight. I'll be there as soon as I can. What's the latest? The doctor said that the first few days are the most critical. They need to monitor her. Well, look what the cat dragged in. Oh, mom. Now that both my beautiful girls are here, I'm gonna be just fine. And in order to be just fine, she needs plenty of rest. We'll be quick. You got it. You get some sleep. We love you. I love you too. Stop. Hey, are either one of you Ms. Daniels? Yes. Okay, so I have... Sam, is that you? Hey, Marsha, I... What are you doing here? I'm just giving... Where are my manners? Hey, ya'll. I'm Marsha. I moved in just down the street last year and I look in on your momma every now and again. You're Cassie and you're Tessa. Am I right? Of course I am. I could recognize you to in a church hall on free catfish night. So, I have... Oh, don't be silly. I've got plenty. Come on. So, I'm here to give... Don't be silly. Join us. Oh my, I hope you aren't vegetarians, are you? Or one of them veganites. Well, I actually do try... Absolutely not. I'm a vegetarian. Since when? Well, whatever floats that little boat of yours. I guess you'll miss out on this tasty meat sauce then. So, how's your momma doing? She's resting comfortably. Oh, that's fantastic news. I tried to visit her, but she was in the ICU and they said only immediate family was allowed and as much as I feel like I family, I certainly wasn't gonna try to pull a fast one. Although, if I kept flirting with that male nurse, I might've gotten in to see her. Look at me, inviting myself in and rambling on. I'm sure ya'll have plenty to do without silly old me making a fuss. Okay, so I'm actually here to serve a notice on foreclosure proceedings on the dance studio. It's my first, so I'm like a little nervous, but sorry, but Marsha, thank you for this carrot. It's wonderful. Goodbye. I'm gonna go out this way. All right. Ain't that a buzzkill? Okay, well, it certainly was nice meeting you two. Please give my best to your mother. I know she'll be back on her feet in no time. Sorry about the bad news. Toodles. Wow. One, two, three, four, left side, turn. Tess, I'm not gonna let you miss this opportunity. Mom would be so disappointed. There will be other auditions. Can I help you? Roxy. Ah. Hi, Roxy. Hi. Been doing my best to hold down the fort in your momma's absence. I trust she's doing well. Oh, yeah. She's still her stubborn self. Oh, this is one of our new little ballerinas, Emily and her mother Linda Rogers. Hi. Hi. This is Miss Cassie and Miss Tessa. Miss Kate's daughters. Miss Kate is the best dance teacher ever. I sure hope she gets better real soon. Aw, thank you, Emily. It's so nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. You know, when Dean and I heard about what happened, we were just sick. If there's anything we can do, please let us know. Oh, thank you. That's very kind. Excuse me, duty calls. Sure. Rogers, of course. Um, Dean is a very lucky man. We went to school together. Oh, no. I'm Dean's sister. I was two years ahead of you in school. Oh, yeah. I remember. You were a... Chubby, pimple-faced, bookworm? Well, you look great. Thank you. Emily is Dean's niece. So, how is Dean? Dean is a hard dog to keep under the porch, to say the least. Emily, let's get going. But I like it here. We have somewhere to be. It's so nice to see you all. Bye. Goodbye. Roxy, we know the studio is having problems. You could say that. Look, your momma is an amazing woman and I know she's doing the best she can, but she was never interested in making any changes to keep the studio afloat. I'll show you the books whenever you're ready. Okay, thank you. Thanks. I could use some air. Me too. Hola, Cassandra and Theresa. Hola, Victor. You get more beautiful each time I see you. And you, my dear, we could dance the night away. Oh, please give your mom my very best. But now, I must prepare to teach tonight's advanced ballroom. Hasta luego, mi amigas. Adios, Victor. What would this place be like without him? I know. Hey. Hey. Thank you. You're welcome. I can't believe she didn't tell us. I mean, from what it looks like, the mortgage hasn't been paid in over six months. Wow. Okay, what are we gonna do? Nothing we can do at this hour. You sure had it bad for Dean Rogers. Remember? Hey. Hey, Cassie, what's up? Well, I haven't seen you at the studio the past couple of weeks and we don't have any classes... I'm not going back. I'm quitting dance. But you're so good. You love it. My mom made me go. She's not making me anymore. Well, happy birthday, Dean. Hey, Amber. You're a day late, a dollar short, and way out of your league, little miss. Let's go. I can't believe I never told you that before. I knew. I saw the whole thing. I went back to get the card out of the trash can, but it was gone. You're amazing, you know that? Thank you. Good morning. Hi, mom. Hey, mom. How are you feeling? Ah, fair to middlin'. Ladies, please keep it short and sweet. Of course. Thank you. So, the doctor says my blood pressure's still a little bit too high, but my heart seems to be doing pretty good. That's good news, yeah? I'm still kickin', ain't I? Yes, you are. And Tessa has some good news. It's not a big deal. If you don't tell her, I will. Tessa, don't make me get out of this bed and give you a piece of my mind. Okay. I got an audition for the Miami City Ballet. That's fantastic. You're gonna be amazing. I'm so proud. No, I'm actually, I'm not gonna go. I'm gonna stay with you. What? The doctors here are gonna fix me up like new. I'm gonna be back to that studio in no time. No, mom, please. It's really not a big deal. It's settled then. You are going to the audition. You two need to skedaddle outta here. Go. There's no use arguing, Tess. Love you. Love you, mom. Think of what it will mean for the studio when you get accepted to the Miami City Ballet. People will be lining the streets to study where Tessa Daniels used to dance. Well, when you put it that way... Yeah, I didn't like hip hop at first either, but it kinda grows on you. I'll take Merle Haggard any day. Five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Up, hit, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, whoo! Good job, everyone. Much much better, Billy. We're teaching hip hop? Yes. Interesting. Just trying to bring this place into new millennia, that's all. I don't know how my mom would feel about that, but if it's bringing customers in, I guess it could only help. Cassie? Oh, hi, Dean. Hey. I didn't expect to see you here. It's so great to see you. Uh, yeah. Have you met my niece, Emily? Yes, hi, Emily. It's nice to see you again. Hi, Miss Cassie. Are you and Uncle Dean friends? Yes, we... - We used to be. - Are. Okay, I have to get ready for class. Bye. Bye. Hey, how's your mom doing? Resting comfortably. That's good to hear. And Tessa, how's Tessa? Just missed her. Oh. She's auditioning for the Miami City Ballet. That's great. Yeah. So, um, how long are you gonna be in town for? Just long enough for mom to get back on her feet and figure out what's going on with the studio. Everything okay? Nothing I can't handle. Well, look, tiny dancer, it's great to see you again. It's good to see you too, but please don't call me that anymore. Come on. You used to love it when I called you that. Yeah, I grew up. I'll be right with you. Hey, um, give me a call. Let's catch up. Yeah. Bye. So, what are our options? My dad's estate, his life insurance? She used that for renovations to the studio and with the second mortgage, there's nothing left. The studio's been in trouble for a long time now. I know how much it means to her and I'm gonna do my best to keep it quiet, but it's eventually gonna get out. It's appreciated. It's a lot to process. Let's chat again when you have a moment and I will do my best to help in any way I can. Thank you. Thank you for the coffee. Take care. Thank you, Mr. William. Can we take out a loan or a second mortgage or something? I don't think so. I certainly won't qualify. Me neither. Hey, why don't you dance? Don't talk on the phone. Seriously, you text 24/7. I'll be done in a minute. Whatever. So, what's next? Well, Mr. William gave us a little more time to find a solution. I don't know if that means finding a buyer or what, but just the idea of closing the studio after all the work mom and dad put into it just seems wrong. Mom will be devastated. I know it's silly to ask you not to worry about this, but try not to, okay? How's audition prep going? Go figure. We rush out here and then they push it back a week, but I think we'll be ready. Well, you're gonna be great. Remember, I'm counting on you to make it, so we can parlay your fame into success for the studio. So, no pressure then, right? None at all. Okay, I'll talk to you later. Miss Roxy knows how much I absolutely love working here and I've tried to be optimistic, but we've had to go without paychecks several times in this past year. I got an offer from On Your Toes in Bella Springs and I assure you I wasn't looking, but I can't pass up this opportunity. Well, I mean, as much as we hate to see you go, I completely understand. I really do wish you guys the very best. I hope to see you and your mom very soon. Yeah. Take care. You too. Ciao. I'm certainly not teaching that class. But I'm happy to accompany you. Then I guess I am. Hello. For those of you who don't know me, my name is Miss Cassie. You're Miss Kate's daughter. I remember you. You and that good-looking young man were always dancing together. What was his name? It's Dean. Um, so, I'll be teaching your class today. Where's Mr. Victor? He moved on to greener pastures. He died? Oh, no no no. He got another job. I'm sorry. We wish him well and until we can find a replacement, you're gonna be stuck with me. We were learning the Cha Cha. Oh, perfect. The Cha Cha is lively, flirtatious, and full of passionate energy. Okay, then I'm gonna need a partner. Can I have a volunteer? I'd be happy to help you. Thank you, sir, but it really should be one of the students. Sir? Yeah, I just, you know, I meant that, it didn't seem like you had any... My bad, carry on. Oscar, Oscar, get up there and dance with Miss Cassie. Awesome. Okay, so, the Cha Cha requires small steps and a lot of hip movement. It's in four-four time and the third and the fourth beat are split into three. One, two, cha cha cha. Okay, so, to start, the male partner's gonna step forward on his right foot and his partner's gonna step back with her left and then we're gonna come back to the center and then cha cha cha in place. Ah, my toe. Come on. It's okay. When we have the music, you'll feel it. It'll be fine. Sorry, Missy, but in my 80 years, there's one thing I've learned. I'm a student, not a teacher. Ease it on up here. Little ol' me? Mm-hmm. Okay, come on, Emily. Let's help Miss Cassie out. Perfect. Okay. Five, six, seven, eight. Um, anyway, I'm a little rusty myself, but you guys get the idea. If that's rusty, I'm decomposed. All right, everybody grab your partner and let's try it. Hey, you. Hey, I just thought I'd swing by and you know, see if I could ask you to dinner. Um, you know, I actually don't know if that is an option because I kind have this other other thing. Yeah, you can't come up with a good excuse? Pretty much. Eight o'clock. Uh, but it's not a date. It's just two people, who've known each other since middle school, having dinner. Not a date. So, I'll pick you up. No, I'll meet you there. Where are we going? What sounds good to you? The Clubhouse, seven p.m., not a date. So, how is life in the big city? You seeing anybody? Wow, you cut to the chase. Um, but to answer your question, yes. Okay. That's cool. I'm happy for you. What about you? Dated around a little bit, but, no, truth is, I'm just too busy for anything serious right now. Decided it's important to be there for Linda and Emily. At least until Linda gets back on her feet. She was pretty devastated after her husband left. Oh, well, they're really lucky to have you. I think I'm pretty lucky too. Is that why you never left Georgetown? I'm sorry. It's just, it's all you used to talk about. I did leave. For a little while I was working down in Savannah. This young slick developer. Really? Well, I thought I was. Truth is, I was in way over my head. Too arrogant to realize it. I ended up filing for bankruptcy when I was 22. And then after Linda's husband left, it seemed like a good time for me to come back and be there for her and get back on my feet. You seem to be doing very well now. It took a few years, but I think I'm finally on the right path. Besides, Georgetown's where I'm meant to be. And I get to be my own boss and take off for the important things, like ballet and Cha Cha lessons. To friends. Friends. Here you go. Whenever you're ready. Thank you. You wanna go for a walk? I think we should pay the bill first. Yeah, probably. Oh, I haven't dined and dashed since, since that time at Gator's Strike. Do you remember that? Oh my gosh, I can't believe you brought that up. Oh, we'll split it. Oh, no no no no. Fine, but this is not a date. Not a date, got it. Of course not. You have a boyfriend. This is supposed to be a very good wine. Look at how beautiful it can be here at night. Yeah. Ah, so, I have to be honest. I had a boyfriend until a few days ago. I see. Yeah, this guy names Jeffrey. I don't know what I saw in him. He dumped me on his birthday. Wow. Mm-hmm. I guess that's better than being dumped on your birthday. This is true. So, what's your plan? In life? Yeah, I guess, but I meant, you know, not so distant future, here, now. Oh, right. Well, mom should be getting released from the hospital soon and then, well, the studio's not doing so well financially. I'm sorry. Yeah, please keep that to yourself. Yeah, of course. You know, maybe it's time we started thinking outside the box on that. Well, we're gonna have to think of something quick or Coastal Dance Center will be a thing of the past. We can't have that. We? That place, it means the world to Emily. And it means a lot to me too. As they say, we're all in this together, right? Don't you miss it? Miss what? Dance. That was then. I have a career now. Listen, there's something I've been meaning to apologize to you for. Ah, there's no need to apologize. Thank you for a wonderful dinner and non-date. Goodnight. Cassie? Walter Carlos Gaviote, my favorite student. Cassie, it's been forever. How's Miss Kate? She's doing well, thank you. That's great. So, how have you been? Last time I saw you you had braces. Good. I've been applying to a bunch of different colleges and, but, listen, Victor told me he was leaving and I wanna help. I might could cover some of his ballroom classes? That's so sweet, but business hasn't been so great. You need a ballroom instructor, right? Well, yeah. Look, my parents got me covered. I'll teach a couple classes and when things get better, we'll talk, cool? Thank you. It's so good to see you. You hired Walter? Is that a problem? He's like 12 years old. How do you intend to pay him? We worked it out. Look, this kid you have so much faith in, represents what's wrong with the studio. He may be young, but he's old-school. All he knows is traditional dance. We need fresh blood. I thought that was why you were here. Listen, Walter can teach old-school ballet and you can teach contemporary and get your hip hop on. Roxy, it's the best of both worlds. Where did all these people come from? I posted on Instagram and Snapchat that I was gonna be teaching and if you excuse me, I have some work to do. See you next week. Thank you. This is impressive. Well, that should help out with some of the bills, yeah? It's a start. Do you have a second? Yeah. Have you heard of the new Southern Regionals? It's held each May and there's like 10,000 in prizes. That would make the bank happy, but that's like a month away. So? Who would represent the studio? Oh, no. I haven't danced at that level in years. Come on, dude. How many titles do you have? I don't know. And who would I partner with? Besides, none of the other studios are as good as us and when we win, people will be lining up to take lessons with us. Victor will probably be there. Counting on it. And step left, step right, and jump. Jump, and oh, ow. Ooh. Oooh. Are you okay, Uncle Dean? Yeah, I'm okay. Just fine, sweetheart. What is all this? It's father-daughter or uncle dance appreciation day. How cute is that? Nice tutu. Pink would not have been my first choice. I think you're more of a winter palette. I don't know. Pretty fond of pink, thank you very much. You sure you're okay? Yeah, just my ego. Well, in that case, I have to go rehearse. Oh, yeah? It's a secret. Hmmm. I don't think she should be keeping secrets from us. We can keep a secret, can't we? Yeah. Yeah, I think so. Especially a big juicy secret. Hi. I brought contraband. Oh, yay. I hope you're hungry. Oh, I am. What'd you bring me? It's a surprise. Here you go. Mmm mmm. Looky here, looky here. Oh. That looks good. Come on, let's dig in. How are we doing today? Ah, much better now. Would you like some pulled pork? I'm a vegan. Oh, we've got corn. Come on, dig in. Tango? Tango. Tango? Is there an echo? It's all about connecting with the music, connecting with the audience. Drama, passion, synchronicity. I'm impressed. Our moves are stealth like a cat, poised and confident. Let's try it. Five, six, seven, eight. And... Oh, sorry. Hello? Oh, yeah, I'll be right there. Thank you. Um, I gotta go, I'm sorry. Oh, is everything okay? Yeah, my mom's being released from the hospital. Nice. - Okay. - Yeah, I'll see you later. Bye. Now, she needs plenty of rest. The nurse will give you instructions as well as modifications for her diet, okay? Okay. So, the most important thing is she needs to take it easy. Her body still needs to heal. That'll be tough. She doesn't really like others taking care of her. I'm sure she'll enjoy a little TLC. We'll see about that. We'll see about what? Oh, hey, mom. Are you ready to go home? Indeed, I am. Chop chop. Yes, ma'am. Miss Kate, you take care of yourself. Thank you, doc. Let's get moving. Let's get home. Shouldn't you be home with your momma? She kicked me out. Doesn't surprise me. I'll be sure to go by and see her later, if that's okay. Thank you. That would be so sweet. Oh, can I get you something? It's on me. Um, maybe just some soup. Coming right up. Thank you. Hey, it's me. Call me when you get this. Cassie? Uh, hi, yes. I'm Amber. Remember? You're a day late, a dollar short, and way out of your league, little miss. Oh, Amber. Of course. How are you? I'm good. I'm just meeting a friend for dinner. So, what brings you to town? Um, I'm just visiting my mom. That's great. Yeah, you look really good. Thank you. Oh, so do you. Thank you. Here you go. Oh, thank you. Oh, hey, Amber. Can I get you something? Oh, no. I'm good for now, thanks. Okay. So, I heard you and Dean had dinner. Yes, we did. Well, that's nice. It sure is good to catch up. You know, I'm very proud of him for bouncing back like he did. And between you and me, he should've never left town. But he's back now. That's all that matters. So, are you and he... Oh, hey, there she is. I gotta run, but it was so good to see you. You too. Hey, you two. I gotta lock up for the night. Okay, Miss Kate. Thank you. Be right out. Okay. More coffee? I'm sorry, what? More coffee, honey? Oh, yes. Thank you. Much better. Same time tomorrow? Sounds good. Very nice moves. Thanks. How can I help you? May I have a moment of your time? Hadley Prescott. And you must be Miss Kate's daughter. I'm Cassie, yes. I've met with your mother on several occasions in the past. I've also been told that she had a recent health scare. I hope she's en route to a speedy recovery. Thank you. Continue. Now, I'm also aware of the challenges that the studio has been facing. I discussed buying the building from your mother. And I'm sure she wanted to hear nothing about it. Yeah, that pretty much sums it up. So, what would you be planning to do with the building if you buy it? I can't say specifically, but my associates and I, we have a gameplan for these parts. And would you consider leasing it back to us? Out of the question. But we are willing to pay off your mortgage default so you all can move on and be debt free. It's a win-win. Win-win. So, you're telling me that this studio, this piece of the community that's been in my family since before I was born, is only worth its outstanding mortgage? Now, I wouldn't put it exactly that way. Well, however you wanna spin it, Mr. Prescott. Please, call me Hadley. Actually, I don't think I'll be calling you at all. Please see yourself out. Whoa, this is so awesome! Hey, guys, take a picture of me for my Instagram. Hips in. Hold your, hold your arms up and stay. Chest open, lifted up. Good, all right. Let's try it again. Hey, Cassie. - How are you? - Hi, good. How are you? Good. How's your mom? She's recovering. You know how stubborn she is. Yes, I know how your mom is. But now I have to deal with Roxy. Yeah, Roxy can be bossy sometimes, but she's been really great to step in while my mom's been out, and you guys have to. I know it's been tough around here. You know, you and your mom are so good to me and the kids, so don't worry about it. Thank you. You guys have been amazing. So, I heard you're going to the dance competition? Yeah, scary, huh? So, you need any help? Yeah, I could use all the help I could get. Any time. You guys get back to work. All right. - Bye. - Bye. All right, try it again. Dad, I really wish you were here to tell me what to do. I know how much the studio meant to you and still does to mom. I'm doing my best, but I don't think it's gonna be enough. I know you always told me that tough times don't last if people do. This is one tough time. I miss you so much. More coffee? Yes, please, thank you. Hey. Hi. Here you go. I got a feeling. Oh yeah. I don't trust that young one with the curly hair. He's up to no good if you ask me. I hear ya. Well, have a nice day. All right, you too, honey. Thank you. Hey, can I talk to you for a second? Yeah. Be right back. Hey, what's going on? So, I had a chance to catch up with Amber the other day. Okay. Is there something you wanna tell me? Listen, if you two are still dating, that's your thing. I just know why you didn't tell me. What else are you not telling me? Not telling you? Look, I have been completely honest with you. You know what? I don't owe you an explanation about that. You're the one who left Georgetown and never came back and pretty soon, you're gonna leave again and none of this ever mattered. Cassie, wait. I didn't... What was that all about? I just, I wanna focus on the competition and getting my mom back on her feet. What happened? Skydiving incident. Skydiving. Oh, it was great. We had a blast until I tripped and fell in the parking lot on the way home. There's no way we'll be ready in time. Oh no. I'm really sorry. It's fine. What are we gonna do? We're gonna have to pull out of the competition. Let me coach you. You've been doing really good and I'm sure we could find you another partner. How are we gonna find a new partner in two weeks? All you had to do was ask. Absolutely not. Cassie, I'm sorry. If you just let me... Listen. You broke my trust. I don't want your apology. Please, listen to me for one second, okay? I can't deal with this right now. Cassie. I have too many things to worry about. All I ever wanted to do was help, just give back to the studio. Don't. Sometimes we have to put the past behind us, let it go. This is just a job to you. And when this is gone, you can find another one. You're wrong. This is so much more than a job. Dance is what I love. I love this place. Everyone deserves a second chance. Look, we may not see eye to eye, but I only know one thing. You are a talented dancer. And I also know you're quite fond of someone, just by how you keep telling yourself otherwise. I don't know what you're talking about. You don't? You stay out of this. Now, it's your turn to shine, do some good for the studio. I'm happy to work with you and Walter if you'll have me, help you get ready for the competition. Are you sure about that? On one condition. Oh, here it comes. Please kiss and make up with Dean. I concur. You two are incorrigible. It's settled then. I didn't say that. Come, Walter, we have to strategize. Oooh. Hi. Hi. Shall we? Dance? Let's go. What are you two doing here? Oh, uh, we just wanted to check in and see how you were doing. Good morning. Afternoon. Hey, Miss Kate. Hello, Dean. Dean and I are gonna be competing in the Souther Regionals. Then what are you doing here? Ya'll need to rehearse. Now get. Mom. I ain't dead yet. I'm fine. Just need to take it easy. Now, outta here. I can stay for a little while. They're covering for me at the restaurant. Thank you, Marsha. You all worry too much. I don't need a babysitter, just some sleep. Everyone out. Go. I love you. I love you too. Take care, Miss Kate. So long, Dean. For the record, Amber and I, we did date for a while after high school. We even did the long-distance thing when I was in Savannah. But then my business fell apart, she started ignoring me. Wouldn't even take my call. Now that I'm finally back on my feet, guess I'm worthy. And? Do you have any idea how much you hurt me? I mean, I know it was high school but it still hurts. We were great together and then you chose the bottled-blonde hotty to impress your friends. I really cared about you. I know you did and I can't tell you how many times I wanted to pick up the phone and call you. Why didn't you? I was a teenage boy with a fragile ego. Why did you really leave Georgetown? To start my career. Cassie, you are the best dancer I've ever known and you went off and you got a corporate nine to five. I get it, it's safe, but there's no risk there. There's no reward either. I got promoted. We can only lie to ourselves for so long. Wouldn't you rather try and fail than never try at all? Your timing is impeccable. I put this off for as long as I could, but the board is breathing down my neck. The board or a vulture, wanting to swoop in when we're at our most vulnerable? You know if the bank moves in, it'll be far worse for you than if you accept our generous offer. Paying off our mortgage and leaving us with nothing is far from generous. It'll save you all the humiliation of foreclosure. And knowing we acquired your property for even less than we're offering now. You might wanna work on your bedside manner, my friend. Duly noted. Cassie, I would stop this if I could, but I've put this off for far too long. My dance partner, Dean, and I are gonna be competing in the Southern Regionals. It's $10,000 for the winner. And all of that would go to the studio and the business has actually been getting... Yeah, but that's if you win. I have the utmost faith in you ability, but that is hardly something I can take back to the board. The $10,000 will merely delay the foreclosure. You'll need to show some substantial business growth for the bank to reconsider. Is he giving you a hefty commission? Come on now. Well is he? Cassie. Looks, it's true. I want the property, but I haven't exerted any pressure or offered any incentives to Mr. William. Why don't I believe either of you? I have to take this call. Excuse me. If you're not even willing to consider Mr. Hadley's... I said I have to take this. Let's go. More bad news? When it rains. Hi, Tessa. Hi. Hey. Hi. I made it. The director of the Miami City Ballet loved me. I'm so proud of you. Thank you, but Roger didn't make it and then he broke up with me. Oh, I'm sorry. Milkshake? Always makes my niece feel better. My treat. Got lots to talk about. Yeah, that sounds great. Let's go. Come on. Stop. What's wrong? You're not feeling it. Not feeling what? The passion, the intensity. You guys have the choreography. Just make it come to life. Let's try it again. five, six, seven, eight. Come on, guys. Feed off each other. Come on. Stop stop stop stop stop. Hey, guys. I actually do have a couple of really great exercises that might help, if you wanna give them a try. But I don't wanna step on any toes. Why don't we just take a break? No no no. Let's do this. Okay. Step closer together. Closer. Now gaze into each other's eyes. Whoever laughs first has to buy me another milkshake. And five, six, seven, eight. Hello? Where are you? I'm sorry. I'm sorry that I hurt you. I'm sorry I wasn't smart enough to realize we had a good thing. And I'm sorry it took me over 10 years to finally tell you that. Shall we? Dance. Hola. Uh, hi. Looking good. We have some work to do. Whatever you say, hotshot. You're on, old man. Nice job, just make sure you keep the arms up, okay? And shoulders back, always shoulders back and chest up, okay? What are you, 12? 19, almost. Keep up the good work, guys. All right, let's do this hotshot. All right, old man. Five, six, seven, eight. Okay. You do your thing. I got it, okay? What's she doing here? This should be interesting. Hi. Yes, Charlotte, please. Sorry to bother you, but our dressing room is locked. Hold on, hold on, hold on. Just give me a minute, okay? Can I just borrow your keys? I'll bring them right back. Charlotte, I can't. Hold on just a sec, please please please. Here, its... I know which one it is. All right, bring 'em right back, okay? Okay, go ahead. Good luck, Uncle Dean. Good luck, Miss Cassie. Thank you. I just know you're going to win. Well, you know, you're supposed to say break a leg. Why would I say that? Do you know what a superstition is? I think so. Well, you say break a leg because it's exactly what you don't want to happen. I think you're playing a trick on me. No, that's honey. That's what you're supposed to say. Okay, well, break a leg, Uncle Dean. Break a leg, Miss Cassie. All right, now, let's let these two finish getting ready. Bye. Bye. What's wrong? Um. Oh. Yeah, okay, I'll be right back. Uh, could we use a paper clip? Oh yeah, that would look great. You just happened to have these in your purse. Dancer's always prepared. I wish my mom could be here. I know she is in spirit. Thank you. Hi. Oh my gosh. Oh, hey. I'm so sorry. Are you ready? Welcome to the fifth annual Southern Regional Amateur Dance Competition. We'd like to thank our sponsors for their generous support. And, of course, our judges. Tonight's competition will be judged on originality, precision, choregraphic execution, and And to all our competitors, break a leg. Not half bad. Pretty slick if you ask me. Amber? Money talks. Hey, you. Hey, I didn't know you danced. While you were crashing and burning in Savannah, I learned some fancy moves. Thought it would impress you. Hey, I hate to ask, but do you have any safety pins? I might have some in my dressing room? Do you mind? I'll catch you out there. Great, thanks. She any good? Money talks. I have to say I'm surprised to see you here. Oh, I know. Wait, I can't open the door. Hey. It seems to be locked. I'll go get some help. Oh, there you are. Thank you so much. Yeah, thanks. Hello? Is anybody there? Oh. Oh no. Ouch. Where's your partner? She'll be right back. We're ready. We're looking for Cassie and Dean. They're next. Is the couple ready? Should I go backstage? Where's Cassie and Dean? I was just with them. Where did they go? The judges will have to disqualify you if she isn't here soon. I understand. Just give me one minute, one minute. Okay. Have you seen Cassie? I think she's in the restroom. Okay. Hello? Shall we? Dance. Did Amber lock you in there? How'd you get out? We will have to disqualify the if they are a no-show. Looks like they just made. And here is Cassie and Dean. They made it. All right. Cassie. Whoo, yay! Whoo! How do you feel? Amazing. Me too. I can't believe Amber did that. Actually, I can. I went back later and grabbed it. It's been in my sock drawer ever since. I can't believe you kept it. Places. Yeah. Welcome our finalists. And in third place, with a $500 cash prize Expressions. Whoo! The runner up with a $2,000 cash prize is Twilight Dance Factory. The winner of the Southern Regional Amateur Dance Competition and a $10,000 cash prize is A Second Chance. Whoo! Whoo, Cassie! Whoo. Whoo. Yes. Whoo! Next time. You guys were amazing. I'll see you outside. Thank you. Congratulations. Thank you. Thank you. Oh, I'm so proud of you. Nice job, old man. Yeah, thanks hotshot. Oh, congratulations. Hey, excuse me, guys. There's someone here to see you. Mom? You two were simply gorgeous up there. You saw the whole thing? Snuck in at the last minute, got a seat in the back. Please tell me you did not convince her to sell. I have to say that was truly beautiful to watch. I have never... I'm glad you enjoyed it, but I wanna know why you're here. To answer your question, yes, I convinced her to sell. Mom, no. We won. We could at least... Let the man speak. Let's just say my new investment partner is very passionate about dance. We're paying off your mortgage, plus 20%, which you can use for renovations how ya'll see fit and go ahead and spend those winnings however you want. I don't understand. We'll then lease the studio back to you for $1 a month for five years. And once you get back on your feet, we'll negotiate in good faith. Sounds like a win-win to me. Excuse me one second. Thank you. Thank you, Hadley. We all just gonna stand around here or we gonna go celebrate? Mom, you just got out of the hospital. I'll take it easy. I reserved the banquet room at Deck 383, my treat. Shall we? We'll meet you guys there. Just gotta pack up and change. So, is this it, tiny dancer? Well, we're gonna join everyone for dinner, right? You know what I mean. Uh, actually, I'm gonna stay and help my mom with the studio. What about that job of yours? It's just a job. Dance is what I love, my family. This is my home. I see. What's going on with you? Nothing. It's all good. You know, we should get going. You're the mystery investment partner who's passionate about dance, aren't you? Yeah. You know, I guess that means that, technically, I'm your boss. We'll see about that. Subtitles by explosiveskull
