I want to share this wilderness of failure. The others have built you a highway, fast lanes in both directions. I offer you a journey without direction, uncertainty and no sweet conclusion. When the light faded, I went in search of myself. There were many paths and many destinations. (Man 1) That's all right. [ think that's a brilliant rehearsal.

(Babbling) (Woman screams) (Screaming continues) That's it! Great! (Church bell ringing) (Narrator) Soon afterwards, some men who studied the stars came from the east to Jerusalem and asked, "Where is the baby born to be King of the Jews? "We saw his star when it came up in the east, "and we have come to worship him." When King Herod head about this, he was very upset, and so was everyone else in Jerusalem. He called together all the chief priests and the teachers of the law and asked them, "Where will the Messiah be born?" "In the town of Bethlehem, in Judea," they answered, "for this is what the prophet wrote: "Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, "'you are by no means the least of the leading cities of Judah, "for from you will come a leader who will guide my people Israel." (Church bell ringing) (♪ Children singing ♪) (Narrator) And so they left, and on their way, they saw the same star they had seen in the east. When they saw it, how happy they were, what joy was theirs! It went ahead of them until it stopped over the place where the child was. Then they went into the house, and when they saw the child with his mother, Mary, they knelt down and worshipped him. They brought out their gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh, and presented them to him. Then they returned to their country by another road, since God had warned them in a dream not to go back to Herod. When Herod realised that the visitors from the east had tricked him, he was furious. He gave orders to kill all the boys in Bethlehem and in its neighbourhood who were two years old and younger. This was done in accordance with what he had learned from the visitors about the time when the star had appeared.

Men burrowed deep to hide their shameful poisons. For a million years, 30,000 unborn generations bound to the memory of criminal rulers the Secretaries of Energy, who oiled the wheels of mortgage with dead hands.

Old age came quickly for my frosted generation. Cold, cold, cold. They died so silently. Did the forgotten generations scream or go full of resignation, quietly protesting innocence? Cold, cold, cold. They died so silently. I have no words. My shaking hands cannot express my fury. Sadness is all I have. No words. Cold, cold, cold. You died so silently. Linked hands at 4:00am, deep under the city you slept on, never heard the sweet flesh song. Cold, cold, cold. They died so silently. Matthew fucked Mark, fucked Luke, fucked John, who lay on the bed that I lie on. Touch fingers again as you sing this song. Cold, cold, cold. We die so silently. My gilly flower, roses, violets blue, sweet garden of vanished pleasures, please come back next year. Cold, cold, cold. I die so silently. Goodnight, boys. Goodnight, Johnny. Goodnight. Goodnight.
