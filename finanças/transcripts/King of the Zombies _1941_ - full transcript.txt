[rhythmic jungle drums] [music playing] [propellers buzzing] Hello. McCarthy calling. McCarthy calling. Hello? Any luck, Mac? Nah, I can't even scare up a news broadcast. Where do you think we are? Search me. We lost the beam hours ago. Probably somewhere between Cuba and Puerto Rico. Is it that bad? It ain't good. Uh-oh. I knowed I wudn't cut out to be no black bird. If you had those weather gadgets of yours set up, we wouldn't have gotten into this mess. Ah, if that new Navy base gets a weather bureau now, it'll be a miracle. Uh, Mr. Bill. Ain't this the spot where Admiral Wainwright's plane turned up missing last week? Yeah. Uh-oh, look out Admiral. Here we come. Try to contact 'em again, Mac. Hello. McCarthy calling. Plane C-108 calling. Why don't somebody answer? We're lost, do ya hear? Lost! Not a murmur. How's the gas holding out? That's something else again. Well, there are plenty of small islands down here. Better go down and find a spot for landing. That's what I'll-- [radio transmission starting] Wait a minute. There's something coming in. [radio transmission in german] That's a new lingo to me. I don't understand it. Think we're near a radio station? Well the way it's coming in, we must be right over their transmitter. Well that's a break. Well I'm going down and take a look. Hold on, boys. [propellers buzzing] There's a clearing ahead, I think I can make it. Think, did you say think? [propellers buzzing] [rumbling] [crunching] [ka-boom] [music playing] Rest in peace. If that means what I think it means, they sure don't waste no time around here. Wait a minute! Wait a minute! They can do this yet to me. Lemme outta here! Lemme outta here! Lemme outta here! Now lemme outta here! -Hey, hey. What's the matter with you? Good gracious. Is that you, Mr. Bill? Did they have you in a hole too? What are you talking about? What do you mean, have me in a hole? Ain't we dead? Of course we're not dead. I thought I was a little off-color to be a ghost. Oh, there's no such thing as ghosts, Jeff. There ain't? Well what's that, then? That's no ghost, come on. I cain't. My foot done took to root. What are you trying to do, scare us to death? Hey, you're hurt. I'm all right. Just a crack on the noggin. Where are we? Search me. It looks like somebody's marble orchard. Graveyard? That's a fine spot for a crack up. Well, let's look around. Somebody must live around here. Come on. [pounding of jungle drums] Quiet, will ya. Whatcha trying to do, wake up the dead? What's the matter? Did you hear something? No, sir. Just my heart trying to jump outta my chest. That's drums. Drums? That's my cue for me to start parading outta here. [pounding of jungle drums] Look. That's a creepy-looking place. Sure dark. Suppose anybody lives in there? In that hainted house? If they do, they sleep on slabs. Let's find out. Not me. Y'all going in there. I ain't going in that mausoleum. I'm gonna stay right here until I change my mind. A wait a minute. I done changed my mind. [pounding of jungle drums] [steps creaking] Ring the bell, Jeff. Oh, Mr. Bill. You the one wants to go in there. You ring the bell. [doorbell ringing] Sound like a ice cream man. Hmm, there's nobody here. Who's that? [music playing] Welcome to my humble home. Thank you. We were just-- I know. You're plane crashed in the jungle. Well, yes. How did you know? Very little happens on this island that I do not know about. Momba, we have guests. Prepare the library. Have these gentlemen's bags brought in. Well, excuse me, gentlemen. May I introduce myself. I'm Doctor Mikhail Sangre, late of Vienna. Follow me, gentlemen. Mr. Bill, let's get outta here. Oh don't be silly, Jeff. Go on. Oh that man ain't no doctor. It's something wrong here. Well that's Svengali. Ah. You must forgive us, please, if we seem unprepared. Visitors are rare in this house. I'm afraid we're the ones to apologize, doctor, for walking in on you like this. -Not at all. It's a pleasure, I can assure you. I'm Bill Summers. This is Mr. McCarthy. Glad to know you, Doc. My valet, Jefferson. Uh, Jefferson Jackson is my name. You see, I was named after my grandpappy. He was the president of the Knights of the Pink Garters. Ah, you have been hurt. Ah, it's nothing. Just a crack on the head. Nothing you say. The slightest injury on this island often proves fatal. Whaddya mean? The climate and yet. Yet, what? They say that evil spirits lurk here, waiting to prey on the injured. Ha! That's a lot of bunk. Maybe. How about a spot of brandy to warm you up? Fine. Momba. [non-english speech] My servant intrigues you? Is that one of those spirits that you was talking about? Momba, no. It's true he reflects the mood of this house, but he's not as sinister as he looks. Gentlemen, the finest brandy in all Europe. I brought it here myself. To your arrival. The most fortunate accident for me. I'm afraid our arrival was no accident. You mean to say you came here purposely? No, not in the sense you mean. You see, we were on our way to the Bahamas when the storm blew us off our course. We heard your broadcast, so here we are. Broadcast? Mm-hmm. You must be mistaken. There was no broadcast from this island. Your ears must have played you tricks. There is no radio within miles of here. However, well, boats do stop here fairly often. How often? Well, the next one is due in about two weeks' time. However I hoped you will be my guests, in the meantime. I'm afraid we'll have to, Doctor. Thank you. Well, that's settled then. Ah, let me show you to your rooms. [door closes] Didn't-- didn't we just leave him downstairs in the library? Oh, he wanted to make sure that your room was warm and comfortable before you got here. He sure gets around fast, don't he? Ah, Mr. Summers. Ah, this is your room. Mr. McCarthy's, your quarters adjoin. Excuse me, Mr. Doctor, but didn't you forget something? I think not. No? No. What about me? You will be taken care of. That's what I'm afraid of. In the servant's quarters. Momba will show you the way. Momba? That goblin? Do I have to got with him alone? He won't hurt you if he likes you. And if he don't? Oh, Mr. Bill. Does I has to? Can I stay up here with you? No. You understand. I don't wish to be harsh, but it might set a bad example for the other servants. Certainly. It'll be all right, Jeff. For who? Momba. [speaking german] --[laughing] You ain't by any chance a member of the Mystic Knight of the Pink Garters, is you? [laughing] No? Harlem never was like this. Dinner at 8 o'clock. Make yourselves at home. And I'll get something for your head, Mr. McCarthy. Thank you, Doctor. Whaddya think? I don't know what to think. Are you sure we were flying over this island when we picked up that broadcast? I'd swear to it on a stack of Bibles. And did you notice the lingo he was talking to that banshee? You mean it was the same? Nothing else, but. It was the same blabber we heard on the radio, and I wouldn't be surprised if it was the same voice. [door opens] Oh, pardon me. I should have knocked. Here you are, Mr. McCarthy. Your head will be as good as new in no time. [stairs creaking] Whew. If it was in me, I sure would be pale now. Samantha. Well I do declare. Hello there, bright eyes. Where did you come from? Alabama. Alabama. Ain't that nice. After galavanting around with hatchet face, you is a pleasant surprise. Is you my new associate? Is I? Well if I ain't, that's what I'm thinking of. [chuckles] Hey, who's that? Methuselah? Tahama. I know a museum that would give a fortune just to have her under glass. What's a museum? That's where they keep dead things. Oh, like here. Hmm? What's cooking? That's brew. Brew? Home brew at this day and age? Why don't you people know that probation has been repealed? Taste. I don't care if I do. Phew. How's it taste? I don't know, but it ain't kosher. What's it for? It's a magic potion for scaring away the evil spirits. Evil spirits? Good gracious, oh me! Well, there is evil spirits around here. Why sure. The place is crawling with 'em. And that ain't all. -What? There's more? More? You ain't heard nothing. Just wait'll you see the zombies. Zombies? What's them? Dead folks, what walks around. They does? Here? Especially here. Why here especially? 'Cause this is where they grow the best. They's all over this place. And all you have to do is clap your hands, and they comes a running. [music playing] Who is they? Who is they? Zombies. [screams] [music playing] What kept you so long? Wow! Mr. Bill! Mr. Bill! Mr. Bill! What's the matter, Jeff? I seen 'em. I seen 'em. You saw what? They all over the place. They everywhere. What's everywhere? BARBARA WINSLOW: Heads. Big black ones with frozen faces. With eyes that looks at'cha and they don't see nothing. What's he talking about? Oh, zombies! Mr. Bill, let's get outta here. Why this place is a walking cemetery. Wait a minute, Jeff. What's this all about? What's a zombie? Well a zombie, they is uhm, Mr. Bill, they is-- The living dead. The living dead? That's it. That's what they is. That folks was too lazy to lay down. Your servant seems to have learned a lot in the short time he has been here. Nothing I ain't willing to unlearn just as quick. I'm afraid Jeff's been seeing things. Ain't it the truth. Where did you see these zombies? Uh, Mr. Bill, I saw 'em down into the kitchen. They walked in there just like they owned the place. Huh, undoubtedly some of my servants. No, sir. Not them babies. Why they is fugitives from the undertaker. If it is true what he says, it might be amusing to see these creatures for ourselves. In the kitchen, you say? Yes, sir. That's where I seen 'em. Shall we investigate? Sounds a little crazy. It's all right with me, I guess. How about you, Mac? Yeah, sure. I don't mind. Superstition plays a very important part in the life of these West Indian natives. Of course. This is our kitchen. Crude and rather antiquated, but adequate for our simple needs. Samantha. Yes, Master. Have you seen any zombies here? No, Master. Have you, Tahama? Tahama cooks for the living, not the dead. You see? You better get yourself a pair of glasses, Jeff. Oh, Mr. Bill. I don't need no glasses. I saw 'em with my own eyes. Samantha, you was standing right beside of me when them two perishables walked in. The only perishable thing around here is you, big boy. You've been dreaming. Dreaming? I never dreamt a dream like that in my wildest nightmare. Mr. Bill, they was the real McCoy. He tasted my brew. It made him drunk. [cackling] Oh, Mr. Bill. Don't pay no attention to her. I wasn't drunk. You've got to believe me! You better take it easy, Jeff, and lay off that brew. Now that we have convinced ourselves that there are no zombies here, let's retire to the library. That's for me. No. You stay here. Look out for more zombies. Woman, you is a prevaricator. Don't you prevaricate me. You didn't see no zombies. You just thinks you did. Think? I don't think that good. I seen 'em, and you did too. You told me that all I had to do was to clap-- Stop him! Don't do that. I thought so. Mister, there's something that ain't never no good for nobody to do, no time. Much less going around blabbing off your big mouth about-- You mean that, that Mr. Sangre don't like for nobody to know that he got zombies around here? That's right. How come? What'd he do, grew 'em? No, but he sure cultivates 'em. What for? That's his own business. And if you're smart, you'll keep your big nose out of it. Is you telling me. [stairs creaking] Alyce. You're down early, my dear. Permit me. My wife, Madame Sangre. Mr. Summers, Mr. McCarthy, our guests. How do you do, Madame Sangre? Howdy. My wife isn't quite, uh, herself. She suffers from a strange malady which I'm trying to cure. Here is a peculiar case in contrast to that of the zombies which your servant claims to have seen, where supposedly they are dead, yet retain a certain amount of animation. She lives, yet walks in the land of those beyond. Forgive us if we intruded. I didn't know you preferred drinking alone. I was a little nervous. I thought it might make me feel better. Of course. Permit me. Mr. Summers and Mr. McCarthy, Miss Barbara Winslow, my niece. By marriage. The Doctor, I mean my uncle, has told me of your unfortunate accident. How long do you suppose it will take you to repair the plane and leave? Barbara, how can you talk of leaving to our guests, when they have only just arrived? Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it that way. Ah, you see, my niece doesn't like this little island. She can only think of it in terms of departure. Any place that don't set well with me, Miss, I ups and leaves. Unfortunately that's easier said than done. None may leave this island if he so chooses. How's that? Oh, uh, of course I'm only speaking about myself and my family. You see, Bill, Austrian refugees had to flee without passports. Uh, we had no choice. But we're different, huh? Ha, naturally. You wouldn't be on this island if it hadn't been for your crash. It's that so, Mr. Summers? Well, that's about the size of it. You now, I'm beginning to think these islands are bad luck for planes. Oh, I don't understand. About a week ago one of our Navy planes disappeared in the same region. Oh. Anyone of importance? Yup. Admiral Wainwright. One of our ranking admirals. Mm-hmm. He was on his way to Panama. A mission of some sort for the government. How unfortunate. But of course, I will inform the natives first thing in the morning. And if they can learn of your admiral, I will certainly let you know. Thank you, Doctor. Excuse me. I see you take an interest in my collection. Yeah, they are kind of curious. They constitute my hobby, gathered from all over the world. Relic symbols of black magic, lycanthropy, voodoo. Is that so? Quite so. You're Irish, are you not? Sure, anybody can see that. Now, that should be of special interest to you. Why, me? Because it comes from your country. This ceremonial mask worn by the ancient Druid high priests during the rites of transmigration. Transmigration? Yes, it means the transfer of the soul of the dead to the body of the living. Ain't that kind of tough on the living? [chuckles] Perhaps so. But I know of many who would benefit by a new soul. Lots of people don't believe in that junk anymore, Doc. Well, I hear that in Ireland, a good many do. I don't know about that. Dinner is served. Very interesting, Mr. McCarthy, isn't it? Very. The inconvenience of the material body always demanding to be fed. Come, my dear. The idea of me doing skug dugger in the kitchen. Why that ain't no business for a man who used to resorting with big shots. Who you trying to fool? Why the only big shot around these here parts, is Dr. Sangre. And I sure know you ain't no pal of hisin'. Hmm. I don't intend to be. Why that Dr. Sangre is a little shot compared with Mr. Bill. Who say? I said. And you know why? Did you hear me inquire? It's a secret, but I'll tell ya if you promise not to tell a living soul. Oh, I won't. Leastwise not no living soul. Leastwise? Why woman, is you keeping company with a zombie? Does I look like a widow? What's this secret about Mr. Bill? Well he's on a little special business for the government. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah, they gonna send him all the way to the Bahamas. Samantha. Tahama. [speaking german] Hey, what's up? What's up? It's almost 12 o'clock. The witching hour. Witching hour? What do that mean? It means you better be in bed or the haints'll get you. Haints? Haints? It's their feeding time, and they likes dark meat. Dark meat? You don't have to play no second chord for me to find out who that mean. Where's that bed? You stay here. Oh, mister. I got a date with a dream. You stay here. Aw, couldn't we flip a coin or something to see if I stay, or else? Pay no attention to anything you see or hear. [cackling] Pleasant dreams. Nighty night, sugar pie. Remember! How can I forget to remember? Don't worry, mister. I Couldn't get outta here if I wanted to. Boy, I is petrified. [music playing] Where there's light, there's hope. Boy, I need all the hopes that I can dig up tonight. Sure wish I had learned to burn a candle on both ends. [music playing] Now that's more like it. If I just had me a couple of Lenox Avenue street lights, I could really sleep. [clock chimes] Witching hour. Feeding time for the haints, and I'm caught in the kitchen. [clock chimes] [clock chimes] [clock chimes] [clock chimes] [clock chimes] My goodness! Fire eaters. [music playing] Don't come close to me. I ain't no filet mignon. [music playing] -Good night, gentlemen. -Good night, Doctor. Mr. Bill. Mr. Bill. They after me! They after me! Now what? The zombies. They been trying to get me. Again? Is your servant always like that, Mr. Summers? This ain't no laughing matter, Dr. Sangre. You fooled me once before, but you can't do it this time because I've seen 'em with my own eyes. He seems to be troubled with hallucinations. No, sir. Zombies. That's what I'm troubled with. You know what, Mr. Bill? Why they tried to have me for dinner. [laughing] Nonsense! Zombies don't eat meat. That ain't the way I heard it. Ah, the crack-up must have given him a concussion. You'll be all right in the morning, Jeff, as soon as you have a good night's rest. You right about me needing rest, but I can't get it sleeping down there in that morgue. Oh, you can stay up here with us. Mr. Bill, them is the joyfullest words that I ever heard. Oh, we have so much room in this house, there's no need for him to sleep here. I'll give him an opiate. You ain't giving me nothing. But this is so irregular. Let him stay here, Doc. I know how he feels, and I don't blame him a bit. Well, forgive me. I forgot. After all, he is your servant. Good night, gentlemen. Good night, Doc. Whew! Good gracious, oh me. This joint gives me the willies. I second the motion. Well, I'm not crazy about it either, but there's nothing we can do about it. That's what you think. Nobody leaves this island, huh? Well I'm getting off it if I have to swim! And me, right behind ya. You know that Dr. Sangre has got the hex on us. Now you're both jumping at your own shadows. Shadows? I don't throw them kind of shadows that I saw down in that kitchen. Why, Mr. Bill, this place is zombiefied. But good. Ah, forget it, Jeff. There may be something to that zombie gag, Bill. I've heard of 'em. Ah, go on. When a man's dead, he's dead. Well supposing he's dead and don't know it. Forget it, will you Jeff? And go on to bed. Where am I gonna sleep? Sleep there on the couch. Right over here? Whew! [electricity humming] Hey! What's that? That's a generator as sure as there's shamrocks in Ireland. Maybe it's for the electric lights? Have you seen electric lights around here? Maybe they ain't screwed 'em in yet. There's only one reason for a generator to be on this island. Radio! I don't get it. Why would he lie about the radio when-- That's one of the things that got me mixed up. Well, let me tell you this. If we live through the night and that radio on the plane is OK, I'm gonna camp on it tomorrow, 'til I scare up a gun boat. [snores] [music playing] Good gracious, oh me! Mr. Bill, What's the matter? -What happened? -Everything happened! At first it was zombies, and then it was haints! And now it's a lady ghost! She come right through that wall. Now look, Jeff. The first couple of times was funny, but now you're going too far. Oh, no I ain't, Mr. Bill. She walked right through that wall. Oh, it's your imagination. Go on back to bed. Imagination! Why, Mr. Bill, my imagination ain't that strong. Why, imagination couldn't drop this, could it? Look at that! What is it? It's an earring. Where'd you say she went? She walked right through that wall, just like it wudn't there. Right here, Mr. Bill. I show it to you, too. She walked right through this wall, here. And don't ask me how she done it. Ah, it's solid as a rock. That gets me. Any idea who she was? I didn't ask the lady her name. I was doing pretty good just looking. Whaddya say, Bill? You still think he's crazy? Eh, I'll tell ya better in the morning. The next time you see anything like that, hang on to it. If I do, it's got to catch up with me first. [doorknob rattling] [music playing] Nothing doing. Looks like even the doorknobs are haunted around this joint. I'm gonna find out what this is all about right now! Oh, Mr. Bill. With all these haints around here, does we have to go looking for 'em? Well, you can stay here, Jeff. No, sir. Wherever thou goes, I'll go. I hope it ain't too far. Well, keep your eyes open. Let's have a look downstairs. [music playing] [stairs creaking] It's quiet as a tomb. A tomb? [music playing] [footsteps] Shh. [footsteps] Mac. Yeah? We better split up. Uhm, you don't mean three ways? Uh, Mr. Bill, I think two is better. Look, Jim. Where did you say you saw those things? Oh, Mr. Bill, you ain't going down in that zombie nest? Where is it? Oh, back in the kitchen. That's for me. All right, I'll look around up here. -OK, come on, Jeff. -Who me? No, sir. -Shh! Oh, Mr. Mac. I ain't got no business down there. Pipe down. You gotta show me the way. Does I has to? Can I draw you a map or something? No, go ahead, Jeff. You're wasting your time. Oh, my goodness. Right out of the skillet into the frying pan. I couldn't win tonight if I had crooked dice. Go. I never heard of such a thing. [music playing] Oh, it's you. Do you always sneak up on people like that? Not always. Tonight it seems to be the custom. I thought I'd return your call. Do you mind? My call? It's rather late for research, isn't it? There were some things I had to know. So I noticed. When you want to know a thing you really go after it, don't you? Would you mind, please, telling me what you're driving at? Not at all. This prowling act of yours, what's the idea? Oh, it's my aunt I'm so worried about. She is hypnotized, isn't she? I don't know. I think so, I-- You don't think I did it, do you? Well, I'm in no position to accuse anybody of anything. Look, Mr. Summers. I've got to get my aunt off this island. She's been this way every since she came here. I'm afraid if we don't do something soon, something dreadful is going to happen to all of us. Well, I've got to trust somebody around here. That's a cinch. But in order to help you, you've got to help us. Oh, I'll do anything. Anything I can. Well, we think Dr. Sangre has a radio transmitter concealed on this island. I thought that for a long while. I don't know where he keeps it, but there must be one because he's always getting messages from somewhere. Hmm. Do you think you could find it? I'll try. Swell. We better get back to our rooms. Is-- is there anything else? Not now. I'll see you in the morning. Where'd those zombies come from? They didn't. They sprouted. Just like mushrooms. With a description like that, they're outta be very easy to find. That's just what I'm afraid of. Come on, let's have a look around. Mm-mm. Not me. I'm gonna stay right here. [music playing] --[chuckles] The tropic sure gives a man a color. [chuckles] Don't do that, Mr. Mac. You know my heart can't stand it. [chuckles] You know one thing, Mr. Mac, you see-- Wow! Mr. Mac! Mr. Mac! Mr. Mac! [music playing] Mr. Bill, the zombies got Mr. Mac. [grunts] You all right, Mac? Yeah. Looks like I pulled another Branigan. That's not so bad, it's just a bump. Yeah, two cracks on the bean in one night. How am I doing? I heard someone cry out. It was me, and I wasn't dreaming. Oh, yes. We thought we heard something, Doctor. We came down here to investigate. So Yeah, I got tangled up with one of your ape men, and got the worst of the argument. Too bad, I should've warned you. Some of my servants act as guards at night. Are you sure it wasn't a zombie? Ridiculous! Oh, he knows it wasn't a zombie, Doctor. It was our fault. We should be taking your advice, and stayed where we belonged. You're a sensible man, Mr. Summers. Now let's go back to bed, fellas. I'm sorry, this won't happen again. You know? This dump don't look half bad in the daylight. Yeah, It almost makes last night seem like it didn't happen. Don't kid yourself. That earring happened. You know, I'm beginning to believe this thing was dropped on purpose. Good morning. Good morning. Howdy. I think you dropped this last night. That? Oh no. That belongs to my aunt. I'm so glad I was able to find you alone. There's something I've got to tell you. Hmm, what is it? It's about last night. There's a-- [door opens] Good morning. Having an interesting conversation, my dear? Uh, Ms. Winslow was just telling us about your island. That's right. Oh, how thoughtful of her. Did you sleep well last night? Well, as well as we could with the storm and all. Good. I took the liberty of having some breakfast sent to your room. I hope you didn't mind. Not at all. It was an unexpected treat. You seem to admire my wife's earrings. Oh, I was just a-- My wedding present to her. Hmm, very unique. Quite so. I dare say there's not another pair like them in the world. Really? They were among the few possessions which we were allowed to take out of the old country. You don't say? Well, why you are here, I want you to feel perfectly at ease and do as you like. What are your plans for today? I'm going to take a look at the plane. Uh, yes. We're anxious to see what damage was done by the crash last night. I see. Would you care to join us, Ms. Winslow? Oh, I would love to. No, no. That would be quite impossible. My niece assists me as my secretary. We have a lot of work to do, my dear. Some other time, perhaps. Oh, certainly. Should we go, Mac? I'm all for it. Enjoy yourselves. But don't forget luncheon at noon. Thanks, Doctor. Bill, let's have a look at that earring. They're the same, all right. The only pair like 'em in the world, huh? I don't get it. Neither do I. Barbara didn't drop it. Madame Sangre couldn't have, apparently. Who did? This is the most cockeyed racket I ever bumped into. Well, I'm for getting out of it as quick as possible. Let's get the radio started. Bill! Look there. What about it? Ain't that a fresh grave? So what? You're in a cemetery where it's customary to bury people in fresh graves. Yeah, but that's been dug since the storm last night. Listen, are you getting those zombies on your mind too? You and Jeff make a great pair. You still don't get it. Take a look at that head stone. That guy was buried over a week ago, and somebody must've dug him up. Come on. Boy, will I be glad to get away from this joint. Well, it could have been worse. Hey, Mac. Come here! What's the matter? Is it busted? How d'ya like that? Eh, somebody's dismantled it. Dismantled it? I'll say they have! What next on this devil's island? Mac, we're in a spot. I don't know why, but somebody's trying to hold us here. Trying to hold us, is it? That Dr. Sangre and his Druids and his zombies. He better not try to pull any of his black magic on me! Oh, calm down, Mac. Raving isn't gonna get us anywhere. I'm gonna find that Doc! Are you crazy? Do anything now to make him suspicious, no telling what he might do. Take it easy until we find out what he's up to. Well, maybe you're right. But there's one thing I can do and I'm gonna do it right now! I said take it easy. All I'm gonna do is try and find that generator we heard humming last night. Hey, that's an idea! If the old man's got a radio hidden away someplace, we could sure use it. Let's go. You better let me handle this. Like you said, we don't want to make anybody suspicious. And with two of us snooping around, it mightn't look so hot. OK, I'll go back to the house and try to get Barbara away from Doc long enough to find out what she was trying to tell us. Think you can handle it alone? A cinch. It's right up my alley. My old man used to be a cop. [chuckles] [pounding of jungle drums] [music playing] [slam] [pounding of jungle drums] [chanting in foreign language] Tahama. Yes, Master How much longer? Soon, Master, soon. Voodoo magic works slow, but it is sure. The admiral has fainted. Your magic is no good. It put him to sleep. I am Mammalai, High Voodoo Priestess. I send him in trance so he talk. Too slow. He has valuable information which we must have at once! The three men upstairs may be in the Secret Service. You must make him talk, Tahama! [pounding of jungle drums] [chanting] Dr. Sangre [speaking in german] Dr. Sangre [speaking in german] Have another piece of pie, honey lamb? I all ready had two. You already had six, but does you want another one? Well, if you insist. Boy, you's the most pious man I ever did see. Ain't it the truth. I bet you none of them gals in Harlem never baked you no pie like that. Oh, I don't know. Oh, you ain't so smart. I had me a beau once. And he wasn't no common ol' valet like you neither. Is that so? He was an exporter. An exporter? That's right. Now that's fine. What did he handle? Bags, on the Pullman train. What become of him? He was killed by a revolving crane. A revolving crane? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm! Y'all sure have some fierce birds around this country. Do you miss him much? Not much. I sees him every now and then. You does? Mm-hmm. He's Lazarus. That zombie you met last night. Oh, no, that one? Hmm? Jeff! Oh, it's you, Mr. Bill. You sure gave me a turn. Have you seen Mac? He's been missing since early this morning. So, sir. I ain't seen him. You don't think nothing happened to him? I don't know what to think. Don't mind me, Mr. Bill. I'm on your side. You think we better go look for him? All right. Before we go, run upstairs and get my gun in the bag, will you? What, you gonna shoot somebody? Well, don't ask any questions. Meet me in the library. Yes, sir. [music playing] [door slams] Oh, excuse me, Mr. Doctor. I'm in the wrong room. No I ain't either. This is Mr. Bill's room. What you doing, going through his bag? Jeff, I was looking for you. Looking for me? In there? I've got something to show you. You got something to show me? That's right. I know, Mr. Doctor, but I got business elsewhere. Nonsense. This is far more important. Oh, not to me, Mr. Doctor. What is the matter? Shh. Oh, Doctor. Watch. [music playing] That's where that lady went! What lady? The ghost lady. [music playing] The ghost lady? Ye-- yes, sir. She went right through there. Come. Now wait a minute, Doc. Now wait a minute, Mr.-- Mr. Sangre. [music playing] Mr. Bill ain't gonna like this. Where is you taking me? Quiet. [music playing] Where is we going? Shh. [music playing] Jeff, get a move on, we've got-- You again. What are you doing in here? Where's Jeff? I wouldn't know, Sir. It's gone. You know about this, you devil! Give me that gun! I have no gun, Sir. Don't lie to me! Somebody has. Where's Jeff? Where is he? And Mac, what's happened to him? I wouldn't know, Sir. You're gonna tell me or I'll-- I said I wouldn't know, Sir. You wouldn't spill it if you did know. I'm gonna find him if I have to search every inch of this island. Yes, Sir. [door slams] Look at this watch. See it move. Watch it. You have seen nothing. You know nothing. Repeat after me. I have seen nothing. I know nothing. I have seen nothing. I knows nothing. I don't even know my name. I don't even know my name. I am dead. I am-- I is? Repeat! I am dead. I am dead. I am dead. I have returned to the land of the living. I am a zombie. I am a zombie. I am a zombie. I am a zombie. I am a zombie. I am a zombie. Get over there where you belong. Yes, sir. Move over, boys. I'm one of the gang now. Mac! Jeff! [pounding of jungle drums] Mac! Mac! Where are you? Jeff! [pounding of jungle drums] [drums stop] No! No! No! No! No! Aunt Alyce, think. Think hard. Remember. Try to remember. You've got to get over this. You must speak to me. You must! No. So you're mixed up in this mess too. Oh, no. I was only trying-- I know what you were trying to do. I thought Dr. Sangre was responsible for that. Now I see it's you. Oh, I'm only trying to undo what already has been done. By hypnotizing her, still further? But it's the only way, you must believe me! I wouldn't believe you or anybody else in this madhouse. I suppose next you and your vultures will be after me? Next? Don't pretend that you don't know what happened to Jeff and Mac. Why, no. I-- Look. Mac! He's sick. Get some brandy. Mac, tell me what's a matter. What happened? Where have you been? It doesn't do any good. Well, I hope you're satisfied! No, I didn't-- I saw your friend enter from the jungle. Is anything the matter? What do you think? Well, let's have a look. Hmm. I was afraid of that. He has contracted a very rare and dangerous jungle fever. Is that so? It paralyzes to move to a region of his brain. He must have medical attention at once. Well, you're a doctor. See what you can do about it. I'm sorry, it's beyond my powers. I thought so. You're going to let him die. Not at all. There is a native doctor in the village who knows more about this than I do. We'll send for him at once. I see. Find Momba, and send for Dr. Couillie. Yes, Doctor. You'd better put him to bed. Mr. Summers, this is Dr. Couillie. Charmed, Mr. Summers, I'm sure. How do you do, Doctor. Dr. Couillie was educated in your country. America. Precisely. This is the patient, I presume. Yes, make it snappy. Will you, Doctor? [music playing] I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do. Nothing? Are you sure? Positive. This man has been dead since morning. [music playing] I'm profoundly sorry about the death of your friend, Mr. Summers. What has to be, has to be, I suppose. Did you have to bury him so soon? It was out of my hands. The local law insists. The climate and something even worse makes it necessary. You mean this voodoo zombie business, huh? This voodoo magic is far more real than you think, Mr. Summers. You heard what Dr. Couillie had to say. Oh, but that's impossible. Dead since morning. Things like that have happened before on this island. There are even whisperings going on among the natives, that he was bewitched. Bewitched? But why? What for? Maybe for prying into things that did not concern him. [speaking german], Doctor. [speaking german] Excuse me. What is it? The radio. Word has just come through, they must have the admiral's information at once! We've got to make him talk. We might perform the ceremony. The rights of transmigration. Get everything ready. Inform Tahama, and get Madame Sangre to the dungeon. Madame Sangre? You heard me! Hurry! Tahama. The ceremony [speaking german]. I'll be right along. I'll have to go. You've got to feed the zombies. Me? I can't stand zombies, and you knows it. Do as your told! And you'd better set another plate, for we're going to have company for dinner. Company? You mean there's a new one? That's right. The Irishman from upstairs. [cackling] Well I do declare. Imagine us having a white zombie for dinner. [claps] [music playing] Company, halt. One, two. Jeff. Gang way for King Zombie. What you doing in that lineup? Don't bother me, woman. Can't you see I is a has been? A zombie? Nothing else, but. And don't ask me my name, 'cause I don't know. I don't know nothing. You ain't no zombie. Zombies can't talk. Can I help it because I'm loquacious? How'd you get this way? I ain't telling nothing. All I know is that I joined the club. And as a member, I has privileges. What privileges? Privileges to get fed. That ain't no new development with you. Woman, where is my food? There it is. Help yourself. Company, come and get it! Where's the white one? What white one? The one who flew the plane you come in. He's also one of the new recruits. The only one I know about, is the boys in my squad. Is this the best food you got? The best? For zombies, that am the six bit deluxe special. This being a zombie sure is a drawback. Where's the salt? You eats that the way it is and likes it. Zombies ain't supposed to use salt. I thought you said-- I changed my mind. That's more like it. Take it easy there, woman. I ain't no herring. Now eat. Woo! What is you trying to do, poison me? How's you feeling? How should I feel? You ain't feeling dead, is you? 'Cause if you is, then you's a zombie. And if I ain't? Then you ain't no zombie. The rule says, if a zombie uses salt, he dries up and gets dead again. How do I look? How do I look? Take a look for yourself. --[laughs] Well according to this, I ain't dead. That's all I wanna know. Then you ain't no zombie. How you know? 'Cause when a zombie looks in a mirror, he don't see nothing. That's me all right. Well I ain't no zombie after all! If I ain't no zombie, and they is, what am I doing here? What am I-- Hey, where you going? Jeff, where have you been? What are you doing coming out of there? One at a time, Mr. Bill. I just been reincarnated. You what? I just got de-zombiefied. That's the facts, Mr. Bill. But that's all I remember. Jeff, you've got to remember. These zombies, did you see any of 'em? I just got through eating dinner with 'em. Where any of 'em white? Why do you ask me that? Samantha asked me the same thing down in the kitchen. Uh, I was just thinking of Mac. They were in such a hurry to bury him. Bury him? Is Mr. Mac dead? Yeah. Oh, my goodness. Maybe he's the one that a-- The one? Go on. What one? I was digging in a graveyard. [chuckles] Can you imagine me digging in a graveyard? What about the graveyard? No. That couldn't have been me. Oh, but Jeffrey, you've got-- [distant screaming] What was that? Sounded like a woman's scream. What woman? I don't know, but it sounded like Barbara. I'll get the flashlight. Off again. Down here. I'm coming, but my heart ain't in it. This way. [music playing] Madame Sangre. That's what she got for trying to warn us. Whoever did it can't be far away. You mean can't be too far away. Jeff, look! Eyes, if you look, I ain't responsible for nothing you sees. Mr. Bill, ain't that a coffin? It's Mac's. You don't think he done joined up with the zombies, do ya? I don't know. But if that Sangre thinks he can use Mac's body to-- What's a matter? Listen. [pounding of jungle drums] What does that sound like to you? I don't know, but it ain't Gene Krupa. It's the same drums we heard the other night. Voodoo drums. We gotta find 'em. Oh, Mr. Bill. Ain't we found enough for one day? After this there's no telling what he's up to. Mac might be-- Oh, come on. I'm coming. [pounding of jungle drums] Mr. Bill. Does we has to do this? Quiet, Jeff. I ain't said a word. [pounding of jungle drums] [screaming] [screaming] In there. [screaming] [chanting] [grunts] Uh, it won't budge. Jeff, you were down here. Don't you remember how you got in? I can't remember. Think hard, Jeff. We've got to get in there. Now let me think. [chanting continues] [chanting speeds up] Who are you? Speak! Tell me! Who are you? I am-- I am-- Admiral-- Admiral-- [chanting gets faster] Admiral Wainwright, what were your orders? To go-- To go-- [clacking] Stop! Stop! Momba, you fool! She was just going to talk. Unbelievers, outsiders come in. Get them! Mac, go back! It's Bill, Bill Summers, your pal! Go back! Mac, go back! [screaming] Stop! Go back! Stop! Stop them! [screaming] [bang] [bang] [bang] [scream] Did you contact the Coast Guard all right, Admiral? There'll be a boat here for us in the morning. But how's your friend? Oh, those bullets didn't help him any. He'll need a little patching up when that Coast Guard car gets here, but he says he's raring to go again. Say, by the way, how did that insane doctor manage to get you on this island? Well, he brought our plane down with a false radio beam. He killed the crew and tortured me to get information about our Canal Zone fortifications for his government. Hmm. He didn't succeed at first. And then he decided to try this a, voodoo business. Oh, you mean those-- those rights of transmigration he talked about. Yes, that's right. You see, he tried to transfer the admiral's information to my brain. He was completely mad on the subject of hypnotism. Half the island was under his spell. So first he tried to use Madame Sangre as a subject. And when she broke under the strain, he used Barbara. I hate to think what might have happened if you hadn't turned those zombies against him. If there's one thing that I wouldn't want to be twice, zombies is both of 'em. [music playing]
