Narrator: Titanic, the world's most famous ship. Sunk over 100 years ago and rediscovered in 1985. She fascinates like no other wreck and still has secrets to reveal. Parks: There's sometimes about this story that grips people. Everybody finds something in this disaster, it's so varied and so all encompassing. Narrator: It's nearly 15 years since anyone dived down to see titanic. The world is anxious to know what's happened to her. Victor: There could be a couple of major portions of the titanic that might have collapsed. Narrator: Now, a new expedition is heading for the wreck site. Stuart: Okay, good to go. Radio: Good to go. Narrator: World leading experts armed with state of the art technology. Kelvin: We'll send this bad boy to the bottom. Narrator: It's a race against time to answer questions. Patrick: Okay, tom last check. Radio: Roger that. Narrator: And preserve titanic for future generations. Stuart: Two minutes. Radio: Two minutes. Narrator: Before it's too late. Victor: Let's go back to titanic. Radio: Prepare to dive. Prepare to dive. Radio: Better draw up all stations bridge. Stuart: Eta over the wreck is approximately ten minutes from now. Narrator: The team is arriving at the titanic wreck site. Narrator: The ship lies three miles down in the icy depths of the north atlantic ocean. Rob: Okay so welcome everyone. We wanted to meet this afternoon to go over the dive plans for the next two days, so you have two pieces of paper. Narrator: The team gathers to go over their mission. A plan to carry out a series of dives to titanic over the coming week. Victor: The first thing I'm gonna do when I get down to the bottom is, as I mentioned, I'm gonna just go thrusters off and I'm gonna see what the drift is. Narrator: Victor vescovo has put this expedition together. Victor: There could be a couple of major portions of titanic that might have collapsed. Most people are interested in the bow, because the bow is still quite discernible as the bow of the titanic and I am hopeful that it hasn't significantly collapsed, which would be unfortunate. Narrator: Nobody has dived down to titanic in nearly 15 years. So victor's major concern is what may have happened since she was last examined. Parks: From the first time this wreck was seen in 1985 with each expedition, we've observed the condition of the wreck. Narrator: Victor has gathered world leading experts, to ensure this mission is a success, including titanic specialist, parks stephenson. Parks: I've always seen the wreck as truly the last surviving witness to the disaster, almost like a crime scene. Lori: Well, that one will be fine. I'm just gonna-I have to get dimensions of the first platform that we have, but I'm pretty sure that it won't fit in there. Crew: Yeah. Narrator: Microbial ecologist lori johnston is another key member of the team. She's responsible for collecting important data on the wreck's condition. Lori: From '98, I was able to dive on titanic six different times. The last time I personally saw it was 2005. So it'll be very interesting to see the amount of deterioration. Crew: Okay, roger that, can you confirm the connectors? (inaudible radio) victor: This is the deep submergence vehicle. The limiting factor. It's the deepest diving submersible in the whole world and she is an absolute wonderful sub and a beast. She is so tough. Narrator: The limiting factor was specially designed by the team for missions like this. Patrick: Okay, tom, last check, we're gonna just have tim, or maybe you can just secure your own hatch. Radio: Roger that. Securing hatch. Narrator: When victor isn't piloting the sub, patrick lahey will be. Patrick: Okay, tim. First thing is the pressure hull which is made of titanium. Hull's about 90 mm thick, which is three and a half inches in thickness and it has three view ports. Two that are on the top looking out through the port and starboard sides and then one lower view port that gives you a great view of the areas on the sea floor. Crew: Good. Radio: Turning starboard. Kelvin: I mean everything is so tight, you know, everything is in tight corners. Narrator: The team's fitting the sub with a super high resolution 4k camera. It's been specially commissioned for this mission to film the wreck in the best definition possible. It's big, but delicate. Kelvin: Having this camera here means that we're gonna have to be very very careful. It's gonna make it a lot more difficult for the launch and recovery and we're gonna have to be really really careful. Really careful. Rob: So the hazards are, you know, we are going deep, and the fact that we're diving around a human made object, we're around a wreck structure with potentially strong current. This wreck has been down there for 107 years, so it's inherently unstable and she lies across the current which is running up to two knots at a time. Patrick: Diving around a wreck presents a unique set of risks and concerns. The primary one being entanglement, you know, a wreck can have things like ropes and obstructions and things of that nature, that present a hazard to the craft. Victor: The idea is to go here and then we'll come up here and pretty much, I mean, everyone has told me not to get too close and to be extremely careful, because there are still wires. Narrator: The success of the first dive is vital. It will allow the team to plot additional dives. Failure and the expedition could end abruptly. Rob: Cool. If no one's got any questions, then our next gig is 6:45 up on the foredeck tomorrow morning. Narrator: Preparation is over. Tomorrow, the team will attempt to dive to the most famous ship in history. Stuart: Weather conditions now are worse than they were on the forecast yesterday. Narrator: The first dive is due to be launching in less than an hour. But conditions aren't looking good. The crew's having to secure equipment. Stuart: So, the biggest waves you can see coming through now are probably four, four and a half meters which is pretty much double the maximum limit to operate the sub. (dramatic music) victor: So, you called it. Stuart: It's not a nice decision to make and no one wants to make it, but it's the one that needs to be made so. Victor: Yeah, I agree. Do the people downstairs know? Narrator: The first launch is aborted. If the bad weather doesn't pass soon, the entire mission will be in jeopardy. Victor: Let's go down in mission control, just to announce it to everybody. Stuart: Okay, good to go. Radio: Good to go. Narrator: Next morning, there's a break in the weather. Radio: Setting five minutes. Stuart: Five minutes, okey doke. (music) (radio chatter) narrator: The dive is on. Kelvin: We're going to the titanic. Weather's not bad. It was rougher last night, I thought it was gonna be kind of rough this morning, but it's laid down a bit, so I'm comfortable with this, we can launch in this. We'll send this bad boy to the bottom. Narrator: This will be the first ever solo dive to titanic. Stuart: Two minutes. Radio: Two minutes. (music) male: Good luck, victor. Say hello to the old girl. Victor: I will. Let's go back to titanic. (music) radio: You're clear to dive, clear to dive. Victor: Roger that, lf is clear to dive, I've got a green board, pumps are now in. Narrator: It will take victor one and a half hours to reach titanic's depth. Parks: As you drop, light starts to fade, hazy greenish at first and then gives way to black, black, black, until it's pure black. There's nothing really much to see. So you descend into blackness. Narrator: The wreck is nearly three miles down where extreme water pressure will push the sub and camera technology to the very limit. Victor: Surface lf, present depth one one two zero heading zero three seven life support good. Patrick: Roger lf, understand your depth is one one two. Narrator: 4k cameras have seldom filmed so deep before and even if this one survives the journey, what will be left to film? Victor: Surface lf present depth three eight zero eight at bottom, heading one eight zero. Narrator: The first man dive in nearly 15 years is underway, to the world's most famous ship, titanic. Parks: If we arrive on site and the light starts to reveal massive collapse, either like I'm predicting, or even worse, I'm sure there's gonna be an instance of regret. Narrator: Titanic was the most luxurious liner in the world. When she set sail in April 1912, heading for new york, over 2000 passengers and crew were on board. Four days into her maiden voyage, she it an iceberg and sank. Around 1500 people lost their lives. Parks: There's something about this story that grips people. The way the disaster played out, the length of time that it played out, allowing all these different human dramas and different classes of people, everybody finds something in this disaster. It's so varied and so all-encompassing. Victor: It looks like the edge of something. Just kind of keeps pushing me. Narrator: Where titanic rests is incredibly dangerous. Strong currents swirl around the wreck, making it extremely difficult for victor to reach and film his target. Victor: I'm hitting a one eight zero. I'm being very careful, I don't wanna run into anything. Where is it? I can't see it. There doesn't appear to be anything here. I've a bad feeling about this. There we go. There she is. Oh, my gosh, I'm at the bow. I'm at the bow of the titanic. (music) surface, lf has gone to bow of titanic. Patrick: Yeah. Victor: Just seeing the wreck outside the view port, wow, amazing. Narrator: Victor can now begin the team's next objective, to film the wreck and collect data, to assess its condition. Victor: Coming up along the side here, I can see rust formations hanging from the famous handrails and there, you can see some of the a deck square windows. Narrator: Victor pilots the sub along the ship's exterior. Curtains of corrosion can be seen enveloping port holes. When titanic was first discovered in 1985, she was in remarkable condition but her stern and bow were located 600 metres apart, having broken up on their descent. As victor heads past the bow, towards the stern, there's evidence of human tragedy all around. Victor: Wow, the sea floor it's littered with debris from the ship breaking up, as it descended through the water column. I can see tiles, some even intact bottles, what looks to be crockery. There also seems to even be a perfectly preserved pair of trousers. On approaching the stern, I've got a big old sonar return. I see you on the sonar, girl. Can you see this? That's the stern. Wow, just savaged. Yeah, this is concerning, there's jagged metal protruding almost from all directions and I can feel a strong current pushing me towards the wreckage sometimes. Narrator: The dive has just become much more dangerous. Narrator: A deep sea sub is investigating the wreck of titanic. Victor: Wow, just savaged. Narrator: At the stern, a powerful channel of fast flowing water now jeopardizes the safety of the dive. Victor: I can feel a strong current pushing me towards the wreckage sometimes. Narrator: After several hours fighting dangerous conditions victor decides it's time to return to the surface. Victor: Surface, this is lf ascending. Narrator: For the safety of the mission. Victor: I am exhausted. (music) victor: Hi. (music) (laughs) kelvin: Oh finally hey? Victor: Done bow and stern. Kelvin: Good one. Good one. Parks: This dive is completed, the sub's pulled in, but really my work starts now. All of the analysis work that goes into the footage. I've got to try and get that done and get things identified, so it's gonna be two busy days for me. Victor: In a way, it was the most difficult dive I've ever done, simply because of the scale and the very strong currents and visibility. So, it was very much diving into the unknown and coming back with new information. The condition of the wreck and, you know, what had happened in the last ten years. Narrator: The first dive has been a great success, it's revealed titanic is continuing to decay, but she's still in tact. This new information is allowing the team to begin the next phase of their mission. A more detailed forensic investigation. Parks: Yeah, that's a deck promenade and this is the b deck here, c deck port holes here. This is starboard side. Oh, this is badly corroded up here, look at that, oh, it's gone. Victor: What's gone? Parks: Right, look at a deck, right after narrator: Titanic specialist, parks, is studying the footage, to assess the state of the ship. Victor: What collapsed? It's part of the, parks: It's, the a deck. Narrator: By comparing the footage with images recorded after titanic was first found, he can see the bow is still recognizable, but the stern is showing greater break up. Victor: The stern was absolutely shattered on impact and so, it is a mass of steel and cables and fragments and I don't think it's been properly conveyed just how dangerous that area is and, frankly, how unrecognizable. Narrator: Strong currents swirling around and eroding metal are partially responsible for titanic's deterioration, but experts think there is another reason for the ship's uneven rate of decline. Lori: Titanic is unique, in the fact that it is dominated by bacteria. Narrator: Microbial ecologist lori johnston is one of the only people in the world who can fully understand what is happening. On previous expeditions, lori investigated an phenomenon only seen on some of the deepest wrecks in the world. Titanic is teeming with microscopic life. Lori: Titanic obviously, had bacteria when it went down and they basically have become the dominant organism. Narrator: The bacteria thrive in areas where metal is damaged like buckles or fractures. It is here that rusticles first form. Lori: The term rusticle was sort of coined when the titanic was found and it looks like rust coloured icicle. They're very sophisticated structures, because they're made up of microscopic organisms. So when you put a rusticle under the microscope, the features in them are extremely detailed. Narrator: These organisms have adapted to eat metal and their feed rate looks set to intensify, increasing the rate of decay. Lori: The bacteria themselves seem to be increasing, simply because there's nothing there that can out compete them, and because there's so much steel there and they're just in their glory, taking out all of the elements under the sea. Narrator: This is a worrying discovery, but there is one advantage, the breakup allows the team to see inside new areas of the wreck. Elliot: I can show you how I've put it together, which is mainly using a process called photogrammetry, so we've basically reconstructed the path of the submarine. Parks: So, this is what victor was looking at on his first dive. The bow going down the starboard side. Ah, that's amazing. Narrator: Creating this scientifically accurate model is one of the team's core objectives. It's allowing parks to view titanic from all angles, to see things in far greater detail, than what is possible from diving or studying video footage. Parks: Oh, okay rotate back around, okay and then bring it up. Okay, that's good, I mean, oh, that is something else. Narrator: Even this early in the process, the model is allowing parks to investigate stories from titanic in unprecedented detail. Parks: The way the 3d has rendered here and has that corner, I mean, it really feels like the ship here. Narrator: On the night titanic sank, more than 2000 passengers were onboard. The crew rushed towards the lifeboats, to be lowered into the water using a small crane called the davit. On the model parks is intrigued by one davit, in particular. Parks: Right in this very area, first officer murdoch was desperately trying to load the last lifeboat into the davit, so that it could be launched properly. You can see that this davit is cranked in. It's the only one on the wreck that's like that. Elliot: Right. Parks: That really supports the account that murdoch was trying to launch the last lifeboat, when he and his crew were swept away by the water. Narrator: The photogrammetry has provided vital evidence of the davit's position, proving that this lifeboat was never launched. Parks: I mean, I can almost visualise the scene, seeing it in this lighting and at this angle. So, that's pretty touching. Narrator: There were just 20 lifeboats in total, only enough for around half the passengers. There's another personal story related to titanic that has fascinated parks for years. It's connected to one of the ship's most famous passengers, benjamin guggenheim. He was one of america's wealthiest and most prominent businessmen, who was said to have dressed up in his best and prepared to go down like a gentleman. This is what guggenheim's state rooms would have looked like, titanic's most opulent living quarters. Located on the port side at the point of destruction, where the ship split in two. The state rooms were torn off and feel to the sea floor, where they remain to this day, undiscovered. Now, using the sub, parks is determined to find them. Radio: The free boat is engaged, would you like me to engage surfacing? Narrator: The team is preparing the sub for the next dive. To locate the remains of titanic's most opulent cabin, where one of the ship's most famous passengers, benjamin guggenheim, spent his final days. Sindbad: I'm the only member of my family, going back to where my great great grandfather last stood. So, there is something quite powerful about that, I guess, and kind of getting closer to the rest of the family and maybe paying one last homage. Narrator: Sindbad is benjamin guggenheim's great great grandson. He's joined the expedition, to discover more about the final hours of his ill-fated relative. Parks: Now, these are the decks, they're laying on top of each other, what you're seeing are the ribs that support the underside of the decks and then it appears to be shell plating underneath. Narrator: Previous expeditions revealed an image that parks thinks could be guggenheim's missing state rooms. He wants to dive down on the wreck, to investigate further. Victor: Well, parks is one of the world's leading historians on the titanic and he's the kind of individual that can look at a piece of wreckage and identify where it was on the ship and why it's interesting. Parks: Each piece, its position, its condition, tells a story. Narrator: Parks also wants to record high resolution footage of some specific features on the bow, to add to the photogrammetry model. Once again, victor will pilot the sub. Parks will join him to observe. Parks: I feel the need to go down there myself, owe it to those who perished in the disaster, to maybe step out of the comfort zone a little bit, take an acceptable amount of risk and experience it for myself. Narrator: The sub will dive to the wreck site, travel over the bow, then out across the debris field, searching for the mysterious piece of metal. Patrick: Here comes the water, cap's on, are you ready? Radio: Yeah, roger that, my hatch is secure. Patrick: Roger that, hatch secure. Here we go. Just gonna put a little bit more on here. Narrator: If parks's theory is correct, it'll be an incredible discovery connecting a family across generations. Patrick: Clear to go ahead and start pumping. There goes the swimmer. Radio: Lf. Victor: This is the lf, go ahead. Kelvin: You're clear to circle. Victor: Roger that, the swimmer is clear, I have armed thrusters. We're beginning to pump in now. Narrator: The sub begins its long descent. Benjamin guggenheim was born into a wealthy mining family in philadelphia in 1865. He was 47 years old, when titanic sank leaving behind a wife and three young daughters. Victor: Surface lf, depth three eight zero five heading three one zero, life support good, wreck on sonar. Patrick: Roger that lf, understand, three eight zero five metres heading three one zero degrees with life support good and wreck on sonar. Congratulations. Narrator: The sub has reached the wreck site. Victor: Ha, it's murky. You can look down there and see pretty well. Parks: I can see it, yeah. Victor: Actually, the visibility's better looking down. Parks: It is. Victor: There's the marconi room, one of the windows, one of the skylights. Parks: Lets see here. Narrator: Before searching for the remains of the guggenheim state rooms, the team films additional footage of other important features, for later analysis, including the area around the captain's quarters. Parks: Okay, I can barely see it, I can barely see it, yeah, it's devastated. I see a glimpse of the tub. Narrator: Next, the team turns their attention to the search for guggenheim's state rooms. The debris field is 15 square miles in size. Finding a single piece of metal is like trying to find a needle in a haystack. Victor: Is this the bigger piece? Parks: No, it's not the bigger piece. Victor: What is this? Parks: I don't think it's guggenheim either. Narrator: Parks is searching for specific structural features that coincide with the state room's location aboard the ship. This is key to confirming the identify of the mystery object in the image. Victor: Getting close to something up there on the left. 40 meters. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, eyes out, eyes out, eyes out. Parks: Okay. Victor: This might be the guggenheim piece, you see all that ribbing? Parks: Yeah. This might be the guggenheim piece. Victor: I'm gonna translate more. Parks: Please translate left, yes, please. Yeah here we go, this is it. This is it, this is guggenheim's state room, right here. -Right along here. Victor: Found it. Parks: That's his state room right there. That's guggenheim. Victor: Good job. Teamwork. Surface lf, present depth, three eight zero two, life support good, at guggenheim. Radio: Roger, lf, at guggenheim. Congratulations. Urn off the flow. Narrator: The search is over for the remains of benjamin guggenheim's state rooms. Sindbad: I can't believe you found it. Parks: The odds of this were astronomical, but it just so happened in this case, your great great grandfather's state room was situated in an area that had identifiable features, yes, the odds were astronomical. Sindbad: That chaos is really what's for me, really, the most traumatising, I think, you know, when you're there, when you see this and everything, it's just very powerful. Parks: One thing it does show, that at the end, it did not matter what class you were from, they all died equally. Sindbad: Exactly, yeah. Absolutely. Parks: In those rare instances where we can provide identification of a piece to a descendant of someone who perished, I think it's very much appreciated. Sindbad: We all like to remember those like fairy tales of him dressed in his best, as he sank, sipping brandy and just going down heroically, I guess, but, yeah, what I'm seeing here, like the crushed metal and everything is just showing me a very different reality. Narrator: Finding guggenheim's state rooms allows the team to add another crucial part to their photogrammetry model. Elliot: And then we're coming up now to the top. Parks: Okay, there's the overhang from a deck. Narrator: Additional data from the most recent dive has now been added to the model. It's allowing parks to understand other areas of titanic in far more detail. Parks: It took us a while to recognise this. Narrator: Including the cabin of captain edward john smith, who famously went down with his ship. When titanic was rediscovered in 1985, the contents of captain smith's bathroom were revealed to be largely intact, including his private bathtub. It's a tiny, but very tangible detail of the lives of individuals who lived and worked aboard the ship. So parks wants to see how it's faring. Parks: This entire overhead has now collapsed, since we last saw it, only a small sliver of the captain's bath tub remains. This collapse was exactly the kind of failure that we were expecting to find and I expect this kind of collapse is gonna continue in various areas around the wreck, in the years to come. Narrator: The captain's quarters have lost their battle with decay. Next, parks turns his attention to another area of the ship, that's of great interest, the marconi room. As the biggest and best ship of her day, titanic contained state of the art technology, including the famous marconi radio transmitter. The set aboard titanic was among the first of its kind ever built. It was housed in the marconi room, located on the boat deck, between the first and second funnels. The transmitter was used to receive warnings of icebergs and send distress messages, something ships hadn't been able to do until the end of the 19th century. Parks: My biggest fear is my favourite part of wreck, the marconi wireless telegraph room, is gone and any hope of recovering that transmitting apparatus and restoring it is no longer a possibility. Narrator: On a previous expedition, parks saw the marconi room and its contents were in good condition now he wants to view its current state in detail, as he couldn't see it clearly during his dive with victor. Parks: I wanna go in here, I wanna see what that is, I wanna get in here. I can actually see rusticles hanging down inside, so that indicates there's a whole space in here. Narrator: Parks is hoping the photogrammetry will allow him to see the marconi room in far greater detail. Parks: The area that I'm interested in is right in this area right here. Now, your data set falls off here, but these holes right here are of special concern to me, because this looks like the beginning of,now, now, pull out a little bit. Elliot: Sure. Narrator: The three dimensional photogrammetry is revealing a new depression in the roof of the marconi room. Parks: It's gonna continue to fall and next time we come out here, there's gonna be a new hole next to that one. Oh, we are definitely in a race against time here. Narrator: An investigation into the condition of titanic is revealing a mixed picture. Some of the wreck's features have deteriorated. Parks: I see a glimpse of the tub, I can barely see it and yeah, it's devastated. Narrator: Whilst others have barely changed. Parks: Overall. The wreck seems to be holding up surprisingly well. There are some areas of concern, advanced deterioration and we're gonna to be assessing those going forward, to try and get better predictions on how much longer the wreck will be with us. Rob: We wanted to take this moment, to remember those that have perished the night that titanic sank. Narrator: As the expedition enters its final stages, the team is honouring titanic's victims. Rob: And we'll take a moment's silence. Narrator: With the ceremony complete, the team prepares for their next dive. Rob: It's a good opportunity to think about the site itself and to start planning the dive. I wanted to go beyond the dive, to talk about a science programme, about the permanent conditions. Narrator: The dive will help the team understand and predict titanic's future. Rob: They've taken a number of different types of metal and then they've subjected them to different kinds of activity. Some of them have been subject to torsion, some of them have been heat treated with a welder, some have been riveted. So, they're trying to replicate all the different kinds of metal that you might find on a ship and then subjecting it to the sort of forces that a ship in distress might suffer. Narrator: The team wants to place the data platform next to the wreck. It's a non-invasive, but scientific way to record decline. The platform is made of steel, just like titanic. Lori: The bacteria will start populating that steel source, so then we can bring that up after x number of years, it's considered a long term experiment, and analyse it, to again correlate that back to the deterioration rate of the wreck. Victor: You can see the very obvious manipulator arm, that's very powerful, but it can function all the way down to full ocean depth. Narrator: The sub's manipulator arm will be used to place the steel platform on the sea floor, but doing this, three miles down, in the dark and with strong currents, won't be easy. Kelvin: It'll be a challenge, there's no doubt about it, but I'm up for the challenge. Victor: Good luck, guys. Kelvin: Thanks, victor. Narrator: Kelvin is going to be operating the manipulator arm. And for this dive, patrick is piloting the sub. Patrick: You got her? Kelvin: Yep. Bring this bad boy down. Narrator: The sub will be supported by a remotely controlled lander, that will safely transport the data platform to the sea floor. Radio: You've got three swimmers below, you can start to pump and dive. Patrick: Roger that. Turning pumps on now. Okay? Kelvin: Yep. Patrick: Okay. Narrator: Having arrived at the wreck, the team prepares to release the platform. But, at this step just the simplest of actions is fraught with difficulty. Patrick: Looking good. Narrator: The next task is to drop the platform in a safe place, as close to the wreck as possible, so rusticles can latch on. Kelvin: Yeah, so bring it down to the ground here. Patrick: Got close enough? Looks pretty close. Kelvin: Here, let me get the arm going again. Yeah, yeah, yep (laughs) narrator: When the platform is retrieved in years to come, on a new expedition, the rusticles captured will be vital in predicting titanic's future. The team's mission is complete and the first manned dives to titanic in nearly 15 years have come to an end. (laughs) patrick: Thanks very much, frank, for getting us back. (music) narrator: The expedition has led to the creation of the the most accurate photogrammetry model of the wreck ever built. Titanic, as no one has seen her before. And now she's beginning a new life as an artificial reef. Home to an abundant and diverse array of marine creatures. Lori: Honestly, there's more life on titanic now, than there was when she was floating on the surface. Narrator: But, in time, as titanic's decline continues, she will become unrecognisable. Lori: There's lots of varying opinions on titanic. Is there any way that we can preserve it? But, I sometimes feel that people miss the point of the recycling aspect. This is a natural process. It was built through iron ore and the earth is reclaiming that iron ore from titanic. Parks: It's a shipwreck that's returning to nature, but that doesn't mean that we're done exploring titanic yet. This deterioration has now opened up new possibilities to learn more about the wreck. We went down there to look, to document, and to assess. The results of this expedition wildly exceeded our expectations. (music) captioned by subtitlepro llc
