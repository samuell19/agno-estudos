- I'm calling the cops. - You had a stop sign, why didn't you just... What do you think you are doing? No! Shut up. We have to stop. There's an accident. Tell the children to look the other way. Play hurt! What happened? Everybody, sit down. Move over, lady. Keep your eyes on that window. Boy, you deaf or something? Shep, boot it! Back off, fuckers, or I'm shooting again. Keep moving. Shep, put all these in the barn in front of you. - Let's go. - Get them up there. Shoot at them, Shep. - Keep going. - Get in here, pull that door shut. - Hello, Potter. - Henderson, what are you doing here? I'm Deputy SAC, Albany. Did Lebow and Geller get in? Geller is in there. Lebow is 20 minutes behind you. - How many of our people are on site? - Seven, including me. - Why so few? - That's all I had available. What about Hostage Rescue? Team One is in Miami on a DEA raid. Two is in Chicago on a bank robbery that went barricade this morning. So, what do I do for muscle? Well, you got a raft of locals out there. I don't trust locals. As I recall, Potter, you don't trust anybody. Sir, the director is going to be in the AG's office at 3:00. He wants you to call him then. Thanks, Toby. Nice job setting this up. Thank you, but I just got here. This is all State stuff. It belongs to Sgt. Roger Elb over here. - Very good, Sergeant. - Thank you, Mr. Potter. We are capable of receiving any digitized or microwave communications. We've got the high-speed data links to the FBI mainframe... and Toby explained to me how you like to monitor the press. - So I'm setting that up now. - Very good. - I understand we have deaf hostages? - Yeah. From a local school. We'll need an interpreter, someone from the school. We're working on it. Sergeant, do you have an extra flack vest and a bullhorn? - Yes, sir. - John. - Yeah? - About Mrs. Potter, I... Thanks, Toby. I got your very nice note. - Sorry I didn't write back. - Don't mention it. Here you go, sir. - Who is in charge? - Mr. Henderson, with the FBI. I am John Potter from the FBI. I guess that would make you in charge, then. I'm Lenny Budd. Sir, my men were pretty excited when they heard you were coming. Are you in charge of the state troopers here, Captain? Yes, sir. I am. But why don't you just call me Lenny? Okay, Lenny, what's the situation? You see those two boarded-up windows? There's been some kind of movement. Glints, maybe a gun barrel or a scope. - Then, they seem to... - We'll get to that. How many people do you have here? I've got 37 troopers and six police from the town of Beaumont, their whole force. Where are they deployed? Behind those trees is the river. I've got seven in the trees over there. I've got 10 in this grove to the left. I've got eight covering the field out back... and six that you see here. Who is in charge of the local police? Gene Stillwell. He is the chief of the Beaumont police force here. - Do you want to meet him? - No. In a minute. Leave the people in the trees where they are. These troopers here, pull them back. Everywhere in front of this point, just consider the kill zone. From now on, anyone out there needs to be in good cover with full body armor. Second, those news vans out back, move them. At least a mile away. Mr. Henderson said they would be okay there. - Did he? - They won't like being moved, sir. Fuck them. They've got long lenses. Let them use them. We have never done anything like this before, sir. We'll get sued. Fine. They can sue. - Wait here. - Yes, sir. I figured it out. - Yeah? - Yeah. The cattle, they are out in the stockyard, right? They channel them through here, one by one. And then, bam! Bullet in the head. That's what they do. - They just shoot them, right? - No kidding. And they get hoisted up on to these hooks. They get spun around here... through here toward the guys down here, and then... What? What's going on? What? Come on. What's going on? Get up. - What's up? - I don't know. Kind of exciting, huh? Exciting? - I'm Sonny. - Hey. They don't want to fuck you, so just leave them alone. Shit, Handy. I was just talking to them. I don't want you fucking them, either. So you just keep it tucked in, boy. You men in the building. This is John Potter. I'm with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. I would like to talk to you men in there. - We'll have a cellular phone brought up. - Well, well. - In about 10 minutes. - Mr. John Potter. - We are not planning an assault. - Guess we're finished, boys. - Why? Who the hell is that? - Shit. He's John Potter. He's with the FBI. And they are not going to attack, but they are sending us a phone. I thought you was deaf, lady. She is, but she reads lips. Her name is Melanie and she's a teacher. I'm just the bus driver, but I'm going to... I'm really happy for you, but would you mind shutting your fucking mouth? Excuse me? What was that little motion she made? What was that? What did that one there say to me? She said, "Please don't hurt the children. " Yeah? Tell me what she said. What did she really say, lady? She said you were an asshole. That's what I thought you said. You're right. - All these roads are sealed, right? - Yes, sir. And I want the river sealed, too, both directions. - That's the Niagara River, sir. - I know. I want it closed. See, downriver, closer to Lake Ontario... the Coast Guard's on our side, Canadian Coast Guard on their side. They've both been alerted. But up here, we got a lot of rapids. We can't use regular boats there. You have to use those Zodiac boats. Neither the Coast Guard nor the police have any. Fine. Borrow some men from the Coast Guard. Rent some of those boats. Buy them if you have to, but block the river. - We are ready for you, John. - All right. Let's take this inside. - You okay, John? - Yeah, I'm fine, Henry. Potter himself, seen here in file footage, was wounded by flying debris... and was hospitalized for 16 weeks, during which time... his wife of 26 years died of an unrelated illness. I didn't watch those hearings, you? After weeks of congressional investigation... Potter was exonerated of wrongdoing in the massive explosion. Indeed, some observers credit the FBI... with avoiding a much more serious disaster... had the bomb gone off in the original target. Still, critics of the FBI voiced protest over Potter's return to his high-level post... and Houston has been coupled with Waco in the minds of many. Except for his congressional testimony, Potter has never made any public... Pardon me, Mr. Potter. And in case anybody is interested, that's still true. I have nothing to say about Houston. Okay, let's all get up to speed. We've established a threat management team here... myself, my intelligence officer, Henry Lebow... my communications officer, Toby Geller, and Capt. Budd, who'll serve as my deputy. There will also be a containment officer who I haven't picked yet. All right. At 1:30 this morning, these three escaped... from the Lewisburg Maximum Security Federal Penitentiary in central Pennsylvania. Theodore Jeremiah Handy. Shephard Wilcox. Ray "Sonny" Bonner. Handy is serving a life sentence for robbery, arson and murder. Seven months ago, he, Wilcox, Handy's girlfriend, and another perp... robbed the President's Federal Savings Bank in Pittsburgh... made off with $2,200,000. And as I recall, they never found the loot. They apprehended Handy and Wilcox in Canada three weeks later. The girlfriend got away. And the other perp was killed in a firefight. Handy's girlfriend, Pris Gunder, was never apprehended. - We don't even have a picture. - What about him? Bonner and Handy were cellmates. He was in Lewisburg for interstate flight. Suspected serial rapist. About that containment officer, have any of you had HR experience? You were going to say something, Chief? No. Well... We did have a situation on a farm. A fellow killed his wife and was threatening to do the same with his two boys. What did you do, Chief? I didn't really know what to do. We didn't have any of this stuff. I talked to him. I spent about 20 hours on the phone. - And you stayed with it the full time? - Yes, sir. - How did it end? - He came out. He gave himself up. And the boys? They were okay, apart from seeing their mother that way. Good work. You are my containment officer, if that's all right with you. Yes, sir. Anything I can do to help. Could I talk to you outside for a second? What the hell is going on? That's my job and you goddamn well know it. You don't have the sort of temperament I need for this containment. And that upstate hick does? With all due respect, sir, you've been gone a long time. Meanwhile, there has been lots of training... based on mistakes made at Waco... - Ruby Ridge, and Houston. - I wrote those manuals. I was there in Houston and that was your call all the way. You're relieved of duty at this barricade, Agent. Order your team to report to Chief Stillwell and evacuate the site. That big rep of yours might have skated you past some congressmen... but inside we know it is running out of wind. My reputation is irrelevant, Henderson. It is my authority that counts. Let's go over the rules of the engagement. There will be no rescue attempts whatsoever. We will keep the takers within 100 yards of the building. They will not cross that boundary. If any of them attempt to do so, your troops are cleared to fire. Shoot to wound unless there is a direct present threat to a hostage. Got that? - Where is the throw phone? - It's ready. Let's go to work. I was wondering... You hardly said two words about them kids in there. What's your point? Shouldn't you have reminded everybody... that our number one priority is getting them out alive? That's not our number one priority at all. Our number one priority is to end this situation with a minimum loss of life. I'm not sure I fully understand that. This way he can only kill the nine hostages. Jesus. Maybe we can save those kids in there and maybe we can't. But we can sure as hell keep them from killing anybody else. The only way they are coming out of that building... is in handcuffs or body bags. Clear enough for you? We've got gas, but it ain't gonna work. I don't think it's run since 1950. Yeah, figures. How much gas we got in that canister there? Nearly full. You planning on doing some plumbing in here? What the hell do you think you're doing? Put that back in the duffel bag right now. What the hell is all this shit for? It's none of your damn business, is it? Get back to that fucking window where I put you and watch for them goons. Moron. This trooper is going to make the run with that phone. - What's your name, Officer? - Steven Cardy, but I go by Stevie, mostly. - How old are you? - I'm 22, sir. You're the high-school quarterback that joined the troopers for excitement? - How do you know that? - You have that look. - Enjoying it so far? - Yes, sir. I am. I'm sorry, sir. I mean, it's a terrible situation. - I'm happy to help as much as I can. - I know what you mean. I don't want any heroics today. You see that pen out there? I want you to move up there and you pitch this... as far as you can towards the front door of that slaughterhouse. What if I hit the building with it? It's a special phone and the bag is padded. If you hit the building from there, you ought to give up law enforcement... and try out for the Jets. Yes, sir. Okay. This is Agent Potter again. One of my men is going to throw this phone as close as he can. This is not a trick. It is simply a cellular phone. Will you let our man approach? You can go. - Are you sure that means yes? - They would have said no with a bullet. - Go on. Keep low. - Yes, sir. What the hell is he doing? I don't know, sir. Maybe he wants to get closer. That's far enough, Stevie. Throw it from there. Mark down, first contact with the hostage. Content? What's the communication? I don't know. Where's the interpreter? - Christ! - They're on their way. Set up a video camera with a telephoto lens... and keep it focused on that upstairs window. Right. - Yeah. - Theodore Handy? - Yeah! - This is John Potter, FBI. I'd like to talk to you, Ted. Can I call you Ted? Well, you got us surrounded... you got a lot of goons up there in the trees with guns... you can pretty much call me whatever you want to. Ted, this is a real tense situation. No, I'm not tense, I'm not tense at all. In fact, I'm really relaxed... 'cause I'm getting ready to shoot one of these little kids. Ted, I don't think you want to kill anybody. - Do you go by Jack? - John, actually. Okay, Jack, now what makes you think... that I'm not going to shoot myself one of these kids? 'Cause if you do that... I have to conclude that you plan to kill all of them. That's when we come in and take you out. Bullshit! That's bullshit. There's no way you're going to take... a chance at coming in here and shooting one of these kids. I'm asking you not to kill anyone, Ted. Can I have your word on that? Well, I don't know, Jack. Should I or shouldn't I? Like, should I or shouldn't I? You know how that happens sometimes... you just can't make up your fucking mind? Mr. Potter, I'm Constance Stanley from Laurent Clerc school. We've been anxious for you to get here. How are they? They're all still alive, as far as we know. - You brought the profiles? - Yes. Here, please sit down. - The young teacher? - Melanie Charrol. She signed something to me from the window. I'm sorry, it's not funny. It's just that you're making the sign for drink. Could it have been this? - That's it. - That's the sign for help. - That makes sense, she wants help. - Right. But if you're doing it correctly, then she wasn't saying, "You help. " She was saying, "Help you. " - Help me? - Yes. Well, I mean, I can't be sure. I don't understand her wanting to help me, I can understand her wanting help. I can even understand her wanting a drink. When this is over, I'll buy her a double martini. - How're doing? How's everybody doing? - God, what are you doing now? I sure hope nobody smokes. I chew, but I gave up smoking years ago. - Yeah. - Jack, how you doing? Listen, I want to introduce you... to Donna, she's the bus driver. Yeah, here, say hi, and then tell him exactly what I'm doing. Go. He's sprinkling gasoline... - all over the room. - How are the children? They're fine, except for Beverly. She has asthma... - and these fumes aren't going to help... - Let's go, down the stairs, honey. Tell them exactly what I'm doing now. Don't miss a beat. He's sprinkling gasoline all the way down the stairs. Keep going, honey. Turn to your right, all the way down to the bottom. We're going down. We're on the second floor. Head's up, Shep! Baby! What's that there? - It's a lantern. - Tell him. - He's pointing to a lantern. - Right. What would happen if that lantern fell over? - The third floor would go up in flames. - Good. Stand right there. Jack, did you hear that? Do you get the picture? We get the picture. Good, hang on a sec, Jack. I'll be with you in a second here. Hey, Sonny. This here's gonna be your spot, it's gonna be your post, okay? I want you right there on the steps. In case any of those little canary birds come down here, toss that lantern over. If someone tries to shoot or come in the windows, toss the lantern over. Come on, man, that means I'm stuck here with them up there... I'm here alone and you guys are downstairs. - You got a problem with that? - No. Let's go, walk. Jack, you're still there? Listen, this here is something neat... - I'm going to let the bus driver go. - No. - Wait! Let one of the children go, please. - No. This is your lucky day, darling. - Great, Ted. I appreciate that. - I want to let you know that I'm not all bad. - Check you later. - How are you going to talk to them? Melanie and me is going to get along just fine, darling. - Go on out there and meet her, Stevie. - Yes, sir. Why would he tell us about the gasoline and then send her out? John, don't try it. John! Get down! Don't run. No, stay down! Get on the ground! Downlink! - Potter. - Jack. There's one thing you got to understand about me. I don't care about that bus driver. I don't care about the teacher or these little boys and girls. These are all just like little birds I use to shoot back home... off my front porch. Now, you can go pick her up. I'm not going to shoot you. You just better give me what I want. - And what do you want? - Get back to you on that. Should we move some of our people closer? No, we do nothing. Nothing. It's his move. Downlink. - Yeah. - Yeah, Jack. Listen, I've had a chance to think it over. Did you? Yes, I did. But we have to get one thing straight. I'm the only man in this universe that can get you out of there alive. There's nobody else. I'm the one to reckon with, Ted. That may be, but in the meantime, you know, we're starving. My buddy is starting to disappear before my eyes. You should see him. You know what we never get in prison? - Pizza. Ain't that right, Shep? - Where's the nearest pizza place? There's one over at Beaumont, 10-15 minutes. It'll take about an hour, Ted. What else? - A helicopter, real big one. - I'll work on it. What else? Let me see. I need 100 rounds of 12-gauge double aught. I guess you know I can't do that. - Even if I was to give you a girl, Jack? - Sorry. Weapons and ammo are deal breakers. Yeah, I hear you, Jack. But if we were to do some horse-trading, which one would you want? Would you want anyone in particular? How about the teacher? I mean, she's so fucking sexy, isn't she? She looks good, she smells good. Hell, if I wasn't so devoted to Priscilla, I'd take a stab at her myself. Hell, if I wasn't so devoted to Priscilla, I'd take a stab at her myself. - Yeah, one of the girls has asthma. - Yeah, no shit. For a deaf kid, she sure makes a racket, I'll tell you that. That means she's coming out, Ted? No, Jack. What it means is I'm going to shoot her in exactly two minutes... if I don't get that ammo. Start timing. Shit. Get up. Sit down, lady. Sit down. Get down on your ass, get your ass down. - Jesus! - He's at the window. - Call it out, Toby. - One minute, 30 seconds. Do something. Tell him you'll give him the shells. - No. - He's going to shoot her. I don't think he will. - Sonny! - Yeah. - Get up here now! - Coming! What? Get this one, take her down to the post and tie her up. - Take her down right now, hurry up. - Come on. Move. One minute. - Send them some blanks. - Maybe some ammo that'll jam the guns? No. - Okay, that's it. I'm going out there. - Hold it, Lenny. You're not going anywhere. He's going to kill her in cold blood. - He's not. - Thirty seconds. How the hell do you know that? Twenty seconds. Fifteen seconds. Ten seconds, nine, eight... Three, two. Zero, that's two minutes. Two minutes, five seconds. Downlink. Thank God. - Yeah. - Hey, Jack. How's it hanging? Fair to middling. How about you? I'm doing just fine, thanks for asking. Here's the deal. I'm going to shoot me one of these kids every hour till the chopper gets here. That's one an hour, every hour, starting at 4:00 p. m. And I'm also gonna need me 100 rounds of ammo... for the Glocks as well. Why, I guess you're not hearing me, Ted. No ammo, period. The food will be there in 40 minutes. When you get it, I get the girl. You owe me this one. You shot one. This one's mine. - You really want her, Jack? - I really want them all, Ted. You're a pistol, that's what you are, Jack. You're one big pistol. All right, I'm going to let you have this little yellow hacker. For the food and for that chopper at 4:00 p. m. That's good, Mr. Potter, that's real good. We can get your helo in 30 minutes. We don't need one, Lenny. We're not letting him go mobile. - He's going to kill them all. - So he says. And you're willing to take that risk? That's my job, Lenny. That's why I'm here, to talk him out of it. - Will you even talk to us? - I have no comment. Are you here to take over the hostage negotiation? I've nothing to say, I'm not here to take over. - Is the governor trying to get Potter fired? - No, it's nothing like that. We are doing the best we can, we're trying very hard. We're being held a mile... Move it! - Let's go! - Come on. Our state police HRT is here, along with the brass. - Did you request them? - No, I did not. I would have told you if I did. Agent Potter. I'm Roland Marks, Assistant Attorney General for the state of New York. And this is State Police Major Tremain. I brought our hostage rescue team with me, Mr. Potter. They would have been here hours ago... but, if you can believe it, we never received any kind of notification... or request for assistance. The governor thought I should get down here and offer our assistance... make sure there are no more communication glitches like that one. Thank you, but that was no glitch, we have the situation under control. But the FBI HRT is in Miami. I know for a fact they can't leave before tonight, at the earliest. - That's true. - He shot a hostage. If he shoots one, he'll shoot the others. That calls for an immediate tactical response, it's standard operating procedure. That's not my judgment in this case. - I notice that you're monitoring the press. - Yes. Do you realize that there's a great deal of public interest... - and sympathy for the deaf children? - I bet there is. Yet, you've ignored every request for a press briefing. Yes, we're very busy here. In fact, if that's all, we're still busy. What? Are you telling us to leave? As you can see, sir, this is a very small space for us all to work in. - Can I see you outside? - Certainly. Are you aware that everything in that shack... and the people are working for the state of New York? And we appreciate the assistance, but this is still a Federal operation. - You're not planning an assault, are you? - No. Have you offered to exchange yourself or other personnel for those children? - Have you asked for volunteers? - No. We understand they've offered to trade the hostages for a helicopter. - They're not getting one. - Well, why not? You could track it on radar with a homing device, they wouldn't get away. It's too risky. There is a known quantity of casualties right now. You just came off a suspension, didn't you? No, I took leave for personal reasons. Everyone has the greatest sympathy about Mrs. Potter. - Including, clearly, the congressmen who... - Look, I don't know you... so don't go mentioning sympathy for my wife. You're free to complain about me to the governor or to Washington... you be my guest. Excuse me. You got it? Light him up. - Lower your face shield and say something. - What should I say? That's fine. Okay, get him dressed. Get as close to the doorway as you can, I want to see what's inside. What kind of weapons they have, radios, portable TVs, whatever. Yes, sir. No problem. You should stand in the doorway... but do not, under any circumstances, go inside. All right, but what if he won't release her unless I do? You just leave the food, walk away. If it's between you and the hostage, you save yourself first. - Well, sir, if I... - That's an order, trooper. Okay, send him out. I'll tell him you're coming. - Hey, Sonny. - Yeah. Sonny, bring down that teacher and that little kid... who makes all of them hacking noises, bring them down right now. Just a second. Hey, Jack... I'm sure you got a wire on that boy, right? - What if I do? - I want you to tell him to stop, right now. Why? I don't want him to get here and think he can snoop around. I know how you fuckers work, I've been barricaded before, man. - I'm a pro. - Stevie, hold it right there. Bring them here. Okay, we've got some food coming. Some food that's outside. You are going to go outside and get the food... You're gonna go home, okay? So, that's the deal. Go get food... I'm just going to have to shoot her. Go. Come on, we're hungry. Let's move it. That'll do it. Come on, all the way. When you come back, I'll be waiting for you. Yeah, love, go. Shit. Get him back. Uplink. Hey, Ted, I'm coming out there. That kid forgot two large pepperonis. Downlink. - Yeah. - I want you to stop right where you are. And I want you to tell that cop-boy of yours to go back to you... 'cause I don't want you getting closer to her than you already are. Stevie, come here. Melanie... I'm John Potter, I'm with the FBI. Can you understand me? Good. I want you to pretend... that you're looking through the pizza boxes, but keep your eyes on me. - Move over there, closer, and go slow. - Yes, sir. Don't block her line of vision to me. Melanie. ...but we can see you signing through the upstairs window. We're trying to get you out, but we need your help, okay? I want to know how the children are. And I want to know about the three men. - Just hurry this shit up, Jack. - Yeah, okay. Little faster, Stevie. Good. I want you to take the pizza and go back. I'm sorry I have to send you back. You be careful. Be careful. - Yes. - Ted. You got your pizza, send out Beverly. You're sure that's the one you want, Jack? You sure you don't want Melanie instead? I can sort of see you looking at her out there. She does have a set on her, doesn't she? - Send the girl out, Ted. - Okay. Bye-bye. Get rid of this kid. Go get her. Okay. What is it? Chief Stillwell saw someone at the south end of the field. - Did he fire? - No, shot came from the building. Sir, look. Shit! - Tell everybody, no return fire. - Yes, sir. - I'm coming up. Stevie, come with me. - Yes, sir. Theodore Handy, I'm Roland Marks! Assistant Attorney General for the state of New York. I want you to let the kids go and take me in their place. We don't want you. Handy, I'm alone and unarmed. He's stepping lively. If he gets any closer, I'm gonna have to shoot him. For the love of God, Handy, let those children go. Marks, this is Potter. Get under cover immediately, or you will be arrested. I'm trying to save them. No, you are endangering them. I want you to give up the kids, Handy, and take me in their place. Do you hear me? I said I don't want you. I swear, that one went right by his ear. There's no reason to shoot me. I'm unarmed. Kissing the worms, man. - I just want to talk to you. - Hey. Hey, Sonny. - Yeah. - Get your ass down here, right now. What you doing, girl? You snooping around here? What? Get your ass down here and get this lady upstairs. Get her now. We have to get him out of there. Stay low, son. I'm trying to help you, you understand that? Get down on the ground, sir. You're interfering with a Federal operation. What the hell are you talking about? You're working for me. And don't you forget it. Handy... if you let the kids come out... I'm prepared to negotiate in good faith. - I'm gonna have to take you in, sir. - Yeah, I'd like to see you try. Sir, my orders are to shoot you in the leg and drag you back. Let's go! Handy, you son of a bitch, I'll see you rot in hell. Crazy old fuck. Let's eat. Never exchange hostages, Marks. The whole point of negotiation is to devalue them. If he'd gotten you, it would have made my job impossible. I don't see why. A hostage like you would have boosted his sense of power... and courage a hundred times. He'd up his demands and stick to them. I don't care about that. What I care about is those hostages. Really? It had nothing to do with those cameras out there? Are you implying that I'd risk my life for some kind of publicity? Unlike you, I happen to care about those women and children. Unlike you, I'm willing to risk my life for them. I'm not the one concerned with rebuilding a shattered reputation. John. Yeah, what's up? There's a detective second on the Pittsburgh PD, a Sharon Foster. She negotiated Handy's surrender in the holdup five years ago. - He gave up to her? - He did, yes. Appears she's pretty good. - Then get her up here. - I thought you might say that. So I connected her through to the 5:00 puddle jumper from Buffalo. The only reason you needed to tell me that now... - was to give me time to rein my temper. - You know me so well. Thanks. Let's get something straight, Marks, and you, too, Major. If either of you interfere with this barricade again... I will arrest you and I'll see the US Attorney makes sure you do time. Then you should consider your own actions... because you could be facing state charges for reckless endangerment. I'll try to live with that. Potter's bluffing. He'd never make that stick. Yeah, you wanna take the chance? So we just stand here and watch them be murdered... not lift a finger? Is that it? No. What we do is, hope to God that Potter knows what he's doing. Excuse me. How is she? They had to give her a shot, but she should be all right. - When will we be able to question her? - She's at the window. The children are okay. They're scared, but they're all right. They took Susan downstairs and tied her up... with the young one, right below us. - The rapist. - Supposedly likes very young children. Susan might be too old for him. They have a gun. Two shotguns and tools. New ones... a hammer and a big monkey wrench. I think I've found a way to escape. There's a broken-down staircase that they're not guarding. I know you can't answer me, or tell me what to do... but I think you would want me to do it. I don't want you to do it. And so I will try. You like some pizza? No? Why? You must be hungry. Have some. Look. Good pizza. I haven't had pizza in about eight-and-a-half months. Want some? Yeah. There you go. Good, huh? It's good stuff. Downlink. - Yeah, hello, Ted. - You know, Jack... it's damn near 4:00 p. m., and I haven't heard nor seen no helicopter. You gotta give us some time. We're having trouble with the bulldozer. What bulldozer? Who the fuck asked for a bulldozer? Come on, Ted, we're both looking out at the same field. Where's the helicopter supposed to land? All that old junk, those old fence posts... we gotta clear an area for 100 feet around. I know you want the helicopter close to the building. You're damn right I do. You see? - What about a pontoon chopper? - A pontoon chopper. - I'd have never thought about that. - You damn well should've thought about it. There's a goddamn river out back here behind the building. - Why, yes, but that's the Niagara River. - Yeah, I know it's the Niagara River, Jack. Good for you. Because I had no idea till I got here. They tell me the water is very fast, the current. Which just stands to reason, we're not that far downriver from Niagara Falls. You might wanna land a helicopter, but you'd be swept downriver right away. You see? That's why we need the bulldozer. Jack? Tell me something, Jack. In Houston, with them fellows, what'd they ask for? They ask for a helicopter, bulldozer? - They wanted a lot of things, Ted. - I know, I mean, we saw it on C-Span... all those fellows in Lewisburg in prison there. We was watching the hearings and... You could hear a goddamn mouse fart when you was on TV. - Did you know that? - No, I didn't. Yeah, you were on the stand for, what, three days? - Three days. - See, I knew that. But, you know, the thing that bothered me, Jack... was they never asked you if you thought that you fucked up. It seemed like a simple question to me... so I'm asking you, did you fuck up? - The investigation concluded... - I don't give a shit about the investigation... that's not what I'm getting at. What I'm getting at is... when that building exploded... did you feel bad? - Yes. - Did it bother you? You lost those people, I mean, those kids in the store... cops, your FBI brothers and that poor fucking retard janitor. Answer the question, Jack. Yes, it bothered me. You see, right there, Jack. We ought to change jobs, man. Because that wouldn't bother me at all. The only thing that bothers me is when I don't keep my promises. That doesn't seem to bother you at all, does it? - Ted, this is a practical situation here. - No, this is the situation. If that bulldozer is not here within a half hour... I promise, I give you my word that I'm gonna kill that little what's-her-name... - that Emily with the little red hair. - Half an hour, that's not... It's half an hour. That's a promise. Can we get a bulldozer here in half an hour? Okay, I'm gonna do something. Okay? I don't want you to be afraid. I'm gonna untie you, just your one hand, all right? See if I can get this. Let's untie it, just like this. See, get some circulation back in there. That feels good, right? Good. Okay, now I'm gonna take your hand. I just want you to relax. Just relax. Okay. There you go. Yeah, like this. How does that feel? Fuck. You gotta go easy, or do you like it rough? Do you like it rough? Yeah, you can pinch it. You can pinch it. Be rough with me, yeah. I like that. I like that. - Hey, Sonny. - Yeah? Everything okay up there? Everything's fine, Ted. I'm telling you, okay? Everything's gonna be fine, okay? We're gonna have some fun now, okay? Just a second here. You'll be a lot more comfortable when I take this off, okay? Just a second. Wait. Okay. Here we go. Look, yeah, just relax. Fuck. Jesus. Get off me! Hey, get off. Get off. What are you doing? Hold that one, will you? What the fuck. - What, did you kill her? - No, she's just knocked out. It's that bitch's fault there. She tried to jump me. Bring her here. Hey, you squirrelly woman. Here's what you're gonna do. You're gonna stay the fuck upstairs and you're gonna watch these kids... and you're gonna keep these kids quiet. And if you don't do that, I'm gonna let Sonny... pick one of them little canary birds and do with her what he wants. You understand? Shep! I know, just take these kids upstairs. Get ready, sister. Remember a couple of months ago what the Calo brothers did to Joey? Yeah. Remember that... if it weren't for me, they would have done the same thing for you? Yeah, and I owe you. I was just having fun, that's all. I'll tell you something, right now, Sundance. I'm in a death-defying line of work, you understand? And all I need is obedience. I need people that I can trust to do what I tell them to do. You can trust me. I just thought you meant... You know something, if you fuck up again I'm gonna have to kill you. - I'm not gonna fuck up. - I'm gonna have to kill you. Okay. Great job. Nice timing. We got one of our people who can drive this thing? - You're looking at him. - You're kidding. Do you want me to take my time going real slow making this patch? No, you can go as fast as you like. But before you go out there... drain out half the water and three-quarters of the oil. You know how much an engine on one of these things costs? $75,000. - Now, ask me if I care. - Sir, she's at the window. - Now, ask me if I care. - Sir, she's at the window. I'm going to take the children there. She's found a tunnel that leads to a river... and she's gonna take the children there. She's talking to the kids now. I need you to get their attention at the window for five minutes. We'll start when we see you start. We'll go, okay? But hurry. Here. So must it be about there. - Do we have our Zodiac boats on the river? - Yes, sir. Can we get somebody to take these plans there? I can do it, sir. Oh, and Lenny, warm up your bulldozer, you're on. Yes, sir. Just one moment. You're not gonna let them risk it? I don't think I can stop them. I'm not sure I would if I could. But they could get killed. They could get killed anyway. Look, Mrs. Stanley, I'm sorry if that sounded callous... but a situation like this, you have to think of the hostages as already dead. That way, if we save some, we celebrate. Get him. Uplink. Yeah. Got good news, Ted. Got me my chopper? Close, the bulldozer's here. Ted, look at that. This guy's so slow. Start the engine. Go through this side. It's overheating pretty bad. Good, now really gun it. There goes $75,000. Look at that shit. Come on, Ted, you have to be reasonable. How can we foresee something like that happening? What the fuck is that? Jack, I'll get back to you. That. That's some kind of engine noise. Sonny, check on those kids. Fuck! Shit! Ted! I was watching them every second, I swear! I don't know what the hell happened! I got it. Here we go. We'll be back. Zodiac 1 to Zodiac 2, move in. Watch it. Okay, let's go. Two out. Go! Melanie and the big girl, Susan. They didn't make it. They got them. Shit! Shep, let's go! Hang on! Shots have been fired, a boat is over. It's Stevie and one of the hostages. Get out, you're blocked on both sides! We can't risk it, not with the kid! Pull out! Too dangerous to pursue while the kids are in the boat. Are there any more boats downstream? Over. We have them in sight, they're okay. Chief Stillwell sent me to pick up Det. Foster. Welcome, I'm Lenny Budd and this is Agent Potter. John Potter. Sharon Foster. I understand you're in a situation... - with an old friend of mine. - The situation's very fluid right now. Stand by, we're gonna need your help. Get in here. What's that now? - What is that? - A lamp. Yeah, now, you are a bit of a moron, but I want you to try to envision something. This fucking lamp falls over, the flame goes up them stairs... and the little kids burn like fucking toast... and if the goons were to rush us, all you had to do was stand here, right? - Ted, I was. - You were standing here? The whole time? Turn around. - You see me, man? - Yeah, I see you. You know some other way to get down here from up there? - Answer him. - No. Well, then, you tell me, man. You tell me. Well, then, you tell me, man. You tell me. How're they gonna get down here from up there without you seeing them? Look at them and look at you, they're smaller. Right? Shep, take the girls down and tie them up. Take them downstairs right now, will you? Don't... Shut up. Just shut up and listen to me. Okay, sorry. Now, was you standing there the whole time, Sonny? I had to take a piss. All right, where did you piss? I went over there. That corner? How come you didn't piss in this corner? I thought of that... and then I thought, no, I'd probably stink up the place. What... Come on. That's twice today, isn't it? Twice today, what? - Twice your little dick got us into trouble. - Come on. No, don't. Come on, I'll do anything. I'm begging you. Don't. Fuck! That's gotta hurt. Sir, a couple of our snipers report hearing a gunshot. - Outside? - Definitely inside. Muffled. - One single shot? - That's right. - Melanie? - Maybe, if he's angry enough... to give up even more leverage. - You want me to get him? - No. I'm not gonna talk to him anymore, we'll use Det. Foster. - I'm ready, sir. - Not now. He's got to call us. All right, we'll make no moves at all. No activity anywhere that he can see... and we initiate no conversations, period. We wait him out. Sir, he can wait a long time. So can I. This far upstate, we just don't see men like that. Unfortunately, we do in Pittsburgh. This very one, in fact. How the hell did you get him to surrender? I just kept him on the phone long enough, I guess. No concessions, rewards? I promised I'd fuck him. That one I haven't tried. They did escape from a federal institution, however the murders were committed... Marks. Thank God. I started to think you'd... No. Don't worry about that. I'm staying close. Fuck this. Downlink! No. I hope you're happy, Jack. 'Cause you sure made your point. It's not Mr. Potter, Ted. It's Sharon Foster. Remember me? Yeah, of course I do, darling. You still owe me a piece of ass. What are you doing here? I'm just passing by, heard you were up to your old tricks. Not me, I was just up all night... and twiddling my thumbs and biding my time. So, what's shaking? I'm still with the PD, got promoted. I'm a detective second now. No shit. Yeah, I'm doing something with my life. What are you doing with yours? I'm very proud of my accomplishments, actually. You ought to be... cause you're a grade-A fuckup. Listen to you, girl. You've been hanging around too many cops, I'd say. Let's talk, Ted. Sure, I'll talk. Make it quick. Gotta make a deal with Potter for that chopper. I wouldn't make any book on that... if I were you. Why's that? You have no chips left. For one thing, you're missing six hostages, or didn't you notice? Yeah, I know that. But I still got the two ladies over there sleeping, tied up. Who cares? Yeah, but it's not the same. You see, when you had the kids, you had real juice. But now with a couple grown women... I don't know, Ted. What I'm trying to say is if things heat up... they could get expendable real quick. Fuck off. Let me talk to Potter right now. He's not here. Just go and fucking find him, then. If I don't get that chopper here in 10 minutes... I'm gonna shoot myself a couple of ladies dead. That's fucking brilliant, you must've thought that one through. You dumb fucking asshole, if you kill those ladies... these guys will lay a shit storm on you so fast, you won't know what hit you. You better face it, even if you got the chopper... they'll drag you back and stick a needle in your vein. Now, how does that sound? That's something to look forward to, isn't it, baby? Yeah. I don't want no needle. That never has to happen, Ted. My ass. Now, you listen to me... I'm telling you the truth. You make a deal now or you'll die today. Hold on a second. Now what? Who could guarantee the State won't seek the death penalty? I suppose Marks could. - Where is he? - He's outside. Spent the night in the media tent, after having his picture taken with the kids. - That figures. Get him in here. - Right. I think we may be able to work something out here. Listen, baby... while they're checking, why don't you come in here and sit on my dick? I would, Ted, you know I would. But I don't know where it's been. My dick? It's been in my pants for an awful long time, unfortunately. You just keep it there just a little while longer. He's gonna surrender? I think we can get him to, if you'll put it on paper. Of course I will. I have the State Assistant Attorney General here. He's guaranteeing they won't seek the death penalty... if you surrender. Now, do we have a deal? No, we don't got a deal. I wanna see it all writ out first. You will, we're gonna send it to you right now. And, Ted, you're doing the right thing. - Yeah. - Ted? Hang on. - Hello. - So what do you think, Ted? It's fine, except I don't see no mention about my man, Shep Wilcox. It's fine, except I don't see no mention about my man, Shep Wilcox. - He's a part of this. - Absolutely, same deal. Bonner, too. You can forget about him. He's not gonna be needing no paper. Why is that? Poor little fellow went and had himself an accident. That little redhead we got in here, she went and bit his dick off. Mr. Potter just walked in. He wants to talk to you. Hey, Ted, I just heard the news. You're doing the right thing. Save the bullshit, will you, Jack? What's the game plan now? Just a few ground rules. When I tell you, put down your weapons... step outside with your hands out to your side, not on your head. It's like Christ on the cross. It's a very nice image, isn't it? How fitting. Listen, here's the deal. I want to see you. I want you up front. I want to know where you are. That's the only way we're coming out. I'll be there, five minutes. Sir, in case we get busy later, I want to say... it was a privilege working with you. Likewise. You did a great job with him. - It was all you, sir. I just carried the mail. - Nevertheless, great job. Thank you. Time's up, Ted. Where are you, Jack? I can't see you. Right here, Ted. Come on out. Now stretch your arms out. Stretch your arms out, now! Do it. Okay, Jack, take it easy. You're gonna have a fucking heart attack. Step forward, five feet. On your face, do it. - On your face, now! - All right, man, you're the boss. Hey, Jack. What, not even gonna say hi to me? Hello, sweet cheeks, I've been waiting for you. How about that fuck now, baby? You look terrific. The building is clear, sir. Let's get you home. Capt. Budd, this is Kelly at Airport Security. We found a body in the ladies' room broom closet, sir. Could you get here right away? Kelly, calm down, now. You and Harris preserve the crime scene. - I'll get down there as quick as I can. - Yes, sir. No, it's the least I can do for you fellows for giving me a ride. I hate those uniforms. - Cream? - Yes, in both, thanks. - Sugar? - Yeah. Great. Watch your step, honey. - She's a trip. - Yeah. Hi. Can I borrow that towel, please? - That towel? - Yeah. Thank you. Hey, look, man. Looks like your wish has come true, man. Check it out. My wish. - Baby. - Morning, fellows. Shep. Take the keys, hands first. - I did miss you. - Easy. - Let's go. - Hands. This one down there. I'm driving. Move over. Get the way over, sweet cheeks, attagirl. Shit. Jesus Christ! When was the body found? It's about 15 minutes ago, sir. Harris is in there with the body right now. Sit down, son. Put your head between your knees. Thank you, sir. Looks to me like she got her neck broken. Second stage rigor's set in. It's room temperature. She's been dead about 12 hours. She must have been locked in the broom closet all night. - You didn't touch anything, I hope. - No, sir. Would you all give us some room here now? Everybody outside the door until the crime lab gets here. What is it? You look as sick as young Kelly out there. That's a cop. You see that? Right there? You have the same worn spot on your belt. Made by a handcuff case. We've been had, Lenny. Who knew that Sharon Foster was coming into this airport yesterday? Just our people, people on the command check. One of them tipped off Handy's girlfriend... that Foster was coming. - Excuse me, Handy's girlfriend? - Yeah. What's her name, Pris Gunder? The one that got away after the bank robbery? Now, only a very close friend of Handy's... can get away with pretending to be Sharon Foster. So, you're saying... That that is the body of the real Sharon Foster. - I find that hard to believe. - So do I, but look. God, you're right. - Christ. - What? Sharon Foster. Damn! Pris Gunder, she wanted to get a ride back to Pittsburgh. She hitched a ride on the perp truck going to Lewisburg. Shit. And both officers are down? Yes, sir, one's dead and the other one ain't far from it. There was a woman with them. There is a woman down inside, but she works here. No other woman. All right. We'll be there as soon as we take Melanie home. We don't have time, Lenny. We got to get back to that slaughterhouse where the money is. - What's that? - The money's in the slaughterhouse. What money? The $2,200,000 from the bank robbery in Pittsburgh. That's where they were headed yesterday morning when they hit that Cadillac. - But my man chased them in there. - No, he didn't, Lenny, he followed them. - Yeah, they're here. Get them moving. - And no sirens. Everyone remains in the staging area until I call them forward. - You hear that? - Roger. Good. Get on it. Wait here. Lock the doors. You'll be safe in the car. The troopers are on their way. It sure is a good thing I like you, 'cause I could plug you so easy... Bullshit. Your share is your share. Man, you're a tough bargainer, huh? You know, it's like this all the time. I'm getting dirty for you. You're all down there, prissy in your nice little suit. Hey, I gave you a simple job. The whole thing was laid out for you. You turned it into a goddamn bloodbath. - Did I ask to get caught? - You practically did. What the hell were you doing anyway, coming here? Hey, Pris, come on in here and listen to this, honey. You're hearing all this shit, Pris? Pris, I'm telling you, Marks said I screwed up. When have I ever screwed up, honey? Pris, just answer me, baby. Where are you? What are you doing? Hey, Pris, this fucker is gonna shoot me. She's as tired of cleaning up after you as I am. Pris, honey! Don't move, Marks. Put the gun down. Forgetting something? You were gonna let Marks shoot me in cold blood, Pris. He said that you're tired of cleaning up after my shit. Baby, you don't believe that, do you? Yeah, baby, I do. I do. Truth be told, I do. Come on! Fucking stupid bitch. You took the keys and I need them. Now you're gonna die. - Freeze! - Oh, man. "I go with you. " You want to go with me? Please do. I owe you a martini.
