On the way to School On the way from school Graduation will soon arrive. Sanae, you are going, aren't you? - Where to? - The party. No, the trip. With Kawahara sensei. I see. Yes, I'll go. Where should we go? Hakone or lzu? Well, I don't know. Such matters are up to Mari-bo. - Mari-bo. - What? - Bad mouthing me again? - Don't be like that. You are organising the thank you trip. OK. But you must pay for it. - Do you all agree? - Yes. The thank-you-trip for Kawahara sensei. Good. I heard that Kawahara sensei will return to her home town after our graduation. To get married? At the end of last year she lost her mother. Her father is living alone, so... But, marriage is also possible. Omie, what is marriage like? Mariko, just look at your face. Mountain and blue sky. How about a photo as a souvenir? Sensei, let's take one. This way please. Beautiful, Mt. Fuji. Historic landmark Hakone no seki (checkpoint) Now, please. One more. Will you come closer to sensei? No good! This is my first try. I'm a beginner too. No, you can't hit the red ball. Why not? I don't know why, but you can't. OK. Then... Move, quick. Poor thinking is the same as sleeping. Shut up. The rise and fall of the empire is in this stone. Listen, between us you can call me Shizue-san, but not in front of people. I'm embarrassed. Can I? Gee. Then what can I call you? Just say "oi!" or something. Calling me Shizue-san is showing we're newly-weds. I'd be embarrassed. Try now, sir. Oi. Is that OK? Yes, dear. Hot news! A newly-wed couple. Marumage hair style. What happened? I was annoyed by the hot couple. "Between us you can call me Shizue- san, but not in front of people." Look, they are coming. What? A tickling feeling. Your mind is going straight to marriage? Why should we hurry to get married? I agree. I don't want to spend a life in worthless marriage. Better not to marry at all. But to a woman, marriage is... No, I insist. I understand Taeko's opinion, but suppose after a couple of years, all others get married except you. - Then, you won't be so cool. - That's your opinion. I can be cool. Only for a year or so, can I enjoy the spring of life. You know an old maid? My aunt. She looks so lonely that it makes me sad. Sensei, where have you been? I just met a friend. Sensei, please. What's the matter? You are so quiet. Oh no, sensei. We have a serious conversation once in a while. You will be madam soon. Won't you? Time flies. When I started my work as teacher and took charge of you, you were in the third grade. Third, fourth and fifth. It feels like yesterday or the day before yesterday. But, soon we'll all be parted. It makes me feel sad. But you will leave off your uniforms and start a whole new life in the world. Even if you are apart, please keep in touch with each other as you do now. You have different circumstances or family backgrounds, you will step out in many different ways. Nevertheless, having classmates is a thing to be proud of. You can always help each other. I will return to my home town where my father lives alone. But I will never forget you. If you have something that you can't discuss with your parents visit sensei any time. I will help you if possible. Tanaka-san, have you decided what to do? - Yes, a field trip. - Field trip? Watching the world as well as preparing for marriage. I am going to get a job. Good idea. lshii-san, you are going to music school. How about Morita-san? Me, I will go to Kyoto. Kyoto? Good. Your fianc√© is waiting for you in the old city. No, it's not like that. You don't need to hide it. But I wonder where we'll be in five years. Omie, you are in the spotlight on stage in front of lots of spectators. I pray for you. Sensei. If it should happen, I will dedicate everything to my art. Then I will encourage you with all my brothers. Do your best. Then, Sanae is walking along Kamogawa river, holding a cute little baby. Stop it. Don't be so sentimental. I feel cold. Why don't we take a bath? Before that, for the success of Omie's art, we must listen to her music. Good. - This is the people's consensus. - No, it's not. Whatever. Do it. Sensei? Alright. Play the piano, lshii-san, we'll all sing together. - Good. - Oh, no. Look. The prince. Who is he? I've often met him at the station on the way from school. - A prince? - Yes, a noble prince. Sanae, it's suspicious. The prince looked at you. You are suspicious, Omie. Have you met him secretly? Stop kidding. Whatever. You never talked about him at all. He looked at me. Don't you know? What are you talking about? About studying... Only two weeks to go before the exam. Don't worry. I'm with you. Study together. The feet of perpendicular D, E, F are in line. See? - Mari-bo, do you understand? - Yeah. Say it. Perpendicular DEF which were drawn down from a point P, which is on circumscribed circle of Triangle ABC, to each side... You forgot "feet". The feet of perpendicular D, E, F are in line. Feet, feet of perpendiculars. Who thought out such a thing? Simson. Simson sensei. Omie, what time is it? It's early. Still only 4:30. Here you are. Thank you as always. You don't visit as often as before. Now that Mie is with you she looks much happier. I can see it very well. When she was with bad friends she'd be in a bad mood for ages. Enough, mother. Stop it. But maybe we aren't good friends. We'll do it. As I've told you many times before, she is the best on piano. Genius? It's not "so-called". On my responsibility I ask you to support her. If she's good, then yes. If I listen once then I'll see. If she's good, I can talk the baron into supporting her for three or four years in Vienna or Milan. The baron's support will be a promise of success as a musician. No, it's not. It all depends on her talent. The baron simply doesn't want to end her talent without a chance. Hello. We met in Hakone a few days ago. You were in group. A picnic? We'll graduate soon, so we invited our teacher on the trip. Oh, you'll graduate. Then, maybe we'll not meet on the train anymore. Good-bye and good luck. Suspicious. What? Sanae's prince. This is Mr. Ariga. How do you do? Hashimoto sensei is taking care of Mieko's study. I am Mieko's mother, sir. I've heard a lot about you from sensei. This is Mieko. I am Mieko, sir. I am Ariga. Well, I never. It's a surprise, really. You know each other? We know and we don't. Which is it, Mieko-san? Well... I was told that you want to live for music. I am involved in the business. Maybe I can help you. Let me listen. I'm not good enough, sir. In the world of art, modesty and shyness are not allowed. You need confidence. - Could you listen to the end? - Of course. Sensei, what should I play? Well... Please. This one. Ise Monogatari This part? My hunch. - What do I do? - You didn't study this part? Teach me. Thank you for yesterday. We stayed a long time. After we left something happened. On the way back. - Something upset you? - We bumped into the prince. He only talked to Sanae. - You met him? - There's no hope for me. He only seems interested in Sanae. Is he? Good. Omie, if you came out with us you could meet him. - My hunch is correct! - Be quiet. History - I don't know. - It's not fair. Sensei, if you ask us such old things, we can't write anything. Yes. Geometry Sensei, can I borrow an eraser from Takahashi-san? English You sound really confident. Not at all. But Hara sensei will give us pass marks no matter how bad our results are. Only to Omie. - No kidding. - I'm jealous. Physics Tanaka-san, are you giving up so soon? Why don't you try some more? You have still time. But all the questions are out of my reach. Chinese classics Baron, pardon me for leaving first, sir. Fine. What should we do about it? The girl pianist you recommended? I'd like to listen too. I'm planning to organise it after the trip. I see. Good Excuse me, sir. Ogura Music institute Goodbye. Hello. We meet again. I expected to see you today too. I've been waiting for you. I've waited for you every day. I'm a delinquent. Then I'm a delinquent too. Sometimes I intentionally missed my trains, expecting to see you. Do you agree with my story to avoid me feeling embarrassed? - Not at all. - So it's true what you said? A lie. Sanae-san, what are you going to do after you graduate? I have to go to Kyoto. Kyoto? You'll be married soon. No, there's another reason. A family reason? Do you want to hear? Yes, please. No, I won't. It's pointless. Please, tell me. Sanae-san, I'm sorry if it sounds rude but... do you feel that you are loved by someone? If I... If you'll allow me, I want to live with you for the rest of my life. - Are you angry? - No. Don't say that. I teased Omie about Hara sensei. The exam is over. Only graduation awaits us. Ariga-san is a good person He said he wanted to be with me. After graduation, After graduation, My life will... Sanae-san, father is calling you. I got a letter from Yamazaki-san in Kyoto. They want to hold the wedding as soon as you graduate. Will you really marry Sanae off to a man confined to bed with spinal TB? It's already been decided. Like Florence Nightingale, it's a noble thing for a woman to dedicate her life to a suffering individual. You understand that. Do you see? Do you understand? Miss, your friends are visiting. Welcome. Hello. Good news. Can you guess? Has your family accepted your wish to devote yourself to music? Maybe with support she can go to Vienna. - Omie, congratulations. - Thank you. Mari-bo is successful too. She got a job at Yokohama, at a trading house. Salary is 40-yen. Not much, but I can observe the world from the window. Good. I envy you. It's the luckiest thing to live by doing what you want. Sanae is sentimental. You have a right to a married woman's hairstyle. Don't say that. Now, confess. What does your husband do in Kyoto? Literary type or sportsman? Stop it. What's the matter? Nothing. - Come on in. - We came to ask you out. Taeko and the others are waiting in Ginza. Change your kimono. Well, not today. - Are you busy? - Come anyway. Family business and snowless ski slopes are both boring, I know. But I can't. What a shame. Our group is going to hold a party for Omie. I alone... I alone cannot... What's the matter? Why are you crying? Mother, must I go to Kyoto? And must I serve a sick husband for life? Like Mariko-san, please allow me to work? I will work hard. My friends are all given a chance to do what they want. I'm not selfish. I wouldn't complain for anything. Please, mother. Please. But her friends are enjoying their lives as you see. She alone... I pity her. You're being unreasonable. Yamazaki-san paid her education costs for five years. In addition, he supported this shop after the earthquake damage. I promised her for his son after she graduated school. How could I go back on my promise now. Think about my position. I clearly said yes when he asked. I was sold. Even though it is spring, Graduation day Did you see her? How bold she is. Usually she is so modest. I wonder why. What? Don't be surprised. With high heels and dress. - Who? - Morita-san. It's surprising. A gay dress! - How dare you wear this? - Am I wrong? This is absolutely outside school rules. Are you going to attend the graduation ceremony like that? Will I be scolded? You are disgusting. This is not such a simple matter. But if I'll be scolded alone, well then? It's none of your business. Keeping the school rules is our duty and the responsibility for all. You are selfish. Don't take it so seriously. It's no big deal. - Don't get so excited. - It is a big deal. You've quite upset me. It's not just the dress but your attitude. Disgusting. Disgusting? What is? If you wanted to wear such a dress, why didn't you do it before? But on graduation day, you've really upset me. Your character is mean. Narrow-minded. I don't like it. Do you think so? I came to school like this today because it's the last day. All right. I see. I didn't know you were such a person. The past five years have not been a short period in your life. During this period, through summer and winter, we have been educating you like parent birds caring for their chicks. Today we send you out into the world. This is the happiest moment for me and all the other teachers. You are females who will supposedly be good wives and mothers. I believe in your purest hearts as you are now. However, laxity of spirit is a deplorable thing. Do not forget your current spirit, and do not be infected with vice in the world. It is said that the life of a woman is a history of love. With everlasting love, be a good wife and a good mother. That is the pride that women possess. Women have no form of happiness other than that. What's the matter, Morita-san? Do you feel sick? I'm sorry. I suddenly feel so sad. Come. Rest in the medical room. What's the matter? Morita-san. What is this? I'm sorry. Why are you so upset? I came looking like this. I know I broke the school rules. I've done wrong. Listening to headmaster's speech I became sad and scared. Morita-san... To tell you the truth, I was frightened by your appearance. You have always been so modest. I felt sad too. But you needn't cry anymore. If you regret it, you are a good person. Stop this crying. Are you alright? Now you can attend the ceremony. Omie forgive me. The reason I behaved joyfully with this appearance, it was my way of saying farewell. Farewell to my dreams and hopes. Going to Kyoto means, I've been sold. For money and giri obligation. I will be a nominal wife for a man who is confined to bed by illness. This appearance by breaking school rules is a farewell to my lost youth. I want to be a Trappist or cut my hair to be a nun if possible. That's so much better. Sanae, I'm sorry. I didn't know. I'm so sorry. I said terrible things to you. Omie. I know, I know now. How hard it is. Light of fireflies, snow by the window Many suns and moons spent reading Years have gone by without notice Day has dawned; on this morning, we part. Stay or leave, it doesn‚Äôt matter Hold my memories, in so many corners of my heart; In one breath, while we are happy, sing. Sanae's diary My five years are ended today. I cried and collapsed in the medical room, where I heard Hotaru-no-Hikari. I met Ariga-san. I am attracted by him each time we meet. By an impulse I was about to confess my situation and ask for help. Days quickly elapse, soon I will never meet him again. I cried "Ariga-san". Then I awoke. I am embarrassed to think of him even in dream. I wrote about it, but this diary is my secret. When I die I will hold this diary to my breast. To dedicate oneself to a sick person my whole life is pure life. But I need a bright world. If I protest to my parents by demanding a bright world, am I a bad daughter? You must be strong. Before being a daughter, we must think we are women first. Against our parents? I think they will understand, if you ask them with all your heart. And if that doesn't work? If I ask them with all my heart but it doesn't work, what do I do next? Then you must be determined. Find a job, support yourself and go for what you believe in. Is it OK, it is isn't it? First of all, you must ask with your whole heart. Consider carefully. After that step, I will help you as much as possible. Did you call me? Buy a couple of hempen cords. Some Club toothpaste, two. Where is Sanae? She's going out with her friend. Spending time walking around. What a bad girl. Where have you been? Tomorrow Yamazaki-san arrives to receive you. Mother is working alone. You must get ready. Mie-san, Sanae-san is visiting you. What? Sanae? Enjoy yourself. Omie. I know. There's no need to tell. You've left home. Great. Good decision. - Aren't I burden on you? - We are friends, not strangers. Stay at my house for a while. If you like I can talk to your father. Thank you. Don't cry. When you cry, I want to cry too. I'll play the piano to cheer you up. Oh, yes, I have something to tell you. What? I'm going to Vienna. Is it final? When? This autumn, at the soonest. There's something strange about it. That prince. He's called Ariga-san. My going to Vienna is down to his efforts. Probably when I go there Ariga-san will escort me. With Ariga-san? He's travelling to north China with Baron Ogura. Really? He's a good person. Are you going to marry him? Marry him? No, it's not possible. But I am confident he doesn't dislike me at least. If it's possible? Well... Happy? Yes. Mother must be happy too. I'm sure. You will be pleased for me too, Sanae? Sure. I will be pleased if you're happy. What's the matter? - What is it? - Nothing. Nothing at all. I'll go back home. Back home? Are you going to Kyoto after all? That's outrageous. I have no other... No choice, is that it? Why are you so weak-willed? It's for the best. Goodbye. Sanae! The rain continued two, three days The heart of Sanae is rainy too Why don't you come to sensei? You promised that you'd come to me whenever you were suffering. Ariga-kun. Very good. Promising talent. - I'm willing to support her. - Thank you, sir. Please. - Good. - Very good. I have to say, congratulations. What? - It's decided, isn't it? - What? Come on. Your wedding. When is it? - I don't know. - Tell me when. I'll play the wedding march for you. It's funny isn't it. Anti-marriage Taeko will get married before any of us. How unpredictable. Unlike in maths, two plus two doesn't always equal four in this world. - That's the way of the world. - I see. Taeko always got C in maths. This time you got A plus, that's obvious. Stop teasing me. Omie too, you are doing well with the prince. Not at all. You are. I think you are. No. Your refusal makes us more suspicious. - Omie, is it true? - No, no. "Though I try to hide it, my deep love shows in the blush on my face" You have done well. Baron Ogura was very pleased. I owe you everything. Your friends joined in. Yes, friends are so good. We can share joy and sorrow. They are pleased for me and cry with me. Yes that's true.. - Didn't you invite her? - Who? - The lady who is going to Kyoto? - Sanae-san? I wanted to see her. You knew then, that Sanae-san is going Kyoto. Have you heard it from someone? Have you met Sanae-san somewhere? Are you accusing me? Do you think it's wrong of me to meet Sanae-san? I didn't mean that. Why does she have to go to Kyoto? She has a fianc√©. Is that true? You are shocked. I can see. Lie. It's a lie. Sanae-san didn't go Kyoto. Where is she now? Where? Are you going to visit her? You are cruel to ask me that. - You're back early. - Today's a flag day, ceremony only. Kawahara-san, you've got a letter, sir. Thank you. Mariko c/o Kawahara Farm To Morita Sanae-sama Sanae-san. You've got a letter. Mie's concert was superb. For the first time our group met together since graduation. We missed you so much. Mie will go to Vienna soon. Taeko who was so anti-marriage got married. I'm working full time in an office. How is your life? A visitor from Tokyo. - A woman? - No, a gentleman. I clearly told Yamazaki-san in Kyoto, that I would give him my daughter. If these were the old days I would have to cut my belly to excuse my giri obligation. So, are you going to take Sanae-san back? You are thinking of yourself alone. You are thinking only of your giri. Surely the Yamazaki-san have money. But the would-be husband is confined to bed with spinal TB. If you give Sanae-san to the family, it's such a shame for her. The emotion of young girl is so delicate and complicated. If money buys happiness, the world would be an easier place. Please think of Sanae-san's happiness. Sensei, I didn't come here to take Sanae back. Sanae is my dearest daughter. Who would want her to marry an invalid? To tell you the truth, I was secretly pleased when Sanae ran away. If I declare I disown my daughter, it could be an excuse to Yamazaki-san. So you'll allow Sanae-san to stay here? I'm asking you to keep her for a while. So I visited you. She left home with nothing, maybe it's not easy for her. I brought her spare clothes and this isn't much, but it's part of her allowance. Please take care of her, ma'am. Sanae is my only daughter. She ran away from home and I cut all ties with her, but I've been worried the whole time Please, take good care of her. I understand your heart, sir. I am sorry for my unnecessary talking. I'll call Sanae-san. No. I won't see her. But... If I see her I would want to give her a kind word. And that goes against giri to Yamazaki-san. Maybe sensei thinks it funny, but to an old-fashioned man, breaking giri is the most unbearable thing. I understand, sir. She is of marriageable age already. If she loves someone and the man is acceptable to sensei, please let her marry anytime. And when the times calm down, tell her "don't worry about the past and come back openly". I will be willing to receive my daughter. Did you hear what your father said? Father? He left. He left? Father! Father! Could you tell me where the house of Kawahara sensei is? First on the left. Thank you. What for? By any chance No, it's not possible. Here you are. I've been looking for you. Ariga-san is visiting. I heard the details. Sanae-san, what should I tell him? Ariga-san wants to marry you. What should I tell him? Sanae-san. Sensei, you know why I was wandering in the rain for days. Yes, I know. But Ariga-san wants you. No, it's not true. Ariga-san has Mie-san. I'm worthless. Worthless. No. Sensei, don't make me suffer anymore. Did she really say she didn't want to. Where is Sanae-san? I'd like to see her. Even if it is true, I want to hear it from her herself. I can't give up before that. I understand, but... she doesn't want to see you. I can't see her? I'm sorry. Give me one. You are strong. Go away. Welcome, sir. There. I've found you. - I've been looking for you for ages. - How can I help you? Nothing in particular. But you are out every night. - I'm worried. - If it's nothing, please go back. I have something. I need a drink. Give me one. You won't? - I'll take one myself. - Stop it. Your trip is soon. Take care of yourself. Trip? I don't care one little bit. I'm going to cancel going to Vienna. Mie-san, what are you talking about? Please be quiet, sensei. Why can't I have a drink? I know very well why you are drinking. For the same reason as you, I want to drink. Why can't I? Really, I was stupid. I expected that I could marry you. It's a stupid thing. Like picking up money in a dream. Young pianist attempts suicide before foreign trip Young pianist who attempted suicide Where is she? Dead? Wandering? Mysteriously disappeared? Late Autumn in the highlands Walking, wondering, alone Are you getting up again? You must lie down. I feel fine today. No. You'll get a fever by evening. Come. - I'm back. - Welcome. How are you, sis? Thank you. I feel fine today. I'll go and make supper. Stay with sis. Are these all your friends? All my close friends. This picture was taken in Hakone, just before we graduated. She's beautiful. She is my best friend. Is she? Where is she now? She is with this teacher now. What's she doing? Is she a teacher? No. Teru-chan, - Do you know "Hotaru-no-hikari"? - Yes, I can sing it. Will you sing it for me? No. Why not? Not alone. I can sing it with you. Then, I'll sing too. Alright. One, two, three. What's the matter, sis? Nothing. Nothing. I just felt sad. Please continue. Laying my body down on a sickbed in a quiet room, a cold wind is raging in my heart, day and night. I abandoned all hope, cut all ties, and then came to this world. Why am I so lonely? Why I am so sad? The daily calendar shows the rest of my life. How many days have I left? Sanae, I want to see you again. But maybe it's hopeless. Sanae... if I die now, please keep Mie somewhere, somewhere in your heart forever. Call anyone she wants, before it's too late. I will visit again later. See the doctor out. Oba-san, what time is it? 3:30. It's time. Can I keep my life? Don't say such a depressing thing. Your teacher and friend will soon come. They sent you a telegram. Now, cheer up. I want to stay alive until Sanae arrives. Oba-san, what time is it? Five o'clock. Five. It's coming soon. It's getting so dark. Turn on the light. I want to see her. It hurts. Hasn't... hasn't she come yet? Mie-san, here they are. They're here. Ishii-san, Omie. It's me. Can you see? Sanae. Sanae. See? Sensei is here too. Sensei. You must be strong. Alright? Now I remember the happy times at school. Sanae. Remember? The happy Hakone trip, the sad graduation. Happiest of all was when we knew nothing and were so innocent. And now... I'm going to die, dreaming of school. No. Hold on. I feel easy now. Listen. I can hear Hotaru-no-hikari somewhere. Yes. I can hear it clearly. Omie, Omie. Why? Why does such a good person have to die? I want to accuse Heaven. It is less than one year since you all graduated from school. Subtitles: Maya Grohn corvusalbus edit
