Round about the cauldron go, in the poisoned entrails throw. Sweltered venom, sleeping got, boil it first in charmed pot. Double double toil and trouble. Fire burn and cauldron bubble. He's here. Olivia. He's here, sweetheart. Oh wait, one sec. You okay? Yeah. Here we go. Like he'll notice. - You ready? - Mmhmm. Oh sweetie, don't forget to breathe! Oh! - You look beautiful. - Thank you. Breathe. Oh! Oh you promised me this is the last time, sweetheart. An addict's promise ain't worth shit. You know that. Oh, come on. Hi. Mike, right? Yes. I've got to go. Check in soon. Like we said on the phone, don't let him out of your sight. These first few days can be very delicate. Don't give him any money. Make sure he shows up for the I.O.P. Oh, okay. Okay. It'll be great. Oh, thank you. Thanks for everything. Thank you, Mike. - We'll see you again, right? - Absolutely. - Thank you, bud. - Of course. Okay. Okay. Come on. Okay, okay, okay. Oh my god, you look so good. Pop. You know, I think he would have liked my last album. Oh, he would have loved them all. We got our son back, Raffy. Yeah. I don't know. I don't think he's, uh, listening from up there. I think it's kind of a, eh, Pops how's the party going down there? Ah. So I, uh... she's pregnant. What? You don't like it. No I... It's, it's beautiful. It's gorgeous. I know what I'm doing, Mom. I am thrilled, for both of you. I thought they canceled the tour. Hmm? They did. What's that? Curtis. That's a full page ad. It costs a lot of money. I don't know. Well, is there something in your contract - obligating you to do the... - No, no. It's fine. Don't worry about it. I'll take care of it, okay? Don't worry. Where are you going with my crossword puzzle? Oh! Watch out. Hey. Yeah, hi. I want it. I want it. I want it really bad. Really, really bad. Oh, Curtis. Honestly. You got to smoke? Use an ash tray, please. One vice at a time, Mom. One vice at a time. ...not if you screw up this Goddamn audition. I'm sorry you had to see that. Don't apologize to me. Apologize to your guitar. And you may have hurt an old friend. Benny's not my friend. Okay? He's my manager. He's always just been my manager. Since when? What? And Ronin? You're screaming at... Baby, what happened in there? I don't think I can... I can't go back in that world right now. I can't. It's not for me. It's okay, sweetheart. I'm sorry. Curtis? Sweetie? Oh! Curtis! No, no, no. Oh! Oh my God. Fuck. You scared the shit out of me. You scared the shit out of me. Oh my God. Where's Olivia? Olivia's working late tonight, so I was just... I was just working on some stuff. Mom, you've got to start... you've got to start trusting me at some point, okay? You hungry? I got Chinese. Fuck. Give your mother a heart attack. I had laid the daggers ready. He could not have missed them. I'm afraid they have awakened, and 'tis not done. The attempt, and not the deed, must confound us. Had he not resembled my father as he slept, I'd have done it. I have done the deed. This is a sorry sight. And a foolish thought, to say a sorry sight. These deeds must not be thought of after these ways. So, it will make us mad. Romantic attachments can make things complicated. She's giving him a reason to live and I could not have done any of it without Olivia. It was very nice. And I hope that they get very close. Well... But you know what they do say about girlfriends and moms? Like oil and water. It's the truth. I'm just saying, it... Hey, could you pass that powder? You know, I actually feel kind of like her mom now too. You know? She doesn't have any one. Her parents both died. She's a nurse? What about it, Mona? It's perfect. Yeah. But she does have access to pharmaceuticals. Oh, good point. Were you the first responder? Yes, sir. Sponsor stopped by and found two bodies. Curtis Cooper and... Olivia Jones. No bruises. Where's our rock star? Right over here. You know his music? What did he play? He was a singer. He had a big hit like three summers ago. You know? Oh yeah. I kind of recognize him. Right? No bruises here either. I'm sorry. You're saying you think his death was accidental? I'm sorry to say, but yes. That's how it looks. Now, did you have any indication that he was using again? Any signs? No. No, quite the contrary. No, no, no changes in his behavior and his mood? Detective. I don't know if you're aware, but my son recently returned from a very serious rehab. Yes. Ma'am I am aware about a month ago. Yes? It just... I got my boy back, huh? Last night. Last night of all nights. It just. He... Why is that? Because he was about the propose? Well, yes. But, but more than that, oh, he and Olivia were starting a life together. And she's pregnant. Is it possible that they may have wanted to celebrate? No, no. Not like that. Olivia is a nurse. She... Was. I know this can be very difficult to hear Mrs. Cooper, but we found traces of a very powerful amphetamine in both their systems. How can you explain that? You want me to figure that out? I'm very sorry for your loss. I'll be in touch. I fear thy nature. It is too full of the milk of human kindness. Be not lost so poorly in your thoughts. Hey guys, can I, uh... talk to you three for a minute? Of course, Lillian. We all owe Curtis and massive gratitude, Lillian. Not only for his music, but for his friendship. I know y'all got high together. No, I'm not blaming anyone. I just, if Curtis was going to use again, who would he call? Billy, you must know. Isn't that one of the jobs of the manager? Lillian, I can understand why you might think that, but no. I've been handling the fallout from the canceled tour. I have lawsuits coming in every day. I haven't spoken to him. I haven't seen him. No, before that. I've been setting up this tour for the past year, Lillian. Coordinating with the record label, promoters, merchandise vendors, people that handle social media, branding. I don't have time, Lillian. Ronin. You are going to write the name and number of his dealer on this, for me. Please. Curtis was a private guy. Ronin, on the day of my son's funeral. Please. Dealer's name is Taz. Thank you, Ronin. Thank you. ♪ And when the rain fell, you took control ♪ ♪ Out of the shadows, you brought your own ♪ ♪ I know 'cause I'm with it ♪ So, what happened here? What killed Curtis Cooper and his fiancé is paramythoxyamphetamine. PMA. A designer drug dealers sell, passing it off as a substitute for another drug, more popular ecstasy. PMA is cheaper and has similar effects, but it's more toxic so it can kill in much lower doses. Taz? You're a girl. So are you. No, I... Get in. What are you in to? PMA. Something tells me that's not really your flavor. Are you a cop? No. Just a concerned citizen. Actually, I'm Curtis Cooper's mother. - Shit. - Mmm. I'm really sorry for your loss. Um, this is a very sensitive subject. So I'm going to need you to get out of my car, At any time, before my son died, did you speak with him? I said get the fuck out of my car. It's a simple yes or no. Yes. Or no? I heard Curtis dried out. I hadn't talked to him in months. Look, I've got rules, okay? I never saw anyone fresh out of clean up. Too much fallout. Too many OD's. And I never move PMA. Like I said, I'm really sorry for your loss. But if I have to say get to fuck out of my car one more time... Thank you, Miss Taz. Babe. Babe! Ah! Lady Macbeth. Cleopatra. Esther Prenn from the Scarlet Letter. That A gives her away. Medea.... The Deathly Light. I don't know that one. What's that? Yeah. It's a play loosely based on an Edgar Allan Poe short story. Poe always gave me the creeps. Is there a role you haven't played you'd like to? Portia. Portia. She swallows fire. Ooh. She eats hot coals and burns from the inside. And how would you show that on stage? Oh, well usually it's not shown, but I'm actually talking about, you know, telling the historical truth of Portia, a woman who would do such a thing. Wow. I don't know if I can find a writer. Mm. Very good. You know you committed a felony when you got into the drug dealer's car? It's illegal to be in a motor vehicle containing contraband. I'm just trying to get to the bottom of this. And I was able to get in touch with a person that sold my son drugs in the past. I wouldn't take a criminal's word, for anything. I think I can tell when somebody is telling me the truth or not, Detective. That is my job. And what do you think my job is Mrs. Cooper? Don't play detective. We have the lab results. We know what happened. And you really think it's just as simple as all that? You're not alone in what you're feeling. A lot of parents have gone through this. I see it all the time. So, just business as usual for you? No, no. Look. Curtis may have gotten a hold of some bad stuff. He may have had a bad reaction. I wish to hell that wasn't the case, but it is. Don't you think that there's just a... tiniest possibility that somebody set them up to make it look like an overdose? No. No. There's just no evidence of that. The case is closed Mrs. Cooper. Now, our guy's out of there. You can do with the apartment whatever you want. Now promise me you won't go talking to any more drug dealers or anything like that. Lil, are you okay to do this? Yeah. Yeah, I'll be fine. You know, I can stay. That's okay. I'm really, I... I'll stay a little bit. You don't need to. I thank you so much for your help. You don't need to thank me. I'm going to make us coffee. Is there coffee here? I don't know if there is any. I am going to go out and I'm going to get us coffee. How's that? Okay? Yeah. You need a little pick me up. That's what I'm going to do. I'll be right back. I got a little something for you. For me? Why? Well, it's not exactly for you, but I hope it's okay. Oh my God. Lillian. I just couldn't resist. It's so adorable. - Are you expecting someone? - MmMmm. You get it. Lilly. Are you all right? No. No, I'm not. Ms. Cooper, thanks again so much for coming by. I'm sorry I couldn't make it to the service. I was traveling. I hope you got the flowers. This is your idea of how to exploit my son's death? Exploiting is not what we're about. We want to do right by Curtis. The tribute album and the memorial concert, it's a... to honor your boy's memory. We want to make sure we pick the best images. This label's like, like a family. You know, every artist matters to us. The truth is you could put me back in my old studio apartment with nothing, but you know, a view of a brick wall. As long as I had my records. That's what it's about. That's why this record is so important. And that's why I insisted on having your input as his mother. I imagine actually you need my input as his mother for the approval of his likeness, right? Well, I mean, we don't need it per se. It's, we could go in another direction, but a photo of your boy would be a nice thing. And you know, Curtis is going to be a bigger star now than ever before. What makes you think I care about that? Because his talent... I mean, he had the kind of talent that deserves to be remembered forever. Not bad. This is, this is my boy. I like that one. What's the matter? Do you know this photographer? That is from the Dangerous Star photo shoot. So I'm not sure. I like, I like that one. Do you want... is that the one you want to go with? Uh, yeah. Yeah. This one. I love it. Great. Perfect. Uh, too much. Little, three quarters. Oh yeah. That's nice. This is good. Hi. Hi. I'm sorry guys. I have a guest. I'll, uh, just give me a minute. So, uh, what brings you over? Well, I understand you shot photos of my son for his album, and I wonder why you didn't tell me that. What was I going to say? You could have told me you knew him in a different context than the... Well, he didn't use my photo. Why did you really come here? To apologize for the whole knife in my car thing? No, actually I came to see if you could help me. Look, I know you're not responsible for the death of my son, but you did supply him along the way, right? So what, what do you need? Information. I don't dispense info for anyone. That's kind of a major tenant for staying in business. I understand. I do. They're using your photo now. Geez. Wow. I just never imagined my photo would end up on an album cover like this. That's a beautiful picture of him. A side rarely seen, I mean, and you captured it. Maybe you brought it out in him. Taz, don't tell me you don't give a shit. What would you like me to say? I liked him a lot. We had fun. Okay. I'm sorry. I feel really fucking shitty about everything that happened. I have other photos from this shoot of Curtis and the band. If you want to see them. Oh my God. I've known that boy since he was a little tiny thing. Billy. Billy knew my husband back when. Oh my God, that guitar. He loved that pattern in grade school. He got a pair of sneakers with spots on them like a cheetah. He thought it would make him run faster. Do you, um. Oh, no thank you. When did you say these were taken? Two years ago. Could you print up a copy of this one for me too, please? Of course. So you're going to help me? I stayed so far away from all of that shit, and I have very high-end clientele, and I don't need them croaking on me for some bad PMA. You don't grow your own pot or mushrooms? You don't have a cocoa plant in the closet, right? Of course not, you have suppliers, and surely someone knows how PMA moves through the city. Sniffing around can get me really up fucked up.

You're in a rock band. I prefer recording. I like the studio life. I talked to that Taz. I was surprised to learn that she is actually a decent photographer. And you knew Olivia pretty well. I don't know why they wouldn't have told you. Maybe they felt guilty. They were seeing each other for a full year while we were together. Must've upset you? Yeah. You know, I was no angel either. Especially on tour. Where the problems began. I got to get back. Ronin. Did Olivia ever use? I really don't know. I'm about to play a song I wrote for Curtis. I'm still working on it, but I want it to be ready for the memorial. Want to hear it? No. I don't. Yeah. Just don't make me regret it. Oh, I really appreciate it. Really. Those are the three guys who move PMA through the city. So what are you going to do? I don't know. Add just a splash of water once every week to 10 days. Now these can get to root rot as quick as look at you, if you sit in soggy soil, even for short periods. Can I help you? Just looking. Do you have a pit? This can be toxic to animals if they eat the leaves. So make sure they don't... Put it up off the floor, keep it up on the table, for example. So the dogs and cats don't get to it. I want you to know this label is like family. You know, every artist matters. Curtis is going to be a bigger star now than ever before. Look like the innocent flower, but be the serpent underneath. ...and no water. Just in about four or five days, just a little splash around the outside of the pot. Fuck. For fuck's sake. You better fucking answer my calls, little man. The yellow brick road doesn't lead to Oz, mate. It leads to me. I'm the bloody wizard and we have a major fucking emergency. Lillian Cooper calling Detective Eaton, please. No, please, please don't put me on hold. Well, this is the third time I've left a message for Detective Eaton, so. Yes, Lillian Cooper. I'm sure the detective will know what it's about. Thank you. Revenge his foul, unnatural murder. Leave... not one... eye. ♪ Like a captain, we're found ♪ They say Elvis is worth more dead than alive. So sick fucks are making a shit ton of money off Curtis's death. Yeah. Cops just don't want to hear it. Now look at that son of a bitch. Oh, God Look. That guy is really fucking scary. They call him "The Gardener" because... he slit a guy's throat with gardening tools. If you're really going to do this... Death is the only water to wash away this dirt. Where did you get your gun? What? Your gun. Where did you get it? I got it for protection. Look having a gun isn't always such a clever idea. You go waltzing around these sketch balls and bad things are bound to happen. Bad things have already happened. What do you want me to do? Go dig around on Craigslist? I will. These three assholes have to pay. But it's still not going to bring him back. But justice will be served. Don't spoil your appetite. Hey, just don't go without this. Active ingredients. You were just amazing. And when you kicked that cop in the nuts. "There's your blow job." I love that. What movie was that? - Uh, Cookie. - Your Medea was superb. - My what? - Madea. I've never seen it done quite like that. So "capital B Bitchy" with a twist of Hepburn. Audrey of course. Oh yeah. And what is the capacity? Uh, 95. Have you also directed before? Oh, well summers Coop and I up in Vermont, children's theater. I think I know what I'm doing. Of course you do. Trap door. Oh! Addie. I missed you so much. I think there's a do very nicely. I greatly appreciate the help. So, this is the emergency exit. In case the shit hits the fan. Goes right to the alley. Depending on the size of the cast, we can usually provide one or two senior members of the company with their own private space. I gave up my space once for Tony Danza. I'm assuming you want your own. A Tony spot would be great. Ah. Okay. It's our finest and largest dressing room. I call it the presidential suite. That vanity was a gift for my mom on Julius Caesar. Oh, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth that I am meek and gentle with these butchers. That cot is special. It's where I get all my beauty sleep. Not that you need any. I, well, it... It will be my last play. Don't say that. Every exit is an entrance someplace else. What do you mean? Could you, um, give me a moment here? Yes. If you need anything, please. If thou didst ever thy dear Mother, love. Revenge his foul, unnatural murder. Fare thee well ones, the glowworm shows the matin to be near, and 'gins to pale her uneffectual fire. Adieu, sweet Hamlet. Adieu. Remember me! Oh. Shit. What the fuck are you suppose to be? Oh fuck. The fuck is this? What do you want? I know what you did. What did I do, love? What have I done? I want to know how you did it. Get your fucking PMA in my son. Fucking priceless. Mommy, dearest huh? But you're not going to use that gun. You're not going to use the gun. You don't know how to. Now give it to me. How'd you do it? You are not going to use that fucking... Why don't we try to schedule something once we get closer? Back on in two Mrs. Cooper. Ah! That one may smile, and smile vehemently. Are you okay? Oh yeah. How do I look? Like a ghost. An award-winning ghost. The villain, the slave, is not twentieth part, the tithe of your precedent, Lord. No. A king of shreds and patches. Save me and hover o'er me with your wings. Oh, heavenly guards. What would your gracious figure? Alas. She smat. Do not forget. This visitation is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose. Oh, look amazement on thy father sits, step between him and his fighting soul. Speak to him, Hamlet. How you doing? Ah, great. What happened to your leg? Ah, nothing. I... sorry about the shoe. I've always been a fan. You don't have to say that. I've always been a fan. If it happens again. What? The audience got a kick out of it. Lillian Cooper is a serious actress. A real tragedienne. Just because you're the director doesn't mean you can change a costume at your own whim. Hamlet is a tragedy, not a fucking farce. I'm, It won't happen... If you're really going to do this, do it courageously. Do it gloriously. Do it right. Speak. I am bound to listen. As you are to revenge. I am thy mother's spirit. Doomed for a certain term to walk the night and for the day confined to fast in fires 'til the foul crimes done in my days of nature, are burnt and purged away. Were I not forbid to tell the secrets of my prison house, I could a tale unfold whose lightest word would harrow thy soul. If thou didst ever thy dear mother love... Oh God. Revenge this foul, unnatural murder. Murder? Murder. You have that much talent. And I don't know how you could just walk away from it all. I'll never understand it. Plaque went up pretty fast. Yeah. You getting a lot of work off this masterpiece? That's a great picture, but don't quit your day job. Night job. You have the best candy. I don't like being left out in the cold. I'll keep that in mind. Every color in the rainbow. The usual. Always a pleasure doing business. Likewise. Goodbye Claude. Hey! In the chest, you say? Yes, in the chest. What the fu...? Much lower actually, below the stomach. Um, you've got the wrong guy. And now sir, I am going to shoot you. Do you think they'll make a tribute album for you? Oh, there you are. I just knocked. One of the stage left lights is out. It's fucking annoying. So as you enter just stand more stage right. Okay? Oh, yeah good. Got it. See you later. Oh, sweet Hamlet. A murderer and a villain. The slave is not twentieth part the tithe of the precedent, my Lord. No more! Mrs. Cooper? Mrs. Cooper? A king of shreds and patches. - I'm not saying anything. - I know, I... - Hey, hey. - Goodnight. - Hey, um, Lillian. - What? I just want to say, I'm so impressed. You know that you're getting back out there and doing this play after... Thank you. What you've been through, and it's inspiring. All right. What do you want? What? Do you want me to say I'm sorry? Why would you say you're sorry? You only sent the audience out of the theater, all expecting a refund. I'm out $20,000. I've got everything in this. Why would the great Lillian Cooper apologize for any of that? I don't know what you've been up to. What crazy rituals we've got going on here, but you're out. Out? Hey, you know. I, I directed this play. You can't just. It's my theater, my production. No, it was my idea. No, it was Shakespeare's idea. Newsflash women have been playing Hamlet since the 1800's. Okay? The first Hamlet recorded on film was a woman. The first radio Hamlet was a woman. Your idea? No. No. You can't do that! You can't! - Hey! - You can't let this happen! Hey! Hey, hey! Okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Ah! I don't know. Walls are pretty bland, And you're kind of tense. Maybe you should loosen up a little. Well, you got anything that can help with that? Well, the record label paid me to take a photo of you, not get you high. So. Can't it be both? No. I'm going to use that plant to liven up this photo. Hey, how are you doing Taz? How's it going? Ronin, can I get a word with you? Hey Billy. All right. Call me when the shoot's over. Oh. That looks great, right? Curtis' mom was a big fan of your work. Has she got in touch with you? Yeah. She's pretty intense. Yeah, she's an intense woman. What did she want? Um, she just wanted some old photos of Curtis. Messy situation, isn't it? I guess so. He hired me to take some photos of Ronin. So I went over to his new place yesterday. And I don't know. It just, it creeped me out. He even has Curtis's brand of cigarettes. Who, I know. Like what? Why? He doesn't even smoke. He used to give Curtis such shit about it. And then Billy came over, and they go outside and they're all hush hush. And I, it just... It just felt like... Ronin is in on the whole fucking thing. It all felt so fucking weird. Hey, man. Look man, I hated the way things ended. I mean, we can't part ways like that. That shit that Billy said, it was totally uncalled for. And I said some stuff too that I really wish I could take back. You know. Do what you gotta do. Start a new life. Start fresh. I really don't want there to be any bad blood between us. Hey Mrs. Cooper. Hey! How you doing Ronin? So we're going to sit down for dinner. You're welcome to join us. Yeah. Place looks nice, man. Some things you can't quit. Huh? They may not get you high, but they'll kill you just as quick. How was the run? Oh. Run of your show. Oh. We, we closed. Had a great time though. Yeah. Hamlet. Can't go wrong. There was, um, some new developments. Maybe think might be related to your son's death. I'd like to talk to you about it. Mind if I come up? We can talk about it here. I'm listening. The man who ran your son's record label was murdered a few days ago. Claude Felson. I heard about that. It's a shame. You were at the theater Tuesday, between 9:30 and 10. Well yes, I was. What about last week? Same gig. You know this man? We think there's a connection between his death and Claude's. Well, does it have something to do with my son? Both were killed with the same make and model firearm. Ballistics is checking to see if it's the exact same gun. And this guy is one of the biggest importers of PMA in the city. That's the drug that killed your son Mrs. Cooper. Yes. I know what that is. It's starting to sound like you might think my son's death was not so accidental. I'm just asking questions. Now you're asking questions. You have a good night, Mrs. Cooper. You as well, Detective. Stay safe. Thank you. Hello? Any update? Update? They followed me. And I'm scared. Who? Police.

Just like you always dreamed of. Well, business is good. Sorry. I'm feeling a little off, you know, just losing two close friends in a few weeks. And... what happened to Claude is just. Oh, you told me you had a song for Curtis or something? Could I hear it? It's not finished, but you sure? Yeah. I'd love to hear it. I just want it to be perfect. I bet you do. He always liked things perfect. Even as a little boy. He was like a brother to me. He was my son. Why don't I play that song for you? Yeah. You do that. Supposing the pistol was not stolen, and the owner was discovered. You know, it may not be a single, but I think it's my favorite track so far. Oh. For your solo album. I have thought of death. Dreamt of it. Would have even prayed. If it were fit that such as I should pray for anything. But if death be in this cup, I bid thee think again, before thou beholds me drink it. Please? Even now, it is upon my lip. Oh, shit. Lillian. How old was Curtis when he made these recordings? I don't know. Uh, 15, 16 years old. I found them. I just, I don't know what to do with them. These are priceless. Really? Yes. These are demos of some of his hits, acoustic versions. There's a lot of material here that I'm not familiar with. Now, if it's okay with you, I'm going to take them. I'll have them digitize, cataloged, and then I'll be in touch with you about a release. You know, what's best. Toast? None for me. Thanks. You know, that stuff will kill you. Oh. All right, you twist my arm. To Curtis. To Curtis. All right. That's some seriously cold vodka. You ever seen this before Billy? Yeah. That's beautiful.

The other was a man sitting, huddled, nursing a wounded leg. And then it all went black. And there was this woman thing creeping toward the one without a head. And she reached down and touched it. Sprang back and cried, "He's dead." Good to see you back on stage again. Detective Eaton, what a surprise. You were simply amazing. So, you get a lot of time to kill backstage? Even when an actor's waiting backstage, they're still working. Oh yeah. Yeah. I never thought of it like that. Oh, um, I finally read that Edgar Allen Poe story that your play is based on. Killing with a candle that emits poisonous vapor. A Deathly Light. That's one tricky son of a bitch. I thought you said something about coming to apologize? Yeah, I did. You were right about Curtis and Olivia. their death not being an accident. I wanted to acknowledge that and say I'm sorry. Lillian. Just let me help you. He even has Curtis' brand of cigarettes. I know. Like what? Why? He doesn't even smoke. He used to give Chris such shit about it. You were right. About Curtis and Olivia. their death not being an accident. I wanted to acknowledge that and say, I'm sorry. Thank you. I also wanted to say that I underestimated you. I won't do that again. Justice will be served. Justice will be served. Justice will be served.
