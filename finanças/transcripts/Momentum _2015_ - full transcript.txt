This thing goes high up. In addition, do you trust them? No, but I have got an insurance policy. She is flying in tonight. So this is how things are going to go. I am going to get drunk, soak in a tub for a couple, You are going to get me the hell out of the country... by tomorrow night. I have you set up in town. Our old place. Come on, you used to love it there. I do not remember any complaints. I have a few now. The bag. I have to hang on to this until me... I am not taking it. Jeez! You look like shit, by the way. I guess you have knocked the wind out of me. Consider these an advance. Reports say one of the four thieves... was shot and killed by a member of his own gang. Police has an eyewitness, but no description. Of the perpetrators has been released as of yet. We will bring you updates as they come in. 3 has discovered that the eye... witness has described to police the killer... of the fourth gunman. In a CBN exclusive, we have obtained the police... sketch of that suspect. I am Peter. That is better. 2:15 SUNDAY 24 AUGUST UNKNOWN - SLIDE TO REPLY STILL WAITING... ARE YOU COMING? Did you lock yourself out? Yeah. I can take you to the front desk. They will issue the new key card. No, no need. My husband is inside. He is just a heavy sleeper. Darling, there you are. Was she wandering around the hotel again? She does that. Thanks for bringing her home. No problem. You folks have a nice evening. I like this. What? The hair, it is good. I love the green eyes. Yeah, the blue was a bit. I do not know... cold. Why did you leave me standing out there? Sorry, I was in the bathroom. Thanks for getting dressed, by the way. I thought it was an emergency. It is. Yeah, then you better tell me I am getting out of here tonight. No. However, do you know that insurance? I was telling you about. I think I may have found something even better. However, I am going to need your talents to unlock it. I am not making this up. Look! I may have lied to you about many things, but not something this big. Hey, come on. Do not you remember anything good about us? About me? You are such an asshole. You know I had to leave. Shit, that is she. Quick, hide. What? Why? She is only expecting me to be here. She will run. Trust me get out of sight. Go, go, go, go, and go. Really, Kevin? Another woman. Hey, Jessica, come on in. Hi, Kev. I am so sorry. Come on. Get up. Hey, come on, man, let her go. She did not do anything. I will... I will... I will... I will... What, Mr. Fuller? Check the purse, find the phone. Pass code. I cannot tell you. Why is that? Because once you know what is on there, I will be useless to you. In addition, you will just kill me. That is true. But I can offer you the option of a painless death. If you tell me the pass code. Six. Six, six, six. Good girl. Nice. The blackmail? Really? That was your master plan. I hope you had the foresight to make a backup. No, you did not, did you? Shame. I am a man who keeps his promises. What? What? No, stop! Jesus Christ! Jess. I am sure we could... We could make a deal. No. No, I am afraid, Mr. Fuller... that the time for deals is over. Now you seem you forgotten that our mutual employer... has extremely long arms. The Senator can go fuck him. Thank you. I shall take great pleasure in informing him that you said. Now, Mr. Fuller, if you tell me where the diamonds are... this night will get exponentially shorter, and potentially, a great deal less painful. No? All right! Hurt him. My fucking arm. Where are they, Mr. Fuller? Do not hurt me... I will tell you the honest truth, Mr. Fuller. I do not really give a flying fuck where those diamonds are. What I am interested in is the little electronic device... that was stored with them. You find this funny, do you? Yeah. Every man pictures the way he is going to die, and this is just not what I expected. Who said anything about dying? God, what the fuck is that? God! Fuck! Fuck. Let me make this easier for you, Mr. Fuller. If you do not tell me where the bag is. I will find your family. I will have your wife raped until she is dead. No, God, no. Then I will sell your child... to slavery in the very worst deep... hell hole I can find. Fuck! I cannot... fuck you! Fuck the Senator. And fuck this bed which is probably made in China. Skewer his fucking shoulder. It is your last chance, Mr. Fuller! MADE IN CHINA You are going to talk. Everybody does. Do it again. All right! Okay, okay. Why has he stopped to move? Wake him up. I think he is dead. What do you mean he is dead? No, he cannot die until I say he dies. For fuck's sake. Okay, okay, search him for ID, see where he lives. Maybe he stashed the diamonds there. Then clean up this fucking mess. WASHINGTON, D.C. It is the call you are waiting for, Senator. Yes, of course! You all excuse me. Save a couple dances, darling. Do you have him? Not exactly, Sir, but the girl handled in addition, the video has erased. On that front, at least, you are safe. The video is embarrassing. The drive is treason. You best find it. Yes, we will toss the room before we leave. I am confident we will find it. Speaking of overconfident, How is our friend. Is Mr. Fuller cooperating? Yes, Mr. Fuller, how can I say this...? He checked out of this hotel. As soon as we find his partners. I will call you. I let you know. Mr. Washington? Are you there? Oops! Witness! Shit. PLEASE DO NOT DISTURB Backup, eleventh floor. She shot my foot in two. What is going on out here? Ebola outbreak! Get back in your room. Hey there, I really need to get to a hos...! I took you for a working girl. You know, wrong place, wrong time, that kind of thing. Then I found this little baby in your room. A Vector SP1, custom edition. Nice gun, pro's gun. So now, I have to assume that you... are part of the Kevin's posse. Maybe you are even that smashing... a little red head that the news services are so excited about. Kind of sloppy though, was not it? Are getting your face seen like that? Your face is vaguely familiar to me. Have we met before? You would remember me. Maybe. I would remember that tie. Right now, I think my tie is the least of your problems. I am going to blow his head off. No. She is good. Really fucking well. Let us go down. She thinks she is being clever, but I have seen... this in far too many movies. Go back up the stairs. Go back up. The laundry room. She is on the sky bridge headed for the parking. Thanks. I really like this woman. What the...? Shit! Fuck! Engaging in confrontation. She is not responding. I am free. Stop immediately. Pull over. Pull over. I repeat. Pull over! This is your last warning. Shit! Ouch! I will smash your goddamn head. - Who is it? - It is I. Let me in. You are out of your goddamn mind coming here. Just let me in. Please? Please, that is new. I do not think I have ever...! Quiet! Open that goddamn door. That is more I like it. Choke on it, you dumb bitch. Hey! Do you want to make 10 grand for pressing a button? Open the damn door. Let me in. Ten grand? Yes. Let me in and I will give it you. Show it to me. There is no time. Come on. Come on. Come on! I am counting. They are after to me. Who is after you? You did not bring the gobs cops here, did you? No, they are fucking cleaners. Serious goddamn cleaners! Why should I help you? Because they killed Kevin. Get in! Nice nose. Here, keep it. For Kev's funeral. Always knew you were a softy. I barricaded the door. Heavy artillery? Not much, just what the law allows. I docked everything else in case, we busted. You do not worry! This will get the job done. Nice. Thanks. It needs something, though. You are right. Not sure what, though. Are you going somewhere? With your face being all over the news. I thought it might be better to lay low somewhere... with no extradition law. I need your laptop. I look like I have a fucking laptop! Okay, a desktop, a fucking tablet, anything? Please tell me you at least have a phone. In the back. Wow! Wow! What the fuck are you doing? I do not want them to think we are hiding. That is the only way in there. Let them come. Make your phone call. The old bastard and I will take care of it. Hello? Penny? It is Alex. Here, kitty, kitty, kitty. - Leave us alone. - Listen to me... No, you listen to me. You stay away from my family. - Is that piece of shit with you? - No, he is not. He is... He should not be with you. You will kill him. Listen to me. You and your kid are in danger. You need to get out. What have you gotten him involved? Shut up! Look! Kevin has a secret hiding place. Do not you worry? Daddy is home. He has a lovely fish dinner for you. He keeps things in there. I am sure he told you about it. I do not know what you are talking about. You know exactly what I am talking about. Now, there is enough there to care of you forever. There should also be a package for me. My husband is out of your kind of business. Hey! Do you like the house you are living? Where do you think he got the money for it? My God! That bank yesterday! That was you two. He promised me. Look! Just take what is in there moreover, bring the package to... I am not bringing to you anything. God! This is not about you and me anymore. He is my husband, not yours. He chose me, so get over it and leave me alone. Goddamn it! Put the phone down. Come on. You have to another piece. Lubitz, I got it. Come on in, fellas. Join the party. Let us dance. Behind you! Try under the bed. Well! That was subtle. Where is your sense of fucking finesse? Get out. Dunk off! Fuck! Hello. Hello. What is your name? Matthew Michel Fuller. Hello, Matthew Michel Fuller. My name is Mr. Johnson. I am calling from the telephone company. You sound like you are a very big boy. Yes, Sir. I am almost six. Six, really, well, that is old. Are you a clever boy, Matthew? Yes? Well, let us see just how clever you are, shall we? I am going to give you a little test, all right? Okay. Do you know your full address? 7415 Glen Avenue. You are clever. Well done, Matthew! Do you want to know anything else? No, no, that is, that is quite... all right for today, Matthew. If ever I should meet you, I am going... to give you a very big prize. Okay, nice talk to you. Nice talk to you, good-bye. All right! I know where she is heading. Let us move out. Tell Ms. Pinder to get her ass in gear and join us. God! Kevin, what did you do? You need to get the...! Jerk! Fuck! REPUBBLICA ITALIANA D'AMICO MONICA Mommy? Baby! You got scared. I did. Do you want some food? Come. How about some crunchy Choc? vampire? - Yeah. - Yeah. Matthew, did not I tell you to put your toys away last night? Yeah, I forgot. Hurry up and eat. Mommy needs five minutes. We are going a trip today, okay? Okay. I will be right back. CHOCO SCOOPS Hey, baby, how are you doing? I am downstairs. Grab your helmet. Come on. Hey, hey, come back here. Matthew, I need you to get dressed right now. Hurry. Matthew? Mattie? Matthew? Thank God, Matthew, we have to go. There is someone outside. What? I think they want to come in. Good morning! Early bird, etcetera, etcetera. Mattie. Mommy. That is what we are looking for. Mommy, I am scared. Yes? Mommy. One moment. Matthew, there is a grown up on the phone. Do not be rude. What is the situation back at the hotel? We have made good time. We are ready to dispose of the garbage. I will be back in 10 minutes. Could you clean up here? No problem. In addition, the woman? Do with them what you will. Daddy, where is my Daddy? Tragic. Goodbye, Matthew. We have a few minutes to kill, so to speak. I like that. I would like to spend a few minutes with her. Yeah, right, new person. You handle the kid. Go. Get him. Mommy! Come here, kid. Get down from there, kid. Santa is not up there. Do you think this is a game? I do. Please... Please. Come on. Come on. Run. Run and hide. Run. Come on. You know I want to. You know I want to. Now that you will be single. I am going to enjoy this. Come on. Hey, big man! Hey, look! I do not want him to see this. What? I am killing you. No, but you are in the ball part. Hey! I want you to stay in here and do not come out... until I get you. I will be right back, okay. You move, I will kill your kid. I know what you are thinking. I took that idiot in the other room, I can take this person, right. Right? Drop it. Drop it. Ouch! For play. Drop it. Do you want to play? Let us play. You son of a bitch! It is okay, it is okay. It is over. You got him. You got him. Matthew. Yes? Good morning, Mr. Washington! Good morning, Sir. My apologies for hanging up too abruptly on you earlier. We have had something of trying day. Never mind that. Do you have the Drive? Yeah, we may have hit a little bit of a snag... in that department, Sir. You do not bullshit the bulls hitter. You had Mr. Fuller in your hand seven hours ago. What went wrong? Well! One of Fuller's associates. She is highly trained, possibly ex-military. I suppose I should thank you for coming back for us. It is what Kevin would want. We are even not... You just saved my life. I guess I did. Ironic, considering all the times I wished you dead. Kevin wanted to get out. No, he did not. Kevin always preferred the easy way out. You know. Take it instead of earn it. Those people are going to be back. They murdered Kevin and they will kill us too... unless I kill them first. What is on the Drive? I have no idea, but I am about to find out. EXTRACTING ARCHIVE INDEX GPS LOCK SENDING LOCATION DATA TO HOST LOCATION FOUND Shit! We have to get out of here. They tracked the Drive, now they know where it is. How can I help? What about Matthew? I can leave him with my mother. Sir, it is just a logistical thing... Nothing for you to worry about it. Politics is logistics, son, and I worried plenty, especially about highly trained ex-military woman. You cannot seem to deal with. Yes, I have a plan, Sir. Well! Good. Run it by Doug when he gets there. Sir, I can assure you there is absolutely no need to send Mr. MacArthur. We have the situation well in hand. Do you? Well, good. He can use the vacation. This business has him a little upset. He is in the air now. He should be landing in a few hours. Yes, Sir, I very much look forward to work with him. I hope you have a good fucking night too. Back in five. It is all under control, Sir. Do I detect some frustration? Alternatively, doubt, Mr. Washington. How did you...? Does redial ring a bell? You should be alone when you give away your best tricks. Therefore, you were there. Where, may I ask? This magician do not reveal her secrets. I tell you that work. I will be a good sport and give you a head start. If I were you, I get out of that hotel. Because the cops are on the way. You are not going to call the cops. Even if you were that stupid. We would be out of this hotel, before. Clever girl! Move it. She made us. SHARK Ms. Clinton comes with me. Mr. Jefferson stays here. Then can we get me the fricking doctor? My foot feels like it is going fall. Forget it. He is right on the edge. If you think, he will not throw you in along with the garbage. In the trunk, you are wrong. Yeah? Alex, I need to tell you something. It is about the diamonds. I cannot talk right now. Stick with the plan. We have to stop meeting like this. Open. Open. Where is he? He probably went to take a leak. This is what you get for hiring a halfwit. Mind your head, Kevin. Do you think we will see her again? Undoubtedly! We have what she wants. She would not risk it. Of course, she would. Talk of the devil. There you are. I missed you at the hotel. I did not miss you. I want my property. Well, of course you do. Diamonds are a girl's best friend after all. Very funny! I aim to please. You know. This could be a mutually... beneficial relationship. Now do you want a relationship? Do not. Stop it. People say we are falling in love. Yeah, I love this. Give me back my diamonds. Yeah, except they are not actually yours, are they? Strictly speaking, they belong to a senator. Because the Senator needs more money. I do not think so. They are mine now. We both know the Senator did not hire us to steal the diamonds. He hired us to steal the Drive. Therefore, I am going to go ahead and call Kevin's murder a breach of contract and take... the diamonds as compensation. I guess you have a point. How can I get them to you? If I... I do not know where are you? I will give you a hint. It is rectangular, way out of the date, and it stinks. I see. If you are looking for the diamonds in that car. I am afraid you are going to be sorely disappointed. Not at all. I found just what I was looking for. He would like to say hi. Open it. Say hello to the nice man. She has a gun in my mouth. Excuse me? He said she has a gun in my mouth. So let us make a deal. I will trade you this piece of shit for my diamonds. Otherwise, his head whistles. Well! As I do not really care whether you turn him into a flute or not, I am afraid the only deal I am doing... is for the Drive. So... I will give you your Diamonds as you... so fond of calling them, you give me the Drive, and we all skip away happy. I do not negotiate. Offer is on the table. You have five seconds. What? No more witty banter! Four. Three. Nothing suits you. Two. Last chance. I just do not think you are this cold. No. She has a gun in my mouth. Help me! Please! One. Where is she? I did not see her. Why would you let her get away? I never saw her. You stop that fucking horn. Shit! Damn, she is good. Now where is she? I have no idea, but she is certainly full of surprises. I liked that coat! Right this way, people. Right this way. Goddamn, she is still here. Do you ready, Jessica? You are going to look just like me. Hey, Penny, it is I. Now, listen, here is the plan. I have right here in my hand what it is you want. However, if you want it, you have to come, and get it. Is not it time we were properly introduced? Do you know face to face? Is this face to face enough for you? You continue to delight and amaze. You are really, really starting to piss me off. I am sorry. I really cannot imagine why. One more step and he takes flight. Yeah? Then you will come right with me. I am bored. Wake her up. Sorry about your clothes. Ms. Clinton, here, was a little over enthusiastic... in her search for the Drive. Do you care for a game? Go fuck yourself. I am glad to see you have not lost your sense of elegant repartee. I fed up playing these two. Give me a challenge. I thought already had. Touch?! Come on. I do not play. Strange. I had you pegged for a chess champion. Maybe high stakes poker is more your thing, what with that... expressive face of yours. Now, you have something I want. I have something you want. No, that is not quite right, is it? Because what you want... is in fact entirely worthless. Did Kevin fuck you over? Because I know you did not steal a bag of broken windshield glass. Now, looks as if the only thing you have left to bargain with... is your life. You should know this about me. I always get what I want. So, tell me. Where is the Drive? Fuck you! You give me little choice. Frank. You prepare her leg. Now if you do not help me with my problem. Then I cannot finish my business. And if I do not finish my business, then the Senator does not pay me. The Senator does not pay me. You just love to talk. Do not you? This is your final chance. Where is the Drive? Okay! Let us kick off with a couple turns. Couple more likes that and your leg... is going to be two-dimensional. Which is one more dimension? Than your personality! Will ever achieve. Again. You know, that leg is going pop. In addition, when it does, it is only a matter of time... before the gangrene sets in. Green has always been my best color. Good. Just as well. Again. Hold on. Tie it up. Where is the Drive? All right! What is in it for me? If I help you. What is in it for me? At the very least, your leg. At the most, your life. You fuck are right! Go on. Keep going. Enough! You really are prepared to lose your leg. You are quite the remarkable. Back off, both of you. You remind me of a story. An Urban legend, perhaps. About seven years ago. I was doing some, freelance work... should we call it, for the agency in Cairo. There was a great deal of chatter about a senior member of the Palestinian Authority that was... coming into the town for a sit down chitchat... with some Egyptian Ministers. And the word on the street was that he... housed in... an impenetrable government owned... fortress. You can guess what happened. There was a massive bomb, but it was set... on the inside of the building. A little birdie told me. That the CIA had struck a deal, letting Mossad borrow an incredibly talented... and creative entry specialist. She, yes, indeed, it was a woman. She was the very best in the world at penetrating the most... impenetrable places, then, poof. Disappearing without a trace. I will admit. The story always fascinated me. This hero, and ultimate tragedy for her blast... did not kill its intended target. But instead, it claimed the lives of his three sweet young children, and their poor mother. He amazingly escaped with only minor injuries. I often thought about that female operative. You know, what went wrong, do you think? It was poor intelligence, shoddy equipment... or plain bad fucking luck. Did she feel any remorse? Alternatively, did she manage to compartmentalize... the death of the mother, and her three children? Perhaps a man might do. Anyway, the long and the short of it... was the CIA dropped her as quickly... as the proverbial hot brick. She threatened to go all Edward Snowden on them, and they retaliated by spinning she is a double agent slash terrorist. How the might fall! What do you think, Alex? Do you think such a mythical creature could possibly exist? Because, the demons she must carry. Now... I am going to take a different tact here. I could always go back and finish... that other business, Kevin's wife. Little Matthew in his jammies. You know. Bum! Yeah, that strikes cool, right? I have the feeling that you might back causing yet... to another child infinite pain. Whereas me, I have no such qualms. Why should I believe you? Because I do not lie. Ever. Okay. When and where? Western Cape Airport, tonight, 21:00 hours. I am going to need to make a call. Good girl. Give her a phone. Hello? It is going to be in Cape Town Airport, 9:00 p m tonight. I hate that redial. Do you want to let me up now? Come on. Why do we wait until tonight? Because... It is going to take that long... for Frank, here, to sew you up. You do not worry. It is just a flesh wound to stop you trying run away. You might want to rethink the whole... chess thing. It is good for people in our line of work. This situation here, that is what we call check. Get her dressed. Make her look pretty. WESTERN CAPE INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT Any chances of you go any faster, grandma? Because this really cannot be hurting this much. - Frank? - Come on, are you coming? Here is the key. Here. You are a magician, are not you? Thank you. Take it. No, no, I do not think so. It is not part of the deal. Yes, it is. You get the Drive, I walk away. No, no. Because, funnily enough, I do not trust you. I know your style by now. Your friend knew about the airport all day. Who knows what nasty little surprise might be lurking... behind that locker door? So if you do not mind, I will not take the key. Because you are going to need it to open that locker. Go to hell. Really? Excuse me, officer? What are you doing? Officer? Do not. Can I help you? Darling? POLICE All right! All right! I will do it. Yeah, sorry, there is unattended bag down there, under the stairs. I did not know to whom report it, so... Thank you, Sir. You're welcome! Good work! Shall we? Flight 822 to Casablanca. Departing in five minutes. DARLING ST DIAMOND HEIST It is all yours. Take it out. Here. Open it. Come on. Open it. Happy? Check it. Make sure, there is no surprises. Do you trust me now? Not now, not ever. Fuck! Shit! How did you...? I had to let you catch me, otherwise none of this... would have worked. You are magnificent. Bitch! Stay down! I think this should be our last face to face. Did you hide it on me? That tie was not doing you any favors. It had to be good for something. Stop him. That is he. Stop him. Stop right there. Freeze. Put your hands up. Right now. Put them up. Do not fucking move. Put your hands up. Right now. Get down on the ground. Queen to bishop five. Check mate. You really are the stuff of legends, are not you? Kind of like your tie. Gun! Are you okay, ma'am? Please come with me. I want to ask you a few questions. Okay, just right this way, ma'am. This way, ma'am. Can you remember what happened? I was here to meet my friend Mckayla when I found out. Her flight had been cancelled. Then suddenly there was this explosion, and people started shooting. What is wrong with this world? Schools are not safe, airports. What is next? I am so sorry. Can I go? I am late to fetch my son. I have a few more questions, okay? We like to go through everything with the witnesses while the memory is still fresh. - Hey, Frankie. - Yeah? You have to come see this. Now! We got your number, so go ahead and fetch your son. If we need anything else, I will call you. What is it? You are not going to believe this. I think we got the people that pulled the Darling. Street job yesterday. Is this it? That is all we found. The rest must be with the woman that ran the crew. I do not think so, man. Check this out. Mommy? Tell Matthew I am coming. Everything is going be okay. CRIME SCENE DO NOT ENTER Jesus! Did not the guard say she had some kind of scar on her face? Jesus! This is our girl. What kind of sick mind thinks something like this up? Man! And who carries a head around in a bag! GATE C Lock this airport down. Who is in charge? Are you in charge? Who is asking?
