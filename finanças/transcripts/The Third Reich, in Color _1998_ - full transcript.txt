German tanks roll westwards in the war against France during 1940. This reenactment shot for the first ever Nazi color documents, "Artillery strikes". /Artillerie greift ein/ Only a single copy has survived. For decades it languished unseen in the German Federal Film Archives, known to generations only in black and white, the footage shown in color has an unprecedented impact. These scenes from the French campaign are not the only ones captured in color from World War Two. THIRD REICH IN COLOUR, WORLD WAR TWO. Hitler's personal pilot, than American businessmen, Wehrmacht soldiers, and allied cameramen, all shared one passion - to film history in living color. Thanks to them, unique footage has been preserved for posterity. Scenes of Nazi terror and the Allied resistance, of death at the front, and death at home, of crime and retribution, catastrophic ends and new beginnings. The Second World War - the tragedy of unimaginable scale. When it was finally over, 55 million people had lost their lives. An entire continent lay in ruins, and any hope of peaceful coexistence in Europe seemed gone forever. A full color legacy from a brown shirted past. One of the monthly reports produced by the Regional Film Office of Halle-Merseburg in 1938. In a training camp for the BDM, the Nazi organization for German girls, young recruits practice folk dances. For some years, amateur Nazi filmmakers have been shooting party functions and training courses. But now for the first time, they're using AKVIS new color film to document the role of women in Nazi Germany. Footage of a meeting of the Nazi veterans movement in Freiburg, Sachsen-Anhalt, again commissioned by the Halle-Merseburg Regional Film Office. It isn't always the key occasions in the Nazi state that have survived on these strips of colored celluloid, many of which were buried for decades in the obscurity of state archives and private collections. These rare documents do provide unusual insights into the period, not least, due to the dramatic realism added by the color. The parade of Wehrmacht units in Mülheim an der Ruhr in 1938. The Third Reich is brazenly rehab. The no one is willing to do anything about it. The conditions of the Treaty of Versailles, limiting Germany's armed forces to 100,000 men have been long forgotten. Only two years earlier, this city on the river Ruhr was still a demilitarized, neutral zone. Now the steps of marching German soldiers once again echoes through the streets of the German Reich. After five years, the Hitler regime even seems stable to many foreign observers, high ranking politicians too are blindsided by the dictators touted successes. One such gullible statesman is former British Prime Minister David Lloyd George who visits Hitler's Berghof in September 1936. For three solid hours, the leader of Great Britain's Liberal Party meets with Hitler. They discuss the current political situation and exchange memories of World War One. David Lloyd George is genuinely impressed. He considers the Fuhrer a truly great man. "I only wish we had a man of his supreme quality that the head of affairs in our country today," he writes to a friend. Winston Churchill was to comment tersely in his memoirs, "No one was more completely misled than Mr. Lloyd George." The British politician will not be the only contemporary statesman to believe he can persuade Hitler to keep the peace. Until now, the dictators true ambitions have only been evident in satellite theatres of war. Since July 1936, a civil war has been raging in Spain between nationalist forces and supporters of the socialist Popular Front. On Hitler's personal instructions, German air force units are providing active tactical support to the uprising. With the aid of the so called Condor Legion, city after city falls to the Spanish nationalists. Initially, Hitler had hoped to find a reliable ally in generalissimo Francisco Franco, the Spanish leader, but once Franco had led his fascist regime to victory in 1939, with Germany's aid, Spain opted instead for a course of cautious neutrality. Meanwhile, young Germans are also gearing up for action. Under the auspices of Nazi Regional Director, or Gauleiter, Joachim Eggeling, the Hitler Youth stages a sports tournament in Halle in 1938. The program includes a show by the motorized Hitler Youth, which proves extremely popular. For Reich youth leader Baldur von Schirack, military training for boys is of paramount importance. Our goal, the Hitler Youth handbook states, is to achieve a situation in several years’ time, in which every German boy can handle a rifle as easily and expertly as he does a fountain pen. August 24, 1938, the entire city of Hamburg is decked out in honor of the regent of Hungary. Admiral Miklos von Horthy, who is paying a five day state visit to Germany. Hitler is aiming to persuade his guest to take part in the imminent campaign against Czechoslovakia. The immense popularity Hitler enjoys among the German people, has now given him the confidence to embark upon the pursuit of his true goals. "Every generation," he confides to one of his aides "should experience a war." The small community of Mühlberg near Halle is holding its school and fatherland festival. Employees from the Institute for Ethnicity Studies, film the parade for posterity. The seemingly innocuous scenes reveal the reality of National Socialist Germany. The party controls every aspect of social life and rearmament is almost complete. Thanks to Nazi rule, Germany's ignominious defeat in World War One has been consigned to the past. Germany is proud of its achievements. One people, one Reich, one Fuhrer. It is summer 1939. The recently completed Reich Chancellery is deserted. Architect Albert Speer has built a gargantuan structure to mirror his furious aspirations to power. But Hitler prefers to hatch his plans for the conquest of Poland at a safe distance from his capital. Berliners are all but oblivious to the fact that Europe may be on the brink of war. They are enjoying life in the Third Reich to the full, but the Halcyon Days are not far. As an airfield in Breslau in Silesia, the 77th Luftwaffe Fighter Wing is ready for combat. 27 year old Hannes Trautloft is one of its captains. The Messerschmitt 109 fighters are the pride of the German air force. Designed by engineer Willy Messerschmitt, the trim one seaters have already proven their mettle in the Spanish Civil War. For two years, Captain Trautloft was on active duty with the Condor Legion in Spain and his five kills to his record. Now he can share his combat experience with the other pilots. "The ace of hearts" squadron from Breslau is one of the first to see action in the invasion of Poland. The German unit superiority the Poland's Air Force is overwhelmed. Youth Fuhrer Baldur von Schirack is visiting Hitler at the Fuhrer's Obersalzberg chalet. Plans for the so called "Case white", the war against Poland, are almost complete. The surprise attack is to commence no later than September the first. The dictator wants to avoid an official mobilization, so reserve units are being called up for fall exercises. In early June 1939, the German police track and field championships are staged in Frankfurt. Since 1936, SS director Heinrich Himmler has also been head of the police force. His deputy, commander Kurt Daluege, is attending the games at Ostmarkt stadium on his superiors behalf, to witness the officers athletic prowess. During the course of the war, police battalions under Daluege's direct command will distinguish themselves by their utter ruthlessness in executing partisans and murdering Jewish civilians. Hand grenade throwing contests are among the game's highlights. The winner is a herr Ragner from Cologne with a distance of 260 feet. On the other side of the Atlantic, the last major international event before the outbreak of war is being held - the 1939 World's Fair in New York. The Fair attracts flocks of visitors, and a particularly regal couple in early June. King George VI of England and Queen Elizabeth are paying an official visit to the United States and stopped in New York for a courtesy call. The scandal of the king's older brother Edward VIII, relinquishing his claim to the British throne three years earlier for an # American divorcee, seems all but forgotten. The monarchy pays a gracious tribute to the New World and the New York society is captivated by their splendour. The Royal couples visit is politically explosive as well. The ceremonial laying of a wreath at George Washington's tomb is not a mere symbol of recognition for the former colony. It also demonstrates solidarity with the American allies. Shortly before, US President Franklin D. Roosevelt had angered the German dictator with the telegraph. Hitler, Roosevelt demanded, should refrain from attacks on European countries for the next 25 years. The royal visit to the United States underscores England's full agreement with these demands, the lines are drawn. It is early morning in the small community of Elbe as they do every year, contingents of workers from the German Labor Front a gathering for the harvest. But this summer, everything is different. Europeans have begun to realize that peace is dangling on the thinnest of threads. Some Germans still believe that Hitler can achieve his political objectives without bloodshed but many others are worried. Fear of an imminent conflict is rife. Memories of the horrors of World War One are only too vivid in people's minds. The battleship Gneisenau is moored in the port of Que. In service only since 1938, the flagship of the rearmed German Navy is slated for an overhaul. A new so called "Atlantic prow" is due to greatly improve the vessels seaworthiness. Before long, the Gneisenau and her sister-ship the Scharnhorst will be attacking British convoys in the northern Atlantic. Despite the preparations for war, life at Hitler's Berghof continues as before. In mid-August 1939, the dictator is summons his courtiers. Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop is among his closest advisors. The two men are playing a risky game. Ribbentrop is to sign a non-aggression pact with Stalin in Moscow, in order to rule out the risk of a potentially disastrous war on two fronts. And Nazi summer vacation program on the island of Sylt. Boys and girls of the Hitler Youth attend the morning's flag raising ceremony. A deceptive silence reigns throughout the Third Reich, things almost appear normal but the impending clash of arms rivets public attention and internal memorandum notes that: "Confidence in the Fuhrer may well now be put to the acid test". Everyone is against the wall. The American reporter William Shirer writes in his diary, "How can a country go into a major war with a population so dead set against it?" The campaign against Poland begins on September the 1st. Within a month, Wehrmacht units have overrun the western part of the country. Hitler divides the spoils with his Soviet allies. Stalin's Red Army occupies Eastern Poland. By the start of October, the fighting is already over. A German tank reserve unit conducting exercises in occupied Poland. The troops mustn't succumb to boredom after this easy victory. After all, Poland will not be the only target of Hitler's blitzkrieg strategy. Two days after the German invasion of Poland, Great Britain and France declare war against the Third Reich and begin mobilizing their troops. An American businessman, staying on the Channel Island of Guernsey, films British soldiers leaving for the front with his small camera. An air raid warning in the streets of Paris. Fearful of German air attacks, the residents practice using gas masks and making their way to air raid shelters. The whole of Europe is in a state of emergency but few can foresee how long this war will last and how many millions of human beings will lose their lives out on the battlefields and in the bomb ravaged cities. The American journalist Janet Flanner writes on that fateful day, September the 3rd: "It is these geographic elements, as well as the time now being taken by diplomats, which make this seem an unnatural war." "In point of fact, it is really a commonplace war, since it is simply a fight for liberty." "It is only because of its potential size that it may, alas, prove to be civilizations ruin." In mid-October, the American businessman manages to find a US freighter willing to risk the perilous passage across the Atlantic. After just three days at sea, he gets a firsthand taste of war. The amateur cameraman films the German submarine U-46, attacking an enemy convoy and sinking two British freighters. The American cargo ship rescue survivors from the SS Yorkshire and The City of Mandalay. The wounded officer has succumbed to his injuries. With no Union Jack on board, the body is wrapped in the Stars and Stripes and buried at sea. Hitler had originally ordered the invasion of France in mid-November, but his generals dissuade him with arguments that the enemies in the West would prove far tougher than Poland. As a result, the Fuhrer turns his attention temporarily to Scandinavia. With growing unease, the Germans watch British warships and mining vessels intensify their operations of the Norwegian coast. These maneuvers pose a threat to the Swedish iron ore shipments to Germany, most of which leave from the port of Narvik. In early 1940 Lieutenant commander Briggs is filming onboard the HMS Ivanhoe, the British cruisers mission is to seek out German submarines in the North Sea and destroy them with depth charges and naval mines. In addition, the British Navy has given the task of protecting British merchant navy vessels sailing to England. On February the 16th commander Briggs witnesses the British destroyer Cossack, seizing the German baggage vessel Altmark in the Jøssingfjord, inside Norwegian territorial waters. The German freighter was holding captured British merchant seaman. The Norwegian government's mild protests at the incident, fan German suspicions that Great Britain and Oslo are planning Norway's occupation. Similar incidents occur repeatedly during the following weeks, another German freighter, Alster is seized by the British warship near the Narvik fjord, the crew is taken prisoner. Under no circumstances is the German navy willing to surrender Norway to the British. Control of Norway not only secures vital supply lines, the country also offers ideal conditions for establishing submarine bases. From these strategic positions, Allied convoys, crossing the northern Atlantic, can be attacked at any time. Hitler had long before drawn up detailed plans for military action in the North Sea. On April the 9th 1940 operation Weserübung, the German Armed Forces invasion of Norway, is launched. The footage taken after the invasion by a German army physician with his 8 mm camera, suggests that the occupation, like that of Denmark, was peaceful. In reality, Norwegian troops have a vigorous resistance for two months. When King Haakon VII flees into exile, the National Assembly under fascist leader Vidkun Quisling places itself at the occupying power service. German cargo ships have docked at the port of Trondheim. German army units are loading them with equipment for use in their next theater of war. By May the 10th 1940, Germany's long awaited campaign in the West has begun. Hitler's troops have already overrun Belgium and Holland, surprising the French and British, who consider an invasion through the Ardennes impossible. Herman Göring’s Luftwaffe is simultaneously bombarding various targets in France and the Netherlands. Victory over the traditional enemy proves easier than expected. Allied troops are slow to respond to the German advance. On July the 20th 1940, the 58th Infantry Division captures the city of Tulle in the Rhine. After intense, house to house fighting, the center of the town is reduced to rubble. Two days later, the Franco-German armistice is signed in Compiegne near Paris, the defeated Ground Army marches into captivity. The graves of Allied soldiers at the beaches of Dunkirk. The British Expeditionary Forces narrowly escaped disaster here in May 1940. 200,000 British and 120,000 French soldiers were evacuated at the last minute across the English Channel. Face with the opportunity to wipe out the British Army, Hitler had hesitated and ordered the advance on Dunkirk to be halted. Thus the armed might have the British Empire lived to fight another day. But for now, Britain stands alone in the struggle against the Third Reich. To mark the victory the Fuhrer's personal standard is hoisted on French soil. This scene sets the tone for the UFA's first ever propaganda color film. "Artillery strikes" is the title of a film ostensibly portraying a successful attack on a section of the Maginot Line. The Wehrmacht will clearly go to any lengths to secure its reputation on Germany's film screens. Extras have been hired - to masquerade in captured French uniforms, an entire village has been professionally raised for the cameras. This is clearly not genuine frontline footage from the French campaign, the camera work would be far too difficult and dangerous. The Army Supreme Command is spared no effort or expense to present the German artillery in the right light. Artillery men blast away to their hardest content, while the medal heroes, in reality authentic Ritterkreuz recipients, recite wooden lines in simulated scenes. Gehen sofort vor zur Abwehr des feindlichen Panzerangriff. Mein Helm. Wir gleich noch was, aber dann machen wir weiter.- Jawohl. Captured French tanks serve as convenient stage props, pyrotechnics specialists contribute camera-ready explosions. Needless to say, the artillery repulses the tank attack with ease, and according to script, the enemy is routed by the superior German forces. Yet the paitent absurdities of the UFA documentary, are in fact wita reality by summer of 1940. France has been subjugated by German forces, than Paris is occupied. At the Champs-Elysees Wehrmacht units hold a military parade. Although the soldiers appear to conduct themselves with restraint, the humiliation of the French people knows no bounds. Janet Flanner writes: "Paris is now the capital of limbo." "Anybody who loved Paris, and grieves at its plight, is fortunate not to see it now, because Paris would seem hateful." Captain Friedrich Gehrke and his 23rd Infantry Division, is stationed in Montbeliard, near the French-Swiss border. Responsible for his unit supplies, he is constantly on the move around occupied France. Shortly after France surrendered, Gehrke bought a camera and Kodak color film in Paris, and now uses it to document the Dolce Vita of the occupying forces. In autumn 1940 Gehrke and his troops undertake a special mission in the unoccupied south of the country to procure wines and spirits. They traveled extensively through Bordeaux. A detour to Biarritz is of course de rigueur. SALLES d'ANGLES COGNAC These German soldiers are unconcerned that the majority of the French people despise them. They are simply enjoying the fruits of victory. After all, who knows how long it will be possible to live the life of luxury during this war. Paris, December 1940. German soldiers parading on the Champs-Élysées. The German Army officer records the scene on his small 16-millimeter film camera. France has succumbed. The conquerors have settled into the French capital. Some 20,000 Wehrmacht soldiers are in the city. The victors leave no doubt as to who is in charge now. General Rudolf von Stülpnagel is the military commandant of Paris. He conscientiously enforces the orders of the Wehrmacht Supreme Command. Since early November, all Jewish businesses have been systematically arialized. All Jews are subjected to a special compulsory registration. Those with the means and connections, flee the country. The immigrants positions are sold off in the city's flea markets. The occupying forces secure some valuables for themselves. Relics of a world religion are reduced to rubbish by dictatorship contemptuous of humanity. The losers now live behind barbed wire. 25,000 French prisoners of war have been herded into a POW camp in Aime. The sentry Hugo Filbrich captures scenes from camp life. He is especially interested in Arab and African soldiers, who end up in captivity, hailing originally from France’s colonial and African units. Who knows whether these pictures merely reflect Filbrich’s natural curiosity or the racism of Nazi ideology. The purpose of the Dachau concentration camp near Munich is clearly defined. More than 20,000 opponents of the regime, political prisoners from the occupied territories and Jews are closely guarded here by SS-units. In winter 1940, a baker from the town of Dachau shot this unique footage inside the vast camp complex. He regularly supplies bread to the camp canteen. Several of the prisoners work for him in the bakehouse. As a result, the SS-guard units evidently have no objections to his filming, even the notorious roll-call yard from a distance. These are the only known pictures of the Dachau camp, prior to its liberation in 1945. In Miami, on the other side of the Atlantic, the USS Tuscaloosa is ready to set sail in December 1940. President Franklin D Roosevelt is on board the cruiser for a two week trip to the Caribbean. Officially, the United States is adhering to a policy of neutrality. Only 8% of Americans want to enter to the war. But the recently reelected president knows only too well that his country will have to intervene sooner or later. He has therefore ordered a massive expansion of the arms industry. He is particularly concerned about Great Britain's plight and receives the new British governor of the Bahamas for an exchange of views. A few months earlier, the Duke of Windsor had been relegated to this outpost by British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. The former King Edward VIII had lived in France, following his abdication, and was widely viewed as a Nazi sympathizer. But with the German Luftwaffe of bombarding London night after night, the most Germanophile of Britain's had now lost all sympathy for Hitler. In spring 1941, the amateur film producer Rosie Newman shoots these sequences for a report about the home front. German bombs have fallen near Bond Street and caused major devastation. Over 1200 Londoners lose their lives in 1941 during these raids. Time and again Rosie Newman's position behind the camera elicits astonished reactions. The police officer, checking her permit to film, comments curtly: “I had no idea girls were used for this kind of work.” In retaliation, the Royal Air Force has begun to bomb German cities. For the first time the war which the Wehrmacht is spread over half of Europe, returns to haunt its own people. Color footage of Neuwied. The night of March the 1th. British bombers had attacked this small town on the Rhine. 12 people died during the raid. In the market square the townspeople did final farewells to the victims. As yet, no one has the least idea of the scale of terror the coming luftkrieg bombing will bring. For months, Hitler and his generals have been gearing up for their next major campaign, the war against the Soviet Union. In the meantime, however, Italy's dictator Mussolini has evidently overstretched his military capabilities. The Fuhrer dispatches Wehrmacht units to North Africa, and then to the Balkans, to support his ally. In April 1941, German troops occupy both, Yugoslavia and Greece, within a matter of weeks. The 27th Fighter wing is also attacking targets around the clock, and the Greek capital capitulates. The 6th squadron of the 2nd group is stationed to the Elefsis airport near Athens. Before returning to Germany, the soldiers take time out for sightsee, a German tank and soldiers graves, the legacy of yet another battle of Thermopylae. From their headquarters in Athens, the Germans will impose a pitiless military regime upon occupied Greece for the next three years, including shootings of hostages, and mass executions. Needless to say, none of this features in the soldiers amateur films, the conquerors are still basking in the euphoria of victory. Nazi Germany presents a picture of deceptive calm. Vacationing at Lake Grimsey in summer 1941. Orders for the war against the Soviet Union have long been issued. Propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels notes in his diary: “We are all trembling with anticipation." "I can hardly wait for the storm to break." "This evening, the new weekly news release is out. Terrific." "I'm staying in Schwanenwerder. The redolent evening, how beautiful the world can be?” The resident at number 12 Wasserburger Straße in Munich is also going on vacation in early June. Hitler's mistress Eva Braun has her sights set on Italy. As always, she takes a small camera and color film along. Chief Pilot Hans Baur personally flies the holidaymakers across the Alps. The party also includes Eva's mother, Fanny, her sister, Gretel, and the wife of Hitler's personal physician, Annie Brandt. While German troops are massing along the German-Soviet line of demarcation in Poland and Eastern Prussia, the ladies are relaxing at the seaside at Paraggi near Portofino. At dawn on June 22, 1941, operation Barbarossa is launched. From East Prussia, the 20th Panzer Division and the Central Army Group set out to invade Russia. 21 year old Kurt # is among the radio operators on duty. Some months before the photography enthusiast had scavenged a few rows of Kodak film in occupied Warsaw. Now he is shooting incredible footage of the advancing Wehrmacht. Within the space of a month, Hitler’s soldiers pushed the Red Army back deep into the Ukraine. Smolensk is no longer far, and even Moscow seems within their grasp. Hundreds of thousands of Soviet soldiers are taken prisoner. By the Fuhrer’s instructions, political commissars are to be executed immediately. All others are crowded into makeshift POW camps. Those who survive are deported to Germany to do forced labor. Fascinated by the war and its destruction, # Kurt uses his last wheel of color film in August 1941. When he later submits the film before developing, it is confiscated. However, the authorities are so impressed by his camera work that they refrain from arresting him, instead transferring him to Goebbels propaganda team's to train as a cameraman. These films of the war in the Soviet Union end with scenes of a German military cemetery. Four years later, there will be hundreds of such cemeteries, final resting places for the fallen German soldiers, lucky enough to get a burial at all. At roughly the same time, an armada of ships is lying at anchor in the port of Halifax. Here, in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia, British convoys and allied troop transports gathering for the perilous transatlantic voyage to Europe. The one sleepy town of Halifax is now a throbbing garrison center, complete with troops, support services, and nightclubs. For the last good time before frontline action overseas. In August 1941, Britain's Prime Minister Winston Churchill is visiting Canada. He will shortly be meeting US President Roosevelt to proclaim the Atlantic Charter, the new order of peace to succeed Hitler's defeat, but first, victory has to be won. Fire! - Fire! - Fire! In war, a nation must be forthright. For the Art of War is largely the ability to marshal the entire resources for people - ships, tanks, planes and guns. But for the tanks, planes and ships, men were needed and on the storied cobbles of Halifax, the tramp of armed men beater savage rhythm. War, war, war, war, war! On August the 28th, Hitler and Mussolini visit German and Italian troops in the Ukraine. The German dictator is at the zenith of his power. No potentate since Napoleon has controlled a greater part of Europe. "Russia will henceforth be ruled by German Fuhrer’s," Hitler proclaims in one of his interminable monologues. Very soon the vast territories of that country were to become living space, Lebensraum, for German settlers. From the very outset, Hitler's invasion of the East is a war of extermination against the civilian population. Scenes from the occupied town of Plyskiv in the Ukraine. Heinrich Himmler's special forces behind the front have begun their mission of extinguishing the Jewish population. Mass SS executions are the order of the day. From time to time such executions are also carried out by regular army troops. In the war against Starlin the Wehrmacht loses the last vestiges of its self-respect. Kirovograd in the Ukraine has been under German occupation since August the 5th 1941. Pioneer Battalion 219 is quartered nearby. For many years, Pioneer Voight has been a keen amateur photographer, and so he shoots footage of his unit at work, and at play. Their job is to repair bridges behind the frontlines. These are not propaganda reels, but rather candid shots of a war that will turn into a nightmare for these soldiers within a few weeks’ time. The German advance will soon be halted, not by Stalin's armies, but by the bitter cold. The Pioneer Battalion erects log cabins, a shelter against the harshness of the Russian winter. Hitler's war on the Eastern Front is slow to a halt by the mud, ice and snow. Hawaii, February 1942. For some weeks now this small island paradise in the Pacific, there's been no war is focus of attention. On December the 7th 1941 Japanese warplanes had attacked the US military base at Pearl Harbor, wreaking havoc. Hickam airfield was transformed into a gigantic scrapyard. 77 US aircrafts were destroyed here by the aggressives. 29 Japanese planes shut down by the air defense units. America is now at war with both, Imperial Japan and Nazi Germany, and is promptly preparing to strike back. Troops are dispatched to Honolulu and the battleships, damaged in the attack, speedily repaired. On behalf of the US Secret Service, the OSS, Hollywood # Dwyane John Ford has come to Pearl Harbor to make a film. He and his camera teams witness America's preparations for war. Hawaii, these days, is truly a strange place. Ford reports in a letter: “Barbed wire everywhere, belated safety measures of all kinds." "The hysteria of this defensive mood is very confusing to me.” On board the USS Hornet, Admiral William Halsey set sail for Japan. His unit had escaped the disaster of Pearl Harbor. Now the aircraft carriers receive orders to get as close as possible to the Japanese mainland, so that US planes can bomb Tokyo. The plan succeeds, but the head of the Japanese fleet Yamamoto is already planning his next coup. He aims to capture the US military base on the island of Midway with a surprise attack, but the Americans have cracked his codes and are now lying in wait for the Japanese fleet. In the Battle of Midway in June 1942 the US takes revenge for Pearl Harbor and turns the tide in the Pacific. Two weeks earlier, John Ford and his cameraman Jack Mackenzie were dispatched to Midway by orders from the top. Their job is to cover the battle. They position themselves with their cameras on the roof of the power plant and from there on the morning of June the 4th shoot incredible scenes. John Ford is wounded, he is decorated with the Purple Heart and earns an Oscar for his documentary, “The Battle of Midway.” TRAINING WOMEN FOR WAR PRODUCTION By now, the American arms industry is in full swing, the men away fighting the war, women take over the factories and 1942 propaganda film that claims of virtues of this solution. And First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt personally assumes patronage of the campaign. At the present time, it is of paramount importance that the women and girls of our country be given training, so that they may do their share in the war emergency. To some of us the National Youth Administration stands out as the agency, which is doing the best job along these lines, at present. Despite the setback suffered by the Japanese, the American population remains vigilant. There are fears of Japanese air assaults, and the authorities are even worried that the Germans too might eventually muster a direct attack on the United States. The training film explains the steps to be taken, should such an emergency occur. “Our school prepares for air raids.” There should not be time to reach the air raid room. Pupils are taught quick ways of self-protection. The school offers many such places of refuge, which boys and girls should learn how and when to use. What's the fate of these young children be that a thousands in the conquered lands? The answer is no. Therefore, let us prepare ourselves for anything to come, from the superintendent down to the pupils in the school. All must help, let us join the triumphant march toward victory. The parade in honor of the Fuhrer in Linz, Austria, previously unseen color footage from a private collectors archive. The entire town has turned out to celebrate Adolf Hitler's birthday on April the 20. Disabled soldiers are in the front row. Boys and girls from the Hitler Youth are assembled for the occasion. Tributes are paid to Hitler by local dignitaries. Linz proudly calls itself the patron city of the Fuhrer. Hitler spent most of his youth in Linz and after the final victory, he plans to retire here. The monumental buildings have already been designed in anticipation of that day. Nazi dignitaries still stand firmly by their leader, the most of them will fanatically persevere to the bitter end. It's the summer of 1942 in the Greater German Reich, but tourist films a legendary “White horse” inn that's in Wolfgang lake. Most Germans are still confident of a happy end, notwithstanding the infrequent victory bulletins from Russia and North Africa. But there's one thing the propaganda can't disguise this up. More and more families are being notified of the heroic deaths of their husbands, fathers and sons. Now that the Americans have joined the Allied effort, the air attacks on Berlin have greatly increased in severity. These scenes of cleanup work, following an air raid, was shot surreptitiously. Filming such subjects is strictly forbidden, and a punishable offense. These are rare, uncensored documents of the war on the German homefront. At the end of July 1942, the Southern army group launches a major offensive in the Ukraine. Hitler has ordered his armed forces to advance to the river Don in a lightning strike, and then proceed to the Caucasus. War correspondent # Hans is covering the action. On special instruction from the Ministry of Propaganda, he shoots the German advance on 35 millimeter color film. Among his reports are some moving portraits of captured Red Army soldiers. Seals a victory and defeat, the war and destruction, yet only a handful of these will pass Goebbels strict censorship. In August, the German offensive is halted by the Red Army. # Hans shoots combat scenes featuring the tank reconnaissance unit number three motorcycle #. Although these pictures are intended exclusively for propaganda purposes, they do reveal the true state of Hitler's armed forces. Stalingrad is not far away. From now on these soldiers will suffer one defeat after another. Hitler's heinous war is irretrievably lost. For months the city of Kharkov in the Ukraine is a site of intense fighting until its liberation by the Red Army in August 1943. Civilians suffer and food is scarce under German occupation. Fresh supplies are few and far between. For German soldiers on the other hand, nothing is lacking. There is plenty of recreation for the troops in the barracks. Films are shown to be raised the day to day horrors of the war, if only for a few hours. The film's include a revue, featuring dancers Margot and Heidi Hoepfner, filmed in 1942 by Georg Jacobi, the husband of actress Marika Rökk a soldier's dream. Meanwhile, in reserve hospital in Bielefeld, and unknown army physician documents the brutal reality of war, the rehabilitation of amputee Wehrmacht soldiers. Amputees sports program and the precise fitting of the leg prostheses seemed to fascinate the amateur photographer. The usual precision German engineer. Although the scenes of disabled soldiers may seem innocuous, they are in fact highly eloquent, and damning testimonials to the madness of war. All the while the Allied enemy is already rehearsing its invasion. Here, American Marines are storming an unknown stretch of coastline and a large scale practice offensive. For months, they have been preparing to capture enemy strongholds in Europe and the Pacific.

He evidently still had 16 millimeter color film material at his disposal, and was able to shoot these red pictures of the German anti-aircraft defenses. Unlike the British, the American bomber squadrons have more reason to fear the German anti-aircraft guns. They fly their missions during the day. The B-24 bomber squadron is stationed at Berca airfield in Libya. This unit attacks strategic targets in southern Germany and Austria. While the British forces have specialized in the carpet bombing of major German cities, the US Air Force concentrates on industrial areas. The mission of these flying fortresses of the 376 Bomber Squadron is to disable the aircraft production plants in Regensburg and Wiener Neustadt, crippling Hermann Goering’s Luftwaffe. Fewer and fewer regular soldiers are available for air-raid defense. Starting in 1943, men previously classified as unfit for service, are increasingly drafted, along with children. The Nazis have no qualms about sending 16 and 17 year old schoolboys to the flak batteries as Luftwaffe helpers. From a height of 23,000 feet, bombers drop their deadly cargo, high explosive, incendiary and fragmentation bombs, hundreds and thousands of them. By the end of the war, the Americans alone will have dropped almost 2 million tons of bombs over Europe to bring the German war-machine to a standstill.

Shortly after 11am, a special American unit scouring the Atlantic in search of U-boats had located the enemy submarine and forced it to surface with depth charges. First Lieutenant Harald Lange and his crew of 58 men are taken captive. Under heavy fire, the crew had desperately tried to set off explosive charges mounted to the keel of the submarine to keep their boat and the codebooks from falling into enemy hands.

US war correspondent Jack Lieb with a small camera and color film in his backpack, lands on the green beach sector of Utah Beach. Here the Allies have met with less stubborn resistance. The Germans had manned the bunkers and trenches largely with Wehrmacht mercenaries from Georgia and the Ukraine. The very day of the invasion, Hitler had still dismissed the attack as a diversionary maneuver, and insisted that the main allied offensive would be launched at Calais. The Wehrmacht’s Panzer divisions have thus been ordered to maintain their positions there. Coast guard camera teams are also busy recording the events of D-day and the days following the landing. They've been detailed to work under Hollywood legend John Ford, who is planning a feature documentary, but most ticks do not even get past the censors and the ambitious project falls prey to bureaucratic red tape. What remains of the film are a few highly evocative fragments.

More than anything else, this film reveals a Wehrmacht’s impotence at this stage of the conflict. The tide of Goebbels’s total war is now turning against the Germans. This is seldom palpable on the home front, even in the summer of 1944. A dip in the water and Dachau near Munich, filmed by local baker. Despite the unavoidable concessions of wartime, the baker has little reason to complain. After all, business has been booming for some years now. He has excellent connections to the huge concentration camps, situated just a few hundred yards away. As a member of the German association of amateur film enthusiasts, he is among the few who still have access to color film, he uses some of it to document a club excursion to Dachau. It may be that the soccer players, inadvertently captured by the camera, are SS camp guards. Time to relax over a meal of roasted goose. This evening, like every other evening tens of thousands of starving inmates at Dachau will report for roll call. On August 22nd, US commander in chief Dwight D. Eisenhower gives orders for general clerks French second tank division to capture Paris. Hollywood director George Stevens has permission to record the event with his camera team.

Wehrmacht soldiers help Aryan maidens with the grape harvest. Meanwhile, the Allies have already crossed the German border near Aachen. The demise of the Third Reich is only a matter of time. The language used in the newsreel betrays an inadvertent cynicism, the superb vintage. In East, Stalin's Red Army has overrun Romania and advanced into Hungary, where Wehrmacht soldier Helmut Ritke shoots this amateur footage of armored personnel carriers. Today these scenes of the war seem almost unreal, rare documents of the decline and fall of the Third Reich. Meanwhile, the big three are negotiating the fate of post Hitler Germany. On February the 4th, 1945, US President Roosevelt joins Prime Minister Churchill and the Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin in Yalta. They lay down a new order for Europe. The conference at Yalta was intended as a tribute to liberty but in the end, the terminally ill Roosevelt accepts Stalin's control over Eastern Europe in exchange for the Soviet Union's agreement to enter the war against Japan, following German capitulation. Some months now, the Japanese have been wielding an extraordinary weapon in a desperate attempt to halt the Americans advance - the Kamikazes. Named after the mythical divine women, the fearful typhoon that destroyed the fleet of the Mongol ruler, Kublai Khan, Japanese suicide pilots target and sync enemy aircraft carriers and battleships. They cause extensive damage. The Inferno onboard the aircraft carrier USS Ticonderoga, filmed on January the 21st, 1945 by US Navy cameraman. The kamikazes can only temporarily stay the inevitable. The Americans have vastly superior arms. The Marines capture island after island in the Pacific, shouldering staggering losses. On February the 19th, 1945, 30,000 GIs land southwest of Iwo Jima. The Japanese have rendered the uninhabited volcanic island an impregnable fortress. The Commandant was made to swear an oath of non-capitulation to the Emperor and the Japanese put up a terrible fight. Iwo Jima has gone down in history as one of the bloodiest battles of World War Two. Nearly 7000 GIs were killed and 17,000 wounded. For weeks the fierce battle of Iwo Jima rages on, the Americans must fight each step of the way. Because the Japanese have entrenched themselves in a network of subterranean tunnels, the Marines camera team shoots spectacular scenes. No Japanese is to die without having killed at least 10 Americans, Lieutenant General Kuribayashi has told his soldiers. We shall fight the enemy with guerrilla warfare until every last one of us is dead. Out of 22,000 Japanese soldiers barely 1000 survived or taken prison. For the first time, the stars and stripes are raised on Japanese soil. By March the 23rd, 1945, Allied troops have crossed the Rhine, American tanks are advancing toward Kassel, the German Wehrmacht is virtually defeated. US Air Force camera teams accompanied the advancing troops to shoot a color documentary. Although the film is never completed, the footage captures unique scenes of an end and the beginning. The fall of Nazi dictatorship and a new life, rising from the ruins of the 1000-year Reich. The American journalist Martha Gellhorn notes at the time, “No one is a Nazi. No one ever was." "We had enough of this government, they say." "We welcome the Americans, we do not fear them." "We have no reason to fear, we have done nothing wrong, we are not Nazis.” On April the 8th, US troops reached the Ohrdruf concentration camp in Thuringia, and are faced with a ghastly site. The Germans had initially evacuated the camp, abandoning scores of sick inmates. Then marauding SS units returned and left behind a horrifying bloodbath. The soldiers are appalled by the grisly discovery, then they learn of a sudden death of their president. On April the 15th, the casket of Franklin D Roosevelt is drawn in procession through the streets of Washington.

The Wehrmacht commander in chief evade responsibility by committing suicide in the Chancellery bunker in Berlin. His soldiers surrender to the Allies in droves. Dachau was the first concentration camp, built by the Nazis in spring of 1933. Now, at the end of April 1945, it is the last camp to be liberated by the allies. In the course of a dozen years 200,000 human beings were confined here, 32,000 died. For the camp inmates the final weeks were a race against time, and the imminent threats of starvation, death marches and mass executions. Thousands were too weak to hold on until help came. Shocked George Stevens and his camera team record these scenes on film. The Americans rush to provide bread rations and establish hygienic conditions to avert the spread of disease. Some of the guards seek anonymity among the inmates, to escape a rest, but in vain. They are quickly identified by their former victims and turned over to the US military authorities. Others were less fortunate, after the camps were liberated, they were lynched by incensed inmates or unceremoniously shot by outrage GIs. On May the 8th 1945, the Wehrmacht surrenders unconditioned. The Third Reich has ceased to exist. It is Germany's zero hour, marking the end of the Nazis and the beginning of new hope. Great Britain rejoices, the Nazis are defeated. It is victory very little time of # gate set. There will always be in England, the people of this neighborhood of blazing on their balance. In his radio address to the nation, Winston Churchill will seek to mute his people's euphoria with a somber admonition.

Only hours before his scheduled execution, he evades death on the gallows by taking a cyanide capsule. 268 death sentences against German war criminals are carried out in the American zone alone. In the town of Bruchsal near Heidelberg, a convict in the so called pilot trials takes his final walk. Fanatical Nazis, who murdered downed US pilots in violation of the Geneva Convention, are call to account for their crimes. On June the 24th 1945, the Soviet Union officially celebrates victory over Nazi Germany with a parade on Red Square in Moscow. For days Red Army soldiers have rehearsed the ceremony of presenting war trophies to their ruler. In 1941, Joseph Stalin had issued his call to arms for the Great Patriotic War against the invaders, and he had won it shoulder to shoulder with the allies. More than 20 million Soviet citizens lost their lives in the process. Mounted on a white horse, the victor of Berlin Marshall Georgy Zhukov receives his soldiers homage. This victory has firmly placed the Soviet Union among the major powers. Stalin is fully resolved to extend his sphere of influence to include all of Europe. On July the 14th 1945, the new American President Harry S. Truman arrives at Gatow Airport in Berlin. He is welcomed by the Soviet’s deputy foreign minister, Andrey Vyshinsky. The victors will deliberate Germany's destiny at the Potsdam Conference. Already the distrust between the allies is greater than their common interests. The German journalist Ruth Andreas-Friedrich still has hopes for a unified Democratic Germany. “If they understand and forgive us now, we will give them everything they want." "Everything. We will forswear Nazism, we will prefer the new to the old." "We will work hard and harbor no ill will.” American camera teams eagerly explore Soviet occupied Berlin, Hitler's bombed out Chancellery. The faces of those who won the final battle against the Third Reich. For several days now, the British and the Americans have taken control of their respective sectors. That Berlin is not a divided city, not yet. Ruth Andreas-Friedrich notes in her journal in July 1945: “Never before were we so ripe for redemption and so tired of terror, fear and injustice. If only the victors keep their promises to us.” Photo up at the end of one era, and the dawn of another. Truman, Stalin and Churchill, that the Sicilian Half Palace Gardens in Potsdam. It is the last gathering of the former wartime coalition that is no longer a common ground to erect plans for peace. A short year later, Winston Churchill will speak of the “iron curtain” that has descended to divide Europe. The Cold War blasts the hopes of many but World War Two is by no means over. The Japanese is still maintaining their fierce resistance. The Soviet Union is ready to declare war against the Nippon Empire and forging plans for an invasion that are never to be implemented. Mostly in Potsdam, the American delegation learns of the successful testing of an atomic bomb. US President Truman does not hesitate for long. On August the 6th 1945, an atomic blast destroys Hiroshima. Three days later, an Airforce cameraman films the explosion of a second bomb over Nagasaki. Japan capitulates unconditionally. World War Two is brought to an end by a weapon of inconceivable destructive power. From this moment on, mankind has the potential to annihilate human civilization, along with its entire history.
