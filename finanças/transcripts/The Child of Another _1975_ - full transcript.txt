TO MY MOTHER, TO THE MOTHER OF MY CHILDREN, "NO COMBAT IS IN VAIN" in THE CHILD OF ANOTHER The Ngondo feast takes place every year in Douala. The Ngondo means the umbilical cord that binds the people to their original values. This year, the Ngondo tries to reach young people who are losing faith in tradition. This is dangerous for all of us. We must react! Go away! Go away! Ancestors who are listening to me. Today my daughter Ndom? is emancipated. She wants to get married. Elders, please accept this wine as a symbol of the union between these two young people and their families. And you, the suitor, listen! The Hare said to the daring Antelope: "if you see me sitting, that means I'm sitting." My daughter, you've learned from us that, in marriage, one plus one equals one. Be a worthy daughter of your ancestors! Don't take after those vain, fashionable girls, seeking short-lived luxuries. Drink! Drink! Give it to the right person. Brothers, when we cast our nets, we don't know what we're going to catch. If it's a manatee, the whole community is happy. There's no better catch than a marriageable daughter. I don't know if the suitor will prove equal to the ask, because I had a hard time marrying the mother and bringing up the girl. Too many problems for one person. Costs keep going UP- My fishermen aren't catching anything lately, because the white man's boats are fishing in our own rivers. Our own black brothers are the ones who encourage this state of affairs, thus reducing us to poverty. And prices are running wild. Two kilos of fish won 7 e ven buy a kilo of rice. Not to mention the countless taxes... What's more, Ngando wants to get married. H0 w can I make him understand that I must ha ve a child before, and therefore need a 5th wife? However, this time, I'll have to find a very young one, a virgin. Above all a virgin, if I want to have my child. Mbella! Hurry UP! Can't a man even relieve himself in peace? I'm in a hurry. So shut up. You make me nervous. Waiting makes me nervous. What did you eat? That's enough from you! Now I can't do anything. I'm a bundle of nerves. Ants in your pants, lover boy? If Ndom? was waiting for you, it wouldn't be ants that you'd have. You're not close to getting rid of them, though... I'm in no hurry. You mean that Ndom?'s not in a hurry. Her honor must be shown on a white sheet stained with her blood. And for that to happen, you'll have to pay a colossal dowry, which you don't have. I've got the dowry, all right. You must be joking. How did you get it? My uncle will give it to me, you ass! He promised me he would. Your uncle! Aren't you ashamed that your uncle is buying you a wife? What else can I do? Everything I bring in belongs to my family and comes under my uncle's authority as head of the family. Until I come of age. In other words, until the day I have a wife and my own home. Besides, my uncle inherited all of my father's possessions, including my mother, his second wife and me. I'm thirsty! Do you hear me? Something to drink! Tired, huh? That's the way it goes when one gets interested in a woman. Look at mine. I wore myself out for them, spent all my money to marry them, and for what? They can't even satisfy me. I've got four wives. Four wives, and not one child. Four wives, all barren, all witches. See how they look at me? I'm the lowest of the low. Uncle. Is a child that important? Why do you think one gets married? No matter how powerful a man is, he is nothing without a child. A child is everything! A child! If only I could have a child. One child! This is what these witches have reduced me to. Come here, you stupid good-for-nothings! Clear up this mess right now! Look at that one. I married her myself. Barren! Your father bought that one for me. She's an idiot, and barren as well. That one's calamity personified. Unfaithful, idiotic and barren. And your father's bequeathment. Your own mother has become unproductive too. So it's normal for him to give me my due. It's his duty as head of the family. To tell the truth, I don't like it much. Then he'll have a say about your married life. Never! How can you help it? Your wife will make it clear. A wife belongs to he who pays her dowry. You can't repudiate a wife without your uncle's consent. I'll never do that! Never! Ndome is my woman. I'll run my own home as I please. I haven't reached that point yet. I have to marry Ndom? first. No matter how. - Did you see that? - See what? Your uncle's second wife. She was with a man! I saw her with a man! They're gone! But I saw them as they were. Rotten woman! She'll get another good beating today. That's not my problem. Wives cost so much, but aren't worth a penny of trust. - They're all - - Shut up! Now, what did I say wrong? Listen to me. I don't spy on my uncle's wives. Apart from my mother, the only woman I care about is Ndom?. I won't allow anyone to call her any names. Let me go meet her now. Dear Uncle, I am pleased to introduce my future wife. Miss Ndom?. Say hello. Say hello to my uncle. Say hello to him! Come closer. Closer than that. Not that way. Come on. Gently. Bow your head shyly. Remember, even though he looks young, he's got four wives. Come on. He'll get up from his chair... draw you towards him, make a minute inspection... He'll get slapped too, if he touches my behind. If you slap my uncle like that - He'd better not touch me there. I feel a bit uneasy about meeting your uncle. I felt the same way meeting your mother. She's a terrific mother. She'll soon be yours, too. I can hardly wait. I think we'll get on very well. But she loves you too much. Jealous? I don't want to share you with anyone, not even your mother. But she's my mother, after all! And so? - So down you go! - No,no! - Right here! - My dress! - I'll put you down. - No,no! - I'll put you down. - No, I said! I want you all to myself, do you hear? - Does it hurt much? - Yes. My left foot. A bad sign. You're such a pessimist. Let me see. Nothing serious. Uncle, here's Ndom?. Let us have a word, alone. Come closer. Don't be afraid. Come closer. Don't be afraid. You're lovely. Trust me. Yes, I slapped him. He deserved it. But after that slap, he'll never give me the dowry. Now I'll have to earn it myself. It'll take a long time. I'll wait for you forever. I'm very sorry for my uncle. He doesn't have any children. I'll give you several. The women in my family have lots of children. My mother had six. I'm the only daughter. How many would you like? Several. But let's wait until we're married. We'll work together for the dowry. We'll make it. To hell with your uncle's money. My uncle's an idiot. Nd0me"s parents are idiots. The people who in vented the do w/y custom were complete idiots. Not to mention those who accept it. I'm an idiot too, because I can't change this custom. Look what you're reduced to doing. Cutting wood in order to be able to marry me. Darling, you're exhausted. I hope he won't be worn out when he's finally mine. I'm working myself to death for you, little one. But you're worth it. If you knew how much it pains me, you killing yourself this way. But I must admit that I'm proud that you're doing it for me. The cassava and fish were stolen from my mother. Watch out if! catch you looking at another woman! One for you, one for me. Two for you, two for me. Three for you, three for me. Four for you, four for me. Five for you, five for me. - Six for you, six for me. - Nd0m?./ - Ndome'! Ndome'! - Seven for you, seven for me. Where are you? We're going home. Ngando. Why do you refuse to understand? Ndom?'s my only hope for a child. I'll give you two wives in exchange. Give her up, or I'll disinherit you. Answer when I speak to you! You're just selfish. You'll never get her. A woman is like an ear of corn. He who has teeth will get to eat her. Where will you find 100,000 francs, 4 cases of whiskey, 20 goats, 10 demijohns of red wine, 20 liters each, 5 sacks of rice, 100 kilograms each, 15 large-size bottles of St. James rum, one 7-meter-long dugout, 60 sacks of kitchen salt, 18 kilograms each, 3O kilograms of loose-leaf tobacco, 25 bolts of printed cloth, 6 yards each, 100 liters of palm oil, and 3 cases of household soap? Cheaper than cheap, cheaper than cheap goods! Everything must 90! Yes, sir? - How much? -400 francs. -400 francs? -400 francs, yes. - Expensive. - Very pretty! - This one's silver. - How much? 300 francs. 300? I'll give you 250. Sold for 275. Let's talk seriously. It's flattering for Ndom? to have another fianc?. Besides, it could be to your advantage. You must seize the chance, Dipoko, my friend. I'm hesitating because Ngando is your nephew. Come, come! He's young and penniless! Ndom? is my only hope of becoming a father. What will Ndom? say? She has no say. She'll just obey! To help you make up your mind. You must think of yourself. Ngando is young. He must wait his turn. Today, money is power. I'll be very grateful. This is for you. And this is for her. This is what I've decided. Mbongo, my friend. My decision is irrevocable. Take his gift! Take his gift! Take his gift! There's only one law here, mine! - Try to understand her. - Am I clear? Make her come back, immediately! Ndom? will marry who I want her to. Go away now. Hurry up, the two of you! Ndom?. This is for you. If you want her, bring the dowry. Ndom?. What's got into you? You think I'll bend to your will? I'm your father and you'll obey me! Ngafido? Ngando, take me right now. What? Are you out of your mind? Be realistic. I don't say it just because of you. I suffer too much. When I'm no longer a virgin, your uncle won't want me any more. Father will give me to you for a decent price. He'll beat me, curse me, but I'll do anything for you. It's the only way out. It's a serious decision. Why don't we go away? Where to? They'd find us anywhere. Without a dowry, my children won't be yours. I'll get the dowry. I swear! You've been vomiting for two months. I'm not sick, Mother. Stop telling me that. I want the truth. I must have the truth. I demand the truth! I'm your mother. I didn't do it to disobey you. I had no other way out. I'm pregnant. What? - By Ngando. - What? Your father will kill us both! Silence, you bitch! You shame me! That's why you're sick. I'm ashamed to have given birth to a daughter like you. You're a woman, you should understand. I'm no woman like you! I was a virgin when I married. My family was proud to show my virtue and honor to everyone. That's why your father and everyone respects me. - Ngando will be proud. - Shut up! No man will want you like this. Ngando's nothing but a thief, a penniless seducer. We'll get the dowry. Shut up! I'll fix it with some herbs. Mbongo won't notice a thing. I will never marry Ngando's uncle. Go away! The sheet of my husband's 5th wife is not stained. Somebody else got to her first! It seems it was Ngando. It also seems she's going to have a baby. That's why the sheets aren't bloodstained! Ngando, do you deserve that woman more than your uncle? Who will make her happier, and let her fulfill her role in our family? Ngando. Damned by the youngster who disrespects the elders. His own children will spit on him. It's the law of revolt. Yesterday, today, what's the difference? Everything starts again tomorrow. Listen to your mother and obey me, as usual. I'm not dead. Hear my voice. I'm your father. I live in the object you touch, in the being who approaches you. Don't cry, my son. Sorrow fortifies the soul and strengthens the character. Don't deny your initiation. Do you know what state you're in, my son? Ngandog I'd have behaved differently. - How? - I'd have gone away. Far away! It's all unfair. It's true. I feel like going away. Like going away! And even like raising hell! But would that give me back my child? And then, there's also my mother. What are you going to do now? I dream only of killing him. Hey! That's no solution! Put these on. - I said put these on! - She's not your child. She's not your child. - Here he is, here he is! - He's coming! Bring him here! Ngandog Are you out of your mind? Take me with you. You're really crazy! Still, I want to go with you. Where can I take you? I don't even know where I'm going. No matter, as long as we are together with our child. - This is crazy. - She's right. Shut up, Mbella! She belongs in the village with her husband. Yes, I know. But one can't stand unfairness throughout one's life. We have always obeyed. They should listen to us too. Here! Go! Don't waste time. You should have left a long time ago. We'll never go back to the village. I promise you. Never! You're wrong, my friend! No! Bastard! Take them back to the village. Get up! - Quick! - No! Take them back! COURT OF LAW
