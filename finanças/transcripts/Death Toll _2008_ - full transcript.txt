Councilwoman. Little early for lunch,huh, Chief? Never too early when yourstomach tells you it's time. Now what's so goddamn importantthat a man can't finish hisshrimp po boy sandwich? Well, Chief, I'm sureyou're aware that as anassistant U.S. Attorney, my responsibilityis first and foremostthe U.S. government, correct? These grilled tomatoesare so fresh. Do you want a piece? Listen, Newsome, I normallylike to keep my interactionwith you down to one minute. I'll tell it to you straight.I've already had thisdiscussion with Mayor Padial. The killingsare making the news. All of the national outletsare now doing stories. This has got to stop. I'm getting pressuredfrom the U.S. Attorney, who's getting his ass chewedout by the Congressmanthat put him there, who's getting his asschewed out by thebusinesses that put him there. This isn't good. Chief, this isn't good for you. Shit flows downhill,and you're standing in a ditch. [clears throat] Chief, we've hadthis discussion. This city's on pace to bethe murder capitalof the United States. That means tourists won't comehere because they are scared, and that means no revenue. The seasoning on these things, it's gotta be Zatarain's. You know I can tastethe difference. But the real ongoing issue hereis the drug wars. Um, you know, these two guysare responsible for 80% of the all the killingsthat happen in New Orleans'metropolitan area. On the left isCarmello Williams. On the right isRichard "Tonk" Anderson. Now, the Mexicans,the Russians, they're bringingthe stuff in here. These are the guys that arebringing it to the ghetto. These are the guys that aredistributing it all out. But they also have a supplier. His name is Richard Tobias,or aka The Dominican. Now, this guy's a heavyweightin South America and I believehe's supplying both of them, but he's also got an unknownsource that he gets it from. Who? They call him The Dog.Um, we have nothing on him. No pictures, no info,no nothin'. This guy is makingten million dollars a month right under our damn noses. [Councilwoman] Unbelievable. But the real deal with thekillings between these two guysis about drug money and turf. You don't wantsome of these fries? Look, y'all had Tonk inon a murder rap becausesome ole botched police work. Y'all screwed upand let him slip. The FEDS won't let him slip. What happened? Witnesses disappeared. Look, it happens sometimes.You DEA punks wouldn'thave done any better. You can go to hell.

Special Agent Sax, you workwith your little friendsand you get me a conviction. Not a parking ticket.I want a felony conviction. I'm gonna ride Tonk andCarmello's asses all the wayto the judge's seat. If you gentlemen will excuseme, I have real work to do. This department is a joke.Y'all are a goddamn joke. We are doing our bestto save lives--- Can one of you go out there and get me some chipsfrom the vending machine? Mr. Mayor, with all duerespect, your team's like a--the bad news bears.

[straw slurping] You think I like sitting therelookin' like a fool? Huh? You bring these two men in witha solid case against them.This killing stops now. Just three days ago,university researchers, in cooperationwith law enforcement,fired weapons with blanks. In fact, researchers fireda total 700 rounds in a sevensquare mile area dubbed law enforcement--"The Hot Zone." Amazingly, there were no callsto 911 reporting shots firedor any other incidents. New Orleans residents arereluctant to come forward aswitnesses, fearing retaliation. And experts say that is one ofseveral reasons why homicidesare on the rise in The Big Easy at a time when othercities are seeing theirmurder rate plummet at levels not seen in decades. I'm here witha New Orleans resident. How do you feelabout those murders? Well, my heart goes outto the police officers. They're fighting public apathy,racial division, and thisdysfunctional court system. They work their hearts outand nothing ever happens. No one goes to jail for murder. In fact, one out of four peoplearrested in this city for murder areeventually convicted. That number may comeas a shock to many, but events of thepast month have openedthe eyes of many locals. Residents in this cityare even calling thisrash of recent homicides "The Bloody May Murders." Reporting for channel 13, I'm Jennifer Fowleron the beat. [cell phone ringing] You gonna answer that?
