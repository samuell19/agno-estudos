Good kids! What do you want? Move! Don't be afraid, someone will come to save us soon. It'll be alright, don't cry. Lieutenant Li, your wife and son are in the bus. Got it. Kids, don't cry. Don't cry. It's like the blackmail case that happened in the shopping center last month. I think it's done by the same gang. The metallic wires are connected to the bottom of the bus, and the explosive power must be very strong. What do the criminals want? They have kidnapped three kids from rich families. Their fathers are billionaires in HK and Singapore. From each they demand 5 million US dollars. Lieutenant... We have no time. Follow me. Lieutenant! On the floor! This is a landmine of the US Army. - Papa, please save us. - Kit, you must be very careful. Don't touch those metallic wires. It'll cause an explosion. Check the time. This looks easy. It's done on purpose to make us get careless. You're kidding! It's very simple. - Just cut the yellow wire. - It won't be that simple. Give me the magnifying glass. This tiny metallic wire would be cut too. The one who designed this bomb must be a genius. I would call him a bastard. Let me try. Alright, remove the third piece of the circuit board. Do you understand now? The main wire is here! Bastard. One of it will cut the electric supply. And the other one will kill all of us. If we cut the wrong one, it'll explode. It's like flipping a coin, isn't it? Lieutenant Li! Lieutenant Li! The criminal wants to talk to you alone. Papa! Papa! Don't leave us alone. I won't leave you. Kit, you have to be careful. I will save you. Are you Kit Li? You may call me doctor. What do you want? I've collected the money. I called to see whether you have been killed or not. You must have discovered the tiny wire by now, haven't you? There's no time left, so tell me which wire to cut? Red or blue? You still have time. Guess it. Time's running short. I beg you! Have mercy on them! Mercy? I killed so many enemies in the war, but I wasn't treated like a hero. I was treated as a nobody! Who has mercy on me? We only have ten seconds left. Only those who didn't fight in the war were promoted. For the sake of humanitarianism, please tell me. Is it the red one? A man should rely on himself. Doctor! Cut the red wire! It's alright. Papa saved us. It's alright. Papa, it's alright! Granny, let me help you. Thank you. You're such a nice guy. You're welcome. My family! After bomb squad member Kit Li's wife and son were killed, he quit his job and disappeared. Two years later, he appeared in Hong Kong. Everyone please dismount. I'm here to shoot Frankie's stunt. He jumps in each of his movies. He says he needs no double. That's why he's so highly paid. The audience love to see him risking his head and his legs. Come on, put him here. Frankie... Big Brother! He must have drunken too much. I will check whether he uses a double. Alright! See you, OK, bye. Did you see them? To be honest, I saw them. You are honest. - Why don't we use a double? - Nuts! Frankie never uses a double! If someone finds out, it'll be a disaster! Frankie! Frankie! I'm alright! I can drink another bottle. Pretty women, come here. It's me, I am Charlie. Of course I know you, I know you, Charlie. Why don't you wear some new pants? So disgusting! Get a double at once. Kit. What's the matter? Why are you sitting there? Come down quickly. Why are so many people here? Why are so many people here? - I don't know. - Let me do it. If this gets found out, I'll lose face. Let's do it like we did it in Canada. Good idea. Move a bit over. Hold it tightly! Got it? Zoom tightly... a close up! Come on, jump! Pay attention, I'll jump now. I am coming! He's jumping, he's jumping! Papa! Don't leave me alone. Kit, be careful. Thank you. Thank you. Frankie asked you to be his double again? He doesn't feel well. He drinks and fools around day and night. Less than 20% of his Kung-fu is left. My son is losing his memory. He forgets that he owes his wealth and fame to Kung-fu. Uncle, he will regain his power after a little practice. Cut! Rewind! This guy doesn't seem to be Frankie. He is a bit short, and he doesn't look like Frankie too. You think he is a double? Check again. Stop! Did you see? Frankie is running in now. I'm willing to bet with you! Frankie said he'd never use a double for dangerous stunts, but you discovered his secret. I've got an idea. We will show this on the anniversary of our TV station and bust his bubble. Great! That's great. Until then, we should tail him day and night. This is a perfect plan. He has a bodyguard. Don't underestimate him. We are well-educated, we won't do that. Let's do this! Kit, come in and have fun with us. No thanks. I don't like swimming. Who says "swimming"? We'll play with the girls. These girls are sexy idols. I have to go out on patrol. How is it? Got it? Yes. - Good. - Sure. Be careful. I'll go down first. Thank you. You are secretly filming other people's live? Give me the tape. Didn't you secretly watch us shooting? Miss, don't be ridiculous, or you will suffer. Give me the tape. If you have guts, come and take it. Don't force me. So what? Sorry. Sorry for offending you. Are you alright? Remember, I will take revenge on my TV show. Go, or I will let the dogs out. I am so scared! Don't pay attention to him. Fatty, where are you? I am in the car now. Move! Bastard! I'll remember what you've done! Do you have the camera? Don't worry, it's on my shoulder. What's the matter? Does Madonna want to sleep with me? There is a jewel show. It will be held in the penthouse of the newly opened Grandeur Hotel. Only 100 VIPs will be invited. What jewels? Precious ones? They are the jewels of a 18th Century Russian Tzar. Those jewels will be put in three high tech display boxes. They are controlled by a computer and bullet-proof. If someone opens them without the computer code, they'll explode! Any woman guests? The most pretty and high classed women will be invited. It's a proof of social status. Great. But I have only 3 invitation cards. Besides me, will you take Kit along? I'll ask him to wait for me downstairs. I will go with daddy. I am coming! How could you empty the pool! Why did you jump in? What shall we do now? Call the ambulance! It's done! I bet he's not that strong. Nuts, he is making movies. I swear I will fight with him once. I have to see whether he is that strong or not. Be careful. You would be beaten to death. What did you say? I would rather die than lose! I won't be defeated! Alright, you are the greatest. Is that OK? Hey guys, listen to me. In two days, there will be a jewel show on the 75th floor of the Grandeur Hotel. These jewels are worth more than you can imagine. I am sure, if we're successful, you will get enough money for your retirement. Great! Quiet! Until then, we have to be very careful. No single action must be taken. Some friends warned me that there's a mole among us. To be frank, I am not sure whether he has colleague or not, but, you know my practice. If I discover him, I will kill him at once. I will kill everyone who betrays me. Don't you agree? Doctor, it's not me. I know. So, it must be you. It's you! Don't come nearer or I will kill her. Go ahead. She is ready to die for me at any time. Why are you standing around here? Kill him! Stop! Are you alright? I am fine. It's just a scratch. Mister, I am sorry. Our hotel is closed till Saturday. I'm here to look for someone. Can I help you? You have to smile with feeling. Be a bit sincere, OK? I gave it all my sincerity. Many rich businessmen will come to the show. I want all you ladies to welcome them with the warmest smiles. I will go home and watch more comedies. Speaking about movies, your idol Frankie will come tomorrow. He is great! I love him. There will be a security check tomorrow. You are not allowed to wear gold necklaces. So bad! Is Frankie that great? He never uses a double when filming. He always jumps down from high places. But don't they say he is a lady-killer? That's why he's so hot. What's wrong? I don't know. There is a big pustule on my shoulder. When we changed this morning, I saw the bandage on her shoulder. Jayce, a cop wants to see you. What's the matter? Can we talk alone? You stood me up! So why are you here now? You didn't answer my calls, and you didn't want to see me, so I have to see you this way. Forget it. Let's break up. I couldn't come to our date because I was on special duty. These robbers killed many of my colleagues. I told you many times! I don't want you to be a cop. Today, your colleagues are killed, you may be killed the day after. I am scared. I heard there was a gang war yesterday. My heart kept on beating! Don't you care about me? At least you should give me a call. I swear I won't do it again. I will be very careful. Forget it. Once the pager rings, you turn into a super cop. No, I... Jayce, I am off. Wait for me! Jayce! Jayce! Jayce, listen to me! I'll be promoted soon, so let's talk about it later, OK? Do you think you are Rambo? Jayce! What's that? My friend! Fai-Fai, are you alright? Yes. Mister, have you ever learned driving? Do you know him? No. I will take your car. My pleasure. - Wait... - Please! Jayce, don't go with him. Please listen to me! Jayce... I think you know him, right? They are quarreling. Do you want to drink a cup of coffee at my place? No, thanks. My mom is waiting for me. I will get off right here. Here is your home? I will take the MTR. Bye-bye. Are you disappointed now? No woman I really want can escape from me. I have bad news for you. Frankie will come tomorrow. Really? The movie star Frankie? He is a hero in movies. In reality, he may be not that strong. But if he is so strong? We can't take any risks. I'll order Bond to kill him. Mind your head and legs. You again! Your timing isn't good! Your legs... Left leg... Right leg... All down now! Cut! It's OK! Frankie... You! Frankie! What's wrong with you? - Come and take a look. - No one here is doing what he should! Let's go. What's the problem? Frankie, look, you always use foul language. See, you are scolding the others again. If I didn't scold them, they wouldn't do what they should. Let me do the dubbing myself. It's OK! Yes! This is perfect! Frankie, your movie will make big money again. Damn it! Are you kidding? The dubbing room is so dirty! Cockroaches everywhere! I'll never come here again! I am going to wash my hands. So dirty! - But you needn't go that fast. - I have to piss. These little guys are so frightful. If I kill him now, I can't fight with him anymore. But I've sworn that I'll fight with him. Kit, you are here? You said I have to follow you even when you go pissing. Bastard! You are so obedient! - Mister, you dropped something - Don't move! If you trust me, don't move. I trust you. You are standing on a landmine. What? It's not war time! Are you kidding? You know me long enough. Did I ever fool you? What shall we do now? Bring me a rod. I'll count to three. Then step back and I will hit it away. You have no choice. - Ready? - Wait! My leg is cramping. Let me massage it for a while. Okay. One. Two. Three. Bye-bye. Frankie is coming. She seems to like me. Be careful, she may eat you alive. We're honoured to meet you. Dad, hurry up! We meet again! Too bad. Out of energy again. Hello, it's me. I will be right there. What? I've told you before. Alright, that's it. Do you want me to teach you? A man should rely on himself. A man should rely on himself. Mister, what're you doing? Mister, you can't go in! Thank you. - The exhibition is in there. - Okay. This is a new model. You scared me. This electronic dictionary can translate French and Japanese, and it can communicate, right? Yes, it can communicate within a short distance. I am the bodyguard of Frankie. I suspect a terrorist has sneaked into the jewel show. What's the name of the criminal? Can you describe his face? I just recognize his voice! I don't know his face. That silly boy doesn't fit you. You have to find a mature man. Leave me alone! I like that silly boy. Someone is calling me. Can you ask Frankie to come down? The problem is, I don't believe that you are his bodyguard. Please go. There is a criminal, it's true! Only VIPs are invited. There won't be any criminals. You'd better leave. Don't worry. - I will report it to the police. - Go. Sorry, no more negatives. - I will go and fetch some. - Come back as soon as possible! Frankie, it feels so safe to stand next to you. You are such a pretty girl. I wish I could give you more condoms. No, I mean protection! You are so funny! You're welcome. Your new movie will be showing soon. Don't forget to invite me to the presentation. Sure! I'll invite you into my home too. Look, Frankie is fooling around with a girl. Hurry up, shoot it. Not this! Hide it. Be careful, there are security guards. Miss, are you alright? Are you alright? I am fine! Be careful. You dropped something. Thank you. You're welcome. Dad, don't worry. Sponsored by TNS Security System, the presentation of Tzar Nicholar II's jewels will now begin. Dad, I am going out for a moment. What's up? Delivery! - What is it? - A bullet. How wonderful. You are so pretty you deserve to wear it. How nice of you. What are you looking at? Still looking? Shall I give you a hit! Get lost. Sorry. You should be a bit smart! Mister, what do you want? Changing shift! Help me... Get lost! Don't come here. Help me... Please, take your hands off. I beg you, please leave me alone! One has escaped. Catch him! He must have gone to the basement. You go up to the penthouse. I will kill him. Don't talk. There are many killers in this hotel. Don't fool me. I didn't. See, my trousers are missing! If you go out, you will be raped. But don't worry. I will protect you. I hear something. For your sake, I'll check it out. There is a corpse. I am scared. Me too. The men here and in the lobby were all killed. You have to protect me. I will distract them and you will call the police. Do you love me? I love you. I love you too. Be careful. Be careful. I'm so scared. If I go out, I might be killed. Before I go, can you encourage me? Help! Frankie! Come and save me! Frankie, I know you are here. I have your girl. If you don't come out, I will kill her. If you are a man, come out! I will count to three. One. Frankie! - Two. - Frankie! Superhero? My ass! Can you ask someone to check it out? You said this Doctor entered the Grandeur Hotel, but you don't know his face so how can we look for him? What? Grandeur Hotel? He says there are criminals in the hotel. I suspect the man behind a blackmail case which happened 2 years ago is in the hotel. Why do you think so? He came across him and heard his voice. This guy killed my family. I could never forget his voice. Do you remember his face? I just talked to him over the telephone. There is a jewel show in the hotel. Yes, there are many security guards there. I will call them and check it out. Isn't your girlfriend working there? You should give her a call. I will go with you. What will happen next? Mister, may I... Get lost! Damn it! I am here with you, don't panic. I am afraid of you. Don't panic. I'll call the police! My phone is inside the pocket! Shit! Ladies and gentlemen. We just want money, not your life. If you don't co-operate with us, you will die. Sit still, don't pull off a stunt. If you make any trouble, you will be killed. Do you understand? We are lucky to report this news! Mr. Chan Lap Ming from the security company, please come out. Yes, that's me. Mr. Chan, the code please. The specialist came this morning to start it up. I don't know the code. I know nothing! I know nothing! Hurry up, you have to find out the code within 45 minutes. Sure. No problem. That's my job. I am Bond. I've always dreamed of fighting with you. I want to see how strong you are! You're kidding! Mr. Bond, you are a superhero! Aren't you Frankie? No. You disappoint me so much. Please, don't hit my face. I have to work tomorrow. Please! Thank you. Boss, a car is coming. Check who they are. If necessary, let them in and kill them. Got it. I will go in and take a look. Wait for me. - I will go in with you. - No, you can't help me. - Why not? - You needn't go with me. I won't give you any trouble. Sorry, this is a private show. Do you have an invitation card? CID. I suspect there are robbers in your hotel. - Where is your manager? - He's just gone away. When will the security officers shift duty? Mister, what's the problem? An hour ago, you were not guarding the entrance. We have just changed our shift. - I have to go up and take a look. - Alright, please follow me. Get in. You are really good. Thank you. We have no way out. I just thought you would leave me behind. I won't leave anyone behind. They are fierce! They are cold-blooded. What shall we do now? - There's only one way out. The penthouse - The penthouse? What? They are going up by the elevator? Take this. What's this? I got it from my girl. It's one of a pair. We can communicate by it over a short distance. If I die, please hand this to my girlfriend Jayce. So, you mean I'm dead meat! Come on! Please, don't destroy my image. I am a star. Frankie. Frankie! Dad, don't worry. They will go when they have the money. Don't move! Squat, squat! Squat! Jump! Quickly! Run! Papa! Don't move! No one moves! Or I will kill this computer expert. Come here. If I kill him, you can't open the computer safe. Then you will suffer a total failure! That old man is tough! Shoot him! Don't move. Tell them not to move! Or I will kill you. Order them to drop their weapons. Hurry up! Drop the weapons. Uncle, take him here. I will help to guard him. OK, go. Jayce, are you alright? I am alright. Take your hands off me. The police are coming. I'm a policeman. Stay calm. - Hello... look! - It's you! I've recorded the robbery. - You don't have to act being a good citizen. - None of your business. Frankie, come on, smile. Don't shoot below there. What're you afraid of? This is a fresh look! - Come on... - Sorry! Thank you so much! A man should rely on himself. It's you! You are Doctor! Catch the TV reporter and get the tape back. Inform Fai-Fai that we'll switch to plan B. OK! Let's go. You bastard! Shut up. Or I will throw you down. Don't kill her. If you want to kill someone, kill me. Mr. Policeman, I won't kill you. You are a perfect hostage. Watch out. Don't let anyone escape. Boss, the cops are coming. Give me a report! Some people are injured. These criminals are professional soldiers. Call for reinforcements. Calling headquarters... Move faster. Lady, where is the tape? If you hand it out, I will take them away. Otherwise, I will put more in. Seal the door and let her die inside. Then we'll go in and fetch the tape later. Bye-bye. Pretty woman, don't scream. Jump! We will catch you. I can't! My legs go numb! The monster will bite you. Jump! I will catch you. Hold me! Don't let go of my hand! See... We made it. I am scared. It's alright. Kit is holding a pretty woman! Are you jealous? I want to comfort her too. Pretty woman, don't panic. It's alright. Don't touch me. Son, watch out! Son! Give me your hand. The monster is coming! Pull me up! I thought monsters love biting pretty women. Why bite in my ass? There are some teeth of the monster still in my ass. Son, lower your voice. Hold it. Isn't that monster poisonous? Do you feel anything strange? Yes, I feel numb! It's getting worse and worse. Do you feel cold? - Cold? - Yes. I feel colder and colder. I don't think you're poisoned. If you were, you had lost consciousness by now. Kit, why did the girl collapse? She is poisoned. Dad, the monster is poisonous. You'll be alright. But I feel pain. What? I am poisoned too. Do you want your dad to suck your ass? Don't make such a fuss! Kit, they are coming. We have to run. I will go to the medical room to find a serum for her. Otherwise, she will die. You go ahead. She is a complete stranger, isn't she? When the police come, they will save her. Don't leave me alone... Papa, don't leave me alone. Don't leave me. Let's separate. Then you have a bigger chance to survive. Hurry up! I won't insist. Frankie, let's go! - My ass hurts. - Come! Kit, if you're not with us, who is going to help me? Frankie, show your guts. Don't let them look down on you.. Frankie, come! Alright. The commander has arrived. Don't worry, I won't die. I dumped you. Why did you come? If I had not come and anything happened to you, I would regret it for my whole life. Guys, I can stand the pain from the shot, but I can't stand your sweet talk! Keep out of this, or I will make your wound bigger! I tell you, when a woman gets angry, she can do things you can't imagine. What are you doing? I am afraid of being recognized. So I use your blood to disguise. Don't you have a grudge against me? No, of course not. I want to be your friend. Call me Lai. I work at a TV station. Don't you feel hot? Yes, it's a bit hot. Why not go out and have some fresh air? I am busy right now. Maybe a little later. I am afraid of height! Let's talk in the coffee shop. I don't want to fly. I am scared! If you jump down, you won't feel the height any more. I will take the elevator. It's faster if you jump. This is Kit. I'm alive. Where is the medical room? Doctor, a call from the police. This is the commander speaking. You are surrounded. You have no chance to escape. Listen. I have a famous TV producer here. I will ask him to introduce himself. I am Lai Siu Tin. No, just call me Lai. Help... It's in room 431. On the left side of the 4th floor. Save us. What do you want? Retreat 100 yards backwards and send a helicopter to wait for me on the roof. Impossible. You must surrender. It is possible. From now on, I will throw one person down every 5 minutes until I see the helicopter. And I want you to release the serial rapist. We can't accept your demands. Sir, look! This time, I dropped a corpse. In 5 minutes, I will drop a living person. Why do you want the police to release the rapist? I don't want that. I just want to irritate them. I don't know that rapist at all. But the cops will waste time with that rapist. You are super smart! Go on flattering me, or I will throw you down. You are really wise. And truly handsome too. You are the smartest boss, brilliant and outstanding... Be patient, I'll come. You are extremly clever, you are the Lion King. A super hero! 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10... Hey you! What are you doing? I am practicing! Hands up. Drop the gun. I don't have a gun, so how could I drop it? Kid, I am not talking to you. Dad, it's you? Of course. Now you aren't so cocky anymore. Don't move. Didn't you hear? My dad told you not to move. Do as you're told. A torch?! Dad, you are so cool! Of course I'm cool. If you were not that cool, mom wouldn't have fallen for you. Cut the crap, better watch out. Let me drag him away first. Stop! What are you doing? Who asked you to shoot? How dare you bother me! I won't accept that from anyone. Dad, let's run! There are many gangsters out there. Search the other floors. Bond, you stay here. Who do you think you are! Think you can give me orders? If you have brains, don't mess with me. How dare you threaten me! Bitch, do you want to die? Dad, the pretty woman! So cruel! Bitch. Don't move! How dare you beat a woman! Hold your right leg with your left hand. Lick your left eye with your tongue. Lie down on the floor. Dad, tie him up! Son, are you kidding? I'm not strong enough for that. I'll tie him up then. Dad, come and help. You're so troublesome! How can I help you? Who'll hold the gun? Give it to me. Thank you. No, you're a woman! This gun is quite heavy. Son, do it yourself! Dad, I can't! Come and help me. I'm exhausted. You're so useless! Thank you. Please hold it for me. Be careful. If you press the trigger, it'll shoot. Yeah! What's wrong? Is my hair messy? Down... there. Down. Yes. Not here. I mean there. I thought you were smart, but you're as stupid as a pig. I warn you. Don't say I'm as stupid as a pig. She is right. You are as stupid as a pig. She is a gang member. Your dad is smarter than you. She thought she's clever! I kept the bullets! It's not loaded! Don't hit my dad. I warn you, give up now. I don't want to hurt you. Stop fighting! Stop fighting! No! Son, are you alright? Don't be afraid of her. Don't kill him. We need him as a hostage. OK, but I want him to change clothes and then beat him up. What clothes? This is my film costume! I want to defeat the hero who wears this costume. Why didn't you leave me? I've sworn never to leave a woman or a child again. Again? Did you do that before? My wife and son were killed by those bastards upstairs. I'm sorry. Where is the tape? I put it under one of these show cases. If we don't survive, this tape will be the only evidence. What shall we do now? I'll fetch it and hand it to the police. Don't leave me alone. I'll come back to rescue you. I'm unforgiving. Remember. If you don't come back, I'll hate you forever. Oh Yeah! This diamond necklace fits you best. Go with me. Stop dreaming! Don't touch him. Why should I listen to you, huh? Let him! Let him! What are you doing? Let me! I could have escaped safely. But you, you messed up the whole party! What shall I do with you now? Hello everybody, we're back. Superstar, where is your bodyguard? I don't know. Why don't you know that? Take a few men and search for Kit Li. I want to see his corpse. Yes. - Where is Turtle? - He's gone to the toilet. Rabbit, how are you? Rabbit? Rabbit! Arrest him. Don't arrest me, I am a good guy. The robbers are up there. One of them is a bomb specialist, Everyone back on position! The firemen, go there to put out the fire. Let me go. I am not a criminal. Sir, we have just seen gunfire on the 6th floor. Later, this man jumped out of the window. Luckily, we opened the rescue net for him. I know him. He is Frankie's bodyguard. Let him free. Tell me what's happening there. There are over 10 criminals, all heavily armed. A guy called Doctor. He is the man behind the blackmail case that happened two years ago. Why do you know all this? I will explain to you later. Call the bomb disposal experts here. There are many bombs. The criminals and the hostages are in the penthouse. They demand a helicopter. Will you accept that? Among the hostages are two ambassadors. We can't take this responsibility. Take him to hospital. I am fine. I have to go in again. Are you crazy? This tape was recorded by a reporter. It shows the crime. - Take a look at it at once. - Yes, sir. So Kit Li killed my brother? Did you listen? Your bodyguard Kit Li killed my brother. I... I'm so sorry to hear that. Your brother is dead. Sorry, you are such a poor guy. I didn't mean anything wrong. I'm really sorry for your brother. You will pay for his life. It's not my fault! Boss! - What's up? - Not you. I know how you can force the police to send a helicopter. Tell me, why should the police listen to me? Tell them if they don't send a helicopter, you will push the foreigners down. How can you say such a thing! Shut up! I just want to save you all. I've heard that. It's a very good idea. But the ambassadors are useful to me. So I have to ask for your help. No, no! Out of the way! I don't want to die! Save me! Commander, listen. In five minutes, I want to see a helicopter on the roof. And send the guy who jumped from 6th floor back to me. If you pull off a stunt, I will execute the two ambassadors. If you co-operate with me, I will let the ambassadors and 20 women go. That's him! Call a helicopter here. Over. What did he want? An exchange of hostages? I knew he would demand this. Strange fellow... Strange fellow, are you here? Pretty woman, where are you going to? Don't kill me. I haven't screwed a reporter yet. If you make me happy, maybe I won't kill you. Here? Shall I use my hand? You don't like that? Plus my tongue, OK? I'm an expert with tongue and hands. You will be happy. I know you want to show me this. Exactly! Let's try, it's better than waiting for death. Send more men up there. If you see Kit Li, kill him. "Don't go to the roof." That's why he knows everything. I see, he has this for communication. No, I can't let you risk your life. My boss and my friends are inside. And my fiancee too. I can't leave them alone. Sorry, I can't allow you to go. - Don't move. - Don't shoot. Stay calm. Stay calm. Get out! When this case is over, I will turn myself in. I just want to save more lives. Sorry. I wish you good luck. I've tried my best to help you. In fact, I am good at karate. Don't shoot without my order. Be careful, don't damage public property. He is a damned brave guy. Don't go to the rooftop. Darling. They want to kill you on the rooftop. Go back. Your honey. Fire! Shoot him down! - We must help him. - You can't go in. You can't go in, let's run! Strange fellow! Strange fellow! I am here! Let me go! Let me go! Doctor, I know you are here! Come out! Sorry, I didn't want to bring you in such a mess. This bomb is the same as the one you didn't defuse last time. In 5 minutes, it'll explode. I've got two jewels out of three. I will be rich enough. But you, you will be a have-not forever. Run! Don't take care of me! He will die with you soon. Come and kill me. But if you come, you have no time to defuse the bomb. This was left by him. I'm begging on my knees. Please forgive me. If you are obedient and serve as our hostage, I will let you live. But this policeman is too dangerous. - Fai-Fai, don't! - Get lost. What is it? Stop fighting. How dare you kick me! Stop. Don't beat my dad... Don't beat my dad. Don't beat my dad! Good kick. Frankie, you are cool! You! You can beat me, but don't beat my dad. Oh, the Superhero! You think you are so great? Didn't you want to fight with me? Okay. Come on. Come on. Your punch is... Your reaction is too slow. - Come out! - I won't come out! I won't come out for sure! Go to hell! Why do you run away from me? I am scared. Where did you get this? I bought it in your shop. At 10% discount. That's not fair. I have no weapon. I will give you mine. Out of pity. It doesn't hurt... It doesn't hurt... It hurts! I pity you. So I'll have mercy on you. Do you want to run away? Beat him, beat him! Frankie, beat him! Jayce! Jayce! Wake up! I thought you would die. I was so scared! I won't die. Don't be afraid. Let's go and take care of Frankie. My son! Are you hurt? - What did you think, dad? - My poor son! Help me, help me, help me... There is an injured man. Thank god! I thought I would never see my family again. How does it look? I have to cut one of them. Two years ago, I chose the red one. What happened then? My wife and son were killed by the bomb. Then, cut the blue one. But if he changed it? Then better leave me alone. Save your own life. I promised I wouldn't leave you alone. Go. I won't hate you. It makes me happy to know that a man is willing to die for me. If I survive this, I'll marry you. - Hello? - I just want to tell you that I escaped. Have you made up your mind yet? Which one is it? Red or blue? Hurry up, you have only 50 seconds left. What do you want? I just want to know whether you've made the right choice. Hurry up, you have no time to consider. You don't want to know which wire I choose. You just want me to do it quickly. There's an unisolated wire again. Last time, you added a tiny metallic wire. It was a clever trick. You won't use it one time only. No matter if I cut the blue or the red wire, it'll explode. The right wire is the tiny wire behind the red one. Doctor, you lost. You're lucky! But I'll have many more chances in the future. I'll keep on planting bombs. But now, I have to go. Do you want to kill me now? Come on, kill me! Do you feel cold and is your nose bleeding? The dagger I stabbed you with was stained with snake venom. You shouldn't have run away. If you were in an ambulance now, you had a chance to survive. But you've fled too quickly and too far, so you're deadly poisoned now. You're lying... Look! What's with that guy? Save me... Hurry up. I have the watch. Let's get away from here. Let me thank everyone for your support and your concern. This was a great challenge for me. And I want to announce if you buy 3 rolls of toilet paper with my label in the next 3 days, you can win a ticket to my new film. All the money will go to a fund in favour of the victims. Will you also do a charity show? Of course I will do that. Thank you. I thank you all. Look. Wait. We will disclose his secret and our rating will raise. We'll get an award! We'll become famous! This jewel show incident was a very interesting story. In case you want to know every detail, I've decided to make a movie about it. Dad, isn't this a good idea? There's one thing I have to explain. How could I beat such a huge gang? I had a very important assistant who helped a lot. Tell us, who was it? It was the Royal Hong Kong Police. Please give them a hand! Thank you, thank you. What are you thinking? I haven't had a sound sleep for long but always had nightmares. But tonight I will sleep well. You have to come with us and give your testimony. Seems I won't get sleep again. Never mind. You can sleep after the testimony. My bed is comfortable. You will have a good sleep. What are you staring at me! Shall I disclose your secret? Get a move on!
