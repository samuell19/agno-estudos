All the other nuns have either left or died. How sad. You think she'd be lonely here all by herself. Well, we did offer to put her into a retirement home, but she spent most of her life here at the school. And... she is as strong as an ox. So there's really no reason not to let her stay here with us. And besides, I like her being here. I think it's good for the girls to have her around. She's a good influence. Good evening, Sister. Good evening. Good evening, Sister. Evening, girls. Put it out. You know better than that, Josephine. Don't worry about it. Of course he likes me. Anyway, that's beside the point. Chip won't get away from me at the dance next week. He's sex crazy. Yeah, well, so am I about Scott. Although I've got more pressing problems to worry about at the moment with my exams. You'll never get away with it. You know, Michelle. Well, we'll see. Hi, Michelle. Hi, Linda. How you hangin'? Oh, Linda, I'll kill you. This is the guy I was talking about. You'll never make it, Jenny. My way's safer. Lights out, girls. Lights out. Gretchen, Michelle, to your own rooms, please. Good night. Good night, girls. Honestly, it's just not fair. Oh, come on, Jackie. Don't cry. They won't send you to another school. They're probably just trying to scare you. You don't know my father. Will you run away? Oh, well, if Rich will. Mary, I really love him. Yes, I know. I'd probably do the same. Thanks. Rich? Oh, where are you? Rich? Rich? Is that you? Rich? What are you doing? Oh, my God. Oh, no! No! No! No! No! Hello, Jackie. I've been waiting for you. Jackie. Jackie. Did you think you'd get away from me? Jackie. No! Rich didn't get away from me. Neither will you. My Lord, forgive me, for I have sinned. Satan has tempted me yet again... and I find myself judging the sinners around me. I know I should feel pity, but my anger blinds me. I found one, Mr. Sheffield. Well done, Sister. Girls, come over here. Come on. Quickly now. Hurry up, you two. I still can't believe the nerve of them, getting us to work on a Saturday. I mean, who honestly cares about worms? Earthworms are only good for threading onto fishhooks. As I am going fishing tomorrow, any contribution for bait will be gratefully received. You see? We can do it tomorrow. You know I don't want to get involved in all that. Oh, really. Wouldn't you like to pass at least one exam in your life? Not if it means cheating. Jennifer, what did I just say? Um, worms. Jennifer, pay attention. Back to the worm. Six weeks. Six weeks, and this kid is finally out of Winchester. No more reports, no more detentions, no more fart-faced Fazio. No more teachers... No kidding. I heard your old man signed up old fart-face to a long term contract... to be your private tutor at university. Ha. Ha. Ha. Hi, Scott. Hi, Scott. Hiya, Scott. Heard anything from Jackie yet? Nope. What about Rich? Nothing. His parents are up at the school today cleaning his stuff out. They were pretty upset. Yeah? His old lady was crying, carrying on about her baby being too young to get married. His old man wasn't any better. He's gonna kill him if he gets his hands on him. Really? And doesn't care if he got her preggers. Well, that would be too late, wouldn't it? Mmm, mmm. Isn't that your favorite townie? If I'm not mistaken, Winchester outnumbers that lot. You guys aren't gonna start that again, are you? Shut it, Zits. You don't want 'em to bust up the dance tonight, do ya? You don't know they're going to do that. Well, it won't hurt to discourage them, will it? I reckon the best job would have to be an airline pilot. No, no. P.R. man. That's the thing. Hmm. I mean, that's got to be, like, the all-time job. Driving round in a Merc, the best clothes, the best women... Everything on an expense account. I could live with that. What? Um, what exactly does a P.R. man do? Well, I don't know for sure, but... Oh, look out. Assholes at 12:00. Hey, shit for brains. You guys really know how to stink up the street. Why do I get the feeling this isn't going to end too well? I'm talking to you, shithead. Didn't anyone ever tell you it was rude not to listen to someone who was talking to you? Hmm. Well, what you gotta know is we're just poor, dumb townies... and we don't know nothing about manners... Billy - or any of that fancy stuff you Winchester boys do. Isn't the midget a humble little fella? Yeah. And the midget hears that the favorite sport at Winchester... is for you fags to play drop the soap in the shower. You little runt! Come on, then. Line up. Line up. Come on. On your feet. On your feet, son. Get up. Come on, you two. Over here. Get up. They started it. We were just... Shut up. Get over there. Come on. Move. Now, how many times have I gotta tell you guys I'm tired of breaking up your brawls? I don't like it, the people in the town don't like it, the people who pay my wages don't like it. Come here. Come here! Now, you read my lips, wise guy. The next time I have to break up one of these brawls, everyone... everyone... will go to jail. Mercy. Get out. And take your little rich friends with you. Move! And as for you guys, the next time I have to... Oh, Christ, Billy. I fell on an ashtray. You all right, mate? Come on. Get him in the car. Watch it. Try holding his leg. See if you can stop the bleeding. Watch it. Careful. Hey, Kev. How's it goin'? A lot better than your face. What did you run into? Oh, some rich boy's fist. Winchester again? You should have been there. We were kicking the crap out of them... till Desmond came and broke it up. What's your definition of kicking the crap out of someone? Bleeding all over them? That's Billy's blood. He cut himself on an ashtray, bled all over Desmond's car on the way to the hospital. Well, is he okay? Yeah, that's what they say. He's supposed to take it easy for a couple of days. That's why he's come up with a plan... where he doesn't have to move around too much. Okay, I'll buy it. What plan? The dance tonight at St. Elizabeth's. Those dickheads from Winchester. Mark, doesn't it bother you that nothing ever changes? I mean, those jerks you fought with from Winchester today... I mean, when they graduate, they'll go on and become hotshot doctors and lawyers. When we get out, we'll end up with one of the bimbos in our class. Susan over there. Yeah, the curse of the lower class. I could handle that. Yeah, well, on second thoughts, maybe Susan isn't the best example of what I mean. Mark, 10 years from now, I'll inherit my dad's gas station, you'll be the world's oldest box boy at Woolworth's... and we'll go on to raise the next generation of surfers... who can fight with the next generation of punks at Winchester. Well, for Billy's plan to work, he says he'll need your truck. Billy's a dickhead too. What time? About 8:00. The Lord's my shepherd I'll not want He makes me Down to lie In pastures green He leadeth me The quiet waters by My soul he doth Restore again But mass is almost over. Mary. Doth make Within the paths I have never heard such nonsense in my life. I spend good money on sending my daughter... to this school for an education, and what do I find? - She seems to be able to get out and about whenever... Excuse me, Mr. - Owens. Oh, Mary. The Sister said... Yes, yes. Come in, please. This is Mary Huston, Jackie's roommate, and this is Mr. and Mrs. Owens. They're hoping that you might be able to shed some light on Jackie's running off. I've told you everything I know, Mrs. Sheffield. Well, we'd like you to tell us. Well, it's just that Jackie was really upset. She thought you were going to transfer her to another school. She was having an affair with that boy from Winchester. This is supposed to be a Catholic school, and my daughter... Brad. My daughter... a 16-year-old... W-was sneaking off and probably having some sexual relationship. Mr. Owens, I really must insist. Mary, I think you'd better wait out in the hall. Please, Mary, did Jackie say anything the night she ran away? She said she loved him... Really loved him. Oh, and I'm sure you know all about love, don't you? Especially that kind of love. What kind of goddamn Catholic school is this anyhow? Mary, Mary. Mary, please try to understand. Mr. Owens is very upset. He loves Jackie so much. Then why did he send her to a boarding school? He shouldn't have spoken to you the way he did. I'm sorry, Mary. You're just a small-town girl Twigs in your hair stars in your eyes You cannot shake the look on Mama's face the tears she cried Lonely on the boulevard Nightlife shy See now, open wide I flash before your eyes Day after day and time after time Good evening, Jennifer. Hi, Mr. Sheffield. It's a lovely dress. Thank you. Have a good time. I will. Stand tall Walk proud Reach out You're playing for the world Don't cry Be strong This is really gross. I know. It's so juvenile. Hi, Scott. You look almost as bored as we are. As usual. This dance sucks. But I think I've got the cure for that. Cover me, girls. If Sheffield sees you with that, she'll get you kicked out of Winchester for sure. Not to mention what she'd do to us. She won't give me any trouble. It's harder than it seems Stand tall Walk proud Reach out You're playing for the world Don't cry Be strong Reach out Gotta keep holding on Okay, we're in. Now what? Relax, Kev. This is great. All we do now is... is wait for Billy's plan to work... whatever it is. Well, I'd feel a lot better if I knew what the little maniac had in mind. Has he ever let us down before? Forget I asked. I think this is what's known as being behind enemy lines. We'd better split up. Stand tall Walk proud Reach out You're playing for the world Don't cry Be strong Reach out Gotta keep holding on Stand tall Walk proud Reach out You're playing for the world Don't cry Be strong Reach out Gotta keep holding on Stand tall Walk proud Walk proud Reach out You're playing for the world Don't cry Be strong Reach out Gotta keep holding on Stand tall Walk proud Reach out You're playing for the world Don't cry Be strong Reach out Gotta keep holding on Stand tall Walk proud Walk proud - You're playing for the world Don't cry Be strong Reach out Gotta keep holding on Stand tall Walk proud Reach out You're playing for the world Don't cry Be strong Be strong Gotta, gotta Gotta keep holding on Stand tall Baby, baby Mary. I've been waiting for you. Mary. What are you doing way over here? Oh, just taking a break. Chip! Do you want some scotch? Maybe later. Oh, okay. Well, see you later. How did you know my name? Your last dancing partner. You are not an easy person to find. You seem to have managed it all right. Do you always pursue girls you don't even know? Well, the pretty ones. I don't think I know you. Have you just transferred to Winchester? Yeah, my father's in the oil business. He tends to move round a lot. Oil, did you say? Yeah, you got it. We're up to our necks in the stuff. Now, if I didn't know any better, I'd say you're not who you claim to be. Oh, great. That's nice. Me, Chad Blakemore, one of the Melbourne Blakemores, a phony? Is it that obvious? Well, it wasn't too hard. Chad? Kevin Lynch. Impostor from Coopers Bay. Mary Huston, from Texas. Of course it doesn't matter to me who you are. This one's for all the young lovers here tonight. Would you like to dance, Miss Huston from Texas? Why, thank you, Mr. Lynch. Last time we went made my back itchy. Don't worry. I'll get a blanket out of the car. Do you See what I see You know people make me nervous Standing in front of me Should I lay on my back Make like I just don't see Should I leave myself in the open Like it was meant to be I remember when Mom would take my hand And she'd put her arms around me And she'd sing If they're standing in the line of fire Shoot 'em down Standing in the line of fire Never give up your ground Standing in the line of fire Shoot 'em down Standing in the line of fire Never give up your ground Oh, yeah If you were lucky you saw me Pleased to meet 'em Take it all the way And never give you a thought, babe Love heals at the end of the day I remember when Mom would take my hand She'd put her arms around me Standing in the line of fire Here we go again. Standing in the line of fire Never give up your ground Standing in the line of fire Shoot 'em down What are you doing here, skunk? This dance isn't open to assholes from town. "Skunk"? Me? W-Well, it's true there is a smell around here, and, uh, I'm here to do a public service and check out if it's you guys... who are carrying turds in your wallets. Is that supposed to be funny? No. It's like I said. It's a public service. You see, the state law says that you're supposed to carry your I.D.'s... Kevin! Kevin! I remember when Mom would take my hand Kevin! Kevin! Kevin, it's time. Damn. I-I've gotta go. I-If I don't go to him, they're gonna kill him. - Keep going, Mark. Keep going. - Standing in the line of fire Never give up your ground Standing in the line of fire That was a very big mistake to stop running, asshole. That sure seems to be a favorite word of yours. Does it, uh, run in your family? If this is the great plan Billy worked out, well, confidentially, I think it sucks, yeah? Well, this is the plan, Kev. Asshole! With Billy's compliments, asshole. Guys, let's go! You picked a great time to meet a girl. Operator, I'd like to place a collect call to the United States. Los Angeles. The area code is 213, and the number is 555-2716. Thank you. Hello? Hi, Mum. It's Mary. Darling, what's wrong? Nothing's wrong. I just need to say hi to my mum. Jesus, darling, you frightened the life out of me. Well, it's been a month since you've rung me. I was wondering if you're okay. How's the movie going? Oh, heavens. Do you know what time it is here in L.A.? No, I don't. I'm sorry. So am I, Mary. I have an early call in the morning. You know what I'm like if I don't get my eight hours sleep. I'm really sorry, Mum. I just didn't... Have you taken your exams yet? Well, that's why I wanted to... Never mind. I know you'll do well. Please, darling, I must get my sleep. I'll call you next week if I get the time. Be good, work hard. Bye. But... Mum. What are you doing here? Looking for you. Can I come up? "Come up"? My dorm mother will kill me. Will she take a bribe? Shh! I'll come down. Hi. Hi. We sort of got interrupted before. How did you find me? The guys dumped me off outside the gate. I saw you leave the auditorium and head back here. Well, your light came on, and I thought we sort of got along and... And you thought what? Well, tomorrow's Sunday, and I... I thought you might like to go to the beach. I've got a small boat. It's nothing much, of course, but... I thought we could sail over to the Channel Islands. Thanks. I'd... I'd love to. You really would? Sure. I'd love to, Kevin. I'll pick you up at 9:00. Great. Oh, no, wait. I can't. I've gotta go to mass first. 9:30 would be okay. 9:30 then. Look, um, I've gotta go. I could get expelled for this. There's something we didn't quite finish before. Guess I'd better go. I guess. 9:30 then? 9:30. Mary, I'm not a Catholic. Would it be okay if I went to church with you tomorrow? It starts at 8:30. I'll be there. Amen Amen Amen Amen This is the Lamb of God... who takes away the sins of the world. Deliver us, Lord, from every evil... and grant us peace in our day. In your mercy, keep us free from sin... and protect us from all anxiety... as we wait in joyful hope for the coming of our savior, Jesus Christ. Stop it, you two. And grant us peace and unity... I've told you. I haven't seen Gretchen since the dance. Well, I hope old Sheffield doesn't find out she stayed out all night. The body of Christ. Amen. The body of Christ. Amen. The body of Christ. Amen. The body of Christ. Amen. Psst, psst, psst. Puss, puss, puss. It's open. Told you. Well, maybe he's in there. Yeah, and maybe it's old Martika fixing the pipes again. Come on. What if we get caught? We won't. Do you think your time might be better spent studying? I've been studying all year. You got A's and B's all year. Look, that's not good enough, Jennifer. Don't you understand? If I don't get straight A's... It's open. Oh, no. Mr. Sheffield. We were looking for you. Oh, yes? What do you want? It's about the test tomorrow. We were wondering if you could tell us any specific chapters we might study. Mr. Sheffield? Oh, uh, all of them. All of the chapters. The test will consist of a number of difficult questions taken from anywhere in the book. Oh. Lucky us. Well, we're sorry to have bothered you, sir. No bother at all. Any time I can help my girls after class time. Well, thanks again, sir. No bother. Well, sweethearts, I have some special treats for you today. Shh, shh, shh, shh. You're good. Oh, you get better every time. Well, I have got a great teacher in biology. Then I think it's time for your second lesson. What was that? Probably just my Myles. Your husband? Hey, there's no need to get upset. It really doesn't matter. Doesn't matter? What do you mean it doesn't matter? He's just gonna walk in here and say, "Hi, dear. Having a nice screw?" And then walk out? Just stay put. Let me handle this. And, uh, I'll be back in a minute. I, uh, thought you had work to do all day. I just needed to take a break. I thought I told you before not to come barging in on me. I thought I told you before to knock. I live here too, you know. Myles! Are you answering back to me? Who was it today? Mind your own business. I really don't see it's any concern of yours. I... I remember when I used to be the one to make... Myles. You know, you're getting closer and closer... to you know what. Maybe now you'll... Oh, great. Oh! Oh. You've just ruined my whole day. Get out of here, Myles. Do I have to tell you again? Go to your room. And no cats. Do you hear me? The goddamn bloody cats. How did you ever find this place? I started coming over here when I was a kid. About nine or 10, I think. Your parents let you? They didn't know. They knew I was gone, but they didn't know where the hell I went. Sometimes I'd be gone two or three days. Didn't they worry about you? They cried all over the place the first time I came back. The second time Mum still cried, but the old man took a belt to me. After a while, I kept doing it, and they just let me be. I guess they just figured I was crazy. So, why did you keep coming back here? Maybe I was crazy. So, what's the real reason? I don't know. I guess I didn't like the world very much. Over here I could be anything I wanted to be. I'm sure you could be. You do? Yes. Mary, I think you're rather special. Special? Yeah. Someone who I could easily fall in love with. I think we should go back now. Mary, did I say something wrong? No, I just want to go back. Well, if I did something, I apologize. No, it's not your fault. I guess I should have expected it. Expected what? You know who my mother is. Mrs. Huston? What difference does it make who your mother is? It's who you are that counts. I'm only interested in you, Mary. Kevin, you know, I think you might be... Well, you're sort of special too. I don't think I've ever been more confused in all my life. But it feels good. Come on. Come on, mate. Come on, shorty. Here you go. Ooh, there you go. Ooh, is it cold? Come on. We'll go and see if we can find Mum, eh? Don't pour that yet. Wait for Daddy. Oh, damn it! I told you... Oh! I told you not to pour that. Look, why can't you just listen and do what you're told? I'm sorry. Sorry isn't good enough. There you go. I didn't mean to get so mad. You about ready for lunch? I gotta go. Oh, Des. Yeah, I know. There's no point in spoiling the kids' fun. Alex will run me up to the house so I can get changed. Well, what happened? Another boy from Winchester disappeared. Well, is that all? Has anyone checked St. Elizabeth's to see if one of the girls is gone? I don't know. All I know is Mr. Gordian's very upset, and he insists on seeing me. That funny little man. Hmm. Funny or not, he is the headmaster of Winchester, and that makes him an important funny little man in this town. Any chance you'll come back here, or... do we just meet you at home later? I'll do my best. But I gotta find out what's goin' on. Don't wait up. Don't wait up. Ah, Desmond. Mr. Gordian. Sorry to have dragged you away. That's okay. I'm rather worried about my boys. What seems to be the problem? Teenagers, Desmond. Teenagers. I mean, you can take my word for it that sooner or later... they're going to discover sex. Well, that's all right. That's life. The problem comes when they think they've invented it. And that's when you usually get the kids running away. They take off and work this wonderful new invention of theirs to death, and then... Mr. Gordian, forgive me for interrupting, but I left a picnic with my family because you said a boy disappeared last night. Desmond, if my fears are correct, it's more than just that boy last night. Richard Hampton and that girl from St. Elizabeth's have been gone for almost two weeks. Now, I have been a teacher for 37 years... Headmaster here for 11. I've seen boys run away with girls before, but never just drop off the face of the earth. Not for this long. Not like those two. Oh, excuse me, Desmond. Uh, Murphy. Yes, sir? A word, if I may. Using my prerogative as headmaster, I have looked at the results of last Friday's history examination, and I think, uh, when they are posted up on Monday, I think that you are going to find... that all the extra work has paid off. Well done, Murphy. Well done. Thank you, sir. We were talking about your fears. I want to show you something. Do you ever feel as if the hairs on the back of your neck are standing up? That you're frightened for no apparent reason? Oh, it's nothing you can see or hear or touch. Just something that you sense. Something fearful. Dangerous. Look, maybe you better get to the point. Well, that's the way I've been feeling ever since young Hampton went missing. Now today with the Stewart boy also missing. You keep saying he's missing, but it's kind of early for that, isn't it? It's mid afternoon. He's only been gone since last night. And as you say, teenagers will discover sex. Uh-huh. The young man does seem to be in the age of discovery. Indeed. What is of significance is inside the refrigerator. Insulin. The boy who disappeared last night has severe diabetes. He has to take a shot every morning and every evening. He took one last night just before leaving for the dance at St. Elizabeth's, where he was last seen... with a girl on his way to a... A lovers' lane in the woods. The same lovers' lane that Richard Hampton was last seen heading for... to meet his girl two weeks ago. Have you talked to anyone in St. Elizabeth's? No, not this time. You did last time? Yes, uh... Well, at least I tried to. The new headmistress, Mrs. Sheffield, didn't seem very concerned. In fact, she made a rather tasteless joke about... bitches on heat jumping over the kennel fence. Okay. I'll, uh, see what I can find out. Uh, Desmond, I'd like you to know that in the past I... Well, I would have handled this myself. I've always had a very good relationship with the people at St. Elizabeth's. But this... It's just this new woman. I'll, uh, take this along in case I run into young Stewart. So long. See. It's locked. Don't worry. I know another way. Come on. I know another way. Oh, I just knew you would. Look, this is madness. Jenny, we have the test tomorrow, and I have to pass it. Look over there. It's gotta be here somewhere. Well, he could have taken it home to work on. Come on. Try not to make a mess of anything, or he'll know someone was here. What do you want? Why don't you stay in your own room? I just need to go back to my classroom. I'm still preparing for the test tomorrow. Yes, well, I suppose you might as well. You're not good for anything around here. Myles. We're having dinner tonight at the Cannons'. We're to leave here by 8:15. You're really upset, aren't you? No. I've just got a lot of things on my mind. Liar. But then it's your own fault, isn't it? You shouldn't have come back for your milk and cookies, should you? You know how I like to spend my Sunday afternoons. He was good, Myles. God. He was better than you could ever hope to be. Look, it's not here. It's gotta be. I feel really creepy about this. If Sheffield catches us, he's gonna kill us. Jennifer! If I don't do well on that test tomorrow, my father won't just kill me, he'll do worse. He'll take away my car. Now come on. It has to be in here. If you pry it open, he's bound to know someone was here. What's wrong? What's wrong? Oh, no, please, Mr. Sheffield. Please don't do this. Oh, Jennifer. See you tomorrow. Well, my last class lets out at 10 to 3:00. I'll be here. You never did tell me who your mother was. She's Mrs. Huston. - Mystery woman. - Mary. I'd better go. Tomorrow? I'll think about you all day. Hello? Can I help you? Uh, you're Mr. Sheffield, aren't you? That's right. Is there some trouble? Well, yes. It seems a boy from Winchester has disappeared... and the last place he was seen was here at the dance last night. Oh, dear, no. Not another elopement? Well, I'd like to find out if any of the girls are missing. That could be a difficult chore. Monday morning, we... Are you sure the boy is missing? I mean, it is the weekend. They're sure all right. And I don't want to wait until the morning. I see. You had better talk with my wife. Come with me. She's at home at the moment. She's not feeling very well. So, uh, perhaps I'd better phone her first. Okay. That was our last school. Near Boston. Taught there for a time. A few years ago. Uh, Virginia. I'm sorry. Did I wake you? Not feeling better, huh? We're going to have to think about getting a supply teacher... for your classes tomorrow. Well, you may be the headmistress of the school, but we know who's boss in our house, and I am saying you are too sick to teach tomorrow. That's being sensible. Now, Virginia, I hate to trouble you with this, but... there is a police officer here with me. It seems another boy from Winchester is missing. That's exactly what I said. All we need is another elopement. What the officer wants to know is are any of our girls missing. That's right. He was last seen at our school dance. That's exactly what we need. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Right. We'll wait for you here in your office. Good-bye, sweetheart. She's going to call the housemother. It may take a little while. Would you care for some coffee? It won't take long. I really do make a wonderful cup of coffee. American style with a lot of chicory. To tell you the truth, Mr. Sheffield, I have a number of things to do in town. When you have the information, maybe you could give me a call. Fine. Thanks for the offer of coffee. You're welcome. - Hello. - Mary Huston? Yes, speaking. Mary, this is Mr. Sheffield. I'm calling because some of the telephone lines to town are down. I-I happened to be in the office when a call came in for you. F-From a boy. He said that you were with him this afternoon. Kevin. Kevin, yes. That's right. Um, he said he tried calling you but couldn't get through. Now, Mary, I really shouldn't have taken the message. Message? He said, would you meet him at 9:00? Where? Now, Mary, you know the school rules about taking personal messages. But the boy, Kevin... He seemed most anxious and said it was very important, so... Just this once. I really do appreciate it, sir. Okay. So it's 9:00 in the woods. The woods? Well, that's what he said. Uh, just by the school campus. You know, near the auditorium. He-He says you know the place. Uh, Mary, I said I would call him back after I'd spoken with you, and I can't recall his number. I've got the number. Just a minute. I'll get it for you. Beeler, I want you to get the California State Police on the phone. California? What the hell would you want them for? Just get them. But I wouldn't know who to call. Call the operator. Call information. But get 'em now! Hey, Sarge, what's the problem? Bunch of license plates from the wrong state. A man who pretends to make phone calls but doesn't. Three missing kids. What the hell are you talking about? The people who were brought in to run St. Elizabeth's. Any idea where they're from? Honey, look, I won't be able to make it home for dinner. No, I'm sorry. I just can't. I'm not sure, but it looks pretty ugly. Look, sweetie, I gotta go. I'll call you when I can. Me too. Yeah, bye. Boston. The people who they brought in to run St. Elizabeth's... were qualified teachers working in Boston. She wanted to head back home, so they applied for the post of headmistress and teacher. The post was advertised. I remember it well. Boston. That's where they had their last school. - You sure? - Oh, yeah, I'm positive. See, my kid sister goes to St. Elizabeth's. I remember seeing that story featured in the school magazine. Then why have all the cars in the Sheffields' last graduation photograph... got California license plates? Hey, Kev. Phone. I'll finish off here. You better go. It's a girl. Hello? Kevin? My name's Linda. Linda Chandler. I'm a... I'm a friend of Mary's. She asked me to call. Is something wrong? No, it's just that the phones from school are down. I'm calling from a pay phone. Mary says she has to see you tonight. Tonight? Where? In the woods behind the school n-near the campus... at 9:00. Linda, if something's wrong... Look, that's all she said. Just be there. It's important. Okay. I did what you asked, Mr. Sheffield. Yes, you did. Look, Mr. Mayor, we're only a six-man police force, and we're spread all over the place at the moment. - The Sydney Police have the manpower... - For what? We don't even know for sure that anything is wrong. Coopers Bay is basically a quiet, peaceful, trouble-free little town. Sure, there's the odd scrap between the Winchester boys and the local lads. Now and then someone gets drunk and we have to sober them up in our one and only cell. But then suddenly, not one, not two, but three girls mysteriously disappeared. Now, we found out that over in California... three teenage couples were missing... and then later found dead and buried near a lovers' lane by the school. And we know the state of California's... still looking for a teaching couple that matches the Sheffields' description. Christ! Why did I have to take this job? Christ! And what if you're wrong? Then it'll be the happiest day of my life. Then you admit you could be wrong? I've already talked to Hank. Bryant's on his way there now to get the search warrant for the school and grounds. You had no right to do that without consulting me first. I'm going out to the school now. I'm gonna talk to Myles Sheffield. I'm gonna tell him who I think he really is. If he is the man I want, he's liable to get a touch violent. Now, I've got a wife and two kids. We'd all appreciate a little backup. You wanna make that phone call, or do I have to? Christ! Myles? What the hell are you doing? You know we're due at the Cannons'. You're not even dressed. You were supposed to come back to the cottage and get ready. Why don't you say something? Why are you standing there like a moron? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Virginia. You maniac. You've done it again. I'm sorry. You promised me. You promised me never again. I'm sorry. I covered up for you last time. I'm sorry. Now you've wrecked everything! I'm sorry. You maniac! What's wrong with you? How many? Myles? How many this time? I don't know. Oh, you idiot! I had everything this time! I was headmistress. Virginia. You bastard. You dumb bastard! How could you do this to me? I'm not helping you this time. I'm not helping you. I'm getting as far away as possible. I'm not helping. It's too late. All things bright and beautiful All creatures great and small All things wise and wonderful The Lord God Are you lookin' for this, Mr. Sheffield? You evil man. You evil, evil man. Why? Why are you doin' this? I want you to put that down, Sister. And then I want you to go away from here. No. No. I will do nothin' of the kind. Myles, you need help. You're ill. You have to go to the police. I've already tried to phone them, but the lines are down. Give it to me. Myles, God will forgive you. Give it to me. No. No, you must stop. You must... Kevin? Desmond, are you there? Beeler. Yeah, what do you want? A girl from the school has been murdered in a phone booth. Copped it in the guts. I'm just waiting for the ambulance now. Des? Can you hear me? Yeah, I can hear you. Clear up the mess and get down to the school. Out. Myles? Myles? What do you want now? Haven't you done enough? Hi. Oh! What are you doing here? Oh, let go of my hand. I thought you liked it when I hurt you. You're drunk. Get out. I ran all the way over here. Yeah, well, then run all the way back again. There's no games here tonight. Playtime is over, sonny. Oh, shit! Are you deaf? I told you the game's over. Butt out! Don't you understand? This is nightmare night. The end-of-the-fuckin'-world night. All the bugs and the bats and the goblins are coming out tonight... and no one can stop them! Mary? I'm over here! Stay where you are. I'll find you. Keep talking, Mary. Otherwise I'll lose you. I'm over here! I can hear you. Ah, there you are. Come sing a song of joy For peace shall come my brother I'm sorry. I must have your attention. It's very urgent that I find the Sheffields. Where have you been? I've been running around looking for you everywhere. I've been waiting for ages. Where have you been? It's a big forest to cover. Where's your husband? How dare you! You have no right barging in like this. There's a young girl butchered in a phone box not half a mile from here. Now where is he? I don't know what you're talking about. You have no right being here. Now get out. Get out! The next one you're not gonna hear. Now I'll ask you once more. Where is he? I don't know! I don't know! Lovers' lane. The woods... where is it? Uh, across the campus beyond the school auditorium. Mary, I meant what I said. I do love you. Is that why you phoned me? But you phoned me. At least your friend Linda did. What are you talking about? Well, Linda, she called me at the gas station earlier on. Get away from him! Get away from him! Freeze! Right there. Is he okay? I think so. Kevin! Kevin! No! I said you would be the last. Almost. Myles! Virginia? No, Mr. Sheffield. God knows I've tried to stop you. Aaah! And now I hope he will forgive me. Get away! Sister! Mary. You shouldn't be out here... with a boy. You know better than that. You should have more pride. My God. Sheffield.
