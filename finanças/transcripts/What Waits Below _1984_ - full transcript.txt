25fps The Earth is 6 billion years old. Goliath, the largest known stalagmite in the world is over 900,000 years old. Formed drop by drop it grew at the rate of one inch for every 1250 years. To it's present height of 60 feet, or six stories. 250 years ago the difference in it's height was only the thickness of an orange peel. 2,500 years ago, before Jesus Christ was born in Bethlehem... The difference in it's height was only the depth of a cigarette carton. 900,000 years ago. When the first drop of water fell on the cave floor. And Goliath began to form. Man as we know him today emerged. And began to chip flints to make tools. Goliath. One of the wonders of the Earth. Who can say what other such splendors might exist in caverns as yet unknown to man. Forming...in the darkness, throughout all time. What Waits BELOW Directed by Don Sharp Somewhere in Nicaragua. The Present. George. Just what the hell are you doing here? Well I aint on a Club Med vacation! Well. If they saw us we... - We can kiss our asses goodbye. - Relax Wolf, nobody saw me. Especially the goon that I liberated this uniform off of. Hey eh, guv'ner. Care for a beer? Oh come on, it's not even cold! Cover me George. Go! Go George! Move it! Buenos dios amigos! cigaros! Nope, not that way. Return fire! Not so fast George. - You want a lift? - And I was beginning to get worried. What the hell are you doing here anyway? Give you a job, you can name your own price! Oh and I haven't told you the best thing... Caves, huge mothers and no ones ever been in 'em. What the hell is this? - Copper mines. - Is there a way out? I'm working on it. These guys don't give up Caves. Big caves. If nobody's been in them... how do you know they're there? Tests. Major Stevens will show you. Hasn't anybody fragged that bastard yet? Omega base camp. Belize, South America. Twelve hours later. Well there may be caves around here but I don't see any way in. A minor snag, we thought we found a way in but it turned out to be a dead end. - Stevens put himself out on a limb again did he? - Just like old times, huh? And if you and I don't find an entrance, he's going to get passed over again. Tempting, isn't it? What's this black spot on the map? Anthropologists, a team of them have been excavating there, Stevens drove 'em out. - Too bad you're late, Ben Gannon was with them. - What, THE Ben Gannon? I don't think he knows anything about these caves though. Ben Gannon can smell a cave. That's too bad, I would liked to have met him. I'm not overjoyed to have you here Wolfsen, unfortunately for you we need your experience. Unfortunately for you, I need the money. What's all this about? Have you heard of Omega Stations? Extra-low frequency to send out long very slow radio waves that can be picked up just about anywhere. Yeah. A group of transmitters, strategically placed to create a network of signals that can be used as a navigational aid by properly equipped...ships And Trident subs. They don't have to surface to pick up the codes. I see you've done your homework. Now our experts have determined this site to be the optimum position for such a transmitter on both strategic and geologic grounds Fine. But what's the hurry? You expecting a war? We're holding world-wide manuevers which provides us with an ideal opportunity to test such a system. A base here will complete the necessary network for those tests. Someone committed this site without first securing a place to transmit? Well, there are... factors involved which you wouldn't understand. I would agree with that. Well agree or not, I intend to see this site operational by the end of those maneuvers. Major. Oh, excuse me major. Major, this is uh, Mr. Wolfsen our speliology expert. Wolfsen, Major Ricardo Castillo, our liason with the local government Major, we are still having a problem with some of the people, especially Dr. Shelley Barwell. Now I told you, get those scientists out. Tell them if they don't withdraw in 24 hours... they'll be removed. Yes, sir. Wolfsen. This is your time schedule. Don't fall a minute behind. Detail! Halt! God how I love the army. - Let me out here. - What do you mean? Where do you think you're going? Gonna fill in that blank spot on the map. Hey, how's it going Frida? Good to see you again. Well look at this. Hey listen, is Ben around anywhere? Let's turn into a nice boy, and I know you don't enjoy doing this, so please say what you have to. Ah hell Frida. You've got to be out of here in 24 hours. Or else we're going to have to move you out, now I don't want to have to do that - but my superior officers - Well then we'll just have to speak to your superior, won't we? Now? Whoops, damn! How's the water? Bracing, it's a great place to cool off. And to practice freestyle diving, that last one was a beaut. Hell of a gentleman you are, you could've jumped in here to save me. Maybe I can't swim. The name's Wolf. Wolf? As in big bad? No, as in Wolfsen. Leslie, as in Peterson. My pleasure. Haven't seen you around here before. You camping or hunting? Neither. I'm acting as a consultant for the army. This yours? All we need is another army half-wit. - Look we can offer you other equally attractive locations. - I'm sure you can, but this isn't a picnic. We're finding exceptional artifacts, millions of years old and we're finding them right here. Dr Shelley. Now, Major Castillo's government must consider economic, political factors. Probing for valuable mineral deposits must take a priority. Since when did limestone become valuable? Major, I don't want to exceed my authority. I'm sorry, a private plane will take you to the capitol where you can appeal to higher authorities. - Now look... - Or I will be forced to revoke your visas. You don't leave us many options, do you. Rita! Rita! - We hit the jackpot, Ben found an opening. - He did? - Yeah! - Where? None of your business. If you'll excuse us Major, we have a lot of packing to do. And I'm sure you'll want to start searching for your...limestone. Don't worry doctor, if there's an opening we'll find it. No matter how long it takes us. We're paying you to make sure it won't take long. Your men have been over these hills for weeks, you haven't found a thing. Ben Gannon knows more about caves than any man alive. It'd be absurd not to ask for his help. Of course I'm sure the navy won't mind holding position 'til you're ready to transmit. Wolf's right sir. Alright, looks like I'm the one without any options. You might lose your meal-ticket. - I'm Dr. Shelley. - Wolfsen I'd say we owe you one. Ah, my swimming coach, am I still on your blacklist? Well, I... guess maybe there are intelligent life forms in the army after all. All the artifacts we've found so far have been concentrated in a single bed of sediment near our camp. Now why just there? Was it the local hotspot in the paleozoic era? Ben thought that the specimens were washed down from somewhere higher up. But all my efforts to find the source were to no avail, the trail led nowhere. Until today. I must be blind. I covered this hillside 4 weeks ago and didn't see a thing. Neither did we. Well there was nothing to see until sometime within the last few days. Your seismic tests must have triggered an inverse rockfall, creating the opening. We can start moving in right away. No, hang on, hang on. The footing down there could be extremely dangerous. Ben's right, the floor's covered with loose rubble. Bring up the gear! Let's do this thing properly. George and I'll get kitted up and take the first look with your permission. Yes of course, of course. - Well then, let's not lose any time. - We'll try not to. Move it, we've only got about 3 hours of daylight left. Slow and easy, this stuff could go any minute. Looks like the slope drops off to a deep shaft. It's snagged, there we go Hey we're getting it. You know this looks an awful lot like that... George, you allright? I don't know. I think I'm upside down. Secure the rope. Can you see bottom? Are you kidding? It's dark as the inside of a cow's third stomach in here. - Better? - Yeah, yeah. Thanks. Rock coming. Now! 2 seconds. About a hundred feet. Don't go away. Stevens, we're ok now. Right. You've got enough rope. We're going down. Line coming. Second line. Got to be a snag. Well what the hell is going on down there? In a cave the only predictable element is the unpredictable. Ok George. You went first last trip. This is my turn. Outcropping here, watch yourself. There George. - On the bottom, taking a look around. - Very good. We're the first. Untouched. Millions of years. 'til us. Wolfsen! Barwell! Report! OK Alice, I guess it's time to leave wonderland. Well what about this large cavern at the bottom? Does it fill our requirements? - Yes sir. - Well excellent. - Sergeant Newman! - Yes Sir! - Were there any artifacts or paintings? - a site this old must have been used as a dwelling sometime in the past. No we didn't have time to see anything. Take your men, start lowering transmitter components for immediate assembly, we'll run a test tonight. Yes sir! Alright men let's go. Major. - I'd like to make a preliminary examination of the site before you and your men cause too much disturbance. - That can not be permitted. The entire cave is off limits to non-essential personnel until all tests are completed. What the hell is this? - You promised that we could go down there and complete out work... - I promised...! You could explore. I didn't say when. Well when? It may be days, it may be weeks. Not until the mission is accomplished. And if the army decide to make a permanent installation here it may be never. Possibly. Wait a minute. Hey, this entire site could be ruined by the time you and your men are through. Parker! -Sir! Johnson! - Yo! Clemens! - Yes sir! White, front and center! Escort Doctor Shelley, Mr. Gannon and Miss Peterson to their camp. Major. Why don't you just take them into the forest and repatriate them? I seem to remember that being your style in Viet Nam. Wolfsen. Your presence is no longer required here. Gather your gear. Clear out. One last cup, wanna share? It's not bad, this local stuff. I could've got used to it. Could have? Do you know we've gone through 4 bottles tonight? Hardly enough for a wake. Cheer up. There'll be other caves. I've never known a mercenary before. I thought they umm... they had tattoos. Wore eyepatches. Oh, I'm not so much of a mercenary. More a specialist. I'm not particularly good at taking orders no matter what the price. Yeah, I noticed. What, exactly... do you specialize in? Lots of things. And you? Maybe we specialize in some of the same things? You must be good at your job to be with Ben and Frida, how'd you get into it? My boyfriend was an anthro major. The Anthropology stuck. He didn't. Why grandma, what a big tongue you have. All the better to... Damn. You know this place is so big. It really shouldn't bother me. But it's being underground you see, it's... Like a grave. Sit, tell me about America. Can't tell you about all of America, it's a pretty big place, I wouldn't know where to start. Tell me about where you came from, your home place. Hometown? - Hometown. - I'm from Richmond, it's a little town in the northern part of Missouri. Like I say it's a small town, it's in a really beautiful part of the state. Do they have a forest, like here? What the hell is that? Omega base! Come in! Come in please. Omega base. Help, are you there? Help, please help me are you there? Hey Jim, Jim do you read me? Jim! Jim! Do you read me Jim? Jim! Something wrong sargent? We've lost contact sir. Damn. So c'mon sir, what the hell happened last night? Who knows, the CO looked like he could chew nails. - Talk to ya later. - Yeah, catch you later. Last night. Our installation in the cave was... attacked. Two men on guard are missing, the transmitter has... disappeared. The men stationed at the entrance. swear that no came in or went out. So the transmitter must be somewhere in the cave. But there is no other entrance. There has to be. Someone took the transmitter. Someone who knew it's value, and someone who knew it was there. - And you want someone to help you find it? - Yes! Dammit. - Any coffee left? - Yeah. And the two men. I am aware of the resentment you feel. Perhaps I used a little less tact than I should have but I'm a soldier not a diplomat. Haven't you got that mixed up? Diplomats are supposed to be the ones you can't trust. Your point is well taken. Please. Please. Lt. Barwell has already explained the difficulties of exploring these caves without expert guidance. I assure you, we're completely at the mercy of you and your colleagues. Colleagues? Hey, I'm not taking civilians down there, we don't know what we're dealing with. - Dammit Wolf, I feel the same way that you do but we can't do this...we can't do this alone. - It's out of the question. Uh, Wolf. I'm touched by the concern of you and your military friends for... the safety of us incompetent and cowardly civilians but um... speaking personally and purely selfishly, I'd like to go. I want to find out whats down there. Right. When we get down there, what I say goes! No contact, no confrontation until all civilians are out, agreed? All right. We leave in two hours. Only 3 army personnel, George is one. - Lieutenant, you and I'd better get ready. - Yes sir. We'll take Sgt. Newman. I have a young soldier, Santos. Santos Arias he, he has explored the caves in our country many times. Yeah, we'd welcome his help, thank you. You don't trust him, do you? No. He operates pretty close to the edge. I have no idea what's going to happen when we get down there. - Where's Barwell? - He went ahead to scout. - Oh, you must be Major Castillo's caving expert. - Santos Aries - Forget the salute, glad to have you along. - Gracias They didn't go this way, dead ends about 300 yards in. Well, makes things easy. We'd better get started. Everybody ready? We are. Well let's go. Sergeant, fix your helmet. Everybody in a single line, nobody wander off alone. And don't bother searching passageways too small to take the transmitter. Take it easy now, the ledge is narrowing. Freeze! Some kind of light up there. Wait here, I'll check it out. - Wonder how deep it is down there? - Look out, that could be hundreds of feet deep. What the hell's taking Wolfsen so long? Come on. You won't need your light in here. I'll be a son of a gun. Never have I seen this in a cave before. Stars of death. Are they poisonous? That's what they call these glowworms in the Waitomo caves in New Zealand. Arachnocampa luminosa it's the larva of a fly. It secretes this luminous mucus to attract and capture it's prey. Arachnocampa luminosa. Shouldn't we keep moving? The major's right, let's move on. We'll have to split up, search as many passages as possible. And stay with your group, after a while these formations are going to start looking alike. Yes, let's not search anything twice. Ben, you take Frida, George and Newman. That way. I'll take the others...there. We'll regroup in two hours. Must be an underground river behind that wall. - How far do you think we are below the surface? - I'd say a mile in. - Maybe a thousand feet down. - Dead end, move on. They could never have got the transmitter up there. Let's mark this one off. We've used up an hour already. This doesn't go anywhere. Wolfsen, times up. You're right, back we go. - Our time's just about up, better get back. - Wait a minute. I think I've got something. Major, this is from the transmitter. We found these not far away. That's an integrated circuit, that must be yours. No it's not off the transmitter, I'm sure of that. In fact I've never seen any electrical component like it. - Let's see where you found this, soldier. - Right this way sir. Here, here. This is where we found the transmitter part. Right, same procedure. Search and meet back here. Let's go take the far one. Frida, you alright? I think so, but I can't see where I am. Hold on, I'll light a flare. Right, let's start at the beginning. This is the skeleton of a male, aged between 30 and 40 years. Death probably due to an accident. But what's he doing here? How'd he get in? Maybe some old explorer came in the same way we did. A little unprepared, no clothes. Well, perhaps he lost his way, starved to death. His remains may have been here for over a century. Come on Frida, surely he's been here longer than that. No, no. I think Frida's right, I'd say between 100 and 150 years. This is certainly interesting. Advanced case of hydrocephalus. We stay here much longer, we're going to end up like that clown ourselves. Feel free to press on ahead if it'll make you feel better. You'd like that, wouldn't you? Oh if I wandered off...got lost. Who'd sign my paycheck? Let's move. Hey! Hey stop! I saw somebody, over there. - Ben, Frida, did you see anything? - No - George? - Nah, her yell scared the wits out of me though. Somebody was there, right behind that stalagmite. Maybe it was White, or Lopez. Maybe this place drove them crazy and they're just wandering around down here. Everybody, up here. - See anyone? - No. But there's a handprint in that fungus. George, take Newman and set up a marker where we found our dead friend. Leslie, what you saw, could that have been White or Lopez? I'm sorry, I couldn't tell. But somebody was there. Next time you see anything, don't yell just give us a nod and we'll check it out. Ok, I'll try. This is crazy. Wolf, hey come here. What is it George? Look. - Did you leave that marker? - No - Where's Newman? - Here sir. This passageway's been marked too. But that's where we came in. No no. Pardon, the senorita is wrong sir. We came from over there. Well. Where did we come from? What's going on? - What are you trying to pull? - Nobody's trying to pull anything major. You were the last one in here. Now think major, we've all been together. When would I have had time to build a pile of stones over there or down there?. Then which one is it? Or are we lost? No major we're not lost. He came through here. I'm sure Ben will be able to tell you where he came in. Yes of course I can, down there. But we didn't mark that passage either. It's not a dead end. Who did it? Maybe someone who uh... doesn't want us to get out of here. That would seem to be the most likely explanation. George, lose the stones from these two passages, we better move on. Leslie. Wait just a minute. Right, we have to decide whether to go on or not. - We must, that other poor man is still down there. - and he could still be alive. - I must find that transmitter. - and we've got one dead already, probably two. No we can't turn back now. There's a man lost in here somewhere, and there are extremely important anthropological considerations also. I don't give a damn about anthropology! - Now I have a mission to accomplish. - Well what about the other soldier? If he is still alive I'll get him out. And that's with or without... your help. We'll pick up Hector's body on the way back. What was that? Jesus. You all stay here. I'm right behind you, sergeant. Stay with the group. We've got to get a tourniquet around this. The other soldier sir. - He's there. He's dead sir. - Wolf - Let's get out of here. - he's dead sir. - Come on let's go. Let's go! Someone really should go back with Santos. - Yes, I'll take him and catch you up later. - No. No we can't let anyone go back. If we hope to recover that transmitter. - It's ok, I'll go alone. - No, you can't do that. - No please, I'm alright now. It's my fault for what happened. Santos can handle it, can't you soldier. Trying to make it? Yes sir. Ok, take it easy. Farewell Santos. Take care. Here you go, it shouldn't jam on you again. Good luck. Take care. {brief spanish prayer} What do you want? We'll take 10 here. Sergeant. Time's running out. Let's keep looking. Come on. Oh great. What next? Need any help? No, I'm ok. Leslie. Leslie! Hey Wolf, look, look here, look. It's a path. - That noise. George, you two stay here. - Look out, it could be a trap. Ben, wait a minute. Come and take a look at this. - What do you make of it? - I don't know. Never seen anything like it. Wolf. It's a loom. Yeah, but what's it doing here? It's not synthetic. It's hair. Oh yeah? How many haircuts did it take to make this? Over here. Ben. More of that strange componentry that Newman couldn't make out. Electronic circuitry and stone age tools. What does this have to do with Leslie and the transmitter? What do you think that is? Originally? A leg bone. Look how it's been hollowed out at the end. It's like a woomera. A Woomera? Yeah, it's a weapon. Austrailian aboriginees use them. Put a dart or a stone in there. Hey. Try one of these, ouch. - You make them out? - No. That way. They must have evolved. In a highly specialized way in order to survive in an environment like this. Take cover, hurry. They're right behind us. Ch-rist, what's this? Not unless you have to George. Ben, take Frida and make a run for it. Get out of here. Somebody's coming, quick hide over there. - Who are those spooks? - Quiet. I don't know. But those scientists, they've known something all along. Look. I knew it. We're on to something big, look at this place. Sergeant. The transmitter. Well? Quick man! Is it in working order? It wired...these freaks, they've screwed it all up. Can you fix it? - Tridents will be moving into position in about 45 minutes and we can still transmit on schedule. - I'll do what I can. Look at their reaction, fired the gun. Their hearing must be far more sensitive than ours. The high energy low frequency of the transmitter must have hurt like hell that's why they went for it. Look, Leslie. Ben, do you think they could have any diseases they could transmit? Far more likely they'll catch something from her. My god these people have been isolated for thousands of years. They've got Frida and George. Who in the hell's that? Must be the leader. What are we gonna do Wolf? Wait, we haven't been heard yet. Don't forget, we're the aggressors here. Time to get in amongst it. Stay close to George. You ok? Watch this, George. - I got it. - Good. Set the timer for 04:00 hours. Take cover! Go George. You, ugly! Frida! - What about Frida? - Keep going. Rest in here. It's off the path, they won't be able to sense you. I'll go up and see if it's safe up ahead. Here. Oh am I glad to see you. We've got to stop meeting like this. Where's Ben and Frida? Dead. Those things are right behind us, we've got to get out of here. Come on, no time for that now. Stand by Major The transmitter. We can't hear it but they can. - George, they're going for the transmitter. - Stevens. Sergeant, take cover. All of them must be coming! Get out, get out! Turn it off you fool! - Major, what the hell's going on? - Are we still transmitting? Yes sir. Look. Wait here. We got him. You've done it. They received your signal. What has happened? Where are the others? They're dead. The caves are unsafe. When Stevens turned on the transmitter. the cavern collapsed. We can't do the Omega project here Major. Not under any circumstances. The bodies. Can we recover the bodies? No. Seal the caves Major. Permanently. If it's alright with you sir, I'll give you a complete report later. Timing by Eazin Subtitles by Maestro
