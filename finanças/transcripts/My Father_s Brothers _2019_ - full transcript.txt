We had been out on a search and the battalion had called down and told us to move to a because they would have move us back to a base area. And from there we would launch into. And as we were getting ready to go back, and we're moving in a column of twos cutting our way through the jungle. And we had stopped. And all the way back down the line, each of the following three platoons are broken out column. And then about every hour, and we'd stop and. And each platoon would put or the left flank to in case the enemy slipped up on us. I remember standing up. And we began to move out. And way back in the back, his name was Fritz, and he went up to squad. "We've left the two guys back." They haven't come back in, And the squad leader just sort of I mean, the troop is moving, And he said, "Oh, it's okay, They'll be here." And so we moved. And so after a while, and went up to the next guy and all this time we're still moving. And finally the patrol leader he says, "Sir", And so we halted the column and I went back to where and we sent a fire team of five guys out to see if they were still there. And there they were about 50 yards out, laying down on a trail protecting us and we'd gone off and left them. I turned to Fritz, and there was the squad and on either side of his collar. He was a Sergeant. And I took his stripes off of him and I said, "You're relieved." And I turned around and there was Fritz, the guy who had alerted us, and I reached down and pined the stripes. "Fritz, you're a Sergeant." And he did. He had them dig deep that night, had them check their grenades, make sure everything was safe. He would be killed on the 29th of June. That's my father in 1966. He survived two tours of Vietnam and three helicopter crashes over there. He commanded troops in combat with the 173rd Airborne Brigade. He earned the Silver Star, the Army's third highest hon our the Distinguished Flying Cross the Bronze Star for valour in combat, which he earned seven times, and the Purple Heart for. That's me in 1966. For most of my life, I really had. Yes, I knew he had been in Vietnam, I thought he had a desk job over there. I suppose I was like a lot of. You took what your. He didn't talk about the war. During a recent trip to the I started asking him questions and he agreed to tell me. It seems like all my life I was prone to something to. At an early age I went to in St. Petersburg, Florida, and then for college. As soon as I graduated, in the Army, and then I was off. And it seemed to me that if I wanted to advance, if I wanted to learn about being an infantry officer, about being an Army officer, I needed to be where the battle was. And I requested assignment to. And that was all well and and told my wife what I had done. Then my husband came home for Vietnam and he. And I thought, I didn't know volunteering for Vietnam or I think maybe telling me he volunteered was the craziest thing. In fact, I remember very clearly I wrote down on a piece of paper, I promise I will not. My dad invited me to go to the 173rd to meet some of the men so I would have a better understanding of what they experienced. It had been 50 years since they had been in Vietnam together. I got out of high school in I joined the Army. I went down to a recruiter. My dad was a career Marine. My mom and dad had to sign off when I got out of high school and, I was drafted, I got my high and my draft papers in the other and I was off and running I enlisted in the army still in high school. I'd always wanted to and I wanted to become a I had started working at right out of high school and. Was drafted about a year later. I was graduating high and a good friend of mine decided, that we wanted to enter the military. I joined shortly after high school. It was a 4th of July. I was out with some of the and we weren't paying attention to and we hit the back of the and we locked our bumpers together. So my dad said it'd be a good idea to go and talk to him and apologize. He sat me down at a. We started talking and right I'll never forget it. It was a poster of a Golden. I went home that night. "So what'd you do today? I said, "I did." He said, "Where?" I said, "United States Army." I had a buddy that had agreed to go in the military cause we were both in the lottery and he was a student. And September when I got I called him and he said, My grades are good and I'm. Well, I had my doubts about that. Gus wasn't a good student. But Gus got drafted and. And when he came home for Christmas, I was home from advanced infantry. And Gus was having a hell of a time cause that military school. So he didn't go back to Fort Benning. He committed suicide on. And his funeral was on Monday and I had to be back at Fort Jackson, so I missed his funeral. So I started my whole army career out with one of the biggest traumas you can imagine in your life. Getting to Saigon when was a really exciting experience, but you didn't know what to expect. And they ushered us into and they put us in a circus tent. The mortars hit the tent and and there was a lot of. So they got who was able. We loaded buses and left Saigon, 40 or 50 miles an hour right. And our first look at Saigon was just by the lightning flashes. There was a heavy storm. Appropriate for us. I got to A Company on March 15th, 1966. The next morning I got up, I was on my way to breakfast and there was a couple of guys listening to the firefight that. That was my first experience with even being associated I can remember my response to the Company armourer at the time. I said, "I don't even." And he said, "Just wait a." Well, when I first got there, They had a major engagement while we were down in Tan Son Nhut and they were coming and got ambushed on a I don't know how many were killed, but many, many were wounded. And so when we got up there, When we first got in the Company area, we heard some choppers coming all the guys that had started coming in and they. And the looks on their faces, Everybody looked like and nobody talked or anything. It was just pretty damn scary. And then they came back and and then I was the FNG. Yeah, but it was an experience. Great group of guys. Made some of the best. That was my first night in Vietnam and I spent about probably before it got daylight and I got up and started looking around. It was a desolate place. All them old tents looked but nobody lived in them but. That's where we'd go get rested up and take a shower and get our C-rations and the brass would get the orders and we'd load up and go out and do another search and destroy. That's about all we did. The officers had their own officers club and they kept their liquor. We were coming back and noticed that the hinges were pinned on the outside of the door with a padlock on the handle, so we took the pins out, went in and stole a whole box of liquor, different bottles, They never realized anything was gone, so we did it again at. The third time we went back, the hinges were on the. Now, that was fantastic. That was probably the funniest that we got away with the. After about three weeks in the country, for a week at a time or more and spend a few days. Your first patrol when you're just nervous what the hell you're looking for, And you think any moment you're gonna get ambushed and blown up. Triple canopy was but you heard every little bug, insect. It was constant, you were soaking wet all the time from sweat. As time went on, the old guys for a month or two would and what you're doing and that were gonna keep you alive. You caught on quick. It was a matter of life. So I was on radio watch one night, Sergeant Brown was over here, I was next to him and spread out a little bit. And I heard this strange noise coming and it was in the trees. I couldn't figure out what it was. And it got louder and it got. So finally I woke up. "Sergeant Brown, Sergeant Brown, I don't know what it is." And he looked at me and he said, "It's monkeys, get under your poncho." And so we rolled over under the poncho I mean, it must've been and they're crapping on you. And finally they left and he said, "Okay, you can come up now." And we were just covered. And I said, "Does this happen often?" He said, "Yeah, every once in a while you'll get stuck with it." And he said, "They just and they're extremely noisy." And it was a little bit terrifying to me because I had no clue what. You moved along in areas hopefully where you had a lot of cover. Many movies depict infantry and moving across open fields. We did our best to never do that unless there was no other way to do it. Sometimes you had to and unless you wanted to spend you had to go across it. You tried to avoid any trails and that's when you really for trip wires or pits. Most of the patrols were very slow. If they weren't slow, The reason they were slow is. You had to put out flank security, security in the rear. You had maybe a couple of point men that would go ahead and and look for enemy and. Whenever the point man he would stop and you'd investigate it. And sometimes you get yelled. "Move it up, move it up, move it up." And to your people. "Yeah, you're not down here." You move as fast as you safely can. We seem to just hit a lot. There was always guys leaving and new guys coming in. Young kids, we were all 18, 19 years old and you got very close. Tried not to 'cause you didn't cause it'd hurt when they got killed but you couldn't help but make friends. It wasn't about communism; It was about being airborne infantry. I was an enlisted forward observer. It was just an adventure and I was having a good old time. And then when you get in a fight, I don't think the reality of war had really struck any of us. All our middle names were John Wayne and we were gonna end all this crap. And that lasted until that. Then reality did strike. And the orders came we were gonna leave out I passed it down to my platoon leaders, "Once we're there, I want each I want the first platoon I want the second platoon I want the third platoon to remain and then I'm gonna keep under Lieutenant Vendetti. Once battalion clears us, I want each of you three platoon leaders to start moving to the west to see if you can find. The battalion commander a thousand meters apart. It's gonna be a problem later on. If we're a thousand meters apart and each company was doing that as well, we would cover more area. We would have a chance to screen out to make sure we didn't. Did you want your platoons to be a thousand meters apart? No. We never did it again. June 28th, we had come to this area, we'd been moving around and we came to this area. Now, my platoon was set up on a ridge. There was a valley, there was. It went into a village and a road and there was a road that came. And when we got off the helicopter, it was dry next to a where we were supposed and it was supposed to before we made the charge on the 29th. But when we got in the rubber trees and we got comfortable and got ready for the rain, some of the second platoon. They had been in a mess and they were worn out and they did a lot of stuff. So they told us to go and they were gonna take our position and rest up in the perimeter. So that kind of pissed everybody off. And I had just gotten my tent set up and I couldn't wait to get my boots off and get in there and before I had to do guard duty. And they came up and I. "Now this is my place and it's put you own up but with them muddy boots. We had had lots of villagers cause there was this trail. And they weren't armed. And I remember seeing pieces of white tape on some of the bike tires, which we at the time. Cause I learned this later going back, this is how they did it. Count the number of revolutions of the tire multiplied times the and you've got the distance. A rough distance from where you've got. Right when the sun was breaking, we received two mortars, I don't think it was one, right in our lines. It a killed Jesse Felder. And all we heard was the bloop, It was a mad rush to get our dead cause I helped carry Felder and his arm fell out, hit me on the leg. I went on the LP and I was out. It never occurred to me to where we were until we went back in the morning of the 29th. It was my hammock that the and Felder died from the mortar blast. And that's where I'd have been if they hadn't taken our position. If they'd have been on LP, I would have been there. So I had that to think we got on the chopper that day. And I remember us going to another area, and then being split up into platoons. I met some Lrps, that were there because they briefed me and they told me they'd and they hadn't seen a thing. Now, knowing now what I know now, how they didn't see. I don't know how they did it because there was a whole large. He said, we've been out and it's pretty quiet. And as he was getting on the chopper. He said, "Oh, by the way," he said, "There's an old path over there and there's some footprints. We couldn't find the end of it." And he said, "Oh yeah, one more thing. There's some commo wire out there." And he said, "We never. And all of a sudden I'm like, "Hmm." It had rained for two days previously, and so we started out I believe, four groups, but I was part of third platoon and we were probably out for I use the word stumbled, Vietcong battalion base camp. We had come across some trails and it was pretty muddy and. The front squad had noticed a latrine that would be used for a larger element. We were getting ready to and the firing started. Don't remember exactly, but maybe four or five shots. And then shortly after that, It was horrendous gun fire. And they just opened up on. Small arms, machine guns, pretty much wiped out the. The first time we knew that was not because of radio we could hear it. And then the communications and the platoon began to and it was a large force and within 30 or 40 minutes. They were in deep trouble. Sergeant Morris came back and I believe he was wounded and told us to dig in the best we could. I remember trying to dig but it kept filling with water. From then on, the firing. That's the thing I remember the most. The sound of the 50 calibres. Even the trees falling. I was probably. They shot the two guys on point and people were hit left and right. And there was an ant hill. And I laid down behind that thing. I think that cord will probably. And he had it stretched as far as it would go and standing up, talking on the radio. Next time the fire came, it hit him. And I remember turning around and his rifle was slung on his shoulder. And it looked like to me and his arm was hanging on. We heard gunfire; It was quick. It was very fast. It was (mimicking gun. And right away I knew from that that's not a good thing cause then you know what's coming next. And then all of a sudden. And they were calling for. "We're surrounded, we need help." And Captain Kelley was on he just told all of us, "Everybody now, We're all gonna kind of converge and see what we can do to that was in so much trouble. We just moved out. We'd never run that fast with rucksacks on our. And when we got close had us drop our rucksacks. And I have no idea who it was. He said, told somebody. To guard them. And at the time I thought, "God, I wish that would have been me." Later I'm sort of glad, who would want to be left out I'm so glad it wasn't me. You'd see a grenade come and come in and you'd. The mortar rounds were worse, and then you just had to wait and try and hear it come through the trees. The enemy actually. This was a battalion size unit against this platoon of 30 or 40 guys. To this day, the gunpowder smell, the smoke. Everywhere you looked, bodies, the wounded. Some of the guys that took some hits that were probably really and, unfortunately, that just drew fire and most of those ended just because of that. There's two things that. One was, "Medic," and the other was... There were several that would say, I distinctly remember tracer rounds hitting between myself and the M60. At that point I was hit in front of us and stunned me. And I went the rest of the. Then we came across some. We thought that'd be a good place to be. And as soon as we got close to them, they really opened up on us. They had that whole area covered. We moved back and at that time I knew I was in trouble just 'cause I couldn't get my breath and I could hear the. So I had something... My lung was opened up. Luckily it was just one. There was a big termite mound, probably a four foot in diameter by three foot high dirt mound. And I started pulling. Hido and Fritz, they were the first two and they were pretty shot up. Fritz was just bleeding out. There wasn't much I could he was missing an arm. I tried to get that stopped. "It's getting so dark in here, And I kept trying to get and he just bled out. I was in a position where I that was happening and I had my radio and then I made contact with the artillery folks and that lasted about 10 minutes, putting in some test rounds to sort of get a bearing. And my estimate was, they were. So I told them to drop a hundred and they got in a discussion with me and I found out later had done a couple of but they got in a discussion with me about whether that would be too close. And at the time, this horrific fight and my response to him was, "We're on the point of being overrun, drop a hundred and fire, And then they tried to overrun us. They first opened up and then the 50s and fired. One of the rockets landed right in the middle of us. I remember an arm flying by me. Then that's when they really opened up. Fortunately, we were able to repel that. Someone said, "Why isn't." And I said, "It's because. He said, "Bring the radio over." And so it was about 40, 50, 60 feet. And so I left. By that time, my M16 was jammed. So I was in between. And I actually left the and I went across this area. They had deep bunkers, overhead cover that they had built in, trenches going from position to position so they could move about and fire. I remember that several of my guys reported that they had, they had cut out through the brush so that they could fire through that and they still had protection and camouflage so that. And I took the radio and first thing he said before he says, "Where's your rifle?" I said, "Back jammed behind the tree." Then he said, "Okay." He said, "You leave the radio here" and you get back and put that. So I went back and I but I was in a process when I got shot the first time. Then we were getting low on ammo. So I was crawling up front, and taking the ammo off the dead guys. Also, taking battle dressings off of them, because we were all out of those and the wounded guys needed. First time I get shot, I got shot in all I was doing, I couldn't breathe. It was like blood in and blood out. That was the time that I. Next thing I remember is James Miskel on the other side of the M60. He pulled the plastic wrap. He packed the wound with gauze or whatever was available and he put the plastic over that and then wrapped it tightly. When I had been hit, I was having a lot of trouble breathing cause both bullets had and both had hit ribs. And then all of a sudden I had. And I did what 50% of the people did. I called for the medic and someone, I don't know who, And we were out of morphine and the medic had been killed and there was none left in his bag. So I went up farther up and that's where Charlie and some of the other guys were. And what had happened in this right-hand pocket and I had been hit and when I pulled the compass out first, it was all gnarled where. And then the bullet came out up above. And I had this big where the bullet came out. But what it had been, and the only way I can describe it is if you take a baseball bat and just hit someone in the chest. That's how it felt. And the bullet went out. It was deflected, I believe, by the compass because the I dropped the compass. It would have been the but that's what you do. And I dropped the compass. And I thought everything. And I didn't have the rifle but then right after that, and then I got shot twice in the back. I was out of it for a little bit, but I do remember being pretty much the rest of the time, and getting weaker as the time went on. Remember being very low or out of ammo. It was real apparent that and that I needed to get out of there. And there were two two black guys that were. And they said, "Why don't come over here?" And I can remember, and it wasn't the brightest but I asked him something like, And they said, "Get the F over here." So I crawled over there I couldn't stand up any more. And that's where I spent. As we were moving towards them, And we were getting very close to them and then there was a I couldn't tell you how many and they started shooting at us. And one of them was blind from and one of them had been and of one of them's name was Leon Exum. The other one, And all we had left, they had. There was an M79 grenade launcher. So the three of us in kind put that M79 into play. And I had been shot in the right side but I can put my arm up like that. The guy that was blind actually propped the M79 grenade launcher on my elbow. And the guy who had been who owned the M79, he actually gave the guidance and we would pop off a round. We did this until we. What I do know is the Vietcong, they have the same routine because we were causing some damage because after the rounds would go off, There was a small gully as long as we didn't stand up, we could crouch down and move along. And when we got toward where we could get out of it, everybody checked their self, got ready to go. And that's when John. He went up out of the ravine and as soon as he got both he got killed. Shot in the neck. When the third platoon initially it was because their some enemy latrines and. The point squad was led by. He immediately found it, told him the enemy was there. No sooner had they reported that, and eventually they got surrounded. But Morris again took his squad, He found the enemy was firing at him. He and two other guys moved out behind from where they were and. Later on, the enemy put a 50 calibre and tried to put it in. He and another guy, The other guy was killed in action, I remember him coming back to us and I'm fairly certain he was, but he was probably seriously and he spent most of his time at that... From that point forward, he spent most of his time working with that group, although he continually made rounds, made sure everybody was okay. Assigning firing lanes. Making sure everybody had areas covered. But Morris was, he was an. He was an infantryman and intended to do everything to make the mission work. He was that kind of guy. I can remember Charlie at the Vietcong saying, "Come on, I've only got one good." And they were actually. And I believe that it was as a paratrooper, as a warrior. It uplifted me to hear. Me and somebody that came up behind. Show alter advanced toward the fire and we didn't go that far before we ran into Morris and Coney. And Morris looked like a pin cushion and it looked like he. Both of them did. He would be hit at least by individual weapons fire and he'd be covered with or other mines or things like that. He was wounded. I tried to get Charlie and he was having no part of that. And he said, "No, I'm staying right here until everybody else is gone." Morris didn't want to go out. Your adrenaline is going crazy, your heart's pumping is get there because. You want to get there; And I could hear, I could hear some of the radio and they were really in a point where it was almost over for them. Now, I know we were very low. And the only ammo I had. And then we were really. And I was stacking dead bodies. That was gonna be our final stand. The guys that were wounded... We all had grenades and very few rounds. So the next time they hit, we'd get as many of them as we could and then use the grenades on ourselves. But thank God we didn't have to. The enemy react to what you do. And that's what your job is as is to communicate with that makes them think that you have more guns than they do or you're badder than they are, and they're gonna get. The Vietcong, one of their any time they felt that they would immediately. These guys were professional soldiers. They weren't gonna stay I didn't have a battalion, So I figured the only way we're is to make them think. So I took my 20 to 30 guys which is a very, cause there was nobody behind them. But I put them all on line. I took the two M60 machine guns so I could concentrate the fire and we just move forward like you see in the. Move forward in a single firing like hell with and darn if it didn't do the trick. The NVA or VC, the enemy, than we were because generally the way you tell how big a unit is, A platoon usually has. A company will have. A battalion could have 18 to 20, depending how broad it was, just moving through a jungle area. And I wanted them to think. And obviously they did because. We were just laying there waiting to hit them one more time. I could hear the steps and I was kind of zeroed in on that. And then all of a sudden come out of the brush. Damn good feeling. When we finally got to third platoon, the first person I saw was Mike St urges. First platoon had made it into us. The first guy out was Woody Davis. And he looked up at me and that's when I've at that time where he was thinking, "If I could just get up." And then later we were and he told me that he and until he saw the top of my helmet, he was gonna use those six. He could hear me coming, So that's when I said maybe. "Thank God I didn't pull." At the time, I didn't know Woody. I know they just secured, new medics got us patched up. He got medevaced. And the next time I saw him was at. We were standing at one end of the bar and this guy kept staring. The reason I knew it was fussing with his boot or. And he looked up, and I said, "Holy shit." Yeah. And then he just dropped his. And he says, "You don't. And I'm like, "No." And he said, "I'm Woody." He said, "I was the first." And he said, "I'll never forget" the look on your face of. We've shared a lot of beers since then. And then I realized that we were really. There was riblets of blood in it. Sorry. And then we started seeing teeth. And what I mean by that is we started seeing gray faces smiling, it was the third platoon. First thing I saw when was five bodies laying I mean, it was just horrible. The ground was moist, soggy, discoloured, and I didn't realize it. For a while it took me to partially on top of one. He was dead. There was so much dirt, I didn't even realize I was. And that's where I spent. It was just a really, really bad day, especially for those guys. When I got up to Morris and Cooney, there that were either moaning or there was somebody trying and it was just a mess, it was carnage, but the fighting was over. That's when the realization really just slapped. God darn, it was... One of my buddies that I Carl Fishburne, We were talking about and he said, "Is that the night we." Yeah. Somebody was on the radio calling for medevacs and stuff so you couldn't land any choppers. They cleared an to drop a basket down. I remember being loaded. Some of the unique that you normally don't think of is our Chaplain, Conrad Walker. When the battle took place, When we eventually got our landing, where we're gonna lift and winch and things like that. He carried just about I joined him, but we carried but he was with every one of them. We called him our shepherd. But all the people we the Chaplain loaded them. That helicopter had a spotlight. I don't see how he could but we threw smoke and he put the gurney and we'd load it and he'd pull it up and all day until we. The battle for most part is over now. We got some sniper fire coming. They haven't completely given up. And while we're carrying we'd bring the helicopter but again, it would and we would tie one of our and they would just. Not infrequently, but a lot of times we'd. And they'd just about drop the guy. They'd say, "Well here", And the Chaplin would say, "It's okay." It's okay. Don't worry about it. Just bring him on up here. We'll get him on this helicopter. So even under fire, he didn't move. He was there. He was a rock. For his action on that day, he would get the Silver. One brave guy. I wasn't medevaced out. They put me in a body bag and then tied the rope and lifted me out. I don't know which was worse, the firefight or dangling on just knowing that there and they were gonna open fire. Then I saw a clearing and there was a dust. It felt like we were doing but that pilot just right next to the medevac and, off I went. It was really a relief to. To know I was back on the. I remember them working on me. Sticking a large tube in my side and I probably passed or either they put me out. Cause the next thing I, at least another day, And I never saw those guys again. And that's sort of the nature of what happens in a you go to one hospital, I ended up in Japan for 108 days and that's why I have one picture of me and that's because all my pictures were in the base camp and. None of my equipment ever I enjoy coming here to these events because it's important, it's an opportunity to touch with people because like I say, I have one picture. And that's it. So we got into their perimeter and sent my medic over there to start working on the wounded, start assessing the wounded, put men around it to secure the area and started looking and making sure everybody. That's when I found Sergeant Morris. He was laying on his back. He looked dead to me. If I had to bet, I'd say he was dead. He had two sucking chest wounds. I also noticed that his hands... It's why I thought he was dead. His hands were not moving. In each thumb contained grenade pins. He had thrown so many grenades and had been wounded so many times he didn't have the strength to take the pins off his fingers. His thumbs were filled. So, I walked up to him and kicked him. I kicked him in his feet, kicked him in his boots just. He opened his eyes... He opened his eyes and he looked at me and he put his arm up and saluted and he says, "All the way, sir." You could have knocked when he did that. So I went, "Holy shit." And I started yelling for a medic. This guy was above and I remember that on the when we were trying to and get the rest of our killed out, he was wounded and I went by him. And the first platoon and Lieutenant Vose had checked. And I went by him and and he was moving and. How could he... bloodied, he just looked like a sieve. And I said, "Sergeant, are you okay?" And I knelt beside him, and he looked up at me and he reached up and he grabbed me by the collar here. And he'd yanked me down and he said, "Captain." He said, "I want you to I said, "Sure." He said, "Promise me you won't until all the rest of the. Please don't leave anybody behind. Please sir, don't leave anybody behind." And I said, being all knowledgeable, being a captain and knowing everything, I said, "Okay, Sergeant", Cause see, I already. This guy was just shot to pieces. And we lifted him out last. A year later, I received a call. "The President of the United States." Do you think you could come. And I said, "Well", And I went to Washington and I saw the president place around Charlie Morris the Medal of Honour around his neck. And I thought, as great as that was, the thing I remember is not but Morris saying, "Sir, please, Take me out last." My claim to fame in Vietnam. And I would say, look up June 29th, 1966 and look up Charles B. Morris and realize that I had the privilege of. One of the things that there is a horrendous. You don't feel bad necessarily, it's just that you're exhausted because your adrenaline's and so when it stops, you just may pass out or. I was exhausted and I just remember laying down. It was over. I think that what happened we had them surrounded or a and that's when they ran. They took off. Or they didn't realize they I think that was what it was. It was A Company. We ended up having a reputation. They called us No DEROS Alpha. That means that if you were you very possibly didn't get to serve. You left before your one way or another. My wounds weren't bad enough to be evaced out of the country. Got out of the hospital and I think I was in the and got hit again. That was the last one. I got out of there then. I was reading the paper, sitting at the kitchen table one morning and realized I was reading an article about a firefight that. And then pretty soon there was a quote by Captain Jack Kelley who commanded this Company that had been in this. That was really scary, but I thought, at least I'm reading. So I know he made it through it. I didn't enjoy the war. I didn't join, I got drafted and I was doing what a was supposed to do. Go and do what you're told. That's why I went. I wasn't looking for any kind of glory. And do my part and get my ass back home. When I got out of the service, I pretty well just put it behind me. I think it obviously had a. I think I knew what I did not and that was be a PFC. When I came out of high school, I probably would have not. Family really couldn't have. Once I was wounded and became eligible to go under the Disability Act, which pretty much paid for I'm gonna take advantage. So I went back, picked up. You know, I'm blessed. I've never had a single. And I'd be in the hospital and guys would wake up in and I knew what was going on. They were dreaming. But I've talked to some therapists and what they say is are fortunate where they that they can't pull it back out and they said that might I got out with a disability and I ended up the first that got out of school and I wouldn't have done that. I carried the guilt a long time before I shared it with a I still sleep in a chair; That's where I sleep. I didn't know if I was gonna be able because I let this for 52 weeks in a row. And he knew what he was doing. He's a clinical psychologist. The guy was able to take and play with them. When he put them back, they didn't have as big before I talked to this guy. So the things that bugged for 45 years, they got a. I went back in '99. I was really a little apprehensive because I didn't know what. We were able to get to the June 29th battle site, which is now a rice paddy. Totally cleared, We weren't able to get out to it because the flooding and and we were done humping. We went to visit the 3rd and that's where they brought everybody. Now, it's a North. Upstairs were where the wards were. That's where the museum is now. And I could just feel the and really getting nervous. But we went in there and there and Colonel and just one that were running the museum. And through our interpreters, And it was really interesting hearing their perspective of the war. When we met this guy out there, he had been a VC and he was now. And we talked about the war, battles, and I asked him if he and he kind of looked at me like, "You stupid American." You fought a battle out here. I lived here my whole life. I fought battles out here. He was very nice. He wasn't arrogant. We were able to meet up with at a dinner and talked a lot more. And one of them stated to meet the Americans, And he said something that is that we were just all young men doing what our countries told us to do. And that really rang true. It was a great experience for me because I let a lot of hatred go. That was a very good catharsis. Get rid of those old ghosts. I've been back to Vietnam. And I went back the first time with an objective of trying to find where I'd been hurt and. It was just something in my I was driven and it got in my. And I wanted to go back in 29th of June and in Silver City. Jack Kelley had given me the maps and that's what I had to work with because we didn't have GPS back then and it took me three trips. What we all remember as the jungle and the clay bottoms and all. And then I had an urge to try to get guys involved to do because in the big city they got a lot of opportunities Saigon, But out in the country, And so we got together and that allowed some of these kids during that same wet weather rather than to shut down. And we built a dormitory so that kids that came from a distance because school buses and transportation, they're too poor for that. We were able to build a really that allowed kids from the country, poor kids to come in. Quick aside, you're not allowed to name anything after. But what we did do when was we put Malcolm Berry, and he was actually what I and we put his name on the bridge. And so if you go up the not a plaque because they. We had it engraved in a stone but they put his name on the bridge, and they put it on the side. That's kind of cool. After the war, I was constantly fighting because of all the anti-war protestors and sticking up for my brothers. After a while, I was because they were talking. You just couldn't get away from it so I just finally started and didn't even tell. I went on like that. Then through the association hooking up with the guys again and feeling relaxed and at home and kind of unloading everything that you'd been stuffing for years, it seemed like we had all done that. We used to call them beers and. A lot of bad memories from. But I never got wounded or I really didn't know if I wanted to go and my wife finally convinced me, she said, "Why don't you go? She said, "It could be good for you." And I did. And I got in there and I think it was the and I walked in with my bags and I could hear all. It was very loud in there. When I walked up to check in, "Well, you can't check in right now because the rooms are. She said, "Just leave. We'll get it to your room and come to see me when you're done and we'll give you a key at the desk." And I walked into the bar and and I grabbed it soon going to the bar. And as luck would have it, the guy who was next. And I didn't know him at that point. Well, I did, I knew him over there, but when you don't see somebody. So he was talking, he was drunk. He looked at me and he said, And I told him. He said, "What company were you in?" "A Company." "What battalion?" "2nd Battalion." "Me too." "So What platoon?" I said, "Second." "Ah, I was in first". "So you must know Leo?" "Yeah." He said, Leo "French' Pellerin." So anyway, we hit it off. And a bunch of guys came and I think it was when I left the bar to go upstairs. I had no idea where I. But that was my first reunion and I had so much fun in that I said, "Yep, I got to keep going." So since 1985, I've probably only missed maybe four or five reunions. I met James Miskel for the first time in 50 years last night. So I had a good conversation with him. He told me I was actually that was pulled out just because. I just love these guys. Every one of them. Some of them were, to be polite, jerks, but most of those guys. And you can tell Lieutenant Vose. And like any group of soldiers, you get the disputes and. That stuff went away quick. I think we had great. And the troops would do anything. When they carried me off there. And I remember how they carried me off, I didn't see the picture I had been shot in the right side and there was a big. And I'd been shot in the chest and there was a big. And so when Jack gave me that picture, I went out and had it blown because it was just kind of cool and I wouldn't have that. All these guys the names like Ferguson, or Ron Sedlack. All these names are just stories. And I think about the and I think about the and how things would. I can't imagine. I look at my family and my children, just a stroke of luck I'm here. Oh, I'm just very proud that I was able the most highly decorated combat brigade. I'm proud I got to be a part of that. And the men that were in. I think A Company was unique. I know we had the highest casualty count in the year that I was there, We always did whatever. And I'm very proud of what I did and proud of all my brothers. To the herd. Through this journey, I learned more about my dad although I will never truly be able to understand what he. My father's only sibling died before. But what I discovered through this. After 50 years, Mainly of remembrance. First of all, the guys. Lord help me not forget them. For the guys who were because of that, don't forget them. For kids who will never know. For the heroism that I saw on that day and that I remember, don't forget that. For His word that says, But that a man would lay I saw that. I remember that.
