(mellow trumpet music) Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. (mellow harmonica music) (pleasant orchestral music) (upbeat harmonica music) (car horn honking) (traffic noise) - [Man] Hey, Limpy, come here a minute. - [Woman] Poor old soul. - [Man] Who is she? Does anybody know her? - [Woman] Never seen her before. - I know her. I know who she is. It's old Mrs. Darrell, Starry Darrell of Bane Street. Fetch her into Luigi's. - [Man] Come on, easy, hup. - Can we have a chair, Luigi? - What is the trouble? - Old poppy thrown a fit out on the pavement. In the saloon, not in here. - That's all right. Bring her in. Put her in that chair there, boys. (Starry moaning) We will see to the old lady, thank you. - I'm all right now. - [Luigi] Thank you for your help. - I only wanted a chair, Luigi. I didn't mean to bring her right in. - No, it's all right. Who is she? - Starry, Starry Darrell of Bane Street. She tells fortunes. - Limpy's right. He knows me. I must've fainted. I suppose it's the heat. God, I'm sweatin'. - [Luigi] Give her a cup of tea, Limpy. - You dropped this outside. - Thank you, Limpy, thank you. - Tell me something, Starry. Tell me what's gonna happen to me. - You'll be all right, Limpy. You'll do fine. - [Limpy] What, money, do you mean? - Someone will leave you a fortune, one of these days. - And women? - You'll die for love of 'em, most like. Very kind of you, I'm sure. If either of you ever want a free consultation, you can find your way to Bane Street, can't you? (grunting) - [Limpy] Can't help fix the chair, girl. - Bane Street, you won't forget, will you? (door clicking) - Hey, Nikki, come away from that door. Beat it. Hey, Nikki. (picture frame clattering) - It's all right, Limpy, it's all right. There's a cop outside, and I can't take any chances. (metal reverberating) Good stuff, this. - I said outside. Blow. It's a blueser, the cop. - Take a seat, Fred. - They ain't the sort of prizes we give away, Luigi. He's wasting your time. (briefcase lid clunking) - Take it away. No moral sense, these fellows. They would sell anybody anything. - Nah, I don't like the look on his face, Luigi. You know, if I was in your shoes, I wouldn't look twice at the stuff. - What is it you've come to see me about? - Well, a robbery near here last night, in fact, a series of robberies. A tough, well-organized gang. We think some of the boys are using your saloon. So, we'd like you to keep your eyes open. - Listen, Fred, if I wanted to be a policeman, I would've joined the force, but if I knew how or where a robbery was committed, and you asked for such information, I would not withhold it. - Fair enough, Luigi. Fair enough. Good day, Luigi. - [Luigi] So long, Fred. - That was neat, Luigi, neat as they come. - The next time you see Nikki, tell him if he ever comes near this place again, I'll break his neck. - That old blighter nipped in here before I could. - Where did this come from? - It was in Nikki's bag. He got rid of it. Hold on, Luigi. I'd rather keep that, if you don't mind. - All right, Limpy. A very beautiful girl. Yes, you keep it, Limpy, eh? (sultry harmonica and bass music) (car engine humming) (car door banging) (doorbell buzzing) - Inspector Johnstone? - Yes. - Didn't you chaps get all the information you wanted this morning, or do you have to have it in triplicate or some fool thing like that? - I'm sorry to disturb you again, Captain Gale, but several flats in this block have been burgled, and we suspect the work of a specialized gang. I'd like to get the details myself. - I don't know what you mean by details. We were asleep last night. - We, sir? That's? - Myself and my wife. - Does anyone else sleep here? - A maid down the corridor. - I see. Well, perhaps I could have a look around. - Let you nose around the whole place now if you like. You'll probably find my wife in the bath or dressing. - Well, I have no wish to disturb Mrs. Gale. - Have you come about the robbery? - Yes. - Well, here's a complete list of everything that was taken. - My wife's going out for the evening so you'd better question her pretty quickly. I'm not included in the party. I'm just the husband. - You were both sleeping and heard nothing. - Well, my husband telephoned the police this morning as soon as we knew. (people laughing and chattering) - Gerald, I don't think you've met Rose. - Good evening. - Well, I think I'll be going. - Well, not until I know who you are. I sense mysteries and strategums. - I'm awfully sorry. I didn't quite catch your name. - Johnstone with a T. - With a T? Where's the body, Inspector? - No body, only a robbery. - Last night? - Nigel? Staying long? Nigel Lee, the whole affair's in the hands of the police, and if I have to tell anybody else, I shall go mad. - My dear Scotland Yarder, you wouldn't dream of going without a drink. You know, robberies are just off my street. - I'm sure Mrs. Gale will give you the facts. I'll see myself out. (people chattering) (mellow music) - Why on earth didn't you tell the inspector you weren't here last night, that I was alone in the flat? - What the devil does it go to do with him where I was last night? - Lying to me is one thing. I'm used to it, but, Gerald, in a case like this it's different. - Last night's my business. What are you worrying about? They'll catch the thief anyway. Well, you know who's coming. If you are going out, I'm expecting them any minute. (guests laughing and chattering) - Cheer up, Barbara. Tonight we'll take our fun just where we find it. I know a little restaurant back of Soho. (chuckling) I'll phone. (upbeat orchestral music) (people chattering) (upbeat jazz music) (cork popping) (people chattering) (upbeat big band music) (people laughing and chattering) - Luigi, can you come back to the saloon right away? - It's all right, come on in, Limpy. What's the matter? What's happened? - Well, I'd rather you come back and see for yourself. - Well, I was coming anyway. - I'm going home. Let me alone. Get your hands off. - You'll do as I tell ya. - Gary, don't. - Go on home. - I'll take her home, when I'm good and ready. - [Limpy] Leave him alone, Luigi. Come on back to the saloon. (glass clattering) (punch smacking) (punch smacking) - [Luigi] I said, go home. (heels clicking) (traffic noise) (upbeat big band music) (people chattering) - [Man] Come on up, see. Number, number, number 10 from the start. - Here, Limpy. Change, Limpy. - And you, sir, come on over here. Number, number nine, special number nine. 45, number 45. Number 16 and the next one. Don't be fooled gently, ladies and gentlemen, or you'll never get on to summer. 99, come as a shock, and the next one. Number 57, a five and a seven together. Now, come one, come on. And number. (fist pounding) - Hey, you, Limpy. - Who said you could call me Limpy? - [Nigel] Isn't that what she called ya? The girl? - Yes. - Well, Limpy, old son, this machine's a fraud. - No scenes, Nigel, please. - It's a bent penny. Some people are mean. They hang on to 'em for so long they get bent. There you are, your lordship, with the proprietor's compliments. (playful music) - This little fellow knows a thing or two. - Nigel? Give me some pennies, Nigel. - [Nigel] Ask hop-a-long. He's the man you want. - Clubfoot, lucky. - [Nigel] Let go of her, you crazy cripple. - No quarrels. No fights. Young lady, you apologize to Limpy here. - I'm sorry. - Luigi. (people laughing and chattering) Passed out cold. Been givin' me a pound note for every round and refuses any change. - [Luigi] How long has he been playing? - Half an hour. - Feelin' anything tonight, dear? - Grow a few inches, and I'll tell ya. (cash register dinging) - Give us me things, girl. - What's the trouble, Limpy? - Nothing we can't handle. - Oh. - Hello? This is Luigi. Send a cab over right away to pick up a drunk, will you? - [Cab Company] Where to Luigi? - Ah. He will have an escort, a lady. She will tell you where. - [Cab Company] Righto. (phone clattering) - It's his lordship again. It's all right. He's as quiet as a mouse now. Says I'm the best friend he ever had. He wants to borrow the Konki machine for a party at the weekend. Nutty as a fruitcake if you ask me. - All right, tell him yes. Anything to keep him quiet. I'll be in presently. (knocking) This way please. If you will open the door, I'll take him to the cab. - He's a, he's nice to thank you, ain't he, Miss? (laughing) Happy enough though. Here, let me have him. We'll have him home and dry in no time. After you, Miss. (gentle harmonica music) (car door banging) (car engine starting) (people chattering) (upbeat big band music) - Had to turn up for the big moment, Luigi? I could've dropped when I saw her and her crowd come in. It's Gala night. Little Boy Blue's outside. Wants a word with ya. - Oh, can I have a word with you in private, Luigi? - With all this noise going on, this is about as private as you'll find anywhere. - Well, according to information we received, there was an assault in the street outside the Marcus of Granby earlier tonight. - That is right. You can call it an assault. - You wouldn't like to say why you did it? - Well, a girl was being manhandled. When I interfered, the man threatened me and threw the beer in my face. There was a fight. - What happened then? - Ah, the woman ran off. - Well, the man's name is West. He was taken to hospital. Gashed his head on the pavement. They had to put stitches in him. - Oh. - We've got a man over there taking his statement, but this man won't prosecute. - The station sergeant sent me over to have the matter out with you and to warn you, Luigi. The police won't do anything this time, but, remember, we're likely to take an interest in people who go 'round, well, knocking other people down. - Look, I don't want any trouble with the law. I have my license for running this place to think about. If he had not been a hooligan, I would not have hit him. - Who was the girl, the one who ran away? - I, I don't know. - I'll slough off then, Luigi, but take my advice and stay out of trouble. And then, we shan't come worrying you again. Good night. - Well, I'll come with you. I need the fresh air. (clock chiming) (man announcing) (horse hooves clomping) (mellow harmonica music) (water splashing) (pail clanking) - [Angele] Limpy? - Angele, girl, what in heaven's name are you doin' here? - Is Luigi inside? - Now you know how he'd crank, even if I let you near the place. After last night and all? Besides, he ain't here. - I thought we were friends. - All right. Don't look surprised. I told you he wasn't here. I've got a couple hours off this evening. I'd like to see a movie. If you was to come with me, just for the company I mean, we could come back here afterwards, and I could fix it up for you to see Luigi. - That too would be nice, Limpy. - And you wouldn't tell him about comin' here? About me bringin' you in? - I told you, we're friends. - Good then. (car engine rumbling) (car door banging) (dog barking) (doorbell ringing) - [Barbara] Oh, come in. - Where do you want the machine? - Oh, over there will do, Mr. Luigi. Here. (dog barking) - I thought this was your friend's idea. - It was. - But you wrote this? - Yes. - Then, you are Barbara Gale. - That's right. - It's a small world, isn't it? - I guessed you were Luigi. So, I sent the postcard on impulse. - Looking at the picture of a beautiful girl one day, and then meeting up with the real thing the next. I'm talking about your picture, the one that was stolen. - Isn't that a dangerous thing to say? - Well, the police suspected a man who frequents my saloon. He did try to hide in there, but I sent him away. Now that I know the details, I'll be glad to help in any way. - The police caught up with the man this morning. - Well, I said it's a very small world, didn't I? (phone ringing) - [Gerald] Is that you, Barbara? - Yes, Gerald. - There's an extra couple joining us, Harris and the girl. Can't make it today. You'd better count on us arriving tomorrow morning. - Oh, you're coming down tomorrow? - Bye. (dog barking) (laughing) - Now I am acting on impulse. Will you have dinner with me tonight? I heard they won't be here 'til tomorrow. - Well, there's a lot to do. There's quite a crowd coming. - If you have any cakes to bake, I'm a very good cook, Mrs. Gale, and I promise to get you back in time. - All right. It's a promise. (timer ringing) (dish banging) Mmm, smells good. - I told you I was a good cook. - Is this your father? - [Luigi] How did you guess? - There is a likeness. - What was he? - They called him the professor and his marionettes. They traveled half the globe in his time and dragged me right along with him. - And then? - He died. And I lost the best friend a man ever had. A good cook hates to see his food grow cold. - [Barbara] Tell me some more. - Well, he taught me a great deal, above all to appreciate the value of good things. - I see. - [Luigi] That might sound odd coming from the proprietor of a pin-table saloon. - It's your life. - No, my father had very little when he died. I had neither his skill nor his talent. All I knew was show business. I started as a boxer, and now I own a pin-table saloon. But it's been the means to an end. I've made money. And the end is nearly in sight, Barbara. (gentle jazz music) - [Theater Attendant] Upstairs please. Through there. - [Limpy] Two Circles please. - Luigi. I have to go. - Barbara. (screen whirling) (big band music) (people chattering) (laughing) It's all right. He cannot see us. There's a mirror on the other side. Help yourself to some coffee. I'll only be a minute. - [Barbara] Well, if you're going to leave me alone, at least let me amuse myself. (screen whirling) (upbeat big band music) (screen whirling) - Why do you come here? What do you want? - Why do you think I've come? I just wanted to thank you for what you did for me last night. - Then, repay me by staying away. - I've kept away, haven't I? Like I promised. - And that is the way I want it. Do you understand? That is the way I want it. - You're flogging a dead horse, chum. Half the program's over, and the main feature's been on for 20 minutes or more. (mellow harmonica music) (upbeat big band music) (people chattering) - Break it up. No, no, no, no, no, it's all right. It's all right. (sailor puppet laughing) - Who was the girl? - The girl? - Any complications? - None. (gentle orchestral music) Good night. (car engine starting) (playful music) (phone ringing) - Hello? (voice murmuring) Speak up. I can't hear you. - [Woman] I said are you the William Maternity Home? - This is Luigi's. - Aren't you Liberty 4-2-9-1. - Wrong number. (phone clattering) (clock ticking) (upbeat trumpet music) (upbeat big band music) - (laughing) Why, Limpy, you're all dressed up like a done dinner. Dance with me, Limpy. (laughing) (glass breaking) (record scratching) I'm drunk, Limpy, and I'm sorry. Coffee, that's what I need, plenty of black coffee, Limpy. Then, you shall take me home. You've never taken a girl home before, have you, Limpy? (suspenseful orchestral music) Give me my key, Limpy. - Yes. - Shhh. (door banging) (knocking) (footsteps echoing) (suspenseful orchestral music) (glass crashing) (car engine humming) (car door banging) (men chattering) (women laughing) [Gerald] Hello, who are you? - My name is Luigi. I've come to pick up the machine. Is Mrs. Gale at home? - She's gone to the village. Be back in about an hour. Run short a fool, it seems. - [Man] Waiting for you, Nigel. - Sorry, not for me. Going for a dip. - Bring Mr. Luigi a drink. Perhaps he might like to join us since you're not playing. - The stakes are pretty high, Luigi. We don't play with pennies here. (cards fluttering) - I think I have had enough. - [Man] The game's hardly started. - You were warned the stakes were high. You could've backed out then. - I'm well aware of that, Mr. Gale. I'm not concerned over the stakes. - What's the matter? - Nothin'. Perhaps one of you gentlemen would like to make a side bet. You for instance. - Meaning? - 500 pounds that hand wins this round. I'll double it. I'll make it a thousand pounds, and that there's no gamble or chance. It is a certainty. (door clicking) May I give you a hand, Mrs. Gale? (door banging) - Luigi, I'm sorry that this has happened to you. - I'll come straight to the point. Why do you put up with all this? That's their life, not yours. - It's been my life for the last two years. - Your husband is just a pawn in the game. - That's worse, isn't it? - Barbara, in a short time I've become very sure of one thing, that I love you very much. I said I would come straight to the point, didn't I? Make a fresh start with me. Perhaps anything I say does not alter things. - You said the one thing I wanted you to say. I'll come Luigi. I'll come whatever happens. Now, please go. - Take my key, in case you should need it. (door banging) - In future, I'll choose every guest who comes into this house. What did he want anyway? - You invited him to play. I think he has the right to ask the questions, not you. - Get in that room. They're your guests as well as mine. - Not anymore. - Go on. - I'm through with your shady friends, your pickup girls, and with you. (door slamming) - [Man] Are you and Barbara quarreling? - She's gone. She'll call up in a week. It's happened before. (cards snapping) (car engine humming) (car door banging) (car door banging) - Jeff, I had a flat. Fix it for me, will ya? - Okay, Luigi. - [Luigi] Oh, may I use your phone? - Sure. (door banging) (phone ringing) (shoes clicking) (phone ringing) (somber music) (suspenseful music) (somber music) (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music) (water gurgling) (suspenseful music) (phone jingling) (phone ringing) - Hello? - This is Luigi. - Who? - [Luigi] Is Limpy there? - Limpy? Gone to bed hours ago. - Hey, aye, Chinner. Hello? - [Luigi] This is Luigi. - Luigi, yes? - Listen carefully. Fetch my car and bring it to the saloon. Can you do that, Limpy? - I'll have a try. - [Luigi] Right away. - Any trouble, Luigi? - No questions, Limpy. Just bring it. (car engine humming) (tires squealing) Are you there, Limpy? - Yes. - Never mind the saloon. Try the corner of Packer Street and hurry. (phone clattering) (car engine humming) (tires squealing) (tires squealing) (car door banging) - Hello, Hadley, what's it all about? - Go on, Roberts. - [Fred] Well, I was doin' my usual round, sir, and I found the door open. Then, I came in. Then, I telephoned the station. - Well, take your time and give me the details, especially the unimportant ones. - There was a knife on the floor, sir, and somebody's taken the trouble to wash the bloodstain off the carpet. They've forgotten about the knife. Underneath this chair here there's a trace of powder. Face powder I should say it was, sir, 'cause when I came in here I, well, noticed a strong smell of perfume. I examined the kitchen, sir, and I found a cloth that'd been wrung out to dry. And like I said I telephoned the sergeant. I know a good deal about this place, sir. - Bad? - [Fred] Well, no, sir. - Any conclusions? - Well, it's hardly for me to say, sir. Be pure guesswork, incomplete so to speak. - Roberts, by the look of things, a woman has been assaulted or killed in this room. You've given me the factual details. If you know anything else, for heaven's sake. Yes, Hadley? - We just picked up two men and the body of girl, sir. - [Inspector Johnstone] Where? - On the Great West Road. - [Inspector Johnstone] The girl? - They haven't touched the body yet, sir. - [Inspector Johnstone] Her name? - Angel, Angele Abbe, sir. - Angele Abbe. This is too easy. Who are the men? - One of them's called Luigi, sir. The other's a little fellow called Limpy. - I know the girl, sir. Luigi was mixed up in a brawl with a seamen. It was over this girl. It wasn't exactly Luigi's fault, but when I questioned him he said he didn't know her. - [Inspector Johnstone] Good. Bring in the little fella first. - Yes, sir. - Do you realize you're in a hell of mess? - Yes, governor, but there ain't much I could say as help you or anybody else. - Except that you're an accessory after the fact. Unless, of course, you killed the girl. - Oh, no. I was told to bring Luigi's car around to the saloon. That is, Packer Street. If that's your tack, Inspector, I'll be glad to answer any questions. - Sit down. - I prefer to stand. - [Inspector Johnstone] Why did you dispose of the body? Why didn't you report it? - All I know is what I have already told the sergeant here. I was out this afternoon and evening visiting friends. I did not get home 'til late, and I found the girl dead in my room. - Did you know here? - Hardly. - That's a lie. Remember, we're holding you as suspects. - That's his pride, that's all. Went steady with her for a year or more. Then, found out a lot of other guys were going with her, not so steady, sailor boy, for one. - There's some truth in that, sir. I think he took it pretty hard. Well, I did say I knew a lot about this place, sir. - [Inspector Johnstone] Remember the girl is dead, Roberts. - You said I was suspect. I'm sorry not to be of more help, but I have told you the truth. - [Inspector Johnstone] Is it true Limpy knew nothing about it? - I phoned him to bring over my car. That's all he knew. - All right, Limpy, you may go. - What'll I do now? - Carry on with your work as usual. - You're a cool customer, Luigi, but you're in a bad spot. (Limpy thumping) (footsteps echoing) - Limpy, where are you? - [Limpy] Where do you think? I'm down here, gettin' up. - These shutters are locked on the inside, sir. He must be in the saloon somewhere. - Is there any other way out of the saloon? - [Fred] There's only a store cupboard here, sir. - Only a cupboard, you say. - [Fred] That's right, sir. - Limpy? Is that right? - That's right, Inspector. Only there's another little door stuck on the other end of it. - Well, where does that lead to? - Knowing Luigi, I'd say halfway across London. - [Newsie] Papers, New Star Standard. Papers up, read all about it. Papers, New Star Standard. Papers. (gentle acoustic guitar music) - Which one of you is Starry Darrell's brother? - It's Luigi. You know Luigi's Pin-Table Saloon. Says he wants Starry's brother. - [Starry's Brother] Okay, come and sit down. - He's deaf. Wants you to sit close, but don't shout at him. - My name's Darrell. - I've just come from Starry's place on Bane Street. She sent me to you. (gentle acoustic guitar music) A girl was murdered in my saloon last night. - What is it you want? - A place to stay until I can talk to a friend of mine who was seen running away from the saloon that night. - You told Starry everything? - Yes, yes, everything. Now, could you find someone to get in touch with Limpy and send him to me? He works at my place. - Stay here for the next few days. After that, you must leave. Murder's a serious business. - I understand. (door banging) (knocking) (clock ticking) (bell ringing) (knocking) - This is Inspector Johnstone, Mrs. Toms. - Pleased to meet you, I'm sure. I got her things. It ain't much. They're in here. - Take a seat, Mrs. Toms. Mrs. Toms, were there any callers, in the last few days I mean? - That's hard to say. I'm out a good deal. She had callers, but I saw very little of them. - Any telephone? - We ain't got a telephone. - I see someone has broken the glass in your front door. - Yes. Pity the police weren't around at the time. - Why, did someone do it deliberately then? - Don't ask me. Such a thing's never happened before, not all the years I've been keepin' house. - When did it happen? - Just about one o'clock in the mornin' on Friday night. - And how can you be so sure of the time? - I'd had a bad night, and it was just about one o'clock when I heard a cab drive away. Then I heard the front door slam and somebody runnin' up the stairs. And after that I heard the crash of broken glass. (briefcase locks clicking) - Could it have been Miss Abbe running up the stairs? - It was Miss Abbe. Someone threw her handbag through the glass into the hall. She must've quarreled outside with someone. And then, she's dead and gone, poor dear. Ain't no sense in talkin' about it now. - Quite, Mrs. Toms. Now there's just one more question. You wouldn't know which handbag it was, would you? - (gasping) Oh, it was her evening bag. I picked it up the next mornin', but I forgot to give it to her. - Thank you, Mrs. Toms. Now we won't trouble you anymore. Are these men taking this machine away, Limpy? - [Limpy] That's right, Inspector. - I said nothing was to be touched in this place. - Luigi never liked the thing, and we needed the space anyway. - Okay. - Can you spare a minute, Limpy? - Well, business ain't exactly brisk. - Sit down, Limpy. When was the jukebox smashed? - Friday night, just as we were closing. - How well did you know Angele Abbe? - Angele? Apart from her morals, she was a good soul and always had a kind word for me. - And when did you last see her? - Friday night, in the saloon was the last time I saw her. She'd had a few, I can tell ya. - Did Luigi see her that night too? - That I couldn't tell ya. - Have you read these? - [Limpy] Uh huh. - According to a statement you made, you saw the girl and the sailor on Saturday morning. Why didn't you tell us? - Oh, the sailor boy, yeah, that's right. Well, that's a good job of keepin' my eyes open for ya, aint' it? - Was he anywhere near the saloon? - Could've been. Yeah, that's right, he was. Come to think of it, he had it in for both of 'em, Angele and Luigi. - All right, Limpy, you can go. (traffic noise) (bell ringing) (door clicking) - Hiya. I've come to see a friend who's stayin' here. - No mistaking you. You must be Limpy. - No cracks from you, Granddad. - Upstairs. (clock ticking) (water gurgling) (knocking) - Come. Oh, come in, Limpy. - That was a neat getaway, Luigi. Clean as a whistle. They're scratchin' their heads at the Yard, and it ain't because they're itchin'. - Sit down, Limpy. There's little time left for what I want you to do. You know who I mean by Mrs. Gale? - [Limpy] Yes. - Give her this glove. Then, bring her back here to me right away. If there's any trouble, go to Starry. She'll know how. - [Limpy] What do you want Mrs. Gale for? - She ran out of my apartment the night Angele was killed. She dropped her glove. - [Limpy] Nah, you're mistaken. Weren't you down at the cottage? - No small talk, Limpy. Here, take the glove. I slipped the address inside. Now, let me see how quick you can move. I've got to talk to her right away. (traffic noise) (knocking) - [Starry] Who is it? - Hello, Starry. What do you think of things? - Bad, Limpy, bad. - They ain't as bad as you think. I've come for the free consultation, remember? - What, at a time like this? - Yeah. I'm gonna rise in the world, Starry. Me, Limpy. Only I'm a bit impatient. I wanna know a few things. - How about Luigi? - He's fine. He was smart comin' to you. At least he could tell what time of the day it is. That's more than the police can. Fingerprints, pretty pictures. That don't tell 'em anything. They think Luigi done it for sure. Next thing you'll read, they'll be pickin' up a sailor boy, but you know, Starry, there's one other person they aint' thought of. I'm investigatin' that little matter meself. Now, I'm gonna hold you to your promise. Come on, Starry, and make sure it's nothing bad. (cards tapping) (phone ringing) (phone ringing) - Hello? - [Inspector Johnstone] Is that you, Limpy? - Speaking. - [Inspector Johnstone] This is Inspector Johnstone. - Oh, I recognized your voice. - Tell me something. Do you know any other woman that visited Luigi in the last few days? - Ah, not offhand I don't, but I'll think about it. - [Inspector Johnstone] Right. - I'll tell you what though. There has been a woman who rung up the saloon a couple of times. And when she couldn't speak to Luigi she wouldn't leave her name. - We know that. She made the calls from separate booths. We haven't been quick enough to trace her. - [Limpy] Oh, I see. - I'd like to send one of my men down to Luigi's. Will you be there to show him around? - Ah, well, what time, Inspector? - Well, I'm afraid he's out on a job now. It wouldn't be until late tonight. - [Limpy] Mmm, suits me, Inspector. - Would 11:30 tonight be too late? - Well, no, all right, I've still got some tidying up to do. - [Inspector Johnstone] All right, thank you, Limpy. - Any news of the sailor boy, Inspector? - We've got him here now. Goodbye, Limpy. - Ditto. (phone bell dinging) - You are running away from a killing, ain't it? - Just running, Pappa. - In one paper they say it's you, Luigi. In another, it's a seaman they want. In tonight's, they mention a woman is the case. You couldn't have all done it. Could you? - Show me the paper, Pappa. - It's downstairs. I get it. Limpy ain't there, son. He's been home all day, but you have just missed him. (suspenseful music) - [Luigi] Hey. (car horns honking) (car engine humming) (car door banging) (footsteps echoing) (dramatic orchestral music) (suspenseful music) - It's all right. I let meself in through the service door. It wasn't so difficult. And don't look so frightened, Mrs. Gale. A little cooperation, that's all that's necessary. I'm sure you and I are gonna understand one another. This is your glove, isn't it? - Yes. - That's right. It was picked up at Luigi's after the girl was killed. If the police knew this, Mrs. Gale, they'd pull you in as a very strong suspect. First, you'd have to explain why you came to Luigi's, not that they'd believe you. And that would lead to more trouble. You see, they picked up a sailor boy now. He's already had a fight over the girl, and he was seen with her on Saturday morning. But this glove, that's different. It's evidence. You'd have a hard time gettin' out of it. (phone ringing) Don't do that, Mrs. Gale. That's right. I'm glad you didn't make me use force. See, when you're a cripple, you have to drag yourself about for years by your arms. It makes you strong. (phone ringing) - [Inspector Johnstone] Hello, this is Inspector Johnstone. - Inspect, Inspector Johnstone. - [Inspector Johnstone] Mrs. Gale? - Yes, this is Mrs. Gale. - [Inspector Johnstone] We're sending a car for you. It's on its way. - Car on its way. - [Inspector Johnstone] Yes. - Yes, I'll be ready. - [Inspector Johnstone] Right, goodbye. - Goodbye. - That's all right, Mrs. Gale. He wants to ask you a few questions about Luigi comin' down to the cottage with the machine. What time he left and a few questions like that. They've got nothing on you. There's nothing worse than a woman being held up on a murder charge. I'll be seein' you, Mrs. Gale. (car engine humming) - Please sit down. Events move quickly, don't they, Mrs. Gale? One day we're discussing stolen silver and another murder. We have a close check on all your movements since the first night you visited Luigi's saloon. In fact, I was at the cottage yesterday. Now then, you came to London by train, went straight to your flat, 20 minutes later went out again. Since then, we have no check. Where were you, Mrs. Gale? (knocking) - Luigi's here, sir. - Good. You're not exactly strangers, you know. Isn't that why you're here, Luigi? To protect Mrs. Gale? - Leave her alone, Johnstone. You don't scare anybody. - Mrs. Gale doesn't give that impression. For that matter, neither do you. - Let her go, and I. - Sit down. People make a fool of me once in a while. I booked you both in. We're gonna thrash out every detail, and my time is valuable. Now listen, this is important to both of you. Answer these questions carefully and truthfully. (clock ticking) (phone ringing) - [Inspector Johnstone] Is that you, Limpy? This is Inspector Johnstone. - Yes, Inspector. - [Inspector Johnstone] I'm sorry, Limpy. My man can't make it tonight after all. Sorry, it's so late. What time is it? - It's exactly 12, Inspector. - [Inspector Johnstone] Thank you. Are you all right, Limpy? - Of course I'm all right. What do you mean? - [Inspector Johnstone] Oh, nothing, nothing, Limpy. One thing before you go. (bell tinkling) Yes, Limpy. - What was it you wanted? (coin clicking) (upbeat trumpet music) (upbeat big band music) No. No. No. I killed her. (record skipping) Angele. (somber music) Mister Copper. - All right, Limpy, you come along with us. - I don't wanna go the Yard. - [Luigi] What happened, Limpy? - She was here Friday night. Wanted you. She let me take her home. Then, tricked me. I waited in the street for her on Saturday. Told her it was all right. You would see her. When she came, I showed her into your room. Left her alone for a bit. I was the piper. I called the tune. - Go on. - Afterwards, she started cryin', never stoppin'. Nearly drove me out of me mind. I picked up the knife off the desk. I told her if she didn't shut up, I'd. - The cab driver told us you called with Angele Abbe. That and the broken panel in the glass door was all we had to go on. And finally, your visit to Mrs. Gale. - No more details. I'll talk to the press boys. - What's the difference? - I'll tell you the difference. Read that. - Mr. Danny Thomas, employee at Luigi's Pin-Table Saloon. - Begin again. Read it loud. - Mr. Danny Thomas. - That's it. Mr. Danny Thomas to you, copper. (record skipping) Don't let them take me, Luigi. - All right, Luigi, leave him to me. On your way out, tell Sergeant Hadley I want him.
