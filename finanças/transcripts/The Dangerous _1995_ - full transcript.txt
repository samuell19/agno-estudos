You got a wild way of asking for a date, gorgeous. [MUSIC PLAYING] [EXOTIC MUSIC PLAYING] You can have him, now. [CHUCKLING] I guess you didn't break any laws when you let Tito's boys have a go at me. This is New Orleans, Davalos. We make our own laws here. You know why? 'Cuz we always have. I'll give you the keys, and a walk from the 100 years you're going to serve for putting six people in the morgue, if you do a favor for me. You want me to do it, it can't be a favor. Has to be a nightmare. [CHUCKLING] Two days ago, a couple of Tito Valejo's boys were cut up on 11. Yesterday, Pablo and Cesar Valejo were cut down. All four were killed with Japanese swords and daggers. Anybody see anything? Both occasions, they killed the dealers, left the mules alive. You might know what we would find. I bet you've got the keys. [CHUCKLING] [METAL CLINKING] [CHUCKLING] I'll run you with a young cop. It it is Japanese, you'll know more than anybody. All I want from you is your word. What makes you think I just won't run? You get back for something besides your friend March. Take this. I'll call you, put you with my man. You know, Polk, some law has never been written down, more important than any laws in the world. [CHUCKLES] I pitty you for believing that, Davalos. I really do.

What the hell do you want, Stankowski. You're making me look bad in front of Tito. You don't need my help to look bad. [CLICKING] Look. I've got a good thing going here. You know what I mean. Tito made you my responsibility. So you've got to behave. Is that a threat, fat boy? Look, we're both going to end up answering to Tito if you don't straighten up. He doesn't like it when you disrespect-- Well, you can tell Tito he can kiss my-- [SLAPPING] I'd like you to leave now. [MUSIC PLAYING] Slapping me around's not going to make Tito very happy. [LAUGHING] I just did you a favor, sugar. Tito told me to do a lot worse than that. So you do me a favor-- behave. [KEYS JINGLE] [INAUDIBLE] [GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING] I ought to kill you for walking out on me. Would you like to hear my side of the story? And what can that be? First you tell me you love me, then you disappear. Then you show up like some knight in shining armor. The only thing I see is a heartless tin man. And all I see is someone who should get away from Tito before she gets hurt. At least he's dependable. Oh, yeah. As dependable as a bullet in your heart. That's deep, Billy. Then again, you haven't been much on communicating, have you? [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUFFLED VOICES FROM OUTSIDE] Looks like one of us has drawn some attention. You'd better go, Billy.

Captain, there was no way out of there. I've got Tito Valejo out here. After that, you can take her home. [PHONE RINGING] Tito. Great. [PHONE RINGING IN DISTANCE] We're not happy about your nephews, Tito. A couple of days ago, a couple of white boys that I know, they get cut up like a bucket of pigs. [PHONE RINGING] You guys killed Cesar and Pablo, carved them like Thanksgiving turkey. You know, I can't say we didn't want to, but we never crossed that line, Tito. You guys are crazy. I got a call in to my dog in Congress. Well, he does have a lot of dogs. Now we talk. My lawyers got me kicked. I can go any time. Wherever you go, Tito, you watch what you do. [LAUGHING] Doesn't change the color of money. We'll see you, Tito. [CHUCKLING] You guys don't get who I am, do you? [SNICKERING] Last year, my mom kissed the pope hand in private. Now, that takes a mountain of money. Yeah, well, it's a funny thing about mountains, Tito. You fall off of one, you may never get up. [LAUGHING] I hate to tell you what your mother could kiss of mine. [SMACKS] He's dreaming, Random. Yeah, the problem with that cocksucker is he just made all the dreams come true. Take the mule home. I'll have your new man Davalos meet you over there. Who's Davalos? Don't worry. When you meet him, you'll hate him. Hey, you think she'd let me take a shower? You're the best I got, because you always get what you want. [MUSIC PLAYING] (SINGING) Thunder under the covers. [GROANING] i want to be your stereo lover. So much thunder under the covers.

[PHONE RINGING] Whoa! Who the hell are you? Who is he? Polk, this is Davalos. I just meant Random. In fact, I'm seeing him in action. He wants us to meet him at the airport. He's got a rabbit trying to find a hole. Do you know this guy? How long have you been here? I stopped in the kitchen, had a diet coke, and made it in time for your grand finale. Get dressed. We've got a meeting at the airport. [THUDDING] That's my new partner. They told me I'd hate him. [GROANING] Um, can I borrow your shirt? Sure, take it. Thank you. [OPERA MUSIC PLAYING] Tito. It OK to bring in those men you wanted to do? Just one moment. [OPERA MUSIC PLAYING] Sven. I want you, when I say the word king, to take your gun out, and put it to one of their heads and-- [BLOWS] blow it off. [OPERA MUSIC PLAYING] Tito, these, uh-- these are the specialists you wanted to meet. My name is Emile Lautrek. This is my good friend and my cousin, Henry Lautrek. My cousins get killed by cops. Then they deny it. We understand. I don't hire reputations, nor pretty weapons. Quite understandable. Can I speak to you in a whisper? Certainly. Sometimes we kill people In ordinary ways. But sometimes we're more skilled and like a king. [CRACKING] [SWISHING] [OPERA MUSIC PLAYING] [SLICING] How did you know? He had to wet his lips. They went dry when you said the word "king." I'm sure this was the demonstration that you wanted. TITO: I couldn't tell you. EMILE: He's in terrible pain. Sweet. [SLICING] Now you understand these cops, not like this. I want them cut to pieces. They got four of mine. I want four. Eddie will give you your money. Thanks for making the journey to see me. His gun. Do you want it? Keep it. It's clean. We've never touched guns. We've never had to. [MUSIC PLAYING] MAN: Move, and you're dead. Charming. [AIRPLANE ROARING] We found her an hour ago. She won't talk to anyone, and she won't leave. This man's the distance. Have a bullet ready. Last year, my first daughter came to New Orleans to do research on the trading of cocaine. Six weeks later, she died. One month ago, we found out she had been murdered. My son Kon, and my other daughter, Akiko left me. They have come to New Orleans. DAVALOS: How do you know that? My son left the note. It said, "Mother, when you see me again, I pray that I am dead." It's the vow of the divine wind as they went into battle. They are killing cocaine dealers, and will continue until they are killed themselves. Why are you telling us this, when you know we might have to kill them to stop them? They have already killed four dealers. I want you to stop them before they kill an innocent person. POLK: What will that do for them? It will allow their souls, when they die, to go to heaven. [MUSIC PLAYING] MAN: You mule drugs for Tito Valejo all over the planet? You mean to tell me you don't drink? [CHUCKLES] Now drink. Good girl. [CLICKING] I'll see you later, Vic. See you, brother. We used to shoot Tito's mules after about nine months. But, uh, personally, I feel that pretty girls look so bad with bullets in them. But don't worry, sweetheart. You're not going to feel a thing.

I love Eddie, but I never know where he is. I mean, I'm not the type of guy that gets invited to other people's places, you understand? I'm just a crummy projectionist, you know? DAVALOS: It's getting very hot in here. You want to a soda? [INAUDIBLE] That's very kind of you. Suppose you put some ice in it, because I hear you got a lot of ice. Got stuff in town, I hear. RANDOM: You see this, Lips? This is a drug charge. You go away for life with this. Oh, Fellas, what it is, I mean, I just couldn't-- I couldn't resist it. Get rid of it, Random. Get rid of it before he turns into a madman. [SIGHS] I'm just the shavings off the block, guys. Stankowki's block? He owns a piece of a place, OK. A place where he stays and where he takes care of his industry. And Eddie's got a vision! DAVALOS: Is that so? Yeah, he's going to be the curator of the pornographic history. Yeah, he's making some history himself at it. So he's was making movies again? I don't hurt nobody. I don't hurt nobody. DAVALOS: No, it doesn't hurt anybody. Just every kid that uses.

Only the good die young. I wish I could believe that. [MUSIC PLAYING] [ENGINE STARTING] I got to take you with. What do you mean bring me in? What are you crazy? Maybe. But this time I'm not running away. I'm ready to die. I'm a cop. I can't go with you. OK. And what do I get if I go with you? Nothing. I lose everything. Yeah. If I go with you, will you come back then? If I live. We kill them, or no one does. They belong to us. [ENGINE STARTING] We belong to them. [STREETCAR RUMBLING] Call Flea, get him working for us. Good idea. You know know with Flea. [DIALING] [PHONE RINGING] [BEEPING] Flea here. Flea, Random. We want you to find the Sekis for us. Think you can do it? Random, you're talking to Flea, the greatest vulture in New Orleans. I have them. Are you sure you have them? FLEA: Sure I'm sure. I'm a professional at this. Well, whatever you do, don't lose them, Flea. I can't lose them. RANDOM (ON PHONE): Why not? I'm in their trunk. You're on the phone. How can you be in the trunk? FLEA (ON PHONE): Modern technology. Do you know where you're headed? FLEA (ON PHONE): Yeah, highway 170 north. How can you know that, if you're in his trunk? I have this avuncular ability to determine direction, like a bat. Maybe I should call myself Bat instead of Flea. Listen, Flea, when you get where you're going, you call us back, you got that? FLEA (ON PHONE): 10-4. You sure about this? RANDOM: No, you're sure. Just hit the 170. If he has them, we have them. [FOOTSTEPS CLICKING] You wanted a monitor on the mobile of our outlaws? Yeah. They're on the trail, 170 north. Scramble the northern precinct SWAT team. But what if we leave our jurisdiction? There is no jurisdiction on this, just dead perps. [MUSIC PLAYING] [GRUNTING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [PHONE RINGING] Flea here. RANDOM (ON PHONE): Flea, you find the Sekis for us? This must be some kind of miracle or something. I think it's a museum-- New Orleans Museum of Art. They gone inside, but I don't think they're in a rush to come out. RANDOM (ON PHONE): Three minutes, Flea. We're coming in. Over and out. Random! Davalos! [STATIC ON RADIO] Random! Davalos! What is it? POLK (ON RADIO): I'll be there in five minutes with two SWAT teams. Get out now, and everything'll be all right. Things will go back to the way they were. That's in your mind. You changed the laws again, Polk. POLK (ON RADIO): You've broken your word. If you're still there when we get there, it'll be like you're both with them. He must have intercepted Flea's call. Flea, I need to ask you something. What do you want? I'll To anything. This'll be your greatest job. Yeah? Would you go inside and talk to Kon Seki for me? You want me to fix things up? I want you to bring him to me. Careful, Flea. Are you with this, Random? If I wasn't, you'd already be dead. Somehow I knew that. [MUSIC PLAYING] There's someone in the parking lot wishing to address you. Yes. This is not a situation of actuality. This is. I'm not fooling you. We understand. Be ready when I get back. [MUSIC PLAYING] So you're the one who sent them to us. Everyone has a job. Your job is important to you? It's all I had. [MUSIC PLAYING] Please. He say he'll come out and talk with you all. You did good. Take him. [GRUNTING] [DOOR CLOSING] [GRUNTING] Mr. Flea, what happened to you, huh? I think I got shot, brother, I-- Ah, blood. I think it went through. You'll be all right. Hey, you did good. Couldn't have done it without me. RANDOM: You're right. Officer Random. Mr. Flea. [MUSIC PLAYING] In five minutes, we'll be surrounded by SWAT teams. I understand. Whatever happens to you will happen to us. A warrior does not think of victory or defeat, life or death. He plunges recklessly to an irrational death. By doing so, he awakens from the dream. [MUSIC PLAYING] KON SEKI: Aiko! [GUN CLICKING] What'd he say? [GUN CLICKING] It's what he didn't say. [GUN CLICKS] What are we going to do? We plunge recklessly. [MUSIC PLAYING] RANDOM: They're going to try and kill us. DAVALOS: They're going to give their lives to us. She'll come at you like a bird. Stay centered, take your shot. I don't know if I can do this. You don't have to.

[PANTING] I always believed that if a man has been a true warrior, when he dies, those around him can feel wind from his body. [GRUNTING] Yes. [MUSIC PLAYING] [POLICE SHOUTING] Who's got Davalos? We've got him in a van, sir. OK. Who's watching him? - Nobody. We've got him cuffed. Good. Cuffed? [MUSIC PLAYING] Davos, you son of a bitch. [ROCK MUSIC PLAYING] [MOTORCYCLE RUMBLING] [MUSIC PLAYING]
