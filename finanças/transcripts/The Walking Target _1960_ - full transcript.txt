(dramatic orchestral music) (dramatic orchestral music) - Harbin, you'll be getting out of here in a few minutes. You've been a model prisoner. Neat, willing, courteous, hard working, I'd feel real good about this except for one thing. I know you've just been marking time, waiting to get your hands on that money. Nick, I'd hope we could talk. - I've served my time, Warden. The State's all finished with me now. - As long as that money is missing, there'll be spotlight right on you. You stole it and hid it so it couldn't be found. All right. From now on all you have to do is sneeze, and the police will be right there with a tape recorder. - I'm a free man. I'll take my chances. - I was hoping you got smarter. You came here wild and dumb. For a while, I thought you were learning something. Going to school, being cooperative. You're no smarter. Just older. - I figured I'm smart enough. - All right. Your time's up. And, Nick, remember this. You're no ordinary ex-con. You're a walking target. (dramatic orchestral music) - Well, Nick, honey, it's me, Sue. Oh, Nick baby, I came to meet you. - Thanks a lot. You're looking good. - Oh, thanks, hon. - But you would have looked a lot better in there. Just once in five years? - Well, Nick, I, Nick, it was those walls. I couldn't go in there. I tried. Baby, I'll make it up to you. - [Al] Harbin? - Hey, look out. (dramatic orchestral music) - Hey, I, uh, I'm Al Kramer, The Record. Tell me, how does it feel to get out? Got any plans? - Yeah. Peace and solitude. - What? - Peace and solitude, Kramer. Five years ago I didn't know what they meant. Now I know, and I'm gonna enjoy it. - Harbin. Max Brodney, Headquarters. Detective Squad. - Big cop, huh? - That's right. I'm a cop. You're a louse. - Careful, cop, or I'll sue you for slander. - Well, I heard you got yourself an education inside. You're not so quick with the hands anymore, huh? - I'm a law abiding citizen. - No, you're not. You're smart, Harbin. But you're still a louse. I'll see you around. (engine starting) Probably on a slab. (dramatic orchestral music) - Think he knows where the money is? - Sure, sure. You know, Lieutenant, he was sizing me up. Like he was figuring whether he could take me or not. - You're bigger than he is. - Yeah. And I could see him figuring just how to move if he had to. - Whatever move he makes, you make it too. There'll come a time when he'll go for the money. You be there. - I'll help him count it. (dramatic orchestral music) - This is one of the things I've been dreaming about. Just driving any place, anywhere I want. - Is that all you dreamed about, Nick? - What's the pitch, Susie? - It's no pitch, Nick, it's just, baby, can't we pick it up again? - Just like that? After nothing? Five stinking years of nothing? - Nick, I was just a kid. I was scared. I just couldn't... - All right, Susie. We'll try it again, huh? (light orchestral music) Well, I guess nothing could change this old place. - Well, you put it in my name, Nick. I figured I could keep it. For you. - For me? But I gave it to you, Susie. A long time ago. You know, I, thought we were heading this way, but I couldn't remember. But anyway, it's a, it's a real welcome. - Hey, cut it out, will you? I'm blushing. Hey, Nick. - Davey boy, it's good to see you. - How are, hey, let go, you cement crusher. Welcome home, Nick. You know, I, I tried to visit you but no dice. No ex-cons get in except to stay. - Yeah, yeah. I know. - Oh, boys, the important thing now is that we're all here. Safe and together. - That's right. And with both of you here, it's a real homecoming, so here's a toast. To Nick Harbin. A toast to five years of my life. (glass shattering) - Oh, Nicky, are you still the wild man? The human dynamo. Never walks, always running. - I'm not gonna run anymore. - Oh, Nicky, honey, you didn't have to blow up a storm. - Boy, are you still nervous! - Yeah, yeah, I'm sorry. I, uh, I got some sense kicked in me in five years, but I, I usually don't go off like that anymore. - Ah, forget it. You know, you look in wonderful shape, Nick. Solid. - Oh, yeah, Davey, I kept in good condition, all right. They, uh, in there, you gotta keep moving. You gotta do something or you go crazy. - Nick, honey, relax. It's all over now. - Sure, come on, here, let's drink to the good times. To the future, huh? - All right. Yeah, here's to the future. May she be fat and rich. Ah! - Well, now, what's the pitch? Well, you know, the loot. The bundle. - Look, Dave, all I want right now is a good suit. And then a real dinner. I want a steak. A big steak. And a knife to cut it with. Look, kids. First I gotta relax. Then I can start planning. The first plan is you and me. - Nick, still the fast talk? - No fast talk, baby. I've been dreaming too long, now I'm gonna start living. - Okay, Nick. We'll talk later. Shall we have dinner here? - My treat. The biggest steak in town. And, don't get anxious, Nick. It's just a steak. And I'll stay at home with my knitting, and I'll leave you two all alone. - Davey, you're still my boy. - I'll take it. - But right now I got a little shopping to do. - Oh, what are you using for money? - Money. Well, Davey, I sowed mail sacks, I made gift boxes, and I combed jute, and I saved my dough. I got nearly a 1000 bucks on me, so don't worry. I'm loaded. And you, you just make yourself beautiful and that steak medium rare, huh? (light orchestral music) - Hon? Hurry back. He's gone. - That big ape. (glass shattering) Laying his hands on you like, Like, first plan, you and me. - Well, darling, after all. (light orchestral music) Take me, take me. - I almost threw my drink in his face. - Oh, baby, no. You remember how fast he was with his hands? Why, he would have killed you. After all, I was his girl. - That was five years ago. - Dave, I hid it, too. I dunno, maybe we should just get out of here. Forget him and the lousy money. - Forget 260,000 bucks? Now, look, now, look, baby, I want everything to be right with us. Everything silk and stable. And, baby, we'll cash in and we'll coast forever, huh? - Okay. But I don't want you hurt. You know, double crossing Nick might be too dangerous. - Forget it. Nick hasn't got a chance. Not the way I got things set up. So, don't you worry, huh? (light orchestral music) (dramatic orchestral music) - That DA's a cocker spaniel. He's always nipping at my heels. - Well, we put a muzzle on him this time. Arnie? - Mmm? - Do you still intend to do something about Nick Harbin? - You talking about muscle? Muscle is for hoods. I'm a business man. I'm gonna take that money away from Harbin the minute he goes after it. - Well, we don't want to stir up anything just now. - Harbin doesn't know me, I don't know him. How could I possibly be connected with anything? - Well, there's always a possibility that, uh, that payroll money is still hot. - This guy, Prince, brought me a deal worth almost a quarter of a million dollars. You expect me to pass up something like that? (door bell ringing) That'll be Prince now. When people want a deal handled right, Paul, they come to the guy who can do it for them. I'm a useful citizen in this community. You always forget that. - I never forget it. You pay me a $100,000 a year. (laughing) - Hi, kid. - Hello, Mr. Hoffman. - It's all right, you can talk. You find out anything from Harbin? - No, he's still wound up. Won't make conversation. But tonight's his first night out. He's gonna be with his girl. He'll tell her. - And she'll tell him. You see, Paul? No problem. Have a drink? - Yeah, please. - I'm counting on your complete loyalty, Prince. - And you have it, Mr. Hoffman. Look, I'm no sucker. I get my 10%, that's 26,000 bucks. I'm a happy man. - No worries about crossing your pal? - He's not paying for my loyalty. - You're a smart boy. If this goes all right, maybe we'll do some regular business. - Thanks. I'll keep in touch. - Do that. (dramatic orchestral music) - Okay, stick with it then. And try and get a picture. Which of the camera boys is available? - Mmm, Johnny Lang. You've used him before, Al. - Okay, you got Lang. When Harbin makes a try for the dough, we want to get the story first. - There was a cop waiting for him, too. Max Brodney. - Hmm, the Iron Man. Harbin's in trouble then. - Yeah, Harbin's a pretty cagey boy. Maybe he can think faster than Brodney can throw a punch. - That was real good, Susie. I'd forgotten what a steak tasted like. Or real coffee. - Is that all you can think about, hmm? What's the matter? Do I taste like onions, or something? - Honey, look, it's been five years. I can't unwind in just a few hours, you know. Besides, I got too many ideas to think about. And to many problems, too. - Tell Sue, darling, you wouldn't, be thinking about buried treasures, eh? - Whatever happened to Sammy Russo's pa? - Russo? Russo? Oh, the old Italian guy? Well, you know, Nick. When Sammy got shot, he sang on you and the whole deal. - But not where the money was hidden. - Well, no, Nick, but everything else. Then after he died, why, his pa began lushing it up and putting away about a quarter of that red ink a day. He got caught in the rain or something. Anyway, he got pneumonia and, (snapping fingers) - Yeah, that was my fault, too. I talked Sammy into it. - Well, Nick, it was a good deal. A quarter of a million dollars. Brother! - Yeah. Yeah, that was such a good deal, they're both dead. - Honey, you're all right, and that's all that's important. - No, Susie, look, it isn't that easy. Look, you do something, anything, it doesn't matter. Right away, 100 people, People you don't even know, they get caught up in it, and they get dragged along. (exhales sharply) Sam's wife, Gail, what happened to her? - Well, how should I know? She took off. - I asked you to look her up. - Well, I did. But she moved. I never did like her anyway. Her with her big brown eyes. You've always had a yen for that little farmer's daughter, haven't you? - I said it was my fault Sammy's dead. I owe his wife something. - Well, what are you going to give her, Nick? A cut of that cheap grand you saved up in the pen? - Sammy's share of the loot is going to her. - Nicky, Then you have got it. A quarter of a, a quarter of a million bucks. Nick, honey, if there is anything you need, any help I can, I can get you some front men or whatever you want. - Relax, will you? Look, baby, every cop in the state's got an eye out for me. I can't just go down to the corner and start digging. - Well, of course not, darling. Maybe I can get it for you. (laughing) - Sweet, Sue. You know, 260,000 bucks is a pretty big package. I don't think you could even lift it. - I was only trying to help, Nick. - Yeah, sure. Yeah, yeah, the town's full of helpers. Really good beavers. They can smell that green around corners. And if I so much as sneeze, that cop Brodney is right there with a handkerchief. - Well, it's worth it, isn't it, Nick? What have we ever had? Baby, now you can have anything you want. And maybe I can get a cut of it. - Sure. Sure, honey, there's, always room for one more. (knocking on door) - I don't know. - [Max] Open up, Harbin. - It's that cop. - Good evening, Nick. Nice little pad you've got here. - My friends call me, Nick, and you weren't invited. - Don't quote your civil rights at me, Harbin. Who owns this joint? - I do. - And who are you? - Susan Mallory. - Born Sofia Mancowsky, three appearances juvenile court. Two arrests, one for accosting, one for accessory after burglary. - I didn't ask for your fat face, cop. And I don't have to take any lip from you. Now, get out of here. - Nicky. - Harbin, you're a louse and a louse takes what he can get. Now, if I thought that you had that money stashed around here, I'd bounce your head around like a basketball. - Well try. - Tough, huh? Real muscle? - Nicky, I've heard about this one. He gets his kicks beating up on- - Just remember, Harbin. Where ever you go, just listen. I'll be there. - Nicky, he's gonna stay right on top of you. That's why you gotta tell me where the money is, so I can get it while they're tailing you. - And I told you I'm gonna take care of it. A cut goes to Gail Russo. And then we'll get outta here. - Oh, you're just dying to set her up, aren't you? - Where are you going? - Out. Back to town. Well, I can't stay here with that flat-footed peeping tom running around outside. - Yeah, sure. Run along. - Nicky, it doesn't make any difference, does it? I mean, it's just that I feel funny 'cause, well, Nicky, the idea, the cop's right outside. - It's all right. Go on, I said. Should've known they'd track me down here anyway. I'll see you tomorrow. - Sure. We'll figure it out then. Hmm? (dramatic orchestral music) - [Man] Harbin. (glass shattering) See you at The Record tomorrow. (dramatic orchestral music) - Dave, he'll be back. You'll see. - Great. Wonderful. Quarter of a million bucks. And you got to play it innocent. - I couldn't stand him pawing me. - He was all right for you once, wasn't he? Now you better pray. Pray he's not on a fast flight to South America. - Dave, he will be back. You'll see. - Well, he better. - Changed my mind. Take me to the Commonwealth by the stockyards. - Well, he knows we're on his tail. - Fine. I want him to know it. Every time he takes a breath. (dramatic orchestral music) (cows mooing) - Hey, Mister, you trying to get yourself killed? - You kidding? I've been doing this since I was 10. Look, kid. Tell that big ape I got things to do, and I don't want him nosing around, will you? (light orchestral music) (cows mooing) - That guy must be nuts or something. - You should be so nuts. - He said he had something to take care of. Didn't want you nosing around. - What's the quickest way to the other side where he's going? - You gotta go all the way back. Aisle B. Then around 28th, and then on down, - Thanks. (dramatic orchestral music) - Hey. What do you want in here, Mister? - I'm, uh, I'm looking for somebody. Who are you? - Packy. Everybody around here knows Packy. You won't find nobody else. Except me. - You know Mrs. Gail Russo? - Now listen, Mister, when she moved out of here she said I could stay here. She gave me permission. Honest, Mister. - You mean she lived here? - Sure. After she rented the house, she moved in here. - Why would she live in a filthy place like this? - She didn't have no money, Mister. Ah, the roof don't leak. - She could've got a job. (Packy chuckling) - In this town? No. She wouldn't stay here. She hated this place. I guess she hated everybody except me. She gave me a sweatshirt and fur pants. Hmm. - Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I guess she had a right to hate everybody. - Uh, she was just gonna stay here till she gets off the garage, but people stopped buying stuff in this neighborhood 30 years ago. You know Mrs. Russo pretty good, Mister? - Yeah, Packy. Pretty good. Look, uh, you said she couldn't sell the garage and she took off. Where? - Uh, I ain't have much of a memory lately. Let's see. She didn't have much. Suitcase. Some boxes. She put them in the car. - Car? What Car? - Her car. - Was that a two door sedan, green? - Hey, listen, you ain't from the finance company are you, Mister? - No, Packy. Not that kind of finance. - Uh, if you can tell me who this fellow is, maybe I'll believe you. - Sammy Russo. Where did you get this? - It was stuck in the back of the bureau. That was her husband. We could have some coffee. The dishes are clean. Coffee helps me to remember more. Maybe it'll help me remember that place she went to. - Make mine black. - I guess her husband was a pretty nice fellow, huh? Yeah. Girl like that wouldn't marry no bum. She's no better. Fellow's lucky to find a good girl when he's young. Makes a guy watch his P's and Q's. (dramatic orchestral music) - This is sort of a gag for Gail. It's our first months anniversary present. - Oh, very sweet. Oh, Sammy. In a couple of hours, you're gonna be able to buy her a diamond ring about as big as your fist. - Nick, not so loud, huh? - Why? - Look, she's coming over here. I don't wanna worry her. - You didn't tell her, did you, Sammy? - About the payroll? - Yeah. - No, honest, course I didn't, Nick. No. - You had me going for a second. - Look, Nick. Look, she wants me to get out of messing around with hot rods. She don't want me talking about big money. She wants me to get a steady job. Nick, that's why I put in with you. I need money. I wanna buy a garage in a paying neighborhood. - A garage? - Yeah. - Sammy. Look, boy. You're gonna be loaded. Don't you know what that means? You gonna be loaded. You won't have to mess around with this actual grease anymore. - I like working with cars. Look, Gail's father's got a restaurant out in Arizona. A little place called Gold City. Gail said the only reason she married me is because I don't smell from bacon grease. - Gail, Gail. Judas, Sammy! It didn't take you long to get pounded to size, did it? - Sam, you inside? - Hi, baby. - Hi. Oh, you taste like machine oil. - I'm sorry, honey. I forgot. - Oh, here. I fixed a lunch for you. You know for the big job this afternoon. - Oh! - Oh, the job, sure. - Hey, didn't you bring anything for me? - Well, I figured you'd eat Sam's anyway, so I packed double. (Sammy chuckles) - Well, I'll put this inside. - You were working on something in there? I didn't know you had anything going here. - Oh, nothing important. Something just came up. A valve job. No. I mean, No. Stay out and talk to Nick. I'll be right back. - Cigarette? - No. - Relax, Gail. Sammy doesn't have a chick in there, you know. - Well, I didn't think he did. - I think you forgot something. Today is your one month anniversary. Sammy's got your car in there, Gail. He's fixing it up for you. He's polishing it. And grease job and seat covers, and the whole works, you know. It's his idea of a hot anniversary present. - Well, I think it's a lovely present. It's thoughtful and sweet. - Oh, sure. Sammy, he's a sweet guy. He's not a heel like me. - That isn't funny. - I know it. It wasn't really supposed to be. - Oh, Nick, why can't you leave us alone? - Us? Sammy doesn't know, Gail. It's not bothering him, just me. And you. - Nick, I married Sam. I intend to stick by that marriage. I'm not going to let it bother me. - Sure, sure. You just turn it on and off like a faucet. How do you think I feel hanging around here like a big third wheel watching you and Sam... Okay. All right. I'm gonna get outta here. With a little luck, Gail, by tomorrow, you can just start forgetting all about me. (exhaling) - Nick, I'm sorry. I know it's been difficult for you too. - Just a little longer, Nick, and we'll be all finished. - Look, I think I better run along home. Do a good job. Bye, Nick. - That's the word. Goodbye, Gail. - Think she's gonna be all right, huh, Nick? - Yeah. Yeah, sure. Come on, Sammy. - Oh, Nick, I'm scared stiff. I'm sweating. - Of course you're sweating, Sammy. It's hot outside. It's July. Look, pretty soon you can buy yourself a room full of air conditioners. Let's take a look at the First National. - I covered it in case she came in here. Look, Nick, I still don't like the idea of using her car. - No, she won't even know. Besides, where else can we find anything as safe as this, huh? We got Arizona plates from another state, see. Nobody even knows she's got a car. Now what cops gonna connect that up, huh? - Nick, maybe there'll be trouble. - That's it, Sammy. If there is trouble, we just hop in this car, and we drive away. We're tourists from Arizona, that's all. What you got under here, huh? - See this. It's clean in here. You put the money in here. Rock wool goes on top. Huh? Take this piece. Slides in there. You weld this and it's there for years. - Yeah, yeah, it's all right, Sammy. Yeah, but couple of months will be plenty. Then the heat will die down, and you and I, We're gonna start living right. It's getting a little late. We better get ready. Okay, here's what happens. Jerry will be in the store with the car parked across the street down a ways. You and I will come up opposite sides of the street. Now when the guard brings that dough out the side entrance, you slug it. - Nick, are you sure it'll work? - What's the matter with you, Sammy? - Sure, I'm sure it will work! Look. We jump him. We slug him. You grab the dough. You give it to Jerry when he comes driving by. And then you get Gail's car, and I go in the opposite direction. You meet Jerry. You get the dough. He dumps the hot car, and we lock it up. That's all. - That's all. That's all, huh? Nick, couldn't we use a sap or a gun maybe? - Don't be a stupid jerk, Sammy. So we carry a little piece of wood. What's a little piece of wood? Nobody will even notice it, kid. Look, with this thing you can hit just like you're using a ball bat. (dramatic orchestral music) (suspenseful orchestral music) (tires screeching) (gun firing) (car crashing) Right, go get the car. Hurry up. (suspenseful orchestral music) (tires screeching) Let's go, let's go. Get those plates. All right, get the front one. All right. Get that torch going. - Nick, Nick, Jerry got shot. He's, he's dead. - Sammy, you come to. You hear me? We gotta get this money hidden. Look, kid. There's a fortune there. There's a lot more than we figured. Now you get under that car. (dramatic orchestral music) - [Packy] Coffee's ready. - Did you make enough, Packy, to help you remember? - A whole pot. You know, I've been trying to think, you'd figure a young girl like that would go home instead of- - Home? Packy, have you ever heard of a place called Gold City in Arizona? - Yeah! Yeah, that's it, Mister. Arizona. That's what she said. - Look, Packy, you got to be sure. Now are you sure? - Coffee's never failed me yet. - Okay, here. You buy yourself 10 pounds. (dramatic orchestral music) - Morning, Gail. - Good Morning. - Seen the city paper? - No, I haven't. - It's that hoodlum again. The one you used to know. (dramatic orchestral music) Dearie, you look off your feet. - It's sweet of you to be so concerned. Here you can sell this at a higher price. It's got my fingerprints on it. (dramatic orchestral music) - [Lank] Gail? - Good morning, Lank. - Stew's on. It'll be ready for lunch. - Have we enough ham left? - Yes, Ma'am. - All right, Lank, thanks. - Uh, I've seen the papers on the way over. - So did I. Imagine the whole town will see them before long. We ought to do a big lunch business. - Gail? I was working for your father right here in this place when you were born. And I was working here when he died. I guess I even got to think like him. So, if there's any kind of advice you want- - Just when I thought people were beginning to forget about my husband and Nick Harbin, and all that mess. Then it has to come out again in the papers. - You know, looking through that window, I've seen a lot of people come and go. It seems to me, they're always ready to remember the bad and forget the good. So, I don't figure you owe nobody any apologies. - That is the way my father would have said it. - One thing I'd sure like to do, lay a meat cleaver to that Nick Harbin scum. - Oh, he's paid for what he did. - Yeah, but you didn't do nothing. But you paid for it more. (dramatic orchestral music) - [Man] Unit three-two, unit three-two, come in please, over. - [Max] Three-two reporting, three-two reporting, over. - Max, I think he's been in there alone for a long time. - We got no place to go. (dramatic orchestral music) (Susan giggling) - Oh! Honey. Honey, honey, it's late. - Oh, relax, will you? We'll hear him. With all those cops out there watching into him- - You might not. (suspenseful orchestral music) "Welcome home, Nick." - Nick, baby, please, you don't- - You get some clothes on. - What're you gonna do, Nick? - Well, I could beat your face in. - Now look, Nick, you know, Sue and me, we, we got together when you were put away. - Oh, never mind, Dave. You can't talk to the great Nick Harbin. What did you expect me to do? Sit around in a convent waiting for you for five years? - I didn't expect a thing. Not a thing. Except maybe you two would try to chisel a little. You, I figured for a quick deal. I got money and you got the cut. But I didn't figure on supporting you. - You have no right to talk to me like that. - I don't have to talk at all! Here you are, baby. A little room rent. I'm leaving tomorrow. Right now, you two are getting out of here. - No! No, we're all going, Nick. All of us. - Well, dumber and dumber I get, huh? Just figured you to chisel, but, you're after the whole bundle, aren't you, buddy? - That's right, buddy boy, that's right. Now, come on. Come on, I want you to meet a friend. Doll, out the back way. We don't wanna disturb anybody. (dramatic orchestral music) - Maybe I better check. - Suit yourself. (knocking on door) - Max! (tires screeching) (suspenseful orchestral music) - [Man] Unit three-two, unit three-two, come in, please, over. - Unit three-two reporting. Three-two reporting, go ahead, over. - [Man] Code two, Nick Harbin seen in blue convertible. Repeat, Nick Harbin in blue convertible headed north on Beverly Drive. - Roger, 302, over and out. (suspenseful orchestral music) - Now, get out. - Prince, you're an idiot. - I couldn't help it, Mr. Hoffman. He got wise. - That's done. You, you got any brains? - What's your deal? - (laughing) Well, that's sensible talk. Prince here, he was in for 10%, if he got a handle on the dough. You scratch in, and you get 10%. And in addition, you get his 10% as a bonus. (chuckling) All right, Arnie, you're on. - No! Now look, Mr. Hoffman, I got him here, didn't I? I tried! I come to you in the first place. - We did everything we could! - Sad. Make your deal with Harbin. - Look, Nick, this just isn't fair. - Maybe you're right, Davey. Maybe you're right. Where're the keys to your car? - Still in it, why? I don't get it! - All right, I'll spell it out for you. You see, I was gonna turn the money in, that's all. Just so I could relax. - Are you stir crazy, Harbin? Why, that dough isn't even hot anymore. - Maybe not to you, Hoffman. So I don't want it, Davey. None of it. You can have my share. - What? (suspenseful orchestral music) - [Arnie] Hey! What's going on? (grunting) - Harbin, you can't foul me up! - All right, big shot. You want that money? You try coming after me. (suspenseful orchestral music) (tires screeching) - It's Harbin. (suspenseful orchestral music) (suspenseful orchestral music) (tires screeching) (cars crashing) (dramatic orchestral music) - Sorry, mister. I got another job. I got a motor conked out, and it's gonna take me at least a week to fix it. - Okay, then just, fill her up. I'll get mine hammered out later. (dramatic orchestral music) And, check that oil and water too, huh? - We were lucky getting that filling station report this morning. Only about two highways he can take. Bottom of Nevada or maybe Arizona. (knocking on door) - Can't you read the sign? We're closed. - Hey, Mac, I, uh, wanna find out something. I wanna talk to you. - See what he wants, Lank. - Yeah, what do you want? Hey, you deaf or something, Mister? What do you... (dramatic orchestral music) (exhaling) - Come in, Nick. (door closing) - Hello, Gail. - Nick? Nick Harbin? - Any chance of me getting a sandwich? - Sandwich? Why you crook, get out of here or- - Lank! - Well, you've had enough trouble. You don't want no more. - I won't give her any. - Lank, just drop your mop, and you go on home. - And leave you here alone? - Don't worry, Lank, I left my machine gun out in the car. - I'll be all right. Just leave things there. Go on home, please, Lank. - She'd better be all right, Mister. She'd just better be all right. - All I have left is some ham. - That'll be fine, Gail. - Nick, when you're through eating, I want you to leave. I want you to get out of Gold City. - Don't you even wanna know why I came? - No! I don't wanna hear anything you have to say, not a word, just get out. Just leave me alone. - Look, I, I know how you feel. - If you did, you wouldn't have come here. - Gail, Sammy, he meant a lot to me too, you know? - I had to bury him. - Well, he wasn't underage, you know. He knew what he was getting into. - All Sam knew was cars. And that other one, Jerry. They're both dead. (Gail sobbing) I hate you for making me remember. How'd you find me? - The old man, Packy, he said you went home. Sammy told me once where you came from. Gail, I, uh, I brought you something. I thought you might want it. (dramatic orchestral music) - Why? I've had this to help me remember for five years. (dramatic orchestral music) - Why did you do it? You saved it, so you wouldn't forget to hate my guts? I came here on account of Sammy and you. Okay, I'll, uh, I'll do what I came for and then I'll get out. You still got your car? That two door sedan, green? - Car? In the garage at the house, why? - Well, that means that half the money's yours. - What? - The money, the payroll, Gail. It's half yours. - And you think I'd take it? Sam came home that night. He was shaking. I thought he was sick. When I went for the doctor, Sam wandered off. - I know, it broke him up when he saw Jerry- - Get killed. Say it. Sam was trying to walk it off. Policemen called him over, and he started running. They called me at two o'clock in the morning. He was delirious. And dying. (Gail sobbing) (dramatic orchestral music) You take your money. You burn it, you give it away. I don't care what you do with it, I don't want it. - Gail, you got it. Sammy put it in the frame section underneath the car. - So, that's why you came here? That's why the big play? Half to me, big man. - No, Gail, no. I could have come at night and taken your car, and headed for Mexico. No. - What did they do to you in prison? Convert you? - They gave me a little time. I had nothing but time there. I went to school, and I did a little thinking. - Made big plans? - Little ones. I was gonna get a job. I was gonna get out and get married, maybe. I was just tired of running, that's all. I, I wanted to stay put. I wanted to belong to something, just somewhere. And now here I am again in a stolen car, see? I'm running again. - You could have stayed out of trouble. What happened? I thought I had friends! They're just like everybody else. Just itching to get their hands on that money. Gail, why don't you take it, huh? I'll head for the border, they'll follow me. Nobody will even know you've got it. It's a lot of dough, honey. You can get out of this town. You can just go wherever you want! - You really are trying to make it up to Sam, aren't you? - To both of you. - Oh, Nick, I'm tired. I don't know what to tell you. - Can we talk tomorrow? - This is a small town, but they get newspapers here too. If you went to a hotel, it would just make that much more trouble. - All right, then I'll, uh, I'll sleep in the car. - My place is right up the street. You can have my father's room. - Well, that's, that's the only decent words I heard since I got out. I'll take this with me. I might be able to eat it now. (dramatic orchestral music) - Come on, think, think. - Dave, I can't remember, I tried. - Look, you heard Arnie Hoffman. You wanna windup dead? Look, now, we know Nick was tracing Gail Russo. - I know. - All right. You knew Gail. You knew Sam. Now, she went home. Home! - Some crummy little town. - Where? - Oh, in Arizona I think. - Where in Arizona? - Silver City. - Silver City. Come on. Find it. There's no Silver City in Arizona. - Dave, I'm sorry, I, oh! Dave, please- - Think. Think hard. - Well, - Where? Come on. - Gold. - Gold, Gold what? - Gold City, that's the name! - Are you sure? - Well, uh. Gold City. - Gold. Gold City. Arnie Hoffman? Dave Prince. - I never heard of this Gold City. You sure you got it right? - Well, Susie says that's where the girl used to live. Now we can't be sure that she's there now. - She better be there. I don't like wasting time. How much farther? - Let's see, it's 200 miles, maybe 250. - Boy, Sammy sure knew his job! He welded this plate on like it was never supposed to come off. - What will you do when you get it off, Nick? - I told you, we'll talk about it. First I gotta make sure it's still in here. Five years is a long time, you know? - I don't like leaving Lank with the cooking and serving at the cafe. (dramatic orchestral music) - Gail, I've got it. It's in here. Every bit of it. Gail, you hear me? - Yes, Nick, I heard. (exhaling) - Here's a couple of samples, Gail. Just a couple of samples. Did you ever figure, you've been driving the most expensive car in the world? - You've got the money now, Nick. There's a big difference between thinking about it and holding it like that. (Nick sighing) - In all my life I heard people saying, "Boy, if I only had dough. If I were only rich." - Depends on how you get it. - There's a lot of guys who didn't bother. - You were one of them. - Yeah. Look, you, uh, you take this. You burn it, give it away, Do anything with it. Go to Europe. I don't care. And that's all I've got to give you. - I told you, you don't owe me anything. - I wasn't talking about owing. I was talking about giving. You know what it's like, Gail, to think about somebody every day for five years? And not be able to do anything about it? You know what it was like last night in your father's room? Right next to yours? - Nick, please. - I wasn't making a pass, Gail. I'm just telling you. I know what a louse you thought I was. I was hoping maybe it wouldn't be like that. Maybe you'd be willing to forget what happened, but, so, I was wrong, but at least it kept me going. - Nick, please, I can't- - Don't say anything, Gail, you don't have to. So, please, just don't even try. (sighing) - Nick. Would you give the money back? - You tell me. That's all I need. (dramatic orchestral music) - Nick. Would they stop bothering you, if you gave it back. - They'd probably give me a medal. - Then we could leave together. - Leave? - We could give them the money and get out of Gold City. We could go anywhere we want. Oh, Nick, we could start all over. - What about your restaurant? - Well, Lank can have that. He's certainly worked hard enough all these years. Oh, you could get a job. We're not fooling ourselves, are we? - Honey, we're not fooling ourselves. We gotta made it this time. Come on. Let's get the rest of the money out of there and go tell Lank the good news, huh? We can catch him before he closes for the night. (dramatic orchestral music) (grunting) - Well, what's that for? - Oh, hiding it under the back seat till, we're ready to go to the cops. And can just see Lank's face when we tell him the good news, huh? (light orchestral music) - Yeah, I'll talk to you later. Okay. I went back to the files, dug up a lead on the Russo woman. Where she came from. - That'll help. - Look up a place in the map called Gold City. There it is. - Oh, God! The gas station said she ran a cafe around here. There's gotta be a cafe around here some place. - Why would anybody wanna live in a cemetery like this? Before he dies. Nine o'clock, its dead already! You, you idiot! If it hadn't been for you, I wouldn't be going through this. - Well, I couldn't help it about Harbin. You know, wait a minute, there it is. Gold City Cafe. - Pull up here. (dramatic orchestral music) Go in and see what you can find out. (register ringing) - Not too much left. - Cup of coffee will do. Is, Mrs. Russo around? - No, she's not. You want something? - No, I'm just an old friend of hers from LA. You know where I can find her? - No, I don't. You ought to gimme your name, I can tell her. - I wanna surprise her. - Well, she ought to be in pretty soon to go over tomorrow's menu with me. - Thanks, pal. - Yes, sir. (dramatic orchestral music) - She's not there. The old guy's expecting her back in a few minutes. - Good, we'll be waiting. Check the silencers to make sure they work. (dramatic orchestral music) All right, let's go. - The seat stay in place all right? - It's fine. - Okay, first thing in the morning, we're gonna take that money to the sheriff here in Gold City. You know, when I think of Brodney and Hoffman, and the newspaper guys, all of them with their own reasons for cutting my throat. Just waiting for me to go for that money. Well, there's gonna be a lot of flipped lids when they find out I've given it back. - You're not beginning to feel sorry about it? - honey, remember that old gag, "Happiness won't buy money?" I found out today it's, uh, it's no gag. - Lank must be in the kitchen. - Well, let's get him out of there. - Welcome home, Nick. - Don't move, Harbin. - Nick, what- - Good luck with that old guy, he told me to tell you he's all tied up in the kitchen. - How did you find me, Hoffman? - Prince, door. - These are the goons I told you about. All that's missing are the cops and the newspapers. - No cops, no newspaper reporters. Just a friendly little meeting. You were very cute back in LA, Nick. I don't like guys to get cute with me. - Well, you should have told me, Hoffman, I didn't know. - Now you know, so now we talk about the money. Being out in the night air makes me lose my voice. You lost yours too, Mrs. Russo? - Don't touch her! - You worried about her, Nick? Dave told me how Nick feels about you, Mrs. Russo. He was right. Nick doesn't want to see you hurt. So, suppose we think about it this way, Nick. My boy here, he takes off his coat so that Mrs. Russo can see how strong he is. - Hoffman, if he so- - Easy, Nick, easy. - I've seen some of the jobs my boys done on women. Very good. Now, what do you say, Nick? Do we talk about the money before he messes her up, or after? - Look, Hoffman, if your goon touches her, you're gonna have to kill me. Then who's gonna find the dough for you? - Who wants to kill you, Nick? Davey boy here will just shoot you in the leg, that's all. - Nick they're crazy, they've got to be. - Take her. Go ahead. - Make one move, Nick, you're gonna get it. - [Gail] Lank! (Gail screaming) (gun firing) (grunting) - [Arnie] Prince! (suspenseful orchestral music) - Get some water and dump on his head. He's no good to us if he can't talk. Maybe you ought to convince Nick that you don't wanna get marked up. - I'm so blurry, I can't see. - Just keep looking. Gotta be here some place. - Out of the way, doll. - There it is. Biggest life, Gold City Cafe. Pull in here, I don't want any surprises. - Help him, Dave. Nick's having trouble. (suspenseful orchestral music) - I'll make that croon talk. - Prince! Nobody does anything around here without my saying so. Now, I've had enough of this yackety-yack. Get over here! (suspenseful orchestral music) Get the girl. (Gail screaming) - Watch it, Nick. Watch it. 260,000 bucks worth. - Watch yourself. (suspenseful orchestral music) (gun firing) (gun firing) (gun firing) (suspenseful orchestral music) (grunting) (grunting) - [Max] Don't try it, Hoffman. (suspenseful orchestral music) - Okay, Hoffman, all right. You wanted to mark her out, huh? Right, I'm gonna see how you can take it. - No, Nick, no! - You did a classy job on the goon. Don't go spoiling it now. - What you want, cop? You want him walk out of here? Who's gonna take him? - What's the matter? You think I'm dead? - [Gail] You're badly hurt, I better call a doctor. - Yeah. - Nick, please. - Why don't you listen to her? Drop the bottle. - My God! Okay. Your money's in the car, under the back seat. - I'm in no shape to stop you if you wanna take it and make a run for it. - So, what do you think, cop? I got a little religion 'cause I stopped that goon from finishing you? - You wouldn't have done it five years ago. - Gail and I were taking the money tomorrow morning to the sheriff here. If you can still walk, you can go with us. - Hey. To see that, I'd go in an ambulance. - The doctor will be here in a few minutes. And the police. - Thanks. Oh, I better sit down. (chuckling) You're helping me! Boy, that is a hot one. (dramatic orchestral music) (light orchestral music)
