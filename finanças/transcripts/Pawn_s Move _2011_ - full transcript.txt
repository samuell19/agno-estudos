There's this correlation with age. - You're slow to move. - I'm 86. (whimsical instrumental music) - Have an accident? - No, my sister's in beauty school. Can I see it? - It's on top of the case. (slow-tempo instrumental music) We oughtta give him that piece. - It's a $2,000 piece, Harvey. Any chance you'll move? - Nothing takes place by chance. - So am I witnessing an act of God? - He does move us. - In mysterious ways? - Sometimes. Don't you have deliveries, Irving? - I do. - (clears throat) - Mmm. Sorry. - (clicking sound) My duty is to move the pieces, otherwise I won't see the good at the end. Checkmate. - [Harvey] Huh. Ponce de Leon, first European to explore Puerto Rico. - (sighs) Why didn't you get married, Harvey? - Oh, there was one proposition. - And you didn't take it? - (chuckling) I got you instead. - [Jimmy] (laughs) You should've gone with a girl. - (laughing) (background mid-tempo Rock music) - One day, Jimmy Davis, this will all be yours. - The American dream. - Hey, I didn't always live here. I spent some time in Weston. (dramatic instrumental music) Your move, Jimmy. - You following me? - Mind your own business. Where you puttin' the stuff I gave you? - I'm buying jewelry. The guy inside always gives me a dis-- - [Voiceover] Look. I'm about to come into some money. - [Voiceover] Look. I'm not falling for it. I'm my place, Neil. You told me you paid the rent. - But, honey, listen, this is big. This is big. - Stop stalking me. - Where you going? Amanda! (background mid-tempo Rock music) - What can I help you today... with? - [Amanda] You know me. It's always jewelry. - Right. Jewelry! Right, yes. We have jewelry. - Can I help you? - Yeah, I've got some stamps here I'd like you to take a look at. - Okay, let's see. - [Voiceover] I, um, actually found these in my attic when I was cleaning up. - Good collection. - [Jimmy] You like that one? - Mm-hmm. - Can, can I have a raisin? - (scoffs) I don't have a raisin. - What about a date? - [Amanda] I don't have a date either. - (chuckles). You've, you've heard that one before, huh? - [Amanda] Yeah. - [Harvey] Uh, uh, how much do you want for it? - Uh, I was thinking 4,500. - Oh, that's high. I don't see that here. - How much would you give me for 'em? - I'd give you, uh, 3,000. - Oh. - [Harvey] I'd like to look it over and, uh, then I'll get back to you. - Well, I'd kinda like to get it handled now. I'm in the process of moving. - I'll tell you what, um, I'll give you this one and I'll throw in this one, too, for, uh, for, for 20 bucks. - (clears throat) - [Amanda] Deal. - Okay. (laughs) - 3,000. - Deal. - So, uh, about that date. - I'll think on it, sweetie. Okay. - What about Amanda? - Who? - The girl that buys the jewelry. - [Harvey] She's cute. That's about all she's got goin' for her. - Maybe I just need to get to know her better. - [Harvey] Jimmy! (dramatic instrumental music) - [Voiceover] Yes, sir, it was an astonishing discovery. It has preliminarily secured by the prestigious Atrium auction house. Two other copies are known to exist. For a short time in 1868 the U.S. postal service issued the one cent Benjamin Franklin stamp with the Z-Grill security imprint on the back to prevent the cancel marks from being removed. One of these stamps was traded in 2005 for another book of stamps valued at three million dollars. This particular one is set to go at auction for four million. - What's going on? - Cut. - You the owner? - Uh, partner. Jimmy Davis. - Camera. How does it feel to be a millionaire? - Um, actually, the auction house has just given us a deposit. Harvey insists on verification before, but I'm sure it's, I'm sure it's the real deal. - What are you gonna do with all that money? - Um, it's not all mine. We'll probably just fix the place up a bit. - Cut. Can we talk to Harvey, too? - Um, I'll see. It takes him a minute to get together in the morning, so you can just stay here. - Come on, Irving. Uh, Harvey? Harvey? - [Patty] Back here! - Patty? (melancholy instrumental music) What's going on? - [Patty] (sniffling) (melancholy instrumental music) - He would want you to have this. (melancholy instrumental music) - Excuse me, um, could you bring me something that resembles edible food? - Okay. - Honey, I'm so sorry this happened to you. - Yeah, thanks. Harvey was the best. - He was really special to you, huh? - Yeah. Yeah. When I was 16 my parents sorta split and I started hanging out at the shop and Harvey took me in. That was like eight years ago. - How old was he? - 86. - Well, you'd think in 86 years, you know, he woulda found somebody he could've attached himself to. So, what's in your future? - Um, I don't know. I haven't really thought of a future without Harvey in it I guess. - Well, whatever I can do, sugar, you just let me know. - Thanks. - Maybe you should take a trip or something. You know? Fly to New York and see a show. - I don't fly. Or I don't plan on it, anyways I guess. And crowds kinda bother me anyways. - Well, here, honey, you think on that and I'm gonna go powder my nose. - [Jimmy] Okay. - [Amanda] I'll be right back. (background piano music) (buzzing) - Hey, Patty. Yeah, I appreciate that. I know, it's sorta weird. Harvey's gone and I'm on a date. Yep. What? Patty, hang on one sec, I'm losin' ya. Uh, hang on one second. Say that again. Really? We didn't think they'd advance that much money. (dramatic instrumental music) Hey, Patty, I'm gonna have to call you back. - [Amanda] You're done telling. - You aren't shakin' me off that easily. - She's in trouble. - [Amanda] You're right. I can't seem to shake you off no matter what I do. You just don't get it. Tell ya what. When this one runs outta money I'll look you up. - I'm in trouble. - [Amanda] 'Cause you better or I'll just say we're through for good. Stop stalking me, Neil! Come near me again and I'll drag you in for harassment. (rainfall) (thunder) (melancholy instrumental music) - [Harvey] My duty is to move the pieces, otherwise I won't see the good at the end. Your move, Jimmy. (melancholy instrumental music) - [Jimmy] Hey, Irving, how would you like a job? - A job? - [Jimmy] Yeah. Come work for me. (glass shattering) - [Irving] Deal. - Patty can show you everything. - They'll be a dissertation on how to operate a broom at three. What's up? - Patty, I'm taking a trip. - You're leaving? - I'm leaving, but not forever. I just need to get away for awhile. You can run this place with your eyes closed. - Your date's at the door. - What? - Jimmy. - [Jimmy] Okay, I'll let you guys know where I am in a couple days. Don't tell her. Irving? Okay? - [Irving] Uh, not a problem. - Okay. - [Patty] Go out the back. - Right. (slow tempo instrumental music) - Jimmy? - What? - Where to, son? - [Jimmy] Huh. - New Holland, Jasperville, Weston? - Weston. - [Voiceover] Weston it is. - Oh, okay. - [Voiceover] You better hurry, son, it's about to leave. - [Jimmy] Oh! Um, thank you. (mid-tempo instrumental music) (transitions to uptempo instrumental music) (transitions to slow tempo instrumental music) - This is down right homey, Harvey. (birds squawking) (background Big Band music) (violin chord) Hello? - [Voiceover] Well, why didn't ya say something? These blasted rolls keep me so busy every morning I sometimes forget I run a shop. Want one? - Oh, no, thank you. - Ever since the Wells boy went to the military I... You heard about that, didn't ya? Well, I'm a little short of help. What can I do for ya? - Do you still have the job? - [Voiceover] Oh. Well, maybe I do. Uh, where you from, son? - I just got off the bus. - [Voiceover] Oh. - I do have some experience. - [Voiceover] Really? - Yeah. Um, take this violin, for instance. Let's see. Okay, it was regraduated in 1904. I've heard that these still have a really great tone. - Yeah? - [Jimmy] Yeah. You could probably get about two to three thousand for this at auction. - Are you a con man? - (laughing) No. No, I'm serious. - Auction? - Right, well, an online auction. - [Voiceover] But I don't have a computer. - Sure you do, right over there. It's even got a fax printer. - [Voiceover] Uh, I don't have a big business. - Well, I can help with that. - Am I gonna like you? - Yes, ma'am. I'm very likeable. - Wanda Pike. - Jimmy Pawn. Pawn, Jimmy Pawn. - One prerequisite. - [Jimmy] Okay. - I gotta take your picture. (mid-tempo acoustic guitar music) Something wrong? - Oh, no. Just looking. Those smell amazing. Thank you. - You've got the prettiest eyes. We don't get very many new folks around here. I think you're gonna like it. I mean, I know I already like it a whole lot better. - Please! - Hey! What's wrong? (background uptempo Rock music) - Well, little lady, what can I get for you? - You have any taters? - [Voiceover] Well, name it, we got it. - A plate of shoes, pin some roses on it and top it with a moldy lid. - Can I help you? - Um, no, I was actually just seeing if, um, are you okay? - [Voiceover] What's your business here, son? - [Jimmy] Right. I work for Wanda down the street. But I was just seeing if she was okay. - [Voiceover] Thanks for stopping by. - Yeah. (phone notification) I sold the violin. Look, I got 3,000 for it. Here. This is yours. It's all square, I promise. (fax machine printing) It's just a fax. - Oh. I think it needs more bubbles. - What? - Needs more bubbles. - Oh. - Something interests you? - Do you know her? (buzzing) Irving, I told you to fax me. - [Irving] Patty's not here and I thought this was really big, they're little pointy-haired dolls. - Trolls. They're trolls. - Okay, okay. One of 'em has bright blue hair. I should buy them, right? - No. Just wait 'til Patty get there. - What do ya think? - [Wanda] Don't you feel stupid? - What? - Standing there, not knowing what to do. Take her some rolls. (mid-tempo acoustic guitar music) - Thanks. - You're welcome. Hi! Hey, do you wanna play? It's gonna get hot over there. It's actually pretty easy. So, have you ever played before? That's fine. The goal is to clear the way to the king and each piece has it's own specific move. You've got your pawn, your rook, your knight, your bishop, your queen and your king. And keep in mind that the pawn starts as the least powerful piece on the board, but it has the potential to become equal or more powerful. Does that make sense? Okay, so, I'll move my pawn to... (mid-tempo instrumental music) You don't talk a whole lot, do ya? And you're sure you've never played before? (chuckles) - Finding it hard to move? - [Jimmy] When the king is trapped in check it's called checkmate. Like this. I'm sorry. Hey, you weren't the only one who got off that bus. Stupid. (background Big Band music) - 98 cents is your change. Thanks. - Thank you. - Can I help you guys? Hey. - [Voiceover] I've got some jewelry to sell. - Okay. (background Big Band music) - Wow. I can give you 300 for this. - Okay. - But you have to tell me your name first. Uh, it's okay, just, just give me a second. (background Big Band music) Here you go. $300. - Thank you. - What about that? (gentle instrumental music) Wow. These are really old. - It's Lindsey. - Jimmy Pawn. Honestly, I'd have to do some research to give you a price on these. Do you mind if I take a picture? - No, I don't mind. (upbeat Rock music) - [Voiceover] You savin'? Well, how 'bout a free cup of coffee? - I need a job. - Well, I can't make a living if I hire more. I'll tell you what, I could use somebody to clean up at the end of the night. I'd be willing to trade whatever's left over in the food area for the work. - Food sounds great, thank you. - [Patty] That one's worth more if we leave it dirty. If you need me I'll be out back. - [Amanda] Hi, um, is Jimmy around? - No, he's not here. Can I help you? - Well, see, I'm his girlfriend and I got a new cell phone number and I'm sure he's been trying to call me. - He's got a cell phone. - [Amanda] I know. Right. But, see, I had his number in my old phone so, you know, the new one I just... Could I just get his number again? - I'm not supposed to give out information. - Well, how do you contact him? - He stays in contact. - Right. Can you show me something over there? Yep. A little higher. No, not right there. (smack) - Were you ever married, Wanda? - Never married. - How do you know when they're the one? - Well, for one, you don't stop thinking about 'em. (gentle acoustic guitar music) - What? - These will help you. I want you to read every bit of them. - [Voiceover] I told you, Wanda, to put those things away when I come. - [Wanda] You'll just ask for them anyway. - Got some help? - Jimmy, meet Sheriff Hansen. - Hey. - How do? - Jimmy just sold that old violin for $3,000. - [Sheriff Hansen] Say! I'm impressed. I read where a pawn shop made a killin' on a rare stamp. They said they made over 3 million. (background uptempo instrumental Country music) When are you gonna quit takin' in these strangers? - [Wanda] Hospitality is my gift, Hansen. - It truly is. - [Jimmy] Don't leave. - You wanna play? I just, I really miss my daily game with Harvey. - Go play with him then. - When Harvey took me in I didn't know really anything about the game. And I rarely beat him and when I did I'm pretty sure he let me win. He took in every kid with no place to stay. Most of 'em didn't last long, but I did. He was like the father I never had. - Why did you get off the bus? - Personal reasons. Harvey died. And then, there's this girl. What? - Did God move us off that bus? Or did we walk off ourselves? I believe my horsey found your king. - She's strange. - But you wanna talk again. - She did talk more this time. - Will you help me? - Does anyone in town sell camping equipment? - What? (upbeat acoustic guitar music) - [Voiceover] A 1963 Gibson Les Paul. - Pawn or sell? - Sell. I want 15 grand for it. - I don't think so. - Offer me something. - Uh, 1,500. - What?! - This is a 1975 Les Paul. See the band around the side? - You callin' me a liar? - No, you just don't have whatcha think you have, dude. Les Paul Customs stopped in 1963. - Learnin' something, huh? - Maybe you should keep that out. - [Patty] I told you, no personal information is given. - I just wanna talk to him. - He knew exactly what it was. - Nah, he couldn't have. - Why'd you send your girlfriend in there? - Girlfriend? Is she in there? - You're washed up in this town, Neil. - Hi. We just wanna do a little follow-up with our new millionaire. - I can call him and see, I guess. Uh, maybe not. - That's it. We're closed. Everybody out. I'm serious, let's go. - [Amanda} Wait! You guys up for a little adventure? (gentle instrumental music) - Whatcha got there? - Why are you being so nice to me? - I don't know what, I don't know what you're talking about. - [Jimmy] I-- - [Lindsey] I saw your tracks at my campsite. - Okay. Uh, it's like this, I was just trying to make a move. Oh, no, no, no. Not that kind of move. (laughs) Well, I mean, maybe. Sort of. But not really. - Mm-hmm. When will that be? - Good morning, Irving. - Mm-hmm. - Look at you! - Uh-huh. - My, my, my. - Mm-hmm. - The professional pawn man. - Mm-hmm. - They can't hear your head nod, Irving. - [Irving] Right. Right. Okay, bye. - [Patty] What's up? - The auction house, one of the appraisers thinks the stamp's a fake and the other isn't sure. - That would be bad. Let's wait to call Jimmy, 'til we're for sure. (gentle instrumental music) - Anything on my earrings? - Not yet. - Do you wanna play a game? (gentle instrumental music) - [Jimmy] So, your question about whether it was God that moved us off that bus or not, I believe it was. (gentle instrumental music) - Guess there's no more moves to make. Checkmate. - How do you do that? - Ask God. - Coming from someone that owns such a large bible I'm surprised to hear you say that. Seems like you still have moves to make. - What about Jimmy Pawn? Where you movin' to? - I'm just trying to move towards the goodness of God. (dramatic instrumental music) - Got it. (dramatic instrumental music) Got it. Got it, (mumbling). Hurry up! (dramatic instrumental music) (phone ringing) - Hello? - [Jimmy] Yeah, I'm calling for a Baracaldo. - [Baracaldo] Speaking. - Well, yes, sir, I'm calling about the earrings you're looking for. Uh, I have clients looking for pieces like this all the time and I was just wondering if you found them or if they're for sale. - Who is this? - Uh, I'm just lookin' to get more information about the item. Uh, it's a gold base, right? - [Baracaldo] Yes, that's true, but they haven't been found yet. My son gave them to his ex-fiance and, well, you know how that goes. Have you seen them? - I saw your poster online, that's too bad, I coulda sold 'em for ya. [Baracaldo] - Who are you? - I'm a historical investor. Um, Maxwell Jewelry 1940's, right? - That's right. There's a reward for them you know? - Hmm. I coulda offered you, um, 28 grand. - What'd you say your name was? - Um. - Hello? (buzzing) - Oh. Ah. Block. That was stupid. I sold the earrings. - Really? How much? I never seen the sight. How much is it? - 3,500. - Say that again. - 3,500? - I could, I could... - Rent out Wanda's other apartment. (upbeat acoustic guitar music) I've got one just as old. - It was my pop's. Left it to me when he died. - And your mother? - She died when I was born. - Oh. - I lost pop in January. The weddin' was supposed to be in March. We owned a diner. Best potatoes in town. Pop sold it to the rich man and his son. They're makin' their big franchise out of it. - His son. So, he was the one. - I got lost in the deal. - I'm sorry. - Don't be, I learned my lesson. What? - You could use a cover for that, to preserve it. - You've done enough. - It means a lot to you, I'd like to do it. - Okay. - You going hunting? - Yep. I saw a mouse this morning. No, no, not in my house. - I ordered some covers for these, they should be in today. - You goin' somewhere? - You think I could have the day off? - Sure. - (laughing) Okay. Thanks, I'll be back. (dramatic instrumental music) - So intense. - Don't think you can distract me. - I already know you've beat me. - (laughing) - What do you like? What do you like? - I like the woods, our houses in the woods. You can hear the creek in the morning, the birds. Hmm, let's see. Children. I like children. - I love kids. - A kid is a goat, Jimmy Pawn. - (laughing) Oh, I see. Pardon me. - What about you? - Um, I like history. Old junk, um, bein' part of a family. - What don't you like? - Dancing. - (laughing) - [Jimmy] (laughing) Harvey was a tap dancer, so he'd try to teach me some moves but he gave up. - [Lindsey] (laughing) - I think he saw it wasn't my gift. What don't you like? - Sauerkraut. And rich people. Checkmate.

("Strange Weather" - by Lexie Hofer) It's an old tobacco barn. Reminds me of where our community held their dances. Come on, Jimmy Pawn, time to dance. - I really can't dance. - Please. (gentle instrumental acoustic guitar music) - I can do this. - [Lindsey] - (laughs) (gentle instrumental acoustic guitar music) Sorry. - Yes. It's gettin' pretty late, huh? - [Wanda] Oh, dear. What's wrong? - I barely even know her. How can I be sure that this is the move and not just a move. - [Wanda] Providence has a plan, Jimmy. You just have to keep movin'. - [Baracaldo] Hi. I was wondering if you might be able to help me with something. - Maybe. - [Baracaldo] I'm looking for this girl. - Sorry, can't help ya. (buzzing) - Did I ever tell you about how I fell in love with a tap dancer? - No. - [Wanda] He enlisted and marrying him before he left was out of the question. I was too young. He wrote and told me that they ran out of boots, but he wore those tap shoes with pride at every drill. I saved every dime I had to buy those shoes. - What happened? - It wasn't meant to be. (gentle instrumental piano music) You can't run, Jimmy, you can only move. Look at all those people. Jesus brought them here. Just like he brought you. The good Lord has seen fit to bring Harvey back to me in a very special way. Smile. You deserve two pictures in my album. (buzzing) - Hey, Irving, what's up? - How'd you get the money so fast? - Actually I'm gonna have to call you back. What? - The banks weren't open yet. - Uh, I had the cash. - I thought you were different. - Lindsey, come on. Come on! - Can I help ya? - [Amanda] No, I don't think you're getting the picture. Let me start over. See, I'm his girlfriend, so, I know he's here. - Um, would you like a roll? The fresh ones are over here. (background instrumental Bluegrass music) Brown hair, 5' 8", con artist. Hmm. Find anything? - Not today, thank you. (background instrumental Bluegrass music) - Sheriff Hansen. - Lindsey. - Look, mister, don't touch her. - The name's Baracaldo and she has something of mine. Like my jewelry. - Remember our new millionaire from the pawn shop? - I sold it. Like you don't know. - He doesn't know. - It wasn't yours, Lindsey. - He gave it to me. - He didn't have the right to do that. - We've tracked him down here in Weston and yes, he's working at the local pawn shop. Wanda's Pawn and Trading Post. Get a shot of that sign. Word has it-- - Come on, honey, we don't need to put up with all this. - Who's she? - No one. - I'm his girl. - No, you're not! - [Voiceover] What's going on here? - Look, I just need the earrings, okay? - I told you, I sold them. - To whom? - But as you can see behind me the small town life may not like their new millionaire. (buzzing) Irving. - [Baracaldo] It's not Irving. Where is it? - Wait a minute, millionaire? - Yeah. Yeah, that's what I was trying to tell you. I bought the earrings. I'm the millionaire. - Apparently the scuffle is about money. - You can't buy me. - I was trying to bless you. - But what he doesn't realize is that the auction house authorities have claimed the rare stamp to be a fake. - I think I just saw this guy. - [Voiceover] The counterfeit scheme seems to be the work of Neil Sharp, a notorious forger still at large. - What's goin' on? - He's sitting in a car by the shop. - Let's see if we can get some response from our pawn master. - Looks like I'm not a millionaire anyway. (slow-tempo Rock music) Yeah, it's okay, Irving. Even Harvey thought it was real. Alright, I'll talk to you tomorrow. Okay, bye. (knocking) Come in. You woulda been proud of Harvey. - Seeing you I still am. Your name's in there. - I already saw it. - So, your goodness in the end was me. Some mess I've made of it. - [Wanda] Jimmy, how do you see this ending? - What do you want? - Is Lindsey here? - [Voiceover] No. Do you know where she is? She bought a ticket for tomorrow's bus. Will you give this to her? Please. - Sure. (gentle instrumental music) (transitions to uptempo instrumental music) - I'm really sorry, Wanda, but I've gotta run. Oh, here, let me grab that. - Oh, no, I've got it! Go on! - [Jimmy] Okay, okay, just, just keep your computer running and I'll send you a forwarding address, okay? - [Wanda] Oh, now go on with ya. (melancholy instrumental music) - Don't think this is gonna get you a reward. - This move doesn't need repayment. (melancholy instrumental music) - [Jimmy] Keep in mind that the pawn starts as the least powerful piece on the board, but has the potential to be equal or more powerful. - Jimmy Pawn. - I'm about to capture a queen.
