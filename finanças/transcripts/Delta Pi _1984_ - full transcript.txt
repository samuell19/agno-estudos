(dramatic music) - [Woman] Hey guys, breakfast is almost ready! - Oh god, how can you talk of food, my mouth tastes like an ashtray. - Morning fellow paupers. - Guess we didn't make too much money last night, huh? - Are you kidding, after Benzhadi took his cut, we made $166. That won't even pay our phone bill this month. Our major should be deficit finances. - Well like they say it's hard to mix pleasure and business. - Hey Jackie, your daddy's rich, what's the chance of him loaning the house some money? - About as much chance as we all have of graduating. - Well but it wouldn't be mad money, it's for our sorority survival. - And what makes you think my father wants to see Delta Pi survive? I mean, staying here is the reason I'm cut off. - Hello loverboy. - Good morning, how are things in never never land? - Oh incredible there's a whole universe right inside our heads. - That may be the only place we have to live when Benzhadi doesn't get our check in the mail. Look it, we've gotta make some money and real quick. - Check this out, mud wrestles needed, big bucks for pretty, sexy girls. Short hours, no experience necessary. International Classy promotions, ask for Shawn or Lane. - What a great idea. - A mud wrestler, now wouldn't that just blow my old daddy's status conscious mind? (laughs) That'll teach him to cut off his little girl. - Monica, I don't know how you talked me into joining this sorority, some best friend. - Oh come on, Karen, where's your old Delta Pi spirit? - I just wanna find a good man to marry. - Why this could be the beginning of the new Delta Pi. We'll put on our own show and instead of using mud we use whipped cream or something like that. (girls holler) And we'll call it the fantasy wrestlers. - Oh no. - God the frats will love it. - Oh what about our house mother? - You're right, Mugs has been getting crazy lately. We've gotta find a way to get her out of the house. - Fix her a couple martinis, that oughta handle it. (laughs) - Yeah, she's still out cold somewhere from last night's soiree. (girls laugh) - That's not nice. Well let's take her to the movies, she likes the movies. - Oh what's the difference she never remembers anything she sees anyway. - Monica, get serious, there's only six of us, how are we going to organize everything in time? - Oh come on old pal, we are a bunch of resourceful girls. - Desperate is more like it. - I might have been a little bombed last night but I oh yeah I sure remember that one of you little ladies oh yes, you're some kind of wildcat. (girls laugh) - I swear to god. - You sure you weren't smoking one of Magic's funny cigarettes? - Ooh maybe found one of my mouse traps.

You guys need a team a lot more than we need you. - Hey come on the one thing tinsel town is full of is pretty girls, honey. - And hustlers. Like I said what do we need you for? - 'Cause we're the ones that have the deal with the promoter. - And there are a lot of hustlers that had deals with the boys in Vegas that are now just apart of the Nevada highway. (laughs) - Okay who's turn is it? - Okay, all right, 60/40, that's my final offer. (dramatic music) - Okay hot shot. (dramatic music) (girls scream and cheer) (upbeat music) - Think fast, you really invented all this stuff Lame? - It's Lane, not Lame. - Oh sorry, slick machine anyway. - Yeah, but what you really need back here is one of those vibrating shower heads. - What kind of a field trip are we going on?

(hollers) - Go around, go around. (girls holler) - Hey who are those guys? - I told you the promoter is gonna replace us. - Hey come on Lane speed up man, don't let those guys pass us. - I'm an inventor not a miracle worker. - What's going on, I thought you hustlers already had the deal. (girls holler) - Get the hell out the way, get the hell out of way, get the hell out the way. (girls holler) (dramatic music) (tires squeal) - So long suckers. (horn blows) (dramatic music) (girls holler) (horn blows) - Oh this is bullshit. - What kind of game are you two playing? - Look I don't know what's going on either. We got no reason to lie to you. There's no way we're gonna dig this out in time. - Whoever that guy is he's trying to move in on our deal. Oh Shawn I'm always a day late and a dollar short. - Hey. Hey does that thing you built really fly? - Well, according to my calculations it might. - Are you crazy, that things nothing but a pile of scrap. - Hey partner, you sure you don't want me to go?

I was just worried you guys would replace us. - Cupcake and I were just talking. Fast talking kid like you could pick up a team anywhere. - Hey my word is good. You don't know how much this means to these girls. I mean, they've been training like crazy. They even fought a warm up match at the university they attend. - Hey this oughta be a hell of a match, Cupcake. I see here where your competition has just arrived. The Nevada Nasties, (laughs) would you like to say hello to them. - Nevada Nasties, huh? - And they're real sore losers. - Well I'm sure the girls will be just thrilled. - Just understand one thing kid, this is my show, don't get funny.

Laurie can't keep her hands to herself. And we have to carry Mugs and Lane to their rooms. - So we celebrated a little bit too much, it's our first night in Vegas. - Look I know better than to ask you to start getting the girls to start training, but how about you just keep them out of trouble for awhile, huh? I mean, the promoters do not have a good sense of humor here. - Hey neither do I, we were told all the arrangements were made when we left LA. - Well they were. The team that sideswiped us today is the team we have to fight. - You mean, I've got to fight those queen cons. - You guys are real gems, you didn't tell us we were gonna be freak fighting. - I saw the other team for the first time today too you know. I mean, quit treating me like I'm some mercenary of something would you? - Jeeze, he's even more high strung than you Karen. (dramatic music) - Boy I feel lucky tonight, did you feel the electricity in the casino? - Yeah, and I saw some cute cowboys with some big wads.

They've never been to Las Vegas. - Well why don't you tell the Maxim Hotel that. They're just about ready to cancel my whole event. You know kid, you're lucky as hell with this sorority thing, it's got us a lot of press. - You know that's right. I heard the vetters are picking us as the favorites. - Oh well I did drop the word that you were wringers from LA. (laughs) Hey kid, come on, you and I both know, you ain't got snowball's chance in hell. (laughs) - What do you mean? - Well I've decided I'm gonna give you kids a $5,000 consolation prize. Now you just have the girls put on a good show and then go happily home with their second place ribbons. - You're asking me to throw the fight. - I'm not asking, look kid, I'm betting your $5,000 on the Nevada Nasties at three to one. That is 15 big ones, think about it. - That wasn't our deal, you don't understand those girls trusted me. - I don't give a shit about all this competition angle. Hey kid take a look out there, that is Las Vegas, not Madison Square Garden. I'm a promoter, I'm a gambler, everybody knows wrestling is fixed. Think about it kid. (slow dramatic music) - Look you guys $15,000 bucks for coasting your way for an all expense paid trip to Las Vegas is not that bad. - Yeah, our share would be $9,000, we could square things up with Benzhadi and prepay our rent for the next six months. - What they're asking us to do is throw the fight. - Yeah and to a bunch of real douche bags. - Those sons of bitches, a swift kick in the ass is what they need, what fight? - Are you all crazy, those other girls are animals, I bet they feed them raw meat for breakfast. - No. - We came here to win, if we lose to the hotel they'll never know the difference anyway. And we still collect the $15,000. If we win, they have to pay us. The hotel couldn't stand the bad press of welching on a bunch of sorority girls. - Oh my god, we're gonna sprouting cactus in the middle of the desert. - Don't you see with our cut of $100,000, we could easily pay off Benzhadi and maybe even put a down payment on our house. - All right, no more first of the month blues. - Delta Pi owning it's own house. - Let's go for it, whatever it is!

All you guys care about is padding your own pockets. - Look I understand how you feel, but you're wrong, Lane and I have our last dime riding on this thing. - Our landlord is preparing our eviction notice right now. And there's probably some Iranian loan shark putting out a reward on us all. - What happened to all the money you girls made? - We still came up 1,000 short. So I thought I'd try my luck at the tables. - Listen, there'll be plenty of time for that after the fight. Besides even if we don't win we still make a bundle. - You really do care what happens to us don't you? - I do. Hey we're partners now right?
