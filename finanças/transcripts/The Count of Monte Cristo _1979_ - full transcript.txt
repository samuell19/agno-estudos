Abbé Busoni had asked to use my library without disturbing and about midnight he heard noises in the hall. He went upstairs with Ali, my servant I left here just in case. The Campos Elísios district attracts bandits... Your customers, Mr. Attorney. Clients I couldn't do without, Mr. Count. - They keep him alive. - And next? Then our thief, who thought his house was empty, came out as he came in. And when he came down on the other side of the wall, the accomplice he was watching murdered him. Abbé Busoni heard his screams, ran into the street accompanied by Ali and they brought him here. but he was a dying man that the Abbé let die. It's the stuff he dropped. It looks surprising. This Caderousse's waistcoat is missing. Why do you think he wore a vest? The blade that hit him three times left him in the wounds threads of a brown fabric different from the color of the shirt. He's a good detective, Mr. Attorney. But does the Abbé's statement mention the presence of the vest? No, precisely. I was going to ask Abbé Busoni about this, but the servant told me he went to Lyon to look after a sick relative. He expects to stay there for fifteen days. So patience. "I die murdered by Corso Benedetto," "my fellow in fetter in Toulon" "with the number 59." I don't understand well. Minister, tell me something. When Morcerf went to Greece, wasn't he already a general? No, Mr. Duke. It was just Colonel Fernand Mondego. But he already held the title of Earl of Morcerf. - Who promoted you to general? - Janina's pasha, Ali-Tebelin. gentlemen, Mr. Marquis de Bagville asks to speak. gentlemen, I have to tell you something extremely serious and that could be painfully reflected in honor of our illustrious assembly. I therefore ask for your full attention. The newspaper Impartial wrote three weeks ago about a French officer in the service of Ali-Tebelin, pasha of Janina, who not only delivered the citadel of Janina, but he also sold his benefactor to the Turks. The name of this officer at the time was Fernand, as our distinguished colleague said. But the Impartial forgot, perhaps out of discretion, to add to this proper name a title of nobility and the name of a land. We are in a position to reveal that it is Mr. Earl of Morcerf, member of the House of Peers. The honor of Mr. Morcerf is also the honor of this House. To put an end to this scandal, I ask that an investigation be carried out as fast as possible, in order to undo the slander before it grows and restore the reputation and dignity of Mr. of Morcerf. The word is Mr. of Morcerf. gentlemen, I'm a soldier and I'd rather spill my blood to prove to my honorable colleagues that I am worthy to sit among them. I have documents here that prove that Janina's pasha honored me with his trust. I can even say with your affection until the hour of your death, for he had entrusted me with a crucial negotiation with the sultan. But unfortunately the sultan made fun of me and when I returned to Janina, Ali-Tebelin, my protector, teacher and friend he had already succumbed to an assassin's dagger. I could only save the pasha's favorite wife and his daughter from death. What became of those two princesses, Count? Bad luck followed me, Mr. President. On the day when he was to embark with them for France, were kidnapped and I never knew what happened to the princesses. Can you provide evidence to support your claims? The best proof I can present is precisely the total absence of testimonies or any testimony that calls into question my word as a soldier and gentleman. Mr. Count, we have a testimony of considerable importance, judging by the note that has just been handed to me. Bring in the person who wishes to testify before the Chamber. The message you were kind enough to send me claims he was an eyewitness Janina's tragic events. I was, in fact, although very young at the time. So, allow me to ask you what your name is. I am Princess Haydée, daughter of Ali-Tebelin, pasha of Janina and his beloved wife Princess Vasiliki. This is the deed of the sale of my person and that of my poor mother. She died, couldn't survive the dishonor. The man who sold it to us is the same French officer who, after betraying my father, set aside as part of his loot the wife and daughter of your benefactor! Ma'am, what was this officer's name? It is in the scripture before you. His name was Fernand Mondego. It's a cabal! An abominable plot, hatched by my enemies, lords. It is abject and low politics. Look at the princess. Is it the daughter of Ali-Tebelin Basha or not? You don't recognize me. For I recognize you, murderer Fernand Mondego! Peers, take a good look at the bastard sitting next to you. He's got my father's blood on his hands. Count de Morcerf, do you want a new inquiry? I can ask two of us to go to Janina. Speak. What decides? Nothing, Mr Chancellor. Anything. No doubt. Danglars only materialized the operation. It was the Count of Monte-Cristo who instigated the plot. Danglars is a capitalist. Bankers generally don't like to duel. Mr. Count of Monte-Cristo is also not fond of but if it hits, I'm afraid it does it too well. He hits an ace of spades 30 paces away. The best I can do today is be killed in my father's defense. Good night Sir. of Morcerf. How are you doing? I didn't come here to exchange banal courtesies, Mr. Count, but to demand that you give me an explanation. An explanation in the opera? He was wrong on the spot. We're not at the Porte de Saint-Martin or around there. When it's a matter of honor, you don't choose a place to settle disputes. disputes? Are you okay? Well enough to recognize the ambush of betrayal and challenge him to a duel! You, sir, moderate your tone even if it is to provoke. Noise doesn't sit well with everyone, Mr. of Morcerf. I consider your glove released, sir. So I'm returning it wrapped in a pistol bullet. And now, is it necessary for my servant to make him leave? What did you do to the viscount? To him, absolutely nothing. Interest. And what will you do? I will kill him, of course. There's a lady here, sir. She insists that she wishes to speak with Mr. Count. Who are you? Edmond... Don't kill my son. What name did you pronounce, Mrs. of Morcerf? It's not Mrs. de Morcerf here it is, Edmond. She is Mercedès. Mercedès is dead! I don't know anyone else by that name. I recognized you as soon as I saw you just by your voice. Spare my son. He has publicly insulted me. He deems you responsible for the terrible misfortune that befell his father. It is Providence. It is the hand of God punishing the fisherman Fernand Mondego, married to the Catalan Mercédès. The only culprit is... ...she is the one who did not wait for the return of the man she loved. Do you know why I was arrested? 'Cause a bastard called Danglars wrote a letter that another scoundrel, named Fernand Mondego, handed over to the royal prosecutor. The same one who deserted by the British. The same one who betrayed his brothers in Spain. the same that sold and put to death his benefactor Ali-Tebelin. forgive Forgive at least thinking of me, that I never stopped loving you. You know, Mercédès, what it's like to agonize slowly plunged into darkness? Do you know what it's like to rot in a prison dump for 7814 days? 187 thousand 356 hours? Do not. I only see the man I love about to become my son's killer. Take revenge on Fernand. Take revenge even on me. Take revenge on the guilty and not on the innocent. Then... what do you want? Do you want your son to stay alive? He will live. Thanks. Thank you, Edmond. I'm glad to recognize you... ... so... ... as good as I dreamed. Now, thou shalt not beat thyself. I will knock... ...once he publicly outraged me. It's what he wants. I will be killed. There is a God above us. Since you are alive, Edmund, I'm sure he will intervene. He is good and merciful. He can't want you dead. If my eyes don't shine now and if my beauty has withered, My love is present and alive within me. My love will give me strength to act. Goodbye. Thank you for agreeing to be my witness. I know few people in Paris. It is an honor and a duty, sir. My friend Morrel spoke of you with great ardor and heart. Heart is something you certainly don't lack. Ali took my will to the notary this morning. If I die, Maximilien will take notice of it. Die, sir? It was fun... The Viscount de Morcerf has not arrived? He sent word to us that he would be here. So let's wait. Mr. Conde waives the right to use his pistols. We anticipated this delicacy. We brought in entirely new weapons. Do you want to examine them? Your word is enough for me, Mr. Beauchamp. Albert left me a note asking to join you. I understand. As he witnessed the provocation, he wants you to attend the reparation. He's two minutes late. What does that mean? He has the imprudence to come on horseback and gallop to beat himself up with a pistol. He will shake his hand. However, he recommended that he relax before the meeting. Strange costume, by the way. Better to have a target drawn on the belly. Thank you for coming, gentlemen. You too, Morrel. The more honorable men present, the more satisfied I am. I have to speak to Mr. Count of Monte Cristo in front of everyone. Gentlemen, I hope none of what I'm going to say to Mr. Count of Monte Cristo get lost for they must repeat it to whoever will listen. Mr. Count, I beg you to forgive me. My Lord, no matter how guilty my father was, it did not seem to me that it was the right of the Count of Monte-Cristo to punish him. It didn't concern him. They just revealed the betrayal to me. Yes sir. The betrayal of Fernand Mondego of which you were the victim. And what an incredible disgrace this disloyalty caused him. So I say it out loud that he was right to take revenge. And he could have done it even more cruelly. Otherwise, I beg you... Since friendship is now forbidden to us, let us at least save the esteem we have for each other. I did what my conscience commanded, gentlemen. If anyone is mistaken as to the meaning of my attitude, if you attribute it to another feeling, let me know that I'm ready to face anyone. Thanks again. Mr. Count of Morcerf. It's Mr. Count of Morcerf! He thought he had heard wrong. Did he meet my son with sword or pistol raised? Yes. Without killing each other, imagine. So, did you apologize to him? No, it was he who asked for it because he was convinced that there was someone more to blame in this case than I was. Someone more to blame than you? Who? - The Lord. - I? Then you are crazy and my son is a coward. - Don't you have anything else to say to me? - Have. I have to tell you that he has no enemies who hate him more than I do. It's reciprocal. If young people refuse to fight, let's face each other in a duel. As you prefer, Mr. of Morcerf. So let's fight! We don't need to go looking for witnesses to kill ourselves, Mr. Count. Does not agree? I have only one name to pronounce to fulminate you. do you remember the man that you pushed into the abyss to steal his Mercédès? My fiancée. Edmond Dantès? Two. Reflect, my mother. I have friends in Paris. I can ask them to help. No, Albert. I can only accept the 150 louis d'or from the Count of Monte-Cristo. - Buried in the Marseille garden? - Yea. It's the sum Edmond put together with sacrifice so we can get married. I accepted because it was my dowry. Otherwise, nothing more. Come, this is no longer our home. A little slower please, sir. If Mr. Noirtier called, it's urgent, my friend. May I say, grandfather? Maximilien, my grandfather wants to leave this damn house. In case Mr. de Villefort will allow me, I will live with him. Otherwise, I wait 18 months to come of age and I will keep my promise to be your wife. Thank you, Valentine. Thank you also sir. I swear I'll make your granddaughter happy. My grandfather is convinced and so am I. Hot, my good Barrois? Mr. Morrel made me run, miss. You must be dying of thirst. Do you want a glass of lemonade? With pleasure. Thanks. It's the doctor ringing the bell. You have to go, Maximilien. Remember my grandfather's recommendation. Don't do anything that can hinder our happiness. I promise you again, sir. But can I visit once in a while? Get out there. Goodbye. Barrois, are you reeling? My God, I can't see. Dr. Avrigny, come quickly! Bring me water at once, ether, Vomit Inducer and Turpentine Essence. - Was it you who screamed? - Barrois is in bad shape, my father. He doesn't suffer, my friend. Everywhere, doctor... ... dreadful cramps. I drank the lemonade... This one? Yea! Who made this lemonade? It was me. And it was you who brought her here? Do not. It was the lady. - I suffocate. - Calm. His suffering will end soon. I know. Tell me... Can you get me violet syrup? Right now. This lemonade contains false angustura and Saint Ignatius bean. Withering poisons that leave no trace, except that if we add violet syrup, this lemonade takes on a green color. It's the same poison that killed Mrs. of Saint-Méran. And it's the same substance that just murdered poor Barrois. Crime is in my house again. Yes sir Attorney. You have it in your house and maybe in the person of a relative a terrible criminal of the kind that exist in all the centuries from Locusta to Brinvilliers. This is impossible. What evidence does he present for such an accusation? A terrible suspicion. As well? Speak. I knew it was Mr. Noirtier, who should have died but the killer didn't know that I've been treating him for a year with brucina? So his father is immune. Who could want to end my father's life? The killer knew that Mr. Noirtier destroyed a first will, which he made another, for the benefit of his daughter for not marrying d'Épinay. Then he attacks him, afraid he will make a third. The doctor is crazy. He looks for those who benefit from the crime. He's rambling. Unfortunately, I'm not. I accuse Ms. from Villefort. My daughter! It's impossible. I don't tolerate crime in my house. I can't stand it, do you hear? I don't tolerate crimes under my roof. Mr. de Villefort is a magistrate. I am a doctor. I can share this horrible secret with you, which in this case is a professional secret. But from now on, if anything happens in your house, including yourself, do not send for me. I will not be back. When credits start slipping out of a banker's hand his bench becomes a corpse and that's what happened to me. Is it bankruptcy? I don't abhor bankruptcies as long as they make me rich. Which is not the case. But you, Eugénie, can save me. As well? By marrying you, Mr. Cavalcanti brings you a dowry of 5 million that he puts in my bank. Eugénie, marry the prince. Become a princess, which is not to be despised, and my credit is saved. That is, pawn me for 5 million. The greater the sum, the greater the flattery. If I agree, will I be able to freely dispose of myself? You have my word. Very good. I will marry Mr. Cavalcanti. Thank God I escaped marrying Albert de Morcerf. I avoided being the wife of a coward who dishonored himself by refusing to fight and the daughter-in-law of a suicide. - We got away just fine. - Yea. What's up, my dear? You are pale. In fact, Valentine even now had blood on his face. Yes, it has been like this for a few days now. Fever is followed, for a moment, by a strange pallor. Withdraw if you like, Valentine. Yes ma'am. Drink a full glass of fresh water to invigorate you. I don't know what's been going on with this girl lately, but I admit it worries me. - Valentine! My God! - Clumsy. Now I'm always losing my balance. She runs to get Dr. Avrigny. Quickly. Doctor, hurry to my damn house. A new patient, Mr. Royal Attorney? No, it's my daughter. Poisoned like the others. She's the one you suspect. This is hideous. This time I will know who the killer is. I swear I will crush you. Let's try to save the victim. Then we think about the rest. Want to join that abominable family? Do you want to marry this young woman scarred by death? But I love her and I want to ask her how I can save her. Come and ask me to save the daughter of the one who... Be strong. Have hope. I watch for you. Can anything against death? Is she more than a man? I can do a lot, my friend. Much. Have courage and confidence. Goodbye, doctor. Hello. Tell me, are the owners moving? I don't know what happened, they suddenly decided this morning. In less than two hours they had packed their bags. And did anyone stay with the house? It's him. An Italian priest. Abbe Busoni. - Italian? - Because. Mr. Count of Monte Cristo. Mr. Count, thank you for accepting our invitation. It's a great honor. The signing of a marriage contract has always moved me a lot. You can see that you never signed yours, Mr. Count. No doubt. - The health of Ms. from Villefort? - Always delicate, unfortunately. That sad. It's a treat for the eyes, miss. My congratulations. - How lucky is the prince. - Thank you, Mr. Count. What a nice welcome, Baron. How can you display such pomp with such refined taste? It's a matter of price, my dear. I'd like to introduce you to some friends of mine. Eminent men. The notary! My friends, let's sign the contract. My husband will not be able to attend the ceremony. Unfortunately, Mr. de Villefort will not come. And we are counting on having that honor! Any impediment? An unforeseen incident concerning the murder case at the home of Mr. Count. I am afraid I have unwittingly caused Mr. Royal Attorney. Do you know that Abbé Busoni took the unfortunate man to my house when he was dying? To his house? Yes, the accomplice stabbed him on the Avenida dos Campos Elísios. Well, he was a fugitive named Caderousse, if I remember correctly. His memory is more faithful than mine, dear Baron. To treat that Caderousse, Abbé Busoni and my servant they undressed him from the waist up. Mr. Royal Prosecutor informed me of the absence of a vest in the clothes delivered to justice. And we found the vest this morning behind a desk where it had slipped. He was bloodied and punctured in the heart area. When searching it, my valet felt a paper in his pocket. It was a letter. Addressed to whom? - Addressed to you, dear Baron. - To me? But and this discovery prevents Mr. from Villefort to come? This letter and the vest are what's called "material evidence" in court, ma'am. I sent them to Mr. Attorney, who then discovered crucial details about the case. Of course, it did well. Anyway, we're here to marry two young people. Would you like to proceed with the reading of the contract. Mr. Prince Cavalcanti? Mr. Is Prince Cavalcanti here? Prince? Andrea? Where did you hide? But where is he? Which of you is called Andrea Cavalcanti? It looks like he is no longer here. Who is Mr. Cavalcanti? An escapee from Toulon Prison, miss. His real name is Benedetto. It was he who murdered in the Champs Elysees a man named Caderousse, who tried to rob Mr. Count of Monte Cristo. It's time for your potion, miss. And now sleep well. To have more nightmares? Let go of it. Now I say goodbye until tomorrow morning, miss. You can drink. Don't be afraid. He who sees before him is the most tender of parents and the most respectful of your friends. I've been watching over you for four nights. Yes, I protect you. I keep it for our dear Maximilien. Maximilien? - Did he tell you everything? - Yea. He told me that he loves her, that he is everything to him. And since then I've been watching what goes on in this room. How? I hide behind that door, facing the adjoining house, which I rented. I saw the people who visited her, the food they served, the drinks they prepare for you. I replaced the poison they administer to you every day for a beneficial drink that makes her live instead of making her die. A poison? Yes. I saw it being poured into your cup. By whom? For who killed your ill-fated grandmother and poor Barrois. It's not impossible. Believe me, Valentine. - I swear to God. - You're blaspheming. Unfortunately not. To give you proof of this abomination, I will retire. But Valentine... ... keep awake, I beg you. Don't make a gesture, hold your breath well and she will see with her own eyes who wanted to take his life. It's ringing at midnight. See you soon. I come back. Valentine. Valentine? And then? Recognized? My God... I can't believe it. Is it for poor Édouard that she committed all her crimes? Yes, Valentine. Now she understood. My God... What do I have to do? I want to live. By my grandfather. By Maximilien. She will have to obey me... ... blindly. Command and I will obey. So take this. We will. Whatever happens from now on, don't be afraid. If by chance you wake up plunged into the darkness of a tomb... - From a tomb? - Yea. ... remember that a man who only thinks about his happiness is watching over you. Valentine is my beloved daughter. Believe me just as you believe in Maximilien's love. She will be saved. Good morning, Miss. Today we are going to have a beautiful day. No horrible nightmares tonight. Miss? Help! Help! Sir! What is up? What is this screaming? My God! Was unable to save my beloved! - I only have to die. - Won't shoot. But who are you to claim such power? I am the man who has the right to order you to live. - In your father's name. - From my father? Why do you talk about him? Because I also saved your life on a day when, like you, I had lost all hope. Because your father's heart guessed the name of your savior, the same as it will be today, if you will, your savior. Are you Edmond Dantès? Yes. My dad... ... do you know who the killer is? Do you know that the Count of Monte-Cristo has enough faith in God to get miracles? And to give back life to the one I lost? It's the 5th of September and it's noon. Let's meet in a month, at the same time and on the same day. Or you will be cured... ... or I'll put the pistol in your hand myself. promise me? I don't promise you, I swear to you. - Is it really Master Bertuccio? - Yea. It didn't take long to get caught. You went down bad paths. Robbed and killed. I suppose you didn't come here to lecture me. It would fall on deaf ears. Who sent you? Was it your lord Monte-Cristo? Was. He's accused of murder. I know the scaffold awaits you but you have a helping hand within your reach. You can be saved. Hear me. Are you going to demand some head in court today? Without a doubt. Take. I think a little chocolate will give you the strength you need. It is the condemned man's last meal. Do you feel unwell? What have? Interestingly, quite the opposite. Didn't you pour the poison you usually serve into this cup? How? What are you saying? You murdered the Marquise de Saint-Méran, the unfortunate Barrois and then my daughter Valentine. Will you deny? Nor could it. It is no longer her husband who speaks to her. It's her judge. Who knows about your crime is me, my father and Dr. Avrigny. There are also those who are suspicious. It will soon be public. Listen... I beg you, my dear! I am no longer your darling. I have always noticed the incredible cowardice of poisoners. But I hope he kept for himself a more fulminating poison than the ones he gave his victims. I don't know what you're referring to. The wife of the first magistrate of Paris will not take the name of her husband and child to the scaffold. No... My God, not that! I'm in the world to punish, my lady. It's my sad job. But I leave the execution to you for I know that your knowledge is, unfortunately, unparalleled in this field. I ask you on behalf of our son... Mercy, I beg you! Let me live! In the name of my daughter killed by her hand, I swear that justice will be done. I'm going to the palace to demand the death penalty for a murderer. If on my return I find you here alive, I swear you will sleep in prison tonight. I hope I made myself understood. Goodbye, my lady. Goodbye forever. If the background of the defendant appearing in this court today they explain the crime but do not diminish the horror. If Benedetto's lineage is doubtful, Caesar's is, unfortunately, too remarkable. Evil is engraved in bloody, indelible letters from its origins and, I fear, seeing the feelings that animate him today before you, I fear that this evil is recorded for all eternity. Stand up the defendant. Say your first and last name. I have a request, sir. President. I would like to answer the questions that will be asked in a somewhat unusual order. First of all, I'm 21 years old. I was born on the night of the 27th to the 28th of September 1817. Can we know where he was born? Near Paris, Mr. President. In Auteuil. - Your profession? - I started out as a forger. Then I became a thief and a murderer recently. Forgiveness... I forgot one of my professions, Mr. Attorney. Outlaw convict. Does the defendant now consent to tell us his real name? I certainly wanted to give him greater nobility with the titles which it outrageously displays. It's extraordinary, read my mind. I don't know my real name. But I can tell you about my father. So say it and let's get this over with! My father is a royal attorney, Mr. President. His name is Gerard de Villefort. Silence! Silence, if I don't order the room to be evacuated! The defendant aggravates his case by mocking justice. God forbid I insult the court, Mr. President. I repeat, my father is Gerard de Villefort and I am ready to prove it. I was born in the red room of 28 rue de La Fontaine in Auteuil. My birth was, of course, illegitimate. My father swore to my mother that I had died at birth. She wrapped me in a swaddle with the initials H and N and buried me alive. If I stand before you today, I owe it to some kind of miracle. that allowed me to survive against my father's will. Can you prove these atrocious accusations? All evidence is available to the court, Mr. President. But it seems to me that it is enough to look at Mr. from Villefort. My father, I must report the details leading up to my birth and the events that followed it? Do not. No, it's useless. What do you mean, Mr. Attorney? The exams... ... are useless. So is everything the defendant just said true? I plead guilty Mr. President. And I put myself at the disposal of the new royal attorney, my successor. Gentlemen... It's done, sir. Just as he ordered. Édouard. Édouard. Mr. Abbe, what do you want? Say your debt is paid, sir. I will pray to God to stop this blow on you and yours. This voice... It is not the voice of Abbé Busoni. Monte Cristo? Not this one yet, sir. Look better. Mr. Attorney, further. Further. When he was a substitute in the time of King Louis XVIII. This voice... Where did I first hear it? In Marseille, February 25, 1815. Did I harm you in Marseille on the 25th of February...? But who are you? A ghost. A man you buried alive in the depths of the Château d'If and from whom you took love and freedom with one blow. Edmond Dantès! I'm recognizing you. There you have your revenge. Look. It's terrible. Our generation is having a good time this year. You are lucky, my dear Count, without a wife or children. Domestic heartbreaks are bearable for a millionaire. Yes it's true. I'm lucky to be rich. I was just signing five small titles. These are bearer bonds at the Bank of France. You who seem to juggle millions, have seen many pieces of paper like this worth a million each? Five million in all? What an embarrassment, Mr. Croesus! You have to see it to believe it. Will this sum be paid in cash at the Bank of France branch? He doubts? It is very curious, to be confirmed. I want to do the experience myself. The Lord... ...take my titles? My credit is six million a year. I raised 900,000 francs. 5 million and 100 thousand remain. I prepared the receipt for you, I need money today. Unexpected expenses. Excuse me, I owe the 5 million to the hospices, which claim me! That's different. Pay me in other amounts. I would be happy to proclaim to the world that House Danglars paid me five million in cash without batting an eyelash. Hold. A receipt from the Count of Monte-Cristo is cash. If you were in Rome, the Thompson & French House would pay him in cash immediately. POMEGRANATE To the London Hotel. Allegro! Do not move. Don't scream or you'll die. The Hotel Londres has changed a lot since my last trip to Rome. I warn Your Excellency that you are not here to play. Hey! Somebody! Good morning, my good man. I haven't eaten in 24 hours and I'm starving. Nothing easier. Your Excellency can have anything you want. - Do you have a kitchen? - It is clear! Do you think bandits feed on the air? Said I wasn't here to play. You're right. And what do you want, Your Excellency? I would love to eat a meaty chicken. A meaty chicken for His Excellency! Magnificent! Sorry, Your Excellency. Here you pay before you eat. It's fair. Here it is... ... a Louis. Keep the change. Sorry, Mr. Baron, Your Excellency still owes me 99,980 francs. It was fun. A chicken at a hundred thousand francs! Too much. Now let me eat. I'm waiting for the money, Your Excellency, or you won't eat. Bandit! I never hid my profession. Does your Excellency want something else? We're well stocked. - A piece of dry bread. - Nothing easier! We have excellent bread at a hundred thousand francs each, it's a friendly price. Do you want me to starve to death? Now, Your Excellency... In his pocket is a letter of credit from the Thompson & French House, in the amount of six million. If you sign me a bond of one hundred thousand francs I give him a golden chicken, well roasted over the coals. Another title and I give you bread. The best wine on the market is Valpolicella. 25,000 francs a bottle. And the bottle is one litre. I understand the situation, you scoundrel. His Excellency's Chicken! Captain! His Excellency calls for you. Did you call me, Your Excellency? Sir, I would like to know the value of the ransom you expect from me. It is evident, Your Excellency. The six million you bring with you. Six million for bed and board, of course. Take my life first! He whom we obey forbids us to shed his blood. - But who do you obey? - Someone who only obeys God. So get ready to eat for six million. It will be fast, you already know our prices. And when I run out of money, they let me starve to death. But you said you didn't want to kill me! It's not the same, Mr. Baron. MARSEILLE Unfortunately, I can no longer give you happiness. At least accept the consolation. My son became a soldier. He left for Africa. He is a noble heart. He will rebuild their future. His, yes. I asked God from the bottom of my heart may he never forsake you. But mine... So many things were broken in me, Edmond. I now feel close to the grave. I am the cause of all your ills. You must hate me. hate you? Hate you, Edmond? Look at me. Today you can bear the brightness of my eyes. I am no longer the Mercédès who ran to meet you smiling. I remember it was here, at your father's house. And despite everything, you spared me, Edmond. I was the biggest culprit of all. The others acted out of hatred, out of vanity. I was a coward. The others acted out of interest. It was fear that lost me. You never doubted God and God has not forsaken you. God was behind me, unknown, invisible, angry. I was your agent He didn't want to stop the lightning I had thrown. And I say it with pride, Mercédès, God needed me. That's why I lived. The revenge made me vindictive, underhanded, perverse, above all, impassive like cold fatality. I am tired. I'm the only one who recognized you. I'm the only one who understands you and admires you. No! Don't give me your hand, Edmond. I'm not worthy of it. Evil has dug a chasm between us. No, please. I beg you, my love. Please don't touch me anymore. Now say goodbye to me. I'll leave. I will have the memories. I take them with me. I will keep them until death. I don't want to miss them for the world. What do you want? I have nothing more to give you but I beg you to let me live. I don't even ask for freedom anymore, but a piece of bread. There are men who have suffered more than you. It's not impossible. Do you remember a young sailor you sent to a dungeon? even knowing him innocent? He was there 14 years. A young sailor? Yes. Do you remember an old man that you starved to death in Marseille 23 years ago, by depriving him of his son? Louis Dantès? Is it his ghost that appears to me every night? Do you at least regret it? Yes, how I regret it! I forgive you, because I myself need to be forgiven. Edmond Dantès! You were the most scoundrel of all and your life is saved, but my arm is too heavy. I believe that God himself you're telling me to abandon vengeance. Eats... Baby... Go away. But be careful, I condemn you... You who love gold so much, I condemn you to beg for your bread henceforth. If I know you've started working again, "doing business" as you called them, wherever you are, I will know how to reach you and crush you. Fades away before I drown in my heart the voice that tells me to let you live. Here it is. Here's what I promised you. Drink it. Farewell, my generous friend. I'll join the one I love... To find her, he threw himself to death. If necessary, he was given proof that he loves her more than life itself. Now they belong together. God bless these two lives I'm saving. Did I make you happy? Ask my dear sister. You found a sister, Haydée. That's great. Today you are free. I restore to you your father's name and all his riches. You are beautiful and young. Be happy. Forget me. I will obey you. Can't you see how she suffers? Not my sister. You have the right to see nothing. What are you going to do, Haydée? Since she leaves me, I want to die. Do you love me then? It's like asking her if she loves him. I love him as one loves life, as one loves God. Thy will be done. Love me then. Your love may make me forget now what I need to forget. The count, Jacopo? - What about Haydée? - It was with him, miss. Mr. The Count left you this letter, Your Excellency. "My dear Maximilien," "Jacopo will take them to Liorne," "where Mr. Noirtier awaits you for your wedding." "All that belongs to me in Monte-Cristo and in Paris" "it is the wedding gift of the sailor Edmond Dantès" "to the son of the shipowner Morrel." "Be happy, my children." "Ask the angel who will watch over your life" "to pray for me too." "These prayers may relieve" "the remorse I feel deep in my heart."
