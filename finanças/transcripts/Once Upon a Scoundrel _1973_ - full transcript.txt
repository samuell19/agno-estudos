[tubular bells ringing] [eagle screeching] [tense music playing] [latin music playing] [romantic music playing] NARRATOR: Luis Manuel had always been in love with the beautiful Alicia. However, Luis Manuel was not the only man in love with Alicia. Oh, you're limping little one! What is wrong? My, my, you have a bad bite on the leg. You should see a doctor. Come on. Doctor Fernandez? This duck has a bite on the leg. [whistling] So Doctor Fernandez promised to do what he could, and so I gave him the duck and went on my way. All of a sudden, Santos and Pancho grab me, and Senor del Refugio comes running up shouting that I'm a thief. I'm a thief-- that I should be locked up! You found the duck on my property. Why did you not bring him to me? But Senor del Refugio, I did not know it was your duck. NARRATOR: Ridiculous. Who in village your owns fat ducks? Only me. But all I did was take the duck to Doctor Fernandez. If I did wrong, I'm sorry. Veracruz! Yes? Explain the law. It is the law of this village that when one steals, he is put in jail. [crowd muttering] To remain there until his victim forgives him. That is not the law! I have to stay in jail until he forgives me? Can you not see what Senor del Refugio is doing? Senorita Celestino, we cannot have outbursts like that. We will hear you if you sit on the witness stool. How can you have a court of law when all of you tremble each time Senor del Refugio so much as glances at you? VERACRUZ: It is of most importance that everyone of this court understands [sheep bleating] JUDGE: This is the basis of true justice and all and any evidence must be based on facts. [interposing voices] Baa! Baa! Veracruz, what are you saying? Facts only. It is a fact that Luis did not steal the duck. No one has proved that he has. Go back to your seat, Alicia. That is my case against the accused. In the interest of justice, I want you to examine all the evidence and arrive at a fair verdict-- guilty. [crowd muttering] Well? Guilty. I find the defendant guilty. The law forces me to sentence you to jail. Pepe! - Here. - Lock him up. Lock him up. The court is adjourned. The court is adjourned. Doctor Fernandez, you can have your patient back now. [sad music playing] I am ashamed. Senora Delfina, I want to speak to your niece alone. That was quite a revealing speech you made, Senorita Alicia. It was the truth But you are mistaken about me. I've always had your welfare at heart. Then prove it. Let Luis go. You have had your little joke. There must be law and order. It is my duty to protect the village. Please Senor. You can free Luis by merely forgiving him. Will you not, for me? Alicia, my dove. How can I refuse you anything? Then you will? I'll be happy to free Luis the day you will marry me. And if she will not marry you, what then? Luis will rot in jail. I will trade freedom for Luis only for Alicia. Senor del Refugio, my niece will need time to consider your kind offer. How much time? One month. One hour. One week. One hour. Four days. One hour. Three days. - Two hours. - Two days. - Two hours. - Two days. Two hours. Two days. Agreed. [horse neighing] Diego, did you hear them? Trying to bargain with a Refugio. Still, for a beautiful woman like Senorita Alicia-- Senora Alicia del Refugio. Ow! I do not think I'm going to like it very much. Why not? There is nothing to do. Plenty to eat. I cook very well. Besides, it's gets lonely. I have not had a prisoner since Rodriguez got drunk and called Refugio a fat old toad. But I do not belong here. I did not steal the duck. Oh, relax. Enjoy your stay. At least here, you do not have to work. I love Luis. How can I marry Refugio when I love Luis? You will always love Luis, but we do a great many things in this world that we don't want to do. Aunt Delfina, what am I going to do? You are going to do nothing. Margarita, wake me up early. I do not want to be late for mass. Yes, senor. Oh, and Margarita, I'll have the usual breakfast, only a little bit more. Oh Pancho, clean the courtyard and sweep the stables and wash and brush down Santiago. Yes, senor. Margarita, I want some plump tomatoes. Pick them early in the morning from the vine before the sun gets too high. Yes, senor. Good night, senor. Oh and Pancho, sleep with my horse. I think he's lonely. Yes, senor. Lock the door. Margarita, peel the tomatoes. Yes, senor. [ominous music playing] Let us fight back! Do we go on from grandfather to grandson suffering outrages from the Refugios, or does a time come finally when we have had enough? We have had enough. We have had more than enough. Let us march on the jail. Free him. Break down the door. Yes, break down the door. No! You cannot do that. Why not? If you do, Refugio will throw you all in jail. He's right. Do you know what Refugio has done? He has agreed to free Luis, on one condition only-- that Alicia will marry him. Never. [crowd shouting] Unless we stop him, he will have her. Or do you expect the great Senor to reform overnight? Do you know what Refugio deserves? Death. Let's shoot him. I will do it myself. You will do nothing. Let's torture him. A painful, lingering torture. [crowd shouting] You must listen to me. There must be no violence. We have always lived here in peace. Luis would never forgive you. We must find another way. What a shame he does not get sick and die all by himself. Perhaps we could make Refugio think he was dying. What do you mean think he was dying? If Refugio thought he was dying, he just might forgive Luis. Nonsense. Come on. It was only an idea. No, wait. It is a good idea. The only time any of Refugio's family ever did a nice thing was when they thought they were dying. Santos, Margarita, Pancho, Doctor Fernandez, would you help me? Of course. Delfina, If this works, Luis soon will be free. [snoring] I did it. I hope it works. What is it? Did you rest well, Don Carlos? Of course I rested well. I always rest well. More! What are you staring at? You look like you did not sleep all night. I slept wonderful all night. If you slept wonderful all night, why do you look so tired? What do I care what I look like? I feel wonderful. Where is the ham? You wouldn't look so tired if you were not sick. I've got no fever. I'm not sick. I'm not tired. I'm as strong as a bull. Too many eggs. What is my carriage doing here? Do you feel all right, Don Carlos? I feel wonderful. What is my carriage doing here? We thought it would be best. Margarita is worried about you. She said you must not take chances with your health. I never felt better in my life. But you forgot your cigar. You forgot your hat. Here. For us, Don Carlos, take the carriage. Please. All right. All right. Mass will be over before I get there. [inaudible] You should not be here Refugio. Must see a doctor. Don. [choking] [whistling] [whistling] Hm! What is that? Don Carlos, you undoubtedly have developed some rare malignancy. Rare malignancy? That's wonderful. Something we know nothing about, incurable, fatal. Don Carlos, it's a dread disease. Be brave, Don Carlos. All of us have to go sometime. But I don't want to go! I want to stay. With you have, you cannot stay. You're going to slip away, little by little, by the hour, by the minute. Then, all at once. Margarita, help me. Help me. Help me to the bed. Senor, if I were you, I would start to make preparations. I'm too weak to make preparations. Margarita means amends. Have you no sins? Of course I have sins, but I'm too sick to worry about them now. I would give them some good thought, Don Carlos. I would give them much thought. Now, it's your turn. Pancho, my dear old friend. We thought you might be hungry. Look what we have for you, senor. I'm too sick, too sick. It must be very sad to have to die so misunderstood. Misunderstood? There are many who think wrongly, of course, that you are a mean man. They call me a mean man? Every day. Oh, everybody. They do not know, as we do, what a fine, kind man you really are. I am a kind man. PANCHO: How gentle you are. I am gentle. It is such a pity. What can I do? [whispering] What can I do? Well, you could-- so that all would remember you as a kind and gentle man, senor, you could surprise everyone. You could make one final gesture. Gesture? What kind of gesture? Don Carlos, before it is too late. PANCHO: Before the chance is gone. MARGARITA: Before there is no turning back. PANCHO: Remember your sins. Forgive your enemies. MARGARITA: Give your blessings to poor Luis, or by the law he will have to spend his whole life in jail. Good. Good. Knowing that Luis will spend his life in jail is the only pleasure I will get out of dying! [laughing] [groaning] Luis? Luis? Can you hear me? Oh, Alicia. I'm so glad to see you. I have something for you. What is it? Your favorite, honey cake. How are you? Oh, I'm fine. And you? Worried about you. Do you think I will be in here a long time? You must have faith. I love you Luis. I love you too Alicia. [ominous music playing] [interposing voices] Stop! Stop! Listen to me! Wait! Let's listen to Delfina! What is it? Last night we agreed there should not be violence, and there will be none. We made him believe that he was sick. Now, we must do more. We must make believe that he's dead. Make him believe that he is dead? Listen to me. Wait. We'll give him a sleeping powder, and when he's drugged, we will bury him. Then, when he awakes, we all treat him like a ghost-- pretend we cannot see him or hear him. Just ignore him, until he agrees to forgive Luis. I'll give him a funeral he'll never forget. Doctor Fernandez, it all depends on you. Can you give him a medicine that will work? I think I know how to do it. Take one of this, two of this. Or is it three of this, two of this and one of this? Your life is at stake. Get away. Get away. Don't you see what I'm doing? Do not drink that. Looks like it's going to work. It's very potent, some rare herbs, an old formula. Have you used it before? I would rather not talk about it. I don't trust you. You're not even a real doctor. You're a pig and duck doctor. I understand, Don Carlos. Why should you take medicine that does not smell good? Your own prayers will be of more help in these final hours. Stop talking about my final hours. Smoke, if you want. Yes. Get drunk. Be happy while you can. Do you have any last requests? What-- what was in that medicine? Do you think it really can cure me? I hoped, as a last resort, it might perform a miracle. Perhaps I should try, just a little taste. I must warn you. A medicine that can perform miracles is a medicine that cures or kills. That may be all right for your horses, but not for me. I say, that without this medicine there is no hope. With it, there is a 50-50 chance. 50-50? Yes. Either I'm right, or I'm wrong. That is 50-50. [hiccups] I feel much better already. Good. Now, you must lie back quietly, and wait. The main thing is that you do not go to sleep. Go to sleep. Yes. If you go to sleep-- [hiccups] I already feel a little sleepy. You feel sleepy? Do you feel dizzy? No, no, I don't feel dizzy. I don't feel dizzy. Does your head feel heavy? No, no. My head doesn't feel heavy. [snoring] Do you feel your eyes closing? No, no. No, I will not close them. [snoring] I must stay awake. I will smoke. I will not go to sleep. What will we do know that this he is gone? He had so much to give. Cut down in the prime of his life. MARGARITA: Such a fine man. Such a peaceful sight. Such a fat old toad. It worked! [screaming] Get out of here! We haven't much time. We must hurry. I'm not sure how long the drug will last. Father! Where are you going? Where are you going? To the convent, to hear confessions. No, not today, Father. We need you here. Senor Carlos del Refugio has died. What? What? Senor Carlos del Refugio has died. He had died. Yes, Father. It was a very sudden. May his soul rest in peace. You go and make the arrangements, and I will be back in time for the funeral. No, Father. He must be buried at once. What? He must be buried at once. Ah, of course. But why at once? Because-- because he died from a contagious disease. A what? A contagious disease. We must consider the village and the children. Oh, yes. The children, the children. He must be buried at once. I think the sisters will have to wait. Oh, I'm sure. I'm not hungry. You better eat. I will not be back until after the sun goes down. [ominous music playing] They are here. Hurry! Quick. Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to pay our last respects to Carlos del Refugio. Blessed are they who do hunger and thirst-- [cough] [sneeze] --hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled. Ashes to ashes, and dust to dust. The name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost, amen. Amen. Remember, when he wakes up, you must not speak to him. You must pretend not to see him or hear what he says. We understand. Quickly, quickly. Doctor Fernandez! It worked! I'm alive! It's a miracle. What are you doing? Are you crazy? You're a horse doctor. What is this? Where am I? Aha! Santos, Pancho, my old friends. Come here. Help me up out of the grave. Help me. You are no longer in my employ! What's the matter with you? Doesn't anywhere hear me? Get me out of here! Get me out! Oh, how sweet of you, Senorita. [inaudible] [inaudible],, you will go to jail. I warn you. You're going to go to jail. Help me out. Help me! Did you hear anything? Only the church bells! Are you all deaf? What's the matter with you? If you can hear the church bells, you can hear me. Ding, dong. Ding, dong. Ah, my friend [inaudible]. Right in my-- you are no longer [inaudible].. I warn you. I warn-- ah, [inaudible],, you'r the one who did this to me. [inaudible]. What do I do? How will I get out? Come back? Come back, all of you! Come back! Come back! Carlos del Refugio. That's me. It doesn't even look like me. [HIGH TEMPO ORCHESTRAL MUSIC PLAYING] Senor Veracruz! Stop! I want to talk to you! What are you doing? Cruz, you are crazy! Stop! Stop! I am talking to you, Cruz. They are driving my carriage. He is coming! He is coming! Where is everybody? I know you're in there. Come on out. Come out. Out! Open up! Open up! I know you're there. I know! Margarita! You know what you did to me? [inaudible] Come on, do you hear me? I'll tear your house down! [somber music playing] Margarita! Pancho! Pancho! Where is everybody? Where are you? Senor Carlos Refugio Senor Carlos Refugio is dead. That's me. Am I alive, or am I dead? If I am alive-- if I am dead, why do I have to--? Here he comes! Do you want me to stay? No. No, Filipe. Go to your room. No, no. Come back. Sit over there. Pretend you're running the yarn. FILIPE: I, for one, will never miss him. The son of a goat. Who would miss him? He was good for nothing. ALICIA: He was the meanest man that ever lived. Who was the meanest man that ever lived? That Refugio, he was also the ugliest man who ever lived. I cannot believe that he thought I would marry him. Oh, is that so? He was not only mean and ugly, he was a dirty, two-faced miser. You be careful what you say. Look! I am here! He was not only a mean, ugly, two-faced miser. He was even worse-- Refugio was a scoundrel. You should not talk about the dead that way Senorita Alicia. A lot of good his lands and power do him now. And that is not the worst of it. Remember the legend? What legend? What legend? What legend? You know the legend, Alicia. Oh, yes, the legend. What legend? The legend of the wandering soul. It is said that those who lead this life, after having lived by acts of selfishness and stinginess, who have been hateful and unforgiving, shall pay the price by wandering forever, homeless, friendless, until they have righted all the wrongs of their past. You mean he cannot go to heaven? Heaven? He couldn't even go to the other place. He doesn't belong anywhere. I think I remember my grandmother telling me about wandering souls. Homeless, friendless. So that's what's happening to me? The legend of the wandering soul. Santiago! What are you doing here? My dear friend. My dearest, my best friend. He does not see me. He loves carrots. Santiago. Santiago, carrots-- you always like them. Take a bite. Take a bite of the carrot. Take a little bit of the carrot Santiago. Santiago. He does not recognize me. He does not know me. Friendless, homeless, horseless. Here lies Carlos Refugio. Asleep within the sod. Never trusted any man. He now must trust in God. Am I in or am I out? Open! Open up! Please, open up! You must open up! I've died. I want to rest. This grave is mine. Mine! Mine! Mine! DELFINA (THOUGHT): They shall wander forever. Homeless, friendless. Graveless. DELFINA (THOUGHT): Until they have righted all the wrongs of their past. She is right. [light orchestral music] What am I hiding for? Nobody can see me. Baa! Wake up! Wake up! This is all your fault. We have to get you out of here. Senor Refugio? You can see me? Yes. You can't see me. I can see you, but what happened? Where am I? Right there. Touch my nose. This is amazing. You can see me. Why is that? He might want me to see you senor? Perhaps it has something to do with the legend. What legend? I'm sure it has something to do with the legend. You have come here to free me senor? Yes, but we must get you out of here before that idiot wakes up. He must not see you escape. But why do I have to escape if you're going to free me? Stop asking question and do as you're told! Shh. I still get hot and tired and out of breath. We have been walking fast. And I am hungry. Why should I be hungry. If you want to be hungry, why should you not be hungry? Water! Would you believe it? This is the first drink I've had since before my funeral. Since before your funeral? I had a terrible day. It was nothing like I expected. How would you like it if you ended up like me? You mean rich? Rich? I am no longer rich. Why, I can't even get into do my own coffin. Senor, this may be serious. We've got to get to the doctor. Fernandez? He could not even help me when I was alive. No, Luis. It is not a doctor I need. Where are you going? Come back here. Sit down. I feel better on my feet. I said sit down, please. Last night, I died. Today, they gave me a wonderful funeral. You don't look a bit dead to me Senor. Of course I'm dead, ask anybody. Are you sure you didn't dream all this? Come, I will show you how dead I am. Where are we going? No more questions. Do as you're told. I forgive him! There, read that. Oh, that's very beautiful, senor. What does it say? Proclamation, greetings. Senor Carlos Refugio is dead Senor Carlos Refugio. That's me. He left no heir whereupon everyone is forbidden to enter this rancho in order that it may rot away unattended and in decay, become a fitting memorial to the meanest [inaudible],, signed Victor Cruz, mayor. Now, do you believe I'm dead? Of course you're dead senor, it says so right there. It's official. Senor? How does it feel to be dead? No different at all. That's what bothers me. I think I should be able to fly or something. Not everybody who dies flies senor. That's what bothers me. And I'm so hungry I could faint. Luis Manuel. Do you think we could steal some chickens? Well, I know where we might find some. Where? You know the field next to the village with the tall grass? Oh, that's where you stole my fat duck! No I did not steal your duck. I forgive you. You think we will find some chickens there? We'll find some. Good. Mm, I raised wonderful chickens. I'm getting full. I never get full. I didn't know ghosts could eat. Of course they do. Only most people cannot see them. What are we going to do now? I don't know. I have it. Have what? An idea, a great idea. [inaudible] But first, you must sneak back into jail. Back into jail? Only until they discover their letter. What letter? I will write a letter to say that I forgive you for stealing my duck. But what good will that do? It will free you from jail legally. How can it be legal if you're a ghost? It will be legal because it will say I wrote it before I died. Then, I will smuggle it-- I will smuggle it into Alicia's room, and leave which she can find it. Do not worry. Luis-- Don Carlos, you are such a changed man. I like you much better dead. [airy music playing] Luis. No, Carlos. What are you doing here? You too can see me? No, senor. I cannot see you, but I can hear you. I hear the voice of Senor Refugio. But you cannot see me? No, senor. You did not feel my kiss? You kissed me? Yes, I kissed you. You are so beautiful, and you are alone. If you do not get out of here, senor, I will wake the whole village. Who cares? No one can see me? You should be ashamed of yourself, a ghost acting this way. You are so beautiful, kiss me. Do not come another step closer. You cannot escape me. Kiss me. Filipe, what's wrong? Are you all right Delfina? Yes, yes. [inaudible]. What happened? What is wrong, Alicia? He's here. Who's here? The ghost of Refugio. He's been chasing me around this room. But you cannot see him. No? No, you can only hear him. A talking ghost. That is right. We cannot have him haunting Alicia. Close the window. Close the door. It's closed. Filipe, you know how to deal with a ghost. No? In the old days, when they caught him in a room, they would cut his heart out and burn it. Very interesting. I understand. Then bring the machetes. What machetes? What was that? He was talking to us, I think. Where did Filipe go? Ghost of Refugio, why have you come here? Why? To do you a great kindness. Where did Felipe go? Where is that scoundrel? I will cut him to pieces. You could hurt somebody with that thing. I am not afraid of you, ghost of Refugio. Filipe, I'm over there. Alicia, Alicia, tell him to stop. We do not need you in our world! We can live without you. I will cut your heart out. [screaming] [inaudible], please stop. I promise I will haunt you no more. I only came to deliver this letter. Damn, you must-- Stop, Filipe! Put that away. Thank you Alciia. You won't be sorry. Listen to this. To Luis Manuel and to whom it may concern, dear friend Luis, this letter tells you that I forgive you for stealing my best duck. Go your way and be happy with the blessing of your dear friend Carlos del Refugio. Oh, P.S. I am writing this letter the day before I died. Oh, senor. You have made me very happy. I have a feeling inside of me, I never had before, and it's wonderful. You have found your heart senor. Is it not a lovely feeling? I'd like to do more. I would like to give my blessing to your marriage to Luis. Oh senor, if I could see you, I would kiss you. Ghost of Refugio, I can see you. And so can I. We all can see you. Thank you, senor. God bless you. God bless you, too. Is there anything left upstairs? No, senor. This is all there is, and your bedroom. Then there is nothing left? Nothing. The rest belongs to you. The whole rancho is yours. [shouting] Senor Cruz, major Cruz, for you, I have something special. Yes? Close your eyes. Open. My chair belongs to you. It has been in the family for generations. We have a chair. Ah, I have something much better. I give you this beautiful portrait of my grandmother. Take the chair. - Thank you Don Carlos. - We'll carry. No, no, no, no. It's his chair now. You both can see me now? Yes, we can see you. We can hear you too. I cannot see you, senor. Come Victor. Rodriguez, he just gave us the land we live on, and all the livestock we raised. Isn't that wonderful? When he understands how we've tricked him, he will be worse than ever. You cannot change Refugio. Nora Gomez, what do you want? I need money. Take what you need. Take more. Thank you. Don't touch that. That belongs to me. Senora Gomez, what is your little girl's name? Juanita. Juanita? Here. Take this. Thank you senor. You are a good man Juanita. [music box playing] Next! [happy latin music] Everybody can see me. Yes, senor. It is wonderful. The people are no longer afraid. True. And we have come to ask you to be the best man at the wedding. Me? Senor, It would make us very happy. I would be greatly honored. Come, everyone, to the wedding! [happy latin music] In nomine Patri et filii et spiritu santi, amen. Amen. What are you doing here? I buried you yesterday. I am a ghost now, father. Oh. I give these coins as a symbol of all my worldly goods. I accept them, and you. [organ playing] Delfina, we have done a terrible thing. No, doctor, what we have done is wonderful. We have given a man a chance to find himself. A chance to open his heart. He's a happy man. NARRATOR: And so, Refugio, lived happily ever after in the hereafter. Not bad, for a scoundrel. [lively latin music playing]
