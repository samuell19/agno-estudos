Thanks,Cathy,I'd like to, but some other time Promise? Promise Hello.What's the matter? -I thought I was being followed -Were you? I don't know,I am not sure, I don't know if I'm going crazy Afraid answer the phone afraid open the door I miss you,Marsh I do too, but we can't leave it sort of things,we're taking too much of a chance Is that the only reason, you haven't called me? Do you think I like this? Paulie,be sensible,we have no excuse to see each other except on business If the police start asking questions, they only start thinking Still don't know what we are going to do when Lynburys get back and discover the robbery and tie that up together with Ralph's death So not seeing each other would be a permanent arrangement? Of course not.When things calm down, we can be together, just as we planned Sick of sitting around the house, I hate it now,give me the creep The business is an alibi,Marsh,was that little wide eyed secretary I saw you holding hands with her at the funeral Pauline,stop it,you know better than that Do I? Then why have you been brushing me off? What are we fighting about? We got everything we wanted now and have everything right here We can be together Isn't that what we wanted Marsh? It is But I didn't expect the price to be so high High? We do not have to run away now, you are in charge of the office ours or will be as soon as the new trucks starts paying off Business is another excuse,bring some papers over to me to sign tonight Paulie,for heavens sake,show him a little respect,he has only been dead a week All right,Marsh But I want to hear from you tomorrow and I want to make sure it is business that keeps you occupied You go out first,the suitcase is in back of my car at the parking lot Tomorrow,Marsh Is it something you wish,Madam? You haven't got it We can't copy this bracelet You see,each of our designs, is exclusive We could design one for you and invite some of the features you like Here it is,Mrs Pauline Nevins That was Ralph Nevins who Yes,you see they are friends of mine,I want to have this bracelet copied for my wife Your wife? Yeah, If you wait a moment I'll speak to my partner and see if we can make an exception -Operator -Give me the police Yes sir That was the position we found the body in the gun had fallen on the wall just above the drive way That's it,Philip Outside the call about the bracelet I haven't got a single lead Not even a hunch Nothing very plausible,I am going to check the bracelet -Hi,Inspector -Hi A ghost I had him trailing Mrs Nevins. What happened? She led me down every backstreet and alley in town I finally lost her in the Riverside district She's a pretty cagey dame No one is that cagey unless something to hide Maybe my hunch was better than I thought Inspector,what do you think.. Erickson,I got a wiring job for you I'm leaving for home now,Marsh,I'll have this report out for you in the morning And don't forget your raincoat, it started to rain Is there anything I can do for you? Yes,Cathy,there is.You can make that stew That's wonderful.We'd better get to store before it closes I'll get you the coat for you Get the door for you Right up these stairs.Heavy? No,not a bit Get your things outside the door I'll get.Here Did you finally get friendly with the birdie? I know this afternoon.Watched your apartment for hours How did you get in here? Said Please to your landlady with a twenty dollar bill It's suicide if anyone knows you are here,don't you realize Don't try to brush me off, Marsh,as I stick,I stick hard You're drunk Fix you some coffee Sure I'm drunk,it figures, I find your bottle of Scotch Been here a long time You are making a fool of yourself Why have I been here so long time,Marsh? Do you think time went faster for her? Cathy has done everything she could to help It includes fixing dinner for you,that's great! She knows how to cook,she is getting at your heart through your stomach Whole discussion making me sick Paulie,I don't want to talk to you when you are like this Maybe a good cook but she is slow,it's two o'clock,why Marsh? Why her? It's just she is there when I am not Paulie,stop,I don't want to discuss her She is too fair and pure for me to discuss We can talk about this tomorrow, we have enough trouble as it is Why? Because of you.We were going to be great together we're going to be great just the two of us,don't forget that you're in it every bit as deep as I am,you got me into it,I killed Ralph for you,so don't you accu.. You killed Ralph Marsh,right,I didn't mean to It was an accident,it was self defense He had a gun,he was going to kill me He was going to kill you,he knew you were down there I did it for you,Marsh,I did it for you Why didn't you tell me? Why didn't you tell the police it was self defense? it was nothing they could have done to you Don't know.I was afraid that no one would believe me And when you said that they had shot him I don't know,I don't know what I thought,I was scared It doesn't matter now,it's over The important thing is that we still got each other Like it had to happen in this way We got the money,we got each other Unless that little tramp changed your mind for you? Paulie I get to go to the office early tomorrow Is Ralph's desk give you ideas? You figure now that you are in the driver's seat with a little secretary to play footsie with on a 24 hour shift? Don't you forget it,it is my company and I'm paying her salary and yours,buster You're drunk.You don't realize what you are saying Drink this and try to sober up, I'm going to take you home Your hands off from me You're not taking me anywhere If I was dead,you couldn't take me to the morgue -Good Morning,Gentlemen -Hi,boss You are back a bit early Yes,I got back early,thanks to your blundering stupidity You told us it was going to be a simple job,we got hijacked That's was he was therefore with a gun OK,OK it was my fault for recommending him, I tried to tell him but he is green He doesn't know to pull a job like this I keep telling you can't relax in this business Don't push me fat boy I'm not interested in excuses Do you really think we would double cross you? I swear on my mother's grave, that stuff was hijacked we couldn't double cross you, we couldn't handle anything that big And who got it? I swear I don't know,I got no idea at all Job came out simple just like you said ,until we got outside the house And the guy there with a gun in the belly and the kid standing there with his gun in his belt and this Nevins guy get killed from I don't know where he comes So we think we figure we ought to lay low You didn't get a look at the man who hijacked you? No its dark and we are shooting at him and he's running who can see? Hey,how about How about shutting up,you have done enough talking If you been on your toes this wouldn't have happened We figure as soon as things calm down we'll spread out and start looking Well,gentlemen I see no advantage in continuing this conversation now You will not of course leave town I'll be in touch with you shortly You with your big mouth,you almost ruined everything What you take me for?Why didn't you tell him about finding Nevin's bracelet? Look,kid,shut up let me doing the thinking for both of us you know what we get for this lousy safe job That doll is mixed up in a killing that bracelet is got to be worth a minimum of hundred grands with no hot jewellery to peddle The jeweler actually saw the bracelet yesterday,Mrs Nevins why did you not report this loss at once? It happened just a few days before I don't know whether it was a restaurant or a show we’ve been to Would have reported it sooner except with my husband's death I forgot about it We have a description of the bracelet, we already put out a bulletin The one point we never been able to clear up,Mrs Nevins,is the motive On the evening of his death Mr Nevins made an appointment with his lawyer on an urgent business matter You drove him to the office but he left almost at once without even talking with Mr Franklin He left in a rented car There must have been some very pressing reason.You have an explanation? I had very little to do with my husband's business affairs It appears to have been a personal affair,Mrs Nevins It's often difficult to separate business affairs and personal ones I beg you pardon Nothing.It's just that my husband never discussed business What would I have known of anything of my husband's personal affairs? She would know if there was another woman involved This trip you planned to take was it a reconciliation? Whatever it was,it doesn't matter now,Ralph is dead That's why we are asking these questions,Mrs Nevins One reason for a man to rent a car is to avoid detection Tell me did Mr Nevins had something to hide? Did you suspect another woman? Perhaps you even followed him once Did you Mrs Nevins? Who was that woman? Please I can't tell you anymore Mrs Nevins, a moment ago you said it was sometimes difficult to separate business and private affairs That could mean someone connected with his business was it his secretary? I think we better have a talk with her That's not fair.I can't accuse someone of murder just because she was close to him Do you happen to accuse her of the murder,have you,Mrs Nevins? You leave the accusations to us,that's our job Sorry if we disturbed you,Mrs Nevins Hello Who? If this is the lady who has been calling he is said to tell you he is not here -Hi,boy -Mrs Rycker You get a prize if you finnish the bowl by noon No lectures,Phyl There are no lectures.Tell me something, Paulie,what are you trying to prove? I saw the two gentlemen callers as I came in,they looked like a lot of laugh Six months for talking to myself You don't mind me taking a swim,do you? Unfortunately I can't convince Tom that a plumbing contractor is in the swimming pool class Though we do have a sensational bathroom Paulie,this is the first laugh I ever heard out of you in days come on,come on in with me It's really good,you could use all that water to chase the Scotch As a matter of fact I need the exercise, my waste line is getting a little aggressive you know what I mean? Bathing caps,ruin your social life after five You're ready Hey,doesn't it feel great? Paulie,the police have been to see me so Tom is getting jealous I haven't told them anything because I don't know anything but all that's doing is hurting you Is there something I can do to help you? No,thanks, though no OK Mrs Nevins? Instead of that old cliche "haven't I seen you some place before" I'm going to ask you just the opposite haven't you seen me somewhere? What do you want? I think we both want the same thing Phyl I want you I just remembered I had a very important engagement A little older than I figured,but I suppose he has hidden talents Phyl You don't have to explain to me,next to nothing,expected something a little younger Paulie I had a most divine afternoon I can't say I'd love to to stay to have a drink, but you can't talk me into it You know how it is to have million things to do as a matter of fact Tom is having some guests for dinner,out of town you know how that is,I'll check with you You are a most unlikely hijacker I should think you could get anything you wanted just for the asking I won't trouble you with the details of how I finally traced you and deduced that you murdered your late husband I shall come at once at the important point I'd like to have my jewellery back Your jewellery? It was Mrs Lynbury's jewellery Indeed.Well you see,Mrs Nevins I am doctor Lynbury Doubtless you will want me to be seated I believe I can speak in perfect confidence with you because we are in the same boat so to speak,honor among thieves If you really are Dr Lynbury,what was you doing robbing your own home? That Mrs Nevins is really an interesting story unfortunately the talented people are not always the wealthy people have you not noticed that? I had talent but no money until I married Mrs Lynbury charming woman you must meet her she inherited among other things a splendid collection of jewellery Do sit down,Mrs Nevins After I married it was unnecessary for me to work but I couldn't bear to think of myself as a parasite So I copied my wife's entire jewellery collection in payson stone I sold the real gems one by one You mean all those jewellery we got was false? Not false in reference to such superior workmanship It's true the stones you hijacked were copies but it would take an expert to spot them I wonder if I might have a little of this soda water No ice To return to my story having disposed of the real gems it occurred to me that it might be possible to reap a double profit So I arranged for the payson jewellery to be stolen so that I may collect the insurance It was at this point you entered the picture and muddled up what should have been a magnificently simple job You can understand how awkward it would be if it were discovered that the jewels were false I would be faced with the charge of fraud by the insurance people you of course would be faced with a murder charge Naturally nothing we say here would go any further What I'm asking is not at all unreasonable since in any case the jewels are worthless to you I can return to you something of real value I could have improved upon the design but it is rather well made I don't have the jewels I hope,Mrs Nevins,that you are not going to make any trouble because I assure you I have had no compunction against killing you You are going to make trouble all right but not the way you think You want that junk back go ahead and get it Where? At Mr EV Marshall n152 Marquia Apartment 305 Gentlemen,what can I do for you We're interested in the little lady outside,Cathy Stevens How did she and Nevins get along socially? Come on,Lieutenant,what's on your mind? It's just we have reasons to believe she was more than a secretary to him Cathy and Ralf Nevins? Ridiculous After you've been doing the work I do for a while,nothing sounds ridiculous Mrs Nevins doesn't think so? Mrs Nevins told you this? Certainly,it would explain things,wouldn't it? Nevins was carrying on an affair with his secretary then he decided to break up with her and take his wife for a long trip Secretary knew where he kept the gun went with him to a deserted mountain spot and shot him That is ridiculous Happens every day Mrs Nevins is lying Why should she lie? What else could she possibly have against Stevens? It's just not true Ask Miss Stevens to come in,please Look,In tell you she did not know anything about this We are paid to make our own decisions Ask her to come in,please Miss Stevens would you come in please Stevens,would you tell us again what you did on the night Mr Nevins was killed I went home.I went straight home from the office What did you do? I suppose I went to sleep Cathy,what they want to know.. Let Miss Stevens tell her own story,Mr Marshall You went home and went to sleep. Can anyone confirm that? I live alone,Sergeant About what time was it when you went to sleep? I don't know it was late Can you recall what you did between the time you arrived home and the time you went to sleep? Let's see.I washed out a few things, I fixed dinner,I watched television And then what did you do? I took a shower and I went to bed But you didn't go to sleep right away? No,not right away And you never left your apartment at any time that night? I didn't say that Suppose you say it now? Did you or did you not leave your apartment that night? Yes,I did Where did you go? To Mr Marshall's apartment I see I'm sorry Let's put this right up the creek It was a good try,Cathy,but why? They never believe that I'm sorry.I had to try to give you an alibi Give me an alibi? Yes.You were there.Both of you were there You and Mrs Nevins He was going to kill her.And you killed him to save her What makes you say that? I heard the recording he had made The one you had erased You knew From the beginning? Yes I tried to pretend I didn't, I was so afraid for you, Marsh Afraid to find out I was even afraid to tell you I didn't kill him I swear I didn't If you only knew what really happened I only knew that whatever happened it was not your fault It was my fault,Cathy Everything was my fault It started out wrong and everything I had done had made it worse Now I even beginning to corrupt you Thank you.Thanks for trying to help me I wish I hadn't done it You see I love you I think I have loved you from the first moment I ever saw you You are not the kind of man,who can spend his whole life,lying and hiding I knew about her I prayed.I don't mind I prayed you would not go on sacrificing your whole life for them and what work Oh,Cathy I wish I'd known I'm sorry No, You are the one clean thing in all this dirt I want to keep you that way I wanted you to know,no matter what happens,it can't change the way I feel I think it can I'm calling the police Call for you,Mrs Nevins Hello,Marsh Oh,it's you You better come down here right away We got a real mess in our hands This guy decided someone take over the office Take over? What about Marsh? He wouldn't even say what's wrong Who? Cathy is not here either, she must have left with him Do what you want 350000$ we were going to sell them Cut yourself off from your home and your family You must have loved her very much I'd like to be million miles away from here So I could start over I wouldn't answer that phone if I were you I'll take that briefcase,please Just a minute,doctor Let's have a look at this Must have been a fortune in here I suppose you gentlemen You can follow us all right,polite,let's go I may as well tell you the whole story Yes,inspector,yes we'll keep watch Don't let her slip through your fingers Allen and Jennings are on their way Yes,inspector -Hello -Hi I feel ill,Phyl Paulie,what's the matter with you,you sound beefed More than that.I'm going away, Phyllis,I don't know where,just go away Listen Paulie.Don't do anything foolish. You've been in that before and believe me you can get over it (Phyllis)Besides there is no point running away I'm glad you came back Yes I came back.You made sure I would win you told the police about Cathy,that was a rotten line thing to do I'm sorry I was jealous I wanted to hurt you in anyway I could, I do not know why I acted the way I did I don't know why do the most of things I do Don't start feeling sorry for yourself, Paulie,there isn't time Not anymore It took me until now to see you as you really are I get a good look at myself Look.We can still get away Forget about the money.Forget everything.I only want you I've got a little money of my own,enough to let us go out of the country I know it sounds crazy coming from me,but I want to start over,start clean Clean? Are we supposed to forget that Ralph is dead? Nothing you can do will change that, nothing can wash away that kind of dirt Don't you give me that holy stuff, what are you,some kind of a martyr You're just as guilty as I am You were rotten from the beginning,Paulie, you are nothing but a cheap ordinary Sorry Marsh We shouldn't be fighting darling what's done is done, we can't change anything we have to make the best of it, all that matter is that you're here You want me,you can't deny it, or you wouldn't come back Oh,darling as long as we love each other I was in love with someone I thought you were Someone wonderful,someone I dreamed of I'll be like that,Marsh I'll do anything you want, we'll start all over again like there has been never any other people,no one but us As long as you live you will never even understand what I thought you were I'm sorry,Paulie,but it is too late He is right,Mrs Nevins,it is too late You called them? That's why I came back to tell you You both have to come back with us to the headquarter Come on,Marshall All right,Mrs Nevins,we have to go now I'll change into something decent All right if I change up there? Yes Don't try to run away, Mrs Nevins,you won't get far I've done all the running I am going to Marsh,Marsh I told you I am not worth it,Cathy That's something you just can't decide for me I'm sorry Miss Stevens Let's go Subtitles by Seglora
