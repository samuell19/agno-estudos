Harika... Harika. Drop your signatures on these marks. Hello. Hello. I can help you, but only if you speak! Hello. -You can trust me. I'm here to help you. Treat me as a stranger and share your sorrows with me. I'll not judge you. Well, I... don't know where to start. I... don't even know what to do. My mind is telling me to die. Then die. Yes, I'm serious! Go and die. I don't want to change your decision. I just want to help you. You can't help. Infact, no one can. Yes, I can't help you, but I can offer some advice, right? Advice, huh? What advice will you give me? Will you advise me how to die? Nope, I'll tell you how to die without pain. What the deuce is that? You've already decided to die, right? Just postpone that for 4-5 hours. Do you have a habit of consuming alcohol? No. Good. Listen to me. Just have a shot! Oh, this is your so-called suggestion, huh? Yes, if we have a shot, we can die happily as there'll be no pain. We will land in hell if we die in tears. And we land in heaven if we die happily. You think about whether you'll die in pain and suffocation or with happiness? It's up to you. Ma'am. Ma'am, your order? I have no idea. Get me something which will make me high. Okay, ma'am. Well... sir ordered for you. THESE WILL GET YOU HIGH. CHEERS. Don't waste your time hitting on me. It won't work. Alas! Nothing like that ma'am. I just ordered for you because you looked confused. Please carry on! Gosh! Ravi... -Sir. I'm done and you please carryon. One more. -Okay, sir. Thanks. Ma'am, don't get me wrong. I ordered tequila as you want to get high fast. Sorry. -No, that's okay. Shall I tell you something? Don't stare at them. Just drink. At first your throat burns. Then your stomach. Later, you'll be least bothered about it. [coughs] Ravi, 4 tequila shots. -Okay, ma'am. Holy Jesus! You came alone so early in the morning and drank too much. And you're angry too. Now, I get it. Someone dumped you, right? Dumped? -I mean, love failure batch? No, I have not failed in love but failed in life. Life failure, huh? Sounds delightful. Tell me more. -Delightful? Huh. Well, you said you failed in life, and I felt interested. I'm sorry. I'll take back my words. Okay? It's okay. What's your name? Harsha. Harika. Nice to meet you. -Salutations. Cheers. -Cheers. Ha-Ri-Ka. "Harika." "Harika" means "wonderful" in English, doesn't it? What a wonderful name! Change your name as Wonderful. It'll changes your life too. You are over imagining! My life isn't that wonderful. It's just a circus. You said it seems interesting, yes it'll be interesting. I'm sorry, I'm drunk. Please don't mind me. It's okay, fine. I can't have these shots now. I am feeling sick. Could you order something mild? How can I order for you? You had four tequila shots smoothly. I don't drink, Harsha. This is my first time. Really? I didn't see it like that. You just had them like a pro-PUBG player! Anyways, I'll suggest a good drink. Ravi. -Yes, sir. One vodka and Sprite. -Okay, sir. Cheers Ms. Harika. Cheers, Harsha. It's our day, Ms. Harika. I'll be with you till the day ends. I just told you, didn't I? You are just beating around the bush. It won't work on me. Sweet Lord, please. I'm not trying to impress you. I'm just drunk. I swear on my drink. I speak like this. Don't take it serious. -Do you always talk like this? -What to do? Every smiling face has a lot of sorrow behind it. We should cover it with our smiles. How can you cover it? Can we smile when we are sad? No, but it's waste of time to feel bad. Even I have got hurt since my childhood. Since childhood? Why did you get hurt then? What to say, madam? My parents died when I was a child. I cried a lot, did they come back? My uncle adopted me and used to beat the shit out of me. I cried a lot. Did he stop hurting me? Holy crap, that was the highlight! I cried thinking about my life. Did my life change? Then, I decided to forget my worries by drinking. Will our problems get solved if we drink? Hello, madam, you are also drinking with me. Did your your problems get solved? Oh, boy, I'm drinking to get courage. Don't compare. I'm drinking because I'm addicted. What? I'm not an alcoholic, but what to do? My life is full of disasters. In addition to this, after Tarun's entry, my luck took exit. I failed my exams. Really? Let's go and drink. My uncle kicked me out of the house. Let's go and drink. Tyre got punctured. Let's go and drink. He made me drink in every occasion, but now he's a software engineer and is earning Rs. 1 lakh per month. Disaster fellow. Anyway, why should we talk about him while drinking? [notification tone] Is everything okay? I'll leave if you don't want to talk. No, we feel people are our strength when things are good. But, in our downfall, the same people will speak ill about us. Wow, what a dialogue. Sounds like it's from a movie. Ravi, 4 tequilas. Now. -Okay, ma'am. What, four again? No. Consumption of too much liquor is injurious to your liver. Fast, Ravi. What is this? Why are you so frustrated? Harsha... My mother was distributing sweets one day. Hi. Greetings, dear. -Greetings. Hi, Harika. -Hi. Mom, what's all this? Your father arranged a party as you got selected in campus placements. Go and get ready. Who informed you about this? I called Shreya because your phone was out of reach. She told me. Get ready fast. -No, it's like... It'll be awkward as everyone is present. Go and get ready. What happened, Harika? Why are you so dull? What's this, Dad? Why didn't you inform me about this party? Don't feel bad. I feel proud for everything you achieve. Their kids didn't even clear their exams. I feel so proud. Dad, I don't want to get a job. My friend and I want to start a company. I'm not interested in this job. Okay, go and sleep. We'll talk about this later. Whom did you consult regarding your job, Harika? Couldn't you tell us at least? We informed everyone. What should we do now? What will they think? They may think we lied to them. They may think that we did this for false prestige. Tulasi, just wait. Dear. I'm not angry with you and your decision. But we are not from business background and none of our friends are businessmen. All our people have jobs. How can you manage? Our Murthy's son wasted six years of his life on these start-ups. Is it good to loose our chance? Dad, I'm not Murthy's son. I have a focus, clarity and vision. Please believe me like you always do. Give me a chance. I've done my masters in marketing. I want to use my skills for myself. Don't you think it's a great idea? Like a digital marketing and advertising company? We'll start in Hyderabad and I want to provide job for others. Your idea is good. Who is this friend with whom you are starting this start-up? Sharan, my classmate. He's a very good person. Our ideas match. Dad, I won't take wrong decisions as I'm your daughter. I never doubted you and now also I'm not. But, business is not that easy. And your colleagues should also be good in order to succeed. Promise, Dad. I'll make you proud. -I'm already proud of you. It's my foolishness to stay between you and your daughter. ♪ Does your smile resemble The sound of a flowing river? ♪ ♪ Does your craziness resemble The glow of a rainbow? ♪ ♪ Shall I sing a song with you Like a cuckoo on a tree? ♪ ♪ Or can I dance with you Like a moving doll? ♪ ♪ I don't know what this is But this is new ♪ ♪ And this brings change in myself ♪ ♪ Like a moving tale Presenting in a gift ♪ ♪ And showing it A grand event of my wishes ♪ ♪ And my breaths Are taking in new ways ♪ ♪ I don't know what this is But this is new ♪ ♪ Does your craziness resemble The glow of a rainbow? ♪ ♪ Shall I sing a song with you Like a cuckoo on a tree? ♪ ♪ Or can I dance with you Like a moving doll? ♪ ♪ This moment... ♪ ♪ Has to be cherished forever, dear ♪ ♪ This happiness has to Come with you, like a dream ♪ ♪ I'm intoxicated In this love shower ♪ ♪ I don't know what this is But this is new ♪ ♪ And this brings me a new change ♪ ♪ Does your smile resemble The sound of a flowing river? ♪ ♪ Does your craziness resemble The glow of a rainbow? ♪ ♪ Shall I sing a song with you Like a cuckoo on a tree? ♪ ♪ Or can I dance with you Like a moving doll? ♪ ♪ I don't know what this is But this is new ♪ ♪ Does your smile resemble The sound of a flowing river? ♪ ♪ And this brings me a new change ♪ ♪ Shall I sing a song with you Like a cuckoo on a tree? ♪ ♪ Or can I dance with you Like a moving doll? ♪ Sharan. -Hmm? What do you think? -About what? Shall we go to Kashmir next month? We got a continuous break after some years of hardwork. What do you think? Let's go. I want to go to this trip. How can you be sure of next month's vacation? If we prepare our financial statements this month, we will be free next month. Why do we need to make those statements ready now? What's wrong with you? We wanted to consider that Mumbai company's merger offer. Your still thinking about that. We will benefit more if we merge with that company, Sharan. Why are you thinking about that? Plan for our wedding first. What do you think it means? Of course, it's a good deal. We have to think about it. We will not get a chance like this again. -But not now. Leave it now. Let's decide after marriage. I don't know. I just can't believe this. How are you not bothered about this big opportunity? This merger will change our lives. You know that, right? Harika, please. I don't like merging. I don't want to talk about it. I said we'll decide after our marriage. I have been observing you. Why wait until after our marriage? What is wrong with you? Why are you behaving so irrational? Are you okay? I mean, you are freaking me out. I understand. Do you want to tell me something? Are you okay? Why are you nagging me? I too am a part of this company. I do have an equal right. I don't like merging. I don't want to talk about it. [phone ringing] Aparna! -Harika, listen. Hello. -Ma'am. Listen to me. -Aparna... Ma'am, it's important. -Aparna... I'm busy. I'm busy right now. I'll call you back. Harika, let me explain. Explain what, Sharan? Aparna, I'll call you back in sometime. Ma'am, please. It's emergency. - Cut the call first. Let me explain. -Tell me, Aparna. Our salary cheques bounced and many of the vendor cheques may also bounce. Harika, disconnect the call. -WHAT? What? -Yes, ma'am. How can our salary cheques bounce? I'm unable to figure it out, ma'am. -Let me call you back. Cut the call first. Let me talk to you. How can our salary cheques bounce? It mean, we can't pay this month salary. How can ₹50 lakh bounce? -It's... We already have budget for 9 months! Harika, let me explain. -Explain what? What happened now? Just calm down for a bit. Calm down? Are you fucking crazy? How can you say "calm down"? How can cheques worth ₹50 lakh bounce, Sharan? That's what I'm trying to explain. I took ₹4 crore from the company. I had some personal commitments. What? What did you say? You took ₹4 crore? What do you mean you took ₹4 crore? How? Wait a minute. How can you make such a commitment without my knowledge? What have you done with that money, Sharan? I kind of messed up, Harika. I bet on cricket matches and lost ₹1.5 crore. I invested ₹1.5 crore in shares to cover that. But I lost that too. I even lost the remaining ₹1 crore. I know I lost them, but I know I can manage. Just calm down. Manage! What is all this gambling and shares? What did you do? How can you lose ₹4 crore? Oh, God. Are you mad? Harika... How did you issue cheque without my authority? Didn't you need my signature? Did you forge my signature? God damn it, Sharan! Answer me right now. Did you forge my signature? -Hey... I forged it. I even bought this ring with that amount. Why didn't you ask me while I proposed marriage in the Maldives? I know that I lost the money. I even wanted to take ₹6 crore more. So what now? So... You wanted to marry me for that surety? You proposed in a lavish way and promised me for that damn surety? So that you can blackmail me emotionally when your truth comes out? You did all this because you may go to jail if I file a case against you for forgery. That's why you need this, right? -Harika... That's the reason you want to discuss it after marriage. Isn't it? -No... No... Answer me. Yes or no? Just answer me right now. Yes or no? -Cool down. Don't you dare touch me. Harika, I'm really sorry. I didn't expect this! Harika... -Okay, Sharan. Please... Please stop talking. I'm really sorry. My lawyer will talk to you. I have to bloody fix this. Harika, please. -You're disgusting. I beg you, Harika. Please don't file a case against me. Our company will also get affected. Please, Harika. I'll leave this company if you want. You handle this company. I'll resign now. Please. Seriously? I never ever thought that you are such a jerk! You don't feel even a little guilt for ruining my life and career. Harika... Had you told me about this ₹4 crore earlier, I might have found a solution. It's like-- -You played with my feelings. I'll not forgive you. From tomorrow morning, you should not be seen in my office. Now, get out of my house. GET OUT! Harika, let bygones be bygones. Leave all that. Think what to do next. One of my friends offered a job to Harika in Canada. I think it's good for her now. There's no need for a job or Canada. Let's get her married this year before Sharan's matter comes out. Mom, I don't want to get married or want a job. Why don't you guys leave me alone? I'll handle my life. Why don't you speak to her? She won't care about what others will think about us? I don't care about others. Harika, come and sit here. Tell me what to do now. Mortgage this house, dad. Please lend me ₹2 crore. I promise I will return it in a year. Shut up. I'll slap you if you talk nonsense. You want to mortgage this house. Isn't this enough for you? Why all this now? She's already hurt. It'll be fine after some time. I'll talk to her. No one should talk about this. I don't know what to do, Dad. I didn't even realise my mistake. I wanted to gift this house to you after your marriage. Why will I object for using this for your growth? I will arrange the money soon. I tried for six months to save my company. Business went down and I was unable to pay the wages. I realised that it was not right to use the mortgage money. At least they'll get their wages if I sell my company. That's why I sold my company today. Today I don't have other option and I don't know what to do. I don't know how to face my family. I'm a failure. You know, to be honest... I decided to commit suicide today. -What a stupid decision! Falling down doesn't mean you are a failure. You can get back up again. You've a story atleast. I don't even have a story. My sorrowful life is dedicated to this bar. What sorrows do you have, man? You're happily drinking here. Hello, madam, not everyone who laughs is happy and not everyone who drinks is sad. It's a virtuous cycle. What's your problem? Is it your girlfriend or job? Or anything else. Does it mean I'm free if I hold an empty glass? No chance at all. I live my life king-size. You wait here. Do your interview well. We will party tonight if you get selected. Wine? There's a new wine shop near our house, and they give many discounts. Will you have wine or beer? Whatever... There should be good stuff, and chicken is compulsory. Oh, wicked guy, control yourself. What is this before your interview? I asked you to concentrate on your interview, not on wine, dumbass. You select from wine or beer. -Go away. [humming] Oh, no. Sorry. Hey, talk to me. -Please come down. Why should I come down? -Pratyusha is here. Pratyusha, huh? -Yes. Sorry. What is she doing here? I don't know, you idiot. -You are the idiot! Just talk to me. She's coming this way. Mr. Tarun. Tarun. -Yeah. Please come in. They are calling me now. Say sorry if possible. Harsha. -Hi, Pratyusha. Sorry about what happened. Do you remember me? I didn't forget you. I remembered when I saw you. So, what are you doing now? -What should I say? Don't cook up stories. Are you jobless? Well, it's kind of something like that. It's okay. Everything needs time. -Yes. Shall we meet again? Are you free tomorrow evening? Tomorrow evening! Don't act smart. We're meeting tomorrow. 7567773063 is my number. Ping me. Okay? -Okay. I'm leaving now. Bye. -Hmm. Bye, Pratyusha. Hey. -What? I got selected. -Really? Super. Where is Pratyusha? She was happy to see me. I thought she'll beat me. Didn't she? No, she talked very nicely and wants to meet again. Everything will be good if we talk about liquor daily in the morning. Hi, Harsha. How long have you been waiting? For half an hour. Half an hour? Sorry I was late. -That's fine. It's only half an hour. I don't have anything to do. What will you have? Whatever. I'm not particular about food. Why are you pouring water that way? Oops, sorry. Okay, I'm ordering cold coffee. Excuse me. Two cold coffees please. -Okay, ma'am. Thank you. So, what else? Sorry. Why? I wrote a letter during our farewell party and kept it in your bag. I don't know whether you read or it not. I got scared as there was no response from you. Oh, you didn't forget that incident? Sorry. -You... I searched for you later. You left and I dropped by, thinking that you're not serious. Really? Did it happen like that? But why did Tarun tell me to run away, saying you'll beat me after reading the letter? Waste fellows will speak like that only. Yes, even I'll call him that. You mean, you liked me then? Please leave quickly or the cold coffees may get hot. Sorry, sir. Now tell me. Did you like me then? You left before I gave my answer. Then what about now? What is this, Harsha? How can I say that after meeting you just once? I need time and I'll tell you after meeting for multiple times. All these girls are same. They'll decide after meeting a couple of times. And you'll be done before they decide. Stop blabbering. I won't listen to you this time. No matter what, I won't listen to anyone this time. Go to hell. Hello, what's up? -Stop speaking about social media... and ask her hand for a lifetime. -Shut up. What's he saying? -Nothing. He's a waste fellow. Aren't you sleeping? I want to eat ice cream. Shall we go? I'll be there in 10 mins. Fine. Excuse me. Can I know where you are going? Just asking. She wanted to eat ice cream. -What? She wants a icecream? And you are buying for her? Do you remember? We used to laugh at people like that, and now you're becoming one among them. You're jealous. I'll get you one too. Amigo, I'm not a child to eat chocolates or icecream! Got it? Get me liquor when you return. Give me money. Why will I ask you if I have money? I can get my own bottle. Get me with your money. I ran out of cash. -Ask Pratyusha. It won't look good. If you don't get me a bottle, I'll drink your blood. Useless fellow. I thought that you will take me to Cream-Stone or to some other big parlour. You will feel good eating here. Try a Cornetto. Fine. Mister, one Cornetto, please. Thank you. You said the taste is good, right? Why aren't you trying? I'll not eat now. -Why? Do you have any other plans? -No, no. What do you think of me? Do you think I'm a drunkard? Tell me. Do you consume alcohol? I tried vodka during college, but I puked. I stopped drinking Sprite also. How do people drink? Yuck. Thank God you're not a regular drinker I thought you became like Tarun. He's a useless fellow. Even I tried to change him. Some people won't change. Pratyusha, I need to tell you one thing. I don't how to say it and how you will react. It's okay, Harsha. Carry on. Even I want to talk to you. That's why I called you for ice cream. For privacy. -Okay, then, you say it first. You continue as you started first. I don't know how to. You won't break our friendship right? I won't. Tell me. Can you lend me ₹ 5,000? I'll repay you when we meet next. How can you ask for money when you go for ice cream? Poor you. Lack of information. Will I ask if I would have known? My mind was full of worries because of that Tarun. Maybe if I had a job, I wouldn't have such worries. Maybe Pratyusha would have been with me. Can I ask you something? Please don't mind.. -Hmm. You could have done any job. I mean, why do you sit idle? Atleast for Pratyusha. -I'm not jobless. How many days will you be idle? Aren't you ashamed? Even Pratyusha left for the same reason. Do something. Even I have dreams. It's waste to tell you. She left me because of you, not because I'm jobless. What, me? -Hmm. Yes, anyways it's a waste talking to you. You won't encourage me. -I won't encourage you? Me? You? We are childhood best friends. Tell me what you want to do. I'll help you. Don't bother about the society. I'll help you in fulfilling your dreams. Get lost. I won't. -Please tell me. I want to become an actor. Stop joking. We are discussing a serious matter. I want to become an actor. -Stop joking. I really want to become an actor. -What, are you nuts? I'm done. Do you know how many people are roaming in Krishna Nagar for ages? Half their life are wasted. Even yours will be the same if you go. Please understand. No one will watch you even if you act in Avatar as a side character. Stop it. I knew that you'll say this. That's why I don't tell you anything. What sort of friend are you? My bloody life! -He's not listening to me. We are just drinking partners. We always think about drinking only. Do we have any other goals apart from drinking? Have you ever thought about my future? But acting! -I'll become an actor. I'll act. It's decided. Again the same. I became a miser and got a cheap brand. I should have got a costly brand. You're talking like this. I don't know what to do. -Even if you encourage me or not. I'll become an actor and it's final. Don't you want me to be an actor? Is it wrong to grow through hard work? Anyways, your problems are world's greatest problems. But my goal is a big joke to you, isn't it? Stop it and continue your story. Did you continue your acting career? Sir. -Hmm. Files. -Hmm. Sir. -Hmm? A guy is waiting outside since morning. I think he wants to become an actor. He's not listening to us. It's been days now. He's been doing this every day. Raju, isn't there a thing called an "audition"? Yes, sir. Do you have recite everything to me? Go and tell him that. He wants me to meet him urgently. There is no value for director. Hey... Hey you. You. Come here. Come. What's your problem? -I came for a chance. Give me your details, okay? -Yeah. Okay. What's your name? -Harsha. Age? -24. Height? -5 feet 10 inches. Did you get your photos? -No, sir. You don't have your photos? What have you been doing here for 4 days? I want to meet Mr. Kiran, and I'll wait for him. Sir won't come here. You tell me what the matter is. I'll come tomorrow or the day after. Tomorrow! I'll inform him. Sir, he's not listening to me and not leaving even after audition. Oh. He wants to meet you. If you recommend these guys again, I'll rip you alive. -Sir. Get me tea. -Okay, sir. Wait. When is Ravi leaving? -End of this month, sir. and he won't stay even if you ask him. -Huh? He said that we can learn a lot, if we work for a lighting technician. Are these his words, or are you exaggerating? He said it sir. Sure? -Sure, sir. Confirm? -Confirm, sir. Can he work as an assistant director? He came to be an actor. Keeping him under you. No, sir. Let him go, sir. Am I that horrible? Yes... No, sir. You guys don't have money for food, but you have plenty of outdated dialogues. Fine. Call him in. -Okay, sir. Not now. After 10 mins. -Okay, sir. Will she demand ₹10 lakh? Sir, she's good. -Will you go to Mumbai? Did you observe the talk? Next month, we are planning for a pan Indian movie. We'll fix it after getting the dates. Okay sir. I'll take your leave now. Thank you sir. What do you want? -I'm your fan sir. I got inspired by your movies. I feel lucky to sit infront of you. Did you do any short-films or webseries? Yes, sir. I also do YouTube videos and reels. I have more than 2,000 followers in Instagram. Oh, 2,000 people! Will you check? -No. We can check rice by checking a single grain. Yes, you're correct, sir. Anyhow, you have a fire in you. You got it right rather than that Tarun. Fire. -You said it, sir. FIRE. Sir, here's the fire. What? Did you come to lit the cigar or me? -Sorry, sir, I came to lit the cigar. What did I say about the fire? -Me, sir. I'll make you a big star. I'll make you famous. Yes. Till then work as an assistant director with me. Sir, I came here to become an actor, not a director. Who do you think assistant directors are? Nani, he was an assistant director. Ravi Teja, he was an assistant director. Siddharth, he was an assistant director. In Hindi, that Dhawan... -Varun Dhawan. Yeah, Varun Dhawan. Hrithik Roshan. They all became actors after working as an assistant directors. You are a mixture of all those. Like Nani, like Hrithik, and now Harsha. Done, sir. Thank you very much, sir. I'll join today itself. I'll pay you ₹7,000 per month. Who am I? -Director. No. I'm the captain of the ship. -Oh. I'll make you reach heights. It started there. My bloody life. I thought he'll teach me work, but he made me his slave. I saw many things from then onwards. It's my damn life.

Now, tell me how my life was good. You could have left the job. -I thought about it... but my hope didn't let me. He may have changed his mind after I left the job. That's why I became his slave. Don't worry, Harsha, just wait. You may get a break through. You are so confident about my life. I like it. You look so hopeless after boosting my confidence. I don't like it. No, I'm not. I'm just thinking. We just live with a hope about tomorrow. But we don't know how it'll be. -That's the magic. Will we do our work today if we know about tomorrow? It's all a matter of our brain. We go mad if we think more. Actually you're right. Just imagine. Being like that is also a boon. It's like boarding a bus which goes to an unknown destination. It should just travel. Okay Harsha. I'll ask you one thing. Tell me the truth. There's nothing to hide in my life. You can ask me. Did you never feel like dying? To die! Why should we die? We will be alive only if we wake up after our sleep. Or else we would be dead. Why control life which isn't in our hands? We may win a lottery tomorrow. Or Mani Ratnam may offer me a chance in his film. Who knows? I won't die. I don't know what I'll miss if I die. Don't give me ideas like this. Seriously, you know. I really want to be like you, Harsha. We have to accept what we have without tension or stress. Life is so limited, Ms. Haarika! I'm not saying philosophy, but it's really limited. We have to do whatever we want to do. We shouldn't bother about defeat as everyone in the world cannot win. Someone somewhere will be defeated. Losing isn't wrong. Giving up is. You're not lost. You just found a hurdle. You're getting confused on hurdles and a defeat. Should we do whatever we want. Yes do it. Easy-peasy, I'm with you, aren't I. I want to visit Kashmir. -Go. Will you take me? -Are you kidding? No, let's go for sure. You won't remember this by tomorrow morning. Am I so drunk to forget all this? I just want to follow my instincts. I mean, look. I just want to go without planning. I didn't go till now. Today, I'm free from everything as no one can stop me. I asked you because I like your company. If you don't want to come, then fine. I will just go by myself. Aren't you daring? We just met 3 hours ago, and you want me to join you. I wanted to die but came to this bar at a stranger's suggestion. I don't have the patience to judge a situation. I just... I just want to be free. All I need is a break. A little freedom. Ms. Harika, don't always speak about death. It's scary. I'm going Harsha. And it's upto you to come or not. ♪ My breath turned back to me When I felt the early snow ♪ ♪ The sky handed its support To give me life ♪ ♪ When I feel the cool breeze I got a call from my dreams ♪ ♪ They put my past in a bag And threw it away from me ♪ ♪ For your wish ♪ ♪ Why does there have to be limits? ♪ ♪ This world itself ♪ ♪ Is all yours ♪ ♪ Let's roam the streets Of clouds ♪ ♪ Let's make a journey On the waves of your dreams ♪ ♪ I wonder where my happiness went ♪ ♪ I began looking for that In my every step ♪ ♪ I found it in myself ♪ ♪ Experiencing the cool, breezy wind That tickles my ears ♪ ♪ You changed me with your chant And that fills me up with happiness ♪ ♪ I'm here ♪ ♪ To make you win ♪ ♪ And to change your heart ♪ ♪ Let's roam the streets Of clouds ♪ ♪ Let's make a journey On the waves of your dreams ♪ ♪ Now I feel the light in me ♪ ♪ Wings of hope in my dreams ♪ ♪ I got 'em now And I'm flying ♪ ♪ And I'm flying ♪ ♪ You can be what you dream to be ♪ ♪ Within yourself is your magic key ♪ ♪ Let go of fear Believe in yourself ♪ Thanks, Harsha, I don't know what I would do without you. You made me realise what life is. Actually, I wanted to thank you. I might have missed a lot, if I didn't come here. I might have died 3 days ago. I went to a bar and came to Kashmir with a stranger. I'm doing whatever I wanted. I have become brave now. I might've been dead if I didn't come to the bar that day. Death is not the solution. Just think about your dad who supported you since your childhood. He trusted you instead of others and helped you start your own business. Your soul will be at peace after your death, but did you even give a thought about him? And then, do you know what those people will say? They will criticise him for not listening to them. His sorrow cannot be measured. It's worse than hell. You might face more struggles. We have to face them instead of running away from them. As far as I know you, you're not one to run away. Promise me, Haarika, that you'll never lose hope. Promise! You'll look good if you smile heartful. Harsha. Sorry. Harsha. Our car will come by 2 p.m. It'll be good, if we reach the airport by 5 p.m. Yeah. I'll get something to eat. The number you are trying to call is currently not reachable. What is this, Harsha? Are you the one I spoke on the phone? How did you do all this, Harsha? I don't know what to do. I feel like dying. Then die. Get drunk and enjoy your last few hours. Where are you now? -At the hotel. Wonderful. Which hotel? Hotel Radisson. There might be bar over there. -Maybe. Listen to me and go there. You'll not regret this. I'm sure. Get in. Aren't you coming, Harsha? No, Harika, I want to stay a few days here. I like this place. When will we meet again? -Why should we meet again? Will you repeat this mistake? I'm just a passing cloud. I just came as you were in need. Now your focus should be on your future and also how to stand again. But not to get attached emotionally to me. You have to win again, Haarika. That's your priority. Okay? Bye. Bye. Dad... I will get a job. I'll search from tomorrow. I'll definitely get a nice job. I'll clear the debt within 3 years. Do whatever you want, but not to clear our debt. Do it only if you like it. Dad? -Yes. Can we fall in love again if we get cheated once? Why? Do you like anyone? -I don't know, but he taught me how to live. Did you tell him? -I'm scared, Dad. Tell him immediately, if you really like him. If we hesitate, we may lose our love. Tell him, dear. Hi, Harika. Hi, Praveen. I need to talk to you. I came home as it's better than talking over the phone. Hope you don't mind. No, it's okay. Come in. -Thank you. Sit down. Yes, Praveen. We want you back, Harika. What do you mean you want me back? I sold my company to you. All of these clients are because of you. The company's success is because of you. The clients want to back out after you sold the company. That's why we came to a decision. You run the company and we will offer you 50% partnership. Operations and decisions are yours. We will help and support you financially. You wanted to merge with the Mumbai company. We will get bigger companies for the tie-up. You run the company. Thank you Praveen. Thank you. Okay, Harika, I'll leave now and wait for you in the office. -Sure. Thanks. We'll back in a minute. What are you doing here, Harika? You shouldn't worry about me dad. You should be happy like this. My precious! I thought that I'm done and can't face you again. Babygirl, you're not lost. You just fell down. Falling down isn't defeat. Not trying again is defeat. You're not lost. You just fell down. You're getting confused, that's it. Ma'am... Ma'am... Please come in. These are the pending files, ma'am. I'll prepare the auction budget once you review it. Okay, I'll send them. -I'm happy to see you back. Thanks Harsha. -Ma'am. What happened, Harsha? I'm not Harsha, ma'am, I'm Sreekar. Yeah, Sreekar.

You? I'm Harika, Harsha's friend. -Oh. Please come in. Yeah. Please. Please. You? -I'm Tarun. I'm Harsha's friend. You are Tarun? I know about you. -About me? What did he say about me? -That you work at a software company and you drink too much. -Oh, gosh. Those are all lies. I'm an assistant director. Do you know about the famous film director Kiran Kalyan? Then it's your story. I knew about that too. Where is Harsha? -Why are you asking me? You met him, right? -I met him 2 months back. I got this address after a lot of struggle. You don't know where he is? No, isn't this the address. Harsha left here an year ago. One year back! Where did he go? You really don't know where he is? What are you talking about? It's okay. I'll tell him that you met me. No, something's wrong. Tell me. Nothing. Tarun.. I tried really hard to find Harsha. I struggled a lot to get this address. I'm tired, please tell me. I need to meet Harsha. Please tell me what happened. Please... One second. Please, Tarun. He's a photographer. He loved photography. He started a studio with his talent and hardwork. Vijay. -Sir. Move that light. -Okay, sir. Use that backdrop. -Okay, sir. Okay, perfect. Ready, Shanaya. Pose. -Yeah. Perfect. Thanks Shanaya. -You're welcome, Harsha. Let me see. That's wonderful shot. I'll try something new this time. Yeah. -Yeah, sure. Nice. Vijay, prepare for the next set-up. -Okay, sir. What happened sir? You're bleeding. I'll come, you go. Harsha, what did the doctor say? Nothing, Pratyusha. Don't worry and relax. Why did you tell her? -How can I when you're like this? Won't I worry? Did they conduct all the tests? -Yes, we are waiting for the reports. Sir, your reports are in. You may pay the bill. I'll pay the bill. You let me know what the doctor says. Take care. -Okay. Sir, come inside. The doctor is calling you. -Come. I checked all your reports. Generally, we won't discuss this with patients. It's okay, Doctor. Tell me. We've detected cancer, Harsha. There was cancer developing in his body for a long time. We didn't get any hint of it. It's a stage four leukemia. Inshort it's a terminal stage blood cancer, Harsha. My treatment will just reduce the symptoms but won't fight the disease. No, Doctor, there must be something we can do, right? Can't we try in other country. No, Pratyusha. -Some country may have the treatment. Please. -Doctor, are you sure? I'm fine. Is it that serious? I even took a second opinion. If I could do something for you, I would have told you. I'm helpless. Pratyusha. What is this? Pratyusha, stop it Calm down. I'll be fine. Pratyusha never left him. She took care of him as if he is an infant. What are those pills? Lamotrigine. They are anticonvulsant pills. They use it for heavy depression or bipolar disorders. Bipolar? What the hell are you talkng about? Pratyusha is fine. She's fine now. May be she's taking it to be normal infront of you. But, it's a very powerful medication. I don't know at which level of depression she is. Why be depressed? I can't change my fate and I'm okay. What happened to her? Why be depressed? -What do you know about depression? It may be a normal thing, but more than 10% of the population in the world is suffering with this. Do you think it's a small number? It's a serious mental health issue, Harsha. More than 90% of the suicides are because of depression. Most of them are impulsive. They take decisions in one or two hours. Our brain acts too strongly. We have to handle it very carefully. Do me a small favour, Harsha. Only you can do it. Give Pratyusha a goal. Ask her to start something. Ask her to do something. It's the only way to make her better. I'll treat her and will make her change. Okay. Why did you get me here? -Come with me. Why, Harsha? -Just a small photoshoot. Go and stand there. Photoshoot? What's with that now? Why would these photos for me? Stand there. It's been many days since you took a photo. Pratyusha, ready. Pose. Turn right. Chin up. Just lovely. Smile. Smile, dear, smile. Is it a smile? How should my Pratyusha smile? I'm smiling. Isn't it visible. I used to show them this pic \to tell them about smile. As your smile will be heartful in this pic. But now, I'm showing this pic to you. That is smile, not this. I can't handle this, Harsha. The thought of you being away from me is killing me. I want to die, Harsha. The thought of your absence is killing me. I can't live without you. I love you so much, Harsha. Calm down. Come with me. This is my life. My passion. The empire which was totally built by me. Doing a tons of hardwork, its here now. And most of the credit for my success goes only to you. I want to live, Pratyusha. But I can't. I don't even have that option. But you have it. What did you said? You said you want to die, right? We will be alive only if we wake up after sleep. Or else we would be dead, right. Don't ever let that thought strike into your brain. From now on... this is yours. This is your responsibility, and my dream is also your responsibility. You have to smile, all the time and also you have to be busy all the time. Harsha, you did great job by giving your studio to Pratyusha. She's the right one to fulfill your dreams and goals. And I'm the one who left. What are you talking about? God gave me a great boon. Do you know what that is? No one knows till when they'll be alive. But, I know. That's why I took a decision. Hey, you are freaking me out. What? -I want to go. I got scared looking at Pratyusha. Good, I spoke to her. Or, she would have done something. That thought itself is killing me. There are many more people out there who don't know with whom to share their feelings. They are killing themselves. That's why I want to do something for them in this short span of my life. You mean? You will go? Will you say goodbye to our friendship here? How dare you say that? We started our childhood together. We faced many hurdles. We did everything together, right? No, I won't accept this. Bud, do whatever you want. I won't say no to anything. But, I'll be with you, bud. Let me stay with you in these days, amigo. Please. I'll get lonely after that. Please, buddy. No, mate, I have to do this on my own. You guys aren't controlling yourselves. How can you see me later, buddy? No, I don't want that sympathy. I don't want to lead my last days in selfishness. There are many people killing themselves for very small problems. That should be changed. In this effort, if I able to save one life, it is enough for me, buddy. [sobbing] Take care of Pratyusha. Take care of yourself. Thanks. He left that day and now you have come for him today. Which mean he is reaching his goal. He won, ma'am. Why are you here? That too in morning. You are drinking though you don't have a habit. I got it. You are a love-failure, right. Harsha. I love you, Harsha. I really love you. Where were you? Are you crying? The most famous Harika Varma is crying. Very bad. Why do these things happen to me only, Harsha? Why? What happened to you, Harika? Nothing was happened. You are an inspiration to so many people. Inspiration! No. What you did is a really great thing, Harsha. You are inspiration. Not me. You are giving hope to many people, Harsha. Me? What can I do? Just running away. I'm a coward. You came to Kashmir with a stranger. And you again went to Kashmir for the sake of that stranger. You still don't know how to utilise the fire in you. All you know is to attach emotionally. No, Harsha. I want to marry you and I want to change this world with you. But how will I know if you leave? Who said I'm leaving you? Wherever I go, my ideology will be present here, and you have to take charge of that idea. Will you take that forward? Will you do this small favor for me, Harika? Help? Just ask me. I'll give my life to you. I have to born again to save your life. Save your one and only life. I trust you. It's yours now. Take care, Harika. Harsha... Harsha. Today's headlines. A 19 year-old student activist, Nikhil, attempted suicide because a girl rejected his love. What's your opinion on this? Student activist? Is it a job? And you guys are supporting that? Instead of cutting nerves, I prefer to cut heads. -Is that so. What you say? -To hell with opinions. Study first. Parents will feel bad about all this. Just study first. What do you say, sir? -Talk with him first. Do you get that? Will she come back to him if he does crazy things like this? See, they will talk like this. You became so famous with this incident. Suicide is not a solution. Who knows? You may win a lottery on tomorrow. The one who said no to you, may come back to you by seeing your fame. Who knows. Look... We will be alive only if we wake up after sleep. Or else we would be dead, right. Why control life which isn't in our hands? Then? -Sorry, sister. I won't repeat this again. Promise? -Promise! Just don't do it. -Okay. Take care of yourself, okay? Don't do this again. ♪ I have given you my heart ♪ ♪ My every breath is a prayer ♪ ♪ O fate, what do you know? ♪ ♪ The winds of change, are blowing now ♪
