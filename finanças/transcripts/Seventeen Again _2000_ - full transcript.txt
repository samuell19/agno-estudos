(upbeat hip hop music) (man scatting) (upbeat hip hop music) (upbeat hip hop music) (alarm blaring) - Yes! (dramatic music) (Gypsy barks) Right on time. It worked, Gypsy! (Gypsy barking) Good afternoon, guys. All right, I've downloaded your equations and I've processed it into my hard drive. The roses are in the bucket, so if all goes well, this formula should keep them from aging, right? - Technically, it should. But I still think you didn't use enough- - What are you talking about? I have told Willie the exact amount of everything. My plants are living for 40 times past their usual lifespan. So, Willie, you try it out. - I don't know if I like the color she used. - Mrs. Donovan, that looks beautiful. And I love your hair. That style really suits you. - You can call me Mom. I already told you about that. - (sighs) All right. Here goes. (machine beeping) (machine whirring) (fluid gurgling) (dramatic music) - You don't think this makes me look like one of those wanna-be-young grandmas, does it? - Oh, no, Mom. I don't. - It is absolutely beautiful here, Barry. You picked a wonderful place to live, son. - Yeah, Monique and I, we love it. - Guys? You didn't say anything about smoke. - Willie, the smoke will not harm you. It is just white, odorless smoke. An indicator you used too much formula. Now you must stop it before you lose visibility in the room. - Okay. - Mom, this, um, interest that you have in the way you look, it wouldn't have anything to do with Dad coming into town, would it? - The creature? - Is Miss Thing staying at the house? - If you mean Mom, yes, she is. - You see, that's on you. You could've told me that she was coming. I'd have rearranged my trip! - So self-absorbed! - Honestly, whenever that man looks into my eyes, the only thing he sees is himself! - I mean, she is really something. She can be the biggest pain in the behind that I have ever seen. You know it. - Are you gonna be able to get through this? - Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil. For thou art with me. Thy rod and thy staff- - Oh. Willie, whatever you do, don't use water! - Well done, Herr Accreditation. Perhaps you should have warned Willie about this beforehand? - [Scientist] No hair? You ought to talk about hair. (scientists bickering) (Gypsy barks) (steam hissing) - Oh! (suspenseful music) (Gypsy barking) ♪ There was once a place and time ♪ ♪ When I thought you cared for me ♪ ♪ Yes, it's true ♪ - Willie? - What do I do? Willie? (dramatic music) (Gypsy barking) - (coughing) What did I do wrong? (bell ringing) (dramatic music) (dispatcher chattering) (siren blaring) (Gypsy barking) Gyps, where are you? (siren wailing) (dramatic music) - [Woman] Where's the fire truck? It should be here by now. (Willie coughing) - [Willie] What have I done? Oh, man, I'll be grounded for life. (siren wailing) - [Woman] Oh, and it's a new house, too. (siren wailing) (Sydney sighs) (dramatic music) Whoa. (coughing) (glass crashing) What are you guys doing here? - [Firefighter] It's all clear! Got one over here! - Get off me! You're gonna ruin my experiment. - [Firefighter] It's okay, son. Just relax. - [Willie] No, you don't understand! - [Firefighter] All right, let me get you out of here. - No! - Got one! I'm coming out! (Gypsy barking) (mysterious music) (Gypsy barking) (dramatic music) - [Willie] Come on, guys. Please! Just a little bit more time. Guys, why'd you do- - You should do it more often. - [Firefighter] You okay, kid? - [Willie] (sighs) I'm fine. - [Firefighter] Can you take a deep breath for me? - [Willie] See, look. I'll show you. - I think he's okay. Thanks, guys. Hey, kid, don't play with the truck. Sit. What's your name, son? - Will Smith. - Now let me guess, you were just getting jiggy with it in the garage? Now, your real name this time. - I live here. This is my house. - [Firefighter] Excuse me, sir. Sir, you can't- - Willie! Willie, are you okay, son? - Yeah, but they messed up my experiment. - False alarm. - I'm sorry. - What did you do? - Hey, grandpa. - Come on, let's go assess the damage. Leave you two alone for half an hour, and this is what happens? Where's your sister? Sydney! - Dad? Dad, what is this? - [Barry] Where have you been? - What? I was upstairs, and all of a sudden, I see this smoke every... What did you do? - What do you think? - What? Oh. Hi, Grandpa. I am so sorry. I didn't even see you. - There's my beautiful granddaughter. (laughing) It is amazing. You are the spitting image of your Grandma Cat when she was your age. Of course, you're a lot more level-headed. - [Sydney] (laughs) Thanks, I think. - No, no, don't get me wrong. On the outside, she's still beautiful. But sometimes the inside can effect the way you look on the outside, and your grandmother's insides are twisted and mauled and all around wrong. And the way her brain works, I mean, the logic she employs is like, on another level altogether. - [Barry] Dad. - What happened? - Is everyone all right? - Everyone's fine, Grandma. - Mr. Einstein here was working on another one of his experiments. - Oh, Willie. How many times have I told you to pay attention to what you're doing? Honey, you're playing with dangerous chemicals here. - I thought I was being careful. - No, you weren't. Now, until you learn to take much more responsibility, your lab equipment is off-limits. Understood? Do you understand, young man? - Yes, I understand. - Okay, let's get things cleaned up. - What, what? Me? Oh, no. Uh-uh, I have to go. I mean, I'm already late for work. Why don't you let him do it? It was his fault. - Well, wait, wait. You're gonna come home early, though, right? I'm making a family dinner. - Yeah, sure, sure. Just make sure there's no meat. I don't eat meat. - I know, I know. - Bye, Dad. Bye. - I'll make you something special. Oh, my goodness. Look at this mess. Willie, oh! What have you done? (smooth jazzy music) Willie? Willie! I think it's best you get the soap box and bring it upstairs with me. - Should I go now? - I think it's best you do. - We're not finished yet. You are grounded. - Take it easy, Barry. (Cat sighs) You gonna ignore me all week, Cat? - How can I? You're in my face. - No one asked you to come here this week, you know. Man can't even visit his own grandchildren? - They're my grandchildren just as much as they are yours. - Yep. Same old bitter woman. - Looking at the same old selfish man. (dramatic music) (Gene sighs) (suspenseful music) - [Monique] Willie! Don't forget to put fresh soap in your grandparent's bathroom! (dramatic music) (upbeat music) - (giggling) Busy afternoon? - Busy? Maybe for this burg. You don't know busy until you've seen the stores in L.A. That's busy. - (groans) Well, Brad says you're catching on fast. - Hey, I'm from California. We do everything fast. - (giggling) Sydney, look, I know you miss L.A., but there's a lot of cool things and people here, too. - Mm. - Yeah, come on. Give it a chance. You'll see. I'm telling you, I can feel it. It's in the stars. Yeah, oh, yeah. I can feel it. The moon and Venus are aligning. Oh, yeah, oh, yeah. Mm-hmm. Yep, I feel it. Strange and wonderful things are gonna take place. Oh, oh, oh! - What? - Oh, do you recognize him from computer class? - [Sydney] Yes. (gentle music) - Holy jumping, wow. You can e-mail me anytime, baby. Oh! Oh. - Mm, mm, mm, girls! (record scratching) You musta wished upon a star, because tonight is your luckiest night by far. - Oh, please. - Oh, my- - So, seriously. - Oh, my god! - Girl who is so funny, how'd you like to roll with Mr. Milk and Honey? - Milk and honey? - Oh, yeah. - Are you serious? - I do not joke when it's matters of the heart. - You know what, um, my shift's over. So I will see you later, okay? Call me, Julie. - Yeah, my name's Terrence, but that's cool. We'll get that later. So your friend, she seems to be taken with me. - Oh, taken with you, is she? - You know what I'm talking about. - Yeah, I know what you're talking about. I'm talking about this right here like that. You know? Okay. Can I get a price check, please? (crickets chirping) (clock chiming) - What ya doing there, kiddo? - Oh, hey, Grandpa. - What's up? - Well, since I can't use my lab set anymore, I'm using my computer to do virtual experiments. - Ooh, quite the little scientist, aren't we? - A bad one if you ask anyone around here. - Oh, then I guess you won't be needing this. - What is it? - Open it up. (chuckles) - Whoa! A real, authentic scientist lab coat! Thanks, Grandpa! - (laughs) That's for inspiration. You're a very talented young man, Willie. Once you're off your grounding, you can wear that thing, but not before, okay? And listen. You got the right attitude. You're young, you've got your whole life ahead of you. You've got plenty of time to do what you have to do. Okay? And remember one thing: Grandpa loves you. (gentle upbeat music) - Grandpa? I love you, too. - Heavenly Father, we ask you to bless this food we are about to consume. Please help it to nourish our bodies to do thy will. And, Father, we ask you for special blessings for Barry and his family in this wonderful, wonderful celebration we are having right now, Father, for those who were invited and for those who were not invited. Some of us need more prayers than others. We ask you, dear Lord, to bless this food. In Your name, we pray. Amen. - [All] Amen. - And you were referring to- - So, how do you like your new town, Sydney? - Oh, well, um, you know those old black and white films that we see on TV? - Mm. - Well, they're years ahead of this town. (Gene chuckles) - Kids. You've got to love them, Dad. - Yeah, right. - No meat, right? - Right. - Moo. - You'll make new friends, honey. You've only been in this school for two weeks. You must make this experience a positive one. - Grandma. - Hm? - This place is so not me. - Yeah. People here are nice. - Dad, please. - Willie. - Sorry. - Honey, you're still gonna try out for the cheerleading team, though, aren't you? - Well, yeah, I guess. I mean, I was good when we were living back in L.A., so- - Hey, it's a good place to meet people. Especially the boys. - You're new here, pumpkin, and it just takes time. Remember, the mountain didn't come to Mohammed. Mohammed had to go to the mountain. - Your grandmother's right for a change. You've got to go after what you want, sweetheart. - Right for a change? - Oh, my bad. Your grandmother's right for the first time in her life. - Listen, Mr. Thinks-he's-so-hip, you're such a fool! - Well, it takes one to know one. - [Cat] I don't know how they put up with you. - Well, I don't know how they put up with you. (phone ringing) - I'll get it. - I don't know why I even bothered to show up here. I knew you would be nothing but trouble. - Believe me, if I had known you were coming, trust me, I wouldn't have. Talk to the hand. (kids laughing) - Oh! - Jenny's in labor! (laughs) (smooth jazzy music) - I cannot believe you are leaving them to watch us. - What's wrong with that, honey? - They hate each other. - Willie, they do not hate each other. We had no idea this was going to happen. Aunt Jen wasn't due for, like, three more weeks. - She's never been early for anything before. - Well, I guess we better hide the kitchen knives. - Look, I promised your Aunt Jen that I would be there for the birth of her baby. And we did the best that we could. I'm sorry. - Baby, you seen my- - Yes, second drawer. Where did I put my eye cream? Honey, don't forget your sinus medicine. Now, what, oh, yeah. Need my deodorant. - Hey, Dad. Dad, why do you always jump when Monique says jump? I mean, if Mom was here- - Hey, that is not fair. We've been over this time and time again. Hey, baby, look at me. When Mom died, it was the worst day in both of our lives. We've got to move on. Monique is my wife now, and she is your step-mom and she loves you. - Yeah, but you never have time for me anymore. It's always her. - Sugar, don't say that. We're only going to be in California for a couple of days. I tell you what. I promise you that when I get back, we'll spend as much time as you want to spend together. - Promise? - I promise. (gentle music) - All right. All right. All right. But, I mean, if you guys are only going for a few days, then why is Monique packing a month's supply of shoes? - [Monique] Ah. Woo!

Breakfast is ready! - Okay, I'll be right down. Whoo! Better hurry up, guys. You're gonna miss your flight. - I can't believe that Mom isn't up yet.

I can't say that I do. All right, let me see some ID. Give me your driver's license. - Okay. (Gene scatting) There you go. - This your car? - No, no, no. This is, uh, this is my son's car. I just dropped him and the missus off at the airport. - All right, step out of the vehicle with your hands in the air. - Is this one of them speeding traps? - Now. - Yes, sir. Drop your keys. Slowly. - Look, officer, couldn't you just give me a speeding ticket? - This is a lot more serious than a speeding ticket, pal. Where's the guy you stole this car from? - Look, this car is not stolen. I told you, it is my son's car. - Yeah? And it's pretty obvious that- - Back off! Freeze! I didn't tell you to move, punk! We're gonna get to the bottom of this. - I sure hope so. - [Dispatcher] Attention, all units, we have a code three. Please respond. - You stay right here and don't move a muscle. Yeah, this is Officer Ratto. I'll deal with your code three. I've got a situation here. I want you to run a license for me. - It's a miracle. - [Ratto] Yeah, I'm having a problem with a kid. 17-years-old. - Or I'm going crazy. - I got him on a speeding ticket. Yeah, the car's not registered... (smooth jazzy music) Hey. Hey! (radio chattering) (upbeat music) (tires screeching) (suspenseful music) (Gypsy barking) (Gene panting) - All right, Tracey! That was fabulous! Thank you very much. That was good. Okay, um, Sydney Donnelly? - Donovan. It's Sydney Donovan. - Right. (dramatic music) (upbeat techno music) - Aw, yeah. She's pretty good. (upbeat techno music) (Sydney panting) - How'd I do? - You was banging. I mean, you were real good. - Hey, excuse me. You're the new girl, aren't you? - Yeah- - Well, you've certainly got a lot of potential. Maybe with a little more practice. - Practice. - Who knows? - I don't. - It was a very good first try, though. Maybe next time. All righty, I'm sure we'll see each other around school. Who's next, Kim? Kim Anderson? - Yeah, yeah, just hold on. - Kim Anderson. - [Kim] Coming. - Next. - Ash, I don't get it. What didn't you like about her? - (sighs) I smell an attitude problem. Major. - Yeah, so do I. (huffs) - Next. - Yo. I saw what happened. You cool? Aw, man. Well, if it's worth anything, I thought you was all that. Seriously. I think Ashley made a mistake. She's my sister, I'm gonna talk to her right now. - Look, look, I don't need your help, okay? I can take care of myself. - You know what my coach is always telling me? He says you're only a loser when you give up. I don't think you're a loser. Why would you want to do that? You're real good. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Well, obviously not good enough. (people chattering) Look, I'm sorry, I- - Hey, baby. You miss Daddy? Listen, we gots to stop meeting like this, because people are starting to talk. - Oh, my god. - Yeah, that's right. So, girl, I know you needs me, but I'm real busy right now. - You know what? You need help. - Yo, keep it down, girl. No broadcasting. - [Student] Hey, you got a sister? - Sydney. Y'all should be in school. - What's that? - What's that, lady? - [P.A. Announcer] Good morning, Monarch High. Today's announcements include a follow-up to our detentions. Will the following names please report to- - Girl, he is cheatin'! You know, I stop-- So what's up? You trying to get down? - Uh, down? No. I'm not down. Well, I am a tad bit upset. You would be too if you were having the morning I was having. - Shut up. - Shutting. - Are you dissin' me? - Uh-huh, she dissin' you, girl! - Serious dis. - Look, I know you probably had a rough day. You probably failed an English test of something. (laughs) - You want some of this? - Okay now, young lady, that is enough. Nobody puts their hands on me. You should be ashamed of yourself. All y'all. Instead of focusing on your studies, something that could make your pathetic life worth something, you around here acting like some common criminal. I know your mother did not work her butt off so you could go to school acting like this every day. Now, I am in the middle of an emergency. And the next time I see you, you better be acting like the young lady I know you can be instead of some hoodlum. You understand? (blow thudding) (toilet flushing) - [Sydney] Was it me? No, it wasn't me. (sighs) (sighs) I hate this town! - Oh! (panting) (bell ringing) - Can you help me with this? Came loose. - Your brain's what came loose, fool-child. You need to go home and thank the Lord your mommy and daddy haven't kicked you out of your house. Looking like the devil himself. You need some help. Oh, sugar, honey, iced tea, not again. (student laughing) When did kids get so violent? - [Sydney] That sounds like something my grandma would say. - Sydney? - Grandma? - You? Something's happened. Oh, this is big. - (gasps) Who the? - It's me. Grandma Cat. - What? - I can't believe it myself. But here I am. - What? Oh. Oh, my gosh. - Oh. Ooh! - [Sydney] Willie! - [Willie] What? - [Sydney] Will you hurry up? - Why are you late? - Just get in the car, okay? - [Willie] What's up with you? - [Sydney] Just get in the car. I cannot tell you about that right now. - Who's the freak in the front seat? - Don't you call me a freak just because something weird happened to me. I'm your Grandmother, boy. - Grandma? - Did I stutter? - Grandma Cat? What happened to you? You look like Syd. - Yeah, well, guess what, Mr. Scientist, we know that. - Stop it! - Tell us something we don't know, okay? - Oh, wow, Grandma. Have you been in my stuff? - Of course not. - Oh, wow, Sydney. We've got to hurry up and get home so I can run some tests on Grandma. No wrinkles. - [Cat] If you touch me one more time, I swear I'm gonna smack you upside your head. Sit back. - Yes, ma'am. (upbeat music) (Gene chuckles) - Yo, I can't believe you left a brother out to dry. - Well, see, what happened was I was going to go from behind- - I don't want to hear your fables, Judas. Man, you should have been stickin'- Hey, dude, watch out! - Whoa! - Damn. Oh, boy wrecked my ride. - Yo, man, you 'aight? - Yeah, I'm cool. I'm cool. But this guy needs some crazy medicine. - Yo, let's see if we can get him up and bring him over to the store. - All right. (door knocker rapping) (upbeat music) - [Ratto] Good afternoon, young lady. Your parents home? - Uh, no. They're away on a trip, officer. Grandma! Can you turn that down, please? (laughs) Can I help you with anything? - You have any adult supervision around here? - That would be me. - You're her twin. - Her twin? - Twin. - I'm her grand- - My twin. Such a kidder. - I stopped a young kid this morning driving a Ford Explorer registered to a Barry Donovan at this address. - Dad's car? - Is Barry okay? - Well, we'll know better when we find the kid who was driving. Maybe he can shed some light on things. - Kid? - Yeah, about your age. He was carrying this driver's license. - Wait a minute. What did this kid look like? - About six foot, wearing gray slacks, gray trench coat, black fedora with a red feather on the side. Do you know him? - That's your grandfather. - Grandpa? - Grandpa? (Gene groans) - Yo, check it. Mr. I'm-Gonna-Go-50 In-a-20-zone is comin' to. Word. - Oh. - Oh. - What happened? - What happened? Oh, what happened? I can't remember what happened. Leo? - I don't know, let's see. What happened? - Oh, I remember what happened. You knocked me flat on my back, sucker. - I did? - Yeah, you did. - Yeah, you did. Where you coming from? Damn. - I saw what happened. Are you okay? Is there something I could get you? - Yeah, I'm- - Well, well, well. If it isn't little Miss Gold Digger. - Now, look- - Oh, hey, hey, hey. C'mon now, young fella. That's no way to be talking to a lady. - Young fella? - That's no way to be talking to a lady. - Mm, mm, mm. (sighs) Barbecue spare ribs, macaroni and cheese, and jalapeno mashed potatoes. - (scoffs) Um, Grandma? Aren't you overdoing it? - Well, that's what we're about to find out. See, these are foods I used to eat when I was young. Man, I haven't had spicy food like this in 10 years. I haven't had dairy products in five. Lactose intolerant. Mm. Mm, mm mm. Just as good as I remember. - Grandma, I've checked all the prescriptions and lotions that you use. There doesn't seem to be anything that could've caused your transformation. Now, think. Did you use any bit of this soap? - (scoffs) Wait, soap? Great, Einstein. What do you want us to do, take a bath? - Well, that's the soap in the bathroom? I used it. - Syd, would you just listen to me for a sec? - All right, I just don't believe it. You're gonna have to explain it. - This bar of soap was in the box that my chemicals spilled all over yesterday. I'll have to run some tests to see if it's contaminated. Yesterday, I put it in the grandparent's bathroom. - So Grandpa must have taken a shower this morning using the same soap. - Maybe when the chemicals mixed, it created some kind of fountain of youth effect. The chemicals got in their bloodstream and... - [Willie And Sydney] Instant teenage grandparents. - No indigestion? No upset tummy. - Can you reverse the process? - I don't know. I just figured out how it probably happened. - (sighs) All right, all right, all right. Just do your best, okay? And just do it before Monique and Dad get home. - Wait, does this mean I'm not grounded from my lab equipment anymore? - Willie, I am giving you permission to use whatever you need, okay? Just be careful. And hurry. - Cool. - Funny guy. Mr. Funnyman in a hat. - [Leo] Hold on. She's writing something. - Yo, that dude's got game. He's a female magnet. Yo, I think we's gots to be rolling with him. - I hear that. - I sure hope Grandpa's okay. - I'm sure he's fine. Just don't expect him to come around here anytime soon. - Why not? - Because he's selfish and irresponsible. And if he's 17 again, he's gonna want to do it all over. No strings attached. - Listen, new guy, you stick with us, because we are the serious players up in this one. - Serious. - Serious players. - Word up, look. We'll turn you into a mack daddy lover, just like us. - [Leo] Yeah, what you say? - Well, I- - Come on. - I don't know about all that. - [Leo] What's the deal? - You all live around here? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Okay. (upbeat music) - See, Gypsy? It's just another bath. See, I'm gonna get you all clean. Good girl. (Gypsy whining) (Gypsy barking) (gentle music) - (chuckles) Woops. - You look great, Gram. - Aw, thanks, baby. - Can I ask you a question? - Anything, baby. - All right. Um, what happened with you and Grandpa? (Cat sighs) - Well. (sighs) Well. Hmm. You mean, why'd we divorce? - Yeah. I mean, Grandpa, he's so... He's so young and he's so fun and so hip. - Your grandfather's a fool. - Well, then, why did you marry him? - Well, he wasn't always that way. He was a good husband. Faithful. A good provider. - Then what happened? - (sighs) I don't know. But enough about me, Sydney. You're young. You have a great life. You live in a wonderful town. Why do you hate it so much? - I just do, Grandma. I mean, I had such a great life in L.A. I mean, there's so many people and everyone there, they're so alive, you know what I mean? Everyone's so boring here. - Everything and everyone? There isn't one thing you find the least bit interesting? - No. (gentle music) (door clicking) - Welcome to Casa de Terrence. - Okay, okay. Now, where are your parents? - My parents, I don't, working, I think. Paying the bills, you know. - You lying, man. I thought you said they were on vacation. Like in the motherland, or something. - Man, I don't know. Maybe they're upstairs. Why you buggin' me? - Yeah, uh, where's your telephone? - Telephone, yeah. Right there. Help yourself. - All right. I love your house, man. You always got food. - [Terrence] Yo, straight up. My parents is providers. (smooth jazzy music) So, did you see how many phone numbers I scored today at the mall? Huh? - [Leo] Huh, you mean Gene scored. - [Terrence] And did you see how the honeys was peeping me? - [Leo] Hmm, you mean peeping Gene now. (phone ringing) - [Terrence] Look, they was only peeping Gene 'cause he was hanging with us. Check it, the honeys see us teaching Gene- (Gene growls) So, if we hang with him, we could have all the honeys in the world. - All the honeys? - Like a buffet. - Like a buffet. - That's what I'm talking about. So what you say? (smooth jazzy music) (Gene laughing) So, what you say? - I don't know, man. It's like... You know I'm down for that. - You kidding, man? Bam! - You a genius! - We gonna be bangin'! You know what I'm saying? - You're a genius. - Yeah. All right. - What? - So, where you staying at? - Well, I was gonna stay at my family's house, but it looks like I'm gonna have to stay at the Holiday Hut. - [Both] The Holiday Hut? - No, no, no, brother. Why stay at the hotel-ay when you can chill right here with the fell-ays? - That sounds like a plan. Yeah. That's what I'm talking about, yeah. (Gypsy whining) - Gypsy! Gypsy, it worked! You're a puppy! See, I told you I wouldn't do anything to hurt you. (laughs) It worked! - Willie, I'm going to scho- Who's puppy? - It's Gypsy. See, I needed a test subject so I could see how to reverse the aging process. And it worked! - All right, I'm counting on you, Willie. Now, I'm letting you stay home from school today, but you have got to change Grandpa and Grandma before Monique and Dad get home. All right? - Okay. - Be careful. Bye, Gypsy. - Gypsy, we've got a lot of work to do. Let's get to it. (people chattering) - [Server] There you go. - This is very upsetting, Todd. - I really think you're overreacting. - Really? - Yes. - I am days away from putting on the first major dance of the senior year, and you tell me the DJ that you scheduled has suddenly pulled out? I am class president. Class icon. Monarch High It girl. For God's sakes, you know that. - Now, if you would just listen to me for one second, I can- - The dances that I have put on for the past three years have become the stuff of legend. The Senior High School Dance must be the pinnacle of my high school career. - That's why me and you are gonna strut ourselves down to the Orange Club. We're gonna check out that new local DJ 'cause I hear the boy can spin. So you don't have to worry about it, 'cause your brother got it covered. - Well, why didn't you say so? So, Todd, who are you taking to the dance? - I don't know. I was kind of thinking about Sydney Donovan. She cute. - Whoa, rewind. Same question, new answer, please. - Same answer. Sydney. - Todd- - What? - No, I cannot have my brother dating the new girl. - Okay, now you've totally lost me. What's wrong with Sydney Donovan? - She doesn't fit in. Plus she hangs with that loser girl. - You talking about Julie? - You know her name? - Yes, I do. (laughs) - Plus, you don't even know this Sydney. You just met her. - That is the exact reason why I'm taking her to the Orange Club tonight, okay? Honeybun, let me tell you something, okay? You may be my big sister and all, but you's got to learn to stay out of my business. I still love you. Go on. - Yeah. (people chattering) - Hey. - Grandma! I don't think this is a good idea. - I'm young again, Sydney. I want to, I want to experience life. At least until Willie finds out how to turn me back. - Yeah, but how am I going to explain you? - Look, tell people that Oprah helped you find your long lost cousin. I love that Oprah. Remember that time that woman socked that other woman? It was crazy. Wait a minute, that was Jerry Springer, not Oprah. - All right, all right. All right, all right. But I gotta warn you. School's probably a lot different than how you remember it. - Honey, please. It's still reading, writing and arithmetic. How much can it change? (bell ringing) - This is a condom. It is a latex condom. And we place it over the head of the fully erect turgid penis. We roll the condom down the shaft all the way down to the base. Now, upon withdrawal, holding on to the base of the condom, we easily slide it off like this. All right, class. Now it's your turn. (Cat gasps) (hand thudding) - Shh. - How do you turn this thing on? (computer dings) Oh. - [Computer] Wassup? - I'm fine. - (laughs) Grandma, it's a computer. - It was talking to me, so I answered back. (upbeat music) (computer beeps) (alarm beeping) Oh, oh. - Shh.

That's my boy, yeah! - Hi, I'm Ashley. Great performance. - Well, thank you. Thank you. Um, I'm Gene. - Some friends of ours are going to the Orange Club tonight to listen to some bands. I was hoping you'd like to join us. - Oh, we're gonna have to check our calendar, girl, but I'm sure it'll be just fine. - It's not an open invitation, geek. - Talking to me? Yeah, I'm gonna sit right back down. - Gene? - (gasps) Oh, my gosh. Grandpa? - Gene? - Well, um... - Yo, my man, you've gotta make this move right here. I mean, this is a major hottie, you know? I'd do it myself, but, you know, I'm gonna hook you up. - Oh, you know what? I've gotta get to class. Um, can I trust you to get Grandpa Gene and meet me back at the house after school? - Yeah, yeah, sure. I've got this under control. - Okay. - You just go to class. - So you go and do your thing. - Mm-hmm. Okay, yeah. - Great. And you know, listen. - Gene! - Sydney! - No. - Cat? - Blow away. We're busy. - Well, go get busy with some other fool, girl. 'Cause I need to talk to this one. - [Terrence] That's what I'm talkin' about. - Excuse me, child. - I'll get out of your way, girl. - [Gene] Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey! I didn't know it happened to you, too. - It was the soap we washed with. It got contaminated from the chemicals in Willie's lab. You would have known that if you would have called home. - Whoa, hey, Cat, Cat. Look, look, look. You know what? Hey, I was planning on doing that. But, you know. - Well, Willie's working on a way to get us back normal. - What? Why? I like things just the way they are. - What? - Cat, look at us, Cat. We are 17 years old again! Look at this! - Oh, Lord. - Hey, feel that. - I don't want to feel nothing. Aren't you at least a bit concerned with what's happened to you? - Hey, I am 17 years old again, okay? I don't care how it happened, I'm just glad it did. - There might be side effects, Gene. We don't even know how long this will last. - Which is why I'm going to ride this thing out as long as I can. I, I mean, why should I waste my energy trying to turn back into a 67-year-old man? Constantly, constantly being reminded of my age with every step that I take. You know what that is? - What? - Booty. - Booty? - Booty. - Will you listen to yourself? Who are you trying to fool? We don't fit in with this generation, Gene. And I don't care how young you look or talk, you will never fit in. - Oh, oh, you, you know why I haven't been home, Cat? There's your answer, right there. - You know what? This is really sad. (chuckles) You finally look the way you've acted your entire life. 17 years old. - Well, I'm going to stay 17 years old, you old woman. - Fine by me, you old man. Do what you want to do. - I am gonna do what I want to do, and you know what? I don't need your permission to do it. (Cat groans) - [P.A. Announcer] ROTC training takes place at 4:30 tomorrow afternoon right behind the south gym. - Sydney! Sydney! - What? - Um, I was wondering if you'd like to go out with me tonight. Look, there's this place, it's called the Orange Club, they've got all these DJs I want to check out. - I'd love to go out with you, young man. - [Todd] Would you, now? (chuckles) Well, all right, then. Look, I'm gonna see you tonight. (bell ringing) I'm feeling good, brother. (door thuds) (people chattering) (blows thudding) (men grunting) - Oh, oh! Take advantage of a brother. Living off kritz, baby. Look at this. Wassup? What you got? - Ready? - What you got? Too slow. You're too slow. Come on. You can't even catch what you can't see. - Boom! - Look at that. Boom! - Hey, fellas. Hey, hey, fellas. Homies, hey! - Right in the belly, and you know you got a big one. - [Gene] Hey, my, my bloodhounds! My dog pound, what's up, what's up y'all? Hey, hey. - Come on. - Stick and move, baby. Stick and move. - My, um. - You're too slow. You're too slow. - All right. - Don't you two, you know, want to get out of the house? Maybe go and do a little something? - Come on, man, you're messing up my combo. - Yo, what's up, G? - Man, is this all y'all gonna do? - You ain't got me. - You know, you play your video games and watch your music videos. - Uh, other than chasing hotties, what else is there? - What else is there? Man, there's life out there, man. - Boom! - The pulsing- - Pushing right out of the move. - Beautiful, unexplored, delicious life! - I'm gonna sit you down, fat boy. - Out that door, waiting for you to taste it. - Hey, I'm up for some grub. How 'bout some Taco Hell? - Naw, naw, naw. Domino's, dude. They deliver. - True dat, true dat. - [Terrence] Hey, come on. Look at that. - [Leo] Cheap shot is the one. Man, lose the frown lines, dude. You got a date with a hottie tonight. So what's the problem? - [Terrence] Hey, pause, man. Stop cheating, man. - Yeah. - Dang. - I've got a date with a 17-year-old hottie. (blows thudding) (men grunting) (bell ringing) - [Terrence] I didn't want to play anymore, so that means you lost. - So, what happened at school today? I miss one day, and I feel like everything's changed. The stars are aligning, Sydney. I'm telling you, the universe is in flux. - Tell me about it. Yeah, I mean... What's wrong with you? Your voice is generating unstable biorhythms. - (sighs) I don't know. It's just that my grandmother, right, she came into town and I'm just trying to get used to the changes that we're going through. You know what, I better go. It looks like my grandmother needs my help. - So am I gonna see you at the Orange Room tonight? - Well, I don't know. - Well, Todd will be there. - Yeah, and so will a lot of other local boys. You know what, I have to go, okay? I'll just talk to you later, bye. (dial tone buzzing) (Julie sighs) (phone rings) - Oh. Psychic friends hotline. No, Dionne Warrick is not here, thank you. - You look great, Gram. - I do look good, don't I? Mm. I can't believe it. I'm finally going on a date! Me! - Relax, Grandma. It ain't no thang. - Well, maybe it ain't no thang to you, but if the last time you went on a date was to see the new singing sensation Nat King Cole, trust me, baby, it is a thang. (Sydney laughs) - Whatever. (bright music) Ooh! Big Mama! Look at you! Now, you look fabulous. - Thank you. I have arrived. Now, if your grandfather can have fun, why shouldn't I? - (laughs) You know, Grandma, I can not believe I'm saying this, but you have become one of my best friends. - Well, let's just hope you feel the same way once I'm an old woman again. (both laughing) (doorbell ringing) That's my date. - Ooh, right on time. That's a good sign, Grandma. So, which Monarch High guy is lucky enough to be going out with my 67-year-old Grandma, huh? Todd? - Sydney. How you doing? - (gasps) Oh, my God. What is he doing here? - That's my date. - No! Grandma, no! No, you cannot- - Of course I can. - No! - Now look. I am not gonna toy with this 17-year-old boy's heart. Now, move. - No, no. Grandma, no. (knuckles rapping) - You like this boy. (Sydney sighs) Baby, now- - Grandma, that's okay- - No. No, it is not okay. Now, look, he obviously thinks I'm you. (sighs) All right, I'll go with him to the Orange Club now- - Grandma! - Hey, hey, hey! After you get dressed, you just hustle on down to the Orange Club and when the time is right, we'll make the switch. - I cannot believe you. No! I am not gonna do that! - You got any better ideas? (knuckles rapping) - No. But I also don't have a dress that looks like that in my closet. - But you do have something short, black, and clingy. Now put it on. - No. - And if he notices the difference between those two outfits, you had no chance with him anyway. Now, what do you all say? Audi 2000? - No, we say one. - One? - We say one. - What do you say? - One. - Well, I'll see you later, okay? - Bye. - Bye. Hi, Todd. - [Todd] You get dressed fast. Didn't I just see you in a sweatshirt? - [Cat] I'm from L.A. We do everything fast. - Where have I been? L.A. (dramatic music) (car honking) (people cheering) (upbeat music) And here it is, the hottest spot in town. Everybody comes down here, gets their groove on. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. - Hey, what's up, Todd? - All right then. You know? Cool? What, Ashley? Don't worry about Ashley. Let's, let's go over here, lounge. - Whoo, girl! - Yeah. - [Woman] All right! - [Woman] You got it. - Oh, hey! My gosh! (both laughing) Hey, Sydney, what are you doing here? I thought you said you weren't coming. - When did I say that? - An hour ago on the phone. - Oh, oh. Well, here I am. - There you are. You look great. Oh, man, so, hey, have you spotted him yet? - Who? - The man of your dreams. - Yeah. - Yeah? - I think I have. - [Todd] Here we go. Hope I got something you like. - Todd. - How you doing, Julie? - Hello, what brings you out this evening? - I'm here with her. - Oh, you're here together? - Mm-hm. - Oh, you're here with, oh! Sydney. I couldn't quite figure out what he was at first. Then I realized, holy cow. (laughing) - Oh, well, well, well. If it isn't the loser sisters. - Sydney? - [Cat] Guess again, lover boy. - [Gene] Cat. What are you doing here? - Just ignore her like I'm trying to do. - What am I doing here? What are you doing here with her? - He's my date. I mean, just how well do you know her? Did you go to school with her before you came here? - Oh, yeah, we went to the same school. The school of Holy Matrimony. - You know what, you're not only desperate, you're psycho! - Excuse me? - Ho, ho, ho, hey! That is enough. - Come on, baby. Let's go dance.

You look so beautiful tonight. - Oh, you mean because I'm young, Gene? - No. No, no. The truth is I, I always think you look beautiful. You were right, Cat. I mean, I, I just been fooling myself. You know, just pretending to be something that I'm not. God, I, I miss you, woman. I miss you. (gentle music) - This isn't real. This isn't real. - Sure it is! Cat, I, I love you! - I know. You've always loved young, new, and exciting things, Gene. - Cat, for as long as you have known me, is that what you think? - Just like you loved that job in Australia. - Cat, that was, that was over 20 years ago! - For you, it was over 20 years ago. But I have lived with that job in Australia every day of my life. (gentle music) (gentle music) (people chattering) (door clicks) (Sydney sighs) Sydney. You're still up? - Where have you been? - What do you mean where have I been? - All right, I was worried about you, Grandma. Todd has called, like, 15 times. - Oh. - And, you know, by the last call, he figured you ran off with Grandpa Gene and just left him at the Orange Club. - Look. a lot of stuff has happened tonight- - I'm not finished, Grandma. See, um, Todd thinks you're me, okay? Which pretty much blows the small chance that I have ever had at dating him. You know, I really want to be mad at you, Grandma, but I can't. - Oh, baby, I'm sorry. Look, I know what you're going through. - (scoffs) What makes you think you understand, huh? Because you've been 17 for two whole days? - I was 17 once before, young lady. - Yeah, a long time ago, Grandma. You don't know what it's like living today, trying to be as pretty or as thin as these, these models in these magazines, or as hip as these women in these music videos or trying to live in this stupid town filled with stupid little people. No, you don't understand, Grandma. You don't understand anything. - Okay, you're right. You're right, Sydney. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have assumed that I knew what was going on inside of you. - Yeah, Grandma, like that means anything now. I know you're sorry. You're always sorry. And you know what? You always say things you don't mean. And you know what, Grandma? I have to say this. I really do. You chased Grandpa away. And you know what? Now, you're chasing Todd away from me. (huffs) (smooth thoughtful music) (dramatic music) (Gypsy whining) - Don't worry, Gyps. I'm not giving up on you. The answer's got to be in here somewhere. (dramatic music) (computer whirring) (gentle music) (people chattering) - Hey, new girl. Look, I don't know what that was all about last night, but if you and Gene had something going on at your previous school, which I find very hard to believe, it's over. - Over. - Look, the rules of this school is that my men are off limits. That includes my brother Todd. Loser girl knows that and now you do to. - [Friend] You've been warned. - What is her problem? - Yeah, and my name's Julie. (bell ringing) You know, just like an M.P.G.I.S. chick. - What the heck is that? - Most popular girl in school. (people laughing) (upbeat hop hop music) I still think that you should go to the dance tonight, because if you don't, Ashley will think she won. - Yeah, but I'm not thinking about Ashley. - But you're thinking about Todd. Oh, you guys had such a good time last night, and, well, right up until you ran out but. - Julie, I have to tell you something, okay? Can I trust you? - [Julie] Yes. - Okay, listen. My little brother accidentally made a formula that makes people young and my grandparents got exposed to it. See, now they're our age and that was my grandmother last night, who looked exactly like me when she was my age, but now she is my age, so she looks like my twin. That's who ran out with Todd last night because she was trying to make my Grandpa Gene jealous while making out with Todd, only I ran in and saw everything and now we're not speaking to each other. - What? - (sighs) Oprah helped me find my long lost cousin and she was the one who ran into the club last night with Todd. Not me. - Oh. Oh! Well, why didn't you just say that? Jeez. Gosh, you know. Oh, my goodness. I, what are you gonna do now? - I don't know. I just have to, you know, get my head together. (Sydney sighs) - Julie. - Yeah, that's my name. You guys are identical. That's uncanny. I didn't even need my tarot cards to tell me that. (chuckles) Well, I think you guys need to talk, and I'm gonna go, so, can you lock up for me? - No, no. Julie, I-- - Thank you. Bye. (Sydney huffs) - Sydney. - What? - You know, I spent the entire day sitting in the park thinking about you. - (scoffs) Please. - And you're right. I did chase your Grandfather away. It was all because of this, this job in, of all places, Australia. Your grandfather wanted to go so bad. But I was afraid. New people, new places. I was afraid of a change, but I couldn't tell him he couldn't go. So I told him he could go alone. And that I'd follow him. - And did you? - No. (Sydney sighs) I never intended to. But I convinced myself that if he loved me, he'd come back. And the next thing I know, I'm, I'm filing for divorce, something that I have always regretted. - I'm sorry, Grandma. I didn't- - It's okay. (gentle music) - [Sydney] You still love him, don't you? - Very much. - Well, Grandma, why don't you just tell him? - That's what I intended to do. But Sydney, everybody's afraid of new places. - I'm not afraid. - Oh, girl, please. You sound like somebody I used to know long time ago. Someone who let fear and pride keep them from the one they loved. You remember that time I told you to make this new experience a positive one? (gentle music) (sighs) I'm afraid I haven't been taking my own advice. - Yeah, but, Grandma, this, this is different. - Is it? Baby, don't make the same dumb mistake I did. Now, if you like this boy, you better tell him. - How? - At the dance tonight. (sighs) Now, let's go get our men. (both laughing) (Gypsy whines) (upbeat music) (water whooshing) - Come on, Gypsy. (Gypsy whining) - Oh, I got mad love for myself. I just want to jump back, kiss myself. Look at that. Mm. - Can you see any growth? Can you see any growth? - Whatever, y'all. Look at me, babe. - [Terrence] Please, guy, you've got to ask? - Leo] I'm ballin'. I'm ballin, look at this. - [Terrence] You frontin', guy. - Player. - Hey. - Player. Oh, my. Oh, my. Why, why? - Please, go ahead, brother. - You're doing too much, my brother. - Dude, what's with this hat? You look like you're from the 1800s. I don't know what. - Look, guys. I've been thinking. You know, this life, it's not for me. But I want to thank you guys, you know, for helping me out. It's been fun. - Dude, come on. Lose these frown lines, will you? We're your boys. For real. Together forever. - Ta-da! - Hey, hey, hey. I'm never gonna forget about you two. - Well, how could you? Look at us. Come on. - True dat, true dat. So my man, what are you saying? Are you leaving? I mean, you can't bail on us now. We need you for the hotties to stick around. - That's true, we do need you, bro. - Look, fellas, life is not all about the hotties. You know, maybe when you're young, it is. And when you're young, youth is fine. But there's nothing wrong with growing up. (gentle music) Understand? - Come on, man. Come on. Please, man? - [Terrence] Don't go. - Hotties, hotties. Hotties. - [Terrence] Three of us, we could get something together. - You heard what I said, okay? I gotta get out of here. Now take care of yourselves, all right? - Take care of yourself. - Whatever. Whatever. (door clicking) Man. (door thuds) Your man got problems. I mean, what the heck did he mean it ain't all about the hotties? It's all about the hotties. - True dat. Bam! That's what I'm talking about. (Gypsy barking) - Gyps, you're okay!

(Ashley gasps) - Hi, Grandpa. - Hey, baby. You look gorgeous. - [Sydney] Thanks. - [Ashley] (muttering) Out of my way! - Look, Cat, we have to talk. And I'm not taking no for an answer. - No is the furthest thing from my mind. ♪ I'm curious ♪ - Maybe you could, um, explain this to me over a dance? - I'd love to. - You would? - Yeah. ♪ I can't wait till my tomorrow ♪ - You know what I've been thinking about all day? - What? - Australia. - Look, I'm sorry about last night. - No, no, no. You were right. I mean, I've been selfish over the years. Only thinking about myself. I should have come home instead of giving you that divorce. - No. I shouldn't have asked for one. I'm sorry. - I let you get away, woman. I've had to live without you for 20 years. I'm going to let you know something. I'm never letting you go again. - Neither am I. (Cat gasps) - [Gene] You okay? (Cat groans) - I feel like a 67-year-old woman. (panting) - Cat? Oh my God, Cat. Cat, hey. Hey, baby! Hey, somebody, get some help. - Give her some room. - Get some help! - Oh, God. - Somebody call 911. - [Sydney] Grandma? - [Gene] Come on, talk to me. What are you doing? Go get some help, boy! - [Todd] Give her some air, guys, back up. - Grandma! Grandma, are you okay? Syd, look, I've got the antidote right here. We need to get her in a tub of some type of water right away. - The pool! The pool, come on, let's go. - [Julie] Where? - [Gene] Come on, let's go. Let's go. - Where do you think you're going? No one walks out on me. - Hey, Ashley, this is not the time. - Yes, it is. - Move. - Or you'll what?

Okay, I'm gonna throw this in. Okay, now they have to jump in. Syd, it's the only way! - [Cat] Whoa, what, What's happening? - Willie. Willie found a cure. This is it. We gotta go. You gonna come with me this time? - Okay. (dramatic music) (water bubbling) (Cat inhales) (gentle dramatic music) - Come on, come on. Where are they?

How would you feel about a wedding in the spring? - Oh, sugar, honey, iced tea, Gene Donovan. Are you saying what I think you're saying? (gentle music) - Will you marry me, again? - Oh, Gene, I can't think of anything I'd rather do then spend the rest of my life with you. - Mm. - Mm. - Oh! Oh, congratulations. Oh, okay, I have got to plan this whole wedding. Okay, first of all, I'm gonna have to call Reverend Smith. And the florist on 34th. And Darlene is gonna have to do your dress. Oh, you're going to look so beautiful in white! - [All] White? - Peach? - Peach is good. - [Gene] Yes. Much better. - Monique. Um, I have an idea. Why don't I help you with the wedding plans? - Oh, Sydney. (laughs) I'd love that.
