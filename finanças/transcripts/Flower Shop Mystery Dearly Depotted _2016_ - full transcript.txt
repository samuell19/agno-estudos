♪♪ Morning, Abby. - Morning. - Here, let me help you. Oh, thank you. - We're now open. So is one of these coffees for me? You shouldn't have. - I didn't. They're both for me. Not to mention the double espresso I had while waiting for those coffees. - Coffee binging. Is this something we should talk about? - No. Maybe. Oh, fine. Here. - Thank you. It's called guilt. It works every time. Abby, here's to you surviving tomorrow's wedding. - Oh, let's hope there is one. - What, is there a chance there won't be? - Mm... Jillian is the family's drama queen. She's already jilted two fiancés at the altar. - Whoa. Ouch. - I cannot get stuck with 900 cut flowers. This wedding has to happen. - What are you doing? - Just taking my coat off. - What are you doing? Is there something you don't want me to see? - Taking my coat off... - Come on. Get out of the... What is this? You bought a police scanner? Didn't I hear you say you were going to stay out of other people's business? - I am. - Oh, OK. Right, fine. Would you like me to maybe install this in your car, or do you want to operate it here in your flower shop? See you tomorrow. Oh, wait, Marco! By the way... - Yeah? - So look, I know you don't know my family and you don't know the bride or the groom, or any of the guests, but one of the groomsmen -- well, actually my partner -- had to drop out, so-- - You're just wondering if maybe I could walk you down the aisle as a groomsman fill-in? - Yes. - Done. How easy was that? Thank you. - Nicky. - Hey! I brought coffee, but I only brought two. - What is with you guys? You girls are, like, obsessed with coffee. - Mm... Bye! Alright, ciao! - He seems to be finding a lot of excuses to come over here. - What? He just helped me with the door. My hands were full. - Uh-oh. - What? Oh, no. No, don't say it. - Here comes the... bride. - Abby? This whole thing was a huge mistake. I'm calling it off. - Oh, no. It's just cold feet, Jillian. Go home. Put on some socks. - What was I thinking? I've only known him for six months. - Oh, six months is a perfect amount of time to fall in love. - I mean, I don't know. Maybe I was just distracted by this big, honking diamond! - Oh, you're not that shallow. And do you remember that you told me you loved him? - Yeah, I do. - See? Oh, those two words. So you can say those two words. - I suppose if I marry him, I could always get out of it later. - There's the spirit! - Yeah, OK! Thank you, Abby. You're more like an older sister than an older cousin. - Older, close in age, whatever. Thanks! I'm so excited! - You just saved us 900 flowers. - Let's get these centrepieces in the car. ♪♪ : Quite the turn out. Is this yours? - OK. Let me check out this one, just in case. - That looks gorgeous. - Thank you. Wow! - Oh, come on. Don't make a big deal.

The flowers on table seven are wilting. - Oh! OK, got it. Bethany, this is Marco, the groomsman replacement. Bethany is the wedding planner. - It's my first wedding in New Chapel. Honestly, I don't know who is - me or the bride. Let me take your coat. - Oh, no, that's OK. I'm a little chilly. - Oh, dear. I'm going to go check on the heat. - "Wedding planner"? She does realize there's only, like, three people a year that get married in this town, right? - She moved here a couple months ago. Starting over, like me. Her husband passed away. Oh! Look who's here. - Hey, guys. You look beautiful, Nick. - Marco, you know my husband, Richard. - Yes, I do. Richard, good to see you again. Nice tux, by the way. - Likewise, my friend. - Due back tomorrow at 11? - Affirmative. - Sydney! - Hi, Mom. - You made it! - Any chance to avoid dorm food! Hi! - Hi! You look lovely. - Thank you, you too. - You look beautiful. - Thanks, Mom. You too! Where's Grandpa? - Disinvited. Evidently, there's some ancient history between him and Gloria Osborne, the mother of the groom. - History like... dating history? - Either that or he gave her a parking ticket. - You know, I was thinking I should video the flowers for the website, while they still look perfect. What do you think? - Good idea. - Let me. My face is starting to cramp up from all the smiling. - Oh! OK. Thank you. - To useful children. - Cheers. - Bridesmaids, photo please. Excuse me. Abby?

May I suggest flats? What are we waiting for? Let's get going. - Can I have your attention, everyone? The ceremony is about to begin. Can everyone please follow me into the Empress room, right this way? ♪♪ - Is that Jack Sutcliff? That guy owes me a bar tab. - Good luck with that. Hold this. I'm going to put out a fire. - Don't get burned. - So, crashing weddings now, Jack? - Just this one. I need to speak to Melanie. - Well, talk to her somewhere else. Anywhere else. - Come on. The old man won't let me close to her. - Can you blame him? - Look, I'm not going to cause a scene. I just want to talk to her. - Abby! Um... We gotta go. So did you put out that fire? - Who am I kidding? I should carry around a garden hose. - How'd he get an invitation, anyway? - He didn't. Ex-husband to cousin Melanie. - Another cousin? - Yep. Black sheep in the family with the big hair. - Got it. What's the deal with the guy with the scowl on his face? - That would be her father, Josiah. Also a black sheep. - I thought a family could only have one black sheep. - Ours has a herd. - It's a flock. - Flock is birds. - And sheep. Thank you. -: How dare you! - Get your hands off me! : Don't you ever touch me again! - I can't breathe. - Yes, you can. In and out, in and out. - Can you just step in for me? - No, because then I would be the one getting married. - What should I do? - Talk fast. - We are gathered here today to join Jillian Knight and Claymore Osborne in holy matrimony. And we'll skip the vows and ask if anyone here has an objection to this union. Does somebody have a ring? - Oh, this is it? I do. - Wow. I do, too. Wow. Oh, sorry. Thank you. - I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss the bride. - The alarm went off at the store. - OK. - What do you call a group of sheep? : A group of sheep is called a herd... - Ha ha, yes. - ...or a flock. - Oh, yeah. - Oh, OK. Alright, touché. - Lady Osborne, 12 o'clock. - She is no lady. - No, I don't want to eat that. Take it away. - Remind me never to get married in... She looks miserable. I don't get it, either. Her son married a perfectly nice gold digger. - Jillian's not a gold digger. That would require digging and Jillian doesn't do manual labour. - I'm sure, knowing my new bride's track record, many of you weren't sure this day would ever come. But it has, and I'm so thankful you're all here to share it with us.

Please tell me you didn't disturb it. - The body belongs... belonged to a Jack Sutcliff. His ex-wife was my cousin, Melanie Turner. He said he came to talk to her. She left early with her father. - I suppose you already have the murder weapon and confession? - Punch bowl. - What? - Punch bowl. The murder weapon was a punch bowl. There it goes. Well, half of it. The other half is missing. You should probably check all the dumpsters in the vicinity. Trash collection day is tomorrow. - Thank you. I believe I can take it from here. Let's keep this place on lockdown. No one leaves until I get statements. : And check all the dumpsters in the vicinity. Ms. Knight, you're free to go. Don't leave town. - My first wedding and there's a murder?! - And I'm going to need the wedding video and all the pictures. - I'll get that for you now. - Richard Bender? - Yeah? - I understand you left early, sir. - Yeah. - Um, my husband had to leave. He got a call from his store. - And when was that? - It was during the ceremony... - After the "I do's." - Yeah, after the "I do's." Look, I own a jewelry store and the alarm went off and I got a notification on my phone. -: I saw it. - I saw a case like this on Columbo.It was the groom's mother. - Whatever happens, stay out of people's business, Abby. - Excuse me. Can we at least let my guests go? This obviously has nothing to do with my side of the family. - I understand, Mrs. Osborne. I will need a statement from your son. - The only thing that Claymore is guilty of is marrying down. - That's enough, mother. How can we help? We have a flight to catch in an hour to Turks and Caicos. - I'm afraid you will have to postpone. - This is ridiculous. Claymore doesn't even know this... Sutcliff person. Although I can't vouch for her. - I know him, like, a little. - What's "a little"? - I, um... went out with him once or twice. It was before we met. Did everybody date this-- - What are you still doing here? You've been cleared to leave. - Oh, well, it's OK. We can just stick around, you know, if you need to-- - No, I don't know. I think I'm fine, Ms. Knight. Do you require directions to the coat room? After you. Goodnight. - Thank you. ♪♪ OK, that gives us three suspects so far. Oh, coffee. Thank you. OK. Hey... What's up? - The police came to our house last night. They said Richard left the wedding around the time Jack was killed. They're suggesting he triggered the store alarm himself as an excuse to leave. - Why would he do that? - He doesn't even know Jack Sutcliff. - They are desperate for a suspect, huh? Hey. It's gonna be alright. - Morning, monkey. Morning, Nick. Got your coffee. - Oh, hey, Dad. - So I missed a wedding and a murder. - And Gloria Osborne. - Oh, good thing. - Morning, all. Abby, I've got your... coffee order. - Thank you. - So why don't we get started here? Let's find ourselves a killer, shall we? : Almost forgot we have a business to run. Uh, you forgot your coffee. - Thank you. - Hey, guys. Mrs. Day! What can I do for you? - OK. What do we know about Jack Sutcliff? - From what I know, Sutcliff was a hustler. Charmed the ladies, scammed the men. - Who would want him dead? - Most of the ladies. A lot of the men. - Not me, because dead men don't pay their bar tabs. - It's motive we're looking for. Everything points to Josiah. - Or Melanie. - No, Josiah hated Jack for abandoning his daughter. - But wouldn't Melanie hate him more? - Josiah's had his share of trouble over the years. I got called to the farm more than a few times when I was on the force. - The black sheep live on a farm. No? Alright. - OK. Cousin Jillian dated Jack. Maybe he had something on her. - How could she have done it? Weren't all eyes on the bride? - She did leave the party early to check her makeup. - Shoes. - It's the same thing. - No. Shoes. Shoes. Not the same. - Dunn won't be eager to investigate the Osbornes. They're big contributors to the policemen's fund. I, however, have no such qualms. - Dad, just because she uninvited you to your niece's wedding doesn't make her a suspect. - We'll see. - OK, well, I'll go pay a little visit to Josiah and Melanie. - I'll go with you. - No, that's OK. - No, I insist. In fact, just try to get rid of me. - Tempting. - Go with her. I don't trust Josiah. I almost forgot. I need flowers. - Oh, OK. Uh... For whom? - Do I ask about your social life? - Constantly. - I'm gonna pay Gloria Osborne a social call -- something I haven't done in a long time. - There was a relationship? - A brief one. Back in high school. She was always looking for greener pastures. You know, that kind of green. So I want a flower that says, "Hey, I don't like you. You're not a good person." - Oh. That's going to be tough. - And that, "There's no chance that you and I will ever be friends." - Got it. - That says, "In fact, you're lucky I'm even talking to you." - Um, how about this? Dead, dried, but yet somehow still tasteful. - Perfect. What do I owe you? - Details. - Those aren't for a date-date? - With those flowers? If it is, I doubt there'll be a second one. - Yeah, I've been there. - I bet you have. - A police scanner is such a cool thing! Whoa! - Stop playing with it! - What? I just want to touch the buttons. - No, stop it! - Alright, alright. - 484 at Bea's Custom Gown Shop off Marsden. - Oh, 484. That's... That's petty theft. - Woo. Regular crime wave around here. - It's going to be if you don't stop playing with that. - What's going on here? I thought we were returning my tux. This is... - Jack Sutcliff's apartment. - Wow. How'd you find that out? - I saw his address at the bottom of your bar tab. - That wouldn't happen to be the bar tab he didn't pay. - Yeah, the one he didn't pay. Sutcliff, Sutcliff, Sutcliff. - Sutcliff? - J. Sutcliff. 101. - 101? OK. What are you doing? : Come on. Alright, look. It's been a while, but I used to be really good at this, so... Or we could do that. - Wow. He had bad taste. - Yeah, tell me about it. - Looks like he raided my grandma's. - I'm going to go check the bedroom, OK? - OK. Marco? - Yeah? - You might want to see this. Ah! Who are you? - The apartment manager. What are you guys doing here? - What does it look like we're doing here? - Breaking into an apartment. I'm calling the police. - Hold on. This is Detective Knight and I'm Inspector Salvare. - Oh. Is everything OK? - Ma'am... I'm sorry to have to say this, but Jack Sutcliff is dead. - What happened? - Um, I'm sorry, we can't discuss the case. - Was he behind on his rent? - No. Paid on time every month, cash. - Great. Guess everybody gets paid but the bartender. - Did he have any visitors? - Women, mostly. Although there was one girl that came around a lot. - Can you describe her? - I'm afraid I never got to look at her face. I heard some arguing, though. - Arguing... - They're thin walls. Well, then. Thank you for your time, ma'am. Sorry for the bad news. We are going to be going. - I'm sorry. That was quite the performance of a police inspector back there in Sutcliff's apartment, Abby. So what'd you find in there? - Nothing. - Really? What's in your pocket? Sutcliff had a card for R.B. Jewelry? - It's Richard's store. I'm sure it's nothing. - Then why do you look so worried? - I'm not. Let's go. - I'm guessing the next stop for Inspector Abby is the Turner farm, to check in with her flock. - Yep. And... it's a herd. ♪♪ - Abby. What are you doing here? - I just wanted to check up on you. This is Marco. Jack was a customer at his bar. - I'm very sorry for your loss. - Could we come in? - Yes, just for a minute. My father's due back. He doesn't like visitors. OK. : Hi! Your baby's beautiful. - We've both been crying a lot. - Oh, can I try? Can I? I used to be pretty good at this. There we go. OK. Oh. I used to do this all the time when Sydney was a baby. Oh, she was a screamer. OK. Oh, boy. I think I've lost my touch. - Abby, let me try. Here, may I? Oh, there we go. Oh, there you go. I have a way with the ladies. - He's a boy. - Oh. Ah, OK. That's good to know. - Would you mind if we asked you a few questions about Jack? - I've already talked to the police. - I know. I just... I thought it would be easier if Josiah wasn't here. I know that he hated Jack for leaving you and the baby. - He hated him long before that. - So had you been seeing him? - Just once, last week. - At his apartment? - He called and asked me to bring the baby over. - Did you argue about anything? - Just the opposite. He said he'd come into some money and wanted us to be a family again. I told him I'd think about it. I know it sounds stupid, but I still loved him. - It doesn't sound stupid at all. - Why'd you rush out of the wedding? - I went to talk to Jack. My father followed me and they started arguing. I insisted we leave when things got out of hand. - Did you? - Yeah. He went and got our coats. - So how long do you think your father was gone for? Long enough to kill Jack? - For all his faults, he's still my father! - I know. Come here. Come here. - Josiah! Josiah, we're just here to help. - Help who? - Whoa! Hey, hey, hey. - Help who? The police? - No, no. You, Melanie, the baby. Your family. - I can protect my own family. Just put the gun down, sir. - You got 10 seconds to get off my property. - And you got 2 seconds to put that gun down. - Marco, let's go. - Now we'll go. - Next time, it'll be loaded. - Abby? - I watch too much TV, Rambo? - Come on, Abby. Anybody can do that. Did you see me get that baby to stop crying, though? - That was luck. - Oh, really? Yeah? I tell you, that Josiah is one terrifying guy. - Yeah. And he's clearly a guy with a short fuse. ♪♪ - Hey, Abby! - Oh! Hey, Richard. Thank you so much. Come in. - No problemo. Where's Nicky? - She is out on a delivery. I didn't want to talk to you on the phone and I didn't want to talk in front of her. - What's going on? - I'm sure it's nothing, but you are my friend and you're my best friend's husband. And so if you're keeping anything from Nicky, maybe I can help. You know how nosy I am. I'm going to find out anyway and then it'll just be weird. - What are you talking about? - I, um... I, um... I found this in Jack Sutcliff's apartment. - Oh, well, I mean... - You told Nicky that you didn't know him. - Alright, look. He sold me some watches a few months ago and they turned out to be stolen. - So what, the guy sells you a couple of hot watches? - Yeah, try... $100,000 worth of watches. - That's a lot of hot watches. - Yeah. I mean, I wanted to tell Nicky. I just couldn't. I was embarrassed. I felt like such an idiot. I still do. - Did your store alarm really go off? - Yeah. Yeah, I don't... I don't know why. Look, I mean, I'm not going to stand here and tell you that I'm sorry he's dead 'cause I'm out 100 grand, but I really had nothing to do with it. - I know you didn't. - Now, um... can you not tell Nicky about this? - I won't. - OK. - But you should. ♪♪ - Promise me when I get married, you won't throw a giant wedding? - And how big is giant, exactly? - More than five people, including you and a plus one. - Oh, Bethany! - Hello! - You know my daughter, Sydney. - Yes, of course. - We met at the wedding -- which was beautiful, by the way, except for... - Yes, um, except for the murder. - Sit down, please. You can help us finish these onion rings, which we should not have ordered. - I don't want to interrupt. - You aren't.

I can't argue with you there. - And my doctor prescribed those to me after my husband died. - No one understands that more than I do. - Of course. - That's a club we didn't want to belong to, huh? - Well, I came to New Chapel for a fresh start and it seems that bad luck has followed me here.

Alright, let me work really hard at getting you a bowl of lettuce! - Onion ring? - Maybe just one? - They're really good. - No, thanks. I won't be long. - I don't appreciate uninvited guests. - I gathered that when the uninvited guest at your son's wedding ended up dead. Think of this as a social call. - I'm surprised you can afford these. - They were on sale. Perfect for you. - Lovely. You know we haven't been social in a long time, Jeffrey. - Mm-hmm. Not since you were poor. - You haven't changed at all, have you? - Thank you. - It wasn't a compliment. What do you want? - No small talk? Alright. I'll get right to it. Just like you, I have friends on the force, only I don't have to pay for mine. According to one of those friends, you made a nice contribution to the policemen's fund last year, just after you were caught shoplifting. - Ah. That was a misunderstanding. - No, that was an overpriced Louis Vuitton purse. - I have six Louis Vuitton handbags. Why would I need to steal one? - Rich people don't shoplift out of need. They do it for the thrill. - Ah. And now you're a psychiatrist? - Jack Sutcliff was a valet parking attendant at the store on the day you didn't steal that purse. - This is absurd. - Is it? Because what I'm thinking is that he was privy to that little "misunderstanding" of yours. He wanted some money to keep his mouth shut. You paid him off and then he came back for more. - Get out. - Before you throw something at me? - Yes. A lawsuit for harassment. - Good to see you, Gloria, as always. What's that old saying? Uh...

Or I could-- - Stop snooping and take the night off. And by night off, I mean you, Marco, dinner and no discussing the case. - Why would I do that? - Because I already invited him. He'll be at your house at 7. You're making your famous lasagna. - I don't have a famous lasagna. - Well, I told him you did! So just make it. And everything you need is in these bags. Oh, and wear that red dress you bought that has been hanging in your closet for months. - Is this retaliation for my talking to Richard? - Yes. : You're worse than my daughter.

You've made that abundantly clear. ♪♪ - You know what? Look at this. See that? I have to admit, I love your dress. - Oh... - I do! Whoa! Look at those moves. - Oh! Aw, the band. Isn't the band good? - They're amazing. - OK, wait. I've got to watch that again. - Yeah, let's do that. You know... I don't know about you, but I think we look really good together. - Yeah, that, that. That, that, right there. - What? - There. That is Jack Sutcliff, but who is that other guy? - Some guy in a dark tux, Abby. Which narrows it down to, what, half the wedding? - What's in his hand? - It's a lighter. - OK, wait, wait. Listen. Hold on. No. Look, look, look! - I'm looking, I'm looking. - He does that click thing, that flip with... He's flicking it open. That means it's a Zippo. Richard's a smoker. Nicky's been trying to get him to quit. I have got to enhance this. - Um, just send it to me, Abby. I'll take care of it, OK? - No, no. I can do it right here. I have a special program for that. Enhance, enhance. - Um, listen, Abby. Maybe I should go back to the bar. Help them close up. - Oh, OK. - Listen, um... You know, thank you for a nice dinner. OK? - Yes, you're welcome. - I'll... I'll see you tomorrow? Call you tomorrow? ♪♪ - Jillian? - That's what you're wearing? - It's a police station, not fashion week, and what am I doing here? - Dunn suggested that I call a lawyer, but I told him I don't need a real lawyer. I've got you! - I am a real lawyer. - I can't believe I'm missing Turks and Caicos for this. If you were running this investigation, wouldn't you let me go on my honeymoon? - I'd be happy to get rid of you! - Plus, we're living with his mom until Claymore can buy us a home. You'd be surprised how small a mansion can feel with her in it. - You. Again. - Officer Dunn. Is there a reason you haven't released my client yet? - You're practising law now? Dressed like that? - I was jogging. Look. If you're not charging her with anything, she'll be leaving with me. - As I told Ms... Mrs. Osborne here, the wedding video shows she left the reception for eight minutes. - And as her lawyer, I reserve the right to see all of the evidence that is being used against her. - This isn't a trial. - I'll just get a subpoena and you can waste a day getting into court. - I pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss the bride. - OK, right there. She's wearing $2000, gold, high-heeled shoes. Continue. Fast forward. Fast forward, fast forward, fast forward... Stop! There. There. Those are $3000, satin, kitten heels -- which proves she went to go change her shoes. - It doesn't take eight minutes to change shoes. - It does if the dressing room is at one end of an 18000 square foot banquet hall and the victim is killed on the opposite end. That is a long walk. - Maybe she ran. - Have you ever run in kitten heels? - So she took them off and then ran. - My client might be shallow and have bad taste in shoes, but even she's not shallow enough to change her shoes after killing someone. - I'll take it into consideration. - Let's go. We're done here. - Yay! Shallow? - It was the first thing that came to my mind. If the Louboutin fits... Is there anything you're not telling me about you and Jack? - Are you asking as my cousin or my fake lawyer? - Again, not a fake lawyer. You didn't see him at the wedding? - I was kind of busy panicking. - There was nothing going on between you two? - OK, maybe we went out a few more times than I said. But once Claymore proposed, that was it. - His landlady said that there was a woman that visited his apartment frequently. Was that you? - Apartment? Seriously? Ew, no. Look, I told you everything. Please promise me you won't talk to Claymore about this? - I won't, but... maybe you should. - Oh, no. He's already nervous enough without worrying about me. He already ran off in a panic to his broker twice since the wedding. Now I know why they say marriage is work. - You've been married three days. - Yeah. Thanks for being there for me, Abby. - Hey, we're family. Ooh, ow. That is a big ring. - I know. - You do love Claymore, right? - Look, I know everybody thinks that I married him for the money and maybe I did, partly, but he also partly married me despite his mother. And that doesn't mean that we don't love each other in our own way. - Clearly a match made in heaven. - Oh, don't tell me... Coffee. - Can you find out who Claymore's stockbroker is? - How about a double espresso? - He's gone to see his stockbroker twice since the wedding. - I make a mean cappuccino. - Jillian said he's extremely nervous. - I got it! Decaf. - Have you heard anything I have just said? - Yes. I have heard everything you've said, Abby. Look. The Osbornes' broker's a guy with the name of Mike Monroe. He's actually going to be swinging by here later today. Follow the money, right? Oh and by the way, it's not that unusual for a rich guy to actually talk to his broker. - During his wedding week? - I don't know. Maybe he realized how expensive it was to actually be married to your cousin. - Just what makes you think that this Monroe guy is going to tell you anything? - Because he owes me. - Bar tab? - Well, that too. We served in the rangers and, uh, I did him a little favour. - How little? - Pretty much saved his life. - Oh. Thank you. - You're welcome. - So maybe I'll just stick around a little. Listen in. - Hmm, how do I say this? No. - Well, maybe I need a stockbroker. - I'll get you his card. - Will you call me after? - Yes. I'll do one better. I will swing by. But only if you have any more of that lasagna left. What? - OK. - OK. You're looking flashy there, dude. From fatigues to suits. Thanks, Brie. It's good to see you again. - Cheers. - Cheers, to good health. - OK. Now that you bought me a nice, big, fat steak and a couple of beers... -: Again. - Tell me. What do you want? A stock tip? - A tip, yeah, but not on the stock, Mike. I need a little info on one of your clients. - Well, you know I can't do that. - Yeah, I do. - OK. I know you're thinking, hey, he's not going to say no to me! I'm Sergeant Major Marco Salvare. Hero of the 75th and the man who saved his life. Am I right? Alright, who is it? - The Osbornes. - Come on, man. Those are some of my biggest clients. - You trading for Claymore? Is he up or down? How far down? - Coming! Josiah. - Just like your father, prying into people's business. - Technically, prying was my father's business, but I can totally see where you're going with this. Um, it's not really a good time right now. Maybe we could meet in daylight, perhaps at a mall or maybe in public or at the police station? Oh, that's... That is very pretty. - Sutcliff gave this to Melanie. Probably stole it. You know, I... I thought I raised her better. I don't know where I went wrong. I told her we shouldn't have gone to that wedding. We didn't belong there. Now I got the police showing up at my door. You and your boyfriend. - He's... actually not. What did you tell the police? - Nothing. They said I need a lawyer. - Well, you do, if you killed Jack Sutcliff. It's no secret you hated him. You fought with him at the wedding. You came back in a second time. - If I killed him, I would have done it face to face, not on the back. - I have to say, that's not the greatest defense. - I raised Melanie by myself. All I ever did was try to protect her. And then Jack Sutcliff comes along and leaves her with a baby and a broken heart. How would you feel if someone did that to your daughter? - Not good. - I went back in to see him. I can't say what I would have done, but when I found him, he was already dead. I knew they'd blame me, so I grabbed Melanie and left. - You have to tell that to the police. I can recommend a lawyer. We went to school together. He's really good. Let me have him call you. - You know, I... I know I haven't been much of an uncle to you. Especially after your husband died, I... It's just my nature, I guess. Thank you. You alright? - I'm fine. - What was he doing here? - Unraveling. - What's this? - Our latest clue. ♪♪ I didn't know you sold lighters. - Oh, yeah. Every now and then. - You don't still smoke, though. - Still want one. You know what? That is a pretty bracelet. - Do you think it was stolen from Gloria Osborne? - No. I mean, it's fake, right? I mean, it's a good fake, but it's a fake. Don't tell me this is a gift from Marco. - Oh, absolutely not. No, no. We are so not close to the fake jewelry stage. - Got it. - Or any stage. - Yeah, my mistake. - Jack Sutcliff gave this to my cousin Melanie. - Oh. Well, that figures. - Hey, I'm sorry about bringing up the business card and stuff. - I'm glad you did. I mean, I felt awful lying to Nicky and now I'm... Well, you're a very good friend. - Oh, thank you. - Thank you. Thanks. Good luck with it. - Fake! - Yeah! Oh, Mrs. Dewhurst, we have in the new diamonds. ♪♪ - I found some blood on the door to Richard's shop. My dad's having it analyzed. -: And you're thinking it'll probably match Jack's blood? - No. And even if it does, the real killer could have planted it there. Which I saw in a Magnum, P.I.rerun. - Anything else to report, Magnum? - No, just some antique lighters in the jewelry case. - Really? - Oh! I gotta go. OK, bye. Bethany, hi! - Abby. I was wondering if you wanted to grab dinner later. - Oh. Oh, I'd love to, but, um, rain check? I'm going to the Osborne estate to wish bon voyage to the newlyweds. Still married, huh? - Oh, I've got some good news, though. - I could use some. - You know Dr. Burken from the drugstore? Her daughter just got engaged. Hoping for a spring wedding. I suggested you plan it. - And they know about the...? - The dead body at your last one? They don't care, as long as you're in their budget. - Thank you, Abby. Thank you so much. - You're welcome. Oh, and I'm doing the flowers. So here's to our next venture. May everyone remain upright. Oh, I am so rude. I'm so sorry. Do you want a cup of tea or coffee? - I'd love a coffee. - I'll make a fresh pot. Let me just put this away. - Do you need to get that? - Oh, no. They're not impatient. Though I sell impatiens. - This is Hugh Hammerholt. If your call has anything, whatsoever, to do with my ex-wife Bethany, do not call me back. Do I make myself clear? - You checked up on me. - I'm sorry. I just... Sometimes I just, I can't help myself. - I thought we were friends. - We are! - If you want to know something, why don't you just ask me? - OK. Why would you say your husband was dead? - Because I wish he was. - Oh. - I spent years planning the perfect wedding for other people and then it was my turn and he left me after two weeks. It was humiliating and not a story I wanted to tell or think about again. Is that what you wanted to hear? - No. Bethany, wait. I'm really sorry. - Me too. ♪♪ - Not exactly the wrong side of the tracks, huh? - This will give us a chance to find out some information on Claymore. : Thank you, sir. Thanks. - Hello, hello! - Hey, guys. - Abby and Marco! Hi. - That's me, tagging along. How you doing? Hey, buddy, how are you? - Hey! - Oh! Look what I got. A little gift from us. - Yes, to celebrate four days of glorious marriage. - So how's married life treating you? - No complaints so far. - When do you guys take off? - Tomorrow, finally. I cannot wait to feel that warm sand on my toes. But it means I'm going to have to take off these new shoes. - You seem happy. - We are. - We are too. Aren't we, honey? Whoa! I would like to propose a toast. To four of the happiest people around. - To the newlyweds. - Yes. To the newlyweds. : Cheers. - Oh, listen, Claymore, I've been meaning to tell you. The bar's taking off and I have a little extra cash lying around. I thought I'd invest in the market and I was just wondering if you had a recommendation for me. - I don't really play the market. - Oh. That's... Oh, I just... I thought you would. - No, I like to play it safe. - Oh. Smart! - Isn't it wonderful we're all family now? Well, except for you, Marco, but who knows what the future holds, no? - Let's not get ahead of things. - Yeah, way ahead. - Miles. - Continents. - Galaxies. How much longer do you want to keep going with this? - That covers it. - So Abby, I'm hoping this time next year you'll be putting together a flower arrangement for our baby shower. - Well, you move very fast. I-- - Gotta move fast. Making up for lost time. - Whoa, look at that! Got some Cubans, huh? - Every fantastic puff. - They smell awful, but they're his only vice. - He may have another one. Or two. - What's that supposed to mean? - Is that you, Claymore? - Yeah. So? - I thought that you didn't know Jack Sutcliff, and yet you were arguing with him before your wedding and before he was murdered. - What... What are you doing, Abby? Everything's fine. - What she's trying to say, Claymore, is that you stole your mother's jewelry and wanted Jack to fence it and you replaced the real jewelry with fakes so she wouldn't know, didn't you? - Why on earth would he do something like that? - 'Cause your husband, Jillian, is $2 million in debt. Give or take. - Wha... Is any of this true? - I wanted to have my own money so we could have our own life. - Claymore, don't say another word. Last time I checked, it's not illegal to sell your own jewelry. - Yeah, but it is illegal to kill the person who's blackmailing you. - Jack wasn't blackmailing me. - What were you arguing about? - The amount. We were doing business together. He was skimming from me. - That I believe. - Get off my property. - Are you coming with us? - No. I'm staying with my husband. - He'll be under mommy dearest's thumb the rest of his life. - Do you think he killed Jack? - I don't know, Abby. I don't think he's got the guts for it. - Jack got hit from behind. - Possible 10-54 on route 2, Stony Cross. - You hear that? Hold on. - I repeat, possible 10-54 on route 2, Stony Cross. - It's 10-54. It's a dead body, Abby. - That's the Turner farm. - Yeah. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. - Hey, hey, hey. Guys, guys. It's OK. I got this. - What happened? - Melanie Turner's dead. -: No! - Her father came home and found her in the bathtub. It looks like she overdosed and drowned. - Overdosed? On what? - We won't know until the toxicology report's back. We're assuming it was a suicide. - Why would she commit suicide? It doesn't make sense. - Makes no sense to you, ma'am, because you're not a cop. - Look, look. Melanie's family, alright? Come on. Let's put the badge away for five seconds. Just tell us what's going on. - A broken piece of the crystal bowl was in her room with her prints on it, so she obviously killed Jack in a lover's quarrel and she couldn't deal with the guilt. - Or whoever killed Jack also killed Melanie and is framing her. - You watch too much TV. - It doesn't mean I'm not right. - OK, look. If you killed someone, would you actually steal the murder weapon and then bring it home with you and leave it lying around? I mean, really? - Sometimes killers aren't that calculating. This was a crime of passion. There's no logic involved. - What's going to happen to that poor baby with both of her parents gone? - Josiah's sister in South Bend is taking him, and apparently she and her husband loved Melanie like a daughter. I'm sorry. I would have liked to have seen this ended differently too. - You OK? - Something's not right about this. - I know. I know. Hey, Abby. - Hey, Dad. - Ah, poor Melanie, huh? I do have some good news. The blood at Richard's store was from a bird. - A bird flew into the door and triggered the alarm. - Yes. While I'm here, I'll need another bouquet. Something... lively this time, that says "I miss you." - OK. - "I love you." - Oh, OK. So probably something red? Something beautiful. Something full of life. - How about a little of everything? - Who is this for? - Your mother. - Oh. ♪♪ ♪♪ - Honey, listen. Let's celebrate tonight. OK, love you.

Why don't you take the day off and go surprise him? - Really? Thank you. - Yeah. Oh, but promise me first that if I ever even think about getting involved with something other than floral arranging, you'll tie me to a rosebush. Thorns included. - Well, I can't make any promises. And besides, a few thorns couldn't stop you. Hey! - Hey, how you doing? - Oh, and now that you're out of other people's business, focus on your own. Ugh. Hey. - Hey. So, uh, this-- - Want a coffee? - Oh, yeah, actually. Thank you. Um...
