Can we get a round of shots? Hey. It's the police. Wake up. Cool. Your face! You got a real surprise, huh, Mirko? You have to go. I'm off to work, and my boyfriend'll be back soon. That's his T-shirt, by the way. - You have a boyfriend? - It's an open relationship. But still, it wouldn't be cool if you were still here. It's okay. My name is Milo, by the way. Yes. Right. What's my name again? Hey, asshole, this is a bikeway! Morning. - Everything okay? Are you hurt? - No. No, not again! Good morning! - Okay guys, the party's over. - What? What's going on here? Renzo! - Guys, this is my bed. Get out. - What? Hey, Milo! Hey. Is it okay if I do some cleaning? I'll do such a cool job. Really sparkly. Real... That okay? Renzo! Okay, off you go. - Faster. Goodbye. Thanks. - What a square. This sucks. - Thanks. - Bye. - Bye, Milo. - Okay. Bye. - Ciao, Milo. - Don't come back. Thanks. Bye. - Goodbye. - Yep. Okay. That's ours. Thank you. Bye. Renzo! Wake up! Morning, Milo. - Is there a problem? - No. Everything's great! Oh man! I don't know how they all ended up here. I didn't know them. If you want to stay here, make a change. No wonder Ricky threw you out. That was completely different. All right, I'm sorry. - Want a Bloody Mary as well? - No. You shouldn't drink so much either. We need to make a change, and I don't mean our haircuts, I mean... the basics. Dude... It's too early to have this conversation. No! It's not too early, actually it's far too late! I just woke up in an apartment with some woman who didn't know my name. - And I didn't know hers. - Steffi, I think. The point is... I think I'm just getting too old for all this superficial bullshit. Someday I want to be taking my kids to school, you know? Yes. I get what you're saying. You think we should quit the nightlife? No. Not at all. I just think it's time we took a step, and finally opened our own place. Be our own bosses at last. We'll hire people. Go to the office in the daytime. All respectable. Then we can lead a normal life. Family... Kids... Bike rides and stuff... Dude, when you talk like that, it brings tears to my eyes. I love bike rides! I never had that. You know what? I'm up for that. Let's get fucking respectable. You two are really good buddies, right? Watch out, here comes the chaos team! Those are just to show how long we've known each other, and dreamed of having our own bar. Got it. I think you're both great guys. Seriously. Big double-like from my point of view. But to be totally honest, I'm no "nightlife expert". Let's put it that way. But you do go for a drink now and then... I do, yes. I like socializing. When I do, I can go off like a little gun and become a wild party animal. Okay, Heiko... May I call you Heiko? The Kirk Bar here in Kreuzberg... We know the owner. - Kirk. - Yeah, and he wants out. The property owner will reserve it for us till next week. Great location. Regular customers... Cool shit. And for renovation, licenses and transfer fees, we'll need around 100,000 euros. Well, unfortunately I can't approve such loans alone, and when my boss Mr. Holrich hears "nightlife", he thinks "money laundering", "drugs", "violence". You have to present it to your boss in a totally different way. Nightlife... It's of elemental importance. Without it, there'd be no humanity. In the Stone Age, people danced around the fire at night and drummed. Nightlife is about... meeting, getting together. - Celebrating life. Music. - Reproduction. Ultimately, we all only plunge into the night to meet that one person, who we want to wake up next to for the rest of our lives. Hearing that, it makes you want to plunge into the nightlife again yourself. And milk the bear again a bit. Tickle the gland a bit. Then come see us in our bar. We'll really take the plunge, we'll show you Berlin. I've got butterflies! Heiko, you need to vacate the conference room. Yes, sure. We're nearly finito. Are you going to your game night tonight? Yes. Well? I sent you a little email in that regard. Yes, several. I'm afraid I can't tonight. I'm meeting my sister. Right. Well, then have fun. Bye-bye. See you, Petra. Right... Super-hot bird, righta? I don't mean that in a sexist way. I mean it very lovingly. Okay? Birds are precious. Worth protecting. Right? I'm not getting any younger. And... Life as a single in Berlin... it can be very... It can be very frustrating. - Heiko. - Yep. Forget your games and come to our bar. Sorry, not tonight, no way. Game night is sacrosanct. But I have time tomorrow. Signorina Come with me to Mallorca I'm a fitness trainer And I drink protein With Signorina Come with me to Ibiza I am a fitness trainer And now you will drink protein of mine Steffen K, alpha man Fitness trainer on Instagram 8000 followers and rising Despite the massive fame, self-effacing I used to be rock bottom, playing hooky And now I'm at the top, an influencer Party with the stars, make noise Party with ma homies, the Bachelor Boys Celebs and glamor and photographers All living creatures want to sleep with us Well? How did you get an appointment with us again? I had a thing going with your boss's secretary. And why do you call yourselves The Bachelors? Well, obviously because the other two look a bit like the Bachelor. Am I supposed to think that's cool? Yes! There's massive marketing potential. - But you should be telling us that. - The Bachelor is a sexist show. - It's okay if it's sexy. - Sexist! Not sexy. And you? Do you look like anyone? No one. I'm Steffen K, fitness trainer from Nuremberg. And I have 8000 Instagram followers. And my YouTube channel is exploding. I've got the modern fitness-blogger, nutrition-fashion-VIP thing dialed. I'm the mastermind of the trio. The brain! And together, we're the... - Bach... - ...e... lors. - Bachelors. - Bachelors. Need to practice a bit. - Oh God! So, dear Bachelors... - Exactly! As a label, we work with genuine artists. With real musicians. Understand? Not with fitness trainers or Z-list celebrity lookalike wannabes, or whatever it is you are. - Hey, Sunny. - Hey, Max. I have a few roses for you again. If you ask me, this guy's overdoing it a little. - Thank you. - Sure. Ciao. So, what's the deal? All right, listen guys. I don't have a rose for you. - Hi, sweetie. - Hi. - I missed you. - You've turned up in style. Okay, you find it embarrassing. I knew it. - Next time I'll come on my bike again. - Nonsense, this car's really beautiful. - What are you doing? - Me? Nothing. Checking my emails. You were swiping. Were you looking at photos? Or... Wait a minute. You weren't on Tinder or anything? No, Sunny, of course not. No way! You're on Tinder, swiping through women here in bed? Yes! I'm communicating. I have friends on Tinder. Tinder's like Facebook. Tinder is not like Facebook. Tinder's like Fuckbook. And you're looking for fuck-dates while we're here in... Sweetie! - What the hell do you want from me? - Yes, sorry, but what did you expect? For us to be in a monogamous relationship? Sweetie! Call me Sweetie one more time... You want to travel with me, you send me roses, and you talk about destiny, Jan! So? That doesn't mean I can't meet other women. - Sunny... What era are you living in? - I wonder about that, too. Why does this always happen to me? Man! Mega-refreshing! And the music here... It is so mega-cool. - Maybe you should invite Petra here. - Maybe. But seriously, Renzo, I'll tell you something. We'll get you your own bar. I'll fight for you. Like a ninja. But with your little conviction, it won't be that simple. - Everyone makes mistakes. - That's it. We're all human. We are all human! - And we wanna dance. - Looks like it, bro! And I need another drink, bro. - You'll get it, bro. - Yes! Stop calling each other "bro" right now. - Have you given him a pill? - He wanted one. He meant an aspirin, you idiot! He's our bank adviser. - Take a look at him! He's happy! - He's too happy, you moron. Maybe you'd like to escort your friend to the toilet, Renzo? - Now! - Right. Excuse me. Hello? - Hi. What can I get you? - A double advocaat. A double advocaat? You like the old-fashioned stuff. Yan you spare me the comments and just get me a damn advocaat, okay? There you go. Sorry I was so harsh. I've just had a really awful evening. It's okay. Want to talk about it? That's what barkeepers are for. No thanks. - Thanks. Keep the change. - Thank you. See you again soon perhaps. Hey, wake up. I don't get it. The young man was on a website? Tinder! On Tinder, Herbert. I'm on Tinder, too. It's not bad. But not when you're in bed with a lady. That's out of order. That's... shitty of Jan. Asshole! I'm really sorry, Sunny. Georg, pour us another advocaat, please. I'll buy a round. What was I to expect? I met him in the nightlife. The men who go out are all unhinged. Technically speaking this is nightlife, too, Sunny. No, Dad! This? This is nice. Anyway, it's only 5 pm. Why do you always go for the bad boys? You've got a thing for bad boys, sweetheart. That's not true, Hilde! He's an architect. He sent me roses. He even wrote poetry. That's your weak point. You're too romantic. - You're stupidly romantic! - Nonsense! You are, you're very romantic, my darling. Sunny, I think it's great you're like that. Without romance, life would be crap. May I have this dance? - They were here, Sunny. - Excuse me? What? - The Bachelors. They were here. - So? So? Their fitness video got half a million hits. On the first day. You know what that means? Mallorca, beer tent, getting featured on TV shows. It'll be a smash hit and who will make the money? Not us. Leslie, do you want to work with fifth-rate Instagram morons? Yes, I do. If those Bachelor morons are a cash-cow, I want to be a Bachelor, too. I have three kids, Sandra. Now they even want a goddamn PlayStation at Easter. When I started here, you told me to find and develop bands that suit my taste. Stop that childish nonsense. Grow up at last! - I'm disappointed, Sandra. - You know what? Maybe this just isn't the right place for me. - Maybe I should just go elsewhere. - Yes. And you will. I was going to tell you. You're going to Atlanta. If you want to. You mean... You always wanted to go abroad, so I commended you to our partners and... they seem to think you're great. We could go on a trip on Sunday. - Go on a bike ride. - Can you even ride a bike? What's that supposed to mean? Of course I can ride a bike. Ricky, can't you see how hard I'm trying? I'm turning my whole life around. - Ricky, I need you in the kitchen. - Coming. Renzo, we go way back. And hey. We had a lot of fun. But I was 20 then. Mom, can I have the phone? No, do your homework first. And eat that apple. I don't do nightlife anymore. I have a day-life. - Can you get that in your head? - Ricky, that's the point. I want a day-life, too. I'm becoming respectable. Milo and I are opening our own place. Please get a grip on your own problems first. What problems, Ricky? - Renzo? - Yes? Are you an alcoholic? I'm a barkeeper. That's totally different, Henri. Why do you ask? Ricky, it's really unfair that the boy should find that out. That's not for him. Then next time, don't turn up to his school play totally high. I wasn't totally high. I was in good spirits. And Henri, you were great as that toadstool. I was a ladybug. Right! That's why you flew around! I get it now. It was an outstanding performance. Totally convincing. Renzo, you know how much I like you. But I already have one child. I don't need another. So shall we go on a bike ride on Sunday? No! The cappuccino with oat milk was for you, right? Okay, Sun, last chance to say it's all a stupid joke. Sorry, Lucy, but I'm doing it. I fly on Sunday evening. I have a ticket. It's crazy, man. You don't leave Berlin. You move to Berlin! Hello! Guys! Could you be a little more positive? - Atlanta! It's a massive opportunity. - I still think it's really shit of you. And it smells of shit here, too. Yes, Nicki did a poop. That's great, honey. - That's her comment on your plans. - You think Atlanta guys are different? Hello! This isn't about guys anymore. I'm done with all that. Sorry, Sun, but that's total bullshit. It's only just beginning! Biologically, I mean. Hey, so... So this is your last weekend in Berlin? Then we really have to party. I'm not interested in any more nightlife. Enough already! You've decided enough, you dictator! We decide how we say farewell, okay? Buongiorno. I just got... some great news. She said yes. - Who said yes? - Petra. She said she'd come to mine for the games night. It... It'll be mega. Great. We're happy for you, Heiko. It's... And how's it looking with the loan? The loan! Oh boy! Boy oh boy. I fought, guys. Believe me, I battled. Like a ninja. But my boss rejected your application. Your conviction is the problem, Renzo. We don't lend to drug dealers. - That's what my boss says. - I'm not... I drove a car from A to B. That's all. I'm terribly sorry. I hope you won't hold it against me personally. Maybe you can come to my games night? I'd be mega-glad. I swear, Milo, I'll come up with the money. You don't get it. The Kirk Bar's gone. It was reserved for us till today. Then we'll find another location. - We'll do this. I'll sort it out. - Don't get any crazy ideas. Bike rides, that's my idea. That's our aim. I've spent three years trying to be a father to the boy, though he isn't my son. And you know why? I love the little maniac. I love Ricky. Do you understand? And I want to show her I'm serious about her. And about the bar. - Or do you want to go it alone? - No, man! I'm not doing it without you. We're family, Renzo. And it stays that way, no matter what. I could cry again. You're the best. You're my bro! - Fuck! Are you crazy? What the hell? - What is it? You stuck your tongue in my eye, you idiot. It stings like hell. - I ate Thai earlier. Sorry. - Idiot! I'm really sorry. But that thing really suits you. Does it still hurt? No, you idiot. The doc just said not to stick your tongue in my eye for a while. I'll try. I'm leaving early tonight, okay? I've cleared it with Mary. - Will I see you later? - We'll see. Ladies. Those guys have invited us to join them. What do you say? How often do I have to tell you? I'm not in the mood for any guys. How about that! What a coincidence. We met before. I'm Steffen K. But I guess you know me from Instagram. I'm a VIP fitness trainer from Nuremberg. And they... They're my bros. They're The Bachelors. - Hey. - Good evening. How did you even get in here? I had a thing going with the bouncer's sister. - It's super here. - Berlin's totally crazy. Mad! - Hi. My name's Mia. - Hey! - How do you know each other? - They're complete morons. So, girls, how's it looking? Can we buy you a drink? -We could also go into the VIP area. -There is no VIP area here. It sounds very enticing, but quite honestly... - We just want to be alone. - Hey, Sunny, don't be so tense. Here, try this. It's a Skinny Niagara. Sugar-free. Come on! It's super here. It's a bit like Ibiza, right? Come on, try it. Fuck! Shit! Oh my God! Can't you be careful with that damn umbrella? You asshole! But you made such an unnatural movement. - I think I'm blind, man! - See you later... at Bergheim? In the VIP area? Closing time, my friends. Renzo, man, where are you? I'm worried. I hope you haven't drunk yourself under a table. I'm going for a currywurst. Call me. Thanks. - Is this space free? - Yes, sure. - Do you always go around like that? - No. Do you? No. I think I've seen you somewhere before. I think I served you an advocaat. What's going on here? That's hilarious. I mean... Unless you're blind, which wouldn't be funny. No. I'm not. Mia? We were going to that other table over there. Yes. We were going there. So... - No, stay here. - Have fun, pirates! You're so silly! Milo. - Sandra. Or Sunny. - Nice to meet you. Berlin is so beautiful here. So peaceful. "Cheetah" used to be over there. My parents met there at a Saturday Night Fever party. I love the soundtrack. I think I should go. Sorry. We only just met. - We don't know each other. - What's all this all of a sudden? I've had sub-optimal experiences with guys like you. - What kind am I? - A guy from the nightlife. - So? - That means stress. That's nonsense. What's with the prejudice? Apart from that, I'm only in Berlin this weekend. I fly to Atlanta on Sunday to start a new job and a new life. So, sorry. You can't just leave like this. I mean look at us! Two pirates. It's destiny! Don't say that word! I cannot stand that destiny number. - What number? - I'm going now. I'm sorry, but... Ciao. Beautiful, isn't it? Like snowflakes. Everything okay? - Interesting turnaround! - Shut up. Okay, enough. I can't. I can really do without the dating games, and all the blah blah blah. Let's go on one date. Tomorrow, Saturday night... Well, today! One single date. Let's have dinner. Really relaxed. And get to know each other. Please. All right. Give me your number. I'll call you. At 3 pm precisely. No silly games. No stress. I said I'm no stress. Thank you. - Okay. - I'll be expecting your call. - Officially, at 3 pm. - Yes. - Shall I walk you home? - No. I think I want to be alone. Okay. Renzo! You have no idea what has just happened. Renzo! Renzo. Where are you? Listen. I know this sounds mega-cheesy, but I think I just met Miss Right. She had an eye-patch, just like me. I'm just sending you a message. Everything okay? Quiet! I'm in serious trouble. - How do you mean, serious? - Fucking serious. - I did a job last night. - Don't say you drove a car from A to B. I did it for us! For Ricky. For the money for the bar. Jesus, Renzo. To hell with the money. Do you want to ruin your life? Go back to jail? Please stop it. Okay, what happened? They gave me this car. A pharmacy emergency car. I was to drive it to the Port of Hamburg and back. It was a super-quick journey. No problem. Then suddenly I got hungry. I parked around the corner. And went to the 24/7 store. I bought a bar of chocolate. Is that relevant? Kind of. When I came out, the car was gone. And the three kilos of coke. You had three kilos of coke in the car? - Yeah, man. - You are an uber-moron. Three kilos, man? What were you doing? Shit! Okay, who? An Arab clan? Not Arabs. Guys from Marzahn. They have this Children's Paradise. - With bouncy castles and... - They sound pretty friendly. - Fond of children. - It's camouflage. That's them. - Come, come, come. - What are you doing? Renzo! We know you're in there. - Shit! - Are you insane? Come, come, come. We have to get out of here. Why we? Why me? Renzo, open the fucking door. Renzo! Hi. Hello. Where is Renzo? Renzo? He's not here. Hello! I can see you. Renzo. Don't be an idiot. - Come down. Let's talk. - I told you what happened. The damn car got stolen. Now please leave us in peace. Please. For fuck's sake. Koma, get him off the roof. I don't want to climb on the roof. Let him stew there. If I go, I'll kill him. Misha, take it easy. Let him sit up there. He's high again. We'll talk to him instead. What's your name, kid? - Milo. - Nice name. Congratulations. - Thanks. - You two are life partners? Not quite. We're... good friends. Renzo could use a good friend right now. You know, Milo, your friend up on the roof there, he owes us a little package. Do you know where it is? - I know nothing. - Are you having us on? Do you know who we are? What we do? You have a... Children's Paradise? The package? Where is the package? - Renzo said the car got stolen. - Stolen? You know what I think? We should chop his head off, dry him in the bathroom and send him to your father. - Good idea. Pavel will like that. - We have to set an example. We need the goods. Calm down, Misha. Stop that bullshit. Milo, please excuse my two associates. They're a bit uncultured. They wanted to chop your heads off, and take them to my father. He'd make tankards out of them. - Tankards. - He likes to drink beer from skulls. He likes all that Viking crap. Do you like the Vikings? So-so. You know, Milo, you seem like a really sensible kid to me. A cultural integration success story. A real German, who sorts his trash, who's tidy and punctual. And that's why I believe that you will return my package to me. Or something worth 150,000 euros, I don't give a shit what. Maybe your grandma's jewelry? To be honest, I don't quite understand what I've got to do with any of this. Wait, wait, wait. You have something to do with this, because he says so. - Is that clear? - So, Milo. Listen. You have one night, one. 12 noon tomorrow is the deadline. The emphasis is on dead. Do you understand me? We can't hear you, Milo. Yes, yes. I understand. Okay. Renzo. Come back in. They've gone, for God's sake. - I'm staying here forever. - Pull yourself together! Don't shout at me, or I'll jump! - Please come back in. - Okay! Man! Is there anyone you can talk to? Anyone? Forget it. We're dead. We are so dead. That's the bit that I don't really get. Why am I dead? I'm so sorry I got you into this. It's all my fault. I... I need some fresh air. I have to get out. You just were... Renzo! Look at the people. They're so free! Like butterflies. Renzo, focus! So, once again, is there any chance we can find the stolen car? The car's gone. It'll be in Romania somewhere. With 200 families dancing around it. - We have to raise the money. - We don't have 150,000 euros! You don't say! - Can't we just go to the police? - Are you crazy? They'll detain me. They'll stab me. Their men are everywhere. They'll find you too! We have to get out of Berlin. - We have to go to ground. - How do you mean? Disappear! Spend a few months in a mountain lodge in Bavaria. What lodge? I can't go to Bavaria. I have a date. - Are you screwing with me? - No, man. This date is extremely important to me, okay? Renzo, you can't get drunk now. We have to think logically. There is one possibility. I know a place with that much money lying around. - It's just lying around? - Yes. A few guys stash their cash in a cabin on a lake in Brandenburg. Who are these guys? Some kind of rap crew. I drove some stuff from A to B for them. What rap crew? Well, they're not De La Soul, they're more like hooligan dudes. These guys have no sense of humor. They don't even rap. And your brainwave is to steal 150,000 euros from them, that's... Do you have a better idea? Paint the money or what? - We can't just rob people. - They're not normal people. They've put so many guys in hospital. They've robbed grandmas. They deserve it. If we steal the money from them, we're like Robin Hood or something. No, Renzo, honestly. We should just talk to the police. Then we're dead! Don't you get it? I want to live! I want a family! Yeah? I want kids. I want to go on bike rides. Tell me you want that, too. - Tell me you want that, too! - Be quiet, man. Listen. You only have to drive me to the cabin. I'll do the rest. Okay, I'll help you. On the condition that you promise, on our friendship, that you'll stop driving stuff from A to B or C, or wherever the hell, okay? Do you understand? Promise me. I promise you. I promise, on our friendship. Don't interrupt me! Hey, Sunny. You really are super-punctual. Is everything okay with you? Yes. Everything's fine. Super-fine. I'm doing great. I'm taking a walk in the park. It's beautiful. Trees and stuff. Birds. Nice... About tonight, do you know the Bin Go place? - The bingo? - No, Bin Go. Asian. It's right around the corner from me. - Say at 7:30? - 7:30? I don't know if I can make that. Would a bit later be okay? Around... 11:00 perhaps? Are you crazy? For dinner? - In Argentina they eat at midnight. - But we're not in Argentina. Milo, don't complicate things. - Let's say 8:30? - Okay. 8:30. I'll be there, okay? See you then. Look forward to seeing you. Cool. Me too. Ciao. What men under 70 take a walk alone in the park? - Drug dealers? - Come on! Give the man a chance. It's your first date. I think you guys will have a very romantic evening, Sunny. I can sense it. Ricky, listen, it's me. I just wanted to tell you how much I'm thinking about you. And how much I love you both. And I want to go on those damn bike rides with you. - Let's go tomorrow morning. - Are you high, dude? What are you on? An overdose of love is what I'm on. That's all, Ricky. I love you both. - Renzo, stop this drivel. Please. - No! I won't stop. I'm only just starting. Tell Henri I love him. And I love you, too. Ciao. Bye. Was that Renzo? Once again, I need to be there by 8 pm. Milo, I've got it. And now we switch to gangster mode. Come on, man. Give me a beat. Put on a beat. We need a beat. - Please turn around. - We have to walk from here. Sneak up. I'm going nowhere. I said I'd drive you. But you have to come! Are you totally crazy? You're completely useless here. Hey. I've got a proper plan. We can't even park there. It's a nature reserve. Cut the junior sleuth crap. We must be ice-cold and execute the plan. What is the damn plan? The plan is you climb a tree and observe the situation. What do you mean I climb a tree? Yes. You observe. Meanwhile I go into the cabin and, if anything out of the ordinary happens, you give me a signal. - What signal? - Well, a signal! - Do an owl hoot! - Hoot? That's completely stupid. - It isn't stupid. - There are no owls in Berlin. - We're in Brandenburg! - Whatever! I couldn't give a hoot. - What will you do? - I'll call you. Hello! Phone! Hello! Risky! We're not using phones. We're not amateurs. We are amateurs! That's the point. We are total amateurs. - You perhaps. - But hooting? Really professional! Hooting isn't exactly gangster-style. Hooting's a classic, man. I guarantee it will work. - And how does a damn owl hoot? - How d'you think an owl hoots? - That's why an owl is said to hoot. - Okay, that makes sense. Try it out! Be a fucking professional. We don't have time to clown around. That really does sound silly. Call me instead. Left leg. Then the right. Your right leg! - I'm concentrating. - Push yourself up. Push up! Now your right on there. That's it! - Perfect. - Shut your mouth! That wasn't your first time, huh? Really good. - Man, are you getting on my nerves! - Can you see everything? - Go on now. - Milo... - I love you. - Go! For goodness' sake! - Shit, there are owls here. - Milo! - Was that you? Are you the owl? - No. We agreed you would call! It wasn't me. There are real owls here. - I can't hear you. - Owls. Real ones. Real ones! Oh fuck! Hello, Sunny. Hey, Milo. It's me again. Are you okay? Yes, are you okay? Hey listen. Bin Go doesn't have a table until 9. Great. That suits me better anyway. - Why are you whispering? - I'm kind of in the woods. In a nature reserve. There's a bird nesting, and there's frogs and things. You spend a lot of time in nature. Yes. That's me. I like to hang out in the woods. - See you later. Looking forward to it. - Okay, see you later. Bye. - Now he's in the woods. - But that's nice. Yes! These are my bags. My bags. My bags! Fuck! Renzo! Get out of there! No! Renzo! Get out of there! Renzo, get out! Renzo! Get out! There's a jeep coming. We have to get away. What are you doing? It was them! They stole the car and the coke. What an idiot! Fuck! - Five 70s. - Five 70s? No way! - Last time I came, you pressed 20! - No, I said I did 20 reps. 20 reps? - Don't talk shit, man. - No way, whether you're bulking or not. - Bulking, dude! - Your balls can do 20 reps. I do not believe it, dude. No, no, no, no, no, no. Fuck, man! Goddamn! They better not. They better not have! - Fuck! Get the dog, Mike! - What? What's with you? Should I email you? Get the fucking dog! Man! If they have dogs, we're screwed. The cabin was your responsibility. Just get one thing right! Let's take one of the boats. - What boat? - There. Track them. Track them, Tayson. Go on, go on! Is that Renzo? Renzo, you fool, I can see you. - Come back right now. - You started it. You stole my car. I won't let you screw with me. What's that dipshit talking about? No idea. Renzo, what are you on about? Stop paddling now, you spacko! Or you're dead, Renzo. Hand me a piece, Mike. I'll kill them. - I don't know if... - Get me a damn gun, I said! - Faster, Milo, faster. - I can't go any faster! Fucking stand-up paddle board. - Are you kidding me? - We don't have anything else here. This is a flare gun, Attilla. Well, it sure packs a punch. - Final warning, Renzo. - Faster! Respect, man. Renzo! Only it's a shame you hit the rucksack. We're on fire! Tayson, fetch! Fetch. In you go. Go! Get them, Tayson, get them. Swim, boy, swim. Goddamn it! You are such an idiot! Genius plan! Super strategy! Well-devised, down to the last detail! Okay, it didn't go that well. But calm down. Inhale... Exhale... Inhale... Drive! - Faster! Faster! - Shut up! - Fuck! Shit! - Hit reverse! - Where have they come from? - Go, go! Cute car, huh? Come here... - Look out, there are trees! - I can see! This is a forest! - Go that way. This way. Drive! - Shit! Turn, man! Turn! Goddamn it! - Faster, man! - Come on! Come on! - There they are. - Man! The fuckers! - Go, go, go! - Shit! Dead end, you sons of bitches, dead end. - Buckle up! - In your cosmetic case car! Fuck! Nice stunt, man! You fucking sons of bitches! Fuck! Shit! Burn, Renzo, burn! We're burning! Fuck! - Man! - Man, man, man! Get in! You are simply the coolest. You know how you drive? Like a young god. A young god! Shut up, man. This is not cool. Are you high? Now we're really up shit creek. You should be a professional driver. Like a young god! Don't you understand? They definitely stole my coke. They stole the car... Then you must tell your Russian friends, then they can... No. That will start a gang war. Then we're double-dead. Great. This is just perfect. Perfect, Renzo. - I still think we should go to ground. - I have a date! I'm not missing it! Even if it's the last thing I ever do. This is from the gentlemen over there. They're asking if you are alone. Very kind. Thanks. But I'm waiting for someone. - Hey, Sunny. I'm so sorry, but... - I've been here for 15 minutes. That is a bit rude. - Sorry. I'll be there in 20 minutes. - Okay. It just tells me our date isn't so important... No! On the contrary, Sunny. The complete opposite. It's very important to me. - Believe me. - Man, just come. Hurry up. She's a real pain. Good grief. She isn't a pain at all. And if she is, it's in a sweet way. And don't you say that. You're the biggest pain ever. - In a sweet way? - No. Not in a sweet way. A pain-in-the-ass way! Stop it! If it wasn't for me, you'd never have met her. I got you the eye patch. Think about it. Think about it. - So, where shall I drop you? - Drop me? I'm sticking with you. No way! It's a date, you fool. For the 100th time. - Okay, I'll stay in the background. - No way! You will leave me alone. I can't be alone now. Man, I'm scared. They're looking for me. Now what? - Yes? - Hello hello! Milo. - How you doing, bro? - Heiko! This is a surprise. - I'm doing great. What are you up to? - Games night! That's why I'm calling. Bros, we need you. It would be mega to have two more players. Petra is here! Hold on... Heiko's games night! You can go there. You'll be safe. - What is it they play again? - It doesn't matter. I'll meet you after my date. - Then we'll make a new plan, okay? - No. Okay, Renzo is coming. He so excited. Mega! We're really excited. DO YOU WANT TO END THE CURRENT JOURNEY? - HOW WAS YOUR DRIVE? - GOOD. WHAT IS THE CONDITION OF THE CAR? SO-SO. Hey, Sunny. I'm terribly sorry. Hi. - You look great. - Thank you. What happened? Like I said, I spent a while... in the woods. In nature, taking a walk and swimming and paddling and stuff. Like an adventure challenge or something? Yes! Exactly. An adventure challenge... Quite an intense adventure challenge, actually. Was it fun? Yes, it was. Parts of it. But let me unwind first. Green Veltliner! Excellent. Good choice. So, Sunny... Sorry again for being late. To us, to this evening. You've got something in your hair. Just a second. I think... it's a piece of reed. To be honest, Sunny... It wasn't really an adventure challenge. My best friend was with me. He has problems and I'm helping him. What kind of problems? Relationship problems? Yes, in the broadest sense, yes. But let's not talk about problems. Let's talk about something nice. Those seeds. The snowflakes. You have some story about that, right? Okay. So far, I understand everything. I understand that you're patsies, who get robbed like schoolboys. I understand that. - Do you understand that? - He asked if you understand, man! - The cabin was your responsibility! - Hey, what are you shouting for? Are you crazy? No one told you to shout, Attilla. - Sorry, Mr. Kempa. - Hey, Heinzi! Be more considerate. The kids are asleep. Sorry, my darling. Sorry. The gentlemen are just leaving, I promise. And no one will shout again. Sorry, Mrs. Kempa. The noise was my fault. - Hands off the dinosaur! - Leave the dinosaur alone! Heinz, are you smoking? - No. - I don't believe it. - Sorry. - We had an agreement. - Asshole! - It's gone. Show some consideration. You have neighbors! Coming! I'll be right with you, Woczinski! I'll punch you in the mouth, you butthead. Then you'll sleep just fine. Forever! Heinz! That's enough! - It was dumb, it was dumb... - Asshole! Man... This is going great. It's Saturday night, you assholes. We wanted a pleasant evening. A bit of smooching, watch some series. Tenderness. That's important for a relationship. Yes, I totally get that, Mr. Kempa. I always say you have to invest time in a relationship. - You have to show affection. Attention. - Shut your mouth. Mike, you understand zilch. Who are the two guys? Come on. Come. - He's called Renzo. - What? - His name is Renzo. - Okay. - He drove a few errands for us, and... - And there was another guy. A colleague of his. Also a barkeeper. - Milo. - Barkeepers? Sweet. Okay, listen. Listen. Tell everyone who's out and about tonight, all bouncers, promoters, pimps, dealers, cleaners, taxi drivers, all the nightlife lowlife and street dogs who we know, that there's a reward. Anyone who sees these chumps will let me know immediately. I want them delivered by the morning, bound, gagged, quartered, I don't care. Get going. Good night! Hey, Renzo. Bro! Mega that you could make it. Mega-mega. Is Milo coming, too? He's coming later, Heiko. - I'm Murli, the Dwarf King. - Right... - In you come. - Just take the card... Hey, guys. This is Renzo. Gundalf, the Wizard. Archer Roderich the Fifth reporting for duty. - I'm Petra, hello. - No Petra, you're not Petra. You're Amonia, Queen of the Swamp Forest. - Yes, right. Sorry. - So! May the games begin. I'm just thinking we can do the full costume tonight. - Yeah! - Right? What costumes? My dad was in radio for 20 years. He worked in the music department. Then he opened the dance bar, Maratonga. Maratonga? Nice name. Sounds interesting. But it's not doing well. It won't last much longer. They're all in bed with hot-water bottles by 9 pm. - Sorry, I just have to take this. - Okay. - Yes? - Milo, when are you coming? - This is a total nightmare. - Why's it a nightmare? Please don't leave me alone here, Milo. - It's so humiliating. - Pull yourself together, Renzo. - I can't now. I'll come later. - I can't handle it here. Stick it out. Be strong. I need you to be strong, okay? Elegoan! Come back to the table. Yes, we want to play on. It's true. Your buddy? The poor thing. - Yes, he ended up at a games night. - I love games nights. Really? Man, Elegoan just answer the question. - Go on, Amonia, read it again. - Okay. Which door do you want to open, Elegoan? The door to the Dwarf People of Manapur? Mega-door, Elegoan. They're excellent dwarves. The door to the Gringonia Magic Circle? - The world of magic. - Or the door to the Archers of Rakato? Our arrows are soaked in dragon's blood. Dragon's blood! Guys, I'm a little overwhelmed. In theory he could just ride on through the Miracle Forest. - No he cannot, Murli! No sir! - No. Elegoan must open a door now. It says so in the Book of Eternal Signs. - Yes! Here... - It's so complicated. No, it isn't complicated. It was the same for you just now. Yes. Anyhow, it's about the Realm of Dwarves. But he isn't a Sign Changer. He has to be a Sign Changer. Of course he isn't a Sign Changer, but he can... - But he's the Prince of Elves. - No, he just had... He only just had... But that's important! Of course it is. That's what I'm saying. All I'm saying is I think you can work the nightlife and lead a normal life. Back-to-school nights, bike rides... It's just not that simple if you get home every day at 6 am. But if you have your own bar, you don't need to come home at 6 am. Know how many people have told me they want to open a club? Everyone wants to open a club. Even I wanted to open a club once. - You? - Not a club. A venue for live bands. To promote young talent. There's hardly anywhere like that. My dad's café would be absolutely ideal for that. Maybe we should join forces. It seems you're forgetting that I'm leaving town tomorrow? We were going to talk about that. - Hey, Milo. - Hey, Franky! Haven't seen you in ages! How are you? We used to work together. This is Sunny. - It's a pleasure, hello. - Hi. Hey, do you have a death wish? The whole city is looking for you. - Kempa put up a reward for you. - Who's Kempa? Nasty guy. You gotta get out of Berlin. Right now. Take off, man. Everyone is looking for you. Good luck. Ciao. Bye. Milo, hello... Is everything okay? Listen, Sunny. Maybe we'd better go somewhere else. What was that just now? Let's just take a little walk. Sunny, please. Trust me. What's the plan now? We could go for an ice cream. Somewhere different. - I know a great place in Steglitz. - Steglitz? That's 40 minutes away, Milo. I think I'll just go home. Sunny, wait. Please. Let's not break it off here. Break what off? We had dinner together, it was nice, but it's all getting kind of weird. You're getting the wrong impression of me. Our timing is just wrong. I'm flying to Atlanta tomorrow... I'm sure Atlanta's fascinating, but must you move there? I'm only going for eight months at first. Eight months? Eight months is ages. You'll meet a man in eight months! A rapper or an eight-foot basketballer. Hello! I'm not going to Atlanta to meet guys! It'll just happen. It always does. You'll forget me. That's life. But Milo, what do you expect? What? By the way, I live here. Let's stay in touch. And write. On Facebook. Facebook? Is that a joke? It still exists? My grandma's on Facebook! - Or carrier pigeons... - It's working out for you, huh, Milo? - Where's Renzo? - I think you got me mixed up. - What are you doing? Let him go! - Shut up, girl, or I'll slash you. Attilla! Mike! Come here! - Hey! Stop! - Run! - Come on, man, come on. - Get up! - Who are those guys? - I'll explain later. - We have to hide somewhere. - Hide? What is this shit, Milo? Stop right now! In there. - Excuse me. - Watch out! Stop running, goddamn it! - Excuse me. - Hey Milo, what are you doing? - Hey, we're all waiting, okay! - Shut the fuck up. Fucking tourists! All of you, man. All of you. Come on! Run! Out of the way! Come on. Come on! In there. Okay. I think we lost them. - Everything okay? - Nothing is okay. Very far from okay. You have to keep quiet, Sunny. I'm so sorry I got you into this. Will you finally tell me what the hell is going on? Okay. So... My friend's relationship problems... To be precise, it's more of a professional relationship. Renzo owes some guys a lot of money and the guys aren't very nice. - Yes. I noticed. - No, they were different guys. We owe them, too. Whatever. It's complex. Okay. Enough. I tell you, this is all a bit too crazy. Okay? I'm calling the police. No, you can't! Then I'm dead. Then we might all be dead. Our date is really sub-optimal. You do realize that, don't you? Why didn't you just cancel? I'd probably have never seen you again, and that wasn't an option. But look. We're sitting here in a goddamn pirate ship! - It's like with our patches. - Just cut the romantic crap! - It is not romantic to die on a date. - You're not going to die, I promise. - Will we hide in this ship all night? - No. Let's go to that games night. We'll be safe there. You like games nights. DWARF PARTY AT MURLI'S AKA HEIKO GANSER, STEINSTRASSE 176 YOU ROCK WHAT TRIBE IS THAT? HEY, WHO'S THE NEW GIRL? Hey guys, why have you posted it on Instagram? Hey, guys! It's very uncool posting it and tagging me. - He's square, he's square. - He's square, he's square. He's square! - Murli, someone rang. - Then open the door, hot boy! Hey, Milo. You must be Sunny. Pleased to meet you. Hello. Just so you know, the mood in here is very boisterous. Hey! Hello. These are my friends. This is Sunny, and Milo. Milo-Milodi... Elegoan, your friends are our friends. Come, join us, we're doing a sexy dance. Come. Let's dance a sexy dance. - Gundalf, chill out a bit. - All right... Thank you. Sorry about the chaos. It's my first time, too. Have they all taken mushrooms, or what? Fuck! - Did someone follow you? - No... I don't know. Hello. Sorry to bother you so late, but we're looking for some friends. Hello! Hey! Renzo! We can hear you! Listen. There's these villains. They're looking for me and my friends. Evil warriors from an evil empire. Hello. Hey! - And they're outside the door. - Sounds good. Listen. All you have to do is hide us. We're not here. We're not here. Hello, you clowns. You hard of hearing? We were ringing. What's going on? And where is Renzo? Answer, Peter Pan. We know Renzo was here. We follow him on Instagram, okay? What is there to laugh about? - We don't know any Renzo. - No, never heard of him. Who is Renzo? Okay, I see five pieces on the board, but only four assholes on the sofa. - Tell me where he is right now. - This is such a wonderful evening. Abracadabra! Okay, we'll play a different game now. May I? Here's the deal. If you three don't tell me where he is in five seconds, I'll cut this little princess's finger off. But not the middle finger, I'll still need that. I really will! Five! - Four. - Four! - Where is he? - It's a secret we'll take to the grave. Three. Two. - I'll do it. Last chance. Where is he? - I magicked him away. Yes! That is cool! It hurts! This is really cool. I think I need a Band-Aid. - I found her finger! - They're really sick. Right. The number with the finger was very mean. - Now get out of Almudia! - Leave the Dwarf Realm! - They have nothing to do with it. - If you've got a problem, come to us. I don't have a problem, you do, my friend! - You have a problem. If you don't... - Leave Elegoan alone! - There! - Cool! Gundalf! My boys! Get out! That's it! Piss off! Victory for the Dwarves! - Triumph for the Dwarves! - Mega! - Mega! - Victory for the Dwarves! - Victory for the Dwarves! - Freedom for Almudia! Thrown from the balcony? Are you kidding me? No, Mr. Kempa, I swear. Those guys are hardcore. - We're taking Attilla to hospital. - Must I do everything myself? Must I do it all myself? You zero, you failure, you shithead! I'm sorry, Mr. Kempa, but they want war. War they shall have! I'm coming. Turn around and wait there. - Don't be a wuss, Mike. - Yes, Mr. Kempa, I'll try. I'll try. Goddamn it! Fuck! Heiko, please be sensible. Guys, believe us. You really have to go to hospital, Petra, please! Nonsense, I feel much better. Really, the chamomile tea is helping. - It looks much better. - So, I'll make breakfast. - Who wants eggs? - No one. Heiko! You have to take her to hospital immediately. - It's part of the game, you see? - Exactly. And when the finger's reattached, the Dwarves have won! - Victory for the Dwarves! - Yeah! I love you guys. You live the game. You're living it! We are all living it together right now! - Gundalf! Roderich! - Yes. Amonia. Let's go. We're on a mission. Heiko! What an amazing games night! - Don't forget your finger! - Thank you. - It's been an honor. - Bye. Oh my God! I have to use the bathroom. Really good woman! And? How was the meal? You had Vietnamese, right? Was it nice? The important question is how we get out of this, Elegoan. Everyone in Berlin is looking for us. First we have to get out of here. We should go out the back door. - Incognito. - How do you mean, incognito? This is stupid. Now we'll really stand out. We've just left a games evening. Just like normal. - Just walk like normal. - Okay, we need a plan. Honestly, guys, my plan is that we now part ways. Is that because of me? I can walk a few meters behind you. Really, have a normal date. I'm not here. I'm not here! Sunny, I'm so sorry how it went tonight. And I totally understand that... The question is what are you going to do to get out of this mess? I'm wondering about that, too. - Renzo? - There's no Renzo here! I'm Elegoan! - Should we run now? - Yes. Run! Shit! - Shit! - Shit! This way! Shit! Shit. Stay where you are! - They're shooting at us! - Shit! - Jesus Christ! I'm going to waste them! - You bastards! Fuck! Down there! The boat. - Come on! - Go, go, go! Quick! - Row! - Quick! - Milo, what are you doing? - To the right! Help! We've been hit! We're sinking! We're sinking! - Fuck! - Renzo, we'll get you. We'll get you all! Man! Quick, hurry up. We're sinking. The boat's full of water. - We've nearly made it. - Quick, quick. Paddle! Hurry, guys. Faster. Go on! Wait. Wait. I'll go first. - Renzo. Come on. - Help. Help. Hello. Look at them! Good evening. - What the hell is this? - It's a White Party. Just keep walking without attracting attention. Boy, that was embarrassing. This stupid costume is a waste of time. I should just have stayed at home. - I knew you'd be stress. I knew it! - I'm not! I'm sick of the sound of the stupid word. They were just shooting at us! We almost drowned. That's stress by my definition, okay? Sunny, stop moaning. It's really becoming a pain! You're still on your first date. Be more positive. Sorry, Renzo, what did you expect in this situation? Shall we discuss our star signs? - I'm a Gemini. - I'm not interested. I'm going home now. Hey, Sunny, you can't leave now. It's too dangerous on your own. I'm going home now, on my own. What is it? - I... - That's a fine automobile. It's very special. It's an E-Type, man. Do you know what this is worth? A gem like this could solve a lot of problems for us. I'm just saying. Forget it, Renzo. It's a really bad idea. Why? The Russians told us to bring something worth 150,000 euros. We'll only be even deeper in the mire. We can't just rob people. The owner is called Jan. Jan's a real asshole. So ethically speaking, it would be... totally okay. - Now that surprises me, Sunny. - Me too. Sounds like a serious plan. Now your date's really starting to make sense. It's fate. Do you get that? - I know a hotel in the mountains. - Where? There's snow there already. We can ski. - I've never skied. - Here it is. Here it is. - It's working out for you, Jan? - How do you know my name? We're like Batman. We fight for justice. So, Casanova, get out, leave the key, no stupid moves or you're dead. Please, let me live! Take her. Run to the river Spree and don't turn around, got it? Go! And what about me? You've officially been rescued by us. You can go. Yes. Ciao. I'm moving back to Hanover. Hey, guys. I have to admit that was kind of cool. Mr. Sorokin. Yes. I've got something very valuable for you. It's a surprise. We're on our way to you. See you soon. Ciao. It's working out. It's all working out perfectly. That's overdoing it a bit. - Shit, the cops. - Good evening, folks. Three in a two-seater? Go over the crossing, then pull over and show me your papers. It's okay, Paul, I know him. Hey, hello! Mirko? - Everything okay with you guys? - Everything's great. Steffi's the name. Steffi! I told you, man. Right then, enjoy your drive. Bye, Mirko. My name is Milo! Hey, Sammy... - Are you sure this is the place? - Absolutely. Ring the bell. It's nice here. I love bouncy castles. Do you bounce sometimes? No, we don't bounce. - Never? - Never. The car is in immaculate condition. Tip top. Where did you get the car from? Don't worry. I'm not talking to you. I'm talking to the men. Got it? Stay out of it. Without me, the car wouldn't even be here. - We're a team. Everyone can speak. - Equal rights. Yes. Equal rights. What a load of shit. You're progressive. Women's quota. Great! Fuck you! Where's the damn car from? Is that so hard to answer? Well? Shit. It's Kempa. Jesus, you don't mean to tell us that the car out there belongs to that guy? - It's complicated. - Fuck that. I don't need complicated. - Do you understand? - Tell me about it! Fucking idiots. Well, look who it is. Mr. Sorokin. Good morning. How's your father? Haven't seen him in ages. Nice place here. I have to come by with the kids. Forgive me for just barging in. Nice car, by the way. So well maintained. Is it your car, Kempa? Perhaps. These two fools tried to rob me. - I've suffered certain losses. - It's the same with us. Excuse me, Mr. Kempa, but you robbed me! Your men stole my pharmacy car. They stole your packages. Another word and I'll kill you. And I'll shoot you in the balls. No one will shoot here. Calm down. Take it easy. You don't understand what these two losers are up to. Like hell did we rob you! You think I'd pick a fight with a psychopathic Russian family? Who are you calling psychopathic? Suggestion: You let me have the nice automobile, and in return... you can have the girl. Well, the girl certainly is a factor. The girl has nothing to do with any of this. The girl is going to go home. - No one is going home. - Especially the girl. Excuse me, could you please stop calling me 'the girl'? It's discrimination! - Call me 'young lady'. - You're not that young anymore. Okay, everyone, stop. That's enough, okay? We had a deal, and I did my part. If there's anything to discuss, you and I can sort it out. Renzo and I can work to pay off your debt. For all I care, we'll work as call boys. Seriously? Or cut me up and sell my organs, but this young lady here... The young lady, she's leaving now. She has nothing to do with this. She was on a date with me! All this's going on and you go on a date? Yes. It was important to me. - Milo! - How was your date, if I may ask? - Romantic and stuff? - You know, it wasn't bad! But it's late now and I need to sleep. Can you end this drama now? - You speak Russian? - Yes. - My mother's from St. Petersburg. - St. Petersburg's a classy city. The White Nights are very beautiful. It's the cultural capital. Many museums. Hold on, what is this? A refugee reunion? Don't you realize these guys are screwing you? Just a moment. Just a second.... I have to take this quickly, okay? Bernadette, hello. Hello, my darling. Yes, I'm sorry. I know! Wait just a moment... It's extremely loud here. Can you switch off the blowers please? - It's a nuisance. - Switch it off, please. Hello, I'm back. Darling, listen. You start with season two now, and I'll come home. Yes. Darling, what can I do? It's just... Please don't. Don't shout. Please don't shout. I'm sorry. What else do you want? What else can I do? Berna, please. Bernadette? Darling? Fuck! - It's a shame what's become of him. - Poor bastard. Is she pissed! What shall I do? What will I do now? That woman is killing me. She's killing me, man. - Kempa, do you want the car? - What? - Do you want the car? - Yes. Yes, yes. That would be great. My wife would like that. That would be a nice gesture after tonight. Okay. And you romantics. I like you. I like you a little. And that's why you don't have to repay the money to me. I mean not today. Not now. You have until the end of the month. Is that a good idea? - Deal? - Great! - Yes, come on, be in a good mood. - Great! Renzo, it's the 28th today. So, how was your evening? It was pretty cool. - Thanks for picking us up. Kind of you. - Sure. You had a wild night out, huh? Kind of. How are you going to sort it out by the end of the month? That's our problem. Don't you worry. Heiko messaged us, the old dwarf. THAT WAS A MEGA GAMES NIGHT! Her finger's reattached! - Thanks again for the ride. - Yes, thanks. Sure, no problem. Maybe we can talk things over later. Over coffee? Milo, I still have so much to do before I leave, you know? Besides, I'm exhausted. - Bye. - Ciao, ciao. - Ciao. - Ciao. - Ciao. - Ciao. I'm so sorry. Really. I don't know what to say. Say, that car... The pharmacy vehicle... Where was it stolen? Here. Right around the corner from the 24/7. Right. I'm only asking because, there's a car on the other side of the road that looks almost identical. - There are lots of them in Berlin. - Really? Are you sure, Renzo? That jacket on the seat looks a bit like yours. It does bear a certain resemblance, yes. Fascinating. This is a total surprise. I have to admit, I'm finding this almost embarrassing. The car didn't get stolen at all. You just forgot where you parked, you idiot! I'm really sorry, Milo. The whole of last night... All that stress... - I could kill you! - Milo, it's great. Now we can return their package, and we've cleared our debt. It's great! - You do my head in. - Milo! Milo, it's great! Hey. I'm sorry. Hey, what's up, dude? I do not believe it! - Renzo? - Hey, Sunny. I'm not here. - Take no notice of me. - Have you gone completely mad? - How did you get up there? - I said take no notice of me! This is only about the snowflakes. Let them enchant you. It's magic. You guys are such total idiots. Hello, Milo. Did you think this up? Going on the roof? No, it was his idea. I wanted to ask if you want to see me again before you leave. Sorry. I really can't. But I'm going to go to my Dad's café later, to say goodbye to everybody. - You mean Café Maratonga? - Yes. You remembered the name. Not bad. Renzo, that's enough. You can stop. I'm not stopping. WELCOME TO MARATONGA DANCE CAFE Hello. Are you Sunny's father? I'm Milo. - Georg. I've heard all about you. - All good, I hope! Well, some of it. - Really nice place. Great venue. - Yes. Thanks. Only it's dead at night. We need a new program here. Is it true she's flying to Atlanta tonight? Ask her yourself. Hello, young man. All on your own? You remind me of a man. Roberto. My first Italian. Shall we dance? I thought what you said earlier was really nice. That you'd be a call boy for me. - I didn't mean it literally. - Still, it was kind of romantic. No one ever said that to me before. I was wondering whether to drive to the airport and dramatically run to the gate to try and stop you, like in a film. That isn't going to work, Milo. I'm definitely flying. I have to do it, for me. Do you understand? But I'll definitely come back to Berlin. In eight months. Maybe a little sooner. And during that time, you can think up the evening program. For our club here. It's going pretty well. Yes, it's great fun. - Renzo, catch me. - Go on then, I'll catch you. I've got you! I've got you, kid.
