I, Dr. Alan Stone, am guilty for underestimating the enigma that is the mind. But I am not guilty of the accusations leveled against me. I arrived at Ypsilanti State Hospital the summer of 1959. I'd left teaching to begin an ambitious study of delusional patients. Ypsilanti's most famous structure was the water tower referred to by the locals as the "Brick Dick." What did Lenny Bruce say? "In the halls of justice the only justice is in the halls." My defense for this hearing really a witch hunt begins my first night at Ypsilanti. Yes? Sorry to disturb you, Dr. Stone. My name's Benny. The attending physician is off-ward. We need help with a patient, Joseph Cassel he's down here on C-18. Alright. Alright, put it down, Mr. Cassel. You're... you're gonna be fine. I, Jesus of Nazareth spill my blood to save you. Away, you heathens who electrocute me. Who do you think you are? Thank you, Dr. Francisco. Saving someone who doesn't want to live. Some irony. You must be the new guy from MSU. - Stone, right? - That's right. No electrocution. Resurrection. What in God's name would cause you to miss Lenny Bruce's only night in Michigan? Well, actually, it was a patient's life. Of course. Who? Jesus Christ. Life in a mental hospital? Yeah. And that, Alan? That is life in a state mental hospital. Enjoy yourself, Ruth. Enjoy yourself. I don't want the children to hear. On second thought, maybe you were right. Sir! Excuse me, sir! You saved me from electrocution. My gratitude is infinite. Here is a present an aria for you, the sweetness of it all. Thank you. No, no, not giving it to you. Play it. Play it. I would really like to help you, Joseph. Please address me as my proper name Jesus Christ, the righteous one am I. Jesus. Died a long time ago, didn't he? You... you are mistaken. Listen, listen to Jussi Bjorling and Robert Merrill sing "Au fond du temple saint" from Bizet's "The Pearl Fishers." Good morning. I'm Dr. Stone. Please take a seat. No. Thank you, Mr. Benson. My name is Christ but I am not from Nazareth to be precise. Yes. Well, I'm sorry, but your actual name is Mr. Clyde Benson. So if I refer to you by your actual name you won't speak? Alright then, I think our time together is finished. You may go back to your ward. ♪ You'll wonder where the yellow went ♪ ♪ When you brush your teeth with wet cement ♪♪ Wet cement. Wet cement? - Funny, right? - That is funny. ♪ Brusha brusha brusha here's the new Ipana ♪ ♪ With the brand new flavor it's dandy for your teeth ♪ ♪ Yum pa pa pa pa ♪♪ My kids like that one. Two, two different toothpastes. Can there be two Jesus'? There can be but only one son of God. That's my point. Then why am I tortured by a pretender in our midst? - Mr. Cassel. - That's his name. But he goes by a fraudulent one, does he not? And now you are silent. Yes. Yes, now I am. Freud said there were two basic instincts. - What were they again? - You know the answer. Tell me anyway. Sex and aggression. What? Well, now I have two patients who believe they're Jesus Christ. What do you plan to do about that? Why don't you tell me, Ms. Summa Cum Laude? Will you ever get over that I'm smarter than you? No. Help me, my son. I, your Lord Christ the righteous one, beg thee to curtail this barbarism. They are frying my notes. Benny, what happened? What happened? What happened? Joseph got into a fight with Clyde Benson who also claims he's Jesus Christ. Joseph got upset and said there could only be one Jesus and then Benson broke his record. Dr. Francisco, is shock really necessary? Well, Mr. Cassel became uncontrollable over that broken vinyl. Is there a problem? Do you have some magical cure you're not sharing? No. Please allow me to leave Michigan and return to England. No. Be seated, please. So you've left academia to join us at Ypsilanti State Hospital. - Yes. - Welcome. Thank you, Dr. Orbus. Your papers make for interesting reading. What can I do for you? Well, I've received multiple grants from Michigan State to include schizophrenics in my identity studies. I need your support. What kind of support? Additional manpower. And your word that electroshock will never be used on my patients. Your article states. "Institutions are a warehouse for mental patients run like an automotive factory." Ah-ha. You don't think that sounds just a tad disrespectful if not insulting? I wrote truthfully. Ever worked in a state facility? I'm sorry, was I factually incorrect about the procedure? You haven't worked in a state facility. As someone who does, please, how would you suggest we offer more humane care to over 4100 patients we, a staff of five psychiatrists? I understand the scope of your problems, believe me I do. Your supervisor invited me here. Dr. Rogers. Certainly. Why not look to improve the quality of the care that you offer here? Because the methods that we use which are standard nationwide are not good enough? How did you refer to us? "Bureaucratic unfeeling conformists." Such restraint. I have no additional manpower. And if you create an unsafe environment for my patients you'll be removed. Dr. Rogers won't overrule me on that. I'm told I make a really good second impression. Ah, schizophrenia is a mental condition that makes it hard to tell the difference between what's real and not real uh, think clearly have appropriate emotional responses act normally in social situations. Okay, you are graduating from Eastern Michigan College with a degree in psychology. Full scholarship, excellent grades with a year hiatus. I had some family issues. I... I have recommendations. Oh, excellent ones. May I ask what kind of issues? Do I have to answer? No. No, you don't. You understand just how difficult working with paranoid schizophrenics can be. I know they lack inhibitions, and their speech is bizarre. Neological. Their words actually hide the meaning of what they're thinking. These patients may appear to see right through you pinpoint your doubts, your sexual impulses, your fears. How? They tend to be highly perceptive. For instance, you say that you have an issue they may intuit what it is or challenge you aggressively. It's very important for me to help people. Won't I learn how to do that if I work on this project? Probably. Why do you wanna work with paranoid schizophrenics? Because they're so lonely. Whatever happens.. You cannot be seduced into their world you will be unable to help them. And if it ever becomes too much, too personal too difficult, you will have to withdraw. Does that mean I'm hired? Yes, Ms. Anderson, you're hired. I'm Becky. I won't let you down. Find out if there are other patients in the Michigan Mental Health System who claim to be Jesus Christ. Alright. Leon Gabor. That's it? Ah, we've got three Cinderella's, two Eisenhower's one Duke Ellington, but only one more Jesus in Michigan. Good job. Good morning. My name is Dr. Stone. This is my research assistant, Ms. Anderson. Would you like to sit down, Mr. Gabor? - I'd like to get to know you. - Why? Maybe if I understand you better perhaps I can be of help to you. You wanna be my friend? I'd like to be your doctor. But not my friend. - Friendly doctor. - Why not my friend? Well, because there are certain boundaries between a doctor and his patient, Mr. Gabor. Address me by my righteous name. God, to you. I don't believe you're God. So you don't acknowledge who I am yet you want me to acknowledge who you are. Were you born a doctor, Stone? What is a stone? A rock? Was it even your birth name? No. What is your name? Who are you? I am a doctor. I'm here to treat you. And I really have no need to win a debate with you. So you won't tell me who is treating me yet you insist that I am not who I tell you that I am. Huh. Do you even believe in God? That's not easy to answer. Yes or no works for me. I believe in the mystery. But not God. - I believe in nature. - But not God? I believe in science, cause and effect. But not God. I find it very hard to believe in an all-powerful God who allows children to suffer.. Wars to be fought in his name. I went to war, set people free that I'd never met and now I'm being imprisoned by people that I do not know. I went to war too. Tried to save the lives of soldiers who were dying for people they didn't know either. And you liked that? Saving people? Make you feel good? Make you feel powerful? Yes. And how about you, Ms. Anderson? Do you believe in God? Yes. How are Ruth and the girls adjusting to the move? Well, Molly is questioning the duck-and-cover drill at the moment. Yeah, the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. Now, what's your project? Well, I interviewed three paranoids who believe they're Jesus Christ. I wanna put the three of them in a room.. And study their behavior. - Three Christ's? - Yeah. What do you think will happen? I don't have a clue. They aren't who they are, so who are they? - Yeah. - It's interesting. Maybe one of them will dominate the others force them to change their identities. Maybe... maybe we will learn enough that we can help them give up their delusions. Alright. Wait. Stop. You're not talking about the Holy Grail, right? Curing schizophrenia? It... it is an offshoot of Dr. Laing's work, no question about it. But it's an aggressive but humane approach. There's no shock, no drugs. Alan, you can't cross the boundaries of normal clinical protocol. Did you invite me here? Did you, did you encourage me to come here and do research, to work with the neglected those who truly need care? - The tough cases, right? - I did. - Yes, you did. - And I want you to. Good. But there are limits you can't exceed. I will respect them. My intention is to separate the three Christ's from the general population. Can you fund any shortfall in expenses? Your last paper attacks the very field that pays your bills. You want me to cover your overages? Will you? Can you get along with one of the "bureaucratic unfeeling conformists", Dr. Orbus? If you tell him not to treat my patients. Alan, I brought you here because I respect you, enormously. Please be careful. Joseph Cassel. Born in Canada to parents who were of normal height. Joseph left home, tried to enlist in the Army. They laughed at him, mocked him. He accused his wife, Eleanor, of poisoning him. He sat on her, pinned her arms to the ground and was arrested and hospitalized. Diagnosis, schizophrenia. Paranoid type. Prognosis for recovery, poor. Mr. Clyde Benson. Joined the Navy. Served in the Far East. His wife, Beverly, died a gruesome death following an abortion. Clyde complained of a horrid smell from the decaying fetus. He was arrested for drunkenness while he screamed that he was a filthy piece of stench. He was committed. Diagnosis, schizophrenia. Paranoid type. Prognosis for recovery... poor. Leon Gabor. Leon's mother was a religious fanatic. She'd lock Leon in a room when she went out to work as a scrubwoman. Against his mother's wishes, he joined the Army. He earned four ribbons, four combat stars for exposure to enemy fire. When he returned from the war his mother began to pray over him keeping him from sleeping. He became violent, told his mother she should start worshipping him, as Jesus. She tried to stop him, he threatened to strangle her Leon was committed. Diagnosis, schizophrenia. Paranoid type. Prognosis, questionable. Three delusional men who claim a religious identity are to be treated by a doctor who doesn't believe in organized religion. Will they be able to sit in the same room and get along? Will I be able to offer these men.. A means to find themselves.. To experience some companionship, hope, joy? Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. You all know me and my research assistant. Ms. Becky Anderson. Hello. And we also have Neil Byers and Louis Bowman who are helping us out today. - Is that working? - Yes, sir. Then go ahead and start it. Thank you, Louis. Alright. I have transferred each of you from the general population. Ward C-18 here to D-23. You will be the only patients here. We will have our meetings in this room in the hope that you will come to a better understanding of yourselves. - Joseph, any questions? - Are you hard of hearing, sir? No. Why do my requests fall on deaf ears? You will note my one and rightful name. Please address me as Jesus Christ of Nazareth. Much obliged. Did our father send a boy to do a man's job? No, he did not. Clyde, you understand why we're here? A... are you hard of hearing, sir? - No, Clyde, I am not. - Please address me correctly. Ah, my name is Christ, if you must know but I am not from Nazareth. Ha, ha, ha. A rigid dupe faith. Well, you wouldn't be working for Senator McCarthy now, would you, sir? On the news today... He's dead, you idiot. Shaking off. I'm shaking off all of your negativity and all of your squelches, all of your squelching all of your squelches. Your ferocity may be the source of this odor of decaying flesh. Alright, why don't we talk about where you were born about your families? Leon, would you like to start us out, please? Take the girl and stop her from looking at me. There is desire in her wet parts. I must push back the missile. That will help. I am writing Dr. Orbus to request a transfer to England. Ah! Okay. ♪ Au fond du temple saint ♪ Shut up. Knock it off. Knock it off! Do you see the way that your sister crosses and uncrosses her legs? Lust creeps in and out of her. Stop it or I will not be responsible for her moist response to my scent. Her scent is pleasing. Ms. Anderson is assisting me. Oh, I'll bet she is. She is raping my thoughts. They are my thoughts, you did not ask my permission and you cannot have them. You're right. You're right. I'm... I'm recording our conversations with your permission so that I can study why each of you believes you are Jesus Christ. And you will do this because you are my patient and I am your doctor. So what makes you a doctor, Stone? A piece of paper? If I were to burn it, would you still be a doctor or would you be a fake, a phony, a paper mache? I am who I am. Well, then why do you need a piece of paper to prove to others who you are? You are not Mozart your notes don't ring true, Mr. Leon Gabor. Address me as your Lord your God, your King of Kings! By all means, be who you want to be. We do not have false hollowed out gods in Great Britain. Oh, you're from Canada, you midget. - No, no, no. No! No! Scha... Schafer is the one beer to have.. Let go! Let go! Let go! Okay. Calm down. Come on, come on, come on. No! No! Stop! Let go! Let go! Let go! Stop! Stop! It's okay. It's alright. The orderlies must be inside. They'll inhibit the patients, you can't do that. The patients' safety is my responsibility and mine alone. Not Dr. Rogers'. Either the orderlies are inside, or I'll have to terminate the experiment. Fine. Got it. I am planning on publishing the results of my work. I would like to have the backing, if possible... No, you won't. I will not have you doing a hatchet job on Ypsilanti. - I have no intention of that. - This is not a debate. There will be no paper. I don't know why I'm getting so worked up. My physician says that the stress kills. Maybe I should meditate or something. I don't mean to be such an obstacle to everything you propose, I truly don't. In fact.. These are letters from patient Cassel.. And, uh, perhaps they'll be of some use to you. You know what would be nice? If they could just sit, play cards together. You should go home, Becky. I'm, uh, not finished. Oh. This is your new research material? - That's not what it... - "Sick Comics." Mike Nichols, Elaine May, Lenny Bruce? Why are you so interested in Lenny Bruce? 'Cause he's warped. He's funny, he tells the truth. And he's from Brooklyn. Is it possible to really understand someone else's delusion? I think the closest I ever got was when I experimented with LSD. I can heat up dinner if you're hungry. No, thanks. I almost wish I was working on this project with you instead of grading chemistry papers. Hey, it's brave and important, what you're doing. Teacher says, "Take your medicine." Alright, Ms. Anderson. Session One. November 11th, 1959. Problematic. Oh, Leon. Leon, Leon. Grand Inquisitor. He will debate, confront, and taunt you wanting to provoke an inappropriate response but that is his means of protection. His attraction to Becky has thrown him off stride. It sets off a lot of mixed sexual feelings. Come on, Pogo Stick, I'll be late. - I'm not a pogo stick. - Pogo. - Dad, tell her to stop. - Stop. I'm trying to make her stronger because the boys call her four eyes, and she cries. Which boys? I'll have a chat with the principal. Shirley, sweetheart, I call you names too, you know. Yeah, but I like when you do it. - Why? - Because it's fun with you. If you know who you are.. It doesn't matter what the boys say. Here. Listen to your father. For Dr. Orbus, kindly, sir. He has yet to respond, which is most disrespectful. How is a man supposed to live away from his English home? Like the rest of us. Please, good doctor, don't let him destroy my letters and send me down the drain with them. ♪ Rotor Rooter that's the name ♪ ♪ And away the troubles down the drain ♪ ♪ Roto Rooter sewer service ♪♪ My good doctor, someone, and I'm not saying who stole my glasses. They weren't stolen, they were broken. And you had a fight with Leon. Alright, Clyde... would you like to come over and sit next to Joseph? Would you do that? It would make me very happy if you did that. Please, could you come? Come on! Thank you. Clyde, what do you think about Joseph's claim to be Jesus Christ? I am the Lord God but call me what you will. Joseph is, uh... very nice but... little. But duplicity runs in his veins. A fraudulent one is he. Joseph? Are you alright with Clyde sitting next to you? There is room for this gentleman just not in my chair, if you please, Mr. Clyde Benson. My odor returns. Keep your distance. Ho! - I don't smell anything. - Nor I. Well, it's very deep, sir, it's very deep. Electronic interference upstairs another Shocky Boy. Dr. Francisco powers up his Frankenstick. Welcome back, Leon. Okay, today's goal is to use your words. Gabor, don't punch our Cassel. Exactly. Do you have a headache, Leon? No, sir, just shaking it off the cosmic energy for the hollowed out gods and I do not wish to have any disfigured bodies being carried out of this place. You are a dupe, a re-rise hick next to me. Be careful. Someone, I'm not saying who, stole my deck of cards. What are you writing? Notes for Dr. Stone. Will those notes contain my thoughts? Yes. And would those notes, my thoughts belong to you or to me? To Dr. Stone. He owns my thoughts. Well, I think he owns the notes. No, no. No. No closer. You frighten everyone. You made your point now go back and sit down. May I? What, the pen? It is still warm from your hand filled with my thoughts.. Which you have taken from me. They're your thoughts. No one here owns them, only you. You're right. Lavender. You will not be the center of attention in England with me. I am not engaged to you, sir but to the one who makes flowers grow in the concrete desert. The reason I'm having these meetings is there can only be one Jesus. True? - Only one God. - One God, two rerise hicks. So if we don't start responding to names. Shocky Boy will rev up his generators again? No Shocky Boy, no. If, if you spend time together you don't fight with each other, maybe play cards. Stoney Boy. When you finger fornicate your wife is it Ms. Becky's face that you see? Is she your orifice to disfigure? True love cannot be denied. Thank you, Leon. The topic of conversation today is roots. Is it possible that my phonograph and my records could be brought here? Because if music were playing now.. We would all be divine. No opera. That's quite interesting, the dynamic. - Challenging, as well. - Definitely. And they haven't been fighting even while living in the same ward. But? I need to speed things up. I am not going to, uh, confront them anymore I'm going to encourage them to engage each other. Friendly. Let them run the meetings. You know, chairman for a day. I like that. Yeah. You and Orbus getting on? Funny you should ask that. I need to avoid any conflict with him about publishing the results of my work. And you want.. It to be my idea. Yeah, well, just getting along. Alan, you are entirely predictable but always surprising. How is that? My nature? The transcripts you requested. Oh, thanks. Thank you. Something else on your mind? What Leon says about you thinking about me when.. Leon responds to you and he notices that I respond to you and vice versa. He's testing us. But don't worry, we will never cross that line. I know that. Very kind of you to invite us, Mrs. Rogers. Oh. Vicky, please. He admires your husband. And they worked so closely together in Korea. Where's Dr. Orbus' wife? Oh, that's very sad. She passed almost two years ago it's a very difficult time for him. Drinks have arrived, ladies. - Thank you. - Your timing is impeccable. Dr. Stone, there's an urgent phone call from the hospital. Get off of me! Take his arm and pull him down. Hi. He refuses to get out of the shower. I wouldn't let him be forcibly removed. - That's what you wanted, right? - Yeah. No, that's great. Thank you. Can you get me transferred to laundry? The smells in this kitchen are nauseating. Well, we can discuss that, but you need to come out now. Well, you don't have to believe in God to fear the Devil's Frankenstick I'll tell you that. I know, but I promise you I won't let. Shocky Boy power up his Frankenstick. Stay away. I don't, I don't wanna infect you with my stench. I don't infect that easily. You stay away. I'm alone in here. Leave me alone. I'm alone in here. I don't wanna smell. I don't wanna smell! Okay. Don't move. You don't have to move. You don't have to move. I'm just gonna turn the water off. Don't move. Don't move. Don't move. Don't move. Don't move. - Stay where you are. - You don't have to move. You're gonna be okay. Here you go. There you go. Here you go. Here you go. Yeah. Yeah. Beverly, Beverly called me Death. She died from my seed. No. No, no, no, no, no. Please don't hurt yourself again. Please. Do you have a picture of Beverly? I hear she was very beautiful. She was so beautiful. I have a picture in my box. Aw, yeah, she is beautiful. Becky, what are you doing here? - Ah, I'm sorry. I.. - For what? I was out with friends and... and I couldn't sleep. - What is this? - Um.. Just some scribbles trying to make sense of our sessions. May I? It's good. Yeah. You're starting to get a sense of paranoids. They need the space. "The perimeter of safety" is how you described it. That's what I said. - Dr. Stone. - Yup? You mentioned that you had taken LSD. How did it help you to understand your patients better? I lost the sense of my own physical boundaries depersonalization. I... I... I hallucinated like they do, I think. Should I try it? Would it help me understand them better also? No. Unless I'm there to watch over you. Is everybody happy? - Yes! - Yes! - You need some sleep. - Yeah. I'll just get a shower. Alright, let's see. Shirley, did you get your lunch together? - I'm not Shirley. - I'm Shirley. Wait a minute, are you sure you're Shirley and not Molly? Yes, dad. Are you, are you sure that you're not Shirley? - You're silly. - No. And you're Molly. I am not. If... if I changed your name, are you still Shirley? - Of course, Daddy. - I know why you did that. Why? It's to teach Shirley to not be hurt by the names from the boys. Mmm! Smarty pants! I got two smarty pants' here. I can't believe it. Wow, you are so smart. Okay, get your coats on. Why won't Dr. Orbus respond to my manly letters? - I don't know. - Are my words offensive? Be careful what you say or Shocky Boy will light you up. - Did he light up Benson? - No. No, he did not. No, Clyde is feeling much better now. Can't the doctor from near heaven urge the highest Dr. Orbus to hear me out? How else will I return to England? I'll rot in here. I'll urge him to read your letters, okay? My eternal gratitude, my son. Words cannot convey what notes can say. Much obliged. Hinkley news flash the doctor was saved from stench by your humble reporter. He was most kindly. Good to have you back, Clyde. Alright. Gentlemen... this... is now the chairman's chair. From now on, I want one of you to lead each of the meetings and starting with a song. Give it to me, I'll take it. You know, that's a good idea, but I think we should have a vote for the first chairman. Truth is a chairman. I nominate Ms. Anderson. - She's a woman. - I can attest. I nominate Joseph, on Joseph's request. All favor. Unanimous. Congratulations. Chairman Joseph. Please. Good. Now let's start with a song. Why don't we do that, "America the Beautiful." An English melody. No, it isn't. And it isn't opera. Uh, this type is too small for Jesus. I.. ♪ Oh beautiful ♪ ♪ For spacious skies ♪ ♪ For amber waves of grain ♪ ♪ For purple ♪ ♪ Mountain majesty ♪ ♪ Above the fruited plain ♪ ♪ America ♪ ♪ America ♪ ♪ God shed his grace on thee ♪ ♪ And crown thy good ♪ ♪ With brotherhood ♪ ♪ From sea to shining sea ♪♪ Yeah. Joseph's been writing to you for months now. Can you respond to his letters? I don't have time. And I wouldn't know what to say. But he wants access to you you're the most important authority figure here. Look, I promised him that you would respond. Did you? Well, that's a pickle. Look, they're starting the meeting without prompting. Oh, the LSD's starting to work. It's a small dose, the effects will wear off quickly. ♪ Onward Christian soldiers ♪ ♪ Marching as to war ♪ ♪ With the cross of Jesus ♪ Leon, why are you here? It's me, Becky. Leon is in there. That's your voice, but not your body. It's me. It's me. Use your instincts. It's me. I'm right here. Okay? I believe it's you. I can't tell where you end and I begin. You're okay, you're fine. Oh, hi, honey. - Hi. - I'm Ruth. This is my assistant, Becky. Thank you, nurse. Becky, you know, when we first met, uh I asked you about your family issues and you preferred not to speak about them. Drink this. Some coffee, you'll feel better. Nothing you say will change my opinion of you. Do you have mental illness in your family? Yes. My brother. It spiraled out of control? Yes. Did he take his life? He did. And that's why you wanna do this kind of work? - To help people, as you say? - Yes. Yeah. That's good. That's a real good thing. You know, because... because I didn't help him or my mom and everything fell apart. I'm so sorry about your brother. But you can't live for someone who doesn't want to or prevent them from taking their lives. And you can't blame yourself for surviving. I know this from experience. The yeti tribe is believed to live in the Himalayan mountains. It's a matriarchal society where the yeti woman is worshipped as a goddess. No one's actually seen the yetis but their footprints have been found on a number of expeditions to Mount Everest. The female yeti or Madame Yeti is said to possess extraordinary strength. And is able to lift animals weighing hundreds of pounds. Well, it's new, right? Maybe a breakthrough. Progress, for sure. Is that why you wanted to see me? Yes. Absolutely. You know, Joseph has been writing letters to Dr. Orbus who hasn't responded. That's customary. What if I respond as Dr. Orbus? Really? Why would you do that? Because they're hurt and angry. No one responds to their letters. You know, I could even give them some suggestions that might modify their behavior. I don't understand. Why are you moving away from identity study? This is a radical, untried approach. These patients have been responsive to suggestions. Why don't we just go with that, and push it further? Alan, you're asking my approval to get directly involved in their delusional systems. You promised me not to cross the boundaries of normal clinical protocol. Jonas Salk infected patients with viruses to test the polio vaccine, right here. - In Ypisilanti in the '40s. - That's correct. Yes. Very risky. Madame Curie, the same thing, who worked with... with x-rays. No risk, no... no breakthroughs. And if you do that, you'd force me to cut off your funding. When's the next board meeting? Dr. Abrams arrives in the fall. Might be wise to get her opinion the recognized expert in this field. Alan... I'm disappointed in you. Leon, you have a visitor. That's my mother. Why are you mad at me? Why are you mad at me? Mrs. Gabor, please. What have I done? I'm all alone. Mrs. Gabor, calm down. Please. Alone, do you hear? Mrs. Gabor. What I have done to you? No! No! No! I was called to attend a patient. I'll treat him. I'll treat him. Shocky Boy, Shocky Boy, Shocky Boy. He's agitated, incoherent, and needs to be controlled. I said I will treat the patient. What is and not a sin of all the different, the different and the, things of the all the different ways in which which God would look seen through the eyes of the devil. Leon. If you can calm yourself.. I can take the straps off. Madame.. Madame Yeti. Who's Madame Yeti? My wife. You told me that you were married to the Blessed Virgin Mary. No. No, no. Madame Yeti. Or Madame R.I. Dung. You can see her on Channel One. She said that I was a pile of truthful idle dung. Doctor, Dr. Righteous Idle Dung and I... I accepted. It is comical to a certain degree. What kind of doctor is he, you might ask? - A doctor of shit. - A doctor of shit. You can call me Rex, or Dung. Doctor... doctor, Dr. Shit or, or Dr. Dung. Mm. I like it. What, you don't? Well, the purpose is for Leon to give up his Christ delusion, correct? Yes. I think you shouldn't write to Leon as Dr. Orbus. It's too late for that, I'm not going to discuss... I think it should be written as Madame Yeti. Isn't Leon more likely to follow a suggestion from a woman, his wife, than a man? This... this is what I came up with. "My dear husband, I have been aware on Channel One "that you have been watching me. "And now, what a nice letter you've sent me. "I will meet you tomorrow at 5 o'clock at the lake if it pleases you. Fondly, Madame Yeti Woman." It's good. No, it's better than good. This is really spot on. Uh, now, Joseph and Clyde. You should write as Dr. Orbus. I was killed last night and got another body. You look the same to me. Pertaining to the internal construction it is different. I don't see it. Mr. Cassel, do not put the penis in the wrong hole or else you'll wind up a disfigured midget. No offense. None taken, but there's Ms. Anderson to consider. She's here. I can attest. If I have hurt your feelings through rude expression it was due to using a word that Mr. Cassel can more readily understand and strike at. Please forgive the expression.. And the messenger. My feelings aren't hurt. No tears. I can attest. Who's leading today? Mr. Benson, you wanna start us off? No. No, I will not. Okay. Okay. Okie doke. Ah, that's better. That's very considerate, Leon. Three Christ's session, September 10th, 1960. - Mr. Chairman. - Sure. May I offer Dr. Orbus' response to your letters? No. No, you may not. Thank you, good doctor, for calling this most special meeting. Madame Yeti. Mr. Benson, would you please refrain from hawking merchandise? Psychology used to agitate his negative. Do you have a, a time piece that might be borrowed? Sure, of course. Clyde, if you can refrain from showering more than once a day I will be willing to discuss your request to work in the laundry rather than the kitchen. Sincerely yours, Dr. Orbus. Icily light sensibly right crystal clear. Crisp refresher. Sir, it's 6:00 p.m. and Leon hasn't showed up at the lake. Where is he? He's in the bathroom masturbating again. Do you think Joseph and Clyde would be more suggestible? I sure hope so. Ballantine, Ballantine, beer. "As you know, Joseph, I don't share your beliefs "that our institution is an English stronghold. "If you can visit the Chapel, maybe yourself "with the teachings of the church more directly. Yours truly, Dr. Orbus." And you've been sending copies of all these letters to Dr. Orbus and Dr. Rogers? Yes. What have you been writing up for Leon? Uh, I told him that Madame Yeti was disappointed but would give him one more chance to meet by the lake at 5:30 tomorrow. That's good, I like it. "Dear Dr. Orbus, I do believe showering three times a day "will lead to a diminishment of the sewer gas "to which I am prone. "Farts, sir, are a questionable fact of life "but stinking is vile. Christ, not of Nazareth." What? I'm impressed. That I've abstained from the shower? Has my stench returned? No. What do you think? Maybe. "Dr. Orbus, a man must have a hard-on "in the presence of a Ms. Anderson. "Therefore, I formally request that I am transferred "back to my native country of England. Yours truly, Joseph Cassel." I do not share your belief that our institution is an English stronghold nor that you are a citizen of England. Bill, the Christ's are being responsive to my suggestions. If this continues, this could be a real breakthrough especially with Leon. So please, hold off on doing anything till the meeting with Dr. Abrams. Okay, to Joseph. Uh, perhaps you can persuade Leon and Clyde to join you in your church and share what you have been learning. Gentlemen, my body shall be at the chapel shortly alone. It would give me a supreme sensation of good fortune if you fellows, whose corpus are here, were to join me. You wouldn't be alone then. Dr. Stone. Leon is a no-show. - Okay. Thank you. - Okay. What do you think, third time a charm? Yup. Leon has been waiting at the lake since 3:30 p.m.. Punctual. Madame Yeti. Ma... ma... madame. Ah, Dr. Stone. Please, have a seat. Thank you. Read that, if you wouldn't mind, please. What do you think? Why are you responding to Joseph's letter? I could say because he's writing to me. But you've never done it before. I am wondering if I should be more involved going forward. I did quite a bit of research in my early days. Some of it very forward-thinking. We could work even closer together, as partners. Congratulations. Yeah. So.. What do you think of my letter to Joseph? I think it's ill-advised at this moment. It's not consistent with the voice I've been using. As me. Yes. As you. The more you include me, the more you involve me the better equipped I'll be to stop Dr. Rogers from shutting you down. Leon. Wanna chair the meeting today? Everyone in favor, vote aye. - Nay. - Aye, aye, aye. Unanimous, congratulations. ♪ Oh say can you see.. ♪♪ So it says in the introduction here there's ridicule against my reincarnation. "Three mental patients each claiming to be Jesus Christ have been brought together... ". "Today one-one subject has changed his belief "about being Christ and has taken on another another false identity, and this patient... ". "This patient claims the other two are subject "to electronic interference and.. "The third patient thinks the other two are crazy." They are in a mental hospital. Sir, there-there appears to be indirect warped psychology here. My name, Dr. Righteous-Idealed Dung it's-it's not-it's not, it's not here. Yeah, well, your names were withheld to protect your privacy. Well, I wish they had been included. Because it would have changed the entire picture pertaining to my manliness. I think you all know Dr. Orbus. Continue, please. What was it you were talking about? They were just giving their opinions of the article. And what a wonderful article it is. Carry on. Anyone? Well, I just meant to drop off the letters. I will say how much I am enjoying our correspondence and terrific progress being made. Thank you, doctor. My letters. No, we'll pass them out tomorrow. That's fine. Tomorrow we'll do that. I wish to speak to God Morphey Anderson alone by myself, with a pipe organ. Three men who think they're Jesus borders on the comical. Thanks for coming over. It's really helpful for my meeting with Dr. Abrams. Uh, we need to do that rewrite for Orbus this time. Um, I already did. Okay. Oh, you started the party without me. I'm fine. I'm fine. Just some fun with the girls. Hi, Becky. Hi, Mrs. Stone. - I'll get some coffee. - That would be divine. Alan is a prince. You know that. I... I really should go. He wasn't born one. You should know the man and not the myth although they're largely the same. Come. Sit. His mother drove him to excel at school, to become a doctor. But not just any doctor, a great one. She saved every penny she had to send him from Berlin to London. Kid, with no money in a country on the verge of war with his homeland and he, speaking in a very conspicuous German accent. It wasn't very pretty. But he moved to Brooklyn. And then the war broke out. He enlisted in the Army, served in the front lines in Europe and then later in Korea. He came back different. He never spoke about it, not a word. After the war, I was his young research assistant at Michigan State. Those days that became nights, that became mornings. It was intoxicating intimate, erotic. I just had a drink. Actually, quite a few. I don't know what I was thinking. This must stop. No more drinking, alright? I will do anything for you, for the kids but this will end, now! Your article's attracting quite a bit of attention, and ink. Predominantly negative, Dr. Abrams. Bill, I wanted to meet the mind that dreamt this experiment up. I'm honored. You are writing letters as someone other than yourself to patients. Yes. Bill, you're not on board with this? That's correct. And yet there is objective evidence that there is progress being made with your patients in many areas. Bill? Doctor, I... I'm really exploring new territory... I know what you're doing and I probably know why you're doing it. What's your greatest anxiety? That we, as a profession warehouse drug and restrain patients rather than treat them. I don't think it's good enough, not by a long shot. Do you? You're telling me and the entire psychiatric hierarchy to go fuck itself. I like that. Dr. Stone has agreed to let us talk alone. Well, I must admit, madame, that the beaming smile on your face is something that I haven't quite experienced before in my life. That's very kind of you. What did you want to talk about? I share Dr. Rogers' concern about what your involvement with the Christ delusional systems is doing to them, to you your judgment and your conclusions. The work I'm doing with the four Christ's is really si.. Three Christ's, the work I'm doing with the three Christ's is singular. Four. I... I meant three. I know what you meant. Do you? Yes. Things are getting blurry. You have a look of a man on a journey, a descent. Did you, when you were doing your most demanding work? Yes. There's a poem by Emily Dickinson. But Let A Splinter Swerve. It's about the power of an original idea how it can move mountains and leave a debris field in its wake. Your work is novel, brilliant and dangerous. You decide if the gains outweigh the obvious risks. Don't you want to leave Ypsi and resume your life outside? If you can use your given name, control yourself this could happen. I won't, I won't touch it no matter how close it comes. I've thought of you nightly. Making emissions into your squelch chamber pleasantly. And you me? Leon, there are boundaries that must be observed. Yes, there are boundaries. In Europe, during the war duping caused me to degenerate with a couple of soldiers in a clubhouse. And while I was kneeling I noticed this boy's feet. They were enormous compared to mine. He did it to me twice. I was so frightened that I ran out of there screaming with my hair standing on end. You know this feeling. How? Did it happen to you? Rape? You don't have to say. God knows all. But you can't lie, can you? I don't lie. You are full of truth. Full of what makes the desert bloom. And I, humbly, sad that I am, will do my best to honor your sadness with what little I have to offer. Pipe organs can help if you need to shake it off. I should have kept my distance. I crossed a boundary, didn't I? Yes. But sometimes we have to follow our instincts. Dr. Abrams left it up to me to decide whether to continue or not. I'll carry on. Will you? Can you? I will. There is one thing I would like to do for Leon. God Morphey heard me. ♪ Chock Full o'Nuts ♪ ♪ Is that heavenly coffee ♪ ♪ Heavenly coffee ♪ ♪ Heavenly coffee ♪ ♪ Chock Full o'Nuts ♪ ♪ Is that heavenly coffee ♪ ♪ Better coffee a millionaire's ♪ ♪ Money can't buy ♪ ♪ Chock Full o'Nuts ♪ ♪ Is a heavenly coffee ♪ ♪ Heavenly coffee ♪ ♪ Heavenly coffee ♪ ♪ Chock Full o'Nuts ♪ ♪ Is that heavenly coffee ♪ ♪ Better coffee a millionaire's ♪ ♪ Money can't buy ♪ ♪ Chock Full o'Nuts ♪ ♪ Is that heavenly coffee ♪ ♪ Heavenly coffee ♪ ♪ Heavenly coffee ♪ ♪ Chock Full o'Nuts ♪ ♪ Is that heavenly coffee ♪♪ Carefully now. My toenail. Careful. Oh! Leon's mother passed away. I never had a mother. Thank you, gentlemen, very much. Joseph. Please, have a seat. Sorry, should I address you as Jesus Christ? If you must, but that's just between us, please. Because I am the righteous one. Very good. I've got great news. Dr. Stone has encouraged me to be more involved with you because of the progress you've made. You are going to tell me that I am free to leave the hospital today. Why don't we start by you telling me a little bit about yourself? Have I done what you've requested in your letters? Well.. Have I done what you've requested? I... I suppose you have done as we've requested. In your letters you said I'd be free to go to England. Can I now? Uh, no, you can't now. In your letters you said I would be free to go if you would... Actually, I allowed Dr. Stone to answer for me in those letters because he was working so closely with you. You asked Dr. Stone to lie to me for you? Allow me to clarify. When you've improved much more than you have now much more, then we can consider your release. Well, now, how... how how can I, anyone know when you are lying and when you are not? I'm telling you the truth. So you won't unchain me. I can't now, but I could. Why do you twist the truth with me, Dr. Orbus? Did I lie to you? This is a very serious decision you're asking... Do I lie to you? A serious man can only take so much before he shatters. Please. Okay. Please, if you'll just sit down... Let me go. Let me go! You must now or everything will fall apart. The center will not hold. Orderlies! You do not know what's happening because you are murdering my mind. - Call Dr. Francisco! - No! Dr. Stone. No. No. I'm stopping this. No more. - Hey! Hey! Hey! - You are not authorized. You are not authorized to do this! Stop! Clear! Hey. How's Joseph? Um, he's still heavily sedated. Are you making fun of me? No, I'm... I'm, I had a concussion. You're dressing like a mental patient. Yeah. Who are you? You're not Dr. Stone, you changed your name. Why? To avoid being judged. Your fake name judges you. You couldn't protect Joseph. What makes you think you'll protect me? No one is going to shock you. A gowned patient can't protect anyone. Dr. Stone, how are you feeling? Just peachy keen. Perhaps you should go back to your room and convalesce in comfort. You're interested in my well-being? - Yes. - Why? There's pressure on me to remove you from the hospital. Me? You interfered with an authorized medical procedure.. I didn't authorize anything. Not by me. No. Patient Cassel assaulted me. He was out of control. He had no business being there. What were you doing there, anyway? Assisting you. If I need your help, I'll let you know. Dr. Stone, this afternoon was an unfortunate incident I'm offering you an olive branch. Oh, I'm fine. My music. Could you play my music? The devil tortured me. And he said you were Judas. You wrote the letters? - Yes. I wrote the letters. - I knew that. Why? To save me, not to hurt me. To help you, always. Your heart is pure. Ooh! Listen to this aria. There are two men consumed with love for the same woman Princess Leila. They swear never to see her again and celebrate their friendship like you and Gabor and Ms. Anderson. Becky bought these. She thought they'd make you happy. Becky. Can you control yourself with Dr. Orbus? You must. You cannot give him a reason to be punitive. Three men saying they are Christ. Clyde said "So comical." But now I have a new mission to save you from the devilish one. Not a comedy. I'm sorry, Dr. Stone? Please. What is it? I've been ordered to escort you off hospital grounds. - Orbus? - Yes. - Now? - Yes. Immediately. I know how unfair this is. How wrong this is. Watch over them. Joseph. I wanted to apologize for the other day. I thought I met the devil. He was an orderly in Kalamazoo. I was wrong. I was hoping we could get a fresh start. Would you allow me that? You want me to reinstate your privileges against Dr. Orbus' will on your project which in my opinion employs questionable tactics? Yes! I can't do that on a permanent basis. What can you do? Let's sit and talk. About what? Whatever comes to mind. My mind or your mind? In deference to Dr. Abrams, I can hold a hearing to adjudicate the matter. Great. Great. That is great. Can... can you suspend the dismissal order against me until the hearing? Yes. That would be the proper course of action prior to a judgment. Great! - Who are you calling? - Dr. Orbus. So you can reinstate my privileges. Where is Dr. Stone? He'll no longer be with us. - Is he alive? - Yes, of course. Well, how do I know that? May I see him? - No, not now. - Why? I'm trying to explain. He's being replaced. By whom? By me. May we go to the bell tower? I want to show you God's view. Yeah, tell him to call back right away. Yeah. Thanks so much. Now, you stay out of trouble till the hearing. Can you do that for me? Why don't you come with me down to.. We'll drive down there right now. You can talk to Orbus in person and then there's no miscommunication. Bill, can you do this for me, please? May I speak to you alone? Are you afraid of me, Dr. Orbus? You, you are the most powerful man in this institution. No, I'm not afraid of you, no. Can we speak confidentially? - Doctor, I um... - Benny, I won't hurt him. Um, can we have some privacy, Benny? - Dr. Orbus... - I wasn't asking. Did you make Dr. Stone disappear? No. No, and I... I think with my supervising you directly you have a more experienced doctor at your disposal. Can you make me disappear? I'm not... I'm not sure I... I know what you mean. Whenever you want, you can run electricity through my brain, tie me in knots pour poison into my veins, make me forget my name. And now there is no one to protect me. You have no arms, Dr. Orbus. Do you know that? Benny! Benny! How can you soar when you have no arms? And to think, I was chosen to save you. England. God, no! No. No! Get a doctor. Get a doctor. Dr. Abrams was prophetic. Let A Splinter Swerve. The power of an original thought.. And the debris that it leaves in its wake. When we first met, you saved me from electrocution. My gratitude was infinite. It has grown with time. My mission is to repay your kindness your caring, your love. "PS. "My Pearl Fishers album is now yours. "Don't scratch it and you too will soar. England!" Ruth and the kids were buffeted by everything that I did everything that happened. My loss was theirs as well. All this preparation. I'm gonna just tell the truth. Keep it simple, direct. The following allegations have been lodged. A man has died, that's a fact, not an allegation. Alan, did you contravene a direct order that Dr. Orbus gave? He's dead. Why? Was he terrified of... of being shocked again? Dr. Francisco was treating an agitated patient. According to your report, it says that his final words were.. "You have no arms. How can you soar with no arms? "So to think that I, Joseph, was chosen to save you. England." - What do you think that means? - Gibberish. Why? Why are you making this so difficult? He said something. You didn't hear it. Our job is to interpret and understand them. And because you were so possessed by the excitement of having your name in the headlines, you missed it. You missed the cue to stop him in the moment before he jumped. What he was trying to say to you is that your spirit cannot soar and that he was chosen to save you. He died for your sins, Dr. Orbus, like Jesus Christ. Neologisms. Nonsense. Bill, he wanted to take over this project. He wanted to bask in whatever glory came out of it. And because of that, he started making terrible decisions. He told Benny that he... he wanted to be alone with Joseph up in the bell tower. I don't have to listen to this Jabberwocky. No, you do not. Bill, you gotta stop this tragically insecure doctor from overmedicating any more patients, shocking... Enough! You want it polite or straight? - Straight. - You're fired. Your experiment is terminated. Dr. Orbus will stay in his current position. That's what the report will read. Alice has indeed fallen down the rabbit hole. Alice is still in terra firma. Dr. Orbus will retire within six months. So he can maintain his dignity? He has been stripped of all decision-making authority by Bill who still believes in you. I would like to arrange a transfer to New York for you, your family and your patients.. What? I would like you to continue to explore identity issues. I can think of nothing more important. I admire your empathic approach to schizophrenics. Although, any cure seems very far away. Let me be frank with you. I now have very serious doubts about my approach. Is manipulation in the service of therapy proper? Is lying in any form acceptable? Is giving hope when it's highly unlikely is... is that justifiable? I.. I, for one, won't sit in judgment. You think your patients will continue in New York? I don't know. Why don't you ask them? I'm asking if you want to continue our work in New York City. If you feel that our time together has been of value... Leon, you don't wanna go back to that crowded main ward. Come with us, please. It's all over. The water lake is frozen. My feet are... are stuck in wet cement. Wet cement. I cannot move. It's alright then. Leon, I don't want to leave you and Clyde here alone. I won't do that. I wanna help you and care for you. I miss Joseph too. My heart aches for him, okay. Alan Stein. My birth name. Alan Stein. My parents had a Jewish name. They were murdered by the Nazis. Before they were killed they changed my name to protect me. They had me smuggled out of the country. Then you will be my friend? I am your friend. By the grace of Jesus Christ, you are saved. I, Rex, son of God baptize you. Dr. Dung. Now let's go, I'm freezing. Yeah, this way. Come. Come on. Come on, we'll go back. We'll get warm. Mr. Benson, we are going away with our new friends. God Morphey and Dr. Alan Stein formerly known as Dr. Alan Stone, currently Dr. Dung. To New York. Is it closer to England? It is.
