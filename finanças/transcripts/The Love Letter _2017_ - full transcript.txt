How many times do I have to tell you to pull hard on the charging handle? Damn it! -Okay. Turn around. -[soldiers] Yes, Sergeant. [Sapir] We have a level 2 heat alert today. What does that mean? It means it's gonna be very, very hot today. I want all of you to take out your canteens and drink. [Sapir] Are you okay? [Noa] Fine, I didn't get hurt. You think she did it on purpose? Of course not. [Sapir] Don't be too sure. The girls in this company are a bunch of troublemakers. Good. I wanna see you drink like that even without me saying so. You'll now take a 15-minute break. Fifteen minutes as of now. [soldiers] Yes, Sergeant, 15 minutes! Sit down. Attention, Commander, I am so sorry, I didn't mean... It's okay, lucky for you I didn't get hurt. So you don't want to tell me anything about what you sent me? You mean, the letter? Look, Shimrit. First let me say that things like this can happen in a system like the army. I'm your commander, you're my solider, it's understandable. And secondly I'll say that I'd be happy to hear the whole story from the beginning so we can deal with it in an orderly manner and see how we can take care of this matter. I understand it's embarrassing. Take a moment to compose yourself. I'm sorry.

Then when you go unloading weapons in the morning the girls smell you... Attention, Sergeant. One of the soldiers fainted. [Sapir] Hold this. Stupid soldiers... Move away, please. Get me some water. [Sapir] Get out. Faster, let's go. Shimrit. Can you hear me? Can you hear me, Shimrit? Can you hear me? [Sapir] We're right across from the mess hall. We just don't drink enough here. I said get out. Was I not clear? Can you hear me, Shimrit? [Sapir] You see three tents? One, two, three. You're so beautiful. Noa, I'm here. She wrote me a love letter this morning. For you? Yeah, exactly, I think they're pulling a prank on me. Who? She is. She's pulling a prank on me. -Shimrit? -[Noa] Shh! I can tell when someone's playing to trick me, can't I? Let me read it. -I don't have it on me at the moment. -Come on, I gotta read it. -It's the only way I can tell. -I said, it's not on me. She's a lesbo? I'm not supposed to know things like that. [Sapir] Okay, fine. Sapir, no. Why not? What do you know about her? I said no. She's my solider. A disobedient soldier, Noa, who's making fun of you. Now I have doubts about this whole fainting thing, too. [soldiers] Five seconds! [soldier] Five seconds! -Sapir, you have to go out to them. -How would you spell that? -S-H... -[Noa] Sapir, give me the phone -and go out to them. -Hold on. [soldier] Stand at attention for the sergeant. Two, three... [soldiers] Attention! I don't want them standing there at attention without anyone receiving them, all right? -Then I'll go out to them. -One sec. Check out your soldier. Get up. [Shimrit] Attention, Sergeant. I got permission to rest. Oh, you did, did you? That's wonderful. Such great news. Get up. Get ready and go outside. Move it. [claps] We liked your little show, Shimrit. Me and your commander are very impressed. Go on, faster. Lift those feet. You're late. Ten seconds. Ten seconds as of now. Yes, Sergeant. Ten seconds. [Sapir] You're late. This time, touch the flag, do 10 pushups and get back here in 10 seconds. Ten seconds as of now. Yes, Sergeant. Ten seconds. You're out of time. Get up. I said, get up. You think you can just make fun of my company's commander? Where do you think you are? In kindergarten? Attention, Sergeant. Is it because I'm in love with the commander? Hey, Shimrit! How dare you talk to me like that! Tell her to put her dress uniform on. -[Sapir] Now? -Yes, now. I'm court-martialing this brat. -[Sapir] You? -Yes, me. Can't you hear what I'm saying? [Sapir] You have seven minutes to put on your dress uniform and get back here. Seven minutes as of now. [Shimrit] Yes, Sergeant. Seven minutes. She won't make it in 7. Give her 10. How do you plead? Guilty, not guilty... Article 193 of the military judicial code. Private Shimrit Ben-Naftali, military ID number 7684485. [Shimrit] Yes, Commander. Are you willing to be court-martialed by me? Yes, Commander. [Noa] On August 28th the soldier was impertinent towards her commander, Article 193 of the military judicial code, conduct unbecoming. How do you plead, guilty or not guilty? How do you plead, guilty or not guilty? Attention, Commander. I'm not feeling very well. Did anyone ask you how you're feeling? Stand up straight, feet apart, hands behind your back. Do you plead guilty to writing me a love letter? Yes, Commander. Do you plead guilty to lying in the letter? No, Commander. Do you have a boyfriend? [Shimrit] Yes, Commander. Do you love your boyfriend? Yes, Commander. I don't know what you two want. What do we want? What do we want, Sergeant? We want you to call your boyfriend and tell him you're in love with me. Do it! [cellphone ringing] [man] Babe! Hey. [man] Feeling better, babe? [Shimrit] Yes, I'm fine. [man] Are you on break? I wanted... I wanted to tell you that I fell in love with-- [Noa] Hang up! Hang up! No weekend leave for you. Now get out. What? -Wow, looks like-- -I don't want to hear it. You get out, too. I'll let you have your weekend leave if you tell me why you fell in love with me. Do you want to stay here for the weekend? [Shimrit] No, Commander. Good. Then why not fall in love with your sergeant? Or your other commanders? Huh? You think I need you? I really don't need you or that stupid letter of yours. You know what, Commander? It really was a joke. Sorry. -[soldier] Thirty seconds! -[soldiers] Thirty seconds! -[soldier] Fifteen seconds! -[soldiers] Fifteen seconds! -[soldier] Ten seconds! -[soldiers] Ten seconds! [Sapir] Formation? Yes. [Sapir] Shimrit, get up. Move it, move it. Squad, stand at attention for your commander. Two, three, attention! "A love letter to my commander. My commander is a wildcat. Her body rises like waves in the tide, when she comes towards me at the morning formation... I'm completely tongue-tied. Her eyes are brown and show no fear, but even at night I can see bright and clear, that she roams worlds that are foreign to her, that she needs the wildness, the forest, to dare! If you'd only see me, you'd probably see, the wild unbridled field that I wish to be, with no rules and no boundaries that you need to adapt, because in my world you cannot domesticate a cat! I love you. Shimrit." Have a good day. [soldiers] Have a good day, Commander. [sobbing]
