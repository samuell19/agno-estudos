With the support of Presents PENICILLIN SOLD OUT Janka is very ill. We need penicillin. Hello? Hello! THE GAME Almost there. Entering the border zone now. You'll be drinking coffee in Vienna in the morning. We're almost there. She's asleep. Mihály, how can you stay so calm? I believe in what I do. What's he doing? Following us? - Let's turn back! - Yes, turn back! We can't go back from here. What do we do? We get out. State Security. You're under arrest for illegal border crossing. Mihály… Mihály… you're one of them? You're an artist, a national treasure. Your country needs you. Shame on you! What kind of a person are you? Give her to me! Give her back! Give her back! Give her back! Khrushchev wants to end nuclear tests, and he's written to Kennedy about this. We'll be such good friends with the Yanks, that our work won't be needed. What do you think? I've had it adjusted. I like it. The communist heroes of the Spanish Civil War. Is that Markó? Yes. He's still alive? And he's in Pravda. What does that mean? Nothing good. I serve the working class! Major Éva Gáti. On the occasion of Armed Forces Day, I promote you to lieutenant colonel. Congratulations. I serve the working class! Lieutenant colonel Emil Kulcsár. On the occasion of Armed Forces Day, I promote you to colonel. I serve the working class! Lieutenant colonel András Jung. On the occasion of Armed Forces Day, I promote you to colonel. Congratulations. I serve the working class! …And that 13-year old Czech kid, Slansky's son, says to the judge, “My father is an imperialist spy; he must die.” He demanded the death penalty for his own father! How brave is that? That kid had more faith than all of us together. - Aren't you drinking? - Not now. - Are you...? - Oh, no, definitely not. - Are you planning to have one? - Of course. Alright, then. Let's drink to our health and to your promotions! And who'll promote you, Comrade General? - It's already happened. - So, it's true? You are going to Moscow? I always say, no one's more gossipy than spies… And who's going to replace you? I'll let you know on Revolution Day. Can we talk? Don't you ever rest? Markó. What about him? He's in Pravda. As a communist hero. You know what this means? Tomorrow morning, my office. Why yours? Mine has a better view. And I have better coffee. How about my office? Great. You're very popular. Are you jealous? Don't you ever think about it? With one of them? They're so keen. You used to go to church, right? As a child. You remember the prayer. About “sins in thought, word, deed, or omission.” I never understood how sin can come from thoughts. Thought invites desire. Desire invites action. So no, I do not think about it. Come, let's have a cigarette. I'm tired. Come out to the terrace. I'm sick of not being able to talk freely in my own home… We can talk out here. So, what do you think? The General. He transfers to the KGB. And then I'll take his place. That bastard Kulcsár, he'll undercut you all the time. He's alone, but there are two of us. I'm also sick of playing games. I just want to take three months off. Maybe I'd never come back. I know. Do we really want this? I've been working for this all my life. Pál Markó. The dead has risen. And if Markó is in Pravda... then Moscow has plans with him. - When did Markó fall? - Christmas, 1957. When he helped you, breaking the rules. Without that mistake, he'd be the boss by now. He was a great mind. And after that? Well, he was fired from here. Because you had him fired. No, you had him fired. After he had himself fired, we watched him for a while. He was expelled from the Party. His phone, his car, all his privileges were withdrawn. His wife, Janka, caught the Asian flu and died. Then Markó had a stroke. For days, he was between life and death. - But he recovered. - But if he had such a serious stroke... half of his body was paralysed… he was hardly able to speak... then what does Moscow want from him? But it's only you who say they want something from him. There's a leftist movement going on there. Markó's old Stalinist friends are getting stronger. And if Khrushchev is getting weaker, so is he. You know what'll happen if he comes back. He'll take revenge on me, you, and you. Perhaps he can't even remember, or... think properly. A toothless lion is still a lion. - What do we do? - Surveillance, every day of the week. Sooner or later, we'll see what he's up to. OK. I'll get on to it. No. Internal security. It's my competence. Because of the Moscow connection, it's my competence. I found it. I'll see it through. Shall we ask General Békefi? Listen to me, Emil, no one knows Markó better than I do. That's exactly what I'm afraid of. That you'll feel sorry for him. I didn't feel sorry for him last time either. You put the cassette in here, close the lid, start with this button, and stop with this one... and open it again. Here, try it. My hands are failing me. - Shall I help? - I'll do it, thank you. I managed. I'll take it. Come in. Sit down. Thank you. I came to say I'm sorry. It doesn't matter. I suppose you regret that you helped me. Can I help you in any way? A telephone? A car? Is there anything you want? A passport. I've applied for it twice. Where would you go? I have to go. One second! Wait. Beef stew. Janka's recipe. I'll bring it back. Come over sometime with Éva. We'll talk. - Sure. - Enjoy the food. What's that? Lunch. He sure knows how to cook. I saw a letter… - addressed to some Abigél. - Markó sends letters to someone... Can't even taste the poison, can you? - Goodbye. - Goodbye. I'll take this. Comrade! Markó's letter? Come with me. “Abigél Monori, Kéthely.” That's it. He walked to Petőfi Street and put it in the postbox. After he left, I broke the postbox open. “Dear Abigél, I have received your letter. My condolences. Your father was an excellent man. Although my health is not great, I feel obliged to help you. The bedroom has been empty since my wife died. So you may live here. I will write my address on the envelope. The university is ten minutes away by tram. Love, Uncle Pali” Éva! Set up an operations apartment! - Come! We have a lot to do. - Let's go. Abigél Monori. Have you found out anything about her, Comrade Sebők? I spoke to the party secretary of the local farmers' cooperative. He said she's a smart girl. She got into university and would've started in September, but… her father died in June, so she stayed with her mother. Now she's shovelling shit on a dairy farm. How do they know Markó? What did her father do? Géza Monori. He too worked in the farmers' cooperative. He was a mechanic. I wonder how smart this girl is. I haven't smelt this stink for a long time. Monori! They're looking for you. Mother, Uncle Pali's colleague. - Good afternoon. I'm Mihály Katona. - Mrs Monori. Good afternoon. Take a seat. Thank you. I'm here because Uncle Pali is a good friend of mine. Do you know that Uncle Pali had a stroke? We haven't seen him since 1944. We hid him here in the barn from the Germans. You hid him? Father told me a lot about Uncle Pali. He would've come himself, but he can't travel. I was coming to the area, so he asked me to bring you this letter. Can I go to Budapest? Immediately, if you like. And you can enrol at university, too. Tell Uncle Pali that we are very grateful, - and also to you for bringing it, but... - But what? - But we need to discuss this. - Then let's discuss it now. WHISPERING Would you leave me here alone? Mother, I have just been accepted at university... You'll go next year. I could learn so much from Uncle Pali... - Take care of yourself. - You too. - Write to me. - I will. Is this Budapest? Yes. It's a big city. You'll see. Is this where Uncle Pali lives? No. This is where I live. Good evening. Good evening. Come in. Do take your coat off. Hello. My wife, Kati. Abigél. Good evening. Come, I've made stuffed cabbage. Your textbooks. Thank you. - Did you also attend Eötvös University? - Call it ELTE. People will know that you're from the countryside. ELTE. Is it a problem if people think I'm from the countryside? Misi is also from the countryside. From Rácegrespuszta. Uncle Pali also brought me to Budapest. He's a really good man. Do you know what Uncle Pali's job was? Policeman. We are also police officers. We'll look after you, look after your mother... and, especially after his stroke... we look after Uncle Pali, too. To make sure he doesn't do anything silly. We're afraid Uncle Pali may harm himself. But if someone were there, and would talk to him a lot... - I'd be happy to talk to him. - Very good. And whatever you talk about, you'll tell us. A little more cake? I should tell you? - Behind his back? - In complete secrecy. You're asking me to be an informer? It's not about that. It's about Uncle Pali's life, you see? Patriotic service. It's our duty to help him. You'll get pocket money. Throughout university. And then, when you've graduated, we'll get you a bloody good job. Hm? So, what do you say? That was easy. She's an ambitious girl. Too easy. She knows what she wants. Or what she doesn't want. I used to be like that. And what doesn't she want? Would you put this down, please? To shovel shit. What do you remember? What don't you remember? Free time? What do you usually do? Where do you go for walks? Who do you meet? Who do you write to? Where would you like to travel? Politics? What do you think about Brezhnev? What do you think about Soviet-Hungarian relations? “Dear Comrade Markó, dear Pál, Please forgive my daughter for travelling to Budapest at once, but we were very pleased about the room you offered. The university term has already started and Abigél has to enrol urgently. Please help her. She's a good girl. She'll do the housework and look after you…” That's good. I like it. “Thank you and all the best, Mrs Terike Monori.” - What do you think of Rushchev? - Khrushchev. Sorry, Uncle Misi. Personal questions? How are you? What do you usually think about? What are your desires? Not a word about me and Kati. Deep water. She'll learn to swim fast. Do you trust her? I have a gut feeling. I'm here. Abigél. Go on. How was your trip? Good. By bus? Yes, by bus. You were small. This tall. You cried. I don't anymore. The bedroom. Take a look. Hello? They've just switched the lights off. Okay, you can go home. Not now. My stomach hurts. I'm sorry, miss, you're too late. The course selection ended two weeks ago. I only moved to Budapest yesterday, I couldn't enrol earlier. You can enrol next year. Her father died. Please. That's the rule. Your lecture started ten minutes ago. "So let us shape our minds" as if we have reached the end. Let us not postpone anything, let us engage in combats with life each day. The greatest fault in life is that it is always unfinished, that something "is being postponed." Seneca also says, desires are never so moderate as to be bounded by what they have obtained. What does this mean? What does the author mean? What do you think? Seneca and the Stoics believe that we must control our desires. Because if our desires control us, we are unable to make rational decisions. - What's your name? - Abigél Monori. So... The Stoics... How do you know such things? From books. Seneca... Let's move on. I'm home. That smells really good. Come on, then. How was university? Very good. We had a philosophy seminar. We learnt about Seneca. A Stoic philosopher. The Stoics are too emotionless for me. But the professor said, they are really emotional, only they learnt how to control their emotions. Come! Each book is a person. You talk to them. You talk to a dead person. Wonderful, isn't it? Would you like me to read to you? I would be happy to. “Take away opinion, and you remove the complaint. Take away “I am hurt,” and you remove the harm. You will find that everything happens justly. Not only in an exact order and destined connection, but also according to justice and merit. Go on in observing this, and whatever you do, do it so so that you remain good, according to the true notion of goodness. Observe this in all your actions.” I've forgotten everything. Foreign languages, codes, tunes. Stroke... a prison. Never mind. But I do remember your father. He was a kind man. - Good night. - Good night. Come in. I like it. Thank you. You're on time. I like that. Aunt Kati? She's at work. Let's continue. So he likes to talk to the dead. What he means is that through books we can talk to our ancestors. Does he go anywhere? He goes swimming. Every day. He also accompanied me to the university. He gave 50 forints to the clerk - so that I could enrol. - 50 forints? Uncle Pali and his heart of gold. - Should I not have accepted it? - You did the right thing. And he said he forgot a lot of things, but he remembers my father, because he was a good man. Don't do that with your hands! Did he say what he forgot? Languages, codes, lyrics. Good job. Really? Next round. Who does he talk to? Who does he write to? Who is he in contact with? That's all for today. I'll see you out. How's university? Good. Did you make new friends? They're immature. Especially the boys. “Do nothing at random, or without a goal. Refer your actions to some social purpose. Soon, you shall be no more; nor shall anything remain, which you now behold; nor shall anything that lives now. As it is the nature of all things to change, to turn, and to corrupt; so that others may spring out of them. How small is one man's time of the infinite duration- for it must vanish into eternity. How small a part of the universal matter? How small of the universal spirit? And how narrow a clod of this Earth do you creep on? Know all this and nothing will appear great, except acting as your nature leads; and bearing contentedly whatever the common nature brings.” The old boy's quite something. How much does he usually swim? 3-4 kilometres. Is that a lot? One more and he'd swim across Lake Balaton. He swims 3-4 kilometres a day? Does he go anywhere else? He doesn't like people. He doesn't like people. What do you two eat? I do the shopping, he cooks it. - Letters? Anything? - He hasn't written to anyone. I'm only a beginner at this, but I don't think Uncle Pali wants to do anything stupid. Never underestimate Uncle Pali. Maps? He looks at maps in his room. But when I go in, he locks them in the drawer. You get the key, and I'll give you something. Come and sit here. It's a camera. Works with microfilm. I thought I'd only have to talk to him. This is a higher level. This is how you activate the camera, this is the viewfinder, You two don't live here, do you? This is an operations apartment, nobody lives here. Your pocket money. Thank you, Uncle Misi. Call me Misi, okay? Thank you, Misi. Is that your real name? Yes. Let me, Uncle Pali. Have you seen my key? No. I can't find it. Uncle Pali, you've been to so many places? Yes. And is there anywhere you'd like to go back to? Biarritz. - Is that the West? - France. Basque Country. Sea? Ocean. I can't go swimming today, I've got a bit of a cold. We're not going swimming. We had our honeymoon in Biarritz. We thought we'd go back one day. 25 years of marriage. Very short. - Uncle Pali! The bathwater is ready. - Coming! Thank you. Abigél! Make some tea! The water's boiling! I'll bring the tea. Good. Very good. These are very good. But their operative value is zero. He could have bought these maps in any shop. Are you starting to pity him? He wants to go to Biarritz. They went there for their honeymoon. He wants to sit on a bench and watch the sun set over the ocean. That's very romantic... - Beautiful, yes. - Abigél! Uncle Pali wanted you to feel sorry for him because you are a romantic type. I don't want to do this anymore. You can't go. I don't know how to do it. I'll help you. Trust me. - Hi. - Hi. What's this? Blood. I had to sleep with her. And what was it like? She wanted to quit. Why didn't you let her? For operational interests. What fucking operational interests? - Markó's got to be watched. - Why does Markó have to be watched? Éva… There's something I haven't told you. Janka. You know that she died, but you don't know how. In 1958, when the Asian flu broke out, Markó swallowed his pride and called the man who had ruined his life. He called me to get penicillin for Janka. And did you? No. I was afraid we'd get into trouble. I didn't know Janka was going to die. Markó is going to take revenge. I know it. I can feel it. András, you're afraid? Of Markó? He's an old, sick man, about to die. Tell me what I should do. Send that little bitch home. And finish the game. András. My real name. It's a little like my village. Look! I was born in this house. So? Do you like it? Is this yours? This is where I want to grow old. And Kati? Is she really your wife? She's called Éva. Don't you feel sorry for her? It's not that simple. She's had too many abortions. We can't have children. I'll give you children. Did Markó say anything about politics? Did he react to Brezhnev or Khrushchev? Perhaps he's not planning anything after all. - But is it true, or did we make it up? - What? That Khrushchev will be replaced. Everyone's talking about it. He'll be replaced by Brezhnev. And is that better? Of course not, neither is good. Marx still believed in something good. So did Lenin. But this lot is only interested in power. A lot of people are disillusioned. Even our party leader. Only he doesn't show it. But then who can we believe in? Nobody. In yourself, your own good. We only have one life and it's fucking short. I'm back. Hello! Would you like some tea? Abigél? I really don't feel like going... and being nice to this little bitch all evening. I don't want to go either. Then why are we going? Don't say it's for operational interests. Take a look at Markó yourself. If you think he's clean, I will end the game and send the girl home. Please come in. Thank you. Old friends of mine: Éva Gáti, András Jung. Abigél Monori. I received a notification that I have a place at university and will get a scholarship as well. Then I wrote a letter to Uncle Pali, to ask if I could live here. He replied that I should come as he has a spare room. Cherry sponge cake. My favourite. I made it. Here you are. And now I've been living here for almost a month. Your turn. Tell me how you are. I've enquired about your passport. Where would you travel? To the ocean. That's where he went on honeymoon with Janka. That must be beautiful. They said you should reapply and I'll see what I can do. No need. It's up to you. What's married life like? We're okay. Like you and Janka used to be. Trust. There's no point otherwise. Children? - None. - None. When András is promoted. - No, no, that's not even certain. - We'll find out next week. I don't even know if I want it. Of course you want it. If you don't want it, you'll get it. Really? If you don't want it, you'll get it. András! Come. What about boys? Who's the lucky one? A country boy. Do I know him? Certainly not this boy. Is it serious? He wants children. Your niece is sweet. Well, then the daughter of your old comrade. Abigél. She's not Abigél. Someone sent her. Don't be ridiculous. You invited her to live with you. She's just said you wrote her a letter. I did, but I never sent it. “Dear Abigél, … unfortunately, my health does not permit you to live here. You wrote this letter? Did you send the girl? - No, of course not. - Look at me. - Éva? - Éva? Why would she have sent her? What is this about? Markó never sent the letter. What? He said that this Abigél is not his Abigél. I don't understand. Honey trap. I knew it. I told you she was too easy to recruit. Someone wanted me to fall in this trap. Someone who wants to stop my appointment. To General Békefi's place. - You can't be serious. - You wanted to quit from the beginning. You wanted me to quit, too. Shame on you! You brought the fake letter, you sent the girl on to me. And you fucked her! Was it you? András. I love you. I'm your wife. And I will not betray this alliance for myself, or the firm, or the Party. Only you can ruin this. Trust me! Then you must trust me too. Did you tell the girl anything that could compromise you? No. - Not even when you were fucking? - No. The fake letter came from Sebők. Sebők? - Who's behind him? - We don't know. But if you didn't say anything, they can't hurt you. Us. Get in. But András, I've got an exam. This is important. Where are we going? To your country house? - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. It's ready. Please send it to this address. I'll pay for it. Was your job to seduce me? - But meanwhile... - Yes, or no? Yes. Are you a spy? Yes. Who do you work for? I've just graduated from Dzerzhinsky. You work for us. - You are my first job. - Who commissioned you? Comrade Kulcsár. The dirty rat. He said it's a top-secret mission that only he and I can know about. So this is Kulcsár's private operation to take me out and take my place. And your mother? Is she a colleague too? I saw her for the first time that day. And you believe you're not good enough to be a spy. Mata Hari is bullshit compared to you. How often did you report to Kulcsár? Weekly. Did you visit him too? What did you tell him? For a while, everything, but then I fell in love with you. Was the blood real? Did you tell him that you had slept with me? But I didn't tell him that I wanted it too. He hid a recorder in my handbag, and told me to tape our next meeting. - You recorded what we talked about? - But I didn't give it to him. - Where is the tape? - In my bag. Take it out. It's not in it. Markó. And Kati? Is she really your wife? She's called Éva. Don't you feel sorry for her? It's not that simple. She's had too many abortions. We can't have children. I'll give you children. Did Markó say anything about politics? Did he react to Brezhnev or Khrushchev? Perhaps he's not planning anything after all. What do you want? Money? Power? Do you want to come back to the firm? Do you want to go to Moscow? What do you want? Penicillin. He's got a pulse. It was an accident. He fell. You came home from university. You noticed... and called the ambulance. - I'll go down to make the call. - Not yet. Give me the recorder. A blank tape. Read this. - “So, what now?” - “Nothing, the game is over. We close the Markó file.” “And what about us?” “Get on a bus and go home to your mother. It's all over between us.” Give this to Kulcsár. Kulcsár. Kulcsár? Behind the General's back? I also thought he was much more cowardly. - He wanted to blackmail you, right? - He did, the rat. He wants to sit in Békefi's seat. And that little bitch told you all this? I scared her. She wants a position. I don't want a colleague like that. We'll get her transferred. I shouldn't have slept with her. We once told each other “forever”. This has to fit in “forever”. András! - Yes? - Markó fell. He's been taken to hospital. Will he survive? I don't know. Come into my office. We'll call the doctor. The Central Hospital, comrade. Terike, where did this box come from? It came in the post this morning. There's no sender on it. Should I ask the technicians to open it? No, thank you, I will. Wish him a speedy recovery. What shall we do with Markó? What shall we do? Good question. IF YOU DON'T WANT IT, YOU'LL GET IT. We haven't found a fucking thing for weeks. Let's close it. Let's. Yes? Comrade General wants to see you immediately. Coming. Hello. Sit down. Hello. Sit down. - Hello. - Hello. Thank you. - Hello. - Hello. Good afternoon. Sit down. Before the appointment, the Moscow comrades asked me to test my successor, Comrade Jung. I instructed Comrade Kulcsár to conduct a complex operative game to put Comrade Jung's loyalty to the test. We've been playing this game for the past four weeks. Comrade Kulcsár. The game began with a forged Pravda, which our agent put into Comrade Jung's letterbox. A fake article directed Comrade Jung's attention towards his old master Pál Markó. So, we wrapped our own game in a game against Markó. We had been watching Markó for a while. In his apartment, we found an unsent letter… that he'd written to the daughter of his old friend, a certain Abigél Monori. We wrote another one instead. And replaced the original Abigél with our own agent. Abigél Monori? I got it. We lured Comrade Jung to the countryside, where our honey trap was set for him. Lieutenant Magdolna Földi. An excellent student from the intelligence academy. She had to act as Markó's acquaintance and earn Comerade Jung's trust. It was a double game. A game within a game. Comrade Földi had to play her role perfectly. Because, if Markó became suspicious, Jung would become suspicious too. During the game, the comrades had sexual intercourse... … on one occasion - for operational interests. Comrade Földi recorded their last encounter on tape. “The game is over. We close the Markó file.” Give this to Kulcsár. According to this tape and the reports, Comrade Jung did not compromise himself during the entire game. The honey trap also proved ineffective as he remained emotionally unaffected. He remained loyal to his marriage, the firm, and the Party throughout. There are no obstacles to his appointment on 7th November. That's exactly what I thought until about twenty minutes ago. Then I nearly had a heart attack. As some evidence reached me. This. Did Markó say anything about politics? Did he react to Brezhnev or Khrushchev? Perhaps he's not planning anything after all. But is it true, or did we make it up? What? That Khrushchev will be replaced. Everyone's talking about it. He'll be replaced by Brezhnev. - And is that better? - Of course not, neither is good. Marx still believed in something good. So did Lenin. But this lot is only interested in power. A lot of people are disillusioned. Even our party leader. Only he doesn't show it. - But then who can we believe in? - Nobody. In yourself, your own good. We only have one life and it's fucking short. It's incredible what sort of people there are. After my appointment, the first thing I'll do is… You're not taking my place. Not me? Then who? Let me go. I'll go on my own. Hello. Hello. Thank you. I would like to repay you in some way. What do you need? A passport. I'm afraid that's impossible. Comrade Markó is a national treasure, your country needs you. Anything else? Do you want a rest? I could do with a rest as well. I'll get you a referral. Thank you. - Bye. - Bye. Comrade Markó? - Good afternoon. - Come with me. - This is your bed. - Yes. I'll look around. - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. - Yes? - He left the sanatorium during the night. Markó? Comrade Major-General? If I had a hundred thousand forints, I'd buy a car. You? Beer. - How much is a beer? - Two-fifty. Jung? Car or beer? I already had a car and a flat, so... Magda! … so beer.
