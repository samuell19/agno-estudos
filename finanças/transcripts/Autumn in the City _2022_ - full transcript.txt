Without six roommates and a bed that folds into the wall. But honey, that apartment belongs to a stranger you met on the internet. She's not a stranger. We talked about this. My friend Abbie posted that her friend Amelia was looking for someone to sublet. I met her over Zoom and she seems very nice. And what if something goes wrong? What if a pipe bursts? Besides, Amelia left me an entire checklist for the apartment in case anything goes wrong. We just don't understand why you had to leave Omaha and move halfway across the country. Because it's time that I get out on my own. What about work? A steady job and a steady career. I have an appointment about that very thing this afternoon. So, I gotta go. We love you. Just call us, alright? Just keep us posted, ok? I love you, sweetheart. Love you too. Gotta go, bye. Oh. Well, I have got to go. My 1:00 is starting. It's 1:30 Mom, and who's counting? Austin. Wonderful to see you. Hi. We are both gonna have the Kale Caesar. I was gonna get the chicken sandwich. Nonsense. It is my favorite salad in the city. So, what's the occasion? You know it's not my birthday, right? The Paley Center is hosting a retrospective to celebrate my 40 years in the news business. And I want to inspire the next generation of journalists. I'll add it to my calendar. Well, I want you to do more than that. They're honoring my legacy, which includes you as well and so naturally there will be some questions about your current, um... Career status. I have arranged an interview for you at the New York Chronicle. Mom, no, we've been over this countless times. It's not what I want for myself. I'm making my own way. By doing what? Tutoring? It's a means to an end. I saved up enough money so I can focus on writing. Children's fairy tales. Books, Mom. I want to write exciting and adventurous books for a young audience. Isn't that inspiring the next generation too? Honey, you have so much potential. You are smart. You have a degree in journalism from Northwestern. Did you even read the pages I sent you? Oh, wow. That looks absolutely marvelous. They're just salads, Mom. And it is just a meeting, Austin. The editor is an old friend of mine. He's... he's expecting you. If I do this interview, will you promise to drop it? Yes. Fine. I'll do it, but I'm not gonna like it. Just like this salad. So what are your job goals? I came here to figure out what I want to do with my life. Well that is about as honest an answer as I've ever heard. Let's start with your work history. Um, for the past seven years I've worked for my dad's patio furniture company back home. And why did you quit? I realized I'm about to turn 30 and I was living the life that my parents wanted for me, but not the life that I wanted for myself and I knew that if I stayed I would never get up the courage to get out on my own. So, I quit my job and I gave up my apartment and I moved to New York City. That's gutsy. I'm sure we can find work for you pretty quickly. I know you see a lot of people who are just looking for temp jobs but I really want more than that. - Mmmhmm. - I figure temping is my best shot at trying out a lot of different careers. And you're at the center at the job market. I want to work with you to find my calling. Well, that's a first. I would love to work with you. Any particular field you'd like to start with? I am flexible. I mean, New York is full of possibilities, right? Alright. Well, let's see what we've got. We just got an opening this afternoon for a fashion show. Great. Sign me up. Ok. This is Isabella Demark's most important fashion show of the year. You are to be seen and not heard, is that understood? Understood. Oh, seen, not heard. Right, right. Um, I do have one question. When do we get to see the collection? None of you are to go anywhere near the runway, the models or the couture. I'm just curious, you know, are we talking like classic staples or is it more like futuristic and impractical pieces? I mean, that would be my vote. You hand out press passes. You set up chairs. You, pick up the order from Juice Boost. Um, what's that? A micro metrics raw juice bar. Downtown on Great Jones Street. Here is the address and the orders. I need these exact and I need them by 3:00PM. Don't be late. Uh, right. I was thinking I... Is there a problem? No. No, I am... I am just grateful to be here. You should be. 3:00PM. I won't be late. Actually, I will be early. Do you know the best way to get... Austin, Alan Sandler. Thanks so much for waiting. Busy day here? News never stops, does it? Which is why I don't want to take up too much of your time. My thoughts exactly. We're thrilled that you're joining the team. Joining the team? We'll start you on features first thing tomorrow morning. I thought this was an interview. This is you. When Patricia calls and tells us to give her son a job, we listen. Must be a big relief. I wish I had those kinds of connections when I was coming up. Don't you want to see if I'm the right fit? If you're anything like your mother, you're gonna fit right in. Taxi! Taxi. - Hey, that's my cab! - It's my taxi. Glad to know chivalry is alive and well! Taxi! Taxi! I know I'm late but this jerk stole my cab and proved that chivalry is dead. Gone, caput. Did you know where I'm supposed to put these? And you are not a person. Oh... I can... I can... I can clean this. Um, does anybody have any club soda? Or uh... or um... Nathan the Squirrel stood atop the pinnacle of the Empire State Building, with his little pair of flying shoes. But, the only thing he wanted was to come back safely to the ground. Ok, that's how you want to play it, huh? Ok. Ok. Let's see... Radiator. "Turn valve all the way to the left." Check. "Kick twice for good luck." Ok. Ha, ha! Victory is mine. "And one last thing," "if the guy across the hall is looking for me, tell him..." Oh. You're not Amelia. Wait, you're the guy who stole my taxi. What? That wasn't your taxi. I flagged it. Yeah, for me. I assumed you were being nice. Well you're clearly not from New York. I just moved here. I'm subletting for Amelia for the next two months. Two months? Where'd she go? Uh, work trip in Japan and then traveling. I'm sure you'll see it all over her feed. Wait a minute. 9:00PM, a bottle of wine? I know what this is. And I'm gonna go back across the hall to my apartment now. Mmhm. Goodnight! You again? Oh, you're the guy across the hall. - Amelia left a message for you. - She did? Uh, "Dear Austin," is that you? One and the same. "I think you're great and we always have fun together" "but I think it's time we move on." Oh, I think she's breaking up with you. Yeah, thanks for making that clear but we weren't actually dating. "I know we weren't actually dating." Well, at least you two were on the same page about something. "And that's the problem, "I'm ready for a relationship but not with you. "I need someone who's more serious" "about their direction..." You don't have to keep reading. But I've never broken up with somebody on behalf of somebody else before. You having fun? A little. I'm sorry, who are you exactly and why are you here? I'm Piper and I came here to figure out my calling and make something of myself. Why are you laughing? That's cute. No, no reason. I just didn't know people actually used phrases like that. I'm sure it'll all work out for you. It will. Thank you. - Good night. - Good night! Ok. Ok, so this is really bugging me so I have to ask. What's your master plan for the two months you're here? I signed up with a temp agency. That's your plan? Yeah, I had my first job today. And how'd it go? Hm, fashion isn't really my thing. Let me see if I got this right. You gave yourself two months to find your passion and then make it but you don't even know what field that'll be in and the first job you tried fired you? I didn't say fired. You didn't have to. You seem like a nice, if slightly deluded person so I'm just gonna tell you straight up. Success isn't all it's cracked up to be. Hm. New Yorkers really are opinionated. It's not an opinion, it's a fact. I've seen the inner circle. That must be nice. But, for the rest of us, we have to take what we can get. So, thank you. For what? The wine. You're welcome. Pumpkin bread? Enjoy it. Would you like to try some seasonal pumpkin bread? Oh, uh, sure. Thank you. This is really good. Have you tried this pumpkin bread? Maybe she's more of an apple crumble person. Did you make this? No, that would be my husband, Toby. You should come in and meet him. Your efforts have certainly earned you a coffee on the house. Wow, ok. Follow me. So, what lucky gust of wind dropped you on our doorstep like Marlo Thomas in "That Girl" 'cause you are clearly not from around here? Don't let Will fool you. He tumbled out of a Greyhound bus too and never looked back. Where from? A part of Wisconsin you've never heard of and never will. He's put that part of his life behind him. I simply reinvented myself. It's a great thing about this city, you can just start over. And become the person you were meant to be. That's exactly why I'm here. To figure out who I'm meant to be. I'm Piper and you two are officially my new favorite people. You must be Toby. I love the pumpkin bread. Welcome to the Keystone Café. Yeah, we actually opened the café as a refuge for anyone new to the city. We know what it's like to move here on your own. Usually with parents back home who don't understand and don't approve. Am I wearing a sign or something? How did you know? Oh, just one of my many mysterious gifts. Coming up, my special pumpkin spice latte. Why don't you go take a seat and I'll bring it right over. Thanks. Austin, what a surprise. I could say the same thing. A job offer at the New York Chronicle really? Some interview. Well, I knew you wouldn't go otherwise. I am interviewing the secretary of the UN. You could be doing important work like that too. Fictional stories provide an escape. Entertainment. Inspiration. That can be just as important a public service as journalism. I'm not taking the job, Mom. Ah, do we have an artist in our midst? No. It's just a silly hobby. Coffee, Toby, black. Furthest reaches of the galaxy black. You saw your mother, I take it? Need a shot of whiskey instead? Don't get my hopes up. I know you don't have a liquor license. What's this? First, you move in across the hall and now you move in on my favorite café? Oh, I must have missed your name on the door. Wait, you two know each other? Yeah, we're temporary neighbors. Wait, how are you both so buddy-buddy. It took months for Will and Toby to warm up to me. That's because you're always giving off total curmudgeon vibes. I doubt curmudgeon is the right word. Holed up writing your book all day. A grunt of acknowledgement when I call your order. You're a writer? Working on it. But as of an hour ago, I'm apparently a journalist. My mother got the New York Chronicle to offer me a job. Your mother must be very important. His mother is Patricia Edwards. Your mother is Patricia Edwards? As in the famous journalist? I mean, she's kind of a legend. Yeah, I guess she is. Well, you're not gonna take the job, are you? What if I did? But you always fought to carve your own path? I can't keep hoping she'll come around to that. Maybe it's time for a new strategy. Austin. Go with me here. I could do the bare minimum and cash a good paycheck. All while secretly working on my book. Wait a minute, so you plan on taking a good job with the intent to do a bad job? Yep. I think you might regret that. And how is your job hunt going? Have you found your passion and made it yet? Not yet, but I will rub it in your face when I do. She actually has a new job at the Uptown Museum in New York. Austin, why don't you show her how to get to the right subway? Good idea. She'd undoubtedly get lost otherwise. There's nothing wrong with getting lost along the way. That's how you stumble upon the best things. In a hurry? No, why? How can you appreciate everything around you when you rush right by it? What's there to see? Oh! Who has the cutest little sweater, huh? And the floppies little ears, huh? Yeah? Don't you have some place to be? Yes, but I can take in all the beautiful sights of the city on the way. Like, look at these leaves. Marvelous color. Doesn't it make you just want to curl up in a cozy flannel? No, makes me want to tell the residents to sweep their sidewalks. Does New York really hold no magic for you? In the fantasy of my mind and the stories I write. Not in real life. So then why do you live here? Because New York's the greatest city in the world. I thought you just said... I'm a New Yorker. I'm supposed to hate everything. Yeah, when you're ready to go to work, the subway's just straight up that way. Unless of course you get distracted romanticizing a sewer grate. You never know what wonders lie beneath our feet. Have a good day! You too. As an attendant, you'll have to answer any visitor questions and provide directions. So, please familiarize yourself with the layout. Must be so exciting working here. Surrounded by all this, you know, history and culture. Indeed. We don't allow food, drinks and definitely no touching the collection. Hopefully you won't be confronted with too many field trips of rowdy school children. Well, if I have to defend myself at least I know where the ancient battle shields are. That was a joke. Funny. Let's get you a name tag. Great. Not a fan of museums? Huh? Well, I just... I noticed you glued to your phone. There's nothing here that's piquing your interest? No, my mom made us come. Most boring vacation ever. Where would you rather have gone? Hawaii, to surf. Surfing, that's fun. But aren't you afraid of sharks? No, I love them. They're so awesome. Oh. Well then you should check out our third floor because we have a huge shark exhibit. Are there hammerheads? Uh-huh. What about great whites? Oh yeah. Definitely. I'm sorry, is my son bothering you? Mom! She said there's a shark exhibit. We have to go. Thank you. I was beginning to lose hope. I practically had to drag him here. My pleasure. Uh, you can take the elevators on the left. Third floor. Can't miss it. Austin, let's hit the ground running. We're doing a piece on the founder of a new tech startup. Why don't you take the lead on this? It's not really my scene. It's not really how things work. Ok. I'll get it to you by the end of the week. More like tomorrow, Austin. News moves fast. But you're your mother's son, you can handle it, right? Sure. I'm gonna need a bit more enthusiasm than that around here. Piper! You've received excellent remarks on the visitor cards left behind. That's so nice. Does it correspond to any kind of perks? Because I have had my eye on Cleopatra's bracelet. No perks, but it does come with an offer. The department is looking for a new visitor relations supervisor. I'd like to recommend you for the job. Oh. It's a full-time position. Not one that opens up here too often. Are you interested? You turned the job down? Why? I don't know, it just... Wasn't the right fit? Exactly. Any idea what the right fit might be? It's a gut feeling. I'll know it when I see it. Ok, Piper. But you told me that you only have two months. At some point, you're going to have to figure out what it is that you want. - After you. - After you. Go frolic in the leaf piles before I kick them out of the way. Pantheon Publicity, please hold. Pantheon Publicity, please hold. Pantheon Publicity, please hold. Pantheon Publicity, please hold. Pantheon Publicity, please hold. Try again, Austin. My desk, two hours. Wow! This is pretty great. Are none of my spots sacred? Why so grumpy? Let me guess, your master plan isn't working out how you hoped? Not exactly. How about yours? Hm. May have told the temp agency to throw everything they got at me. And? And, a hedge fund offered me a full-time admin job today. Let me guess, you turned it down? How did you know that? You did the same thing at the museum. Will told me. One cappuccino in that guy and suddenly he's Lady Whistledown. Doesn't it seem odd that you keep turning down jobs without even giving them a chance? No. Because I'm not looking for just a job. I am looking for a fulfilling career. And when I find it, it's going to feel like a lightning bolt. What's with the deadline anyway? Why don't you give yourself more time? Well, I gave myself until my 30th birthday. Uh-ha, it all makes sense now. You're scared. I am not sacred. Your 20's are in the rearview. The choice you make now will have consequences. Make the wrong one and you could end up stuck for life. Exactly. That's the point. Which is why I gave myself the freedom to try out multiple careers so I can make the right decision. And, in fact, I think you're the one who's scared. Obsessing over every little punctuation in an otherwise finished book. How do you know that? Toby. Those two, I swear. So, why not just send it out? Unless you're scared of succeeding? No. Now who's making baseless accusations? Oh, ok. If they're so baseless then why not just send it? All due respect, you're the last person I'll be taking career advice from. Well, then why don't you take it from your mom? I bet she didn't get where she is by holding back. You have no idea the choices my mom made to get where she is. Well, I know she, at least, made some choices. Good night, Austin. Good night. One pumpkin spice latte, extra cinnamon. Piper! Hm? Oh! Thanks. Question, don't you think that turning 30 is a benchmark? One of those mornings, is it? Well, as a wizened oracle of 44, I'd say age is just a number. But three zero is a number worth celebrating. When's the big day? Uh, in five weeks. Oooh, I'm already planning your party. You don't have to. No, it's too late. It's already in my head. And once the train leaves the station there's no stopping it. How do you feel about funny hats? Uh... I've learned to just go along for the ride. Love them. Getting the big 3-0 jitters? It's just something Austin said on the rooftop the other night. The roof? What roof? Is there a great view and a place to string lights? I think so. That's where we'll do your party. Carry on. He basically said that my fear of making the wrong choice is holding me back from finding my path. You think there's any truth to that? Maybe. I wasn't always a baker, you know. It's true. I fell in love with a corporate attorney who risked it all for what he really wanted. - Me. - Pumpkin bread. Finding your dream, the thing that makes you want to jump out of bed each day, you'll know it when you find it. What if I don't? Don't lose hope just yet. Thanks for the pep talk. So what wild temp job are you headed off to now? Actually, it's an interview to be a dinner hostess. I figured I could bank some extra cash in between the temp jobs. It's not like I can make a career out of drawing in my apartment at night. - Good luck. - Thanks. See ya later! This must be a very popular restaurant. Doesn't look like a restaurant but maybe they're having some interviews. Hi. Hey, Alan. I forgot to mention I've got a dentist appointment today. Gotta lay off the candy in the break room, so I'm gonna be a day late with my article. I hope you understand. - Piper Grant? - Oh, yep! We're ready for you. Ok. Thanks. You can leave your headshot and resumé on the table, please. Oh, I just have a resumé. I don't have a headshot. Of course not. Did you prepare the sides? Uh, sides? Like, curly fries? Isn't... isn't that the chef's job? Oh, is this one of those performance restaurants like Medieval Times or Ed Debevic's? Like... No, honey. We're casting for a Broadway musical. Oh, Broadway. Like, Broadway, Broadway. Can you sing us something? Oh, um, I, I don't... You know, there is one song I know... ♪ Give my regards to Broadway ♪ ♪ Remember me from Herald Square ♪ Just setting you all up for success. You're welcome. It's well-written and very interesting. A squirrel finds an oak tree who's acorns grant wishes. Charming concept. There's so much potential here. I wanted more. That's so great to hear, Susan. No, I mean I wanted more story. I don't follow. One-off books are hard to sell. It's all about series nowadays. I guess I never considered that. I'd like you to come back in a couple of weeks. Pitch your vision for a larger series. Then I can assess whether it might be a good fit for us. A couple weeks? Yeah, yeah I can... I can do that. Ok. I'll, uh, we'll talk. My assistant said the restaurant couldn't fit a table for 20. It's my opening night, for goodness sake. You know the place that has the wallpaper with the birds and the dessert with the rose petals. What's it called... Constellation. And that rose petal pie is incredible. I'll call you back. I could probably get you a table if you wanted. I lugged apples around for them last week and I made friends with the chef. If only my last two assistants were as resourceful. Are, are you looking for an assistant? That depends. Are you an actress? Uh, recent experience proves no. Definitely, definitely, not. Do you have any references? Oh, never mind, my previous two girls had great references and look where that got us. This is a full-time job. Are you up to the task? A full-time job is exactly what I'm looking for. You're hired. For a trial period. You start tomorrow. Great. So, does it come with health benefits or... Don't be late. Great! Water. Oh. Don't want you to smudge your lipstick. Thank you. "Miss Chilton's performance shone like a sparkling diamond" "in a career full of gems." From the top. Uh, "Miss Chilton's performance shone like a sparkling diamond" "in a career full of gems." Again. But I just read it twice. Oh, you think I'm being silly, don't you? Well, maybe you're right, but I worked hard to get to where I am and so when someone acknowledges my skill, I listen. And I listen well. These moments, they don't come along every day. Once again, from the top. "Miss Chilton's performance, it shone like a sparkling diamond..." When can you get me and Tobes tickets to her new show? Ugh. Come on, it's the whole point of having famous friends. Yeah, well I'm not the famous one. But, it is pretty exciting. That's because you're famous by association. Ryan Gosling once ordered a cold brew at the café and I'm basically a D-list celeb now. Maybe something in theatre is what I'm meant to do. Now I really wish we had a liquor license so I could pour you a celebratory drink. Not so fast. I haven't even pitched for this series yet. Details. Have you told Piper the good news? No. Last we spoke we got into an- Argument. And we haven't spoken since. Well you should tell him about your new job. If anything, he'll be happy you took his advice. And give him the satisfaction? I would rather- Not. I'd never hear the end of it. You know how she can be. Always so confident she has all the right moves. Uh-huh. Hey, do you want to picnic tomorrow in Central Park? - I'd love to. - Great. Austin? What are you doing here? What are you doing here? I'm meeting Will for lunch. I'm having lunch with Toby. They weren't planning for the four of us... "Hey guys, sorry, can't make it. "Busy at the café." "Have fun without us." He could have at least tried to make that sound convincing. Austin and Piper? Toby sends you both the harvest lunch. Um, thank you? Thanks. We don't have to do this. Nope, we do not. There is a lot of cheese. - What about charcuterie? - Yep. Oh! Fig jam. It would be a chance at a new experience. It is always nice here in autumn. I'm sorry, did you just compliment the city? What has gotten into you? You never mentioned you draw. You never asked. Can I see? These are seriously great. You ever consider pursuing art as your dream? No, absolutely not. It's just something I do for fun. You ever wanted to make something more of it? My parents scrimped and saved to send me to college and in return, the expectation was that I would take over the family business or at least secure a practical job in a practical career. But art is a career. Growing up, if a career wasn't stable then it wasn't a legitimate career. Choosing something creative was throwing your life away. You know, there's good sense in that. Art is fun but it's really difficult to make a living drawing sketches. Well, you're very talented. I call dibs on all the stinky cheese. Listen, I feel like I owe you an apology. I'm sorry for the way I acted last week. No, I... You were right. I was jumping from job to job. No, you were just testing out the waters. I just hadn't found anything that felt right. And I didn't want to waste any more time. I mean, everyone my age already had their life figured out and I'm just at the starting line. What's that advice about everyone running their own race at their own pace? Not the advice you want to hear when you're on a four-week deadline. But, I did actually accept a full-time job as an assistant to a famous Broadway actress. Wow. That's great. Piper, I'm so happy for you. Thanks. And I owe you an apology too. I shouldn't have butted in on your writing. No, I'm glad you did. I took your advice and reached out to a publisher. She wants to hear my pitch for the book as a series in a couple weeks. That's incredible. I owe it all to you. So what is this book about? Well, it's about a squirrel named Nathan who finds an oak tree with magical acorns that grant wishes. His first wish is to become a movie star. Then, to bat a home run at the world series and then to become the first squirrel to walk on the moon. He doesn't have friends so his wishes wind up being a way he keeps himself company. Am I boring you? No, no, no. No. I'm listening. Keep going. So, for the series, I was thinking that maybe another animal finds the oak tree too. A blue jay. The squirrel and the blue jay are initially rivals but then they eventually become best friends and go on adventures together. But I can see it's not as engaging as I had hoped. Maybe it needs a new direction. No. I think... I think the direction is perfect. Kind of like this? Wow. This is even better than I imagined. I always pictured it in the summer but it's better in the fall. It's beautiful. What? Nothing, I just- It's my mother. I'll call her back. No, answer it. It's your mom. Hi, Mom. Austin, swing by for dinner on Friday. I want to hear how your job is going. Alright, see ya then. Dinner with your mom. That sounds fun. The evening's menu will include catering from my mother's favorite restaurant and parental disappointment. I'm sure it's not gonna be that bad. Why don't you come and see for yourself? No, no. Come on. You're the one who's always talking about trying new experiences. Yeah, like a picnic in Central Park. Not dinner at a famous broadcast journalist's home. It'll be a chance to see New York success up close and personal. Dine with the hoi polloi in Brooklyn Heights. Come on, at the very least it'll be a free meal and a chance to see what a famous person's bathroom looks like. Well, when you put it that way. Austin. This is the third time in as many weeks that you're late. I'm not really much of a morning person. I'm not talking about when you get here, although you are usually late. Your last few assignments have been turned in past deadline which puts a squeeze on copy edit. I shouldn't even have to explain this to you. Ok. Faster turnarounds, you got it. Even when it's on time, your work is below what you're capable of. It's clear your heart's not in this. I have to let you go. Ha, ha, ha, ha. La, la, la, la... La... La, la, la, la, la, la... Just answer it! Sorry. Hello? Hi, Piper. It's Barbara. We have a new job listing, it starts tomorrow. Hi, Barbara. I actually took a full-time position. Oh. Well, that's great. I know how important it was for you to find a job that was a good fit. La, la, la, la... Well it looks like you finally found your calling. Yes. Yes, I have. I really appreciate all your hard work. Thank you so much. La, la, la, la... Sorry about that. It's fine. You'll need to get your affairs in order anyway before we go on tour. Uh, on tour? Yes. My agent called yesterday with an offer I couldn't refuse. Playing Maria in the Sound of Music. Like a tour outside of New York? That is generally what happens when you go on tour. And how long would that be? Three months. But then, it's off to the West End in London for the run of the new Andrew Lloyd Webber. That is a fantastic opportunity. You know, see the country, travel abroad... Why do I get the feeling you're trying to convince yourself? No, no that is... that is not it. I thought the world of theatre was what you wanted? I guess I just hadn't really considered all of the details. Well, I couldn't forgive myself if I stood in the way of you becoming the person that you were meant to be. What does that mean? I need someone by my side who's lifeblood is the theatre. It's just not you. I'm sorry, Piper. I'm going to have to let you go. But... but, what? Oh, don't look so sad. Think of this as your fantastic opportunity. A chance for you to discover your true calling. Yes, yes, it is. Yes. La, la, la, la, la, la... It seems like we both got kicked to the curb today. Not our finest hour. I haven't got a foothold in anywhere. I have less than a month left in my sublet and I feel like I'm back at square one. Why didn't you want to go on tour with Misty? I guess it was a great opportunity but all of my instincts were telling me it was the wrong choice. Hm, my dad. Don't want to answer? And let him know that I was fired? I'd would never hear the end of it. Sometimes I feel like my parents care a little too much. I wouldn't have minded that kind of attention growing up here. What was that like? You never mentioned your dad. My dad and I haven't had much of a relationship since the divorce. Another consequence of the successful life. So, what happened? My dad was a segment producer and my mom was just a junior anchor. Network wanted to give her, her own hour but they didn't want my dad involved. She took the job and that became a running theme in my life. Her choosing work over everything else. I'm sorry you went through that. So, we won't be telling my mom I got fired either. Deal. When I covered the '92 Olympics, Christie said to me "I have faced an audience of millions of people "waiting for me to fall, but nothing compared" "to facing an interview with you." Imagine that? A gold medalist and she was nervous to sit down with me. You have had such amazing experiences. I have and preparing for this retrospective has been quite the jaunt down memory lane. But I feel like I've been doing the talking all evening. Maybe because you have. Oh, honey. You know I read your piece on the piano teacher in Brooklyn. It was good. I thought it could maybe use a little more, um, pizazz maybe? Well, I Is that the paper? I better take this. Excuse me. It's a relief seeing him marching forward with his life. Now if only I could figure out what to do with my life. I feel like I'm just bobbing along kind of directionless. You know, I have something for you to see. Come with me. This is what I wanted to show you. This is the pen that I used to write my first article. The one that kicked off my career. Now, this is back in the day of carbon paper and fax machines. What's a fax machine? It was a joke. You have a sparkle, Piper. And you know this city will try its best to dull that, so, don't let it. You know, my family wasn't very thrilled that I left our little town in Ohio. And they figured that I would fail and come running home with my tail between my legs. But once they saw my first article in print, they saw something tangible and they started to understand. My family is the exact same way. They think that I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know. Maybe, maybe they're right. Maybe I'm crazy for chasing after a dream that I don't even know what it is yet. How did you figure out that journalism was your passion? I took it as an elective in college. And from my very first lecture, I was hooked. I'm starting to think I'm never gonna have that feeling. Trust in yourself, Piper. Nothing is more important for a woman in this world. Especially for a woman looking to find her way. It can be hard to resist the pressures of what other people want for us. But we must double down on ourselves and never expect others to hand us what we want. So, remember one thing. Always, always be your own champion. Thank you for dinner, Mom. Top-notch selection as always. They're going to be holding the retrospective at the restaurant. Piper, you must come. That would be great and thank you again for the wonderful dinner. I really love this painting, by the way. The texture and composition really balance the vivid hues. Most people just say "pretty colors." Well, I'm friends with the gallery owner. Piper's a wonderful artist herself. I... I just doodle sometimes, that's all. Maybe you should introduce her to your friend. He might know of an open position. I don't... I don't want to impose. Well, I'd be happy to. I would really appreciate that. Thank you. My pleasure. It was lovely meeting you. So lovely meeting you. Thank you for dinner, Mom. - Alright, hon. Good night. - Good night. That wasn't The Chronicle calling, was it? Publisher, I told her my idea for the rough shape of the series. I pitch it in 10 days. - Wow, that's soon, isn't it? - Yeah, it is. I better get home and put my nose to the grindstone. Since we're already in Brooklyn, I figured we could take a little detour first. If you're going to be a real New Yorker, there's something you need to see. This is incredible! For once, I actually agree with you. This is why I came to New York City. It's just so alive with possibility. Traffic jams and tiny apartments. Stop. Just take it all in. There is nothing else like this view in the whole world. It's unique. I give you that. It's like a dream. Life and movement and energy. It makes me want to draw. Makes me want to eat. Are you hungry? - I can go for a bite. - I'm starving. Of course you are. Do you have some place in mind? Come with me. Thank you. Now this is a real taste of New York. That veggie dog does look pretty good. And I am kind of hungry. Who wouldn't be after a dinner of two lettuce leaves a celery dish that wouldn't feed a rabbit. It was um... refreshing. Here you go, try that. Oh! Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Woah. Ok, don't make fun. I'm not. Not at all. You're really talented. Ok. I mean it. Piper. I want you to do the illustrations for the book pitch. What? I can't believe I didn't realize this sooner. I mean, look at these drawings. They're fun and imaginative. You'd be perfect for the book. That's a crazy idea and also I couldn't possibly illustrate an entire book in two weeks. Just sketches for the key moments of the presentation, that's it. Well, what if they reject your book because they don't like my work? This is your one shot. You should really find a professional artist. Maybe you are a professional artist. Maybe this is exactly what you've been looking for. I know you feel the need to have a steady job that's dependable, but you've tried everything else out. Why don't you try doing something you actually love doing? That is very flattering. But my time in New York is running out and I really need to focus on my long term. Doesn't mean you have to stop looking. Come on, this will be like a fun little side thing. Come on. Wait a second, do you hear that? What? That sound, you can't hear that? No... It's adventure calling. Are you going to answer it or not? Come on. You know, I, uh, I think I hear it now. What do you say? You and me. Ok. I'll do it. Just for fun. For fun. "I'd love to meet at 11:00, Arnold." Wonderful, see you then. Ok. Hey, Mom and Dad. Piper! We haven't heard from you in so long. I know, I've just been really busy. Look, I actually gotta go. Wait, didn't you forget something yesterday? Oh, it was your anniversary! I completely forgot. I've just been so busy and I was working yesterday and then I had a dinner and that ran late. Sorry. It... it's ok, honey. We know you're busy. I'm sure that job of yours has you running all over the city. Actually, that job didn't end up panning out. You got fired? It wasn't like that. Don't worry. I'll work something else out. You keep saying that and it keeps not working out. You had a perfectly good job at the family business and it wasn't good enough. Dad, that is not fair. It's not that it wasn't good enough, I just need to find a life that's right for me. And I hope someday you can support that. But I really gotta go. Love you. They just miss you and care about you a lot. Well, if they want to show that they care they should support me being out here. You know, when I told my parents I was moving to New York, they didn't take it well. And then, when I came out in the same conversation, they really didn't take it well. But that didn't stop me from building a life I wanted for myself. And, you know, eventually they came around. So, you shouldn't let anything stop you either. Thank you for sharing that. I won't. You know, this café really became a home for us once we started to give it a personal touch. So, now it's your turn to make a contribution. I don't have anything to contribute. Of course you do. Your art would look great on the wall. There was this one little sketch I was kind of working on. No way. The café? Oh. I love it. We'll get this framed right up and then this place can start to feel like yours too. Well, Patricia said I would enjoy meeting you. She was right. You're a breath of fresh air. I'd love to hire you as a greeter. Really? It's only part time and I know it's beneath your experience level but it's yours if you want it. That would be wonderful. It's just a greeting position but I'm really looking forward to it. It's a foot in the door. It's oddly comfortable wedged in there. How was your day? Spent anxiously anticipating your thoughts on my book. Oh my gosh. It was great. Truly. It was funny and imaginative but what I really loved the most was your point of view on loneliness. Really? About how all the wishes in the world don't mean anything if you don't have anybody to share it with. I have so many ideas for some sketches. I'm feeling very inspired. Me too. I've been writing up a storm. Can't wait to show you. Do you, um, you want to meet up tonight? Definitely. Ooh, which one of these will best set the mood for toiling away by candlelight? What? I'm a writer, you're an artist, goes with the territory. Hey, I know you're joking, but don't underestimate the power of a good candle. I would never joke about Perfectly Persimmon. It's, um, refreshing. Eh, not the word I'd use. Oooh... Apple pie. Mm-mm-mm. And that is a classic. You can have that one all to yourself. Hm. What about Autumn Woodland? Now that's uh, that's perfect. Oh wow. That is perfect. I um, I should, um, get back to the gallery. My shift starts soon. Right, yeah, yeah, foot in the door. You just gotta break down the hinges and walk right through. Yes. Right, exactly. I... I will see you tonight. You bet. I will take one of those, thank you. What do you think? Well I'm not usually one for abstract art. I can never tell what it's supposed to mean. I used to think the same thing but then I realized that's what makes it unique. Like, where the brushstrokes meet. What does that make you think of? The horizon? And those bursts of color? Two people watching a sunset. I love it. A bit of romance in the air. What do you see? A woman looking at the future version of herself. At what she could become if she were brave enough to try. Well done, Piper. I've been trying to sell this piece for ages. You have a real eye for art. I was just describing what I saw. Well, I see someone who just made 10 percent commission. That's not necessary. You earned it. Are you sure you don't want to rethink illustration as a career? You're really good. Thanks. Wow! It's the first time you haven't shrugged off a compliment about your art. I have to admit, I really love creating these illustrations. I wake up every morning and I can't wait to start working on them. And, um, you can keep the compliments coming. You can say it again. You're really good. And again. You're really, really good. And I can't imagine my book without you. You're really good too, you know that? It's... it's getting late. I should... I should probably get going. Right, yeah. Yeah. I'll uh... - Good night. - Yeah, good night. Yeah. Ok. - See you tomorrow. - Yeah. Uh, where's the portfolio? And where are the backup flash cards? - Oh, I threw them out. - What? Just kidding. Just breathe. You're gonna be great. I feel like I'm gonna throw up. Just go in there and invite her into the world of your story. Show her the spark that inspired you and I know she'll feel it too. What if she doesn't like what she feels? That's impossible because it comes from the heart and your work is strong. Our work is strong and I couldn't have done it without you. I'll make sure the publisher knows that. Mm. Here goes nothing. Here goes everything. Well, Austin, we've got nothing like it on our slate and we'd like to publish it. Wow. I am just going to bask in this feeling for a moment. I'll have our contracts department work out the details. From there, we'll discuss timeline and an illustrator we can pair you with. Oh, I was planning on keeping the original illustrator. The... the one who worked on the pitch samples, Piper Grant. Her work was good, but as a debut author, we'll pair you with a recognizable, established artist. But she, she really, she really brought these books to life. Her work is perfect for the book. The choice of illustrator is the publisher's decision. That's just how it's done. I understand, but she really is the real deal. I can assure you, we will find someone whose work you will love. But, for now, go. Celebrate. You just sold your first series. Congratulations, Austin. Congratulations, Piper. This is huge. You've hit the big time. We need to celebrate. Isn't that what we're doing? No, this is a pre-celebration. I'm throwing you a party next week. But you're already planning one for Piper's birthday. Well, I can party plan multi-task, obviously. So what did your mom say when you told her about the book? Oh, I haven't told her yet. Why not? It seems like perfect vindication. Well, I never told her I got fired from the paper. Austin... you gotta come clean. I promise I will soon. Well, enough celebrating. Back to work. Such a party pooper. I've got dough rising and it's gonna take over the kitchen if I don't get back. So, um, did they say if they had a favorite illustration? Um, yeah, yeah. No, I think she... I think she liked them all. I just want to say thank you for talking me into this. You really were my champion. And to think... my calling was right there in front of me this entire time. Yeah, yeah. But um, make sure you think it through. It's a big step. Yeah, it is and you know, it's scary to leave the security of a 9-5, but I've just got to trust that if I'm doing what I love then everything else will fall into place. So take it slow, you know? Don't quit your day job. Why don't you show your boss your work at the gallery? Seriously? Yeah, would be a good way for you to get your name out there. I mean, you helped sell a book series. It's about time you started promoting yourself. You're right. It suddenly feels like the whole world is opening its doors. Like I've been struck by a bolt of lightning. Cheers. Piper, the paintings for the new exhibit are coming in Monday. I thought you could help decide on wall placement. You have such a good eye. I'd be happy to help. Excellent. Hey, um, Arnold, I was hoping I could ask for a favor. I don't know if I mentioned it before but I actually do sketching in my spare time. Oh. My work was recently used to help sell a book at Snowburry Publishing and I was hoping I could get your professional opinion on my portfolio. It'd be my pleasure. Why don't you leave a copy of your work and I'll look at it this weekend. That would be great. Thank you. Piper... Mom, hi. Two days in a row. Wow, I actually- I was in midtown and I thought I would stop by the paper and visit my son at work but imagine my surprise when I discover that there's no longer an Austin Edwards employed there. I have great news. I thought, surely there must be some sort of mistake. Until your boss told me about the late articles, the sub-par work and that you were fired. I know. Everything I have done has been to help you develop the skills you need to succeed. I know. And at this point, I just, I don't know what more I can do for you. This retrospective for your mom is a big deal. Come on, just come inside. Could be your birthday present to me. It's not your birthday until tomorrow. Well, I'm currently accepting gifts. Or, leads on a new sublet. I don't know about this. I doubt she even wants me in there. It was a heated moment. I'm sure she didn't mean it. She wasn't wrong. I hurt her. I knew what I was doing and I kept doing it anyway. So apologize, and then share with her the good news about the book. She'll be proud. Come on, trust me. Ok. So, there we were, sitting in the Jeep in the middle of the dessert and the prince says, "You have been chasing me for days!" "You never give up. Enough!" And that is how I got the famous interview. I never gave up. So thank you for coming. It is wonderful to see you all. Have a lovely evening and enjoy the party. Thank you. I am so glad you made it. Mom, I'm really sorry. I never meant to hurt you. Can we please just talk about it? I have some really great news. Sweetheart, I've had an amazing career. And I've achieved more than I could have dreamed. But the one thing I never got right was how to be your mother. And it breaks my heart that I failed you. You didn't, Mom. I'm just trying to carve my own path. That's not failing me. It is to me. Ms. Edwards... I think you should know that Austin sold his book. And not just one book, but an entire series. It goes back to what you said about your parents. If you could just see what Austin created, hold it as something tangible... I know you mean well but Austin has a lot to answer for. Patricia! Congratulations! Oh! What an incredible night. Thank you, Alan. You know, again, I am so sorry the way my son acted. You did me a huge favor hiring him. I couldn't be more embarrassed. Don't even think about it. Austin sent me the most beautiful apology note owning all his mistakes. He's a good guy. Congratulations. Hi, Piper. It's Arnold. I had a chance to review your work. It's sweet but not really suited for the New York art gallery scene. There you are! My mom is never gonna see me for who I am. Let alone support me. Don't be so sure. When she sees the wonderful books we're creating, she'll feel differently. Just another reason we have to work super hard. Piper... I don't know how to tell you this... The publisher isn't going to use you as an illustrator on the book. What do you mean? She wants to use someone more established. That's why I tried to convince you to show Arnold your work, so that maybe you could get some gallery recognition and that your work would gain value. Right. 'Cause my work has no value. Of course it does. I um... I gotta, I gotta go. Piper... Happy birthday to me. Thank you. I'm really gonna miss you guys. Oh. I couldn't have asked for better friends. Please stay for your birthday party. I uh, I would love to but I gotta be realistic. My two months is up and I took my shot, and it just didn't work out. But you worked so hard. And just think about all the jobs you tried. You were such a champion. Wait, say that again? Um, you were a champion. I... No, um, would you, sorry, open the back? Open the... Would you guys mind, um, just watching this stuff for a little while? - Uh... - Um... So a bit of change of plans. Piper, you in there? I've been thinking about something that you told me. About always being my own champion. So, I have a question. Ask away. I came to New York City and I found my calling. Which is? To be an illustrator. Here in the city that inspires me. That's wonderful, Piper. So, what's your question? You said that you need to be your own champion. You said that you always need to fight for yourself. Well, I have and I've failed. So my question is, how do I know if the universe is telling me that it's time to give up or if I just need to fight harder? What makes you think you've failed? Every door that I tried to get through just keeps getting slammed in my face. It's so frustrating. I... I can't get hired because I'm unknown and I can't become known unless I'm hired and I don't know what to do. Piper, how do you think established people get established? If a door gets closed, you bust it down. If you don't do it, someone else will. Either you believe in yourself or you don't. Well aren't you going to stay for tea? Thank you for the offer but I've got some door-busting to do. You're amazing, by the way. Hey, Will! Have either of you guys seen Piper? She was just heading to the airport and then she suddenly changed her mind. Where'd she go? No idea. The only thing we do know is that she is coming back before she leaves again. Ms. Snowburry? My name is Piper Grant and no, I don't have an appointment, but I'm gonna ask for three minutes of your time. And why would I give you any time at all? Because I'm an illustrator. I'm not established, my work is not recognizable. Actually, no one has ever heard of me. But they will. Because I'm good. I am really, really good. I'm such an idiot. There's gotta be a way to fix this. Fix what? I've been terribly unfair to Piper. She's worked so hard on this book. You really like this girl. Told you. I should have pushed for her harder. Maybe you still can? You turned down my illustrations for Austin Edwards' new book series but I'm wondering if you really looked at my work or you just dismissed it out of hand because I'm unknown. It's not personal. It's company policy. We use established illustrators who's work we know is outstanding. Fair enough. But I'm gonna ask you to look again and if you don't think it is outstanding and absolutely perfect for the series, then I will thank you for your time and I will leave. Fair enough. ♪ This here is a fresh start ♪ ♪ It's a new day for a brave heart ♪ ♪ If you're ready, if you're ready ♪ Pipe! Piper! Where've you been?

I told her we're a package deal. And what did she say? She said I was too late. She already found an illustrator who'd be perfect for the book. You. We did it. No, you did it. What did you even say to her? I took some advice from a very wise woman. And I doubled down on myself. So does that mean you're gonna stay?
