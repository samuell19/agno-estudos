Ready? For the fridge I look over here. And over there for the woman? Exactly. Camera is the fridge. The woman is here. Alright, I want to see some energy! 3-2-1. Action! I... Sorry, one sec. Can we take it again? Cut. I asked if you memorized it already. - Yes. - But you didn't. - I looked at the woman. - Okay, whatever. Let's start again. 3-2-1. Action! I can't love you more than your fridge because your fridge is Donadona. Then forget about me in hell's fire. Alright, fetch me some cold water then, so I can drink it to my heart's desire. Okay, very nice! Thank you, good job. Should we try again? Because I have another character in mind I wanna try out. That was good. I even laughed, didn't you hear? I already know the director's style. You did a pretty good job. It's obvious you are an actor. I get all that energy from here. Now, let's have a short intro. Name, surname, age, height, weight. Nothing more. Okay? - Okay. - Let's go then! Ready? Smiling and energy is high. So, hello. I'm Ali Ilıksüt. I'm 1.67 meters tall and I weigh 80 kg. I'm 35 years old. Currently, I perform in theater plays. I don't have any on-camera experience. Any commercials on air right now? I don't have any on-camera experience. Okay. Right and left profiles. Now to the other side. Now, turn to the camera and smile, Ali. Okay, good job. Thank you. You, too. Can we please take one last time? This was good. I know the director's style and the character. Everything's alright! I have a performance tonight, at the 'Mösyö' at 20:30. You're invited. Well, you see we're really busy. Okay? I won't promise. If you come, tell them, you are a guest of Ali Ilıksüt. They'll let you in. If it's crowded, they... Deal, Ali. Okay? But no promises. I'll try. - Thanks, good luck. - Good job, see you. Thanks. - You say, you got it already. - Yes, I loved it, bye. Okay guys, next! Guys, you don't get in first by waiting there. Everyone in their turn! You, come here. How many people? Any online sales? I told him it wasn't good. "No, it was perfect", he said. He even said he laughed. Such a lie. I know, it wasn't good. I know myself. It's not like I'd get the part but I went all the way down there. When it's all for nothing, it makes me angry. Don't be ridiculous, you've got this. I'm not a face to be used in commercials. What's that got to do with it? I am not, really. I'm not the face to be used in commercials. - You acted in so many commercials. - So what? You have the talent. You're beautiful. You have a face for commercials. Okay, but your face goes well with comedy. I can't do a comedy, for instance. There wasn't any suitable project for you. Be patient. Only one person bought a ticket for tonight. - Tuncay. - And is that Tuncay? For God's sake... Why does he come to every show? Is he supposed to come to every show because he's the sponsor? Is it a rule? Let's hope he'll bring some others, too, at least. Okay, I will tell him. Did you share it on Instagram? I mean yes, but it won't make any difference. You know that. I'm hungry. I'll eat something. Do you want to come? No, I won't. Don't eat too much before the play. I don't mind it. And to be clear, if Tuncay is the only one, I won't do it. Ali, we've talked about this many times. - Even if one person comes, we still… - I won't, Ceren! I won't! I will contact some friends on Whatsapp, maybe they'll come. Paid or not, they should come. You tell your friends as well. Let's not play for an empty hall. Hello? Veysel? What's up? Hello? Mehmet? You always call me actor, player, etc. But when are you coming to see me? Same old, I have a play tonight. You're coming, right? Oh no... I was going to invite you to the play tonight. We have this play tonight. I always tell you this, but you couldn't make it yet... No, I don't think we'll perform there, we'll always be here. Okay, if we ever perform there, I'll let you know, of course. I will. Okay, see you. Thanks. Thanks. Bon appetit. Are you an actor? - I've never seen a play. - For real? I really want to but I never had the chance. - When is your shift over? - At 8 pm. Then come to our play. We perform at the 'Mösyö', right here. - How much does it cost? - You will come as my guest. Just say that you are a guest of Ali's. They'll let you in. Bring your friends as well. Bring as many as you can. That would be so cool, thank you so much. Then, we'll be two people. - Two people? Is that all? - Yes. Well, whatever. You two come then, okay? Okay. How much do I pay now? A pastry and a tea, right? 14 Turkish liras. Here. I had another tea before the meal... Thanks for reminding me. It'll be 16. Here, take it. I wish you had come to the audition as well. There were female roles, too. We would've helped each other, it'd have been good. - You mean Donadona? - Yes. No, they wouldn't have me. I was in a commercial for a rival company. The oven. That was a good one but it's ridiculous. This has to change. Don't others use other brands of appliances? They do! They do! This has to change. They pay so little, ask for too much... Hello! - Good to see you, Tuncay. - Good to see you, too. Some energy for the play... Just came from our tour in Antalya. Tangerines! They're organic. Ali, that's for you. Thank you, thanks but you came early. There's plenty of time before the play. Well, I wanted to do something nice for myself today. So I got time off from work. Because, after the play, an Argentinian group will come, and we'll do something with them. You won't see me after the play. I thought I'd come and we'd chat a little. You did great, such a nice idea, but... We have to practice with Ceren. You know, that final scene, we can't get it quite right. Let's work that out today, huh? - So sorry, Tuncay. Our bad. - No, no. By the way, let me say this. Because I've seen all the plays, I memorized all the lines! I mean, God forbid, if something bad happens to you Ali... You and I, Ceren… we can come out and rock this play together. Ali, you got competition. Really, just so you know, you got competition. Okay, okay. I couldn't do what you do, for example. Managing a travel agency is a hard job, right? Of course, I'm just joking. I couldn't possibly do it like you guys. I already know you're joking. It's not like you're going to go on the stage. Look, you always supported us. Thank you so much. We both do. I think you feel an extra responsibility because you are the sponsor. You literally came to all the shows. You got sick, you came. It rained, you came. You always came. You never missed a show. You've been here since the beginning. When I'm on stage, I look at the audience and I see Tuncay. And I get happy. But don't come to all of our shows. You do so much already. Please don't see it that way. That'd make me sad, because... as Ceren enters the stage, then the music starts, and then the lights… It makes me so happy, too I love... I mean, acting, theater... They all seem so magical to me. That's it. Alright then. I won't bother you anymore. I'm right outside. If you need anything, you can call me. Thank you so much, Tuncay. How kind of you. Okay then. Have a nice one. See you. - See you. - See you. See, he didn't bring anyone else again but I will tell him next time. It's not working, can't you see? I can't go on without you. I understand it better now. I went to the best restaurant in the city. I watched the stars again from our hill. I did everything again and again, but it's not the same without you. - I wish you hadn't left me like that. - I wish. I can't do this anymore. I give up. I'll wait to die. My love... You are an artist. Artists are real artists only when they can keep up with the times and they are ready to stay strong against all the hardship. And you, my love. You can keep up with anything and any period of time. You shall live. Huh, well done. Why does this keep happening, for real... Can you give me the... There were only six people, for God's sake. Two of them are Tuncay and Burak, and there is the two I invited. Who were the other two, I wonder. It was the director of my last commercial. The other one must be his friend. I invited him, he came thankfully. Let's go out and say hi, okay? Who were the ones that you invited? You know that place I eat. They were the waiter and his friend. Good thing you did, they liked it. - Good job, guys. - Thanks. - Tangerines? - No, thanks. Was the energy a little low today? You know I don't feel like playing when there are so few people. Why do you say that? It was nice, not bad. Ceren, of course, we have a standard. I'm not saying it was that bad. But when I compare it to the last one, I find this a little lower. Should we change the ending? The play is great and it ends on a high note, too. It ends on a high note but it feels like it doesn't really climax. If you two kiss for instance... How many times did we talk about this? You did a great job writing and directing. We're doing a good job, acting. And if there is an audience, they like it. Okay, that's it. Don't push it. Look, there's a director here. Let's go, say hi and network a little. Is he a director? He wasn't that into it. Let me ask you something. Did you write this play together? No, I wrote and directed the play. If you have any feedback, I'd like to hear it. To be honest, I don't really like theater that much. I'm not going to lie. But your play was really unique. - What did you like the most? - It's not that important. Your acting is really natural. I already know Ceren from the commercial. You're awesome, Ceren. Ali, you've got some real talent as well. I even told Duygu while watching the play. I said don't miss on out that guy. Hi, I'm Duygu. I'm an agent. Are you working with anyone? No, I mean, there's someone but there is no contract. And he finds commercial gigs all the time. I'd rather be part of a series, a movie, or streaming gigs. Let's do it like this, if you'd like. Come by my office tomorrow and we'll have a chat. - Maybe we'll work together? - Of course, we'll come together then. Wait a minute! I have a pretty sweet job right now. Why don't you try that out, too? In fact, let's do it like this. Come straight to 'Y Production' tomorrow. I'll be there. There are some 'callbacks'. I'll let you in. When they're done, they'll come to my office. It's so close. Search for 'Duygu Talent', and you'll find. Okay then. - Let's go then? - Yes let's go. Ceren, thank you so much for inviting us. Thank you very much, Bahadır. It was nice seeing you. My dear, thank you. See you guys. Bye! Bring black t-shirts as well, so we can take some photos, too. - See you, everyone. - See you. Thanks. Not many people showed up, as usual, mom. Really? And you invite all these people, I don't get it. Not even İrem didn't show up? No, they didn't come either but something good has happened. A director showed up, mom. Do you remember the commercials Ceren was in? He was the director of one of those. That's really good, then. Did you talk to him? I did, yes. We had a chat after the play. He really liked my acting and invited me for an audition. I hope it goes well, my love. I hope so, too. I mean it's a commercial, but it's still good for me. There was also an agent with him. She works with TV series. Maybe she's good as well. Will you sign with her, then? I don't know that yet. We'll talk about it tomorrow. What's up with you? We're doing okay. Everything's the same. Your dad is here, too. By the way, he sent you some money. You didn't need to though... Tell us when you need money again, okay? He says, hi, as well. He is watching a game right now. Thank you. Tell him I say, hi. See you then, pray for me, okay? Of course, my love. I always do. Don't forget to call your grandparents. They say you never call them. Okay, okay I'll call them. Okay then, good night. - See you, son. - See you. Ali! What's up, man? Good, not much. What about you? Good. Come and sit down, I'll buy you tea. I have an interview. I won't hold you that long, come on! It's been a while! 15 minutes, come on! I missed you, bro. - What kind of interview is this? - A commercial audition. Commercial's good, too. You just go for one day, and if they pay you well even better! Yeah, but a series is better. Because it's a long term thing. Yeah, but It's really exhausting, man. We're on set at from 7:00 in the morning until midnight. - Four days a week. - But they pay you accordingly. Yeah, that's true. I bought a flat. - Good for you. - Thanks. - Where? - I moved to Cihangir. Nice. We'll see man, there is some new stuff. I'm reading a script. - Haluk is in the project as well. - You worked with him before right? - How is he? - He really is a legend. - Everyone says that. - Suat! Get us another round man. - No need, I still have plenty. - And we'll drink another one. Look, bro. You're always on my mind. If someone asks, I'll tell your name. But I don't know anything about the casting and all. Yeah, I understand. How's Ceren doing? She's fine, we are doing a play together this year. I saw that, yes! But I couldn't find the time to come to see it. I mean, we have an audience issue. The play is good but because there's no audience… Sorry, bro. I've just posted a photo. They keep sending likes. The DMs are crazy, I'm deleting some messages. My followers are now 600.000, I can't believe it. What were you saying? Our play, I was saying. We share it on Insta, too. But because our followers are so few, we don't really attract people. If we had more followers, there'd be more people. The number of followers is an issue. We don't have many. It's not happening because of this followers thing. I got you, bro. Okay then, let me pay… Oh, don't be ridiculous, good luck man, go get the part. Say hi to Ceren, okay? Let's get together soon like in the old theater days. I hope so, okay. There is a commercial that Bahadır directs. I'm here for that. - What was your name again? - Ali Ilıksüt. Okay. You'll have to wait for a little. Can you please fill out this form? - Donadona, right? - Yes. Ali Ilıksüt from yesterday's list is here but the director didn't choose him. Just get an audition and send him home. It wasn't me, who called him. I can get that if you're done. What's up, Ali? - Is Bahadır here? - He's a bit busy. What are you doing here? Nothing. I just wanted to chat with him a little. He actually invited me himself. Because he's a bit busy right now, I'll record your audition video. Mr. Bahadır! Hi! - Sorry to keep you guys waiting. - No worries. Now, Burak. I'm not that interested in shooting movies anymore. Why not? Why? I tried it out for a while in the past. But because you lose money, finding a producer is impossible. You search for sponsors, they don't get back. The problems with actors' agents... I mean, tons of stuff like that. I've had enough, to be honest. Maybe we can try this. You send me your play, okay? I'll read it, and maybe I'll forward it to some other friends. Thank you so much, sir. I don't like to brag about my work, really. In my story, there's both love and comedy. You know that stories like this are always popular in this country, right? Yeah, that's true. They're loved but you should focus more on real stories. Since your story is a bit surreal. - Real stories, you say? - Yes. I have stories like that as well. I can send them to you one by one if you want. And you can give me your feedback? Send me whatever you wrote, Burak. Okay? Okay, deal. Thank you so much. By the way, before I go, I'd like to add something. You came to see our play yesterday. Thank you. We were very happy about that. If you have any comments about the play, I'd love to hear them as well. I already told you Burak. I loved the play, congratulations again. - What did you like the most? - The way it was written. I loved it. I wanted to use plain language. Though, I'm still not happy with the ending. I told Ali and Ceren as well. If we can make these two characters kiss, we'll have a much better ending. I believe it'll elevate the impact of it but I couldn't persuade these two. Don't you think 'More is less'? 'More is Less', that's right. Leave the play as it is. - It's awesome like this. - Right? We've told him this many times - but nice to hear it from you, too. - Yes. - Thank you so much again for your time. - You're welcome. Ali, good luck to you. See you. Thank you so much. Thank you, Burak. Ali, shall we start? Come on. I'd also like to ask something before the shoot. If that's okay. - Go ahead, ask me. - What're the criteria for your decisions? - What do you mean? - You know, we come all this way and... The truth is that I've been to many auditions but I got rejected from all of them. Of course, there were some where I was shortlisted but then I didn't hear from them. So I wonder... Is acting really important? Or do they care more about appearance? Because in all the auditions that I go to they always ask me if I can get a haircut or shave my beard. You know, right from the start. And I think... Can't they picture it in their heads? I have to grow them out for my job. We're always chasing something, maybe a period drama. Look, acting is important, very important, but... As a director, I first choose the actor. Then I tell the agency that I'd like to proceed with that actor. They can't decide by themselves. They call the brand. What does the brand say? They say they have a particular strategy. I mean, they say, they're looking for a new face, new energy. Then we all gather together and say if there is an actor who meets these criteria altogether, then that's the face we are looking for. You got it? Yes, I got it. It's a matter of chance. Ceren! - How's it going? - Hi, I'm fine, thanks. You? Fine. Come. I'll treat you to a milkshake. I'm going to a meeting right now. - Is it an audition for a commercial? - No, I'll see an agent. - Just ten minutes! - Let's do it another time? What is it? Are you cross with me or something? - No, that's not the case! - Then come for a while. Okay, just for a little while. - What's up? - Not much, what about you? Fine. Suat! Will you get us a milkshake, man? I can't love you more than your fridge because your fridge is Donadona. Then forget about me in hell's fire. Alright, fetch me some cold water then, so I can drink it to my heart's desire. That's it! Nice, okay. These are enough for me, Ali. That was pretty good. Great. - You really think that? - That was pretty good, okay. Nice. If you are happy with it... I thought I acted a bit over the top. I mean the second one. I am telling you, it was good. Okay. I thought maybe I could do it more like... Your fridge is Donadona... Alright, fetch me some... I mean a bit more natural maybe. Ali, it was good, pretty good. Okay? Ali, if you get the part, would you be okay with shaving off your beard? - Yes, yes. - Ali, thanks for coming. I hope we'll work together. We'll let you know, okay? Okay, I'd like that very much. I'll go see Duygu now. - Oh, her office is so close. Say hi! - Of course, I will. - Okay then, let's go. - I'll get dressed and leave then. You should stop hanging out with Ali. He's such a mess. If you keep talking nonsense, I'll leave. - He's a great actor. I can see that. - Yes, I love being on stage with him. Act in whatever you like but go to auditions for series, too. Look, you're beautiful and talented as well. I mean, if the agent is a good one, maybe I'll find something. I don't know. I could tell my agent about you but she won't work with people, who have no TV acting experience. It'd be hard for you. - I understand. - Dear, you misunderstood me. Think a bit more professional. Whatever, let's not talk about this. - You got a boyfriend? - Can! If you don't give anyone a chance because of me... Stop with that nonsense, please. - Hey, hello! Can! - Hello. - Can we have a photo together? - Of course, give me your phone. Ceren, can you take it please? Thank you so much. - Don't I look handsome? - Yes, very. - When's the new project? - I'll announce it on Insta, dear. - Thank you. - By the way, my mother adores you. - Oh, is that so? Tell her I said, hi. - I'll tell her that. - Thank you. - Goodbye. - I must go now. - You didn't drink your milkshake! - You can have it. - Okay, let's get together some day. - The old theater group, okay? - Okay. Currently, I am focused on TV series. I already know most of the producers. The other day, I was with Necati. We talked about his new project and what we should do with it, you know. Cast directors are all my friends. So I hear about all the new projects as soon as they are launched. How nice. Normally, I work without a contract. I wonder, if it is necessary. Yes, it is. Because you're friends of Bahadır, of course, you are exclusive. I've seen both of your performances. You guys are indeed talented. We can do it like this. After our first project is confirmed, we'll sign a contract. - If that's okay with you too, of course. - I think that's awesome. Couldn't agree more. Awesome! You're already wearing a black t-shirt, Ali. - Let's take your photos now. - I've got one with me as well. Excellent! I adore professional actors. Let me give you this one as well. If you memorize it now, we can try that out. What's this? It's a new series. Haluk Bilginer is in the cast, as well. Ceren, I don't think there's a woman character for you in this one. There are no seasons now, new series are coming all the time. I got in touch with some of them. I'm sure something will come up. Then Can is in the cast as well, right? Can Ayarlı. Yes, he is. Is he a friend of yours? - We were performing in the same theater. - He is so talented. I adore him. It's like he is made for the cameras. You're happy. You're sad. Something surprised you! You're angry. Now, you are furious! You're happy again. Thank you. Let's get to the audition. I'll make you get down on your knees! You'll regret this! You'll ask for forgiveness and beg for mercy, Cevher Defterdar! Since the first day you came here, I was nothing but respectful to you. You always tried to bring me down. You hit me below the belt and above the belt. You keep hitting saying that you were right. But it's over now. I won't fall for your games anymore. You'll pay for what you did. You hear me? Huh? Do you? One by one, you'll pay for it! Cut. That's nice. But let's do one more where you are more intense, angrier. And at the end, try to look cooler. That's what they want. - Who does? - You know, how they always act on TV. Do the directors want me to act like this or is it because the other actors act like this? Ali, my dear, it's better if they see something familiar. I read the part like that as well, screaming and with more intensity. More of something like that. Scenes like this are usually very loud. So you want something like this. You, you... You'll pay for all the things you did! You heard me? Did you? I'll make you pay one by one even if it's the last I'll do! - Something like this? - Exactly! Come on, let's do it. It's better if I don't do it like this, though. What do you think Ceren? I mean, if you don't want to, you don't have to, I guess. Maybe yours is more unique. Everyone must have just shouted. - Yeah, I think so, too. - Okay, then. It's up to you. Don't get me wrong. It has nothing to do with you. - No. Not at all. - I'm not comfortable with it. Oh no, really. Not at all, don't worry. Is this for one of the leads or just a few episodes? One of the leads. Shall we start taking the photos? Come on. When you look at it... The woman straight off handed me an audition for a series. I don't know if I should have acted it so. - Did I do the wrong thing? - What? Didn't you? Man, you are an actor! You should do whatever they say. I don't think you'll lose the job just because of that. I also don't think that woman knows what she's doing. Let me ask you something else. Why don't you work with famous agents? They don't want to work with us. How do you know? Have you ever asked? They want experience. Experience, you get it? You must have done something. For you to do something, they must help you. For them to help you, you must have already done something. - Did you ever ask them that? - We sent them an e-mail. They said, they were full, and weren't able to take anyone else in. - You see? - An e-mail does not work, guys. You have to go there and talk. Sending an e-mail is nothing. I don't know about Ali but Ceren, you'd definitely get in by being beautiful. Well, it seems I'm not that beautiful after all. You got to have connections in this industry. - Can, for example. - Which one? You know the guy who used to perform with us. That annoying guy, the blonde one! Can Ayarlı! What's he doing by the way? I'm going to call him, just a sec. No, don't do it here. I ran into him on my way to the audition and we had a little chat. - Me, too. - He blabbered about buying a flat. - He bought a house? - Yeah, and his followers... Whatever, that's not my point. What I'm trying to say is that, this man Rıza... his uncle got him in the TV series, okay? He got the job just because he's handsome! That's it! Is he talented? Do you see any talent? Not even close! When you have an uncle like that, you get the job! All of our efforts are in vain, really. You see, for example, he calls Haluk Bilginer 'Haluk', for God's sake! It is what it is, really! Agent Duygu, agent this and that... They are not important. What are you doing? Typing and typing for the last two hours? I'm working, bro. I'm writing a play. I'm working on a one-woman show. It's going to be big! Ceren, I'm going to make you win the Afife Jale award, think about it. For real. You may laugh now. Laugh, really. I'd laugh too, laugh. He has such confidence. The real world isn't like that. You're such a daydreamer, you live upon the clouds! We faced the reality once again today. Maybe he's the right one. Hello? Sleeping beauty, are you still sleeping? Such an actor. What is it, Veysel? You didn't write back, and I thought I'd call. It's noon. I didn't think you were still asleep. I went to bed late. What is it? We made the reservation for 8 pm tonight. I sent you the location. If it'd be hard for you, I can pick you up. Is it today that we are meeting? God, I can't believe you, man! I'm hanging up now. See you tonight. The Actor! In my play, I've touched upon the subject of inequality too. I've never understood, how a woman and a man can get paid differently doing the same job. Yes, as a director and a writer, I find this issue extremely upsetting. Yes, Mehtap, in order to let the masses know about this issue, we have to fill this theater up this time. I expect support from you regarding this, yes. - Who is he talking to? - Of course. I don't know. He's been talking non-stop since the morning. I woke up because of him. I'm trying not to listen. In order to tell this to the audience... - Are you hungry? - Very much. You? Me, too. What should we eat? I'm telling a story of a woman, trying to survive in a patriarchal world. Let's go to the pastry place. Ceren, eat some of mine, too. I overdid it, I guess. Normally, I'd eat it but my friends from high school invited me to dinner. - I'm saving myself for that. - Sure, I'd gladly take it. Tuncay invited me to dinner tonight as well. Yeah? That's strange. Is he in love with you or something? I mean, it looks like it. Why do you think that? I don't know. He comes to see all of our shows. If he wasn't the sponsor, we couldn't perform there, that's true. It's a bit weird that he comes to see all the shows because he's the sponsor. I don't think he's coming to see me. I don't know. Maybe he'll talk about his feelings tonight. How are you holding up? Any new projects or something? Doing the same play you haven't seen. In case maybe you'd come to see it some day. Ali, honey. You know we have a newborn. And I just started working. - He's in my mom's place now. - We did that as well, he's at my mom's. He just started going to school. Some new problem always shows up. We don't have a social life anymore but I really admire you. You're fighting for what you believe in, it's wonderful. I've been together with Oktay for nearly 2 months. I told him we should go and see your play at least 10 times. It's so far away from us, man. Won't you perform anywhere closer? - No, we'll be always there. - Can you give me that sauce? Ali, I want to ask you something. At the backstage... Men and women, do you all get dressed together at the same place? I mean, it's like... So, sometimes, during the plays in order to save time, yes, we do it together but usually changing rooms are different. The steak here is awesome. Did you taste it? - No. - I loved it. There's also this... - Excuse me. - No problem. I mean, it's not always like this. For example... Sometimes we need to be quick at the backstage but we only think about the play at that moment, you know? - Yeah, yeah. - Isn't it the same for you too? I remember watching something about it on TV. On a catwalk show, models were running naked all around the place. Of course, but they're all women there. Yeah, of course, there's only women!! The stylists, hairdressers, make-up artists who help us get ready, they are all women. - Burçin... Oktay surprised us. - Why do you say that? We were expecting Ali to date a model but Oktay happened to find you. Ali will find, too. He is an actor for God's sake! Ali doesn't look like much of an actor... Ali, your friend, what was her name... - Ceren? - Oh, yes. Ceren. - Nothing romantic between you two? - No. She's just a friend. Any intimacy, butterflies or something, nothing? - So when you guys kiss... still nothing? - No, not at all. There's no kissing in the play. It's not like it wasn't considered. - Not Ceren, Burak wants us to kiss. - Burak? The director of the play. He wants it but there's still no kissing in the play. There wouldn't be anything between us, even if there was one. I mean, let's say something happened between us... It wouldn't be because we kissed while we act, it's like that. Our play has nothing to do with... I mean, we're only acting, right? - Of course. - So, nothing at all, you say. Stop it, please, man. They're artists, man. They're performing. We shouldn't think otherwise. - Thank you. - The check's here. - Is it right? - Yeah, yeah. No, please. Let us take it. - No, let me pay mine. - Stop, man. Please, come on. - Thank you, guys. - Bon appetit. Ceren, what's up, are you back? I've just come home. So, what did you guys do? We had dinner at a fancy place, that's it. Anything else? He said, he likes me. Then he gave me a necklace. I'm very tired. I'll go to bed now. Good night. Melek? - How are you? - Fine, thanks. I came out to tell you, there is a 10% raise in the rent next month. - Why? - You know, the contract is over. 10% is too much, let's not do that this year. Ali, look! Actors like you live underground in this neighborhood. You live on an upper floor, be grateful. The building is so old. There is the risk of an earthquake, too. I'm scared to be honest. All buildings around here are old. Also, you've got yourself a furnished flat. The flowers, the library, also the fridge, and the bed... Your furnitures are retro. They're valuable, you know? - Okay then, let's make it 5% this year. - I don't make the rules. It's 10% according to the contract. If it were up to me, it'd be 20%. Okay. How many people? It's either three or five people. Sometimes four. Most of the time, two. Why is it always like this? - Is our acting bad? You always watch it. - No, I love the play. - Is there a problem with our acting? - Ali, stop talking nonsense. Your acting is great. But maybe if we just put a kissing at the end... Nobody wonders what kind of a kisser I am. People will say, go see this play because there is a kissing scene in it? We don't advertise it, that's the problem. - Should we push more on social media? - No offense but you're blabbering. - We're sort of too luxurious, you know? - Luxurious? The ticket costs 30 liras. 1 kg of Baklava is 90 liras. Our play isn't even worth half of that. - Some tickets are 100 liras. - No correlation between the two. What is it got to do with baklava? We're too expensive for someone who's going to pay 30 liras. That's it! People don't go pay 30 liras for a play. They pay 100! People who're willing to pay 30 liras, save it, and then go to a play of 100 liras. They go to see a celebrity, at least. They take photos, and share them in their stories, and brag about it. 100 liras for the whole package. They look at our poster, see my face and they're like: "Ali Ilıksüt, who was that…" "No, I can't figure out who that is…" "Next!" They say! They see the other poster. "Wow", they say. They see a celebrity on the poster with a huge photo. "If s/he's in it, the play must be really good." "We must go", they say. This the perception! It is what it is! We are not celebrities! We're 'no-names'. 'No-name' is what we are. That is the problem. Let's face it. You go to a celebrity play, it is what it is. If you go to theater in Turkey, you go to a celebrity play! They go see Nejat Uygur, Yıldız Kenter or Zeki Alasya. Bro, they're all dead. I mean that level of fame, you'd go for their level. They wouldn't go see Ali Ilıksüt, get it? I mean... I don't know. Forget about me. Isn't it a shame for this girl? You see how talented she is. She performs for no audience. For real, sometimes I want to take this fork and commit hara-kiri. Ali, don't talk nonsense now. Guys, you exhausted me, for real. I swear, I feel depressed now. What are you doing? Pull yourselves together. We're working, trying... We're shamelessly insistent. I'll be your savior again, for real. - Should we go? - Yeah, okay. - Yes. - Burak, you can take care of the check using today's fantastic earnings. Okay! I'll save you and I'll pay the check as well, okay! Everything's on me. Man, come on. It's our money. Pay it, please. - Okay, okay. What did you eat? - They'd know. Who's that? Oh, it's Tuncay. - He says he loved the performance. - Oh, how kind. - So he loved this one as well? - Yeah, he did. How nice. How's it going between you two? - It's all the same, you already know. - How do you mean? Nothing new, all the same. I believe, he's well off too, right? Oh, yeah. I mean that's what he says. So, I guess he is. He's getting ready for new tour locations, his business is growing. There are carefree people in this world, like him. I find this really strange. Geez, Ali, our troubles would never end, you know that. Also actors need trouble. Without any, you are not a real actor. Right! - Is that so, really? - I paid it. Come on. How are you doing son? I'm fine, mom. How are you? I'm fine, sweetheart. Is there any news on that audition you were talking about? No, not yet. Well, let's hope for the best. There's a girl I want to talk to you about. She's a teacher. Mom, you know that I'm not interested. I hardly make any money, how can I think about marriage? It's not like you'll get married right away. You'll meet first. You are underestimating yourself. Here, when I say that my son is an actor, everyone's all impressed. Then they ask, if I'm in something they might know. Did you eat something, sweetheart? Yes, I did. Ali... They are forcing your father to retire. Well then, that's great... I mean... He's worked non-stop for all these years. He needs a rest. So he won't be getting paid as he used to. That's not important, mom. Resting will be good for him, I guess. Yeah, of course. Mom, can I call you later? I've got to do something. Okay? I'm hanging up. Good night, sweetheart. Say hi to my father as well, and tell him congratulations on my behalf. Okay, don't stay up too late. Make your decision! Who do you love more? Me or this thing? I can't possibly love you more than your fridge because your fridge is Donadona. Then forget about me in hell's fire. Alright, fetch me some cold water then, so I can drink it to my heart's desire. With its X-Freeze technology, Donadona keeps your food fresh 5 times longer! Donadona keeps it cool, Donadona... Is there a play today? Tell me, is there even a play today! - Ali, what are you up to? - What are you doing here? Burak told us to get together for the new play. - Is there a meeting? - Yes, he already told you. - No, he didn't. - Look at your phone, he must've told you. - No. - Ali, look at your phone, he must have. Then he probably did, I don't know, okay? - I'm leaving anyway. - Why are you packing your things? - I'm quitting, Ceren. - What? Didn't you see the man they picked for Donadona? That ridiculous man. You're quitting because of a stupid commercial? Ceren, I'm so tired, I can't do this anymore. They didn't even pick me for a stupid commercial like Donadona. TV series or movies are already pipe dreams. Ali, I've been calling you all day. Why don't you pick up? Forget about me. You're an actor. You have to pick up whenever they call you. - Okay, I'm leaving. - Where? We're going to read the play. - You two can read it, I'm leaving. - What's going on? Man, let me go already. - Okay. - Ali, let us talk first… - Where is he going? - He's giving up acting. What? Giving up acting? You'll pay for these words, you'll pay for what you did! You heard me? Huh? Did you?! Hey! What is that? - An amazing series is coming. - Really? What is it? The trailer for Can Ayarlı's new series just came out. Since the day you came here, I've been nothing but respectful to you! But you always tried to bring me down! You hit me from below and above. You always hit me! But it's over now. I won't fall for your games anymore. You'll pay for your words, you'll pay for what you did! Do you hear me? Do you? Istanbul is Mine. - People will love it, for sure. - For sure, yeah. He shouted and screamed as well, no doubt it will be a hit. - Can I get some tea? - Yeah, sure. - Hi. - Hello, Duygu. - Yeah? - Hi. Hello. Do you remember the audition text from last time? The one you gave me? - For a series. - Yes. I've just seen the trailer of it. - They did not select you. - Yeah, I figured I didn't get the part. My other three actors got into the main cast. - Is that so? - Yes. - All three of them? - Yes. - Congratulations. - Oh dear, thank you. Well, are there any auditions, you think that might be suitable for me? You said, there are a lot of new series coming out. Not at the moment, sorry. I understand, okay. Then let's do it like this. Let's not suggest me anymore. - You can take me out of your list. - Okay. Why? Don't get me wrong. It's got nothing to do with you. It's about me, this is what I want. Okay. Good luck then. Thanks, thank you. Hey, let's cancel that tea. - Ali, why don't you drink something? - I'll dive right into the issue. Okay. I thought maybe you have a job for me here. I quit the theater. So you won't be performing with Ceren anymore? No, I mean, with no one. I quit it altogether. Didn't you love acting, I mean? I mean, yes. But I had to quit, Tuncay. It's over. Okay? So, what do you say? You're not experienced in this field, right? You told me how you can never do my job, tourism and all? No, but… You know, I'm an actor so, I'm good with words. - You're an actor, you're good with words. - Yes. Sure. Okay then, I'm going to hire you. Would you like to start as a salesperson? I just launched a South Asia tour but you can take the Spain-Portugal tours. Your bonus would be higher because more customers sign up for that. We already have insurance. The wage is 3000 liras plus bonuses, food and transportation. Bonus? You get 7,5% commission per each sale you make. If you sell a tour worth 100 liras, you'll get 7,5 liras. 7,5 liras. If you sell a tour of worth 1000 liras, 75 liras would be yours. If it's 3000, 5000, even better, even higher. - It's always 7,5%? - Yes. - So if I can't sell anything at all... - 3000 liras. - That's set, right? - Plus transportation and food. It's okay for me. Okay, okay then, welcome. - Good luck. - Thank you, Tuncay. Rather than a T-shirt, you should wear a shirt, okay? Of course. It's just for today, I didn't know what to wear. - Okay. - I'll do that. Hey everyone, can you look over here for a second? Ali just started working with us. He's an old friend of mine, and now he's going to be with us. Ali, you'll work with Burcu. Burcu, it'd be awesome if you can help Ali with Spain-Portugal tours. - Of course, sure. - Great. Thank you, Tuncay. I mean, Mr. Tuncay. It's Mr. here but outside it's always Tuncay, you know that. Tuncay, Ali. Okay? - See you tomorrow, then. - Tomorrow is Saturday. Our only day-off is Sunday. We work from 8:30 am to 6:30 pm every day, including Saturday. At noon, we have one hour lunch break. - Okay. - Okay? See you then. Have a good one, everyone. Good luck. Have a good one. No one's left. Everyone's gone now. They said, "you are alone". I was already lonely. Cut. Ceren, we'll get here anyway. First, you have to say something to the audience. Come forward, look at the audience. Then, tell these to them. Not to yourself. So I should make eye contact with them? Of course, it's always like this in monologues, Ceren. Burak, it's a one-person play. There are times this character has internal monologues. And times she has external ones. This is actually a moment where she's having an external one. - Hey guys. - Ali! - Ali, nice to see you! - You, too. Where have you been, man? I got a thing to do. Well, I have some news for you. I've started working at Tuncay's travel agency today. - How? - I'll be selling tours from now on. So you quit acting altogether? Why did you do something like this? Well, I had to. I don't know, you gave up too soon. Really. Too soon. You're an amazing actor, you really are! Why don't you say something as well? Am I the only one left? There are tons of actors out there. How many actors, looking like me, actually make a living? Come on, don't be all sad like this. Let's take a selfie here one the last time. What do you mean, one last time? Well, I'm working now, I won't be able to come here that often. I'll stand here, between you guys. - Come. - You get closer, too. I'll send them to you guys, have a good one. Thanks, take care of yourself. Good morning. Good morning. - Did you have breakfast? - No, I didn't have the time. Good. I can sell you these, then. That's great, thanks. How much? Don't be ridiculous, eat it. I feel like I'm still sleeping. I'm not used to waking up this early. You'll get used to it. You know, the boss also did you a favor. Asia is new so there is not much interest for it yet. But with Spain-Portugal, you'll get lots of bonuses. Is that so? Yeah, I used to have that area before. After you came, the boss moved me to Asia. Oh, sorry. No worries, I got this. What did you do? Did you study for your tour? Well... Come, I'll help you out a little. Look, this is our tour programme. Usually, it's this one, make sure you memorize it. People will come here, you'll persuade them into purchasing the tour. It's not enough for you to get bonuses, though. What's important is the wholesale part. For that, surf the net. You can write comments on travel websites. Also… There's this option of premium service. The option of creating one's own tour, a VIP tour. The real money's here but Mr. Tuncay deals with that himself. Anything you don't understand? No, well... If I worked this hard for our play, I wouldn't be here now. - What do you mean? - I was an actor. Oh, yeah right. You were an actor. What is it like? Being an actor? Who can you impersonate? Impersonate? Acting isn't exactly something like that. It's more like… Ali, can you come here for a second, please? I'm coming, Mr. Tuncay. Yeah, I saw that. Are these two missing? How can they get lost like that in China? How are we supposed to find them? Yeah, reach them out someway, then get back to me, okay? Okay, have a good one. Ali, you look so chic! By the way, I informed the accounting. You can have half of your salary today. Just leave your account number before you go. - Thank you so much. - How's it going? Good, I mean I'm getting used to it, studying and all that. Nice. Ali, let me ask you something. What kind of a person is Ceren? - He decided way too early. - Looks like he'd be happy like that. We can't really do anything. I want to ask you something. Is he in love with you? Nonsense. Why do you think that? Do you know something I don't? I don't know anything. I am just asking. Nothing else. Do you feel something for him? Burak, why do you keep saying that? Is it because I'm sad? We've been friends forever. We've been performing together for so long. Of course, I'm sad! What's wrong with that? Nothing, Ceren. I'm only asking. Don't overreact. Fine. That's it, hold onto that, I expect to see this emotion. I want you to act like this at the start of the 2nd act. What kind of an emotion is that? The way you said, 'fine'. I want that from you. By the way, if you think you can't be in a relationship just because you're old friends or performing together. Don't think like that. Because you can. There are many in our community. No one'd condemn you. I wouldn't, for instance. We don't. That's it, hold onto that emotion right there. The way you cry out, 'we don't'. That defiance. I want that. Okay then, back on the stage. Get up. I want award-winning performance. - Bro, look at these, thank you. - Bon appetit, I got half of my salary. It's obvious. Look, half of the salary is here. I guess, you're happy with your job. He just started working there. I'm great, yeah. Really, I'm good. - And your play? How's it? - Very good. - For real? - Yeah. It's going great, he did a great job. You didn't read the script. I want it to be a surprise. I prefer to see it on stage. What's wrong Ceren, is there a problem? She feels sorry for you. - I'm okay. Really, I'm doing great. - I told her the same. Didn't I, Ceren? - I really feel great. - So, you're really okay? I'm okay, really, I'm great. Right now, I'm working with the Spanish tours. It has a large customer base. So it looks like I'll earn a good amount. I'd like to go to Southern France because Cannes is there, right? I've always wanted to see Spain since I was a little girl. I hope we can go there together someday. I mean Burak, you, me... together. Tuncay asked me about you the other day. He's been asking me out to dinner for a long time now. And I've been putting it off. Honey, don't, please. It's not right, he's our sponsor. I fear something will happen before the play. What are you saying? If she doesn't want to go, leave her be. It's not like that, she's just... Don't confuse her, Ali! I'm not doing anything. She's an adult. If she doesn't want to, she shouldn't. She doesn't say that. She's just embarrassed for putting it off many times. - What does 'putting it off' mean? - What does it mean? What it means... Listen to me. She means, she put it off because she doesn't want to have dinner with him. No, man. She means, she put it off many times and she doesn't want to anymore because of how bad it feels. - She puts it off but she doesn't want to! - I don't think so. Okay, wait a second. Well, I put it off too many times so I feel bad about it. See, that's what she says. Alright, then. It's because you said you put it off, I thought... - If you want to, of course, you should go. - He's a great guy but... you know. Yeah, I... You know after starting to work with him, I got the chance to observe him better. You didn't eat any pastrami, why? He ate it all. Why didn't you eat any? Go on, have some as well. Okay, I'll have a taste. Ceren, can you pass me the peanut butter? - Apparently I ate too much pastrami. - It's good. - Thank you. - Bon appetit. Ali, I wanted to ask you something. - Are you still in touch with Ceren? - Yes, I am. Can you please speak highly of me the next time you see her? Can you do it? Is it okay? - I've already done it. - Oh, do you? Like what? - I tell her good things about you. - Like what? Good things like... I say that you're hardworking, organized, you know. Positive things like that. I told her things like that, yeah. Thank you. So, how's work? I did get used to it but waking up early is so hard for me. That's a bit hard indeed yet it is what it is, you know? Early bird catches the worm. How's it going with the group sales? - I got that, yeah, no worries. - That's important, very important. Good. Have a good one, good luck. A great day awaits us today because we'll visit one of the places, I'm dying to see. La Sagrada Familia. Yes, after a 15-20 minute walk Gaudi's work salutes us with all of its magnificence. This work is fantastic, it's as if Gaudi's soul still resides here. Spain is an amazing country, absolutely fantastic. In Spain, the programme is like this. We start from Catalonia, Barcelona. There, Sagrada Familia, the church. - It's still under construction, right? - Yes, but not for long. - Maybe seeing it after that'd be better? - I'd say go see it before it's done. You never know what can happen. You know, these restoration stories don't always have a happy ending. I'd prefer you to see it before it's done. Gaudi's fantastic work, I mean, really... The moment you set your foot inside, it's as if Gaudi's soul is still there. Well, our friends were insistent on us seeing Italy. Yeah, people usually do that but it's wrong. I mean, as I've seen 90% of Europe. I can say that Italy is overrated. - We've always had this Venice dream. - Yes. No. It's just marketing. The water there is dirty, it stinks. The gondoliers, they are so rude, we get a lot of complaints about them. We've been actually thinking of taking it off the program, the gondola thing. Rome is amazing but two days wouldn't be enough for Rome. Our Rome tour is only two days long. So go see Rome another time. I mean, we looked things up online as well. - What do you say? - We've been thinking about Spain and... The gentleman here says it's good as well. I say, it's fantastic. Well, then... if there's a tour in mid-July, we'd like that. Let me check... July is usually a busy period. My time off from work is in July. Okay, shall we set the date for the 17th of July? - Yeah, that's good. - It's okay, right? - We were also thinking of that week. - Yeah, 17th is fine, let's take it. Okay, then. I'm booking it. Congratulations then. Have a great trip. Thank you. If there are any problems, you can always contact me. - By credit card? - Yes. Our friend there will help you. - What do we say then? - What? Adios amigos! Thank you. By the way, Andalusia will be around 50 degrees in July. Such a wrong choice. They'll wear hats. - Ali, do you have a Schengen visa? - No. I've never been abroad. Never? So, no passport as well? Well, let's get you a passport and a visa, and then we send you to Spain. - It'd be better for you to go and see. - Thank you, sir. You're welcome. Ali! We're going out to dinner with Ceren tonight. Is that so? The second date is a very important one. You'd know what likes. Which flower should I get for her? She loves cactus. American or African? Well, the usual one. You know, a cactus. - With thorns. - Cactus with thorns, okay. What is the one place that she'd love to see, a country or maybe a city? Japan. She loves Japan, she said she adores Japan. Japan... What is that she loves most about it? Tokyo, Kyoto... She says, she loves the urbanization there... The people, but most of all because it is an island. Oh, okay. Thanks. Japan, Kyoto, cactus... Have a good day, everyone! Hey, would you grab a cup of coffee after work? I hope, we can eat fish like this in Tokyo one day. Tokyo? Yeah. Tokyo, Japan. One of my favorite places. Urbanization, the people... Tokyo, Kyoto... You know, it's an island country. Sea all around. Yes. Ceren, I've been meaning to ask you a question. Well, of course. Will you marry me? Oh, you're serious. I wasn't expecting this. It was so sudden, I was surprised. You weren't expecting it, as well. Because there's no ring! Yes. I wanted ask you the question first. I mean, later. Someday in the future... I wondered, if you'd marry me. Will you and I marry, you know... later. - Some day? - Some day. Sorry, I couldn't write back before. I just came home. Why, what happened? I was at dinner with Tuncay. He proposed. What did you say? What could I say? I was too stunned to speak. For the premiere, Burak invited members of the Afife Jale jury. Almost there. He's determined to get you the award. The play turned out to be very good. We're very happy with it but it's hard. You never know. Good night, I'll wake up early tomorrow. Good night, take it easy. I LOVE YOU, WOMAN - Ali, how nice to see you. - You, too. My favorite flowers. Thank you. "GOOD LUCK" TUNCAY Are you ready? I am extremely nervous. Everything's going to be great, it's packed out there. Really? Yeah, I've never seen that many people in this hall. Burak said, he'd work hard, but I didn't believe him. I guess, he really did. I told the people at the office but they couldn't come because they were busy. - I'll bring them someday. - No worries, they'll come later. - I'll get to my seat, then. - Okay, see you after the play. Ali! I'm so glad to have you. They took everything from me. I've got no one left. Not a family or a friend. They said, I was alone from now on. I was already alone. But I won't stand down anymore! I won't tell my stories or sing my songs to the honourless, the coward, and the heartless! My heart is beating. That means I'm still alive. Then I'm really going to live this time. Because I love… I love you, woman. We'd like to meet with Ceren as well. There's a journalist who wants to do an interview. Okay, let's do it like this. Ceren is greeting people right now. I'll take her and we'll come together, is that alright? - Alright, good night. - Good night. Who's this woman? The Feminist Society President, Ms. Mehtap. Do you see that gentleman over there? He's the president of the LGBTQ+ Society. - Burak? - Tuncay! - Congratulations. - Thank you. Did you like it? I loved it. I mean, your plays are always great. Well, with Ceren in it, they are just spectacular. So, what are you doing tonight? Do you have any plans? Nothing planned yet, to be honest. I'll make the plans then. There's a fish restaurant I know. - Tonight's going to be legendary. - Okay. Okay, see you then. Ali, I'm going to go and see Ceren. We'll go to this interview, okay? Can you give me the numbers of these society people? - Okay, I will. Is it urgent? - No, whenever you can. Okay, see you. 3 MONTHS LATER You have a job now, so check out this girl. She's the teacher I was telling you about. What is it, man? Nothing, we just wanted to come over, is that bad? Ali! - We have such exciting news for you. - Come on guys, come here. - What is it? - Come and we'll tell you. - What is it? - Sit down, we'll tell you. - Yes? - This woman standing right next to me is an Afife nominee for the best actress at tomorrow's award ceremony. Did you get a nomination? She already did, the ceremony is tomorrow. Why didn't you tell me sooner? We wanted to wait for the ceremony day. What a surprise, right? Congratulations, I'm very happy for you. I always knew you deserved it. I know you're not an open box. But how did he keep a secret? I tried so hard to keep it in, man. But what did I tell you? We were all here. Didn't I tell you I'd get her a Afife Jale award? - We didn't win it yet, stop it. - Whatever, we're almost there. Let me tell you, by the way, you are invited for tomorrow. - When? - At 8 pm. I can't come. Why not? I can't. I'm flying to Spain tomorrow at 23:30. - I can't make it. - Oh no, man. I wish we'd have told you sooner. - You'd have arranged it then, right? - Of course, I would. Will you be working tomorrow? I have the day off. I left the dress I'll be wearing tomorrow to that tailor around the corner. We'll head to the theater tomorrow after we pick up the dress to rehearse my speech, if I win. Can you come there, at least? I'll come there, of course, it's just... I wish you'd have told me sooner. How could we possibly know that you'd go to Spain? We just wanted to surprise you.
