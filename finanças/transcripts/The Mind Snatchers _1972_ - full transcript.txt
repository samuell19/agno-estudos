(monkey chirping) (soft bell music) (people chattering) (upbeat music) (gift thuds) - Happy birthday. - Hey, Reese. - Guess you forgot to invite me. - But when did you get out of the stockade? - Just now. - But Gary told me you wouldn't be out until next week. - Really? - Hi, Reese. How did you get out, man? - Now, wait a minute, Reese. (people chattering and laughing) - Oh my god, is that you Linda Dodd? Sitting there, pretend you don't know me? Come on. Dance with me, you woman, you. I'll teach you the secret of the universe. - Reese, you are a pig. - Severe tongue-lashing. That's what that woman needs. - Okay, that's enough, buddy. You just hold it right there. - Who are you? What are you doing in my house? - Come on, let's go. - Let's forget it. I want my coat, and then get out of here. - Wiedersehen. Wiedersehen. Wiedersehen. Wiedersehen. Don't you think this is enough? - Forget it. - If I were you for a moment- - But you're not me. - I don't understand how you can stand it. - No, but don't you understand it I don't... - I don't care if you're a girl. I'll punch you right in the mouth. - Oh, please. Will you stop it? - Get up. - Don't pay any attention to him. Come on, Hildegard. Peter's waiting for you. - Sometimes I wish I understood you, Reese. - Why? - Because I want to help you. - I don't need help. - Yes, you do. - What? - You do need help, Reese. The way you act, the way you treated anybody, it wasn't normal. - I don't know. You know, you get born, you grow up, you go to school or you go in the army. And if you're not killed, you raise a family. The kids leave you as fast as they can. And then you're alone. And then two weeks before you retire you die. I don't want that. What I am, you know, it's not so good, but it's not so bad, either. - I won't let you alone, Reese. - Sweet. (knocking) - Private James H. Reese? - Mm-hmm. - Did some girl get hurt here tonight? - Is that what she said? - Get into uniform, soldier. You're wanted out at the base for questioning. - Look, you've come at a very bad time. See, I'm inside with a young lady. - I don't care if you're in bed with a four-star general. Let's go. - I can't come with you now. Don't put your hands on me! - Come on! Let's go! (man yelling) - You must be in a great deal of pain. - Oh, no, sir. I don't believe in pain. On moral grounds. - Oh, yeah. Is that right? Well, what's your moral position on being arrested, smart ass? - Couldn't we keep this conversation on a more personal level? - Shut up. Sign these papers. - Look, I'm a simple man. I have simple wants. Just put me in a cast, throw me in a sling. - Nobody's gonna set your arm until you're officially admitted, so sign, troop. - You know, you're kind of cute when you're pissed off. - Sign. With your record of arrests, you've run out of choices. Sign. - And so, Mr. Reese, you say you plan to stay up all night. - Oh, yes. I stay up every night. I pray. - What for? - I pray for the sun to rise. It's my belief that if I didn't pray all night the sun wouldn't come up. I don't do this for myself, you see. I do this for everyone. And it's a fact that every time I pray all night the sun comes up. - How long have you done th is, um, nightly ritual? - I used to do it just once in a while to keep in shape, you know but it's a family thing. And now that I'm the only one left, the torch, as it were, has fallen to me and so I must do it every night. Unless, of course, my eldest son, if I should ever one, will take over. - Hello. - Hello. - How are you? - Just fine. - But your arm. - I think that MP wanted to take it home with him. A souvenir of our lovely evening together. - Tell me, Reese, what kind of place is this? Is it a hospital or is it a prison? - Oh, it's a wonderful place. They take your x-rays, they put you in your cast on the first floor. And they take you to the second floor, with this weird man says things like aggravated assault. Then they bring you up here. They incarcerate you. And they throw away the key. - Have you seen all the silly men out there? Pretending they know who you are? I mean, they think you're, they think you're mad. They think you're a criminal. It's just like Hildegard. They think you, you hit her, and you won't tell the truth. - Yeah, okay. I'll clear it all up first thing. - [Lisa] I know you won't. I'm serious, Reese. - Don't be. It doesn't become you. And it's boring. Boring. - [Lisa] I think you're just unhappy. I was attracted by that for a while, but I don't know anymore. - [Reese] Lisa, you remember that man we saw in Frankfurt? The mentally retarded man who just kept smiling while everybody around him was screaming? - Yeah. - Well, he was happy. (Lisa sighs) - [Lisa] He was sick. (player clicks) (man grunts) - It's hard to tell after this sort of undirected conversation. Sounds articulate, reasonably complex. His record of arrests certainly adds an interesting note to the proceedings. All in all, I'd say he sounded promising. I'd like to investigate him further, if I might. - Certainly. - I think you have found an excellent candidate in this Reese fellow. He's been a constant offender. Quite obviously sociopathic, wouldn't you say? Yes, and incipient signs of schizophrenia, as well. There's no doubt in my mind. He fits your profile exactly. - Well, this sure is a nice car. They make you guy walk a beat before they give you a nice car like this? You know, I used to want to be an MP. When I was six. You guys keep order, you arrest people. You bring the guilty to justice. That's a hell of a thing, bringing the guilty to justice. I wish I was an MP. Jeez, I hate to bitch, but it's awful lonesome here in the back seat. I don't suppose I could climb up front with you fellas? No? I didn't think so. Well, it's better than being in the trunk, right? Right? Oh, yeah. Right. (upbeat music) Whoops. You made a wrong turn, there, MP. That's not the way to the stockade. You are taking me to the stockade, aren't you? Hi, there. Harvey Corman's the name. I represent the Mutual Beneficial Insurance Company, Incorporated. You're a family man. You're probably asking yourself, if a werewolf bit me, would my wife be properly taken care of? Bye. Can we stop the car? I have to go wee-wee. Whoops. Never mind. You know, I really enjoy talking to you like this. - Delivering James H. Reese. - Okay, Reese. Out. Name's Shannon. Corporal Lawrence Shannon. I'm head orderly here. - Where's here? - Okay, Reese. In here. Checking in Private Reese. Hey, Reese. Over here. - [Reese] It's a nice setup you have here. - Show Private Reese to the ward. - Okay, Reese. This way. - Nurse? Excuse me, nurse? Would you mind telling me where I am? - Certainly. You're standing four feet in front of me, flagrantly disobeying my order that you go to the ward. - Thank you. I was wondering where I was. - Hey, Reese. This way. (man screaming) - What's that? (man groaning) What's this place? - Look, just stay cool and don't make waves. You should keep something in mind, buddy. You cause trouble here, I can mess you up real good. - Does he always scream like that? - Only when he's awake. (upbeat music) Okay, Reese. Lieutenant Rhodes. Hey, Rhodes. Private Reese. - How do you do? - Reese. Sergeant Miles. - Hello. - Bathroom's the back door there. - Okay. - That's your bed there. - Okay. - Now get undressed. The nurse will be down to take your temperature and do all those things that nurses do. - Sure. Right away. I just want to relax a minute, you know? Accustom myself to my new surroundings. (Shannon laughing) - That's an order. I don't want Nurse Schroeder on my back, so you get undressed. - Right. - Okay? - Right. (Rhodes screaming) - Why don't they give him something? - Well, it ain't time yet. Hell, he ain't due for another jolt for oh, about an hour from now. Plays hell with the TV. Hey. Hey, listen. You want me to give you a hand getting undressed or something? - No. Thank you. (Miles chuckles) - Yes, sir. Will be good to have someone to talk to for a change. Old Tommy there, he ain't much of a conversationalist anymore. - Neither am I. - Oh, well. You'll get used to that once the shock wears off. When they first sprung it on me, hell, I didn't say a word to nobody for a solid week. Too busy drinking and screwing. (laughing) - [Reese] What shock is that? - Oh, you know. When they first tell you you're a corpse. Dead man. - All I got is a broken arm. - You had your complete physical yet? - Mm-hm. - Uh-huh. And what doctor did they assign you? - Frederick. (Miles laughing) - Well, that's our doctor, too, buddy-boy. Me and old Tommy. Yeah. You see, Tommy's got a hole about this big in his intestines. And I can guess to the month I ain't gonna have any lungs left. Yeah. Yeah. Used to be a fella in here looked a lot like you. Came in with his leg in a cast. Croaked of leukemia. Not a bad way to go. Not as bad as Tommy's. - How come his head is bandaged? You said he got it in the intestines. I have intestines up in my head? (Miles laughing) - Hey, that's pretty good! Hey, Tommy, you been peeing out your ear lately? (laughing) hey, I used to know a couple of girls like that. - So how come his head is bandaged? - I don't know. Go ask Doc Frederick. (Rhodes screaming) Relax. That's just his hour tone. About half past we get two quick screams. Yeah. This place is a lot of laughs. And there's only one way out. - I doubt that. I doubt that. (TV clicks off) - Hey. Why'd you do that? - You weren't watching it. - Okay, Reese. Suit yourself. (TV clicks on) (TV clicks off) Yeah. You see, when old Tommy ain't screaming, there just ain't no place in the world more quiet than this room. - You really know how to turn a phrase, don't you? How long you been here? - Who counts? I'm more interested in how long I got left. - Place gives me the creeps. - Oh, relax, boy. - Why can't we have a private room? This place is big enough. - Ha. Privacy's the last thing you want, kid. - Hey, would you knock if off with kid? And I don't need your parental advice. - Now, you better keep your head, sonny. - Look, for both our sake, just shut up. Okay? Throw me in a crypt like this. Excuse me. - Hell, you've got the wrong attitude, Reese. You know that? We're the elite. We get all kind of preferential treatment. Baby, we're showpieces. And speaking of pieces, Reese, wait'll you get a load of this little Red Cross girl comes around to play checkers with me. She's got the hots for my body. (laughing) (Rhodes screaming) - Orderly. Hey, orderly! - Someday, Reese. Someday me and that little old Red Cross girl gonna do a hell of a lot more than play checkers, I guaran-damn-tee you. (laughing) - Can't you give him a shot? - Can't do it for another 45 minutes. Why haven't you men been drinking your pink lemonade? - Screw the pink lemonade. - Think I cart this around for my health? - I ain't drinking anymore of that piss. - Drink it and beg for more. - [Reese] Hey, that's for fever. - Hey, don't you give me a hard time too, chief. - That's my boy. Yes siree, 18 years of med school. Bet it was worth it. Because now he makes the best freaking pink lemonade on the block. (Rhodes screaming) - Hey, give him his shot, you creep. - He ain't due yet. - Give him his shot, you bastard. - Got another 45 minutes. - Get the nurse. A nurse to give him his injection. - Doctor, he's not ready- - Get the nurse to give him his injection. When he's fully under, I want her to move him to carefully to room D, understood? - Right. Room D. - How's it going, Miles? - Oh, still kicking, Doc. Hey, you know, I'm up to four packs a day. I'd trade all the peanuts in the world for one taste of the old hair of the dog that bit me. - You and me, son. (Miles laughing) - Well, hell, Doc, even a condemned man's entitled to one last smoke. - Say, I, I hate to break this up but when you have a minute. - What is it you want, Reese? - How about some information. Am I dying? - You have a broken arm. - Yeah, I know that. But am I gonna die from it? - No, you're not. - Then why am I here? - Yeah. Why is he here, the snotty son of a bitch? - And why can't I have a private room? - Oh, you could do with a little company. - You call this company? - Oh, it's what you make it. - How long am I gonna be here? - Reese, we'll have a chat about it later, but right now, I have things to do. Excuse me. - Hey, wait a minute. Did you see that? See how he ducked out of here? There's something funny about guy. I sensed it. I sensed it right from the start. - Boy, you don't take much to anybody, do you? - Go eat your peanuts, lifer. - Hey, you wanna know something, boy? I'm about ready to ram that cast halfway up your ass. - Okay, Miles. Let's just drop it, Okay? - Say, I'll bet you're a college boy, ain't you? - I went there. - What'd you used to study? - English. (Miles laughing) - English! (laughing) Hey. Where you going? Hey! (soft eerie music) (door closes) (monkey screeching) (monkeys chirping) Oh, shit! Come on! Come on! - What are you doing? - Oh. That's it, baby. Oh. Oh, Jesus. Oh. Come here. Come here! Look. Look on the ledge. Just down past there. You see her? You see her? - No, I can't see her. - Oh, gimme that! Oh. Shit. She turned the light out. - Try not to think about it. Take a cold shower. - Hey, where you been? - Nowhere. Absolutely nowhere. - Dr. Frederick, Congresswoman Johnson. - It's a pleasure. - And of course, Congressman Weston whose committee has been very generous with funds for our project. - Doctor. I, um, I'm over here because I've heard rumors that there have been setbacks. - Well, I hesitate to doubt the source of your rumors, but I can assure you, as army observer and coordinator of this project, each step Dr. Frederick and his staff, and, I modestly admit, myself, have taken, each step has been a forward one. - [Weston] Doctor, when can we expect to be able to present your findings to Congress? - I'm a scientist, Mr. Weston, not a long-distance runner. - How soon, Doctor? - You know, I'll bet this place was really something to see in the old days, huh? - Yeah. What is this place? - Well, the way I get it from Shannon, that's the punk orderly, this place used to belong to a big German field marshal. You know, bachelor kind of guy, the army had always been his whole life, so when he died he left the army his mansion. Now the army's got it. - How many patients they got here? - Oh, let's see. Now, this is just a rough estimate, you understand. But I'd say three. - Three? - Yeah. You, me, and Tommy. So to be really accurate you'd have to say, uh, two and a half 'cause, you see, Tommy ain't half the man he used to be. (Miles laughing) He ain't half the man he used to be! Well, that struck me kinda funny, you know? You know, it's weird, Reese. Nowadays the damndest things just tear me up. Hey. Ain't right, is it? I mean, in my condition. You ever laugh much? - No. No. - I didn't think so, somehow. Why? Well, you sure as hell shrug a lot. I bet that old cast kind of cramps your whole style, doesn't it? (laughing) Hey, that's pretty good. Hey, uh, you got any brothers and sisters? - [Reese] I don't know. - [Miles] You don't know if you got any brothers or sisters, huh, college boy? - What do you care? - Well, now that you mention it, I don't give a damn one way or the other. I was just trying to make a little conversation, you know? Now where you going? Hey, those woods are off-limits. (upbeat music) (dog barking) Hey, Reese. Don't turn your back on him. I've seen those dogs work before. Just, uh, back up slowly. Talk to him. - Ooh. Good dog. (dog barking) That's a dog. - Looks kind of like Shannon, doesn't he? Easy. Nice. - Nice. - Why don't we go back in? - Whoa dog. - Easy, easy. (dog growling) (dog barking) (Miles exhaling deeply) You should have seen your face. - What do you mean? I wasn't scared. Come on, dog. Let's go. I'll punch you in the face. I ain't scared. Hey, wait a minute. What's with the fence and the dogs? - Well, they don't want anyone to break in here, do they? - Break in? Miles, did you notice the barbed wire up on top of that fence? On the brackets? Pointing in, like this. - Yeah. - Well, if they wanted to keep people out, it'd point out. And the dog, they patrol the area, but the inside area? What is this place? Auschwitz? (people chattering) - At ease, men. These are two of our patients. Sergeant Boford Miles, Private James Reese. - Hello, men. How is life treating you? - Oh... - No complaints? - No. - Well, that's the first time I've ever heard of soldiers without any complaints. - Well, we make it our business to keep our patients as happy and comfortable as possible. - I'd like to ask you a question. What about the- - Uh, we'll have plenty of time for that later. We've got a lot of ground to cover now. - We'll talk after dinner. - You see that guy? He ducked out on me again. - What do you got against Frederick? I like him. - I don't know, Miles. I got a thing about that man. - Well, he ain't just no, uh, pill doctor, you know. He's some kinda shrink, too. - Yeah. He's some kinda creep, too. - Well let me tell you something, buddy boy. He knows a lot about brains, I'll tell you that. Yeah. Hey, you take old Tommy, for instance. One day Frederick co mes into the ward. And Tommy's hurt, I mean, he is really hurt. So Frederick takes him by his hand, you know? Kind of like he's a woman. And he says to Tommy, he says, "Would you like me to make it stop hurting?" And Tommy sort of sniffles. Said he'd appreciate it, you know? So the doctor says, "The hurt's in your head, Tommy. Not your stomach." And old Tommy just says, "Yes, sir." Just like that. And me, I said, "Doc, are you ever full of shit." But not Tommy. Then, you see, I figured it. He's gonna hypnotize him or something like that. - But he didn't, did he? He opened his head. - Sort of looks that way, don't it? (chuckles) - Miles, I want to ask you a question. - [Miles] I'm trying to line up a shot. Do you mind? - I want to ask you about Rhodes. - What? - You're pretty good friends with him, right? - Yeah. Excuse me. - Well, has he acted any differently since they worked on his head? - Can't say that I noticed. He seems to hurt about as bad as ever. - Did Frederick say anything more about what he'd done to him? - No. - Come on, man. Think. He say anything about removing pressure on his brain, anything like that? - Now, why is he gonna say anything to me? Think I'm gonna understand what he's talking about? - Probably not. - Well, I ain't so goddamn sure you would, either. Yeah! Yeah. - Don't push me. - That's why you're afraid of him. Old guys like you, you don't worry about getting beat up or nothing like that. No, you can talk your way out of most spots. But let someone come on who's got a few more smarts than you and you goddamn near have kittens. While me, I don't worry about looking dumb. Okay. Okay. Maybe I don't have no college education or nothing like that, but let me tell you something, son. I went to the toughest school of all. I went to- - The school of hard knocks, right? Out from the teeming tenements. Yeah, didn't we all? - Eh. - Listen, Miles, it's okay if you don't like me. - Oh, well, wipe my ass. Boy, you really are something, aren't you? - But we don't have much in common, do we? Except maybe Frederick. - What is this thing you know about Frederick? - Use your head, Boford. I don't trust the man. - Well, I do, old buddy. - Enough to trust him with your life? Old buddy. - Oh. You know, when I was a kid, I used to someone like you. Yeah, yeah, this kid, if we ever got in a dark room, see, something like that, he'd always go real tense. And he would, "Hey, did you hear that?" And everybody else always supposed to listen up real close, you know? And say, "No, what?" The only thing was, see, this goddamn kid, he's always making the whole thing up. Gave him a big charge, you know, to hear things that weren't there. But I cured him of that. One day we was in this dark room, like always and he says, "Hey, did you hear that?" And I turn and I belt the crap out of him. No, I said. Do you feel that? - Okay, Miles. Okay. - Okay. Hey, Reese? Ask me if I'm married. Come on, come on, come on. Ask me if I'm married. - For God's sake. You're married? - Nah, I'm divorced. - How come? - She talked too much. - How long? - [Miles] How long what? - Have you been divorced? - Eight years! Ah. Think of something else. - You ever have any visitors? - Do I ever have any visitors? Uh. No. Just the Red Cross girl. I think they pay her to see me. No relatives, nothing like that. It's, uh, it's lonely here. Never thought I'd die lonely. Oh! What kind of bullshit am I spouting? You know what's wrong with me? I'm horny as a three-balled toad, that's what. Hoo-hoo-hoo! I need a woman. Any woman. I don't care if she's toothless and crippled and wearing a glass eye. I'll take her. Woo! (laughing) Sometimes I go a little crazy just thinking about it, you know? Oh! (laughing) I reckon not having a woman's about the worst thing in the whole world. Yeah. Except for one thing, you know? Silence. Not having someone to talk to. (Miles chuckles) You know, lately, I've caught myself talking to the TV. Silence ain't good for a goddamn thing. - They took Rhodes. - I got nobody. - That narrows it down to us, doesn't it? You. Me. And Frederick. - I thought we agreed on later? - What do you plan to do with me? - You must lead a very dull life, Private Reese, that you apparently have to weave mystery into it at every turn. - Well, for Christ's sake. I break my arm, they throw me in a ward with terminal cases. With guards and dogs. Barbed wire fence. They put in the charge of a brain doctor. That's what you are, isn't it? Does it take an overactive imagination for that to seem strange? Then there's Tommy Rhodes. Now, there's a man with a hole in his intestines. And that poor bastard's laying th ere with his dead taped up. Now, what am I supposed to make of that? - Those mysterious bandage represented nothing more than an experimental technique designed to stop pain at its source. Which was, of course, the brain. - I'll say it again, you said was? - Yes, I did. Rhodes died on the operating table 10 minutes ago. - How? How did he die? - Hm. - Did you kill him? Did you really take a dying man and put the finishing touch on him by fooling with his brain? - Let me to tell you something about Rhodes. That boy was coherent enough not only to understand that I was trying to ease his death, but that I could turn it into something meaningful. He knew that the same techniques that I applied to him could be used to spare others agony. That they might lead to a cure for many ills. Including schizophrenia. - Oh, you're wonderful. You're just wonderful. - You are a very small man, Mr. Reese. - And you're obviously some kind of colossus. So I'm sure you'll understand why I want to keep out from underfoot. In fact, if I had my way, I'd have me a doctor that didn't know shit about brains. - Benson! - Hey, buddy. You okay? (Miles exhales) - Yeah. - Who's Benson? - Remind me to tell you about her before I die. (Miles panting) (bell ringing) - Gently. - 8:00 already? - Morning. - You've been here all night, haven't you? Why don't you go and get some rest now? - Perfectly positioned. But I found information in the hydrothermic area I don't understand. - It hasn't changed. - Shh. - If the (indistinct) level is not in excess, it is well within the gradient limits... - Oh, really, doctor. I'm sure you haven't even eaten breakfast. - Those gradients are established for healthy patients. If you're the debilitation of the subject, isn't it possible- - You did everything you could. - Nevertheless, Rhodes is dead. - I'm well aware of that, Doctor, but I see no reason to dwell on it. - Aren't you at least interested in the cause of death? - He was all but clinically dead before we began. If he had lived, you might have been able to benefit him immensely. No. If we can be faulted for anything, it is simply that our choice of subject was injudicious. - Injudicious. - But we don't have that many to choose from. Where are all the schizophrenics the major promised you? After all, that is what we're here for, isn't it? - Is it? - There's Miles. - Oh, yes. Miles, at least, is still relatively healthy. - And Reese. - Mr. Miles. Well. My goodness. Where is everybody? Where's Tommy Rhodes? - Took him away. - Oh. They took him away. I see. And the incorrigible Mr. Miles? - Taking a crap. - Oh, then I shall see him shortly, I presume. And you are? - I'm in a foul mood and I don't want to play games. - Of course. Do you mind if I sit down very quietly and wait for Mr. Miles? You can't imagine how much he looks forward to his checkers. - Can't imagine what else he 's looking forward to. Well, sit down. Wait. I don't care. - Thank you. Uh, I've got some nice cookies here. - This is garbage. - Matter of taste. What do you like to read, Mr... - None of your business. - Well, I'm afraid you're mistaken there. It is precisely my business to know exactly what you like to read. And what sort of games you like to play, and what kind of cookies you're fond of eating. It's my business to make this room seem larger. - Are you fooling with me? - If I'm upsetting you, I could just go away for awhile and I could come back later to see Mr. Miles. - Good idea. - Did you just find out? - Find out what? I haven't found out anything. The longer I'm here, the less I find out. Look, Miss, uh, what? - Kraus. Miss Anna Kraus. Sometimes known as Florence Nightingale. Although I find that cliche increasingly tiresome. - Well, look, Florence, you gotta, you gotta distribute your professional sympathy more efficiently, you know? You can't waste it on me. - Your eyes are all puffy. Are you in pain? - Yes. I am. Right here. (Kraus laughing) I just insulted you. You're so stupid, you don't get it? Look, can you make babies? - Yes, of course I can. - Then why don't you go do that? - Hey, hey, hey. What's going on here? (Kraus sobbing) What's this punk doing to you, Anna? - Hey. What you doing out here? Got Miss Kraus in the ward today. - She depresses me. (Shannon laughing) - Aw, hey, now. No reason to be depressed. Not with me around. You just swallow this down. - What's the pill for? - Set your head right, baby. - I don't need any dope. - Go on, take it. Free trial offer. If you like, next time we do business. If not, well, it never happened. - What is that? - You don't know it. It's perfectly safe for babies and small dogs and things. Non-habit-forming. No harmful side effects. Ah. Never mind, Reese. I just thought I'd do you a favor. - No. Wait, wait a minute, huh? Will it, uh, will it calm me down? - Chief, not even God will scare you. - Why are you doing this? - Because I hate to see somebody eating his guts out the way you've been doing. Brings me down, you know? Besides, I have faith in the product. (Shannon laughing) Woo! (laughing) It'll make you happy and it'll make me happy. Eh? Now what do you want to talk to me about? Rhodes, right? - Rhodes. He's dead. - So? Last time you saw him, would you exactly call that being alive? - Wasn't so much what he said as his cynicism. Sneering at the very idea of people helping one another. Well, there's nothing funny about that, is there, Mr. Miles? Loving thy neighbor? - Oh, I reckon not, I mean, where would we be if we couldn't love one another? Yes, ma'am, I'm a firm believer in love. - It's my fault, really. When somebody tries to hurt me like that, so coldly and deliberately hurt me, I can see that he's really just trying to reach out. I can see that he hurts a lot worse on the inside, where you can't see it. - Yeah, the inside hurt. Oh, man. - What are you doing? Peter, this must be one of those days. Thank you very much, Mr. Miles, for listening to me but I've got to be going now. - No, you don't. - Well, unless you'd like to play some checkers. - Checkers and pink lemonade? I've had enough of that. You know what I need, Anna? I need love. - I know you do, poor man, but that's not in my contract. Now, please. - I'll be dead in a month. - Now don't say that. It's not true. - You know it is. And no one to grieve for me. - I'll grieve for you. I grieve for all of you. - But you'll just grieve for me as a dead patient. You won't grieve for me as a man. - I will. I promise. I will. - You'll make my last hours a little more comfortable, won't you, Anna? It's so lonely here. I'll treat you good. - I know, I know. - You want to. You know you do. - [Kraus] No, I don't. No, please don't. Please. Stop it. You don't love me! - Oh, but I do, Anna. I love you- - No, you don't! You don't love me, because I'm too fat! - Fat girls turn me on. - Oh, please! No! - Now you listen to me, you little bitch! There are two ways you can have it. Now, you can have it nice. Or you can have it nice and rough. Just take your pick, because me, I don't care. Now don't make me talk tough, okay? Okay. Okay, maybe I don't love you. But I like you. And that's the truth. Now, I'm not gonna hurt you. And don't be frightened. - Please, Mr. Miles. - God dammit! - Please, Mr. Miles! Please! Please, Mr. Miles! - My ass! - Please, Mr. Miles! Please don't! Help! - Gonna need a little privacy. (Miles yelling) (Shannon laughing) - You don't have to tell me. I can sense the vibes. Pill's working. - Dynamite! (Shannon laughing) - Better living through chemistry. (laughing) I learned that in Nam. When my 12 months were up I asked for a transfer here. - And you brought your little medicine bag along. - You said it. Play the game. Smile at the big boys, an d keep out of trouble. - That sounds easy. - If you wised up, you'd have it better. Now believe me, buddy, I'm as hot-headed as you are, but I've learned don't swim upstream. - What? - Ah. I gotta get back to the ward. I'm not supposed to leave Miles alone too long. Frederick wants me to kind of keep an eye on him. - Oh, no. No, no, no, man. You don't want to do that. You don't want to watch Miles this afternoon. He needs a little privacy. You know. Just him and Ms. Kraus. - Who needs privacy when they play checkers? - Come on, Shannon, give him a break. She's been hot after Miles for months now. Today he's finally gonna give in. - Jeez. That pill must be stronger than I taught. Hey, Kraus ain't never been hot for anything in her whole life. - No, no, man. Miles told me. She makes passes at him all the time. - Ah. - That's right. - Yeah, you better check your reality testing mechanism, kid, because poor old Ms. Kraus ain't never made a pass at anything, period! She's a terminal virgin! If Miles had made a pass at her, she'd crack like an old pipe! There'd be pieces of her mixed all over the ward with the checkers. And if Miles ever messes with her, there'll be pieces of him all over the ward, too. You understand? - I was only kidding. What's the matter? Can't you take a joke? - Hey, Reese, where you going? Hey Reese! Miles! All right, where is she? - Who? - Anna. - Oh. She left. What are you staring at? - Women just can't resist you, can they? - Not for long. - I should say not. Well, you're more than a match for your little Red Cross worker, aren't you? - What are you gonna do about it? - I haven't decided yet. What do you think she's gonna do? - Nothing. - [Reese] Just forget about it? Just like that? - Yeah. What else she gonna do? She'd be too embarrassed to tell anybody about it. - [Reese] Did you hurt her? - I don't know. I forgot to ask. - [Reese] Do you think she'll be back? - Who, Anna? Who cares? - That the first girl you ever raped? - Now, look. Knock off about it, will ya? It's over and done with. - What's it like? The more exciting if she consent? - Look, god dammit, I asked you real nice to drop the subject. I ain't gonna ask you again. - Chained? - Now you better shut up. - You're a coward! A stupid coward! You're a stupid, gutless coward! Let me go you... One arm, one arm, you stupid coward! Let me up! Coward! You stupid coward! (Miles retching) Miles? What's the matter, Miles? (ominous music) (Miles coughing) Shannon! Shannon! Shannon! - Get Frederick. Find Frederick! Get Frederick here! Kind of a red-letter day to you, isn't it, Miles? - Oh. - Bet you wondered plenty of times why we had you here, huh? Bet you had yourself all psyched into thinking everybody was making a big mistake, didn't you? Huh? (Shannon laughing) - How long? - [Frederick] With extensive surgical care, proper application of certain drugs, maybe half a year. - Yeah, well, if you just sat back and didn't mess with me, how long? - Well, what can I say? Maybe a couple of months. Do you feel we have misled you in any way? Encouraged you to build false hopes, because if so- - No, no, no, no. (Miles sighs) So, I lay around, let you squeeze a few more days out of my hide. Is that it? - That's putting it rather boldly. - That's it just the same, huh? Beautiful. Just beautiful. Well, I ain't going like Tommy Rhodes, you hear? I ain't going out whimpering and screaming and begging for medicine, pleading for shots from that punk orderly. - There's an alternative. I'm engaged in a project of some significance. You can help, if you like. This is a piece of 31 gauge Teflon stainless steel wire. I want to put it in your brain. - Oh. (chuckles) Wow. I gotta admit, Doc, the whole thing sounds pretty wild, but, uh, digging around inside my head, uh-uh. No. - It might help with Benson. - Who told you about that? Nobody knows about that. Nobody. - It might help you to sleep easier at night, Miles. And believe me, you're going to want all the sleep that you can get. Tell me about Benson. - Benson. Benson, Benson, Benson, Benson. - Tell me. - In the war, during the war... - He was your buddy? - Yes. No. No, he wasn't. I didn't like him very much. He was colored. But that ain't why I did it. That ain't it at all. It was instinct, almost. It wasn't me, hardly. - What did you do, Miles? - We was scrunched down in this shell crater sort of thing. Just a cut in the ground. And I looked over and he... I don't, I don't know what happened. I, I looked over in his direction. And I saw it. A grenade. A live grenade. I don't know what happened. It wasn't me that did it. - You pushed him. - Yeah. Yeah, I pushed him. He fell on top of it. And it, uh, blew him apart. I wasn't even scratched. When I made it back to the platoon, I, I told them about Benson. Only I didn't tell it the way it happened. I said that he jumped to save me. They gave him the Medal of Honor. - Miles, I'm giving you a way out. I'm giving you a chance to do one decent thing in your life. I can't stop you from dying. But I can give your death a little meaning. A little dignity. (drill whirring) - How could you do it? You knew about Tommy. Doesn't what happened to him worry you? - No. - No? Oh, Miles, don't you remember how you said you were gonna go? Mean and clean, like a man. Remember? Now you'll be going with a bunch of, bunch of strangers leaning over you, measuring your heart beat and your brain waves like you're some kind of 200 pound rat. Is that the way you want it? Talk to me, you son of a bitch. - Let me sleep. - No, I won't, I want you to wake up. I want you to listen to me. I won't let you lay around, jiggling your nuts for the rest of your life? Miles, don't you care about anything anymore? - No. - You don't want that, do you? - It's the same thing they're gonna do to you. Oh, you've known about it all along. Why else you been so shit-eyed scared? - I'm perfectly healthy. They can't take me. - They ain't gonna take, you jerk. You're gonna volunteer. (door creaks) (checkers rattling) - Uh, can't I finish the game? - [Shannon] Uh-uh. - You would have won again. - Hey, Miles. All you gotta do is say no. (ringer buzzing) - That's it. (ringer buzzing) That's all there is to it. (ringer buzzing) - Like that, huh? - Just like that. (ringer buzzing) - [Miles] It's kind of like a little toy. - No, no. No, not at all. - Oh, I mean, with the light and buzzer thing. It's like something I got for Christmas once when I was a kid. (chuckles) - The light and bell arrangement has nothing to do with the probe, as such. It is just an aid for me to record the experiment. And you mustn't worry about how long you press the buzzer. I have installed a special built-in cut-off device to prevent you from injury, you see? - Oh. Looks like you thought of everything. - Oh, yes. Yes, I think so. Well. - Well. Let's do it. - All right, Miles. Now, we start off with the feeder wire. Now, this is really just a great big extension cord. It is much more awkward than the radio control component, but, um, I trust it more. Just old-fashioned, I guess. - Yeah. - You said you're married, didn't you, Miles? - No, I'm divorced. - That's nice, that's nice. Look, uh, don't press that buzzer until I give you the word, all right? - Oh, no. - That's it. - Uh, hey, Doc? (machine whirring) Well, you're not gonna be doing any of this zapping yourself, are you? I mean, unless I push the button, nothing's gonna happen. Right? - Look, Miles. You have to push. You have to push the button yourself. I mean, if, if I press it the whole experiment doesn't make sense. But you knew that, didn't you, hmm? (Miles panting) - I'm sorry, Doc, it's just- - It's all right. - It's just that wire kind of psyched me out, that's all. I feel like a robot. (machine whirring) (machine whirring) Am I plugged in? (laughing) - Yes. You're plugged in. - Everything squared away? - Yes. Everything is squared away. (Miles breathing heavily) - Then stand back, baby. (chuckles) Don't fly 'til you see the whites of the thighs. (laughing) (ringer buzzing) Shall I push it again? - Yeah. Whenever you feel like it, Miles. (ringer buzzing) Miles. What do you feel? - Feels very funny. (ringer buzzing) - Have a seat, Miles. - Uh, uh, it's uh... Uh, it's like an itch, sort of. Yeah. Like an itch. Only it doesn't bother me at all, you know? It feels nice. (ringer buzzing) - Where does it itch, Miles? - All over. I, I can't pin it down. It's... It's like I'm in a glove. - In a glove? - Yeah. Big, fur-lined glove. (ringer buzzing) - Go on. Come on, Miles, come now. - I, uh... So warm. Yeah. I feel warm. (ringer buzzing) Oh, oh. It's hot. (ringer buzzing) (ringer buzzing) (Miles groaning) (Miles groaning) (Miles panting) - Miles. Is it what you expected? (Miles panting) Is it better, worse? - I don't know. It's just different. - Are you able to isolate the area with he strongest sensation? - Yeah. My crotch. But it was everywhere at once, you know? Oh, boy. I gotta think about this. - Miles, you seem a bit upset. - Yeah, well, look, Doc. I mean, there was an awful lot going on just now, you know? Why don't you just go away for a while? - Yes. Yes, of course. Go to sleep. We'll talk later. (door closes) - So you did that all by yourself, did you? (ringer buzzing) - What do you think of this new plate? - It looks all right. - It's too far anterior. I'm almost positive. - It looked all right on the earlier plates. How can you be sure that this one's right and others are wrong? - I can't. But he is living proof that something is wrong. - [Nurse] He's still refusing food. - [Frederick] And he hasn't had one minute's sleep since he stated pressing that button. - Where's Miles? - [Nurse] What do you think you're doing here? - Hello, Reese. Get him back to the ward. - What have you done with Miles? - I take you back to bed, Reese. Reese. - Reese. Go back to the ward. - Come with me. - Miles? - Reese, back. - Is that you, Miles? - Reese. Leave him alone. - Get away from me! (Frederick groaning) (buzzer ringing) Miles? Miles, it's... It's me. Reese. Miles. - Reese? I'm like a little baby. Change me and powder me. Christ have mercy. - Reese. (buzzer ringing) - What are you doing, Miles? (buzzer ringing) What are you doing? - Please. This won't help, Reese. - Where's the power? (Miles groaning) - Reese. Where are you going? - Don't do that. - Leave him! Leave him! Leave him! - I tell you once! I don't play with you! (buzzer ringing) Where's the power? Where's the power! (miles whimpering) - Miles! Go right back. (Miles screaming) (Frederick yelling) - Corporal, Corporal, over here! Take this man out of the ward! Get that son of a bitch back to the ward and see that nobody speaks to him. Nobody. And see that he doesn't step one foot out of that ward! (yelling) - [Miles] No. No. No. - It's all right, Miles. Go to sleep. Go to sleep. It's all over. - All right. Inside, private! You really put me on the spot, Reese. I don't like that. Try to be nice to somebody, give them a pill, some good advice. Huh? What do you get? Huh? Abuse! - Come on, Shannon, give me a break. I gotta get out of here. - Not a chance. I gotta look after myself. Besides, I warned you, didn't I? Huh? Don't swim upstream! - Come on, man. - You really lost it there with our Major, man. You don't understand. Man. It ain't that lousy doctor, he don't mean nothing! It's that Major! And you, he's gonna take me apart just because of you, you filthy, lousy creep! It's just a bar of soap, chief. Soap in a sock! Hurts like hell, don't it? (laughing) Of course, I only use it in self-defense. We get a lot of weirdos around here, you know? World could do with a whole lot less of them! - Shannon. They own you. How does it feel? - But at least I had a choice. That's more than I can say for you. (laughing) - Shannon. - Agh! - Was he finished? - Oh, yes. He's finished. - Beautiful. That does present a problem. - Beautiful? After 23 years studying one small portion of the human brain, nothing. Nothing. It'll workout somehow. (Shannon groaning) - Shannon? Are you all right? Major! Major! (dog barking) (dramatic music) - You're gonna have to listen to me, Doctor. - After Miles? - When our official friends learn about this fiasco they'll slice us to ribbons to save their asses. And the rest of the world is just looking for a story about the evils of modern technology so they'll feed us to them and you'll be the monster. - Let me... Let me think about this. We'll discuss it later. - [Major] Have you forgotten about your intuitive factory? - Reese? Are you mad? He despises me. - Well, you saw what he did. He's obviously psychotic. And you yourself have described him as hopelessly paranoid. - That suggestion is obscene. - Oh, come on, Doctor Why, you've been holding him in reserve ever since the ex periment stated. Go ahead, deny it if you can. - It's only because I thought he would volunteer. He's a perfect psychological (indistinct). I thought he would leap with it. - Well, a judge of human character you are not. - I will not take him against his wishes. - You won't have to. Face it, Doctor. You work more as a scientist than a scapegoat. - You work more as a colonel than as a major. - You're damn right. (laughing) I'd be the first colonel in the history of the United States Army with more brains than bullshit. All right, Doctor. Now how do we measure Reese? From what you say, right now he's not even any good to himself. But by tomorrow he could be the biggest breakthrough ever achieved in the treatment of mental illness. - Or dead. - Well, frankly, who'd miss him? - Who'd miss him? Who indeed. God help lonely people. (upbeat music) (dogs barking) (ominous music) (dogs barking) (men grunting) Major. Why don't you volunteer? (Major laughing) - You're serious. - Any volunteer is preferable to a conscript. - Well, I'll tell you what, Doctor. As soon as you get the bugs worked out, I'll be the first in line. We go with Reese. - If you get him to sign. - I'll see the appropriate papers immediately. (machine whirring) - Well. You must be very pleased. - What did you expect? You volunteered. - I didn't volunteer for anything. - The release form- - Mm-mm. - Your signature! - Sure you did, Reese. You signed the release along with all those other papers the night you were admitted with a broken arm. - Please. - You bastard. - You needed volunteers to work with, so I gave the general order that all patients admitted to the hospital with mentally disturbed backgrounds were to be given the necessary forms to fill out for release. It's simple as that and quite legal. - You bastard! - Oh, come on, Doc. The button, Reese. - Well, what do you say, doctor? You think you have the right to ask me to push this? - I'm sick of hearing about rights. I've been involved in every classic problem in medical morality and I'm tired. Today I go by only one rule. That is to cure those diseases that I cannot prevent. And that goes for diseases of the mind. - But I have nothing to cure, you know that. Miles... He's dying anyway. I'm not even sick. - You've jeopardized his life on two occasions. - I'm not a criminal, if that's what you're saying. - But you're violent. You're lonely, confused. Frightened. Thoroughly unhappy. - Oh, man. You don't like what you see, look the other way. Those things you just called me, they're conditions, states of being. They're not crimes or diseases. They're not sins. They're not even fixed in constant things inside me. You can't burn them away like warts. You don't just cut them out. - No, but you can override them. The way that certain drugs override pain. - But why? Because they're not pretty to look at? Because that side of reality makes people uncomfortable? Jesus, Doctor. I need those things. I don't love pain but it defines me. It's part of what I am. Who are you to come along and just erase that? - I'm not trying to justify our methods. How can I, when they are repugnant to me? But the fact is I can help you. - Come on. Let's get this over with. - The control system is such that he will respond half a mile away. - You gonna take this thing out of my head? You gotta be out of your mind, you know. You can't change me. You wouldn't know where to begin. I am James H. Reese. And you know what else I am? I am unique. - You're the brother to three billion men. Can you deny them a better formal existence? - Would you use it on your son? - I have no son. - That's not what you told Miles. - Then I was misconstrued. My son is dead. He was very like you in many respects. One day he walked into his room and shot himself through the head. - That's too bad. If he'd stuck around you might have brought him happiness. Piece of wire, spark of electricity. Bzzt. Peace. - Press the button. - I'm such a small man, Doctor. You do it. - Press the button. (Monkey chirping) - All right. Give me that. - Hold it. Not on your life, Hitler. That belongs to my good friend Dr. Frederick. He of the golden tongue. Go on, doctor. You made it. You play with it. Look, I'll all set to be sacrificed for the good of humanity. Why the hesitation? You afraid to get your hands dirty? Look at me. I know you. I see you. I know what's bothering you, mister. You're worried about my epitaph, aren't you? Well, shit, man that's the least I can do for a man who's gonna rid me of my shabby little self. How about this? Here lies what's-his-name. He wasn't so unique. Go on. Push the button. Go on. Push that button. I feel sorry for you. I really do. - All right. The debate is over. If you won't do it, I will. (buzzer ringing) - God. (engine roaring) (birds chirping) (engine whirring) (people chattering) - Ladies and gentlemen. Ladies and gentlemen of the press. Thank you for waiting so patiently. This, of course, is our man of the hour, Dr. Frederick. Oh, by the way, there'll be coffee and donuts served in the foyer after the questioning period. - [Reporter] Welcome back from Washington, Doctor. - [Reporter] Doctor, what were Corporal Reese's first words? - What do you think he felt, doctor? What did he see? - Just God. - God? That's all? Just God? - I don't know. It may have been a visual experience. Just don't know. - Would you describe his expression? Would you say he looked happy? - Well, why don't you meet Corporal Reese for yourselves? Ladies and gentlemen, not long ago this man was a hopeless and violent schizophrenic. But you see him now. Tell them how you feel, Corporal. - I feel fine. Just fine. - Corporal Reese, do you ever feel unhappy or depressed? - No. Never. - What about anger? Don't you ever get angry? - No. Not anymore. - I think I'll be revealing a happy fact when I tell you that Corporal Reese talked to the President on the telephone and he received a decoration. - What did the President say, corporal? - He asked me how I felt. - [Reporter] What did you tell him? - I told him I felt fine. - Tell me, Corporal, how did it feel speaking on the telephone with the President? - It was the happiest day of my life. - [Major] Thank you, Corporal. Thank you very much. - [Reporter] Major, we've heard through the grapevine that you're due to make colonel because of this project. What was your role in it? - [Major] From a military point of view I was in charge of the project, and I'm a personal friend of the doctor's. But all the credit belongs to him. And I must say, he did one hell of a job. - [Reporter] Major, what is the military's interest in this experiment? - [Major] The military is always interested in the betterment of mankind. - [Reporter] Doctor, have many failures preceded your success? - [Major] There were no failures. Every step was successful in varying degrees. - [Reporter] What are your plans for the immediate future, Doctor? - [Frederick] That's up to the military now. - [Reporter] No following up experiments, doctor? - [Major] First, he's going fishing. (laughing) - [Reporter] Have the Russians been working in this area? - [Major] Yes, though all indications are that we hold a substantial lead over them. - [Reporter] Do you think they'll have better results than the heart transplants? - [Major] Anything is possible. Well, that's it for now. Coffee and donuts. - [Reporter] Just one more, major. Doctor, what does this mean to the man in the street?
