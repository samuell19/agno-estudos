That doesn't mean I favor the thing and that's understood. - Sit, sit down. - What? - Sit down, I'll clean you up. - Father, what happened? - Your father had another fight at the delivery stable with exquisite Irish timing. - Think nothin', it was retribution. I rent a man a good horse, he brings it back all form and wealth marks. Well I put him in the hospital. I used my fist on him first, then the blackjack. - You used the blackjack? - To make a point, dear. It leaves a lasting impression. I need no motherin'. (hand slapping) - Ow. - I need no motherin'.

It's what I've always wanted to do. - [Rene] How'd you put your act together? - Just kinda developed. - That shuffle that you use in the opening, you copied that from Lou Roth at Minsky's, didn't you? - Yeah, I did. - And that shimmy, where'd you get that? - I got that in Harlem. - Aha. - In (mumbles), I saw five guys up on a stage. - You pay attention, don't you?

I don't think so. (soft waltz music) Mr. Timony, ya haven't said a thing about my act. - I'm a lawyer, Miss West. What do I know about the theater? - You're a man, ain't ya? Ya have feelins. - I most certainly do. Might I suppose you do as well? - (chuckles) Well, you gotta understand. This is all kinda new to me and I've never been out with such an influential man before. - Do you like the feeling? - I don't know.

Seems like awfully hard work. - I guess it does, at that. - There's somethin' I don't understand though. I know this day just pretense and all, but where's the real you? The one I see here is far more appealing, more exciting, more sensual than the one I saw at the theater. - Well I couldn't put that up on stage. - And why not? - I don't know.

What you noticed most, I guess, was her. If I could say out loud, was her navel. (courtroom laughing) (gavel banging) - Alright, alright. - Just a moment, you actually saw her navel? - No no sir, but there was something in her middle. I'm sure of that. (courtroom laughing) - Something in her middle, I see. Can you describe these movements for us? - Why don't I just get up and do it for him? - Mae, they'll hang you. - They're gonna hang me anyway. - Sergeant, we're waiting. - Well sir, this navel of hers would move up and down then left to right. Maybe you should say east to west because then it would go north to south. (courtroom laughing) You really had to be there to see it. (gavel banging) - Quiet. Quiet in the courtroom. Miss West, you've been found guilty of corrupting the morals of youth. Have you anything to say before I pass sentence? - Nah, just go ahead and pass the hemlock. - Bet your pardon? - Well corruptin' the morals of youth. That's what they got Socrates for, ain't it?

Are there others? - Two boys from Yale, a fellow from India, then there's that wrestler. Big guy, 'bout 300. - That's enough. - I know, you know. - What? - Sure. You hired private detectives to follow me all around St Louis, Chicago. Been doin' it for months. Got one here in San Francisco too. - You never said anything to me? - Why should I? We both knew about it. - Mae, I want all this to change. I want you to be faithful to me. - Now look who's talkin'. - It's different with a man. - (scoffs) Where have I heard that before? - Well it is! - Now listen, I heard enough of that talk from my father and I don't need it from you too! - You comparin' me to your father? - In some ways, you're a lot alike. - The hell you say, I'm not like your father. I'm not like anyone. - Honey, I don't want you goin' around thinkin' you're not man enough. Ya are. You're terrific. It's just natural for me to have men around. - Natural. - Yeah. - Natural, is that your word for it? Natural? - Yeah! I never lie. I never claim to be faithful. - And you won't give it up for me? - I won't pretend, Jim! - I gave up my law practice for you; gave up half my business interest to manage you and to be with you and you won't do this one thing for me? - There's no bridle on you, Jim. Why d'you wanna reign me in? - You think about your image then, Mae. We built you into something. This ain't no dime store deal anymore. We're in the big leagues and you're actin' like some cheap tart. Those newspaper guys'll drag you through the street. - Then let 'em drag! - Take it or leave it, is that what you're tellin' me? - I guess so! (furniture and bags smashing) (phone ringing) - Yeah. - Thank you, Father. - Well, whaddya know. The Iron Lady cracks at last. (Mae weeping) - Sorry about your mother, but how about a comment? - How do you feel, Mae? Tell us. - Don't, Jim! (fist bashing) - Miss West, you get me?! Nobody calls her Mae. (somber piano music) - I know, daddy. I know. (sobs) (train bells gonging) (whistle tooting) (lively marching music) - Hello, Mae. - Mr. Kane. - Miss West, Miss West. - I thought I left you back in New York. - Just keep turnin' up, don't I? Like a bad penny. Welcome to California: land of sunlight and censorship. Out here they got a thing called a Hays office. What d'ya think? Can a bad girl of Broadway cut it in Hollywood? - I just hope the fellas can take the heat. - Hey Miss West, do you think? (speech drowned by marching music) (whistle tooting) - Miss West. - Mm-hmm? - Al Kaufman, Paramount Pictures. We're delighted to have you here in California. - Thanks a whole. - Mr. Timony, we've sent you numerous scripts. You keep turning 'em down. - Miss West needs her own material. In case you're unaware Mr. Kaufman, she's a very successful playwright. - You refer to the stage, Mr. Timony. This is Hollywood. On film, she's no leading lady. - What? - For one thing, she's more than a little overweight. - On top of that, she's 40 years old. - 39. Everywhere I go, I set box office records all the way across the country. - Miss West, there's a depression on out there. You're gettin' $5,000 a week. - Now let me tell you what the trouble is. - Mae wait a minute, wait a minute. - No, let me finish. I'm Miss Honkytonk, Broadway's bad girl. You're all afraid of me. Well that's alright. It's your privilege. Here's your money; all 30,000 of it. Better count it, I'm goin' home. - Miss West, just a minute please. We don't want your money. I have a feeling, a strong feeling, that Night After Night will be a very good vehicle for you. - That's George Raft's picture; it's his vehicle. - Have you read it? - Read it? Why, I went over it with a microscope to find my part. I have four scenes in the whole movie. - Four very good scenes; two of them with George Raft. The public will remember you, Miss West. - Excuse me Mr. Kaufman, they remember me already. We're wastin' our time. Gentlemen, no hard feelings. Things just didn't work out. C'mon Jim, let's go. - Miss West? - Yeah, that's me. - I guess you don't remember me, Bill Le Baron. - Yeah sure, how are ya? - Fine, thanks. - Jim, you know Bill. - Hi Jim, nice to see you again. - Hello, Bill. - Yeah, you wrote? - (mumbles) Broadway, sure. - Was a lotta years ago. - You remember that Irish maid sketch I wrote, then you rewrote? - Oh, I played around with it a little. - You made it a hell of a lot better. I'm producing Night After Night. - Oh really? - I was wondering, could you take your scenes and rewrite them for me? I'll give you a free hand. - Wait a minute. Do you mean to say I can take those scenes and do 'em my way? - Right. - What is all this, Archie? - We are shutdown, Mr. Kaufman. - Yeah, I can see that. Why? - Apparently Miss West prefers to direct the picture herself. Isn't that so, Miss West? - Mr. Mayo over here wants to cut the camera after my line, but you can't do that. You gotta stay with me as I go up the stairs. - It's a waste of film, Mr. Kaufman. The scene's over after she's delivered the line. - No, it ain't. If you cut there, you'll kill the laugh. - We're shutdown over that? - Yes, sir. Over that. - Let's see the scene. - Alright, then. Miss West. - Mr. Mayo. - [Archie] Action. - Goodness, what beautiful diamonds. - Goodness had nothin' to do with it, dearie. (men laughing) - It's funny, Archie. - Here comes Raft. - George, what do you think? - Mae West stole everything but the cameras. - Well boys, looks like we got ourselves a brand new movie star. - Yes, she is. - She is not. Mae West is not a movie star. Mr. Timony, surely you can look at this from our position. Diamond Lil's about the gay 90s. Movie audience is young mostly. High school, college kid. They don't anything about that period. They don't care about that period. - Maybe you should stop following trends, Mr. Kaufman and set them. - Perhaps if she had an established star working with her. - Cary Grant. - Who? - She's found some new guy named Grant, Cary Grant. - The stilt walker? - [Man] Sorry for having taken your time. - [Mae] What do ya think my time is for? - [Man] Haven't you ever met a man who could make you happy? - [Mae] Sure, lotsa times. - [Man] I've gotta be getting back to the mission. - [Mae] That oughta be interesting. - It's just one of those things I have to do. Goodnight. - Come up again anytime. It won't be long now. - Cut, print. Let's set up over here. - What do you think? - I think they're very good together. - Do you think she's a star? - Only the audience can say if she's a star. - Miss West. - That Cary Grant, he's a pretty good lookin' guy. - Give us the lowdown, anything goin' on between you and (mumbles)? (muffled crosstalk) - Miss West, you know the very fast edge of the greatest female impersonator of all time? You gotta understand, are you really a man? - Take it from me, Mr. Kane. She's all woman. (reporters laughing) - Ooh, I bet she is. - Yeah, I got about 1,000 references to prove it. - [George] 1,000 references? I don't need 1,000, three'll do. - Well if you got the time. - Alright, everybody out. Alright, that's enough. She's been very kind, hasn't she? Thank you, we'll see you all some other time. - Just one more, c'mon. Hurry, hurry. - C'mon, c'mon Out. - Goodbye. G'night, fellas. - Talkin' to y'all soon. Okay boys, there you go. - Thank you, sir. - And you. - Thank you, sir. - Yeah, thanks a lot. - Thank you, sir. - Thank you. - Well whaddya know. - What? - It's from Kaufmann. - What does it say? - "Thanks for saving our studio." (both chuckling) - Mae, you're on top now. Stage and screen, you can do anything. Anything ya want. - Jim, I got this idea for a picture. I really like this Cary Grant. I think that we can make a great team. - Mae, wait a minute. - What? - There are other things. - What? - Other things. - What other things? - You really don't know, do ya? - What don't I know? - Mae, your career's not everything. Sooner or later, the curtain has to come down. Ya gotta have someone you come home to. Someone you care about, someone who cares about you. - You keep talkin' about my career like it's some separate thing. Like it's not part of me. Me and my career are the same thing. - I want a family life. I want a home. I want children. - Mae West is not a mother! - No, Mae West is not a wife either but she's gonna be. - I am not! - I want you to marry me. - I'm already married. - What did you say? What? - Yeah, I'm already married. Guy named Frank Wallace back in 1911. - When did you plan to tell me about that? - I don't know. Couldn't amount to nothin'. Fact is kinda forgot about it. - You really take the cake, you know that? - Jim, don't be angry. - You lied to me! Who am I to you anyway, some bum you just picked up? Got 15 years invested in you. 15 years of my life. All of a sudden you just turn around to me and you say Jim I forgot to tell ya, I'm married. - I'll never understand you. No man in the world wants to get married! - Well I do! - But it's not a natural state! It's just something invented by women to hang onto men! - You really got it all figured out, don't you? - Yes, I do! - Well I wish you luck. - Where you goin'? - You find yourself another manager. You just lost this one. - No one walks out on me. - You're not writin' this scene, I am. (somber orchestral music) - [Mae] What's your hurry? - I just gotta go. - Somethin's wrong, what is it? - Nothin'. It was great, it was great. Everything they say about you's true. - But what? - That could've been anybody. (soft soothing music) - Hiya, Val. - Morning Mae, how'd you sleep? - D'you see him leave? - You mean the young blond guy? - Yeah cute, huh? See him? - I didn't see anyone. How many pages did you get written yesterday? - I dunno, I'm havin' trouble with that. - You want me to read what you've written? - No don't read it, it stinks. - How 'bout we take a long weekend? Palm Springs. - Too hot. - You owe yourself some time-off, Mae. Don't you think? - [Mae] I'd go crazy with too much time off. - Don't be so hard on yourself. It'll come. - (sighs) I build my whole career around one character and them censors, them holy Joe reformers are tryin' to kill it off. Am I tryin' to harm anyone?! - How 'bout we drive up to Santa Barbara? - (chuckles) Who do you know in Santa Barbara? - (chuckles) No one. I just thought it might be fun. What do ya say? You miss him, don't you? - I never thought I was makin' him so unhappy. I never meant to do that. - [Rene] Why don't you just pick up that phone, call him in New York and tell him just that? - Oh, I couldn't do that. - You cannot go on being a fugitive. - From what? - From life. - Ain't we bein' poetic this mornin'? - Mae, one of these days you are goin' to need someone. Really need someone. Who's goin' to be there? (soft orchestral music) - Mr. Timony, Mr. Abbey's on the phone. - Not now. - It's the third time he's called today. - Not now. - It's about the Madison Square Garden deal. What shall I tell Mr. Abbey? - Whatever you like. - Here, here's your receipt. You're now the proud proprietor of the Brooklyn Bridge. When that one wears out, I'll spell ya. Supposed to be, I'll sell ya a new one. I'm sorry, Eddie. - Cut! - Can we try that one again? - [Man] Hey sweetheart, what seems to be the problem? Anything I can do? - Nah, I just keep blowin' lines. Maybe I just need to get away from it for a minute. - Of course. Alright, let's take a break everybody. Go on out for a coffee, be back in 10 minutes. - Miss West. - Now what? - The two lines here I find very disturbing. First, "I wouldn't even lift my veil for that guy." The question being of course, what would you lift? - Mr. Abbey, I'd hate to have your mind on a good long morning. - One more thing, Miss West if you wouldn't mind. Now this here, coming from you is good deal worse. "I wouldn't let him touch me with a 10 foot pole." - What's wrong with that? - It's perfectly obvious. - You know anybody with a 10 foot pole, Mr. Abbey? Cheer up, your reinforcements just arrived. - Excuse me, Mr. Abbey. Mae? - What are they doin' here now? We're in the middle of shootin'. - Unfortunately Mae, you don't choose a time. They do. - Those local yokels from the Hays office have really got you runnin', don't they? It was supposed to be tonight. - I can't help that. Please, just be careful what you say. - Well when people get shocked easily, they should get shocked more often. - Please? Miss West, may I present Mr. Driggs. Reverend Bragg. Mr. Abbey, you already know. - Intimately. Ain't that right, Abbey? - And Father Cox. - Well fellas, what's the beef? - Sins of the flesh, Miss West. - Oh wait a minute, I never took my clothes off. I never even show my legs. I don't use profanity. - We know that, Miss West. It's a question of attitude. You can do more with lifted eyebrow than a whole army of Ziegfeld girls. - That a compliment? - Well yes, in a way. But it's because of this talent, that you can without intention, of course, have a harmful effect. - Harmful? What's the harm in laughter? C'mon boys, the country's in a big mess. The depression is killing our people's spirits. All I wanna do is make 'em laugh so hard, they wanna forget they wanna cry. - We don't think you're funny, Miss West. As a matter of fact, we think you're obscene. - Obscene? Do you know what I think obscene is? War. Are you guys gonna talk out against war? Are you gonna speak against Mussolini and Hitler? Are you gonna censor war? - Well, what Miss West means. - We understand you're going on national radio. - Yeah, that's right. This Sunday. The Bergen-McCarthy Hour, a little promotional for the new movie. - Charlie McCarthy's one of my favorites. - [Mae] Hello short, dark and handsome. - Hello tall, blond and terrific. - Listen Charlie, are these yours? - Charlie, where did you get those keys? - You better tell him, Mae. - If you wanna know, he came up to see me and I showed him my etchings. (audience laughing softly) - Is that all there was to it, just etchings? - (chuckles) He's so naive. - Why don't you come home with me now, Charlie? I'll let you play in my woodpile. - [Charlie] Well, I don't know. - You weren't so shy the other night. You didn't need any encouragement to kiss me. - Did I do that? - You certainly did. I got the marks to prove it; slivers too. (audience laughing) - Tonight we turn back time and step into the Garden of Eden. Under a spreading fig tree rests one Mr. Adam. Eve, obviously, is bored beyond endurance. - Listen, Adam honey, I want a little excitement. - What for? This is Eden. Everything is peaceful, quiet and safe. - Adam, you don't know a thing about a woman. - Oh, you apparently forget. You are originally one of my own ribs. - Yeah, ribbed once and now I'm beefin'. (audience laughing and applauding) - Well then what do you want, trouble? - If trouble means somethin' that makes your blood run through your veins like Seltzer water. Adam my man, give me trouble. (audience laughing) - That's right. A telegram to Lennox Lohr. President, NBC Radio Network. Sir, you have mistakenly chosen Sunday night to air a totally indecent, religiously scurrilous piece of pornography. Your association with such vulgarity and with Miss West will be brought to the attention of federal authorities. - Al, I was just talking to the head. - No more phone calls. - But when I tell you who it was. - I said I'm takin' no more phone calls. - Will you look at this? Some senator from Massachusetts wants the House to investigate radio. - Here's a guy that wants the station's license revoked. Today it's the stations, tomorrow the theaters. - My God, it's Armageddon. (poster shredding) - Mr. C wants our decision right now. - [Man] The calls keep coming in, Al. - [Man] What do you wanna do, Al? - We got a company to run. Let's dump 'er. (soft soothing music) (Bill speaking foreign language) - The fear of the gods. (car backfiring) Every day. (car backfiring) - Call this a dressing room? Why in Paramount, I had closets bigger than this one. - C'mon, it's better than anything - Now they expect me to give up half my writing credits. (mumbles) comes in and does some lousy changes. - Ah, my little flute player. - I told you not to call me that. - Pardon me dear, no offense intended. (winces) - Come on, Bill. - That blonde tripped me. - (chuckles) Come on, sit down over here. - Thank you Valentine, you are an officer and a gentleman. - Bill, go home and sleep it off. - Madam, are you implying I partook of the grape? - [Mae] Ya soused. - That's (speaks foreign language). - Bill, stop tryin' to be so cute and go home! I'll shot around ya. - (chuckles) Shoot around me? - Shoot around ya. - Yeah may be right, a little nap; kind of a afternoon restorative. Valentine. - That son of a sea cook, the gin is in the orange. Bill! (fist thudding) (Bill mumbling) (door slamming) - Maybe he'll be better on the next picture. They have an option now for two more. - With him? Once is enough, I rather not work. (weights clanging) (waves whooshing) - [George] Must be boring. - I thought I told you to call my secretary, Mr. Kane. - Doesn't seem to like me. - She's not alone. - What's with this Wallace guy? He for real? Were you really his wife? - We had been married, but I never was a wife. - What's with this psychic stuff, this mumbo jumbo? You talk seance to some medium, some Jack Kelly. - I'm lookin' for answers to questions you've never asked. - Almost three years without a picture. Still gonna do that silly musical over at Columbia? - I might. - Better than nothin', I guess. - Let's go. - Ain't easy is it, Mae? - It's a dream, Mr. Kane. Jim? - Hello, sweetheart. (Mae weeping) (lips smacking) - Honey, it's good to see you. Oh Jim, no man ever understood me the way you do. - Nobody understands you? Half the time you don't understand yourself. That's why I came out. Oh Mae whatever it's like with ya, it's a hell of a lot worse without ya. How's that picture? - Oh, Jim. - Don't worry. We'll fix it. We'll fix everything. (car engine rumbling) - I think it's time we leave this town. - And go where? - I don't know. Maybe we should go back to Broadway and get arrested again. What do ya think? Jim? Jim? Jim. (waves crashing) (seagulls squawking) - Take Diamond Lil to Broadway. - Oh, Jim. - Right now. Don't stick around for me. - You haven't missed an opening of mine for 30 years. - I want you to do it, Mae. I want you to do it for me. Please.

"About as wicked as a sophomore beer night and smoker, "so what was all patrol wagon rumpus about?" (crowd laughing) "It is 20 years since Mae singed in New York." - [Mae] "With the study of anatomy "but Mae's holdin' out alright "and has in fact become part of American folklore". How do you like that? American folklore. - You've done it, Mae. You've opened the door. Opened it? Hell, you kicked it in. Honey, you've won. You're here to stay. - They loved it, Jim. I really think we started somethin'. - [Jim] If only Hollywood could see it, huh? - They will alright, honey in about another 20 years so. - And you'll be ready for 'em, won't you? Oh gee, I wish I could be there with you. - (weeps) Long time ago you said, "One day the curtain was gonna come down." Well it came down tonight. I'm goin' home to nobody. - [Jim] Oh but Mae, you're a great success. - It could be (sobs) if you were here with me. - Thank you for that. - Jim, I realize it's too late for this but I love you dearly. I really do. (waves whooshing softly) - Goodnight. (soft nostalgic music) (soft soothing music) (soft chime jingle) (Multicom Jingle)
