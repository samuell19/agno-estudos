Good morning, Madame Reichert. Ah, José! I need your car again. Can I borrow it? Thanks mate! -Good morning kids. -Good morning Maria. Let's go! I've been trying to reach her for three weeks! I'm sick of her. -They don't do anything, I assure you! -Look... "Have a nice day, my 'bacalhauzinho'(codfish)" -Are you coming? -Yes. {\b1}" A Gaiola Dourada " " The Golden Cage "{\b0} I heard this year the jury will be particularly demanding. All the details will be considered! One rosebush with a bad cut, and we can say 'goodbye' to the first prize, which to me is unthinkable. We have to work even more, Maria! -Yes, ma'am! -The mail arrived late today. The postman came without "bêlo". (bicycle = vélo) "Vélo", Maria. It's "V", not "B". And it's not "Birgin" as well. Oh, by the way, I wanted to talk to you about the lodge enlargement, I fought for you, Maria, but it'll not be possible this year. It is too expensive. It's the crisis! But you should know that the board stressed how are indispensable both, you and José are to us. Thank you ma'am. Not at all. Maria! You have a break now! -Good morning Lourdes, Rosa. -Good morning, Madame Richier. Reichert! Maria! Don't forget the dress I gave you. I like that dress so much. It was my mother's, you know. I got it, ma'am. She's taking the piss out of you! Everyone's just using you! You're so kind, like your husband. You two do everything for free... Too kind, too silly. Well, let's talk serious now. Here it is! "The two Cods" "Whole Portugal on your plate!" So? -I don't know. -Yeah, as if you know anything! -So what?! -Shh! Maria, what do you think? I'm not sure if it is a good idea, "Les 2 Morues" ("The two cod") What? -You are not sure? -No. We've been working on it for a year! Now we just wait for the Bank's agreement. Don't let me down! This project is all my life! Lourdes, calm down! I was only talking about the name. I won't let you down! What are you talking about? I hope you don't! Because I can't take it anymore... I can't clean anymore! I want to be an independent woman. -Free. -Ask for the divorce! And let Carlos get a half of everything? I'd rather die! José! Yes, boss? We will have to work this weekend. I'll not be here, though. My wife... There's no problem. I saw a guy without a helmet. We'll be fined by the labor inspectorate! -I told them already. -Fortunately, I have you. -Enjoy your meal, gentlemen. -Thank you, Mr. Caillaux. I'm sorry about the weekend... -It's not a problem Mr. Caillaux. -Charles. -It's okay, Mr. Charles. -Thank you. -Enjoy your meal. -Thank you. Ouuuuh. "Mr. Charles"! Now you're best buds with the boss's son? José is almost French. They put {\i1}camembert{\i0} in his codfish. {\i1}Frenchy{\i0}. He's so French he even doesn't have a house in Portugal. Epah, shut up! A good Portuguese man works hard to support his the family. And he doesn't spend all his money in a bar like you do. -We are just kidding. -Sorry for interrupting, but I'm looking for Mr. José Manuel Teixeira Da Costa Ribeiro? Yes. Is it you Mr. José Manuel Teixeira... José Ribeiro I'm mandated by the Ministry of Justice And I got a call from the Notary to deliver this in person. -Shouldn't I sign it? -Ah yes, sorry. It's okay. There! "Obrigada" (PT - Thank you) -And the envelop? -Oh, sorry! Thank you. -"Thank you!" -Salam aleikhum. "Dear Mr.Ribeiro," "on behalf of Pereira da Costa in Porto, Portugal," "we regret to inform you that your brother..." "Francisco" "Fernandes Teixeira Da Costa Ribeiro" "died unexpectedly last week at his home, in Portugal" We had an uncle and you never told us... Shh. Your father had his reasons. There're always good reasons not to tell us things. We hadn't talked to each other for about 30 years. Even so, Zé, your brother is dead. If we didn't return to Portugal, it was because of him. He stole our inheritance. He was not a part of my family anymore. That's all. Come on... Continue. "Although your brother was buried without you," "he made ​​you his sole heir." "You inherit his family house, his 227 acres of land," "from which there are 42 acres of vineyards, as well as 100% of shares" "of the {\i1}Quinta do Namu{\i0}'s company, exporter of Portwein." -Holy fuck! We are loaded! -What is "loaded"? Lots of dough! Rich! We are rich! We are rich, rich... -Stop! -Is it worth anything? -With assets generating an annual income of 200,000 euros. -Per year? The assets! How much is it? About... 40 000 Contos. Do you see? I'm going to have my own house in Portugal. -Hold on! "There is a condition precedent:" "you must maintain the family business," "as well as reside in Portugal." "Otherwise everything will be sold in auction and the profits" "given to the parish community." The parish community? It was only missing that! "To be signed at the notary in 3 weeks." We are going. -You are leaving, Paula moves out... I get to keep the place... -Hold on! We'll tell everyone that we're leaving after we sign this. -I'm not going to {\i1}Tugaland{\i0}(Portugal)! -Me neither. -You have to tell your boss. And the building? -Yes, we have to tell them... -Yes! But what will they think? -That Maria and José slaved for 30 years and they deserved it. Stop seeing problems everywhere. Mum, you've dreamed about your own house there. Be happy! -Yes, we are happy. -Yes. -So... smile. -Every time I have to sneak under your parents' windows like a thief... -Poor you... -My years of playing "Hide & Seek" to see my girlfriend are long gone. I'm sorry for being my father's son. -It's not the point! -What then? Should I grow a mustache that "fache le portugueche"? -No. Mustache is ony for women. -Ah, okay... We touched a sensitive topic. I decided to learn Portuguese. -You? What for? -For starters... to tell your parents that their daughter is engaged in despicalbe sexual activities. -Funny, I've no memories of that. You're mistaking me for someone else. -Surely I'm not. I have to refresh your memory. -I'm up for it. -Look the codfish... He he! Let's eat... -Thanks. -Ah, this is good codfish! My wife doesn't know how to do it like that! -Go fuck yourself! -Lurdes! -The children! -What? They don't understand. Go fuck yourself! Shit! Son of a bitch! Who taught you that? Carlos. That makes you laugh? They are bilingual, listen. God give me strength to put up with this creature. Well, kids, it's over. Go and play football. Are you happy? Hi Paula! -You're late. -I was finishing a file. -On a Sunday? And who brought you here? -It's none of your business. -Is it your "boyfriend"? -No, it's not my boyfriend. -Everything okay? -Did you see Miguel again? No mum, it's over a long time ago. I never understood why. -He was so good for you. -Paula doesn't want a "Tuga" (Portuguese guy). -She'll wants an Arab boyfriend. So what? Is there any problem with that? If he believes in God... Important thing is that he is kind and hardworking. Okay? Well, cheers! And lets eat! Did you practice football today? Leave the kid alone! You only think about football... I guess this is the right moment to tell you... Maria, do you know already? What? Attention! Ladies and gentlemen, I have great news to announce. You have in front of you the chief... executive... officer... of the "The Two Cods Limited"! The Bank approved the loan! Our life is going to change! Calm down there! She didn't win a lottery! No! That's, João Da Silva, de Argenteuil. Won the Super Jackpot. And didn't say a word to anyone! Yes, I know. That bugger doesn't even pay for a round after a game. And his wife puts on a mysterious look with her diamond big as an apple. -So much money at once makes you loose your mind. People are not the same anymore. Of course. They will talk about us behind our backs just like about João da Silva. No! What should I do about Lourdes? And the building! Madame Reichert needs me so much. And Mr. Caillaux counts on you. We will be seen as selfish. All that for living in Portugal alone. We'll not be alone. What about our children? Don't you see that they're French, Zé? They have their roots in Portugal! This is our country. That house was built by my great grandfather with his own hands. Pedro is the first man of the family not to have been born there. You've been complaining about not having an house there. The house of my dreams... But now we have it, and we are going to live there... The family will! 30 cents less than in Argenteuil. Do you know who is getting the lodge of Deolinda De Campos? Let me guess... ...some Romanian girl. -Exactly. They're taking all the lodges from us, those bitches! -What do you want? It's the globalization. -Fuck it! Enough about your lodges! You are in love with Mr. Caillaux, your boss! -Me? In love with a bald guy? -A bald guy? -Yes! Poor man. He's afraid of getting implants. So, he wants to get hair extensions! -Just like João Da Silva! -He's bald as well! -Shut up... You believe everything people say. João Da Silva with extensions... More coffee? My own sister doesn't tell me anything. Me! -Your own sister... -And why doesn't she tell me anything? Why did she keep the inheritance a secret? -Secret... You listen to me carefully! Not a word about this to anyone. I don't want her to think that I've been gossiping. It's not my style. -Me? I'll be silent as the grave. You didn't hear this from me! -I won't say a word. -Are you sure? Will Rosa get Maria's lodge? -Yes, but don't tell anyone. Not a word to anyone! -Okay, I'm not saying another word. Stop it! -A multi-million inheritance. Can you imagine a Romanian girl replacing Maria? -No, I don't want even to imagine that. What do you mean? -What's all that nonsense? If José wanted to leave, I would know. -No! It's a secret, Mr. Caillaux. No one else can know! -Well, it makes a total of... 23 560 euros. That's how much we saved thanks to Ribeiros last year alone. We'll never find anyone like them. Do we all agree? We have to keep them here. And I have an idea... Your account is overdrawn! You have to come! -Is is that bad? 50 000 euros! -Alright, I understand. -Ah, dad! -I'll call you back. -I talked with the costumers about the shopping mall. We are the first on the list to do the job, that's good! -Ah... That is really good, yes. Ah, and the construction foreman... They want the same guy from the one in Clichy. It's José. It told them no problem, we would do it! My favourite cashmere sweater. I'm sick, sick, sick of it..! Nobody cares? You have to talk to her. -Yes. Me? Talk to her? She never listens to me! You go and talk to her. -Me? -Are you scared of her or what? -Me? Scared of Rosa? Me, scared of Rosa... Give me that! We'll see about that. Rosa! I've to talk with you. -Is there a problem, Mr. Francis? -We... We will have dinner at what time? -At 20 o'clock, as usual. -20 o'clock? Ah, 20 o'clock, yes. Great. 20 o'clock, it's great. -Try it! -Again? -Try it, I'm telling you! -Carlos. He couldn't digest the creme. Try it. -It's not yet like Maria's... Shit! How does she do it? How does she do it? -There are talented people... and the others. -And me? I'm not talented, right? I'm screwed. Without my sister, I'm screwed. -Gosh! I hope he doesn't die in there... Poor man. -Maria? My God, Maria. It's terrible. It's Carlos... I'll call you back. Yes, bye. Did you see your uncle? -Don't worry mum. Uncle Carlos is made of steel! And your sister exaggerates everything. -This time we don't know it. Think a little bit about yourself for once! Look, the weekend in hotel I gave you as a present will expire soon. It won't be valid in 15 days. -Really? -Yes, go! Make me happy! It'll only do you good. To taste a new life a bit. -I would like to, yes, but who will take care of the lodge? And your father in a hotel? He doesn't even go to restaurants. Unbelievable. You only think about work. What will you do when you both retire? Well, I'm going... Kiss. Ah, mum... Did you talk to Madame Reichert? No, but I will. -Do you want me to go with you? -No, there's no need. I'll go alone. Madame Reichert? -Maria! I allowed myself in... I've got excellent news. This is Xavier Delorme, architect. Good morning Sir. He will enlarge the lodge. I made the board change their minds. What about the crisis? The crisis will have to wait! As you are going to stay with us for many years... -Exactly, I wanted to say... -It's a huge investment, we all had to tighten the belts. And it's not all! I've also bought the newest Dyson vacuum cleaner. And I have decided to ease your duties and hire someone to help you to clean the big windows. So Maria? Won't you say anything? -Thank you. -Oh, José... You wanted to see me? -Yes, Mr. Caillaux. -Great, I was looking for you too. Please, take a sit. -Thank you. -Balisto? -No, no. -Voluto? -No, thank you. -Tell me... For how long have you and I been working together? 20, 25 years? -32. Time goes by so fast. 32 years! We built so many great things together. -Especially me. -Yes, especially you. I said to myself... "My friend José must want something else." -Eh, yes... -Manual labour is rewarding, true. But still... 32 years of experience with concrete, that's quite something! -Mr. Caillaux, I... -For starters, I'll raise your salary. -But why? -We need a right hand. Someone trustworthy on whom we can rely. -Sure, but... -We need the construction contract for the shopping mall. Otherwise... ...I'll have to fire your colleagues. And that would be very, very regrettable. -Yes. José, I need you. I really do. -Yes. -Well, let's have lunch with the costumers then. -And now, you're screwed. Go, play! -I'm going home. -Where are you going? -Home. I have to study for the exams. -You are not made for studying! Practice football! Pauleta! That's the future. -I can't take it any more. José is a lucky bastard. Can you imagine? She doesn't trust me. -She wants to keep all the money! What do you think? -My sister is not like that. -Your sister will take the money, quietly pack her bags and leave! Exactly. That's what I said. -Shut your mouth! You are both selfish. Maria knows I need her for "The Two Cods" -He who believes... Your sister that hides the truth from you? Now there's only one cod, not two. And that cod has lost the game. -Can you tell me now what it is? -One can never surprise you! You have to control everything. -I just don't like little secrets. -You don't like little secrets? -No. -Why are we hiding then? -We are not hiding. Look. -Hey! Thank you. -Did you enjoy the show? -Yes. -I liked it. He made me laugh! Those jokes! Oh, wait. My jacket. -Paula! I didn't know you were coming. I would have invited you. -I didn't come to see you. -Lovely. -That's not what I meant. I didn't know it was you. Someone brought me here without me knowing. Congratulations, people loved it. It was great. -What about you? Did you like? A little ridiculous, no? -It's what they call humour. -Really? Oh, sorry. -Come and see me some time. It'd be great. -You two know each other? -Yes. You too? - Yes. -Well... Miguel, the ex. -Charles... The boyfriend. -Did you like the performance? -It was fun. Fun? Okay. -Let's go? -Yes. -Bye. -Bye. -Isn't he a bit ugly, when you see him up close? How could you even stand his jokes? -You're right. We have to stop hiding. -Hi, Maria! -Good morning, Manuel. Good morning! -Good morning! -I've been waiting for you. -Why didn't you knock? -I'll be away for 3 days. You have to take care of my bonsais. -Okay, I'll tell my mother. -Don't bother your mother with this. She has a lot of work. Here you have my keys. I'm counting on you. -Pedro watering the plants? Take that! -Right in your "Tuga" face! -Snout! -Shut up. -Okay... I'm mad as hell. My parents didn't let me throw a party. Canceling everything one day before. They make me sick. I have to find another place for my party. Oh!? Are you okay? -Yes, everything's fine! Maybe I'll go to live in Portugal. -Portugal? It sucks... -Sucks? Have you been there? -No, but... It sucks that you are leaving. Doesn't leave much time for us. -I have an idea for your party. -Do you? -Yes. -Everybody thinks it's easy, but it's not. Building a wall has to be well planned in advance. It's not just a brick, cement, another brick and more cement. We tell ourselves that... in 100 years this wall will still be standing. It must protect our children. People will lean on it. It has to be solid, so that nothing bad happens. In the place where I'm from... A wall is usually one extra room in the house. The family gets bigger. -You are an ambassador of your trade. -Oh! No... When you come from a poor country, you don't become an ambassador. You become a mason. Hmm... This wine is good! -Pommard 1979. -The year I came to France. -Francis, I believe we will do this project together. -You've chosen wisely. You won't regret it. -You'll only need to add one more clause specifying that Mr. Ribeiro will manage the works. -There are others who can do it! -José, you're the best! -I want that shopping mall... ...to be built by an artist. -Voilá! -Oh yes. -First, you wash it with a sponge, very hot water, and a little bit of vinegar. I like to add a few lemon drops. It's my personal touch. Then we dry it with a newspaper. But the most important thing is to rub very well. Like that: from bottom to top. Bottom to top. -Did you understand? From bottom to top. -Yes, from bottom to top. -Mrs. Bertrand, good morning. -Good morning, Maria. -Shouldn't I take care of the kids? -Don't worry! We'll do it ourselves! -Good morning, Maria. -Good morning. -Good morning, José. -What's going on? Why are you here? What's going on? -Are you drunk? -A little. -What's that? -A present from the management. -What is that suit? -It's a Scovaneli! Where have you been? A business lunch. -And where's your lunch box? -Still there. -Still there? Perfect! -Good morning, Maria. -Good morning, Guillaume. I'll sort it myself, don't worry! -You know Maria, I'm an artist... It's what they said. An artist who drinks wine from 1979... ... and who's in deep shit. -Good morning. -Have you seen your drunken father? What a shame... And he says he doesn't like restaurants. Won't you say anything? -No. I keep forgetting - you don't care about what people think. Yes, I don't care. There are more important things in life. -Are there? -Yes. That I've got a boyfriend, for one. Dad, mum... ...I'm in love. Her name is Paula. Paula Ribeiro. -It's Charles Caillaux. -Charles?! -I know, dad, he's your boss's son. What will people say? "What a shame!" Screw them! I don't care. Ribeiro... Francis, Ribeiro... Is it not José, the Portuguese... The Portuguese construction chief? -It's funny. -It's his daughter. -You see? Didn't I tell you? Good news, isn't it? -It's excellent news! I have much respect for Ribeiros. -Me too. -Great, because I believe she is the woman of my life. He makes me happy. He believes in God. He's hardworking and kind. Isn't he, dad? -See? I'm in deep shit! -What? Let's have diner with them. All together around a gazpacho. -Yes, that's good, a gazpacho. Your mother is right! Let's invite them over to get to know each other and to celebrate the contract for the shopping mall that we landed! -Why didn't you say? You didn't tell me anything! -I don't tell you everything. -It's great. I wonder if the Portuguese like gazpacho. I'll check on Wikipedia. I am now intrigued. Do it. Calm down already! I don't feel well. Here we go again. What's going on? What would I do without you! -What? The doctors won't say anything before the exams, but... it's serious! I'm sorry, I've got to go. Have a nice weekend. Call me when you get to the hotel! -Paula, we have to talk. -Weekend? You never go anywhere for a weekend? -What? -Nothing, forget it... -Where are you going? -Looks like Versailles! Come on, Zé. Lets enjoy this for our daughter. I could've been enjoying Benfica-Porto game... at home! I'll get it. How are you doing? Fine? -Yes, great. You saved my party by inviting us to your home. -Room service. -Fillet from cold seas, virgin sauce and rare vegetables. Have a nice tasting. You've told me he would be a nice boss. Better than his father. So he's good for our Paula. On the other hand, I'll have to return to France... She cannot organize her wedding alone. -What wedding? They are just dating and you are already seeing children. They have just met. It is nothing serious. We've been invited by Caillaux. -Oh my gosh! It is serious! -Hi. There are curves, the movement... Emotion. You can see what the man wanted to express! -Your father is really talented. Does he exhibit? What's his name? Ribeiro, like me. -Are you Spanish? -No, I'm Portuguese. The only Portuguese whose father is not a mason and mother concierge. -You live in total ignorance! -I agree! It's too too hard for your back. Have you told Madame Reichert? Yes. And did you talk to your boss? -Yes, yes. I'll tell her when you tell your boss. -You're right! It's too hard for my back. -Let's go! Leave it! -All messed up looks bad. -What are you doing there? And you? Stop jumping on the sofa. What... Are you smoking the bonsai? Girls, get down from there! Careful with the carpet! What are you waiting for? You're making too much noise. Come in! Come in! -What a bore! -Everybody inside! Oh! My parents! Everybody out, fast! In or out? I'm confused. -There's a party at Jeanne's! -Hurry up! Good evening, ma'am! -Who is that? I'm the concierge of the building. Please don't tell his parent anything. Come! -Mum? Does this car brake properly? Yes. Porsche is known for it's braking system. -Don't you have van version? -No, no. We don't produce Porsche Kangoo. But we do have Cayenne 4x4. -It's diesel car, diesel, yes. -Ah... -It's the best vehicle in the world. -Perhaps. But I know you salesmen well. It's all fine at the start, but once you've paid - they don't care anymore. Tell me, can one attach a trailer here? Personally, I have nothing against it, but... Just checking. -Like that? -Uh, well... "Boa noite". Like that: "Boa noite". Say it faster, very fast. -It is impossible! -Your football gives me headache! And that we are hosting them here because of the you. -I like to eat at home. At least I know what I'm eating. -The last time I went to the restaurant I got a heartburn. -Heartburn from the drink. -That also, yes. -Hurry up! They're on their way! We've to get everything ready! They could have come here. Rosa would have cooked the diner. -Maria cooks very well. You'll See. -I hope she has not made calf. It's the Portuguese tradition. The girl's parents should invite us over. Isn't it, Rosa? -Yes, it is. Tradition my arse... Everything will be alright. We just have to relax. I'm not the first one you introduce to your parents. Nothing to worry about. For example, your ex, the comedian. Did it go well? Paula, what's going on? I'm just kidding! You're strange since the morning. -I've taken a pregnancy test. -The result was positive. -Positive? -In which way? -I'm pregnant, Charles. -Everything will be okay. Are you okay? -Yes. Okay. Yes. -Yes. -Yes. -Zé, take it. -A tie? One would think we are having the Queen of England over. We want to make good impression. It's the least we can do. And let's not talk about us leaving. It's Paula's diner. Good night, Mrs. Caillaux, Mr. Caillaux. Please come in. I'll call Maria. There she is! -"Buenas noches" (Spanish), Maria! -"Buenas noches". It's such a pleasure to see you. Thank you very much. You shouldn't have. It's nothing, you know... It's tulips. You know, like your beautiful revolution in Portugal. No, those were carnations, honey. Carnations, tulips... What counts is that they fought with flowers and not weapons. I'm sorry to receive you in this mess. I had a very busy day. Forget the formalities. We are simple people. Your home is lovely. Looks like a doll's house. Thank you. Do you want to have a look around the house? José, our children together... Who would have thought? Not me. Must be the kids. -Good night. -Good night. What happened here? -This wine is excellent! Isn't it, José? -It is! -Our children make such a lovely couple! -Yes. When I see the dark circles around Charles's eyes when he gets home... in the morning, I tell myself, they are having good time together. -Gets home from where? -Mr. Caillaux, would you like more wine? Francis, please! Now that we are family. What dark circles? -Solange, do you want more? -Yes. Maybe it's too much, but today we are celebrating! Don't drink too much, Solange. -What about a toast? -Yes, good idea. So, here's to the Caillaux-Ribeiro and their many years together! Right, José? -"Saúde"(pt) Cheers! -What? -"Saúde". -"Saoude", it's what I said. "Saoude". -Excellent! -It's famous, yes. I would say fam... -I'm sorry. -That upholstery is strange. What is it? It's to protect the fabric from stains. It's new, I didn't have time to take the plastic off. -Do you like Picasso? -Picasso? Yes! We love Picasso. Especially José! Nonsense, we always buy Peugeot. We are talking about paintings, José! If you could be so kind to go to the table... That dictatorship of the general Alcazar was terrible. Terrible! It's "Salazar", mum. -What? "Saint-Lazare"? - Salazar. Alcazar is from Tintin. I always confuse them. There it is. You may open. Looks good. Veal with rare vegetables. Ladies and gentlemen, have a nice tasting. Thank you, Maria. Charles, have you been to Portugal? No. I'm counting on Paula to take me there. You'll see, you wouldn't want to leave it. It's true, Portugal is a very beautiful country. But, with the crisis there, it is better to stay here. Have you ever thought about returning? -Yes, they plan to return there. -What about you? Us? What a question... -We... We are from here. -Yes, yes... -We are in our country here. -Yes. Maria, we are French, we have always been... -It's really good, Maria. Thank you. -Very good. -Excellent. To be honest, I thought we would eat codfish. Yes, yes, I love codfish : "Bacalhau a bràtch". Voilá, "bràtch"! It's good! It's my specialty, but I didn't know that you liked it. I'll bring the cakes. Maria, don't. -It's really good! -Maria, the veal is enough. If that pleases you, well... -I'm going to help you. -Yes, go. Your cakes are really good! - Mum, what's going on? -What are you talking about? About all this circus! Look at you! Mum! We are doing this for you. I wasn't complaining about the veal. -Eat what you have. -No! I'll wait for the cakes. -Mum, eat... -I'll wait for the cakes. What does she want now? She needs me every day. Must be nice to feel indispensable. Yes, but she wont let me go the whole evening. Then don't open it. -It can be important. -I'll get it. -Let's see if it's important. -Now she's gonna play a concierge! Madame Caillaux... '"Bonsoirch". -Good evening, is Maria here? -No, she is go out. -And you are? -Imaculada, cousin from Portugal. -Can I help you? -I need José right away. I've a problem with the toilet flush. But José no fix toilets at 10 o'clock in the night. -Listen to me well, Madame... Culada! -"Culadach". Get me José now! Understood? Or do I need to translate it? Who do you take yourself for? Have you no shame? Go and figure. Bothering me at 10pm because of a toilet when I'm having a family evening at home. -I'm telling you already, no! -What? There is no "what". Fingers away. Good bye, Madame. Gosh! This woman drives me crazy. Imaculada... I've been wanting to do this for a long time! Well, it's done, no need to do it anymore. And if you're looking for a replacement, you already have it. Nice, because it will be needed soon. Is this diner or a theatre performance? I'm sorry, I'm leaving. Can't take it any longer. Paulinha, don't be rude. Better being rude than ridiculous, mum. Shut up! I'm sorry. Forgot that we can't say what we think. Keep up appearances, remain unnoticed and don't live, right? You let everyone and their dog take advantage of you! -Or do you actually enjoy it? -Ungrateful. I'm pregnant. It's true, dad. Your dear daughter is pregnant and is not even married. That's shameful. Paula! Paula, hold on! Hold on! -It cannot work. -Stop. -It can't work between us. -What? What's your problem? Listen to me. Stop. What are you afraid of? That I'll find out that you come from a working class. That you're a Portuguese girl with issues? -Is that how you see me? -That's what you are! Are you want to have a kid with a girl like that? Did you talk to your sister? Yes. I think we should leave her alone. -She needs peace. -Peace? She needs peace? Dad? I'm not leaving. Let's go. - Pedro, how are you? - Fine. Good morning, I'm Cassiopêe, a school friend. Good morning, I'm his father. -You are the painter? -Among other things. -We gotta go. -I really like your works. Thank you. Where can we see them? At the moment, I'm in Aubervilliers. We have a lot to do. Mum is waiting for us. -In the gallery? -No, we finished the gallery last month. We are building a parking place right now. But we haven't started painting yet. Yes, I see. I've got to go. Nice to meet you, sir. Me too. - Your friend is pretty. - Cassiopêe! I'm going. -Wait! Cass', Listen. -Lair. I acted like an idiot there. Why did you lie to me? Why? To make you like me. The concierge you spoke with was my mother. Now you don't say anything? All right. Francis, we are going to be grandparents. Everything okay? What a diner. We have a lot to talk about. I think so. Dad, why did you raise José's salary. Because I thought he deserved it. After so many years... -Of course. -He is going to be your father-in-law. It's the family. Tell me instead that you knew about the inheritance. You knew that they were going to leave, but you need him. It's convenient to you that I date his daughter. That way, you keep José and the contracts. What a performance last night. Bravo! Francis, what's that about? How do you even know that? It's unbelievable! I never know anything in this house! -Why? No idea. -Mum, it's not the moment! -Sorry. It's complicated. -I'm used to it. I would like to see what you would do. If we didn't sign this contract we would have to close the company. For 2 years there's no job. You have to see the reality. And it's true. Anything that stops José from leaving, makes me happy. - I didn't know. - You don't know everything. What? I did it for us. Damn it! I didn't say anything... It wasn't necessary to slap her in front of everybody. Your daughter doesn't want to see us and she's pregnant. And Carlos is getting worst. We are abandoning everyone by returning to Portugal. I can't take it anymore. I've got to talk with my sister. -What are you doing? -I can't take it anymore. -It's me. -Maria, nice you called me. I was about to call you, we have to go to the bank to sign things. -Right. I'm on my way to you. -What? You can't see Carlos in this conditions. -Why? -It's contagious. He's going to quarantine. Poor him, he's there, on the bed. Suffering more and more every time. If you could only see him, Maria... -I am seeing him. -What do you mean you're seeing him? He still can't play well. How could you lie to me? About his health! It's a sin! That's a sin now? And you? You planned to abandon me! You didn't tell me anything about the inheritance! -You know about that? -What do you think? Everybody knows! The presents, the extension of the lodge... And you? The salary increase and the boss's suit - was is Santa Claus, perhaps? That's why you pretended that he's sick. We want you to stay. "Too kind, too silly", isn't it? Let's go Zé, we have nothing else to do here. Are you happy now? Everybody knew. Paula is right. They're taking advantage of us. Everything they want, we do without complaining. Would you let your slaves leave? The lovely couple that never says "no". My God... We were so dumb. We are the clowns. Do you know what I want? To talk to Madame Reichert and say everything to her face. To take her mother's dress and wash windows with it. Yes, that's what we shall do. What? Destroy Reichert's dress? Better than that! Let's see who are the clowns here! Mail. -Good morning, kids. -Good morning, Maria. They'll get late. Zé, good you're here, could you... -Good morning, Mr. Caillaux! -Good morning! Where's Maria? Good morning, Mrs. Reichert. Have a nice day. CONCIERGE CLOSED I hope that the jury is absolutely impartial. Our decisions are completely transparent. Yes, yes, of course. I don't want to influence it any way. Let me tell you that you're going to like what you'll see. Stunning! Mindblowing! Good morning. Care for a sardine? Or maybe a beer? Maria. I think the poor bougainvillea is thirsty. Very well done. Wait, wait, ladies. Don't leave so early. I'll prepare you a green tea with parsley. It'll do you good. -It's my mobile. Can you get it for me? -Yes, sure. Hello! Yes. Who? Hold on. I'll check. Some Miguel. Yes, Miguel. Hello? Enough wasting water! Rosa! I have had it with you showering all day long - you are not a fish! Your depression is laughable! -Get out! -Here, shave! I don't like that beard of yours. -Leave me alone! -You're going to be a father, Charles! I'll tell you something: You'll get off your arse and go to this address, because your Paula has been staying at Miguel's for a week. What?! Damn it! Damn it! Well, it's done. Come on, there's a quiche waiting for us. Open it, you bastard. Paula! Paula! Open it! I know you're there! Forgive me, Paula! I was stupid! I want that child. Open me the door! Luckily the neighbor has already died. -You bastard. -Who is this freak? This is Charles. Finally, it's about time. You took long. Where's Paula? Romane, my fiancée. Okay, I acted like a freak. -A little, yes. -Yes. Surely, this is not the reference wall for the shopping centre? Yes, actually it is. -But... -Pardon. Excuse us. José... What's that supposed to mean? I'm in deep shit right now! This contract is worth millions. We are already late and you come up with this piece of shit? How long have you known that I'm leaving for Portugal? You don't respect me. Yes, this wall is great like that. - Is there any problem? - No, certainly not! Any other questions? We have been always kind to you, Maria. Very few employers are this understanding. And how did you thank us? The repugnant spectacle with your husband and my flowers. I don't even want to mention your cousin, Madame Culada. Are you talking to me about understanding, Madame Reichert? After everything I did for this building, after all these years? I saw the little Bertrand being born. I took care of Mr. Zu when he was sick. I cared for your plants as if they were my own children. Cared for this building as if it were my own. For 30 years I did nothing but that. And I did it with pleasure. It's my job, so I must do it well. I would like you to say: "Maria is a good concierge". But you're a good concierge, Maria. I know I'm a good concierge, but for you, I know that deep inside - me or any other... ...is the same thing. Isn't it true? I'm leaving. I'll leave here my memories, maybe even my children. Here it is, Mrs. Reichert. I finished the dress that was your mother's. I hope you like it. Pedro hated these pants. Do you remember? Keep them. Perhaps they can fit the baby. The baby won't even know who we are. We'll be far way. He will be saying "grandma" to Mrs. Caillaux. We'll be only 2 hours away by plane. But I'll not be there when he's sick or to pick him up from the nursery. I'll be too far away. You'll be far away form those selfish people. Soon, we'll be in our home. And what will we do there, just us, lonely in that huge house? We'll live! Paula is right. We don't enjoy anything. We do nothing besides work. Maybe it's what we like. Don't you want to leave anymore? It's our home. Yes, I know. If you don't go, I will. All of my family abandons me. I'll go alone. -Shit! What? -I don't know. -I'm making an effort. I've no doubt. Portuguese suits you. I didn't know this place. Rosa took me here. -I'm more Portuguese than you. -Yes, so be it. What do you have in mind for us? A lot. Uncle, have you seen my dad? -I've searched everywhere. -What's going on? He was pissed. He left home and vanished. José disappeared. -What's goin' on, Rosa? -José disappeared! -What? -Come on, Francis! Action, reaction. Where is he? -Good night, Maria. -Madame Caillaux. I'm sorry, Maria! I'm sorry! I forgive you. Uncle, be careful. To José! Already now! What can we do? I won't be doing this all of my life. I hope you won't. You were right. We are Portuguese. We remain near our husbands until the grave. You left Portugal together. You should leave France together. Will you leave all of this, José? You've built many homes in your life, but you have only one family. NOTARY We are late. -I've been thinking. -Me too. -I'll stay with you. -I'll return with you. SIX MONTHS LATER Finally. Do you regret it? Don't worry! You'll have your 50 boxes as agreed. Okay? Look at your sister. She was made for this, we were not. I'm so happy that you're here! -Was the trip good? -Yes! -Good morning. -Good morning. -How's the baby? -Everything is fine. Everything okay, my little thing? It will be born here, thank God! TO MY PARENTS Oh, look! They arrived! Take care of the pan. I'll be right back... Come on, come on! They arrived. Come on, hurry up... Come on, children. They arrived, Pedro. Kids, the guests arrive - no playing here, did you hear me? Come on. Shit. Take off Pauleta's T-shirt. You don't deserve to wear it. Good morning. Who's the ball from? Good match. This is good. By the way, Maria, who's in charge of the building right now? Good morning. Thank you. Haven't you understood yet? I don't like football. What? You don't like football?! The only Portuguese who doesn't like football: my son! To the "Two Cods". To the "Two Cods". "The Two Cods" -Won't they ever change? -No. JCBP
