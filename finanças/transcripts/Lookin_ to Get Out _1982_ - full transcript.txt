I'll talk to you during the week, Jer. 'Bye, handsome.' 'I'm up to six packs a day, Lil.' She's a beauty. Ah-ha-ha. How much did you give her? I'd rather not talk about it. Nothing depressing today. I don't wanna talk about it either. I wanna talk about good things. Wonderful, magical, marvelous, magnificent things. Healthy things. 'I had a wonderful day, Jerry. A wonderful, unbelievable day.' Yesterday, how'd you do? With your old man? - We missed connections. - 'Hoo-hoo!' 'Don't worry about it, Jer. Magical, wonderful.' You ready for this? Wonderful day. I bumped into Yossi. Remember Yossi? Yossi? Yeah. Anyway, I get this tip from Yossi. - Yossi gives you a horse? - Yeah. How'd you do? I tied him up with two long shots and bought an exacta. That's bright. - Wait, what, what? - That's very bright. Jerry, what's your favorite drink? What the fuck you talkin' about now? What's your favorite drink? Dewar's, right? There's this first-time starter called Dewar's, Jerry. I couldn't believe it. You took a solid that Yossi gave you... You believe that? And I played him right on top. That's how I felt about it. What goes through your head when you do things like that? Why didn't you play him straight up? Jerry, I'm talking about a wonderful day here. - What... - About a marvelous day, here. Why didn't you put him straight up? Um, uh, wonderful, marvelous.. Would you listen to me? Did you win? Did you win an exacta? Would you let me tell the story? You won an exacta? Are you gonna let me tell the story, Jerry? - You won an exacta? - Holy shit! - Okay. - You won? Did you win? Fuck you, I won. You won. Why don't you let me finish the story, Jerry?

That's what you say when I win $15,000? What the fuck should I say? I want you to say. "Happy, happy. I'm happy." - "Hooray!" - Hooray! Dance up and down. Jump up and fuckin' down when I say $15,000. Where is it? I got the car out. So, I jumped down to Shotsie's. And I paid Harry the six, right? - I paid him off. - You paid Harry? - That's right! - The whole thing? - Yes! - The whole thing? Why are you questioning me? - Did I say "yes"? - The whole thing? Yes! I said "yes". I mean yes. - Well you're wonderful. - Say yes. I know that. You don't have to tell me I'm fucking wonderful. You're wonderful. You're beautiful. - You're beautiful. - So now I got close to 9 left. No. Nine... nine thousand. No. Close to Nine, Jerry. Because I paid 300 for the car. - And I gave Ziggy a tip. - Okay. - Were you playin' poker? - I was gettin' bad cards. Fuckin' Harry was needling me. I hate needlin'! Okay. The nine's gone. I couldn't see my.. I couldn't see the cards. I was so blind with fucking rage. - You lost the whole nine grand? - More. If I won one hand. I won a lot. - How much more? - Ten. You lost 10 grand? Okay. Okay. Okay. We owe Harry a thousand. - No, no, no, Jerry. - No? I told you I lost the nine, right? I think so. Well, I lost ten more. I lost ten more on top of the nine. I'm exhausted. I was up all night. I'm gonna get a nap. What's this? I told you to take the laundry in last week. What's the matter with you? Are you in a cloud? If you're gonna leave it on the floor leave it in front of your own fuckin' bed. Here. I'm hungry. Come on. Let's get something to eat. Stop worryin'. I'll get us out. Don't I always get us out? Yeah. For two weeks. Last July. Alex, Alex. Look what they did to the car. Jerry, things like that happen in New York every day. What're you gonna do? Worry about it? You gotta take the good with the bad here. Let's eat. What're you gonna get from a menu you don't know by heart already? You come here every day. Just think what you want and order it. - I can't concentrate. - I'll be back in a minute. - Take all the time you want. - Hold it. Verna. Listen, Jerry. Salami sandwich on rye. 'Orange juice. Large.

Look, your brain's in a knot. Here, relax your face. Relax, relax. All that in there. Just... attaboy, see? No wonder you can't concentrate. Relax your shoulders. Close your eyes. Relax your shoulders. Relax your arms. Relax them. Just let 'em fall like sides of beef. Look, just let them fall. That's it. Beautiful. You're very good at this. Think about something white. White, smooth and white. Big. Like the side of a.. ...boat. That's nice. 'Nice.' You're getting tension in your eyes. 'I feel the tension in your right, your-your lips.' 'Your lips are tense. What're you doin' with your fingers?' You see this? You don't listen to me. If you listen to me, you wouldn't be so.. Oh. Thought I was gonna get lucky and not have to see you till tomorrow. Today is tomorrow as of yesterday, sucker. I don't go by when the game ends. I can't make sense out of those words, Harry. You're talking with a limp. Look, motherfucker, at 7 o' clock tonight I'm gonna come by your place and I'm gonna ask real politely for my money. At which time, Alex will real politely give me my money. At which time I will not pour acid on his fucking face. You understand that, don't you, Alex? Either he pays or he pays. That's funny. That's cute. Hey, I like you. You're a cute little guy. Now, you understand, Alex? Huh? Tonight. - What's so fuckin' funny, Alex? - I don't know. Seven o'clock. Don't fuck up, Alex. How much money you got on you? - Not much. - Perfect. - We're going to Vegas. - Las Vegas? I don't know any other Vegas. I'll bring your other coffee when I get your order, Jer. 'Pay her, Jerry.

I have an appointment here. - Excuse me? - Excuse me. - Excuse me, gentlemen. - Excuse me. This is Jerry Feldman. Mr. Feldman. Yes? - We'd like our reservations. - Oh, boy. No, I'm sorry. I don't show a reservation for Mr. Feldman. - Gee, that's surprising. - Well, wait a minute now. - Is it under another name? - Another name? You're kidding. Bernie Gold made these reservations. Mr. Feldman's a personal friend of Bernie's. They talk to each other personally. I don't understand this. - Mr. Gold made the reservation? - Made the reservation. - Is he talking to me? - Oh, I don't know. - Was it recently made? - Was this recently made? About a week, right, Jer? About a week ago? A week. Seven days. There you go. We're supposed to have dinner with him tonight. 'His friend, Bernie.' Do you have anything on a comp slip for Mr. Feldman, please? 'I even turned down dinner on the plane.' - Yeah, you know how Bernie is. - Yeah. Bernie is Bernie. Once an asshole. Always an asshole. Feldman... Feldman.. Yes, I do. Full comp. Oh, incidentally he likes to go riding with the boss. Okay. Thank you. Well, I'm sure if Mr. Gold made arrangements to be here, he certainly will. In the meantime, let me make you as comfortable as possible. - That's wonderful. - Front please. What's your name? 'Jordon, sir. Alfred Jordon. That's it' - 'Alfred Jordon?' - 'Yes, sir.' 'There was a time.. Can I have the key?' 'I lost money in this place when there was no roof on it.' 'When this place was a convertible, I was losing here.' 'I used to know everybody here.' - 'Really?' - 'That's right.' They took care of me. I took care of them. - Really? - Well. 'First things first. I'll see you when we check out.' 'Thank you. Mr. Feldman, if there's anything you need' 'don't hesitate to ask.' 'Hey, you're welcome.' 'Will you take Mr. Feldman' 'to Dr. Zhivago Suite E, please?' - Are you Mr. Feldman? - Jerry Feldman and Alex Kovac. How are you? - May I see your key, please? - Sure. Thank you. Second suite on your left. Thank you very much. That's new money. Here it is! The Dr. Zhivago suite. Tell me, what is it like? Holy shit. It's.. This.. I think we better go. Good evening, Miss Warner. How are you tonight? Oh, hi. We're grown-up.. A-ah! 'You've asked for this for a long time.' 'Come, come. I'm just tryin' to make mincemeat of you.' I'm playing with you. I'm toying with you like a child. And now, I got you. I got you. - I got you... - No, you didn't. - I did. - You didn't. - And now the finishing touch. - No. - I'm telling you. I'm gonna... - No, wait. Oh. - It's a pool. - In the room. There's no broad in this pool. We have to make a list. Solve all these problems immediately. Otherwise I won't be able to sleep in my bed. In my bed, Jerry. I won't be able to sleep here. Ah... ah. Look! They gave you a mirror so you could watch yourself sleep. Isn't that wonderful? Oh, boy. This is where I lived, Geraldo. Fell in love. Lost a lot of money right out of this hotel. When you were married to Lillian. And I never even knew that a place like this existed. That's it. That's it. That's where we know Bernie Gold from. No. 'You know where we know Bernie Gold from?' The marquee... in front of the hotel. Bernie Gold presents Dean Martin. Remember that? Alex, what the fuck's gonna happen when they tell this Bernie Gold his great friend, Jerry Feldman is here? Let's not worry about that now. - Wait a minute. - How about now, maybe? Hello. Dom Perignon. Yes. Who's that? Some guy wants to know if there's any particular brand of champagne we would like. Compliments of the house. I wish you would've just told him at the desk that the doorman's your cousin. Rather than this Bernie Gold baloney. - What do you mean? - I mean, I'm.. I mean we're over our heads here. That's what I mean. Over our heads? It's the door. It's the door. Look, I'll get it. I'll get my hat and bags. Hello.. 'It's you.' Who's you? Who's her? Jerry, this is Patti. This is the Patti. - Jerry, Patti. - Patti, what a real pleasure. Nice meeting you, Jerry. You finally made the big win. Would you like a drink? Get her a drink. How do you know Bernie? Let's just say. Bernie knows us. What do you mean Bernie knows you? What do you mean? Look, forget it. You don't wanna know. It's a very complicated story. You are.. ...beautiful. Thank you. - What is this? - It's water. Would you like some ice with that? Thank you. Yeah, get her some ice. Saved by the bell. Excuse me. 'Hello.' 'Good to see you, gentlemen. Come on in.' 'Where would you like this, sir?' 'Put it on the coffee table. ' 'What happened to you guys? You both from the same ward?' Well, how about this, huh? Is this wonderful? Or is this wonderful? Look at this. Look. Here we go. Put it right there. We're having a party. We're having a party. - How long has it been, anyway? - Six years. Six years. What're you doing here, anyway? I work here. Doing very nicely at it too, I might add. How long has he been keeping you? Jesus. Oh, God. 'Hold it. Just a second. Hold it. Hold everything.' Hold it. I said something wrong, didn't I? Huh? She's a hooker. - I don't wanna say nothing now. - Look. I did something wrong, then you explain to me. Then maybe I'll apologize. What do you want? Excuse me, anything else, Miss Warner? - No, thank you. - How about the check? - No check, sir. - 'Then I can't give you a tip.' 'Wait here. Will you wait for a second?' Will you please wait for a second? Please, please, God. What's the matter you? You're just sittin' here listening. Pick up the phone. Hello, what've you got for us? Mister who Gold? Uh, it's..take it, will you? - What? - It's Bernie Gold. 'Talk to him.' No. I, what..you talk to him. You talk to him. Talk to him. What's he gonna do? Throw us out? Uh, probably the best thing that could happen to us. Yes, Mr. Feldman speaking. - We understand, sir. - I know you from someplace. - I don't think so, sir. - Yes. I do. Maybe I don't. I'm fine, Bern. How are you? Look, let's just be nice. You're a nice person. I'm a nice person. How 'bout that? 'Riding? That's great.' Glad you're having a good time. 'What the fuck?' Oh, I'm fine, uh.. - I guess I'll see you tomorrow. - You're too busy. Next week, Bern. - Yes. - Next week. Uh.. I'll see you tomorrow, Mr. Gold. No, not tomorrow. Next week. - Bernie! Bernie! Bernie! - Bernie. Jesus. What'd he say? Wants me to go over to his house for dinner and talk over old times. That'll be a hell of a conversation. What's going on? 'This guy thinks I'm someone else.' Yeah, what a break. What a wonderful break. Alex, he thinks he's a friend of mine. But he's not. Remember that? He is today. He's a wonderful friend. I'm crazy about this guy. 'And we're gonna live like kings till tomorrow, Jerry.' 'That's the way it's gonna go. What's that bad?' I can't believe this. I absolutely cannot believe this. 'How far do you think you're gonna take this, huh?' Huh. Yeah, how far? To the moon. That's how far. As far as I can. And I'm gonna take this one all the way. I'm not gonna let you do this. - You're not gonna let me? - 'No.' Who are you? 'Who are you? What're you talkin' about?' Who the hell do you think you are? 'You're not gonna let me.' Whoa, whoa, whoa. She's right. Right? Right? Right.. ...right, the waiter. I knew I saw that face before. - I gotta go. - Where you goin'? I've gotta talk to you. - I'll be back. - I wanna talk to you now. - Me too. - Me too? We will talk. I'll tell you what you do. Take Jerry downstairs to see that wonderful show downstairs. Have dinner, couple of drinks and later we'll talk our brains out. Get that frown off your face. Makes wrinkles all down your body. It would be very bad for business. Uh, maybe me and Patti, we'll stay here, rather than.. There's nothing to do here, Jerry. 'It's a great show.' 'You will make arrangements for Miss Warner.' It's always up to me. You know, if you're in a jam. He's probably the best guy to have around. Even though he probably put you in the jam to begin with. Do you think I'm too short? Too short for what? Smitty Carpenter. Smitty Carpenter, that's right. - Know where I can find him? - He's on his break right now. Where is that? Only employees are allowed in that area. That's what they all say. Honey, thank you very much. Have a nice day. Pardon me. Ice skaters have great bodies. Boy, oh, boy. I think it's my favorite show. It's terrific. 'Smitty Carpenter.' 'Smitty Carpenter.' Dr. Zhivago. What're you doing here? I'm a fan of yours. I'm a great admirer of yours, Smitty. I've seen you in action years back when you beat the Silver Slipper for a lot of bucks. Must have been, must have been $30,000. Thirty-two five and change. That was one of the great nights of my life. - Very graceful. - I know. There's so much going on. Maybe we better go back upstairs. Jerry. I never played the red board, all those bullshitters. Not me, those "Coulda, shoulda, woulda" guys. I was up front. I can look you in the eye right now. Ten years from now, I can look you in the eye. Straight, proud. You know what I mean? - Yeah. - Yeah. I started getting pressure in the head. But that's good. - You mean now? - Yeah, right now. It's in there. I can feel it. And you know something? That's when I knew I was gonna win. - I know what you mean. - You, yeah? - Sure. - You too? - I'm standing right here. - Yeah. Who do you think you're talking to? - Right. - We're the same animal. Yeah but, Jesus. I used to go crazy. I get a little sick. I'd bet on anything. You know what I mean? At parties, I'd bet on the hors d'oeuvres the lazy Susan, I mean, the raindrops, anything. - Me too. - I'm sick. - That's no good. That isn't. - I know. I know. Me too. I'm like that. And then I do bad things, you know. You know what I mean? Yeah, I'd hurt people. Oh, that's no good, to hurt people. You don't think I always walked like this, do you? Huh? - You're really terrific. - Thank you. You know, I know a lot about you and Alex. - You do? - Yep. Well, I know a lot about you and Alex too. He used to talk to you about me? A lot of times he would. Did he really use to talk to you about me? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. He used to call me from here, when I was married to Lillian. - And tell me about you. - Really? Yeah, but I'm not married anymore to her. Well, that's too bad. No, no, no, that's good. I'm not with Lillian. Is that alright? And you're not with Alex, right? And that's good. - Right. - See? Think positively. Don't look at the ground. Look at the sky. - Yeah? - Look at the sun. Look at the birds. Enjoy life. How much would it take to get you back into action? I'm talking about big action. - Did you miss me? - 'You missed the tiger.' I didn't miss nothin'. I missed you. 'Two elephants ran by like locomotives.' Didn't I tell you? Look at his face. Is he beautiful? - Yes, he is. - Just like a kiddie. Beautiful. Two elephants came by so close we thought they we're gonna crash the rail. Elephants-schmelephants. What about this? - Is this gorgeous or what? - What're you doing? Have I told you lately how beautiful you are? I think so, Alex. - So I'll tell you again. - Oh, good. Is that bad? Jerry, tell her it isn't. It's not bad. Remember the last time we were together? 'Yeah.' - Yeah. - Yeah. - Excuse me, Miss Warner. - Yes? Mr. Gold called and says he's coming in tonight instead of tomorrow. 'Oh, he said don't tell Mr. Feldman.' 'It's gonna be a surprise.' 'Oh, thank you.' What'd he say? - Bernie's coming. - No, no, no. It's a surprise. They're gonna surprise him. Let's go. Come on. What's the rush? I wanna watch the rest of the show. Don't argue with me. Don't argue with me. - 'We ain't got time. Come on.' - 'Don't talk to me that way.' You stay here. Just sign the check with Jerry's name. - 'I'll see you later.' - Well, wait a minute. Who do you think you're talking to? I'm talking to you. And leave a big tip. Come on. - Bye, Patti. - 'Come on. Come on.' Not just a waiter, believe me. Not just a waiter, Jerry. This is the guy that's gonna get us out. I'll call him from the Parisian Bar. Okay. You go ahead. - What happens if we lose? - If we lose? If we lose. We're gambling here, aren't we? If we lose, they get their money back. If we win, we pay 'em back. - What're you thinkin' about? - I don't know. - You don't know? - Ten thousand? Ten thousand, Jerry. Cash the check. Ten thousand. I'll be at the Parisian Bar. On the telephone. Cash the check. Yes, sir. Can I help you? Yes. I'd like to cash a check. Okay. Do you have any identification? Yes, uh.. I'm Jerry Feldman. A good friend of Bernie Gold. Oh, yes, I know all about it. You're all set. How much did you wanna cash? - Ten thousand. - Ten thousand? Do you have your own check with you? No. Now look, I left my checkbook. Sir, I'll let you sign a marker. I'll make this out for 10,000. I need to have you sign it right here, sir. 'We are ready to go, Smitty.' Did I wake you up? Did I wake you up? Well, it's gotta be soon. Because we're all set. I-I can come down and pick you up. There's 5000 in each one of these bands. That's 5,000. And that's 10,000. I don't, I don't have to, I don't think..

'Doctor? I'm in the... ' What's he gonna do, give our money away? Give the money away. - Give it away. - 'My friend cut himself.' 'It looks pretty bad.' 'I was just wondering if maybe you could' 'come up and take a look at it.' I'd really appreciate it. Thank you. You're lucky you got away from me when you did. 'Now you're happy.' Let me see that hand. I want you to know, you meant a lot to me. I just didn't have anything to give you. That's all. There, now I said it. So what? Hey, Harry, I'd like to straighten out our problem. Look, I'm sorry about what I said before. I'm sorry. I got.. I was upset. Coming here and findin' you with Jerry. He's got his pants down.

What's gonna spoil it? What's gonna spoil it? What're you talking about? You know what he's doin' now? He's givin' the money away to Harry. - 'What good is that gonna do?' - Who's Harry? Who's the father, Patti? Who's the father? Bernie Gold takes care of her. And as far as Tash is concerned.. ...that's her father. Good for you. Why do you wanna go in here? So we can have a little privacy. That's good thinking, Harry. You know, you ought to get rid of that creep Alex. You could do a lot better than that. Maybe. He's okay in my book. 'Okay. I killed better people then he'll ever be.' Come on, that's enough. What the fuck you touch.. Don't put your hands on me. 'I just didn't wanna hear anymore about Alex.' 'I don't give a fuck about Alex or you.' Okay, I changed my mind. I don't have the money. 'What do you mean? Give me that fuckin' money.' - No. - 'Give me the..' I got it. 'I got the money. I was kiddin'.' 'Harry.' - 'I got it in my pocket.' - 'A-ah!' Bernie is enjoying all this pressure as usual. How's Tash's cold? Oh, she's getting much better, thank you. Oh, good. She's a healthy little girl. She'll be over it in a couple of days. Give her a hug and a kiss from me. - I will. - Take care. You got lucky, young man. I know it's just a puncture but I'd still get that X-ray if I were you. Yeah, yeah. Where're you goin'? Where're you goin'? What're you doing? Oh, please. Please what? Please don't. Please what? Please... don't. 'I'll take care of the money with Bernie.' 'You just get outta here.' I don't know if I'm gonna do that. It'll be okay, I promise. He'll understand. Oh. Am I glad to see you. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, so sorry, Jerry. What happened? We're in big trouble. I did it. I can't believe I did it, but I did it. What, what did you do? What did I do? I kicked the shit out of Harry, that's what I did. - I must have gone crazy. - What about the money? 'What about the money, Jer?' I think I shoved some of it up his ass. Up his ass? 'How much?' - Not much, a hundred or two. - 'How much?' 'A hundred or two?' Jerry, you're beautiful. You are beautiful. - 'We're in trouble.' - 'We're still okay. 'Everything's alright.' - I'm not gonna talk about it. - Let's not even think about it. That's beautiful. Everything's okay. You gotta help us out. 'You gotta stall Bernie for some time.' 'I thought Bernie was coming tomorrow.' - Come on, let's go. - We're gonna go back out? - 'Yeah, you got the money?' - 'Yeah, but I lost my hat.' I'm not gonna help you. Bernie is gonna get every penny. I promise you that. Let's go. I'm not gonna help you. I gotta tell you, I never touched Patti. Oh. I never thought you did, Jerry. Yeah, I did. No, I didn't. I didn't touch Patti. Smitty, they're here. Smitty, you sweetheart. L know you can do it. Are you ready? Dr. Zhivago. You boys have a good time tonight. Hey, Alex, come on in. Make yourself comfortable. Smitty. Smitty, this is my friend and partner, Jerry Feldman. - Oh, hiya, Jerry. - Hi. L don't know which is worse, you know.. ...shaving every day or shaving every week. - This is where he lives? - Did you get the money? - Yep. - Oh, good. Don't judge a book by its cover. Hey, don't let this place fool you. You know there was a time when I was a legitimate citizen. Yeah, I was listed in the phone book. L was married, had a house.. You know I was, uh, once an engineer? Yeah. L built dams. - L didn't know that. - Yeah. L put all my mathematical knowledge together and put it into blackjack. Yeah, and, oh, it paid off. 'But listen, I'm a gambler.' 'Gamblers always wind up losing.' But I'm still the best one in this town. 'Yeah. I'm a gambler.' 'But listen..' Oh, shit. What's the matter? 'L lost my razor.' You lost your..here is your razor, here look, look, Smith. - Right there, see? - Oh, thanks. 'L don't see too well without my glasses.' Sometimes I think I need glasses myself. 'Remind me to call Lillian.' Why? Maybe we should talk about the split. - The split? - 'That's a good idea.' Well, I only work one way. Fifty-fifty. L.. Smitty, I got a partner here. 'It's gotta be a third each.' A third each? That's too tough for me. - Bad heart? - Yeah. How'd you know? Wild guess. Sixty-forty. That means you wind up with less. Oh. At least he hears good. We're takin' the biggest risk, putting up all the money. We're all taking a big risk here. One of you is gonna handle the bets. And the other is gonna handle the bank. - I'll handle the bets. - I'll handle the bank. Oh, that's good, that's good. That is good. Now, each stack represents a bet. I mean "A" is a hundred, "B" is 200, "C" is 500 and, and, four, "D" four is a thousand. 'Now, you see, so when I ask for, when I ask for "A"' 'you bet the first stack.' 'A hundred.' 'Look, when the odds are in our favor' 'you bet the third stack, 500.' You got that? How do we know when the odds are in our favor? 'What kinda question is that?' Look, it's a plus-minus situation. Plus-minus situation, Jerry. ' "A" is one, which could be ten.' ' "B" is two which, could be 20.' 'And "D" is four, which could be $ 100,000 bet.' We're gonna kill 'em. You know it. 'Hold it, hold it, we gotta go around the back.' 'What's this about around the back?' - Gotta go through the kitchen. - What do you mean, the kitchen? I'm not a waiter tonight. I'm going through the front door. Don't get lost. We'll see you in five. I'm glad he got out for our sake. Driver, around the back. 'Follow that cab.' 'Wait a minute. L got bags being put in the trunk.' 'I don't have to wait for your ass to meet your mouth.' 'You got it.' Jeff, block 1-11 tomorrow, forget next week. That's it for this guy. That's it, Nick, John. Mr. Gold, I tried to reach you on the radio. I know, the whole damn communication system went out on this thing after one damn telephone call. Didn't know the meeting was cancelled till we got there. L wanted to remind you about the Gaming Commission. Right, they want their answer tomorrow, they're gonna get it. 'Jeff, thanks a lot, men. See you in the morning.' Hey, what a nice surprise.

'Will you come on? You wanna die here?' No, no, you don't want to die here. 'Come on.' What have you got against Lillian? Wanna talk about that now, huh? Why not? She's a pain in the ass. Yeah, what else? What else? She's selfish, selfish, Jerry, she's selfish. That's it? She's a liar, she's, she's a sniveling, ugly woman. Like a piranha fish, she's a fish, Jerry. That's eating away at us. Nothing is open. That's all? No, it's your fault, because you.. 'You encourage her. So, what's the difference?' - As long as you're happy. - She's taking care of her kids. People shouldn't have kids if they're not responsible. They're not your kids. Kids are kids. No. Come on. Shit, the lion. How much do I really mean to you? Mmm-hmm. About that much. - Come on. - Well, what is this shit? Why do you ask a dumb question like that? Because I have to know. Don't you know? Good evening, Miss Warner. Mr. Gold, have you got a minute? Just about. Dean Martin's party is requesting six additional rooms for this evening. We're booked to capacity. What do you wanna do about it?

Yes, sir, I will. There's a couple things I wanna talk to you about. - Okay? - Okay. This is the stage. L saw somebody tonight that... l used to care a lot about, okay?

What, with a gun? - You fucker! - Oh! - You... - What's the matter with you? One man just died here. Isn't that good enough for you? - What's the matter with you? - Uh! - Stop fooling around. - My eye! - Come on. Watch it. - You're gonna hurt him. - Alex. What's the matter. - He hit me in the eye! - I know that. - Come on, buddy. This man is a total complete fuck up! What are you.. How the hell..What.. He's not always been like.. Son of a bitch. - Hey, come on now. Watch it. - Careful. Be careful. You watch your step. - Why did you do that? - Because you're fucking... - 'Stop it!' - 'Alex.' 'Watch this shit, Alex.' Alex, watch this shit. 'Stop it!' - 'Jesus Christ.' - My God. He's at it again. Don't touch him. - Tricia. - Animals! - Shit. - What the hell are you doing? I don't know. It just went off. - It just went off? - Yes, sir. - Sonny.. - I'm sorry. - Just take a walk. - Idiot. - Relax, take it easy. Uh.. - Yes, sir. It's okay. It's all over. 'Just take it easy. Relax. It's all over.' 'Like to apologize for the inconvenience' 'and wish you all the best of luck. Et cetera.' Please continue your game. Have fun. Hey, fellas.. ...ease up. I'd like to get a couple of things straight here. - Who are you two maniacs? - Maniacs? They're just some guys we owe some money to. Get these two guys on the first plane to anywhere. Just get 'em out of my sight. I don't ever wanna see you two guys. Don't ever come back here again. - Hey. - Give my hat. You're happy, are you Alex, huh? Give this to him. Tell him to put it away, sonny. Okay, now the way I see it. You owe me 20000 bucks. What are you talking about? What's he talking about? Well, I'm willing to give you a break. Look. Mr. Gold.. ...just give us what we won, take out whatever you want. How about that? Let's get this straight. You didn't win anything. 'The only man who won here is the waiter and he's dead.' That money goes on ice. It's frozen till the courts decide. - That's my money. - That's the law! Because you own a hotel, doesn't mean you can push people around. 'You ought to be in jail. I'm trying to save your ass here.' - I've got it under control! - We won that money. - 'I've got it under control.' - We won that money. - The waiter won that money. - We won that money! Smitty Carpenter's the greatest gambler the world has ever seen. And he won that money for me. I don't believe you. Can't you understand it isn't your money? You people are all wrong. You're stealing from a dead person. - Everything you say is wrong. - Alex. - Everything you say is wrong. - I gotta talk to you. I don't wanna talk. I want my money. Just listen to one thing. Patricia has a little girl. 'Her name is Tash.' 'She's your daughter.' It's your little girl. What's that supposed to mean? I want my money. Don't think I'm gonna make things any easier. - Work it out on your own... - L don't want help. - L want my money. - You're not getting it. Smitty won that money for me, Did he win that for me or what? - I can't deal with this guy. - He won the money for me. - Jerry. - Alex. Please listen to me. - I don't wanna talk. - Jerry. - Please listen to me. - I don't wanna talk to you! I don't wanna talk to.. Please, Jerry. He's trying to understand you. And he's been extremely kind. - For once in your life, please. - He's never gonna understand. - 'Cause he ain't really trying. - He's trying, Jerry. Mr. Gold, I don't want your money. And unfortunately he does but that's the way he is and, uh, I can't help that. He's my friend and I take the good with the bad. I think we should get outta here, Alex. How about that? You gotta know who your friends are. Hi. About the money, It'd be better for both of us if I gave you some cash in the morning. Don't worry about it. Your friend took care of everything. - He's really a sweet guy. - He did? How do I get out of here? Thank you. Bye. I gotta thank you, Alex. That was the greatest thing. Forget it. Alex, what do you say we stay over a couple of days? You know, that girl liked me. I mean really liked me. We're leaving in the morning, Jerry. - Is something the matter? - Where'd you get the money? What money? The money for the broad. I'm a resourceful human. Do I have to tell you everything? - Did you cash another check? - No. I did not. You shoulda. Bernie would've covered it. He woulda covered it. Son of a bitch woulda covered anything. Well, that wouldn't be right. Good night, Alex. Honey, this is a very good friend of mine, Mr. Kovac. And over here is Mr. Feldman. - This is Tasha. - Hi, baby. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm okay. You know what happened to me? I was crossin' against the light. You don't wanna ever do that. You don't wanna ever cross against the light. Remember that. - Where are you from, honey? - Las Vegas, Nevada. Las Vegas. Nevada? You know where I'm from, me and Jerry? We're from New York City. Hear that siren? They have a lot of sirens like that in New York. Noise all the time. That's why they have tall buildings in New York City. Daddy goes there all the time. Daddy goes there. Huh? Your daddy's a.. - He's a nice man. - You are too. I'm gonna get a cab. Taxi? - Can I go play with my teddy? - You sure can. Goodbye, Patti. You should marry that guy. He's loaded, you know. Okay. That guy was wearing my fuckin' hat. Come here. Another one. Another one. Okay. You know that was some move you made when Harry had his gun out. That's nothing like the move Smitty made. Doubling down on a solid 20? Guy's got a six showing. You see Smitty's face when he got the five? How'd he know? How did he know that was a five coming up? How did he know? He knew. That was the old plus-and-minus situation. My name is Smitty Carpenter. You owe me $500,000. 'One moment please.' John, the figure is 486-3. Not the half. Okay. Will you get your head out of there? 'Would you like a security guard to escort you out? It's alright. No, thank you. Las Vegas is a lot of fun. Isn't it? Goodbye, we're going. Goodbye, Las Vegas. - Hello, boys. - You did it. You did it. Here. Here you are, my friend. Don't spend it all in one place. I didn't think it was this much. God bless you. God bless you. Have a good time. Let's go to Connecticut. ?
