[English subtitles are available] [Kill one person in ten steps. No one can escape.] [The rebellion during the Tianbao years of the Tang Dynasty made the Tang dynasty decline rapidly.] [After seven years, the rebellion ended.] [But there was no etiquette or law. The Tang dynasty is not prosperous anymore.] Blind, you have won so much money from the gambling house. Why are you still here? Let's make a big bet. If you win, the money on the table will be doubled. If you lose, you will have to cut your hand. The left hand or the right hand? Is this blind OK? Blind, you lost. It's all white. With so many people watching, you bullied me, a blind man. I'm the banker here. I have the final say. Guards! Chop off his hand. How dare you! Master, he... You are not as good as him, so you cheated. If others are all like you, how can I run this gambling house? Sir, I apologize on behalf of these stupid men. Please continue playing. No matter how much you win, we'll pay for it. Are you the owner? I'm He Qiufeng. -This gambling house... -I've had enough fun. Bye. Are you from the gambling house? The owner is here too. What do you want? Blind, no matter how much you win, it is your money only when you can take it away. Got it. It's dark, and the road is dangerous. It is easy to kill people in rainy nights. Where is Ni Yan? [BLIND SWORD] Blind Cheng is a ghostkiller. [One month ago] The world was in turmoil a few years ago. All provinces set up rewards [Liangcheng] to invite people from all over the world to arrest criminals. A ghostkiller, according to its name, trades his life for money. My name is Ni Yan. I met Blind Cheng when I was 19. How dare you steal the wine? Ni Yan, I am sorry. I'm sorry, Ni Yan. Go pick up Wulang. Let's go pick him up. Let's go. Come back. After you eat my dessert, you will have to be my family. Okay? Okay. Okay. Go play. Let's go pick up Wulang. Old man, are you calling me? Old man? Do I look like an old man to you? You're even more blind than me. The wine smells good. Is it made of grapes? You have a sensitive nose. It has been 81 days. I opened it today. Go fill my bottle. How much is it? It's not for sale. Today is my wedding day. I prepared the wine for the guests. It's a waste of wine. If you want to drink some, stay a little longer. We have enough wedding wine. It's free. Really? I see. I'm not your relative or friend. I won't drink it for free. This money is my gift. Go. Tie the horse for me. No need for the gift. You are here to congratulate me. You should say something auspicious. How about I kowtow to you? You don't talk if you don't embarrass others. You are the same as my brother. Sit there. I'll add some fodder for your horse. Don't feed it. My horse eats meat rather than grass. Don't be afraid. There is a person inside. Who is he? He is an arsonist. I'm the ghostkiller of Dali Temple. I caught him to get the reward. [Wanted] We will pick up the bride. Congratulations, Wulang. Come to my wedding! Congratulations, Wulang. Thank you. Congratulations. Congratulations! Congratulations. Come to our wedding party later. Congratulations, Wulang. Thank you. Come to my wedding. Guys, come to the wedding. Brother. Brother, you have received my letter. Why are you in such a hurry to get married? Can't you live without a man? Wulang is nice. He's diligent, and he is nice to me. Wulang, this is my brother. Brother, from now on, I will take care of Yanzi. Boy, go ask around. I kill people easily outside. If anyone dares to bully my sister, I'll kill him. Stand up. Stand up. Folks, today is my sister's wedding. I'll pour you some wine later. Have a seat. Yanzi, we've had the wedding wine. It's not easy for you and your brother to reunite. I won't disturb you. Goodbye. Folks! -Everyone! -Look. It's all your fault. Don't care about them. Who are you? They are all gone. Why are you still here? Didn't you hear that they said I was a jerk? I do bad things all the time outside. Your knife is too sharp. Don't hurt yourself. Drink it. It's wedding wine. The wine is good, but the happiness has nothing to do with us. Wine seller. Girl. Brother. Brother. [Four hours ago] Let go of me! Ni, why did you run away while you are in charge of such an important thing? When the coffin was opened, you killed everyone. If I didn't run, I would have to die too. Why can't you die? I can die, as long as... as long as you let my sister and others go. I won't tell anyone about those things, and no one will know about them. Only the dead won't say anything. Wulang! Bastard, don't touch her! Brother. Yanzi, run! Brother. Yanzi, I shouldn't have come back. Don't move. You're not strangled to death because your neck is tough. Everyone has their own fate. You're luckier than them. Officer Gao. Officer Gao. Have some water. Don't bother. It rained heavily last night. There are three families waiting for us. Without you, I wouldn't know what to do. My lord. What are you doing? This man is an arsonist recorded by 18 towns of Changzhou. The Ministry of Punishments offered a reward of ten taels of gold. The criminal is here. I'm the ghostkiller of Dali Temple. This is the reward. The ghostkiller? Do we still have ghostkillers now? He's blind. What's wrong with him? I am afraid that he may run away, so I broke his arms and legs. Get him a doctor. It's written clearly. He is a felon. It is accepted even if I take his head here. No matter whether you kill him or punish him, do whatever you want. I want to ask you something. Which one of you is Zhang Baishui? Is it him? Yes. Li Jiuzhou, do you think you can escape? What's going on? Blind, take the reward and leave. It's done. By the way, the family selling wine in the west of the city was killed. Are you in charge of this? My lord, the Yuwen family did it. What should we do? [Yuwen] Girl, you suffered a lot. When are you going to Luoyang to arrest the criminal? I'll bury them for you. Let... let it go. What did you say? A life for a life. I just want justice. I can't give you justice this time. I've lived here for so many years. Now I realized that this is a place where there is no law. If you can't give me justice, I'll find someone who can give it to me. Girl, on your wedding day, Ni Jun made trouble here. Your husband, Li Wulang, died because he protected you. You killed your brother because you were angry. Am I right? No. -Everyone in Liangcheng knows -Nonsense! Ni Jun is that kind of person. They believe whatever I say. I won't admit it. Don't move. -Admit it sooner and you won't suffer. -Let go of me! Let go of me! We both know what happened. She's already miserable enough. There's no need to destroy her. What did you say? I don't understand. I have good hearing. It's none of your business. Let's go. Blind, you'd better not get involved in this mess. You should not stay here. Leave. You're a master. I'll pay you. Kill them for me. No. I'm a ghostkiller, not a killer. I want to go to Luoyang too. Take me with you. Why are you going to Luoyang? Report to the government? If the officials in Liangcheng can't solve my problem, I'll go to Luoyang. If the officials in Luoyang can't solve my problem, I'll go to Chang'an. It has nothing to do with me. Take me with you. I just want justice. Take her with you. Blind, do you have family? Drink it while it's hot. Don't catch a cold. My brother said every time I play the reed pipe, I am talking to my dead family. But it's broken too. Give it to me. Don't believe it. [Luoyang] Here, two bowls of beef noodles in soup. Enjoy. Did you remember what I said? Yes. Repeat it. There is an open yard at the end of the east market. There is a Dengwen Drum at the door. If I stand on the Feiming Stone and beat the drum, someone will help me. Thank you for the past few days. I have to go now. Luoyang is big. Don't get lost. I may not make liquor anymore. -You know liquor. Keep it. -Buddy, is the beef fresh? Of course. I raised it myself. Please have a seat. Okay, two bowls. Okay. Welcome to come again. Lady Qin. Lady Qin. Lady Qin. Lady Qin. Lady Qin. Lady Qin. I made another poem for you. -I'll read it to you. -Lady Qin. Your zither is fixed. Come and pick it up when you're free. No hurry. Lady Qin. Lady Qin, wait for me! You're not Li Bai, nor am I Yang Yuhuan. We're not meant to be. Lady Qin. Lady Qin. Lady Qin. Put it down. I just tuned it. Your rough hands may make it out of tune. Is everything going well in Liangcheng? He is right. Li Jiuzhou is hiding in the county office in Liangcheng. You arranged it well. Here. The payment is in. The next deal is a big one. When? I've sent someone to explore the way. I guess we'll leave in three days. Anything wrong? Nothing. Remember to feed the horse for me. Okay. Blind, we have news. The fugitive is well connected in Yanzhou. It might be very difficult. But the good thing is that the pay is high. Including this, we'll have enough money for your eyes. This is the last deal. Do you think that doctor can really cure my eyes? Of course. He's my grandmaster's senior. If he doesn't know me, he'll ask for 3,000 more. Stop nagging about this. What do you want to do the most when your eyes are cured? I want to see you first. After all these years, I'm afraid you look old now. Stay blind then. Alright, I'm leaving. Slow down. Lady Qin. Lady Qin. Sanlang? What happened? That bitch! If she falls into my hands, I'll kill her. Who offended you? Didn't you say that you had a job at Yuwen's? How could you be bullied? Don't mention it. What bad luck! Today at Shouhua Mansion, Yuwen Xiong sent wedding gifts to the third daughter of the Guo family. What an important occasion! Out of nowhere, a woman came in. Who knows how Yuwen Ying offended her? It was a big mess. Of course, Yuwen Ying wants to deal with it as soon as possible. But General Guo said not today. Take her away and keep an eye on her. I'll personally ask about this in a few days. So, I can't kill this woman. It's so annoying. And then? Yuwen Ying asked He Qiufeng to take her away. He's a bad guy. If anyone falls into his hands, nothing good will come of it. Who is she? She's probably Yuwen Ying's lover. She's quite pretty. But she looks like a whore. Get lost! It hurts. It's ready. Blind, leave it to me. In the past, you did not want to get involved. I didn't tell you either. But now I have to tell you we can't afford to offend the Yuwen family. Why? The Yuwen family is an underground gang in Luoyang. They helped the court during the rebellion. They have clan powers in Hedong, Shannanxi and Longyou. The marriage with General Guo's family is for entering Chang'an. Yuwen Ying is Yuwen Xiong's brother. If you affend him, then you'll affend the Yuwen family. What do your words have to do with killing for revenge? A life for a life. You don't need to kill 10,000 people. Don't you understand that? More tea, please. Help yourself. I don't care. You should go. Leave now. What do you think, buddy? I'll listen to you. Let's go back and see. Where is Ni Yan? I don't know. In the Dead Man's Place. In the Dead Man's Place. Miss. Miss. Are you there? They forced me to admit the things I didn't do. She won't die, but needs rest. There is no time to rest. Pack up. I'll send you out of the city at dawn. From now on, you don't know me. We're not friends either. I'm sorry for dragging you into this. It's a done deal. We can go together. I have other things to do. Yi, I can't let you have your way this time. You must come with me. My eyes... can't be cured, right? I know, you want to give me some hope to live for. You mean well. Yes. I lied to you. I want you to be blind forever. I want to be blind like you. Nothing in this world is worth seeing and no one is worth it. She's not worth it either. Look at her. Is she pretty? What did you say? I'm asking you whether she is pretty? I can't see. I only know that she suffered so much. She just wants justice. I'll give it to her. Justice? Over the years, we have seen a lot of unfair things. Can you undo them all? Let's start with her. I can't see with my eyes, but I can see with my heart. All right. Let's stop here. Leave now. Are you really going back? Consider me get lost. Tell her that I'll avenge her. Off you go, buddy. Don't move. The more you struggle, the more it hurts. Do you know who I am? He Qiufeng. Your ancestors were thieves from Luonan for three generations. Because you are ruthless, Yuwen Ying got you out of prison. Who are you? It's my turn to ask you. Why did you kill that man from the Ni family? What happened with that woman? I'll tell you everything. Can you spare my life? I'm asking the questions. You just answer me. Miss Guo. Miss Guo wants the stars in the sky. So Yuwen Ying gave her a luminous pearl. It was dug out from the tomb of a Han dynasty lord. It's such a big pearl. How can we have it if we don't dig the grave of the dead? For fear of feeling bad luck for the Guo family, Yuwen Ying killed everyone who dug the tomb. Ni Jun was a supervisor. He ran away. We had to catch him. Ying. I didn't expect that a loser like you can win Miss Guo's favor. However, you're just like your mother. All you know is steal. I'll leave steal behind. Why didn't you clean it up? Leave it to me. I'll take care of it. Where is General Guo? What do you want? I can take you there. Yuwen Xiong...Yuwen Xiong... Yuwen Xiong booked the Mingyue Tavern for him. Yuwen Xiong... Be gentle. Where is He Qiufeng? He was taken away by a blind man. A blind man? I've never seen such a powerful blind man. I seem to know such a blind man. Right here. What a cruel blind man. After leaving the posthouse, you'll reach the Eastern Pass after walking 20 miles south. My men are waiting for you there. What kind of person is he? He's a poor man just like us. Then why did he help me? Maybe he doesn't want you to end up like him. Are you going back? The Yuwen family will catch up soon. Keep heading south. Don't look back. Blind killed He Qiufeng to declare war against me. He must still be in the city. Ambush all around the city. Besides, the woman with pipa can't go far while carrying someone. Chase her along the way. Find them at all costs. Got it. [Full] Don't go in if you're not stupid. Here's full. I'm looking for the boss. I am the boss. I'm looking for their boss. Tell me, who are you looking for? General Guo. General Guo is not here. Where is Blind now? Why are you laughing? I'm laughing at you for being dead. Really? You just want to know who the Blind is? I can tell you. Back in Suiyang, Blind was called Cheng Yi. A pair of hands that could split muscles, a Tingfeng Sword, and Loulan cut. It's you who woke the jinx. I'm Cheng Yi from the Dongshan Wolf Battalion. I met you once in Dongjing Pass. I'm not here to cling to you. I have a few words for you. Do you know what kind of person is Yuwen Ying, the man who will marry your daughter? Blind showed up. Where? Mingyue Tavern. You have no evidence. Why should I believe you? I will kill him. Believe it or not, it's up to you. General has ordered to break off the engagement. General specifically ordered to reward you. I've worked hard for ten years. But I lost everything all of a sudden. Useless! Stop hitting! Useless! Who is that? It's really Lady Qin. Who did this? Your zither is fixed. Come and get it when you have time. [Memorial Tablet of Late Brother Yuwen Xiong] [Yuwen Family] When my eldest brother died, he ordered me to be the head of the family. After the mourning tonight, anyone who kills the enemy of our family will be added in our genealogy and rewarded one hundred fiefs and ten thousand gold. The Yuwen family searched the whole city for you. No one dared to touch her body. In the end, Wuhou sent someone to get it back. Her body cann't be recognized. 13 arrows. Each one shot through the bones. Got it. Blind, are you still playing? I'll send you to hell. I will definitely go to hell. But I have to take you with me. I have killed many people like you on the battlefield. You are just the same as them. You're here. Yes. You drank too? What else did he say? He said find a good place, open a tavern and make some good wine. If there's a chance, I'd like to have two more drinks. Alright, that's it. Blind has been killing for someone for ten years. He saved up 9,150 taels of gold. He said it was useless so he asked me to change them into cash and give you. It's convenient to carry around. Also, your Hujia is fixed. Keep it. Blind is a ghostkiller. The world was in turmoil a few years ago. All provinces set up rewards to attract men all over the world to arrest criminals. Ghostkiller. Just like the name, he does his job with sword and earn money with his life When I met Blind that year, I was 19 years old. [After everything is done, I'm still hiding my name.]
