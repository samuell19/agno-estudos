The challenger, local kung fu favorite, Jack Tanaka. (cheers and applause) And the champion, Dewey "The Black Cobra" Cooper! (cheers and applause) (upbeat techno music) (grunting and smacking) (audience cheering) (grunting and smacking) (loudly smacks) (loudly grunts) (audience loudly gasps) (audience cheering) (grunting and smacking) (cheers and applause) - Hi, Dad. - Hi, son. You were good tonight, but a little off. - Thanks, Eric. Where's Brad? - Son, Brad did not want to come. (soft piano music) Oh, uh, there's a lovely young lady I brought that I want you to meet, I think you'll both-- - I'm just not ready to meet anybody. I'm just not ready. - Alright. (ominous music) (softly beeping) (ominous music) - I'm goin' in. (ominous music) (shoes softly clattering) (ominous music) (softly fluttering) What was that? - [Dr. Tanaka] A moth, your avian aspect was set too high. - I'm pickin' up several targets. - [Dr. Tanaka] Move in. (ominous music) - Feels like a trap. (ominous music) (shoes softly clattering) (dramatic music) - [Fighter] Hyah! (loudly grunting) (loudly smacking) (dramatic music) (loudly grunting) (loudly smacking) (dramatic music) (loudly grunting) (loudly smacking) (dramatic music) (loudly smacks) (loudly grunting) (bone cracking) (loudly grunts) (dramatic music) (loudly grunting) (loudly smacking) (dramatic music) (loudly smacking) (softly grunts) (loudly thuds) (ominous music) - My family's got money, please, don't kill me. Please, don't, no-- (dramatic music) (groans) (softly swishing) - Hey, (softly beeping) (softly clicking) Why'd you turn off the program? I almost had him. - Everything is fine, Dean. However, the hostage is dead. - Oh. It's a good thing it was a simulation. - Uh, it's much more than that. We're trying to make the simulation as real as possible. - I see you killed the hostage again. - Well, you know? I keep screwin' up just so I can come back and see you. - But you're still not good with computers. - I, I just can't put my faith in this new technology. I don't have a PHD in computer science like you. - Well, Professor Tanaka has four. So, I think you're in good hands. - That's right, Dean. This new program that we've developed is so advanced that soon, most of your training will be done here in the lab facing computer-generated opponents. - Come on, you can't replace real opponents or real targets. - I wouldn't be too sure of that. These computer-generated fighters have been programmed to respond, adapt, and learn any movement they can encounter. You know, pretty soon, they might be able to think on their own. - I'll believe that when I see it. - Dean, this program is going to prepare you for the ultimate confrontation, whether it be a street punk, or fighter, or terrorist. It could save your life. - You're probably right, Doc. I guess I'm still just a little old fashioned. - There's a lot to be said about being old fashioned, that's good. But I believe that eventually, the man, and not the machine, can ultimately make the difference. - Isn't that what I was saying? - Here, (chuckles) go clean yourself up. (chuckling) - Doin' anything tonight? - Yeah, I'm studying for my second PHD. - Great. (computers beeping and buzzing) - Hyah! (whipping) Hiyah! (whipping) (soft drums) (robes rustling) - Yeah, that's good, good stand there, there you go. Good. Class, over here, right. (loudly grunts) (softly smacking) (softly whipping) (softly thuds) Okay, class, remember, relax as you go through your moves. Because when you tense up, you're fighting two people, yourself and your opponent. Everybody understand? Okay, ceremonial bow, hyah! (gong softly clashes) Class dismissed. (kids softly chattering) (soft orchestral music) (upbeat hip hop music) * Shake what your mama gave ya * Come on, shake what your mama gave ya * Shake what your mama gave ya * Your booty 'cause it take nine months to make * When I go inside the club the party was on * Everybody shake, shakin' til the break of dawn (upbeat hip hop music) (chattering drowns out lyrics) * Shake what your mama gave ya * Shake what your mama gave ya * Shake what your mama gave ya (computers buzzing and beeping) - You still workin' on the game? - Oh, hi, Sally, I'm almost through. Well, just a few more tweaks and adjustments and Sci-Fighter will be completed. - Sci-Fighter. I like it, how'd you come up with that one? - I think it's the perfect name, Sci-Fighter, when modern science meets the ancient art of self defense. I think Brad's gonna love it. (computers buzzing and beeping) - Not if you're late for his birthday party. - Oh. (soft music) Oh, geez, I, I always lose track of time. - It's past nine. - I've got to get going. Sally, oh, please, will you shut off the computer and pack the game up for me, please? - Go get ready. - Alright, okay. - I'll take care of everything. (computers buzzing and beeping) (upbeat music) (people loudly chattering) (computers buzzing and beeping) - Well, Sally, how do I look? - [Sally] You look great. (heavy bass music) (car rustling) (upbeat techno music) (car lock beeps) (upbeat techno music) (people loudly chattering) - Relax. - How am I supposed to relax? We got all these people here, my dad's gonna kill me. (people chattering) (dog softly barks) (muffled techno music) - Well, since it's your birthday, I got you a really special present. Here, careful with it, don't get it wet. - How'd you get these? Concert tickets this Friday! Thank you. - Happy Birthday. You want some? - You know I don't drink. (people chattering) (upbeat techno music) - Come on, just one sip. (people chattering) (upbeat techno music) - Brad. Brad! - Mr. Tanaka, I'm so-- - Don't waste your time. - Brad is-- - Don't waste your time. - I want everybody out of here now. (people chattering) (upbeat techno music) (soft music) (computers buzzing and beeping) (softly clicking) - Does this look okay to you? (computers buzzing and beeping) - Looks good, except for this code. It's a fragment. - Oh, I missed that. - Good job though. - Thanks. (computers buzzing and beeping) Hey, I heard you met Dr. Tanaka's son, is he hot? - (sighs) Well, I haven't really met him. But I saw him fight, and he looks really, really cute. (computers buzzing and beeping) - [Teenage Boy's Voice] Great night, Brad, see ya. (door slams) (soft piano music) - Brad, Brad! Sit down, I wanna talk to you. (soft piano music) Sit down! What's gotten into you lately? - This gonna take long? - Answer me, Brad. Look, I know there's a problem, I wanna know what it is. (soft piano music) - You won't understand. - Try me. (soft piano music) Okay. Go to your room. You're grounded for a week. - [Brad] Whatever. (soft piano music) (sighs) Damn. (soft piano music) (keypad beeping) (phone ringing) - Hello? - [Brad] Yeah, hi, Jess? - Hey, Brad! Ugh, I'm so sorry about getting you into trouble tonight. - Don't worry about it, he was being a jerk. It's not your fault. - Yeah, but, I know that beer didn't help. So, um, aren't you excited about the concert this weekend? - Um, actually, that's why I called you. - [Jess] Yeah, what do you mean? - I can't go, I'm grounded. - Well, we can sneak out. - I would, but, he took the tickets. - You let him take the tickets? Brad, I've been saving up for those tickets for the past six months. - I know, I'm sorry. I wish there was something that I can do. - Alright, alright, don't worry about it, I'll figure something out. - You promise? - Yeah, I promise. You're not still mad at me, are you? - No. - [Brad] Alright, I'll see you in school, alright, babe? - Alright. - [Brad] Good night. - Bye. (phone beeps off) (knocking) (soft piano music) - Come in. (door clatters) - Happy birthday. (paper crinkling) I got you a new kung fu uniform. - Great. (exhales) You know, Brad, you were gonna come back to class tonight. - It's my birthday, I should be able to do what I want. - Skipping class is one thing, but what are you doing throwing a party without asking permission? - It's my house too, you know. - Kung fu is not just a sport. It's a way of life. And if you would dedicate yourself just a little bit, your grades might improve too. - Thanks for the gift, Dad. (soft piano music) (door clatters) (soft piano music) (door clatters) - Hello! Hi, Jack. - Hi, Dad, you're late. - You know, I got carried away at the lab, son, I'm sorry. The party's over, what's going on? - Brad missed class again. And he threw this party, didn't even tell me about it. - [Dr. Tanaka] So, son? It's his birthday. - I caught him with a beer tonight. I mean, no wonder his grades are slipping. - Jack, I meant to talk to you about Brad. You know, lately, he's been a little rebellious and acting out, but growing up is a hard thing to do, son, especially when you lose your mother at such an early age. That can be devastating. So, try to be patient with Brad, please? - You don't understand, Dad, kids are different today. - (lightly laughing) They're not that different. You remember you when you were younger? You used to sneak out and try to see your girlfriend. (laughing) You used to give me a lot of trouble too, you know. I don't wish to dishonor or disrespect the love and the feeling you had for Stephanie. But son, I know it's been painful. The reason I wanted you to meet Sally was because she's a decent woman, she's in intelligent. Now, will you meet her? - [Jack] Okay, I'll meet her. - When? - Soon, just go give Brad his gift. - Alright, um, you know, I have an idea. Why don't we set it up here and give him a surprise. Okay? Oh, that's good. (softly humming) (soft piano music) (knocking) - What do you want now? (knocking) What? (door clatters) - Brad. (chuckling) That's a hell of a way to treat your grandfather. - [Brad] How you doin', Grandpa? - Eh, I'm doin' alright, I'm doin' alright. How you feeling? - [Brad] Alright. (basketball rustling) (soft piano music) - I got something for you. - [Brad] What is it? - Oh, it's something I made specially for you. It's a video game, it's called, Sci-Fighter. - Sci-Fighter? - Yes. Eh, come on, come on, I set it up in the living room. Come on, go ahead, right now. (soft music) It's gonna be alright, Jack. (soft piano music) It's gonna be alright, Jack, come on, come on. (soft piano music) (door clatters) Brad, put it in, come on! (game buzzing and beeping) - You sure this thing's safe? - Jack, of course it's safe, nothing wrong with it. (clattering) (game buzzing and beeping) It's cool, right? (chuckling) (buzzing and beeping) (upbeat techno music) - Hi, you must be Brad. - Yeah, who are you? - Veronica. - Nice graphics. - Let's see what suits you. (upbeat techno music) (game buzzing and beeping) - Cool. (game buzzing and beeping) - What's he doing in there? - Oh, he's trying different uniforms on. - What kind of game is this? - It's a hand-to-hand combat training simulator with artificial intelligence that can adapt and adjust itself to its opponent's strengths and weaknesses and provide maximum challenge. By the way, I used real people as models to play the computer-generated fighters. Come on, come on, Jack, give it a try, go ahead. - I don't think so. - You said you wanted to be close to Brad. The family that plays together stays together. - A video game? - Yes, a video game. Come on. (light techno music) Jack, I designed this game for the both of you. So that you can connect, this is an opportunity. - I don't see how this is gonna help. - Come on, come on, no ands or buts now. Everything is not what it appears to be, okay? (light techno music) - Jack, I'm so glad you made it! - You know me? - Only what Dr. Tanaka told me. I was so looking forward to meeting you in person. You're much more handsome than I'd imagined. - Thanks. Dad, I'm sure you're enjoying this. (muffled techno music) - Maybe you'd look good in a Shaolin monk's outfit. (gong clashes) - Don't think so. Orange is definitely not my color. (upbeat techno music) (softly beeping) - [Veronica] That's it, a superhero costume. - No! What is your name? - [Veronica] Veronica. (laughing) - Veronica, get this off me. (beeping) - You're a tough one to please. Okay, how 'bout something simple like this? - That's cool. (light techno music) - This will do. - Then you're ready to go. (swishing and beeping) Step to the podium and make your way to the first level of the game. - Thanks. - Yeah. - And Jack, come back and see me sometime. (upbeat techno music) Good luck, guys. (swishing and beeping) (gong softly crashes) (whipping and beeping) (tranquil music) - Ahh! I am the karate master. If you are prepared for battle, we can begin. (shoes clattering) Choose your skill level. - Skill level? - Yes, are you master or beginner? - Master. - You better make it beginner, Brad. - Chill out, Dad, it's just a game. - You have chosen. (grunts) (grunting and smacking) (loudly whips) (grunts) (grunting and smacking) (loudly smacks) (loudly grunts) (loudly whips) - Brad, you okay? - Yeah, I'm cool, kick his ass, Dad. - Time to give you a taste of reality. (ominous music) (knuckles cracking) (loudly smacking) (dramatic music) (whipping and smacking) (loudly grunting) (loudly smacks) (dramatic music) (loudly smacks) (loudly grunts) (loudly smacks) (loudly grunts) (loudly smacks) (dramatic music) (whipping and smacking) (loudly smacks) (softly thuds) (loudly whips) - Welcome to Sci-Fighter. (loudly grunting) (loudly crashes) (dramatic music) - [Dr. Tanaka] What's the matter? (game softly beeping) - Hey! - There's no way Brad's playing this thing. - Dad, I can take care of myself. - A game's just a game, but that really hurt. - You're overreacting, it's just adapting to your player skill level. - Just fix this thing or get rid of it. - Alright, alright, alright, I'll fix it, I'll fix it. (soft music) - See what I mean? He never listens. - Oh, I'm sorry about that, Brad. - He's such a hypocrite. He gets hit all the time and he says it's part of training. - Alright, I'll fix it and then I will, uh, I'll talk to your father and um... I'm sure I can talk him into letting you try the game again, okay, deal? - Deal. - Okay, deal, good. Alright, let's see what's wrong with this sucker here. - [Computer Voice] Sci-Fighter Diagnostic activated. (soft music) - Hey, your father loves you very much. He wants to do the best for you, and I know he's trying to understand you, and-- - He doesn't understand me. He never will. Not like Mom did. - Hey, (soft music) your mom would be very proud of you today. Yeah. (soft music) (softly exhales) (soft music) Well, I guess it's time to check this game out. (helmet lightly clattering) (game softly beeping) (upbeat techno music) (loudly swishes) (soft techno music) (lightly beeping) Everything appears to be normal. (upbeat techno music) (grunting and whipping) (lightly beeping) (grunting and whipping) Nothing seems to be wrong with this game. (grunting and whipping) Huh. (lightly beeping) (lightly beeping) (grunting and whipping) Programming. (ominous music) Interesting weather. (dramatic music) (soft piano music) (softly rattling) - [Brad] Come on, Mom, it looks horrible. - It looks good! Dad's gonna like it. - It looks horrible. He's gonna hate it. (chuckles) - Brad. (lightly laughing) (soft music) I love you. Okay, Dad's gonna be home. Let's get this done. Okay, we need the candles. Brad, you didn't forget the candles? - Yeah. I'm sorry. - Okay, he's gonna be home, we need to get to the store and be back quick, so come on. - Ma, I can't, I'm expecting a phone call. - Come on, we need to go to the store, it's late. - (groaning) Come on, please? - [Mom] Okay. Clean up and I'll be right back. (ominous music) (screams) - Mom! (softly exhaling) (crickets softly chirping) (game beeping and buzzing) (upbeat techno music) - Hey, Brad, where's Jack? - He's busy. - Oh, too bad. Same uniform? (buzzing and beeping) - Yeah. (loudly swishing and buzzing) (ominous music) (loudly swishes) (light techno music) (grunting and smacking) - Where's Daddy? - I can do this on my own. - You are not worthy. - Wanna bet? - Go home and practice, little boy. You are not worthy of fighting me. (dramatic music) (grunting and smacking) (loudly thuds) (loudly grunts) (loudly grunting) Are you sure you don't want to go get Daddy? (dramatic music) (grunting and whipping) Such a pity, I have to finish this futile display. (loudly smacking) (loudly grunting) (loudly thuds) (ominous music) (electricity hisses) (electricity hums) (game softly beeping) (ominous music) (game softly beeping) (ominous music) (power alert buzzing) - [Jack] Brad. (ominous music) Brad, take that thing off. (electricity hissing) (grunting) (ominous music) - [Computer Voice] System now operating on backup power supply. (ominous music) - What the hell's goin' on? (game buzzing and beeping) (ominous music) (keypad softly beeping) (ominous music) Dad, get over here fast, it's Brad. Just get over here! (ominous music) (game buzzing and beeping) (ominous music) (softly rustling) (door loudly clatters) - [Dr. Tanaka] Jack? - Dad! It's, it's Brad. - What's going on? - He was playing the game. I tried to take the helmet off and I got shocked. It's not even plugged in, what's happening? (ominous music) - I don't know, son. (game beeping and buzzing) (ominous music) His mind is trapped in the game. You have to go into the game, you have to find Brad and you must defeat all the fighters and get to the last level. (power alert softly beeps) That will give me the opportunity to transport you and Brad out of the game. But we don't have much time. - I'm going in. - Be careful, Jack. (ominous music) (loudly swishing and beeping) (light techno music) (ominous techno music) (water softly crashing) - Brad! (ominous music) (water softly crashing) Brad, where are you?

(loudly clinks) Dad, over here! (game buzzing and beeping) (ominous music) (keypad beeping) (ominous music) - Sally? Sally, Code Black. My worst nightmare, can you please get the recovery disk and come to Jack's house as soon as possible? Yes, please, thank you. (ominous music) (game buzzing and beeping) - [Brad's Voice] Dad, over here! Dad, I'm over here! (softly whipping) You're getting closer. (softly whipping) Here I am. (ominous music) Daddy. - What did you do with my son? - If you get through me, you just might find him. (dramatic music) (loudly whipping) Ah!

Why did you help me? (soft music) - You remind of someone. - Brad's not here. Go find him. (soft music) (buzzing and beeping) (ominous music) (ominous music) (loudly clattering) - Hey, whatcha doin'? - Hi, Dean, I have to bring this to Professor Tanaka. - Oh, yeah? You're not supposed to take anything out of here. - I know, this is an emergency. (ominous music) - Okay, go out the back door, I'll cover you. - Thanks.

(dramatic tribal drums) I'm sorry son, I only programmed two fighters for this level. (grunting) (loudly smacking) The game has learned all your moves. - How will I beat these guys? - You have to be innovative. (loudly smacks) Use your resources and usage. (dramatic tribal drums) (grunting and smacking) (dramatic tribal drums) Be focused. Your subconscious mind is the key. (dramatic techno music) (loudly smacking and grunting) (dramatic techno music) (smacking and grunting) (dramatic techno music) Well done, Jack. (game buzzing and beeping) Come on. Come on, Jack. - He's okay. (softly beeping and buzzing) Stay strong, Jack. Stay strong. (smacking and grunting) (dramatic techno music) (loudly smacks) (loudly grunts) - What's happening? - I'm afraid a virus has gotten into the game. It has corrupted and destroyed all the safety codes. Son, you are fighting for your life and Brad's. You've got to get to the next portal. (portal light humming) (softly swishes) (loudly swishing) (dramatic music) (loudly grunts) (loudly smacks) (loudly grunts) (loudly smacks) (grunting and smacking) (dramatic music) (lightly chuckling) - Surprise!

(ominous music) (shoes loudly echoing) - What have you done to my world? The program's been poisoned. - I swear, it wasn't me. - You lie! You and your father are the only new ones to the game. (ominous music) (loudly creaking) (ominous music) Run away, little boy. If you and your father return, I'll kill you both.

Grandpa, anybody, can you hear me? Who am I kidding? I'm stuck and it's all my fault. (ominous music) (portal light hums) Pretty clever, Grandpa. (portal light humming) (ominous music) - I'm goin' in. (softly buzzing and beeping) - That's odd, it's Dean. (softly buzzing and beeping) (grunting) (grunting and smacking) (muffled dramatic music) A residual image from the lab. (grunting and smacking) - Please don't kill me. I don't wanna die! You don't have to do this, my family's got money. We can pay you. (ominous music) Please don't kill me, please. (dramatic music) (grunting and smacking) (dramatic techno music) (loudly grunts) (softly thuds) (dramatic techno music) (grunting and smacking) (dramatic techno music) - Jack? - Dean? (shoes clattering) (dramatic music) (wind softly rustling) (shoes softly shuffling) - Hey! Hey, up here! - [Man] Where are you going? - I'm looking for my son. - Oh, Brad. You're going the wrong way. Go this way, go through the tunnel. (light tribal music) (whipping and grunting) (dramatic tribal drums) (grunting and smacking) (loudly smacks) (loudly thuds) Not bad for a beginner. Oh, by the way, I forgot one thing. You gotta go through me before you get to the next portal. - Hm, piece of cake.

You're looking for the portal to your son. - Where's Brad? (softly laughs) - Now, I can't tell you that. It wouldn't be as fun if I did. - [Jack] Where is he? - I hate kids, Jack, they're a waste of time. Brad's already interfering in our relationship. If it wasn't for him, we could be... Friends? - Sorry, you're not my type. (loudly smacks) (loudly grunts) (grunting and smacking) (Spaghetti Western guitar) (loudly smacks) (loudly grunts) - They call me The Scorpion. (Spaghetti Western acoustic guitar) Taste my venom, Jack. (loudly smacks) (loudly grunts) (Spaghetti Western acoustic guitar) - [Jack] Where's Brad? (The Scorpion grunts) (monitor softly beeping) (grunting and smacking) (Spaghetti Western guitar) - Ooh, I like it when you're rough! (loudly smacks) (grunts) You wouldn't hit a lady now, would you, Jack? (loudly smacks) (loudly grunts) You hit me! (loudly smacks) (loudly grunts) (loudly thuds) (loudly grunts) Oh! You win, Jack. Brad's not here. (light acoustic guitar) Come back and see me some time. I'd like to play a different game with you. (softly moans) (soft piano music) - What a beautiful picture of Brad and his mom. (soft piano music) - They were inseparable. (soft piano music) (light tropical music) (waves softly crashing) (seagulls cawing) (light tropical music) (giggling) - Relax. (light tropical music) No more fighting. (light tropical music) (ominous music) (loudly swishing) (ominous music) (light music) (shoes rustling) (wind chimes clinking) (light music) - Jack? Jack! (static buzzing) - [Jack] Dad! - Jack. - Is that you? - Yes. Jack, what are you doing, what's going on? - I have to catch her. - Who? - The White Dragon. - Jack, she's not real, I created her. You have to find Brad and get out of here as soon as possible. Time is running out. - I have to find her. (static hums) (ominous music) - Jack, time is running out. (ominous music) - Wake up, Jack. Wake up. (ominous music) (device softly beeping) (soft acoustic guitar) - Why did you return? (soft acoustic guitar) - I wanted to see you again. - You shouldn't have come back here. you have to keep moving forward in the game. Don't give up, defeat all the levels, and save your son. - But I don't wanna leave you, I-- - Listen, listen to me, Jack. I'm trying to help you. I can't let you stay here at this level. And my programming won't allow me to go with you. Find your son. Wake up. - [Sally's Voice] Wake up, Jack. Wake up, Jack, wake up. (electricity hisses) (ominous music) (softly giggling) - Hey, you're messin' around with my girlfriends, come here. Let's do it. (girlfriends lightly laugh) (waves softly crashing) (light upbeat techno music) (dramatic techno music) (smacks) (dramatic techno music) (softly whipping) (loudly smacks) (dramatic techno music) (loudly grunting) (dramatic techno music) (grunting and smacking) (dramatic techno music) (grunting) (bones cracking) (ominous techno music) (loudly groans) (dramatic techno music) (grunts and smacks) (dramatic techno music) (loudly smacks) (loudly grunts) (grunting and smacking) (dramatic techno music) (bone cracking) (grunting) (loudly smacks) (loudly grunts) (loudly smacks) (dramatic techno music) (loudly smacks) (loudly grunts) (loudly smacks) (loudly thuds) (ominous music) (portal light chimes) (grunting and smacking) (dramatic tribal drums) - Dad, how did you fi-- What's wrong? - You're what's wrong. You deliberately disobeyed me. And this is what happens. - I'm sorry, I didn't mean for this to happen. - Don't apologize. You've always been a loser. And it's your fault your mother's dead. (ominous music) - I'm sorry. - Now that she's gone, I don't have to put up with you anymore. - Dad, don't leave, please! - Don't touch me! You disgust me. Get outta my sight. (ominous music) - Shut up. (ominous music) - What did you say? - I said shut up. - That's no way to talk to your, Daddy. - You're not my father. My father loves me, and so did my mother. Go to hell. (loudly grunts) (hologram hums) - Brad! (grunting and smacking) What are you doing? - Get off of me. - Brad, what are you doing, it's me! (soft music) - Dad? - Are you alright? - Yeah, I am now. (soft music) - I love you, son. - I think they found each other. (softly beeps) - We've got to get to the last level so we can get out of here. - What are we supposed to do? (ominous music) (softly clicking) (hologram hums) (computers buzzing and beeping) (phone rings) - Andrew Dean. - Dr. Tanaka here, look, I need your help. You've played the game more than anyone else. Can you tell me if there's a pattern in the path to the last level? - Well, you know the path to the last portal is randomized. But I've seen a pattern that depends on the skill level of the player. If he's any good, it'll be the middle path. Is there a problem, Doc? - I hope not, I hope not, Dean. Thank you very much, bye. (portal swishes) (ominous music) - We're back on Level 1. - What's going on? (hologram softly swishes) Grandpa! (hologram softly swishes) - Brad! Jack! - What's goin' on? - The game ends where it begins. And now, you must find the correct path to get to the last level. (ominous music) - Which one? - I'm not sure, son. The virus has corrupted the game and I believe that you should take the middle path. - I don't know, Dad, I think it's this one. (ominous music) - Gotta go with my gut on this one, Dad. Let's try your way, Brad. (ominous music) (hologram swishes) (loudly swishing) (swords whipping) (dramatic tribal music) - Hit the wrong portal! We're never gonna get outta here alive. - Don't give up on me, Brad. We're gonna get outta here and we're gonna do it together. (swords whipping) (dramatic tribal music) (grunts) (swords whipping) - Just like Mom, it's all my fault she died. - It was not your fault. A man with a knife killed your mom, not you. (grunting) (swords whipping) We have to live up to what she wanted for us. Which means we have to get out of here. (swords whipping and clinking) - How are we gonna get out? (ominous music) (swords whipping) - I think I got an idea. (swords whipping) (screams) (swords whipping) (dramatic tribal music) Come on, Brad! - I can't do it! - They're not real, come on! They won't hurt you. - I can't! - You can do it, Brad, they're not real. Don't be afraid! (swords whipping) (dramatic tribal music) - I can't do it! - They won't hurt you, trust me. (swords whipping) We're running out of time, we've gotta go now. Do it, Brad, do it! (swords whipping) (dramatic tribal music) (hologram softly humming) - How'd you know they weren't real? - I didn't. But remember what Grandpa said? Things here aren't always what they seem to be? Sometimes in life, son, the biggest obstacles are just in your mind. Let's go. (portal light hums) (softly swishing) (portal chimes) - I guess Grandpa was right. (ominous techno music) - Yeah, I guess sometimes, the old guy knows what he's talking about. One more fight and we're outta here. Everything's gonna be alright. (ominous techno music) I'll take the guys on the left. (dramatic orchestral music) (grunting and smacking) (lightly thuds) That portal's gotta be here someplace, son. - Dad, wait, I think it's over here. (portal light humming) (muffled cheers and applause) - Wait here. - I'm going with you. - I've got to do this alone. - I'm not letting you go by yourself. We're family. (muffled cheers and applause) - That's why you gotta trust me, son. (muffled cheers and applause) (ominous music) (hard rock music) (crowd roaring) (hard rock music) * You gotta trust in me * I gotta trust in you * It's never too late * You know that trust is the glue * Just trust in me * And I'll trust in you * We'll keep it together * 'Cause trust, trust is the glue (hard rock music) (cheers and applause) (electricity humming) (dramatic music) (game buzzing and beeping) - What's, what's happening? (dramatic music) (game buzzing and beeping) (dramatic techno music) - Dad! (smacks) (loudly grunts) (grunting and smacking) (dramatic techno music) - Where do you think you're goin? - Dad! (grunting) (softly whipping) (loudly smacks) (loudly smacks) (loudly smacks) (loudly grunts) (grunting and smacking) - You destroy my world, now I'm gonna destroy yours. (dramatic techno music) (grunting and smacking) (muffled grunting and smacking) - Jack? (dramatic techno music) (grunting and smacking) (loudly smacks) (loudly grunts) (loudly smacks) (loudly grunts) (loudly smacks) (loudly grunts) (loudly smacks) (loudly grunts) (dramatic techno music) (grunting and smacking) (loudly smacks) (loudly grunts) (dramatic techno music) (grunting and smacking) (loudly thuds) (dramatic techno music) (grunting and smacking) (loudly grunting) (dramatic techno music) (dramatic techno music) (grunting and smacking) (loudly smacks) (loudly grunts) (loudly smacks) (loudly grunts) - Come on, Jack, I thought you had more than that. (loudly smacks) (loudly grunts) (dramatic techno music) (grunting and smacking) (metal clattering) (dramatic techno music) (dramatic techno music) (grunting and smacking) (loudly smacks) (grunting) (ominous music) - Hey!

(grunting and smacking) (dramatic techno music) (dramatic techno music) (grunting) (bone softly cracking) (loudly thuds) - [Brad] Dad! (soft piano music) - Brad, I told you to wait for me. - You gotta trust me too, Dad. - Consider yourself ungrounded. - Let's go home, Dad. (soft piano music) (portal light hums) - The portal is opening! (game buzzing and beeping) (gasps) Brad, Brad, I'm so happy you made it! - What about Jack? - Jack? - Dad? (ominous music) (loudly whipping) - Hyah! (loudly whipping) You're not finished yet! (loudly swishing) (ominous music) (game buzzing and beeping) - Jack is left behind! (loudly swishing) (hologram buzzing) - Your time is up, Jack, your life is mine. (dramatic techno music) (grunting and smacking) - Transport him back, Professor. - I'm trying, I'm trying! I can't stop it. - I'm going back in after him. - No, no, Brad, you can't, please, don't! - Dad, don't give up! I need you. (grunting and smacking) (dramatic techno music) (loudly whips) (loudly smacks) (loudly chiming) (loudly smacks) (softly grunts) (loudly smacking) (softly grunting) (loudly whipping) (light beam humming) (ominous music) - I am the virus, I needed a worthy opponent so I used your love for the boy to bring you here. I will destroy this world, and then yours. (softly grunting) (light beam humming) (electric shock buzzing) (dramatic orchestral music) (grunting and whipping) (electric shock buzzing) (dramatic orchestral music) (loudly thuds) What's the matter, Jack, you lose your nerve? (softly chuckles) (softly beeping) - [Computer Voice] Backup power supply shutting down. (softly buzzes and beeps) (ominous music) - We're out of time. - Dad, I need you! I don't wanna lose you too. I love you. (ominous music) (Brad's voice echoing) Dad, Dad? (softly sobbing) - I don't need this to finish you. (dramatic orchestral music) (electricity buzzing) (dramatic techno music) (grunting and smacking) (electric shock hisses) (dramatic techno music) (grunting and smacking) (loudly grunts) (loudly rumbles) (softly whipping) (dramatic techno music) (loudly rumbles) (softly grunts) (electric shock buzzing) (dramatic techno music) (electric shocks rumbling) (dramatic techno music) (loudly rumbles and buzzes) (dramatic techno music) (loudly rumbles and buzzes) (loudly whips) (loudly rumbles and buzzes) (loudly thuds) (hologram softly hums) (ominous music) (electricity chiming) - Dad! Dad! (ominous music) (shoes softly clattering) (softly groaning) (soft orchestral music) - I thought you were the virus, I was wrong. (portal light hums) - Jack, oh, I'm so glad you're safe. - How did you get here? (soft piano music) - I've learned to overcome my programming. - What's wrong? (soft music) - You must use my energy to activate the portal to your world. - What do you mean? (portal light humming) (game buzzing and beeping) - He's gone. (sobbing) (soft music) - Professor, professor! - He's alive, Brad take the visor off! - Brad. - Dad. - (softly sobs) I'm so happy! Thank God. Jack, this is Sally. (light orchestral music) - Hi. (light orchestral music) (light upbeat music) - Block, punch. Block, punch, block punch. Oh, excuse me, guys, come on, guys, oh! Whose is this, whose is this? Excuse me. (light upbeat music) (softly whipping) (softly claps) Alright, class, this way. Sometimes, life's greatest obstacles are just in our minds. I put a two by four on the ground here, stretched across the class, and I ask you who wants to run across that? How many of you would do it, how many would do it? Raise your hands. Okay, very good, very good. But if I take the same two by four-- - Hey. - And put it on top of two 100-story skyscrapers, and now I say, "Who's wants to run across it?" How many of you would get on there and run across that board? Not even you. Well the reason is, when you concentrate on the negative result of making a mistake, falling and hitting the ground, you can't put one foot in front of the other. It becomes almost impossible, the easiest thing in the world, walking. So that lesson that you learn from this is this: life's greatest obstacles, many times, are just in our minds. And if you concentrate and put one foot in front of the other, soon, you can overcome any obstacle. One foot in front of the other, don't even think about falling. Just think about the positive result of getting to the other side, everybody understand? Okay, back to training. Back to the workout. (softly whipping) - [Student] Hiyah!
