Here's what no one ever tells you about your 20s. You'll still have no clue who you really are and you will be the last one to know it. When I was a kid, I thought I'd have it all figured out. By the ancient age of 28, I'd have a glamorous husband, a successful career, possibly a castle. Instead, I had a roommate, a subway pass, and a credit card balance the size of a third world GMP. But I was happy. I had great friends, New York, fun guys like Calvin to spend time with. What more did I need? Actually, I was about to find out, I just didn't know it yet. This one's for Frannie. Oh wait. What is that? Oh, hmm. Okay it's not so much that there's pizza in your bed, it's that it's the second time this week. What do we have here? Ooh, anchovies and pineapple, very bold. So, so I get late night take out cravings. I never said that I was domestic. Oh, I have a confession to make too. Do you? I'm not after your cooking. You can't stay tonight, you know? I can't be late tomorrow again. - Okay - I can't Calvin. ♪ I, do want him; ♪ ♪ Something to begin ♪ ♪ And trick him into knowing what to think ♪ ♪ While walking around waiting downtown ♪ Oh my God, you're Michael... Shh, don't speak. I just read your last theatre review and had to meet you. I've been waiting for an editor like you for my whole life, Pulitzer be damned. Francis! I didn't see you. How embarrassing. You want to put some ice on that. Why was Michael Tate here? Because I, the genius that I am, talked him into doing a series of essays for us. Take that Vanity Fair. I want the assignment. But you're a very fine entertainment editor, right? I mean movie stars and those little book prices, I mean that's your niche. Glory in it, carpe librum. But I edited the Indachi Feature when Joan had her goiter surgery, you said that you liked my work. Veniva has seniority, ergo the job. What job? Marina, what job? I totally respect that, I do. On the other hand if I could just say in my defense, quiz me, okay? I have read everything that he's ever written. His work is, God it's an explosion of pure verbal lyricism and why couldn't I have said that to him five minute ago? But my point is is that I know how he thinks and I know what he needs. And not giving me a shot at this is a mistake. Please give me a chance. There's something vaguely Darwinian about this that peaks my interest so here's what I'm gonna' do. I'm gonna' set up a little meeting and the rest is up to you. Oh, thank you! A little less, a little less hugging. Oh, sorry. Okay! Yes! What was I thinking? I mean the guy won a Pulitzer and I think I'm good enough to edit him. Where'd I get the hubris? For one thing, you know what the hell a hubris is. Hey, d'you wanna' borrow my shoes? Mm-mm, too sexy. I need something that says that I'm wise and capable and do not usually walk into doors. Well that one just says Hooters. This new pill I'm on is totally screwing with my hormones. I feel like I'm smuggling Zeppelins under here. Remind me to feel sorry for you when I get boobs. I'm so excited that I'm nauseous. So... How do I look? Like a feature's editor. But I think at the end of the day, you've got a book, ya know? Here comes Cinderella now. Punctual as ever. Michael, may I present Francis Mackenzie. - Hello. - Hi. I'm so sorry I'm late. Oh no, not at all. My father has a saying that a woman is never late if she's worth waiting for. Oh that's nice. How's the head? Better. - Good. - Thank you. So, tell us about your process. Well it's very complex. Usually I stare at the page 'til the terror recedes enough to write. So um, what sort of themes were you thinking of exploring? An examination of the state aloud attraction, fidelity, commitment. Oh, that's interesting. I'm sure Frannie here would feel guilty editing you, there'd be so little work to do, right Frannie? Well, not really. I mean, there's a few things that... Really. Oh, go on. You may be over fond of aphorism and too afraid of imagery at times and your arguments do tend to lose focus and stray into repetition, maybe a little tiny bit. Maybe. I think what she meant to say... No, I confess I usually don't get criticism from perspective editors. I can imagine. Which is kind of why you need to though. I think when you're as good as you are, people tend to stop asking for better. Now I have more faith in your talent than that and I think that you do too. Interesting. Look, I may have been a bit harsh in the end. Okay, here's the thing. If I'm gonna' trust your instincts, I have to know who I'm dealing with, right? We're gonna' have to get completely naked, figuratively speaking. Where did you go to school? Columbia. Where are you from? New York, just outside of New York. You know what, actually nowhere near New York. A tiny town just north of Toronto. What's your favorite novel? Ulysses. Impressive. Now, tell me the real one. Gone with the Wind? No, no, why would you possibly admit that out loud? You said to get completely naked, so. At least have socks on, woman. Clearly you need me as much as I need you. So, hopefully some of my good taste will rub off on ya'. All right, let's get to it. Yeah, okay, okay. 12 months. 12 examinations of the way love shapes us, makes us, breaks us. This is the quest I begin, the journey I hope to take you on, and in the end I hope to uncover these many little truths for all of us solitary voyagers. So what do you think? He sounds really arrogant. Arrogant. How can you say that? Okay, okay what do you think? It's kind of boring. You don't have to do that, you know? The stove always shorts. I leave in a week, I would feel much more comfortable if I knew you weren't going to starve while I'm gone. But I don't cook. I mean, what is he even trying to say in that article, in english? It's about defining the nature of love. Are you saying that you could do better? No, no, I'm saying I'd be too start to try. Okay, how about this one? Um, kind of desperate. Okay here, describe green to me. You know I can't describe green to you. Exactly, and that's just a color so what makes writer boy think that he can explain love? Okay. Kind of tardy? Yes, we have a winner. Don't wait up for me. Okay bye, have fun! Thanks I will! Ooh. Calvin. My work here is done. - Mm-hmm. - Yeah. Oh, this is classic, now you're shooting down my entire thesis. Look, I'm not saying that opposites don't attract okay, they do, I'm just saying that they don't last. It's mostly a physical. Oh, meaning what? Real love is strictly mental? Have you ever been in love? Sure. Real love like Tristan and Isolde love. Oh, love! Yeah. No, not yet. You? Oh yeah, all the time. Highly recommend it. Look, I'm just saying that the real stuff I think is based on a kind of common commonality, you know? A meeting of like minds kind of thing. Well now, you and I are like minded, so you're saying that you're attracted to me? You have to say I'm, you know, pressed for curiosity for the article. You can't ask me that. Sure I can, I just did. You're stalling. I am not. You're stalling. I am not stalling, I'm just saying that I never thought about it. Maybe, yeah. But um, maybe you should. Hey, I have a showing. A friend has a showing tomorrow night at the Regency. You should come with, huh? We can keep talking about this, together. Okay. All right, bye. Hey. Oh. Oh, oh. Sorry I'm late. It's amazing how many pairs of underwear you need for a three month tour. It's like six, seven. That was a joke Fran, you okay? Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm just so out of it. Probably just sensitive because I'm leaving. It's understandable, I'm quite a loss. I'm going to miss you, three months? God, you know, that's kind of longer than we've been seeing each other. Right. Probably be swarmed by foreign chicks who just love jazz. Sure. But they won't be you. Calvin. Look we never really talked about what the understanding was gonna' be while you're gone. Personally, I was hoping you would stay at home and pine. Pine? And knit me things. Yeah. Look, I'm not an idiot Fran, we're early days here. I don't own you but I want you to know I'm gonna' come looking for you the moment I get back. Um, Francis Mackenzie. Nope, no Mackenzie. Who are you here with? Um, Michael Tate, t, a... She's with me. Hi. You look lovely. Thank you, thank you. You know um, I practically lived at the MOMA when I moved to New York. I think after words, art is definitely my next love. Yeah, I got lucky. I sort of grew up around writers and painters my whole life. Yeah. What, what is under that smile? Oh, it's just um, you know I've kind of fantasized about this sort of night since I moved to New York. It's not that I fantasized about you per se, not in a good way or a bad way. Sometimes I just, I have to stop. I like it. I think your thoughts are the one thing you don't add up. Come on, I want to introduce you to some people. Okay. This is Dr. Tim Cano. Word of advice, if you ever start feeling like life is finally exactly where you wanted it to be, duck. Because fates about to throw you a curve. I'm sorry, I don't know what's wrong with me. I'll just take one. Thank you very much. No, I'm good. Look, I'm freaking out. I can't even look, just tell me when it changes. Did you pee on this? Yes Marina, I peed on it okay. That's the way that it works. Just please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please please, please not now! Not now! Okay, just be cool because there's no way that you're pregnant. No way. I swear to God if Calvin got me pregnant, I will, I will, I will break every finger on his guitar hand. I will break him. I can't get fat, I don't have the cheekbones. Please God, please. I will give up sex and chocolate. And sex involving chocolate. Frannie, I think it's done. What does two lines mean? You're definitely pregnant. Sorry, go ahead. I'd say you were 10 weeks. 10 weeks, wow. Can I see it? Not yet, but would you like to hear the heartbeat? Already? Oh you'd be surprised how quickly it all happens. I know what a shock it can be for my new patients. You go about your life and walk around thinking nothing's changed. Meanwhile, there's this. That's it's heart? Mm-hmm. Sounds scared. I guess we already have something in common. You do have options, Frannie.

Welcome to Canada. Business or pleasure? Neither actually, I'm here visiting my parents. Good luck with that. Thank you. I love my family, but the closer you are to your parents, the more space you need from them at a certain point in your life. A lot of space, like an international border between you kind of space. They're kind of crazy and they're completely smothering, but they're mine. And I still need their approval. I'm an adult, I'm an adult, I'm an adult. Hi! Hun, she's here! Happy anniversary! I can't believe you made it. What a lovely surprise. Where's your luggage? Oh, I'm actually heading back tomorrow. I have to work in the morning. Oh, interesting. There's my Frannie, oh it warms my heart to see you pet, what a treat. Hi dad! Let's move to the kitchen, I'm doin' the... I've been reading some of your recent articles. Really? That is wonderful stuff. - Thank you dad. - Wonderful. Dear uh, put the kettle on and I'll join you girls in a minute. So can I hep you with the party prep? What are you not telling me? What? Mom, save the head shrinking for your patients. Okay, nothing's wrong. I'm just here because I love you and I missed you. And I'm a tiny bit pregnant. John! Frannie and I are going out! Oh, feel free to offer congratulations. You've got to give me a little bit of time to process this. The last time we talked there wasn't anyone special and now there is a baby? I assume this wasn't planned. Not so much. Well, that's fine. I mean you're a healthy young woman. You have sexual needs... Mom. Dear, I have many clients your age and the amount of casual sex you all are having is, well astounding. Mom, I'm not one of your patients. Okay, I'm not crazy, I'm just pregnant. Please don't call them crazy. Tell me about the boy. He's a musician. Tell me something I'd like about the boy. Well his name is Calvin Putty. He comes from a long line of meat packers, I think. Uh huh, and you have told him, this singing meat packer. That's kind of a funny story really because you'll like this one, he left the country before I could tell him. Uh huh, so you will raise the child in New York, alone. It's not like it's never been done before. I'll be fine, I've thought of everything. Francis, hear me out. I'm your mother, I love you, but I also know you and sweetheart, you just aren't the kind of woman who can do this on her own. I am doing this, okay? And mom, I would really like your support because I'm actually kind of terrified right now. Frannie. Miss me yet? Calvin? Sorry, you're gonna' have to speak up, it's a lousy connection. Uh, where are you? In a goldmine. Can't find it on a map, but they love us here. You should come next time. So, what's new with you. Oh, you know, nothing new. I am in Toronto, I'm behind deadline. I'm pregnant. Vagrant? Pregnant? Gotta be louder Fran, I can't hear. Oh for God sakes, Calvin you knocked me up, I'm having your baby! Did you hear me? Are you there? Lousy connection. So. So, I think he hung up on me. The important thing is that you told him. This is really good. So let's go home and what you need right now is be surrounded by your family. Our family? Yeah. Penis! Vagina! Penis! Vagina! Penis! Vagina, vagina, vagina! Vagina, vagina. Mom, you should've seen Robyn today. She did the best rolls in Kinder Gym. So dad, Sandy and I loved our Christmas cruise so much, we're sending you and mom for you gift. Oh no, you really shouldn't. That's too much. No, no it's not the expense. It's the thought that counts. I wish people would say what they mean. So, I'm pretty much going to go on and on bragging about myself tonight, mostly to distract everyone from that very small penis Frannie saw in the kiddie pool that one summer. But also, to compensate for my tense marriage and overly medicated pill popping wife here. It's true, he will. Oh and Fran, I'm gonna' talk insistently to mom about parenting to make you feel left out and to distract myself from the gaping suck hole of a wound where my life used to be. Oh and I hate you for still having a waist. Aunt Frannie, you're day dreaming again. Snap out of it. Happy anniversary! Happy anniversary. - John. - Madeline. What's up New York? Too good for champagne now? No. Come on, since when don't you drink? Richard, she doesn't have to drink if she doesn't want to. What is she pregnant or something? Surprise! Well, congrats. Richard. No, no. I mean that's great. Just because we've been trying years and have five dogs and a freakin' ferret turning our house into a dog damned kennel just to fill the void, when I'm sure all Frannie had to do was one too many shots of liquor and a sailor. Woo hoo! That's no reason to be bitter. In fact, a toast to my little sister. My knocked up little sister. Pass the Yorkshire pudding, please. Can someone pass the gravy? Gravy's comin' at ya'. Dad. You've always done things your own way, Frannie. Not always things I choose for you. But, it always worked out in the end. Congratulations pet. Thanks dad. Let's uh, eat hmm? Next. Calvin, you ass. Excuse me? Oh no, not you. I barely know, don't be silly. Uh huh. Residency. Manhattan. You live in New York but your citizenship is Canadian? May I see your visa please, ma'am? It just expired recently. I mean expired is such a strong word, right? I much prefer lapsed. This says it expired two years ago. So, isn't this interesting. Living illegally on American soil? Did you really think you could get away with it Ms. Mackenzie, if that is your real name? What do you have to say for yourself? I'm sorry. I'm really, really sorry. I'll be sure to pass that along to the taxpayers. You can forget about this flight. You're not going to be crossing our borders anytime soon. But that's ridiculous, I have a job to get to. Look, I'm not even from Canada anymore, I'm a New Yorker. Ma'am, you do not raise your voice to me. I am a government officer. Oh please, you are a hairnet away from a fast food cashier. Look that is my hormones talking, that's not me. Okay, I'm sorry, look. Girl to girl, woman to woman, I can't handle this stress right now because I'm actually with child. Oh. Well, in that case. Under article five sub seven, you are hereby barred from entering the United States for no less than one year. You can't do this, I... Have a good day. I'd offer you fries with that, but we're fresh out. Next! That little polyester wearing desk pot! She probably got fired from Smart Mart, now she's all like "Woo-hoo, look at me, "I'm a border guard, I can make your life a living hell!" Frannie, this is silly. You have lived in New York for nearly 10 years. You surely have a visa. There is a small possibility that I may have forgotten to renew it recently. Francis! What, I'm sure that there's a loophole, okay? I'm sure that I can contest it and reapply. In the present immigration climate? How far along are you? 11 weeks. Why? I hate to be the one to break this to you, dear but... Don't even say it mom. You are not going back to New York until you have had this baby. So now I'm pregnant and homeless. What do you expect me to do, you want me to send for my stuff and wait it out here in the tundra? Do you have an alternative suggestion? No. Not even a little bit. Just stay with us, pet. Oh. Come on. Come on! Come on, just please, please, please, please, please work! Pronto. Hello Mr. Halsford? Hi, this is Frannie Mackenzie. Look I'm, I missed my flight. My visa was denied. Is this your somewhat peculiar way of asking for a raise? What, oh no, not that kind of visa. Look I, I'm stuck in Toronto, but don't panic. Nobody needs to panic, it's a global village, right? I mean I can totally, totally keep working with Michael from here. And how long do you intend to remain one of the global village people? Oh not long, just a few months. Possibly 12. Just long enough to have a baby. I see. The next sound you hear will be me hanging up. It's not fair, you know? I mean I graduated from Columbia, twice! I just worked so hard to get out of this stupid little town and now I'm back and I'm trapped and I'm about to get really, really fat. Listen, Halsford seems fine with you handing Tate's stuff up there if he is. That's a conversation that I'm dying to have. I adore you, please take me away and love me forever. By the way, I'm having another man's baby. Have you um, have you heard from Calvin. Does silence count? I could put a hit on him, you know? I know people. All right, I've slept with people who say they know people. Oh my god Marina, that's Michael. I have to go, okay? Wish me luck. Hello? So, just heard the big news form Halsford. Congratulations. So what do you think? I think there are easier ways to get out of a second date with me. Yeah it's just, you sure you can do this? Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I know that it's gonna' be hard but uh, I think that I'll probably be a good mom, you know? I meant the articles. Right, right of course you did. It's just I've never worked long distance before Frannie, and it's not organic, to be frank it makes me nervous. Look Michael, I know that this situation is not ideal okay, but I take my work very seriously and I swear to you that we can do this. Just please, please, please trust me. I do. Of course I do, um, I'll have the next in before morning. Okay, thank you. Bye. Please, please, please, please, please give me my visa back. Sorry I'm late. Oh my god, you're here. I hate you, I hate you. I'm so glad you're here. Are you gonna' let go? No. Okay. How long are you staying As long as you'll let me What about your band? Well, I think our first kid is a little more important. Easy buddy, I'm freaked out enough being pregnant and I'm not sure what kind of commitment I'm ready for. I'm not asking for any. Francis tells us you're a musician. He's very talented. Anything that we might've heard? I don't think so. It's jazz mostly. Oh, well we like jazz that Diana Krall girl. Oh, she's lovely. Actually it's experimental. We use found instruments. Found instruments. What's that mean? Like you know... Sometimes I'll play a balloon. Or an electrified rake. I see. Good money in that, is there? Is there a bathroom? Down the hall to the right. Well, there goes the gene pool. I think I have angina. So you guys really hate him, huh? - No, no actually. - No. I am undecided. Apart from the fact that he is a borderline musician with an affection for gardening tools, he is the father of your child and he is here to help you. And you have no idea how valuable those things are to you right now, but we do. So, he can stay? He can stay. ♪ Trippin' on cinnamon and peppermint seas ♪ ♪ Singin' oh ♪ ♪ Where a mermaid and me are happily sex'in ♪ ♪ Oh ♪ ♪ Then the thunder wakens ♪ ♪ Then I'm back in a flash the spirits and I ♪ ♪ The wind-demons have bitten the sky ♪ ♪ Singin' oh ♪ ♪ When a paper-bag princess catches my eye ♪ ♪ Oh ♪ ♪ The windows open ajar the rain seeps in ♪ ♪ I'm back in a splash the spirits and I ♪ ♪ Oh ♪ ♪ Oh ♪ ♪ The soldier and his knapsack take a rest ♪ ♪ Thinking oh ♪ ♪ Living on a stone and the things gone past ♪ ♪ Oh ♪ ♪ Then the canons waken ♪ ♪ He's back in a crash the spirits and him ♪ Frannie?

I'm the one who has to do it. I know. I am so sorry. Hey, as long as we both can't sleep, do you want a Christmas gift early? Yes. Is it a washer and dryer. Yes, I got you a washer and dryer. I know you've been missing New York so I figured if we can't go to Manhattan, why not bring Manhattan to us? Oh my god. Oh my god! Calvin, this is amazing. How did you do this? This is the Brooklyn Bridge! It's where we ended our first date. Yup, and it was raining and you wouldn't kiss me because you said it would be a cliche. - Mm. - Mm-hmm. Come here. There's Temple Bar. Oh yeah. Where you kept kissing me until I agreed to take you home. I seem to remember it the other way around. Mm-hmm. Whatever. You know, I realized the other day in all our amazing firsts we missed a pretty important one. Our first dance. I feel like a cow. But you move like a gazelle. Oh, you're a liar. Thanks for staying. You have no idea how much I appreciate that you're here. Where else would I want to be? Maybe you're peeing on me? I think my water just broke. Oh shoot! Shoot, okay. Don't panic, I'm totally on it. Okay, okay. I totally got you, come on. We are having a baby! We're having a baby. I know you're tired, but I need one more. Uh! Come on Frannie, one big push Push it yourself! Calvin, I can't do this anymore, I can't. I'm sorry, I know but we'll just come back in a few weeks, okay please? Okay, shh, you are doing so amazing right now we are so close. Come on, come on. Push Frannie! Come on, I can see the head. No, I can't do this! I'm sorry, I quit! Okay, hey, hey, hey. I know how much you two want to meet each other, hmm? You are so close, we just need one more push, okay? One more, one more. Okay. Good Frannie. Good! Keep it coming, that's it! And here's the baby. Does the father want to cut the cord? Yes. Uh, there is it? Okay. It's a boy. We have a son? Hi Kim. What's a Kim? That's his name. No, it's not. Yes it is. It's after my music mentor. Was I sleeping when you became the boss of me? Oh, so he gets your last name and a first name you pick for him. Pardon me if I'd like to have some say in this, by giving my first born a name that actually means something to me. Pick another one. Killus. No. Bjorn. No. Ishmail. Definitely not. - Lester? - Ishmail. Lester. He kind of looks like a Lester. I know. Hi Lester. It's nice to meet you. Hi Lester. Come on! It's cold! Welcome home, pet. Oh he's lovely. Hi dad. I'm so proud of you. Thank you. Baby boy! I can see like all dads you're a pack animal now. Yes, oh no, no, no. Hugs for fathers, come on in. Lester. You know I really think we're going to have to cancel your brother's cruise, you're not ready. Mom, please go! Richard will kill me if I ruin his gift with my fecundity. She's right dear, let's let the kids breathe. All right, but I can not overstress to you the importance of these first few weeks of development. Calvin, this is for you too. Now, I've got you a selection of classical music to increase his spatial abilities, and whale calls for verbal. You play the classical when he's feeding and the other when he's asleep. You look lost, you're lost. Call the travel agent. - No. - Cancel the trip. Mom, no, no we just need. We need space to self actualize as new parents. I completely respect that. Can grandpa hold the Lester? Watch his head. Calvin, why don't you put on some Mozart, hmm? God, he's just so cute. I think he has your nose. I think he has your eyes. You know, I'm so far behind on deadline I really should go do some work. I'll watch the spud today. The sooner you're done, the sooner you get to come play with us. Oh you are so getting lucky tonight. Okay, not tonight but I'll pencil you in for next month. Oh, you could be a singer, huh? Check out those lungs. Yeah, he'll stop in a minute. Okay, he's not hungry, he's not wet, there's no fever, it's got to be colic. Don't say colic, okay just please don't say colic. It says here that colic can last three months. You're not helping me Putty! Check his bum again. I'm trying. Don't wrap him so tight, okay it's not freakin' origami. Oh wait, wait, wait, we're supposed to look at the poo. What are we looking for? I don't know, Calvin, I don't know. Calvin! I don't know, I don't know what to do. I just, I am all out of ideas baby. Why does he hate us? He does, he hates us. Hello! Hi. How is she? Um, see for yourself. She's been pumping for like six hours. Can you talk to her, I'll get Lester. - Hi. - Hi. Hi Frannie. Hi. Mom, hi. Frannie, what are you doing? I'm just storing some milk because um, I really need a drink, mom. Like a big one or some Dramamine maybe, horse tranquilizers, crack pipe, I don't care just please knock me out! Why don't you come with me? Okay. We're gonna' go for a little walk, give me those. Okay. Get some fresh air. Oh, will there be beer there? Go find your coat. Okay. Hi dad. Hi pet. We'll be back. Where did I go? I mean I lost my apartment, my city, my friends, my waist! All I've got is what's left of my job and Calvin. And Lester. You are having a temporary identity crisis. It's normal. It gets better, I promise. Can I tell you something. Sure. I'm not so sure that I'm gonna' be any good at this. I wish I could off you some panacea, but the truth is being a mother is the hardest job there is. And you know it never really stops being hard, but it never really stops being wonderful. And that is the deal. For the record, I still feel this close to going completely insane. Well, for the record I've been feeling that way for almost 40 years.

Well, I know a little something that might cheer you up. Someone is havin' a birthday. And it's... My birthday, oh that's great. That's just, that's great. So now I'm not just a loser, I'm a 29 year old loser. I don't need a reminder about how old I'm getting, Cal. Surprise! Happy birth... My parents? Okay, you know what? Let's put this in perspective. You lost a job, not a limb. This isn't about the job. Okay, get up. We need to go for a walk. I don't feel like going outside. Frannie, now. Okay, I am trying Frannie. I'm trying really hard to understand what you're going through. Look, what do you want me to say? You want me to say that I'm happy with my life, that I'm exactly where I wanted to be? Nobody is exactly where they wanted to be. Hell, I gave up my band. Oh my god, you had to stop playing the balloon? I'm sorry, I didn't mean that. I just... I'm not myself right now and I think that that's pretty much the problem. So what are you tryin' to say? You regret having Lester? God no, don't twist this. I love him. But that is not some magic pill that means that this new life makes sense to me. It doesn't mean that we make sense to me. I just, I just don't want to wake up one day and realize that the only reason we're together is because we had a kid. That's not gonna' happen. How do you know? Because I'm in love with you, Frannie. I love that you are smart about words and clueless about life. That you're always in a hurry and never on time. I even love the stuff that I hate about you. So the real question is, are you in love with me? How am I supposed to know who I love when I don't even know who I am? How am I supposed to answer that question? I think you just did. Calvin.

Lord have I got news. Marina? Why are you whispering? How would you like your job back? Why? Veniva's being fired as we speak. I know, it's fantastic. Turns out Tate couldn't stand her, he claims she threw him off his track. So what does this have to do with me? He wants to fly up there to talk about rehiring you. What, when will he be coming? Uh, I don't know. I think he said tomorrow? Tomorrow? Tomorrow. Hi. Hi! I'll have a peameal on a kaiser and a decaf grande non-fat cappuccino. I'm just kidding, I'll have a coffee. Oh, okay. Two please, thank you. - Wow. - Yeah. Final booth at the Western Sandwich, not quite the Rainbow Room. Oh god, please don't talk about New York. I miss it. You look great. Haven't changed. You expected hair rollers and a bathrobe? No, no, no but you're life's different now. You're a single mom, and I needed to come here in person to make sure you're ready to work again. I am so ready to come back to work. Look I know that I dropped the ball before, but I really feel like I'm getting my life back on track. I'm firing on all cylinders and you just hear everybody saying that you permanently change, that you're gonna' be different forever, but I feel the same as I did before. I don't see it. There is absolutely no difference, I'm completely lactating right now, aren't I? I am, okay. Milk? We're covered, thanks. God, that was embarrassing. Leave it to me to have ironic breast milk. It was excellently done. I really like working with you. But I am up against the wall on these deadlines, so you have to be honest with me. How are you Frannie, really? Honestly, well this is the first business conversation that I've had in eight months, I get less sleep than a surgical intern, I have baby vomit on my shoe, and the last book I've read involved dishes running with spoons. Ah. But Michael, I still know when your sentences are weak. I still know when your arguments run on. I'm a good editor, and I'm ready to come back. So. Well, I hope you mean that literally. I can't be flying up here every time I need your fabulous brain. I've been pulling strings since you left. One of them gave. This is just a confirmation letter. My visa! My visa, you got me back my visa! Michael! Oh my god! Thank you. Really missed you. I'm going to New York! ♪ Today is the day ♪ ♪ I'm starting to see ♪ ♪ Just where I'm from ♪ ♪ Where I want to be ♪ Oh, he's so adorable. He could start my biological clock. But how did you end up with a fat baby? Oh, you're the little guy that just about sunk my magazine, aren't you? Yes you are, yes you are. Fran. Yes. Now you've done a terrific job with Tate, and because I'm full and contain the multitudes, I'm going to forgive you all the screw ups. And what is this? Your new office. I'm giving you a sort of promotion. You're going to take over Veniva responsibilities. And does this sort of promotion come with a sort of raise? We've missed that dry sense of humor around here. Hi. You look good. Oh. Different. Thanks. Hi, how are you? Hi, how are you? So how do you want to do this? Well, I figure I'm off work before most of your gigs start so I could drop him off in the morning and come get him around dinner, if that's okay with you. Fine. Bands got a tour coming up pretty soon so I need to find someone to cover while I'm away. Yeah, it should be no problem. So how have you been? I should go. I'm meeting someone. Okay. Bye, sweet pea. Okay. Frannie, this is the part where you have to let him go. Yeah. Hey. I'm really glad you got your job back. I know what it means to you. God save me from a small life or a small love, from minivans and mediocrity, and from my suspicion that in the end the search is always better than the find. Well... It's amazing. It's depressing. It is. Well, don't hold back now. Well, I'm just, how can a life be small if it makes you happy? Or reverse the question. How can it make you happy if it's small? Because there's a difference between being small and being empty. Is there? Well, what happened to the Frannie that demanded something exceptional from life? Oh look, don't worry about me, okay? I don't plan on settling for anything less than my kind of perfect. I'll hold you to that. So. This is it. The last article. Assuming you're signing off. Of course, of course. Michael, it's really, really great. Thanks. Now I'm on book tour this week, but I hear that Halsford's throwing a party for me when I return. I assume you're going to be there? Oh, absolutely. Good. All right, bye. Try not to get pregnant again before I get back. Yeah. Uh, is Calvin here? He's playing with his kid. Okay. Who is the greatest spud in the world? Who is the greatest spud in the whole world, mister? Is it you? Makes me want to dance, how about you? I'm gonna' turn you and I dip you and I turn and I punch you. What? Hi. Cal, this looks amazing. Got take him already, huh? Guess we we're havin' too much fun, big man. It'll have to last us, but I promise I will write you new songs on the bus, okay? Hello. So, when are you leaving? Next week. I still have to pack. Can I ask you a question? The other day in the park, what did you mean? Do I really uh, look different? Completely, he's changed you. I can see it. I hope you don't mean the stretch marks. I was talking a little deeper of things. Yeah. You've always been beautiful Frannie, but uh, now you, I don't know, now you have grace. Cal, come on already. We're late. Gotta go. Come on, I'll walk you two out. Is she a smoker? Come on spudly. 'Cause she looks like a smoker. Frannie. I'm just saying, you know. If you're going to have prancing naked thigh girl around our son, I'd prefer it if she put some pants on before she touched him. I'll have her put her pants on. Good. Excuse me, can I get a gimlet? Make it a double. Hey handsome, whatcha' drinkin'? So, ladies and gentlemen. The time has come to bid a fond farewell to the inimitable Michael Tate. We hate to see him leave but we're going to pass the torch to our next guest essayist who will be chosen by our new feature's editor, the ever charming Francesca Mackenzie. Who managed not to screw everything up after all. I'm just gonna' go over here. Okay. Well, congratulations Ms. feature's editor. Why thank you. So I guess this brings to an end our literary affair, huh? Well, I for one am thrilled to have the work behind us. Oh, I see you're glad to be rid of me are ya? Completely the opposite, actually. But I think you knew that. I also think, we've waited too long for a second date. Don't you? Thing is, Frannie, I don't think I've ever met a woman who understood my mind as well as you do. What about Lester? I have to admit, at first the whole single mom thing was a bit exotic. But um, you make it worth trying. And seriously, he's a great kid. I mean you hardly know he's there. So Michael, we're waiting for a few words of wisdom. Yeah. Let's face it, we're attracted, we're like minded, and the job's over. So, I can't think of one good reason why we shouldn't be together. Can you? I don't know, what the hell am I up here talkin' to myself? Duty calls. - Congratulations. - Thank you very much. Thank you, thank you very much. It's very kind. Well despite a few hiccups along the way. Okay, he just kissed you in public, I think that's legally binding. All right, you just got a promotion and Mr. Pulitzer all within five minutes. If I didn't love you, I'm telling you I would hate you. Yeah, everything is um, perfect. What? Look at me. Why are there tears? No, no, no. No there should be no tears. Just hold Les, okay? Oh, here. Hey, you hold this. Frannie. Frannie. Hey, oh honey. Oh baby please tell me those are tears of joy. 'Fraid not, no. Okay, talk to me. What's going on? I'm kind of realizing that I probably made the biggest mistake of my life. What? Do you remember how we used to go on all those lousy dates and talk about how great it would be to finally find the guy. Yeah. Well, I found him. But I let him go. Okay, honey I'm not following you. Okay, you know that I've been dreaming for the perfect guy since I was 16 years old. And Michael is everything that I thought I wanted, but Calvin is the one that I belong with. Are you sure? Are you really, really sure? Mm-hmm. Well then honey, you've got to tell him. I can't tell him! He's leaving on tour, he's going to Europe and he's dating this blonde girl with thighs like a 13 year old Russian athlete. Uh-uh, Kournikova doesn't get him, you've got dibs. When's he leaving? Any minute now. What are we doing standing here? Marina. Taxi! Oh no, no, no. I can't get him on my cell phone. Okay, we're gonna' make a run for it and take a shortcut through the park, let's go. Okay. Okay. This is so exciting, I feel like Julia Roberts. This way. Even if we catch him, what the hell am I supposed to say? Not a freakin' clue, more running, less talking. Get out of the way, people! Watch out people, we've got a woman in love coming through. We've got a woman in love coming through! Excuse me! You go, you go, go. Keep going! Keep going! Move! Go honey! ♪ Looking back on all that trip to find ♪ ♪ Summer days are missing you ♪ Move please! ♪ And all I want is to see you ♪ ♪ All I want is to see you tonight ♪ ♪ Tonight ♪ ♪ Tonight ♪ ♪ And all I want is to see you ♪ Where is Calvin? Just missed him in the first van. Maybe he's upstairs packing the amps. Think. Just think! Upstairs, packing the amps. Thank you, thank you. Okay, okay. Okay Lester, I want you to remember this moment. I want you tell your grandchildren that your mother may not have been sane, she may not have been perfect, but she never gave up when it counted. Calvin! Cal? Calvin! Calvin Harver Putty! Please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please be up here. Calvin? Cal? Calvin? Frannie? Cal? What are you guys doin' here? I have to leave. Okay, look don't go. Look I haven't thought this through so just let me wing it. Okay, I'm an idiot Calvin. I always thought that I would fall in love at first sight, but I guess I had to look at you twice because you're not the guy I thought you'd be. Thanks. No, no that's a good thing because I'm not who I thought I'd be. Go on. Okay. The thing is, what I'm trying to say in essence is that is that I love you, Cal. And it's not just because of Lester, it's because you hear a world that I'm deaf to. That, that you loved our son before you even met him, that you loved me even though I was stupid and crazy and scared. So I guess, I guess now um, the question is can you take me back or am I too late? Because I know that I can be a lot to handle and that I'm asking you to give up the blonde prancing naked thigh girl for a life of diapers and chaos. Frannie. She's dating my drummer. Now, ask me a question again. Will you take me back? I never really let you go. Okay, so maybe I don't have the castle yet, but I finally found my own happily ever after. Oh sweetie, Lester. We all know the nursery rhyme, first comes love, then comes baby. Okay, so as usual I screwed it up and got it backwards. But it doesn't really matter how it starts, all that truly matters is how it ends. Because the truth is happy endings do exist, maybe not how we always expected them, but that just makes it a thousand times better. ♪ Today is the day ♪ ♪ I'm starting to see ♪ ♪ Just where I'm from ♪ ♪ Where I want to be ♪ ♪ I think I'll be okay with you ♪ ♪ I know you feel the same way too ♪ ♪ Here I am to stay ♪
