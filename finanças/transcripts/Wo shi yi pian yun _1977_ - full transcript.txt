Mom. Where did I come from? Well... You came from the center of a rose flower. Then what about my big brother? He was plucked by us from an apple tree. Zhaopei. What do you want to be when you grow up? I want to be a car driver. Wanlu, what about you? Me? I want to be a cloud. I'm a cloud. The sky is my home. I greet the sun at dawn. I see off the sunset at dusk. I'm a cloud. I'm unrestrained and carefree. My body flies with my soul and dream. It comes and goes without any worry. I'm a cloud. The sky is my home. My body flies with my soul and dream. It comes and goes without any worry. You should buy some Patriots Lottery today. You'll definitely win. Thank you for reminding me. Should I share half of the prize money with you? Don't get mad. Don't you know that weather can change in a matter of minutes, every day may bring fortune or calamity. It was invented just for this kind of accident. I never heard that football already exists when idioms were invented. Throw back the ball please! Throw it back! Throw it back! Throw it back! Thanks. Thank you. Throw it back! Do you always smile a lot? Is wrong to smile a lot? Are you always an angry person? I was angry? When you fell on the floor just now, you were angry like a devil. I was being a lady, otherwise I'd kick your ass. So you spared me some ass-kicking. Give me back the books, I'll make a turn here. What's your name? My name is "A Cloud". A Cloud? Cloud from "unpredictable thunderstorm clouds"? Maybe. Then my name is "A Gust of Wind" Also from the "unpredictable thunderstorm" Goodbye, Duan Wanlu. How do you know I'm Duan Wanlu. I might have some psychic abilities. As long as I look at a person from head to toe, I'll know his or her name. Nonsense! Guess who I am. That's impossible! Youlan. It couldn't be you! Why not? I thought you're attending college in the US. When did you come back? Yesterday. Yesterday? Why didn't you tell us beforehand? I waited till now to surprise you today. What's this? Kumquat Rain, a kind of flower. Can't you talk inside the house? You won't finish talking in three days about stuff that happened during the 4 years. Wanlu, the whole family is waiting for you to cut the birthday cake. Happy birthday! Happy birthday! Hand me a plate. Wanlu. Are you happy with the birthday present I gave you? What birthday present? Gu Youlan. You... Youlan. I'm warning you. Stay away from my little sister. She's agressive and bossy, with no feminine tenderness at all. Of course. I'm no match for your Li Bingbing. She's full of feminine tenderness. It's just her feminine tenderness is not intended for you alone. Wanlu. You two just can't stop bickering. I'm sorry, Bingbing. Wanlu. Dad. What's the matter with me? I act like a derailed locomotive today, crashing with everyone I meet. Not just today. I think you act like a derailed locomotive every day. Today you've turned 20, and you're still like a child. Dad. Wanlu is spoiled by you guys. Let's see what she'll do when she needs to be independent one day. Why would I live independently? I'll live with mom and dad forever, right? You won't even get married? I won't get married. Great! Youlan. Listen to this. She won't get married all her life. I'm afraid someone would get hurt by this. You... Keep joking around about me, I'll uncover some of your secrets. I don't have any secrets. Come on. Bingbing. I'll tell you something. I need to whisper it to you. Let me tell you... Bingbing. Don't listen to her! My naughty sister would make up stories. She has nothing nice to say. I find it pretty nice. What did she say? She said... Grandpa Moon gives out his brightness. Ride a horse and burn an incense. I don't remember the rest of them. Wanlu. Do you know why I came back to our country? You've got your degree, why wouldn't you? The most important reason is... ��Duan Wanlu�� No wonder. I wrote my name on it. I almost believed he's a psychic. My lazy daughter. You're still in bed? It's almost noon now. I don't have any class this morning. I know that. But your graduation test is coming soon. I forgot about it! I promised to go studying in Chen Meiying's house. I need to tell you about something. The job your father got you is already confirmed. The Crown Magazine is hiring you as a journalist. Really? Of course. They're waiting for you to graduate. Great! They don't care that I only graduated from a Technical College? It doesn't matter which college you went to. It only matters if you're up to the task. Mom. Just rest assured. I'm actually a little concerned. You have too many random thoughts. When you interview somebody, you might ignore the questions you should be asking and stick to the stuff that you should not. No one knows a daughter better than her own mother. I won the lottery. You don't remember me? I'm "the wind". I went to buy the lottery, and I won the prize. Now I'll keep my promise that I'll split it with you. Get out of here. I don't believe you actually won the lottery. You don't believe me? Go to the lottery bank and claim the prize. What a shame! You only won the last two characters. I still won, didn't I? You're a fool. I'm a fool? Why am I a fool? You only bought one. Of course you'd only win a small amount. If you buy 100 of them, I bet you'll win the top grand prize. You're right. Maybe I should purchase all the lottery tickets from Bank Of Taiwan. Then every one of the dozens of prizes will belong to me. This might be a great solution. You don't say. You surely have some talent in maths. I never saw any girl smiling so much like you. How are you going to deal with it? Change into two lottery tickets. One for each of us. Sure. Meng Qiao. Is this your name? Yes. You can't call me "a gust of wind" forever, can you? This one is yours. Call me if you win a prize. Then leave your phone number on my ticket please. I can call you if I win. Do you have to do so much to get my telephone number? You can see I've given it a lot of thought. Are you a student? I have a job. Then you're definitely not very hard-working. Why? It's not Sunday today. And it's 11 a.m. right now. You don't go to work, but sit in a cafe drinking coffee with a girl you didn't know. ��An Introduction to Journalism�� You're good at reasoning. You'll become a good journalist. You have an eye for detail. In my opinion, you should be a journalist. You're correct. I am a journalist. I graduated from NCCU, majoring in journalism. Now I'm working at a newspaper, reporting news in the field every day. You're a journalism major too? How long since you've become a journalist? Three years. So this is the first time you invite a girl for coffee during three years? So you're an excellent liar too. Believe it or not, I never lie. Since this is your first time, why did you choose me, not somebody else? I don't think I was ever hit by other girl's ball before. My mother always says that there's an aperture missing in my head. That ball of yours must've cracked open that aperture in my head. Your head may be missing one aperture. But my head has 18 apertures missing. And until now nobody ever hit me with a ball. I need to go now. Let's just end it here. Bye. Why're you taking me to the suburb? To solve the problem of "affection". I don't follow you. Yes you do. You have a powerful weapon. You feign innocence to disguise yourself. Even if you're still a child, you need someone to help you grow up. I don't need to grow up. And I don't need anyone to help me grow up. I'll maintain the real self. It's not a bad thing to grow up. We had a great time when we were little. We can still be together when we grow up. Stop talking. What's the matter? Listen, a cicada is chirping. You're right. There is a cicada. I used to catch one for you when we were young. You carried it along with a small cage. And you asked around Cicada, cicada, what do you actually know? And those fireworms. My brother and you put hundreds of fireworms into my mosquito net, and call me "princess fireworm". Until now, I never ever forget the way you look then. Stop playing hide-and-seek with me. You are killing me. What do you mean? Only a fool wouldn't know what I mean. Wanlu. Wanlu. Wanlu. You are a bully. Who gave you the right to do so? You took advantage of me. I won't talk to you anymore. God knows. When did I bully you? As long as you have a heart, you would know my feeling for you! I... you're not made of wood, or stone. How come you have no feeling at all? I don't want to know. Great! You don't want to know. It's not that you haven't grown up, or you know nothing about feeling. You just don't have feeling for me, right? Tell me. I... I... Don't tell me. I don't even have the courage to know. Don't tell me why. Please leave me with a little hope. I wanna go home. Mrs. Xu, let's talk about this another day. My daughter has come back. Dad. Mom. Wanlu. These are your Uncle Xu and Auntie Xu. Uncle Xu. Auntie Xu. Bonian. She's so adorable. And so pretty too. Good. Good. Wanlu. You seem very tired. Go take a rest upstairs. Bye, Uncle Xu. Auntie Xu. Hello. I'm Meng. I'd like to talk to miss Wanlu please. Wanlu. That guy named Meng is calling you again. Should I say you are here or not? Shall I reject him for you? Brother. Mind your own business. It's almost 8. Are you still not going to work? None of your business. Hi. Could we meed today? When? I need to report news all day. How about noon? No, not noon. There's a reception I have to attend. Then the afternoon. No, I can't make it too. Come on! What's the matter with you? I'm not your servant. When you have the time, I might not be free then. Then how about tomorrow night? I'll be free after I return my news release. Eight p.m. I'll wait for you at Cafe Yaxu. I'll stay put until you arrive. Eight o'clock tomorrow evening? Wanlu. Don't joke around please. We decided to go dancing in Guohua club. Don't break the appointment with Gu Youlan. Wanlu. Wanlu. I must see you tonight.. I'll wait for you at Cafe Yaxu. Come or not suit yourself. Either way I won't leave Yaxu the whole night. You waited for me for a long time? Yes I did. Where did you come from? From home? Do you think I come from home dressing like this? I came from Huaguo. Let me tell you something. I have known a boy since I was a child. His name is Gu Youlan. I was dancing with him just now. Him, my elder brother and his girlfriend. We were having a great time. However, I knew you were here. I told them that I needed to go the bathroom. Then I took a taxi and came here. Now you see, I was determined not to come. But I still came. Enough! Keep reading like this, you'll completely see through me. Why do you like me? Because you're like a cloud. I've never met a girl so free-spirited just a like a cloud. Don't you know that cloud is ethereal? You can never catch a cloud. Really? Let's get out of here. To go where? Go for a walk outside. I've been sitting here for three hours. Guide you across the ocean. Hold you and fly to the sky. If you, if you are a cloud, I must be, I must be a gust of wind, lifting you up to go over the mountains, holding you in arms and going towards the rainbow. Do me a favor, please. What? Don't go to your childhood sweetheart. Don't you think this request is too much? Then could you do me another favor? Close your eyes. Why? They're too bright. Close them. Just for a few seconds. If you, if you are a cloud, I must be, I must be a gust of wind, lifting you up to go over the mountains, confiding all the concerns in my mind. What's wrong with the kid? What else? Because of Wanlu. I think we should invite Wanlu to our house for a gathering. Let's set the rules. - Whoever loses treats the winner. - OK. You can't undo a false move. Come on! Me? Undo a false move? Refrain yourself from swearing when you lose. Let's play another game of chess. Let's make it three games. Huizhong. Next life when we marry someone never choose chess enthusiasts. Wanlu. Why don't you come to our house often recently? I'm here now, aren't I? She recently got a job. She's only free on Sundays. Wanlu. Come to my room for a while. No I won't. I want to show you something. I don't want to see it. Youlan. Do not show Wanlu that thing. Wanlu is very timid. Especially of animals. She'll be scared by that. What animal do you keep? You can't tell her. Youlan. What is it? He can't tell you. Heaven secrets mustn't be divulged. I know. You guys are trying to fool me. Who would fool you? Youlan kept an owl. Really? Please stay for a minute. Why are you lying to me? Where is the owl? I think you're like an owl, cunning and manipulative. I didn't say I have an owl. Zhaopei said it. Both of you are bad guys. Fine. So I'm a bad guy. Just leave. I didn't know only an owl can make you stay. If I knew it, rather than merely one owl, I'd raise ten if you like. What did you want to show me? Now it doesn't matter any more. You don't have to see it. I want to see it. Wanlu. I will die for you eventually. Stop the nonsense. I picked this up from your hair on your 20th birthday. You told me it was Kumquat Rain. I'd rather say it's two drops of Lovesick Rain. Youlan. Don't do this. You'll make me cry. Will you cry for me? Please don't, Youlan. It's because of that journalist? I won't give up on this. Wanlu. I'll wait until the end of this story. Do you remember me, Wanlu? I'm sorry, you are... I went to your home once. You must've forgot. I'm your Auntie Xu. Auntie Xu. Wanlu. You're working here? Yes. Is it hard? Not at all. By the way, do you need me to find you another job? No. I'm satisfied with my current job. Would you like to go to my house to hang out? You mean now? I can't. I'm waiting for someone. Look at this. What a pretty hand. You don't even have a ring. Here. Auntie Xu's first meeting gift for you. I intended to give it to you last time in your house. What's going on here? - Take it. - Auntie Xu. Let go of my hand. I never take gifts from people. Wanlu. Sorry, I'm late. Let's go. Who is that woman just now? Pulling and dragging you repeatedly? A mental case. So called "Auntie Xu". A friend of my mom's. She bumped into me on the street, and insisted on giving me a gemstone ring. Is there such strange thing in the world? Does this Auntie Xu have a son? How would I know? Don't kick the pebble. Why not? If it hits someone on his head, then I'll have one more love rival. I'm hungry. Where are we going to eat? At my house. No I won't. I'm scared of meeting parents. You must go. My mom will cook by herself. She made you many dishes. She's eager to meet you. Wanlu. She's the most independent most hard-working mom in the world, and with the most depth. She knew me the best. She's awe-inspiring and benign at the same time. She's not scary at all. Your words made me even more scared. Why is that? You admire your mother so much. She must be a great woman. I'm scared great things. Because I'm a very small person. Don't be ridiculous. Go meet my mom immediately. So this is Wanlu? Yes. Auntie. Qiaoqiao talks about you a lot. It feels I already know you. Why do you come so late? The dinner is already cold after the long wait. We walked home, that's why we're late. You look good. Prettier than I expected. Come. Let's sit there. You're prettier than I thought too. I was too scared to come. Meng Qiao said that you're awe-inspiring. I'm scared of awe-inspiring person. But the way I see it, you're not awe-inspiring, but young and beautiful. I admire you a lot. Admire me for what? That you could live by yourself for 20 years. I couldn't do it if I were you. You're very straight-forward. I offend people very easily. This is the way she talks. She offended people the first time she interviewed someone. What happened? I don't know how to lie. Let's eat. Should I help your mom with plates and chopsticks? You don't have to help me. I'm guessing you don't do housework at home? You got me. My mom pampers me. She never made me do any chores. It seems you're a blessed girl. I wonder which fortunate man would marry you. This is just how this world works. Blessed people are taken care of. People with less luck have to take care of others. Mom. I'll assist you. Never. Men who cooks are losers. Not to mention you have a distinguished guest. Go wash your face and get ready to eat. Go in there to help her. Auntie. I'll help you. How can I help? I don't know. Tell me what I should do. Then I'll do it. You could sit on the table outside. And wait for the dinner I prepared. You're destined to be wealthy and privileged. And I'm destined to toil and moil. Auntie. You... what do you mean by that? What's the matter? You're our guest. I dare not tire you out. Don't stand in here. Don't get exposed to oil fume. Just go out. Do not suffer it in here. Wanlu. What's wrong? Wanlu. Maybe I'm not a very sensible girl. Maybe I'm crude and careless. But I know one thing: when you're not welcomed, you should leave. Wanlu. Qiaoqiao. - Wanlu. - Qiaoqiao. What did I do wrong? Where did I offend her? I tried so hard to please her. I even cooked many dishes for her. Why did she act like this? Wanlu. Wanlu. What do you want? I'd like to talk to you. I need to go to work. I don't have the time. Just take a day off. Take a day off? You want me to be unemployed? Take a day off. I'm begging you. Wanlu. What's wrong with us? What's the problem? Your mother. Stop making troubles. My mother is not a picky woman She's very kind. As long as you do not throw temper tantrums, she will like you. I am a bit childish, but I can sensitively detect if someone loves me. Meng Qiao. Your mother doesn't like me at all. She even hates me. Nonsense. You're too spoiled. My mom conceals her real feeling. And you misunderstood her. You stormed out like that. She didn't even know where she offended you. She knew. Of course she knew. She drove me away intentionally. She didn't know. She's generous and kind. She will forgive you. She'll forgive me too. Never mind. I don't care if she forgive me or not. I'm the one being hurt, not her. Wanlu. You cannot tream my mother like this. She remained a widow for over two decades and endured a lot of hardship to raise me up. She doesn't deserve to be offended by my girlfriend. As younger generation, we at least should respect the elders. I get it now. You need a puppet to be your a girlfriend. A puppet with ropes on her head, feet and hands. And your mother operates those ropes. She only has to pull it to move her. And everybody is happy. Go find a puppet to be your girlfriend. Wanlu. Wanlu. Wanlu. Could you do me a favor? What do you want me to do? Go apologize to my mom at my home. Go apologize to your mom at your home. Yes. If you still love me. I won't go. You must go. I won't. Are you sure? I'm sure. Do it for me. No. You know what. You doing this means... Means what? Means it's all over between us. Come here. What? Take your clothes away. Meeting you is my greatest bad luck. Why did God let me meet you? I used to be happy. I was carefree. I have people loving me, caring for me. Why they let me meet you? I'm defeated. Meng Qiao. I agree to apologize to your mom, not because I did anything wrong, but because I love you. I'm a cloud. The sky is my home. I greet the sun at dawn. I see off the sunset at dusk. Wanlu. Auntie. Wanlu. I thought you'd never come to my home again. Auntie. I'm here to apologize to you. Apologize? What is there to apologize for? I wasn't being polite last time. I left without saying goodbye and made you mad. Nonsense. When was I ever mad at you? I'm happy you're not mad at me. Qiaoqiao. What're you doing standing there? Wanlu is the guest of this home. Go buy some soda. Auntie, you don't have to. Just go. I'm going right away. Come on, let's go sit in the living room. Why are you dressed so formal? Looks like you're going to a nightclub. You look so dazzling. It made our house look bleak. I thought you would like it. A girl only needs to be clean and neat. If you dress yourself too seductively, I'm afraid my Qiaoqiao is not worthy of you. You're pretty and outgoing, good at dressing up. I heard you got loads of boyfriends. Auntie. I don't have loads of boyfriends. Although mom and dad love me dearly, they're strict with me. Really? You know, Qiaoqiao was disciplined by me strictly. He's not good at making girlfriends. He's an honest man. He is not scheming. He doesn't know any trick. He's different from those other dandy boyfriends of yours. How do you know I have other dandy boyfriends? You do, don't you? I'll never believe Qiaoqiao is your only boyfriend. You're newfashioned. You're modern. I met a lot of girls like you. I'm serious. I must protect my son. I'm afraid he's not that powerful to make a wild girl like you settle down. Auntie. Please don't get me wrong. Though I'm a willful girl, I was never wild in any way. You have wild eyes. Do you know that? I... I also have a wild nose, a wild mouth. I have millions of wild cells in my body, and numerous wild hairs. What a sharp tongue! Since the first time we met I knew you're not an ordinary girl. Last time you dressed like a thug. This time you look like a bargirl. My son is healthy and outstanding. I won't allow him to go astray. Look at you. You look nothing like a college professor's daughter. You're lack of manners. Frivolous and vain from head to toe. You... Soda, coke and apple cider. You name it! Wanlu. What's the matter this time? Qiaoqiao. You are a good son. You are filial and obedient. Please spare me such burden. Your mother is old now. She has no ability to please your girlfriend any more. Wanlu. What's with you this time? Did you forget what you're here for? You're apologizing, right? Why are you doing this again? Qiaoqiao. Just take Wanlu home. I'm sorry. I think this is just not meant to be. Wanlu. Say something. Why do you go against my mother over and over again? Why? Why? Why? Meng Qiao. You don't have to tell me that we are over now. Because in my mind, we're over. Wanlu. Let's make it clear before you leave. What do you mean? Because you have a very very very good mother. And you are a very very very good son. So I'm not up to the standard to be your girlfriend. Please let go of me and let me leave. Or I might say something very unpleasant. Wanlu. Qiaoqiao. Mrs. Xu. I'm begging you. Don't do this. Wanlu lives a very happy life. She couldn't accept such a fact. She's my daughter. I know her. Mrs. Duan. Don't get it wrong please. Wanlu is my daughter. I gave birth to her. Mom! Mom. I want to know the truth. Mr. and Mrs. Duan. I know you have good hearts. And you do good deeds. My daughter was born on May 20. Her father treats me badly. He won't marry me. He's gone completely. I'm 19 years old. My mother didn't want me. I had no other choice but be a dancer. This child is sick. I can't raise her. Please take her. Do a good deed and raise her up. The Bodhisattva will bless you. This is how you came to this home. Since that day, you became the center of the family. We loved you, spoiled you and hid the truth. Year after year, we love you more and more. Who knows after you turned 20, Mrs. Xu suddenly showed up. The Auntie Xu yu saw the other night, she is indeed your biological mother. In order to prove this, she recited every word on that note to us. Wanlu. Though she has very little education, she memorized each every word. You can see this note must've played an important role in her heart. All these years, you and Zhaopei are as precious as my own life. How could I just let her take you back? But I'm in a dilemma. I'm in pain. After all, she's your birth mother. She's conflicted and she made efforts for you. Adoptive mother is your mother. Birth mother is also your mother, isn't she? Wanlu. You should think this through. We've brought you up for 20 year. We're not pitying you. It's because you brought us a lot of joy. Even with big fortune couldn't buy us such joy. As for your birth mom, she also needs you. You're a legal adult now. You can either choose your birth mother or choose to stay with us. You must calm down, and think about your future. Why didn't you just let me die on the steps? Why did you adopt me? Why did you bring me up? You shouldn't keep me, educate me. And you shouldn't lie to me for 20 years. Why didn't you just let me die? Why didn't just let me die? Did we do anything wrong? Did we ever do anything wrong? Stop it! Wanlu. Are you insane? Why do you blame mom and dad? Because they raised you? Educated you? Took care of you? Is it a crime to raise you? Dad. Mom. Go downstairs for a while. I'd like to talk to Wanlu privately. Alright. It's easier to talk it through as fellow youngsters. Just have a chat. Wanlu. Don't you think it's unfair to tell mom and dad those words? You don't have to say anything. You are their son. Of course you are loved by them. You don't have to wait until 20 to find out you're deserted, and to choose between birth parent and adoptive parents. Don't scream. Listen to me. Mom has heart disease since childhood. She's unable to bear children. She couldn't give birth to you or me. Brother. You don't have to lie to me like this. I'm not lying to you. When I was 18 years old, I accidently found a diagnosis note saying mom couldn't bear children. Then I went straight to ask dad. Dad didn't hide from me. I was brought back from an orphanage. You talked about birth parents and adoptive parents. You know giving birth is often accidental. But raising a child needs a great deal of patience and love. After I thought this through, I feel only love, no hate. I love our mom and dad. Because they really love us, then they decided to bring us home. Do you understand now? From that moment I knew I'm the son of Duan Lisen and Wu Huizhong. I'm proud of them. I'm honored to be their son. And I don't care about anything else. Wanlu. Mom never lied to us. You came from the center of rose flower. I was plucked from an apple tree. Right? Dad. Mom. I love you both! I want you both! Forever and ever! Wanlu. Youlan. What's the matter with you? You don't look very good. Broke up with girlfriend? Youlan. Wanlu already knew about her birth. How come? I thought you guys hid it from her. I got it. Her birth mother came again. Correct. Anyway last night, all the truths were revealed. Wanlu was hurt badly. You know she's a very sensitive girl. Is she home? She went to work. We advised her to ask for leave. But she insisted on going to work. It's almost time to get off work. OK. I'll go pick her up. Wanlu. Marry me. You're asking me to marry you. Yes. Do you know you chose the worst moment? I have no emotion at the moment. Think about it. Take your time. God bless you. Wanlu. God bless me? What is there to be blessed with? Because I'm an abandoned child? Because I'm a dancer's daughter? Because I have a pair of wild eyes? Wild eyes? What does this mean? I don't get it. You don't have to get it. Youlan. What do I do? What should I do? I understand your feeling right now. During the last 20 years, you thought you're Duan Lisen's daughter. You pursued a higher education. Knowledge gave you a sense of superiority. And then suddenly, you found yourself the daughter of a dancer out of wedlock. So you feel inferior. Do not let this bother you. Being a dancer's daughter is nothing to be ashamed of. Dancers are like anyone of us. They can also be respectable. Besides, if you're Duan Lisen's daughter, I love you. If you're a dancer's daughter, I love you. If you're a pedlar's daughter, I still love you. Youlan. You're comforting me. Don't get wet in the rain. I love it. What do you have to say? Just say it. You are cold to me. What happened to you lately? You dodged me, refused to meet me. You avoid me. I've told you already. We're over. I don't understand why are you still pestering me. Because it's not over between us. Because I love you. Because I want you. Because I will marry you. What did you say? I will marry you. I have decided. Let's get married immediately. The newspaper is sending me to the US for 3 months. You should go too. Let's go there for our honeymoon. You're lying. You're lying. You're lying. I'm not lying. You're lying. She'll never agree. Your mother doen't like me. She doen't like me at all. Go home with me right now. Let's get things straightened out. My mom said it's not that she doesn't like you. She just wants you to settle down. If you marry me, she'll do her best to love you. She'll do her best to love me? Would she say such a thing? If she doesn't like you, will she want you to be her daughter-in-law? Meng Qiao. It's my fault. I was wrong about your mother. I was too childish. If she would forgive me, I'll be the best daughter-in-law. Then what are we waiting for? Let's meet my mom. To tell her that you'll become a member of Meng's family. Qiaoqiao. Why are you so inconsiderate? You let her get wet. Auntie. It's not his fault. I love getting wet in the rain. It's not his fault? He got wet with you. You must correct such wierd behavior in the future. Come here and sit. Since we're talking about getting married, I have to talk to you. Marriage is not a game. It's not just about love. You can't quarrel with each other at will. Getting married means being responsible. Right. Auntie. Look at me. This needs to be corrected too. What needs to be corrected? Wanlu. I'm not picking on you. Being frivolous is biggest taboo for a girl. When you're talking to me, you can't glance at somebody else. It's very rude. Alright, Auntie. Since you're willing to be married into Meng's familiy, you should know our rules. We only take in girls with good manners and very cultivated. Honestly speaking, Many conditions of yours don't meet my requirements. Auntie. You did it again. Wanlu. First you need to learn how to look steadily forward. You know what? The biggest flaw on your face is your eyes. I know. I have a pair of wild eyes. You told me last time. It's good that you know it. But it doesn't matter. Just always remind yourself. Do not ogle with your eyes. Especially with men. Auntie I never ogle. This needs to be corrected too. What? When elders speak, do not cut in, or interrupt. This is the basic courtesy. Didn't your father teach you about it? Look up. Look at me. Don't bow your head when I'm talking to you. OK? Like I just said, a lot of your conditions don't fit my requirements. But Qiaoqiao is obsessed with you. So I have to accept this. Through gradual training and influencing, I believe I can carve a gem out of this insensate stone. You have a fairly good foundation. Not quite. What are you saying? Do you have to interrupt me? If you don't want to be well-behaved, how can you be our daughter-in-law? Look! You are looking away again. I don't want a daughter-in-law that'll bring shame to this family. Mom. What's the matter? Wanlu didn't do anything wrong. Why lecturing her incessantly? Qiaoqiao. I just want to make things clear. So we'd get along as mother-in-law and daughter-in-law. I didn't expect that Wanlu hasn't married you yet, I've already lost my right to speak. Mom. Why are you talk like this? OK. Fine. It was my fault. I won't chip in any more. Speak any way you like. It's all my fault. OK? I won't speak again. I'm in no position to speak. Mom. Do not get mad, alright? We're talking about getting married. It's supposed to be a happy event. Happy event? Yes. It is a happy event. Wanlu is a famous professor's daughter. I'm only an uneducated old hag. Mom. What's my position to teach her how to behave? I believe before you allow me to marry Meng Qiao, there's one thing you should know first. I'm not the biological daughter of Duan Lisen. I was adopted by them. I don't know my biological father. My birth mother is a dancer. What? Qiaoqiao. What a "great" girlfriend you have! Even your dead father will get mad in his coffin. I remain a widow for 20 years to raise you, and you try to marry a low and degrading girl with suspicious family background, to disgrace our Meng house? Wanlu. Don't talk nonsense. Why are you making up such a ridiculous story? Meng Qiao. So you're just like your mother. You value my family background more than who I am. You are Joan of Arc. You're sacred. You're noble. You're pure. You remain a widow for 20 years, so you're great. So you should talk about it every day. You being a widow is your son's fault. You did him a favor. So he owes you. He's destined to be your slave for life. Qiaoqiao. Get a knife. Just kill me. Why don't you kill me with a knife? Wanlu. Are you crazy? How could you curse my mother like this? When did I curse your mother? I didn't call her a witch. - I didn't call her a devil. - Wanlu. I didn't call her a psychopath. I didn't call her... You hit me? You hit me? Dad. Mom. Come here! What happened? Wanlu. Auntie Gu. I'm the illegitimate daughter of a dancer. Would you forbid your son to marry me? What's the nonsense? We love you. We want you. We don't care about your background. How about you, Uncle Gu? Why are you still asking? Our whole family has been waiting for years for you to grow up. Youlan. I have made up my mind. You can marry me any day you want. Don't assume I'm being impulsive. Don't assume I'm not in my right mind. I'm sober and very aware. I wish to be a best wife of yours. Wanlu. Mrs. Xu. Please sit for a while. Wanlu is coming down right away. Wanlu. You are sick. I'll find you a doctor, the best doctor. Mrs. Xu. We used to have a happy family. Now you ruined it completely. Could you stop harassing Wanlu? - You... - Brother. Please. Don't. Auntie Xu. Please sit down. Let's talk about it. Wanlu. You don't feel good. Don't get excited. Dad. Don't worry. I think since it happened, three sides of us never discussed about it together. Auntie Xu is here today. I'd like to make it clear. Auntie Xu. They are my dad and mom. 21 years ago, you gave me to them. And they kept their promise. They brought me up. They loved me with their hearts all these years. I believe they won't stop loving me in the future. Therefore, Auntie Xu, although you gave birth to me, you'll always be my Auntie Xu. You can't be my mother. Wanlu. But I love you. I know. I love you too. But I'll only recognize the parents who raised me, not the parent gave birth to me. So you mean you'll never see me again? It's meaningless for us to meet again. I don't know how to treat you. And you don't know how to treat me. Wanlu. I know that. But I'll give you a building, a lot of jewelries, and a large amount of money. Auntie Xu. You gave your daughter away. Now you can't buy her back. The definition of love between us has too much difference. If you really love me, don't come here to increase my parents' distress. My mom has lost a lot of weight because of this. Mr. Duan. Mrs. Duan. Thank you. For raising Wanlu into such a wonderful girl. I... I'll leave now. Hold on. Auntie Xu. Bye. Mommy. I'll go to Duan's house tomorrow. I'll visit her parents myself. To ask Wanlu to marry you. It's too late. She's already married. If you are a cloud, I must be a gust of wind. What're you staring at? A fish? There was a cloud. A cloud? Now it's gone. It's not gone. A cloud is sitting in front of me. This cloud is finally wife. Youlan. I want to live here forever. Build two cottages. Raise two cows. And have a baby. Life here is so simple. No need to worry or be afraid. Without pride or inferiority. Wanlu. So if we go back to Taipei, you'll be worried or afraid? Face the problem of pride and inferiority? Let me tell you. Don't be afraid anymore. And don't feel inferior. I'll protect you. Nobody could grab you from my arms. What are you thinking about? About what you said today. I said a lot today. Which sentence do you mean? Nobody could grab me from your arms. You think I would sneak away from your arms? Will you? I swore to myself when I married you that I'll be the best wife of the best. Like my mom to my dad. Like your mom to your dad. Zhaopei and Bingbing are here too. Zhaopei. We're joining in the fun. Hope the newly-weds won't hate us. Great! Just enjoy an early honeymoon. You two are getting married in 2 months. Wanlu. Stop kidding around. Come on. Let's check in the room first. We'll treat you for lunch later. OK. Great. Let's go. Youlan. You are awsome. This unruly and eccentric sister of mine seems to go back to her true self again. Let's have a drink when we eat later. No problem. Drink as much as you want. No. We're here to play, not to drink. Our sister-in-law disagree. Youlan. Save some money. You're saving for your husband already. Here. Fill it for us. OK. I'm here to inform you that Meng Qiao went abroad. The newspaper sent you. I bet he'll be gone for at least half a year. Everything will change when he comes back. What're you whispering to your sister? Zhaopei. Stop hogging Wanlu. Youlan will get jealous. Wanlu. Why would you come here? It's boring staying at home. I'd like to walk around here. What were you doing up there? I need to check it when they align the rebars. The scaffold is also called "eagle frame". Why "eagle frame"? I have no idea. Perhaps because it's tall. Only eagle can fly up there. I need to discuss something with you. Sure. Listen to me. Everyone in this family has something to do. Dad goes to work. Mom manages the household. And you. You're the busiest one in the family. I'm the only one left. It seems I'm staying idle all day. Nobody blame you for that. What do you want to do? The newspaper I worked wants me back. I'd like to go back to work. It's a good thing to have a job occupying your time. In fact there is need to discuss with me. You can make the decision yourself, OK? I have to discuss it with you. You're my husband. Meng Qiao. Why are you here? I thought you... Get on my car. I have a lot to say to you. Please get on. I shouldn't have come here with you. The whole family will be looking for me. They're waiting for me to have dinner. Don't panic. I only have a few words. I'll let you go when I'm done. Do I have to listen? Yes. Since that evening, because of a slap in your face, I paid a lot. You stormed out my home. My world was completely scattered. With one cruel fact, getting married, you destroyed all my hope. Until today I don't know you marry him because you love him or to take vengeance on me. You might never know what kind of damage you inflicted on me. When I went abroad, I thought I'll never come back my whole life. When I worked abroad, I made myself busy. Sometimes I let myself go. But I couldn't forget you. When it reached the time limit, I dared not come back. I was aware if I come back, I'll ditch all the ethical, moral codes, conventional ideas and find you. But I missed you. I missed you madly. The extreme yearning eventually overcame everything. I'm back. Now I have to ask you. Are you enjoying your life? Do you feel happy? I should be enjoying my life. I should be happy. I'm not asking if you should or not. I'm asking if you are happy or not. Whether I'm happy or not... What does it have to do with you? It does. I need to know if I still have the chance to pursue the happiness I lost. You don't. Since a long time ago. Really? Is this your true feeling? You didn't even hesitate for a few minutes. Do you know now? I have no self-esteem, no pride whatsoever. I got nothing. I'm begging you. Please tell me your real thought. Don't I have any chance at all? Meng Qiao. You're hurting me. I'm hurting you. That's OK. I hurt you again. I always hurt you. It's the wedding ring that hurts me. Mom. What's the matter with you? Coming home till late at night. Youlan was worried sick. He almost called the police. I'm sorry. I met an old schoolmate on my way back. Even you met an old schoolmate, you shouldn't leave without telephoning us. Sorry. Mom. The point is she's back. Just go to bed. He came to me. You talked with him till now. Talked about what? Things happened before. I can't stop you from talking with your friends about before. But don't talk with him about the past. Because you'll create a future with me, am I right? Listen to me, Wanlu. I'm sincerely offering you a safe and warm harbor. No matter if I successfully did or not, you should know about my sincerity. Wanlu. Is it my arms not safe enough? Not warm enough? No. It's not your problem. It's me. I'm not good enough. I'm not a good girl. Nonsense. Stop saying that. If I cannot protect you well, then it's my fault. Promise me you won't run away, OK? Don't sneak away from me. Wanlu. Meng Qiao. I used to blame you and hate you. But now I don't blame you. I don't hate you any longer. Please forgive me. Forgive me for giving you hope, then disappointing you. I have only one word to say to you. Besides love, one also needs morality and justice, responsibility and family. The combined power of them is stronger than love. So I'm choosing them. Don't find me anymore. Meng Qiao. Bye. Meng Qiao. I'm only a cloud after all. I'll disappear without a trace in a flash. I wish you won't bump into a cloud anymore. Wanlu. Hello. The Crown Magazine. Wanlu. Is that you? Meng Qiao. You're so ruthless. You think you can break up with me forever? I'm not dead yet. How could you say something like this? Could you be a little rational? Rational? If I'm rational, I wouldn't come back from abroad. If I'm rational, I have forgotten about you. If I'm rational, I wouldn't call you again. I'm not rational. I wanna see you right now. No. Meng Qiao. Please don't push me. Please let me live a peaceful life. If I don't bother you, could you really live a peaceful life? Could you really eradicate me completely from your heart? Then... I'm sorry I disturbed you. Goodbye. Hello? Hello? Where are you? You agree to meet me? Yes I do. First ask for leave. I'll wait for you in front of your office in 10 minutes. I'll be there immediately. Listen to the whisper of the pine forest. It's filled with sweetness. We walked through the forest, treading the old tracks of ours. The little things happened in the past are all memories now. We silently huddle together. With love mark in our eyes. The little things happened in the past are all memories now. We silently huddle together. With love mark in our eyes. The little things happened in the past La la la la la... The little things happened in the past are all memories now. Wanlu. I have some words for you. What words? You're a free person. I thought about it all night. If I restrain you with our marriage, then I'm despicable. I'm not that bigoted. So if you really want to leave me, I only need your words. I'll give you five minutes to think about it. I waited for five minutes. You couldn't say it, could you? Wanlu. You'll never know the five minutes feels like five centuries to me. Youlan. Come here for breakfast. Change your clothes. Mom is calling us. Hello. Wanlu. Line two. Did you tell him? I... I didn't. You promised to tell him. Didn't you say your mother would tell him? Why didn't you? My mom wouldn't do it. I... I couldn't do it too. Meng Qiao. Please do not push me anymore. I'm about to crumble. Wanlu. I want to see you and talk to you face-to-face. No, I won't meet you. You changed your mind. Again. You're like a clock pendulum, swaying back and forth again and again. How could you be so weak, so indecisive? You disappoint me. You broke my heart. You're a terrible person. Let me go! I've thought it over. I don't belong to you now. I won't belong to you anymore. Let go of me. I won't go with you. You half-hearted fool! You don't even know what to go after. Wanlu. Wanlu. Use your mind. Use your brain. You can't sway back and forth like a pendulum. You can only belong to one man. If you love me, it'll ruin the three of us if you live with him. Don't you understand? I won't listen to it! I won't listen to it! Let go of me. Let me leave. I was ready to settle down. You ruined it for me again. You're a bastard! You're a rascal! Don't you know that I'm a married woman? I've got somebody else's name. Let me go. Let me go. Calm down. �������� Calm down. - Let me go! - Calm down. Calm down please. Do you want to bite me again? This is a circle. It's the stamp you gave me. I hope it won't disappear. It symbolises I belong to you forever. I had a dream last night. You're a big spiderweb in the dream. And I'm a little moth. I flied towards you. Actually I flied to death. Meng Qiao. You said it before. Love sometimes can kill a person too. Do you really think that I'm a poisonous spiderweb? Youlan. Do you remember the words you said this morning? What words? That if I want to leave you, you won't restrain me with our marriage. Yes, I did say that. What do you want? I want to lea... I'll warn you first. I've almost had enough of you. I'm human too. With human emotion, I can be happy or angry, sad or joyous. I'm gentle to you, doesn't mean you can bully me any way you want. If you dare to say that word... You changed your mind. You just said it this morning. If I want to leave, you just need my word. This morning? The morning has already passed. I gave you five minutes to think about it. You didn't say anything. Now it's already too late. You... Obviously being gentle doesn't work with you. Being patient doesn't work either. You met him again this morning, didn't you? Let me go. Let you go? Why should I let you go? You're my wife, aren't you? Let you go? Let you have an affair with another man? I've had enough! Why should I keep indulging your behavior? Do not push me to do something I'll regret. A cornered beast can't control himself. Do you understand? Why did I still couldn't get your heart when I put in so much for you? You're a cold-hearted monster. Go away! Just go! Go! Go as far as you can. Never let me see you again! Wanlu. Wanlu. Don't go to work today. I'll call in sick for you. I planned to accompany you at home. But something happened on the construction site, I have to go. I'll come back early. I know things between us hasn't ended yet. I'm not avoiding it. But I believe both of us need to calm down and think about it thoroughly. Don't get up. Have a good rest. Forget about everything I said last night. I'll never force you to do something you don't like. Take the time of today to think it over. Youlan. You didn't shave. It doesn't matter. The construction company won't fire me because of that. Will you? Mom. How are you? Are you feeling better? It wasn't a big deal to begin with. Wanlu. Youlan and you grew up together. Getting married was your own idea as well. I just don't get it. Is there anything you're not satisfied with? Mom. Since you're calling me mom today, don't blame me if my words are harsh. You're a married woman, not an unmarried girl anymore. We don't mind your background and everything, but you shouldn't bring shame to us Meng family. Mom. I couldn't interfere the dispute between you two, but I can see Youlan is in pain. Hello. What? Youlan fell off the scaffold. Where? Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital? He's already dead. I'm sorry. Mom. Who's your mom? How dare you call me mom? You killed my son! You're such a degrading bitch! Mom. What's your name? I'm a cloud. Where do you live? I'm a cloud. Mrs. Duan. She's still in this state. She only knows one sentence. In my opinion, medicine and treatment won't help her. She has no hope to recover. Please give this cloud to me. Meng Qiao. What do you want to do? I'll bring her home. She might be like this forever. Do you know that? She won't recover even when she's old or dead. She'll become a lifelong burden to you. I know that. Wanlu said that love itself is a burden. We often live our lives because of these burdens. Leave her to me. What's your name? I'm a cloud. Where do you live? I'm a cloud. I'm a cloud. The sky is my home. I greet the sun at dawn. I see off the sunset at dusk. I'm a cloud. I'm unrestrained and carefree. My body flies with my soul and dream. It comes and goes without any worry.
