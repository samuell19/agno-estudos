Old Enough! We found an unbelievable little errand genius! - - - Can you do it? - Yes. He's only two years and nine months old. That's it! Hold it straight out! Okay, a car's coming! Like this. - That's right. - - - He's definitely responsive... - Okay, off you go. - Okay. "Off you go?" Are you sure this is a good idea, Mom? Trusting his mother that he's more than capable, we followed the sound of his squeaky shoes! Be careful! Yes! Oh? He found something. It's a long stick! I've caught a fish! If you don't mind my saying, your face is more like a baby's than a toddler's! Shall we do some fishing then head home? Ambulance! An ambulance? Well, not quite... KAGOSHIMA PREFECTURE POLICE Ambulance! You're warm, though! Fire engine! Not that either. Ambulance! His two-year-old brain has gone full-circle! Police car! At this age, it takes a little time for your brain's circuits to all link up! He knows his beloved bus. But only when it goes by... Bus. The circuits have linked up. Since we've been watching little Hiroki, he's walked a long distance. And he's headed straight on without a single tear. This errand actually requires a one-kilometer journey each way! That distance is a new record for a solo errand at two years and nine months! Yes, his mother's job for him is to get some sweet curry and Boten-brand Satsuma-age fish cakes. She also asked for some flowers to offer at Grandma's altar, but will he remember all three? He arrives at the supermarket one kilometer away after 23 minutes. That's an average speed of 2.6 kilometers per hour. Good going! The doors have opened, but the circuits haven't linked up yet. Oh! That was a fast response. "What am I here for again?" His head is rattling like a capsule toy! All right! Circuits linked! You were sent to do the shopping! He's running! The squeaking of his shoes gets louder and then quieter again. Huh? This doesn't look like curry. Oh! One pack of Boten, in the bag! Curry next? Better ask the store clerk for a sweet one. Where are the flowers? Remarkable! - - - Where are the flowers? - Flowers? - - - He talked! - They're over here. Follow me. Apparently, he always freshens up the water for the altar! He's getting chrysanthemums for Grandma. And he's just remembered you're supposed to get a basket when you arrive. Not that he has so much that he needs a basket, anyway... - - - Do you want a basket? - I can't pick it up. But this two-year-old wants to do things the usual way. In here? - - - Is that everything? - Yes. He hasn't got the curry yet. Yeah. - Okay? - Yeah. That will be 587 yen, sir. He's completely forgotten about the sweet curry. He produces a 1000-yen bill... 1000 yen. Okay. 413 yen change. Shall I just put it in? - - - I'll put it in. - You will? Okay. He puts the receipt and change in his bag himself! Okay. Okay. Thank you very much. Please come again. Superb! I underestimated you! He forgot the curry, but this is more than enough! It's a long way home too! One whole kilometer! Hang in there! I need to go again. The curry. I forgot the curry. The circuits have just connected! He makes a beeline for the curry mountain! He knows where he's going! Huh? He went past it. What's going on? It's over here! I guess he doesn't know where he's going, after all. Or so I thought, but then he slides into the shot! There are lots of different types, though. That's it! Sweet flavor. He was taught to find the sweet flavor by looking for the round mark that's red like Anpanman's nose! SWEET With everything checked off, time for the one-kilometer journey back! Oh, dear! Those flowers are a bit on the long side. They might poke out. Oh, something is poking out of his nose too! Now, time to cross a big road. This is where the flag Mom made comes in. STOP It sure does the trick! Just like magic, the cars all stopped. That's the power of Mom's love. - - - Mommy! - Okay! I got it all! Wow! Great job! Flowers! Thanks to the cellophane, the flowers are in one piece. What do you have for me? - - - First, he gives her the receipt. - Okay. He's got it more together than any grown-up! - - - We'll show this to Daddy. - Yeah. - Hiroki, attention. - Stand up. Two years and nine months old, and 86 centimeters tall. This tall! Today, they offer the flowers to Grandma without cutting them. In it goes! In the sweet curry goes sweet Kagoshima Satsuma-age! This is just as Grandma made it, so Dad also grew up eating this curry! - - - Ready? Thank you for this meal! - Thank you for this meal! Dad's wolfing it down! Yummy! Isn't it yummy, Hiroki? I know! Go and buy curry when Dad's in a bad mood! Subtitle translation by: Lewis Williams
