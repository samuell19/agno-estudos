Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. SIGN OF THE GLADIATOR -Who are you? -A legionary of the Emperor. -What do you want? -I have a plea. You must avenge all those who tell in Syria because of Quenn Zenobia's treason. Quenn Zenobia, who rose to the throne of Syria following the death of King Odenathus. her spouse and our most loyal ally. began showing signs of intolerance towards Rome. With the help of the Assyrians she served the sacred bonds which tied her to the Empire. Our garrisons were taken by surprise and annihilated. Their banners dragged along the desert sand. That woman's crazed ambition must be suppressed. Perhaps we should entrust the fate of that far province to negotiations rather than to military force. Negotiations would serve no purpose. Zenobia rebelled when she realised our troops wouldn't be moved from the northern borders. Revolt is rife in Gaul and Germany. Withdrawing one single legion could spell disaster. What about the disasters which could be caused by that arrogant queen? We've confronted that arrogance with the bravery of one of our best generals. Marcus Valerius. Marcus Valerius is a man, not a god. No matter how courageous, his cohorts are insufficient to hold back those hordes. Marcus Valerius, commander of the Roman troops. He's here at your feet, alive as you wished. On your knees. Kneel before our Queen, you Roman dog. Don't Romans kneel? Not before a queen guilty of treason. The treaty with Rome was oppressive for my people. Isn't someone who refuses to sbmit to Rome a traitor? And what is someone refusing to kneel before Zenobia? -An enemy. -Conquered enemies should die. -Kill me. -Dying is too easy. Slavery is more offensive to a Roman's pride. You developed your muscles in Rome's gymnasia. I'll send you to a place whe yo can exercise them. Work, you scum! Come on, move. Hold it. If you kill him, you'll take his place. Go on, keep working or I'll break your bones. Stand back. Pull back the stone. Help me get him out. All back to work. Hurry. -What's going on? -His arm is crushed. -He'll bleed to death. -Don't waste your time. He's useless for work, anyway. I'll finish him off. Don't move or I'll kill him. Look after him. Take him outside. Even with one arm he'll be good for something. Thank you. He was one of my soldiers. In battle you'd be too scared to look at him. Now you can take your anger out on me. Get him. I could slay you like a dog. But that would be too little for what you've just done. Tie him to the cross. In the sun! You'll die of thirst. Your skin will parch. Your blood will dry up while you await death. But that will be slow to come. Take him away. Go. Hey, you! Forbid our men to enter any taverns. or to approach women. Our lives are at stake. One word and we're lost. May I be damned if that isn't our ally. It is she! It would be child's play to kill her now. But it would cost you your life. One step towards her and you're dead. Who will give us the information we need? Someone I'm meeting tonight. Stand back. Back. Go away. -Is that the Roman consul? -Yes, my Queen. What's his crime? Attempting to start a mutiny. Bring him here. That man does not deserve your sympathy. In your place I would not be so lenient. I didn't ask for your advice, Semantius. What makes you think I'm so merciful? Quickly. So this is a symbol of the Roman Empire. He could be knocked over with a single blow. I was told you dared to revolt against my men. It doesn't surprise me that such inhuman tortures were ordered by you. Your cruelty is well known. You're talking to the Queen of Palmyra. A traitor to the Empire. You're too insolent. True. But wait for her order before you kill me. It's useless to attempt to provoke me. I won't give you the gift of death. You must live, Consul Valerius. That is your punishment. You'll live to witness the end of Rome. You'll live to see its Empire crumble. I thank you, Queen. You're wishing me a long life. It would take longer than both our lifetimes. You're wrong, Consul. The flight of Rome's eagles is over. Then your skies will be crowded with vultures. A sad change, indeed. Many corpses are needed to satisfy them. Tie him to the cross again. Batsheba... I thought I'd never see you again. The gods protected me. My dear.... I'm so happy. But how could you be so careless? There's a reward for any Roman captured in town. I had to see you. I would give my life for your safety. Do not fear. I know how to defend myself. Do you have any news of Consul Valerius? Have they killed him? Worse. He's a slave at the mills. I must save him. I have resolute men with me. If they catch you, they'll show no mercy. Can any of the guards be trusted? Perhaps one. His name is Lator. He's a strong man who pretends to be cruel. He believes in a strange god. He's loyal to me. He'll help you. How will he recognise me? Give this to him and say the words "For the love of God". He says that all the time. Why are you sad? Once Valerius is freed I'll lose you. I'll be back, Bathseba. Together with the Roman legions. Zenobia will pay for her treason. As will your brother's assassins. Poor Odenathus. I hope you don't think the Romans killed him. I'm sure they didn't. Why would they? Odenathus was loyal to Rome. His assassins are right here in Palmyra. Bathsheba... It's dawn. -I must go. -Yes, or you'll be found out. I'll be back soon. Then you'll no longer be the vestal virgin. You'll simply be Bathsheba, the spouse of Julian. You! Are you asleep? -Are you relieving me? -Yes. I'll do better than you. I'll keep my eyes wide open. Fire...Fire! Come on, hurry. Come on, move. This way. Bring water! Valerius, at last. Quickly, let's go. Thank you, Lator. Flavius... Go up there and keep guard. I'll take care of this. You, at least, didn't forget me. It is Rome which does not forget its favourite sons. A conquered son. In Rome, the Senate and the Emperor know that you were overwhelmed by a far larger army. They also know it was an honourable defeat. Our friendship makes you forget reality. In Rome I will face demotion. Worry not. Marcius Valerius. Rome needs you. Julian... I have an idea. A brillant idea. What idea? I'll go back to Palmyra. Has slavery driven you crazy? No. I must return to Palmyra at all costs. For what purpose? Our revenge. But how can we achieve it? I have a plan which could turn the situation in our favour. What happened last night is unforgivable. I can't trust anyone any more. If it isn't treason it's gross negligence. It's incredible. Despite guards everywhere a slave in chains managed to escape. Had we killed him as I suggested... I alredady told you a Roman doesn't see death as punishment. Marcus Valerius is too dangerous to be free. We can't just sit back and wait. Don't worry. Marcus Valerius will not remain free for long. And remember... I want him alive. Don't give her words too much importance. That Roman dog! How could he? Don't worry about it. Your men will recapture him. An envoy of King Shapur has arrived from Persia. -Where is he? -In my quarters. Do not fear. I'm not going to kill you. You! Here. It's my only weapon. How did you get in here? That doesn't matter. Just listen to me. You'll pay dearly for your audacity. -I will play fair. -What do you want? I want to be your ally. You! Those who helped me escape would have dragged me to Rome. Rome doesn't forgive those who fail. All this sounds amusing. It's not hard to choose between an inglorious death and a new life. I'm ready to place my sword at your service. The sword of a traitor. I've shed my blood for Rome on many a battlefield. If i go back I'll receive the most atrocious insult. that a soldier could expect. Do you think I'm so naive as to believe you? I can help you accomplish your dreams of power. -You're a dangerous nemey. -Listen to me, Zenobia. It's a priceless gift. Worthy of such a powerful king. Extend my thanks to your magnificent lord. Tell him I confirm our agreement. King Shapur himself will lead his army. Victory won't escape him. Give him a singal and he'll attack Palmyra. No, we must be cautious. What will Rome do after the defeat? If it sent its troops now stationed in Gaul the Persian army could be overcome. Go and reassure King Shapur. We'be both decided to make Persia. the most powerful kingdom in the East. You'll be the most powerful man at King Shapur's court. That's what I want. Promise you'll always keep me at your side. How could you doubt it, Erika? Provided what you're saying is true. of what use could you be to me? I'm an expert in modern military art. My people don't need you. Their enthusiasm is enough. Enthusiasm can be easily dampened. I can train your hordes to be great legions. Under my guidance they could set out to conquer the world. Empty words! Rome will send a powerful army against you. Your forces will be exhausted and unable to cope. They must be subjected to strict discipline. and trained in effective combat methods. Rome's defeat will double its thirst for revenge. Your plans of expansion will drown in blood. How can I believe you? What proof of loyalty can you give me? As much proof as you wish. How about this one? In the oasis of Jatabu... -Does it make any sense? -No, it's beyond me. We're supposed to surrender without a fight... When will it be, anyway? We've been sizzling here for two days. Make sure you lay down your arms and surrender. -Who are you? -A Roman tired of fighting. Who's at the oasis? Fifteen men. Tne only survivors of my legion. -Armed? -No. How did you know we were coming? I spotted you from that hill. We know the Queen has sent patrols into the desert to finish off what's left of the Roman legion. Twice we managed to avoid them. But we've had enough. We're exhausted. We can't hold out without food or water. We surrender. If this a trick, you'll be the first to pay. Follow me. Itus should be back by now. If you have lied, you'll be fed to the sacred tigers. The tigers will wait in vain. Are you disappointed? Here he is. So? -My Queen... -What news do you bring? We captured them. The'll be in the dungeons in less than an hour. I've preceded them to give you the news. -Are you sure it was them? -Yes. Any losses? None. It was all so simple. They surrendered without any resistance. I hope this is proof of my loyalty. I think the Queen will demand a more convincing proof. Such as? Killing the prisoners. I've always considered myself a soldier. But if the Queen wants to turn me into an assassin I'm ready to carry out her orders. I want the order to come from you, Zenobia. My minister decides the fate of our prisoners. Did you hear that? The decision is up to me. Here. With this you'll do a good job. Go. I don't need you. -Water... -Quiet! This should be them. What happened? We were attacked by rebels. They overpowered us and got away. What are you saying? Speak clearly. Go on, talk! We were a mile from Palmyra. We were ambushed while crossing a forest. We didn't have the time to organise a defence. Almost everyone was killed. Then try freed the prisoners. Who were they? Desert men. We tried... No excuses. Who was leading them? Lator, the chief guard of the slaves. Take care of this coward. Do you know what this means? That there are traitors in your ranks. My suspicions have been proved. Take your dagger back. I'm an expert on weapons. This is a Persian dagger. With such a handle you can't go wrong. Yes, it's Persian. So what? Nothing. My father was a Persian. -Are you insinuating something? -What are you saying? If we are to co-operate for the future glory of the Kingdom of Palmyra we must get to know each other thoroughly. Let the High Priest speak. Let the vestal virgin be punished. Don't you think, Roman, that Bathsheba helped the prisoners escape? What do you think? That Lator followed her orders. He's very loyal to her. Perhaps. What makes you think so? A strange coincidence. The sacred flame was put out and Bathsheba disappeared the very night of the prisoners' outbreak. Semantius certainly has a quick mind. The perennial flame which burned in the temple. and was entrusted to the virgin Bathsheba. guarded the spirit of love of our goddess. The vestal virgin has fled. But the fire will burn again in honour of the goddess. A major sacrifice is called for. The virgin's blood will cleanse the profaned altar. -Anything suspicious? -Nothing. -Where's Simon? -Grazing his flock. He's a good man. He follows the Master's word. -How is Bathsheba? -Well. But she misses you. -Bathsheba.... -Julian! Only with you beside me do I feel safe. What will happen to us? The odds are against us. We're together now. Let's try to be happy. Death could be lurking behind this happiness. Death is not what we should feel around us. But hope, rather. Your heart is pure. The gods will protect you. Drink this, Julian. Thank you. The sand of the desert dries your throat. Let me have some more. What help do you expect from your God if He let His prophet die on on the cross? Doesn't Bathsheba's grief make her more dear to you? Isn't her suffering proof of her love? Likewise. Christ's sacrifice proves to us the value of His merciful words. I've sighted Roman troops marching west in the valley. At last. May good fortune be with you. You're my good fortune. Look after her, Lator. Stop. Who are you? Roman soldiers. We must talk to Consul Marcellus. Go through. Keep going. Stop there. Aren't you Decurion Julian? I've fought many a battle alongside you, Marcellus. -How are things? -Optimism prevails in Palmyra. Even at the palace? Zenobia is convinced that Rome is panicking. And she's acting accordingly. Rome might not be panicking. But it is concerned. In a few days I'll have two legions available. It's the most Rome could allocate to me. A third of Zenobia's troops. But Zenobia doesn't have weapons like ours. -The catapults? -And I have other surprises. However. Rome relies heavily on Marcus Valerius. I must see him as soon as possible. I'll contact him. The Queen awaits you. I'm going. All that shouting annoys me. Consul Mrcus Valerius is outside. Call Semantius at once. You seem at ease in that attire. Because it's similar to what I'm used to wearing. To me, slave's rags are the exception. Perhaps. I'll be more useful like this than if I were in chains. I hope captivity didn't quell your fighting spirit. Are you wishing me safety? No, it's a promise. Even my army has ranks worthy of a Roman consul. Then I'll achieve those ranks. Did you send for me? I have news for you. Come forward. What's all the noise outside? Speak up. Batsheba's escape, the sacred flame's extinction and the poor harvest could forebode famine. So the people raided the supply carts. I thought I had sufficient reserves. But they are needed for war in case of a strong counter-attack by Rome. You haven't yet established new bonds with Persia. The bonds with Persia would be as onerous as those with Rome. I'm fighting a difficult battle. Rome was a burden as an ally and is even more so as an enemy. I'm relying on you, Valerius. At your orders. Before betraying us Lator spoke in secret about a Jew who multiplied bread and fishes. I wonder whether you can do likewise. As for the bread and the fishes, I don't know. But I will succeed in multiplying our troops. That's all we need. My people want indepedence but they're not prepared to make any sacrifices. The harvest was poor and I have a war think about. I'll promise a reward for the capture of the virgin. Her sacrifice will placate the people. This food is a sign of the elegance of my court. You're generous to your guests. My cooks' talents are unsurpassed. They can create most delicious dishes. There's nothing they can't do. Do you think they could turn... a Roman into a Syrian? I wish you weren't a Roman. I wish I could touch the moon by stretching an arm. You're the only man I know who has a taste for life. Maybe because I've come so close to death. I'm so fond of life. It's your right to enjoy it. You're young, beautiful, powerful.... And lonely. Men would be happy to fall at your feet. Of course. But being able to choose... is nothing compared to being chosen. I wish I'd never been your enemy. That Roman is a poisonous snake. Don't worry, Erika. I'll crush him. What are you waiting for? For him to conquer power in addition to her heart? She's lost her head over him. Let her satisfy this whim. One day, upon waking up beside Valerius she'll find Persian soldiers surrounding her love-nest. Take the road that leads to the river. Here is the situation. The Queen has set up an army to confront the Romans. There will be a battle in the desert. The Palmyrians will win it but will be so exhausted that they will not stand a second onslaught. That's when King Shapur will attack Palmyra. You generals will have an easy task. What if the Romans are not defeated? -We'd be facing two armies. -Impossible. With my plan they'll be attacked from all sides. -The'll have no way out. -I see. All the waterholes have been filled in. To survive the desert the Roman legions will have to march non stop towards the river. They'll get there exhausted and find our troops waiting for them. You'll score a memorable victory in the history of Palmyra. What's your opinion Marcus Valerius? Marcus Valerius is no longer an enemy. So? A very clever plan but for one flaw. It's too simple. You've anticipated everything. Even your opponents' naivety. I overlooked the ingenuity of Roman leaders. However, we've defeated them before. Semantius! He's right, Zenobia. Indeed I was defeated but I only had six cohorts. This time it's diffrent. You'll have no room in which to maoeuvre. That will be an advantage for the Romans. Your plan poses too many risks, Semantius. So it would seem. And that's exactly, what I rely on. The Roman consul will have the same impression and will take victory for granted. But he'll be confronted by only part of our army. The bulk of the troops will be hiding... Here, behind the Jaffa Gorge. And once the Romans are engaged in battle our cavalry will surprise them from behind. It'll be a massacre. And this time no one will be spared. Do you still find my plan naive, Valerius? I see you've learnt a lot by fighting the Romans. Only a miracle can deprive your troops of victory. You mean "our" troops. You'll be in charge of the Royal Guard. We'll fight side by side. -What do you want? -We've found you, at last! Lator! Is the sun in Rome as strong? Rome's climate is like an eternal spring. -Would you like to return? -No? Rome is dominated by lust and intrigue. But i would go back to my villa in the hills where the pinetrees reflect into a clear lake. The desert also has its charm. Sometimes my days seem empty and meaningless. Only my love for Palmyra make me feel alive. I know that Rome is strong and civilised. I rebeled only because my land was languishing. Humbled and subded. Can you understand that? Yes, Zenobia. I can understand. My aim is my people's well-being. Not only of those living in towns and villages. But of all the desert tribes who live in extreme poverty. Will you help me to fulfil my dreams? -Of course. -Don't abandon me, Valerius. How can I reassure you? What is it, Zenobia? At sunset the dunes look like gold. In this place, time is a word without meaning. The ruins of ancient cities crumble into dust. Piece by piece. -Whose tombs are these? -The ancient kings of Palmyra. They also loved life and the sun. But their passions also subsided in a tomb. By thinking more about death they'd have enjoyed life better. Had they enjoyed life too much we'd have no relics of their glory. And now Palmyra would not be striving for a better future. Didn't you say everything eventually turns into dust? The power of kingdoms and the pride of kings. True, Valerius. I'll turn into dust but my remains will be sacred. Provided my country is great. A queen's loneliness does not affect her people's fate. What's that? A desert nightingale. Its sound always foretells a happy event. What happy event? Happiness for the one who hears it. Look. Even the desert grows pretty flowers. It's said they contain the spirit of loved woman. Is there a queen among such women? Perhaps? In that one. It's the prettiest. Let me try. Here. A flower for the Queen. No, a flower for the woman. Be not afraid. I was their target. A Roman arrow... -A memento of this day. -Let's go. It's not safe here. -Greetings, Lator. -Greeting, Marcus Valerius. -Consul Valerius... -Greetings, Julian. A clever way to announce the arrival of Marcellus. He's over there. -Greetings, my friend. -Greetings, Marcellus. Your Palmyrian attire would draw a few laughs in Rome. Not to mention your oriental perfume. Perfect weapons for a love campaign. -Has the Queen surrended? -There is no time to joke. How many troops do you have? Despite my attire. I remain a Roman soldier. I never doubted that. I'm asking you to lead my two legions. Thank you, Marcellus. Two legions... Palmyra can rely on twice as many. I know. But our courage and discipline will make up for that. We have select troops ready to face any hardship. Even thirst, I hope. I was forced to reduce all water rations. Those bastards filled in all the waterholes. But not even that will be enough to prevent us reaching the river. Where the enemy will be waiting for you. The sight of water will spur on our legions. They'll overcome any obstacle. That's what Plamyra's generals rely on. While your troops are engaged by the river the bulk of their army will attack you from behind. -That's their plan. -Are you sure? Yes. Their tents are set up by the river now. As I expected. They'll fall straight into our trap. I'll owe my victory to this precious information. I'm happy to have done it for Rome. This will partly soothe my conscience. Your conscience? What do you mean? This information was given to me by the woman I love. That's right, Marcellus. I love Zenobia. Why did I survive my defeat? You see, Valerius... We soldiers are fully devoted to our duty. We must be ready to sacrifice all that belongs to us. Perhaps Rome could have victory without a bloodbath. What do you mean? Marcellus... I think... I'm sure I can convince Zenobia to give up her absurd dreams of power. She's an impetuous woman but I can convice her to come to an agreement. -It'll tale too long. -Just give me time. Our legions are running out of water. I can no longer wait. Tommorow I'll attack. I understand, Marcellus. It's you duty. This victory will be yours. You've paid a high price for it. Too high, in fact. -Farewell, Marcellus. -See you soon. I must talk to you about Batsheba. She's being held captive in the dungeons of the temple. We love each other. You must free her from the High Priest. I'll do my best. For the love of God save Batsheba's life. What is the matter, Valerius? Nothing. Tonight's heat is making me nervous and impatient. Tell me what is wrong. I'm worried. The imminent battle... Semantius' plan is not as safe as I thought.... -What are you saying? -You needn't be alarmed. Everything will work out perfectly. It's only shadows drifting across my mind. Your smile is enough to drive them away. Stay here with me. Dawn is still far away. A queen shouldn't distract her generals on the eve of a battle. But the Queen loves you. I love you too. You're so beautiful. You look worried. I can detect... Don't turn away from me. Look at me. What's bothering you? Shadows, just shadows. I'll go for a walk through the camp. I want to make sure everything's in order. As for you rest and don't worry. Hear that? The sentries are changing over. I should be there. I'll reach Palmyra before dawn. I'll try to win over the few elders who still hesistate to support me. Otherwise. I'll have to adopt other strategies. You know, my lord, how deadly my sword is. That's why you must stay here. -That Roman dog... -Exactly. -That's your task. -And a pleasant one, indeed. Valerius is the only threat to my plans. Once we get rid of him. irrespective of the outcome of the battle, Persia will draw the greatest benefits. King Shapur is powerful. His army is ready. Upon my signal, he'll occupy Palmyra. He'll find the city totally undefended. His triumph will also be mine. Make sure you remember your most faithful servant. Carry out the mission I've entrusted you with and you'll experience my generosity. The Roman will not live to see tomorrow. Now go. Not a word. -What does this mean? -Here's one of your subjects. You'd better listen to him. Confess what Semantius is scheming against her. Have mercy on me. Speak. I'll confess. But I was only obeying orders. Go on. We know that. King Shapur is ready to attack. His armies are drawn up by the river. They're waiting for Semantius' order to attack once your troops are exhausted. Semantius... A traitor... And that's not all. There's something else you should know. Who killed King Odenathus? The arrow was Roman but it was you who shot it. Obeying Semantius' orders. Have mercy... I only obeyed orders. Have mercy. Aren't you going to kill him? Guards! Take this wretch away. He must die before dawn. I always suspected Semantius was betraying you. Have Semantius arrested. On many occasions King Shapur of Persia has sent diplomatic envoys to try to re-establish the old bonds of friendship. But Zenobia has always rejected them. King Shapur hates the Romans as much as we do. And has a formidable army. Only he and his army can save our country. provided they get here on time. We can't allow that! We must decide now. Before two days are over the Romans can arrive at our undefended walls. Surely the Queen cannot betray her own people. Why should I wish to deceive you? I've always served my country faithfully. Let those who think my advice is honest raise their hands. As for those who think otherwise... may the gods forgive their blindness. Noble friends... I never doubted your wisdom. But before my departure... in order to ensure Palmyra's ultimate security I wish to submit to your enlightened judgment another grave issue. I'm referring to Batsheba. The sacrilegious virgin. The virgin whose sacrilege has drawn upon us the anger of the goddess. Marcus Valerius has convinced Zenobia to spare her. But until Bathsheba pays for her crime the spectre of a disastrous defeat will drift with its terrible omen over our country. Semantius is right. Death to Bathsheba. So, Nazirk? Consul Marcus Valerius has left camp. Gather all the commanders and lift camp. It will soon be dawn. I want to take the Romans by surprise. Julian... Batshsheba... Come away. Queen, you are conquered. Wait. It would have been fatal to anyone else. He's a man of exceptional strength. -He's in a lot of pain. -Just fever. The worst is over. -Can he travel? -If it's really necessary. Forgive me, Zenobia. I have to disturb you. Why apologise? You're in charge here now. I'm only a prisoner. What rights do I have left? The respect due to a woman. But I have serious reasons for disturbing your isolation. I've received the order to take you to Rome. We leave tommorow at dawn. There I'll be the subject of your triumph. It's a harsh custom. But Rome demands it. However. I'll accept the triumph only if I can share it with the man who deserves the credit for our victory. Consul Marcus Valerius. How can your people honour a traitor? It saddens me to hear you call Marcus Valerius a traitor. From the outset he tried to convice me to negotiate peace with you. He did it because he loved you. When he uncovered Semantius' plot he left the camp only to save you. Upon to the last moment he tried to spare you the horror of a fatal defeat. I was the one who forced him to give up his generous plan. We didn't want this war. Under King Odenathus' rule Palmyra enjoyed many years of peace and prosperity. After the death of our ally Palmyra plunged into violence and poverty. But Rome does not renege on its old alliances. I entrust you, Bathsheba. with pursuing the policies of your wise brother. Go and guide your people towards prosperity. with the blessing of Rome. I know that Palmyra's fate is linked to that of Rome. But let my reign begin under the auspices of your leniency. I've come before you Aurelian, and the Roman Senate to speak in favour of Zenobia. What do you mean? Zenobia would never have rebelled if it weren't for her treacherous minister. And it was I who uncovered Semantius. a puppet of the King of Persia. I, a Roman Consul. In exchange for the services I have rendered to Rome I ask you to spare Zenobia's life. If this conquered queen deserves your clemency deliver your verdict accordingly. Let her live. Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
