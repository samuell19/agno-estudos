I'm sorry, sir. Darn it! It wasn't meant for you. It was for the math teacher. I would never have done this to you because I like you very much. Keep your appreciation to yourself, Miss Santangelo. I will. You don't deserve it. Watch your manners, you brat. Brat to me? Who do you think you are? And to think that I... Too bad for you. I'll take revenge. I'll torment you like a mosquito. Darn mosquitoes! You'll pay for it this time. I'll be like a mosquito. You'll pay for it this time. I'll be like a mosquito. A mosquito. A mosquito. A mosquito. A mosquito. A mosquito! I will torment you and you'll see. You are stuck up and make me so angry. I won't let you live in peace. I don't care about you anymore because you're not nice to me. It's over between us. I'm upset with you now. You'll pay for it this time. I'll be like a mosquito. You'll pay for it this time. I'll be like a mosquito. You are stuck up and make me so angry. I won't let you live in peace. A mosquito that flies close to your face the whole night. I am very upset with you now. I am very upset with you now. I am very upset with you now. Darn mosquitos! Luigina, Luigina! You said yes when you were 15. - Uncle Carmelo, he's not there! - Get me the cookies. - Who isn't there? - Mr. Paolo isn't in his room. He didn't go to bed. The bed is untouched. - He's not there? - He went with women last night. If Mrs. Luigina knows, she'll get frightened. I hope nothing happened. My gosh! - What is it? - The cat went by. It's just a kitten! Are you superstitious? Do you believe in bad luck? - An intelligent man like you! - I don't believe in superstition. - This is stuff for ignorant people. - Yes, for ignorant people. Get that polka dot cup up there. Do you think I'm stupid? The cat went by here, and I should go? You said it was stuff for ignorant people. Me? You said that. Will you get the cup or not? I won't walk past here if the cat did. I've so much to do! I can't stay here like an idiot. No. The solution is for someone else to walk past there. - Personnel! - Here she is! Service? Did Mr. Paolo already have breakfast? I don't understand. Come here. - I can't. - Why not? My foot hurts. A small accident. - Is my nephew ready or not? - Yeah... Sure! - What does he mean? - He always kids around. - I'll go personally. - Don't walk past there! - Why not? - Stop! Don't walk past there! Miss... Your nephew Paolo isn't in his room. - He may have already gotten up. - He didn't go to bed. What? - It brings bad luck. - I must... A cat went by. Do something. Get the anti-thing on the thing... - What thing? - Stop! The horn! It's hanging near the calendar. - Come on... - One moment! - Here it is. - Excuse me. Give it to me! He's being funny! There. Wait a moment. Garlic and plaice, bad luck will not take place. Ace takes everything and dies in the body of the devil. Carmelo. - You can walk past. - How silly! When a cat walks past... - How ridiculous! - No, Uncle, no! He's not in his room. It's absurd! - Here he is! - He's here! You said he wasn't here. Paolo! He said he wasn't here. He was here! I didn't tell you to avoid upsetting you. - He wasn't there earlier! - We'll deal it with you later. Paolo, get up! The dance lesson is over. They're waiting for you for rehearsal. - Stop it! - A hair. - You must set a good example. - Keep it. - Miss... - Don't interrupt me! If the bell rings and you're not in the music room, I'll send you back to your grandma at San Benedetto del Tronto. - Not to Grandma's! - Oh, yes. I didn't know. I swear on the souls of my 14 uncles and aunts! I'll talk to you later! Darn. It's closed! Where is the key? This is a joke the girls played. Where's the key? Darn them! Here it is! In the ink. In the red ink. Very funny. Very funny! They sewed my socks. What angels! This is not a boarding school. This is... A mental institution! Those idiots! The key. I'm coming! They even sewed the sleeves! Who could the idiot be? Young ladies, ready? One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. We'll do a pique now. Remember your arms, and then your head. Torregiani, be careful. Head facing forward. One and two. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. Eight. One, two, three, four. Arms behind you now. And one, two, three, four, five... Excuse us, maestro. Get dressed, girls. Thank you for giving me a bit of your time today. I'm fine. I never felt so well. - "Va pen"? - What? "Va pen"! Miss Santangelo, the fact that you have a decent voice doesn't authorize you to think that I enjoy these stupid jokes. Now the chorus. "Va pensiero". "Va pen" means "Va pensiero". One, two... Go thought on golden wings. Go settle on slopes and hills where fragrant warm and soft are the breezes of our sweet native land. Beethoven fell asleep. He looks like an angel. - An angel? He's snoring! - Let's wake him up with a bang. If he wakes up, we'll have to do the lesson. We'll let him sleep. Let's go. - What do you want? - Nothing. Is it a secret? - It's my business. - How exaggerated! - What did she want? - Nothing. I had The Mosquito. - Did she see it? - No. I don't trust Bonfanti. Since she's been here, strange things happen. - She is a spy. - Rita! Where did Beethoven go last night? We should find out. We should find a way to figure out where he spends his night. Yes! Yes. What should we do? We have to look in that trunk that Beethoven always keeps locked. The Maria Adelaide boarding school has its traditions. - Luigiona! - The head mistress! Hurry up! Shouldn't there be a singing lesson? We don't even hear a whisper. Let's go see. Maestro. - What is he doing? Sleeping? - What? Go thought on golden wings... Ladies, silence! - Mr. Paolo, what's going on? - It's that... Pull yourself together. I don't know. There is... There's something that... Excuse me. Will you give me an explanation on what is going on? It's as if... I am not able... I don't know what happened. It's a stupid joke. - It's glued. - I don't know how it... Because... - I can't... - Who did it? Ladies, you better confess. Nobody is speaking. Too bad for you! - Hold still. Don't jump around. - I'm sorry, Auntie. By myself I can't... Help me unglue the teacher. - Let's unglue him. - Thank you. - Pull. - Come. Help, please! You are all responsible for this sabotage! I could've broken my fibula! - Raise up your head mistress! - Auntie! No recreation for a week. And no more bicycle rides, either. What? That's a sports exercise. No recreation for one week. Right! Ladies! If your love leaves you, don't cry because he'll come back here. He'll surely come back here. If he says goodbye and leaves, don't cry because he'll come back here. He'll surely come back here. Because you know that he can't live without you. He can't live by himself anymore. If he laughs about all this, don't cry because he'll come back here. He'll surely come back here. You'll have to suffer a bit inside. But one day you'll see that he'll come back to you. If he says goodbye and leaves, don't cry because he'll come back here. He'll surely come back here. Because you know that he can't live without you. He can't live by himself anymore. And if he'll laugh about all this, don't cry because he'll come back here. He'll surely come back here. He'll come back here. He'll surely come back here. He'll come back here. He'll surely come back here. Countess Maria Adelaide would turn over in her grave. Look. This paper is called "The Mosquito". It's a clear instigation to indiscipline. There are suggestions on how to seduce men! It's shameful, look. Let me read before judging. It seems impossible that the girls wrote such a paper. - Are there things that are really... - Not exactly, but... It's something very serious. Paolo! Paolo! Doesn't it seem serious to you too? - If I may, I'd go... - You stay here. This paper has to do with you personally too. "The music teacher, sitting or lying, is always asleep." How bad-mannered! I have a nervous breakdown. I'm sick. There is some truth in it. You should talk to a doctor. Your sleepiness is not natural. - Anyway, this doesn't justify it. - Absolutely not. You laugh, and I know the reason. I was nicknamed Catherine Spaak. But in your place, I wouldn't laugh too much. You have a nice nickname too. Buxom Luigiona. Buxom Luigiona? I am this Buxom Luigiona? He who laughs last laughs best. We'll do an investigation and find out who the authors of these papers are. - What does it say on seduction? - It explains how to seduce a man. Catherine Spaak is interested. She must seduce many men! You don't want the details, do you? It's an invitation to shame. - What is it? - I'll get it. - It could be a cat. - I'll look. Hold me tight. Poor thing! Slowly. Are you laughing? How did they find "The Mosquito"? I think it was Bonfanti. They're having a council meeting. Good! We'll have the time to look in the trunk. Marisa, you stay here. Lili, come with me. It doesn't open. In the chemistry room there's dynamite. The teacher's council will last an hour. We'll have it explode. No. They'd hear it. Give me a hairpin. - A hairpin? - Yes, and check that nobody arrives. Usually, with a hairpin I do incredible things. - I opened it. Come! - You made it. - How magnificent! - Look. A wig? Does he have a bald girlfriend? Bald and with a big head. It's huge! - This is a yé-yé song! - Yé-yé? Something is up. I'll follow him tonight. - He'll recognize you. - I'll dress up like a boy. - And these? - This was little Beethoven. Aunt Luigia with her boyfriend, Peppino. - The head mistress was engaged! - Buxom Luigiona! It's marvelous! - Marisa is calling. Go see what for. - I'll run. And you? Who are you? You're a singer. Lucky you! "To my adored teddy bear. Lida." Beethoven, a teddy bear? Beethoven, what a sassy expression! Who do you think you are? You are no one. You are so unpleasant! You are so unpleasant! But I don't know why I can't think of anything else but you. You are so unpleasant! You are so unpleasant! So why is it that when I talk, I only talk about you? I don't like you. You never make fun. I don't like the way you treat me. But all I think about is you. I've fallen in love with you. You are so unpleasant! You are so unpleasant! And yet I don't know why I can't think of anything else but you. You are so unpleasant! Why did I have to fall in love with you? I don't like the way you treat me. I don't like you. You never make fun. I don't like the way you treat me. Help! Help! What do you want? Help! They're killing me! They're turning me around. Who is it? I don't have money. Let me go! I'm innocent! Help! What do you want from me? Help! Mom! Help! Did you understand that I don't have money? Help! - Shut up! - Help! My head is spinning! I have a delicate head! What do you want? Take your clothes off. - Take your clothes off! - Is this about sex? - Sex? Idiot! - Are you women? I'm in! - Take off the sack. I'm in! - Stop! Take off your clothes inside the sack. You want a strip the Hamburg widow? Alright. I'm the widow... Come here. Give me your jacket! Your shirt! Your shirt I said! Shirt. - Shoes. - One... and two. - Pants. - My pants? - This is interesting! - Be quick! - Come on. - What about the socks? - Socks. - Here they are. - The undershirt and underwear? - You can keep them. - Watch him. - What should I do now? - It's cold! - Get inside! Where am I going? Come on! Jump inside. - Go on! - Inside. - There's water in here! It's cold! - Down! I'll get bronchitis! - Murderers! - Let's go. I recognized you. You are Santangelo! Our students wrote a paper on these topics: How to shave your legs, how to make your skin beautiful with potatoes, and how to learn a Japanese fight technique. Excuse me, Miss Luigia. You illuminate me. I am old-fashioned. This generation of females, that feels the impulse to learn how to kick males, I believe is dangerous. It's more than matriarchy! This is the prelude to the apocalypse. I don't know, but it's surely a prelude to tightening of the rules. As of today, strict supervision and surprise searches. Everyone... Everyone. Everyone! Sorry. I was reading to understand the paper's contents. I never heard of this potato thing. Look. Here there's written: "Potatoes against all wrinkles, especially facial ones." - Potatoes on the face! - I didn't know, either. Shall we subscribe to it? Be serious. The situation is very serious. Yes, hairy legs, kicks in the face... It's the apocalypse! Here. You'll look good like this. Not like this. - I'd better not! Give me the jacket. - Here. Ciccio's shoulders are like mine. It's perfect. What a tough guy! You're phenomenal. I'm cool! Look at what a handsome guy. I'm attractive. Admit it, babe. You like me. Girls like me. Look at my walk. Red-head, here comes... the falcon! What'll we do tonight? - What do you think? - You just look like Ciccio. Great! Beethoven, I won't leave you until I find everything out. - Bye. - Bye. - Hi, uncle. - Where are you going? You bad-mannered scoundrel! This is how Beethoven spends his nights! He's a wild yé-yé! And the wig was his. - Wow! He's great! - Really great! Who is the blond girl? Will you keep on flirting or shall we start playing? Ok. Come on, guys! Lida will sing a song now... It was my turn! That scum! Send her away. Lida, wait. Who is she? - Wow! - She's fantastic. She should sing my song. - I want to know who she is. - Alright. Fantastic! Awesome! Who is she? - Have you ever seen her? - No. - She's leaving. - Wait! - Yé-yé girl, stay with me. - Leave me alone! - Stay with me. - Leave me alone! I'll give you a watermelon. Please, leave me alone! - Scoundrel! - Who is it? Her sister is here! You stay too. Little girl, you lost your toupee. I'll slap you, you hoodlum! Stay with me, yé-yé girl. Don't be rude. Do you like watermelon? Have a watermelon. Yé-yé boy, leave me alone! Take your hands off me! I'm hungry. There! It's not worth anything! Here! Leave me alone! Have more watermelon. Where did the yé-yé girl go? The yé-yé girl fooled you too. I want to know where Ciccio went. I haven't seen him this morning. - What are you doing? - There are no cigarettes here. There's a mouse. I prepared a trap. There. - Uncle Carmelo! - Finally! - It's a miracle if I'm alive. - Where did you go all night? It's a miracle if I'm alive and you treat me like this? I was assaulted. They took off my clothes and beat me up. - They put me naked in a water tank. - They assaulted you! Did they steal your mother's diamonds? I don't like lies, especially idiotic ones coming from an idiot. You should have said, "Dear, sweet, beloved uncle," "wanted to spend a great night and have fun." As the song says... The night is too short for us. Much too short. But not lying, because a liar is also a thief. You never believe me. I won't tell you anything anymore. Here's the thief! - Thief! - No, Uncle Carmelo! There. So you won't steal cigarettes from my pocket anymore. You would be capable of cutting off a finger for a cigarette. - What an uncle! - What an uncle... Enough stealing and lying. I'll prepare one again. Smoking is a bad habit. I didn't lie. I was really assaulted. He insists! I saw you. You said bye. You were cheerful and smiling. And now your face is sad and mortified. How disgusting! I swear. Don't swear. You know what happens now? I had you hired and I can have you fired. Imbecile, delinquent, scoundrel, idiot and ignorant! I'll smoke a cigarette in your face now. See? - What goes around comes around. - My God! "The Night Song of a Wandering Shepherd of Asia" by Giacomo Leopardi. Why are you there, moon, in the sky? Tell me, silent moon. You rise at night and go contemplating deserts... - Don't mime so much. Simply say it. - I'm sorry. Then you lay down. Are you not sated yet with riding eternal roads? I can't be a victim of misunderstanding and injustice. You even had me catch a cold. I'll tell the head mistress that you assaulted me. And I'll tell her that you molested me. I molested you? You're crazy! - It's not true. - I know, but she'd believe it. - Look at you. - You must help me now. - I will go out every evening. - Where? It's my business! So I'll go out in the evening! It's a risk. If Uncle Carmelo finds out, he'll talk. He's strict and he'll catch you. Then I can't help you. - I'll be kicked out. - He must become my accomplice. - What? - Can't we blackmail him? - For what? - He must have some weak points. Some mess, some petty theft. No. He's uprighteous! We'll try with "I know everything". - "I know everything"? - Yes. - What do you know? - Nothing. But if you say "I know everything" people get scared because they surely have something to hide. I'll go to Carmelo and tell him... Carmelo, I know everything. - What? - Everything. - Everything what? - You know, everything. Yes, but... Did you find out about... Yes. - How did you find out? - By chance. Don't ruin me. For twenty years I've keep this secret in my heart. My secret love that I keep inside my heart. - For 20 years? Wow! - That is so. Miss... Sorry if I touch you. She was a girl like you. I studied to become a marshal in the police. But I had an uncle who had a garden center at Castellammare and one day he said, "Take these plants to the Maria Adelaide boarding school." I said yes. I took the truck and came here. When I arrived, she appeared to me all dressed in white! She was a flower. Her face was pink, her eyes were black and her hair... She said, "Auntie is coming". "I'm Miss Luigia." As soon as she said, "My aunt is coming", I felt a tremor in my whole body. I fell in love with her immediately. I took my uniform and threw it away and came here looking for a job. They asked me what I could do. I didn't know how to do anything, but I said I could do everything so they hired me as a handyman. So I've been here 20 years with this secret in my heart. I adapt to all these jobs just for her. To be near her. You are in love with Buxom Luigiona, The head mistress! You didn't know. You shouldn't have done this. You betrayed me. Hypocrite! Please, don't ruin me. Don't worry, but tell me who he is. Don't show him to me! He's Peppino Del Grande. - Was he Luigiona's fiancé? - Yes. They were getting married. - Why didn't they? - For spite. But she still cares about him. I hate him! Don't show him to me. You saw him in a photo. - But then... - If you see him personally, he's short, fat and has a big head. There. I did it. "Luigina, my love, my great love." "Years have gone by, but you remain the queen of my heart." "What a terrible mistake it was to leave you!" "Now, after a lifetime regretting you, I have the courage, before it's too late, to write to you and tell you that I love you." "What about you? Peppino." "Luigina, my love... Peppino." - Auntie, what's wrong? - My Peppino. Oh, God! The letter! How dare you? There's no address. We must find him! - Paolino, find him and call him... - Who? At the State Education Department and look for the address of a professor, Peppino Del Grande. - Yes, but calm down. - Be quick. I'm going! My love, I'll answer immediately. Away with all these papers! My love! My love. In all these years, I have kept in my heart, my love for you. I always felt you next to me. My Peppino! There he is. That blondie dancing with him is very cute! She Looks like a Hollywood star. They're dancing cheek to cheek! She's really cute, darn it! Maybe that's the type of woman he likes. Curvy, blonde dressed in sequins. Provoking and terribly sexy! Divine. It's a shame I'm not like that. Alright. I'll try to be noticed by Beethoven. Excuse me a minute. Will you dance? Listen... Why are you like this with me? It's the second time. I look at you and I come towards you... And you run away. Why? - I must go. - No. Wait a minute. I have lots of things to tell you. How strange! I don't want to talk anymore. I just want to hold you like this. Close to me. - What's your name? - Bye. It can't end like this. What can I do to see you again? Where can I find you? Who are you? I can just say... Just... goodbye. Very softly. I'll tell you very softly my little goodbye with a whisper. So nobody will understand, and only you will understand how much in love I am with you! Very softly. I must say it very softly this little goodbye. I'm sorry I can only say goodbye, while among the people I'd like to shout out loud that I love you, very loudly! That I love you more than anything in the world. Love. I love you. That I love you more than anything in the world. Love. I love you. - Wait. - Paolo! Why does she run away like this? I just want to talk to her. - Why does she run away? - Maybe she's Cinderella. You're so stupid! I want to talk about work. She could start a career. I wonder what color her eyes are! You danced with her and don't know the color of her eyes. It was dark. She had those big glasses on! - What does Lida say? - She's so boring! She makes scenes without realizing that it's useless. She'll never be a real singer because she has no voice. Teddy bear, love... It's all over? I don't know. I'm tired of her. I can't stand her or those girls anymore. You don't know them! I can imagine. My aunt is very nice, but she has her ideas. I want to write my songs, live my life. And then... I don't know why, but... I have the impression that... That the girl is like a sign of destiny. It's absurd because I just saw her, but she's important. She came in my life just like that. And it's as if everything depends on her. - And you let he get away? - I don't know. It was dark! She runs away like a lunatic! Sometimes I think she doesn't exist, that I dreamed of her. But I know she exists. I wonder why she does that. - You have a big crush on her. - I don't know what she looks like. But you still have a crush on her. Goodbye, or we'll talk about her until tomorrow morning. Bye. Bye. Sleep! - Bye. - Bye! - What is it? - What happened? - Aunt Luigia! - What was that noise? - What did you do? - Did you hear it too? - Yes, and I got dressed right away. - But... There it is again! It's coming from the roof. I'll go see. What is going on? What's happening? My God! What's happening? Is it Carnival? These are mummies. That's the anti-aging potato. Great! First we condemn it, and then you use the potatoes. Women are always so vain. I can't stand these things, and I'm going to bed. Good night! We must not be ashamed. Women must take care of their skin. - Let's go upstairs. - Yes. - Don't worry, I'll go up. - Careful, Paolo. - It could be some delinquent. - There's nobody here. - It must be a cat. - There's no cat here. - I'll go take a look upstairs. - Be careful. I'll go look in the water tanks room. Be careful, Paolo. Is anyone here? The window is open. He ran away on the roof. - I'm calling the police. - No. Silence! It's Santangelo. She sleepwalks. It could be dangerous. I'm falling! I'm falling! Oh, God. Paolo! - I'm drowning. Help! - My gosh! - What is going on? - Mr. Paolo died. Mr. Paolo? Don't tell Miss Luigina. - Mr. Paolo crashed to the ground. - He is dead! - No, I didn't hurt myself. - He didn't hurt himself. Paolo, wait. My Paolo! Go on, pull. - Give me your hand. - Come on. - Pull me up. - Pull! Help! Someone help me! Help! Give me your hand. - Lili, hurry! - How did it go? - I was so scared. - What happened? - You can't imagine. - I heard a big commotion earlier. - What a night! - Tell me about it! It's too late now. Tomorrow I'll tell you everything. - You are awful! - Come on, Lili. Relax. - Good night, Lili. - Good night. What a night! This time I trapped Beethoven. What was saying to his friend? I've the impression that the girl is like a sign of destiny. She happened to come into my life. And it's as if everything depended on her. Who knows! Maybe he is getting a crush too. Just imagine if he knew I was that girl! But maybe he's just curious. He likes other girls. I'd like to be tall, dark haired, fascinating. Bewitching! What if tomorrow I couldn't see you anymore. Perhaps you could get tired of me. What is enough for other people would not give me even a shadow of my lost happiness. What if tomorrow, and I underline "if", I should suddenly lose you, I would lose the whole world, and not only you. I'd like it to be like that! But it isn't. One, two...- We are gypsy girls that come from far away. We read the future of people on their hand. And what the future holds - is not a mystery to us. - Come in! We are gypsy girls who come from far away. What? Alright. I'll be right there. Thank you. I must leave for a few minutes. Miss Santangelo, you conduct. Behave. - Alright. - And above all, discipline. We are gypsy girls who come from far away. Girls, come! - You are very shrewd. - Now you know. - But you're wrong. - Never, really. But I say enough. Let me be and you will see - that I will forget you. - See-saw! - It's not my fault. - If between us... - There will be silence. - Which I wouldn't want. But I say enough. It is over for me. I am tired. You'll see - that I will leave you. - See-saw! You'll see me in your thoughts and remember everything about me. - You'll understand. - You'll understand. - That you were wrong. - That you were wrong. And if you should change... - I will forgive you. - See-saw! But I say enough. Let me be. And you will see - that I will forget you. - See-saw! You will see me in your thoughts and remember everything about me. - You'll understand. - You'll understand. - That you were wrong. - That you were wrong. But if you will change... - I will forgive you. - See-saw! You are great! - Ciccio is waiting at the lake. - Why? I have news that it worth 3 packs of cigarettes. - Give me 2 cigarettes. - No. I said 3 packs. - In fact. - Two are fine too. - In fact. - I said 2 packs. - Two cigarettes or nothing. - You don't know how to do business. What's the news? The music teacher is talking to that girl. - Where? - In the park near the pool. - You shouldn't have come. - I will do worse if you go on treating me like this. I'll tell your aunt everything. Go! Is this a threat? You didn't understand a thing. I am not afraid of my aunt. I don't want to upset her. But it would be better if she knew. Stop with this ridiculous story. You are here as a teacher for peanuts. I liked you because you were free, aggressive. That is my real life, and one day... Then allow me to finance you, to launch you in the world of music. No. Put that in your head, Lida. I will go my own way. I don't want help from anyone. My songs must be successful because people like them, but because you paid an advertising campaign. If you haven't yet understood, it's useless. I don't want to talk about it here. Someone could see us. Let's go. No. First tell me the truth. You don't love me anymore? No. I am just going through a strange period. I want to be alone. I am worried about the festival, about my songs... Promise that you'll come tomorrow at Canottieri. Dad will be there. Don't insist. I won't come to your father's club. Oh, God, the girls! Don't move. Act nonchalant. Why didn't you stay in class? The lesson was over. We wanted to listen to "Va pensiero". - If you are busy with the lady... - No! She teaches at the conservatory. Then she can listen to us. We do serious music, not yé-yé stuff. - Of course. - The teacher hates yé-yé. - Really? - Certainly. - Do you like it? - No. We don't either. We only study classical music here. - The teacher is so serious! - I should think so. Do you want to hear us?- Go thoughts... No, the lady must leave. Right, miss? I'll go if you promise to come tomorrow to that conference. Alright. If you insist, I'll come. - You are busy at the conservatory. - Goodbye, girls. - Goodbye. - Leave now. I'll be waiting for you at 3 p.m. at Canottieri. Yes. See you tomorrow. - Bye! - Bye! - What manners! - Torregiani, are you crazy? - Go thoughts... - Excuse me, miss! On golden wings. Go settle... So they have an appointment. Are you sure? Yes. Marisa heard very well. She said, "Tomorrow at 3 p.m. at Canottieri." - I am going too. - During recreation? - Yes. I won't leave Beethoven. - Lili! Marisa! - What is it? - Look what we found. - The teacher's hat! - Imitate Charlie Chaplain! We have the gardeners pants. - And his boots. - Come on! Do it. I've never seen you. I'll prepare the moustache. Come! I'll make the moustache with a burned cork. Wait... They said you are very good at imitating Charlie Chaplain. I've never seen you. Here's the gardener's jacket. You want it? - Here. - Look at the moustache I made! Put it on. - We need a bow tie. - Mine! - We need a cane. - Let's get this one from the ivy. Watch out. Don't break the plant. - There. - I'll put it on with a hair pin. - How do I look? - You're magnificent. Girls, let's get down! I'm looking for Titina, Titina, oh Titina! I'm looking for her and can't find her. I wonder where she is! I am looking for Titina, Titina, Titina. I am looking for Titina. I wonder where she is! Where can she be? Where can she be? You're right, but that's how I am and there's nothing doing. Be quiet, love. The farther away you are, the closer I feel you. I wonder what you are thinking at this moment, what you are doing. You put a poison in my veins that is sweet. This cross I carry for you isn't heavy. I want you, I think of you, I call you. I see you, I feel you, I dream of you. A year has gone by, just think. A year has gone by since these eyes have had no peace. And I walk, I walk, but don't know where I'm going. I am always drunk, but I never drink wine. I made a vow to the Madonna of Snow promising her that if this fever goes away I will give Her pearls and gold. I want you, I think of you, I call you. I see you, I feel you, I dream of you. A year has gone by, just think. A year has gone by since these eyes have had no peace. A year has gone by, just think. A year has gone by since these eyes have had no peace. I'm sorry to have interrupted your lesson, but something very serious happened. Go ahead. Santangelo, Caraffa, Torregiani, go to your rooms. At 10, go to the Council Room. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - What happened? - Will they shoot us at dawn? You are too funny... Mosquitoes. The lesson is over. You can go. This time we are in trouble. - Will they kick us out? - Don't worry. Let me handle it. I'll explain everything. How did they find the paper? It's obvious. I think it was her, Bonfanti. Look at her that squealer. She is talking to Catherine Spaak. If she did it, she pay dearly for it. Rita, I found out that it was her. - Who? Bonfanti? - Yes. - Do you have evidence? - She told Teresa to have given "The Mosquito" to Catherine Spaak. Just as I imagined! But this time she made a mistake. She will pay dearly for this! - Let's hope they don't kick us out. - Come on! In concluding, faculty, this paper is highly disrespectful. I propose that all those who are guilty should leave. Do any of you have any questions to ask? I do. I'd like to understand why the suggestion to shave legs. What, in your mind, can despise the young hair of an adolescent? What, in the endocrine activity of the hair bulbs, is in opposition with your subconscious? Why don't you like the hair? It is useless. In fact, it is called "superfluous" hair. - I don't understand. - Neither do I. You don't understand and clearly like it. Just look at your legs. Do you have anything to ask? - No. I... - I do. I'd like to know why such untouched girls, who tomorrow will be wives and mothers of children, dedicate an entire illustrated column, and I repeat, illustrated, to this "coccodè"... to this "caccavè"... to this Japanese wrestling. - There. - Can you come a minute, Mr. Paolo? Why not? Let's see. - We will get an idea. - Go, so we can see. Alright. - Personal defense. - Defense? It's a personal offense! - She even hurt me. - Yes. If you had been a thief, I would've known how to defend myself. If you'd done it to me, I'd have stayed in bed 2 months. The body of the faculty is not being respected. They are trying to ridicule us. - You never laughed at teachers? - Never! I don't want you in my class! - That is very serious. - Appalling! Now we'll talk about the main topic of this paper, the column, "Every girl has a right to a boyfriend". How can you justify this kind of column? We are girls. What should we think? "I am your Peppino. Stop. I am running to you. Stop." - "I love you. Stop. Peppino." - They confirmed. They only think of men! And they are right! Oh, excuse me. I wanted to say that we must understand them. We can't reason like spinsters. At night a girl can't dream of the Pythagorean Theorem. Girls dream of love and that's how it should be. Each girl should be able to dream of a boyfriend. - Acquitted! - Bravo! She has gone crazy! She acquitted them! She jeopardized the authority of the whole faculty. - Yes, in fact. - A little comprehension... It's outrageous! I'm sorry for Catherine Spaak, but Luigiona was pleasant and intelligent. - We're meeting at the tennis club. - Just a minute. Now we have something more important to do. Punishment to the spy. Revenge! The Bonfanti hunt begins. - Ok! - Let's go. - You've been on it an hour. Get off! - I'm calling the teacher! Push! Finally! Let's surround her! You look here. It's useless to run away! I'll catch you. Stop! Come, Marisa! Stop! You, over there! Surrender. You better not run away. You are surrounded. - Leave her alone! - What do you want? Not three against one. Leave her just to me. Come on! What are you doing on the ground? Get up and walk! You are a worm! A filthy spy! Are you giving up? Confess that you are a filthy spy! Say it. I am a filthy spy. I am a filthy spy. - Rita's whistle. - Let's go! Girls, Bonfanti wants to tell you something. Speak up! Go on! - I am a filthy spy. - Continue. Did you hear? You must not trust me anymore because I am a worm. Repeat that. - I am a worm. - Did you hear? - That is why I punish myself. - Go! That way, you'll learn. Oh, Beethoven! What's he doing? Reading? What is that? The Rio Carnival. Maybe he is sensitive to exotic fascination. He likes women like Carmen Miranda with all that salad on her head. I wonder how he would react if he met a woman like that. Maybe here in the boarding school. Divina! Divina! Too bad I'm not "Chica chica boom". You are so unpleasant! Come back, love. Come back to your lovely woman. Come back, love, to your lovely woman. Lovely? How frightening fright! Peppino left me 20 years ago. He remembers me as young and pretty. Will I disappoint him? I'll do everything not to disappoint you. Do everything to me! - Everything? - Everything? - Very well, madam. René! - Yes? - Madam is doing everything. - Please, madam. I look good. I look very good. I am a pleasure for the eyes. For being a middle aged woman, I'm not to be thrown away. My legs aren't bad, either. A lovely French woman! Shame on you! I tell you since I'm the voice of your conscience. You are so boring! Instead of criticizing, give me advice. Shall I keep these eyelashes or take them off? When Peppino will look into my eyes, he'll say, "What lovely eyes!" Of course he'll say it. Look at them! They are two stars, two headlights, a provocation. If he kisses me and a fake eyelash gets stuck on his lip? How embarrassing! When Plato created the demiurge... - Who is it? - It comes from the principal office. Holy Virgin, a naked woman! How did she get inside here? We must advise the principal. - Donna Luigia! - Call me Luigina! Madonna of Carmine, it's her! Transformed! Auntie... you! I hadn't recognized you. You are so... - I meant that you are so pretty. - You think I look good? Very much! And now, Rita Santangelo. Ladies and gentlemen, now we will give a music award to the student... - What is her name? - Santangelo. The student Santangelo, music award winner. And in saying music... I confess that this single word arouses a storm inside of me. Bellini, Puccini, Rossini, Caruso, Tamagno. In other words, music. And in awarding the student... - What is her name? - Santangelo. Oh! Miss Santangelo, I intend to award... I don't know if it's clear... I intend to award... Who should I award? Miss Santangelo for music. Excuse me. Miss Santangelo for music! Here. My compliments. Bravo! Very good. I hope that you will be just as diligent in your studies. I have concluded. The ceremony is over. - My compliments. - My compliments to you too. Miss Santangelo is really talented. She is one of our best elements. A little vivacious, but worthy of our esteem and our affection. I would like that this evening Miss Sant'Agnello... Santangelo! Santangelo, yes. I'd like her to sit with us at the faculty table. She will be honored. - I don't want to hear. - You must listen to me. Tonight I must absolutely go to that festival. I have an idea, but you must help me. I didn't imagine that the superintendent would invite me. - Tonight of all nights. - You ask me? Cinnamon! I have reason to comment on such behavior. Vanilla! I must make a cake now. If I don't do so right away, it will be a mess. What that woman did to me! What this woman did to me. But she's forgiven you. She is a good person, actually. Good! She is waiting for that thing... Did you see how she's decked out? She isn't the same anymore, and to be honest, I don't like her anymore! She is a real bewitcher... Woman, you are a bewitcher. That song suits perfectly. - Then take revenge. - Yes! Revenge is necessary. Carmelo Pappagone won't accept this shame. What should we do? - Send them away. - Who? Them. - Employees, go away! - Me? Yes, go on. He always talks. Well? How shall we take revenge? What is it? Oh, Saint Gennaro! Aren't you ashamed? You were the one to always play those stupid jokes. - But I... - You think you are funny? You do things that not even a first year student would laugh at. You act like a brat, and at your age, it's ridiculous! When will you grow up? If not in height, at least with your brain! We are broadcasting the Neapolitan night festival. Turn it off! Esteemed director, I would like you to read my modest publication dedicated to the study of the psychological influence - of television on young people. - Send it to me. That's fine, thank you. This cake is delicious. I've never eaten one so good. Thank you. Santangelo, taste the cake. I ate too much, thank you. Enough! You want to get me drunk? Excuse me. Too bad the poor music teacher didn't participate in our dinner. He had to run to a sick relative. His great aunt. I hope she doesn't get worse during the evening. - So... - As I was saying... My notes illuminate the pedagogic weight... of the TV shows dedicated... - To youngsters. - Excuse me! You're ruining the dinner. I said it's ok. Send me the notes and I'll read them. Now if I may... Excuse me. I'd like to say a few words to the faculty and the excellent principal of this Maria Adelaide boarding school. You're yawning too? Forgive me, but I saw everyone yawning and I had the urge to yawn too. Maybe these Salerno wines have that effect. What is happening to me? He's touching her. What is he doing? There. Like that. Perfect, Carmelo! - What a lovely scene! - Everyone fell asleep. - What is going on? - Don't interfere! - What about her? - She fell asleep. Seen? She stole too, like you do. - I am going to change. - Alright. Look at what a scene! Miss, are you sure that the sleeping substance I put in the cake was harmless? Yes, don't worry. Look, Lili. Isn't it great? We should call all the girls. - They're already at the gate! - Bonfanti? We'll take her too. You go ahead. I'll get dressed and join you. - Have fun! - Bye! Best wishes! Best wishes! What lovely music! She is off tune. There she is. There she is! There she is! Lovely, ungrateful and cruel. Why did you refuse my love? I would like to kiss you. I would like to kiss you. Oh, God! The girls must have forgotten something. Snore! Snore! Sleep! Sleep! Snore! Snore! We'll talk in the kitchen, thief! - Who is it? - Professor Del Grande. - You can't enter. - I must see the principal! - She's not here! - I don't believe you! Luigia! My Luigina! I know that voice. It's my Peppino's voice. Peppino, where are you? My Peppino! - Let me by. - Where are you? Where are you, Peppino? Professor Del Grande is entering! Nothing will be an obstacle to my love! Del Grande is passing! - You won't. - Move that leg! You are not going in. - You are not going in! - Luigia, my love! Don't touch the "rever"! Don't touch the rever. I said not to touch my rever! - What is it? - It's the lapel! Call it lapel! - Luigina, my love! - Don't move! - Peppino... - Leave me alone. - Luigia, my love! - I won't let you go! My love! She fainted! How sweet! She's abandoned herself. We haven't met for 20 years. Luigia, my love! When she saw you, she fell asleep, she was so bored. - That's nonsense. - Nonsense? She is sleeping, she's snoring! - It's the love rattle. - Rattle? She is snoring. Listen. She is really snoring! After 20 years, you fall asleep as soon as I arrive? You drugged her! You did something to her. I don't believe... - Are you kissing her? - No... Kiss your sister! - My sister is dead. - Luigia, it's Peppino. - My little girl! - My Luigina! - What are you doing? - I like you so much! - Enough! - Enough! - Why are you kissing me? - Enough! Ladies and gentleman, the performance is about to begin. I will scream as much as I want! I will sing your song badly so you'll learn! - Stop it! - No! That's it, break everything! You are crazy. - I'm leaving. I'm fed up. - Go away! I am leaving for good! Ladies and gentlemen, the performance is starting. The dressing rooms are over there. I knew it! Come. What is it? Flowers? Beautiful. Who sends them? Great blow! Come on! The basket. Hurry! Go... to Rio de Janeiro. Just think when she wakes up in Brazil! Let's go! - What will you have? - Something strong. Whatever. You have to forget? Yes! The festival opens the doors to the younger generation. A young singer will now sing... It's her! She's the one singing! It's her. She's singing my song! - What about this? - Drink it to my health! - We have a riff. - Geghe geghe geghegé! - That goes like this. - Geghe geghe geghegé! This riff means that... My greeting is geghegé. Maybe you think that this geghe geghegé means geghegé. Instead, this riff means "I love you". And we will all dance. With this geghegé you can tell me whatever you want, but you don't know how. - We have a riff. - Geghe geghe geghegé! - That goes like this. - Geghe geghe geghegé! I say it to you. Bravo! Fantastic! Wait for me here. I want to have her sign a contract. This girl is wild, but she is great. She is amazing. This other performance instead is shameful! Luigia, you must wake up. Poor me! She is a real bewitcher! And so we will all dance together. With geghegé you can tell me whatever you want, but you don't know how. - We have a riff. - Geghe geghe geghegé! - That goes like this. - Geghe geghe geghegé! I say it to you and you say it to me! Let's do the geghegé together. Mr. Teddy Reno, what do you think? The best singer I've ever heard. I knew! - Bravo! - Amazing! Come to see me after the show. I'll offer you a contract! Bravo! Really good! Come here! Stop! Are you crazy? Stop her! - Is she a thief? - No, she's my girlfriend. Stop! Why are you running away? You sing my song, slap me and run away? Come here! Stop! Why are you running away? Where are you going? My tie! Stop! Excuse me. Follow that taxi! Hurry! Yes, that one! Hurry! It's a matter of life or death! - This taxi is ours. - Who is she? Please! If he reaches us, it's over for me. Is he a scoundrel? Poor girl! - Many times life... - What life? Get off my husband's lap. - Of course. - Look at her - Do you hear me? - What manners! It's useless for you to run away. I'll follow you to hell. Go away! Stop following me. No. Even if you don't want to hear it, I'm telling you anyway. - I love you! - You don't know who I am. You love someone who doesn't exist. I don't care who you are. I love you! Do you hear me? I love you! I don't even like you. Do you hear me? I don't like you! But I love you. Well, I hate you! - I love you! - I hate you! - I adore you! - I hate you! Crazy! Hurry, or we'll lose her! - Have her get off! - What manners! They turned around and are stopping. - Where are we? - In Edenlandia. It's the city of entertainment, but it's closed now. Can you ferry me over to the ship? It's closed. - Please. - I am an evil pirate! Stop! What are you doing? Come here! Stop the boat! - It'll break! - Where is it going? - She'll break the boat. - Stop! We interrupt our program to give the festival results. - The winner is the song "Geghegé"! - I won! You won! - Love, we won! - We won! Stop, love! We won! You will be happy now. You got what you wanted. Love, stop running away! - Please. - Leave me alone! Why are you doing this? The two of us must be together. I don't care about the festival if you aren't with me. Get off that ship. I don't know how to join you. I came here so that you couldn't follow me. - Go away. - Alright. He left. So much the better. I'm coming! I told you I'd follow you all the way to hell! Where are you running to? - Santangelo? - Yes, I am she. I am that brat, and am glad that you found out. - I did it on purpose. - Be quiet. If you aren't quiet, how can I ask you to marry me? What did you say? Be quiet!
