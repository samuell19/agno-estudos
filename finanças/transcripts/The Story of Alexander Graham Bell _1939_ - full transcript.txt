It's me miss McGregor. Joe Elliott Come in. Well, what is it? - Amy wanted I should come over to tell you she can't do the clothes this week. She stove up with cold. And she sent you ten miles just to tell me the that. You know Amy. Once she's got something to say she's gonna say it now. Besides it only took about two hours the way I came Good night. - Good night, Joe. Kelly to take a hot lemonade and sweat it out. I will, thank you. Good night. - Good night. that lies to my breasts at one cherishing word that lols is one big Xander dreaming of light and Canberra she's very light oh look he's hiding Dominick's is holy like going to the theater for nothing what do you say folks if we organize the quartet right here mr. calhoune will be the baritone I'll carry the lead Tom will be the tenor all we need is bass how about you went through why he couldn't carry a tune in a bucket perhaps our new boarder mr. Bell might do who the professor our young genius bells all right just different but do you suppose he really believes he can teach that deaf and dumb child he brought here to talk all I can say is if the Lord intended dumb people to talk he'd have taken care of it oh excuse me oh come in mr. bear miss McGregor do you have any any copper wire in the house a big picture wire I'll do copper wire yes I I need about 17 feet for one of my experiments and all the shops are closed at this hour why the idea of expecting to find 17 feet of wire at this time of night well I never heard of such a thing mr. Bale well I'm sorry if I bothered you good night adjustable wood professor don't figure an impertinence and we've just been wondering if it's true you can teach dumb people to talk I hope to someday you see mr. Darcy the reason deaf mutes can't speak is that they have bad ears and not not bad vocal cords never having heard speech they can't imitate it so if we can find a way to to visualize sound for them and there's no reason why they shouldn't speak as well as any one of us is there no I guess not no of course not would you stay and show us some of your tricks mr. Bell tricks yes it would be such fun I've heard you make the piano play by just talking to it oh well I'll be glad to but they're they're not tricks please they're very simple manifestations of the of the nature of sound and of vibrations in the air now first I push down the sustaining pedal then I depress the key doh doh ray me far so Mart's positively spooky oh no no not at all mrs. McGregor sound is nothing but air in motion when I sing the scales I set up certain vibrations which fall on the strings of the piano just as they fall on the membranes of our ears thus producing corresponding vibrations or sounds is that clear No mr. bell the little boy's father's here to see you with another gentleman Mr Sanders thank you excuse me please mr. bell that's a dandy act I bet you could do something with but thank you Miss Darcy I expect to and alali flow mr. Sanders always he just fine I want you to meet my friend and gardener Herbert Alexander Graham Bell mr. Hubbard of course I know you by my reputation your your interest in the Clark School for the Deaf I've been hearing about you too and your work with Sanders boy would you like to go out and see George became Hall please that's the multiple Telegraph Bell is working on if it works and I'm sure my theory is right I ought to be able to send as many as 50 messages at a time over one wire get him interested Alec and your financial worries are over he's the best organizer in Boston he's the man who brought gets to this towns well I'll be delighted to explain it to you sir you see when I press this letter all the time mr. Bell some other time right now I'm more interested in what you're doing for Sanders boy than I am in any newfangled invention oh yes we'll go right in excuse me this way please me may we see George he's asleep but I'm sure he'd want to see his father go ahead sir shall I speak to him I told him to shake hands with you and he understood you you saw what he did now I'm asking you if I should tell you how our glove works we began by teaching him to spell simple words like CIT and then showing him a cat now by touching the letters or or other combination of letters I can talk to him as rapidly as I can to you but I understood you were teaching him to actually speak what's this have you ever succeeded in teaching a child it was born deaf to speak no and as far as I know nobody else has but I have great hopes and they'll still young but he's had some mighty interesting experiences with sound and speech tell about the melody well I crumble family that that has made a professional study on mechanism of speech for two generations before me my grandfather Alexander Bell and my father Alexander Melville Bell were elocutionist who devoted their entire lives to the correction of defects of speech perhaps you've read some of their books on the subject well from earliest childhood I was trying to become a teacher of speech that and the fact that my mother was deaf led me to my present interest in deaf mutes and well mute wires like The Telegraph mr. Bell I have a little girl of my own that I want you to work with she had scarlet fever when she was 4 years old it had left her stone deaf I've had her in Germany learning lip-reading well I'm sorry sir but when I'm not working with George I spend all my time working on my Telegraph come over to supper to Saturday night and we'll talk it over well I hope you like beans Boston baked beans no not much and besides you like the kind my cook prepares come on Sanders it's 2 and a half minutes past 9:00 nevermind Ellie you'll have a fine chance to tell him about your Telegraph instrument Saturday night it's kind of slippery isn't it young lady may I suggest the sidewalk is no place for sleds the sidewalk is very narrow the ice makes one's footing very uncertain you might have ruined the most important piece of electrical equipment the city of Boston oh I can excuse such behavior in children but I but I don't well what did you say I said you are no longer a child and that I think I'm sorry would you mind speaking a little more distinctly young lady I come from a long line of elocution teachers my grandfather my father wrote text books on the subject I think I know what I'm speaking distinctly goodnight I'm sorry but you see I the essential parts of both my transmitter and my receiver are these tune reads made of flattened steel clock Springs one end of which is attached to poles of these electromagnets while the other end is free to vibrate over the other poles like this interesting isn't it dear 626 mother yes dear but I'm sure separate would be aankhon the transmitter has maken breakpoints ah come in my dear come in mr.

Bell makes things dear he was just telling us about his Telegraph when you came in I beg your pardon AMA his Telegraph Telegraph that oh please go on oh yes please we do have to hear about it well I was just saying when a spring sends its electrical tone into the wire theoretically only its mate and receiver should respond and if I set up a number of sets of Springs tuned to different pitches then I could send a similar number of messages over the same wire I'm sorry if I said anything out there to offend you but you didn't of course not and and do go on well that's about all except that it may not work oh but it will work I'm sure they suffered a service of it thank you no uh-uh this is a third successive night suppose been late I'm sorry dear I'll speak to cook gold on girls mr. bell supper mr. bell I hope you like beans of Boston baked beans didn't you think you had a very nice face Oh papa you know very well I didn't mean papa oh then you mean mr. bell yeah so good mr. bell why thought he looked all right for playing man didn't you think your nice nose it was awfully Roman or something oh yes nice eyes to it blaze so when he talks I think you're in love navel oh goody navel survived many Father loves good it was advertising for fog putting money in this telegram imagine Papa green to pay for his experiment mr. bells is the first voice I've ever really wanted to hear oh darling of course he's wonderful he's a mom do you think you like me Gertie I mean even if I can of course he will that'll make him like you ten times as much you won't feel sorry for me it won't be that will it oh no of course not then I go to marry what I'm going to marry him I knew it the first time I saw him I just made up my mind like that look papa Oh what will the posse I don't care what the boss says I'll just close my eyes and then it won't be able to hear him and besides but pom doesn't know yet nobody must know yet only you oh but you know how I am about secrets I'll just die if I can't tell it but you won't tell this Gertie you promise me you won't tell well I won't if you promise to tell me everything he says he does alright alright I promise Shh Gertrude you and Mable stop that foolish cheddar don't you know it's exactly 11 minutes past 10:00 put out the lights and go to bed yes Papa why did you say is that to go to bed you know if you had married him I would Oh girdi don't you love New England in the spring mr. bell sprained yes is very nice we often come out here for picnics mother and father and well all of us you do I'm sorry mr. bell but you'll have to look at mirror I can't see what you're saying oh sorry Oh won't you tell me what's wrong won't yes yes you've hardly spoken a word to me since we started have I said I've done anything to offend you oh no certainly not it's just that well I've been thinking yeah you see it may take years before I get anywhere with the Telegraph and I was just wondering whether or not I ought to go on with it go on with it suppose I don't want to wait suppose are things I want to do now while I'm young things I might do if I gave all my time to a regular position like teaching at Boston University or something what sort of things do you want stupid oh I don't know me a wife whom finish your Telegraph first the wife will wait she will oh yes mr. bell I'm sure she will oh oh thank you but that's all I wanted to know oh but but there's something else I ought to tell you yeah I'm not as interested in the Telegraph as I used to be you're not no ever since I went to Brantford to visit my family last Christmas I'd had a new idea rattling around in my head he did the biggest idea I've ever had in my life all the craziest wouldn't you like to tell me about it well I have an idea but if I could make a kind of electricity vary in intensity exactly as the air varies in density when sound passes through it then then I could transmit sound even speech telegraphic Lee I'm sorry but I don't understand I mean I could talk through a wire talk through a why yes I could send a human voice as far as wires could be strung hah but that doesn't seem possible uh-huh I can't believe it it's talking through a wire I guess it's crazy oh when you going to start work on it mr. bell Monday night Thomas Watson an electrician who makes all my apparatus for me is moving in with me to help me oh then then you were really asking me for my endorsement and not my adviser something like that huh mr. bell if you spend all your time working on this how will you live oh I'll manage somehow but don't think I want to use the money your father lends me for anything but the Telegraph oh no I'm gonna work on this new idea in my spare time oh yes yes I am mr. him but mr. Bell if I were you I wouldn't tell my father about this yeah you see he gets off the upset if people don't finish what they started out to do couldn't this be our secret for a little while anyway perhaps that would be why is he and safer how much safer mr. Bell much mother Oh mother neighbor we're on any you did Oh mother I've just been to the most glorious Drive in the world happen hmm Mabel do you realize what time it is you missed your supper oh please papa don't scold me tonight not tonight we've been worrying about you for hours something might have happened to you child it's all right now garden it was all my fault huh bird I talked so much neither of us noticed the time no and and finally we had to stop under the streetlight so so I could see what he was saying but I'm just slipped by yes mother alla get such wonderful ideas Alec Alec Oh I mean mr. bell well please call me Alec all right mr. bell won't you stay and have something to eat oh no no not now I I must be going but I good night in summer good night good night mr.

Amos al hurry here she comes yeah take this awful thing find you on the entire quarter and leave one all-night party known as Williams Electric Company well we're slow are you gonna take with that I'm ready now we can try it again honest I know penis I'm just a plain ordinary man all right sweep like a human do and I oh I've got a sitter day after day night after night wasting away tapping a little piece of metal I do remember when I used to know pretty girls been in another world mumble maybe on the birth of great discovery long as I can remember we found the bird look here I can only find four new Springs I thought I told you to get hired I'm sure I told you to get five I remember now you had just enough money to pay for the five new Springs of 25 cents each now where is that on the spring I ate it you did what I didn't mean to I was going along and I I saw that food in the window suddenly I got such a craving I couldn't stand it I went by twice I tried not to go in but I couldn't help but I was hungry I can't go on living forever with so you ate one of my Springs you took the last 25 cents we had to fill your miserable little stuff yes I did I told you I'm no genius I'm through starving I'll go out to the Indian territory lived on buff fair steak and you or nobody else's stuff wait all the paint off that you might why money is yours is show me show me what what did you do it - I didn't do anything but you did something I saw it I heard it Moo little spring stopped vibrating I just plucked at that saw but I heard a sound a full musical note with overtones through the wire show me everything you did well this this contact screw grad stack make a pun on contact with the spring yes I just snapped it while the while the circuit remained unbroken I suppose so then that strip a magnetized steel was generating its own current do it again no wait no wait wait a minute wait all right wow it worked it works it works I read it again are you an Indian Jordan Chenal the Six Nations tuck me in well that makes it all right then don't you understand we've accidentally found the undulating current that I've been looking for for the first time in the history of the world we've sent sound through a wire for the first time nothing well this has happened in nearly every electrician what you mean is it's the first time the right man is hurted know what it meant is that true why certainly if you know anything about electricity you hadn't paid any attention to it well anyhow I was there that's the important thing just think we started to work on a telegram and now we're on the trail of the electric telephone telephone instead it's an apparatus for transmitting the voice it means sound from afar gear your whole day where you going well going going to challenge to tell Mabel of course telephone mr. bear where's miss Mable she's upstairs sir I'll tell her you're here oh well would you please put the gas up in the parlour sir well I tell miss Mable you're here ask him hurry please it's awfully important very good sir Alec Maebh hi Mabel I've just discovered them all Mabel now we can get married will you marry me hurry tell me yes you will who goes that Ike oh thank you but I never had any other intention oh no not here Alec don't you gotta tell me you love me oh please I want to hear you say I love you darling it's a dark in here I can't see nothing I love you again I love you don't move don't even breathe I want to remember this moment all alone just as it is oh I forgot what what I came here to tell you my telephone I've got it I've found a way to talk through a wire how did you heaven that's why I asked you to marry me you wait here I've got to tell you fun no no no I like he's he's reading and maybe a better wait what me you tell your mom the girls I'll handle him mr. Hubbard just a moment mr. bell I always allow myself 30 minutes with the classics every evening in the past 40 years I daresay I haven't missed three such evenings except perhaps on my honeymoon habit habit mr. Bell is the important thing setting a regular time for everything and sticking to it yes sir but what lesson there are young people today or in trying to postpone to shift dodge and put on my father always said people were prepared to make any effort the day after tomorrow but when it comes to doing a thing today that's another matter how we say go no no thank you I just want on go and smoke it there's nothing like a good cigar to help settle your stomach now mr. bell you wanted to see me yes sir maple night get married now sit down mr. bell this afternoon I made a very valuable discovery I actually sent sound through a wire without the use of battery so you what before Lorna I'll be able to send speech talk from any distance before how long I don't know but I'm sure I'll make a telephone Sunday telephone huh what about your Telegraph oh I'm gonna give that up this is much bigger and newer as my daughter accepted you yes sir and she loves me too mr. bell when I married the lady you proposed to make your mother-in-law I was owning 4,000 dollars a year in addition I had certain prospects for my father which promised ample security for my wife and children may I ask what prospects you have well I haven't any prospects unless it's the telephone mr. bell I'd like to call your attention to a few peculiarities which I've observed about your character or I know I'm not worthy ever sir in the first place I'd say you are emotionally unstable you jump from one enthusiasm to another with reckless abandon to begin with it was the multiple Telegraph that consumed your time and energies now you tell me you're no longer interested in the telegraph but have gone skipping off in pursuit of some new proposition but mr. Hubbard mr. bell you may waste your own time if you please but the sooner you stop wasting my money the better I won't give this up I can't in that case disabuse your mind of the idea of marrying my daughter but mr. Hubbard we love each other nevertheless you are not to come here again mr. bell or even attempt to see my daughter not so long as you persist in this folly by them all if you propose to give up a possibly profitable venture for an air castle you needn't expect any more support for me I wash my hands of the whole business but mr. Hubbard none 12 after 8 I should have been well past Harvard Square by now would you like to accompany me on my constitutional mr. Bell the night air is very refreshing no thank you well good night now take this little egg i crack it I'd drop it tenderly into the grease that quiver isn't is still result hunger but take this same little egg I leave it to nestled tenderly and lovingly under its mother's breast snug and warm soon it becomes flesh and feathers then it too is dropped tenderly into the grease again it Quivers and is still result a feast listenmi my fine friend so I'm gonna stand over a hot stove night after night you can't expect me to live on half an a God fall apart I'm sick of me I'm sick of the very thought of you hey that's what I think of the hours the months we've wasted on that stupid idea you say you're tired you're hungry or saw my I don't look like other men just as much as you do I want a decent bed to sleep indeed decent food to eat but in love I want to get married and I will and if I ever have a child that that so much as looks at a piece of copper wire or mentions electricity out what about all your work your plans it's all done how much were you getting up there Williams Electric Company three dollars a day why better see if a job is still open Lee I won't be needing you anymore you're quitting yes I'm going back to teaching the Deaf if I ever decide to work on the Telegraph home do it my spare time the telephone uh it was just on air kiss does Mabel know about this no I'm gonna write her now you got any paper where do we get any paper this'll do what's the date June 11 June 11 mother yes dear Heather I've got to see Alan I know dear I know what you've been through this past month no I mean now I've got to go to him come on Mabel to his room have you gone out of your mother I can't help it I must see him now today this minute oh my child what would your father say that my eyes are closed I'm not listening to you oh please you got to go with me I've got to see him but a lead you can't give up your telephone just because father says so that it'd be criminal I know what I want and I've made up my mind to heaven perhaps alec is right dear Oh mother why do you say that you know he's not right but after all you two love each other isn't that enough it is for me well that isn't to me Alec if you give up your telephone I I promise I'll never marry Oh may I mean it Alec child child it's up to Jean Mabel I'll never fail you again never Oh you wake mm-hmm what are you thinking about Mabel so was that I I was thinking now I got to make a telephone I've got to find a receiver some way to get speech I'd all I'll be just as badly off as I was before she came here would it be wonderful if we should invent the telephone had turned out to be the very thing that could make her hear you had any imagination and you anything about sound you know that can't happen how do you know you aren't God I know because in the human ear when vibrations strike against the eardrum they caused tiny bones in the back of the head to oscillate but enables case the nerve current and back of those bones has been permanently injured even if sound waves caused the bones to oscillate cause the bones to oscillate oscillate oscillate Anjali what what what I got it I got ya what's st. vitus day no no the ear what hear this this here we hear it come on come on get up we've got to get an ear a human ear and study it it may give us just what we need for our receiver you're crazy where are you gonna get a human ear I'll sharpen my razor and you go out never mind never mind we'll get in here somehow and maybe maybe this time just think out of Mabel's deafness we make the whole world here ya know but on here a human ear you can't do that well use the same principle as the ear exactly only we use gold beater skin instead of membrane and and a small piece of metal in front of an electromagnet instead of the bones and we'll use more batteries that's what we gotta have more batteries yeah it's gonna take a lot of money gold beater skin batteries acids we'll get them somehow maybe you can get another advance for mr. Sanders no no I gotta figure some of the way I've had three advances from him already for less and less work with George we could both of us go back to work for a little while be nice to eat again fer change too no no that's that's not the way we've got to find a cheaper place to live cheaper than this certainly what I wouldn't stay here even even if they'd let us use the shop that it's too noisy too dangerous there's there too many people about we're not gonna tell anybody what we're doing yet we'll starve maybe you will but me until I've made it telephone charming place such atmosphere boiled cabbage and flat beer I'd say oh it's you well don't forget mister Bell this is for lodgings only you think you got to get any food without paying for it you got another thing coming understand lady we only eat at the Parker house you laugh $0.50 be alright Merry Christmas sir we're Christmas turkeys twelve and a half cents a pound extra fine I may come back for one later on yes right now I'll ever have fond of cheese and two apples very good sir sure you don't want this no if at all I want apples and cheese cheese and app what's the matter I don't know everything went black in front of me I feel so dizzy maybe I'd better lie down for a few minutes were you lied you haven't eaten I don't I don't think I was hungry now you stay on the bed I'm going out and get something to eat to find out back in 15 minutes you know I got caught you see anything with an ear on it bring it back please ah stomachs are funny things I know I should growl like a lion when you neglect him fill him up again they settle down / just like a kitten sure nobody saw you I saw him chasing the cat so I expect I'm saving up yeah how that these cigars were sort of a nice afterthought I had my heart set on a plum pudding when I couldn't find it we should find a well done battery with a supposing all out of it well we can't sit here all day let's get to work on Christmas Eve what's the matter with Christmas Eve well Christmas may not mean anything to you but it does to me I'm not moving I'm gonna sit right here and belch till morning whoa mr.

Bell wanted for his telephone together with a stamped acknowledgment from the Williams Electric Company acknowledging receipt of the order On June 30 1875 what is that writing mr.

Bell was very poor man he had no other paper I wish to write thank you mrs. Bell you may step down I offer this letter in evidence as Exhibit 17 to the plaintiff Your Honor I'm sure we've all been touched by this little excursion into romance but now if we may compose ourselves I'd like to ask why if such a letter existed it wasn't produced days ago and more particularly why my learned colleague hasn't produced the man Williams in court to substantiate his signature unfortunately mr. Williams is no longer available as a witness oh really and why not surely it would be worth your while to bring mr. Williams here let us have a look at mr. Williams is dead oh he's dead how very unfortunate mr. bell now very convenient your honor without my knowledge and against my wishes my wife came into this courtroom at a time like this to read to you a letter intended for her eyes alone have I committed some offense by starving in an attic by spending sleepless nights at my work by being too poor to own a decent scrap of paper on which to tell her of my love I have sat here for days and heard myself called liar thief fraud and cheat I've seen my friends humiliated my invention belittled just as I have seen my business destroyed by methods which must leave every honest man appalled Your Honor we protest against this interruption yes you happen we had enough of this sentimental nonsense I demand that this man be declared in contempt of court mr. barrows we're all here in the interest of truth and I don't think mr.
