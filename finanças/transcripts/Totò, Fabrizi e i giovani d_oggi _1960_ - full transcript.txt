&gt; Giovanni: Well! But I say! &gt; Matilde: But how! &gt; Teresa: You can't do anything! &gt; Giuseppe: Always messes! &gt; Antonio: I turned it upside down! &lt;Giuseppe: There is nothing to do! &lt;Matilde: Here! Here! &gt; Lina: Do you remember, grandpa, how it rained? Wet bride lucky bride. [Of course now, with things done, everything seems to have been simple.] [But to get to this blessed wedding, ..] [.. many headaches, screams, sacrifices, ..] [.. especially for Cavalier Antonio Cocozza, ..] [.. renowned pastry chef founded in 1902, father of the bride ..] [.. and for the less renowned accountant Giuseppe D'A more, ..] [..but appreciated civil servant , father of the groom.] [It all started about a year ago, when Gabriella and Carlo met.] [He was studying for surveyor and she attended interpreting school.] [They met on a beautiful day in May ..] [ .. in the place where young people usually spend ..] [... their busy mornings of study.] - What are you watching? - Who is that beautiful girl? &lt;Carlo: I'd like to meet you. And introduce yourself! - Who did it? - It was him? - Sorry, I don't do that anymore. &lt;Carlo: But no, don't be afraid. Indeed, thanks. - For charity! - Thanks! [It is really true that in life, sometimes, ..] [.. a little push is enough and you don't know where it can lead you to end up.] [The summer passed, the tough exam period came ..] [..and Carlo began to study seriously.] [Think about the love he makes you do sometimes .] [The last exams were, of course, the heaviest.] [And so, one day ...] Carlo: Gabriella! Gabriella! Carlo: Gabriella, come here! I have great news! - What's up? - I've done it! I've done it! - Gabriella, I graduated! - Good boy! - Long last! &lt;Instructor: Miss! Miss, what have you done? Right now it was about to take place! - She's already placed! - As? - With me she placed herself! &lt;Friend: Gabriella! Are you crazy? - Will you marry me? - Yup! [And so all that remained was to inform the respective parents.] [This is where the real trouble usually begins.] [Her father immediately said ....] I said no! No! I'm not saying that you got engaged to your mother. I was crazy! Dig it yourself! And who knows this boyfriend of yours? Do you know him? But yes I know him: he has a high school diploma, he's nice, .. .. he loves me very much and he is also beautiful. - It's nice? - Yes. - I understand everything. Then it means that he doesn't have a lira. - But how do you know? - I know, because rich boyfriends are enclosed. Conversely, the beautiful ones are poor and go hunting for a dowry. No, dad, you are wrong. Carlo is not a dowry hunter. - Oh no? - No! - Not a dowry hunter? Anyway, he's got to get along with your mother, the gamekeeper. - So you tell the gamekeeper? - You are boring, my daughter! Boring! I'll tell him! All right! - When do you tell him? - When? Today Tomorrow,.. .. the day after tomorrow, in twenty years, the day of judgment. I do not know. - I get it. - Done. - As always, you're afraid to talk to her. Ué, well ?! Girl, let's rejoin the ranks! What would you like to insinuate? That your father isn't in charge at home? What am I under your mother? - "Succubus" is said. - How do you say? - Succubus. Don't make me laugh! It has always been said "succubus", .. .. as a child I said "succubus", everyone says "succubus". Now she changes the cards on the table! If you don't believe me, I'll show you in the dictionary. Succubus? - Marietta! &gt; Commands! - Take this stuff away. Succubus ... Succubus ... Succubus ... No. - What do you want? - Your name is "succubus", you? - No. - Then take the stuff away. Succubus ... It's not possible. Succubus ... Always. - "Succubus, succubus, succubus, succubus . - See? You're right. "Succubus, succubus, succubus, succubus. What do you want me to tell you? ln the post-war do not understand anything. These Americans changed everything! Anyway, know that I am not a slave to anyone! Rather, what shoes would you wear with these footpegs ? The boots, so at least they don't show. Oh yes? Is this the answer you give? A gentleman asks his daughter for advice and does the daughter answer like this? Gabriella, I demand respect! And for white hair .. ..and for your father's red-striped footpegs . Clear? Where are you going? &lt;Are you doing the offense now? This is nice! The daughter who takes a hat! Come here. Tell me: do you and this young man really love each other? Is it serious or is it a bad girl? Of course she is serious, very serious. - Then we'll have to tell your mother. - Mh mh. And you are under the illusion that she says yes? Well... Let's try. (screaming) I said no! No! Don't insist! Shame on you! (screaming) At your age! Where are we? (screaming) No! No! No! And when I said no, that's enough! (screaming) I'm in charge of this house! One two Three! "What are we at the tavern?" What are we at the tavern? In short, can you know what happened? - This unconscious daughter of yours got engaged. - With who? With a man. And worse is that he also wants to marry. - But with whom? - With the same man. You'll see, he's a good guy. She is a surveyor. Surveyor or not I don't care! You did terrible! - Instead he did very well! - I say no! - I say yes! - And take off this horror of tie. - Horror of tie? An equine tie with the head of Nearchus? Award at the Capannelle! But I say .... Don't listen to this brute of your father. He does not know how to choose ties, .. ... let's imagine your daughter's boyfriend! Come with mom. Tell me: where did you meet this guy? [Meanwhile, in the young man's house, ..] [..Everything seemed peaceful. It seemed...] Now daddy shows you how he solves your situation. Sorry, Teresa. Stand up with the nose, which is an assortment in here .. ..that you can't even find it at La Rinascente. I tell you. Look here. Look. Listen, Teresa, how do you think coats are going this year .. ..for a girl of this age? - Well ... - Solid color? - No, no. Fantasy. - Fantasy... Now we find the fantasy. Here is everything one wants. This is gray flannel, .. ..this is a gabardine. Here, here. Look at this little square. Can you find something more imaginative than this? Do you remember where I bought it? A via Nazionale, before the war. An opportunity. - Oh, it's still new. - You never wore it. - Never! I was ashamed as a thief, but it must be okay with you. Look. It is a feminine fabric, it can be said. - So, look ... - Hi. - Hello. There would be no need to squeeze it, they must be flared. Just shorten the sleeves and put on a belt, .. ..a curl all around, so ... Shall we give the old coat to the concierge's daughter? With the old coat comes a vest for me. Jokes? Now they're back in fashion. &lt;Giuseppe: We learned everything. Your mother told me everything. - Ah. What do you say? - I say that .... Sorry, huh. At 19 you shouldn't think about certain nonsense. Because? Does it take a minimum age to get married? No! But it takes a little common sense. Getting married at 19! Already one shouldn't get married even at 40! - How old were you when you got married? - 20 completed. - So why did you get married? - Because I was stupid. - Couldn't I be too? - In a small family .. ..one enough and advances. So, let's not talk about it anymore. - So, the one there with a beautiful ... - You mortified him. That's like a creature. Let me do it. See, my child, you must let yourself be advised .. ..by those who understand a little more than you, .. .. because marriage is not a game .. ..and you can't marry the first girl you meet. - Gabriella is not the first! - Luckily! We would be cool, .. .. because you talk about marriage since elementary school! Do you remember when you fell in love with the teacher? Dad, you can't understand, you're from another generation! Already! I am of the generation of those who understand nothing. Look, kid, I have a cursed habit of smoking, unfortunately. I do everything I can to get rid of this habit. I even manage to hide my cigarettes. Why don't you do the same? Why don't you young people get rid of the vice of marriage? - It's a matter of will, believe me. One says no! - What kind of talk! I don't see the relationship between smoking and marriage. If you allow me, I will try to show you the relationship that exists. I do not understand anything,.. ..you are intelligent, you will understand immediately. Do you think I wouldn't like to smoke more? Wouldn't you like to make your sister one more coat? But the family budget has its limits .. .. beyond which you can not go. We made many sacrifices, without reproach, to make you study .. ..and get you to take this piece of paper. And now that you've got it, you could take some money home, .. .." I am getting married" . Family is like a double entry: .. give and take, income and expenses. We have always given. We've been giving for 18 years and now you're going out? - I do not understand. - Ah! - Be calm. - Thank god. - My salary will not fail you. - Thank god. - I'd rather give up getting married. - Good good. So we think. - Where are you going now? - From Gabriella. - But then .... - I'm going to tell you that nothing more is done. - You have a right to know, right? - Right right. But politely. (GIUSEPPE BOFONCHIA) He could also telephone, though. Ouch! In this house the drawing pins are wasted. (screaming) Teresa! [On the other front, meanwhile, ..] [.. unaware of what had happened in Carlo's house, ..] [.. he was waiting calmly and with dignity ..] [..the official visit of the betrothed.] Dad, you are eating all the pastries. - All right, huh? - It's all OK? Very well. No! No! Dear aunts, no. You get up and disappear. - Because? - Because? - If he sees you, .. .. he gets scared and nothing is done. - But how? - It's an order! - Don't get angry! Dad, as usual, shut up, it's better. And you, that décolleté, is too much. - I'm fine like that. - Forget it. Do you, rather, remember the speech you have to make to Carlo? - My dear, I don't have the brains here. - I've known for a long time. As? I don't have a brain, but a record! Then make the agreements well: a long period of engagement, .. ..one year, maybe two. This is the most important condition. We do 2 years with the conditional. (BELL) Go ! Hide! - And where? - Under the bed, anywhere. Street! Street! No, dear, you too. Street! Street! Up! What are you doing standing there? Go open the door, goose! Is it possible that I have to manage everything myself? &lt;Antonio: Come on! - Good morning Dad. - Good morning. Come on! Don't get compliments, son. Don't be so shy. Come! Come! What the hell! I don't eat it, you know? I don't eat it. - Carlo is not coming. - Carlo ... - Carlo is not coming. - He does not come?! How do you do? We made the pastas, the vermouth, the refreshments. - (screaming) Did you hear? He does not come. - What happened? &lt;Antonio: That's true. What happened? We have rethought it. It's early, it's premature. In short, we have decided to continue as before. - What do you mean as before? - What do you mean, huh? - Like this, without obligation. - What a shame! And we send you around, with one, like this, without obligation? &lt;Antonio: God forbid! It takes a commitment! It would be too convenient! One commits himself, does he die at his convenience? No! Please realize that he never said anything to you. - Sorry. - Gabriella, why? You can tell me. What happened? - His father said no. - Your father said no? Did your father allow himself to say no ?! And the wife listened to him? Some men are born with a shirt. Look what a thing, this .... Always, it always happens to me like this. - What are you looking for? - The cigarettes! I never remember where I hid them. - I'm in the living room behind the radio. - Oh yeah! You are right. - But you shouldn't have told me. - If you smoke, it hurts you. If you don't smoke, you get nervous and it hurts you more. Do you think I should smoke? In my opinion, you should quit smoking .. ..without becoming neurasthenic. You ask me the impossible! It's a word! At my age! For charity! Fortunately, you see, I don't have any matches. Therefore .... - Has mail arrived? - No, I found it over there. - Do you want to listen to? - If you can. - "My darling .... - I understand. ".... I still can't understand how my father .. .. could deny me his consent. But we shouldn't read Carlo's letters. - Anyway, as parents ... Go on. - Listen here. "My father's attitude is absurd. Instead it is logical. "Stuff worthy of a hundred years ago. My darling, .... Another time? ".... my heart is broken, I have no more tears. Feel how ridiculous these young people today are! It seems copied from scratch from "The Gallant Secretary". "I feel disappointed and humiliated .... Humiliated with the "G". Humiliated with the "G" ?! With the money spent on him studying? "But knowing my father, I must also recognize .. ..that he was consistent with himself .... - Thank goodness! ".... because he is stubborn, an egoist with a dull mind .. .. unable to understand a feeling as beautiful as ours. Do I have a dull mind? Let me go and tell your son a little thing? - No! Where are you going? Joseph! - Permit? Humiliated! Now yes! - Here! - You did wrong! - No, I did well! Thus he learns to have respect for those who brought him into the world. I would never have allowed myself to say such a thing. - Instead you allowed yourself. - I? - The letter is yours. - You wrote it to me on May 12, 1939. - Sorry. - You know, I was a kid then! - The age of Carlo. And since your father didn't give consent, you wanted to kidnap me. Do not you remember? You came to my house with a large bouquet of roses. Yes, yes, I remember ... Well... But you could have told me that this was my letter. - Nice handwriting, apart from the "G". - Chiara. Now, sorry. Damn, you could have told me. &lt;Giuseppe: Don't be afraid. Indeed, I came to ask you .. ..the matches! Give me the matches, please. Thanks. I say, I ask you for matches and you give them to me right away? Is this the right way to help me quit smoking? Then give them back to me! Look, listen, Carletto, let's be clear. Sorry. - You say yes too hastily. - What do you mean? In other words, your obedience is very annoying, in short. - You must be a man. - You always say I'm a kid! Even kids have to be men! I understand obeying parents is right, okay. But a young man, even a child, must feel a personality. It must have a charge, so to speak, of independence. Yesterday, for example, you were making fire and flames .... - By the way, give me the matches. - No. - Of course? - No! No! - Oh well! Quite right! Good boy! I like you like that! Personality, independence. We said ... You were making fire and flames for that little girl .. .. and now, as if nothing had happened, scribble on the paper. These are not scribbles, they are orthogonal projections. If they are orthogonal projections, I don't argue. Anyway, a young man, when he wants something, .. ..bisogna the claims, that the demands .. ..that at the cost of annoying, you get it! I, for example, in a moment of fatigue .. .. I could also give in, say yes. Do you understand? - Yes, yes, dad. - Here, exactly. I understand, but I thought this is not wedding time. - I'm the one who thinks about these things. - But I screwed everything up. So? Without authorization? Who authorized you? - You! - Did I authorize you? But you are such a kid. Instead you have to be a man! But co - Look, .. .. now you .... Look, I'll tell you something: ..I demand, as a parent, and I don't want arguments, .. ..to give my wedding consent to this wedding that must be done. So, go to the phone, ask for an appointment .. ..and you present yourself with a beautiful bouquet of roses. Roses ... Roses, who knows how much they cost. Carnations. Not much. You make him give an enlarged by the florist .. ..and ask for the hand. I got it? - But I.... I don't argue with a bachelor! Forward! March! - Smoke, dad! - Thanks. Damn ... Well no! Ah! Damn! But this puts them everywhere, the pins! (screaming) Teresa! Come on here. Fresh fresh. - I'll take a cannoli. - Do your convenience. &lt;Angela: Knight? - What's up? &lt;Angela: He's wanted on the phone. - I'll come right away. - Who is it? &lt;Angela: Your daughter, Knight. - Gabriella! - Hello, dad! Come on up now! Carlo called and he is coming to talk to you. - Yes, immediately. - But today is Tuesday. Come " embè"? The proverb says: "Neither from Venus nor from Mars nor does one marry or leave". Which hand does he come to ask? Ah! Your hand? Yes I understand. First he makes us wait half a day, then all of a sudden ... But come quickly! Yes, I'll come up right away. - How much it is? - Sit down at the cashier. - How much does the gentleman pay? - 350 lire. - But I ate one. - Yes, with the left hand. But with the right he swallowed 9. He will understand, it is the sum that makes the total. Please. Oh yeah! I have to go up. (BELL) &gt; Antonio: Stop everyone! And he! Soon! Soon! (Shattered shards) &gt; Antonio: Damn! &gt; Take these pieces! Immediately! &gt; What are you doing impaled? Go open the door! The shards! - Good morning. &lt;Carlo: Good morning. - Please, take a seat. - Thanks. Please, take a seat. Forward! - Good morning. - Good morning. Please, take a seat. - Here. - Why did you want to bother? Thanks, it's very kind of you. If you allow, I spare. - Thanks. - You are welcome. What are you doing? Close the door. Get out! Come on, take a seat. So, as you well know, I am Mr. Cocozza Cavalier Antonio .. ..of the award-winning patisserie of the same name. And she? - Me Carlo D'Amore. - Carlo D'Amore? Wow! (laughing) This surname is all a program. - What do you say, Mom? - Mah! Only one elbow is seen. Wait a moment. Sorry. Excuse me, move a little to your right. Here, turn around like this. I'll tell you why later. Smile! Stop! - How nice! - Oh yes? Done! It was out of focus. I'll tell you, the aunts, on the other side, are spying through the keyhole .. ..to get to know her. Do you know how it is? They are female curiosities. Bravo, bravo, bravo! So, young man, as the girl's parent and father, .. ..I have to ask you some questions to get to know you. - Say, say. - I say: atta. Thing? - Say. - What? - She wanted to meet me. - Yes. You interrupted me, understand? &lt;Antonio: Excuse me, huh. - Are you interested in politics? - No! - Good boy. - Are you a member of any party? - No! - Good boy. - Milita? - No! - Good boy. The answer is correct. Now I should ask you another question that is a bit important and serious. Don't make me raise my voice. Come in here. - Have you seen "La dolce vita"? - Yup! Did you like it? - Boh! To her? - Tell me if you liked it. - According to what point. - From your point. - Yes. - Bravo! My wife, on the other hand, says it's crap. And I agree. What I am about to tell you is a very serious thing. It has its importance, I would say, its gravity! Severity! It's clear? But you don't have to interrupt me, because I have it all here. And if he interrupts me, I'm screwed. So ... Yes. The step you are about to take is not an easy step, .. ..it is not an easy step, especially since there are two of you. - In two! So it's a double step. - Yes. - Ergo, .. .. looking out on this mountain balustrade .. ..at the vertex of the top, it says: ..but all that light is gold. "Does that seem to you, dear?" "Yes, it seems to me." "So we want to take this downhill journey", .. "... which is easier together?" - Knight! Because the sum is the total, dear friend. Therefore... - What did that mean? - We'd like to get married in a month and a half. - Will you be free? - How "free"? What, am I a taxi? Free? Of course I'm free! Because? Because I came to talk about marriage. So, in a hurry? On two feet? But this is a marriage between telegraphers, dear friend! Do you know that in America, they first get married and then warn their parents? - In America? - Yes. - These Americans combine all the colors! I am a traditionalist and I wanted to warn you first. Thank you and I am grateful, but I was expecting .. .. a speech of clean feelings. I had to make a speech, .. ..but it didn't let me finish. It doesn't matter. I don't pick it up anymore. Traditionalist, he's fine. So, come on, the traditionalist has arrived! This is the mole. My wife. My daughter, you already know her. Aunt Adelaide, Aunt Carlotta, the grandfather, they don't matter. Here are the pastas, vermouth, etc. etc. Binge! Well ... Great! Very good! I put it, as they say, under the press, I crushed it. You modestly have a terrible husband. They get married in 2 months. - 2 months?! - Yes. Are you free? - But we said 2 years! Oh, how you see you haven't been to America! [Thus the day came when the two families ..] [... they had to get to know each other.] [It was decided to meet on neutral ground:] [..a trattoria out of town, at noon exactly.] [Gabriella, with commendable tact, it must be said, ..] [ .. she managed to convince dad not to come by car ..] [.. so as not to make the D'A more family uncomfortable , ..] [.. less wealthy, who surely would have arrived by bus.] [What does he do instead? Arrive by car, ..] [... just so as not to feel uncomfortable in front of the rich Cocozza.] [A rented car, of course. He hadn't bought it.] [What I have to say? It looked like noon of fire!] (GROWING MUSIC) Accountant Giuseppe D'A more. Cocozza Cavalier Antonio, from the award-winning patisserie of the same name. &lt;Antonio: This way. - Matilde: Grandfather, you there. - Grandpa, come on! - Matilde: Auntie, she is here next to me. - Ah, thanks. Listen, will it be up to them or us to pay ? I don't know, but I think it's up to the boyfriend's father. On purpose this has brought his grandfather, his aunts ... - But as a practice .... - Do the gentlemen want to order? - Yup. - Four broths for us. - Four broths! Accountant! But how? Do we come to the countryside and take the broths? - You know, we ate a lot last night . - I know.... &lt;Matilde: Antonio? - Yup? &lt;Are you coming? - Immediately. Permission. Four broths. Let's take four broths. - Are you really sure? - I wouldn't put my hand on the fire. It's been a long time since the wedding. You go and sit down, I ask. I'll go for a moment .... &lt;Matilde: Mrs. Teresa! - Teresa: Yes, where should I put myself? Excuse me, I would like to ask you for information: ..when there are engagement dinners , who pays? The father of the boyfriend or girlfriend? I never ask if his or her father pays. - Are you married? - Yup. - When you got engaged, did you have the engagement dinner? - Sure. - And who paid? - My father. - Sure? - Yup. So, when you bring the bill, you take it to that basset .. ..with the mouse-tailed mustache, do you understand? - Yup. - Thanks a lot. Good morning. - Good morning. - Accountant, at the table! - Immediately! - Well, lady? - All in order! - Good. - I'll take the agnolotti. - Agnolotti for me too. - Waiter. - Four broths? - No, what broths! Four fettuccine with butter, sauce, cheese and chicken giblets. - Calm down. - Have you changed your mind? - You know, I moved, the countryside ... - I was right! - A double. - A double! - With this wine .... - Yes. - .... that every duol cancels, .. ..toast to the health of Carlo and Gabriella! (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) Antonio: Good accountant! - Pergola wine! - No, no, no! Sit down! - But let me tell you! - But no! - Come on, say Wrong goes, straight veins! (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) - Accountant, if you allow .... - Yes? We want to seclude the two of us to lay out the marriage bases? - Good! Very good idea! - With permission, ma'am. - Antonio? - What's up? - I recommend it. - Don't worry. S'accomodi. - Her first, her first. Done. - Thanks. My dear accountant, while the boys think about love, .... - Lucky them! - .... we have to think about the most serious things. - In their interest. - Quite right. - It's true? - Sure. - So, I wanted to tell you .... - Yes? - What ... - I don't remember where I saw her. Excuse me, it scared me, I thought you felt bad. Naturally he must have seen me in Rome, somewhere. Rome is small. Tell me: have you ever been anywhere ? - I've been to many places. - And you don't remember the place? - What place? If she ... - The place where I saw her. - If you can't tell me ... - There are many places. One of those. - One of which? - Forget it. We fly over. - If not we go crazy. - Let's fly over. Accountant, I have prepared some notes to clarify many points. In this regard, I wrote down some kind of memo. - No! - Yup! - She too? - Of course! - Yeah, you're an accountant. - I didn't want to forget. Accountant is synonymous with reminder. We had the same telepathy. - Better to specify. - Better specify, yes. So, white wedding? - Of course and us in black. - In mourning? - No, in black ... - Has anyone died? - No, nobody. - He says in black, be patient. - I mean, a second-hand dress. Ah no! In this case, I do it again. - Sorry! My daughter is getting married! - He didn't understand. On the occasion of the wedding we wear a dark suit. - And she has it? - Yes. - Do you have this tic? Why it takes. - No, I don't have any tics. - No, I say, it takes a tic. A tic is needed for a wedding . - Ah, you mean the tight! - Tight? - Tight! What a funny name. We, in Naples, say the "sciammeria". You have to do a good job. - A friend tells him. - I have a blue dress. She says it's better to have a swarm. You have to do a good job. I'd gladly do it, but I don't want my wife .. .. say: "You spend too much". - We'll let them know later. - It is very expensive? - Listen to me, do the swarming first. - How much? - With 80, 90 thousand lire, fear passes. - An 80 thousand lire sham! - It's expensive? Come to my tailor. He will see that he will agree, everything will fall into place. For charity! For charity! For charity! Accountant! - I took it hard! - Yeah! - These days you have to be careful. - I took it hard! These temperature changes! (ANTONIO SNAKES) - Sorry! - You might be paying attention! Excuse me, be patient. Does he put the handkerchief in front of his mouth and take it off when he sneezes? - I got it on my mouth. - He splashed me all! - Sorry. - Forget it, I'll clean myself. - Take me here. - He caught me in the eye, sorry! Pay no attention to it. So, clothes, clothes, swarms, all right. Accountant, to simplify this I made a list: .. on the one hand what touches me, on the other hand what touches her. If you read it, then we're good to go. So, read my memo so it simplifies. It simplifies. Read a little - Here I already see a mistake. - Oh yes? - Travel. - You know, I wrote distracted. - See? - Yup! I wrote "I travel". No, the mistake is that he uploaded it to me, .. ..instead, the trip is your responsibility. - But sorry, you didn't read the rest. - The sequel? The wedding cake, the pastries, the cream puffs, the diplomats ... All production of the Cocozza pastry shop. - Accountant, these are all artifacts! - Okay, but I say .... - I put the other nonsense to you. - Do you call them "nonsense"? The honeymoon, the furniture, the apartment. - How many rooms? 4 or 5? - Neither 4 nor 5. - What if the grandchildren come? - But leave the grandchildren alone. - Why, do you foresee that ... - You want the truth? I predict badly. Yup? Are you perplexed? Won't you take it on him? - It's not to bother me. It is a matter of principle. - Oh yes? - Of course! - So, by its principle .. ..my daughter should end up in a furnished room. Your son doesn't take any girl . Take a Cocozza! And modestly we are known. We are familiar people, understand? Also for the dignity, for the morality of his son. If you see this guy walking around town, .. .. tomorrow, what do I know ... Enter a theater, a restaurant, .. ..with the Cocozza under your arm, it makes a good impression! - Let me tell you something. - Be patient. - No offense. - No offense. Precisely for the affair of this Cocozza I had some indecision. - How would that be? - You will allow! Is it a Cocozza surname? - Well? - In front of a blackberry D'A. - What do you have to say about Cocozza? - Never mind. You don't know how Cocozza is born! It was born well because I am an honest trader. - But I'm not a gardener! I do not know? Allows? - The gardener! - Sorry! - He's a gardener. - And you don't try to impose your points of view on me. Don't shout and don't raise your voice! I'm not a kid .. ..nor his succubus. - Succubus? (LAUGH) He said it! Succubus! - What I've said? - They say "succubus". - As? In any vocabulary. What kind of accountant is he? Read a dictionary, you will see that there is: succubus, succubus, succubus, succubus. - Understood? - I don't understand anything anymore. - What do you mean? With that face! - But how... Speaking of face, .. .. didn't she sell cigarettes on the corner of Via San Silvestro? Now do you mistake me for someone who owned a tobacconist? No, in times of war. With the box. I have his voice in the eardrums. - You cross the limits of education, understand? - Oh yes? We don't get anything done with this deal! - Can you teach me education? - Travel... &gt; Giuseppe: I'm not throwing a penny! - Me neighter! - What crazy speeches! - Nothing is done! Then he sneezes in my face! Is it like this? - Matilde: What happens? - Antonio: Nothing! It happens that the self-styled accountant does not want to chase a penny! - We want to impose a beggar wedding ! - Teresa, shall we go? I D'A more! D'A more ... D'A more you die of hunger. I do not collect. Guys, let's go. And should we get some people to marry our daughter? - Your daughter is not Princess Soraya. - What stuff! And some people have been employed at the Ministry for forty years .. ..with honor and reputation. - And I'm Knight. - It does not matter! - Knight! The crosses are obtained for a little money. It does not matter. I have the right .... - Mrs? What do you want? - Who should I give the bill to? - To the Sir. - No! - It's your turn. - It's your turn. According to practice, it's up to the girlfriend's father. - His practice is wrong. - Because? - Get information, read the papers. - There's nothing to read. - Read the Official Gazette. - What an Official Gazette! Would you like to keep, please? - Hundreds of banquets are held here. - With this? - With this? Mrs! - Say. When she got engaged , who paid for lunch? - From my father. - See? But isn't it the boyfriend's father's turn? Yes, but my fiance was a war orphan. He sees it? She is alive! He saw? (SNEAKS) Carlo: Gabriella! Gabriella! Has your father changed his mind? Did you talk to him? No, he doesn't give up. And yours? He says yours is a boor and he's got a cold. - Would you blame my father? - Basically yes. For yours, ours must be the wedding of the century! Don't shout like that! In that room they are doing exams. What exams! Recognize it: we are like this because of your parents! I don't recognize anything! (GABRIELLA CRIES) Gabriella, love, don't be like that. You will see that it will get better. We need to study something. It's useless. I know I'm out of luck. They all have it with me. - Did it go wrong? - Huh? - Did it go wrong? - Yup. - Are they very strict? - Very severe. - Imagine! I do not know anything. I will introduce myself in another session. Cerea! - Health, accountant. - Thanks. Forward. - Did you call me, Commander? - Come on, come on. Yup. (Sneezing) Please don't come near. - Sorry. - You're cold. - Yes, a friend attacked me. - Indeed, an enemy. - I don't care. Try not to attach it to me. So, I got one ... I received a tip to examine his progress. Excuse me, I took the liberty of urging. - Please take a seat. - Thanks. - Be careful! Don't blow me in the face! - Sorry. I have examined his record : nothing to complain. When did he get his last shot? (GIUSEPPE EMITS VERSES) - Sneezing on the other side. - No, I say, huh! In 1948. - 12 years ago. - Yup. - A lifetime. - As? - I mean, a lifetime. I understand, there would be seniority. This is an important shot: .. change of category. Are you sure you deserve it? Is everything in order? Whether in the office or at home? - Well, you have a wife. - Yes, an old-fashioned woman, good, holy woman. - A thirteen year old daughter. - Yes, the little girl is also good. - He is in the second quarter and already has an average of 8. - Brava! (breathing hard) An old-fashioned little girl. - And a boy of twenty. - Graduated surveyor. Obedient, respectful, good. (breathing hard) He's not like those modern kids. - He's not a Teddy ... Teddy ... - Is his name Teddy? No, said Teddy Bo - (SNEAK) Take care! What's up? Forward! &lt;La Sarda: Come on! What's up? An urgent communication for the accountant. Urgent? Come on, tell him and go. - Thanks. Say. - Your wife called. - Oh yes? - She was so agitated ... - Agitated? He said to run home immediately .. ..because your son ran off with a woman. - Ah! - Sneezing! Sneezing! - No, I mean, do you hear? Do not worry! He will have escaped old- fashioned , in a wheelchair! - Go, D'A more! - Excuse me. - Go! Go, I said! Go away! (Sneezing) - Health. &lt;Thanks. (OLD) But I say, .. ..but what, are you locked up in a prison, are you escaping? And then he leaves the note, like the Count of Montecristo. Don't dramatize! He did not enlist in the Foreign Legion. You make me laugh! What if he actually went to the Foreign Legion? What do you say? Carlo ran off with Gabriella. - Embè? - Women don't get them in the Foreign Legion. - Besides, it's your fault. You pushed him to this header. - I? - I? - Yes you! Cry it's better. (SNEEZE) What are you crying? That's the damn thing that hit me with a cold. - I wanted to save him from the Cocozza. - Poor guys ... Poor him, not her. She is a dead cat. She must have organized the kidnapping to get our consent. - I know these Lolitas! - But where did you meet them? - Who? - The Lolitas! - But who knows them? I know them, the Lolitas of the novel ... (CAMPANELLO) This must be him. 'I am rascal! God thank you. - Yes, thank God. - Yes. I'll be inflexible. - One moment. - What's up? - Carlo has the key. Oh yeah! The girl is at school. So who is it? And who can it be? Police? The Red Cross? - Oh God! You go to open. - I? No, you go. - You are inflexible. - Here, yes. You don't have the courage to open the door. Go open it, please. I am the father, I cannot .... Gabriella! Where is my daughter? - Here it is! Rascal! Scoundrel! - What does he do? Antonio, leave him! (screaming) Joseph, leave him, you hurt him! But how?! Is this choking me and am I hurting him? I sue her for kidnapping of minors and then I break her head! I first smash her head .. ..and then I denounce her for trespassing! - To me? - Yup! Gabriella! Gabriella! - What are you doing? Where you go? - Where is Gabriella? - Antonio, you're not at home! - No, ma'am, let him. Her husband is crazy. What's he got into his head? What are you looking for? Come outside! Where are the other rooms? - There aren't any others. - Is that all there is? And you call this "home"? This is an abode, it is a tunnel, it is an apricot. It will be a tunnel, but this is a decent house, understand? We know these decent houses! We do not offend! What does it imply? I mean it's so decent that your son ran away .... - Instigated by his daughter! - (screaming) Enough! Instead of arguing, we do something to find them. - They will not have committed nonsense! - Yeah! - But no! They are serious people! - Their? - Madam, would you like something? - Yes thanks. I am shocked. - A vermouth. She too? - Yes. - Not him! - Because? - Stop that! - Because the cold attacked me. I know that son of a dog of his son .. ..where he took my daughter. - What does he say? In a furnished room to take advantage of her! - But I say, but .... - Your son is a tricher! If my son is a walrus, his daughter is a seal. Here! - As? - If my son is a walrus .... But what did he understand? I told him in French. Accountant! - Lei vuol say "cheater". - Cheater. - So you know what your daughter is? A nymphet! - Joseph! - Mind how he talks! - Oh yeah! We, at home, are all in good health. My daughter does not ninfect anyone! (PHONE RING) - It must be Carlo. - Phone! - Did they knock? No, it's Carlo! This is Carlo! - Ready! - Sorry. Ready! - Sorry. Ready! - Ah! He is her son. - Give it here. - Call to blackmail me. How much it is? Tell me how much it is! Mr. Cocozza, don't talk nonsense. We didn't want to be forced into this, .. ..but it's the only thing we have to do. - And it's his fault and my father's! - Not mine! Only your father's! But what does it say? Carlo, where are you calling from? Carlo, what is this nonsense? Carlo, come back! Carlo, tell Gabriella to come back. Carlo, you run away and get Gabriella back. No! Carlo! Make Gabriella escape and you come back! What an escape! Nobody escapes here! - Is it true you didn't run away? - Not yet,.. ..but we are at the station and we are about to leave. - I'm at the station! - At the station? But where do you want to go? Carlo! I forbid you to leave! - Get a taxi and come home! - Speak too! - Will you, accountant? - Wait up. - Now I'll talk to you! Ready? - Talk to us! - Here! - Hello? Gabriella, is that you? And Gabriella! Here is your father's voice speaking. Please, I beg you, I beg you! - Not leave! Not leave! - Do not recommend it, impose it on him! - I'll force it! - No, it's too late. - Let's go and get married. - Yup. Hi, the train is about to leave. (WHISTLE OF STEAM) Oh God! A whistle! A hiss! The train did sst! Part! No! Make it stop! Stop that train! Stokers! Machinists! Men of toil! A porter! Call the stationmaster! - Tell him he's fine, let's not argue. - We'll do as they say. - And she? - I do what you others do. - Don't you say it? - Who should I tell? - Will you tell the stationmaster ?! - I called him, he's not coming. What a stationmaster! Tell the kids we're capitulating! - We do what they want. - Guys, we capitulate! Come? (screaming) Gabriella! The train is leaving. (screaming) Gabriella! Call me Gabriella! (screaming) There will be, in some tail car! - Dad says he'll fix everything. We have it checked! - Yup? Okay, dad. Let's go right back. But yes, now. We are in the dairy near the house. - Then? - What are they doing? - That say? No! Under these conditions, no! This means taking advantage of it! - I got it? Lovebirds blackmail us. - What do they want? I wo n't give you the 5-room apartment ! But wait! We must not become so rigid in such a tragic moment! - The 5-room apartment? - Discuss something ... .. on which the fate of our children depends ! The train is leaving! If you're so stingy, I'll kick the apartment out! - Tell him! Give me here! - With two bathrooms? - Yup! - Two bathrooms! - And terrace! - Give me your hand! Can I tell you? - Hurry up! Ready? Therefore, the accountant, according to his magnanimity, .. .. in front of four witnesses .... - What does a trial do? - .... he said that the apartment from him. - Here. So don't leave, come back now. All right. To soon. Are you happy now? I did everything she wanted. I have carried out his last wishes. She gets what she wants! She is self employed! (ANTONIO RIDE) You are a Duce! Dux! Duke! - Teresa: Can we hug? - Yup! - Antonio: Here we are. - You too can hug. - You're related now. - One moment. - With that cold! - But she attacked me. But I am healed. His is in place. He is in service activity. (Sneezing) - Health. - Thanks. - Here. A miracle pill. - Oh yes? Is it good? - How not! This should not be swallowed, it should be sucked lightly. - What brand are they? - These? Cocozza mints! I make them with my hands. So, look. - And I roll the ball. - How disgusting! - As? - As? Makes me put this shit in my mouth? - Junk? - Eh, sorry! A proposed junk ... But she's not that .. ..who collected rubbish on behalf of the Holy Family , huh? (DOOR OPENS) &gt; Giuseppe: It can't be them! &gt; Antonio: It's not possible! &gt; Giuseppe: Oh no! - Antonio: Gabriella! - Mom! Antonio: Finally! Wait a minute, you guys were calling from the station? - Yes. - Embè? - And in five minutes you have already arrived? Accountant, in this atomic age you are looking for certain things ... They invented reactors, missiles, streamers, .. ..metropolitane .... - One moment. There is something wrong. You want to procrastinate. No, dear accountant. He promised with four witnesses that he was interested .. ..to buy the house for the boys: 5 rooms, two bathrooms .... (SNEAKING) - Cheers! - Thanks. Health! You do not talk anymore! [The accountant Giuseppe D'A more had gotten into a lot of trouble, you know?] [Since his income did not allow him ..] [..the purchase of an apartment, he had managed to fit in ..] [.. among the members of a cooperative of his Ministry.] [The houses of the cooperative, as we know, have all the advantages, ..] [... less that of being built in central areas.] [This, in fact, was located at the twentieth km after Ciampino.] [Well, sure, a little peripheral area.] [But according to what Carlo's father assured , ..] [.. in a hundred years from now, the countryside would rejoin the city.] &lt;Giuseppe: Come, come, Knight. (PLANE TURN) What engine, huh? - English DDL! - This? - Go to London. - And come through here? - We're close to the airport. - Close? We are inside the airport! - Exactly, I say. And this, according to her, would be the quiet neighborhood, .. ..quiet, of great future and great development? - What do we know what the future holds? - Oh yes? - Here we go? - Just one thing, accountant. If your son were to buy a car .... - Let's start over? - .... which I don't believe in, .. .. it should be registered in Naples. In moments we are there. - Do you feel the sea air? - Don't make me laugh! Shall we go up, please? - Antonio: Young man! - Say. - Where do you take the elevator? - There is no elevator. - It's a coop house - - Forget it. I explain. This is built with a modern American criterion : ..without a lift, because health is in motion. Movement! Up! Down! - Motion avoids heart attack. - It's natural! - I get it. - This is the main staircase. - So gross? - Then it's changed. They also wanted the elevator in a co-op house! - Antonio: How is the manutengolo? - This is changed, all marble! Antonio: It will be! - Giuseppe: Innocent devices! - Antonio: They don't hurt anyone. Accountant! You pant, huh? Handle! - What, sorry? - He's panting. Do you see what it means to go on foot? Because I live in an old house, with the elevator ... (PLANE RUMBLE) Accountant, and where is this going? It comes from london. It's the same device. - Didn't it stop? - Same type. - One goes and the other comes. - And they all pass on the terrace? - They follow the same route. - The same ... - Route. Accountant, this is the same break. - I mean , Knight ... - You're welcome, I was referring to eardrums. - We want to go? - Speaking of eardrums, .. .. accountant, tell me the truth. - What? Didn't you play the trombone in the main Tivoli band? (ANTONIO laughs) Here, I got it right! Look, I 've never been to Tivoli . - Oh no? - No. - Then I got confused. I was confused with the Frascati dog catcher. - Yes, yes, now I remember! Yes, yes! - I have never caught dogs! - Really? - All right? - And I believe it, of course! The dogs, as soon as they saw her, left! Running! (RIDE) - Well, I say .... - Well, what? - We want to see this apartment? - And let's see it. Don't trade me with anyone anymore, please. - You're a chaplain! - Leave these speeches alone. - Look, here it is. - However! Yup! As an entrance, it's not bad. A nice, spacious, wide entrance. - One moment, sorry. - Where's the rest of the apartment? - There is not . - How is it not there? This is not specifically the entrance. This is a rationally built house. ..and the smallest space must be saved , to the centimeter. - Oh yes? - Yes. This is the total for the apartment. - This? - This! Don't be impressed, I'll explain immediately. - Total? - These are the layouts of the environments to be built. - These bricks? - Yes. There is the entrance, .. ..there is room to pass when you go to the bedroom. - Is this the bedroom? - For newlyweds. - Where am I now? - In the bathroom. - In the bathroom, dressed, no. - Step into the lounge. - Step. - This is all representation. - And Snow White, where do we put it? - Snow-white? Already. Because the Seven Dwarfs can find suitable accommodation. But Snow White? He must have seen her, she's a piece of big girl! She always likes to joke! If you knew how much this apartment costs me , .. .. would not want to. - Accountant, what is this vain? Here there are two counters so you don't see what's behind it. - Is it a built-in wardrobe? - It's a kitchen, American type. (laughing) But please me! A kitchen this! Sorry. For payments, how did it go? Wouldn't it seem like you should give me a hand? No, I'm on the terms. These are payments that fall to you. ..as father of the groom. Be patient! - You pay me all these! - I pay what I get! &lt;Giuseppe: You know what I mean. - Stand still! Don't dust me .. ..that my raincoat is worth something! - And mine isn't it? - What do you want it to be? It's a pelecchia! - A pelecchia? - Rather. - What? - Tell me, is this house solid? Because? Is it a fake house? I take care of it because my daughter has to live here ! - And my son not? - What do I care? - How would that be? I look after my daughter's interests because I am the father! - I'm not my son's father? - Who knows! - How, who knows? - Who knows how he used it. - I got used to mine well. - And mine, how did I get used to it? I do not know? Was I in your house? When he talks to me, watch with your hands and knock down the hammer. - And you keep your finger down. - Do you want to put the hammer with your finger? - Do you want to put your finger with the hammer? - Cocozza ... - Call me "Knight". - Look, Ca - Co - Ca - Let's not start with bad words! Let's not start with bad words! In short, Cavalier Cocozza, if the house suits you, the hatchet, .. ..if not we go and we don't talk about it anymore! - I have to test. - And test! - Move away! - Do you feel it? - What? - Is this a brick sound? - What do you need, the music box inside? - Can't you hear it? - What? - He's stupid! - Let's start with the offenses? - The brick is cracked! The sound! - Look ... - Do you understand? And don't fret. - I'll look there later. - I can not take it anymore. - He sees it? - What? - He sees it? - What? - As soon as I touch it, the plaster falls! - And she picks the wall! - What is it, travertine? - But look who I have to relate to! - In conclusion! - Do me a favor. - What do you want to do? - What is that? - Wet, water. - How wet? It's the plaster done this morning. It will have to dry again. - Hasn't it dried yet? - Do you ask me? - Do you want me to know? - What are you looking for? - That I am a bricklayer? - What are you saying? - Keep your hands off! - What ... &lt;Giuseppe: What are you doing? But what.... (screaming) What are you doing ?! Crazy! Maniac! Destroyer! If he puts his hand in, it blocks my hole and stops the water! - Why do you want water? - I have to check, right? - What do you want to check! - The water pipe! - I need to check .... - What the .... Moisture, pipes! The water is wet! My Madonna! But what had to happen to me! - Do you know what I tell you? - Yup. My daughter will not set foot here! - He'll never come home! - Sure! I said it first! (PLANE TURN) I said it first! This marriage will never happen again. - Teresa! &gt; Teresa: Did you like the house? - Of course! Come a moment! &gt; I can't. I have the stuff on fire. - Just a minute. &gt; But what happened? Now I'll explain it to you. I blow everything! &gt; Teresa: What did you say? - One moment! Regolini Typography? Do I really speak to the owner? Listen to me well. All right, accountant D'A more. As you want. Good morning. - So, how many do we do? 500? - Nothing, suspended, canceled. For many times with the laughing girls and boys.. ..played I along the road and over the hills.. ..when the sun was low and the air was cool,.. ..stopping to club the walnut tree standing leafless.... Miss! Young man! If you want to talk, you can get out! (LAUGHTER) &lt;We can work alone! &lt; Quite, please! Quite, please. Now the smell of the autumn smoke and the dropping acorns.... Are there any news? What does your father say? That because of Attila we gambled the apartment. - Attila would be my father, right? - And who else? Did you know that the damage bill to the construction site arrived today ? How full are the boxes of all this! - Even vulgar now! - I'm sorry, but I'm nervous. It's my father who makes my life impossible. (sighing) Are you telling me? Today I answered him badly. - Permit? Did you answer him wrong? - What are you interested in? And do you know what he did? He slapped me. Even the slaps? But I'm changing school! Cerea. Maybe they repented. I know my father well, he would give in if yours apologized. Eh, thanks! Carlo, listen! Each wants the other to apologize. So? You are right! - Did he come here? - His wife assured me . He comes to apologize. I, the apologies, I get them at my house from 17:00 to 20:00, not later! Coming home was getting too low. You don't have to rage like that, do you think? But I don't rage. It is enough for me that he humbly apologizes. We were wrong to come here. It was he who had to bend .. ..and come to our house to apologize. Leave them a shred of dignity ! This is a public venue, neutral ground. Here we go! - Knight ... - Good morning, ma'am. - Good morning. - Good morning. I think the best, .. ..if you have something to say, maybe it is to get away. - As you want. - As you want. - Do you want to get away? It's not that he wants me to get away. Tell her where you want it to take place. - Let's go to the lab. - Laboratory. - Please, take a seat. - Giuseppe: Excuse me. - Matilde: You're welcome. Excuse me. - Do I have it sent cash on delivery? - Sure. What are you waiting for? - All right. Presto! Come on, take a seat. - The meeting in Teano begins. - May the Lord send us good. - Are there many unbreakable items? - Unfortunately ... Take a seat, ma'am. - It's very hot in here, isn't it? - Yes, they are ovens. But it's a dry heat. It does not hurt. - A cannoli? - Huh? - A cannoli? No thanks. Unfortunately, sweet stuff, I have to stay away from it. - Is this a refusal? - No, it's not a waste. Except I'd break a diet, that's it. Break it! Break it! At least to taste them. To like, look. - You see, I'm acquiescent. - What's this? - Forget it. Accountant, you speak even with your mouth full. It's the same. Come si dice in francese? "For me it's the same thing". - Tell her. - No, you say. I listen. - No, if anything she says, if you allow. - No, it's her. Be patient. Now... - Are these Neapolitan pizzas? - Yes. - I'm not wrong, am I? Yes. She has never eaten them, I guess. - I ate them in Velletri, I think. - In Velletri? - Yup. - Where does Velletri stay? - From a peddler. - Oh yes. We export all over the world, even to America. - Every day, by plane. - You allow, right? - Come in. Accountant, it seems to me that you are taking it too far. - It's true? - I take it like this. - No, I mean, come on. - Not the pizzas. - Come on her! - No, say, say. These excuses? - Exactly! Face them! - If he's in awe, I turn around. - I make them? Does he turn around? - Yup. But here we're understanding whistles for fiasco. Have patience, I am waiting for your apologies. - Well no! There is a misunderstanding. - Oh yes? - Yup. Does that mean that I was lightly duped? - No, it's not my style, if you allow. - Yup? - Yeah! - Is this the case? - They are. So, accountant, take a seat at the cash desk: two pizzas and a cannolo. As? As? First of all, I'll put the pizza back here. - These lousy things ... - It was lousy even before. - He puts it in his pocket. - But allow? - Where did you put it? - In your pocket. - Forward. - Come here, listen .... One moment! Young men , go out and smoke a cigarette. - Sorry. - Come in. Look, Cocozza ... Accountant, don't put your hands in there. So ... Listen to me, accountant. You see, if you want you could put it in other terms .. ..and come ... eh? - Come to an agreement if you want. - Look, if you allow me, .. ... I will tell you that I have the impression that it does not go down ... - That he does not do anything. - Do you opine? - Opino. - Wow! Let me insist. - Please insist. I have 200 crates of Bulgarian eggs, sent to me from Monza, .. ..by sea. Clear? - At this point ... - Yes? .... I must make them observe, with much regret, .. ..that I really don't care . - Oh yes? - Yeah! - Coincidentally. Allow if I insist? - Please insist. With these crates, that is, with these Bulgarian eggs .. ..I make thousands and thousands of Easter doves, the Cocozza dove. I would like to point out again that I still don't care .. ..the so-called dried fig. - You mean that to me? - Yes. - Okay. But know that it would be enough .. ..that she put a little word to the Ministry for the supply .. ..and at Easter every employee would have his dove Cocozza. 3,000 employees, 3,000 Cocozze, huh? - Did you say 3,000 Cocozze? - Yup. - And why 3,000 Cocozze? - And how many if not? - All the cucuzzaro, if you allow. - I allow it. What, we're really playing the game .. ..that I'm going to the Ministry, do I put the word for Cocozza? - But look! But she is ... - Listen to me. - Look, I'm about to meet you. - So we think. - It's because I lose my balance. - Get up. - Get me up. - Get up, but listen to me sitting. - But how dare you? - Accountant, I dare because .... - Let's put a stone on it. - Let's put a stone on it. How does that beautiful Neapolitan song say ? Who had, had, had, who gave, gave, gave. - With this? - I'll give you an apology, okay? In return, however, she lets me have the Easter supply from the Ministry .. ..so that I use the Bulgarian eggs mentioned above. It's clear? You were very nice to sing that pacifying song. But he forgot to make the finalino. I'll do it, will you? - Zum zum, and we don't talk about it anymore. - No! - Don't get your hands on! - You mustn't get up! You must listen to me. With "zum zum" he prevents me from the second verse. - Continue it and do it quickly. - In addition to my humble apologies, .. .. I add the expenses for the honeymoon .. ..and refreshments for 150 people! I mean, 150 people, all things! Which, according to practice, would be up to her, would touch. - I continue with the "zum zum". - You are chronic with 'I'm "zum zum". - Sure, sorry! - So prevents me from telling you the final. Forward! Say it, but hurry up. I wear the stainless metal favors .. ..and confetti with shelled almonds , okay? No! I repeat my "zum zum". I prefer to pay .. .. what I have not even consumed, but let's not talk about it anymore. I prefer to pay everything .. ... rather than lending myself to his shady business. At most, if you really want to haggle, .. .. I'll make a counter-offer, okay? - Counter-propose! Forward. - I get down ... - No, get up, for heaven's sake. - Let me finish. - But God forbid! - I go down to apologize, .. ..it's the first time in my life that I've done it. I apologize, .. ..and she pays for a honeymoon and refreshments. No, no, no! Here is an erroneous fact. I apologize to him. No, because I came on purpose. I also ran. No! You get me the supplies from the Ministry and I apologize. - I'm in my house. - You pay everything and I apologize. - I came on purpose. - But I'm in my house! - Then? &gt; I left home .... - I'm sorry. - No, don't insist. - Sorry! Don't insist! I make excuses! &gt; Giuseppe: I asked for them louder! &gt; Antonio: humbly, on his knees, genuflected. - And I asked him before! - Why are you yelling like that? Nothing! Can't you hear us? We are apologizing. Please, I apologized to you. - No, I asked her first! - Well, no wedding! - (crying) Do you feel it? - As?! - Gabriella! - Gabriella! - Carlo! Don't run after her! - Well, enough! - Yup. - That's enough! - Yes. - I know the little word that should be said to you two. Thanks. - Gabriella! - Ugh! - Matilde! Matilde! - What's this little word? - I have no idea. - What are you doing? - What time is it? - 2:45 am. - Did you understand? I couldn't sleep. - What are you looking for? The cigarettes? - What cigarettes! The sleeping pill! I know what doesn't make you sleep. It must have been the potato omelette last night. - No! It is remorse. - The remorse of what? Of what can happen. So, if nothing happened, how can I feel remorse? - You must have come before. - Before what? - A lot of things can happen. - What is that? The newspaper reads "Lovers taking their own lives" every day . The newspaper also reads about those who win the lottery. - And we never have to. - Thanks! Whenever a fortune strikes you, you kick it. What's wrong? Someone must have that supply from the Ministry. Teresa, let's leave these speeches alone , for heaven's sake! We have always gone ahead with our strength. I will never let him have the supply to that pastry chef ! Because you don't care about your child's happiness. - This is blackmail talk. - No! No! No! That's advice, dear. You would do a pleasure that costs you nothing. He would bear all the expenses of the wedding. May! Oh God! Sorry. - I got three. They got stuck. - What are you doing? I am loving. To love. Let me see the tube. - But put your glasses on again! - Because? That's the sympamine that Carlo used to get when he was studying! - What a pill was enough to not sleep all night? - Yup. - You do not know? - Damn! Oh God! Where am I going now? Aho! [You know, the man prefers, but it's the wife who disposes.] [Mrs. Teresa managed to overcome her husband's resistance ..] [..with the most terrible of maternal weapons : the future of the child.] [And so the 3,000 Cocozze left for the Ministry .] [But here is Tuesday after Easter ..] [.. the accountant D'A more, returning to the office, ..] [... he found corridors, rooms, desks, all strangely empty.] "Go to the head office immediately . Accountant! How are you? But look what a pleasure! - Please, lower, lower! No! Don't let her down. - More than this. - Keep your voice down. - Ah! The voice! I would not like the commendatore to hear that we know each other. - We don't know each other. - No. - We don't know each other. - We've only just met. We don't know each other for him. - We don't know each other for him. - We're strangers. - Strangers. I understand, I understand. Then.... (MUTE BEAT) I don't understand her anymore. I did not say to speak with gestures but to lower your voice, .. ..but that he can hear me and not the commendatore. - Sorry. - You are welcome. - So, the head of the cabinet ... - It means the head of the cabinet . - The boss ... - Cabinet. - Oh yes? - Yup. Do you only have one in such a large building ? I'm talking about the head of the cabinet, Commendator La Sarda. - Ah! This Sardinian sent for me . - He called me too. - Oh yes? - Yes. - It will be to compliment her .. ..For the supply. - I do not know. And that, accountant, will serve you a lot for advancement. My promotion should be certain. In a few days the commendatore takes the file to the Minister. .. and I have to thank .... - God forbid! - Don't thank me. - What's she got to do with it? - I have to thank my seniority. - Oh yes. I recommend that to him. - As? - You're a little old. - I'm talking about my seniority at work! - However.... Won't you think you're a youngster - I take them well. - With cheese and pepper hair. - I tell you, but I, modestly, have dark ones. - A little tan! - Tintarella? - #Moon tan .... # - What tan? - # .... milk-colored tan. # - What are we doing? Songs? - # .... you become candid! # - You're the one pulling me, sorry. - What do I drag? We're not singing the songs. We want to go? - After ... - Yes? - I'll take her to my tailor to measure the tight. - You will see that it will fit her like a brush. - Agree. Speaking of brush, accountant, tell me the truth. - Tell me. - Didn't you, by chance, be a barber in Centocelle? I got it right! Ah, is that you? Both? Please make yourselves comfortable. - Thanks. - Good morning. - Please Please. Ragionier D'A more, do you know Cavalier Cocozza? - I don't have this pleasure. - Ragionier D'A more? - Yup? Do I know him? We actually agreed .... That is, I agreed with myself that I don't know him. - Do you know me to me? - No. I never have .... But I am happy to be able to see and know him personally. - Pleasure. - No, it's him. - Sorry. - So happy. Allows? Cocozza Cavalier Antonio, from the award-winning patisserie of the same name. Please make yourselves comfortable. &lt;You're welcome. - Where, sorry? &lt;There. - Disorder? - No, no. - If I disturb, I'll cut the rope. - No. Take a seat. - For delicacy. - Don't waste my time. - We pastry chefs are polite. - So, Cavalier Cocozza .. ..has made the supply of Easter doves to the Ministry. I shyly point out that I have not been paid. - We'll talk about it later. - I trust you, don't worry. Especially since the accountant has made himself a guarantor. Yes, he guaranteed for us, but also for her. So much so that it appears here that he supported the request. Yes, on this report, where does he praise .... Does he have a stiff neck? - A little uric acids. - Ah! Praise etc. etc. Because I realized that the product was good, .. .. exquisite, I would say. - Exquisite ?! This dove sucks! - How dare you? - I allow myself! - Allow me, but do you want to explain? - Very easy to explain. Half of the Ministry employees are sick at home. Don't make me laugh. It's the flu. - What an influence! Colic! - Alcoholic flu! But what alcohol! Scary colic! Scary alcoholic flu! Pharmacies, like this! The hospitals, all full! The cemeteries, sold out! No seats, not even to pay them a million! - But only those who have eaten this filth! - Filth? - Yup! But, sorry, Commander, you insist. Not only insists, but instigates. She slanders, she wants a lawsuit. Be patient. - Do you know what connoisseurs call this dove? - No. - The Sofia Loren of the doves! - But please me! - I'm doing you a favor. The tasting. - I was crazy! - Then you don't like Sophia Loren. A matter of taste. - You taste it. - I? - Yes. - God forbid! I am a confectioner, do I start to taste the sweets? If I tasted all the desserts I make .... Stay calm. &lt;Antonio: Let's have the accountant taste it . Here, accountant, you taste it. When he realized ... ..of the goodness of the product, have n't you tasted it? No. I had a great feeling, so, ad hoc, .. ..because I confess my weakness: ..things that get fat I avoid eating them. - This gets fat. Then realize now. You eat a piece. - Eat some! - Eat it yourself. &lt;La Sarda: Me? No. - Eat a piece. - Really me? - With employees who are sick? - Give him a slap. &lt;La Sarda: To whom? - A moral slap. &lt;Come on! - Up! - If you have the courage, eat a piece. - Hurry up! - You make me gain a pound. - Quintal more, quintal less! A quintal! - As? - What did I tell you? Sophia Loren! - How do you find it? - Bona. - What? - Sophia Loren. - I'm talking about the dove. - This also seems excellent to me. &lt;Antonio: Exquisite. - I advise you not to eat any more. - And why? - Now a kilo more, a kilo less, I eat this too. - There is no sound? - What should I hear, sorry? - But how do you feel? - I feel great. Just fine! (COMPLAINTS) - How do you feel, accountant? - Bad, bad, bad. - There are visits. - It is my wife? - No, two gentlemen. They will be two office colleagues. Let them in. - Please, don't get upset. - I'm not getting excited. I have snakes in here. What we become! A piece of man ... Well! A kind thought: two chrysanthemums. Done. Get this shit off me! I'm not dead! I'm fine, you know? (laughing) She's fine! Have you heard it? He declared it himself in front of two witnesses. The Italian Red Cross and Abbot Farina. All right, accountant D'A more, happy you! But I will send the invoice to you anyway. Permanently suspend these holdings. - They don't marry again this time either. - Alright then. [Commendator La Sarda, who was a good man, ..] [..invited the accountant D'A more to his house for an exceptional evening.] [Nobody could imagine which Machiavellous ..] [.. they knew how to combine two mothers ..] [..to obtain the happiness of their children.] - Giuseppe: Thanks for inviting us. - Please Please. Rather, did you still have ailments? No, those 5 days in the clinic were enough . I hope they have served to show you my good faith. We don't talk about it anymore. When does the broadcast air? - Soon. Just finished the movie. - Good! - Waiter: Angela! Come on, get started. - Excuse me. - Madam, come and watch TV. There is the Knight's daughter. - I come. - Knight, great satisfaction to see your daughter on video. - Yup. - Are you excited? - A little bit, a little bit, that's it. Ladies and gentlemen, good evening. In a few moments you can follow .. ..a new episode of the television investigation "Giovani d'oggi". &gt; Interviewer: Here's another interesting side tonight .. ..of our investigation into modern youth. &gt; Influence of the family on the behavior of today's children. &gt; They are angry, violent, discontented. &gt; But what do they want? &gt; What's your name? - Ermanno Tazzoli, .. .. called "the devil of Sunday", or "the exterminator of the servants". &gt; Ermanno, what is your impatience due to .. ..and this spirit of rebellion? Maybe your father neglects you? Look, doctor, this is NN's son. &gt; Here is a classic case in which parental behavior .. .. has a negative effect .. ..on the formation of the young man's character. &gt; Interviewer: Hey! You two! - He is my son. - But how did it combine? &gt; Why didn't you go to school this morning? She didn't feel like it .. ..and I don't go there anymore because I graduated. &gt; Then your father will be happy with you. - My father? He doesn't care! - But I mean, do you feel it? &gt; What are you talking about at home? I can't open my mouth. It is always he who speaks. Always the same things: work at the Ministry is a pain, .. .. colleagues are recommended, .. .. his head of the cabinet .... &gt; Interviewer: Say! - Carlo, shut up! - No! No! .... he is a hysteric and a big head. - Would I be hysterical and big-headed? I've always liked this guy, he's loyal. Bread with bread, wine with wine. - Is that your daughter? - Can't you see he looks like me? He is an angel. &gt; Interviewer: So, you have the worst father in the world for you. No! This no! I thought he was the worst father .. .. until I saw hers. - Ugly son of a .... &gt; You, Gabriella, don't you say anything? Don't you defend your father? Gabriella, defend dad. - Who keeps silent consents. - He defended me. &gt; So, you have reasons to resent your father. Of course! My father is selfish. He doesn't understand anything, he just quarrels! It's his fault that I'm in trouble. - What do you mean by "trouble"? - I'm expecting a baby. - Ah no! &gt; Is he responsible? - Unfortunately. &gt; How "unfortunately"? Unfortunately for my son! With the grandparents who will meet again! &gt; What will you do now? You will get married, of course. We would also be willing, but it is the old who do not want. &gt; So what? - I'll make a new life. - Who knows? The Foreign Legion. - I'd send you to jail. &gt; Behavior .. ..and parental misunderstanding caused the drama. &gt; Fathers, mothers, all is not lost. Repair! &gt; As long as you are on time, repair.
