TOEI Company Ltd. Presents Clinging to your home territory is absurd. There is a bigger operation overseas. Guns, ammunition, jewellery and narcotics. Frankly, it's a racket. Frankly, part of the continental policy of the country. I have my ground over there. All I need is a well-organised outfit. Arakawa, how about your Tenryu Clan? Mr. Kawashima suggests... that all the clans unite into one big patriotic body. We are mere gamblers. We never go further than that. That kind of work is not for my men. I'm sorry. Arakawa, you should know better. Let's go. 1934 - Spring. The sky caved in on the Tenryus, a big gambling outfit in Tokyo. The boss was helpless. Boss! Take over A successor was to be chosen... Take over A successor was to be chosen... from the six sub-clan chiefs. With the advice of Old Arakawa's friends, headed by Senba. The top-rated man was Shin Nakai, chief of the Nakai Group. Nakai, the Old Man won't like it. Why turn down the unanimous vote? I appreciate your support. Certainly, I belong to the Tenryus. But originally I came from the Nishios, in Osaka. A kind of outsider. There is the right man, who is an original member. Who would that be? Matsuda. Matsuda's in jail. He got five years. Two years left to go. He may get parole. Besides, he took... the charge all on himself for the clan's sake. So wait for him and give him the successor-ship. I'm against it. Technically, he sure comes next. A loyal man, too. But he should've turned somebody else in. No, he's not big enough. Nobody else could've wrapped it up. Anyway, we can't leave the clan leaderless. We could have an acting leader. So Nakai's out. All we can do is promote Ishido. He's bright and prudent, and he's Old Arakwa's son-in-law. I can't leapfrog Nakai and Matsuda. Count me out. You shut up. Well? Senba, I insist on Matsuda. The decision was carried over to another day. This time, all but Nakai agreed... upon Ishido as the successor. Ishido's been standing a bit below you and Matsuda. But not now. Treat him as an equal. Certainly. Remember, Matsuda's out of it. Another thing: we'll throw a big gambling party, in celebration of the succession. It's going to be a real big one, worthy of the Tenryu Clan. You help young Ishido and look after things. That clear? Yes, sir. The big-wig gambling party was scheduled... in six months' time, at Shuzenji Spa, Izu. Nakai started work on the preparations, with the help of his men. BAKUCHI-UCHI: SOCHO-TOBAKU Big-time Gambling Boss Planning by Hiroshige Goto and Keiichi Hashimoto Screenplay by Kazuo Kasahara Cast: Koji Tsuruta Junko Fuji Hiroko Sakuramachi Hiroshi Nawa Harumi Sone Tomisaburo Wakayama Directed by Kosaku Yamashita Is my sister in? - Hello. Madame? - Father. Minoru, your father's coming home. Mr. Matsuda's being released? Yeah. Minoru, how do you greet him? - Say it. - Hello, Father! A good boy. Shin. He's getting out? On parole, in two days. Are you sure? Positive. Congratulations. How wonderful, Minoru! You've been great. I'll let the others know. Oto! Oto, she's calling you. Oto, Mr. Matsuda's coming home! The Boss? You two have been most helpful these three years. I almost hate to let you go back to Matsuda. Now you'll help him re-organise the group. A small parting gift. Nakai. Mrs. Nakai. Brother. Thanks for everything. Forgive us whatever trouble we caused you. Now you can wear these. Matsuda Group Tenryu Clan Oto. Kiyo. Congratulations. You're going to start all over again. Good luck. Mrs. Nakai, you've been so nice. And about the succession... Don't tell Matsuda before I do. That goes for you, too. Boss! Oto, you put on weight. Kiyo, you've grown. Sorry, we hadn't time to call back the others. That's all right. You two have come. Nakai. Thanks for everything. Congratulations. Ishido, thank you. - Everything's alright. - Good. It's going to be just like the old days. Boss, I'm finally back. It's been a long time. He's happy. Boss, I'll never go away anywhere again. Use me any way you need. Listen... Tomorrow, we'll hold a celebration for you. That's very kind of you. Madame! Hello, darling. Hello. Minoru. Say it. Hello, Papa. How you've grown up! Tsuyako, don't. You go take a bath. Make yourself clean. It's been three years. You're teasing me. Sugi, Mizu, Hide... I couldn't protect them from those hoods. The Sakura hoods are quiet now. Well, they'd better be. Why don't you take Hiroe... and Minoru to a spa for a change? Because I have to get my group back on an even footing first. And call the others back. Matsuda... Listen... Do me a favour. A favour? From me, who was just released? Things changed while you were away. You haven't heard it all. And some of it might not sound too good, but don't lose your temper. Look, I've changed too, during my time in jail. What is it? Look. Succession? How about that! So you finally made it. Kohei Ishido, New President Ishido? Why...? Who on Earth decided it? The old folks and our clansmen did. I recommended you, but... Never mind me. Why not you? You're the right man. I come from Osaka. I refused it. But why Ishido? He's below either of us. I don't approve. Matsuda, once it's decided, it's decided. Right or wrong. You ought to know that. The Boss had to approve it. So did I. You must, too. Understand? Okay, if that's the way you feel about it. Hello, folks. Bosses. Friends. I have come home after three years. Nice to see you all again. Welcome back. Come on in. The wrong seat, Ishido. That's Nakai's place, not yours. Move over. Haven't you heard about my succession? Yes, indeed I have... but not beforehand. Matsuda! You promised. I had a talk with you. Now, I'll talk with him. You stay out of this. Ever heard of the Gambler's Code? When Nakai humbly refused the offer, he had a point. Still, you should've persuaded him to accept. You ignored seniority. Are you a man or a rat? You keep out of it. Matsuda... I said I approved of it. So forget it. All right, I will. But at least let me have my say. Matsuda! Yes, Senba? Yell somewhere else. It was our decision. You're getting out of line. I think you got out of line. What? We followed the proper order, that's all. Did you? Was it proper? When Nakai refused, why didn't you come to me? Or am I not responsible enough? Matsuda... since when are you so mean? Mean? Look, we gamblers are not saints. What did I lose my men and go to jail for? For the Clan! Mr. Arakawa taught me the order of things. Surely Ishido is his son-in-law, but he's below us. What happened to seniority? So? So if Nakai won't change his mind, I'll accept. That's proper. You spoil nice drinks. The meeting's adjourned. Matsuda, I've been patient today... but that won't always be so. An apology? Hell, no! All right, I'll talk to Ishido. So no more fuss about it, okay? Hey. You're getting weak. If you can't lie down, walk out of your racket. Or start over, alone. What's your choice? When I got in trouble in Osaka, and came to Tokyo years ago, the old man picked me up. He tidied everything up for me. And now he's in bed, worrying about the Clan wordlessly. I have to make this big party a success, to reduce my debt to him. I'll go on a visit tomorrow. In Osaka, I'll talk with Mr. Nishio about you. So, no trouble while I'm away. Another thing for you to remember: Be nice to Hiroe after three years' absence. All right... whatever you say. Promise? You heard him. He's a good husband now. Thank you. That's all right. Send a few thousand yen to Matsuda. He could use it. Yes. Are you sure it's a good idea, leaving him alone? Sure. He promised me. Besides, Hiroe is with him. How are they getting along, Oto and what's-her-name... Kumi? They seem to be in love. That's what I wanted to tell you. Oto's responsible enough to have a wife. So, come Spring...? Yeah, if they have a mind to. You arrange it. A nice wedding and a happy honeymoon, too. We even didn't know when we married. An old grudge, eh? You wouldn't know. Who are you? The Tenryus. Are you the Sakura men? Yeah. We made it up three years ago, didn't we? Or do we have no right to stick around? Easy. The man who killed your boss is back. How does that sound? This is a big chance for you. We're closing up. One more. - Hello. - Hi. He's asleep. Mr. Matsuda? Yes. Hey. That's enough. Something puzzles me. How'd you know I live here? Three years ago, I didn't. Somebody's behind this. Who? Who?! Talk! One of the Tenryus. - Their name? - I don't know! Talk, or else. That's all I know. You ought to have some idea. It's your internal trouble. The Tenryus...? That dirty rat! Now what? Ishido, this isn't a manly way to get me. Putting such a punk up to it! Why should I? I never saw this guy before. He said a Tenryu man gave him the idea, which brings me to you. Sorry, but you got the wrong person. Anybody know him? No. All right. Get out of here. Ishido... do you insist on your innocence? Why not? I am innocent! Would I do such a foolish thing, with the big party coming up? I don't believe you. I've been nice up to now, for Nakai's sake. If you keep denying it, I'll know what I have to do. I'll ruin the party! I've been nice just long enough, too. Interesting. So that's that, eh? I heard you gave up the right to succession. That makes me proud of you. It's one of the things you taught me, when I was with you. The problem is Matsuda. He sure has a point, yet he has a lot to learn. He's my best friend... Is there anything I can do about it? Well, I'll talk to the others. We may give him independent clanship, as Ishido's adviser. A good idea. But, remember: If he persists... you have to give him... the last word on behalf of the Clan. That's part of the Clansmens' Code. I know what you mean, sir. One more thing: Senba, your boss's friend is a caution. How's that? He's up to something, along with a man named Kawashima. A political organisation, maybe. Really? Excuse me... A telegram, sir. Bad news? Matsuda challenged Ishido. Boss, I'm back. You heard the news? Matsuda did it again. My carelessness, Ishido. Forgive him. You're not the one to apologise. In fact, I'm not sure yet. He thinks I paid the Sakura men to get rid of him. Those hoods? Yes, and I didn't do it. So I came for the Elders' advice before I act. Matsuda may ruin the party. We didn't waste time by waiting for you. We talked and came to a conclusion. A conclusion? We could send him on a trip as punishment. But since he's on parole, we put him on good behaviour. Any breach of it would mean banishment. That's our conclusion. You're his friend. You have the privilege of notifying him. Senba, he should be allowed to tell his side of the story. Let me hear it, then I'll make him apologise, if he should. No use. What's decided is decided. He agreed, too. Or do you want me to tell him myself? Boss, Matsuda's a good man, and you know that. Give him a break. All right. I'll tell him. Ishido, you're my friend, too. Look at me and answer me this question: Is there any arrangement between you and Senba? Arrangement? God, no. Are you sure? Nakai, believe me. All right. Sorry, no offence intended. Hiroe. Where is Matsuda? I'm waiting. He's gone. He's ashamed. You know where he is? I have to see him. Where is he? How should I know? A woman has no right to. You know that. Listen, I'll talk to him and make him come home. You worry too much. Mr. Nakai. I'm sorry. Let me talk to him. Are you going to use it? I know what you want to say. Put it away. Let us keep company. Don't worry, Oto. Just a nice, quiet talk. Leave us. Listen... Ishido had nothing to do with it. Believe him. Knock it off. I've taken all the humiliation... I'm going to take from Ishido. To you, I apologise. Forget it. Come home, nice and quiet. Or else? They expect you to behave, or else... banishment. Look, I'll arrange things in your favour after the party. Banishment, eh? Great... Then I'd have to kill Ishido. Matsuda... Listen carefully. No names yet, but there's somebody among the allies... who's preying on our clan. Ishido doesn't know that he is being used. If you fight Ishido, that's what they're hoping for. So drop any personal feelings... and help him defend the clan. If either of us had succeeded the old man, we wouldn't be where we are now. Ishido hasn't succeeded yet. We can prevent him succeeding, the two of us, can't we? I'm asking you for this favour. Help me. Matsuda... Still at it, eh? Nakai, what makes you think I can back off now? This is the vessel we drank to our friendship from. If you won't change your mind... I'll break it and fight you. It's a matter of principle. Want me to do it? All right. You win. For such a silly little thing... I have to lose face. I have to do this! Oto! What happened? I tried to kill Ishido. What?! Our chiefs came to an understanding. I know, but I couldn't stand it. Let me talk to Mr. Nakai before I go. An idiot! Do you know what you've done? We almost made it. I did it on my own. The Boss had nothing to do with it. So see to it that he won't get in trouble, please. I wish it were that simple. The Ishidos are preparing a raid. They are? Protect the Boss, please. Let me go! Let me take care of myself! No. Not after you came to me. Oto, are you ready to die? Yes, good and ready. Okay, if you're so determined, I'll talk to Ishido. You stay here. What happens to Oto? It's up to Ishido. He may insist that we turn him over. Then we'll have to. Then he...? Won't come home alive. But it would save Matsuda, at least. Keep an eye on Oto till I get back. In any way or other, we can't let him loose. Wait, Ishido. I've stood for enough, haven't I? Ishido... You'll have to go over my dead body. Mrs. Nakai... I'm sorry. Forget it and drink. Hungry? She's here. Where's Oto? I know he's here. Bring him out. Matsuda, do you know what he did? Yes, so I've come here, the only place he may show up. Boss! I'm sorry. Oto... how silly. What's the idea? He's one of my boys. I'm going to take him with me. No, he's going to stay here... until my husband returns. Don't make all his efforts go to waste. I've made up my mind. He did it for me... and he's a dead duck, no matter... how Nakai may settle it. I won't let him die alone, even if... it means I'm through with Nakai. No! That makes you admirable... But he is really trying. Think about Hiroe, too. I'm sorry. Oto's going to stay here! Get outta my way! You'll have to go over my dead body. Get out of my way. Kill me to end it all. No! You've got to live! Take him with you. Go on, leave. Don't you worry. I know what to do about it. Somebody go tell my husband. Look! Tsuyako! Tsuyako! I've settled it. Why did you... "My dear husband, "you must be shocked at this. "Perhaps my female intellect made me do it. "I knew all too well where you stood. "Still, I could not allow myself to hold Oto back. "Three years is too long... "not to understand the way he felt. "I firmly believe... "that you understood him, too. "At least I can take that firm belief with me where I'm going. "I hope my death will be useful... "for atonement and peace-making. "May your friendship with Matsuda last forever. "Darling... "I was as happy a wife as any woman could ever be." You go home. Right now. Darling... Do you realise who killed her? You are done, Matsuda. I know. Stop piling up disgraces. For your own sake... For her sake. I've crossed the bridge. There's no turning back. I'll ruin Ishido's succession party. A blow from me. Not as long as I live. Nakai... Is the Clan so important to you? Loyalty is. Don't do it, Matsuda. I see. Well... Nothing can stop me... Nothing. I thought we could talk. Matsuda, we are through. Wait! Are you trying to make her death futile? She killed herself to save all of you. Aren't you ashamed of yourselves? All right, Matsuda, I'll leave you up to her. You should apologise to him. Please. And don't make it harder luck for her. I thought you were used to my foolishness, Hiroe. And, having come this far, I have to go the whole hog. Hiroe. Divorce me. I'm sorry. Do whatever you want with me. Say something! Say yes or no. All right, hit me. Hit me hard. Please, I'm begging you. All right, Oto. Do as I tell you. Wash your feet. Not that. And live straight. You have someone else to consider. No... I can't. The Boss and me are in the same boat. That's the way it goes... and you know that! Shuzenji Hot Springs Retirement and Succession Party... For the Tenryu Presidents No sign of them in town. I see... If I know Matsuda, he'll come. Try the spas around here. And you, stay close to Ishido. Congratulations, Ishido. Thank you, Mr. Kawashima. There's something we want to talk to you about. What is it? Mr. Kawashima's idea: We leading members form an organisation, one of the national defence fronts. And I want you to give us assistance. I have a clan to consider. The Tenryu clan will fade out of the picture. What? I'll be the president, and you'll be one of the executives. Now, leave the whole clan percentage... of tomorrow's game, up to me. Where does it go? To our new organisation. Customarily, the percentage... goes to the retiring man, intact. All the guests know that. I'm sorry. Who do you think put you where you are? I did, by spreading some grease around. Crudely put, you are just my temporary substitute. All you have to do is follow my instructions. Ishido. We're counting on you. I bought a large quantity of narcotics, and delay in payment might get you, as well as us, in trouble. Change your way of thinking. You have nothing to lose. So that's what you mark the percentage for! Watch what you're saying. I don't claim to owe you nothing, but I have my own way of doing things now. Even you can't get out of line. Well, I heard nothing. We must do something. I never thought he'd go against us... at the last moment. He's young. On the continent, a guy like him wouldn't last long. Yugashima Spa, Agami How'd you make out? Shuzenji is crawling with their men. I located the venue for the party, and the inns for the guests, but not where Ishido is staying. No wonder. Nakai sees to it that he won't be easily found. It is customary that a successor... visits the local shrine. That's it. You! I'll kill you! Take him away. Oto... be nice to Kumi. You! Ishido... I'll kill you! We don't have much time. Don't get upset, and keep your mouth shut. You, go locate Matsuda. It's my fault. I'll make up for it. Matsuda was right... I should've persuaded you to take over. I was conceited. It's my fault. No. You're a fine young master. Hell, no. I've been Senba's puppet. He tried to seize our percentage... and sell the Clan... to that Kawashima man. He did? So that's what he was aiming at. Help me up and bandage me. Keep still. I've sent for a doctor. No. I'll show them that I'm not a puppet. Help me fulfil my duty. I don't care if it kills me. It's a matter of principle. Very well. Hold him tight. Ready? Masa Arakawa, President of the Tenryu Clan, has been managing well enough, with your kind back-up. But his old age... and illness disqualify him from his position. So now he retires, to be succeeded by the Boss of the Ishido Clan, Kohei Ishido. How is he? He was lucky. He'll pull through. But he needs complete rest. Mr. Ishido, how do you feel? Much better. That's good. Hey! What happened? Located him yet? - The Sanoya Inn. - Sanoya? Nakai, what a shame! Well, what do we do now? The games must go on. After they're over, we'll post a death notice, and have a conference. Sounds good. Anyway, let us keep the money for the night. Agreed? Wait. That doesn't sound reasonable. What? You and your friends are our allies, but not our clansmen. We sub-clan chiefs come first. And I, the top-rated one, will keep the money for the night. You talk big, but you're not responsible enough for that. You were supposed to look after things today. And look: You've let him be hurt and then killed. You deserve hara-kiri. It's obvious that Matsuda did it. Why aren't you after him? Because he's your friend? Or did you let him sneak in, I wonder? Senba. This place is under strict watch. Matsuda hurt him, but he didn't finish him off. It was an inside job. Who did it? Who else could've done it? I'll find out. We can't trust the murderer's friend... with the money. Can we, folks? All right, gentlemen. I know how to clear myself of your suspicions. Just until I get back, leave the money where it is. See that it remains intact. Suppose you don't get back? I will get back. Kiyo? Boss... Your wife is coming. Hiroe? I divorced her. I sent Kiyo for her. Oto, why'd you do it? You had to interfere in what wasn't your business! Oto... Why am I going through this? Done with my best friend, with my wife... Don't you see why? If you don't, get out of here. - No, I won't. - Get out. Boss, I killed my friend. I'm fed up with it all. We'd have to fight Mr. Nakai, too. That's crazy. Talk with your wife and think it over. Please! There's not much left we could do. A visitor, sir. Your wife. See her, will you? Upstairs, eh? No! - Move. - No! Move aside. No! Don't do it! It's better this way. Please, Mr. Nakai... Forgive him... You... Matsuda... Tell me... Is Ishido alive? My only regret is that I couldn't... finish him off. He is... dead. A murderer! What happened to Papa? You should've seen it. A big success. He won't be the one to keep the money after all. Take it to my room. But... You can't move it until Mr. Nakai comes back. He won't be back. We had a call from the police. There was a big killing at Yagashima. Both he and Matsuda got killed. No! He'll come back. Shut up! Who do you think you're talking to? Noguchi's back. Well, how'd you make out? What's the matter? Nakai!? Senba, he told me everything. You killed 'em all. Now it's your turn. Nakai! Who do you think... you're pointing your sword at? Is that your idea of loyalty? "Loyalty"? The heck with it! I'm just a mean murderer... Nothing else. Help! Somebody, help! Shinjiro Nakai. Age: 41. Occupation: Gambler He shall be imprisoned for life, on conviction of the following murders... he committed as Chief Nakai. Date: November 23, 1935. Place 1: Kasatakata Inn, Shuzenji. At the retirement party... for Old Arakawa, of the Tenryu Clan... he stabbed Tasaburo Senba to death... because of a personal grudge. Murdered Susumu Noguchi in the same way. Place 2: Sanoya Inn, Yugashima. Murdered his brother-in-law, Tetsuo Matsuda, due to a grudge. Murdered Oto Kobayashi with a sword.
