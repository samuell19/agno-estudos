It's witchcraft. Snakes, centipedes, frogs are put in a pot to fight. The survivor's poison is used for magic and hexes. If you drink the poison you will die. KODOKU MEATBALL MACHINE Good morning. I'm 50 years old. No, I'm 50 years young! Life begins here. Sorry. “I have no money to repay you!” Hello! I'm from JBA Debt Collectors. I'm Yuji Noda. Mr. Takahashi, I'm here to collect outstanding payments on behalf of the creditors. I'm broke. What? You haven't paid your water bills for 9 months or your electricity bills for half a year. I can't hear you! I can't! I can't! All he ever says is “I can't!” How about saying, “Yes, I can!” “Loan, 200,000 yen” “Close to loan limit” Watch it! You almost hurt me! Sorry... Get lost! What's that? Ah, ta-ta-ta-ta. Ah, ta-ta-ta-ta! I'll try harder tomorrow. If you fail today, you fail tomorrow. I'll try. - You like this job? - Yes! Then... collect more money. I will do my best. How much is your goal? 300,000. 4...I mean 500,000! If you fail, don't come back. I won't fail. Looking for something? Yes... I know every book on my shelves. Ask me and I'll find it. Thanks. Can I have this? Alright. Mr. Hase, I'll take care of the customer. Go ahead. This way. It's 250 yen. OK. “Member, Yuji Noda” Here's your change. Kaoru, can you tidy up? Right away. “Master of Rakugo” Mom? I'm short of cash for the senior's group tour. - I sent you 100,000 yen. - It's gone. Be more careful. I am! I don't waste money. Can I have another 100,000? You have a job. “Loan limit reached” “Loan limit reached” It's probably cancer. Cancer... We can operate and do radiotherapy, if it hasn't spread. Has it spread? I can't tell without further checkups but I'd say you have a month, maybe 3. Right...I see. I was feverish this morning so I took my temperature. I don't want to do it now. Understand? Hello. Where are you, Noda? At a shopping street in Senzoku. You didn't come in... Did you go straight there? Something like that. You promised me 500,000, don't forget. OK. 500,000, dead or alive. OK... Dead... What? - You have money! - No! - You do! - No! You do! No! I got it! I won't let you off! I know you can hear me! You have your pension! One a day. Hey! You meathead! I'll haunt you when I die. You're late. By 5 minutes. Who cares? Let's go. Where to? You forgot? You agreed to go for a drive! - Get in. - No, thank you. Why not? Come on! You can't break a promise! I'm talking about a drive! No! What's wrong? - Let go! - Give me a break! Hey! - Who are you? - Help me. He's trying to abduct me. I'm an officer. A police officer. What? I'm a detective. What are you doing to her? You're full of bullshit. What's going on? Is this your car? No parking here. OK. I'm going. Come with me next time. You saved me. Thank you! It's OK... You're the rakugo comedian! Sorry? I mean... You always buy the rakugo comedy cassettes! Yuji Noda, right? Yes, that's me. Why are you here? I'm looking for a woman who lives in the area. Kaoru Mita. That's me. I'm sorry. I meant to pay my debt... but there were always other expenses. If money's tight, pay me some other day. I'll pay now. Who knows what tomorrow will bring. I'll make some tea. I'm fine. Oh, no! What's wrong? I think I saw a cockroach! Looks like it's gone. Oh really? I wonder where it went. You have a nice smile, Yuji. My smile? I remembered your name. I think you're a very kind man. But you look slightly different tonight. A little pale. What's wrong, Yuji? Whatever it is, you can get over it! Smile! Go with a smile, Yuji. I have a suggestion. Would you like to come to an empowering place? “Love and Charity” Life is full of hardship, trials and pain. But that's what makes us feel alive. You can escape your trouble. Well, Yuji? Do you feel empowered? Uh...maybe. I'm not sure just yet. There are kids here... The church takes in orphans. Really... Maybe you should just join us. Join...? You have cash on you, Yuji? Money...? It's 100,000 yen to be a member. Honestly I have no money. I maxed out my card. Now you're trying to swindle me! You can pay later! So that's why you were nice to me. OK. I've had enough. Does your stomach hurt? No. It's my heart. Yuji? Yuji... I'm sorry. I wasn't tricking you. My heart aches like yours. I've had so much pain in my life. But my belief in Friendly God helped me forgive. And I feel empowered! OK. Can you forgive me for this? I forgive you. Pardon me! I'm sorry. Everyone tries to rip me off! I want to die but I don't want to die. Are you OK? Why not rest a little. “Cabaret” I want to die, I want to die I want to go to heaven My liver is not healthy My kidney is failing I'd erase myself with an eraser if I could... Isn't it a great bar? Hi! “Purgatory” Would you like to smoke? Are you OK? - Mind if I join you? - Me too. Wow, you're Bruce Willis! You're right! I get Jason Stathamthese days. Twirl around, twirl around! Twirl around, twirl around! Don't show my panties! Awesome! Gorgeous nails! See? Jiro, where are you? Moe, where's your brother? I don't know. Let's look for him. I knew you had cash on you. But that's not my... You owe me more after touching my tits, Baldy! Die. Pervert. - Yui. - OK. Sir. Make sure you pay what you owe. OK, Baldy? “IOU” Pay it back in 3 days or we'll visit your office! Where are you? You haven't called once! Did you get 500,000? I... I... Son, I need money. Why do they try to scam me? I'm a dying man! Baldy! Stay away from Kaoru! Come on, tough guy! You think I'm nothing, punk? - You kicked me twice! - He'd punch a kid? I'll hit you twice. I'll hit you twice! See that baldy? Is he a murderer? A murderer! Officer! He's a murderer! You! No! Hey! You're wrong! Stop right there! No! You've got it wrong! You! Stop immediately! Are you OK, kid? You helped to frame him! He wasn't a killer? You! Stop right away! Stop! You! I'm in Misuji Town, Area 4. Requesting backup! You stop right now! I can't hold it! What strange weather... Right hand out! Random killer at large. The officer in pursuit requests backup. Let's go! Jiro! We were worried about you! Come on. It's him! The killer! I'm not! Shock your husband with a red-haired baby! “Titans” I got you! What the...? I'm coming! I lent a friend 1 million yen and he disappeared. I don't know what to do. Are you having trouble getting back a loan? Call Nico Nico Collectors! Our super-efficient staff will get your money back! I'll eat them alive! Live from Oshiage. Yesterday a glass wall appeared here. The wall around Asakusa is made of an unknown material. We speculate that it's indestructible. Many residents are trapped in those apartments. The wall is embedded 100 meters and is 10,000 meters high. It's possibly a radiation hazard. Until we can rescue the trapped people we can only observe developments from outside. You want a solution? You want to solve your problem. For your own good. You egoists. I know you people love wars. Then fight to survive. Fools... You can't accept diversity. Death to you! No! Don't...! I've had enough... Finish me off! I'll die soon anyway. It's OK. I wish I'd apologized to Kaoru properly. It's probably cancer. Kaoru must be in trouble. I must help her. That hurts! Arrest him! Kaoru... Another one! Ouch, my nose! - You're wrong! - My nose! You're wrong! I've got you! Got you! Damn it! Let him go! Kaoru! One tried to kill me... Their own kind! They kill them? The Anomalocaris-thing mutates humans. They drill their victims' eyes. Lucky I wasn't blinded! One a day. Anything they're obsessed becomes a weapon. Seaweed can't be a weapon! He's dead? Now what? Why is he slicing that one's head? And poking it! What's that? That's the parasite! So if you kill it the whole thing dies. My cancer killed it? That's like cocaine. It changed! I'm beginning to understand. Takahashi! It's me, Yuji. Please help me! It hurts! Snip, snip! Don't! Where's the money? I'm not old! Come on, Baldy! Snip, snip! Look, they're fighting! - We have to run! - Run where? Suck on this! Ah ta-ta-ta! Ah ta-ta-ta! Ah ta-ta-ta! He's the killer! He isn't a killer! - He's infected by the parasite. - Poor man. Ah ta-ta-ta, uppercut! What's going on? What happened? I got dizzy! I can't die here like this! You haven't lost your human consciousness? Oh God! We're connected to that creature. I can read his mind. Focus! Think about a weapon! Focus and your body will be stronger. I'm losing it... I wanted to go to Paris... Sorry I called you a killer... Stop playing that game! Turn it off! Hide. Kaoru, it's me! Yuji Noda! - Yuji, I'll let you in. - Don't open the door! It's dangerous. But... You're OK. You're bleeding! Don't open the door! I'm OK. Moe! What is it? Kaoru! How about a drive? It hurts like hell! Hase! Kaoru... Kaoru! You moron! Don't kill my brother! Jiro! I hate kids! They're not immortal! We will terminate them. We're no longer a police force. We're a militia protecting citizens. We'll operate on our own authority! Charge! Don't! Let go! No! Kaoru! Satan! No, it's Yuji. See my nice smile! Yuji? I'll protect you even if I die doing so! Trust me! I'm worried about the church. OK, let's go to the church! Yuji! God, it hurts! - Not on asphalt! - Sorry! Excuse me! Yuji! Kaoru! I want to die, I want to die I want to go to heaven You want to die? It's slimy! I'm slimed. I have boobs. Kinda sweet! Twirling, twirling! You can't kill me with breast milk! Stop slapping me! Enough! Captain! Would you like to smoke? No way! “Purgatory Cabaret” Captain? We'll have to trust him. Fight together. Drive with me! Where's Yuji? Off to the church! I'm in charge! Get her! Catch! You kick ass! I can't die until Kaoru is safe. I see. Is Kaoru your girlfriend? Y'all die! Kaoru! I don't think I'll make it. It won't be long! That was close! We're doomed! Kaoru. I'm going to faint. Talk about books! What's the book on the 3rd shelf, 2nd rack, on the far left? Oh, it's a quiz... It's Social Science by Jun Kinoshita! Correct! It's around the corner! “Love and Charity” I'm not a Christian but I have a cross! Guru! Kaoru! He's no longer your guru! Jump over to me the moment we crash into him! Charge! Do it now! It hurts... Are you OK, Hase? I'll go... I'll go first. You guys stay right here. Go to your girl, Kaoru... You said you'd save her. With my guys. They'll help you. Captain! Hase! Kaoru, are you OK? Hase... I'm glad you're OK. I've always wanted to tell you that I... Hase? Hase! OK. It's his order. We'll save Kaoru. “This isn't who I really am” “Why doesn't anybody understand” “the real me?” Why is this happening? I thought the Lord would save us! This is too much! I hate this! I hate the church! I hate you too! I hate life! This is a trial given to us by the Lord. No god would make us go through this! It must be Satan! Satan... It's near. OK. Kaoru! Straight ahead! We'll take care of him. Go save Kaoru. Satan... Kaoru...? Kaoru! Kaoru... Yuji... Kill me... Lieutenant! Kill me... I'm a police officer! Show respect! “Everybody, die!” “I hate school!” “I hate you” “Go away” “Don't come to school” Thank you, Sir. Kaoru, Kaoru! Hurry, get up! She's all yours. Come on. Come on! Now! No! No! I don't want to! Kaoru. Let's live together. “What does it mean to live?” “No more taxes!” “Americans dropped the A-bombs!” “We're all eradiated” “What is happiness anyway?” Yuji. Kaoru.
