You drop the stick and I'll drive us there. No! No, no, no!!! ♪ How many of the cookies did you eat? Most of them. - Why? Do you think that's - why I'm sick? Maybe. Please don't be mad at me. I'm not mad. I wish I listened to you. I'm sorry I didn't. I don't want to die. I'm sorry I didn't turn around to take you home. - But you are not going - to die. - Dana's going to be back - any minute now And we're going to leave. How do you know she'll come back? We take care of each other. That's what we do. I love you, Maeve. I love you too. Kay? Hey kid. What are you doing out here? I'm snail hunting. - Did you see someone - out here? Just you. - Okay, well there's a, - there's a killer out here. - And there was one, - but now there, Now there's another. Are you okay? There's no killer anymore. There was one once. - A lot of people heard about it - because of this podcast, But he died a long time ago. - No, no, no. - He didn't. He didn't. - He came back and he, - he tried to kill us. But then we killed him. But then he, someone else is... still trying to. Please, help. I'll help you, okay. Okay. Okay. That ridiculous podcast. - We were finally getting things - turned around here, - Bringing back the real - vacationers. Then these idiots start talking about this one time incident. This one time. Four people died. It's a shame. Did you live here back then? Yeah, still do. Did you know Russ Thorne? No. He killed my mother's friends, and he tried to kill her. But she survived. That is why I came here. I wanted to help her get over what happened all those years ago, because I thought that it ruined her life. But then one day I realized that she had gotten over it, and that it was me who ruined her life, because if I hadn't been born, maybe she could've moved on. But instead she just became obsessed with protecting me. That is why I came here. I wanted to show her that she didn't have to worry, and that I could take care of myself. Mothers just want to protect their children. You brought over a container of cookies last night, and the Wi-Fi password changed this morning. Who the hell are you? I'm old! You hit an old lady! I'm sorry. My son deserved better than you and your whore friends! Your son is Russ? I tried to help you. - I tried to make it easier - for you Like I tried to help the other ones. You could've gone to sleep, then you wouldn't have tempted him, showing yourselves off like that. What was he supposed to do? How about just not kill people? When did that become so much to ask? He was a grown man, an adult, and we didn't make him do anything! Ahhhhh!!!!! ♪ Let me in! Let me in! It's me! It's me! Let me in, let me in!!! Let me in, let me in!!!! Ahhhhh!!!!! Oh, my god! Are you okay? I don't know, I don't think it's that bad. Kay is Russ's mother. Oh, my god! I knew it. The bastard! She's the one after us. Is this because I stole her beer? No Alix, this isn't your fault. This isn't any of our fault. We can take her. With a nail gun? I didn't see a nail gun. She had a knife, but... I don't know. Alix! Alix! Wake up!! Ahhhhh!!!!! Alix!

I don't have any feeling in this hand. You can thank your son for that. Okay. - I'm going to go back in - and help my mom. Take the keys and go. Dana. She's my mother. She is the reason that I came here. To save her. So I, I have to save her. I'm sorry that I got you into this. I wanted to be here. This is for my son. No! I'm not afraid of you! Trish: Dana! Ahhh!!!
