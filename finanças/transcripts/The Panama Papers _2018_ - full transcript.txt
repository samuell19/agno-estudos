BASTIAN: So, it was in the winter of 2015, I was at the house with my parents, with my wife and my kids. And everybody was sick, so really sick. I was the last one standing. Then I got this first ping, this first message from a person who called himself John Doe, and asked if I would be interested in data. NEWS REPORTER 1: We turn now to the bombshell causing shockwaves around the world, the so-called Panama Papers. NEWS REPORTER 2: What may be the largest leak of secret documents in history. NEWS REPORTER 3: Massive document leak allegedly showing how world leaders and the mega-rich hide billions of dollars. NEWS REPORTER 4: A new report which finds eight billionaires own as much wealth as the poorest half of the world's population. NEWS REPORTER 5: The papers paint a picture of wide-spread corruption and tax evasion. NEWS REPORTER 6: Now we have journalists stepping in, trying to tear down those barriers of secrecy and exposing what is happening behind closed doors. NEWS REPORTER 7: The revelation now kicking off a world-wide investigation. NEWS REPORTER 8: The whole issue here is about secrecy. People can create shell corporations and secretly move money around. NEWS REPORTER 9: World-wide estimates suggest tens of trillions of dollars are hidden in off-shore accounts. NEWS REPORTER 10: What's really shocking is the fact that twelve current or former heads of state are being accused in these papers. NEWS REPORTER 11: A journalist investigating the Panama Papers has been killed, sending other journalists into hiding for fear of their safety. NEWS REPORTER 12: The law firm is denying any wrongdoing, but this scandal, the Panama Papers, is just beginning. JOHN: My viewpoint is entirely my own. Income inequality is one of the defining issues of our time. It affects all of us, the world over. Still, questions remain. Why? And why now? The Panama Papers provide a compelling answer to these questions. Massive, pervasive corruption. It's not a coincidence that the answers come from a law firm. Mossack Fonseca used its influence to write and bend laws worldwide to favor the interest of criminals over a period of decades. BASTIAN: In the first day and the first days, it was so fascinating because this window in our world opened where nobody had ever looked in. I always wanted to write. Um, I wanted to become a novelist, but that didn't really work out, so I intended to become a sports writer. And that also didn't work out, and here I am, so... BASTIAN: Well, I think it's, um, more or less the defense for injustice in some way. We founded our own paper in Rosenheim, where I come from, because we had the feeling that all the media there are very much right-wing orientated and that your important stories are not really told. The fact that the data of Mossack Fonseca, which I knew as a black hole. They work with all kinds of criminals. You know, they all hold the information that people who want to keep their secrets put in there to disappear from the public. So I knew the company, and I thought, you know, this guy has access to the inner stuff of Mossack Fonseca. I'm the guy who wants to have it. KATRIN: Mossack Fonseca is a law firm from Panama, and their business is secrecy. If you have about a thousand euros, you can buy an offshore company, it's quite easy, and then you can even buy, like, shame directors which means that all the business you do, someone else is signing, someone else is "doing the business". So no one actually knows that you own stuff, and you can hide all your businesses. There's a world that is only accessible for the powerful and the richest, where they hide their money, where they enable money laundering, corruption, and actually, the plundering of all continents. NEWS REPORTER 13: Since 2015, the richest one percent have been more wealthy than the rest of the world's population combined. Now Oxfam says the poorest 10% have seen their income increase by less than $3 a year between 1988 and 2011. BASTIAN: If we have streets that are in not a good condition, if we do not have enough preschool places or good schools or if we do have to pay too much money for universities, that is due to the fact that there's so many people out there that are avoiding and evading taxes. That's a problem that is concerning every country all around the world, and every one of us. BASTIAN: In the first days, it didn't seem like this is the biggest leak in history of journalism. It only was, this seems to be a really good story. FREDERIK: The amount of data that Bastian and me received grew and grew. It was really like an addiction. I spent night and day clicking through the data. FREDERIK: When we then found the first names of heads of state heads of government. We found, you know, the best friend of Vladimir Putin. We found the Icelandic Prime Minister. Even celebrities. We always found something that I thought this is really worth reporting. If you find money tied to Bashar Al-Assad, and to Vladimir Putin, and to other dictators, then you somehow have the feeling maybe it's not a good idea that only I know. Some colleagues asked us, actually, are you crazy sharing a scoop? Giving away something our newspaper could have alone? But by sharing, we enabled this investigation to be something big and to make our investigations better. FREDERIK: So we reached out to the ICIJ in Washington and tracked the data. MARINA: ICIJ was created 20 years ago, and we can say that its mission is to defeat the traditional model of the lone wolf investigative reporter. The lone wolf investigative reporter is all for herself or himself, and so ICIJ was created as a network of investigative reporters in more than 60 countries who collaborate on stories that are too complex, and that need to be told from a collective perspective, from a collaborative perspective, that need to be told across borders, in collaboration. The general meeting is at 3:45. I am originally from Argentina. I went into journalism fairly young at 18, decided to be a journalist. I saw a lot of, uh, inequality in my country growing up, a lot of corruption, and I wanted to do something about it, but not from an activist point of view, but from a journalistic point of view. MARINA: When we started receiving the data from SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung and analyzing it and realizing that it was connected to 200 countries, that there were thousands of public figures and prime ministers and presidents and princesses and queens, and we have to do the biggest investigation we have ever done to do justice to this data. GERARD: I have to admit, my first thought was skepticism because I thought, well, we've done these stories on off-shore before. We've done, I think at that stage, four or five of them, and I was wondering how it was gonna be possible to get all the media partners interested in doing another story about off-shore, but we really had cracked the off-shore. Well, even though we had done previous stories, we didn't have this kind of information before, and I really thought it was a breakthrough. EMILIA: 11.5 million documents. You have all these complex kind of documents, some that you familiarize with, but sometimes you also have databases within them. MATTHEW: They were mostly emails, PDFs and everything else, but because there were so many millions of documents, we had to make it easy for journalists to search through them by using data sets, for example, all the clients of Mossack Fonseca, all the intermediaries, clients per country, and so on. BASTIAN: Every company has a number and a folder, so it's very easy to navigate, actually, in the original data. EMILIA: Then we upload it to a platform that we call "Blacklight", and this becomes like, Google, where you have a search box. So you're actually able to figure out what are some names of people of public interest in your country are present in that data. GERARD: One big danger here was that someone was feeding us the documents and then would perhaps slip in some false information into the documents. We wanted to make sure that wasn't happening. We had done some work on Mossack Fonseca in the past, so we actually had a set of documents that we could compare the information we were getting from the new source, the John Doe source, with what we had before. So my, you know, early stage was to to keep questioning everything and to make sure that we were jumping every hurdle. EMILIA: We decided to reconstruct a database of the companies and the shareholders connected to Mossack Fonseca. It's called Linkurious, and you just start typing people's names, or companies' names. You will get a circle called a node, and if you click on it, it start expanding, and then you will be able to see how many companies a person is connected to or who are the shareholders behind a company. MARINA: We literally took months to make available this information to the journalists, and we were making it available in batches up until the very end. I think the last batch of information of documents was released perhaps a couple of months before publication. MARINA: You don't just call great reporters that you have heard of. You have to call people that you know you can work with who are excellent reporters, but also people that you can trust. We had been getting to know the team at McClatchy, and they ticked every box. They really wanted to work as a team. KEVIN: Who's surprised that bad guys hide their money? You know, nobody was saying that was the surprise. The surprise is, yeah, you pull this veil back and you see this is how they do it. Everything you thought was happening, here's the evidence. It is. Yeah, because of... I'm a former South America Bureau Chief for the company, and Mossack Fonseca is a Latin company, Latin clients, and so it was an area that I could help with. I grew up in-in Ecuador as a child. I grew up a little different than most Americans because I saw the poverty, I saw kids with no legs begging in front of the soccer stadium on Saturdays, and so you know this different world exists, but to have it so spelled out clearly where you can see. You can start to see these connections, and then the rest of it is kind of the legwork. Okay, you know they have an offshore account, so what? You know, what do you do from there? What more can you say about that? MARISA: Usually as a, as a reporter, you have tips, you have some kind of roadmap of where you want to go with a story. With this, we had absolutely no roadmap. We weren't the big guys, you know? We were the ones who tried to break stories that the big guys didn't have. We were the, the underdogs, to some degree. It was also something that we had to kind of sell to our company at the time, because they had decided that they were gonna shut their foreign bureaus. They were wondering what value, foreign news would have to their readers. Why are people gonna care that the rich don't pay their taxes and crooks are crooks? Everyone knows that. What he didn't understand is that this was such an enormous amount of data, it was revealing a, a whole world. It wasn't just a story about offshores; It was, it was the goods. We had the goods on how it worked. JÃHANNES: I'm a nerd about journalism. I had been a journalist for over 15 years, and I look at myself as a person that wants to be the pipeline for minority groups to publish their story, to ask questions inside the government and find answers for those groups. JÃHANNES: I got a call from Marina Walker, the Deputy Director of ICIJ. She asked me, do-do you want to work on a leak? And we have a lot of Icelandic names in the leak. And we have your prime minister there and his wife. And at that moment, uh, everything froze in front of me. I thought to myself, wow, this is going to be a bomb here in Iceland. Nobody knew about his offshore company called Wintris. If you Googled Wintris before the Panama Papers, you couldn't find anything, and the prime minister hadn't been transparent about his involvement into the offshore world. Ladies and gentlemen, it's a pleasure for me to be here today at Iceland Investment Forum. It takes time for any given country to resurface from political turmoil after a large-scale economic crisis. We've already made significant progress, and I'm convinced that the policy this government has put forward is a sound one, and that is what bring further benefits. I have to admit that when you hear the prime minister is involved, his wife and other big business, people in Iceland very powerful people, then you start to think about what will happen? Hope to see you and your money in Iceland. GERARD: At this point, we continue on to London, and I met with The Guardian, because I knew if they were involved that it'd be easier to convince other media partners to get involved. LUKE: This was a really important leak. I think, I think we've had three super leaks this century so far. We have Wikileaks where we got the kind of unmediated view of the most powerful country on Earth, the United States. NEWS REPORTER 14: The biggest leak of U.S. military secrets ever. Website Wikileaks hit the "send" button on some 400,000 sensitive documents about the Iraq war. LUKE: Then we had Snowden who came along, who proved that all of our data is being collected all the time, that we're being surveilled. I, sitting at my desk, uh, certainly had the authorities to wiretap anyone from you or your accountant to a federal judge to even the President, if I had a personal email. LUKE: He sort of lifted what I would call mass surveillance. And then we had the Panama Papers. We had emails, uh, between the law firm and what they called their clients, which typically meant other intermediaries, banks, lawyers, accountants all over the world. We had passport scans and we had kind of incorporation documents, we had a lot of postage stamps from these very exotic locations. Pretty much all of it was set up so that no one can kind of peer inside. And, and suddenly, we had a kind of treasure trove of stuff. I've been on The Guardian for about 20 years. 12 years as a foreign correspondent bouncing around the world: Afghanistan, Iraq, Berlin, and then I was placed into Moscow, where I kind of really plunged into what you might call kind of post-Soviet muck. Corruption, espionage, Vladimir Putin, his money, question mark, and so on. JULIETTE: You're not just going in, going oh, look, you know, here's the whole story in black and white for me. It's a lot of detective work, of, of painstaking piecing together. You don't just dump stuff. You find the narratives, you make them matter to people. I joined The Guardian in 2011 as telecoms correspondent, and, because I speak French, I was pulled into an investigation into HSBC Bank, and its Swiss operation, which was the first ICIJ investigation that I'd worked on. NEWS REPORTER 15: The massive investigation by media outlets including France's Le Monde and Britain's Guardian Newspaper. They've revealed that HSBC Swiss private banking arm has helped thousands of wealthy clients to evade tax. JULIETTE: It was a big story over here, and then I, I got brought in to do the Panama Papers a few month after that. MATTHEW: I knew that there were companies in Malta that were using Mossack Fonseca to set up companies in Panama for their clients, but what I never imagined was that I would find the name of a cabinet minister in there. There were three companies that were set up. The names of Konrad Mizzi and of Konrad Mizzi's wife, Sai Mizzi, and Konrad Mizzi's children appeared in the documentation. There were never any names given for the third company, Egrant. My mother, through a different sources, one of who worked in a bank where documentation related to this third company was kept, worked out that the shares were being held in the name of the Prime Minister's wife, Michelle Muscat. I think that's when we realized that what we were dealing with in Malta was a system of state capture, that every institution of the state has been captured by this gang. They're laundering money, they're laundering campaign funding, and they're going to go to prison for a long time. I was sure of that at the time. WOMAN 1: This is all about secrecy and the ability to hide your money, your assets. LUKE: The rich and the super-rich, together with most sort of multi-national corporations, essentially exited quietly, sort of slipped off stage from the messy business of-of-of universal taxation some time ago. Before I started work on the Panama Papers, I thought that offshore was a kind of small, minor, who cares, you know, little aspect of the economic system we knew not so much about, and after reading the Panama Papers, I realized it is the economic system. It is the system. Eight trillion dollars is stuffed in tax havens, western countries, including the U.S., are losing about 200 billion dollars a year in tax revenues. PAUL: We were still debating, at that time, whether tax avoidance was a matter of public interest or not, or could you simply do what you liked with your money? But what it did establish for us, the scale of it, it just showed you there were underground rivers of money washing around the globe unbeknownst to most people. MARINA: We are writing about an incredibly damaging part of our economy that has become so central and so mainstream that it's creating French revolution levels of inequality and injustice. And the challenge we have is to be able to bring this story home to people, to show them that this story matters to you, affects your life, and guess what? You are the victim in this story. JOHN: Decisions have been made that have spared the wealthy, while focusing instead on reining in middle and low-income citizens. The collective impact of these failures has been a complete erosion of ethical standards, ultimately leading to a novel system we still call capitalism, but which is tantamount to economic slavery. Hopelessly backward and inefficient courts have failed. Judges have too often acquiesced to the arguments of the rich whose lawyers, and not just Mossack Fonseca, are well-trained in honoring the letter of the law while simultaneously doing everything in their power to desecrate its spirit. BEN ON PHONE: Leave your number, and I will get back to you as soon as I can. Thank you very much. KEVIN: Ben, hey, it's Kevin. Since we have outstanding matters, give me a shout back. Bye. One of the things that is particularly interesting about the Panama Papers is you have all the email traffic, all these different people who appear in these email threads going back and forth on how to handle something. You see their personalities and who in the Compliance Department, who is more serious about really cracking down and the tension between management and compliance. So at one point, the Geneva office basically says, you know, they-they found that you've got a Syrian tied to a, to Bashar Al-Assad whose now under sanction and everything at the time of these emails, and the Geneva office says, well, HSBC's still working with him so I don't see why we shouldn't. You know, so you kinda see what their thinking is. You know, they're willing to work with bad money, they just have to be clean about it. JACK: The customer said, I need to do the following in terms of hiding money. Will you do it for me? And Mossack Fonseca, these are all on the records, would say sure, we'll give you a Panamanian corporation, a trust a bank account somewhere else, and not to worry. Nobody will follow the trail. So simplified, it would explain how the system works in a really understandable way. I worked on a case involving a drug trafficker in the Cayman Islands. His lawyer in Miami said, go see Joe Blow in the Cayman Islands and he'll set you up. AL: We got everything a man could want. JACK: Joe Blow in the Cayman Islands sets up a corporation, the corporation opens a bank account. The guy who is the drug trafficker now puts money in the bank account and lets the lawyer in Cayman control that bank account. There comes a moment six months later... ACTOR 1: You took out the money. AL: Yeah. JACK: He wants to move the money to hide the trail, and he calls the lawyer and says, well, we need another bank account in the name of another corporation, and I want to transfer the money from Corporation A to Corporation B, and let's do it so the amounts don't match. And then, the moment comes when he says, I want to use the money, and he goes back for the lawyer in Cayman and he says, we're gonna have the bank that has the second transfer lend the money to the guy's brother who owns a, massage parlor in Houston. That way, it'll look like a loan, non-taxable. Where did you get it? I borrowed it. The whole thing looks like it's perfectly clean and perfectly okay. BASTIAN: Hey, how you doing? I was kind of skeptical because I wasn't a big fan of inviting so many colleagues. I thought, you know, maybe 50 or 100 really enough, and we knew around 50 or 100 from previous investigations, so we trusted them. JOURNALIST: Do they know that you got the data? Or that it's out there available for someone? FREDERIK: I wondered if we could keep this whole project secret. There's one basic rule, and that might sound rude, but it's important. That's shut up and encrypt. We always told our colleagues that you cannot tell anyone. Not your wife, not your best friend, nobody, about this project, and you have to encrypt everything. GERARD: You know, my primary interest at this-this stage of the investigation was to establish public interest. So we only were interested in public figures. You know, politicians, businesspeople, anyone with a public profile. And you know, the fastest way to find that out is to give a set of documents from Indonesia to an Indonesian journalist. Give a set of documents from Iceland to an Icelandic journalist. They would identify pretty quickly who was worth looking at on this list and who wasn't worth looking at. JOSEPH: I was angry that I had, nobody had called me, and I wasn't, I wasn't involved. You know, I have never collaborated in a giant thing like that. I collaborate within my newsroom, sometimes with, like, one, you know, an outside group. Most news organizations are not global, and then I think this becomes much more important because it seems like more and more, the best stories are global. This was like a ringing affirmation that you can actually do it, uh, and you can do it at-at scale. Then the ICIJ said, for example, we need somebody in Panama. And I said, I don't trust anybody in Panama. RITA: When I first looked at the assignment that we were going to do, I flipped. And the first document I saw, it was an invoice. That's when I said, oh, my god. This is huge, because invoices are probably one of the most, private documents within a law firm, and then when I see the names of people I know in the database, you know, I was really, really, really scared because I knew what was coming behind that, and I knew the consequences that this was going to have. WOMAN 2: Rita Vasquez was also a lawyer in the offshore services industry for many years, so when we learned that, we were fascinated. We had the opportunity to work with an insider who understands this industry from within. RITA: Seeing my friends and people that I care for in that data really made me wanted to go deeper into the project. As a newspaper organization, it is not our duty to tell if a private person is doing something wrong with their own money, but it's our duty to tell if somebody who had access to public funds or if somebody who had, be part of a government or had some sort of a jurisdictional power was doing something wrong. ROBERTO: The mandate of La Prensa was to return freedom of expression to the country as an infrastructure for democracy. In the midst of dictatorship. ROBERTO: But somehow it worked, and in six months, we were the newspaper of record of Panama. When we sat at our first editorial meeting after everything was set up, we said, well, how are we gonna handle this? Do we go softly increasing our pressure or do we hit 'em straight in the face from day one? We decided the second. SCOTT: When we heard Mossack Fonseca, we knew that we were uniquely positioned within the project because I played for the Mossack Fonseca softball team in the BVI. Four of our closest friends worked for Mossack Fonseca. And so we had a perspective that out of the journalists, there were two people that knew the inner workings of that company better than anybody. My journalism career was never going to lead to any kind of greatness. I was never gonna work for the New York Times. You know, I was the English editor of La Prensa in Panama. That's not the sort of things that make a great bio, and I always compared it to a career minor league pitcher that suddenly you get to start game seven of the World Series. When you find out it's world leaders, it's drug traffickers. la Reina Del Sur, who is one of the most famous female narco-terrorists in history; Carlos Quintero, who is described as making Pablo Escobar look like a baby. All of these names that come flooding at you, and you, your first thought is, how did they get away with this? BASTIAN: At least that's my assumption. I mean, we've been working on offshore since, for 2012. My private explanation, more or less, is that I know that the source had contact with other outlets, even before me, and they had not reacted in the way that the leaker wished they had. JOSEPH: Some outlets may have passed just because they tend not to do giant collaborations. You're devoting some of your best people to something that might take a year. That, resources are scarce. Investigative talent on your payroll is-is scarce, it's expensive, and you're, you're taking a leap into something that, from the beginning, you know is not gonna be an exclusive. JOHN: The media has failed. In addition to SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung and ICIJ, and despite explicit claims to the contrary, several major media outlets did have editors review documents for the Panama Papers. They chose not to cover them. BASTIAN: There's this probably frustrated person or those persons, we don't know, trying to reach someone that is actually listening. LUKE: I mean, there was a flavor of John Doe's personality. John Doe was worried about exposure. He was also kind of worried about his own sort of personal safety, so we don't know who it is. It could be a he, it could be a she. I don't think it's a they. KEVIN: I don't think anyone benefits, you know, it's kind of death by a thousand cuts if you give a little information here, a little information there, you end up compromising your source, and so I've kind of pushed back internally, I think, on that, so that people are more cautious about what they say about the source. JOSEPH: There are lots of good reasons for sources to be afraid of talking to the press. It can be an enormous risk. You know, they can get fired, they can get jailed in some places, they can get killed. And so, but one of those reasons is they don't trust the operational security of the journalist, and sometimes they're right to be very worried about that, and they should, you know, if you're a source out there, you should do your due diligence and pick your journalist carefully. JOHN: I've watched as one after another, whistleblowers and activists in the United States and Europe have had their lives destroyed, and the circumstances they find themselves in after shining a light on obvious wrongdoing. NEWS REPORTER 16: Snowden, who was holed up in Hong Kong, wanted in the U.S., is now in Russia. JOHN: Edward Snowden is stranded in Moscow, exiled due to the Obama Administration's decision to prosecute him under the Espionage Act. Bradley Birkenfeld was awarded millions for his information concerning Swiss bank UBS, and was still given a prison sentence by the Justice Department. Legitimate whistleblowers who expose unquestionable wrongdoing, whether insiders or outsiders, deserve immunity from government retribution. WOMAN 3: Because of its nature, of how global it was, we all realized that we need to get together in person, so Munich was the perfect place, of course, because we needed to go to the home of SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung. KEVIN: That, itself, had to stay secret, so you couldn't say, "I'm in Munich for X." People will naturally ask, well, you know, what, what are you doing there? Oh, work meeting or, uh, you had to come up with something that didn't sound anything like what you were doing there. BASTIAN: The meeting was kind of the decisive point. it was more or less our job to make people enthusiastic about it and to get them on board. BASTIAN: I was so nervous. I hadn't slept for three nights because it was, I mean, I was really, really nervous because I thought if I mess this up, you know, then this is the big, the big chance. The biggest collaboration of investigative journalists... Sitting in front of more than a hundred journalists showed me the first time how big this project already was at that moment. JULIETTE: It was like the United Nations of journalism, and I've never experienced anything like it. We were working on a story, and we were all working on it together. EMILIA: Sorry, well, I'm Emilia. I'm from Venezuela. I think... MARINA: We are not, uh, forcing you to do this story. We are not paying you to do this story. This is the story, and you need to invest in it, and you are only going to get out of it as much as you put into it. BASTIAN: Everybody was, I'm all in. I want to know more. WOMAN 3: It's a time right now in newsrooms of great uncertainty. You know, what will be the fate of newspapers, which used to be the watchdogs of the media. LUKE: In a time when everyone is broke, when no one's clicking the ads, where Facebook is taking all our money, where, where newsrooms are-are just kind of empty-pocketed... MARINA: We really had to convince these media organizations and these journalists to work together, and we often got responses like, why do we need you? Or why do we need one another? We can do it on our own. And perhaps 10, 15 years ago, it was pre-media crisis and a lot of newspapers were feeling really strong still, and they still had foreign correspondents and thought that they could do it on their own, but as the crisis in the media took place, and stories became more complex, as technology evolved, it became obvious that we needed to join forces, and they learned through the process how much more impactful and powerful their reporting can become when we work as a collective. BASTIAN: We immediately realized the impact of having more people from different countries inside the investigation because we had more, more, more findings. LUKE: Generally, I would say we found the anonymous international rich. We, we found Spanish royals, we found a German chicken farmer, we found a French dentist, we found people who would, use fake names when dealing with their lawyers, so instead of saying, you know, you know, hello, here is Ivan, you know, they would say, "Hi, it's Harry Potter." And, and there was correspondents, you know, dear Harry, your $25,000 has arrived in the Bahamas. I mean, it was just like the wo- most weird fishing expedition. I mean, there were fish you would expect, and there was some very ugly, small fish you didn't expect. BASTIAN: Whenever I went into the data, I found something new. I found scandals in Africa, in Latin America. SPORTS ANNOUNCER: Messi now, everyone on the edge of their seats, Messi going for goal! Oh! SPORTS ANNOUNCER: He's a man on a mission! MAN 2: Lionel Messi, his family fortune, is in the Panama Papers, and is now in the courts. No one in their right mind in Latin America thought that FIFA wasn't corrupt. It was not a surprise to find the FIFA officials. That was kind of one of, people thought was gonna be in there. Kids are under contract, 13 or 14, whether or not they ever become a pro has very little to do with their talent level, and more to do with which lawyer is screwing what agent in a business deal. In Lionel Messi, there's no evidence that he himself had any hand in any of this, but the people who handle him and the whole contracts and everything, they did. GIANNI: And we will restore the image of FIFA and the respect of FIFA, and everyone in the world will applaud us and will applaud all of you for what we'll do in FIFA in the future. LUKE: We found Sergey Roldugin, Putin's best friend, ostensibly, second-hand car, not very wealthy, but we found almost a billion dollars. It came from Bank Rossiya, which is a kind of crony bank from the regime in Saint Petersburg, right through to secret offshore companies, and then a lot of that cash was recycled back into Russia, including, um, into the wedding resort where Putin's daughter, Caterina, got married in 2013. And so from Russia, what we saw was, in a way, what you might call a kind of neo-feudal system. You could see how not just Putin's KGB chums were billionaires, but how the next generation were accumulating assets, marrying each other, dodging American sanctions and so on. BASTIAN: I mean, if you're Vladimir Putin, you don't go to Mossack Fonseca and say, "I want a company in my name." But you'd probably send someone that you trust. And this is exactly how this world works. TIM: When you can set up corporations in such a complex way and changing ownership. One woman I looked into was Leticia Montoya, a director in 10,969 corporations. Think about that. I mean, she doesn't, has no idea whatsoever what those corporations do. RITA: It's just a job, and she's a secretary. She, I mean, those who went to her house could have seen that she has no money, she lives in a fisherman community, not in the city. I mean, it's not like she made any money on this. JACK: This has gone on country after country after country. The amounts that are being pulled out are really at the expense of average people who simply can't get services from their government because the money's been flat stolen. JACK: I spoke at a conference to the Inter-American Bar Association in Cochabamba, Bolivia, and I tried to say, lawyers job is to keep people honest, and you shouldn't be helping them evade the law or break the law. My audience began to laugh at me. I blew up. Why do you think you don't have clean water? Why do you think people are so poor? It's because you, as a group of professionals, are teaching people how not to be participants in your society. SCOTT: The fundamental question I ask is, well, who makes money off this? Who makes money off this industry? And obviously, Mossack Fonseca made a lot of money, and obviously their clients who avoid taxes, they make a lot of money, but banks also make a lot of money, financial institutions, Wall Street. You can't have a major business if you don't have banks complicit with your business. TIM: The banks are certainly a key cog in this whole mechanism set up to create distance between the real owners of the money and-and-and the corporations that nominally, have control over it, but banks donate a lot to politicians, and uh, you know, there you go. WOMAN 4: The banks and the accounting firms and the law firms, they are basically spending all of their resources in trying to damage national treasuries in creating an illusion of-of an economic system that works only for the 1%, and they are working to deepen that gap between the 1% and the rest of the world. WOMAN 4: We found David Cameron's dad in the data with his offshore fund. DAVID: I'm very relaxed about, publishing these things. There's no secrets about my status. I am paid handsomely as your Prime Minister, and that is my main source of income, and I have a house I used to live in before I moved into Downing Street, and I rent that out and I get the income from that. I don't have other sources of income, so there will be no surprises, in terms of my tax affairs, but I'm very relaxed, as I've always said. Nothing's changed. JULIETTE: It wasn't even a surprise that his dad had had a fund. It's just that he wouldn't say he had money in it. In order to not have the fund taxed in the UK, you had to have majority of foreign directors on the company board, so the third was Swiss, a third were, were in the Bahamas, and-and everything was run out of the Bahamas, so they had this army of people just assign things there, so they were pretending to, devise the investment strategy and trade gold and bonds and things like that, but all the instructions were coming by telephone from London. MAN 2: One of the thing is we found is not only did Mossack Fonseca have a number of Chinese companies that it registered in Nevada as shell companies, some of those, perhaps, to do business in the United States, but more likely than not, to hide assets somewhere else. MAN 3: Brazil was one of the, the hottest things, and having been a correspondent there myself, I was very interested in working with the Brazilian team. TIM: We found payoffs to politicians. More than $700 million in bribes had been paid. MAN 4: Two-thirds of the country's legislature had been tied to off-shore companies. Many of the politicians were using shell companies through Mossack Fonseca in Nevada to hide assets they owned back in, in Brazil. Nobody pays a bribe and says, hey, here's a bribe. They do it through consulting fees, they do it through structured investments, and they do it through shell companies that pay other shell companies. MAN 5: The papers were very clear that this problem is not limited to small countries in Africa. The problem is huge here in the United States. The tax evasion problem is huge here in the United States. KEVIN: There were a lot of Americans in Panama Papers, so here's this perception that there weren't. I think what was missing was a Putin-type big name, but the very kind of people you'd expect to be in the Panama Papers were in there. all kinds of SEC fraud, pump and dump, penny stocks, and a lot of hedge funds. Those kinda guys who need that anonymity to make that work. Those guys are in here in some significant numbers, and unfortunately, that's gotten easier, not harder in the aftermath of Trump's election. DONALD: I am officially running for President of the United States, and we are going to make our country great again. BASTIAN: Having Donald Trump as the President of the United States let me feel a little bit strange knowing that he also had some offshore deals in his past. HILLARY: He didn't pay any federal income tax, so-- DONALD TRUMP: That makes me smart. HILLARY CLINTON: --if he's paid zero, that's zero for troops-- MAN 3: Trump is obviously one we were focused on from the very beginning. He appeared about 3,450 times that we know of. That's not to say his partners. That's just him by name. The big find was a lot of documents around the Panama Hotel project. NEWS REPORTER 17: Trump Ocean Club soars over the Pacific and Panama City. It's also where criminals, everywhere from Russian gangsters to money launderers for Latin American drug cartels were able to hide their cash. MAN 3: There we found contract information between him and the developer, Newland. One of the things I think that was very helpful in the Panama Papers is it actually showed Trump's business model. It was a contract that showed how he got paid, how his name was leased. This really wasn't known, and the documents, here we had physical proof of how, you know, how he arranges things. REPORTER 18: As a former money launderer, the Trump Ocean Club, how would you rate it in its quality. MAN 4: For money laundering? MAN 4: Oh, I'd say triple A. JACK: You get control of the country, you move your family into all of the important jobs in the country, and then you use that as an opportunity to enrich yourself. NEWS REPORTER 18: The man they credit with Donald Trump's victory, the President Elect's own son-in-law, Jared Kushner. JACK: What's now going on is exactly that, and what I think is also going on is that our president has cozied up to any number of these kleptocrats because he wants Americans to think it's the new normal. NEWS REPORTER 19: The central figure in the investigations into Donald Trump's inner circle, and possible ties to Russia. ADAM SCHIFF: It was Manafort... HIMES: Paul Manafort... CARSON: Paul Manafort... NEWS REPORTER 19: Long before he was president Trump's campaign chairman, Paul Manafort was paid millions by a Russian billionaire with close ties to Vladimir Putin. MAN 3: That is the closest we've been able to get to Manafort. Manafort seems to have been paid through companies in Belize. I've spent a lot of time looking at these shell companies. MAN 6: Donald Trump's friends, people of his cabinet, advisors, have been active in the offshore business. RON: Mister Mnuchin, you ran a hedge fund for a few years starting in 2004, and I've been trying to get my arms around the Mnuchin web of bank accounts and shell companies. They were in Cayman Islands and Anguilla. How many employees did you have in Anguilla? STEVEN: Treasury Secretary Nominee we didn't have any employees in Anguilla. RON: How many customers did you have there? STEVEN: We didn't have any customers that resided in Anguilla. RON: Did you have an office there? STEVEN: We did not have a office ourselves there. RON: So you just had a post office box? STEVEN: Senator, let me explain to you, okay? RON: It's just a yes or no answer. I'm already over my time. Yes or no? Did you just have a post office? other senators will defer some time so I can, I can answer this for you, because I think it's an important issue, but no, we had-- RON: Mister Chairman, this is... SENATOR 1: I think he should go ahead and answer it right now. SENATOR 2: He should get a chance to answer the question. SENATOR 1: Yeah. RON: I'm very troubled about this question of how you're gonna unrig the system if you've got a record of taking advantage of tax shelters that, in effect, have zero percent tax rate. Thank you, Mister Chairman. The taxes you pay are compulsory. They come out of your paycheck, you can see it once or twice a month. There're no Cayman Island deals for you, not, none of those kinda sweetheart overseas deals for you the way Steve Mnuchin, the Treasury Secretary, got. Then there's another set of tax rules for the fortunate and the well-connected. They can pretty much decide under the tax law what they're going to pay, when they're going to pay it, and in some instances, almost nothing. MAN 6: The problem today is really that the U.S. is the best place to put your assets. MAN 6: Over the last couple of decades, we've seen increasingly that shell companies registered in the U.S. are used to commit all sorts of crimes from human trafficking to drug trafficking to arms dealing. The list goes on and on. BASTIAN: Looking to Delaware, looking to Nevada, that's a, for example, a jurisdiction Mossack Fonseca was very active. KEVIN: We found a lot of Brazilians hiding property owned in Brazil through Nevada offshore, so Nevada was being used by Brazilians in a way that Cayman Islands, Bahamas might be used by an American trying to hide ownership of an asset. DINA: Well, Nevada has always had this approach to raising revenue that we wanna attack somebody else, not the people who live here. Though, back in the '90s, they decided to become the Delaware of the west and tried to follow that example and make it very easy for shell companies, LLCs, to be set up there without having any kind of information available about who owned them or who benefited from them. I said, at the time, that it was, might as well hang up a shingle and say, "Welcome scumbags and sleaze balls" because those are the kind of people who want to keep their information secret, but it became a source of revenue, so you didn't have to raise taxes. DINA: Well, I'm afraid they're rolling back the protections that were put in at Dodd-Frank and a lot of that was about accountability and transparency. Banks fought that, so they're certainly not gonna want to open it up any further. MAN 5: You can find tax havens all around the world. They are in the U.S., they are in the UK. GERARD: Now having done six of these projects, I would say with some certainty that the, probably the biggest tax haven in the world is-is Britain, and its, you know, its former colonies. JULIETTE: We're open for business. We like oligarchs. I don't want to exaggerate and say we're just a tax haven, but you know, the-the state is-is captured by finance. GERARD: Close behind it is America, and I think in the future, it would be great if someone gave us, you know, Delaware leaks. We would uncover, you know, secrets that may be bigger than anything we've ever done before. JOHN: I call on the European Commission, the British Parliament, the United States Congress, and all nations to take swift action, not only to protect whistleblowers, but to put an end to the global abuse of corporate registers. Tax evasion cannot possibly be fixed while elected officials are pleading for money from the very elites who have the strongest incentives to avoid taxes relative to any other segment of the population. FREDERIK: I was actually concerned every day about the security of this whole project because let's face the facts. Journalists like to speak about their work. GERARD: You know, every journalist you bring in, they're probably going to tell their life partner, they're probably going to tell their best friends, so the risks were going up exponentially every time you brought somebody in. MATTHEW: We were so focused on the digital part that I think you forget that a lot of journalists are going to need to have interviews with sources, they're going to have these interviews in bars or in cafes or in public places, and they're not going to be conscious of the fact that other people might be following them or listening to their conversation. LUKE: It's funny, really, because to, generally, toextract secrets from a journalist, you just need to take the journalist to the bar, buy the journalist a beer or maybe two beers, if they're, if they're being kind of tricky, and they will tell you everything. MAN 7: My colleagues say, I haven't seen any stories. What are you doing? I say, it's a project. It's a regional project, actually worldwide, and we're just looking at something. And they say, well, when's it coming out? Well, I couldn't really answer. JÃHANNES: You had this in mind the whole time that one mistake could jeopardize the whole project. RITA: My life, during all those months, was kinda like a spy life. I couldn't tell them what I was doing, and I felt awful because, at the same time, I was investigating my friends. I would go to dinner parties, and during the day, I was just searching documents that somehow mentioned them. EL NORTE: We felt responsible for their safety and that that was also something we repeatedly told our colleagues. Be aware that there is colleagues of us out there risking their life with this reporting, and if you tell too much, you could risk their life. BASTIAN: In the last weeks before our publication date, we had to do everything to protect our source, so we stopped all communications. We destroyed effectively the-the devices that we used to communicate with the source. My iPhone and my computer. We deleted all the files with several programs, so run it over and over and over until it was completely flat. But then, again, we weren't really sure, you know, if you really can trust this, so, I more or less took a hammer and started smashing the things. We didn't want to throw it away because we were so paranoid back then that we thoguh if someone finds it, maybe he can do something with it. MARINA: The most dangerous moment in the investigation, and the most tense moment, when we start reaching out to people for comment. If we have had a year to look at your bank information and your company information, we are not going to surprise you. BASTIAN: You don't approach people and say, listen, the team of Mossack Fonseca, you lost all your data. JULIETTE: The camera crews for the broadcasters involved in the project descended on the offices of Mossack Fonseca in Panama City and demanded to talk to someone, get a statement. BASTIAN: We sent them an email. We saw documents that seemed to indicate that you have many troubles with your due diligence and the way you choose your customers. BASTIAN: Then it follows, um, a long list of questions. Very detailed, very much to the cases. So they said, we're not involved in illegal dealings. We have never contact with the customers directly. We only work with intermediaries, which are lies. Well, I've heard, well now, everything might blow up. Now it will be hundreds of lawyers trying to stop our reporting, hundreds of people all around the world get knowledge about our investigation, and that's people like drug lords, criminals, and of course we feared that something might happen. RITA: It was very stressful for-for all of us because at that point, yeah, we had to call our sources, we had to call the people that we were writing about, and people started to know more and more and more. We started to have a bodyguard because that's when we received a non-direct threat by Mossack Fonseca. So they came and said, you know, we know you have a journalist who's helping the international media, and she, and she's been she's been paid for, and she is trying to diminish the reputation of our firm and the country, and she was gonna have to, you know, suffer the consequences. So the paper immediately said, you know, you can't be around without any protection. My friends were here. We go pick them up at the hotel, and there's, there is a bodyguard there driving the car. So we said, oh, it's just an Uber. But we forgot to hide the gun he had in the middle of the front seat. We had to live a double life and-and that really was something that changed our lives from that moment. FREDERIK: The most frightening moment for me shortly before publication was when I personally had to write an email to the Kremlin basically addressing it to "Dear Mr. Vladimir Putin" and laying out what we found in regards to this net of companies around his friend Sergei Roldugin that was funneling hundreds of millions of dollar out of Russia, and I've never written an email to Vladimir Putin before. Some days later, Vladimir Putin's spokesperson, Mr. Peskov, did a press conference in Moscow. DMITRY PESKOV: The documents show nothing about Mister Putin. Everything that was, interconnected with our president, was written by newspapers. It was written by journalists without having obvious facts for that. FREDERIK: It was clear to me, oh, shit. He's speaking about that email I sent some days ago. DMITRY: And now we're understanding this is nothing else by, but a reflection of, let's say, an overwhelmed Putin-aphobia disease that unfortunately has quite spread now in lots of media. FREDERIK: It was clearly obvious that the Kremlin was pissed off. MARINA: We got a lot of legal threats and there were so many. They were really piling up. Everyone that we contacted recruited the best lawyers to threaten ICIJ, to try to, um, get us to show them documents, to try to get us to not publish the story. SCOTT: Drug trafficking, income inequality, poverty. You look at those problems in the world, and a lot of the keys to addressing those problems are in the Panama Papers. Even though you feel like you, you may wake up one day and-and have somebody in your bedroom pointing a gun at you, you feel like youhave to keep going on this because it's too important. JÃHANNES: So coming from Iceland, I knew that if I would start asking questions about the offshore company of the Prime Minister, early, then all the alarm bells would ring inside the government and inside the institutions here in Iceland. So we had to find a way to get the reactions from the Prime Minister on camera. So we decided after a lengthy talk about the ethical issues, to confront him. JOURNALIST: Mister Prime Minister, what can you tell me about a company called Wintris? PRIME MINISTER GUNNLAUGSSON: Well, it's a company of, if I recall correctly, which is associated with one of the companies that I, was on a board of, and, it was a, hadan account which as I, as I mentioned, has been with the tax, on the tax account since it was established. So now I'm starting to feel a bit strange about this question because it's like you are accusing me of something when you are asking me about a company that has been on my-- JOURNALIST: Let, let-- PRIME MINISTER GUNNLAUGSSON: tax return from the beginning. JOURNALIST: Yeah, it must be okay for me as a journalist to ask the Prime Minister about personal-- PRIME MINISTER GUNNLAUGSSON: Yes, sure. But you are indicating that I have not paid, taxes on it. JOURNALIST: No, I'm just asking you questions. PRIME MINISTER GUNNLAUGSSON: Okay, okay. JOURNALIST: So, so, uh, to go into the details, I would like my partner to do it in Icelandic because I don't have the details, uh, to discuss it. KRISTJÃNSSON: The time between the interview and the publication was a stressful time. The wife of the Prime Minister, she posted a Facebook status talking about some attacks from the media. Soon, I realized that, uh, we shouldn't be afraid because we had all the materials, we had the interview, uh, and uh, I talk, I told my staff, you know, just relax because we are going to publish this and, uh, it will be big. PAUL: We were utterly convinced that night that we were gonna light the Blue Torch Paper despite nobody going beforehand, there was still an air of expectancy. People knew a big story was coming. LUKE: What was weird was about ten minutes before we were due to press send, Edward Snowden tweeted out a link to the English language website of SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung MAN 4: The people who follow him then were alerted to this, and that's a pretty wide universe. JULIETTE: Gerard Ryle, the Director of the ICIJ, is hammering the phones getting everyone to just hold their nerve. GERARD: I thought it was very important that we all hold the line, that what was happening with the press conference from the Kremlin and what was happening in Iceland at the time where parts of the story were getting out through Facebook, through the Icelandic Prime Minister's wife, like there was a lot of nervousness, and I really thought that all of these events, all of these small things happening, even though, you know, we were being talked about a week beforehand, no one really knew the bigger story. JULIETTE: You know, I'm, uh, describing it a bit like a, a general standing at the top of the hill holding back the troops, you know, waiting as the opposing army approaches, approaches, you know, hold, hold, hold, go! Charge! TIM: When that day hits, things happen fairly quickly. NEWS REPORTER 20: The so-called Panama Papers now exposing the secret financial dealings of politicians and celebrities. NEWS REPORTER 21: Many of the world's most powerful politicians, wealthy business owners and popular celebrities are now desperately trying to distance themselves from the fallout and consequences of the Panama Papers. MARISA: There was an immediate response on social media. MAN 8: They're all on the inside, we are out on the street looking in. Hello? MARINA: This thing exploded and took an entire life of its own. NEWS REPORTER 22: We turn now to the banking bombshell causing shockwaves around the world. NEWS REPORTER 23: Panama Papers... NEWS REPORTER 24: NEWS REPORTER 25: The Panama Papers... NEWS REPORTER 26: The Panama Papers. GEORGE: What may be the largest leak of secret documents in history. NEWS REPORTER 27: A blockbuster release of millions of financial documents. NEWS REPORTER 28: This is the biggest attack on the tax shelter industry. It's a trillion dollar industry. NEWS REPORTER 29: It is. It is a trillion dollar industry. JAKE: The UK, France, Australia, Mexico, all say they're going to investigate. ROBERTO: When it blew up, I had no idea the size of the situation. NEWS REPORTER 30: Panama Police have raided the offices of the law firm at the center of the country's massive data leak. JACK: Now the problem is can the various judicial systems of the world handle all of this material without getting a horrendous case of indigestion? JÃRGEN: We have always dealt with professional clients all over the world, only. RITA: After the publication, the example they gave it, we were like a knife factory, you know? We sell the knives. If people kill, kill other people with knives, it is not our fault. The problem is they always knew who had the knives and what were they gonna do with the knives. NEWS REPORTER 32: The law firm is denying any wrongdoing. RITA: When we'd realized how big it was was when we saw people going out in the streets. NEWS REPORTER 33: Thousands of Icelanders took the streets, calling on the Prime Minister to resign following allegations he benefited from offshore holdings and tax havens. NEWS REPORTER 34: The first casualty of the Panama Papers has fallen. Prime Minister of Iceland yielded his post on Tuesday amid public uproar that he failed to disclose links to an offshore company. NEWS REPORTER 35: Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, he may be thrown out of office over allegations that his family owned several illegal offshore businesses. CROWD: NEWS REPORTER 36: Corruption and bribery at the highest level on the streets of Rio Sao Paulo and dozens of other cities. Protestors laid the blame at the door of President Dilma Rousseff. MAN 8: Every day there is a new scandal. Every day there is something related to money being taken out of the country. NEWS REPORTER 37: We have some breaking news from Brazil where the senate there has voted to impeach President Dilma Rousseff and plunges the country into political chaos. KEVIN: Look at Brazil. That's probably the country where the Panama Papers has had the most impact. KEVIN: Iceland got the headlines with the president. The entire ruling structure of Brazil is crumbling because so many of them are tied into this money laundering scheme. CROWD: NEWS REPORTER 38: Protestors in the Argentine capital Buenos Aires are calling for the country's president to step down after the so-called Panama Papers revealed Mauricio Macri is on the board of two offshore firms: One in the Bahamas, the other in Panama. NEWS REPORTER 39: Several thousand people filled a square in Malta's capital on Sunday, and demanded the resignation of Prime Minister Joseph Muscat. MATTHEW: My mother was in Malta alone, fighting this with no, no one backing her at all. No institution. GERARD: Daphne had been working on a number of post-Panama Paper stories. She wasn't involved in the Panama Papers investigation itself, but she had taken our reporting and gone further. JACOB: KONRAD: Good evening. Um, today, the, yesterday's piece... KONRAD: There are no bank accounts, uh, no, no, no funds. KONRAD: And there are absolutely no funds. Thank you. MATTHEW: When the story broke, they didn't resign. I mean, I couldn't believe it. I could see, I mean, it was like a disaster unfolding in slow motion. NEWS REPORTER 40: British Prime Minister David Cameron faces backlash for implications in the recently leaked Panama Papers. JULIETTE: And that's when things in the UK just went really crazy. LUKE: There was turmoil in this country. David Cameron had the worst week. DAVID: Thank you, Mister Speaker. Thank you, Mister Speaker. With permission, I would like to make a statement on the Panama Papers. Dealing with my own circumstances first, yesterday I published all the information in my tax returns, not just for the last year, but for the last six years. I've also given additional information about money inherited and given to me by my family so people can see the sources of income that I have. This is an entirely standard practice, and it is not to avoid tax. JEREMY CORBYN: May I thank the Prime Minister for the advance site of his statement. It is absolutely a masterclass in the art of distraction. JULIETTE: He refused to say whether he had any money in his father's offshore fund. PAUL: He'd gone on record saying, we've gotta end secrecy about tax avoidance. He'd gone on record saying we've gotta shine a light on where this money comes from. DAVID: Some of these schemes where people are parking huge amounts of money offshore and taking loans back to just minimize their tax rates, it is not morally acceptable. PAUL: So he then had to come out, and this was the fourth or fifth explanation over a period of three days, saying, well, actually, I did benefit from the shares. DAVID: Samantha and I had a joint account. We owned, uh, 5,000 units in Blaire Moore, uh, Investment Trust, which we sold in January, uh, 2010. Uh, that was worth something like 30,000 pounds. Was there a profit on it? I paid, um, income tax on the dividends, but there was a profit on it, but it was less than the capital gains tax allowance, so I didn't pay capital gains tax, but it was subject to all the UK taxes in all the normal ways. WOMAN 3: A few months later, Britain was gonna hold a referendum on whether to leave the European Union. NEWS REPORTER 41: People of Britain have spoken, voting for a British exit, dubbed Brexit, with almost 52% of the votes choosing to leave the 28 member European Union. NEWS REPORTER 41: And Cameron was the figurehead for Romaine, but the British press is dominated by press barrons who wanted us to leave, and it suited their agenda to destroy the figurehead for Romane. DAVID: On Wednesday, I would attend the House of Commons for Prime Ministers, answer questions, and then after that, I expect to go to the Palace and offer my resignation, so we'll have a new Prime Minister in that building behind me by Wednesday evening. Thank you very much. PAUL: Cameron helped to create this moral atmosphere which said, look, this behavior is wrong and should not be helped by the laws that we have in existence at the moment. MAN 8: The documents show allies to Russian President Vladimir Putin secretly shuffled as much as $2 billion through banks and shadow companies. PAUL: Day one, of course, was Vladimir Putin and the two $2 billion worth of money that led back to him, which was a remarkable story. It's been one of international journalism's holy grails, really, that story. JOHN OLIVER: The papers revealed the identity of a suspiciously rich cellist, which raises immediate red flags for me, 'cause I always thought the only way to make millions with a cello is to use it to dig for gold. LUKE: You know, he's basically saying we're all spies. We scheme dastardly stuff to try and defame the Russian Federation. Now, of course that isn't the case, and if it were a CIA plot-- LUKE: --how come David Cameron got sucked in? How come demonstrations in Iceland and Argentina? JULIETTE: I mean the hilarious thing, you know, is that Putin ended up having to buy lots of cellos. Roldugin bought lots of cellos because he said it was for buying cellos, so they went and bought a lot of cellos after. MARISA: This wasn't on official news in Russia. Unless you were looking at foreign media, you had no idea that the Panama Papers broke. The officials who were implicated in these documents would retaliate against journalists. It's real. Journalists have been killed. NEWS REPORTER 42: A car exploded in flames in the Ukrainian capital of Kiev early Wednesday morning inside a prominent journalist, Pavel Sheremet. MAN 9: NEWS REPORTER 42: An eye witness to the blast says several people tried to pull Sheremet from the car, but it appeared he was already dead. LUKE: In Russia, journalists, um, both in the big cities and the provinces, get killed, shot, beaten to death. Roman Anin who works for Novaya Gazeta, he was kind of instrumental in, in chasing the, following the money all the way to Putin and making that kind of connection. FREDERIK: The Kremlin pretty soon found out who our Russia partners are, so there was TV programs that were, that basically screamed something like, "Wanted" posters of the two of them putting out information, um, on them, detailed information that could lead people to the place where they work or potentially where they live. They, to a certain point, left Russia for a while. RITA: We were treated as, uh, traitors. There were publications all over the social networks and everywhere blaming us for selling our country, blaming us for treason. Theywere people saying, "What should we do with a traitor journalist?" with our names. They said, well, should we throw them off the bridge of the canal? Should we send them to Punta Coco, which is equivalent of Alcatraz for Panama, or should we just send them to La Joya, which is a maximum security prison. JOSEPH: This sort of thing is happening a lot of, a lot of places in the world, it's absolutely terrifying. Me personally, I've been physically threatened, I've been threatened with lawsuits. Um, but I'm really lucky. I, you know, I work in the United States. It's really bad form to kill a journalist here. Investigative journalism is hard enough without having to worry, do all that kind of moral math, um, physical risk. It's something that war correspondents are used to doing all the time. In a way, it kind of feels like we're all war correspondents now. MARINA: This just shows how vulnerable reporters around the world working on corruption issues are. One answer to that vulnerability is working in networks and in teams. You can't take down 376 reporters. PRESENTER: For the Panama Papers, reporting that explored the hidden infrastructure and global scale of offshore tax havens... PRESENTER: The Pulitzer Prize and explanatory reporting goes to... The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, McClatchy and the Miami Herald. MARISA: Just the idea that we were able to-to finish the Panama Papers despite all of the doubts and publish it along with all of these other reporters all across the world. JÃHANNES: And it felt so surreal because the Pulitzer is something you always dream of as a journalist, but as a German journalist, it's something that you can normally not reach. GERARD: It's nice to show that journalists can actually work together, and I think that's something that we always thought would never happen. You know, journalists are selfish, we don't share stories, we don't share sources. We've just proven that that's wrong, that, in fact, you can get a better story sometimes if you do, if you do share. MAN 9: You do need big, international teams to cover big, international topics. KEVIN: Then it cleared the way for us to spend the rest of the year really doing the kind of stuff that you couldn't do on the first day, but were just as important as the first day stories. FREDERIK: I thought that this would be the time that we can refocus and go into the stories we hadn't yet the time to finish, but then we heard this terrible news from Malta where Daphne Galizia, um, was killed in a-a car bombing. NEWS REPORTER 43: The son of the investigative journalist, Daphne Caruana Galizia, who was killed in a car bomb attack in Malta has attacked the island as a mafia state run by what he called crooks. His 53-year-old mother, who was killed yesterday, was known for her blog accusing politicians of high-level corruption and she led the Panama Papers investigation into corruption on the island. MAN 10: We couldn't have been more shocked when-when we found out that Daphne, you know, Matthew's mother, had been blown up. I mean, it just seemed so senseless and-and crazy. MATTHEW: It was, the message was, look, we can, we can do this and we can get away with it. We have, there's no deterrent. We can strike whoever we want, whenever we want and get away with it. GERARD: The fact that she was killed in Malta, you're talking about a European country. That really shocked not just us, but also the world. JACOB: You know, this, what happened to Daphne, it-it never, we never thought anything could happen in Malta. Daphne was, you know, very much a, a fearless investigator. You know, a, a lone, a lone voice in a sense. She was very frustrated with-with mainstream media. I don't know. People just gravitated towards her blog naturally. JULIETTE: Daphne was fierce, and she was a blogger, so she had a lot more freedom than newspaper journalists in terms of expressing her opinion, and she used it. DAPHNE: My article went up at 7:00 in the evening, and two and a half hours later, by half past nine, the police are already at my gate with a warrant for my arrest issued by a magistrate within two and a half hours. The police cannot understand why I will not abide by the law and sit at home quietly and not write anything about politics. FREDERIK: She was one addressing things many politicians did not want to hear. She wrote about corruption at the highest levels of government. You know, I mean I always get, like, you know, the-the usual people, "Don't worry, the truth will come to light. Good always wins. There will be justice." My mother always thought that was bullshit. JULIETTE: She wasn't just outspoken. She was effective, and I think that's why she's-she's been killed. What was particularly shocking was that, for some people, um, this assassination was a-a cause of celebration. One police officer actually tweeted that he was pleased that this had happened and-and called her "cow dung" the day after, so you know, there wasn't universal condemnation of this act in Malta. Perhaps there should have been. NEWS REPORTER 44: A court in Malta has charged three men with the murder of Daphne Caruana Galiza. Maltase media say the authorities honed in on the suspects following telephone intercepts. Police arrested 10 men on on Monday in connection with the killing. Seven have been released on bail pending further inquiries. MAN 11: It was just all a big show. MATTHEW: I am quite confident that they were the people who executed the orders to assassinate my mother, but my mother never wrote about them, she never investigated them, she had no idea who they were. They've probably never even read what she wrote. JACOB: They may have the people who-who pushed a button, who-who, you know, who set off the bomb, but they're definitely not the masterminds, and they definitely, you know, wouldn't have had the motive to do it, so the big question is, you know, who ordered this kill, and ultimately, who paid them, as well? MAN 10: The way it was done, it was also a way of getting sources to stop talking. NEWS REPORTER 45: The two founders of Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca were arrested after both were indicted on charges of money laundering. ROBERTO: Porcell, I think, is trying to do what has to be done, but the judiciary, which is where she has to deposit her investigations, has zero credibility at this point. If you talk to Panamanians out there about this, the reaction is "No pasa nada"... Nothing will happen. I don't think that's right. I think that something will happen. We have an ex-president of the Supreme Court in jail. We have an ex-president in jail in Miami. I mean, there are things happening. I feel that somewhere along the way, in incremental bits, we'll be solving these problems. It's just a, a human problem that we have to face all over the world. FREDERIK: This is not only about Panama, that's a worldwide problem, and if it should get solved, it's something that has to be addressed in the U.S., as well. KEVIN: One of the things that led to change on the U.S. end that both Nevada and Wyoming changed their laws based on some of what we were able to show about these nominee directors that really weren't contacts. And the UK government is now supporting efforts to force transparency in overseas tax havens that do that by introducing public registries across the commonwealth countries. MARINA/EMILIA: WOMAN 5: Panama Papers hasn't ended yet. It's still going. Every week, there's a new Panama Papers development. Reporters are still in the database and are still searching and still finding things that we missed. MARISA: While there have been a lot of investigations launched, including in the U.S., and there have been a number of people all across the world who have been arrested, there has been an element of inaction in areas that really matter, reform that would prevent these offshores from being created in the way they are created. There was a lot of talk about it, but yet, that hasn't happened in a significant way. MAN 10: I think history has shown that as important as Panama Papers are in revealing this kind of underbelly of global finance and how it ties into the whole inequality question, I think it also will probably lead to a better mousetrap. GERARD: Will the scams go on? Will there be new ways found? Yes, of course. You know, they, it-it, you know, the world will probably just get a bit more sophisticated. MATTHEW: There's a democratic backsliding in the world in general, and I think that this is taking journalism down with it. It's kind of strange that, at that same time, it's a golden age for investigative journalism. Our work has never been as important as it is now. JOHN: But when it takes a whistleblower to sound the alarm, it is cause for even greater concern. It signals that democracy's checks and balance have all failed, that the breakdown is systemic, and that severe instability could be just around the corner.
