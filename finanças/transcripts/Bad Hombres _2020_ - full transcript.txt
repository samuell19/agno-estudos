Sparse guitar chords You have illegals that are just pouring across the border. Speaking Spanish They're sending people that have lots of problems. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. Speaking Spanish Secondary? Are you secondary? - He doesn't have a visa. - Oh, don't worry. I'ma go looking for it. But we have some bad hombres here, and we're gonna get 'em out. Build that wall. Build that wall. Build that wall! Build that wall! Build that wall! Build that wall! Build that wall! Mournful guitar music Between the Good Neighbor nations, the United States and Mexico, we can look down both banks of the Rio Grande over the vast lands of south Texas and the hills of Mexico. Nuevo Laredo, a border town carrying a reputation for catering to Texans with a little "south of the border" atmosphere. Every year, more than 200,000 Americans cross into Mexico. They find everything they want right here. But traffic on the international bridges is not one way. Mexican nationals account for 80 percent of the retail sales in Laredo. While in other parts of the world, there are demonstrations of force between nations, leaders from both sides of the river meet here every year for an exchange of greetings and a renewal of goodwill. Here, you're seeing a wonderful demonstration of international friendship. Mexican president Felipe Calder√≥n declared war on the country's powerful cartels. They toppled drug kingpins. Many shattered into smaller, ultraviolent gangs. Unfortunately, the United States has not been in complete control of its borders for decades, and therefore, illegal immigration has been on the rise. We have a responsibility to enforce our laws. We have a responsibility to secure our borders. Secure our borders with technology, personnel physical barriers, if necessary, in some places. The bill before us will certainly do some good and will authorize some badly needed funding for better fences and better security along our borders. I voted for a fence. I voted for 700-mile fence. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I'm Pete Saenz; I'm the mayor of Laredo, Texas. We're excited to have Mr. Donald Trump here in Laredo, Texas. It has provided us an opportunity to present to Mr. Trump and his entourage what Laredo's all about. But the crime along the border is down. What danger are you talking about? Oh, there's great danger with the illegals, and we're just discussing that. But we have a tremendous danger on the border with the illegals coming in. Yes, ma'am. Are you still in favor of a wall... - Oh, yeah. In-- - Across the entire border? In certain sections, you have to have a wall. Absolutely. Mr. Trump, what do you have to say... You're leaving? - Yeah. - Yeah? Speaking Spanish Both my parents came from Mexico. They came over at a young age, illegally, and then they got their green cards eventually and started working the agricultural fields, like a lot of people did. People wanna come to America and work and raise a family here. It's a great country. My mom's a citizen, and my dad's hopefully gonna become a citizen this year or next year. Oh, damn. - Ooh. - No, no, no. I'm not gonna say that there's not people that come over and cause trouble, 'cause, you know, with anything, you're gonna have some troublemakers in there, but the majority of the people that come over come over to here to work, make some money, and earn a living for their family. Speaking Spanish My dad has a little truck accessory shop. Always there, 365 days a year, you know. There's no Thanksgiving, no Christmas, and I know he would come home tired sometimes, but he would always have time to go out and hit batting practice with me. My dad and mom'll watch almost every single game of my games. They'll put the games on the computer and then watch it, like, every single night. Speaking Spanish It pushes you, you know. You see them going out there every day, and once you're younger, I guess you don't realize it, but when you get older, you really see it, you know. Parents are out there, working, working their butts off. So you just wanna do the same-- you know, follow their example. Let's see... Do the pledge. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Ernesto! Here, mister. Where you from? - I am from... Mexico. - Mexico? - What part of Mexico? - Mexicali. You like it here better? - Yes. - Okay, okay. You feel safer here. Yes. That's why you like it more. - Yeah. - That's good. It's more... but here is more, uh... it's more, um... I don't know. How do you say it in Spanish? I sub at a school where they really try to help out the kids that come from different backgrounds and are just learning the language. They need to learn English to get by 'cause that's the primary thing. Speaking Spanish I just like to have fun with them and I want them to learn and have a little bit of fun. Keenan, where are you from? Really? - You like it? - No. No? You miss home? Hey, months of the year. - March. - March. - What happens in March? - School. Spring training starts in March too. I start playing baseball in March. - Yeah? - I leave you guys. I'm on a-- I like you play. All right. Okay. Singing "Take Me Out to the Ball Game" in Spanish upbeat guitar music speaking Spanish The official return of the Tecolotes to the Two Laredos... Professional baseball is back in the Gateway City. This was truly a moment for celebration. Press announcements were had in two nations in two cities because the Tecolotes de Los Dos Laredos, Mexican League Baseball, made a brilliant comeback this past year... speaking Spanish ...the Tecos splitting their season between two nations and hometowns, the return of a time-honored tradition. Speaking Spanish speaking Spanish speaking Spanish - I made it fall. - All right! - All right, we ready? - Yep. Hang on tight. Hang on tight. You got me? Okay. Whoo! My name is Luis Flores. I'm 32 years old. Catcher. Play here with the Dos Laredos of Laredo, here in the Mexico League. The passion that I have for baseball-- shit, man, it's taken care of my family. It's got us a house. It's got us-- you know, put my kids and my wife under a roof. Babe, we need to shave my back. I am Mexican American, born on American side, but the food, the culture, and stuff like that, you know-- I grew up eating tacos. I grew up barbecuing. I grew up drinking Tecate Lights. There's some Hispanic blood in me. Hey, I forgot the ketchup, mustard, everything, Mandy. Being from Del Rio, a lot of the border towns, you get a lot of people from the Mexican side that know English and then vice versa. We go over there; we know our Spanish. - I'm here, I'm here. - Speaking Spanish - Yeah, thank you! - Speaking Spanish Watch his foot. Watch it. Grandpa, hold on! Hold on, Grandpa! And this year, it's been a little different story compared to my last two and a half, three years here in the Mexican League. In my past, I was in Monterrey. So it was kind of hard for me to get home because it's a little further, five and a half hours. But when I got traded over in Laredo, different story, you know? It's two and a half hours away from home. Easy drive. Speaking Spanish My big goals, baseball-wise: just staying healthy and enjoying it because I think this could be my last year. If I don't really have a chance to get back to the Major Leagues, I think it's pretty much-- you know, my time is up from playing ball. But I wanna keep going. And I could play another two or three years. I know I can. And good years. I mean, it's in me, you know? I still have it. Pensive music speaking Spanish What's up, trouble? Good seeing you, man. Speaking Spanish speaking Spanish Okay. All right, man. Speaking Spanish speaking Spanish Yeah. - Still alive. - Still alive, dog. Damn! It's my, what, tenth season? Spring training's a month long, and then the season's over a hundred games. It's just a long road. You kind of get used to it as a baseball player, but we're a team and we're a family. Speaking Spanish - Yeah. - Or no--yeah? - I will. We stick together, you know? It doesn't matter where you're from, if you're from Dominican, if you're from the U.S., Venezuela. We're a team. Our main goal is to win, you know, and those are my brothers. Speaking Spanish speaking Spanish Someone told me long ago There's a calm before the storm I know It's been coming for some time When it's over, so they say speaking Spanish speaking Spanish ominous music speaking Spanish speaking Spanish I heard a lot of things about here. It's not like other cities, where you can-- you just go out during the night like anyone else, you know? If it's late, the sun's down, I think about it twice before I go out. Oof! Speaking Spanish I think the main idea to live here is to, like-- to save money. Everything in general is cheaper over here. Life over there is kind of expensive. That's why we decided to come over here: to pay less money for a bigger apartment, have more money saved. That's the main point why we decided to live here in Mexico instead of Texas. Speaking Spanish The body count here continues to climb. Three more people were killed by drug lords last night. The border turmoil has turned the image of this Mexican town to pieces. Tourism has dropped by 90 percent. Drug violence is raging from Mexico's deep south to its northern border with the United States. I ran on a very simple slogan: make America great again. If you're gonna have drugs pouring across the border, if you're gonna have human traffickers pouring across the border in areas where we have no protection, in areas where we don't have a barrier-- very hard to make America great again. Oh, wow. It is super deep. My name is Tricia Cortez, and I'm executive director of an environmental nonprofit in Laredo called the Rio Grande International Study Center. Our organization started this program in the early to mid-'90s because at that time, the river was in a really rapidly deteriorating state. Let me know when you're ready, Manuel. The river is the number one asset in our community in so many ways. 8.28. It's sort of like this ribbon of life in a very semiarid, water-stressed region. Speaking Spanish It provides habitat for a lot of wildlife and animals, even livestock for ranchers. One down. Two to go. That wall is the single most important issue that is facing our community right now. You're destroying habitat. You're destroying access to the river. You are impacting ecosystems. Okay, Manuel, this is 0.35. And so I'm not really sure who that wall is for. A wall is not gonna stop people who are gonna come and claim asylum. The drugs are gonna keep coming through the bridges. I mean, who is the target of that wall? It's a symbol, right? And it's a dangerous symbol and it's a deeply undemocratic and un-American symbol. All right. Okay, we got everything done, Manuel? Making sure that we stop its construction is so important because the ramifications will be so profound for so long. It's something that the president needs for 2020, and it's a big flip of the finger to people south of us, and we cannot allow that to happen. Man, that sun. Just saw a shoe there. They get rid of their shoes and so forth. There's a little landing on the other side, on the Mexican side. There's a bucket there. You can't actually see it, but there's probably a little roadway on the other side. And you'll have a scout hide inside the brush right there, looking this way, trying to see if there's any activity. If they don't see any activity, then they give the go-ahead, and they'll just cross right on over. They can cross, walking through here without any issues, without any problems. This is ground zero for human smuggling, right here. About two weeks ago, the state police on the Mexican side engaged some cartel members right there by the railroad bridge. And you can hear all the actual gunfight going back and forth. Like, there's a train right now. That's a good indicator that there could be activity on this side. This white truck comes quite a bit. And I'll show you the scouts on the Mexican side. They're hiding in the brush. Check the LP for that Avalanche right there. That's a scout vehicle. Border Patrol's already calling us, letting us know that this-- they know that this is a scout vehicle. Six-four-five. I got it. Ten-four. - Your truck? - Yeah. - Speaking Spanish - No, sir. He has priors for predatorization. Yeah, okay. You're about to go wanted if you don't turn yourself in. Don't hang around in hot areas, especially if you know it's hot aqu√≠. You know, I already saw the priors that you got arrested for. It's a hot area. If you don't have to be in this area, there's other places, you know, where you can go fish. He has priors, uh, for smuggling. So... ...probably up to no good in the area. We need help and we need a solution. You know, our current president's solution is, "Build a wall. Keep them all out." And you can see why he would wanna build a wall. 'Cause there's-- we've got no protection. You build a fence around your house to protect it, and that's kind of like what he's trying to do with our country, and I agree with him. - I agree with him. - Ten-four. We're making contact over here by the riverbank with BP. Goodbye. It's a cat-and-mouse game. All that's keeping us safe in the United States is Border Patrol agents guarding this area here. A record number of families and unaccompanied minors are now trying to enter the U.S. The president today threatened drastic action if Mexico does not stop illegal immigration. And for the first time, he put a date on it. So there's a very good likelihood that I'll be closing the border next week. President Trump tonight ordering 750 additional border agents to the region. It is a drastic step, catastrophic, if the president shuts down the southern border this week. They're gonna stop them, and if they don't stop 'em, we're closing the border. They'll close it, And we'll keep it closed for a long time. I'm not playing games. - How you been? - Good. How are you? Let's go fishing. I never... Never fished? No, I never eat some fish... Oh, out of this river? Yeah. We usually walk across this bridge and then get picked up by a bus on the other side. Upbeat music - Where is it? - Right here. Sorta-- - It's here? - Yeah. Then we're running. Chattering in Spanish Okay. Speaking Spanish gentle guitar music The team's a little worried as a whole about the border being closed. A lot of us live on the Laredo side. We're probably gonna have to move to Nuevo Laredo and stay over there a couple days until things settle down. Hopefully, it doesn't happen, but that's-- it's a possibility. But the quality of bats, where we're putting-- pitching is good; we're healthy. That's the important thing. We're ready to go, you know. It's been a long spring training, and I think everybody's ready to get the season going. Speaking Spanish speaking Spanish We, just one day before opening day, have been in contact with the border authorities, with the city authorities from Laredo, saying, "What's going on? What will happen?" The worst case, if the border is closed, we have to play in Mexico. Speaking Spanish The team we're gonna be having our games against, they're in Mexico, so they won't be able to get here. We'll have to go back to Mexico and stay there till everything goes back to normal. President Trump appears to be backing down from his threat to close the U.S.-Mexico border. I mean, what is behind the president's pivot on closing the southern border? You know, from the Hill, from private business, from pretty much everyone, the message to the White House this week was "Don't do it." Clearly, the president not backing fully away from that, but saying it would not be immediate is definitely a relief for people here. Frankly, better but less drastic than closing the border is to tariff the cars coming in. And I will do it, just like-- you know I will do it. I don't play games. Let's go, Tecos! Play ball! Welcome to Uni-Trade Stadium! Bienvenidos. We are unique. We are special. M√©xico, United States of America, represented by the Tecos de Los Dos Laredos. This is the only international team. Speaking Spanish deep guitar music speaking Spanish speaking Spanish Where is he? You see him? Look, stand on the chair. You see him? Speaking Spanish Luis, I love you! Speaking Spanish speaking Spanish Dad! I don't need sunscreen. Says who? I'm gonna wash it off in the water. Are you? - Yes. - Hey. When I hit that ball yesterday... home runs like that, you don't really feel them off the bat, you know? It's just--you really don't. And I was thinking, "Man, please don't go foul." I was like, "God, I hope it don't go foul." But no, it stayed straight. So... when you perform well, you come out in the paper, you know? It's just--that's-- it's pretty much what it is. He did it! Yes! - Come and pick me up, Dada! - Swim over here. I didn't really get a chance to get an apartment here. So for the next six and a half, seven months, this is home for me. Logie, are you gonna get--oh! This is way better. - Yeah. - Wow. I told you! Oh. So--feels so good! This is what I needed. I try to take care of my body as best as we could as ball players... Oh, Dada's getting too old. ...from catching nine innings, from traveling with the type of situations that we're given. She shaved your back? She don't give me my back. She don't give me my vitamins or nothing. Don't get me wrong. I love playing. I've been doing this for the last 12 years, but it's getting tough on my wife. We would go to Yucat√°n if we're gonna just fly with you. But if we're gonna fly by ourselves, then we'll just go to Canc√∫n. - But I don't know. - Careful. - Stay on the stairs. - I think this year, it would be even harder. At home with a five-year-old, a three-year-old, and a one-year-old, and, man, she's a champ, you know? - That ain't easy. - I'm jumping in! At the end of the year, I would love to hit over 300, but it's hard to think about yourself when, in Mexico, you are trying to win a championship. Ah! That ain't no belly flop! Singing in Spanish When I was back in the States, spending my years in the minor leagues, it was all about development. But being over here, it's about winning, winning games from day one to day 122. - After your home run? - Mm-hmm. Oh, nice. Is that in English? Oh, yes. I wanna see. Does it say anything? Yeah. It says I need a new wife. Well, I think I need a new husband. So whatever. - See? - Oh. Damn. Oh, we got a trash can! A'ight! Getting better? - Yeah, no doubt. - No doubt. Does the water work? - What? - Oh, sure. - My hat? - Huh? Did you bring my hat? I didn't use your hat. - Who did? - Johnny did. Hey, what'd I do, Juan? - Huh? - What'd I do? You used his hat. Look. The one I use? Nice and washed. - Wow. - Oh. Speaking Spanish mild music speaking Spanish singing in Spanish sedate guitar music Tecos! Tecos! Tecos! Tecos! Speaking Spanish Well, we got a reminder in recent days that what U.S. officials call a crisis is a mixture of reality and also political stagecraft. Last week, President Trump threatened to close the border. That threat seized headlines just like his previous threats to do the same thing. Officials have now backed off that threat, at least for the moment. They say Mexico is stepping up to help with the influx of asylum applicants. Upbeat music It's a long grind. It really takes a toll. Your body gets tired. I'm a little used to it now, I guess. It goes with it. I love playing baseball. Speaking Spanish - Oh, we're already here? - We're here, bro. Somber music speaking Spanish See you later, guys. See you later, guys. Oh, we're not in... Oh, it's kind of warm in here. Oh, man. We can go into any of these. Yeah, let's just walk around. I'm saying, which one do you want? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. - Oh, my goodness. - Dude! Speaking Spanish They said, "What type are you looking for?" I don't know. I'm looking for some normal ones. Nothing too crazy. I just want some regular leather ones. I don't... I can't tell what kind of skin that is. Speaking Spanish Looks like a bird. No, no, that's just-- that's made in Mexico. That's just, like, the symbol. That's an eagle. Speaking Spanish - Those are pretty sick. - Speaking Spanish They're nice. Speaking Spanish It's very simple. We wanna stop drugs from coming into our country. We want to stop criminals and gangs, 'cause we have an invasion of drugs, invasion of gangs, invasion of people, and it's unacceptable. But we've done a fantastic job, but we haven't been given the equipment. We haven't been given the walls. You know, we just kind of resent that label. It makes it sound like we live in some lawless wasteland, and the changes would be so profound to our ranches, parks, nature trails, low-income, middle-income neighborhoods. So much that's at stake, and I'm getting emotional because this is one of the most lamentable chapters of border history that is happening right now. Hi, Joseph. It's Trish. How are you? I'm good. How about yourself? Good. I can just get onto Cuatro Vientos, right, and get off Mangana-Hein? Go right on Hein-Mangana. Yes. That avoids all the traffic. See you in just a little bit, Joseph, okay? - Okay. Thanks. - Okay. Bye. So Joe Hein, he owns a ranch. It's been in his family for about a hundred years, several generations, along the Webb County-Zapata line, which, you know, they're in the crosshairs for this wall, and so I think it's really good to get a firsthand, real-world account from somebody who lives on the river. Somber music Depends where they put the fence, but I'd have to have the animals on the other side of the fence, and then what scares me about that is, the ecosystem that they're hurting, it's gonna be affected forever, because once that thing is in place, it's gonna be really hard to destroy. So it's a monument to their stupidity. It's like we're giving the land... - Right. - Back to Mexico. I mean, he'll be the first president that ever gives U.S. soil to a foreign country. I don't know why this administration is picking the most difficult course of action to do something. Border Patrol came, and they asked me to put towers with cameras that could zoom in and zoom out, and it won't interfere with the wildlife. It won't interfere with the domestic animals. It's such a practical thing, and how effective it would be and how cost-effective it would be, because it's a lot cheaper than building a wall. Imagine trying to build a wall in this type of terrain. Hey, Ginger. What d'you have, Ginger? He lied to his base, and now he has to follow through on it. And the sad thing is that his base believes him. I mean, common sense. Ask the locals. You don't think if I was in danger here, I'd be the first one wanting a fence to protect my family and myself? Why are we against it? Because what he says and the picture that he paints, it's not true. It's a lie. The only rapist might be my stud, but that's about it. It's not dangerous. We're two communities that become one community, and the nation should be very proud of what they have here because it's unique. It's different. It's positive. We set an example as to what relations should be between nations. It's very much part of who we are. Energetic music After the win... No pressure. Just don't mess up. Just don't fuck it up. But look, it really hurt. Speaking Spanish What are y'all doing? - This is going to the border? - Yes! Aww, man. Speaking Spanish speaking Spanish Our bus driver, he hits the brakes hard. I felt like we were gonna tip over, like, five times. I love you! Chatting in Spanish It's a win! My boy! Winning! Speaking Spanish Johnny Davis. Speaking Spanish Let's go, Johnny. Go, Johnny! Oh. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Speaking Spanish All right, let's go. Hey, hey, hey. - Fuck that! - Hey! Hey! Listen to me! - Listen to me! - Fuck this game! He gotta see me after! After! Meet me in the parking lot if you want to! Speaking Spanish speaking Spanish speaking Spanish speaking Spanish The one that they threw? Watch this, bro. Ha-ha. No, no, no, no. Speaking Spanish Look at him! Look at him! Speaking Spanish upbeat music shouts in Spanish Whoo-hoo! Speaking Spanish speaking Spanish Bueno. It's always great to be around your teammates. Speaking Spanish I love to travel and see different places 'cause Mexico's a-- is a pretty neat country. So I go out and try to explore as much as I can. This is actually pretty nice. See a lot of different things that--unique things, you know, that I wouldn't get to see in the U.S. Grasshopper? Oh, is this them? Try one of them. Speaking Spanish What's it taste like? He doesn't like them. Speaking Spanish Ah! Man, after every game, you're packing your bag. Finish your game in Mexico; you pack your bag 'cause they're bringing you back to the U.S. Pack your bag again. They take you back to Mexico 'cause you're playing in Mexico the next day. Just plug the PlayStation in. It's gonna... Walking across every day. They drop us off at the border. You walk back. You get tired. You get tired of it. You know what? It's at home already. - It's already connected. - Okay. All right. Take care. I love you. You know the next day, we have a game. It's--that game is not gonna get canceled because we're tired or because we're-- or got in late or because we couldn't sleep. Like, you know, that's out of your mind. You gotta hit in 110-degree weather. There's no choice. That's just our job. But it's probably one of the best grinds, though. No one said it was gonna be easy, um, and for those who make a living, you know, doing that, there's really no time to think. Speaking Spanish upbeat music And after that hole in one, under for the day. And now teeing off on this par four. It was a foul tip that I fouled off my own bat, but I guess I turned my head and hit me, you know, right on the side. Right away, it-- everything went blurry, kind of dizzy, and the-- it was hot, and that was probably what made it worse. Took me 13 seconds to respond. First--first thing my wife-- my wife said is-- when she walked in that hospital room, it wasn't, "Hey, how are you feeling?" Or "Hey, how"--you know, "Are you doing okay?" Gave me a big old hug. Her first words were, "You see? I told you you're getting too old." Somber music You know, in my head, I'm like, "Well, I am 32," but then I started thinking, "Well, I'm having probably the best year of my career." You know, you're supporting the family because of--of how well I'm doing. It makes me want to stay in it a little longer. What luck. What... oh! But I've been offered a job coaching freshman baseball at the high school in my hometown. I don't want to retire. It's hard, you know. Maybe if I was hitting .180 or... or striking out, you know, and not doing well, a lot easier. - God! - Ooh, that was, uh--that was very close. But it's hard to turn down because I finally got that opportunity, you know? But the thing is, I have to start in August, so it's gonna cut into the season. To do that, that ain't easy, you know, but... So... that's--that's gonna be a tough decision. Speaking Spanish speaking Spanish speaking Spanish dramatic music The Department of Homeland Security says the number of undocumented immigrants in their custody is at a crisis level, with holding facilities overflowing, mostly with families and children. Customs and Border Patrol have been forced to begin releasing large numbers of aliens into the United States. The increase in family units is a direct response to the vulnerabilities in our legal framework, where migrants and smugglers know that they will be released and allowed to stay in the U.S. indefinitely. It's a big, fat con job, folks. Walls work, folks. We need the wall. And who's gonna pay for the wall? Mexico! Who's gonna pay for the wall? Mexico! Who's gonna pay for the wall? Mexico! What's up, Flo? Hey, dude. What's up, dude? How you feeling? Better, way better. Yeah? Back to normal? - Doing all right? - Yep. Ready to go, Bubba. I think if I would've said no, I probably would've been divorced by my wife. It was a decision that needed to be done, decision that I made. Speaking Spanish I was hoping I could finish the year and try to help them, you know, go as far as they can. Speaking Spanish In my mind, I'm like, "All right. How am I gonna tell these guys?" You know, "How am I gonna tell these guys that July Fourth is my-- is my--is my last game?" Speaking Spanish And the home Of the brave At this time, it is with great pleasure to thank the Tecos baseball organization and U.S. Customs and Border Protection Office of Field Operations. Dos naciones, un equipo. Two nations, one team. Ladies and gentlemen, please turn your attention to the right field fence, where the Laredo Police Department SWAT team will secure the field. Every day around our nation and around the world, the men and women of U.S. Customs and Border Protection Field Operations are on the front lines, ensuring the physical and economic security of the United States. We defend our borders from terrorists, smugglers and traffickers, and other criminals. On a typical day, CBP secures the flow of more than a million travelers. Most are law-abiding, but some travelers are not law-abiding, and we root them out through the use of professional judgment, keen instincts, and state-of-the-art technologies. The asylum program is a scam. Some of the roughest people you've ever seen, they read a--a little page given by lawyers that are all over the place. You look at this guy, you say, "Wow, that's a tough cookie! I am very fearful for my life." "I am very worried that I will be accosted if I am sent back home." No, no, he'll do the accosting. We don't love the fact that he's carrying the flag of Honduras or Guatemala or El Salvador, only to say he's petrified to be in his country. We started seeing last year caravans of migrants from Central America moving through Mexico into the U.S. In May, Border Patrol called Laredo Sector for help. Speaking Spanish They don't have any money. They haven't eaten. They don't have any food. Kids are starving. As you can see, a lot of people come in with nothing but just their clothes on their backs. Somber music speaking Spanish I can't imagine the conditions in which these people live in their--their own countries. They wouldn't be making this journey if they didn't have to. Being in--in Tijuana, we had that wall right there, it just feels like-- feel like you're in a cage. In my opinion, like, for instance, Laredo, I mean, if they want to build the wall, go ahead and build the wall. A lot of people don't like it. A lot of people do like it. I mean, build a wall in Laredo and split up the two cities, I mean, the wall's gonna make things, I think, feel a little different. It will. But, uh, those two communities, you're not gonna split them up, you know. There's a lot of people that have family on both sides. When you spend some time in Laredo, you realize, you know, like, how connected those two communities are. We play in, uh, Laredo. - Oh! - Well, we play on both sides. - Yeah? - I'm from Bakersfield, so... Oh, no, I grew up in Bakersfield. - Really? - I did. No way. I went to South High School. - My high school! - No way. - Yeah. - Are you kidding? Kind of just proves that the wall's not gonna separate communities, you know? People are gonna... they're gonna stick together. So y'all get to work on the Fourth of July too. Yeah. I think it doesn't matter to the people that are coming in, but they're gonna have a hot--hot meal. Speaking Spanish Nearly 250 years ago, a volunteer army of farmers and shopkeepers risked life and limb to secure American liberty and self-government. Now we must go forward as a nation with that same unity of purpose. Gracias. Praying in Spanish The future belongs to the brave, the strong, the proud, and the free. We are one people chasing one dream and one magnificent destiny. And we are all made by the same almighty God. O say Can you see By the dawn's Early light speaking Spanish somber music It's my last game of my career. I told my wife and my parents, "You might wanna, you know, bring the kids," and stuff like that. Luis Flores! My parents went up, my sister. They were all there, and-- and it was truly a--an amazing experience. Speaking Spanish It was probably better off for me. Not that I didn't want to say bye, you know, because, you know, eventually, I'm gonna call every one-- every one of those guys on that team, you know, and talk to them. But it was-- it would've been a hard-- a hard situation. Speaking Spanish You develop relationships with those guys. You're with them 24-7. And you just--you--it's-- it's amazing how close you become just because of the game, the game of baseball. It's--it's just--really, that's what it's about, man. This team was really special. Dada! Da! Dada! Da! The spirit of American independence will never fade, never fail, but will reign forever and ever and ever. To every citizen throughout our land and those who are making possible the amazing fireworks display, have a glorious Independence Day. Have a great Fourth of July. We are Americans, and the future belongs to us. God bless you, God bless the military, and God bless America. Happy Fourth of July. Shouting in Spanish The city of Nuevo Laredo, which hugs the border of south Texas, is the latest hot spot in Mexico's violent drug war. The onslaught of violence has choked the city with fear. Over the past two weeks, over 70 people have been killed there in drug-related violence. Speaking Spanish speaking Spanish speaking Spanish Bye. Somber music Most of the people now is not going out in the evening. Most, uh, business in the city are closing earlier. The trouble is, Nuevo Laredo is under the tight grip of the Zetas drug cartel. They have lookouts everywhere. For locals, even uttering their name is taboo. Let's, uh--hey. Speaking Spanish speaking Spanish Panic in El Paso this morning when a day of shopping turned into horror with an active shooter on the loose... Run! Run out that way! Run out that way! ...shoppers rushing out of Cielo Vista Mall and the Walmart Super Center next door, where bodies were seen lying outside... ...others choosing to hide from the danger. The shots were going... ...this busy Texas shopping center becoming the latest mass shooting less than a week after the last one. Someone drove a long distance to go down there to shoot up a Walmart in El Paso. I guess they're targeting Hispanics. I know there's a lot of people that--that died during that mass shooting. People are coming from all over the place to be a part of this-- this great country, and it's just sad, sad news. Disquieting music We're going to be signing today and registering national emergency. It's a great thing to do. And we will then be sued, and they will sue us in the Ninth Circuit, uh, even though it shouldn't be there, and we will possibly get a bad ruling, and then we'll get another bad ruling, and then we'll end up in the Supreme Court, and hopefully, we'll get a fair shake. Relaxed guitar music Okay, so do we want to start our meeting? - Yes. - I think a lot has happened since we last got together, so, you know, I just wanted to sort of touch base with you all and kind of see what-- what are you all thinking? Like, what are you all seeing? Like, what--what is something that we can do now? Um, I think our first phase was to, uh, really attack the declaration of a national emergency, uh, and I guess... We formed a coalition called Where's the National Emergency because we really were scratching our heads trying to figure out, "What national emergency is he talking about?" Part of the problem is lack of transparency, right? They're not-- they don't give you a list and say, "This is what we're planning to do. It just does not make sense to take that amount of money, billions of dollars, from the military to build something so monstrous and intrusive where it is not needed because Congress told him no. We need to educate the public as to what the facts are, and informing them with the facts, then we--we give them the tools to make proper, informed decisions. My question is, who is the public? Everybody. E-everybody, everybody. But--but who is everybody? Everybody that has the capacity to vote. - We talked about... - We're quickly trying to find a way to take legal action to try to get onto some kind of national lawsuit to challenge this. And the DHS answered to the lawsuit. They said Laredo is a-- a top priority. We're also trying to gather a group of people who really care about this issue in Laredo and try to figure out, "Well, how do we mobilize against this, and how do we get the word out?" So maybe August is the time where we need to have something-- Well, we can just--we can have, like, a town hall, and then we can have, like, a-- like, a really public event. And then have a march to the museum. - Yes! - Yeah, yeah. Awesome. They want 127 miles of wall to get built along our river, just 30-foot-tall steel slab bollard walls, and it's going to change profoundly our way of life. To bring up all the issues, right? It's ridiculous. It's not gonna work. It's obscene. It's a waste of money. This is not something that we're gonna take lying down. Speaking Spanish speaking Spanish relaxed guitar music There we go. Look at that. Oh, shit! Wow. Oh, my God! Man. Singing in Spanish It's getting ugly now. Jeering in Spanish speaking Spanish Oh, shit. Oh, man, I needed one of those. Viva M√©xico. Damn, man, we're out here grinding, battling through shit, dude. Okay, I feel like today we're starting to get--okay. Things are starting to look good, okay. Boom, something happened. It's like, "Oh, fuck. Back to square one." Yeah, again, dude, it's like flat tire after flat tire, dude. We're professionals, aren't we? We still gotta fucking pick each other up, you know? Like, it's still a fucking team. Speaking Spanish Miss it! If only you could play baseball like this. Damn! Hey, I'm gonna hit it, boom, boom. No. Ah! You talk too much. Oh! Soft music Yes! Goal at the beginning of the season is to make playoffs. You know, we've had a couple of injuries, been a lot of ups and downs, and we're just trying to bail it out. We're a little low on pitching, but we have enough to get it done. How? Where do you want me to hit? Hit--hit some pins. Quit missing all of them. No! Fuck. That's the good thing about this time of year. You know, you hope to be in it, and we're still in it. We got a series against Saltillo left. We have to win three games. It's the biggest one of the year. We're down to the wire, you know. We're just hoping for a little bit of luck at the end and see what happens. Are you nervous? No, I mean, we're still alive. In a sweep. - Saltillo? - Saltillo. Oh, no. No! Welcome, everybody, uh, to our town hall meeting. My names is Carlos Flores, and this is Tricia Cortez. We are, uh, two people that are part of a larger coalition uh, that has been fighting for--or, uh, most of this year to try to stop Donald Trump's racist wall in our community. You know, we understand Border Patrol has a job to do, but we need to find a better way. That's why we're all here. That's why we care so much. This is not a military zone. What the president is doing is illegal, and Congress needs to act to stop it. And Mayor Saenz is here, but tonight would be an excellent time to perhaps ask him also, so you all know. Thank you. I was just waiting for the opportunity. Good evening. I can see the passion, also, that y'all have, and of course, we-- we have that too. Uh, for years, it's been our position that we don't want the wall. Then you have to act. Not being against it and adopting resolutions and saying we have no choice... ...is different from taking a stand. The town hall meeting was a pretty important event for us. Our position has been that if the federal government is gonna impose and if they're gonna win, we have alternatives. As of yet, we haven't seen a successful lawsuit. I will argue that everybody thought that we were gonna lose cases like Dakota Access, and we won those cases. It was the first time that we've really took a very public step forward to create awareness and visibility about this issue and to stress the sense of urgency. City, city council, mayors. How dare you? It's my property. Don't play with my property for your benefit. - Okay. - Be fair. I respect your opinion, sir. I truly do. I'm a landowner. But it's not an opinion. - Represent everybody fair. - We the people! The goal was to get our elected officials on board with us. We don't get our land back. We won't get our water quality back. There is no end to our loss. It's been total silence on the part of our elected officials, and so for us, that is not acceptable. Whether it's legally or whether it's making a lot of noise and pressure, that's what we're gonna have to do. It's not really a question, but thank you for giving us some type of hope. Keeps my faith in humanity. Uh, racism has no rights in a diverse society. Thank you. Somber music Hey, let's go, guys! Hey, hey. Speaking Spanish uneasy music Activity picks up at this time. What I try and look for is movement in the brush. What they'll do is, they'll dig themselves into the grass, especially in this area here. They'll--they'll literally dig into it and hide. Speaking Spanish speaking Spanish I got you, I got you on, uh, our, uh, radio. He says that they're still in the banks, that they're waiting for them to come out. So... And they're gonna wait for nightfall. Speaking Spanish dramatic music At the bottom by the railroad bridge. Ten-four. Six-four-five. Ten-four. They might try and make a run for it since we have all the activity here. Speaking Spanish energetic music They went back from here, then. Yeah. I think where they're fishing is where they're at. Yeah. 'Cause those are the lookouts. Speaking Spanish light guitar music singing somber Spanish song His bag? It's right there. Chatting in Spanish speaking Spanish Fucking blew it, man. Wasn't our time, boys. Maybe leave-- maybe leave, like, at five o'clock. Fuck! Hard to believe, though, ain't it? First time in this league, I don't make playoffs. - Man. - Second time in my career. Um, we're getting close to the wall here. The wall's gonna come up through Mexico. A lot of traffic through here 'cause you're--the-- lot of 18-wheelers coming from Mexico and stuff. That house that just sold? Yeah. I just met them at Perkins. - Really? - Yeah. They're from Michigan. This is our wall right here. You used to be able to get through Mexico through here, but you can't anymore. Nice, right? Gentle music My kids are, uh-- they're really--they're really attached to me now. I've been enjoying this time off, really. It's been awesome. Remember, we're gonna get-- Hey, I might hit the jackpot, then! That's funny. Oh, that machine-- what's it called, that machine? - The bowler. - The bowler machine, that-- I'm gonna hit jackpot. It was tough when I-- when I left, but I'm home now, and being here with my kids, man, that's helped a lot. Waking up to them, uh, I can see the difference already in them. It's really brought our family closer together. This is Mexico and U.S. Starting this new chapter in my life. I tell you what. I-I have-- I haven't looked back. Speaking Spanish speaking Spanish speaking Spanish speaking Spanish speaking Spanish speaking Spanish speaking Spanish speaking Spanish speaking Spanish speaking Spanish - You ready or what? - Yeah. You're gonna wear red? What's wrong with red? Damn! I ain't scared. What? Speaking Spanish You're gonna wear that one? I ain't scared. What's up? I love baseball. I love playing it. But once the season's over, I like to relax and just watch my baseball games, you know? I become a fan. That's mine. It's kind of just in case. Growing up, my dad and mom spent a lot of time together watching the baseball games, and it's always-- always a good time. Okay, let's go. Let's go, my friend. Where you at, mouse? Let's roll. I don't know if I'll settle down here in Bakersfield or not. I eventually want to get married, have kids-- in the future, though. I'm not ready. Speaking Spanish I would love to stay with the Tecos, play another two or three. That'd be awesome. This year, I came back, and I felt pretty good. Body feels good. But I know I'm towards the end of my career. That's for sure. We'll see. We'll see what happens. Mr. President, the agents and employees of the U.S. Border Patrol are the tip of the spear proudly defending America's borders. We would like to present you with this piece of the first 30-foot border wall installed along the United States border with Mexico. Honor first. United States Border Patrol, El Centro sector, April 5, 2019. It's beautiful. Thank you. Thank you, Gloria. So thank you very much. Thank you. - It's a heavy piece of wall. - Yes, it is. Yes, it is. Thank you. We live on the border, and we understand that there are issues, but it just doesn't make any sense to us. I view this as a community with a border going through it. People come and go. Families interact. Education, communication, trade. This area really makes America more American. And we have all these horrible laws that the Democrats will not change. They won't change them. And I think they're gonna pay a very big price in 2020. They want to have open borders. Think of these people. Suppose they're gonna say, "Let's have an open border." They'll flood your houses, they'll shoot you, they'll take over your house, they'll take your car, and they'll... probably stay there. Why not? Speaking Portuguese You know, a lot of times, people, they feel that the border wall will--will protect us, save us, and will lock those people out, but it's really locking ourselves in. It's one of the most un-American things that we can do. The system is full. Our area's full. The sector is full. Our country is full. When it's full, it's full. We don't have room. Can't take you anymore. I'm sorry. Can't happen, so turn around. That's the way it is. I love coming here. I have bragged about how patriotic Laredo is, a city that is 96 percent Hispanic. That's a-- a source of great pride. To be that proud of heritage but deeply patriotic is an all-American idea. Whether you're with us or not, we're gonna move forward, and we're gonna be making some noise, and we're gonna work and do whatever we can to halt this madness. Chatting in Spanish What was that? Come on, you fucking... I love you, man. Speaking Spanish Last one of the year. Last cross of the year. Country guitar music
