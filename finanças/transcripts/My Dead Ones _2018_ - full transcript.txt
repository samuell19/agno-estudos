It's funny that it ends like this. But, after all... I'm feeling good. I'm David. I'm twenty years old, I live alone, in downtown. And... I've always liked cameras. This idea of being able to register an image on a machine forever. I think of myself as an... observer. And what draws my attention? I can't tell. But part of being an observer is going deep into the object that attracted your gaze and... find out more about it. The observer's first rule, and perhaps the only one, is to remain invisible. And I'm not ashamed of it. Because I know that ... I'm not the only one. It's really scary. Although things may sometimes seem inexplicable or even rather gruesome, the story of this young man is nothing more than a reflection of his childhood, of his emotional needs. "We were born to attend to our instincts, but the world does not allow us." Does anyone know who says this? Can I borrow your sharpener? - I'm sorry... - OK, that's enough for today. You've been very distracted, David. It won't happen again. Damn, I'm sorry. I didn't see your camera there. That boy over there. David! David! Hey! That camera shamed you, David. People kept laughing at you. What do you want, Thomaz? Do you know what I was talking with Marcos just now? What are the standards for entering this college, huh? To get a scholarship here. No, really, I do not know. And nowadays there are affirmative actions thrown in everything, right? I wonder if they offer affirmative actions for faggots, too. What do you hide, David? Tell me. Take that weight off your back. Maybe I can help you. Maybe... I think I didn't hear it right, speak louder. Maybe... I do hide something. And you should be afraid. Go away! Go away, David. David, go away! You're dead. Go, David. Come on, let's go. PLATO'S PHAEDO So you know what Plato thinks about death. Sorry, I haven't gotten to this part of the book yet. OK, I guess that wasn't a good way to start a conversation. I'm Jonatas. - Pleased to meet you. - David. Funny... You're reading the same book as me. Really? I'm reading it for my master's degree. I transferred this college and... I'm updating myself, reading some things, attending some optional disciplines... - So... You're not from here. - No. And neither are you. Huh? It's just that I'm good at recognizing outsiders. I think that's... another thing we have in common. If... if you ever need help with your master's degree... Well, thank you... But actually I'm the one who needs to apologize for that day. Your camera... I owe you one. And I owe you a pencil sharpener. Yeah, it looks like a fair trade. But there's no problem. It needed to be replaced anyways. You always do this? - What? Throw cameras? - No, film people. - Sometimes. - Hidden. Why? When people are distracted, they... They show more. What's inside of them. - That's it. - Did you film me? And did you find out anything? Not yet. So you'd better keep trying. C'mon, David. Gotta go. Hey. Wow! Your cheek is redder than usual, David. - Thomaz Stra... Stravs... Stravsinski... Inski? What kind of fucking name is this? This is the name of someone who'll inherit a lot. I wanna see how you're going to keep your cute little nose when he finds out. - Nah, he won't find out. - He won't? It will appear in his account statement as if it were a bank fee. Every month a little bit... And I doubt he checks his account statement. You're insane... I'm afraid you might create a new deep web with those skills. Yeah... I'd rather make a film about it. - Order for you, I need you to sign here. - OK. This is Ms. Maria. It's been a year since I moved here and she does nothing but stare out that window. She must be autistic. Or something like that, I don't know. But hope she knows how to make coffee. Something tells me to try to contact. Let's see. Can you feel it? Turn the service light on, please. Well, for those who asked for the composition of this semester's grades, we'll indeed have our already traditional photography seminar. Calm people, what is this? I'm not bringing only bad news. This time, the theme will be the human face. So you'll have to shoot on film and get your own prints. But, you'll be able to work in pairs. Come on, get your pairs! - He's already with me, Julia. - Sorry, we've already talked about it. Okay. I'm serious David, I think you could be a model. You have a hell of a potential. That's what I heard before an old man tried to stick his hand in my zippers. Be careful. Ana is horny. As long as she can't take a taste out of you, her pussy won't stop blinking. It'll blink right on your face, Caio. The bathroom is right after the dark room. Hold that, David. Don't let it touch this floor full of pubes. - Now I can resume filming you. - David isn't David without a camera. - So? Is it good? - Yeah, it's good. Shoots in 4K. - Done. Let's go? - Let's. Hold on. There's a place I want to show you. Whew, Caio will kill me tomorrow, thinking I was kidnapped. Nah, he won't. - What place is this? - Here's my secret place. It was called the Square of God. People say miracles happened here. - This place's the one which needs a miracle. - Apparently a man died here. He was murdered, and soon afterwards his wife killed herself. Then the miracles stopped. No one knows who did it... But people say it was the devil. Then the square was abandoned. - Are you filming? - Yep. - Hey. Sleep well? - What's this? This is Sofia. She had just been run over when I found her. Are you taking care of her? I always came here to relax... To look at the stars... Then after I found Sofia, she keeps me company. - She's really cute. - She's kinda shy, but very smart. - Just like you, David. - I'll take that as a compliment. - But she looks kinda sad. - I think that her little wing is gone. She must have some infection. Yeah, she doesn't look well. I don't think she'll last long. Freedom of the matter, as our friend Plato would say. She's free now. Freedom of the matter, as our friend Plato would say. She's free now. Freedom of the matter, as our friend Plato would say. She's free now. Hi. I'm your neighbor David. Sorry to barge in like that... Um... Can I come in? Can I sit down? I guess so. Are you... in need of anything? You're not much of a talker, huh? I used to be like that. But I'll tell you, it improves over time. That photo is nice. It's weird, but... I don't have a photo like that. Of my family, I only remember my mother. I tried to memorize their faces every morning in the shelter. My father, my uncle... But, from day to day, they became more fogged. Until the day came when it was as if they had never existed. The doctor said it was because of what had... - Mom! Of what had happened to me. But today I think it was for the best. Yeah, if I had to forget, there must have been a reason. But I know that... I'll remember them someday. What do you keep staring out of that window? There's nothing there, only... The street. I'm ready, David. What did you say? Everything will be fine. You're up early today. You were asleep so I took the opportunity to tidy up your wardrobe. Now it looks good. Come and have your breakfast. Sit down and I'll serve you. My grandmother used to say that, to make a good impression, you should serve tea for your guest. It's already sweetened. Here's the plate. I made you some cake. If you like, I'll put it in a jar and you take it to your college friends. I've heard that Caio loves carrot cake. He does. We always grab some at the cafeteria. God, I love this cake! Liked it? I thought you were so scrawny. What happened? I've pruned it. So that the new plant can be born. Why are you here? The why's of things are nonsense. What matters is that I feel great here. And I'll take good care of you. You called for me, didn't you? Here I am. Good thing. Just a second. Here... So, you'll take this, you'll turn the white screen on... Take it... Put the film reel above it... Take the phone... Give it to me... Turn the camera on. Take the photo, send it to Photoshop... And it's done. Photo scanned. Dope. So, what will this cost me? It's fine, you owe me one. So... Are you hungry? Holy shit! God, thank you. I was checking that YouTube channel, the guy was discussing the best ways to dispose of a body. It seems that fire's still the best pick. Hold on, you learned about disposing of a body on YouTube? Yeah, I did. You can find everything there, you should start a channel. People are profiting off it. Money! Oh, fuck! Almost forgot it. Are you still insomniac? No. Don't come with your melatonin bullshit, that crap's made of flour. This is not the dirty water you're used to. This is Propofol. It's a bang on the head. I'm serious. You'll really black out. Those guys use it in surgery, heavy shit. I've heard it was what killed Michael Jackson. Dope, huh? Just follow my instructions, no overdosing. Take it. Take it, David. Test it and tell me. Ah, I wanna be your supplier, huh? - Five drops? - Yeah - Okay. PHAEDO'S SALVATION Take it. It's a gift. Have you noticed that every great filmmaker has one of these? Here you will be able to write down your ideas, your dreams... I used to have a diary. It made me feel great. What's this? Somewhere in that little head of yours, you'll remember these people. But I'm not recognizing... Wait! This one even looks like you. How had I not noticed this video before? Things appear... At the time they have to appear. You look just the same. You have to meet them again. They're waiting for you to call them back. How? You know how. Accident with a drunk driver causes his own daughter to have her leg amputated. Carlos Abreu got six months in jail. His daughter Doris... Doris... Doris Abreu, daughter of taxi driver... Central Bookstore... ATTENDANT IN CENTRAL BOOKSTORE Blue Fleet Taxi... Blue Fleet Taxi... Hello? Hey... My grandma forgot... Some medicines in one of your cars... She told me the name of the driver. It's... Carlos Abreu. Yeah... Can you... Give me his number? Okay, thank you. Bye. - How is it going? - Fine... Where are we heading, sir? You can take the 23rd and then I give you the instructions. - Is that your wife? - This one? - Yes. - No, it's my daughter. She's only 19. - Very beautiful, your daughter. - Just like her mother. Her mother... Your wife? I never got married, no. You're a man too, you know how things are, right? It just happened. She just got enrolled in college, architecture. - Really? - Yeah. I... I study architecture. By the way, the office where I work is hiring interns. Wow. What luck, huh? - Yeah. - But... But would you like to put her forward for the job? Can I get your number? Sure, I can give it to you. - It's Pedro, right? - Yeah. She'll be happy, you know? What a lucky day! - Goddamn! - Lucky day... Hey, how you doing? Anything I can help you with? Yeah, yeah, I was just looking for an architecture book to give as a gift. Anything in particular? Actually, if you have someone who could recommend me one. Just a minute, I'll get you an expert. Doris, can you help a man here looking for an architecture book? Oh, Sure. Hey. So, an architect will be graced with a book? Yeah, actually, a student. Oh, nice. Follow me, I'll show you some options. Look, this is Paulo Mendes da Rocha, one of my favorites. Nice, I've always liked to visit the National Sculpture Museum. Oh, you know him. So you'll agree that it's a great gift. Yeah, a perfect one. It's... A little bit expensive, right? It's because few have this book. But I think it's worth it. Do you have it? The book? No, look at my face. I'd die for this book. So I think you're okay with going to have a coffee with me. This way we're even. Coffee... Sorry, I can't. - I'm sorry... - You can pay right over there. Hey, come here! Come, right here. Hungry, huh? Here, for you. Hey, David. Another one skipping class. Yeah, I came here to... Do some research. You've been weird since the last time we talked. Is everything okay? Yeah, I've changed my medicine. And you? What are you doing here? So, let me tell you. I'm seeing this guy, we're meeting each other, and I came here to buy him something. - Got it. Nice. Good luck, I gotta go. I'm in a hurry. - Bye. - Bye. Hey. - Hi. - I... Brought you something. For me? Yeah, a very reliable seller recommended it. She said it was a nice gift. Are you serious? Wow... Thank you. I'm Pedro. We couldn't introduce ourselves properly the last time I saw you. Oh, my pleasure. I'm Doris. And... Am I worthy of that coffee now? I was going to have lunch. Wanna join me? Sure. - Been waiting long? - Nah, I'm good. Didn't find it. I'm not finding the cellphone, not finding keys, anything... I'll handle this shit later. C'mon. - Wanna see something cool? - Yeah. - Here... - What's this? - That camera over there. Wave. - How do you do that? - It's not as difficult as it seems. If the pc that handles the camera is connected to a network, I can control it. It's like one system breaking the other. - Oh, so you're a hacker, or something? - No, it's more like a hobby... I also have a hobby. It's not cool like yours but... Photos. Architecture stuff, no big deal. I can show you some things. I love filming. I really do. In fact, I know this beautiful, secret place. Abandoned. It has the best light I've ever seen in my life. But... You'd have to see me again. What else I don't know about you? When I was a kid I wanted to be a ballerina. Well... Yeah, my dad played the piano and I danced. But, anyways, things change, dreams change. And.. What happened to you? Four flips with the car, then it stopped because there was a lamppost on the way. I was with my dad, he had... He was drunk, anyways... It took me ten years to talk to him again. Good thing that you do it now. He was sick... No, but now he's fine. Now he treats himself, now he quit drinking. He just didn't went back playing the piano, yet. Funny... You remind me a lot of someone. Your way, I don't know. Someone I liked very much. Really? Who? My cousin. You have... The same... The same eyes. We were best friends as kids. Before my new leg. You... Were? Yeah, he died... Went missing... From what I know. I only have parts of the story, I was very young. What was his name? David. Why? Nothing. I mean... I'm sorry. I hope you can see each other again one day. Thanks, but I don't think I want this to happen. He wasn't that great. Sorry, I don't really like this story. In fact, it seems that I only told you sad stories. No, no... Actually, those are the ones that interest me the most. What time is it? I think I have to go. Thank you, okay? For the book. Doris, I wanna see you again. Okay. Oh, take a look at page 111 later. I left something there for you. - 111? - No, no, not now. Calm down. You can see it later. Thanks. Doris. You'll be dancing again someday. Did you get the camera? And the memory cards? Take a sweater. He's here. Godspeed. You can stop there, it's already here. Should I wait here? - I want to have a talk with you. - Huh? Have a talk with me? What's this? Here. Do you recognize this person? Where did you get that? Don't you remember? What do you want? Where did you get that from? Do you know where I've lived during the last ten years? I don't care, my friend. - I want to leave. - Of course... Of course you wanna leave. How long will you keep faking? Until you manage to kill her for good. What are you talking about, you bastard? Give me that. Cheap brandy. - Give me my keys. - You know, I filmed you drinking. What will Doris think when she sees this video? What do you want? The truth. Because tomorrow, at nine in the morning, she'll get an email with a video of you. Getting hammered at the bar on Ipiranga Street. You got there at 6:30 and left at 7:49. Or am I lying? Why are you doing this? I hope she remembers her leg. Don't you recognize me? Don't you remember your own family? It can't be. It can't be. Do you know where I've lived during the last ten years? In a hospital. Alone. - Expecting a visit from someone who... - You should be rotting in jail, brat. - I'll call the police. - Dad? - Daughter? What are you doing here? What are you doing here? Doris, your dad has something to tell you. No, don't listen to him. - Don't listen to him, it's David. He's messing with you, get in the car. - David. - What, David, dad? He's Pedro. - Remember what you have to do. Get in that car. Carlos, I just want to save you now. Give me that key here. Give me that key. I'll kill you. Police, good night? Police, good night? Police, good night? Do you have any complaints? Hello, is there anyone on the line? Hello? Police, good night? I'm sorry. It'll end soon. Thanks. It's great to have you here. Look, one really can't miss Ms Maria's carrot cake. This one didn't even come out the way I wanted to. Thank you for calling me, David. Your company is always really good. - It's been a while, huh? - Yeah. David, Carlos told me he's already playing the piano again. - Nah... - Really? - Just a little bit. Are we going to have another artist in the family? Now that you know what the new address is, don't make me force you to come again. - Look, we'll be back, huh? - You should! - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Bye, David. - Bye. To look at the stars? You could've come up with a better excuse. I'm still taking you to meet my paradise, then you'll get me. That place is transformative. You don't go back the same from there. I wanna go. David, we totally forgot the photography assignment. You deceived me by saying that you were an applied student. Sorry, I've been kind of busy these days. Of course! I'm not an expert in photography, but I know a place that has a great light. Come in. This place has been on sale for years. Hold on, this means that anyone can come in and find us here? We'll have to risk it. Don't you like some danger? Follow me. Go. Stand in that light. Sit down. - Sit down and I'll stay here. - Isn't this light perfect? The light is good, but the model... Here. Look at me. Is it good? So, I guess I better be going. It's getting late. No, chill out. Look at the size of this bed. As long as you don't harass me, it's okay. Me? Nah... There must be ghosts here. So the ghosts here must be voyeurs. Ana's screams are loud, huh? That doesn't sound like a moan. What Ana? Ana... Ana? Didn't I tell you? It's her that I've been fucking. Since Wednesday, actually... I bring her here. Yeah, she didn't tell me anything. - I think I'm going, it's getting late. - No, no. You're forbidden I have a surprise. Wear this. You even keep your clothes here. Yes, I do. Where are you going? - To the bathroom. - Are you ashamed to do it in front of me? - Take off your clothes, boy. - I'm not used to do it. It's better this way. It's really hot in here. You have to take off your pants too. Go. Now I can't see you. Done. I'll put a song for us. What's this? You don't know? Look. Go. One, two, three... - Good? - Good. Want another? I know she likes it. Free your mind, David. Turn yourself in. Do what you wanna do. David. Follow me Let me show you something. Press play. Wow, Marcos. I didn't know that, besides being a hooker, you were a serial killer. What kind of a name, PHAEDO. Where did you get this, Caio? Me? Someone got this from the deep web and now everyone's talking about it. Come on, guys. This must be fake. I bet that this guy's already preparing a new video. I've already subscribed to his channel. He's not an amateur. No. He's not an amateur. I GOT YOU!!! CRIME SHOCKS RELIGIOUS COMMUNITY I made the coffee at the cloth strainer, just like my mother used to. Feeling anything different? - Anything. - Ouch, what a mood! It doesn't look like someone who's turning twenty-one. Twenty-one? It looks like I didn't even see the time passing by. - Hey, can you hear me? I don't know if I did anything wrong, but... Why did you leave? Why don't you talk to me anymore? Say something, please. If you want to. Oh, David, chill out. I said I had to leave. You were the one who wanted to sleep there, remember? Everything okay in there? Yep. Everything's fine. Forget it. Okay, do you know a coffee shop near the church? - Meet me there by the end of the afternoon. - At six? - Yeah, it can be at six. I got a gift for you. Don't worry, I'll be there. Great. Take care, boy. - Bye. - Bye. The serial killer known as PHAEDO uploaded another video and, in it, the brutality of two more murders. The forensics confirmed that Doris Abreu, 20, and her father, Carlos Abreu, 45 were brutally murdered and charred. - No, no, I'll have... Two cups of tea, please. - Police still don't have any suspects. - Thanks. Investigations continue in search of what experts call digital clues, which are traces left behind when someone posts a video on the internet. But this killer really made the forensics's work difficult, as such digital clues have not yet been found. - Wow. People really get to watch this kind of news all day. - Hey. - Well, I'll order something. Your tea. Thanks. My grandmother always says it's good to serve tea for your guests. Makes a good impression. Your grandma got it right. When will I get to meet her? Sometime. I was going to tell you this in a different way, but I'm a little anxious. I got a gift for you. And my gift will have lots of grass, a little house and several stars in the sky. So, what's going on? The police think it's somebody from the college. What? - The killer, goddamn. - They're inquiring everyone. I have a testimony scheduled for tomorrow. Excuse me. Ana. Hey, hey. Calm down. Look, come here. Calm down. They're going to get this guy, everything will be fine. The police talked to you? No... Why would they? You were at the bookstore, I saw you with the girl who died. And... Did you tell that to them? Would you, David? - Would you... - No. How long have you known me? Look at me. You're my best friend. Look... Come here. I was doing the aesthetic assignment that day. I never went to that bookstore. Right? Yeah, I don't remember it well... Everything will be okay now. Boo. What's up, David? Thomaz... New camera, huh? May I? Forgot to tell you. I just left an inquiry with the police. They've asked several questions. About you. Actually, I... I even owe you an apology for that. I didn't have a choice, David. I had to tell everything I know. But, look... I think that now it's only a matter of time... - And what do you mean by that? - That you can't fool me, David. I know really well who you are. And I'll screw you. Fag. David, where are you going? I'll travel, with Jonatas. I do not think that this travel with this guy is a good idea, not now. Yeah, but I'm going. - I can't stay here any longer - You're not going. What are you doing? Taking care of you. And who do you think you are, to talk to me like that? I just want to protect you. Protect me? Protect me from what? I don't think I need protection. David, this lad's no good. You know what you must do to him. I don't want to hear you anymore. If you like him so much, why don't you try to bring him to our family? It might work. - Clear out. - If you go there, you won't get back. - Out of here! Out of here! Go away. I'm going to... Get you a coat. It's freezing outside. I knew you'd love it. I made us something. I made the coffee at the cloth strainer. Feeling anything different? I'm not, actually. You could be a little polite, huh? It's good. I'm in the mood to play a game with you. A game? I think it's time for us to know each other a little more. It's simple: both of us will write a question in a paper, then we trade our papers and answer the written question. Sometimes... Writing, things become more honest. And this will be our bond of trust. No judging. Okay. Well, Since I've made up this game, I should kick it off. Why do you want to be a filmmaker? There are some things in life that simply bloom. it's like they're always kept inside, just waiting for the time to leave. It's inevitable. That's my relationship with the camera. Film is... my favorite art. I like movies too. But movies like Titanic... Hold on. You don't look like you're a romantic one. What do you mean? And shut up, the game requires you to write down, with no judging. And have you ever been in love? Has any Rose ever appeared in your life? I fall in love every day. So what would you do if you were in love with a good friend? But you're afraid to open up to him. Afraid of losing his friendship. I think you should tell this friend how you feel. No fear. But, before, pour this friend another cup of coffee because he's thirsty. Have you ever hurt someone? At least this time I have a pencil sharpener here. Look, you have a red Moleskine. Can I see it? - No, it's no big deal. - Oh, come on! Who are them? I don't know. It's easy to find out, just develop the negative. - There's no need. - C'mon, give me this photo. - At least my college time came in handy. - I'm leaving for a moment. - I need to get some air. - Okay. I'll put your notebook back in your bag. Don't listen to him, it's David. He's messing with you, get in the car. What's this? Jonatas. I have to go. Sorry, I'll explain to you another time. I shouldn't have come. We're not done talking. Open this door. You're the guy who... I don't recognize you anymore. I've already told you to get out of my way. And to open this door. You lied to me. No. Calm down. Let's talk. I'll... I'll explain everything to you. Explain, David? I know what you are. I can see it. Excuse me. What are you doing? You cannot do that. We're leaving here together. We're going to be together. - And solve all this. - He's a liar. You're a liar. No. There's only the two of us here now. Let's solve this. Solve it the best way. No one else needs to get hurt. Not me, not you. You have to trust me. Calm down. Dude, give me this knife. Trust me. It'll be fine. It'll never leave this room. What are we going to do now? You can't murder me. What would you do in my place? You killed a girl. She had a lifetime ahead of her, a life full of dreams. Who are you to destroy those dreams? I gave her a new life. I want you to be locked up somewhere, without a chance of escaping. You're a cancer. You destroy. You're evil. I talk to them. They're fine. Just like the pigeon. I saw her flying. - She's okay. - The pigeon is dead! The dead don't return. I'll end this once and for all. I can't set you free. What will you do? What will you do? You put something in my drink. Here. Good to see you, Carlos. Jonatas. You can't kill me. Come here, David. You'll get dizzy, boy. Enough, enough. Take him. - Again? - It's enough playing for today, let's eat. - Is this cake good, Ms Maria? - It's marvelous! Look, the cake! It smells great. Bringing some snacks... - Put it there. - You want the cheese one? - I'll have another. Take the chicken one too. - Say hi. - Hi. - You too, again. - Hi. - Okay, I'll set up the camera. - All set... - Look! What did you draw this time, huh? Did you know that Little David is a great artist? Well, well. Are we going to have another artist in the family? Sit down, darling. Auntie, can I have some cake now? Can you... Only after everyone has dined. Those are the rules here. - What's this, Sofia? - Nothing. Let me see. Pass the mashed potatoes. I know you like it. SQUARE OF GOD Today is a special day. Today's the Salvation Day. Come near, please. Kneel with me. Close your eyes. Talk to God... He's right by your side. He's listening to you. - Amen? - Amen. And the Father said: "And I will do whatever you ask in my name". Ask now. Ask the Lord for your greatest desire. He knows you, he knows your heart. He knows your greatest desire. God is using you now. David, I know what you are. I've already told you. You can't kill me. Why are you here? I'm here because you want me to be here. I didn't want any of this. - Any of this. - You still don't understand? I can't leave. But I'm different now. I'm a better person. I want to end this. You know how. Now there's only one person left for us to be complete. The most special of them all. You have fulfilled the wish of us all, David. Now only yours is missing. A family... The missing piece. You're not alone. We'll see each other soon. It's funny that it ends like this. But, after all... I'm feeling good. Actually... I've never felt better. So that's your story. Yes, ma'am. Before you go, I'll tell you a theory that's buzzing in my head. I'm listening. It's all too easy. All the evidence is there. But, perhaps, the fact that camera used to tape the crimes was bought by Thomaz... - might have been manipulated. - New camera, huh? Perhaps the genetic material found on the crime scene was planted there. Just like the evidences found in the accused's locker. Perhaps, David, you can be much worse than I thought.
