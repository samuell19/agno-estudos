Halt! Shit! Lartigue? Don't move. Wait for orders. Lartigue, do you copy? To the happy couple! And to the grandmother! What the hell are you doing? Have you lost it? Where are you? Answer! What, you've never seen an ultralight land? Peasants… The Tiger! The Panther. The Snake. What's your opinion, Major? What? Oh, I'm… And you're wrong. People read books, but they buy book covers. So? The… The Leopard. The Leopard Goes for the Throat. Plus, leopard-print, that's what parachutists wore. I was never a parachutist. Not you, but him. And he's what matters. But I mean, he is me. So… I demand an explanation! Thanks, everyone. An explanation about what? Nick Denver? Stay, Major. My dear Pauline, poor Nick had a very troubled life. He had a hundred brushes with death, and he dies of old age. Isn't that lucky? Old age? Nick Denver, dying of old age? Indeed. I gathered some statistics. Have a seat. Your hero has seen 114 people dead. He solved 87 mysteries and sent 87 murderers to prison. He has been shot at 311 times. And he kissed 122 women. His heart gave out. It's medically explainable. Yes, because it's… Plus, Pauline, out of the 122 women your detective kissed, he didn't sleep with a single one. Oh, I see. You want pornography. You want savages who slit people's throats with daggers and roll around in damp sheets with lewd creatures who they make scream with vulgar pleasure. Well, you can count me out! This gentleman will do just fine. Excuse me, um… Am I the one making these lewd creatures scream? It's a funny story. As a student, she fell in love with a young man, and then he disappeared. Over time, she recreated an idealized version of him. She made him into Nick Denver. We published her first book after May '68. It was a hit. Of course. Except that Nick Denver got old. -What are you thinking about? -About the Leopard getting old. But he was just born. He has ten good years ahead of him. For a secret agent, that's an eternity. Hello. But my taxi! What do I do? Yes, him. I saw him quickly. -What did he want? -Same as everyone: to be published. He told me a story about a satellite sent off course. -Sir! -It wasn't very clear. Nor very original. I've got 30 stories just like it. Did he leave a manuscript? No, I told him to send one over, as usual. -Sir? -Here. What are you doing here, Major? And yourself? -I… -Did they fire you, too? We'll be publishing the major's first book in two weeks. The Leopard Goes for the Throat. Come, Pauline. And you're here for… It's too late for the books. I just signed my contract, and since we have all the same stories… So, Colonel, are you on a case? -Quite the case indeed. -Really? Just the kind of thing I could have given you. That is, if you hadn't stepped down. Oh, boy! If I put that in a novel, no one would believe it. Oh, well… Who's going to replace me? Barneville. Barneville… Is that a joke? You and I both know he can't see a thing. Without his glasses, he can't tell an Eskimo from a Dutchman. Don't you remember, in Caracas, at the French embassy, when he asked the bishop to dance? -I know… -Then you're not serious. I know, but for this kind of thing, the ideal would be… What is it? The Leopard. You know what I mean, Lartigue. He'd wrap it up in 240 pages. Might I remind you that before falling, he said hello to me. -Did you know him? -No, otherwise… And that's all he said? With what he had in his back, we couldn't chat much. What do you think, Major? Oh, well, I haven't been filled in… -What was in his back? -A knife, sir. A knife? Ah. Well, I'm sorry, Colonel, but you're right, ma'am. -Miss. -Excuse me. With a knife in his back, "hello" isn't the first word that comes to mind. No matter how polite one is. Thank you, miss. I'll need to call you in again. I'm asking all of you for the utmost discretion. -Lartigue. -Oh… Don't worry. I've solved more cases like this than anyone. And believe me, Nick Denver only spoke to reporters to tell them the culprit's name. Who is she talking about? A very dear friend who is… Who is… A whole hour lost, and nobody's going to reimburse me for it. All that for a trip that's not even worth fifty bucks. Rose! I need to tell you. -Rose! -Yes? It smells like Monte Cristo Number Three. You had a man over? It's none of my business. In order to get a man, don't give in to any of them. -Not even the one you want? -Especially not that one. Sit down. A man just died in my arms. -He killed himself for you? -No. Listen. "My name is Thoraval. I am doomed. Sooner or later, they'll find me." That was a week and a half ago. Third attempt, third failure. Thoraval, the man who was murdered, was working on the project. -At what level? -The highest! He was a first-rate physicist. He went missing six months ago. And along with him, the magnetic tapes containing all the flight parameters for the carrier rocket. Do you think this Thoraval was a… No. He was just a pawn, they used him, then disposed of him. They… Who? The organization. Gallois was able to infiltrate them, but… We found him with his hands tied and a bullet in his head. Yes, I know. But what organization? What does it organize? And for whose benefit? That's what matters. Certain countries, shall we say… "neutral," still want to know what their neighbors are up to. So they need spy satellites. But spy satellites that can spot a can of food in the desert, and tell you the brand, too, those aren't on the market. That's where the organization comes in. So, this is everything Gallois got for us. I mean, I only told you that… Yeah, just chatting. -But do what you want. -Right. I mean, I can't cover you anymore. So if you heard that I went for a stroll over there, you wouldn't be too surprised. No. Hands up! You're not calling the police? No. Mr. Latimer wants them alive. Go pack my bags. Pardon me. Pardon me. Excuse me. Pardon me. Look Verdier, I'm not asking for much. Right, almost nothing. A plan. Yeah, well, a small one! Oh? Not a Boeing? Come on. I can't. You're nuts, Lartigue. Who are you doing this for? Oh, my God! For myself. Sorry. Okay. I want to prove that I'm not too old for this. Out of pride. A little. Hm… If I do this, Paris will know. And I'll be done for. Paris is my problem. Yeah… I've done you a few favors, haven't I? I'll do you one in return. I never saw you. Nice one. No worries. Have fun. Oh, right! I almost forgot. How silly of me. Two beers! Two beers. There? Ma'am. Miss. The 9:30 train is coming the other way! It's going to be a disaster! How can we stop it? Couldn't you watch where you're going?! I'm sorry! Oh, it's you! Oh, no… I didn't see you. It was an accident. Is that for you? I'm afraid so! -Can I ask you-- -Wait! Get down! Otherwise, you won't hear my answer. Come on. Let's talk someplace else. Get down! I say… Nice friends you've got. So… Do you see what I see? Look. Listen. -You're going to cover me. -What? Don't be scared. You'll cover me. You'll shoot. -Okay? -I've never killed anyone. I doubt you'll start today. But that's okay. Shoot wherever. Scare them, make them laugh. Do whatever you want. I'll try to steal the truck. Ready? Not in the air! Like this. One, two, three! You can shoot at them! No! -There's no point. -Sure! It makes them laugh. That distracts them. Take the wheel, then. Hang on! Come on! Give me my gun! Are you like this naturally? Here. I don't want to smoke! Take it. Faster! Scoot over. -Here's your lighter back. -Thanks. Good riddance. So, you wanted to ask me something? Yes. Why are you here? Huh? I know, you're going to say, "top secret mission," "state secrets," but for me, it's not Lartigue on the case, it's the Leopard. With, as a bonus, a story full of bloodshed and femmes fatales that'll make poor Latimer drool. We'll see about the bloodshed, and as for the femmes fatales… What? Anyway. A new chapter starts: the lascivious old adventurer turns to the young woman and whispers, "What are you doing here?" -I'm a tourist. -Great idea. It's a charming place. Very welcoming… The travel agencies don't know how to satisfy their clients. Do you think you have a good subject for the Leopard? You really got me figured… You're too good. Yes, but the problem is that Nick Denver's already on the case. Oh, dear God… Then it's every man for himself. Exactly. Well, I'll show you… Every man for himself. You want excitement? You're gonna get it! You should do the same. It's calming after all that intensity. Nick Denver never peed after getting shot at? Well… Ow! Here. Go cut some wood. Cut some wood? What do you want to fill it with? Go on! How's it coming? Not good! We have coffee, don't we? So it's not just brawn that counts. Brains matter, too. The brains should hurry up, 'cause the brawn is tired of waiting. -Go on. -Don't touch me! Go on! Seriously! How long are you going to sulk? Until you realize what a shitstorm you got us into. -You don't have to be crude! -Sorry. "What a fix," then? No, a shitstorm! That's where we are. And? You're trying to scare yourself. A little adventure is good! Exciting for a little bourgeois woman who's spent her whole life glued in front of her typewriter. But we're not writing a novel here. We're in the story! Like idiots! Out in the brush, there are real bodies that stink. In your little airport novels, the dead bodies smell good. The detectives have tweed jackets with little pockets and magnifying glasses. Are you done? For now. I have two things to say. First, Nick Denver never wore tweed jackets with tiny pockets! Because he has good taste! Second, it's not your job to protect me. So let me out here. Instead of worrying about where my butt is, you can worry about your own! Somebody's getting upset! Are you letting me out? Oh! Gladly. Hm. No point waiting for me. I'll be just fine on my own. I'm not waiting for you. But… Careful, Major. There's a hole. Want some? What is it? Moaboa. And in French? Snake. Hmm. What a flavor. I'm glad you cooked, because… that recipe isn't in my sister's cookbook. Dessert? I'm fine, thanks. Nothing's stopping you from cleaning up. GOOD… MORNING WITH WAKE-UP COFFEE Good morning. Hey! Good morning. What time is it? Come see. Doesn't that remind you of anything? I knew it! Thoraval's last words. What's the connection between coffee and rockets? How do you know he was working with rockets? From Thoraval's manuscript. I found it in the taxi. And you read it? Yes, and that name, Sinkoula, was in it. And what else did it mention? I only read 50 pages. I took a few notes, and someone took it from me. "Someone." Who? A man who was set on getting it back. Thanks. You couldn't have mentioned that sooner? It was every man for himself. Hold this for me. -You have a map? -Yes. It was every man for himself before. Pauline! Pauline! Shit! Major! -Major! -Yes, miss, I'm coming! Tell me who you work for! Major, help! Who do you work for? Major! I can't hold on! I'm coming! -Help! -You're gonna talk! Help! -Talk! -OK! Major! -Major! -Yes! I'm coming. Help! You should have said something! Come on! Do you know how to ride a horse? I learned when I was little. Great. It'll come in handy. Are you sure this can't fly? Have you ever seen an ostrich fly? I don't want to cross Africa on this! Major! Wait, Mr. Leopard! You asked me if I could ride a horse, not an ostrich! Sure. You didn't have your riding hat, or your boots. Wait up. Shit, shit, shit! If riding is my family's style, chivalry certainly isn't yours! Over. You don't scare me. I've been dragging you around like an old bag since I've been here. I put up with you even though you're useless. I look out for you, I even cooked! I saved your life, and you say I'm not chivalrous. But Jesus Christ, I'm on a mission here! So listen up. Either you shut your mouth, or you hitchhike home. Bon voyage. Major! Shit, shit, shit, shit… -You forgot one. -Shit! There you go. Come on. Come on. One more push. The truck is a mile farther. Shit! What's this? Take the wheel and drive straight backwards. Go! What's she doing now? Pauline! Quick! Get on. No! Get on! Are you hurt? It burns. But I think the bullet went through. LANDMINES -Did you see the sign? -Exactly! They blocked the road so we'd have to go to the right! But we actually have to go straight! I've written this kind of scene ten times! The car only breaks down once the hero is near their goal. Did you really base Nick Denver off a man you knew in real life? It's a dreadfully trite story, Major. A young, crazy adventurer, intelligent, very handsome. And a young, upper-class student girl with an authoritarian father who refused the marriage. Instead of drinking, you could help me. That's true. We secret agents, we bounce around from femmes fatales to dreamy dames… We, in white smoking jackets, and they in black furs, raking in fortunes on green carpets. Ah… We live in technicolor. What do I do now? Right or left? You're the brains, darling. Personally, I'd go left, but my God… Do you hear that? It sounds like a piano. A piano? Why not! We could have a whole group. Wait here! Place your bets. We can still bet. Place your bets. No more bets. No more bets. No more bets. Oh, that's… That's kind of you, sir. Of course. What happened? A car accident. My driver went off the road. He went to get help. Maybe you ran into him. No. Is it serious? -Oh, no. -Careful. It's nothing. It's just my leg. It's nice of you to help me. I'm not going far. I'm going to Sinkoula. It's… It's five minutes from here. Are you in the coffee business? Yes. -Trader? -No, I'm a planter. Ah! -Me too. -Well! Surprising, huh? You're not from around here? No, I'm… I'm passing through. Do you have problems with the punka in your area? Punka… Oh, well, yes! Constantly. Always the same… We can go whenever you'd like. Is your driver a brunette? Tall, distinguished? Who talks a lot? Oh, yes, she sure can talk! No, no, I'm going to Sinkoula! -I'm going that way. -I'm going that way! Is that you, Victoria? No. I need help, ma'am. -Help? -Yes. There's a wounded man out in the brush. A man? Yes. See? -Put him here. -So comfortable! Watch the leg! Excuse me, you can leave him now. Thank you. -Oh, no! -Excuse me! You, too, please. But that was nice! Thank you. Farewell, my lovelies. Nice. -They found you in the jungle? -I hitchhiked. I got picked up by a bad-tempered driver who hit me in the head. I was knocked out. And I woke up in the arms of these divine creatures. It was… Ow! Christ… Show me your wound. No, don't touch. Listen! Don't act like a child. You're not a doctor! You should know that in every woman, there's a nurse sleeping. Then let her sleep. Easy. Eau de Cologne, now. Oh, Mommy! Does it hurt? It stings! Let me help you get this off. -Pretty lady! -Yes… Let me explain. Don't explain a thing. Art cannot be explained. Ow! -Does it hurt? -Yes, please. Nick? Nick Denver? Hello, Nick Denver. The young man with no future and no fortune, who was chased away like an oaf by the parents of the pretty girl, one day found his loved one again deep in the heart of mysterious Africa. How's your father, Pauline? Dead. Then there's nothing standing in the way of our love. Ah, Pauline! This calls for celebration. Let us drink to our love. Time has passed, but like in the stories, we haven't changed. Ah… Your colors. This tub is now sailing under your protection. Which means? Which means you alone will decide its fate. And that of its passengers. For years, I have obeyed your writings to the letter, acting only according to your will. I'm not complaining. You've spoiled me. The portrait is better than the original. But since you got to Africa, I've been leading you where I please. According to my whims and desires. Now, Miss Romance Writer… We're even. Oh, Pauline! I offer you freedom and fortune. Power, and love… Mm! I'm offering you an empire! You're still as crazy as ever. A kingdom would be enough. -You don't believe me? -No. Even the birds obey you? Are you sure they're birds? Ah, Pauline… I could do anything for you. Anything. What's he up to? And the major? What will we do about him? What an author always does when a character gets in the way. Eliminate him. Oh… I'm in pain! Oh! I'm sorry. I'm so clumsy! You should get changed. Thanks, I couldn't have thought of that! Well played. Right? A little crude, and not chivalrous, but effective. You make do with what you've got. I suppose you're sorry for knocking me out last night. And to make up for it, you'll take us to Sinkoula. Something like that. You know more than I do about this case. I've been looking into it since long before you. Then why this little game? What do you want from me? For now, you're my prisoner. I'll be asking the questions. And I have no questions for you. You're looking for a secret organization. We're sailing toward them. Relax. You're going to need your strength. Once we're there, it's every man for himself. In what domain? Every domain. One day, I'll find out who you are. Why? You haven't figured it out? No. Not yet. Come quick! Quick! No! What are you doing? What do you mean? He wants to kidnap you. So I'm stopping him. Out of the goodness of my heart. That's no reason to hurt him! I'm in a bad mood! Someone hits me, I hit back! I still owe you one! If you'd rather go with him… -Maybe I do. -Oh! In that case, I can drop you off. -No, thanks. -Are you sure? Whatever you want. Did he tell you who he works for? No. No point whispering to you, then. What'd he tell you? If he tried to sweep you off your feet, I don't care. It's normal. Guys lost in the jungle, as soon as they see a skirt, it's like moths to a flame. -But not you? -We're talking about him! I know you know who he is! You don't understand anything! You're blind and stubborn! What? What'd I say? That man is Nicolas Villambert. Great. So? To me, he's Nick Denver. You mean… I didn't see that one coming! Look! Vodka, caviar. You don't see that every day out here! Come on, Pauline! Don't sulk! Come here. This too shall pass. Have a drink. That burns. Caviar! What's that? It's… music. We can't stay here. You're right. Let's go back to the hotel and take a bath. Now is not the time for jokes. Jump in! Quick! Quick! There's that goddamn plantation. Wake-Up Coffee. Should we try to blend in? Yes. Do like me. We'll do the Arab trick. Come on. Wait for me. Look, our truck. Oh. Africa is immense, and yet we keep running into each other. It must be fate. Cut the crap and start explaining. The organization thought Pauline was a secret agent. Dear Pauline, confusing her for a spy! For those of us who know her, it's unthinkable. So you figured out that it was me. Bravo! You're really something. But that's not what I want to know. Oh? And what's that? What does this all mean? -These little drawings. -Ah, you've got an eye. One of our launch bases currently under construction. And the rockets and all that? The rockets. We can't buy them, so we steal them. Little by little, pieces go missing. A piece of an engine, a tail, a gyroscope… And all those pieces end up here in bags of coffee. A perfect cover. See this? You know it? Yes. I suppose you steal the fuel, too? Look. Nitromethane. An explosive fuel. And we have an inexhaustible supply right beneath our feet. But it's dangerous. The slightest shock up here would blow this place sky high. Ah, the title of your next novel, Pauline. We'll write it together. Nick Denver and the Lake of Fire. Like it? What about you, Major? I don't give a damn about titles. What I care about is the ending. Don't be so impatient. Right. Let's put the final touch on. Come, Pauline. This time, you won't abandon me. Bye bye, Major. Don't be scared. The organization will take care of you. This one's gonna be right in the kisser! Oh, no, Pauline! Sorry, Nick, but I've gotten used to deciding what happens to my characters on my own. Bravo, Pauline! Wait! Watch your head. Yes. Come on. The lake of fire. Watch your feet. This place could blow. There's the hole. That's our way out. I'll try to find a path. Okay… When it's time to go… Let's go. Be careful, Major. Hang on! I… I'm slipping. Yes. Grab the scarf. There. Come on. Come on! There. -Thank you, Major. -Okay! There! Come on. Keep your head down! Faster! Take the wheel! -Not me! -Who else? Straight ahead! Stop by the gap. Come on, step on it! What do we do now? We wait. It won't be long. I wanted to play with Nick Denver's little toy models. The end of an adventure is always sad, isn't it? Sounds like you're starting to like them. What if I put my novel on hold and helped you write The Leopard? Would you take me on your next mission? So you're giving up on Nick Denver? Let's forget him for now. Okay. No more fooling around. Promise? -I swear. -Scout's honor! Can't you ever do anything like everyone else for once? I'd like to learn! Subtitle translation by: Adam Lozier
