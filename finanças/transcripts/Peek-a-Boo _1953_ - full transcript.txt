Now all these interesting freaks from every land and clan, and all we charge you here today is the small sum of a dime. And all we charge you here today is the small sum of a dime. Ah, one moment, please, I must announce, our feature card today. That hula-hula maiden from the island, Hawaii! (traditional hula music) That, ladies and gentlemen, is only a sample of what we have on the inside. On the inside, we have Little Egypt. Little Egypt, she does an ancient oriental dance, the dance of Salome, the dance of the Seven Veils, the same dance that cost John the Baptist his head. How she wiggles, how she quivers, just like your mother used to make jelly on a frosty morning. Why, this show is like an old pair of socks. The longer you wear 'em, the stronger it gets. An old man 89 years old walking on crutches, smoking a corn cob pipe, he went in there to see that little lady dance. After seeing her dance, he came out, threw his crutches away, holding his corn cob in his hand, ran down the street hollering fire. I'll tell you, neighbors, it's hotter than Hades. The band plays, the performers retire. The show starts right away! Everybody! (fanfare music) Hurry, get your tickets! (indistinct shouting) It's never out and never over. - Hello, hello! - Well, neighbor, what did you think of our little show? - I didn't like it. - What's the trouble with it? - No monkeys! - No monkeys. How would you like to go with the show? - I'm no monkey. - That's right. Everyone knows you're no monkey. - A monkey has a tail! - Yeah, that's my trouble. And you don't want any tail. All right, neighbor, but how would you like to go with the show and go to work with the show? - Go to work with the show? - That's right! - I would like that! - All you have to do is stick your head in a little hole. That's it? There's the hole right over there. - Oh, yeah. - You see, you put your head in that hole, the town boys come along and throw baseballs at your head. - At my head? - That's right. (unintelligible), hit my brother! He don't care what happens to him. Now, now, wait a minute. I assure you that there's no danger. - See that? - What's that? That's what we call a little protector. - Protector? - Now, you place the cap on your head. Now then shoot the ball, hit the cap. The ball bounces off of the cap. I repeat, the ball bounces off of the cap. Yeah, but what makes the ball bounce off of the cap? I repeat, what makes the ball bounce off of the cap? My head! See you later. Now, now, now, wait a minute, neighbor. I'm gonna show you something that absolutely even you didn't realize. - Oh, yeah? - You see this here? - Yes, sir. - This is what they throw at you! - It didn't even bounce. - What do you care? If it hits you, then you can quit. Well, if it hits me, I won't have to quit. Look, I was only kidding you. This is what they'll throw at you. - Oh, a rubber ball! - Of course! - Wouldn't hurt you with that. - No! Now put the cap on and get your head in the hole. - Okay. - I'll see if we can't get some customers right away. - Send them in! - All right. Alrighty, folks, step right up. Knock his brains out for 10 cents. Anyone at all! What's the trouble now, neighbor? Don't tell them, "Knock my brains out" - for 10 cents!” - Why not? - They might do it! - You haven't any brains. - That's why I'm here! - All right, now, get your head in the hole. See if we can't get some customers here. Alrighty, folks, step right up, try your luck here. (laughing) Look at the little monkey! (laughing) - I'm no monkey! - All right, she knows you're no monkey, everyone does. Would you like to try your luck? Three balls for a dime. There you are, thank you very kindly, lady. Pitch 'em high, pitch 'em low. In the heights, and then away they go. First one, she missed the little man. Second one, she missed the little man. Third one, she missed the little man. Well, I guess I'm not throwing very well today. - No. - But I'll be back tomorrow - to try my luck on you! - Uh-huh. - Well. - Hey, hey, hey, just a minute, - where are you going? - I'm gonna try my luck on her! You'll do nothing of the kind. Get back in that hole there. Hurry up, get in there! Who do you think you are anyways? Alrighty, folks, step right up. - Well, Bob Levin! - Why, Leon... ooh! - What's the trouble, Bob? - Leon, I've got a sore arm. Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, Bob. Sorry, sorry. - Bad shape. - Yeah. Hey, what happened to that little colored boy - that was here yesterday? - Colored boy? Yeah. He died, this morning. Well, it's not my fault. I only threw one ball. Yes, the ball just seemed to stick in his skull. - Psst, come here. - Pardon me, Bob. Something troubling you? What happened to that colored boy? Shh, that's the fella that killed the colored boy yesterday. (laughing) - What am I laughing at? - Ah, but don't worry. - He's got a sore arm. - Oh, yeah? - Can't get it up. - That's my trouble. Oh, you can get your head up in that hole. - Now get in there. - Okay. Bob, the boy's a little bit dubious about your arm. Would you mind tossing one over just to show him how sore the arm is? - Not at all! - Okay. - I'd be very glad to. - Okay. Oh. Oh, poor Bob. I'm sorry for you, Bob. - Bob! - Yeah. - Big 20-game winner. - That's right. Let him throw all the balls. - No. - Let him throw the iron ball. - Yeah? - Sure. Okay, Bob, here you are. Throw one over the pan, boy! Thatta boy. - Hey, wait! - What's the trouble now? What's this winding up business here? He's just limbering up his arm. Don't limber up my head here! Don't worry, rubber balls. - Oh, rubber balls! - That's the idea, sure! All right, Bob, sock it in, get a baby doll. - That's all, that's all! - What"♪ the trouble? That's it, I quit!

Hey, boy, come on down here, will you, quickly? - Yes, sir! - Run out and get us a bottle of beer, will you? - Right away. - Bottle of beer! Hey, wait a minute! You forgot to give me some money. - Money! - Money! Why I'm surprised at you. Anyone can get beer with money! The idea is to get beer without money! Well, then you're doing something! Oh, I never thought of that! Try to get a bottle of beer around here without any money, he'll get his neck broke, that's all that's going to happen to him. (laughing) Son of a gun, if he didn't get beer. Well, here... hey, wait a minute. That bottle is empty. There isn't any beer in that! Well, anybody can drink beer out of a full bottle! Drink beer out of an empty bottle - and you're doing something! - Ah. (dramatic music) Presenting Sherry Winters, The Yum Yum Girl. (mellow music) (applause) All right, folks, step right up.

Doc, I haven't felt like this ever since I've been a baby. Hey, look, you know something? I've got a good proposition for you, boy. - You have? - You know, I'm manufacturing these machines, I need people to take them out and place them on the market. How about you taking this machine, taking it out. Whatever monies you get, we'll split 50/50. All right! I'd be tickled to do that. That's a good idea. Now, then, of course, you'll have to be a doctor. - Oh, I'm a doctor. - I would have to have - a name for you. - Gotta give me a name. Let's see, what are we gonna call you? - No, we can't call you that. - Everybody calls me that. I have it, we'll call you Dr. Stoopnagle! - Stoopnagle, very good name. - Very good name. Now then, remember, whatever monies you get, we'll charge them, and you split with me 50/50. I give you 50/50, don't worry. Here comes a patient right now, boy. There is a patient there. Oh, Doctor!

Give it to her through the box. - I'll never make it. - Oh, yes, you will, certainly. Look, the electrodes go right into her hand. Put them in her hand and give her a treatment. That's the idea, just hold on to that. That's the idea. How do you feel, baby? Oh, Doctor! I feel so good! Oh, Doctor, I feel so good! Oh, Doctor! I feel so good! - I cured her, Doc, I cured her! - Now, come on, give me half. - Half of what? - Half of the money. I didn't get no money! Look, son, you've got to keep your mind on the race, otherwise, you and I are gonna split partnership right now. - Okay, okay! - All right! Another patient, someone is sick, yes, sir. Where's the doctor? Oh, my, where's the doctor? - Oh, the doctor! - Don't get excited! - Here's the doctor! - That's the doctor right there. Now, what is wrong with you, young lady?

Another customer, boy, you've got to... Where's the doctor? Oh, oh! There he is right over here. - This is the doctor, madam. - Over here. What's the matter with you, baby? Oh, I've got a terrible toothache! Oh, brother, I didn't know the roots ran down that far. Well, bud, it looks as though you're gonna have to go over there and fill a cavity. Wait a minute. I am a doctor, not a dentist. Well, go over there and jerk it out. - The tooth, the tooth! - Oh, sure! That's right. Now, grab a hold of that. Oh, I've never had anything like this in my hands before! I wonder where she's from now, huh? Well, you'd better give her a treatment and cure her toothache, boy. Here, just grab them, they're not gonna hurt you at all. Now, how do you like that? Oh, Doctor! I feel so good! Oh, Doctor, I feel so good! Oh, Doctor, I feel so good! Ah? Well, she feels good.
