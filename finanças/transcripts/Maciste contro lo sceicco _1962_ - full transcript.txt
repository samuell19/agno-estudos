The domination of the Moors in Spain, came to a violent end at the end of the century. 15th century but 100 years later the country was still suffering from reciprocal reprisals and raids. During one of them, the Moors attacked the sanctuary of the Virgin of Malaga, killing many people, including the family of the Duke of Malaga. Seeking revenge, the duke and his soldiers landed on the coast of Africa attacking the city of Melida, led by Sheikh Mohammed el Kadar. After a desperate battle, they were overwhelmed by the sheikh's troops and as a last resort, they took down the holy obelisk in Melida, the symbol of Moorish power. One of the survivors still resists, being inspired by the magnificent example of the Duke of Malaga. Manual translation, adaptation and synchronization: Cristian82 - To death with them! - Not ! We have already been avenged. Dad, would you have spared them after this sacrilege? You were the one who provoked them, attacking their sanctuary against my will. At least give me the head of the Duke of Malaga. Look, that's his banner! Which of you is the Duke of Malaga? - He died ! "He was killed before sunrise!" CU: ED FURY MACISTE AGAINST THE SHEK Come with me ! Get up! Come on! Sheikh Mohammed Bari el Kadar is dead. Long live our new leader, Sheikh Abdul Kadar. In case you miss your company, I just captured some of your compatriots. Master, we'll soon have enough Spanish prisoners to be able to raise the holy obelisk of Melida with his hands. I oppose! That's not how a gentleman of my rank is treated. You can't put me in jail with my own sailors. Forget your rank, whoever you are, because I don't know you and I don't care. Now, eat or your head will end up like this. This ? The Duke of Malaga? But you are ... - Alive. - But buried. But who are you? Are you from Malaga? I left last month at the behest of my largest galleon. What happened there ? Tell me! Your lieutenant, Don Alfonso de Alvarez, took over the regency. He's the only one who still thinks you're alive and take care of the duchy until you return. MALAGA So many years of government, I have the right to be the Duke of Malaga. Please speak to the king again, Monsignor. Remind them of my loyalty. The king was quite explicit, as you well know. Until it is established that there are no survivors of the family members of the Duke of Malaga, it will not start with a new investiture. But everyone saw them die. Isn't that enough for His Majesty? The Marquis of Valencia is investigating this case. He's been investigating for years. What are you waiting for to find out? The king gave him a deadline until the end of the year. Then, without a doubt, you will receive your title. You need to keep in mind that you will not continue to drive just one of the richest provinces in the kingdom, but you will also inherit the vast properties of the late duke. And this is an issue that should not be ignored. But rest assured, the church is thinking of you. Luis! My loyal Frenchman! It's you, Don Ramiro! You're back ! Nice to see you, master! Excellency, your brother! Ramiro, what a surprise! I was afraid you wouldn't come back! I had a terrible adventure! I'll tell you later. Monsignor! Praise the Lord, my son, that you have returned alive and unharmed. How could you leave, Melida? Did you pay the sheikh a reward? I escaped from his prison! There was no problem. I'll leave you now. Surely you want to talk to yourself. With the blessing of the Lord. We can talk without being heard, can we? Yes. Why ? I bring you serious news Alfonso. The Duke of Malaga is alive! Are you sure ? He is a prisoner, ill-treated, exhausted, but still alive. In all these years he has managed to keep his identity a secret. The sheikh does not realize what prize he has in his possession. Well, then, that's it, Ramiro. Somehow, I felt like I didn't belong in this palace. Are you crazy? Listen, no one thinks the Duke of Malaga is alive. And certainly no one thinks his daughter survived. After you marry her, your position here will be permanent. I do not know what to say ! So far, we've been able to hide who her father is. But now I'm starting to wonder. Just as you were able to recognize the duke, so can someone else. And I don't know what we can do about it. Maybe you can stop them. I told. You have to marry Isabella. Miss Isabella! - Isabella! - I have to go. - She's looking for me. "It's like a century until tomorrow." "We won't be able to see each other tomorrow." - Why ? I can't explain. "Is it about the gardener?" - No, of course not. Then about whom? Tomorrow morning, the governor wants to see me! - The governor ?! Why ? - I do not know. But this morning his emissary came to talk to Mother Superior. - What was the reason ? - I do not know. - But I have to obey. " Miss Isabella!" Where you are ? I'll be at the palace tomorrow night. I'll have more courage if I see you there. See you tomorrow, Isabella! "You forgot your flowers, ma'am." - Thanks ! She is ! Let me go! Let me go! No, let me go! Let me go! If you thought it was wise to betray us, I would have killed you with this dagger. It's yours. It's a gift for you, sir. She is your reward. You paid well for the life you received from the sheikh. Tell the sheikh we'll see you in Melida. Let me come with you. I'll be useful to you there. No, you would be much more useful here. You have important things to do while I'm gone. Here you go ! Are you worried about something, Don Ramiro? Not at all! You see, Luis, I thought my brother was probably not very suitable for the province of Malaga. They need a man like you. Of course. It's outrageous. Incredibly outrageous. For more than 15 years, no Moor dared to appear in the port of Malaga. Mother Superior, are you sure? They could be pirates. No, no doubt they were Moors. May the Lord help us! And they didn't do anything to you but kidnap the girl? - No, that's all. - What reason did they have to kidnap her? Morandez, listen to me. I want you out to sea right away. But it is impossible. We are not ready. And besides, what are your chances? I'm already safe at home. I think they want a reward. Do you think he's going to ask for a lot of it? In my experience, nothing can be done to try to deal with the sheikh. I think we'd better forget about her. We can't expect to see her again. Excellency, I ask you again to let me go to Africa. I'm going alone. Given the situation, I think that's my right. It's something you don't know. Isabella, she's the only woman I've ever loved. And it's fair to risk my life for her. The proposal of this young officer must be taken seriously. If he'll be allowed to leave, we must ensure that this mission is as successful as possible. It will take at least a thousand people. Or maybe two. - You and who else? - Maciste! By order of His Excellency, the eminent, Don Alfonso Alvarez, the governor of Malaga we are here to witness the execution of Carlos Ortega, found guilty of rebellion and inciting others to revolt, against the laws of our country. He is sentenced to be hanged in the public square, as an example for his followers. Father ! Maciste... ! Maciste ! Let me through! Make room ! I was sent by the governor! Let me through! Make room ! Stop it! I have orders from the governor. This man must come with me. Glad to see you again, Antonio, but I'm afraid I can't come with you until I'm done here. But the governor has given you a very important mission in Africa. What matters is that I found a man who tried to give his life for his fellow men. If the governor really needs me, He'll have to pardon this man first. Don't worry, he won't be hanged until you talk to the governor. Maciste! Hurry up ! Do you remember telling me that after you released my father, are we going to get married I'm afraid we might not see each other again. Antonio's girlfriend is in trouble. How can I refuse him when he asks me to help him? Hey, Maciste! Are you sure you want to come back? I promise I'll do it. Sper. See you soon, baby! You are right. They may need your help, if they want to free Isabella. Yes, with the girl finally safe, what a shame it would be to have an "accident," on the way back from the trip. I'm telling you, my heart is almost broken, when I think I'm going to lose this beautiful ship. "Beautiful" ? You're crazy. With the money I just gave you, you'll be able to buy a real ship, not just another boat like the one you have now. Remember, it must look like an accident. Stay calm. And now, you better go look for those two. - Before he finds another boat, okay? - Good. It's been three months since I've sailed to the coast of Africa. And since the Moorish pirates were seen in these seas, I don't risk it. Well, maybe a bag of gold will make you change your mind. And what to do with gold if I lose my head. Then we can't persuade you to take us. I accept your offer. He would get along with the devil for a bag of gold. - When are you ready to leave? "We'll be at sea tomorrow morning." Perfect. - Yes, Luis? - It's done ! I'm already on board and leaving tonight. Good. My plan works perfectly. While I am now going to Melida, to take care of the duke and his daughter, you will take care of my brother. After you take him out of the game, I expect to see you in Africa. Don't worry, sir. The moment I set foot in Melida, you will know that the position of governor is free and that the city is waiting to receive you. Thanks ! You're hungry, huh? Give me some. Tie them up and take them down. Come on ! Hurry up ! The sails up! Get on the boat! Come on, sea wolves! Put the bone to work! More powerful! More powerful! Rowing! Let me ! MELIDA A Spanish gentleman has arrived and wants to be received by you. Sir, if you will allow me to express my humble opinion - As for this spa ... - No need, Selim. I know what you mean. Such a man would betray his mother too, if that were to his advantage. Yes, he is a traitor. Take good care of him. That's exactly what I'm thinking. But in this case, it makes me more than suspicious. I'm sure he's following his own plan. Of course. But I have a plan too, in which he also plays a small part. Your palace is lovely. See you again in the circumstances, which are much nicer than your dungeon, sir. Welcome, my friend. The palace is at your disposal. I want you to enjoy the hospitality of our friends, since you already know the one reserved for our enemies. At least in part. Yes, if that is possible, I wish nothing was known about me. - What news do you bring from Malaga? - Bad news ! My brother flatly refuses to pay the reward you ask for the duke and his daughter. But this is the opposite of what you guaranteed me before I released you. Yes I know ! But it seems that my noble brother is not as generous as you would have liked. With great bitterness, I learned that he would not move a finger - prevent you from killing them. - Seriously ? What makes you think I'm going to let them die? But I thought ... I thought I was going to ... That is, after the sacrilege committed by the Duke of Malaga and now that the reward has been denied. Well... You don't have to worry. I am moved by such great care for their safety. It's so unexpected. I decided to spare their lives. Your generosity is amazing. It's the most pleasant surprise. There will be other surprises, Ramiro. I know you're not going to get bored in Melida. Antonio, come on! Get down, we're here! Their ! Their ! Haide! That's right! Jump up ! - How are you feeling? - Like a lion! Good ! Here you go ? Is this a lion? Aia-i a mea. But I just took this one. Take one more. Now I'm going to show you how to open them. Look ! A drink for the lion. Here we are! Thanks ! Thanks ! Thanks ! - She is my girlfriend ! - Your girlfriend ?! Of course. These were hers. Let's see ! Once upon a time there was a bad monkey, who struck a sage with a coconut - and who got so angry ... - Are you thirsty? See, that's his face. See ? Yes, but I'm also hungry. Antonio, you know we have to leave right away, if you want to get to Melida tonight. What happens ? Antonio, take a seat. But they were very hospitable. Let me take care of that. More fun. Come on, move! Get moving! Can I help you with something, buddy? There are two people downstairs. One of them is Maciste. Why not try something? They will kill you if you give them a chance. Master, there are two Spaniards out there and he asks to be received by you. What do you think they want? I think you'd better leave. My friend and I are grateful you received us. What is the purpose of your visit here? It's very simple. Thanks. We're looking for a girl! Some time ago your people, obviously without you giving orders, attacked a monastery in Spain, off the coast of Malaga, and they kidnapped a girl. We came to get her back. You're crazy. As you say, sir! Anyway, I'll find that girl at any cost, even if I'm going to have to rummage through your palace, room by room, then I'll take her with me to Spain. That's not very clever. You think it's a secret I have the girl here and that I wouldn't let you see her? Zuleima, my beautiful, let her know that two Spaniards want to "save" her. What you managed to do really surprises me. Your king is in danger. Do something or you'll lose. I play to win. Isabella... "Antonio, I can't believe it!" - We came to set you free, Isabella. But I'm not a prisoner anymore. "Then there's no problem." "You can come with us now." But I don't want to leave here. What do you mean? Do you want to stay? But, Isabella, Antonio came here just for you. - I want to stay at the palace. - Isabella, what did they do to you? I'm not under their influence. I found out I like living here. Isabella, did you forget we made a promise to each other? I've found some things I've dreamed of all my life here. - You have to break the promise. - It's unbelievable that ... I would never have thought that you, of all people you will be overwhelmed by beautiful clothes and palaces. That's not all. You see, I'm going to marry the sheikh. - I suggest you go back to Spain. - But ... La cai ! I confess that your actions confuse me and I am intrigued and outraged by this unexpected generosity. Don Ramiro, if you think I'm generous, I have my reasons. There's a chance that by allowing the two of them to leave, the news she has about Mrs. Isabella, the girl I kidnapped from the monastery in Malaga, to reach the ears of your people. By the way, I'm going to marry her. Believe me, my brother, he will be unhappy. I imagine how surprised he will be. He will be even more surprised when I arrive in Malaga, with Isabella and her noble father, to become the possessor of the duchy, which is my right. Almost a century later, I will again dominate those lands that belonged to my ancestors. Let no one stand in the way of my ambition. "Those horses weren't worth much." "I paid even less for these." Okay, come in! Good. Good. Who are you ? "Let him through, I know him well." - It can pass. We need to find another way to get in. We could be recognized. Look over there ! That seems like a good idea. I don't think that's a good idea either. But he still did not give up hope. I need to talk to Isabella at all costs. I don't care, but I have to go into that palace. Yes Yes i know. Look ! Get moving! Get moving! Let's go ! Are you ready ? Let's go ! Come on in, take a look! You two, there! Come on ! Be careful where you put those big feet. You almost broke my leg. - Sorry ! "What do you mean you're sorry?" I was sleeping when ... Protest. This is my cell. I've always been alone here. Move these two elsewhere. Shut up, Grandpa. You heard me ? I swear I've seen you before. - That was close ! - You two, listen to me. I don't want anything to do with you. I don't care who you are. - Did you understand ? - Yes, I understood ! Everyone here does their job. Did you understand ? And who doesn't care about his job, well, we'll teach him a lesson. Good night ! Let me try too! Let me try too! Congratulations ! Good job. Just push with your shoulder. I think that will be enough. May. Then we'll have the surprise advantage. - Yes I know. - Looks like everyone's asleep. Hey, what about me? I do not sleep. Does the spirit that unites all prisoners mean nothing to you? Come here, make yourself comfortable, without asking me, then leave. "But you wanted to be alone!" "And we respect that!" I mean, do you want to go and let me turn the straw around here? - Why ? - Okay, you can come with us. - What's your name? - Maciste. Maciste ? Wait. You'll never get out of here. Not. Listen to me! 30 years ago, when I was young and beautiful, like you, and a little crazy like you I traveled from Naples to Ireland. My name is Jonesy Fitzpatrick. I'm always told here, Ali. Don't you want to take these down from me? My goal was to try to get into the sheikh's room. But fate was against me that night. It was nice to go in, but I couldn't get out. Sin. But now that you've helped me, I want to help you too. - How? - Pay attention to me. Some time ago, I made a hole in the floor. Of course, I covered it. With no strength for a young man, I could not move the stone. Maybe you can. Finally, I started digging day and night. How far have you come? Maciste, come down and you'll see. Easy! Easy! Easy. Be careful not to get injured. Careful. It's a long way down. Hi ! Hi ! That's where you get under the wall. - And the windows are on this side. - But not now. We are free now! We are free now. You managed ! You managed ! Enough, Maciste! I can get in there! Okay, okay, okay, okay. Let's go ! Let's go ! We'd better get out of here before they find out we're gone. No, no, not yet. That's right, we must first fulfill our mission, Ali. - The mission ?! - Yes. What mission? I have no mission! We came here to release a girl held captive in the harem. - Harem ?! - Yes, in the harem. A girl ? I'm coming with you! In fact, I'll show you the way. Follow me! Around here ! I remember the first time I came to this tunnel. I stopped right here. I could hear them singing and dancing. I assure you that you can hear everything. There must be a path somewhere around here. Maybe it's there. " I know you're happy to see me." - Look, there's a door here. I'd love to spend all day with you too. - But state issues call me. - It's the sheikh's voice. - My tempters ... - Tempting. Beautiful, wonderful, so graceful and agile. I'll be back, I promise. - He left. - Now is the time. "Let me go first." - No, no, no, wait a minute. I waited 30 years after that. You have to let me go first. And besides, you could scare them. - After you. "Thank you, Maciste!" "Tempting women!" - He's crazy. Tempting women! Come to Ali. I'm Ali yours. Very funny. What ? Ali, what happened? - What happened ? - They grew up. That doesn't sound scary to me. It's not my fault. Why are you looking at me like that? Leaves ! Look at that part. There should be. Let's hope there are no more lions. Not ! Don't run! We don't want to hurt you. We are friends. Listen to us! No, there will be no need. Don't be alarmed. You came to save that girl. - We want Isabella. "If we only knew where he was." It was a shorter path for you. I have ordered a slave to follow you secretly and bring you to me. but, unfortunately, you got involved with the prisoners. Maybe you can show us the shortest way. Follow me! I'll show you why he lied. She was forced to marry the sheikh. I told you Isabella wasn't honest. Wait a minute ! Why do you want to help us? I love the sheikh. Now, calm down! I go first. You're waiting here, Ali. If you see anyone, let us know. Isabella, are you? No, unfortunately not. These people are from Spain. They came to save your daughter. Thank you friends ! You are the Duke of Malaga! - Here you go ? - Yes. Everyone thinks I'm dead! After so many years, the sheikh found out who the prisoner was. He wanted to order his death. That's why Isabella lied. To save his father's life, he will marry the sheikh. The engagement party begins. Please tell us where Isabella is hidden. It will be presented to the sheikh immediately. You have to hurry if you want to save her. Follow the corridor. She'll be there, in the hallway where she'll be received. Leave, I'll be fine. Leaves ! We will use the same system he used with the robbers. - What's that? - A bag. - I'm dying of thirst! - It's a fever, Dad! Do you want to give me some water? We're leaving soon. I assure you of that. I will not return to Spain. - I'm exhausted. "Don't think so." Excellency, Isabella and I ... - She wants us to get married. - Yes. I didn't know who was at the convent, nobody knew. That doesn't matter now. But I'm not a nobleman! You are more worthy than anyone. Finally, we can be together and be happy. Antonio, I'm scared. I would have lived a nightmare if it weren't for you and my dad. Isabella ! I'm Don Ramiro's man. I want you to tell me where you hid Isabella. Speaks ! Tell me! That's how you'll end up. I have a better idea of ​​how you should die. Spoke ? Maciste, he has more courage than you. Excuse me, sir, but I think we need to go now. Now that your idiot brother is dead, you are expected to return to Malaga. I don't want to be received by the old duke and his daughter. It is very important that we find them before we leave. Let's go ! Has not reached ? Don't worry, she's been through even worse. You don't know the sheikh's intelligence and cunning. You don't know Maciste either! It is truly invincible! Now ! No one in this world is invincible. And now, tell me who you are? Luis, your friend. I'm glad to see you here ! Not as happy as I am, I assure you. I'd like to know who to thank. I am, Ramiro de Alvarez. You are the governor's brother. And so to speak, his secret envoy to Africa, whose purpose is to make your mission as easy as possible. - Seriously ? - Sir, you will give the order to leave, because only you know where we can find our friends. If all goes well, it should be in the fishing village. Beyond that huge rock. Let's hope Antonio manages to find a boat. I think the whole region is already being searched by the sheikh's soldiers. Don't worry about it. The ship I came with He's waiting for me on the shore. - Oh, that's good! - I'll take care of that, sir! Thanks, Luis! "Are Antonio and the others in the village?" - They're all here. Thank heavens for that! - Such as ? - The old Spaniard had a fever, but he has healed and is now much better. You were all very kind and brave. I don't know how to thank you for the inconvenience. I heard everything. But I don't think it's of any use, that I came to the village with you. I'd better get to my ship as soon as possible, and get ready to leave immediately. It seems logical to me. Tell me, where exactly is the ship? Under the rock, near the ruins of the Roman temple. "I'll be waiting for you there at dawn." - Okay, see you at dawn. Thanks ! Are you sure this is the place he was referring to? Yes, but where is he? We will wait for him! I've never seen a place with such beautiful birds. Look ! Isabella ! Don't move or the girl is dead. My mission is complete. With your permission, I'm going back to my ship now. It's a very wise decision. Because at dawn, there will be no Spaniards alive in my country. I find it ironic, that I came back from where I left off. I'm the only one responsible for all this. It would have been wiser to forgive, not to land in this country with a mad desire for revenge. Unde and, Isabella? Did you want to talk to me? What do you want? How do I address my husband? With a master, of course! Master, I humbly ask you to forgive me and allow me to live here as your wife. Tell me, how many lives do you want in return? Two? Three? Seven? Or all the Spaniards I can find in Africa? Or maybe those in Malaga? You know how many. It's an exchange I can't make. You better get this in your head. Stop it! Forget the chains. Antonio ! Don't sit there like that! Help him! No, don't touch it. The hands of the unbelievers have been defeated. The hands of the unbelievers will lift him up again. - Maciste, please help him! - It's good. Don't worry, I'll take it. The obelisk will avenge me. What an end for Maciste. If he had succeeded, it would have been more than a victory. The sacrilege would have been paid for. Mulțumesc, Maciste ! I give you all freedom. Upon arrival in Spain, send my greetings to Don Ramiro de Alvarez. Listen, listen: Excelena Sa, don Ramiro de Alvarez, to celebrate the happy occasion of his election as Duke of Malaga, calls on the public to take a break in the morning, for the early and recent death of the late Governor, Don Alfonso and gather in the marketplace, where wine and food will be distributed to all. Listen, listen: Excelena Sa, don Ramiro de Alvarez, to celebrate the happy occasion of his choice ... Luis, what's going on? Why don't the festivities begin? Everything is ready, but the city is deserted, sir. Look out! It's weird. There's no one on the street. It's as if everyone is mourning your brother. I would never have believed that my brother is so loved by the people. The Duke of Malaga is alive. Be that as it may, it seems that the people love me too. Warn the guard commander to prepare an escort to accompany me to the ceremony. Luis ! Luis ! Commander, answer me! Where the hell are you? Why the hell doesn't anyone answer me? Answer! Luis ! Luis ! Now, Antonio! I'll take care of that! Stay still or I'll stop you with a bullet. I told you to stay put! This time, your power won't help you with a gun. Don Ramiro, are you sure a bullet can hurt me? But you are not immortal! Well, then, shoot! But do not forget, if there's anything you're saying, you only have one bullet. Now ! Now ! Now ! Stop it! Stop it! You heard me ? Finally, we are alone. Nothing can stop us from getting married now. Macist greetings from our Emperor. You must help us in the war against the Mongols. Well, I'm not very good at Chinese, but ... Now !
