Waterworld Extended Edition Ulysses Uncensored Cut English MALE NARRATOR: The future... The polar ice caps have melted, covering the earth with water. Those who survived have adapted... to a new world. (GARGLING)... (METAL CLANGING)... (WHISTLES)... (SPEAKING HINDI) Bad luck, English. But the Slavers are producing a good grade of poxy these days. Cost you a handful of dirt or maybe that wind chime. What are you doing here? Just waiting. Take your hand off the sail. Take it off. I've seen your boat before. Haven't seen you. Took it legal. Previous owner was dead on the tiller when I found it. You had another hour before I traded up again. Just improving my means. Well, I owe you then. No, thanks. I got all the supplies I need. Just came from an atoll. Eight days east, if you're interested. Two Drifters meet, something needs to be exchanged. I know the code. But I'll give you this one for free. Nothing's free in Waterworld. Yeah. (MOTORS WHIRRING) Smokers. Just enough wind to get away clean. DRIFTER: Forget the bag. It's not worth it. You'll never make it with your sails down. Hey. (MIMICKING GOBBLING) What can I say? (LAUGHS) Joe, he's going for it. What the hell? Never seen that before. Here we go. Go. Drive. Drive. Faster. Faster. (WHOOPING) Come on. He's gonna get it. He's gonna get it. Go. Get him. Get him. (CONTINUES SHOUTING)... (GRUMBLES ANGRILY) No. No. (GRUNTING)... (SMOKERS SHOUTING)... (MACHINE GUNS FIRING)... (DRIFTER GROANS) No. (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)... (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE) How many ways can I say it? Go on, hit the swells. What do you think? He does have a bush on him. Cut a side barter if you want, but don't open the gates. Inbound. Straight out. English. Flag's down, Drifter. We got enough traders. (PEOPLE MURMURING) WOMAN: What does he have? Dirt. Open the gates. (PEOPLE CHATTERING) MAN: Bones to berries. Veins to vine. These tendons to trees. This blood to brine. Too old she was. This woman does leave us, recycled and enshrined... in the presence of him who leads us. (CHILDREN CHATTERING)... (BOYS WHINING) BOY: What is that? You know me? I know what you are. Good. Then you know if you look for trouble while you're here, you'll find more than you can handle. You got two hours. I'll only need one. He's coming over here. Me. You each get one... if everything's here when I get back. Pure dirt. (OTHERS EXCLAIMING)... 3.2 kilos. How'd you come by so much of it? Another atoll 30 horizons west of here. Where'd they get it? They didn't say. MAN 1: We heard about that place, that they was all killed. That's why they didn't say. Smokers? Maybe Smokers, maybe Slavers. So what's the word? We trading or not? We'll tally it like pure hydro. Works out to 62 chits. I want twice that. (PEOPLE MURMURING) You drive a hard bargain. Dirt? I have never seen purer. HYDROHOLIC: I just want one sip of hydro. NORD: No, not till you tell me. She got inkings on her back. I seen her. They say if you read the marks on the child, they'll lead you all the way to Dry land. Dry land's a myth. Some still believe. They say the Smokers even got an eye out for her. Well, then, we'd better keep it to ourselves. Help you? Yeah. Where's the store? You found it. You don't have much. You the man with the dirt? I'll take a hydro. All six G's. Got any canvas? Line? Well, we've got line. It's hair. No canvas. I'll take the line. Any seeds? Nope. Wood? Nope. Magazines? If I had a magazine, I'd retire. Something to drink? Cup of hydro. Pure. Skoal. One more. Make it two. A man this rich will buy for a fellow outwater, I'm sure. One. That's an interesting pair of boots you got. Trade? No. So, how long you been out there, man? Don't hurt asking. Talking costs you nothing. Depends. What lunar is it? Well, let's see. Abbo, Farch, June... It's August. It's August? Yep. So, how long? Fifteen. NORD: Fifteen lunars? That's her. HELEN: Enola. Hey, what are you doing? No, you can't do that. I need another piece. L want to draw some more. I'll give it to you. Just stay in the back. With all those chits, you could order up a bath. Have you ever had a... freshwater bath? Why are you talking to me? Just being friendly. Is that a tomato plant? Yeah. You have a keen eye. Saw one in a picture. How much? Half your chits. I'll take them, too. Take what? You bought everything. I'll take them shelves. So, what did you see out there in your 15 months? Such as? An end to all this water. Asking the wrong person. BOY: Where did he come from? The one they buried today? Uh-huh. She found the only end there is. I've got a proposition for you, Mariner. I'm not bargaining, I'm leaving. But you haven't even heard anything yet, or seen it. You may have noticed us burying a citizen today. That makes room for one more. I'm not staying. We're not asking you to. All we want is your seed. ELDER: We can look to our own for impregnation, but too much of that sort of thing gets undesirable. When she's pregnant, you go on your way with all the supplies you need. You don't have anything. You're dying. No man stays out that long and turns down a woman. He's hiding something. Maybe he's a Smoker spy. (WHISTLING) When the elders say so, you can leave, and not before. (GRUNTING) Gills. Mutation. He's a mutant. (PEOPLE SHOUTING) MAN: (GROANING) My hand. (SCREAMING)... (PEOPLE CLAMORING) MAN: Don't let him get in the water. MAN 2: Throw the nets. MAN 3: He's a murderer. (GRUNTING) By what right... You pay me to keep the peace. This isn't it. No. He has killed one of ours. He was defending himself. He needs to be destroyed. Kill him. Let's kill him. That may be, but not here and not like this. BOY 1: What is it? BOY 2: Damn. They're too tight. L can't get it off. Open the gate. This is another device we found on the boat. A garrote cord, for strangulation. We don't know what this is all about, but we believe it to be some sort of torturing device. And this... And this is a spy tool, for listening to the unsuspecting. (ALL MURMURING) The evidence speaks for itself. I move that we dispense with the mute-o as soon as possible, and in no way... Why? Why not use him? Because he is a threat to the safety and the purity of this atoll. He is not a threat, he's in a cage. He killed one of ours, however. (ALL CLAMORING) ls he dangerous or not? I'd say he is now. Well, but he came in here with all this dirt, the likes of which we haven't seen in years, not since Enola came. Oh, what about it? So it had to come from somewhere. What if it came from Dry land? Oh, don't start. He came from the west, I can tell you that. Locusts come from there. I've been told that. From the west. But if he is a spy, this ichthyo-man... will give away our position, our weaknesses. And if he isn't? But he's still a mute-o, and he can contaminate our community. And others. What others? We haven't seen or heard from another atoll in over a year. Let's keep to the issue at hand. No, this is the issue at hand. Every year, every month, it gets worse. There are fewer atollers, fewer traders. Dead gardens, these windmills that don't work, desalinators that can't be fixed. This place, this whole way of living, it's ending. Doesn't anyone else see that? When I was a boy, there were lots of atolls. You keep on praying for help, and now one man comes here... who might actually be able to save us... He's not a man. It doesn't matter what he is. I say, if he knows the way to Dry land, make him show us where it is. People have looked for centuries, and death is all they found. Well, at least they died trying. It's a hoax, and the sooner you realize that, Helen, the better off we're all going to be. We'd be better off if we got rid of that girl of hers, too. Right. ALL: Yeah. The Smokers are looking for her. L heard it from a trader. (ALL CLAMORING) One matter at a time. I say get rid of both of them. The mute-o and the girl. Yes. Yes. (ALL CLAMORING) Order. Order. Quiet down. (HUMMING) You'd like this, wouldn't you? Stick him. Sure is quiet... from the shark that he was this afternoon. Maybe we hurt him. Come on, let's go. No. Stick him again. I know you want it. I know. Maybe he don't need his own kind. (SCREAMING)... (MAN EXCLAIMING) That's it. (LAUGHING) That's it. Don't move, my dear. And from Aries to Taurus, I forgot Taurus, the bull, and in the shoulder of the bull, the Pleiades, the Six Sisters. Well, Seven Sisters, but you can only see six. But at the beginning of each lunar, one of the sisters is perpendicularly lined up with Scorpius. And the Scorpius has a tail just like the arrow, and that arrow bisects the circle, like on the back of the child. Now, if I take into account the seventh sister, and I give the seventh sister a lunar, well, then that lunar, it will run perpendicular to Scorpius, creating against the dawn horizon a straight line that would run directly... Directly toward... Dry land. No. Is it a map? Is it a calendar? Is it symbols? Ls it language? You'd tell me if you knew, wouldn't you, Enola? Mmm-hmm. What are you drawing? I don't know. Helen, look. Look at the prodigal child's latest vision. (CHUCKLES) We've got to get out of here. I take it the meeting didn't go well. They're putting us adrift, Gregor. L can feel it. No, no, they're not going to hurt you. I'd turn their lights off if they did. How soon before we can go? Another week, ideally. We don't have a week. Helen, I don't have any idea yet where we can go. Try your books again. The books? There's... There's nothing in them. There's nothing there. I've been through the books. There's nothing in these books. She is the Annunciation. I know it. I just don't know how. I'm a stupid man. The answer's right there. It's just beyond me. Maybe he knows. Yes, I see. They are webbed. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten digits. That's wonderful. They tell me, too, that you have gills. Isotropic gills. Are they merely vestigial or are they functional? My name is Gregor. I've just come to pay you a little... Oh, my God. (GREGOR LAUGHING) I'm sorry. I'm not laughing at you. I'm excited. Your gills, they're functional. Ichthyus sapien. You can breathe in the water. How deep can you go? Look, I'm only here because I want to learn more about you. You don't like humans very much, do you? I can't say that I blame you. But tell me, are all of your kind as bad-tempered as you are? I have no kind. Oh, fish rot. I'd be surprised if there weren't others, and if there aren't, there will be eventually. Anyway, I've come here because I need to ask you a question. Where did your dirt come from? Is it from Dry land? Do you know what this is? The ancients, they did something terrible, didn't they? To cause all this water. Hundreds, hundreds of years ago. If I tell you, will you open this lock? I haven't a key. There's a mooring cleat down there. What? Good as any key. A mooring cleat? I won't hurt anyone. I'll just leave. I'll be right back. MAN: Gregor. What's your business there? Move along. I'm not a brave man. If you know anything about Dry land, please tell me. Please. Don't let it die with you. No, no, no, no. Stop. MAN: Gregor. Move along. (BELL TOLLING)... (FOOTSTEPS) Get out of the way. ELDER: After considerable deliberation of the evidence at hand, it is our decision that this mute-o does, indeed, constitute a threat. Therefore, in the interest of public safety, he is hereby sentenced to be recycled... in the customary fashion. Proceed. I'm sorry. Bones to berries. Veins to vines. These tendons to trees. This blood to brine. Too strange for life he was. This mute-o now does leave us, recycled and entombed, in the presence of him who leads us. In the presence of him who leads us. Smokers. Get out of the sun. To your posts. (PEOPLE CLAMORING) WOMAN: Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Kill. There. (SHOUTING) We are safe behind this wall. Aren't we? Let me out. Let me out. I'll fight. Help me. I can't find my dad. He's probably on the wall. Now, go in there, get a weapon and fight. Go. Go now. Go. Go, go. Come on, boys. I said move it. Come on. Go. Go. Go. (SMOKERS SHOUTING) Give me the key to the city now. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Floor it. Floor it. Come on. (WOMAN SCREAMING) Swab it. Swab it. More ammo. SMOKER: Break down the door. My God. (GRUNTING) Go to work now. We'll have this atoll in no time. Crank it. Crank it. Look. MAN: Look out. (GRUNTS) Oh, no. Oh, my... Helen. Keep that gas going. Fill them up. (SCREAMING) It's the girl they want. Give them Enola and they leave. Come quickly. Helen. Helen. (GUN FIRING)... (MEN SCREAMING) You're not supposed to go yet. Infernal machine. Damn you. Infernal machine. Gregor. Gregor, wait. Helen, I tried. There was an accident. I couldn't make it stop. Hurry. You can make it if you try. Run. Please, stop. Up those stairs. Run. Quickly. Wait. Wait. I'll throw you a rope. Run quickly. Throw the rope now. Run, Enola. ENOLA: Slow down. Wait. No. No. Wait. Gregor, don't leave us. Oh, no. I'm sorry. Lt was an accident. Helen. Enola. Helen, I'm sorry. (GUN FIRING) Shoot him. Shoot him. If I let you out of here, you're taking us with you. Sure. HELEN: Enola, get down. Here. Get over here. Get down. Hurry. Come on. Get the gate. (GUNS FIRING)... (GRUNTING)... (GRUNTING) Hurry up. Kamikaze. Come on. (PEOPLE SCREAMING) That made a hole. Find her. Get the girl. There. Go get that guy. Go. Kill him. Wow. Enola. MARINER: You're too slow. Run to the other side. Come on. Grab on. Hold on, hold on. It's stuck. L can't make it through. Let her go. Just drop her. Turn the wheel. The wheel. Turn it. That. Come on. Push it. I am. Hurry. Now pull. Push it. Push it hard. Push it. Okay, okay. Now pull this. Pull this. Go. Go. Pull it. Pull. Enola, jump. Jump. Look at me. Jump. Now. Okay. Well, excuse me. Did I say anybody could leave before the battle was over? Did I? No. No. Well, do something. I hate sails. Hey. Can you steer? Can I trust you? (ROPE CREAKING WITH TENSION) Answer me this, somebody. Why is that boat still firing? What's that cousin's name? Chuck. Hey, Chuck. He's pulling him right into us. Maybe he doesn't answer to Chuck. Call him Charles. Charles. Stop him. Stop him. Charles. Adios, cousins. WOMAN: Put me down. Put me down. She's here somewhere. Keep looking. (MOTOR REWING) Yes, I'll... 660 G's of hydro, three-quarter grade or better, 120 keys of assorted edibles, jerk fish and plankton cakes, 60 keys lamp oil, 44 old-growth grape vines, 10 assorted fruit trees, zero reloads, no animal storage on this particular atoll, zero go-juice, no refining capability. Primitive savages. How about smokes? Zero. Zero smokes. I remember when this used to be fun. How long's it been since we had a really good crusade? I know, I know. Tell me, how long? I don't know. l... Remember, there used to be atolls on every horizon? Mmm-hmm. Where the hell are they all going? Well, we sunk a few. Found this. Nord? Oh, now that's warmer. Hey, all right. And the girl? She's not here. She might have gotten away. That's why we came here. We didn't come here to practice. We don't need practice. MAN: It's too late now. Never mind. (PEOPLE CLAMORING) What you got? Couple of heartbeats over there. Aren't saying much. If you'll notice the arterial nature of the blood coming from the hole in my head, you can assume that we're all having a real lousy day. So here it is, I need to know about that tattooed girl. First one that tells me lives. I saw a girl. L saw... Lt was... She had a big tattoo on her. I saw a girl. I'm not sure, but I think she got on that boat with three hulls. The boat that cost me 1,000 G's of go-juice? Yeah, the mute-o's boat. Mute-o? Yeah. He got these slits here. Like fish gills. He wasn't really a man. A fluke of evolution. Oh, I'm sorry. A fluke of... Evolution. L know. Let's have an intelligent conversation here. I'll talk, and you listen. In the beginning, the provider said, 'Let there be water, ' and the seas came forth. He created everything that we know. Hey. Hey. Get in here. The sun, the air that we breathe. He made, also, both man and fish, and no combination thereof. He does not abide the notion of evolution. Amen. ALL: Amen. No. No, you said you wouldn't kill me. Did I say that? Witnesses, anybody, did I? Yes, yes, yes. You said... You said it. Oh, I may have. I may have. (Screaming) We get to the 'Deez, tank up that sky boat, send it out on patrol. We gotta keep an eye out for that ichthy-freak. I know what you're thinking. Thinking how much longer that hydro'd last if there weren't three of us on this boat. Well, Enola won't drink much. And I won't... I won't drink at all. Not till we get there. Get where? I don't know, wherever you're going. Wherever you got your dirt. Told you before, I salvaged it off an atoll the Smokers hit. Smokers don't leave anything after a raid, especially dirt. You been there, haven't you? Dry land? You know where it is. Yeah, I know where it is. And... And we're going? You and I are. The kid we gotta pitch over the side. What? My boat's tore up. I'm taking on water. I'd be lucky to get half a hydro ration out of that. You know... l said I won't drink. For 12 days? No. It's better one of you dies now than both of you die slow. Wait. Wait. We saved your life. We got you out. No, you got me out so you could get out. We're even. She can cook. She can fish. So can l. Then take my necklace. Take my necklace. I got better ones below. No, look. After what you went through back there on the atoll, I can understand why you would want to. But she's a child. (HUMMING) ls there something else, then? Enola. Go below. Enola. Yeah. You said so yourself. Been out there a long time. Couple hours ago, I was potential dirt to you. We're not like that. You all are. Know what I was really thinking? Why I don't drop both of you in my wake right now. You got nothing I need. You're taking us to Dry land. Killing's a hard thing to do well. Believe me. I'm not the one to start on. Both of us. How long you plan to hold that on me? As long as it takes. Okay. No. HELEN: Let me out of here. Coward! Don't you touch my child. Come here. (HELEN GRUNTING) No. Don't hurt... Okay, now, don't move, okay? There. Oh, looking real good, yeah. There. There. All done. Now, there may be some small problem in depth perception. Well, it better not screw up my short game. Well? Looks good. L like it. Yeah. I like it better than your real eye. Much better. What do you say, Toby? The truth. Looks like shit. That's why I love children. No guile. It does look like shit. And it feels like cold shit. Deacon? What... I'm sorry. It's just that there's a problem in the pit. Maybe you should come. Let's drive. (PETER GUNN THEME SONG PLAYING) The pit. Don't bother with the scenic route. Drive. Hey, it's driving better. Get off. Get off. Get out of the way. All right, all right, all right. Okay, okay. Bless you, cousins. Bless you. Bless all you cousins over there. Keep up the good work. Growth is progress. Growth is progress. DEPTH GAUGE GUY: Somebody. Hey, up there. Take it off. Yes. Your Deaconship. Hello. Good morning. Or night, whichever the case may be. What is it? I'm a busy man. I thought you should know. We're down to exactly four feet, nine inches... of black stuff. Thank you, sir. How many G's is that after refining? Maybe three refuelers. We'll burn through that in two lunars. Sweet Joe. Will somebody please tell me what's happening to this place? We outgrowed it. All right, the only thing that is important is the tattooed girl. We don't spare any go-juice finding her. We don't waste it anywhere else. You cancel all those tractor pulls and all that stuff until later. You got it? Dry land is the mother lode. On your toes. Why don't you use sea hydro? Salt's harder on the filters. Can we have some? It's for her, not me. Here, come on. Is he going to take use to Dry land? Sure he is. Yeah. All of it. All of it. All of it. Good. Good, good. Come on. Thanks for not killing us. Just stay away from him. Hi. Move. HELEN: Enola. Enola, come here. Come on. Enola, come over here. Hey. What are you doing? Decorating your boat. It's ugly. Where did you get this? From down below. This is mine. You don't touch anything of mine. I drew it for you. You don't draw on anything. You understand? This is my boat. L got it the way I like it. You take up space and you slow me down. You know, she's just a little girl. She doesn't know your rules. You wanna stay? You teach her. HELEN: Enola, what'd I tell you? You're not so tough. You know that? How many people have you killed? Ten? Twenty? You talk a lot. I talk a lot 'cause you don't talk at all. Now, how many? Including little girls? I'm not afraid of you. I told Helen you wouldn't be so ugly if you cut your hair. In fact, you talk all the time. It's like a storm when you're around. HELEN: Enola. Hey. What are you doing? Helen. You butcher. She can't swim. ENOLA: Help me. Helen. Helen, help me. Helen. Helen, help me. (GASPING) Helen. Helen. Hold on. Look at me. Look at me. Look at me. (GASPING) Oh, please, come back. Please. Please. Oh, please. (HELEN COUGHING VIOLENTLY) HELEN: Hey. Hold on. Okay, almost... Thanks. L swear, if you ever touch her again... son of a bitch. Look at me. You will go to bed that night and you will never wake up. Shut up. What? Smokers? Yeah. Can't we outrun them? Not with my sail down. What are you thinking about? That's a nice touch. That's them. Don't hit the kid. (LAUGHING DEVILISHLY) HELEN: Hey. Coward. (LAUGHING) Fuck! No. (GROANING) Joe. Cut it. Come on. Come on. (EXCLAIMING) All right. Okay. HELEN: Oh, I'm really sorry. I'm sorry. But you didn't give me much choice. Oh, I know. But you ran away. L... What? What are you... No. Please, no. No. (GRUNTING) Don't ever touch anything on my boat again. She said she was sorry. That means you're supposed to say something back. Did you say something? ENOLA: Mmm-mmm. DEACON: Fore. NORD: Nice putt. It wasn't a putt. That was a... drive. And I wasn't even using my good eye. Damn it. You got an ashtray or something? Oh, man. Damn thing never did work right. You said to bring the pilot. Yes, I did. Well, he's here. Well, why didn't you tell me? Come on, Nord. Come on, tell me about it. The child. Did he have the girl with him? Yeah, and some atoll bitch. They killed Ed. Now, now, don't you fret yourself. Plenty more where Ed came from. Heading west-southwest? From here. Seems to me if we launch now, we can cut him down just about here. If he doesn't change course. It's not likely. He's a wily one, that ichthy-demon. DRIFTER: Hello. Drifter? Mmm-hmm. Are we gonna stop? Look at the flag. His flag's up. I thought you all stopped for each other. (DRIFTER YELLING) Well, maybe he has some food. Don't find many who follow the rules anymore. Well, make it quick. What's your business? Trade. You got any resin? (CHUCKLING) Resin? He's gotta be out of his mind. He's out of his mind. L don't have any resin. You been outwater a long time, haven't you? Must be joking me, man. Resin. You don't got enough. How about food? Could you say that again, please? Could you say that again, please? How about food? Yeah, food. Yeah, that'd be good, eh? I haven't eaten in, well, you know, forever. Which one of you two is the cook? 'Cause I usually fall for the waitress. (SNICKERS) Like you said, I don't have much. I'll say. Let's see. I'll say. Let's see. We can start with that wee orchard you got over there. (EXCLAIMING) MARINER: All right, hold it there. We can talk. Fair enough. (MUTTERING) It's a nice rod, isn't it? I like that rod. It's a nice rod. Got yourself a wee harem going here, now, don't you, eh? What do you want for the women? We're not for sale. Not for sale? There's no such thing as not for sale. 'Not for sale'. Not for sale, eh? Are they a pair, or would you consider selling them separate? No. Our business is done here... unless you got some resin or sail you can part with. Unless you got some resin or sail you can part with. I told you once already, I don't have any. I don't have. Don't have. Don't have. Haven't seen either for trade in lunars now. Wait. Wait, wait, wait. I do have something that'll make you change your mind. Something that you can't pass on. (SNICKERING) (SNICKERING) I took it off an atoller refugee camp. The life savings of the entire clan. Paper. Look at my wee paper. It's paper. Have you ever seen paper? Look at it. It's paper. Have you ever seen paper? Look at it. Smell it. (SNIFFING) I been saving it for a special trade. Don't you do it. You know, maybe I'm talking to the wrong person here. Whose boat is this? Ls it your boat or your boat? No. No, it's his boat. But he doesn't own us. Half an hour. Is he out of his mind or something here? I got two pages in here, man. I mean, I'd get half a dozen girls with this, you know. I mean, I'd get half a dozen girls with this, you know. Half an hour. You trading or not? Don't. Shut up. Okay. Forty-five minutes with the wee one over there. I like to do the talking, if you know what I mean. No. No. Fair enough. Come, come, come, come, come. No. My boat. Fair enough. Fair enough. Good, good, good. Aye. Helen. Sit down. Enola, just do as he says. (SNICKERING) (SNICKERING) Half an hour. Come here, come here. It's been a while for me now. Guess it's been more than a while, actually. Guess it's been more than a while, actually. I've only got half an hour. Half an hour, half an hour, half an hour... Right, right, right... You're so beautiful. Aye. Anyone ever told you that? Give me that. What are you doing? It's just a game. Give me that. What are you doing? It's just a game. Oh, l... l... We was just playing. The trade's off. I changed my mind. Well, you can't do that. I mean, a deal's a deal, aye? I mean, a deal's a deal, aye? I just did. Hey. She's mine. Aye. No. No, no, I won't have it, no. Go on. Get, get, get. Go, go, go. Good, good. But don't go too far, now. This won't take but a minute. I hate this boat. I hate this boat. You garbage. You're pretty stingy for a man who's got everything, aren't you, now? You're pretty stingy for a man who's got everything, aren't you, now? (CLANGING) DRIFTER: You... Where's me boat? Where's me boat? Help me to me boat. (GROANING) Me boat. Yeah, if he knows he's been spotted, he'll expect us to expect him to change course, which is exactly why he'll keep his heading. The important question is, where's he heading? And does he know how precious his cargo is? And does he know how precious his cargo is? Dry land. Salvation. Room to grow. Eighteen holes. Thirty-six. Seventy-two. I say that he's headed here, and we take him here. How long before we get some wind? Days, maybe. Then why don't we fish? What for? So we can get something to eat? We ate two days ago. You ate. Just... Just help me fix this. I'll catch something myself. You're not going to catch anything with this around here. Look, we're not trying to make you angry. Look, we're not trying to make you angry. And you don't disappear just because you turn your back on us. You don't know what fishing's like around here. Well, then you do it, if you're the authority. Maybe he doesn't know how to fish. I think you're right, Enola. Shut up, will you? I'm trying to listen for engines. I will not shut up until you stop what you're doing... and you help me find something to eat for this child. I will scream so loud that... I will scream so loud that... HELEN: What the... No. Never catch anything with this. It's useless. HELEN: Look, I'm sorry. You were right about the pole. HELEN: Look, I'm sorry. You were right about the pole. You were right, but we have to eat. Now, I know you can hear me. Now, we can fish for ourselves. You show us what to do. You must know how. Even you gotta eat. You just sit there. What... I don't know. (SEA MONSTER ROARING)... (GUN FIRING) Happy now? (HUMMING) You don't like my singing, do you? Helen says you don't like my singing 'cause you can't sing. Ever try and listen? To what? The sound of the world. I don't hear anything. That's because you're too loud... and you're moving around all the time. Try sitting still. Eyeball? Go ahead, drink all you want. It's gonna rain tonight. I wish I had feet like his. Then maybe I could swim. Enola. (BURPS) Sorry. Never met a person who couldn't swim before. I can't. People said I was weird. Maybe they were right. Maybe they were right about you, too. (MUSIC PLAYING) ls that from Dry land? Yeah. (SIGHS) (SIGHS) You know, I don't even know your name. I don't need one. Enola wanted to give this to you. And this. And this. She won't take it again. You don't look much like her. Well, I'm not her mother, if that's what you're asking. You act like it. About six years ago, this basket floated into the atoll with Enola in it. Of course, everyone wanted to shove her back out to sea. That was the law. She was so precious. I wanted to keep her. So the elders talked and said that if I wanted her so badly... So the elders talked and said that if I wanted her so badly... that I could never have a child of my own. There was no one else. She would have died otherwise. So? It's called compassion. (SIGHS) You probably wouldn't understand, after being alone so much. You probably wouldn't understand, after being alone so much. I'm not alone. Got this boat for a friend. It don't lie to me, don't cut my throat when I'm asleep. Gives me a place to be. I pity you, really. What's pity? You don't know? If I knew, I wouldn't ask. Well, if you don't know, I could never make you understand. What are those marks on her back? Nothing. They're just fanciful things. Like what she draws? She draws what she sees. She's like a mirror. People on the atoll thought she was a... Freak? Yeah. I just thought she was special. I'm not giving it to her. It's just... A loan. Yeah. I'm not giving it to her. Is Dry land beautiful? You'll see. (ENOLA GIGGLING) Enola? Enola, what are you doing? Those monsters'll kill her. No, they're asleep now. Hands around my neck. Let the water tell your arms and legs how to move. We're going down. Hold your breath. What is it? What is it? Barter outpost. You said we'd get to Dry land today. Today. Tomorrow. What's it matter? I need resin. (SPEAKING PORTUGREEK) What is that? It's PortuGreek. Their own language. Or so I thought. (SNIFFING) There's my girl. Yeah. Howdy, darling. Come on in here now. What's going on? Smokers. What the hell? He's spotted us. Sound it. Sound it. Sound it. Sound it. Sound it. (WHOOPING) HELEN: Enola. (GUNS FIRING) Starboard side. Now. Get in the chair. Watch it. He's clearing the net. Go to the helm. Get the centerboard. Centerboard? What centerboard? Where, exactly? I don't know what to do. Under the helm. Pull the handle. Hurry. Hurry. It's too late. Over here. (SCREAMING) No. Give me that rifle. Boy, if you wanna do something right, you've got to do it yourself. All right. (GRUNTS) I winged him. I say we load all the go-juice onto one boat and run the freak down. You can't catch him in ten boats, and you wanna send just one? Well, I pray that you're joking. Bring me the trackers. (CHUCKLES) You lied to us. You were gonna sell us back there. We both lied. What? I saw what I saw. He's hurt. Well, he should be. He was gonna sell us. No wonder you let her keep it. No, you leave it. Why do they want her? You know, there's nothing human about you. They should have killed you the day you were born. They tried. No more lies. (SHRIEKING) What are the marks on her back? People say it's the way to Dry land. Dry land's a myth. No. You said so yourself that you know where it is. You did. You're a fool to believe in something you've never seen before. I've seen it. I've touched it. Dirt that was richer and darker than yours. It was in the basket we found Enola in. It doesn't exist. Well, how can you be so sure? Because I've sailed farther than most have dreamed, and I've never seen it. But the things on your boat. 'Things on my boat' what? There are things on your boat that nobody has ever seen. What are these shells? And that reflecting glass? (STUTTERING) And the music box? That... Well, if not from Dry land, then where? Where? You wanna see Dry land? You really wanna see it? I'll take you to Dry land. Get in. Well, what about Enola? There's only air for one. Get in the water. It'll be all right. Don't touch anything. Okay? I didn't know. All this time... I didn't know. Nobody does. (MOTOR REWING) Can you get us out of here? I'd say there're two chances of that. Hey. No way and no how. Should've bought me that drink. Come on. This way. Come on. (SMOKERS WHOOPING) DEACON: Proper introductions first. I'm the Deacon. If you don't recall the face, perhaps it's 'cause I didn't always look like this. Now, I suspect she's somewhere real close. So we can tear this boat apart looking for her, but I'd rather somebody tell me where she is. And the first one that does that lives. And the runner-up... Well, actually, there are no runners-up. Oh, sweet Joe, I love this part. Choose them. One, two. Live or die. You know, personally, I'd rather shoot the sperm-of-the-devil here. But you know something? I don't think you're gonna tell me, are you? Too bad. Come on. What do you say? She's not your kind. You don't even have a kind. If you say it, he'll still kill us both. (DEACON GRUNTING) Let's not get ahead of ourselves. If you don't tell me, I swear to Poseidon I will torch your boat. DEACON: Refresh my memory. What happens when neither of them talks? Never happened before. Never happened before. All right. If they won't tell us where she is, do them. Both of them. Kill them now. No. HELEN: No. So gullible. Bring her here. Take and ye shall receive. HELEN: No. Leave her. So ends your daily sermonette. (DEACON LAUGHING) Yes. Yes. Yes. (ALL CLAMORING) Here, take them, boys. Take care of her. What is it? Stunning. I don't have words to even begin to... It's magnificent. Look at that. That's square footage. All we gotta do is figure out this map. Turn her upside down. Does that mean anything to you? No. DEACON: We'll figure it out back at the 'Deez. Back at the 'Deez, boys. Careful with her. Careful with her. What about them? Do them both. Torch the boat. (GRUNTING) We have to go under. No, I can't breathe like you. I'll breathe for both of us. (GUNS FIRING) ENOLA: Helen. Helen, help. Helen. Helen. My boat. Enola. DEACON: All right. I can't wait to get this thing out on some pavement. Build some highways and some freeways. There you go, cous. There you go, cous. Be careful, now. You break them, you can't use them. Come on. What's happening, cousin? Not a word. She just sits there and leaks. Well, shiver to the liver. This'll make her give up all her secrets, huh? Yeah, or kill her. Let me talk to her first. I'm real good with kids. DEACON: What is this? Get those chains off her. What are we, barbarians here? Goodness gracious. Sakes alive. Come on, out of here, you big, nasty animal, you. Well, rub-a-dub-dub. You wanna come over here and sit on my lap? No? How about a cigarette? Nothing like a good smoke if you miss your mum. Never too young to start. No. Well, I got something right here I know you'd like. Like to draw, don't you? Now, they're yours, if you help me with just one problem, all right? Now, I got this parish. Good parish. Large parish. Getting larger all the time, in fact. Now, you know, I just don't have enough faith... for all these people. Why don't you make less people? Pardon? The atoll, babies are born only when there's room. That way, there's food and hydro for everyone. Well, that's a quaint suggestion. But it don't really play here, considering we are, in fact, the Church of Eternal Growth. See, what we need is more land, for more people. Now, that tattoo on your back. I've been told that that's actually a map? It's the way to Dry land. Now we're getting someplace. Could you teach me how to read that? Setback. Well, have you ever heard any of your friends talk about it? You know, like your mommy or your pet fish? Did he say anything? You shouldn't make fun of him. He wouldn't like it. Girl, I don't give a shit what he'd like. He took out my eye. And if I ever see him again, I'm gonna cut open his head and eat his brain. You think he'd like that? Can't kill him. He's even meaner than you are. But he's not here. And he ain't coming. And no one's gonna save you. He'll come for me. He will. Then you better tell me what I wanna know... or he can see what's left of you in a goddamn jar. Now, I'm glad we had this little talk. Chain her. Chain her up. He'll come for me. He'll take me away. We're going to die here, aren't we? Aren't we? After the atoll, when I offered myself to you, why didn't you take me? 'Cause you didn't really want me. Not really. Have I been asleep long? I was dreaming. It's funny. I always thought Dry land floated. That it drifted with the wind. That's why it was so hard to find. Why did you believe in it so much? Because we weren't made for the sea. Got hands and feet. We're supposed to walk. I miss her sound. Don't you? Might be able to get some hydro out of this. I can't go on. Not without her, or Dry land. I don't want to live if there's nothing left. There's no hope. You're still here. Thank you for saving me. You can thank the ancients. This is what they had. This is what they made of it. That's why I am what I am. I may not be human, but I don't quit. Never have. No matter what they throw at me, l... Helen. Helen. No, no, no. Helen, up here. Above you. (GREGOR GIGGLING GIDDILY) HELEN: Gregor. Smart thinking, to burn your boat. Without the smoke, I never would have found you. Who's that with you? Ichthyus sapien, is that really you? I'll throw the rope down. You catch it. I'll help you climb up. Helen. Where's Enola? Smokers took her. They'd have me, too, if it weren't for him. My friend, thank you. Very human of you. Well, grab your things quickly. Quickly. Come. GREGOR: You see? Right down there. There's several of us survivors. We'll just start over again. Don't worry, they'll welcome you, just like Gregor did. MAN: You can't ask us to go get her. WOMAN 1: Enola's the reason we're in all this trouble. WOMAN 2: Forget it. We're not going. HELEN: They don't have any reason to kill her. They need to find Dry land just like we do. Of course. HELEN: If the Mariner's willing to go, why not us? WOMAN 1: If he wants to go, then let him. WOMAN 2: We don't want you here. You or the girl. Helen. The papers the Mariner brought you... It's the same language the tattoo is written in. Eighty-six, 56, 27, 59... If I can figure out what these numbers refer to... They refer to nothing. What? Dry land doesn't exist. MAN: Gregor, you're as crazy as she is. WOMAN 1: We can't stay here. We're wasting valuable time. More Smokers will come. We need to be moving now. My friends, don't you see we need this child if we want to find Dry land? I'm not going. MAN: L say let them go. We're better off without them, anyway. You won't go after her, either? I thought you were different. L am different. MAN: Hey. Hey. That's my sail. What's he doing? Leaving. Not on one of our boats... You can give it to him, or he'll take it. Enola said you were her friend. What do I tell her when I see her again? Lies. If it makes you feel better. Don't blame him. Survival is all he knows. That's why someday there will be so many like him, and probably so few of us. What do you want? All kinds of things. But right now, we'll settle for everything you've got. Ain't that right, Bone? You've already destroyed our homes. Why can't you just leave us alone? I don't know. Character thing, I guess. Ain't that right, Bone? Bone? Bone? I'm going after Enola. You know, for a hideous freak, you're okay. It was a joke. Know what that is yet? GREGOR: What, the numbers? Yes, I think I do. It seems to be some ancient form of geographic location, latitude, longitude. It doesn't make sense, though. The numbers, they seem to be backwards or something. It's upside down. The world? The poles have reversed themselves? I've been mapping the cities below. The world wasn't created in a deluge. Lt was covered by it. MAN: That's blasphemy. No, it's true. I've seen it with my own eyes. There is land. It's right under our keel. None of it's dry anymore. Some is. Enola's been there. L know that now. L saw what she drew. So that's why he's going after Enola, to find Dry land! I don't care about Dry land! This is ridiculous. Going after the Smokers? He doesn't even know which direction they came from. If she's alive, I'll bring her back to you. WOMAN 2: Forget the mute-o, Helen. If he brings her back, they'll kill us all. I can't stand it. We gotta go help him. L can't ask him to do this alone. Oh, don't worry, my dear. You're not going to have to. Hey, Doc, what's this here? Where? Right there, above the squiggle. What, there? Looks like a star. Or a meteor. It's a mole. You got that tattoo figured out yet? It would be easier if it was flat, big and flat. It needs to be flat. What you got in mind? Well, you cut it off her back. You stretch it, mount it. Give us a proper look. DEACON: Take her down below until I holler. Saint Joe, we're close. After centuries of shame. (PEOPLE SHOUTING IN DISTANCE) They're getting ugly. Don't I know it. Announce me, cousin. Hey. Here he is. CROWD: Deacon. Rise up, brothers and sisters. Turn your eyes and open your hearts... to your humble benefactor, your spiritual shepherd and dictator for life, the Deacon of the 'Deez. (CROWD CHEERING)... (CROWD CLAMORING) Deacon. Children. Children of the provider. Citizens of the good ship. Please, now, hear me speak. I've had a vision. MAN: Yeah, we're tired of your visions. What about the land you promised us? Yeah. CROWD: Yeah. DEACON: Oh, ye of little faith. I've had a vision so great... that as it came to me, I wept. And in this splenditudinous figment of wonder... ls that Bone's ride? Is that blood on the seat?... l saw. And you know what it is that I saw. I saw the land. (ALL CHEERING) CROWD: Dry land. Dry land. Dry land. Dry land. (MUFFLED SCREAMING) CROWD: Dry land. Dry land. Dry land. Dry land. Dry land. Dry land. Dry land. Dry land. Horse, that you? (ENGINE REWING) Look, just bring it in slow, okay? L don't have all day. (ENGINE REWING) Horse. Just bring it up slow. I said slow. No. You killed Smitty, cousin. Nice landing. (MEN LAUGHING) Smitty, man. Always in the way. Smitty? L quit. I'm in charge now, baby. Come on, move. Move. I'm in charge. I'm in charge. No way. DEACON: And he said this to me personally. We are to go there, and we are to settle it. And we are to build a... Shouldn't be doing that. You're gonna get in trouble. That's right. You're not afraid. You've got your pet freak coming to rescue you. He's not a freak, and he can take you anytime. He's killed dozens of people, and he doesn't have any mercy or anything. He even kills little girls. Haven't we all? Dang. It's Horse. Horse? Find him. Find him. Come on. Yes. Yes. Yes. Come on. ENOLA: Getting nervous, aren't you? I don't get nervous. DEACON: And if there's a river, we'll dam it. And if there's a tree, we'll ram it. 'Cause I'm talking progress here. Yes, sir. I'm talking development. Yeah. For we shall suck and savor the sweet flavor... of Dry land. ENOLA: Your face is all red. Helen said with anybody that has a face that red, he's either had too much sun or too much to drink. All right, that's it. I'm gonna burn your face. DOCTOR: Almost time. What's up? We're just talking about her friend. NORD: What's his name? ENOLA: He doesn't have a name. So death can't find him. (MOCKING ENOLA'S TONE) Doesn't have a home or people to care for. He's not afraid of anything, men least of all. He's fast and strong like a big wind. He can hear 100 miles and see 100 miles underwater. He can hide in the shadow of the noon sun. He could be right behind you, and you won't even know it till you're dead. Give it a rest. He'll come for me. He will. DEACON: We are the reason. Yeah? Well, I hope he does. The Lord's creation. Remember you said that. DEACON: Look at us. Look at us here today. Yeah. Dry land is not just our destination, but it is our destiny. (ALL CHEERING) Find him. Find him. 'How can I find this glorious place?' And he said to me, 'A child shall lead you.' A child. And behold. It's time. The instrument of our salvation. (CROWD CHEERING) Our guide in the wild. Our beacon in the darkness. Turn her around, Nord. She has shown me the path. And before the holy-most moment is upon us, let's sacrifice one to old Saint Joe. And let's get this tub of shit up to speed. Yeah. (ALL CLAMORING)... (WHOOPING) Pull. Pull. Pull. Pull. ALL: Pull. (MEN GRUNTING) So which way we rowing? I don't have a goddamn clue. Don't worry. They'll row for a month before they figure out I'm faking it. But why? Oh, you want details. Well, I'm not telling these... savages that we haven't solved the map yet. I promised them results, and I'll get them if I gotta cut them out of her back. Who is that? Who is that? Maybe one of the spare rowers? Why aren't you rowing? It's him. Lt is him. You guys are in so much trouble. Well, I'll be damned. It's the gentleman guppy. You know, he's like a toilet that won't flush. I want the girl. You know, I thought you were stupid, friend. But I underestimated you. You're a total freakin' retard. I want the girl. That's all. Well, what on this screwed-up earth makes you think... you're gonna get her? You know what this is? I drop it, you burn. We all burn. Now, wait, wait, wait, wait. Let's not do anything rash here. I mean, are you sure she's worth all this? She never does stop talking. She never shuts up. I noticed. What is it, then? It's the map. She's my friend. Golly gee. A single tear rolls down my cheek. I mean, you're gonna die for your friend? If it comes to that. He's bluffing. I'll kill him. He's not bluffing. He never bluffs. Shut up. I don't think you're gonna drop that torch, my friend. Why not? Because you're not crazy. No. Oh, thank God. (MAN SCREAMING)... (MACHINE GUN FIRING) MAN 1: Look out. MAN 2: Look out. That's him. Let's go. Don't just stand there. Kill something. Was this your big vision? (EXCLAIMS) I've always wanted to drive this monster. There he is. There he is. That's him. There. (SCREAMS) ENOLA: Let go. Let go. I said, let go. Let me go. Let go. Let me go. Let go. DEACON: Pilot. Pilot. Let me go. Pilot. Let me go. Let go. You should've stayed underwater. (CLICKING) Now, you know how to fly an airplane? Lucky I do, huh? (SCREAMS) Now, you stop it. You behave yourself, now. (EXPLOSION) HELEN: It's going down. You can see it sinking. Gregor, bring us right down on top of it. Hurry, Gregor. GREGOR: Don't worry. Hurry. Enola. Up here. Grab on. GREGOR: Are they on yet? GREGOR: What is it? HELEN: L don't know. Got you. I'm gonna rip your cute little lungs out. (SCREAMING)... (GRUNTING) Pull. Almost. (EXPLOSION)... (SCREAMS) HELEN: No. Enola. ENOLA: No. Saint Joe. Hole in one. Helen. No. Enola. GREGOR: Helen. Hey. Hey. If I can't have Dry land, no one will. (HELEN SIGHING) HELEN: Oh, no. Quick. What are we gonna do? Tie this off. GREGOR: Hurry. Tie it. HELEN: Got it. (SCREAMS)... (SCREAMING) Get them up now. (GREGOR LAUGHING) Of course. Of course. The numbers. (LAUGHING) The numbers. They must be it. What? I was swimming. I saw. GREGOR: My friends. My friends, look. This map... This map, it bears a grid system with numbers the ancients used... to determine geographic location on the world. Just like the numbers and the symbols on Enola's back. First they would determine the angle of the sun using this, and that would tell them where they were located on the grid... and which direction they had to go. If I take a bearing from the sun... and reverse the coordinates on Enola's back, then Dry land is that way. (SEAGULL CAWING)... (SEAGULL CAWING)... (HELEN LAUGHING) It's fresh. All of this. It's fresh. (HELEN WHOOPING)... (ALL LAUGHING) I found something. (BIRDS CHIRPING) Maybe we should put them under the dirt. I think it was their way. They must have known they were dying. (HELEN LAUGHING)... (WINDING)... (MUSIC PLAYING) I'm home. Where's the Mariner? He was outside. Wait. Wait. L want to show you this. (BIRDS CHIRPING)... (HORSES NEIGHING)... (HORSES GALLOPING)... (BIRDS CHIRPING) First time in your life you got nothing to say? Enola, I have to go now. But you came back for me. I like you. Why are you leaving? I don't belong here. I belong out there. You belong here. It's too strange here. It doesn't move right. Helen said that it's only landsickness. We're all feeling it. It'll go away soon. It's more than that. (SNIFFLES) Well, goodbye, my friend. Oh, I have something for you. It's dirt. Don't trade it all in one place. Or do. It'll give you reason to come back for more. (GREGOR LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY) It's all I got, Drifter. It's enough. Is it that easy for you to just drift away? Never said it was easy. I don't understand. I don't understand. I mean, you brought us here. You belong here as much as anyone, maybe more. What do you think you're going to find? What are you looking for out there? Gregor once said there might be others like me somewhere. I have to know. Helen, if I find any others out there like you, I'll tell them about this place, and how one woman with hope and courage found it. I have something for you, something you'll need on your journey. I don't have much to barter with. It's no trade. It's a gift. No such thing in Waterworld. Well, then let this be the first. It's a name. It's from an old story about a great warrior returning from battle. He just set sail, and the water god cursed him, and for the next 10 years, he drifted on the seas. The warrior drifted on the seas, unable to find his way home, until finally the gods took pity on him, and they called up a warm wind that blew him home to his family, and he never left them again. His name was Ulysses. It's a good name. (PANTING)
