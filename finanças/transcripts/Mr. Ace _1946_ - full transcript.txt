"The story of a challenge to a man and to a woman." This concludes the debate on women in politics. And now ladies and gentlemen, if there are any questions do not hesitate. I am sure the contestants will be happy to answer. Mister Chairman. Mister Chairman. Alright. This one if for Congresswoman Chase. Mrs Chase. Your question please. Congresswoman Chase. If you were nominated for the governorship. Would you accept? I would not only accept. But if, or rather when I am elected. I would give this great state the kind of service it has so rarely had. But so richly deserves. Good, good, Mrs Wheeler. Thanks, Peter. Any time. Congratulation, Governor. I heard it over the radio. Not yet, Alma. We've a long way to go. Want a drink, Peter? No thanks. Excuse me. I want to go home and get some sleep like I've money in the bank. Yes. Get some rest, Peter. Because tomorrow morning .. Well, get ready. - Uhuh. Goodnight. Goodnight. And although I think the Committee of Ways and Means cannot do this .. Ouch. Cannot do this. I definitely hold no brief for .. Hello? Yes. I'll see if she's in. One moment please. Your husband. I think you'd better speak to him. He is rather excited. Excuse me, Kathy. Yes? Just a minute. I don't think so. Don't you think it's a little late for you to be telling me what to do? No I won't. No. I wouldn't advise it. I wish he were here. I could strangle him. Did you hear what he said to me? - I think what he says is unimportant. You do, eh? - Yes, I do. Kathy. 'Although I think the Committee of Ways and Means ..' Yes? Send him in. Peter. Hi. Did you see the afternoon papers? Better than the morning. How are you, governor? - I am being beaten to death. Oh? Well, you'll survive after you read these papers. How do you like the looks of that one? Very nice. Very nice. And now, Peter. Mr Eddie Ace and the Tomahawk Club. Hey, boss. Is this dame going to be governor? Now, Pencil. You know she's too pretty to be governor. Who does she think she is? Because we let her go to congress is no reason to think we let her do this. Something has got to be done. She's just front-page happy. She wants her picture in the paper. Don't take it so lightly, Mr Ace. They had a woman governor in Texas, didn't they? In Wyoming, didn't they? And since 1917 there were 29 women in congress. There are 9 now and .. One woman Senator in the 77th Congress. You're a big man around here, Toomey. What would you suggest? I suggest that we don't let her get started. The country is a little dizzy nowadays. Anything is liable to happen. Come now, Mr Toomey. You're building yourself a bonfire. You are awfully relaxed about it. Mrs Chase is just a bit too glamorous for me. And I don't like the look in her eye. Hmm. She has got pretty eyes at that. Let her keep them on the society pages. Stop worrying about it. Now woman has ever been governor. Of this state. Come on, Pencil. Mr Ace. Telegram, sir. Thanks, Tommy. Hey, son. Here you are. Write home to your mother. Well. 'Will you please come to dinner tonight at 8:30'. '411 Silver Park. Apartment 14A'. 'Margaret Wyndham Chase'. She's awfully quick on the draw. I am sorry, Mr Chase. But .. - Will you please step aside? What's the meaning of this? I think it's obvious. You own the paper. You ought to know what is printed in it. This is not going to happen. Do you have any objections? - Yes. You promised me an annulment .. When your term in congress was over. I've changed my mind. Why? Because you are an ideal husband. I cannot get along without you. You are really serious? - Yes. I know what I want and I'm going to get it. And no man, woman or child is going to stop me. I will. No you won't. The Pembroke Chases with all their immaculate traditions. Would rise gently from their graves to stop you. They wouldn't want the world to know about you and .. June Hadley and Wendy Wilson and Mary Thomas and all the other little .. There wouldn't have been any if you'd not made me look elsewhere. That's beside the point. You'll make a very impressive governor's husband, darling. Alma. For dinner tonight. Don't forget to put Professor Adams on my left. And Mr Ace on my right. Boss. What do you figure this female is looking for? The same thing any of them look for. A little more than is good for them. Yeah. You said it. When a gal from the top drawer. Invites a guy from the bottom drawer. He ain't looking to break even. Why, Pencil. You're a philosopher. There it is. See you later. Boss. Yes? I case you get in trouble, drop me a line. Professor Adams still thinks I'm in his classroom at the university. You'll do well to remember some of the things you learned there. Professor, I thought I was your prize student. You were. But you are not my prize graduate. And why not, Professor? Well, look at you. An attractive, desirable woman. And what function are you serving? Are you in love? No. Are you cleaning the house? No. Cooking the breakfast? No. Are you even having babies? No. You are in politics. Why? Perhaps it needs more of a feminine touch. And don't be coy. I don't object to women in politics. I object to you in politics. Government is a sacred trust. Not to be worn in one's hat like an adornment. Nor in one's hip pocket as a blackjack. And I want to get some air. Professor, I once read a book you wrote. I don't believe it. I read once in a while. The Racing Form. The funny papers. And your book. I think it was called 'American Votes'. Right? That is the title. You probably just found that out on the way up here. No. I read every word of it. It took me a long time but I read it. I am glad you did. It was directed at someone like you. Me? Fellows who make a racket out of politics. Professor, I should resent that but I don't. You're too smart to resent the truth. Well, as ill-mated a pair as I ever saw. Excuse me, Professor. Mr Ace and I have something to talk about. I quite understand. Well. What do you think of my friends? Very impressive. - They should be. They represent almost every important element in this community. You think so? Evidently, you don't. Did it ever occur to you that .. Your viewpoint may be a little limited. Perhaps the world is bigger than you've given yourself a chance to find out. There is a lot of good living to do. Interesting people to meet. Maybe. You also meet all kinds in my business. And you learn a lot. Take Professor Adams for instance. I admire Professor Adams more than anybody I know. But I'm afraid he is little too idealistic about a great many things. That's why I am glad we met. You are a practical man. You understand the complex business of winning elections. I am a practical woman. Who wants to be and intends to be the next governor of this state. We can admire idealism. But we cannot allow it to interfere with .. What is your proposition? With what you know. And what I have to offer. We would be a pretty hard combination to beat. I know what you'd get out of it. What would I get out of it? What do you want? I'll think it over. When can I expect an answer? Tomorrow night at dinner. At my place. I'll be there. Alright, boys. Break it up. Pencil. Come on. Do your stuff. Good evening. - Good evening. Pencil, this is congresswoman Chase. Pleased to meet you, ma'am. How do you do. May I? Thank you. Come in. I'd like you to meet some of my friends. Your friends? - Yes. Gentlemen. I'd like you to meet Congresswoman Margaret Wyndham Chase. How do you do. This is Max Wheldon. - How do you do. How do you do. His bid to fame is he's the only man in the world to ever hit a 7-horse poly. And the eighth horse ran second. Too bad. I could have given you the winner in the race. Then you do follow the turf, Mrs Chase? - Causally. Her husband owns the Green Leaves stables. Got anything going tomorrow? This is my good friend Mickey Whitehead. - How do you do. Mickey just built a new highway. - Yes, I know. Remember, you voted against it. If I had a moment alone with you .. I think I could prove to you that I am still right. This is Charlie and Dick Renfall. - How do you do. How do you do. Charlie has been in City Hall for the past thirty years. Really? And Dick doesn't work either. That's very witty, boss. Excuse me. - Never mind, boss. I got it. Would you like to hear the same thing again, Mrs Chase? No. Play some boogie-woogie. You got it. This is Mr Willow. - How do you do. Gentleman Gene Delmont. - How do you do. Mr Harrington. - How do you do. Mr Cahn. How do you do. - It's a pleasure. This is one of Pencil's specials. It certainly is special. That is good for you. All it has is some ice, a nag and a little gin. With apricot brandy. And two bottles of vodka. Gentlemen. Look, boys. Relax. Tom. Do you think your boy will win tomorrow night? Well, he's in great shape. Miss Chase. Would you like to win yourself a bet? On what? My fighter is going at The Garden. Who is he? - Willie Argo. He is fine. I've seen him. Who's he fighting? Jack Boyce. What are the odds? - My boy's the favorite. About 8-5. Do you think he'll win? - If he doesn't .. He'll have to fight me. Where can I make a bet? At your service, Mrs Chase. Alright. I would like to bet five hundred. On the favorite? No. I will take the odds. I think you're betting on the wrong boy. I never bet on favorites. Do you take bets on anything? - Yes, ma'am. Anything. Horses. Fights. Baseball. I even took bets on your last election. That's very interesting. How do you determine the odds? It's mostly mathematics. I have people around me who have a talent for finding things out. Now take Mr Ace for example. He's very seldom wrong about an election. And since he's my friend I make the price. Based to a great extent upon his judgement. And what would you say my chances were, Mr Ace? Well, you've got a lot of class. Your last race was fair. And your recent workouts are good. So all we have to find out is if you are really trying. Let us assume that I am. In that case, I'd have to give you an outside chance. Thank you. You see, there's more than one way to lose a race. Even when a good horse is trying. Goodnight, ma'am. - Goodnight, Pencil. I enjoyed the corned beef and cabbage. That's nothing, Mrs Chase. You should be here on Tuesday when we have Irish stew. Gentlemen, goodnight. Goodnight, Mrs Chase. How did you like my friends? I liked them very much. They are important people. - Really? Yes indeed. Well. You haven't given me your answer. That can wait. There's a little thing called 'living' going on. Remember? Music. Dancing. I don't generally go to nightclubs. I don't either. But I don't generally get this lucky. St Pierre Hotel. I like that song. So do I. You were watching me, weren't you. A lady can get run over with her eyes closed. Not a grown-up lady. Yes she can if she keeps her eyes closed. Can I buy you a drink? I'd rather dance. I'd rather buy you a drink. Yes, sir? Once champagne cocktail and a bourbon and water. You dance very well. Thank you. You do everything well, don't you. - I try. If it's worth trying for. I like that in a man. Nothing ventured, nothing lost. Down around my way you get slapped in the face a lot but you also .. You know .. you're very attractive. Not really. Just clever. Listen. By special request. Tired? Dance? Food? A drink? Well? I think we'd better be going. Waiter. Check. That's alright. Thanks. Ready? I think we could have done without that. Maybe you could. But I couldn't. What are you trying to prove, Mr Ace? If there's any woman in you. Is there? Plenty. Jon, will you please take Mr Ace home. Well. Are you going to support my nomination? No. You're not? Why? Because beautiful women don't belong in politics. Where do they belong? Where do you think? Goodnight. Goodnight. [ Door knocks ] Come in. I was worried about you. Are you alright? - Fine. I had a wonderful time. Did you convince Mr Ace? No. Not yet anyway. Did you find Mr Ace interesting? Very. Very. Very interesting. "A hat rack on which to hang all the ills that the body politic can suffer." "And not let it become a Halloween party for masquerades." "Let's embrace our democracy." "Let's remember where it came from and how far it can go." Professor Adams. Yes, Martha? Mr Ace to see you, sir. Oh. Well, show him in. Professor. Hello. I was just sitting here listening to my own voice. How did you like it? If you ever feel you've become important just listen to yourself sometime. A drink? No thanks. - Come. Let's sit down. I rather hesitated to ask you to come out. Why? You're a pretty busy man. Especially nowadays. Never too busy for something interesting. I understand from Margaret that you're not going to support her. No. Good. I thought you were her friend. I am. And that's why I am glad you turned her down. She is spoiled. Always got everything she wanted. It's about time she learned she can't have everything just by asking for it. Don't you think so? I can't say. I don't know enough about her. Well I do. And believe me. I love her as if she were my own daughter. I suppose that's why I put up with her. Ace. I want you to promise me. That you'll do everything you can to keep her from getting elected. I don't have to promise. That is my job. Good. Come on. Get down. It's a pity. With her brains and education she'd probably make a good governor .. If she used her heart too. Has she got one? Yes. I tell you there's a woman there. A fine, warm loving woman. And I hope some good man finds it out. Before she shrivels up into some bitter, lonesome old crone. What's the matter with her husband? I would not know. I am just a professor of political science. Sometimes I talk too much too. Cigarette? I don't deny my wealth. My father earned his fortune the hard way. My father earned his fortune the hard way. In the best American tradition of rags to riches. My having money gives you the people, one guarantee. I don't need to sell myself. I don't need to sell myself to the highest bidder. I don't mean .. Yes? Hello, Professor. No. I am just rehearsing a speech. I've got to do something about the people saying I'm too rich. Who? How amusing. No. No. I'm very pleased you talked about me. Very pleased. Oh? He said I wouldn't be governor? Professor. Will you be a darling and do something for me? Have a small dinner tomorrow night. Just Mr Ace and you and me. You are wonderful. And don't tell him I'm coming. I'll name a college after you when I'm elected. You don't have to wait, John. Good evening, Martha. Good evening, Professor. And Mr Ace. I was afraid I would be a little late but I see I am among the early ones. Not at all. We're all here now. Martini? - Yes please. Or don't you think a woman candidate for office should drink, Mr Ace? It's alright I guess if she doesn't do it in public. Not too much. The first lesson in practical politics. Your personal life. No matter how evil. Should never be permitted to endanger your public and vote-getting propriety. But, Professor. You didn't invite me here for Mr Ace to give me lessons in practical politics. I'm not sure Mr Ace could teach you anything about practical politics. Your health. You've a lot of books here, Professor. Are they all about political science? Not all, but most. Well, will any one of them tell you how to get the public out to the polls .. In a close election year? No. I don't think so. Then what good are they? Well. Once in a while you run into something rather interesting. For example there was a man named Rousseau. Who said that those that treat politics and morality apart .. Will never understand the one or the other. Do you have Morley? Isn't he the one who said that the proper memory of a politician .. Is one that knows what to remember. And what to forget. Some of our best politicians have never read anything but the racing form. How about you? I got a pretty good education just growing up. What made you become a politician? From where I was sitting it looked like a good business. And you still think that women don't belong in politics? That's right. Why? In your case, as I told you before .. You're too beautiful. She has got brains. A woman with a face like that shouldn't have brains. You don't think very much of women, do you? Me? I love them. Dinner is served. Good. I have suddenly developed a terrific appetite. [ Piano music ] Would you like some Tristan and Isolde? Heavens, no. How about Don Juan? Now you're being terribly romantic. I think I'd better start for home before you weave some sort of spell over me. It is only eleven o'clock. I know, But I still have some work to do tonight. Goodnight. I forgot. I've sent my car home. I'm spending the weekend at the cottage. It is only seven miles from here on the way to town. Would you mind very much dropping me off? I would be glad to. Thank you. Goodnight, Professor. It's been a delightful evening. Night, Margaret. - Goodnight, Professor. Goodnight, Mr Ace. Who was it who said politicians had to know what to remember, what to forget? Morley. Thanks for letting me drive. It is so much easier than giving lots of directions. You like to drive, don't you? Rain. We had best put the top up. - Push that button. It doesn't work. Push it again. Now race the engine. I guess you are right. The cottage isn't very far from here. Just a few minutes. We won't get so wet. Do you mind shaking up the fire? It will warm up and comfortable in a moment. Better take that jacket off. It's soaking wet. I'll get you something dry. Here you are. Put this on. Your husbands? - No. My father's. You make yourself comfortable. I'm going to change into something dry. Mix yourself a drink. It's on the table. Make one for me too. Is that your father's picture over the fireplace? Yes. You don't have to shout. I'm in the next room. A very rugged-looking man. A very rugged man. He never failed at anything he did. So I've heard. He always had his own way. No matter what. That's right. He climbed right over anybody. Or. He won them over to his side. Is something wrong? Yeah. What? You look like a little girl. Well, I am not exactly an old woman, you know. I know but .. We don't go in for fuss and feathers in this house. You like this house. I love it. My father used to come in here a great deal. I was practically brought up in it. And your mother? She died when I was twelve. You don't approve of him, do you? Why shouldn't I? I believe in getting what I want. So do I. A nice fire. Yeah. It's burning good. A shame to waste it. Isn't this about the time that most men make .. Pretty speeches? Stop talking. I want to look at you. Why? I said, stop talking. You never want to be in love, do you. Because if you were, you'd do anything for the woman. I know. My father was like that. He was ruthless and cruel. I know he loved mother and me. But he never showed it. That was very unfortunate. For him. Thanks. Well. I guess I'd better be going. Yes. I suppose so. If it isn't raining too hard. Yes. It's raining too hard. I think you can fix yourself up on the couch. I'll manage. Goodnight. Goodnight. You have an appointment. Tuesday. 3 o'clock. Polish Alliance Hall. Did you hear that, Margaret? - Yes. You wanted me to remind you to write to Tom Wallace. Yes. We'll get to that in time. Hello Margaret. Hello Peter. Did you talk to marketing? - Yes. Six more broadcasts. Margaret, how'd you make out with Ace? Without that Tomahawk crowd we've no chance. Ace is the boss. You'd better get to work on him. Peter. What do you know about Mr Toomey that I don't know? Toomey? No. Ace is the man. He cracks the whip. Mr Toomey may be easier to do business with. What do you mean? Well. If there was a split in the Tomahawk crowd. That would lead to considerable confusion. Am I right, Peter? Are you kidding? And we might very easily find ourselves in control of the convention. A very good chance. Let's have a talk with Mr Toomey. Eddie Ace and I don't exactly see eye-to-eye on a great many things. But I think we can safely say that next to him .. I'm the most important man in the organisation. I only tell you these things so you know you're dealing with a responsible party. We are convinced with your references. But we're more concerned with whether or not you can do it. I think I can line up several of the boys. Enough to get the convention? Yes. I think so. With the right kind of .. Pressure. And if things were taken care of afterwards. What do you mean by .. 'Things'? Shall we say, we will play ball afterwards. New appointments. Maybe some favors. One or two .. But I don't think we have to go into detail, do we. Especially since we all trust each other. We do not have to go into details. Of course you realize that all of this must be kept extremely quiet. Just a little surprise we'll spring when the convention is in session. If Ace should find out I could not guarantee the results. I can assure you we'll keep very quiet. [ Door knocks ] Yes? Hey, boss. We got a visitor. Who is it? Pembroke Chase the 3rd. Oh. Make him very comfortable. Mr Ace will be with you in a minute. Thank you. Mr Chase. How do you do. Coffee? - No thank you. What can I do for you? I have come to offer you a bribe. That will be my first this morning. What for? - It's about my wife. How much? - Fifty thousand. That isn't very much for an important job like the governorship. I don't want her to be governor. I want her out of politics. I'll give you fifty thousand not to support her. Or better yet. I'll double any amount she has offered you. You must want her at home awfully bad. On the contrary. I want her out of my life. Is it a deal? Save your money. She won't be governor. A call for Mr Toomey. A call for Mr Toomey. A call for Mr Toomey. 5th floor. Hurry up, will you. Going up? - Going up. Thank you. I said right away. Well? They're lining up for the final vote. It ain't good, boss. Someone left the door open and I don't like it. Did you see Toomey? Nope. He has been playing the duck. Get his room. He doesn't duck on me. Go ahead. Call him. Okay. [ Telephone ] Answer it. It won't bite you. Hello? Yes. Yes. Okay. Alright. Let's have it. She's in, boss. She is nominated. She did, eh? I thought you told me she wasn't going to get it. I was wrong. Hey, boss. What you going to do? How does it feel, Congresswoman? I'm really quite breathless. Hello, you beautiful dark horse. Let's have a drink. Oh, brother. Congratulations, Peter. Thanks, Alma. Have a drink. Boys. I would like to propose a toast to our next .. What do you think would happen if .. - Excuse me please. Mr Ace, please. "Sorry. He's checked out." Checked out? Give me the desk please. Yes? Who? He is checking out right now. Mr Ace. A call for you. Hello? Leaving? Without even congratulating me? I just congratulated Toomey. Margaret. Please. Where are the bags? - The boys got them. I'll be right with you. I didn't think you'd be a sore loser. I don't like being crossed. Especially when it's doubled. All is fair in politics. Remember. You said that. Your husband insists upon seeing you. Impossible. Not today. I think you had better see him. Alright. Show him in. You may go in. - Thank you. Good afternoon, darling. Never mind the amenities. May I say you look charming. A little tired maybe, but .. I don't like you in this mood. What is on your mind? - Nothing of importance. Except that I'm going to divorce you. You've been drinking. No, sweetheart. Not this time. And I'm naming Eddie Ace as co-respondent. Don't be ridiculous. If you don't mind, I'm very busy. In fact I'm indebted to Mr Ace. He sent for me. What for? He's going to swear an affidavit .. That you and he spent the night together at your country place. Sorry. Try again. It just so happens that Mr Ace and I spent a perfectly innocent evening .. That isn't what he claims. And on the basis of it. I am going to sue you for divorce. I'm going to file suit, my dear. Right in the middle of your campaign. Just where it hurts the most. And I trust we'll remain good friends. Madame ex-governor. Even if he can't make it stick, what difference does it make? There's just enough truth in it to ruin you. How could you allow yourself to do such a darned fool thing? Will you stop saying that? We're not playing penny ante. Have you nothing better to offer than criticism? What will I do, pin a medal on her or give her a demerit? I knocked my brains out. Begged, plundered, blackmailed. Ah .. Why don't you see Mr Ace? He would like that. And the stakes are very high. Sacrifices are generally in order. Sorry. We're fresh out of sacrifices today. You are foolish, my dear. To get so close .. And to then let the opportunity slip through your fingers. Come on. Say it. You didn't ask me here just to sit and look at me. Well I .. I don't .. Quite know how to begin. That's a new one for you, isn't it? I seem to be discovering new ones every day. I've been doing that all my life. Did you ever hear of good sportsmanship? What has that got to do with politics? It was a pretty cheap trick, Eddie. Using my husband against me. Remember? All is fair in politics. I thought so once. I asked the professor to invite you to dinner. I planned that you would come to the cottage. It was a scheme to get you to support me. Your father told me that just in time. My father? He was watching us from over the fireplace. I wonder what he thought when .. A woman can be clever and shrewd. She can think brains more important than heart as she feels above other things. But some little thing may happen. An ash may grow too long on a cigarette. A man may look too long in her eye. Suddenly everything collapses. She is afraid. Eddie. I don't want you against me. I need your help. You'll try anything, won't you. Front door. Back door. The upstairs window if she can't get in any other way. I'm trying to make you understand. - Look. You said it and I said it. All is fair in politics. You're making the wrong kind of a speech for a woman wanting to become governor. You're promising too much. You want to be careful about that. Never promise the voters more than they'll believe. And on your record I wouldn't believe you if you promised to become a woman. I don't believe it. It can't be true. I've seen everything in my life and this can't .. A telegram. Margaret. Tell me this is not true. It's true. What do you mean: 'not running'? You can't wind up the whole world just on account of that divorce business. We'll buy Eddie Ace out. Better yet, I get Pembroke to withdraw. I'll talk to him. He listens to me. We went to school together. That has nothing to do with it. - Alright. Then please enlighten this poor pup of a brain on why you've withdrawn. She says she's not fit to run for office. Any office. - Ha. Who is? She says she's tired of being Margaret Wyndham Chase. Well, I am sorry. Who does she want to be? Myself. If there's any of myself left. Darling this is rip-roaring, double-barrelled insanity. People don't say they're not going to run after they've been nominated. Oh. Look, Margaret. I refuse to believe you'd do anything so idiotic. You're upset. That's bound to happen. Now, why don't you take a nice big pill and get some sleep? You'll feel better. I'll come back tonight and see how you are. Margaret. Yes? Please listen carefully to me. This is the big moment we have been waiting for and working for. It isn't the end. It's the beginning. Naturally, you'll have moments where it all seems futile. But we mustn't permit them to alter our plans or purpose. That is weakness. I'm not going to run for governor. I've also written you a check for a year's salary. I won't be needing your services any longer. "In the most startling confession every made by a public figure." "The beautiful socialite, Congresswoman Margaret Wyndham Chase." "In resigning from the contest for governor." "Scored dishonesty in politics and the travesty on democracy which permits .." "Quote:" "Men and women like myself with too much money and too little conscience." "To buy seats in government." "When asked to explain her change of heart, Congresswoman Chase replied .." "No comment." "The explosion of this news .." I never figured her for a confession. No, sir. Must have an angle. You mean you're going to divorce me of your own free will? I am flying to Reno. It will be the simplest. There will be less publicity. And all this about resigning is on the level? Margaret. Is there anything I can do? No thank you. Hey boss, I just came from the club and everything is humming down there. And all the fellahs were asking me if .. Do I dare .. Hope you could learn to care? Or will this moment wear .. Off in a day? Remember. Well, I'm glad you came over. We can lift a drink to Margaret's withdrawal. I am delighted. Absolutely and thoroughly and completely delighted. Have you seen her? - No I haven't. I telephoned her several times but she's either left town or gone into seclusion. What is your mind, Ace? The campaign. You have nothing to worry about now. Your man can't lose. Are you satisfied with our man? Me? Of course not. He's a pompous fool and he will do just as he's told. The public has struck again, huh? He's your man. You ought to know. Look, Professor. I came here to make a deal. A deal with me? Did it occur to you there's been no opposition organisation in this state? Of course. But what's that to do with me? With you heading an independent party. I could give you organisation and money. What has gotten into you? Maybe I am fed up or .. I've got religion too. Well. What do you say? And I suppose you would provide the candidate? Yes. I thought so. You're shrewd, Ace. You know, the day of the political machine is almost over. You want to start a new party. You'll get the reform elements organised and you think I'm stupid enough to help. I may be a foolish old bookworm. But I have sense enough to know when I'm being used for bait. Finished? - No. And you ought to be ashamed of yourself. Taking advantage of what might have been a lasting friendship. Finished now? - For good. Okay. I said I'd give you money and organisation, didn't I? That's where the strings come in. - There's no strings. I want that candidate elected. And the only way it can be done is to rid the state of political machines. And if she does that .. She'll get out enough votes to .. - She? Who is 'she'? Margaret. Ace. If you're sincere, you're volunteering to commit political suicide. And if you are not. You must expect some kind of payoff. Yeah. I'm figuring on a payoff. Well, what is it? A good long rest and a chance to go to heaven. I don't understand you. Maybe if I did. I'd be able to trust you. And I don't trust you. You think a lot of that dog, don't you? We think a lot of each other. I guess he'd do anything for you, wouldn't he? Anything he could. Especially if you were in trouble. Ace. You are in love. - Skip it, Professor. You'll try anything, won't you? Front door. Back door. The upstairs window if you can't get in any other way. You said it and I said it. All is fair in politics. You're making the wrong kind of a speech for a woman wanting to become governor. You're promising too much. You want to be careful about that. Never promise the public more than they'll believe. And on your record I wouldn't believe you if you promised to become a woman. [ Door knocks ] Professor. - Hello Margaret. Well. Aren't you going to ask me in? Huh? It's late. I've spent hours trying to find you. Professor, I really don't .. - Better not send me away, lady. I'm selling a sure cure for practically everything that's troubling you. It is concocted of work and more work. I don't want to work. I don't want anything. I don't want to be bothered. The trouble with people like me is we waste our lives with wishful thinking. Margaret. I have organised a new political party. Dedicated to clean politics and honest government. Have you gone mad? Politics is not for you. It's full of deceits and tricks. You cannot beat the organisations. I've got an organisation of my own now. I've run up and down this state knocking on doors, blowing horns. I've talked to workers, framers, bankers students. I've talked to everybody. I've even talked to politicians. Darling, you'll only break your heart. - Nonsense. The whole thing is organised and ready. I've even lined up state-wide support for my candidate. She can't lose. She? Of course. You. You're my candidate. Now I know you're mad. No I'm not. Just a while ago you did everything you could to keep me out of politics. Your motives are wrong. Your impulses are unhealthy. I know. You are right. That's why I resigned. That is why I am here. That's why I want you to leave me alone. But Margaret. - Stop it, Professor. Stop. I won't do it. It's no use. I don't want to try anymore. I don't even want to hope anymore. And you really haven't got much to say about it anymore. By your own statement. When you gave up the race. You made the people believe that you would really fight to win this time. To fight against corrupt machine politics in this state. Is that your platform? Yes. And it is rightly built. And when we've won .. We'll use the planks to make a coffin for the Tomahawk Club. And Eddie Ace? Naturally. Leave me alone. Why .. you have just confused me. I don't know what to do. Leave me alone. Cry. Go ahead. Cry a little. And cry some more. And when you've finished. We'll start singing Hallelujah. And I promise you. I will erase every disreputable political organisation from this state. I will harass them and destroy them. And I will start with that noble and enlightening organisation .. The Tomahawk Club. And I will finish with its leader. The honorable Mr Eddie Ace. The way I look at it. This woman has pulled one of the smartest tricks so far. She bows out on account of she can't stand dirty politics. And then she comes back in to fight them. What a build-up. I don't get it. - That's because you're a man. To a woman it makes sense. She'll have everyone in the state voting for her. I'd better check with all the district leaders to ensure they know what to do. The last time you checked, Toomey, we lost the nomination. Look, chief. I've learned my lesson. I know where I stand and I keep my feet right in the middle of it. And you're keeping your nose out of the districts. I'm handling this myself from now on, gentlemen. I'll make all the necessary contacts. Hello. Hello. I heard your speech last night. You're now quite a public speaker. Thank you. Are you going to blast me again tonight? Perhaps. What do you think of your chances? They say it will be close. You know, you had me fooled for a while. I thought you were just a frontrunner. Well, if I don't see you again, good luck. Eddie. I am. I am sorry I .. - It's kinda silly, isn't it? All is fair in politics. Gilbert 478. Chase 812. Roberts 172. Gilbert 751. Chase 802. Roberts 209. Good, good. Where's Tommy? - I don't know. Get him right away. What time is it? 10:30. Where's the totals? - Right here. Excuse me. Peter. How's it going? Wait until you get a load of these figures. Excuse me. Watch this. I don't like it. I don't like it a bit. They're piling up votes in districts we've not lost in 30 years. It seems some of our boys are slipping. - Yes. Or being bought off. You don't think this professor .. - Professors don't have any money. Well, somebody is backing her. Somebody with money and know-how. It's too easy. Far too regular. Hey, Mack. Yeah? Do your boys know Professor Adams? - Yeah. Send a couple of them over to Chase's headquarters and .. Tell the professor Mr Ace would like to see him. Okay. And Mack. - Yeah? If the Prof doesn't want to come when asked, make sure he comes anyway. I get it. I beg your pardon, Professor. - Yes? How are you? Mr Ace wants to see you? Ace? - Uhuh. Mister Ace? You tell Mr Ace that I'll call tomorrow. I have to .. Mr Ace wants to see you right now. This is ridiculous. - Right now, Professor. Right now. - Most ridiculous thing I ever heard. Now really, Toomey. This is a little silly. People don't do this sort of thing now. - Yeah. I know. It used to be more fun in the old days. Well, give me the dope quickly and then you can go. Dope? - Yeah. Who is backing you in this deal? Backing me? Put up the money. Organised the districts. Got out the voters. Who did all that? Quite a large group of people. Decided the time had come to rid the community of .. Get off the platform, Adams. You don't know anything about politics. This deal wasn't swung by an amateur. It was done by a professional, see. One of the best. What is he doing here? We invited him. Get him out. Not until I find out from him who made the districts swing to the Chase woman. What's so bad about that? You tried it once, didn't you? That was yesterday's ballgame. And I haven't forgotten the score. Professor, you can go. You double-crossed us, Ace. Toomey. I told you before I'll handle this my own way. Why you .. Professor. Margaret. We did it. We did it, Margaret. We did it. We did it, pal. Yes. We did it alright. Governor. Hot coffee. - Thank you. Cream, sugar? Tired, darling? Huh? Oh. No. What is the matter, darling? You're being terribly vague. I'm sorry. You don't seem the least bit happy. I'm not sure I am. You yourself wanted me to run. Yes. I know. But what? Margaret. The whole thing was Ace's idea. Ace's idea? Yes. You must be really tired. You cannot mean what you just said. He said he could get you elected if I could get you to run. That doesn't make sense. He elected you, Margaret. It doesn't make sense. Why, you foolish old man. Don't you see what you've done? He'll want to run me now. He'll tell me what I can do, what I can't do. As he'll always be able to threaten me. I don't think so. Why didn't you stay with your books? I won't let him run me. I'll fight him. We were tricked and so have the voters. You're wrong, Margaret. For two reasons. One I'm sure of. He told me that if you could get religion, he could too. And the other? [ Buzzer ] I'll get it. What are you doing here? What do you want? It's time to count the chips. I suppose the professor has already shown his hand. Right, Professor? Yes he did. And it was aces all over. See, I added a little bit .. - That's okay. I figured on it. I am sensitive that way. I'd like to have a little private talk with the governor, if you don't mind. What about? Certain arrangements. So you see what you've done? How can I have let this happen? - Take it easy. Remember. No matter what happens .. I'm entitled to my share of the blame. You certainly didn't waste much time, did you. The returns are hardly in and already you've .. Already what? Don't you know that I'm going to prosecute you? How dare you talk about 'arrangements', 'counting chips'. I don't take orders from you. I give orders. That's right. But there's one order you will take from me, Margaret. What's that? I want you to be the best governor you know how. Do you mean that? Yes. You know what that means, don't you? I figure I'll be out of circulation for a while. And then? That's up to you. Eddie. Eddie. Don't go yet. Is that an order? That's the first time I've ever kissed a governor. ..t-g..
