SEVEN WOMEN FOR SATAN Sorry. I was miles away. Have a good weekend. See you on Monday. And you... Could you give me a lift, please? - I'm going through Versailles. - Great. - I'm moving on tomorrow. - Where are you headed? French Riviera. Italy. Turkey, maybe. You don't know? I'm alone. If you like, you can stay at my place tonight. I'll be back on the road tomorrow. Fine. I just bought an old chateau in the center of France. My butler's there now so tonight we'll be alone. Is that all right? Of course. Here we are. You live alone? Mostly. A good book - a warm fire. It's not so bad. More champagne? It'll help you sleep. Or would you rather that I use your body like a crystal cup. Ready? Let's go. Shall we stop? Mm. Good idea. - Fancy a walk? - Yes, I'd like that. - Ever been in love? - Yes. It was painful. So you ran away? I don't know. - Can we rest here? - If you want. You've a beautiful face. Made to express tenderness. Passion... And suffering too... Yes... That's what I want. No. No. No... No, don't worry. Don't worry. I just wanted to feel your life run through my fingers. Such soft skin. I want to go back to the car! I want to go! Go away. Leave me alone! Leave me alone! Go away. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I must have been crazy. I didn't want to hurt you. You're safe now. Let me hold you. Relax. Don't cry anymore. Shut up! You hear me? I'm sick of your moods! Stephane, Stephane! Stephane, I'm sorry. I lost my head! I'll buy you furs! I'll give you everything! I won't ask you anything, you hear me? Nothing! I'll give you anything you want. Clothes, jewels, furs... I won't ask you anything. I won't touch you anymore. I just want your forgiveness. It's your forgiveness I want. Stephane! Stephane! Stephane! Stephane... you're all broken. A rag doll. You're only a rag doll. And I thought you were a woman. I believed it for a second and it hurt me. Hurt me so much. But you're only a broken doll. I'll be late. Good evening, sir. - Good evening, Karl. - A pleasant journey, sir? Yes, thank you. Jeanne, take the bags. No, I'll take that one. Thank you, Karl. Here in our forest, you can relax. Life is transitory... What's that, Karl? Forgive me, Count. I was musing. About what? The fragility of human existence. It matters not, Karl. It's all relative. Relative to what, sir? To its usefulness, of course. In a kingdom only a prince's life matters. You're so right, sir. Father, at last the end of my work is in sight. And I'm proud of it. For years I wandered America and Europe looking for him. He has followed my advice and made a fortune. I've been able to guide him along the path that you chose. Karl, my son. Help me now escape the torments of life after death. Let me live through you. I devoted my life to my master, the Count Zaroff and became his accomplice. Yes, my fate became linked with his infernal destiny. My master thought he had the right of life and death over other human beings. My spirit cannot rest until you rekindle in his descendant the taste for torture of this accursed family. You have my oath. Here, on this lonely estate... his long suppressed taste for cruelty shall at last be freed. Some vodka. You foresee my every whim, Karl and fulfil them. Like those shadows, Count, that magnify our slightest gestures. You're my rock. Our shadows disappear with life itself, Count Zaroff. Poor girl. She knows not of his cruel lusts. And the demands he will make of her. No thank you, Karl. This is Jeanne. She is ready for your pleasure. Shall I send her to your room? Not tonight. I'm tired. Maybe tomorrow. I need to rest. Ingmar. Ingmar, Ingmar. Ingmar. Come. - Who are you? - Anne de Boisryvault. What are you doing here? Looking for someone. What are you afraid of? Death... - It was an accident. - You're lying. Remember... It was a stormy night. A ball at the castle... Look... My love... You're crazy. This is madness. Madness is to let you take another in your arms. But your husband? A jealous husband is powerless against a woman in love. But against us? Does it matter? We have this waltz just for us. Perhaps you would prefer a portrait of someone you know. I can easily have one sent from Paris. No. No, thank you. The new secretary called. She can't come until 8. The office will be shut by then and the doorman gone. Right. Wait. I'll be working late tonight. So I'll be here. I'll see her. You have references? I just moved to Paris. I took a secretarial course by post, but I have no references. I live alone and I need the work. If you're free this weekend you can leave on Friday afternoon with my chauffeur. I just bought a large estate in the country which needs restoration I need to do an inventory. That can be your trial. All right? Come in, miss. - Shall I take dictation before dinner? - No. This evening let's relax. We'll work tomorrow. Please sit down. No... over there. Have a good trip? Yes, thank you. Offer the young lady some champagne. I've already prepared her glass, sir. Thank you. The young lady does not like her champagne? No - it's nice. I adore evening when, from the forest glade, our souls float away... As does our conscience. Then our newly liberated instincts are set free. Seized by the profound vibrations that spread through our bodies. If you wish to dress for dinner all you need is in your room. Master, may I suggest you take your seat? The show is beginning and I think you will not be unmoved by the sight. Thank you, Karl. Surrender to the magic of the mirror. It reveals the marvellous duality of body and soul. Come closer and be entrapped, graceful skylark. You are not reflected in the mirror but in my look. It's looking itself that matters, not what we look at. It captures you and recreates a different you to satisfy your most secret wishes. Seduce yourself. No one else can guide your pleasure as expertly as you. Boris! Boris! Fear is a bad advisor. Get dressed. You'll be late for dinner. Please... Don't leave me like this. It would be rather cruel. Ingmar will calm her! Go, Ingmar, go! She's all yours. No! No! No! No! Our car's broken down a few miles from here. Can you put us up tonight? I'm sorry, but the master's away. Please... Who is it, Karl? Their car's broken down, Count Zaroff. I don't think we can help. Yes. They must stay here tonight. Very well, sir. Come in. Allow me. Thank you. Dinner will soon be served. I'll show you your room. - Oh Francis, I'm so happy! - It doesn't take much... A breakdown, walking miles through the woods... Lucky we saw the lights in this secluded place, though. Let's wait and see. Don't be such a miseryguts. It'll be fun to spend the night in a real castle! That butler didn't seem exactly pleased to see us. He's a bit stuffy... But I love this kind of thing. Get dressed. We musn't keep them waiting. Francis! What's up? There's a woman's body outside the window! A woman's body? Don't be silly. Get dressed. Please come and look... Look! She's gone! Is this some kind of dumb joke? Francis, there's a man carrying the body away! Come and look, please. Look. They've gone. Muriel, if you do this once more... I'll open the window... and there really will be a body down there. And you'll be the only one not to see it. Why? I don't have time to explain. - Francis! Now there's a man! - Carrying a body? I know. - Yes, he's carrying a body... - Stop playing about. Come on, let's go. Or I go alone. Come on. It's a wild part of the country. Very lonely. We'd been walking for hours before we found your castle. We were completely lost. I find lonely places very restful. Thanks for giving up your evening. Don't you get lonely out here? Not at all. Suffering is caused by people awakening feelings best left buried in our souls. Muriel is over sensitive. She imagines the most extraordinary things. Earlier this evening, impressed by your castle she saw a body through the bedroom window. Francis, don't make fun of me! Nobody here would do that. In a way you were right. The past and present are more closely linked than we imagine. If you're at all psychic a place with such a violent past might easily affect you. See! That's what I said. This evening, as we stood outside, I heard the most awful cry. It was a bird. I saw it fly off. Perhaps it was the cry of an innocent victim in the torture chamber downstairs. Where there are still some instruments. A torture chamber? Yes, young lady. And very well preserved. Francis, they're asleep. Let's have a look at the torture chamber. What on earth for? You really are depraved. Now we're here, it'd be a shame not to have seen it. I've had enough excitement. Now come to bed. Are you asleep? Francis? What are you looking for, Miss? There's a body in there! What's wrong? I think I frightened your fiancee. I didn't realise she was so sensitive. Come to bed now. - You'll be all right in the morning. - Francis, it's true. I saw a body. - You're being silly. - It's true! Your friend is upset. The best way to dispel fear is to explore it. Karl! Bring the torches. Excuse me, my dear. Be careful, the steps are slippery. Take care. Thank you, Karl. Let's reassure this young girl. Let's see what horrified her. Come on. Here we are... Where was the body? On the table. There's nothing there. Not a trace. She was on the table. Her head covered in blood. Your imagination again. I do apologise... No problem... After all, you wanted to visit the chamber. I must say, it's well stocked. Very impressive. What's that one? A double butcher's fork. On which a fat man was hung. His entrails slowly dripped out, leading to agony. Each victim was branded with a hot iron. Indicating the degree of torture they were to suffer. See. And what's that one for? That, dear lady, is for breaking your back. Legs fixed to the ground, arms stretched high. A few hours of that... your spinal column snaps like a dry twig. Bringing about a terrible paralysis. And that one? The iron mask is fixed to the jaw... the tongue pulled out without harming the throat. So you can't choke to death. Now here's something... The copper hammer separates the joints... and breaks your bones. The pain is unbearable. Like a modern sculpture. Designed to make you blind... by drawing out the optic nerve. The pain is so bad... you will be driven insane. You're quite an expert. What's this for? To punish unfaithful wives. They called it 'the lovers's bed'. A pretty name for an instrument of torture. How did it work? The adulterers were strapped onto it. Can we try it? If you want to... Karl, fasten the anklets. Not very comfortable. The man would have been covered by his partner. Come on Muriel, come to bed... What a charming offer. May I? I can see the amount you suffer depends on your partner's weight... Maybe they put itching powder on them, too. No, they were simply bound together... forever. How fantastic! How? By pulling a lever. - Want to try? - Yes!! Karl... What happens now? Just be patient, young lady. You must be quite annoyed, now. With your hands tied. Yes. Because I can't slap you. I don't think they'll forget this in a hurry. - Goodnight, Karl. - Goodnight, sir. - Unlock them now. - Right away, sir. Where are they? Don't worry. They're just playing a joke. They'll be back. I can't stand the noise of that thing. It sounds like a drawbridge. My wrists and my ankles are starting to hurt. Calm down. Be patient. Francis! You asleep? I can't stand it anymore. Be brave. They'll be back. Just don't get scared. That's what they want. Francis, what if they're crazy and this is for real? Help! Good morning, sir. Good morning, Karl. Did you sleep well, sir? Thank you, Karl. How are our guests? They left at dawn, sir. Father, we are approaching our goal. One cannot fight one's own nature. The love of a dead woman is powerless against the force of life itself. Mister? Mr Zaroff? Mr Zaroff? What is it? A young woman called several times. She's waiting for you. - Who? - Anne de Boisryvault. Anne, it's you at last. Anne, my love. My name is Jeanne. Anne... Anne... Boris... Boris... Anne! Boris! Boris. Come. Come! Boris... Come! Come! Boris, come! Don't leave me! Come... Come! It's you and me forever! Anne! Anne! Anne... Anne! Anne! Anne! Anne! Anne. Anne, my love. No! No! FOR SALE Father, please forgive me. I did everything I could... but she was stronger than me. And now it's over. I can start to live again. THE END
