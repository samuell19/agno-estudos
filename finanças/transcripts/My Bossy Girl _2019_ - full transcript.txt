Lee Elijah Ji Il Joo Heo Jeong Min Kim Ki Doo Lee Tae Geom Ryu Hye Rin Jang Hyejin Kim Min Gyu Lee Jini Kim Hui Seon What is that? Jeez. Put it down. I'm in the middle of practicing. Why have you opened a bike repair booth? You could've opened a robot or drone booth or something. 60% of guys from engineering departments tend to meet girls at volunteer clubs. That's right. That's called volunteering. Girls like men who sacrifice themselves and volunteer. Once you volunteer, you get to have a girlfriend. Then how come you didn't sign up for a volunteer club? Because no one accepts us. Why not? Han Hwi So, Gil Yong Tae, Lee Chang Gil! You haven't been in a relationship for 9888 days. Hey, don't worry. You'll get a girlfriend when you volunteer. Congratulations. Hey, don't worry. You'll get a girlfriend when you volunteer. Hey, don't worry. You'll get a girlfriend when you volunteer. I did the math. Bring it on. No. Come on. Nope. You bring it on. Excuse me? Hey, get the hell out of here. What do you think you're doing? Stay the hell away from me. Get the hell out of here. Are you serious? Bike Repair Volunteer Experience Archery Excuse me. You're a professional archer, aren't you? Have you ever seen an archer in a wheelchair? Either you used to be one or you used to do this as a hobby, I'm sure. So what? I haven't seen a sign saying professionals aren't allowed. See? I told you, you were a professional. I knew I saw you on TV. Really? I thought she looked familiar. See? We all saw you. So? My disabled friend shouldn't be doing this. Disabled friend? That's a friend. I'm not your friend. Just call me handicapped. Next, there will be a handicapped archers' exhibition match. Get the team ready. There's no time. Yeah, she is in the bathroom now. Where is Hye Jin? Huh? We don't have time. Well, maybe she's being sentimental again and feeling bad for herself in a corner somewhere? Huh? You're trying to protect her again. We're talking about Hye Jin, the emotionless robot. I know she's not being emotional right now. I'm going to lose my temper. Yeong Cheol, you should go look for her. Me? Where? Well, let's see. You know, a pub or something. Go search for her thoroughly. I mean, this is just an exhibition match. There's no way she's drinking the morning before a match. I don't think she's drinking. Are you guys kidding me? You can't do this to me. A deal is a deal. Give it to me. No, we can't. This is the most expensive one. I don't care. Just give it to me. How about a shoulder throw? Why is she so strong? Oh!! Oh!! Come on, let's go fight! This button isn't working. Dude, that's a skill, too. Here I come. Three, two, one! Bring it on. Let's run away. Hooray!! Statistics never lie. Stay here. Call me when girls get here. How about pajeon and rice wine? No, I want rice wine and pajeon. Good idea. Watch out. Timing and subtitles brought to you by ‚ù§Ô∏èMy Bossy Girlü§ñ Team @ Viki Are you all right? I'm fine. This happens a lot. What are you doing? Looks like this controller is broken. Let me hold this tight for you. Can you fix this? Yeah, I can fix it. I've got the tools here. Well, would you get up for a second? Pardon? I'm sorry. How did you do it? You're not a professional repairman or anything. I'm majoring in mechanics. This is so awesome. How much do I owe you? This is a free volunteer booth. You don't have to pay anything. You can just go. I don't like to owe anyone. Is it okay if I buy you some coffee? You can accept coffee, right? You usually drink coffee after a meal. I haven't eaten yet. Drinking coffee before having a meal could give me heartburn... Is that your way of saying, I should buy you a meal? N-No... That's not what I meant. Do you know any good places to eat? I don't want to go to a cafeteria. Let's eat something really good. I know a place. Ok, then. Shall we go? It's over there. A pork cutlet restaurant. Even thinking about that place makes me smile. Is there any other way to get there? No, there isn't. If that's the case, you should go eat alone. I can't go up. That place is really good though. Look, do you want to give me a piggy bag? It's that, or we should go somewhere else. Do you know the origin of the pork cutlet? No, what is it? I heard that Japan was affected by American soldiers during the Second World War. So, the Japanese started eating lots of meat. It was supposed to be beef cutlet, but they used pork instead. Is he a trivia nerd or what? Hello, how are you? Hello. Hi, Ha Mi. The usual? Yes... No. Hye Jin has never been here before, so, she might want to see the menu. I... Nah, just eat what you always eat. 2 sirloin cutlets. Well, excuse me? The food better be good or I'll lose my temper. Wow, this is super good. The batter is crispy enough. Look, I'm already out of this sauce. That's because of Maillard Reaction. Proteins are cooked by heat, which causes a chemical reaction... Just eat. I fried two more because I didn't want to waste the oil. Enjoy. Dad! Oh my god. This is dope. You're great. I'm glad you took me here. People's memories could change, but not their tastes... My mom told me that. Don't say that to other people unless you want to look like a mama's boy. Okay... Shall we leave? Thank you for the meal, chef. Ehem! Ah, right! I'm so sorry. Hop up! Uh? Hang on. If you tie them twice, like this, your laces won't come untied so easily. I usually don't care about that. Here, hop up. It's not here. Wait a minute. Where's my wheelchair? I can't believe he gave you his student card. Yeah, he's something. Where have you been, eaving this booth empty? What is that teddy bear thing over there? It was gone when we came back after eating. What's gone? The electric wheelchair. What is he talking about? I feel like he's an AI or something when he talks like that. An AI with a beta version that failed the Turing Test. What's the Turing Test? Who said that? The Turing Test is a test to tell how closely to human communication computers can get. It turns out Hwi So is a human Turing Test. By the way, where's my honey? He's right next to me. Huh? Where did he go? My lovely honey, where could my honey be? There he is! Why am I your honey? What do you mean? Because we like each other. I'm always asking you this, but why does someone like you have a crush on me? You're pretty and hot. My brain. I'm not smart. I want our baby to be pretty, have a good figure, and be smart. Gosh, she's terrifying. I think she's talking about dominant inheritance, your appearance from plastic surgeries is not inherited. Wait, you had plastic surgery on your face? Are you kidding me? Let's get out of here, now. I've got to show off to my model friends that I have a boyfriend who has a doctor's degree. No, I'm not going. Am I some kind of a toy that you can play with and throw away whenever you want to? Then is it okay to cancel the blind date for your friend and my friend? Your friend didn't seem like a pushover. Why are you still standing here? Let's go. How long has she been there? What? Jeez, you scared me. How long have you been here? From the beginning. I can't believe you didn't know she was here. They went out to eat lunch without you again? Why are you following guys like them? I came here earlier than them today. Of course you did. I'll be right back. He can't come back quickly. We're renting a club and partying all night long tonight. Bye. You're following Yong Tae, too. What? $2,000? That's too expensive. That's too much for just a wheelchair with an electric motor and a joystick. Dude, of course it's expensive. Are you only going to charge the material cost when you make and sell a machine? You've got to think about the costs for engineering, researching, marketing, profits from production, and sales. Chang Gil, do you have some money? Of course not. It just passed me by, like the wind yesterday. Shoot, what am I going to do? You've got to make one. Who are we? We're the engineering students who can make anything but girlfriends. What are you doing? Why do you need to buy a wheelchair anyway? Hey, hey! Bicycle Store Bicycle Store I'm home. Hi, my son. Dad, let me use this for a while. Hey! You haven't heard from him yet? You said you got that jerk's contact info. Give me his info. He's not a jerk. I'll take care of this. Mind your own business. You should've taken him to the police station when this happened to your sister. Why did you let him go? He said he'd compensate me for it. We should just wait. All she needs is a wheelchair? What if he fell down the stairs? A jerk like him should be sent to the police station on charges of assault, right now. Again, I'm taking care of my own business. Everybody, stay out of it. Wait up. Timing and subtitles brought to you by ‚ù§Ô∏èMy Bossy Girlü§ñ Team @ Viki Gym for the Handicapped How can I help you? Is this an archery center for the handicapped? Archery... Are you singing up? N-No... Archery is great. Archery is an amazing rehab sport for the handicapped. It's not aggressive. It helps foster mental balance. Grabbing a bow makes you calm... Darn it, I'm never going to get it right, today. Are the crosshairs tilted? The crosshairs are fine. What's tilted is your mental status. While you're here, would you like to try it calmly? No, I'm actually here to see Gang Hye Jin. Gang Hye Jin? Hye Jin! Wait. Let me finish this first. Don't mind me. Take your time please. Who is he? I don't know. Who is this guy? I don't know, either. Who could he be? When an arrow hits the yellow mark, it's called X, in other words... Hitting the belly button. When an arrow hits the X in the middle, it's called Perfect Gold, right? Wow, you know a lot about this. Are you done already? My friend is visiting. Also, I can't train anymore today because you made me upset. Don't use me as an excuse. The selection match for the national team is around the corner. Don't you know my routine? This good feeling lasts when I hit the mark and then stop. You'd be in trouble if you weren't handicapped. I wouldn't do archery if I wasn't handicapped. Okay, since your friend's here to see you, let's call it a day. Let me check if Yu Jin is still at work. Did you know he wasn't handicapped? What are you doing here? You haven't called me for a week. I thought you ran away. I had to make sure the transaxle break was stabilized, which took me a long time. What? The transaxle break... What is this? I don't have enough money, because I'm a student. So, I made it myself. For real? Wow, you really are an engineering student. Can I try it now? Sure, try. Let me hold this. Then... It's working. Wow, it's really working. It's fast, too. Awesome. I love it. It won't have technical problems. Let's go do it. What? You guys should come too. Already? What do you mean, already? This is perfect timing. You know it's your turn this time, right? By the way, what is this thing? Ah, this is a light. You can have some light, even at night. Oh my god. That's crazy. Come on. Let's go. W-Where are we... Is there going to be some music too? She's super-fast. Hey, wait up. Hey! Let's have a ritual for my new wheelchair. What an excuse maker! Cheers! Bottoms up! Hang on. In my body, I have less acetaldehyde enzymes, which break down alcohol, than normal people... A-Ace... what? Acet! If you don't drink this, we won't be friends. - Bottoms up. - Bottoms up! You're doing great. We're friends... You're a good archer. You're good in a wheelchair. You're like the Egyptian tank corps! When she first came here in a wheelchair, she was such a downer. She's been acting like a human since she started archery. Human? Nah, she's more like a madwoman. You suckers, stop making fun of me. You should be quiet. Everybody, cheers! - Cheers! - Cheers! I love this beer! Oh, no. Our doctor really lacks acet... or something. I should get him home. Send him home right away, don't be naughty. Are you crazy? Hwi So, are you all right? Mom! Dad! She's my friend. Thank you so much. I'm Hwi So's friend. A female friend. You have nothing to worry about. This is the first time Hwi So has brought a friend, and come home drunk. I am so sorry. I will never make him drink again. No, please don't get me wrong. Please keep drinking with him and be close with him. It's just that this hasn't happened before, I don't know what to do. I'm sorry. Surveillance I should get going. Ah, okay! Thanks for taking my son home. Please come again. I hope to see you soon. Yes, I will. Thank you. Have a good night. Thank you for the noodles. No problem. Goodbye. Sorry about that! Timing and subtitles brought to you by ‚ù§Ô∏èMy Bossy Girlü§ñ Team @ Viki I love you. I love you. How is it? Do you feel like you're hugging your mom or boyfriend? It's cozy and warm, but I'm not sure. Try harder. Harder? All right. Here we go. I love you. I think I heard something. Hey, my r-ribs... Ribs! Let go! Are you OK? Don't tell me your ribs are broken. It's OK if your ribs just have cracks. Please tell me they are not broken. Cracked ribs are fine. You scared me. Man, I'm dying. What's wrong? What's going on? Jeez, what the hell? Gentlemen, today is the day. What day? The day of the match. Let's not lose and be humiliated and cry again, like we did last year. Yeah, the penalty... My butt... Let's beat them this year and get our pride back. Good, but who is competing from our department? Call anyone you know, especially the good ones. Can I call the Egyptian tank corps? Call the Egyptian tank corps, whatever that is. Call Rambo, Commando, and everyone else. The real war begins now. Sparta! Didn't you say the Egyptian tank corps? She is the Egyptian tank corps. You don't have to do this. You can just relax. No, I'm a good shot. We can win as long as we use this thermal imaging camera. Technical developments bring triumph in war. We don't even need walkie-talkies if we share our brainwaves. We're so beating the electronics department. Let's go get them. You suck. You OK? You said technical developments bring triumph in war. Look, using an EMP was too much. How did they know? I have a friend from the electronics department. I asked him to keep it a secret when I was borrowing the thermal imaging camera. I'm sure you know him, too. What a big mouth he has. Anyway, I wasn't being careful. Sorry guys. Well, we used the thermal imaging camera. It wasn't fair either. You generous bastard! Not getting a Ph. D degree is humiliating enough. I don't want to have to show off my butt again. Aren't you humiliated? Did your butt get spanked? No, we had to show our butts. We took off our pants. Shut it. Enough about butts. Fine. I thought this was just for fun, but it's about pride. Let me help you guys win this thing. Oh, look, it's pink. It's so pretty. You, from the electronics department, You're going down. Hey, get up already. It's over, isn't it? Hey, get ready to show your butts. What is that? Hey, pick it up. Good work, stick to the plan. Am I pretty enough to use my beauty? No, you're just bait. Hwi So, turn me around. Over there. Turn me around. I got him. Only one guy left. He's going to go down or he's going to survive. We're pushing it. There is a saying. What? What are you talking about? I don't know. Anyway, those bastards can't beat us with those guns. Go get them. You're so sexy. La Jin, let's attack! Hell yes! Say it louder. Hell yes! There's only one guy left. Hey, stop moving. What is that thing? Back! Back! Are you okay? This is so much fun. Is this fun? Looks like our team lost. Is that fun for you? Do you know what the good thing about a bow is? They can be fired from a higher angle. You got him. Perfect! We won. We'll see you guys next year. Definitely. You've got pretty butts. You, too! Hit the road! Goodbye! We won! That felt so good. Look, this is perfect for a profile picture. Hye Jin, you are our hero today. Aren't professionals supposed to be that good? You're a hero. Hwi So, how did you bring a hero here? This sucks. I'm tired. I'm getting out of here. Be that way. She's not sweet. There are so many stars here. I barely see a single star in the city. It's so nice to get away from the busy city and see these stars here. Thank you. For what? You know what for. It's hard for people like us to come to a place like this without someone's help. That's one of the reasons why I'm an archer. Would you be more specific? I'm not capable of going some places on four wheels. But arrows can fly in the air freely and be targeted, which makes me feel free and cool. I like that expression, feel free. Right? I like the word, free. I want to win this game and be free. The selection match for the national team, I'm coming for you! By the way, why do you like robots so much? They help humans live easier lives. So, what you're saying is robots do work for humans? Not necessarily. Robots do some work humans can't do and they help us. There's something the handicapped always say. "Can you do it on your own or not?" If you can do it on your own, you do it by yourself no matter how much time it takes. But, if you can't do it on your own and you need someone's help, I would love to get help from a human rather than a robot. Human help? Uh? What's this? What? Is there something on my shirt? Yeah. They're kissing. Record it. Of course it's already being recorded. I'm a love expert. Does Hwi So know how to kiss? - Oh my god! - Geez. I knew it. Come to think of it, you're worse than Hwi So. Come one out already. How long has she been there? Hey, how long have you been there? From the beginning. Jesus Christ! How far can you go? Wow, you're doing great. You're so cool. Hey, stop it. Fine, fine. Timing and subtitles brought to you by ‚ù§Ô∏èMy Bossy Girlü§ñ Team @ Viki Try again. Your elbow!! Like this? Oh! I got it! I got one! X! X! Hey... I think you're amazing. Look... You can keep it if you want. Nah, you should keep your first medal. Medal? Yeah. I'm going to beat you. Timing and subtitles brought to you by ‚ù§Ô∏èMy Bossy Girlü§ñ Team @ Viki NO PDA You cannot reach this person. After beep... Why isn't she picking up? This is similar to this... I'm home. Where's your sister? I don't know. She's not home yet? at this hour? Aren't you even worried about her? Five points. Do better. Hello, sir? Is Hye Jin there now? Ah... She was practicing hard here... Maybe she is in the bathroom? Hello? Same father, same daughter. You guys, work harder for Hye Jin's share. Three points? Dad... It's not like anyone can be an exchange student. I really don't want to miss this great opportunity. What about your sister then? Just for two years, Mom can... Hey! Don't even bring that woman up ever again. Dad, please... I'm not stopping you from going abroad. I want you to go after your sister gets married. When is she getting married? You know she's not interested in marriage. I can't let her live her life alone like that. I'm looking for a good man for her, so she'll get married soon. I'm going to live alone forever. Where have you been all day? Why didn't you pick up your phone? I was with my friend. Friend who? You wouldn't know. I notice that you came home late using archery practice as an excuse. What are you trying to say? You know Dong Hun, who's working for me? We're having a meal with Dong Hun and his mom. So? Dong Hun's mom saw your picture and she said you're pretty. I already had a conversation with them, so you can do whatever I tell you to do. Did he say he'd marry me because you told him you'd give him your store? What if he abandons me after getting your store? He's been working for me for ten years. He's a sweet and diligent man. You listened to him well too. That's what you think. Stop doing archery and start taking cooking classes or something. What a disgusting deal. "I'll give you my money, you take my daughter." If you want to give me away, why don't you ask someone to kill your leg-retarded-daughter? Hye Jin, you're overreacting. Where do you think you're going now? Don't follow me, or I'm going to kill myself. Uh? What is Hye Jin doing here? She looks so real. Because I am real. Hye Jin! Can I try that on? This? Yeah. Doesn't it look real? Basically, you could get in the car, you could be on a plane with that on. You could go anywhere. I want to stop. This is not real. Technically, yes. Because it's virtual reality. So, basically virtual means fake. Just because I put this on doesn't mean I can actually walk. You're right. I'm sorry. Why are you sorry? It was still nice to walk. It's been a while. I should go. I'll be busy because of the selection match for the national team. I see. Can I go watch you? Sure, you should come! I will be there. Goodbye. Take care. You're not going to take me home? Come on, you're so drunk. My hand would get sweaty. Don't do this. I'm hot. If you're being like this, I'm going to eat you up. People might see us. Please! If you're acting like that, I'm going to eat you up. Do you know him? He's my stalker. Your classmate? I said he's my stalker. Is he the doctor you were talking about? Yeah, he is. This doctor doesn't look so hot. What did you do to get Ha Na to go out with you? We're not in a relationship. Then what are you doing? Are you playing with her? Ha Na, why are you seeing a guy like him? Because he's smart. I hate stupid men the most. Do you even have eyes? Can you see? Obviously, he's out of your league. You're more out of my league than he is. What is it that makes this nerd better than me? How come he can't get it? I don't like you because you're stupid. Hey, stop it. Stupid! When you were tutoring me, you said you'd go out with me when I got into a college. Teachers shouldn't lie to their students. Was he your teacher? What a piece of shit. What did you say? Piece of shit. What the hell did you say? Piece of shit. I can't believe it. Apologize to him right now. Hey, forget it. I'm okay. Apologize to him now. Ha Na, are you all right? Mr. Nerd. This is how it works in this neighborhood. Be gone if you don't want to get beaten. What a freaking retard! What is he? Are you kidding me? Come on, follow me. No! Come on now. Hey, wait. What now? Do you see the surveillance camera over there? What about it? Those are from the company, Catch One. Their cameras are 2 pixels and HD quality. So? Are you going to sue me with the camera proof? No, that's not what I mean. Since there are cameras over there, I've got the leverage, you bastard. Oh my god. Arg, this hurts. Oh no, you must be in pain. Honey, are you okay? You've got to hug it as if you love it. Okay. Go ahead. I love you. Is this broken? This is weird. Try to hug me this time. Okay. I love you. It's definitely broken. You can go home. Don't be late tomorrow. Why don't you have a girlfriend? You are always talking about girls. There are many girls who have a crush on you. Not many... Just the right amount of girls... You look the hottest when you're working at the lab. Are you kidding me? This is just an engineering nerd's life. That's why you look cool because I'm an engineering girl. I love you. You're mistaken. Think deeply and seriously. Leave. Don't be late or you'll be in trouble. Machines don't lie. Your machine might think you like me, but mine doesn't. Just leave. Just don't be late tomorrow. Don't run, it's dusty in here. Actually, that machine is yours. Timing and subtitles brought to you by ‚ù§Ô∏èMy Bossy Girlü§ñ Team @ Viki How is my ex-husband? How are you two getting along? No, I'm having a hard time because of that man. I wish I could divorce him. One divorce in one family is enough. We don't want that to be our family tradition. Mom, can I live with you? Absolutely not. I finally feel free. I don't want to have any more burdens. I won't ever be able to remarry if I live with you. You're selfish. People should live selfishly. If you have an altruistic mind, you end up like your dad. What am I supposed to do then? Living with Dad is choking me. What is this? $30,000. Move out with this money. Your dad and Hye Gyeong deserve to be free from you, too. How long are you planning on harassing them? Mom, I can't get a place with this money. Do you know how much it costs to get a place? You should spend more. Getting the rest is your homework. You're being cheap. I'll take it back if you don't want it. I've been good with my homework since I was a kid. Thank you so much. You should stop saying you can do everything on your own. You've got to prove that you can actually do stuff. That's the only way you can beat your dad. Please stop! Coach, I can do it. Yeong Cheol, take a deep breath. It's not going to work. I'm taking Yeong Cheol to a hospital then I'm coming to you. When the assistant administrator gets here, you guys should go first. Okay. Yeong Cheol, come on. Please text us. I'll let you know. Hwi So! What's going on with Yeong Cheol? We feel muscle spasms after sitting in a wheelchair for a long time. Hey, can you drive us? The thing is, I don't have a driver's license. Bummer. I can't believe you still don't have a driver's license. You'd be so cool if you could drive us now. I guess. The assistant administrator is here. Hwi So, get in there. I forgot that I was supposed to see my professor. I don't think I can come... Is it okay? That sucks. That's okay. We'll be back and then we can see you. Good luck. Bye. I'll take her car, bye. Bye. Hwi So's been traumatized since he was a kid. So, he can't stay in small enclosed spaces. That's why he took that car. What trauma? We don't know. He doesn't talk about that kind of stuff. What are you doing? I'm going to get a driver's license. What, are you crazy? Why? Just cause... I want to drive a car. Cut the crap. You can't even be in a car. It's because of Hye Jin, isn't it? Did you just ignore me? Where are we going? I can do it. I can do it. Hey, it's okay! Don't be nervous. Relax. I'm closing the roof. No, no, no... Nonsense! I'm doing it. Hang on, hang on! Stop being a baby. Let me guide you. W-wait. Wait! Listen. Breathe through this, okay? Breathe now. Exhale. It's working. Try again. It's this simple, okay? Start! Here we go! Hwi So, you're good! Nice! He's good. Yeah, he doesn't suck. It's hard to breathe... Really? Then take that off. How am I supposed to breathe without that? Breathe through your nose. N-nose? Hwi So, speed up. Let's go. Were those the swimming goggles that got thrown out? Way to go! I'm driving. Nice job. Wow. Fantastic! You're doing great! I can drive. Let's speed up more. Come on. Faster? The First Selection Match for the National Team Timing and subtitles brought to you by ‚ù§Ô∏èMy Bossy Girlü§ñ Team @ Viki Congratulations. You passed the test. Gang Hye Jin, wow! You are amazing! Let's stay focused! If you miss just one shot out of 4,055, you won't win, okay? You said exactly the same thing four years ago. What I'm saying is, you've got to stay focused until the match is over. Focus, you know? You're focusing on your phone. Nagging, nagging. Here, Yeong Cheol. Thank you. Okay, is this everything? Yeah, I think we're ready. Let's go. Okay. Hwi So! What are you doing here? Did you drive here alone? Yeah. "Can you do it on your own or not?" I did it on my own. Wow, Hwi So, you rock. A Damas is not what I was expecting, though. He drove himself, what is the big deal? Hey, are we leaving or not? I'm leaving. I'm taking this doctor's car. Okay. We only have a bachelor's degree. Let's go on our own. I have a master's degree. Eun Jeong, let's go. I didn't go to high school. Ah, I didn't know. I'm sorry. My bad. You're driving super well. Timing and subtitles brought to you by ‚ù§Ô∏èMy Bossy Girlü§ñ Team @ Viki Are you okay? I was talking in my sleep, wasn't I? Yeah, you were. What did I say? Just... nothing special. Out of curiosity, why haven't you asked me what happened to my legs? People always ask that question when they first meet handicapped people. I heard it takes a long time for deep wounds to heal. The wound could get infected if we try to take the band-aid off before it heals perfectly. We shouldn't take the band-aid off before it's ready. That's what your mom said, right? I like your mom so much. She is amazing. My high school teacher said it, not my mom. You have good people around you. High tech, cutting edge VR goggles... Do you have to wear this while driving? Yeah, it's my routine. You know the word, routine. You're an athlete now. Look out. It's vacation time. Do you think it's okay? It's okay because it's vacation. I think he'll be awake after being stuck in days. Hey, close the door before he gets out. - Explanation nerd. - What a serious bastard. - Single-minded. Mr. Know It All. - Stop asking questions after classes. - I hate him so much. - Look at him. What a mama's boy. Don't! Don't do it. Let me out. Please don't do that. Let me get out of here. Get me out of here. I'm sorry. Don't do it! Hwi So, calm down. No, no! I'm sorry. Get me out of here now. Hwi So, wake up. Calm down. Hey, Hwi So! Hwi So! Hwi So, wake up! Wake up! I'm so sorry. Hwi So is fine. He fainted because of his panic disorder. The doctor took an X-ray and CT scan and he didn't find anything wrong. So don't worry. I am deeply sorry. It's my fault. It's nobody's fault. It was just an accident. You have no idea how thankful I am to you. Since meeting you, he's gotten drunk and driven. So please don't worry. Keep hanging out with him as usual. Hye Jin! We need to talk. I forgot to pay the hospital bills. I'll let you two talk. Do you get it now? Get what? You're not supposed to date a guy like him. A guy like him? You've got to meet a man who's healthy both physically and mentally. That's the only way you can survive. Dad. Parents whose children are handicapped have one hope. They hope to live one more day than their children. But I can't be with you forever, so you need to meet a person Who can be there on my behalf. Handicapped people aren't kids. I can take care of myself, so stop treating me like a child. Hye Jin! Please live your own life. When you're happy, I can be happy. Hye Jin! Hye Jin! Are you all right? We should stop seeing each other. Why? No reason, I just think we should stop. I'm sorry. Han Hwi So! If you want to keep living your life by running away, just don't ever leave your own room. Should I stop archery? What about Hwi So? I'm sure he's fine. Did you guys break up? We weren't actually in a relationship or anything. Hey, come here. Why? Just get over here. Stop acting like you're fine. If you're hurt, just say it. I must have been mistaken while I was with Hwi So. I didn't realize Hwi So was not an ordinary man. I just treated him the way I wanted to. You did what you did because you love him. "Disabilities are inconvenient, but they aren't misfortunes." That's what Helen Keller said. What are you doing there? Let's go for a drink. We are already inconvenienced enough, but if we are unhappy too, our life literally sucks. Let's shake it off after we drink. Is this on you? I've just become unhappy. Darn it. You keep making me unhappy. Let's just go. There's a saying that your spirit becomes pretty if you die after drinking. Let's go. I'll meet you there. Don't come too late. What are you doing? Would you take out the cello? Huh? Why? You haven't even wanted to look at it since the accident. I'm going to sell it. I thought you were going to play it at some point. I've kept it to sell it when I need money. It could make me some good money. Hang on. Let me play it one last time. Wow, it's been a while since the last time I grabbed the arrow. rThat's not true. You hold arrows every day. You're right. This is an arrow and I grab the other arrows too. Maybe that's why I'm good with arrows. Don't be silly. Timing and subtitles brought to you by ‚ù§Ô∏èMy Bossy Girlü§ñ Team @ Viki The final selection match for the national team is about to start. The Final Selection Match for the National Team The final selection match for the national team is about to start. The Final Selection Match for the National Team The Final Selection Match for the National Team Athletes, please get ready. The Final Selection Match for the National Team Don't think about anything else. Try to be in control, just like you've practiced. Stay focused. Hey, is this the right place? Are you sure it's the right place? I asked first. What the hell! Don't you hear anything? Apparently, Yong Tae and Ha Na are dating. They're getting married. They're also getting pregnant. Pregnant? Why would you hit him? We can get married soon. We are dating, too. For real? Okay, let's take care of this first and then talk. I'll get this done in two shots. Give me a different tool. With this tool, you will open it for sure. Are you not coming? Hye Jin might not be chosen for the national team. Archery is all about mental stability. How come you're just running away like this? There's what the handicapped always say. "If you can do it on your own, you do it by yourself no matter how much time it takes." But, if you can't do it on your own and you need someone's help, I would love to get help from a human instead of a robot. If I need help, would you come and help me? Hye Jin helped you drive. What are you doing to her? If she fails, it's all your fault. Take her mental state back. Jeez, you scared me. Are you okay? Where are you going? Are you going to her? Timing and subtitles brought to you by ‚ù§Ô∏èMy Bossy Girlü§ñ Team @ Viki If you tie them twice, like this, your laces won't come untied so easily. Are you sure you can see? Hwi So, drive the way you learned. There's a car coming. Man, this isn't good. Hye Jin, your arrows are spraying all over toward three o'clock. Aim for nine o'clock. Don't move your left arm until the end. That's what I have been doing. Look at the people. There's a car in front of us, you crazy bastard. He fainted. We're supposed to get married. - Wake up. - Come on, man. Dude, why did you take this off? You've got to relax. Again! The selection match for the national team, The th round is about to start. Athletes, please get ready. Hye Jin, you've been good. Keep up the good work. Aim for nine o'clock resolutely! I did it last time and it didn't work out. I'll do it my way. Okay, good! Go for it! Let's get it over with and go for a drink. Where is she? I think she's over there. Hye Jin! Hwi So! I thought I was a burden to you. But I'm going to stop running away. I want to be with you. I want to be there for you when you have a hard time. Just like you did for me. Go, crush all of them like Gang Hye Jin. I'll go win. Of course. The match is starting in one minute. Get ready please. Is that Hye Jin? Yeah, that's her. It's raining. Bad timing. Nine! Final score, Kim Ji Hyun, 348 points. Gang Hye Jin, 348 points. Two players both have the same score. It's a tie. Since they have the same score, we'll have a shoot-off. A shoot-off! Whoever shoots the closest to the middle wins. I can't believe the match is still going on In this kind of downpour. That's exactly what I don't understand. The match will go on until the target board falls down. Even when there's a storm? Then the target board will fall. Ten! Hye Jin, you can do this. Just right in the middle! Aim for nine o'clock! You got this. You go girl. You've been good. Keep up the good work. Aim for nine o'clock resolutely! Arrows can fly in the air freely and get targeted, which makes me feel free and cool. She got it! X! X? Dad, she got it. X! X! Oh my god! She did it! She is joining the national team. - X! - You made it! Korean national team member, Gang Hye Jin! This is heavy. There! Take this. You didn't have to do this. My daughter is smart enough to be an exchange student and she's going abroad to study. Did you think I was going to just send you like that? Thank you, Dad. It's not a big deal, sweetheart. I would look super cool if I gave you the money that I could've made from selling the cello. Stop talking nonsense. You'll be in big trouble if you say you're going to sell the cello ever again. Selling the cello is basically selling the memories with your dad. I don't want to lose my memories with my daughter just for a little money. Wow, our dad is awesome! Now you know? But are you two going to be okay? We will survive. Dad! Now you want peace? Count me in. These pains in the ass! Go, take care of yourself. Call me when you get there. Don't fight. Goodbye. Goodbye. Congratulations on Gil Yong Tae and Hwang Ha Na's marriage. Where is ours? Ours is... right here. What is that? I know. She's like a cicada. Are you guys twins or something? Are you guys twins or something? Doctor Han Hwi So is taken. Doctor Han Hwi So is taken after being single for 9998 days. If he had waited for two days, he could have been a wizard. National team member Gang Hye Jin met an engineering guy. If he had waited for 2 days, he could have been a wizard. Dude! That's a bummer. If Hwi So had super powers, I would ask him to make my honey taller. I would ask him to make your IQ higher. You're not nice. I'm starving. Should we go eat pork cutlet? Deal! Deal! - Deal. - Deal. You can have a different one. Fine. Are we supposed to take these stairs? This place is good, though. What did Hwi So say? "Face it instead of running away." You're so young and healthy. Lift her. Lift? H-Hang on. Hye Jin, would you push that button? This one? What is going on? Is this upgraded? They are robot legs. What the hell is going on? I knew it. If he was able to make this, he should be at NASA by now. Aren't we the ones who should be embarrassed? It worked fine in my office. I don't understand. Piggy back! Sure! Give me a piggy back, too. Forget about the pork cutlet. That food is oily and not good. Also, what was the chef thinking? Why is there a restaurant up there? I'm not doing this. Stop talking. Hop on. Hey, dude! What the hell are you doing? Come on, Honey. Why do we have to do this? You can do it. We can do it. You're as light as a feather. Let's go. Let's go eat the pork cutlet. Let's go. I don't like pork cutlet. I want an omelet. Let's go. Let's eat pork cutlet. Hello, Chef! My Bossy Girl My Bossy Girl Hello! Hi, Ha Mi!
