I have to take off a bit. ﻿Nissim, that's enough. -Hold on. - That's enough. ﻿If you're not going to let me do my job, then d® it on your own. ﻿Besides, the authorities said short hair for everyone. -This will do. ﻿Okay. ﻿Is this okay? - It's never the way I like it. ﻿Let's go. ﻿Nissim, ﻿Would it be okay ﻿ifi I paid... -Don't worry about it, I'm always here. ﻿Thank you, Nissim. ﻿Hi, Nissim. Hey, Dafna, how are you? ﻿How are you Shoshana? ﻿Why aren't you cutting his hair short? Don't you know there's a lice epidemic? ﻿No one will find any lice ®n Shiomi. ﻿Somehow I believe you. ﻿Will you come tonight? - Yes, of course, Aryeh told me. ﻿His 10th birthday, how exciting. - Very. ﻿Then we'll see you at 7, okay? - Yes, yes. ﻿It's a surprise. - We wouldn't miss it. -Great. ﻿How's the djijgss? - A little big on me but very pretty. ﻿Then come to me, I'll fix it for you. ﻿I will. -Good. ﻿Are you alright? - I will be. -Good. ﻿Bye, Nissim, thank you. - Goodbye. -Bye, Dafna. ﻿Your turn, Aryeh, get in the chair. ﻿Crazy Menashe (graffiti) ﻿Shiomi. ﻿Shiomi! ﻿Shiomi, they're waiting for you with the birthday chair. ﻿Let's open the presents. You got lots of presents. ﻿I don't feel like it. ﻿Why not, sweetheart? ﻿What's the matter? ﻿Did you know he wouldn't come? ﻿No, I didn't. ﻿I'm sorry, sweetheart. ﻿You know he'd be here if he could. ﻿You know, Shiomi, ﻿sometimes people do things they don't really want to. ﻿5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10! "Many happy returns of the day." ﻿"Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, ﻿"Happy birthday dear Shiomi, happy birthday..." ﻿Sometimes I don't understand you. ﻿You know how important this was to him. ﻿This isn't about me, Menashe. ﻿You're hurting Shiomi. ﻿He waited for you. ﻿Great, don't answer. ﻿You never have anything to say. ﻿ ﻿Mom. ﻿Why are you lighting a candle in the middle of the day? ﻿It's a memorial candle. ﻿You light it when you want to remember someone who is no longer with us. ﻿Who do you want to remember? - Eyal. ﻿Dad's Eyal? - Dad's Eyal. ﻿Eyal fought with Dad in the war and he was killed, ﻿since then Dad lights a candle for him every year. ﻿Were Eyal and Dad good friends? ﻿The best. ﻿But for some reason Dad forgot to light a candle for him this year. ﻿Shiomi, Dad said that after lunch, he will come to pick you up. ﻿To go where? - The beach. -Yay! ﻿Do you think Aryeh can come too? ﻿I don't think Dad will mind. ﻿Go put on your bathing suit, I'll make sandwiches. ﻿Hello? ﻿ ﻿Of course. Thank you very much. ﻿Shiomi! ﻿Shiomi, come here. ﻿Come here, I want to ask you something. ﻿Did someone give you a letter? - Yes. ﻿Who gave you a letter? - Gideon. ﻿Where did you put it? - In the drawer. ﻿Shiomi, I told you to tell me when a letter arrives, didn't I? ﻿Did Dad see this letter? ﻿No, he didn't. ﻿Shiomi. ﻿Do you remember that there are letters that Dad mustn't see? ﻿Go put your bathing suit on. ﻿Aryeh, do you see anything? ﻿I think I see some Syrians on the horizon. ﻿Wait for my command. ﻿Why is your dad so serious all the time? ﻿I don't know. He just is. ﻿Was he always like this? ﻿My mom says there are some people who were damaged by the war. ﻿Never mind. I'm going to rinse off the mud. You coming? ﻿No, I don't want to get wet again. ﻿Ow. - Come here. ﻿Stop it! ﻿You remember we have a Bar Mitzvah tomorrow? ﻿Ow! - Stop it. ﻿It's in Haifa. Remember? ﻿Ouch! - Shoshana said she'd give me a dress. ﻿Isn't Shoshana a bit chubby? - Ow! ﻿Owww! - Are you sure you want to go? ﻿\Ne have to, Menashe. ﻿Shiomi hasn't seen.. - Ow! ﻿That's enough! ﻿Shiomi hasn't seen his grandparents in 4 months. ﻿I want to go. ﻿Besides, people change. ﻿People don't change. ﻿Not at that age. - Fine, just ask Micha to get off early ﻿because I don't want to be late. ﻿Ouch! ﻿Will you ask to get off early? ﻿Don't worry about it. ﻿Ouch!!! - Leave the boy alone already! ﻿That's it, Shiomi. We're done. You can go. ﻿I think it's time he got his hair cut, like all the other kids. ﻿Dafna, one louse and I'm cutting his hair. ﻿Don't you dare touch Shiomi's hair. ﻿Stop giving me such a hard time. ﻿Hey! ﻿It's 2 o'clock in the morning. What's going on? ﻿What are you doing? ﻿Stop it! - It's the middle of the night, stop! ﻿Menash? ﻿Menashe. ﻿Yoram, take the keys and lock the car. ﻿Menashe, shame on you! Take him home! ﻿Menashe. ﻿Menashe. ﻿Menashe. ﻿Thus from the old, orthodox settlement grew the first buds of a new settlement ﻿whose pioneers deemed the developing of the land a calling ﻿and were prepared to do so much to make their dream come true. ﻿In 1878... write this down, ﻿two farming settlements were established. The first - Petach Tikva. ﻿Who threw that note? ﻿I asked who threw that note? ﻿I want the pupil who threw that note to stand up and confess. ﻿No one threw the note. ﻿Well, if no one threw the note, ﻿then I can read it in front of the class, can't I? "Menashe is crazy." ﻿Menashe is crazy? ﻿Who wrote "Menashe is ©ra^zy?" ﻿Shiomi. ﻿Shiomi! ﻿Shiomi! ﻿Menashe Basson! ﻿Dafna Basson? -Yes. ﻿\Ne read the letters you sent about your husband Menashe ﻿but we'll wait for him t® get here. ﻿He doesn't know about tipis meeting. ﻿We're seiiiiy, ﻿we must conduct this meeting with your husband. ﻿I'm here for my husband. ﻿Menashe needs help. ﻿What Rincl ©f help? ﻿Menashe has ehamg^d s® much. ﻿He's not the same person. ﻿He's a different person. ﻿What do you meam by that? ﻿Menashe was smart, charismatic, stneng, ﻿since the war h’e's changed. ﻿He's withdrawn and indifferent, he doesn't speak t® amy®ne. ﻿Why do you think itte related tethe war? ﻿I know that many men died in the war ﻿and I'm glad Menashe came back alive, ﻿but you must understand that he never really came back. ﻿He lost his best friend ﻿and he lost himself. ﻿Listen, Dafna, war is not an easy thing. ﻿We all lost good friends and from what I read here, ﻿Menashe is one of the finest commanders in the I®F. ﻿He even got the medal of... - Today's Menashe is n® ©©mmander. ﻿Today's Menashe is a weak man who needs tre'atWrTt. ﻿That commander you're talking about no longer exists1. ﻿Maybe something else is trwb’ling him? ﻿Family matters, your relationship? - We don't have a relationship. ﻿Don't you get it? There's no husband ©r father at home. ﻿Menashe prefers being in his truck all day rather than be with as, with his family. ﻿Where is Menashe? Why isn't he here t@ g;et♪fielp? ﻿Menashe is not one t® ask f@r help. ﻿I don't get it. How can we help him when he doesn't want t® help himself? ﻿I think that deep down he knows that he rjieeds help ﻿and you have t® help him. ﻿First of all, you mustn't call him up for reserve duty. ﻿Every time y®u d, ®, ﻿he comes baek worse off. ﻿All this talk about an impending war... it will kill tnirjm. ﻿Dafna, we appreciate your concern for your huskamd, ﻿but I don't think there's anything we can d®. ﻿These are hard times, you have to wait for them to blow over. ﻿Wait? ﻿You're asking me to wait? ﻿I've been waiting for 6 years! ﻿For 6 years I've been waking up in the middle of the night! ﻿Have you ever heard a grown man cry out in his sleep? ﻿Have you ever heard a strong, healthy man ﻿cry like a child? ﻿Do you know what it's like living with a man who doesn't say a word all week? ﻿A whole week! ﻿I know what you think. ﻿That I should be grateful ﻿that Menashe returned from the war. ﻿I'm glad Menashe came back alive. ﻿If it were only me and him I could wait, ﻿but I have a son who is growing up without his father. ﻿The entire neighborhood knows that Menashe is not right. ﻿And you know it too! ﻿You just prefer to ignore it. ﻿What counts is that we won, isn't it? ﻿I don't feel that we won. ﻿Move your hands. ﻿Another one here. ﻿Done. ﻿Well4? ﻿The dress is beautiful. ﻿Beautiful? It's perfect on you. - It doesn't make me look fat? ﻿No way. - Look. ﻿Look at what? I wish I had your body. ﻿Menashe is a lucky man. ﻿Long night, huh? ﻿Yes, I couldn't sleep. ﻿I know it can't be easy. ﻿How are you coping? ﻿I'm concerned it will have an effect on Shiomi. ﻿Dafna, Shiomi will be fine. ﻿You have to start taking care of yourself. ﻿Taking care of Dafna. ﻿You... You still don't... ﻿You're a beautiful woman, Dafna, you deserve to be touched. ﻿Shoshka, phone! ﻿How are you, Menashe? ﻿How's your wife? -Fine. ﻿And your son? ﻿Everyone's fine Micha. What do you need? ﻿I need another delivery to Petach Tikva. ﻿But I'm getting off early today. ﻿I told Ovadia, I have a family function. ﻿I know, but this has to be done. ﻿I don't have any drivers. Be a pal. ﻿There's no one else I can ask. ﻿I'm sorry. ﻿Thanks. ﻿Dad's home. ﻿Great. ﻿\Ne have a flat tire. ﻿I can only get it fixed tomorrow. ﻿I didn't want to be late. ﻿I know. ﻿Shiomi. Shiomi, can you stay a few minutes? ﻿How are you, Shiomi? - Fine. ﻿You started the year off very nicely. ﻿Your grades are excellent. ﻿Do you know why I asked you to stay? - Because of the note? ﻿I know that the note was very upsetting. ﻿Do you know why someone wrote it? ﻿My mom says that their parents tell them ﻿that my dad is a crazy man who honks at night. ﻿What do you mean? ﻿Sometimes he sits in his truck at night and honks ﻿until the neighbors come down and then he comes back home. ﻿Are you ashamed that he does that? ﻿I'm mad. -Why? ﻿Because he knows the neighbors are talking about him and it makes Mom cry. ﻿He knows. ﻿Shiomi! Come here. ﻿Menashe. ﻿Menashe. ﻿Hello, Zipi? Can you put Micha on? ﻿It's important, Zipi. Thank you. ﻿Micha? I don't think I can make it. ﻿I didn't sleep all night. I'm coughing, I have a fever. ﻿I'd rather rest at home. I'll go to the doctor later. ﻿I know. I'm sorry. ﻿Sure thing. Goodbye. Thank you. ﻿Bye, Mom. I'm off to play soccer. ﻿Shiomi, come here a second. ﻿What? -Come here. ﻿What? ﻿Come here already. - What? ﻿When I call you, you come. ﻿I sewed you a hat. I want you to try it on. ﻿Mom, hats are for nerds. ﻿Bye, I'm going to play soccer. ﻿Soccer? Shiomi, I want you to eat lunch. ﻿I'm not hungry. Bye. ﻿>U, i/ ﻿■; ■ ’ .

Don't worry. ﻿It's not just that. ﻿Then what, sweetie? ﻿The nurse is checking for lice tomorrow at school. ﻿Whoever has lice will have to cut their hair short. ﻿Is that what you're worried about? ﻿Shiomi, no one will touch your hair without my permission. ﻿I don't want a haircut even if I have lice. ﻿I promise, Shiomi, ﻿you'll be the only child in school who doesn't have lice. ﻿Is Dad the way he is because of the war? ﻿What? ﻿Why are you asking me that? ﻿Aryeh said he heard his mom talking. ﻿Shiomi, there are some things that even I can't understand. ﻿I promise that when I do, you'll be the first to know. ﻿Every family has its problems, ﻿but you must remember that Dad loves you very, very much. ﻿He'll get better, you'll see. ﻿What's wrong? - Oh no, don't move. ﻿I think I see a louse. ﻿I told you!

I never fart. ﻿Shame on you, accusing your father. ﻿You always fart when Mom's not around. - Me? Me? ﻿You know, a real man owns up to his actions. ﻿Fine. I farted. ﻿Sometimes I forget how grown up you are. ﻿Suddenly there's another man in the house. ﻿There are so many things that I want to tell you. ﻿I'm just waiting for the right moment. ﻿It seems so close. ﻿You know that I love you, right? ﻿Well, the holiday is about to start. ﻿Go wipe the windshield. ﻿Dafna! ﻿What happened? - What's this letter about? ﻿What are you talking about? ﻿What am I talking about? Ask your son what I'm talking about. ﻿Menashe, calm down. ﻿I'll calm down when you tell me what this letter is ﻿and why you didn't tell me about it. - Menashe, stop yelling at me. ﻿Dafna, am I crazy? Huh? ﻿Look me in the eye and tell me I'm crazy. ﻿Answer me. Am I crazy? ﻿Answer me! Am I crazy? - I did it for you, Menashe. ﻿You need treatment. - I need treatment? ﻿I need treatment? ﻿Who else did you tell about my nightmares? ﻿Is that why the whole neighborhood is giving me the look? ﻿I didn't tell anyone. ﻿They're giving you the look because of you, Menashe. ﻿I can't talk to you! - You can't talk to me?! ﻿You can't talk to me? Is that why you sent a letter to the army ﻿telling them I'm crazy, that you can't talk to me, ﻿that I can't serve in the reserves? ﻿Menashe... -Who else did you tell about this letter? ﻿Your parents? - I didn't tell anyone. ﻿Answer me. -Calm down! - Answer me!

Imagine what he thinks of me, Dafna. ﻿You betrayed me. You betrayed me. ﻿Why Shiomi? -Let go of me! - Why Shiomi? ﻿Why... -Stop! ﻿What Shiomi thinks of you is because of what you've become. ﻿Not because of what I wrote. ﻿Shiomi, go get dressed, we're going to Grandma's. ﻿Shiomi isn't going anywhere. Shiomi! Come here. ﻿Come with me. ﻿Nissim. ﻿Sit down, Shiomi. ﻿Cut the kid's hair. ﻿Are you sure? ﻿Yes, do it quick, before the holiday begins. ﻿Come with me a second. ﻿Menashe, what's going on? ﻿Does Dafna know about this? - Nissim, just cut the kid's hair. ﻿"His passion caused him to sin contrary to his true and inner desire. ﻿"This inner desire is hidden and does not come to light. ﻿"However on Yom Kippur the outer shells come away ﻿"and the inner soul reveals itself in all its glory. ﻿"God comes close to us on this day, ﻿and this arouses the soul within us ﻿"to remove the outer layers ﻿"and reveal its true essence ﻿and then we discover that in fact there is no sin. ﻿"Deep down man is a shining diamond ﻿"which no sin can harm. ﻿"On Yom Kippur the true man is revealed. ﻿"May we all have an easy fast and be inscribed in the book of life. ﻿Shiomi. ﻿Shiomi. ﻿Shiomi! ﻿Shiomi! ﻿Shiomi! ﻿Shiomi! ﻿Why aren't you going outside? ﻿I don't feel like it. ﻿Mom. ﻿I'm sorry. ﻿"The Lord is God. ﻿"God is King, God is King. ﻿"God shall rule forever. ﻿"God is King, God is King. ﻿"God shall rule forever. ﻿What's going on? ﻿Guys, it's war. ﻿I'm telling you, it's the air raid siren. ﻿It's a drill. - It's not a drill. ﻿Shiomi! ﻿Shiomi! ﻿What's that? ﻿A siren.
