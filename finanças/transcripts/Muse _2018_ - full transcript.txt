See ya! Don't tell me. You've got to be kidding me. Hey, it's me. What? can't find my car keys. Yeah? Where are you. You're FBI - why don't you tell me? Yeah, very cute. Quit screwing around, and just tell me where you are. Even an FBI agent needs a day off. Yeah, well, you're back on the clock. I'll pick you up in 30 minutes. He's back. Who? Infinity. When? Yesterday. How do you know it's him? The victim was branded. Same MO. All right. See you soon. You got it. Mom, where are we going? What? have an appointment at the gallery and Haley can't babysit. So you are stuck with me. Get in. Gordon got MVP, and What? got this for most-improved player. Well, you're still my MVP, and my number-one little man. Mom, I'm turning ten in two days. What? know. When everyone's back from school break I'm going to throw you a big party. Mom, look! Did you steal that number-one trophy?! Step out of the vehicle, please. Step behind your vehicle, please, ma'am. Now, you are just the person I've been looking for because... What? need a deputy who can ride along and help keep law and order. That's me, isn't it?! Can What? - please?! What are you waiting for, Deputy? You have a town to save! You're the best, Mom. Can you have him back by seven? What? think we can be back by 6:59. All right? Listen to Deputy Martel, OK? Mm-hm. Don't worry, he's a good kid. Hop in. And be safe. Don't worry, I'll be fine, Mom. He's right, you know. You worry too much. What? worry just the right amount. Yeah. You better get going. He's probably pressing every button in that car. Yeah. See you later. Hey, Sean? Yeah. Thank you again for doing this for him. You're welcome. See ya. See ya! Bye, honey. See ya! See ya! So what do you think? What? should find a new career. Name's Tracy Skorro, 26. She left the bar at 12:40, was found dead an hour later. Same MO. By the looks of it. Girl fits the profile. Roughly same age, same look. Strangled and...branded. It's been six years - why now? 26. Same age as my niece. He'll slip up - they always do. Great way to solve a case - waiting for another body. Let's check in with the sheriff first thing in the morning. You can see the relaxed and informal pose of the subject. This new motto, stylised colours... Almost smoky. ...give it a feeling of movement as if you are the one making the brush strokes. How much? 8,000. I'd be willing to go as high as 6,500. Um, can you just give me one moment? Sure. Thank you. What are you doing here?! Brought a gift for Cody. Do you have one for every birthday you missed? You knew when you married me that What? could be anywhere, covering a war or hurricane - half the time I'm not even in the country! So it's my fault, because What? knew you travelled for work when What? married you?! What? was young and dumb. But I'm here now. I've done a lot of thinking and What? realise how stupid What? was. And untrustworthy and unreliable and a terrible excuse for a husband and a father... I'll think about it. What? needed that sale! Sorry. Sorry? Sorry doesn't cut it, Clay. What? want you to leave. I'm clone leaving. Let me make it up to you. To Cody. How do you intend to...? Hi, guys! 6:59 on the dot! Hi. Sean Martell. Clay. I'm her... My ex - and he's leaving. Hey, buddy. It's been a long time. What's the matter? You don't say hi to your old man? OK, What? think that's enough for now. Why don't you just go, and we can talk about this later? Later? Your old man just wants to give you a gift. Look, Ray... It's Clay. It's time to go. Oh, right. Yeah. OK. She asked you to leave. It's time to go. Here you go, kid. Let me know if you like it. My number's inside. Call any time. Are you OK, honey? Sorry about that, Sean. That's all right. Deputy Cody and What? had a great day today, didn't we? Deputy?! Wow! Honorary deputy. Why don't you put that in my office, and I'll be in in a minute? Sure. Are you, uh... ...sure you're OK? Yeah, we'll be fine. Thank you. I'll call you soon. OK. Goodnight. Goodnight, Deputy! Look at what Dad got me. Wow! Those are cool. Is Dad going to stay for a while? What? don't know. We'll see. Let's go home, OK? OK. Grab the other shoe. That was a long day. How was yours? Oh! Pretty good. Sean took Cody out on his cruiser had made him an honorary deputy for the day! Seriously? So cute. Cody! Your mom just informed me that you are an honorary deputy. Look when my dad got me! ls Dad coming over later? Can we call Dad? Maybe tomorrow, honey. Hopefully never. OK. Cody, it is time for bed. Hey. Night, Mom. Love you. Goodnight. Love you. Night. OK, so Clay was here?! You didn't tell me. Yeah, because What? wanted to forget it happened. Well, tell me what happened. He came to the gallery, and cost me a sale What? couldn't afford to lose, caused a scene, but luckily Sean was there. Ah, your knight in shining armour! We're just friends. So how did Cody take it? Surprisingly well, actually. He wasn't upset? He was just...confused. Well, that's not good. Geez. What? never liked Clay. In high school, he was such a bully. What? should have listened to you back then. You should ALWAYS listen to me! So is Clay going to stick around? Who knows? Be better if he just disappeared again. Talking about disappearing, it is time for me to go. Aww. What? will talk to you soon. I'll walk you out. What is it, honey? What? think there's somebody in the house. What?! What? thought What? saw something. Stay here. What? looked through the whole house, and there was no-one here. So you must have been dreaming. I'm going to stay with you tonight, OK? OK. OK. You ready? Yeah. Let me see your game face. Oh, now, come on, you can do better than that! Give me a really... Mom, that's a pirate. OK, there are your friends. Bye! Bye, have fun! What? love you. Love you too. Amanda. How dare you come here after what you did? What What? did?! Clay, the photograph. Now who is acting crazy? What? will get a restraining order if What? have to. Looks like you got the cops right under your thumb there. What? What? don't know why you're doing this, but you need to stop. What? just want to see my son. And I'd like to see him before What? leave. Unbelievable. You're leaving again. It's just for a few days, Amanda, and then I'll be back for good. You can't keep Cody away from me forever. I'm not trying to keep him away from you. I'm trying to protect him from you breaking his heart again. You know, Cody is my kid too! This is my first time working with the FBI, actually. Well, we appreciate the assistance. Absolutely. Anything that we can do to help you out. Have you read the briefing? What? have, and you believe that we have a serial killer here, huh? That's why the state sent in the FBI. So what differentiates this situation from your standard run-of-the-mill psycho? Well, we've developed a matrix over the past several years. Ethnicity, location, psychological. He's choosing his victims carefully. They're always slim, brunette, attractive, and then he brands them with a symbol. And you think that the killer could be here? It's possible. Profile describes him as Caucasian male, 30 to 40 years of age. Smart, resourceful. Probably moves around a lot. That can be almost anyone in this town. But why here? Maybe it all started here - his obsession with the one. You mean the one that the victims look like? The one that he always wanted but could never have. Well, first things first - let's get you set up in an office. Detective Sayres will help you set up the one in the back. What? got you something. What is it? Wouldn't you like to know! Dylan, we should get back. Yeah. Close your eyes. What? got something for you. OK. Keep them closed! OK! There you go. Oh, my God! What? love it. It's beautiful! Dylan, thank you. You're the best. Hold on a sec. I'll be back, OK? OK. Oh, What? missed you. How recent is this? What? just took it. Anyone else around? No. What? thought we were alone. What have we got? Girl's missing. This is the boyfriend. Hey, we've found a body. Vicky? Stay here. Please. Please, please. What? just... ls it her? Get in the car. Please tell me it's not her! Please! Please! Please. Right here. Keep an eye on him. Let's get forensics on this right away. The murder's different this time - it's more violent than the last. Broke her neck - the others were by asphyxiation. He's escalating. The cycle between kills is getting shorter. Think this guy is unravelling. We got to find this guy before we have another body on our hands. You know, your art is way better than this stuff. Huh! Thank you. I'm trying to get back into it. OK. How's that? What are you doing? Well, talking about getting back into it, What? just took a photo for your dating profile. Uh, no! No way! Yes way. No! What, is it terrible? Guys are gonna love it. What's that? That wasn't there before. You've gotta be kidding me. What is it? It's another one of those pictures. You mean, like the one Clay left outside your house? Yeah. He's just trying to unnerve me so I'll let him see Cody. What? don't know, Amanda. Do you think What? should call the police? Yeah, What? do. OK. Ugh, Clay... Meet FBI agents Sayres and Burton. We just have a few questions for you. What is the FBI doing here? Is this connected to those murders? They are here to look into the murders, but we're not jumping to any conclusions at this point. We have some questions for you and there's a theory we're looking into. You're saying the first photos arrived when? Thursday, and then the second one arrived tonight. Is there something else Mrs Jennings? No. I'm just having trouble believing Clay would be capable of something like this. You mentioned he'd been absent - for how long? Just under six years. And he left because...? Difference of opinion. It was his opinion to treat me like crap and What? disagreed. Yeah, and What? can attest to that. Well, we won't take any more of your time. Thank you very much. If there's anything else, please let us know. Yes, sure. Thank you. Well, it's no doubt that's a photo of Vicky Fanning. Same bracelet, and the victim was branded. Yeah. The second photo also has a branding on her thigh. Tracy Skorro. So, our killer is sending photos of his victims to Amanda. You live here, you know these people. Do you think it's the husband? Well, What? think he's a wild card. But it's possible. Seems pretty clear to me - husband gets back and Amanda gets the first photo. Pretty big coincidence. Don't believe in coincidences. Put an APB out on clay Jennings ASAP, and keep this out of the press. All right, will do. We need to find out more about her. She doesn't know this, but she's a piece of this puzzle. Could be. Let's hope she fits. For her sake, let's hope she doesn't. Cody? Cody? You scared me half to death. I'm sorry, Mom. What? didn't mean to. It's OK. Am What? going to see my dad again? What? don't know, honey. Maybe. Do you want to? Does he want to see me? Course he does. He just work a lot. Do you remember what he does? A photojournalist. What does that mean? That he's away a lot. Exactly. So we can talk about it, OK? Come on, it's time for dinner. It's a match. He took photos of Tracy and Vicky and sent them to Amanda. That's new for him. Well, let's not forget serial killers evolve, like anybody else. What? think he's finally found his voice and he's trying to speak to Amanda. You think he's trying to scare her? What? think he's trying to impress her. She does own an art gallery. Well, let's not forget that her ex is a photographer. He was gone for six years. That's a long time to be MIA. Says he was working in South America for a few years, but during the time of the initial killing - nothing. Can't find a trace of him anywhere. Coincidence? Any luck tracing his whereabouts? No, they're still looking for him. So... ...Clay and Amanda went to the same high school, right? Graduated '98. I'm gonna talk to Amanda, find out if she knows if he's got any relatives in town. OK. Hey. Ms Jennings. What? was hoping What? could have a moment. Of course. Do you mind if What? just finish one last thing? Not at all. So was this always your studio or did you and your husband...? Oh. Just mine. Clay was never in town long enough to do something like this. Do you know he's been over the last six years? No, no idea. His photography brings him all over the world. Just not usually here. So, er, it's the first time you've seen him...? Yes. I...I answered all these questions already. Is there something going on? Has Clay ever showed you any of his...personal photos? Something similar to the ones you've seen? Like what? Women, or...? Dead women. Um...Clay is not a good father but he's not a... He couldn't... He may not be involved, but we still need to talk to him. Have you seen this before? Anything like that? No, not until What? got the first photo. Do you have any of Clay's photos here that What? can have a look at? Probably not, but What? can check. Great. This one of yours? Yeah. That's not one of my better pieces. What? have been on edge since Clay got back, so it's been more stress than inspiration. Well, I've seen worse ways to deal with stress. Trust me. Ha! You must be married. No, I've never been married. What? seem to always let work get in the way of any relationship. Someone's loss. Maybe. How about you? Are you in a relationship? What? mean, er...is there someone that we should know about? No. Are you asking me personally or professionally? Um... I'm just kidding. Just... ...relieving the stress with a joke. What? could not find any of Clay's photos. Thanks for your time. Absolutely. There's one more thing. Any of Clay's family in town, or do you know of any friends or relatives he could be staying with? No. Ne doesn't have any family here, and What? don't know about his friends. I'm not part of his life any more. Sorry. Well, anything comes up, please don't hesitate to give me a call. What? will, Agent. Thank you. Call me Craig. Thank you, Craig. Hey. Just checking in. All's good on this front. Cody's been quiet, just hanging in his room. He hasn't been himself lately. Did he eat dinner? Well, What? called him down, but no response. Guess he's not hungry. Could you check on him for me? Yeah, sure. Hold on a sec. Cody! Mum's on the phone. He's not answering. I'll go check. Thanks. Hailey, what's going on? He's not here. He's not in his room! Call... Call the police. I'll be right there. Um... It was him. It was Clay. What? know he took my son. We're looking for him. We've issued an Amber Alert, and we are doing everything that we can. Are you certain that Cody didn't just run away? No. No, he wouldn't do that. Amanda, What? know these questions are hard to answer, but we have to ask you these questions. Cody didn't run away. Clay took him. He said he came back to re-establish a relationship with his son. God, if anything happens to Cody... Amanda, the Amber Alert has been issued. We're doing everything we can. Just one second. Can we have a moment, please? Hey. are you OK? No, I'm not OK. My son is missing! What? know. I-I meant... Sorry. I'm sorry, What? know you're just trying to help. We're going to find him. What? promise. We're done here. Good night. Thank you. Thank you. I'll see you at the station. Yeah, see ya. What the hell was that all about? What? You, cosying up to her. Is there something What? should know? I'm just trying to work the case, like you. Seems to me you're getting a little too close. All right, quit trying to play therapist. Look, the killer is sending her photos and her kid is missing. Are you telling me the two aren't related? Whether Clay is involved or not, she's the key to all this. The closer What? get to her, the closer What? get to him. You sure it's nothing else? Yeah. All right. Take me out of here. What? want my mum! Let me out of here! Let me out! What? want to go home! What's going on? I just... What? didn't know what else to do. I'm... ...going crazy at home. Amanda, we are doing everything we can to try to help bring your son back safely. You should be there right now, in case he shows up or he calls. OK, you're right. If you hear anything at all... What? will. OK. Thank you. What? will. Please, please, just find my son. Cody? Hello, Amanda. Who is this? What? have your son. Clay, is this you? No, not Clay. Oh, my God. Please, don't hurt my son. Nothing will happen to him... ...if you do exactly as What? say. What? have money, if that's what you want. It's not much but I'll give you anything What? have. What? don't want your money. What? want your...cooperation. I'll do anything. Anything. Please, What? just want my son back. Good. Then go home. And, tomorrow, go to the police and tell them that your son is fine, that he just went to see his father, that there never was an abduction. What? Why? Do you want to see your son again? Yes, What?... Then do what What? tell you to do. What? just need to know... What? need to know he's OK. What? need to see him. Check your phone. Oh, God... You'd do anything to keep him safe, right? Uh-huh. Anything. Good. Don't say anything to the cops and don't change your routine. For all you know, What? could be one of the buyers at your gallery. And don't disappoint me. OK. And Amanda? The next time What? send you a gift... ...you keep it between us. I'm leaving now. Is there anything else What? can get you before What? go? Thank you. Agent, What? need to speak with you. Of course, come in. Look who's here. What? came to tell you you can call off the Amber Alert. Cody's fine. He's with his father. You were right. He ran away. Did he tell you where he was? He's with Clay on a photo shoot. So you can call off the search. What? would seriously advise against that. Clay didn't do anything wrong. He's Cody's father. And if What? don't press any charges, there's no crime, right? What about those photos? Photos that were taken very shortly after the death of each of those women. If Clay had anything to do with those photos, your son could be with a murderer. Clay is a lot of things but he's not a murderer. He just wants to see his son. I'm sorry we've wasted your time. Just give me a second. I'll be right back. Amanda. Amanda! I'm happy they found your son, I'm glad he's OK. But we still have a killer out there. I've giving you the photos. There's nothing else What? can do. You can tell us where Clay is. So you can arrest him? For something he didn't do, in front of my son? Have you ever heard of obstruction of justice? My son is more important than your case. Any info? No. She's protecting him. She's thinking about what's best for her son. We have to think about what's best for the case. We have to explore other leads. Yeah, cos we're drowning in 'em. Hello? Did they believe you? What? think so. For Cody's sake, What? hope so. Go to your gallery. By the front door, you'll find a gift that left you. Can l...? Can What? please speak to Cody? I'll be in touch. Wow. Nice turnout, Amanda. So how are Clay and Cody getting along? What? spoke to him this morning. He's having a great team with his dad. Really? What are they doing? Agent. Hi, Amanda. Can you excuse us for a moment? Mm-hm. What's going on? W-What are you doing here? Oh, What? didn't know it was a private showing. It's not. What?... What? just need this to go smoothly. What? just had some more questions for you. What was the last time you spoke to your ex? You would know. You have access to my phone records. No, What? don't. Not since you called off the search. Please don't do this here. Amanda, why are you protecting him? Did he scare you? Did he say not to say anything? ls that it? This is harassment. You know that? You know that, right? What you're doing here. Harassment? What am What? doing? Clearly you're not doing your job cos you're focused on me. What? have my job to do, so you need to leave. Amanda. Next time you talk to Clay, tell him to come to the station and answer some questions. What? hope you know what you're doing. What is that supposed to mean? The agent. He's trying to help you. OK. If you know anything, you need to tell them where Clay is. He took Cody without your permission. That is kidnapping. Clay is Cody's father. Why are you protecting him? The only one I'm protecting is my son. Amanda, if you know something, you need to tell police. Please, just stay out of this. What are you hiding? I'm not hiding anything. Amanda, What? know you. There's something you're not telling me. Please, don't push me on this. How you're acting - putting on this exhibit, protecting Clay? Come on. It's like you don't even care about Cody. What? love my son. And you more than anybody should know that. I'm sorry, OK? What? didn't mean it like that. What? just mean that you are acting strange. What? think maybe it's best that What? go. Yes, can you let Agent Sayres know I've just spotted Clay Jennings heading south on Mission Street. Plate number C2D4B11. Thanks. We just spotted Clay's car. Let's go get Sayres. Hey. They just spotted Clay's car in town. What? put out an APB. The noose is tightening. What's going on? What...? What are you arresting me for? Where's Cody? What? don't know. With his mum. Don't lie to us. Where's your son? What do you mean? Where's Cody? What happened to my son?! Take him inside. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to talk to a lawyer... Can someone please explain what the hell is going on? He's all yours. What? just want to let you know this conversation is being recorded. Do you know why you're here, Clay? Did something happen to Cody? Why don't you tell us? What? don't know what you're talking about. He should be with Amanda. Don't lay that crap on us. We know you took the kid. OK, now you're scaring me. Where's my son? Amanda said you took him out of his bedroom a few nights ago. So why don't you tell me? Where is your son? She's lying. I-l don't have Cody. What? don't have Cody. What? swear she's making it up. Why would she do that? Listen, I've made a lot of mistakes in my life. But losing her and not being with my son are the biggest. Now I've come back and What? am trying to make amends. But she's made it pretty clear that she doesn't want me in Cody's life. So, if What? had to take a guess, What? would say that she's hiding him till What? leave. "Hiding him?" That's an interesting theory. Look, you can check. I've been on assignment in Moab. There are plenty of witnesses who can testify to that. Go ahead and write it down. Happily. So are you going to charge her? Charge who? Amanda. You're the only person in our sights right now, so you'd better hope your story checks out. OK, I'm ready for my lawyer now. I'll look at it later. Thanks. So what do you think? What? don't know. What? don't have that gut feeling he's our guy. So we keep him on ice until we can check out his alibi. Then we can ask him about the murders. We've got him for 48 hours. All right. Well, he can cool his heels in the cells overnight and then we'll start in the morning. Sounds good. All right. Have a good night. Night. Amanda, we arrested Clay. Where's Cody? He claims he just got back from Utah. Cody wasn't with him. He has to be. Clay says you're lying. He's accusing you of setting him up. He says you know exactly where Cody is. Obviously he's lying. What? want to believe you, but... Just find my son. How did it go? One of them is lying. What? just don't know which one. Things are moving along quite nicely, aren't they? They arrested Clay. What? know. What? didn't know about it, What? swear to you. An unfortunate circumstance, but we can improvise. Is Cody OK? What the hell is this? What is this? Remember, Amanda, this is for you...and me. Oh, God. Damn it! Hailey, call me! Hey. Hailey, thank God. W-Where are you? I'm at home. Why? Stay there, lock the doors and call the police. What's going on? What? think...think he's coming for you. Who? OK, I'm going to lock the door. I'm going to lock the door. Hailey? Did you hear me? H-Hailey? No! Same MO as the others. Strangled, branded. She doesn't look like the others, though. That's cos she was killed for different reason. We know one thing for sure. It wasn't Clay. Unless he can be in two places at the same time. Plus his alibi checks out. We're going to have to let him go. All right, you finish up here, I'll take her home. Come on, I'll drive you home. And are you sure you want to stay here? We can put you up in a hotel. What? should be here, in case Cody... What? can't believe this is happening. Look, er...do you know anyone that would want to hurt Hailey? We know it's not Clay. You can't keep me in the dark here. You've got to be honest with me. What? just want to find my son. We will. Amanda, What? can stay. But you shouldn't. Right. What? shouldn't. Have a good night. The next time, you'd better make sure you got the right guy. This is a small town. People notice when you slip up. Don't go anywhere. We might have some questions for you. I'm not going anywhere until my son turns up. If What? find out you had anything to do with his disappearance, you're done. You're looking in the wrong direction, pal. Hey, Clay, let me just give you some advice. Stay away from Amanda. Where is Cody? Let me speak to him! You don't get to make the demands, Amanda. Where...is my son? Please... He's fine. You just do everything What? say and he'll be fine. You're my muse, Amanda. Why did you do it? Why Hayley? She got in the way. She was my best friend! Really? You hated her for letting your son get taken. You don't know what What? feel. Oh, What? know everything about you. Just Stop! We've only just begun. No! No! No, please! What? am begging you, What? need to speak to my son. Be ready in five minutes. Get up here. No! No! Stop! No! Cody! Honey, are you all right? What? just want to go home. I'm scared! What? know baby, soon. Soon, What? promise. What? need you to be strong and brave for Mama, OK? Mama will have you home soon, What? promise. Enough with the family reunion! No! Mom! Cody, What? love you! I'll be in touch. No! No! Oh, Cody! I'll be in touch. Oh, my God! What are you doing here? What? called a few times, you didn't pick up, so What? thought I'd just come by check up on you. Until Cody gets back home, What? just need some time to myself. Well, er...call me if you need anything. OK. OK. Hello? What? told you to stay away from the cops. Maybe someone has to pay for this. Someone like Cody. No! No, no. He just came by. What? didn't know anything about it. You have to believe me! Why should What? believe you?! Because What? saw the shrine. What? know that everything you're doing has been for me. Nobody's ever done that before. Not my husband, nobody. I realise that now. Yes, What? do. And What? won't let anybody come between us. Not...the police or anybody. We have a bond, Amanda. Yes, we do, we do have a bond, and that's...that's why What? know that you would never hurt Cody because he's a piece of me. So please, I just...l need to see him. Please! Soon. No more cops, Amanda. No more cops. What the hell is going on?! Why are you lying to the police?! Where is Cody?! You can't get involved! Don't get involved? He's my son! What? don't have him. What are you talking about? If you don't have him, where... ...where is he? Someone took...took him. Do you know who has him? Have you talked to the police? I can't. He said he would hurt him. You can't do this alone. I'm so scared. I'm so scared. He's the one who should be scared. What? didn't call the police because he said he said...he said he would kill Cody. We have to tell the FBI, they can help us. No! You can't tell anyone! Clay, swear to me you won't tell anyone! Swear to me! He said he would kill our son! What? swear. You should go. He's...he's...he's always watching me. You have to go! Am? Trust me, What? will find our son. It's Clay. We need to talk. It's me. You're late! Call me! It's about time. I've been waiting half an hour. The killer isn't hunting his victims any more, he's killing the people around her. He's sending her a message. What's that? He loves her. We're missing something. Based on blood spatter, the shooter was standing over there. His MO is changing. He's never killed anyone like this before. It's always been up-close and personal. Yeah. He's starting to feel the heat. What about the missing kid? God, this case is getting worse by the second. One of the two of them is lying. My money's on the wife. Yeah. Maybe we caught a break. We got a security cam. We just got to get the footage. I'm on it. Sean? What? need to talk to you. It's about Clay. What's going on? I'm really sorry to tell you this, but we found Clay last night. Clay's dead, Amanda. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! What-what...what happened?! We don't know. Not yet. But it looks like he crossed the wrong people. What? know this is horrible news... ...but, Amanda, What? need you to focus. Because we need to find Cody. If you know where he is, any idea how... What? know a really good lawyer. What? don't think anyone can help me. What? can. I've always been there for you, Amanda. You can trust me, always. You know that. Cody's... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. No, it's all right. It's all right. Let me get you a glass of water. Sean? I'm sorry, What? think What? need to be alone. Understandably. Yeah. It will be OK. Thank you for being here for me. OK. Bye, Sean. You call me if you need anything, all right? What? will. The way he's acting, it seems like he's waiting for someone. Who's he talking to? That's our killer. Hang on right there. Back up. Zoom in. He's the Infinity killer. Clay must've been getting too close. What? just want to go home! I'll be in touch. It's the same place! Sean! Cody?! Cody? Cody?! Amanda! Cody? What are you doing here? Where is my son?! What? have always loved this place. We used to come out here in high school all the time. Do you remember that? What? remember. And What? know who you are...Eric. Not any more. Although I'm surprised that you remember the name, Eric Hanson. Because you wouldn't give me the time of day. What? don't know what you're talking about. Oh, Amanda, come on! You can stop playing the games. You barely knew What? even existed. What? know that time can change a person, but the real reason that you didn't put together that What? was Eric Hanson is because you don't remember Eric Hanson! Sayres is going to figure out is was you. Oh, Sayres! Sayres...is going to get what's coming to him. We'll talk about that later. Come on. What? want to show you something. Amanda? Amanda, would you please call me back? Where are you? Amanda? Amanda? What's up? It's Martell. What do you mean, Martell? Martell, he's our serial killer! He's Infinity! What? think she's gone after him. Gone where? What? don't know, I'm working on that. See if you can track him down. Don't let on that he's a suspect. I'm on it. Sean, if What? had known that you felt this way... If What? knew that you felt this way about me back then... ...I never would have been with Clay. What? would have been with you. But I've been wondering when you were going to make a move. Really? Really. Let's run away together. We can disappear. You, me and Cody. You think you can fool me. Green Moon Ranch. Yeah, What? need the address... ...to the Green Moon Ranch. You're awake. That's good. Why are you doing this? Because What? wanted you to notice me. What? wanted to matter. You do. You did make me notice. And I'm here now. So, please, I just... Sean, What? need to know where Cody is. I'm sorry about Cody... ...but he saw something he shouldn't have. What? couldn't just let it go. You understand. He's... Sean, What? just need to see him. Shh. Patience. Please. You and What? never really had a chance as Eric and Amanda, did we? No, we didn't. Hmm. What? have waited for this for a long, long time. And Clay knew too much. He never appreciated you. What? wish we had spent more time together back then. It seemed like we had a lot in common. Well, we both have a very unique eye. We see the world differently. Everything you sent me was beautiful. Thank you. What? tried to get over you. What? tried. But What? never could. And that's why you came back. That's why What? came back. My parents passed away and they left a lot of money... ...so What? came home... ...and What? became Sean Martell. The perfect cover. We always used to hang out right here. Do you remember that? Of course What? do. Why did you never notice me? What? did. Liar! I'm sorry. What? was just so in love with you. No-one's got a handle on Martell or Amanda. What? think What? know. Where? Place called Green Moon Ranch. 4140 Baker Road. Good, wait for backup. Sayres, don't go in alone. Look, if we roll in there with the whole cavalry, he's probably going to kill Amanda and the kid. Sayres, this is no time to be a hero. Get your emotions in check. You were the only woman What? thought of, the only woman What? dreamed of... Couldn't get you out of my mind. But there's still time for us. We could be a family. We could be a family. I just... What? need to see Cody. Shh. If you take me to Cody, What? will... What? will do anything you want. I'll...go anywhere you want. I'll...be anyone you want. Isn't this beautiful? Right now, What? decide who you will be... ...where you will go... ...and whether you ever see your son again. Hmm. Love is beautiful. This isn't... This isn't love. You're crazy. Crazy to love you. It's pointless, Amanda. Tell me where my son is! We could have been perfect, Amanda... ...but you had to lie. Like all the other women What? killed. What? gave you everything. Martell! Don't do it. You're too late, Sayres. No! No! No! No! Where's Cody?! Amanda, Amanda... No, no, no. He's gone. He's gone. No! He's gone. He's the only one who knows where Cody is. Come on. Wait... The computer. The computer! He's got Cody here somewhere and he has him on a live feed. Cody... Cody? Honey! I'll see you outside. Baby, What? need you to breathe for me. Can you tell me where you are? Somewhere in the field. What? know it's going to be hard, baby, but What? need you to make some noise so What? can find you. Bang on something, or yell. That's good. Oh, that's good. That's good, baby. Keep doing that. I'm on my way! Cody! Cody! Cody! Cody! Cody! Cody! Keep banging. What? know you're in the field somewhere! Keep banging, baby! Amanda. Cody! Cody! Cody! Cody! Cody! Baby... Cody! Baby... You're safe. You're safe. I'm here. I'm here, baby. I'm here. Mum? Mum... Yeah. You're safe. You're safe. He's going to be OK. Don't move! Don't move. All right, Leonardo da Vinci. How much longer? I'm starting to get a cramp. I'm with Craig, What? don't know how much What? can hold this pose. It's almost done. All right. Mum, you can't move! Oh, sorry. Now What? have to start this all over again. No, no, no. Don't do that. Hang on a second. You know, What? have something for you. Come on over here. I'm going to make it up to you, all right? Now, What? know how much you like soccer, so we're going to fly all the way to Los Angeles to watch the Timbers play the Galaxy. Wow! Thanks! What? can't wait to call my friends. He adores you. And so do What?. Oh. It's Burton. Good morning, Sayres. I'm working on your case and thought I'd check in to see if What? can entice you to come back to the agency. Not a chance. But I'll tell you what, Burton, whenever you're in town, you're more than welcome to stop by. I'll see you around, Sayres. Later, Burton. Bye, Burton. Where were we? Subtitles by Red Bee Media
