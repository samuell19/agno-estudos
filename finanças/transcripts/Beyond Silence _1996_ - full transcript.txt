BEYOND SILENCE Come on! Come on! Great! Did you hurt yourself? It is thundering outside, Daddy. It's so loud. It goes BANG! BOOM! BAM! It's like all hell's been let loose. Yes, that must have been very loud. I can just imagine it. No, Daddy. That wasn't loud. Lightning is silent... like the moon. It's just the thunder that's noisy. It's terribly loud. Ahh, thunder? What would we do without you and your ears? Daddy, you sound like a fish blubbering through the water. You're slurping. The telephone is ringing. Good morning. Lara Bischoff speaking. Hello, Grandma. It's Grandma. Her roses are wilting. Mom says your apartment's too warm. You should put aspo...? Asporan? ... aspirin into the water. Are we coming for Christmas? Sure, we are. Yes. Grandma wants to talk to you. I think he's already left. I have to go to school. Mommy, come here! Okay, Grandma. Bye. Hello, Lilli. How are you? Fine, thanks. Good morning, Santa Claus. - Good morning. Daddy... you wanted to enlarge the poster for the school celebration. Good morning. - Good morning, Lara. I'm on my way. - Lara! How are you? Fine. - Does Martin know we won't get any Christmas money this year? - Is that bad? - Well... Will you tell him? - If it's bad, tell him yourself. I have to go to school. Bye. "Here, he thought... is where... Schatzhauser... lives. He took off... his..." Lara, that was your homework. Didn't you practice reading? Didn't you have time? Maybe she read it to her dad, and he thought it was great. There's no getting around it, Lara. Reading is important. If you don't work at home, you'll have to stay after school. Do you understand? Continue reading, Uli, but with feeling. With feeling? "And when he said that, he was surprised to see..." "He felt as if he had..." How much longer will that take? We have an appointment at the bank! Not now! We have reading now. That's important. Yes, learn to read properly! I'm very proud of you. What's wrong now, Mommy? I'll wait. What's wrong? Bea, what's so funny? Lara's mother is outside. What? Again? This is the last time! Next time I'll keep you waiting till you turn green. "Life's the best teacher, not school." Great! Just tell that to my teacher. No, sorry. I can't do anything till March 1st. They agreed to a 6 month period. The return is payable when it ends. Ask about the money we paid into the account. Can't he give us back any of it? We need money now! He can't, Daddy. Stop begging! Ask him! My father says thank you. He's satisfied with your business. I'm pleased. He says no. You didn't ask! Can I help your parents? - No, thank you. If I say it won't work, it won't. Shall we go? Thank you, Lara. - My parents are your customers, not me. Translate what I tell you! I did! - Would you like some candy? "... who spoke these words..." No, I don't hear anything yet. "He was... ... surprised... ... to see..." Yes, Daddy. Now I can hear it. It's nice music, Daddy. Leave it on. Okay, I'll keep on reading. "Behind the... thick... pine..." Yoohoo! Grandma! Grandpa! Here we are! Merry Christmas. I don't remember how she looks, but she smells like lilies of the valley and summer. Who? - Clarissa. When will they be here? Robert is probably about to explode. I really envy you. You speak that magic tongue as if it were a game. If I hadn't listened to that pighead, my hands might be able to fly, too. Will you help me set the table? Hello, Clarissa and Gregor. - Hi. - Merry Christmas, you two. How nice that you're here. - I only came for the goose. We're having roast goose, aren't we? - These belong in the living room. I thought they belonged in the attic. How has it been so far? - Peaceful, and I hope it stays that way. Sure. It's Christmas. - Exactly. Why are you so late? Merry Christmas, Dad. Merry Christmas. Martin. It's freezing outside! And I forgot my blanket in heaven. What do I see? Nothing but old people! Aren't there any... What do you call those little... Children! Aren't there any here? You naughty girl! I know who you are. You aren't Santa Claus. - What? If you say that you won't get any presents. Who am I? Uncle Gregor... No! Santa Claus! You good little girl. All of these things are... for you! Does it taste good? I didn't know what to buy. Take it. I know that you can use it. Who gave you that nice book? - Daddy. Lara, come here. - Okay, Grandma. We'll read it later. - Shall we play the piece from last year? What should I do? - You can collect the napkins. I thought we'd read the book. Wait till Clarissa's finished playing. Use your hands when you talk to me! Wonderful, you two. You see, we get along fine when we play. Do you talk to the baby sometimes? Sounds are very important for babies. Is that right, Grandma? - That's right. Don't you want to stay over? - Oh yes! Please! You'd need at least an hour- Come! - ... to drive home in this weather. Don't cheat! Here, this is for you. - What is it? My first one. I learned to play on it. Do you want it? Thank you, Clarissa. Look. You press your lower lip against your teeth. Hey, you're talented. Lara! Where are you? I have to go. - Stay a while. I'll drive you home tomorrow. - Oh yes. Ask her. - Clarissa wants me to stay a while. May I? She'll drive me home tomorrow. Okay? ... and whoever is happy, is king... It doesn't take much to be happy, and whoever is happy... Look. This is my favorite color. - Mommy never puts on make-up. When I was your age my hair was this short. Should I cut yours? - No. It would be pretty... Okay, okay! I won't do anything you don't want. You see... That was my haircut. - Is that Dad? Yes. That's us about 20 years ago. - Look at Grandma. You didn't like him? - Who do you mean? Martin? Did he say that? That's wrong. When we were young we were very close. And then? - You know your father. He can really be stubborn sometimes. Your grandma always took his side. He could do anything. On his 15th birthday he knocked all the cups and plates off the table. Just imagine. Everything broken. And Grandma didn't even bat an eyelid. He was always her favorite. I never had a chance. - But you never learned his language. Yes, I did. A bit. As kids we made up our own sign language. But the doctors said it was a mistake, that sign language apparently kept him from learning to speak. You look pretty in that dress. Well, what do you say? Shall I cut it off? Don't be afraid. I'll make you look beautiful. I told you to come this afternoon! What happened to you? Why are you crying? Now you look like her. That's what you wanted, right? We're stuck together. Let me go! Hey, Daddy! Let me go! Mommy, why can't you ride a bike? I have a bad sense of balance as a deaf person. I want you to learn how. Every real mother can ride a bike. When the baby's born... Promise? Hey you in there. Don't be afraid. Out here life isn't completely quiet. When you come, I'll be here. I'll play a song for you on my new clarinet. How often have I told you? The cellos are too high. - Mr. GÃ¤rtner! Not now! We're rehearsing! The flute players don't listen! - Frau Mertens sent me down. I play the clarinet. Can you read notes? - She can't even read books! Come over here. Some things take time. I haven't yet given up hope that you'll master the triangle by the next parents' evening. C... D... F... G. Wonderful. Now hold the last note. Great. Now from the beginning again. "Does Good Claus Do Fun Games..." I didn't want to learn poems. My homework? I don't have any. I'm not wasting time. Mrs. Mertens said I've gotten better. What are you doing? Give me back my clarinet! What? Music keeps me from learning? Nonsense! Learning isn't more important! You don't know what's important! You're deaf! You don't even know what music is! You're mean! You never cared about my schoolwork. Neither you nor Mommy did! You just don't want me to play the clarinet! I hate you! I'm going to lose her. Only if you make the same mistake your parents did. What do you mean? Accept her for what she is. She can hear, and we are deaf. She is my child. But she doesn't belong to you. Mommy! The baby! It'll take that long? I want to stay. I'll stay here with you till the baby comes. Yes, they make a sound. They sound like bells. The more wind there is, the louder they ring. Were you happy, too, when Clarissa was born? At first... and then? Didn't you ever play together when you were my age? Why? When Clarissa was nine or ten she gave her first concert in front of a large audience. Grandpa had invited lots of important people. I think it was his 50th birthday. Everyone was very excited on that day. Clarissa had to play several pieces on the clarinet. She had practiced them for a long time. Grandpa was very proud of his daughter. Robert, leave him alone! Mommy! From then on she never played again when I was in the room. And so I spent many evenings alone in my room. Lara! Lara! I have this from a friend who teaches at a high school. It may be a bit difficult, but try it. It's your first music with triplets. When you reach this point, count to yourself: 1, 2, 3... That fast? - No. As fast as you can. Since everything is in G major... So this is F sharp. 1, 2, 3... Next year we'll find you a private teacher. Should I talk to your parents about it? Not now. At the moment they're really busy with our baby. Going to Uli's birthday? Why not? - He didn't invite me. Don't be sad, Lara. "Ravens fly in swarms, but the eagle flies alone." Don't whine! We have to do this. You want to look pretty, don't you? Hey, Mommy! Don't! Don't, Mommy! I wanted to read her a story. I'm supposed to talk to her a lot. Oh yeah? How do you know she's tired? Did she tell you that? Okay. Marie? Can you hear that? Hey, you can hear! She can hear! Marie can hear! But why are you suffering? No, everything is different. I'm not like I used to be. But there's one thing you have to know, Maria. You love me! You know you love me! - Yes, yes. Look at me, Maria. We have our whole lives ahead of us. You and me. Nothing else can come between us. From now on we'll always stay together. Yes. A bike ride? But you don't know how, Mommy! Except for the triangle, it was all very nice. - I'm not so good at music! You don't say! Can the trumpet player please remove his chewing gum...? It's nice you've come. Lara is a wonderful pupil, you see, but she won't pass, unless she improves her reading and writing. My reading is improving, but it isn't perfect yet. And we can't always allow her to leave class early. Tell her we're happy that she lets you leave class early sometimes. Are you finished yet? It's difficult to find a good translator here. It's summer vacation soon. Then I won't have to leave early. That's my last word on the matter! Next time I won't let you go. You're a wonderful teacher. Lara really likes you. She says you're quite nice. They're pretty. Thank you. - At last! I finally get to meet you! Your daughter is extremely talented. For the parents' evening I've reserved two seats for you in the first row, okay? This is my music teacher. He says it's a shame that you never allow me to play the clarinet. We have to pick up our baby. Any more questions? Lara, you told them how worried I am? I told them everything, not word for word, but more or less. The easiest note is G. No fingers... look! But I never get to play it. Maybe it's too simple for them to use. I did math on the bus. There's a story I have to read, but I can do it tomorrow. Are you coming tomorrow? Of course, the baby. "The sun resounds in age-old fashion, in brotherly spheres of rival calls, completing its appointed action by rendering up its thundersqualls. The sight of it gives angels strength, though its wisdom is never proclaimed. These works of baffling magnificence dazzle as if they'd just been made." It's your turn. Is everything okay? You'll do a good job. You'll play very, very well. And now Lara Bischoff from Class 3c. She'll play a piece on the clarinet. It's absolutely the best school. Students come from all over the world. What do you think? It's a question of Lara's future. You want to take away my only talented student? That's not very funny. She has to develop her talent, and you can't become anything here. That's right. - I'm not so sure... Berlin? I'd have to rent a room. That's too expensive. - There are other ways. You think Dad would take your money? - It isn't for him. It's for you! I could write a recommendation. - Music isn't that important to me. If you don't accept that offer, you'll be missing your big chance. You can't look after your parents your whole life! You show up once a year, and every time you have a new idea! Sometimes I think you're just bored. - Exactly. My final offer is, spend the summer with us and we'll practice every day. All summer long we'll practice and go to concerts and see if you can pass the entrance exam. Would you like to? May I come along? - You know I'd like to. You can't imagine how boring it is all day with your uncle. Look! What about Marie? Can't she make calls for you? Okay, I'll be right there. I got something to drink with some girlfriends. Sure, I'll bring them along sometime. I have to make some calls for Mom. You see this beautiful night? Take a good look. Things change quickly. Spring will begin soon. The snow will melt. How does snow sound? What does it say to you? It says... "Crunch, crunch... brr, brr." What are "crunch" and "brr?" What kinds of words are they? To tell the truth, snow doesn't say much. It's even said that snow swallows every sound. When snow is on the ground everything is much quieter. Honest? Snow makes the world quiet? That's beautiful. Clarissa was at school today. I didn't know she was here myself. It's her birthday soon. Grandpa wants to take us all to dinner. Won't you come with us, please? For my sake. Hey, you pig! - It's only chocolate. Before dinner? - Bettina treated me. Bettina's sleeping over. Her parents aren't home. Can we use your clarinet? By no means! - Why not? Afraid I'll break it? Have you set the table yet? - Let me just show Bettina! Please! Stop it! You won't get it! If you're bored, you can help Mom in the kitchen. - I don't want your stupid stick! Your music gets on everybody's nerves anyway! Do you hear that? It goes on all day. I'm really sick of that racket! Come on! Come on, do it! Ouch, Mommy! Ouch! Help! Nothing. Louder! Come on, hurry up! Ouch! Mommy! Help! Marie, did you hurt yourself? What's the big idea? Bettina thought that maybe our parents aren't deaf. Maybe they're spies who were sent here to observe us. We just tested Mommy. Are you nuts? Aren't you ashamed? - What for? She thinks it's funny. She made up crazy stuff when she was little too. She didn't mind, but you always get worked up! Go blow your stupid clarinet! - Be happy you have ears to hear it! Daddy can't hear, but he hates your music anyway! I can move out if it bothers you. I'd like to see your face then. How's your work with children going? I think I'll stop teaching. - But that Keller girl really improved with you. - Her family moved to Frankfurt a month ago. The others aren't really interested. That's boring. - What do you think about it, Gregor? Me? Yes, of course she's talented. The kids are crazy about her, but if she doesn't want to... Don't let the pleasure principle run your life! You must do something, besides spending your husband's money! - That isn't fair! I've always earned my living. - Sure, but how? Sorry I disappointed you, Dad. - Money's not the subject here. Stop all the arguing, will you! After all, it's Clarissa's birthday. - "After all, it's Christmas!" It's not my fault we only see each other on holidays! Do we always have to discuss the same things? What else should we discuss? - "Discuss?" I call it "put down!" We went through this before. If you had kids or a family... What do you do all day? She cleans up. - Exactly. - You clean up, huh? She'll have enough to do when Lara comes for the summer. Marie! - What? Lara is staying with you? - You haven't told them yet? Sorry. I thought you'd discussed it. - What are you talking about anyway? Don't keep us in suspense! What hasn't Lara told us? Let me tell... - You're afraid to. Lara is spending the summer with me. I'm preparing her for the entrance exam. If all goes well, she'll go to the conservatory in the fall. - Berlin? Isn't there anything nearby? It's a good idea. Lara's talent should be developed. Perhaps she'll make something of herself. But Berlin is far away. You'd have to live there. You want to move out? - Lara is 18. There's a time for everyone. It won't work if Martin and Kai don't approve. Do you have to stab me in the back? - Stab you in the back? I'm happy I can say anything in this family! Leave her alone. She's a wonderful clarinet player. I want to help her. We'll pay for it. Don't worry. - She has to get out of that nest. She's looked after you long enough! - Stop it, Clarissa! - Why? That school is just right for her. And you can visit her if you like. But we wanted to go to Italy this summer. - This is more important. Martin and Kai have to approve. Lara shouldn't be handicapped, just because her parents are! I'm the father! She is my daughter! Sit down! Clarissa, you went too far this time! - Sure, it's all my fault again. He throws red wine in my face, and you stand up for him! Damn it! I wanted to tell you this evening, but Clarissa told you first. Nothing is decided yet. Clarissa wants me to apply for the exam. That's all! She only wants to help me. She isn't conceited. That's nonsense! Do you think you and Mom can get along without me? I treat you like a baby. I can leave if I want to. Then what's the reason? I ruined their evening again. They felt ashamed for me... as always. Who cares? It isn't important. Why Clarissa of all people? Don't you know how much it hurts me? I want to become a musician. That's all. Try to understand me. Sometimes I wish you were deaf. Then you'd be totally in my world. It's mean that you're leaving. Now I have to translate all of Mom's romantic movies. - Stop whining! You don't help out much anyway. Can I at least sleep in your bed while you're gone? If it makes you happy. Yes, it does. And don't touch my Teddy Bear. Why do parents only talk about homework? When I was little I believed that all grown-ups could sing. I also thought I'd be able to, when I was a grown-up. I'd stand in front of a mirror and move my mouth and pretend that wonderful sounds were coming out, sounds that made people look so ecstatic, so happy... Music! I danced in front of the mirror, with a brush I used as a microphone. What's this, Mom? You don't know if I'll like this music. It's a clarinet concert. You read about it in the newspaper. I'm sure it will be very good. But why two tickets? Yes, we'll have a nice evening. It's wonderful you're coming along. Thank you. It's nice you're here. - Why didn't Clarissa come? She isn't feeling well this morning. - Oh! Nothing serious. She perks up after dark. Do you know what time it is? - Lara! You're here at last. Get up! I want to see the town. - You want to see the town? Now that you've dragged me here I want to see the town. Do you know how big this town is? Hello, Clarissa. - Hello. This is my niece, Lara. Christian, Frederick, Wolfgang, Anna, Babs, Susanne and Walter. Hello. - Are you visiting Berlin? She wants to go to the conservatory, but she must get used to the city. You're a musician? - Not yet. - She plays the clarinet very well. And now you want to see Berlin? Lara, come here! This is my lake. - Right in the middle of town! It's the only place that makes me melancholic. It always reminds me of home. It froze over last winter. What if somebody comes? Well? I don't like melancholy stuff. It ruins my mood for the rest of the day. Don't worry. I'll find you some nice pieces. I don't know if I want to play anything else. I like the music. But you won't get accepted with that? - Who says? - I do. Or do you plan to depress the examiners to death? I think they should accept you. That's ridiculous. The greatest composers... Either believe me, or try it alone! A stupid feeling being stared at, huh? I've been watching you. I noticed. Hello, I'm Johanna. Who are you? L... a... r... a. T... o... m. We're off to the park, but he let me take a quick look in here. Right! And "quick" is almost over. Can I help you? - We'd like those gloves. Aren't you deaf? Not me... You? How much? - 5 marks. What do you want? My father's deaf. He raised me all by himself. And now I'm a teacher at a school for the Deaf. We were actually supposed to work on articulation today. And you? And you? How come your sign language is so good? Careful, it's slippy here. I'm taking Johanna home. Are you coming? - Okay. In two months I'll be gone anyway. I'm going to the Gallaudet School in Washington for a semester. The Deaf can study medicine, art history, law... all in sign language. Americans recognize it as a language. They're at least 20 years ahead of us. I always wanted a father I could be proud of, one who protected me from the world and sang me to sleep at night. One who can't understand why you like "Guns 'n Roses" better than Beethoven. - Exactly. 6:30... I have to go. - 6:30! That's very late! You can come visit me at school. I'm there every day. Perhaps. I thought I'd visit you. This is Lara. She's come for a visit. She may become a teacher, too. Lie down! What should I do? Lie down on your stomach. Or don't you want to take part? Okay. Wait and close your eyes. Poor Lara. I'm afraid she can't feel the music. Will you go to the movies with me tomorrow? AT THE LAKE! COME AND JOIN ME. Lara, come on in! The water is wonderful. I don't have a bathing suit. - So what! You old bore! Come on in! Come on! Aren't you afraid in the middle of the night! I'll race you to the buoy. Where did Gregor drive off to? He's looking for an apartment. He said he gets a toothache from my music. They're all against us. - Everyone of them. Why didn't you and Gregor have a baby? I don't know whose fault it was. It never worked out. Maybe Mother Nature didn't want to entrust a baby to a mother like me. I did everything wrong. Martin has you, Kai, Marie and a real home. I have nothing. That's not true. You have so much. You're pretty and strong, and you make wonderful music. I always wanted to be like you. It was a nice movie, wasn't it? Didn't you like it? - Movies like that make me sad. Love stories with a happy end make you sad? - Yeah. They make me unhappy with what I have. I mean, they make you so hopeful. "Hope" is a widespread evil. You must be careful with your dreams. Most of them never come true. Why so serious? You're not even 20 and talk like Mrs. Kowalschek. - Who? My caretaker. She's 70, fat and ugly and sits all day with her poodle. Is there anything nice in your life? - Very little. You're making me crazy, you ungrateful creature! Don't feel so sorry for yourself! But I'm hungry. I want a schnitzel! - What? A schnitzel! Two schnitzels, please. I don't have any money. - It's on me. Would you like ketchup on it? - No, thank you. Gloria Gaynor! I loved this when I was 14. Come here. Come closer. Your mother had an accident on her bike yesterday. She's dead. There's no sound, Dad. It's soundless. It was a mistake for her to ride a bike. She had problems with her sense of balance. Are you trying to say it's my fault? Look at me! Talk to me! Damn it! You don't believe that! What should I do? The music bothers you. You don't want music lovers here? In your house? I'm sure to be home by 11, if the bus is on time. Okay? Do you have to go? - Yes. I haven't been out for months. And I'm about to go crazy. Anyway, the tickets are from Mom. Why can't I go with you? You have two. Someone has to stay with Dad. You have to put him to bed. He can put himself to bed. I'm not his babysitter. Watch it, Miss. Don't get cheeky! How do I look? - Too flashy. Really? Clarissa uses make-up, too. - Clarissa is good-looking. I love you. You know that, don't you? Giora, come on! Hurry! The concert is about to start. Tom? What are you doing here? You rode past me on the bus. I wanted to see how you're doing. Your aunt told me that... I'm flying tomorrow evening. I'm very sorry... I just heard a wonderful concert. I have to get into that school. I just have to. Do you think I'm good enough? I've never heard you play. - Shall I play for you now? Now? - Why not? There must be some advantage in having deaf fathers. Well, you're in a good mood again. - But my sister hears everything. Don't you need a light for the notes? - I have everything in my head. Don't judge me too harshly. I just made this piece up. Did you know that bees are deaf? Really, Mr. Teacher? They perceive sounds with their sense of touch. Now it can hear your heartbeat. Can't I stay in your apartment? I have to prepare myself for the exam. I want to leave here. - I've rented it to a friend. I can't let him down. Hey... What's wrong with you? Little Lara, why are you so terribly sad? The saddest things in life are separations and deaths. I don't want to say goodbye anymore. I've had enough of that. You aren't rid of me yet. Our story's just beginning. What a great couple, a clarinet player and a teacher for the Deaf. I don't want you to go. I'm almost back already. Where were you? - I was out walking. Aren't you a bit late? - What? It's only 7:15. Was the concert nice? Yeah... Around 12, I think. So what? I wasn't home by 11. But I'm 18, and I can be an hour late if I want! You're allowed to do some things, but not everything... Hey, what's up? But he won't allow you to bring men home, into the living room... Who was here? What did I do wrong this time, Dad? Why are you mad at me? Because I'm irresponsible, egoistic, and only think of myself and my music? And stabbed you and Mom in the back? And am on Clarissa's side? Let me tell you something! I can't stand it here! Your silent, reproachful looks, your complaints! The silence here, the noise you make when you read the paper, when you eat or brush your teeth! This house is like a cage! Get out of here! I've had enough! Yes? I'm looking for my aunt, Clarissa Bischoff. Is she here? What are you doing here? Come in. Walter is a photographer. He's taking photos in Spain for a travel magazine. He said I could help him. As his assistant, so to speak. We're leaving next week. - And Gregor? Your uncle has chosen to live alone. You did the right thing. Your music is more important. Martin will understand. That's typical of him. He goes crazy, and we feel guilty. You have no idea! What's wrong now? - You have no right to condemn him. You never tried to understand him. - Lara, I want you to be free... What do you really want from me? Sometimes I think you want me to study at that school for your sake. Nonsense! I want you to be good, really good. Your private problems only distract you from your music. - Sure. You want me to be good, but not better than you. That isn't fair. That's why you oppose my music. You think it's boring, depressing. If you were really interested, you'd have encouraged me. You never did. - Slow down, ladies. No need to get excited. - Shut up! You have no idea what we're talking about! Coffee? Just like your father! Now I see what you're really like! - Exactly! I'm my father's child and not the daughter you never had! And most of all, I'm not you! My publishing company is over there. You can sleep here. Sleep tight. My deadline is next month. The publisher is impatient. I'll only practice when you're gone. - Practice whenever you want. After 12 years with your aunt, I can sleep no matter how noisy it is. Do you regret having moved out? Not really... But maybe I will. Why did you leave? Clarissa has no need for me. Her mind is filled with you, Robert and Martin. - But they always argue. Yet, I wish she had loved me as much. Her health food got on my nerves, too! Everything's green in her fridge! I don't eat anything green, except chewing gum. Yes? Marie! Where are you? - Very near. Downtown... Can you pick me up? I don't know what subway to take? - Are you alone? Yes! My goodness! Are you out of your mind? Alone by train? And why are you here? To visit you. - That's why you came 300 miles by train? But I've no time. Does Dad know you're here? - Sure, I wrote him a note. What did you write? - That I was going to a party after school, but I didn't write that the party was 300 miles away. What does he say? - About what? You know... Does he talk about me? I didn't think what you said was so nice either. - Oh, shut up! You don't have to tell me that, too! Can't you come back soon, please? The exam is in four days. How shall I get home? - You didn't buy a return ticket? I used up all my money. And it's gonna be night soon. And I'm only nine. Oh, shit! There's a problem sleeping here. Come here, and you'll see. We need your help. Yes, a family affair. I filled the tank yesterday. - Okay. Are you alright? Sure. It goes 140 mph? - But drive carefully! See you tomorrow. - Okay. Take care, Marie. Say hi to Martin. Other fathers are proud of their daughters' success. Why don't you help me? You can't let me go in there alone. Daddy will tear me apart. I drove you here. Now you walk the last 10 yards yourself. - Please! Go on. He'll be happy you're back. I drove Marie home. Thank you. Hey! Since when does Clarissa know our language? Is Lara still at your place? Is she alright? No, she's sad... She misses you. Come on! I'll take you to her. Why didn't she come with you? She doesn't have the time. You have to go to her. Oh yes! We'll all go right back there together! No, I can't. Stop feeling sorry for yourself! It must be a family problem. Oh, Daddy! Why didn't you go there with her? If you ever run away again I'll spank the living daylights out of you! "Entrance exams." Which instrument? - Clarinet. Good luck. - Thank you. Lara Bischoff. Come with me, please. Miss Bischoff... In your application you wrote that you're interested in traditional klezmer music. Why are you interested in it? - It's hard to say. It's a feeling... Perhaps because it's so emotional. - Emotional? Well, well... Inside it's joyful and wild, and at the same time it's sad and not really free. It's a feeling I understand very well. Do you know what I mean? Then let's begin with your main subject. Miss Bischoff. You've brought along three pieces? - Yes. If you don't mind, I'll begin with the contemporary piece. - As you wish. The order is unimportant. I want to see you play. Is that okay? We're waiting. Don't you feel well? Would you like some water? - Take a deep breath. Then begin. It's not as bad as you think. Calm down. I just want to wish you luck. What's going on? Why did you come? To see what's so important to you and to see how you play. Excuse me, can you let us in on this? - Yes. That's my father. He's deaf. He'd like to watch. Alright, if he'd like to. But I must ask you to begin. That's right! Show them! Please, Dad. Stop talking. I'm getting all mixed up. So that's your music? Yes, it's my music. Do you think you'll ever be able to understand it? Maybe I can't hear it, but I'll try to "understand" it. Have I lost you? I've loved you ever since I was born. You'll never lose me. Thank you for coming.
