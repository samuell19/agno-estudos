He saved the guy who threw the Skrulloknak. Something tells me that this is not exactly Kreeknél common practice. When not wearing your boss if you do not own me. - Ronan. - The accusers performed the task. But the important mission failed. Because of you. - Say you had success? - So our agents lured the verse in Torfaen. - To kidnap. - Add your situation. - take care of the terrorists. - So that szétbombázzátok them? No. We'll solve it. A Skrull team anywhere in the world, a threat everywhere. Where are they? Currently, we do not know. We do not know. For now. - But we find them. - So be it. Or we will.

If összetudnánk together what happened that morning. Perhaps, they win all understanding. You woke me up. You burst into me at dawn. Habitually. At that time we still had to get up early. The Air Force did not allow women to go to missions. So that we tested roncsderbiken absence of any other activity. You wanted to compete to base, your old Musztángoddal, of course I did not mind. I knew it was pressed under the Camarommal. But you cheated. And cut off the road. - Since the slaughter fraud? - Since then, it goes against the rules. - They did not protect. - Hmm. This did not surprise me. When I got to the border, Lawson was pretty nervous. He said somebody lives are in danger. - He wanted to fly, but you said ... - If someone is in danger, then I'm flying. Yes. Amen. You finally caught the muffle. Both. Okay, you can always bro ... That is why we fought. Now you think that you come from another planet? I can not imagine how hard it was for you. All things related to you. And now... So, that was hard, I lost my best friend. A mission that is as if it never happened. I believed you. Because I knew, no matter where you are, or too stubborn to die. And after that once you set only after six years, super strong blaster hand.

I do not even know that different, than the others. I have a voice Pegazusos. Your song voice. A crashed machine. Six years ago. He says recordings that allegedly call a black box. They were told it was destroyed in the accident. How did you get it? Still do not understand? Cutie still know a few tricks, which you can get, In places where you should not. If you ever call Aranyoskámnak, get drunk in a place where you should not. Now you should find that any part of the body? The ass. Okay clear, everyone is a little tense. But just listen to please. To decode some coordinates. If you sit down and listen? I assure you that you will not regret. Call your buddy and I listen. Okay. Where they picked? Get out of here. How did this come in? The cat? You say that's not what you fear. This is not kittens. But a Felker. Ha ha. A Flerken. - Monica. - Why did not I listen? - What are we waiting? - To open. Punch in the coordinates. 5229 negative 47th - 8 768 0 throughout the whole 2 - I. - Where are we going, Doc? - In my lab. - The lab? What do you mean. - Oh no. The one... I mean, what is it? I do not see it on the radar. Carol pressure, gas him. - What is that Lawson? What the hell is this? - The bad boys. Let's get into it. - Switch. - Yes. - What do they want? - Me. In my plans. Too bad that I brought with me. the rocket is coming. Backwards firing. Hold on. Catapult. Catapult. Catapult. Lawson perseverance. - Carol hear? - Yes, I can hear you. - We crash. - Carol Are you all right? - Can you hear? - Yes, I can hear you. - Doc, the blood ... - Blue, I know. But what kind of hair?

Lawson is not my real name. In fact, they call MARVEL And I was not born on earth, but the fish-n. I would say delirious. But, now she fired off a spaceship. And blue, blue blood. Listen for a long time fought a shameful war. Get out, for you at least do not have remorse. Just do not forget the coordinates. - Without need to save them. - Who? How? For now, this should blow just before you find. Relax do not want to hurt you. No? But I was beginning to believe the former lövöldözésből. The nuclear energy? Where is? rescue teams are coming. Two minutes later they surround you. In this case, there is no reason to drag this conversation. Do not wait. The nuclear energy? Born. Commander. Even moving. - Permission to shoot. - Leave it do not shoot. There was nothing left. It destroyed the core. Comprising infiltrating the force. transferred to us. Yon-Rogg lied. All I knew was a lie. - Now, you understand now. - What? What do you understand now? Yon-Rogg Marvel killed. He killed. MARVEL because he realized that waging unjust wars. - And it is on the wrong side. - No. Ye are all terrorists. murder innocent. I saw the ruins of Torf. The ruins of Torf devastation caused by the accusers. The people lived as refugees in Torf. Homeless, we rebelled against the Kree. And they decided to ruin our planet. And the handful of survivors, felkoncolják soon. Unless you finish what you started MARVEL. The seed, he came up with the speed of light would be thrown us a new homeland by boat. Where the Kreeka not reach the hands. Lawson has always said that our work does not help to fight wars. It's closed. He wanted to help us. Find the lab. - But I already blew up. - Just blew up a gear. the fuel itself is in a remote location. If you help decode the coordinates. Finding. - captured him destroy us. - Only yearn for home. You have to. There was everything to us, because of the Kree. You still do not understand? You're not one of them. You do not know me. You have no idea who I am. I myself do not even know who I am. But Carol Denvers are. The woman, who is in the photograph, risked his life for a good cause. My best friend. Who supported a mother. And as a pilot when no one else. You're clever. Funny. Baromira and annoying. Even then, people did not know is stronger than you. Even when your hand is not struck by the flames. Do you hear. Do you hear what I'm saying. - Come here. - Come here. I know I do not deserve your trust. But there was no other hope. We have seen that just as the energy emanating from you as MARVEL seeds. It just found out why. I wish I knew how important this is to me. I do not want anything from you just to decrypt me MARVEL lab coordinates. Those coordinates are not. But state vectors. They give the position of the space. They have not found on the floor of the lab because it is not here. We know where we were on the day of the crash. If you calculate the trajectory we find in space, now. It's just simple physics. In space. - It would have been so hard to figure out? - You are a child of an engineer, right? Yon-Rogg gets here soon. We must find the seed still in front. Hm. Direction in space? Because? I should just change a few things on your machine. Happy to have you tinkering. Ha, ha. The engineer child. - I could use a copilot. - No. No, I can not. I can not leave him here. Mom, Grandma go ahead and take care of me. THE. No way to go, baby. Too dangerous. Brand new space planes get tested. Yet you do. If you are planning to step out of the atmosphere is not one designed for typing. Meanwhile, a technologically advanced enemy forces could attack at any time. Am I right? I'm talking about this. Go with it. Good. Monica. Legkirályibb world can participate in the mission. But you'd rather stay here to look me in California came to me. - My? No times have not stopped thinking about it, that you show an example of how this daughter. - What is this conspiracy? - I'm sorry. Inside, I'll tell you. Thanks for coming. Great mom lucky.
