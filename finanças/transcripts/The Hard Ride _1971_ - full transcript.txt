Well, I'll see ya around. Good luck.Thanks, Sergeant. We'll talk about arrangements on the way to the mortuary. I left my car over at the mortuary. As soon as we take Lenny there, I thought maybe you'd like to ride to the orphanage with me to see where he spent his younger years. Yeah, Lenny talked about the orphanage all the time. He used to call me "Big Tom." What about the funeral? Have you set any time, or-- I thought I'd discuss that with you, since Lenny did name both of us as next of kin. Well, I'd like to get home as soon as I can. Anytime you say, is fine with me. I'll make arrangements as soon as possible. Oh, I almost forgot. This letter to you was in Lenny's personal effects. "Dear Phil"--Thanks. "I hope you never get to read this, "but if you do, then you've met Big Tom, and you're probably gettin' ready to put me under the sod. "I've left my insurance to you and the orphanage. "I hope your five grand will give you time just to knock around for a while. "Maybe you'll fall in love with 'baby' "and ride with Big Red and the guys. "That would be groovy. "Big Tom will tell you about her. "There's just one thing I have to ask you, Phil. "Remember how I used to talk about riding with Red and the guys? "Well, aside from Tom and yourself, they're the only family I've ever had, "So I'd sure like 'em "to be at the funeral. "Get in touch with Sheryl-- She works at Mom's restaurant. "She'll help you find 'em, "and if for any reason, you decide you don't want "Baby, "give her to Red and he'll take good care of her. "That's about it, buddy. "And maybe if there's a place "in heaven where marines go, "I'll see you there." "But I hope it's not for 100 years. "Your pal, Lenny." [gun fire and explosions] Lenny!

I need the time to locate some friends of his. We can postpone it for that long, Father, if that'll help. It'll help a lot.Fine. ♪♪ They're gonna keep him for one week. Then, I'd like to go on with the funeral. Now, it's time to get you acquainted with "Baby." The garage is just outside of town. So that's "Baby." That's her. I asked Ted to tune her up. Looks like he's even cleaning her for you. Hello, Father.Ted, this is Phil. Well, I'm sure glad to know you, Phil.How do you do? Father, this bike runs like a striped... Monkey. Anyway, I was gonna clean off the road dirt off the under-carriage. Lenny use to shine her up after every run. I'm afraid I haven't been that diligent. Are you telling me you ride this bike? Every Sunday after mass. I have many hours of hard work on this little lady. She use to be a hobby of mine. So that's how Lenny got hung up on bikes. Yeah, I'm afraid you're right. There's many times I've regretted it. Instead of Lenny making it a hobby, it became a way of life. I don't suppose you've ridden a chopper before? No, nothing like this. My brother had a dirt bike. I used to be pretty good on it. Well, "Baby's" much heavier than any dirt bike, and she has twice as much boot. Oh, and this front end will take a lot of getting use to. Makes her real squirrely. Yeah, I can see where it would. She has a very wide turning radius. You'll have to watch yourself. Oh, I have a-an appointment in town in about 20 minutes. Ted, you fill him in on anything else he needs to know. Oh, sure, father. And when you find the boys, will you give me a call? Oh, you wanted to know about Sheryl. She works at Mom's restaurant. When you get into town, you go right straight through. It's about a half mile. You can't miss it-- It's right on the highway. Thank you, Father. Oh, and I have your duffel bag-- Uh, you may want some clothes. If you could take care of it, I'll pick up some civvies in town. Will do. [Ted] So, you were with Lenny, huh? He's one of the only ones I ever took to, if you know what I mean. Well, Phil, she's all yours. Let's see-- what do you need to know.
