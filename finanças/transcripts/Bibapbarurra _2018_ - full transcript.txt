Sir? -Yes? -Sir? Here's your prescription. You forgot to take it. What's up? Bored again? I told you, I can't today. Of course, I ate. Stop eating ramyeon and order in real food. Of course. I got to go. Bye. Son! Are you ready? I can't go to kindergarten today. What are you talking about? I don't want to go. Park Do-won! You're asking for it today. -Grandpa! -Don't call him! Ready for your first day of kindergarten? He says he's not going. What? Good morning, Dad. Good morning. Have fun at kindergarten today. Grandpa, I don't want to go. Do you want to have fun with me instead? Yes! -Come on, Dad. -Then, let's go. I have to go to the dentist today. Let's go together and get your teeth pulled out and treated. Yes, Do-won. Go with him and see the dentist. Good, Father. Then I'll call the kindergarten and tell them he'll go to the dentist today. -Hello? Is it the kindergarten? -Wait! Do-won! -Take care, Dad. -Have a great day. Wait! Could you sign for a package delivery today? -Be careful driving. -Sure! JEIL BARBERSHOP HEY, pal. Where's your grandson? -He went to kindergarten. -Too bad. -Have the rest. -No, thanks! Your job of watching Do-won is gone now. -Poor you! -Stop it! How will you get an allowance now? I didn't get that for watching Do-won. Keep this Saturday free. We have a blind date. -Again? Gosh. -Yes. Look. Soon-ho's here. -Hey. -Hey. Let's meet on Saturday. You want meat today? Wear your hearing aid! Okay! Hearing aid! Forget it. He never listens. By the way, there are grannies left to meet? The world is full of women. Then why don't you have one? Shut up and go do the laundry. Make yourself useful at home. My kids love living with me. Stop talking nonsense. Did you have fun at kindergarten? A girl named Yu-mi kept crying, so I told her not to. Then she suddenly stopped. She must like you. You got a girlfriend on your first day? The men in our family are popular with the ladies. That's right! What? Why do you pour water on your rice these days? What? Would you like me to make you something else? It's okay. You're the best cook there is. I just like it like this. No! Oh, no. Go take it off. Oh, right. Did you do the laundry? What? He did all our laundry too. I did yours too while doing mine. You're busy as is. You made Dad do the laundry? Of course not. Take a look at this. Why is it blue? Dad did this? This one's expensive. God, why did he… I should throw it out. Damn. -Hee-jung. -Yes? I think Do-won is lonely. Go play with him then. No, I don't mean like that. You know… It's hard for you. And for me too. Come on. What's with you? Are you crazy! Your father's here! Oh, please! Follow me. Honey! I cried in secret I held my sunken heart I held my sunken heart My love gone, Ms. Lee Someday we will meet Oh, Ms. Lee! Welcome. You scared me! You've become senile, old pal. Don't sneak up on me! Getting ready to hit on another granny? Goodness. Listen. You got to live your life to the fullest. What's with your hair, pal? Your buddy's a barber for Christ's sake. Come here. Let's put some pomade on it. My hair is fine! It's too flat. Let's curl it and fluff it up. -Come on. -No! He's here. Why am I feeling so thirsty? Young-hwan. Do you still get nervous too? Of course not. Wipe the sweat off your nose. You're like a dog in heat. You're that excited? At this old age? Who are you calling old here? People live to 100 these days. I'm still alive and kicking! Let me tell you about the women we're meeting. I'll show you pictures of the lovely flowers. You'll be shocked! Cut it out. Come on. Pretty backsides and gorgeous faces! -They're voluptuous and-- -Why you! Is that all you think about? Cut it out! I'm just going to leave after eating with them. You two deal with them. By the way, are they coming or not? I'm starving. Why are you always so doubtful? It must be them. Hello? Oh, Ms. Koo! Of course! We've been waiting since yesterday! Really? I see. Okay. Hey. The lovely flowers are finally here! DINER When's the chicken gizzard coming? It's really good here. Everything's good here. The grilled eel is to die for. I love everything here. Deok-gi loved gizzards. Remember how much he loved it? Not just that. He loved all kinds of chicken dishes. I even saw him eat chicken toenails. We used to eat gizzards with him all the time. Hyeon-sik? How about livening up the mood? No can do. Please, Hyeon-sik? Just have a drink. Fine. Am I asking too much though? God… Be! Be! Be-Bop-A-Lula She's my baby Catch a tiger in the mountains Catch fish in the sea You can't drink beer Without a bottle opener Life is a highway towards the sunset The traveler goes like the clouds Getting lost on the way Be! Be! Be-Bop-A-Lula She's my baby You keep bringing up Deok-gi lately. Did you hear from him? I hope he's doing well. Hope he didn't die on the streets. He left home so long ago. I heard he worked at a construction site. Or that he's a seafarer now. I really want to find Deok-gi. You know, I owe him so much. How can I forget? What I'm saying is… Let's go for one more bottle of beer. Let's just share one bottle. Please? SPECIALIZED IN COLOR PHOTOGRAPHY What? You want to take a picture? Why don't we take our funeral portraits? What do you say? If you have it ready, they say you'll live longer. Let's do this. -I don't want to take it. -Soon-ho! Let's go in. Come on! -Hello. -Hi. -Well… -You're so stubborn. This is a bad idea, Young-hwan. We can't take our funeral portraits dressed like this! Let's dress up nicely and take good pictures then. -Okay? -I agree! -It's late. Let's go. -Right. I'm sorry. We'll make sure to come take it next time. Sure. Let's have one more drink before calling it a night, for our lovely life. You two drink. I have to meet Mi-sun. Come on. Don't ditch us. Let's just have one more drink. I even went on a blind date. Meeting the ladies wasn't just for me. For God's sake. Then why don't we all do anything we want to do. One thing each. Soon-ho! Don't yell. I'm not deaf. We all have one thing we're dying to do, right? I don't know. I never thought about it. He means stuff like longevity, wealth, honor, and women. The youngest is drunk the most. My goodness. -Wait. Soon-ho! -What… Don't worry. He's not wearing the hearing aid. Young-hwan! Let's do something about your hair! -Let go of my hair! -Let me do it. -Come here, you! -Get off me! -You little… -Hey, let's go. Chief. Shouldn't we build a nice, strong place as if our own families will live in it? Sir! You can't come in here! I came to meet you. Mr. Park referred me to you. You want to buy a house and remodel it? That's right. I'd like to make four rooms. Do you have a house in mind? Let's find one together. This house is nice! You work mostly with men. Can't you find a nice one to date? Stop changing the subject. When are you going to sell our old house? Who'd buy it? You might be duped. Just leave it be. Here. Try this. Salty? It's so good. But, Mom… I'm going to sell the house. Okay? I'm not selling. I never will. Come on, Mom. I let you know just now. I'm selling it, okay? But a house costs a lot. No one's living in it now, so they'll sell it for a cheap price. Just help me fix it up, okay? Well, I'd like a house where I can live with Mi-sun too. The three of us can help her out! You know how hard that is? Count me out. And he can't hear well. Yes, I can! And I understood everything! Anyway, help me fix it up after I buy it. Okay? Ms. Lee! We're buying it! Okay? Three people. Come on. Think of what you want to do. -I don't know. -A towel. Let's soak in the hot tub. What do I want? You look like you have something you want. Your first love? I'm a man, you know. Seeing you guys married with kids makes me so lonely! I should've married my first love way back when. Hye-ja, was it? The girl you met before the military service? First love, my foot. You always go on blind dates! I met with countless grannies hoping I'd bump into Hye-ja. That's why! Why not just find her yourself? Why all the blind dates? Stupid excuses. I know. So I sent my boys to find her. What boys? No need to know. And I found out her husband died early. So, Hye-ja lives alone now. -Look at this guy. -Alone. What a sly fool! You even looked into it? Listen. I met countless grannies, but they were nothing compared to my Hye-ja. I don't know why I was so naive back then. If it was now, I'd sweep her off her feet! Oh, Hye-ja! You know? Why hesitate then? Let's go now. To where? You know where she lives. Let's go! -Come on! -No! Wait! Sounds fun! What? But she has a mean side. Why didn't you stay with Hye-ja if you loved her so much? We were going to run away together on a night train. But when the train pulled in, I didn't let her get on. But I don't regret it. Fool! How many women did you hit on like that? Women are to be loved, not hit on. You're right. -Stop laughing. -All right. Welcome. May I help you? Well… Oh, my. It's Hye-ja! Does she recognize me? How did that fool find me? Think he's doing okay? Of course, he is. Don't you know he's a dunce when it comes to love? Arms up, please. Dear God. -Hey. -Hey. Did you meet her? How did it go? I got a custom-made suit. You fool. You didn't come here to buy a suit! How can the pants be ripped? Hold on. I'll be right there. -What pants are you talking about? -What? I'm sorry. I'm in a hurry. The pants ripped! It's an emergency! Hello. Where to, ma'am? Get in. -What? I don't want to share a cab. -Goodness. Say hello to my friends. This is my Hye-ja. -Hello! -Hello! What? Hello. -I'll be going then. -No! Wait! She's in a rush. Someone's pants ripped. Where to, ma'am? Flowers Wedding Hall. Okay, then. Let's go. Oh, my God! It's a one-way street! So what? He doesn't care. He drove a tank in the Vietnam War. -What? -Hold on tight! I'm going fast. Oh, my! Hey, I'm dizzy! I got caught. You crossed the center line. I'm sorry. It's an emergency. I'm dying! Help me! I feel so dizzy and weak! Are you okay, honey? It hurts, honey. It's urgent! Must you hold us back? What are you looking at? If he dies, it'll be your fault! Then we'll escort you, sir! Great acting. -You should be actors. -Right! It was perfect teamwork. You're like Bonnie and Clyde. Oh, please. I played along because I'm in a rush. Honey. You are just as beautiful as you were 50 years ago. Thank you for helping me today. But we parted long ago. Let's just leave it at that. But… Hye-ja! Pal! Are you sick? My goodness. I'm not sure. You must be lovesick. You don't know how I feel. By the way, why do you hang that up? You weren't even in the Marines. You can make fun of me, but not the Marines. Okay? And it's called interior decorating, you idiot. Whatever, pal. Here. Have some of this. Abalone porridge, your favorite. Here. -With black pepper? -Of course. -I'll eat it. -Sure. -What would I do without you? -Right? This one too. -Good afternoon. -Hi. -I brought some laundry. -Sure. -The stains won't come out. -I see. Hello? What are you doing, honey? I'm at the dry cleaners. Why? I'm in the mood today. What do I do? In the mood for what? You crazy? Come here quickly. Let's make a sibling for Do-won. Are you in heat? What? Well, I'm about to. But what if I go? You're too gentle in bed. It's because Dad is home. Today's our chance. Pick me up now. You mean it? Then you'll really go all the way? Of course, my love! And pack me a good dinner. Okay, honey? I'll need my strength! You know? She hung up? Father! Where are you going at this hour? To deliver food to Min-guk. He should just eat out. Where's Do-won? Playing at a friend's house. Give me that. I'll give it to him. It's okay. I can go. You go and take care of Do-won. Give me that. But… -See you later. -Okay… Darn it! What's wrong? Nothing, Dad. Let's share it. Why close it? Wait, Dad! What's with all the beans? Son? You like grilled eel? Why did she pack this? Have some water, Dad. It's raspberry wine! Anyway, have you found anything on what I asked? Oh, that… I searched and ask around at the borough office. His registration was cancelled. Maybe he passed away. That's nonsense! He's not dead! You're a cop! How come you can't find one man? Come on. You won't pay up? Of course, I will. You're making me annoyed again. I'll pay up by doing something else, sir. So please. Don't call me sir! You stupid old geezer. Sir! You're our main model. Boss! You stupid fool! Respect the elderly. Sorry, sir. Do things rationally. -I was trying to, sir. -Why you! Sir, have a seat. Please sit down comfortably. You bastard. Clean up after yourself! Hurry up! You idiots! Sir. Is something bothering you? I can't do this anymore. Do you want to go back to living on the streets? That'd be terrible. It breaks my heart. As you wish. But pay off your debt first. What debt? We've been feeding and housing you all this time. But have you ever managed to sell one product for us? -Not even a single one. -But… It's in your employment contract. You can go if you want, but we will make your family pay off your debt. Boss! We saw your wife and pretty daughter. Boss! You'll keep working? Yes, sir. I'll work hard. -I'll do my best. -Good. Get changed and get back to work. -Yes, sir. -Go get them! You're Ms. Popular today, Mom. Men are all the same. They all like pretty girls. How about coming on to her like when you two first met? She's really picky. It'll be hard. She still can't remember anything? Last week, she thought I was a volunteer worker even after we had lunch together. How will you have a wedding when she can't remember? Wait a second. Remember when I caught you two dating? Where was it? You tried hard to date in secret, but it was no use. Mi-sun and I have many fond memories. Yes. That's it! Fond memories! How do you like this place? It's nice. In this place, they take song requests. Anything you want to listen to? We met in a place just like this. He gave me a piece of paper like this to write a song request. But I didn't know how to write, so I couldn't write anything. Things were rough for everyone back then. Your handwriting is beautiful. My husband taught me. "PERHAPS I WILL REMEMBER" Isn't this going overboard? It's to help her remember. Here they come! I haven't listened to those songs I like in ages. I had a lot of fun. Really? Then let's go there again. If my husband finds out, he'll be furious. What do we have here? Were you on a date or something? Who are you boys? What? "Boys"? Watch your mouth! Acting tough in front of a girl, aren't you? I'd move if I were you! Sir? Let's just go! Sure. You're not going anywhere. Are you scared? You're chicken, aren't you? I can tell. Oh, no! What do I do? Be careful! -Oh, my goodness. -Take this! -Oh, my God. -Soon-ho! Are you okay? It wasn't me, Soon-ho. You're all friends, aren't you? Act your age! One of my husband's friends was like a playboy too. He'd talk my husband into going clubbing with him. They went to practically every club in town. Then I caught them red handed. Oh, is that so? Yes! Then there was another fool. He always said he'd build houses, but ended up tearing them down instead. He borrowed money from everyone and invested in some land. But he lost everything. My husband lost big time too! I think your husband must break ties with those friends. Of course, he must! If I hadn't done anything, they'd ruin his life! But then, he's stupid for being fooled by them. Dad! Hey, you're home early. Yes. Dad! I found him! -What? You did? -Yes. I got his address too. That's him, right? But he's in a bad situation now. I don't think you should get involved. What? What do you mean why? I found Deok-gi! Hurry! There are two illnesses we must stay clear of in life. Palsy and Alzheimer's! What are they again? -Palsy and Alzheimer's! -Palsy and Alzheimer's! Why avoid them? When you're young and healthy, your children are good to you. But after a week in the hospital, your daughter-in-law can't stand it! It'll hurt your pride. You should never let something like that happen. Madams and sirs! Please stay healthy. If you get sick, I'll be heartbroken! I mean it. Now, let's hear a word from our president. Give him a hand. To tell you the truth, I came to sell this product after recovering from palsy. I almost died. I could endure the pain, but my family had to… Now! Everyone! If you take this medicine, it'll protect you from Alzheimer's and even prevent hair loss at the same time! Now, it's gift time! Everyone gets a box of tissues! Give us a big hand! Hand out the boxes. What happened to Min-guk? Is he coming or not? His father started this. He'll come. What's taking Young-hwan so long? There he comes. They're getting ready to leave! -Why isn't Min-guk coming? -He'll be here soon. We have to stop them on our own. Let's go! -Okay. -Okay. Hurry! How annoying! God damn it. Just go inside and rest. Park, you do it. Tell him to go in and rest. Damn it. Let's go. There they are! My friend took their pills and died! We called the cops! You're in big trouble! You'll go to prison for sure! -You jerk! -Bastards! -Who are you old geezers? -Stop there. Get down! Just go! What the hell? Why did we stop? Why? A cab is blocking the way. Go around it! Hurry! You're yelling at me? No, sir. Sorry, sir. -Let's hurry. -Look. My son is a cop! You're all dead! A cop? Then call him over! Do it! It hurts! Let go! No! It hurts! Those stupid bastards! No! Stop! Hey! Get in now! Dad! It hurts! How frustrating! Did you lose your tongue? Are you mute now? Hyeon-sik. How's your health? You're not sick, are you? Deok-gi? Say something, please! Stop it. It's been years. He'll tell us what happened eventually. You should eat first, Deok-gi. Excuse me! Here, Deok-gi. Let me pour you a shot. I thought you were a goner, but here you are. Stop being on the run and start over. Don't worry, and listen to us. Where were you all these years? You didn't remarry, right? Hyeon-sik. He should meet his family too. Right. How could I? Let's leave it at this for today. Sure. You have no place to stay for now, so stay with Hyeon-sik for a few days. What? My place? Deok-gi and me staying together? But I don't sleep with men at my house. Fine! Let's live together. Let's go, pal. JEIL BARBERSHOP I'm popular with the ladies because I'm so kind. Nothing wrong with being kind, right? Deok-gi? Are you crying? But… Fine. Cry all you want! Go ahead and cry your heart out! JEIL BARBERSHOP -What's up? -Hi. Hyeon-sik's fast asleep. Are you okay? I am. Thank you. I'm the one who should thank you. It was hard to find you. But now that you're back, I'm so happy Thanks. Be! Be! Be-Bop-A-Lula She's my baby Catch a tiger in the mountains Catch fish in the sea You can't drink beer Without a bottle opener When's the last time we dressed up like this? Just like our good old days! When did you order suits here? She makes good suits. Have a nice day! Why come here all dressed up like this? You'll see. My goodness. What a lovely day! Ms. Lee? -Have you been somewhere? -Going somewhere? -To make a call. -Sure. I'm sorry. Chief? The front door is… How did you meet my daughter? I found out that she's an architect while looking for you. I thought it'd be nicer for us to live together in your old house. Thank you. Sure. Let's enjoy our lives now. Thanks. -Put it on right! It's crooked! -You have to do it like this. -Leave some room to spare! -Okay. -About 6mm. -Okay. Mom? Why did you come? I wanted to see our old house. Ms. Lee! How about going for lunch? Hello. Hyeon-sik? How have you been? Mom! Honey! What did you call him? Eun-ji! What's so funny? It's a show about foreigners visiting friends in Korea. It's so funny. You know I've tried so hard to find Deok-gi. -Yes. -And now I want to help him out. But I can't bring him to live here. So I bought a house to live with my friends. What? Wait. You bought a house, Dad? Yes. I'm sorry I didn't discuss it with you and your wife first. What are you saying? What do you think? I'm saying I'm moving out to live with my friends. You're moving out to live with your friends? Yes. And I want you to live comfortably. I hated being a burden to you. You're no burden, Dad! Time goes by so fast. It seems like just yesterday that we bought that TV. Dad. Did we do something that hurt your feelings? Why can't you understand? I want to move out to live comfortably. Then you can live comfortably with your family too! But Hee-jung, Do-won and I love living with you. Why do you love it? When I nag and I'm always in the way. No, that's not true! I just want to live comfortably with my friends before I die. Why are you-- But I should take care of you! I'll be good, Dad. Forgive me, Father. You didn't do anything wrong. You're the best daughter-in-law. Anyway, why are you acting like a dutiful son all of a sudden? I'm not acting! I'm trying to be one. And Mom would be furious! Grandpa? Yes? Oh, my. You're awake, Sweetie? I won't go to kindergarten and will play with you. Of course, you should go. You need to go learn to become a great adult. I'll come visit you every day. Don't cry. Oh, my. Such angels. How will you survive this harsh world? -All packed up, sir? -Yes, it's all done. You should hurry then. She must be waiting. Thank you so much for being like our daughter. It's my pleasure. She reminded me of my mom who passed away. So I loved to be. That's good. God, this is so nice. Gather around! It's our house! Deok-gi! Let's all get in the picture. -I'm good. -Come on! Where's Mi-sun's nameplate? Well, she's one with you. -All right. -But still… Wait. Let's take one first. -Move your head. -Like this? -Don't block the nameplates. -Come on. One, two, three! -Guys, Mi-sun is missing! -Smile. -What? She's gone? -Where did she go? Mi-sun! -Let's go. -Find her! Mi-sun! Mi-sun! Mi-sun! Do you know who I am? Of course! How could I forget? You're my husband, Soon-ho. Here. I'll give you a piggyback. You always say that when you can't carry me anymore! Get up! Honey? I'm sorry. For what? I mean, thank you so much. Isn't it pretty? It's mine! Stop that! -He's so funny. Oh, my. -You pushed it. -Oh, my God! -I'm a ghost! Go away! Don't! Faster! No one can beat me at eating corn! -Hey. Let's do it again. -No. -Come on. -I'm stuffed. Then let's play chess! If you bet money, then I'll play. -Should we plant some corn? -Yes! It'll take too long to grow! Stolen corn tastes best. Right! Working hard, old man? You must be hot. Stop it! That will cool you down! -Rock, scissors, paper! -Paper! These too, please. Thanks. -Rock, scissors, paper! -Paper! Sorry. Mop my room too. You did that on purpose!

Looks like you owe me double. Wait. You had zero last game. No, I didn't. That was two games ago. Yes. It was two games ago. No! It was the last game! Gosh. I'm lucky I didn't play. -Wait. Soon-ho. -What? I think you should get her checked thoroughly at the hospital again. She doesn't look like an Alzheimer's patient. Right? Hey. What's the matter? What's wrong with you? I'm going to the bathroom. -Are you sick? -Are you okay? -No! What are you doing? -Hey. -How could you knock it over? -It's all mine! -What are you doing? -Come on. It's ruined. I hate you! -My goodness. -Hi. Are you buying me a drink for a change? -Why? You don't like it? -I love it. -Here. Have a drink. -Sure. -I'll pour you. -It's okay. -That's enough. -All right. Thanks. Cheers. Actually, I have something to tell you. What is it? I have cancer. I don't have much time. I didn't tell anyone else. We need to drink. Let's get totally hammered. I'm not letting you go tonight. Fine. Let's drink all night. -Order another side dish. -Okay. The onion pancake is good here. One onion pancake, please! Here. ASSORTED CANDIES What's all this? All faded yellow. Aren't they letters? They're unopened, old letters. Wait. They were sent years ago. Sent by Yoon Deok-gi. Yoon Deok-gi? FROM YOON DEOK-GI My goodness. Yoon Deok-gi sent these letters, but they weren't opened. I'm late. I'm sorry I'm so late. Mom? Eun-ji. Please leave. I'm sorry, but you'll have to go. Leave! Eun-ji! Stop it. Mom! ASSORTED CANDIES What's that? How cute. Isn't it time you told Min-guk? He's your son. He needs to know. What you're doing is terrible from his perspective. Min-guk will blame himself if you suddenly die. I'm tired. I'm going to bed. I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner. I've been working really hard all my life. I didn't want Mom to feel lonely without him. So I've been working really hard for her not to feel his absence. I know. Your father must be proud of you. We waited for so long, but he didn't come back. But still, can't you give him another chance? I'm asking you. He wasn't there when we needed him! Now that we're okay, he shows up? Still, he's your dad. Can you please forgive him? Doctor. There must be something you can do. I'm sorry. -But… -I'm very sorry. Don't just say sorry. Doctor! Oh, my. It must be bad indigestion. My stomach felt so heavy that I had a dizzy spell. Right, Dad. Where's Do-won? Should I bring him? No. Don't bring him here. He could catch something. It's no use trying. You know very well. We tried everything before your mom passed away. Your pretty mom lost all her hair during the chemo. She became all skin and bones. She held my hand and said, "Honey, I want to eat gimbap from the restaurant near the bus terminal." But… I couldn't let her have it. All because of her treatment that didn't even heal her. Dad. What do I do now? If you're gone, what do I do? You're Do-won's father now, you fool. Work hard and live for him. Right. Yes, Dad. EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER Hurry up! Come on! -Yes, come on.

Get up! Don't play dead. Get up already. Don't kid around! JEIL BARBERSHOP I came because I knew you'd be waiting pitifully. Don't call me out like this again. I was waiting for my love! What's pitiful about that? We're old now. But I'm alive and well! And my love for you is still in my heart. Who cares if we're old? It's been ages since a man said he loved me, so my heart leaped. It reminded me of my youth. I liked it to be honest. But I don't want to work at love in my old age. Hye-ja. Being here with you right now makes me feel like I've went back to when we were dating. Though you may not love me back, I'll love you till I die. I don't like these flowers. I like lilies. Wait. Hye-ja! Only Young-hwan's missing. We're all with our loved ones, finally. It's taken so long. I miss him so much. He always helped others. He's a terrible friend! He used to be the healthiest among us. If your child dies, you bury them in your heart. Where do you bury a friend when they die? That fool! I miss him like hell! We must really enjoy life from now on! Let's live life to the fullest! Right. Young-hwan! Young-hwan! We miss you! Be! Be!
