THE QUACK based on the novel by Tadeusz Dołęga-Mostowicz Directed by Screenplay by Director of Photography Music by Chief Medical Officer - This surgery can't be successful. - He's a surgical genius. Dr Dobraniecki. He's a great surgeon, too. Good. - What hands! - But will the patient make it? So what? The surgery was brilliant. And he didn't damage the meninges. And he's so handsome! He's got a beautiful wife and he's head over heels in love with her. Pity. The operation's a new triumph of surgery. Yes, when they brought her in, we didn't think she would make an hour. Nobody but our professor would dare to do such a surgery. You exaggerate. We've seen more surgeries like that. Everything's fine, Professor, the temperature is 35.9, Blood pressure's 114, the pulse is very weak. Slight arrhythmia: 60-63 Great. She'll make it. I have a family celebration. Hello. Yes? Your butler. Very urgent. Very urgent? That means that I mustn't be late for dinner. Please tell him I've already left. The professor has already gone home. It's time for us too, gentlemen. - You going to the cafe? - No, for a game of bridge. Today is the professor's anniversary. Any woman can envy his wife such a husband. He's a lucky man. Seems to me you hate him, doctor. But to me it seems that you're in love with him. Beata! Don't be cross with me. It's my job. It's for you, Beata. Dear Rafał, I don't know if you ever forgive me for leaving you. You've always been so busy with your work and I missed love so much. - I know that was so cruel of me. - But Beata! It was so wrong to do that. It was so wrong to do that. I couldn't help it I've fallen in love. Don't try to find me. I've taken Marysia with me. I couldn't live without her. Forgive me, if you can. Beata. Beata! The thing is.. I can't offer you the luxuries you're used to. Never mind, Janek. I love you. Beata. We'll be happy, Beata. We'll be happy. You'll see. She betrayed. Woman and Clown. Redundant Man Woman Seeking Love. 'Scuse us, gov, will you lend us a fiver? Against the securities of the state's monopoly on alcoholic beverages. - What? 'What?' Don't 'what' me or you'll be 'whatted' yourself. The Scripture says ''The 'what' that you 'what' thy neighbour with" "shall be the one you'll be 'whatted' yourself with." You, a citizen of a thirty-million country with access to the sea. - What do you need, sir? Good health, happiness, wellbeing... Apart from those, I wish I could fill my empty stomach with a 45% solution of alcohol... - Here you are. Allow me, my benefactor to repay you your kindness. I mean my company. You may have the honour. Noblesse oblige! It's on me. You're wet and cold. Step into my place to get warm. Can you hear that? That's a cricket playing behind my hearth. Allons. Bartender! Give us another one. Mind you, it's not hard to be somebody. It is hard to be a nothing. Take it from me. Voila Because if, unfortunately, you are somebody Valkyrie! Bring us some gherkins. You're doing badly? A trifle misfortune happens and you're breaking. Just like you have. Of course. I knew it. A woman? Unfaithful? So what? What is it? What is it? That's everything. Everything. Go away, you demon! An unclean spirit! That's the way it is with women. I don't understand. I... anything... for her... Anything. And she... Why? She longed for love. But nobody will love her as I do. - Nobody in the whole world. - Become nothing. And you'll find happiness. The law's on my side. The daughter is mine. Mine. Philosopher! You coming? Will you pay, Your Excellency? Bartender! Are you dumb or what? Give the gentlemen his change. And now we'll see you home so that you don't go astray like a child in fog. - Where are we going? - Into the unknown, my friend. - What is it? Where are we? - It's the end of the world. Drunk or what? Who are you? I don't know. Where's your home? I don't know. - He's drunk. - What'd you mean you don't know? No home? No wife? I don't know. I don't know. Marysia! Have you seen the today's newspaper? - I have. - Where is it? Over there! Marysia, give that to me. My kite! Never mind, honey, we'll make you another one. So big! Like the one I got last year from Daddy? When will Daddy be back? Keep playing here. I won't be long. We weren't meant to be You won't die, Janek. You mustn't die. The doctor will come. I thought we would be happy together. Do you remember? You gave me so much happiness. So much happiness. No. I did harm to you. Janek! How can you say that? Yes, I did. To you and your child. And him, too. It's wrong to build your happiness on other people's misery. When I die, will you go back to him? No. Will you? You will forget. - Yes. - [inaudible] - You'll be fine together again. No! No! No! No! No! No! No! PROF WILCZUR MISSING Prof Wilczur went missing in mysterious circumstances. Search efforts going on for weeks - still no success. I asked him his name. 'I don't know.' 'You don't?' So I've brought him over to the station, sir. Full name, please. Your name, please. I don't know. Where are you from? I don't know. You don't know where you're from? Some people gave me these clothes and then I went wandering. Been wandering since. A long time now. Everybody asks me where I'm from but I don't know. I think really hard but... I can't remember. Do you get headaches? Perhaps you are ill? Ill? Ill... He ain't ill, sir. A vagrant. You'll stay the night in the cell here and tomorrow I'll send you to the district Give him something to eat. It'd be great to find that one, wouldn't it, sir? We'd get a reward. Prof Wilczur missing. Suicide? Great surgeon, prof Wilczur gone missing in mysterious circumstances. That's that doc. A handsome man. Prof Wilczur missing. Suicide? Great surgeon, prof Wilczur gone missing in mysterious circumstances. Is the master home, Bronisław? I'd like to see my husband. The professor hasn't been found yet. Whatever do you mean? He went out the same day you left, madam, and has never come back. Dr Dobraniecki might have some news. Madam. Doctor, what happened to Rafał? What happened to him, for God's sake? We don't know anything. We've been looking everywhere. Vanished into thin air. I thought you, as the wife, would... That's terrible. Both of them. Because of me. Terrible. What are you going to do now? Your husband must have provided for you. I'm not taking a penny. I'll get by on my own. I'll find a job. Please, don't judge me so harshly, doctor. I'm not a bad person. I'm just unhappy. Will find a job, will find a job, will find a job. A seamstress, a seamstress, a seamstress. For vagrancy - six weeks of custody. Daddy. What? A job? No jobs here. Who's that? A hungry man. Bread? - No bread here. So you've been a vagrant for 10 years? Mum, stop working! It's so late! Will be done in a moment. I'll stay up a bit but my daughter will have the most beautiful dress in the whole town. My dearest, sweetest Mummy! Your fingers are all pricked. Do you know, Marysia, that your mother's fingers can have a rest soon? I'm going to play at Mrs Szkopek's cinema. No, at the cinema? That is so lucky! But now - off to bed! Now! When I say I can't remember they don't believe me. But that isn't my fault, is it? Chased away, like a dog. That's the way they are. People. Exactly. They say you're a vagrant. No papers on you. You can't do anything about it, can you? This used to be my mate. When he died I took his papers. Although I've got mine. Just in case. Take them. They'll come in handy. Antoni Kosiba. For me? Thank you kindly. Here. Kosiba. Finally, we have some good music at our cinema. You're obsolete mechanically. The sound cinema - that's the thing! Sound? Never! People on the canvas talking? Such deceit? Not on my life! Bon appetit. Bitter, isn't it? Oh, I got the wrong stuff. You're obsolete mechanically. Praised be Jesus Christ. Forever and ever, amen. May I take some rest here? Come over. Eat with us. Thank you kindly. Sonia, see to it. Where are you from? Far away, sir. As far as Kalisz. Kalisz? God knows where that Kalisz is. Sure it's far away. The world's a huge place and full of all sorts of people. And what is your surname? Kosiba. Antoni Kosiba. - Kosiba, right. - Why do you keep wandering? You don't settle down anywhere? I look for work. - What work? Any work. I've done everything. What do you mean? It's 12 years since I started. I've learned a lot of things. 12 years? You don't have a home of your own? I don't. And you don't have a woman? I don't. Why not? I don't know. Women only bring depravation and trouble. But one must marry. That's God's law. Vasily. Vasily. Prokop's son. A few months ago he broke his legs. It's all because of that curse. Shut your trap! I can't take it anymore. Death is better than a life like this! Vasily. If I were old, I wouldn't care. It's God's punishment for father's sins. Don't say that, my son. Am I to suffer because the father is cursed? Why me? Was it me who took take the mill away from my uncle? No. Not me, but you, father. Don't say that. Why am I crippled for that? When I look at them legs of mine I wish I'd never been born. What? What do you want here? It's a few months since you broke them, right? Five. And who set them? Dr Pawlicki. From the town. He said I'd be fine. He put the legs in splints. But when he took them off he said that nothing could be done. I wanted to take him to Vilnius to hospital. But the doctor said there was no point. Because God himself couldn't help him. - Not true. - What do you mean? I might be able to help. What are you talking about? A doctor couldn't and you could? I might be able to. The skin must be cut here. The bones will have to be broken again. And properly set. Aligned. You'll be fine. You'll be able to walk like before. No way. I forbid you! Even the doctor was helpless and you, uneducated, want to do that? No way! No way! Father! I want him to do that. Vasily. What's this nonsense? Come to your senses! You're the only one I've got left. You want me to be a cripple forever? God, have mercy on me. God, have mercy on me. And what if you can't fix him? You'll be right to do anything, even kill me. I feel sorry for him. And for you too. Will you swear the boy won't die? I will. Come, then. On the Virgin Mary? On the Virgin Mary. On Christ the Saviour? On Christ the Saviour. I swear. Aren't you afraid? I'm not afraid. You'll see for yourself. Won't make a sound. I'm prepared. You just fix me. I know, dear Vasily, that you're brave. But you might shake even if you don't want to. You'll ruin things. I have to tie you up. Don't look here. Look at the ceiling. Christ, have mercy. Through my fault. Through my fault. Through my fault. My son! God has mercy on us, sinners. My son! My dear Vasily. You're alive. Alive. Will I walk? You will. Like everybody? He's fallen asleep. Let him. Sleep makes you strong. The young miss plays as well as her late mother, doesn't she? She plays well. Well, Vasily show'em what you can do. Go on. Oh my God, you're walking. You've saved my son. Stay with us. Live with us like one of our own. Make here your own home. Thank you. I can move it, eh? An evil spirit, I say. That's a sinister thing, folk. May your tongue wither away! He makes miracles. A quack! A quack! You'll stay with us, won't you? We'll give you a haircut. And some nice clothes. You can't wear them rags. You look just like a scarecrow now. Will you stay? Don't think, my dear Mrs Szkopek that's he's an ordinary quack. God strike me down if... I do believe you. It's just that my eyelid's started to twitch, see? He doesn't charge a penny. And he shares with others, to boot. My dear, I'm seeing you double. What's the matter? Oh, you must be wrong. Maybe I got the wrong medicine? The one for colics. So, you're saying that the quack is so extraordinary? One ticket, please. Which class? 75 groszy? No. 50 groszy. Here you are. And the change, please. The change. I'm very sorry. Thank you. That quack did quite a job on him! And he'd help you, too. You say so? Mr Woydyłło, please. We've kept a seat for you. You needn't have. No crowds here. Good evening, ma'am. - Good evening. - First-rate seat, third rate price, please. - Why's that? - Just pulling strings, Mrs Szkopek. It's me who attracts the punters, isn't it? - A programme? - No, thank you. Already got one. Thank you. A proletarian, blast him! So quick to shake hands. Maybe I'm not so keen on shaking paws with paupers like that! A first-rate seat at a third-rate price. By pulling strings. He quite fancies Miss Marysia. You won't even give me a tiny look. Any other girl in the town would be so happy If I loved her like I love you. Why so flushed all of a sudden? I can see that in the dark. Must be about a date with Mr Czyński. - Leave me alone, please! - Who says so? Me. If you are asked politely don't be intrusive. Politely? Fair enough. But Leszek. - I've asked you repeatedly... - Anything for you, miss. - not to come here. - Why? You don't like me so much? - You know why. - No, I don't. The whole town's talking about it. The whole town? My God! It'll do you no good. - The son of Mr Czyński, the CEO... - And of Mrs Czyński, a countess by birth. The whole town will be here soon. Because of me? I don't believe it. I told you so! - The business is much better now. - Absolutely! - Good evening, ma'am. - Good evening. The 75 groszy one, right? I've already seen this one but it's so lovely... Yes. Thank you. Nice, yes, but Mr Czyński is even lovelier! Quite a lot of perfume for his sake! - The Potiphar wife's here. - But Leszek! Quiet now. We're in the public eye now. They're all listening. My young master keeps hanging around here. Mr Czyński's in love. I beg you to leave now. Fine, but I'm allowed to look at you from over there? And to think about you? And to love you? Alright, but don't be cross with me. I won't be looking at you, either. I promise. No? Looking at is allowed. That's all rumours, my dear. And what pretence! She's older than me! - Mrs Szkopek. - What? - He kissed her. - He kissed her. In front of everybody! Mr Czyński? - Yes. Marysia? - Yes. Sodom and Gomorrah. I saw that with my own eyes. - Marysia. - Czyński? - Shame! - Shame! Sodom! No morals! No shame! It must be stopped! We won't have it! This town's had enough of that! Away with that! Scandal! This is how you repay me for taking you into my care? You and that gentleman? But I haven't done... No, you haven't and he hasn't! Just listen to the things people are saying. Horrible things. I have never heard... What's wrong in my talking to Mr Czyński from time to time? He's a decent man. He may be decent but when it's about a girl, everybody is... I'm dying, I'm dying ready to be carried out. What? I don't know which medicine to take and for what. The mechanics failing again, eh? We need to get a doctor, Mrs Szkopek. I don't want a doctor. What should we do then? Them doctors will lead you straight to the grave. You're talking nonsense. - How about Kosiba? - The quack? - He's no ordinary quack. He does real wonders. He's saved so many people from certain death. Crowds of people come to see him. Even from Vilnius itself. Really? I want the quack, then. Fetch the quack then. - She's right. An illness to him is, absolutely, a walk in the park, to break the bitch's neck. What? What bitch? That illness, I mean. Ah, so get that quack, yes. But he won't come here. Absolutely not. He never visits. Why don't you go and fetch him? And I'll carry that illness to him in my hands or what? He won't even talk to me. And I'm scared of him. Absolutely. What about Miss Marysia? The mill's nearby, just outside the town. Me? Getting the quack? Nah... Marysia, would you go and fetch him? Miss Marysia. Marysia, what's the matter? Nothing. I'm in a hurry. In a hurry? Alright then. Let me go, please! But of course. No, no! Why are you cross with me? I am not. But it all just doesn't make any sense. I'm just a small town poor girl. - And you... - are in love with that poor girl. Do you understand? Nobody in the whole world can tell me not to. Is the quack in? Yes. Go in, please. Bring her again in a week. God bless you and give you a lot of happiness. OK, goodbye. Thank you, grandad. God be with you. You wanted to see me, miss? Yes. My guardian is ill. Mrs Szkopek in the town. But in the town there is dr Pawlicki. She won't see him so could you come, please? I can't, miss. I don't go to the town. So many ill people waiting for me here. They're poor people. Can't afford a doctor. They must be helped. But Mrs Szkopek insisted... I can't. I can't, miss. Apologies, then. Miss. I'll come with you. Thank you, sir. I keep getting those piercing pains. Here and there. Marysia! - Yes? You're ready. Good. The guests seem to be arriving for the ball. Or this eyelid will twitch like this. Or the other one. Mr Quack! Go on, Marysia. - OK. This will twitch, and that, and all will... Can I fix that, Mr Quack? I'm taking so many medicines Won't mind taking more. What are you doing? What are you doing? Hope he won't put a curse on me. Leszek, I hear you're quite an avid cinema-goer now. Indeed, I like movies. You may go now. Didn't you see one Marysia at the cinema? Can't see how that's relevant. Only in that you and that Marysia are much talked about in town. I don't care about gossip. Your secret is now common knowledge. Don't forget who that missy is and what reputation she has. How can you say that about a poor yet decent girl? Decent? Don't be naive. Be a man! Is that so? Great. I will be one. Quite a party, eh? We haven't had one like this for ages. We're going to be very busy. Mrs Szkopek isn't coming. The quack's still in. But she's fine. The woman is as right as rain. The mechanics is in perfect order. - Absolutely. Excellent. Good evening. - We're enjoying ourselves a lot. - Naturally. Now the gentlemen ask the ladies to dance the mazur. - May I have this dance? - May I have this dance? But gentlemen! Not all at once! I've already promised the mazur to my husband. Here's the hubby. Here I am, honey. The mazur's starting in a moment. The partner hasn't turned up yet, see? Why don't you dance with me, miss? Thank you. I don't like dancing the mazur. Mr & Mrs Apothecary. What's their problem with her? Just they wait! Just they bloody wait! This is how you dance the mazur! Miss Marysia. Yes. Damn! Woydyłło! Congratulations, miss! On what? on being a Marysia, miss Marysia. What is it that you want from me? I don't mind at all. I'm in a great mood. I can sing you a song. Miss Marysia lives alone. So she often has Leszek round. That gives her a bad name. Who? Miss Marysia, la la la. Nice, isn't it? I wrote it myself. What do you think about it, miss? I'll be happy to explain it. In private. Woydyłło's a strong man. He'll break his bones. Mr Woydyłło. Your instrument. Go to hell, you old ass! Don't call me old! No more cuplés. - Play a waltz. - Right away. What cheek! To show off dancing after that! Let's leave here. The ball's a washout. I've come here to ask you one question. Will you marry me? Are you crying? No, I'm just happy. Let's leave here. I'll tell the parents tomorrow and in a few weeks... It's all like a dream to me. Am I really engaged? Yes, you are my fiancee. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. Holy Christ! Murderer. Murderer. Murderer. Help! It's for Mrs Szkopek. Tomorrow I'm going to town. You wouldn't go to town before. Are you going to a girl there? Perhaps. Help! They're still alive! Who? Quick! What have I done? Save them! - Who? - They're still alive! What's going on? We were passing there at the time. Along that road. He jumps onto the road. Shouting 'Help!' And there, oh God, They're lying on the road. Not breathing. So we decide to bring them over here to the quack. I can't manage this on my own. Must send for the doctor. Get the cart ready. I'll go. Give him a horse. - OK. On my way. Save them! Hot water! Quick! And you - out of the way. Leszek! Is he alive? Save my son, doctor! - I'll examine him right away, ma'am. - No need to disturb him. Double left arm fracture. I set the bones properly. - Don't interfere, please! He doesn't need any more attention. It's her that must be saved. - What's wrong with her? Bone caved into the brain. - Doctor! - Right away, ma'am. That's her last agony. Save her, doc. It's hopeless. Quick, doctor! Basal skull fracture. Meninges torn, hence the convulsions. Condition: hopeless. She'll be gone any moment now. Quick, doctor, for God's sakes. Save her, doctor, please! How could I save her, you fool? - Doctor, please! You could do an operation. Stop, will you? What good would an operation do here? Operate on a corpse? A basal skull fracture. Even a genius wouldn't help here. Savvy? Doctor, please! Right away. I'll give him an injection, ma'am Right away. Yes, indeed. An arm broken, but nothing serious. I'd give him an X-ray, anyway, though. The sooner, the better. If I had instruments like these I'd try myself. Thanks God you don't. They'd put you in jail. You're not allowed to practise. Can we move him to the car? I'll get the men right away. Come inside with me, please. Careful! Hold his head, like that. - Antoni! - Don't come in! Terrible, so terrible! He'll be fine, ma'am. Calm down, please. Do you think that girl... No, that's it for her. Death himself put an end to it. - Marysia! - Leszek! He's heard everything! No, that's just fever talking. Father's very happy you've recovered. Things as usual back at home. The maid gossiping as usual. Dr Pawlicki is grateful for spending a month at the Riviera thanks to you. I'd like go back home, mum. I'm completely fine, now. I'm feeling perfectly alright now. Hard to imagine I owe my life to you. If it hadn't been for you... That was nothing, miss. Nobody but you. You've done so much good to me. A complete stranger. You see, my child. I have no family. Nobody close in the whole world. Maybe that's why I grew to love you like my own daughter. Love me a little, if you can. Stay with me. Don't, miss. You see, I have nobody close in the whole world now. I used to think there is someone who... But he... he forgot. I remember a poem. My mum liked it a lot. How do you know this? I don't know. I don't know. What's this? She's alive? Move your head please. Again. Fine, fine. Well, sergeant. I have no doubts now. Mr Kosiba. Dr Pawlicki is accusing you of appropriating his instruments. Not appropriating. Stealing. What are you talking about, gentlemen? He's a holy man. He fixed my son. Vasily. He fixed him. A sin on your soul, sir. A sin. Sergeant, search the place, please. A sin, sir. Mr Kosiba. I have to arrest you. Good afternoon, sir. You're back at home, at last. Straight from the station to the orangery. Cut all the most beautiful flowers, please. And roses. Cut them all? Where do you want them delivered, sir? I'll do it myself. Must be for someone in the neighbourhood. Yes. For someone... - To jail. - Because of me? Of course. If he hadn't taken those instruments for you... They'll acquit him. I'll testify as a witness. I'll tell them how he saved my life. You'll be talking and he'll be doing time. And I'll be waiting him? Is that so? You stray! And why will you be waiting for him? By what right, eh? Because I will. I'll be waiting for him. - No, I will. - No, I will. What are you doing? - I can't be staying with you. - What nonsense, my dove. It's all your fault. What have I said wrong? She's at our mercy. She should cut that honour talk. At your mercy? There, there. I mustn't outstay my welcome here. Forgive me, I've been so silly. Don't cry. I'll give you anything. I'll give you my checked plain kerchief. I will. It's new. It was 2 zloties. Cross my heart. 2 zloties it cost. Ask her. It did. But stop crying, please. I will never forget you. But it's time for me. Where are you going? - To Mrs Szkopek's. - But she's got another girl now. I'll look for another job, then. Oh my God. Jesus Christ! Dear Michalesia. I have a request. Do you happen to know... Could you tell me where she was buried? - Who? That miss who was killed in the accident? - What accident? With me. Jesus Christ. What nonsense. Marysia from Mrs Szkopek's? Why bury her? She's alive. Alive? What? What? Marysia! Marysia. My darling! Nothing will tear us apart now. I've been waiting. Waiting so long. You were happier than me. Because I wasn't waiting for anything. You're alive. I would be dead now. No point in living without you. - My darling! ... can't live anymore without her. He wanted to kill himself. Over a girl like that. Some missy from the cinema was dearer to him than us? I'll never consent to this marriage! He loves her. You want a daughter-in-law with such a background? You lied to him about her. For his own good. He may hate for life for that. I don't want to lose him. Understand? What should we do, then? If we don't have a little heart for him now we'll never see him again. I'm going to the mill. Wait. I'll come with you. We're getting old, my love. We need more warmth. And he did all of that for me, you see. And now when I'm so happy he's in jail. We'll get him out. I'll get some of the best lawyers. My child. I have been to the room where the accused lived. And what sanitary conditions did you find in that room, doctor? Appaling. The floor covered with some junk. Litter. The air was stuffy it was hard to breathe. Where did he perform the operations? In that very room. Did you see the instruments that the quack used when operating? They weren't instruments. Just ordinary hammers, chisels, pliers... I saw a kitchen knife, and a garden saw with rust all over it. Can such tools, if used, lead to infection, death? There have been 72 cases of death in the last two years caused by treatments by various quacks in our district. You have quoted 72 cases of death, doctor. caused by treatments by quacks. That's right. Can you quote a case of death caused by the accused here? Despite his using rusty instruments? No, I can't. Splendid. You remember two people, seriously injured in a motorcycle accident, present here. They were brought to the mill. Where you were called. Do you who called you there? Apparently, that quack. Yes. The quack. Did the accused beg you to save the injured girl? Yes, but I didn't give her any aid. Having found her condition to be hopeless. Did the accused request to use your instruments then? No doctor would let such a a quack, a simple peasant... But the simple peasant did perform the surgery! And saved the patient with the instruments you wouldn't let him use. The instruments you later accused him of appropriating. Weren't you just afraid of professional competition? Your honour, I request to defend me against those attacks! Any more questions from the defence? Just one more. The last one. Doctor, if I you were in this man's position, and were confident you were able to save a human life, would you act as he did? Or would you let a young woman die? I refuse to answer this question. Thank you. No more questions. Now we'll get some celebrity as an expert witness. Prof. Dobraniecki as an expert witness. I must state that in all the cases examined by me the surgeries performed by the accused were performed absolutely correctly and saved the patients from death or permanent disability. The accused has no education. How would you explain the high quality of his procedures? I admit I am stunned myself. I used to know a surgeon of a similar talent and a confident hand like this quack. That was... No more questions? - No. - No. Thank you, professor. Next witness, Mrs Florentyna Szkopek. Why did you call a quack, not a doctor? If you had colics like I did, you'd the same, sir. Answer the question! No comparisons with the counsel! Isn't he a human? Stick to the topic. You mean about those colics? No more questions. Your witness. Did the accused help you? He did help me about the colics, sir... Address the court, please. But I still have a pain in the liver, Your Honour. The court is not interested in the witness's liver! What witness? You. That's a personal matter. Of course it's personal. See Marysia, the judge agrees with me. Those are personal matters. Why drag it out into the open? They might write about me in the papers. Enough! Goodbye! As to the quack, sir, cross my heart, I recommend him. You'll be thankful. Goodbye. God sent him to my house. He healed my son. He helped the neighbours a lot. We beg Your Honour to let him go. For God's glory and the benefit of people. We beg you. WE BEG YOU! I broke my arm. He couldn't work. He would never charge a penny. If someone poor was in need, he'd share with them. We beg you! Order or I'll have the room cleared! I admit that the sentence of first instance may seem too harsh. The accused is not of the worst kind of charlatans. He may have been prompted to practise by noble intentions. However, we do not represent mercy here. We are people of law. We mustn't forget that the accused broke it. Undoubtedly, there are some mitigating circumstances. Nevertheless we mustn't ignore the fact that theft is always theft. Also, we mustn't condone entrusting a human life to a quack whose knowledge and skills are not certified by appropriate authorities. It was by mere chance that this man here is in this room before this court. He doesn't belong here. Antoni Kosiba belongs to a university lecture hall. Before a university's senate. Awaiting not a sentence but the award of the degree of honoris causa of the department of medicine. Aren't the testimonies from the witnesses he healed living proof of his skills and knowledge? The prosecutor sees his guilt in the fact that holding no diploma the accused dared save his neighbours. Had he dived into water to save someone from drowning, would he have had to hold a certificate from a swimming school? I believe that any honest person would see it an honour to shake that worn-out dirty and yet the cleanest hand in the world. The accused may make a statement now. You have the right to make the final statement. You have the right to make the final statement. I don't have anything to say. It is all the same to me. ...illegally practised medicine, which is a crime. using someone else's instruments is also punishable. Taking into consideration the indisputable noble intentions of the accused, his unselfishness, and the fact that he was unable to perform a surgery without said instruments, this court of appeal finds it possible and just to acquit the accused. Mr Kosiba, we've won! You're free! Come to our place now. You'll have a rest there. We owe you so much! You don't need me anymore. I'll go to the mill. Why don't we give you a lift at least? We're going to the cemetery.. I must thank my mother for listening to my prayers. You are free! Let's go. Beata, nee Gontyńska Help us, doctor. Your father has lost consciousness He'll regain it forever soon. Father? He's your father. Prof. Rafał Wilczur. Marysia. Father! Dobraniecki, my dear fellow. Chief Medical Officer A interesting case, that. If there's no fever, he'll make it. Yes, professor, but you'll be late for your daughter's wedding. Thank you. Hold on professor, in a gown? Apologies. Work.
