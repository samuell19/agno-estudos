l YEARS Wait! You forgot me: Ma'it? Giraud. No visitors until further notice. - What did he do? - He's in the hole, sorry. You shouldn't worry. Long time without seeing him? l have a car. Do you need a ride? Tryin to make me feel better? No, l just want to talk. lt's my brother's. He's in for l years. Julien, wake up. ''ln winter we'll travel in a pink carriage with blue cushions. We'll be comfortable. A nest of mad kisses lies in each soft corner.'' One last time. l know it by heart. Give me a break. One last time l said. ''ln winter we'll travel in a pink carriage with blue cushions. We'll be comfortable. A nest of mad kisses lies in each soft corner.'' What happened? A fight with some asshole at the canteen. - Got moved to another cell. - How many in this one? - Just me. - It's better in some ways. Did you try the sweater? l don't like the colour. l put it back in the bag. How are you? - l think l've found a job. - Good. But it complicates things for Djamila and Michel. You like taking care of their kid? lt depends. And the new job? The salon at the shopping centre. - Sounds good, take it. - What about Julien? He's not your kid. l know, but l'm fond of him. And l like Djamila and Michel. They feel like family. What did Clovis inherit? A small kingdom bordered by the North Sea, the Escaut and the Cabr?sis. No. Combr?sis. - Where's that? - l don't know. - Finish your mash. - It's no good. lt's not very tasty indeed. Sorry, l'm late. That looks good. There's some left if you want. We must go, l have to get up at dawn. Sit down, we have to talk. What is it? Well... l've been thinking. l might take the job. Really? Listen, it's your decision. But it seems silly. lf you need more money, l can ask Michel. Julien really likes you. Don't you? You'll get bored in that beautician's. Anyway, it's up to you. Just let me know soon, so we can arrange things. Let's go, you can have dessert at home. l'm staying here. You can't. Come on, l'm tired. No. lf you don't behave l'll tell Dad. It's not your house. Dad's never home. Neither are you! l'll bring him back later. Are you on duty tomorrow? Yes, l start at six. Why don't you want to look after me anymore? That's not it, Julien. lf you leave l'll do what Karine's father did. What did Karine's father do? His wife left so he jumped out the window. Now he's in a wheelchair. l'm not your mother! l have my own life! - Have a nice day. - Thank you, goodbye. lt's a pity, you have the qualifications. l've found something better. ln the same field? No, it's a domestic job. It gives me a lot of freedom. We work a 10 hour day, but no one complains. Do they, Nathalie? Well, goodbye. l like it, it's soft. l'm glad. It suits you. - What about you? - What about me? What are you wearing? Under your skirt... Want to see? Just tell me. Nothing? What do you want? l don't know. Turn right. - What's your brother's name? - Sorry? Your brother in jail, what's his name? Jean, why? Maybe he knows my husband. - Straight ahead? - Yes. Are we early? l forgot, there's nothing to eat. That's ok. We'll make an omelette if you have eggs. l'm so sorry. l went swimming. ls Michel back? Still in Italy. He's bringing the lorry back tomorrow. What a life... You at the hospital and him on the road... But when we see each other... Really? To tell you the truth l'm the one who has to insist. - If l don't get what l want... - Then what? l'm a real pain! Come on, it'll be cold. He's a good pupil. His teacher is very pleased. l'm lucky to have you. You don't have the time, it's not your fault. How's it with your guy? Ok, why? Just asking. You never talk about him. lt's not that easy. Sometimes l just feel like we're strangers. The next day, l'm doing the ironing and l feel he's still here and always will be. You're amazing. l couldn't wait for l years. lf he behaves he might get out before. l shouldn't ask but, did you ever considered finding someone? Finding someone? Go out, find someone. You mean a boyfriend? A boyfriend, a lover. So you don't have to sleep alone. ln this house? In our bed? Wherever. lt's important for your equilibrium. - Chirac is dead! - What? Just kiddin. What's wrong? You didn't even come. ls it so important to you? - l have to go. - Already? How are you getting home? By bus. It stops right there. Bye. - l have to talk to you. - What do you want? You don't know who l am. Maybe l don't want to. l'm a warden at the prison. Now you know. Are you taking the piss? No, it's true. It doesn't change a thing. But you know my husband? Vincent Giraud: you know him? A little bit. l had to tell you, do you understand? Hey lucky boy! Taking showers whenever you want... Now that he's the new warden's bitch he's got to wash his ass every day! What happened? Why didn't you come last Tuesday? Don't get mad at me. Julien had appendicitis. Fuckin kid. He'd better not start messin things up between you and me. lt won't happen again. lt sucks. l needed new slippers. My soles are ruined. l also need that thing to cover my eyes. There are no shutters here. Can you do that? - l miss you. - l miss you too. You don't look well. l'm ok. l have trouble sleeping too. Because of me? No, come on... l started taking driving lessons. l made only five mistakes yesterday. What kind of car? None. It was just the theory. - What did you do wrong? - Didn't see a stop sign. You could've run over someone. Those slides go so fast you can't think. You don't think at a stop sign. You just stop. Reflexes. No more mistakes. One minute left, Vincent. Don't forget the eye mask. What's wrong? We've only had five minutes. ls he new here? Jean? No. Well he's new to the visitin\code(01f5) rooms. He called you Vincent. He likes me. Keep it quiet, it's pretty useful here. We met a few days ago. About the job. l remember. l've decided to take it. lt's too late, l've hired someone else. l'm sorry, miss. Mrs. Mrs Giraud. Mrs Giraud, please don't get so upset. ls there anything l can do? No, l'll be fine. Would you like to try our tanning bed? On the house. Time for your walk. Ma'it?. We have to talk. We've got nothing to talk about. We enjoyed it. Why should we stop? Go away! l care for you. Do you believe me? - What about Vincent? - He won't be out so soon. You don't get it, do you? We could have l years just for us. We'll have time to make love, to get to know each other. l don't want to get to know you. Why do you say that? l love Vincent, that's all. - You have a kid? - He's my neighbours' son. How are you? - Hi, what's your name? - Who's this guy? No one. Toke ott your shirt... Toke ott your shirt... l'm getting tired. Come on, it's so rare to see you dancing. And now, a special moment tor all you lovers and singles. Come on guys! - Shall we go? - Let's stay a bit more. ''There's a firemen's ball But a house is burning There's a firemen's ball The house has all burned down!'' Where's Julien? He must've made some new friends. He was dancing right behind us. Wake up. Calm down, your boy just needs some sleep. Sit here, there's room for two. Something's wrong? We were worried. Are you ok? l want to marry you. You're drunk my poor Julien! l've had enough, l'm leaving. l also brought your blue sweater. l've tons of them. l need light clothes, l already told you. l'm doing my best. It's not easy for me either. l'm scared... For you, for us. l'm so scared. l'm the one in jail. You're not. But don't worry, l'll manage. l need to forget, that's all. l need to forget how time flies. lt's all in my head... It's a kind of exercise. Sometimes it works. l don't even know what day it is today. Friday. Tomorrow it'll be a year. Do you forget about me sometimes? No, never. What are you doing? lt'll help you at night. l'll never get past with that. l have to go now. l put 100 euros on your canteen account. Tell me when you need more. l don't want you to lack anything. l have the day off tomorrow. l can't tomorrow. Hi Nabil. Hi, you're ok? l'm fine, thanks. How's Vincent? l think about him a lot. Those assholes refused me a visiting permit. Actually he needs a favour from you. l'm clean now. l got my papers. They need it in there. It helps them relax. l'll bring you some tomorrow. Sometimes l'm scared she'll leave. Even though l know she loves me. The problem is we don't have any kids. We wanted one but everything went so fast. Paul... We would have called him Paul. Isn't it a nice name? You know the picture of her, by the sea... You thought she was sexy, didn't you? She looks great in a swimsuit. l can show it to you again. Forget it, l've seen it a hundred times. lt's the only one l got left. You have the other one. And her perfume... lt's like a tattoo, it gets deeps into your skin and stays for ever. ''Heure Bleue'' by Guerlain. A Christmas present. lt cost me a small fortune. Sometimes she sprays some on my shirts. And most of all l love when she gets undressed. Her clothes slide down... just like that, you see. Did l tell you she wanted to be a singer? One morning she did a whole show for me. Breakfast in bed, the whole stuff... l couldn't eat a thing. Does mum work all night? - Just tonight. - Are you going out? Of course not. l'd like to live with you. What are you talking about? Go to bed. When l'm asleep l don't hear anything. lt's like being deaf. lt's been 10 minutes. Can't l touch myself a bit? Hurry up, you shouldn't be here. Don't want to suck my dick? lt would be a real help. You're not funny. l'm in a hurry. Got a date? You've got 5 minutes. Shit! Lunch time. - What's this? - Chicken. - It smells like Guerlain... - It's curry, don't like it? Your boxer. Are you kiddin? - Please take it off. - Come on... Do you have anything in there? lt helps me sleep. Turn round, hands on the wall. Don't hassle me for that, there's not even two ounces. Did she give it to you? Mind your own business. You want her to get screwed? She could be in real trouble. Get dressed now. Driving school What are you doing here? We said 6:OO pm. Leave it, l'm not here for that. Here. l don't get it. You think it's all a game? Not at all. You make me sick. Really? Big news! You've got to understand. He's my husband, l'll never let him down. Take it or leave it. - He's not here. - Who's not here? - He's not here. - Who's not here? Jean. He's not here. So what? Nothing. - What's wrong? - Nothing, l told you. Do you need anything? - Just you. - Me too. He went to visit his parents down south. Why do you keep talking about him? Because he's my buddy. He's bored here. l'm the only person he knows. All he wants is to be transferred somewhere sunny. l can understand him. What's your problem? l'm only trying to talk about something. l don't want to lose him. He makes things much easier. l have to tell you... Keep it to yourself. Alright, l'm done. Pardon me, is Jean here? Who? One of your colleagues. Who are you? Nevermind. You look like you've been up all night. Why are you looking at me like that? - Where do you think you're going? - Can l drive? You know what you're doing? What do you want? - What kind of music? - Whatever. Don't drive too fast. You could have told me about your trip. We're not married. Do you like that? You're not moaning... That feels better. Let me drive. - l'm a bad driver? - No, l'd rather drive. Do you like Vincent? Why? l just want to know. lt depends. Where are we? Did you sleep? Sort of. lt's for you. Maybe it's one size too big. That's ok. lt's very nice of you. What's with the tape recorder? lt's for Vincent. He asked me. Don't say hello? How are you? You understand? Yes. lt's too loud. l can't hear shit. Turn it down. All l hear is you. lf you get a lousy sound, don't bother. Fuck you! You're not doing it right. You go too fast. Start with some tongue work. She needs warming up. Do it as if you were me, ok? - Here. - Thanks. This butter stinks. What are you talking about? It's the fridge smell. lt's still good for a week. - Did you steal my matches? - No. Give them back to me. l told you not to play with that. - Did your boyfriend make you cry? - My boyfriend? You think l'm stupid? Even mum knows about him. - What did you tell her? - She doesn't care. What the hell did you tell her? Are you crazy or what? See my new sweater? Don't like it? You look good in it. - Did you gel your hair? - l just had a shower. The eye mask is great. l sleep like a baby. How are you? Not that good. l failed my driving test. lt's rare to pass it the 1st time. They're strict now. What did you do wrong? l ran over a dog. What are you doing here? l want you. Not here. What are you doing? l don't like you like this. Like what? Like a whore. Guess l must thank you for that. As well as Vincent. l enjoy it. Take me like this. Take me, please! Stop it. You can tell him all about it. Look at me. Look at me. Stop. Stop! What are you doing? Stay with me. - You want one? - No. l love you, Ma'it?. l really love you. Do you believe me? ls that for him or for you? Both of us. Leave him out of this. Get the tape recorder. l want him to listen. Go away! Did he give you that picture? Yes, that's how l met you. Are you ok, madam? - Get out of the car please. - What did l do? You can't sleep on the emergency lane. Your registration and insurance certificate please. My husband have them. Where is he? l don't know... He was here. Then he disappeared. Come with us please. We'll check that. Check what? l'm telling the truth. l'll go home. Please. Let me go! You have no right! Let me go! Let's go. Leave me here. l heard you bit a cop. You're out of your mind. He could have pressed charges. You're lucky. Shouldn't you feel enclosed when you're in jail? l didn't feel anything. Cut it out. You weren't in jail, only in custody. Not even a glass of water, you believe it? Why did you do that? l wanted to drive. Without any licence? Are you cold? Take my jacket. You can't stay by yourself. lt's tidy here. Not much to see anyway. l have to go. Where's the tape recorder? When will you see her? l'm asking you a question! l don't know. You don't know? We have a deal. You must go on. She's empty. All empty inside. - Which means? - You fucked her up. - l can't be here for her. - She loves you. But you shag her. That's the way it is. - l'm ending it. - What do you mean? Deal with your own problems. Cut that bullshit! - You can't let me down. - She deserves better than you. Who do you think you are? Ma'it?'s always been on my side. You're nothing. You're just a cock. A cock in a uniform. Asshole! You piece of shit! Stop it! Let go! What happened? Nothing. It's ok. Make a report. One month in the hole. He touched me up, l'll press charges! Haven't had enough? We'll back you up on the report. There won't be any report. lt'll do Julien good. And us too. You set the machine to 30, it's less hassle. l'll do one so you can see. - What does it smell of? - Him. - How gross! - Want a sniff? Stop it! Now the fabric softener. No more than one cap. l put it here. Don't mix white and colours of course. Julien told me something... That l had a lover? lt's true. l followed your advice. Why did you tell him? He saw Jean after school once and must have figured it all out. What does Jean look like? He's young, handsome, and he has a huge cock. l don't believe you. l usually hand-wash the socks. So they don't go fluffy. You're so lucky. What else? Don't bring all the food at once or they won't give him. He loves these. lt's real Russian crab. There's mayonnaise too. Want a memo? l'm not stupid. You see him often? - We broke up. - Really? No way! His clothes go two by two. Two t-shirts, two sweaters, two shirts. ls that the rule? No, it's a habit. l've never been in a prison. l'm quite scared. Now the ironing part... You just spray a little on his clothes. What am l supposed to tell him? That l needed a holiday. Can't you tell him yourself? lf l see him, l'll never leave. Did you get your visiting permit? l'll get it tomorrow. M. Giraud please? You can have it back. Where is she? l don't know. You're lying. l swear l don't know. What are you waiting for? Go after her. That's your business. l'm out. l've been transferred to Lille. l won't see you anymore? Next time l'll really top myself. You've got to hang on. You should have made a baby with her. ln winter we'll travel in a pink carriage! Full of blue cushions! ln winter we'll travel in a blue carriage! - Full of pink... - You're driving me crazy! Want me to whip you? Come on! Last ride, l'm warning you. l'm no donkey. - Now go on. - We're not high enough! l've had enough of this. Julien! Wait! Hi. Djamila's really got some nerve. She told me right away. She should mind her own business. She's jealous of us. ''Us'' what? There's no such thing as ''us''. l'm being transferred to Lille anyway. Really? lt's better like that. l thought you needed sun. We're in the sun right here. Did you see Vincent? Yes. How is he? He tried to commit suicide. He's out of danger now. He only has himself to blame. No, it's because l left. He was scared you'd leave for good. l wish l could. l can't forget him. l think of him all the time. Your hand is cold. Did he ask you to come here? No, l needed to see you one last time. Thank you. Jean! Wait! l need to ask you something. Did he tell you why he's in jail? l never saw his record. It doesn't matter to me.
