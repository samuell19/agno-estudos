Fine but Not Great Bye, my love. Mom... I don't want to go to Turin. Mom? Mom? Hey, Mom! Turin is beautiful! Do you remember your first day of kindergarten? You didn't want to go. You eventually liked it so much you didn't want to come home on the last day. Think of Turin as a kindergarten. It has a shitty climate, though. Don't worry; I'll bring Dad back to you soon. As soon as we sort things out, we'll come back. Make him eat. He loses weight easily. He looks thin, but he isn't! Will you make him pasta frittata? Of course. I'm going to miss you. Don't worry; Mom will always be there. Go now, or he'll worry. I've sent my CV to the shopping mall, Candida. But so have all the people in Terrasini who would like to work there. With so many university graduates around, do you think they'll hire your Dad? I'm almost 50. In this country, graduates are reduced to working as labourers, delivery men and butchers. I'm a real butcher. What could I do? Why should I go to school, then? Why should I study? Uncle Vito told me of this job opportunity. If I don't take it now, someone else will, so... We can go. Don't worry. I get what you're saying. Maybe we'll even like Turin. Besides, Shade lives in Turin. He's my idol. Maybe fate wants us to meet. We'll get married. Who the fuck is Shade? Anyway, it won't be forever. We'll come back to Mom someday. Vito! How are you? My beauty! Come, come! Come, Salvo. - Good evening. - Hello. Hi. Excuse me, Sir... He's Salvo, my cousin, and this is Candida, his daughter. Do you remember the conversation we had a few days ago? I'd set them up upstairs. - Go, go! You're making me lose count! - Thank you. Come, Salvo. Good evening. Hey, Vito, you haven't changed at all in 15 years! - Except you don't speak Sicilian anymore. - People speak Italian in Turin. This is the apartment. Here are some jarred tomatoes, olives, water bottles, flour, tuna, pickles, pasta... Here's the kitchen. There's some frozen food in the fridge. Tomatoes... The "apartment"... Where are the beds, Vito? The "beds"? The bed. It's here, behind the water bottle crates. You pull it down, and then you make it. Basically, this is the restaurant's storage room. Yes, Salvo. I couldn't find a better accommodation for your budget. Have a little patience. "Home & store". - Let's say it's just a "store". - Christ, Salvo, don't... Hey, don't worry. It's great! We won't even need to buy groceries! Candida, let's be clear: you must not touch any of this stuff. It's important. Vito, she's not a little girl. She knows that! Salvo, I'm risking my job here. - Don't embarrass me. - OK, Vito. OK. Kiss Uncle Vito goodnight. - Bye, Uncle. - Bye. - Bye, Salvo. Good night. - Bye, and thanks. Let's get ready. - Oh, Salvo... - What? You have to pull the bed back up at 9 a.m., or it'll be in the way of other staff members. - OK, Vito. Thanks. - Good night. Thanks. Come on. Don't break anything, or Uncle Vito will come upstairs again. Don't hurt yourself, OK? Don't hurt yourself. Candida? Candida! - Hey, Candida! - What? - What are you doing, sleeping? - Isn't it normal that I'm sleeping? I just wanted to know... Is it all right? - Yes. - Aren't you worried about tomorrow? Me? Worried? No way! I mean, about the new school in Turin. All those rich, loaded, cool kids, while you are... "new". I hardly think they're cooler than me. Sleep, now, and stop bothering me. Good night. If you're uncomfortable, just tell me, and I'll move aside! Good night. We're all set... Hi. Nice to meet you. I'm Candida Morvillo, and I'm from Terrasini. Do you know where it is? Shall I tell you? It's in Sicily. Starting today, I'll go to school here. Can I sit next to you? I take it as a "No". Maybe this desk is already taken. Bye. - What a bore! - Hi. Nice to meet you. I'm Candida Morvillo, and I'm from Terrasini. Starting today, I'll go to school here. Candida "Morbillo" ("measles")? I've never heard a name with so many diseases in it! What's your vaccination status, guys? You can't sit here. This is my desk. No problem. I'll move to another desk. It's a pity, though, because I've never seen a boy as cute as you in Terrasini. You can't sit there, either. It's Niccol?'s desk. I'll move again. Cosimo, can she sit there? Let me think... No. I'll move again. Gosh! It's the first day, and you've already made me a teacher! Thank you! Shall I call the roll? Good morning. Good morning, Miss. I'm Candida Morvillo, and I'm from Terrasini. - It's in Sicily. - Why are you sitting there? There are no seats available, so I'm sitting here. I see well 3 seats available. Who are you kidding, Morvillo? What a fine start! "Fine but not great" (title of an Italian song) Come on, don't waste my time. Go to your seat. Your homework is due today, guys. What a pity! I was so comfortable at the teacher's desk! - Hi! What are you doing here? - Hi, darling. I had a free half-hour. I thought: "I should pick Candida up on her first day of school in Turin". - Thanks! - How did it go? Very well. They are all nice and kind. Except him. He didn't deign to say a word to me, today. Of course. He has a chauffeur, a car... The more money one has, the less one talks. - There must be a problem, then. - What problem? You don't talk much, either, but you're poor. Candida! It's my lifestyle! Stop it! - Good morning. - Good morning. Don't prepare my lunch. I'll eat something at the restaurant with Uncle Vito. It's not for you. I'm taking it to my classmates. It's the second day, and you already want to make an asshole of yourself? You can't sell food during recess, Candida! We're not in Sicily. We're in Turin! They'll say: "Look at those southerners!" I'm talking to you and you're walking away! Candida! I made some pasta frittata, with fried aubergines, garlic, pepper and cheese. If anyone wants some... - I'll have a slice. - So will I. - Here you are. - Hey, bro, don't you want a bite? No. - Thanks. - You're welcome. - You said you wanted some. - Yes, please. Thank you. Delicious! Come on, guys, let's go. Here. This is for you. Do you know Shade? Never mind... Eat it, it's good. - Look how many likes I got for this photo with my new sweatshirt on. - 800 likes! A like for every euro I paid for it. Today I'm wearing 2,000 euros' worth of clothes. - What about you, "Morbillo"? - I'm wearing 53 euros' worth of clothes. I bought my shoes, jeans and fur jacket from Giuseppe's stand in Terrasini. - Is Instagram available in Sicily? - Of course it's available. The watch of that boy who draws the Egyptians all the time, is worth more than your clothes. - Tutankhamun's watch is really beautiful. - I wasn't talking to you. Steal the ball! - Where's Jacopo? - I don't know. - We wrote it in large letters! - Giant letters! - Where are you going? - To the bathroom. - Couldn't you have gone earlier? - I need to go now. Come on, hurry up! Jacopo, what are you doing here? If you can't play, don't beat yourself up. I can't play either. Come with me. Come on, we'll keep each other company. I know you like me. It's obvious, even if you won't say it. Those assholes of Cosimo and Niccol? did this to you, didn't they? Jacopo, you can't let them win! Do you know what you have to do? You have to go out there, with me. Without that thing on your face, of course. Shall we wash it off? - Where's Jacopo? - I don't see him. He hasn't got in the game yet. It's almost over. Don't start, please. There he is. He has deigned to show up, at last. - Good. Now Jacopo can get in the game. - What are you saying! - One of you two has to play. - I can't. I don't even know the rules. - Can't someone else play? - They all fouled out. You play, "Morbillo". "Tutankhamun" is shitting himself. Jacopo isn't shitting himself. And he knows the rules. Come on, Morvillo. Just a few seconds. - Are you shitting yourself, too? - I'm not shitting myself. - I paid for the team's uniforms, and they're letting that fatso play instead of Jacopo! - Shh! That jersey doesn't even fit her! She's not overweight. It's just that the jersey is too small. Luca! Niccol?! - What did I say? The fatso doesn't even know the rules. - Let's see. She can't learn all the rules at once. Besides, she's not a fatso. She's "differently thin". Go, Niccol?! Home: 47 - Guest: 49 Shoot it! - Shoot it! - Shoot it! She's scored! Home: 50 - Guest: 49 - She's scored a "goal"! - The correct term is "basket". - What? - "Basket". A "goal"! Way to go! - She's my daughter! - She's his daughter... I'm leaving. I have 32 shopping malls to run! What a good girl! We've made it! Way to go! We're first in the championship, thanks to our fatso! Let's all celebrate tonight, OK? No. I'm not going to celebrate with you, tonight. - I don't like what you did to Jacopo. - We were just joking. - We didn't do anything wrong to "Tutankhamun". - You don't get it, do you? It hurts his feelings when you don't invite him to play basketball with you, or you hang out together without him. Should I hang out with "Tutankhamun"? He doesn't talk, or move. He draws pyramids and mummies all the time. - Maybe because he's a mummy, too! - If you haven't figured it out yet... - Jacopo is not totally normal. - He's half autistic. - You're not helping him, though. - She's new but she's already a pain in the ass. Jacopo! Jacopo! I didn't know you were an... "autista" ("driver"). You're good. Not everyone is able to drive at 15. You're special! Thanks. See? You can talk. Now that you're talking, can I ask you something? You bought your driver's license, didn't you? Do you want a ride? OK. Thanks. - It was amazing, Mom! She made a shot from beyond half-court! - I saw it. It seemed that the ball would miss the basket, but it went in, and we won! Then everyone carried her shoulder high, in triumph, as if she had been a Pharaoh. The other day, she brought pasta frittata for everyone. For me, too! - So you made that thing he ate the other day. - Yes. - So you ate it. - Yes; the Brie cheese in it was good. What's Brie cheese? That was "Caciucavaddu" cheese from Terrasini. - What? - "Caciucavaddu" (Sicilian for "Caciocavallo"). - "Caciucavaddu". - "Caciuca..." - "Caciucavaddu". - "Caciucavaddu". - What a strange name! - Hi. I'm home. - Hi, Vittorio. - Jacopo, come and say hello to your dad. - She's Candida. - Hello. I'm Jacopo's friend. Jacopo's friend... Did you see what she did at the game? I know who she is. Yes, I saw that. Did you do your homework? It was amazing. With only a few seconds left... Jacopo, please. I saw that, I said. There's no need to tell me 100 times. - What's the matter? - Nothing. I've made a snack for the kids. - Go and have a snack. - Go. What's the... - Who's this girl? - Please, Vittorio. The one time he has a friend... - The one time he has a friend, does she have to be like that? - What do you mean? Like that. - I'm off, Salvo. - See you tomorrow. I'll help Dad, don't worry. Dad, they have a wonderful house! They also have a basketball court, a swimming pool, and a sitting room that is larger than this pizzeria. And a cook who will make anything you want. They have everything but Caciocavallo cheese. And do they want you to go there every afternoon? - Yes. His mom asked me to go. - Did his dad ask you to go, too? Yes. Jacopo and I have become best friends. - Jacopo, the boy who doesn't talk. - The boy who wouldn't talk. He talks a lot, now! Now we sit next to each other in class. I was thinking... We could invite them all here for dinner, Jacopo, his father and his mother. Invite them. But I don't think people like them will come to eat here, in a pizzeria. They are used to going to other places. Anyway, go ahead, invite them. Jacopo will come. - How about going out later? - OK. - Where are we going? - We'll see. I don't understand this; let me copy it. Hey, give it back! - Let me see it. - No! Give it back! Come on, give it back! Start with the right foot. Left foot. Now step back. Same movement. Right foot. Left foot. 1... 2... 3... 4. Right. Let's try to do all the steps together. 1... 2... 3... 4. Go! Do them! Now... go. Right foot. Left foot. This movement should be slower. Look carefully. No! Give it back! (indistinct dialogue) Give it back! - Do you want to go to a place? - What place? A place... It's a surprise. What place? I'm waiting! (jokingly) Do you know what that tiny dot down there is? It's Terrasini! - Will you take me there sometime? - Of course! Let's take a picture together. From "Terrasini"! Do you know I'm a stylist? - When will it be? - Next month. A night to go to Sicily, and a night to come back here. The memorial service for Maria will be held in the morning. - No, Salvo, it's too much time. - Just two days, Vito. How do I tell the boss? He's just hired you, and you already want to take two vacation days! "Vacation"?! Can't you do it all in one day? - I'd have to go by plane. - Go by plane, then. Do you know how much the airfare is for me and Candida? 500 euros! I'm sorry, Salvo. I can't help you. I'd get into trouble. - Vito... - Salvo, it can't be done! Come on, let's go. And clear the table! - Where's Jacopo? - He's out with Candida. Again? He's always with Candida. Are they at least doing their homework? Yes, they are. - And you're OK with that? - No, I'm not "OK". See? I'm happy. He finally lives like any kid of his age. Anyway, we've discussed this. Are you not suspicious? Don't you think some interests may lie behind her friendship? I can't believe you only care about money. - I don't only care about money. - Yes, you only care about money. - You're too trusting, Luisa. - Yeah... Jacopo? - Jacopo, is it all right? - It's all right, Mom. Dad? Dad! - Hey, Dad! - What is it, Candida? - Can I ask you something? - No. Ask me tomorrow. No, now! - Can I work with Uncle Vito, too? - No, Candida. Come on! We'd earn more money, and we'd be able to do more things. You have to study, Candida. Study. You're stubborn. You said university graduates, nowadays, work as waiters. - I might as well expedite things. - Forget it! Forget it, Candida! You have to study, for fuck's sake! You have to study and sleep. One needs to study and sleep. Sleep. I'll bring him back to you. I promise, Mom. Good night. This is when I cut his sweatshirt. He looks like the Incredible Hulk! Hey, play the part where we cut Tutankhamun's bandages. Guys... Why are you so shocked? It can also be worn open. Hi, sweeties. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Excuse me, I've heard you're looking for a dog-sitter. Come on. Let's go. Come on! Let's go! We'll study at my place and then go to the Egyptian Museum. I have to do something first. I'll meet you there. - What do you have to do? - "Something". - OK, but don't be late. - OK. - You've been late recently. - OK, don't worry. - See you later. - Bye. Academy of Sciences - Egyptian Museum - Look: he's back! - Candida! - Sweetheart... - This money is well deserved! - Thanks a lot. Thanks. Goodbye. Candida, I'm waiting for you at the Egyptian Museum. Where are you? Who am I? - It's about time! - Sorry. I had some things to do. - Let's go in. - It's 6 p.m.. It's too late. No, it's not too late. I don't understand why this shop closes at 6 p.m.. They're all dead. Closing early doesn't make any difference to them. - It's not a "shop". It's a museum. - How pedantic you are! This is the oldest Egyptian Museum in the world. It was founded in 1824. It is second only to the one in Cairo. There are about 6,500 artefacts on show, and another 26,000 in its warehouse. That's a mummy, and that's how the Egyptians preserved bodies 3,000 years ago. - How did they do it? - They were true masters. They used some hooks to remove the brain through the nostrils. - The internal organs were removed through a cut in the abdomen. - Cool! They left only the heart in place, because they believed it was the home of the soul. "The Egyptian Museum is closing." They say masks and mummies come to life at night. - You've seen too many movies! - Let's see. Let's stay here. - "Here"... for the night, you mean? - Yes. - Are you sure? - Yes. OK. "The Egyptian Museum is closing." Shh! Come with me. - Let's hide in the Temple of Anubis. - "Anu"... what? Shh! "The Egyptian Museum is closing." We're in the Egyptian Museum at night! Alone! Yes, and I'm a little scared. Look, this is the goddess Sekhmet. Half woman, half lioness. She's portrayed in various positions. Here, she's sitting on her throne. In these other statues, she's standing. She wears a sort of crown, which indicates she's a goddess. Nice... Come. I want to show you something. - What? - You'll see. Look: he's Tutankhamun. Why do they call you that? He looks nothing like you. He's sad. He looks more like my father, to be honest. He's handsome, though. I like him. And... Jacopo, where are you? Jacopo! Ah... - Wait! - What is it? This statue... just moved! You fool! What's so funny? - What did you do, Candida? - I was just taking a picture of the ram. We're sorry, Director. It was an accident. We just happened to be there, and we got locked in. See, Vittorio? It was an accident. - Are you sure that's what happened? - Yes. And you call this "an accident"? What were you up to? Jacopo... answer, say something! I apologize on behalf of my daughter for what happened. She surely didn't mean to do anything wrong. They wanted to do something nice, something "cultural". Maybe next time you should try to respect the opening hours. "Something cultural"! Come on, Luisa, let's go. Come on, Jacopo! - Thank you very much indeed. - I apologize again, Director. Your father will fix everything. Besides, your mother is a very good person; it shows. She reminds me so much of mine. But she's a little thinner, of course. I'm sorry for my husband's impetuosity. He's very protective. I don't want him to give you the wrong impression. You don't need to explain. I don't know what to do about Candida. She won't listen to me. She has a mind of her own. When my wife was still alive, she knew how to talk to her. But I can't manage her behaviour. - Candida doesn't have a mom anymore... - No. Soon it will be two years since she died. I'm sorry. I didn't know that. I'll talk to my husband, and I'll try to calm him down. I'll talk to Candida. I'll try to tell her not to screw up... oops... - ...not to do these silly things again. - I got it. Give my regards to your husband. How fucking embarrassing, Candida! You embarrassed me in front of his father, the museum's director... I'm sure staying inside the museum was your idea. You don't know what's in there. There are statues and mummies that date to 3,000 years ago. It's wonderful! He told me, in a marvellous way, that they wrapped dead people in bandages, and they used some hooks to remove the brain through the nose. Gosh, Candida! I don't like her! I don't like her! Look what's happened! Jacopo has got involved in these thuggish activities! Luisa, he deserves better friendships! "Better friendships"? Do you hear yourself, Vittorio? Don't you see how happy he has been since he found a friend? You think about his happiness now. I think long-term. I'm worried about him. You should care more about not treating him like your mother used to treat you. - What's my mother got to do with this? - You're acting just like her. You should let him make his choices. That's what parents do. Yes, that's what parents do, only to find their children hanging out with people like that. What's the worst that could happen? That he makes a mistake? "You learn by your mistakes." That's how things work. What can he learn by hanging out with the daughter of a pizza-maker? I'm curious. The "daughter of a pizza-maker" has lost her mom. Candida has lost her mom. Do you realize how much fortitude she must find every day? That should be enough for you to understand that Jacopo has a lot to learn from her. - They didn't remove the heart, though. - Thank God! They believed it was the mirror... - the mirror of something. - I see. - So your interests have switched from Shed... - "Shade". - What? - "Shade". ...from him to the Egyptian Museum. That's an improvement! Listen, Luisa: we'll do as you say. But let me be clear: if that girl embarrasses us again, or if something even worse happens, we're done with her. Nothing will happen, Vittorio. Nothing. Do you trust me? Trust me. OK. Let's go to bed. Candida? Hey, Candida! I'm going to the market to buy some groceries with Uncle Vito. Get up in 10 minutes, or you'll be late for school. Bye. No! "On 8 May, Shade will meet his fans in Turin" Good morning, Miss. Take your time, Morvillo. It's just the third time you've been late this week. - Candida! Candida! - What is it? - The autograph session starts at 5 p.m.. - I know. I'll meet you there. Bye. Come on, let's go. Look, look! Come. Come here. Wait. Come here. Fetch the ball! Come on, let's go. Big boy! Let me give you a kiss! - Thanks! It's great! - Thank you. - I'll sign them all, guys. - When will the next album be out? - You're great, Shade! - Thanks a lot. - My name is Clara. - I'll be right with you. - Can you sign mine, too? - Sure. Excuse me. My friend is over there. Move over. My friend, Jacopo, is over there. Hi. Sorry, I'm late. What smells like dog? Jesus Christ! Morvillo, get out of here! You smell like dog. Gosh, Morvillo! Did you sleep in a dog pound? Hey, take a bath! Excuse me a second, guys. What a stink! - You didn't give me your autograph. - Sorry. Sorry. You idiot! Idiot! How are you? - Fine. - But not great! - Do I really smell so bad? - Not so bad, for not being a dog. If you were trying to be funny, you failed. It's not my fault. I spent three hours walking a giant dog. Why? I'm dog-sitting. I need 500 euros to go to Sicily. - For my mother's memorial service. - I'll give you the money. No. I have my credit card on me. I'll give you the money, trust me. Luisa, we're all going to the pizzeria, tonight. Thank you. Dad, they are here. Hi, Jacopo! - Mrs. Luisa, Sir... - Good evening. Welcome. We've reserved the best table for you. Thanks. - Mr. Barberis... - I'll get the menus. - Don't leave. - I have to. - Sit down. - I can't. - Sit down, please. - What's going on? Oh, I know what's going on! This has to stop. - I work here, Sir. - I won't waste your time. Just two minutes. I want to show you something about your daughter. Look. Do you know what this is? No, I don't. My son's credit card statement. The card is in his name, but I obviously receive the statements. Today I found a charge for 500 euros, for two air tickets. Jacopo! Where did you two want to go with these tickets? Where did you want to take my son? - Where did you want to go? - Let them answer! - To Amsterdam, maybe, to smoke some joints? - Come on, Vittorio, they're just kids! So? "Amsterdam"? "Joints"? No, to Sicily, to attend... To Sicily? Sicily is even worse. What did you want to do there? Be with your buddies? You pretend to be his friend only to take advantage of us and do whatever you like. Please... And I guess this was just the beginning. How much more money did you want to worm out of us? - Don't you dare say such things. - Just be thankful that I'm not reporting you. These air tickets have been cancelled, of course. Let's go. And I don't want your daughter to get near my son again. Am I clear? - Come on, let's go! - Yes, we're going, Vittorio. Jacopo, say goodbye, and let's go. Goodbye, everyone. Salvo... - Salvo, what are you doing, sitting there? Get a move on! - Yes, Vito. You have to explain this to me, Candida. We'll talk later. Don't you think you overreacted a little? I don't even want to guess what she was planning to do in Sicily. - She wanted to go to her mom's memorial service. - I don't care. The end doesn't justify the means. You must not see that girl again! "Her mother's memorial service"... That's crazy! What were you thinking, doing something like that, Candida? Taking that boy's money! - I didn't take it. He lent it to me. I was going to give it back to him. - How? - How were you going to give it back to him? - I'm working as a dog-sitter after school. - As a... what? - As a dog-sitter. What the fuck is a "dog-sitter"? - I'm walking other people's dogs. - Are you fucking kidding me? Look at me! No. It's just that I couldn't save up for Mom's memorial service. So you're working. - I told you not to work, didn't I? - Yes. I heard you talking to Vito. I wanted to go to Sicily. We're not going to Sicily. We're not going, Candida! We'll hold Mom's memorial service here. - But... - No but's! I didn't bring you to Turin to walk other people's dogs. Don't you understand, Candida? Try to understand that, at least. So it's true: you're a thief. I've caught you, haven't I? I know you're a good girl. Forget about those people. They're rich, spoiled and very prejudiced. I don't envy your friend, Jacopo, who has a father like that. Do you know who he reminds me of? The restaurant's owner. I always answer: "Yes", "Certainly", "Yessir". I always bow my head, but he doesn't even look at me. Do you believe that I think he's better than me? He's not better than me. It's just that life, here, is more difficult for us. We have to be stronger. Are you strong? Yes. And those three assholes who make fun of you at school... They're not going anywhere. But you'll go far. And know that, if you need anything, Uncle Vito will always be there for you. Uncle... do you know Shade? Scialpi (Italian singer)? Is he still alive? No, "Shade"! Who the fuck is "Shade"? Have you done your homework? You knew I'd test some of you today. No excuses. If there are no volunteers, I'll choose whom to test. Physics, Maths, Chemistry, History... Excuse me, where's my desk? And here we thought you had eaten it! Jacopo, where's my desk? You don't really believe what your father said, do you? Jacopo, look at me. I'm not interested in your money! Morvillo, leave Barberis alone. Your desk is there, now. - The lovebirds have broken up! - Ossani! - The sweethearts don't want to sit next to each other anymore. - Stop it! This is what happens when a wife wants her husband's money. Stop it, Ossani, or you'll get a demerit! That's enough! - Fuck you, asshole! - Did you see that? No, I didn't see anything. Go and sit down, now. Sit down, everyone. Get out your books and let's start. Let's not waste time; as I said, I'm going to test you today. Page 32. Hello? No, I'm not dog-sitting anymore. I'm sorry. No, not even for 2 hours. Why? Because my father doesn't want me to. OK... I'll see you in Piazza Vittorio. Hi! How beautiful you are! - You were at the autograph session. - Oh my God! Shade, is that you? Yes. I have all your photos and your poster at home. - Hi. - Hi. Now I know why you smelled like dog, last time. - Last time... when? - At my autograph session. Your autograph session... - Do you remember me? - Of course. You got more famous than me, for a minute. - You're so young and you're already working. - That's why my dad doesn't want me to work. - It was a temporary job to go to my mother in Sicily. - I see. - Let's go. You walk him, so he'll get used to you. - Thanks. - What's his name? - Puni Taro. But I just call him Puni. - And Taro is his surname? - Yes, something like that! Oh my God, I still can't believe it! Dear Salvo and Candida, and all her friends and relatives, we want to commemorate Maria in an informal way, with our friendship and with our prayers. We want to remember her for her joy of living, in her role of wife and mother, and for her passions, typical of a young woman. Jesus said: "You have faith in God; have faith also in me. "In my Father?s house are many dwelling places. "I am going to prepare a place for you." The house Jesus mentions, makes us think of our own. Our mom is our house. Her support is her love. Now, without her, the house will seem desolate, empty. But, even when our mom dies suddenly, she stays inside us and tells us: "Don't cry for me. Live. Fight for everything you believe in, "against all odds. "In the meanwhile, I'm going to prepare a place for you. A safe place." The priest is right: you mustn't cry for me. See? It doesn't matter whether you are in Terrasini or Turin. I'll always be there. I know, Mom. But I really wanted to go to Terrasini. But that's not what is important. Look at you: you're getting prettier every day. And stronger. And all you've done for Jacopo, makes me really proud of you. Dad is proud of you, too. It's just that he doesn't know how to say it. He never smiles. No, he smiles inside himself. Everything's going to be OK, you'll see. Hey, what's Shade like in person? - Is he cute? - Yes. That's how you should take life. With a smile. You're just like your mom. Except you're alive! - What is it? - Open it. Your birthday is in a week, isn't it? I'm thinking of throwing a nice party with all your friends. It's useless. Nobody will come, just like last year. Why do you say it will be like last year? You've changed since last year. You have to try, Jacopo. You have to do it for yourself. And, above all, you don't have to be afraid of them. I know what's going on at school. Or, at least, I can imagine it. Maybe some mothers would have handled this differently, they would have intervened. But I'm not that kind of mother, because I have faith in you, and I know you can do it on your own. Besides, we are children only once, and for such a short time that... not trying to be happy is really a waste. Are you happy, Mom? Only if you are. Thanks for the invitation! He's invited us to his birthday party! How kind of him! - We'll certainly go, won't we, guys? - Of course! - Definitely! Like every year! - What a loser! - Niccol?, don't leave your invitation there! - No! I can't go to the party without it! What a loser Barberis is! You told him you'd go, so you must go. We were joking. Every year we say we'll go, but we never go. Do you enjoy doing that to him? What the fuck is it to you, "Morbillo"? You haven't even been invited. I'm sorry for Jacopo. That's really mean of you. OK, I challenge you to a football match, or a basketball game, or a wrestling match. If you win, we'll go to the party. If I win, nobody will go. It's too easy for you. I'm just a southern, chubby girl. You beat me at everything. Let's do another challenge, then, that even a fatso like you can do. - What? - Let's meet on the tracks of the Regional Rail, tonight. She won't have the courage to lie on the tracks. Let's hope not, or she'll derail the train! What an asshole! "Why are they doing this? "I didn't do anything. I don't talk to them. I avoid them. But it's no use. "Maybe I should stand up to them, and shout 'Enough!', "but then they may harass me even more. "Now I'm not afraid anymore. You're afraid of what you don't know. "I know who they are, what they tell me, "and I'm just tired, like after a race to finish first. Too tired. "They should be my classmates, but they see me as an enemy, for no reason. "I'm tired of their words, their pushes, their kicks, their laughs. "So I'm leaving. Who is going to notice that I'm gone, "that I'm no longer responding 'Present', that my seat is empty? "This way, I haven't lost, and they haven't won." - Why are you doing that? - What do you mean? Do you know who wrote this letter? No, you don't, because you don't give a fuck. - Jacopo wrote it. - Ah, your friend "Tutankhamun"! Shut up, I'm talking! You've had plenty of time to talk. There are kids dying every day because of people like you. Take these. Come on, share them with them. - Who is this boy? - His name is Fabio. He jumped off a balcony some time ago, because he had some assholes like you three in his class. Or, at least, an asshole like you. Is this girl... Yes, Niccol?, she's dead, too, if that was your question. Everyone in these pictures is dead. Some kids slit their wrists, or throw themselves under a train, or jump off a balcony. They know why they want to die: they're tired, they can't take it anymore. I just pity you. Or rather, I feel a little sad for you. You must have a great pain inside to do what you're doing. And I'm a little sorry for you. Ossani, nobody ever wins in these things. About this challenge... You do it. I prefer to be happy. Is it all right? Hi. This is Candida. Sorry to bother you. Can I ask you a little favour? I knew they wouldn't come. Mr. Barberis, your guests are here. See? Hi. See? He doesn't need that girl to be popular with his classmates. If anything, dumping her has done him good. Jacopo is just like me: we don't need anyone. That's Shade. - You're Shade! - Surprise! - You're Jacopo... Happy birthday! - Thanks a lot. Where's Candida? I wouldn't be so sure about that. No, my friend. I said: "No, absolutely not." Don't make me repeat things 100 times. Talk to you later. I'll call you back later. Bye. Mr. Barberis, I didn't do anything, this time, I swear! Our Candida... My wife and I are really grateful for what you've done for Jacopo. We'd like to reward you for your great generosity. - We'd like to give you a nice present. - No, thanks. There must be something you would like. Nobody can give me what I want. Tell us what it is. I'd like to move back to Terrasini, and live in my house, near the sea. With my friends. Near my mother. My father lost his job because they opened a big shopping mall there, - and he had to close his deli. - They opened a big mall... Yes, a huge and beautiful one. I told him: "Send them your CV." But he said that they don't hire 50-year-olds. - The mall doesn't hire them... - No. - So this is your house. - Yes. - It's pretty nice. - Thanks. And thanks a lot for coming. Don't mention it; my pleasure. It was Candida who made me discover your music. - Do you like it? - Yes, very much. I'm pleased. I'm glad. Who am I? Thank you for coming. I love you. Happy birthday. Now that Candida is here, I guess the party can start. # Press "Play", no, "Pause" # Life is now, life is nausea # Today I'm out of it; I got back at 3 a.m., and I entered the wrong house # They're asking me: "How's life? Are you going on holiday?" # Bro, this girl is so annoying; she's sent me a photo and I've run out of data # I've been at this party for an hour There's so much dope here... # that they didn't put the drug in my glass, they put my glass in the drug # I'm looking for a job but I went to art high school # Fine, but not great # She said: "You're ugly, but you're so nice" # Fine, but not great # While I was saving my files, my PC rebooted # Fine, but not great # If you ask me how I am # I'm fine, but not great # Fine, but not great # She says she's going on a mystical journey, only to have sex with the whole tourist resort # If you ask me how I am # I'm fine, but not great # Fine, but not great I'm going out; it's summer, it's very hot, I'm very anxious # If you ask me how I am... # They told me to be careful, but I didn't listen to them # This girl has a thick accent; not even the translation app can understand her # If you don't answer or move, I won't be responsible for my actions # You told me to go to hell, but the queue of sinners is too long, I can't enter # She wants us to go out for dinner, but she's playing hard to get # I don't give a fuck about her; I just want to go out for a drink # I'm looking for a job but I went to art high school # Fine, but not great # She said: "You're ugly, but you're so nice" # Fine, but not great # On FB, she wrote: "Have a great day" # Fine, but not great # If you ask me how I am... # I'm fine, but not great # Fine, but not great # She says she's going on a mystical journey, only to have sex with the whole tourist resort # If you ask me how I am # I'm fine, but not great # Fine, but not great I'm going out; it's summer, it's very hot, I'm very anxious # If you ask me how I am... Jacopo, wake up. We have many things to do. It's already 10 a.m.. Ten more minutes... "Ten more minutes"?! - Wake up, will you? - Stop it! # If I'm being honest, # you shouldn't have told me "You're a zero", # without even looking at me # I don't see the glass as half full or half empty; it's always empty # It's the truth If you ask me how I am... Hi, Mom. He's Jacopo, my best friend. It's all thanks to him that we've moved back here. Sorry. Wait, I have to do something. What? Where are you going? See? What did I say? Everything has worked out well. Thanks, Mom. You're the best dead mom in the world. I know. You're good, too. Hey, you're not going to marry a northerner, are you? Don't worry; I love only Shade. Hmm... Done. Thanks, Jacopo. - This is my "swimming pool". - It's beautiful. It's even larger than mine! I come here when I want to feel alive. Do you miss your mom? I miss her a lot. But when I want to feel her near me, I look at the sky, the sea... Besides, I'm not alone. I have my father and my friends. They're part of my family, too. You're part of it, too, now. I hope we'll be friends forever. Of course we will. What would you do without me? - I'm going to miss you a lot. - I'm going to miss you a lot, too. When you think about me, look at the sky. The sky is the same everywhere. - We all come from there. Even the ancient Egyptians knew it, right? - Right. ...a nice playground, a stage area for artists and singers, and next month we'll open a new gallery. A new gallery. Ah. Where's the supermarket? I want to see the supermarket. - Certainly. Come. - Thanks. When you slice the ham, wrap it in plastic wrap. - Bye, Mr. Barberis. - Bye. Mrs. Luisa, Sir... Good morning! What a pleasure! How are you? - Very well, thank you. - Is it all right? It's all right. Thanks. We're inviting you to dinner in our hotel tonight. That's very kind of you. Tomorrow night you'll be our guests, then. Thanks! - After all, we're almost related now. - In what sense? Vittorio... Ah, in that sense... - Be on time. - Absolutely. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Well, we were right to hire Salvo. Yes! This way, we've got rid of him and his daughter. Vittorio! I love you so much. I love you, too. English subtitles by YRR
