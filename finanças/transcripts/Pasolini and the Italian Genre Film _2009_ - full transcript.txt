I met Pasolini when he was a screenwriter. A while after that, he was desperate because he had an agreement with Fellini to make the film which became Accattone. Then when they were about to start Fellini said: "No..." "I've seen the tests you did, I don't like them." And Pasolini was desperate. He wanted to throw himself down the steps at San Sebastianello! Bolognini called me and said: "Look, Pasolini's desperate, he wants to throw himself down the steps at San Sebastianello." I said: "What the hell? Wait, he can jump tomorrow if he wants to." Then he came and showed me what he had filmed. And really, it was bullshit. I mean, he'd filmed like a kid filming his aunt's wedding. It wasn't that he didn't know - he knew exactly what he wanted to say. He didn't know how it was done. It's like with me, I know what flying is, but make me pilot an airplane and I'll crash it. But I said: "Let's see..." It was a strange relationship. I was younger than him - well, four years younger. But he treated me as though I was his grandfather or his father. A strange relationship. I would often wonder about it. But it was - I wouldn't say a filial relationship, but... Maybe also because I'd noticed that he didn't have a good relationship with his father. Pasolini was an auteur, a genius who knew what to say. Once he'd learnt the technical stuff, which is easy, after that it was no problem. After Accattone, he did all his films with me. I made eight films with Pasolini. I didn't just stop for no reason, with The Decameron. It wasn't that things weren't going well anymore. On the contrary, at that time his films were selling better, whereas before I had to force Pasolini on the distributors. But it started with The Decameron. He was being shady. I'd done the location scouting. Then, with a treacherous friend of his, he sold everything to Grimaldi. But I'd done everything in The Decameron. I only work on films I like. Whether Pasolini had the idea or I did... I like making films that are good. It's difficult for someone to... If someone suggests an intelligent project, I won't turn it down. But usually, no, that's not how it works. No, it was planned. In the programme for making films, I said: "Let's do the Decameron, great!" It's a shame, because there was no need to betray me. When we'd done eight films together. I told him he was a bastard, but... There you go. After that, everything started to go downhill for him. So betrayal doesn't pay much. No-one remembers Judas. And yet... When Pasolini came to the Trilogy of Life he granted himself, for one last time, an illusion of possible innocence. Of the humanity of bodies above all. Of bodies, of sensuality. In fact it's no accident that he chooses literary classics, thus taking back in time a humanity that could not yet experience the reification which is the constant object of Pasolini's critique, including during his previous phase of elitist cinema. It's a sudden, decisive change of direction, because he's going from a type of cinema that is essentially cryptic, which uses a sort of maieutics to draw on the emancipated proletariat - you could still talk in such terms in those days, now it would be laughable. Before Pasolini starts to say that nothing of all this remains in post-history: social classes have been completely dissolved, and that innocence is no longer possible - he grants himself a moment of lightness, that's how he often defines it. A moment of lightness, meaning a return to the joy of sensuality. More than of sexuality. Sexuality is treated with this sinful undertone, which then spawned an infinite number of sub genres, all focusing on this one single aspect - an aspect which does exist in Pasolini's Trilogy of Life. The Decameron, The Canterbury Tales and Arabian Nights are indeed all centered on sexuality. But they center on the innocence of sexuality, and on returning this "empty-eyed youth", which he was already talking about, to a free enjoyment of its sensual life. The first time I saw Pasolini's Decameron, I was carrying a huge burden of criticisms and opinions about this erotic film. And I was expecting - I didn't understand why Pier Paolo had wanted to make a commercial film. I thought this eroticism was to be a vehicle to create a scandal, which would translate into success at the box office. And when the lights came on, as I went out, surrounded by people whose comments I don't remember, I felt inside me - I was carrying the emotion, the sensation of having seen something so pure... Almost infantile in its purity. The faces, the gestures... There was nothing vulgar about them. The representation of eroticism, of sexuality... No, it was... I don't know why, I associated the feelings and images of The Decameron with the first stories which my father, who was a doctor, would tell to us children at the dawn of our lives, of our understanding. We would take baths naked, together with my parents, and there was absolutely nothing erotic about this representation of nakedness, other than the beauty of a moment of freedom when the body was not concealed and hidden, but represented in all its beauty. That's how I saw and experienced The Decameron. But there is this sudden change, and curiously Pasolini, whose success as a filmmaker has always been limited, is suddenly a successful filmmaker, because these films are commercially successful. And so, paradoxically, he paves the way for all the erotic genre of Italian comedies, not just for those inspired by Boccaccio, but also for the rest. BOCCACCIO'S FUNNIEST EROTIC STORIES The film was a box office hit, and we paid attention to successful films. As my friend Punti used to say: "You have to always..." "tag along with..." "Success isn't eternal, so you must tag along with successful films, and repeat the recipe, even on a smaller scale." I think that Pasolini, being extremely in love with himself and vain, was very pleased with his success at first, and that he hoped to have found a popular national art form, not in the sense of a Gramscian first phase, but which opened up the possibility of communicating immediately, without the superstructure of elitist cinema, an intellectual but also cultural superstructure - with the audience, understood as a mass audience which must be changed into an elite. But it didn't take him long to understand that this... the commercial attraction that this genre could have would actually be a catastrophe, the opposite of what he wanted. This audience was the same omniphagous audience that now goes to Christmas films. This audience wants to be diverted, it always has, and it's extremely dominant. I immediately thought that Pasolini had opened a window into thick-headed Italian censorship. Thick-headed because it allowed violence, it allowed all these situations which have degenerated into what we see today, but ran after any suggestion of sex. A healthy thing. A natural thing. But perhaps it wasn't natural for these people, with their questionable minds. Therefore, I didn't have the idea of copying Pasolini. I had the idea of following him. These are two completely different things. Following a situation which a person, given his... his undoubted cultural weight - even if his morality was doubtful - had opened up. In Italian cinema, nakedness had remained as it was in La Cena delle Beffe. And immediately, no-one spoke of "pornography". People spoke of an "opening". And with Decameron no. 2, I tried to create an opening. That's it. Following the style, not copying it. Boccaccio's Other Stories I was a small producer, as I still am - but I was free. I went ahead as I could. But you must understand that the secret was being quick. You couldn't let the audience's interest die down now that Pasolini's film had awakened it. We started without a real script - it worked, since the film was made up of episodes. It was all fragments, so... There was just this common thread that held all the stories together. As early as during production, there were situations that you might call hostile, with... With visits - let's put it like that... Health and safety inspectors, etc. It got to the point that, as we were filming in Mondragone, because one of the actresses was called "Bambina" ("Little Girl"), someone denounced us, claiming that we had children on the set since a "little girl" was filming. The police turned up to find this sixty-year-old actress, and quite rightly went off again. When the film came out, La PEA, which had produced Pasolini's Decameron, sued the company for plagiarism. We went to court, and we won the case, because there was no plagiarism. After all, Boccaccio had written the stories, and we had written "the other stories" on the poster, as well as the number 2, which pointed out it was a follow-up, in order to avoid any confusion with the first film by Pasolini. I only met Pasolini once, in the PEA offices, when the plagiarism trial was still underway. And he wasn't very courteous to me. He said that I'd copied him, that my film was just smut. But how could he know that when no-one had seen it yet? Even I hadn't seen it yet! Anyway, my film was smut, and I wasn't capable of dealing with such literary material - in short, he wasn't very polite. That was the first and last time I met Mr Pasolini. He also said something - that was... that this behavior on the part of small producers, including myself, was immoral. Coming from him, it seems to me a little strange. When the film came out, it was banned, because there was a certain Public Prosecutor in Italy - I won't say his name, but... Whoever was working in cinema in those days will remember him - he would ban everything. He had this strange notion of morality: if anything appeared on a screen that had to do with sex, it had to be burned. And many works of art were burned in Rome. It was banned. I went to Rimini, where they usually passed anything. We knew that the magistrates there passed everything. But, strangely, I was talking with the... Public Prosecutor there... He said: "The press always criticize us here." "They say we pass everything." "That we're too liberal. So we're going to take one film to court." And I said: "So you're going to take my film to court?" There were other Decamerons around. And I should go down? What about the others? They were overtaking me. There were foreign films that had been bought, and had the title Decamerone slapped onto them... He said: "But those ones haven't been reported." Within ten minutes I'd reported another three. I reported all the Decamerons that were to be seen. Now the Prosecutor had four films to take to court, and he passed all four of them. And that's where it all started from: this circus of real and fake Decamerons. Gabriele Crisanti made me this offer: - I've got this film for you. - You still owe me for two other films! "This one will cover them, because I've already sold it to such and such a distributor." And... He gave me a screenplay. I can't remember if I had the courage to read it through to the end or not! I returned to the stories in Boccaccio, and reinterpreted them when I shot this film. He only gave me two constraints: the title - Decameron 4, I think it was - two weeks of filming, "because that's how much money we have", the end credits. "Then if in between you put 2,500 metres of blank celluloid, I don't give a damn." That's what he said to me! Many producers started to do this, they delved into Medieval literature. But then what they shot had nothing to do with it. The films they shot were written by screenwriters who may not even have read these stories in the first place. Many independents, as you call them, many producers and authors adapted themselves, tagged along and made all these little... We had been living from making Westerns, and before that from making mythological films. Then from Westerns, and then from various other things - and then there was the era of the small Decamerons. Which all derived from the great - the great film by Pasolini. Pasolini had the merit, if you can call it that, of giving birth to a very important sub genre of Italian erotic cinema, the so-called Decamerotic genre. The commercial importance of the Decamerotic genre is obviously characterized by the audience's desire to see eroticism on the screen. That's the basic motivation. These films were produced along these lines, clearly stripped of the values - so to say - of the cultural value that Pasolini's work undoubtedly had, that it contained within itself. And they focused, of course, being entirely commercial products, on this sexuality that was playful, merry, on the jokes, the gags, the adventures, drawn from stories, some of which certainly were by Boccaccio, but also mixed in with stories by Aretino, by Massuccio Salernitano, with Geoffrey Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, and with Arabian stories from the Thousand and One Nights. All of this mixed together. Why mixed together? Because actually, there were at least ten films with the title Decameron or Decamerone. Then only a couple with the title Canterbury or at any rate inspired by Canterbury. And then various others about the Thousand and One Nights. And the Thousand and One Nights is quite curious in terms of the situation that was created. Because, in fact, Pasolini's film, Arabian Nights, only came out in 74, having been shot during the previous year. But already during that previous year, in 73, films came out which anticipated it, including in their titles: At Last the Thousand and One Nights, for example. Still on the Thousand and One Nights, there's a very odd title by Aristide Massaccesi, which is actually better known under its second title, Diary of a Roman Virgin. But its original title was The Thousand and One Nights from Boccaccio to Canterbury. As though its story was bringing together The Thousand and One Nights and Canterbury and Boccaccio, or Pasolini's Decameron. More wonderful than The Thousand and One Nights More erotic than the Decameron More comic than Canterbury I can tell you that only two or three, maybe four should be saved. The rest were just trashy films, of an extremely low level, which were very cheap to make. Because producing a film made up of episodes only costs half of what a feature film costs. These types of films were left to come out, shortly after their premiere, in small local cinemas. Only a certain type of audience went to see them, as the ticket was cheaper as well. Alas she loves me, and sleeps with me after every other man, to be faithful to me. If only she would betray me! How was the Black Decameron born? Did it start in the wake of Pasolini's success? No, no. Was it your project or Vivarelli's? No, I think Vivarelli wanted to make The Black Decameron. I hadn't thought of making the Decameron in Africa. What a man! What a man! What a big man! Ours was the second, after the Decameron Decameron. The book was a book that had been published in 1904, called Die Schwarze Decameron, the Black Decameron. It was by a German ethnologist, Leo Frobenius, or Leo Frobinius, however you say it, who had written it during long trips and long stays in Senegal and such places - above all in Senegal, because in the North of the country there were Islamic people, and Animists in the center and South. And so he found, and he was right, a great correlation between the eroticism of Boccaccio and the eroticism of certain stories, both Islamic and Animistic. Obviously, there are various facets to the Decamerotic sub genre. There are films which you might call more politically committed. Like Roman Tales of an Ex-Novice by Pino Tosini. Or Prohibited Tales with No Clothes On by Brunello Rondi. Or the Boccaccio by Bruno Corbucci, for example. Or two films by Festa Campanile: Jus Primae Noctis and La Calandria. As well as these, there are the cruder films, the more... the more funny ones, more crudely... Pure comedies, made for the pure pleasure of entertainment, of showing grotesque situations, semi-naked women, and suchlike, with maybe the support of comic actors. In this period, for example, one of the films, which later became emblematic of a whole sub genre, That Great Piece of Ubalda, All Naked and Warm. Ubalda saw things differently: she was always naked, and was warm every day. Then of course a fashion developed and there were some scenes in the Decameron style. But in reality it was another story, another type of story. And the film was successful, despite being one of the last films of this genre. And then it was like a big - how can I put it? A big curiosity. I read some reviews after a few years - when it came out, there was the usual massacre. At the end of the day, it was quite right about commercial cinema. At that time I just wanted to make successful films, and I did. However... Every time a new sub genre appeared in the 60s or 70s, in Italian cinemas, there would almost always appear another sub genre that contrasted with it. So, roughly speaking - of course, some sub genres existed in parallel - but for example, Westerns were later supplanted by Italian police thrillers. In a similar way, the Decamerotic genre later died because Malizia was born, and with it the whole series of sex comedies. Master, do you think that if a foreigner met us he wouldn't know who you were? Seeing you arranged like this! Pasolini... I'd seen Pasolini's film. I had loved it, as everybody had. And I'd also followed, a little, his... His sort of Sorcerer's Apprentice quality. He had created a pure work which was then transformed into merchandise, which was popularized by a market that exploited an "eroticism" to which Pasolini had absolutely not intended to give the value which was then given to it by the market. He didn't open up a window. He opened up a road - a motorway. Only one or two people go through a window. Everyone went through this. He changed the idea of pornography. Pasolini is extremely snobbish about commercial cinema. He probably doesn't even consider it as cinema. But I think he hated the Boccaccian sub genre to such an extent that he didn't even evaluate its worth. Pasolini doesn't analyze it. For him, it's an obvious case of degeneration that is already present in a society that commercializes everything. It's the same as the fake brands sold in Naples. Something that sells is born, then similar things are produced because you have to exploit this terrain. But what seems interesting to me is how much this success, for Pasolini - who defined success as a form of social persecution - how much this success hurt him. Because beyond the vanity which might have been satisfied by it, by having a wider audience, and thus also giving him the illusion, or at least the hope, that a certain type of work on transgression, on bodies as a vehicle for sensual innocence, and so on, could be received by a new audience. But this new audience in reality was becoming omniphagous towards sensuality. Of course the seventies are the decade in which erotic cinema exploded on all levels, not just in Italy, but in Italy it became a systematic phenomenon. But this really hurts Pasolini. Pasolini is literally disgusted by the idea that he could be instrumentalized, and robbed of his discourse on innocence, and returned instead to what he wanted to break, i.e. the idea of sinfulness. Why are these films so successful? Because they legitimize - let's put it like that - instead of Catholic dogma, faith, the couple, reciprocity, loyalty etc. - the omniphagous, satyric attitude of the male and the infinite promiscuity of the woman - other dogmas which Pasolini, above all in Arabian Nights, but also in the Decameron, was challenging. When he disowned the Trilogy of Life so brutally in 74, saying: "I was defeated, misunderstood." "I realize that these bodies -" he starts talking like in Lutheran Letters about "empty-eyed youths" - "are completely submitted to an order which is an order that accepts this type of discourse on sinfulness etc." It accepts these dogmas and breaks them, not because it wants to transgress and negate these dogmas, but because it finds in the act of sinning a further stimulus. This is such a huge misunderstanding. And the commercialization of sexuality is the ultimate and definitive form of prostitution, which Pasolini won't tolerate in any way. And it leads to an equally clear reversal. Because the idea is to come to Salo, which is... The Trilogy of Life with a minus sign. SALO or the 120 Days of Sodom All the vitality in the Trilogy of Life is answered by the mortiferousness, so to say, of Salo, and the Sadian obsession with the mortification of the body. In Salo, he makes literal what he believes has happened to the bodies and minds of young people. Or rather: the attempt to extract, and to organize - to literally make people eat shit - maybe the shit-eating in Salo is the best metaphor for Pasolini's thoughts on the success of the Boccaccian sub genre. Ultimately, if you're brought up to eat shit, get around the table and eat it - and learn to eat it, to survive with it. His disowning the Trilogy of Life is a gesture of rage directed at himself. It's the admission that he nourished an illegitimate illusion, that he had allowed himself, at a point in his life, a pause for joy and for thoughtlessness - this is how Pasolini expresses it - which was illegitimate. Why create a work of art when it is so beautiful to dream it? Pederasts have a lot of sensitivity, but they don't last long, they're like maidens. Girls are nice at 10, 18, 20 - if at 40 or 50 they put on a miniskirt it's ridiculous. So you see. It's nature's revenge: it makes them more sensitive, more intelligent, more skillful - up to a certain point, while they are still ephebes, and even afterwards, up to their thirties. Then there's decadence, then they become horrendous. You see it, even on ephebes, beautiful people, who then become... So he was lucky, in that - well, lucky isn't the word but: nature made it so that, in the moment when he was clearly decaying - Salo is clearly decadent - he died. There's a beautiful letter from 1940 where he explains to his cousin that he experiences homosexuality as something that lives alongside him, that terrorizes him - and not as something internal. So as something that he is a slave, a subject to. Maybe it's this vision of sexuality, seen as an addiction, a form of dependence, is a kind of substratum for his theory on the reification of bodies. If you take this dependency on sexuality and interpolate it with the social evil that sells it, and makes a commercial object out of it - the molotov cocktail you get then is really unbearable. And I think Pasolini is experiencing this implosion when he disowns the Trilogy of Life. Repentance without a sin. He did something he felt like doing. He did it well. With taste. If you know how to look, there is also something more behind the images. If you know how to look. But how many? How many people saw, in Pasolini's Decameron, what he wanted to show them? Very few, I think. And only because he told them what was behind the images. The rest saw naked women, intercourse, and things we'd never seen before on the cinema screen. We'd seen it on other screens, but not there. So I think he repented without having sinned.
