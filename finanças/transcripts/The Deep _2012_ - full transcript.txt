Westman Islands, Iceland Active volcanic islands in the North Atlantic Come along, old chap. -Alright. It must be something I ate. You're never too careful with food! Hi. -Hi. Gulli! Come join us. -In a minute. Are you from the North Island? -What? From the mainland up north. -Yes. But I am sort of from here. -Sort of? Why are you back on the islands? -I got a job on Breki. So you're the new cook. Are you any good? Not really! Buy me a drink, Gulli. Back the fuck off, you fucking asshole! This is my girlfriend! Get out and stay out! Cut it out, guys. -Let him be! Let go of him! What the hell were you thinking, man? Somebody had to save the new cook. You're a freaking maniac! Food is just important to me, man. Do you think we'll go out in this weather? If we can get out of the harbour then we will. It's not that bad. -The storm is going down. You're a piece of work, Dad. Completely wasted, but totally clear on the weather. I'll turn this down so the old man can sleep. No! He'd sleep through an earthquake. What are you playing? Mozart! How many records do you have? I've stopped counting. Well, I... I don't really have the time to listen to them all. Well, I'd better get... -Shhh. Listen. THE DEEP Inspired by true events. The six o'clock weather forecast. -You weren't so chirpy last night! Feed the poor thing well. We'll be out for a few days. The weather seems to have gone down. -Yes. I just hope he's not changing direction and then picking up again, the bloody bastard. TO DAD FROM BATMAN BJARNI AND SPIDERMAN GILLI Don't mess it up. I folded everything. Did you pack my blue sweater? -Yes, it's in there. I can't find it. -It's in there. I packed it. Alright. Let's get going before the boys wake up. Don't forget your sack, dear. -I won't, Mum. Your father is taking me to work. Do you want a lift? No, I'll just walk. Alright then, take care and may God be with you. Yes. Is it enough? Damn, it's cold. -Yes. So, did you sleep well? -Yes. And where did you sleep? -Cut it out! In my bed. -Oh? Are you alright? -I've seen worse, man! Could you bring in the rest? And? -What do you mean? Well? -Stop it. Hey, wasn't she at the dance last night? Yes. -And? Nothing. Is he completely wasted? -No, he's just too hung over to talk shit. Dad! -Huh? Go start the engine, before we freeze to death. Damn. Bloody hell. I remember this guy Raggi. -Yes. Sissa's brother, right? She used to be your... They moved to the mainland after the eruption. He got into some trouble. Do you think he'll last longer than the last cook? Why did he quit? He had been seasick for two years. -No way! Two years? SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS Can't you swim? -Sure. Or maybe not, I'm not really sure. Don't they teach you to swim up on the mainland? Morning, mate. I had almost forgotten the beauty of this place. How long has it been since you left? I haven't really been here since the eruption. Just as a visitor. But I clearly remember the night of the evacuation. The red stream of lava and the burning heat. Is there coffee? Raggi! Have the guys show you how to make the coffee if you want this to work out. Right. Bloody hell. -We've snagged the damn thing. Should I ease the wire? -Just a little. Let's see if it comes loose. It worked. -Alright. What bullshit. There's nothing to be had here. I told you. Nothing worth catching. Hey, guys! Jon said to ask you how to make the coffee. He wants it black as ink. Throw in half a pack. Half a pack? Seriously? He must have burnt some fuses in his head. Is there more bread? I can make some more. Hey, boy! Just hand it over. It's quicker that way. Do we have something to watch? -I don't know. Do we? -I don't know. It was your turn to go to the video store. There's nothing left to watch on BETA. It's high time we switched to VHS. BETA's got better quality. What the hell does that matter if there's nothing to watch? Did you finish watching Jaws? -I was here eating when it ended. -And? Well, they... -Don't give away the ending! Calling Westman Islands radio. This is Breki. Westman Islands radio. What's your location? I'm approaching the Leddin. That's confirmed. You'll report again in twelve hours. -Sure. Over and out. Now we're talking. What's for dinner? We're having pork. -Pork chops, I reckon? More like chop sticks. Sweet and sour. Just make it chops, mate. With breadcrumbs. Damn, she's rolling. It's the undertow from yesterday's storm. All clear? -All clear. You can hit the sack, guys. It's going to be a few hours jack. I heard a good joke last night. -Yeah? Boys! Off to bed. It's way past you bedtime. But Mom, it's the weekend. The weekend is over. You have school tomorrow. Mom! The bedtime story. Where was daddy up to? I know what you've got under there. - Now, please behave, my darlings. Here's the right page. "The following night he went to the village church." "He carried a big bag on his back, a parcel under his arm and held a torch in his hand." Temperature: 28,4°F (-2°C) The sea: 41°F (5°C) Weren't you going to wake me up? Relax, man. We're just throwing in the trawl. Gulli! Where can i find an anorak? An anorak? -Yes. -Check up on deck. Damn! Shall I cut the line? -The fishing nets are brand new. I'll try to detangle them somehow. What are you thinking, guys? We need to turn the winch off before we tip over. It's stuck! Turn the winch off! The winch off! Raggi! Hurry up on deck. We're going down! Guys! Raggi! Raggi! The winch! Gulli! Gulli! -Is everyone out? Where's Dad? -Gulli! Hannes, come on! -Dad! -Hannes! Away from the boat! -Dad! Hannes! Hannes! Jon! -Hannes, stop it! Dad! -Hannes! Hannes. Talk to me. -Jon! Hannes! -What's happening? Where did he go? He went back for his dad. -Hannes! Mom, I can't sleep. Come along, darling. Let's say our prayer. Be above me and all around with your eternal blessing. Angels of God, I pray will watch my bed while I am resting. God bless my Mom and Dad and all the people I love. Amen. ...lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, the power and the glory. For ever and ever. Amen. Palli! - I'm so cold. I can't... Jón! Put these on. Jón. Did you manage to send out a Mayday? No, but it's almost time for us to report in. They must start looking for us soon. Palli! Come on, Palli! I'm going to try to free the life boat. Don't be ridiculous. It's rusted solid. We have to do something. We can't just die here. Take my hand. So cold... Grab the boot. -We have to... ... to start... swimming. Swim? No way. I'm so cold. How far from the coast do you think we are? A few miles. I think Leddin is about three sea miles off land. I can't... -We have to swim. Swim? Where to? -Come on, Palli. It's hopeless. I can't... -Palli, we have to try! Maybe someone will find us. There must be other boats out here. I can't. -We have to swim. It's each man for himself. Otherwise we won't stand a chance. Alright? -I can't... Palli, we can do this. Palli, come on! We can do it together. I won't leave you. Come on. Palli! Palli... We can do it. Look! There's a ship. -Hello! Help! Man overboard! Help! Help! Over here! Help! Over here! Man overboard! Help! Palli! They must be heading back with the catch. At least we know now in which direction to swim. Right, Palli? If you make it... -What? If you survive... Palli! Palli. Palli. Jón! Where are you? Jón! Jón! Jón! Jón! Jón, where are you? Jón! Temperature: 27°F (-3°C) The sea: 41°F (-5°C) Seagull! Go tell them to come and get me. If you do... If you do... ...I promise never to kill another bird. Birdie! Do you want to hear a joke? There are three men on a plane... ...it's about to crash. We have a Brit, a Dutch guy and an Icelander. There are only three... I mean, there are only two parachutes and... I'm sorry, bird. I can't remember how it goes. Birdie! Where are you? Don't.... Don't leave... Don't leave me... Catch me, Palli! Set him free. Gulli! This is an announcement for the people in the Westman Islands. Homeland security asks everyone to gather at the harbour and prepare for transport to the mainland. What's happening, Dad? Can you describe the current situation? We contacted the police and we're advised to stay calm. But we just heard the announcement on the radio, so we will leave. We have four children... -Yes. We're going down to the harbour. We don't have a choice. We'll just ask God to watch over us. How is the weather on the islands? -Really good. So the weather is good. -Yes. But now there is pounding on the roof. -I see. That just started while we were talking. I see. Is it windy? It's been completely calm as far as I can tell. Very unusual and completely against the weather forecast. Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them that trespass against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil. For thine is the kingdom, the power and the glory... Help! Help! Help! Over here! Man overboard! Help! Help! Help me! Help!! Over here! Help! Help! Fucking hell! What are you guys thinking?! Turn around and bring back the boat! Do you have a girlfriend, bird? A sweetheart? You can tell me. I can keep a secret. I promise. I don't want to die. Not just yet. If only... If only he would give me one more day. One day. Just one day. That's all I ask. I would wake up early. Just one more day. What a day it would be. I'd drink my milk from a glass to please Mom. I was never the perfect son, but somehow she managed to make a man out of me. Then I'd go to the bank and make the last payment on my bike. I would only drive it this one day. It won't matter. I just don't want anybody to be left with my debts. I'd comfort Halla and tell her that Palli didn't suffer. That he just fell asleep. And I know, because I held him when he passed away. Then I'd get the old dog and have Mom take care of it. After that... I'd go visit someone special... And then you can have me. Then you can take me, you hear? When I've said what I need to say, done what I have to do. I'm on the right track! Right? My island! Temperature: 28°F (-2°C) The sea: 37°F (3°C) I swam... Dad! There's a drunk at the door! What the hell are you doing here at this hour? I swam... Breki went down at the Leddin. We've called the Coast Guard. Are you sure the boat went down at the Leddin? Gulli! Were you definitely at the Leddin? I can't feel the pulse. His heartbeat is regular. Did you take his temperature? -Yes. -And what is it? I don't know. The thermometer doesn't go below 93°F (34°C). Is he below 93°F (34°C)? Hello. Have they been found? They won't be found. Not after an accident like this, son. Dead sailors... ...are best kept in a watery grave. There's no way he could have swum all this way. He must have things mixed up in his head. We're wasting our time here. Are you sure the boat didn't just get stranded? I'm positive. Have you found anything? -No, we haven't. We snagged by the Leddin and the winch pulled the boat down. And I swam. How long were you in the sea? I don't know. A few hours. Six, maybe. Just before the ship went down, there was a program on TV about the waltz. The waltz? On television? I actually watched that program. It came on around nine thirty last night. And you arrived at that house around seven. Six hours! In the sea. In the North Atlantic Ocean! Yes, I must have walked for more than two hours. It's just quite amazing how you did it. Isn't that the boat, sir? I'll be damned. This can't be. I can't believe that the man swam all this way. You must have thought that your time was up. How did it feel? Well... I wasn't really afraid of dying. No? -I had come to terms with that. But I dreaded the actual drowning, though. I had swallowed seawater which was really unpleasant. I had coughed my lungs out... and started to worry that I might drown. But I wasn't really afraid of dying. I spoke to the seagulls. -You did? Yes. They kept hovering over my head and... I spoke to them and asked them to check... if they could possibly... I guess I've not been to kind to them over the years. But I've somehow always been rather fond of them. They're friends of the fishermen. It's an innocent looking bird. Probably rather stupid. You know, looking at it... You think such strange thoughts. Wondering if you owe someone. Maybe they wouldn't feel right about coming after the money because you wouldn't be around. You'd be dead! All kinds of silly things like that. Amazing. Good morning, Gulli. I guess you're ready to go home now, right? No. Have they been found? Don't you worry about that. It's not in your power. Let us pray the way Jesus taught us. Our Father, which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come, thy will be done, in Earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Surviving this long in cold water i quite unique. The only known incident is from the second World War and that's based on rumours. Some people say it's a miracle. But I think that there has to be a scientific explanation. You do realize how important this is for Icelandic fishermen. And not only Icelanders, for that matter. I think that it's absolutely necessary that you join me in Reykjavik for further research. How do you research a miracle? How is the pulse? -It's fine. A bit fast though. Tell me. You must be quite the sportsman. Not really. I was not bad at chess when I was a boy. Right! I was thinking of something more on the physical side... if you're in good shape. -Do I look like I am? What about swimming? You must be a good swimmer. We had swimming at school, but I rarely went. Why was that? They kept teasing me about how fat I was, so I stopped going. Are we done? I'm not sure if I can go on much longer. Sure. I just need to measure your body fat. Hi. Do you have a passport? Don't go inside, son. Gulli! Gulli... We'll be alright, Dad. Shouldn't you boys be at school? -There's no school. All the books were lost. -In the eruption. Well, I'll be damned. One day I'm going to save up money to buy a bike like that. How many fishing tour do you think it'll take? Twenty, maybe. -What boat would you be on? I don't know. -You could have your pick. Really? -Dad says that they're short of men. A lot of guys have decided to stay on the mainland and won't be coming back. Wimps! Aren't you the famous swimmer from the Westman Islands? Sea Gulli? Couldn't you tell us a bit about your exciting experience! Well, I'm just on my... -Ladies and gentlemen! Here we have a national here. A man who conquered the Atlantic Ocean! There are mainly two things that interest the biophysicist. Firstly, the fact that he managed to preserve a thermal balance for five to six hours while in the cold water. This is seven times longer than any overweight person has previously endured during experiments. Secondly, the fact that according to tests performed at the Westman Islands hospital, his thermal balance at core temperature was below 95°F (35°C) which goes against all previous research... I can give you something to help you sleep if you like. No, thanks. You're the talk of everyone here at the hospital. Really? -Yes, you've become famous. Like a national hero. -I am? Why? What do you mean why? You must know that. You achieved something extraordinary. All I did was to save my own life. Wouldn't everyone have tried that? They don't really know what to do with you. To them, you're something of an enigma. I see. Well, you must be anxious to go back home. Yes. I just wanted to thank you for everything. It was a pleasure to get to know you. Are you leaving? -Yes, I think we're done. But we haven't come to a conclusion yet. I have. I'm going home. Hi, Joe. -Hi. So you're back. -Yes. Were you in England? -Yes. Did anything come out of all this? -No, I don't think so. Is the dog inside? -Yes, I've been feeding her. Hello, old girl. Easy now. Calm down. He didn't suffer. He just fell asleep. He simply fell asleep. You sure have a lot of nice cars. -This one is Bjarni's. Right, Bjarni? What about this one? -It's mine. Who gave it to you? Dad gave it to me. He gave us all those cars. Does it hurt? No, little man. It's alright. -Are you a seal? Or maybe a troll? Or a sea monster? -A monster? Everybody says that it's impossible to swim so far and not die. No, little man. I'm not a monster. Not a troll either. I'm just a man. A very lucky man. Dad, he also swam. -Yes. Just not all the way like you did. Right. He was too cold. It was so cold. Mom says he's with God now. Yes, and he's watching over you. Thanks. Come along. Hi, Gulli. Good to have you back. Good evening. -Evening. -The anoraks are in the cabin, right? This film is dedicated to the Icelandic fisherman. I spoke to the seagulls. -You did? They were hovering and probably just a bit curious. The whole night? Yes, they were hovering over my head the whole time. So I spoke to them. I asked them to get some help. You did? -If the possibly could. What was the hardest moment? I think it was when we sat on the keel. Right in the beginning? -Yes. And also when I realized that I was all alone. Experiments suggest that a naked, average man has no means to save himself due to lowered body temperature after being in sea or cold water, for 20 - 30 minutes. Not surprisingly, fat men do not become as cold or rather cool down slower than thinner men. Of course, I'm nothing but a small drop in the ocean. And nobody is really bothered with this thing happening...
