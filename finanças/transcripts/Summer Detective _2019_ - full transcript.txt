Good bye I'm sure that he earned no more than 150,000 Why is that? I calculated for him He sold 3 grown cattles and 4 baby cattles. A grown cattles was worth 15,000, right? 8 would be 120,000 A baby cattles, 7,000 4 means 23,000 So he would earn no more than 150,000 I don't agree I told you, you need a higher price His baby cattles are less than two years old Age doesn't matter Anyways, you've got to offer more Chaoying, how much did you make on your twelve cattles? 170,000 My god Good for you.

I will leave you alone OK Zhanyi Zhanyi Zhanyi I'm not waiting anymore The market is closing soon I will go first Okay You are so slow Uncle What happened? When I passed by Tangfeng village west I saw a person lying in the reservoir The scooter looked like Uncle Shuhe's Then I went down there, it was really him So I brought him here How is he? He's... not doing good He injured awfully Uncle I told the doctor That he fell down on his own You must not spill the beans Why? If we admit he was hit by a car Insurance won't cover the medical bills How can you lie about it? The police will find it out We can't call the police If we can't find the driver So much expenses have made We'll have to pay them ourselves But we can't let the driver run away Just listen to Shuangzi A hit-and-run driver is hard to track in the rural Let's first make sure the insurance claim goes through We could get at least 70% reimbursed Just listen to him. He is right How is Shuhe now? Not good Let me pay the money first Let me pay. I have money I'll pay for it as he was helping me rebuild my house He's my brother, I'll pay Mum, calm down You will spend your money sooner or later since we have a patient in hospital Let's go No, I must pay Just listen to me. Go I think we should call the police Without the police's help How do we find the driver? Your uncle was hurt so badly If we can't find the driver What do we say to Shuhe? If the police can't find the driver Who pays the medical bills? You? If so, I would pay You have to think about it You only pay 30% of the medical bills if we leave it like this If we call the police and they can't find the driver You'll have to pay the entire bills Anyway, I have no money Hello Is that Honghong? Which Honghong are you? Are you Honghong from the mill house? No. I'm looking for Shuhe's Honghong Bye Can't reach her Uncle where is Honghong now? Who knows? Someone saw her in Wuhan Said that she had a baby Shuhe went to look for her once Didn't find her What can you do if you marry far away He just had to stop her Too bad for him He raised a daughter in vain Slow down Good heavens Be careful Shuangzi The police has been waiting for you Tell them what happened Where was the scooter located? It was right there. It never moved It was still there What about the person? He was lying there face down Which direction was his head? His head was in that direction You get over there You go over there and show them the way it was All right That's the way it was OK One and a half meters What's your name, officer? My surname is Zhao Officer Zhao, Do you think you can find the car? How should I put it First, there's no CCTV Second, there's no witness Main problem is the rain was so heavy The scene has been destroyed It's difficult to solve the case But we will do our best You, get up, get up Get up Hello, doctor Doctor, I am Shuhe's friend How is he now? The operation went well But his condition is not stable We sent him to ICU We need more time to examine Doctor Where is your Mum? That's my business. Mind yours What are you gonna do about the bills? How much is it? The operation itself costs 30,000 Plus 8,000 a day for the ICU You do the math Chaoying, Before it's too late Withdraw the case and put it through insurance We already filed the case, can we still withdraw? Is 1000 too little? Too little? How much is enough? It is enough REWARD: 1,000 for Witness in Car Accident West of Tangfeng Village There's a bridge here Is that a bridge? You drew a bridge It doesn't look like a bridge It is a big hole Leave it like this It's pretty close There's no village to the east of Tangfeng Then there's the reservoir If we search other villages The car may be from Matun This way leads to the city We have to take it into consideration Which direction did the car head to? To the west? To the south, or to the north? Or it came back? It must be a car from one of the three villages It hit Shuhe on the way to the market I just remembered There is lot of traffic on the way to the city This car might be taking a detour Sure, then where the hell can we start the search? I told you it's difficult The police said it too We gotta find it regardless Shuhe is in the hospital can't make Chaoying pay all the fees. I mean we start from the neighborhood first Then we can extend to other areas It'd be even harder if he fled through the freeway He'd be nowhere to find Incense is from your heart Smoke is from your belief If you are honest God will listen to you I've heard your story What do you want to ask? We want to know which car hit Shuhe? Nothing will leave these walls One of you two must go out You go out now Can we trust her? Don't be silly.
