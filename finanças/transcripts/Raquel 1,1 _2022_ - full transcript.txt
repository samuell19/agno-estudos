I'll take the suitcases to the bedroom. I thought you could stay in the room that was mine and I'll stay in your grandfather's. All right? THE SEVENTH SEAL -Thank you so much. -You're welcome. Excuse me, you are from the church, right? Are you new around here? I just arrived. -What's your name? -Raquel. And you? -I'm Ana Helena. -And I'm Laura. -Nice to meet you. -Nice to meet you. Do you know if there is any other activity besides the ones on the wall? Yes. We do many activities to spread God's word. We have a service, that is actual led by my mom. We have a group cell at my house. Have you been touched by God? Yes, a little… I am new to this. So it's worth it. I think so too. Then you meet everybody. Ok. I'll get your number, ok? I felt something interesting about you. ANA HELENA ADDED YOU TO THE GROUP "YOUTH MINISTRY” ANA HELENA: GIRLS, THIS IS RAQUEL. ANICE: WELCOME! LAURA: RAQUEL, WE WANT TO TAKE YOU SOMEWHERE TOMORROW. CAN YOU COME? ANA HELENA: BRING YOUR SWIMSUIT! Wow. Help! Darling, are you all right? You are too hot. Are you feeling well? Do you want me to prepare something for you, maybe a tea? No. -Can I turn off the light? -Don't, leave it on. Rest now. Good night. God is thirsty for healing. And we go, like: opening our path, opening our path. Because our path is illuminated. Our path is the word of God. -We have a direction. Am I right? -Amen! In Matthew 26:41, "Watch and pray. So that you will not fall into temptation." Do you know what that means, brothers? That even though we're being watchful, Evil will want to prevail. The power of Satan. The force of darkness. The power of the serpent. But we have the power of light. Which is much stronger than any other force. And we will use that. We will use this against Evil. That's right, my daughter! That's right! -And I want an amen! -Amen! -And I want Glory! -Glory! Don't cut it into rings. Cut into small squares. -It's better. -Ok. We have to take advantage of this situation to the fullest, my daughter. We can't suffer any loss from this. At all. I invited some friends. You did? How nice! Which friends? Some people from the church. Oh, from the church... Dad, people from the church also do groceries, right? I know. That's right. It's all right. But… Don't talk too much to these people, okay? Why? They are cool. Okay, they're cool. But college friends can also be nice. By the way, how's this matter going? I don't know yet, dad, but I'm looking into it. It's good to think about this. Think about your future. Cut this one too? Very tiny, okay? -Did it light up? -Yes. -Hello, Elisa! -How are you doing, Dulcidio? Let me do it. Go down a bit. Wait, look! I think it's cute. Do it on Raquel. Come here. We love using it as makeup, you know? Did you see how well they are getting along? -Yes, that's true. -Yes. Hermes, you can count on us for anything you need. Because this period of transition is not easy. Thank you, Elisa. I think about Raquel... After everything that happened to Vera. We are made of love I think he is cute. I think he is cute, and hot... What is this, Laura? God is watching. As for Raquel... She is watching nothing, see? -What? -Gustavo. His family owns Monte's Newspaper. Yes, Monte's Newspaper. -That only prints bad news. -Liar. There's nothing to it. It only runs here and another couple of cities. Oh yeah? God is watching. Vera! -André, now I can't talk. -Wait. Let me talk. I'm trying to talk to you and you don't answer me. I don't answer because I don't want to talk to you. But I'm your boyfriend! You're not my boyfriend, André. We broke up! Open that door! Genesis. Corinthians. Proverbs. Hosea. Deuteronomy. Judges. Raquel. Savior The special name for our Lord Savior ow ow ow The special name for your Love Savior The special name for our Lord Savior The special name for your Love Now I know why God sent me and why he sent you too to this place, to this suffering. This is all part of God's plan. We are not lost men, Assos. Our lives are not insignificant. We have a mission to accomplish, which cannot be done anywhere else. Oh, my brothers! How glad I am to live with you. Because that's God's plan. I'll write it all down. Hey, we're going to have a party at the Church. Want to come? Raquel? -Raquel? -What? -Oh, sorry. -Okay, I'll clean it. WHO WROTE THE WORD OF GOD? To the woman, he said, I will greatly multiply your grief and your conception, and with grief you will bear children; and your desire shall be for your husband, and he shall rule over you. And the head of Christ is God... But the woman is the glory of man. Now, as the Church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything. Ephesians 5:24. ...I'm not doing well these days, you know? But it's okay. I think she was right. I mean, she must be right. I guess... -Hi. -What happened? You know that model contest that I said I was going to do? -I passed. -Wow, how cool. But then the pastor said that I better not go. Yeah, Pietra. Because this is not for you. -That is not a serious profession. -But what's the problem? -You will stray from the path. -But why? Laura has some news. -If you don't tell, I will! -What? -Come on Laura, tell us! -Don't need to gossip about it! -What is it? -Tell us! We got engaged. -Really? -Yes. Damn, congratulations! -Thanks. -Thank you. The pastor gave the blessing and everything. Now the challenge is to wait for the wedding. Congratulations. That's so cool. Thank you. Tamar. How many people have you brought to the church? I always try to bring people in, Anice. How come you never succeed? -That's offensive. -Jesus brought twelve, remember? But I am not Jesus! But we, as a church, must seek that, to be like Jesus. Yeah, right. Laura, you go... Oh, God... What's your biggest fear? My biggest fear? -C'mon, Laura! -Calm down, I'm thinking! Of a car running over me. -Is that your biggest fear? -It is, why? Okay, I just hope this isn't a lie. Because the universe conspires! Oh, really? I thought it was something more interesting. The end of times, Lucifer, spiders, something like that. -Well, it's my fear.. -Uhhh... Why did you come to Monte Megido? Because my father was born here. No, what she meant was... What happened for you to come here? She already answered, her father was born here. Okay, why did you come back? -We wanted to start over. -Start over what? You never wanted to start anything over? It's your turn to answer, Raquel. I already answered, we came to start over. Yeah, she already answered. Now she asks the question. Fine. Ana Helena. Do you believe in everything that is written in the Bible? Everything written in the Bible is divine. Go, Suzana. Your turn, Tamar. But do you think we should be submissive? We who? Women. For you to understand what the Bible says about the woman being submissive, you first have to understand what true submission is. And submission is a rule for every Christian. But it was a book written many years ago and was written only by men. There were many writers, but the authorship is from God. Yes. Ok, but... What's in the Bible is much more than just written words. God speaks in parables. Behind each word is a message. And that message is only deciphered if you've contact with the Holy Spirit. Do you believe that women brought death and sin to Earth because it's written like that? Raquel, you already asked a lot of questions. It's against the rules. What rules? Who wrote the rules? Me. -Ana Helena! -Wow! I think the Bible should be revised. Revised? Yes, if it has been rewritten so many times, why would it be any different now? I advise you to pray. LAURA: ARE YOU OKAY? RAQUEL: YES... LAURA: I AGREE WITH YOU. AND IT'S NOT JUST ME... RAQUEL: WHAT IF WE START A NEW GROUP? LAURA: WHAT ABOUT THE CELL? RAQUEL: IT WILL BE DIFFERENT. LAURA: BUT DID YOU DECIDE THAT NOW? RACHEL: I THINK THAT... RAQUEL: I'VE BEEN RECEIVING SIGNS. Hi, Elisa. Hi, Raquel. How are you? May I help you? Coffee. Do you have it? -There. -Oh. Thank you. All set. -Need bags? -No, thank you. So... I was worried. There you go. -Thank you! -No problem. Hi. And the grocery store is doing well, right? Yeah. It's good to think about that too. -Come back soon. -Good afternoon. Do you wanna talk? Talk about what? I don't know. There's something bothering you? Raquel, I'm worried. Why? You know, darling... Unfortunately, I no longer have the bookstore. And not only I don't have the bookstore, many debts appeared in its place. So our life depends on this. It depends on this city, these people. We have a home here. We have a store that can rebalance us financially. That's what we have, Raquel. I have no other option. You need to help me. I will help you, dad. That's good! That's good! And... There is also something you need to know. We're in a small country town. Here, when you tell someone you've heard or seen something, that person will tell another, that will tell another... And suddenly, everyone is talking about you. And depending on the way as the story goes, you lose control of what they say. You don't want people to be talking about us out there, do you? So you have to be careful with what you say, my daughter. Vera, if you think that I'll just leave here, you can forget about that, ok? André, please, go away! There is no one here! Did you cheat on me with that bastard? Are you completely crazy? Dad, pick up! Please, pick up! André is here. He's completely out of control. He jumped the front gate! I'll burn this house down! He said he's going to set the house on fire. If you're with someone else, just tell me... I'm not seeing anyone! Enough! -I want to see him face to face. -There's no one here! -There is... -Stop! First we start identifying the verses, right? CIRCLE OF RENOVATION Which we will comment on. Then we cut them and organize according to the Books. We take blank sheets, we glue these sections, and we comment below with our observations. -Cool. -Ok? Deuteronomy 22:20. "If, however, the charge is true and no proof of the young woman's virginity can be found, she shall be brought to the door of her father's house... ...and there the men of her town shall stone her to death." Judges 19:24. "Look, here is my virgin daughter, and his concubine. I will bring them out to you now, and you can use them and do to them whatever you wish." Corinthians 14:34. "Women should remain silent in the churches. They are not allowed to speak." Deuteronomy 22:5. "The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman's garment for all who do so are abomination unto the Lord thy God." If a man marries a woman... Leviticus 15:19. "When a woman has her regular flow of blood, and her impurity is upon her flesh, her monthly period will last seven days, and anyone who touches her will be unclean till evening." Timothy 2:12. "I do not permit a woman to teach or to assume authority over a man. She must be quiet." Genesis 2:18. "Then the Lord God made a woman from the rib he had taken out of the man, and he brought her to the man. She shall be called 'woman,' for she was taken out of man." Ephesians 5:22. Peter 3:1. Proverbs 30:20. Exodus 22:18. Ecclesiastes 25:26. "All malice is small compared to a woman's malice; let the lot of sinners fall on her!" BRAZIL IS RANKED NUMBER 5 IN VIOLENT DEATHS OF WOMEN THE DAUGHTERS OF MARY MAGDALENE WHO WAS MARY MAGDALENE? WHY WAS JUNIA LEFT OUT? NEW MESSAGE FROM ANA HELENA ANA HELENA: RAQUEL, ARE YOU COMING TO THE SERVICE TODAY? IT WILL BE IMPORTANT TO YOU. In Apocalypse 22:18-19, "For I say to every man to whose ears have come the words of this prophet's book. If any man makes an addition to them, God will put on him the punishments which are in this book." And that's why, my friends, for that and exactly for that, that when someone comes, calling herself a prophet, it’s very important that we analyze these words according to the Bible. To see if it's true or if it's false. Because it is our guide, am I right? It is our guide. Amen! Now I want to ask you something. And I want to see who will know how to answer me. What happens to those who insist on false prophecies? -What happens? -Sinners! Apocalypse 22:18-19. God will punish these people. There's no way out of it! There is no excuse! Because, in the Bible, it says: "Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire." -I want an Amen! -Amen! Praise God! Hermes, I really need to talk to you. Sorry, Elisa, it's just that I'm a little… Is Raquel there? -No, she's not. -I will not take too long. I promise. It will be fast. Look at this, Hermes. Do you know what this is? No. That's where your daughter is taking a lot of teenagers. Taking the girls to the middle of this bush. Without any security. Have you wondered what could happen? Someone may appear there. The things they can do to them. And they're praying for God knows which devil. And who told you that? It doesn't matter who told me. It doesn't matter, the whole church already knows. And then they keep questioning me because they know that I know you. Ok, Elisa. I'll see what this is about. Pietra is dating a boy that nobody knows who it is. Tamar is missing classes almost every day. And everyone is missing church too, right, Elisa? Oh Hermes, please. Try to put yourself in these parents' shoes, at least once in your life. We don't know what they are doing there, if they are making rituals, sacrifices... Look... You have to do something. This girl is going to get in trouble. I'm warning you! Is this a threat? Hey, girls! Hi, Elisa. You came! Good! We are just passing by. Are you okay? -Yes. -Yes... To sweeten your day. Here. Let's make a toast! Want some? You have to drink it! Fine.

But I have something very important to say. One thing that can save the souls of all of you. The Evil. Evil does not appear to be bleak. Macabre. It doesn't look like a monster. Evil has beauty. Evil is manipulative. That person who lets Evil in, that person needs help. Now, if she denies help, if she denies it, there is nothing that we can do. It's very dangerous. We can't let them... Let them destroy us! Now, my question is: What do we do with all this evil? What do we do with these evil angels? Laura! Don't let her do this, Laura. Laura! Don't let her! She's doubting our faith! I never doubted anyone's faith. -Liar. -Why am I lying? I never doubted. Stop this. Go away! I believe in God too! -Out! -Out! I'm also from the Church! -Get out of here! -Get out! Go away! Guys, I never wanted to doubt anyone! I never wanted to doubt anyone's faith! I'm also from the Church! -Get out of here! -Get out! I believe in God! I believe in Jesus, guys! Please! I'm writing it for the Good! For the Good, guys! I also believe in Jesus! I'm writing it for women! Go away! She is not one of us! Timothy 2:18. Help! YOUTH MINISTRY: TAMAR OF COURSE SHE SEES THINGS, GUYS! Raquel? What happened? -Raquel, my daughter? -Mom? No, no. It's me, your father. What are you feeling, Raquel? Raquel, talk to me. No, Raquel. No, no... It is not time for that now. We will write everything again. The exams are all normal. In addition to what you already told me, Raquel, any other discomfort? What can this be? Look, she organizes her thoughts in an absolutely logical way. I have no way of giving you an accurate diagnosis with so little observation. I wanted to show you something. What is this? It's just a notebook! I know it's a notebook, and what's inside? Do you have anything to tell me about this? How come not, Raquel? I think you do. She lost her mother in a very violent way and the two were very close. At the time I thought it was good for her to find strength in faith, in a religion that is... But then she started doing some weird things... Look, it would be very important that you do therapy. Doctor, I'm sorry. Raquel did therapy for a while. And... Anyway, wouldn't there be something parallel to therapy? Something more immediate? Because... I don't know what to do. HI :) WHO IS IT? YOU DON'T KNOW? NO. AREN'T YOU THE PROPHET? I NEVER SAID I WAS A PROPHET. I'LL GIVE YOU A HINT... WE ALREADY KNOW EACH OTHER. WHAT DO YOU WANT? TO TALK. I CAN'T TALK NOW. TELL ME, WHAT DO YOU WANT? THE POSSESSED GIRL FROM MONTE MEGIDO Heretic! Liar! Liar! Witch! -We don't want you here! -You are bringing the darkness! SHE CAME TO CURSE THE CITY. SHE HAD A VISION! LET'S PRAY FOR HER SOUL! SHE MUST BE SICK... SHE OPENED THE DOORS FOR THE EVIL! HER NAME IS RAQUEL HERNANDES REIS. Witch! -Where is he? -Where is who? -Where is he? -What are you talking about, André? -You're crazy! -Confess it already! André, please. Go away! Go away, there is no one here! No! Let me go. Let me go, André! Let me go! Go away! Get out of here! Get out! Help... Help me. Police emergency line. Officer, please! Send help! I beg you, please! My mother's ex-boyfriend is very nervous! Ok, he's nervous. And what is the occurrence? Please, officer. He's assaulting her! Give me your address. -I'll go check your room! -No, you don't, André! I can't talk anymore! I can't talk anymore! Yes? -Hi, Hermes! -Hi. Is Raquel around? No. Raquel's not here. -We know she's here. -Nope. I'm saying she's not here. I already said she isn't here. Can we wait here for her then? Unfortunately, no. Can you, please, excuse me? Ok? Have a good day. We are concerned about Raquel. I appreciate your concern, but she has already started treatment. But what happened, Hermes... I know this is none of our business. The truth is that some things, Hermes, need another type of treatment. Because they are not common things. They are things of a spiritual nature. Sorry, Elisa. I don't believe in this. We can think in a more symbolic way. It's so simple what I'm talking about, Hermes. Look, there are those who work for Good. There are those who work for Evil. Because they are being dominated by that force. I really appreciate your concern. Just one thing. Do you know the Ritual of Healing and Deliverance? Sorry, but I'm not interested. Come on, Hermes, we're already here. I think you could pay a little attention, it won't hurt. Okay, what is it about? When we realize that there is something wrong with a person, a change in behavior, a change in their eyes, in the soul, it could be that this comes from another place. Of the other side. A dark side. It's very dangerous. You don't want that for Raquel, do you? Sorry, but I don't understand what you're talking about. Raquel needs to be exorcised. It's not exactly that, that's not the word. Raquel went to the doctor because this is the treatment that I believe, and this is the treatment she's going to do for now. So I ask you to please respect our decision, and don't look for us again. We can take this evil away from Raquel! Please! Hermes, the enemy might be using her. And you are responsible. -Excuse me. -You will regret it. Get out of my house, please? What happened? I was at home. With Gustavo. We were watching a movie. And then we started to kiss and... He put his hand under my skirt. I didn't want it. I started to scream. Telling him to stop. But he continued. My brother came home. Gustavo started shouting at me. Calling me a slut. Telling my brother that he had caught me with another guy. My brother believed him. My father came home, and started to beat me. I ran away. Am I bothering you? Laura. I came here to apologize to you. I don't know what happened to me that day. Let's go home. I'll take you. I regret that. Come with me? We can talk about it. No, Laura. Stop it. Come back with me, please? Let me go. I won't go. -Laura! -She said she won't go. You're fucked. Witch. Motherfucker. Your call is being forwarded to voicemail and is subject to a charge after the signal. Take care. Bye. Good morning. Go to hell! -What is this? -You are not welcome here. This is no place for profanity! Are you crazy? Go away from here! -Hell! -Get off here! You are not welcome here! Out of here! Go away! Out! Leave us alone! -Get out! -Hell! Leave! You are not welcome here! You are taking our peace away! SATANIC CULT IN THE CITY OF MONTE MEGIDO DEFIES THE BIBLE HERETIC BITCH! Raquel! Raquel, come here! You called the police emergency line. At the moment all our attendants are busy. Shit! Who did this? Who did this, Raquel? I don't know. And what is God's plan for a situation like that? What? Tell me, Raquel! To forgive. To forgive? Forgive! Forgive what, my daughter? Huh? Do you think that forgiving those who destroy our home is to do good? That's it? They don't know what they are doing. And you don't know either. You also don't know what you do. Look! Can you see the absurdity of this situation, Raquel? Can you? I don't know what else to do. I don't know what else to do. Everything was like this when we arrived. I don't know how they got in. The door was open. It was a mess. Things thrown on the floor. They left everything upside down. -Did they steal something? -There was no time to see... Dad!

Or I'll beat you up! -Do it, darling! -Ok, I'll do it! I'll do it! Calm down! For the love of God! André, what are you doing? Don't you want to pray? Then pray! Stop. -André, I'm sorry. -You don't trust me. You are right, I'm sorry. I'm so stupid! I'm so stupid! I don't know why I left you, André. I love you! -You're talking bullshit now. -I mean it.

Take your hands off! -Let's try it again, please! -Take your hands off! -Please, you're going too fast! -Take your hands off the wheel! Watch out! -Good evening, brothers! -Good evening! How are you all tonight? -Good! Thank God! -Thank God! But I hope you leave here better than when you arrived. Because today is the night of healing and deliverance! It is my favorite night because tonight God works His miracles. -Praise the Lord! -Hallelujah! What is the cure you are looking for today, brother? What cure do you need? What do you need to experience before the Lord, brother? Look. Do not waste your illness. Do not waste, as the disease is an opportunity for revelation, brothers! Amen! It is through disease, be it physical, emotional, spiritual... It is through sickness that God works in us! -Praise the Lord! -And He will work on you! Work the healing on you! Praise the Lord! Tonight, God will do something extraordinary in your lives. If someone needs to cure the pain of guilt, because guilt hurts, brothers. Blame for wrong doings, blame for blasphemy, blame for any crime, it doesn't matter! It doesn't matter because God knows you! He knows each one of you, your life, your struggle. And it is through Him that we will heal! We will heal from everything that affects us. Today is the day that God will work a miracle. Tonight! So I want to pray for you! He is touched by your struggles, brothers. And He wants to help you. Let's all stand up. Lord! Merciful God, perform a miracle tonight. Give this young woman a righteous path to follow. Keep the tortuous paths of blasphemy away from this girl. Take the enemies away from her! The enemies! The evil angels! Take it from her, Lord! The Demon in her body! Take it away, Lord! Get it out of her, give her mercy, Lord! Heal her wounds! Bad thoughts about others! -Mom? -Raquel. Raquel, my daughter! Oh, thank you God! -Thank God!
