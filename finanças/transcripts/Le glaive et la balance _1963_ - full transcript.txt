TWO ARE GUILTY - Yes? - I'd like to see Madame Winter. She's not receiving anyone. - I have an appointment. - Sorry, I've my orders. - If I tell you I've an appointment! - If I tell you I have my orders! Ah, look. There's her secretary. She will tell you. - What is it? - I found out that Madame Winter wants to sell her villa. I have a buyer. But the villa is neither for sale, nor for rent. - I've been told Madame Winter is leaving for the country. - People say anything. - Could I see her? 5 minutes? - I'm sorry, it's quite impossible. - And useless. - Then I won't insist, but... here is my business card, if Madame Winter changes her mind. All right. But don't count on it. Come on, up! On your feet! What the... Already? Take it easy. I just dropped by. Good afternoon, good evening. What did you do last night? American idiot! I missed you. A lot. - By all means! - Yes, yes, I did! I went to hear Lou Bennett. Fantastic. You should have seen him! I was in such a mood that I came back at once, not to lose my tempo. And I painted all I've heard. And I think you'll like it too. - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. You see? I did well not to come. - I would have kept you from working. - No way! But you're on canvas! We even made love. No, no, no. It's meant to be a surprise. Don't ask me what it is, because it represents the moment. The moment I was painting. You'll see how pleased I was that I was with you. Alright. Well? - Well, it's... - Yes, it is... but what? It's... - I see, it's very bad. - You interpret my silences? I understand very well French silences. But I guess you're right. It's very, very, very bad. Good. - Johnny... - Don't, don't. Look what I'm doing with it. This is an unbreakable painting! Moron! How long will you doubt yourself? If I were you, I'd take a cold shower. - No! - For refreshing your ideas. - Come on! Come on! - Cold shower! If I wouldn't love you, I wouldn't care I am poor. Quiet, Voice of America! There are moments when I would like to kill myself. Good. Kill yourself, let's not talk about it anymore. - You like that song? - Very much. - Really? - Really. I wrote it last night. You do a lot of things at night. Nice things. And yet without me. But I got too excited... with my painting... I couldn't sleep. Then, all alone, I sat down at my piano and I called you: Agnes! Agnes! And she came back. Then, I was broke. - As if I was here? - Yes. As if. My dear... I've recorded it, and then I fell asleep listening to it. I didn't want anybody to hear it before you. "Agnes... "I'd like to tell you in French "All I think in English, "Find words that you like "Words, words... "I'm dreaming of you, mon amour, "Always and toujours "I always dream "That I love you "Love you, mon amour, jusqu'a la fin du monde. "For you I would like, my love, "Invent days, days and nights, "Nights and days, "To have you with me till the end of time. "My love, I'd like that this song "My love, this song I made for you "All the lovers, at their turn, "Should make it their love song. - My love... - I'm dreaming of my love "Love and... always, "...to dream that I love you, dream of you till the end of time. "I'm dreaming of you jusqu'a? la fin du monde." - Sweetheart, no, not now. - Why? - I haven't got time. - Then what did you come for? Oh, you... And then, after all... "I'm dreaming of you, mon amour, "Always and toujours... It's Dinah, the blues singer. She lent it to me... - Last night? - Yes, yes... We made some music in her room, with friends. You taught her my song? - I'll explain. - Don't bother, it's all clear. I like her, really. See? I'm very sincere. But I really wanted that things should pass the way I told you. - Are you mad? - No. I'm kind of tired. Of your fancies, of your lies and inconstancies. How do you expect me to trust you? In fact, a break will do us good. I'm going, on Saturday, with Madame Winter, to Switzerland. - What?! - Yes, on Saturday. And when will you be back? - In 5-6 months, maybe. - Maybe?! - And I, in the meantime? - Well, you'll meditate. And we'll see, on my return, if you became more balanced, less fly-away. This break is very important for our love. It's a good test. In 6 months, where will you be? - Will you still love me? - No, Agnes, I don't want you to leave me. All right, I quit Madame Winter. And what will we live on? - What if I find money till then? - Oh, come on! How? - There are buyers. - For your painting, or your music? One never knows. My poor Johnny, there are no miracles. No! And if you leave me, I'm capable of anything! Of anything! And then, don't smile! Don't smile! Go away, I hate you! Go away! Go! Agnes! Agnes! - It's not true. I lied to you again. - Yes. So what? What are you doing tonight? Call me. Agnes! Agnes! You don't seem in the mood. - Did you see Madame Winter? - She's invisible. I was counting on that affair. The tax collector again? Gets on my nerves! I'm tired of beggars! - But Jordan, didn't he call? - I would have told you. He's taking his time. Give it up, too bad for him. And us? If he changes his mind, we lose the option. That's life. When you risk... Who took the risks? I do, not you! Who mortgaged his car? Who pawned your jewelry to take our option? What if I can't take back your jewelry? You'll buy me new ones. With what, silly girl? No, you really must nail Jordan. A beautiful girl like you... Only a gesture would do... - What gesture? - They're not 36. It's a real pleasure to be loved by a guy like you. I'm talking to my associate, not to my love. As a matter of fact, an American doesn't count. I've tried, but I'm not his type. He only likes little girls. Better talk with your sister. - You think so? - Yes, she'd have a chance. Just look! Precisely. Talk of the devil, here's his daughter too. Bye. She's drunk. - What time d'you call this? - Now I feel like sleeping. - Where did you spend the night? - With friends. We went swimming too. - Did you take your swimsuit? - What for? - And you bathed naked? - Sure I did. - Albert said I'm well made. - Albert? Albert who? Chantal's brother. He's a connoisseur. He's an acrobat. By the way: Chantal is pregnant. At 16. 16 plus 16 makes 32. She'll be grandma at 32. - Funny! - What do you find funny? - What a face... - What? What a face you would have if I told you I'm pregnant! What?! Have you gone mad? Get dressed will you! That's it! That's it! It's all settled, Jordan is dining with us. When I told him about her, he agreed at once. Do you agree, Christine? - Shut up? - What's wrong? - I just asked Christine... - Mind your business! What's wrong with you? What...! And... bang! One all. - I don't believe that. - Here's the boss. See the proof. - What now, old Jules? - There's this Monsieur who wants to go for a trip. Oh, but I know you! Hold on, don't say anything. M?geve, ski trainer. Isn't it? - And you, a journalist. - Exactly. - Do you still teach water skiing? - No, the lessons are over. - Where do you want to go? - Do you know - Madame Winter's property? - Do you know that Madame Winter? - At Cap d'Antibes, yes. - Good. Agreed. Go there or elsewhere... But I don't think they'll let you in, you know? I don't care. Provided I can take some pictures with a telephoto. - For an article? - Yes. I haven't heard talk about this lady. She lost her husband last year. He had cancer, poor fellow! He was a billionaire. And today she's making a donation of 500 million to the Cancer Institute. Really? - Yes, she wants to keep it secret. - Then why do you say so? - Because this is my job. - What a job! Come on, boss! Hey, look! There she is! - What? - The villa. The villa! Madame Winter's. - Can you stop a second? - Just a minute. Look out! That one, on the terrace, is Madame Winter? Yes. And the other one is the nurse. Formidable! Shit! Shit. Well, it's all right? - No, it is not all right. - Who's that kid? - It's Patrick, the young Winter. - Oh, very interesting! - Ah! With a thing like that, I would never be bored. - And now, shall we get back? - OK. Formidable, this speedboat. Is it yours? Yes, and? You've done with your water skiing lessons when you can swim, right? - And why do you care? - I didn't mean to offend you. A good physique is a good job, eh? I've had enough! This is no job! Sleeping with you is not a job! I deserve more than that, fuck! - Nobody told you it was a job. - It is, if I'm living it! - Why are you wicked? - I'm not wicked, I'm telling you. On one hand I want to love you, on the other to work. Do you understand? Work? My poor Fran?ois, skiing apart, you can't do anything. What? Nothing. And you don't realize. What's the matter with you? I can't do anything, I can't do anything! I can earn money when I want, hear me? The way I want! And I can go out without my mother! Fran?ois! Fran?ois, where are you going? You're mad? Fran?ois! Miss! Miss! Miss! Oh, Agnes, what a day! I'll remember it. Take it. A little present for you. My God, how many formalities to donate 500 million! And Patrick, not too tired, did he return safely? No, Madame. The thing is he didn't return. Why didn't he? It's unacceptable! - Hello... - If it's some sort of journalist, no! Just a moment. Please answer, Madame, I beg you. Hello, yes? Yes, it's me. Why? But first, who are you? What do you say? Patrick! Yes, yes. yes. But, sir... but where is he? Where is he? My son, tell me where he is! I beg you, answer me! Oh, no! Yes... Yes, yes... I'm listening, sir. Your terms? 50 million... Yes. In used banknotes, yes. When? Why not immediately? Later... yes. Yes, I understood. Oh, no! No, I give you my word. I swear it! On my son's head! Sir... Sir, just a word, sir... They've kidnapped Patrick. They've stolen my son! My Patrick... - Madame... - What can we do? What can we do? Nothing. Just wait... that's all. Wait. No, Madame, no! I already called the police inspector. - The police? - Yes. Are you mad? They'll kill him! If we alert the police, they'll kill him! What have you done? What have you done! Madame... Madame, it's Inspector Pranzini. At last... Send him in. Sir... Thank you. - Ladies... - Miss Verlet, my secretary. Ah, it's you who phoned me. I wasn't at home, and Miss Verlet reacted a little too fast. Thanks God, it was just an escapade without consequences. Yes... I apologize, inspector. The kid should be safe and sound, that's the point. And how did he come back? Well... he was brought to where he left from. - And did he recover his pedal-boat? - Yes. - And who were those men? - Oh, some... strangers. No! No, Agnes, no! Hello? Hello, this is Mrs. Winter. I'm listening. Ah, it's you... No, I apologize. What? Ah, I forgot to sign a paper? Well, send me an employee. That's it. Agreed. Good bye, attorney. It was the notary. You're very emotional, ma'am. It's obvious this matter has shaken you. It's the nurse I'm seeing there? Yes, that's the nurse. Madame Winter, I would like to see your son. Well he's sleeping, as always, after lunch. Well, wake him up. And at the same time call this poor nurse who seems so worried. As if she didn't know that your son's returned. - Inspector... - Madame? - Please forget what I'm telling you. - Don't say anything. Your son was kidnapped? They called you to reassure you, if I may say, and demand your silence. They must call you back to give you the terms. Is that right? If you allow me, I'll alert the police. No. Above all no. No way, inspector. They'll kill him. They told me. - I beg you, don't do anything. - Do you realize what you're asking? - The police would make more sense. - If they kill my son? Well, you have my word. I won't send my men till right after his return. Thank you. Put the money into a suitcase. Tonight, at midnight, take the departmental road 67 to Grasse. At 20 km from Antibes, you'll find a crossroads with a billboard for the jazz festival. Put the bag in the ditch, at the billboard's foot, and go back home. After an hour, if you make no mistakes, your son will be home. Understood? Repeat. At midnight, I'll take the departmental road 67 to Grasse. Good. - How many cars with radio have we? - 17. Good. Where's the crossroads? Here it is. Look out! This is it. A car coming from Antibes slowing down. A white, sports car. The car makes a U turn. It stops. There are two women inside. One of them gets out, dragging something into the ditch. She comes back to the car and gets in. - Who is she? - I don't know. The car starts back for Antibes. 0:25, she's punctual. And this storm which won't start... 0:35. Ah, here they are. No. A quarter to one. What the hell are they doing? - Well? - This time, yes. A car coming from Cannes slows down. A black, sports car. It stops. - We won't see anything. - One never knows. The door's opening, a man gets out very quickly and takes something. A suitcase. The car starts off for La Roquette. - Make? Licence plate? - God knows! Hello, Prospere? Do you hear me? They're getting away to La Roquette. A black, closed, sports car. Hello! Hello, this is Prospere. It's a Thunderbird. It's heading for Mondelieu. Hello, Chambard, be careful! They're heading for Mandelieu. A black Thunderbird. To Mandelieu! The third offence since this morning. You do it on purpose, upon my word! But that one? Naturally, you don't say a thing to that one. - He goes too fast. - Like the others. This is Moreau. The Thunderbird is heading to Napoule. Hello, hello! It's followed by a biker. Hell! Why is he interfering? He'll ruin everything! If they see him, they'll think they were reported. From there they'll kill the kid... And all the precautions we took!... - We should stop him at any cost. - Stop him? But how? He passed by. Wait! A second biker. The Criminal Police. Catch up your colleague and stop him. Come on! Hurry! Scoot! - He knocked him down, bastard! - Shit! Get an ambulance! Give it up. There's no need anymore. You're sure he's dead? Yes. He takes the station platform road? Good. Keep close and be careful. Think of the kid. He abandoned the Thunderbird. Yeah. On the station platform, just below the cliff. He's going down the cliff. Yes, he's alone. There's another man appearing. They talk it over. Both of them go into the bushes. Hello! Hello! Two shots! Are you sure? On what? On whom? On whom? The two are coming back. Yes, yes. Without the kid. They're going down to the sea. What should we do? Give it all you've got. The two are at the foot of the cliff. There they are, on the customs road. They arrive at a little bay where a speedboat waits for them. A speedboat is waiting for them in a little bay. And the kid? Ah, the bastards! The kid is dead. Oh! The speedboat is getting away. It's heading to Italy. Good. Did you hear? Alert the Customs speedboats. This is speedboat no. 2. We're going to the meeting with the speedboat. Speedboat no. 1 takes the left, to cut off its way to Italy. Speedboat no. 3 goes along the coast to prevent them from docking. Good. We await contact. There it is, the speedboat! It's turning left. They're running towards cap d'Antibes. Attention, attention! Speedboat no. 1, speedboat no. 1! Come towards me! Attention, attention! Speedboat no. 3! Direction Antibes! Direction Antibes! Over. They're way ahead of us? Speed up, for God's sake! And, as soon as you see them, fire! Directly, without warning! Understood! - Shoot when you see them. - Easily said. That's all we need! Beware! They're heading to Saint-Raphael! What? Are you sure? They're heading for Cannes. It's over, they give up. Do your best to catch them alive. But take care, they are desperate! Come quickly to Cannes. Hello? The speedboat has reached the shore. That's it! They jumped ashore. What? Yes, both of them. Why! They scuttled the boat! Unless we hit them! Anyway, it's sinking! The two are running along the cliff. Going towards the port. What's the matter? They're running back to the lighthouse. Ah, this time... I see their colleagues ready to catch them. They are like rats. Wait! Take care, they're armed! - We could... - No, no! Quiet! Be careful! Come on, surrender! Come out of there! You hear me? Surrender! Come out! Hands up! Come on! - But what is it? What's the matter? - What do you say? - But, what have I done? - What you've done... Don't you know you shot a kid? Don't you know you killed a biker? - Kill a kid? Me? - Yes, you! But what is it? You're crazy? Let me go! - Get them on board! - Leave me alone! The other one? You don't arrest him? - What other one? - The fellow he debarked with. Hell! It's him who debarked with the other one! But what, is there another one? Yes. Me. It's no use to search me. I'm unarmed. How do you want me to be? I've got nothing to do with them. What nerve! - He was with him in the speedboat. - With me? You landed under my eyes! Liar! Was I with you? Was I with you? Well no, since you were with him! That's enough! Come on, take them! Go! What's all this comedy? Hello! That's it! This time, we got them! Oh, but there is another one! No, they are not two, they're three! Yes, three! Three? How come, three? But what about this? Ok. I'm coming. - Well, now there are three. - Three? They made one on the road? There's nothing to laugh at. Come on, let's go. You were 10, 12, 16! Don't even know how many you were! And none of you able to recognize them! Not even one! No! - They were two, that's all I know. - Two, two! But which ones? But finally, let's not get angry. Let's not angry. Stay there. It's these two? Good. These two? Or these two? Come on, get closer! I don't know. Do you? No. The one who invented the jazz... It's the owner of the Thunderbird. Yes, sir. We'll bring your car in front of the hotel.. No, you don't! Hello! I beg your pardon, but we still need your car. Yes, for checking. I'm very sorry but imagine I have an inquiry to make. My regrets. It's David Mortimer, the oilman. Did they take fingerprints from the car? - No. - Then? Take care immediately. And see if footprints may be taken on the beach. - With this rain... - We must try anything. - The suitcase? Where did you find it? - In the boat. - In the boat? - Underwater. - For the fingerprints we have to wait. - Really? - And this glove? - Still in the boat. Yeah. Not a good start. Did your oilman at least tell you when and where his car was stolen? Yes. After 23:00, in front of Martinez. Finally, a clue. Where are the three zebras? - Downstairs. Shall we? - Let's go. Here are, finally, the statements, and... the first photograph. Please follow me. Stand up! Come on, stand up! Take off your shoes. - You hear what you're told, don't you? - Pascal! - Name! - Fran?ois Corbier. Get the shoes to the lab with the suitcase and the glove. - Name? - Jean Philippe Pr?vost. John Parson. Loafers, loafers, loafers. We are fashionable, aren't we? Tell them to hurry up. Understood. Yesterday, at noon, while the kid was kidnapped, where were you? At home. I was sleeping. - At noon? - Yes, I spent all night at the casino. And yesterday afternoon, after 5 o'clock, where did you call from? I didn't call. Then what were you doing while you weren't calling? I was at Tam-Tam. At the jazz festival. - You too? - Me too I was at Tam-Tam. With you, probably? Yes. I mean I was too at 5 o'clock at Tam-Tam. I was, but... not with them. So, Tam-Tam is your headquarters. Well, it's rather everybody's headquarters. And you, at noon, what were you doing? I was looking for land. - Where, more precisely? - Towards Mougins. And, of course, no witness. Well, if I'd have known... And you? I... I had a rendezvous with a friend... I'd been waiting for her, but... she didn't show up. - Where was this rendezvous? - At Cap d'Antibes. Who is this friend? Your lover? Yes... in fact... my fianc?e. And why didn't she come, your fianc?e? She might have been... might have been kept at her work. What kind of work? - Secretary. - To what? To whom? - To Madame Winter. - Madame Winter? - Yes. Do you know her? - You're making a fool of me? But you? Do you know Mrs. Winter? Two days ago I heard for the first time her name. From a journalist. I had some business with her, but it was impossible to get close. I could have known her, but I was never introduced. - What did Mrs. Winter do? - You too? Careful! As if you didn't know that Mrs. Winter's son was murdered! And by whom? Patrick... they killed Patrick? The kid with the pedal boat? Gosh! By the way, boss! - The speedboat... - Well? ... belongs to an industrialist. A certain Rigo. It was stolen at Juan. - When? What was the time? - Beats me. They used it for 6 days. Go on. Shit! - You don't need me anymore? - No, you can leave. Say, through your friend, you knew all that happened to Mrs. Winter. - Yes, but we rarely spoke of her. - That we shall see. Remove their cuffs. Where could they go? - Go upstairs to my office. - No. Here will be fine. - It will be uncomfortable. - Precisely. You, come along. You first. You may sit. Are you a painter or a musician? I don't know yet. But you're American. At least that you know. By my father. French by my mother. You really believe I could kill that kid? I don't believe anything, I investigate. You'll tell me all you have done last night, from 9 o'clock. All, do you hear? All. It's very simple. At 9 o'clock, I... Come in! From the commissionaire. He thought you'd nothing to sit on. Thumbs up! He thinks of everything. Except the essential. - Where should I put it? - Where you are. - So, at 9 o'clock you were... - At Tam-Tam. Speak. And there, while I was speaking on the phone, I saw the other two. - What are their names? - Corbier and Pr?vost. Yes, they were talking, it was obvious they were friends. For two days I hadn't seen Agnes. And I was a little depressed. But now I was satisfied, because... Hello? Hello? Hello, Agnes! Agnes, you'll not go anymore with Mrs. Winter. You'll stay with me. I got two million, Agnes. In fact, I will. A buyer. Yes, yes, yes, he adores my paintings. I'll meet him at 9:30 at my place. Tomorrow, I'll... I'll be millionaire, and you too! What is it? You sound odd. Are you all right? Is it serious? But tell me what it is! You don't love me anymore? Hello! Agnes! Hello! Hello! Finally... She hung up. 9:20. I didn't want to make my buyer wait. How old are you, sir? 25. Do you know The Burial of Count Orgaz by El Greco? - The re... reproductions. - You have never been to Toledo? - No. - It's a shame. Well, in the center of that picture there is an adorable teenager with the eyes of a sad gazelle. You're just like him. Look at me. You are exactly like the young knight. We'll go to Toledo. I said idly a figure. 20 million, isn't it? What makes the value of an object is, they say, is the intensity with which we want it. At my age, desires are rare. But they promise so much pleasure! Choose yourself the canvas you would like to give me. - It's... it's very hard. - Do it for me. Come on, be for a moment your own amateur. Then, without hesitation, that one. So be it. It's the one that looks more like you? - You'll take it? - We take it. Do you know Minexene Park? Park...? Well, you'll know it. I want you to hang it, in the place you will find worthy of this beautiful gift. You want me to...? Yes, Marcel, we're coming. It's my mechanic. He's very cute, you'll see. - I'm sorry, sir, but... - What? I don't feel like being your mechanic. Come on, don't be stupid. Your young mother, perhaps? No! It's very good! We mustn't lose contact with women. - Are you coming? - No. I thought we agreed. No. Think: don't you really want to sell your painting? Picture, yes. But the painter... no. No mistake, sir, you're not reasonable. - And you let him go? - Yup. - With his 2 million? - Yup. It's regrettable. Regrettable for you. - Would you rather prefer... - No. But if you gave up this business, it's because you had another in mind. More risky, perhaps, but... more profitable. Never mind. And then, what did you do? I was... I was disgusted, then I got out. Hey, Johnny! Come with us! Johnny, come with us! They say orchestras on the Coast are very bad. Then they were organizing punishment expeditions. I don't really like this kind of crusade. Come with us! No. Not tonight. But I felt so alone... Come on, Johnny! Bravo, Mr. President. Wonderful! - It's great! - Extraordinary! What fun! We are excited! A delight! Be quiet! Municipal band, Daddy's music, kaput! Now you will hear authentic jazz, and you'll dance a real twist! Come on, Grandma, don't you want to twist? Have you heard? They compared me with Marlene. Well, if you are asked to twist, twist! Just something to be seen. It's funny, isn't it? Very funny. From time to time, one feels the need to be shaken. You don't often get whacked. You're not treated for what you are, right? But what am I? What am I? - Tell me, do me the pleasure! - I know it very well. Milou! Milou, what is this man? An old fool. I'll be damned! No, he whispered it to you. In your opinion, what should be done to be more fun? I trust you with my eyes closed. Is that so? No! No, no! Finally... Finally someone's rebelling. - Are you mad, sir? - No, but still... Boy, a carafe of water. - Water? Do you want water? - Yeah! And so, a terrible scuffle began and the police came. - What time was it? - Maybe 11. And then? Well I hid. I didn't want to spend the night at the police. But you see? You did. - Where were you hiding? - In the shower room. - And how long did you stay there? - I can't tell. An hour 15 minutes, maybe 30... I thought about Agnes. When I came out, the police had left. And they just let you go. There was a chair in the shower room. I climbed on it and... ...through the window. - And you woke up on the pier? - Yes, but like that, involuntarily. It started to rain, and I took shelter under the lighthouse, and I saw the other two arrive. Good. Let's resume, okay? At 9, you were at Tam-Tam. - If I say so! - And what were you doing? - Nothing, I was angry. - Why? - Problems. - What kind of problems? Emotional. - You too? - What, me? Nothing. You have a good face for emotional problems. - Come on, tell me that. - No, this is not for you. What? A virtuous woman who sleeps with you, right? - Exactly. And her husband is someone... - Highly placed. Here all the cuckolds are in high places. By tomorrow we'll know who the woman is. Then, if you care about your little head, better sit down at the table while the food is hot. So? - How to start? - At the beginning. I hadn't heard in a while about Simone. Yes. Last night, I left her quite brutally. I'm sorry. I had a feeling that she would do something stupid. She wasn't answering. What do I see in the hall? Well, it didn't strike me then. The two friends, the American and the other one, talking about the hit. If after that they'll still pretend not to know each other... She was still not answering. Yet I was sure she was home. It wasn't normal. So I couldn't resist. I jumped in the car, and after half an hour... I was in front of her villa. - You rang, the maid, opened the door... - No. She gave me a key, just because of the servants. I go to her room. It wasn't a beautiful sight. She was gasping in her bed. Simone! Simone! What's with you? What did you do? And, on floor, a tube of veronal. Completely empty. Did you call for a doctor? To start a scandal? No. I took her in my arms, and I got her into the bathroom. And there it wasn't easy, believe you me. Poor Simone! I really thought she was going to die. And all this, because of me... Poor girl... She'd have been better leaving me where I was. And then? Poor darling... - I beg your pardon. - Please, not you!... I don't want you to say such a thing. You still love me a bit, right? Silly! Simone, I promise you that you'll never... Never, my dear, never... - And then she fell asleep. - And you left. - Not immediately. I stood beside her. - Long? - An hour 15 minutes, maybe 30... - So it was 12 and a quarter, 12:30 - when you left her. - Pretty much. I went back to Cannes. I live there. I have a studio with a view over the harbor. I walked, that did me good. I went on the pier, because from there I can see Simone's villa. Simone... Simone who? Darbon. Her husband is at the UN. Well, you see, even the UN is good at something. I stood there, I smoked, and it started to rain... and you sheltered under the lighthouse... and you saw arriving the other two. And, of course, like the other two, you started your evening at Tam-Tam. - Well, yes. Why? - And, like the other two... Come on, I don't want to spoil your pleasure. Who did you meet at Tam-Tam? I saw Parson. Parson and Corbier. - Look! You know their names? - They told it before. What a memory! Come, buddy! There are times when you want to be a dog. - Any complaint against me? - No, but here, how we are received... It could be worse. Right. There's always worse than a cop. Watch out! A cigarette? No thanks. So, at 9 o'clock, you were...? Well, at Tam-Tam. Dinah just finished her songs, and I saw Parson and Corbier arguing in front of the cabin. Probably they were good friends, because... How long did you stay at Tam-Tam? At 10 I was still there. I had a business meeting with my associate and an American customer, William Jordan. We had dinner at Napoule. Waiting for Christine, my sister. I had invited her to brighten up the atmosphere. And, to brighten it up, she comes with two friends, Saxo and Tabou, in a state... completely plastered. - "Plastered"? - Soaked in alcohol. I was very anxious. Ah, disgusting! Two double whiskeys! Move up, you two. Brigitte, come here. Cathy, you stay there. Come on, it's over, beat it! - What?! - It's you who do business with him? You found a sucker and want to put him in a dungeon along with your sister? Shameless! (en) Hey! What is "shameless"? Gentleman. You shut up, right? Don't listen! Don't let yourself be colonized! Me, colonized? American civilization, I piss on it! Allow me! American civilization has brought you... And what it brought us... Lightning rods and striptease! You moron, La Fayette! Ah, he's crazy! He's completely crazy! Just take a walk! Beat it, both of you! - No, we stay put! - What an idea to bring them here! - But I thought... - No, please stay, Mr. Jordan. No, I leave you with your friends. - I am very sorry. - Me too. Oh, how clever! Now it's just us. Are we eating? - What? Come on, come on. - But where? You'll see. - But what I shall do? - Wait for me here. - But where are we going? - Cannes. He must have returned to his yacht. Don't you realize? I pawned all the property, all I had. If I don't pay, I'll lose everything. If you'd only told me... I thought you understood. One never knows when you're joking, or whether you're serious. Don't worry. It'll be fine. Ah, if you make your contribution too... Look. You see the boat? That one, the biggest. Look! See you tomorrow morning. Don't worry. Christine! Christine! Christine! I'm still waiting for him, he hasn't arrived yet. - What's wrong? - Come on! - Can I know what you want? - Come on! Then Christine left for Tam-Tam by car. - All alone? - All alone. - What time was it? - Who knows? 11... - And I expected my client to come back. - Alone? - Alone. - How long? - Well, an hour, an hour and a half... And you were on the pier, and it rained, and you saw coming... Come on, come on. Come On. Just in time. I have news for you - Yeah. I was at Les Monseigneurs. - Yeah? He told the truth. In the shower room, the window was open - and the seat put in front of it. - See? See? What does that prove? That you have indeed passed through the shower room. But not that you stayed there. No-no... You have concocted your stories, but each has the same faulty design: a gap of one hour and a quarter. Between 11 and 1:15 you stole the car, collected the ransom, killed the biker and killed the kid. Or just between 11 and 1:15 you do not have an alibi. Curious, isn't it? - I was on the pier. - I was on the pier. - And then I, where was I? - Forget it. Put them in the cells. Do you hear? Three cells. One for each. Go ahead! Faster, a little faster. - Well, do you know them? - By sight, yes. - More or less, with all this crowd. - Certainly I've served them. - Together or separately? - As to this... - Were they friends? - You know how it is, Today they sleep together, then no longer know each other. - Well I never! - Be quiet! Please bring me one of the prisoners, doesn't matter which one. I'm sorry again, ma'am, it's an awkward challenge for you, I know. But... Now... Hello? You can go ahead. Put the money in a suitcase tonight at midnight, take it on the departmental road 67 to Grasse. Come on, come on! At 20 km from Antibes, you will find a crossroads with a commercial for the Jazz Festival; put the suitcase in the ditch... For you. - It's just that, right? - That's it. - Good. Then sign your statement. - One moment. Haven't finished yet. - Hey, we trust you. - Why should you? I don't know you, and I don't feel like knowing you. - Yes, but be careful what you say. - To what? If I was in the mood, you wouldn't be inspector, Mr. Inspector. - Okay, enough! - After an hour, if you're correct, your son will be home. No. I don't think that was the voice. Start again. For you. - Well? - As for the shoes, - expertise was irrelevant. - And on the car, no fingerprint? Nothing. The car owner recognized his glove. - Yeah. - Good. The other should be in the water. The guy drove with it. No fingerprints, no clues. Well? No, I don't recognize him. Hello? Next. Put the money in a suitcase. Tonight at midnight... I met him at M?geve. He gave me ski lessons. That's all. I met him here once or twice, but... He never, never set foot in my house! But these? Your keys. No. No. The voice was... lower, deeper... He certainly changed it. From the beginning. Please. The other day, at noon, at the time they kidnapped the kid... At noon? I was listening to the news. I don't ask you what you were doing you, ma'am, but if, at noon, Corbier was in his room. - He claims he slept. - Maybe. I don't dish my tenants' dirt. Try to remember, ma'am, it's very important. If I'd known, I'd have looked. But, well! I was listening to the news. One hour afterwards, if you do not make mistakes, Your son will be home. No. - No. I honestly don't know. - You don't know if yes, or if no? I don't know! Next. Start. Put the money in a suitcase. Tonight at midnight, take the departmental road 67 to Grasse... - No. He had no accent. - Useless. If your friend Parson was involved in the kidnapping, he certainly wouldn't risk phoning. - He wasn't involved! - Sure, another victim of chance! Just by chance I found him at the end of the jetty! And still by chance he is your lover! Come on. We will continue the discussion elsewhere. Get your coat. - And a toothbrush. - Okay. No! No! Commissioner, no! - Agnes is not capable... - Of imprudence? Yes. Not even imprudence. - Do you know her boyfriend? - No, but I know Agnes. As you wish. I don't get it. I don't understand what is going on. Have you read the papers? "Commissioner Pranzini is delaying the judge." Well, I can't wait any longer. I gave you all rogatory letters, all search warrants that you asked for, and we are still in a stalemate! Yes, but we're in a troubled region with all kinds of problems. An uncontrolled population, sex on the beach in their hundreds, moving, disappearing, coming back, hiding... that's not life. With the means available, an inspector to 20,000 people! I know, I know... It's just, up to now, there's nothing here, nothing convincing. Negative dossiers! Forgive me, but without it I'd always forget to take my drops. Then Pranzini, what is to be done? You must get me out of this. Do you have any idea? An idea? Now they are in solitary, each in a cell. We will see. No, not with these two! Never! I've nothing in common with them! Are you coming in? Nothing in common with us?! You should still share the same toilet with us. He prostitutes like no other, he's delicate like a lady. What did you say? Repeat it, so I can hear. - Come on, repeat it! - You're also a coward? Compliments. - Coward, me? Coward? - Yup. When abusing your power, you're a coward. You bastard! I always earned my living. Madame Darbon is an exception. - "Madame"! You sound like a servant. - I respect her, that's all. And even if... even if, with Madame Darbon, This proves one thing: I had a livelihood, and no outstanding bills, as others. Nothing forced me to kill a poor kid to make my ends meet. Look: my hands aren't covered with blood. They are clean. And I hurt no one. Never! Save your tears for the jurors. It's your trouble, not mine. You've killed the kid. For a peasant, what is a child? An animal? And animals in the countryside... He had the idea, and you did the rest. - Garbage what you are! - Garbage? I'll break your mug! - Your foul mouth! - You're used to it, assassin! Come on, gentlemen, don't fight for me! Don't pretend to be enemies. It's useless. And you act horribly! What's he saying? But you know very well why they have put us together. An old trick. They're listening, maybe even see us. You know, yet you pretend to be innocent, you, accomplices. I don't cheat. I don't gamble. I haven't killed anyone. - Oh, but look at the guts he has! - What about you? In time for us. Needless to insist. However, even if they had spoken, we could have used nothing. So, no regrets. If the judge is so rushed... I'll close the dossier. Let him handle it. So much the worse for him. - Actually, it all started here. - The complications began here. When suddenly they found themselves in the presence of a third. - And, for two months... - We go round the lighthouse. I studied the dossier on the plane. I must confess that... It's not for that that I brought you from Paris. What I expect from you... But let's go, it's kind of cool here. What I expect from you is something else. We find ourselves faced with an abominable crime. A crime that comes from afar, believe me. Yes, I have a theory. Questionable, as all theories. But it is mine. One doesn't become criminal, one is born criminal. Crime is something you carry within you. - No? - Maybe. It's certain. Well, I would you like you to investigate, if I dare say, in depth. The three had a childhood, a youth, an antecedent. It's here we must search. Here are the symptoms, the germs, what shall I say? The proof of their crime: the past. It's a trail to follow. Moreover, the only one left. Fran?ois Corbier? How could I not know him? In winter, he used to come here every night. When I found out about his arrest, it was a great shock. Because about Fran?ois you can say anything. But not at all to kill a kid. - But how can you be so sure? - You couldn't even feel it. Before the story of Marianne, we were friends. Before yes, but afterwards? - Then he'd a corpse on his conscience. - What? - Take no notice, she's rambling. - Rambling, rambling... But I almost saw Fran?ois being born, so to speak. And when Marianne and he began to meet, I wasn't against it. See, I'm honest. All the summers they spent together. They walked for hours. I would like so much... so much... - What? - That summer never ends. And winter never comes. - Are you crazy? - Aren't we happy like this? Yes, of course, but... As you see, I don't ask for anything more. - Still... - What? - Nothing. - Ah, yes, of course. - Come on! Come on! - No. It's up to you. I want to get married soon. We can't marry like this. I have to put money aside. For putting it away, I must earn it. And to earn it... You would miss it, if you weren't going to M?geve to play the handsome guy. You don't trust me. You want me to make a baby soon? - So, you'll have a guarantee. - You're crazy. Since we'll get married... Sooner or later... Look at me first. Then winter came. Fran?ois was at his business. One evening with one, another night with another... He thought that was the way. - A big baby. - But a little rascal. Naturally, someone saw fit to tell Marianne. And one night... I'll never forget. He was celebrating his birthday. All were after him like starlings after grapes. And they covered him with gifts: wristwatches, a bracelet, even a radio. I was disgusted. You realize... Yes. And in the meantime, their husbands work. And, suddenly, while he was dancing with a brunette, guess who came in? Marianne. - Damn it, why are you here? - Fran?ois, I want to talk to you. Can't you see I'm busy? - Ask her what she wants. - Oh, what she wants! She just wants to annoy me. Look at her! Stood like an idiot! Don't be a punk. It was just to please you. Well, what do you want? Speak. - You promised me you'd be there today... - Yup. For your birthday. I made a small dinner... I waited, I waited... I wondered if something happened. Now you see I'm alright. Everything's fine. Even gorgeous. Fran?ois, be nice. You can't leave me like this, alone. You can't leave me alone. She's right, you shouldn't leave her alone. Who knows what nonsense she can do, poor girl! Are you crazy? What do you take me for? - Fran?ois, I'm so unhappy! - Don't worry... Come on. Come on. Let's go. Hello? Yeah. A second. Fran?ois! It's for you. Wait for me outside, please. Hello... Hello? Isabelle. Yup. In your room? A gift for me? Tell me what it is first. It's not a wristwatch, though? It's big? It's small? What is it? A gem of yours? You, then... Well, come. Nr. 7, first door on the right. - Are you still here? - I was expecting you. You shouldn't have. I'm expected elsewhere. Understand? And not by an annoying one. Come on. Go back home and wait for me. What have I done to you? Why are you so mean? Mean, me? But I made you a child, isn't it enough? Tomorrow will be another day. - Fran?ois... - Fran?ois what? - Nothing. I'll kill myself. - Good. That's it. Kill yourself and don't bother me anymore. And she didn't bother you anymore? She made away with herself. A sudden death. Hanged. All that is true, but what does it prove? I remind you that your fianc?e has hanged herself and that's all you can say? What does that prove? I loved Marianne. What do you want? I was a ski instructor. And women, of course... Should I have said no? What would they think of me? Would you say no? It's obvious. A boy who never left his village, - grew up on a farm... - Not very clever, but he got it: He didn't take long to adjust. Actually that's not the problem. Send Mrs. Darbon in. Madam, please. Your Honor... Sit down, please. Madam, I see here that at your first hearing you started by denying this providential suicide attempt which served as alibi to the accused. I was troubled, I was taken by surprise. When a beautiful woman is taken by surprise, her first reflex is to lie, it's automatic. A failed suicide... one can't think straight. A woman plucked from the waters. You went back on your statements. Indeed. When you understood that the accused might lose his head. When I realized that my lie could be fatal for him. That a woman like you could kill yourself for a guy like him, is intriguing. Right? So what? It wasn't the first. No, exactly. And I wonder if your fianc?e's suicide has not inspired somehow this alibi. Come on, have you really wanted to die for this boy? - No. - What? I wanted to die for me. Yes. While I was still beautiful. - You still have time. - You are sweet. He was so happy to believe that I killed myself for him. Isn't that right? - Not a bad man, but... - Yes, not too clever. He's healthy. Besides, the clever ones, you know... My husband is very intelligent. But he lives far away, and deals with so many things... I met him, and that's it. He had no needs. He didn't ask me anything. That taste of luxury he is charged with, I gave it to him. I taught him to love beautiful things. To be lazy, to live... at my expense. It's true. I wasn't short of clothes. And a speedboat? Why a speedboat? I can swim! And why should he kill? To procure money? - He only had to ask me! - No! He killed foolishly. Out of pride. Out of pride? Him? In order to prove to himself that he could do without you. He wanted to get rid of you, and escape an existence he couldn't bear anymore. Your Honor, you really think it's so awful to wake at 11am, to have no other care than to bathe, to choose ties, and making love to me is so embarrassing, so monstrous, so demoralizing? That a man can run a fate so cruel preferring the risk of killing a child? We lived in the same fraternity house, Johnny and I. He was a nice guy. Very intelligent. But too easy influenced. - There we are. - Thank you. The fellow in the middle there is McLaughlin. Johnny was absolutely fascinated by him. Mac belonged to a kind of a secret order, the Mandrakes. Johnny asked for membership. And was willing to undergo all the hardships of initiation. Mandrakes! Mandrakes! Mandrakes! Ha! Mandrakes! Mandrakes! Mandrakes! Ha! Johnny Parson, as much as you seek the great honor of admission to the Mandrakes, show us that you are worthy. Swear on our Bible, swear on Zarathoustra you'll always remain loyal to the code of Superman to the Mandrakes. - I swear. - That you'll strangle the snake of formality? - Well? - I swear. That you'll reject all form of small-minded idealism? - I swear. - So be it. The name of the girl you're with now? Nancy Holler. And what feeling of sentimentality does she inspire to you? - ...What do you mean? - Just what I said, Johnny. Well... Certain tenderness... and respect. You got all week to bring her to the fraternity house. We gotta play poker next Saturday night, and draw the high cards for her. Four highest win, in that order. I don't understand. Don't let me down, Johnny! You promised, remember? Alright. Alright. Mandrakes! Mandrakes! Mandrakes! Ha! "A wind bell on a windless day, "Is just a shelter for the bee." - Beautiful, isn't it? - Yes. - But I drank too much. - Just have one more for the road. Just one for the road. - Here, sleepy head. - I'm not used to it. It's too much. Oh, come on. You have to learn how to drink in order to know how to live. Just this last one and I'll take you home. Ok? Just to please me? Bottoms up! I feel terribly awful. Wake up, Nancy, wake up. - Stay with me, Johnny. - We gotta get out of here, right away. - You want me to leave, Johnny? - Yes. Hurry. Hurry! Ok. As you wish. - This way. - My head is spinning! - King. - Jack. - 10. - Jack. - Eight. - Seven. - Is she ready? - Mac, come in and close the door. Listen, this has gone far enough. We've got to get her out of here. - What's that? - Come on, help me get her out. - Come on! Please, Mac! - Relax, baby, don't get panicky! Listen! You didn't think we were serious? Hell, that's only a game, we just wanted to see if you'd guts to bring her up here. Nancy, wake up. Wake up! You're absolutely right. Get her home as quickly as possible. Get downstairs and call a cab. Hurry up, man! You'll be back in a half an hour. Saturday night the cab will take almost that long to get here. Snap out of it! What's the matter with you? Don't you trust me? All this is true, Your Honor. I was a vile man before. Those were different times. But why mention it in front of Agnes? Why? You thought she didn't know? You figure that she'll leave me, that she will blame me, perhaps? Then you're wasting your time. And I didn't wait for you. I told her everything, right away. Everything. It was much easier, much more honest. - Wasn't it, Agnes? - Yes, it's true. - I know Nancy's story. - And there's not only that story. Yup. You investigation was poorly done. And she didn't blame me, as she realized it's very important for me that she really knows me. To know exactly who I was, who I am. I never lied to her. What for? But you, have you never lied to him, didn't you ever hide anything from him? I don't understand. Madam, you have the greatest confidence in the loyalty of the witness. Yes, the greatest. Haven't you ever had reason to reproach her? Never. Then, madam, forgive me. How did you get into Mrs. Winter's service? When my father died, who was Mr. Winter's friend and deputy, he right away took care of me. He took care of you... - How did you get along with him? - I was hired as a secretary. He knew about John Parson's existence? At that time Johnny and I were only friends. And if there was anything else between Johnny and you, Mr. Winter would have tolerated it? - I think so. - But you aren't sure. John Parson, did he know the nature of your relationship with Mr. Winter? I don't understand. Is that so? You don't understand? Shall I spell it out? Well? Well, I... I was Mr. Winter's mistress. However... And, of course, you haven't hidden that from your current lover. No, no. Agnes told me everything. And even... Now, ma'am, can you swear that Miss Verlet wasn't the one who instigated the kidnapping committed by her lover? I have no idea. I don't know anymore. - Can I say something? - Speak. Does Mrs. Winter know... and if she doesn't, I apologize for saying it,... does Ms. Winter know that her husband had for a moment... Yes, the idea of a divorce? He wrote to Agnes, in a letter. She would have had plenty of money. But she refused. And you even think after that we planned to kill a child? A child who she was very fond of, in order to get the ransom? It's stupid. Don't you think it is? I think it's a great stupidity. Is anybody in? Right away. - What do you want, sir? - Inspector Portal. - What is it? - Regarding your son. - What son? - Aren't you widow Pr?vost? - Yes. - Jean-Philippe's not your son? I have no son, no daughter. They harmed you so much? I carried my cross. To each his turn. - I pity you. - You're wasting your time. Madam... Tell me, Miss, you know Jean-Philippe Pr?vost? Yes. Why? Come on. If now I'm here with you, it's due to him. He saved my life. You'd not have thought it of him, but... Do you know Mr. Plouzenec, the Deputy's brother? I was two years his employee. Until the wedding of his daughter, Miss Amelie. Beautiful wedding... I'll sure remember it. Marie! Marie! What are you doing there? Where are you going, alone, at this hour? - Just around, I've no idea... - What do you mean "no idea"? You leave your employer at night, in the middle of the wedding? - You're sure committed! - He fired me, Mr. Plouzenec. - Why? - I cannot say. - It's serious? Did you steal anything? - No, damn it, I didn't steal! Well then? I'm pregnant. And for that...? Who's the father? Who's the father? Shoot! Tell me that! No, I don't want to. Look no further. It's Plouzenec. Isn't it? - Yes, it's him. - No! How do you know? He can't have a female employee without jumping on her. I know. - That's why. - You? He wanted to show me his villa on the shore. A house just for that, with a four poster bed. A four poster bed? I'll show you a four poster bed! - Mr. Jean-Philippe... - Come on, get in! You, drive her home. Give her a room and wait for me. - What will they say if I'm not with you? - Don't care! Move! A four poster bed! Surely we'll have fun! Alone? - I hope Christine isn't sick! - Christine... - You have five minutes? - Yes, what is it? Come over here. So what's with Christine? I don't know how to tell you, I don't want you to suspect me of a hidden thought... No, you know you can tell me everything. Especially you. Well, she didn't come along, because... because she's in love with you. - Nonsense! Christine? - Yup. Curious thing. She never gave me, but absolutely never, that impression. - On the contrary. - Oh, shyness... She feared appearing frivolous. - She places you so highly... - Obviously. Girls care about the respect of those whom they love. - Then, of course... - And she's imagining things. But tell me, in fact, what do you expect from me? I want you to speak to her, to make her understand. Only you can detach her from you. - Yes, but I don't see how. - I trust you. Well, then... I'll see her. I'll talk to her. - Can I count on you? - You have my word. Thank you. - You like it? - That's exactly how I imagined it. Well, make yourself at home. Every time you'll be gone, someone will get bored, dear lady. Alone, alone, a grown up girl like you! - Oh! Grown up? - Yes, it's true, with these heels you don't realize. Come on. Take off your shoes. - Shall I...? - Yeah. We shall see the difference. Come on. You see? We are the same size. Our mouths are at the same height. - Do you come here often? - God! When I get the chance. - Look! Mrs. Plouzenec. - Yes. It's funny, right? - What's she doing here? - Waiting to ask me to turn her around. Yes? No? Yes? I trust you. - Do you like music? - Like everyone. - The high or the low? - Fifty-fifty. But this... do you like it? Yup. Louder. Like this... It's good! So good! Well? You're not unhappy anymore? - Hardly at all. - Edouard... - What?! - Your name is Edouard. - Yes, here is a good idea. - Edouard... - Yes? How long have you known me? - Well, forever. - Yes. Of course. For too long. Edouard... If you'd known me for five minutes, what would you do? I would not refuse anything to a beautiful woman. Especially if she was a girl. I was sure! - Aren't you ashamed? - Brute! - Brute?! - Edouard! Protect me! Yes. You're completely crazy. What do you think? I think what I see. - Ah! Beautiful word of honor! Nice One! - No! I forbid you to touch him. - A man of your age, with a child! - You're judging from appearances? But this? And these? And these? - You call them appearances? - And if he loves me? It's his right! He doesn't love you! He loves no one! - You love my sister, yes or no? - Let me think before answering? - Have you thought before you took her? - Well I did nothing! Come on, tell him that I didn't "take" you! What shall I say? I didn't realize anything. - Liar! - I was so upset... Then, Mr. Plouzenec, how do you plan to fix it? - Fix it? But fix what? - Be careful! Right now, I don't mind raising a scandal! No, sir, I'm not afraid of scandal! Please don't shout! You'll wake the whole neighborhood. Let the whole neighborhood come! Nice show they'll see. Enough. Don't insist, I get it. - So, how much? - How much?! You think everything's for sale? How much?! How much have you got in your wallet? Ah, no, no comment! The victim is entitled to compensation, and then virtue, the poor relative of vice, it's normal to be helped. Finally, just between us, you didn't steal. Not a dime for himself, he gave me all the money. Do you know many would do so? This cleans up my honor, right? You wish. Unfortunately, you didn't stop there. You played the same trick several times, but... for your own benefit. There are so many bastards in the province, put a lover... - You blackmailed them. - It was justice. - Extorting money from them. - If you like. - You're consistent in your ideas. - Yes. Why? - Mrs. Winter. - No, please! Don't change track! - Come on! You can't compare... -Enough! You moved to the C?te d'Azur. What happened on the C?te d'Azur? I opened a business. I had a license. And to ensure your livelihood, you don't hesitate to prostitute your sister. - You're lying! - I forbid you to tell me I'm lying! I apologize. I'll not say it again. - And yet you lie. - You're done, alright? We're not here to make jokes. I'm not kidding, Your Honor! But no one has ever touched Christine! But William Jordan? Didn't you throw her in William Jordan's bed? Nothing happened. Didn't you take her to Tam-Tam to meet your friends? In addition she was intrigued by your absence; you were alone... pretending to expect your client, but in reality, to complete another business. Of much greater importance. It's true? Yes or no? Can you hear me? Yeah, sure, I can hear you. And frankly, I wonder who are you talking about. Who is this guy you accuse of kidnapping and killing for money? He surely exists, but it's not me. I said to myself, listening to you, "What am I doing here? Why am I here?" Being forced to think of myself, is the first time it's happened to me. The story of Saint-Malo, I thought it a joke. And Christine thought the same. But it was no joke! Just the idea that one could touch Christine gave me no peace. That's why I sponged from them, as you say. And I relieved them of money because they loved it more than anything. I never gave a damn for money. Except once, indeed, once. I was within a hair of prostituting my sister, as you say. I wanted to sell her to William Jordan. Because I was at my wit's end. Because it was the only, understand, the only way to escape! But at the last moment, I preferred to keep my sister and my honor. Then I realized that my life wouldn't make sense anymore if Christine... Finally, it was vague, but that was it... Having known that Christine, with... no! It's unbearable! No! No, it's not money I love. It's not money I covet. What I love is... If you don't believe me, I don't care one bit. To me, and not to you, I'm telling the truth. We must finish it. This joke had lasted long enough. And it's sinister. What are you so proud of, I ask you? It's two years now, and we're still at day one! - Lamentable! - Admit, Mr. Prosecutor, that... We send rogatory letters everywhere, even to America, but to what use? None! High school stories! However, we know better now... As for psychiatrist reports, always the same comedy! Grotesque! - Have you read the news? - Press!... Yes, I know. Media, public opinion, you're above it. Me too. But I'd still like to get what's due. So make an effort. I would like to close the file before the 15th. And the case should be included among the following assizes. If we go to court. What? You want to give it up? - You can't be serious? - Come on, old friend, why not? Have you lost your reason? But this will ignite the Palace! (of Justice) There's be riots with an acquittal! - The police will repress them! - No! - No, it's inconceivable! - What's inconceivable? You have full power, yes, but have you the right? I ask you. Have you the right to knowingly let two killers on the loose? An acquittal would surely be convenient! Absolution! Go, my children, sin no more! And what else? - You only think of the guilty. - But that's my job. Our job is not only to punish the people. And I ask in return. Am I entitled to keep in prison, to send to the executioner... Well, yes! A boy who's only crime is to be mistaken for another. Yes, I know, the same old song. Better acquit 20 guilty men than to condemn an innocent. But I don't like paradoxes. And how do you justify dismissal? By doubt. Doubt, doubt... Death to the killers! Do you know what dismissal would mean for those rioters? Doubt... doubt... In this business, there are two certain bodies and three possible culprits. - Two. - Two certain. And one possible. Possible, possible... well there were two when they killed the child. Two when we started to follow them! Two on board the speedboat! Two, two...! - Two. - But three on the shore! - There only by chance. Maybe meeting with the other two! But they were compelled to board the jetty. - Otherwise they'd have made for Italy. - No! They tried for Italy only because they were tracked. Otherwise, they'd go to Cannes to make the split, then each would returned to his ordinary life. Fleeing abroad meant admitting their crime. If they'd been able to cross into Italy, there'd never have appeared the third man in the case. This person is extra. He has nothing to do with all this. Well, the more I think, the more I believe the contrary. It is very clear, come on! They had to be three in order not to fail. The first kidnapped the child, gave him to the second, while the third called. I don't think they needed a third man to call. And the roles were cast to suit their possibilities. And, of course, Pr?vost, who searched the region to find land, found the cave where they hid and killed the child. Corbier piloted the speedboat, and the other one, Parson, knew from his girlfriend all the Winter family habits. It's as clear as possible. - Yes, for a prosecutor. - They were always three. The night of the crime all three were at Tam-Tam, three on the arrival on the cliff, always three, everywhere three! That's the truth! When we were both at university, if we were confronted with same problem... what would you do? - What about you? - Oh, I... I don't want to influence you. You're the only master of your decisions. PALACE OF JUSTICE FINALLY, LITTLE WINTER'S ASSASSINS FACE THE COURT THE THREE ACCUSED DECLARE THEIR INNOCENCE ATTORNEY GENERAL ASKS FOR THREE HEADS JURORS DELIBERATINTG Well, we can now proceed to vote on the first question. What do we answer: yes or no? Yes or no. There is... - May I, Mr. President? - Yes. To be honest, it's something that bothers me in your questionnaire. You don't make any distinction between the accused. You ask the same questions for each of the three. - So what? - To me, it's not fair. - Why? - Well no! Because, for me, they're not guilty to the same extent. Assuming that all would be guilty. - Assuming? - Yes. I feel they're forcing our hand, and that we embrace a little too much the theory of the indictment, and I disagree... with the indictment. But you're master of your vote! The Attorney General proposes, and the jury disposes. If you think that responsibilities are unevenly distributed, you, by your answer, can nuance your verdict. You can go from the death penalty to an acquittal. We cannot determine the role of any of the three people. We have no facts, no evidence, who's most to blame Corbier or Parson, or Parson more than Pr?vost. On what should we base our judgment? On your intimate conviction. Our intimate conviction? What does that mean? Well, it's what you think. What you think the truth is. How come? Without counting on anything? But taking into account Your intimate conviction! If so, it simplifies everything. In my intimate conviction, we must not equivocate any longer. You got me. And the innocent? Since in my intimate conviction there is an innocent. - A presumed innocent. - I see only one thing: A biker was killed, a kid was killed, I'm sticking to it. If there is an assassin in addition, so be it. This is my intimate conviction! This conversation can last all night. I have a proposal to make. To clear our judgment, those who believe in an innocent raise your hands. Mr. President? No, no... Our role is to guide, even to advise the jury in its deliberation. After that we will vote, like you, with our heart and conscience. But we don't want to, already expressing our intimate conviction, to influence the jury. Excuse me, Mr. President, I am convinced that there is an innocent. Pass. - Your turn. - Pass. - Pass. - Twice. - Can't you keep still? - If you don't like it, clear off. Do you think it will take long? What can they do all this time? It's good when it takes so long. It means they disagree. - Concerning acquittal or condemnation? - They disagree. They don't accept the prosecution case, they believe there's an innocent among us. Then I'm comfortable, because I know I'm innocent. And because I know you know it too. No doubt! In times like this, a clear conscience helps. But me? Don't I have a clear conscience? Why not? There are plenty of remorseless killers. I find Mrs. Darbon's testimony very worthy. Yes. Very moving, very... courageous. - She denied nothing. - That's the last straw! If the husband, instead of dealing with Negroes at the UN... Whoever invented that? We, fools, will pay the bill! if he dealt less with Negroes and more with his wife, we wouldn't be here today. Yup... Let us not digress. Time passes, and we have three defendants to judge. - Three criminals! - Two! Three! It's not figures that matter! - Let's come back to Corbier. - He's at least very interesting. A boy kept by a forty year old, to say the least. Mrs. Darbon, who still has much charm, without offending you, emphasized that Corbier hated her money. Yes, understood! So how come this money which so disgusted him, he asked from others so readily? - He said he expressed a willingness to work. - Work...! Exactly! He dreamt of opening a business. To open a business he had to raise money, and, for that, kidnapped a child and demanded ransom. He never needed Mrs. Winter's ransom. Mrs. Darbon would gladly sponsor him. No... If we think about it, Corbier doesn't have the makings to organize a kidnapping. He's a peasant. Peasants! They're as capable as any! To kill? Good for them! No. If I should blame someone... - Pr?vost! - You too? Have you never had business with a real estate agent? I wouldn't wish that on you! But his sister, Christine? Have you heard her? Insolent, vicious, cynical! She couldn't help but twist, while she signed statements! What has she dared say about the province? It's a nest of hypocrites and pigs! - She said "old pigs"! - Let's go back to Pr?vost. What, Pr?vost? I would trust him to God without confession. The boy is honest. Often weird, as all of his age, - but not bad au fond. - That's it, he has no funds! In order to procure them, he began life by defrauding all of Brittany! All Brittany?! And then, only those who feel guilty pay up. And the way he treats his sister, do you find it appropriate? - But what did you understand? - The same as you, what I heard! And I heard what she said! But... I won't say it again, out of respect for the ladies present. - Were you an only child? - Yup. I have the right, haven't I? Well, I have a brother. A brother whom I love very much. I understand the friendship between brother and sister. Well you know... It's a feeling that you can't understand. Why? Because I'm an idiot? Because... because you have not felt it. Curious how all women of scandalous behavior you find decent: Mrs. Darbon, Christine Pr?vost... Because I take pity on them. No one is above reproach. If you were involved in a so spectacular trial, - who knows what one might think of you. - I have nothing to hide! Me neither! And yet I have a brother, and I know what a man is. And Agnes Verlet? You would defend her too? Naturally. For you, to be Mr. Winter's mistress is a mitigating circumstance. She was 18, and him, 48. I understand Mr. Winter, but obviously, if someone abused the other, it could be only him. Mr. Winter is dead, Agnes Verlet's outside the case, it would be preferable, perhaps, to examine the Parson case. For me, a guy who loves black music... and to judge him... and to say this thing about an American, I, who abhor Russians!... I can't forgive him the poor girl's story in America. - A boy capable of that... - This will take forever? For two hours you offer your opinion about the UN, Black emancipation, abstract painting, music concrete, today's youth, ski influence on older ladies' behavior... No. Mr. President, I ask permission to withdraw. Justice in such conditions... I've had enough. But you may not go! Moreover, the door is locked. Guarded by a gendarme. - Find a replacement. - Impossible! Sit down! Please. Good. Let's resume. - What? - The dollar is falling? Morale is low in New York? What are they doing all this time? They can't find the innocent and are searching for the perpetrator. But finally, for God's sake, they could only look at us! Am I made as you? Birds of a feather flock together. Am I like you? I don't need it! I'm not a corrupt man! I never hurt anyone. I am a poor idiot. Poor idiot! Do you consider yourself too smart to kill a kid? The innocent one spoils it all! I'd give anything there should be no innocent! - Then you share my opinion? - I don't know anymore, my head hurts. But if you doubt, you have to acquit them. - All three? - All three. - Three acquittals? It's monstrous! - We'll vote and we'll see! Gentlemen! Gentlemen! Ladies! I don't want to get lynched! I'm not Joan of Arc! Please... a little common sense. It's enough if we can count. If we absolve all three, we commit two legal errors for sure. If we condemn to death all three, we'll commit only one. And we're not even sure! Me, I'm sure, on the morning of the execution I will have no regrets, upon my word. Well, at least you're taking responsibility. What responsibility? The death penalty is never final. They always ask for an appeal. Then we vote? No, sir. No vote! - You know what time it is? - I'm not in any hurry. At least can you tell us your intimate conviction? I propose something that perhaps could make us all agree, with a little kindness from everyone. A proposal which seems reasonable. A middle term. Let's do a split. Ten years. Ten years each. In ten years many things can happen. And then punishment is not irrevocable. And the innocent, if any, will have all the time to justify himself. And who will pay for their food all this time? The state? And the state is us. No! I don't feel like supporting them ten years without them doing anything! But if we condemn them to hard labor? Here we are then faced with three solutions. Want to get to the vote? - Certainly not. - Well finally we'll have to do it! - Is it useful? - Useful?! Well, it's mandatory! You were sworn in, you must fulfill your duty as jurors. You must answer the questions and give a verdict. Whatever it is. To give whatever verdict, we have no choice but between two wrongs: Either conviction of all 3, of whom one is innocent, or the acquittal of 3, with 2 guilty. We can't get out of it, and the case can't be judged. If it couldn't be judged, I wouldn't be with you now. No! No, unfortunately, this case was poorly handled. I'm not saying that no one cared, no. But they all passed the buck to others. The Police Commissioner passed the dossier to the higher echelon. The judge did the same, and we must cope. Justice runs its course! Well, no! Your conveyor belt verdicts will work without me. All these are just jokes! If you think that their guilt is not proven, - vote for acquittal. - No, not that! Doubt must benefit the accused. It's a legal principle. But you cannot shirk! You have not the right! No one wants after 4 hours of deliberations, to leave here with no verdict! - Why not? - It's not done! - All the more so! - But what do you want we do? Restart the investigation! Ask for an additional inquiry! Impossible! It's too late. As for me, This is what I do with my vote. And you, if you have the courage, do the same. Ah, no! It would be too easy, with no verdict! If you have no intimate conviction, so be it! I do and I'll vote. Kill them! Here's our verdict! Present arms! Secure arms! At ease! Send the defendants in. The court and jury, having deliberated, to the first question: Is Fran?ois Corbier guilty of complicity in the murder of the person of gendarme Alain Duclos? The answer is: no. To the second question: Is Fran?ois Corbier guilty of complicity in the kidnapping of a minor accompanied by death threat and extortion? The answer is: no. To the third question: Is Fran?ois Corbier guilty of complicity in Patrick Winter's murder? The answer is: no. To the fourth question: Is Jean Philippe Pr?vost guilty of complicity in the murder of gendarme Alain Duclos? The answer is: no. To the fifth question: Is Jean Philippe Pr?vost guilty of complicity in the kidnapping of a minor accompanied by death threat and extortion? The answer is: no. To the sixth question: Is Jean Philippe Pr?vost guilty of complicity in Patrick Winter's murder? The answer is: no. Silence! To the seventh question: Is John Parson guilty of complicity in the murder of the person of gendarme Alain Duclos? The answer is: no. Then nobody killed the policeman? Silence! To the eighth question: Is John Parson guilty of complicity in the kidnapping of a minor accompanied by death threat and extortion? The answer is: no. Silence! Or I'll clear the room. To the ninth question: Is John Parson guilty of complicity in Patrick Winter's murder? The answer is: no. It's a disgrace! String them up! Accordingly, the defendants are acquitted. How do we get out of here with all these beasts? - What are the gendarmes doing? - Ah, my cuff-links! Ah, here he is! What are you waiting for to clear the way? I even don't know if I can take your defendants back to prison to set them free. - With all this crowd. - By the back door! Impossible, the Palace is besieged from all sides. You have men, they are armed! We can't open fire on people! It's very delicate. You are responsible for maintaining order, yes or no? I'm not saying otherwise, but between us, my men are not too pleased. And they don't feel like being lynched to protect three guys who killed a colleague. Handle it the best way possible. Each to his job. - I've done my job. - Kill them! By the way, why don't you call the prosecutor? He brought us into this situation. He will tell you what to do. The Security of the Palace of Justice is up to him. He might be sleeping. Wake him up! He loves to be awakened in the night. So he'll provide protection next time. No, ladies and gentlemen, I can't let you go out like that! Why not? I voted for the death sentence! I have no reason to reproach myself! I'll explain to them! But they won't listen! For them the jurors are one! - Be reasonable, don't be childish! - I want to get out and I will! What a scandal! I've never seen anything like it! Come on, relax, it's nothing! What is it? Another catastrophe? Hello? Hello? Yes, Mr. Prosecutor. Tell me, Albert, the plumber's van is it still in the Palace yard? Yes, Mr. Prosecutor, but it's not my fault. For three days I keep telling the plumber to get rid of it, but it's futile. Listen, Albert, this is extremely important. Here's what you do. - If you had listened to me! - We listened to the voice of justice. Between two injustices, you chose the lowest. Still, it's an injustice. Come with me. Coming or not? Look! First murderers! Only afterwards honest people! We have plenty of time. What a mentality! Death to the killers! To the scaffold! Come on, get in. Get in, I say! Trust me! You had a narrow escape! Lucky I was here. Otherwise... Me with my wife and my in-law, we can never agree. Who is the innocent? You can tell me, after what I did for you. There's no risk anymore. Who is the innocent? - Shit! - Good answer! For two years I've told everyone I'm innocent. For two years no one believed me. Nobody! If I say it again, now, that there's no risk anymore, you'll believe me? Yes, if the others say the same. Naturally. Is it true he didn't take part in the crime? I prefer not to answer. What I can say... is that they put a label on my back: murderer, with a question mark. I was rejected as a villain. Declared not guilty for the benefit of the doubt. It's not even a benefit. Funny certificate! Without it you can't submit yourself elsewhere. Forgiven forever! I will never be innocent anymore. Never. So... What about you? For me only one thing matters: Agnes, my fianc?e. She never thought I was guilty. So your wife and mother, and the world may believe what they want. In an hour, I will be with Agnes, and I will be happy. Bastards! Ah! I was expecting you! - You thought we were morons! - Leave me alone! - Come on, give us the keys! - Are you crazy? Leave me alone! - There's an innocent man! - Innocent? What's that? Move back! Doubt must benefit the accused. Doubt must benefit the accused. Doubt must benefit the accused. Doubt must benefit the accused. Doubt must benefit the accused.
