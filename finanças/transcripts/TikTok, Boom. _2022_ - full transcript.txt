And I was like, "What did you just do right now?" Like, "Is this a trick? Is this a game?" Like... And he was like, "No, no, no, dude, it's called beatboxing. You make music with your mouth." And I'm like, "You are doing that with your face?" I was 15. I was a sophomore in high school, and I remember that moment just being magic to me. Like it was love at first sound. This is Spencer Polanco, and this is what I do. And I decided that night I was gonna be a beatboxer.

I didn't even, like, fix my hair for this video. And that was a six-second video. I woke up the next day and it had, like, three million views. And I was just genuinely confused.

TikTok topping Facebook to become the world's most downloaded app. TikTok is absolutely massive. Last year, they reported they have over two billion users, with almost a billion monthly active users. People spend more time on TikTok per day than Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram, YouTube. Facebook is absolutely desperate right now to regain any semblance of relevance, which they've lost quite a while ago. In many areas, we're behind our competitors. The fastest growing app is TikTok. The elephant in the room, of course, is the fact that TikTok is owned by ByteDance, a Chinese company. And it's the first time we've seen a huge Chinese consumer tech company come in and dominate the American market. ♪ ♪ So there was this guy from China named Zhang Yiming. He worked for a number of startups before starting up his own company, a company called ByteDance. ♪ ♪ The thing that struck me the most about TikTok was just how calculated their founders were from the very beginning about their goal, which was to become this kind of global force, and really, like, penetrate the, you know, the zeitgeist of the US. ♪ ♪ The story is going to sound very similar to many Silicon Valley entrepreneurs. Zhang Yiming came from a middle class family. And he basically just had this dream that he was going to make something important of himself. ♪ ♪ So, when the iPhone came out, in the late 2000s, he was just really blown away by the fact that you could have a full computing device, small enough to fit in your pocket, and he was just convinced mobile internet was going to be the next once in a lifetime opportunity that you'd read about in history books, and he was determined to take advantage of this big wave. ♪ ♪ They started in an apartment, which is very common in Chinese... sort of internet entrepreneurship lore. About 2015 or so, ByteDance was doing experiments with video, and Yiming had this sort of strange idea about recommendation engines which serves you content that it thinks you'd be interested in. So ByteDance bought Duoyin. ♪ ♪ Within six months after launch it hit this inflection point. Somehow it just became viral. Yo, what's going on? Dude, it is so hot. Dude, why don't you just go get some Ben & Jerry's ice cream? People pay me to put their product in my videos. It's--it's--it's crazy. These are from this week. They're so many. Look. I get, like, clothes from, like, all different major brands. Look at that. After the success of Douyin in China, a lip-synch app already popular with kids and young teens in the US. And merged them, rebranding the app as TikTok. One thing Zhang Yiming did was to create two different products. Duoyin was for the Chinese market, and it was a Chinese app, and TikTok was for the global market. And what that meant was that he could keep the Chinese app walled off in China, with Chinese rules, and then keep TikTok for the rest of the globe. TikTok was, all of the sudden, this huge success from day one. TikTok has done what no other Chinese-made app has done before. It's cracked the international market, and become a global sensation. TikTok is now available in 154 countries and 75 languages, rivalling Silicon Valley's biggest apps. TikTok and its owner ByteDance were the first Chinese social media company to really provide a wake-up call to Facebook, Google, Amazon, and others, that it's not just about Silicone Valley bringing technology to the world, but, really, that China's a real force to be reckoned with. There's sort of this perception that there was too much of a cultural difference between China and the rest of the world and that Chinese companies didn't know to build globally successful social media. I think TikTok's completely blown that out of water. The world we all grew up in was one where America dominated culturally, where it dominated technologically, and the world that we would end up retiring in would probably be one where China dominates in most of those areas. Power's shifting to China rapidly. And ByteDance and the story of TikTok is part of that. - Hi. - Hi. - How are you? - Good. So what are you gonna do? I wanna play with... adding just, like, more dimension to my hair, it's, like, a little flat... Yes. I think that it's scary to be the first generation, to have our entire lives documented. ♪ ♪ Every action, you know, every haircut, every look change... it's on people's radars. You know, I work a job where so much of it is, like, looking... being looked at, or... - Yeah. - Looking at myself, honestly. Big deal. So, I'm influencer and content creation work, so I went viral for the first time, uh, when I was 16 years old for a confrontation with my Senator. Republican Senator Jeff Flake held a town hall in Mesa, Arizona last night, and got an earful from 16-year-old activist Deja Foxx. Take a look. So I'm a young woman, and you're a middle-aged man. - I'm a person of colour... - Ouch. ...and you're white. Uhm, I come from a background of poverty and I didn't always have parents to guide me through life. You come from privilege. Why would you deny me the American Dream?

And I suddenly realised that all those things I've been putting on social that I thought were only going to the people who knew me, overnight I could be visible to people that I will never know. ♪ ♪ The internet connected me to the entire world. TikTok is a blowup overnight kind of place. On any platform where you can get extreme reach, you open yourself up to benefits, right? larger followings, more views, more attention. You must open yourself up to more hate, to people who are going to tear you down, tear you apart, pick at you... I live in a pretty constant state of anxiety. I don't know what it's like to live in a world where I'm not being perceived always. And it's this tug of war between... that's kind of what I want, and it's kind of the thing I fear the most. I think there is a really interesting line between what it means to be empowered by your sexuality, versus being exploited by it online. I definitely think that women are seeing larger followings, more attention, from the ways that they're being sexualised online. You can be a bad bitch in a bikini and a boss bitch in a blazer. Do both. The posts where I'm showing more skin do better. But I also question why that is. If we think that these platforms really are just showing us the most popular content, without really interrogating why we're seeing what we're seeing. That's dangerous. There is so much mystery to the algorithm. The algorithm. Like, what does that even mean? When I call your name I shall place the sorting hat on your head... and you'll be sorted in your Houses. I refer to TikTok as a sorting hat, in reference to the sorting hat from "Harry Potter." When the kids show up at Hogwarts, there's this magical sorting hat that sorts them into one of the four schools. TikTok's recommendation algorithm serves as that type of sorting hat. It sorts its users into different audiences, then it sorts videos into different clusters that appeal to different audiences. Most apps, like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram you actually have to follow a lot of accounts, or other people, or people you know. TikTok is very different, in that, even if you didn't follow anybody, you would over time, just by using the app, get a very personalised entertainment experience for yourself. Is anyone else, like, a little weirded out about how specific TikTok's algorithm gets for the "For You" page. The "For You" page on TikTok is the default that the app opens into. On the one hand, it has a bunch of attributes about the video. It has the song in it. It has a dog. And the other, it has a bunch of attributes about you, you're this age, you live here, those are contextual clues to feed their algorithm to determine what your tastes are. My TikTok algorithm is just like, "You have ADHD, you have BPD, you're depressed." When you're looking at each video on the "For You" page, TikTok, the app, is looking at how we react to that video. The algorithm starts to become smarter and just off of these long sessions where you're addictively scrolling through videos. And then adjust what videos it shows you in the future. And over time, it builds almost a fingerprint of your tastes. I'm talking, like, I was just thinking about making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, and then, out of nowhere, someone is making a peanut butter and jelly on my "For You" page. But lately, I kid you not, it hasn't been things that I Google or I talk about, it's been thoughts. Are any other girls, like, kind of aggravated that it took more than 20 years to figure out we were bisexual, but it took my TikTok algorithm like 37 seconds? TikTok is just the latest manifestation of the power that comes from connecting billions of people in the world with really powerful machine learning recommendation algorithms. The creator economy is the fastest growing type of small business, with more than 50 million people around the world who consider themselves to be Content Creators. ♪ ♪ All the biggest brands, they wanna do TikTok campaigns, because it has the hype right now. TikTok has just really resonated with this Gen-Z audience, which is where the most valuable users are. We have brands poised to spend over $15 billion in the next year, on influencer marketing alone. Eyeballs bring money and brands chase the eyeballs. chase young users. In less than a year, you have almost 35 million followers on TikTok. Over two billion likes... Billion. Wow. TikTokers, they've embraced that idea of being the entrepreneur. They're not just in it to get famous, they're also in it to get rich and successful. The social media influencer market is a multi-billion dollar industry, and some young people are cashing in big time. I mean, these TikTokers are making more in their first year than a lot of huge YouTubers have made throughout the entire past decade. Late 2019 was my first brand deal and it was for Nike. When I first told my parents that I was doing something for Nike, they were like, "What? Nike? Like Nike?" The fact that anyone wants to use beatboxing for anything is the coolest thing on Earth to me. This is a doll made for Little Caesar's. Life-size. Even got the hair. I'm a beatboxer, and I'm hanging out at Jason Derulo's house, like, "How did this happen?" Like this is dope. TikTok has made music more fun. When we talk about revolutionising, you know, an industry... ...that has existed for so long by itself... TikTok's taking away that guardian, that little gate. Now there's so many independent artists, especially coming from TikTok, that have just, like, cult following that'll have people that believe in them, being outside of the industry. It wasn't until I was on TV, when I presented at the "Billboard Music Awards," that's when my parents, they were like, "All right, Spencer's on TV now, I don't know what to do with this information." ♪ ♪ TikTok has also completely upended the talent industry in Hollywood. Hollywood people love TikTok, because they're like, "Great, more famous people, more people to make us money." These TikTokers are launching their own brands. You have a beauty line coming out, right? Think of Addison Rae, right? She's a hugely popular TikToker. She launched Item Beauty. So you see a lot of these young TikTokers building already multi-million dollar empires. Someone like Bella Poarch went viral for this, like, lipsynching video, where she's making these funny facial expressions. ♪ It's M to the B, it's M to the B ♪ ♪ ♪ She used that to launch a pop star career.

Even if it was for a comedy or makeup. Whatever I was posting, people wanted to watch it. And I was, like, "Okay, so anything's possible on this app." ♪ ♪ Anyone can basically go viral on this app. ♪ ♪ After joining TikTok, I decided, like, "Maybe I wanna make more political-savvy videos, and I got more--more views on that. Hi, if you, um, actually think all lives matter, I want you to speak up about the kids in cages at the border, I want you to speak up about the kids dying in the Middle East. I want you to speak out about the child... I first read about the Uyghurs through social media since I do follow Muslim pages, and try to keep up with my community. Across the Northwestern province of Xinjiang, an estimated one million Chinese Muslims have vanished into a vast network of detention centres that targets Uyghur Muslims. I saw someone post a picture of these Uyghurs, Uyghur prisoners, and when I did more research, I found out that this genocide is happening in front of us, and no one is speaking about it. ♪ Okay, okay... ♪ It says, "News outlets when innocent Muslims "are getting murdered every day in the Middle East and in China." The next day, after I posted that video, I--I looked at my feed, and I saw where the post used to be, it was no longer the image of my face on there. It was just a black little box. When I clicked on it, it just would say, "Video unavailable." I was shocked at that time, but once I found out that TikTok is a Beijing-owned app, I was no longer shocked. I found out how TikTok's basically using our data, using our information, and using it for their own benefit. TikTok is a Beijing-owned app. It has censored videos that are against the CCP. I don't know about you, guys, but I wanna know what TikTok's doing with our information. AI is--is hungry for data, so the more data you have, the more accurate the AI becomes, so in the age of AI, uh, data's the new oil, and China is the new Saudi Arabia. Your data is an asset to a lot of companies. Google and Amazon and Facebook are so big, and they have so much money because they have all of your data. And there's a whole secondary market for data, called "Data Brokers." And they're gathering all of this data, and they're selling it to each other, and it's really no different than the stock market. If a company can start gathering that data, thousands of points of data a day, from the time someone's five until the time they're 18, those companies, when they sell that data, they have a profile that knows a child way better than a parent would. And that is extremely valuable to advertisers, and to people who want to persuade you to do something you might otherwise not want to do. If social media is determining and tracking you in different ways, and--and telling you what your dreams are going to be, based on the ads you're getting, that impacts the kid's brain and it impacts their goals. There's a lot of harms happening with these companies that are--are based in Northern California. What's different about TikTok is, where is this data going? TikTok is reportedly under federal investigation. The US Government reportedly launching a national security review of the company's data collection, and censorship practices, amid concerns that users personal data could be accessible to foreign governments. there's very little transparency, just because a tech company says something... and I'm not just talking about TikTok. We don't have to take the tech company at its word. And I think Facebook is somewhat scared of the quick rise of TikTok, because all that data that Facebook was getting is now going to TikTok. The Chinese, one of the few markets where Facebook is unavailable right now, because of government censors... While Facebook CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, appears to be trying bit by bit to reenter the world's largest internet population, China. Facebook was probably the most aggressive social media company to try to get into China, because social media in China had been blocked for a number of years. ♪ ♪ Mark Zuckerberg is trying to find a way that they could exist somehow in China. And so he learned Mandarin. He went to a number of conferences, where he could put himself in front of Xi Jinping, and speak to Xi Jinping directly. And he really was aggressive in saying, you know, "This is a huge market. "How can we be this global connector for the world and not have China be part of it?" But it became clear to him in the last few years that it's not going to work. And so he completely changed, he completely had a 180 and he went, uh, on the offensive. A decade ago, almost all of the major internet platforms were American. Today, six of the top ten are Chinese. He realised that, "If I can't win over "the Chinese market, then I'm gonna make it harder for them to win over my market in the US." Mark Zuckerberg has reportedly called TikTok "A threat to democracy." What the Facebook CEO failed to mention is that he tried to purchase TikTok's predecesor, Zuckerberg's clearly very concerned about TikTok, because it's the most genuine new competition he's received for a long time. I remember when Facebook was the number one place on Earth. My grandmother doesn't even use Facebook. She's too cool. No, I'm kidding. I posted a prank on my page, and it has like three million views right now. - Oh! - You know what? Uh-huh. Come here. Yeah, yeah. Mm... I think it's all about how creative you are. I mean, that's what TikTok has taught me. Eh! - That was good. - I like that one. Content's easy with you, Merrick. My name is Merrick Hanna. I am 16 years old. When people think of influencers... I think they think it's very leisurely. It's not. - It's fast. - Is that how it goes? - Yeah, it's that fast. - Why is it so fast? - 'Cause it loops. - Ah. Yeah, so it seems like it's longer when you watch it. I don't think it needs to be quite as fast as you're suggesting. Try to make it longer, you're rushing so much. To manage Merrick's career at this point, is definitely a full time job, on top of my full time job. Reading all the emails for him, reading the contracts, reading offers, replying, the back and forth... My dad helps a lot with finding ideas, because that is a big part of it. He'll find a trend that he thinks I can do, he'll show it to me, and I'll be like, "All right, I know how to do it." Hit, hit, hit. Now push back. Even though it may not seem like it, he does a lot of the work. I--I don't sleep quite as much as I used to. It's like a gold rush. Brands wisely are now seeing that you can pinpoint an audience better, probably, through social media, and TikTok especially, than a lot of traditional means of advertising, and then, there's a lot of people who's trying to take advantage of the gold rush, who just shouldn't be, who are incompetent, but a lot of the influencers are young and inexperienced, - and don't know better. - Right.

"I pay all of my own bills, and then, additionally, I pay my mom's bills." And monetising on social media's given me the opportunity to do that." When I'm being abused or harassed online, it's almost impossible for me to step away. And it's kind of like an abusive relationship in that regard. I have to open myself up to this hate, because this is what creates financial stability for me.

So that algorithm that's always trying to figure out what the hottest trends are, is constantly lifting something up to the stratosphere, and then taking it back down again. To me, this is bigger than TikTok. It's about who in our society gets heard, and what you have to do in our society to get heard. ♪ ♪ After my first video about the Uyghurs was taken down, I knew I had to disguise my video, so I grabbed my pink eyelash curler, and I started curling my lashes. This is the one that started it all. Hi, guys, I'm gonna teach you, guys, how to get long lashes, so the first thing you need to do is grab your lash curler, curl your lashes, obviously, then you're gonna put them down and use your phone that you're using right now to search up what's happening in China, how they're getting concentration camps, throwing innocent Muslims in there, separating their families from each other, kidnapping them, murdering them, raping them, forcing them... I spoke about that in just, like, 40 seconds, and I continued on doing the eyelash tutorial. ...this is another Holocaust, yet no one is talking about it. Please, be aware. Please, spread awareness. And... yeah, so you can grab your lash curler again... It reached millions, it reached millions, and... people were... People were shocked in the comments. You popped up in my "For You" page and I was like, "Oh, my God, that's Feroza. I was, like, "I sent this to her," and I was like, "Why are you on my 'For You' page? And why do you have, like, so many likes?" It was like crazy. I had to tell my mom right after that. I was like, "Ugh, people are sending it now. I should tell my mom I have TikTok." My mom, like, we were watching the news, and she's like, "Is that Feroza?" I was like, "Oh, my Gosh. Yes, it's my friend". ♪ ♪ A 40-second video going viral in just one day. That's, like, the power that TikTok holds. So I decided to post two more videos, uh, the following two days, to just post more information on how to help. Hey, guys, you wanted a second part to the video on how to get longer lashes, so here it is. And, by the way, I say that so TikTok doesn't take down my videos. I don't think TikTok noticed what I posted at first, and then the following day, it was like a Monday, I wake up at 5:00 a.m. for school, and I go on TikTok to see how many views the next two videos got, and I see that I can't even go on TikTok. My--my account's suspended. "Your account is temporarily suspended because it goes against community guidelines." Nothing from my posts violates community guidelines. I show nothing of hate speech, I show no profanity, everything I spoke about was factual evidence. My first thought after seeing this black screen on my phone was, "I'm not letting them silence me." I--I quickly made a Twitter account. I quickly posted on Instagram that, "Hey, I was silenced for speaking up", and I'm not gonna let them get away with that. And I asked people to continue sharing the video. I'm so grateful that people heard me saying that my voice was taken away. 17-year-old Feroza Aziz... Joining us now is Feroza Aziz... In less than a few days, I was on Al-Jazeera, BBC, CNN... More than 1.5 million people watched it just on TikTok. What kind of responses have you had? Just from regular people... Half of them is positive, and the other half is, "Well, I don't know this is happening. "Why am I hearing this on TikTok and why not on the news?" I did, uhm, feel a little bit upset, though, because I thought, as if more attention was brought to me being silenced than to what I was actually speaking about. I remember seeing headlines saying, "Oh, Beijing-owned app takes down video." And not, "Oh, like, there's a Uyghur genocide happening." I felt very overwhelmed with the news coverage. One of my idols-- I have, like, her picture on my wall, mm, AOC retweeted an article of me. ♪ ♪ I didn't expect, uhm, politicians from China to even comment on it. China's Prime Ministry said it had no specifics of this case. You saying the content is still on the TikTok account? I'm not aware of the situation. How could I know what's happening on the account of one individual? I thought I had the freedom of speech, but I guess... under TikTok that's not possible for me to have that right. ♪ ♪ Content moderation is a process of determining what's appropriate and what's not appropriate online. One of the natural tensions becomes if you have a company but it's all throughout the globe, do you adjust to the cultural norms of another country? And a lot of people, when on Facebook or TikTok or Instagram, they talk about it by using concepts like freedom of speech, because all throughout society, specifically American society, we have debated. What's appropriate? How you balance individual autonomy and expression with the societal impact? That used to reside in governmental bodies. ♪ ♪ With social media, the power of determining speech has been far too consolidated. Major tech companies... if they have the power of deciding what's okay and what's not okay with what I say, if they have the power to deplatform. That puts a tremendous level of power in an unelected official. That's antidemocratic. ♪ ♪ I mean, the think about TikTok is it's, so it's--it's Chinese-owned, or just that, owners, they don't control it. In fact, TikTok takes a much, much stronger attitude against the sort of content that... well, that the Chinese government wouldn't like to see on a social media app. There's no orders coming down from up high, it's just the understanding that you will do what Beijing wants and you'll try and guess what they want and do it without being asked. ♪ ♪ You know, I might--I might go livestream on Duoyin a little bit. That's what's high on Duoyin. But... There's one problem, 'cause all the restrictions of my tattoos. They might shut me down. Here we go. We're live! Tattoos? No. And so the piercing? No. Ah! Sorry, sorry. Did you see that? Because I have tattoos, I can't--I can't go livestream. That's--that's really messed up. You know? Yeah, on Duoyin you have to watch everything that you say. Just one word... one frame could set your whole video off. For the first time in history, a person can write something or say something and have it reach a large segment of the world. So this brings up the topic of censorship, which is really tricky. The internet allows for the fastest spread of ideas in the history of the world. China with the great firewall and with government moderation has taken a very active hand in controlling what topics are discussed, what ideas are acceptable to discuss on the internet. We've never had to grapple with questions around censorship and in an era where so many people have a global megaphone now in their hands. ♪ ♪ It was back in late December when Dr. Li Wenliang first warned friends on WeChat about a SARS-like disease going around. Li sent a group message saying that a test result from a patient quarantined at the hospital where he worked showed a patient had a coronavirus, but hours after being sent, Wuhan City health officials tracked Li down, questioning where he got the information. Dr. Li sounded the alarm early in the COVID-19 outbreak. He soon faced government intimidation, and then contracted the virus. When he passed away, I was among many Chinese médecins who expressed grief and outrage at the events, only to have my account deleted. I felt guilt more than anger. At the time, I was a tech worker at ByteDance, where I helped develop tools and platforms for content moderation. In other words, I had helped build a system that censored accounts like mine. ♪ ♪ The technologies we created supported the entire company's content moderation, including Duoyin at home, and its international equivalent, TikTok. ♪ ♪ There was a long, constantly updated list of sensitive words, dates and names. If a user mentioned a sensitive term, they would shut down the ongoing livestream session and even suspend or delete their account. ♪ ♪ Many of my colleagues felt uneasy about what we were doing, but we all felt that there was nothing we can do. ♪ ♪ Dr. Li warned his colleagues and friends about an unknown virus. He was punished for that. Just imagine, had any social media platform been able to reject the government's censorship directives, perhaps millions of lives would have been saved today. ♪ ♪ TikTok faces government investigation in over seven countries, all citing concerns over national security and content moderation. ♪ ♪ In 2019, we had someone contact us, claiming to have internal information and access to internal TikTok moderation guidelines. And I don't think we realised, at the time, how big the story would get. What we saw was that TikTok was very explicit about what it wanted to have on the platform, and what it didn't want to show on the platform. ♪ ♪ TikTok rarely deletes content. They don't have to. They can just hide it. ♪ ♪ The guidelines were explicitly instructing moderators to deal with people who are LGBTQ or had disabilities or for whatever reason TikTok felt were vulnerable to bullying by hiding their content. So it was in Mandarin, and underneath a fairly awkward English translation, so it says subjects who is susceptible to bullying or harassment, based on their physical or mental condition. Example, facial disfigurement, autism, Down syndrome, disabled people or people with some facial problems, etc. Content of subjects likely to incite cyberbullying will be allowed, but marked with risk tag 4. Basically, and like... different levels of what we call "algorithmic punishment" or "algorithmic visibility," so they were put in a category called "Risk 4," which means that as soon as their videos would reach a certain threshold of views, they would automatically also be taken from the "For You" feed. ♪ ♪ Later on, other leaks surfaced. I actually have the ugly content policy right in front of me, So... crazy to read this. "Abnormal body shape, chubby, "ugly facial looks, "not limited to 'disformatted' face, "fangs, lack of front teeth, senior people with too many wrinkles..." And it just goes on and on, right? In a statement, TikTok said, "Earlier, we took a blunt approach "to minimising conflict on the platform... "Today we use local content moderation policies. "We want TikTok to be a space where everyone can safely and freely express themselves." It's just a lot of the "move fast and break things" attitude that we've seen from other Silicon Valley companies. It's not like only TikTok was doing these things. Obviously, the representation that we see in media is not an accurate picture of society, but I think there is a difference that, you know, no TV station, nor does Hollywood pretends to be open access to everybody, whereas this is a promise that social media platforms make. ♪ ♪ Am I the only one that has noticed that black creators get least favorite body algorithm? How is it that my followers are not seeing my video? What's up with that algorithm? I've had some of my TikTok videos get zero views, and I've been shadowbanned. Shadowbanning on TikTok is just when something in the algorithm that just kind of shuts you out completely. They just like find a way to make it so nobody sees any of your content. I am an apprenticing ocularist, an artist who works in the medical field, uh, making prosthetic eyes. TikTok's algorithm is very good. You know, you can create an account and within a couple of hours or a couple of days that algorithm knows who you are. You know? So for that same algorithm to kind of just... rip the rug out from thousands of Black creators, it kind of pulls you back for a second. We know the history that this nation has with Black people. We know the savagery that they had to endure because of colonisers, and the savagery that they still have to endure... I got on, and I had made a video talking about how my "For You" page was only of white creators and by that point, I would say I had... 150 to 200,000 followers. And so I had a video sitting, that I've published for three hours, and it said zero views. That was the first time where I was, like, this is blatant shadowbanning. Nobody's seeing us 'cause they're ensuring that nobody can. Tech troubles. TikTok says a technical glitch is making it appear as if posts with the hashtag and" The video platform says it's dealing with a display issue adding that videos featuring those tags have amassed more than two billion views. The moment you go to use a tag on TikTok, it'll tell you how many views, have been on that tag. And you go to write "black lives matter", and it says zero or, you know," "georgefloyd," "ahmaudarbery," anything. It would tell you zero. TikTok said in a statement, which reads in part, "First, to our Black community: We want to..." "Last week, a technical glitch made it "temporarily appear as if posts uploaded using "and "We understand that many assumed "it's bugged to be an intentional act "to suppress experiences and invalidate the emotions "felt by the Black community, and we know we have work to do to regain and repair that trust." Kind of like the normal check points that people go through. "We're growing, we're learning, we're trying to do better." I would love to believe that it was a technical glitch. 'Cause you're like, "That's absolutely possible. 100%," but it's so oddly specific that I can't attribute that to just being a glitch. TikTok has said that their content moderation has changed. Some of what you see on there backs that up. The sense that you see a lot of activism there. You saw Black Lives Matter content, eventually be up on there. But it's constantly changing, it's a constant black box. We have no idea what's going into any of these algorithms. And there's zero transparency. ByteDance, the Beijing-based owner of TikTok, apologised for the suspension, blaming a human moderation error. And TikTok says it doesn't apply Chinese moderation principles to its product outside of mainland China. After a few days, TikTok gave my account back. People don't seem to understand what it feels like to have someone try to take away your voice, and then they give it back to you. It's my voice, and them deciding to give me back my account after taking it away. It was as if... they could control what I could say and what I could do, and it's just disgusting to see an app do that. 'Til this day, my classmates will post on my social media accounts, leaving hate comments. I can delete the comments, but I'm gonna go to class the next day, and I'm gonna sit next to the person who hates my guts, for just speaking on issues I believe must be spoken about. When you're so invested on apps like TikTok, when something bad happens on social media, your life is torn apart. ♪ ♪ Story time. We all worked on the Kamala Harris campaign, in the presidential primary. And this is your sign to get a tattoo with your work besties. For the people. I was 19 years old when I started on the Kamala Harris campaign. I withdrew my sophomore year at Columbia. And it was a huge move. I think that our perspective as young people is what led us to think TikTok is important. There's a lot of young people there. We were the first campaign that was putting content on TikTok directly. I feel like we have to take a moment for this... this. Oh, thank you. Oh. Yes. All of Yessica's iconic shots. So good. I mean, you pioneered vertical video. I--I love that shot in the rain. She was booging it down. That one was everywhere. I love that. I just remember, like, all those airplane videos really making the rounds on TikTok. Absolutely. They were showing up everywhere. And it was interesting to see the progression. Like, when different candidates started to have, like, their official TikToks and what kind of content did they make on TikTok. I think we felt like we were kind of starting to hit our stride on TikTok, and then we, like, had to stop. That email, that dreadful, dreadful email we got. The dark day when we were told that we couldn't be on TikTok anymore. When I get this email that, because of security reasons, we were all being asked to delete TikTok on government and military phones... That was a sad email. That was a tough one. TikTok ownership by a Chinese parent company subject to Chinese surveillance law has made the app's popularity problematic, causing concerns from the US Army, the Navy, the TSA, the DNC, the RNC, and the Biden campaign, all banning TikTok from their phones. For many young soldiers in the military who were using TikTok, they were in all sorts of US military bases around the world, and said they would go and they would do pushup contests. They would, you know, do tours of the bases, then... You know, they were really showing some pretty... top secret assets to anyone in the world wanting to see them, and this was at a moment where... people were not taking TikTok seriously. But what they realised was this silly little kids app was collecting a ton of information on GPS, on location, of all these soldiers, and all of that, in the end, was heading back into a Chinese company. ♪ It took too long, it took too long ♪ ♪ It took too long for you to call back ♪ ♪ And normally I would just forget that... ♪ From a nation state's perspective, well, data is the new oil. If I can understand the connections between people, I can start to target my misinformation, so that one person is likely to take actions in the real world, like vote. So the data that TikTok collects is on par with what other social media companies are collecting. So, the question really becomes, "Why is TikTok being picked on?" Xenophobia should certainly be considered a part, as part of this, we've seen a rise in hate crimes against Asian-Americans, and so I think, being very clear about the differences, uh, of the practices of a government versus the people that happen to reside inside of that nation state. After all, I don't agree with 100% of the things our nation does. ♪ I'm singing Trump 2020 ♪ ♪ Trump 2020 ♪ ♪ Trump 2020, Trump 2020 ♪ ♪ ♪ When I first found Gen-Z comedians online, it was so inspiring to me as a comedian, in seeing how easy it is to build traction on apps like TikTok. One of my friends had posted that Donald Trump's Tulsa rally had free tickets, and my first thought was just how easy is it to get a ticket. Guys, Donald Trump is having a rally. All you had to do is give your phone number and so I got two tickets, but I totally forgot that I had to pick every individual piece of lint off of my floor, and then sort them by size, so I can't... make it for Friday. I had realised the potential of this. You should be really careful going to do this, you know. You don't want a bunch of empty seats. And when I posted it, I didn't think much of it... ♪ ♪ ...but in two days it just blew up. Oh, my God! I just registered for Trump's rally, and I'm so excited to not go. Mm-hmm. We've never had an empty seat. And we certainly won't in Oklahoma. TikTok users may well be President Trump's latest adversary, after thousands of people who've gotten tickets online didn't show up, thanks to a secret campaign on TikTok. We've gotten over a million tickets sold and only 6,000 people showed up. President Trump was frustrated and angry. TikTok is definitely giving teenagers new power. I think it's unbelievable that I was able to prank an American President. Trump nemesis, New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, gloated. As soon as that rally happened, that's when the rhetoric on TikTok rose to a level that we hadn't seen before. The real China hawks in his Administration were ready to go after this company, and then were kind of waiting for the moment, and this rally and the pandemic came together to give them that moment that they needed. The Pentagon, the Department of State, the Department of Homeland Security, and the TSA have all banned their employees and service members from using TikTok on government devices, and we know that it's a national security risk. People really pounced on this moment, not only the China hawks and the US government, but also the tech companies, particularly Facebook. Do you believe that the Chinese government steals technology from US companies? Uh, Congressman, I think it's well documented that the Chinese government steals technology from American companies. And so Mark Zuckerberg saw this as a moment and Facebook pounced on this moment, where TikTok was getting under pressure, and he said, "I'm gonna turn this up even more." And so they started making their case to the different people in Congress who were really going after Facebook, and they were saying, "You know what? "You're looking at us as the Boogeyman, "but we're just a distraction, "from the real problem, "which are the Chinese tech companies, "and those are the companies that you should be looking at." Now the "Wall Street Journal" is reporting that... Not only did Mark Zuckerberg publicly go against TikTok, he lobbied behind the scenes against the company, in a private dinner with the President. There was a moment during the pandemic where cases were going up, we didn't have a vaccine, Donald Trump's campaign wasn't doing so well, and so Donald Trump started really hammering this idea home that we need to blame China for the Coronavirus, and this pandemic. "Kung-flu." The Chinese virus. Why do you keep using this? - Because it comes from China. - Sounds racist. It's not racist at all. No. Not at all. It comes from China. Trump loved that. He wanted to play to that, because it became this kind of rallying cry in the US to go after China, and TikTok kind of became, um, this symbol of China at that moment. There have been more than 2,500 incidents of anti-Asian hate crimes. It's not just in the US, Asians around the world have reported discrimination linked to Coronavirus. Asian hate, it didn't just started now. It was always there. It was always there. Suddenly, because of the pandemic, TikTok became this symbol of this fight between the US and China, and a way for Donald Trump to kind of deflect blame. It all started last Friday, when President Trump send shockwaves through social media after making this comment. We're looking at TikTok. We may be banning TikTok. The President threatened to block the popular video app, citing national security concerns. No. We're--we're not a national security threat. And we've said that time and again, we have very strict data access and controls. TikTok has said, "American user data is stored in the US, "and backed up in Singapore, not in China." We are at a time when we're seeing a very much... a geopolitical tension, as you know, between the US and China, and we are in the middle of that. In China, there is this cyber security law that states, "If we ask you for information, then you have to give it to us." The 2017 law mandates that Chinese-owned companies have to cooperate with the Communist Party. And so that's kind of the heart of the problem. TikTok can swear up and down that they've never been asked to give information, but that doesn't stop the Chinese government from taking information in the future. I remember this moment, where we had the pandemic, we had Black Lives Matter protests, we have wildfires in California, like the world feels like it's falling apart and the only thing people on the news are talking about is this ban of TikTok. Just the threat alone has already had a huge impact. Advertisers have been hitting pause on campaigns, worth millions of dollars... It caused absolute chaos in the tech industry, like Apple and Google, and everyone was sort of struggling to get a handle on it, and thinking, "Can a president even do this?" Yo, what's up, guys? I'm sure all you guys heard the news. TikTok's getting banned. I'm... going across TikTok, and all my friends are saying bye to TikTok "It's so sad I have to leave you, guys." There's another one saying, "Please follow me on all my other social media." And I was fearing for my career. ♪ But it's done now ♪ I have five million followers. How can this get banned? This is my living, it's what I do. And I'm starting a video petition with You all mean the world to me. Thank you for everything. Thank you for a career.

A few days after the executive order, we hear that Microsoft is in deal talks to buy TikTok. Then we started hearing, "Okay, well, maybe Oracle "wants to buy TikTok, "maybe all these other companies, you know, "because if they bought TikTok then it would no longer be owned by a Chinese company," and suddenly that would be okay for Donald Trump, and, oh, by the way, Donald Trump also wanted to take a finder's fee to get some money to the Treasury, which is probably the most bizarre plot of the entire storyline. ♪ ♪ TikTok kept saying, "We're trying to find a deal, we're trying to find a deal," but, in the meantime, nothing was actually happening, and then the Chinese government stepped in. Tonight, state media have been lashing out, once again, saying that Beijing would, quote, undoubtedly prepare proportional countermeasures for what it says could become piracy and looting by United States. All of a sudden, came this law that banned the export or sale of any artificial intelligence from China. ByteDance and TikTok at its core is an AI company. And that was really what stopped the discussion. And could prevent the sale of TikTok. TikTok is one of the opening salvos in an emerging battle of technology between the world's two largest and most dynamic economies. A new tech cold war. And then, the November US Presidential Elections started heating up, and the story of TikTok became the biggest deal of the century that never actually ended up happening, because Donald Trump lost the Presidency, Biden took over and we never revisited it. Well, it turns out the clock won't stop for TikTok. President Biden has signed a new executive order, voiding the Trump-era decision seeking to ban the social media app. Everybody, calm down. Calm down. TikTok is not getting banned. I just love how Trump tried to ban TikTok. And now TikTok has banned Trump. TikTok is just one app in what is going to be a long line of applications and new ways of communicating. And so acknowledging our own humanity in this.

TikTok has infiltrated American culture, the Hollywood and entertainment system, and--and politics, and all of these different facets of American life in--in such a deep way. There's very legitimate reasons to think critically about the impact that this massive tech conglomerate is having on America and it's really important to think about issues around data privacy with all of these tech platforms. It's called the Log Off movement, and it's a nonprofit organisation. It's really been started by kids, for ways to promote healthy ways to exist on social media. I'm really inspired by the Log Off movement, they're a group of high school students from all over the planet. They're not just telling people to spend less time on the apps. They're pushing back by talking to members of Congress, by talking to people at the platforms themselves, to try to change how these systems are built. Companies like TikTok need to be watched, they need to be held accountable the same way that we hold other institutions of power accountable. TikTok has tightened the privacy measures. Anybody under 15 will automatically have a private account. Federal regulators have already ordered the app to disclose how its practices do effect young people. Personally, I don't think it's fair to single out an individual company just because it's popular. Personally, I think it makes more sense to pass cohesive laws against all companies, so that not only can TikTok not do some of this, so neither can Facebook or Google, or Amazon or any other companies, regardless of nationality. If the story ended today, I would say, hands down, TikTok won. All the Trump ban did was make TikTok even bigger, because it caused people to download the app, it caused people to talk about it, and so all it did was create more growth and more revenue for this Chinese company that is even bigger in the US than it was when Trump first started going after it.
