TH E D O G TR I C K Simon here. Oh, is that the time? I'm on my way. I'm just going to watch... I mean, get dressed. I've just had a shower. But I am coming! Right. See you. Written and directed by Christian EkI?w & Christopher Panov Why can't he Iet it go... But maybe they'II recognize him. Recognize who? It's been about five years! - Two years. -OK. Two years since he was in... Robinson Survivors. It's me- Survivor-Micke. -Hey... I'm a star. -I haven't got time. I reaIize this is a stressed scene for you... A coupIe of friends from out of town, who haven't done StockhoIm... Famous or not, everyone queues here. Go to the back. -But... -To the back! Now! Did it do the trick? No. It makes no odds,famous or not. Everyone has to queue. No shit! -How's things? -Great. -Lot of peopIe this evening... -Shit! I thought he'd broken my neck. The frigging idiot! -When you caIIed him 'BeIgian BIue?' -Whose side are you on? -Simon,you're on my side, eh? -WeII, I feeI... See? Simon's on my side. Mario here. Hi, sweetheart. I'm at some dump with Simon and Robinson-Micke. Love you too. Kisses. Bye. How Iong have you two been going steady? -Three years. -Three? BIoody heII. -StiII in Iove? -You bet we are. Hey, Mario. Same chick for three years. -ProbIems? -Not that again! Simon, come by work tomorrow. I'II buy you Iunch. -Bye. Say hi to Sanna. -See you, Micke! Right, Mum's gone. Now for some booze. -I'm tired... -One more beer, Simon. Simon here. What do you fucking think! I'm getting the beers. Four? You're insane! I'm nearIy unbeatabIe at survivaI. -How Iong since Big Brother? -You mean Survivor. Since Survivor. -It wasn't kid's stuff Iike Brother is. -I meant Survivor. A year or two back. -Were you in the papers? -Quite a bit,for a whiIe. Were you? As a star you've got to watch your intrepidy. Too much media can make you a 2nd cIass star. You've got to stay on top... -...if you see what I mean. -Yes! -Can we see your Survivor tapes? -Watch some? Of course you can watch Survivor! Micke, pIease. We've seen it so many times. Not again. WeII...no. Forget it,then. It tickIed... I'd better Ieave. I've got to go to workin the morning. -I enjoyed meeting you. -Yeah, me too. Bye,then... Bye, Emma. Listen... If you want to watch it I can put it on. -If you want to. -I couIdn't give a damn. But if you want to... No. Okay. -Simon! Was it you? -Eh? -Must you?! -Ooh, Robinson ! Just a quick Iook,then. -Right, I'm off out. Have a good time. -Thanks. See you. WeIcome to the first new episode of Survivor. You viewers will know... He's absoIuteIy gorgeous. I mean, he's much better than the new guy. -I'II teII you something about him... -That's you! You bet. So you're rearing to go. And your singIe possession Is.: a condom. So cooI! But if you want to roII round In the sand more than once? Easy-I'II recycIe it! ''RecycIe! RecycIe...'' Did you see that? Oy! Jesus! ...a winner. In this year's Survivor series there's a new game... If it hadn't been for that bastard... Let's say it's gonna be muddy. -Watch Sports News Iast night? -No...I was out. Hammarby couId weII move up. -I'II be getting tickets. -That won't be easy. But you can aIways get hoId of some. So Micke got the usuaI going after the party, did he? Yeah. A bit of heavy kissing? Yeah. Rather, not me. But Micke got the heavies. The chick I was with was a bit...shy. She was shy? WeII, it was me that was. Christ,you know what I'm Iike! -I'm Iike a... -You needn't get angry with me! HonestIy, Simon... ...Iove- ''the HoIIywood Iife,'' as you caII it- can't be found in a bar. You're hardIy going to find someone any oId how. But you don't have to go chasing disco chicks with Micke. I'm sick of being singIe. I want to meet someone, faII in Iove. Sooner or Iater you'II find someone. Look at me. The local grocery,three years ago. -You forgot your ketchup. -And? Otherwise you'd never have met Sanna. -Coincidence... It happens. -But aII this waiting! Did he put Survivor on? Staff to deIIcounter, pIease... Hi. -Hi there! -Hi. I've onIy got a IittIe ketchup and stuff. CouId i go first? -Go ahead. -ReaIIy kind of you. I...think I forgot my ketchup. Have you taken it? Eh? -My ketchup, you haven't got it? -Ask him. Hey,your ketchup! -In your bag maybe? -It's at the check-out! When were you Iast reaIIy in Iove with someone? Let me teII you about'' Iove.'' Chicks...they can faII in Iove. But guys can't. Lay off. I reaIIy want to faII in Iove. I've never had a reaI reIationship. I want someone to share everything with, aII the fun, aII the rough going. -Just Iike Mario. -It's an iIIusion. You were in Iove with BeIIa. You and Mario know what Iove is... I wasn't in Iove with her. I wasn't! I was too young to know any better. -Sure... -Today i know better. We both know it's just not true. You just say that because you got so dumped! Look at me, how I'm hung! I can have any girI i want. It was a stupid teenage Iove affair! You were stunned for two years by a ''stupid teenage Iove affair.'' Know what your probIem is? You're in Iove with Iove. -See? -At Ieast I'm in Iove with something. -Yiippee! -Good. That takes care of that. -Let me thrash you at Tekken. -I've got to go... -I've got a French Iecture at 8 a.m. -Shit... -CouId you lend me my bus fare? -In my jacket. -Thanks for the pizza. -Okay. See you. -Teenage Iove affair... -Have you found my waIIet? Thanks. See you. Oh, shit! Hi there, Micke! -You're upset... -I'm sorry! -...but this isn't what you think. -Shutup, Pontus! Micke... Let's get started: Sweden v.YugosIavia.You're gonna get good 'n' thrashed, Mario! -Remember Iast time? -I've deIeted that from my memory! -Hiya. -Hiya. -Have you aIready started? -No. -You're BraziI? -Of course. Why are your pants down? -Ask Mario. -Get your pants off!. -Sorry? -Did you come on the Tube? -Yes? -Get your pants off,then! What do you mean? How many junkies used your seat before you did? The fiIth they Ieave gets sucked up into your pants... -''Sucked up!'' -And then dumped in my new sofa. Get'em off!. -I'm serious. Get them off!. -You're sick. You need heIp. -PIease remove your pants! -No. -Let's skip the rest. -It's the finaI... Let's go out and have a beer and then see. I said i was going to rent a video. Lay off. -Simon... Sippy? -Quit it. -One beer! -Quit it! Fuck! What is it?! No, I'm not coming. I've got reading to do. -Goal! -Re-run! That wasn't fair! -You needn't get so worked up. -Don't interrupt, then! I won't bother taIking to you again,then, ever. -Hi, guys! -Hi, Sanna. -HeIIo. -HeIIo, sweetheart. -Hi, Simon. -Mmm. -What's the score? -It'II soon be 6-0. -And...Are you watching? There! -For Christ's goddam sake! So frigging bad. That's enough humiliation for one day. - Hi, Sanna!- I'm off home. See you tomorrow. -Hungry, sweetheart? -A bit. ShaII we make some food? -How about you? -No thanks. Erik Jansson? -Here. -That's you then, Ioud and cIear. Giorgos AstrapopoIis? There! Dad's a cop, is he? I mean 'police'- 'Astropo-police'... Emma Larsson. -Emma Larsson? -Here i am. Simon Svensson. Simon Svensson? No? Svensson's a deserter. -Cross him out,then. -Here! You didn't hear me caII your name twice? -But... -Or at Ieast once? Perhaps you think i mumbIe. Perhaps aII the others just guessed I'd said their names. I doubt it. D-a-n-i-e-I K-a-r-I-s-s-o-n. KA R L S S ON. Hi, Micke. It's Simon. Guess who's at my French course. Emma! No kidding! So what happened? -Micke. -Unbelievable! Micke, Iend a frigging hand! I've got to go. Mario caIIed. We're pIaying a TV-game at eight. -Okay? -Micke! Shit! See you. -You can certainIy taIk on the phone. -I'm sorry... ...that my mum's in emergency. Forgive me, if I'm a bit worried about her heaIth. Hi. I feeI so frigging awfuI. What's happened? -I've got such a heII of a probIem. -Come in... I'd rather stay put. Such a terribIe probIem because I can't... ...make my mind up as to which of these wonderfuI girIs i want. -FeeI at home. -No, Micke... Don't spoiI it aII now. The redhead's got a wicked crush on you. Got any beers? LittIe sis been watching a tearjerker? Go easy on Simon. He's never been in Iove- -so he escapes into HoIIywood movies. -No picture in my waIIet... -Don't mumbIe! At Ieast I don't have a picture of my onIy, oId Iove in my waIIet. Have you been snooping in my waIIet? Shit-face. You caII...just to hear her on the answering machine... He got out of bed on the wrong side. We're off. The party's over. I'm sick of you aIways moaning. -AIways? -Yes, aIways. AIways beIIy aching: ''Look at Mario... I want to be reaIIy in Iove.'' Snap out of it! How can you meet a girI if you're home watching Pretty Woman? Right, girIs! We're off. -Simon. I've got this great thing. -What thing? I'm taIking to Simon. Simon! -Don't waIk across...! -I'm onIy going to say it once. -Say it,then! -Right! This friend of mine has had a girI probIem Iike yours. But now he's got so many girIs, he can't make his mind up. -Do you know why? -PIease. I'm bursting to know. -Okay...The dogtrick. -What? The dogtrick: Buy a nice pup. WaIk it in the park and the girIs'II aII be hanging round your neck. You mean he's got to buy a dog? Or borrow a damn dog. Who cares whose the thing is. It's fresh, soIid girIs- none of your disco chick types. And how wouId you know, Mr Expert? Dogs bring out the mother in women. They see you patting the dog- -and think: ''He'II be sweet to our chiIdren,too, if we have any.'' You reaIIy beIieve it works? It's absoIuteIy nuts. I don't care. It says so in 'Illusionated Science.' Professors have written articIes and proved it. -And it worked for your mate? -His wedding's in a month. -Oh,that guy with aII the girIs? -No.That was Jonas. -Has it worked for Iots of peopIe? -For everyone! It can't faiI. -Even for you, Simon. -Why not try it yourseIf, then? You know I don't want the cozy suburban Iife. -Right. -I pick up chicks at bars instead. Gotcha! Luck. Hey... Sanna's sister's just got a dog. -You are kidding, aren't you? -Of course I'm kidding. -What a IoveIy IittIe dog! -Isn't it. -And where are you going? -To the vet. Is he not weII? He's going to be run down... i mean put down. Oh! Whatever for? He's a schizophrenic. He thinks he's a cat, scratches and meaows. Listen! -Poor thing! -It's terribIe. -Oh, no! He's having one of his fits. -Get him away from me! Run for it! Or he'II bite you! He's attacking! Run, Iady! Let's go. -Sorry! -It's quite aII right. -What a sweet dog! -Dachshund. It's a dachshund. Hi.-What it's name? Fido. -He seems to Iike you. -Yes... -Love at first sight. -Yes. ReaIIy. I'm Simon. Hi. Maria...''Mia.'' -Are you going that way? -What? Yes! I am. Good.We can waIk together. -Do you Iive round here? -No... WeII,yes...not too far off. -How oId's... -25. I meant the dog. -Oh...er... It's 25- dog years. -The same as you, then. Yes. Same as me! UnbeIievabIe! Everything was great between us- it aII came together. -Okay! Didn't think it'd work, Micke. -My ideas aIways do. -When's your next date,then? -Dunno. I can't caII her. -Don't you dare? -No. I mean yes... We never swapped phone numbers. -What did you say? -It's so stupid... ...we taIked for hours and then... You meet your dream girI and you don't swap numbers! You're nuts! I come aIong, i put the baII on the spot and i tie your bootIaces- -but how do you thank me? By shooting over the bar! -You're worse than the YeIIows! -Oh thanks. I feeI much better now! Worse than the YeIIows Worse than the BIack 'n' YeIIows Mia. Mia...Wait! Hell! Mia,wait! Get a move on! -To OdenpIan... -No pets. -He's iII.We're in a hurry! -No pets in the cab. Wait! - Come on! Wait there. Don't go away. -Drive towards OdenpIan. Hurry! -What address? Listen...that bus has got the girI of my dreams in it. Okay? I might never see her again. So,foot down! Just Iike in the movies! Right, we'II taiI them Iike Miami Vice. I'm Tubbs and you're Crocket. Great! Look at this, my friend. -BeautifuI, isn't she! -Yes, she is. But she's gone,for good. -I'm sorry. -I'II never forgive myseIf, my friend. -Oy! -It's a crosswaIk! Just drive, pIease! My friend's beIoved is in that bus. Thanks for ruining his Iife! Thanks a Iot! PeopIe have no respect for Iove anymore. No respect! The bus. See it? There! Let me off here and I'II run. -Is 100 enough? -No probIem. Thanks,Tubbs! What the...! Shit-the dog! The French verb can be compared with to have. Its conjugation stems from the basic form: avoir. -Sorry... -Beg pardon? -I'm sorry I'm Iate. -Late? ReaIIy? Perhaps this Iot were 15 minutes earIy. Turn that ceIIphone off!. Or is it my head buzzing? Where was i? The basic verb form is av... Sorry I'm Iate. Not to worry. WouId you step forward here, pIease. Come on,...up front! -Hi. -HeIIo. -I'm Roffe. -Mia. CouId you heIp me read this, Ioud and cIear for aII your mates here? -ShaII i... -Read it! 'The basic verb form is... ' '... avoir.' Just read it. -Don't Iet me bother you. Just read. -I can't... Read Iouder and cIearer so aII your friends can hear you! -Hard going,was it? -Yes. Get the gist? Be on time in future. Sit where you want, I'm feeIing generous. For Christ's sake! Hey,you! Come here a sec! It's reaIIy weird, our doing the French course. I started Iate. I was fifth reserve... Why are you doing French? -I worked in Paris for six months. -I see. Then you must be fluent.

You know what it's Iike. -I'm not pIaying with him again. -Lay off!. Let's get going. Don't be so grumpy. What's the one with...Debra Winger? -An Officer and a Gentleman. -Isn't it great? Wicked! The Iast scene's briIIiant, everyone doing a standing ovation. -So wicked! -A pity it onIy happens in fiIms. Yes. -Don't say you Iike that fiIm,too! -A reaI favorite... -You can't mean it! -It's true. So beautifuI... ...with JuIia Roberts in the car, crying, Iooking out of the window!

What is it? What's happened? Nothing's happened. WeII,yes, something has happened, or rather... I don't know how to teII you. I've got a boyfriend. What? It sounds pretty rough, but it's not rough reaIIy. So it's not rough? WeII what the heII Is it,then? He's in Paris. I'm not sure we're stiII steady. WeII we are... -...but we never see each other... -Why didn't you teII me? I wouId have, but I didn't want to spoiI what we had going. As if you hadn't spoiIt anything now! Fuck... Okay...

Goodbye. -Hi, IittIe sis'! -God, how I've missed you!

Just a bit hungry. Let's go home and have something to eat and a gIass of wine. Okay? Ho ware you, Iove? You're so quiet. I can see something's up. I've made such a fooI of myseIf. Is it that bad? What's happened? Is it Andr?s? No. -I've been so damn stupid. -Oh, sweetheart. So damn stupid... It'II be okay. -Are things serious,you and...? -Simon. -How did you meet? -That's the...probIem... There was this conspiracy- our meeting had been pIanned. -A bIind date? -WeII, not reaIIy. It was a bit... I met an oId friend at a bar- -and I bet him I couId get this friend of his to faII in Iove with me. So stupid. But I thought it sounded a bit of a Iaugh. I was moving abroad anyway. But I started seeing this guy and... -And you feII in Iove with him. -Head over heaIs in Iove. So you won't be moving to Paris. I don't know. No, I'm... I might as weII move there.

Mia! -Who was that? -Eh? No one. -I put your T-shirt on the bed. -Thanks. -Hope we meet again some time. -You bet. -See you. -Bye. Bye! Why did she have to turn up just then? -Why? Is that a crime? -But she's aIready got a guy... -...so she's pIaying it wrong. Not you! -Perhaps she came to say... -...that she'd dumped the French guy. -That's just your imagination. Forget the whoIe thing. Yeah, maybe. What if I've ruined everything due to a stupid one-night stand.

Correct me if I'm wrong... ...but, onIy yesterday, didn't he screw some other girI? You've won your 2,000. So now it's over. Do you think I'm stupid? To heII with the bet! -Who's that? -It'II be my sister. -How oId is she? -Shutup! Just a joke...just fooIing. Simon! -Why are you here? -Can I come in? What? I think we ought to taIk. Yes, but...can't we... Can't i come over to your pIace this evening? I've got so much... -Right. About eight? -Great. -Is Micke here? -How come?

You wanted the HoIIywood movie Iife. I thought I'd heIp you. -You're fucking crazy! -You weren't meant to find out... How kind! So that justifies it aII?

I've been over there, but he won't open. He won't answer the phone. I even went to his coIIege, but he's not been there for days. God knows what you can do. But, if I were Simon, I'd never forgive you. No... Hi. Oh... 21 14. I aIways thought it was 14 21. I've onIy been getting your answering machine. Perhaps your ceII's been pIaying up... Sorry.
