Who's there? What are you doing there? - What you doing? - Looking for something. A lot of nonsense. Haven't seen anything, have you? What do you mean, "seen anything"? Oh, nothing, nothing. Mysterious, aren't you? Oh, it's you. Been taking your time, haven't you? Your cat's been screaming her head off for you. Oh, what's she want now? - There's trouble for you, me girl. - Why? What's up? She's found two broken cups and saucers from the best crown derby tea set buried in the Rose bed. Ooh, whatever did she say? Oh, said it didn't matter and I was to kiss you and tell you she loved you all the better for it. What do you think? Ooh, what am I going to do? When did you break them? Yesterday when you was out. I don't know what come over me. I don't know what's come over you all this week. Ever since bank holiday, you've been going about looking like two penn'orth of heaven help us, losing things and dropping things. Is that Dora come back? Dora! What am I going to do? Do? Make a clean breast of it. Tell her if she don't like it, she can do the other thing. I would. Dora, I want you. Dora! Oh, dear. Oh, auntie, leave the poor girl alone. Leave her alone, the little sneak thief? Oh, there you are. - Did you want me? - I called you, didn't I? I suppose you think the China here came from the penny bazaar. Thought if you planted them in the Rose bed, I shouldn't be well enough ever to see them, I suppose? Well, I have seen. Oh! That hurts. Don't be so clumsy. Do you want to break my arm? Come, come, Dora, it isn't as bad as all that. Not as bad as all that? It's worse. What about that chicken you stole on Monday? I never stole it. Well, I don't know what else you'd call it. Borrowed it, perhaps? But auntie, dear, you've been through all that already. You keep out of this. I don't know what's come over you, I really don't. Clumsy, thieving, deceitful. You can leave. - You're sacked, my girl. - Oh, mum! And stop that sniveling and squeaking! You'll bring my heart on again. Go into the kitchen. Oh, mum, please don't send me away. I haven't got a penny, only what I earn. If I lose my job here... You should have thought of that before you broke my China. I'm sorry. I've not been myself all this week. Hmm, so I've noticed. Is anything the matter, Dora? You're not in any trouble, are you? Yes, miss, I am, in a manner of speaking. Oh? A man, eh? So that's the game. Men, too. Not men. Just my friend. He promised to marry me, but he keeps making excuses, and I know he isn't keen. Who is he? A boy I know. A pageboy at the tallboys. Good-for-nothing scoundrel. Oh, no, he isn't! He's nice, really, if you know what I mean. No, I don't. Where's he come from? He's sort of Irish, I think. He's been to sea, too. He's funny, of course. Ever so open. Baby-face, they call him. Baby-face? I'd like to give him baby-face. Oh, mum? Well, what? You wouldn't see him, would you? See him? Not to tell him off, I don't mean, but perhaps if you was to speak to him, he might see things differently. He will when I've done with him. As a matter of fact, mum, he said he might be popping in this morning to see me. Oh, that's right. Nothing like visitors to brighten up your morning, eh? Send him in when he comes. I'll deal with him. Yes, mum. And mum? And I'll stop that crown derby out of your wages. Oh. What were you going to say? Well, I was going to say I don't know how to thank you for your kindness. There. Done. How does it feel? Not much better. I know it's neuritis. You know, what you really need isn't massage, it's exercise. Your body will... Don't you dictate to me about my body. Nobody here understands my body or anything else about me. As for sympathy, I've forgotten the meaning of the word. Too bad. Well, I'll be getting along. Might call in on Wednesday, in case my neuritis sets in again. I'll do that, and if paralysis pops up, let me know. Toodle-oo! That's a nice way to talk to an invalid. What do you want? There's a policeman at the back door. A policeman? He said he was a policeman. He isn't in his uniform, though. Said he wants to see you, very particular. What about? I don't know. Better ask him. I know my conscience is clear. I don't know about other people's, I'm sure. He's probably come about Dora. Why? What she's done is not against the law. It's human nature. Where is he? Coming round to the front door. Come in. Thank you. - Mrs. Bramson? - Yes? I'm sorry to break in on you like this. My card. "Criminal investigation department?" A purely informal visit, I assure you. I don't like having people in my house that I don't know. Well, I'm afraid the law sometimes makes it necessary. Oh, thank you. You can go. I don't want to go. I want to hear what's up. Well, as a matter of fact, I'd like you to stay. You may be useful. Any of you may be useful. Do you live here? Catch me. Well, it is a lonely spot, isn't it? Long way for you to walk every day. I don't walk, I ride a bike. Oh. What's the matter? Well, I just thought if she walked, she might have used some paths around here. - She might have seen something. - Something of what? I'll tell you. I... Perhaps I better introduce myself. I'm Mrs. Bramson's niece. I work for her. Or pretends to. I see. Thank you. Well, now, I wonder if any of you have seen anything in the least bit out of the ordinary around here lately. Anybody call? Anybody strange wandering about in the woods? The only visitors have been the doctor and the district nurse. It's been ever so gay. Well, miss Grayne's always moping about the woods. She may be able to tell you something. Yes? No, no, I haven't seen anything, I'm afraid. Oh. Yes, I did see some men beating the undergrowth. Yes. I'm coming to that. What's all this fuss about? Has there been a robbery or something? No. There's a lady missing... oh? From the tallboys... A Mrs. Chalbrook. Chalbrook? Oh, yes. Dyed platinum blond. Widow of a colonel, so she says. Living alone, so she says. Always wearing them fladelaldy openwork stockings. Fond of a drop, too. That's her. Do you know her? Never set eyes on her, but you know how people talk. Regular red-hot mama, from what I'm told. And what's a red-hot mama? Don't you ever go to the pictures? Well, anyway, she hasn't been seen since last Monday. That was bank holiday. She was given to walking in the woods a great deal, in this direction. She was probably so drunk she fell flat and has never come to. No. We've had the woods pretty well thrashed. Those would be the men you saw. She was a very flashy... No, she isa flashy type of woman, I should say, at least I hope I should say. What do you mean? Why do you hope? You don't mean to say she may... - May not be alive? - It's possible. You'll be saying she's been murdered next. Well, that's been known. A lot of stuff and nonsense... From a policeman, too. One would think you'd been brought up on detective stories. Well, I'd be very grateful to you if you'd all just keep your eyes and your ears open, just in case. Good morning, Mrs. Bramson. Good-bye. Good morning, miss, uh... Oh, I'm so sorry. Why? What's the matter? Have you just thought of something? Oh, no. No. Then what was it? You were looking strange, as if you'd just thought of something. No. It's nothing, really. I was only thinking that... What? Well, I often wonder on a very fine morning what it will be like for night to come, and I never can. Yet it has to. Silly. I should think it was. No. Go on. Well, here we all are, perfectly ordinary English people. We woke up this morning thinking, "here's another day." We got up, looked at the weather, talked. Here we all are still talking. And all the time... What? All the time, there may be something lying in the woods, hidden under a bush, with two feet showing, perhaps a high heel catching the sunlight, with a bird perched on the end of it. And the other? The other's a stocking foot with blood that's dried in the stocking. Somewhere... somewhere there's a man walking about and talking just like us. And he got up this morning, and he looked at the weather, and he killed her. Well! Miss Grayne, you give me the creeps. I don't think the lady can quite describe herself as ordinary after that little flight of fancy. I hope she's wrong, anyway, or it will be a nice little job of work for us. Well, now, if anything funny happens, just call them up at Shepperly police station. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Don't bother. Good morning. A lot of nonsense. I wonder. Of course you wonder. Anything for a bit of excitement, I suppose. If you please, mum. What? What is it? If you please, he's here. Who's here? My boyf... gentleman friend from the tallboys. Bring him in. I'm ready for him. I'm going to make that young man realize what his duty is. That's what I'm going to do. Well? Morning, all. So you're baby-face. That's me. Silly name, isn't it? I must apologize to all and sundry for my fancy dress, but it's my working togs. I've been on duty this morning and I... My hands isn't very clean. I didn't know it was going to be a party. Party? Well, it's ladies, isn't it? Are you shy with ladies? Oh, yes. You don't seem to be very shy with Dora there. Well, I... you, go away. Yes, mum. You smoke, I see. Yes, I... I am sorry. Forget my manners in company. Clumsy in other people's houses. I am sorry. Now, then. You know what I've sent to see you about. Yes. I think so. You ought to be ashamed of yourself. Oh, but I am. Well, then... what time is it? About 11:30, I think. Olivia? - Yes, auntie? - You've forgotten again! What? My medicine! It's half an hour late. I'm so sorry. You know it doesn't do me any good unless I take it regularly. Unless I see to every single thing myself in this house, nothing gets done. Oh, filthy stuff. Get me a chocolate. A lot of good you are to look after an invalid. You work at the tallboys, don't you? Yes, miss. 24 hours a day, miss. Can you tell us anything about the woman who's been murdered? You know there's a Mrs. Chalbrook missing, don't you? I thought you said something about a murder. A lot of nonsense. We don't know, of course, but there might have been a murder. Yes, there might have been a murder. Yes. Have you ever seen her? Yes, I've seen her. I've taken drinks and cigarettes up to her. What's she like? What's she like? She's on the tall side, thin ankles, with one of them bracelets around one of them, fair hair. Well, go on. Her eyebrows, thin, with a white Mark above them where they've been pulled out to be in the fashion. Her mouth, thin as well, with red stuff painted 'round it to make it look more. You can rub it off, I suppose. Her neck... Rather thick. She laughs a bit loud... And then stops. She's very lively. You can't say I don't keep my eyes skinned, can you? Are you always so observant? With the ladies, you know. If he weren't so observant, that Dora wouldn't find herself in the flummox she is now. Ha ha! That's right. You don't sound very repentant. Oh, but I am. What's done is done. That's my motto, isn't it? Now, what does that mean? She's a fine bit of ice for hot weather, isn't she? Now, look here, young man, about Dora. How long have you known her? Not very long. The butcher wants pay. Does he? He says there's men ferreting at the bottom of the garden looking for that Mrs. Chalbrook. And do you know about it? Well, they won't ferret long, not in my pampas grass. Olivia! She's never there when I want her. No, no, no! Leave me alone. I don't want to be pushed into the nettles today, thank you. That's the clumsiest woman I've ever had in my service! None of you know how to look after me or take the slightest... Won't let me pay the butcher so I won't know where you keep your purse, but I do know, so put that in your needles and knit it. They say at the tallboys she's got enough inside of her purse, too. Well, nobody's seen it open. If you have a peep inside, you'll go down in history, that's what you'll do. - What ails her? - Ails her? She's an invalid, isn't she? If she's an invalid, I'm Mickey mouse. I must get back to my leg of pork. What are you doing in my garden? Come out of there! You're spoiling my pampas grass. Who gave you permission to come in here? Why, just wait. Did Mrs. Bramson call me, do you know? I'm sorry, miss. I don't know your name. Oh. Here. That's enough of that from you. There's not much doing around here for a girl, is there? It isn't a very entertaining quarter of the world for a young lady, is it? Danny, what did she say? Oh. Oh, I beg your pardon, miss. I'm not a snob, but in case you ever call here again, I'd like to point out that though I'm employed by my aunt, I'm not quite in Dora's position. Oh, I hope not. I am going to marry her, though. I don't believe you. You don't like me, do you? No. Everybody else does. Your eyes are set quite far apart, and your hands are quite good. I don't really know what's wrong with you. You know, I've been looking at you, too. You know, it's... I'm sorry. It's a waste of time doing your stuff with me. Are you playing up to Mrs. Bramson? Playing up? It just crossed my mind for a minute. You stand a very poor chance there, you know. What do you bet? They say they've got permits to look for that silly woman. Now, who are they? I should like to know. If there's anything I hate, it's these men who think they've got authority. But I don't think they're quite as bad as men who think they have, uh, charm. What did she mean by that? Well, there's no use thinking she has any, is there? Huh! Now, look here, young man, about Dora... Wait a minute. Wouldn't you be more comfortable with a pillow behind your back? I'll get one. No, no, no. Please don't. Please don't interfere. I don't like anybody touching my chair. That's better, isn't it? You're looking pale, too. Pale? Did you say pale? Washed out. I said to myself when I saw you for the first time... I said, "there is a lady who has a lot to contend with." Well, I have. Nobody knows that better than I do. I'm sure. Oh, it must be terrible to see everybody striding back and forth and enjoying everything and seeing them tasting the fruits... Oh, I shouldn't have said that. I am sorry. But it's true! As true as you're my witness, though nobody else ever seems to realize... Now, look here, young man, about Dora... Excuse me, ma'am. Is that your cat? Yes. I haven't seen him before. May I pick him up? Do you like cats? I like all animals, especially cats. Ah, he is a beauty. I'll bet he's a good companion to you, isn't he? About the only one in this house who is. I'm sure. Ah. Would you mind if I asked you what your ailments are? Well... Hadn't you better sit down? Thank you, ma'am. Well, I... I have the most terrible palpitations. Palpitations? And the way you get about. Oh? They're a very bad thing to have, you know. Do you realize that 9 women out of 10 in your condition would be lying down and giving way? - Would they? - Indeed, they would. I knew somebody once who had palpitations. It was somebody very near to me. - They're dead now. - Oh? My mother, as a matter of fact. Oh? I can just remember her. As a matter of fact... Yes? Oh, no. It's a daft thing. Come, come. Out with it. It's just my fancy, I suppose, but you remind me a bit of her. Of your mother? Oh? I don't like to talk about my mother. Makes me feel sort of sad. She had the same kind look as you have, the same eyes, very wide apart, and the same very good hands. And the same palpitations? And the same palpitations. You don't mind my talking about your health, do you? No. You know, you ought to get used to letting other people do things for you. Yes. You ought to be very careful. Yes. You're a strange sort of boy to be a pageboy. Am I? You seem so much too sensitive and understanding. Well, I've never had any advantages, but I've always tried to do the right thing. Well, I think you deserve better. Talking of the right thing, what about Dora? Oh, I'm going to marry her. You are? Sure. I'd marry her now, but with the job I've got, I can hardly keep myself. If I could get a job with a bit more money, I'd marry her like a shot. How would you like to work for me? - For you? - Would you like to? Indeed, I would. I can't imagine anything I'd like better than to live in a beautiful house like this with a kind lady, taking care of her. Well, well. We'll see. Have you got to go back? No, no, not just yet. It's my half-day. Stay to lunch. Well, I... - In the kitchen, of course. - Oh, yes, I know. There's plenty of food. Stay to lunch. That's very kind of you, I... Isn't there anything I could do to help a bit? Take you for a walk? For a ride in the sunshine? It's ever so nice out. Yes. Well... Well, all right. You know, I've taken a liking to you. That's very kind of you, Mrs. Bramson. It's the way you spoke about your mother. That's what it was. Was it? Yes. It was a very nice thought of yours. You could go out like this every day. And there's no one who would sooner wheel you than me. You're just saying things. Oh, indeed. You need a strong chap around that can take you for walks. Good morning. Morning, mum. What can I do for you? I want a shawl for an old lady, something nice, you know, to keep the draft out. Yes. I think I know. About what price? I don't want a very expensive one, but I want a nice one. Now, here's a very pretty shawl. This is an angora, and the price is 15 shillings. That's a little bit more than I ought to spend. I thought about five shillings? Here's a very pretty little shawl at five and six. This is a Shetland. Ah. That's nice. Would you mind putting it on so I could see how it looks? Certainly. Ah. Ah. That's nice. I'll take that one. Well, I think that's the lot, Mrs. Bramson. Mind you're not too easy with these people. If they haven't paid by Monday, you slap in a writ. And don't take any excuses. Very well. Now, if you'll sign the receipt for the money. I'll count it first. That's a great deal of money for you to keep loose in the house. There's 86 pounds there. Quiet. I'm trying to count. You've put me out. What did you say? Only said it's a lot of money for you to keep loose in the house. Keep more than that. "Put not your trust in banks" is my motto. Aren't you ever afraid of being robbed or burgled? No, I'm not. Wasn't there something in the paper about a woman having disappeared around here and foul play being suspected? A lot of nonsense. They put anything in the newspapers. All the same, I don't altogether like the idea of you and Olivia being here all by yourselves. That's very considerate of you, I must say. But you can put your mind at rest. There's a man coming to live here, so we shall be quite all right, thank you. A servant, you mean? Yes, a servant, so there's no need to be jealous. Jealous? Don't think I don't know it's Olivia you're thinking of and not me. That reminds me, there's something else I want to talk to you about. Olivia? Yes. How much have I left her? Left her? In my will. You've changed your will so often, I really can't say offhand. Well, I can... 200 pounds. I've been thinking it over, and I've come to the conclusion it's too much. I want to cut it in half. Mrs. Bramson! What's the matter? She hasn't any money of her own. Now, look here, Mr. Laurie. Are you going to take my instructions and do as you're told, or have I got to get another lawyer? Of course, if you insist. I do insist. Now, if you'll stop talking, I'll finish counting this money and you can get back to town. Oh, it's you. I've come to take up me residence. Is the old lady in? She's always in. Danny? Uh-huh? Did she say anything to you? Say anything? Yes, about us, you and me. Oh, she said she approved. She gave us her blessing. Well, then when? Soon, Dora. Soon. There. Now you can show me in. Well, I like that. Afternoon, mum. Oh, it's you, Danny. All ready to move in. - Have you brought your luggage? - Yes, mum. It's in the hall. Dora will show you your room. Right you are, mum. You might give me a hand. Is that the new servant? Yes. He's a very nice boy... very superior. Hello. Hello. I was afraid I was going to miss seeing you. Afternoon, miss. Just moving in. Good afternoon. Looks as if we're going on our holiday, doesn't it? Ha ha! Well, you all finished your business? Yes, I'm just going. Won't you walk to the car with me? I'd be glad to. Good-bye, Mrs. Bramson. Good-bye, and you do what I told you. Who's this chap that's moving in? He's a boy from the hotel she's taken a fancy to. The maid's young man. Seems a nice, friendly chap. Do you think so? Yes. Why? Don't you? No, no, I don't. I think he's common, insolent, conceited, and completely double-faced. I say, that's a bit strong, isn't it? What's he done to you? He hasn't done anything to me. You're on edge. That's what it is. Do you wonder? Living in that house with her? Has she been awful? Oh, no worse than usual, I expect. Darling, why do you put up with it? What else can I do? I have no money, and I... You know what else you can do. Uh-uh. Why not? Justin, really, not again. Yes, again and again and again! Olivia, why not? Why won't you marry me? Because... I told you before. I don't love you that way. I know, but even if you don't, wouldn't I be better than the old lady? I wouldn't bully you and treat you like a servant. You wouldn't have to live here in the middle of the woods, where nothing ever happens. But still, there's a chance that something might happen. What? Why, I don't know, but... Something. Oh, I know I'm a fool, Justin, and you're dear and sweet and good, but I... I just want to wait a little longer. I know you're going to tell me that storybook romance doesn't happen anymore. Oh, no, I won't. I know it does happen. It happened to me with you, only... Only what? Well, it isn't always dressed up quite as you imagine it. Why shouldn't Romeo wear tweeds and come along in a car instead of leaping over the balcony? I found my Juliet wearing glasses, sewing, and waiting hand and foot on an old lady. I recognized you almost immediately as the imprisoned Princess I had to rescue. Won't you let me rescue you? No, not yet, Justin. I'm sorry, but not yet. All right. I shan't give up hope. - Good-bye for the present, then. - Good-bye. Here's the Shepperly advertiser. Uh, is this your cap? Yes. I found it hanging in the hall. I think perhaps you'd better keep it in here. Can you imagine me doing a thing like that? Hanging it up just like I was a visitor. I am sorry. Are you all right in here? It used to be our box room. I think we've moved everything out. It's very nice. I hope I haven't put you to too much trouble. I've been hanging up a couple of pictures to make it seem more like home. Oh. Do you ever go to the movies? Sometimes. Real life's better, though. Oh, Napoleon. He did things. Was that your chap? What? Who? The fellow who was here just now. That was Mrs. Bramson's lawyer. What's she going to law about? He... he manages her affairs. Oh, I see. I thought from the way he looked at you he was a bit gone on you. It's rather stuffy in here. Why don't you open the window? Here, here. You know, you wouldn't be bad-looking without them glasses. Thank you, but it doesn't interest me very much what I look like. Don't you believe it. - Why do you say that? - I just think so. I understand you all right. Don't you think, young man, you're rather forgetting your place? I'm sorry, miss, I'm sure. When you've finished unpacking, perhaps you'd better come and see if there's anything you can do for Mrs. Bramson. Where have you been? Nowhere. Is there anything in the paper? A lot of sensational rubbish about that chalbrook woman. I can't read it. It's a bit of a thrill for a small place like this. Have they found any clues? "A keeper in the Shepperly woods reported "that on the night in question, about 2:00 in the morning, "he heard someone moving mysteriously in the woods "and whistling mighty Lak' a Rose. Inquiries are being pursued." That shows how hard up they are for something to print. Mighty Lak' a Rose, indeed! Never heard such rubbish in all me life. All settled and at home. - Can I be of service? - Silly boy. - What's that you're hiding? - It's nothing. - But what is it? - It's a silly idea. Come, come. What is it? It's just something I brought along that I thought you might like. It's a shawl. 'Twas my mother's, as a matter of fact. I thought I'd like to see you wear it, if you didn't mind. Danny, that's a very sweet thought. Can I put it on for you? Yes. I've always kept it. It's the only thing of my mother's I've got left. Now that I see you wearing it like that, it's almost as if herself were sitting there. Wait a minute. What is it? It's not quite straight. Straight? There. Wheel me over to the mirror. Let me see it. Right you are. There you are. How do you like yourself? That's very pretty. Thank you. You are a good boy. Now I think it's time for my nap. Shall I take you in? It's all right. I'll do it myself. Where do we go now? In there. This chair works very stiff. It must be very hard for you pushing yourself about in it. I could fix it in a jiffy if I had some oil. There's some in the kitchen. Good. Where do you want to go? Do you think you can help me onto the bed? Sure, I can. You be very careful of me. I'll treat you like you was made of glass. That's it. That's better, isn't it? Ahh, that's fine. Now, just while you're getting your spot of shuteye, I'll take that chair in the other room and have it right in half a minute. Thank you. Is that all right? Yes, it's very nice. It's very nice. Why, what are you looking at? I was looking at your room. I hadn't seen it before. Very pretty room. Yes, very pretty. That's a beautiful picture. Beautiful. Well, pleasant dreams and sweet repose. Half the bed and all the clothes. Silly boy. Good night. Silly boy. You agree with me now, don't you? You don't like my being here, do you? It doesn't make the least difference whether I like it or not. As I told you before, I'm really a servant here myself. Not a very ordinary servant, though, are you? No, I suppose not. Neither am I. Ha ha ha! Go on, Danny. Tell us some more. Well, that was when I rode the hounds and had me own pack. Before you went up in the world and become a pageboy, I suppose. You know how that happened? Danny told us about his uncle dying, leaving him a fortune. How much was it? 10,000 quid. It was 5,000 when I last heard it. And you got through it all in three months? Uh-huh. What did you spend it on? Champagne, jewels, a villa on the riviera. Then you went to sea? Sailed twice around the cape of good hope before the mast. I must take these... Madame Olga's dream book. "To dream of spiders means danger is approach..." Daft. I did dream of spiders last night... Hundreds of them. I should say danger was approaching, too, if you go on like that. Has he said any more about marrying you? Not since the day he moved in here. That's a whole week now. She hasn't brought it up again, either. Seems like it slipped their memory. Then you didn't ought to let him kiss you, not in front of me, anyway. I never let my husband kiss me in front of other people till after we was married. Then he didn't want to. Hark at that. He's turned the old place into a regular circus, that's what he's done. He'll have the old girl doing a rumba before we know where we are. Imagine my coming in here with my overalls on. I am sorry. It's all right. I got me trousers on. I'm sorry. Is my cigarette annoying you? Oh, not at all. I like it. Oh, I'm sorry, pussy. Here, come here, puss. Here, come to Danny. It won't come out. Oh, look. Right there! Over here. I saw that. Leave me alone and don't interfere. Here, here. Look. That... Oh... - And that... - Oh, yes. And that. Oh, yes, of course. Thank you, dear. Thank you. Ahem. - Cigarette bother you? - No, dear, not a bit. Of course not. I think it's coming out. Aha! Oh, Danny, you never forget. Very different from other people who never remember. Here. How do you like that for a steady hand? Oh, yes, Danny. A nice chocolate to take the taste out of your mouth. Ugh! Tastes nasty. The grocer said there were 2 gallons of kerosene delivered and not paid for. And they won't be paid for, either, not if I have to go to law about it. The amount of kerosene that man pretends we use here! You would think we drank it. I wish you'd take your papers into the other room. A... sonnet. "The flame of passion is not red, but white. Not quick, but slow..." Give me that, please. What is it? It's a poem. Let me see it. It's only nonsense, auntie. Really. I'm sure it is by the sound of it, but I can see it, can't I? Danny, give it to me. Writing poetry, indeed. That's a hobby and a half, I must say. What do you know about passion, anyway? Not very much. So I should think. I like a bit of poetry myself, I do, but I don't see how you think of those things, I really don't. She is a dark horse, isn't she? Writing poetry. Did you ever hear of such nonsense? Oh, I daresay she's a bit... A bit re... Repressed. Come on, now. It's time for your walk. Oh, Danny, dear. I've got your hat and your shawl in the hall. Have you got my pills and the chocolates? And the chocolates. Here you are, madam. Every wish anticipated. My hat's in the hall. Hat's in the hall. Yes. Well, is it cold out? - There you are. - And me shawl. And your shawl. You put it on. And my hat. Here we go. There. Isn't it beautiful? Look at the flowers growing like mad, the trees showing off like peacocks, and the birds singing their hearts out. Look at that. Mother and child, both doing well. What do you think of him? Danny? Oh, he's all right. Bit of a mystery. You think that, too? Terrible liar, of course, but then, a lot of us are. No more than that, eh? What do you mean? There's something more the matter with him, something he's hiding. What? I don't know for sure. Is Dora about? Oh, Dora! She won't know anything. She's as half-witted as she is lazy. She'd cut her nose off to stop the dustbin smelling sooner than empty it, she would. Did anyone say Dora? What do you know about Danny? His past, I mean. Only what he's told me, miss. It's ever so romantic. Oh, yes, I'm sure. - Do you trust him, Dora? - I don't quite know, miss. Sometimes I do, and sometimes I don't. Oh, he's all right. He cracks hisself up, pretends he don't care a tuppence, but all the time, he's got an eye on what you're thinking of him, if you know what I mean. Yes, yes, I do. That incredible vanity. They always have it, always. Who? Murderers. Miss Grayne. You mean this woman they're looking for? Oh, miss, you can't! Doesn't seem possible, does it? Yet murder's a thing that doesn't seem possible either. Just something you read about in the papers. Can't touch us, but it can. It's here, all about us, in that forest, in this house. We're living with it. We're... I'm going to look through his things. Will you help me? Me? All right. They're all empty. Perhaps he hasn't unpacked. But he's been here almost a week. Where does he keep his luggage? Oh, here we are. Open it up. See? He hasn't unpacked. That's extraordinary to begin with. Dirty shirt... A pair of socks, three handkerchiefs, and razor blades. Here's a pocketbook. Got a letter in it. Oh, we can't read his letters. Why not? Don't be silly. His wife will do it to him hundreds of times. Oh, what a niff! "Dear baby-face, my own." Signed "lil." What awful writing. "Next time you strike Newcastle, O.K. By me, baby." Ooh! Another servant girl, I expect. I'm sorry, Dora. O.K. Bus ticket. Some snapshots. Oh! Look at her! The impudence, being taken in a bathing suit! What's that group? Look, look! There she is. The woman who's missing. Don't you remember that photograph in the paper? It's awful to think she may be dead. Looks ever so... Mmm, don't she? There was another bag, wasn't there? Yes. This. And this. Old-fashioned, isn't it? Got it from the box room at the tallboys, I should think. Too heavy for a hat. Looks extraordinary, doesn't it? What is it, miss? I was just thinking... Supposing there's something inside of it. I left the old lady's pills in the pocket of my other coat. Silly of me, wasn't it? May I have it back, please? It's the only one I've got. How did you like the letter? Letter? You've got it in your hand. Means well, lil does. But we had a row. She would spy on me. If there's anything I hate, it's a spy. Don't you agree? I'd sooner have anything than a spy. Bar a murderer, of course. What did you say? I said, bar a murderer, of course. Talking of murder, do you know anything of Mrs. Chalbrook's whereabouts at the present moment? Mrs. Who? You're not going to pretend you've never even heard of her? Oh, Mrs. Chalbrook's whereabouts! I thought you said Mrs. Chalbrookswear. I am sorry. It was silly of me. I couldn't think. I... Well? I have nothing to go on, but I think she's been murdered. Oh. Who by? Danny! Danny! Ha ha! The old lady's getting impatient. Excuse me. Miss, you can't think that! I'd sooner suspect me unborn child. You don't really think he did it, do you? Do you? I don't know. So I closed the door very quickly and I said, "I am sorry, sir," so that she wouldn't think that I knew there was a woman in there. Oh, Danny, you'll be the death of me. The things you say! I think it's time I went in and had my 40 winks. 40 winks, ma'am, or 50 if you like. You oughtn't make me laugh. There's always my heart. You've lost your heart to the little fellow who pushes your pram. Pram! Stop that noise. I want to go to sleep. Did you do it? I told you you'd be better-looking without them glasses. I don't know what you mean. Don't you? Aah! Clumsy. I am sorry. You're very conceited, aren't you? Yes. You're acting all the time, too, aren't you? Acting? Acting what? Look how I can look you in the eye. I can stare you down. I have a theory it's the criminals who can look you in the eye. The honest ones blush and look away. Oh? It's a very blank look, though, isn't it? Is it? You are acting all the time, aren't you? Yes! What are you like when you stop acting? I don't know, it's so long since I stopped. - But when you're alone... - Then I act more than ever. Why? I don't know. Because I like it. I... Just for a change, suppose you let me ask you a question or two. Just for a change. Why can't you take a bit of interest in some other body but me? But I'm not interested in you, only you don't talk. That's bound to make people wonder. Wonder what? What you're thinking. Ha ha! You'd be surprised. I wonder if I would. I think I can diagnose you all right. Carry on. You haven't any feelings at all. You live in a world of your own, of your own imagination. I don't know whether I understand you very well, not being so very literary. You understand me perfectly. Do you still think there's been a bit of dirty work? Oh, I don't know. Disappointed? What on earth do you mean? Why should I be disappointed? A bit of excitement in a place like this where nothing ever happens, wouldn't it? Well, if there has been a murder, it won't go undiscovered long. What makes you say that? They never do. They always make one mistake. Ha ha! That's what you think. What about those you don't know about? What about the ones who do it and get away with it? Those are the clever ones... Fool the police and everybody. You take this woman. She's been missing now for two weeks, hasn't she? They haven't found her yet, have they? What was that? It's Dora. She's fainted! I think... I think they've found something! Excuse me. Might I use your telephone? It's urgent! Certainly. It's right here. Thank you, miss. Shepperly 13. What is it? What's happened? I'd rather not say till I've got through, if you don't mind. Shepperly police station. Who's that? This is Fred Gaston. We've found her. Yes. Right across from Rose briars. Well... well, not all of it. Well, sir, the head's missing. Right you are, sir. Thank you. Sorry to have troubled you. Did you hear that? Where are you going? Going to have a look. Coming? I want keystone 2348. Yes, please. What have you found over there? Have a look. What's going on? Hello? Is Justin Laurie there, please? Oh, is that you, Mrs. Laurie? This is Olivia Grayne. Yes. Is Justin in, please? Oh... do you know where he is? I see. No. Thank you very much. It's all right. It's quite all right. Thank you. - What are you doing here? - I've got to see you, talk to you. Is anything the matter? You look so strange. Where's your hat? Can't we go somewhere, somewhere we can talk? Yes. Come over here. Hard luck, Laurie. Good show. Olivia, what is it? Darling, tell me. My dear, your hands are like ice! - Justin, they've found her. - Found whom? The missing woman. She's been murdered. They found the body in the woods near our house. Olivia! That's not all. There's more to it than that. Her... But who? I don't know. I don't know. I just came running here to you. My poor darling. How horrible for you. - Have they no idea? - I don't think so. None. You can't go back there. Oh, no. No, I can't. They're drawing stumps in half an hour. I'll take you to town, to mother's. You can stay with us. Oh, may I? Of course you may, as long as you like. Forever, if you want to. Oh, Justin, you're very good to me. I'm only sorry it's a thing like this that gives me a chance to be. I do love you so, Olivia. You know, I've never seen you without your glasses before. You're very beautiful. Suppose I give mother a call and tell her to expect you? No. No, don't. Why not? I can't come. I must go back. But why? Well, I... I can't leave Mrs. Bramson there alone. She's got what's-his-name, that boy, hasn't she? He's all right, isn't he? Oh, yes, he's all right. He... well, I mean, running away like this, they might think I did it. You? Olivia, darling, don't be ridiculous. It couldn't have been anyone in your house. No, that's right. It couldn't have been could it? There's something more behind all this. What is it? Oh, no. It's nothing, really. I shouldn't have come running off to you like this. I lost my head, that's all. I'll be all right now. Take no notice of me. Tell me all about the match. That was a good boundary you hit. How many was that? - Six. - Oh... that's fine. That's fine. Move over there while I get this picture. Now, young man, you came over here the day after I saw you at the tallboys. Is that right? That's right, sir. You never told me you were thinking of making a change. I didn't know it myself, sir. That was the first day I called here, and Mrs. Bramson asked me to come and work for her. - Did you know him before? - No. Take up any references? I didn't need any references. I talked to him. That's enough for me. What are you trying to suggest? Oh, nothing, nothing... Only it seems an odd coincidence... Nothing odd about it. The boy came to see my maid. They're going to be married. Oh. First I've heard of that. That's good news, anyhow. Oh, it's awful. Awful! Asking all those questions. I'm not going to stay here anymore. If you run away now, they'll think you did it. I never thought of that. They'd set the bloodhounds on you, that's what they'd do. Oh, dear! I never thought I'd get mixed up with anything like this. This is a lot nicer place for me than the hotel, what with Dora being here and Mrs. Bramson being like a mother to me. Yes, yes, I see. All right, then. At least you didn't make any mystery about your movements. Oh, there you are. Where have you been all the afternoon? Good afternoon, miss Grayne. We were wondering what had happened to you. We was getting quite worried, we was. - Where have you been? - Nowhere. I'll have to ask you the same question, miss Grayne. I'm sorry, inspector, but I... I've been to see a friend of mine. You know what's been happening around here, don't you? Yes, I do. You were here when it happened, so Danny tells me. Then you rushed out to see a friend of yours. It's true, inspector. I was here when it happened, but I... I lost my head. I couldn't stay here. I just ran. Who is this friend of yours? Uh, Mr. Laurie. Mrs. Bramson's lawyer. Oh, a lawyer. Yes, but I didn't go to see him as a lawyer. He's a friend of mine, the only friend I've got, so I went to see him because I was frightened. I... I didn't intend to come back here anymore. He persuaded you to? No. He told me not to. Well, then, why did you come back? I realized that I was being foolish and hysterical, that I shouldn't leave Mrs. Bramson alone, because that would look as though I... I don't know. I was just silly to be frightened, that's all, so I came back. Hmph! A likely story. But it's true, inspector. You've got to believe that. It is true. Yes, I believe you. I know it doesn't sound very sensible, but fear makes people do silly things sometimes. I think that will be all for the present. I'm sorry to have put you through all this, but I'm afraid it's only the beginning. I can stand it. Good. Well, I'll be round again. Don't you worry, Mrs. Bramson. We'll get him. You've been missing a lot of excitement... Journalists and photographers. Mrs. Bramson's had her picture taken three times. I want you to get all the papers in the morning, and it wouldn't be a bad idea to get a book to stick them in. What are you staring at me like that for? I honestly believe you're enjoying it. How could you? Oh! Oh, it's you. What do you want? - What do you want? - I heard a noise. What are you doing? Making some tea. I couldn't sleep. I'm just waiting for the kettle. Cigarette? Thank you. What did you tell that chap this afternoon? That they'd found that woman. Is that all? Yes... of course that's all. What else was there to tell? Nothing... Nothing. So you just told him that, and then you come back. Why? - What do you mean, why? - Why did you come back? I told you. I realized I was being silly to be frightened, and I thought... - Why do you shake your head? - That isn't why you come back. Do you like that chap? What do you mean? Of course I like him. Why aren't you married, then? I don't know what right you have to ask me... Don't be angry. I only asked you a civil question. Why aren't you married? Hasn't he asked you yet? Oh, yes. Yes, he has asked me, but... There you are. You see? You don't like him. And you're right, you know. He's not the sort of a chap for you. You want adventure, don't you? And it's here... Here in this house, here now in this kitchen... The two of us alone here at this time of night. It's exciting, isn't it? Something that's never happened to you before, being alone at this time of night with a chap like me. You're not frightened. You're excited. I can tell you are. Your eyes are shining, you've got color in your cheeks, and you're beautiful... The way he's never seen you. Don't... Don't! I'm frightened of you! And you feel as light as air, the same as anybody out for the first time without their overcoat. You haven't had a drink, but you feel as if you have. You never knew there was such a secret part inside of you. That's why you come back this afternoon... Wasn't it? Wasn't it? Danny. Danny. Ha! Now, ladies and gentlemen, I want you first of all to note the beauty, the calm, the solitude of these surroundings and then realize that immediately in front of us lies the spot where this grisly spectacle was uncovered not 100 yards from the Rose-clad, unsuspecting, peaceful residence behind us. Not for one moment did Mrs. Bramson think... Mrs. Bramson is the proprietress of the residence... - Are you talking about me? - Oh, good morning, ma'am. I've brought another party. Remarkable, isn't it, the interest shown in this lugubrious occurrence? This, ladies and gentlemen, is Mrs. Bramson, of whom I was telling you. How do you do? Pleased to meet you, ma'am. Nasty thing to have turn up almost on your own doorstep, ain't it? Would you mind if I was to take a picture of you? Oh, not at all! Is my hat on straight? Oh, and this young gentleman, now employed by Mrs. Bramson as personal attendant and bodyguard, was formerly a pageboy at the tallboys hotel at the very moment the unfortunate victim of this outrage disappeared. Shh! Now, ladies and gentlemen... Will you give me your autograph? If you will draw a little closer, you will perceive the exact spot where the body was uncovered. Ladies and gentlemen, the exact spot. Here, who you shoving? A little orderliness is what we want. They say it was horrible how they found her. The moment I heard she was missing, I said, "search the forest. She's been murdered." That's what I said. You could have knocked me down with a feather. Grisly... that's what it was. There's only one word for it... grisly. I told my poor old mother all about it when I got home at night, and that's what she said. "How grisly, Emaline. How grisly." Good-bye. - Good-bye! - Good-bye! Dear, oh, dear, oh, dear. I feel dead. Don't be a silly old woman. You don't look a day over 40. After I've made you a nice cup of tea, you'll be 25 in the sun and 18 with your back to the light. So consider yourself lucky. Danny, you are a terror! Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear. What an afternoon. I noticed a slight falling-off in attendance today. Sunday, I guess. Danny, you mustn't talk like that. Oh, dear, oh, dear. There you are. Will you take my hat, dear? Right you are, mum. And my cape. Don't you call me mum! If I can't call you mum, what can I call you? If you're very good, I might let you call me... Mother. O.K., mother o' mine! Ha ha ha! Oh, Danny, you are a terror! He's been acting like this all the afternoon. - Has he? - I'll go make some tea. Mrs. Terence will get it. Mrs. Terence is entertaining visitors at the scene of the crime. Besides, Mrs. Terence can't make tea the way I can. I'm an old sailor. I'm afraid I'm not much interested. I'll go and see if she's put the kettle on. Now look here, you're downright rude to that boy. What have you got against him? His manner. His familiarity. His manner's a great deal more cheerful than yours is! He's been in rare spirits all the afternoon. Whiskey, if my sense of smell doesn't deceive me. Whiskey? That's a libel! The boy's a teetotaler. Auntie, how do you know that? He told me so. And of course you believe everything he tells you. You're jealous of him, my girl, that's what you are. I know human nature. I know that boy's got a beautiful character. Look at the way the cat's taken to him. Animals and young children know about people. Here you are... a nice cup of tea with two lumps and some of the little cakes you like. Thank you, dear. Danny... let me smell your breath. Clean as a whistle. Smells of peppermint. Oh. There's some in the kitchen. "The murderer committed the crime in the forest, "probably under cover of night. "The body was nude. Attempts had been made to... To..." "Turn to foot of next column." "Attempts had been made "to era-eradicate fingerprints with a knife, "possibly a butcher's knife, which was..." What's the matter? I forgot it was sunday. They're going to church down in the villages, all got up in their sunday best, and the organ is playing, and the windows are shining... Shining on holy things, because holy things isn't afraid of the daylight. Why, Danny, what... But all the time, the daylight's moving across the floor. By the end of the sermon, the air in the church is turning gray, and the people isn't able to think of holy things so much anymore, but only of the terrible things that's going on outside, because they know it's still daylight. Everything is ordinary and quiet, and today is the same as all the other days, and it'll come to an end... And it'll be night. Why, Danny! You ought to have been a preacher. Ha ha ha! I think I'll go and have my nap before supper. Olivia, take this. Will you wheel me in? Anything you say, mother o' mine. Anything you say. I never knew you had so many words in you. I speechify like anything when I'm roused. I used to go to sunday school, and words popped into my head. Here now, put your arms around little Danny. There you are. Now, what am I going to do with this bundle of rubbish? There you are. Lie down now. There. Your feet up, and I'll get your pillow. Thank you. I'll undo your bib and Tucker. Thank you, Danny. My, you are thoughtful, Danny. What is that you wear around your neck... a locket? It's a key. The key to your heart? I ought to have that. Don't be silly. It's the safe key. I always wear it around my neck. You're quite right. You never know. Here, let me take your shoes off. There's one, and there's two. Now this little pig went to market... Don't be silly! This pig had roast beef. This little pig had none. This pig went "wee wee wee" all the way home! You'll be the death of me. We'll cover you all up. Now, quiet. You want to sleep. Quiet. That's fine. No noise. Ah, that's enough. Good night. Good night. Can I have a read of that? If you like. It's interesting, all this, isn't it? You have been drinking, haven't you? You don't miss much, do you? No. I've had a drink... And I feel fine. Do you want me to read to you? I'd rather talk. Carry on. I'd rather ask you a few questions. Carry on. Are you sure you were ever a sailor? Are you sure you weren't a butcher? Aw, talking's daft. Doing's the thing. You can talk, too. Yes, I can. Did you hear me just now? She's right, you know. I should have been a preacher. I can remember when I was a kid sitting in sunday school with my mother alongside of me, and her pointing at the pulpit and then at me as if to say, "that's the place for you." I never forgot that. And I don't believe a word of it. Neither do I, but it sounds wonderful, doesn't it? I can't remember my mother, and I never had a father. And the first thing I remember is the docks. And you're the first woman I ever told that to, so you can compliment yourself... Or the drink. I think it's the drink. You do live in your own imagination, don't you? Yes. It's the only way to bear with the awful things you have to do. What awful things? Well... I haven't had as much to drink as that. This is no sort of a life for you. What is there to it? Tell me that. What is there to it? Getting up every morning at 7:00, washing my stockings, mending them, having breakfast with a bad-tempered old woman, spending the rest of the day in this dreary house with her, going to bed every night at 10:30... - Don't you like the old lady? - I could kill her. No, you couldn't. Not many people has it in them to kill people. Oh, no. Tell me about your life at the tallboys. My life? Well, the day didn't start off so good, with a lot of stuck-up boots to clean and a lot of dirty spoons to Polish that had been in the mouths of gaping fools that looks through me as though I was a dirty window. Orders, orders, orders. Go here, go there, do this, do that, page. Page! I'm not a page, I'm a millionaire! Everybody's under me. Just when I think I've got a bit of peace, there's somebody nagging, nagging, at me... Calls me everything and screams and screams till nothing will shut that mouth, only... Go on. Ha ha ha! I'm too smart for you. You'd like to know, wouldn't you? Why would you like to know? Why are you so interested? I told you there the other night in that kitchen, didn't I? Why were you lying awake that night? You were awake, too. Tell me why. You can't sleep, can you? You can't sleep! There's something in the back of your mind that keeps you awake... Something you've pushed into the back of your mind that you can't do anything about and never will. It's a little thing, isn't it? It's a box. Only a box! And it's rather heavy. The way you was going through my letters the other day... I had to laugh. It's the only thing that keeps me awake. I don't know what to do. Nothing in the world worries me. Nothing worries me! Only I can't stand a pair of eyes staring at me with no look in them. And I don't know what to do! I don't know what to do! I live by myself. See? Inside here, and all the rest of you can go hang... After I've made use of you, though. Nothing's going to stop me, nothing! It's all right... It's all right. Anybody that's there, I'll deal with them. You watch me. Hello, Dan. How's things? - How are you, sir? - Good afternoon, miss Grayne. Good afternoon. We haven't scared you all out of the house yet, I see. Not a chance, sir. No more news for me, I suppose? I'm afraid not. Too bad, too bad. How's the old girl bearing up? It's been a bit of a shock for her, finding the remains of the lady almost in her garden, as you might say. Remains of the lady? I wish you wouldn't talk like that. I've seen them. Well, you see, sir, I haven't. No, thank you. Dan, I don't mind telling you that they reckon the fellow who did this job was a pretty clever chap. - You don't say so. - Yes. Regular film star. Got in all the papers, made his name. If you can make your name without anybody knowing what it is, of course. Yes, of course. But any really clever murderer would have taken the trouble to make sure that the body couldn't be recognized. Here we come and identify it first go. Do you call that clever? What do you think? Well, sir, I'm... I'm a slow thinker, but if it was clever to leave the lady un... un... Unidentified. Thank you. To leave the lady unidentified and not be caught, hasn't it been more clever to leave the lady identified and still not be caught? Why didn't you sleep in your bed on the night of the 10th? What's that, sir? Why didn't you sleep in your bed on the night of the murder? - I did, sir. - No, you didn't. Oh, yes, that's right. Except for about half an hour. I couldn't sleep for toffee, and I went up the fire escape onto the roof. What time was that? I don't know. You know how it is. You wake up in the middle of the night, you don't know what time it is. I couldn't sleep when I was at sea, either. Why didn't you tell us about your relations with the deceased woman? What's that, sir? Now come along, old chap. You know you were seen by two of the maids talking to her in the shrubbery. Well? Oh, sir, it's been on my conscience ever since. Oh, then you and she were... No! Nothing like that. I avoided her ever after the first day she stopped me, but you know how it is... A lady staying at the hotel where I was working and for all I knew, married... You're only human, aren't you? When you asked me all about her at the hotel, I was frightened to tell about her stopping me. Now that I've told you, it's a weight off my mind you wouldn't believe. You see, it was the disgust of almost getting mixed up with her that was keeping me awake nights. I see. Ha! You're a bit of a milksop, aren't you? Am I, sir? Yes. That will be all. I'll let you off this time. I'm that relieved. Don't try and keep anything from the police another time. I won't, sir. Oh, by the way, there's just one thing... Just a matter of form. But if you don't mind, I'll just have a quick look through your things. Just a matter of form, that's all. Yes, sir. Well, where do you hang out? In there. First door on the left. You can't miss it. All right. I'll find it. You can't miss it. This box is locked. Have you got the key? It isn't mine. Not yours? - No, sir. - Whose is it, then? I don't know. It isn't mine. I'm so sorry. I thought that you'd... Inspector... What are you doing with my box? Your box? Yes. It has all my letters in it. But I found it in Dan's room. That used to be the box room. Oh, I see. I think I'll keep it in my wardrobe. It'll be safer there. I'm very sorry, miss, I'm sure. I, uh... I hope I haven't offended the young lady. She'll be all right, sir. Well, young fellow, I must be off. You might tell Mrs. Bramson I popped in. I will, sir. Tell her I hope she'll soon be better. I will. Thank you. - Good day. - Good day, sir. Good... Danny. Danny, take this. That's better. Makes you feel fine. It's a silly thing to do. Proper girl's trick, fainting like that. Do something. I've got to do something. First thing I do, I'll relieve you of that hatbox, if you don't mind. Do you mind if I go in there? I don't know what's the matter with you. You haven't eaten anything, either of you. Well, I'm sorry, auntie. I'm not hungry. Neither am I. Must be them peppermints I ate before dinner. Sort of took my appetite away. They didn't take your tongue away, did they? You haven't uttered a word ever since we've sat down at table. I am sorry. I have a sort of a headache. Headache? Rubbish. At your age? It's imagination. What are we doing sitting here in the half-light? It's enough to give anyone the fidgets. Turn up the lamp. And draw the curtains! No, no, don't. Why not? I don't know why not. It just brings the night nearer, that's all. I don't know what on earth you mean. Draw the curtains, Danny. Auntie, will you excuse me? I want to go to my room. What for? I can't sit here any longer. - You haven't had your pudding yet. - I don't care for any, thank you. You can sit and watch us have it, then. I'm sorry. I just can't sit here any longer. Oh, it's getting quite chilly. Get me the little shawl from my room, dear, will you? The shawl, dear. I'm sorry, mum. In the land of nod I was. - What was it your highness wanted? - The shawl. A shawl. No sooner said than done. Watch me. 1, 2, 3. Ha ha! Silly boy. Silly boy. Where are you off to? I want keystone 2348. Who are you telephoning? Who are you telephoning? Olivia! Answer me! Hello. Is Mr. Justin Laurie there? Oh, ho. So that's what it is. Hello, Justin. Yes. I've changed my mind. I'm coming up to town. Will your mother put me up? My dear, of course. What's the matter? Has anything happened? Yes, but I can't tell you about it now. I'm coming right up. I'll be there in an hour. Good-bye, Justin. Olivia, what is the meaning of this? Listen to me. I thought I was frightened the other day. Today, when I saw the light beginning to fail and night coming nearer and nearer, I felt my fingertips getting cold, and I knew for the first time what real terror was. I'm not a fool, and I'm not hysterical, but I can't tell anymore what are real things and what aren't. The day's over, and the forest is all about us. Anything can happen. You shouldn't stay in this house tonight, either. That's very silly of you, trying to scare an old woman with a weak heart. What have you got to be frightened of? There's been a murder, you know. The murderer is still about. Well, nobody's going to murder you. Besides, we've got Danny to look after us. He's as strong as an ox. No silly nerves about him. - Where is he? - He's getting my shawl. He's been a long time. Danny! Coming, mum, coming! How are you going to get to town? Not too frightened to walk through the forest? I'd rather spend the night in the forest than in this house. That sounds very convincing, I must say. Well, you can go, but I give you fair warning. When you come back, I'm not so sure that I shall answer the door. Think that over in the morning. The morning? Who was that at the door? My niece... gone for the night, if you please. Gone? For the night? Would you believe it? Says she's frightened. Come along with that shawl, dear. I'm freezing. I don't know what's up with me tonight. Better have a chocolate. Come on. You don't catch me staying here after dark these days. Dear, wait for me. Oh, I'll be back. Well, I'm on me way rejoicing. Everybody seems to be going. What's the matter with you all? What will you have for lunch tomorrow? Lunch tomorrow? Let me see. How about a nice little steak with some baked potatoes? And some of that nice roly-poly pudding with jam on it, the way you like it? Yes, I think so. Yes. I see... something light. O.K. Good night, mum. This wood is damp. Better get some kerosene. Danny, do you think Olivia is a thief? I shouldn't be a bit surprised. What? Well, her eyes isn't very wide apart. My goodness! My jewelry case! What a fool I was to let her go! And my purse is on the table. If she's taken anything, I'll have the police after her. I don't care if she's my niece or whether she isn't. I always hated her mother, and as for her father, he was a... Aah! Oh, it's you. The slightest thing makes me jump these days. Are you going now? Yes. You couldn't bribe us to stay. It will be pitch-dark in half an hour. I'm not going to ride through the forest like that. Why, the murderer may be lurking. I'll go with you, only the other way. You going out? Yes. I feel funny. I have all evening. You can't leave her here by herself. She'll scream the place down. I asked her this very minute, and she said she wouldn't mind. Says it will do me good. She won't hear of me staying. - There's no good arguing with her. - You're telling me. You have a nice, long walk while you get the chance. You wait on her too much. - Good night. - Well, good night! Good night, Dora! See you in the morning! There's nothing missing. The cupboard lock's broken. There are marks all around. Talking to myself. Where's that boy... Oh, getting kerosene, I suppose. Wish people wouldn't walk off like that, leave me high and dry. Where are my chocolates? Oh, there they are. What was that? Danny? Danny! Oh, it was nothing. Silly. Oh, the clock. Danny? What's that boy doing in that kitchen? I've got the jitters. I've got the jitters. I've got the jitters, Danny! Danny? Danny? He's gone. They've all gone! They've left me here alone! Oh! Oh! Heaven help a poor old woman! Oh, ho ho! Danny. Danny! Danny! Danny! Danny! Danny! Danny! There's something outside. What shall I do? What shall I do? Danny! Danny! Danny! Danny! Where are you? Where are you, Danny? Danny, there's something outside! Oh! Oh! Heaven help me. Forgive us our trespasses as we have forgiven... Danny! Oh, oh, oh! It's all right. It's all right. It's Danny. It's all right. No, no, no. It's all right. It's all right. No, it's all right. Please, please. I'll never forgive you, Danny! Never, never! Shh. Shh. It's all right. Shh. All right. Now wait a minute. I've got... Here you are. Here you are. I don't want it! I don't want any! Take a little bit. That's fine. Make you feel better. There. I am so sorry. Dora and Mrs. Terence wanted me to take them down the main road because they was frightened. That's better, isn't it? There, there. I don't know yet. Give me some more. Yes, here you are. There. All alone I was, alone in the world... Just an old woman crying for help, and no answer. Oh, poor old mum, crying for Danny. There. That's better. There... Oh, Danny! Oh, Danny! The relief when I saw your face... Ha ha! I'll bet you wasn't half-glad. You're the only one that understands me, that's what you are. I don't have to tell you all I've been through. I don't have to tell you about my husband, how unkind he was. Ah, yes. I know. You know. You just know. I know, mum. There. That's better. That's better. Oh, Danny! Oh, Danny! Danny, dear, you remember that time you spoke to me about my reminding you of your mother? I remember. They can say what they like, but that was a beautiful thought. When I think you're just an ignorant boy, it's... it's startling. I shall never forget it... Not as long as ever I live. Ah, there, now. That's better, isn't it? That's better. Ahh! Ah, I want a chocolate now. A chocolate, a chocolate. Here you are. One of the little ones with the violets on top here. Here you are. No, no, no! Open your mouth, close your eyes, and see what the queen's got for you. Silly boy. Ah... There. That's better. No one else understands me, Danny. You're the only one that understands me, Danny. What are you doing? Just playing, just playing. Silly. Great, strong hands, they are. You're a pet, my little chubby-face, my little baby-face, my little Danny. Am I in a draft? Just a minute. Just a minute. I've... got to take care of myself, haven't I? You have, you have. I'd like to get into my chair now, please. I'll get your chair. I'll get your chair. There you are. Easy does it. Easy does it. That's fine. There you are. Time for bye-byes. Time for bed with you. You're a sleepy girl tonight. Sandman's coming for you. Sandman's coming for you. ♪ Rockaby, baby, in the treetop ♪ ♪ When the wind blows ♪ ♪ The cradle will rock ♪ ♪ When the bough breaks ♪ Shh. ♪ The cradle will fall ♪ ♪ And down will come baby ♪ ♪ Cradle and all ♪ ♪ Rockaby, baby ♪ ♪ In the treetop ♪ ♪ When the wind blows ♪ ♪ The cradle will rock ♪ ♪ When the bough breaks ♪ ♪ The cradle will fall ♪ ♪ And down will come... ♪ ♪ Baby, cradle and all ♪ ♪ Rockaby, baby, in the treetop ♪ What a funny look on your face, dear, smiling like that. You look so kind... Sokind. What are you going to do with that? Aah! Aah! You've killed her. You've killed her! I've never seen a dead body before. You killed her... Didn't you? Didn't you? Well, why don't you say something? Why did you come back? To find you out. No, that isn't why you come back. That isn't why you come back the other day, either. It was. It was. I had to find you out. Now I have. You come back here to be alone with me... The same as you was there in the kitchen the other night. Didn't you? Didn't you? Yes, I did. I thought I wanted to. I never knew before what murder was like. I thought there was something... Something about you that I... Even after that, when I saw you were frightened, I was sorry for you. I must have been out of my head. You're loathsome. Loathsome. You sit there looking happy. Why not? Look. Why, this is my chance... My big chance. You're the one I can tell about myself. They'll catch you. They'll find you out. Oh, no, they won't. There's one big difference between me and other fellas that tries this game. I'll never be found out because I don't care that. You don't know me, do you? I'm sick and tired of hearing how clever everybody else is. I want to tell them how clever I am for a change. Money I'm going to have and people doing what they're told and me telling them to do it. There was a woman at the tallboys, wasn't there? And she wouldn't be told, would she? And that old lady treating me like a son and a servant at the same time! She's been more use to me tonight than she's ever been to any other body as long as she's lived. The world's going to hear from me! You wait. But you can't wait, can you? What do you mean? When I say I'll never be found out, I mean that no living soul will ever be able to tell any other living soul about me. Can you think of anybody who might go tomorrow and tell the police? I can. No, you can't. Why can't I? I'm up against a very serious problem, but the answer to it is simple as pie to a fella like me, simple as pie. There's no use looking at that telephone. The wire's been cut. The old lady isn't going to be found tomorrow morning, and maybe she won't be the only one missing. Perhaps the house will be gone, too. The house and both of you, gone. Gone! Aren't you frightened? Don't you think I'll do it? Yes. Yes, I know you will, but I'm not frightened. I don't know why, but I'm not. I suppose it's because I'm seeing you for the first time and realizing what an escape I've had. Escape? You can kill me. I daresay you would have, anyway, but at least now I know what you are. I know what you're like! You're mad. You're mad and horrible! And to think that I was... Oh, I'm glad I came back. I'm glad. I made up my mind about you just now, when I was telling you about myself. That's the kind of a fella I am. I make up my mind about something, and then I do it. Remember the first day I come here? I said to myself when I first saw you, "there's a young lady who's got her wits about her. "There's a girl who knows a thing or two. "She's not like the others. She's got..." What's that light? There's somebody out there holding a flashlight! Somebody's watching! They've got no call to watch! I'm the one that watches! I'll tell them. I'm the one that watches! Eyes! Eyes! Hundreds of eyes back of each tree! Thousands of eyes! What's that? Like the sound of a big wall falling over into the sea. Everything's slipping out from under me! Can't you feel it? Starting in slow and then hundreds of miles an hour! There's a wind in my ears, a terrible, rushing wind! Everything's going past me like telegraph Poles! Everything going backwards! Everything I've ever seen... Faster and faster back to the day I was born! I can see it coming... The day I was born! I'm going to die. Good evening, miss Grayne. Hello, Dan. Hello, sir. - Second time today, eh? - That's right, sir. What's going on here? We're having a talk before bed. How's the old lady? Fine, sir. She's gone to bed. Gone to bed? She didn't want to be disturbed. Smell of kerosene. Inspector, it's in there. You know how she is. She's a bit nervy these days, sir. I hadn't got round the corner before she began calling me. "Danny! Danny! Danny!" She screamed. Danny... that's a pet name for Dan she has. I told her it was dangerous keeping that much kerosene in the house! I told her it was... Sorry to bring you back at this time of night, sir. That's all right. It's no trouble. Let's have a look at your hands, old chap, will you? Ugh! Agh! That's better. You better come along quietly. I'll leave these two men in charge. They'll see that nothing's disturbed. This is the real thing, my boy. Acting... That's what she said, wasn't it? Well, she was right, you know. I've been playing up to you. I showed you a thing or two, didn't I? This is the real thing. Have you got a cigarette? Tastes funny. I want something now I've never wanted before in my whole life... A long walk... All by myself. It's contrary, isn't it? Come on. Well, I'll hang in the end, but they'll get their money's worth at the trial. You wait. Justin, how did... I tried to get you on the phone again. There was no answer. I was afraid something was wrong, so I called the shepperly police station. You don't say thank you to someone who saved your life, do you? Besides, it's more than my life you saved tonight. It's my reason. My darling.
