Mosfilm Film Studio 3 Ordinary fascism The documentary uses trophy documentary footage from the Film Archive of the German Ministry of Propaganda and the personal photo archive of Adolf Hitler, and also a variety of amateur photos taken by Nazi officials and soldiers. Ordinary Fascism In our documentary, we certainly do not intend to cover all aspects of such a complex phenomenon as fascism. This is simply impossible within the constraints of a single documentary. It is also impossible because many important aspects of fascism were never filmed, thus leaving no documentary evidence. From a vast amount of materials, we simply selected those that impressed us the most and those that, in our opinion, allow us together with our audience to ponder over this phenomenon. Chapter One A merry cat. A hungry cat. A sly cat. A bear. An unhappy lion in the zoo. Right from their first word and their first step, children feel the need for creative expression. And how different these children are. They contemplate the world and try to express it any way they can. A construction site. The first snow. A stadium. The 20th century. The 21 st century. These people do not realize that we are filming them... ...and, to a certain degree, we feel sorry for this. We came to one of Moscow's universities during the entrance exams, set up our camera in the yard and tried to observe, without being noticed, how people await the results of the exams, how differently they behaved and expressed their innermost feelings. Well, it is common knowledge that one has to wear one's oldest pair of shoes during the exams... ...and, of course, having a haircut on the eve of the exam bodes certain failure. And here is the announcement of the results. How amazingly diverse human beings are. And someone is waiting for these people. I think someone is. Although the waiting can be different, as well. Probably, only love can make people resemble each other in some way. This is Moscow. And here is Warsaw. There are many people down below, and all of them have their own personal perception of the surrounding world, and every one is a human being. For every mother, her child is the best in the world. For every child, his mother is the best, the most beautiful and unique. "My mother is the most beautiful woman" is the title of this series of children's drawings. My mother is a ballet dancer. And my mother is a singer. For this kid from Berlin, his Mom is the most beautiful woman, whereas for this kid from Moscow, his Mom is the best. "Deutchland uber alles" is written on this post. Germany is more important than anything. Germany is above all. Today, new museums replace former concentration camps in Europe. Wooden barracks have long been burnt down; only ruined chimneys jut out from the grass. Skeletons of brick buildings are overgrown with weeds and wild flowers. We can enter this building. The smell of human bodies has been gone for decades. Thousands died here. And now the visitors leave their inscriptions on the walls, as they do everywhere. These freshly painted furnaces cooled off a long time ago, and the bathtub built for the commandant of the crematorium right next to them is now useless. Tons of women's hair lie behind a special protective glass. Matted and tightly packed, it does not look like human hair anymore. There are thousands of prosthetic devices behind the glass. There are children's chamber-pots in a huge bunker. Mothers who came here with their kids thought they would live here. This neat mound is piled up from ashes and withered bones of a million of people. Certainly, those are human beings too. Well, they think they are. And this is a crowd, the masses, as Hitler used to call it. A crowd. Here, an individual carries no worth. The strength is in numbers - dozens, hundreds of thousands, millions. One chair was left for the Fuehrer. Just one. Just for him. He is going to sit down now. He sat. Chapter Two. "Mein Kampf" or how to treat calf's hides. At approximately the same time a unique copy of Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf, the bible of German Fascism, was printed in an ancient German city. Calves of the best German breed were chosen for the cover. They were skinned, and the hides were tanned on ancient machines. Here you see a tanning machine built in the 1 8th century. Masters, who underwent background checks as far as ten generations made an especially durable parchment from these hides. A team of calligraphy experts re-wrote the book by hand, using special ink, unique quills and a unique typeface, which had been approved by dozens of officials. This footage is taken from a Kulturfilm called "Buch der Deutschen". You can hear the voice of the announcer. It is a long film, and, of course, we could show you only a small portion of it. As to the content of the book, it is a pity that people did not read it carefully. If the Germans had studied it thoroughly, the fate of Germany might have been different. A team of mine workers descended an old German mine and extracted ore. The ore was smelted in special kilns. Binder plates were made out of the ore. These were stainless, refractory steel plates. Here, they are being forged. Now they are going to be affixed, and the book will be ready. It is supposed to last for a thousand years in a perfect condition, without getting tarnished or rusty, because the Reich of Adolf Hitler, the Third Reich was supposed to last for a thousand years. Now, the book is going to be placed in a special sarcophagus. Here. Later, it will be buried in a special mausoleum. Chapter Three. A few words about the author. Adolf Hitler was known to the police since 1 91 2. Here is his police record card. A son of a petty bureaucrat and a mediocre painter, he reached the rank of corporal during World War I. After the war, he became a paid Reichswehr informer. A frequent customer of beer halls, he was sent as a spy... ...to the national-socialist German Worker's Party formed shortly after the war. You can judge by yourself to what extend it can be called a socialist and worker's party... ...while watching this old newsreel showing a procession of party activists and those who reviewed the parade. Hitler liked the party, though. He signed up under Number 7 and set upon a task of becoming a Number One. A petty bourgeois, an ordinary citizen, he understood very well the mentality of the masses. A skillful demagogue, he soon became the principal speaker for the party... ...and was later to become the Fuehrer of the Nazi party. By then, young men in uniform and swastika signs had started to appear on the streets of German towns. Storm troopers - the backbone of the party - are marching here. The ranks of storm troopers were formed from petty bourgeoisie (here goes a butcher, and there is a baker), from petty officials and lumpen proletariat. Party officials did not mind recruiting even common criminals. As Hitler once said: "I need people with strong fists... ...whose principles will not prevent them from taking human life if necessary." Here you see these people with strong fists. "And if on occasion they swipe a watch or a jewel, I don't care a tinker's damn." Commoners peered at this new party and new uniforms with open interest. They were impressed by the music bands, uniforms and swastikas. Initially, Hitler lacked the appearance of a leader. You will see it now. But he practiced, and practiced hard. Here, you see him practicing his speech in front of a mirror. Those are pictures from a photo album kept by his personal photographer. And now you will see how he applies his skills in practice. He delivered speeches frequently and promised a lot. He promised prosperity for everyone, promised to return German lands annexed by the Treaty of Versailles. He promised tenants lower rents, and landlords the opportunity to raise rents. He promised department store owners that he would eliminate competition, and owners of small shops that he would destroy department stores. In short, he was scattering promises generously to left and right. "Sieg Heil!" Rallies and parades of storm troopers were becoming more and more immense in scale. They cost a lot of money, although the party received generous subsidies from unknown sources. For instance, at one of the rallies, the participants consumed about a million or a million and two hundred thousand sausages. And in 1934, the amount of sausages consumed reached two and a half million per rally. The connection with the Reichswehr is seen in every frame. Great importance was attached to traditions and uniforms - starting from the ritual of banner consecration. Just look at Hitler's face. He certainly"grew up,"figuratively speaking. Parades in the cities assumed frightening proportions and resembled state ceremonies, although the future Nazi party did not yet hold the reigns of power. In order to seize this power, the fascists needed Hindenburg. Here he is. An old Imperial General, a close supporter of Kaiser Wilhelm II, Hindenburg became President of German republic by a twist of fate. Respect for the institution of the Kaiser and a thirst for revenge played an important role. He probably did not even realize what the notion "republic" meant, but...Sorry, it seems he is lost...Ah, that's all right, he is going to find the way... There he goes... He did it! So, I was saying that probably did not even know what the republic was; but nevertheless, he became its president. An old aristocrat, he despised Hitler and called him a corporal. However, in 1 933, he received a letter from a group of the most influential German industrialists, the owners of monopolies. To the letter was attached two billion German marks, and those two billion demanded that Hindenburg appointed Hitler to the post of German Reichschancellor. Large business needed a dictator. Hindenburg did not want to appoint Hitler, but two billion marks... You will see now how he parts with twenty pfennig and understand what two billion marks meant to him. There it goes! Gone! He meticulously closes his wallet. Nevertheless, he appointed Hitler as Reichschancellor. Hitler was greeted with the fascist salute. Later Hitler stated, "We managed to persuade the old man in three weeks. He thanked Hindenburg in kind. And now Hitler is finally in his office. In the beginning, he maintains a collegiate attitude; he even refuses to be the first to sit down and offers a seat to his colleagues. The members of his Cabinet included Goering, von Papen, von Blomberg, Frick, Hugenberg - his party comrades and large industrialists. Hitler sits down. From that moment, the fate of Germany took a drastic turn. Chapter Four. Meanwhile... Chapter Four. Meanwhile... Let's see find out what interested western moviemakers during that period, the years of Hitler's rise to power. This is video footage from the World In Review newsreel. Here is the King of England. He was, incidentally, a cousin of Nicolas II. As you can see, he was still alive and kicking then. And here is the former King of Spain. He was also filmed. Look at his face. Does it strike you as a face of an intellectual person? The King of Norway apparently attending a ship launching ceremony. The Dutch Queen descends a ladder accompanying her own yacht. The Swedish King plays tennis. Not bad for a man of his age. Former German Emperor Wilhelm II. He feeds ducks. France, Briand. Hero of World War I Clemenceau, nicknamed The Tiger. French President Lebrun with his family. Important political figures in the West assumed that after coming to power Hitler would introduce a moderate policy. Look at this man! None of the European rulers could imagine the role this man would play in their destinies. Hitler and his entourage visit an opera theater. This event is also considered important enough to be included in the newsreel. A short speech honoring Hindenburg. A seal. It slightly resembles Hindenburg. However, seals are not included in the footage just because of that. They are shown here simply because viewers had been always fascinated by the fact that animals often behave like human beings. So, here they are, appearing in the same program as royalty and Hitler. The 20th century continued its course. It was only the end of its first third. The population of the planet had barely surpassed two billion. This car race reduced it a fraction. It is not 1 964. It is 1934. Looks the same, though. And here is another phenomenon of the 20th century. Cab Calloway - famous jazz singer, the legend of the 1930s. And here is the trendiest song of the 1930s. It was performed in all world capitals. This is New York. It is either London, or Paris. Everything looked normal. Only Marlene Dietrich refused to return to Germany. For political reasons. She is giving an interview. Meanwhile, she is working as a model in Hollywood waiting for her lucky break. And there is a Venus Measurement contest nearby. Sorry, you are not quite a Venus type. Well, that is more like it! These"Venuses" earn their living by "alternative" methods, so to speak. After all, they need to eat somehow. New York, of course. Even this evokes the 20th century. And that, too. Police practicing on dummies - a great show! The reality is almost the same, though. And here is London. There were particular causes of street disturbances here. The focus is the leader of British fascists - Oswald Mosley - here he walks in the middle, here, near the sign, this is Mosley. He heads to a meeting. He plans to deliver a speech. The Londoners are trying to beat him up. The police have to come to his rescue. Marseilles. King Alexander of Yugoslavia arrives in France by invitation of the French Foreign Minister Barthou. Mr. Barthou feared Germany. He was a proponent of closer ties with the Soviet Union... ...and tried to establish friendly relations with Balkan states, as well. Both Barthou and King Alexander were assassinated in the car. The killer was killed at the scene, killed by the police. This assassination bears a striking resemblance to the Kennedy assassination. Later, it was revealed that the assassination was plotted by Berlin, although nobody knew it then. Pierre Laval became Barthou's successor. He favored Germany. He was later charged with treason. The French policy drastically changed, though. Well, let us go back to Germany, though, and see what is going on there. Chapter Five. The Culture of the Third Reich. "Any corporal can become a teacher; not every teacher can become a corporal, though."Adolf Hitler Chapter Five. The Culture of the Third Reich. "Any corporal can become a teacher; not every teacher can become a corporal, though."Adolf Hitler These torch-marches - Fackelzuge - continued for three days in a row after Hitler's coming to power. I look at this river of fire and try to understand the real, deep meaning behind these fire shows. Certainly, they demonstrated the might of the new order; they frightened and excited simple souls. Although, I think their major purpose was to turn a human being into a beast... ...in a course of a solemn ceremony, so that while being dehumanized, people would feel like they were becoming heroes. And we all know too well that the Third Reich desperately needed barbarians ready for anything. Germany needed barbarians primarily to destroy anything that stood in the way of Nazism. Communists were the first targets. They were sent to concentration camps and prisons. Then came the turn of social-democrats, union leaders, labor activists, editors of magazines, newspapers, radio stations - all those who dared to think differently from Hitler. I look at this fiery swastika... ...and cannot but wonder how could it happen that in Germany, a country with great cultural traditions, a mass of semi-literate, self-complacent and narrow-minded people that made every effort to turn human beings into raging barbarians had come to power. They are burning books. At that time, books were burnt in the yards of all universities. Goebbels addressed crowds in front of the Berlin University. He delivered exultant and elaborate speeches. He spoke of the triumph of German spirit, of the new German culture. Meanwhile, students, together with Goebbels' SS troopers, threw books onto bonfires. Which books do you think were burnt? Those authored by Tolstoy and Mayakovsky, Voltaire and Anatole France, Romain Rolland and Jack London. Goebells kept speaking and they kept burning books written by the best German authors: Heine, Thomas and Heinrich Mann, Feuchtwanger, Remarque, Berthold Brecht, and, of course, works of Marx, Engels and Lenin. They burnt the works of the greatest non-Arian scientists. Pearls of human thought were consumed by fire. So, what was left in the end? That's what was left. Here is how the German Academy of Sciences gradually began to appear. Goebbels again is making a speech. He is presenting the new president of the Academy, Seyss-Inquart. He is given a document confirming his authority as president. Seyss-Inquart - the Gauleiter of Austria, a common murderer in short, is delivering his inauguration address. Pay attention to the listening crowd. Quite an interesting bunch... And here is the Academy of Law. Frank is speaking. The crowd looks strikingly familiar. The Academy of Law, incidentally, passed a resolution establishing that the love to Fuehrer is a legal notion; therefore, those who dislike him could be prosecuted according to the Criminal Code. And here is a meeting of large farm owners. Do not confuse this with the meeting of the Academy of Law. The Agricultural Minister Walter Darre is speaking. In attendance is the farmer elite of the new type, the so-called "ploughmen" of the Third Reich. And here is the command of the Empire. Please, meet Mr. Hitler. We could not find a single person person wearing civilian clothes among the crowd, or at least a coat or a hat. Chapter Six. The great nationalist idea in action. Hitler once stated, "If someone finds a scull somewhere, do not say it belongs to our ancestors. I insist that Neanderthal was not our ancestor. We descend directly from the Ancient Greeks." In general, scull proportions were an integral part of the Nazi racial theory. Here you see a lecturer. He shows the world map with the locations of areas where the "right sculls" reside, those of the Nordic type, pure Aryan, pure German. He holds the right scull in one hand, and the wrong one - in another. One hand holds the Nordic scull, and another - a non-Nordic scull. These are people with the right kind of scull. This one. And this one. And that one. Here is an entire row with the right kind of scull. And here is the wrong kind of scull - Alexander Pushkin, a Slav with mixture of Negro blood. Or Leo Tolstoy, for instance. He has the wrong kind of scull, too. Karl Marx is certainly out of the question. And Anton Chekhov. And Mayakovsky. Einstein's scull is even less appropriate, can't you see? And here we finally have a man with the right scull - Martin Bormann. They say he is still hiding his scull somewhere in the Argentinean selva. Or Ernst Roehm, for instance. Such a nice scull. Julius Streicher - the main Nazi "preacher" of racism, obscurantism and anti-semitism. He probably also believes his scull has the perfect proportions. This is Die Deutsche Wochenschau newsreel edition of the Nazi period. We found it in the Goebbels'archives. The announcer says, "Look at the Jews dividing the Soviet riches among themselves." And whom do you think we see? It is Alexander Dovzhenko giving the Stalin Award to Ivan Pyryev. Do you hear the announcer? Right now. And here is Pirogov. Serafimovich. This trick is characteristic of Goebbels' propaganda methods. Here is Tarkhanov. Meanwhile, Streicher continues with his speech. He demands that Germany should be rid of the wrong kind of scull. So Germany started a meticulous clean-up operation. Those with the wrong kind of scull who were wise enough to flee the country before it was too late were saved. See, they have special tags; they leave a ship somewhere abroad. The fate of those who did not want or could not decide to leave was much worse. Here is footage from a propaganda film commissioned by the National-Socialist party. The film describes a perfect procedure for a truly Arian marriage. A doctor asks, "Are documents ready?"- "They are." "Is the bride present?"- "She is."- "Then send her in." Here are the bride and groom. The bride enters the doctor's office. The groom has to wait outside. He is a bit nervous. "Freulein,"the doctor says, "when two young people are joined in matrimony, they assume a great responsibility." We will, however, not translate the doctor's monologue any further. We would rather refer to a higher authority on the subject. In one of his speeches, Kaltenbrunner announced, "We should demand that all married and single German women who have less than four children... ...must conceive from men with an immaculate racial background. Whether these men are married or not is irrelevant. Each family that already has four children must loan a man for this purpose." Look at how attentive the bride is. We are not sure whether the groom is ready to accept Kaltenbrunner's statement. Or this new visitor. Let us continue with the quotes, though. Once Hitler said, "I wanted to do something for the local residents of Berchtesgaden. The population here is not quite pure racially, it is rather weak I should say. However, after a Leibstandart regiment had been stationed in the area for a year, many vivacious, healthy and strong kids appeared in the neighborhood. We must offer similar help to the population of Bavaria and Eastern Prussia, and send elite troops there to enhance the local breed of the population." On other occasion, he stated, "Generally speaking, in a hundred years, the elite part of the German nation will be a product of SS activity." He meant, of course, a special activity, a highly effective activity, so to speak, aimed at provoking the reproduction of purebred Aryan children. Well, the inquiry and check-up seem to be over. Everything is apparently in order. The bride comes out of the office. "Many congratulations,"the doctor says. The groom is exultant. "Thank you, thank you so much, doctor!" "Do not thank me,"says the doctor. "Thank Freulein's ancestors. You can get married now." A few years later, during the war, the Nazis had found another practical way of exploiting the nationalist idea. Soldiers going home on leave received a special sectional cradle. There it is. Soldiers were supposed to give these cradles to their women. They also received an official document stating that if their girlfriends or wives became pregnant it would be considered a patriotic act. Here is a soldier equipped with a cradle. Himmler even issued a special directive, an elaborate directive. It basically ordered women to submit to the sexual advances of soldiers. This woman, as you can see, followed the order. Here, the officials came to her apartment with a bouquet of flowers. They are going to give her a certificate (look, he is going to take it from his pocket). The certificate confirms that both the woman and the baby are authentic Aryans. They called such babies"Gifts from the Fuehrer." However, let jump back several years. In the 1 930s, the so-called "mass processions" became very popular in Germany. The processions, apparently, were meant to prove that 2,000 years of German history were only a prelude to the Third Reich. It appears that fascism starts with a certain nationalist self-importance, when people start to believe that they are better than others just because they are Germans. Looking at these peaceful parades, it is hard to imagine, though, that they were a prelude to the extermination of other nations. Unfortunately, that's what it was. Let us have another look into the future. What you see is the report of Warsaw police chief Jurgen Stroop dealing with the destruction of the Warsaw Jewish ghetto. To prove the authenticity and correctness of the report, it was accompanied by these pictures, of people who had been singled out for elimination and had been eliminated, down to the last person. This picture was attached to the report. These people are ready to die. They are waiting for a shot. They are waiting. The report is signed, "Brigadenfuehrer, Major General of Police Jurgen Stroop." Chapter Seven. Ein Volk, ein Reich, ein Feuhrer. "One people, one Reich, one Feuhrer," referring to the unity of the nation. In order to demonstrate this unity, the whole of Germany would on certain days eat soup at charity soup kitchens. It was part of the Winter Aid campaign. Germany ate soup to the marches played by military bands. Ein Topf - a pot. Huge vats, soup and coins disappearing through the slot in a tin box. Just Like that. It was not just about coins and soup though. It was all for the sake of showing loyalty to the regime. You shared soup with the crowd and therefore exhibited solidarity with the events organized by the Nazi party and governments. As simple as that -just eat soup and drop a few coins. Charity soup events were common even at the chambers of the Reich. The crowd here was more refined, though. Even Hitler attended the eating ceremony. Yet I doubt he ate the soup because he was a vegetarian, strange as it might seem. Nevertheless, he did dole out coins. Here, he puts one in, and now, maybe a second. Let's wait and see. Definitely worth waiting. Still waiting. Well, too bad, cannot wait any longer, but that's all right. Swaying is also a peculiar symbol of unity. It is an old German tradition, though. There is indeed a feel of a common action in swaying. Besides, it helped the commoners to cast away the anxiety that, probably, swept over them once in a while. You swayed with a group of other people, and immediately felt better. Swaying took place on a massive scale in those years. To demonstrate unity, the party leaders - here is Goering - frequently attended public festivities. Archery competitions are a tradition in Germany. Goering shoots. Goering hits the target. I do not know how he fared in real life, but in the film he scored highly. He is served a traditional mug of beer. Where you want it or not, you have to drink it. For the sake of solidarity. Heil!, the Reichsmarshal drinks beer! He finishes the mug and wipes his mouth with the back of his hand, just like the rest of common folk to show again solidarity with people. And here is real solidarity - Goering again but this time with Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach - yes, the one who was commonly known as the king of guns, the king of tanks, the king of everything that kills. On the anniversary of Krupp's industrial empire, the entire Nazi ruling elite paid a visit to this industrial mogul. The Nazi leaders promised to hold back the greedy German capital once. Now, they are queuing for a handshake. Himmler, the Gestapo chief is in the line, as well. Here comes his turn, finally. He obviously does not hold back this time. A short embrace. Another one. These celebrations clearly showed the real essence of the economic program of Nazi Germany (this is Hess, Hitler's deputy in the Nazi party leadership). Here is the Krupp family. Krupp junior - the owner of Krupp industries in today's Germany will appear in an minute from the right. The speaker is Krupp senior, the father. Aren't you curious as to how he is going to end the speech? Krupp's speech. "Heil Hitler!"- that's how he ends it. And here is another exhibition of solidarity, this time - on the basis of Autobahns, or highways. The construction of highways is not a big deal, you might say, but those were strategic highways, the first steps to war. Hitler is going to deliver a speech in a moment. He will do it in his usual excitably manner. He starts fairly hesitantly and gradually works himself up to a crescendo of shouting and gesticulation. There we go. He is raging. He is raging, incidentally, about fairly mundane matters. We must work, we must work hard, and we must build highways. In short, workers - to work! Obviously, one could have announced the same things in a much calmer way. Yet his style appealed to the public. Achtung! Fuehrer starts digging. Loose soil goes down from a special car. Let's roll back the frame. Look at this man behind Hitler. Here we go. Like this. And like that. And like that. Goering opens the construction of the second highway, Rudolf Hess - the third. A fuehrer of a lower rank opens the construction of a smaller highway. He does not look too excited about digging, does he? Am I done, yet! Thank Goodness, I can go now! Here is an industrial exhibition. It clearly demonstrates where Germany was heading. Submarines. Tanks. Planes. Bombs. And a portrait of Fuehrer hanging above it all. Chapter Eight. About myself. Chapter Eight. About myself. "My mother was an ordinary woman, but she gave Germany an extraordinary son." Adolf Hitler. My uniform cap en face. My uniform cap half-face. I am against a mountain background. I am against a sea background. I am with a squirrel. I am with a girl. I am with lions. And here I am with my fans. This is my birthday cake. The bakers were searched, just in case. Here is another present. Socks that German women knitted specially for me. "Me and Siegfried"- a painting by an unknown author. A pity, I am peeking from under his armpit. I would prefer the other way round. I am in a good mood. I am in a bad mood. I Cannot remember what was wrong. Here I am in a good mood again. Mussolini is in the background, but you do not have to pay attention to him for now. Wow! An autograph! Well, there is always an obliging back available. I crossed my arms over my chest. Later, I found a better place to stick them. A rare occasion - I am wearing a tuxedo while reviewing the guards of honor detachment. The tailor was paid in kind. True, the fit is perfect! I am going to leave now. I am delivering a speech. By the way, in this speech, Hitler announced that he had achieved everything in his life, imagine, by pure dedication and hard work. He complained about the hard times he went through in his childhood and youth, including even starvation, but, nevertheless, he had stubbornly pursued his glorious goal, had overcome"unimaginable" obstacles and had finally reached it. "No, it was not intelligentsia that gave me strength," Hitler continued and stated that he had always found support among the workers and peasants. No wonder, it was the 20th century; who else he could lean on, after all? Even Erhard had to count on workers and peasants. Hitler delivered a great variety of speeches. They are all rather banal in terms of context, but he certainly delivered them with a lot of fanfare. In addition, all his conversations at various events have been recorded. It is a true treasure-trove of"wisdom." Hitler stated that only the Germans represent a true nation of rulers called upon to dominate the entire world. In his opinion, Slavs were the innate race of slaves; it was necessary to eliminate the majority of Russians and the remaining ones should not be educated. Ukrainians should wear beads, like all colonized nations; Arabs were"lacquered monkeys," Italians were lazy and there was only one decent person among Romanians - Antonescu, for that matter. Switzerland was a "pimple on the face of Europe," and if the Swiss-germans had not shown such strength of spirit, it should have been eliminated as well. "In general," Hitler announced, "I alone have the right to decide which nation will exist and which nation must be exterminated." For instance, in this speech, Hitler said, "Some people claim: the Fuehrer is "a Gift of God", but the party is something else." "No, my friends,"he continued, "I am the party." The announcement provoked an overwhelming response and he had to wait for the loud applause to subside. "And as long as I am part of the Party," Hitler continued, "the Party is part of me." Just think about it - the Nazi party is part of Adolf Hitler himself. It is a pity he was not specific about what part he was talking about. He concluded his speech in the following manner, "And if I ever die, my spirit will live forever!" "Sieg Heil!" Many great historical figures had a habit of keeping their arms crossed. Yet Hitler finally discovered another place to keep them - to put it delicately - below his waist. He stubbornly kept them in this position. If his right hand was occupied, he would put his left arm there. People started to imitate his gesture. The number of imitators was growing. The first to follow Hitler's example was chief of the Gestapo Himmler. Hitler used to call him "my loyal Heinrich." It was more difficult for Goering because of his beer-belly. But Roehm and Hess also followed this example. Hess is on the right, Roehm is on the left. Roehm was the commander of storm troopers and one of Hitler's closest supporters. However, during one parade of storm troopers, he made a grave mistake. Hitler invited him to join him in the car, just to be polite, but Roehm took it seriously and jumped in the car. Apparently, he did not read Mein Kampf thoroughly. In the book, Hitler clearly stated that the party must have a single leader, not two. Besides, Roehm certainly did not hold any great popularity among the military brass who feared the storm troopers. In short, they had to shoot him, and Hitler's personal photographer had to spoil several photos. Well, enough about Hitler. Why do we keep talking about him? We should say a few words about Mussolini, instead. Here he is. After all, he was Hitler's predecessor and the word "fascism" has Italian origins. Mussolini had invented this gesture, and Hitler simply mimicked it. Mussolini was the first to swing a pickaxe while digging ground, and Hitler just followed suit with a shovel. And, of course, Mussolini sometimes could handle a threshing machine, and Hitler simply would never dare to attempt such a feat. As for self-promotion (you can see DUCE written everywhere. Il Duce in Italian means the Leader, the Fuehrer) ...So, as to self-promotion. Mussolini surpassed even Hitler himself. You could not find such a giant wall in the Third Reich. Mussolini's torch marches, in contrast, were poorly organized, though. It seems as if they are going to set the whole of Rome on fire. Hitler once commented that Mussolini was undoubtedly a descendant of Caesar. Maybe so. Look there, in the background. His portrait will to appear over the crowd in a second. Pretty amusing, isn't it? And here is the Duce delivering a speech. His gestures, his facial expressions are rather peculiar. Just look at him. What is curious, though, is the fact that the right side of the picture is blackened out. Apparently, there is someone there who irritates Mussolini, and the Nazi filmmakers decided to cover that part of the picture. It is probably Victor Immanuel, the Italian king. Mussolini despised him for being short, and in general disliked and envied. Look. The content of the speech is irrelevant. You must see his face rather than listen to what he is saying. Look at the Duce. His facial expressions are rather funny. Great stuff! He is great, isn't he? There! And here he definitely shows some similarities with Hitler. All right, we are done with Mussolini. We are going to show you some of his sculptures, instead. Besides, we move to the topic of Nazi art. Chapter Nine. Nazi Art. "Once in a while we should wag a finger at our actors and artists"Adolf Hitler. You might think it is another parade. You are wrong. It is Hitler attending an exhibition of sculpture and fine art. Incidentally, Hitler chose the artwork for the exhibition himself. Look closely at the face of this soldier. Here is Hitler again. And again. And again. At least some space left for Goering. "What can I do?"the statue seems to complain. And here is what was not shown at the exhibition, and actually could not be shown. This is the art studio of Joseph Torak, the leading sculptor of the Third Reich. Hitler once said, "When we walk representatives of conquered peoples through Berlin, they must be both impressed and dispirited by the grandeur of our monuments." True, there is certainly a lot of material here. Huge bundles of muscle and the total absence of thought. Only horses represent the animal world. And here is a special case - a monument to a warrior-conqueror. Such monuments, 30-meters high, were supposed to be installed along the borders of the New Reich - in the Urals, at the White Sea, at the Black Sea, and in the Caucasus. The statue of a slave - that was our destiny - has been carved, as well. And here is the sculptured head of a conqueror. Do not expect mercy from someone like that. Let us move to literature, though. Goethe and Schiller between two swastikas. A book fair was held in this house in Weimar. Goebbels was among the visitors. Of course, his books were assigned a special place. A lot of work went into it. The author is pleased. As to the contents of other sections of the book fair, you can judge by these stands. Hitler is here. Hitler is there. Hitler is in Italy. Hitler is at his birthplace. Just like that. And here are the writers.They are led by a moderate protection detail to breakfast. The food is pretty good. As to writers themselves, well, do not ask for more - what's left, is left. Later, they listen to Goebbels' instructions - what to write and how to write. They take note. They discuss their creative plans. And this is the world of performing arts, theater and cinema. After all, common people need to relax once in a while, enjoy the"beautiful life." Nice, very nice. The difference between these girls and, let's say, American girls, or French and British girls is the size of their thighs. The girls of the Third Reich had to have robust thighs. And here is Marika Roekk - the superstar of German cinema. A little bit of sex. After all, the life of common citizens of the Third Reich was not easy; they had to work hard and put in long hours; there was shortage of food supplies. Goering insisted that butter was fattening and had to be replaced by something else in daily rations. Here is a decent replacement for you. And people loved it! They still love it. I am afraid people will always love it. A comic duet. The size of the thighs is the same, standard. This standard is different, though. This is a vamp, and a vamp must be skinny by definition. You fantasize about her, and go back to your official wife and boring job. Yet this performance was considered the most important type of art in the Third Reich. A parade - that was the true form of art. It is here where imagination could really let fly and creative inspiration brought excellent results. It became immensely popular among masses. Here is a first-class solo performer! Just look at the inspired performance of this virtuoso. Guess, who this man is. It is von Richthofen, the commander of the Condor Legion. It was he who bombed Guernika, Madrid, and later - Stalingrad. Bravo! Encore! End of Part I
