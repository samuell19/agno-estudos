[Ominous music building up] Behonkus. Behonkus. Behonkus, booty. Erica, get your booty over here. Yeah, this is a couch of love, a love seat. God dammit. No. [Patting the sofa] - What's happening? - Love. I'll have you know, you have to memorize every single line to this cinematic masterpiece before you graduate. We don't know what any of it means, but Tori's communist grandpa owns it for some reason. All right, yeah. He's probably, definitely a communist but on an equally important note, we would like to officially welcome you to your first river house trip - A.K.A. "Baby Shower Break." - Baby Shower Break? Yeah! You know because this is like our last hoorah together before you bring your new freshman into our little Delta family with rush. My little baby Erica's all grown up. I'm gonna be a grandma. So, enjoy some pregnancy wine before you push that little bastard out, though I'm sure that little bastard will be great. You'll make a good choice, just like Britt did with you. Aww. - Uh, are we playing a game? - Shut up. Of course, we are! Why else would I be wearing my Christmas socks? I'm sorry, what socks were those again? They're my competition socks. You wore those to like every single house dinner last year. - Yeah, for purposes of competition. - Okay, Brittany. So anyway, we will be playing several games, while at the same time paying close attention to this landmark in film history. So, whose team do you want to be on? - I'll be with Britt. - [Tori] Bitch! You're a bitch. Kidding. I love you all. So, let's start, bitches. And I'll have you know, this is my week off, so, I'm drinking you dip-shits into the ground. What are the rules? I don't know. He hit a woman. Wine chug. [Muted laughs] [Erica] Good morning. [Britt] Morning, little one. [Britt] I'd watch out. Why? [Britt] There might be jellyfish in there. [Britt] You see any? I don't see anything. Tori will probably know. You ever been stung by one? [Britt] No. And I don't plan on it. Have you? There aren't that many in Detroit. [Britt] I smell sass. This part right here is called the "Heel Stomp" and it's the deepest part of the cove, but, more importantly, it's where I learned to swim. Aw. Anyone care for a throwback? Let's swim, people! Are there jellyfish in there? I don't know. Yeah, I'm out. Erica? Would a tube work better for you, princess? I mean if they're in there they can still... You're fine in a tube. They're not known for jumping unless those bastards at SeaWorld force them to. So, who's going first? You've got this, Little. Be the crash test dummy. Yeah, like shit. You just nominated yourself. - I'll go. - [Britt] Yeah, go Little. No. No. Man up, Brittany. Okay, fine. I'll go if you stop calling me that. No deal. Take pictures for my parents! Wah! [Tori] Watch for her signals. [Erica] Yes, Captain. She says, "faster." Roger. [Erica] Woo! Go, Britt! Faster. Roger Dodger! She says, "faster." All right, I can do faster. She says, "slow down." Slower. I can't hear you, it's too windy. [Erica] Oh, shit. Tori, she fell. Tori. Oh my God! She's fine. [Erica] Come on. It's a joke. Relax. [Britt] Okay, now we're even. [Britt] Man, you looked like you were going to shit your pants out there, but you held on longer than I would have, though... [girls chattering] Hey. Team Britt is winning tonight. I've got the socks for it. Okay, Britt. She's so unique. Wow. Oh, yeah. It's awesome, Brittany. Hey, could you actually stop calling me that? No. Mm! Kid smoking. [Thunder roaring] All right, let's play this game. Shit. We need more cards. More cards? What is this game? - How dare you question the game! - Shut up, shut up. I'm focusing. Oh wait! Before we start, you should go upstairs and change into your pajamas. Mm! Wait! Uh, actually yeah, but choose a team first. I'll be on yours. [Thud] - [knocking on door] - Erica. - [Knocking on door] - Erica? [Gasps] Oh God! [Britt] No. No. She's okay. She's okay, right? She's okay, right? She's okay. She's fine. She's fine. [Muttering] [Britt] What are you doing? [Britt] Tori? [Britt] No. We can't do this, we have to call somebody! We can't call anyone. No! I think we can, we can just explain to them... What can we explain? That we killed her? We killed her. Something bad happened. She's gone, but we need to save our lives now. Please, just wait for a second! We can... Britt! Focus. She's not coming back, and we can cry later, but we need to do this now. It was just an accident, Tori. Let's just call... We are fucked if we call anyone! Do you understand? She's dead. Ruining our lives isn't going to stop her from being fucking dead. Something bad happened, and it happened, but we need to protect us now. It's what she would have wanted. No. Look, Erica! Tori. Get pillows. One for her head and two for her feet, to keep them elevated. Look at me. Look at me! Everything is fine. She's okay. Tori. Stop! She's fine. She's soaking wet. We're soaking wet. I'll think of something. Mom I... [mumbling] Erica. It's me, Tori. [Erica moaning] My head. Ugh! My neck! Oh, my neck! Britt, can you get her ice? [Breathing rapidly] Erica, do you know where you are? My head hurts. My head-- my head hurts. Focus. Erica, focus. Do you know where you are? I'm-- at my friend's house-- my friend's house. Good. Good. - What happened? - Do you remember your name? I was on a boat. Do you know your name? - Come on. - Ah... Do you remember who you are? I'm Erica. It hurts really bad, Tori! It hurts! Britt, come on! Argh! Erica, do you remember what happened? No. - What happened? - You had an accident. We just need you to lay still, okay? I'm wet. I'm wet. [Tori] We're going to take you up to Britt's room. We'll explain everything in the morning. We just need to get you dry and rested. [Erica moaning] [Erica] You don't think I should go to the hospital, just to be safe? [Tori] No. It's storming too hard out. We're going to keep you here. Can you change into those yourself? Erica? Yeah. I'm okay. All right. Well, we'll be back up so just change into them and then don't fall asleep. [Mumbling] [Britt and Tori arguing] Stop. She's fine. - No, she's really-- - She's not that... [Tori] Erica? [Erica] Everything. Everything. Everything. What the fuck? You were burying me. [Tori] Where are you going? I think I have to go. [Erica] Please. - I have to go. I need to go home. - Erica, stop. You're upset. Why? Why would you do that? Give me my phone. I need my phone. We were just pulling a prank. We didn't mean for anything to happen. I just-- I need my phone. [Tori] Erica, if you tell anyone, our lives are ruined. I want my phone! Britt, hold her down! [Struggling noises] - Wait, let me go. - Tori, what are we doing? I don't know. - Wait, let me go. - [Britt] Tori. We can't let her go. We have to now. Just wait a second. Just talk to me. Oh my God! Oh my God! Hey, I'm right here, okay? I'm right here. I can fix this. I just need time. What do you mean, fix this? I'm right here. Please, I'm right here. I'm right here! I don't know. I don't know yet. [Screaming] [Tori] You need to get up. Come on. Come on. Anyone want breakfast? No? Okay. Shit. Britt. I'm gonna need you in here for this. So, things got a bit dramatic last night, but I just wanna say that I'm so happy that you're okay. - Tori, please untie me. - Just don't interrupt me. We're going to keep you in the chair for now, but we need you to help us. You're not serious. Guys, this hurts. This really fucking hurts. - No, I have to go to a hospital. - Stop yelling. You're in a chair, you're not on fire. I'm sorry that this happened to you, but I can't let you go, you understand? - I need to know that you're not going to tell anyone. - I'm not going to tell anyone. I know. I believe you, but I just need to find a way to be sure. So, help us and then we can get back to having fun. You know, believe it or not, Erica, we're in this together. What if I have to go to the bathroom? Well, just yell. I have to go to the bathroom. Watch her. I guess now we know. [Music playing in earphones] ¶ Lead me astray ¶ ¶ Go tell ¶ ¶ My baby sister ¶ ¶ Don't... ¶ What the fuck? He didn't say anything about workers. [Britt] They must be here because of the storm. [Tori] Fuck. Do you think that they saw her? I mean, they would be doing something, right? [Knocking on door] [Tori] Well, shit. Good afternoon, my name's Calvin and you must be Tori. - Yeah. - Well, it's so nice to finally meet you, may I step in? Sure. [Trying to scream] [Calvin] Funny thing is, last time we met, you were about up to my ankles. - [Music playing] - [Calvin] Anyhow, I should probably tell you why I'm here. We've got some... [Calvin] We've got another guy out front, taking care of one that's blocking the driveway so you're going to hear a little noise, but... [stifled moans] [Calvin] Another fella out front, working on one that's blocking the driveway. We get some pretty bad storms here, but nothing like that one. Yeah. Yeah, I bet. Yeah. Uh thank you, it was really nice meeting you. My pleasure, little lady. So where are you going to school? [Mouthing] [turning up the music] - It was really nice to meet you. - Everything good here? You weren't expecting us, were you? What? Oh heck, I won't tell your granddaddy. I just want to make sure you know these boys and they're not up to something stupid. It's my boyfriend and his friends. They're from school. Please don't tell my grandpa. Oh, don't you worry about it. A hundred years ago, I was a boy, myself. [Game buzzing] [inhaling and coughing] - Let me go. - [Tori] What happened in there? [Tori] Did they just fall? Work with us! It's not like you're doing anything else! God! Hi. Yes, this is his granddaughter. No, absolutely wonderful. I just talked to Grandpa Craig and he said that since more storms are coming, we're just going to hold off on the yard service until the end. Ah-ha. Hm-hm. You too. Okay, buh-bye! Did you take my phone? Did you take everything? Hey! Do you even have a plan, or have you just gone completely insane? [Tori] Got someone you need to call? We can't do this to her. It's Erica. This has to stop! Can we skip this fucking part? Can we skip this whole bit where you think you're innocent in this? I'm a fucking monster and you're just a bystander? How about the part where we go to fucking jail over an accident? The constant fucking work that I've done my entire life is just ruined? We have three days, Britt, to figure this shit out so wake the fuck up! It doesn't end here. It can't. So, what do you think is going to happen? Is she just going to start loving us again and forget about this whole thing? Are we just waiting it out? Please just tell me what the end game is. We have the endgame, Britt. I just would really rather change it. [Water sizzling] I learned this from Elmo's World. I'm very classy. So, I heard you're going to Prague next year. You'll have to learn proper spaghetti eating before you go. I don't know if spaghetti is actually a thing there. I don't know anything about Prague. But it'll be great to hear about. I mean, that'll be fun. That'll be a really good experience for you. [Erica] Please. Please. Tori. Tori, come on, I need food or something. Please. Please. Hello. Tori can I please have some more? Tori, can I have some more water? Please. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I didn't want any of this to happen to you. Please forgive me. I thought you were my friend. - We had to. Things just got out of hand. - You're a coward. Do you think you would have done any differently? I never would have done this to anyone. I don't believe you. Bad shit happens and that just as easily could have been me. I know you and I've watched you. Oh, yeah? What do you know about me? Go ahead. I know that you definitely wouldn't have done anything for me. Not if it meant going against your idol. You know what? You're the lucky one in that chair. This whole thing is out of your hands, so you just get to sit there and relax. Not me. So, why don't you make yourself useful and think about what you would do if you were me? What you would actually do, because I know what I'd be doing if I were you. I never would have done this to you. But I would now. [Thud] [buzzing] [buzzing and thumping] [Tori] Come on! Get in the fucking car. [Tori] There she is. [Tori] Son of a bitch. [Tori yelling] Where ya going? There's nobody that way! Aw, atta girl! Come on bitch, run! You're doing great! Run, bitch, run! Run, bitch, run! Run, bitch, run! Run, bitch, run! Run, bitch, run! Oh, my fucking hero! Okay, Britt, get out. Britt, get out! Erica, please, just get in the car. Please? Come on. [Tori] Britt, just grab her! What the fuck are you doing? Brittany! [Tori] Move! Move! [Car running and stopping] [Tori] Fuck! [Tori] It's stuck. Go get the ATV! Get up! Keep running! [Firing a shot] I'm not fucking around! Keep going. You like to run? Run. - [Shooting] - Ah! More. More. More. [Knocking on door] [knocking on door] When this is over, whatever happens, we're never going to see each other again. Yeah. Okay. I don't care. I need to know if we have a plan. A real plan. I'm working on it. That's not good enough. I think Calvin knows. What do you mean? Is that him? Is that him? You think he knows? Why do you think he knows? A truck's been coming by. So what if he knows? What do we do about it? We need to figure this out. That's what I'm doing. I don't think I trust you, to be honest. Yeah. Okay. What? Nothing. You know that place where I learned to swim, in the middle of the cove? Well, Grandpa tried to teach me at shore. So, he'd hold his arms out, and I'd paddle towards him, and he'd back away slowly. And I'd panic of course, but my brothers were always there to jump in after me even though Grandpa yelled at them for it. And you know what? I didn't learn to fucking swim. So, he took me out on the boat, out to where I took you. He gave me a big hug for the first time in I don't know when. And then he picked me up, he threw me over the side, and then he drove away so fast that my brothers didn't even have time to jump in after me. And he left me there in the deepest part. And he didn't come back for a few minutes. Sure, as hell, I learned to swim in under thirty seconds. You're nearing the deep end, Brittany. Start paddling. You wanna see the plan? Come with me. All right. I think I'm funny. I wonder how you... No. No. Sorry, not sorry. We're not doing this tonight. Jesus, like I get it, but it kinda just is what it is at this point. Is that just from a few days? Jeez, you drew a genetic short straw. I feel for you girl, but I am not shaving them. I will, however, fix your gasoline breath because you're stinking up the place. Think that one SpongeBob episode where SpongeBob-- well, you know what I'm talking about. Open. Tongue. [Choking] Really? That's it? It's not looking good, is it? This. No. Well, let's make the most of it then. We came here to have a week off. That'll do, pig. Yeah, that's something. Your turn. Oh, for fuck's sake. [Music playing] ¶ But I'm a different man When I think about ¶ ¶ The way she broke my heart Until the day she left ¶ ¶ I'm the part that loves her And wants her for my own ¶ ¶ I'm the part that hates her 'Cause she's gone... ¶ I win! Fuck, yeah. T-Dog! I just keep winning. What ya got? What ya got? Ten of diamonds? You give the worst clues. Absolutely horrible. Do better. God, I'm exhausted. Are you exhausted? Yeah. I'm exhausted. Yeah, but you don't give up though. I'm sorry that this had to happen to you. I actually really like you. I've just been working my whole life. It was all starting to come together and then this. None of this needed to happen. Yeah. Maybe. But this part doesn't come yet. You've got a fire in you and you need to let it out. What are you doing? Careful. I might miss. Night. It's me. Get up. Get the fuck up. Jesus! What, Brittany? Did you do something to her? Did you do something to her? She got her monthly visit. I don't even know if I can believe you. What, do you think I fucking raped her? You are crazy. I don't know what to believe. Hey. Watch yourself, Brittany. Call me that again. Calm down. Is this your master plan? Is that what this shit is-- your plan? I needed to test her. Test her? You're not testing her, you are torturing her. How's your plan coming along, St. Brittany? Don't you dare put shit on me. You did this. I'm sorry. Is that what you actually think? It was your trap. I just covered your stupid ass. No, you were the one who dragged her downstairs... We did, we dragged her. You're seriously going to try that selective memory shit this late in the game? I am trying to save us. I'm trying to save her life. From what? It's just you. You have done nothing but cover your own tracks, so if you're not going to help me just let me fucking do it because I can't fucking take this. I can't take this. So, what? Am I supposed to trust you? How am I supposed to trust you? How do I know you're not going to go to the police and just tell them everything? Why would I do that? Because you're a coward. Okay, Tori. So, what are you going to do? Are you going to shoot me in the fucking head? Is that part of your plan too? Read it yourself, Brittany. You're fucking insane. Watch yourself, Brittany. Or what, Tori? - You're going to lose your goddamn teeth. - Excuse me? Wow. Big, brave girl. You are such a fucking cunt. [Erica, faintly] Britt. You have to do something. She's going to kill me. Then she's going to kill you. She's not right. [Thumping] You just have to forget. What are you doing? [Erica moaning] Stop! Please! This won't work. [Erica screaming] [Tori screaming in pain] Kill her, Britt! [Tori] Britt, what the fuck are you doing? Ah! [Moaning] I fucking want to. Ruin it for me. Come on, ruin it. He's coming back early because of the storms. He'll be here in the morning. Britt. We have tonight. For all this we have tonight. Shit, right? Why does that change anything? What do you think is going to happen? Explain it to everyone and then they'll be cool with it? Or are you just going to try to cover my blood and guts in a night and hope that Erica plays along? Because as far as she's concerned, as far as anyone's concerned, she's innocent and somebody has to take the blame. I get it. I'm crazy, but I have to be on your side and you have to be on mine. We both need the same thing. Britt. Fuck you. Fuck you both! [Tori] What's the password? Come on. What are you going to do? See if there's anything to blackmail you with. 8224. Do you have anything? No. Nothing? Were those from my mom? What did she say? Tell me what she said, please. Please tell me what she said. Please. - She loves you. - So, help. This happens now, either way. Why? I want you to know what we're fucking capable of. Are you still going to tell people what happened here? I won't. That's what I was afraid of. Don't move. Relax. Just know that I'm only going to hurt you because I have to. And take this moment to think about the process and how you can help speed it along because we're out of time. You ready? Good. Make me believe you. I don't believe you. - I won't tell anyone. - I don't fucking believe you. Don't make me do this. - I won't tell anyone, I swear! - Bullshit! What do you want? I'll take naked pictures. What, are we in sixth grade? No, no, no, I think we're done with that so why don't you just make me smell it on your breath? Do you know what will happen if you tell anyone? Are you going to tell anyone? No. I fucking swear! Fuck that. You watch the news? You should. It's got some interesting stuff. Pour it. Are you going to tell anyone? Just say the safe word. Are you going to tell anyone? I won't. I won't. [Tori] Fill it back up. Relax. Relax. Breathe. Breathe. Your turn. Harder. [Erica] I don't care anymore. Do it. [Tori] Are you going to tell anyone? Are you going to tell anyone? Yes. I'll tell everyone. I'll tell everyone. [Tori] I don't believe you. How many shots do you think that was? You haven't eaten in a while. A few more, you'll be drunk. A few more, you pass out. Then after that, you're just a cautionary tale for people on prom night. I'm done fucking with you. Shut the fuck up. It's over. It's fucking over. You're just getting off on this shit so just do it already. I don't even care. Just do it. I want you to live, even if you don't. I don't believe you. Maybe another drink would help. You know, you've got an awful lot of vodka on you. It'd be a shame if someone... [voice from fire alarm] Fire. Please vacate the premises. Fire. - Fire. Please, vacate the premises. Fire. - Get the alarm. Fire. Please, vacate the premises. Fire. Fire. Please, vacate the premises. Fire. Fire. Please, vacate the premises. Fire. - Fuck. - Fire. Please, vacate the premises. Fire. Cancel. Cancel. Fire. Please, vacate the premises. Fire. Are they coming? I don't know. Get the keys to the boat. Bring the vodka. The gun. [Man] You smell that? [Man] It's like something's burning. [Man] Shouldn't we be kind of concerned about that? [Man] What in the hell? What? What do we do? Is there anyone else in the house? You just missed them. Calvin, she saw our faces. I know! Go start on the safe. - Jesus Christ! - Hey. What happened to you, sweetheart? You're not going to call the cops, are you? No. I thought the place was empty. No car. No lights. Who did this? - Where's Tori and her friend? - Just shoot me. What happened to you? Just shoot me. What's your name? How old are you? - When God spoke to Abraham... - Don't make a fucking speech. Just shoot me. I'm tired. I'm tired and so if you're going to do it, please just shoot me. - Sweetheart... - Please. Come on. Come on, you coward. Come on. Shoot me! I'm right here. I'm right here! I'm right here. It's okay. It's okay. You're okay. Nobody's going to hurt you, okay? You're okay. You're okay, darling. [Firing a shot] Thank you. [Tori on the phone] Hello? We need police or an ambulance. Two men broke into the house we're staying in and attacked us. No. We were able to protect ourselves. I think they're dead, but please send help quick. Thank you. I'm really scared. [Erica] Yeah, everything's fine. I promise. Just tired. Yeah. Hey, I have to go. It's starting. Okay. I love you too. Bye. [No sound]
