Go straight to the pit of Hell! Don't you dare put your foot on this soil again! Damn your dam! I won't let them tear down my house! Mother, stop it, you're shaming us. To take everyone's land, to demolish houses... isn't that shaming too? Even if they don't demolish it, the house will be flooded. Do you think the "Great Peoples Dam Project" will stop just because you or I don't like it? I won't let my house be demolished. May it be flooded by the waters. As you please. And don't think, I don't know what you want! Sell the house and move to town, isn't that it? - That's right. What's keeping us here? - Just this house. As I've said, you'll be forced to come too I hope you don't leave it too late. I won't come! And I won't let them demolish the house. Do you hear me! - Forget about moving to town. Do you hear? - I'm not deaf. I'll take the milk. Wait. Mother, really, you're getting crazy. - Who will look at my face here? - There are dirty dogs everywhere. They'll look, as in old times. You just marry, then you can muck about as much as you like. Forget about moving to town, do you hear! - Are you pleased? - Don't be late. - If you squirt anything on me, you'll be sorry. - Sorry eh? Come here, pal! - Hit him hard! - Didn't I tell you not to squirt! Forget about his cheek. - Stop this foolish joke. - Let go, boss. He thinks he's funny. Clear-off, you lot. Stop it. And be quick. - Let go of the hose. - But I have, Chief. How often have I told you not to touch? That madman's truck. We'll catch him on the road one day, him and his shitty truck. Istanbuler! I hope it'll be a long trip. What do you say, my friend? Miss Dilek. Please, Miss Dilek. Did I spoil your fun, Istanbuler? Don't give in to this bum. - Why did you call me? - There's a job for you, carrying some sand to the dam. I won't drive my truck across that mud. You're a strange man, Istanbuler. Nobody else would've cared. The truck is company property. You were going to give me long distance jobs? You love your truck more than me. I'm jealous. I decorated him with my own hands. Doing tours 100 times a day across that dirty mud... I just don't like dirty jobs... I'll invent something and give you another job in a few days. Are you happy? I'm sorry, my friend. They gave me a shitty job, my friend. Come on, let's pull across this mud. Now we've eaten shit. That Dilek woman does it on purpose! She's jealous of you. Didn't she tell me herself? Don't just stand there, man. Don't wait in vain, Granny. I can't take you with me now. I'm no Granny. Well, what are you? Wow! What a pretty girl. A handsome young man. Not from here, that's for sure. I mustn't frighten the little partridge. If mother would hear of it... Red head-scarfed girl, one minute. If I stayed I won't be able to save myself. Give me some milk, woman. Like a baby suckling. Crazy guy. I'm all yours, my friend. You'll get me out of this mud. Dirty mud, let go of us! Pull, my lion. I wonder if he's coming? I caught a partridge on the plain... I fastened her red scarf on the branches of a fir tree... Sikidi mikidi... let me dance. Sikidi mikidi... let me dance. Let me take you where you're going. Is this fellow from Istanbul? At the foot of the mountain, we've become woman-chasers with a private car. That's great! Jump up, I'll drop you at the village. Mother will kill me! Mountain gazelle. Will she get in? Won't she get in? Shall I get in? Sha'n't I get in? Will I ever see him again? She'll get in... she'll get in. Is it a sin if my heart is slipping? I don't care if mother hears of it. We've done it, my friend! My name's Ilyas. And my truck's name is "Heart, don't be angry". What's your name, red-bescarfed girl? She doesn't talk with us, my friend. Well, why doesn't she talk? You're saying she doesn't think we're gentlemen? No problem. Her smile is enough for us. Let me off here. If I get stuck in the mud again in the same place, tomorrow at the same time, will you come and help me? I wouldn't know. Over there at the path, someone might see me. I'll wait for you at the ruins, red-scarfed girl. I won't leave if you don't tell me your name. Asya. Is she mad? Uncle shall wring your neck! Where the hell have you been again? Wash your face and change your dress. The match-maker has arrived from the mountain village. Quick! Don't ever make me blacken my face, swear it! Swear it, or I'll come out like this. I don't care what the marriage-maker will think. Good God, this girl has gone crazy. Alright, no more black face. I swear it by God. May God give me misery. He's given it already anyway. - Will mother arrange your marriage? - What do you know about it? Today the match-maker came by, they even talked to father. Will you marry, sister? Does mother leave me anything to say? - Don't marry! - Why? If you marry you'll go away. I won't. And if I go I'll take you with me. When I'm old, I want to be a driver. I'll take you away. I'll take you even to Istanbul. - Let give it a name. - Alright. The name will be... Don't be angry, heart. Asya... Asya. Asya! - Where are you running to, girl? - To Aunt Halime, to fetch the spindle. - You're all dressed up just for Halime? - If you want, I'll blacken my face. - Get lost! - I'm sick to death of it all. You'll marry and leave home. You'll put on some henna. Put some henna on yourself. Come back quickly. Tomorrow the bridegroom's side will arrive. We must make preparations. May your bridegroom give you lots of trouble. The red-scarfed girl won't come, my friend. If she doesn't come to us, we'll go to her. That's it, he's gone in. - If she asks, tell her that I didn't stay with you, that I went to Aunt Hanife. - Ok. What's happened, girl? Go away! Go away! Ilyas... Girl... You've come to demolish my house! I'd rather drown under the waters, but I won't let you touch my house. You'll find me hard to defeat. Damned scoundrels... Get lost! May your dam be drowned! May your neck be strangled! Damned scoundrel! - Go away! - I won't if I can't take you with me. - I beg you, go away. - You'll come to the ruin tomorrow. - I'll come. Now go away. - I love you, my red-scarfed girl. What were you saying, girl? Me? Nothing?... I told him to bugger-off... You did well. I almost threw a stone at him. Did the building site people send him? I don't know. Probably. They think they can frighten me. Even if I have to leave I won't. I wish I too had such a painted truck. Didn't I tell you your friend would come. Good day, my red-scarfed girl. Don't ever look for me again. I've come to tell you that. Why? I'll get married soon. Couldn't they have given this pretty girl to us, my friend? What if you didn't get married? Do you love your fianc?? - Why, I don't even know him. - You don't know him? Asya... wait! What if he's old? Or has a limp? Maybe he's blind in both eyes. He won't even be able to find you. But I found you, my red-scarfed girl. And I don't want to lose you. But I have nothing to say in this. Asya. When he talks like that I feel really sick. I can't do anything if I don't see you. What shall I do? I'll wait for you here tomorrow. If they only let me, I'd come running to you. My red-scarfed girl. Heart-breaker? He's become tired of waiting, is that it? He's left us, hasn't he? Does one leave the beloved so quickly? You're his friend, you'll know. He's the craziest of men, you say? Impossible, one cannot call one's friend crazy. You say he's hid somewhere and watches us? I don't believe you. Don't you think it improper to talk about a man behind his back? You were right. We've been waiting since noon. But here I am. I would have waited for a month, my red-scarfed girl. Don't get me wrong... Believe me, I'd wait a whole year. That's why I came. Will you take me up to the hill-top? Is that what they call love talk? You've come all the way from Istanbul... When I took his hand it was so warm, as if I had his heart in my hand. What will come out of such fooling around? Nothing! They taught us to be afraid of men. I'm not afraid of this one at all. No home, no household, no money! It obvious that he's from town, knows lots of girls... Why should he love me? Why do you try to spoil her marriage with another man? - What happened to that guy? - What guy? The guy you're going to marry, honey. Did you see him? I didn't. Today his father and relatives came. They are kin on my mother's side. Did they give you away? They did? I'm getting down here. - Are you angry? - Come on, get off. You won't come again, will you? You won't come again... Don't come. And don't be angry. I have no saying in this. Get off. Just look at me once more. Thank you. Ilyas, there's a job for you. You're going on a long trip today. They gave the Dam building job to Can. Out of the question! - Didn't you want to take long distance jobs? - I have to go to the Dam. What on earth is there at the Dam? For two days you haven't even done your job properly. I just don't want to take a long distance job. - I'm sorry, I can't change that. - You will change it! I told you I can't change it. I've invented a 1000 excuses to get you those jobs. So you invented excuses, eh? Will you switch the job with me? I'll give you 500 from my pocket. This Instanbuler has some "number" going on at the Dam. Tonight the balloon will burst, don't worry. See you, my friend. - What did he mean? - I don't owe anybody an explanation. Let's see if your "number" is pretty. Load your truck, here's your written order about where to unload. Ilyas! Wait, they'll throw you out. Ilyas... If I take you by the hand, will you come with me? I'm yours, take me away with you. Say "welcome" to my beloved, my friend. Welcome, my friend. Say welcome to my beloved, friends. Welcome, noble castle. Hey uncle farmer, say welcome to my beloved. Welcome, lonely tree, where is your beloved? Look here, little goats, say welcome to my beloved. Welcome, bearded goats. Hey sky, warm sun burning my face. Plentiful fields, brooks as merry as my heart. Welcome to you all. Hey, the Instanbuler is coming. I'll go and talk to the manager. You wait here? Will they throw you out? Who knows their whims, don't worry. This is the "number" from the Dam. Cocky Instanbuler. To give up Miss Dilek for that girl? I wouldn't exchange you for the world's most beautiful girl. Dirty bastard. May you all be cursed! No more looking aside for you, nephew. What did you plan about the wedding? I don't know, just let things get going. I have to go down to town. We have no house, no money. Don't worry about money. Our brother-in-law has a house in the village. We'll manage with a few household items. As for now, we'll celebrate a religious wedding. And don't forget to get the marriage licence later. Thank you, boss. The bride will stay with us until the wedding. Don't worry, she won't be lonely. Whenever I'm in trouble, you come to my help. And this is the bride. Welcome, girl. Welcome. What happened? I wasn't thrown out of work. My big friend took charge. The manager too behaved like a fine guy. He gave one week holiday. You're all invited to my wedding. I'll even bring Miss Dilek, don't worry. We had our wedding in the company's restaurant. It was very beautiful. We invited my parents too, but they didn't come. Mother sent the message "I have no daughter named Asya. May she be happy. " That Ilyas is really crazy. How can I know these dances? If I don't manage, will he be angry? Let him be angry, it's not my fault. The blond woman I saw first at the garage was called Dilek. What do I care! And I never liked the man she was dancing with. How can a wedding dress be so becoming on a bride? My cypress-like, red-scarfed girl. My woman, my Asya. "My Red-Scarfed Girl" The village was very beautiful. And your house was very beautiful. Everybody brought something. How happy it makes you to receive presents. I didn't buy any present. I took up my job with more enthousiasm. Sometimes I waited for him for days. It was never sure when he would return. But I knew he would come back to me. He was handsomer than all the other husbands. And he was mine. To drive back to the village to return to my wife gave me much excitement. She was so good to me. At first, I was ashamed to tell him. I'll be a father. I'm going to be a father. One feels strange. The day of the birth drew near. I wanted to give my Ilyas a son. I wanted him to love me all the more. I didn't want this trip. An emergency job had come-up. Only I could deliver the load on time. I feared I'd not be back in time for the birth. A heavy load and the road turning to mud. How could I know that this man was going to change my life? Young man, we are in trouble. Can you help us? No way! I'm in a hurry. The engine is wrecked. There 10 people in the bus. Rocks are falling on our heads. And even without them, we'll be frozen by morning. My load is heavy, and I must be on time. What's more important: Merchandise or lives? You can't take this road without a spare vehicle. There's no other way, will you pull us out? Will you force me to risk these people's lives? Even if there's a 1% chance? Look here, friend, my wife is all alone in the village. She's about to give birth. Don't these people here have children too? We'll manage, my friend, don't worry. Get in. You'll be crushed to death outside. When the road improves. Left! Turn left! Down there is an abyss. The ground has given way. Congratulations. You have a son. Ilyas will be happy. Look at the Instanbuler. Take the truck to the right. Careful. He drives at me on purpose. Bastard. See you. You've become a hero with your boss' truck. Do you know that man? He's one of our company's drivers. Isn't that the petrol station? You've done it, my friend. We've done it. You have a son. So that will be my son from now. Were you too that small when you were born? You too were that small. Me too? My son. Wait, don't hurry. What name shall we give him? Did you think of one? I didn't. Shall we call him Samet? Samet? So be it. Congratulations, nephew. Thanks. - May he grow up with his parents. - Thanks, uncle. Congratulations, master Ilyas. Congratulations. Thanks. Congratulations, big brother. Congratulations, a son is born. Thanks. I didn't want to give bad news on such a day, but... What's the matter again? You pulled a minibus below the Kanl? pass. Somebody must have told on me. You've been taken off the drivers group. You'll do repair work now. Repair work! They will take my red-scarfed girl from me next. Will I now have to wash everybody's truck? I'm leaving work. Don't be stupid. Think of your wife. And now there's a child too. If it weren't for them you could have done as you pleased. I beg you, don't do anything foolish. Is the manager inside? He has a visitor. Shall I tell him you're here? Think about your wife. There's a child too now. If it weren't for them you could have done as you pleased. We'll talk later. That night he came home at dawn for the first time. I knew it didn't go well at work. He was drunk. He looked at me that way for the first time. What's wrong? I wanted to share his worries. He couldn't tell. He didn't even love Samet. If it had been someone's fault, it must have been mine. I didn't understand, what could a baby's fault be who was as small as a hand? In fact, they'd taken his truck away from him. He couldn't be separated from his truck, he was like his friend, his child. Why don't you go and talk to them, girl? - With the manager? - Yes. How else shall he know the true consequences behind all this? He didn't do it just for fun. He saved the lives of so many people. You'll go with Ali. I'll watch the baby. I knew it was a good idea, but I didn't know if it was right. What had been his fault? This is no job for a woman. Won't Ilyas be angry? It's for your own good, girl. Is there another way? One month had passed. He never used to touch alcohol. Now he was drunk every night. He didn't speak, he didn't eat. He didn't even love his child. Don't wait in vain, Granny. I can't take you with me now. I'm no granny! Well, what are you? Did you send your wife to the manager? What rubbish are you talking! They say the Instanbuler has sent his beautiful wife to the manager. Who said this lie? Can? Your wife is now with the manager. Look for yourself. What happened? It seems the truck was more important than so many men's lives. Ilyas! I brought her here. You are not going to hit her while I'm around. Don't meddle with my affairs. Don't meddle. The Instanbuler is a womanish coward. Let them sort it out by themselves. Say it again. Say it again, buddy. The Instanbuler is a womanish coward. Am I lying? Didn't you send your wife? Get up, Pal. Get up, dog. Let me hear you say it again. Let go of me. Let go I say. No one among you is his friend. Am I lying, friend? Let go of me. - Didn't you send your wife? - Don't run away, dog. - May God protect me against the Instanbuler. Womanish coward. That night he didn't come home at all. The next night he didn't come either. It was my fault. All we did was waiting. She's just a dumb village girl. I told myself she wouldn't understand my sorrow. I couldn't stand my son anymore. I was all alone. I kept hearing Dilek's voice: "If it weren't for them you could do what you wanted". If it weren't for them... Asya, Samet. But there was one place where I could openly show my sorrow, curse freely and stay for a while: Dilek's house. I was alone and without any solution. I took shelter with her. We waited for months. We thought he would finally return to us. He was our husband, our father, our everything. There he was, with the red head-scarf. I knew he'd finally return to us. I just passed by to ask for news. You wait in vain, woman. Your Istanbuler is finally staying with Dilek. That night I couldn't sleep. That pig had told me a lie. I knew. He was my Ilyas. Even if I saw it with my own eyes I wouldn't believe. What's on your mind? Nothing. Ilyas. - Your wife came. - What? She was here. I saw her from the kitchen window. She is your wife. And you have a child too. I have loved you too, but... My red-scarfed girl. My Asya. I never loved anybody but you. Where to, woman? Well, to... That place... We'll take the turn at De?irmendere. Very well. You'll get up in the back, I have a sick man beside me. Give me your child. Take my hand. I'll get up myself. Sit in that corner, so that the child won't be cold. Alright. What a beautiful woman. Where may she be going with such a small baby? Where can we go now? With whom can we take shelter? She surely has a sorrow in her heart. The little one is crying because he's cold. Give him to me. He's only crying because he's cold, don't worry. I had two children of my own. He talks as if they are now dead. May God protect us. If anything happens to Samet I'll die. He fell asleep once he'd found a warm place. Is it a son? He looks like a good man. Would he be looking for us now? Damned bastard. Swine-sperm! What did you come for? Get out of our house. You put shame on us, you made us a laughing-stock, get out of our house! Pig, get lost! Leave it, mother. Why didn't you bring my sister? We've arrived, woman. Where are we? This is De?irmendere. We'll take the turn to the river. You get down first, I'll give him to you. This is the village you were going to, isn't it? That's right. How are you, brother? I'm fine, boss. Shall I bring some tea? Thanks, I'll have one glass of water. OK. Two strong tea for us, and bring a glass of water to the car. - I can't get that woman out of my mind. - She surely is beautiful. That has nothing to do with it. It seems to me she doesn't have a place to go. Why is my heart beating all of a sudden? You didn't drink your tea, brother. Don't misunderstand me, madam. You don't have a place to go. The weather is changing for the worse. Where can you go to in that freezing cold? Stay with us for the night. And go wherever you want to tomorrow. Think about your baby, woman. What else can I do? May God help me. Is nobody else here? Don't worry. I'll stay in the room outside. Close the door, the baby will be cold. Make yourself comfortable. If only my Ilyas were here... My little one, all alone and out of luck with fate. There is food in the cupboard. I'm not hungry. And milk too. Don't be afraid. No one will disturb you here. My name is Cemsit. I'm a road construction foreman. You can trust me, woman. Put some logs in the fire before you go to bed. Good night. Did we do wrong to come here, my Samet? What else could we have done? The child is sick. He didn't sleep the whole night, sir. He's is burning with fever. I'm coming. Well sweetie. So you have fallen ill? He's caught a cold, he has a fever. Come to me. What can we do, sir? What can we do for my Samet? Don't worry. The child can take it. I'll fetch a doctor. I'll be back tonight. Where is your father, Samet? Where is my Ilyas? Don't cry. Uncle Cemsit will fetch a doctor. And tomorrow we'll return to your father. Don't cry. This way please, doctor. - How is he? - The little one is not himself. The fever subside in a little while. - Will you be able to find someone to give injections around here? - I'll do it myself. I'll leave some medicine. You must take care of him for a week. And don't take him outside. We can't stay here. The lady is a close relative. She was returning to her village tomorrow... The baby's life is more important now. It can turn to pneumonia at any time. Don't worry. We can't stay. How can we stay? I'll be able to be with Samet for another week. How I've missed a child's voice. After that they'll leave... He's a good man. What could I have done, with a baby as small as a hand. Ilyas has become crazy now. Miss Dilek... I've never kissed my husband on his chest. Look here, my strong lad, open your mouth. Take it, my lion. My life. My darling. What if we didn't give him the injection? Hold him tight. Darling. He's laughing. He's laughing. My life. Where did you find these things? I bought them in town today. And this is for you. I hope you forgive me. I heard Samet's voice from outside. I had little sleep the past few nights, I must have overslept. I saw the door was open, and he's been crying. Here you go. To your mothers arms. The fever has gone down. Tomorrow there will be nothing left. The tea is ready. I'll be going out in a little while. It's time for us to leave you. But Samet isn't well yet. We must go. We won't trouble you. We'll just depart. You'll catch cold. I'll stop a car for you. He didn't stop. Nothing doing. The cars are passing very fast. I couldn't catch a driver's eye. One car had a broken window, Samet would have caught cold. And most cars didn't even stop. I didn't want you to go away so soon. You want to return home, don't you? You love your husband, don't you? Can't you stay till tomorrow? Alright. I thought I would never look at another woman. She would leave tomorrow, return to her beloved husband. I prepared some food, will you eat with us? At the time, we were constructing a great bridge in the east... When I heard the news about the earthquake, I rushed like a madman to my home town. Our house was just a heap of rubble. I lost my two children and my wife. At first I thought I'd die with grief. But one can be saved by working, I built roads, opened tunnels, made great new bridges. But somehow I couldn't get the past out of my mind. I had been cut off from life somehow. Samet and you have reconnected me with life, Asya. Asya. - So you went back? - I was a fool. Has he forgiven? Ilyas has left, Asya. With whom did he leave? - He's looked for you everywhere. - With whom did he leave? The guy has gone completely crazy. With whom? You are right, he's not a guy to be married to. But you know he loves you. With whom, uncle? He left with Miss Dilek. He'll come back in a few days. Will you be going back to your parents? Look here, stay with us for a few days. Thank you, uncle. Womanish coward from Istanbul. Asya. If you had found him, I'd have left without looking back. Where to, Asya? I don't want to be a burden to you. I'll move to town and find work. I can find work for you, if you like. At that time, I found work for Asya at the Sarid?z? Carpet Weaving Cooperative. Everyday, after work, I'd watch the trucks. Hoping to see Ilyas. I couldn't forget him. Still I felt love for him, and still I waited. I too waited... for the day she would return my love. Where was Ilyas? Was he still with that woman? I hope they haven't had any children by now. I told myself he would come one day. My love would bring him, he'd return to us. She was still waiting for him. I wished she would wait for me after my working day. I knew he loved us. He was sad. What could I do? Sometimes I told myself we ought to leave. But I was afraid to start a new life. On a snowy hilltop lots of meadows, meadows... I climbed those rainy hills... He was an affectionate man. He gave me confidence. Slowly I started to forget my bitter-sweet memories. What's this? A swing. But Samet is too young, how can he play on it? He'll play on it when he gets older. Samet will get older... He'll play on the swing. It's as if Cemsit had planned our future. We were going to stay here forever. But as what? Guest? Lodger? I thought for the first time how I would present Cemsit to Samet. Uncle Cemsit? A relative? Samit will get older. Samet will play on the swing. Samet will ask questions of his mother. She's still waiting for him. I've waited for you. You were late, and we were worried. Time passed. Samet grew up and could play on the swing. Mummy, come here. Let's swing together. Father made this for you. Daddy, Mummy. My son. Samet said Father to him. He chose Cemsit as his father. Will you, Asya Meran, take Cemsit Kira?, son of Mansur, as your lawful husband? I will. Will you, Cemsit Kira?, take Asya Meram, daughter of Ali, as your lawful wife? I will. At the wedding, my heart didn't beat that much. Was it because it was only an official marriage ceremony? I didn't think she would say yes. Was she able to forget her first husband? It counted as my first marriage. I was very sad. Is this happiness? I didn't know what happiness was. At some time there was him. Him I loved. Was that love? What is love? A friendly flowing brook, leaves rustling in the autumn wind, raindrops beating against the window. A heart-beat. After all, even a friendly brook stops flowing. Leaves dry and fall down. Rain stops, the sun comes out. What was love? Love, that was the claim of ownership of each other... a good friend's warm hand a human effort. Love, that was goodness. Love, that was human labour. On the snowy hilltop, meadows, meadows,... I climbed the rainy hilltop, oy meadows... They said my baby was sleeping, oy meadows... Let him sleep, I kiss the meadows... There was an accident, can you help us, sir? You put Samet to bed. I'll be back soon. That guy has been hit hard on the head. The truck... What's happened to the truck? No big damage. Forget about the truck and thank God that you're alive. You take care of the truck. Boil some water. There is hot water. And throw some logs on the fire. - Didn't you recognize me? - Of course I did, my hero. I've changed a lot, haven't I? I didn't touch drink at the time. What shall I do now? What shall I do? Wait, I'll take off that jacket. This friend is a driver, Asya. His truck has had an accident. After a rest he'll be alright. Bring some iodine and cotton, Asya. If I had known he was her first husband, would I have brought him here? I would. He was injured. Why did he come here? By God, what shall I do now? What shall I do? Bring some water, Asya. Let me clean the wound first. Clench your teeth, my friend. Does one drive a truck when being drunk? Though you're my guest, this shall hurt a lot. Asya, pass the iodine. Alright, that's it. You just sit there, I'll make your bed. I'm fine. I'll go. This night we won't let you go anywhere. Who is that uncle, mother? Samet! I can't stand it. I can't stand it. Uncle, where did you come from? From far away, my son. What's happened to your head? Did they beat you up? - Don't you have a gun? - I left it at home. - Will you show it to me tomorrow? - I'll show you. What's your name? Ilyas. Are you a friend of my father? He's your father, my child. My son. Daddy. Prepare our guest's bed, Asya. - Your son? - Yes. Your mustache is tickling me, daddy. My son. My red-scarfed girl near me, and I can't touch her. I felt like crying, but I couldn't cry. When you go to bed, leave your shirt. Asya will wash it. Good night. Uncle Ilyas, don't leave early, ok? Who am I in this house? What am I? Look me in the eyes, beloved. I have missed you so much. Look me in the eyes. I was afraid. It meant that I still loved him. That I hadn't forgotten him. Samet is their son. Asya still loves him. If they wanted to leave, would I be able to prevent it? If they would be happy... What was love? Who was my beloved? Who gave us shelter and warmth? I didn't know who had the father's rights. I was afraid. My Samet should not suffer. Asya. I left everything and came, Asya. I came because of you, because of Samet. Can you forgive me? Take my hand again, Asya. Good morning. How are you? Fine, thanks. Last night there was ice. I have to heat the motor. Will you be able to start the truck? We'll try. Asya, tell us when the water's hot. We'll carry it. Let's go. Mummy... Where is uncle Ilyas, mother? They went to the truck, my son. Please take me there, mother. Pour some hot water, it'll be alright. Thanks. Uncle Ilyas. Uncle Ilyas. Put me in the truck. Up you go. Samet, let's go home. Take the child, jump up and let's go, Asya. Isn't Samet my son? Aren't you my red-scarfed girl? Don't forget to bring your gun, uncle. Samet. Go outside an play for a while. This is your gun. - Shall I take you for a ride in the truck? - Let's go. May God help me. I'll be a driver when I'm older. Look what uncle Ilyas has brought me. - How did it go? - Alright. I brought a present for Samet. Stay with us for supper. I don't have time. As you like. - See you. - Bye bye. Hands up, daddy. Hands up, mummy. Look here, put it away and eat your supper. Isn't it a pity if you would kill a man with it? But uncle Ilyas gave it to me. We got in the truck today. He gave his word. He'll bring me a truck too, father. A huge truck. Mother... Uncle Ilyas should come to us all the time. Eat your supper, son. Uncle Ilyas has come. Not today, my son. I want to see uncle Ilyas, mother. Not today I said, my child. You are not well. But I'm not sick, mother. Out of the question! Please don't go. I beg you, don't go. Don't go. I beg you. Don't go. Don't go. Will she leave me and go? Asya is my wife. How can I go? For so many years he gave us shelter and warmth. What will Samet do, what will I do? Samet. Uncle Ilyas. But I can't ride that one. If you want we can ride my truck. - Where is your truck? - I left him down on the road. If your mother had heard it, she wouldn't have let you go. Mother doesn't let me. I cried a lot. Mother cried too. You are sad too, uncle Ilyas. Will you take me up the truck? Tell me, will you take me up the truck? If you want, you can stay with me always. We'll both sleep in the truck. I'll always drive you around. Maybe your mother will drive with us too, ok? OK. Samet. Samet. She still loves me. I saw it in her eyes. If Samet comes, she'll come too. My son, my red-scarfed girl. Faster, uncle Ilyas, faster. I'm a driver, uncle Ilyas. The lion driver Samet is coming. Let's take father too. Dad. Samet! Samet, my son. Wait. I want to go to father, stop the truck. I want Dad. Well, look here... my son. I want Dad. Samet. Don't cry Samet, don't cry, my child. I'll take you back. Please don't cry. But first I must tell you this. I'm your... Samet! Mummy. Father. My Asya, my red-scarfed girl. Samet said father. He chose him as a father. What was love? Love was goodness, friendship. Love was human labour. Asya. If I stayed I wouldn't be able to save myself again. No problem. Her smile is enough for us. Is it a sin if my heart is slipping? If I get stuck in the mud again, will you come and help me? When I took his hand it was so warm. As if I had his heart in my hand. If I took you by the hand, would you come with me? I'm yours. Take me with you. Farewell, Asya. Farewell my girl, tall like a Cyprus and wearing a red scarf. Farewell, my unfinished song. THE END
