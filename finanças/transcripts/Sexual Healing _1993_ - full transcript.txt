[MUSIC PLAYING] Listen, Marlin, there's something I want to talk to you about. Sure. What is it? I think we should start to explore things. Explore? Yeah, you know, like take this to the next step. You mean-- David, you are amazing person, and I really want you in my life. Yeah? But I don't-- I'm not attracted to you in that way. What do you mean? You're like a brother to me, a best friend. I would never want to screw that up. I got to go. [MUSIC - MARVIN GAYE, "SEXUAL HEALING"] Oh, baby, let's get down tonight. Oh, baby. I'm hot just like an oven. I need some lovin'. Baby, I can't hold it much longer. It's getting stronger and stronger. When I get that feeling, I want sexual healing. Sexual healing. Oh, baby. Makes me feel so fine. Helps me relieve my mind. Sexual healing, baby. It's good for me. Sexual healing, it's something that's good for me. Whenever blue teardrops are fallin' and my emotional stability is leaving me, there is something I can do. I can get on the telephone and call you up, baby. Please. Please open up. Some painters are coming by today to look at the playroom. I'm reading this book that blue fosters creativity. That's fine. But it said that red was calming and tranquil, good for the digestion. That's fine. Listen, why don't we just put up a big picture of you. Then we don't have to paint at all, OK? [KNOCK ON DOOR] David? I just got home. I spent the night at Tim's. I just got your message. David, come on. I know you're in there. I did exactly what you said, Suzanne, and I got the same old shit. Only this time I wandered around like a goddamn zombie, ended up at a strip joint. Was it a good show? I didn't go in, for Christ's sake. I don't know, David. You're a great guy and you're great looking, but somehow you just keep repeating this pattern. I'm repeating it? This is my fault? No, it's not your fault, but it's like some part of you must have shut down or something. Do we have to analyze this, because if we do, then I need another pint. OK, you're right. Sorry. Maybe you should just crash all day. And then come dancing with us later, OK? I don't dance. You know I don't dance. Oh. Well, maybe you should try, you know? You know what I should try? I should try Bambi. OK, good idea. Try Bambi. She's only $2 a minute. Why bother with a relationship at all? OK, here's how it works. Hundreds of women call this line and listen to messages from all you hot men. Then they dial your number for an erotic encounter. At the tone, you'll have 20 seconds to leave a message. Then you can review it and rerecord if necessary. Good luck. Hi, my name is Jim, and I'm an English teacher. And I've never done this before, but well, it's sort of-- I'm lying here on my bed. I'm wearing nothing at all. I'm thinking about you and it's making me hot. I've got seven inches of-- [LAUGHS] I treat my lover like a flower. I approach her softly, stroke her tenderly. Are there really any women out there who are into this? It's kind of weird, huh? Scary. We'll just see what happens. Jim. 312-575-4845. Leaving the San Fernando Valley, as we just [INAUDIBLE] down here by way of the Hollywood Freeway. Southbound 170 portion of the Hollywood Freeway still flooded from Magnolia across the Ventura Freeway-- [PHONE RINGING] This is 575-4845. Leave a message. Hi, I was calling for Jim. Hi, this is Jim. [PHONE RINGING] Hello? I'm sorry. I'm sorry I hung up. No, no, it's OK. It's OK. What's your name? Renee. Renee, that's pretty. I don't know if I can actually do this. You've never done this before? No. Oh my god, no. Well, guess what? I haven't, either. Really? Oh, I like that. I feel better already. Where are you calling from, Renee? Santa Ana. How about you? Venice. Venice? You mean like where the roller skaters are and stuff? Yeah, yeah. It's just a couple of blocks from here. I used to skate all the time. I loved it. My husband stopped taking me. You're married? Oh my god, I shouldn't have told you that. I'm sorry. Do you want me to just hang up? No, no, no, no, no. It's OK. I mean, I just hadn't really thought of-- I mean, this isn't the same as-- is it? I don't know. I don't think so. I'd be too scared to do that. I'm so nervous now, I don't even know what I'm saying. I know. I know. It's like we're people, right? Just talking and how we get together stuff. I don't know. Wait a minute, I got an idea. Why don't we just hang up and you'll call me back. OK? You call coming right back and we'll just start right out in the other way. You're perfect. Really, you're being so sweet. You have to call me back. You have to swear. I swear. [GIGGLES] OK. When you call back, ask for David. My real name's David. [PHONE RINGING] Hello? Grandma, hi. Look, I can't really talk right now. No, no, no. Nothing's wrong, I'm just really late for school. Yeah, can I call you back tonight? After Jeopardy, OK. All right, bye bye. [PHONE RINGING] Hello? Hi, it's Renee. You have a very sexy voice, Renee. What do you look like? I'm 5'7", blonde hair, and hazel eyes. That's beautiful. What about your body? It's normal. I mean, it's nice, I guess. Right. I'm 6'1". I got brown eyes, brown hair, and right now I'm lying on my couch and I'm totally naked. I am, too. Now, I want you to imagine that you're on vacation. It's a hot, humid night. And your husband, he's gone down to the bar for a drink. Just as you're about to drift off to sleep, I appear. I kneel down beside you on the bed. You can feel my breath on your neck, my lips on your lips as we kiss, the back of my hand as it slowly travels down the length of your body. Gently, I spread your legs wide open. I want you so badly. I lick my way up the inside of your thigh and circle you, part you, taste you. You clamp your legs around my head and just pull me in tighter. You reach down with your hand and you stroke me. As I lick, you stroke. Slowly at first, but then faster and harder. Then I pull away and I glide up your body. I stare into your eyes and enter you. This time we're inside each other melting to the rhythm. In and out. In and out. In and out. Oh. [SEXUAL NOISES] I'm glad you don't have call waiting. [LAUGHS] What's the most beautiful place you've ever seen? Yosemite. I was nine. The best meal you've ever eaten? Kraft macaroni and cheese, tater tots, and orange soda. Oh. No, no, no, no, no. You don't understand. Whenever I'm depressed, it's like-- it's like mom or something. No, I get it. Mine is fishsticks or Haagen-Dazs. Oh, god. Best sex? Pass. No passes. No, pass. Do you remember the other day when I passed? It was because-- I don't know how I can say this- I don't know if I've ever had good sex. You're 32 years old. I've never been with anyone besides Frank. You want to know the best sex I ever had? OK. With you. Oh come off it. No, I'm serious. Well, that's ridiculous. You should just get out there more. Just be the guy who talks to me. What if it's about you? How could it be? You don't even know what I look like. Well, maybe we should exchange pictures. Are you still there? Barely. Have you thought any more about the pictures? I'm scared, David. I want to, but I'm scared. Don't you think I'm scared? I mean, your husband could hunt me down and kill me. But that's why my plan is so safe. It's not that. It's just starting to feel so real. [MUSIC PLAYING] Can you talk? David, are you OK? No, I'm not. I just got back-- I shouldn't be telling you this. Telling me what? Hey, look, you know how you were saying that this was starting to feel so real. Well, real is supposed to be what I want, right? But there's something-- there's something inside. I just can't-- I ended up at this sleazy club with dancers. You mean like strippers? Yeah. And one of them, I guess she was a-- she said for 100 bucks, she'd-- oh my God, what was I doing? Did you have some kind of sex, is that it? It wasn't, you know, sex exactly. What difference does it make? David, I'm not sure, but I think I know how you feel. Oh, yeah, yeah. I'm sure this happens to you all the time. No, no, no, no. That's not what I'm saying. I mean, I don't know, but I think you had a freak out, David, and I think it makes sense. It's not bad or anything. No? No. What should we do? I have an idea. Hello? Do you have it? I have it. When you're ready. I'm ready. [INAUDIBLE] I'm ready. 1, 2. You have very sexy handwriting, by the way. And 3. You're beautiful. No, I think you're beautiful. No, you are. No, really, you are. [LAUGHS] [MUSIC - LEONARD COHEN, "WHO BY FIRE"] And who by fire, blue by water, who in the sunshine, who in the nighttime. Who by high ordeal, who by common trial. Who in your merry, merry month of May. Who by very slow decay. And who shall I say is calling? And who in her lonely slip, who by barbiturate. Who in these realms of love, who by something blunt. Who by avalanche, who by powder. Who for his greed, who for his hunger. And who shall I say is calling? Who by brave assent, who by accident. Who in solitude, who in this mirror. Who by his lady's command, who by his own hand. Who in mortal chains, who in power. And who shall I say is calling? You're not having lunch with me? I can't, Holly, I'm sorry. I have to run this errand. So I'll run it with you. Oh, no, no, no. That's all right. That's all right. We'll do it tomorrow. Just a minute. I know what's going on here. There is no Aaron. You're having an affair. No, I'm not. Yes, you are. It's written all over your face. Holly. Holly, I'm not having an affair. Wait, wait, wait. What exactly do you consider an affair? An affair, my darling, is when a man and a woman get together, at least one of them married, and exchanged sexual favors. Right. I'm not having an affair. David, you ruined me. It's all I think about on the freeway and at work. You wouldn't believe the stuff that pops into my mind. Well, good, you're making up for lost time. It's scary, though. I mean, look at us. Do you think what we do is normal? Well, it's safe, that's for sure. These phone lines are booming. Yeah, but do other people have a whole relationship? Whole relationship? I like the way that sounds. I'm sorry. I slept through the alarm. You all right? Yeah, I'm fine. Why? I don't know. You're acting kind of different lately. Different? What do you mean? I've never seen you quite so moony before. David, are you there? Pick up. I'm here. What's wrong? I think Frank suspects something. Why? What happened? It doesn't even matter. I don't even care. And then I do care, and I'm just mad that he doesn't. How do you know he doesn't? Because he's turned into a zombie. It's like he can't even deal with me. It's like he has no idea what I need. Do you tell him in a way that he can hear? What does that mean? Real calm, real direct, asking for specific things. He doesn't listen. He's not like you. All he would do is look at me like I was out of my mind. All right, all right, I was just asking. Directory assistance. This is Jessica. The number you have reached. 3-9. It's for you. Jamie. I got one pepperoni and one mushroom. Hi, you've reached-- [INTERPOSING VOICES] Come in and file a report. No, I won't. Excuse me, I didn't have the affair. I'm calling with the results of your HIV test. There's nobody here by that name. [PHONE RINGING] Let's take another call. Remember when we were talking about my pattern with women and how I should get out more? Well, I'm finally ready. Really? Good. Great. Which is why I think the two of us should meet. David, that's not really-- Why not? Well, because, David, you know how I feel about you, but I have a life. You know, I have a husband, a daughter. A husband who barely speaks to you, let alone loves you. OK, wait a minute, OK? He does love me. And do you love him? Yes. No. Yes. Yes, I do. I mean, I love-- I love who he was before. That's enough for you? You're willing to settle for that? I don't know. I don't understand why you're pushing this now. Let's just enjoy this, can't we, for a while? What's a while? Give me some time, OK, and I promise I'll do, you know, what I've been chicken to do so far. The talking? Uh-huh. And I'll get drunk or something, whatever it takes, and I'll do the whole fantasy myself. You won't have to say a single thing. It's not about that. You know, it's beyond that. I know, but I want to do it, for you and for me, OK? [MUSIC PLAYING] [VOCALIZING] Hello? Hi, it's me. Well, you ready to go? I'm as ready as I'll ever be. You have to promise you won't laugh, and that if I make a mistake, I can start over. Uh-huh. And if you don't like it, you have to lie and say it was the most amazing thing you've ever had in your life. OK, calm down. OK, OK. I'm calm. OK, here it goes. It's the senior prom at the school where you teach. Uh-huh. All the kids are in like tuxedos and gowns. You're the chaperone, surrounded by adoring girls. Underneath your table is a trap door, and I climb out of it, totally naked. No one can see me because of the long tablecloth. Slowly, carefully, I slither through this maze of pumps. I spread your legs, unzip your pants. It's all been arranged. You've been expecting me. You know, you have to keep up a conversation, keep a straight face. As I take you in my hands, I open my mouth, and plunge my wet lips-- oh my god, Mike's home. Oh my god, what do I do? Renee, don't panic. Listen to me. Don't hang up. Go in the bathroom and lock the door. Renee, you home? Ren? What's going on? Where are you? I'm in here. How come you're home so early? He sent us home early. Why is the door locked? I don't feel good. I just threw up. Flush the toilet. Why are you drinking? You don't drink. I thought it would make me feel better. Is someone else here? No. Come out of there. I want to talk to you. I've got to go. I'll call you back. No, Renee, don't hang up on me now. [KNOCK ON DOOR] David, are you conscious? Who's that? Not now, Suzanne. No one, just my neighbor. I just need my book. I left it in here. Your neighbor? I told you about her. She lives downstairs. Suzanne, this is not a good time. [INAUDIBLE] late for work. If she's just a neighbor, then why did she barge right in? All tangled up in the sheets. What is going on? You begged me to stay on the phone and then some woman hops into your bed? What is the big deal? Who are you talking to? Goodbye, Suzanne. There, she's gone. Fabulous. I don't know what you're so freaked out about. I mean, you're the one with the husband in the next room. I told you about him. Well, there is nothing to tell, for Christ's sake. Renee, please, this is ridiculous. Hey, I love you. Do you love me, too? David. We have to meet. I know where you work. I peeled off the sticker. I have to go. Goodbye. I'm lonely, Frank. I buy lingerie to feel beautiful. I make up stories to feel wanted. Are you sleeping with someone? No, not even my husband. Are you sure you're not sleeping with someone? The way things have gotten around here, would it surprise you if I were? What about the family? Well, what about it? [BEEP] David, are you there? It's second period already. Why haven't you called in? Do you still want this job or what? [MUSIC PLAYING] What floor? You got it. Thanks. What? We're almost there. We're almost there. I, uh-- they said I was coming in early. I know it's your lunch hour. So I was wondering if you want to go on a picnic? A picnic? If you want to. I mean, it's just an idea. No, no. You got to start somewhere. [CLEARING THROAT] I'll go. I'd like to go. But there are things I need from you, Frank. Real things, specific things. OK. Let's talk. Let's talk about them. Yeah? Yeah. [CLEARING THROAT] I'll be right back. OK. [MUSIC - CHAKA KHAN, "SWEET THING"] I will love you anyway, even if you cannot stay. I think you are the one for me. Here is where you ought to be. I just want to satisfy you, though you're not mine. I can't deny you. Don't you hear me talking, baby? Love me now or I'll go crazy. Oh, sweet thing. Don' you know you're my everything? Oh, sweet thing. Don't you know you're my everything? I wish you were my lover, but you act so undercover. To love you child my whole life long, be it right or be it wrong. I'm only what you make of me, baby. Don't walk away. Don't be so shady. Don't want your mind. Don't want your money. These words I say, they may sound funny, but. Oh, sweet thing. Don't you know you're my everything? Oh, sweet thing. Don't you know you're my everything? Yes, you are. Yes, you are. [VOCALIZING] You are my heat. You are my fire. You are my weak with strong desire. To love you child my whole life long, be it right or be it wrong. I just want to satisfy you, though you're not mine. I can't deny you. Don't you hear me talking, baby? Love me now or I'll go crazy. [VOCALIZING] You're the heat. You are the fire. You're not mine. I can't deny you. Don't you hear me talking, baby? Love me now or I'll go crazy. You're the heat. You are the fire. You're not mine. I can't deny you. Don't you hear me talking, baby? Love me now or I'll go crazy. You're the heat. You're the fire. You're not mine. I can't deny you. Don't you hear me talking, baby? Love me now or I'll go crazy. You're the heat. You are the fire. [MUSIC - MARVIN GAYE, "SEXUAL HEALING"] Oh, baby now let's get down tonight. Oh, baby. I'm hot just like an oven. I need some lovin'. And baby, I can't hold it much longer. It's getting stronger and stronger. When I get that feeling, I want sexual healing. Sexual healing, oh, baby. Makes me feel so fine. Helps to relieve my mind. Sexual healing, baby, is good for me. Sexual healing is something that's good for me. Whenever blue teardrops are fallin', and my emotional stability is leaving me. There is something I can do. I can get on the telephone and call you up, baby. And honey, I know you'll be there to relieve me. The love you give to me will free me. If you don't know the thing you're dealing, oh, I can tell you, darling, that it's sexual healing. Let's make love tonight. Wake up, wake up, wake up. On certain streets in Southern California, it's not unusual to see a van like this with people like this working out of it-- electricians wiring, gaffers gaffing, stars going over their lines, or maybe just talking to their agents. David, you know how I feel about you, but I have a life. On this particular set, it's all happening, but with a difference. Here, everyone's putting in their time, and overtime, for free. We're giving them professional shots for nothing. I don't know. I think they ought to double my pay, actually. The film is Sexual Healing, an independent production that would otherwise be called low budget. In this case, it's no budget. The movie is being shot as a benefit for AIDS charities, and is the brainchild of writer/director Howard Cushnir. Whoever we started talking to, whether it was a lab or a caterer or an equipment house or a crew, and cast as well, we'd say, we're making a short film. And they'd say, oh, big deal. Dime a dozen. And then we'd say, it's a benefit for AIDS charities. And they'd say, really? How can we help? Among those who did help is a core of acting talent that one could rightfully call high priced. Helen Hunt from Mr. Saturday Night and TV's Mad About You, Anthony Edwards from Top Gun and Northern Exposure, and Seinfeld's neurotic sidekick, Jason Alexander. I got a phone call from Howard. Jason, how would you like to do this movie? Small role. No money. And of course, I jumped on it. I mean, those are the conditions I like to work under whenever I possibly can. Sexual Healing is the story of David, a romantically frustrated bachelor, and Renee, a woman trapped in a loveless marriage, who attempt to make a connection through the convenient and increasingly popular avenue of phone sex. Right now I'm lying on my couch, totally naked. I am, too. This is a safe thing because it's only on the phone. In fact, there's a scene in the movie where she asks her friend, what exactly is an affair? An affair, my darling, is when a man and a woman get together, at least one of them married, and exchange sexual favors. Right. I'm not having an affair. Through the magic of this phone line, she can have an adventure, and then the adventure becomes sexual, and then it becomes loving. That's, I think, the journey that it takes. Already a multimillion dollar industry in America, phone sex, according to the filmmakers, appeals to our desires for both intimacy and isolation. It also serves as an appropriate backdrop for a film dedicated to combating AIDS. The single most difficult and prevalent aspect of sexuality in the age of AIDS is fear. People have equated fear with sex, sex with death. And something that for a lot of people was fun and interesting and thrilling, and all of that, became dangerous and dark and just fraught with all kinds of problems. So phone sex, if nothing else, is the safest sex imaginable. You're beautiful. No, I think you're beautiful. No, you are. No, really, you are. [LAUGHS] I don't think that phone sex will be the wave of the future for our relationships or intimacy with people. I think it happens to be the thing of the late '80s, early '90s, like the pet rock of intimacy. It's a clever trick that someone thought up to play off of everybody's fear in relation to getting to know someone or having a sexual relationship with someone. If the '90s are producing relationships as unnaturally distant as this one, they are also producing some benefits. As horrible as the AIDS epidemic is, it's done a couple of things that, in certain people's minds, are very positive. It's done wonders for monogamous relationships. It's really made people reassess their sexual values, their sexual morals, their sexual activity. And there's a lot more relationships happening, as opposed to couplings. And in a town notorious for its inflated salaries and inflated egos, the crisis has also brought out some very positive impulses. I'm very impressed with this group of people. My face will be out there, so in that sense, professionally, I get that out of it. But these people are donating their time because they feel like it's a good thing to do, and I find that pretty remarkable. Sexual Healing, premiering July 18th, exclusively on Showtime. Back in the early '90s, I had written and rewritten a number of scripts, and I was at that point in my career where I wanted to become a director as well. And I also knew that there was no reason anyone should believe that I could do that, and so I set out to do what many people in that position do, which is make a short film. And I wanted to choose a subject matter that really lent itself to that length, and that also created a challenge for me to overcome. Now, the world of phone sex was really interesting back then. There wasn't computers and Skype and chat rooms and cyber this and that. Really, it was all about individuals being able to hook up with other individuals, not professionals. And it created a tremendous amount of intimacy, on the one hand, because your phone receivers make you brain to brain, but at the same time, there's complete distance and anonymity. So that's what led me to the subject matter and the treatment of Sexual Healing. Also, what I wanted to do was create a real closeness, and I wanted the audience to really care about the relationship between these two characters who never meet in person until the very end of the film. And my hope was that producers and studios would say, wait a minute. This guy got us to care about two people who were never even in the same room, and so maybe we should give him a shot with people who actually are in the same room. And one interesting note about that is that when we shot the film, we use this special device so that we couldn't use actual phone lines, but we had the characters on phones, never in the same room. So as much as possible, we simulated the world of phone sex as it existed at that time. When you make a short film, basically everyone has to work for free, and you're pulling in every favor that you can and you're asking people to extend themselves on their own time, and I was a little uncomfortable with that. I wasn't such a good asker. And at the same time, I had a career previously as an activist for human rights and the environment. And so I came up with the idea of creating the film as a fundraiser for the Minority AIDS Project. And this was a little bit strange. It had never been done before. And there was a real good reason why it hadn't been done, and that is that there was no market, really, for short films. You could go on the festival circuit, of course, but you don't make any money doing that. So some people wondered, was it a trick, a gimmick, et cetera? But I had this feeling that if we pulled it off, somehow there would be a market for it and we would be able to raise money for the Minority AIDS Project. And so that's how I set it up, and we were off and running. In the early stages of preproduction, I had two actors who were working with me in the two lead roles. Both of them were friends of mine. Not really famous, but really high quality actors. And one of them, the male lead, I ended up having a big creative disagreement with. And he quit, or I fired him, or both. I'm not sure. And the other one decided to stay on, but we had to find a new male lead. And I racked my brain trying to think of who might be good for it. And I remembered that, from my activist days, I had a good connection with Anthony Edwards. So I asked him, and lo and behold, he read the script. He liked it. He said he would do it. So that was great. I was really excited at that point. And then right before we started shooting, my friend, the actress, got chicken pox and had to back out of the whole thing. So on the one hand, this was an emergency. We were all set to go. What were we going to do? But it turned out to be an opportunity, as well, because I remembered that one of Anthony Edward's best friends, who he'd known for years and years, was Helen Hunt. And I asked him, very tentatively, if he would ask her. He did. She loved the role and she agreed to do it. She was in between assignments and had just the right amount of time. The real motivation, to be honest, though, was that she and Tony had never worked together up until that time, and they saw it as their first chance to do so. So we also had Jason Alexander, who agreed just because he wanted to help out. So my little film went from being one that probably wouldn't have been noticed to having big stars in it, and that made a lot of things a lot easier as we were getting ready to shoot. The first challenge I had in working skillfully with actors on a set was when Helen came to me about one of the scenes that had her doing something pretty outlandish. She was going to climb up on a table and she was going to kind of make a fool of herself, in what I thought was right for the character. But she didn't. And she came to me right before we were all set up to shoot. And she said, I've been trying this 100 different ways, and I have a feeling that I'm going to commit myself on camera to something that I'm going to really regret, and I don't want to do it. So I had no idea what to do. Time was ticking. The clock and the money were rolling. And luckily, Jason Alexander stepped in and he said, you know, when in doubt, shtick. And that's the scene you'll see where there's a spit take, essentially. And it worked. It got us through that one point in the film. It's still the one I'm least proud of, because we had to think of it on the spot and it's not exactly true to the story or the character, but it's what we can do at the time. One other time during the course of the filming Helen and I had something we had to work through, and this time I felt like it was important to do it a little bit indirectly. So it's the scene when she's having phone sex with Tony's character, and her husband comes home. And she's really freaked out about this, but she's even more freaked out when Tony says to her, I know where you live. I peeled off the sticker. And he's referring to the return address that was on the envelope that she sent him that she had covered up with a sticker from her workplace. And I wanted Helen to have a really big response, because it seemed like he was almost threatening that he was going to break the agreement they had to keep their lives separate, which would have been really, really scary for her at that time, especially because she's already filled with adrenaline because her husband is just about to barge in on her. So I just wasn't getting the intensity that I hoped for in her response when he said that. And I didn't know what to do, and I talked to Tony about it at lunch. And he said, well, I have an idea that might help you, but you're going to be on your own. I don't know how Helen is going to react. And so what we worked out is that without telling Helen, that when we shot the scene in close-up, instead of saying the lines as scripted, Tony made them much more urgent and menacing. He said something like, I know where you live. I'm going to come there. And in the moment, Helen, great actress that she is, just completely jumped and gave the perfect reaction. And then the only thing left was to see was she going to be upset with me afterwards because of that manipulation? So we said cut and there was a pause, and I'm kind of sweating it out. She just turned, cool as a cucumber to Tony and said, great scene, Tony. And never spoke of it again, and I never checked up about it with her. So to this day, I don't know whether she knew what we did or if she was just so in it, it didn't even occur to her that anything was different. One of the final things we did on the film was the soundstage, the post-production, and the key pieces where the music-- there's a lot of music in this film. It was really important to me. And the song that had to be in there, as far as I was concerned, was "Sexual Healing," the Marvin Gaye song, title of our film, of course. And we had tried really hard to get the rights to the song and we hadn't heard back. It wasn't a no, we just didn't hear anything. And now there was no time left, and I knew someone who knew someone who knew someone who got in touch with EMI and said, what's going on? And what we found out was is that the estate of Marvin Gaye had given us the rights to the song weeks and weeks ago, but there was a co-writer who they couldn't find, and therefore they couldn't get his approval. So they said, the only way you can use the song is if you write a letter, little guy that you are, indemnifying multibillion dollar conglomerate EMI against any possible future claims from this co-writer. So I talked to my lawyer, while I was right there on the sound stage, and my lawyer said, don't do it. Don't do it. And I thought, whoever this guy is, if he ever turns up, he's got to know it's a benefit film. It's helping people, and he's not going to create a problem. So I decided to go for it, and 20 years later, I have never heard anything from he or his people, and if I ever do, I'm still hopeful and confident that everything will be fine. But that was probably the biggest risk that I had to take as a young filmmaker, just to protect the quality of what it was I was trying to create. In order to do the film with a very small budget, we decided half the money would go towards production and half the money would go towards post-production. But also, as somebody who was the writer, producer, director, and financer for the film, at some point I had to let go of some of the control. So on the first day of shooting, I gave my checkbook over to one of the line producers, and he was in charge. And after the second or third day of shooting, we sat down to see how things were going. And at that point I found out that he had spent the entire budget, not just the budget for production, but production and post-production as well. So I was a wreck. I didn't know what to do. And I was completely fried from just the directing responsibilities and couldn't get to sleep that night, and finally decided, OK, here's what we'll do. We'll finish the shoot and then we'll see if we can get donations of editing bays and everything else we needed to create a rough cut of the film that then we could market. So that's what we ended up having to do. We got to a good cut of the film and used temporary sound, nothing that we paid for, et cetera, and took it to the one place that was on the top of my list that I thought would want it, and that was Showtime. And Showtime took one look at the film, who was in it, the subject matter, and they said, yes, absolutely. We'll do it. So I was really thrilled that the whole idea was coming together, not just as a film, but as a benefit as well. And what Showtime and I worked out was that as a part of their deal with me, which was just going to recoup all of my costs-- so I wasn't making any money in the process-- but they would give a check for $25,000 directly to the Minority AIDS Project. So to this day, really proud that that got pulled off. We ended up giving more to the Minority AIDS Project later as more money came into the film, came to me through further distribution of the film, and that was the highlight. The low light, so to speak, regarding what happened to the film, this was right before it came out on Showtime. Now, it did great on Showtime. Got good ratings. It was nominated for Cable Ace Award. It won first prize at the Houston Film Festival. So I'm riding high. And in the process of riding high, I contacted somebody who I used to know who writes for the LA Times. And I said, would you be interested in doing a feature, not just on me as a young filmmaker, but on this benefit process that we created to do the film? Maybe because we used to be friends, he had to be extra skeptical in his writing. So he asked me this question. He said, how do you respond to the criticism that making a short film as a benefit for charity is just a big publicity stunt for your own interest? And I thought about that, and I said kind of off the cuff, well, if making a film that otherwise would have just been for me turned out also to raise money for people who really need it, then that is the greatest publicity stunt I ever could have thought of. I was a little bit naive to the way newspaper editing works. And the low light was just around the time that the film was premiering, the article came out, and they cut my quote so that it said something like, I figured out the greatest publicity stunt ever. And it sounded like I was self-aggrandizing and opportunistic and it really was all about me. So I was mortified, but I thought the article came out on a Saturday, it would go away and nobody would see it. Unfortunately, the people who saw it were the executives at the Screen Actors Guild. Why was this a problem? Well, that same line producer who spent all the money by the third day of production was supposed to get a waiver from SAG so that all these top-notch actors could do the film without getting in trouble. And I asked him about the waiver before we started shooting, and he said, it's all taken care of. Well, it turns out it was never taken care of. And at this point, especially because the article caused them to distrust me, SAG basically said, either you pay $40,000 for the salaries of all these actors, even though they agreed to work for free, or the film is non-union. My first thought was, OK, non-union. Sorry, we made a big mistake, but I didn't do it and I can't fix it because I don't have any money to give anybody. But then I found out that if the film was non-union, then the actors would all be in violation of rule one of the Screen Actors Guild, which is that you have to call and check and make sure that a film is kosher before you do it. So I told the actors what the problem was, and they were somewhat sympathetic, but also really irritated and frustrated, as makes sense. Their point of view was make it go away, but I couldn't make it go away. And so the true low light of all of this whole experience around Sexual Healing was that Anthony Edwards, Helen Hunt, Jason Alexander, Maggie Wheeler, and Mare Winningham all had to go before committees of their peers and be admonished at the Screen Actors Guild for breaking the rules. And it's no wonder that I haven't talked to most of those people ever since we made the film, and to this day, I really regret that all happened and that there wasn't a way that I could fix it. But what made it even stranger was that these people were famous before we started shooting, but got really famous after. This was just kind of luck of timing for me, because after we finished shooting Sexual Healing, Seinfeld took off, so Jason was a huge superstar. Mad About You came into being and Helen was a huge superstar. And then ER also premiered and Anthony Edwards took off, too. And that was the bizarre thing, is that these people had to take days off of work from those shows to come and explain this small, little independent short film and how they had gotten embroiled in the controversy. What most people don't know about the movie business is that for every person who takes that leap onto the A list, there are 10 or 50 or 100 people who came really close, but it just didn't happen for them. And that's the way it was for me. I had made this film. As I mentioned, it did really well, and I thought it was going to create an opportunity for me to become a writer/director and have the fabulous success in Hollywood that I always imagined, dreamed up for myself, and it just didn't come to be. And I tried and tried and banged my head against the wall and wrote more scripts like you're supposed to do, and I couldn't even get a job directing a cartoon, or writing one for that matter. So I was heartbroken and had to lick my wounds, and eventually I moved on to writing and co-designing a graphic adventure game, and a few other projects, up in Silicon Valley, when they were looking for Hollywood talent. And then from there, my life took a number of turns, and I ultimately became a personal growth and spiritual writer and teacher, which I am still to this day. Sometimes I have to remind people that I'm the same guy who made this film because I made it when I was using Howard as my first name. That was my given first name. But since then, I switched to my Hebrew middle name, which is Raphael. And so I go by Raphael Cushnir now, and that's not what's on the credits of the film, but I promise it's the same guy. But I have to be honest and say that I've written a couple of screenplays since then and the itch is still there, and I think of getting back into the business at one point or another. And every time I call my friends that I knew from back then in the '90s, they all say to me, why? Why would you ever want to do it? It's 100 times harder and 100 times worse than it was back then, and it was pretty hard back then. So I'm chastened by what they have to share, but honestly, I think once you've gotten the taste that I did, it never really does go away, and if there's ever a chance for me to do it again, I'll jump at that chance. So this is 20 years since I made this film, even though to me it seems just like yesterday. And it never came out, beyond just a few markets, to the general public once its short run on Showtime ended. And that's because of the odd length. It's about 41 minutes. Also because of the contractual problems that I mentioned. So I'm thrilled that here on the 20th anniversary of the release of the film, it's coming out as a result of the new distribution mechanisms-- video streaming, et cetera. It's coming out to the larger public, and hopefully a lot more people will get a chance to see it than ever before. And also, it just so happens that 20 years after we made Sexual Healing, Helen Hunt made The Sessions, a movie in which she plays a sex surrogate and was nominated for an Academy Award. So it's an odd and kind of interesting book end to a part of her career. She played an innocent young housewife in 1993 who was introduced to phone sex, and then 20 years later she plays someone who's more experienced than just about all of us put together in the realms of sexuality. And both of those films, my modest one and then The Sessions, obviously a big feature with a lot of wonderful nuance to it, they both showcase sides of Helen Hunt's talent that aren't often seen in the other work that she does, and that's really gratifying to be a part of.
