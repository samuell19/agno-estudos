No excuses. This is the rule. - My other shoes are being washed, sir. - I said, no excuses. Put them there, and go stand over there. Look who finally showed up to school. Congratulations, Lala. You kicked ass! Bronze medal. Did you get a bonus from the government? Want a lunch treat? Take a number. So, tell me everything, Rino. Why are you and Diva not working out? - She doesn't need the details. - Yes, she does. Rino rejected Diva, who was crazy for him. I set them up, how awkward for me. Rino's right here, you know. And have you heard about the cute new kid? - What's his name? - I have no idea, but he's cute as hell. Yudhis, do you know what you did wrong? No coming late to class? No cheating during tests? The color of your shoes. I'm a new student here. Didn't they tell you the rules? Read the guidebook. - Rules are made to be followed. - Yes, sir. But why black, sir? The guidebook didn't say the reason. Rules are rules. If you have a problem, find another school. Sorry, sir. My mistake. - Assalamualaikum. - Wa'alaikumsalam, sir. This is the assignment for you to catch up on grades. Thank you, sir. Number five is wrong. The answer is 150. Hey! What are you doing? You said you wanted to work as a team, right? Twenty laps. Hey, look at that! We can do this. - This leg goes first. - This? Okay. - One. - Two. Three. Left! Left! Left, right, left! Louder! Left! Left! Left, right, left! - You okay? - Yeah. If you'd had just a little more guts, you didn't need to hide for that long. What if I did it on purpose? What if I wanted to hide longer? You're that Lala, right? What gives you that idea? Right after you won the National Sports Week... your little friend carried your picture around the court. She demanded that the whole school watch the broadcast of your competition. Typical Ega. You want to go out? Where? To the mall? No, thanks. Let's go somewhere we haven't been. Come on. What do you say? You know you want to. So? I'm not being too forward, am I? What? Favorite dish? Calamari. You? Chicken. I'm allergic to squid. - Favorite movie? - Anything drama. - Me, horror. - I hate being scared. What about heights? No, I hate heights. No way. Looks like we have nothing in common. Is that a bad thing? I don't know. I'm sure in this big world... with these many people... when two people meet... they must have something in common. When they just click... they'll find that common thing. Gentle giant. I love whales. Too bad they eat penguins. Whales are affectionate creatures. Gentle. You'll love them. Then you'll have a whale on your bracelet. This bracelet is my mom's last gift before she died. She always saw us as a family of penguins. She was a diver. Every time she jumped off that platform, my dad and I would wait by the pool. - I'm sorry. - No worries. I tend to ramble about her when someone brings her up. Okay, I've decided. I'm now Team Penguins. But you were right. I decided to go with you, and I'm having a good time here. So, now we have one thing in common. - Seriously? - Don't be a jerk! Thank you for today. My pleasure. Always charming the pants off of girls, aren't you? Are you charmed? I'm going in. - Where have you been? - Study group. You're impossible. Lala! We're leaving in five minutes. Morning, Dad. I just ran three miles. Exercise is no good without good nutrition. Here, drink up. We have to focus on her. Give her a chance. She's young. Very motivated. More practice? Your dad told you to? Don't you have plans with your friends? Go ahead, I'll be here awhile. Nope. Some things are more important. You're still up for more practice? Aren't you exhausted? Lala. Are you doing this because you want to... or because you were told to? Every time I take a dive, I feel Mom beside me. Why don't you go do things that you like first? I'll go with you. - Wait, we'll jump together, right? - Sure. - Promise? - Yes! One, two, three! I won! You're not asleep yet? Not yet. What are you up to? So you understand the selection rules for online college applications? Lala, make him your boyfriend. Dating should really be so much easier than 10-meter diving. What's going on back there? It's Ega, miss. Hey, come on! Lala! You drink first. If I drink, I'll want to pee. I'll pee my pants, I swear to God. - I know you can hold it. - Says who? Smarty pants! Lala, any question? Only ten spots in Indonesia's SEA Games Team. So, I want your full commitment. Confidence, courage, and dive with all your heart. Jihan is my benchmark. - Jihan, how old are you? - I'm 15, sir. - Who did you go to Jakarta with? - Just me. Why did you go to Jakarta? To win a SEA Games gold for Indonesia. Once again, why did you go to Jakarta? To win a SEA Games gold for Indonesia. Good. Lala, thank you for today. No, thank you, Rino. Bye. When I built this house, I supervised everything. I only wanted the best materials. I'll do the same thing for your future. Mom, it's not like I'll commit crimes or anything. I just want to live on my own. A rented room in Bandung? So, I'm not moving in with you? Why are you so against me living with you? You're all I have. Mom! I carried you. I gave birth to you. And I'm working my ass off for you. Only I know what's best for you. Yudhis, if I'm 10 minutes off my time, I'll have a bad record with my dad. Then Jihan will replace me. Lala... you'll still come in first place in my heart. That's what matters. Yudhis, please. Whatever, Lala. These past two months, you've spent mornings and afternoons at practice. At school, it's Ega and Rino. At night, you're always sleepy. Weekend... you're exhausted. Am I your boyfriend or your driver? Why are you so tense? I've worked my tutoring schedule around you. I didn't ask you to. I've given my all for this relationship. I can't say the same about you. Yudhis... I thought you'd understand my situation. Hey, stop! Lala, stop! Who told you to stand there? You're late. Back off! Wait there! Jihan... you're up! Four-zero-one! Great, Jihan! That's the way to do it. One more time. Timing's good. Now, try one-zero-five. Chop, chop! Hurry up! Jihan! Jihan... are you all right? Come here. Give me your hand. What went wrong? A laser beam hit my eyes, sir. Laser beam? Hey, you! Get down here! Yes, you! Are you trying to kill my kid? - Your kid? Lala? - Jihan! Why are you accusing Yudhis, Dad? You didn't point a laser beam to Jihan, right? No. You can check. Are you happy now, Dad? - Jihan. - I swear, sir, I got distracted by a laser beam. Leave my boyfriend out of this! Boyfriend? He's your boyfriend? How come I didn't know this? What for? You only care about my diving progress, right? There are many things you don't know about me. One less thing to worry about now. I'm quitting the team. Lala! Lala? You understand, right? Dad only had me, Mom, and diving. Mom is gone now. I'm off the team. I'm just worried how he'll hold up. Quitting the team is a brave... and honest decision. You and I are the same. They're asking us to be them. To listen to them. But do they ever listen to us? They don't even listen. Maybe they just don't know how. But I do. And I'll always be here for you. I'll always listen to you. Because, I think... the two of us are strong enough to take on a world this big. Okay? Now, I want to see you vent out. One, two, three. - Here? - Wait, wait. - How did it look? - Looks awesome! Hey, baby. No, just us girls. Okay, see you at 5:00. Bye. This doesn't feel right. You're no longer an athlete, but you have less time for us now. We just started dating, Ega. Give it a month, I'll get back to normal. Really? Yes, Rino! Sorry, pass. Oh, I know! No. What's it called? Who are you going out with? Is Rino there? Lala? - What? No? - Next! Who are you going out with? Is Rino there? Lala? Next! Lala, Yudhis just texted me, asking if you're with me. I said yes. - So attentive, unlike Rino. - Does Rino have a girlfriend? Don't be mean. It couldn't be. Because I knew you'd get upset if I told you the truth. Rino is my best friend. From grade school, and now we share a desk. Try getting to know him. And Ega, too. Answer it. No. Answer it. Best friend, right? Come on. - No, I'm not answering it. - Answer it. - No, I don't want to! - Answer it, God damn it! Tell him to get you the wallet. Hello? Lala? Yes, get me the wallet. Ega, call Rino now. Tell him not to come to my house. Call him yourself. What's wrong with you? I can't. I'll explain tomorrow. Lala? Lala? Lala? Hello, Ega? I'm in front of her house right now. Okay. Yudhis? Lala, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do it. I'm sorry. I will never hurt you. No. You can't break up with me. What we have is serious. I'm sorry, Lala. I'm sorry. - Sorry. Sorry! - Stop it! I will prove I deserve your forgiveness. Lala, what happened to you? Did you have a fight with Yudhis? I'm okay. It was just a misunderstanding. - Can I sit here? - Sure. - What's up? - Well... I meant to call you yesterday. Did he tell you what the problem is? Is it serious? He said just a little misunderstanding. I asked why and he wouldn't tell me. Look, Lala... We've been best friends since grade school, and we still get into fights. You guys just started dating, it's normal. Said the ever-single Ega. I may be single, but I've set up a lot of couples. You're lucky to have a boyfriend like Yudhis. You might not be so lucky next time. Just trust me, this is nothing. Happens all the time. To everyone. Listen to you, girl. You don't believe me? Lala. Have a seat. - Everything okay with school? - It's all right. Good. Have you decided on college? University of Indonesia, International Relations. I see. So, I think you should stay on the team. I'm sure colleges will prioritize athletes. You think I won't get in if I'm not an athlete? No, it's not that. If you quit the team, your career is over. So what? You'll disown me if I'm not an athlete? Is that it? Your career is the fruit of our family's hard work. It's your mother's legacy. I just wish you could be-- What, Dad? Be better than Mom? The only thing that is in vain is your dreams for me. I will never be as great as Mom. Take care, Rino! I'll listen if you're having problems with Yudhis What is it, baby? Nothing. Go back to sleep. I love you. I told you to share a cab with me. Don't ride a bike alone that late. Look what happened. Yes, lady. You sound like my mom. Don't get smart. It's a good thing we still see you here in class, not six feet under. What's wrong? Scared I'll haunt you all? You'll be the world's lamest ghost. I think they should revoke your license. Oh, please, no. Texting me while riding a bike? So irresponsible. What text? This. I don't remember anything. What? - This is my mom's car. - What happened to your car? - It's dented. - Why? What's with the sudden attention to my car? My birthday is tomorrow, Dad. I'm sorry. I won't be home tomorrow. Besides, the plan was to celebrate your birthday at athlete's camp. You're hanging out with Ega and Rino tomorrow? No, with Yudhis. While I'm not here, you're not allowed to have any boy over at the house. Of course not, Dad. Don't get out of control with your boyfriend. Your life is not only for him. You're so young. You're only-- Seventeen? Mom's age when you met her, right? It's a different era now. You see each other day and night. I heard you video calling him late at night. Yudhis is a nice guy, Dad. You just don't know him that well. And you had a bad first impression. You're supposed to be having this talk with Mom. But it's just the two of us now. I hope you understand where I'm coming from. If Mom were here, she'd ask me to get to know Yudhis. Respect my trust in you, all right? Happy birthday, baby. How did you get in here? With this. - Give me that! - No, I won't. What if I miss you? What if the neighbors find out? They won't. I can just vanish. Give it to me! No. - As long as you're happy. - Whatever! Have you decided on which college you want? No. They're still verifying my grades. You prefer a college here in Jakarta? My college of choice is out of town, in Bandung. My mom approved it. She's moving there, too. Bought a house in Bandung. Really? Bandung is a good city for what you want to study. There's a good college there for you. Babe, you didn't get the waiters to sing happy birthday to me, right? Make it full. - I'm going to the toilet. - Okay. Do you want a receipt? Sure. What's wrong, Lala? You got a call. Who? Problem? Forget it. What's wrong? Just tell me. Lala. Do you have anything to do with Rino's accident? The dent in your car? Are you accusing me? That's not what I meant. Hold on. I don't get it. You asked me to get to know them. I did that. I hung out with them, I talked with them. I did all that for you. So why are you accusing me now? Have it your way. This relationship is going nowhere without trust. It's really simple. Trust or no trust. You really don't remember who ran you over? It wasn't Yudhis. We went home in different directions. And he even told me to take care. Are you sure? I'm sure. Besides, what's important is, if you're having problems with Yudhis... I'm here for you. Thank you, Rino. Surprise. Can you wait at the cafe across the street for a minute? Who is it, Yudhis? Hello, ma'am. Hello. Who are you? I'm Lala. Yudhis' friend. Friend or "friend"? How come you've never introduced me? Are you the one also going to Bandung for college? And renting a room? Is she? Excuse me. Hello, sir. - Still remember me? - Of course I do. - Have you met Amel? - Hello, how are you? How was the trip? We can talk about this later. You're going to college in Bandung, right? I haven't told my dad yet. I have to go to the college in Bandung. My mom would kill me. But why there? When can I see your dad? Bandung? What about the college here in Jakarta? Well, Dad, I mean-- Here's the thing, sir. The college is a family tradition. So, I have to go there. Meanwhile... Lala can go to the other college there. Right, Lala. My daughter is an only child. I can't imagine her living so far away from me. I understand, sir. But I'm serious with Lala. I will take care of her there. I appreciate your honesty. But... committing to one person is a big decision. Maybe you should talk to your father first. You'll understand. I can't, sir. Because my father left my mother and I when I was little. Try this. This is delicious. I'm only saying, your future belongs to you. No one else. I know, Dad. Then why not let me make my decision? You don't have to worry. Don't talk to me about worrying. I've let my only daughter jump off a 10-meter high platform. I'm the one climbing the tower. I'm the one jumping off the platform. I'm the one facing the judges' scores. And I won, right? You did. But you always jump in doubt. If you're sure about your decision to study at the college in Bandung, then go. Why bring him here? Who are you trying to convince? Me, or you? I passed! Lala, you did, too, right? Did you pass? Did you? Did you get into the college? What's your excuse now? Are you still saying we're serious? My mom wouldn't have wanted me to leave Dad alone here in Jakarta. Think, Lala! You've abandoned your dad long ago. He doesn't even think you exist. To him, you're just an athlete. I'm the one who's always there for you. Sorry, Yudhis. Don't take the offer. Come to Bandung with me? That's not possible. I can't possibly leave my dad alone here. I can't. You're breaking up with me? Sorry, Yudhis. How many guys have you fucked? Walking away from me like it was nothing. How many? You're so selfish! Why don't you stay in Jakarta with me? This is my mom, Lala. Stop using her as an excuse. You're as big a coward as your dad! Yudhis, I said go. Go! Forgive me, Lala. I can't possibly hurt you. Lala, remember what we did. I don't care! Tell everyone what we did. I don't care! We're done! What's wrong? Yudhis, Dad. We're going to the police, now. Even I never laid a hand on you. I promise I won't see him again. I swear. What have you done with Yudhis? My mistake, Dad. I'm sorry. It's not just a mistake. You've shamed our family. Forget him, Lala. Yudhis needs me. He's not a bad guy. He's just... complicated. You can't solve all problems, right? But I'm the only one who can change him. My mistake, then. I set you both up. And I insisted that you go back to him after the fight. That's not it. I should've been more patient with him. Patience, then what? You're not responsible for him changing or not. Hi, thank you. Hi... - Lala. - Yudhis, we need to talk. We can fix this. Why aren't you packed? Please, Mom. I want to stay here. I don't want to move. I want to be with Lala. Say that again. I want to be with Lala. I'm happy here. Because of Lala? Can you be with her forever? Lala loves me, Mom. I'm the only one who loves you. - What? - Yes. I'm the only one who loves you. Now I understand why Dad left us. Come here. Don't ever mention him! You don't know what he's done to us. Don't be a smartass! Get up! Yudhis, know this... I'm the only one who loves you. Now go pack! Baby, let's leave. Let's get out of here. No, it's okay. I'm okay. Mom will apologize. I'm okay. Apologies won't do anything now. You won't be a good man if you continue living here. But your whole life is here. It's impossible. Some things are more important. You. Us. Lala. Lala! And... When a new day comes And brings you back Your laughter And... Slowly you'll forget me Your worst nightmare And the deep cut I've given you And you cried A river of tears Please forgive me And... I never meant to I never wanted to hurt you Understand that I hurt, too Neglecting you Casting you aside Please forgive me Just let me go If it can make you Light up and go like you used to Kill me with words If it can make you Light up and go like you used to Just let me go If it can make you Light up and go like you used to Kill me with words If it can make you Light up and go like you used to What's with the attitude? You'll end up an old maid. What's wrong? Lala? What is it, Lala? Those guys inside. Such douchebags! What did they do? Trying to talk to me, asking for my number. I said no, but they were persistent. And one of them grabbed my butt. Yudhis! Stop it! Yudhis! Don't be rude! Enough. Stop it! Let's get out of here! Lala... We're going home. I can't see you like this. No, I'm not going home. Look at you now, Lala. This is all my fault. I shouldn't have said anything. I can take care of you. If you're taking care of me, who will protect you from me? All right. Let's go now. Yudhis, come on. Jihan told the truth. I aimed the laser beam at her. I ran over Rino. And all of that can happen again. I can hurt anyone who is close to you. And I know why, Yudhis. This is not your fault. - I know why-- - Go home! Baby, we'll start a new life in Bali. I can teach diving to kids. We'll use the money for your study. We'll save. We'll get married and buy a house there. I need you, I can't live there alone. Impossible, Lala. I can't even control my temper. How can I make you happy? I don't even know if I'm being honest right now. I could be manipulating you now. Okay. If you're breaking up with me, fine. You have the right to leave me forever. It's your right. But remember one thing. Wherever you go... I will always find you. We are distracted Much too high up Lured by the sun We forget the ground We are flying Much too long Seeking warmth Let's clean up. Then we'll have breakfast. We are distracted We are distracted The night falls And yet strangely We are far from spent We are distracted We are distracted We are distracted We are distracted I'm sorry, Dad. Me, too. The storm, dear, sir Has passed Am I wrong to ask for affection? In every daybreak You are next to me I am safe with you Forever Till we grow old Till we turn into ashes Six feet under Next to each other The storm, dear, miss Has passed Am I wrong to ask for affection? Through each tribulation You are next to me You are safe with me Forever Till we grow old Till we turn into ashes Six feet under Next to each other
