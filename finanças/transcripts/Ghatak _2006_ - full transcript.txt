You killed 5 people in one night. The people you've killed weren't saints. All of them were dirty swine! According to law, killing swine is a crime too. Hence, you are a criminal. I, DSP Ranabir Roy and criminals are mortal enemies. We could never get along. Criminals look for DSP Ranabir Roy so that they can kill him. And DSP Ranabir Roy hunts for criminals to put the bullets of his revolver to use. What are you waiting for! Put your bullets to use. Then I'll thank you before I die for relieving me of my pain. If you tell me what your pain is I will thank you. That's because before they die no criminal has ever said that to me. I am not a criminal! I came to this city from my village with a dream. I wanted to give a good upbringing to my brother. I wanted him to study well. However, as soon as I arrived here I got an introduction of the city. Run! Help! Run! Please, save me! Please help me. They'll kill me. Please help me, sir. No.. Leave me! No.. No! No.. Save me.. They'll kill me. No! Brother! Raj. Make arrangements to send the dead body to a morgue. Take a few of these bystanders along in our van. I'll lodge a case on them being men from rival gangs. Catch them! No! Let go of my brother! Please let him go.. - Why are you arresting me? Let me go. - Leave him! I haven't done anything. Get them down! Come on. Come out. Come on! These scoundrels cause problem every day. Rascals! You don't let us be in peace. Count them one by one. Greetings, Mr. Basak. What's the matter? Why do you look so sad whenever you see me? You always ruin my plans. Had you done everything honestly, I wouldn't have to chase you to ruin your plans, right? You seem to have brought many people today. Where did you get so many of them? They are Bablu Kole and Bindu Mashi's goons. A murder took place today. You let the real criminals escape and arrested innocent bystanders! Please mind your own business. It's the human rights commission's job to ruin your plans. I am a lawyer of the human rights commission. So, I must run after you to foil all your plans. Why have you been caught? - We don't know anything, sir. The policemen threw us into the van while beating us up. I was going to buy grocery. He came and pushed me into the police van. He told me that to say that I'm from Bindu Mashi's gang. Don't feign innocence. I'll skin you alive. Mr. Basak! Seeing you, they are making excuses. I know that you aren't honest either. Why are you trying so hard to prove that you are? The court would demand their criminal records. You will need a lot of time to create their fake criminal records. By then I will ruin your plans in a few seconds! Let them go. Go home. Mashi, listen to me first. If Bablu has murdered any of your boys I won't give him shelter, okay? I've requested you not to create a problem before elections. Lie low for a few days. Do your prayers. Yes, I've sent your name to the party president. You'll contest the elections this year. Ask your boys to stay calm before the elections. If a single murder is committed now, I'll be in trouble. And if I am in trouble all of you will have to suffer, I'm warning you. Who is calling me now? It's Bablu Kole! Five missed calls from Bablu Kole. I just got rid of one now the other one is irritating me. Lord Narayana! Glory to You, Oh, Goddess. I had been calling you, why didn't you answer? Oh, Goddess! You have switched off the phone. Let me bow before the God. Then I'll talk to you. It is said that old habits die hard and old scoundrels don't change no matter what you do. You may not want to hear it but this is the truth. The more I'm trying to shape you up the more you are adamant on ruining your reputation. Who asked you to kill Bindu Mashi's hoodlum in public? Couldn't you do it secretly? Sometimes, I feel like killing myself. You commit a murder every single day. Bindu Mashi's people extract money in my neighbourhood. How can I tolerate it? If you don't want to tolerate it, you'll suffer. Election commission has directed that no one with a criminal record can contest in elections. Now, pretend to be a decent person from now on. Otherwise you won't be able to contest elections. What about my candidature? What about depositing money in my account? When the ticket is stuck the money is stuck too. I've given your name to the party president. It will be signed within a few days. Before that happens the money will be deposited in your account. Brother, it's so cold. What are you doing here in this rain? We wanted to spend the night here. But it started raining. Don't you live here? I've arrived in this city today with my brother. I had thought of getting a job by requesting someone. But my entire day was wasted because of the police. Police caught you! Did you steal money or pick a pocket? Murder. Murder! Did you commit a murder? No, I didn't. Someone else did it. The police caught us for no reason. There we came across a good lawyer. So, we were saved. What will you do now? If you get drenched in the rain all night you'll have to go to a hospital tomorrow. You and your brother should come with me. Come on. Dad! Will you give me the key of your old office? Why do you need it? - Give me. I need it. How many people are they? What do you mean? How many people are you letting stay there? How did you know I was going to let someone stay in that room? I know you, that's why! That room is infested with rats. I'm sure you aren't going there to teach nursery rhymes to those rats. Tell me who you are letting stay there. A man and his brother have arrived to this city from their village. They have no place to stay. They were getting drenched. If they can share that room with those rats it may solve their problem for a while. Should I let them stay there? - Of course. But don't take the responsibility of chasing those rats. Okay. Be careful. Your mom shouldn't find out. I will stop you from helping others, won't I? Who are you helping this time? It isn't anything big! Two brothers have arrived from their village. They were getting drenched. Puja is letting them stay in the old office room. Let them stay there. But if anything untoward happens, don't complain to me. This is your room. Listen. - Yes? Do you have any knowledge regarding rats? - Rats! Yes. Tree rats, house rats.. Have you seen those? - Yes, there are a lot of rats in our village. Fine! That means, you are acquainted with rats. This is their room. If they ask you anything you may tell them that until you make alternative arrangements you'll stay here. Okay? Excuse me. How much will be the rent? Discuss that with the rats. Look at you! Tree rats, house rats.. Let me dry my house rat. - What? Answer me! Hit me more! Once Bablu gets the candidature I'll slaughter you all on the streets. Bablu won't get the candidature for this election. I've booked him a ticket to the crematorium! Throw away this corpse outside Bablu's house. Tell him that, I've sent him an offering. Hurry up! Come inside. Yes, let's go. Where do you want to go? I want to get my brother enrolled in this school. Which way is the principal's office? No ordinary child can be enrolled in this school. Go. Go away from here. Brother, won't I be able to get enrolled in this school? I will get you enrolled in this school, for sure. Okay? - Yes. - Let's go. Strange people! Take it. Hey, kid, which way is the principal's office? - Over there. Okay! Let's go. Sir.. - Who are you? Who.. Who are you? My name is Bijoy. - He is Raju. Raju.. - Hey, don't touch! Don't touch! Sir, we are from Maslandapur. What? You've come here from Maslandapur to urinate! No.. - Couldn't you go elsewhere? No, we aren't here to urinate. - Idiot! Sir! Sir! Sir! Sir! - Disgusting! Let me clean it. - Don't touch me. Sir.. - What? - Please, listen! Kindly, get my brother enrolled in your school. - What? He has studied up to 4th grade. He knows a lot. - Raju recite something. 'A' for apple. - Yes!- 'B' for bat, - Yes! 'C' for cat.. - Yes! 'D' for dog. - Yes! - Cats are feline, dogs are canine.. Shut up! Sir, he can sing, too. - Raju, sing something. "Give me a glimpse of you." "Give me a glimpse of you.." "Come to me once." - Bijoy! Raju! - "Come to me once." - That was enough, beautiful! Sir, will you enrol him now? Get out of here! What's the matter, sir? This fool has brought his stupid brother to get him enrolled here. Greetings! Get him enrolled. - What do you mean? Do you think he'll come up to the mark if we get him enrolled? What if I take the responsibility to bring him up to the mark? Why? Why would you do that? Besides, why would I allow this? Sir, many kids get enrolled on basis of teachers' references. Let me refer someone who is not up to the mark. Okay, if you take the responsibility ask them to meet me in my office. Your brother will be enrolled here. Come to the office with me. Okay. Yes! Yes! "We have so many dreams in our lives." "We have so many dreams in our lives." "Our days are full of hope and love." "You are the light of my life." "You are the love of my life." "We have so many dreams in our lives." "We have so many dreams in our lives." "Our days are full of hope and love." "You are the light of my life." "I am the love of your life." "You are the light of my life." "You'll have to shine like the sun. Only then will our lives brighten." "This dark night will end into a beautiful morning." "If I become bright like the sun, you will have to be like the sky!" "I want to stay in your heart all the time." "I know that you'll show light to everyone." "We have so many dreams in our lives." "We have so many dreams in our lives." "Our days are full of hope and love." "You are the light of my life." "You are the love of my life." "That beautiful day will come soon." "I have faith that it'll." "Time is flying, without any restrictions." "You are right next to me, so I am not afraid of obstacles." "We will win for sure, and defeat our fears." "I've found a new meaning of living." "We have so many dreams in our lives." "We have so many dreams in our lives." "Our days are full of hope and love." "You are the light of my life." "You are the light of my life." "I am the love of your life." "You are the light of my life." Put this pack into the taxi. - Okay. Be careful. Keep it. You have a lot of debt. If you could pay me some money now.. Everyone in this area has two fathers. One, is their biological father and the other is their godfather. That's me, Baba Sheikh. Didn't your father warn you not to ask for money from your godfather? No! I made a mistake. I won't repeat it.. I made a mistake. Don't forget this. - Sure.. No! Let's go. Stop on the left. Stop right here. Take out the pack from the back. Take it inside. Sir, Rs. 70. What for? - The taxi fare. You are new to this business, aren't you? That shopkeeper asked for money from me. What did he get? Didn't you notice? Do you want that? I need to buy schoolbooks for my brother, by tomorrow. Do you have a change of Rs. 100? Yes, I have. Consider that you've got the money. Give me my money. Hey! - What is this? Pay me the taxi fare. Why are you hitting me? Listen to me. Don't you dare say a word. I'll kill you right now. Were you trying to kill him or were you caressing him? In my village love and fight look quite different. But everything is the same here. I didn't get it from a distance. So, I came here to notice. Is it okay? - It's okay. You were showing him love. Had that been a fight I would've shown you how we love people. I would've taken you on my Jeep and played 98.3 FM radio. 'Radio Mirchi. It's hot!' There you go. - How much? Rs. 110. - Okay. Here. - Thank you. From now on, the people of this area will have only one father. Their biological father. No Godfather will be accepted. Why were you fighting with them? Why didn't you think about Raju before you acted that way? If any harm comes to them, no one will regret it. But your brother's life is associated with yours. Who will look after him if any harm comes to you? He tore all of Raju's new books. How will he study now? He won't be able to answer any of the questions his teacher asks. He will be thrown out of school. I can tolerate everything. But if anyone tries to harm my brother I won't tolerate it. I'll kill such a person. Of course, why won't you do that? You will kill them and they'll kill all of us. Then this house will turn into a battlefield of the goons. This is why I always tell you not to let stray people stay in our house. Listen! A decent family lives here. If you want to stay here, try to be a gentleman. Otherwise, you may go your own way. If my wife loses her temper you will be in trouble. She is very different from us. Then neither Puja nor I'll be able to keep you in this house. So what if his books are torn? Books could have been bought again. I would've bought him those books. I don't want to see you involved in a street fights again. You've done a lot for me. But, I won't beg to anyone to take care of my brother. I'll drive taxi for longer hours and buy him books again. Long live! - Bablu Kole! Long live! - Bablu Kole! Long live! - Bablu Kole! - Put me down. Long live! - Bablu Kole! Greetings, sir. I am Bablu Kole. I'm contesting the elections this year. Kindly, take care of me. Your photograph is pasted on the wanted board of the police station. I've already seen it. Pray to God that I don't have to see more of you. That's because if I see anyone too often that person's family members get shocked after seeing him. 98.3, Radio Mirchi. It's hot. Sister! Sister! - What's the matter? That scoundrel, Binoy have betrayed your trust. He gave the candidature to Bablu Kole. Sister, if Bablu wins the election he will make the entire police force chase us. He will ruin our lives. I'll talk to Samanta. Munna, ask him to get my car. - Okay. Ram is eating. - Ram is eating. Ram is eating. - Ram is eating. What is that? It's present continuous tense. Present continuous tense! - Disgusting! Look at the condition of the room. Is this a room or a cowshed! You keep studying. Come on. Ma'am, are you here to teach me or to tidy up the room? Don't act too smart! If you don't top your exams, I'll throw you out. Will you really do that? Yes. Wouldn't your sister-in-law do the same? You are right. She would've thrown him out too. Why are you so late? I went for vegetable shopping. You've brought vegetables now! - Yes. Will you cook all night? When will you eat? Is it tomorrow morning? There is no need to cook. Do you want us to starve, then? I didn't mean that. Have dinner with us. What do I do with him? What? Load shedding! Yes! I don't have to study now! Yes! Hey! Shut up and sit here. I'll get a candle. Brother! No, I won't interfere. Or else she will scold me too. Bindu Mashi. What brings you here? You don't come anymore to have betel leaf from me. So, I came here to give you a betel leaf. You ruined our bond, Mr. Samanta, isn't it? Why do you say that, Mashi? We aren't new friends. I still love you as much as I loved you earlier. Before you claim anything else ask your men to leave, Mr. Samanta? Look! We still share a sweet bond. You didn't shout at me in front of my guards. - I'll do that now. I've experienced a lot of things in my life. But I haven't met anyone like you. You wear white clothes and roam around in different cities as a minister who helps you to do that? I do. It's all because of me, Bindu Mashi. At the time of the voting I've bombarded the booths to print votes for you. My gang members made sure that you get 60 percent of the votes. Only then, you could win. Only then, you could become a minister. I don't deny that, Mashi. - Shut up, you scoundrel! Let me finish first. Although you promised me yet you helped Bablu get the candidature! Bablu approached someone at a higher place. The party president recommended his name. But I've told them clearly that you should be the mayor of corporation of this city. Then the entire city will be in your hands. You may enjoy your position as the mayor. To hell with the position of mayor! I don't accept charity. Whether your party gives me candidature or not I will contest in the elections against Bablu Kole. There is a lot of time in the elections. You will find out who wins much before that. Is it Bablu Kole or me? Just wait and watch what happens. Come on, let's go. This isn't the way to the school. We aren't going to the school. Then? Be quiet and drive to the place where I ask. We've come quite far. Where are we headed? I'm taking you somewhere to make you look civilized. Ma'am, aren't we civilized? Not yet. Come in. This way. - Okay! Yes. Go and try it. Do you want me to wear this? - I didn't choose it for myself, did I? Go and try these. Don't change here! Go there. - Okay.. He is totally uncouth. What are you waiting here for? Go! I'm going. Oh, God! - Come in. - Okay.. Do I need to take that off? - Turn around. Hey! That's my hero's photo! My hero! Yes! Raju, how' this? - Fine! Quiet. People are watching you. I don't miss any of his movies. Quiet! Come with me. 'Turn around. Don't look into my eyes.' Sit down. 'I want to apologise to you.' 'I couldn't sleep all night.' 'All the old memories..' What? - Put your leg down. Are you kidding? 'If someone hits you on the left cheek, extend the right one.' 'Look! He didn't hit.' Hit him.. Hit him hard! - Hit him.. Hey! Sit down! "Oh, my companion!" "I'm really scared." "May this night never.." "The blue skyline" "is within my reach." "You aren't away from me." "You are right in my heart." "The blue skyline" "is within my reach." "You aren't away from me." "You are right in my heart." "My life is full of" "the tides of love now." "Across this blue sea" "my dreams take flight." "Across this blue sea" "my dreams take flight." "The love deep in my heart" "is expressed through my eyes now." "The soft sunlight" "has brightened my world." "The love deep in my heart" "is expressed through my eyes now." "The soft sunlight" "has brightened my world." "So, in this beautiful place" "many hopes arise in my heart." "Across this blue sea" "my dreams take flight." "Across this blue sea" "my dreams take flight." "The star-strewn night sky" "keeps me awake." "Your beauty is like the moonlight." "I think about you all the time." "The star-strewn night sky" "keeps me awake." "Your beauty is like the moonlight." "I think about you all the time." "That's why, your love" "creates music in my heart." "Across this blue sea" "my dreams take flight." "Across this blue sea" "my dreams take flight." Dad! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! - Shaheen! Shaheen! Mom! - Shaheen! Shaheen! Shaheen! Mom! Get lost! Run away from here! Mom! - Shaheen! Mom! - Shaheen! Shaheen! Mom! - Shaheen! Mom! Shaheen! No! No! No! Baba Sheikh! Please let me go, Baba Sheikh. If I don't reach with this bottle of blood at the right time a child will lose his life. You may hit me later, if you wish to. Please let me go. Wait! Wait! Let me make you bleed first! Then you may go. I will need this later to teach you a lesson. No! Nurse, take it. 'O' positive blood group. Don't worry. Your son will be fine. Everything will be fine. Shaheen! - Shaheen's dad is here. What are you doing here? Yes, he saved our son's life. He brought our son to hospital. He brought him blood, too. Had he not helped us I would've lost my son. I was so angry with you. I wanted to kill you. But you.. You were about to lose your life to save my son! - Baba Sheikh. Your son is about my brother's age. Had my brother been in his place would I have let him get hurt? Would God forgive me then? No, Baba Sheikh. You had hurt me. So, I hit you to seek revenge. If you are still angry with me you may hit me to seek revenge. If I harm you God won't forgive me. Shaheen won't forgive me. I should hug a God send like you. Yes. This is great! You are a responsible officer of this area. But instead of doing your duty, you are listening to music! This is what I used to do in my village. Now that I'm free, I listen to music. Radio Mirchi. It's hot. "Radio Mirchi is hot." This isn't your village. That's what I'm sad about. I was so happy there. Wipe the dust off the chair and take a seat. Now tell me what your complaint is. I don't have only one complaint. There are thousands! Start with one. They'll end at zero. I hope you've heard about Bindu Mashi. Everyone here knows her name. And I'm a police officer. How can I not hear her name? Then I'm sure you know that Bindu Mashi's men have created a ruckus in Bakultala. They've hit people and broken shops. They've tortured women. No one has come to complain about it at the police station yet. Just because no one complained, you didn't feel the need to go there. You are relaxing in your chair. Stop it! Before you accuse me point a finger at yourself. You are the lawyer of human rights commission. If you have the courage go and lodge a case against Bindu Mashi. Give me the warrant. Then you'll see how I make Bindu Mashi dance to the tunes of my radio. I've done that a lot in my village. I'll file a case and bring a warrant against her. Then I'll see if you make her dance to your tunes or you eat the betel leaf she serves everyone. "You stay next.." Have you ever thought what could happen? The chief minister scolded me because of you. Let me tell you something clearly, Mashi. If we don't stop killing each other, all of us will die. Mr. Samanta, why didn't you think about it when Bablu slaughtered my husband on the streets? I will fight Bablu till one of us dies. I will win the elections and kill Bablu. That will be the end of this fight. Forget about winning, you won't even be able to contest. Who will stop me from contesting? Will you? - Ramchandra, the election commissioner. Satyabrata Roy, the human rights commission's lawyer is filing a case of human welfare against you in the court. Anyone with a criminal case can't contest the elections. That's the election commission's rule. I informed you in advance. I hope you won't be in the jail when the election results are announced! Oh, Goddess! I won't have a betel leaf today. I'll have it after the elections. Oh, God, please help. Raju! Raju, what's the matter? Raju! Did you fail in the exams? Tell me. - Brother! I've topped in the exams. You've topped! - Yes. Really? Yes! Yes! - Yes! My brother has topped in his class! Tell me what you want. Today, I'll give you whatever you wish. Don't give me anything. I topped because Ma'am tutored me. - Yes! So, you should gift her something. What should I give her? - Give her a gift. I see. - Give that to her and say something to her. - What? I'll tell that to you later. Buy a gift first. Raju has topped in his class. All thanks to you. I will always be indebted to you. Bijoy! This is for you. Take it. Brother, now tell her. Okay. Thanks.. Thanks.. Thanks.. Brother! - Thanks.. Thanks.. - Brother! He has come from a village. He stays in the outhouse. My daughter tutors his brother. He has topped in his class. So, he is here to inform that. We've learnt a lot, Mr. Roy. - Let's go. Look! - I saw a lot. I don't need to see anything else. Let me give you an advise, Mr. Roy. If you have a groom in your house why do you want your daughter to marry some other man and ruin her life? Get your daughter married to him. Let's go. - No! Thanks, you came at the right time. - What is.. You scoundrel! Did we allow you live here for ruining my daughter's life? Get out of here! Hey! Get out! Get lost! - Brother! - Get out of my house! I will never follow your advice. Why do you give silly advise? 'Hold her hand and say, thanks.' Had I known it was going to cause such trouble.. Thanks doesn't mean anything bad. It's good. - Shut up! Don't say another word! Had it been good, why did they get upset then? We need to leave before she arrives. Let's go. - Come on. I'm here to thank you for two things. Firstly, thank you for gifting me such a beautiful sari and secondly, thank you for ruining that alliance in time. Actually, I didn't want to get married. "If you come closer with a smile and a look at me" "you give me hope of a touch." "If you come closer with a smile and a look at me" "you give me hope of a touch." "I want to share my naughty wishes with you." "My heart dances with joy in this love." "My heart dances with joy in this love." "My heart dances with joy in this tide of love." "My heart dances with joy in this love." "My heart dances with joy in this love." "My heart dances with joy in this tide of love." "If you come closer with a smile and a look at me" "you give me hope of a touch." "We still have a lot to share" "I can't express everything with my eyes." "We still have a lot to share" "I can't express everything with my eyes." "There is no need sweet-talk me." "I will come into your arms whenever you call me." "Why don't you share your naughty wishes with me?" "My heart dances with joy in this love." "My heart dances with joy in this love." "My heart dances with joy in this tide of love." "My heart dances with joy in this love." "My heart dances with joy in this love." "My heart dances with joy in this tide of love." "What if I don't understand the meaning of your songs?" "I lose and find myself again and again!" "What if I don't understand the meaning of your songs?" "I lose and find myself again and again!" "You understand everything. Then why do you feign innocence?" "Come closer to me and lose yourself into my arms." "Our desires have set our hearts on fire." "My heart dances with joy in this love." "My heart dances with joy in this love." "My heart dances with joy in this tide of love." "If you come closer with a smile and a look at me" "you give me hope of a touch." "If you come closer with a smile and a look at me" "you give me hope of a touch." "I want to share my naughty wishes with you." "My heart dances with joy in this love." "My heart dances with joy in this love." "My heart dances with joy in this tide of love." "My heart dances with joy in this love." "My heart dances with joy in this love." "My heart dances with joy in this tide of love." "My heart dances with joy in this love." "My heart dances with joy in this love." "My heart dances with joy in this tide of love." "My heart dances with joy in this love.." "My heart dances with joy in this tide of love." Greetings, attorney. I've heard everything. You have filed a case against me. This is a fight between Bablu and me. Why are you getting involved in this? Had this fight been between you and Bablu I wouldn't have interfered. But innocent people are being dragged into this fight between the two of you. That's why, I've filed this case. You don't file this case. It will be harmful for me. You harm so many people and you expect them to tolerate it without a say. That isn't done! Someone has to put an end to this. You scoundrel! You are crossing your limits. I'll kill you right here. - Munna! I am talking to him. He is a gentleman. Be decent to him. I beg of you. I am even ready to fall at your feet. I don't want to come to you again. No matter how many times you do that I will take this matter to the court. You may do all the requesting and begging in the court, in front of the judge. He is going to give the verdict. You didn't keep my request, then! I can't do it. Let's go. Raju! What's the matter? Will you tell me what's wrong? What's the matter? Raju! What's the matter, Raju? Hey! Raju! Raju! What's wrong with you? Speak to me, Raju. Raju? - Raju! Raju? - Raju? What's wrong with Raju, Puja? - I don't know. He isn't talking. Raju! Raju! - Raju? - Brother! No.. Brother, Mr. Roy was.. Someone has been murdered over there. There.. Tell me. - Brother. Brother! Dad! Dad! Dad, talk to me. Dad! Dad! Dad! Brother. Dad! Dad, please talk to me. Brother, I don't want to live here. I don't want to live here. I don't want to live here. Kill that boy! - Calm down, Bindu Mashi. Satyabrata Roy was not an ordinary lawyer. He was the lawyer of the human rights commission. His murder has already created a fiasco. The DSP of Police is handling this case himself. If you murder that child let alone me no one will be able to help you. Make arrangements so that the child doesn't reach the court. You will have to think of a way to do it. I'll take care of the rest. Mom! Mom! Mom! - I used to tell him all the time not to meddle with others' matters. He never listened to me. He used to laugh at me. He used to say that as a human being if he couldn't help his fellow human beings he wouldn't deserve to be called a humane. They killed your father and left him on the streets. No one came to help him. You are not the only one in pain, Mom. It's mine too. I may have the pain of losing my father but I'm proud of my father, too. I have buried my pain and am holding to the feeling of pride. Raju has seen dad's murderers. I will get each one of them arrested and punished. No! You won't do that. You won't go anywhere. Mom! You had many complaints against dad. Don't you have any problem with those who murdered him? I do. But I'm scared. If you try to go against them they won't spare you either. - Mom! They don't have any regard for your life, Puja. But you mean the world to me. Mom! Please do this much for the sake of my life. I beg of you. - No. No, Mom. Please don't say that. No, Mom.. Mom! Listen, I want Bijoy's brother. If he appears as a witness in court of law Bindu Mashi will be arrested. Then no one will be able to defeat me in the elections. Abduct the boy and keep him in my care. Go on! - Yes, let's go! Now, Bindu Mashi.. No one will be able to save you. Please leave this place. I don't want to stay here, Brother. Take me back to the village. If they find out that Raju has seen them they'll kill Raju, too. Before that happens, go away from here. A noble man was murdered! Until the murderers are punished for their crime I won't take Raju anywhere. You will go. I don't want Raju to be harmed. Please leave tonight. I came to the city from my village to lead a better life. You're asking me to leave amidst such a crisis! - Yes, I am. You need to save Raju. You need to save your life. No matter how much we suffer you should leave, Bijoy. The man who had given shelter to two helpless brothers like us Raju witnessed his murder! And his murderers instead of being punished will go free! No, please don't ask me to leave and betray such a man. Please don't ask that of me! Raju will bear witness in the court against them. For the sake of Raju's life, leave from here, Bijoy. For the sake of my life, you will have to leave. Go and find that child at any cost. He shouldn't be able to escape. Go! Let's go. I will call you, Ma'am. Do you remember my phone number? Yes, I've written it in my homework notebook. Good boy! Do you want to have some chips? - Yes. Wait. Don't go anywhere. - Okay. I'll be right back. Brother.. Help! Brother! Raju! - Brother! Raju! - Brother! Brother, help me! - Raju! Brother, help me! Brother! Raju! Raju! - Brother! Ma'am.. Move! Ma'am! Brother, help! Hey! Brother! - Raju! Brother! - Raju! Brother! Raju! - Raju! Brother! Brother, help! Come on! - Ma'am! - Raju! Brother! - Raju! Brother! - Raju! Raju! Brother! Raju! Brother! Help me! Brother! Brother! Raju! Come on! Brother! Brother! Brother! It's hurting, Brother! Nothing has happened to you, Raju.. Brother, I.. I won't be able to study further. I am going to leave you, Brother. - Hey! Don't say that! Where will you go? You can't go away from me. I won't let you go. I will save you. Your brother will save you. Raju, you won't go anywhere! I won't let you go. I will save you. Nothing is wrong with you! No harm will come to you. I won't let any harm come to you. I won't let any harm come to you. Doctor! Doctor! Brother! No harm will come to you. No harm will come to you. I won't let any harm come to you. Raju! Raju! Come on! Here you go! I won this chance. Here you go. Oh, no! You make a move. - Wait for me. I came to this city to lead a better life. I wanted my little brother to grow up well. But this city snatched my brother away from me. It turned me into a murderer. Among the five people you killed one of them was still alive. Yes! I've killed him. The people you have killed are just pawns. The real culprits are at large. Kill them if you can. If they are left alive many innocents will have to die. Bijoy! I won't file your case. But I'll keep it in my mind. Go away. Listen! If you kill anyone this time, don't leave him half alive! Make sure the person is dead! Then, both you and the law will remain unharmed! Such things are quite common in my village. You may go. Long live Bindu Mashi! Long live Bablu Kole! Long live Bindu Mashi! Long live Bablu Kole! Long live Bindu Mashi! Long live Bablu Kole! Long live Bablu Kole! - Long live Bindu Mashi! Long live Bablu Kole! - Long live Bindu Mashi! Long live Bindu Mashi! Vote For Bablu Kole! Vote For Bablu Kole! Vote For Bindu Mashi! Long live Bindu Mashi! Vote For Bindu Mashi! Long live Bindu Mashi! Long live Bindu Mashi! Sister, he is Bijoy. I had told you about him. Go and vote for me tomorrow morning. If a single vote in this area goes to Bablu Kole I'll seek revenge after the elections. I am here for you, your own Bindu Mashi! Please vote for me. Greetings. Please vote for me. Long live Bindu Mashi! Will we be able to cast our votes this time? Even if we can't, they will. They just have to get votes. Don't go inside. Maintain the queue. Is everything alright, Mr. Basak? Don't worry, sir. I'll stay here all the while. That's my reason to worry. Sir, there is a chaos in one of the booths in the south. Okay. I want you to stay exactly like this till 5 p.m. You can come over, now. What's your name? - Lalit Mohan Das. Will you vote for me? Go on. Vote for Mashi. She loves me a lot. What's the matter? Why did you take the machine? Hey! Sit down. You'll get your payment, otherwise, you'll have to pay for your death. What do you want? - I want to vote. Go away. Your vote has been casted. I haven't voted yet. How can my vote be casted? Get out! Votes are being forged inside. - Okay. Why are you quietly standing here? - It's okay. They threw me out at gunpoint. - It's okay. We couldn't.. - I will check. Calm down. I told you that I'll check. The vote has been casted. I will cast it myself. Hey! Let her come. 712, Puja Roy. Let her go. - Hey! My sister had told you that if a single vote in this area goes to anyone else she'd make everyone pay after the elections. Not after the elections I will make you pay within 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. the official voting time. Catch her! Hey! We'll take revenge! Come on! Go, fast! Fast! Let me go! I'd thought that they'd kill you. But I will have to do it now. Those goons weren't letting people cast their votes. They tortured a woman inside the booth. But the policemen were enjoying themselves. So, I beat up the policemen and the goons. Write down whatever you want. I'll save the rest for Bindu Mashi and Kole. Hey! You left that. Sir? - Yes! He hit me in front of you. But you let him go. Do you know when do the neighbours hit a son in front of his father? When the father fails to teach his son a lesson. I couldn't teach you a lesson. That's why, the neighbours hit you in my presence. This isn't anything new. Such things are common in my village. Write down what he told you to and put it on my table. Otherwise, he will hit you again. I'll take your leave now. Okay. Basak! Who brought my brother to the police station? I haven't just brought him, I'm beating him, too. Inspector, you are crossing your limits. You haven't seen my limits yet, Mashi! I haven't yet started to beat him, to the tunes of my radio. Hey.. Don't hit my brother for no reason. For no reason, is it? Look! Look! This says that Munna and his goons entered the booth chased everyone away and forged votes. They even molested a woman. Before I send them to the court I'll leave them in a condition that you'll only see their bodies. I'll beat them black and blue. Scoundrel! - Shut up! If you stay here for another moment, you won't stay a candidate. I'll put you into the lock up and play my favourite music. It's hot! - To hell with your hot music! You, scoundrel! You have hurt my brother! I won't spare you! I won't spare you! I won't! I won't spare you! "The monsoon says something.." There was a day, when I had forbidden you to act like a goon. Today, I am asking you to eradicate those people you will have to fight them and act just like you did today! You will have to.. Puja! Her father did a lot of good deeds. But the best thing he did was to give you shelter. Probably, he knew that we needed someone who would oppose injustice. One day, I had asked you to leave this house. But today, I request you to stay with us. Hello? DSP Ranabir Roy speaking. Sir, I am speaking from Bakultala. People of Bindu Mashi are torturing everyone here. They are looking for Bijoy. Hurry up, sir. Mr. Basak? - Sir. Take a few constables and come with me. Bindu Mashi's people have attacked Bakultala to find Bijoy. Some of you, come with me. Others stay back at the police station. Hit them! Let's go to the police station. Oh, no! You couldn't save him! 'Special electoral news.' 'A widespread fiasco was seen in every polling booth' 'in Birpur of South 24 Parganas.' 'Along with bomb blasts and false voting, a woman was..' Let me tell you the rest of the news. Munna is still in the lock up. Those, who came to release him from the jail I've beaten them up and put them into the same lock up. Hey! - Quiet. No one knows I am here. If you scream I'll have to make use of my hands! People will get to know that I invited myself to your house to kill you. When you go to give food to Munna tomorrow, you'll know how I've hit him. Then you may use those weapons. Let me tell you something. The way you have killed my brother I will kill you in the same way. As long as you are inside the house you will live. As soon as you leave the house, you'll die. Inform that to Bablu Kole, too. Greetings! Did your driver lose his way or did you? I told the driver to come this way. I wanted to meet you for a very long time. I was busy with the elections, so couldn't manage time. I want to discuss something with you. Can we go elsewhere? If I had a romantic relationship with you I would've taken you elsewhere. You aren't here for romance, I believe! Somewhat that! You've done a great job by beating Bindu Mashi's brother, Munna and getting him arrested. How can I not love such a man? Join our party. So that, before the next elections I can throw out Bindu Mashi from this area. A man like you should be treated with great care. Everyone should touch your feet. Let me touch your feet. For my brother's murder Bindu Mashi and you, both are equally responsible And before the elections I will chase both of you out of this city. And for that I won't need any party's help. You still don't know this city. Yet, you are thinking about chasing me out of here! You are alone and I have two gangs. One of them is legal and the other is illegal. You will die. I don't think you had enough food at home. You seem really hungry to get a thrashing. Do you want me to fulfil your wish? Don't waste your energy on him. Just order me, I will teach him a lesson. Did you hear him? Don't wait anymore. If a crowd gathers, you won't even find way to escape. You will get a good beating then. You'll love it. Get lost! Go! A man! He came from a village to this city with a small bag. He hasn't even become mature yet and has become the boss of this area! He has troubled you today. Soon, he'll harass me. This is what happens if you fight between each other. Had you studied Bengali, you would know that proverb 'Let's work together, we won't be ashamed even if we fail.' If you don't share among yourselves you'll lose everything. I don't care! Say that to Mashi. You should listen too. The election commission has asked the candidates to give in writing that such incidents shouldn't take place any further. If such things happen it will be the candidates' responsibility. You will be arrested then. Now we have only one choice left! You will have to withdraw your candidature, Mashi. Did I come here to hear that? Listen to me first. I've made sure that you become the Mayor. I need both of you. What about Munna? I'll take care of that matter. He won't go to the jail. I promise you that. Listen, don't get into this matter. Are you listening to me? Greetings. Greetings! - Are you Mr. Bijoy? Yes. - Minister Binoy Samanta wants to talk to you. You shouldn't go. I won't let you go anywhere. Puja, listen to me. He has sent someone because he wants to talk to me. I shouldn't miss this opportunity. I will meet and tell him about Raju's murder and your father's murder, too. If he helps me no one will be able to save Munna or the others. Let's go. - Yes. Whatever happened on the day of the elections is very sad! I've made arrangements so that such a thing doesn't happen again. You won't see their faces before the next elections. I am not talking about what Munna did. I'm talking about what you did. It was wrong. They may be against me today. But they are my own people. They have helped me win every election. How can I just be a mute spectator to their plight today? Won't I be punished for that? I don't want to drag anyone else into this. Take this. Give me a thumb print on it. I'll write down everything. What will you write? - What? Shall I tell you in one line? You are withdrawing your complaint against Munna. I have promised the people in my area that I'd throw Bindu Mashi and Bablu Kole out of this city before the next elections. If I fail to do that won't the people in my area punish me for that? And even I don't want to drag anyone else in my matters. We won't argue about who is better right now! Right now, your thumb print is much more valuable than your life. Give me your thumb print. But my thumb print is more important for me than my life. So, I won't give you thumb print. I will give you something else instead. Hey! Make him give his thumb print. Bablu, take his thumb print. Bijoy! - Mr. Sheikh? I was going to send someone to see you. Why? What's the matter? Binoy Samanta's people took him away. They said that he wanted to meet Bijoy. Has he gone alone? - Yes. Okay, I'll find out. Don't worry. Shall I come with you? No, you don't need to come with me. I'll go and get him. You thrashed my brother and then got him arrested! Now you'll bear the consequences. Take him away! Throw him out. Glory to Goddess. Is Bijoy inside? - Who is Bijoy? He came here to meet the minister. He is tall and fair. He has left. He left? - Yes, just a while ago. Hey! Pick him up! Put him down. Open the lid. Throw him in. You showed me a paper with a thumb print and locked up my brother. I've also brought a paper with a thumb print to get my brother released. Bijoy has withdrawn his complaint. Now you'll understand. This is not the manner in which a complaint is withdrawn. Bijoy has to be present here to withdraw the complaint. Then I'll release your brother. And I know that Bijoy won't let me release even a single one of them. Tell me if you'll release them or not, you scoundrel! Hey! If I pull the trigger you will die before you can say that you are sorry. I am really a scoundrel! And if this scoundrel kills you no one will be bothered. I'll tell everyone that this was an encounter. I've done this in my village quite a lot of times. Put your gun down. Have a look, sir! He is torturing an innocent woman. If a woman is treated this way in a police station how would men be treated, just imagine. You won't be in-charge of any of the police stations here. You are suspended. Basak, open the lock up. You will stay that stupid villager. You can never change or improve. Glory to God. Now, face the music! This place won't change at all. No matter what you do this situation will be the same. Did you find Bijoy? - No. Pray to God. I hope no harm comes to Bijoy. Puja! Oh, Goddess I have never asked for anything for myself from you. But today, I wish for something. No matter where Bijoy is he should be safe. Dad! Dad.. Guys, hurry up! We need to open the lid. - Look, Dad. Wait, let call everyone! Call everyone. Lay him down. What's the matter, mister? - Someone fell into a manhole. We need to take him to the hospital. Please forgive me, I'm in a hurry. What kind of a person are you? Someone is going to die and you don't even care! Subal, bring him. Hurry up! Put him inside! Bijoy! "At the end of night, the morning bird chirps." "It asks us to wake up and we look around."

Long live Bablu Kole! Police! I am not here to kill you. I just wanted to cover your body before I killed you. After your death, you won't be able to see how your body is covered while being taken to cremation ground. Greetings! And I will begin from the left. Scoundrel! - Bablu Kole!- Long live! Binoy Samanta! - Long live! Bablu Kole!- Long live! Binoy Samanta! - Long live! Bablu Kole!- Long live! Binoy Samanta! - Long live! Bablu Kole!- Long live! Long live Binoy Samanta! Long live Bablu Kole! Long live Binoy Samanta! Long live Bablu Kole! Long live Bablu Kole! Vultures can't kill cows. But a cow can kick a vulture away. 98.3 Radio Mirchi. It's hot! Take care. You are all liars! Useless people! You claimed that you'd killed and thrown him into a manhole. How could someone come back from the dead? Don't worry. We'll take care of you. Oh, God! I am not worried about myself. I still have enough time. Both of you are on the top of his list. He said that he would begin from you. I am not worried about anything. I haven't changed just because I have become an MLA now. I am still the same man. I will only have to open the cover of the manhole once more. Darn it! Hey! Hey, You.. Where are you taking me to? I had been looking for a decent place to kill you. Now I've found one. No! Don't kill me. Don't kill me! Please don't kill me! I didn't kill your brother. Believe me, I didn't kill him. Don't kill me! What's the matter? - His phone is switched off since last night. I have a feeling that Bablu is dead. May his soul rest in peace. That means, it is your number now. The numbers will change, Mr. Samanta. This time, I will decide the number. You will have to go through a few tests. Why? Is there anything wrong? If what I am expecting, is the case then there is nothing wrong. It's good news. Hopefully, you are pregnant. Take this. - Thank you. I can kill all of you if I wish. But I won't kill you here. I will kill you in a place where you won't have a doctor or a nurse to take care of you. You will only have police and morgue workers to take your corpses away. Where are you going? I'm going to finish my job. You won't go. When you leave the house I have to spend every moment in fear! I keep thinking if everything would be alright. Will my baby be able to see its father after it is born? I can't spend my life with this fear, Bijoy! If you were so worried why did you rush to the police station for me when I had killed five people? Why did you bring me back to the house? Why did you save my life either? And why did you marry me? That's because the person to whom I had given shelter one day I wanted to find a shelter within him, for myself. Your life doesn't belong to you only. It belongs to me, too. I have a right over you. Puja, it's true that I belong to you and your baby. But, I belong to my dead brother and your late father, too. I can't think about one person's rights and forget about others. If you keep me here for the sake of your claim on me we will never be able to face them again. But if you forget your claim then Raju will know that his sister-in-law still loves her. Raju didn't belong to me only. He belonged to you, too. Bijoy! - What's the matter? What's the matter? Puja! Puja, what's the matter with you? What's wrong? Why are you doing like this? Tell me what is the matter with you. Puja! Puja! What is it? Why don't you watch your step? Munna, it's you! Sir, please save me! Please save me. He will kill me. Sir, please save my life. Please help me. - Out of all people you're requesting me! I am not in-charge of any police station now. I am free now. And that means I listen to 98.3, Radio Mirchi. It's hot. No! 98.3.. - "Radio.." It's hot. "Radio. Radio Mirchi.." No! Munna.. Munna! Munna! Scoundrel! What are you doing here? I have to send the dead body to the morgue. Send it. Go ahead. I'll send some more dead bodies. Take those to the morgue, too. Hey! Get my car! Bijoy! Scoundrel! Come out! What's the matter? Hey! You wretch! Tell me! Tell me where your son-in-law is! He is not at home. - Isn't he? Where has he gone? - I don't know. You don't know, right? Tell me. Tell me the truth. Tell me where he has gone. Tell me quickly. I don't know. - You don't know! Hello, Mom. We are done. We will be back soon. How much is the fare? - Rs. 70. I haven't bought the medicines yet. Is it? - You go in. I'll get the medicines. Okay. Puja! Follow her! Bijoy! Bijoy! Puja! Help! Puja! Puja! Catch her. - Catch her! Bijoy! Puja! Catch her! Bijoy! Bijoy! - Puja! Puja! Hey! Hey.. Puja! Hey! Doctor, how is Puja? - Luckily, she is safe. I was worried about her pregnancy. But everything is fine. She is fine. There is no need to worry now. If you want to call anyone, you'll have to press eight buttons Mr. Samanta. But if I.. pull the trigger once it will be the end of you. You've played games so far. Now it's my turn. Glory to Lord Narayana. I don't mind if that means I won't have to die. I won't kill you. I promise you. But you will have to do as I say. You've turned the tables. Tell me what to do. I've tolerated enough. But not anymore. On one hand, advocate Satyabrata Roy was killed. A small child witness that crime. He was killed, too. MLA Bablu Kole is missing. Only one person is behind all this. It's mafia boss Bindu Mashi. He is like a brother to me. He has come from the village. Bindu Mashi wanted to kill him, too. She wanted to kill his wife by running a car over her. She is in a hospital right now. The mafia is your pet! Oh, God! People have cats and dogs as pets. How can I have mafia as my pet? I want to end this mafia rule. I'm going to Delhi with my report tomorrow. Before I leave, I'll inform the police what to do. When I come back, I want to hear that the mafia boss, named Bindu Mashi isn't alive anymore. Ma'am, you have a call from the police station. Hello? - It's Basak, Mashi. Binoy Samanta has ordered the police to shoot you at sight. Leave this city before the police finds you. Otherwise, I won't be able to save you. I hope, I will be fine. Until things are solved with Bindu Mashi I don't want to stay in Kolkata. You don't need to bring the ticket home. Wait for me at the airport. I'll be there in 15 minutes. You are leaving me in this trap and trying to leave the city, Mr. Samanta! If I am a mafia boss you are the same. Do you know why I call you a nincompoop? This is the reason. You are a mafia and so am I. Where is the difference? You just kill each other without reasons. But I.. I plan murders and then pay respects to the dead bodies. People don't get to see the murders. They watch me pay my respect. So, I am a decent man and you are rotten. I'll see you after I return from Delhi. I hope you stay alive. See you again. You aren't going to Delhi, Mr. Samanta. I am standing here to make sure, you go to the cremation ground. What is going on? Bindu Mashi.. No! If we survive, we will survive together and if we die, we'd die together! I won't let you go alone, Mr. Samanta. Greetings. I've been waiting for you. I want to make you hear Radio Mirchi, 98.3. It's hot! To hell with you! Move from my way. Otherwise, I'll run you over. You won't be able to do that. Ever since I quit my job as a policeman I've taken up this new job. When I hear about someone's death, I stand with a music band. When someone dies vultures will arrive and then I'll play music and.. I'll play music and dance. - To hell with your music! Wait, I'll kill you right now. Hey, start playing. "Today, on your last day you should pray to God." "Tell me if you have any unfulfilled wish." "Today, on your last day you should pray to God." "Tell me if you have any unfulfilled wish."

You have committed enough crimes. You've tortured enough people, Bindu Mashi. I won't hit you just because you are a woman. I don't care if there are ten men like you. Let me go! - Bijoy! Let me go! Hit her! No, Bijoy.. - You've played enough with people's lives! Bijoy! You've ruined enough lives. No, Bijoy. Don't! Bijoy! Are you alright? Yes. Let's go, Puja. - Yes. Where are you going, Bijoy? I came to this city so that I could raise my brother properly. But he left us. I don't want to lose my unborn child, sir. You must live with your brother's memories and stay here, Bijoy. He is right. Raju's memories are attached to this city. Can we forget him and run away, Bijoy? Brother! Brother! Brother! Brother, please don't go away from me. - Raju. I will watch over you all the time. Yes, Bijoy. We will fight all chaos together and die together. Okay. I won't leave this city. We will live here. And we'll play 98.3, Radio Mirchi. Very.. - Hot! Start playing!
