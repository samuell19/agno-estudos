THE CHARACTERS AND SCENES IN THIS MOVIE DON'T RESEMBLE ANYONE. THEY ARE PURELY FICTITIOUS. JAI SENA Hello friend. Greetings to everyone. Our birth should make our mother happy. Our progress should make our father happy. Our way of life should make the society to celebrate. The future of every nation would be in the hands of youth. Their thought process is tomorrow's future. The present youth has started seeking change. Youth like Bhagat Singh, Alluri Sitaramaraju, Swami Vivekananda are still prevalent in our nation today. Youth are the basic pillars of progress of every nation. I won't keep calm if some misdeed happens in front of my eyes. I will question and fight. Youth can tear down a mountain if they determine to do so. They can even place a ladder to the sky and outrun the time as well. They can wage a war. Youth is power Jai Sena (Hail soldiers) Jai Hind (Victory to India) "Let's go... Let's go... Let's go..." [muffled panting] [muffled cough] [muffled whimper] One... Two... Three... -Where is the fourth guy? -Finish him off first, boss. -Damn! -Damn! Bloody nincompoops! What the hell were you doing when he escaped by bashing our men? What's the issue if they have escaped, boss? There would be a problem if he contacts the police. Ah! Damn! First go and catch him. [collision] [tyres screech] [muffled groaning] [takes deep breath] Sir... Sir... Sir... [coughs] -Sir... Sir... -Cool -Sir... -Be cool and narrate what happened. I and my friend are in danger, sir. Save... -Please save me, sir. -Hmm... If youngsters like act hastily, it will be a loss to your body. But if Mr Modi acts hastily, it is a loss to our nation. Be cool and narrate what happened. The opponent is a very powerful man. Sir, he has kidnapped me and my friends. If we are talking about the opponent being powerful, it means that we are fools. Why did they kidnap? We have cheated him, sir. You doesn't even have a proper moustache, and you have cheated him? He cheated the public, sir. That's why we have cheated them. Hmm... -Have a cigarette. -[coughs] -Have a smoke first. -Yes, sir. [puffs] Sir... By the way, you are... I am Godse, a CBI officer. If you tell me correctly, I'll get connected. [puffs] Sir... Having our childhood on the mother's lap, having friendship in the college days... When a friend stands support to his mate, that's a great support, sir. Our works would get accomplished for sure. Friends mean everything including happiness, emotions, fights etc. We four are like the care of address of mischief. In our college days...

I am Anasuya. I am the lecturer who is here to change your history. Don't worry. My aim is to make you score 100% from the current score of 60%. I am not only a lecturer. I am your friend and I am two types. Ah! [music mutes voice] In order to achieve something, you have to fall in love first. I love you, madam. Stupid! I meant, love your subjects, not me. Okay? Sit. [tyres screech] Son... Hey son. Yes. -Are you too from this college? -Don't you think so? I am the chairman and the principal of this college. -What might be your age? -I've recently crossed 40. -And I am 39. -Is it, little brother? Well, a principal would be sporting a suit and shoes. But what's with your T-shirt attire? This college was built by my grandfathers. -Oh! -So, it is my wish as this is my college. You are a God, sir. You'd realise if I am a God or a ghost when you don't pay the interest amount. -Mr Murthy -Sir... Take out that list. Okay, sir. Sir, put that cash out. Okay. Okay. Call them one by one. -What's your name? -Mohan, sir. -How much amount do you want? -50,000 rupees. The situation would get serious if you don't pay the interest promptly. If you try to evade, remember, I have all your certificates. Go now. Next. -What's your name? -Chandu. How much amount do you want? 20,000 rupees. What for? Do you want the interest amount or the reasons? I want interest amount. Give the amount and send him away. -Greetings, sir. -How much amount do you want? -50,000 rupees, sir. -What for? My girlfriend told that she was given holidays, sir. She wants us to go to Goa. So, there would be expenses after going there, right? Holidays were given to your girlfriend, but not you. You'd anyway give holidays when we take the amount from you for interest, sir. Oh my goodness! He has striked the right chord. Mr Murthy... Thank you, sir. Madam... [gate creaks] I am Karthik. I know. [clicks tongue] I heard you wanted a club with swimming pool and a gym. I'll show you if you come with me. Yeah. Show it. Ah! [in unison] Good morning, Powerstar. Sit. Stand. Sit. Stand. Sit down. Ah! Where did we conclude our class yesterday? At ambitions topic. Very good! Ambitions. Hmm. Ambition is a very important aspect in life. Everyone should have ambition. Only then we can achieve something in life. India has got 25 percent of youth. We have to motivate them. Hmm... Padma, get up. What is your ambition? I want to pursue PhD in America, sir. Wow! Very good! All the best. Sit. Srinu, get up. What is your ambition? I want to become a sexologist. Oh! Very interesting. Why? I fell in love with three girls, sir. But none of them loved me. Shruti has hit me with her footwear. Agathi has slapped me. But later, when I came to know that Shruti and Tilak had a break-up, I proposed Shruti out of a big heart. But she has bashed me, sir. How is it related to your ambition? So, I will become a doctor. After they get married, they'll get health issues. Then, they will come to me, sir. Then, I'll take them to task, sir. Wow! What a logic! What a logic! Idiot! This can be termed as revenge rather than logic. Sit. Why are you hiding? Get up. What is your ambition? Just like how people adopt children and villages, I want to adopt middle aged women, sir. They have been suffering a lot in dark. Anushka, Sunny Leone and Nayanatara are already suffering so much, sir. You look like a ghost in the dark. And you want to solve their problems. You've been watching YouTube and learning dirty things. Sit. Well... The bulb was invented by Thomas Edison. TV was invented by Farnsworth. Mobile phone was invented by Martin Cooper. They have invented all those, but I am unable to at least know what you are up to My ill-fate! India is one of the most populated countries in the world. And it is in the second position when it comes to intelligence. But why is it so small on a map? Haha... Enlarge the map and that would suffice, sir. Shut up! Stand up! Do you think I don't know about you? What's with the messages on Facebook at night? Ate dinner, darling? Are you sleeping? Take rest, dear... Darling. Sweet dreams, huh? -Why so much affection? -How do you know all these, sir? Of course, I'll know. I'll know everything. Did you ever ask this kind of questions to your parents? What did you message? Don't study much, you'd exhaust. Is it? Do you really feel in that manner? Leave that, sir. But tell me how do you know about these things? Padma, who you are chatting with and has Katrina Kaif as her profile picture, that's me. Sir, this is a big fraud. Shut up! Fraud, my foot! I've created 20 fake profile and chatting, to bust you guys. Oh no! I'd know what nonsense you'd be doing. You don't have any attention towards academics. -[bell rings] -[in unison] Sir... "Hey, she is the beautiful lady... charming pretty beauty" "Hey, look at the beautiful lady... charming pretty beauty" Ow! Wake up, idiot! Go away. Showing some crap. Whoa! -You've ruined my dream. -Freaking dream! Shut it! What is the news? Farmers' hunger deaths. It reminded me of my father. I feel very scared. They might have died due to some different reasons. Don't you worry. You don't know, dude. The situation in my village is very bad. We have to do something. What do you suggest? Idea! We have our heroes who respond whenever there is a problem. [in unison] Yes. Good idea, dude. [rooster crows] What will we do now? The due date to pay the fees for our kid has arrived. As if that is not enough, you took a loan of 50,000 rupees and dug a borewell. And that one isn't working. Now, we have to pay the loan as well. We have a young daughter and we are not serving her proper food. Things won't move if you sit idle. When will government's aid money get credited? They have been saying in a day or two. Well, what have we achieved by depending on agriculture? Except for becoming debt ridden and starving. Listen to me. Let's go to our son's place. Let's do watchman and maid jobs to live. What do you say? [scoffs] What has the state of a farmer has become? He's got 10 acres of farmland and yet, he is in a state to do servant job. The government on one side and the nature on the other side are giving blows, wherein a farmer has become crippled with a broken spine, despite having land. If you don't like my advice, forget it. Seems like what you said might ultimately become true. But I have only one hope that there would be a irrigation-project in our village which would revamp our lives. Why do you bring all those topics now? Do something now and see that you pay our kid's fee. There are approximately 3000 people in the village. They are seeking water from the river Godavari. It costs 200 crores to supply irrigation through reverse pumping project. If we clear their problems as soon they complain, they'd have no work with us and get no votes. Look, if we have to stay in the politics forever, we have to ensure that no problem gets resolved. But anyway, ignorant people would come to me seeking help. And I would say that I'd look into it. Look for yourself to see how I'd with them. [in unison] Greetings, sir. Are you doing good? [in unison] We are doing good, sir. What's the matter? This is the project file of our village. Yes, we'll do it. It will be done. -Hey, take the file. -Here. Seems like you have come here in the sunny weather. There is cold water in the earthen pot outside. Have it and leave. -Sure, sir. -Sure, sir. I'll give this to the minister. Wait downstairs. Okay, sir. VILLAGE PANCHAYAT OFFICE Is the project getting approval? Don't know. But they said that they bring the project. I've been contesting elections from 20 years. They have got me to lose for three times and made me win for only one time. Why would I move things so fast for such villagers? They should see hell-- Please don't kill me. Please don't kill me, sir. Please don't kill me, sir. [groans in pain] [phone rings] Father... How are you doing, son? I am doing good, father. You've told about paying the college fees, haven't you? Don't you worry. I'll send you money by all means necessary. [ox moos] I am in severe crisis, sir. Take this ox and please get me 20,000 rupees. You have pawned gold jewellery and cow. And now you are pawning an ox? What is the problem? We need some money, sir. How much amount? Two lakh rupees, sir. -Do you know the interest amount? -How much, sir? -20,000 rupees. -Per annum, sir? Your grandpa would give such a loan. Get it from him. Sir, I said that ignorantly. 20,000 rupees per month. You should pay the interest promptly even if it takes selling kidneys. Sir, I have a doubt. What if you die due to accident or infected with AIDS? Who should we pay then, sir? Oh, you fatso! Mr Murthy, he's going overboard. Put paper-weight in his mouth. Give them money. If you ever go overboard since I am not taking any surety, remember that I have your certificates. Yes, sir. The torture will be of next level. We won't do that. We'll pay promptly every month. Leave now. Hey, give the amount. Take this. Your college fee is due for this year. Don't delay. Otherwise, Chintu will levy interest on due amount as well. -Yes, dude. -Thanks, dude. Love proposal. How is this? -Madam is arriving. Come here. -Whoa! Come here. Clean the board. Remove your shirt and wipe with it. "Anasuya... Anasuya... Anasuya..."

"All the girls are jealous of your beauty" [phone ringing] Hey, the principal is calling. It is about interest payment. Don't pick the call. Oh man! The phone is ringing continuously. But why aren't they picking? Disconnect the call. Here... Here... Here... Don't pick even if he calls again. [sighs] Is this how your scheme is? I have to think of another scheme for this. Chintu sir... Are you thinking that you are students or something else? You want Vivek, sir? He is here. Just a minute, sir. Why do you say Vivek when I am asking for details? -Hey Vivek -Yes, sir. How was your behaviour when you have taken the money and how is it now? Sir... When will you pay the interest amount? He is there, sir. There? -Sir... -How dare you mess with the principal? Congratulations, sir. What for? You'll not get your certificates. You can go nowhere. You want Karthikeya. He is here, sir. -Talk with him.-Of course, give it the fourth guy. Karthik... Hey fool, speak up. Sir... I'll tear the certificates and put them in Tirupati's donation box. I'll summon your parents. What? Anasuya? Wow! She would be very beautiful, sir. Pay the amount. What sir? Powerstar Pawan Kalyan? Pawan Kalyan? Not him? Who is it then? Robo Rajini, huh? Hey... Sunny Leone? It won't seem nice to talk about her. -You naughty! Sir...-What am I speaking & what are you saying? Sir, I can't hear you properly. No signal.-Loan... -Interest! -We'll talk later. Ah! Sir, you want juice? Juice, my foot! Why aren't you picking my calls? Will you pay interest amount or not? You've been evading classes and hiding away from me. On top of that, you are giving nonsense answers. You have sculpted good body by drinking juices. You have to pay the interest amount of the four months. Come to my room, you've got a special class. The punishment for evading payment of interest amount is, you have to massage my body for one hour every morning and evening. Come on, be on it. Wow! Ah! Massage little harder. -Sir... Sir... -Hey... Hey... Seems like you are a bigger actor than Prakash Raj. Back off... Back off. Well... Turn around. -Sir, we'll touch your feet. -What for? What for? Turn around. Now! Bend. It won't seem good. You've become dirty watching movies. Just bend. More bending. Ouch! Ow! Oh man! -He's got more of it! -Ow! Get interest amount and come to my room. Else, this would get repeated. Damn! Chintu has been harassing us in the name of interest amount. Yes. I am scared to even go to the college. Let's do something. What if we file a police complaint? Let's not do that. It will become a mess. We'll somehow try to convince him. Try calling his phone. -His phone is busy.-[busy dialer tone] Busy? Let's try after one hour. -Still busy, dude.-[busy dialer tone] -He is still busy, dude.-[busy dialer tone] -[busy dialer tone] -Damn! He is still talking to someone. [in unison] Something is wrong. There is a guy to unravel this mystery. -Hi buddy! -Hi... Hi... -Hi dude! -Hi... Hi... -Hi... -What brings you here? -I've got some work with you. -What work? We want a good mobile tapping app, dude. If police come to know about this, they'll smash me. We ensure that you'll not get smashed. I'll give only if you tell me who you are going to tap. My principal. You need to pay some amount to give that app to you. Keep this amount for time being. Here... Make the most out of it. Look... Exercise caution, else everyone would get bashed. Hi sweetheart! Why so late? I am pouting! What can I say, darling? It's getting late by the time I return home after recovering the interest. What are you doing, darling? I am chewing my nails. What about you? Stretching my body. Due to romantic pain? No, out of lust. What dress are you wearing? I am wearing your favourite dress, the half saree. What about you? I am wearing a short. What else? Well... I am wearing just shorts. And nothing else. I didn't mean that. I was asking about the other thing. Oh, that one! The bed here is eagerly waiting for you. Is it? [laughs] Then, why don't you come to my brother and request him to marry us. Whoa! Him? He will kill me if he finds me. Well, I will anyway meet you in the coming two months. [scoffs] Almost everything is over by now. What will be left by that time? I understood you pain, darling. But what can I do? Don't you think I have the pain of not able to marry you even at a late age? Hmm... Shut it and go to sleep. Bye. Sure, darling. Good night. Oh my Chintu! You've been acting like a kid when you have so much flash back story? -What else? -What else? I told you yesterday to clear the stock. What have you been doing? I'll get it arranged now by dividing it into sections. Go now. Sir... What is the matter? Sir... What is the matter? Sir... Did you get the interest amount for yesterday's strike? No, sir. We brought good material. Material? What is it? What are you doing, darling? I am chewing my nails. What about you? -Stretching my body. -Oh man! Due to romantic pain? Seems like they heard our entire phone conversation. What dress are you wearing, darling? Hey, just stop it! You've been telling everything without missing any words. -What the hell have you done? -Forget about what we did. What is Neeraja saying, sir? Hey, his brother would kill me if he comes to know about this. He says he would kill him. Let's cancel our programme. What programme? Well, we thought to tell you the matter and talk the same with her brother. But the situation here seems as if you'd be showering boons to us. Of course. I won't ask you to pay the interest amount from today. What else? You need not pay the interest amount as well. What else? You need not pay the principle amount as well. What else? Well, I'll pay the interest amount to you occasionally. What else? Hey, please don't say 'what else'? It is quite irritating to hear that. Now, our sir fell in line. Buddy, now narrate your hot love story. That's a danger zone. My brother is looking for wedding alliances for me. By any chance, is your brother inside? Hey, I need a prince like groom for my sister. [elevator blips] Go. Does my sister like you? I don't know that but I have been head over heels for her. She is my wife and you are my brother-in-law. -Brother-in-law. -Yes, brother-in-law. First, take a bath in the swimming pool, brother-in-law. After you come from the bath, I'll talk to my sister and fix your wedding. What's with swimming pool? His cholestrol should melt away. [water burbling] Thanks brother-in-law. [water splashes] [screaming in pain] It is hot... It is hot... My body is burning. If anyone comes to my sister seeking marriage, they'd end up like this. From that day, she was staying there and I am staying here. And we've been sharing things over the phone only. Our loves story is 20 years old. [inaudible] Today, I want to tell you a piece of important information. Some lecturers tell it in a way where we would study and some tell it in a way everyone listens. But I'll tell it in an illustrative way which can be taken as an inspiration as well. Of course, a joke repeated for several times would give clarity about it. -[students laughing] -Shut up! I understood. I understood very well. A donkey should be kept in a stable, a dog should be kept at the front yard of the house, and all of you should be kept under control. -Didn't Chintu pay you salary? -Huh! Shut up! Idiot! Since our independence, we have achieved a lot in all the sectors. We have been quickly progressing. But the only person who didn't progress till date is a farmer. To bring permanent solution, he entered politics and trying to bring change like Yogi He is a guide to the next generation. [cheering and applause] He is the commander of every household. He is the greatest soldier of this nation. He is none other than our Powerstar. Hello friend. My dear fellow citizens of India who are walking in the clouds with thundering steps of progress... My dear young soldiers who are seeking for change and new era... Winning or losing aren't important in life. All that matters is the destination. Regardless of hurdles and losing life... My dear next generation of lamps of hope who'd walk along with me... Let's wage a war to end the corruption. Are you ready? This is not the hope of a single person. This is the fight for the welfare of everyone. Students, software engineers and soldiers... Everybody... Everyone of us shall wage a war together for the welfare of farmers. Let's wage a war. Let's wage a war! [in unison] Jai Sena! (Hail soldiers) "Soldiers... Hail soldiers... Soldiers..." "Soldiers... Hail soldiers... Soldiers..." "Soldiers... Hail soldiers... Hail soldiers..." "Jai Sena exemplifies the power of students" "Wage a war... Wage a war... Come on, wage a war" "Wage a war... Wage a war... Come on, wage a war" "If not you, who would carry the mantle" "If not now, when are you take up the charge" "Hey worker, servant of the nation... Come with me" "Hey student, employee...

PAWAN KALYAN FANS OF YOUTH JAI SENA "Jai Sena (Hail people's army)" "Jai Sena (Hail people's army)" "Jai Sena (Hail people's army)" "Jai Sena (Hail people's army)" Our birth should make our mother happy. Our progress should make our father happy. Our way of life should make the society to celebrate. You and your admiration are the reasons that made me a star To server people irrespective of castes, parties I am setting up a helpline. Everyone is a member in this. To help any kind of people and family, I have setup this helpline. And the name of the helpline is Jai Sena. "Jai Sena (Hail people's army)" Parents, you've worked so hard and sent me money to pay my college fees. But I lost all that money in the online Nigerian's scam. I was rusticated from the college for not paying the fees. I have shattered all your hopes on me. I don't have the right to live anymore. Please forgive me. [groans] Big breaking news. Rampant increase of online cheating in the city. A student committed suicide by slitting his throat after getting duped online by the Nigerians. Hey, kill him. [groans] Hey, we pitied you as your nation doesn't provide proper food and having lack of educational opportunities. So we got you admitted in our university with food and accommodation. And you dare to kill our students. Cybercrime can't step in in the place where me and my technology resides. I didn't pay much attention as you are students. If I had focussed... [groans] Someone anonymous has bashed the hell out of the Nigerians. He transferred the amount from their account to the those who got scammed. Who might it be? He got everything done without being in the frame like a gentleman. He seems like a Robinhood. What is the name of the Jai Sena's convener? Granny, wait... -Can we get Kinley water bottles here? -What, son? Kinley... Kinley bottles... Eye tears? Not eye tears, granny. We meant Kinley water bottles. The bottle costs 20 rupees. Do they do business with tears too? They are doing good independent celebrations in villages too. Mrs Annapoorna. -Greetings. -Greetings. Here is the cheque of five lakh rupees. It is the ex-gratia given by the government for your husband's death. See you. Hey, let's ask him. -Sir... -Sir... Why is she weeping over there? Why are they installing flags at every dead farmer's house? On every Independence Day and Republic Day, youth, the government and the rulers display patriotism. After that, it is gone. I am Sriram. I pursued Masters in Computer Science. I do social service to farmers and animals. I am the vice president of Jai Sena helpline. I too have been reminding the government to recognise farming as service to the nation. That's why I am installing our national flag in front of a farmer's house. Well... Who is your favourite cricketer? Sachin, sir. Kohli, sir. Who is your favourite politician? Mr NTR, sir. KCR, sir. -Who is your favourite scientist? -[in unison] Abdul Kalam, sir. -Who is your favourite hero? -[in unison] Pawan Kalyan, sir. -What is your favourite food, sir? -Dum Biryani, sir. -KFC. -Good! Pizza and burger, sir. Organic food, sir. Who is your favourite farmer? [scoffs] You told your favourite things in every sector. But you don't know who has cultivated the food which you eat every day. You don't that farmer. No one can live without food for sure. That's the demand for food. But the farmer and the agriculture are looked upon as outdated. The entire society should be ashamed for such treatment. By buying the adultered seeds and fertilizers in the black market, the crops are not giving a proper yield nor the loans are getting cleared. Due to that several farmers have been committing suicides. Unmoved governments and the leaders are playing politics on our farmers. When the first harvest comes home, it is called Sankranti festival. And such agriculture has been deemed to be waste by so called people. Do you know how much a farmer would sweat to cultivate a crop in one cent of land. Farmers are human machines. If we ignore them, there won't be any single food grain to eat. And we'd get into a situation where we'd be eating imported Chinese plastic rice. A farmer has been existing from history, but can't eat food wholeheartedly till date. He can't wear good clothes, can't afford good education, can't see good future as well. When a farmer is committing suicide and waging war against death, the state and the central government aren't responding. As they are losing their livelihood, the villages are turning into graveyards. Not even a single scientist or an engineer or a politician, have shown them any permanent solution. All of us are killing the farmers. I have ensured that pension is given to several senior citizens, loans to middle class families, scholarships to the students and wished them all the best. But after the farmer's death, I've been handing over ex-gratia to their family, and my heart is unable to take that pain. A mother would give birth. And education will define life. But a farmer is... giving his life for our sake. And this war is for such farmers. I love my India shouldn't be confined to just words, but should be shown in action. There should be a new dawn in the lives of the farmers. The farmer should be made as a powerful person. A farmer should become an employee. There should be days where there would be farming jobs. That's why our Jai Sena helpline would support our farmers. Our leader is considering supporting farmers as service to the nation. His word is [voice muted]. His way is the way of Bhagat Singh. A leader is not confined to telling things. He is the one who guides us in a proper path. We are the servants of the public. Anytime, Jai Sena Helpline. They are commenting on farmer's toil, demeaning their suicides. We have to save our farmers. In a way how salaries are paid to a teacher, doctor, engineer, there should be a day where salaries are paid to farmers as well. We have to somehow teach a lesson to these politicians. A lump of grains of enough to fill this mere stomach. The farmers are committing suicide for this lump of grains but the politicians' desires are knowing no bounds. Neither the politicians nor the society would change. In a way how a lion that developed taste for blood doesn't stop hunting, similarly, these fraudsters who got accustomed to corruption won't change. Is this how politicians would be? They want the contracts and the bribes as well. We should put a full stop for their corruption. Sure. Let's help farmers through Jai Sena helpline. Let commit robbery in the minister's finance company and give his money to him as bribe. What do you say? [birds chirping] Is it 300 or 3 crore rupees that you have asked? Just 3 crores, bro. Do you want me to rob that amount from banks and finance companies? At least, give us your car. My car is under repair. The brakes are loose well. I heard Neeraja's car engine is in good condition. We will go to her and get the car. I told that the brakes were loose, but didn't refuse to give the car to you. Hey... Hey, watchout the secuirty guard. Yes. There is a CC camera. Cover your faces. Ah! The door got locked. Who the hell has locked the door? Switch on the lights. Hey, open the door. Who the hell has locked the door? Hey, open the door. I am talking to you. Who the hell is over there? Someone has come here. They have locked the door intentionally. Hey... [whistling] -Hey, come quickly. -Make it quick. [whistling] Hey, look over there. -There, they are. -They have seen us. -Hey... Faster... -Hey... Stop! Faster... Faster... Hey... Stop! Hey... Stop! -Hey... Stop! -Stop! Hey... Let go of us. Hey... Hey... Stop! -Hey stop... -Stop... Hey... -Come, let's go quickly. -Come on, guys. -Make it fast. -Start it quickly. Hello. Boss, a robbery took place in our finance company. -When? -We lost 3 crores last night, boss. No one should know at any cost that you are my Benami and that money belongs to me. Okay, boss. [phone ringing] -Hello. -What hello? A robbery took place in our finance company. You couldn't catch those robbers till now. What the hell is your department doing? What? If I am in this situation being a minister, imagine public's situation. That's why public speaks ill about the police department. Some officer was transferred to Warangal. What is his name? Devdas. Devdas. Tell your officials to transfer that Devdas to Hyderabad again. -No, sir. -What is your problem? Devdas is a dangerous man. Listen to me, sir. He is a God of death in police uniform, sir. When he finds out about any criminals, he won't sleep until he makes them bite the dust. He wears uniform to perform the encounter act, sir. [gunshots] He knows no mercy, sir. Meddling with him is like playing with fire. That's the kind of person we want. No problem. Summon him. It is my duty to inform you, sir. Hey... Will your husband come to kill me? I have killed him. He has died and became silent. But why have you turned violent and filed a case against me? Huh! I like people with guts. Let's do something together. Huh? [tyres screeches] Why have you applied brakes in that manner? It was obstructing my legs, so I have stomped on it. Regardless of a brake or an accelerator or a criminal that obstructs my legs, I'll stomp! [shatters] Hey... Brandy! It is my brand! Then, let's talk over a drink. The matter would get settled. Devdas, ACP. I thought that my basher has arrived. But how come you are here to booze? Come. Whoa! Are you trying to patronise me? I'll break your bones! [phone ringing] He says he shouldn't be beaten. So, I'll shoot him. [gunshot] My guts would feel bad if I don't hit you. And the gun would feel bad if I don't shoot you. Don't feel bad. [gunshot] [wham] [ringing sound in the ears] Why are staring blank faced? This is point blank. [gunshot] [glass shatters] [Telugu song playing in the background] Would any human let the booze go waste? That's an income for the govenment. [phone ringing] It is tough. He has shattered the bottle. Hello... Hello... I know. I know... I know, man! I know this as well. [gun cocks] Shoot him. As he has killed your husband, so you do the same to him. Shoot him. You don't know about me. -[gunshot] -[screams] You are the wife of a policeman, not an ordinary woman, to get scared. Come on, shoot him. [gunshots] Very good! You have killed a policeman, not an ordinary person. If someone messes with the policeman's family, this is how the punishment would be. Enjoy the death. Sir... Sir... Sir, why are you leaving us behind and going? Not just you, but I am leaving your station as well. I got a transfer. -Sir... Sir... -[tyre screeches] This is the money which was earned by duping the public. They have robbed the entire amount. You weren't able to catch them till now. The name Appaji would send shivers to both the East and the West. I'll catch them in 10 days. Pay me 10 lakhs. Factionism was born in our yard. My men would finish your task. Boss, I am the one who committed murders by informing the police beforehand. But still, they couldn't do anything with me. That's my capacity. I'll take the charge if the police shut their operation. What's this, sir? We will catch them if we are given some time. What the hell would you catch? -What the hell would you catch? -Hey! Why have you started your music without me getting into the action, partner? When you have your eyes on us, we'd be having similar gaze upon all of you guys. Well in our business, we'll instantly identify thief and boss. Heard her? It is better to count on them than you. Well, a policeman lacking form is not worth to wear a uniform. We want to see him strip. [laughing out of mockery] [gunshot] -Hey! -ACP Devdas. Did you come here thinking it is a wine shop? Nice joke! Next, there would be a nice gunfire too. Except policeman's wife, no rogue has the right to touch his uniform. Hey Devdas, I'd have killed you in Bezawada if you hadn't got transferred. Are you feeling bad that you have missed the chance? I have arrived here. Now, I am at point blank-range. Come on, shoot me. Come on, do it. If you commit a mistake, take a dip in River Krishna. It would wash off your sins. If possible, pray to Goddess Durga on the hillock. She would forgive you. But if you mess with Devdas... [gunshots] Why didn't you come across me when I was doing duty at Warangal? You have committed murders by informing the police beforehand. Dangerous! [gunshot] Hey! I missed him in Kurnool. But got him here because of you. As the police couldn't do anything, I took help from the thugs. -Damn! -I am a minister! Hey! I am ACP Devdas. Put faith in the police, not in these fools! Shall we leave, sir? Greetings. Devdas, the encounter specialist got transferred to the city. His name would send chills down the criminals spine. Two D's in Devdas represent dangerous and death. Selfishness, ego, anger and addiction will first spoil us. They would turn us into thieves and criminals. Later, they spoil the society. That's why I wear this uniform to encounter the criminals. Everyone is good natured by birth. I look for any sign of good nature in the criminals. And those lacking that nature have not right to live on the earth. Without even thinking for a second, I'll kill them in an encounter. I've got mad committment. Only a hangman and the policeman in uniform have the right to take out of life. Jai Hind (Long live India) Hey... What if we get caught in the CCTV footage? We have covered our faces with masks, haven't we? If there was any sort of clue that we have left, it would be Chintu's car. Do you think we made any mistake? Definitely! It would come out in enquiry. We have to be careful ensuring that no cues lead to us. Let's attack. [bikes revving] [bottle shatters] [tyres screech] [tyres screech] [tyres screech] [tyres screech] [tyres screech] [tyres screech] Who the hell are you? [muffled breathing] Come on, tell me. You need not untie me. I dare you unmask me. That's enough. Damn! Hey, where are you? I know boozing as well as hacking. Come... Turn around. [laughs mockingly] Hey... If I start studying a case, consider that my gun gets bullet loaded automatically. When that's the case, how dare you mask me by studying me? Having four jokers doesn't mean that it is a show. There should be a life in it. I'll be the one who decides about your life! Hey, what's with this setup? How much longer do you want to keep me here? Until we finish our task. Hey... If I come out, consider that your task to be finished for sure. As if you'd come out at all! -Hey! -[in unison] Relax! [in unison] Relax! [groaning] [in unison] Relax! Hmm... Interesting! You have kidnapped ACP Devdas and shut him down. How to flirt with Preethi? How? How? In this manner. You exist! If it is heads, Preethi is mine. If it is tails... [clicks tongue] I know it would be heads. You exist. Let me try. Oh man! What's this God? Next... Second time. Damn! Go! This is my last time. Damn! First time, it was a single tick. And second time it was a double tick! Won't you give me blue ticks? Damn! Hello. The girl won't fall for you if the outcome is heads. She would fall only if you try to woo her. Preethi... Check your coin idiot. Preethi... "If you say you'd come to my dreams," "I'd be sleeping the entire day" "If you say you'd give me space in your heart" "I'd be indebted to you in my next life as well" "You are the lover who charms me on this earth" "You are the moonlight that glitters in the sky" "You are the body, soul and love, my beloved" "If you say you'd give me space in your heart" "I'd be indebted to you in my next life as well" [music mutes voice] "Oh, the sculpture of a thousand dreams...

Good morning. What are today's appointments? Students have arrived to meet you. [in unison] Greetings, sir. Who are these guys? We came from Devipatnam, sir. Devipatnam project... Well, tell me... Did you come here to talk about that project? The farmers of my village have been meeting you for many days. Please tell us what is the problem, sir. What can I say? There is no budget for it. The state is in debts. Why are you into this work instead of focussing on academics? You said to knock your door whenever any farmer becomes tearful. But it was not tears, but they are losing their lives. Look... No matter how many efforts you put, getting a project to that village is impossible. Afterall it is a village with a population of 3000 people. Who would be spending 200 crores on it and why? Afterall those 3000 people are providing food to 3 crore people, sir. Alright... I won't deny you. Sir, what if we arrange that amount? Hey, I am speaking of 200 crore rupees, not 200 rupees. You'd arrange 200 crore rupees? -Yes, sir. -How? Farmers in that village said that they have sold some of their lands and assets and arranged that money. If you would get us permission... Of course, I can get you a permission. But there is a condition. The contractors and engineers of that project should be from my circle. Are you okay with that? Sir, this is the project which is getting approved after many efforts. For that to last long, the contractor should be honest. Your version is logical. But getting a project is not a simple task. It expects some pocket expenses. How much sir? Two to four crore rupees. Sir, this bag contains 50 lakh rupees. Take this as the token amount, and we'll pay the rest after the opening of the project. Here. Youngsters should be like you. -Thank you, sir. -I am very impressed. Well, how did you get this money? We have already started collecting funds for this project, sir. Good! Very good! I'll send a proposal claiming that the public is building this project. -Okay, sir. Thank you, sir. -You'll get the permission. No problem. Thank you, sir. Who has kidnapped you, sir? Call the fire engine. Why fire engine, sir? [in unison] Relax. Left... Are masks too cheap here? Everyone is using them. Zoom in the number plate. Stop there. Sir... you are making me do your household as well as dirty work for taking a loan from you. Please release me by waiving off my loan. Loan waiver, right? -Yes, sir. -I'll do it. Let's play a game. If you win, I'll waive off the loan. Else, I'll levy interest on that. -Are you okay with it? -Okay. I am a thief and you are a policeman in this game. -Okay. -If you catch me, you'll win the game. -Then, your entire loan will be waived off -Okay, sir. What is my role in this game? Freaking thief, sir. Is he simply saying that or scolding me? Hey... -Close your eyes and start the countdown. -Okay, sir. -Come on, do it. -9, 8, 7 6, 5, 4 Oh man! Why have the police arrived? Who is he? Bullet? If I throw a biscuit at anyone, he should be trapped And if I throw a chocolate, he should be dead. When that's the case, he has sent me a bullet. I should find out who he is. Sir... Hey... Who is this third person of the game? He isn't part of this game. He is a real policeman. -Are you sure? -Sure. You'll be in trouble if you don't believe me, sir. What work would the police have with me? Let me show him who I am. Hey, not just you but I'll waive off loans to all the students. Okay, sir. Ask them to cooperate with me. -Okay, sir. -Go. Students. Present, sir. Oh man! Why have they arrived when I called for students? Students. Hey... I won't let any anti-social work happen in college nor allow strangers. Hey, come here. Come... What are you doing in the college? -You are smoking! You are smoking! Go! -Ow! Ouch! You come here. What should be served in the cafeteria? You don't want tea and coffee? -You want beers? Beers? -Don't hit me, sir. Don't hit me, sir. Beers? Beers? Come on, tell me. Go. Hey... -Sir -Come here. Do you think this college as your den to bring whoever you wish? They came from America, sir. Be it Americans or space people or IAS officers or IPS officers, if they enter the compound without my permission, they'd be whacked. -Will you bring them again? Will you? -Please don't hit me, sir. -Will you? -Why are you hitting like that? He will die. I know administering as well as pampering. Get up. Start the music. [music] This is style! Why have the police arrived? For donations? Hey, get the cheque book. I am not here for a cheque. -Then? -I am here to reap kick. Devdas? The name itself has got kick in it. What brand? Uhuh! I am not here to ask for a brand. I am here to play the band. Just like this. [gunshot] [groans] How come you have killed him, sir? As there is a rampant increase in the crime rate... To bring public awareness I have just encountered him. The public would get scared for your awareness programme. I know doing encounters as well as entertaining people. Start music. Ah! [music] [applause] [gunshot] Is the four wheeler vehicle with registration number AP30 7636 yours? That's mine but it is not a four wheeler, sir. Look, there are two wheels. And two wheels here. Two wheels here and two wheels here. I think you are poor in Math. Ow! Say this nonsense in your house. Do you know that 4 guys who drove your jeep has robbed 3 crore rupees? Sir, some robbers have stolen my jeep recently. Where is it? Did the robbers put it back there? No, sir. They've left it on the road with no fuel. I pushed it and brought back to home. -How are these masks? -Superb, sir. Sir, let me take a selfie wearing this mask. [camera clicks] Along with your selfie, make all your students wear this mask, get their photos and send them to the station. You have to come to the station whenever you are called, until I close this case. What kind of operation is this? This is operation 'crashing speedily'. Sir, I have a doubt. What about the deadbody? He'll get up and leave. Come on, boys. He'll get up and leave? [in unison] Greetings, sir. Save it for later. I expected you to come with sacks of money but you are here empty-handed. Where is the amount? As it is a huge account, I want to put it in the bank account. Give our sir's bank account number. Okay, sir. Here is your permission file. Give this to them. Are you happy? We'll fix the opening day on an auspicious date. You have to attend without fail. I am very fond of opening ceremonies and meetings. [in unison] Thank you, sir. -First, put the amount in the account. -[in unison] We'll definitely. -Go. -See you, sir. -Mr Rambabu -Sit down... Your majesty, -Sit down, sir. -Sit down. Wow! Sir, God won't come from someplace to do good. He comes in the form of a nice person like you. You are God! Have it, sir. You too have it. -Cheers! -Cheers! You said you'd help me. -Yes, sir. -And you did it. Tell me what help should I do for you. Tell me about your boss, sir. Him? There is no other cunning fraudster other than him in this world. What might be minister's worth? He's got some hundreds of crores. That means he is so rich! Everything is on Benami's name. Not a rupee is on his name. Shall I tell you an actual matter? He's got so many unofficial accounts... Oh man! Your majesty, tell me their names and I will pay you 10 lakhs. 10 lakhs! There is an account on his brother-in-law, Kalasam Reddy's name. There is an account on his keep, Tara Reddy Sri's name There is an account on his Geddapu Dasarath' name. He didn't leave my name. He opened an account on my name as well. Well, why are you asking all these questions? Just for general knowledge, sir. If we earn so much money in the future, we should know how to hide them. You'd take me as your PA, right? Sir, you are our visible God. God, sir. Those account numbers... Account number? I will give. Have them. Come on, sir. You've been saying the same dialogue. Will there be any new answer no matter how many times you ask the same question? Of course, it will come now. Hey, get him on board. I think it is too bold. Anyhow, you might've started new traditions in your station. Show me. Come on, get me on board. Lie down here. Lie down? You've told that you'd get me on board, haven't you? Just lie down. Don't change your words. I won't lie down. You've told that you'd get me on board, haven't you? I won't lie down. Whoa! Sir... Sir... Put it down. Put it down. I will lie down. Ah! It seems like a bed thought it isn't one. Chintu, where are you looking at? Where would youngster's eyes look at, sir? You are talking so dirty. Of course, that what youngsters do. Start the pestle treatment. Why a pestle, sir? Tie him. Sir... Sir... Tell him to stop. Ow! You freaking people! Sir... Ouch! My things are getting smashed! Sir... Sir... Tell him to stop. Tell him to stop, sir. Sir... Ouch! -Tell him to stop, sir. Sir... -Stop it. Untie him. Ouch! Oh man! 202 come aside. Walk now. What's this rehearsal for? To make you regain your thing. Re... Chintu... why is there no change in your voice and body... Ow! Please remove your hand, sir. -It means, he needs another round. -Let's go. [sighs] Ow! Stop. Seems like the oldie might die. Ow! Calling me oldie will hurt my sentiments. -Ow! -Look Chintu... You'll go home for now. If you don't tell the truth tomorrow, the pestle will pierce in another direction. Hi darling. Why aren't you calling at all these days? What can I say? Four rogues have tapped our phones and been blackmailing to tell to your brother. Moreover, they took my car, committed robbed and got trapped in a case. The CI has been bashing me despite knowing my background. I am sharing this only with you as I couldn't share with anyone else. Poor you! -Shall we get into the business? -Have you got energy? What for? Excuse me. What do you do? I direct short films, sir. -What about you? -Stand up comedian. Oh! -What about you? -DOP, sir. -What does it mean? -He means cameraman. Oh! I work as a hero. Hero? Oh! It means you are from the film industry. Come, let's have a selfie. Why are you feeling tensed up? Come on, give a pose. Smile. Let's meet in the future. [phone rings] -Hello. -Hey Chinnu, will you come? Oh man! She's talking so boldly. Hey, you are woman constable. You shouldn't talk like that. I am busy. I won't come. Alright, we'll come. Why take so risk? I'll come there. Excuse me, sir. [in unison] Greetings, sir. I'll call you back. -You are... -We are agricultural college students. You came once to our college fest too, sir. Hmm. What brings you here? Sir, you need to hack an account. -What are you talking? -Sir... Sir... Please, sir. I am from Devipatnam. There are 50 villages around it. People there are committing suicides due to lack of water and crop-yield. If the lift irrigation project gets completed, several farmers' lives will be revamped. There are many people dying like my father. Please save the lives of farmers. Mother Earth... Goddess Earth.. What sin have we committed? Is putting faith in you was the sin we have committed? Why are we the only people undergoing these sufferings? Even God doesn't have mercy on us to bring us out of this sufferings. Do farmers have to die like this, mother? "Farmer is the vermillion on the forehead of a mother" "He is the king who cultivates golden food grains" "Farmer is the vermillion on the forehead of a mother" "He is the king who cultivates golden food grains" "Farmer is suffering eagerly waiting for clouds" "The farmer who puts all his faith in the soil is ultimately ending up in the soil" "Farmers' lives have been written with tears" "The glory of the village is turning into a graveyard" "Oh God! Please save" "Save farmers from committing suicides" "Oh God! Please save" "Save farmers from committing suicides" Oh! [weeping] Father... Father... Father... Father... Father... "A farmer is the elder son of the nation" "He's been hailed as Jai Kisan by the nation" "You exist in green colour" "on the waving national flag" "When the farmer dies out of heartbreak" "will the government's aid reach them?" "Oh God! Please save" "Save farmers from committing suicides" "Oh God! Please save" "Save farmers from committing suicides" [gunshots] Hello brother. Our father is no more, brother. [unclear voices] -What happened? -Nothing. Just a small headache. Are you sure? Else tell me, we shall get our exams cancelled. Of course, exam is a headache. [weeping] Hey, what happened? Tell us what happened. My father has passed away. Why didn't you tell us? I didn't say because it would ruin the exam atmosphere. What, man? -Let's go. -Let's go. [music mutes voice] Study well. -Don't quarrel with anyone. -Okay, father. Where are you going? To Hyderabad, uncle. I'm getting him educated for the development of our village but not for money. How did this happen? Balayya committed suicide due burden of debts. so that government would give five lakh rupees ex-gratia. He committed suicide for the sake of money. I fear how many farmers would be destroyed before this project kickstarts. Let's go. Don't forget to eat food by focussing on education. Be careful. -Put your tickets carefully. -Okay, father. Father... Look, your father has left us by doing injustice. Father... Why did you do so? Why did you do so? Father, get up... Father, get up. Hey, look at my father. Father, get up. Mother, ask father to get up. Father, get up. Mother, how did father die? [thunders rumbling] [groans] Did you come home drunk? Where is the money that came by selling an ox? Have you spent them? Have you got drunk with that money? You should have bought us some poison as well. I and our daughter would have drunk it and died. Then, you would have happily got drunk in this house. Damn you! Aren't you ashamed? There are no food grains in the house. We don't know the future. Plus, we are full of debts. Despite all these, you have come home drunk? Are you even a human? When I ask to leave this village, you'd say some moral crap citing you are a farmer, the backbone of this nation. Look, I can't bear you anymore. I can't take this. I and my daughter will go to my son's place. Whether you want to live or die hanging, it is up to you. Yes, I came home drunk. But it was a pesticide that I have drunk. -Father... -What did you say? What did you say? Unless I have 2000 rupees, not even death is not coming this mad farmer. I was told that the amount for selling ox would be given tomorrow. [gasps noisly] Why did you do so? Go and take the amount. Why did you do so? You are right. You and daughter can live happily with the son. What are these terrible words? All these days, I have expected that the project would come and our lives would get better. And it remained as a dream. What did you say earlier? You said you'd die. What will you get if you die? But if I die... the government would give five lakh rupees citing farmer's suicide. Take that amount and go to son's place along with her. Why do you talk of all that now? Come, let's go to hospital. [gasps noisly] Please someone come here. Hey... Oh my God! [sobbing] [sobbing] Vivek, not just your father but the situation of every farmer in this village is the same. Uncle, where do they want to build the project? Come with me, I'll show you. We have been putting many efforts for Devipatnam lift irrigation project. If this project comes here, farmers from 80 villages around here will get benefitted. And hundreds of families will prosper. But why aren't doing this project? We have sent many requests and met many leaders. Leaders are coming and going. But none of them is bothering about this. Then, how will this problem gets solved? Many big engineers have surveyed and told that it can be done by getting the water from low lying area to high ground. This village is 500 metres high and 3 kilometres far from our village. If we are able to draw this water to our village, we can supply water to 50 villages along with ours. As per the survey that I have done, the land is above 120 feet high from the Godavari river water level. There is no chance that water can go that high. So, as lift and pour scheme, with the reverse water pumping process, we can get the water from low lying area to high ground. It costs almost more than 200 crore rupees. If we are able to irrigate water to drylands through canals, those lands will turn into lush green farms. Not that just, farmers from around 80 villages will get better. Suicide shouldn't become farmers' inheriting thing. And corruption should become like citizenship to the politicians. It has to be fought. Not just you, me and we. All the people should fight. The focus which media gives to celebrities is being denied to farmers. When a cricket match gets cancelled due to rain, people feel sad about their favourite cricketer missing hitting a century. But when a farmer dies untimely due to no rain, there is a dearth of responding hearts. For the first time, I've been seeing that in you. Seeing your aggression, I feel that you'll achieve for sure. Tell me what to do. You were the one who suggested to use the technology for a good purpose. For that, we have designed a hacking device. But we were unable to finish it, sir. I will make it successful. With the hacking software that I have invented, when there is a transfer of amount from one's account to another, not even the bank sector can find it. As your motive is good, I've joined hands with you. A farmer should live happily. Success! -Yes! -Yes! -Handle it very carefully. -Okay, sir. Make a promise that you wouldn't misuse this. -Take it. All the best. -Thank you, sir. Go. Tell the account number. -800 -800 -823 -823 -41 -41 -72 -72 -81 -81 -Yes! -The account became accessible. Yes! -ULPFA bank? -ULPFA bank? Hey, ULPHA belongs to Gujarat. What's with them? They used this bank with a purpose of not making people know about it. ULPFA Check the balance amount. -35 crores! -35 crores! They are citing projects and stealing the funds. Hey, check the next account. -21 -21 -31 -31 -41 -41 -22 -22 I wonder how much this account contains. Who knows? [unclear voice] [unclear voice] -Glory bank? -What's with the name Glory bank? [in unison] 25 crores! Hey, they are stealing from the public as well as the nation. Hey, tell the next bank account number. Total of 200 crores. Hey Election Reddy, from today, your connection will be severed. Go to the village immediately and get the account numbers of the farmers. Hey, tell the account numbers of our farmers. Mallikarjun. -32 -32 -36 -36 -37 -37 -31 -31 -46 -46 How much amount should I transfer? Make it around 20 to 40 lakhs. -Yes -Yes! -Yes -Yes! Did you receive a message to your phone, uncle? Yes, dear. Uncle, this money is for the irrigation project of our village. I am transferring the amount to all our people. [in unison] Yeah! [celebrating] -Hi brother -Hi brother Why are there only two of you? They went out, brother. Brother, whatever we thought will become reality for sure. Hundred percent success. The money has been transferred to all the accounts. Very good! We are building the project, brother. -Sir. -What is it? Did you draw a large amount from the bank accounts? No. Why? What happened? -All the accounts are showing nil balance. -[exclaims] Hey... What are you talking? Yes, sir. All the accounts are showing nil balance. "Suicide is never a solution" "Sustain and fight by mustering the courage" "Farmer's plough is asking to wage a war" And farmer's fist is tightening claiming it is ready" "Oh farmer, you shall prosper" "India is your parental home" "Oh farmer, you shall prosper" "India is your parental home" [music mutes voice] Damn! My 200 crore rupees in my unofficial accounts are gone. We couldn't know who those robbers were. How did they come to know about the illegal Indore and Gwalior accounts? Don't know, boss. Someone might have done this purposefully. Hey! Go and find out who they are. Sure, boss. Oh no! Give me the phone. What did you do that the phone got locked? Excuse me. The phone got locked. Can you please look into it? What's with this phone, madam? Don't you know you shouldn't give phones to kids? Take it. What did you do? Give it here, madam. Here, look at it now. Thank you, sir. You are welcome. I tried so many ways but it didn't get unlocked. But how did you unlock it so instantly? That's my talent. I forgot my bank account's password. Can you unlock it? Go to the bank and they will give the password. My branch is not in this city. You have to go no matter wherever it is. You are too straight forward. What do you do? When a computer gets damaged, I'd repair them. I didn't understand. I protect computers from viruses. Oh! What do you do? I too regularly clean the virus in the society. Really? Yes, it is real. In a way how wrong it is to give a phone to the kids, similarly, it is wrong to keep a gun in the public without properly locking it. Everyone uses a phone. Knowing about unlocking is not a big deal. But either a policeman like me or a criminal would handle guns, then, how do you know about this lock? Some guy posted a video of a gun named 'Tick Tick Tick' on Tick Tock. Tick Tock? I won't waste my time on those things. Anyway, I like your talent. Can we have one selfie? Sure. Smile. Sit down. -Coffee? -I want tea. -Saleem Bhai.-Yes, brother. Get a cup of tea and I want a Nine-tea. Okay, brother. Here. Alcohol? Watchers would think it is green tea. -Are you on duty? -No, I am off-duty. What about gun? This saves people when I am on duty. And when I am off-duty, it saves me from the criminals. This gets a holiday whenever the bullets are over. So, it means your gun does more duty than you. Anyways, thanks for the tea. By the way, can I upload our selfie? No need. Whenever an internet linked camera or mobile takes or shares my photo, it'll get automatically uploaded on my device. Thomas, I'll send a guys photo. I need his complete details. Crap! These people have been your Benamis for many years. Was there any rupee miscalculation ever? Why would there be any? Because they are here to rob some crores at once. Come on, brother-in-law. It was done through net banking. Didn't understand? A click is transferring crores of money in someone's account. There is a rampant increase in online frauds nowadays. Online fraud? Yes, brother-in-law. Robbing from the accounts of us three who are your Benamis, means it is the work of the familiar persons. It might the work of the professional software guys. Get all the software engineers in the city to here. [bashing sounds] Keep bashing all of them unless they tell the truth. Don't spare them until they tell about the robbers of our money. Hey... Keep whacking them unless they give the names of the hackers. Spare no one. How dare you bite me? I'll bite you. I'll bite you. Ow! Whoa! Ouch! Sir, I beg you. Ask them to stop bashing us. I am peeing in my pants. Hey, stop it. Tell the truth or I'll kill you and bury here. Tell me. I will tell you. Sir... Sir... Four guys came to me. We came again to advance a little more. Afterall... When those agricultural students told they were collecting 200 crores, I didn't suspect them. [music mutes voice] I didn't expect at least when they have called me for the project opening. [music mutes voice] There is a saying that a mouse was showing some body part to a blind cat. They made me a blind cat in this game. I couldn't find their motive. Farmers from the villages around Devipatnam have been committing suicide from few years. With an aim to self motivate farmers and prevent them from committing suicides, Powerstar Jai Sena's helpline has helped the farmers to build the lift irrigation project on their own. It has filled happiness in the families of farmers from 50 villages. Jai Kisan. Jai Sena. [music mutes voice] [music mutes voice] [people cheering] Greetings. -Hey... -Yes, boss. We found out who robbed our money by hacking our accounts. Show hell to each one of them. [siren wailing] Come, let's run away. Run to that side. Hey... Stop! Ambulance. [tyres screech] [siren wailing] [groaning] What's this? Take me to the hospital. Seems like I will die. Board it. Lie down. Driver, make it fast. [groaning] Ask the driver to drive faster. Hey... Come... Come... Oh! What happened? Problem solved. Good ambulance. Here, take this. What are you staring at? Kill him. Let's run away. They shouldn't get caught by the police under any circumstances. Our secrets will become public. They are in the college. Chop them into pieces. I'll take care of the rest. They are over there. Turn the vehicle. [tyres screech] Keep driving... Hey stop! Keep driving... Faster... Faster... Keep driving... Hey... Police are over there. What do we do now? Hey, come here. Keep driving... Hey, start the vehicle. Come on. Hello... Rajanna's men are chasing the college guys. Handle their men. And I will handle Rajanna. Okay, sir. [tyres screech] Stop! Faster... We should catch them. Come... Come... [people protesting] Faster... Faster... [tyres screech] Keep going. [people protesting] Hey, you are working against my boss. Go away from here. [people protesting] Faster... He won't listen. Pour petrol and burn his vehicle. [people protesting] [people protesting] Police, down down! Hey, you work against my boss. Go back. I am talking to you. [gunshot] [chaos] [gunshot] [gunshot] [gunshots] [gunshot] [gunshot] They said they'd sacrifice their lives for you. So, I tested whether it was true or not. It was true indeed. I've seen blood donors and eye donors. But for the first time I am seeing life donors. Nice catch! Hey! What do you want? -Lives. -Huh? Don't worry. I need those four youngsters to be alive. Call immediately and tell them to let go of them. What will you do if I don't say so? Hey... Catch them... Don't spare those rogue. Just catch them. Hey... Hey... Stop... After all you are a leader, you won't die alone. Tell me how many people you want with you. I'll send the entire convoy. Hey... Hey... Hey... Stop... Stop... Hey... Stop... [gunshot] How come you are shooting like that? [overlap of voices] How long will you just hear the word 'hail'? Just listen to the word Amar Rahe (long live) too. It'll be soothing. Stop! Hey, where will you escape? Chop these rogues. Tell me... Will you spare those four youngsters or your life? Just a minute. I'll call them. Tell me, brother-in-law. Let go of those four students. Ah! Just let go them! What happened? Listen to me, else you'll die. Damn! Let go of them. Hey... If you step forward, I'll shoot you. Hey... Hey... Come with us. -I won't spare you for sparing them. -[exclaims] If I have to spare you, you'll have to let go of many things. If you remain incorrigible, I'll start my thing again and fill the entire magazine in your body. Hey, do you know why I have let you alive? You have to see their victory, there should be good crop yield, and the farmer shall live and prosper. Only when a farmer lays his hands in the soil, we'd have food. You have to reform before I get transferred to another place. If you reform, there would be celebrations. Else, there would be shootout. Hey, who the hell has tied me? Please let go of me. I beg you. Please... Who are you? Please... Why are you getting nervous? You shouldn't. Relax! Relax! Relax! Relax! Have you thought that I won't find out who you are? Hey... relax! Relax! If I get caught by the criminals, they would kill me immediately. No doubt! But you have masked me. That was my doubt. Something is behind you. To know that, we watched your every movement. What? Don't you want to believe that? When we saw you for the first time in the college, we suspected you. Since then, you've been under our surveillance at every place your visit including your home and college. Youngsters of your age should garner likes on Facebook but not get bashed on your bashes. When you find a friend, you have to visit a pub. When you find a [muted] friend, you have to visit a park. But why are you roaming around the fields with farmers? Hey... Everyone is trying to settle in America. But you guys want to see a farmer get settled peacefully. I know how you have siphoned off money through hacking technique, how much amount, who you have helped and I even know who helped you. Whenever I see a bad person, I'd turn mad. But I'd become a devotee when I see a good person. I like your job. Thank you, sir. I chased to catch you not for arresting you, but to save you from the minister who was trying to kill you. I went to your village, talked with the farmers and got to know about your project. I liked your resolution. Yes. Komaram Bheem project should be completed, farms should get irrigated, and the lives of farmers should get better. Yes. The farmer should prosper. But what you did was not a small crime. We have to respect the law. Listen to me and surrender to the court. I'll ensure that justice is served to you. Sir, I alone did all this. These guys have no link to the case at all. Sir, please produce only me before the court. Please sir... Please sir... Hey! What are you talking? Hey, our upbringing was together, we roamed together and studied together. Whose welfare did we do all this for? We did this for the welfare of the farmers. Whatever might be the punishment, let us face it together. [in unison] Yes. We won't accept you to suffer alone. If you have any respect for our friendship, make a promise that you won't defy me. Darn! When a good friend is with us, we can win over the world. It is my responsibilty to protect you because I'm also the son of a farmer. [in unison] Sir... Hey, you have to kill that ACP by all means necessary. He killed our 15 men in front of me. He shouldn't be alive. [gunfire] [engine starts] Breaking news. We have just received it. Some unknown assailants have brutally shot and killed ACP Devdas. The autopsy report confirmed that his body was pierced by 30 bullets. Sorry, sir. I don't have faith in all these. I swear on my dead father and my mother who is over there that I will tell the truth. -What is your name? -Vivek. -What are you pursuing? -Agriculture Engineering, sir. How come you wanted to commit a robbery despite you are a college student? Sir... Nowadays, scams, kidnaps and robberies are being committed by those who are well educated than me. They are those who are in higher positions. But they are sitting on a chair of corruption, but I am standing in the middle of the road named moral. How dare you talk about moral and corruption? The law won't spare you. What you said is hundred percent correct, sir. This law which can do nothing about those big politicians who betrayed the voters with their promises... This law which can do nothing about those biggies who have done lakhs of crores worth scams... This law which can do nothing about those who did fodder scam, coal scam and 2G scam despite knowing who they are... won't spare me at all. Because I am a common man, sir. You are insulting the judicial system. All those cases are under hearing. Presently, if there is a case under hearing or under a committe, consider that the case is closed. I am not telling this, sir. People outside are saying this. [applause and whistles] Order! Order! It is of no use to argue with you. This place itself is meant for arguement, right sir? You are talking so cleverly. Then, why have you committed a robbery? Of course, I will tell you, sir. But before that, consider this as my demand or request, I'll tell you everything only if you summon a person here, sir. -Who is that? -Election Reddy, the Irrigation Minister. Is he linked to this case? That is the very reason I asked, sir. The court is adjourned. Greetings Your Honour. What is it sir? Should you be doing this? You take the name of law if I question you. I'm too busy in the service of people. [scoffs] Just because someone said something... you summoned a people's representative to court. Is this righteous? Vivek, come to the point. Who is the king of our country, sir? Can I say it, sir? The farmer who gives us food is the king. [crowd applause] Order! Order! My father is a farmer, sir. I have done this for many farmers like my father. For the farmers? Yes, sir. Once upon a time, farmer fed the entire nation. But now, the very farmer is suffering with hunger. Unable to get a loan, troubled by hunger and unable to kill their hearts and beg... there are many farmers in this state who end up dying. Can you believe it, sir? A farmer is denied a loan of 2 lakhs even after tiresome repeated trials to a bank, but when the same farmer commits suicide... a copious amount of 5 lakhs is is sent right to his home as ex-gratia, sir. Finally, a farmer is brought to a situation... where he gives up his life for the sake of the ex-gratia given by the government. This is what's happening, sir! The farmer's house which was abundant with cattle and crop earlier... has neither cattle nor any crop, sir. It's filled with suicides and people crying, sir. At last, when the farmer who feeds the nation dies... their families are in a position where they can't afford even his last rites. I'm saying this with the pain of losing my father, sir. At present, the villages are suffering badly due to hunger, burden of loans... ruined lives and that's a truth, sir. Who is responsible for all of this? This Minister. Their government and their way of functioning. Do you have any proofs for your allegation? We do have them, sir. Gautham! Our target is to save every farmer from suicide and hunger deaths. If any farmer seeks my help, I'm ready to help them even by selling my property. Sir, this speech makes us think that this man could be the next Gandhi. We've got another video. Abhi... The contractors and engineers of that project would be our people. We have to offer them something and get a permission. This involves some money. Some two to four crores. This is the real character of this respected person, sir. They are corrupt and need commissions. They are committing a mistake, and every politicial is this way, sir. Which means, they don't need people, they just need votes, sir. They just need power. They can to any lengths for the sake of votes, sir. Not just that, sir. There is something else. They give everything free of cost in the name of Welfare schemes. Who asked them to give anything for free, sir? Do public look like beggars to take from them? They release a manifesto but show no solution to the farmer who feeds us. No one shows a lifelong solution to a farmer's problem, sir. These leaders are incapable, sir! They are all thieves! I understand the problem. But what have you done? I did, sir. I stopped the suicides of the farmers in my village. I transformed my famine-hit village into green fields. We completed a project which would take years, in just ten months. I did this even after I knew I'm spoiling my life, sir. We have completed the Komaram Bheem project to make farmers' lives better. Where did you get that kind of money from? Pawan Kalyan, Mahesh Babu, NTR and Prabhas gave a donation of 50 crores each, sir. No Your Honour. All of this is a lie! He is absolutely lying! That is all my money. He stole it from my account without my knowledge. Yes, sir. I stole the money. But let's first ask the Minister where did he get so much amount from? If that was hard earned money, he would have lodged a complaint, sir. Why didn't he do that, sir? Because that's money earnt from corruption. He showed 5000 rupees in the election affidavit and hid billions in an old bag. Order a CBI enquiry on this, sir. The truth would be exposed. Whatever it is, but you committed a crime. I have done injustice to the politicians in the course of doing justice to farmers. I will happily abide by whatever punishment you give me for that, sir. After examining the complete details of this case... I pronounce four years of ordinary imprisonment to the accussed, Vivek. And for having illegal assets... I order a CBI investigation on Minister, Election Reddy. AFTER FOUR YEARS OF IMPRISONMENT Where is he? Come on tell me! -Hey! -[men groaning] I'll leave you in a decent manner if you tell me where your friend is. Else I'll kill you cruelly! Hello! Who the hell are you? I'm Godse. Godse? Why do you have the name after the one who killed Gandhi? Gandhi was a patriot and so was Godse. Where the hell did you come from? From Ayodhya. I'm here dedicatedly to ask you for donation. Why do you need that for? To build Rama's temple in Ayodhya. You name depicts villianism but your deeds depict heroism. [scoffs] They simply don't match! You should have been in the Assembly. But you are in a forest now. They simply don't match either! Building Rama's temple in Ayodhya is impossible. Modi would take care of the terrorists. And I'll take care of you. Yeah, let's come to that later. But who told you that I'd give a donation? This guy? This guy said rowdies are usually rash and politicians have good cash and got me here Give me and I'll leave. They robbed me of billions and got you here for donation? You robbed it from the people and they robbed it from you. There is nothing wrong in it! WHy are we talking to him, boss? Hey! [man groans] Why are you getting worked up when I'm talking about donation? [man groans] Look Mr. Minister! Leave them now. Leave them, my foot! These idiots robbed me of all my years of Political respect, power and money! And you ask me to leave them? Everyone remembers to eat thrice a day. But no one wishes for the well-being of the farmers who grow crops. Do you know how many farmers committed suicide because of you? Every hour, one farmer is committing suicide in India. 15 lakh farmers are leaving their occupation. They have finished you responsibility as a people's representative. So, I'm asking to leave them at once. Else, it's just war! Ready for it? Everyone! Kill him! [groaning in pain] [Minister groaning] [iron rod clinks] [roaring] Thank you for saving us, sir. You completed the project using updated technology... and brought back past glory to your village. You are an icon to youth. You proved that social service is also important apart from education. Don't use the technology meant to do good for doing bad things. -OK? -[all] OK, sir. -Good luck. -[all] Thank you, sir. Namasthe. This is our Jaya Sena manifesto. Entire India should unite to fight for it. No.1... Farming should be recognized as service to nation. No. 2... If any farmer passes away... he should be given a guard of honour in the Mandal. No. 3... Farmers' Day should be declared as a National holiday. Every crop should have it's fixed Minimum Sale Price. Crop insurance scheme should be implemented. Only government should supply seeds. Government should take the responsibility to eradicate supply of duplicate seeds. First citizen of our country is the President. First citizen of a Corporation is the Mayor. First citizen of a State is the Governor. Similarly, every village should recognize the senior farmer as it's First Citizen. We need a National Book. Corruption has increased a lot in our country. Our Constitution was corrected 96 times. Not even one time it was to eradicate corruption. There should be a 97th correction for that reason. Recall system should be introduced. Which means, if the leader commits a mistake, people can cease power from him. Every person's Birth Certificate... ...should classify him only as an Indian and not by his caste or religion. The government should take responsibility of the top rankers in our country... and train them to become great Indian achievers. Just like IAS and IPS... there should be an IES, Indian Educational Service. Both education and health should be under the control of the Government. Privatization should be abolished. Income tax laws sould be changed. Only 10percent of people are paying tax. There should be no tax till 5 lakhs of income. There should be free education from LKG to Diploma or Bachelors Degree, Private schools should be linked to it. Students from Government schools should have first priority in Government jobs. There is a retirement procedure in every sector in the world. Why is it not implemented in the case of politicians? There should be no political heir. Correction of the Constitution is a great task which is a revolution. That is our Final destination. Our India is in grave danger. Save it!
