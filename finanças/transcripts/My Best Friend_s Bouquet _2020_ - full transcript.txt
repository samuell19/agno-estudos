That's good. ♪ You've got me singing, Ohhhhh ♪ ♪ Oh, you've got me screaming ♪ ♪ Ohhhhh ♪ ♪ Oh, you got me singing ♪ ♪ Ohhhhh ♪ You look good holding that. Oh, well maybe one of these days it'll be mine. Hey. Just in time to carry some boxes. Oh, sorry, precious cargo. But I am great at supervising. Well played. Thank you. Athena, how's that fruit coming? Already worked my magic. And prepare to be dazzled by my secret recipe, frittatas. You guys are the best. Thank you so much for helping me pull this off. Oh, Brian does all the real cooking in our relationship. I merely assemble. How'd the final tux fitting go? Well, the plan is to pick them up on Friday, but here's the thing. I really like scones, so it's very possible that I'm going to have to go up a couple sizes. Sorry. Don't forget to book a haircut. I'm going out Friday with Alex. Prepare for the most handsome groomsman ever. Help me take all this food outside? Yeah. Ok. How much stuff does Ted have? My husband-to-be owns a vintage turntable and a vinyl collection, which means music for every moment, but no more closet space. Any thoughts on what's next now that you left the bank? Not yet. Wedding planning's been keeping me busy. And happy. I want a career that will let me have a life like this. No more boardrooms. I'll figure out my big passion project after the honeymoon. Some fancy shoes for brunch. I'm breaking in my bridal shoes. All the advice books say to do it. You are the most together and well-prepared bride I've ever met in my entire life. - Hi. - Hi! Hey. More records? I'm only halfway through jazz. I'm kidding, it's just my ski stuff. Aw, Josie. It's perfect. Practice pays off. She has been honing her bouquet skills long before you got engaged. It's a Hughes family tradition. Handmade bouquets made with love. I always imagined I'd make my best friends' bouquets. Red roses. You remembered that Ted brought me these on our first date. I'm classy like that. One rose for every month you've been engaged, intertwined with your birth flowers. And that ribbon binding it together? That is leftover silk from your dress. I wanted it to tell your love story. It does. And whoever catches it at your wedding is the next to get married. Sit, sit. Let's eat. Thank you so much, guys. This looks amazing. It does. - Coffee? - Yes. Here you go. Thank you. So, how did the Hughes family get into the bouquet biz? Less biz, more beloved hobby. Still, the lore of the bouquet runs deep in Josie's family. Lore? Bouquets have lore? Wait, you haven't heard the story? I've told it a million times. Well, to be fair, I'm usually busy cooking or eating, and I wasn't boyfriended into this group until what, two years ago? Mmmhmm. Tell it again. It always gives me goosebumps. Aunt Susan, my dad's sister, made her own wedding bouquet. I even got to help. I was eight years old, and I was a flower girl. Their other sister, my aunt Amy, was the Maid of Honour. Now I remember Aunt Amy was sad that day. Turns out, she had a long-distance boyfriend who she'd hoped would be her date to the wedding. But... He disappeared. Like what, he went missing or something? Later, at the reception, it was time to catch the bouquet. Now, one cousin was already engaged so everybody was laying odds that she'd catch it. But... Aunt Amy caught it instead. The one with the disappeared date. Thanks. Right. Everyone was shocked, no one more than Aunt Amy. But Aunt Susan wasn't. The bouquet knows where to go. It finds who it's meant to find. This next part's the best. Okay, enough dramatic pausing. What... what happened? Turns out he hadn't disappeared. He'd been in a serious bike accident. He was hospitalized. Remember, this was pre-texting era. Okay. So, Aunt Amy only found out the day after the wedding. She rushes to be by his side. A few short weeks later they were married, and they recently celebrated their 20th wedding anniversary. See, legit goosebumps. The bouquet knows. So you really believe that whoever catches the bouquet is somehow, what, next in line to be married? No matter what? It finds who it's meant to find. We have seen it in action. My old boss got married after catching the bouquet at a wedding she was dragged to last year. Could be a coincidence. Or destiny. This girl we know from college, Nicole, recently got engaged. I called her to congratulate her. Guess what she recently caught? Okay, okay. I surrender. I believe, I believe. Just an FYI about the seating chart. Ooh, please say that Alex and I are table buddies. We were planning on seating you apart. What? Okay, why are you punishing us? No, no. It's not punishment. It's an opportunity. It might be nice for you two to mingle. Meet some singles. Okay, when is the last time either of you went on a date? - Um... - Um... - Um... You... you know... - February. December. Decembruary. - Decembruary. - Decembruary. Decembruary is not a month. I've been slammed at work. And I'm taking a break from dating. I keep getting my hopes up, and then it doesn't work out. It's disheartening. It might be disheartening because you overthink everything. Josie, you're always waiting for some romantic sign that you've finally found Mr. Perfect. I mean, you guys have all found The One. Your once-in-a-lifetime love. I just want that same thing. And still, Mr. Perfect. That's a lot of pressure for a guy. And I know, because I am one. I just want it to happen like it does in the movies. You know, this romantic moment scripted by fate. They bump into each other and voila, they just know they found their person. It might be a tall order. I don't know. Took me three and a half months to convince Athena to date me, right? I think I'll know it the moment it happens. Anyone feel like helping with the last load from my car? Oh, you bet. Brian will lift and I'll supervise. Oh wait. Where are my... Sunglasses? Kitchen counter. Probably, yes. I will be back. So, uh, Alex. How long have you been in love with Josie? Am I that easy to read? Only to me. Why haven't you told her? She's my best friend and my... I don't think I should risk ruining that. And then there's Chicago to consider. Chicago, what's in Chicago? Just between us, for now. Parks and Rec, project engineer. Great pay, tons of perks, flex vacations, and they came to me. But I'd be an idiot to pass this up. An idiot who's in love and not doing anything about it. Yeah, but you heard Josie. She wants to be swept off her feet. So make it happen. Create that big romantic moment that she's dreaming of. I have been... composing a letter. Yeah, I know it's corny, like something out of an old movie. Which is why it's perfect. What's perfect? Oh, I grabbed some leftover scones. My best man speech, I hope. We'll find out in a week. - Bye. - Thank you. Yeah, bye. We're a certified non-profit offering free tutoring for teens with an eye on higher edu... I understand. Only so much funding could go around. Thank you for your time. Now you got calendar and new student enrolment forms for you to sign off on. Ahh, come on. We'll get 'em next time. Good thing I hired you, Taye. You're even more unrealistically optimistic than I am. I'll take the praise. Though I'd prefer a promotion. What you deserve is a raise. We need to double funding, and fast. Otherwise we're going to have to start cutting tutoring hours. Ah, you won't let that happen. I have the utmost faith in you. Thank you. You deserve both a promotion and a raise. Oh, well. Thank you. I'll remember that. It's time. Your first bridal look. Okay, no... no crying missy. Those lashes took ten minutes. And the finishing touch. It's almost too beautiful to throw. Oh no, you're throwing it straight to Athena here. I want to finish grad school before I even think about a wedding. Except... Except what? Okay, we were at Brian's house and I was cold, so I went to get a sweatshirt out of his dresser. And this sweatshirt is special because... Because there was a ring box under it? Okay, I wasn't snooping. I was cold. Did you at least open the box? No, no. I... I want to be surprised when it happens, or if it happens. Oh, it's happening. You are catching my bouquet. The bouquet knows who to find. ♪ ♪ Ohhh, oh ♪ ♪ Ohhh, oh, ohh ♪ ♪ Ohhh, oh ♪ ♪ Ohhh, oh, ohh... ♪ How romantic was that ceremony? I got to admit, I got a little misty. A little misty? You went through all my emergency Kleenex. I happily embrace my feelings. That's why I love you. Thank you for this. My feet are on strike. I told you to get a size up. Lesson learned. When I get married, I'm wearing sneakers. Well, that's a sight I can't wait to see. Who said you all are invited? I might dramatically elope like I'm in an old film noir. That's my cue. Speech? That pocket. You're a great writer, I'm sure it's perfect. You got this. Thanks. I've been asked by the bride and groom to say a few words. Yeah, just a few, because we're hungry. As you know, Ted is my cousin. And I introduced him to my good friend, Emma, from college, which is my roundabout way of taking credit for this marriage. Ted and Emma are a perfect match. They make each other smile. And that's the thing about joy. It's meant to be experienced with that... one person who brings that special light into your life. Congratulations Ted and Emma, wishing you a wonderful life of bliss. Congratulations. - Cheers. - Cheers. ♪ Mmm, you're the perfect love, perfect love ♪ ♪ Mmm, you're the perfect love ♪ ♪ Your love got me feelin' like I'm superman, yeah ♪ Oh! Wow. I am so sorry. No, all good. It's my fault. I wasn't watching where I was going, and I should be wearing shoes. Will Forsythe. Josie Hughes. ♪ I'd ask you to dance, but I'm trying to impress you, and my disco would definitely not impress you. Why don't we get a drink instead? Ah! How do you know the happy couple? I was just about to ask the same. My dad does a lot of business with Ted's dad. We're one of those. "I suppose we must invite the Forsythes" invitations. Nonsense. I'm sure Ted and Emma are thrilled you're here. As for me, I met Emma in college. Oh, along with the Best Man. Yeah, Alex. And Athena, the other bridesmaid? The four of us lived on the same dorm floor in college and just clicked. In fact, Athena and I are still roommates. Besides being an extremely loyal friend, what else do you do? You're going to regret asking. Work is my passion. I've been accused once or twice of being obsessed with work myself. Tell me about yours. I'm the founder of a non-profit called The Study Hall Club. We provide college prep for teens in underserved communities. Our mission is to give them a hand up in life. Wow, that's impressive. Kids are what's impressive. They're motivated and smart. The mysterious stranger I've just met is both beautiful and noble. Thanks. Well, I hustle for funding all day, so how fun. Had I known stepping on feet was a great way to meet someone, I would've started long ago. Where's Josie? She got another dance partner. Go Josie. Who's Mr. Smooth over here? That's Will Forsythe of "the Forsythes". A big society family. All lawyers. Well, what do you know? Maybe Josie just found her Mr. Perfect after all. Single ladies, single ladies. It is time for the wedding bouquet toss! Come on down, come on down to the dance floor. Maid of Honour duties call. It's time to catch the bouquet. Good luck, you two. There is no luck necessary. The bouquet has a destiny to fulfill. It's true. I'm a believer, you know. Let's go. You get it, honey. Three, two, one! Josie caught the bouquet. She's the next to get married. Bill. Bill. Bill. Oh hey, 20 percent off that froyo place that you love. Oh, okay, well then I'll keep it to myself. Coupon, now. It still doesn't make sense. Oh no. Not the flowers again. That bouquet was meant for Athena. She's supposed to get married next. And who says that won't happen? The lore does. I'm a big believer. All right, well listen, big believer. Lots of people catch the bouquet and nothing happens. Also, aren't you single? Thanks for pointing it out. Yes. But Aunt Amy was single. Though there was a guy waiting in the wings. Maybe a guy is waiting in the wings for you and you just don't know it yet. - Alex! - Hey. My man. You are just in time. Time for what? If I have to hear that bouquet story again, I'm gonna need to ask you for a job, please. It just doesn't make sense. Study Hall Club. I was in the neighbourhood for work. New green space renovation project. You got time for lunch? Lunch, away from my desk? Mm-hmm. Yeah, just, um, just give me a moment please. That is Colossal Insurance. From the CEO's office. It's for you. For me. This is Josie Hughes. Really? Yes. Yes. I see. Yes, yes. Friday is perfect. I'll have my assistant set everything up. Thanks so much. Goodbye. Somehow, Colossal Insurance heard about us, they're coming here for a presentation Friday. If they like what they hear, they're going to sponsor us. Seriously? That's fantastic. It's enough funding for an entire year. Yes! Uh, rain check on lunch. I gotta get started on this presentation ASAP. No worries. Bean Street Java, Sunday. They're showing Casablanca. It's a date. See ya. It's Athena. Engaged. Can you believe it? Tell me everything, spare no detail. Okay, so Brian, in a very out of character romantic move, suggests we go for a walk in the park by the duck pond. Park, ducks, love it, go on. Then he gets down on one knee and pulls out the ring box. Romantic. Tell me more. Except he fumbled it, and it flew into the duck pond and sank. A park ranger fished it out. Finger, ring, done deal. Whoo! Even if it is slightly more blindingly sparkly than I'd usually wear to student teach in a geology lab. Well, if anyone can pull off the diamond lab coat combo, it's you. His mom helped choose it. I know diamonds are a girl's best friend, but I always pictured a prasiolite or a labradorite. Well, this is gorgeous. Good thing you have a master's thesis to focus on, or you'd stare at it all day. I'm excited to start planning. And you already have an experienced bouquet designer, and Emma, queen of planning, will be back from her honeymoon soon. I'm picturing fun, casual backyard wedding. Brian's mom Donna has this huge yard. You can get those barbecue guys. Oh, great idea. Or an ice cream truck. Designer doughnuts. Both. And a karaoke machine. My fiancé fancies himself a rock star. I'll toast to that. Confession? I was worried that I derailed your engagement. But amazingly, this time the bouquet had it wrong. Confession, I'm relieved too. Although you never know. You never know what? Your perfect guy could suddenly swoop in. All right, Michelangelo. Relax. It's bagels, not a work of art. I fidget when I'm nervous. Josie. You and I both know you're going to kill it today. They're here. Hello, gentlemen, nice to meet you. Welcome to Study Ha- Funny running into you here. Why do I get the feeling this isn't a coincidence? I'm general counsel for Colossal Insurance. I was impressed by your passion for your non-profit. Preston Yates, our CEO. Josie Hughes. Will should be your PR guy. We're excited to hear this pitch. ...with a corporate sponsor like Colossal Insurance, we can continue to offer this service locally, with a vision of taking it citywide. Wonderful. Thank you, Miss Hughes. That was truly inspirational. - Thank you. - Thank you. Flawless presentation. Slam dunk. I told you, you got this. Let me talk to Preston, but I'd say this is a done deal. Really? That's incredible. I have to confess. This was also an elaborate ploy to see you again. I lost track of you at the wedding after the bouquet toss. Oh, yeah. I got a little distracted. I was... going to ask for your number, but what if I asked for a date instead? Are you free Saturday? Saturday as in tomorrow? She's free. Okay, thank you social secretary. Taye's right, I am free, yes. Perfect. Interesting aspect of my job is risk management. I do forecasts to minimize negative financial risks. And enough rambling about work. No. It's interesting, really. Thank you for humouring me. I want to know more about you. Tell me something that's very... Josie. Well, I'm a sucker for anything romantic. Old black and white movies, love songs, kind of playful banter only Hepburn and Tracy can pull off. Corny and sentimental, I know. Not at all. It's charming. Let's make a wish. You believe in all that? Yeah. Why not believe in the possibilities in life? You know it's funny. I almost didn't go to Ted's wedding. Business trip. I'm glad it got cancelled last minute. Me too. ♪ Still plenty of time for Bogart and Bergman. Did you get me a... A hot apple cider? I did. - Thank you. - Of course. Also popcorn. What's a movie without popcorn? Agreed. How'd the pitch go? Good. No, great. No, amazing. That's quite the escalation. We got the funding. Congrats! Did you solve the mystery of how they found you? Do remember the guy I was talking to at the wedding, Will Forsythe? Of The Forsythes? Turns out he's Colossal's General Counsel. He set the whole thing up. I was so surprised, especially because... he asked me on a date. And you said... Yes. We went on our first date last night. It was perfect. He's so great. He said he almost didn't come to the wedding. I think it's fate. I haven't seen Casablanca in years. "Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world," "she walks into mine." That's your Bogey voice? Yeah. "I think this is going to be the beginning" "of a beautiful friendship." Mine was far superior. If you say so. Ladies first. You should go on a date. What? With who, exactly? We live in a city. There are plenty of options. I forgot how much fun it is. Take the plunge. Love the enthusiasm, but I'm good. Come on. Online dating? It worked for Athena and Brian. I want to see you happy. This popcorn needs M&Ms. Mm-hmm. I'll be right back. Okay. Next profile question. Three things about you. How did you talk me into this again? My powers of persuasion. I'm irresistible. No stalling. Answer. Fine, um... bashful, sleepy, sneezy. Okay, be serious, Dopey. Fine. I have it, then. Kind, sentimental, and hilarious. I can't call myself "hilarious" on my own profile. You're the funniest person I know. Adventurous. Gives you an air of... mystery. Good news. We got it! You got what? - The ballroom at the... - The... Sorry, you go. The ballroom at the country club. Oh. Weddings are very competitive there, but I pulled a few strings and got a spot for two months from today. Oh, Alex, Josie, this is Brian's mom, Donna. Nice to meet you. Oh, Donna. Can you stay? I can make tea. We have an amazing Darjeeling. - Oh yeah, I'm on it. - Thank you. That is very sweet, but I have a hair appointment. Listen, I am so touched to be involved here. As a mother of a son, I never thought I'd get a chance to plan a wedding. And... I want to pay for everything. The entire wedding? Mom's insisting. Hey, one good thing about being an only child, right? Yeah, wow. Thank you. Thank you so much. Yeah, of course. It's uh, it's my pleasure. Right. Got to drive Mom. Sweetie, I'll call you later. Bye, love you. Love you too! What a day. I am exhausted. I need sweatpants, stat. Does this mean no backyard barbecue? Donna really wants the elegant club, and when Brian saw the ballroom he was 100 percent on board, so. Well, look at the bright side. A price tag of "paid for by Donna" is nice. I do have a mountain of student loans looming on the horizon. Right, uh, and you'd be making your future mother-in-law very happy. Which is what I want. I want the wedding process to go as smoothly as possible, you know? Thank you. What do we have here? We are signing Alex up for online dating. Oh, I want in. Um... Ah, ah, ah! I'm outnumbered here, am I? - Mm-hmm. - Yes. Stop making that face. This is my smiling face. You look like you're about to sneeze. A dating profile picture has to be perfect. It has to be you. You need to be spontaneous. See, you look... you look good here. Okay, I'll just use that one. I can't be in your profile picture. Then I'll crop you out. That's even worse. That just implies that you have no problem cropping one woman out of your photo and photoshopping another woman into your life. Their generation never had to find love on a phone. It just sort of happened. I bet you they even wrote love letters. Oh. I'm a sucker for a handwritten love letter. But times are changing. We have to keep up. Oh, I'm a genius. I got it. This is kind, sentimental, adventurous. It's you. How'd you do that? I know the real you. Okay. Dating profile complete. Let's find you a date. No, nope, too into running. I like running. Extreme ultra marathons? Too much running. No. Do I get a say in finding future Mrs. Me? Hmm. Wait, what about her? Says she's a nurse. I like that. Loyal, reliable, generous. She sounds more like a shoppers' reward program than a girlfriend. Here, give me that. Don't you want to shop more? Nope. When you know, you know, right? Like you and Will and the Forsythes. Right, right, right. Um, in fact, we actually have a date tonight. Where is... It's almost 4:00. Thanks for coming all the way over here. Quarterly financials have me working late all week. I like a little field trip. I made reservations for sushi, but we just missed them. My fault. We can come up with plan B. Actually, I already did. I've never had an indoor picnic before. This is quite adventurous. I spend most nights eating delivery at my desk, so sitting on the floor is definitely an adventure. I didn't know what you liked, so I ordered, well, everything. That's great, because I like everything. Especially... wait for it. Oh, sesame noodles. Are there any... Any what? Chopsticks. I'm terrible with chopsticks. So am I. That's what makes them so much fun. ♪ ♪ You bring the love... ♪ You said you like love songs. You remembered. ♪ You bring the love, love ♪ ♪ I'll chase the clouds away ♪ We're all checked in.

I don't know, I've never been a fan of empire style though. Oh, too bad. I adore this dress. And it has pockets. Okay, it's not my dress, but it might be yours, Jose. Try it on. Me? No. You're the bride. Honestly, I could use a break. Try it. Okay. You look amazing in that. I have to admit, I do love it. You might need it soon. You did catch Emma's bouquet after all. Okay, it's only been two dates with Will. Will? As in Forsythe? Yep. We met at your wedding. Yeah, Will's a terrific guy. Ted always says so. But you two just met. Okay, I know I might be rushing into things a little, but you yourself said I have to get back in the game. Maybe things haven't worked out with other people because they're supposed to work out with Will. There you girls are. Oh, I'm sorry. I thought Athena was trying on dresses today. Oh, no. I am. I was just taking a little breather. Oh, phew. Then I'm not too late. Brian spilled the beans that you three had a dress appointment, and I couldn't resist crashing the party. Oh, I should've invited you. I just didn't want you to feel obligated, and I... No. I'm going to go change... And I will start looking for dresses for my darling Athena. Oh, you look so beautiful. It's a dream. It might be maybe a bit much. No, no, nothing is too much. You deserve your princess moment. Just let me, let me fix this a little bit here. How about I try something... Oh... That did not just happen. This is my fault. I got carried away. I will pay for the repairs. No, it's my fault. I should. You are a graduate student who teaches part time. Please. I insist. Thank you. I'm going to go change before I ruin something else. I'll go and talk to the receptionist. I'm sure it happens all the time. On that note, I sense wedding dress shopping is over for today. Yes. Jose, what's up? I'm worried about something that's probably not anything, but maybe might be something, and I need your wisdom slash insight to convince me it's nothing. Sounds intriguing, but I'm just working on a project. Um okay, what about Bean Street tonight? They're showing Roman Holiday at 8:00. I wish I could, but can't. Believe it or not, I've got a date. With Marissa! Oh, that was quick. Um, okay, yeah, never mind. I'll figure it out. Okay, have fun, bye. Huh. I... I forgot how awkward first dates can be. Am I totally flailing? No. Is this been a while for you? Yeah. My friend Josie wrote my online profile, sent me against my will. My roommate wrote mine. Like, I finally couldn't hear "get back out there" one more time, so I just gave in. Your online profile said that you like live music, and I read great reviews of this Jazz trio playing here tonight. Well, this is turning out better than I'd hoped. I feel the same way. From the Will Forsythe. Hmm. Okay, I'm going to need a translation for that "hmm." No diss to our generous sponsor, but dude is trying too hard. What's wrong with flowers? It just seems like he got some intern to pick the most expensive arrangement on the website. Isn't that how people do flowers? Not you. To you, bouquets are a story of love. That's right, they are. Where's my man Alex been lately? He is busy online dating. I always got a vibe with you two. Me and Alex? Yeah. Alex wouldn't buy some Tuesday special from a flower shop. He'd pick something that was you. Alex and I are just friends. I picked up a few bridal magazines. A few? Okay, fine. All of them. But look. Fall wedding trends, dos and don'ts. - First dance fails. - Ooh. Bridesmaids' views. Black or red? Decisions. Emma? Definitely the black. I'm really nervous. It's a fancy event at the Lakeside Hotel. Meeting Will's friends? He said colleagues. Colleagues are like friends, right? Like Taye and me? I just want to make a good impression. Good call on the black, Emma. That keen eye is why Emma's here helping me pick invitations. Donna sent over a... load of samples. Please, I'm excited to help. You know, in all honesty, I've been a little bit adrift since the honeymoon ended. Not because of Ted, being married is a dream. I just... I miss all the planning. It was fun and creative, and I miss the spreadsheets, the budgets. I even miss writing thank you notes. Ugh, I wish I was like you. I find it so overwhelming. Like, Donna's ideas for invitations are really elaborate. It looks like a romantic storybook. I always envisioned plantable paper invitations. Card stock with wildflower seeds embedded in it. Eco friendly. Very Athena. I have a contact at a specialty stationery store. Emma, I know what your next career should be. Wedding planner. Wha? Seriously. You're a natural. Well thank you, ladies. But I don't... I don't even know how I would begin to start a new career. Love you! Maybe Josie finally has found her Prince Charming. Mm-hmm. You're not Team Will? I just... I just want to see Josie with someone who gets her for her. You heard Burnham, Leeds and Dreyer is folding? It's a shame. Solid firm. I'm going to go to the bar. Do you want anything? I'll join you in a minute. So, how's everything in your world these days? I know they keep you busy. Josie? What a delight to see you. Mr. Yates. Hello. Preston, please. You were a brave soul to come to this. My wife refuses. She doesn't like parties? Parties, sure. Networking events, not so much. This is a networking event. Also... Thank you. Doubles as dinner. I hear our sponsorship has already been put to good use. I can't thank you enough for coming aboard with funding. There are a lot of worthy non-profits, so the kids are really grateful you chose them. It's my pleasure. The boss yakking your ear off? More like the other way around. Never. Josie, always a pleasure. - Enjoy your night. - Thank you. Look at you, working the room. I don't know about that. But I was happy to see Preston. When you said you were work obsessed, I knew you were for me. I didn't say obsessed, I said passionate. Although non-profits are 24/7, so I guess it's the same thing. It's Dan Greenberger. Come on, I'll introduce you. Hey, how was your date with Will yesterday? Um, it turned out to be more of a networking event. Hmm. But it was great. I ran into Mr. Yates. And what about Will? He was good. We just didn't get to spend that much time together, is all. Oh, I have to go meet Alex at the winery. I should go get ready. I don't think we've played cornhole since college. Yeah. Like good old times. I thought it would be a fun surprise. Alright. She's got a firm grip on the beanbag. She's winding up for the toss. Mm-hmm. All right, there's the flick of the wrist, she lets it go, and... Ooh. On the board! Beat that. Okay, throw it. It's cornhole, not a major life decision. Greatness shouldn't be rushed. Oh! When I said beat that, I didn't mean literally. Nice job. Thank you. Okay, so this winery makes Athena's favourite Pinot Gris. Thought I'd get Donna some brochures. Maybe if we have the engagement party here, it'll put Athena at ease. She needs one thing to go smoothly in this wedding. Uh-oh. Trouble in paradise? Uh... I mean, kinda. From the moment Brian proposed, there have been hiccups with the engagement. First he almost lost the ring in a pond. His mother is, well let's just say overly enthusiastic. And when I called you, Athena had just accidentally demolished a couture gown. And you think this is because you caught her bouquet. I mean, yeah. What if I'm ruining their engagement? Jose, someone else's wedding isn't off because they didn't catch it. You're right. Silly. How was your date with Marissa? I'm surprised it took you this long to ask. We completely hit it off and I'm surprised I met someone right out of the gate. You guys going to go out again? We already had our second date. Second? So soon? Yeah. Like, you and Will. I figured why hold back, right? That is still going strong, right? Yeah. Yeah. Flowers, picnics, all the signs. Crazily enough, I think I found my ideal wedding dress. Sounds like you're moving fast. Yeah, well, like you just said, there's no need to hold back. I should bring Will here. He'd love it. Yeah. I should, I should do that with Marissa. I have a brilliant idea. We should go on a double date. The four of us. Are you sure that's so brilliant? - Yeah. - Sure. Uh, sounds... sounds like fun. We can... do it. I have a trip to Chicago planned next week, and we can do it the weekend when I get back. Great, great. It's on. Can't wait. - Hey. - Hey. Alex told me about the job in Chicago. Potential job in Chicago. And you're the only two who know. Did you have an in-person interview? Yeah, and it went well. If I get the offer, they'll want a fast decision. All right. Well, I'm going to throw this in the laundry. I'll be right back. Sounds good, man. So, Josie tells me that she and Will are going out to dinner with you and Marissa. Isn't someone supposed to be writing a love letter instead of going on double dates? And by someone, I mean you? Josie's intent on making it work with Will. I can't bust that up. So you're just giving up instead? I don't know. Maybe Marissa and this job are signs that I should change up my life. Stop pining over the girl that I've loved since college. Maybe it's not that Josie and I have bad timing, or we're never single at the same time, or whatever excuse I tell myself for never telling her how I feel. Maybe it's not meant to be. Okay. So then tell her about Chicago. If I tell Josie, that makes it final. Alex. You need to make up your mind. Tell Josie something before it's too late. ♪ Thank you. Good to see you again, Alex. You too. This is Marissa. Hi, it's nice to meet you both. When Alex told me we're going to Chez Royal, I couldn't believe it. I mean, isn't it impossible to get a reservation here? Well, Will makes the impossible possible. The boeuf bourguignon is excellent here. As is the coq au vin. So you speak French, Will? I speak menu. I dine here often. Alex, how was Chicago? Let's not talk work tonight. What is it you do again, Alex? Environmental development. I revitalize urban green spaces. So you design parks. Uh... No, it's so much more than that. What Alex does is really inspirational. No wonder you guys are friends. You're both do-gooders. I suppose we are. Well, I think the world could always use more parks. Agreed. There's something romantic about parks. That's why I picked one for our first date. You know, I've never been to Chicago. I'd love to go sometime. They have a great live music scene. Well, you already know I love that. Let me know next time you go. I have Chicago connections. I can get you theatre tickets, top restaurant reservations. You name it. It's a constant balancing act of debt, equity, and internal finances, but that's life at a Fortune 500 company. Which is why you work such long hours. I'm passionate about work, but I don't want to miss out on life. Agreed. Life is about all the possibilities, and should include more cornhole. So back in college, Josie and I, along with Emma and Athena, were part of this, like, unofficial cornhole league. We played every week on the quad. Where you toss those beanbags? Yes. And we gave each other these ridiculous nicknames. Like Alex was Alexcalibur. Josie was Jo No Mercy. I'm very serious about cornhole. Oops. Thank you. No. You're my guests tonight. I insist. No, really. It's my treat. This restaurant's quite expensive. No, no I get it. But I can handle it. The universe has spoken. Split the cheque. Shooting star. What did you wish for? I can't tell you. It won't come true. Found them. Did you make a wish? Oh, the stars. Sorry, I missed it. What's with you and Josie? What do you mean? We're friends. I ask because I was hoping that this was going somewhere, but I suspect your heart's already taken. Let's get you home. Athena, what happened? There was a fire at the country club. The ballroom is ruined. It's going to take months to rebuild. And we have to postpone the wedding. Maybe not catching Emma's bouquet really was a sign. No, you are getting married. Grand ballroom or not. My story about the "bouquet knows" is just that. It's a story. Josie, you believe that story. You've convinced me to believe it. I also believe in birthday candle wishes and lucky charms. And part of me suspects unicorns are real. Part of being a hopeless romantic is being an unrealistic dreamer. That's the part we love the most about you. Still, maybe the bouquet knows. How are things with Will? Will's a great guy. Why am I sensing a "but?" All my signs are there. Romantic meet cute. Grand sweeping gesture to get my attention. He's handsome and he's textbook perfect guy. But I guess I just wish that he got me the way that Alex gets me. I mean, Alex has known you forever. That's to be expected. Maybe part of the problem is that we've been spending all of our time in Will's world. So I invited him to Bean Street for movie night. The Philadelphia Story. Oof. Cheating on Alex with movie night. I won't tell. Alex is busy dating a nice woman. But you know what will make everything better? Ice cream. That's probably Will checking in. Sorry, almost done. Work emails. Black coffee for you. - Latte for me. - Thank you. You don't like popcorn? Trying to lay off carbs this week. My trainer's orders. I can't believe you've never seen The Philadelphia Story. I don't, I don't go to the movies a lot. ♪ ♪ That's why I don't go to the movies. Everyone hates me. I promise. No more phones. Isn't it romantic? Tracy and Dexter remarrying? I was kind of rooting for Mike. Jimmy Stewart has his charms. I want to get married one day. Me too. Good to know. Bye, guys. Take care. Good job today. Hey you! What are you up to? I've come to kidnap you. It's a surprise. What is it? Do you not know how surprises work? Just go with it, dude. I got this. You heard the man. Let's go! Okay. Okay. My latest project about to open up to the public. Oh, it's beautiful here. You did a great job. Yeah. It was a neglected private park that was acquired by the city. The trees are great. Look at that trellis. Yeah, my boss wanted to tear that trellis down and put up something modern. But I argued successfully to keep and restore it. It's the perfect setup for a photo opportunity. Dressed up, it could be used as a wedding venue. As in Athena and Brian's new wedding venue? Mm-hmm. Look at you, you closet romantic. It's not much of a secret that I'm a romantic. It's one of your finer traits. Oh. Give me a minute? Yeah. No worries, I'm going to explore. Okay. Alex Balfour. Hey, Len Melcher here. HR for Chicago Parks and Rec. Congratulations, I just emailed you a job offer. Do I have a few days to consider? Sure, but we'll need a response pretty quick. Okay. Josie. I need to say something. So do I. I have imagined every scenario in this space. We can hang wedding flowers and bunting there, and the guest seating can go here. I love how even a small park is full of possibilities for you. Well, daydreaming encourages greatness. So you will stand here. There. You are Brian in this scenario. So be Brian-like. Okay, like... Sure. Yes. Is this Brian enough for you? Yeah, very impressive Brian impression. Great. Okay. The aisle is here. And I am the bride, Athena. Athena darling, you look so radiant today. Okay, focus. Don't ruin Athena's big day. Keep imagining. And as she approaches Brian, he takes her hand, and he notices how the autumn light catches her hair, gleaming. They stare deep into each other's eyes, and it's like the world has stopped just for them. They're surrounded by their friends and family, but they only see each other. Josie... Yes, so. It's perfect. This space was just waiting for you to transform it. Good job. So um, are you gonna take Marissa to Athena and Brian's engagement party? That's what I want to talk to you about. We broke it off. Why? I thought you really liked her. She's awesome. She's just not my awesome. I couldn't picture a future with her like I could picture a... Do you want to get married? One day. Yeah. With the right person. Me too. Will wants to get married. Will asked you to marry him? Oh no, no. He didn't propose. It's still way too early for that. And if he asks, you'll say yes? I mean, Will checks all the boxes. I'd be crazy to say no. I caught Emma's bouquet, which I thought was a big fluke, but then Will came into the picture and now everything's falling into place. Not only could Athena and Brian get married here, but I could be one of the weddings too. Let's go check out over there. ♪ Len. Alex Balfour. I don't need more time. I'll take the job. I know Athena's nervous about today, so I'm glad we can be her backup. Me too. But I can't stay late. I have a call later with China. But it's Saturday. Day off. No such thing in my world. I know you don't know them well, but this is important to me. Oh, stay as long as you want. I'll treat you to a car service. And to make it up to you, we can have lunch together tomorrow. Come by the office, we'll order in. I really like the urban picnic, but what about a real one? I mean, it's prime fall picnic season. I even have a picnic basket. Sounds great, but on a deadline. I inherited my workaholic DNA from my dad. He was actually on a business trip when I was born. Did you see him much growing up? Not as much as I would've liked, but all this hard work afforded me opportunities, like law school. But don't you think parents should be there for their kids? Like going to recitals and baseball games and all that? I turned out okay, right? What did you wish for when we threw the coins in the fountain on our first date? Oh. I um... The usual good thing. World peace. World peace. Yeah, why not? ♪ Hey look. I didn't eat it all before I made it to you. How romantic. And much appreciated, thank you. Well, it looks like the party is already a roaring success. Thanks to your recommendation. Well, I can't take all the credit. I had a partner in crime helping me check the place out. Mm-hmm. Wine, merriment, gorgeous scenery. It was a huge sacrifice. Oh look, there's the Dudleys. Oh yeah, my mom's friend, from the club. They're old friends of my father's. Um, I should go say hello. Sure. I'll catch up to you in a minute. All right. Oh, hey man. Congrats on Chicago. Ted just told me. Sounds amazing. What's amazing about Chicago? Alex, that's my bad. I thought you'd already started to tell people. Tell people what? Oh, Ted just told me now at the buffet. Told you what? Alex, why don't you just say what everybody already seems to know? I got offered a job in Chicago. A really good job. And I accepted. You're moving. To Chicago. When? Funny part about that story, next week. You're moving next week? And you're just telling us this now? I didn't want to distract from Brian and Athena's party. Oh, I'd welcome the distraction, but we're going to miss you. A lot. Proud of you, man. Prepare for house guests. We've been spending all this time together this week, and you haven't once mentioned this job. And now you're just up and leaving me... Us. I mean us? No, it's, it's not like that, Jose. I didn't tell you because I've been on the fence about it. I'm sorry that the news came out so wrong. I'm going to miss you guys. Tons. This is what I want. It's time for me to move on, and you have Will who... makes you happy. So you're an expert now on what makes me happy? Okay, um, well I wouldn't want to stand in the way of you moving on. You'll have to excuse me, I'm going to go find Will. You okay, man? Sure. I just need a minute. Yeah. We get it. Um, I think it's time for my bride to be and me to mingle anyways. Yeah. Ted, why don't you go with them? I'll catch up. All right. Did the merits of the Chicago job finally win out? Or is it Josie? You know it's Josie. I can't watch her fall for someone else. It is not too late to finish that letter. I should go. I don't want to ruin everybody else's day. Alex, no. Stay. You're fine. I don't want to upset Josie more than she already is. Brian and Athena deserve to have a drama-free party. Wish them my love. Thank you. Ah, I got... Josie, what's wrong? Can we talk in private? Uh, yeah. Someone made the enormous mistake of handing me a microphone, so I suppose I should start by saying "ladies and gentlemen, please gather around." It's that time for me to share the true account of how I... Will, I thought fate brought you to me. I thought that my romantic destiny was being foretold by a wedding bouquet. That the stars had aligned, and I'd found my once in a lifetime love like my friends had all found. But it wasn't true. Are you... breaking up with me? Yes. Because it's the right thing to do. I had this fantasy of this perfect life between us. But the fantasy wasn't reality, and it's not fair to you. You're a great guy. You're just not my guy. I'm bummed, but not that surprised. You've been a guardian angel as far as funding for Study Hall Club, and I understand if Colossal Insurance can no longer back us. No. Please. We're proud to support you. That has nothing to do with you and me. Study Hall Club does good work. What made you change your mind about us? Was it the work thing? The kids thing? More like a message from the universe thing. As in I suspect I was living the perfect life already, but wasn't paying attention. I was so focused on the romantic ideal that I overlooked all the real world signs, and now it's too late. Now I know I've been known to monopolize a conversation, and a buffet table or two. So I would like to invite my lovely bride to speak. Um, Athena, why don't you tell the funny story about how we, well, how I almost lost the ring? Um... Sorry, the story? Yeah, when I dropped the ring in the duck pond, remember? Oh. Um... Brian and I had such a wonderful time picking out a ring for Athena. So, you can imagine my surprise when he called to tell me it had fallen into a duck pond. I ruined everything. Honey. No, you've ruined nothing. I'm sorry if I got carried away. I just want you to be happy. That's all I care about. Here I was nervous for days that something was going to go wrong, and I was what went wrong. No, no. I ran out of there, because I thought I was going to faint. I'm sorry to interrupt, but I need to speak with Athena. Alone. I love you so much. Me too. What's going on? Are people leaving? The engagement story didn't go exactly as planned. Did something happen with Will? I just ended things with him. Oh no. Why? I really wanted it to work, but just because I caught the bouquet doesn't mean Will is my perfect catch. Is this about Alex? Talk to him. Change his mind. No, he said he was moving on. He made it very clear. That's what he wants. Josie, you should know... Car's out front. You ready? I should know what? Nothing. Let's go. I'm really sorry. I... I got carried away. No. I have been a wreck. I know you just want to be involved. But it's your wedding. It's not mine. When Brian said Ed and I got married, we were young, and we had no money. We got hitched at the courthouse, and then we went for pancakes. Not exactly a royal wedding. Actually, a pancake wedding breakfast sounds pretty perfect to me. It was delicious. I just wanted all the pomp and opulence and all of the extras that my friends had. I understand. I'm just not a pomp and opulence person. Digging around for rocks is my happy place. And I kept insisting that it had to be my way. Including that ring, which is the kind of ring I always wanted. Well, the ring is growing on me. Oh! We had a good life, Ed and I. I have money now, and I just wanted to give you both the day that I always dreamed of. I love that you care. We'll find a middle ground. Whatever makes you and Brian happy, okay? Oh! Hugging? This is good, right? Yeah. Hugging is good. Okay. Hugging is good. That's our Brian. Athena, he's your Brian now. ♪ Hey, closing up early today, Alex. Sure man. Just give me two minutes. Okay. This is your fault! Oh my goodness, are you okay? What happened? Can you say something so I can stop asking questions with exclamation points? I'm fine. The wedding is still on. Donna's story helped me understand where she's coming from. And what a beautiful story it is. So what's next? I agreed to the club. The ballroom is being rebuilt and will be done early next year, but only if I get my barbecue and my ice cream truck. That sounds like a fair compromise. Mm-hmm. So the wedding's postponed six months, which is actually kind of ideal, because I'll have graduated by then and hopefully landed my professorship. You get your dream ending after all. What about your dream ending? While I was hiding out on the stairs, Brian told me I missed a lot. You and Alex aren't speaking? You broke up with Will. Maybe one happy ending is enough for the day? I'll tell you this much though, I am, I'm done with the lore of the bouquet nonsense. It was stupid to be such a believer. No, come on. I love that hopeless romantic side of you. Don't lose that. You're going to find the person that you're looking for. It just might not look exactly like you've always dreamed of. Sensible Josie doesn't think so. From now on, I'm going to plant my feet. No more unicorns and wishing wells, and definitely no more bouquets. Don't work too late. Thanks, Dad. Okay, what I mean is, hasn't Alex's party already started? 7:00 PM. Mm-hmm. What, you're really going to do data entry over saying goodbye to Alex? Didn't you say you were leaving? Yeah. All right. Um, these just came in. I'll see you in the AM. Goodnight. "Dear Josie. "I've been composing this letter for a long time now. "My endeavour to make a grand gesture. "But what matters is I tell you the contents of my heart. "I see you for who you are, "a romantic, beautiful dreamer, loving and kind, "whose smile lights up any room. "You embrace life. "You welcome joy. "Seeing all the possibilities in the world and in others. "Amazingly, you also see me for who I am. "I want nothing more" "than to share this thing called life with you." "Love, Alex." Am I too late? Is he already gone? No. I'm right here. I went to your work, but you'd left. To come here. I got your letter. Don't go to Chicago. I'm not. Chicago's windy. It's far. And you're not there. Wait. You got my letter? How? It's called the postal service. It was beautiful. I guess it found its way. Maybe a guy might've picked it up and stuck it in the mailbox. I guess I've just been looking for the signs and missing the truth. Love is what you have with your best friend. A person who knows what you want, even when you don't. Soul mates. You know the night of the shooting star? I made a wish. It just came true. Yeah! Finally. Oh no, no, no. Oh no, missy. No crying. Emergency tissue. I still can't believe I'm the first one to get married. The bouquet really does find who it's meant to find. Well, ceremony checklist complete. Of course, you've had it under control since the day I hired you. We are so thrilled that you finally decided to take the leap and be a wedding planner. Thanks. But I couldn't have done it without you two. Not only as my first clients, but as my best friends. Now, for the finishing touch. ♪ Okay, neither one of us are pros like you.
