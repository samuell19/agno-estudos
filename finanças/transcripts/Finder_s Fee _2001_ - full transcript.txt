(Dog barking) (Woman's voice on TV) Quiglev! (Game show on TV) (TV) You can spin again and risk it all, or walk the plank and risk your life! Mrs Darmsetter? - Oh, hi. - Hey. You left your door open again. I wonder how that happened? - So how's everything? - Well, I'm worried about my mail. I think someone's stealing it. I haven't received any letters from my kids in a long time, and they always write. - Well, are they taking all your mail? - No, just the letters. You'd think they'd take everything, but they don't. Well, I'll talk to the super about it, OK? And I'll keep an eye out too. - Thanks, hon. - Hey... - I got dessert. - Oh, for heaven's sake. - I couldn't eat that whole thing. - OK. I suppose I could eat some of it now and save the rest for later. - I suppose. - Thank you. - I'm home tonight if you need anything. - Good. - Bye. Me too. - Yeah? OK. .1' ...changed my life ♪ You're like an angel from above ♪ Bring me home Oh, you bring me love ♪ I was lonely till you showed me... - Hey, babe. - Hey. I know. I'm early. I'm not gonna stay. I just can't stop thinking about tonight and I had to see you. Are you mad? - We did say after rehearsal. - I'll be back after rehearsal. I had to make sure you weren't having second thoughts. This is a good thing. After rehearsal, Carla. How hard is it to fix a leak? My outside key didn't work again. That guy with the dog let me in. I called the guy eight times already. Fix the damn leak. Just fix it. So you told Dwight you were gonna be out of town? Is that the story? Yeah, I know. I don't get it. I don't get it, Tep. Why lie? Why not just say, "Dwight, I can't do it", huh? - There's nothing wrong with that. - It's easier. Yeah? Except now you can't even come and see the show. - I'll say my plans fell through. - Why go through all that trouble? You know what? Here's Tepper and here's the truth. And you go all the way around just to end up right back where you started. (TV) If these are your numbers, you're six million richer. It's silly. As silly as pretending to not check your numbers when I know you do. - So, I'll see you tonight? - Yeah. - You'll be here? - Yep. I'm just confirming that we have a date. - Carla, you've waited six months, right? - Uh-huh. Do you wanna spoil the whole thing? No, not if it's a good thing. I'll see you tonight. - Have fun with your poker buddies. - OK. And I'll see you tonight. Elephant juice. I love you, too. Loser, it's Coop. Can't make it tonight. Order for delivery, please. The name's Tepper. - What listing, please? - Avery Phillips. - What city? - Manhattan. Avery Phillips. No listing in Manhattan. - Any other boroughs? - No, sir. - OK. Thanks. - Thank you. Avery, you should keep a number in here, buddy. (Woman) No one is available. Leave your message after the tone. Hi, Victor. if this is you, I found a wallet tonight, belongs to an Avery Phillips. Your number was inside, so if you know this guy, have him call me. My name is Tapper, and I'm at 555-0185. I'm gonna be here all night, so if he wants to stop by, he can. My address is 411 West 13th Ave, apartment number 7. And if this isn't Victor, I'm sorry to bother you, man. Bye. 10, 23... 91. (Door buzzer) - Yeah? - It's Fish. - I'm standing in a river out here. Let me in. - Come on up, Fish. Tonight's Big 3 jackpot is worth six million dollars. The winning numbers are 10, 23, 91. To hear the numbers again, press 1. Tonight's Big 3 jackpot is worth six million dollars. The winning numbers are 10, 23, 91. s1, s1. 10, 2a, s1. OK, all right. Fish, you're not gonna believe this. Do you ever check the numbers before we play? - What? - Do you ever check the numbers? - No. - Why? 'Cause the rule is you don't look. You and I don't, Bolan doesn't, Cooper doesn't. But Quigley, it's numbers time, and his TV's on so loud I can hear it from the stairwell. I'm not saying he's checking the numbers, but that kid puts the thought in my head. I don't trust that kid. Why you're friends with him makes no sense. He's gonna rub off on you. That little rodent mole stink? It's gonna rub off on you. Wake up one day, it'll be like, "What is that stink?" "I smell like Quigley!“ Better yet, wake up in 40 years and not have a friend, it's 'cause of him. Some people don't get it. He doesn't get it. Give to the Red Cross, to the United Way, but this whole friendship charity crap has gotta stop. Look. I'm done. I just need a beer like a crack whore needs a big, fat rock. Tell me you did not buy them across the street from the punk who's too cheap to tum on his freezer. You're killing me! Tep, cold beer, one week, that's all I ask for. We're playing unlimited tonight. You know, I owe everyone. - (Door buzzer) - Bet it's Bolan and he's gotta take a piss. - Tepper? - It's Fish. Get your bladder up here. Fish, let me ask you something. I found some guy's wallet today. No phone number, no driver's licence. I left a message with Victor whose number was in the wallet. - Any money? - No, and I don't want the money. If you don't want it, I want it. I'm just trying to figure out what I should do with it. Give it to a cop? Might as well throw it out the window. So you're saying I should just forget it, don't worry about it? - If there's no number, yeah, screw him. - (Knock at door) - I'll get it. - You're right. I should just...get rid of it. - I gotta pee. - You're consistent. - I've been holding it in so long it hurts. - You'll have to wear diapers. That's all I need. At least I've still got my hair, huh? Easy! We're playing unlimited, none of this 50-cent max crap. Oh, boy! I may have done permanent damage this time. Say what you want, but those pills are working. Thick as a muff, this thing. I feel good. I look good. I shouldn't be playing, so much going on with Carla. - We should make it an early one tonight. - So start already. Ten to one on a fiver says it rains all night. Statistically, I never win when it's wet. - (Knocking) - I hate this crap. - Yeah, Jake Poster, please. - What's up, Fish, fellas? - SC or Notre Dame? - Are you making a bet? - No, I'm having phone sex with your wife. - Notre Dame. - Give me three bills on SC. - Yeah, that's very funny. - I played college ball. You never ask me. - Suiting up is not playing. I gotta win. - I've got guys after me. - You bet with money you don't have. A two-by-four missed me by five minutes. - I brought wine. - Hey, more pilferage. Bolan, don't. We're allotted so much a month. Yep, for business. I'm a wine salesman. It's part of the job. What is it, bar mitzvah? You don't bring wine to poker. - (Bolan) It's time to play. - We need to get it moving here. - I'm popping the question tonight. - Five minutes, getting grief already. - A bottle here, a bottle there... - Please, stop the lecture. If one of my counsellors takes a box of pencils, it's three bucks. But if everybody takes a box, that's 300 bucks, and somebody's paying for that. Me. Companies lose billions in employee theft. - Now it's theft. - That's his point. That's what pilfering is. Screw you guys. If you don't want to drink it, don't. - I'm not coming down on you, buddy. - Yeah, you are, Bolan. You always are. - Dance with me. - What are you...? I don't wanna dance. - When did you last love yourself? - Stop with the therapy. It's not therapy this time. It was a seminar. The power of suggestion. It'll change your life. Save your breath. The Quigley mantra will always remain the same: what they don't know won't hurt 'em. Am I right, Tepper? - I'm staying out of that. - You guys have gotta learn to live a little. Open yourself up to new things, you know? Hey. How was Jeopardyl? Or was it Wheel? I forgot. Hey, Tep. What comes on right after the lottery numbers? - I don't watch that stuff. - (Fish) Must have been another apartment. Did you see the ring he scored? Under the second drawer. (Quigley) What's he talking about? This is great. Got that for two bills. - Look at that. - Fell off a truck, did it? - It's a starter ring. - Looks like your kind of ring, Quigley. You're smart not to invest a lot. Marriage can really suck. No, your marriage sucked 'cause you're an idiot. Carla's a keeper. Love that girl. Give me this. Hey, Tep... - Now, that's class. - Great way to start a marriage. It's perfect. It's just what I wanted. Give me a hand. Depending on what date you set, I've gotta get you up to camp, OK? You hang out with the kids. It'll bring you closer. - OK. - OK? One more thing. Dance class. Come with me. - Yeah. - OK. - Carla knows something's happening? - She gave him a six-month deadline. - It wasn't a deadline. - Hey. The point is, you made the right choice. Tep, when you do it, do it right. Get down on one knee. Make her feel cherished. She'll never forget it. I hope these are OK. They're the best I could find on short notice. They should have cost ten but they were in the $5 bin, so we got a deal. What? Guy said to put 'em in the fridge. Quigley, it's cool. You guys want a beer? - Yeah. - Grab mine. It's on the counter. - (Bolan) And a water. - And wine for the whiner. (Whispers) Tep, listen, if you decide that later you wanna get Carla something a little bit more substantial, let me know. I got a guy. I got a guy. He can trade that thing in and get you something real special. - Great. - OK. - What? - I got a guy. - (Impersonates Quigley) I got a guy. - Where's Coop? - He's not coming. - (Fish) That putz owes me 50 bucks. - He calls, I wanna talk to his ass. - Six million tonight, and it's all mine. (Fish) Your kidney must have squeezed your brain. You ain't taking shit. I'm bank. - There's a surprise. - And we're playing unlimited tonight. Get that chair out. Your seat's here. Tum that shit down. - I'm sitting here tonight. - You sit here. - Who cares where he sits? - I do. - I'm sitting here tonight. - That's Coop's seat. You sit here. Fine! Fine! Like an old lady. Thank you. Cough it up. Let's go. Let's go! - We're playing unlimited tonight. - We're not playing unlimited. Yeah, you know, I might have in the other chair over here, but not now. 50-cent max, three-raise limit, same as always, buddy. Thank you for your help. You're welcome. Tep. - The wine. - Oh. Oh, OK. Yeah. Thanks, Teppo. - (Fish) What is this? - $10. - You've got to be frickin' kidding me! - That's all I got. Every week it's the same thing. The cab ride over costs more. You gotta get married, if only for the food. - (Door buzzer) - Now we're talking. I got it. - You've got Big Brother Bolan. Come back. - Good evening. This is Avery Phillips. - I'm here about the wallet. - One second. What happened? - Holy shit! What did you do? - I just cut myself. - Do you have a Band-Aid or peroxide? - I'm fine. See, now, this is the perfect time to have your sweetie wrap that thing up and kiss your little face. - Why don't you get the wine for Quigley? - Yeah. - (Avery) Hello. - Tepper damn near pulled a Bobbitt. - I had an opener. - Wine and poker don't belong together. - Tep, I had an opener. - (Door buzzer) - (Avery) Hello. - Nobody's thinking about you, Quigley. - Yeah. - This is Avery Phillips. - Yeah? - You found my wallet. - Yeah, you're Avery? - Yes. You called my brother-in-law, Victor. Can I come up? Yeah, come on up, Avery. - What are you doing at the door? - The guy with the wallet has come by. - I thought there wasn't anything in it. - The guy wants his wallet. This shit was so big, Mary couldn't believe it. You call your wife in when you take a dump? - I'm proud of it. I got no secrets. - That's sick. - That's intimacy. - Tep, stop banging on your frickin' leg. You're driving me nuts. (Bolan) I clogged the frickin' bowl. It cost me 65 bucks to snake it. (Fish) I can't believe your wife has sex with you. (Bolan) Twice last night and once again this morning. Soon she's gonna be pregnant. I'll kiss that belly, rub her feet. Big Brother Bolan's gonna be Big Papa. Tep! My sperm, they're screaming for nourishment. What's up with the food? Tepper? I'm Avery Phillips. I can't tell you how much I appreciate this. In New York City, this doesn't happen. You're a good soul. It's no problem. It's still kind of wet. - It's mine all right. - I hope everything's in there. - That's how I found it. - I'm sure it is. - Well, good luck to you. - Would you mind if I call my wife? She's worried sick about the credit cards. - Unless you're in the middle of something. - No, it's no problem. It's fine. Come on in. - Noah's Ark out there. - Yeah. - Phone's in the kitchen. - I won't be a minute. - So you found this guy's wallet? - Yeah. Teppo did his good deed for the day. It's not going to help him tonight, though. Did you take the money? - Wasn't any in it. - That's what most people do. - They take the money, leave the wallet. - That's what the putz before him did. No, that's a solid thing you did. That comes back to you. Yap, yap, yap. Bolan, it's your game. Closest to the bull gets to deal. - (Fish) Let's go! - Yeah! I'm so zoned in tonight, fellas. - 20 minutes, I haven't won a dollar. - You get ahold of her? Uh, no. One phone is just not enough with a house full of girls. - Darts? - That's the sound you're hearing. - Closest to the bull. You want in? - His wife is worried. He's gotta get home. - It takes two minutes. - He doesn't have any money on him. - I got money. - You gonna let this guy sucker you? - He'll take your money. - Then lose it. - It's a buck! - I haven't played darts in years and years. I'll call your wife and let her know what's going on. I gotta take a shot at that bull. - If that's all right. - Well... Yeah! You got a buck, you're in. Hey, Tep, get the man a dart. Let's go. - Hey, I'm Bolan. And you are? - Avery. - Nice to meet you. - I'm Fishman. I need a dollar. Rock and roll. Let's start. You say you wanna play, but then you sit around and yack all night. - Quigley, just throw. You go first. - I'm up. Don't come from here. Come from here, all right? Feel it, feel it. I'm feeling it, Bolan. - Story of my life. - You weren't feeling it. Watch me. Watch where I come from, OK? Watch where I come from. Centre, centre, centre, centre. I'm feeling that. Tep, throw. - Notice who's going last. - I can't hear with my dick in your mouth. Think about what you're doing, buddy. See, now, Tep's feeling it. He's feeling it! Glad you don't have to listen to this all night? Are you kidding? I'm enjoying this. Haven't been out with the fellas for a long time. This is for the deal? - No. - Can you just throw the dart, please? I think that Avery should get the last shot. - That's fine. - Normally I'd say stay. But tonight it's gonna be a little night, a small night. A couple of hands, tops. I nail it and I don't get nothing? I can't say no to a game of cards, even if it's only one hand. You get a shirt. You get a new shirt. I've got new shirts. Fish, look at this guy. Don't take advantage of him. Come on, Avery. Kick his ass. Kick his ass, Avery! I bet a dollar that Avery kicks your ass. A whole dollar? You're on. Yeah! Oh! He kicked your ass. You owe me a buck. Yeah. Easy five bucks, huh, Avery? - You're still a barely employed alcoholic... - Let's get you out of here. ...make your life tolerable, your little dollar. - Let's play cards. - (Sirens) - I won a buck! - I'll get your stuff. - Hear that? Something is going down! - Who's bleeding? - Tepper, like a girl. - You got your blood on it. - Let me get the rain thing. - That's all? Only one game? - (Fish) Sit down. We're just getting started. - Check it out. - You did win the deal. - Yes, low stakes and somewhat friendly. - I can get you an umbrella. - Sounds tempting. - Yeah, like... - (Fish) This game could use the money. We've got an open chair. Here's your new shirt. Two cop cars right up front, middle of the street, baby. - You don't have to twist my arm. - No! Guys! No. Not tonight. It's just not a good night. I got a lot on my mind and I'm getting engaged tonight. Any other night it would be a good night, but tonight's not a good night. I'm sorry. - Sorry, Tep. You got a lot on your mind. - Cops everywhere, guys. It's all right. It's just not a good night. - Thanks for understanding, Avery. - I didn't mean to overstay my welcome. Is this a poker game or an AA meeting? Everyone's so sorry about everything. - Another night, Avery. Drop by again. - Sure. I won't forget what you did. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Get back in your apartment! Close and lock your door. - Are you deaf? Get your ass back in. - This isn't his apartment. I don't care whose apartment it is. Close the door! - (Door buzzer) - That's gotta be the food. They're gonna seal her up. - Hello. - This is Officer Campbell, NYPD. We've secured your building for police investigation. Do not open your door until you hear from an officer. I should get you out of here before you get stuck in the building. - I'll wait a second. - That is a smart man. They closed off the building. We're on lock-down. - What did I tell you? - Lock that door. I don't wanna get shot. The roof is next and then door to door. Wait. There's one guy that needs to get home. Just real quick, OK, man? - Hello? NYPD? - Avery. I know I know you. - What do you do? - I'm a... - I'm a bus driver. - (Fish) There goes that, Bolan. - (Knocking) - Last bus you took was yellow. Hey, make sure that's a cop. - Mrs Darmsetter, how you doing? - Why are the police here? - I'm trying to find that out myself. - They're all over the place. You go back in and I'll find out what's going on. OK. Hey, Mrs Darmsetter. Lock your door and stay there until I tell you it's OK. - You'll let me know? - Yeah, I'll tell you. OK. I can't believe they could close down an entire building. Only in New York. Look, Avery, I'm sorry. If you want, I'll walk down with you. You didn't hear the cop? We're closed up. He's not going anywhere. He's staying and he's playing. Huh? Am I right, Ave? Well, I must say...it is a convenient excuse. Thank you! Fate throws that in your lap, you've gotta grab it. Am I right? Huh? Avery, let me get that for you. 50-cent max, three-raise limit. Give me cash and I'll give you some chips. Heretofore known as the bank. - Where you going? - Getting something to drink. You got drink. Sit the butt. I'm not a card player. You just tell me when to bet and I'll do it. - That's what I like to hear! - Why don't you get on him for ten bucks? Did you grow a set of balls with that beard? You did have a lucky throw. It's your deal. Oh, uh...somebody else should go first. - I'll deal. - Ah! Deal goes to Grizzly Adams. Six of hearts, six of hearts, six of hearts, six of hearts, six of hearts. - Just deal, Kreskin. - Come on, Quigley, deal. Tep. What's with these cards? They're all the same. I don't know. Carla got them at the MGM Grand in Vegas, Bolan. That's the way they came. It's not a salad. Deal. - Seven-card. No peeky. - Already with the monkey games. - I'll lay wild cards. - Ooh-ooh-ooh! Ah-ah-ah! Monkey games. - Tep! - Sorry. - (Fish) Tep, no peeky. - Guys, it doesn't matter. - It changes the way he bets. - It's OK. I've gotta leave a message with Carla anyway. See? Now he knows he doesn't have a hand. (Bonn) Tep, we' re one card 'm. Hey. When you talk to her, don't forget what I said. (Fish) You'd think this guy's getting circumcised, not engaged. (Quigley) He is getting circumcised. He's getting married. - Hey, what's up? - Sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. Oh, no problem. No problem at all. I gotta get some new silverware. It's getting ridiculous, you know? Listen, I want to thank you again. My whole life was in that wallet. - Well, I'm glad it worked out for you. - Mind if I try again? Oh, yeah, sure. Here you go. Do you mind? You want some privacy. Sure. (Quigley) I was on All My Children. (Bolan) That's Mary's favourite show. - Hello. - You make decent coin doing soaps. A guy in my office hooked up Susan Lucci. Upper East Side. - What block? - Can't tell you. Stalkers and shit. - He doesn't know. - I know where a lot of people live. (Bolan) Oh, come on, Fish. Mary'd love that kind of stuff. Who's gonna stalk Susan Lucci? (Fish) Say I tell you and some freak overhears, goes to Lucci's house and bang, she goes down. Cops, the media, the papers, what happened? Nobody knows. I know. I know 'cause I'm the one that talked. Are you saying that you got code? I got code. What the fuck's the matter with you? I don't rat, I don't cheat and I don't pay for sex. Now deal. In fact, you lose the deal because you took too long. Texas Hold 'Em. (Quigley) I've got a code too. (Fish) It's messed up, but you've got one. Bolan got code so pure, he don't even have to think about it, it just is. But this kid... This kid... Jury's still out on this kid. (Avery) Call him and tell him. (Fish) He doesn't even hear me. (Avery) You have the number? What you looking for, Avery? - I need a pencil. - That's the silverware. - Here you go. Here's a pencil. - Ah! What? Honey, you're right. You call him for me. Thank you, sweetheart. I have to call work and tell them I won't be in tonight. (Fish) Texas Hold 'Em. You in or are you out? - Sure. - (Fish) Put a little hip in that hop. (Bolan) How old are your girls, Avery? One eight, the other just turned ten. October? Same as mine. I got a five-year-old. They're my granddaughters, actually. Living with us for a while. Mine's in Florida, lives with her mom... for now. She's got this prick lawyer, dumb Cuban, going out of his way to make me look bad. I got a job, a suit, a tie. I'm walking the walk. I don't know what the hell else they want. Maybe they want you to move to Florida, be a real father. I would do that, if I ever get out of debt. - You don't know what debt is. - You ever been divorced? No? - Then shut your front door. - Avery, eight and ten's a good age. The eldest one's already into boys and baseball. She's convinced she's gonna marry this Derek Jeter fella. I bet against Jeter once. Once, never again. Kid killed me in the ninth. Oh! So good. Renaissance man, that guy. Avery, does she have an autograph? - Well, how about that? - Think she'd like it? - What's that? - Do you think she'd like to have it? - You already found the guy's wallet. - You've done enough for me already. - It just sits there. - Tep, you love that card. I don't love the card, Fish. It's just a card. (Bolan) Pretty nice offer. (Fish) For a guy you wanted gone. - I'm your best friend. What about me? - Since when? - And you are? - More than you. What's the big deal? Avery, it would make me happy if you took it. (Fish) Damn, Avery. Take the card. - All right. - Fine. That doesn't mean I gotta let you win, does it? All right. Hey, hey, everyone's happy. Can we play some frickin' cards now? - Can you never lust enjoy a nice moment'? - Bone me. Hay cards. Hey, Tep, I tried that elephant-juice thing today. - It works. - (Fish) What's elephant juice? When you say it, it looks like you're saying "I love you“. - I'm the one who told Tep about it. - Sounds like Dumbo coming in your hair. - It's romantic. - It's fifth grade, talking around it. You're getting married and you can't say "I love you“? - I can say it. - When was the last time? - When was the last time you said it? - '89, Paula Valley, Prince concert. We rented a limo, we wore purple and I told her I loved her. - To get in her pants. - No. I meant it. I did get in her pants, but when I said it, I meant it. Well, it's not the same thing. Don't think Carla doesn't know what you're doing, 'cause she knows. I respect you for not saying it if you don't mean it, but if you mean it, say it. Amen to that. Good or bad, truth. Only way t0 9°- (Fish) Right on. (Cop) Roof is secure! - You hear that? - They're on our floor. - (Cop) NYPD. - Apartment search, door to door. - Doing the old lady and we are next. - I've got to use the facility. They'll wanna check the bathroom. - Not if I was just in there. - No need for that. Wait two seconds, say hello, then do your business. - I'll just say a little hello through the door. - (Banging on door) - Yeah, don't worry, Avery. - (Cop) NYPD. - We'll cover for you. - Guy's acting like an ass, huh? Sketchy. (Cop) Simon says, "Open the door.“ Campbell, NYPD. I'm gonna have to look around. All right, Raymond. Come on out! Good thing that the game is not going that late. Raymond! (Whispers) I hate the cops. Who the hell are you? Get out of the tub. I've got a bum leg. Just let me, uh... - Get out. - Let me... Ah! OK, OK. Come on. There we go. Up, up, up. - OK. - There you go. Step out in the other room, hands on the sink. What's the story here? Tep, go ahead. You're the one pointing like an arrow. I don't know. You guys said you were looking for someone. Avery, we just met him. We don't know who he is. As soon as you knocked on the door, he wanted to hide in the bathroom. Three Mary two, three Mary name. Last of Phillips, first of Avery. Avery, you just were acting weird. - We were just trying to be cautious. - Yeah, that's the deal, Officer. You never know about people. You got a driver's licence, something with your face on it? I did. It's not in there? - Nope. - Somebody must have lifted it. I lost my wallet earlier tonight, and Tepper here called me to pick it up. Yeah, it's true. I was just trying to do the right thing. Didn't know it was missing. - You're a fireman, huh? - Retired. I drive a city bus now. New York's bravest. You stub your toe, you're a hero. We get shot, we got it coming. - What's your route? - What's that? Bus route. - Bronx. - Specifically where? Broadway. All right, Avery. You're not who I'm looking for, and I am sorry about that. I'm ready to go home. But I am curious to know why you were hiding. Well, it's kind of complicated. I got a couple of parking tickets. - Parking tickets? - Like I say, it's kind of confusing. See, I'm trying to get them sorted out. I don't know the status. ...Phillips, first of Avery. Two warrants out of Queens. Failure to pay parking tickets. I'll give you an update. They're warrants. That's their status. You're wanted. - You could lose your job. - I'm aware. - You a family man? - Yes. Why jeopardise your livelihood over parking tickets? They were unjust. I'm contesting them. - Well, aren't you the moral one? - You need to arrest me, go ahead. If I decide to rap you with my nightstick upside that brave head, I'll do so. I don't need your permission. All right, consider tonight a gift. Enjoy it. Avery really just wants to go home. His wife is worried. Avery shouldn't have wasted my time. I'll tell you when you can leave, all of you. You gotta be kidding me. You run from the cops, got warrants, you're black and you get off? That doesn't happen. Toto, wake me up. There were some definite power issues going on. Avery, I'm sorry. I wasn't trying to get you in trouble. - I understand. - Hey, what were you trying to do? - What? - What were you trying to do? You guys weren't thinking the same thing? As soon as he heard the knock, he wanted to hide. I don't care what went on, but with all he's got on his mind, I guess it's expected. The fireman's fine, all right? False alarm. Zip it, skip it. Let's play some cards, huh? Come on. - Are you OK? - Yeah. - You sure? - Yeah. Wait a second. Avery Phillips. Avery Phillips. I knew I recognised that name. You're Mr Fire Safety. You spoke at my dad's summer camp, Echo Lake. - Oh, sure! - You're a hero. Hey, this guy's a hero! - Tep, I told you about this, right? - Yeah, that's wild. He saved his partner's life. Pulled his partner out of a hole with his leg, this man. - With his frickin' leg. - A long time ago. So if you're such a hero, then why do they got you driving buses? Well...you know, it's... I've got a pretty big family to feed. Disability just doesn't go far enough, so... Say...Mr Fire Safety... I don't know if you heard, but my dad passed a year and a half ago... - Aw, gee, I'm sorry, man. - Oh, no, thank you. I'm running the camp now, and we're doing great. We got all these kids with special needs and... - God, we just gotta get you back to camp. - OK, story time's over. What do you say we play a little poker, huh? Any poker at this point! Wild cards, seven-card. Peeky, no peeky. I just wanna play some cards. Please? Thank you. You know, I say we play Last Man, juice things up a bit, huh? - We haven't played regular yet. - You're not the boss. - You're not the boss of us. - So regular after? - I thought you didn't give a deuce. - We play for lottery tickets. Last man standing takes them all. Do you have a ticket? Yes. Actually, Avery, why don't we trade places here? This seat's gonna be more comfortable. I can sit over here in Coop's seat there. Oh, that's nice. I like that. It's soft. You are unbelievable. Tep, let's go. Ante in. What? Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah. - I'm not in this week. - The hell you aren't. - I forgot to buy a ticket. - That's bullshit. You're in. - I'm serious. It just slipped my mind. - You don't have a ticket at all? Sorry. I meant to buy one on my way home, but then I found Avery's wallet and I guess I just forgot. Well, then, I guess you don't mind if we check in your little hiding spot? - Go ahead. - It's not that we don't believe you. (Tepper) I've got nothing to hide, Quigley. How do you live with yourself? And how'd you forget? For the tenth time, Bolan, I just forgot. It happens. You know what? That's lame. You should be penalised for that. - What's the big damn deal? - The big deal is that's the way we play. Yeah. J' That's the way Uh-huh, uh-huh, we play it ♪ Front pocket. What's that? Left side, shirt pocket. What are you talking about? - Empty the pocket. - Fuck you. - (Bolan) Yo, Tep. - Yo, Bolan. What? - (Fish) Empty the pocket! - What's in the pocket? - What's in the pocket? - Stay away! - For crying out loud! - Guys! It's time to settle down, OK? - We're supposed to be having fun. - This isn't camp, Bolan. I came here to play cards. I am tired of screwing around. Tepper, you're acting more Quigley than Quigley. - I am sick of you bagging on me. - Why are you doing this? - We know you got a ticket. - You guys are dicks. - We're dicks? - (Bolan) We're dicks? - Like you never bought an extra ticket. - Extra tickets? Buy a frickin' hundred extra tickets for all I care. All you need is one, for here. I didn't have any time to buy extra ones. This one's for Carla, for tonight. - Maybe he's got a winner. - Yeah, that's it. - That's it. I got a winner. - If he had a winner, he wouldn't be here. - You really think I do? - I hope you got frequent flyer miles. - You're all over the frickin' map. - Call them if you do. - I don't want this hanging over my head. - For crying out loud. - Seriously, Fish. Call them up. - Fine! All right. You want me to call 'em? Fine, I'll call 'em. I wanted to do something special for my girlfriend. If I may. When trust between friends is broken, it can never be repaired. If you challenge him and you're wrong, that could haunt this group for ever. Avery's right. This is stupid. It's so frickin' ridiculous. Sit the butt. Let's settle this. The rule is you don't look, ever, fOf any reason. That's the rule, and it's very simple. Quigley...look me in the eye. Did you check the numbers? I never have. Bolan, I know the answer, but I have to ask. No. - Tep? Avery, I don't know you, but I'll trust you. If you know the numbers, you can't play. Do you know them? No. OK, then. What about you? No. I never have and I never will. Right? Let's play Last Man Standing. Avery, you get this, right? You know you could lose your ticket, winner or not? I think I understand the game. No mistaking which is yours. I'm sorry, guys. I don't know what my problem is tonight. I know what your problem is. You're scared, and you ought to be. Doing what you're doing is risky. No, it's only risky if you pick the wrong woman. You haven't. It's just marriage. It doesn't mean for ever. One way or the other, it'll be over soon. Not soon enough. Let's play some cards! All right, Avery, it's a very simple game. Five-card draw. I deal counterclockwise. Low man out on each hand. Stay off the bottom and you stay alive. Mm-hm. That deck ever make its way around to me? No, Fish always deals Last Man. He doesn't trust anybody. We indulge him. New rule. From here on out, anyone gets up for any reason, you're out. All right? Ag reed? Hey, you guys. Does anybody smell that? That's cat piss. Tep, we need some Renuzit. Uh-oh. Witch Doctor's got a good hand. What you got, Witch Doctor, huh? A pair? Maybe two? Why you call me that? You call me that every week. What's it mean? Huh? - You wanna know? - OK. All right. Seeing how's everyone's coming clean, starting fresh, I'll let you in on a little secret, all you guys. One reason I constantly kick your ass and you'll remember me come Christmas. Quigley, every time you have a good hand, you start spinning things, just like this, twisting it around. Yeah. Dead giveaway. It's a tell, tells me all I need to know. Everyone's got one. You don't know you're doing it. You just do it. Perfect example, Bolan. Every time Bolan is bluffing, he starts tapping his foot like he's got palsy, like he's screaming, "Look at me! I'm lying!' I guarantee you he's got nothing. First one out, I bet you anything. Tepper, on the other hand, like a Russian novel, very hard to read. Especially tonight. Need a Geiger counter for him. Yeah, you don't show much, Tep. I haven't figured yours out yet. What's yours? I got done telling you it's unconscious. If I knew, I wouldn't do it. That's why it's called a giveaway. Unbelievable. I hand you the keys to the kingdom and you can't even walk through the door. All right, big man. Avery, how many do you want? - Three. - Three for the big man. Witch Doctor? Quigley. You got two pair, going for that little full house? - Just play. - Bolan? One, two, three, four cards. Thank you. Tep? Don't need a tell to read that. The man takes three, dealer takes three. That stinks. I can't believe you guys don't smell that. _ (Fish) Whgtoh! YOu got A u Ve? Pair of sixes. Not too strong, but strong enough to stay in the game, I'm betting. - Huh, Bolan? What you got, Quigley? - What's that? Witch Doctor working the mojo. Two pair! All you gotta do is beat two sixes. What you got, Bolan? Oh, the queen. Tep, all you gotta do is beat a queen to stay alive. And he does. A pair of threes. Tough way to start the game, huh, Bo? - What have you got? - Let's see here. What do I have? - There's one boy. - Oh, here we go. Starting early. Oh! And there's another. The pair of boys kicks the shit out of your bitch. Bluffer holds true to form. One down, three to go. See how it works? Last man alive gets the pot. That cat piss is killing me. I'm gonna open a window. - You're out. - (Bolan) Yes! - What? - You're up, you're out. - No, it's you can't get up during a hand. - Bye-bye. - Guys, it worked. - What bullshit. Bullshit. No, Bolan, it didn't work. I was doing it for everybody. No, check it out. It didn't smell like cat piss. I just said it did. I suggested it. You should have been at that seminar, buddy. What the fuck are you talking about? Come on! - You guys are rough. - Enough of this Mickey Mouse crap. This coming from a guy who calls seven-card "no peeky“. Can I get a little credit here? I think I should have been on All My Children. Come on. Tep, back me up here, huh? It's called tough love. Embrace it. Whatever. I don't care, anyway. (Fish) Yeah, uh-huh. That leaves three of us. All right! We got A, old and wise, B, good-looking and young and C, all of the above. Let's just see what happens, shall we, boys? - Pow! How you feel about that one? - Bingo. - (Fish) Look at 'em! - I got a little something in the window. Oh, he's peeping again. Bolan, please. Go suggest he jump. Two girls. One's clothed, one's in her bra. They're trying on clothes. She is definitely 18. - Bolan, check that out. - No, thank you. They've got the window open. They want you to look. - (Bolan) How high up do you think we are? - How high are you? You sure you don't wanna take a look, Fish? A little coquette in the window just for you. We're playing for six million bucks. No time for high-school peep-shows. OK, we're down to panties now. We're down to panties now. And you can see right through them. I won't tell anyone. Give it a shot. - Maybe I'll spot the food guy. - Spot the food guy. Spot the food guy. I've always questioned the fascination of voyeurism, you know. Must be one's lack of... Holy Mother of God! Oh, shit! You knew! You knew! The one time I looked... The one time. (Quigley) Welcome to my seminar. I wanna show you my favourite one. - Avery, how many you want? - Two. (Fish) Ein, zwei. How do those feel, Avery? They feel sexy, those cards? Tep? - God. on, God. - on, Christ. - Just deal. - Go clean that thing up. - I'm not leaving the table. - I'll watch the tickets. It's making me sick. - You sure? - Yeah, I'm sure. Hurry. Go. - (Fish) God! - This means you're out. It's worse than puberty. This kid's like a rabid dog. - Just going on what you said. - Under the circumstances... - Like a home-court advantage. - You can call it that. Hold up. Avery, you want the tickets that bad, just take 'em. Hold on a second. Clip the lip. First, I'm still in this game. Second, no one's out. I said he could go. - What's going on? - You're the king? I didn't agree to anything. - You don't have a vote! - Fish, wait... - I got a ticket. I figure I got a vote. - You figure wrong, old man! Don't come to my game and tell me how it's played! - Back off! - You're out. He's up, he's out. - He's not out. - If I'm out, he's out. - You're out too. - I told him he could get up. When did you become a pit boss? Every single time you change the rules. - You're not the boss! - Guys... You know what we do when the kids can't get along? We end the game. - Bolan, relax. - (Fish) Don't panic. Then stop your inching whining! You're worse than my kids. Now, I'll be the arbiter, OK? That's fine. What I say goes. No arguing, no debating. - Just call... - Just shut up for once. Avery... Are you gonna be OK with my call? Sure. He's not out. (Fish) He's not out, meaning he's still in. - So, I'm in, right? - Yes, you're in. All right. This is fun. (Quigley) Do you have to say that every five minutes? "For crying out loud.“ - (Fish) So what? - So it's annoying. (Fish) So, uh...grow up. (Quigley) You're an ass, Fishman. (Fish) And you can moonwalk back to fuck me. (Fish plucks tune on comb) Having fun yet, Avery? Must be great having kids, huh? Kids are wonderful. First time around...it's great. Now that I got the granddaughters, light of my life, I'd do anything for my girls. (Quigley) I bet you would. You know, all day I'm at camp working with my kids, but... ...but I don't have any of my own...yet. I got all these people telling me that I'm not ready. (Bolan) I feel like you're only not ready if you haven't lived enough life for yourself. I have. I want 'em. My wife and I are having a little trouble getting pregnant. So I was at this clinic today, and this nurse puts me in this little room and gives me... ...Big Butt magazine. So, I do my thing and... ...when I'm done, I peep my head out and I... "What do I do with this container?“ This nurse says, "Leave it on the shelf.“ "I'm sorry?" "I mean, my self-esteem is at an all-time low, you know?“ "I'm in a little green closet with Big Butt magazine, "suspecting that my semen isn't potent, "and you want me to leave it on the shelf?" So I left it on the shelf. (Fish plucks tune on comb) Well, what did you do with the magazine? What's he doing in there? - (Knocking) - “h. Yeah'? Hey. How can you stand Fishman? He's ridiculous. - I gotta whizz. - Sure, go ahead. Fishman. Tep, I literally can't do this with you standing behind me. There he is. Avery and I made up. BFF. Best friends forever. Sit it and play some cards. (Upbeat music plays) That's disgusting. What are the chances that one of these is a winner? One in nine hundred million. Shh. Tep, I'm gonna call my daughter. I've got one of those calling cards. All right, Tep. How many you want? - Three. - Three. Dealer takes three. (Fish) That's right, Avery. I'm coming to get you. All righty. (Fish) Let's tum 'em. Avery, what you got? Oh. Not bad for a fireman hero turned bus driver with two outstanding warrants. A, B, C. Tep, your tum. (Fish's voice echoes) Roll them and show them. Tepper? Roll them and show them. Let's do it. (Quigley) Ah! Bitch! I get my daughter her own phone line so I can talk to her. Her mother takes it off the hook every night. Nice, huh? Fantastic. Tep! Stop with the drama. Roll your cards, please. Tonight would be fantastic. I will. Am I missing something? I'll make it easy on you, Tepper. So you start with a pair of threes, and then you go right in to the pair of eights. Bang, bang, boom. (Fish) Come on, Tep. Can you do it? (Tepper) Well... I think I can...Fish. - (Quigley) I think he's pulling a Fishman. - I believe I have...these two aces, Fish. And, oh, what's this? What's happening? Oh, oh, and a third one. - (Fish) Did you have two and draw one? - Something like that. I got lucky. Something I never have been. Unbelievable. I lose with two fricking pair? I can't buy a fricking break. Where's the phone? I gotta cancel a bet. - I'll deal. - Let Houdini deal. I gotta get a plan. - There's a surprise. - What? Nothing. I'm gonna deal. Damn! Feels like a deck and a half in here. Let's use a new deck for the last hand. Yeah, tell him Paul Fishman's on the line. Yes, I'll hold. You know, the funny thing about lottery tickets, it's such a leap of faith. I've been playing the lottery for ten years now. One ticket every week for ten years, and I always play the same numbers. I'd sooner forget my birthday than my lottery numbers. I always buy them from the same little Korean fella. He's got a place right across the street from our church, and every Sunday, after I thank the Lord for my blessings, I sneak in a little prayer for myself. I say, "Dear Lord, this week let me win.“ And then I take the girls across the street and buy 'em juice from the little Korean fella and buy my lottery ticket. The odd thing about this Sunday... the little fella wasn't there. Sick or something. First time in ten years. I buy the ticket anyway from his wife. Same numbers, but a different hand punching them into the computer. And I say to myself, "Is this a sign?“ "Could this be the week I'm gonna win?“ Maybe the good Lord knew I needed a different hand typing in the tickets, so he made the little guy sick just so I could win. Then I go and lose the ticket and you find it. And here you are gambling it in a poker game. Now, here's where the faith comes in. If the good Lord intended me to win, and mine is the winning ticket, I'm walking outta here with it. Because he wouldn't do that, play a trick on me like that. 'Cause he's too busy screwing with me. Deal, Quigley. You tell him Fishman's calling back in two minutes and he better pick up the phone. I have the only bookie in New York with a frickin' receptionist! Hands on the table, fellas. I don't want any controversy. Guys, think we'll still be playing poker in 50 years? - God, I hope not. - Then take your time. Six million reasons not to screw this up. (Gentle music plays) - I think we should split it if someone wins. - (Fish) Since when? I've always thought that. Especially after everything that's gone on tonight. - (Fish) Then why even play? - I don't know, Fish. For the fun of it. What is it with fun tonight? This is gambling. There's winners and there's losers. Yes, I'll hold. (Knocking) (Quigley) How many, Ave? Oner for Ave. - (Fish) I called a half-hour ago. - Hi, Mrs Darmsetter. - Tep, how many? - You've done it for me before. - Honey? - What? Do you think they'd know to check the basement, the police? - Draw time. Let's go. How many? - Tep, Mrs Darmsetter. - I don't know. I'm sure they do. - You can't do me this one thing?! - Remember the exterminator? - How many? He didn't know, and he's worked here for years. - How many? - Pissing me off! So, if he didn't know, how are they going to know? - Unbelievable. - Draw, Tep. - I don't know, but they know, OK? - How many? (Bolan) Hello? (Fish) Double my bet. - How many? - I want six bills on SC tomorrow. - Maybe you should say something. - How many? I'd say something, but they're not gonna listen to me, an old lady. - (Fish) Little bitch. - Tepper? - Pissing me off, this guy. - The exterminator... - Where's your head at? - Maybe if you said something. Would you put a fucking sock in it?! Oh, God, I'm sorry. Mrs Darmsetter, I'm sorry. I didn't mean that. Oh, God, I didn't mean that. I'm having a rough night here. I would never hurt you. I would never, ever hurt you. I'm so sorry. You know that, right? You believe me, right? This isn't about you. What happened just now was not about you. You scared me. I know I did. I've never seen you like this. Yeah. Yeah, me neither. Could you please forgive me? I forgive you. Maybe you wanna stay here and watch some TV? No, I guess I'd better get back. You know, in case somebody calls. Are you sure you're all right? I'm OK. (Tapper) Goodnight. (Quigley) I dealt you already. Ave? (Fish whistles) Tep? I got nothing. - You got a flush. - Hey, huh? You don't draw three for a flush in a two-man game. That's idiotic. You don't deserve to win. The chances of that happening are, like, zero. - Get out of my seat. - Take your tickets. You don't play like that when my money's on the table. I'm gonna check the numbers. - (Tepper) I'll do it. - That's OK, I got it. - Quigley, give me the phone now. - OK, it's ringing. Still want to split it? Tonight's Big 3 jackpot is worth six million dollars. The winning numbers are 10, 23, 91. To hear the numbers again, press one. - No winners. - Hey, thank God for that. - (Knocking) - Oh, you gotta be kidding me. Will you get the door, Bolan? All right. It turns out you guys are not the biggest idiots in the building. Raymond got himself stuck in the garbage chute, ass-end up. I live off 229th. I'm gonna keep an eye out for you. Now you can leave. Thank you, Officer Campbell. Finally, we can play some frickin' cards. Too late, Tep. No take-backs. What's done is done. - (Fish) What are you doing? - Going home. - No. It's still early yet. - Not for me. - (Fish) Bolan. - Yeah, I gotta call it, too. (Fish) We've only played one fricking hand all night! - (Tepper) We can go again tomorrow. - I can't. Tonight's my poker night. Oh! Hey, guys, I'm cabbing it. Anybody wanna share? I'm so tired of humping this fricking ride. Guess it wasn't in the cards today, huh, Fish? And the sun set on another day you gave head to. But what does that do for me, huh? Avery, it was nice to meet you. Guys. (Fish) Later, Bolan. (Quigley) Bye. (Fish) Hey, you want your cash? I guess that's for me. You probably wanna get going too, huh, Avery? Let me get your jacket and stuff. Ain't no need to rush off just yet. (T epper and Quigley shout) Sorry. This had to happen. Did you see how smooth I was? Three clubs, like butter off a spoon. - I'm gonna get help. - I'm Kreskin, motherfucker. - (Quigley) Come on! - What the frick? - (Tepper) It's OK. - Son of a bitch. - We got an emergency. 411, West 13th. - Tep, Tep, Tep. No, no, no. - That doesn't work. - Get away from me! - Hang up the phone! - ( Tepper) We got an emergency... - We got six million dollars, goddammit! - What are you...? We got a winner. I'm protecting our money. We got a winning ticket. - You said no winners, Tep. - He lied. - Bolan'd never go for it. - Why you doing this? - It's his ticket, and he can prove it. - What are you talking about? Fireman Fred plays his granddaughter's birthday. Neither one of you caught that, did you? No. I did. I did. Quigley did. Show him the ticket, Tep. Show him the ticket. First number, 10, month, October. Second, number, 23, day. Last number, 91, year. October 23, 1991. He plays his granddaughter's birthdays and he's been doing it for ten years. And don't think for a fucking second that all his neighbours don't know about it. Probably planning a big old barbecue right about now, huh? We got no choice. We got no choice here. Think about it. Four white boys. Four white boys rip off a...a black man. A hero, no less. We're fucked! At the least, we have Al Sharpton up our asses. Plus this is the kind of guy who doesn't even quit his job! - Screw that! - (Distant sirens) - Screw that, OK? - (Avery groans) - OK. Here. - I'm quitting. I'm getting my daughter back. You can do whatever you want. - It's gonna be all right. - (Quigley) Oh! Oh, God! It's him or us. I'll do it. I'll do it. What...? - Stop it! - Stop what? It was your idea! - Stop it! - (Door buzzer) - Stop! Look at him! - You guys, shut up! Stop it! (Carla, laughing) Hey, hey. It's me. Let me in, baby. I'm drenched. (Carla groans) (Carla sighs) I wanted to look so good for you, too. Can I tell you something? I am really nervous. I know it probably sounds silly, but it's like our first date all over again. You have to let me in. My key's jammed. Tep, don't bring Carla up here. It's not a good place for her, not now. What are you doing up there? I am freezing. Let's go. Let me in. (Avery groans) - Help me with him. - I don't care if the guys are still there. I'm sure they know everything that's going on anyway. I'm trying real hard to give you the benefit of the doubt. Come on. I've waited six months for tonight. Tep, if you have something to say to me, then just say it. Don't leave me standing out here. You know what the problem is? You never chose me. I asked you out. I kissed you first. I wanted to get married. You never once took the initiative with anything. You just let it happen. Now you're doing it again, aren't you? Well, I'm tired of waiting. I'm tired of spending every moment trying to figure out what it is you want and how I can be that. I'm just tired. We'll straighten it all out tomorrow, Tep. All right? I promise you, we'll straighten it out tomorrow. No, you won't. Fish, it won't be straightened out tomorrow. What are we doing, man? - We're friends, Fish. What are we doing? - Oh, come on! Yeah. You're friends. Since when do friends cheat each other? Yep, I caught that too, Tep. Since you're feeling all righteous tonight, tell Fish just how good a friend you are. See, I figured out your tell. When you're lying, you look him straight in the eye. Yep. He cheated you, Fish. He looked you straight in the eye and cheated you three aces. You cheated me, Tep? I did. I'm sorry, Fish. You dumb-asses. Hm? 30 years I've been waiting for a break, and you screw it up in a night. That's what the wallet was all about? Jesus, Tep. You smashed his head 'cause he's a threat to you? Did you listen to a word he said all night? He's got a wife and kids, man. We know where he lives. You don't have to hurt a guy like that. Now...you know, now it's a problem. Avery... You're a problem. Not if we split it. Look, I'm a poor man today, but tomorrow I'll be a millionaire. Either way, huh? Just want a fair share. See? Now, there's a man who's thinking. He's living in the moment. Half his head's frickin' gone, and he's smarter than all three of us put together. Avery, I don't wanna threaten you. I know what that feels like. But if we do this, and you tum on us... I don't want anybody else hurt. Right. (Fish) I got no problem with that. (Quigley) I'm good with that, too. (TePPer) No. We're not splitting it. What? Ten minutes ago, you were Johnny Split-It-All. Are you the moral majority now? Am I in the fricking 700 Club? - (Quigley) We're splitting it, Tep. - It's his. - It was his to begin with. - No, Tep. You found the wallet. That ticket became yours, and then you bet it in a game. - We're splitting it. - We're splitting it. You ought to be happy about it, seeing as how you cheated me. Don't complicate this, Tepper, please. This is the best way to do it. We've all got something on each other. No one's gonna talk. It'd hurt us all. So I'm gonna take the ticket. I'll cash it out. I'll divvy it up. See, I can handle that. We're not splitting it. It's his, and he's leaving with it. No. What is this, Tepper, huh? Come on. This is about you feel guilty, Tep? Because if you feel guilty, give us the ticket. (Quigley) Give us the ticket, Tep. I'm doing this 'cause it needs doing. Take your ticket, Avery. I appreciate the gesture, but this doesn't seem decided yet. - It's not that simple, is it? - (Knocking) (Campbell) Guess who? Tick, tick. Open the door. (Banging) I was two blocks away from getting clocked out. - I should have run the light. - I told you they'd come. Officer, I'm sorry. I'm... This is a little embarrassing. I'm the one who called, actually. I... - I panicked. - What happened to you? (Laughs) Like he said, he panicked. We were rough-housing and I took a header. - The little shit panics. - I thought he was hurt. - (Fish) He just panicked. - So he said. I've grown tired of you guys. - I called 911. - I'm all out of gold stars. - Work it out with your buddies. - 'Cause I did something illegal. I wanna confess. (Tepper) I'm sorry, Fish. (Campbell) You wise guys. I am finishing a very long week. I got daughters waiting to spend time with their dad. You are cutting into my quality time. This ticket...belongs to Avery. (Tapper) Not me and not us. Well, then, I suggest you give it to him. The problem is...it's a winner. (Tepper) It's worth six million dollars. If I give this to you, will you see that Avery gets home safely with it? Courtesy, professionalism and respect. That's me. (Fish) Nice. This your ticket? - Yes, sir. - Does that mean it's stolen property? Look, I just want what's fair. There's no problem. Oh, but there is a problem. See, I wanted to get outta here. I wanted you guys to settle this thing on your own. I got family at home. But like a boil on my ass, you guys just wouldn't go away. Whether you wanna press charges or not, I have all the paperwork to do. Procedure. I'm sure you know about that. I'll do it Monday. You'll find it in Lost Property with your name on it, Avery. Yeah, and I'm ten inches. Are you bragging or are you doubting my word? Just another dirty cop, huh? Maybe you're right. Paperwork does have a way of getting misplaced. You girls have a nice night. Tepper, please tell me you just pulled a fast one and we're about to work this out like men. Right? You didn't just give a New York City cop a six-million-dollar lottery ticket, right? Right? I did the right thing, Fish. You did. Oh. For crying out loud. You did. Congratulations, Tep. You just got code. I just wish it could have been tomorrow. Nice knowing you, Avery. Call her. I appreciate what you tried to do. I did the right thing. What? Oh! Oh! Son of a... Oh! God! There's no mistaking this ticket, is there? God! OK. - Son of a bitch! - You better get home to your wife, Avery. - Let me get the door. - Oh, what's this? What's this? Hey... Oh! Oh! (Laughs) on, God. This is Big Brother Bolan sending the good love out to my two favourite people. (Gentle music plays) Hey, it's Carla. Leave a message and I'll call you back. Hey, it's me. I love you. And I hope it's not too little, too late. I love you. (Knocking) How you doing? You called my brother-in-law Victor about my wallet.
