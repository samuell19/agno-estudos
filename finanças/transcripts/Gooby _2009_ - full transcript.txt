[ *** ] [ *** ] Boy: [ Narrating ] BY THE TIME YOU'RE 11, YOU PRETTY MUCH KNOW WHICH PLACES ARE GOOD, AND WHICH ARE BAD. TAKE MY NEIGHBOURHOOD. IT'S GOOD. VERY GOOD. PROBABLY BECAUSE I'VE GROWN UP HERE MY WHOLE LIFE. ON ONE END, THERE'S HOT DOG PARK. THAT'S WHAT MY MOM AND I CALLED IT. WE USED TO GO THERE EVERY FRIDAY AFTER SCHOOL. AND ON THE OTHER END, THERE'S THE CONVENIENCE STORE. WHEN I WAS REALLY LITTLE, MY DAD AND I USED TO WALK HERE FOR THE BIG SUNDAY PAPER. THEN, THERE'S CHESTER STREET. THE BEST STREET IN THE WHOLE WORLD. AND RIGHT HERE... MY HOUSE. IT'S MY CAVE FORTRESS AGAINST ALL THE BAD THINGS IN THE UNIVERSE. THEY SAY I HAVE AN OVERACTIVE IMAGINATION. BUT I DON'T THINK SO, I JUST SEE THINGS GROWN-UPS DON'T. I USED TO BE SCARED OF THE SUPER ELECTRIFIED PTERODACTYLS THAT LIVE IN THE QUARRY JUST OUTSIDE TOWN. BUT NOW, I KNOW THAT'S FOR KIDS. IF ANYTHING, THEY'RE LIVING IN THE WOODS JUST BEHIND SCHOOL. THE BIGGEST THREAT THESE DAYS ARE BLUE, THEY HAVE TWO HEADS, AND THEY'RE NOT FROM THIS PLANET. I CALL THEM HOONIES. THE WAY I FIGURE IT THOUGH... AS LONG AS I'M IN MY SAFE PLACE, THEY CAN'T GET ME... EXCEPT... Woman: WILLY? Man: WILLY! Willy: DAD! I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE... BOB. JACK DANDRIDGE. YEAH, MY PARTNER ROLLIE BROUGHT UP SOME FINAL POINTS... Woman: WILLY? Jack: YEAH, THEY'RE IN... THE LAST PAGES. YEAH? JACK, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GET THESE DOWN TO THE CITY REGISTRY BY 5:00. Jack: YEAH, I'LL DO IT ON THE WAY TO THE OFFICE. BIG SURPRISE. ARE YOU READY? WHAT'S GOING ON? CLOSE YOUR EYES. OKAY. OUR NEW HOUSE, WILLY. OUR DREAM HOUSE. [ *** ] YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT? Willy: [ Narrating ] THAT MOMENT, I KNEW MY WHOLE WORLD HAD JUST FALLEN APART. Woman: THIS HAS GONE ON LONG ENOUGH, OKAY? WE'RE MOVING TODAY! BUT YOU'RE WRECKING ALL MY STUFF! UNBELIEVABLE! SIX WEEKS WE'VE BEEN DEALING WITH THIS. YOU'RE WAY TOO OLD FOR THIS BEHAVIOUR. WAY, WAY TOO OLD! BUT THOSE ARE MY BATTLE PLANS AND MY MODELS. AND THIS IS MY AMULET OF FIRE. IT KEEPS ME SAFE FROM DANGER. OKAY, WILLY... WHAT'S SO TERRIBLE ABOUT MOVING? TELL ME. YOU'LL GET MAD. TRY ME. IF WE MOVE INTO THE NEW HOUSE, BAD THINGS WILL HAPPEN. LIKE HOONIES. FOR REAL. REMEMBER WHAT DR. CHAPMAN SAID? SHE SAID IT'S ALL HALLUCINATIONS AND MY OVERACTIVE IMAGINATION. BUT WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME SHE HAD TO FIGHT OFF EVIL SPACE MONKEYS? NEVER! COME ON, LITTLE MAN, LET'S GO THROUGH IT. [ Sigh ] "THE ONLY THING TO FEAR IS FEAR ITSELF". AND? "WHAT MY IMAGINATION CREATES IS WITHIN MY CONTROL". ALL RIGHT, SO... THAT BEING THE CASE, THESE... UH... CAN GO... IN HERE. AND THESE CAN GO... BUT, THOSE ARE THE DESIGNS FOR MY SUPER SPACE CART! DAD AND I ARE GOING TO BUILD IT THIS FALL. AND YOU'LL GET THEM BACK WHEN WE MOVE INTO THE NEW HOUSE. THIS HOUSE MEANS A LOT TO US. WE'RE FINALLY... FINALLY GOING TO HAVE THE LIFE WE ALWAYS DREAMED OF. IT'S NOT MY DREAM. [ Thunder rumbling ] [ Sigh ] OKAY, WELL... OH. WHAT ABOUT HIM? HE USED TO HELP YOU OUT A LOT IN THE PAST. GOOBY? MOM, I PLAYED WITH HIM WHEN I WAS PRACTICALLY A BABY! YOU THINK SOME TOY I PLAYED WITH WHEN I WAS A BABY IS GOING TO HELP ME NOW? HELP ME OUT HERE, WILLY, I'M TRYING MY BEST. Jack: ELISE! YEAH! HEY, THESE GUYS ARE ALMOST DONE DOWN HERE. I'VE GOT TO POP BY THE OFFICE ON THE WAY OVER. I MAY HAVE TO GO TO BALTIMORE AGAIN TOMORROW. YES, OKAY. WILLY. LOOK AT ME. YOU'RE GOING TO MOVE INTO A BIG, BEAUTIFUL HOUSE, AND YOU'RE GOING TO GO TO A NEW SCHOOL AND YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE NEW FRIENDS, ALL RIGHT? I DON'T KNOW HOW TO MAKE FRIENDS. SO IT'S A... IT'S A NEW CHAPTER FOR ALL OF US. WE'RE ALL GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE SOME CHANGES. ALL OF US. ALL RIGHT? TRUST ME, IT'S GOING TO BE WONDERFUL. Willy: [ Narrating ] PARENTS CAN SAY THAT THINGS ARE GOING TO BE WONDERFUL ALL THEY WANT, BUT THEY DON'T REALLY KNOW. I WAS LEAVING THE ONLY SAFE PLACE I HAD KNOWN MY WHOLE LIFE. [ *** ] [ *** ] Jack: COME ON, ROLLIE, YOU'RE THE ONE WHO SAID HE WAS GOING TO TALK TO THE MAN. LOOK... I'VE GOT TO GO. Willy: [ Narrating ] WHEREVER WE WERE GOING, I JUST COULDN'T GET RID OF THE FEELING THAT THERE WERE BAD THINGS TO COME... AND WE WERE NEVER GOING TO BE THE SAME AGAIN. [ *** ] [ *** ] [ Heavy sigh ] [ *** ] Jack: WHAT DO YOU SAY WE CHECK OUT THE BACKYARD? [ *** ] THINK WE CAN FIT A POOL BACK HERE OR WHAT? NICE. I LIKE IT WHEN WE GO TO THE Y. IF WE HAVE OUR OWN POOL, WE DON'T NEED THE Y, DO WE? RIGHT? AND HOW ABOUT THAT? THAT OLD SHED WOULD MAKE A PRETTY GOOD FORT, I'D SAY. FORTS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE IN A TREE. YOU BUILD THEM YOURSELF. THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID. AND WE WILL. WILLY... BUDDY... THINGS CHANGE, OKAY? BUT CHANGE... IS GOOD. LOOK, WHEN JOEY'S DAD AND I STARTED THE BUSINESS, I MEAN, THAT WAS A CHANGE, RIGHT? AND NOW THIS GUY WANTS TO BUY US UP... THAT'S A CHANGE, BUT THAT'S GOOD. [ Dog barking ] Man: THERE'S NOTHING STRANGE THERE, NOTHING AT ALL. WHAT'S WITH YOU ANYWAY? HEY THERE! HE ONLY BARKS WHEN THERE'S A CHANGE IN THE WEATHER. LOOKS LIKE A PRETTY NICE DAY TO ME. YEAH, WELL, SOMETHING'S UPSET HIM. Eerie voice: WILLY... [ Gasp ] [ Barking ] [ *** ] [ Snarling ] Jack: THERE SHE IS. [ Barking ] WILLY. THIS IS MRS. WILLIAMS. AND HOW ARE YOU, YOUNG MASTER DANDRIDGE? MRS. WILLIAMS IS GOING TO LOOK AFTER YOU IN THE AFTERNOONS. LOOK AFTER ME? YEAH, YOUR MOM'S GOING BACK TO THE LAW FIRM FULL-TIME FOR A WHILE. OH, BUT I'M SURE WILLY AND I ARE GOING TO BECOME THE BEST OF FRIENDS, AREN'T WE? Willy: [ Narrating ] LIKE I SAID... THIS HOUSE MEANT TROUBLE. [ Water running ] Eerie voice: WILLY... [ Chattering/snarling ] [ *** ] [ Growling ] [ *** ] [ *** ] AW, COME ON, GIVE ME A BREAK! HOW OLD ARE YOU AGAIN? [ Creaking ] [ Banging ] [ Clatter ] [ Wind whistling ] [ *** ] [ *** ] [ Straining ] [ Panting ] [ *** ] HELP ME. PLEASE, HELP ME TO BE SAFE. [ Smack ] [ *** ] Willy: [ Narrating ] WHAT I HAD NO WAY OF KNOWING WAS THAT BACK IN MY OLD HOUSE, SOMETHING REALLY WEIRD WAS HAPPENING. [ *** ] HE HAD TO GO TO BALTIMORE FROM BOSTON SO WE'RE NOT GOING TO SEE HIM TILL FRIDAY. C... COULD YOU PLEASE HURRY UP? I HAVE AN 11:00 O'CLOCK MEETING AND THE TEACHER WAS GOOD ENOUGH TO SEE US AFTER FIRST BELL, OKAY? I'LL TAKE CARE OF THAT, MA'AM. YOU TEND TO YOURSELF. Elise: OH, UH... OKAY, THANKS. FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL. IT'S NOT SO EASY. HMM? I KNOW. THEY ALWAYS TEASED ME. TEASED... TEASED AND TEASED. SOMETIMES, WORSE. [ Knife clatters ] WAIT. I KNOW I PUT TWO... YOU AND ME ARE GOING TO GET ALONG, AREN'T WE? [ Bag crinkling ] WE CAN HAVE IT OUT RIGHT NOW, BOY, IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT. WHAT DID YOU DO? I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING! I WILL NOT TOLERATE LYING. LYING? HOW COME WHEN EITHER OF YOU ASK ME TO... TELL THE TRUTH AND I TELL IT, YOU ALWAYS TELL ME I'M LYING? I'M SORRY, MRS. WILLIAMS. YOU! MOVE. BUT I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING! [ Class bell ringing ] Willy: [ Narrating ] OF COURSE, A NEW HOUSE MEANS A NEW SCHOOL, AND A NEW SCHOOL IS ALMOST WORSE THAN HOONIES. Woman: WILLY DANDRIDGE, BOYS AND GIRLS. NOW, WILLY, YOU'LL SIT OVER THERE BETWEEN THOMAS AND KELSEY. [ Chair clatters ] [ Laughter ] [ Mixed whispers ] Boy: [ Whispering ] HE'S WEIRD! [ Chuckles ] NOW, FOR THE PROBLEM ON THE BOARD. [ Shouts of play ] OVER THERE... THAT'S COLIN MEYER. THE MOST POPULAR GUY IN SCHOOL. IF YOU DON'T KNOW THAT GUY, YOU'RE NOBODY. AND OVER THERE... BIG BRUCE. Big Bruce: WHERE'S YOUR LUNCH-MONEY, HUH? YOU REALLY WANT TO AVOID BIG BRUCE. YOU BETTER NOT BE TRYING TO HIDE IT. [ *** ] Willy: [ Narrating ] OKAY, FIRST THE COOKIES, THEN MY LUNCH. I KNEW EXACTLY WHAT WAS GOING ON. OBVIOUSLY, THERE ARE HOONIES IN MY NEW HOUSE. Man: [ On TV ] ...IT DOES THIS TO CATCH THE SMALL FISH WHICH ARE ITS MAIN FOOD, OR SIMPLY TO EVADE ITS ENEMIES. THE LOON'S LEGS ARE SO FAR BACK ON ITS BODY THAT MOVEMENT ON LAND IS SLOW AND AWKWARD... [ *** ] Willy: [ Narrating ] RULE NUMBER ONE WHEN CHECKING TO SEE IF YOUR HOUSE REALLY HAS EVIL, VICIOUS, TWO-HEADED ALIENS IN IT: YOU HAVE TO BE SCIENTIFIC, AND YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE RIGHT EQUIPMENT. OKAY. [ *** ] Willy: [ Narrating ] RULE TWO... BE PREPARED FOR ANYTHING. [ *** ] [ Sigh ] [ *** ] [ Gasp ] [ *** ] [ Snap ] [ *** ] [ Rustling/snap ] [ Gasp ] [ *** ] [ *** ] I KNOW YOU'RE THERE. I KNOW YOU'RE THERE! [ Rustling ] [ *** ] [ Rustling ] [ *** ] [ Twigs cracking ] OKAY... I'M PUTTING THE RAKE DOWN. BUT NO FUNNY BUSINESS. [ Rustling ] LIKE I SAID, NO RAKE. ON THE COUNT OF THREE, OKAY? ONE... TWO... THREE. Both: [ Screaming ] [ Panting ] BUT YOU'RE... YOU'RE... BUT... BUT YOU'RE... GOOBY? UH... YOU GUESSED IT! I THOUGHT IT WOULD TAKE A LOT LONGER THAN THAT. NOT... NOT HOONIES? HOONIES? AAH! HOONIES? AIEE...! WHAT'S A HOONIE? Woman: I'M TELLING YOU, I SAW SOMETHING BACK THERE! Man: COYOTES LAST WEEK; BEARS THIS WEEK. Woman: IT WASN'T MY IMAGINATION! THOSE CRAZY PEOPLE NEXT DOOR! [ Grunting ] HIT THE DECK! Woman: VERNON! WOULD YOU JUST GO TAKE A LOOK! IT WAS BIG AND IT WAS FURRY, BUT IT WASN'T A BEAR! [ Grunting ] IT'S A GOOD THING I'VE COME TO SAVE YOU, WILLY. THESE NEW NEIGHBOURS OF YOURS ARE CRAZY. THEY THINK THEY SEE MONSTERS IN THEIR BACKYARD! BUT THERE ARE MONSTERS IN THEIR BACKYARD. YOU'RE RIGHT! WHAT IN THUNDER... [ Bell jingling ] WHAT DO YOU MEAN, YOU'VE COME TO SAVE ME? YOU ASKED FOR HELP, DIDN'T YOU? YOU MEAN YOU'RE IT? Woman: [ Yelling ] OH... VERNON! YOU'RE THE TOY I PLAYED WITH WHEN I WAS PRACTICALLY A BABY! SO, WHO BETTER THAN AN OLD FRIEND TO HELP OUT WHEN THE ROAD GETS ROCKY? Woman: VERNON! [ Sighs ] HAH... [ Grunts/groans ] [ Chuckles/sighs ] BUT... NONE OF THIS MAKES ANY SENSE. YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE A NORMAL TOY [ Laughing ] ABOUT THIS BIG. HEH-HEH, YEAH, BUT WHEN I'M LIKE THIS, WE CAN HAVE A LOT MORE FUN. EH? WHEN I'M AT THIS SIZE, I CAN TAKE CARE OF ANY TROUBLE THAT COMES ALONG, [ Dog barking ] SUCH AS... UH-H-UH! [ Barking ] MAYBE WE'D BETTER GET YOU INSIDE. COME ON. [ Whimper ] Man: [ On TV ] ...AROUND CENTRAL CITY. I DON'T LIKE THE IDEA OF SO MANY PEOPLE GATHERING TOGETHER HERE AT A DRIVE-IN. YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT MIGHT BE LURKING IN THE DARK. Woman: [ On TV ] DON'T BE RIDICULOUS! THERE'S NOTHING UNUSUAL, STRANGE, OR UNWANTED, LURKING. Man: [ On TV ] THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE WRONG, MAGGIE. [ Whispering ] GO! Man: [ On TV ] I BELIEVE THERE COULD STILL BE GIANT MONSTERS ON THE LOOSE. MONSTERS THAT COULD EAT A... WOW! [ Grunt ] THIS IS GREAT! GOOBY... THIS IS FANTASTIC! [ Panting ] LOOK AT ALL THIS STUFF! [ Laughing ] WOW! HEY! THAT'S MY SPACE CART! Mrs. Williams: WILLY? UH... [ Gasp ] WAIT! WAIT! GOOBY! GOOBY! GOOBY, COME ON, GO! OW! OW! ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? UH, FINE, MRS. WILLIAMS! OW! OW! JUST... UH, TALKING TO ALIENS. [ Muffled scream ] Mrs. Williams: YOUR MOTHER CALLED. SHE'LL BE HOME FOR DINNER. OKAY! OKAY. [ Panting ] WAH. UGH. WHOO! DEFINITELY, NEXT TIME WE DO THIS, WE NEED TO GET A BIGGER CLOSET OR A SMALLER ME. YOU'VE GOT ONE OF THOSE! Man: [ On TV ] ...MONSTERS THAT COULD EAT US ALL AND DESTROY THE ENTIRE CITY! OH-H-H, THIS IS GREAT. CAN I HAVE IT? PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE. YES. GOOBY... GOOBY! SOUNDS LIKE SNOT. SNOT? WHAT SOUNDS LIKE SNOT? MY NAME. YOU WERE YOUNG SO I CAN'T COMPLAIN, BUT I ALWAYS THOUGHT IT SOUNDED LIKE GREAT BIG GOBS OF SNOT. [ Excited squeal ] OOF! OH... MARKERS! WOW. I LO-O-OVE MARKERS! UH, GOOBY, I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD BE... I VERY MUCH THINK I SHOULD. WELL, UH... MARKERS ARE ABOUT THE BEST THING IN THE WORLD... NEXT, OF COURSE, TO THOSE... WINDOW COOKIES. THIS...

N-NO! NO! MY DAD WAS REALLY MAD ABOUT PUTTING THESE UP IN THERE. IN THE CLOSET? HE SOUNDS LIKE FUN. UM, HOW'S ABOUT... RIGHT THERE? IT'S BRILLIANT! Elise: WILLY! OH! MY MOM. BUT WE JUST DECIDED... UH, JUST FOR NOW. WAIT! WHOA... DON'T MOVE. OW! MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL, WHAT? DON'T MAKE A SINGLE SOUND. CAN'T I... [ Indistinct ] [ Sigh ] SO THAT WOULD GIVE US TWO WEEKS AT THE RESORT ON THE BAY, [ Clatter ] AND THEN WE COULD DRIVE UP THE COAST. WHAT? HONEY, I DON'T THINK I'M GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO IT RIGHT NOW. JACK, I BOOKED 10 DAYS OFF OF WORK. [ Thumping above ] REMEMBER ROLLIE COVERED ME ON THE BALTIMORE TRIP? NOW, POSSIBLY THE THIRD WEEK OF NEXT MONTH... [ Thumping ] WHAT THE HECK WAS THAT? UH... I THINK IT WAS MAYBE... [ Thump ] [ Bugle *** ] [ Coughing ] WHOA... DOWN THE... DOWN THE WRONG PIPE, BUDDY? YOU NEED SOME WATER? [ Cough ] I'M OKAY... [ Panting ] I'M OKAY. [ Explosion ] [ Spitting ] [ Gag ] ARE YOU GOING TO BE SICK? NO, NO. [ Explosion/car horn honking] YES! YES! WILLY WASN'T FEELING WELL LAST NIGHT, SO HE'S JUST UP IN HIS ROOM SLEEPING, ALL RIGHT? Mrs. Williams: NOT TO WORRY! HE'S NOT GOING TO SCHOOL? [ Sigh ] SO HE REALLY IS SICK? HE OUGHT TO BE. I FOUND TWO EMPTY BOXES OF COOKIES IN THE GARBAGE THIS MORNING. HE MUST HAVE EATEN, LIKE, 50 COOKIES LAST NIGHT. Man: [ On TV ] NOW, WHEN YOUR IRISH STEW IS COOKED, YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE TO POUR OFF THE COOKING LIQUID, THE GREASE, AND PRE-HEAT ANOTHER SAUCE POT. IT DOES SLIGHTLY THICKEN WITH A LITTLE ROUX IF YOU LIKE. NOW, IF YOU DON'T, YOU'VE GOT TO BE CAREFUL... Willy: [ Narrating ] OKAY, IT SOUNDS OBVIOUS, BUT YOU'VE GOT TO BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN TRYING TO HIDE A GIANT ORANGE MONSTER IN YOUR HOUSE. FIRST, AND MOST IMPORTANT, GIVE HIM A PLACE WHERE NO ONE EVER GOES. TA-DA! WHAT DO YOU THINK? OH-H... WILLY... IT'S... GREAT! YEAH? OH, YES! IT'S... FANTASTIC. [ Chuckle ] 100 PERCENT! WHA... WHAT'S THAT OVER THERE? HUH? BYE. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? W-WHAT AM I, THE CAT? I'M NOT STAYING HERE. WHY NOT? [ Scoff ] ONE: IT'S DARK; TWO: THERE'S NO LIGHT; THREE: IT'S DARK... YEAH, BUT... YOU HAVE A FLASHLIGHT HERE, AND... MY OLD LAMP, SO YOU CAN TURN ON A LIGHT. AND... SNOT? TOTALLY SNOT. Man: [ On TV ] PEEL THE CARROTS. NOW THE CARROTS ARE GOING TO GIVE YOU... SOME OF THE GREEN STOCK WITH THE ONION AND THE CARROT. BUT CUT THE CARROTS NICE AND LARGE SO YOU CAN USE AS LITTLE MEAT AS POSSIBLE. AND MAKE SURE THAT GRAVY IS JUST AS THIN, NICE AND THIN BROWN LIQUID AS POSSIBLE. SO THAT PEOPLE WILL FEEL THAT THEY'VE HAD A REAL MEAL BUT YOU HAVEN'T ACTUALLY... ARE YOU EVEN GOING TO BE ABLE TO STAND UP IN HERE? STANDING UP'S NOT IMPORTANT. UGH! WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS N.S.A.I. N.S.A.I.? NO SNOT ABOUT IT. [ Chuckle ] THE BEST PART ABOUT IT: WE'LL BE CLOSE TO EACH OTHER. Willy: WELL, YEAH, BUT... WHAT ABOUT YOU MAKING NOISE? I MEAN, MOM AND DAD'S ROOM IS... RIGHT OVER HERE. WELL... I'LL JUST MOVE THESE BOXES OVER. THEN I WON'T HAVE TO GO OVER THERE. OH... [ Straining ] [ Clattering ] SHHHHH! HEY! SHHHH! SORRY. OOOH... [ Chuckling ] HEY... THAT'S YOUR DAD.

DIDN'T YOU COME RIGHT OUT EVEN THOUGH YOU THOUGHT I WAS A HOONIE? DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT YOU SAID? "HI." BRILLIANT! YOU THINK YOU'RE NOT GOOD AT MAKING FRIENDS, THAT'S ALL. YEAH? YEAH.

[ Chuckle ] FROM THE BOOKS OF THE SAME NAME? "FLESHERTON FISH GOES TO MARKET"? "FLESHERTON FISH BEYOND THE SEA"? "FLESHERTON FISH AND AHAB MAKE FRIENDS"? I WROTE THOSE BOOKS. THOSE ARE MY BOOKS. HANDS UP, THOSE WHO HAVE READ THEM. HANDS UP THOSE WHO HAVE HEARD OF THEM. WELL, NOT EVERYONE CAN BE FAMOUS. ALL RIGHT. LET'S PROCEED WITH OUR FIRST LESSON. [ *** ] Mrs. Williams: WELL, IF MRS.

[ Yelling ] [ Crickets chirping ] [ Dog barking ] HEY, WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO SLEEP? IN MY OWN ROOM. OH, I DON'T THINK THIS IS A GOOD IDEA ANYMORE. NO ONE EVER COMES IN HERE. YOU HAVE IT ALL TO YOURSELF. LOOK, YOU HAVE YOUR OWN MARKERS AND DRAWING PADS, AND MARSHMALLOW COOKIES. AND HERE, ELECTRICITY, SO YOU CAN USE THIS. AND YOU CAN EVEN HAVE MY TV. [ Sigh ] WHAT? WHAT ABOUT THE HOONIES? MM.... I DON'T KNOW. I MEAN, SINCE YOU GOT HERE, WE HAVEN'T REALLY SEEN ANY, HAVE WE? HERE. ONE FOR YOU, ONE FOR ME. YOU KNOW, I ALWAYS WANTED SOMEONE TO TALK TO ON THESE. GOOB... YOU'VE GOT TO STAY HERE. AND I'VE GOT TO STAY IN MY OWN ROOM. REMEMBER WHAT I SAID ABOUT GROWN-UPS NOT UNDERSTANDING STUFF? Mrs. Williams: WILLY! [ Sigh ] I'VE GOT TO GO. GOOB... DO YOU THINK YOU CAN BE STRONG ABOUT THIS? I DON'T WANT TO BE STRONG. WELL, SURE YOU DO. I'M STRONG, SO... THAT MEANS YOU CAN BE STRONG. RIGHT? SEE YA. [ Door opens/closes ] [ *** ] [ *** ] Willy: [ Narrating ] IT WASN'T PERFECT, BUT I KNEW THAT IF MY PARENTS WEREN'T PAYING ATTENTION TO ME, THEY SURE WOULDN'T BE PAYING ATTENTION TO THE BACKYARD. [ Cookie tray creaking ] [ Lips smacking ] [ Sigh ] [ *** on TV ] HMM. HMM... HMM? HMM... Willy: [ Narrating ] SO, NOW I HAD GOOBY TAKEN CARE OF...

WILLY, IS THAT YOU? YEAH. I'VE BEEN THINKING. WHAT ABOUT? THE SPACE CART. IT'S LIKE, WELL... I WAS SCARED AT FIRST, but then I was okay. And at the end, IT FELT GREAT, BECAUSE I'D BEEN SCARED AT FIRST. I DON'T KNOW. I GUESS BEING SCARED IS JUST ABOUT NOT KNOWING STUFF. IS THAT WHEN THE HOONIES COME? YEAH. THAT'S WHEN THE HOONIES COME. You know, SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE, WE HAVEN'T SEEN ANY. Yeah, I've been thinking about that too. MAYBE I'M NOT SO SURE ABOUT THEM BEING REAL ANYMORE. G'NIGHT, WILLY. G'NIGHT, GOOB. [ *** ] Mr. Nerdlinger: IT SEEMS... ABSURD THAT WE HAVE TO TEACH YOUNG PEOPLE ABOUT... LEWIS CARROLL, AS IF HE'S SUCH A GREAT WRITER. OH SURE, HIS BOOK, HIS ONE BOOK BECAME SO, SO FAMOUS. "ALICE IN WONDERLAND". I'VE WRITTEN THREE BOOKS, AND DONE MY OWN ILLUSTRATIONS. LEWIS CARROLL DIDN'T DO HIS OWN ILLUSTRATIONS. THE MAN COULDN'T DRAW A STICK. IT'S JUST ABSURD.

WHO FED YOU PEZ EVERY DAY? WHO WASHED YOU IN ORANGE JUICE THE TIME YOU FELL IN THE TOILET? WHO... WHO TOOK YOU AND... YOU THOUGHT I WAS A BEAR? THE POINT IS THAT...

SEE, GOOBY HAD HEARD MY DAD ON THE PHONE TALKING ABOUT AN EMERGENCY AND JUST ASSUMED HE WAS TALKING ABOUT THE EMERGENCY AT SCHOOL. HOW WAS HE TO KNOW THAT MY DAD WAS REACTING TO SOMETHING TOTALLY DIFFERENT, AND HADN'T EVEN HEARD THE CALL FROM THE SCHOOL? THE FINAL RESULT: GOOBY WANDERING AROUND A PLACE WHERE GOOBY SHOULD NOT BE.

WHAT THE...? I WAS THE ONE THAT CALLED YOU. I USED WILLY'S CELLPHONE. I BROUGHT HIM HERE. WHAT... I'M GOOBY. THE CRANE OPERATOR SAID THAT HE SAW YOU... I HURT MYSELF. IT'S OKAY NOW. BUT H... HOW...? THIS IS YOUR SECRET ROOM, ISN'T IT? WHERE YOU CAME AS A LITTLE BOY. HOW CAN YOU KNOW THAT? MOST GROWN-UPS FORGET THINGS LIKE THAT. ACTUALLY, MOST GROWN-UPS FORGET ALL SORTS OF THINGS. Jack: THE THREE TREES BY THE RAILROAD TRACKS... MY DAD AND I WERE GOING TO BUILD A FORT. HE PROMISED ME WE'D DO IT TOGETHER. WE NEVER DID. HE WAS ALWAYS SO BUSY... WORKING. TRYING TO MAKE THINGS BETTER FOR US. A BOY DOESN'T NEED THINGS. A BOY NEEDS A DAD. WHAT HAVE I DONE? WHAT IS THIS? A PLAN. MADE BY A LITTLE BOY, A LONG... LONG, LONG TIME AGO.

DO YOU REALIZE THAT? OUR LITTLE BOY, WE LET HIM GO FOR... FOR... FOR THIS... FOR THIS HOUSE. FOR THESE THINGS. DO YOU REALIZE HOW CRAZY THAT SOUNDS? WE DON'T NEED ALL THESE THINGS. WE NEED TO... CHANGE. AND I NEED TO BE THE FIRST ONE TO CHANGE. AND I WILL. THERE'S SOMETHING I NEED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT. OKAY? LOOK... I NEED YOU TO PROMISE ME THAT YOU'RE GOING TO STAY CALM. WHY? WHAT HAPPENED? YOU SAID HE WAS FINE. HE IS FINE. BUT YOU'VE GOT TO PROMISE ME THAT YOU'RE GOING TO STAY CALM. WILLY? [ Hinges creaking ] Willy: MOM... THERE'S SOMEBODY I WANT YOU TO MEET. [ *** ] HI! Elise: OH MY GOD! ABSOLUTELY... ANY TIME, ROLLIE. ALL RIGHT. WELL, IT'S OFFICIAL, GUYS. ROLLIE'S COUSIN IS A FULL PARTNER, AND I AM ON SABBATICAL. I'VE GOT TO WARN YOU, THOUGH, IT WILL BE TIGHT FOR A LITTLE WHILE. Willy: DAD, GOOBY SAYS TO MAKE SURE TO GET PRESSURE- TREATED WOOD. YOU KNOW WHAT? HE'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. HEH. ARE YOU OKAY, HONEY?

GET GOOBY TO THE CAR RIGHT NOW. I'M TRYING TO GET THE PICTURE OF MY LIFE! I CAN'T GET MY PICTURE! JACK, I-I THINK THAT'S WILLY'S TEACHER. YOU'RE TAKING AWAY MY MOMENT! Willy: COME ON, LET'S GO! MAYBE WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT PUTTING WILLY IN PRIVATE SCHOOL NEXT YEAR. WHAT DO YOU SAY WE GO PAY FOR THE REST OF THAT WOOD, HUH? YEAH. WHAT ARE YOU PEOPLE DOING? MY PICTURE! EEH? YOU'RE K...

Man: WELL, SEE, THE BUDGET'S PRETTY TIGHT, BUT I WAS HOPING TO BUILD ONE OF THESE FOR THE NEW BABY. Gooby: WILLY! GOOB, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN? WILLY, DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT YOU SAID TO ME THE FIRST NIGHT IN THE SHED? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? YOU SAID, "YOU'RE STRONG... THAT MEANS I'M STRONG TOO". REMEMBER? DO YOU THINK YOU CAN BE STRONG? [ Mixed chatter ] Sales associate: THIS IS THE STANDARD SIZE RIGHT HERE. BUT THIS IS, LIKE... [ *** ] [ *** ] NO. NO. I WAS WRONG ABOUT THAT. BUT... WE NEED TO BE TOGETHER, GOOB. HEY... IT'S ALL RIGHT NOW. YOU HAVE TO STAY. YOU HAVE TO BE STRONG, WILLY. I DON'T WANT TO BE STRONG. [ Sobbing ] I LOVE YOU, GOOBY. [ Sniff ] I LOVE YOU TOO, WILLY. [ *** ] DON'T FORGET. I WON'T... I WON'T FORGET. HMM? [ *** ] [ *** ] EXCUSE ME. IS THIS YOURS? I THINK SOMEONE DROPPED HIM. BUT I DIDN'T DROP ANYTHING. WELL... WILL YOU DO ME A FAVOUR THEN? WILL YOU TAKE HIM? HE'S A REALLY GOOD FRIEND. HIS NAME IS GOOBY. I THINK HE NEEDS A NEW HOME. [ Giggling ] HE'S FUNNY. I LIKE HIM. THANKS. TAKE CARE OF HIM, OKAY? [ *** ] WILLY! WILLY! YOU GOT GOOBY? GOOBY WENT HOME, DAD. [ *** ] I LOVE YOU, WILLY. LET'S GO HOME. ALL RIGHT, GUYS, THIS FORT IS A FAMILY CONSTRUCTION JOB, SO WE NEED TO LEARN THE BASICS OF CONSTRUCTION... Willy: [ Narrating ] THE FINAL AND MOST IMPORTANT RULE OF HAVING A BIG, FUZZY ORANGE MONSTER: REALIZING WHAT YOU LEAVE BEHIND. WHAT I MEAN IS: GOOBY MAY HAVE GONE ON, BUT HE LEFT ME WITH ALL SORTS OF STUFF. LIKE HOW TO BUILD A SPACE CART, THE BEST WAY TO GO GROCERY SHOPPING, AND HOW TO DEFEAT THE HOONIES. AND... HOW TO BE A FRIEND. OH, AND HE GAVE ME SOMETHING ELSE AS WELL. HE GAVE ME BACK MY DAD. AND MAYBE BECAUSE OF THAT I REALIZED THAT WHEN IT COMES TO FAMILY, WHERE WE BELONG ISN'T A PLACE, IT'S WITH EACH OTHER.
