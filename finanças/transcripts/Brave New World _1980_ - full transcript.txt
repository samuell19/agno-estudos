Bottom level. Orange beam. Enjoy yourself. What's happening here? This is a group of semi-moron Epsilons that's going on Nature-Nausea reinforcement field trip- I can see that. I meant, what's taking you so long? -Right away, sir. Now, sir? -Central Hatcheries plant. Priority. I'm sorry sir, there's a circuit delay. -Next. The cathedral of our Ford, please. -Just a moment. If you don't mind. I don't think you understood. I said priority. I happen to be the assistant director of the Central Hatcheries Plant. -Yes sir, I'll circuit check. Really, these Gammas. They're hardly brighter than a Delta. Or even Epsilons. Oh no, I'm sure any Delta is much brighter than Epsilons. like those That's one of the wonderful things of being a Gamma. -We're not too stupid and we're not too bright. -To be a Gamma, is to be just right. Alright sir. Central Hatcheries. Red beam. First level. -The cathedral of our Ford, please. -The cathedral of our Ford. First level. Blue beam. Oh, the cathedral of our Ford? Then I suppose you're part of the Archford Syntho-Religion staff? -No, I'm trying to get hold of someone there. Actually, I'm with the Sens-u-Feelie Corp. -Oh, a Tele-Feelie writer? Not yet, I'm still working on my first Docu-Jingle short. It's on the perfection of conditioning- -Oh yes, very interesting. Well, I go this way. Miss Lysenko? -May I see you for a moment, please? Hello Tomakin. I have a little surprise for you. -Oh, What? Tell me! -It has something to do with taking you on very special Computo-holiday trip. -I don't know. Ringo Rohrbough wants to take me to the Sex-o-rama festival. And Anmar Bowie for a week to a Sens-u-world park. And Ronald Jaggard- -It's very special. It's to the Savage Reservation. -Oh, that's different. Everyone will be so envious! Are you sure about it? -It's just a formality. Just a question of my application being- Miss Lysenko, why is this section closed down? -Something that was supposed to go click-click went clack-clack. Naturally, I wouldn't know what. I'm just a Beta. -Of course. -I have to go now Tomakin. -Of course. Artificial sunset has been reset for 6:04, due to technical delays. Sir, your assistant Fordship? -Yes? Oh, Helmholtz Watson. About Tele-testing your Docu-short. -I know you're very busy. But I do need approval from your office. -I have to address some Alpha graduates in Syntho-Culture. And then a meeting on consumption norms and standards. Right after that, I think. -All for more means more for all. If it can be made, it can be used. And if it can be used, it can be made. History is bunk. Half the time equals double the yield. War is bad for business. -As select Alphas, conditioned to believe without knowing And to know without believing You have been chosen to view the surrogate revelations and synthetic mysteries upon which all perfect 'assemblific' believe is founded. Here before you are sacred Teletime-plex relics of the sanctified life, thought and Holy Works of our Ford. From whose divine inspiration came the ultimate perfection of the endless assembly line. Which has given us the ultimate, endless, perfect happiness of more things. For more wants in perfect balance, with more wants for more things. -And it's from our inspired creator of the model T, that we derive our blessed sign of the T. -Ford be praised. -Let us now repeat the catechism. Community. Identity. Stability. Ford bless you. I am Mustapha Mond, Assistant Controller to her Fordship Nixona Big, Western World Controller. I have been assigned to show you certain selected Histo-Bunk highlights from the past. -But everything is perfect now. And everything will always be perfect. What does it matter what things were like when it wasn't perfect? -Excellent point. But quite misguided. Exposing future Stability Monitors such as yourself to the imperfection of the past is part of the perfection of the present. Centuries ago in primitive times. Before the dawn of civilization. There were things that would be inconceivable to us today. Such things as poverty. Although there was land and food in abundance, some starved. Because unlike our perfect society. They were unable or unwilling to balance population to consumption. Sometimes too much of one or too little of the other, the result? Disease. And rather than eradicate the source of disease, as we have done. The superstitious primitives continued to rely upon an useless class of technicians called doctors. Violence. Which the ancients actually appeared to have enjoyed and reveled in. While we have been conditioned to want only what we have and to have only what we want And are, therefore, always happy. The uncivilized ancients were prey to destructive emotions. Such as ambition. Hate. And love. Which, of course, always led to violence. Which in turn led to more violence. And senility. While we remain at the prime age of 35 to maximize our level of useful consumption until painless death from chemo-stimulation between the ages of 80 and 90. The people of the past lacked the knowledge of how to stay young. Even though they apparently valued youth so highly that they indulged in superstitious self-mutilation. As Seminariums, who will one day take your places in Syntho-Culture Stability Centers. You must face these Histo-bunk facts. Unpleasant and even revolting, as they sometimes are. Eating the actual flesh of animals. And even filthy things from the ground. And sometimes, refusing to engage with more than one individual of the opposite sex. And even collecting into groups called families. A pervasively, immoral concept of pre-civilized times. Thoroughly disgusting examples of complete sexual perversion, as you can see. -Did the primitive females actually..? -Yes. Primitive females gave viviparous birth to young. -Like animals? -Yes, physiologically exactly like animals. I understand your reactions. Perhaps we should take a brief Soma-break. Naturally, none of that you've seen will be shown to Betas or Gammas. Much less to Deltas like these. But each of you is an Alpha. You weren't mass-produced in Computo-Clone Bokanovski-batches. And you are all supremely happy, supremely content. But then, that is truly the perfection of our civilization. Everyone is adjusted. Everyone has been conditioned to want to do the work he has to do. And thus, everyone is perfectly happy, perfectly content. Alphas like you, Betas, Gammas, Deltas like these or even Epsilons. Are you happy? -Happiness for all is happiness for each. Are you glad to be Deltas? -Deltas all have lots of fun, Deltas get to play and run. Very good. Do wish you'd been incubated as Alphas? -No, no! Excellent, that's all. Would you flash-in Denise's assistant director, please? -I think she's occupied, sir. -Never mind, I'll do it. Miss. Trotsky? There seems to be a production slowdown, there will have to be a Time and Motion inspection. Miss. Trotsky? -There you are. I couldn't find you! -That's right, I forgot! I was going to engage you in Leisure-Hour today. -Well, that's alright. I made do. Anyway, it was about something else. There was a Data-transmission for you from the controllers' office. -About my trip, no doubt. To the Savage Reservation, you know. -Yes, I think they're canceling it. -Canceled!? They couldn't! They wouldn't! Not when I've made plans to- Where is it? -In the file. (WITHHELD PENDING OFFICIAL OVERVIEW) There must be some mistake! I had everything planned. How would something like that look on my Computo-file? -You'd better take a Soma! -Yes, that's just the thing. -Here you are, sir. -I guess you won't be going on your vacation now. -We'll see about that. It so happens, I know someone quite important in the Controller's Office. Quite important in fact. Mustapha Mond, First assistant to her Fordship Nixona Big. We'll just see about that. You are viewing Helmholtz Watson's film: Planned Perfection. Each newly produced infant is given 6 full years of nightly Hypnopedic Sleep-lectures to reinforce class-acceptance conditioning. Later, in Central Conditioning Centers like this, each child receives daily Happiness Reinforcement drills. As well as prescribed courses in Erotic Play, Death Acceptance Training, Full Consumption Practice and Nature-Nausea games. Then, upon reaching Computo-lescence after 6 more years in a Final Conditioning School, each happy, healthy individual will go forth to take up his or her predestined place in the Greater Society. Dedicated to ensuring the continuing perfection of Community, Identity, Stability. Excellent! And very nicely packaged. -You liked it? The whole film I mean? -Oh, immensely! You caught the whole spirit of unchanging perfection and with admirable simplicity. I'm glad I had a chance to see it before it's Computo-erased and Electro-shredded. -Computo-erased? Electro-shredded? -Unfortunately, it does contain some dangerously heretical ideas. -I made every effort to keep ideas out of it. -Take the scene on Anti-Nature Conditioning. Charming scene of little children revolted by fresh flowers. The implication is that Nature-Nausea Conditioning is necessary to keep people from enjoying the countryside and thus, under-consuming. -But that's true! -Quite beside the point. -I just wanted to show why Nature-Nausea training is one of our most recent improvements- -You see? Recent implies past. Improvement implies progress. And if the present is perfect, then there can't be any progress. And even the word 'why'. Why. That's the most dangerous of all. It raises the whole question of purpose. No, I'm afraid it'll never do to let an ordinary audience watch anything quite as dangerous as your Docu-short. -But the test-audience watched it, they all liked it. -Quite meaningless. Since they've been conditioned to like anything that's shown them. -But, all my work. -Exactly the point! The thousands of feet of film consumed. Hours of work expended by technicians. And once it has been erased and shredded, it can be done all over again! Remember your Sleep-Talk. Don't delay, consume today, use it up and throw it away. I'll make a special effort to keep ideas out the next time. -Commendable! You know, I'm reaching the age of 50. But I still remember my own youth. And I'm sure I had just as many deviant ideas as you do. I even composed a scandalous read-out myself once. I think it was about the possible benefits of allowing mutational differentiations in randomly selected embryos. Interesting idea, but dangerous in the wrong hands. How old are you exactly Helmholtz? -25. -25, just think. By the time you reach my age you've been able to have accomplished this dozens of times! Good work. Just keep it up. Are you sure assistant Mond knows I'm waiting? -Sir, your case is being circuit-checked through Computo-files. -Why? -I suppose to get all the reports on you. -Reports? Oh, from my superior. -Who? -Alice B. Stein. Director of the Central Hatcheries. -I wouldn't know. You can go in now, sir. -Yes, there it is. Controller confirmation of restriction for Thomas Grahmbell. Subject: Overview discretion by the director of Stability Norms. -But there must be a mistake! Is that all it says? -Well look for yourself. -But I'm sure there's a mistake. You can check my Computo-record. I have exceeded consumption- and pleasure-norms on each of my Free Vacations. And so I'm eligible now for a free Free Vacation. This director of Stability Norms, who's that? -I am. -Oh! Well I'm sure you know about this- -Mistake? But I'm afraid it isn't, Thomas. You see, I'm the one who requested the official overview. -But why? I went through all the proper channels. -The Savage Reservation can be dangerous. Not in the physical sense, but in other ways. You see these primitives are not like the Quakerites who were driven into the Yukon. These primitives are quite different, they have actually regressed into an ancient form of tribal society. -Their ways are so directly opposite to ours that it can cause a very disturbing effect. As a matter of fact, several previous visitors had to be sent to an Emotional Re-engineering Institutes. -Naturally, we couldn't chance that happening to someone in your position. Naturally! But you visited the Savage Reservation, everyone knows that. -It certainly hasn't affected you in any way. Perhaps not. But then my Predestination Conditioning is to accept the unacceptable. While yours it to attain the attainable. Quite different. -But how can I attain the attainable without something unique like this on my Computo-file? -Yes! A valid point. I'll take it into consideration. -When? I'm planning on leaving tomorrow morning. So if I can get any immediate clearance- -Of course, you could go over my head to the Controllers' office. -But I wouldn't do that. -You wouldn't. -Well I wouldn't want to. -I see. But if you had to, you would. Maoina, put that permission-order through for him. -Thank you! -One thing, you shouldn't go to the Savage Reservation alone. Take a female along, preferably one with definite Anti-Deviant Morality Training. -I've already taken care of that. I've engaged several extra females over past few weeks, precisely to pick out the proper one. Linda Lysenko. One of the fertilization technicians at the plant. A well conditioned Beta minus and very pneumatic. Did you pick at all up Maoina? -Yes, everything is programmed into his Computo-file. -What's his read-out? -Plus 5 assertiveness quotient. -That's quite acceptable with his conditioning-level. I think he can continue to be considered for a upper-management post. Don't you? -Yes. But I can't help finding him just a little- -Pompous. -Yes. -Self-serving? -Yes. -You see? Solid managerial potential. -But he is so dull! -With Alphas conditioned for upper-level executive duties like Thomas, being dull is an absolute necessity. It vastly increases their ability to think rigidly and inflexibly. Here I am Assistant-Director. -What? -About the production-quota inspection-request from your office. -Oh, yes of course. -Here we've been able to speed up the stunning of Epsilons semi-morons. An extra half-batch a week! -Ah, well I hope they still be able to perform the necessary work. -Of course, speeding up the production of Gammas and Deltas without performance-loss is more difficult. But even sub-Deltas can still perform routine jobs. Sorting, filing, collecting results. Of course there's nothing to be done about Alpha and Beta-production. One egg, one bag. Unfortunately it still takes nine months. Even- Even Increase Surrogate Intricate Transfusion- - Yes, yes, yes. Pardon me, I really have to take care of something. An administrative detail. Oh, Tomakin it's you! Look what you made me do. -Everything's set for the trip to the Savage Reservation. Unless you're not interested now? -Oh, I am Tomakin! When? -We're catching the early rocket tomorrow morning. -Oh, the early rocket? -What's wrong? -Well, it's just that I'm engaging one of the Beta-plus from Decanting tonight. Adolf Rockefeller. You know, the cute one with the curly eyebrows. And we were gonna spend the night at his apartment. But we can spend the night at my place. It's much closer to the rocket-port. Unless you rather engage me tonight? I'm sure I could rearrange my plans. -Oh no, no I've already engaged you twice last week. And you know how people gossip. Suppose they start whispering that I've immorally limited my engagements to just one female. I've got my reputation to think of. I've never engaged him before. But all the girls in Decanting say he's very good and he's so cute with his curly eyebrows. -Have you seen the new Feelie? -Where this Alpha Erotic-Counselor becomes a Delta Pleasure-Technician by mistake- I'm not exactly sure what happens, but everyone says the Applied-Religious orgy-scene is wonderful. That's where Adolf's taking me. Who are you engaging tonight? -I'm not sure. Actually I'm not engaging anyone. -It's just like Thomas says, people gossip. They say you have only engaged one man in the last three weeks. -It's true. I don't know what's wrong with me. -Well you have to do something about it. -I have, really. I went to a Dispenser. But you know what they're like, take two Soma and go to bed. Synthetic Therapy sessions, VPS-treatments, even a pregnancy-substitute. But nothing seems to help. I just don't know what's wrong with me. Un-Computocepted female! You forgot to set your Computoception-dial on your Malthusian-belt. -I'm always doing that! Sometimes I wished I'd been incubated as a neutered free-martin. Just think, they can engage all their lives without having to fuss about Computoception. -Here, let me help. You don't want to get- pregnant. Did you do the drill yesterday? -I think so. I must have, I engaged one of Assistant Fertilization engineers on the Compulsive Leisure-Hour. You know, the tall one. -Then just set the dial to the next one. Remember, day + 1 = none. -Day + 1 = none. (Anthro-study Station.) I'm Stalina Shell. Chief Warden for the reservation. I understand you arrived yesterday and rested over. Proper climatization, that's the thing. I suppose you stayed at the Luxo-tel at the Rocket-port? -Yes, it was just as nice it could be! -We're quite proud of it. Liquid air, Vibro-Vacuum massage, Sens-u-Feelie Vision. But, of course, you won't find any of that on the Reservation. -Oh, you mean this isn't part of the Reservation? -Oh no, this is the official Anthro-Study Station. The Reservation is some distance, it's quite remote and completely sealed off by an electronic barrier. But you'll be taken directly to our Sub-Station by Escaporter. From there you'll have to go on foot. You'll have a guide. They're Delta-minuses, all specially incubated for high eye-ear-nose acuity. Unfortunately, at the expense of some other faculties... Well, first let's see if you're properly out-fitted. Ion-Heater. Sens-u-Therma bag. Extra Soma and Ampheta-Pep rations. Condensed Syntho-food. Ultra-Sonic Micro-Bomb Pop-Popper. You know how to fire this, of course. Safety off. Aim. Press firmly on the clip. Entirely non-lethal. It nearly causes temporarily paralysis. -The savages, if they are dangerous I certainly don't want to expose Miss Lysenko. -It's simply a precaution. Actually the savages are quite tame. If you're ready, I'll show you to the Escaporter. This way. It's so seldom anyone visits the Savage Reservation. I rarely have the opportunity to show off our treasures. -What is that? -Just some examples of our fauna. They have all been conditioned to remain in the Hunting Reserve beside the savages. -No, I meant this. -One of their cult superstitions, meant to frighten off demons. Their religion seems partly based on demonology. -What sort of demons? -Almost anything at all. Rocks, trees, animals. Sometimes strangers, like you. We must've come almost a mile by now. -Yes, um. One moment! How far is the Savage Reservation? No no, not where. How far? -There! -Look! Those things that they're putting in their mouths. What are they doing that for? -Stop it! -They're eating them. -How can they? They're just dirty things from the ground. They're not even wrapped in plastic! Don't they know any better? -Of course they don't. They're not civilized. Mamma! -Stop it, that's enough! -Why are they acting like that? Hitting, laughing, crying. It's weird. -It must be some aberrational pattern. I hear there once was a thing called 'madness' in primitive times. That must be what it is. Maybe we better get away from them. It might be catching. -Fascinating. I really should do a Psycho-Graph read-out. Perhaps on the degenerative effects of a un-Decantation. Yes, this is just the thing that'll look really good on my Computo-file. Well, move aside. I wanna go through. -No. It is forbidden to approach the crucified God, Nakatun. -I just want to snap some Computo-pics. -No. -Where's the Director? Who's in charge around here? -I am. -He's so old! -Linda! A Ford, a Ford! -Tomakin! -Here I am! -It was so disgusting, so horrible. There was this female, she was actually- - Listen to me. This could be a real coup for me. Sacred artifacts, and I'm told there is place not far from the village where there's possibly, just possibly there's a whole model T. -Where? -They call it the Demon's place. Of course if you rather stay behind I'll- -No! Any place is better than here. I don't care what he says. I can't go any further. -Better take an Ampheta-Pep. -What is it? -Mescal. A little is good. Much is not good. -How awful. -Well? What are you waiting for? Come on, move along! -Time for Soma-byes. -Yes, Tomakin. -Ready? -Just a second. Day + 1 = none. No, been two. No? One! Coming Tomakin. Oh, is that all you want? Just try to be a little quieter. -No. The evil one that becomes the spirit of wild animals. Satan. -Nonsense, just leave us alone. Get away! -No, the evil one. Satan! -Well, we'll just see about that! -Pop-pop them, Tomakin! -Oh, no. Linda! Linda? -After that, he seems to have wandered for several days before being found by a Search-Helirocket sent out by the Chief Warden, Stalina Shell. Apparently he suffered from deconditional hallucinations, something about demons and sacred relics according to the Chief Warden. -Yes, Spiritual Psychosis. Always a danger upon contact with viviparous primitives. I presume he was given a Soma-Decompression therapy? -Yes, he was completely cured. Subsequent tests showed he conformed to proper Socio-Psy norms. -Then he can still be Computo-granted to rise at least one more level before any disabling incompetence has to be seriously considered. The female companion, Linda Lysenko. No trace of her was found? -No trace. But of course, there's no practical reason for a search. -her body would've begun to decompose and be much too contaminated for Phophorus Chemocovery. Tomakin? Get away from me. I'm not one of you. I don't belong here. I may as well have died. Not that I mind dying I had very high marks in Death-Appreciation as a child. Get away! They're the ones. -It's all their fault. Which one? -Both of them. That is impossible! Which? Must the truth be torn from your tongue? -Both of them! Horrible savages. Get them away from me! I want Tomakin back. -Then it was the one from the Other Place. -Tomakin... -Since it was the other, you may stay. -Stay? Stay here!? What are you talking about!? Get me some Soma. Anything! Can't you see that there's something wrong with me? Probably caught one of your horrible, primitive diseases. Makes me feel like this every morning. And look! That is because of the child. Child? -Baby. -Baby? -Because you are pregnant. -Pregnant!? Male, yes? A male child? -I don't care. -You must choose a name for him. Now, while the evening star bares the fullness of moon. -I don't care. -Without a name, the goddess of life can't touch breath to his lips. One. -John, John, John! I don't care! Get out. Leave me alone. It isn't fair. Now no-one will ever want me. After the orgy-service, I've got tickets for the new Feelie. -Oh that's wonderful! I'll be ready right after work. -Wrong. Wrong. Alcohol addict to Alpha-plus bottle. Wrong. -Oh well. No no! It is a sacred wine. Nectar potion, only meant to anoint you with. -But I don't have any Soma. Cento-partuatary extract levels: satisfactory. Hyper-oxygenation levels: satisfactory. Final DNA genetic scan-level- An Alpha-plus bag of Bernard Marx. Of course, it should've been caught earlier in the production line. The Chief Quality Engineer seems to think some of the alcohol for sub-stunting Epsilons embryos has gotten into this Alpha-bag by mistake. But, of course, that's quite impossible with the zero-flow procedures I've instituted. Probably some clerical mix-up before the raw material reached my division. But I can ensure you, that I intend to institute more computer control. -Yes, I'm sure. Are there any other production-defects? -Oh, no no no. Just one random mistake. -A random error? Interesting. The name again? -Bernard Marx, an Alpha-plus, male. Shall I order the unit aborted? -No! Proceed with the assembly. Male, Alpha-plus. Marx, Bernard G. Inspected and approved. Case number 8. Raquel Gandhi, Beta-minus. Eradication and Rectification technician. Consistent failure to share an Orgy-Porgy devotional service. Recommendation: re-education center of subjects' choice. -Approved. -Case number 9. Bernard Marx, Alpha-plus, aged 6, Central Nurseries Plant. -Bernard Marx... So he's six years old now. -Continued socially erratic behavior patterns. Failure to conform to prescribed Intellectual Achievement Norms. -He hasn't been able to keep up intellectually with other Alpha children? Just the opposite. It seems he over-absorbed his studies in less than the time-frame allotment. A distinct pattern of deviant over-intelligence. -I see. And the recommendation in Bernard's case? Removal to a Recondition Nursery for infants and older children. -Denied. But I want to be kept informed on Bernard's progress. Because gray is the nicest- -How lucky to be a Delta- -...not too stupid and not too bright. -So glad to be a Beta. -How lucky to be an Alpha. Everyone is happy. Attention. Central Nurseries depot. Alpha-ward one. Electro-stall 9. Marx, Bernard G. Rectify. Sleep refreshes, sleep revives. Sleep is nice, sleep is good. Sleep is what everyone should. Mother? -No no no, I told you! Don't ever call me that awful name. I told you, John. Linda, Linda! -Can't you learn that? -Yes, Linda. What are chemicals? -How would I know? -It's your book, Linda. -Well that doesn't mean I know what chemicals are. -Where do chemicals come from? -From the chemical-supply depot, of course. Someone wants chemicals, the chemical-workers bring chemicals. Just like anything else. -Like anything? -Yes, anything. Not like this awful place. If you want Syntho-food, the workers bring Syntho-food. If you want plastic clothes, the workers bring plastic clothes. Whatever you want! -I wish I could go there, Linda. -I wish I could too. Everything is so perfect there. Everything's there you could want. And anything you want, you could have. Anything! And if you're ever blue-blue. Wonderful pills that never make you feel bad afterwards like mescal. And the people aren't evil and immoral. And in the other place, everyone engages with everyone as they should. And you could engage all the time with anyone you'd want. -Like Pele? Oh, no. I'd never bother engaging anyone like Pele in the Other Place. -Can't we go there, please? -You don't understand. It's too late. Hey, see what I got? Mescal! -Let me have some, Pele! Please? -Sure, the little one out first. -Run out and play, John. -I don't want to. -Come on, John. Little wolves have little fangs. I just don't know what to do with you, Bernard! Maybe the Chief Computer-Structure does. -Well, well, Bernard Marx again. Still refusing to participate in Religious Sex Devotion exercises? -No, this time he distracted the Erotic Training class by refusing to play Hunt the Zipper. -Well, well, Bernard. Don't you like to play Hunt the Zipper? -No. -I see, I see. Sit down, Bernard. No, no in the Vibro-water chair. Comfy? Now Bernard, do you want to play Hunt the Zipper? -No. -Are you sure? You really do want to play, don't you? -No. -Let me ask you again. Do you want to be allowed to go back to your Erotic Training class and play Hunt the Zipper? -Yes. -Fine, now run along back and play. Quick! Quick! He does seem to be bit of a problem. I think we better schedule him for clinical sessions with one of the school's Psycho-Sex therapists. -Whatever you say, of course. Personally, I think there's something wrong with him. He's so little for his age. Hardly bigger than a Gamma. You know they say some alcohol got into his pseudo-blood surrogate while he was still in the bag. -I've heard that too. Still, you must admit he's brilliant. -In Computo-reading and play-math, yes. But he completely failed his Sensitivity Training. I think he should be put into a Remedial Conditioning Class. -Yes, yes. Or even an Immoral Reformation Institute. However, the fact is that, for whatever reason, Mustapha Mond has taken a special interest in little Bernard. And if the First Assistant Controller is interested in him, then we are too. Aren't we Miss Arco? -Yes, we certainly are. How all occasions do inform against me, And spur my dull revenge. What is a man If his chief good and market of his time Be but to sleep and feed? A beast, no more. -Leave her alone! -You know what she is? -Yes I know. She is my mother. -But who is you're father? -Tomakin! Now leave! -I'm just trying to be good and do the right thing. Engaging one is bad. Having two is good, having three is best. Four, five, six is a perfect mix. Seven, eight, nine whenever there is time. Everyone who's civilized knows that. And now all I can have is Pele, because he's drunk and won't work. And no-one else wants him. -No, not him! -I know it's immoral to engage only Pele. What can I do when- -Oh most pernicious woman! Oh creature that dust in venom while she's with the vile- -Say something nice for Linda. From the old book that Mitsima gave you. About the pretty lady sleeping? Tell me that one again. Please? But now sleep, sleep and see what visions I have seen, of towers cloud capped, and men that like angels fly, thither shall we go, you and I. Alright sir. Central Hatcheries, red beam, first level. -Bernard Marx! -Oh, Helmholtz! Central Hatcheries, please. -Alright, sir. Miss Trotsky, Miss Meyer, Miss Rothschild? Didn't I order a Computer Rejection Feasibility Chart on increased production of Delta Pluses? -Yes, Director. -But it's not there. -No, Director. -Then where exactly is it? -It was supposed to be done by Bernard Marx. He's the new Assistant Computologist. -Oh yes, I know the one. A very spired moral record to say the least. Brilliant, I suppose. But only if Mustapha Mond didn't take a peculiar interest in him. But if he's fallen down an assignment... Thank you! Hello Bernard. Oh Henry, am I interrupting something important? -No Lenina, I'm doing a current inventory on Epsilon production. -I just wanted to make sure that it's tonight I'm engaging you. -Yes, I'm going to pick you up after work. You didn't forget, did you? -Oh no, I just wanted to make sure. I'll be ready. -Bye Bernard! -Lenina. -Bye. -Mr. Marx! I believe you were told to Comput-o-project the Production Feasibility Rates of increased Delta production. -Yes, Director. Then where, may I ask, is the report? -Here, sir. -Here? And not on my desk Comput-o-screen? When then it's late. -Unfortunately I had to revise some of the input from your office, but I think you'll find it all here now. End use allocation percentages of intensive maximization of assembly personnel units and a recommendation to rectify some of the declining production- -Yes yes yes, we shall see. We shall just see. Bernard! -Hello again! -I tried to get you this morning so we could come together. -Here? I thought you were working on a new Feelie? -I was, but the producer came with notion to produce a Docu-Jingle. -On the Central Hatcheries Plant? That's interesting. You must be very happy. -Yes, of course. Especially since they selected me over several others. -Hi, are engaging you anyone tonight? I'm free. -Actually, I'm tired of work. -Too bad, maybe next time. -Women... they can be such a distraction. -Really. How about engaging me tonight, Lenina? -I can't Benito, I'm engaging Henry Exxon. -How can she let herself be part- -Be careful. If someone heard you talking like that. Even as a joke. -You've complained sometimes, I heard you. -Yes, but not over something trivial like that. I have to go to a Jingle board conference. Stop by and see me sometime? She's not trivial. Hi again. -Hi. -I saw you with Lenina today. I thought you might be engaging her tonight. -Oh, Bernard and I never engaged each-other. Maybe Bernard doesn't think I'm pneumatic enough? -I think you're very pneumatic. -Don't forget about the vacation-trip, Lenina! -You're going on vacation with him? -Maybe. -I suppose you've decided which girl you're going to take on yours. -No. -Well, I just can't make up my mind either. Benito asked me, and Henry Exxon and Nikita Firestone. - I just don't know! I want to go somewhere different this time. Somewhere special. I guess I better be going. Henry will be waiting for me. -I expected young Marx would be wanting to something out of the ordinary. I see no reason not to grant his request. But you don't agree. -Well, I know Bernard Marx is a special project of yours. but no-one has been allowed to visit the Savage Reservation since Thomas Grahmbell. -All the more reason. We can see how he reacts to Bernard's going. Of course, it is young Marx I'm interested in. As you say, a special project. If a random variant, like Bernard, proves to be socially adaptable it might mean that certain mutations would be useful. -'Course, he could be Psycho-Emotively disordered by exposure to the freedom of the reservation. -Yes, and then he would be quite useless for further testing. Perhaps if a normative factor is controlled in, a female. Has he requested permission to bring one along? -I believe so. Yes, a Beta-technician in the Central Hatcheries Plant Lenina Disney. - Bernard Marx!? You're actually going on your vacation-trip with little Bernard Marx? -Yes! -But why? Nobody goes anywhere with him. -I know, but this is something different, special. Bernard has permission to go to the Savage Reservation almost no-one except the Director has ever been there! Besides, I like Bernard. Of course I've never engaged him, but there's something about him that's so.. cuddly Bernard, it's all set. I've arranged my Comput-o-leaves so I can go to the Savage Reservation with you. -That's wonderful! Of course we should engage once before we go. Otherwise people would start talking. Maybe even tomorrow night, if I shift around- -Could we go somewhere private to discuss this? -Whatever for? Besides, I don't have time right now. -Come on Lenina, we're going to be late for the Sens-u-Feelie. -Just a second! Tomorrow night, I'm sure I can fit you in. -Going off on vacation with Lenina! Don't worry, you'll enjoy engaging her I always do. -I don't care and I don't want to hear about it. You seem upset about something. Maybe you've been working to hard. Remember. Work to play and play to work. A little Soma, that'll fix you up. Remember, a Soma a day- -I don't need any Soma! And I don't want any Soma. -How about Ampheta-pep? -No! Maybe a violence-passion surrogate treatment? Sometimes that does wonders. -Maybe you're right. Just step into the Psycho-porter, sir. Let's make sure you're comfy and secure in there. We have electrode contact! All in order. What would your preference be? An inquisition torture chamber? A pirate raid? Perhaps you'd like to try our new "Gangster rub out" treatments. A novelty, but we've had excellent results with them. -What's your strongest treatment? The gladiator circus, number 4. But I would not recommend that for you, sir. It could be quite demanding, physically. Only Betas and Alphas are- -I am an Alpha! Can't you see what I'm wearing!? -Yes! I just thought there was a slight confusion. -I don't think so. Number 4, thank you. -Yes, sir. Whatever you wish. Why did you stop the treatment, sir? Were you displeased? Would you like to try a different one? -No, thank you. I'm just There are some things I have to think about... consider. -Think? Consider? How awful it must be to be an Alpha. -And how lucky we are to be Gamma! After all -To be good is Gamma, because Gamma is good. The girl I was telling you about, Lenina. I think about her all the time. And what's worse, now that I'm taking her on vacation I feel even more wanting about her. -Where are you going to? The new Lux-o-camps? -No, Savage Reservation. -Really? How did you manage that? Maybe something like that is what I need. You know how distracting everything can be too many awards, too many girls too much of everything. Sometimes, I wish I was young again and starting out like you. -Helmholtz, you're successful, you're talented. -Yes, everyone says I've written some of the finest contemporary Jingles. Still, lately I have the strange feeling that there must something more I can write about. Something different! -Really? Like what? -Well, like the Sens-u-emotions in the Sens-u-Feelies and VPS-cubicals? Suppose that people can really feel those things love, hate, passion- -Now look here, Helmholtz. Suppose someone hear you talk like that. Both of us could be send to reconditioning centers or even one of those free islands, like Iceland or Madagascar. And you what that means, no Soma, no Ampheta-pep no thank you. -You're right, we shouldn't be talking like this. I shouldn't even let myself think about such things. I wish my problems were simple, like yours. -Simple? -Of course! If you want this Lenina, just tell her. What could be any simpler? -Don't be alarmed, sir. It's just the Solidarity patrol. Are you all right, sir? Can we help you in some way? -I'm perfectly alright. -But you're alone aren't you? There must be something wrong if you're alone. -No, I'm not alone. I'm coming to see someone, there. In that compartment. A female Beta. -That's different. Go right on, sir. Bernard! What a coincidence! I was just talking about you while Henry Exxon was engaging me. Don't just stand out there, come in! -Not here. -Isn't it awfully late for us to go engage anywhere else? -That isn't what I mean. I want you to come with me. -Now? -Yeah, now. There's no-one here! It's empty! -I know, that's why I come here. -By yourself? But Bernard, it's unnatural. -I know it. Sometimes I just don't understand you at all, Bernard. Sometimes I don't understand myself either. -I don't like it here Bernard. It's so silent and empty. There isn't even any Muzak. Why ever did you bring me here? Why don't we go somewhere, so we won't be so alone. -I want to be alone. With you. So that we can talk. Talk? -Whatever would we talk about? Especially alone? No-one really wants to be alone. -I do. I want to be alone. And I really don't know why. Except sometimes it makes me feel... more special. Different. Like I feel about you know. I don't want anyone else, I want you. Just you. -We shouldn't have left my place. I guess we could go to yours. -You don't understand, I want you. Just you, or no-one. -But everyone has everyone, so no-one has no-one! -Yes, I know. And everyone has everything, so no-one wants anything. -That's right! You feel better now, don't you? -A little. What are you doing here, Marx? -You send for me, sir. -Oh, yes. In a minute then. Miss Rothschild, would you come to my office for a moment please? Why have I send for him? -He's going off on his vacation, you have to sign his Computo-leave. -Oh, yes. Then why is his file not punched up? -It is. -Even worse than I suspected. His work record is definitely aberrational. He's actually been doing twice his scheduled work in barely half the time. That sort of thing can lead to complete breakdown of the system-analysis automation. When does he leave for his vacation? -Tomorrow. -Perhaps while he's gone, I can do something about him. Well I suppose I'll have to see him. Send him in. -Send in Mr. Marx, please. -Tonight, Rochina? -I can't tonight, I'm engaging Helmholtz Watson. -Oh yes, the Tele-Feelie Jingle writer. Well check for me with Miss Trotsky and Miss Meyer. Perhaps one of them is free. Bernard Marx, your performance has not been completely satisfactory. -I only hope sincerely hope that your time in vacation will allow you to seriously reflect. Do you follow me? -Yes, sir. -Good. Well, where is it you're planning to go? -To the Savage Reservation. -That's impossible. -Even in the past only the most rigorously selected individuals were allowed to go there. As a matter of fact, I once went there myself. -Yes sir, I know that. -I can assure you it would much to dangerous for someone like you. Only stamina and skill allowed me to survive it and the female I took along, I don't recall her name, she was exceptionally pneumatic. In any case she didn't survive it. So you see, it would be quite impossible for you to be allowed to go there. -But I've already been granted permission to go. -Obviously a mistake of some sort. -Not really. As you'll notice, it is official, signed by His Fordship. -Well yes, I see. -If you would sign it too, sir. -There. I hope you... enjoy yourself. -Thank you Director. -Vitina is busy too- -Not now, not now. Insipid, pushy little... With something like that on his Computo-file, he'll probably think he'll be advanced to an administrative position Well, we'll just see about that. -You mean him? -Yes, Marx. Bet he's got the ridiculous idea he could be Computo-upped to my position one day. We'll just see about that. And then Thomas called the whole staff together. Everyone. Even the Gamma clerks. And he announced that he'll be officially removed of all duties, because of gross moral and professional dereliction. -Bernard Marx? -Yes. I just love your feeling in bed, it so- -pneumatic. Go on, I mean about Bernard. -Well then Thomas said he was going to officially transferred to one of the sub-stations. On a free island. Iceland, I think. As soon he's back from- What are you doing? -I'm just checking the time. -But it's too early and I don't have to be in office until- Where are you going? -I have to make a Tele-call. -Now? -Bernard? Are you done with your Tele-call? Bernard! Iceland. - What? -Iceland. -Ah, Bernard. You don't want to go there, they say it's awful. -Transferred. It's not fair. Just because I got permission to come here? He's afraid how it will look on my file. That's it. What do I do? -Just take an extra few grams of sSoma. It'll be alright. Wasn't will make me ill, I take a gramme and only am! -No, he'll probably think I'll run right back. Then it won't be on my Computo-file. -Well, well, here you are. I'm the Chief Warden, Stalina Shell. I suppose you stayed over at the Rocket-port Lux-hotel? Climatization, that's the thing. I see they haven't outfitted you yet. We'll take care of that and show you about. -No, thank you, we want to go straight there. -To the Savage Reservation? But you should be out-fitted first. Ultra-sonic micro-bomb pop-popper, extra rations of Soma and Ampheta-pep. -Thank you, I don't need anything. If we could go straight to the reservation, please. -Then, I can't give you a guided tour of our station... whatever you wish. This way. It was almost like a Feelie. Wasn't it? -Can I have a Soma? -But I used all of mine. You should have taken the ones the Warden offered you. -If only there where someone here other than these savages. -There! -No, that's a savage. -Oh, but he's different than the others. He's so beautiful. Good morrow, strangers. I pray to be of any service to you? - Oh, well, thank you. -You come from the Other Place, do you not? -Who are you? -You see before you a man of besmirched honour and heart-pierced shame. Look, there. Oh, damned spot. -A gramme is better than a damn. -Oh, if I could have suffered the slings and arrows to rent my too, too sullied flesh like the others. -But you're not like the others. Your skin is so smooth -and your hair is so fair. -Yes, because of my skin. It should be my blood! Like the multitudinous seas incarnadine, there for all to see. -What are you talking about? -There, there! I should've been the one chosen. I could have withstood the whips. I could have appeased the very bolts of heaven and stood in proudest reignment before the crucified son of Nakatun. But no, they denied that to me. Oh, unfortunate fool. -What a shame. If only I had some Soma to share with you, you'd feel better right away. A Soma a day keeps the jim-jams away. -Sometimes Linda used to say that. -Oh, is she like me? -No, not like you. -Do you like me? Maybe you'd feel better if we went- -Who's Linda? -What? -Who is Linda? -Oh, my mother. -She came here long ago from the Other Place, but she was lost and separated from Tomakin. My father. -Is Tomakin your? -My father. -Was he from the Other Place also? When did he come here? What did he look like? -Well, I'm afraid I couldn't tell you, but Linda could. Do wish to speak to her? -Yes, right away. Linda! -What is it? -Someone to see you! -Pelè? -No. She'll be right out. They're civilized! Are you from the real world? Ford be praised. At last! At last! Someone to come who can understand You're a Beta, aren't you? Just like me! I'd love to wear something nice like that again. If you only how it's been like for me, no Soma and no Feelies, and no Gamma's and Delta's and Epsilons to do the dreadful work. Really, worst of all, they won't let you engage with someone anytime you want. -He said his, the one you came with, Tomakin? -No, I just called him that. He was very important, Assistant Director of the Central Hatcheries. But I've forgotten his real name. -Thomas Grahmbell? -Yes! I suppose he's forgotten all about me by now. -Don't be so sure. How would you and your- How would you both like to come back there with me? -You mean to the Other Place? You'll take us there? -Don't you want to go? -Oh yes, yes! Thank you! Linda has told me how perfect it is. I've dreamed of it. But now to actually go there! Being able to leave this place! Be like Miranda and find a new wondrous world. -Who? -Oh what wonders! How many goodly creatures there be? How beauteous mankind is! How lovely and fair... Are you married to her? -Am I what!? -Married. Thus joined let two souls be as one. You understand, forever. here the word they speak mean that, forever. -I wouldn't know. Oh brave new world, and such people in it. The Computo-records verified her, her name is Linda Lysenko. A Beta-minus fertilization technician. And, apparently, there is no doubt that the young savage called John was- Well, that is to say, she's actually- -His mother? -Yes! And it was Computo-facted and verified that while in the Savage Reservation she actually gave viviparous birth, and it's quite clear that... -The father -Male impregnator could not have been a primitive. Is that all? -It's a dreadfully scandalous thing to come to light. -Of course, but interesting none the less. Especially the young savage. Viviparous birth and a unconditioned environment, the perfect experimental subject. -After Marx removed them from the Savage Reservaton, he took them to the local Luntz hotel He has made a number of Tele-calls seeking permission to bring them back here. -Of course, it was denied. -Of course, such permission could only come from Your Fordship himself, naturally. -Naturally. Have the next call from Marx transferred here. -Directly to Your Fordship's office? -Directly to me. And only to me. What's wrong with her? -She's fine, she's just Soma-tripping. Now, before I go let me acquaint you with some of our modern conveniences. -Bernard! Don't be afraid! It's just a vibro-vacuum massager. Watch. You see? Maybe you'd like to try our electro-healing couch? -Maybe later. Oh, well alright, if you're not interested in this, maybe you're feeling hungry. Here we have our micro-mini snack-bar. You just pick whatever item you like, push one of the artificial flavour buttons, how about minced burger and some imitation chips? Go ahead, anything you like. Bernard, I'm afraid I'm not very hungry. -It's alright. You see? Perhaps there's something worthwhile on the Tele-Feelie. The following Tele-Feelie program schedule is now available: Channel 1: The Guiding Neon. Channel 2: The Fordian Tabernacle Sing-a-long hour. Channel 3: General Dispensary. Channel 4: High Holy Orgy day services. Channel 5... I'm afraid there's nothing much on right now except, detergent serials and Syntho-Religious programs. Maybe you'd prefer the view. Something different, uh a seascape. Or whatever you feel like! Oh, what wonders! Is all this in the Other Place too, Bernard? -Oh, more than this John, lots more! John, you can have anything you want. -Then why weren't you happy there, Bernard? I don't know, uh, sometimes I felt like I didn't exactly belong, like, I didn't quite fit in with everybody else, but you wouldn't understand about that, John. -Oh, but I do, Bernard! I do understand! That's the way I always felt in Malpais, because I wasn't like everyone else. Well it's going to be different now, for both of us. Just wait 'till we get back there and they find out about you, you'll see. -When do we go Bernard? Soon? Now? Well first I have to get permission, that's why I'm going now to make a Tele-call. While I'm gone, I want you stay right here, I don't want you to go anywhere. Do you understand, John? -Oh yes, Bernard! You'll be allright, you're not afraid? Afraid? No. -I mean, to be here all alone? -Alone? Did the girl go away? -Lenina? No. She's upstairs soma-napping. John, don't worry. What heavenly perfection rests upon her hands, her eyes, her hair, her cheeks. Oh, but to steal an immortal blessing, from the lips of my Juliette. And of course, the moment I discovered the actual background of the savage, sort to speak, I realized this could be of considerable scientific importance, naturally- -Yes, yes Mr. Marx, I understand the situation. Permission will be granted for you to bring the savage and the woman back here. And I will expect you to give me a full report on the savage's activities and reactions. -Yes, Your Fordship, you can count on me to do everything necessary to see that full advantage is taken of the savage. For science, of course. -Yes, of course. Thank you, Mr. Marx.
