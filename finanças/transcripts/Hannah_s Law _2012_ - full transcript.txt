Hanna? Gone again? I declare, that girl takes special pride in making herself scarce when there's chores to be done. I'll help you clear the table, Kate. No, that's her job. How's she ever gonna learn responsibility? Caleb, round up your sister. Hanny! Hanny! He's never gonna find her. She sure enough knows how to hide. She gets that from your side, James. Where are you? Hanny, you're gonna get in big trouble. Where are you hiding? Riders coming in. Yeah. Get the kids in the house. Caleb! Hannah! Come back here right now. Get in there with them. What about Hannah? Get in there. Whoa. Evening. You guys are in a powerful hurry? Nice place. Name's beaumont. My name's frank mcmurphy. These are my men. Yeah, that's right, you heard of me. We need water, fresh horses. Well we got plenty water, but... The horses ain't for sale. Well... Nobody said anything about buying, sodbuster. We take what we need. James. Turk, pineda, round up them horses. Hacker, get that boy. - Come on. - Fellas, help him. Come here boy. Burn the house down. Let's go. Move your ass! We haven't got all day! Got you now. Come out. Where the hell are you? Let him go. I'm not a judge, or a jury. My job is to bring you in, see justice done. Don't! I need you alive, turk. Argh! What part of alive didn't you understand? Quit your whining. I didn't do nothing wrong. Morning ladies. Get your hands off me. The lady said stop bothering her. I warned you. You know... Whoa there. Whoa whoa. Hey Hannah. Wyatt earp. Busy morning? The usual. What do you got for me today? Turk Anderson. $200, same bounty dead or alive. Alive, as usual. Wouldn't expect anything else. Thanks. Come on over to my office. Come on tough guy, let's go. Come on, come on. Don't bother getting up. Wasn't going to. Beaumont, this your prisoner? - He's mine. - Mine's outside. Who's watching him, his maker? You know that's not how I work. I know. Hannah beaumont always brings them in alive. You know one of these days, one of these range bums isn't gonna give you a choice. What are you gonna do then? Put him in the ground. When we gonna get some help around here, Larry? We're doing fine. You mean I am. 200. Thanks Wyatt. Marshall. Hannah, wait up. Something wrong? Yeah, um, no, I mean no. Well deger broke out my pay for the month, and that's just about enough for one steak dinner at del Monaco's. I'd be honored if you shared it with me. Tempting, but I've been on the trail for two weeks. I'm exhausted. Right. Hey, another night, alright? Yeah. Yeah, you just let me know when. Right, I better get back before old deger hits one of the prisoners. Morning. I'm Hannah. Who are you? I know. Don't seem like it, but it will pass. Miss beaumont? Morning Mattie. Miss beaumont. You've met Elizabeth. She just joined us today. Go play with the other girls, dear. Elizabeth Johnson, she lost her whole family in an Indian raid. Army scouts found her two days later. She'll get over it. Here. You keep us going. Just keep up the good work, Mattie. And keep my name out of it. Of course. God must have truly sent you to us. God had nothing to do with it. See ya, Elizabeth. Whoa! Hey Hannah. Hey Mary. Whooee, got about a hundred miles of trail dust in my craw. One drink? - I'll watch ya. - Come on in. Set me up, Andy. What's in the box? Present. Who gave it to you? No, giving it. To you. I don't-i didn't ask for anything. I know. Open it. Ha ha. It's the same one we saw in that Marshall field catalog from Chicago. Thank you, but I don't have any call for an outfit like this. Well, you might. Someone asks you out to dinner. He already asked you. Damn, that boy is impatient. I told him to wait till I got back in town. You knew? He asked me for some advice. And what did you tell him? I told him, nobody in this town knows Hannah beaumont better than me. And I know it all. When y'all going out? I said no. What? You crazy. That Wyatt earp is a fine man, the finest thing to come through this hell hole in I don't know how long. - I know. - Then what? You're right, he's a great guy, good looking, honest, he loves the law. I just don't have room. No, it ain't healthy, you spending every night alone like that. You don't have anyone. Don't worry about that. Your religious schooling? No, convent is a distant memory. Besides, I do have someone special in my life. What's his name? Greena. My double barrel greena lover is always by my side. Mwah! Ya damn cheat! I'm sorry, where I come from winning is not always an indication of cheating. What are you calling me? Well, nothing yet. Trying to formulate, that is, put together a sentence, with words you might understand. Smart lunger. Your hardware don't impress me. My. Yeah. Well then fill your hand. Now, Walter, this is ridiculous. I have no interest in winning a game that's had a shadow cast upon it. You don't trust me, most assuredly, I don't trust you. What are we gonna do about it? We'll cut for it. - Cut? - Yeah. High card takes the pot. Just the three of us, yourself, myself, and lady luck. No chance of cheating by either party. No funny business. What you got? It's your lucky day, Walter, it's all yours. Wonderful playing with you. Ain't that a Daisy? Aw, you don't worry. You don't worry about doc, Hannah, he don't need your help. What about Wyatt? He's a good man. Besides, you need to go out with him. And why's that? Because I bought that dress. I'll pay you back. You know how you can pay me back? By going out to dinner with him. Ok. If it's that important to you. It is. Thank you. You have a good night, Hannah. Miss beaumont. Doc, you're gonna get yourself killed one of these days. When? When? Six to go. Some fellas just don't know what's good for them. What are you staring at?! Quit your lollygagging! Bring me those irons so I can change these brands! Get 'em in, get 'em in. Shoulda been outta here and hour ago. Here comes hacker. Must be feeding time. Fresh. He's been shot. Yeah, I just shot him. No, not him, turk. Where? In the arm, I think. I meant, where did this take place? Dodge. Is he dead? - Jail. - Too bad. Who did it? Some bounty hunter, but that's not the point. What is the point? It's the same bounty hunter who got ike Jefferson two months ago in haze, and chino before that in Blackwell, Oklahoma. I'd like to meet this man. It it ain't no man. Hey Wyatt. Good morning, Hannah. How's my prisoner doing? Hasn't stopped complaining. Are those new? Yeah, I was just about to bring you your copies. Three new handbills came in on the train, no one special. Listen, if I was too forward the other night... No, you were a complete gentleman. I was just tired. Is that offer still good? Tomorrow night ok? Come for you at 7:00. Great. That first one is Billy Lane. Henry Underwood was riding with Sam bass' gang until the rangers chased him all the way across north Texas. What is it? Isom dart? Wanted for murder in Wyoming, yeah. Got a wire on him, he's supposed to be in this territory. Do you know him? No, just another wanted man. Not for long if you're after him. I'll see you tomorrow at 7:00. 7:00. I love this town, Lauren. Even at night. Especially at night. Working man goes to sleep, this town still thrives, I love that. Where are my cattle? Half the contracted amount are in the stockyards now. Mcmurphy's wire said a week for the balance. Well you wire him back, and you tell him the rest of my cattle ain't in my yard, it'll be mcmurphy going to market. Yes sir. Whoa. Stitch. Frank. What's so all powerful important? Still hunting bounty? Yeah, it's a good way to stay in touch with old friends. Hear you're a legitimate business man now. Cattle hunt. Yeah. West needs beef. Anyone's beef? Nobody cares once it's on their plate. So why'd you send for me? Bounty hunter's name. Beaumont, Hannah beaumont. I heard of her. Well she's heard of us, she put away three of the old gang in the last six months. Damn. What have you heard about her? Works out of dodge city, Kansas. Works alone. That's all? No, she was raised by an old black bounty hunter name isom dart. Good news is, he's run afoul of the law, and he's got a bounty on his own head. Well, how the hell is that good news for me? Well, what do you do when cockroaches get in the woodwork? Smoke them out. Dart's in trouble, he'll most likely be headed for the beaumont woman. If I ride into dodge looking to collect the bounty on her old friend, that'll smoke her out. Well, we'll just see how good she is. Don't laugh. Damn, you look good. Don't get used to it. This is extremely uncomfortable. You alright? My shoulders are cold. You want my coat? No, I'll be fine. What were you saying? Just Marshall deger ain't gonna live forever. Not the way he eats. Yeah. Someday, and maybe someday soon, I'm gonna be the Marshall of this town. That pay's $80 a month being that Marshall, alright, I know that doesn't sound like a lot, but I got it all figured out, so. So, so I'm gonna save up enough money, get me a private train, yeah, yeah, I'll ride it right across the country, stopping in all the big cities, every big city with a circus, and I'll buy up every elephant they have, and I'll put them on special made elephant freight cars, and fill the coal tender right up with peanuts. What do you think about that, Hannah? That's nice. Wait, what? You weren't listening to me. I'm sorry, I'm just thinking about some things. I can tell. Maybe it would help if you talked about it. Talking won't solve this kind of problem. Hannah, you gotta know there's a lot of questions I'd like to ask you, but I don't. I appreciate that. Part of me thinks the answers wouldn't be enough. I have a feeling it'd be like looking into a well. You know, you think you've reached the bottom, but there's always more, more than you can see. Well, don't lose hope. Keep looking. My lord. Wyatt? Stitch. You know him? Zechariah stitch, ma'am. We hunted buffalo with bill and ed Masterson, a few years back. Now I'm off to bigger game now. This unfortunate fellow was wanted. Sure is. Was. Saw a handbill on him about a week ago. What's wrong little lady, you've never seen a dead man before? This is no lady, stitch. I mean, she has seen a dead body. This is Hannah, Hannah beaumont. I heard of you. You are the lady bounty hunter that always brings them in alive. Well I heard of you, stitch. You prefer to bring them in dead, isn't that right? Well, you don't have to feed them, you don't have to give them water, all you have to do is sling them over your saddle and ride them in. Stitch, I'm the law here now, you can't go heeled in this part of town. - Even for old friends? - I can't play favorites. Now, I don't need any trouble from you. I don't intend to cause any. I'll keep this smoke wagon sheathed. As for you, I heard you're pretty good, and I don't mean to ride herd over that type of bragging. But listen up, little lady bounty hunter, while I'm in dodge, I don't intend for you or anybody else get in the way between any hombre I've set my sights on. That's enough, ok? Who are you after? I'm here to put a bullet in a murderer, name isom dart. You don't care if it's in the front or the back. Hannah, wait up. Hannah! You know I can't abide killing, even a wanted man. Hannah, I know, but I just gotta say, looking at the collection of drovers and renegades you've brought in alive, well, most of them look like they might have needed some killing. Justice ain't mine to give. Here I am telling you. I notice you only draw that pistol to give polecats a knock on the head. Well, bullets ain't cheap. Especially when you're saving up to buy elephants. You have any idea how much peanuts will cost, alone? What are you gonna do? First light I'm gonna go after this isom dart character, and bring him in, alive. Dressed for the ball? It is nearly midnight. Jack of clubs on the queen of diamonds. Well thank you, darlin'. Good morning. Morning. Getting an early start? Allow me. Listen, doc... There's no need to say it. As a man who has lived a life of regrets, I know that look. It's just, I'm going off to do a distasteful thing. Another distasteful thing? There's nothing you have to say, and there's nothing I have to say about anything. Alright? Thanks. Now... As you may have discerned, I'm also an expert in the area of distasteful things. Is there no place for me in this game of yours today? Perhaps you could deal me in. No seat at this table. This, us. This was just a hand. Hannah. What are you doing here? I'm thinking I should be asking you that. I'm waiting on you. Waiting on you to come out your room. Mary, please, not today, not now. Nice dress. Hannah, I'm your friend. I know you are. Friends are allowed to tell each other when they've done something incredibly stupid. I didn't do anything, that's anyone else's business. Hannah. I said it wasn't anyone else's business. What about Wyatt? Especially not his business. Well I ain't gonna preach. Thanks. But I got to tell you, to do something like this, when you just starting out something good with Wyatt. Don't you think I want those things? Someone to love, family. Maybe I don't deserve them, you ever thought of that? Maybe you don't think you do. I know I don't. Sermon over? Yeah. What are you all dressed for? You going somewhere? Riding into the hills with ya. I don't want you riding out there. I owe ya. For what? Saving my life. When? When I moved here. You became my friend. Folks in this town didn't even want to look at me. I don't think I would have made it this long without you. And I don't take friendship lightly. Thank you, but I have to do this alone. Right. I thought you said you were gonna keep that sheathed? Deputy earp. Can't fault a man when he hears footsteps coming up from behind him. Can I help you? In fact you can. You know I'm always one to go out of my way to be helpful to the law. Now, we both know that ain't true. What do you want then? You're riding out. I got a line on dart. I hear he's hold up west of the wash, so I figured I'd round up his hide before the sun sets. I have a different idea. Why don't you ride on east until you hit New Orleans. You'll probably make it there just in time for mardi gras. Deputy, that does sound like fun. A little crawfish, a little jambalaya. But also, that sounds like you're asking me to leave town. Well your ears work just fine. But my work here isn't done. It is. Do you want me to lose my bounty? Is that it? I don't want any trouble. Well I don't want any trouble from you. From Hannah. Well what business is she to you? You say you're here for dart. I can tell there's gonna be trouble between you two. Well if she wants to make something, I'm not backing down. You don't understand. If you hurt her, I will track you down, and I will kill you. That talk don't fit that badge, boy. Try me. See how fast I throw it away. Hannah, you think you could get away with it? Wyatt, Wyatt, I... Just sneak out of town without saying good bye? Yeah, I told you I'd be setting out early. It's a nice day for a ride, I thought I'd tag along. That's mighty obliging, but I don't need a posse. I'll be tracking, and I do that better alone. I was thinking, Hannah, maybe you should let someone else take this one. Stitch the back shooter? Why are you so hell bent on going after this man? There's something you're not telling me. I told you everything you need to know, just leave me be. Yeah just remember, sometimes no matter how strong a person thinks they might be, there comes a time when they need someone to back them up. When that time comes, Wyatt, I'm glad to know I can count on you. This just isn't that time. You see what he did? He walked his horse through here backward. He's good. I'm better. Trained you good. Want some coffee? There's people looking for you all over the territory. You should be running a cold camp. I know they'll come looking for me. How'd you get your picture on that poster, isom? I thought you were smarter than that. Funny story. Funny if you telling it, not if you living it. I came across an overturned buckboard, man was trapped under the wheel, hurt real bad. I put him on one of those horses and run him back into the nearest town. Never could make coffee as good as you could. The story? I don't see how all this ends up with you wanted. Well it turns out, it was the town sheriff, one of the trailer bank robbers. When he died, the town people decided that I did him in. Idiots. If I had killed a man, why would I have brought him back into town? You tell them that? I tried to. Sounds like a case of them reading the wrong brand. Come in with me. Tell your story and be tried. They don't try black men, Hannah, you know that. They hang them. And so, I'm gonna pick up my rifle, get on my horse, and get a right outta here. If you wanna stop me, you best shoot me right now. - I was just kidding. - It wasn't me. I told you I wasn't the only one looking for you. Who is it? Bounty hunter named stitch. Is he good? Not good enough to track you. Yeah, just good enough to follow you. At least he's a good shot. A buffalo hunter. Perfect, long range marksman. He could wait us out. What's your out? You picked a nice place to make a campsite. So what do you say we do now? I know what he'll do. Wait until it gets dark, move in, and kill both of us, get the reward. Got a toothache, Wyatt? Take a seat, I'm on a roll. I'll never be drunk enough to let you touch my teeth. Well, I'm drunk enough. Now, really Wyatt, you must believe me when I tell you that I was quite a good dentist back in Atlanta. We ain't in Atlanta, John Henry. This isn't up to your usual level of banter. Something's bothering you. Hannah, you're worried about her. Never did that before. There's something personal in this. That makes it dangerous. I don't understand that woman. I do. I think I know her like I know myself. I think personal is all she has. Shucks. This remind you of anything? New Mexico, Jesse Evans and the boys. Dumbest, dumbest outlaws to ever draw a breath. But we got out of it. We always came out on top. Yeah. Why'd we stop? I wonder how long he's gonna wait before he move in here? Answer my question. One day you just up and said, you're on your own now, girl. Why? When I met you, you were fresh out of the orphanage. You saved my life. Yeah, you asked me to teach you to hunt men. And I did it. You didn't need me anymore. Bull. Look, ok, look hanny. You're like a daughter to me. And this quest for revenge, yours was bound to get you killed one day, and I didn't want to be there and see it happen. It hasn't yet. That's just lucky. Maybe your luck's run out. Maybe not. - You stay here. - Where you going? I told you to stay out of my way. Argh! You shoot first. You're as bad as the men we hunt. No, they're bad. They're wanted. What are you gonna do now, little miss bring 'em in alive? You gonna shoot me? That's $500 just riding away! What the hell does an outlaw mean to you anyway? He's just a damn... Umph! He's better than you. Get down to king's and get me two boxes of 44. What is this?! He tried to kill me. She got in my way. You... What are you so all fired happy about? Well Wyatt, I'll be out of here soon enough. To hang from a rope. I don't think so. You just don't get it, girl. All of this, I was just sent to deliver you a message. And what's the message? He's coming. Who? Here's the thing, you've been doing a fine job of picking us off one by one, little girl, but he ain't coming alone. He's got himself a new gang, killers wanted from Colorado, all the way to Saint Louis. And he's coming for you. Who? Frank mcmurphy. In two days, he'll be riding into dodge. He's coming for you. Let him come. He's coming for you. 12 hired men, and lockwood wants to see you. Yeah, that's what he said. What are they after you for? I guess because I brought in three of his gang. Well we'll just have to get the whole town to join in. Send those polecats back where they came from. Now, you know the folks in this town ain't gonna risk their necks for nobody. I can't ask anybody to do that for me, anyway. It's my fight. I am the law now, remember, that's our job. I didn't get your opinion. Yes, um, he who runs away lives... Well lives. So you're not volunteering to help? I do not like the odds. I'll go talk to deger. It's time I go see lockwood. Lockwood. You're making the big-time girl. I'll see you both later. Unless you're leavin' town. If so, I'll say my goodbyes now, then. You a right bastard. An accurate assessment, Mary. How could you do that? Do what? I ain't blind, dentist. I see what's happening between y'all. And? Don't you care nothing about that girl? More than I realized. Then why ain't you helping her then? I am. If I join her, she'll stay and fight. If she fights, she may die. I would like for Hannah to live. Miss beaumont, sir. Miss beaumont. Mr. Lockwood. Won't you join me for breakfast? No? Would you care for some whiskey? I don't mean to insult you, I just never met a female bounty hunter before. What is it that you want? Well, we never met. I don't buy cattle, or use the services of your prostitutes, or your gambling parlor. When would we have met? Your mouth runs faster than that gun comes off your hip. Now, come here a minute. I try not to waste ammunition or words. As I said coming in, what is the purpose of this meeting? Just come on down here for a second, take a look out here with me. Come on, don't be afraid of falling. I'm not afraid of falling, I'm afraid of landing. That's very good. Now, what do you see? Dodge. Alright, but me I see a city. A city that the wags out east call the wickedest city in all America, and they are not far from wrong. Every manner of vice known to man could be perpetrated on the other side of the tracks, and every rustler and buffalo hunter, gambler, cowboy, renegade, Indian, lawman and badman, they all pass through here, and some of them stay. Some stay forever, right up there, right on boot hill. Ok now, you hear that? Listen. Now that ain't the sound of thunder, you know what that is, right there, that's power. Right there is my power. Beef on hoof. Driven all the way up from the chisholm trail, get on! That is why I sit up here and I have my breakfast, watch the herd come in. There's nothing quite like it. What were we talking about again? Ok, dodge city sits at the cross roads between east and west, it is the portal through which all commerce, both legal and illicit, passes through, and the man who controls that gateway, well he controls all that passes through it. You follow me? Well from what I can see you're just about the most powerful man within a thousand miles of here. Yeah, just about. So what is it you want with me? I'm aware of your upcoming conflict with frank mcmurphy. Who isn't? Well the difference is, I would like to see no such conflict transpire in dodge city. I'm touched. Well you need not be, my concern is not for you, it is for the town. I don't want to see frank mcmurphy and his men reduce it to rubble. Well that's clear enough, and for you, rarely honest. I have devised a mutually beneficial solution for both of us. One that is financially beneficial. You're offering me money to leave town. I feel like one of your women. But you are... I don't think so. Well you haven't heard how much yet. And you think that would matter to me? Well, I don't know. Now we've met at least. Miss beaumont. No one will help you. You know? What makes you so sure? This is my town. What makes you so sure? I thought you were long gone. If you were smart, you'd run away. Of course, if you were smart, you wouldn't have let me go. So take one piece of advice from me. What? Ride out of here. And go where? Alaska. No, seriously, come with me. Yukon territory is beautiful. And freeze my off? Let's start a new life. Hey, they got bad guys up in Alaska too, you know. Not the ones I'm looking for. Well, I tried. One last lesson. Remember when I said there'd be a time when the fight wouldn't be fair? Yeah. This is it. You're not gonna take this bunch in alive. Prepared for that? Ok. There's only one way you're gonna live through this day. I'm all ears. You gotta control the fight, girl. Stay on your feet, you move better. You start with your rifle when they're at a distance. And when they get closer, time for the shotgun. And when it gets all close and dirty, then you go to your hog leg. You're not gonna be around? I came here to take you away. I'm too old to fight. I don't fancy dying in Kansas. You're on your own now, girl. Doesn't the stable have someone who does that? Yup, me. Yeah, they're like my children. I take care of them, and they take care of me. Beautiful. Well, help then. Been trying to stir up men to help, Hannah, but I'm afraid this town is populated with nothing but geldings. You know I wanna be right beside you, Hannah. I know. Bastard lockwood. He's sending me out on a stage run, right after sunrise. I would be ten miles outside of dodge long before that mcmurphy gang even get here. Well, it's official then, I'm alone. Well, you can always run. Ok, why not? Can you at least tell me that? They killed my family. Mcmurphy's gang. I was just a kid. Sweet Jesus. The only reason they didn't get me is because I was hid in a barn. Maybe I was meant to die that day. I laid in that barn and I prayed. I prayed that someone would come and stop them. No one came. So I became that person. That person who would be there when others needed help. And I would track down those men. That's why I picked dodge, because I knew that eventually every outlaw would walk through the doors of the long branch, and with every man, I wondered, would I ever get to mcmurphy himself, and now he's coming. Yeah, but tomorrow he ain't coming alone. I ain't afraid to die. What are you afraid of? What'll happen if I win? I've chased these men through my nightmares for 12 years. 12 years. When this is over, who will I be? It's a fine day for it. I would say so, sir. I ain't going! You have your orders. Those settlers have asked for our help. I can't leave town now! Yeah, you can't leave town now, Wyatt, you're gonna miss all the fun. Hold your tongue! Wyatt, we don't get to enforce the laws we want, when we want to. So if you have a problem with that, you take that badge off right now. No, sir. Hey Wyatt. Mornin' Hannah. Mornin'. Going for a ride? Deger's ordering me out of town. Lockwood's doing. They're stacking the deck against you. Hannah, you gotta know, being a lawman is the only thing I ever been good at, but if you want me to stay here with you... You have to do what they tell you. But you don't have to do this. Ride out with me. It's too late for that. Alright gentlemen. Well gentlemen, as expected, our lady bounty hunter has made herself scarce. Hack, you get turk and stitch out of the hoosegow, and redwing, you check out the boarding house. It's not like the little trollop's gonna step out onto the street and let us shoot her full of lead. Well I'll be. You are the lady bounty hunter, I surmise. I hear you got a bee in your bonnet for us all. Not all of ya. You there. You men who are new. I have no quarrel with you, you can ride on outta here. My men ride where I ride. I had to give them a chance. Now what? Are you gonna kill us all? Those of you who don't come in to face the law, yeah. Anyone who wants to live, throw down your guns. What is she thinking? She's all alone. Maybe she ain't alone. Maybe she got other guns on us right now. I say she's bluffing. Lockwood said she's alone, she's alone. Ain't nobody in this town gonna stick their neck out for her. She ain't more... She's just barely a woman. Alright gentlemen, take her. - Let's do it! - Let's go! Move in you fools, you're too far away! You've gotta control the fight, girl. You start with your rifle, when you're at a distance. Get in there! Get her! Too far away, move in on her. Nobody kills her, bring her to me! I want her now! Aw! Boss, you alright? Don't just stand around here, find her, kill her. And when they get closer, time for the shotgun. Move your, girl! Unless you want it shot off. Ya! Come on! Come on! Come on, tumbleweed! Nice shooting, Mary. Whoo! Come on! Yaw! Come on! Come on! Come on! You said it would be a cake walk! Find her! Kill her! Lauren. Sir? Get my rifle. Yes sir. It's a damn slaughter out there. What the hell are you doing here? My job. You let them out? Get out of here this minute or you will not have a job. I'm only gonna say this once! Get to fighting, or get to running. Behind you, mare! Come out, boy! Wyatt! Keep down. Hey! I got you now. The animal is always the most dangerous when it's cornered. You greenhorn. Heh... heh... I'm gonna skin your butt. And nail your hide to my barn wall. I don't think so. I told you, your need for revenge is what would get me killed one day. You were finally right about something. Had to be, eventually. Why the hell did you come back? Had to help my little girl. Hannah? Hannah? Hannah. We got the others, but mcmurphy's hold up in the church. Hannah! He has the kids. Hannah! - Wyatt! Help Mattie! - Hannah! Come on, let's go. Come on, get 'em outta here, get 'em outta here. And when it gets close and dirty, you go to your hog leg. Let the girl go. Well I don't think that would be wise. I suspect this pretty little thing here is the only thing keeping you from putting a 45 caliber hole in my hide. Another 45 caliber hole. Now, you lay your gun down, and you clear a path to that door. No. Back away, or I'll cut you down. Like you killed my family? Ha, I killed your... Abilene, 12 ago, you killed them for our horses. That's what this is about. I remember now. I don't remember seeing you, though. I saw you. All of you. Find Mattie. Aw, Nice shot, that old black outlaw, he taught you well. He just taught me to shoot. You taught me to hate. Ha ha ha and you kept all that hate simmering inside you all these years? It's kind of impressive. Well, better finish it. It is finished. It's not over till one of us is dead. No, I'm giving you to the law. My only regret is that I can't see you hung separately for each innocent life you took. My father, my mother, my brother. Brother? Caleb. Hell, I didn't kill your brother. What are you talking about? Well, I killed your parents, yeah, that's for sure, but the blonde haired honker, well, we didn't kill him. We took him. You're lying. You know I'm not. He's alive. Well at least he was, last time I saw him. Where is he? We took him, and we raised him up real good, to be a real good outlaw like me. Where? Let that hammer fall, and then you'll never know. Let them hang me, and you never know. Aw, who thought it would end like this? Argh! No. Where is my brother? Where? Wouldn't you like to know, ha ha. Hannah, I had to. He was gonna shoot you. Hey. Hannah. You coulda taken the money. Hannah. Well, yes, of course, darling, you're welcome. Mary. Thought you weren't coming to this dance? Yes, well, I liked the odds. I may have been wrong. Wyatt Berry stapp earp, the grateful people of dodge city promote you from assistant Marshall to city Marshall. Berry? What kind of a name is that? Hush. Hannah darling, he's a huckleberry. And deger, get out of dodge. You going? Should I stay? Your call. Dodge city is a bit too tame for me, I think. I hear they've discovered sliver in Arizona. A town called tombstone. Wide open boom town. Sounds more like your style. Yeah. Perhaps I'll make my way there. Doc? Yes, my Scarlet queen. Thanks. Well, hanny... You figure out who you are? Well, you can always buy yourself a dress, some books, make yourself the town school mom. I don't think so. I'm not done yet. I thought you found them all. There's one more man left to find. And kill? Not this one.
