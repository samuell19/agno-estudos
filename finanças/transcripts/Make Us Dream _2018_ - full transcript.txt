Translation: koala676 [Gerard] This is what a Liverpool kid can get. The most wonderful experience: Become the local boy who is focused on all eyes I have achieved my dreams of achievement. I have spent a lot Never imagined the night and experience Along the way I have also experienced some unusual cruel setbacks. In fact, I have never thought of the feelings caused by these setbacks. Will accompany me after my career But I think this is part of it. Is part of competitive football Football is not just about going to the stadium. It means you have to deal with all the things that come with it. Los Angeles September 2016 I just think it’s time to pull back and retreat. Not only leaving the team but also leaving the city Get out of it and take a break My mind is still sizzling for that moment. Trying to find an answer trying to find the reason However, nothing Nothing What is different here is I can escape from football I never played for fame. Before I knew it, football was already in my blood. The environment I grew up I am ready To be Liverpool for my people Take the pressure to become a professional player I can determine a fact: I was born for this. Red child dreams In Liverpool Only football can get full investment You can hardly persuade people to talk about other topics. Even if a person walks into the stadium You also know that there will be 28,000 partners. Sing with you loudly You know so clearly Liverpool scored 5 goals And this may also enter more Poor Arsenal became a knife Southern Trophy appearance Will be awarded to the league champion Phil Crawford! [Xiangli] I am coming to Liverpool. I will wrap this belief into the bones of the boys. It’s their pleasure to play for you. Bill Shankly Liverpool head coach 1959-1974 Britain's most successful club The four European Champions Cups won Proudly shine in the honor showroom of Anfield Liverpool is the European champion! How happy it is. Last Saturday, relying on Kenny Dalglish’s goal Liverpool will be the league champion of the season Income pocket For this difficult period Within the stadium Maintained a record of continued success Kenny Dalglish Liverpool head coach Liverpool at the time Is one of the highest unemployment rates in the UK For many people Football is probably the way to let them forget the loss Liverpool Haydn Haydn is just a small place There is only one point on the map. We live in a government welfare room. Ring lily community Father Paul Gerard In our place, we must take care of ourselves. Everyone lost their jobs That is not a good time. But people have to pass and pass And we will still follow the team to the end of the earth We are all breathing football British football in the 80s Merseyside monopoly Liverpool won this decade 6 top league titles This is the most popular team in the country. The fans saw a team that is often unmatched. Not only superior in ability but also extremely powerful in determination nice shot What a beautiful goal, from Dalglish Their father Go to the scene and watch all the matches. Wembley, the cup final, all matches At that time, almost everyone I knew supported Liverpool. Neighboring friend Everyone looks after each other Female Julie Bryan Steven is a good boy Temper temperature Always laughing They are our whole world We hope they will never be hurt So we want them to stay where we can see. We are quite lucky at this point. Never need to find them everywhere. They don’t want to go anywhere Just thinking about playing football [Father Paul] He kicks children's games I took him to him on Saturday morning. They won 27 to 0 He scored 12 goals Still like nothing They say this is a gift He has talent Born to have I used to go to the local bar for a drink. Then there is a brother of the team who told me "This little guy can go all the way to the end. You know this, right?" I replied, "I don't know. Who can guarantee it?" He said, "I can guarantee Steven can go all the way to success" When he first went to Liverpool, he should be 8 years old. This is the training ground of Liverpool. Like the Fort Knox (US Treasury) The value of this land is invaluable In the past generation This is the most successful club in England. There is no sign of abating now. Liverpool coach Hugh McCauley He is still very small Very small, not a little Flying around on the field I have passed one or two people in the brush. As if they don't exist You will think "God" In Liverpool Victory is the first And he is just eager to win He watched you listen to your teaching The eyes are always focused and never lost You will think when you look at him. "Well, this child can become" [Gerard] I just like to play football. Also support Liverpool It’s fun for me. Please come up with the following players Steven Gerard Phil Thompson Kevin Hanon [Gerard] From my age of eight or nine They know that I have a chance to succeed. And I have no knowledge of it. I am probably immersed in my own world. I just love to play football. Can't wait to play Liverpool sings all the way Advance to the semifinals, full of confidence People think so far Good grades this season However, the season is not over yet [Father Paul] I went to the next day. Go to the bar and meet my dad. [Reporter] Let us turn to Hillsborough [Father Paul] followed I saw it on TV... [Reporter] A major accident occurred. [Father Paul] He said "There is trouble there." I looked again "God, it looks very bad." No matter what is going on" [Reporter] A mess The police have brought reinforcements as much as possible [Father Paul] Steven was only 9 years old. Still a child I told him Someone was killed there. In Liverpool and Nottingham Forest The beginning of the FA Cup semi-final In the history of British sports The most terrible disaster The death toll has risen to 94 24 of them have been confirmed Including a 10-year-old boy [Mother Julie] Paul's mother 7 am the next morning Call us out of bed Tell us Jon Paul Steven's cousin Die in Hillsborough Jon Paul Gilhuli Cousin That is one of the saddest days of our lives. [Gerard] At that age, you are still not sensible. Still just a doll I remember going to the stadium. Seeing flowers and scarves covered with Kop stands Football is put to the side Everyone is concerned about People family emotion And the sadness of losing love [母朱莉] He will ask "Mom, what happened to Jon Paul?" How can he die?" Too sad Everyone who knows is dead in Hillsborough. I have been watching the ball in the Kop stand for 28 years. I just told him to leave my ball cap and scarf there. I won't go there again. He will never go again We all fell from the bicycle, right? Some people may just walk away I don’t want to ride anymore. Still others will want to go back to the car right away. Because they love cycling John Williams is a sociologist He was also in Hillsborough I witnessed the disaster with Rogan Taylor. [Williams] I believe for many people This makes them more convinced Football is really bringing people in the city together. Let's open the topic One of the things that talk to each other But the club is completely plunged into turmoil Another minute McMahon apparently got the news from the fans. The last game of the season We play Arsenal Lost in the most dramatic way England top league Liverpool vs Arsenal May 26, 1989 Thomas flies through the midfield Thomas! Goals are at your fingertips! Thomas! Just at the last moment An incredible season climax Entering the injury stoppage Liverpool players are hard to hide [Father Paul] After Hillsborough Everything has changed Arsenal won the 1989 league title People's faces are full Traces left by Liverpool Football Club Same as weather-beaten Do you understand what I mean? Terrible, terrible [Daglish] I have been fighting for 20 years on the front line. Echo: Dalglish retired After 20 years of success and high intensity Football career... I really... Kenny Dalglish is just a I have pushed myself to the limit of mortals. [Williams] Hillsborough caused the earthquake Changed the course Leading the sport to repackaging and promotion Sky TV entry Injecting money into football Football has become unrecognizable since then With the revolution of football in the 1990s Money factors have become more and more important There is a club inside and outside the stadium. Leading these changes That is Manchester United. For us The most obvious signal of change is We can't win the league championship again. We lost the power to control the overall situation Steve Bruce is Manchester United Raised the Premier League trophy Winning the championship for the third time in four years [Coach Macquarie] For Liverpool That means a new period has begun. a different era Even in the transition period of the Liverpool team People still demand success The fans will still be present in every game. Again We need to see hope again next And there is a guy here. Always rushing forward Every time you go to teach, you are full of hopes. [Mother Julie] Steve Haiwei came to our house Talking to me and his dad about Steven Said that he is very dazzling on the court "We want to train him" This is their original words "We want to train him" He said, "Don't force him to do anything. They will be rebellious Just stay with me. He will choose the right way to go" I will never forget his words. [Father Paul] Steven and football Become the whole of my life I will never miss As long as he has a match I will go see him performance. I will tell him, I said, "You have the ability. "But you have to use your ability to do it. It’s impossible to get something for nothing without working hard." That is the motto I gave him. "You can get it if you invest." [Coach Macquarie] From the first day He is clearly aware People's expectations of him And that’s exactly what he crave That can help him keep improving But he is also very sensitive He is a sensitive boy Many ideas are closed in my heart. What he needs to do at that time is to learn a high level of confrontation. And to learn this can only be done by working with the best players. Even though your job is to manage the entire team Your eyes are focused on those two people. Those you know have more potential Promote to a higher level Michael Owen Liverpool teammates The player also has a ball dealer You either have or you don’t have There is such a consensus between us Stepping onto the court, that’s where you belong. Whenever I see Stevie got the ball Immediately refreshed I know what he is thinking. He also knows what I am thinking. I will think, "I have a chance to score, I can score" Stevie continues to create scoring opportunities One ball after another [Father Paul] Steven got the ball The first one to find is him. He just knows that you know it, just like psychic. They are two Wonderful [Gerard] I used to play before. But everyone who sees a big guy in the opponent team I will want to get rid of him first. I think if I get him in the morning The other person on the opposite side will know that I am amazing. [Father Paul] One day coach pulled me aside Say to me, "He shoveled people and killed them. Smash them into slag" I said, "Is that not what you want?" He said, "No, he even has to us. And when the staff are like this, it’s not it." [Female Julie] on the field You must be a tough guy He was embarrassed when he left football. If they lose the ball, he will become very quiet. very quiet Steven always punished himself Be honest with yourself The only thing I can say to him is "Don't be too harsh on yourself. Steven" But football is his world. [Coach Macquarie] Whenever I meet Outstanding young talent As a coach That is your lifeline But only put them on the court Let them try their hand You can be sure Because that is the real test Stepping into the white line of the stadium, can you hold it? Hold back pressure This is the magic of this sport. Miracle Also heartbreak This makes the football look like today. [Gerard] The cricket of the stadium is indescribable Really sit on the bench and warm up Only see a sea of ​​people Heart is jumping Davidson His possession allowed Hagrim to have a chance However, Haigm... English Premier League Liverpool vs Blackburn November 29, 1998 [Gerard] saw the coach nodded You have an unreal feeling Very scary [Competition commentary]...lifted from the youth team Appear on the team's roster He is about to get a chance to play for Liverpool. Fresh face [Father Paul] I have to marry myself. "Does this really happen? My lad, this is true" Don't make mistakes, don't make mistakes [Competition commentary] passed to Owen Youth's team [Gerard] We actually only play three or four minutes. But I remember going home after the game. My dad told me right away. "No one can take this away You played for the first team of Liverpool." It immediately feels like everything is full. But then come back to reality I understand that this is just the beginning. My life has changed After my first show, my life changed very quickly. The door to the real game is open Once there, go there Standing on the grass You are either ready Either exposed to the weakness of the team You have nowhere to hide [Owen] Everything changes quickly No chance to come back You have to make one decision At the end of the minutiae Judged within 5 seconds The next game is going This is not a dream This is what is happening [Competition commentary] Redknapp Found the pass route Fowler played beautifully Owen... The ball is still at the foot... [Gerard] The level of competition around you Highly dizzy They can run rumors Tall and strong This is the real match. The opponent hates you That hate Will seep out from the confrontation [Competition commentary] between him and Westwood a fierce collision They both have trouble As a young player in the first team of Liverpool You must show something Otherwise, I will never get a chance to play again. Jami Carragher Liverpool teammates Must be impressed Don't expect someone to give you 10 times 20 times. Impossible I was very aggressive at the time. The same is true for Stevie. [Competition commentary] Bambi is well spread for Everton Campbell hit a wall That is the young Gerard. Referee shows red card Merseyside Derby is boiling again Even though it was a bad interception I saw the positive side. I think "this guy is not afraid at all. "He is ready Just waiting to put yourself there." We point the topic to the salary of the player. In the late 1990s, this was a huge industry. Agent Stuart Marshall will discuss with me Stulan Marshall Broker I started in my 20s. Acting as a player's agent That is the beginning of commercialization of football. Players are gradually becoming Genuine star From club to player Everything is changing dramatically David, what do you think of this change? Obviously, power has changed. The players are the objects that everyone goes to see. They are the selling point I saw the opportunity But the level of the broker Looking at whether the players are outstanding I have to find someone with great talent. Take me to a higher level The discussion about him has been one after another. The authority I know Clearly stated that he is the future We meet in the living room Talk to his parents His father dismissed us But Stevie controls the conversation. He asked me questions Far more than I asked him English Premier League Liverpool vs Xie Wednesday December 5, 1999 That also made me see some signs. "This guy has a play. No matter who stands next to him I hope I can stand there." Now for Liverpool Attack may be the best defense Gerard What a wonderful string of balls Wonderful goal! From Steven Gerrard! The first goal he scored for Liverpool Meet the difficulties Only 19 years old One-stop goal Liverpool 3 to 1 lead Xie Wednesday Steven Gerrard hits a fatal [Williams] When he first came to the team He is so green, wholeheartedly Driven by emotions Even though he is still young, we feel "God, he should be everything we want." He may be omnipotent" Gerard! Steven Gerrard helps Liverpool score Absolutely perfect Gerrard is taking the ball again. He shot long distance Wonderful from Steven Gerrard's score Murphy unloading Running route to Gerard What a wonderful goal I started to work on the field. Danny Wise has a squabble with Gerrard [Father Paul] I pay attention to him. No mind to pay attention to what other players are doing. This will affect my overall view But I still can't believe it. Unable to understand Some of his achievements [Owen] When the state comes out, There will be strength in the heart Let you believe in yourself Invincible You will be the best one on the field. Football Cup Finals Liverpool vs Arsenal May 12, 2001 We used to look up at those players who sighed. Then suddenly I and Stevie became part of it. Babel tried to get the ball Owen! Liverpool regains control Thanks to Michael Owen Liverpool European Union Cup finals Liverpool vs Aravis May 16, 2001 Harman passed to Owen Gerard is in front of a gap Gerard’s good opportunity 2 to 0 Liverpool [Gerard] can use his own performance Let so many people who follow us feel happy Is a wonderful taste You hardly know what you did. Until you get home See the news on TV I am growing up Become a man [Eriksson] first place in 2001 The winner is... [Gerard] Winning the Best of the Year I feel that everything has improved. [Eriksson] ... Steven Gerrard. [Agent Marshall] That night His award is not a key point in itself. Focus on the door to a higher stage Opened to him His plan is to conquer the world Going to the peak I can't say that I want to go abroad to play, right? [Agent Marshall] Next to Liverpool Club Go with him to success My ambition is to play for Liverpool. So you can go this step I'm very grateful I hope I can work with this team. Win many trophies Stay here as long as possible [Coach Macquarie] fans love The local guy who paid everything for the red shirt In many ways, it can be said He is their blood Steven is them The shining example that I want to see day after day This guy can even be for your team Bumping through a brick wall Stubbs header The ball returns to the foot of Gerard Wonderful goal [Coach Macquarie] But for Liverpool fans Before Liverpool win the league title They will never stop That's the way it is They are continually craving Craving for Liverpool to win In 1982 he was at the price of 1 pound. I bought Chelsea. And now Ken Bates will be in the hands The vast majority of equity I sold it for £30 million. Russian billionaire Roman Abranovic Chelsea has never been able to The financial strength of a team like Manchester United But now the situation has changed. [Agent Marshall] New owner comes in Everyone will always tell the legend They have to spend money for the team. Say they will do this But actually they rarely do that really English Premier League Liverpool vs Chelsea August 17, 2003 Came to Anfield for nearly 70 years. Chelsea has only won one league victory here. This is the strength of their newcomers behind the scenes. One quick test [Agent Marshall] Yes, yes, this time is different. This time is really coming [Williams] is hard to imagine Someone waving a check I ran to buy a club and said "We will become stronger than you" Scorpio actually bought Chelsea. Since the mid-1950s Chelsea never won the league again. Suddenly, they changed their face. For competitive sports like football History can be forgotten so quickly Calling people I am very happy to officially announce this morning. Jose Mourinho Will immediately become the new head coach of Chelsea Football is changing Society is changing The world is changing I believe in the club All want to put their potential Success into reality But more importantly I have to find a player who is consistent with my thinking. We have to be brave to say "we want to win" [Gerard] When Chelsea started Spend 30 million new players in each position For me, the person aiming at the league title The pattern was suddenly broken The rules of the game are different. And my eagerness and ambition Hard to accept all this It’s incredible to think of it. They won the league title last time. It’s been 12 years ago. A whole generation of fans have grown up But don't know Liverpool's taste as a league champion [Gerard] I always instinctively Defend the club But there are concepts in my heart. Clearly we are not good enough In this case, how can I get it? Win the league and the Champions League That thought made me feel bad. Even more heartbreaking is When you are with their players You will talk, they will say "The next three or four years Can Liverpool be competitive enough?" So you start to question your ambitions But for a player Ambition is a complicated word [Agent Marshall] Chelsea is searching for talent Mourinho, this bright young coach Very eager to sign him And I am not a Liverpool fan, do you understand? I am not a Liverpool fan. I am responsible for the football career of Steven Gerrard. For his career What to do is the best Fight for trophies Medals Results? With the arrival of the new coach Rafa Benitez He made Gerard believe Liverpool can create brilliant challenges and top honors Merseyside also took a sigh of relief Gerard’s decision Nature will not make Chelsea happy According to reports they are eager Signed the player with 36 million Michael Owen said If Gerard leaves Anfield Will be a huge disaster They are now spared The big problem now is Will Owen stay in Liverpool? [Carragher] When he received the call I am staying with Michael. My first reaction was "If I don't go" I always look at the big picture. I will think, "How will people see you in the future?" I also understand your thoughts. You will want to compete with the best players in the world. But that will create a crack And may never be smoothed out So is it worth it? Real Madrid press conference August 2004 [Owen] I want to Mr. Chairman. Special thanks Give me a chance Play for the best team in the world thank you very much That is the temptation to win the victory. Achieve the goal from small to large I said to myself, "If you choose to refuse "May be the rest of my life I will think again and again "What will happen if you go?" So I have to try it out" [Coach Macquarie] emotionally That is a tough time After all, these people I followed you from an early age. Michael is definitely a superstar But at that time What can he win with Liverpool? After all, the last football is only about victory. You thought they would play for Liverpool for a lifetime. But you will think "wait Why do we think this is taken for granted?" They don't owe anything to Liverpool. [Gerard] I always default We will go hand in hand to the peak We are always together Worse, this will affect me. This will affect us But when the whistle sounds You have to put your personal feelings aside The player we lost Is Steven's best partner on the field. Now he is the strongest of us Once Liverpool didn’t play well I have to rely on Stevie to turn the tide. Tokic Create a shot space How many wonderful scores We all know how strong Gerrard is. How important is this Liverpool But they shouldn’t rely on him alone. And now it looks like this is the case. [Williams] Our lineup is average Benitez does not like to be very close to the players. He doesn't have that kind of emotional power Did not send more experienced veteran players tonight Is there some missteps? I do not think so - Are you satisfied with them? - Are you referring to players on the field? Of course, they have worked hard. [Williams] So our feelings for Steven Bittersweet On the one hand, he is given full trust and hope. On the other hand, thinking about it almost desperately What must we win? To ensure that he will not be dug away Li said in Spain "As a Liverpool fan This is 30 years I feel one of the most shameful nights" We don’t have the chance to win the league championship The same for the Champions League I think that is what I have seen. One of Liverpool's worst performances I can hardly think of it. There is such a bad game. [Agent Marshall] That season, the mood is ups and downs like a roller coaster. Day after day, week after week Everything is gradually surrounding him. Liverpool captain Steven Gerard Calling for support from fans The Red Army needs a victory To ensure the promotion of the Champions League knockout Liverpool last time on the top of Europe Still 20 years ago Tonight, they only win To ensure their fans Can continue to have expectations for glory in May The guest at Anfield is Olympiax... Harvey Alonso smashed Rivaldo's jersey Champions League group match Liverpool vs Olympiacos December 8, 2004 Still Rivaldo or him Haipia foul 19 minutes from the intermission Anfield is now 0-0 But Olympiacos got a chance Into the low ball! Kirkland has no response One foot shot through the goal Liverpool 0-1 behind Olympiacos [Carragher] The situation is not good At that time, he definitely felt that the responsibility on his shoulders was even heavier. Probably the idea of ​​the remaining 10 players All the same Let Stevie come Let him take a penalty kick Or pass the ball to Stevie He will shoot Then 40,000 people in the audience also think so. Stevie is watching you. According to the current score, Olympiacos will advance Unless Liverpool can score another goal Mailer’s header is beautifully unloaded. Gerard! Steven Gerrard! The goal for Liverpool to score the third goal tonight is Steven Gerard Wife Alex Gerald When I first met him He is just a kicker. Live in your own dreams I don't think he realizes What is waiting for him in front? Obviously forced by his responsibility He has grown a lot But at the time, we were still very young. On the court, he always behave aggressively. I will think "God" Going home, he has become a personal No longer afraid of emotions I think he is looking forward to returning home early. Be yourself [Gerard] I am the captain of Liverpool. Liverpool captain can always hand over satisfactory answers They have to Have such a history Such a tradition is so successful Can I afford it? Am I good enough? I will be in their mouth "I have never won anything," is one of the captains? This heavy burden of expectations Always occupy my mind [Coach Macquarie] Playing for Liverpool He put too much pressure on his shoulder He also needs to be able to have his arms around him. Just show a little care. Can make everything different But Rafa is not this character. He is very cold in this regard. I am there, I can see Steven's loss. [Gerard] I am eager to succeed And everything that comes with the game And the coolness of Rafa is like pouring oil on fire. If I don’t get love and respect here He doesn't value me as much as I think he should. I will sneak in when I left. Mourinho likes me as a player And everyone knows He is about to win a series of victories That is what catches my thoughts. Grab my ambition [Mourinho] Which team? Is it better than Chelsea? Arsenal? Sometimes they can get more praise Is it better than us? - They may get more praise. - Action They are very backward, very much. [Carragher] before the game His rumors with Chelsea are full of media layouts This idea can stand up, isn’t it? The result of this game Will determine Gerard’s future League Cup Final Liverpool vs Chelsea February 27, 2005 Once lost, it will be difficult to resist Chelsea's re-invitation If winning, then Chelsea’s season collapse That transfer to Stamford Bridge is not so attractive. [Carragher] because of his identity Gerard’s everything is carefully examined He has nowhere to hide Also because of his identity He is always watching Even a single camera followed him The last 12 minutes... Paul Ferreira is introduced into the restricted area The ball is refracted into the net. Luck is really bad And among everyone It’s actually Gerrard equalizing Chelsea. How ironic this ball is. Many people will think that Gerrard has just scored. Is the first of many goals he will play for Chelsea Under the leadership of Mourinho and Abu Chelsea enters a new era They beat Liverpool And nothing can comfort Gerrard’s. Today Gerard is a shame Every time the shovel is finished They reached out and lifted him up Shaking hands with Markleley and others what a shame I do think his mind Already drifting away Not in the Liverpool club Gerard should have served Team actor It’s a shame [Father Paul] because of that nightmare game He was severely criticized by the fans You can't help but want to jump up and fight back "Are you lost your memory or what?" He loves Liverpool He is fighting for this team" I know that he will be hit by these comments. But what can I say to him? [Gerard] That was the first time I feel lonely as a player As a heavy punch in my face You feel the responsibility to all of them That is your fault You tell yourself You feel like you are fighting alone At that moment I realized Since the peak has created the most wonderful day of my life The trough will also be the worst part [Williams] Want to know Heart is Liverpool this place It’s really wonderful and full But sometimes it will be suffocating This place may be so you can't breathe Because people’s desires are so strong I hope that you can also feel their feelings. Take such a responsibility Must be extremely disturbing He knows why he works for this club. So important to people But he also always has this question "I will become a good player with a good performance?" therefore The incredible process of the Champions League that season is crucial That gave us reasons to stick to it. Liverpool vs. Chelsea The Champions League semi-final will start half an hour later. The winner will win next month Eligibility for finals in Istanbul Second round of the Champions League semi-finals Liverpool vs Chelsea May 3, 2005 [Williams] can't write a script Meet Chelsea's bridge in the semi-final Who can think of it? [Mourinho] I take my ego came here Strong conceit Know it It’s stronger now. [Benites] They own The most expensive lineup in the world Good coach, good player But we have our fans So we are now evenly matched [Williams] fans will be the gods Know that we must also play a part The entire stadium is in a complete madness Really feels like we are Reach the impossible What will happen to the outcome? Risser Pass to Gerard’s gap 捅Barosh He grabbed the ball before Terry Goalkeeper has physical contact with Luis Garcia Did the ball pass the line? Gala pulls the ball away Goal! First goal in the semifinals Belongs to Liverpool Liverpool once again set foot on the Champions League final Finally arrived Rafa Benitez and his team Backtracking history As old times [Gerard] I entered the finals Extremely eager to win the trophy Just to write down history Take off the burden Everyone is asking Can Liverpool win the fifth Champions League trophy? Whether successful or not Will Gerrard stay in Anfield next season? [Gerard] The media is not willing to let go of rumors They are asking questions If they won tomorrow That may change everything But if they lose tomorrow night It’s not surprising that Najrad left me. [Williams] Where else? More stage than this to Steven The whole world is watching this game. Isn't that what you and all of us want? [Father Paul] We went to a group of people One of them went back and said, "Where to look at" Then you turned around I saw a piece of red covering the entire hill I have never seen such a sight. Unbeatable Such grand support Champions League Final AC Milan vs Liverpool May 25, 2005 Since Liverpool last lifted the trophy 21 years, such as the white gap Tonight is a good opportunity to recover lost time. But in the face of starlight AC Milan with multiple players in the Champions League finals experience Can Gerrard become an legend of Anfield? Just watch this campaign. [Gerard] that kind of attention That kind of momentum That magnitude Is a new height Today 50th Symbol European Football Club The highest level of the final is about to start Can go this step Hit the final We have indeed played exceptionally Don't go to the last step but messed up If we win That will be the best night of my career. If you lose, it will be difficult to get out of it. Liverpool facing tonight Is a group of talented players indeed Milan quickly entered the state as soon as it opened. Milan gets a free kick Pirlo turns the ball to the left The ball is flying high The ball went in Opening 50 seconds, Maldini scored Can you believe it Only the first minute, the captain of Milan took the lead in scoring For Liverpool This is undoubtedly the worst start. Liverpool was hit hard How do they reinvigorate from this fight? Liverpool will need their fans to come forward [Gerard] I panicked in my mind I can’t feel like this big scene Struggling very hard Feeling confused Kaka ball Trouble is coming, Shevchenko Crespo! Milan 2-0 lead The situation in Liverpool at halftime has become more and more serious. The Italian has led two goals AC Milan thinks the game has ended prematurely Very certain The entire coaching seat ran out. They are clear in their hearts Just can't believe it Crespome scored twice in five minutes AC Milan 3-0 Liverpool The final is over [Carragher] Ok, they are 1-0 ahead. This often happens But when they lead 3-0 It feels like being heartbroken For the course of the game You have had so many imaginations Will Stevie raise the trophy? That is his dream The dream of all of us And you are there suddenly realized "This is already impossible" People all over the world are watching And you are trapped In such a shameful scene The situation may also get worse This is only the midfield. [Williams] 3-0 Opposite these cold-blooded killers in Milan This obviously... is over "You will never walk alone" when people are in the midfield. Just passing such a message "Listen, although the performance is not satisfactory. "But we are still here "We can still bring 40,000 people "Influx into the cultivated land of Turkey We still can't be underestimated." But no one believes we can still Jedi counterattack in the game [Gerard] We have 45 minutes left Try to save some face I think at least this is what the fans deserve. Gattuso I feel that I have an obligation to see me. Traore steals I want to know how many players are in this team. Tonight is the last time for Liverpool Is Gerrard one of them? Passed to Louis Garcia [Gerard] I think I have to take a little more adventure. Even if it is not honored Who cares about it? I have nothing to bear with Carragher’s jealousy. I was swallowed and swallowed. Harvey Alonso Harman Harman Harvey Alonso Alonso turns to the left Pass the ball to Riise on the left Riise hits Kaka Bounced the ball back to himself Riise re-introduced the ball into the restricted area Head the ball! - The ball is in! - Liverpool's lifeline! - In addition to Captain Gerrard, who else? - team leader! Steven Gerrard's head hammer score Continue a life for Liverpool He swayed his arms to the fans Come on, believe us Milan 3-1 Liverpool Maybe Gerrard has broken a bloody road. [Williams] somehow Guess who scored a goal He also made those gestures to the crowd. That makes us realize He did not take this as a comfort goal Let us start to think "It’s hard to say things in the world." Smitz hits the door The ball is in! The ball is in! Vladimir Smitzer Liverpool scored two goals in 2 minutes Miracles are possible Started another round of offense Baros passed the ball to Gerrard! - Penalty! Penalty! - The referee gave a penalty! I can’t believe it. In the major finals I have never seen such a situation. Xavi Alonso takes the penalty He must keep his head cool Ah was saved! Make up the net! Too unreal! Liverpool with 3 goals behind halftime Within 15 minutes after the start of the second half Equalized This score is shocking AC Milan 3-3 Liverpool The Champions League final has never appeared Such a big reversal He himself is the epitome of all changes There is a spring under his feet He played with a sense of urgency As a captain, you must exert influence. Being a captain must be inspiring I think he did it in the second half. Now the tense moment is here. Fans don’t have enough nails to get into the meat. They can still fight Do you cheer for their team? Danger! Good luck! Dudek's two-in-one Less than 3 minutes Very good The last time is also used up. The eighth time in the 50-year history of the Champions League Will be won by penalty kick a penalty shootout like Russian roulette The next 5 minutes Who is Chengxiong Who is defeated? Seeing soon Flying Liverpool's dreaming start Harman strives to be the first player for Liverpool Have - scored - Elegant first hand [Gerard] looking out from the middle The ball becomes very small If you still lose in the end People won't remember you got into the ball I won't remember your second half and overtime performance. You and your team can only win Will let them keep in mind So close to honor [Gerard] I’m scared that I’m still in the end. Risser He turned his head However, has the game been reversed? [Gerard] I think is "It seems that I have to go to the round of my penalty to decide the outcome." Feeling pressure can't be bigger If Milan misses Liverpool will win the championship Shevchenko knows There is no room for any mistakes now. Shoulder If Shevchenko misses the penalty No more chances to come back Float it out! Champions League trophy back to England Return to Anfield! Liverpool once again boarded the European Championship! The most extraordinary football night The most extraordinary finale [Gerard] This responsibility and pressure finally unloaded It is heavy and scary very scary I love you! I love you guys! Fuck! [Gerard] There won't be anyone on this planet. I can understand how I feel when everything happens. I saw a photo taken by me. Pounce on the fans after the game I have no body attached. Soaring [Father Paul Gerard] There was a mess It's a mess People hug each other Kiss each other I can't say a word. I stood up and tried to reach him. But that is impossible I can only sit down Feel a piece of wood [Williams] After we won Even if I think about it now... cry As a presenter The kind of happiness that can be witnessed by the eyes I saw Steven standing in the middle of the center. "We can still do it. Even if no one believes we can No one believes we can do it And he said to all of us "I believe" This is a very pure thing Is the victory of spiritual will And the core figure of all this is Steven. That's why he is so important to us. [Gerard] You have to understand This is my life Put on the armband, put on the sneakers You are that person, this is true. Spend such a night with this team Is that what you want, isn't it? Of course, you will stay right. You will swear allegiance to this club. [Gerard] At that time Think of all the gossip I think Lafa will definitely use it now. I look at me differently. I will sign a long appointment, it’s that simple. Of course the head coach and Rick Parry Would like us to sit down as soon as possible Make a decision... After such a night How can I still leave? But it seems to me that there is no need to be so urgent. I feel that is true Rafa wants to exchange funds for me. I am not sure, my thoughts are scattered. a mess in my mind I dedicated my life to this club. I have dedicated all Maybe I am worth going to a better team. Playing for a coach who loves me Maybe leave, look forward It is a better choice for me. I feel dizzy, I am lost. Lost in dizziness He said that this is what he has done. The toughest decision Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard Have told the club that he wants to leave It’s only a few weeks since he led the team to win the Champions League. Six weeks ago, he woke up at the top of Europe. Seems to have decided to stay This morning, he turned back to the old chapter. Intent to pave the way from Anfield to Chelsea His agent claims that the renewal contract has broken down According to the newspaper Gerrard's relationship with his head coach Also broken - Shocked, sad. - Why? He is the backbone of the team. It’s the same thing. The engine is broken, the car can't move. - That’s what this Liverpool is saying. - That's right. - Gerard’s transfer - That's right. ...our team is falling apart Said to win the trophy Actually not for money He will actually consider leaving This is enough to show what he is. Let this little rogue go Let him go Get rid of Judas [Agent Marshall] That brought out people Feelings about this club They express their ideas without reservation A note was placed on the door at the end of the road. Phone text message "You dare to walk and see" "Get out of the way" "You are one of us" "You fucking better not to go" There are also naked threats I have been with him for a long time in Liverpool. Can understand his identity in the city How much distorted pressure has grown I don't want to be in his position. He once raised the Champions League trophy Although I also want to experience that taste But I am not willing to exchange positions with him. When I sit with him Seeing on the TV When the fans burned his jersey This is my idea [Williams] a player like him Only four or fifty years will come out You can only meet one in your life. If he is gone Then we can all be scattered. All of us can Go find a more successful team support Why not This sport is completely different. [Gerard] I was very young at the time. A little lost in the direction So many things happened I can't clear my mind Try to make this You don’t know the big decision right or wrong. So you need someone close to remind yourself What do you have? [Father Paul] He is at a loss I can see it. I remember I looked at him. He said, "Dad, I received these transfer invitations." I said to him, "In the end. "You have to make your own decisions. "But the fans there won't be like people here." "Love you like that. "You can't change the true color Change the way you grow up You are a Liverpool person" That is what I said to him. [Gerard] He told me "These fans worship you." "You are everything to them. "You are their hope every day. "Every day's dream "Liverpool is in your heart Put aside the things in your head "If Chelsea is in your head That's just noise "just noise "Remember where you came from "Remember who made you Liverpool is your team" It is 9:38 in the morning. Johnny Sanderson broadcasts sports news for you Steven Gerrard will stay in Liverpool This Friday, Gerrard is about to sign a four-year new contract Obviously what happened in the past few days Causing some influence [Gerard] I think that day Is the hardest part of my life. Really I am not proud of it. I was confused at the time. That is a tough day I don't want other players or anyone else to... That conversation is the best thing that happened to me. If not my dad and my brother I may have made a mistake. I guess a lot of professionals I feel that my decision at the time was wrong. But they don't understand my feelings Maybe ten out of ten Leaving is the right choice But I am not one of those eighty-nine I am the one left. [Coach Macquarie] Steven Proof He is an affectionate mortal One heart for his club For his city He put on this red shirt in the next game. "I want to lead this team as far as possible. No matter what I need to do I will do it" He represents Liverpool He is Liverpool. That year With West Ham's FA Cup final Football Cup Final Liverpool vs West Ham United May 13, 2006 One person will score that goal The ball fell to the foot of Gerrard Hit the door! Magical goal Steven Gerard Just when you think When he can't do anything anymore... [Gerard] The FA Cup Is one of the best days of my life Because I know very well What have I done for ourselves? The winner of the FA Cup final is Liverpool! I have decided Dedicating the best years to this club So very happy Can restore the bond between us tough I feel relieved feels good Like "Come, who is your opponent?" [Williams] Now he really belongs to us. But for most supporters This is not the end of the story. And it’s just the beginning of what we are committed to. What we really want to do Is to win the league title He must bring us to this trophy [Xiangli] We really want to win the league. Because I think to win the top league championship Is the ultimate challenge of British football [Gerard] I still have a trophy But the Premier League is improving overall. Faster and stronger Drogba turned and hit the door Wonderful goal! To play for the top six top eight teams You must be a world-class level Manchester United leads Henry Every team Are spending huge sums to build a championship lineup Manchester City Club Has been acquired by Arab billionaires They announced that they will put this team Made the strongest in England We are not aware of the Abu Dhabi royal family. How rich is it? We only know that it is hundreds of millions of pounds. Sufficient to despise Liverpool Manchester United Even Chelsea Waiting for the financial strength of the team owner That is what we have to do Try to make Liverpool go hand in hand with those teams Today's headlines American millionaire George Gillette Ready to take over Liverpool Football Club If Gillette’s offer is accepted He will become a recent Premier League player. Third American The first two are Malcolm Glazer of Manchester United And Randy Lerner of Aston Villa Each of them promises Will quickly bring the team to glory And that’s what Liverpool fans crave. [Co-Chair Tom Hicks] I promise all Liverpool fans We understand your expectations You want champions I also want champions. [Carragher] After the bosses came Really met our requirements That is to buy a new player at a higher level. English Premier League Manchester United vs Liverpool March 14, 2009 We signed Fernando Torres with 25 million. Mascherano also came £20 million The strength of the team has been enhanced The 2008 team lineup is the best I have ever experienced. Vidic is waiting for the ball Torres crushed the past Torres enters the restricted area for Liverpool Fernando Torres Wonderful! Gerrard’s free throw is just right. Escaping Van der Sar's ball He kissed the team logo Kissed the camera [Gerard] Can you feel it? Driver from the fans Power from fans I have to get the trophy as soon as possible. Give them what they want Alonso... Gerard rushed to the horse! Steven Gerard scored twice Liverpool scored 4 goals The battle for the championship has become more intense [Williams] that season We are really very close to the championship Manchester United [Williams] At that time, it was only a matter of time before I won the championship. However, it turns out that we are all fooled. The era of Hicks and Gillette Started in 2007 They bought the club for 290 million pounds. May earnings report again Nearly 55 million pre-tax losses Liverpool’s total debt has risen to nearly 2.8 billion Banks are on the lookout G and H are liar Don't give them a loan [Williams] It turns out that the bosses Just the opposite of the spirit of the club That is a complete betrayal I think Liverpool fans This time must be realistic. To face up to the current financial situation of the club Football has nothing to do with the economy, only about emotions. I think this is already out of control. When football returns to football itself I will be happy. [Coach Macquarie] Hicks and Gillette Changed the status of the club Forever changed people's lives Now this is a Huge huge business business Ok, we all have to change ourselves. Enlightened But in my opinion, the essence of the club was taken away. Once we were unique Liverpool used to have "the way of Liverpool" And this is not the way Liverpool I know very well what the way Liverpool should be. This is this morning when the fans are heading to Anfield. The shot we took around the court Honestly, I feel the game of today. Reminisced by Hillsborough 20 years ago Overshadowed There will be a minute of silence before the start of the game. To commemorate the anniversary of this tragedy [Carragher] Liverpool is not just a football club Also an institution based on a common philosophy Sometimes the reality hits you hard Remind you how important it is This is our club This is our life This is to stop and reflect on the past week. Wednesday is the tragedy of Hillsborough 20th anniversary Family and friends And the broader Liverpool family Will gather at Anfield Come to commemorate Of course, it’s also to celebrate new students. [Carragher] If you are a local child This meaning is completely different I am very happy to be able to work for a team that values ​​local talents. If the team does not care about this Then I will gnash my teeth. But sometimes that is not Will make us more difficult? When the situation is not good As a local player Your emotional load is multiple You will feel that you let yourself down. Stevie as captain That feeling will only double [Gerard] When the fans are united Want to reach a goal They are very, very powerful I think that also shows The spirit of the people of the city Forget the identity of the player. For their goal They always fight to the end That's exactly what they did As part of it You are proud of your hometown I want to help people I love. My family my supporters Try to make them happy But I know that I have no time. So when Torres moved to Chelsea I am very, very depressed That is a trough [Carragher] Top players turn More financially strong team You always pretend to be nothing But actually you need to keep these players To win the league title And our strength has dropped dramatically [Gerard] I am 30 years old. This body is far from being young I will endure anything in order to be able to play. Stress fracture of the back Every place in my body has been closed Push yourself to the limit and push the limit [Agent Marshall] The team is taking steps Stagnant He made all the stops Maintain this team He wants to take it May be month after month, year after year After all, it eroded his physical and mental health. Caused some damage After those games he walked into the channel The heavy burden on his shoulder is visible to the naked eye. [Father Paul] Every father who has a player son all the same You want them to win every game. Because you understand what this means to them. Unfortunately, It’s impossible to win every game. No one can do it There will always be a link, you are defeated. this picture Occupy a lot of sports layouts You can see Gerard holding a cane The patron saint of Liverpool... [Gerard] My body has gone on strike. Hanging in the groin Falling off the bone Infection caused my pelvic split After a while, I thought I was probably finished. [wife Alex] a lot of parts New infections appear one after another At that time, you felt that "this is not good" In the hospital, the doctor told us "We have to have an operation" And he keeps talking about it. "How long will it take me to play? How long will it take?" I remembered the way he talked at that moment. [Gerard] I think in my heart "Maybe this is my ending." This thought makes me sad I can't sleep at night. Seeing people lose their temper I need help I saw that my state was very bad. Covered with thick feet 2 degrees below the outside I am holding a cane in the snow Go see a psychiatrist What I think is "How can football make me fall into this situation?" Just talked for 2 minutes I just want to go. Because the first sentence he said to me is "If you are really finished, "If you really can't play anymore. what are you going to do How are you going to face it?" Wonderful is I don't want to hear these But that really played a role He led me to think Most of my friends and relatives will not let me think about it. a scene I have never imagined myself I almost really feel that I am finished. Really think of "Okay. If this is the case, then What can I do?" That makes me no longer mad, I am free. Remember that I thought "How much pressure do you put yourself under?" That's what makes me cherish What I have outside of football Make people understand "Yes, football is very important. Football is your life "But football is not everything "The family is everything People who care about you are everything." However, that is an addiction Football is addictive You always want more That kind of pressure You are eager to feel it again The trophy that once passed by Heavy again beckoning to me English Premier League Liverpool vs Everton January 28, 2014 Let me put my heart in again Too fans are silent The cheers of the Red Army fans are deafening 1-0 [Agent Marshall] He looks to the abyss Seeing him only a stone's throw from the finish line But he is not ready at all. Of course he wants to believe that they have a chance to fight But I think that is more hope More than really believe Now he has Suarez To help him reach his wish He is the leader of this young team Can Liverpool kill Arsenal? English Premier League Liverpool vs Arsenal February 8, 2014 Further consolidate the position of the top four Liverpool will pass the ball into the restricted area Liverpool leads Martin Skrtel scores [Williams] that season When Arsenal came to visit Anfield Ranked first in the standings And we wiped them out. Liverpool wins 3-0 Rahim Sterling Liverpool situation is good [Williams] The league is a long process Is a journey That season's piecemeal puzzle Gradually put together If we can squeeze out the last point Steven’s brave contribution to us over the years If Suarez can remain unharmed Maybe this is really possible We may be able to witness the miracle [Gerard] I don’t think anyone believed at first. Christmas, new year, February Along the way, we gradually accumulate Constant forward momentum You start thinking, "Can we do it?" Gerard Scalpel-like pass Sturridge enters the restricted area for Liverpool The ball bounces through the door post into the net Gerrard’s penalty hits all season This time is the same Manchester United 0-1 behind Liverpool The visiting team is ecstatic Gerard was surrounded by teammates Sturridge took the ball to the penalty area Kicked - Suarez... - The ball is in! 3 balls! No suspense! Suarez is a historic victory for Manchester United Drawn a full stop [Coach Macquarie] Steven always Be able to be friends with people on the same channel Those excellent shooters He and Suarez are also the best Long shot Oh, my word is poor. [Coach Macquarie] This team once again shows the true color of Liverpool Exciting football Louis Suarez created history [Coach Macquarie] When people go to watch the game With winning expectations Gerard also stood in front of the ball Gerard scored the penalty! [Gerard] You feel incomparable Incredible Like... You watch TV, read the newspaper You chat with people, all around this. Let go of all the emotional accumulation The higher the accumulation My life is dominated by this. Who is winning today? Who can win the league title? I think yes. If Manchester City wins I will say that they have won the championship 100%. Liverpool... also has a good chance [Carragher] That was my first season as a ball review. I have regretted my mind many times. "Why should I retire? "In order to lift the trophy I have been waiting for a lifetime." But that will still be exciting Let Stevie enjoy that moment Get that big reunion ending English Premier League Liverpool vs Manchester City April 13, 2014 Feeling will be destined Please join us now... And that day is the 25th anniversary of Hillsborough. It’s really exciting But Manchester City is the direct opponent of the title We still have to win the game. Liverpool's Sterling enters the restricted area Wonderful goal Surprised! How cool Gerard takes the corner from the left side Pointing to Skrtel! He once again faced Manchester City goals Martin Skrtel won anfield full of applause Milner Fernandinho is beautiful Classic Manchester City goal A wonderful goal from a super team David Silva Milner Milner passed to Silva in the penalty area They caught Liverpool’s gap Silva hit the door after a refraction The ball went in - Miniolet was defeated - Oh my God - Manchester City completed the Jedi counterattack - Unbelievable The fans who turned to Manchester City fell into madness. They are not lucky, Liverpool. But have to say... This is the key moment of the game. This is the key moment of the season. Ah, Kompany kicked. Coutinho! Do you believe it! Little magician created magic Liverpool’s victory was nailed This Anfield’s Sunday is worth remembering Liverpool in the league title battle Continue to stay ahead What a wonderful celebration They just got the road to winning the championship Cleared a huge obstacle 嘿 I must not let my mother relax! Hear me out! There must be no slack! Listen! Listen! This game has passed! We went to Norwich To come up with exactly the same performance! We are here again! [Coach Macquarie] Twilight is in front of you Honestly, I became very emotional. Tearless This is a man standing at the top of his career. But what I saw was not the man. But the boy I saw Steven Gerrard, 9 years old and 10 years old. He believes in everything All related to Liverpool Football Club [Gerard] I don't know Just can't help... It must be revealed that's the truth After all, I have never been so close But 48 hours before the crucial battle against Chelsea I feel panic I don't think I can catch up with the game. The back is so stiff and sore I can't get on and off freely. I basically relied on closed needles that season. Supported so many games Fix me, whatever method do you use? How can I not feel pain? What do I have to do to not feel pain I have to play this game. Anyway, I have to play this game. In reality, my situation at that time Should not be played Should not be played But according to my character I have to do my best to stand on the field. So I played anesthesia on my back. Swallowing a large pile of painkillers This is what happened before that game. [Williams] Manchester City with Mancheng Gold Built the team When we beat them I think everyone present is thinking "God, we really want to win." But you don't even dare to think about it. So close, at your fingertips We gasp in the city Hey, we have to win the league title. For Liverpool, the decisive moment has arrived. If they can successfully complete the task Waiting for the Red Army fighter is the call of fate Today Chelsea and Mourinho came here. English Premier League Liverpool vs Chelsea April 27, 2014 What kind of hospitality is this? What kind of atmosphere? Even at this football club Unique and brilliant history This can also be considered a major occasion. Anfield's sentiment Anfield is full of expectations Can Liverpool be like So many games this season Bring good news to them. Crossing the front is Chelsea Heading towards Kop stand attack Sterling catches the ball Good pass Johnson joined the battle Bypassing the pass behind Coutinho He tried it, but unfortunately... Salah’s ball is too far away from him to catch up. Mourinho picked up the ball Gerard and Flanagan both ran over Almost grabbed the ball from Mourinho’s palm. It’s a fool, it’s a fool. The first half is coming to an end Overtime 3 minutes Coutinho passed to the middle arc Liverpool crosses the midfield line To Saco Ah, Gerrard slipped. Deng Baba got the ball Form one-on-one with Miniolet Durban's goal Chelsea lead Liverpool 0-1 Chelsea Captain Steven Gerrard slipped Denpaba came out Score another key goal for Chelsea Chelsea leads in Anfield Among all the people, it is Gerrard... Chelsea's Denbba wears the goalkeeper to score - It’s Gerard’s mistake. Liverpool 0-1 behind [Williams] I can still be in my mind now. Depicting the moment, the end of the season Torres enters the restricted area Facing the old club... Final whistle This is a bad day for Liverpool. Is Mourinho... [Williams] lost to Manchester City in the league fight Heartbreaking, still But this is the essence of football That's why it is important to you Can think of Because that moment slipped that moment Among all people He will only blame himself That is really cruel. [wife Alex] When the ball entered I saw him looking up at the sky I thought, "God is coming. "He will be heartbroken" He is really heartbroken He just doesn't talk I can't say anything that will make him slow down. No one can do it English Premier League Crystal Palace vs Liverpool May 5, 2014 [Coach Macquarie] Everyone has a dream But football is a cruel sport. Go to Liverpool now. Will never be the same again Because the 8th is gone The end of an era 695 games 180 goals 10 trophies a Gerard Have you seen the report, do you know the reaction from the outside world? [Gerard] I can’t do it now. I keep switching TV channels. I have a reply to the message or something. But this is very difficult Can be with my idol role models Those club legends Comparable It feels good Especially... to my dad And my brother said You have mood swings and you should After all, this club Forms such an important part of your life But you are also all of us All our fans An inseparable part of life Yes, such a strong bond Can have such a love I am really one of the luckiest people in the world. Lift your scarf now Welcome your captain to step on the pasture Played his last game at Anfield Ladies and gentlemen Unique Steven Gerard! English Premier League Liverpool vs Crystal Palace May 16, 2015 [Mourinho] I want to take him to Chelsea. I want to bring him to Inter I want to bring him to Real Madrid. From beginning to end, he is still the dear enemy. So I pay tribute to him. Because at the end I think he has an outstanding football career. Have deep feelings with his people He refused the invitation of other big clubs. Only loyal to Liverpool I think this feeling Will last forever ♪Steve Gerard Gerard He has a long pass and 40 yards. He is strong and cold. ♪Steve Gerard Gerard [Gerard] This is the toughest thing I have ever done. Leave this club Until now, leaving me still hurts me. But I only come out from such a stressful environment. Fair to my family Staying here gave me a chance to breathe smoothly End my career with a smile on my face I play football, I hope. People can be proud of my efforts I think I did it. [Father Paul] When he left Liverpool he told me "Dad, I have contributed. All I can pay for" I said, "You don't need to tell me. I have seen it with my eyes." [Williams] can witness him kicking the ball I feel very honored Although in many ways people will think Steven Gerard Achievements in my career Can't be commensurate with his talents I think he has to accept this. But what he has And only a handful of players have it. Is the people of the city where he was born His deep love and respect Just like many people in this city He is an emotional person So he belongs to that kind of "I feel better than what I can win." The kind of person I can earn something more important elsewhere. And this is a great creed [Gerard] I enjoyed an extraordinary journey. I have had my highlight moment But I still have an unfinished business. I still want to return I often say to myself "Why are you going back to the pressure? Why are you going to experience? The ups and downs of those emotions" But I think my journey is not over yet. Let us wait and see thanks for watching By Dad does not have a water dog subtitle group
