Ladies! Break's over. Elsa Cartwright, I'm not paying you to hit golf balls. I want you to deliver these to the golf teams of every elite private school in New England. Outsiders? Hardly. This year's junior tournament parent coordinator thought it would be a strategic move to recruit new members. Doling out invites like CVS coupons. Just do as I say, Petey Varga. See you on the green. Wait, wait. Delivery, wait. Wait wait wait. Hold on, hold on, hold on. I'm looking for the school's golf teams. The JV and varsity. It's the summer. There's a driving range two miles west. I think the kids practice there. Kid's got a bright future, unlike me. Can I help you? Invitations to Butlerbrick Golf and Country Club's junior tournament. Old elitist institution getting desperate, huh? Elsa Cartwright? From the Connecticut Cartwrights? That's right, ma'am. Well, these kids only practice here when school's in session. Right, summer. Who knew? Actually, there is another Elsa Cartwright that's working a summer job here for me. Of course, not a Connecticut Cartwright, more of like a cleaning crew Cartwright. But she's still a pretty good golfer. Here, how about I give these to their parents? You're my type of woman, ma'am. Excuse me, I have a meeting. Reception, please hold. Back. Else, I'm concerned you're taking out your frustration on Mom's golf clubs. They're practically heirlooms. No, they're hand-me-downs. If they were worth anything, I would have sold them already. They were Mom's. That's gotta count for something. I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like that. Oh, one second. Reception, please hold. Here. I don't know, I guess I'm just upset about Dad being laid off. College and getting a job is just so far out of reach now. I just don't wanna end up like everyone else around here. Who works in construction or does hair. Weird. Weird? It's humiliating. You really want student debt, or like a useless college degree and still be living at home. I'm having a midlife crisis. Ugh! Reception, please hold. You know, I called three times already. Well, I am sorry you've called three times today, but we are very busy. Back. My life is literally in the shitter. Hey, everyone shits, even rich people. Miss Cartwright. Tina, I found these in the store. You know you're not supposed to sell your designs here. But look how cute they are. Tina. Please, Margery. Tina, the women that come in here, they want labels. They want brand names. They wanna wear what their friends are wearing. All right, I've tried to sell other stuff in here before. It doesn't sell. I am sorry. All right, look at it like this. You walk into a grocery store. You need some cat food. I don't have a cat. We have a dog. Fine, you need dog food. They have some Purina, they have some Blue Ribbon. But then, look, on the shelf, sitting in a plastic bag, is some bootleg dog food. What are you gonna choose? The plastic bag if it was in my price range. Duh. The point is, labels aren't just for show. They show what's inside. Now don't let me find these here again, or you'll be out of a job. This is a summer job, and Labor Day is this weekend. Well in that case, you'll be out of a reference. Now take your freaking designs. Get outta here. Come on. Else. Better not see these again. The tournament has been generously underwritten, and juniors will receive a cash prize of $15,000. $15,000? Yeah. I think that's pretty normal. Haven't you heard people at the driving range talk about their private clubs? Aw, did you miss us? It's a sign. Seriously. You've been stressing about college all summer. Now you can win your tuition. It's a coincidence for sure. You know what Dad says about coincidences. They're for people who don't believe in destiny. How did this happen? Doesn't matter. You have to go. No, I'm sure there's an entry fee, and they probably charge a lot to stay there. I'm sure we can afford like one night, between the two of us. I mean, I have savings from the summer, don't you? What's in this for you? I could make us some cute clothes, and then maybe the people at the club woulda wanna wear them. Our savings is money that could go to Dad, to-- To what? It's not even enough for like a semester of community college. Oh wow. I'm in. When Butlerbrick Golf and Country Club opened its doors in 1924, it became an instant-- Scene 101, Take 38. When Butlerbrick Golf and Country Club opened its doors in 1913, it became an instantaneous hot spot, for golf enthusiasts and swinging socialites. Ah, sorry, I gotta start again. Seasons have changed. Fortunes have fallen. But Butlerbrick has remained a place of community for those wealthy enough to afford one. Hello, I'm Victor Simmons, and for four generations, my family has made it a priority to create a welcoming home for the elite. Cut. I can see you. Are you sure this thing doesn't work? Unfortunately, no, ma'am. I need you to get down lower. You have to get lower. Lower. You know what, forget it, you're done. You're cut. Let's go. Did you deliver the invitations? It's all taken care of, sir. I've got a commercial to run. And we're rolling again. Consider Butlerbrick the next time you feel unimportant. You have money. You are important. Nurse, tell Pilot to turn on the heat seaters. Heat-- Seat heaters? In the heli. There's somewhere that I need to be. Come on. Let's go. Perfect. Go. Aunt Janet says hi, Dad. You have arrived. I love you. - Bye. - Bye. Okay, ready? Whoa, Kenny! Next time, may I suggest you walk? He was rude. There's only up from here, sir. This is humiliating. Let's just try and forget last year's debacle. Forget? How can I forget when my name is ranked dead last? It's like you trying to forget you were born a caddy when you're scrambling for stray golf balls. I wasn't born a caddy. I'm sorry, okay. It's hard to be political correct when you're feeling lightheaded. Are you hungry? Am I having a heart attack? Ow, Ow Roger? Do you need a snack? Nuts or trail mix? Nuts. Excellent choice, sir. Who's Cartwright? Who? Number three. I nearly won last year. I should be on top of Northfield. Always thought you'd be a bottom. Mm, make out. Northfield, didn't see you coming. That's sexy. Stop fannying. Who's Cartwright? I'm not fannying. You're the one fannying while faffing. I'm not faffing. Who is Cartwright? You don't know the infamous Cartwright of the Connecticut Cartwrights? Oh, the Connecticut Cartwrights. Why didn't you just say so? Overheard Simmons discussing the news story at brunch. Arg, matey. But he didn't even play last year. How can he be third? Ah, last year. Well, when one player drives their golf cart into the lake when they're about to clinch the tournament, just how much competition is there? Aw, fudge. How dare you bring up my incident? I nearly drowned. I had to spend a week in the spa sauna after the lake leech. I'll never understand why Lumer wasn't driving. Why would you drive your own golf cart, bro? Ah! Granny Lynn. So she's back, eh? Speaking of unfair. She's an 83-year-old woman who only golfs with her right hand. The odds are really stacked against you, Kowalski. The rules say 18 and under, so you'd see why I'd be upset. Admit that you suck at golf. Maybe I like sucking. Ah. Hi, excuse me. Could you point us to tournament check-in? Yeah. Hello there, fair maiden. Not interrupting at all. In the foyer. I can walk you there if need be. I'm Roger. My mommy is underwriting the tournament prize. To avoid scandal, he's number eight on the board. See number eight, Kowalski, at the bottom. And I'm number one, Bernard Northfield. And these are our caddies, but they're unimportant. Hi, Lumer. Oh, hi, I'm Tina. I'm Elsa, Cartwright. Cartwright. You're ranking number three, Cartwright. Oh, cool. Pre-rankings, that's a lotta pressure for a junior golf game, isn't it? Thank you. See, that's what I've been trying to tell you. See? Doesn't mean anything. I'd rather be ranked last night than not ranked at all, caddy. Well, your dreams came true. Shut up. Well it's nice to meet you guys. Yeah, thank you. Cool, okay. I will follow you on Instagram. Follow her on Instagram? I'll follow her into Chernobyl. Wait up. What's Chernobyl? Enjoy nut munching. Maybe I will. Yeah, it's tasty. Gunter! - I'll take this. - Thank you. Marshal. Thanks. Oh! What the hell, dude? Did it hurt, when you fell from heaven? You just slammed a door in my face, so yeah, it hurt. I panicked. You look exactly like my future ex-wife. I'm Marshal, Mayson. Hi. The Fifth. Okay, I'm Tina Cartwright. Of the Connecticut Cartwrights? Yeah, I am from Connecticut. Aren't you gonna apologize? For what? Bashing my nose in. Uh, I kinda did you a favor, because now the ladies at the Junior League don't have to talk when you get that nose job. Are you saying my nose is big? I'm not not saying it's big. Say you're sorry. I'm not sorry we met. And I'm not wearing any underwear. Again, have we met? I'm Marshal Mayson V Right through here. Oh, just one waiter? Oh, it's Winston. He's very efficient. Ah, ladies, meet Ms. Lynn. She's just returned from a lengthy hiatus. It's Granny Lynn to you dears. May I present Elsa Cartwright of the Connecticut Cartwrights. I don't think so. Hm? I said I don't think this is Elsa Cartwright of the Connecticut Cartwrights. Oh. Elsa grandmother's was one of my closest friends. Diana Cartwright, and I saw Elsa many times. The most recent time being at her grandmother's funeral. Uh. Yes, I remember you. I probably look a little different. I've been working all summer. Working? Oh, oh, you mean with your charity work. Yes, my charity work. What a summer can do when you're 17. Well , wait a minute. Your shoulders should be covered in a club, young lady. Okay. I can't believe I forgot a cardigan. More importantly, who the fuck are these Connecticut Cartwrights? Okay, I found it. Diana Cartwright's obituary is in Vanity Fair. Oh my God. They're like some kind of American dynasty. Oh my God. Get this. She is survived by her parakeet, Wendell, to whom a sizable trust fund has been left. Nice. Guess there is more than one Elsa Cartwright in Connecticut. So she goes to the Daft School. Ugh. And she golfs at the driving range during the school year. So, should we unpack? I think we should make a run for it. We already made it this far. Everyone here knows these people. They're gonna realize I'm not her. They know of them. But only that old lady like actually knows them, and you already fooled her. Come on. You're both, I don't know, brunettes. Oh my God, wait. No, look, look, look, look. Says she's gone for the summer. No having cellphones out on club property, Rule 78. Heed my warning. Ladies. Hi, would you like to join me at lunch? - Oh, no. - We'd love to. - We can't impose. - Yes, no. We'd love, yes. No no, no no, hey, it's on me. It's on Daddy, but it will be fun. Follow me, ha ha. Here you are. Thank you. Lumer, sit. Oh yes, hotdogs. That was fast. Roger's family are gold status members. They've been here for years. Dig in. What is this? Cheers. Roger, can I ask you a question? - Why? - Oh. God. Unfortunate turn of events. Caddy, wand me. It's fine. Thank you. Allow me. The White's Wand. Gets anything out like magic. You just apply a little bit to your, um, to your chest area. To your breasts, your boobs. - Got it. - Okay, sorry. Oh, first you actually need to apply some water, oh! Oh my God. Okay, there I go again, ha ha. Mr. Klutz. Olé! Sorry. Smoothly executed, sir. I feel flushed. I think you're just embarrassed. Are you okay? Feel my forehead. You're fine. I'm not fine. I think I have a fever. He's got a panic disorder. He doesn't look good. No, that's mild. Can I ask you a question? Winston? Sir? Grab me a fresh wiener for Elsa. Actually I should probably go see if Elsa's okay, so Winston, will you just send it up? Thanks. Roger, my man, whatever you guys are doing over here, you need to chill it out, okay? Especially you. Hey! You had your hat on. I thought you were leaving. I always have my hat on. He knows I don't take off my hat. He's an asshole. Oh my God, what the H? What is going on with these people? Mommy says to never let anybody see the top of my head because of my genetic predisposition for early onset - Male pattern baldness. - Male pattern baldness. I had an inquiry for you, Roger. Will you give me a call? Can't really use my cellphone on club premises. That's why she's giving you her number, in case you go to the cellphone room. No thanks. Um, give me a call? Yeah. Thank God. What? - Huh? - What? You heard her. She said can I ask you a question? That's premier I'm about to ask you out intro. Is that what she was doing? Caddy, leave the social science to me. There's a reason some of us are born caddies. Please tell me you know I wasn't born a caddy. What? Tina just gave me a great idea. I will ask out Elsa. So you're gonna reject Tina and then ask out her sister? Hm, I know you are but a humble caddy and have much to learn in this world, but the best way to win a tournament, as an athlete, is to focus on distracting the competition. If Elsa is worried about me, she will not have any time to think about golf. What about we focus on your drives? Instead of, like, all this nonsense. - Winston. - Sir? I will be taking this. Thank you. I can't, sir. I will deliver it, Winston. That's very fine. I have my orders, sir. Winston, let go of the box. No, sir, I have my orders. I will deliver it, Winston. You cannot take it. Winston, let go of the box. Give it to me! I can't, sir. A bag, sir? That will not be necessary. Thank you, Winston, lead me out. Very good, sir. Just go a little bit faster. I can't go any faster, sir. I tried to ask Roger if he would model for my clothing line, but he got like violently ill. Will you ask him? I don't think he likes me. Why Roger? Have you seen his all-pink ensemble? He's clearly into fashion. Isn't it a woman's sports line? Gender is a construct. Look, tennis rackets. Oh, Elsa. At your service. Thank you. Oh, a note. Oh, what? What's it say? Elsa, will you go to the junior tournament celebrational formal with me, kisses, Roger? My mommy's organizing it. When is it? Post-tournament, that evening. Okay, sure. Thanks, Roger. Awesome sauce. Also, will you be my girlfriend? Uh, wow. Okay. Okay, well. Okay, you'll be my girlfriend? Okay. Okay, I have girlfriend. Okay. Okay. - Bye. - Bye. Bye. Thought I was gonna sneeze. Okay, bye. Make it rain! Love 30. Send it! Are you queefing serious? Love 40. Fuck yeah! Ow! You got me in the boob. Game. My new girlfriend asked me to model, so model I will. Hello, Mr. New Booty. You're in too deep. Then don't come. You'll see. The fish has already eaten the hook hidden inside me. The juicy bait. I know exactly what to get you. Okay. He looks good. I mean Roger is a great dresser. Mm-hm. - Cheers. - Cheers. I'll be right back, okay? O-kay. Hey. Looks like we're playing together. Elsa's the golfer. Looks like we're playing together. Look, it's not too late to just call it off. Get some sleep. Lumer, ever since my daddy had to take up residence in Antigua for chasing the American dream, sans taxes, I haven't quite been myself. Sir-- Oh oh oh, don't interrupt. My daddy always said to me, to be successful, to be this successful, you can't be honest. And that applies to sports, life, whatever you can win at. All right, Marshal seems to be Mr. Steal Yo Girl right now. Mr. Steal My What? Hello! Shoo. - Bye. - Bye. You couldn't have picked a better guy for the job. Roger loves his outfits. Who, Marshal? That guy smells like shit. Yeah. How are you, um, how are you doing? So how's your sister feeling about, about the game? And you also like television? Cool. Hello. Hey. May I interest you in a secret handshake, as my girlfriend? Sure. This could be the boyfriend-girlfriend handshake. Slide. Pound, not like that. That's pretty good. And a little peace sign, and we're boyfriend girlfriend. No, I think I'll just sleep in the nude. I think you made the right decision. I regret it. Give me the chemise. I meant coming back here. Why don't we go down and have a drink with Winston? Oh no, I'm not ready to face Winston yet. You know what's funny? Even though I'm not a model or anything, I've always kind of been immersed in like the competitive world of fashion. Like, my mommy's always told me that you can tell how much money somebody has based off their handbag and stuff like that. Like, my greatest accessory would be, like Lumer, because I don't have a handbag. On second thought, I'm not sure that the beret is working. But if Lumer was a handbag, he'd probably-- Could you take it off, maybe? Oh no, I think it brings some worldliness to this whole thing. A little bit of parlez-vous Francais. Well, maybe, let's see. Yeah, let's do this. Can you just tie this around your waist, and maybe lose the scarf? Oh, I see what you ladies are doing. Wanna see the goodies. You got it. Did you hear that? Some power poses. Got it. Just like confident stuff. Totally. But you, Roger you. The beauty within? Like Vince Vaughn. Not like Vince Vaughn. Maybe somebody like Steve-O. You can't handle the truth. Something like that. No, I think it's the beret. What? Can we just lose it? - No, no no no. - Please. - Please. - No no, no no. Okay, bring it in. What's up? Okay, so you know how you were saying that Lumer is like an accessory, right? Yeah, he's super nice, right. But that's like, that's kind of it, you know. Some accessories, they enhance us, and others, they just, they keep us from shining on our own, right? - Mm. - Hm-mm? Mm-hm. You don't need Lumer, just like you don't need that beret. Come on, we'll do it together, okay? This one is for Vince. Toss that old thing aside. Let me see the cardigan. Come on. Come on. Come on, yes! Yes, yes! Perfect, that was great. What the hell is going on out here? Oh no. Not again. Put up your hands and step away from the flagpole please. Come on, over here. Jesus, Roger, ow! Freeze. I'm just gonna head out, too. Ah. For God sake, Roger, what the hell are you doing? Just chilling. No you're not. Get up. Tired, long day. Just taking a nap, buddy. Come on, let's go, up. Just don't. Oh. Oh! Roger. What was that? Was there an animal? I think there's an animal behind me. A muddy animal. Hello. What's up, Mr. Simmons? This is not what it looks like. Looks like you're flouncing around for the camera. God, you're smart. That's exactly what this is. Here I am, trying to sleep, and I can't get a wink because you hooligans are traipsing around in my beautifully manicured grounds. You think this is some sort of Midwestern putt-putt fun center? This golf course costs more than your life. Fine, I'll take full responsibility. It was Tina's idea. Yeah, you think I don't know that you don't have the wherewithal to orchestrate anything? Go lick your wounds, elsewhere. Miss Cartwright? What are you doing here? Are you practicing? - Yes. - At midnight? Yes. Well, big day tomorrow, ha ha. You done? - Yes. - Okay. You feeling good? It's very important. Everything's riding on this. No, I'm kidding. Everything's not riding on it, but it is important. Ugh. What did you do to poor Roger? We were doing a photo shoot. With Roger? What, are you jealous? Maybe, a little bit. Come here, I wanna show you something. Oh, and get this. She asked to remove the beret. Yeah, I lost it. That's unlike you. Ugh, I know. I was pooping everywhere. Ooh, boy. Oh my God. 200 calories left on my dieting app for today. Oh, two taquitos, please. One and a half. Guess I shouldn't be eating this late? Lumer, phone. Lumer, phone. Hello, Lumer, phone! Lumer. Hello. Hello. Daddy? How's Antigua? What? Hey, I meant to talk to you about something, but I forget exactly. What it was. Coming in? It's warm. I don't think so. How are you liking Butlerbrick? I love it. You love it? Nobody loves Butlerbrick. It's iconic. It's iconic? Maybe the golf tournament. There's like 10 people signed up for the junior tournament. Not the junior tournament. The junior tournament sucks. Really? The junior tournament's just there to get new families in, you know, new blood with old money like Granny Lynn money. What is the deal with Granny Lynn? Like, what's with the fur? The fur, she's a legend. It's 80 degrees outside. She's a legend. She can wear fur in the summer if she wants. She's got all that cheese money, you know. What? She's a cheese heiress. I mean, her family literally made their money on the backs of smoked Gouda and Parmesan. Are you serious? I'm serious. She used to come out here every summer, like a thousand different WASPS, and they'd just party and rage, and then she stopped coming for some reason and they all stopped coming too. Now they all gather in Westhampton every summer. - Westhampton? - Yeah, right. Not even a real Hampton. Can you help me out? I wasn't born yesterday. I'm freezing. Can you just help me out? No. I'm not gonna pull you in. Promise? Yeah, totally. Please. - Good. - Thank you. I lied, sorry. Aren't you glad you got in, though? It's warm, right? I pretty much knew that was gonna happen. Oh, you knew that was gonna happen? Mm-hm. Did you? Are you a psychic or something? Do you have ESP? I was hoping for some hedge fund new money, some Democrats. Why? Because otherwise you wouldn't be here. You don't know anything about me. I know you're not a Connecticut Cartwright. I was kicked out of the Daft School. Where you going? Your secret's safe with me. Come in. Why can't I work up the courage to say hello to Winston? Truthfully, it was so wonderful to catch a glimpse of him at lunch. Mm. Even though he got that gut now. Oh, I wonder what he would think of me. Uh-huh, Nurse, are you there? Oh. My apologies, Madame. Oh, shut the door, man. Least you got the one good hand. No! All right. Thank you, it's a beautiful day. Very excited, just a few announcements. Due to last year's incident involving an unidentified member who will not be named, all caddies have been equipped with a life jacket, should this function be necessary. Woo! What happened, with the life vest? Players have been paired by starting rank, so number one with number two and so on. Excuse me, is this really fiscally responsible? Why should we all have the burden of extra weight when only some of us are incompetent? Who cares if you're incompetent? As long as you're not impotent. Excellent motto, Granny Lynn. Boop, boop. And due to a different biohazard incident involving the same unidentified member, we will not be playing hole four. Play hole five twice. I guess that's my bad. Please stay hydrated. We have beverages courtesy of the Northfield family. Ugh. Woo-hoo. Thank you, okay. Jesus, what's up your butt? There's been nothing in my butt for weeks. All right. The diarrhea was a psychosomatic issue. Thanks. Caddy! I don't know if this is a competition thing, because you're being really rude. Just trying to do my job, Tina. You know, be the best accessory that I could be. How's that working out? Lumer, move your bootay souffle. Let the games begin. I know you're not supposed to ask a woman for her age, but, uh, are you in college? You see, I'm 14 trying to take applications - for a little side piece thing. - His mom knows my mom. Sorry. Think about it. Keep your puppy on a leash. You tapping that tonight? Roger and Elsa? Yeah, I thought Elsa was dating her sister. Gunter, I'm teeing off. It's a conflict of interest. I mean, there has to be something in the rules about dating the competition. Take a crack, young'un. Lick my crack, old man. Well. Duck hook. Quack, quack. No caddy, Mary-Anne? Isn't that what golf carts are for? I thought at least my mom would show. Should I go first? Whatever, Mary-Anne. Free country. Will you tee off for me? She's right there. She will see us. Oh my God, I hate Mary-Anne so much. I can hear you. Good. Then do you mind if Lumer tees off for me? What do I get in return? Whatever you want. Tee for two? Oh, that's perfect. That's actually a really good idea. There you go, buddy. You love golf, yay. Stay humble. And always move forward. All right, you got it. Remember, eye on the prize. Playing the fifth hole twice is getting crowded. Yeah. I like her butt when she putt. Not looking too fierce. Hey, I made this. The competition. You a good golfer? Yeah, you? I'm good, just not like, interested in getting better. One, two, three. Three, three. - Three. - Three. Yeah. - Bravo. Bravo. Is it snack time yet? God help me. I will turn this cart around. - Please. - Please. I'm the only one doing any golfing here. Not that anybody would know. Because nobody's here, and nobody cares. I care. I really don't care if you care, Mary-Anne. Okay, fine then, I don't care. Fine, that's great. Fine. I'm glad we agree. Why are you so mean about it? I'm not being mean. I'm just hungry. Carbs or fruit? Fruit. Yay, thanks. Can I have some? Yeah. Good luck, buddy. Whoa ho ho, nice job. I guess you don't miss 100% of the shots you don't take. What the hell? That was funny. Hey, good job. That was good stuff. Woo! Trade? Wait, what? You golfed better for Roger than for me? Nice, take that, Northfield. You know what? I quit. Wait, Mary-Anne, Mary-Anne. I just golfed 18 holes for you. Whatever, Lumer. What does that mean? It means lunch. Let's go to lunch. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Ho ho ho! You look rough. Not as rough as hole four after you pooped on it. You guys were supposed to play hole five twice. There's nothing wrong with a round two. Slut. All right, enough. I have to go. What, go poo-poo? At least I have a real caddy. Everybody knows Gunter here doesn't even belong to this country club. Roger, can we go to lunch? Caddy, I'm trying to make a point. You see, I have a real-life caddy. One that was born a caddy. I wasn't born a caddy. Lumer, chill. Look, man, I just golfed 18 holes for you and 18 holes for Mary-Anne, and you don't care. I'm exhausted. And I heard you agree with Tina. I'm just an accessory, so, you know what, man? If I'm that disposable to you, then good luck without me. What are you doing? I know a better way to get wet. Leaving the luncheon already? Yeah, you'll learn that country club food is not the best. Meeting some friends for lunch. Your, uh, your Uber's here. That's my driver. See ya. Yep. Hey, I tried texting you, but that tween took my phone for not being in a cellphone room. I wouldn't have been able to answer anyways, unless I was also in a cellphone room. So. Okay, that doesn't make any sense. I mean, doesn't that mean we'll just end up having a face-to-face conversation? I think that's sort of the point. Hey, I wanted to say I'm sorry. I didn't mean all that stuff about you being an accessory. I don't think that about you. I'm starving. Do you wanna? No, I'll see you in there. Roger's driving me absolutely crazy, so I'm gonna take a five. Take a five, and take a 10. Okay, see you there. Okay, sweet. - Okay. - All right, yeah. What the hell am I doing? Hello, Mommy. Didn't see you at the tournament today. Oh, traffic from Southampton was horrid. Why can't I stay in Southampton? Darling, you know, I told you. The Winthrops have so many guests already this summer. But don't worry, we'll be back in our own home just as soon as your father's name is cleared. Mm-mm. Now, I want you to make a good impression, mmkay? Because we don't exactly have the highest reputation right now. I also want you to be a good boy, and to help string some of the lanterns along the table, Roger! And then, I want you to help the servers to light the, oh, the purple ones. To light the food troughs. Thanks for asking how the tournament's going. Not! Okay. Hello. Ooh. Hi, for those of you who don't know me, I'm Frances Kowalski, but you may call me Fanny. As the parent coordinator for this year's Labor Day junior golf tournament-- It makes me and my son Roger so happy to have a sense of community. Myself and Roger appreciate community so much. Right now. Everyone knows my son Roger, right? - Hello. - Hello. One sec. To community. - To community. - Community. Oh no, don't toast with water, it's bad luck. Cheers. Cheers, too. Hello. How are you doing? One sec. You still there? Daddy! How's the big tournament going? It's um. It's going well, I hope. It's uh, it's going. What's wrong? Roger? Betrayal. Hello! I'd like to make a toast too, as well. Roger, honey, come sit down. Not now, boy. Yes, now, boy. My own mommy, Frances Kowalski, is so obsessed with having everything all-- Are you listening? Why are you eating? My mommy, right there, is so obsessed with having it all figured out, doing everything for herself, that she's abandoned me. That is not true. We still have a staff in the city. Cheers to being a terrible mommy, Mommy. Roger? Is this because you're not winning? How would you even know? You haven't even been to the tournament. Roger, Fanny's been a part of it. - She was at Elsa's first-hole tee-off. - Well-- What the H? Roger. Are you H'ing me? Oh my A. Traitor, traitor. Please. You too, old man. Hey. Traitor. Roger. Do you feel better now? You're a traitor! Roger, that's enough. All right, Roger, that's enough. I'm gonna set myself on fire. - Okay. - Settle down. Roger. God, I'm gonna do it! I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna set myself on fire! Ah! There's a snake. Ow, ow! Ow, I'm suffocating. I don't like it. This is it for me. Bye. What a wonderful performance, so passionate. Everyone, go back to your lunch. Bravo, bravo. He's high-strung. No, somebody's in there. Why don't you have a seat? All right, very good. What about the tournament? Excuse me, I'm looking for Elsa Cartwright. And who are you? I'm Elsa Cartwright. Someone here is pretending to be me. Roger Kowalski? He tagged me in a picture on Instagram with the caption, Love at First Sight. My beautiful girlfriend Elsa Cartwright of the Connecticut Cartwrights. I was giving a bath to a rescue goat when I got the notification. Obviously, this is not me. What she said is true. Well, my name is also Elsa Cartwright, but I pretended to be you. I did it because I don't have any money for college. I work at a driving range in New Haven, and your invitation was sent there, so I thought it was for me. I thought this was my chance. That I wouldn't be judged by my clothes or by my neighborhood, but by my skill as a golfer. By the time I realized it was a mistake, I couldn't walk away. I'm sorry. I for one think you should stay, and finish the remainder of the tournament. I'm sorry, no. You're obviously a wannabe. Well, what's Labor Day out east without a little scandal, right? Whose side are you on? Yours. I just, I thought your family was known for their charity. Oh. What have I told you about serving minors, Winston? Oh, posh. I was crawling myself out of a barrel of Guinness before I had my first pubic hair. You were a good time back then, Winston. Oh, Winston. I came back here looking for excitement. But just now when that Kowalski boy almost set himself on fire ... Hello. I realized that the only excitement I ever really missed was you. I've never been one for monotony, monot-- Monogamy. Same thing. I should have done this long ago. - One. - One. - Two. - Two. - Three. - Three. Yeah. Winston, will you marry me? Oh. Hey, what's going on? I have good news, Cartwrights from Connecticut. You guys can stay. Yeah, I talked to the other Elsa and I told her the only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about. And that works? Yes, that and I offered to show her around. You're welcome, you little troublemakers. I'll catch up with you. Hey, you okay? Lumer has resigned. The storm is passing. How am I gonna get myself dressed for the tournament? Yeah, you can't go out in that bathrobe. It's too Harvey Weinstein. Okay, don't worry. Let's see. Look! Hey. Macaw! Granny Lynn? No Service! What are you doing here? Texting you. What are you doing here? Yeah, I was gonna text you. Oh, really? What did you wanna say? Yeah, some girl, she commented on Roger's post, that she's coming here. Oh yeah, that actually already happened. Times at Butlerbrick move fast, so, keep up. Cool. So you're like not getting thrown out? Sweet. What did you, what did you wanna say to me? You wanted-- Oh you to, to you. Those are tough. Ladies and gentlemen, the homestretch. A few contenders have forfeited. Mary-Anne Montreal and Marshal Mayson. Also Granny Mary Lynn, who asked me to read her official statement, and I quote. "I felt bad crushing the juniors in their baby competition." Look, I know that was super quick, I just-- It's been like a like a long time. Can you help me with something? Roger's returns closet. Oh my God. Whenever he buys something he doesn't like or it's like the wrong size, he acts like he's gonna return it, but inevitably waits too long, throws it in here and pretends like it never happened. It's been such a long summer. For a second, Roger got really into wakeboarding. Can't imagine he'd be very good at that. He realized that as soon as he got into the boat. Wand me. And now for the dark horse of the tournament, Ms. Cartwright. That was a major mistake for young Cartwright. She's gonna have to hit a three-wood here. She's hitting a driver off the deck. Ugh, did anybody else get a whiff of that whiff? Terrible. One more try for Miss Cartwright. Just as I thought, southwesterly. My mistake, it's just westerly. Coincidentally, this is the same position Mr. Kowalski held at this time as he was about to clinch last year's tournament, and we all know how that ended. There's grass on the ball, ha ha. Okay, here we go, woo! Lumer! You came back. Mr. Kowalski, please clear the premises, so we can continue the tournament. Lumer, Lumer, something grave has happened. Take me to the pool house. Wait, Lumer. Sorry I hurt your feelings. You're my best friend. I'm your only friend. Onward. Oh. Daddy? Oh. Wheel me away. Hey, no! Oh my God. Whoa. That was literally my family, like all the little ice coffee shit that like hipsters drink-- Is somebody coming? My grandpa invented that. It's crazy. I promise. This is not a morgue. What are they doing? This is my spot. Oh, we were just leaving. Just looking for, um, decorations for a junior formal. Yeah, I put the decorations outside because Simmons kept walking in on me. Oh sweet, well, that makes sense. Do you wanna, let's head out? We'll head out back, okay? Cool. Bye. Thank you so much. I love you all, thank you. Do as I say, Petey. Victor Simmons. Hidden in plain sight, bastard. You have to tell your mom. Oh my God, he's calling me. Don't answer it. Stop. That's good. Oh shoot. Will you go get that for me? I didn't back it up. Thank you, buddy. Next up, Ms. Cartwright. Can she eagle this hole and win, or will the rains continue to get the better of her? I hate him. No, no no no no no no. I married wrong. Roger, honey, your father has always been a sociopath. I mean, he was wild and handsome. But he was also off. It was part of his charm. He strangled a ferret to death at his fraternity when he was in college, for no reason. They got it as a mascot, and then it ended up being too much work. Well the president said get rid of it, and he meant take it back to the pet store. But your father killed it, with his own bare hands. That shoulda been the first red flag. But I was in love. I thought, what's one ferret's life in the grand scheme of a relationship? Hm. I'm sorry I didn't come see you play. I was so busy keeping up appearances, putting on a good face. Your face looks fine. Mm, Botox. Mommy? Did you mean what you said when I was in the bathroom? No, somebody's in there. That somebody was in there? Somebody's in there. Do you really think I'm a somebody? Yes, dear. I think you're a somebody. Now, go get cleaned up. I'll take care of this pool house situation. Oh. There you are. Now congratulations. Excuse me. I'm the proprietor. Excuse me. Harboring a wanted criminal is a felony. Well, I know that. Let's go. What does that have to do with me? Is it hot in here, or is it just me? There's always next year. Too bad about last year. If only you hadn't driven your golf cart-- Your elitism shines. --into a lake. Who would do something that crazy? Someone in love, that's who. In love. I mean, people do crazy things for love, don't they? Like try and set themselves on fire. I'm gonna set myself on fire. Or hit themselves on the head with their own golf club. Point taken. So I thought to myself, who does Roger love? Then I realized, Roger loves golf. Then I remembered, oh, not, no. Lumer does all the brunt work. So then I thought, well, Roger must love Cartwright. I love my girlfriend very much. May I interest you in a secret handshake? But then, I remembered, your girlfriend wasn't around last year. Was she? She was busy. Yeah. And then it hit me. Roger loves me. Maybe I like sucking. Are you in love with me, Roger Kowalski? You said you wanted to do this. I say a lot of things. Don't just stand there. Wash it off! Ah, crap. Oh, fudge. Hurry up. Hurry up. All you have are energy drinks. Oh, I don't drink water anymore. I'm trying to lose weight. Sir, these are loaded with sugar. You know that? Energy drinks are trendy, and trendy people are skinny. I don't want you to beat yourself up for it. Just stop making those mistakes, okay, buddy? Oh, shoot. Oh. Just use the White's Wand. We're gonna be good, I'm not scared. It didn't work. Aw, crap, we're crap outta luck. Get outta the way. What are you doing? Get out of the way. Get out of the way! Shocking. I hope he's okay. Feel my abs. Really? Go on, feel my abs. Gunter! I have a hard exterior, but I'm gooey underneath. My little lake leech. Oh, there they are. Bravo. Thank you for everything. What will happen to Butlerbrick? I will be taking over for my nephew. And how about you? What school have you set your sights on? Actually, I'd like to stay here, if you'd let me. As your golf pro. What about college? I was told if I didn't go to college I'd never amount to anything. But that's not true. And if you let me stay here, I can save this money doing what I love. The American dream. Congrats. You killed it. It was definitely the outfit. Lucy? Ladies, just a minute please. Ms. Cartwright here is going to be our new golf pro. So, perhaps a lesson? Sure, why not? You don't know this, but I actually took up golfing just to be near you. I was always so jealous. You're so much better than me. You finally admit it. I owe you an apology, Cartwright. You were just a casualty on the battlefield of love. It's okay, Roger. Friends? Friends. Proud of you. Thanks, but it's not the Super Bowl.
