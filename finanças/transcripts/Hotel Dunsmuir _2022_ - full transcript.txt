So you need to stop being silly 'cause you know exactly the way I want you at home. -[bacon sizzling] -[eerie music] [Luke] Come on now, sugar. You ain't gotta look that sad. Listen, when I'm out on a hunt, you can sneak out anything you wanna wear outta that closet, okay? Put it on. Wear it. Just as long as you ain't still wearing it when I get back here to my castle. We've been through this. Now, I love you. Get changed. [bacon sizzling] Yes, Daddy. -[eerie music] -[chimes jingling] [bacon crunching] Put some clothes on, girl. This ain't an exhibition show. -[ominous music] -[chimes jingling] [bacon sizzling] [hands slapping] You get the rest of that hog on some bread for me.

That's right. And this ain't all talk, a bunch of words. Your whole family, who I share a deep faith with, entrusted me with this honor. [ominous music continues] [sighs] Hmm. [Luke groans] [chimes jingling] [floor creaking] [frame clacks] Your whole family, except one. Sack of shit you call "Grandma". That's my nightstand! Don't touch it like that. That's my stuff. Don't touch it. Hey. Everyone knows she's evil. And I'm talking in the most classical sense of the term. She's right there with the devil. It was an accident. Okay?

And I told you, I ain't always going to feel the same way about you. I know, but just once I'd-- It's just a little something. Just a little something to help me remember you by. [ominous music] I get nervous being on tape recordings like that. No, it's just something to help me remember how I like you. The way you are, right now.

Saturday night. -[snaps fingers] -What you waiting on? Get to it, girl. Come on. -[upbeat rock music] -[customers chattering] [glasses clinking] So there we was, Billie and me this morning. I lift my field glasses up and I see the most... What's the word? [Ray] What have you been up to Billie? [Luke] Ripe! Ripe black bear and her cubs. Oh, I've been making dioramas mostly, Ray. -Inside of shoe boxes. -I'm telling you right now, the season can't get here fast enough. You know you can't harvest a mama bear and her cubs in this state. [scoffs] You glue little trees down? I didn't say that. What I said was, I can give two flying fucks about harvesting a female and her babies. Yeah, um, I make little trees. And animals. I like adding animals. Two shits, you mean. What? The expression is, "You don't give two shits." Flying fucks always come in ones. [men laugh] Do you make the animals yourself? You a stupid son of a bitch, you know that? Can you be any more fucking annoying? Huh? Shut up! Shut the fuck up sometimes! No, they're made out of plastic. I buy them. You need to shut up more. You need to shut up better. [men laugh] Well heck, that's still creative. What the hell is wrong with you, man? -Hey, hey, hey. -Yeah, I enjoy making dioramas, Ray. -[beer splashing] -Hey, hey, hey. -Watch it! -What the fuck, Luke? Can I ask you something, Billie? What the hell's your problem, man? -Hey, what the fuck? -Don't touch me! I thought we were just playing around. If you could live anywhere you want in the world, just snap your fingers. -Hey, Billie. -[snaps fingers] Billie, what you doing? [eerie music] Antarctica. -[orb buzzing] -Antarctica? Are you pulling my leg? I'd go somewhere tropical. -Billie, I'm talking to you. -[orb buzzing] [eerie music] Hey, Billie. [Luke] Billie. Look at me. Billie, snap the fuck out of it.

Fucking kidding me? [engine revving] Embarrass me in front of my friends like that. What the hell's wrong with you? [engine revving] Now the joke's on me. [slurping] And here I am thinking that you're doing so much better. Doing so good, but no. You slip right in to that bullshit again in public! -[engine revving] -[tires screeching] Fucking livid! [Luke slurping] Don't yell at me. Do you even believe in Jesus? [sighs] Shit. [engine revving] I'm just curious. I am not in the mood right now, okay? So don't you start with me. I just wonder sometimes, is your faith real in that church? [engine revving] Or you just making all that up to get in my pants? Shut up! Shut up! Keep your mouth shut. I'm done talking! That's it. Just fucking sit there. You need help. You need help. [scoffs] Shit. Shame on me. [exhales] -[chattering on TV] -[traffic whirring] [Man On TV] No, Cadence, I'm sorry. [birds and insects chirping] I'm not always so morbid. It's just that the, the funeral ceremony is today. [Woman On TV] It's a very beautiful pond. You know, this is all just exactly like I imagined Ireland would be. [Man On TV] It rained today at the funeral. We stood around her grave under black umbrellas. And then we threw flowers under her little headstone. -Mother looked at the flowers -[keyboard clacking] and then she collapsed. Every year it's been the same. The umbrellas, flowers, -and mother's collapse. -[mouse clicking] [Woman On TV] But that was years ago. Why do you keep having the same ceremony over and over again? [Man On TV] There's some things you don't understand. Not yet. Mother's probably waiting. I'll be in my workshop. [Woman on TV] I don't know. I think he's in the studio. He said he had a sudden inspiration. Something about wanting to finish his statute before... [Man] All right, Simon. I seen ya, come out of there now. I give up. You caught me fair and square. [soft piano music] -[eerie music] -[static crackling] -[eerie music continues] -[static crackling] [Billie gasping] [indistinct chatter on TV] [sportscaster on TV] ...And Harvey sends Bellevo away. Bellevo is down, over the line with Jeffreon. Bellevo shoots right on. And the rebound cleared by Bauer. Left wing pass to Olmsted. Knocked away from him by Jeffreon. Recovered for the Leafs. Clears the other side. Stewart playing it back in to Horton. Horton to Stanley. Stanley rolled it ahead to Milford... [mouse clicking] -[mouse clicking] -[suspenseful music] [mouse clicking] [Billie gasping] [Billie whimpering] [Billie breathes uneasily] [Billie gasping] -[Billie groaning] -[Luke breathes angrily] [head whacks] [Billie coughing] You never spy on a man's personal belongings. Do you hear me? Huh? You've been sharing those videos, you son of a bitch! You said they were private! If there's any more stupid, there's gonna be hell to pay! [head whacking] -[Billie groaning] -[Luke breathes heavily] -[body thuds] -Hey. Come on, get up. I said, get up! -[suspenseful music] -[chattering on TV] You see what you did? Shit. I didn't do anything. What the hell? What the hell you make me do? Huh? You did this. You did this! Next time, you mind your goddamn business! [sportscaster] The side of the net, into the corner on the boards, it's Olmsted back to the point to Stanley. He winds up for the shot. And it's kicked out over the line by Allegua. [breathes heavily] Okay. Set up for Toronto to attack. [Luke sniffs and sighs] Married couples fight all the time. Married couples fight all the time. I didn't do anything. Just gotta walk it off. [exhales] Just gonna walk it off. [chattering on TV] Gotta walk it off, boy. Come on. -[door sliding] -[insects chirping] [footsteps pattering] [suspenseful music] [sportscaster] In lieu of last year's Stanley Cup, so there seeing a lot of hockey out there tonight. And we hope that they are feeding you well. [eerie music] Face off to the left of Bauer. [Billie breathes heavily] [chattering on TV continues] [Billie groaning] [Billie breathes heavily] [Billie whimpering] [phone line ringing] Billie? -[Billie crying] -Oh my goodness. I hate him. I hate him so fucking much. Slow down, honey. What did he do? He's been showing our sex recordings to his friends. Then he choked me, I passed out. [cries] I knew it. That backwoods trash son of a bitch! I know, Maddy. I know. [cries] Where is he now, Billie? He's in his shop, I guess. You need to leave, hon. -Mmm. -You need to leave now. -Where am I gonna go? -Are his car keys there? -[suspenseful music] -[Billie breathes uneasily] Y-Yes. Grab those keys and go, Billie. You hear me? Grab those keys and drive to me. Get the hell out of there once and for all. This is it. You must leave. I might be the black sheep, but goddamn if he'll lay another hand on you as long as I'm alive. Okay. Okay. [breathes uneasily] You're driving to me, Billie, right this minute. Okay, Grandma. Okay, I'm coming. Do it, Billie. God bless you, do it. I love you, Grandma. [soft dramatic music] Wish me luck.

It's been announced that five thousand Indians in Guatemalan villages are about to be murdered. Guatemala, Guatemala, Guatemala. [suspenseful music] -[bell rings] -[soft orchestral music] [customers chattering] -[suspenseful music] -[eerie singing] Billie. What a surprise is, uh, is Luke with you? You know, I, I have been meaning to give that old dog a call. -Hank. -Yeah. -Hey. -Hi. -It's great to see you. -[Hank chuckles] Luke's outta the country right now. Yeah, yeah, I'm, I'm just on my way through to visit some family. Really? I, [chuckles] I, I do apologize. I'm, I'm not exactly dressed for company. Really, uh, I'm the one who should be apologizing. Here I am putting you on the spot in the middle of nowhere. Uh, listen, I'm, I'm just wrapping up a fishing trip here in Dunsmuir, and I thought I'd go out and cast my line a few more times before heading back. Oh, that, that sounds real nice, Hank. Uh. And, and you don't have to apologize. Uh, it, it was real great to see you. You, you, you know what? When, when Luke's back in the country, we can all-- Yeah, well, wait a second. Now where did he go? I mean, uh, Luke was never one to travel for pleasure, in my estimation. He's in Guatemala right now. -Guatemala? -For starters. Um, he's going to Peru after that, but, but right now he's in Guatemala. Whoa. [chuckles] What the heck is Luke doing down there? Missionary work for our church. [chuckles] Luke is doing missionary work? -Mm-hmm. -Your Luke? He's been, um, he's been wanting to share Christ for some time now. Wait, so he's in Guatemala, but then he's, he's, he's going to Peru? So he's, he's, he's in Central America, but then he's traveling to South America? I mean, I just can't see Luke doing that. Uh, I mean, are, are they really that far apart? Yeah, yes, they are. I'm sure of it. I was just as shocked as you when he told me, but you know how Luke is. -Uh-huh. -He's a strong-handed man. And once he gets an idea in his head. [chuckles] Well, all right, Billie, uh, I'll let you get settled in here, uh. Yeah, yeah. Uh, I'm, I'm gonna do that right now. -Okay then. -Okay. Well, it was nice to see you, Hank. Uh, you too, Billie. -[chuckles] All right then. -You too. Bye. [clerk] Welcome to Hotel Dunsmuir, ma'am. You're standing in the tallest building in Siskiyou County. [suspenseful music] We've been here since 1904. Tallest building? It's only one story high. In fact, I was gonna ask why you even call it a hotel. As I said, this is the tallest building in the county. Thing is, these floors go down. -[intense music] -[whooshing] Is that right? [soft orchestral music] Well, I need a room. We'll get you checked in, no time flat. [bell ringing] [suspenseful music] King or queen? Queen's fine. A queen for a queen.

Hey, buddy, uh, wasn't sure if you'd answer. It's Hank. Uh, long time, no time. Uh, listen, where are you? Hank. I'm in the middle of something right now. I can't talk. Yeah, I have to interject, Luke. Uh, are you in the states? Am I in the states? Yeah, Hank. I'm in the states. The hell kind of question's that? So listen, uh, just coming back from a fishing trip in Dunsmuir, uh, just ran into your little lady back there, as a matter of fact. My little lady? Yeah, Billie. Mm. You seen Billie? Who is that, Luke? Who saw Billie? Well that's right. I saw her at the Hotel Dunsmuir. She said you were on a trip south of the border. Hank, you listen up real good. Okay? Billie ran away. She's not right in the head. -She took my money. -Trouble in paradise, eh? Hank, Hank, Hank. I need you to help me out on this. Okay? The, the two of us, we were in country together. That means something, right? Now I know it wasn't the same unit and all that, but it still means something. Is that Hank? Can I say hi? Will you shut the hell up? [traffic whirring] Hank, I need you to turn around. You get back to that hotel. You keep her there. You keep her there till I get there. Okay? Geez, I don't know, Luke. She took my money. You can secure it. Y-You're right there already. I'll be indebted to you. Okay? I owe you. Is that what you wanna hear? Corky's gonna lend me as Honda. I'll be there in three hours. You wait for me. Uh, how much money did you say she took?

The, the door was open. I'm, I'm sorry. [lights buzzing] Well, okay. Yeah, the, the door's open. You're right, but you just, you startled me. Okay? I'm sorry. Sometimes I play my music too loud. I didn't hear you. My apologies. Oh, I'll leave you alone now. [soft dramatic music] Wait, wait. Hey. Hey look, come back here. Okay? Can you come back here? Look, I'm sorry. I'm not, I'm only gonna be in here another minute. I'm heading up north. I just... I play my music too loud too sometimes. Okay? [soft dramatic music continues] [suspenseful music] [Billie breathes heavily] Hey. This is what I was listening to. You can see if you like it.

Are, are you by any chance going through Ashland? Where's Ashland? North. Yeah. I'm heading north. Look, I know we just met and everything, but, but my shift is over after I'm done cleaning this room, and I'm just kind of wondering if you would, would possibly be able to, uh, like give me ride? Wait, sorry. You, you wanna lift up there? I can pay you. Well, how far away is it? It's just 45 minutes. -[soft dramatic music] -[lights crackling] What's your name? Ruby. Tell you what, Ruby. If you can meet me out in the parking lot in five minutes, well, I'd be happy to. I'm Billie. Are you sure? Well, yeah. Uh, I'll just be right outside. Okay. -[soft dramatic music] -[lights buzzing] [suspenseful music] [suspenseful music continues] [Luke slurping] [wind whistling] [Ruby crying] You're crying. No, it's, uh, it's nothing. It's fine. You wanna tell me what's going on? [Ruby crying] I, I'm not going to Ashland. [train screeching] You're not? Honey, where are you going? [breathes heavily] I don't even know why I said that, I'm, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to confuse you. [train screeching] Look, are you going to Ashland or not? I'm your damn driver, I kind of need to know. Yeah. Ashland. I'll go anywhere. Ashland's fine. Ruby, in case you haven't figured out, I'm going through some real heavy right now, okay? I agreed to give you a ride 'cause you seem like a nice girl, but you can't fuck around with me right now. Sugar, this is a one-way train and I sure as hell ain't taking you back. -[soft dramatic music] -I'm not going back. He ties me up when I don't behave. Jesus. Who does that to you? My boyfriend, or my ex-boyfriend back in Dunsmuir. I'm his prisoner. [train shrieking] I saw an opportunity to get out of there with you, so I took it, but I'm, uh, I'm going forward. I'm not going back. [train shrieking] [Ruby cries] Damn, girl, we got a lot in common. [engine revving] [wind whistling] You got a place to go? [soft dramatic music] I'm a survivor. I'll get back on my feet. Always do. [sighs] Okay, Ruby. I gotta tell you something. I'm on the run too. Okay? [scoffs] How about that? We both on the lam. [chuckles] [engine revving] [tires screeching] My grandma, Maddy, she's offered to take me in. She's got a big place. Lots of room. And I love her to death. She's two days away from here, and I'm gonna take you with me. -[wind whistling] -[engine revving] Are, are you sure? Look, let's just get us there, safe and sheltered. Then we can figure out the rest. How's that sound? Yeah. All right then. -[wind whistling] -[engine revving] [door bell ringing] [suspenseful music] [desk bell ringing] [dog barking in distance] [footsteps tapping] [suspenseful music] [lights humming and crackling] [knuckles cracking] [suspenseful music continues] [water dripping] [Luke sighs] Mm. Shit. [Luke exhales] [Luke exhales] -Oh shit! -[intense music] What in the hell? [breathes heavily] Jesus Christ. Hank. [breathes heavily] Shit. [breathes heavily] [suspenseful music] Oh hell. What the hell did you do, girl? [Luke sighs and pounds fist] Shit. [breathes heavily] [suspenseful music] [Luke breathes heavily] Oh. -[intense music] -[The Maid pants rapidly] [engine revving] -[wind whistling] -[soft dramatic music] [birds chirping] [insects buzzing] [urine trickling] There's a whole wide world out here. Luke would never let me see any of it. [cash crinkling] Hey, can I ask you something? [Billie sighs] Did you ever see anything at that hotel you worked at? I've seen lots of things. No, I mean anything strange, or unusual? What did you see? Okay, I'm just gonna say this. Last night in my room, I saw man. And he was wearing the same thing as you. Oh. You saw The Maid. The Maid? Does your phone have internet? [creepy music] [ghost dinging] "The once thriving Gold Rush mountain town of Dunsmuir, California has been a hotbed for paranormal sightings for decades. In particular, the town's historic railroad hotel has been a host to countless encounters with the entity known as "The Maid". In the mid-80's, a traveler at the hotel named Burt Pike murdered a maid who was servicing his room. The police were called after neighboring guests heard screams. Pike attempted to leave the hotel unnoticed by putting on his victim's outfit, but was spotted and chased by police to the subterranean basement where he died by gunfire after a standoff." Whoa. "Investigators later found 13 female bodies buried in the backyard of Pike's home in Tennessee." [gasps] [suspenseful music] There's video footage on here of the hotel. -[intense music] -[Billie gasping] So there you have it. That's crazy. Ruby, I gotta tell you something. Hell, I'm just gonna say it. The day I checked into the hotel, I ran into an old friend of Luke's. And then the next day, that morning you and I met, in my room, under the bed, I saw his body. [Billie grunting] His, his body? -Yes. -Okay, so let me get this straight. The day you and I met, there's a dead man's body under your bed and you're just waiting till now to tell me? Ruby, you have no idea what I've been through. Did you kill him? Your husband's psycho friend, did you kill him? Because if you did, I don't wanna have anything to do with somebody like you. [soft dramatic music] [gasps] What the hell? Ruby? What, what the hell? Is that what you think of me? Huh? That I'm some white trash girl on the road killing people? That's not what I said. I think that's what you meant to say! You got some nerve, girl! I took pity on you! Got your ass outta Dunsmuir away from your own psychopath! I invited you under the roof of my grandma. And you got the sauce to judge me? I'm not judging you. Well what the hell are you doing then? [soft dramatic music continues] I am grateful for you bringing me along with you. I am. Well shit. I'm grateful for you too. Okay? We've been driving all day. Let's get some food and roof over our head. [sighs] It's been too much.

And when I opened the door, there you were, sleepwalking too. And then you followed me to the... [traffic whirring] To the bathroom mirror. We both looked at each other in the reflection. And then The Maid appeared right behind us. [traffic whirring] Okay, seriously. What the fuck? I can't explain it. -[wind whistling] -[engine revving] Ruby, I gotta tell you something. I've been seeing things my whole life. I got that, that E.S.P. [eerie music] I looked it up on the internet, extra sensory perception. You got that too? I don't think so.

Hey, are those my earbuds in your pocket? [suspenseful music] Uh, I'm sorry, I just, I was just curious to try them out. Sure, that's fine. You can try 'em out. Just let me know next time. Yeah? Really, I'm sorry. You know what? I'm gonna buy you a pair of your own. I got money. [distorted jazz music] Anyway, you were saying there's a motel around here? Yeah, it's, uh, Pine... No, no, no, no. It's Juniper. Yeah. It's the Juniper Lodge. Let's rest up tonight. No bad dreams. Tomorrow, we should be at Maddy's. [engine revving] [eerie music] Looks a bit rustic for my taste. It must have gone out of business. I've got some great memories of this place. I'm sad to see it like this.
