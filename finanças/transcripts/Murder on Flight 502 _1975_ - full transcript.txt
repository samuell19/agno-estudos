Nobody knows I'm alive. - That's four years ago. In this business, ancient history. - Don't forget somethin', Benny. You built that agency on my back. - I remember, that's why I'm here. - Yeah but Benny, you make-- - Now look. Listen, for once in your life, listen, Jack.

Maybe his wife. - I'm more worried about his daughter. - [Overhead Announcer] Will Dr. Kenyon Walker report to the TOA First Class lounge? Dr. Walker, report to the TOA First Class lounge. - [Dorothy] Is someone meeting you in London? - My mother. - [Dorothy] Well I'm sure she'll be glad to see you. - She always is. - [Dorothy] Dr. Walker? - What? - [Dorothy] I asked if you were Dr. Walker. - Gruenwaldt, Otto Gruenwaldt. - I'm sorry, Mr. Gruenwaldt. - Excuse me, did you say Dr. Walker, Dr. Kenyon Walker? Is he on this flight? - Why, yes, do you know him? - No, no I don't know him. I don't know him. - I hope you have a nice flight, sir. - Sure hope I don't sit next to him. - [Dorothy] You asked to sit alone. - I always sit alone. - Would you like a Dramamine? Ray? - Hmm? - Would you like a Dramamine? - Why? - You look so tense. - I'm perfectly alright. - Ray, we need this trip. - Well, it was my idea, wasn't it? - Yes, but I just-- - Look, it's what you always wanted. London, Rome, Paris, Athens, now you're getting it. - I know, but it was just so quick, that's all. One minute, I was dressing to go and have dinner at the club, and then the next, I'm packing. - That's the way I always do things, Claire. - No, now actually, you never-- - Oh, will you please stop talking so much? I've got things on my mind. - I hurt, too, Ray. - [Dorothy] Good afternoon, Ms. Briarly. - Nice seeing you again. - [Dorothy] Perfect flying weather. - Sure, I started preparing at noon. Thank you. I bite. - I've had my shots. - Tell me the truth. You're irresistibly drawn to older women, right? - Dr. Walker? - Yes. - [Dorothy] Your service called. - [Dr. Walker] May I have your phone? - [Dorothy] Right over there. - [Dr. Walker] Thank you. [dramatic music] - [Captain Larkin] Good evening Ms. White. - [Karen] Good evening, Captain Larkin. - [Captain Larkin] What are we carrying? - 21 in First Class, 217 in tourist. - [Captain Larkin] Not too bad. - No, can I get you anything? - Not right now. Looking forward to your last trip as a working girl? - I'm looking forward to a small wedding, a house, and some kids. I've been liberated long enough. Well, we're glad you could make it. - Sorry I'm late. The traffic. Ugh, why am I such a klutz? - Aren't you gonna miss all this glamour? - It's glamorous for you. You get to fly sitting down. - I'd like to help you ladies, but someone's got to drive this airplane. - Hello. - Hello. Mr. Paul Barons? - That's right. - [Dorothy] Have a nice flight. - Oh, the possibilities seem rather limited. - I'm sure you'll make the most of it. - Uh, yes, I always do. - [Detective Myerson] Good afternoon. - [Vera] Good afternoon, sir. Can I help you with something? - I'd like to see your Captain. - Oh, certainly, Sergeant. He's upstairs in the cockpit. - Thank you. [knocks on cockpit door] - [Captain Larkin] Can I help you? - [Detective Myerson] Captain Larkin? - Yes. - I'm Detective Sergeant Myerson, New York City Police Department. They said I should check with you about my gun. By law, as a police officer, I'm supposed to carry it at all times. - Yeah, I'm sorry. On this plane, I'm the law. I don't like pistol-packing passengers, even if they're off-duty cops. I'll return it when we land. - Ah, if you ask a question, you get an answer. I'm gonna feel naked without it. - Get lonely, you can have visiting privileges. On vacation? - Don't I wish. No, it's an exchange course with Scotland Yard. They're gonna teach me how to drink tea. I teach them how to keep from getting mugged in Hyde Park. - Have a nice trip. - Take care of the kid. She's touchy. - [Overhead Announcer] Now boarding at gate 12. [speaking in foreign language] TOA flight 502 for London now boarding at gate 12. [gentle music] - [Vera] Right at the counter, first seat. [gentle music] - [Karen] Ms. Briarly? - Oh, God bless you. - [Karen] You will finish this before takeoff? - Don't I always? - Briarly? Mona Briarly? Well, this is indeed a pleasure. I'm Paul Barons. - I'm sure with perseverance, you can overcome it. [he laughs] - Isn't that against regulations? Serving booze before takeoff? - She's an exception. If she doesn't get juiced, she panics when the seat belt sign goes on. Hi. - Hi. - Can I take that for you? - Yeah, sure. They said that I could take it on the plane. - [Karen] OK. I'll just put it with the coats, Mr. Marshall. - Hey, have we met before? - No, it's just that I have most of your records. Well, maybe all of them. - No kidding. So do I. I think that makes two of us, and that's about it. - [laughs] No. [suspenseful music] - Hi. - Didn't you used to be Jack Ainsley Marshall? - Didn't I used? Yes, I used to be Jack Ainsley Marshall. And you wanna know somethin'? I'll be damned if I know who I am now. - I'm sorry, that sounded stupid. I only meant, I mean, you were my all-time favorite. - Well, thank you very much, and listen, you keep the faith because I'm gonna be Jack Ainsley Marshall again. - Oh my dear God. I'm getting off this plane. - Just sit there, just sit there and keep your voice down. - I should've known, I should've known, I should've known. - I just wanna talk to him. - Please Raymond, let's get off this plane. Let's take another plane. No. No. He's gotta know it's not over for either of us. He's gotta keep remembering. - [Control Tower] TOA 502 for London. Cleared for takeoff on runway nine zero. [jet engines roaring] [dramatic music] [plane roars overhead] [dramatic music] [moves into suspenseful music] - Security? TOA First Class lounge. I think we have a bomb in here. Everybody move out quickly. [intense music] [people talking hurriedly] [sirens wailing] [intense music] [clock ticking] - Come on in now, Mr. Davenport, it's safe. A joke. A stupid joke. - Is there anything else around? - Nothing. - [sighs] Middle of the night. Tooth that's killing me. Some idiot's playing jokes. - I don't wanna hear about your problem. I got the call in a motel room. Scared the hell out of me. Thought it was my wife. - Dorothy, what time did you get on duty? - [Dorothy] Five o'clock, Mr. Davenport. - How many flights? - 502 for London and 499 to Frankfurt leaving at 10:15. - Have you got the passenger list for 502? - Yes. - Millard Kensington. - Sir? - Don't ya remember him? Kid about 13. - Oh, yeah, he'll make some analyst rich. - Drive the rest of us crazy in the process. Last year, he boarded a plane with 13 sponges. Blocked up every john on the airplane. I'll have to notify the Captain he's aboard. - Oh, Mr. Davenport, here's a letter addressed to you. If they mailed it, it would've taken a week. They coulda saved the stamp. - With any luck. Oh my God. - What is it? - "By the time you receive this letter, "you will already know about the murders on flight 502." [suspenseful music] Hey fella, can you hurry that up a little bit? - Almost there. - Almost there. [phone rings] Almost there. - Security. One moment, sir. It's the Commissioner. - Hello, Commissioner, what's the decision? We'll I know it's not Treasury, it's not FAA, and it's not Immigration. Well, they're almost four hours out. They can't come back. Every possible alternate airport's socked, and they've got to continue to London. Yeah. Yeah. Yes, I'll keep you posted. Thank you, Commissioner. Well, it's my baby. - I'm all set. [beeping] - TOA flight 502 answering cell call. - Move to 1825, 1825. - It's all yours. - Thank you. Alice, would you bring me that passenger list here? Hello, Captain Larkin? This is Robert Davenport, Kennedy Security. We've got a problem. - Whatcha mean is I've got a problem, right? - Here's the picture. Somebody set off a smoke bomb in the First Class lounge. It turned out to be a practical joke. - So, what's the problem? - You have a passenger in the First Class section, name of Millard Kensington, he's a kid about 13. He did everything but sign his name to it. - You want me to spank him or turn him over to Scotland Yard? [crew laughs] - Just remember who he is. Now he may have had a hand in this, too, but I don't think so. Because of the bomb scare in the lounge, I received this letter a day early. - Repeat that, Davenport, I don't follow. - [Robert] I was supposed to receive this letter tomorrow. Instead, I got it tonight. Is that plain enough? - Go on. - It reads, "By the time you receive this letter, "you will already know about the murders on flight 502." - What? - "If any innocent people "are hurt, I am sorry. "If I die, I want it known that it was the only way." Well? - That's a problem. Don't suppose the guy was thoughtful enough to sign the letter? - But it was left in the First Class lounge, so I suppose it was left by a First Class passenger. - First, I want all the information you can get on the passengers in First Class. All I get are names and addresses. I want backgrounds, medical records, police records, anything. Next, you get a criminal psychologist to go over that data with you. - Thank you, Captain Larkin, I know the procedure. The psychologist is on his way. What do ya think? Is it possible it's a bomb? - I don't think so. If that letter's not a phony, it sounds like he's after particular people, which means we probably got a psychopath on our hands. Religious, political, it could be anything. Look, I'll check out the kid and get back to you. - I'll be here. Alice, would you get me some aspirin? This toothache is killing me. [gentle music] - Will you come upstairs, please? The Captain'd like to see you. [gentle music] - [Millard] Yes, sir? - Sit down, Millard. - Yes, sir. - Millard, all practical jokes are dumb. Some are dumber than others. But some are downright dangerous and people can get badly hurt by them. Do you understand what I'm saying to you? - No, sir. - You left a smoke bomb back at the First Class passenger lounge at Kennedy, didn't you? Didn't you? - I didn't mean to hurt anybody, sir. - Ya didn't, not yet. In addition to the bomb, did ya leave anything else? A letter? - No sir. I just wrote, "Ha ha," on his forehead so everybody would know it was a joke and nobody'd get real scared. - Now, Millard, this is important. Smoke bomb doesn't matter. But the answer to what I'm asking you now could affect the lives of other passengers on this plane. Are you sure you didn't leave a letter addressed to Robert Davenport at the airport? - I don't even know a Robert Davenport. Is he a friend of my father's? - OK. Go on back to your seat. - Yes, sir. - Now Millard. - Yes, sir? - I'll be busy for a while, but later on, come on to the cockpit. I'll show ya how this machine practically flies itself. OK? - Yes, sir. - Hmm, what have we got? - [Alice] My list checks with the stewardess, and Immigration sent over what they had. - Anybody put down Psycho as an occupation? - You know, there are two men that can be of help. A doctor and a police officer. Daniel Myerson. - [Phone Speaker] Davenport, this is Larkin. - TOA 502, this is Kennedy Security, go ahead. - Davenport, don't be so damn formal. There nobody in this frequency except the two of us. I checked out the kid. The smoke bomb's his but not the letter. I'm sure he's telling the truth. - I guess it would have been all too easy. - [Captain Larkin] What have you got for me? - A cop. There's a police office in the First Class section by the name of-- - Myerson, we met. - Well, you can fill him in. Oh, yeah, in case you need one, there's also a doctor, a Dr. Walker. - We got a priest, too. Do we got an undertaker? - As a matter of fact. - I'm sorry I asked. - Thank you very much. The FBI is running the First Class passengers and the crew through their computers. - Ah, this tooth is just drivin' me crazy. - Why don't ya take some more aspirin? - I've been eating 'em like popcorn. Put the passengers' names in alphabetical order, please. - What for? - Alice, don't ask any questions, just do as I say, alright? [plane engines roaring] - We're pretty sure he's a psychopath. Now, how do we spot him? - Well, if he's wearing a Napoleon hat, it's easy. Otherwise, they come in all sizes and shapes. From 11-year-old girls to 80-year-old men. And they all look perfectly normal. - I'll appreciate your help. - Of course. I'll sit in the back of the First Class section. - And do what? - What a cop does best. Wait and watch. - Hold it. - Thought you didn't like guns? - I don't like my passengers getting killed, either. - Listen, if a bullet goes through the skin of this plane, what happens? - Relax, we're still on the warranty. - Well, that's great. [gentle music] Excuse me. Is that seat empty? - Yes it is, Sergeant. - I'll be sitting back there for a while. - OK. - Enjoying your trip, Father? - Oh, very nice, thank you. - Talking is better than thinking. - Huh? - I've seen that look on my late husband's face, God love him. His name was Sam. - Ah ha. - My name is Ida Goldman. - Well, it's very nice to meet you, Ms. Goldman. - If you'd like to talk, a good place to start is with your name. - Uncle Charlie. - Oh, part of the story I know already. [they chuckle] - Your first big hit was A Lonely Shade of Blue. I wore out three different records of it. - Hey, that's really nice. Ya know, that song was on the top 10 in the charts for 22 weeks in a row. I like that song myself. - I mean, you really seem to know what being lonely is all about. - Yeah, well, um, the beat goes on. - Look at 'em, will ya look at him? - Oh, Raymond, stop it. - He's like an animal. - And what do you think you've turned into? - You know she's nothin' more than a baby? [dramatic music] - Are you going to stare at me all the way to London? - Well, I've never met a famous author before. - Do not confuse random seating arrangements with a formal introduction. - Tell me, when was it that you discovered how much rudeness people will take from a celebrity? - I'm sorry, Mr. Barons. It's just that my disposition is rotten at the best of times, and it gets noticeably worse on a plane. I am terrified of flying, and this almost gets me through it. - Oh, well, I understand then. You know, I don't normally gush, but I am a mystery buff. I've read all of your books, and I admire 'em. Now tell me, your style is influenced by A.J. Scott, isn't it? - Hardly surprising. I am A.J. Scott. - Oh? - Now I am also Everett Hicks, and John Wilson, and once in a while, I am even Mona Briarly. - Well, well, I had no idea. Why did you choose male pen names? - Well, one of my earlier husbands persuaded me that writing murder mysteries was very un-ladylike, and as it turned out, he was ladylike enough for both of us. [they laugh] - But you write with such knowledge about crime. - Well, Mr. Barons, writing about crime is much like committing crime. The planning must be meticulous, you... Barons. Barons. Of course. About five years ago, the Federated Bank robbery. If memory serves me right, and it always does, it was $7 million stolen and never recovered. - Ms. Briarly, I am a buyer for a dress house in New York. - And I'm the happy hooker. [he laughs] - Davenport. Are you asleep down there? - Hold it, Larkin, I think we've got our first break. According to the FBI, Dr. Walker is on his way to a country they won't specify to perform a final surgical operation they won't describe. On a Head of State they won't name. But they want him protected. - Well, maybe you can tell me who I'm supposed to protect him from. - [Robert] No such luck. - Look, I'm one hour and 24 minutes from touchdown. Has that shrink arrived yet? - He's going over the stuff now. - He better hurry. This nut's gonna have to make his move inside of that hour and a half. - We know that. Can't you tell Larkin anything about this guy? - Who says it is a guy? - [Robert] Larkin, did ya hear him? - Yeah, I heard him. [dramatic music] - We moved around so much, I never knew where home was. It's like that in the State Department. - Huh, it's like that in show business, too. - After my mother died, I hardly ever saw my father. I mean, I'm sure he loved me, I guess, but he's a very busy man. - A very busy man. - Are you alright, Raymond? - Do you want me to lie to you? - No. - Do you want the truth? - No. - How far to London are we? - Uh, one hour and 12 minutes. - Boy, when we need a tailwind, we never get it. - Something just hit me. - [Fred] What? - This killer, maybe he isn't after the passengers. - Well who else could it be? - One of us. [dramatic music] - May I have some water, please? - [Karen] Oh yes, are you alright, sir? - Why? Is being thirsty a symptom of anything? - No, it's just that you look a bit pale. - My natural color. - If you're not well, there's a doctor among the passengers. I'm sure he'd be glad to take a look at you. - Really? Huh. Well, thank God there's no need. - I can't find it. - Oh, forget it, it's only a serving fork. - Why would anyone steal a serving fork? - To complete a set? Come on, help me get these dishes stowed away. [dramatic music] - You've lived the good life? - Huh? What is a good life? - Always a question with a question. You're sure you're not Jewish? [he laughs] - Methodist. - A good life is helping others without killing yourself. - Ah. Well, yes, I'd say I've had a good life. - I have three children, five grandchildren, never a minute's worry. - You are a very fortunate woman. - Never a minute, but the hours and the days, you shouldn't have to hear. - Ah, I must remember not to interrupt you. - You think there's another way to get a word in? [he laughs] You married? - A dedicated bachelor. - To grow old without a family. - Ah, but I have a very big family. - Without getting married? - Well, when I was 13, my parents were in an accident. My mother lived for two hours. She said to me, "Charlie, take care of the kids." - Sometimes even a mother can make a mistake. [he laughs] - Well, I put them all through college, set them up in business, helped their kids when they needed it, and I still do, as a matter of fact. Something wrong? - You sure you're not Jewish? [he laughs] Three times already. - Three times what? - Three times he walks by like nothing is wrong, which means something is wrong. - Excuse me, Captain? - Yes, sir. - Ms. Goldman is a little concerned. Is something wrong? - It's a little cramped up there. I like to stretch my legs. [he laughs] - Thank you. See? - What I see is a grown up man lying. [dramatic music] - I'm gonna brief the doctor. - Yeah, I think you should. [Mr. Barons laughs] - Come on, can we stop playing games? You're the Barons the police were looking for. - The police found me, questioned me, let me go. Of course, if I were the brilliant criminal you say I am, I would never get caught. - I don't remember using the word brilliant. - Why are you so interested in my alleged crime? - Well, the literature of crime is filled with ingeniously devised and brilliantly executed robberies where the prize is always lost at the last moment. Now you, you got away with the money, and that doesn't merely interest me, it fascinates me. - Well then, you must admit that I deserve at least a small commendation, huh? - What you deserve is a kick in the behind. A security guard was killed at the scene. One of the three holdup men was killed in the getaway, a second found dead in a tenement. - That was the fault of the execution, not the planning. - The third man never did surface. - Well now, let's see, maybe I killed him, made off with the money. - That's a distinct possibility. - Well yes, the police thought so, too. Fortunately, there was no evidence to support that theory. - Well. Here's to new evidence. - You're not gonna find it in a double martini. - That's not where I'm looking, Mr. Barons. [phone rings] - Kennedy Security. One moment. Bob, 63rd Precinct. - Got anything for me, Sergeant? Ah, any idea who? Well, keep at it, will you? There's one card that's gonna be switched. - Which one? - A few months ago, Dr. Walker received threatening phone calls. A man. - [Alice] What kind of calls? - Well, the message was always the same. "If it wasn't for you, she'd still be alive." - Local call? - Uh huh. Why don't ya see if any of the passengers from the New York area had a relative, female, who died on the operating table. - Or if any operation was botched. It happens. - Charlie, please. - Ah, yes. - Excuse me, yes? Stewardess. Young lady, miss. Not me, him. - This may be nothing. - This I've seen, and this is something. - [Karen] Doctor, it's an emergency. The man up front, I think he's having a heart attack. - Get his jacket off. Loosen his collar. Roll up a sleeve. Have you got oxygen? - [Vera] Oh, yeah. - Find his wallet. Look for a medical card, any information about allergies. - [Vera] Please, no smoking while oxygen is in use. - Come on, hurry up with the oxygen. [blood pressure cuff inflating] - Your presumptive diagnosis seems to be correct, miss. He's indeed having a heart attack. - Nitroglycerin. - This isn't his first cardiac episode. - His name is-- - Nevermind his name. Get the Captain down here. - Sir? Thank you. - He's busy now. - Go ahead, Davenport. I'm listening. - OK, OK, as soon as he gets off the horn, alright? - Larkin, will you listen? About a year ago, Otto Gruenwaldt lost his wife. - Davenport, don't give me a damn case history. - According to Gruenwaldt's son, an emergency call was put through to a Dr. Walker, Kenyon Walker. The son thinks that Dr. Walker was at a party. He never got to the hospital, and she died. - Davenport, is Gruenwaldt our psycho? - Well, he threatened Walker, isn't that enough? - It may be academic. - How so? - Vera called. Gruenwaldt is having a heart attack. - What? - Dr. Walker's working on him now. [dramatic music] - [Captain Larkin] Hold it, doctor. - I'm not so sure I can hold it, Captain. - I just talked to New York. - Captain, this man has had an acute myocardial infarction. He's in impending shock. If I don't-- - You've been getting threats. - Some months ago, but surely we can discuss that later. - The calls have been coming from him. - From him? I never met the man, I don't even know his name. - I can't be sure of that, doctor. - You can be sure of this. This syringe contains an antiarrhythmic. If he doesn't get it now, he'll die. - If you knew this is a man who wanted to kill you, and you wanted to get rid of him, you could call it a heart attack, shoot him with anything. - It's been done before, doc. - Then, you make the decision. [dramatic music] - Give it to him. - Get a couple of blankets on him. - I'll want that. - I don't like the implication. - If he dies-- - I've been a doctor for 35 years. I'm answerable for any decision I make that means the difference between life and death, but not to you, just to my peers and my profession. - At this moment, doctor, you're responsible for one life. I'm responsible for 250. - You do your job, I'll do mine. - How long before ya know? - If he's gonna live? A few minutes. - I'll wait. - Suit yourself. But if he dies, you couldn't possibly know if I gave him too much or too little. [dramatic music] - [Robert] Larkin, Larkin, come in. - Yeah, Davenport. - Listen, it's Dr. Ferguson's opinion Gruenwaldt did not leave the letter. Scratch him as a potential. - He scratched himself. Your potential killer Gruenwaldt just had a heart attack. His potential victim Dr. Walker pulled him through. I'm running out of time. - Is there anything else, doctor? - No, that's all. - Do I thank you? - No, just stay quiet. - The man I wanted to see dead saves my life. There's an irony in that, doctor, that I don't find pleasant. The only woman I knew, the only woman I ever wanted to know. - You're a fortunate man. You knew some happiness. - What? She's dead, she died because you didn't get to the hospital. - Mr. Gruenwaldt, at the moment, you're my patient. If you insist on becoming emotional-- - No, no, no, I won't. I won't, I promise. What she needed was a delicate operation. They said you were the best man to do it. But you were at a party. You were talking business, a big deal. She died because money was more important-- - Mr. Gruenwaldt, you're accusing me. Maybe I'm guilty, I don't know. Maybe if I had been there, I could have saved your wife. I wish I could remember the night, but I don't. - A woman dies, and you don't even remember? - Hardly a day goes by that I don't receive an emergency call. Some I can save, some I can't. I try, it's all I can do. - Am I supposed to feel sorry for you? - No. Just try to understand. - You saved my life. I thank you. But I hate you. - And that's something we'll both have to live with. [dramatic music] - $7 million. That in small bills would fill a couple of steamer trunks. - [laughs] At least. - Oh, miss, would you tell the Captain I'd like a word with him, please? - Oh, Ms. Briarly, he's in the cockpit, I don't think he-- - Oh, honey, just tell him it's very important, OK? I'll meet him halfway in the lounge. - OK. - [Mona] Would you excuse me just a moment, please? - Yes. - Oh, and don't go away because I'm not finished with you yet. Hi, Father. Heard any good confessions lately? - [Priest] I beg your pardon? - See ya in church. - I'm a little busy right now, Ms. Briarly, if we could-- - Well, what I have to tell you, Captain, may be what you're busy about. There's an imposter aboard. - An imposter? - There's a gentleman downstairs who is dressed as a priest, but he is not a priest at all. - Now what makes you so sure? - Well, when Mr. Gruenwaldt was having his coronary and Dr. Walker was taking heroic measures to save his life, at no point did our friend in the clerical collar move forward to inquire if Gruenwaldt was a Catholic and would require extreme unction. Now, that is very un-priestly-like behavior. - You're very observant, Ms. Briarly. - It's my stock and trade. Oh, and there's one more thing. I don't know about you, but in all my life, I don't ever remember meeting a priest who wore fingernail polish. - Fingernail polish? - [Mona] Fingernail polish. - I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't mention this to anyone else, Ms. Briarly. - There is something very wrong, isn't there? - Not yet, there isn't. Just turbulence. Here, let me help you down to your seat. - And ruin my reputation? Don't be silly. [gentle music] - [Jack] Hi. [telephone buzzes] - [Karen] Yes, Captain? - We may be getting a break. Put Myerson on. - [Karen] Yes sir. The Captain'd like to speak to you a moment. - [Detective Myerson] Thank you. Myerson. - Listen, there's a chance that priest is a phony. I'll have Davenport check him out. - I'm sitting next to him. - That's right, Davenport, nail polish. - I'll get right on it. Nail polish? - Don't look at me, I'm Lutheran. - Would you get the Immigration report on him? - It does seem a bit unusual. - To say the least. - [Alice] Father Thomas Healy. Address 174 9th, New York City. St. Augustine's. - Why would a man masquerade as a priest? - Possibly a clinical manifestation of religious hysteria. On the other hand, he might be trying to duck some speeding tickets. - [Alice] Line three, Monsignor O'Brien. - Monsignor? I hate to bother you at this hour, but-- oh, this is Robert Davenport, Security at Kennedy Airport. No, no, nothing like that, but I do have a question for you. Sir, do you have a Father Thomas Healy at St. Augustine's? I see. Well, thank you. Yes, thank you, Father. Sorry to have bothered you. They had a Thomas Healy. He died four months ago. [guitar music] - Ya know what? Ya know what I think we oughta do? I think you and I are gonna write a hit song right now, right this minute. - Hey, why don't we call it Come Fly with Me? - Come Fly with Me. How 'bout this for a song? I got those lonely in three continents, cryin' in five languages blues over you baby cha cha cha, no, you're not goin' for that one? - [laughs] No. Ya know, I was really down when I got on this plane. I wanna thank ya for the lift. - That makes two of us. - How long has he been up there? - Maybe they're just having a drink. - Now, Claire, Claire I know what I'm doing. - God didn't make you his judge and jury. - God didn't take her from us. He did. - Raymond, it's all over. There's nothing you can do about it. - Like hell I can't. [guitar music] ♪ You're the prettiest girl ♪ I've ever seen ♪ I bet you're only 17 ♪ Say you'll stay and we won't part ♪ Little girl you stole my heart - [Marilyn] My own special song. - [Jack] Aww, shucks, you're gonna make me blush. Tour ain't nothin'. [intense music] - Look out! Look out! Stop it, let go of him! Let go of him! Help, help, he's killing him! Help! Stop it! Help, help me, somebody! Help! [grunting as they struggle] - Drop it, I'll blow your head off! Drop it, drop it! [intense music] [Ray sobs] [dramatic music] - [Captain Larkin] Davenport, will you listen to me? - Wait a minute, Larkin, will you wait a minute? This is important. You have a passenger, Raymond Garwood, I repeat, Raymond Garwood. Now according to the New York Police, some months ago, his daughter-- - You're something else, Davenport. Garwood just tried to kill Jack Marshall. - [Robert] What? - Tried, nobody was hurt. One broken guitar string. - Well, did he admit to leaving the note? - [Captain Larkin] He denied it. - Well what does Myerson think? - He thinks he's telling the truth, so do I. - Scratch Garwood and Marshall. - What about the priest? - [Robert] He's a phony, that's for sure. The FBI is running him through the computer now. We'll have something on him soon. - Make it damn soon. We're running out of time. - [Claire] I'm sorry. [gentle music] - You didn't do anything, ma'am. - I should have warned you. - Why me? I don't know him. What did I ever do to him? - You killed my daughter. - What the hell is? What are you talkin' about? - She was found dead in your bedroom. - God. Come on, that was in all the papers. The girl OD'd. I wasn't even there. Hey, it was a party, yeah, and it was at my place, but I left early. I never knew what happened. The police cleared me, everybody knows that. - They told him, but he's never stopped blaming you. - Yeah, well, that's crazy! - We were gonna have a surprise party for her 16th birthday. [gentle music] - Talk to him. - What can I say to him? - Anything but the truth. I knew my daughter, Ray didn't. - Look, your daughter dated a couple guys in the band, but she was... - I know what she was. Ray only has a memory of her. Please, help him. - I'll try. [gentle music] Look, I... I'm really sorry, I'm really sorry about your daughter. I wish there was somethin' I could say to ya to make ya feel better. - She talked about you all the time, played your records all the time. When she ran away, I knew where she was going. - Yeah, well see, she met one of the guys in my band, and he brought her to my place. Honest, I never knew her, I never met her. Except ya know what, everybody said she was a real nice person. - How does she get mixed up in drugs? - It just happens, Mr. Garwood. Kids wanna be part of somethin' today, ya know? They'll do anything to be part of somethin'. They meet the wrong people, they get in the wrong hands. It just happens. - How do you stop 'em? - I don't think enough people try. But ya know what? You tried Mr. Garwood, ya really tried. She talked to Ray and she'd tell Ray how hard ya tried. And how good ya were to her. She really did. - She said that? - Yeah, and Mrs. Garwood. She talked about how ya both loved her. - She said that? - [Jack] She did, she really loved ya a lot. She thought about ya all the time. - You're going to Europe on business? - Vacation. - Me, I'm always taking vacations, thanks to my children. - They must love you very much. - I'm their mother, no? So, they're always sending me on vacations. - You are a very lucky woman. - You weren't listening, Charlie. - Yes, I heard. I saw the look on your face, but well I, I don't like to pry. - It showed. So, like I was saying, they always send me away. Maybe I do get in the way. Maybe I'm too much of a mother. Maybe I butt in a lot. You figured that out, no? - Not butt in. You're interested in people. - So how come when I go on vacations I sit in the hotel room until it's time to go home? [ominous music] [moves into intense music] - [Alice] If he's on schedule, he has exactly 40 minutes to touch down. - [Dr. Ferguson] We may be on the wrong track. - People don't go around masquerading as priests. He's got to be on there. [gentle music] [knocking on cockpit door] - [Detective Myerson] Larkin, it's Myers. You got a minute? - [Captain Larkin] Yeah, we're on auto. Besides, my First can handle things. - I think our problem might be a little more complicated than we thought. - [Captain Larkin] What do ya mean? - [Detective Myerson] Target might be the crew. - It crossed our minds. - I want you to give me the rundown on everybody including yourself. - [Captain Larkin] My whole life history? - No, I think it's this particular flight. - Well, I've been on the New York to London flight two years. My engineer's been with me eight years. - [Detective Myerson] Always Europe? - No, I've flown every domestic route but only two years trans-Atlantic. - What about your co-pilot? - [Captain Larkin] Just signed on. - And the ladies? - Head stewardess Karen's been with TOA about 18 months. Four years of global before that. Oh, and for the record, she's getting married. This is her last flight. - That's a great way to start a honeymoon. What about the other one? - Vera? She's cheerful and bright. Bumps into things a lot. - [Detective Myerson] Yeah, I noticed that. How long's she been around? - Five, six years on this run. - Just to touch all bases, and I want ya to level with me. Have you ever been responsible for an accident which people were killed? - Did you ever kill an innocent bystander? - It's nothing personal. - Sure it's personal. It's what I do for a living. Passengers get on this plane, they can't wait to get off. They're mostly worried about boredom. But every minute they're on board, pilots, like me, are responsible for their lives. - [exhales loudly] Yeah. Well, when they're on the ground, your passengers think that policemen do nothing except hand out traffic tickets until they're in real danger. Yeah, when there's trouble, then cops like me have the same responsibility. Now that's what I do for a living. - Like you said, makes us professionals. It's up to us to handle it, huh? - Incidentally, I never shot anybody I wasn't aimin' at. - That's OK. I never lost a plane or a passenger. - Captain? - Yeah. - Kennedy Security, they say it's important. - Yeah, Davenport. - [Robert] Larkin, we got lucky. We got a make on the priest. - How lucky? - A long rap sheet. He's a three-time loser, all felonies. His real name is Melvin Hoffman, H-O-F-F-- - I know how to spell it, Davenport. Is he wanted? - Not 'til now. He's been on parole for five years, clean, perfect record. But now he's left the country illegally with a passport stolen from a dead priest. - We may have our man. - Yeah. [dramatic music] - [Karen] Excuse me. - Where's the priest? - I don't know. He didn't ring for anything, so I really-- - I'm gonna check the johns. You wait right here. - Is he the one? - We'll soon find out. [suspenseful music] They're both empty. - Maybe he went back in the tourist section. - Yeah, that's possible. Now, look, you walk back there nice and casual-like, alright? If you spot him, you keep right on walkin'. I'll wait here, I don't wanna spook him, OK? - Yes, sir. - [Detective Myerson] Easy now. [dramatic music] - Every passenger's accounted for. - That can't be. - Sergeant, there's six girls working back there. They've checked and rechecked every name. - Keep your eyes open. [suspenseful music] [knocks on cockpit door] Larkin. He's not here, he's not anywhere. - Sergeant, nobody gets out of a 747 at 38,000 ft. If a door opens, you'll know it. - OK, we'll check again. He's not up there. He's nowhere on this whole plane. - Sergeant, nobody gets out of a-- - Out of a 747 at 38,000 ft. Yeah, I know, I know. Where's this go? - It's an elevator to the storage hold. It's where we keep food and special cargo. - Never noticed it before. [elevator motor starts] [dramatic music] [Karen screams] - [Passenger] Something's wrong, something in the back. I heard a some sound back there, I don't know what it is. - Everybody sit down! That goes for you, mister. I said sit down! Doctor, I'm gonna need you. I know he's dead, but according to the book, you gotta make it official. I don't want anything touched, just make sure. [dramatic music] - You sure he's dead? - Yes, strangulation. - Thanks, doc. Go on back to your seat now. - Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention, please. This man is Detective Sergeant Myerson of the New York Police Department. - Captain, there's been a murder on board. [passengers talk over each other] I think it's time you told everyone exactly what's going on. - Someone from First Class left a message at the airport. It said there'd be a murder on this flight. A man was killed who was not a priest. He was a known criminal. His murder may be what that letter was all about. If so, then no one has anything to be concerned about. - Except the person who killed him. - I'm gonna ask all of you to remain in your seats throughout the rest of the flight and until the British authorities take charge. Wanna add anything? - Did any of you see anything that you wanna tell us about? [dramatic music] Nobody ever sees anything, do they? [dramatic music] - What? - [Captain Larkin] You heard me, Davenport. Hoffman was murdered. - Well who did it? - [Captain Larkin] We don't know. - Well, I'll relay that information to-- - Davenport, my plane and my passengers are still in danger. I mentioned a murder. I didn't tell 'em the note said murders, plural. - [Robert] We know that. - Come up with something before they find out I'm lying through my teeth. - A man is killed, and it don't worry you? - A month ago, it would have. - What does that mean? - I stayed too long at the fair. - I like that, and I think I know what it means. And that, I don't like. - Ida, tell me more about yourself. - Me you know. You, I thought I knew, but now I don't know. - I don't want to burden anyone. - That part of you I learned before. So, try to burden. See if it hurts. - You are very easy to talk to. You sure you don't mind? - I promise. - Well, it was quite unexpected. I have a complete physical every year, and-- - Now I know. How long did they give you? - Three, maybe four months. Not going to burden you with my problem. - My children say, "Momma, don't worry, we'll handle it." - And that's as it should be. - But instead, they worry and I handle it. - I'll bet you do. - Mr. Barons, your slip is showing. - What are you talking about? What do you mean? - Well, even allowing for the normal impact of a murder on board a plane, you were devastated when that priest was found. - Well maybe not to you, but murder's a shocking thing to anybody. - But even more so to someone who knew the victim? You know, the Captain told us that he was not a priest. In fact, I told the Captain, but I think you knew even before I did that he wasn't. I think that you know exactly who he was and exactly what he was doing on board this plane. [dramatic music] - Hey, do you want me to do that? - No, it's alright. I'll take up the sandwiches. Why don't you just bring the coffee when it's ready. - OK. - [Karen] Anything new from Kennedy? - Been jumping all over Davenport, but it hasn't done much good. - [Karen] I met him, he's not a bad guy. - If we get out of this without any more trouble, no thanks, you can invite him to your wedding. - If we ever get out of this plane. - You stay in the cockpit. You'll be safe here. - You think so? I might be Jack the Ripper. - Oh, come on. - That's funny, Fred, funny. 16 more minutes, it's all over. [dramatic music] [tray crashes on the floor] - [Alice] What time is it? - Eight minutes to touch down. - How's the tooth? - Thanks for reminding me. - So we both ache a little. - [Fred] Wash up time. Be back in a minute? - [Captain Larkin] OK. - [Fred] Excuse me. [dramatic music] Captain. It's Vera. She's dead. - God, how, where? - In the john, strangled. [dramatic music] - [Captain Larkin] Where were you? - Right here, what's wrong? - Vera's been murdered. [passengers talking over each other] - That's impossible. Nobody left this section. - He's topside and dead. - I'm tellin' ya, nobody even got out of their seats. I never took my eyes off of 'em. What about tourist? - Nah, nah. Better keepin' somebody in First Class. - Yeah. - [Captain Larkin] And I better radio it in. - [Claire] What's happening, Raymond? - I don't know. - It shouldn't happen to someone so young. - It's incredible. - Charlie, I've made a decision. If we live through this, oh, are we gonna live. - My my, look who's heading for AA. You need this more than I do. - Listen, what I don't need right now is a drunken broad. - Under ordinary circumstances, I would resent the drunken part of that statement. - Can't you get it through that big ol' brain of yours that there's a homicidal maniac on this plane? - No, I don't think so. - Oh no? He's already killed two people. - No, not a maniac, Mr. Barons. A maniac, at least in my books, doesn't leave advance notice in a letter at the airport. No, I definitely think there's a connection between these two murders. And of course, seeing as you knew Hoffman. [dramatic music] Something I said, Mr. Barons? - Look, look, you've got to help me. - Well, of course, Mr. Barons. - But I think, you see, I have reason to believe that I'm next. - Next what? - Victim, the next one to be killed! - Now, how would you ever get a notion like that? - Well you see, Hoffman, the phony priest, he was an associate of mine. And that stewardess, he must have made a deal with her. - Now, wait a minute, wait a minute, calm down. You're not making any sense. What kind of a deal? - What difference does it make what kind of a deal? I'm telling you, I'm the next on to be killed! - You think it was Hoffman who hired the stewardess to get all that money out of the country? - Yes, yes, he had to be. That's the connection, don't you see? And I'm next! - You know something, Mr. Barons? I think you're right. - No, no, no. - Just turn around. - Now listen. - Just turn around. - [Mr. Barons] Now listen! - Now would everybody please turn around? Thank you. I'm gonna need some witnesses up in the lounge. - Let me explain! - Barons, just be quiet. I'd like the two of you. Mister, don't make me hurt you. [dramatic music] - Listen! - Barons. Just move to the end of the plane. - You don't understand. - Both of you. - [Ida] We better do like he wants. - And if we don't? - Dear, when a crazy has a gun, you do. - Mister, you and your girlfriend. - [Jack] OK, don't worry about it, it's gonna be alright. Let's just coop, come on. - OK, doc. - This man is ill. I'm not leaving him. - Of course, I understand. You have your job to do. I have mine. Mr. Barons. [dramatic music] Ms. Briarly, I especially want you. Yeah, I think you are really gonna appreciate the next few moments. - You don't have to waive that cat pistol around at me, Sergeant. Ya couldn't keep me away with a cannon. - Look, I-- - Walk. Up. Now hold it. Please, nobody comes up these stairs, understand? Nobody. - Myerson, will you-- - Shut up! Now move. [dramatic music] Alright, all you folks move over to that side. Please. Mr. Barons, up against the bar. Ah, that's fine. Yeah, that's just gonna work fine. - Myerson? What the hell's going on? - Justice, Captain, a little late, but most effective. You're about to witness an execution. - [Captain Larkin] Myerson, put the gun down. - I don't wanna hurt anybody, Captain, just him. So please do what I say. You move over there. Thank you. Now, all of this is gonna be perfectly legal. Everything done by the book, and all of you, all of you are going to be the witnesses. - For God's sake! - God? What do you know about God? This man. Five years ago, this man engineered the robbery of the Federated Bank. $7 million scored and a security guard killed. - I didn't kill anybody. - An ex-cop. They shot him in the back. It wasn't a great heist, sloppy really. Sloppy, but you got away with it. The whole Department made to look like jackasses, and everybody laughed. They laughed at the law because you got away with it. Ya see, once somebody gets away with something, once somebody gets away with a crime, the law, it looks ridiculous, and justice is defeated, and the jungle takes over. And I wasn't going to let that happen. Oh, I wasn't gonna let that happen. We all knew Barons organized it. He flaunted it in our faces, but we couldn't prove it. Oh, you gotta have proof, don't ya? Yeah, you gotta have proof. Three longs years, I haunted every stoolie in New York. A break came finally when somebody fingered Hoffman. See, Barons was using Hoffman to smuggle the stolen money out of the country in small parcels, building up a year-a-dollar account somewhere, but how? Who could make regular trips to Europe, 20 or 30 a year, without attracting attention? [laughs] Simple wasn't it, huh? Ah, sure, somebody on a crew of a regular flight to Europe. Somebody like a stewardess. Mister, I have been doggin' your tracks for five years now. Everybody else gave up, but I wouldn't. I wasn't about to. Oh, you're sweating, Mr. Barons. Oh, I like that, yeah, that's nice. Go on, lick your own juice. Taste it! Go on, I want ya to taste it! I want ya to know how that guard must have felt five years ago before he was blown in half. You don't even remember his name, do ya? Oh, you should have remembered his name. He was quite a man. Seven years older than I was. Yeah, he was quite a man. His name was Myerson, too. - Myerson, we're close to touch down. I gotta get to the cockpit. - Your copilot can handle that. - I gotta give him instructions. He's never made this airport. Myerson, there are 250 people on this plane! [dramatic music] - I'll give you 30 seconds. - Alright, give me 20 seconds and hit the oxygen switch. - What? - Just do it. - Captain, thank you. I went through the crew's hand luggage in the storage hatch down below. The last shipment of the stolen money, about $60,000, was in Vera Franklin's bag. Case closed, and justice is done. You see, Mr. Barons, nobody's laughing now. The jury's in. And you know the verdict. - Myerson, listen to me. The passengers, their lives are our responsibility, it's out job, remember? We're the professionals! - I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. But I have waited so long for this. [intense music] [gun fires] [intense music] [people yelling] - Come on, come on! [coughing and screaming] [Myerson screaming] - Give me a hand, someone! Get him up! - Get the fire extinguishers up here! - Captain, it's Fred, he needs you. - Go downstairs, help with the passengers. Alert London to the fire in the lounge. Have the girls in coach prepare for an emergency landing. [dramatic music] - Sit down in your seats and fasten your seat belts! Sit down! [alarm blaring] [sirens wailing] [dramatic music] - We have a fire! - [Air Traffic Control] How many engines? - Not the engines. We have a cabin fire! - Flaps 20. - Flaps 20. - Harold, if this cockpit fills with smoke. - Gotcha! - How do we look? - [Air Traffic Control] You are north two degrees. Please turn to accommodate. You are three miles from touch down. [dramatic music] - [Captain Larkin] Flaps 40. - Flaps 40. - Gear down. - Gear down. [dramatic music] - [Captain Larkin] Flaps 50. - [Fred] Flaps 50. - Final checklist. - Checklist complete. - 100 feet. 50 feet. [dramatic music] - I'll drink to that. - [Fred] 90 knots. - [Captain Larkin] Flaps up. - Flaps up. [sirens wailing] - Brakes set. - [Robert] Larkin, Larkin, do you read me? - Davenport. - Larkin, Larkin, get this. It's the cop, Myerson. His precinct doesn't even know he's gone, and his Captain thinks he's headed for a complete nervous breakdown. Larkin, Larkin, do ya read me? - Ya know something, Davenport? Your security stinks. - [Karen] Is everybody alright in here? - Yeah. How are the passengers? - They're shook, but OK. What a nightmare. - Fred, Harold, take care of 'em, will you? - [Harold] Yeah. - [Fred] Sure, Captain. - Karen? - Is something wrong, Captain? - Everything. It's a lousy world, isn't it, Karen? Poor, clumsy little Vera. - Yeah, how do you suppose she got mixed up in something like this? - Ah, easy I guess. Somebody was smuggling the money for Hoffman. When he was killed, they panicked and put the money in Vera's suitcase. - What do you mean? - Myerson killed the wrong stewardess, didn't he? Both you and I know Vera didn't have that money when she came on board. She spilled her bag, remember? You helped her put her things back. There was no money then. No money until you panicked and transferred it from your bag. You were right about one thing. This is your last flight. - [Karen] Hey, Captain. - [Captain Larkin] Goodbye, Karen. [dramatic music] - [Overhead Announcer] Flight 192 for New York now ready for boarding at gate 14. Flight 192 now boarding at gate 14. - Your luggage has been taken care of. I've left instructions. No less than seven days at the hospital. - [Otto] Well, I can use it. - I'm leaving for west Germany tomorrow. Perhaps we could spend an evening, have dinner, when we get back. - I play a passable game of chess. - I can be reached at circle six-- - I think I can remember the number, doctor. [he laughs] - We'll see Sir Laurence Olivier and the Tower of London and Buckingham Palace, and maybe we'll even get to see the Queen. - Mr. Garwood. I'm really sorry. - Good luck. - Right. - Darling, we're going to have a wonderful time. There's a porter out here. - Do you think it's kosher sharing a room? - [laughs] We can get the best in every hotel in Europe. - What will people say? - They'll call us swingers. [they laugh] - Are you taking care of the luggage? Good. Get clearances from the passengers, stop. Expect first draft in three weeks, stop. Arrange immediately hard cover and paperback Mona Briarly's new thriller Murder on Flight 502, stop. Am I going too fast for you? On my way to... [dramatic music] - You. As a man responsible for the safety of others, Captain, I'm sure that you understand the necessity for my actions. It's our sworn duty to protect and secure the public, but at times, times as in my case, normal procedure fails. We must use our own initiative. We accept responsibility. That's why people like us are given the authority. And I'm sure you agree that to allow those three to profit from their own crime would have been wrong, totally wrong. Consequently, I took action. But once I explain to my superior officers, once I explain the situation and my solution, after the Departmental inquiry, that's standard procedure, after all the paperwork's in, I'll probably receive another citation. I've gotten three in the past 22 years. Oh, and I'm gonna commend you, too, Captain. God knows you did a fine job. Yes, sir, fine job. A fine job. [dramatic music]
