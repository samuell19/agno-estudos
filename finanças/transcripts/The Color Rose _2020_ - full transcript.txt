Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. ♪ Fool me once fool me twice ♪ ♪ Hold my hand cross the line ♪ ♪ When the blood starts to rise ♪ But this story isn't about truth, or love... This story is about sin. My name is Aubrey Miller... ...and this is how my body ended up at the bottom of a lake. The Lord says there are six things He hates. Seven that are an abomination to Him. Charm is deceitful, and beauty is vain... You know, it goes on the same, whether you take five minutes or 50. By the way... Kit has called three times this mornin'. This kid is obsessive, Grace. He's not a kid. Have you done your morning scriptures today? Seriously, Luke? Please go get a life. Just until you leave. I hope your friend Tori doesn't make you late for school... again. Don't worry, Father. We'll be there on time. Have a good day, honey. She'll be fine. So, what happened last night? Well, we're... we're over. He definitely didn't take it well. Want me to cut his dick off? Katie! Are you serious? What? I was tired of white. So, I called Daddy, and an hour later, the dealership drove one over. Some girls want the diamond watch; others want the time. Molly, get out. You're getting shit all over the backseat. Where's Aubrey? "You treated me with kindness even though I've been cruel to you." Oh, there are my friends. What did I tell you about those girls? - They're no good. - They're no good. ♪ I choke on the blood ♪ ♪ I'm someone you should feel ♪ ♪ That I think you should run ♪ ♪ Run ♪ ♪ I think you should run ♪ ♪ Run ♪ ♪ I think you should run ♪ ♪ Run ♪ ♪ I think you should run ♪ ♪ Run ♪ Out! Go on. I should probably explain who I am. Or better yet, who we are. We are "The Sins." Or at least that's what everyone likes to call us. It was started as a stupid joke, six months ago, and has stuck ever since. At first, we hated the title. Everyone turned a blind eye to Grace and Tori's friendship, but I always knew there was something more between them. I love spending alone time with you. It's too bad it has to be in a bathroom stall though. Homosexuality is a sin in itself. Okay, everyone. One thing each... Do we have to do this every day? You know the drill. Come on. I'll start. Grace, you look happier today. Thanks, Mol. Katie, nice stockings. Uhh... Robyn, your cubby doesn't smell so bad today. Stacey, nice nails. They look just like Katie's. Hmm. Huge compliment. Umm... Tori... your lips look so hot. I guess that leaves you, Aubrey. Umm... Oooh, saved by the bell. Growing up in a religious town like ours, sins were dreaded, even feared. But soon we started to enjoy the attention. Katie Hamilton. Greed. She gets whatever she wants. All she needed to do was call her Daddy. Stacey Rodgers. Envy. You'd think she'd appreciate all the yacht trips and gifts from the Hamiltons, but she didn't. Hence where she got her sin. Robyn Pearce. Sloth. She's already been offered a full-ride athletic scholarship to eight Division One schools across the country. Problem with Robyn is, things come easy for her, but she won't do anything about it. Molly McIver. Gluttony. Everyone loves Molly, except Molly. Probably why she's always stuffing her face. I don't hate anyone. Hate is such an awful word. But I sure as h-e-double hockey sticks hated Tori Davidson. Wrath. She's emo, as you can see. And some days, she's punk. With Tori, you never really know what you're gonna get. Kind of like a box of chocolates... or whatever that quote is. I think it's pretty obvious she has a few anger issues, but that's also part of her charm. And that's me, Aubrey Miller. Pride. It's awful that I was associated with a sin. But at the same time, it meant I was popular. For a little while. So I cared about my grades. So I spoke up in class. Why wouldn't I? I knew all the answers... to everything. I had two Bibles. One for home, one for school. So what? I did take pride in my life. All of it. I don't even know why pride is even a sin. And last, but not least... Grace Carver. Lust. Of everyone, she deserved her title the least. Grace was a virgin, but once people started calling us The Sins, everything changed. Even her sexuality. And why didn't anyone think to rat us out? Fear? Indifference? Good morning. Do not worry about your life, what you will eat; or about your body, what you will wear. Oh, Tori. We do not doodle on the Good Book. Life is more than food, and the body more than clothes. Consider the ravens: they do not reap or sow, they have no storeroom or barn... yet, God feeds them. Jesus! You done? Miss Davidson, to the principal's office, now! Quiet! Now, who can tell me which passage that is from? Yes, Aubrey. John. No, that's not it. Anyone else? Stacey? Miss Pearce, would you like to take a crack at guessing which passage this is from? I don't know. Luke 12:22. Grace. Very good. Now, if we could all turn to passage 12:23. I admit... I love being friends with Grace. I was proud to be in the circle, but lately... I was starting to feel envious towards her, and that wasn't even my sin. Sorry, honey. I don't know what happened. I changed those sparkplugs. So it wouldn't even turn over? It's so weird to me. I'll take care of it, okay? Don't worry about it. My hero. Don't forget, Andy and Summer are coming over for dinner tonight, so be home by seven. No! Come on, I just... I don't think I can handle your brother. The last time he spoke to me about potpourri for like 90 minutes. I don't even know what potpourri is. I just like... Oh, Maggie! What are you doin' to me? Maggie? The car's fine, isn't it? What? Right here? In the Lord's library? I got an engine you can start. You've got nine and a half minutes before the next bell, mister. Vroom-vroom. Alright. I can do this. Nine minutes. Easy... easy peasy. Hold on. Okay. Sheriff Middleton. Oh, hey, Aubrey. What can I do you for? I didn't see you at church on Sunday. Shouldn't you be in class? Oh, I actually help Mrs. Middleton with the little ones this block. - Hmm. - I'm headed there now. I tried to go earlier, but the door was locked. Yeah, um... Well, Mrs. Middleton and I were just discussing a family matter. Oh, that makes sense. - Well, I better go. - Okay. By the way, you have something on your collar. Gotcha. Faith is as important as the law. But, in a town like this, there is no church versus state... because... church already won. It's okay. You good? Yeah. Hey. Can we talk? Yeah. Have fun. I needed to talk to you. I told you not to just show up like this. Grace, I'm... I'm really sorry about what happened last night. Kit, I just need space. Perfect! I'll enroll in NASA. How's that for space? You're so pretty when you smile. Wait... - What? - I just... What are we waiting for? This is so stupid. I just can't do this. Why? I'm sorry. It just doesn't feel right. I'm sorry. Gracie? Baby, what's the matter? Uh, Kit just dropped me off. Kit? II thought you guys... Yeah, no... uh... we broke up. Right. You make waves with the girl who likes you yet? Not yet. No. What's with the bare feet? Grounding. You should really try it! It'd be so good for you. It's the new moon tonight. Summer equinox soon! Good vibes all around. Love and light, baby girl. Love and light. That's Summer Dobson. She used to babysit us when we were little. I always had a creepy feeling about her. You know the people who claim they're all love and light and positive? Well, they're usually the most broken. Andy? What's with the blood? Eh, it's nothing. Just cut myself. I'm making this flower crown for Summer. I saw her outside, she was... - barefoot? - Hmm. Oh yeah, that's Summer. I should probably clean this up. Yeah, probably. Hello, Grace. Principal Eldridge? You, uh, shopping for someone special, or? Hmm, just the house. Oh. This will do nicely. Uh, that'll be ten dollars. Yes. Alright. And enjoy the sunset. That was my principal. What? Grace? Grace, I need the bathroom. Dinner's almost ready and Luke needs to piss and I need to take a number two. Give me number two-ooo minutes. Get out, G! Grace! You're going to turn into a prune. Bless this food to our bodies... Amen. Amen. No one eats until we talk. Great, another family meeting. Someone came to confess today, Grace. Someone from your school. Who? It doesn't matter who. The Sins, Grace? You and your little posse are parading around school, calling yourselves The Seven Deadly Sins! Okay, we don't call ourselves that What is he talking about, Grace? Tell her, Grace. Tell your mother about your cult. There'll be some changes around here. For everyone. From now on, you will walk in the path of the Lord. And Hannah, as Grace's older sister, it is your responsibility to lead by example. First off, I want both of you to help out more at the church. Grace, you can come after school I work at the flower shop after school. "I work at the flower shop after school." Not anymore you don't. And you're not to spend any more time with that Andy Lund. In fact, I don't want you spending time with any people outside of our church community. And that includes Kit. He's a worldly boy, Grace. Why would you even engage with a worldly boy, anyways? - Luke. - Well, you're not gonna have to worry about the "worldly boy" anymore. Because we broke up. Good. Very good. And I don't want you hangin' around Tori anymore, either. What? Why? Can you ever just do as he says, without asking questions? Can you ever stay out of things that don't involve you? Enough! I've had my suspicions about Mrs. Davidson for a while now. And today, this person who came to confess... confirmed it. Fine. I'll just be a good little lamb and follow blindly in the path of the Lord. Baaah. Dean. A good little lamb? It's not funny. Come on, Luke, it's a little funny. Baaah! Not hungry? Who could possibly have an appetite after that? Give them time. "Do not grieve, for the joy of the Lord is your strength." I believe in them. Oh, Lucifer. Welcome back, Grace. Did you have to sneak out again? Pastor Carver, he's your dad, right? - Yeah. - You've got a hot daddy. So do I. Hmm. You know what to do. You know what I've been thinking? What if Satan was the good one, and God was bad? I don't think so. Satan's a pretty naughty boy. Do you want to be naughty, Grace? Sometimes. The cards are showing you do. They're showing me something creepy. What does he want her to do? Who's he? Lucifer. He wants you to say his name. Come on. Help her out, Ronnie. She's scared. Oh, Lucifer... You try, Grace. He wants to meet you. Say it! Don't be rude. Take my hands. Repeat after me. Somnus, spiritam, vocant. Somnus, spiritam, vocant. Somnus, spiritam, vocant. - Somnus... - Close your eyes. What do you see? It's her. It's the girl. What is she doing? She's in the bath. Now what do you see? Are you kidding me? If people want to talk, then let's give them something to talk about. Okay. Katie. I've got a task for you. ...remembering that we sow... what we reap. The Bible teaches us this in many ways. Now, moving on to the Old Testament, the psalm It's strange because I almost stayed home that day. I wasn't feeling well, mainly because I felt guilty. 150: 1 through 6, Praise the Lord in His sanctuary. Praise Him in the firmament of His strength. Praise Him for His mighty deeds. They stole my journal. How could I have been so stupid? I trusted them. Praise Him for His sovereign majesty. Praise Him with the blast of a trumpet, praise Him with lyre and harp. Praise Him with strings and pipe. Praise Him with sounding cymbals. Praise Him with clanging cymbals. Let everything that has breath praise the Lord. Corinthians 9:6. Those who sow sparingly reap sparingly. ♪ Impressing you hmm ♪ ♪ Don't be surprised that's what I do ♪ ♪ I slay ♪ ♪ And I mean that boo ♪ ♪ From the curls in my hair to the tips of my shoes ♪ ♪ Slay oooh too grown for this ♪ ♪ Ain't nobody trying to trespass ♪ ♪ Not too many girls to beat ♪ Practice is over, ladies. Uhh... I think there's been a bit of a mix-up. Uhh... does it look like I'm in the mood for a bit of a mix-up? Yeah, your whole cult looks pretty mixed up actually. I'm sorry? What did you just call us? - A cult? - Okay. We actually reserved back-grass for practice today, so Get the hell out of my field. Now! Did she seriously just say "hell" to you? We should start calling them The Seven Trashy Sins. You're some pastor's daughter! Okay. Have a nice day! - Bye. - Bye. Okay, everyone. Sit. What are we doing? We've been betrayed. We have a rat amongst us. And action must be taken. - Huh? - Isn't it obvious? I don't know. Whose journal is that? Uh... Aubrey? Ding, ding, ding, ding. Our dear friend took it upon herself to go and pay my father a visit. She wanted to make a little... confession. About us being called The Sins. What? No. She wouldn't do that. Well, she did. And she threw us to the wolves. "Grace and the girls are known as the sins. I will not associate myself with those who do not follow in the path of the Lord." Katie, did you steal two pairs of panties from a department store in Miami last summer? Yeah, but why would she put that in there? And Stacey, she knows you're sleeping with your History T.A. What? No, I'm not. I mean, I wanted to. But I didn't. He said no. There are pages and pages talking about how you overindulge in everything. She even called you disgusting. Speaking of disgusting, Robyn. She wrote down exactly how personally offended she is by your slothyness. And then she's goes on to say that she wouldn't be surprised if you cheated on all of your exams. But if she tells people I cheated, I could lose my scholarship. It's not just that. She knows other stuff about us too. Stuff that could never get out. That's why we need to set an example and scare her, so she keeps her mouth shut. So what are we gonna do? Stacey! Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Carver. You didn't tell me you were having company tonight? Oh, uh... I'm having company tonight. Are you planning on staying the night, Stacey? No. Uh, we're actually having a Bible study tonight. With our friends. Yeah, after our conversation last night, I just thought it'd be a good idea to have one. Well, that is a lovely idea, girls. Isn't it, Dean? It is. Did you want me to pop my head upstairs later and offer some words of guidance? Oh no, Father! I think you've given me enough advice. But thank you. Come on. Oh, and by the way, the rest of the girls are gonna be coming soon, so just make sure you send them upstairs. Next time, you should ask. I knew something was up. My journal was missing. And a Bible study group? That was a first. What in God's name are you wearing? Don't bring God into this. Your parents had no idea it was me. Okay, so... you know the plan? We're going to get wild tonight. And push her beyond her breaking point. Aubrey! Nice of you to join us. Grace, this is so great of you to put together. I'm honestly speechless. For once. Well, I... we... thought that this would be important. So why don't you take a seat? Before we begin, let's all join hands, close your eyes, and repeat after me. Somnus, spiritam, vocant. Somnus, spiritam, vocant. Somnus, spiritam, vocant. Somnus, spiritam, vocant. Somnus, spiritam, vocant. Stop. Wait. What's going on? This is a devil chant. The world is consumed with darkness at every path. So, tonight, we take on our own. I don't understand. What kind of Bible study is this? Ladies, it's time we take our sins to the next level. Aww! Aubrey, don't cry. This is a happy time. A time for bonding with your sisters. Don't scream either. Or we'll say this was all your idea. But... but... but... But, but, but, but? But what? Who are they gonna believe? You or me? The pastor's daughter? You know what they say about the boy that cried wolf, right? I thought this was a Bible study. Oh, my God, Aubrey, the Bible isn't even real. - Get a clue. - Yes, it is! Then who wrote it? Huh? You really think that there's a man in the sky? What's his name then? Jehovah in Hebrew. Yeah, I don't know about that. Yeah, who told you that? - The Bible. - And who wrote the Bible? People. Everyone. Enough! Enough, all right? We're not saying that we don't believe in the Bible, or God. We're not atheists. But we're not sheep either. So, let's begin. I want you to destroy something precious to someone. - No, no, no! - Give it to me! - No, no, no! - Give it to me! Don't! Stop! - Come on. - Stop! Much better. Okay. My turn. Hmm... Who gets to kiss me? What? That's not a part of the plan. I'm Lust, remember? Wow! That was so hot. Girls, do you want a jug of lemonade up there? - Shhh! - No, Mom! We're just in the middle of a verse! Don't get any ideas. You're next. Here, Aubrey. Take my daddy's hunting gun. No. That's dangerous. - Take it, Aubrey. - No, no. No. Take it! Pull the trigger. This isn't funny, Grace. Pull the fucking trigger! No! No! No! See. Empty. Got you! You think this is funny? No. Don't touch me. Strict parents create sneaky children, Aubrey. We are so sick and tired of being good little girls. I know I am. Don't you want to be bad for once in your life, little Aubrey? I'm going to let go. You tattle, and we're pinning this on you. Got it, Aubs? Remember. Loose lips sink ships. This meeting's adjourned. The gun should have scared me but I had to tell him what was going on. Who needs a savior when you have the Lord? Who knew I was in real danger? It's just high school after all. They did warn me... but I didn't see this coming. I guess I thought wrong. Weren't you warned? I'm pretty sure you were warned. I wasn't gonna say anything! - Liar! - I wasn't! What? You think I'm stupid? You liar! I wasn't! I swear! I wasn't gonna say anything! Okay, that's enough. That's enough. Get off of her! What is wrong with you? You were supposed to scare her, not hurt her! Shut up, Katie! She's gonna tell her parents! She's not gonna say anything. No, seriously guys, I can't get into trouble for this! What? Robyn, you were cheering her on!! Hey, enough, everyone. Stop it, okay? We can fix this. We just need to talk to her. Do you trust me? Guys... where'd she go? What do you mean, where'd she go? No, no, no, no. She's gonna tell. Guys, come on! Okay, everyone. Let's just split up, okay? Aubrey! Aubrey! Aubrey! Aubrey! Aubrey! Aubrey! Nothing? No. You? No. We have to go back. It's getting late. I mean, we can't just leave her here, Stace. Well, it's going to look more suspicious if we don't go back. Besides, she probably just went home. She's right. Maybe you took her, Grace. I'm sorry. What? Yeah. Is this just another one of your hazings? Does it look like a joke? Come on. get in. "No discipline seems pleasant at the time, but painful. Later on, however, it produces a harvest of righteousness and peace for those who have been trained by it." Hebrews 12:11. - Where were you? - Out. You know what? It doesn't matter. You disobeyed me, Grace. You're grounded. What a surprise! To your room. Now. And where did you get those clothes? The mall. You done fucked up, Gracie. You out there with worldly boys again? - Okay.

Pardon me, Ms. Sheila. Can't she tell how guilty they all looked? Would Katie Hamilton, Robyn Pearce, Tori Davidson, Stacey Rogers, Molly McIvor, and Grace Carver, please come to my office immediately. What do we do? Deny everything. It's her word against ours. - But Aubrey's... - Deny everything. Grace. Sheriff. Hi, Grace. Come on in, have a seat. Thanks for coming in, Grace. I'm sorry to tell you this, but Aubrey Miller, she went missing last night. Now I know you two are friends, and you girls tell each other things that you're probably not gonna tell your parents. But I was just wondering, maybe there's something that you can do or say that could help us with the investigation. Um, she's really sweet... and she loves God. Did you notice any suspicious behavior? Yeah. Was she sad? Or angry? No. I mean, school's always busy. And... uh... work. And Bible study. Aubrey is a very good student. There's been mention of her being distraught over a missing journal? Do you know anything about that? I think that's enough for today. Thank you for coming in, Grace. Stacey Rodgers. Hi. Aubrey Miller went missing last night. You girls talk to each other more than you would to your parents Aubrey is her best friend. No. Actually, Katie Hamilton is my best friend. Do you know anything that might have happened that could help us with the investigation? Anything at all? Uh-mm. Do you know... Now... Katie, it's your turn. Katie Hamilton. Hi, Katie. Shhh! Get out of here. Get out. Who would have done this? Get out! Where's Katie? She's late. She's getting her car detailed. - She said that it... - That's not a bad idea. I should probably do that too. They asked Grace about Aubrey's journal. Yeah, they asked me too. We need to figure this out before we get blamed for this. Girls. Did you guys find her yet? No. But thank you for being here to show your support. Where's the rest of your family? They're still looking for Aubrey. Which is what you girls should be doing. We're all just trying to stay really positive right now. Father, we pray for the safe return of Aubrey Miller. Help! Help! No! Coroner Feldman was the first to arrive on the scene. Katie's body was dumped by the swamp. They found a rose placed perfectly in her mouth. Sure is somethin', ain't it, Fred? Yeah. So, how's Maggie doin'? She still tryin' to get pregnant? Oh, man, she's really got him by the balls. Every time she's... uh... what's that word? Ovulating. She's gotta rush off and... Maybe your boys can't swim. ♪ Ring around the rosie ♪ ♪ Pocket full of posie ♪ ♪ Ashes, ashes... we all fall down ♪ It was a beautiful turnout for Katie. Everyone was still praying for me and my safe return. Well... almost everyone. Lord... make me an instrument of your peace. Where there is hatred... let me sow love. Where there is injury... pardon. I knew they felt sorrow. Guilt. I wanted them to feel more. I wanted them to feel love. Hope. Courage. I just wanted them to do the right thing. I'm now going to ask Mr. Miller to come up and share some words. To the Hamilton family, we are so very sorry for your loss. Please know that Katie will be deeply missed. And forever in our hearts. We know that Katie will watch over our little girl now. To bring her safely home. Aubrey's dedication to the Lord is strong. So let this be a warning. If you're here right now... whoever did this to our babies... rest not. For you should fear us. The authority. The Lord. Satan trembles when he sees God face to face. We will find you. Come out and show yourself! His wrath will show you no mercy. No mercy for the wicked. Gentlemen! Gentlemen! Please! I know you're angry and upset. Please sit down. Sit down! Who did this? Who did this to her? Who did this? These are challenging times. For our church. For our town. But trust that the Lord will see us through. Trust that.

I'm sorry we're late. We got hit pretty heavy today. This is the last of them. I can't imagine what those parents must be going through. First, Aubrey goes missing and then, Katie, dead. It's heartbreaking. I wish I knew them. Your friends. But I guess we all know everyone, don't we? On some level we're all connected. We truly are. And you know, sometimes they can even come back as something else. Like your friend Katie. If you see a butterfly, it might be her, you know? Andy, these are beautiful. No. That girl was a flower. Andy. What? You're under arrest for the murder of Katie Hamilton. What the hell's going on here? Fred, you take those cuffs off him right now. I'm sorry, Mags. My man is all good vibes.

Please, please, please, please, don't take him. Andy is Maggie's brother. Sheriff Middleton never really liked him. In fact, not sure if anyone from our town was really a fan. Except Grace. I don't think they expected this, though. How is she holding up? She's in shock. She must have straightened her bedsheet 25 times until it was perfect. Doug gave her a sleeping pill and... she's resting now. And the Hamiltons? Right. Yes. The Hamiltons... I told you I didn't want you working with that man, Grace. Look at what he's done!

So you think that if I prayed, we would find out who's doing this Well, you wouldn't have the wrong man behind bars, because Well, maybe we don't have... Thank you for your time, Pastor! - Brenda. - Good night. Wha... What do you mean, run away? Grace, that's insane. All of my friends are dying. And it's all my fault. It's not. It is not your fault. Girls. It's getting late. Actually, I think it is our fault. What is she talking about, Grace? Grace! Grace! - Grace, you're not leaving. - Get the fuck off me! You're not my fucking father! - Grace! You're not leaving! - Don't hurt her! Dean! You okay? Yeah, it's gonna be okay. - Are you sure? - Yeah, it's gonna be okay. So... We should go to Andy's. What? Yeah. He must know something. And he's the only one that's... No. No. No. No, Grace. That's not a good idea. They're going to think it was us. Why did you open your big mouth to my mom and my sister like that? Are you seriously gonna get mad at me right now? When this was all your idea in the first place? Yeah! And guess what? I'm trying to get us out of it, so if you just help for just once in your life, and just drive us to Andy's... then that would be great! - Noted! - Thank you! I mean, they're perfectly good fries. Fuck! Hello? Let's just go. He's not even here. I'll wait 'til he gets back then. Andy! It's Grace. Open up. Are you okay? It's been rough... but I'm doing okay. I'm so sorry... I think you'd better go. Sorry, Grace. The police told us not to talk to anybody until they sort this out. Do you know who did this? No. But whoever did do it, planned this whole thing out. They stole flowers from the shop... and there was citric acid and bleach found in her toxicology report. Bleach? Found in flower preserve... Baby. Look, we've said too much. - Wait! - Oh! - No. - No, no, no! Andy! Please... wait! Come on. He doesn't know anything. You got the rest of that Aubrey Miller file? No. Oh, but your friends are here. Howdy, Fred. You guys are a long way from the big city. How can I help you? Well, it's more like... we can help you. Yeah. See, we got a... we got a citizen's complaint from a, um... What was he, a general? Uhh... Pastor Carver. Pastor Carver. Yeah, he said there was some trouble in town, and the... sheriff couldn't handle it. So, when we found out it was you, we knew we had to come down here and clean it up. Clean it up? Listen, you boys. This is not your jurisdiction, so... Oh, hey, hey. Whoa! Whoa! Come on. You think we'd be here if it wasn't our jurisdiction? This is a joint task force now, Middleton. Captain's orders. Remember him? Apparently, the small-town pastor has some respect from the higherups. So, like we said... we came here to clean it up. Eh, if a fellow officer gets in trouble, we come down and help out. We got each other's back. Ain't that right, Zank? We stick together. Well, it's kinda hard to stick together when you're not taking advantage of the badge that's stuck to your chest. Jesus Christ, you're still singin' that tune, Middleton? Well, we both know that you were a shitty cop who did a shitty job. So, now you're in a shitty town, wearing a shitty uniform. You know what else is shitty? You're gonna screw up again. 'Cause that's what you do. It's your... it's your thing. You're a screw-up. So, this is what's gonna happen. You and your David Faustino, you know, look-a-like friend there, you're gonna be our go-fers. You're gonna get us what we need. And right now, I would like a coffee. Black. Uh, one vanilla creamer for me. We're waiting on reports from Coroner Feldman on the Aubrey Miller investigation. - We just think - There you go. Well, why don't we start there? Coroner Feldman. Thank you, Deputy Pikachu. Here's your Aubrey Miller case. They don't sound like friends. Who are they? My past. Are you okay? You're a real puker, huh? I puke when I'm stressed. Stress will kill ya. Hey. Breathe. Take three deep breaths. I'll do them with you, okay? Okay? One. Two. Three. We need to go back to the cabin. Now, would you just let us do our job? We can solve this case. The evidence in this case is laughable. What the hell is taking you so long to solve it? It's taking him so long 'cause he's the same dumbass cop now as he was then. He's a self-righteous prick. Hey, you know what? I don't care if y'all are from the big city. Sheriff Middleton... is great at his job, and he's one of the best men I know. What? It's gonna be good to see you shit the bed again, Middleton. Yeah, so let's get to Feldman's place, let's get the paperwork, so we can get the hell out of this shithole. Hey, Frodo. Now. - What the... - Don't scream. - Where am I? - Tell me your sin. - What? - Your sin. You know which one. The seven deadly sins? Say it. - Sloth. - That's right. Now say the rest. Why are you doing this? Tell me the rest of the sins. Lust... envy... ah! I told you not to scream. Hey, how's Maggie doin'? - She's good. - Oh, yeah? Haven't knocked her up yet? Nah, I'll tell you what. I'll knock her up, solve this case within an hour and have my secretary send you an invoice. Kind of like how you knocked up that prostitute? Did you invoice her? Feldman! Feldman, it's Fred. We got no service out here. Well, we've got no time for this. Zank. Wait a second. What are you doing? That's breaking and entering. You need a search warrant. Fuck that. Hmm. Let's go. Yeah, you do need a search warrant. That's weird. Sheriff? Yeah? Hey, Sheriff... That's the Carver cabin. Why does Feldman have these? It's Feldman. Hmm. Hey, O'Ryan, we solved another one. Let's go. "Deliverance of sinners from the penalty of their sin through their murder of the deity against whom they sinned." "The doctrine of Redemption is the fundamental mystery of our holy religions..." Good evening, Grace. Blessings to you. And who so believe in it, shall not perish, but have everlasting life. Aubrey? In spirit and in flesh. You thought I was dead, didn't you? You thought wrong. I guess that is exactly what I wanted you to think, Gracie. Aubrey, I'm so sorry. Come, boys, back to the station. Yeah, I don't think so. I think it's time you guys head back to the city. - What was that? - Breaking and entering? Really? How do you think the Captain's gonna like that? Why, you're just going to waltz right in there and tell him, huh? Come on, you got no proof. Get in the car. No, wait, wait. I think this may be proof enough. This goes away when you go away. Mall cops. You know, Middleton. Once a screw-up, always a screw-up. You and this town deserve each other. Yeah, we do. Douglas, you're a good cop. Thanks, Sheriff. So how are we getting back to the station? Maggie? What's your 10-4? You're probably wondering how I rose from the dead? And who better to help fake my own death than our own town coroner? You know Mr. Ernest Feldman from our church, right? No, I don't. Well, he works at the funeral home too. Decorates old people's faces. Knows his way around a dead body. Decorating people to make them look... presentable. You're fucking sick! I'm not sick. I'm pure. Now, since you read my journal, I'm sure you know the coroner was a sinner. Matthew 22:39. "Love thy neighbor as thyself." That's what the Bible says. Aah! Coroner Feldman was my neighbor. Turns out he was the biggest sinner of all. You're familiar with the seven deadly sins. Well, did you know about the eternal sin? It's the unforgivable sin. He who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit shall never be forgiven. I'm not a sinner. You think you'll be forgiven? This town though, on the other hand... I took it upon myself to cleanse it because your father clearly couldn't. That night, in the woods, after I escaped... the Lord spoke to me. He said it was my duty to reprimand you all for your sins. Feldman is next. He's a sinner in his own right. Then, there's your mother, Gracie. My God, isn't she a piece of work? Adultery to the first degree You'll never get away with this! Oh, I can, and I will. The roses were a nice touch, hmm. Easy to pin on Andy and that whack-job Summer. I mean, they deserve it for all of the drugs they do, and their belief in paganism and witchcraft. Please, forgive me. It's exactly what Jesus would do. Don't you dare bring the "J" word into this. He's not going to save you, Grace. I am. By cleansing you. Oh, and Feldman! And to think he was so closely involved with the church. Blackmailing him was a no-brainer. Not a step was missed in faking my death. I knew I needed him if I wanted this to work. No! No! We made a good team. I really did look dead with all that makeup. I wanted each death to be specific to the punishment for each sin. The color of the roses also. Kill you... kill you not... kill you... kill you not... kill you? Shut up. This is my favorite part. I didn't think you were this stupid, Gracie. Oh! You thought I was just some little Bible-thumper sheep, didn't you? Hmm? Shh. Someone you could control because you're so sick of being controlled, aren't you? You're right. You're right, Aubrey. - I'm so sorry. - Oh, don't beg. Don't beg. It makes you look fucking weak. You're Grace Carver. But I guess you're the sheep. - So that makes me... - the wolf. I'm the motherfucking wolf, Grace. I'm the wolf. And you know what happens to the wolf and the... I'm the fuckin' wolf. We're just wrapping everything up now, baby. Yes. I should be home in a couple hours. We got him. Do it. One... two... throw! She stays, you sit. Get over there. Alright, you're gonna say you did this. My father will... Your father will do nothing. You killed your friends. I will leave. I will take your pretty mom, and I will leave. You won't see us. Okay, let's just talk about this for a second. You don't know what she was capable of. She framed me. You read her journals, so you must know. Ernest Feldman. Drop your weapon. Drop your weapon now! I can't go in, Fred. They'll know. Ernie, look at me. Look at me! Ernie! Ernie! Come on, it's me. Hey, I need you to drop the weapon. - Fred! - Please. Okay? Just drop the weapon. Please. Oh, Fred! What did you make me do that for? Do it. And dump me in the lake. Do it! Shoot me! They can never know what I did. Do it. Please. You can never tell anybody. Yes. Yes. Sheriff? Sheriff! Sheriff! I need an ambulance up at the Carver Cabin. Now! Sheriff is down! I repeat, Sheriff is down! Sheriff? Come on! Come on! I'm bringing the Carver girl and her friend in for questioning. Love is patient. Love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast. It is not proud. It does not dishonor others. It is not self-seeking. It is not easily angered. It keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. But this story isn't about truth or love.
