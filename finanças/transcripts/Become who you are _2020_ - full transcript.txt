(SOFT MUSIC) SPEAKER: Two minutes, move the cars to the wall. Two minutes. (SOFT MUSIC) (SPEAKING FRENCH) It is now allowed to start the engines. One minute now, you can turn on the engine. NARRATOR: The time for waiting is over. The time for racing has arrived. SPEAKER: Green, Green, Green. NARRATOR: Mike Conway in the number #7 Toyota, sweeping around to lead the field down the Dunlop here for the first time. Gustavo Menezes right behind from fourth on the grid in the brightly colored car from Rebellion. SPEAKER: You are one of the quickest cars, on the sector 1 on track at the moment. (SOFT ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) Box and driver change. NARRATOR: First round of pit stops, and almost the entire field in in from GTE Pro. 92' Porsche that won last year in it's pinky pig is in. Ferrari in as well with both AF Porsche cars. Driver change. (ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) Battle in LMP2 and he goes by. So much top speed here at Le Mans. On that one lap we lose two percent of performance. SPEAKER: 4 lap to the next one Bruno. NARRATOR: Bruno brought the car in, a little bit early on his stint. SPEAKER: Oh, that's out. That car is out Porsche curves. ANNOUNCER: Attention debris early part of Porsche curves. It's just the 88 cars having a, it's struggle. (RADIO) In about 16 seconds we will go full course yellow ANNOUNCER: Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Full course yellow, full course yellow. I'm Scott Dixon originally from New Zealand, racing in America, also in the World Endurance Championship, 24 hour Le Mans. So Indycar season this year, and endurance races for the Ford GT program. (UPBEAT MUSIC) (SPEAKING PORTUGUESE) My name is Bruno Senna I am a professional driver Competing with Rebellion Racing at the 24 Hours of Le Mans (FANS CHEERING) (SPEAKING SPANISH) Hi, I'm Memo Rojas I am competing at the 24 Hours of Le Mans For IDEC Sport Racing (UPBEAT MUSIC) (SPEAKING FRENCH) My name is Jules Gounon I am a professional driver And I am going to take part at the 24 Hours of Le Mans For the really first time. To be for the first time in the parade, with so many people around, and the town which is really busy, you can really feel the atmosphere of Le Mans. (UPBEAT MUSIC) Le Mans is a, you know it's a special race that everybody wants to win. It's one of the three biggest races in the world. There's very few events around the world that have that status. The atmosphere is insane. I think for when you're performing at such at an event like that, it just makes you feel so good. (FANS CHEERING) (SOFT MUSIC) (DOOR OPENS) Ayrton was my uncle first, you know, a family member. Ayrton was also, you know, my example, my reference, because I really looked at everything he did, and I always tried to self learn and to see how he did it. Ayrton Senna was a Brazilian race car driver, definitely one of most accomplished drivers of his time. Any race car drivers dream would be to meet Ayrton Senna. I mean, it would be, I mean, bucket list, if you're possible. And of course, Bruno, being his nephew, had the ability to actually receive coaching from Ayrton Senna. (SPEAKING PORTUGUESE) For me it was really the way that he was able to teach without really trying to teach. You know, he was just so natural at like, I guess transmitting his values and the way and his way of life, that he didn't need to be like a boring teacher trying to tell you do this, do this, do this. He would just kind of come and show you what he was doing, and you'd go and you try it and you know, he would really try to make it a practical thing rather than just a lecture. (SPEAKING PORTUGUESE) And this was, this was a great thing because really, as a kid you want to do things. So you want to just experiment and experience. And I think he nailed it. (SOFT PIANO MUSIC) It's a dream come true. You couldn't learn from a better instructor. I mean, Ayrton knew everything there was to know about racing. Ayrton Senna was dominating in the 80s for sure. He was well known in the formula one world and racing in general. But on May 1st, 1994, Ayrton has a horrific accident. (CAR CRASHES) As soon as that happened, the subject and the motor racing became a bit of a taboo subject at home. (HIP-HOP MUSIC) From my perspective, Le Mans means a race that is, you know, one of the three or four largest races in the world. To me, it's a race that goes back to the beginnings of motorsport, where it pits manufacturer against manufacturer, proving who has the best car. Scott Dixon's a driver that came to us, you know, at the, at the wise age of 22-years-old I think. He's the leader of our team. It was just a natural progression to put him in the sports car team and as part of the Ford program. Competition just drives me and I think most of the others, and the adrenaline, what you feel and what you get out of it, the sensors and how they become enlightened. (ENGINE REVS) I will never forget that day as a seven-year-old kid getting into a go cart and being so low to the ground and feeling just that adrenaline rush. And how amazing it was at such a young age to be able to, you know, drive this powerful thing around, you know even, you know, it was only a little go cart. I started racing, go carts at the age of seven and just, you know, tried to hang on to that dream ever since of being able to drive things fast. I moved initially to Australia by myself at the age of 16. I lived in Melbourne for two years, and then you know that transitions to America, I was 18. For me, it was all about, you know, trying to win and to get to that next bigger category or bigger car. But it was all about the dream, it was all about the dream. You know, as I was, when I was a kid who was getting formula one, and then, you know, on the southern it was IndyCar. And once I saw my first IndyCar race, just the passion I had for IndyCar racing and how close and competitive and, you know, just for anybody in the field could win, you know, that really fascinated me. But it's kind of scary. I think thinking of my own children at that point, you know, maybe traveling halfway around the world and being on their own and maybe in that same situation. (CHILDREN SINGING) Tilly, Tilly what song is this one? (UPBEAT MUSIC) ♪ We're off to see the wizard ♪ ♪ The wizard, the wizard of oz ♪ ♪ We're off to see the wizard ♪ (CHILDREN LAUGHING) We do do something very dangerous. You know, it says it right on the back of the ticket that, you know, bad things can happen. He has the track record in that IndyCar of exceeding 232 miles an hour. Incredible. And of course at the same time, he has a family at home and bad things can happen at 232 miles an hour. You know we're quite spiritual people. So we're very much like you know what will be will be. And if you focus too much on that negativity, it can play a part in how you race. (UPBEAT MUSIC) NARRATOR: An un-believable atmosphere. A sea of faces, of smiles of hopes and dreams, awaiting the start of the toughest test in motor racing. (ENGINE REVS) Throughout the years, the cars have a evolved so much. They are faster, they have more down-force the technology has pushed the boundaries of the cars, and also the drivers. Every time a car goes faster it generates more G-forces, lateral forces that have an impact on the body. Driving a car at the limit for such a long period of time. It raises your heart rate for a long period of time. It's an average of 150 to 160 beats per minute, and you need to be very strong physically. You know, like anything these days, it's all about preparation. You know and I think you can't go in blind. I do, what I call I do the homework. You know, doing the homework is, you know, doing what you need to do in order to get an A on the following day. I really love to go on the bike cause you can really push yourself to the limit. Because you are the only limit on the bike. A bit like in the race car. In my case I practice a lot of boxing for this because the position of boxing, it's almost the same as the race car. You know, you're holding the steering wheel like this and the guard for boxing is like this, and you're using the same muscles. (SPEAKING SPANISH) People see the race car driver in the podium. You know, behind the wheel racing with the helmet. And people from the outside you know they look at it as a, you know, can be maybe a very glamorous position or, or a very exciting position. But the reality is that the sacrifice and the time consuming and the, all the requirements that and energy that you need to put in order to become a race car driver, it's enormous. As a driver, you have to be motivated to win. You know, this sport we're in is not called the 24 hours of Le Mans drive. It's called the 24 hours of Le Mans race. You have to want to win. To win, you have to be at the front. To be at the front, oftentimes you have to pass cars. And, so you need to be motivated to do that. No one's gonna hand it to you on a plate. You have to go take it. I train really hard all the winter, in just one target. One goal was to be ready at Le Mans. And when you're in the car and Mr Risi asks you to do a third stint and you see that you are able to do it. You're like, okay, I have trained hard, but I know for what. (SOFT PIANO MUSIC) To be able to do the 24 hour of Le Mans in 2019, it was something that I never thought about. Because obviously inside myself, I was always thinking about it. But I was so far from it. You know in 2014, I had a sickness on my legs on both legs. I had a surgery, I lost the sponsorship for the formula Renault. (SPEAKING FRENCH) Jules disease was compartment syndrome. It involves the muscles, and they're swelling to a point that they actually cut off blood flow and nutrition and oxygen. And it often happens to legs and arms and kind of extremities. And he pretty much lost all use of his legs. So that was that time that my father said, okay. I mean, I give you the chance as I ask him in go cart, you tried, it didn't work. You come back in the dealership in Aubenas washing cars. And when you are complaining every day about understeer oversteer and that you're coming to wash cars, and that your hand are burned by the product. I wanted to show to him that the real life for anybody which is working today. You can be a washer off cars, you can be a mechanic in my dealership. Obviously I didn't have so much problem in life, 'cause understeer and the overseer is something that people would dream about. When anything happens to an athlete, it's very difficult for that athlete. It's a totally life changing event. And to a race car driver, I mean, there's nothing like driving a car. (ENGINE REVS) NARRATOR: Into hour two of this year's 24 hours of Le Mans. Trouble for Bruno Senna in the Rebellion. A looping spin, just avoids the barriers. Yeah, it's a very complex situation, when you have any tires breaking or anything, any kind of failure in the car. Especially in Le Mans, because the track is so long, you have to re-nurse the car back to the pits. NARRATOR: Back into the pit box goes the Rebellion number one car. Sixth place in the LMP-1 class. Andre Lotterer is strapped in as they continue with repairs. When I became 18 years old, my mother came to me and asked me what I wanted to do with my life, and I said, yeah, I'd like to maybe go back to racing. She's like this guys a kid. You know he's 18-years-old, he's a boy racer. Go get the go cart from the farm, like one of the old ones and see what happens. And that's when it all kicked off. (UPBEAT MUSIC) Can anything stop you from becoming a race car driver? If you truly want to be one, no, nothing can stop you. You will race anything. You'll race, go cart on the weekends, a shopping cart in the driveway. I mean anything you'll race it, and then it'll snowball into back into racing without a doubt. It's such a strong thing that wants, that you need to go racing. Obviously you know everybody wants to allow each one of us to become what we are and, you know, be successful in whatever we decide to be. And, you know, follow your dreams. We know at the same time that motor racing is very dangerous, and we lost Ayrton some years before. I was at home with my family, we were watching the race in Sao Paolo, and we saw the accident on TV. We've seen him crashing before, so it was not something that you necessarily think is going to be bad, but that one looked pretty bad to be fair. The whole family was watching it. I mean, it was on TV, it was televised. And every racetrack, whenever there's a crash, the TV zooms in it. And so when it's a horrible outcome, like it was, it's out there and everyone's watching it. They're glued to their TVs. They're helpless. They can't do anything. So Bruno was one of those people. As soon as that happened, motor racing became a bit of a taboo subject at home. And it was quite tricky to, you know, to just to approach the subject. So for many years we couldn't say anything. And I guess, because I didn't say anything, I felt bad of course. My family's supposed that I was completely over it. It was a big impact in the family, because what would be the best choice, you know, to let him go or not to let him go because of that so. All drivers clearly understand the danger, and they respect the danger. You can understand something, you can respect something, but you can also push it on the side. But I think to completely push it on the side, you have to know all sides of it. And I think that's what, that's what the great racing drivers are able to do. They understand all sides of the danger, and therefore they can push it aside. (ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) At the end of the day, you know, the passion and it's difficult to explain the passion until you live it. The passion for motor sports, I would say it's in the blood. Oh, I wish I could say that. It's a genetic thing, I don't know if it is. But maybe it could be nurture, maybe it could be nature. Who knows what's the reality. But in the end, it was because I just wanted to go racing. I loved it. Of course the family side was difficult. But I knew that with time, if everything was going well, people would understand it. (ENGINE REVS) When I was a kid, you know, my dad was my hero. I remember when he would dress up with a racing suit, as a race car driver. It was for me like a Superman putting his, his costume you know. Most most of my memories since I was a child, were with my father at the racetrack. With my brother, we would typically, you know, play football or soccer behind the paddock while my dad was racing. If I hadn't seen my dad race when I was a kid, I am not sure if I would have been a race car driver. You know, I fell in love with the sport because I was exposed to it. Family, I think is how most, you know, drivers start in racing. You know, it's not a typical ball and bats kind of sport. You know, you can't just go and play it at school. I grew up listening to stories of my dad in Le Mans, and my dad raced in a time where they didn't have the chicanes at Le Mans. So, you know, the straightaway was, I think it was more than two kilometers long. And at that time, you know, they were achieving speeds closer to, close to 400 kilometers per hour. Following my father footsteps you know has been, you know, quite a challenge, especially because that meant trying to achieve my dream of becoming a race car driver. I started racing cars when I was 10-years-old. I started with the help from my dad. And we had no sponsorship, and my dad was my mechanic. Everything was done between myself and my dad. We would have to carry the go cart to every race. Racing in Mexico, it was like really old school I would say like. Sometimes if you go off the truck, you would hit a tree and not a barrier. So it was like this. I remember the first days we didn't this all technology and tools and people helping us. Only, you and me and somebody else helping us, and our truck. I've enjoyed the ride. Le Mans is one of the races, toughest races in the world. To have a son racing in Le Mans is like a continuity of what I started. Box this lap please Memo. Box box this time. Box and driver change. You know when the race started we discovered that we were loosing 10 second per pit stop, in the refueling of the car. SPEAKER: Two laps to go Memo. It was a problem that was not possible to fix during the race, so we had to stick with it. I don't have fuel. I don't have fuel. SPEAKER: Okay are you moving or are you stopped? I am moving, I'm near the box, I barely made it. What the fuck. As you know, it's 24 hour race. You know, there's more than 30 pit stops. And the team calculated that we ended up losing close to seven minutes. You know, we lost any opportunity to fight for the win. When you make your mistake, you cannot fix it. That's the problem, that's why it's very frustrating. It's, you just have to adapt yourself during the race and just go to the end and we're all doing a lot of mistake. Of course mistakes can happen at any point. And they can have huge consequences, even though it's a little mistake or a big mistake. I was fighting for the championship in 2016, in German championship, with Corvette. Last race of the season P2 in the championship fighting for the lead. NARRATOR: Let's go green and let's go racing. The final race. And yeah, that's a hard part for me, 'cause I was fighting, I think 10 minutes to go. And in the car was fighting was the Lamborghini, which had an issue on the speed there. So I couldn't take flats on the fast corners 'cause it was losing the downforce. But I remember turning and I was already thinking about going to overtake him. A few laps, I was fighting on him, couldn't pass him, and suddenly I saw him lift. NARRATOR: My goodness me. The drama could not get any greater. Jules Gounon is out. We were traveling at 235, 235 kilometers, which is really fast that corner, and I couldn't avoid him. I really had that moment where I felt in slow motion. I really saw the wall and like. And I really remember myself just going really hard to try to save my life. And obviously after that, I don't remember. We're in a dangerous sport. But we are professionals, we're athletes. We know how to execute exactly what we need to execute. Those things still happen. You just don't have control over them. So you don't think about them and hope they never happened to you. We are on the cusp of grip of that car. So the littlest thing can throw you into the wall and you just hope it never does. Honestly first when I saw the crash. The speed, the door, the crash was on the east side doors. For me it was, it was finished. Also I was in the paddock and I was cruising and waiting, because I had to wait to go to the medical center. For me it was finished. NARRATOR: So medical team down there attending to Jules Gounon. And there, Daniel Keilwitz, looks on with anxiety. In my mind it was that it was, perhaps he's not there anymore. But at the end where he wanted to be: racing, and his life is like that. It was terrible, but on the other side, he was where I wanted to be, also Short life but a fantastic life, is better than long life with regrets. When I wake up, I had the door handle, which was in my leg. I looked in my leg full of blood, and I'm like, look at myself. Okay, I can move. I'm not dead. Or maybe I am, but I can still move. So it's a good sign. It was a life changment for me. 'Cause you can feel that in one second you can pass away. And yeah, that's the part of our job, our risk. Sometimes when things like this happen, you're reminded that you're still doing a dangerous sport. And sometimes to keep yourself motivated, after things like this, it's difficult. (SPEAKING FRENCH) It too me a month before being capable of watching the video on YouTube because I didn't want to see. It was too violent. NARRATOR: Jules Gounon, being taken away. (SPEAKING FRENCH) When an accident happens, Each time you re-evaluate the risk But you cannot avoid it. I don't want to die in a race car, but if one day I die on it, I will have lived my best life. (EPIC MUSIC) (RADIO ANNOUNCER) (ENGINE REVS) NARRATOR: Laurens Vanthoor, sticking to the leader. Chase for third though the Corvette is down to fourth place, up to third, as gone the 93 Porsche, that's Earl Bamber, as darkness starts to form. Daddy! Hello. You're home. (CHILDREN LAUGHS) How was school? Good. How was your race? It was okay. The best part is being able to come away from a race weekend, whether it was a great race weekend or a bad one, and come home and just snap out of racing life. And, you know, play with barbies and horses and, you know, just have fun with my kids or play a board games. So you guys are going to cook me dinner right? Yeah. Well what are we having. No, 'cause mom cooked already. That's how you pay for dinner. What are we having? When he comes home, I think it gives his mind and his body a chance to just enjoy life, and I think that's why it's so good for him. He's my husband first, and then the dad and then the race car driver. I'm immensely proud of the person that he is. He's an amazing dad, and he's very much present when he's home. Which is nice, 'cause it is hard to turn off, you know, if you're so focused. But when we're home we're with the dogs, we're with the kids. For me, I think it's really helped me mentally to not get drained or over complicate things or overthink things on the racing side. Because it's very easy to do that. (UPBEAT MUSIC) (CHILDREN LAUGHING) When he starts the race season again, come March, he's ready and he's refreshed. And I think, I think that's a real winning factor for him is that he can have the best of both. Like any marriage we, you know, add to each other's lives. I think why me and Scott have got so lucky is that with my background, I've been a sports person for quite a long time. You know, I went professional with my sport at 14. So I knew the commitments involved in a sporting career. So what I can bring to Scott, not that I need to bring very much 'cause he's an incredibly focused athlete anyway. But I can concentrate on the nutrition. We concentrate on the training and that's where I think I can help him, you know, in the sense that I understand to get to the top. You know, you have to remain very focused. (CHILDREN LAUGHS) It's the perfect combination. You know, it's, I'm lucky enough that, you know, Emma, my wife and and Poppy and Tilly are able to come to probably half the races. Emma, maybe a little more than, than half. You know, it's tough with schooling, especially at this age now, too. But for me, you know, family is everything. We'll just got here. I think you've got to write these out. No, can you just type the please send. This one I got a four. EMMA: Nice. Scott, off the track is a championship driver. He's a great family man. He's a great father. So he understands the whole package of what it takes to be a driver. And when you understand the whole package of being a driver, that's the first step to becoming a championship driver. I do feel like we're such a team, you know, it works really well, and Scott actually loves to have the girls at the track. When the engine starts and the race begins. Every driver has a particular look in their eye when it comes to racing. When he goes out the door, it's, he's all focused and really consumed with the racing. I don't believe that someone with a family is thinking about the family and the risks that they're putting themselves in that weekend. Otherwise they probably wouldn't continue being a race-car driver. 'Cause there are other opportunities to do things on those weekends. But since they're gifted individuals that know how to race well, they step in that car collectively and they pilot that car beyond its ability every single day. Of course, I'm bias, but I do think he's one of the greatest drivers of all time.

Did you catch the safety car yet Memo? MEMO: No I'm behind the GT Cars. I can't see the driver get out of the car so, it's one of the SMP cars. It gets to a point where you, you lose perspective on how fast you go, and you don't realize how fast you're going until you have an accident. NARRATOR: Rojef drops a wheel onto the grass at the beginning of the Porsche curves and a high speed off. There's a huge amount of damage to the car that was in third place overall. (ENGINE REVS) When I took the decision to be a race car driver, my life changed. Literally every decision I took was taken based on how can I achieve my goal of being a race car driver. When you're going through the junior categories, you kind of, you're living the dream right. You know especially at the young age of seven through to say 15, you're constantly thinking, is this a reality. You know, yeah, it's going to happen, it's going to happen. You kind of just think it's going to happen. But you know, the stress that it had on my family. You know, each year, my dad trying to, you know, round up the funds or the money to try and make it possible, was something I was very naive to. I didn't really understand it. Didn't, you know, want to know about it. All I wanted to do was race and drive. But I think as you go through those categories, you start to understand like, hey we're doing pretty well here. But each year was a make or break year. You know, could you continue on. Family effort was put into my career, and I will be grateful to my family forever. But as my career, eh, got down the road, there was nowhere I could keep going because the budgets were getting higher and it was difficult to go to the next level. And Telmex created the driver development program called Escuderia Telmex, which, you know they recruited some of the best Mexican talent, and they gave us a chance in the best categories. And ever since then, you know, my career took off. I have a chance to meet Memo when he was very young. He was starting his career in motorsports. And I think sometimes timings are very important. Just when he was starting to look for his international development. The team was being built together with other sponsors. So it was a very nice coincidence that things happened in that way. What would be your plans for next season? What are you thinking about next year? You know, Carlos I think, you know since we won four championship in IMSA, and we won Daytona 24, we won Sebring 12 hours. The next race to have the triple crown of endurance racing, would be the 24 hour of Le Mans. So I think for you, for Telcel for Telmex, to have the triple crown would be a massive achievement. Memo wants to achieve Le Mans 24 hour win. He has a Daytona 24 hour win, he has a Sebring 12 hour win. And if he wins Le Mans 24, who knows what he'll do, he would be a triple crown winner. We've achieved so many successes together with Telmex program and with the help of great teams that I've been at, like Chip Ganassi Racing. I won Daytona 24, three times. Memo Rojas is a driver that came to us from Mexico and was a proven winner in Mexico already. We have many, many wins with Memo. He was a professional and the cream rose to the top. When it was time to perform, he performed as a racing driver there at Daytona, and it was glorious to win that race with him. Once you get the chance to prove yourself and to perform, and you have the support of sponsors. Then you know even though the budgets are bigger, it kind of becomes easier because now you have a name. Now you proved yourself. Racing is very expensive on someone, either the team, the driver, the car owner, the team owner. And the Escuderia Telmex really allowed Memo to break out of Mexico and allowed him to race. Obviously his skill plays a factor in that, a large factor in that. But unless you have funding behind you, you're not going anywhere. He was the first driver within the team that went to Europe. Having the combination of young talents being attached to the image of our country, together with the development of motor sport, is a very strong combination. (PEOPLE CHEERING) (SPEAKING SPANISH) At the end of the day, we are here because we want to win this. It's been a long road, 27 years behind the wheels, since I was a little kid. Yeah, you could say, I am obsessed with it. But still even after winning Daytona three times, the dream of Le Mans seems to be a far far thing. (UPBEAT ROCK MUSIC) SPEAKER: Radio check Memo. MEMO: Copy radio check. SPEAKER: three to go Memo. Three to go. For info, you are the second fastest average on this stint on track at the moment. (UPBEAT ROCK MUSIC) Light rain reported Dunlop and Tertre Rouge. Pit this lap Bruno, pit this lap for fuel only. I'm really proud of being related to Ayrton. You know, it's something that I'm sure that a lot of people would like to be as well, you know, to have known him personally, and to have experienced so much with him. He was a massive family guy. You know he just loved being with the family. He enjoyed pranking us all the time, making jokes. And it was really funny because at the same time it was super cool being with him. It was a little bit tense because you never know when you're going to be throwing the water, or when you're going to get like some pepper thrown on your food. So it was a lot of fun. You know, as a kid, you always enjoy that sort of stuff. I think Ayrton would be very happy to come racing in Le Mans. I would love, absolutely love to have him as my teammate. Although I think if we would go for the, if there's a gap, you have to go for it every single time. Maybe he's not going to finish Le Mans on the first time, but he'll learn very quickly with it. Yeah, he'll be the ultimate teammate I think. He was absolutely amazing on the race track. He was the fastest guy out there. Well, I think Ayrton was and still is a huge example for us, for all the family. We lost our father very early. One year after Ayrton's accident. Obviously because Bruno is also a racing driver. He has a person, a driver to look up to. This is the 25th anniversary of Ayrton's death, and we've, you know we tried to keep his memory alive to people as much as possible, and this year. I'm going to drive his 88' McLaren, the car he won his first formula one title with. (ENGINE REVS) Is there anyway we can trim the pipe a little higher? If there's a way we can trim it, a little bit higher so it doesn't fall? People really love Ayrton. I think it's because Brazilians really miss having someone that's world-class like Ayrton was, but also an example of a human being. (ENGINE REVS) Life can be very difficult in Brazil. You have, in Brazil you have all the extreme, all the extremes. You have the fantastic nature. You can have all the good material things that money can buy. But at the same time, you have lots of problems, social problems and poverty, some violence as a consequence. I tried to help a little bit for children particularly. The way our family decided to react after the accident, we had two choices. You know, to just feel pity for ourselves and, you know, to lose such a nice person or showing the importance that he had for so many people. How could we leverage that to one of his dreams, which was, you know, to give opportunity to so many children and youngsters in Brazil. And we decided to take the second choice. The biggest tool you can have, and nobody can take away from you is to be knowledgeable, to be educated, to have maths language skills in general. To become what you want to become. Hi, welcome to the Ayrton Senna Institute. This is the heart of all the work you do for the children in Brazil. And there's so many interesting things here. So I'm going to take you for a walk. Here we have a race worn helmet, his boots, his gloves. So here in the foundation we have so much stuff that belonged to Ayrton that brings his amazing inspiration to everybody that works here. Senninha is our cartoon character. It's was created by Ayrton when he was still alive, and he wanted to, you know, transmit his values and the good things for the kids. Senninha is a brand now, it's 100% owned by the foundation. So every dollar made by the Sunninha brand goes straight to the foundation. So it's a great way for revenue to be created. The foundation is the only non-university or non-governmental institution in the world to hold a chair at the UNESCO knowledge creation institutions. Which is a real achievement, when you consider that is, you know, something that operates and to just give children opportunities in Brazil. Bruno is for sure living up to the Senna legacy. He has the last name, I mean, huge shoes to fill, and he's doing a really great job. But it's really only that, it's a legacy. These guys are still performing at such a high level. They still have to train. They still have to have the skills. They still have to have the mindset, and then they have to go and execute it. That moment when I saw Ayrton lifting this trophy up with even when he had no energy left on him. It made me inspired to, you know, always try and beat the limit, try to be the best version of myself. (UPBEAT MUSIC) (SPEAKING AT THE RADIO) NARRATOR: Aston Martin 95 is off. That is a really fast accident turning in flat out in top gear, the car just spins. (UPBEAT MUSIC) Full service fuel driving change and fresh tires. Warning for track limits at Tertre Rouge For your information (UPBEAT MUSIC) Sunday morning and hundreds of thousands of fans awake at 7:30 in the morning with Jose Maria Lopez, leading for Toyota, G-drive in charge in LMP-2, Corvette in GTE Pro. All cars have four wheels. Some have the engine in the front, some have the engine in the back, some have the engine in the middle. But they're all connected to the track with four patches of rubber. And, Scott has great ability to manage those four patches of rubber that are touching the surface. So it sort of doesn't matter what car he's in. He understands the, what it takes to make a car fast. It's definitely my strong suit is being able to adapt to different cars or maybe just getting on with it, opposed to trying to pick apart what needs to make it better. So that's also my downside is that instead of trying to make the car better, I would just try to drive around it. Whether he's in an Indycar, whether he's in a Ford GT, he just gets in, he drives, figure out what the car needs, and he does it and he just makes it happen. I think every time he gets in a car, there is, you know, there is that little thought in the back your head, like, please don't let it be my go. Please bring him home. Like there is that side of it. But once the race starts, I'm just wanting him to like do really well. So yeah, the fear factors is there. But I think you have to push it out of your mind. Scott Dixon is a very talented driver in all race cars. And some things are out of your control, and the worst could have happened at the Indy 500 in 2017. We started on the pole, car was pretty good. We slipped back, I think a couple of spots. And then we actually ran probably I think, for a stint, a stint and a half. Made some changes to the car, we're coming back through the field, and could kind of see going down the front straight that people are starting to slow down a little bit. Kind of see there was a car offline a little bit. Didn't think too much of it. You know, it's quite typical in Indy 500. You know, the closing rate can be quite quick when you're doing 230 miles an hour. And then unfortunately just out of the, you know, corner of my eye I could see the car touched the wall. And then at that point, your, you know, still at 230 miles an hour, and you gotta make a very quick decision of which way to go. And typically if a car's kind of against the wall, it's gonna stay against the wall, especially, you know, with the speed and how it pushes out. But unfortunately with how, you know, Jay's car hit the wall it then turned directly left right in the pathway. And at that speed, you just really can't change, you know, your direction too much. And I tried to stop hit Jay, and it went up into the air, probably I think about 30 feet into the air. COMMENTATOR: No! Oh my goodness. One car airborne, it's Scott Dixon. He makes contact with the 77 of Jay Howard, who got up and out of the curve. Dixon came down to the bottom of the racetrack to try to avoid Howard. When he made contact that car went airborne. I remember kind of looking down 'cause it's started to flip, and I was like, wow, I'm very high up here this is gonna hurt. Then the car actually tilted the other way, hit the inside wall. Just remember hearing the engine, you know, screaming. Oh my God, that moment I literally, I had my headphones on and I just remember like throwing them, you know, like. Because I'm so used to hearing Scott when he's had a crash come straight on radio and tell his team I'm good, I'm good. You know, 'cause they want to know straight away. But you couldn't hear anything. (RADIO ANNOUNCER) In that moment I thought the worst, you know, 'cause he didn't speak. All I remember is looking up and seeing basically a half of a car sitting on the outside of the track, and I was like, oh I hope that person's okay. And kind of checking my body and oh my leg hurts a little bit, getting out. And then looking back at the car and seeing that, you know, half the car was missing. NARRATOR: The entire rear of Dixon's car is removed. But thank the good lord Scott Dixon is moving around in that cockpit. There is nothing left of that automobile. Our pole sitter Scott Dixon again made contact with the 77 of Jay Howard. Sometimes, you can't help what happens, you know, you got to just trust that everything's gonna be okay. It's funny how, you know, you kind of react in moments like that. You know, for me, I felt like the car was a race winning car. You know, we hadn't started the race balanced wise exactly where we want it to be, but we were starting to move back through. You know, what kicks in straight away was just, I can't believe I'm out of the race. You know, I was angry because I was out of the race. You know, you don't automatically think. It's kind of weird in those situations. I think sometimes you almost think you're indestructible and I don't know why that is or what, you know, powers that. But once the adrenaline kicks in, you know, for me, it was just pure anger to start with. Which, you know, I should be thankful that I was okay and able to stand up and walk away. The greatest memory I have of Scott is when he emerged from the hospital. Came walking out of the hospital about 10 minutes later, he said, Hey man, he goes, is our car okay for Detroit? Which was the following race. He says, our car okay for Detroit? I said, yeah. He said, okay, I'm fine. And it, you know, and that's kind of his attitude is, you know, he sort of brushes off the, the speed bumps, if you will. He brushes off the speed bumps and then looks forward. And you know again that's part of understanding what it takes to be a championship driver. NARRATOR: Very good morning to you, just after nine o'clock here at Circuit de la Sarthe. 18 hours done at this year's race, that means six hours still to go. SPEAKER: The last lap was very good. It was climbing pass the chicane down Mulsanne. Every race has its challenges and they all require preparation. As drivers, you do the best you can to prepare yourself, and that includes some psychological training. The driver mentally prepared for a 24 hour race, many weeks in advance, really. But it's a mental state of just knowing how well, you know, you can perform. The whole weekend, the second you leave your house. Every moment you're trying to be the fastest guy there. The fastest time, fastest top speed. NARRATOR: Car going very rapidly further down in the category is the IDEC Sport Racing. You need the fast drivers to win races because everybody's pushing so hard. But I guess really is to understand, and to have a free mind as you're driving. When you're racing, you cannot think of anything else, but what's going on in front of you. It pulls everything out of your mindset. You're physically demanded. You're mentally demanded. There's no, in no way, can you think of something else. The championship winning drivers that we've had have had a clear focus, a clear focus, a clear goal and a clear attitude to perform at the highest level. (SPEAKING FRENCH) I do think that Jules has A very impressive mental strength. Since he was very young He told me: "Mum, I want to win Le Mans". And I said: "You will win it if it's what you want Or at least, you will do your best to achieve it." To say that to your son will be a racing driver or will be good racing driver is not for sure, you know. It depends of the talent of the guy and the motivation of the guy. (SPEAKING FRENCH) There a a lot of factors in this job There is the speed The precision The stakes There is a lot of pressure, and he is able to manage that. I do a lot of golf 'cause there is something that is really, for me. Helping me to stay calm in the race car, to make the right decision. As you have to do on the golf course, every shot is important. You don't have to lose your focus for three, four hours a bit like in a race car. The sun is just hitting you. You cannot do anything about it. But you just try to get acclimated with it. And when you have that heat, like in a race car, around 60, 65 degrees, it's really helpful. When can I put the AC on again? Probably not for three laps, for three laps. In the golf, you're gonna have one shot, and that shot is going to determinate, all the things that coming after. In the car, it's the same when you are taking a decision in your race car, it's going to give a lot of consequences. Motor sports is a very mental sport. It's a precision sport and the mental health of the driver you know, it's very important. You know we take decisions at 200 miles an hour. Mentally preparing yourself absolutely helps make the right decision in the car. When you're mentally prepared, you're on the top of your game. So your reflexes are much quicker. Your decision making skills are better. Ultimately you know when I'm racing now, I'm trying to think of taking an advantage of the situation, rather than giving everything at every single moment. And I mostly keep myself out of trouble. Normally my stints are good because I'm able to deal with traffic well from just kind of judging the best way to deal with traffic. In my case, part of my, the way I attack a race like that is you always gotta think you can win. (ENGINE REVS) Many people ask me, how does it feel to drive at night or three, four, 5:00 a.m.? And you know, typically the, you know, the adrenaline level is, you know, it's pumping the whole race. It's difficult to get sleep. But also you don't really get tired until the next day. The track starts to get warm again. So you start to feel the heat of the, of noon, that is tough on the body. And you've already done, I dunno, 18 hours of racing. And that's where your body kinda starts to send a signal that this is tough. But you know, we work hard for it. We prepare ourselves and mentally you, you know, you extract every bit of energy that you have, you have inside. (ANNOUNCER SPEAKING) SPEAKER: Driver change. We have a 10-second penalty to serve for slow zone, full cause yellow violation. The race is seen from Mexico, as you know. Something really far difficult to achieve, and Mexico is a country that it's in, in need of, of good examples of success. It's a country that has great people, but they also have a lot of troubles and people need the inspiration. At least I try with what I do in motor sports to inspire people, for people to know they can achieve their dreams at any level. Not only locally, but also internationally. I've been able to lift the Mexican flag many times in the podium and that's been great. And when we do this, it's always front covers in the newspapers. (SPEAKING SPANISH) Here we are back in Central Fox Nitro And we are pleased to introduce you To one of the great figures of the 24 Hours of Le Mans. The great Mexican champion Memo Rojas. Hi Memo, how are you? It's a pleasure to be here, thank you for the invitation. It's our pleasure. Memo, Mexico has a great tradition In the 24 Hours of Le Mans, for many reasons. For the Rodriguez Brothers, For all the heritage that has been there. At the 24 Hours at the La Sarthe racetrack. The important thing is not to win Le Mans But for Le Mans to let you win the 24 Hours. Is that true? That sentence you've just said, Was one of the first thing that I heard about Le Mans. Is that Le Mans chooses you You don't win Le Mans, Le Mans chooses the winner. NARRATOR: Good afternoon, everybody, as we heard towards the last three hours sprint to the flag. (DRILLING TIRES) (SPEAKING SPANISH) Nyck de Vries straight off in the barrier. Racing Team Nederland they can't believe it. That is straight off the car, did not steer. (SPEAKING FRENCH) Driver change, 63 car, the remaining car is still in victory contention. Unbelievable heroics from Nyck de Vries after the car was dragged out in the gravel, he's got it back into the pit. And now there's trouble for Corvette. Jan Magnussen is off in the Porsche Curves. So many people have made the same error. Does he avoid the wall? No. And that might spell the end of any hopes of a yellow car winning this race. I guess in endurance it really makes a difference not to be one of those people that crash a lot. I think there's only so much room for having accidents when you're in endurance racing, no matter how fast you are. The prototypes are, they are almost like a bigger single seater. They are heavier of course, but they are extremely fast on the straights. In a certain way we have similar amount of performance on the corners. They are very, very aerodynamic cars. But, single seaters they feel lighter and nimbler. Prototypes they're still a little bit heavier, a little bit more built for endurance rather than, than sprint racing. Although having said that we have 24 hours of pushing every lap. It's not like the old days where the cars are the reliability issues. Now the cars are so strong you can just really push every lap, And it feels like, it feels like a long sprint race. Going back to Monaco is, from a busy race, from busy schedule that I have is actually almost like coming back to a holiday place in a certain way. It's a beautiful place so I can enjoy, you know, just looking at the sea, so peaceful, having, you know, a sunset. It's a place where I can really discharge and recharge again with the energy for next big round of travel and events. I'm very proud to be, an ambassador for McLaren Automotive. We just recently unveiled the McLaren Senna, which is an amazing piece of engineering. But also a great tribute to Ayrton. Ayrton always wanted to make a car with his, with his name on it. And I guess McLaren couldn't be any better of a partner. They are really the best partner we could find for sure for this. I went to the design studio to see what they were up to there, and this car was in the clay. So it was like the very early stages of development and they gave me the brief of the car, what you're supposed to be, what you're supposed to represent. And this was supposed to be the most track-focused car McLaren has ever made for the road. It's super light, super powerful, massive downforce. So massive performance figures for a road car. Making an iconic road car with Mclaren really helped so much to keep Ayrton's memory, his image and his legacy alive. Being part of this development was a real, a real high point in my career for sure. (EPIC MUSIC) It's a special car from many, many perspectives for me. I think, you know, it's hard to put a description on the feeling of having, of owning this one. Because it's a rare car. It's a real special car. It carries, of course my family name on the back. I don't think many people can say that, apart from Ferrari. But you know, it's really an achievement. I'm very fortunate to have been part of development of other McLaren cars, but this one is particularly special in my heart. So I'm sure that this will be in my garage forever. (ENGINE REVS) Ford decided to come back into endurance racing with the Ford GT program. And they joined forces with Chip Ganassi and a very fast raced team, and as well as very fast drivers. To be a part of, you know, 12 drivers that were lucky enough to be part of that lineup. You know, I think this is was very special. But you know, it's the track, it's the speed. It's the, you know, the cool cars, it's the atmosphere. It's the people. It's just everything. Well, certainly to be chosen by Ford, to be the team to run the car is, was really an honor. It meant a lot to Ford motor company in 1966, and it meant a lot today as well in 2016 when we were there. With what Ford did with that whole program, you know, through the course of those four years. What manufacturers bring as far as pushing the boundaries to try and go back 50 years later to replicate what they did in 1966, is that just that concept is cool to be a part of. (SPEAKING FRENCH) Chip Ganassi's goal with the Ford program, has got to be just to win. Do they want to repeat what happened before? Of course they wanted to win again. They wanted to dominate just like they had before. Every weekend we go to the racetrack, it's about winning. You know that's why we're in this sport. If you're not winning, I wouldn't have a job. I was doing okay when I was behind their Porsche. You know, I really admire Chip and his push to be the best. Scott Dixon's second home is Chip Ganassi's race shop. He's been there since he's 22 and that's where it's cars prepared, that's where their fitted for him. That's where all the weights are done with him inside the car. Welcome to the Chip Ganassi racing workshop. This is where we do the IndyCar program, and to the Ford GT program right now. Le Mans 24 is absolutely won at Le Man in France. But where does it start? It starts back at every race car driver's home, at all the race shops. There are hundreds of people working on all of these cars. Chip Ganassi is an extremely accomplished race team. So they keep everything in house. They have their IndyCar program and their Ford GT program all under the same roof, working with all the same guys and the same machines. It is a equation that they know how to win. And so they keep it within that equation and they do a really good job of it. Lots goes on. You know there's a lot of a, this is where everything is kind of coming and going and getting prepped for for the season. But it's always nice to see some of where the team started and some of the significant, well iconic races that they've won throughout. After every win we do a picture with a plaque that has the winning driver and the chassis number and the date, and what race track, we won the race at. The pictures go all the way around the building, come back up. This is our, our second roll of pictures, and it goes back around and there's over 200 pictures on the wall right now. But yeah, I've been lucky enough to be part of the 100th win celebration, which was in Nashville I believe. And then the 200th win, which we got was it was last year I think Daytona? We won in Daytona in the Ford GT program with Richard and Ryan. So what makes Scott Dixon special is first and foremost, he knows how to win races. Couple that with there are a lot of drivers that know how to win races. Not a lot of drivers know how to win championships. So there's a difference there. Scott knows how to win championships. We used to have a driver named Alex Zanardi that was very similar to Scott and Zanardi would say Chip, he'd say, I need to know when to go, and I need to know when to whoa. And I think Scott is the same way. He knows when to push and when not to. So I think, I think that's something that a championship driver and that's a quality that a championship driver might have. Having an athlete that you're like-minded brings a lot with that. A lot of that congruency is the foundation for speed and for success and for wins. (UPBEAT MUSIC) NARRATOR: LMP2 battle. For the lead, G-Drive versus Signatech Alpine. Brave stuff from Andre Negrao in the Signatech Alpine, in the blue 36 car. He was on the dirt, filth on the tires, he still managed to get down the inside and he drives for the race lead. Roman Rusinov in the orange and black machine now in second place. Winning a 24 hour race is more than just winning a sprint race or a 200 mile race. Every situation that you've had during a season. Every situation on the track, every situation with the car. Every situation with tires, engines, people, competitors, weather, track conditions. Every situation that you have during a championship run of a season, you have in 24 hours at Le Mans. You cannot afford to make the wrong decision and strategy. So that's why you have to kind of work at how am I going to get to the hour 24 mark, with least amount of errors. These races are all about reducing potential for error. And for me the guy that wins is usually the guy who's made the least number of mistakes. If you prepare well enough, then you can cover most eventualities. If you don't prepare, then you prepare to fail. NARRATOR: Car is ready, but it won't start. Back into the garage. This could cost them victory. Lead up the blue car, Signatech Alpine at Nico La Pierre. Jose Maria Lopez is on pit road. He has only just stopped, he's come in after just one lap. What's going on? They've changed the right front tire. Topped up with fuel away he goes. Just that one tire. JOSE: It should be the reading is coming from the sensor. TEAMMATE: Are you sure? (RADIO BREAKING UP) OK, come back slowly, come back slowly. NARRATOR: Look in his steering, it still says puncture. Have they change the wrong tire? Confusion reigns at Toyota. They don't know what's going on with the number seven car. Is it a sensor issue? There is the number seven, creeping back to pit. Number eight takes the lead in the final hour of the race. Unbelievable scenes. It's a whole team effort, these 24 hour races. The drivers can't do it on their own. We can't do it without the drivers. But we have to give the drivers the tools where he can perform, at the level that he needs to perform at. If we don't give them the tool, they can't do the job. No matter if you're the greatest driver in the world. If the tires are flat, you're not going to go very fast. NARRATOR: It sounds as though the number seven will now not win Le Mans 2019. This race is so difficult and so hard for the drivers, for the crew members, for the engineers, for the strategists, for the managers. It's so hard and so difficult, and that's why it's so emotional to win this race. It's a sport where one guy makes a difference, but there is a massive team behind him, and it's a real, real group sport, team sport. So for me, I think the whole thing makes it special. But I guess the number one is just because I love to drive the cars on its limits. That's what gives me the massive pleasure to be a racing driver. Motor sports is just another arena to show or find your limits. For me, finding the ultimate lap, the perfect setup or the perfect race is one way of seeking perfection. NARRATOR: 15 minutes from the end. Maybe the number 51 Ferrari will do what Ferrari did 70 years ago. When they claimed their first outright win at Le Mans. It has been a really, really hard and long journey to become a professional driver. This year, being able to complete again, those name was something that I was really proud of, 'cause I was seeing them on TV, on the magazine. And I was always dreaming that one day I will be with them. On the past years, I could see that everything was done by him to do the things properly. It's my biggest passion. I was going to sleep thinking about it, waking up thinking about it. So when I was in the ligne droite des Hunaudieres for the first time, just behind the Ford of Scott Dixon. I was like okay, I made the first step, which is to do the first time at the Le Mans. Let's see if I can do the second step later. Jules, has a good head. It's his first year here, but I think he realizes just how important the races is for him, for his career. We are a team and that's where I like to see that. I could stay in that car to sleep on it. I mean, I was, that was the best day of my life. Achieving a win in Le Mans would mean anything. You know I sometimes joke that if I win Le Mans I will retire, but I don't think so. You know you've got the best in the world all competing you know on that one day to try and win that race. And a lot of the times it's almost impossible. In motor sports you need to be good, but you also need to be lucky. And sometime Le Mans gets to choose. (EPIC MUSIC) Interestingly, racing is a sport that, that rewards tenure.

Because when I was a kid, before I wanted to be a race car driver, I wanted to be an astronaut because I was obsessed with space and I said I wanted to go to the moon so. So, I think I would do, I would be there in a spaceship. Maybe. I'm obviously a bit of a geek nerd type guy. So I like computers, I like the technology, I like this type of things. But actually knowing exactly what I'll do. It's pretty tricky. (SOFT PIANO MUSIC) You know technology is something that I really love these days. But yeah I dunno. I'm just very happy that this worked out. (SOFT PIANO MUSIC) (SPEAKING FRENCH) Jules always pretended he wanted to be an aircraft pilot So believed him, And he fooled us.
