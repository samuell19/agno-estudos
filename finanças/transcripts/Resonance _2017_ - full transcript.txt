But it's been what, four years since you had a proper vacation? That's not true, I've had a couple of days off. Listen to yourself. Is it gonna be like this forever? No, of course not. I mean, what if, we wanna get married or have kids someday? I, I thought you didn't wanna have kids. Nevermind. How about we skip desert and, I know, we retire instead? No. Are you sure? - Hmm? - Stop. Look. Listen. I love you and that's all that matters. Okay? Tell me you love me. Tell me you love me. - Tell me. - I love you. You know I do. Get up. What? Stand up. Oh gosh, you're not gonna do that thing again are you? What thing? My moves? Come on, right now, you and me. Don't act like you don't love my killer moves come on. Are you serious? - Let's go. - Really? Yes, we're gonna dance, come on. Oh god, okay. Then, I don't know show me those killer moves that you've got huh? Hey babes, what do you want to have for breakfast? We have some eggs, croissants, some groot and we have some leftovers from last night? Babes? I'll have whatever you're having. Hey, did we leave the door open last night? No, I don't know, I mean, I had one too many last night so... Nevermind. - I'm starving. - Yeah so am I. I can't wait to head out later. Same. And I promise no work today, okay? - Promise? - Hmm-mm. Okay. Max, where are you? Hey slowpoke. Are you ready? - Yeah. - Yeah. Are you ready? Yes I am. Alright. Then let's go. Cool. Hey, are there any wild animals we should be afraid of? Nah, don't worry about that. You know what would be awesome? What? If we could take a picture of a mother bear and her cubs. What about the father? Yeah, he can be in it too. What, you mean like a family portrait? Yeah, like a family portrait. Alright, but if daddy bear shows up, I'm taking a run for it. Just so you know. He's gonna come after you anyway. - Me? - Yeah totally. Max, how do you isolate a single subject again? What, you want more shallow depth of field? - Uh huh. - Adjust the aperture. The aperture. Uh, there are too many buttons, I've forgot which one it was. Sorry. It's that one, and you just turn that one. - This one? - Yeah, until it's right. You know I miss this, you know. Hmm-mm. Maybe we can go to like, I don't France or Italy next time? Maybe next year or something? Hmm, definitely. Cool. Alright. Elena, come take a look. Elena? Elena? Elena! Elena! There you are, come on, I wanna show you some... Shh. Can't you hear it? It's getting louder. What is it? - It's... - I don't know it's... Oh God, you're, you're bleeding out of your nose. Wait, no, no, I've got tissues. Here. And just keep it here. You're bleeding too, you're bleeding. What the fuck? Max, I, I, I think we should go. Max, let's go, come on. What just happened? I don't know. What was that sound? It sounded industrial. It can't be. Hang on, what if there's something in the woods? Like what? I don't know like a factory, or a secret military base. What? Why would there be a factory or a secret military base in these woods? - I don't know. - Come on. It's just a theory. Well your theory's wrong and it's awful. Well at least I'm trying to figure out what it was, I mean don't you wanna know? No, I don't wanna know. Can we just keep walking? I mean, what if they're like experimenting on people, on animals or, I don't know what else is in woods? You're really giving a green light to that crazy theory of yours huh? Look, like, there's nothing out there. It's all woods. There's no fucking factory. I just wanna know what the hell happened back there. Listen, nothing happened, can we just go? Nothing happened? Max, we were in the middle of the woods and you get a nose bleed, I get a nose bleed. Which, by the way, we've both never had before. You're telling me that that did not happen at all huh? Listen, there's no crazy military base in these woods. Well how do you know? 'Cause I checked. I've been here before and there's nothing out there but nature. Well you know, that doesn't mean that there can't be anything out here. There is a little town. A 13 mile hike straight through the forest. I've been there before and they're certainly not conducting any crazy experiments over there. There's no factory or military base, or anything else for that matter. It's all woods. Then what the hell, what the hell was that sound? Nothing, it was like, it was probably like an electromagnetic disturbance in the atmosphere. Seriously that shit happens all the time, caused by a solar flare. I read about that online. Electromagnetic disturbance. - Yeah. - Solar flare huh? Yeah caused by a... So what? - You making fun of me now? - Next we time, yeah. So next time we go in the woods I'm supposed to bring some sun block for the nose bleed. Because you know what, I completely forgot to buy some for this trip. Yeah. Come on. What did you want me to see anyway? Nevermind, I'll show you later. What's wrong? Shit my work. You okay? Yeah, it's fine. Max, we need to do something. What do you mean? Well, somebody was in this house. We don't know that. No, but the door was open. I was, I was thinking, it was probably me again, I think I just left the door open again. It wouldn't be the first time. Max, I saw you close the door. I could have lost my job because of this. I mean, what if he was in here last night? I mean, what if he's still out there? Calm down okay. Don't exaggerate. I'm not exaggerating. Look, you know what, you ought to take me seriously okay Max. Hey, I set it all up, it's done. If anyone's gonna try and get in here tonight. They better bring their smile 'cause the camera gonna flash right in their face and the alarms gonna go off as well. It's like we have this super expensive, high tech, whatever system, like, without any of the flaws really. So you don't really have to worry about anything. We're totally safe right now. Elena. Hi. - Hi. - How's work? It's making progress. Did you lock everythinG? - Yeah everything's locked. - Good. No worries. Besides, any fucker tries to get in here, he gets a taste of our click move, remember? What was that? What? What? Oh Max. Oh my God, I was right. Somebody was in here. Stay here, stay inside. Hey, you think this is funny? Breaking in here! Come over and show yourself right now! You think this is funny huh? You okay? Yeah I think so. We need to call the cops. It was probably just a teenager trying to scare us alright. They're gone now. Teenagers? Max, I thought you said there was nobody here. What if they're still out there huh? What if they're trying to hurt us Max? No, I wanna call the cops. Listen, we're in the middle of the woods. So? Max, I wanna call the cops now. Listen okay, it's 4:00 a.m., we're gonna call the cops first thing in the morning. I promise, alright. You go get some sleep, go get some rest. I'm gonna stay up for a while. Okay, it's gonna be fine. Tomorrow morning we're gonna call the cops. Hey, come here. Elena? Yeah. - You're up. - Hmm-mm. Did you get a good nights sleep? No, not really. We should call the cops. Right now? Yeah, why wait? Well, I don't think that's a good idea. Why not? Well, nothing's missing. Like, everything's still here, nothing's stolen. Somebody was in this house last night. Nothing was stolen. Yeah I know that, but somebody was in this house last night and we have a photo, so why can't we call the cops. Look, these were all made last night. And none of 'em show anything weird. Look at that. The doors open in all of 'em. How, how's that possible? I don't know. Like, it looks like the door was already open before the pictures were taken. That can't be, I saw you close the door last night. We must have opened the door from the inside, before the alarm was triggered. One of us? Hmm, I have a theory. Maybe one of us opened the door whilst sleepwalking. Sleepwalking? I didn't say it was a good theory. Max, if one of us was sleepwalking that means that one of us should have been in the photos and we're not in the photos. I could walked up to the computer, paused the software and then opened the door. Hmm-mm, so please explain to me then how is it possible that you were in bed with me when the flashes were triggered? Then it must have been a glitch. A glitch? Look I, I wanna call the cops. - You wanna call the cops? - Hmm-mm. You wanna call the cops and tell 'em what? We have, what, am imaginary burglar? Really? You wanna call the cops, make 'em drive all the way up here and then ruin the whole weekend. Well just do it. There's my phone, go ahead, call the cops. You're a fucking loony. That's what I thought. Bullshit. How's work? Fine. Listen, I wanted to head out into the woods later. Like, maybe, you wanna join me? I got a lot of work to do, so. Is that all? Maz. Come on Max, pick up. Come on. Jesus. Come on. Elena. Oh my god, are you alright? Yeah, I'm fine. No you're not fine, you're bleeding again. What's going on? Why are we packed? We need to leave. What do you mean leave? We still have a couple of days here. - What do you mean? - We need to leave, it's dangerous. You're still upset about last night right? Why aren't you listening to me? This is about your work again isn't it? - No, it's... - This was supposed to be a romantic trip together and all you've done is either work or complain. Nothing's ever good enough for you. I want to leave. Then leave. I'm not going anywhere. Do you want anything to eat? Don't you just love classical music? It's absolutely soothing to the mind. Wallace, you don't like classical music? Well no, actually I think it's quite boring. Boring? Do you even know who this is? This is Alexander Glazunov, he's one of the most excellent and distinguished musicians of all time. Everything but boring. Sorry I just don't like classical music. Jesus Christ. Here, put some pressure here. You sure you don't want anything to eat? No, I'm not hungry. Well, you need to eat something. I said I'm not hungry Max. I thought it and we'll go first thing in the morning. Fine. The things people come up with these days. Max. Max! What happened? You're bleeding, we need to get you to the hospital, right now. Max. Okay, come here. Alright. It's okay, come on. Let's go right now. Ready, come on. Okay, come on. Okay. Just to the car. It's okay. Max. Max. I'm getting us out of here, you're bleeding. Come on, come on, come on, come on. Max. Come on, I don't know. - Max. - Goddammit, come on. Shh, shh. What happened? I don't know. What do you mean? What happened? What do you mean you don't know? It was, there was something in the bedroom Max. And you in my dream and then I woke up and... We're gonna, we're gonna get you to the hospital. We need... I'm sorry. I didn't mean to ruin our weekend together. Shh, don't be sorry, don't be sorry. Ow Max. Come on, just start.
