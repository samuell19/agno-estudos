No radiation? Perez, what did you got? Chronometer is up and running, sir. We'll have an answer as soon as we have triangulation. Perfect. Gives you fifteen to scout the perimeter. There's gotta be somebody alive out there. Yes, sir. Hey you two. Keep your profession. Yes, sir. What exactly are we looking for? There's nothing out here. What do you think you're doing? We're not due back for another fifteen minutes. Besides, what he doesn't know won't hurt him. Not now, Marco. I don't wanna be put on report. Oh! Help! Help me! Help! This is Perez. Captain Finis, what's your status? This is Perez. I repeat, Captain Finis, what's your status? Let's go! What the hell did this? Find the latch. Got it! Let's go! Come on! Go... - Dial us in. - I'm on it. Hurry. Come on. Okay. Almost there. Got it! Move aside, move. What happened, private? Hey, you're gonna be fine. What went wrong out there? It's not here, captain. What about the latch? Where is it? No. I need to know where the device is. Do you have it with you? With Marco. Marco? Marco. Damn it. Captain? It's on the other side. It was then that he realized his mistake. Building the device was supposed... to provide answers. Would humanity achieve... a utopian society or would... be destroy ourselves? The answer was swift in coming. The device brought only suffering... death and despair. What he beheld was no glorious... future, it was the end of man... the end of hope, of love. The end of the world. Yes, question? Dude, are you kidding me with this? I'm sorry. Don't quite understand the question. You wrote the book in this weird... technical jargon and it's... it's just not a story. It's like a scientific manual for... events that actually happened. Still waiting for a question. So like, what's it all about? Well, it's in a narrative style that I felt would be engaging for... the reader and you know, it made it a lot more readable. I get that, it's just... half the footnotes you're alluding to don't exist. They're just marked classified. So, is your narrative style... to try and piss off your readers? I think that's a good question but... I wonder that I really can't provide an intelligent answer... for in the limited time that I have. So... What? Yeah, look. I'm sorry. I'm honored to be here and... really appreciate you guys coming out. but I have a previous engagement so gotta run. And you know, enjoy the book. Please buy many copies... for friends and family. Cheers. James. Angela. Bit of a step up from the ol' Chevy, isn't? it? Just get in. Am I getting offed? You've been ignoring my calls. Well, there was the divorce, and the book tour... tour being a little presumptuous of course. I read it. Oh, your end notes saying they were classified... that was a nice touch. Course if it had been five years ago... it may not have been seen in the same light. Five years ago. We're finished here. James. I was out of line. It's important! I thought we'd finished with this clandestine crap. There's been an accident, and it involves your work. What, somebody accidentally bought a copy of the book? Your previous work. - Time travel? - Yes. You're serious. Yes. - That's from the device. - A refraction crystal. Something to remember you by. It's unlike you to cling to failure. It didn't fail. The project? It works. We have a plane leaving in twenty minutes. Attention, all nonessential personnel... check in with the duty officer by 0700. Dr. Watkins, need you to report to the E.M. chamber. The team were supposed to go to the other side... and set up a stellar chronometer. - To determine what year it was. - Exactly... but they were interrupted before they could get a reading. By what? The future isn't what we thought it was going to be. Look James, before we get into this I need to apologize. What part, exactly? For not talking you into staying. Staying? People died because of me, because of my arrogance. We succeeded. Tell it to the ten people who disappeared. Look, I would give anything to change what happened. But, that's why we're doing this. You of all people know the potential here. We can go back and fix it. This whole place should've been leveled. It's not all on your shoulders. Hundreds of people were right beside you. And I pushed the button. And I stayed behind to clean up the mess. You should've left with me. What was I supposed to do? These people buried my career. And you chose them over me. Stop. Arms up. Well, it's about time. Colonel Wichita, for the welcome wagon. My apologies. I wanted to witness the return of the prodigal son. So, how's it been? Oh, you know, women, booze, parties, writing. Ah yes, your book. Touched on some sensitive subjects. Classified subjects. He read it, too. Enough that I was going to have you arrested for writing it. Until I was convinced otherwise. - Hmm? By whom? - Your wife. Ex-wife. She seems to think I've done enough to ruin your life already. Thanks. Well, we're all tickled pink that you landed on your feet... more or less. Dr. Radnor is to have complete access to this facility. Welcome back, James. You said you were gonna shut it down. No. I told you that we would not try to recreate your experiment. And yet, here you are doing exactly that anyway. Listen Radnor, this country is falling behind. Mining the future for technology can put us back on top. The project's working so well, what do you need me for? Fair enough. Show him. What the hell happened here? We had a little trouble with the natives. - Natives? What, you mean the... - From the future. Yes. I thought you said he was a genius. James, meet Dr. Felix Watkins. - He's the one who is... - What did you do? I realized that the data from your initial experiment... was consistent with a temporal rip but it was unstable. You were able to rework the sequence? - Yes. - How? Doctor, it's rather complicated. Yes, I know it is. I came up with it. Look, what did you change? I formulated a new temporal coefficient. - It was quite simple, really... - Once you had... my original sequences and equations to work off of, yes. I perfected them. No, you filled in the blanks. A new temporal coefficient... doesn't solve the overriding problem. We have been successful, successful... You have not been lucky. Look, is that why I'm here. Because he doesn't understand the underlying concept? No, James, look, Felix was the one who was able to... maintain the first stable rip. Now, we need you because... well, we ran into a problem with the latch. That's what we call the device that latches onto... 'Cause it latches on to reiterative tachyon fluctuations. Yes, I know, I invented it. Look, I can't believe you built another one. This is nuts! Look, where is the thing now? It's not a question of where, it's more a question of when. Detecting tachyon surge. E.M. radiation rising. This sometimes happens before a rip. Sometimes? Yeah, you might wanna stand back. James. Tachyon surge reaches 38,000 cycles per millisecond... the space-time continuum will rip. Who's tracking this? It's amazing. No, James. James, look out! Yeah, we might wanna get out of here. What the hell were those things? Well technically they're known as U.B.E.s... unknown biological entities. We just call them hostiles. Yeah but, surely the humans from the future would wanna... destroy creatures that hunt, kill and eat us. Well, as far as we can tell, in the future humanity is... Extinct. Vanished from the face of the earth. So you traveled thousands of years into the future... only to discover the end of mankind? Look, James, if humanity's gonna be destroyed... then don't you wanna find out how, when? Maybe try and figure out a way to stop it? Yeah but, you've lost control of the rip. You don't even know where the latch is. We believe it's been damaged and is now malfunctioning. Creating rips at random intervals, each time the rips do appear... they're growing larger and they're lasting longer. It's almost as though they're feeding off themselves. You've got a problem that's getting exponentially worse. - Yes. - And you're screwed. Soon the rips will become permanent. By that point they'll be large enough to swallow the whole base... then the whole state. Eventually they'll engulf the entire planet in a permanent rip... between present and future. So what do you want me to do about it? Fix the device. How? It's on the other side, remember with your hostiles? Can you build another one? Of course I can, given enough time, but that's not gonna help us. Look, each device is keyed to a specific time. Your latch jumped, say, a thousand years into the future. That's what ensures you come back to the time that you left from. And if I built another one, it there's no way of controlling... when it would send us. I mean, it could send us back in time. Then we proceed with Plan B. Captain Hoyle will assemble a team to retrieve the device. No, you can't just bring it back. He's right. If we bring the latch back through an open rip... - it... - Kaboom! And you're the only person who can repair it, correct? Look, why don't you talk to him? He's the guy who built the device. Based on your plans and designs, Doctor. Which means you're the only one who can repair it. Okay. Let me see if I got this straight. You want me to travel through a rip in time... find and repair a device that you lost and broke... all the while trying to avoid rampaging creatures from the future. That about sum it up? - James, wait! - Don't bother following me. Hold it right there, sir. Oh, come on. He's free to leave. It sure doesn't look that way. I can't force you to help, James. But that's not gonna stop you from trying. I don't think we understand each other. No, have to agree with you on that. You think I'm reckless... that I pushed this project without thinking of consequences. My job is to consider consequences. Is gaining X worth losing Y? So this project was worth the lives of those soldiers? People have died. But without your help, more people will. Felix didn't spend his career designing this technology, you did. But, forget it. Go. Get him a ride. I know what's wrong with the latch. I think I can fix it. The latch if your first priority. Until you find it, the earth is in your hands. And I shouldn't need to remind you, if it's damaged further... you could be stranded. Rip should spit you out a few hundred yards from the spike. And this E.M scanner should point you in the right direction. That's a lot of shoulds. - Tyrell. - Yes sir. I want you and Pip on point with the Doc. - Keep it tight. - Roger that. Hey, what happens if the Doc can't fix this thing? Okay, be fine, it's just like... stepping through a revolving door, right? He's smarter than he looks. Sir, what are the rules of engagement? Yeah. We're gonna shoot these bastards, right? We're going into enemy territory. We'll keep a low profile, unless we see an enemy target. Roger that. It's like stepping through a revolving door, right. Alright squad, we're Oscar Mike. Stay sharp. Temporal rip is imminent. Move into positions. When you're through, stay clear of the rip. Yes sir. Pip, lead the way. Damm it, Doc. I'm sorry. Pull yourself together. Alright, that's our cue. Fan out, groups of two. You get any E.M. readings... see any hostile activity, you radio in. - Is that clear? - Sir, yes sir! - Tyrell, Pip, you're with the Doc. - Sir, yes sir! Now, people, wake up and move out! Man, you guys sure did screw this thing up. Yeah, we sure did. Thanks. God... that time jump is not doing great things to my inner ear. Name's Peter Squally. But everybody calls me Pip-Squeak. James Radnor. - What? - Come on, man... everybody knows who you are. You're the reason we all out here gettin' hunted by monsters. Right. I'm sorry about that. Hey, don't be sorry, man. Alright, now, speaking of... what is the strategy if we run into one? Don't worry, Doc, we take care of ya. But, if you see me running... I suggest you do the same. Noted. Hey, Doc! Where you goin'? Supposed to stay behind me! This is it. We found it. That wasn't so bad now, was it? God. It's gotta be... - Doc. - Yeah, you mind giving me a hand? Yeah. Speakin' of hands, if you wanna keep yours... you might consider takin' a big ol' step back. Why? What is it? What is it? What? Let's go! Go! Let's go! This is Tyrell! We got enemy. Repeat, enemy! Birds! Pip-Squeak, go! Clear! Tyrell! Hardcore. Damn it, corporal! What's going on? I heard live fire. We found the latch, sir. - Where is it? - Oh, these evil raptor birds... Where's the latch! Son of a bitch! Fall back, team! Fall back! Get those legs working! Move! Heads down! This way! Damn it! We hold in there! Suppression team in there! Sight for the corner! Short bursts! Short bursts! Aim for the body! You're cleared hot! Tyrell, one o'clock, hot! I got ya! Pip-Squeak, watch the roof! Sir, yes sir! Stay controlled! Hold your fire! Are we still cleared hot, sir? No. Hold your fire. Is that? Those creatures. Hold your positions. There's something else out there. Hold your fire. No... Patterson. We have been waiting a long time for you. You know these men? Sorta. I killed them. No radio contact during the rip. Large pupils, light sensitive skin... endogenous circadian rhythms and nerve ganglia. We can assume a primarily nocturnal existence. Assume? I'm still working. We won't know anything for sure until... - Yeah. Where's the DNA test? - It isn't finished. That should be your first priority. It's running on the sequencer right now. I can't make it process any faster. Look, you should've let me go with them. Negative, Doctor. Too dangerous for a civilian. I don't feel right about this. The United States government does not... make decisions based on feelings. Yeah, well maybe they should. Look, people's lives are at stake. I shouldn't be in here dissecting this thing. I should be out there helping. Get your initial findings into this report as soon as possible. I need to send... Well... let's just say, people are waiting to hear what you find. Oncology. This is Colonel Wichita. How is he, Doctor? I don't accept that. Are there experimental options, anything at all? Please change your rhetoric, Doctor. I... There is always cause for hope. You mind explaining this to me? Patterson's team were the guinea pigs man... the first team we tried to send through time. Yeah, but I thought you killed them. Yeah, you and me both, but I guess we must've just... what, zapped you forward? We were only meant to go fifteen minutes into the future... but somehow that didn't quite pan out. Sure did take you long enough to come looking for us. - Yeah, look, about... - Yeah, that's a pleasure. Look, it's not that we're not grateful. It's just... how do we get back anyway? That part is a little complicated. Complicated? No, complicated is living off dead squirrels... and dirty river water for God knows how long. We'll get you home as soon as we can. But to do it, we need to find the latch. The latch? It's our one ticket home. No latch, no time travel. Right now it's in the middle of a frickin' giant ostrich nest. Yeah, we need to go get it. No, we need to get underground. Excuse me? They hunt at night. Great. Hey, what was that thing you used back there, scared off the creatures? You mean this guy? Is that bone? Vocal chords from a morlock. Excuse me? Did you say morlock? Yeah. We found some newspapers and that's what people called them. Before they got wiped out. Anyway, you don't wanna do that. Why's that? They scare predators, but they attract morlocks. We need to talk. The creatures aren't creatures. Their genetic makeup is human. That isn't all. The DNA, the chromosome pairs are identical. - Meaning? - Well... all human life has forty-six chromosomes... two sets of twenty-three, one from each parent. Whatever these things are, they came from one human... a male, to be specific. We need to tell somebody about this. Listen, we need to get your data to Project E.L.O.I. as soon as possible. So they can begin extracting the DNA. No, well, there might still be a way to prevent it... so that no one else gets hurt. No one will, I promise. But first we need to get that data to the hospital. What's happening? It's a major E.M. spike. No radio contact yet but... but something is definitely coming in. Should be James. Felix. Open the door. Open the damn door! I'm trying. No. No! Oh my god. What is this place? Wait, stop. Where're you taking us? Don't you recognize it? Welcome home. Okay guys, go. Move. Come on, keep moving. Do you know what happened to all the people? I mean, is it's like this everywhere? We've only been as far as the nearest town. That was bad enough, crawling with morlocks. We didn't wanna go any further than that... because we didn't wanna miss the rescue party. Besides, this is the safest place to be. Roof over our head, doors that still lock... and a locker full of ammo. And you got power. Yeah. Backup generator was the only thing that survived... whatever blew this place. I don't think I would've made it if I was in your shoes. Yeah. You're probably right. We dragged most of our stuff down here. It's the most secure spot in the whole building. We had hoped to find enough odds and ends... to build a latch or whatever you call it. But most of the stuff was fried. There was one thing of note, though. Anderson, bring up the security footage. We need to talk. What is this? The video's corrupted. Just hang on. Creatures aren't creatures. They're genetic makeup is human. What the hell? We need to get your data to Project E.L.O.I. as soon as possible. So they can begin extracting the DNA. Well there might still be a way to prevent it... - so that no one else gets hurt. - They can't be human. No one will, I promise. Oh no. Look, can you pull up the Project E.L.O.I. file? What do you know about Project E.L.O.I.? Never heard of it. Look, is there anything else you can bring up? That's the end of the record. The server's scorched. So what're we gonna do? - About what? - About this? I mean, look those things are humans. We can't just kill them. They won't extend you the same courtesy. We gotta get 'em back to the way they were before or... stop this from happening in the first place. No we don't. We need to find the latch... and get the hell out of here. I'm sorry about your wife. No one else is gonna say this to you, so I will. If the morlocks got her, she's dead. Look, this isn't just about Angela. Look, I have an obligation. What about your obligations to us? We've waited years... for you to come and find us and when you do you spend your time... running around morlock country looking for a dead girl... and looking for clues for something that hasn't even happened yet. You aren't even looking for us. I have a family. They think I'm dead. My kids think I'm dead. If you do anything but find the latch and get us the hell out of here... you're risking our lives. - I'm sorry, but I have to insist... - No. Patterson's right. What? I have orders. Get the latch, bring it home. C.O. said if I find any of our missing people, I bring 'em back. But he was clear. The latch is our mission. Yeah, but I created this. I mean... this could be the one good thing that comes of it. I mean, if we have to go to one of the nearest cities... look up some files, try to figure out what caused... My orders are final! At sunup, we go get this thing and get the hell out of here. And you got a problem with that, when we get back... you take it up with Wichita. Doc. See anything? Nope. All clear. Yeah. Must've been hard for you to try and work out a life here. I was eating army rations, either way. Me, I couldn't handle it. I mean the stress and everything. I don't know how you can live that long... with just those guys around here. Meaning? Come on, man. They're a sad-looking bunch. You ladies, man you know, have needs. Know what I'm sayin'? Well, that's good. Really, just great. I finally got somebody new to talk to, you're a walking cliche. Okay. Okay. Okay Anderson, we need a minute here. You take five. How many? Five. Half the team. I lost the first when we were making our way uptown... just up and vanished. I didn't know anything was wrong... till I found his dog tags in a pile of blood. They build nests, collect their kills... their captures, if you like. Any idea where they'd 've taken 'em? Yeah. But you don't wanna go there. Let's start over. Hi, I'm Tyrell. Okay, Tyrell. This is what I've been thinking about since... the day we got stuck here. Loading it. Pointing it. Pulling the trigger. Ending all my problems, forever. You were gonna kill yourself? Nah. I was gonna shoot Patterson. Son of a bitch. Get the door. Move! What's goin' on? Back! Come on! I thought you said this place was secure. - It was. - Well, not anymore. Time to move out. Move! Go! Cortez, head for the hatch! We're movin' out! Keep movin'! Watch your back! Go! Nice of you to join us. Clear! Go! Move! Get some speed! Keep movin'! Come in. Colonel, you wanted to see me? Dr. Watkins, you need to finish what Dr. Kelly started. The purpose of this project is bring back technology from the future. Instead we found these creatures. And after our last encounter, Dr. Kelly did a genetic test. They're human. They're like cousins. More primitive than us in some ways and in others more evolved... stronger, faster, more resistant to disease. If we could extract their DNA, we could use it to... Colonel, Dr. Kelly was killed by one of these creatures. We don't know that. I think we oughta be focused on getting our people back right now... besides, which I'm not a geneticist. I think we oughta wait and bring in someone who's an expert on DNA. It can't wait. And it's an order. I'm not military. I'm a civilian. And I'm telling you it's not going to happen. Start work on the DNA extraction or there will be repercussions. It was right here. Now I got nothing. You sure this is the right place? I'm positive. Morlocks were here. They must've taken the latch. - Why would they? - Because they collect junk. - Why? - Because they're American. I don't know. We seen 'em picking up old rubbish, broken toasters, VCRs. Well whatever their reasons for taking it... we need that device to get back home. Let's get moving. You recognize it? It's Angela's. They've taken her. Help me! We've trailed the morlocks this far before. But beyond it, ain't no one ever come back. At least we know they hunt at night. Exactly. Which means that during the day they hold up some place dark... where they've got the advantage. Like what, a cave? Think bigger. Looks like we'll have to split up. I'm gonna head west, find some high ground. Alright. Tyrell, take Pip and Cortez, head down. - Remember, keep your eyes open... - And my lips sealed. Right. Radio silence, got it. Come on, you heard the man. Move out. I guess I'm with you? Lucky me. Toppling oppressive regimes, assassinate brutal dictators. Hell, I'd even do another U.N. police action. But this, getting' lost in time? Wading through a sewer that smells like monkey crap... this definitely ain't what I signed on for. There's always Vera, right? Yeah. Nothin' loves good misery like good company... - What happened? - It's kind of dark. Vera? Fall back. - See anything, man? - Nuh-uh. What's that? You see that? Man, what the hell is that? What? Man. You're one impressive bitch. She used us for bait. You think that's impressive? Wait 'til you see what I found. This place is a damned labyrinth. We're not getting anywhere. Help me! What was that? I hear it, too. That was Angela. Hey, what the hell are you doing? The latch is our priority. You're gonna need this. Okay. Make it quick. Help me! Help me! Help me! Help! Help me! Help me! Help! James! - Angela! - James! - You gotta get me out of here. - Okay. You've got to be quiet. They're everywhere. Okay. I think I found a way out. Can you get up there? Can you get up? Wait, just stay there. Let's go. Go! What d'ya think? I'll get it working. It's amazing after all these years, they've still got power. Impressed? You know it, baby. Guys? I think we might have a slight problem. Captain. Damn it, Tyrell, does maintain radio silence mean anything to you? Yeah, I know sir. But it's where you are. - What do you mean, where I am? - They're everywhere. You're about to become really popular. They're everywhere. I'm gonna have to get back to you. - Come on, let's move. - Go. Go! Come on! Hey, come on! There're hundreds of these things! Take the latch and get your damn ass in there! Move! Dead end! Patterson. Patterson! No time for Google eyes. Get your asses moving! Tyrell, what's your E.T.A.? I can't roger you, sir. I can't hear. Come on! Hoyle! Get on the other side of the light! Get the doors shut. Tyrell! We have to get something! James! What's your E.T.A.? Where are you guys? Move back! The elevator's not working. It's out of power. - So we're... - Cover me. - Don't do it! - I got it. Come on! Come on! Come on! The tissue started to degrade as soon as the creature died. At this point there's nothing left to... What're you telling me? I can't do it. Not with what we have. If you want useable DNA, we have to have a live sample. Where's Patterson? Sorry, Cortez. I understand. What is that? Gonna need to fix that latch! It's more of a mess than I thought. Tyrell, let's get this thing moving! I'm on it. - Can you do it? - I don't know. Doc, talk to me. How we doing here? I'm working as fast as I can! That's not good enough! We need an exit now! The core bridge is damaged. So, what do you need? I don't know! We got it! Hope this doesn't blow us up. Another E.M. pulse. Yup, something's coming in. - Can you identify it? - No, but it's something big. Lower your weapons. Captain, you made it. Sir. And the others? Lost 'em, sir. But we did manage to pick up some strays. The latch, where is it? It's right here. And let me tell ya, after a very large scotch... possibly a nice hot bath... I'm going to really enjoy bashing it to pieces with a hammer. Private Anderson, please relieve Dr. Radnor of his cargo. It's imperative that this program go on... with or without you. You son of a bitch. Glad you're home safe, Doctor. Colonel! Sir, I think you should see this. Hey. Hey Doc. How long does she gotta be in there? 'Til she's been examined, debriefed. She's got a family and friends. I assume she does. I mean, they're gonna wanna know that she's okay. A few more weeks ain't gonna make any difference. Weeks? Look, I'll do whatever I can to get her out sooner. Yeah. Right. What about Dr. Radnor? You're all gonna stand by and just let that happen? My hands are tied. You two had a thing, right? You don't have children. Come in, make yourself at home. I have a son. I would do anything for him, whatever it took to make him safe. Yeah, you know what? Save the spiel. I've heard it all before. You know, the North Koreans are gonna nuke us... Chinese are owning our mortgages, Iranian jihads, all of it. Time travel isn't a weapon. This isn't about weapons. It's about a twenty year old boy lying in a hospital... hooked up to a ventilator, dying... while doctors tell me there's nothing they can do. Now these morlocks are genetically related to humans... but they're stronger, more resistant to disease. Project E.L.O.I. was designed to bring back technology... from the future to save this country. And that is exactly what it's gonna do. Starting with my son. No. No... I've seen the future. I know what happens. If you use morlock DNA to save your son, if you play God... it's just gonna guarantee that what I witnessed comes true. Colonel. Colonel, don't do this! Colonel! Colonel, I was wondering if I could... I don't change my mind, Doctor, so don't ask. I understand. Let me talk to him. Maybe I can convince him. You have five minutes. Private. Look, I don't have much time. I'm no good at this, but you were right. We should've never continued with the experiment. You know, the whole time we're together I was usually wrong... so I guess I owe you. What can we do to make it right? Look, Wichita is off the reservation. He's got his own agenda. We can't get to the latch to shut it down. Well, we can't just give up. I'm gonna get you out of here. No, Angela. You're our only hope. You've to get out there... you've to tell people what's going on, try to stop it. Well, what about you? Don't worry about me, you just... you go. Okay, here goes nothin'. Dr Felix Watkins, first attempt... data retrieval on the reclaimed latch. Initializing... and... good. Data's flowing nicely. Wait. This is impossible. Angela, how far in the future did you think you traveled? Well, I assumed thousands... Sixty-eight years. That's what the latch is telling us. You traveled sixty-eight years into the future. That means that whatever's gonna happen... Is gonna happen very soon. Oh my God. How? But how? What? What're you doing? It's going to be me. Me. You understand? Not you and not your friend Radnor. - Felix... - Stand back. We've had enough messing around with this thing... Felix... And the colonel, he's insane. He threatened me. - Did you know that? - Felix. We are gonna stay and do science here. - Felix... - We're gonna go step-by-step... and stop the wildcat show grade stuff. Do you under... Felix! Code red. All personnel to the hostiles have entered the reservation. - Repeat, hostiles have entered... - Oh, damn it. Oh my God. A rip just formed in the hangar, sir. Cause unknown. Seal the base. Nobody gets in or out. Yes sir. Son of a bitch. The base is under attack, they need your help. Go! What's going on? The morlock escaped and the time rip has opened. See, I told you I'd come back for you. - God I miss that. - Yeah. Not available? I'm being overwhelmed by hostiles. I mean we've seen hundreds of hostiles. I repeat, I'm being overrun by hostiles. I'm out of ammo. No! - Tyrell. - We've gotta get out of here. Okay. Gun. We gotta move and we gotta move fast. Let's do this. This way. Sir, I have a Private Strickland on the red line. Put him on. - Situation report, private. - Sir. We're getting slaughtered down here. We need reinforcements. I'm afraid that's not possible. I'm sealing off the base. - Retreat to... - Sir, we can't hold out. There's just too many of 'em. - There are hostiles everywhere. - Cut it off. All around my position. Sir, we are being overrun. I said cut the damned thing off, now. Sir. We are being overrun. Sir. They're afraid of the sunlight. As soon as the sun sets... we won't be able to stop 'em from leaving the base. If we destroy the latch... Not an option. Sir, we can't risk civilian contamination. We must follow containment protocol. I'm overriding that protocol. Sir, you're not authorized to override con... - These stairs lead outside, right? - Yeah. Alright, you go. I'll meet you up there. - No, I'm coming with you. - Angela, I... No, I won't let you leave me, not this time. I can't leave without making sure the latch is destroyed. I know where it is. Follow me. Ready for this? Believe it, baby. Tyrell! This is Wichita. I'm sending it now. Did you get it? Did you get the data? Damn it! Tyrell, are you okay? Talk to me. Are they all dead? Yeah, the grenade got 'em. - How bad am I? - You're good. Just need to find something to stop the bleeding. No. You go on without me. I'm not letting you get killed on account of me. Not gonna happen. - Vera... - No, not this time. Those creatures have killed too many people I care about. - What? - I knew you'd come around. I guess I'm just too darned good looking to resist, huh? - Yeah? - Yeah. Oh, come on crybaby, get your sorry ass out of here. Do you think it's safe? The morlocks must've got through by now. Will it work? Christ, not a chance. - What, and you can't... - Not this time, no. I mean... we've just run out of luck. Now what do we do, Doc? Come on, a man like you can't figure out a plan? The rate the rip is expanding, I mean... it's gonna overwhelm us in a matter of minutes. We need some kind of an energy pulse, like a... This? You can't just blow the... Heads down. You just stabilized the rip. Look, can you do the same thing again... only like a hundred times more powerful? Hey, this is the U.S. Armed Forces, Doc. We can do explosions. What are you doing? You don't open the door to hell without having a way to close it. What, this is self-destruct? That's right. This should be a big enough explosion. Fuck. Step away from the console, Captain. Listen to me. We have to follow protocol and contain this. If those things get out... Don't move. Colonel, listen. It's over. The latch is destroyed. Then you might as well have killed him yourself. Who? My son. Don't. - Where are the charges? - There. Doc, take this. Alright. What are you doing? Destroyed the console, but not the explosives. If we can get a charge inside the event horizon of the rip... When you say inside, you mean... No, we'll find another way. We don't have a lot of options, Angela. Look, if that rip continues to expand... it's the end of everything. Look, someone has to go. I started this... I'm responsible for this, I need to end this. Hand over the charges. What're you gonna do? This is a gut shot. I got twenty minutes, tops. Just hand over the damn charges, Doc! We both know I'm dead either way. I do this, at least... at least I know my death meant something. Thank you. You're running out of time. - Go. - Let's go. We need to get further away. We can't be this close when the rip blows. - Then what do we do? - I don't know. Over here! Come on! Come on, let's go! Come on, let's go! No! Into the tank. Get into the tank! Come on. Right here! Yes. Come on, let's go, baby. I got ya. Come on, take her up! Turn it around and head for the tank! Now what? Now we get this thing started. How hard can it be to turn it on? Oh, jeez. - We're out of control. - We're going to hit the dirt! - We're going down. - Hold on! It's them. They made it. Come with me. Come on, let's go! Okay. It's my turn. Yeah, well be my guest. Doc. It's all yours. Alright Mr Morlock, you are history. Come on, let's get the hell out of here. I think we're gonna make it. It's finally over, isn't it? I really hope so. Now you can write a book that isn't science fiction. Hi Danny. How are we tonight? Well, we'll try to make tonight a little bit better. This will hurt just a little. Good. Doing better already.
