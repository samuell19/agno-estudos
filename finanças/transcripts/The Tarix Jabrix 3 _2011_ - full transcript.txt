Sir! - Caca Sutarya. - Yes, sir? You're my only hope. - Okay. - Sit down. Yes, Sir. - Do you see what are these? - No. These are insurance claims from Bandung. And our company shall pay the loss,... ... damage, and robbery that caused... ... by biker gangs. Imagine if they happened continuously like this,... ... how much is our loss. And our company... ... will go bankrupt. Bankrupt. Bankrupt! Bankrupt! Bankrupt. So what do you want for me, Sir? You're a biker gang member, right? Yes, Sir. So you are the best man... ... to negotiate with them. Direct them to positive things. Don't let them cause a stir. It's okay if they make oncom. But don't let them cause a stir. Okay? So, you mean, I'll go to Bandung, Sir? Of course no. Go to Jogja. Of course you'll go to Bandung. All your expenses will be taken care... ... by... - Not me, Sir. - Me. - What? Bandung? - What? Bandung? That's right! Petrol allowance. Meal allowance. Snack allowance. Don't worry. Somebody's responsible for them. So, who come with me? So, how about our jobs, Cing? Mul. I know, Mul. Our jobs are important. But Bandung needs us, Mul. As Bandung citizen, we cannot stay still. I won't let Road Devil wreak havoc in Bandung! We should act, Mul! Sure, Cing! I am reluctant with my job at my Dad's office, too. That. I like your passion. Cik, Cok. How about you? We're ready! How? I depend on Coki's decision. Same! I depend on Ciko's decision too. Seriously! Do you come with me? - Of course! - Of course! That. How about you, Dang? Have a safe journey. Bring enough supplies. Fill up your tank. Prepare your bikes. So many speed bumps on the road to Bandung. - Dadang! - Dadang! I know. Let me fix your bikes first. Do you come with us? Am I invited? Of course! Cacing! Let's go. All right. As usual. Let's check our vehicles. - Understood. - Wheels! Check. Brakes? All good. Turn signals? Cing, we have no turn signals. After all, this is old bike. Be calm, Cing. I'm here. I can do this. All right. All good then. Rearview mirrors? Check. Okay. Sunglasses. - Check. - Here. And the most important one. Helmet. Remember this. Tarix Jabrix is a biker gang that is... Well mannered. - Obey the rules of... - Traffic. And... Respect the elders. Good. Bandung, we're coming. Tarix! - Jabrix! - Jabrix! Wait a minute! Wait. Someone's calling. Who's this? Annoying. It's Adi. It's Adi. Yes? Hello, Sir? Caca Sutarya. I'm sure you're ready to hit the road, right? Sure, Sir. We're all ready and everything will be... ... taken care by Cacing. I mean, Caca Sutarya will take care of them. If so, please use the company's car. Where's the car? The car will arrive within any minutes to your home. How about that, Caca? That car, Sir? Oh, no, Sir. - What? - Cing? Cing? Cing? Who is it? Ugly car. "Join The Insurance." Dang! - What's wrong? - What's wrong, Dang? I feel nauseated. Help... Wait, Dang. What the... Cik. Aren't they our clothes? Where are we, Cing? Where? Sir. Where are we? My apologies, Cacing. I took the wrong way! Sorry. - Betty? - Betty, who? This is Betty Lamer De La Vega! Transvestite from stop light in Persib Football Field and Tegalega. Yes! Transvestite? Cacing. What are you doing? Open the door! - What happens? - Cacing! - Open the door! - Get out! Let's go! Hurry up, Bet. We're being followed. Don't vomit yet, Dang! No good. He's nauseated! Eyes on the road! Hurry up! Move... Hit the brake! Cing. God forgives me. Get out of the car! Get out of the car! Okay, wait a minute. Get out! Be cool. Calm down. Be calm. Peace. Shut your mouth! - Okay. - Move! - All right. - Move. - Okay. - Get out! Oh, my God. Sir, wait. We are not looking for trouble, Sir. We come here to seek Road Devils. Do you know about it? Can you read? - Of course. - Read this. "Road Devils." What a coincidence. Wait. We have some business with you. Listen, I want to negotiate with you. After all, we're biker gangs. Enough. Biker gangs shall not cause a stir. Biker gangs don't violate the rules. Be calm. Do positive things. Right? Shut up. - We are not looking for commotion. - Yes. We're looking for this! Stop! General. "Melly, Road Devil's General." You're Cacing, right? Right. I am Cacing. It's been a long time I've been curious about you. Really? Girls are curious about me. I'm sure you want to know my phone number, right? I'm not wondering about it. So what? I'm wondering... ... if Cacing could run? Split up! After them! Hurry up! Stop! Come in! Be quick! We can't do anything without our bikes. Like a cat without its fangs. So cute. So sweet. Don't make noise! We'll be safe as long as we are here. I can help you. General! It was, Cing. I am no longer a general. This is General Bro! Coffee, Sir? Coffee, General? In fact, I want to carry out a coup to that new general. And I need your help. Coup... If only we had our bikes here,... ... we'll kick Road Devil's. That's right, Cing. Bike? It's easy, Cing. Easy? Coup... What's wrong with you, Cing? Febi. Why our bikes are in your hand? - Aren't they in the garage? - And padlocked. Let me tell you about it. Be patient. Dadang's bike. Since when a padlock could beat a biker gang? Where's my bike? Sorry, Mul. I didn't bring yours. The car is full. Easy, Mul. You ride with me. What are we waiting for? Let's take our pride from Road Devil. It's them, Cing. - Where? - There. - Over there, Cing. - That's right. Guys, blocking formation. Oh, no, Cing. They're so many. - How dare you! - Stop, stop! Be calm! Be calm, peace. If you're gentlemen, don't be like this. What do you want? I want my company's car, my company's money,... ... and your agreement of repentance. Easy, right? - What's wrong, Cing? - Cough. So what's in it for me? What's in it for you... I'll give you a chance to face the best bikers in Bandung city. - Who are the best bikers, Cing? - Tarix Jabrix. And we'll see... Are you worth it to be a biker gang leader? How dare they? Are you worth it? Beat them, General. Okay. If I lose, I'll fulfil all your demands. But if I win,... I'll take this jacket. - Are you brave enough? - Okay. Deal. Deal. Come on, everyone! Let's go. Okay, are you ready? One, two, three. Bite that! Cacing. Sunbathing, how nice. That's right. Mul, they are here. That's right, Dang. General. Cing. Cing, who win, Cing? Cing. - Of course you win, right, Cing? - You win, Cing? - Bandung is ours! - Yes! You still owe your life to me. Take this bonus. It's okay, Cing. As long as the car returned to us. That's right, Cing. - All hail General! - All hail General! Let's go home. Crazy kids. You're insane. I want to go home. Good. Today... Our car is wrecked. We lost the money. I lost my jacket. Don't forget, our pride is also taken. It's okay, Cing. We're not destined to defeat The Road Devils. Better be we go home. Let's pray the police will catch Road Devils. Today couldn't be worse, huh? My mum. Peace be upon you, Mak. Oh, my good. Are you sure, Mum? Where? But are you all right? All right, Mum. Okay. Peace be upon you too. - What happened, Cing? - Damn. Road Devils attacked my mother. - Cacing's mum was attacked? - Cacing's mum was attacked? Do you know what they said? "Send our regards to Cacing." They made a fuss with us. It's decided. We'll never return to Jakarta before we beat Road Devils. Roger that. But how to beat them, Cing? Be calm. I know the way. Road Devils is so tough today. If you want to beat Road Devils,... ... you shall take a special training. Training? This is the place. Guys. Meet The Crazy Wheels Admiral. AKA Koboi. - Cowboy. - Cowboy. Ko-Bo-ee. I've been in 1,127 accidents. But I'm safe. Thank God. Cool. Legs. Hands. All full metal. People say I am a mentally sick. Koboi. Accept us to be your students. If so... Let's start the training. Training, training. If you want to train with me, you should work hard. Remember, you should train... The balance. "Balance" I know you can, Cing. - Cool. - Go, Cacing. Yeah. It's tickling. Ouch. It's tickling. Koboi. Stop it. So you're more balanced. Discipline. Wake up. I'll count to three. One, two, three. Brino, Blackie, wake them up. Chase them. Wake them up. Wake up! Dog! You're so noisy! What's wrong? Don't be too hard to wake up. The dogs are still chasing. Patience. "Patience." Why Cacing is the only one who eat? We're also starving. His training is so hard. Intake and outtake should be in balance. Who's in the toilet? Be patient. Koboi, I can't take any longer. Be patient, Cacing. Koboi. Be patient. In this life, sometimes we need patience. Remember that. Who's in the toilet? - Be patient, Cing. - Oh, my God, Dadang. And concentration. "Concentration." Now Cacing can focus. - He's thinking dirty. - He's thinking dirty. Hey, Stupid. Stay focused. Okay, Koboi. "Mayang Sari's Photos" Profile Pictures." Mayang? Come on. - You come. - Uncle. Finally you came here. - How are you, Uncle? - Terrific. Mayang. - Dadang? - Yes. The one who helped me? - That's right. - You know her? I know her, Boi Koboi. - Mayang, how are you? - I'm fine. - How are you? - I'm fine. Mayang, I feel bad for your. You came here to take a rest. But I'm with guests. It's okay, Uncle. The more the merrier. Come here, meet Mayang. You all come here. - Ciko. Hello. - Mayang. - Coki. We're twins. - Mayang. Don't get mixed up. - Which one is Coki. - Which one is Ciko. That's right. - Mulder. - Mayang. Muldar, Mulder, Muldar, Mulder. Mulyana Derajat. Caca Sutarya. But you may call me Handsome. Handsome. What a joke. Usually we call you Cacing. Caem "handsome" Cing. Cacing. Enough. Let's go training. - Go to train. - Train. Please come in, Mayang. - Ouch. - Go to train. It's been a long time. - Yes. - What are you doing? - You go to train too. - All right. - Training? - You're a disturber. Go, push up. Come in. Go to train now! Cacing! - Cacing. - Come on, Cacing! - How was it, Om Koboi? - We did it? - We did it. - Yeah. - How was that? - We did it, Cing. - We did it, Koboi? - You did it. All done. Finally it's done, May. - It was so tiring, right? - Yes. I hope they like it. - What's up, Dang? - No problem, May. That... - Cleaned? - Cleaned. Not yet. There is... Come... Cacing. In this life,... ...sometimes we face two choices. Act right, even if we sacrifice our life. Or stop because we're afraid. I had a fear like that too. Really, Koboi? But it's gone now. Because I'm sure my mother always pray for me. Remember. No matter how great you are,... ... mother's pray is always greater. Remember the saying. Mother's love to me... ... is beyond measure all the time. Remember that. Mum. What a good view, right? Do you feel cold? A bit. Mayang, thank you... For helping me. Anytime, Dadang. Moreover, I'm happy too. We could have some fun before... Why are you gossiping? Why don't you go to sleep. Go to sleep... We'll face another tough day tomorrow. What a joke, Cacing. Oh, no. Wait, I'll pick up the phone first. Hello. I'll call you later. Yes. Okay. Dadang, I'll go to bed. Okay, May. We got a letter from Tarix Jabrix. "I demand a rematch! You lose, Road Devils dismissed!" Hurry, read this. You... Read it... "I accept the challenge." "If you lose,... ... Tarix Jabrix shall be dismissed forever." How beautiful. - What? - That's not beautiful. Dismissed forever, Cing. - Dismissed! - I know. I was supposed to say it to myself. How stupid. - Where will you go, Cing? - Training. - Over there, Cing. - There. Cacing is "SIL". - What's SIL? - Secretly In Love. Tada! Awesome! Marvellous. So cool. We can turn on this bike thanks to Dadang. You're like a witch doctor, Dang. This bike is called Si Kumpay. - Awesome. - But now... ... I lend it to you,Cing. - Cing. - Wow! - Cool! - Koboi, stop joking. It's true. If you use this bike, your winning is guaranteed. - Sure, Cing. - I'm ready. - Pray for me, Guys. - Of course. Guys, this won't work... ... without Mayang's help. Thank you, Mayang. Anytime, my friends. But I think... I haven't told you something, right? In fact, I come here to be alone. But turns out so many people right here, right? - I am getting married. - What? Dadang didn't tell us about it. - Not with Dadang. - What? My fiance doesn't like if I still ride bike. One thing for sure... This togetherness with you all... It will make me miss you all. Thanks, my friends. Thanks, Dadang. Uncle. Please take care of my favourite bike. All right. Take care. I'm leaving, Uncle. Dadang, I'm leaving. Thank you. Dang. Don't touch me. Dang. Be calm, Dang. Listen, I promise you,... ... your broken heart will heal... ... when we win the rematch. - Yes. - Of course. Okay? It's thanks to you too. Don't be too convinced. Who was that? Enough with the throwing? In order to win, you also need not only physical strength... ... and sophisticated equipment,... ... but also you need strategy. Relax. Koboi said I passed the training... ... and we have Si Kumpay. - Sure, we'll win. - That's right. The race is not only about game of speed,.. ... but also game of this. - Helmet? - Afro hair? Brain. Brain. Fortunately, I know Road Devils' General weakness. - What is it? - What is it? General never had any boyfriend. Go find a boyfriend for her, Cing. That's right, Cing. If you successfully distract her concentration,... ... your winning is already in your hands. So Cacing shall be General's boyfriend? So you mean... ... I shall use my body... ... to attract that cute General... ... whose smile make the world stop spinning. Right? Okay. For Tarix Jabrix's sake, I'm willing to sacrifice. Cool. General, I am coming. All hail Cacing. All hail Cacing. Vote for Cacing. Vote for Cacing. The all new Cacing. I don't want to be a Deputy CEO anymore. I don't want to be rich... ... if after all this time your money is used... ... to sell our country to the foreigners? My son Mulder, Muliana Derajat. Come with me and I'll tell you everything. No. I better be poor... ... than to cooperate with those economy colonialists. Mul, it's okay if our faces are poor. We should be rich. It's okay if I'm poor. Sorry, Dad, our path is different. Mulder! - Peace be upon you, Dad. - Peace be upon you too. Different path? - I think it's still the same. - Excuse me. This is my path. You're blocking. Okay. Why I don't get any path today? It's so weird. - What happens? - Nothing. - God forgives me. - God forgives me. Cok. That's Melly, Cok. Yes, that's Melly. Sir, what are you doing here? Will you shop? Where will you go? - I forgot. - Pay your food first. How was it? Did you get any info? All is well, Cing. Melly's hobby is swimming. She won poem reading contest when she was in Junior High. - Right. - Her zodiac is Aries. Loves pop songs, loves to eat banana fritters,... ... had her leg broken, allergic to cats,... ... has a married sister with three kids staying in Jakarta,... ... their name are Roni, Abel, Tika, Adina, Ranisa. That's crazy. You know all about that just by following Melly all day long? - Of course not. - Of course not. We looked into her Facebook profile. That's right. I could do that too. So why were you following her all day long? - What did you get? - Easy. - What's that? - This. - Why were you shopping? - Calm and relax. Be calm... Wait here. - Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you. What are you doing? That's Melly. - Of course, Cing, this is her house. - Of course, Cing, this is her house. You stupid. Why didn't you tell me? I'm not ready. It's okay, Cing. Let it flow. Oh, no. She's coming. What are you doing here? Are you following me? Of course no. - I want to... - What do you want? I want to... May I use your toilet? Before we go to race, shall we go on a date? I want to ask you out. Yes or no. Mel, let's go to ride together. In the name of God. Cacing, my bathroom's door is thin. So I heard all you said. You're cool,... ... but stupid. Oh, my God, she thinks I'm cool. Let's go. Why you look dazzled? You said you want to ask me out. So your boldness only exist in toilet? How dare you. Cacing is never afraid of anything. I could ask not only one pretty girl out,... ... I also could ask 12 pretty girls out. Hurry up. So, you are Cacing? Yes. The one who loves to lend his jacket to Melly. - I am Melly's father. - Sir. - Peace be upon you, Sir. - Peace be upon you too. How odd for a biker to know some manner. No wonder you like him. Dad, I'm leaving. - Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you too. Take care. - Sir, I'm leaving. Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you too. Okay, where will we go? I'll take you to a place you'll never forget. What? We ride our own bike? I don't wanna ride with someone... ... whose his riding skill is poorer than mine. You fool. Okay. Mel, will someone steal my bike? This is my home. Nobody dares to rob from Road Devils General's home. Am I understood? Okay. You show off your title. Better than showing off go on a date with 12 girls. Even a general may jealous too. - Even slapping you. - Okay. Keep talking. What are you looking at? No. So fresh. Do you feel cold? No. As if you're strong. We're on a date,... ... and then? What an amazing view. Good atmosphere. The sky's bright. Be more romantic. I am not romantic. Go find another girl if you don't like it. This girl is annoying. What are you doing? Hurry up. Mount Tangkuban Perahu "upturned boat". Where's the boat? But seriously. Amazing. How nice. It feels so fresh. Especially if we... That's a domestic violence. All right. I'll just sit here. I am wondering why this girl is so annoying. Mel, your father... He doesn't know I am in a biker gang. And I don't want he knows. If you dare to tell him... But why doesn't he know, Mel? My dad hates biker gangs. He's paralysed because of them. In fact, I joined a biker gang... ... to defeat those gangs. To revenge my father. But turns out I'm crowned as their General. If your dad knows you're a criminal, will he be sad? I'm not a criminal. My minions need a pride. Now everybody's afraid of Road Devils. Moreover, it's too late. No more ways except to keep going. And tomorrow, they will feel happy once more. Because I make the biker gang the most famous one,... ... The Tarix Jabrix,... ... dismissed. Dang, Dang, come here. Tarix Jabrix will be dismissed. Hurry up. I don't want to arrive late to your home. Your father will be angry to me. I'll speed up. Hold me tight. How was the date? Dad, not sleep yet? Not yet. - Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you too. It was tiring, Sir. - It's okay if you want to leave. - Wait a minute. Melly looks hot-blooded,... ... but she has soft feeling. It's okay, Sir. She hasn't met the right guy. Maybe it could be you. Dad. God Willing. Let's have a dinner together. Come on. All right, Sir. I'm hungry too. - Cacing. - Yes, Sir? Look at this. What is this, Sir? - Family pictures. - Your family pictures, Sir. Who is this, Sir? My late wife. Looks like Melly, right? That's right, Sir. Who is this, Sir? This is Melly from childhood. Is this Melly, Sir? Cute, right? That's not funny, Dad. - But I have the uglier one. - What is that? What is it? - Is this Melly? - Let me see. This was you. - Give it to me. - No. - This is for me. - Cacing! Ouch. Remember, what we did today won't change anything tomorrow. I will still beat you. Or I am the one who will beat you. You were so funny. Why are you laughing? Cacing. Thanks for today. At least,... ... Dad thinks I am like any other girls... ... who make friends. Why should you be like any other girls? You're already special, Mel. Cacing, stop. Stop what? Stop making me feel... Oh, no. What are you doing? You ruined the mood. Let's go home. Ouch. Go Devil! Start. Stop! Road Devils, don't be fooled by those lovebirds... ... like they two. Your General has betrayed. How dare you insult my General. Want a proof? See this proof. What a cool pictures, Cing. So romantic. Enough, there's only one answer. Your General is a betrayer. She sold you all to your enemies. Is that right, General? So this is the reason you came to my home? To ingratiate my Dad,... ... to humiliate me in front of my buddies? I should know this from the start. The race still goes on. Goes on! - Cacing. - Beat him, General. This is Tarix Jabrix's last day in this world. Mel, wait. I can explain. Mel! Mel, wait. This is to kill two birds with one stone. Mel, wait for me! Mel, wait for me! Mel, wait for me! Oh, my God, Mel. Mel, are you all right? Let me explain. I won't trick you, Mel. If there's any, someone must tricked us, Mel. I won't trick someone that I love, Mel. Cacing, stop! Enough with your talking. It makes me think that you really like me. But honestly I love you, Mel. Why should I trust you? Think about it. Between the two of us,... ... it is me who should distrust you. You assaulted my mum, right? - Your mum? - Yes. When did I assault your mum? The thing is, Road Devils have assaulted my mum. Impossible. I won't have my members... ... to attack a woman. Moreover, a middle-aged woman. If it wasn't you,... ... so who did it? - Barokah. - Barokah. Village Head, this is a dedication from our company... ... for your citizens. This is a clean irrigation, Sir. This is my own debt... ... to my hometown, Mr Village Head. I am so confused. What's wrong, Sister? My Cacing. In fact, I always pray everyday... ... so Cacing is beneficial to his parents, family, and village. So what's wrong with Cacing? Look at his behaviour today. Cacing returned to his biker gang. Returned? So what's his reason? Maybe I didn't feed him enough breast milk. I'm sure he lacked of breast milk. - Hey! - Hey! Cing! - Who won, Cing? - Cing, who won? This isn't a matter of winning or losing. Turns out we're tricked. - Tricked? - Tricked by Barokah. - Barokah? - What a moron he is. He brought us into conflict with Road Devils. He also assaulted my Mum. - Your mum, Cing? - Yes. My plan worked. Send my regards to Cacing. - That's him! - That's right! This is my plan. How dare you, Rotten! Hey! It's proven that I'm suitable to be a general. Come face me! You only brave when standing on a statue! What should we do? - Mister General. - General. Bro, we got a task from General. - Full throttle! - Full throttle! My brain is filled by plans and evil strategies. Full with tricks and manipulations. - You bastard! - Cecep, wait. - Come down! - Be calm. - So annoying? - Be calm! - Be patient. - Earthquake. Earthquake! Earthquake! - Earthquake, Sir! - What? An earthquake? - Sir! - What a heavy rain. Kids! Come one! Earthquake hit a village! Come on, Sir! Come here, Sir! - That was an earthquake? - That's right. - Are you all right? - It's okay. - Are you all right? - Help me! Help me, Sir! - Sir. - Sir. - There's a landslide, Sir. - Where? In Cucumui Village, Sir. - Help them now, Sir. - Where is it? - Where will you go? - I will seek for help. - Okay. - Help! - What should we do, Cing? - Landslide! Help! We should help them. - That's right, Cing. - Tarix Jabrix. - Roll out! - Let's go! Cing, I know the shortcut. - We'll help you. - Okay. Wait! Okay, come on! - Road Devils! - Yeah! Where will you go? My story isn't finished yet! - Help! - Mama. Mama! Help! Oh, my God! Stop, stop! Wait! Turn around! - Let's take another way. - Come on. - Come on. - Turn around. Cing, wait. Hello. I can't hear you. Hello, Dad. I am trapped in a house, Mulder. And many citizens are trapped here too, Mulder. Where's the landslide, Dad? Cucumui Village? Hello? Dad? Give it to me. Hello, Mulder? All right. Your mum, Cing. Mum? Peace be upon you, Mum. Hello, Mum? - What happened? - My father said... ... that they are trapped in a landslide, Cing. Mum too? Yes, he stays with your mum, Cing. God forgives me. We can't turn around or we'll be late to reach there. What should we do, Cing? We'll take this road. The bridge can be fixed. But somebody should go across it. But, Cing. Which way? The bridge is heavily damaged. There's only one way. I should leap over the bridge. - But, Cing. - But, Cing. - According to my calculation... - Dang! Enough. Believe me. Cing, even if my Dad is like that, but I swear I love him so much. I believe in you, Cing. Cing. - Mel. - Why? Could we exchange our jackets? For what, Cing? - This is my lucky jacket. - Okay. - Yeah! - Hit the gas! Remember this, mother's love to me is beyond measure all the time. Please pray for me, Mum. In the name of God. Allahu Akbar! - Yeah! - Yeah! Cacing! Cacing! Cacing! Cacing, you aren't supposed to jump, Cing! According to this info, the bridge is impossible to repair. And also not for bikes. Look at that bridge. What's wrong, Cing? Why I am the one to blame? Cacing is certainly stupid! - You stupid! - I'll throw you a stone! Ma'am, help me! - My Mum, Mul. - My Dad, Cing. Come on, Mul. Come on, help them. Come on, over there! Gather the mass. Help them. You all go to the right, I'll help over there. - Mum! - Help! Mum! Dad! Help! Help! Dad! Good afternoon, I am Meriza Febriani. A 5.6 Richter scale earthquake hit West Java. We haven't gotten any news about the isolated victims. This is the amateur footage showing a biker gang... ... we downloaded from Internet. - Okay! - Okay, ladies and gentlemen.

I rode a bike. - Bike? - I dropped in to Uncle Koboi's place. I also brought some helps. They're here. Hello, everybody! Wait for us. I will save you all! Don't be lame. - Hey! - Betti! We're ready to help! Betti, over here! - Good! - Cacing! - Thanks God. - Cacing. - It's okay, Aunt Eruh. - Cacing, Cacing. You're still on spirit, Auntie. - Mum! - Cacing! - Mum, I thought I lost you. - Cacing! Of course not. All thanks to Mulder's Dad, Cing. How come, Mum? Did you know? We're all helped by your Dad. You should be proud of him. This village gets clean water thanks to your Dad. That's the story, Cing. Clean water, Dad? So... Mulder my Son. When the prophet received the first verse of Qur'an,... ... it says, "Iqra." "Read!" You haven't read our company presentation. This year the company plans to maintain the environment. Especially, clean water supplies for the communities. The world is ours. If we don't care about it, who else, Mulder. Mum, please meet her. - Melly, Auntie. - Melly. Without Melly, we won't arrive here just in time, Mum. To help all the victims here. She's awesome, Mum. So, please forgive me, Dad. It's okay. I had bad prejudice to you. I am okay if you choose a pretty girl like her. What is "okay", Mum? Don't make me shy. - Dadang. - Who's that, May? Just help me. Mayang. Stop, stop! How odd you're brave enough to ride a bike? Who said that? I was screaming all the time. So I wear these body protector. Mayang. I know I'm selfish, Mayang. If you aren't ready to marry me, I'll be waiting for you. I'll give you freedom to ride a bike. Under one condition. I sit behind you. Mayang. Love is like a fart. It hurts if you hold it. It's a relief if you release it. I know you can, Mayang. Dang! What's up, Dang? - That's right, Dang. - It's okay. It's okay, Dang. Plenty fish in the sea. Of course. Don't cry, Dang. Who are they? I forgot. They are my friends. Unloads the equipment. - Yes. - You bring some helps. Help this. Hey, Babe. Somebody wants to meet you. Spruce up. Don't be so messy. Spruce up first. Babe, come here. - Where? - This one. Mayang. Mayang. Ma... He fainted. Wake up, Dang. - Dadang! - Dadang. Thank you once again. Thanks to you, we could help the people here. Including my mum. Hey. Why the long face? What's wrong. I am wondering. How to say to my buddies that Road Devils shall be dismissed. A good general... ... may direct their minions toward positive things. Because biker gang isn't criminals. After all, criminals are everywhere. And you're the best general I've ever met. You mean this? You're still so mean. "Donation." For next year's coup. I am a general! Hello! - Hey. - Hey. Mul, what an antique bike. Of course. Because I am Mulder. Caca Sutarya. Congratulations for your success with Tarix Jabrix gang. Thank you so much, Sir. When will you return to Jakarta? Maybe tomorrow or the day after it I'll return to Jakarta. But... I think I cannot return the company's car, Sir. I will replace it, Sir. Can you deduct my salary for it, Sir? After all, who want to ride that car? Right? So we'll meet in Jakarta, okay? All right, thank you, Sir. Let's go. Hey. You are Tarix Jabrix? That's right, Sir. Good. Congratulations! I like you all.
