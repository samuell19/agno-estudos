Why didn't you knock me cold and do it to me? Hey, baby, go ahead and finish your drink. That's all, finish your drink. - No! Now, please, I want you to tell me why. Why didn't you? Because I might've hit you in your natural, stone-cold head and fractured your skull. That doesn't make any sense. You were gonna cut my throat with a gold letter opener anyway, weren't you? Yeah, mama, and that's still my intent. You're not telling me the truth. I don't have to answer any of your questions. No, that's true. You don't, but as long as you're going to kill me, why not be open and frank with me, huh? Well, yeah... Soon as I finish my cocktail, I'm gonna show you. No! Now, I want you to tell me right now! Now, you just tell me now, why you did not knock me unconscious and take what you wanted? 'Cause you had to be awake, understand? Is that enough for you, mama? Oh, no. No, no. No. God damn it, mama, you embarrassing me. You're embarrassed?! How do you think I feel?! Now, I want you to tell me, just sit down, have your drink, and tell me why? Why didn't you do it? Just tell me why. You can be frank with me. I took a course in psychology. Tell me. You know, it's amazing. A girl your age with all that sexual experience. Well, if you wanna know, I was molested when I was 11 years old in the orchestra of Loews Orpheum Theatre in New York. It was a Saturday matinee by a guy who smelled something like you. An old guy. How do you mean smell? Do you ever notice the way, uh... all those theaters used to smell the same? The same with all the RKO houses. Only they had still a different smell. You know that certain, um... bottled smells. But you remarked on my smell. Maybe that's the way, um, perverts smell who bother little kids. [chuckles] I never had any such interest. I hated to sit in the children's section. All those kids screaming, blowing into their candy boxes. You couldn't hear the dialogue. So, in a dark scene, I slipped out of my seat and crossed the aisle into the adult section. And then, in the back, I see a flashlight blink on, and the matron would start coming down the aisle. And I slide over next to a grown-up, and I whisper, "Say I'm with you, say I'm with you. Say I'm your daughter. Tell her to go away." And sometimes, they would. This guy did. Then he went back, and he bought me popcorn and a Pepsi-Cola and Black Crows. I know I was sitting there with the popcorn in one hand and the Pepsi in the other hand, and my mouth was full of Black Crows. He reached under my skirt and pulled my underpants down. Horrible... I just pretended he wasn't doing anything. Watched Howard Keel and pretended I was up there, not down in the dark with those ice cold fingers. He must've washed his hands in cold water when he went back for candy 'cause they were like ice. There's never any hot water in theaters. You should've cried out. The matron would've come and turned her flashlight right on his hand, and I never would've been able to go back that that Loews. Besides, those Black Crows get stuck to your teeth, and they make it very hard to yell. What else did he do to you? You shoulda reported it. - To Loews?! Suppose they woulda kicked me out for good, said that I was making it up? They wouldn't. They couldn't. You were a child. That's what you know. Did you ever read the back of your ticket? No, you never read it. They don't want you to read it. That's why they tear it up before you can read it. I'll tell you what it says. Are you ready for this? "The management reserves the right to relinquish the license granted by this ticket by refunding the purchase price." How do you like that shit? Is it significant? It's full of big words that a little kid can't understand! It means that they can kick you out for any reason at all just by giving you your money back. Is that so terrible? Have you ever been kicked out of the movies? Then you don't know. Being hauled through the lobby by the usherette, standing out there, looking at all the glasses, knowing that you'll never get to see that scene? Where did they expect me to go? Home? Home, for Christ sake? Now, that was a long time ago, you were a child. You shoulda told your mother, she woulda-- I did finally. And you know what she said? Nothing. Like she didn't hear. She told me to tidy my room, and then she stared away from me. She never really looked at me after that. She didn't wanna hear it, so she didn't. You don't know what it's like. I do. I do, I-I have to think a while, but smells do b-bring back memories, like-like a dime novel. You know about dime novels? Nick Carter, Doc Savage, Street & Smiths. The aroma of that cheap, rough paper under your pillow. Huh? Right? Yeah... You see, it takes time, but I made the connection. You used to read those? Well, actually, I-I used to collect them, used ones. Sold 'em to the other kids. - You sold them? - Oh, I had hundreds, sure, yes, I sold them. The real raggedy ones went four for a dime, but Street & Smiths, they were a nickel a piece. Creep! You do smell like him! That molester? I don't! I swear I don't! - I'll never forget him. - You were eating popcorn! You couldn't smell anything anyway. - You are the right age. - I don't go to the movies. It's-It's a waste of valuable business time. Twelfth row from the front? Seven Brides for Seven Brothers? I hate musicals! Now, young lady, you stay away. Dark, like it was then. Turn that light back on. Young lady, you are dangerously ill. [grunts] Holy Jesus, let go, please, please! Let-- Let go! Watch the movie. I'll get you some popcorn. Some nice, hot, buttered popcorn, wouldn't you like that? And I can get you a Heath bar, you ever had one? They're very soft on the outside and very hard on the inside. And I can get you a Three Musketeer bar. That's my favorite. You can nibble the chocolate around the front. I love you. [grunts] ♪♪ See, I, uh... generally can't do it unless the lady fights back. I let her hit me a few times, get a few good scratches in. Scratching generally does it for me. Well, didn't I? I mean, I know that I kicked you a lot. No, kicking turns me off. Scratching? Oh, I don't have any nails. I can't grow the damn things. I take gelatin. - No, no, no, no, I say it's not your fault, lady. You know, lately, I've been getting the shit clawed out of me, but, uh... It don't stir nothing up. [sigh] Well... [sigh] Disappointment, like today, well, that, uh... makes me feel bad. No, damn it, I'm-I'm making excuses. Is it because I'm white? Well, if your husband had come back with the bread, I wouldn't have to go through all this. I know, this is... this is demoralizing. I mean, what kind of a rapist am I? Well, I don't know... I've never met a rapist before, but... I guess, like everybody today, you're... you're under great social pressures. Well, when I was 16, you know, I, uh, you could've called me "boy," you know, the whole idea of being with a white chick was like a fantasy, you know, a-a "stay away from her, Jack." You know, verboten. How 'bout that shit. [chuckles] "Lynch him." And the white girls, they were terrified, Jack, stone-terrified. I remember. Used to, I'd slip into a house where a white chick was, you know, and just, just stand there, just reveal myself, Jack, you know, [chuckling] just fucking stand there. She'd scream, you know. "Why, there's a nigger in my house!" Hey. Didn't I-I read about you in the newspapers? Yeah, you were never caught. The unidentified negro, you know. [sigh] Now, you go to a movie house and... "Why there it is on the screen. How about that? Mixed couples all over the place." No, they went and took all the mystery out of it. Yeah. Now, they're treating us like people. You can see what kind of position that puts a rapist like me in. Damn it. I had it all worked out. I have a nigger mystique. I talk nigger talk, you know? I'd walk a nigger walk. I had it made. Then they changed it. They changed it all around, and I found myself slippin', and there I was, you know, I was, I was holdin' on to the past because change is scary And then they said, "Re-educate yourself. Learn new trades." What trades? The pool man part or the shoeshine boy in me? What trades? I only know how to do one thing. At least I'm... I used to know how.
