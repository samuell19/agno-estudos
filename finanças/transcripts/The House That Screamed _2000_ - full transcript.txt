By the year 2000, most of the mysteries will have been solved. Except for one: The question of life after death. What happens to our souls? Do we go to a higher plane of existence or do we wander forever... while we see others continue to live? We'll never know. But sometimes restless souls stay here and don't go to the afterlife. Their supernatural existence is a terrible game... and they throw themselves into what they don't own: life. Fantomas, ghosts or apparitions. Innocent people are besieged by these forces... and flee, go mad or commit heinous acts... "against others or themselves." Ghost appearances can happen anywhere... and can last several days or even centuries. Haunted houses are almost everywhere. Even in your street. Maybe you live in it. Appearances can be deceptive. This is a haunted house. This is a haunted house. This is a haunted house. Where the hell am I? I don't have a nut on this either. Excuse me. Can you tell me where the real estate office is? Two blocks further and then the first one on the left. Thank you. Thank you. Hey, you're Marty Beck, the famous horror writer. - Yeah, that's right. - I've read all your books. Then you're a masochist. - What are you doing in this hamlet? - Research. Would you like to sign one of your books? I'm in a hurry. Shall I send you a copy of my last book? That would be great. You don't even know my name. White Pine brokerage. What can I do for you? And what's the famous Marty Beck doing here? I'm working on a new book and I want to rent a house for a few weeks. Have you seen the videos? We have some beautiful houses. The house I'm looking for isn't on it, Mr Kilpatrick. What exactly are you looking for? I want to stay in the haunted house. The house on Wingate Road? The house on Wingate Road? Why? It's the perfect inspiration for my book. Beck, I don't know what they told you... "but we don't have any haunted houses here. Go to Hamming Hill." I looked there before I came here. I don't believe in the supernatural... but it's the perfect place to write, a real haunted house. The publicity is already worth thousands of extra copies. There's something in that. But you writers are weird guys. Have you ever met a filmmaker? You've been doing research. So you know about the "accidents"? Yeah, they had nothing to do with ghosts and demons. Writers believe everything they write down, don't they? Not this one. Okay, I'll show you. Let me get the key. Come on, let's take my car. Doesn't look spooky. It's only a haunted house if someone calls it that. Good call. Okay, let's take a look inside. That was the 10-cent tour. I'll take it. I'll send somebody to clean up the mess from the previous tenants. - Never mind. - Sure? I just want to write here. And I'm moving in tonight. Then all we have to do is sign the contract in my office. That'll be 15 bucks. No, cash. I've never seen you here before. Where do you live? The house on Wingate Road. The haunted house? Good luck. Day1. House of Terrors Marty Beck. Oh, my God. Not bad for the first eighteen pages. Why do you always whine like that? When are you gonna stop writing? It's never gonna work out. Face reality. Get out of here. That's nice. I'm coming. Beck, how are you? All right, I'm writing. - Everything okay? - Only a few jokers knocking. I should have warned you. Kids having fun. Because you're new here. Yeah, I guess so. I'll stop by. Good luck with your book. Now what? What are you doing here, little girl? - What are you looking at? - Your son Billy. He died in a fire. He's dead. Not anymore. He's my playmate. Then where is he? Day2. This is fantastic. Now what? - So you're the new tenant? - Yeah. You scared me. That's the way I am. Where do you live? In the neighborhood. You're lucky with this house. - I'm only renting it for a while. - It's a great place. It's a great place. If it were alive, man or woman, I'd make love to it. Yeah, it is. Do you want a cigarette? You look familiar. I write horror books. I write horror books. - Maybe I know you from that. - Have you read Feeders 1, 2 and 3? No. No. Anyway, that Fremain is the best. - So, have you seen any ghosts? - What do you mean? - This is a haunted house. - Nonsense. When I walk by at night, they're looking at the window. Who's at the window? The dead, the ghosts. But don't let them scare you. - Oregon Press. It's Sal. - With Marty. - Marty. How's your book coming? - Good. Ask the boss if he'll send some money. I need to stay here a little longer. Marty, you're fucking bothering me. Boss didn't like this. - Say it's gonna be worth it. - You said that six weeks ago. He earns enough on those stupid alien books, the filthy miser. Okay, don't get excited. I'll talk to him tomorrow. Thanks, Sal. But he won't like it. Where were you all of a sudden this afternoon? - My mother called me. - I didn't hear anybody. - Why are you afraid of me? - I'm not afraid of you. Good. I haven't had a husband in a long time. I want to feel your hands. I want to feel your weight on top of me. I want to feel you inside me. Fuck with me, Marty. Fuck me in there. Oh, my God. Day3. What? You've got to be kidding me. No. Did any of the previous tenants ever tell you anything like that? No, but they weren't as obsessed with those things as you are. - You really didn't swallow anything? - I don't do drugs. I don't do drugs. All I know is that what I felt was real. At least it seemed that way. If you were so scared, why didn't you leave? I wanted to, but... I can't explain it. It was like I couldn't. Or didn't really want to. And it's great for a book. I've never written so well. Your artists, too... A weird couple, you know. - Am I really not gonna find anything else? - No, that's not necessary. A man spent the night once because he had car trouble. What's his name again? Gillette, Gilman... Gilson, Jack Gilson. He works at the power plant. Maybe he can help you. -Thank you. I'll see you around. Call me if you need anything. Mr. Gilson? Come in, Marty Beck. I'm here, guys. There must be money in the house. My God, in the basement. I'm here to -To talk about the house. The house is alive. It knows what you're thinking, it knows what you're feeling... "it knows things you don't already know." I'm writing a book. What happened the night you stayed there? Stayed? I wasn't staying, I was being held. By ghosts? If you don't keep interrupting me, I can tell my story. Okay, asshole? I had bad luck with my car and decided to walk into town. After a while I came to the house. I should have known better. I should have seen the devils behind the window. But something forced me to walk to the door and go inside. What I saw out there would make a dead man scream. The more I tried to get these horrors away from me... "the worse they got." What did you do? I ripped my eyes out. But I still saw them. Now get the fuck out of here. They're worthless. You don't want them anymore, do you? Get the hell out of here before I hurt you. My daddy hurt me so much. I had to punish him. I killed him, just like I'm gonna kill you. Now what? You publishers are always worried. There's nothing to worry about. I was just working on the book. It's gonna be a bestseller. Count on it. Okay, all right. If only I could interview one. Sit down, sit down, sit down. Do you want to talk to me? Why? I'm writing a ghost story and I could use some information. Yes, I agree. - Who are you? - I don't remember. - How did you get here? - I've always been here. Don't you remember anything? I remember a war. A war? What war? - When brothers fought brothers. - The Civil War? Yeah, that war. - Did you get killed in that? - I don't remember. Please, try. I was shot. What's it like to... What's it like to be dead? Cold, lonely, painful. Please don't get upset. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Grief is the only emotion I feel. Are you responsible for the things that happen here? - Aren't you the only one? - No. No. - How many more? -Lots. - Lots. - Like you? -No. - No. Explain. I don't understand. They're different. They'd never let you talk to them. - They are cruel, depraved souls. - Why are they here? Why are they here? They're prisoners, waiting to be redeemed. - What do you mean? - One day you'll understand. - Why aren't the others showing up? - You wouldn't want to see them. Why don't you? Why don't you? Because they'll hurt you. - Have you heard enough? - Yeah. Thank you. I wish I could help you. - Do your part and you'll be fine. - Help me understand. Go into the belly of the Beast if you want to understand the screaming house. I don't understand what you're saying. Who are you? What do you want? I said, who are you? Go into the belly of the Beast if you want to understand the screaming house. There must be another room here. Oh, my God. What does this mean? There's no more room for us. You're our only salvation. Don't talk in riddles. These spirits want to live, but will never be among the living. Our fate is linked to yours and you are the key. Why is that? What's my role in this? You will upset the balance between the living and the dead. They will be redeemed and the cycle begins again. How? Do I have to die? No, you have to take your own life. It upsets the balance. - Only then can the ghosts get out of here. - I'm not committing suicide. You can't make me. I'm leaving and I'm never coming back. You can't go. You were meant to be here. That's why you came here. No, I don't believe in a predestined lot. You didn't believe in us either. You've got to help me. I can't interfere. I can't interfere. The dead are not meant to be with the warm, breathing flesh. I have no influence on it. Get ready, Marty Beck. Day4. Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. - Good morning, sir. White Pine brokerage. - May I speak to Mr Kilpatrick? May I? Mr Kilpatrick isn't here. Where can I reach him? It's urgent. That's not gonna work. He's been dead for two years. I talked to him yesterday and he rented me this damn house. - Impossible. Which house do you mean? - On Wingate Road. I don't know who you are, but that house has been empty for years. Mr Kilpatrick died in that house. Everyone says it's haunted. That's right. Marty, what is it? Marty? You're dead. You're dead. Marty, you're absolutely right. Hold that gun to your head and blow your fucking brains out. Then you're out of the shit. Then stay here until you die. We have all the time in the world, but you don't. What else can you do, Marty? It's getting late. Do you think you'll last another night? I doubt it. See you in hell, Beck. What the fuck do you want? - Marty, we need to talk. - Now and if. The deal's off. The boss doesn't want a horror story. - Nobody pays for it, he says. - Say that to them. - Are you having a party there? - Yeah, I'm waking up the dead. Yeah. I have to hang up. I have other things on my mind. I don't want to hear from you anymore. And the cycle begins again. Translation: Viduce BV
