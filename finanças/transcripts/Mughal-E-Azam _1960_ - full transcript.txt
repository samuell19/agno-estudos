Sterling Investment Corp. Ltd. presents K. Asif's MUGHAL-E-AZAM - the great Mughal I am India The Himalayas guard my boundaries The Holy Ganges is the witness to my chastity Since the beginning of time... I have been a friend of darkness and light The foundations of marble monuments that rise from my ashes, lie embedded in deeper depths than of Earth herself. Tyrants robbed and ravaged me... well-wishers adorned me Fools chained me... those who loved me broke those chains Among those who loved me there was... one named Jal Al-u-Din Mohammed Akbar Akbar loved me Standing high above the divisions of religion and tradition... he taught people to love one another And he held me in his embrace for ever This is the palace of Emperor Akbar Now its every nook and cranny... can tell stories of bygone days Far from the comforts... of his splendid palace... in this scorching desert... walking barefoot on the burning sand... is Akbar the Great There is despair in his eyes because... for he has not yet fathered an heir. Akbar's pilgrimage is to a hermitage... of the Holy One, Sheikh Salim-u-din Chisti... in the hope that through his prayers... God might bless Akbar with a son In the entire Imperial caravan... Akbar the Great alone had vowed to walk on foot At last he reached his destination The Emperor, before whom the world bowed... bowed his head before a fakir Seek as one should seek, for God never refuses the entreaty of his devotees Raise your hands in prayer... I shall join you O Emperor of Emperors Thous hast bestowed upon this humble man... every blessing that life has to offer. I have been called Protector of the World, and Shadow of God Let me now hear a voice that calls me father O Master of the Two Worlds... let Akbar not die without an heir. He shall bless Queen Jodha with a child Congratulations, Your Majesty Allah has blessed you with a son... and heir to the Mughal Empire Praise be to Allah! You have brought happy tidings to the dispirited soul of Akbar Take this ring as a token. Keep it with you as a mark of my promise. I swear by these sacred Scales of Justice that once in your lifetime, whatever you may request of Akbar ... shall be granted In the passage of time... the Prince revealed his mischievous nature Prince! These scales are not your playthings Are they the Emperor's playthings? - No The sacred scales are a memorial to Emperor Babar, and they signify Mughal justice How profound. Prince, please learn these words you will say in the Court It is a command? - No, a request Then I shall try The Prince became more and more disobedient and he overstepped the bounds of protocol and respect Take this and let it float on the currents of Jamuna The grandeur of Mughals began to waver... and the intoxicated Prince Salim started staggering To Akbar the Great... the future of India seemed bleak ??? It is an evil day... when the symbol Mughal Justice becomes the plaything of a profligate Prince Mansingh Take him away from his mother's lap ... and clad him in armour Temper its steel in the scorching sand-storms of the desert I entrust you with the future of the Mughals A child belongs to its mother's lap, not to the shadow of war Lord, grant me that my love may shield my son from the enemy swords The Prince sends his chain of mail from the battlefield Salim! My Salim! Salim has performed his duty as we would have wished Salim, my darling, my child! Is this the magnificent Empress of India? No, Your Majesty. Merely a mother. I was not aware that a mother's weakness would make Queen Jodha forget her dignity Your Majesty, does Mughal rule... not allow a mother to pine and weep... when her son's blood is pitilessly shed? She may pine, but not weep If all the mothers of other sons on the battlefield were to weep... then all India would be drowned in tears Distribute gold among the poor equal to the weight of this armour For 14 years, Prince Salim was tempered amidst the storms of battle in the deserts. He became a victorious general. Have the Prince's wounds not been dressed yet? We are not allowed to enter. The surgeon is waiting, Prince. Don't you want your wounds to be dressed? They are not wounds, but flowers For flowers to wilt is an insult to spring Hear this: It is not only an assassin but also a beloved... It is a rose-bough and also a sword Surely, this dumb sword is no princess in a romance? Not merely with the eyes of a soldier do I see this piece of steel, nor as the warrior who wields the sword only in blood-letting Then what is it that the Prince wields? In my hand, this dancing blade is like a woman in throes, in her lover's arms Then rises the blood, that spreads in a blush over her face After 14 years of bloodshed you are still soaked in poetry? Astonishing There is nothing astonishing about it. Would an Omar Khayyam verse change if it were written in stone... instead of gold? - No. Then whatever plans the Emperor may have for me, they are based on error. The armour you wore in the victorious battle is to be sent to His Majesty. Are these years of my bloodied youth not enough? Not the armour. I'd rather send this story of my life to His Majesty, written with blood and ashes And none is better fitted to deliver it to His Majesty than my faithful son, Durjan. Ride with the despatch Attention all ye ??? praise to God The Mighty One's foresight has been proven right The Prince has emerged victorious again ??? hear hear How many wounds did the Prince receive? Countless. Many blows fell, but the swords were blunted They could but not salute the prince's courage and Akbar's blood hear hear ??? We shall inspect his armour Instead of his armour, the Prince has sent this message Let it be read aloud The Emperor of India, Jal Al-u-Din Mohammed Akbar Sire, here is the account of every morsel of the land... soaked with the blood of your heir For 14 years, this land engulfed in the flames of war... has sucked your blood which flows in my veins The flames are extinguished... but there is still blood in Salim's body Command me, and I shall stain the valleys of the south with my blood Sire, your humble servant, Salim All praise to Allah! Today Salim has become our heir Chief Scribe Send a command to Prince Noor-ud-din Mohammed Salim to return to the Court Felicitations to His Majesty on Prince Salim's return Felicitations on Prince Salim's return O Lord, you are silent. Let me see Salim's face His Majesty has ordered Durjan Singh to bring the prince back to the Court Bahaar, Bahaar, you have come with a message of joy to dry our tears I shall reward you with plentiful pearls Far too little, Your Majesty. I want the prince to walk on a carpet of pearls, when he returns And more than that, Bahaar. For Salim, everything! My son is returning after many years I shall ask the Emperor to let my son be with me for a few days He has learnt his father's manner of rule... but he hasn't known yet the love of his mother Tell the Court Dancers to prepare an elegant dance... to erase the fiery images of war from Salim's eyes And tell Tansen to compose such sweet melodies for Salim's welcome that he will forget the bellow of cannons And flowers! Bahaar, surround Salim with everlasting spring Make a thousand moons glow for my son Where his steps fall, let there be an astral carpet And wherever he glances, let there be heaven All that my heart yearns for but cannot express O Lord, let that auspicious moment come soon when my eyes may behold my son. Then, for a moment, I might even forget You. Sculptor Sculptor The Spring (Bahaar) of the palace in my deserted workshop? I want to chose a statue for the Prince The princes and emperors do not appreciate my statues Why not? - Because they speak the truth This is the Imperial Court, every word of the Emperor is law. None can appeal against it And here is a battlefield The innocent blood of millions shed for the triumph of one man And this is the price for speaking the truth Punishment by death This isn't the truth, sculptor. It's just an artist's rhetoric. - Meaning? The mind accepts the beauty of your art, the heart does not What good is a statue if a proud head is not humbled before it? Then I will make such a statue that at its feet a warrior will lay his sword... a king his crown... and a man his heart What are you doing? This crown should be presented to the wearer One is crowned by another's hands, but with one's own courage Bahar, have you no fear that someone might see you? Fear? No crown is worn on a head that fears You wish to become queen of this great empire? So many other girls dream the same Let them dream Look into my eyes Like the eyes of a drunkard who jabs his sword at the skies Do you plan to pluck the stars from the sky? Sometimes the stars fall down to earth For a vain Prince, one submissive glance of mine is enough As with death, so it is with the hearts of Princes ??? You can never know when I wish for it the soonest ??? Your Majesty, only three more hours till daybreak Here is the last pearl of the night's time-keeping ??? Let the price of this pearl be paid Is the Emperor welcoming his son wearing armour? We are not welcoming our son, but a great warrior of India Your Majesty, I have not seen Salim since he was a child. Don't let him come to me unannounced. Mistress, the Prince has entered the palace Will I get a reward, to save the Prince from the evil eye? The Emperor has welcomed the Prince himself! Before he could bow, the Emperor embraced him! The Prince has crossed the Inner Court. The slaves have sighted him There are carpets of flowers to welcome him, but he cares naught for the pomp, he comes near with firm steps The Emperor has granted permission to the Prince to enter alone - The Prince has arrived Salim! Is the world swaying with joy, or am I swooning? Bahaar, help me After so many years, in what voice will he call me mother? How shall I hear the sound of this new voice? The word "mother" will sound in my ears and in my heart. I hope that sound won't stop my heart's beat. Mother Mother Open your eyes, mother, look at me. I am here Salim, you have grown so big I was used to seeing you when you were just knee-high Bow down a little, Salim So you have become a great warrior How cruelly you have shed my blood Did you not think how these wounds would alarm your mother? If you had but once called out to me on the battlefield... lullabies would have flown from the clash of swords The battlefield would have become a mother's lap But you never cried out to me Salim, my child Bahar, take him away, or the evil eye might be upon me Eyes long to glimpse you... paths await your steps # "On an auspicious day the Prince has returned" Who is hiding from me, Bahar? Not hiding, but hidden, Prince The sculptor claims that when this statue is unveiled... Speak. Sometimes such claims are interesting On seeing this statue a warrior will lay his sword at its feet... a king his crown and men their hearts The claim is too interesting to resist I shall view his arrogance It is His Majesty's order that the prince should not see the statue now The Royal Astrologer says it will be a bad omen... if the Prince looks at any statue before this moon has set His Majesty will attend the unveiling tomorrow morning On one hand, the sculptor's claim; on the other hand, the omen And the statue is shrouded How can I wait until morning, Durjan? The Sculptor's claim is justified Only stone can endure the power of infinite beauty I am tempted to accept the divinity of idols The Prince would be accused of idolatry But also praised for appreciating art Nadira, the sculpture isn't ready yet. You must pose for it tomorrow again The Prince has seen me; he has praised your art - Within that praise is also a secret love for you. - Love for whom? For you Attention all ye! The Emperor cometh! ??? - Your slave begs to make a suggestion - you may In the legends, unveiling was done with an arrow We like your suggestion Prince, let the legend come true Your Majesty, it shall be done Praise be to Allah! It seems an angel has descended from heaven... and taken form in marble I am no angel, but a human being Then who forced you to become a statue? A persistent sculptor of your realm who wishes to remain unknown His strange sense of the arts is indeed praiseworthy But why did you stand still when the arrow was shot? I wanted make a legend come true Splendid! We admire your courage Queen Let her be one of your maids We bestow the title of Anarkali on her Tomorrow, when we celebrate Lord Krishna's birthday, Anarkali... will be a suitable Radha You have taken the words out of my mouth # Krishna teased me on the banks of the Jamuna... # Krishna teased me on the banks of Jamuna... # He twisted my delicate wrists # Krishna teased me on the banks of the Jamuna # He cast a pebble at me, and broke my pitcher # He broke my pitcher... # He left me drenched # Krishna teased me on the riverbanks... # With his eyes, he cast a spell; he won my heart # He won my heart # With his eyes, he cast a spell; he won my heart # He won my heart... # My veil he pierced with a mere look # On the riverbanks, Krishna teased me What is it, Suraiya? - Someone is in love You are. - You're insane Who can I be in love with? - With the one who's in love with you - By God! - Who? - The Prince - Be silent, Suraiya! - You can't order me to be quiet, until you are Queen - Suraiya! For God's sake, how can a slave dare to entertain such dreams He is the Crown Prince, the future Emperor of India So what? No doubt emperors come from God, but their queens can come from anywhere You're naive. What possible relation can exist between heaven and earth? Then what do you want to be? - Just a slave. - But the Prince's slave It will be a calamity if someone hears you mention his name People will hear of it, as always with love affairs. I know Then why be afraid of getting a bad name? I am not afraid of getting a bad name. I don't want him to get a bad name. - Then say farewell to love - If you have courage, come with me - Where? To a place where someone's eyes are longing to see you I cannot face those eyes right now Let me stay here Stay, then. But I have the courage to face him Suraia, have you lost your senses? That's it: I'll ask the Prince why people who see him lose their senses Suraia, even yearnings would amount to insolence in his presence That might be true if he had no yearnings himself But now, love has put him in a state where he can no longer perceive insolence Suraiya! Suraiya, Suraiya! What is the matter? Why are you calling Suraiya? Oh, I'm so afraid, Mother! Why have you come here? - I just came With whose permission? - My heart's Begone! I won't Allow her, Durjan What do you want? To find out why those who look at you lose their senses Who says so? - My sister Nadira, who has lost her senses Insolent girl My name is Suraiya And your sister calls you Suraiya? She used to. - And now? Now she has forgotten all names but one The Prince Take this message to your sister Such a letter could be dangerous, Prince Fall in love, and you will lose fear Sister, why so dreamy? Take this letter What letter? From the Prince. - Allah! Pray to Allah and you'll get another letter It quivers: Perhaps the Prince's heart is in it Take it No You gave your heart so quickly. To take another's, why do you tarry? I woke up to find Anarkali in my soul, beautiful Anarkali Accept my salutations A sadness hangs heavy on my restless heart Day and night I think of you and my desire. I shall die! he loves me! Tonight I'll wait for you in the Western Garden Place your reply in a lotus and send it floating down the stream I cannot forget you, O beloved, I await your reply Salim She refuses? Reason? Because she is only a slave girl and unfortunately, I am a prince And both positions are irrevocable. And I am a human being; that, too, is irrevocable The heart sought sustenance from the song and went beyond its limits Prince, the sun illuminates every corner of the universe Why, then did the sun trouble to step in here? To become one with the moon For God's sake, do not lower your princely status You are the master, I am only a servant Today I shall break down this wall that separates high and low Sit down, Anarkali Prince Anarkali, look at me I want to see the confession of my love reflected in your eyes Do not look into my eyes, Prince You will see nothing but the fearful longing of a slave Forget you are a slave. Let Salim read in your eyes what you fear to say Do not take away my dreams, Prince - It would kill me - Anarkali I shall make those dreams come true Daughter, where are you? Prince! - Let her see me I can suffer taunts, but not your disgrace Oracle, tell me what will happen? What is to become now? ??? ??? What does that augury mean, sister? It means: My heart has escaped me May the world never know the pain hidden in it God knows what's come over you. Aren't you afraid of loneliness? And he's always asking about you. Come with me No Suraiya, I fear the world... might read my secret thoughts on my face Nadira ... Nadira Nadira, why have you been so depressed of late? If you avoid other people, they will say you've become proud ever since the Emperor raised you. Allah! Who can call a helpless person proud? Enemies cannot be stopped from talking What do you know of the palace gossip? Welcome, Bahaar You must take her under your wing. - Don't worry I have come to take her with me. - Bless you! Take care of her Anarkali, how beautiful is your new name Indeed Like Shama, the pretty candle that feeds its wax to the flame Since you have become Shama (flame), why fear moths? What moths? Me, for instance. Why not join our performances sometimes? Performances? I have arranged a musical contest. I would be nice if you took one part of the stage And? - And I the other And? - The arbiter of our performances will be the Prince. # In your court, I will try my destiny # For a few moments, I will see what it means to be close to you # In your court... I will try my destiny too # At your feet, I will lay my head # Spring comes bearing the news of love # After ages, I see hope # After ages, I see hope # I will save myself from the agony... # What fun is a life bereft of any grief? # What fun in shedding tears, without any grief? # I will shed tears in love # In your court, I will try my destiny too # This is what happens to those who fall in love # They suffer in silence... and die a miserable death # I will see this farce and amuse myself # In your court, I will try my destiny too # Love, I concede, ruins your life # But isn't it enough that you are remembered long after you are dead? # I will ruin myself for my love # At your feet, I will lay my head # A few moments, I will spend with you # In your court, I will try my destiny too To love in secret, to die for love ...the lover's dream The only story for lovers is to pine, heave sighs, and choke to death We shall see, some day, this spectacle - with a smile Your opinion of love deserves this flower And you Anarkali, would rather be in love and be devastated For what more can one ask for but remembrance, after one is gone We shall see, by staking our world for someone's love For that you get these thorns I am fortunate Thorns live not in fear of fading What is, Mansingh? Papers concerning the Ajmer province at the disposal of His Majesty - At my disposal? - Yes, Sire Does Mansingh not know that we have given Ajmer to the Prince? - I know, Sire. - Then why these papers? Revolt may break out in the province; circumstances oblige me to inform you So it has gone this far? Why have you not reminded the Prince of his responsibilities? The papers were presented to him many times, but... But what, Mansingh? I was unable to find out the reason behind the Prince's negligence Then I shall! Durjan, convey my message to the Prince, the Governor of Ajmer... to issue the instructions in these papers forthwith... and also tell him I wish to know... the reason for his negligence I'll tell her that. - And also tell her... that without her Salim's life is as dark as the night And? while waiting, Salim is losing himself in oblivion and ... ? that ??? His Majesty's message... is that the instructions in these papers be issued forthwith Durjan, are you an enemy of love, to appear at this moment? Prince, I am your friend You get yourself a friend too, then you may also receive messages Quiet, girl! - My name is Suraiya; and you are forgetful Prince, I have seen the fire of anger in the Emperor's eyes Stop this dangerous game, otherwise people will begin to talk # O'Love, this world... # has nothing but words of resent # They know not what pain the anklets bear # All they can hear is its chime # In every heart... # is hidden Cupid # But all they can see... # is restraint # What sweet a pain they bear... # ask those in love # Whom Cupid's arrow has struck... # none can reason with # For all the repression... # they dare to meet # love does wonders # So what if you can't see the bees now...? # So what if you can't hear the fireflies...? # They all sing the song of love # And talk about their sweethearts # O'Love, this world... # has nothing but words of resent Curtains on the more colourful aspect of life Time to pay attention to mundane matters Sister What has happened to me, Suraiya? Why don't you ask where I have been? You know that your sister is always lost in her thoughts Remain so, then. I've no time to carry messages hither and thither. Goodbye Did you meet him? What did he say? yes, I did - what was he saying? - With that madness of yours I shall not tell you Tell me, or you shall see my funeral The Prince met me in the garden. - Then? He had the look of one who had not slept all night He asked: How is your sister? Then he took my hand and asked: "Is she in the same state as I am?" What did you say? I said he was right. And he kissed my forehead Then what happened? - He said: Tonight, when Tansen starts to sing his raga... tell your sister to meet me in the Western Garden Why feel embarrassed to kiss my forehead? Because the Prince also...? - I had forgotten that Sweet forgetfulness. But the Prince kissed my forehead twice # "Being a devotee of love..." # "I got in search of my handsome love" # "When our eyes meet..." # "my thirst will be quenched" Prince, someone is watching us! The impudent person who has dared to come here, is to appear in my palace Your servant is here I rue my fate that the dagger failed to find its mark. And I lament my wretched life Prince, give one more chance of victory to the insolent dagger There is still much blood left in my bosom Bahaar What does a candle flame know? Murmurs of the night, and secrets For that reason every candle flame is extinguished at the break of day Prince? You too have tried to unravel a secret You, too, could be extinguished You may go now Anarkali (pomegranate blossoms) They are in full bloom in the Palace Garden Maybe Your Majesty has not noticed And I have not seen our Anarkali of late, either Her plaintive voice shall soothe our weary mind Summon her She cannot come right now. Why not? With Salim, Anarkali shall reign as Queen of India Do not raise the dust at your feet to touch your crown That has already happened, Anarkali I can see that you shall inherit Akbar the Great's India For God's sake... please The destiny of the people of India shall be within a lock of your hair, Anarkali And wherever you glance... thousands will tremble and the future will shake Attention - The Emperor cometh ??? His Majesty! Prince, you must not be so bold before the Emperor. Let me go The Emperor cometh If the Emperor sees me here, my grave will be dug before your eyes Love that fears is not love, it is lust and sin Out of the way! - No! Where is he? Who? Emperor Akbar, at whose command God-given breath is chocked Speak respectfully Salim's Anarkali shall not die in a despot's dungeon. I want his seal on this order to free her - Anarkali may not be set free - Why not? Silence! A Crown Prince must not forget his duty What duty demands the stifling of love in one's heart? Your duty is to obey the Emperor This is no duty! But it surely is punishment, being born in an Emperor's palace A punishment that you will have to suffer Then let Anarkali share my punishment with me You have no right to interfere But I have a right to my own life If Anarkali is not freed this night from prison, it won't agur well for the plans and dreams of Emperor Akbar. # "Let me lament the false story of love" # "I suffered countless hurts" # "Let me lament my youth" # "I lost all my senses" # "Your longing has reduced me to this" # "Let me lament the generosity of your love" # "Who knew I had to keep silent?" # "I had to live and conceal my love" # "I live, but I lament my life" Anarkali is to be presented in the Great Hall Surely the darkness of the dungeons has dimmed the glare of your magnificent longings? The dungeon's darkness was not dark enough to dispel the light I carry in my heart You may suffer even worse darknesses My longings shall become all the brighter Those longings shall be crushed And the Emperor's justice? I wish to hear no more! Akbar's command is the law! You will have to forget Salim Forget? - Certainly Further, you will convince him that you never loved him I could not bring my tongue to speak of my love to him. How can I refute? You shall impress on Salim that your love was false A slave longed to be Queen of India... and used the wiles of love God is my witness that it is not true But you shall have to prove that it's true Lord, give me the courage... to betray the Prince Your slave shall try to obey the Emperor's command You will not try, you will obey! Set her free. # I wish I was never in love with you # I wish our saga was never a spent reality # I wish I was never in love with you # I wish I'd never given you my heart # I wish I'd never be so helpless # I wish this world never existed, I wish these norms were never written # I wish such a test had never been # I wish I'd never been in love with you # For all my transgressions in love... # the world's wrath made me realise # Above Death's blow now I've risen # I wish I'd never been in love with you # Had you crushed my heart... # you would have done love a favour # And I'd never have had no grouse against the world # I wish I'd never been in love with you # I wish our saga was never a spent reality # I wish I'd never been in love with you No one has ever known Emperor Akbar to renege on his verdict Anarkali's acquittal is a defeat for the Emperor Not a defeat. It's proof that at heart, The Emperor is humane For the first time, I think of myself not merely as the Crown Prince, but also as the son of a father who is humane By freeing Anarkali, he has showered favours on love Not on love but on someone's betrayal Whose? Ask these chains I am asking you Your Anarkali's fragile wrists could not bear the weight of dungeon chains In exchange, she took golden bracelets from the Emperor Prove it Anarkali's reward: A gift of land... and tonight she will dance in the Newroz (New Year) celebrations, after which she has agreed to disappear forever. The Prince is coming Leave us You stay here Finally the fiery eyes of Akbar the Great have melted the wax of which you were made, and burned to ashes the tinsel ornament of love, with which you strutted before me... Ankarkali! Who was broken in the darkness of the dungeon by just one night You are not my Anarkali, you have stolen her name and fled from prison You are not my Anarkali Prince, I am not your Anarkali Cowardly whore of Akbar, you are not Salim's beloved You were just a false illusion that I believed in An ignominious blot on my name that has to be cleansed Attention all ye Behold the Empress of the World, the jewel on the throne of India, Maharani Jodhabai Behold the heir to the throne, His Highness the Crown Prince Noor-ud-Din Mohammed Salim Attention! Heed the Badshah, Plenipotentiary of Allah, the Emperor of Emperors, Jal Al-u-Din Mohammed Akbar, the One of whom the world seeks succour. # "One loves but once in this world" # "One lives and dies with that anguish" # "When one has loved, why should one be afraid?" # "I was only in love, I was not a thief" # "I shall tell the story of my love..." # "even if it costs me my life" # "Death is real when witnessed by the world" # "Why die of suppressed desire?" # "His longing dwells in my heart..." # "the flame of love lives there" # "As I live in love, so I shall die in love" # "There is nothing else left to do" # "Our love cannot be concealed, it is there for all to see" # "When nothing is veiled from God..." # "why wear a veil before his servants?" This fearless love of yours, this dance... this novel manner of expression - deserve our reward I am fortunate. I expected as much from the magnanimous plenipotentiary of Allah. Master Jailer! Take this insolent woman and confine her to the darkest dungeon. Leave us alone. Your continued presence is the proof of your disobedience Anarkali was taken to the dungeon and I did nothing What elso could you have done? What can one do before so a mighty an emperor? But today, Allah's Plenipotentiary must decide the limits of his tyranny and my patience If your yearning is for a slave, a servant... then your life-long patience won't be enough. Did God grant your prayer to beget a son so that you may mercilessly rule over him? Are you the master of even my heartbeats? Is my life a debt to your prayer, to be repaid by my tears? Anarkali is not worthy of you Why not? Hold me to your bosom as a loving father... Look at me with the affection of your first look at me... think of me as not as the Crown Prince, but as your son, then tell me that Anarkali is unfit for me I am an affectionate father of a beloved son... but I cannot overlook an Emperor's duty I cannot change the destiny of India for my son's love Destinies change. Times change A nation's history changes, emperors change Amidst all this, he who has submitted to love remains unchanged You will have to change Salim, you will have to change A father who had the ambition to see his son win many crowns An Emperor who thought his heir would bring great kingdoms into submission Father and Emperor have seen son and heir bow to a common slave The Emperor's lofty hopes have been dashed, the throne has been shaken Desist till he has regained his composure I should desist whose life has been ruined? Not him who fancies his empire has been marred? - That is not the case ... - Your Emperor rules as a god Does love also need the Emperor's permission? Who cares about permissions to fall in love? Prince, save my daughter! She will dash her head against the prison walls If she dies, India will become one vast burial ground... for the corpse of the Mughal Empire If the dungeon gates are not opened, then the walls of the dungeon will have to fall The heavy gates of the dungeon are not opened with swords, but with a key Bahaar I have dared Let us go away Where to? - Far away from Akbar's kingdom Arrest the insolent Salim Salim, you dare confront the Emperor for the sake of a slave girl? No, for a woman who in my reign will be the honour of the haughty Mughals The honour of the Mughals may never be equalled to a mere slave girl And our India is not your heart, to be ruled by a slave-girl And my heart is not your India, for you to rule We have no claim over your heart, but we have a claim over you You are our son Yes, I am your son But in making me suffer... have you forgotten that I am a part of your body too? No, Salim, no! You are the blossom of our countless prayers, the only asset of our life But do not stir a mother's love in order to tamper with royal customs Do not drag us beyond duty with the chains of your love Remember our responsibilities and your status Do not allow disrepute to eclipse your greatness Forget Anarkali For the sake of my milk that nourished you You ask me to pay the price for your milk No, Salim! No! Or would you rather that I bathe your feet in your milk that runs in my veins as blood? But ask not for interest on it. Son, what you are saying, you do not understand I understand fully. Keep your precious India, give me Anarkali, I beg of you I beg charity from Queen Jodha and from the Kingdom of Emperor Akbar Salim, these tears are the life-blood of Queen Jodha and the Emperor... Spill not tears from your eyes. Hold your tears Anarkali shall be given to you Never! Infamy shall not be forgiven to the descendant of Emperor Babar We command that Salim be dispatched to fight in the Deccan campaign A sword is held by a soldier, not a disappointed lover Do not expose the Prince's life to danger Death in battle is better... than a life spent pining for a slave girl Wait! Our Salim shall not go on this expedition My command needs no endorsement by a mother's blind love But it needs Salim's endorsement Queen If you wish to see how an emperor's command is rejected, try to command Salim Such scant regards has he for me? Do not judge Salim's respect for you in his present state Let the storm pass, then see what he can become And how shall this storm pass? Give him Anarkali; by doing so, he will return to us. To regain our own son, are we to be indebted to a slave girl? What is not done for a child's sake? You are merely a mother And you are merely an Emperor Indeed! Mansingh, let my command be obeyed By Imperial Command, our son... the heir and future Emperor, Noor ud din Mohammad Salim, shall tomorrow at the break of dawn... proceed to Deccan at the head of the army Enough! I am not Akbar's heir Prince! Wait for me at the gate Prince, was that no foolhardy? - If he only issues commands... I shall react with insolence and disobedience I won't allow you to act in naivet?. This is no time for obstinacy and anger The Emperor is being obstinate. He knows my wounds need balm, not a sword His might will not impress me The Emperor's dignity will not suffer the insult Your stubbornness will be the pretext for Anarkali's death He cannot do that! - He will If you want Anarkali's life, it stands beyond the battlefield Go and fight in Deccan If Anarkali's life is a reward of war... I shall change the course of war and twist the hands of death But who will be responsible for Anarkali's safety? I. She shall have the protection of my sword Your sword is but one against Akbar's millions I am a Rajput. Millions will sacrifice themselves for my word Your Majesty, the sculptor is here Leave us alone. Sculptor, we are glad to know that artists of your prowess thrive in our empire The truth is, I face starvation No longer We admire the beauty of your art. We shall honour and reward you In appreciation of art, this is too much. But in appreciation of truth, this is far too little. Then what do you want? To spread the truth of my art to every corner of the empire We grant permission Your Majesty's generosity will enable me to complete my unfinished projects There will be even more. Your life lacks a certain happiness As reward, we shall give you a flourishing beauty who once was your model Meaning? Tomorrow you shall marry Anarkali But, Your Majesty Is the reward insufficient? More than I dared hope Today I am convinced of His Majesty's justice You may go How fine is the difference between an Emperor's justice and tyranny After such a beautiful reward, is this how you express your happiness? Happy? Only fools give expression to happiness I'm only mocking the foolishness of the gift. You reject the Imperial Command and the precious reward? Certainly Are you aware of the consequences, Sculptor? This very masterpiece may come to life with my own blood By rejecting Akbar's command... you have shown courage and devotion to truth I am most grateful The Prince's gratitude is no fitting reward for my spirit Then what do you want? I want to see Anarkali's destiny securely joined with yours A message to the Emperor from the Crown Prince Let it be read aloud To the Emperor of India, Jal Al-u-Din Mohammed Akbar Let it be known that the heir to the throne, Noor-u-Din Mohammed Salim... through this message... declares his independence of you. I demand that the Emperor accept Anarkali as my wife... and the future Empress of India He should accept that I am a proud Prince of Timuride lineage... whose kings, regardless of custom or religion, chose their own queens Therefore, I am exercising my right to choose my own queen I am asserting that right If the Emperor does not accept my decision... This document of the vanity of youth is be read to the end I cannot bring myself to speak. The veil of courtesy is lifted today Read on! Read on! If the Emperor does not accept my decision... be it known that I'll start a rebellion. We accept the challenge of this upstart's rebellion. Tell the Chronicler to add the name of a love-crazed fool to the list of rebels Mansingh! we shall fight, and I shall lead the army myself Has the Queen forgotten that it is her duty to bless my sword? The Queen says she cannot present the sword that will slay the Prince Custom cannot be broken; we shall receive the sword from her hands I always received from your hands the sword that severed the heads of rebels. Today too, you shall perform that rite. You ask me to present you the sword that will kill my son, your Majesty? Not your son, but a rebel who has vowed to make you a widow Will you not present me the sword to protect myself, for my victory? There is no triumph for me. I shall lose, whatever happens My husband on one side, my son on the other Now you must make your choice: Your son or your husband? Queen of brave Rajput stock whose wives immolated themselves on the pyre of their husbands, why do you hesitate? Daughter of proud warriors, why do your hands tremble? How can these hands lift Akbar's sword, if they cannot even bear the bridal bracelets? Your Majesty! You have wiped the bridal symbol from my brow and you will return it to me with Salim's blood? If the price of my bridal loyalty is Salim's blood, take the sword and slay my child! I shall not even sigh The first beat of the war-drum shall herald her death Whose death, Your Majesty? Hers, whose charms have so darkened his soul that Salim can no longer recognize us. That darkness must be dispelled. That pretty serpent who writhes between Salim and me, must be fanged. # "Lord help me, I'm unfortunate" # "I am in dire straits..." # "my ship is in troubled waters" # "Lord help me, I'm unfortunate" # "Help me, Lord" # "Restore what I have lost" # "You know..." # "even my secret thoughts" # "My hands are tied..." # "and my heart is wounded" # "Have mercy, Lord" # "Misery clouds me, my Protector" # "Lord, save my ship..." # "it is drowning" # "There is a sign of a storm..." # "which makes life even more difficult" # "Have mercy, Lord" Open the prison gate, I have come to take Anarkali Except to death, to none else may we deliver her. The Emperor's orders. And I have orders to take her out alive. A Rajput has given his word The army is ready and awaits His Majesty - May Allah lead you to victory - May the Emperor who loves His subjects, His Motherland and God, be victorious always. O Emperor of Emperors Thou hast bestowed upon this humble man every blessing that life has to offer. I have been called Protector of the World, and Shadow of God Now please let me hear a voice that calls me father Akbar, are these the same hands which you lifted in prayer? Mansingh, before the battle I shall go and meet Salim It is not advisable for the Emperor to enter the rebel's camp alone But it is right for a father The Emperor Akbar cometh Leave us alone. Has His Majesty come to pardon the rebel? An unfortunate father, whom the world calls Emperor... has come to conciliate with his offended son and seek his love You destroy your son's love, and yet you seek his love Now the Emperor poses as a father? Emperors never weep These are the tears of a father. Your poor father is rendered helpless by the principles of Emperor Akbar And Salim is rendered helpless by his love Son, love can win hearts, but not battles Your emotions cannot withstand the onslaught of an omnipotent Emperor The battlefield shall decide An Emperor does not need a battle to come to a decision. The first beat of the war-drum shall herald Anarkali's death My son! Did we beseech Allah for a son only to show us this day? If the son can fulfil his obduracy only by slaying the father, then... here stands the father. Prince! Has an Emperor's might overcome a Rajput's word? No, Prince. A Rajput may give up his life... but never his promise. Where is Anarkali? Salim is victorious without war. There shall be no war There shall be war! We pray that on the battlefield God may protect you... from Akbar's wrath. Anarkali That you still live, bodes ill for Salim. Before the long shadow of Akbar's sword casts the shadow of death upon your heads... before the strom of blood and ashes wipes you out without trace... I demand the return of Anarkali This sword has destroyed the conceit of many warriors Today, it shall not only protect Anarkali, but also all lovers... whose heartbeats refuse to be enslaved by an emperor. Mansingh! Attack! Charge! Kill the abominable Anarkali on this very field. Anarkali is in danger. Permit me to take her to a safe place The Emperor has returned victorious from the field of battle Is this bridal sign Salim's blood? Behold this sword, not a drop of Salim's blood is on it You must be the only sword in the world to be embraced by a mother I want to see Salim You cannot Why? A father's sword was merciful... but an Emperor's justice will be done The accused, Noor-u-Din Mohammed Salim... son of Jal Al-u-Din Mohammed Akbar... is presented before this Court Attention all ye The proceedings may begin Noor-u-Din Mohammed Salim, you are accused... of dishonouring the Crown for the sake of a slave-girl You scorned Imperial commands You incited a mutiny, you compelled Durjan Singh to commit treason by forcefully freeing Anarkali You led the Imperial Army into revolt ... These accusations can be withdrawn... and your foolish disobedience forgiven... and all your former privileges restored, provided you return Anarkali So that you can put her to death? Certainly Then the Emperor should also punish unruly moths which fall in love with the flame Imprison the bumble bee that hums sweet melodies of love to the flower Dam the stream that would be one with the ocean I do not care to hear demented pleas for love I want Anarkali And I won't deliver her. Then I swear by the blood of Timur that runs in my veins... that you shall be disowned, and abandon your claim to this glorious throne Agreed. I won't accept a throne which is built upon Anarkali's grave I won't accept a crown which impales my heart This is unacceptable! You wish to melt down the gold of the Mughal crown in the fires of your love... to make anklets for a dancer You want to see a pretty whore dance on the sacred throne of India And you want to debase your future daughter-in-law before the court! Be silent The Emperor may try as much as he will, under the pretext of justice he won't get Anarkali. He may have his son's life instead. Justice I hold dearer than our son Noor-u-Din Mohammed Salim... you have taken advantage of our magnanimity You refuse to produce Anarkali in court Anarkali's sentence of death won't be revoked But in her place... we pronounce it on you Mercy, Your Majesty! Seek not my sympathy today! What more than death can be expected of a despot Emperor? When the Chronicler writes in Salim's blood of his and Anarkali's death... he will also record the death of the Emperor Akbar. Leave me! - What news? - Akbar the Great has commanded... the Prince's execution tomorrow in place of Anarkali As long as Durjan's hands can grasp a sword... death shall not come near the Prince Where are you going? - To face the Emperor Akbar. But you are wounded! - My body is wounded... but not my courage! Out of my way! Mata ... Do you see fear on your son's face? No. I have faith in my blood I have come to congratulate my son The brave Rajput was also wedded to death May every mother possess a heart such as Maharani Jodha This historic day... marks the defeat of Akbar the Great and the triumph of love I am grateful to you I congratulate the mothers of those martyrs... who sacrificed their lives for truth and love My last request... is that you stand by those who have a heart, not those who have the power Long live the Prince! # "The lover celebrates..." # "along the path of love" # "Be Joyous..." # "Love attains martyrdom" # "Long Live Love!" # "You remain free of wealth's fetters" # "You are in the temple, the mosque of every creed" # "You are in Krishna's flute and the Muezzin's call" # "Thanks to you, faith is alive in the world" # "Walls of hate cannot keep out love's storm" # "Love cannot be killed by blades and swords" # "Lovers may die, but their memory lives on" # "Love's revolt can change the world" # "Set the citadels ablaze, reject the throne" # "Do not stand before death as a mendicant" # "He whose religion is royal splendour is a man without creed" # "He whose heart is devoid of love is formed of stone, not flesh" # "Enemy of love, regain your senses, or you shall perish" # "Long Live Love" Long live Mansingh! Mansingh! Should Your Majesty so desire, the Prince may now be released. After Anarkali's death He is alive. He lives. Your Majesty My felicitations to His Majesty that the Prince is alive. And to you, that you'll die. Take away this bewitching enchantress. And bury her alive. May the sun of the Emperor's glory shine for ever... and may my Prince outlive the moon and the stars Accept my life, that is all I wish for, I have been richly rewarded. Anarkali, it is the custom to grant the condemned a last wish If you have one, ask His Majesty My last wish is not within his Majesty's power Our mercy is not so limited that it cannot grant a slave's last wish Speak Before her death, this slave wishes to become the empress At last! What lurked in your heart has come to your lips Even in the terrible night before your doom... you still dream of being the queen of India Do not misunderstand my wish The Prince had promised... to make me his Queen I do not want him to break his promise. I do not want the future Emperor of India... to blush for not keeping his promise to a slave That shame shall not befall the future Emperor of India Mansingh, release Salim Before dawn, make Salim inhale this flower's perfume, drenched with the potion of oblivion Thus he will forget you and remain oblivious of your death Guards will take you from your lover's arms... and place you in the arms of death Death draws nearer than love It shall be done If not, Salim will not let you die... and I shall not let you live I died long ago Now please allow the coffin to be carried away You may go In return for this magnanimity, this slave absolves you, Jal Al-u-Din Mohammed Akbar, for murdering her # "How can hearts pine less?" # "How can love diminish?" # "When the night is so drunken..." # "what shall dawn be like?" # "The melodies are intoxicating..." # "goblets brim with joy" # "The joy that reigns here..." # "is the legend of tomorrow # "How could the season of love be more beautiful? # "Both lover and beloved are together" # "Alluring eyes, love pining within the heart" # "Within this splendour..." # "why should she give a thought to death?" # "Strange is the state of lovers" # "What can be said of the end of love?" # "If ankle-bells break, then what shall happen, my companion?" How could you do this to me? Have these beautiful hands said farewell to love? Can they betray me? Do not turn your face away from Salim. Come close and tell me; can you abandon me? Never. Anarkali can abandon her life... but not you Abandon your life? Who wants to deprive you of your life? No one Was I intoxicated only so that they can take you away me? Fate willed it so Fate must change its verdict Anarkali, the crawling shadows are closing in The cowardly slaves of Emperor Akbar are coming to take you away I can see them Come out! Anarkali is mine, no one can take her away from me These unclean slaves... cannot touch your chaste body Beloved, come to me You insolent knaves! Anarkali, Salim loves you. # "From the half-light of dawn..." # "comes the call of death" # "It sounds as if someone has stilled the song of life" # "May God always protect you" # "Accept this message of a true heart" # "I leave this world of yours behind" # "Arise, accept my farewell" # "Tomorrow, when my funeral procession passes by..." # "promise that you will not bear my coffin on your shoulder" # "Let not our love suffer disgrace" # "Accept this message of my tears" My child, my daughter I swear by these sacred scales of justice... that whatever you may request of me shall be granted Your Majesty! Where is His Majesty? Disrespectful woman, what do you want? My daughter's life Perhaps you are too shocked to comprehend our justice Remember this token, Your Majesty You promised me whatever I might ask I ask for the life of Anarkali I remember nothing A just king never goes back on his word I said I remember nothing You can forget your promise... but the Emperor of Emperors, who made you Emperor, will never forget On Judgement Day... I shall seek justice before Him Take her away My daughter, Your Majesty! Ask what you wish What can a king who has broken his word, give? Look! Look! Anarkali, my child! I am grateful, Your Majesty Listen, this tunnel will lead you to the border of the Mughal empire The secret that Anarkali is alive... you shall not reveal. All his life Salim will believe that Anarkali is dead So be it. By letting her live, the Emperor has kept his justice alive Anarkali, make obeisance As long as the world survives, Anarkali... you shall remain the eternal symbol of love Mughal history shall remember you for ever... because you gave new life to the descendants of Babar and Humayun But I... I can give you nothing but a life of obscurity I am helpless I swear by God, I am not an enemy of love, but a slave of principles Consider the helplessness of a slave... then, perhaps, you can forgive me Anarkali, His Majesty is addressing you Take her And that is how my beloved Emperor Jalal ud din Mohammad Akbar spared Anarkali's life In the eyes of the world he appeared cruel and unjust I am the living testimony of that Emperor's justice He whom the world remembers as The Great Mughal The END Engl. subtitles corrections: serdar202 - 2017
