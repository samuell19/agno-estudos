Even in darkness there can be a light. You're of the same flesh. Your blood is my blood. Your eyes as a child. What mirrors to parts of my soul I had yet to discover. - Sorry, dear. It's good to see you, dear. I was glad you could help me this week. I used to have a friend who would kinda take care of the place when I was off. But, she recently moved away and I figured I'd reach out. Glad you responded. - Of course, I don't mind helping you. - I wish I could explain myself to your mother. Your grandfather was my best friend. During the war we made a pact. A promise in blood. That if he died I would take care of her. We didn't expect the love to come. I loved your mother like she was my own. But she, now she lost her father. She always resented me. When she left at 17, I, it hurt, my heart, deeply. And it hurt your grandmother. She went into severe depression. - Don't you think that you could have helped? You could have left? - Your grandfather, Ellis, was a good man. We were brothers in arms. He made me promise, Alma. A promise to a brother in war. Is a bond. That can't be broken. No matter what. I supported your grandmother. I loved your mother, I love you. You, I mean I always regarded you as my own. I need for you to know, how much I thought about you over the years, Alma. Seeing you now is surreal. The beautiful thing, is like having your grandmother back again. You know, I sometimes feel her spirit. War can take away your religion. But, it couldn't take away the feeling of her presence. Well, I suppose history is written by the victor. Being the last one standing, doesn't mean you've won. I have this early memory of her. In this beautiful gown, walking gracefully through the house. I wish I could've spent more time with grandmother. I mean, I am her namesake after all. Yes, she passed young. Which makes all memories of her at her best. She was an amazing person. And someone who tried to be the best mother she could. It killed me to think I was a wedge between her and your mother. But, I had to take care of her. Maybe one day I will, I will understand. I hope so dear. I would love to have a relationship with you. - No, maybe something that not everybody knows, but it's still like huge and like, you know. I mean, like here and huge. - Like a grand name. - Like a grand name like, help, help. I don't know - I'm still stuck with Salvatore. - Not Salvatore. Salvatore, come eat now! - It'd be pretty Italian. But I would always just picture him as a little Italian man. He wouldn't be like a son, you know. - What if it's a girl? Can Salvatoras? - We're not having girls, we're having boys. - We're not having. - They're gonna be bad as shit. - What if I have both? - Then she'll be bad as shit. And her name will be, Charlie. - Anastasia. - Anastasia. - Anastasia. - Anastasia. - Shut up. - Yeah? - Hi, I'm here to speak to you about Jesus Christ. I'm sorry. - Our Lord and Savior. I'm not interested. - I'm here to save you. - No, I'm not interested, I'm sorry. - But, what about your grandma? Hi. She seems interested. Just a few minutes. You have to leave. What'd ya find? - I dunno, this one. I think I'm feeling. - Oh yeah, I've been there, I don't wanna go there. No, okay choice number - I'm sorry I just was there. - Choice number two, wait what's coming? Not worry about, oh, I think it's, not the this. Yes, say yes. I don't wanna look anymore. - Alright fine, we could go here. - It doesn't matter. - Oh, I think a gig is going on here tonight. Somebody's playing. - Cool. - Alright, fuck it, let's do it. - Yeah. - Oh yeah, we'll start here. And then we'll head toward. - Yeah, we can shemp it. Let me see where it plays. - No, yeah, let's jump around. - Come on, Henry what's that? We don't need that tonight, let's come on. Still have fun. - Yeah, I went I have a couple left and I was like fuck it I'll just, do you want one? - No. - We're having a chill night. - No, I don't want one. You just promised not today. - Alright. - Alright. - It's really not, fuck. - It is, we talked about it. Explained it to you so many times it is a big deal. - It's not a big deal, babe. They're really, it's one, it's one. It's one pill. - It. - It's not gonna be. - No, you do realize this problem? - Look do you realize that there is no problem? Except your, you know, bringing it up. I'm sorry, I'm sorry baby, listen. It's not a big deal, it's one pill. We're gonna go out. - No, don't baby me, come on, we talked about it. - What? - Nothin'. Huh? What? Can't understand you. I don't speak Romanian. I'm fucking with you. Listen, I don't know what you're getting so bent out of shape for? It's okay, alright. We're gonna go to that. - Yeah, let's go. - Don't be weird tonight. Look, I'm sorry okay, no more. Alright, no more. Look, this didn't, that's it. - Okay. - Alright? - Ah, I can't even. - What? - It's hard to be upset with you. - Go ahead. - Shut up. - Punch me, go ahead. There you go. - Hey. Yeah, do you mind coming over? Yeah, now. It's nothing. I don't know I just got freaked out. Yeah, I'll text you. I'll text you the address. Okay. - The house is clear. Nothin' under the bed. I didn't find anything is what I'm saying. - Yeah I. - But I, look I want you to know that, I mean I wanna, you know, I wanna help out. Anyway I can or whatever, but I just, I don't think that, you should. - Listen I, we were out last night and I was, yeah I'm tired and then I don't know it's a new house. So I didn't, I don't know. I just. - No, no, yeah. You know, I'm glad that I was able to, you know, check the place out and you know. - No, yeah, and I thank you. Like really, thank you. - But like, I'm not gonna, you know, come up here all. - No, I know, I just saw your number and I called, and I know I shouldn't and, but thanks for coming and for checking out. - Yeah, yeah, I gotta actually, gotta run. Got something to take care of. - Yeah, go, go, yeah, thanks. They say history is written by the victors. But are you one of the victors? I've faced with the servant of my suffering. Loss, love, are often two faces of the same coin. Wait here, Alma. Don't forget your grandfather. 'Cause I've not forgotten him. His name was Ellis. He was gentle. As summers golden hours. His hands strong as firewood. Words kind and thoughtful. He sobbed joyfully the day Susan was born. I never loved him more. Susan was so little, so sweet. She wore her father's eyes. Held in duration. Ellis tried his best to win her favor. But like a dog his love was feared for a good reason. Never trusted even his shadow. She never slept soundly when they shared a room. She never felt at home and they resented each other for it. Forever to be a house divided. - Thanks. You're welcome. So, why are you here? - Yeah sorry, so I had this dream, and I woke up in these woods. And this place I, I didn't know it, I've never been there. I'm on this path. And I'm sort of compelled to move toward the end. And I look and I see there's this woman there. I keep walking forward, forward. And it's like, it's you. So I keep getting closer and closer. I go to touch her shoulder. And you start to turn your head. And just before I can tell if it's you or not. I fuckin' wake up. I still had that feeling. Inside me. And I don't know, I just felt like I needed to come here and I needed to tell you that. - I don't know what to say. - Oh shit. So you didn't. You didn't. - Listen, let's not talk about this. Let's not make it. - I don't see you for a while. And then you call me out of the blue, and we have a great night and then, you still wanna talk about it and then you're just gonna go house sit and like what, I'm just supposed to accept it? - Listen, last night doesn't mean that we're a thing again. It didn't mean that. I don't know what I'm doing, I don't know. But it didn't mean what you think for sure. - Didn't you have a fucking good time last night? - I did have a fucking good time last night. I did. - So? I wanna see you again. I wanna keep this going. - This is not that. This wasn't that, it's not. - What was it? - I don't. I don't know what it was, but it's not what you think. Can we just? - Look, we can't do this. We can't just have a one night fuck and that's it. That's not us. You know that. - There's no us. Us is like over. I don't know what last night was. I dunno, maybe it was a mistake, I don't know okay. This is fuckin' ridiculous, dude. - I'm not having a fight now, I need to be there in like an hour. Do you want some soup, Gus? - What? Who's Gus? - Soup Henry, do you want some soup? Just made it, it's ready. - Uh, yeah sure. - You wanna try it? - No. What? - Nothin'. - You're acting really bizarre, today. - Am I? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - I'm acting really bizarre. - Huh, gonna cut the soup with that knife, or something? How's the, how's the cut? - The cut, the cut is good. I don't know what the hell I did, I wasn't paying attention. So clumsy. Yeah, it's good. - Hey, can I ask you something? - Yeah. - Well, I mean, past couple days. Just spending a little more time together. - Yeah? - I just was wondering where you thought, you know, where you thought we were? 'Cause I, I really, I really like where we were going. You know? And I think that this is good, and that we can kind of give this, you know, a shot. Again. Alma? Hey. Sorry. - I told you just because I let you in my room, we don't have to do this. This was not the deal. - What no, I mean. - The deal was not to love you. It was just to accept you. - What? What the fuck does that mean? We've done this before. We've grown, I think we're much, we can do this now. - Don't touch me. - Jesus, um, sorry. Do you want some water or something? - No, I'm good. I'm good Gus, I'm good. Just choking. - Alright, who's uh? Who the fuck is Gus? - Henry, what the hell? - Aw fuck you, dude. Oh, are you serious? - What's wrong with you? - Oh shit. - Fuck me, from what? - What, you start fucking somebody else - I told you. - And then you come and fuckin' call me back? What the fuck is that? - No, Henry, what the hell? I call you, what, what? - Who the fuck is Gus? Shit, look I just wanted to know where we stood okay. That's it. I don't wanna keep coming back in and out of your life like this. I can't handle it myself, I can't do that. - I hate you Gus, I hate you. - What the fuck are you doing? Stop fucking hitting me. - Get out of my bedroom. Told you you're not allowed in my bedroom. - Okay, you know what maybe you're right. This is fucking insane. I don't know what you're talking about. I don't know who the fuck Gus is. If you're just, if you wanna be with me then tell me that, and if not then just fucking end it. I don't wanna do this anymore. Hey, I'm sorry okay. I just, I get a little frustrated sometimes, that's all. - I really can't breathe. - What, you really can't breathe? - I can't breathe. - Okay, okay, okay, okay. - Can you take this off, I don't know. - Okay, hold on, alright? Let me grab your necklace, we'll take that off. - Yeah, take the necklace off. Take it off, take it off. - Well, you need to just relax for a second, okay? Let me just, just breathe easy, easy, easy, easy, alright? - You know, you're just not him. You're not him, you're alright but you're not him. Why are you not him? - Who? - Why are you not him? - Who the fuck are you talking about? - I don't want you. - Stop, baby, stop, stop. - I just can not be with him, where is he? Tell me how he died. - Who died? What are you talking about? - You killed him. You told me you killed him. He told me. He told me you killed him. I don't know. I don't know. - Can you come back to the, you wanna lay down on the bed? It's probably more comfortable than the corner. - I really loved him. I'm not a bad person, I'm not, I'm not. I, I know. You're gonna have to. - I know what you did. I know you killed him. Alma, look at me. - You killed him, I know that you killed him. Who, who are you talking about? I didn't. - That was to be your plan all along, huh? What? - Just like ruin my life. Go get me water. Get me water right now. - Alright. - I told, don't touch me, get me water. - Jesus fuckin' Christ. Just lay down and I'll come back. - And bring me wine. I want wine. Can I even fucking be awake with you? Bring me wine! - I don't know what's going on, but. Hey. Hey. - I don't know. - I just want, what? - There's nothing between us, Gus. We didn't do this, right? It's not our fault, right? Who are you talking about? - You love me right? You're not gonna leave me, right? - No. - No. - I don't want that, I want to be in your life. I want this to work again. You know that. - So, it's my fault, right? What? - It's my fault. Okay, stop doing that. - I think we deserve each other. We totally deserve each other. You know, he was good, he was good with everything. Could be a good dad. And he was a good lover, not like you. You're horrible, you're horrible. You're half of the man he was. I'm a bit confused right now. Gus used to mutter in his sleep. He'd laugh, it unsettled me. In later years he would drink himself into a rage, and whisper of the war. A battle between he and Ellis. I always knew the truth. Gus was a god damn liar. Gus may be the monster in the outskirts of our lives. We were the ones where hell is ring up. Perhaps he was the final battle. Perhaps he was just coming fired by her own blood. I know now he was a wolf. Alma, Alma. Dear Grandmother named Alma. You must do what I wasn't able to do. You must reach in the gardens and cut the head off the snake in the grass. Do not trust Gus. Do not trust the slightest of moves. His breath is amongst the silent beating weeds. The cracks of our lives breaking his weight or head. Breaking anything. The man loves to drink his darkness dry. Poison his wine. Do what I could not. Gus shall pay for his sins. We all pay for our sins. Even the snakes will someday come to face the burning sun. His day of judgment is near. You are the strongest of my grandchildren. But the burden of strength is only carried by those with the torch bright enough to see through the darkness of the forest and know you are the heir. Take your throne. Pray for us. His days are numbered. Call his number. Make him pay for his sins. ♫ Baby you're as nice as morning rain ♫ I keep thinking of seeing no clouds today ♫ I've been searchin' for you everywhere ♫ But baby you've been showin' up nowhere ♫ And I know ♫ I'll still try ♫ And I know ♫ I'll still try and maybe it's just that we've grown apart ♫ But baby you still hold the key to my heart ♫ Just know that it's always been this way ♫ And I won't ever rest until I see you one day ♫ And I know ♫ I'll still try ♫ I know ♫ I'll still try Fuck.

He was with me, he'll always be with me. He was with me, he'll always be with me. Your eyes as a child are mirrors to parts of my soul I had yet to discover. Alma, I'm your grandmother. We are connected by the string of ancient heritage of women. The thread is long. And the path is rough. But at the failing sun of life's saddest hours, which for I forever glow. Dear Alma. They say history is written by the victors. I'd argue that it's the victors, those that survive war, are faced with insurmountable suffering. Loss and love are often two faces of the same coin. My dear Alma, don't forget your grandfather. As I've not forgotten him. His name was Ellis. He was gentle as summer's golden hours. His hands strong as firewood. Words kind and thoughtful. He sobbed joyfully on the day Susan was born. I never loved him more. Alma, is everything alright? You, you seem strange. You feeling sick? - No, I'm just hungry. Wine? - Please. I'm worried about you dear. How was your stay here? Everything seems good. - Yes, I kept things tidy for you. I appreciate that very much. - A toast. A toast to love and to life. To all the ones we have lost. To my dear grandmother, to my dear Ellis, and to my dear daughter Susan. - Sweetie. Susan is your mother. And you should call Ellis grandfather out of respect. - You're right, I'm sorry. I didn't sleep well last night. Nightmares. - Make sure you get some sleep tonight. You can nap here if you'd like. - Thank you. Are you hungry? Yes, a little bit. It might be a bit cold. I thought you'd be home earlier. - Well the flight was on time, but my taxi hit some traffic. You don't seem right. What's going on? - What's wrong with you? Are you feeling guilty? After all these years? Are you feeling guilty? After you killed him? Just to fuck me and to raise my daughter. And to isolate her from me. I know what you did. I know, he told me. Who? - Oh my dear Ellis, of course. Maybe you've had too much wine. - No, but I didn't have the wine. To love. And now, it's when you die. Same way you killed him. The same way you killed me. Exactly the same way. My dear Alma, make him pay for his sins. ♫ Baby you're as nice as morning rain ♫ I keep thinking of seeing no clouds today ♫ I've been searchin' for you everywhere ♫ But baby you've been showin' up nowhere ♫ And I know ♫ I'll still try ♫ And I know ♫ I'll still try ♫ And maybe it's just that we've grown apart ♫ But baby you still hold the key to my heart ♫ Just know that it's always been this way ♫ And I will never rest until I see you one day ♫ And I know ♫ I'll still try ♫ And I know ♫ I'll still try
