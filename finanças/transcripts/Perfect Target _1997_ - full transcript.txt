(tense music) (tense music) (men shout) (tense mariachi music) - You are lucky tonight, senor. Too lucky. - It's a curse I try to live with. (calm upbeat music) (David speaks a foreign language) - Please don't take this personally, senor. But you remind me of something I scraped off my shoe today. - No offense taken. A mix up happens all the time. Salut. - Problem is, senor, there is not a mix up. Shit is shit. If it sticks to a shoe or it walks into the wrong cantina. - Well, in that case, my bottle and I will be happy to leave. Adios. (crowd screams and shouts) (man grunts) (man screams) (knuckles crack) (David grunts) (man grunts) (man screams) (tense music) - Come on. (police blow whistle) - Hey, hey, hey, hey! He started it! Where the hell are you taking me? What are you doing? Let me go, come on! (man speaks a foreign language) - Yep. That's my boy. (cell door opens) (foot steps approach) David. David Benson. This is your wake up call. - Oxnard? (David groans) - You look like shit, David. You don't smell so good either. - Does that mean I won't get a hug? - No. But how does getting out of this toilet sound to you? - I'm pretty happy here. I've bonded with the jailer. The hours are great. - David, what do you say we go talk to a mutual friend of ours about a little gig? You walk out of here Scott free, all charges dropped. - Last time I worked for you guys, I was brought up for conspiracy and fraud. - And that was way above both of us David, and you know it. An hour of your time, you're out of here, whether you take the job or not. Is your schedule freeing up yet? (calm music) - Passport and paper please. (men speak a foreign language) - I think you're still bitter for being the fall guy. - I passed bitter two years ago. Now I'm pissed off. - The Iran Contra gate was bad business for everyone. - It doesn't seem to have hurt your standing in the community. - I'm not a boy scout like you, Benson. I'm flexible. I understand the system. - Tell me something, Oxnard. - What? - Does it hurt when you bend over that much? (man speaks a foreign language) - Gracias. You get used to it. (horse neighs) Dining facilities. Mission control. We're private enterprise these days, David. Guns for hire. Professional defenders of Pax Americana. - Save the commercial for someone else, Oxnard. So where's this mutual friend of ours? - [Shakwell] Right here, Benson. - Shakwell. It's been a long time. - Too long. Well, you look fit. Nice tan. Been keeping busy. - I suppose you could talk about my favorite color too, but why don't we do that after you tell me what you want? - Aw, Benson. Time has changed you. You've grown cynical and impatient. I like that. Santa Brava. A small but strategically significant little piece of real estate. The US government put the previous regime of the Santiago family into power. That was 50 years ago. When their patriarch, Emilio Santiago, finally died a couple of years ago, Uncle Sugar proposed a new deal in keeping with these enlightened times of ours. No more US aid unless Santa Brava agrees to stage a free and open election. The beneficiary of this mandate was Fernando Casillas, elected el presidente to Santa Brava nearly one year ago today. - His wife's the one that hired us, David. Against the wishes of her husband. - She's afraid that a reactionary element within the government will attempt to eliminate the president during his first anniversary speech, which is to be delivered a mere 72 hours from now. - Where do I fit in? - Casillas' greatest moment of vulnerability will be during the speech itself. He'll be in the middle of a plaza, completely exposed. Now the Santa Brava security people are competent, but they are not trained to cope with an outside professional. No, we need a specialist of our own in there. - We need you, David. - Come on, guys. This is pretty basic stuff. Why me? - [Shakwell] For one, you're available. - And we don't have time to conduct job interviews, Mr. Benson. - Mr David Benson, may I present senora Isabela Santiago Casillas, wife to president Casillas. - Senora presidenta. - Senora Casillas has taken a proactive part in overseeing the matter of her husband's security. She was most impressed with your qualifications. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - David, inside, you'll find a cashiers cheque for $10,000, paid in advance. US passport and visa papers included. Further, a congressional pardon for your unwitting involvement in that Iran business. - A second chance, David. - I am told you're the best, Mr. Benson. Please consider your decision carefully. If you will excuse me. - Correct me if I'm wrong, did senora presidenta's name have a Santiago somewhere in the middle? - Her father was old Emilio's brother. You know how it is in these banana republics. If there's not some thread connecting them to the old regime... - Casilla's name never would have made it onto the ballot. I got you. - But senor and senora Casillas are part of a new breed in this country. Educated at foreign universities, politically savvy, and genuinely concerned about the welfare of the people. The ghost of the Santiago clan is the least of Casillas' worries, with reactionary generals and guerrillas lurking in the jungle. - Guerrillas? - Rebels, revolutionarios, you know the type. Enemies of the rich. Friends of the peasants. Supposedly, there's been an armistice in effect since the election, a chance for Casillas to make good on his campaign promises. - And how long is that supposed to last? - Who knows? Bottom line, Casillas is a long tailed cat in a room full of rocking chairs. (Washington grunts) - Not bad for a girl. - Yeah, well it's my job to make you look good, Washington. - Gentlemen, fall in please. This is your team, David. I believe you will recognize at least one of these babies. - Oxnard, classy set up you got here. Look at this shit hole, man. This must be the place where all the flies come to die. - Come on, Mason. We've been in worse. - Yeah, Honduras, 88. - Bad days. - Fucked up is more like it, buddy. Heard they cut your nuts off and shoved them down your throat. - Sure could have used a breath mint. (all laugh) - Good to see you. - Good to see you, Mason. - Good to see you, buddy. - Sergeant Stiles, formerly 82nd Airborne. - Heard a lot about you, sir. - Good things? - Nothing but. - Good. - [Oxnard] Washington, Rexell. Former army ranger. - Pleasure to be aboard, sir. - [David] Good to have you. - Yeah. - Peoples, flew choppers, covert ops. You've probably been his passenger a couple of times. - I'm sure. - How you doing, man? (police siren sounds) - Oxnard, you order a pizza? - Yeah, with jalapenos. You'll love it. - Uh-oh, Oxnard. Should've paid that parking ticket. - Yeah. - One of you gentlemen is senor Oxnard? I am capitan Miguel Ramirez of the Santa Brava federal police. Reporting for duty, senoras. - The captain has been attached to our team. - What? - Senoras, in our country, it is generally understood that the federales, the federal police, are in charge of our own president's security. - Capitan, hold it right there. Can I expect any more fucking surprises? - The surprise was ours, senor. Not yours. I'm just here to make sure there is correlation between the different security details. Now is there a problem with that? - No problem. I'm sure we can find a way to work this out. Right David? - Gracias, senor. You are David Benson, no? (tense music) You have some problem working with a local, senor Benson? - Not really. - Maybe because you've been doing nothing more than chasing whores for the last five years, you think we're all putas down here. - Maybe it's because I've been down here too long. Don't take this personally, capitan, but I just don't trust anyone who's wearing a uniform. - And I have been here too long to trust anyone who's ever been in the CIA. Don't take it personal, amigo. - Hey David, come on. - So Mason, how'd you get roped into this one? - As usual, they hired me for my girlish good looks and my scintillating personality. (all laugh) - Shit man, last time I saw a face like yours, it had a fucking hook in it. - Look who's talking, I'm not exactly growing a third leg staring at yours. I'm an out of work grunt. Shakwell called, waving cash. There was nothing else on my dance card. How about you, Stiles? - Same shit, man. Just a different pile. - Speaking of shit boys. - El capitan. You getting your shit together over there? (all laugh) - As you were, men. David, if I'm not taking you away from anything terribly important, colonel would like a word. - Chopper drops us in Santa Brava City, 0600 tomorrow. Casillas' personal guards will pick us up at the helipad. - I'd really sleep better tonight if he just televised the speech. I don't like the plaza, it's too open. - Well, you're welcome to run it up the flag pole and see if he salutes. We're scheduled to have a security briefing with el presidente at 0900. And gentlemen, we have been asked to include el capitano. - In the interests of diplomacy, we don't have a choice. - He's a plant. They don't trust us. - Almost as much as we don't trust them. - No problem. We'll just keep the good captain's radio switched to another channel. - Wouldn't want it any other way, colonel. See you later. - Hasta luego. (Casillas speaks a foreign language) - Ah, senor presidente, I would like to introduce to you our team leader, David Benson. - Yes, Mr. Benson. My wife has already told me a lot about you. I'd like to thank you in advance for your most able assistance. - Uh, sir. I've been told you said no to a televised speech. In my opinion, it's a big mistake. - Mr. Benson, let me be very frank with you. I am told that you're being paid quite well for your services. If I were to cancel my plans now, then I would have no further need for you. Or your team of professional killers, now would I? - Fernando, Mr. Benson has made great sacrifices on behalf of his integrity and his ideals. He does not do this for money, but for a chance to regain his honor and return to his country. - Is that so? Then I have a question for you, Mr. Benson. Man of high ideals that you claim to be. Have you observed, I mean really observed, how the people of Santa Brava exist? - Yes, sir. I have. - Then you've seen the poverty. The misery. And yet observe how their presidente lives. Please tell me, Mr. Benson, I'm very anxious to know, how does a man of high ideals, such as yourself, reconcile such disparity? What would you do with such a palace as this? - You're asking the wrong guy, sir. Me, a room this big, I would turn it into a basketball court. (all laugh) - Yes, precisely, precisely, why not? And what else, Mr. Benson? A hospital ward, perhaps? Because you see, this presidential palace represents everything that was wrong with the previous regime. - Uh, Fernando, are we not losing track of the reason Mr. Benson is here? - Yes. Perhaps so. Perhaps so. You will forgive me, Mr. Benson, if sometimes I jump to conclusions too quickly. But remember the words we've spoken here today, because you'll hear them again tomorrow, at the plaza. - Sir, I still wish you'd reconsider. - The people must know that I am one of them, Mr. Benson. Don't you see? Doesn't anyone see? I refuse to appear as some untouchable televised phantom. - Sir, I like what you're saying, but it is my job to make sure that those convictions don't get you killed. - Duly noted, my friend. Duly noted. Keep me safe and sound. I place my trust in you. And in God. (suspenseful music) Gentlemen. (crowd cheers) - I want two minute checks to myself and major Oxnard. If a bird farts, I wanna know about it. Stiles, Washington, ground level, north south. Peoples, ocean side. Capitan Ramirez, I want you to be on the gazebo. Somehow Mason, you don't impress as a devout Catholic. - Are you kidding, man? Deep down, I'm as pure as the virgin. - Yeah, right. Check all three towers. The staircases leading up to them stay locked and bolted. - Check. - I don't care if the Pope himself wants up there. - You got it, buddy. - What the hell did I just tell you? - Why don't I go with him? There's three towers, two men can check it out faster. - Let's get something straight, capitan. If senora presidenta trusted you to run the show, she wouldn't be wasting her money on me, okay? So now, get with the program and don't push your luck. - No, you don't push. - When this is over, amigo, you and I are gonna have a serious discussion. And believe me, it's going to hurt. - I'm looking forward to it. I enjoy pain. You'll hear from me. Every two minutes. - Oxnard. - Yeah, roger that, top dog. We got you on visual. - Keep the visual on captain asshole, he's pushing all my wrong buttons. - You got him on a separate channel, right? - Roger that. - Then we're cool. Just let him do his thing, top dog. He's window dressing. - Got ya. - Watchdog, top dog. What's the hold up? - [Oxnard] Team in position, top dog. Show time. (triumphant music) (crowd cheers) - Friends. One year ago, you elected this administration based upon one single promise. That we would move this country forward. Now let me tell you that in that brief period of time, we have taken the first steps towards declaring a state of war. But a war against poverty. Against starvation. Against ignorance. And above all, against political corruption! (crowd cheers) - Sitrep, talk to me team. - South side clear. - Ocean clear, boss. - East side, A-okay. - Now I realize, I realize that such a war requires sacrifice, from each and every one of us. - Come on, Mason. Quit saying your rosaries and give me a sitrep. - Staring at the very top, with us. With your leaders. And specifically with me. - Mason. (tense music) Oxnard, I've got a problem. - Every morning, I look outside the walls of the presidential palace, and what do I see? - Oxnard. - What's the problem, top dog? - Silhouette, bell chamber at the clock tower. Can't get Mason on the horn. And where the hell is Oxnard? - Don't waste time, check it out yourself. I've got the plaza covered. - I'm moving. - What's up, boss? - Hold your positions, this might be a diversion. - I see poverty. I see sickness. I see disease. - Oxnard God damn it, where are you? - I see hunger. - Ramirez, are you near the cathedral? - [Casillas] I see children dying in their mother's arms. - Ramirez! - So today, my wife Isabela and I make the first in a series of personal sacrifices, and perhaps sacrifice is not the right word. We should simply call them duties. Our duties. Today, my friends, we return to the people of Santa Brava that which rightfully belongs to them! (crowd cheers) We shall turn what was once a symbol of greed and selfishness into a symbol of benevolence. Into a symbol of life. A magnificent palace built by the sweat, by the blood of the people, shall take its rightful place as a palace for the people. As a palace of health and well being for all the citizens of Santa Brava! (crowd cheers) My friends, this palace, this presidential palace, is not a gift. - No! (gun fires) (Casillas and Isabela scream) (crowd shouts) (guns fire) Son of a bitch! - I've spotted the assassins, they're in the clock tower of the cathedral. The assassins' names are David Benson and Captain Miguel Ramirez. They are armed and dangerous. (Shakwell speaks a foreign language) Do not hesitate to shoot. I repeat, shoot to kill. - It was a set up! Those lousy bastards! - Mason! (gun fires) - They're on the roof, fan out! Fan out! Move it! Now! - I'm telling you, my men are never gonna believe this bullshit! - Suit yourself, I'm out of here. - That's exactly what Oxnard wants us to do! Hola, amigos! Hola! (gun fires) Aye! - You were saying? Get ready to jump! (man screams) (man screams) The street behind the cathedral, let's go. (David screams) (Miguel screams) Mason, Peoples, it's a set up! - [Peoples] Say again, top dog? - Oxnard is fucking us. (gun fires) You son of a bitch! - Sorry, buddy! (Mason screams) - Come on! - Go! - Shit! Shit! What are you waiting for? Move! Go! Get every road out of the city closed! (man speaks a foreign language) Get the choppers in the air! I want them dead, you hear me? Dead! Shit! (Mason coughs) - Sorry, sir. I tried. - I know you did, serge. Just a final loose end. We'll tie it up. - Loose end, yes sir. We'll nail him. - We'll nail him. Get this loose end out of my sight. Move! - [Man] Si, senor! (car engine stalls) - Out of gas. - Oh, shit. - Why did they do it? Why did your people kill el presidente? - Pick a reason. Shakwell and Oxnard. Damn, I should have seen it coming. - They will pay for this. - Keep dreaming, amigo. These guys are experts at getting away with this kind of shit. We gotta keep moving. - You still think you are giving the orders, huh? - You're still giving me shit. Why change a winning combination? - Have you thought about where you are going? If I may ask? - I just keep heading north, sooner or later, I end up right where I started a few days ago. - Then you don't care if Shakwell and Oxnard get away with this? - You hold it right there. Let's forget for a moment that the entire country is trying to hunt us down. What I won't forget is all I want to do is get the fuck out of Santa Brava as fast as possible. - If that's your choice, we should be heading that way. It's more safe. - That's solid jungle out there. - I know this country. If we go that way, we can find food and water. (calm music) I uh, I have a sister there. - A sister? - What? It surprises you that I have a family? - After what I went through today, nothing can surprise me anymore. - She can take care of us, hide us. Until it's safe for you to cross the border. Sound like a plan? - Lead the way, Jose. - I didn't give a shit about the others. You were supposed to kill Benson and Ramirez. - It'll happen. - It'll happen. It'll happen when, you fuck up? If Benson gets to the border and squeals to the international news media, we are in deep, deep shit! Am I making myself perfectly clear? - Crystal. (David pants) - Hey Miguel. Your sister. Is she by any stretch of the imagination good looking? - Gringo, don't even think about it! If she doesn't cut your balls off, I will, with a rusty knife, okay? - Okay. Chill out, man. I'm just asking. Maybe it's the personality. Would it offend you if I ask about her? (tense music) (Miguel and David scream) (men shout in a foreign language) Really know this country, do you? (tense music) (door knocks) - Come in. - [Azusas] Isabela. - My dear senor Azusa. - My profound condolences, Isabela. This is a tragic day. - My Fernando is dead, which means you are now the acting president of Santa Brava. - I assume that role with no great joy, senora. - Glad to hear it, senor. Because you're under arrest. - What? - We have reason to believe that senor Azusas may be working with the guerrillas, and that he in fact orchestrated your husband's assassination. - But that is insane! Fernando and I have been friends since childhood. - Pending the conclusion of our investigation, senor Azusas, I'm afraid that we must place you under protective custody. - General Baez, are you taking the word of this- ? - There will be no further discussion of this matter. Take him away. - Trust no one, senora presidenta, especially these Americanos. If anyone is responsible for your husband's death, it is them! - So, what's your progress with Benson and Ramirez? - Borders are sealed. Major Oxnard is personally scouring every square foot of the country. - These murderers were able to escape from your Major Oxnard and the federales today. Two men surrounded by an army. And you tell me they still live? - I will deliver their heads to you personally, senora presidenta. - Do that, colonel. And quickly. (intense music) - [Man On Radio] Investigating officials for the government believe that David Benson and capitan Ramirez were part of a larger conspiracy. Local guerrillas subsidized by Colombian drug cartels are believed to have participated. Casillas' policies have long opposed drug trafficking within our borders. - Muerta! They've been broadcasting a description of the two assassins. A gringo and a capitan federale who betrayed his country. I suppose they will be offering a huge reward. What is your name, senor? - We didn't do it. - That's a very strange name. - We were set up by a couple of guys who supposedly hired us to protect the president. - Of course, the federales would never dirty their hands with a direct attack on the presidente, which explains the two of you. - Exactly, the psychotic mercenary and a turncoat federale. Now that we've got that straight, so please can you- - They say presidente Azusa has probably been arrested and quietly removed by now, and senora presidenta, she will have little to say except which dress she wears tomorrow. And so the generales slowly take back the country. - Look, this has been fun and educational, and we can keep speculating all night. The point is we didn't do it. So if you please can untie me and my friend- - Not yet, senor. - Why not? - Because I truly do not believe your story. - Oh, this is bullshit! Look, if it's not asking too much, can you please ask Frehancho, your leader. - Senor, you are speaking to her. Can we trust him? - [Miguel] He's not one of them. - Miguel? - Casillas is the one you were supposed to keep alive. - You always said they would find a way to kill him. I have to amend now. All right, Theresa. - Pablito, untie him. - Wait a minute. She's your... ? - I'm the one who got the good looks. She got the brains. (calm upbeat music) - Gracias. - De nada. - It smells like shit. - Hmm. I got it from the water down river from where we relieve ourselves. Mix it with a little coffee and usually, you can't tell the difference. (David laughs) (gun fires) (gun fires) (melancholic music) - Can I see that piece, por favor? (Miguel speaks a foreign language) (Miguel speaks a foreign language) Butt of the rifle against my shoulder, elbow on the knee, cheek on the stock. Notice how steady the barrel is now? You try. Okay now focus your eye on the front sight, not the target. I know it doesn't sound logical. Just try it. (Miguel speaks a foreign language) (gun fires) - Okay good. Now try again. And this time, don't jerk back the trigger. Just squeeze, okay? (men speak a foreign language) (upbeat music) - [Miguel] Muy bien, muy bien amigo. - Hey, Joselito. Squeeze. They have a lot of spirit, Theresa. But they're a long way from being real soldiers. - At one time in his life, neither was David Benson. - I wish back then, somebody would have told me what you should tell them. Go home and stop playing with guns. - Perhaps I would, if they had homes they could go back to. You see many of them, they are orphans. Their families murdered by the same generales who now hunt for you. If they had only someone like you, Benson. - My name is David. - If they only had someone like you David to train them. - Sure, let's build up some false hopes that they might be able to take on a real army. Might as well be teaching them how to dig their own graves, lady. 'Cause that's all I'd really be doing. - Is there no shred of faith left in your soul, David? - Sorry, no. I've seen what happens to kids like these when you toss them into the meat grinder of combat. It ain't a pretty sight. - Theresa! Maybe he's right. - And maybe he's just a coward. - Hermana! - No. - If being a coward means I'm sick and tired of people dying around me, then maybe you're right. - I too am sick and tired of people dying! I too came out to the border to escape, but it would not stop the dying! (tense music) - Senora presidenta! This cannot continue. - Excuse me, senator? - Our congress has been abolished. All legislation from the Casillas days has been invalidated by General Baez. - Senor Marquez, I recommend we speak of this matter immediately and in private. - Yes, ma'am. - General Baez. - Senora? - You will join us please. - Yes, ma'am. - I regret to inform you, senora presidenta, but our congressional power has been revoked by these very men. The ability to reverse this travesty still lies in your hands, senora presidenta. The people love you. As they loved your late husband. They would support your decision without question. - You're right, senor Marquez. They do love me. And will believe whatever I tell them. (Marquez gasps) (gun fires) (men groan) - Nice shooting. - General Baez. - Si, senora presidenta. - You will please prepare a statement for the press. - A statement? - It will offer my sincere condolences to the people. These latest assassinations by the blood thirsty and murderous guerrillas have caused me to fear for the safety of the man on the street. - Sounds good. - Regrettably, we are forced to temporarily impose martial law. (Shakwell claps) - Eloquently articulated, senora presidenta. - Oh, thank you. - But if I may suggest, I think it's a grave error for an anonymous voice to convey the announcement to the populace. - Oh, definitely. I agree. The voice of their beloved Isabela must be heard. - If you all insist. Have someone remove this, would you? They're bleeding on my carpet. Until these butchers are brought to justice, we must put our trust in the hands of our loyal military. For these reasons, sadly I must repeat, martial law is now in effect. Regrettably, it is my duty to inform you- - Muerta! - [Isabela] That citizens found on the street after sundown will be arrested and detained. - Hey, wait up. Can you believe that bullshit? Shakwell must have her head so completely turned around. - Do not for a second believe she's so innocent and naive. Do you know what her real family name is? - Yeah, Santiago. I know all about them. - Do you? Really? - Yeah, when they realized your husband wasn't going to tow the company line, they then decided to hire my illustrious- - You keep good company, don't you David? Which explains maybe why you've grown so cynical. - Look, I'm really sorry about this afternoon. - What's there to be sorry about? You expressed your feelings, I expressed mine. You're leaving tomorrow and I'm staying. And the ones who really should be sorry continue lying to the people on national radio. Life goes on. - Hey Theresa, you're not gonna try anything crazy, are you? - Eventually, maybe we will. Unless of course, by some milagro, another Casillas is elected. - Do you realize you don't have a single decent assault rifle? - We'll get one and we'll get another. Nothing is impossible if you still have faith in your heart. - And where, if I may ask, will faith get those rifles for you? - There's an army base about 12 miles from here. - Yeah, heavily guarded, I'm sure. - Tonight, yes, but that will all change tomorrow. Martial law, remember? They'll all be gone to go to the city. - I guarantee you they won't all be gone. Look, you've got kids with BB guns and World War II carbines- - We've made detailed sketches and diagrams, realizing of course, a good plan of attack is needed. - And a few sticks of dynamite wouldn't hurt either. - We have exactly 10. Low yield but loud. (melancholic music) - All right, one week. That's all I'm giving you. At the end of that week, you give me a personal escort to the nearest border. - Deal. Words cannot express my appreciation. Thank you, David. - Benson, you're never gonna learn. (intense music) (men shout) You know the reason that was? Who's next? Oh, Theresa. (David laughs) Come on. Come on! Come on, kill! Come on, kill! Now you're dead. Oops! - My fellow country men. I want to tell you what we know so far about the murder of my husband. Many of you blame the gray beards of my husband's own party. Some have dare accuse my own family members. Some blame the corrupt police and the drug lords who bribe them. But I have proof that the dark hand of the guerrillas is behind my husband's murder. And as for the two criminals who actually murdered- - Quite the little media darling, isn't she? - [Isabela] I can promise you that they will be apprehended. (Theresa grunts) (man grunts) - Good job, Theresa. (men grunt) (man screams) Come on, move. Good job. Come on, guys. Move, move, move. - But I have proof that the dark hand of the guerrillas is behind my husband's murder. And as for the two criminals who actually murdered- - I thought I was quite convincing. - I think you were phenomenal. It's not too hard to understand why you weren't willing to let him give away the family farm. - I believe you Americans refer to it as crossing the line. - Very good. - [Isabela] Mmm. - You're learning. (door knocks) - [Shakwell] Senora presidenta! - [Isabela] Oh God! - [Shakwell] A word please. - [Isabela] One moment. What is it, colonel? - Forgive the intrusion. I wanted to remind you that the generals are waiting for you down stairs. The budget meeting, if you recall. - [Isabela] I did not forget, colonel. Please inform the generals I'll be with them presently. - But of course. Oh, and major, I'll be needing a word with you too. In my office. And if it's not too much trouble, find a pair of pants. Glad you could make it, major. - Pretty girl. Who's she? - Aside from Benson, she may be the greatest threat this new government is facing. - Why? She's spreading the clap? - Listen, lover boy! Allow me to alleviate any further misunderstandings. Your dick is not running this show. I am! - I never said you weren't, sir. You still haven't told me who she is. - Intelligence has been interrogating some of Ramirez's former colleagues. They've dug up some very interesting dirt. Federale capitan, suspected guerrilla leader. Now what does your finely trained military mind determine upon comparing these, hmm? - No fucking way. - It seems like the good captain had a rather incriminating skeleton in his closet. Which may explain why he was so eager to join Benson's little boy scout troop. Now putting two and two together... - If we find her- - We find Ramirez, we find Benson, the whole nest of conspirators. I want you to circulate these, I want you to give copies to your search teams. We're gonna nail these insects, I can smell it. Oh, major, one other thing. Do not allow your extra curricular activities to distract you from the task at hand. - Just servicing the client, colonel. The CIA has spent good money teaching me how to do that. (rocket explodes) (man screams) (men shout in a foreign language) (intense music) (men speak in a foreign language) (man grunts) (Theresa speaks in a foreign language) - Third explosion, we have exactly three minutes. We have to hurry. (man speaks in a foreign language) Hurry. Hurry. Pablo! - Theresa, come here! (Pablo grunts) - Something's wrong. (man shouts in a foreign language) Cover me, I'm going over. - What do you mean? That's not part of the plan. - Just cover me! (guard shouts in a foreign language) - Pablo! I couldn't just sit on my ass, we gotta move! Oh shit. Let's get you out of here. Come on, move, move! Come on! Come on! - Gringo! Get my sister out of there now! - Change of plans, Theresa. You drive. - Headquarters. First infantry battalion. They were hit about a half an hour ago. Clean and professional. Right out of the textbook. - Benson. - Yeah. - Benson. Why is this Benson so hard to kill, gentlemen? - He won't be so hard to kill once we find him. - And when will that be, major? The next ice age? - Bitch. - I'll head out to the army base. Benson and whoever's helping him can't be far off. And by the way, it's senora presidenta bitch. - Thank you, major. - De nada. (melancholic music) - What was that you said about the meat grinder of combat? - It ain't a pretty sight. That's all we can do for right now. - Grazias. David Benson. - You saved his life, David. - I cleaned and stitched his wounds. Now let's see if he's going to make it past the fever and the infection. - Somehow, I have a feeling he will. Viva jefe Benson. Viva jefe Benson! - [All] Viva! - [Theresa] Viva jefe Benson! - [All] Viva! (men speak in a foreign language) - You sure it's necessary to hide the weapons? - Our camp is too close to the army base. The people who are looking for us may be rotten, but they ain't dumb. - So I suppose you want that escort now? To the border. - Well, uh... - Come on, come on, I'll show you the way. It's a lot closer than you thought. - Theresa! I don't think it's a good idea. I mean, people are looking for us, remember? - Miguel, my dear hermano, people have been looking for us since the day we came here. - I don't think it's a good idea. - How do you know? I'm the one who's been living in the jungle for five years, not you. David, you coming or no? Where did you learn how to sew a wound like that? Were you a doctor? - Green beret. They don't just show us how to kill people, you know? - No, I didn't know. It's a lot of things about you I don't know, David. I still don't know if you are leaving or if you are staying. - Was that the purpose of the little trip here? To help me make up my mind? - It's right over there. The border. - Beautiful. Beautiful view. So how does a pretty girl like you end up in a place like this? - It was no planned. I just finished college in Venezuela. It was a bad time for Santa Brava. As bad as now. Maybe worse. (melancholic music) One night, the Santiagos came with their soldiers. My mother and my father were shot. And my brother, Miguel, they beat him for two days. He was just left for dead. And me, they took me with them. And when they were finished, they left me in the jungle to die. Some survivors in the village, they found me, maybe 20 children. A few older people. When I grew stronger, I stayed with them. - And Miguel? - Miguel? Miguel, he thought things could be better changed from the inside. When he realized how impossible it was, he started to give us information. Sometimes I say too much. Come on, let's go back to the camp now. - I'll stay a bit. There's a couple of things I need to think over. - I'll see you later? - You will. - [Miguel] So, how did the border look? - Couldn't really see it. - Oh no? Busy doing something else? What? Maybe if I escort you there, you're gonna have better luck. - That's rather generous of you, Miguel. What's up? - You know what's up. - I think it's time we stick to the original plans, Gringo. Time for you to leave Santa Brava before things get too hot. - I'll make that decision when I decide the time is right. - Time for you to leave is now and there are two ways you can do it, the easy way or the hard way. And the hard way, I guarantee, is gonna hurt. - Does this mean we're finally gonna have our little talk? - Up to you, amigo. - Then I guess, then I guess it's that time. (intense music) (Miguel screams) (both grunt) (David screams) (both scream) - [Miguel] Get in. Get in there. (both scream) (helicopter blades whir) - Huh? (guns fire) - [Miguel] Theresa! Theresa! - [David] Oh no! - Jefe, they have taken her! - [David] Who took her? - Federales and soldiers. When we came back to the camp, it was an ambush. - They took her where, Joselito? - In that helicopter. Then it was over. - She's alive? Esta viva? - Si. - You know what they're doing, don't you? She's bait! - Fine. We have guns now. We take their bait. - Slow down, Miguel. We need to plan. - It's easy for you to say, Gringo. She's not your blood. - No, this is not easy for me to say Miguel, and we still need a plan. (intense music) (men speak in a foreign language) (door knocks) - Come in. - Senora presidenta, the prisoner's here. - Thank you, captain. - Bring her in. (man speaks in a foreign language) - Sir. - Welcome, Theresa Ramirez. I'm colonel Shakwell, and this is senora presidenta Casillas. That was a very impressive little job you pulled at the army base. I don't suppose you had any professional help, did you? - Answer him! I said answer him! - Santiago garbage, you're not fit to walk in Fernando Casillas' shadow! - Hold her back! - No, stop it! - After you have finished with her, she's mine. - Is that before or after her brother shows up? - Right. There would be a certain poetic justice if we allow them to witness each other's torture. I'll wait. - Ah, off to change her soiled dress. Poor dear. You know, deep down, she's really quite sweet. - Do any of us really have time to dig that deep? - Enough with this, take her out! - Follow me! (tense music) - Okay. Let's go. Vaya con dios. - No way I'm letting you get killed, gringo. I still haven't finished kicking your ass yet. - My beloved people, the policies and mandates of my husband shall live on through me. You are hurting me! I have assumed the office of president by emer- I can't see myself! By emergency order of the People's Congress. You trusted Fernando Casillas. I now beg you to place that same trust in me. - And you have my vote. (man grunts) - Hey. Amigo. (man grunts) (man speaks in a foreign language) - People of Santa Brava, this is a historic night for all of us. For tonight, we enter into a partnership, a marriage, if you will. - For tonight, we go to hell. - My beloved people, the policies and mandates of my husband shall live on through me. (rocket explodes) (man screams) (Isabela gasps) (men shout) (man screams) - Benson! - I... I have uh... You have trust... You trusted Fernando Casillas, I now beg you to place that- I now beg you to place that same trust in me. (man screams) What's going on? Do something! I'm not paying you to stand around looking stupid! - Okay, senora presidenta. (man screams) - [David] Who are you? Where's the girl? - In the jail cells, most likely. You must be this Benson they keep talking about. - Si, senoras el presidente, he is. - Then your enemy is mine. I must get to the captain of the guard. - Okay, come with me. - Miguel, meet me at the TV studio. - Okay! - Please, you have to come with us. The guerrillas have broken through! Please! - Don't you touch me! (Miguel yelps) - David! - Stay back! Sorry we took so long. - Where's Miguel? - Kicking some ass. Hey, where are you going? - To find senora presidenta. I have an old debt to repay. - That might help. - Drop it, David. I'm serious. Sorry we had to set you up, old buddy. But you were just such a- - Perfect target? - Yeah. - No problem, man. I'll live. - Not this time, David. This time, it's adios. - Adios. (intense music) (Shakwell screams) (men shout in a foreign language) (man shouts in a foreign language) - This must stop now! - But senora Mr. Presidente, the guerrillas- - The guerrillas are not the enemy, my friend. (David groans) (Shakwell grunts) - I know where your sister is. We can make a deal, trust me. - Never, hijo de puta. (Shakwell screams) (gun fires) - Training sure paid off. Find Isabela? - Don't worry, I will. You know, you answered a very important question for me tonight, David. - Which is? - You're staying, aren't you? - No! (gun fires) (Theresa groans) (melancholic music) (indistinct) - No? I'm the one who is leaving. - Don't worry, Benson. She won't be lonely. You are about to join her. You thought you could ruin everything for me, didn't you? You and your filthy guerrilla friends. But I'm a Santiago, senor Benson. Don't you realize that my family has owned this country for over 50 years? (men shout in foreign language) That I own it now. That its people are just insects. (men shout in foreign language) Puppets whom we control. - You had your husband assassinated, didn't you? - Fernando. Fernando was a fool. He only cared for his poor, unwashed masses. He lacked vision. He was a rotten lover. (men shout in foreign language) - Don't take this the wrong way, senora presidenta, but you've just totally lost it. - Not compared to what you are about to lose. - Smile. (men shout in a foreign language) - David! The fighting's over! The palace is ours. - And Baez has been placed under arrest. - No! Theresa. Theresa. Who did this? Who did this? - [Crowd] Isabela! Isabela! Isabela! Isabela! - This so called victory of yours will only turn out to be a bad joke. The people are still mine. You will see. - Miguel, no. - Move! - Okay. - [Isabela] Get out of my way! - [Crowd] Isabela! Isabela! Isabela! Isabela! Isabela! Isabela! Isabela! Isabela! Isabela! Isabela! Isabela! Isabela! Isabela! Isabela! - Talk to them, Isabela. Talk to your people. They are waiting. - My people, here is the assassin of my beloved Fernando. - You killed him! (crowd shouts) (tense music) (Isabela grunts) - David, no! Those putas will tear you apart! (indistinct) (Isabela shouts in a foreign language) - Senora presidenta. I believe your people would like to have a word with you. - Help me, no! (Isabela screams) Help me, help me! (Isabela screams) (melancholic music) - You still need someone to show you to the border, amigo? - I'll stick around for a while, if it's okay with you. - It's a free country now. Thanks to you. - Us. And a few others who couldn't be here today. - To your memory, hermana. Theresa. - Theresa. Didn't you and I have something to finish? - I think so, but you know something? I can't remember what it was. - It's right on the tip of my tongue. - Maybe it was this. - Works for me, amigo. It sure works for me. (upbeat music) - Salut. - Salut.
