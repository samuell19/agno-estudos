Hey, Homer. Hop on my bike and rush this over to Nettie Putnam, it's a telegram. Hurry and I'll give you a nickel. You wouldn't fool me, would you? Nine three ring two two. Nine three ring two two is busy. It's always busy. Sorry, it's a party wire. Oh, hello, Clara. I was just going to call you. I've got my dishes washed and I thought I'd give you a ring. What kind of a time did you have at Grandma Kern's party? Just so-so. Ha, imagine her trying to pass off for 60. If you ask me, she won't last the winter out. Did you hear that? Somebody's listening in. It's getting so you can't have any privacy at all. I've been on a party wire 15 years and I never listened in. I'd die first. Me too. I'll call you back later. Goodbye. Nine three ring two two. Hello? Been trying to get you for 10 minutes. It's that Matilda Sherman. She's like a babbling brook when she gets to talking. Grandma, got some news for you. The Limited's stopping. What's popping? Not popping, stopping. The Limited. Guess who's getting off. Give up? Matt Putnam. Matt Putnam. Well, bless my soul. Bert. Bert. Bert, guess who's coming back to Rockridge. Prosperity. No, Matthew Putnam. Matthew Putnam? Mm-hm. Oh Ma, get me a pitcher of ice water, will you? What, again? Hey, Charlie, Matt Putnam's coming in today on the Limited. Here? Irene, what do you suppose? Hurry up, get dressed. Here, I'll -- What on Earth is the matter? Matter of plenty. Matthew Putnam's coming home. Married or single? That's what we're gonna find out. Well, Matt Putnam's getting in today. Nettie Putnam's nephew? Yeah. On the Limited. Come in, come in. Telegram, Miss Nettie. Must be something important. Well, read it to me. Your prodigal nephew arriving Rockridge, 11:00 AM. Matthew. My, isn't it wonderful? These telegrams, how fast news can travel? Mmm. Telephone's good, too. I'll send Joe to the station with the car right away. I've already sent him. I wonder where everybody's going. Crazy, I suppose. Hello, Marge. Hello, Mrs. Bradwiss. Well, they're going someplace in an awful hurry. There's only two things can make people hurry in this town. One is something for nothing, and the other's a run on the bank. Hey, I put the trunks back there so there's-- Nice trip. Thank you, sir. Well, well, if it ain't old Matt Putnam himself in person, not a motion picture. How are you old boy, old boy, old boy? You don't remember me, do you? Sure, you're the kid who used to sit in back of me at school and put red ants down my neck. That's me, Bert West. Some fun, huh? Oh, you remember my mother. How do you do, Mr. Putnam? How are you? We're always glad to welcome our-- Well, how are you, Joe? Fine, Mr. Putnam. Where's the car? Why, right over there. I'll get the baggage. Hello boys, glad to see you. Well, Matthew Putnam. Oh, uh-- Now, don't say you've forgotten me. Well, let me see. You're, uh-- Out of sight, out of mind. I'm Mrs. Sherman. How are you, Mrs. Sherman? I'm Irene's mother. You remember Irene. Let me take the bags, Joe. Excuse me, Mrs. Sherman. Well, you're a big help. Seems a bit snooty, doesn't he? I should say so. Oh, he's all right. Matthew! Deborah. Hey, what's that? A fire? Oh, that's Miss Nettie. She's been having tantrums waiting for you. Come on. Don't forget to knock. Why all the formality? Better break all the 10 Commandments than go to Miss Nettie's room without knocking. Come in. You're not crippled, are you? She hasn't changed a bit. Where have you been? I heard the train whistle 20 minutes ago. Aunt Nettie, what a welcome. What a welcome after seven years. What did you want me to do? Get up and dance a highland fling for you? Oh, stop grinning like a Cheshire cat and sit down over there where a body can see you. He looks thin, Miss Nettie. He needs some nice home cooking. Rubbish, he looks positively bloated. Get out, Deborah, and get that silly grin off your face. I fixed you some gingerbread with whipped cream. Great. Aunt Nettie, I can't tell you how wonderful it is to be home again. Rats! What? I said, rats! If it had been wonderful, you could be here anytime in the last seven years. Don't tell me you brought me from Europe just to give me a bawling out. You've had your education, your fling, and your foolishness. Now it's time to settle down. Me, settle down in Rockridge? Oh, no. And why not? Your grandfather founded Rockridge. The whole town is dependent on the Putnam Dairies. Why, you're the only living Putnam beside myself. I know how you feel about it. It's a matter of sentiment with you, but, I've outgrown all that. You'll stay and attend to business whether you like it or not. No. No. Yes. Yes! You're like all the Putnams, stubborn as a mule. I see your temper's just as bad as ever. Worse, and I'm glad of it. You're a wonderful woman, Aunt Nettie. I'm an old woman, Matthew. You know how long it's been since you went away? It's been seven years, six months, and 10 days. I know it's not a very agreeable prospect for you, cooped up here with a quarrelsome old invalid. Please. I've carried on for you for long time. I'm tired, Matthew. And I'm old. It's your turn now. After all, it is your business. I'll tell you what. We'll give the dairy business back to the Indians. You and I will get in a boat, take a trip around the world. Oh no, we won't. Oh yes, we will. Oh no, we won't. Oh yes, we will. Oh no, we won't. Oh, yes. [Oh, no. Hiya Matty old boy, old boy. Hello there. Taking an afternoon stroll? No, I'm just calling on some friends. Hop in, I'll drive you over. No thanks, I'm enjoying the walk. Would you like a drink of imported scotch? Where's it imported from? Waysville. The nearest thing to Paris in these parts. You and me could have a swell time in Waysville. Irene. There he is now. I guess we understand each other. Well, anytime you feel frisky look me up. Going into Will Oliver's. You'd think he'd be more particular who he calls on. Now's your chance. Get on over there. Well, maybe I better phone Marge first. No, just run over. Tell Marge I want the recipe for that angel cake. Get him away and bring them over here for tea. Oh, Mom-- Go on, go on. Hurry up. And straighten up your back. Put your chin out. I'll powder your nose and you'll do for today. Is it that funny? What do you think? The whole town's all dressed up waiting for you to call, and here on your first visit I spray you with bug powder. Maybe you're right. Hey, you're not Marge Oliver. I am. What, that funny, homely little freckle-faced kid? You weren't so good looking yourself. I remember when you used to call on Dad, your feet were so big you tripped over everything. I still do. Say, Dad will be awfully glad to see you. He's out back painting the barn. I mean, he was painting the barn. If I'm not mistaken, that's what he was doing when I left here seven years ago. It's a contract for him. Is he still the town's best fisherman? He works hard enough at it. Dad, look who's here! Matthew Putnam. Well, doggone my old hide. Hello, Matt. I'm glad to see you, Will. Glad? I'm so glad I could dance a jig. Let me look at you. Dadgum. Well, I'll be dadgummed. You, it is. Yoo-hoo, Marge. I'm sorry, I didn't know you had company. Why, Matthew Putnam. Of all people. Hello, Irene. What are you all primped up for? I guess all the girls will be primping up now that you're back, Matt. Mother was just ordering tea when I left. Do come and join us. Well, I, uh-- Tea? I got something better than tea. Tea's only good for old women. Come on in the kitchen, Matt. Excuse me. Coming in, Irene? No, thanks. I'll be going. Come and see us soon, Matthew. I'll promise not to entertain you in the kitchen. But I like kitchens. Care to stay to dinner, Mr. Putnam? Well, uh-- Sure he'll stay. Set another place and don't ask foolish questions. All right. Good. Now this here is a drink for heroes. Heroes is right. Pretty good stuff. It ought to be, I made it myself. Hello, Roy. Hello, Marge. Gee, you look pretty. Thank you. We've got company. Matthew Putnam's here. Oh, that bigshot with all the money that everybody's breaking their necks for? He'll hear you. Mr. Putnam, this is Mr. Daniels. How do you do? Don't think you were in Rockridge when I left, were you? I guess not. Roy blew and with a rainstorm one night, and he liked the town so much he's been here ever since. I hate it. Why, it always seemed like a nice little town to me. Our fields are always the greenest. Well, someday I'm gonna find out. Anything's better than staying here and going to seed like some people. Come on in the kitchen, Roy. I'll let you help me with the dishes. Oh, all right. Lippy young fellow, ain't he? Well, you offended his dignity. Guess I must've said something. What's your dad always picking on me for, Marge? He wasn't picking on you. You shouldn't take him so seriously. Well, he talks too much. Touchy. Only small-minded people take offense at everything. Gee, it's lovely out here. Yes indeed. Sit down, Matt. A man don't need much more than a roof over his head, peace and quiet, and, a good pipe. That's right, Will. I'm glad to be home. I feel like I'm back where I belong. Listen to those frogs croaking. Yeah, there are lots of them around here. Irene went over there to invite him to tea, but he turned her down cold. I guess he prefers applejack to tea. He's over there now. I can see him from my window. Seems strange after being away for seven years that the Olivers would be the first people he'd call on. Oh well, Will Oliver's full of applejack anyway. Makes his own. It's no good. Synthetic. I don't mind synthetic gin, but when it comes to applejack, that has to be made properly. Isn't it possible to get a little service in this bank? Oh, hello. I didn't see you standing there. Shall I go out and come back in again? Sure, go ahead if you think it'll help. I thought I'd drop in and get my statement. You got your statement yesterday. Did I? That's right. It's funny how you forget those things. Isn't it about closing time? So it is. You didn't forget that, did you? Look, if you see an old man outside with a beard and a brand new car, it's me. Oh, Mr. Putnam? Yes, Miss Oliver? A long gray beard? Well, Matthew, this is a pleasant surprise. How is your dear, sweet aunt? Oh, she's a little-- We're still waiting for you to come to tea. He's going to come to dinner with us, aren't you? Well, I-- A nice home-cooked dinner. Why don't you come with us now, and you and Irene can talk over your childhood days together. Remember, Matthew? I'd like to, Mrs. Sherman, but I'm afraid that I-- Oh, please don't say no. Well, I'm-- He's not going to say no. Oh yes he is, Mrs. Sherman. He has a very important engagement, and he's afraid he'll miss it. Excuse me. Bye. Looking for someone, Miss? Yes, I'm looking for an old man with a long gray beard. I just saw him go around the corner. Hop in, we'll catch him. So that's the important engagement he was about to miss. I don't know what he sees in Marge Oliver. I hate to tell you this, Clara, you know I never gossip, but Irene saw them out at Willow Creek this afternoon. That's funny. Bert was out that way this afternoon and he saw them too. And they were holding hands. Come in. Hello, Aunt Nettie. Well, how do you feel now? Still want to give the dairy business back to the Indians? Now where'd you get that idea? I love the dairy business. Love this town, and all the people in it. People? Sure. Why, you couldn't drag me away. I even think I'll learn how to milk cows. Wonderful what a pretty face will do. How did you enjoy your trip up to Willow Creek? How did you know about that? A little bird told me. Told me you were holding hands, too. Your little bird exaggerates. I haven't got that far yet. I want to warn you, Matthew. Be careful. Gossip in a village like this travels like a prairie fire. So it seems. What I can't figure out is how it got to you so fast. I just took Marge home. How did you find out about it? Magic. I'm more than a sick old woman, Matthew. I'm a witch, seeing into the hearts of all the people in Rockridge. I wish you could tell me what's in her heart. Maybe I will, someday. Anyhow, I'm glad to be under your spell. Come back and have dinner with me. I will if you promise not to try any of your magic on that apple pie Deborah's baking. It's a cherry pie. It's an apple pie. I told her to bake a cherry pie. And I told her to bake an apple pie. It's a cherry pie. It's an apple pie. Cherry! Apple! Dad. I thought so. I just came out to get myself a drink. You're telling me? Of water. Help yourself. Hey, where you going with that? What do you care? You want a drink of water. Now let's see, where were we? Sunday school chairs. Fifteen dollars and ten cents. Right. Church social. Groceries, $10.50. Ice cream, five dollars. Prizes, 12 dollars. All itemized and receipted. Don't get them mixed up. Are you catching cold? I wouldn't be surprised. You better take a dose of that cough medicine. No, no, I don't want any of that. It tastes awful. You'll take it and like it. It's in the kitchen. Uh, where'd you say it was? You go to bed, Dad. I'll get it for you. Nasty old stuff. Take a good big dose of that. All right, you're the doctor. Uh, bindings for the hymn books, $8.75. Or is that $7.85...? Marge, what's Matthew Putnam been hanging around here so much for lately? Oh, he's crazy about Dad. I suppose it was your dad who drove out to Willow Creek with him yesterday. No, that was me. Yeah, he's got a swell new car and half the money in Rockridge. That's no drawback. Well, it's driving me crazy, Marge. People are laughing at me. What are you talking about, Roy? That doesn't make sense. No sense to my being in love with you and crazy jealous every time he looks at you? You have no right to feel that way. We're not engaged. That's all right for you to say now, but you've known all along that I was crazy about you. No, I didn't. I knew that you liked me very much, and I'm fond of you, but that isn't being in love. You don't have to stall me. I know where I stand now. I'm clearing out of this one-horse town. Well, where would you go, Roy? To New York, where a fella's got a chance. And don't you think I won't make good, either. Someday when I'm a bigshot like Matthew Putnam maybe you'll change your tune. You wouldn't do anything so foolish as that. Don't you be surprised if I'm on that milk train when it pulls out tomorrow morning. Good night, Roy. Good-bye! Dang it. How late you gonna sit up? I don't know. Well, you know it's 9 o'clock. I can't help it, Dad. There's something the matter with these accounts. I can't get them to balance. That's too bad. I must've fallen asleep. The lights are still on over at Will Oliver's. He acts worried. Probably got heartburn. Want to come to bed? I'll be up in a minute. You'd think it was New Year's Eve the way everybody was sitting up. Dadgummit. You know what time it is? Ten o'clock. The electric light bill's been getting pretty big lately. I'm sorry, Dad, but I'm short $62.50 of the church money. Well, let it go till morning, Roy'll find it for you. Roy may not be here in the morning, he says he's going to New York. New York? Kind of sudden, ain't it? Yes. A wonder he'd be skipping out of town just when some of the church money is missing. You go to bed, I'll find it. What's the matter with Roy helping you find it? Nobody's touched that money but you and him. I'll get him over here. You're not going to phone him this time of night. I don't care what time of night it is, he's coming over here and face the music. I want Nan Martin's boardinghouse, and make it snappy. Dad, I don't want you to make any trouble about this. I'll make plenty of trouble if that young whippersnapper-- Hello? Mrs. Martin? Yeah, I want to talk to Roy Daniel. He hasn't come in yet. Tell him to call Will Oliver soon as he comes in. I'll leave a note for him. He's not there. I wouldn't be surprised if he's already skipped out with that money. He wouldn't do a thing like that. Well, I wouldn't put it past him. I never did like him no how. Nine three ring one two. Hello? Hello, Clara. There's something doing over at Will Oliver's house. Old Will's been pacing the floor mad as a hornet. You suppose it's about Marge? Well, what else would it be about? Guess I'll sit up for a while. I guess I will too. I don't feel a bit sleepy. Call me back later. Good night. Nine three ring two. Hold everything, boys. Hello, Will? You get over here as fast as your legs will carry you. I don't know what you're talking about. If you think you're going to sneak out of town and leave Marge in a fix like this, you're gonna find out different. Dad, don't make a-- You keep out of this, Marge. You better get over here or I'm coming after you with a gun. You can't order me around. Nobody's got any strings on me. You got something to settle, and if you know what's good for you, you'll come on over here and do it. Give me that. Roy, please. Oh, all right. Well, that's a hot one, boys. What's going on? All right, here I am. What's it all about? What's your hurry about getting out of town? Now, Dad, I'll tell Roy. Roy, it's about the church account. Sixty-two dollars and a half missing. Well, you don't think I took it, do you? Well, if you didn't, where is it? Let me see that ledger. $62.50. Isn't that what we paid the orchestra the night of the barn dance? The barn dance? Yeah, I paid them in cash out of the ticket money. Oh, that's where it is. Oh, I forgot to enter it. You had a lot of nerve to think that I'd take it. Just goes to show you that the best of us can be wrong. I'll offer you a little drink, Roy, if Marge will give me the key to the cellar. No thanks, I never touch it. And her going around looking so pure and innocent. You'd think butter wouldn't melt in her mouth. Well, you know the old saying, "Still waters run deep." No fooling? Yeah. Do my ears deceive me, or do I hear wedding bells ringing? I don't think they'll have time to send to California for the orange blossoms. Just goes to show you never can tell. That's right, Ma. The smartest of us get fooled sometimes. I guess that'll be a blow to Matthew Putnam when he finds out. What's the matter, Ma? What's all the excitement about? Nothing that concerns you. Run along to bed now. This is not for your pretty little ears. Run along, run along. Now let that be a lesson to you, Paul. I know, but what's Roy done? Well, if you ain't old enough to know what he's done, go on back to sleep. "New York, I says? Well, you ain't going to New York, are you, Roy?" He says, "I sure am, that's why I'm buying the ticket." So he got on the train and went. Pretty smart, skipping out of town and leaving Will to hold the sack. Well, it's going to make it tough for me if Marge is fired. You're soft as butter, T.P. Well, it's just like kicking her and Will out of town. That's where she ought to be, out of town. We're respectable folks. We can't have girls like Marge setting an example for decent young people. You're upholding her by letting her stay in the bank. Well, I think you're going a little too far. There never was a man that didn't stand up for that kind of woman. Now see here, T.P. It's my money invested in that bank, and you're going to do as I say or I'll make you wish you never married me. What did you say? I didn't say it. Nine three ring one two. Hello. Hello, Clara. This is me. You know that party we were talking about? Well, she's going to get fired this morning. If you haven't anything to do, be ready in 15 minutes and we'll drive down to the bank. I'll be ready. I'll be ready. Morning, T.P. Hello, Grandma. What are you doing at the bank this morning? Well, I came to get one of them safe deposit boxes. Nice day for it. The old carpet sweeper's out to pick up the dirt. What's all the excitement about? Looks like bargain day. Maybe. Morning. Hello, Ma. Hello, Bert. Good morning. Got blood in her eye this morning. Oh, may I speak with you a moment, Miss Oliver? Certainly, Mr. Sherman. I, uh... we, uh... we have decided to dispense with your services as of today. Well, I don't understand. Hasn't my work been satisfactory? Sure. Sure, your work's been fine. Well, what is it then? Well, it's just that, uh, well, we can get along without you, that's all. I see. You mean Mrs. Sherman doesn't want me here any longer. I knew she ran a lot of things in this town, but this is the first time I ever knew she ran the bank. Uh, Marge. I'm very sorry about this. You needn't feel sorry for me. I'll get along all right. You're the one who needs the sympathy, Mr. Sherman. You don't even dare to call your soul your own. What do you mean? Don't worry, Christmas is coming. Maybe your wife will give you a dog collar. Going to lunch kinda early, ain't you? He was coming Around the bend Goodbye, my lover Goodbye Loaded down with hungry men Goodbye, my lover Good-- How you coming? Fine, how you getting along? At the rate I'm going now, I'll be finished in no time! Mathilda Sherman brought the florist from Springfield over to fix her exhibit. Sure seems to put so much tin foil and gold paint on them flowers, it looked like one of them Rest in Peace horseshoes he gives out for funerals. That's an idea. If I don't win, you can use this for my funeral. Maybe I better give you a hand. All right, you can go out in the woods and get me some ferns. Clear over to Willow Creek! Well, I guess I'd better finish painting the barn while I'm in the mood. Maybe you'd better. Hello, Matt! Hello, Will. I see you've painted your barn. Pretty near, it won't be long now! Hello, Matt. Hello. You're late, I didn't think you'd get here. Takes a long time to go clear to Willow Creek and get ferns. These don't look like Willow Creek ferns to me. Young lady, I've always been taught it was the height of impropriety to look a gift horse in the mouth. You bought them. Who, me? Spend a dollar for ferns when all you've got to do is drive 20 miles to Willow Creek, wear out a pair of $16 shoes climbing over rocks, catch pneumonia from wet feet and pay a $50 doctor bill? Don't be silly. Well, anyway, they're beautiful. Seems like a lot of trouble to go to for a mere flower show. Have you forgotten the prestige that goes with winning the flower show in Rockridge? It's an institution around here. We've been having one every year since 1880. Hey, Mac. You know anything about thinning out paint? Well, unfortunately, Will, they didn't teach that when I went to school. That's too bad. I need a little help out here right now. Oh, did you say "thinning out paint"? Well, that's one of the fondest things I'm of. What are you two up to? Guess that'll have to do for the time being. That's a mighty fine brand of linseed oil you got there, Will. Sure, I make it mysel-- I mean, I gotta go over to the hardware store! The boat was coming Around the bend Goodbye, my lover Goodbye Do you need any more pink roses? No, but I could use one of Cole and Kelly's nicest bricks. Bricks? What for? Ink nest, little darling. A thing of beauty is a joy forever. Say, what's going on here? Behold, the exhibit that will soften the rock-bound hearts of Rockridge. You're a big help. That Lem Davis will put an editorial in his paper about it. Marge Oliver not only wins first prize at the flower show, but wins the Pulitzer Prize, as well! What's the matter? Marge? Why, you're crying. No, I'm not. I didn't dream you were taking this thing so seriously. I thought you'd get a big kick out of old Crazy Camp. Well, you wouldn't understand it. It isn't the money, but-- But if you were in my boots, you'd know how much it means to win this thing tomorrow. All right. If that's the way you feel, let's get busy and win it. Loaded down with hungry men Goodbye, my lover Goodbye The boat was coming Around the bend Goodbye, my lover Goodbye Loaded down with hungry men Goodbye, my lover Goodbye Pretty good stuff, Will! Ought to be, I make it myself. Dad? Thanks, Lem! Appreciate that very much. That's mighty nice of you. Hello, honey. Time to sit down? Come to order, everybody! Look at that. Ain't that the prettiest thing in the county? Prettiest thing in the world. If 26 ain't the winning number, I'll eat my hat. Ladies and gentlemen. As president of the Rockridge Flower Society, I greet you. Why don't they cut out the blabber and get down to brass tacks? And now, let me introduce a man who needs no introduction: Judge Steven Stevenson! My friends, this is indeed an honor. A signal honor. I don't know very much about flowers, my friends, but I know more about politics than any man in the state. Maybe this ain't the place to talk about politics. But I can't resist a few well-chosen words. I've always fought against corruption. If any man dares to say a word against me, let him rise and speak. Take it away, take it away! Gee whiz. Who dares accuse me? Who dares to stand up and--? Thank you, judge, it's a bee. You go right on talking, judge, you don't bother me a bit. Thank you very much, judge. Judge Stevenson will now give out the prizes. About time you give out something. "The judges have unanimously agreed that number A26-- I knowed it! I knowed it all along! Will the talented person who originated this beautiful exhibit please step forward to receive the first prize? Right here, judge, right here! Go on, Marge, go on up and get it! Marge Oliver. You're not going to let her get away with it, are you? I should say not. We've made a mistake. What's the matter? There has been an unfortunate error. We find that number A26 has been disqualified. Disqualified? What for? The committee can disqualify any entry without giving reason. Yeah, how come? If she won it, why don't you give it to her? Order! Order! Keep quiet! You can't keep me quiet. I've been stung by a bee here today, but I'm not going to let my daughter be stung by a lot of female hornets. Sit down, will you? You're full of applejack! Mathilda Sherman's trying to put over something shady! Keep still, Dad. I won't keep still! What right does that old hen got to make a lot of rules of her own? I say the exhibit has been disqualified! You're wrong, Mrs. Sherman. I withdraw my entry. That settles the matter. I'll be darned if it does, I want to know the reason. You don't think Mrs. Sherman will tell you, do you? Any more than she'll tell you why a lot of other things have happened to me lately. The entry's withdrawn, that's all. Well, if it's gonna be withdrawn, let's withdraw it right. I got an idea. Hey, I got an idea. Let's go fishing. ...around the bend Goodbye, my lover Goodbye Was loaded down with-- Was loaded down with-- You'd better-- You'd better try that hole right there, I ain't fixed it out lately. That was where we caught that big bass that last time, wasn't it, Will? There you are. All hooked up and guaranteed to catch no less than six juicy pike perch or I'll eat them myself. You're trying awfully hard to cheer me up, aren't you? Well, that was the idea, but it's seemed to have gone astray. No, it hasn't. You've helped a lot. But don't work so hard at it. After all, it really doesn't matter that much. Oh, yes, it does. I've been away from Rockridge so long, I've forgotten just how small a small town can be. I've forgotten all the Mathilda Shermans and the Clara Wests. That's just the trouble. You've forgotten the Mathilda Shermans and the Clara Wests, and they resent it. Why? Because I won't attend their pink teas and Sunday dinners and pat their little children on the head? Exactly. Don't you know that every woman in this town with a marriage-able daughter has been after you since the first day you got here? They think I'm spoiling their chances. Well, that's absurd. Of course it is. Why, they know that your father and I have been pals for years. Well, sure, you just come over to see him, we're just friends, anybody could see that. Of course, you're just like a kid sister to me. It's crazy, isn't it? No, but you are. Rockridge is right. You are spoiling their chances. It isn't your father I come to see. I never thought much of you as a kid sister. And I don't want to be friends. I love you, Marge. Hey, got a bite! Hey, you got a bite! What's the matter with you? Doggone it. I thought you were into it. Don't you-- ...was coming Around the bend Goodbye, my lover Goodbye Loaded down With hungry men Goodbye, my lover Goodbye Boat was-- Well, it's about time you got up, lazy bones. You're up early today. I couldn't sleep. Well, I didn't sleep very good either. I had the heartburn all night. Maybe you'd better not have any of these fish. Well, I'll be all right. The sodium will pick me up. The boat was coming Around the bend What are you so happy about? You're flitting around here like a grasshopper. You'd be happy too if you knew what I know. What do you know I don't know? Oh, Dad. Sweetie, what's the matter with you? It's a secret but I've just got to tell somebody. Well, ain't I somebody? Promise you won't tell? Hmm. Cross your heart and hope to die? Hey, cut it out and let me in on it. I'm going to be married. Matt Putnam? Well, doggone my old hide. You ain't fooling, are you? Is that anything to fool about? Well, doggone my old soul, this calls for a celebration! Only one now, you old blotter. Only one... When did he pop the question? Yesterday, while we were fishing. Wait till Mathilda Sherman hears that one! Heh! She'll throw a conniption fit! But I don't want her to hear it. I don't want anyone to know about it. Until it's all over. Now don't you go talking. Oh, don't worry about me. I won't go shooting off my mouth. Aunt Nettie up yet, Deborah? Yes, and in a roaring temper. That's fine. Just her way of showing affection. So that's your secret, huh? That's what makes you a witch peering into the hearts of Rockridge? The little bird that tells you all these things turns out to be an extension telephone. You've caught me, Matthew. Are you shocked? Well, listening in on a party wire isn't a very edifying way of passing your time. Well, it's better than waiting a week for Lem Davis' newspaper to come out. And you'd be surprised at what I hear even about the best people. There's a juicy scandal brewing right now concerning you. Aunt Nettie, if you get pleasure out of picking up gossip over the telephone, you go right ahead. But don't bother me with it. I'm fond of you, Matthew. And it's my duty to tell you about Marge Oliver. I don't want to hear it. You're going to hear it whether you want to or not. Before Roy Daniels left town, Marge tried to force him to marry and he refused. Just more Rockridge gossip. You might ask him about his hasty departure from town. I wouldn't dream of asking her anything so foolish. Because she's promised to marry me. You can't do it! Oh, yes, I can. I'll tell you something else I can do. I can make the people of this village crawl through mud on their hands and knees to beg her pardon, and I'm gonna start in with Mathilda Sherman. You're acting childish. What keeps Mathilda Sherman alive? Tom Sherman's bank. What keeps Tom Sherman's bank alive? The Putnam deposits. No Putnam money, no bank. And I'm transferring the Putnam Dairy accounts to the Waysville Bank this morning. Simple, isn't it? Have you gone crazy? No, I've just come to my senses. I'm gonna wrap this town up in a paper bag and give it to my wife for a wedding present, and if she wants, she can put a match to it. You can't do it. Who says I can't? I say you can't! Well, I'll show you! You won't show me anything! When it's all over, you can have your laugh. When is it? When is the event coming on? Today. Today? 1:00, he's coming for me and we're going to Springfield where nobody'll see us. An elopement, huh? Oh, Dad, I'm so happy. Dad-burn my old skin, it won't be long now before I'm a grandpappy. Coffee for you now. 1:00, you can start your celebration. Well, where's the cream? I forgot to bring it in. Great day for forgetting, I forgot to wash my face and hands. Good morning, Marge. T'ain't true, is it, honey? Of course not, Dad. Well, then. I wouldn't worry about it, probably nobody seen that thing, anyway. Oh, yes, they did. I heard them laugh. Oh, it's just some reckless foolishness. No, it isn't. It's more than that. -So that's what they've been whispering about. That's why they got rid of me at the bank. And I thought all along it was because they were jealous of Matthew Putnam. I'll bet that's Mathilda Sherman calling Clara West right now. Don't take on so much. Matthew will hear about it. He wouldn't believe it. You believed it. Oh, no, I didn't. Oh, it's unfair, I haven't done anything to them. Of course you haven't. Don't worry. We're not going to let a bunch of gossiping old hens come between you and Matt. Stop crying. Stick out your chin. Why, we'll fight them. You'll forget all about it in a couple of hours, as soon as Matt comes for you. Suppose he doesn't come for me. Don't talk foolish, of course he will. Then, when you get back from Springfield, the shoe'll be on the other foot, and you can have the laugh on them, then. You'd better come have your breakfast. Oh, I'm not hungry. Aren't you coming to breakfast, Dad? No, I'm just going out for a little walk. I'll be back before long. You can think of some of the darndest things, Burke. Some fun, huh? Do you think it's true? You don't think Roy took that trip for his health, do you? That would be my guess! Chiggers, here's Will, now. Hello, Will! Hi, Will, what do you say? Hello, old-timer! Hi, Will. Thinking on getting a shave or a haircut? Neither one. I'm figuring to get the person who started this talk about my daughter. How about you, Bert West? Wasn't me. How about you, Lem? I haven't done anything, Will. Lem Davis, you're a coward and a sneak. Whispering like an old woman behind people's backs. Well, sorry. We didn't mean to injure your feelings. Ain't nothing but talk. No harm in it. Can't stop talk. Well, I'm gonna stop it if I have to shoot somebody. The women started this. You know how women are, Will. Get a heap of pleasure out of talking. Put that gun away. Talk makes the world go 'round. You wanna start suing for libel, I'll handle the case for you. We could sue about half the people in this town. In the county! In the state! Scum. Scum of the earth. "Boom, boom, boom. I'm a cowboy." Haven't you got any better sense than to run around town waving a gun at people? No, I ain't, and I'm gonna shoot-- How long have you lived here? Nevermind, I know, 62 years. Well, I've lived here 67! Don't make no difference. Nobody's going to drag my daughter's name through the mud. Thought you'd come over here to talk to me about something. I did, and I'm not leaving-- Then sit down and cut out the fireworks. If it's a question of who can shout the loudest, maybe you can beat me. Appears to be you're doing most of the shouting. Now, what's on your mind? Nettie, you've always been the fairest-minded woman in this town. I'm in trouble, and you've got to help me. There's no truth in this story about Marge. Then how did it get started? How does anything get started in this town? Didn't you call Roy Daniels up in the middle of the night before he left town? Yeah, that was some mix-up about some church books. Church books? Yeah, he always helped Marge with the bookkeeping. Didn't you tell him to hotfoot it over to your house so you could come after him with a gun? I thought he was skipping out of town with some of the church money, but I was wrong. It was all straightened out the minute he come over. Didn't you tell him he couldn't leave town with Marge in the fix she was in? That was before... Does Matt know about this? Certainly, I told him. What's he gonna do about it? That's up to him. He's old enough to know his own mind. Guess I started out to shoot the wrong man. You did your shooting when you got full of applejack and shot your mouth off over a party wire. You mean, you want to transfer your entire account to us? Every nickel of it. Won't you come in and sit down? Well, I'm in a bit of a hurry. Oh, this won't take a minute, sir. I'll be able to draw on this today for my weekly payroll, I suppose. Uh, yes, sir. No, sir. Well, I don't know, sir. That is, I'll have to get Mr. Croft's okay on that. See, I'm only the assistant manager. Well, where can I find Mr. Croft? He's at lunch right now. You know, Thursday, Rotarian lunch date. Can't you get him on the phone? I'm very anxious to get this matter settled. Well, I'll take a chance. Six-one, please. And fellow Rotarians, let me say these little hours spent away from our desks-- Hello? I want to speak to Mr. Croft. Well, I can't bust in on him right now, he's making a speech. Oh, uh, take a note to him. Tell him Mr. Matthew Putnam of the Rockridge Dairies is here. Yeah, he wants to open an account. He's in a hurry. All right, sir. There are far greater and bigger things. The hearty clasp of a hand. The warm smile of a friend. Uh, and in conclusion, gentlemen, I thank you. Charlie, take over the meeting, something big's just come up How about a little song, boys? For he's a jolly Good fellow For he's a jolly Good fellow For he's a jolly Good fellow Which nobody can deny Here I am, Dad. You gave me a startle. You've been to the Putnams', haven't you? Why, I-- Did you see Matt? No, he wasn't home. Does he know what people are saying? He does know. Yes, he does. What did he say? I don't know. What did Miss Putnam say? Well, Marge, what difference does it make what anyone says? This is between you and Matt. What did she say? She said he was old enough to know his own mind. But I know Matt. He ain't gonna be swayed by a lot of gossip. He'll be here when he said he would. It ain't time yet. "Time," what is he waiting for? He could've come when he first heard it. He could've called me on the phone. Oh, here's Mr. Croft, now. Well, well, well, Mr. Putnam. Glad to meet you, sorry to have kept you waiting. Now, in just what way can we serve you? By okaying my account so that I can draw on it today and get out of here. Certainly, certainly. Be seated. It'll only take a moment for the necessary details. I hope so, or I'll have to let it go until tomorrow. Don't put off until tomorrow what you can do today, Putnam. Look, Mr. Croft, will you please sign that deposit slip? Yes, indeed. Yes, indeed. Now, don't you worry about the payroll. We'll take care of that. And we're mighty glad to have you here, Mr. Putnam. Thank you, may I use your phone, please? Yes, indeed. Yes, indeed. Rockridge. Nine-three, ring two. Busy, that's a party wire. Nine busy? Yeah. Would you care to wait? The operator will call you back. No, if my opinion of Rockridge is correct, I'll be able to drive over there before that line is open. That clock is always fast. Something might've happened, maybe. Stop, I can't stand it. He's never coming. I knew it this morning. Well, Marge, he'll be here. No, he won't. He won't ever be here. He believes it, all right. But it ain't true. What difference does that make in this town? They think it's true. And I've got to go on living with them for the rest of my life. Marge, don't talk like that. Why not? Everybody else can talk. I'm tired of keeping still and making believe I don't care. I do care. I never wanted anything in my whole life but this. And now it's gone just because somebody started a lie. Well, I hope it comes back to them someday. People who do things like this ought to be punished for it. I hope the person who started-- Marge! Get me Rockridge. Nine-three, ring two. Dad? Well, ring them again, please. Dad? Oh, Dad. Hello, Mr. Putnam! Did you hear what happened? What? Old Will Oliver shot himself. Marge, I'm sorry. You're a little late with your sympathy, aren't you? Marge, listen to me. I listened to you yesterday-- I've got to talk to you for a moment. There's nothing to talk about. If you'd kept your word, this wouldn't have happened. Aunt Nettie, I love her. I'm gonna stand by her. I've got to work this out in my own way. Give it time and it'll work itself out. Oh, no. There's only one language the people in this town speak. Six-eight, please. Mason? Matthew Putnam. How many Rockridge men do we employ on the dairy? About 300, sir. Well, I want them all discharged immediately and replaced with outside help. I don't understand, Mr. Putnam. That's all, Mason. You gone crazy? What are you trying to do now? Just trying to find out how fast news can really travel in this town. But look here, Nettie. We handled the Putnam accounts long before young Matthew was born. It's the Putnam accounts that had made the bank. Hmm. I have an idea that's why he transferred them. Miss Nettie? Do you know what it means to lay off all the Rockridge people and replace them with outsiders? Sure. Practically 300 men out of a job. It'll ruin Rockridge. There's a way of stopping it. He can't get away with this! Who says I can't? Well... I don't mean to butt in, Mr. Putnam, but I think you're going too far. Nettie, he's tearing this town wide apart, can't you do something with him? Maybe I can, if you two would get out and let me talk to him alone. Go on, scat, scat. All right, we're depending on you. But there's one thing you ought to know: News has already gone around... I wouldn't be surprised ...about the layoff at the dairy. And the men have called a mass meeting tonight at the City Hall. They're not going to take this thing sitting down. Can't get away with this, Matthew. You can't ruin a whole town just to satisfy your temper. Well, I seem to be doing it. You're going about it in the wrong way. You're making a lot of innocent people suffer with the guilty. It isn't the first time that's been done in this town. No one stopped to consider whether Marge Oliver was innocent or guilty. No one cared how much they made her father suffer. It won't work. I'll make it work. When I'm through with this town, you won't even be able to find it on the map. Well, Mason? Everything set? I had to turn it over to Johnson, he'll represent the men. Where is Johnson? Inside. All right, let's get going. Folks, I'm not much at speech-writing. But we've worked years for the Putnam Dairies. Most of us, all our lives. And we've never had any trouble. Now, this talk about laying off all the Rockridge men and replacing them by outsiders, if it is a case of a few men not doing good work, it would be different. Well, this looks to me like unjust discrimination. And when it comes to taking the food out of the mouths of our wives and children, I think that-- I think we're entitled to some kind of an explanation. All right, Mr. Johnson. You are entitled to an explanation. Ladies and gentlemen of Rockridge, in the 15 years the Putnam Dairy has belonged to me, it has not been run for my personal profit. It has been run for the benefit of all. But it has failed. Rockridge has not appreciated the Putnam efforts on its behalf. That's not a fair thing to say, Mr. Putnam. Are you looking for fairness, Mr. Sherman? If so, I might ask you a few personal questions. I'm sorry, I-- I didn't mean to interrupt. Hello, Ma. They're going to it hot and heavy down here. Johnson was spreading it on thick, when who should walk in but Matt Putnam himself? And if Matt don't watch his step, there's liable to be a lynching in this town yet. Save me a seat, Bert, I'll be right over. Deborah. Deborah. Joe! Come here. Deborah, where are you? What are you waiting for? Joe! Deborah! Well, I hope the house ain't on fire! Well? What are you gawking at? Come on, get moving! Joe, get that wheelchair down out of the attic. Deborah, get me some clothes. Clothes, Miss Nettie? What kind of clothes? Just clothes, you idiot. A dress, petticoat, shoes, stockings, hat, gloves-- Nevermind the gloves. What do you want clothes for? Because I can't go down to the meeting in my nightgown, can I? You can't go out! You haven't been out of your bed in 15 years. I may not be out in another 15 years. But tonight's my night to howl! Get me some clothes! I'll tell you, Putnam, you can't get away with it. Are you trying to tell me what I can't do with my own property? Did I miss anything? No. No, I'm telling you what you can't do with us. You can't take your spite out on all of us, just to get back at a few people that you think have done you dirt. Hold everything! He's right, Matthew, let me handle this. I know these people better than you do. Well, come on! Put me up in that pulpit if I've got to make a speech. What does she know about it? Sit down, Johnson- I'll handle this. and you, too, T.P. You've been doing a lot of talking and getting no place. Wasting the taxpayers' money on electricity. This nonsense has gone far enough. In some ways, my nephew's right, and in some ways, he's wrong. Let's look at facts in the face. This never would've happened if we didn't have a lot of women in this town who had nothing better to do than glue their ears to a telephone. Mathilda Sherman is the social bellcow of this town. And what she says, you all follow up with like a flock of sheep. Wouldn't have been so bad, Mathilda, if you'd gone to the trouble of finding out what Will Oliver was really talking about. Just a little misunderstanding about some bookkeeping. But you couldn't wait to spread the news. And you put the worst interpretation on it that you could. A shotgun meant only one thing to you: A wedding. And if Mathilda really wanted something to talk about, she wouldn't have to go outside of her own home. I resent that, Nettie. Sit down, T.P., I'll get to you in a minute. The only reason you're waving the banner for the working men is because it affects your business. No pay envelopes, no bank deposits. That's the axe you have to grind. And when you handle those stocks and bonds for old Mrs. Jenkins, you come out all right, too. You've got a $10.000 house to live in. And Mrs. Jenkins is taking in washing. What are you giggling about, Clara West? You live in a glass house, too. By the way, what ever became of that fertilizer salesman from Kansas City? You'll be laughing out of the other side of your face, Lem Davis, when I get through with you. You put on a big campaign in your newspaper about this very building. "Rockridge needs a new town hall." First time it's been used since we built it. How about it, Lem? That's all right, Grandma Kern, you and Paul can go on home, now. I don't have to tell them that, during the 14-year dry spell we had, you were making gin in the bathtub and Paul was delivering it at night. Because everybody in town knows it anyway. 'Tweren't gin, 'twas applejack! Don't forget Bert West. I was saving him. And now, we come to the village casanova. Or as he calls himself, a local hot potato, Bert West. Bert's asked every woman under 50 to drive over to Waysville with him. And I could name every one of the young ladies, and some not so young, who have taken a little trip with him. I did not. What are you squirming about, Irene? Conscience hurt you? I wasn't even gonna mention your name. I was just going to add that when the road to Waysville was under repair, Bert knows a shortcut 'round to the ice house. Some fun, huh? The next time any of us feel like listening in on other people's business, and passing along any gossip, let's stop and think of poor old Will Oliver. Meeting's adjourned! Quiet! That was wonderful, Aunt Nettie. Thanks a million. Shucks. You ought to hear me when I really get wound up. This may not be as nice as Marge's cake, but knowing how you like angel food... Thanks, Mathilda, that's mighty nice of you. I'll put it in the bread box for you, where it'll keep nice and fresh. Didn't know you were so popular, did you, Will? Doesn't he look good today? He's getting color back in his cheeks again. Soon as I'm feeling better, I'm gonna finish painting that barn. Ain't you glad you weren't such a good shot? Sure I am. It don't surprise me none. I never could do the little things right. No wonder I bungled a big job when I had it. Where's Marge today? Oh, she's gone over to Springfield to get a new dress or something. Well, I must be going. I'm expecting a very important phone call. Goodbye! Yes, I'll have to go, too. Well, I've got to get down to the office. Mrs. Putnam, we certainly put one over on Rockridge. What a shame. Where would you like to spend your honeymoon? Asia. Niagara Falls is mighty pretty in June. Too close to home. How about Africa? I said Niagara Falls. Nothing closer than Europe, or I'll get a divorce. You come back here. Putnam, your training's gonna begin right now. When I say "Niagara Falls," it is Niagara Falls, or else! You big bully! Don't you strike me. Rockridge, nine-three, ring one-two. Hello? Hello, Ma! They're married, all right. But no sooner than got out of the courthouse, they got in a fight. She called him a big bully, and he almost took a sock at her! Yeah.
