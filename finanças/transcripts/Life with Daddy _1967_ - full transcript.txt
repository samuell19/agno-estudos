Father makes the sauce in his kitchen and that's happiness when the steak is cooked to a crisp father makes the sauce, the potatoes are like ice cream go and eat mom, she has a job the gag was turned up a darn lot daddy takes his turn puzzles about the family's naughty kids taking care of the children is his great desire, but he is only a man He can't breastfeed father is making the sauce, it will be better and one must honor him every time it happens that someone asks for more father makes the sauce, the food is lovely today, good luck and taste father has finally learned what was so terribly difficult now the child plus mother can thank father in a splendidly mixed chorus taking care of the children is his great desire, but he is only a man he really can't give a breast! (he whistles) (she hums) (she starts the vacuum cleaner) (she hums) (he whistles) (he snores) (she squeals) Herbert, wake up! Someone was screaming. No, it was down the road. - Oh. Catch it! Where is it? I keep being scared. Help... Tobias... Tobias, in place! - Catch it then, Lasse! Not so loud, it gets scared. - Lasse, ladies don't like mice! (loud squeal) Herbert... there it was again! No, it comes from down the road. Now lie down, it's morning soon. (she screams and falls down) That didn't come from down the road! - It might be a thief. You have to check! I wonder if it came from the road, after all? - You are the man of the house! Good morning, Mrs. Joergensen. - (alarm clock rings) Goodbye! She left. - Nah, Mrs. Joergensen! They must not leave us! - Think about it, Mrs. Joergensen! That won't happen anymore, Mrs. Joergensen! What will become of us? Mrs Joergensen! - Mrs. Joergensen... What now? Coffee. We don't make it, never. She could have done something for the rest of us. How again? Good, we got rid of the sour onion, right dad? Poor child! What will become of you and of us all? You talk like I'm 5 years old. - So are you. Yes, but still. Mother, shouldn't I stay home from school and look after Lasse? No, you shouldn't... Yes, you should, because I'm so busy. Now it must be my turn! - Herbert, you must find a new one. Housekeeper. It is impossible. - What else should I do? It's not your problem alone. I will probably help you with... Shall we send some flowers? - No, that doesn't help. She wouldn't come if we sent a flower shop! Tobias? ... There is no water in the boiler. Good... As long as you have canned food, you can easily manage it. There is a lot of beetroot in the kitchen. - Fine, Lasse. It's no problem to cook, right? Smoke! Watch out, it burns! Be careful it doesn't blow! - Roll up the windows! Why is there no water in the boiler? It is yourself! When will the fire trucks come? - Dad, there's a hole in the kettle! Then it is better to put water in. - It takes a long time before it is full. What would you rather have on? - Italian salad. Herbert, hurry up! italian salad... Where has she done with it? - We have no more. You asked what I wanted most! Aah, the rotten mouse! - What are you doing? Nothing. - Good, my boy. Haven't you seen dad's folder? Myriads of light shatter against the universe's wall... No. Myriads of light are scattered towards the wall of the universe. (car horn) Herbert, hurry! - Yes, yes, now I'm coming. What are you about to do? - I'm hungry. Trille, you are in command until I get home from school, don't blow up the house. Behave properly. Clean up after yourselves. Goodbye. I don't want to see your toys floating all over the house! Good morning, Mr. Principal. They call in early. Here, the call is never too early... or too late. We have to set a good example for the students, right? Decided. Precision is what I preach on time...and untimely. Good morning, girls. Sit down... The enemy is listening. (loud squeal) (their squealing stops) You are welcome to try new teaching methods. But if you want to listen to an experienced educator, you are on the wrong track. Ugh...! Ugh...! Good morning, Mrs. Nielsen. - Good morning, Carlsen. (ringing) - Yes? Thanks. Good morning, Joergensen. - Good morning, Mrs. Ingeneer. Who set it up? The chairman of the board said that I should not interfere. Yes, good morning. Aunt Karla, I hope you haven't been waiting. Nonsense and humbug. Sit down. Have you considered becoming a director of the company here? Me?! No! - Then who? You. - Me? ... It's terrible. You haven't driven the factory since Oskar died? Don't know everything there is to know about ties? Then you get a name that you do good. It's wonderful, Aunt Karla, but Mrs. Joergensen has left us. Aren't you married to a school teacher with 3-4 hours so called of work a day? You let him take his hands out of his pockets. You must not sacrifice your career, a career worthy of a woman. Aunt Dorit and I will make suggestions about it tomorrow. I have 78,000 in shares, and with Aunt Dorit's 62 it becomes... 62, 63, 64, 65... - Yes, 140,000. Exactly, 140,000 crowns. Should the board vote against, - then they cannot knock it. Well, my girl, I must run. I'm going to inaugurate a nursery. - Am I man enough to handle it? No! But you're woman for it. See you again, director Nielsen. Your secretary... is he up to anything? Yes, he is skilled and pleasant. Why? Why let a man do what a woman can do. Fine, anyone can type on a typewriter. Whoa... Whoa... Are you standing there? Hi. Listen right here: Myriads of light splinter against the universe's wall... It's terrible! - Reeally. What about: Myriads of light sensually embrace misty globes... I forgot. Aunt Karla and Aunt Dorit can come at any moment. Where's the kids? At William's. The dust beams of the hydrogen storms. Are aunties 1 and 2 coming? - Herbert, I will be director. Manager? - Yes. What do you say? You?! - Why do you say it like that? Should my little wife be a director? - Yes. What about us at home? Your children and me? Nah, that's not a good idea, is it? - It comes as a bit of a surprise. You don't mind it? - No. That makes a lot of money, doesn't it? - It could well be. Herbert, at my age! - It's a nice age. You are lovely! - No, you're lovely. Are they coming to dinner? Yes, why not? It is probably a control visit. What have you bought? It's a hat. I couldn't resist it. What did you pay for it? - It is practical. You can do... like this... We will have dinner guests. Should they eat the hat? I forgot that Mrs. Joergensen... I'm not used to handling it! Now the shops are closed. We also have to change clothes. ... We can't serve sausages for the board! Why not? Can't you do something, like shine them up? - I didn't know that. Hey, mom! We were over at Vivian's. Have you been amused and sweet? - Yes. Lasse dug up earthworms and put them into the shower tub. Look, there's a taxi coming to us! Herbert, you must accept. Remember to tie your ribbon. Don't we have a can opener? - Yeah. (the doorbell rings) I put on another dress. Meanwhile, I look in the cookbook. Herbert, you ribbon! Nah... good day! - Good day. That's cozy. No, that's way too much. - From flower to flower. Like boss to boss. Yes, Bitten probably doesn't get too many flowers. Now I have to... oops. The space is tight. Where there is room for the heart, there is room for the house. Ouch! Then I'd rather do it myself. - Nice weather. Yes, you have time to enjoy it. And there we have the adorable children. Give Aunt Dorit a kiss. I don't kiss! - Aah, so manly, already. Adorable. It was a long time ago. Bitten had something she needed to fix. Yes, she has no help. Let me see... sausages. Where is the delightful... grandmother's chest of drawers. And Oskar's Bornholmer. - And your tin terrine. And the dresdner porcelain. - And so blank. Yes, orderliness is a good sign. What Bitten can overcome! And not the hint of food-scent. You wouldn't think she was expecting guests. Here is the poet's cave. Aah, the blue flower of poetry. Pegasus soars on a golden cloud! - Yes... Pretend you are at home. I'm just going... to the kitchen net. I think you should. ... Male people. He is talented. But I prefer the nature lyric. Lazy, sloppy and reactionary. Did you see his tie? You can say things so clearly, sister Karla. There is not a word about sausages! Can't they eat an old fashioned Danish sausage? - They must make a good impression. If only I had a little help. - Help?! Come in and say hello. Now dad has to make the sauce. You...?! Aunt Karla cooks amazing food herself. They will have exciting food, I promise you like the hair stands up. Put on one of Aunt Karla's ties. - No. Yes. Pour them a few drinks. - They don't touch liquor. You're coming soon, aren't you? - When the food is ready. Out! (Trille plays 'Miss Toben') Well done. What are you going to be when you grow up? I'm getting married. - I guess you should order something. Yes, I will have 5 children and maybe a son. - Enchanting! She is not one of your disciples. - They say so much. Whoa...! Were you scared? Lasse, will you then put it away! You weren't startled, were you? No trace. I was just about to die! And on a fasting heart. Now we're also going to... I just have to go out and look for the food. Want to see the one we have from Africa? - Nah thanks, I've seen enough. Well, maybe... Then it just has to be flamb√©ed. Whiskey. Is there alcohol in it? - We do not enjoy alcoholic beverages at all. This is quite harmless. Almost a kind of applesauce. Cheers and a very warm welcome. What did you say it was? - It must be very strong cider. The apples may have fermented a little too much. Doesn't it smell like alcohol? - No, I can't believe that. I have never tasted such a nice apple cider. Then he went out to the picture garden and dreams so sweetly of his usual maar... If you get used to it... - Yes, you have to get used to it. We serve something similar for the children's birthday. May I taste, father? - No! Go out into the kitchen. I want to thank you for that trust, - which you will show Bitten in the future. She is adorable! - Nonsense! Bitten is an independent woman who does not have to serve for her husband. Cheers. I am sure you have chosen the right man... woman. Cheers. Yes, it's served. Doesn't it taste a bit... - Pretty strong? Yes, it is about right. - 'Pretty much?' Isn't that a flat compliment to a woman, - who has a responsible job, looks after food and does the housework? Herbert, just mean... - It's an excellent food. Well done my girl. - It is wonderful. It tastes a bit erotic... - Exotic! It is a Chinese dish. - It's called Sumisakaluniki-san. God, how funny! Susimis... pulimu... Sumikaluniki-san. It is Japanese. I know it. Whatever you can do, my girl. Could I have a glass of... And then completely without help. - Bitten has help. We had no idea. Who? She has me. - Yes, dear Herbert. Is there anything so wonderful as when two people have each other! I don't mean just physically, but spiritually. Because two who love each other can heal each other's hair. As he writes... Vikkenberg. - Stuckenberg. Yes, Stikko-vukkenberg... What? I can't say the hardest word. Oh, cheers you two. I want some of what the others are eating. You won't get that. It's too boozy, says dad. It's a worse kindergarten. A leaf... a small green leaf... A tiny little green leaf that unfolds and waves in the wind. Herbert, don't you think it's tra... What was life without green leaves? The juice of life. And not least we women... Ha-ha... we women... No, that's not what I wanted to talk about... I wonder what I will see. - No, it's not that one at all. I wonder if Bitten hasn't got something bad in the food. As for the juice here, there is nothing wrong with it. You'll have to ask Herbert about that. He made the sauce. The gravy. Good night. - Good night. Sleep well. Now I'm down. - Good night. There's nothing in the coffee, is there? - It's probably not necessary. Coffee's ready. Lovely Andalusian mountain mocha... Ah, my head... - Only it's not the flu. Are we going home already? We had such an enchanting time. Don't want them if they vomit? It's just the flu. - It smells suspicious. They must not stand and drive it off. They must help with the dishes. Because Bitten is a woman of progress and... No, no, no. No working now, it's 11.30. It's off work. - Not for a soon-to-be-director... I hope. 'Hope?' Aunt Karla was very happy. Wait until she sobers up. Herbert, we must have help. If I go to school and get hold of a cleaning lady. Maybe one of them will earn a little. - Nice, you can fix everything. Yes, I am the man of the house. - What about the dishes? Yes... I can do that. Good morning. - Good morning. (he coughs) Good morning. What do they want? - I am a teacher, my name is Nielsen. Do you want to teach us something? - No, I wanted to ask about something. If you have time? Aah... about forgiveness. I am pleased to meet you, madam... Rottschild. - Rottschild? It was amusing. Why? - Well, no... of course. The thing is... I have an old house, comfortably furnished. 2 children, lovely children... And so it is that I come to you, madam... Rottschild? - That's sweet of you. But I do not accept marriage proposals during working hours. Also, I'm married. Good morning. Wait! They must not go. Our house help has left. Poor you, it's mine too. I managed it all by myself for 2 years. What can we do? - Give it up. It's hopeless. Mrs. Rottschild.... how about a little extra shilling? Mr. Nielsen, money is not everything. I do not like that! - It doesn't taste like it used to. That beer bread tastes exactly ... as beer bread should taste, I made it from the cook book. (honks) - I have to go now. Why can't I go to school? - Someone have to look after Lasse. You're not usually so eager. - You have to think about your future. Where is father? - Looking for a lady. (it rings) God! Master Jacob, master Jacob are you sleeping don't you hear the bell don't you hear the bell boom boom boom boom boom boom... Thanks! Good morning, Principal. Really hearty... precision. I would like to recommend that we put... With your permission, I'd rather sit. My head... There is a lot of flu at the moment. I propose that we put the Bitten Nielsen case to a vote. In reality it is unnecessary. - Unnecessary, Madam President? My 78,000 and my sister's shares of 62,000... It will be... 62, 63, 64... 140,000, yes. They have the majority of the shares. Perhaps we should discuss whether there are other options. Without doubting your niece's qualifications. Yes, she's ravishing... - Shot your trap, Dorit. Who would it be? - Your nephew. Jussi?! He's a fool. Jussi... can you do it? It's a conspiracy! You are missing in the salesroom. - Well! Those who vote for raise their hands. And the election votes for. The proposal was unanimously adopted. I thought so. Manager... Congratulations. - Don't look so angry, Jussi. If you sold what I produced, it was your. Not with Aunt Karla. Because I have a terrible, tiny little bug. I am a man! And with the ties you produce, - there is a difficulty: the customers must be color blind! It doesn't get any better when Aunt Karla has to draw every little piece of cloth. Yes, I have to redo it. You will become wiser! Bitten, what about Herbert and your children? (loud music) Hello? Lisa... Lisa... (music stops) - Good day, miss. Mortensen. What is this? - The Rolling Stones. Why are you not in school? I look after the house and children. - Whoa! Good day, little friend. - Weren't you scared? Where is your mother? - On the office. She is a director. - So where is your father? He is looking for a lady. Mr. Nielsen, there's a phone! Yes, hello? Hi, little darling. Congratulations, congratulations, baby... Yes, what should I buy? No, not sausages! Wait, I have to write up. I just need a pencil... Oh, thank you, thank you very much. Yes, then I'm ready. 2 pounds of stuffing for meatballs. Are you able to do it? Well, the cookbook. Potatoes. And so on... What is it? Is it 2 half lobsters, or for 50 cents liver patej? Oh yeah. I'll figure something out. Bye for now. Oh, thank you. - Has your wife fallen ill? No, she has become a director. How much does the mutton cost? - 9.85, ma'am. And the nape? - 6.85. There is high rope, DKK 20 per half kilo. - No, so 2 sirloins. What would it be? - 1 piece of inner comb. Tender comb? - Uh... lean high heeled beef with cooking fat. Don't you have a note with you? - Oh... it must be something good. What will it be used for? - Meat... They know. For beef b√©arnaise for example. Nice thick yellow b√©arnaise sauce. Should it be well-cured meat? - Well hung? Be sweet and make up your own mind. Give me 15 sausages... Those who red, those there. Yes, those ones. 7.50. Here you go. - Are the sausages ready to eat? They must be boiled, Mr. In quite ordinary water. You could also fry them... on a frying pan. In quite ordinary water? - No, in butter. Now it must be my turn. There are cookbooks, after all. Ugh! You must apologize for that! - Is it them? What a mess. The sausages are mine. Is that yours? No. The lemons are yours. - No, isn't it yours? I dont think so... No... whoop! Shouldn't we just pick it up and distribute it at my place? Has your wife fallen ill? - No, she has become a director. Manager? Aah, poor you. - It's not that bad. How much flour do you need? - A cupful. Gustav is also a director. It is strict work, says Gustav. The food must be on the table on time. Your wife has a great head! Nah... And then it just has to be stirred around. Not too fast. Imagine that you can cook like that! It actually amuses me. Well, I have to go over to myself. Hi, Gustav. - Thanks for the description. No, no, I'm a shame alone. Sniff! What have? - The Canary! It flew out! It is Gustav's everything! Do not worry. I can handle that. Hard work, huh? - Was there anything you wanted? We're just wondering what you're doing. I catch canaries. How many can you catch on average per day? I have it, Mr. Nielsen. It flew in by itself. Here it is! - That's good, Trille. Then we put it here, and then we write the recipe up for mother. Uhm, it's going to be an all-time showdown. May I taste? - No, it's not for eating! So why does it have to be written up? Hello? Hey, mom! - Hi. What kind of wagon is that? - It's Ms. Mortensen. Dad says we should stay outside and play. Don't misunderstand my intentions, they are idealistic... ... consideration for the children. We can probably meet there. After all, we are colleagues, even if you are the well-known poet. A bit of a bohemian... But I understand you, I'm unmarried... miss. Good day. - Hi, my friend. It's my wife. Herbert, your apron. It's Trille's teacher. And that's my wife, director Nielsen. Is there something wrong? - I wanted to ask about that. There must be a reason why Lise neglects school. It's the girl's future that matters. - It concerns 2 silly days. You should not look so lightly on your daughter's education as a strong woman. There is smoke in the kitchen, daddy. - Good. Plug out and play. If it's so important, you had better teach the children something! She don't even know the... The Danish school today is ... solely character-forming. You too? If you just teach them something, I'll take it character-building! Should the children be exempt from the material goods? Are you not self-acquiring? Yes, but I am not responsible for the child's upbringing! Now let's see clearly... - It's wasted on me. The influence of the environment on the child's development is a fact. The home and the well-being of the residents are more important than the car and the electric stove! Herbert, it's burning! What kind of menagerie is this? I'll advice you... (she coughs) I'm suffocating! - My lovely food! Now you must listen to me! I'm not leaving this house until... (cough) Aw, did he beaten you? - Ouch, poor child! We have to eat out. - We can't afford that. Now you must be orderly, otherwise there will be a strike. Then I decide where. - And I what. You are allowed to eat out. Does it taste good, my little friend? - Yes, why not! It's the best food I had in days! Aren't we supposed to eat here every day, man? Yes, Dad loves to eat out. - No, better not to. Good night. - Good night. Good night. - Good night. Good night. - Good night. Good night. - I'm down. Herbert... Don't clean up all the time. - Yes, if you don't make a mess all the time. Maybe she was right... Do you think we are neglecting them? Aren't we too away? Too busy. - I'm never away. It's probably wrong that we both have careers outside the home. Do you mean it? - Yes. Have you figured it out? - Yes. Do you think you can handle it? Should I stay at home? - Wasn't that what you were talking about? You always complained that you had so much to do. Not at my work I'm worn out! Yours? What about mine? You have your poems... - I can't make a living from that. No one can live from that. My poems are published in 200 copies. Free copies. I'm not going to be a midwife! Shall we break up? - How do you come up with that idea? Why aren't you sleeping? - You shout so loudly. It is worst for the divorce kids. - Yes, you can go to bed now. I want to go to school again tomorrow. - Of course. Good night. Close the door behind you. What is it? You mustn't cry, I can't stand it. I should never have started at the factory. You said that too. I never said that. Now wipe your eyes. You are also right. You don't have to wait, we'll get it like now... with a house and a car. I also earn some money... I displeased my pocket scarf. - I never learned anything. I can't make it as nice here as you can. You are good at making it cozy. I'll have to make an effort. If only I could learn how to cook. An intelligent person with an exam can easily boil potatoes and make a meatball. No! - Now, look here. I will. It is also more natural for the man to pursue a career. Yes, why exactly? Now I make a good cup of coffee. No, Herbert, I will! (the water is boiling) Maybe you could become a lecturer in time? - Lecturer? Or perhaps the principal? - You are sweet. Now I have to. - No, I can! No, you can't and you shouldn't! Well, the children and the home... - It's also my home. All that nonsense that a woman's place is in the home! A woman like you... You can't have everything. - You cannot do without your ties, I can. I quit school! - It's your job! You continue as director, and I am a stay-at-home dad. Father makes the gravy with the dust and he has tried to clean up some toys father makes the sauce, small pancakes with beer, go ahead and rinse father has washed up the pot, plate, cup and saucer then he stands and looks sourly at knives and forks and dirty spoons taking care of the children is his great desire but he's only a man he can't give a breast father makes the sauce it gets better one must honor him every time it happens that someone asks for more father makes the gravy the food is lovely today here you go and taste father has finally learned what was so terribly difficult now the child plus mother can thank father in a splendidly mixed chorus taking care of the children is his great desire but he is only a man... It's a complete lie. Stick me with the binoculars. Quick, Martha. What is he doing? - He looks after the house. He must also order something. Whoa, whoa! It's sickening. The wife has obviously run away. No, she has become a director. Yes, she's always been a cold cigar... Pick it up, Martha. You got it, mate! - That was a proper mop boy! Was it an ostrich? That's a bit too much, Mr. No, I do not think so. ... What have? There is a little over. Does it do anything? - Yes exact, then I can't figure it out It will be 15.44. Here you go. - They don't have 44 cents, do they? I have 50 cents. - I have 10 cents. Do you have 4 cents? I have 5 cents. Then you can give me 1 cent. I have 2 cents. Do you have 1 cent? I have 10 cents. Give me 9 cents again. Will this last long? - It's not the Danmark's Nationalbank. Does it help if I exchange a 25-cents? There are only 22 cents! - Then owe 3 cents. No thanks, young man, I'll pay everyone's share. Can someone exchange a 10-cent? - I guess I can. No, I only have 8 cents. - Then you owe me 2 cents. I only have my pension. Here you go, here it is. I have something cooking at home. How much do I owe? - I owe you 9 cents. No, 3 cents. - I owe you 3 cents. I owe 2 cents. - No, I gave them so it could end. No, don't worry, you get 5 cents from me, and then you give me 3 cents back. But I only have the 2. - Then let me have them. 2 is enough. Jussi? That was a surprise. - The door was open. Is there anything I can offer you? - You look tired, Herbert. I am not. I'm just a bit busy. Excuse me. The director is not coming for the time being. She has gone to the airport. The airport? - To fetch Monsieur Dupont. Monsieur Dupont... Frenchman. - Move a little. Are you drunk? Just read it here. - Yes. Yes. I'm depressed. 'You whip 7 egg yolks...' You look very tired. - Spring breeding. I have it figured out. What is that Frenchman going to do? - Draw a tie. He is the Dior of ties. When Aunt Karla finds out, she goes into overdrive. How does it feel? To be on it... be a member of the rowdy hands club? What more? - Women's Affairs man. No, in the book! Oil, flour, rice... Jussi, why don't you get married? - Nah, the tracks are scaring. I let my kind die out. Nobody wants you. - They all want me! Dad! Dad, we're hungry! Hold here. - I'm not helping you. Look and get started or also leave, don't have time to play with you today. If it had been you, I wouldn't have gone here. You have no ambitions! What about your ambitions? Stay home housewife! Whoa, housefather - Was that what you dreamed of? Bitten and I are fine. Yes, Bitten is fine, but what about you? Isn't it time you hit the table and say to Bitten: 'Then it's over. Come home to your house and be a woman!' So you can become a director? - So! It's for your own sake. Herbert, Herbert! You are badly attacked, Herbert. - Look at your tie! It's Aunt Karla's. Serves her right! It is against the order of nature. Bitten is a gorgeous woman. She has more sex in her little finger than both Brigitte and Bardot. I've been to a bar with her. - With Bitten? With Bardot. But inside, an ice tap with a light in it. Bardot? - Nah, Bitten. It must be said, before you sink into apathetic lethargy, - before your poet's spirit gets bogged down in house fims and washing-up water. Hit the table, Herbert! Do something! - Okay. Orv, man, he's wearing clothes, he'll be soaked. - Is it for real, man? We're joking. Call for a cart. Uncle Jussi is tired of playing. Heyy! - Wasn't it Uncle Jussi? Yes, he was half-witted. - He was soaking wet. Half-plowed? - He was drunk. Where is father? - He's in there. Hi, honey. - Hi. Why are you wearing sunglasses? - I peel onion. I never have that. - You never peel onions. What did Jussi want? - Gossip about Bitten... and the daughter. I am going to a meeting. Aren't we going to eat soon? Who are you going to meet? - A business connection. Why is the typewriter in the kitchen? I write down my experiences to know what not to do. You should go on a housekeeping course! No! We'll be the laughing stock of the whole town! I want to be a chef, but no one knows! You should be the last to underestimate the work of a housewife. You don't have to be a taught to peel onions or make sauce. Go ahead, try it! - Herbert, I have to get dressed... Housekeeping is a subject. It must be learned from the ground up. In addition to the practical, we have the theory subjects: Budgeting, nutrition teachers, housing teachers and childcare. During daily work, we use wash gowns. Students must bring aprons or smocks, - 1 cape and 2 pot holders. How old is your daughter? My daughter? 8 years. - 8 years? Nah, such young ladies ... it probably won't work. That's not my daughter. - Is that your wife? No, it's not at all... - Oh, who is it then? It is me. - (her pearl necklace breaks) Vitamins are organic substances that are necessary for nutrition, - and which has a great influence on the course of life processes. Let's look at vitamin A first. It is important for the mucous membranes' resistance to infections. Achoo! For eexample colds. - God bless you. (he coughs) - Father! What is it? You mustn't make noise like that when you have a cold. I want to go out and play Batman. No, you have to settle for reading about Batman! No, I have read the stupid paper! Be proper, or I'll tell mother. Batman is very tough! Be quiet. Father is a poet. - Poet? Bah! Do you want to be the father or the mother? The mother! I come home and say: 'I've had a strict day. Is the food not ready?' What does the father say? 'What if you took care of Lasse and didn't waste time with allegories?' He's good at foreign words, isn't he? (dough rumbles) (the doorbell rings) Good day, Mrs Stormann. Do you want to go inside? Is Vivian here? Her acting teacher is waiting. Trille, come down. Vivian is going to the game. (a rumble) God, what is that? - The balloon cake stands and rises. Isn't there too much... - Balloon? We are a big family. It disappears like dew before the sun. (the phone is ringing) Hello? Howdy, little darling. Yes, we are fine. No, Mrs. Stormann, you must not go! Who are you talking to? Well. How is it going with Lasse? Yeah...at 7 o'clock, right, honey? I have to run. Goodbye. From Paris. I guess it's Dupont's sketches. You must have made an impression on him. Shouldn't I take care of them? Herbert is proper, but won't he take a look, - when you come home with red roses? The door was open. Am I disturbing you? New wife? - Well, no, that... we have... It's my publisher. Mrs. Stormann, my neighbor. I am Horekaer. - you too. Well, no... I guess I have to go in. - Now I have to, Mrs. Stormann. Neighbor... - You read too much porn. But nature is something else, isn't it? What do you look like? Isn't that a bit eccentric dressing? You look like a performance of 'The Male House Assistant.' Shall I make a cup of coffee? - Oh, she has gone home to her mother? No! But I will soon. - You quit school. So I can find time to write. Must be weird, huh? To be provided for. There's money in porn, Herbert. Also to the author. You probably couldn't, almost for fun, as an experiment... No, you couldn't. Do you want me to write porn? Forget it. How is it going? - Yes... it will work. We will issue your next collection of poems as a magnificent edition. With golden ratio, big costs, nice reviews, no sales. For the sake of the tax authorities. There is too much profit this year. It gives too well, the second. They're tearing me. Now you can concentrate without wasting time on a thousand other things. Yeah...yeah, that's nice. What is this? 'The Widow Graes Cookbook.' These are food recipes. I do this for fun. Shouldn't I rewrite the poems? I made one the other day... Listen to this. Dad, who's there? - Quietly! I don't want to hear a sound! The sky wheels turn in the light clockwork of the clouds Streaks of sunlight go like pointers over the landscape measuring the time of year out measuring the age of the Earth until they stop abruptly at human sparing rings the hands coolly go on measuring the age of the Earth the wheels of heaven turn in the sad clockwork of the clouds. What do you say? - What do you say? What do you say... to the poem? - Brilliant. I look at this, it tells me something. Shouldn't I rewrite it? - No, leave it to me. Everything has turned for the better. And say hello to your lovely wife. Say hello to your lovely wife, he said. - The crown? It falls. No, he said: Greet your lovely wife. Oh... thanks, he's sweet. I can't forget you bringing roses home to me. It's nothing special. Not many people take flowers home to their men. A splendid edition with gold cut... (clap) You sit and laugh so silly, Herbert. It was something I came to think of with bay... leaves. Woop... dong... Herbert, what are you reading? It's Batman. I look at the pictures. It's pop art. Comics, recipes and gossip. Take care that you do not sink into spiritual idleness. Idle time... Then we cut the catfish's head off. Remove the fins, starting at the tail. Go ahead and begin. Get to it, Nielsen. - Isn't that pretty brutal? Such is life. Now grab it. A quick cut. It is not dead. It stirs. - Much better. So it's fresh, isn't it? We never eat fish at our place. - Nielsen, show yourself like a man. Well done! Then we powder the tail thoroughly. Like that, yes. They are quick learner, Nielsen. If you continue like this, it will end with you also being able to give birth to the child! 1... 2, cross, cross, cross. And swing... forward. Swing it again like a bottle of champagne. Well...swing, swing. Yes, that's good, yes. 1, 2, 3, 4... ... 5, 6, 7. And finally we count together. Then it should agree with the cash inventory. This is keeping a household account. Something else is about getting the money to work. (machine alarm) Good day... May I speak to the director? Do you have an appointment? - No, I have not. What is the name? - Nielsen, Herbert Nielsen. Would that suit you on Tuesday at 10? I had to talk to her now. What is it about? I'm the director's wife... uh... She's... We're married, coincidentally. Really? - Yes, really. Joergensen, look for the work slips. Yes, just a moment, Putte. What did you say, Joergensen? Here you go! - Herbert! What will you? These are the work sheets. Does he sit on the lap when you dictate? Not sure I like you bothering me at work. Where are the children? - They look after each other. I wouldn't take your time if we weren't in a liquidity crisis. You got money the other day. - In last week. Everything goes up. Do you think this is a million business. How much do you need? There is laundry, it is DKK 45. Then there is the shopkeeper at 62.75. Joergensen, write me a private check for 200 crowns. Yes... Mr. Dupont is waiting in the showroom. I come now. I have to go now. I do not want to talk to you. I come home late. It is clear, Mr. Director. - You are an ass. Here you go, here is... Thanks. Now there is coverage, right? Come on! Herbert! Is it you? - What's the point? I thought it was someone who had sneaked in. You have to be very careful about fashion spies... What do you say? Is there anyone here as tough as dad? Yeah, Batman, right? - Why do we have to eat so well? It's father's and mother's wedding day. Was I there at the wedding? - No. You were born long after... 4 months after. Do you get some presents? - No, but you have to give presents. Dad bought them for you. - What did mother say when she proposed? Why do you think, mother proposed? - Isn't she just the type? (the phone is ringing) Yes? ... Hi, honey. Where are you? When are you coming? Well... No, it would have been nice if you came on time. No, no, no particular reason. Yes... Yes, yes. Bye for now. Hi. I had to say hello from Aunt Karla. There is an extra-ordinary board meeting tomorrow. She seemed quite chilly. - Yes, I have driven it my way. Ah... excusez-moi... How did it taste? - Why doesn't she come home? I don't go to bed until mother comes home. We must give gifts. When you have such a talented mother, she can't always be on time. It's our wedding day. - Now go up and wash your hands. (the doorbell rings) - It's mother! Stay here! Today I want to be allowed to close up myself. Father, in apron! Ha-ha-ha. Hi, dear... Mrs. Stormann! I thought it was my wife. - It does not matter. Saw the car was gone. Do you have a few aspirin? - Yes, come inside. I will not disturb. - What do you have neighbors for? Are you bad? - Nothing special. Come in, Mrs. Stormann. It wasn't mom. Go up and brush teeth. Can I get up now, father will be here in a little while. Are you also alone? - Yes, Gustav is not coming. I have had the food ready for several hours. Look there. And we have a wedding day. - God, what a shame. I guess that's what it's like to be a home going. ... ou bien dans ce genre o soie naturelle? Trust the bee. Jussi, it's salted almonds! What? Can't we have something brought here? Oh... can't you book a table where it goes quickly? Call Herbert and tell him I'm sorry. Nous parlions d'aller manger. - Many? Ah qui, volunteers. (the phone rings) - Yes, it's Slipsco. Dav, Herbert. Yes, it's Jussi. Bitten? Nah...she's not here. Well, you didn't know that? She is out with Dupont. Yeah, you gotta get used to that, old boy. Yes, they are down at the Flamingo Bar. Yes, he is a nice person. Yes, he is French after all... Mrs. Stormann... do you like roasted turkey? A little bit more? - No, Nielsen, you are a genius! Think if Gustav was like you? I'm glad you like it. Cheers. I haven't eaten so well since we were on our honeymoon in Paris. I just thought you were happy again. When he comes home late, he brings roses. It is not all wives... all men who are so grateful. I know what those roses mean! - Really? Sorry, I'm intruding. You have your own problems. Really? At least they have nothing to worry about. A beautiful woman, like you. - They try to comfort me. No, I mean it. - Do they? (fierce honk) It was Gustav! Did you hear that? He honked! He honked right! - Doesn't he usually do that? I know Gustav, so he doesn't bring roses to my house. How do i look? - Radiant. Thank you, thank you very much. You don't have to follow me out. When Gustav honks like that, he has a clear conscience. (comfort music) It's a strange place. - It's the city's best food places. And then it goes quickly. - It's hidious here. A votre santa. Au succes de nos affaires. Excuse me for a moment... Is it an exhausting meeting? Come on, we're going home. And the roses I will have, I will have to buy myself. Leave this lady tout de suite! They must not interfere at all! Herbert?! Je vous praviens, monsieur! Leave it, human! They kill him! I know your type well! Wasn't that Herbert? - As long as he hasn't beaten himself. He's not doing anything wrong! - You didn't call him? I was prevented. - Jussi, you are such a fool! Do you understand... It's her husband. son mary - Mondieu, elle est mariae? I have never been so embarrassed! You must be out of your mind, Herbert! It's a scandal. How did you come up with that? And without a tie! So Jussi was right. - Yes. So it cannot be done. Then I have to give it up. So I have to stop. What is that? It's just a gift for you. - To me? Why? And you have eaten. What a nice table. Was it something special? It's the 17th just a little while longer. Our wedding day... - Don't think about that. I am very, very sorry. I am. Sorry. Sorry. I will never do it again. Beloved. You must not stop! I mean at the factory. Wait until Aunt Karla hears, - that her director were involved in a fight. She doesn't get to know that. - Jussi tells it. He was there from start to finish. - Was Jussi?! I don't go to such a place alone. - That's what he said on the phone. He said he hadn't spoken to you. Oh! I'm not done playing strongman. Fuck that. We have 20 minutes left. 20 minutes? - From our wedding day. (the doorbell rings) - We're not opening up, are we? No! It's probably just someone calling. (it rings again) - Yes, it could be something important. No more business meetings tonight! - No. Sorry, Monsieur Nielsen. Je ne savais pas... Aah... even reason. Come on in. They are impulsive, the French, but charming. You've been to a bar. - Me? No... Yeah, I stopped by to see how it was going. He is a former French jiu-jitsu champion... And you are the current world champion of fraud. Herbert, it's time you opened your eyes. And it's time you got yours closed. Parfait, Monsieur Nielsen. Formidable. Come on in. Roses! 10, 20, 30, 40, 50... 10, 20, 30, 40... - Hey, hey, watch the cups. Who is the best mother in the whole world? Mrs. Batman. - No, it's our mother! Ungrateful offspring. I feed them and wipe their noses. Then it's you they hang around your neck. Trille, you have to go to school. - I want to go to the bathroom first! This also applies to you, Madam Director. Herbert, I'm not going in there. - What? Are you ill? No, not like that. - How so? Is it because of yesterday? - There must be a board meeting. Aunt Karla never agrees to carry it out. I'm getting fired. Can't you pull ashore a bit? - No! Well. Can you get going then! You must! No, no! - You can... and you must! Be a great director and do as dad says. Get in the shower and hit the table! I don't have time for you today. Don't forget that you are the breadwinner with responsibility for husband and child! It is the most delightful cookbook I have seen. I got the very first copy from the bookseller, there was a queue. It's nice. It's art, Herbert. Applied art. How did you get the enchanting idea? Aah, that... that's a surprise. Fantastic. They must write a dedication in it to me. It must have the honorary place in my bookcase. Also a greeting in this one. Sister Karla must have it. If I didn't have to write in aunt Karla's book and in your... They who are the true friend of art, the protector of poetry. Friend, yes, but protector? I don't brag about that. You could make an effort if you wanted to. Dear poet, I am too old to be a muse... Shouldn't we both have refreshments? Yes, but not that apple juice, dear Herbert, not apple juice. Do you think I should do that? Sister Karla becomes desperate. (clap) - Thank you, thank you. The chairman of Danish Women's Emancipation makes - the award ceremony and diploma awarding. Yes, ladies, - what I have seen of your assignments has impressed me. But we women must also move on. The time is not far off when men are educated here, - so that we women can have time to rule the world... and them. And now for the exam results. The first prize as the best student of the year has been won by Miss... ... miss... Herbert Nielsen. (clap) Nooo! (laughter) 3 eggs are divided and the whites are saved for the meringue. The whites are saved for meringue, well... like that. Also? Hurry up, Martha. - Whip the plums carefully. Plums... Do we have plums? - No, egg yolks. But then read properly, Martha. No, I will myself! Cooking is more fun than I thought. Strange that I haven't found anything about it before. Aah, Gustav, how it suits you. And... garlic? The binoculars, quick, Martha. And I have always considered him to be a sissy boy. Hoof, hoof, hoof. Gustav... I have now expressed my opinion about the structural change, - and I would advise against supporting such ideas. A French jumper must not interfere with how our ties should look. Director Nielsen doesn't put his position on that, does he? Barely. I know that girl. Those who vote for the director's proposal raise their hands. Thank you, gentlemen, I am not surprised. But we vote against. Hands up, Dorit. I don't vote. I have shares worth DKK 62,000, - and I vote neither for nor against. Herbert has asked me to... well, for art's sake. What has art and ties... - H.C. Andersen writes... Here I decide! Do you have no independent opinion? Yes, I always thought your ties were funny, Karla said. Bitten... can you do it? Are you sick? - Just some nausea... Bitten, take it easy. What the hell am I supposed to do?! You must go home! - Yes. Fantastic. This is our Herbert. Isn't the picture on the outside pretty? That is great. You're not mad, are you? Was to be a surprise. I have already sent out the second edition. Here... a small check as an advance. More to come. (plays modern music) Are they all neighbors? There are no ladies who suit me like the needle to a thread there is no such thing as ladies... Business first. You must come to me with something like that. There is as much money in it as in porn. ... an old boy's temperature rises... I really don't understand, you find time to write. I have an important message from Director Nielsen. Them speak, man. - Yes, please. First, I would like to announce that I have done some research. It turns out that there is great interest in our new designs. Decadence. Where is Bitten? She felt unwell. She has also gone home now. She asked me to let you know that you can expect her resignation. Nonsense! Does she not know that her damned proposal has been adopted? She said she wants to concentrate on her husband and her 3 children. There we have the man again! 3 children?! She only has 2. (loud music) You don't need to turn off because I'm coming... Hi. Hi, friend... it's... it's my schoolmates. And that's my wife, director Nielsen. Former director. Goodbye. Why would you quit now? There is something you are hiding from me. Herbert? Herbert, come here and sit down. Do not be sad. Don't you want something to drink? We must dance like the ladies! - Mother, we've had fun. We're going to teach you how to go-go. - No, it won't do. From now on, mother will rest. And plenty of hot water. Is mom sick? - What do you say to a little sister? Are you pregnant, daddy? (they laugh) Come on. - I'll wait here, right? No, come along. - Is it necessary now? Yes, otherwise I wouldn't have said it. We are going to have a little sister. - Where is she? Then they're happy, huh? - I'd rather have a mouse. Bitten, now you've got your way! I have raised you to be independent. You do not leave your post because the reckless men - sticks a cap in the wheel. Do you hear! Bitten, this is the highlight of your career. Clap in, Dorit! You must come back. You can get a sub-director. Even a man. What about Herbert? He seems to have hidden abilities. What do you say? - No, one director is enough. And my place is in the home. There's a lot of smoke in the kitchen, man. You should not think about. It does not matter. --- Subtitles by Essery. ---
