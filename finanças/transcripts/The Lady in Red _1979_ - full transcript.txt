Your name? Ruby Keeler. How do you spell that? And I run it clean. I find out you been chipping it around on the side, you'll hit the street, get it? Yeah, sure. And I don't let in no Greeks, chinks, or Filipinos, no matter how much jack they got. A girl can make a good honest livin' here. Only she's gotta be straight with me, get it? - Yeah, I get it. - Good. Now we have to get something for you to wear. And them clodhoppers ain't goin' to make it. It's my turn to be on top tonight. You were on top last night. Oh, come on, you know I got a bad back. Okay, bend over. It hurts! It's all right, just relax. You're squishin' me, I can't breathe. You're gonna be a hunchback for life. What are you guys doin'? The old hawk can't see so good if it's dark, because we do the suckers back here. For what? To make a livin' honey, what else? Well, you get half of every ticket, don't you? Thinks she's gonna make a million, this one. Ah, a nickel a. Look, a sucker wants a slow grind, that's okay. He wants to get a little busy with his hands, that's okay too, as long as he pays. Every night we unscrew the bulbs. And every mornin', she screws 'em back in. You think she'd give up. You get 95 cents. - That's not a bad start. - Mm-hmm. 95 cents? Well, what did I tell ya? You gotta make it on the side. That's the way it's set up. What do you think, they come here to dance? Hey, girl, you're gettin' smart. Cash up front, house rules. Sure, no sweat. Sorry, honey. Justice is swift. Oh, Jesus, why pick on me? Say, most guys'd wait'll after the hand-job. Now you come along nice and quiet, I'll put in a good word with His Honor. Ladies, my name is Alice. And from now on you are to address me as yes ma'am and no ma'am. And if you think you can get around me, or you think you can hide anything from me, even up your keisters, well then you better think twice. From now on, I rate top billing in all your nightmares. Now bend over and spread 'em wide. Oh, Red... How 'bout a girl like me, Red? It's reserved. Well, I'm not sleepin' on the floor. There's one open over there with the lunger. Do you mind if I bunk here? Who's your tailor, huh? Rose! Rose! I don't believe it! Nigger gal, can't you turn them sheets any faster? That's the speed them sheets is comin' at. Did ya hear that, ladies? Nigger gal says you're sluffin' off on the job. Now whaddya think of that? Leave her alone. Huh, it would be you. The sheeny stickin' up for the nigger. You know, I don't think I should let you stay in here with all these white gals, Shimkus. Somehow, it just don't seem right. I feel sorry for you. No. Anything else? You just bought yourself a week in the cooler, girlie. Keep crankin', ladies, I'll be back. You wanted to see me? I've been watching you. And I think you've got too much sense to be in this dump. Is that a compliment? Look, girlie, we can play ball or we can fight. And if we fight, I'll win. And the sooner you blow wise to that, the better off you'll be. Now, has anyone explained the furlough system to you? Don't waste your time, I don't have a red cent, inside or out. Well, I could arrange certain terms. I never buy on credit. And I thought you were smarter than your friend. Hey, Dillinger busted out of the can today. Busted out. You all right? Oh, I'm cold. Polly. - I'm so cold. - It's okay. It's okay, you're with me now, honey. Good behavior, I'm outta here in two months. Get myself a job. Dancin'? Dancin'. Only this time, up on stage, for real money. So's when you get outta here, you can just lie there like a lump till you get your health back. Then what? Then, we go to Hollywood. You'd be surprised, people stand in line for this kind of entertainment. People stand in line for a lot of things these days. Afternoon, ladies. My, my, my, but that's a nasty cough. She oughta be in the infirmary. I'm not talking to you. Whoops! On your feet, Shimkus. I said, on your feet! That's enough. And what do you think you're gonna do with that? I think I'm gonna cram it up your ass sideways. No, don't. Oh. Leave her. Huh, huh? You just drew yourself another three months, girlie. And that's just for starters. Wait! How much? Well, my girls usually send home 10 a week. But you've been stubborn, it'll be 15 a week. And if you miss a payment, I'll have the navs run you in and we'll start from scratch. I want Rose to finish out her time in the infirmary. Oh, then that'll be 20 a week. You know how to make that kind of money? I got an idea. I'll bet you do. Well, here's an address. She'll set ya up nice. And someone'll be around once a week for my cut. Arlene Street. Yes? Anna Sage? Who wants to know? Tiny Alice sent me. Oh. In that case, welcome to the club. Now you bundle some good shoes and your street clothes, and leave 'em in the back hall, just in case there's trouble. Now, when a john picks ya out, you get a ticket from Pops here. - Howdy. - Hi. Uh, this here is Pinetop. - Enchante. - Ah ah, I'll ahn-shan your tay. Pay attention, this is business. Green is two dollars, blue is five dollars, and red, that's 10 dollars. Pops knows all the johns, knows what league they're in. Don't worry 'bout it. Uh, what's the difference between 'em? It is all in their minds, baby. It's all in their minds.

Nah, he couldn't get up on no horse. Maybe he done it in a wheelchair. Am I right, Pops? The only thing more pitiful than an old con is an old whore. Ain't that right, sugar? Right, Frognose. You hear anybody else around here call me that, huh? Then why do you say it? You're gonna make that up to me, sugar, in spades. Get your butt up them stairs! All part of the show, folks.

Now, I pay doctor bills, breakage, gas, electric, water, linens, salaries for Pops and Pinetop. And I pay Frognose for protection. Well, what's he here for then? I only protect her from police harassment. Frognose collects for Mr. Luciano. Mm, very unpleasant fellow. Threatenin' poor girls with battery acid. And breakin' fingers and breakin' legs, ah. He takes half of my cut, and he takes half of your cut. - So this is mine then. - Ah, ah, ah! Not quite, dear. I'll be collectin' for Tiny Alice. Oh, I forgot. Are you dancin'?

That's it, that. Well, it sort of depends. Sometimes I walk straight up to the guy, here comes a long-lost brother, smilin', put my hand out to him to shake, you know. Sometimes I just sort of... Oh, God! Jesus, where did that come from? Well, you know, all them guys I hit, I'll bet you they ask themselves the same question. What's your rush, sister? Gimme a break, will ya? Be polite, this is my street. Look, kid, it costs guys money just to talk to me. Yeah? Well, I ain't buyin', I'm sellin'. - Protection. - Oh, yeah?

You're just another member of the Dillinger gang, right? Another daring hold-up? Go on, scram. Come on, Tiger. You're too dangerous to leave in the street. Get outta here! All right, just get outta here! I don't like it. He told me you bought him one. I mean the kid. Well he can help out around here. He could uh, he could help with the heavy liftin', right, Pops? What heavy lifting? He could help me clean. - Could help clean? - Yeah, just clean. Yeah, I could clean. Okay, room and board. But if I catch you even sniffing around my girls, I personally will cut it off! She uses hedge clippers, too, kid. Get into this, dear, you have a party to go to. Who are all these people anyway? Oh, don't know all the names, but not a one of 'em earns a honest livin'. Who's that guy? - Who's who? - The glad-hander over there. That, my dear, is the Deputy Mayor. Don't you read the papers? Not if I can help it. Turk! All right, let's go over it again. After you heard the shots... I ran to where the shots came from. And you saw... Like I told you, Mister Ness, I saw a couple of gorillas. And you didn't see the face of either one of them? Even for an instant? Hey, there was shots, there were people screamin' and runnin' all over the place. Boys. Take off your hat. Take off your hat. Is this one of the men? We're special agents, Polly, we can protect ya. Nah, it wasn't him. You're positive? Yeah, I'm sure. Who could forget a mug like that? All right, get him outta here. You have perhaps a secret admirer? Oh, you might say that. You're gonna poison us all, Shimkus. I'm careful. You like it in here, don't ya? Beats scrubbin' the halls. It's okay. It's okay, she says, don't sound too grateful. Look, I do my time, and I... Best friend bustin' her buns, and she says it's okay. What? She didn't tell you our deal? Polly's workin' a club. Polly's peddlin' her ass, sweet thing, to keep you off my shit list. I put her in a house. You're lyin'. Well why do you think you're on the tit all of a sudden? She's taken on half of Chicago. You're a fuckin' liar! And they say she's a natural. Bitch! You wouldn't dare. A good soldier has fallen in the crucible of struggle. But we must not be cast down by grief and despair. Rose Shimkus gave her life so that no man, woman or child should have to go hungry. - So that a living... - What are you doin' here? Shall be the right of every woman... Lookin' for Dracula. - So that no one... - Ah, straighten up your tie. Who's the lady in red? Ah, some Bolshevik dame that got killed in a prison riot. Oh. Begged some kind of big demands... Yeah, I'll be back. The most fitting tribute we can offer is simply this, for each of us to bow to Friend of yours? - Scram! - For those... Polly, what's the scoop? - Oh, come on. - I got nothin' to say to you. Now get the hell outta here. Now listen, suppose I give you five dollars, that's your price isn't... Don't touch me. Don't you fucking touch me or I'll kill you, I swear to God I will! Dedicate ourselves to the proposition - that the workers and... - Go figure hookers. Where's that yellow broad? Hey! Where's that yellow broad? You don't have to be hollerin', Mister, I can hear. You hidin' from me, girl? I ain't hidin' from nobody, I'm just doin' my job. Then get you nigger ass up them stairs. I know! Sam, sweetheart? - Don't worry. - Yeah. The day I can't handle the likes of him, I'd best get out my needle and sew it shut. Come on, Mister. He's on a mean one tonight.

You don't have to worry about my paper. Sure. You are in Frognose's pocket, I know it. I try to take care of my girls. I may not be big bargain as person, maybe. But I tried to take care of my girls. Come on, Eddie, get your plates out there, will ya? Come on... Get 'em over here! What were you thinkin' about when you did that? How could you be so clumsy? Ah, dammit! Polly, Polly, pick up! Okay.

Dull, all I remember eating is potatoes and eggplant. Eggplant and potatoes, ugh. And all the jokes are something filthy about the livestock. Miss! Can I help you? Yeah, I like coffee and a Sanka. Anything else you like? Yeah, I like your looks. Oh, Christ. Well I just thought I'd tell ya. I'll call a cop. Easy, I just wanna talk to ya. Look, Mister, I been slingin' hash all day, and I don't have the energy for no palm-tickler with big ideas, so shove off, all right? I been watchin' last couple days. You're all right. Sure. You're not half as tough as you think you are, either. Try me. Like the movies? Yeah, so what? So do I, but I hate to go alone. Why don't you go to the movies with me? What are you, deaf? Beat it. I'll treat, I'll even buy the popcorn. Oh, you're a sport. What'd I ever do to deserve you? I'll put a box of popcorn in the seat between us. Now what's playin' down the block? You escaped from the bughouse, right? There's guys with butterfly nets on your tail. He's always been king of his world, but we'll teach him fear. We're millionaires, boys. In a few months, it'll be up in lights: Kong, the Eighth Wonder of the World. They shouldn't have brung him to New York like that, all them damn reporters with their flashbulbs. It was the girl's fault. Hey, she didn't ask him to fall for her. She was just standin' there and he starts pawin' her. Beauty killed the beast my ass, it was all them reporters. How's it goin', sweetheart? Just fine. Me and Jimmy are takin' the kid out tonight. Jimmy. That same guy? Yeah. He's okay, you know? There's somethin' kinda screwy about him, but I like him, he's okay. You girls never learn, do you? I still think Long John was a good egg. Nah, he wasn't square with the kid. Not once did he say, kid, I'm a pirate, this is how it's done. He's always makin' out to be somethin' else. Yeah, but think of that one guy, marooned all them years. Yeah, like solitary with more room. You ever done time? Nah. Seen it in pictures, though. Ah, now, you see. You gotta get it off your shoulder. It's a bat, not an umbrella. Lemme show ya. Look, you see the trademark, right? - Yeah. - Get it out here. You gotta keep your eye out there, right? Hold it up. Hold up the bat, will you? Good! That's it. - I'm sorry. - You, you go get it. Come on, I'll go with you. What a headline hog, writin' letters to the paper. How do you know if it was Dillinger who really wrote it? Who else would be that much of a jerk? Want a piece? Nah, I'm full. He was probably just playin' with the coppers. Says here some poor guy almost got blasted last week, just for lookin' like him. A lot of guys look like him. Yeah. Even you look a little like him, Jimmy. I hope the FBI checks my ID before they start shootin'. Well, you'd think he'd just hole up somewheres and play it safe, instead of advertising in the papers. Yeah, you'd think so, wouldn't you? Was it all right? If you don't know for yourself, I can't tell ya. Well I thought it was real nice. Then it was all right. I used to do it for a living. Yeah. You know? Doesn't make any difference, kid. I'm sure. I mean,. You've gotta trust me. Well, why won't it bother you like it would somebody else? 'Cause people do, well they do things when they've got the screws on 'em. Doesn't mean who they are, what they are. Take me, hmm. Shit, I've done a lot of things. But you've always been square with me, girl. And that's what really counts. How'd you find out? You work for Anna Sage, she's got a name in this town. Pick up! And what was this arrest in Gary for? I don't remember. February, 1929. Well, there was some sort of little thing about liquor. Violation of federal statutes under the Volstead Act. In August of '31, East Chicago? Operation of a disorderly house, October '31. Shh, please. Come. Look, fellas, I admit, I've been a wrong character. But I am getting it right now, I got this diner, and it's 100% legit. Six counts of common prostitution between 1918 and 1924. And the Balducci affair? What? A death in the Arlene Street operation, in which a Mr. Rocco Balducci was involved. Oh, no you don't, no dice. Maybe you ship me off, but I go in one piece. If you were to cooperate with us, give us some information on your underworld connections. You are talking to the wrong girl. You see, I got this terrible memory. You remember Romania, Mrs. Sage? Oh, we go back a long way, Anna. That is why I come to you. They want me to throw them someone. Nick, Luciano, Frognose, somebody big. The feds must be squeezin' 'em. And they are squeezin' me, but good. They say I ain't fit. They say I ain't citizen! You just have faith in me, darling. Someone'll turn up. Where would you go? California. What's out there? An ocean. They got a whole coast. And orange groves, some place they got cactus. And they got Redwood trees that high. A guy could get lost out there. You wanna get lost somewhere? Yeah. Yeah, I bet you out there a man wouldn't have a history, he could be anybody he wanted to be. I'd want a house. Sure, on a hill. Overlookin' the water. You wanna go? When? In a week's time. Why drag our feet? Besides, this town's too hot for me. You know a good movie to see? What? It's with Victor McLaughlin, it's called The Champ. Little kid actor, Jacky Cooper. It's really, yeah. When did you see it? So, to what do we owe the honor? I uh heard the food was good. Oh. How's your, uh, immigration beef comin'? So what is that to you? I'm a snoop, I like to know things. Who's that character? Just a guy, he eats lunch here regular. He's sweet on Polly. Why, you know him? He oughta go in for a Johnny Dillinger lookalike contest. He says he works at the grain exchange. Half the con men in Cook County use that line. And the other half? They work for the Tribune. - It's him. - Eddie took it for me. I been lookin' at pictures of this bird for a year now. It's Dillinger, it is, mm-hmm. So what do we do? See the right people. Pick the right time, and you're off the hook with the immigration! And the feds? I know just the man. And the immigration? I have to be honest with you, that's out of my jurisdiction, but the bureau will do everything that it possibly can. Now, about this Franklin girl. Well, she will be a big help. Good. Anna, it'll really be useful to us if you can wear somethin' so that we can pick you outta the crowd. Somethin' special, a scarf, or a dress. Preferably somethin' bright. Well, Polly, she always went for red. Excellent, excellent, that's perfect. Okay. Hey, why can't I come to work with you today? Because it's boring, a lot of guys standin' around shoutin' grain prices. Yeah, but I wanna see what you're like when you work. But it's not me, it's just, it's just a show. Oh yeah? So how 'bout when you're with me, is that a show too? No, I don't have to think about the show. Have you thought about goin' to California? - Yeah. - And? Well, I've been wonderin' where the money's gonna come from. You don't have to worry about the money. I got some irons in the fire. You know, Jimmy, sometimes I think I don't know the first thing about you. What's to know? I have two arms, two legs. And I know all the words to "Yes, We Have No Bananas." Do you? ♪ Yes, we have no bananas ♪ ♪ We have no bananas today ♪ See you later, kid. Listen, sweetheart, you know anyone seen more men in action than I have? Well, believe me, he is just another bum. Why don't you come to the show with us tonight? Take a closer look for yourself. He's different from them others, you'd see. Go out, in this heat? Jimmy can't stand to stay cooped up inside. Look, I'm all turned around with this thing, I need somebody to tell me am I dreamin' or what. Sure, sweetheart, I will come. Hey, waitress. - Purvis? - Yeah. Tonight. Where? The Biograph. Both of us, and him. I never had nothin' like him, you know? Sure, kid. And it's not like he's some square fay, either. He's been around the block, I can tell. Sure he has. I feel like I'm comin' out from all the garbage, you know? Like I been buried for a long time and somebody finally came along to dig me out. And he knows all about what I've been. So what is wrong with what you been? You worked in a knock shop, so what? Well, it's nothing against you, Anna, it's just... You've been with scum, and now you think you are better, is that it? - No. - Well, listen, sweetheart. You think you had it tough? When I come here, they dragged me right off the boat and put me in the harness. The land of opportunity. Well, I worked naked in a crib for nickels and dimes! And I kept the coins in my mouth because I didn't have no pockets, see? So don't come at me with no bullshit about nothing! What's the matter with you? I was just telling you that I feel good, that's all. I just want you should know what I been. So you will understand. Understand what? Oh, nothing. Just a broken-down old whore getting punchy. So what is wrong with your red dress? Oh, I wore it the other night. Listen, it's like a bake oven out there. And this is the lightest thing you got. And you look like a million dollars in it. When I light a match, we move in and we move in fast. Lawlessness in America is doomed. J. Edgar Hoover and his G-men, born again on the 4th of July, when they ambushed a band of armed and desperate bank robbers in their Indianapolis hideout. A fierce gun battle ended with the capture of these public enemies. Law enforcement officers take their hats off to the American public for supporting J. Edgar Hoover in his war against crime. Excuse me, what time does the show get out? 9:45. Are they always right on schedule? Yes. Okay, thank you. Ugh. Uh, uh, nope, revenge isn't the ticket. Try and get even, you never get ahead. You should have been Gable's lawyer. Who is that? Dillinger. - It's Dillinger. - It's Dillinger. - It's Dillinger. - Dillinger. Polly, Polly! Oh Eddie... Eddie, let me in, I gotta talk to you. You fuckin' rat! It wasn't me, Eddie! Believe me, it was Anna. Yeah, well that ain't how it says in the papers. Well the papers are full of shit! I didn't even know it was him, he never told me. He lied to me! Eddie, listen to me, it was Anna and Jake Lingle and Hennessey, they set him up. He didn't even have a gun, I know he didn't. They just shot him down, cold, in the street. Eddie, come on, open up. They're after me now and I need a place to stay, please. He was John Dillinger. He was just another fucking liar. And they're out there selling his handkerchiefs dipped in his blood. Are you gonna get even, with Anna and them? No, kid. I'm gonna get ahead. This is the big one, isn't it? It's one you always dreamed about, Pops. Polly, they'll come after us. Yeah, but with a wad of dough and the muscle to back us, we can go anywhere. You said so yourself. I need you, Pops. You're the only one's got the smarts to pull this thing off. The only one. Yeah, Polly, I guess I am, at that. Let's do it. Say, you're gonna get me hung out here, talkin' with white women, you know what I mean? Well, here, carry the suitcase and make like I gave you nickel to carry it for me. A whole nickel? I don't wanna break you. Hey, listen, if we pull this thing off, we're gonna be in the chips for good. Yeah, and if we don't? Either way, our troubles are over. Why not? Because you're a kid, that's why not. Come on, I'm almost 19. - Like I said... - We need four, Polly. Pops says we need four. Hold it, I was not but 14 when I first stood chickie on a job. Yeah. Okay. What the hell, I should've left you to starve. That, my friends, is one boss that even Johnny Dillinger wouldn't tackle. Yeah, well, looks pretty soft to me. That's the mob's piggy bank. No questions asked, no feds sniffin' around at your records. Don't let the size fool ya. It may look small, but you ice that one, you bought yourself a mess of trouble. So why mess with it? Who's gonna have more money in one place? So what's the beef? I always write what you say, don't I? The word is, snoop, you're tight with the frail that threw Dillinger in. Boss, she wouldn't say nothin' about you. Once a rat, always a rat. You just point the way, we'll take it from there. Don't worry, Mr. Balducci, I'll take care of it. Hi. How you doin'? Pretty good. Don't, Eddie. Aw come on, I've been givin' it my best for two weeks now. Well, I'll sleep on the floor, you want me to? No, I wanna sleep with ya. You're just a kid. Oh, I'm old enough to stick my neck out for you, but I'm not old enough to sleep with you? Hold it, Mister, if you want out of this, it's not too late. I don't want out. I want you. You know, everybody else in this fuckin' city's had you, why not me? All right. Call it. Head. You lose, she's mine. Some kinda comedian, ain't ya, Frank? Frank? They're gonna kill me! - What happened? - They're gonna kill me! What's wrong? Frank and Momo, they come after me. Frognose. And Lingle too, he's the one that put the finger on me. You know we don't serve dingies in here. Oh, um, service payment for Frognose? He's in the can. Beg your pardon, Top. Hey, I haven't seen or heard you ticklin' those ivories lately, what happenin', huh? All right, where's Jake? He went that way, man. He went that way. Some nigger, Jake, what'd he want with you? It's bughouse! All right, everybody, now listen. We're not gonna fool around with these tellers' cages 'cause there's nothin' in there, there's no dough in there, the big dough is back in the vault, come on, Polly, that's your department. Now you get back in there, and you take care of the vault, that's your whole responsibility, you got that? Now, Piney. - Yeah? - Piney, get up here. Yeah, I'm... Now look, you get all the citizens, and you get them against those cages there. - Seriously? - Yeah. Get the citizens there, I'll take care of the guards. One and two. Those guards look pretty tough to me, Pop. Yes, and those guards, one of 'em's a shooter for the Jenn-a family and the other one, I don't know, but I'm gonna take care of both those murderin' bastards, don't you worry about that. Now this thing only takes but three minutes. What the hell are you doin' sittin' down? Get up there, you're supposed to be in the goddamn car! You know what you're supposed to do? You're supposed to keep anybody from blockin' the car, and if you see any heat comin' down the street, you hit that horn, - have you got that? - Got it. You got it, all right. Okay, everybody, now listen, let's take our places. And let's do it right this time. Now, this thing is only gonna take but three minutes. Three minutes. Now, when we get almost done, you're gonna hear me holler, "Time!" And when I say time, that means move! All right, now, one, two, three, let's do it. With Frognose outta the picture, maybe they're not gonna make a drop. The mob is gonna let a death in the family upset their cash flow? Frognose, he collected last night. Somebody's gonna deposit it this morning. How're we gonna know who it is? I have a nose for that sort of thing. Just let me know if you see something fishy. What about this bunch here? Nah. Think I'd recognize the old geezer. Used to be a senator or something. Good afternoon, Mr. James. More deposits? He'd like to see the vault first. He worries about security. There are all those steps. I wanna see the vault, I wanna see the vault! He's really got his heart set on it, then. Very well. Guards! You rub Purvis the wrong way, and you draw all the dog-shit details. Sure you don't want a bite? Uh, no thanks. Freeze! The vault, Mister. Hey, you! - Step on it. - Get your hands down, dammit! Move, move! Let's see the rings, come on, get 'em out! Let's see the ring! We know you got the big ones in here, - so don't pretend. - What? I see anything under a 50, it's curtains for you. Wanna join the group? Okay, now let's see a nice smile. That's it. Now, when the law asks, all you gotta say is, they all look alike. My, my, such big bills for such a little bank. I don't really do this, I'm actually a singer. Now listen, boys, when the lady comes by with her bag, I want you to drop your rods right into it. Just like trick or treatin'. Time! Big triple funeral this afternoon. The mob's probably buying out the florist. The old bird's walkin'! What? He goes in on wheels, and he comes out on his feet! Better call the office and get some people out here. It's either a miracle or a stick-up. Get me Captain Hennessey! It's an emergency! Nice and smooth, Pinetop. Smooth always, Pops. Pinetop! Okay, I got him. Get! Come on, Pops. Come on. - Okay now. - Come on. Tell the boys to shoot to kill. That they will, sir. And tell 'em to keep their noses out of the loot. Here comes a car now, it might be them. Indeed. Oh, Christ! - All right, be careful. - Here they came! Hang on! Let's get 'em before they get away. What are you doin'? Trust me. All right, you... You did it! Whoa. Ah, shit. - What? - Inspect the gas. It's almost empty. Fill it up. Yes sir, you betcha. Hey! Hey, come here! Can you hear me, Pops? We're gonna get you a doc, Pops. - Where's the gas? - I don't know! The side, maybe. The side. Get outta here. - But Eddie... - I'll hold 'em back, you go do the other part like we planned. - But Eddie! - Get outta here! What was that? That was the kid, Pops, that was the kid. We're tapped, Pops, we're outta gas. Gimme my gun. What do you want it for? It hurts too bad, Polly, I can't take it no more. But they're gonna be here soon, they'll get you a doc. No, I done too much time. I don't wanna die on the inside. Get me my gun! It's in your hand, Pops. Oh, Jesus Christ, I can't feel a thing. Can you feel that? Huh? Them are hundreds, Pops, you feel it? Them are hundreds. I guess I'm gonna die rich, huh, Pol? I don't wanna die in jail. Polly, help me out. Polly, goddammit, help me out. Yeah, I'll see ya there. Here's a fella says John Dillinger isn't really dead. Says the whole thing at the Biograph was a setup, just to get the heat off him. Who knows, there might be some mileage in old Johnny yet. It's okay, honey, your dress, it's all I want, your dress. Jake Lingle? How are ya? Polly Franklin? Sends her regards. Where to, Missy? West. Yeah, well you came to the right place. You ever been all the way? Huh? You ever seen the Pacific? Everybody should see it once before they're plowed under. Yeah, sure. California.
