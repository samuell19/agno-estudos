You heard him! Hey! What are you doing? Keep on digging. All we need is a piece of bone. Just a piece of bone. Can't dig any further. That’s it. Nothing here. I don't think there's anything here. What Should We do? We've dug pretty low already. There's nothing. What Should We do? Let's go. Wrap it up. Clear the way! Hey, granny! Hold on! Wait! Wait! Tell them what you were trying to tell us. You know, with your fingers... Like this. Yeah, I Saw it too! Why are you lying? What are you doing to an old lady? Just Wait. Please. Look at me and make that gesture again. Just do it! Shut it! There! There! YOU See? What the heck is this? She pointed at Jong-ho's father. I can validate this action through various theories. It's a habitual gesture resulting from traumatic experience, and expression of fear towards the suspect. It's a clear gesture hinting that Jong-ho's parents are the suspect. It's One Of five human behaviors. - Professor HWANG? - What? Look behind you. This means you're the suspect? What are you doing? Now I'm the suspect, and so is he! Snap out of its She's always been like that! Before the kids disappeared! He's insane. She was always like that! - So there's nothing, huh? - That bastard! What’s with you!? Still up? Think of it as a good thing. No one will be suspicious any more. I don't Care about that. Then What? They all think our son is dead. Not one person believes he's alive. Hon? Yeah? Did we make a mistake? Don't think about it. What wouldn't we do to find our son? Yes? Ji-seung! I'm sure Jong-ho's alive. Someone is guarding him. Mr. KIM will move the kids' bodies to the mountain later So I'll follow him. I'm going to stake out and catch him in the act. Are you listening? Producer KANG?! LETTER OF RESIGNATION You think everything's that easy? I'm sorry. Hey! Come back here, now! Ji-seung! Ji-seung! Despite years of intensive investigation, the investigation team dissolved into a task force. Detective PARK moved to another department, and I returned to Seoul. The anticipated order to return to Seoul just felt like another let-down. But life continued on. - Hi - Hey 2001, 10 years later - Don't drink too much. - Yeah, yeah. Get home. IS that Won-gil's brother? That’s WON-SEOK. Now, it’s the kids that nag, not the Wife. He's grown a lot. I wouldn't recognize him. If we met our lost sons on the streets, - We wouldn't recognize them. - No, we wouldn't. I sometimes have this dream. A man appears with a piece of cloth around his head like this, Saying he's Jong-ho. I can't see his face but he gets angry That I don't recognize him. - Bro. - What? I have cancer. How do you know? Look at my stomach bulging out. Come on. That's nothing. Civilian casualties are on the rise due to Typhoon RUSA... Major mountain slides and floods are causing serious damages. Nakdong River is in danger of major flooding, due to the typhoon. Over 870mm of rain fell yesterday on the northern province. Nothing major flooding, due to the typhoon... Sir! Let's take these chestnuts! Come here! Why? I think this is... - What is it? - Look. Wasn't there a psycho who accused the parents as the suspect and dug up their house? September 26th, 2002 shut up! This way, chief. After all that searching, and they're buried here? PARK, come here. This is ridiculous. This area was thoroughly searched. Let's say that the children got cold, and covered themselves with leaves. SO We Couldn’t find them. It'll be a closed case if it’s natural death. Leave it Unsolved. - You know what I mean? - Yes, sir. Take 3 close look. - These are not our kids. - Are they them? I don't think it’s them. Oh... There is a track suite. It says NAMDONG ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, not DEOK-SUH. Are you listening? That's my son. My son... My son used to go to that school before he transferred. He wore that track suit that day. I think that’s him... What are you saying? What’s the CAUSE Of death? Police say it was hypothermia. I have no answers yet. The parents have confirmed the children's clothes and verified the remains as the missing children. We think the cause Of death is hypothermia. It was drizzling in the evening on the day of their disappearance. Wasn't Mt. To-ap thoroughly searched? This is a little far from where they disappeared. Therefore this area wasn't as thoroughly searched, AS Other areas. What are you saying? That’s bullshit! Why would they not come home And freeze to death here? We searched for them all over, from here down to the base. The kids came around here like it’s their backyard. How dare you say it was natural death? YOU SOD Of 3 bitch! This is Bullshit! Isn't that the psycho who came to dig up Jong-ho's house? Why the hell is he here? Why the hell are you here? Who are you after this time? Do you know Jong-ho's father passed away? Who killed him? You bastards did. YOU... You Still think the parents killed them? Jong-ho's father went to his dead son. He died wrongly accused, and sent our kids back to us! You have no right to be here! GO. Get lost. Get the hell out of here! Enough! For all this time... You've been lying here? Right in front Of home? Hey, Producer KANG! I told you he'll move the remains. They thoroughly searched all over Mt. To-ap. Even this area, for sure. But why are the bodies found now? Because they were moved. So Who moved them here? Did you know Jong-ho's father rebuilt his house? They put in a new foundation How can you say that? You saw the remains. That doesn't mean one of em is Jong-ho. You can easily get human bones... That's enough, you son of a bitch. Jong-ho's father passed away. SO? Is that my fault? What about you? So let’s drop this. Enough already. Fine. Stick to the facts. Prove that the remains weren't moved here. Enough! You want to be that famous and special? - I Said stick to the facts! - Facts? Fine. What about the recording of Jong-ho and his mother? What about it? They talk in that tone through most of the recording, Because they were tired of all the prank calls Bur they still hoped it might be him. What about Jong-ho's father's alibi!? His colleagues testified that they weren't sure if Jong-ho's father left early that day. Why did you leave that part out? Why?! Because then you'd be proven wrong. That’s fabrication. He clocked in at the factory that day. There's evidence, you son of a bitch! You're the ones who put the shovel in my hands! I wasn't the only one. But I took all the blame for it! YOU coward! You think you're so brave and smart? Fuck you. Admit it. We just Wanted to make the headline. I bet everything! And I lost: everything! My family! My job! And my reputation! What about you? What the hell did you lose? KANG! Was if murder? Was if murder? I'm sorry. I didn't come to get a story. I'm the one who accused the parents as murderer. I recognize you. You're the one who dug up that house. Come in. I heard the remains Were moved. That's impossible. The spine of the last body was found completely intact. You can't move the remains without damaging the spine. You said their clothes were used to tie them up? Their jackets were tied around their heads, and their legs were tied up with their pants.. He used square knots often used by sailors. The one who made the knot can easily untie it. SQUARE KNOT These wounds were found mainly on the Skull of the eldest boy. That's magnified through a microscope. There's a SENSE Of direction here. Like it's been pecked or chiseled. Over 20 times. Was if closer to sever abuse than murder? Maybe he tried to frighten or torture them? And enjoyed inflicting pain? Probably a psychopath. This wound explains the cause of death. He was hit by something Short and thin. Less than 20cm long. What kind Of tool would leave marks like this? I just don't know. Nothing matches. It's a rare kind. Knowing the tool Will be the best evidence in solving the case. Only if we knew. - Over there. - Thank you. You pig out and get a tummy like mar! Come on, chief. Lose some weight! Well, Well! Producer KANG! I'm getting old, I guess. I like sweet things. Want an egg in that? No thanks. Who did it? What? Who killed the boys on Mt. To-ap? Hey, KANG! What are you asking me that all of a sudden? That's why you're going bald. Still thinking about that? It's no one from their family or the village. I guarantee that. So then, who? According to a witness, the children had something in their pockets that day. I think it was probably bread or cookies. - Snacks? - Yeah. But where did they get the money to buy the snacks? I asked their parents and they said The boys didn't have any money. So the suspect is probably someone who knew the area well, or someone who paid the kids to meet him somewhere. So he wasn't already there and kidnapped the kids by chance, But he sent them up first, then followed them to kill them? Probably someone who knew the mountain well, or knew the kids, or who had something they liked. You know something, don't you! Don't worry, it's off the record. It was after you and the professor's commotion... After a walk around Mt. To-ap, I spotted a car parked outside Jong-ho's house. Hello? Open the window, sir. This is police. Open the window. Hey! Hey! Why did you run if you're innocent? He looked exactly like that bastard. His face. exactly the way he killed those boys! And knew Mt. To-ap inside out. But you let him go? - Not again. - What? You think we can just nail him without evidence? I Want to catch that Son Of a bitch. And kill him like he killed them, exactly the way he killed those boys! I wish I can, but I can't. YOU believe in Sixth SENSE. Why didn't you follow it? Because of his alibi. He wasn't in Daegu on that day. You can go anywhere in Korea in a few hours. He was at his WORK in Ulsan. You know What, KANG? Statute Of limitations might have expired but the investigation's not over yet. He'll be caught someday. Do you have his montage? I'll fax it to you when Find it. He knew the kids were buried in the mountain, when we dug Jong-ho's house. Then why was he loitering in the neighborhood? If he'd buried them here, he would've come here, To check on the bodies. Perhaps every year... or every month. The bodies were never moved, and the children were murdered here. It probably wasn't easy to kill 5 boys at once. What exactly happened to the children? This is Detective PARK from Eunpyung Police Station. Producer KANG would know Who I am. I'm sending in a fax for him. MT. TO-AP CASE MONTAGE OF THE FISHERMAN AT LAKE SUN-WON Sir, there's a fax for you. From Where? From Detective PARK... - Thank you. - Sure. Here's his license plate number and address. Yes? I'm looking for the owner of the car with plate no. 7406. Sorry? The driver hit my car and just left. I have his license plate number. Where is he? He left early this morning. Where is his room? There. Psychos are murdering children these days. I think he's just beginning to have fun. The police are conducting an open investigation on the two children who disappeared a week ago. The police are still investigating the case, but no evidences have yet been found. - Hello? - Seo-hyun is missing! Seo-hyun! Seo-hyun! Sorry. KANG Seo-hyun! Where were you! Why didn’t you wait inside the gates! - What happened to you here? - I fell from the swing. Are you hurt? It did at first, but now it's okay. That man helped me. Seo-hyun! Hi, Daddy. Are you okay? Where the heck were you!? - Don't hit her. - What were you doing? Get back to your work. How nice of you to drop by. What happened? She fell from a swing. Are you okay, hon? - Who tied this? - A man. EXCUSE me. Where's the man who just came this way Joo-hwan? Yes? What... does he do here? What else would he do at a slaughter house? Pardon? We slaughter cows. We kill COWS. Where is Joo-hwan? He said he'll slaughter one before going home. They're all his. He uses them every day. We use electrocution these days. Who could smash COWS in the head? But he persists on manual slaughtering. It's you. It's you, right? Who are you? You came to my daughter. Hey! You came to her, you son of a bitch! I don't know you. This is a bit rude, isn’t it? Is this how you murdered people? You think this is funny? Huh? Kidnapping my daughter And threatening me? So this is why you slaughter cows? Because you want to kill Children? You're just dying to see blood, aren't you? Maybe. It was you. YOU have evidence? November 12th, 2002 Final Hearing of Cause of Death This Can't be... Yong-deok, Yong-deok, Yong-deok, my son... I thought I would feel better if I SAW his remains. But thinking how much it must've hurt... I'm so sorry. It's not your fault. It wasn't Jong-ho. The phone call wasn't from my son. What mother can't tell her Child’s Voice? Hello? Is it you Jong-ho? Where are you? Who is it? He says he's Jong-ho. Little bastards... Honey. Yeah? Let's just say it was him. Let’s do it. It Wasn’t him... If I did that... I thought they'd find him for us... Because no one remembered our kids... We couldn’t just give up... Dad! Five children disappeared in Mt. Wa-ryong in 1991. The statute of limitations on the case expired on March 26th, 2007, and investigation and punishment of the suspect is no longer in effect. This Elm is dedicated to all those who suffered in the tragedy.
