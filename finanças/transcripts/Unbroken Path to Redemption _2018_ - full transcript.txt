The Torrance Tornado smoked the mile in four minutes, 21. 3 seconds. Zamperini is now officially the fastest high school runner in American history. This is the Green Hornet. We're going down! Mayday! Mayday! Mayday! Mr. Zamperini, good morning. Sightseeing today? No. Shall I call a taxi? There's no need. I'll walk. Do you know the way? It's not my first time in Tokyo. Mr. Zamperini? Robert Trumbull. Thank you for allowing me to join you today. I was always a fan of Time magazine. You know, my mother saw you at the Olympics in '36. She was thrilled to hear I'd be meeting with you. These men did terrible things to you. What are you gonna say to them? Where's Watanabe? Where's "The Bird"? All right, now... now can we get out of the car? Hey! Oh! Ma, Ma, Ma, Ma! You're gonna kiss me to death. I can't believe that it's you and that you're actually home. He's home, all right. We were so worried that you would be all skinny and-and worn out. Oh, what, me? No, I'm in great shape. Can you believe the army told us you were dead? Yeah, so much for military intelligence. The newspaper said they hurt you. Mom, that was just the reporter making stuff up to try and sell newspapers. Pop, you knew I was comin' home, didn't you? Yeah, of course. Of course! Of course! We all did. Mm-hmm. Let's go. Don't step on the grass! Come! Ah. You okay? Never been better. I'll see you inside. And thank you, Father, for bringing our Louie home. Amen. Ah! Hmm. On the raft, day after day, we were talking our heads off, killing time. And I was always braggin' about Ma's cooking. Yeah, and the guys, they would... They would make me describe every dish, you know, every sauce, every pinch of spice, everything, all the details, over and over again, every single day. And you know what their favorite was, Ma? What? - Your gnocchi. - Hey! What is this, Christmas? Every Christmas since you've been gone. And all your birthdays. Three years' worth. Here you go. What are these, hmm? Letters. 2,000 of them. And why are people writing me letters? They want to know if you're going to run in the London Olympics. You are a hero, Louie. They got me confused with some other fellow, Ma. - Aw. - I don't think so. - Cardarelli! - Ah, Louise. Buona sera. Buona sera. Louie! Louie, come talk to Father Cardarelli. Thank you, Mama. Mwah! Bless you, Louis. Welcome home. - Thank you, Padre. - All of Torrance was praying for your safe return. Well, that's swell. It's a miracle you survived. Miracles didn't save my tail feathers, Padre. A couple of atomic bombs did that. No. Don't discount God's role in your journey. Don't worry, Padre. I give him all the blame. Hey, Ma, they're playing our favorite song. Come on! Louis, Louis. God's not to blame for your suffering. Thanks, Padre. Hey, whoa! No! Play it again! Play it again. Louie, I have a surprise for you. It's how we found out you were still alive. Japanese have released a recording of an American prisoner they claim is Olympian Louie Zamperini. Hello, Mother. And Father. Relatives and friends. This is your Louie talking. Through the courtesy of the authorities here, I'm broadcasting this personal message to you. Turn it off. And this will be the first time in two-and-a-half years that you will have heard my voice. Turn it off. I am sure it's... Dad kept the oil changed for ya. He drove it around the block once a week. Yeah. Well, I didn't think I'd ever see this old wreck again. Hmm. It's a work in progress. You'll get it tuned up. Ah, Pete. Now you are always seein' the potential in things, you know, even your baby brother. I just made you lay off those candy bars. No. Mm-mmm. No, sir, you turned me into a running machine. But I will tell you this much. See, when those... those B-29s, they came flying over the camp, they dropped Hershey bars, you know, and I couldn't help myself. You ever see what chocolate does to your guts after a couple of years of moldy rice? It ain't pretty. Hmm. You know that Sunday Pearl Harbor happened? Yeah. I was eatin' waffles. I was on my way to the golf course. They said that we were at war, you know, but it didn't feel like war, you know? Not to me. It wasn't until I was stationed in San Diego. One day this hospital ship comes steamin' in. They were carryin' these... all these guys missin' legs and arms. They were... They were all torn up, blind, burnt. You know, that's when the war became real to me. And now they say that it's over. But any second, I just keep feeling like this... klaxon horn's gonna go off and it's "Man your battle stations." Maybe the war's not over just 'cause they say it is. Hey, come on. Let's, uh... Let's head in. It's late. Yeah, I'll be in soon. Ah, you can't help but be a big brother, can ya? It's a life sentence. Don't look at me! Rise and shine, knucklehead. Breakfast is ready. Hey, Louie. Good to have you home. Louie! Hey, welcome back, Louie. Lookin' good. - Louie! Hey! - Hey, Louie! Yeah, Mr. Louie. Oh, hi. Hey, who wants a shot on me honoring the return of Torrance's favorite son, Louie Zamperini? - To Louie. - To you! Hey, no, thanks, Reggie. He's good. Come on, what are... What are you, my shadow? You got some brass waitin' for you back at the house. Come on. I'll drive. What do they want? They're lookin' for their hero. Yeah? Sorry, guys. Duty calls, huh? To Louie! Thank you, boys. Gotta go see the brass. Sales of war bonds have taken a big dip since V-J Day. We need your help to juice things up. All you have to do is shake hands, make a little speech. -Something upbeat. -Well, I've always done most of my talking with my feet. That's a snappy way to put it. Yeah, I might be able to use that. Uh, I'd like to get a few shots with Captain Zamperini's family. Ladies and gentlemen, Louie Zamperini! I was proud to represent my country in Berlin in the 1936 Olympics, and, well, I sure am proud to represent my country here today in Philadelphia. Now, when the brass asked me to do this, I... I told them that I've always done most of my talking with my feet. Hello, Saint Louis. Those bills, well, they keep on comin' in, so I'm gonna need you to keep buying war bonds. Thank you so much for havin' me! Everyone always asks me the same question. They wanna know how do you survive 47 days on a raft in the Pacific Ocean. You talk about food. Now, I would describe to the boys how my ma would cook my favorite dishes. Well, I'd get 'em droolin'. Mmm. Mmm. Sorry about that. Uh, um... Uh, we talked... We talked about girls. Uh, Rita Hayworth. Hey, how many... how many polka dots on that swimsuit? I counted every single polka dot on that pinup. It's 89. Eighty-nine polka dots. I counted every single... You know, sometimes I wish I was one of those polka dots. He's drunk. Uh, the war might be over, but, uh... But the bills are still comin' in, so just keep buyin' those bonds, folks. Thanks. All right. "Sometimes I wish I was a polka dot." Yeah. Sorry about that. You need a snort before a speech to calm you down? I got no trouble with that. But you been getting soused in the club car on the train every night. What's goin' on with you? It's nothing. It's just hard to get a good night's sleep on the road, that's all. When you get home, I want you to go see my friend, Dr. Bailey. Right now, I'm giving you three weeks R and R in Florida. Miami Beach. Three weeks? Starting when? Soon as you can get a taxi to the station. Get yourself a suntan and lay off the hooch. That's an order. Thank you. Hey there, gorgeous. Hello. Well, I didn't know they served "I-talians" in this joint. Harry! Hey! Ha! Hey! Long time no see! It is so good to see you. Mr. Tornado himself. When'd you blow in? Just a couple hours ago. That is fantastic. Fantastic. What are you drinkin'? Uh, ginger ale. Ginger ale? What, are you trainin' for the next Olympics or somethin'? Uh, barkeep! Two Cuba Libres, por favor. Well, you don't look worse for wear. Well, you know what? I'm alive. That's all that matters. Damn right. Oh. Oh, wow. So many dames. So little time. Well, they will keep you on your toes. Yeah, I had one steppin' on my toes last night. Took this hat-check girl out for dinner. You know, steak, lobster, the whole thing. Twenty-five bucks later, she asks to use the ladies' room. I haven't seen her since. Ah, gracias. Drink up, pal. We got a lotta dolls to meet and a lotta places to see. So, there I am at the Hollywood Christmas Parade, standing outside this store. This big old cowboy rides up on this big old horse, and he says, "Hey, son, you mind watchin' my horse?" I'm like, "Sure, I'll watch your horse." I look at the saddle... Red rhinestones, "Trigger." It was Roy Rogers! I was watchin' Roy Rogers' horse. Hey, did I tell you about the time I split an ice cream cone with Lana Turner? Right down the middle. Hey, I need a little help over here, pal. Doin' all the work by myself. What are you lookin' at? Oh, wow. Be still, my heart. Good eye, Lou. We're just gon... Oh, all right. Good afternoon, ladies. You wouldn't happen to be lookin' for two he-men to round out your party, would you? Sure. Do you know where we can find any? Oh! Oh, you really know how to shoot a guy down. Oh! She got me, Lou. Tell my mother I love her. I think your friend needs medical attention. Yeah, I'm not a psychiatrist. Thanks a lot, pal. How ya doin'? You're Louis Zamperini, aren't you? Hello. Hello. I read about you in the papers, saw you in the newsreels. Well, it's nice to meet you. Cynthia Applewhite. "Do you know how to change a tire?" Oh. I turn around. It's Lana Turner sittin' on the curb, eating an ice cream cone. And I tell her, "Hey, I don't know how to change a tire." Your friend is very entertaining. He sure thinks so. When I was a kid, I lived near Torrance. You're kidding me. You still have the scars from where those runners spiked you? Yeah, they got me pretty good. Mmm. And that? Uh, Jap did that one. Thank you. For what? For preserving the free world for silly girls like me. I think it was worth it. Um... - Hey, would you like to... - Yes. What took you so long to ask? You couldn't tell? I don't know. I guess I'm a little rusty. Mmm. Do you always take girls fishing on the first date? What, your mother wouldn't approve? My mother only likes fellows I don't. She wants me to marry someone rich and predictable. You mean like that guy in the Caddy convertible? How do you know that? I saw you leaving with him. Huh. Quite the fisherman, aren't you? - Whoa! I think I got a submarine. Hey, hold on. Here we go. Just keep your rod tip up. Okay. Let your line play out. It's all right. And hold on tight. You hold on tight, or I'm gonna end up in Havana. That was so much fun. Yeah. Not bad for your first time. My arms feel like lead. What do you think it was? That is hard to tell. Maybe a redfish. Mmm. Why do the good ones always seem to get away? You know, I've been asking myself that question a very long time. A monster created by a man they called mad. Listen, I just thought that you'd be too highbrow for House of Dracula. I love monster films. I watch them all the time. Oh. Hey, you know what I love about comin' to the picture show during the day? What? Makes me feel like I'm playin' hooky from school. Just a juvenile delinquent at heart. You got that right. Halfway around the world in Tokyo, another group was tried. Japan's Pearl Harbor Premier Hideki Tojo led a list of 25 defendants accused of war crimes and atrocities. After a two-year trial, he was hanged for his acts. Brigadier General Harvey Reynolds... You thought you were free? I will never leave you. Ceremony General MacArthur expresses a wish. Let us pray that peace be now restored to the world and that God will preserve... Louie. Are you okay? Yeah. Yeah. I'm all right. I imagine it's hard to watch some of that. Come on. Let's get out of here. Did you pray while you were off fighting the war? Oh, no. No. Begging is more like it. Yeah, it's... I didn't pay much attention in mass. I pray all the time. You're a prayer answered for me. Well, you better not just be something I'm dreaming. I'm gonna be very ticked off if I wake up and you're gone. Ow! What was that for? Waking you up. See, I'm still here. Yes, you are. Ah. Come on, Tarzan! Marry me. What? In a week, I gotta go back on the road pitching war bonds, and... I'm not leaving here without you. Yeah, that sounds more like a kidnapping than a marriage proposal. You can go your whole life without ever meeting the person you're supposed to be with, but you're the one! Look, we are meant to be together. I'm not letting go. I'll race you for it. Beat me to the lifeguard stand, and I'll marry you. You know I hold the national high school record for the mile, right? Only looks like about 50 yards, and I've been outrunning boys my whole life. And if I lose? Then you lose. You ready? Come on! Right here? Yeah. On your mark. Get set. Go! You win. Well, see, I was the Tornado. Now I'm just the Torrance Tortoise. You're a great runner. You just need to get back out on the track. It means I'm past my prime. I guess I should start taking Italian lessons. That's our church. How did you know? You told me you went to Sunday school here, remember? Thank you. This whole "For better or for worse" thing and "In sickness and in health..." You mean it? You sure you wanna do this? Yeah. I'm here for you. Not the officer. Not the hero. You. I love you, Louie. - Congratulations! - Take care, lovebirds! Whoo! Have fun! Beautiful. I wonder when they're gonna fix that darn elevator. The water won't turn off. What? Oh. Here. You just gotta hunker down on it. Right. Oh! Whoa, whoa! Okay, come here. Hold that. Hold that. Hold that. Oh. Here we go. Where is it? Here it is. I got it. I got it. What's so funny? Look at you. Look at you. Come here. Come here. I know how to use this. Did I tell you... Ah, come here! You're not gettin' away. Yeah, all right. Mmm. You want to kill me? No! No, no! She cannot save you. I will destroy you both. Mr. Zamperini, Major Zeigler asked that we meet because many of our combat veterans are suffering from exhaustion and psychoneurosis. That doesn't sound like something a shot of penicillin will fix. No, I'm afraid not. These men are waking up screaming, sobbing, lashing out. Are you sleeping well? Are you having any... night sweats or nightmares? Nothing I can't handle. Look, Doc, unless you can help me find a job, I... I just don't think there's much you can do for me. What is said in here is just between you and me. Your mental health is just as important as your physical well-being. Excuse me. Hi. I'm here to apply for the delivery job. Thanks. America's best runners competed in the New York state championship with their eyes set on making the Olympic teams for the '48 games in London. Athletes from around the globe are training for their chance at the gold ring as the world turns its eyes from war to victory on the track and field. Oh, no, no, no! Oh, my... Oh, no. Oh, my goodness. Oh. I wish they'd fix that elevator. I don't trust it even when it does work. Thank you. You're welcome. I'm Cynthia Zamperini. Lila Johnson. I-I saw you movin' in. Uh, your husband is a pretty famous man. Lucky for us the landlord recognized Lou. Everywhere we went, there were nearly a hundred people on the waiting list. I'm at the end of the hall if you need anything. Thank you. You're welcome. And just drop that basket off anytime, honey. It looks like you've been running barefoot on hot coals. I have to get used to it. You know, I can't get to London with pretty feet. Are you serious? I got some old scores to settle. What's this? If you're gonna train for London, you have to do it right. We'll start at 6:30 every morning. Yes, dear. "Yes, dear." That's what husbands are supposed to say when their wives tell them to do something. "Yes, dear." Yes, dear. I thought you said 6:30. Pete says to just run a steady pace and not sprint, not until your body gets used to running again. Oh, you talked to Pete about this? Of course. I didn't know where to buy track shoes. So, just go nice and easy and see if you can make it all the way around. On your mark, get set, go! I said go. Yes, dear. Much better! But don't stop. Do another lap. Thank you, Lord. 4:09! Look out, London! You know, as I-I cross the finish line, you're mumbling something. I wasn't mumbling. I was saying a prayer. Yeah? Why? Sure seems to make a difference. You're shaving half a second off your time every day. Just 'cause I'm getting into better shape. Mmm. Mm-hmm. Come on, I'll jog a warm-down lap with you. Oh, yeah? Mmm. Come here. Hey! I'm so fast! Mmm. Smelling good, Papa. Sylvia, go check on the pie. Boys! Boys, stop. Oh! Yes, Mama. Don't hurt your brother. Yes, of course not, Mama. Be nice. So, how's the running going? - She's got me out there every morning. - Yeah? I thought you were bad. She's a taskmaster. You think you can run a 4:07 mile again? I wouldn't be doing this if I didn't. Yeah, I'm just saying you're not a kid anymore. You still think you can compete at the Olympic level? Does Lou know? He's so worried about money, finding work. I don't wanna say anything until I have to. Hey, come on. Lou bet Pete he could run a 4:07 mile. Hike! Yeah. That's fast. Aw, man. That's Louie Zamperini! Hey, guys! Hiya, Louie! Hey, fellas. What are you doin' here? I just thought I'd put some miles on this track. You goin' for a run? You can't do a 4:07 mile if you don't run. Well, can we run with you? Suppose if you like lookin' at my backside. I don't know. I was the league champ in the mile last year. Well, maybe I'll see you at the '48 Olympics in London. I'm not racing Louis Zamperini. All right, boys! On your marks, get set! Go! 4:07! Louis! Louie! We'll have another doctor take a look. There must be something that they can do. Army doc in Tokyo told me if I hurt it again, it was all over. Why didn't you tell me that? 'Cause it doesn't matter. Louie, we're supposed to be open with each other. You know, when I was a kid, I fell down some stairs. I was maybe six or seven years old, and I fell and I-I hurt myself. So I cursed. I'd get up, and son of a gun if I didn't fall... again. See, that's three times that I fell, and I remember thinking to myself... I thought so clearly that it was God. That he was doing this to me. He was tripping me up. And I just can't help but think that maybe, just maybe he's doing it again. Louie... No. No. I was doing what I was born to do. I was back on the track. It's just everything is... whole again. It's... I'm just whole again. You know, all the things, the terrible things, they just go away. It's just my heart pumping, and my... my lungs pumping, and my legs pumping. And it's necessary. I mean, do you see that? Mm-hmm. Tryin' to take it away, it's... We pushed too hard. Was that it? Is this some kind of punishment? I was standin' there at the Hollywood Christmas parade, and a cowboy comes up to me on a big horse. And I kid you not, it was Roy Rogers. Oh, there he is. Ladies and gentlemen, the late Louie Zamperini! Sorry we're late. Phil, come here. It's great to see you. It's good to see you too. This is my wife, Cecile. Call me Cecy. Everyone does. I've heard so much about you. It's lovely to finally meet you. You too. This is my wife, Cynthia. Hello. Hi. Oh! Yeah, this is Valerie. She works for Universal Pictures. - I'm just in the typing pool. - Hello. - So, what's with the limp? - Oh, it's nothing. I just, uh, tripped going down some stairs. Oh, hey, Phil was tellin' us about that crash landing you guys had in that B-24. Sounds like a whale of a tale. The only reason I'm still alive is because this guy was the best pilot in the Pacific. Here's to Harold. Yeah. - Who's Harold? - Uh, Harold Brooks. He was one of our waist gunners. He didn't make it back alive that day. Pardon me. I need to powder my nose. Would you mind goin' with Val just to make sure she comes back? - What? - What? I'll join you too. Hey. Uh, give me another round and keep 'em coming. Yes, sir. Whoa, slow down, Jack. I gotta get a little food in my belly first. Well, you could have a breadstick. Hey, how's it bein' back home in Indiana? Beats Japan. I read in the paper they can't find The Bird. Rounded up all the rest of the guards, but he flew the coop. Who? Jap prison guard. Matsuhiro Watanabe. Called him The Bird. He was the worst of the worst. Real nightmare. Hey, I just read about this ex-POW, he was headin' to work, you know, still over there. And he saw this Jap face in the crowd. Well, he gets suspicious, so he follows him, and dang if it ain't a guard from his camp. - What'd he do? - Blew the whistle on him. Now he's coolin' his heels in Sugamo Prison. Prison is too good for The Bird. Okay, okay. Okay, so I look up, and these two lovebirds... gone. Vanished, poof, right into thin air. So, about a week goes by, I see Mr. Tornado. I say, "Hey, bud. Where'd you guys go?" He looks at me, and you know what he says? "Fishing." Yeah, fishing. Can you believe that? So romantic. It's the truth, Harry. We really did go fishing. Yeah, well, I'm never gonna believe that one. - Hey, waiter. What... What is this? Sir? What is this? - It's rice, sir. - I didn't order rice. It comes with the meal, sir. Yeah, but nobody ordered rice. - Listen. - Louie. - I've had my fill of rice. - Louie, come on. Rice with dirt in it, and bugs and maggots. -What the heck is your problem? -It's all right, Lou. -It's not all right. What the heck is your problem? -He didn't know. It was a mistake, pal. Hey, don't bring stuff that people didn't order! The Bird can't get away with this. Somebody's gotta catch The Bird. Can't... get away with it. Gotta find him. Find The Bird. Come on. Get up. Gonna find him. Oh, Louie. Aah! Whoa! Hold up! You will obey me! Please! Please! Please! No! Gather here Sunday afternoon every evening to hear the word of God preached in the power of his spirit by Dr. Billy Graham to the salvation... At least eat some toast. I'm not hungry. I'm gonna call Pete. He'll know what to do. Don't... Don't call Pete. I can't do this on my own. Lookit... last night was, uh... It was just the booze. I just need to get a job. No, don't... Come on. Where are you going? To borrow Lila's phone. Look, I don't want you to call my brother! I don't want Pete knowing about it... About what? You had nothing to hide last night at the restaurant. You were acting crazy in front of everyone... I'm not crazy. I had too much to drink. Lou, let go... Let go of me! I'm pregnant. What? I'm gonna have a baby. I'm two months pregnant. Why didn't you say anything? Because I'm scared. Ever since you hurt your ankle, you're so angry. If you don't get help somehow, I don't know what I'm going to do. I'm-I'm sorry. I need more than sorry, Lou. Your physical was fine. Your lab work came back normal. In terms of helping with your inability to sleep and your emotional instability, we've had some results with hypnosis, electric shock treatment, and narcosis therapy. Narcosis therapy? We use high doses of sodium amytal and other barbiturates to help you sleep for 18 to 20 hours a day for several days. No, I... I'm sure that that works gangbusters for some guys, but that just makes me want a double scotch on the rocks. Everyone needs help at some point, Lou. Even heroes. I'm just a guy who did nothing more than survive. There's a lot of people that would disagree with that. In the prison camps, they tried to take your humanity and you wouldn't let them. And now it's our job to help you get through this. I wish you could. Hey. Hey. How'd it go? Good. Yeah, he said that I'm not alone. Does he wanna see you again? Yeah, same time next week. What's in the bag? Uh, nothin'. Just got some foot powder, toothpaste, a little bit of mouthwash. Got you a Baby Ruth. Louie? Thank you. Whoo! So, what you hopin' for, a boy or a girl? What gives? Lou? Just some trouble in paradise. I been havin' these dreams, you know? War dreams? About Watanabe. A lot? Too much. I just thought I'd be able to forget everything. You know, when we, uh, heard that your plane went down, I told Mom, I said, "If Louie can get his feet on solid ground, he's gonna be fine. We just give him a scout knife and a toothbrush, he can take care of himself." Come on. "A moment of pain is worth a lifetime of glory," remember? Come on. Once you get that kid, once you have that kid, that's gonna be the only thing inside that brain of yours. Huh? All right? - Is that so? - Oh, yeah. Is that so? Yeah? Oh, you think you've got moves, huh? I'm comin' for ya. You know, I got something in this brain. Shh, shh, shh, shh. Okay. Shh, shh, shh, shh. That's okay. Ahh. It's Cynthia. It's to honor the best part of me. Okay, yeah, all right. All right. Shh, shh, shh. That's right. Shh, shh, shh. No, no, it's okay. Shh, shh, shh. I got it. I got it. ♪ Like a diamond in the sky ♪ ♪ Twinkle, twinkle Little star ♪ ♪ How I wonder what you are ♪ Oh, Louie. It's a real honor. You know, when Harry told me you were looking for work, I said, "Lou Zamperini is just the man we need." Come on in. Have a seat. I was in the stands at SC in '38 when you set the NCAA record for the mile. What was it, four minutes and eight seconds, right? Yeah. That's right. Pleased as punch to have you in, Lou. Let's talk buttermilk. Sure. I'm retooling. I'm expanding, and powdered milk is the future of Quinn's. But first, why does the Torrance Tornado wanna be in the dairy business? I... You could work anywhere with that USC degree. I wish that were the case, Howard, but I never graduated USC. You didn't graduate? It was part of the price of goin' off to war. I see. I was under the impression that you had. See, everyone in corporate has a college degree. I could... Well, um, how are you makin' ends meet? Um, when the army thought I was dead, they cut my mother a check for ten grand. She wouldn't cash it. And when I came back alive, they let me keep it. I guess that takes the sting out of bein' dead. Yeah, I guess it does. Okay, well, you know, thank you for your time. Yeah. Good luck, Lou. Thanks. I got a five-to-one. He moves ahead in the home stretch. I got a hundred bucks in my pocket. On me, Zamp. Yeah, yeah, yeah, what happened? I got a filly in the second race... The young evangelist Billy Graham and song leader Cliff Barrows, his wife Billie Barrows, and Beverly Shea, the gospel singer, who cooperate with Christ for a Greater Los Angeles in a great revival campaign. Is he drinking again? He says he isn't, but it's a lie. Just like saying he's out looking for work every day. Have you told him you know the truth? I don't think it will make a difference. God often uses difficulties in our lives as a way of preparing us for our greater purpose. I can't tell you what to do, but I do know this. Lou is worth the fight. Sometimes I don't think I know him at all. Oh, sweetie, it takes time. It's like two trees planted side-by-side. Over the years they grow in and around each other. That's why widows like me look so odd sometimes. Sorry. I shouldn't complain. Oh. Oh, no, don't. Don't be. He had his own demons like Lou. But we faced them down together. Honey, hi, hi. This is a friend of mine. It's Fred Porter. And this is, uh... This is my wife, Cynthia. It's nice to meet ya. Cynthia? Hey, where ya been? At church. Hey, where's the checkbook? It's in my purse. Why? What was that? Oh, never mind. Just... Just give me the checkbook. God. What are you doin'? That's what I was going to ask you. Don't embarrass me like this. Why do you need the checkbook? Because I'm going into business with Fred. What kind of business? We're gonna buy surplus trucks from the army, sell 'em to the Philippines. The auction's tomorrow, so I need to give him a check, which he's gonna take to the bank first thing in the morning. How much? It's like 3,000. That's almost all the money that we have left in your life insurance. Yeah, you gotta spend money in order to make money. We're gonna make plenty of money off this deal. But what do you know about selling trucks in the Philippines? What do want me to do? You want me to pump gas? What's wrong with that? Oh, yeah, I can see that now. Hi, I'm the Torrance Tornado. Why don't you come down and I'll fill her up? Maybe change the oil. It's a fat chance. Now just give me the checkbook! No. You don't get to tell me no. That is my money, and I am the one who died for it, so give me it. You're drunk! You're drunk! You know, enough with the Saint Cynthia of Miami Beach routine. Now, you did not marry me because you thought that I would make a good gas pump jockey. I married you because I thought you were a good man! Fantastic. You got this? You're the champ. Yep, I'm doin' all right. Hollowed-out Bible. That's where I'll hide it. Jap customs agent won't mess with a Bible. Mmm. Oh, she called you? Let's go. You're comin' home with me. Oh, beat it, will ya? Well, you're not goin' back to the apartment tonight. Sylvia's staying there. Is that... Well, it's a real family reunion then. What are you gonna do with this? Huh? What are you gonna do with this? It's none of your business. None of my business? Is this none of my business too? Huh? Round-trip airfare to Tokyo? What? Are you and your little .38 plannin' a trip to Japan? Maybe we are. You're a drunk. Is this where you met your new business partner? You put up the G's and he puts up what, another round of drinks? Stay out of it, all right? I know what I'm doing. You haven't known what you're doing since you walked out of that POW camp. You need help, but you're not man enough to accept it. I'm not man enough? I'm more of a man than you'll ever be, big brother. You never got caught up in a sinking plane and almost drowned. No, you never had them hold you down, stick a needle in your arm and pump you full of garbage until you almost died, and you certainly never had The Bird punch you in the face over and over again until you almost... Now, see, you? You were on your nice, clean ship with your nice, clean sheets, eatin' your Wheaties. So, thank you for your service, sailor. Don't go back to the apartment tonight. Mm-hmm. Leave Cynthia alone. She doesn't want you there. I don't know why they keep pushing stuff like that. Look at that. It's just... Do you want to escape? I asked you a question! Do you want to escape? I wanna go home! There is no home. If you save me... There you go, buddy. On the house. Go to hell, Lou. I do every night! And what about me, huh? When you come home reeking of whiskey! Or when you don't even come home at all? I'm taking Cissy, and I'm going to Florida. What're you gonna do? You're gonna go home to your parents? And tell them how stupid you were to marry me? I can't take care of her and a drunk at the same time. So, what're you saying? I'm saying I want a divorce. It's 499 one way to Tokyo. It's only 850 round trip, so... You thought you were free. Round trip is the way to go. Don't look at me. Look at me. You are nothing. You thought you were free. You are nothing. You are nothing. You... Don't... are nothing... Look at me... Lou? You... Lou. Are nothing. Did I get your attention? I'm, uh... I'm going out. Lila asked me to go to the revival, so... Well, hide your wallet. The circus is in town. You could come too. He's supposed to be different. Not like the old revival shows. Maybe he could help you. Look at me. Look at me. This is why I should bow down to God, to thank him for what I am? I mean, don't you get it? God is my enemy. It's okay. Lou, I know about the whiskey bottle in the toilet tank. And the one under the sink. You can't have the life you had before the war, so you've given up on this one. On me, on Cissy, on your family. You're not going to Japan. You're not gonna kill The Bird. It's a dream. It's a sickness. It's okay. Tonight our message is gonna be brief. Now, I always say that. So I don't want you to get too hopeful, okay? This is the Green Hornet. We're going down. Mayday! Mayday! Mayday! There's a lifeline, and that's the hand of Jesus to hold onto. I do not believe that any man, that any man... without Jesus Christ. Your tremendous marital problems, your physical problems, your financial problems. Help! There are problems of sin and habit that cannot be solved without the person of our Lord Jesus Christ. Have you trusted Christ Jesus as savior? Tonight I'm glad to tell you that the Lord Jesus can be received, your sins forgiven... your burdens lifted, your problems solved by turning your life over to him and repenting of your sin and turnin' to Jesus Christ as savior. Louie, wake up. Louie. Louie. Louie, shh. Cissy's asleep. I love you. And I will not divorce you. You can leave Cissy. She's staying with Lila. But you and I could go together. I don't know any other way to help you, Louie. Please come with me. Please. Just say, "Yes, dear." Yes, dear. ♪ Take it to the Lord In prayer ♪ ♪ Do thy friends despise Forsake thee ♪ ♪ Take it to the Lord In prayer ♪ ♪ In his arms ♪ ♪ He'll take and shield thee ♪ ♪ Thou wilt find A solace there ♪ ♪ Amen ♪ Good evening. Not what you expected? The eighth chapter of John will be our reading tonight, if you have your Bibles. And we begin reading. Jesus went unto the Mount of Olives. And early in the morning he came again into the temple and all the people came to him, and he sat down under the cover of darkness. But let me tell you something. Darkness does not hide the eyes of God. God takes down your life from the time you were born to the time you die. And when you stand before God on that great judgment day, you're gonna say, "Lord, I'm not such a bad fellow." Then they're gonna pull down the screen and they're gonna show the moving picture of your life, and you're gonna hear every thought that was goin' through your head of every minute of every day, and every second of every minute. And your own thoughts, your own deeds, are gonna condemn you as you stand before God on that day. And here tonight, there's a drowning man, a drowning woman, a drowning boy, and a drowning girl, all lost on the sea of life, not knowin' which way to turn, but just looking... Just looking for some type of hope for the future. I don't care how dark or how perplexing your problems might be. It makes no difference. Every problem solved, every sin washed away. Just reach out and take the hand of Jesus. I want everyone to bow their heads and close your eyes. I'm sorry. Are you afraid, Lou? It's not gonna hurt you. You're not happy the way you are. You want to change. You know, when he says, "All heads bowed, all" whatever? Eyes closed. Yeah. Well? See, they gotta be. Now, you wanna know why? You know, when I was a kid... and I went to those crummy, lying revivals? I kept my eyes open... and so I got to see all the pickpockets who were stealing from the chumps. Okay, here's a story. It's set in the future. Cissy is 15. She has her first boyfriend. He's a good-lookin' kid, comes from a nice family. She brings him home one day and doesn't tell us. They come through the door and there you are, too drunk to remember that you're supposed to hide in the bedroom so that nobody sees you. Instead, you start showing him your notebooks. Naturally, the kid tries to get away, but you hang on breathing alcohol in his face. And your daughter, the light of your life, the little baby that you wouldn't let anybody else touch... she is so ashamed of her father that she wants to die. Why, you ask yourself, why is God silent while good men suffer? Why doesn't he stop the pestilence? Why doesn't he stop the wars? Why doesn't he stop the suffering in this world? Well, that is the question that has mystified people from generation to generation. If you look into the heavens tonight, on this beautiful California night, I can see the stars and I can see the footprints of God. And I say to myself, "My father, my heavenly father, he hung them there with his flaming fingertip... Yes. And he holds them there by the power of his omnipotent hand." Amen. What God asks of men is faith. You can't see him, you can't hear him. God makes himself unseen. But I believe that God is still performing miracles. Amen! I believe that God is still healing bodies. I believe that God is still healing hearts. I believe that God is still transforming lives. Amen. And he says to each of us, "If you suffer, I'll give you the grace to go forward." But because you can't hear him, because you can't see him in his silent of heaven... Amen. You turn away from him. And let me tell you, brother, that's the most dangerous place to be, to sit there day after day, and never accept salvation. Amen. Hardening your soul day after day, night after night, until it's too late. Yes. That God cannot even reach into your heart of hearts and save you from yourself. Amen! I want everyone to bow their heads, close your eyes. Lou. Don't leave! You can leave while I'm preaching, but not now. If you save me... Look at me. Look at me. No. Look at me. Look at me! This is it. God has spoken to you. It is time. Come on. If you save me... I will serve you forever. He kept me alive... through everything... for this. The war is over. Where's Watanabe? Where's The Bird? We're pretty sure he's still alive. We will keep lookin' for him, Captain. Then do me a favor. If he ever turns up... will you give him this for me? Tell him to take a look at Matthew, chapter six, verse 14. "For if you forgive other people when they sin against you... your heavenly father will also forgive you." It's okay. It's okay. It's over. It's over. It's gonna be okay. I forgive you. I forgive you. God bless you. It's okay. Okay? Hai. God bless you. It's okay. It's okay. I forgive you. God bless you. God bless you. It's okay. I forgive you. It's over. I forgive you. It's okay. God bless you, sir. During the war, Louis Zamperini was an American war hero. He was 47 days on a life raft floating around in the Pacific. And he began to drink when he came home, and he was confused and frustrated and mixed up in his life. And he, too, wandered into that tent on Washington and Hill in Los Angeles and found Christ as his savior. And tonight he is the director of the Victory Boys Camp for juvenile delinquents in Los Angeles, giving his full life now to try to rehabilitate juvenile delinquents and lead them to a knowledge of Jesus Christ. Louis, we're delighted to have you with us tonight. Thank you, Billy. It was after the war and with about $10,000 in back pay from two and a half years in prison camp and also, uh, collecting my life insurance for being dead, I became extremely selfish, cynical, and greedy until the, uh, wind was finally let out of my sails. I lost everything that I possessed outside of my wife and little girl, and it was then that my wife was able to persuade me into going down to that meeting. I asked the Lord Jesus Christ to come into my heart and save me. And, of course, he did. ♪ I was looking for an answer ♪ ♪ For a way to stop the pain ♪ ♪ When you came to me With healing ♪ ♪ I was looking for a fix ♪ ♪ When you broke these chains ♪ ♪ What a beautiful feeling ♪ ♪ I was looking for a way Back home ♪ ♪ When I found healing ♪ ♪ For my wounded heart ♪ ♪ I found mercy In your open arms ♪ ♪ I found freedom When you set me free ♪ ♪ I found myself When you found me ♪ ♪ When you found me ♪ ♪ I was runnin' reckless ♪ ♪ When you found me ♪ ♪ Now I'm runnin' home ♪ ♪ When you found me ♪ ♪ Yeah, I finally found My redemption ♪ ♪ You found me And you made me whole ♪ ♪ Yeah, I didn't know That I'd been missing ♪ ♪ Till you found me ♪ These are kids that quit high school. They haven't accomplished anything. So I have a chart that all during the week they gotta pass everything, boating... And I get 'em up on the top of the mountain and teach them glacial survival and rescue, so that at the end of the week I show the kids... "Look at the things you've accomplished all week. They weren't easy. It shows that you can accomplish anything you want. Now, you go back and finish your time and then go back and get your high school diploma and that's the first big accomplishment of your life." While I was still on my knees, my life changed in a matter of moments, because I knew I was through getting drunk, and I knew that I forgave my guards, and I knew it was a miracle because I forgave The Bird. And that was the first night, first night in two and a half years I didn't have a nightmare, and I haven't had one since. Forgiveness must be complete. Uh, no matter who the person is. And I've had a few enemies, even the last few years, and the only way I can forgive 'em is to pray for 'em, and that's what I do. Instead of hatin' 'em I pray for 'em. You just have to buckle up and go onto greater things. The guy says, "Aren't you... Aren't you the guy that spent 47 days on a raft?" I said, "Yeah." He says, "You're entitled to travel pay." I said, "What?" He said... That's a very efficient guy. He said, "Seven dollars and 60 cents a day times 47." He made out a bill, mailed it to Washington, and a week later we got a response, and it said, uh, "Request denied.
