So you gonna go out for the track team this year? I can't. My dad's making me play jv football. But they're not even the same season. You can go out for both. He wants me to bulk up. He started making me drink these puke-in-the-glass protein drinks. And he said there's more college scholarships for football than for track. Cam, I thought we were gonna stick together throughout high school. Maybe I wanna play football. So you're still coming with me to that party tomorrow night, right? No. I got stuff to do. You always have stuff to do. Well, it's true. Bull. You're coming. I'm just not into that stuff anymore. Uh-huh. I see how it is. Don't take it the wrong way, dude. Dude, I'm not letting you off the hook. You're still going. See you later, losers! Hut, hut, hut! Hey, guys, you linemen, come here. Hold on. Guys? All you lineman, if someone's coming at you, if he's coming at you low and you notice he's low, bring him on down and come on past him, okay? Come on, somebody hit him! Let's go. Running play. Hey, you gotta hang onto that ball, okay? You know that hit is coming. All right? Keep it in your gut. Hang onto the ball. Here we go. Bring it in. All right, let's go. Hustle up. Hustle up! All right, everybody, take a knee. Bring it in! Get some water. Now, I have zero doubt in my mind that this team is capable of winning district this year, not to mention state as well. All right! In fact, I expect it. That's right! And I know that you'll achieve this goal with both character and honor. Now, I've learned from my many years of coaching, some of you guys, all the way back to pop warner, that no student athlete can succeed without the involvement and the encouragement of his parents. And each one of these envelopes that stu's gonna hand out contains a copy of the team contract. Please note that both player and parent must sign. Go ahead and take a moment to look it over. Now, you all know my son cam here. I think he'll attest to the fact that I play no favorites. Yes, sir. Now, the team code states what's expected from you guys both on and off the field. Bottom line, for the next four months, this team and these coaches will rule your lives. If you're single-minded, you can achieve this goal with purpose. It's gonna take guts, hard work, and a lot of determination. Am I clear? Yes, sir. Let me hear it! Yes, sir! Louder! Yes, sir! Everybody go hit the showers. All right! Go! Don't forget to get those contracts signed. Nobody practices without a team contract signed. Gimme a water, will you? Got it. Do we have to hear that same pep talk every year? Stop complaining. I listen to it every morning. You comin' tonight? Thought I might stop by. All right. Party! Good work, guys. Hey, man, warlock won't go through the magician's door. You gotta catch these little elf dudes. Get enough for two lives so you can lose one, and can still get inside. ♪ Yo, vato, come on. I kinda told brandon we'd hang out. Not really going to the movies. Change of plan. Party, strictly hush-hush. Ah, man, you go... I gotta run intervals in the morning. I'll run 'em with you. You really wanna play video games with a 12-year-old? It beats spendin' it with you. Get in the car! John, when will you be back? Don't worry, mrs. Van horn. I'll have him back as soon as the movie's over. Great. Now you're lying to my mother. Oh, just a little one. Come on, honey. It's time to come inside. Brandon. Come on. So where's the party? It's a secret. It's a need-to-know basis only. Funny. So I need to know. Why? So you can bail out like you usually do? I'm here, aren't I? When'd you turn into such a boring guy? I'm sorry. I didn't mean that. Really, I-I don't get it. I'm doin' something with my life that you wouldn't understand. How could I if you don't tell me? Trust me, you wouldn't. We used to share everything. We were kids, cam. We still are kids! We got the rest of our lives to get serious. Maybe I don't wanna wait. The party's at schrunk's old man's moving company? Yeah. So? Pass. Oh, come on! Okay. We'll pop our heads in, say a few what ups, stay an hour, tops. Cam home? He can unload the rest of this, then. He went to the movies with john. What are they seeing? Please. He's 17 years old. You didn't ask? I didn't ask. Well, how do you know they're at the movies? I trust him? Hello? Hey, gary, it's me. Hey. Hey, look, I think you might have a situation. Can you meet me in the high school parking lot? Okay, give me five minutes. See you soon. That was boscow. Got a little team recon to do. I thought we were gonna have dinner together. Well, you can just leave me something. You get hungry, you can cook it yourself. What's the problem? I'm just making sure that my guys are where they should be. It's not enough for you to run your own son's life? They're my responsibility, diane, on and off the field. Hi, guys. Hi! What's up? Check out schrunk's hermana. Nikol? She's a freshman. Who facebooked me last night, and wanted to know if we could hook up. You're on your own, buddy. An hour, cam. Yep. Hey. Hello. You're pretty skinny. I'm a runner. The less you weigh, the faster you run. So you're fast? At everything? What do you mean? How fast can you talk? I got like 20 seconds of video on this thing. Okay, wing boy. Ready, set... talk. Hey. Hey back at ya. So what's the intel on the team? You got a 1020 for your boy? He's at the movies with john van horn. Oh. Sorry, man. Dude, what is your problem? Well, how much longer? I don't know. Unlike you, I don't run every aspect of my life with a stopwatch. Dude, you said an hour. Are you serious? Fine, dude, I'll get my own way home. Chill out! You know, the only reason you asked me to come was you needed an alibi for your old man. You used me. Now I'm outta here. Oh, god, john... what, are you gonna run home? It's pitch black in the middle of nowhere! Please don't do this! I got a call from a private security guy. Says there are a lot of cars parked outside of schrunk's moving and storage, loud music. Schrunk? His kid's my biggest lineman. I got another call to check out. That should give you enough time to get there first and round up everybody before I come in, wave my badge and breathalyzer. Thank you. ♪ Keys. Now. ♪ Hey, what are you doing? Football players! Give up your car keys. And then take a seat on the bus outside, no exceptions. Everybody stay put. Pedestrian versus car. It's not pretty. The driver says he never saw him until it was too late, that the kid ran across the road in front of him. Gary... the vic is john van horn. No. Oh... no. Oh, god! No, no... I'm sorry. I know. Come on, let these guys do their job. Oh, no, dad! I know. It's... I know who it is. Come on. Come on, come on, boscow's got some questions. Oh... oh! Come on, hang in. Cam, as he drinking tonight at that kegger? Now, he was there with you? No! No way. He... he doesn't drink. He... he didn't even wanna go. I made him. Tell 'em he's packaged and ready for transport. Let's go, on my marker. Let's get movin'. Thank you. Yes. Dr. Grant called me about the ekg results. We just want to get them down here as soon as possible. Dr. grant. That's correct. Thank you so much. We'll see you soon. Brandon. Mrs. Van horn... brandon! John still hasn't regained consciousness. Want some junk food, buddy? I'm buying. Come on. Come on. We have tried to relieve the pressure on his brain. Whatever you want. My favorites are the peanut butter and cheese crackers. Did you get hurt in the accident too? No, I just, uh... I just gave some blood. I'm what they call a universal donor. John needs your blood? Um... no, I... I just wanted to do something, you know? Pretty lucky to be in the same car and not get hurt. Um... brandon, we weren't together. So we'll just keep you posted, ma'am. Brandon, come sit with me! What can I do, mrs. Van horn? I gotta do something. I can't just... You can go home. I am so... sorry. He's in god's hands now. You didn't answer your phone. The battery must have run out of juice. I been lookin' all over for ya. Jerri didn't want me around. She asked me to leave. Can you believe that? Let's get you home. She'll let us know how he's doing. I'm so sorry about your friend, cam. I promised him we'd stay an hour, and I lied to him. Just like I lied to mom about the movies. And then I bailed on him when he wanted to leave. What kind of friend would do that? Well, I'm the last one to cut you any slack, you know that. I'm not saying what you did wasn't wrong, but he could have called his mother to come pick him up. Yeah, right, like that would have happened. Well, you would have called me to come... aw, get real, dad. You're the last person I'd call. Hey. No, he's here with me. I-I found him at the stadium. Okay. We're heading home now. I'm not goin' home. I wanna be there when john gets out of surgery. He's out of the e.r., cam. I just talked to your mother. How is he? He never regained consciousness. No. Dad, don't say that. He's gone, cam. I'm so sorry. Thinking about john, what am I gonna miss? I've been the track and field coach at kennedy high for almost ten years now, and john was the fastest runner I ever coached. He had enormous physical talents, which, combined with his tenacity and desire, turned him into a champion. Certainly for me as a coach, he was a... a once-in-a-lifetime young man. But what I'll really miss is john van horn, the person. I miss you already, john. We all miss you. This is from job. "The farthest limit he searches out." That best describes john better than anything I've ever read. We were friends for as long as I can remember. He was over at my house so much, my parents called him john stiles, and his mother called me cam van horn. We were like brothers. For john, running was like a religion. Well, that stadium may seem like an oval track with steel bleachers to most of us. To him, it was like walking into a church. It's where he found god. I envied him that. I depended on him. But today... I just feel completely lost. I'll never forget you, john. Never. I know I can't replace your brother, brandon... but I'm here for you. Is he going to school? He says he's not ready yet. This'll get him up and going. He's depressed, gary, not undernourished. Feed the body, feed the mind. He lost his best friend. I think he needs to see somebody. What are you talking about, a shrink? He needs help. I think he needs to be evaluated. I don't know, I mean, if... if the scouts found out he's got emotional problems, it could really hurt him. I don't care. I want what's best for him, not next season, not next year. Now. Right now. Okay. I'll talk to him. Hey. Breakfast of champions. Well, I'll see you after school then. Nobody's home! Somebody doesn't answer in the first hundred rings, probably 'cause they're busy! I knew you were here 'cause I heard you say you weren't. It's not a really good way to make people go away, you know? Sorry. How you doin'? My mom's telling me to be normal, and I have to go to school. How come your parents don't make you? They're trying. Probably have to go tomorrow. I, uh, found this in my brother's pocket. He had this at the party? What is it, his diary? I think so. What does that equation on the cover mean? It's time equals distance over speed. It's his training log. He was trying to run a 4-minute mile. That's crazy. Why?'cause it's almost impossible. Especially for a high school kid. He was fast. Faster than anyone. Yeah, he was. Do you think he felt pain? He was a great person and... god knew that and wouldn't let him suffer. They say that every morning in africa an antelope wakes up. It knows it must outrun the fastest lion, or it will be killed. Every morning in africa, a lion wakes up. It knows it must run faster than the fastest antelope or it will starve. It doesn't matter whether you're a lion or an antelope, because when the sun comes up, you'd better be runnin'. It's not easy, I know, but we've all been through it. When your grandmother died, it tore me up. But you have got to start thinking about your life and stop thinking about john's death. What if I can't? Well, what are your options? You gotta put one foot in front of the other and just keep on movin', and pretty soon... you'll be right where you wanna be. Wish it was that simple. Listen, when you go down to the field, you may have butterflies in your gut before the kickoff, but you know enough not to show it to the other team. That's the way you get through life. I'll try not to embarrass you with the team on friday. Blue 53! Blue 53! Left. Watch the left. Watch... watch him. Watch him. Blue 53! And hut! Motion, motion! Hut! Pick him up, mitchell! Watch your tight end! Get in line! Get in line! Aah! Hey, stafford, get in there. Blue, come on out! That's good form, man. That's good form. Line it back up, gentlemen! What the heck's he doing? Potoff! Yeah. Go get him. What do you want me to say? Just get him back on the field! Cam? Dude, you in here? I'm sure he will. Thank you.yes. Uh, mr. And mrs. Stiles? Hi. I'm dr. Aldicott. I'm cameron's assigned psychologist. Why does he need a psychologist? Well, in cases like these with teenagers, hospital protocol requires them to do a psychological evaluation. Doctor, I know him better than anyone else, and what happened out there today with my son is that he lost his temper. It's football. It's an emotional game. That may be so. Rational people don't put their fists through glass windows. No, they don't, but my son just lost his best friend in a terrible accident, so I think that it's understandable. What he needs to do is to pick himself up, get focused, and move past this. But doing that may take some time, mr. Stiles. Cameron suffered a severe traumatic loss. He needs to grieve in a way that makes sense for him. We will give him all the time he needs. He's a tough kid. He'll get through this. I'm sure he will. If you'll excuse me. He's gonna be fine. Well, cam... what were you thinking about when you put your hand through the window? I wasn't thinking. I was in pain and... I only succeeded in giving myself more of the same. Listen, sweetie, everything is going to be fine. You're hurting, and you miss john, and that is nothing to be ashamed of. Why did you come here? Dad tell you to come and buck me up and get me back out on the field? That is not fair. Life's not fair, right? There's no room for self-pity. Losers whine, winners suck it up. It's all up here. You gotta focus, gotta focus. Shh, cam, stop. You gotta own and take control of the game. You gotta push through and suck it up. Cam, please, stop! Victory over self, over life, over my... stop. John was very important to all of us. We all miss him. The difference between us... is that I caused his death. And I gotta live with that... for the rest of my life. Red, 99! Red, 99! It's a blitz! Hut, hut! Watch the linebackers! Ah, come on! Potoff, come here, come here! What is wrong with you, son? If you touch it, you catch it! I got my laces messed up, coach. You don't catch with your feet. Now get out there and play some football. Catch it with your hands! Why are you sitting here in the dark? He's so angry, gary. It just tears me up that I can't just pick him up and hold him and make it all better. Maybe it's more than john's death. What do you mean? Maybe being pushed so hard... is too much for him. Well, you've always thought that I pushed him too hard. Don't you? Honey, if it were another coach, he would push him just as hard, if not harder. I'm not talking to his coach. I'm talking to his father. Cam told me today that life's not fair, losers whine, winners suck it up, and you keep telling him to get a grip and move on, and he doesn't know how to do that. What do you want me to do? Try being his dad. I love him very much, you know. Then you need to tell him that. I did this. If it wasn't for me, he'd still be alive. You didn't force him to run home, cam. You're not trying to make this out to be john's fault, I hope. I should have driven him home like I promised. Okay, you made a mistake, and it was a bad one. Listen. Just because john is dead doesn't mean you can't be angry with him. I'm not! I'm mad at myself. At some point, you're gonna have to make peace with this, cam. You held out on me. You were going for sub-4 and you kept it a secret. Why didn't you tell me? ♪ Oh, hey, see you later. See ya. Hey, cam. How was rehab? See any celebs in there? It wasn't rehab, allie. It was just a hospital. Sounds boring. I'm glad you're back. Thanks. Hut... hut! Hut! Love that ball! Okay, bring it in! Let's go! Take it in, guys. Get some water. Take a break. Cam, come here. Cam stiles didn't show up today. You seen him around? Cam! Cam, come back here! All right, let's get back to work. I said, let's go! You gotta work on that audible. Hey. What's that? Ah, just... something for school. Did you have a nice talk with your dad? Yep. He's quite the motivational speaker. Oh. Sweetie. That's just the way he is. He can't change it, and you can't change him. Believe me, I've tried. But he loves you very much. You know that, don't you? You just get better. That's all that really matters. You gotta get up early for school tomorrow, so... don't stay up late. I love you. I love you too. Good night. I got it, I got it! Nate, nate, I'm open, man! Hey! Oh! Get it, get it, get it. Come on, now! Going down, man. Hey. Hey. Been lookin' all over for you. I've just been hanging out here. Hey, aren't you supposed to be at football practice? I knocked off early today. Brandon, i-i wanna ask you something. Go for it. You don't even know what I'm gonna say. Yeah, I do. The sub-4. Do it for john. I don't know... do it for my brother. You're up early. Is dad comin' down? Yeah, he's on his way. Is something wrong? No. I just... wanted to talk to you. Cam... has something to say to us. If it's about yesterday, I have something to say too. It is. You might wanna sit down, because this is gonna affect you most. I'll stand. I'm quitting football. Listen, cam... you stumbled, and now you're down. All you have to do is get back on the field. The scouts understand that. I talked to usc last night. I told them you were injured for a couple of games, but now you're back 100%. They're coming to the hillsborough game on friday night. I'm not playing. I need to train. Train for what? I'm gonna run a 4-minute mile. That is impossible. And incredibly dumb. It's not even your sport! I gotta try anyway. Cam, come back here. Let's talk about this. There's nothing to talk about, dad. I made up my mind. Maybe this is a good thing... getting motivated about something. This is not a good thing, honey. He's blowing his college scholarship! We'll find another way to pay for college. How? We'll get a loan. Cam can get student loans. You know what you get on one of those things? About 2,000 bucks, unless we cosign. And we've already got two mortgages. Where are we gonna get a loan? This friday's game is the loan. I appreciate your passion and your interest, cam, but you just don't have the base. I used to run with john all the time. I was his rabbit on the third and fourth lap. I got a lot more base than you think, coach. Maybe, but... a sub-4 isn't a realistic goal. Cam, it takes runners years to prepare for something like that. Alan webb ran a sub-4 in eugene, oregon, when he was still in high school. Alan webb was paced by college runners. So it's not impossible. You know what, there isn't even a level of competition in high school these days. The mile isn't even run around here anymore. All the glory now's in sprints or distance. John wanted to run the golden west mile. I know that for a fact. He wrote it all down, everything. A man with a plan. Now it's my plan. Cam... you wanna try out for track in the spring? We'd be glad to have you. No! I gotta get started now! Have you even talked this over with your dad? Mentioned it. Oh, you mentioned it. I'm sure he was thrilled. What did he think? It doesn't matter! Look, I've been training all my life... Mountain biking, soccer, swimming, youth track. I'm being scouted as a wide receiver 'cause I'm fast. Now, I just wanna make a change. I wanna use all that training and the mental conditioning from my dad, and I wanna run a mile in under four minutes. Cam, running a mile is an art form. It requires speed and stamina. You might have the speed, but do you have the stamina? I don't think so. If I don't, then I'll get it with your coaching. Okay. You show up here tomorrow after class, ready to run like you've never run before. We'll see. Thanks. I said we'll see. Stay in your lane. Keep it loose, guys. Good hit, good hit. Move on speed. Ready! All right, cam. These gentlemen are all running the middle distances for us come this spring, so they'll give you something to measure yourself against. No pressure. Probably coming from over there. Missed it. Let's just do it. Take the line. Go again. Work harder, gentlemen! All right, gentlemen, take the line. Four laps. Ready? Runners on your marks. Get set. Go! Come on, keep those feet moving! Coach. Take over. You're not making this easy on me, leo. 63! He's fast. We always knew that. You know, once this little demonstration is over, you gotta set him straight. He's not gonna get into college unless he's got a football scholarship. He sure as hell isn't gonna get in running track. You told me to treat him like any other kid, gary. No special treatment because you're the a.d. I said that? Yes, you did. It'd be the first time you ever listened to me. 66! Well, I'll tell you what. He went out too fast, but he's got a lotta natural talent. Yeah, that I need back as a wide receiver on my field. Check him out, man. Well, there's your answer, leo. He doesn't have a sub-4 in him. Don't get up. Give yourself a few seconds. It'll get easier. It's not supposed to be easy, coach. Well, now that we got that out of your system, let's get you back with the team, start getting you ready for friday. When are you gonna stop telling me what to do? You got game, son, just not this one. I wanna train with the cross-country team. Well, that's not going to happen. It's my decision, okay? Not yours. You're gonna have to deal with it. No, you deal with it! I want you in that locker room and back in your... Okay, gary, gary... stay out of this, leo. This has nothing to do with you. Are you talking to me now as an a.d. or as a parent? I am talking to him! Let me handle this my way! Then I think I need to remind you that the policy of the athletic department as determined by the athletic director, which is you, is to deny parents who are out of control access to student athletes. You need to walk away, gary. Now. Think about it. If you don't walk away, this will go to the school board. You preach self-control, now practice it. What are you doin', man? Come on! Come on back to the team, man! Let's do this, man. Get back to it. Okay, guys, hit the showers. Thanks a lot. Hey, cam. It's harder than you thought, huh? Just stick to the plan. Don't worry about it. Your dad'll understand. We are gonna finish what you started. You made a commitment, and there are people depending upon you. You will not quit. Do you understand? I'm not gonna talk to you till you chill out. Don't tell me to chill out! Until you're 18 and out of this house, you're gonna live by my rules! Dad, either you please leave my room now or I will. We are going to work this out. Okay. You stay. Listen to me. You are notrunning away from this. Would you two stop? Stay out of this, diane. I will not. He's my son too. Cam has a decision to make. He's either playing football, or he's not. Try not. Then if you're not playing ball, then there's no other team that has a place for you. And that is coming from the a.d. of the school, not your father... is that clear? I guess I'm on my own team then. He doesn't want to play football. What don't you get? He doesn't know what he wants. And you do? He's a teenager, gary. You fought your father. I fought mine. 'S all a part of growing up and becoming a man. Cam was about 12 when we were practicing curl patterns in the park. It's gettin' dark, and he wants to go home, and I won't let him still he catches ten in a row without a drop. So I keep throwin' and he keeps hookin' and catchin'. We actually got it up to nine. Now it's so dark, we can barely see. Cam's on the verge of tears. But I ride him. I ride him. Gotta catch all ten. Can't quit till you get ten in a row. Eventually... he got the ten, but it was a long night. What were you trying to prove, just that he could do it? I don't want him to be me. I got a house and a mortgage I can barely keep up with. Yeah, but you've had a lot of success as a football coach. But I'm only as good as my players. So I push, and I push hard. And every once in a while... I get a great player who was born to play the game, like cam... who also happens to be my son. So I push even harder. You had a dream for him. Had his future all mapped out. Yeah. But it was your dream, gary, and your future, not his. 68, 71, and 66. Not bad for city blocks. It's not good enough. Well... try to keep up. What are you doing? Finding myself some obstacles! What took you so long? What... what... how did you... I knew you were comin' to my house, 'cause you used to come with john. Brandon, come over here. Stay here. Brandon. You knew about this, right? No. I'm real sorry, mrs. Van horn. I thought you signed off on it. Really, cam? What makes you think I'd trust the only son I have left within a mile of you? Just don't give up, cam. No matter how hard it gets, don't quit! Hey, cam, you're up early. You been running? More than I ever thought possible. I'm even running in my sleep. So who's training you? John. I mean, I been using his book. Mm. Got a mile time? Well, I ran 4.11 solo on the track last weekend. You ran a 4.11? For real? Yeah. Well, that's a great time. You just might get that sub-4 in college. See, coach... i can't wait that long. Without a football scholarship, I may never make it to college. You got anybody who can beat me now? Like I told you before, nobody around here. But there is a pretty amazing kid who lives over in riverside. The exchange student from somalia? Mm-hmm. Keflezi? Yep. John was looking forward to beating him. I really need this, coach. All right, here's the deal. Fast or not, I don't need your mental baggage on this team. So you bring that instead of your speed, and I will send you packing. No arguments. Clear? Absolutely. Well... then I would be certifiably crazy not to have a 4.11-miler on my team. Welcome aboard. Thank you, coach. Thank you so much. All right. Thanks. All right, runners, take your marks. Get set. Go! 4.16. 4.18. Go. It's only pain, stiles. That's all you're gonna eat? Yeah. I still gotta lose some more weight. You sure you don't want some pizza? Uh-uh. No. No. Thanks. Well, she can't make it, so I guess we'll just push the meeting till thursday. Go make peace with him. Hey, dad. What's up? Just wanted to say hi. Cam, I think you're making a terrible mistake. Well, it's not about you. No, you're right, cam. It's about you. It's about sticking with something and seeing it through, no matter how hard it is. What do you think I'm doing now? I don't know what you're doing, and I don't think you do either. I've played football since pop warner. Ten years of football and nothing else. I-I tried to please you. I tried to make you happy, dad. I really did. But I can't do it anymore. And I'm finally doin' something now that I wanna do, and I feel really good about it. Why can't you get that? Aren't you coming in? I thought I'd wait till the crowd got a little bigger. You don't want cam to see you. Well, I'm here. Let's leave it at that. It would please him a lot, gary, to know you were watching, rooting for him. Please let me handle this my own way, diane. Okay. It's worked so well before. Let's not start, okay? Cam have a shot, you think? Probably ends here. Needs to place first or second for the golden west invite. You wanna sit together? I'm okay here. Just stay on his shoulder, okay? Help me, john. Help me do this. I can do it with your help. Four laps. Just four laps. On your mark... set... Come on, cam. Come on, cam. Not too fast. Just stay with him. Keep the tank full. This isn't too bad. Pace is good. Great job, great job. Hold your pace. Hold your pace. That can't be his pace. He's trying to psych me out, that's all. Don't let him. Don't let him. Coach said stay with him, so I'm staying with him. Yeah, it's me. Surprise. Didn't think I'd be with you, huh? Go, cam! If I stay here, he wins. Gotta get inside... now. Here goes, pal. Bye-bye. Sayonara. Stay with him. Back the hell off, man. Give me room. Give me room. Come on, go! Go! Whoo! Go! Come on, cam, take him! Did I do that, or did he just trip? He looked hurt. Did I hurt him? Forget him. Just run. Come on, dig! Dig, dig, dig, dig, dig! Yes! Yes! 4.04.53. Hey, hey, hey. 4.04.53. Great. Great. Walk. Walk. Walk. I'm gonna check on the foul, all right? There might be a foul. Don't get too excited, all right? Hey, man, I didn't mean to do that. That was an accident. The leg was mine! You knew you could not defeat me! What? That's ridiculous! That is what happened. Everybody saw it. So I tripped you on purpose? It is the only way you could ever beat me! I would have beaten your dead friend too... Maybe even worse than you. Hey, leave him out of this. I beat him today. I'll beat him tomorrow. Had you not tripped me, you would know it as well! Okay. Hey! Cam, cam! It's over with! Hey! Walk away! Cam! Cam! I'm gonna get back on the road. See ya, cam. Don't be in such a rush to move in out here. Boscow says he's been seeing your car out here at night. You been sleeping out here? Once in a while. I'm always back before you guys get up. Well, it'll be our secret. Thanks. You hungry? So emory got the automatic? Yep. And keflezi got the last bid based on his time in the split, so... I'm out. Well, you didn't give them much choice. I know. It was dumb. Well, I'll take my share of the responsibility for setting a bad example. You didn't hit him. Hey, I practically decked leo for letting you try out for his team. You know, for leo to have runners like you and van horn, even emory just fall into his lap... I don't know. Maybe I was just jealous. Putting me up there with a lot of great runners. Hey, you ran a 4.4 at 1,600 with a stumble in the last lap, and you did it without proper rest. Imagine what you might have done with a good night's sleep, in a bed. Oh, and something else I wanted to tell ya. I called the golden state board, and I asked 'em for an appeal. Really? What'd they say? Well, don't get your hopes up, but we got a meeting on thursday afternoon. Thanks for doing that for me. Well, I did it for myself as well. I think we both deserve a second chance. Hey! Get up. What? It's saturday. I don't have school. You're goin' running. Now? Yeah, now, it's 7:30. We're missing the best part of the day. We? I'm goin' too. Think you can beat the old man? Well... there's only one way to find out. First one back to the house? You're on. You were holding out on me. No, I wasn't. Yeah, you were. Yeah, you were! Yeah, you were! No, I wasn't. No. No, you're fast. Good run. Ah, god. You still got it. Oh... I don't know. I am never doing that again. Oh, god. On your mark... set. You know, I honestly didn't mean to trip you. It really was an accident. Did you hit me by accident too? No. That was on purpose. Sorry. Um... all you have to worry about now is running your best tomorrow. Until we meet again. See ya. Mr. Stiles, we've heard arguments from your psychologist and track coach. But now I need to personally hear from you. Why did you physically confront mr. Keflezi in such an unsportsmanlike manner? Well, sir, I thought he was insulting my friend who couldn't be there to defend himself. Well, mr. Stiles, what would you do if this runner insulted you or your friend again? Well... i'd go out on the track and... run him into the ground. Mr. chairman, may I say a few words on my son's behalf? Please. It, uh... it took a lot of guts for cam to come here today. He had to fight a lot more than mr. Keflezi. He had to fight his father and his former football coach, both of whom would be me. I'm not here to tell you what to do, but I just wanted to stand up here in front of all of you and tell my son that I am very sorry. I made this a lot harder on you than it had to be, cam. I should have been a father first. I'm sorry. Thank you, coach stiles. A few moments ago, we received a fax from mr. Keflezi. Now, cameron, I'm sure you understand that we have to give his feelings about this matter strong consideration. I understand, sir. Mr. keflezi writes... "I've just learned that the golden west invitational "will now reconsider the return of cameron stiles "to the upcoming competition slate. "And based on my recent experience with him, "I strongly feel that mr. Stiles "does not have the maturity "to be included in any future events. "However, "since I am personally planning to run a sub-4-minute mile "at the invitational, "and mr. Stiles had made it very clear "that he shares that same goal, "I believe it would be unfair to me if he were not included. Sincerely, seneca keflezi." Mr. Cameron stiles, after conferring with the other members of the board in closed session, we have come to a decision. While we are aware of the emotional stress you've endured as a result of your loss, it remains the ultimate goal of this board to nurture our talented athletes. And as such, we cannot condone your actions. Therefore, as difficult of a decision this was to reach, it is the judgment of this board to deny your appeal. Mr. stiles. I'm sorry about what happened. I tried to help, but... bureaucrats can be so unbending. Tell me about it. Appreciate your letter, though. You didn't have to do that. I want to race against you, mr. Stiles. Do you still want to run against me? Of course I do. I can arrange for us to run. Sanctioned. Official time. I can also provide other runners and officials. Why would you do that? Let's just say I need a tune-up before I break the record at the invitational. You got yourself a race. Good. Hey, cam. Hey, allie. What are you doing here? I've had something I've been meaning to show you for a long time. I thought it might be in bad form, but I made this... that night at the party. Besides being skinny as a toothpick, what's the secret to running fast? What's this for? I'm making a video for my class where we interview people about what they love. Ten seconds... well... you have to make up your mind before the race even starts that you're gonna win, no matter what it takes, no matter how much it hurts or how much you wanna quit. That is like so completely... not very interesting. Well, you asked. Say good-bye to everyone. Good-bye, everyone. Are you mad I didn't show you before? No. No. I'm glad you saved it till now. Thanks. Hey, what's up, man? Good luck! Thanks, mom. How ya feeling? I'm ready to do it. Go out and get it done. I've prayed for guidance. And what I've realized is that it's not fair for me to keep brandon away from you or this race. He's a great kid. He wasn't trying to hurt you by hanging out with me. He was just... helping me. You have to understand how this has challenged my faith. These are john's. He said that they were lucky. He wouldn't want them sitting in a closet. Thanks. You've come this far for my son. I can see that now. So finish the job. We both need forgiveness. Spent a lot of time with you. Don't let me down. Runners to the starting area. Runners to the starting area. This is it, john. All right, cam, come on, stay focused! On your mark... set... stay calm. Watch the elbows. 59! Too fast. Too fast for the first lap. I can't let the pace slow here. Stay with him. Stare at his back. 62! 201! Pick it up, cam! Halfway. No decisions here. Whatever's comin'... i gotta do it. Go! Okay... it's gonna get worse. Way worse. I can take it. Bring it on. Go! This is where I went too fast last time. Just keep him in range. 61! 302! Go! I need a 57 on this lap. Can't do a 57. Have to do a 57. I can't wait. If I wait, I won't have it. I have to wait. Wait until 100 yards. Aw, screw it. I'm not waitin'! Is this a mistake? Did I kick too soon? No, no, that's not in the plan! He's always had a mind of his own. Well, gee, I wonder where he got that from. Cam, don't! Come on, cam! Hold up! John... help me. I gotta take him from the outside. Stay outside! Come on, cam! Take him on the outside! Come on, cam! Come on! No! Second! I lost? Oh, no... no! In first place, seneca keflezi with a time of 3.58.79. Yes! Yes! In second place, cameron stiles with a time of 3.59.12. What? What? He did it! Sub-4 mile! My son is a runner! Whoo! Look at this! Look at that time. Look at that! You did it! You did it! You did it! Dad. Good job! Thanks, dad. Great job. Mr. stiles. Great race. Congrats, man. It's all you. No, no, we share. I could not have done this without you. We run one more. Together. You're on. Go get 'em. Go get 'em. I'll be back. Whoo-hoo! Hey, stiles. Are you coming or not? Yeah, I'm comin'. Are you okay? I think so. You can stay a little longer if you want. No, we can go. They say that every morning in africa, an antelope wakes up. It knows it must outrun the fastest lion or it will be killed. Every morning in africa, a lion wakes up. It knows it must run faster than the fastest antelope or it will starve. It doesn't matter whether you're a lion or an antelope, because when the sun comes up, you'd better be runnin'.
