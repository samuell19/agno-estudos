Hello, strangers. I don't know where to start this story. There are too many things I want to share, but sometimes what I want doesn't feel matter. Our farewell is too bitter to be remembered, but our togetherness is too precious to be forgotten. I, then, asked to the memory of you. I'm glad that we met. Memories are just something I carry. My life was colorful with her. But now everything is black and white. Are you sure you still want to go there? Of course. We're already here, anyway. Okay. But we only have enough gasoline to go home. Are you sure you don't wanna go home? I still remember our way home. Seriously? We're here already. Let's just go. I think we're almost there. Come on. How do you know we're almost there? I don't know. I just feel it. Let me summarize what this story is about. This is the story of my encounter with a woman. The sweetest woman I've ever met. The woman I thought was gonna be my fate. You and I. We both have a problem with direction. I'm leaving. Are you? To Taiwan. When? Next week. I knew it. You only came to say goodbye. How long will stay in Taiwan? Three months. Are you gonna miss me? Maybe. Thanks. Thank you for being patient, for being with me and staying by my side. I think I love you. Too bad, I don't. Yes, this is a story of a woman. The woman I loved, but then we separated. Maybe what I try to share this time is a guideline for farewell. A GUIDELINE FOR FAREWELL I don't know why I wrote this book. My psychologist recommended it to me. He said writing is a perfect therapy for me. There are a thousand reasons to write. One of them is to remember. Or to forget. - Excuse me, Sir. - Come in. Please, come in. Please, sit down. Thank you so much for coming. - Thank you, Sir. - Yes. Please. Here... I brought you the latest draft. Yes. I've read the previous draft. When I read it, I got a feeling... that it is a personal story. So, is this your own story? Eminus Dolere. What does it mean? It means grieving from afar. "Grieving from afar." CHAPTER 1 THE ENCOUNTER Do you always bring cat food wherever you go? Yeah, sometimes. Do you like cats, too? I do. I like dogs, too. Do you believe that the movie was romantic? I do. I think... a lot of memorable moments... are easier to happen. With digital movie, we can capture a lot of moments. We'll have more time, more memories. An 8 mm can only give you 15 minutes, right? It's so limited. Don't you think? So, the momets recorded are like, "Let's record something." So, it's not raw, not spontaneous, not natural. - You've got a point there. - Right? Sorry, have we met before? I don't think so. Sorry for acting so friendly. It's okay. Cats at this age are the cutest. Yeah, they're super cute. What should we name it? Hey. You said you wanted to check out the camera. - You have it? - Yeah. I brought it. Okay. Wait a minute. Why don't you give it a name. What? Potato. Sweet Potato. See you. I think we've met before. Do you still have cat food with you? No. Not today. How's Sweet Potato doing? Sweet Potato. - You still remember. - Of course, I do. What book are you looking for? Nothing specific. I'm just looking around. But here is a good poetry book. Poetry? I'm looking around, too. But I'm looking for a book about management. Management? So serious. I have to. It's my thesis. Do you study here? In Jakarta. What about you? I study Finance here. Finance? So serious. But my dream is to be a writer. What do you want to write? Fiction, non-fiction? More to fiction, but sometimes poems, too. - Something like that. - Poems? I don't like poems. Language is complicated. It's like you give someone something, but you throw it first to a pile of hay before you give it to them. What are you laughing at? Don't you realize? You said you didn't like poems, but you said it in a poetic way. - I did? - You did. That part about throwing it first to a pile of hay? That's very poetic. No, it's not. It's an argument. It's called an argument. Okay. Let's agree that your argument is poetic. Yes, agreed. Just to end it quickly. So, do you write everyday? Yup. But sometimes I don't. What about after this? I plan to write. Where? At a cafe over there. There's a cafe over there? - Yup. - Really? Can I bother you while you're writing? Okay, I won't. I'll just be quiet. I swear. I'm just looking for something to do. - Okay. - Can I? - Sure. - Really? Okay, let's go. Where is it? I don't know why I pictured you drawing a cat. Yeah, anything random. Draw whatever comes to your mind. Talking about writing, have you watched this movie? An Indonesian movie. An old one. It's called, "Apa yang Kau Tjari, Palupi?" If I'm not mistaken, it's a... '60-ish movie? - Yeah, in the '60s. - Am I right? Yeah. So, Palupi married a writer. The writer was very idealist. He was a man of principle. It's fine for him to live a humble life. Palupi, as a housewife, may get bored. So, she told her husband that she wanted to be an actor, she wanted to be a movie star. Her husband then introduced her to a movie director. Eventually, Palupi fell for the director. The director even left his girlfriend for her. But after the director did that, Palupi dated a businessman, someone else. I think I can relate to Palupi's quarter-life crisis. Her confusion, I really get that. Don't you think so? And what I like about this movie... is that it made me wonder. Why can't a woman look for her own happiness? People would seem to judge her. "This woman doesn't seem to know what she wants." "It seems like she doesn't have a goal, she's confused." On the other hand, if Palupi were a man, people would cheer on him. "He may be exploring his life, looking for his true self." Right? It annoys me. Deep inside, I think a movie is very personal to its filmmaker. That' right. Right? Do you think it's important that a work should be personal? It is. Thank you. You're welcome. Come back tomorrow. Promise? Be our loyal customer. - Take care. - Okay. Thank you. - Take care. - Goodbye. Okay. This is it. This is it. How about meeting here everytime I come to Yogya? Here? - Okay. - Okay. Okay. I gotta go. Bye. See you. Bye. I'll let you know by e-mail, okay? Thank you, Sir. You're welcome. I'll accept this. I'll go over this again. Come in. Excuse me, Sir. There is a document that you need to sign. Oh, yes. Okay. Why don't you wait here? I need to take care of something. I'M IN YOGYA, WANT TO MEET AT OUR REGULAR PLACE? THERE'S SOMETHING I NEED TO TALK ABOUT. I love you. I love you in a careful and insensible way. Although I know love has to be sensible because it needs an explanation, love is insensible because it can only be felt. Love never gives you a certainty, so that it is certainly uncertain. Bara. We'll e-mail you for the next step. Thank you. Excuse me. The woman I told you about just sent me a text. She wanted to see me. After a year not seeing each other. I've received her invitation. She's getting married soon. Like I told you before, we both have a problem with direction. CHAPTER 2 TOGETHER Thank you for picking me up. Thank you. I'm hungry. Let's get some breakfast. - What do you have in mind? - I don't know. What's good in Yogya? How long are you going to stay in Yogya? About two weeks. Two weeks? That's pretty long. What? You don't want me here for too long? That's not it. But you've got your work in Jakarta. I resigned. Are you serious? But you've only worked there for a year. It's okay. I'll get another job. And from Yogya, I plan to continue my trip to... either Bali or Lombok. Come with me. Bali or Lombok. - I can't. - You can't. Why? I've got a job here. You're no fun. Just skip work for once. Ask a permission to your boss. Okay? You know what they say? An old couple will share the same characteristics. Couple? Are we even a couple? Are we not? We never talked about when and how we officially started dating. Is it a must? You've got a point there. Can I borrow your top? It's over there. Just go out, and turn left. - That's my wardrobe. - Okay. - Just pick one that you like. - Okay. Isn't it too big? That's the concept, your clothes. So, no. Do you have another song? Let's go to the beach. Out of the blue? It's not. I love beaches. Who doesn't love beaches, anyway? I don't. Why? It's crowded there. - Mountains? - It's crowded there, too. Okay. How about going to a hill that people seldom visit? Deal. But you have to promise me you're not gonna change your mind at the last minute. -And it's not gonna be crowded. -Okay. Deal. Deal. I want to love you in an intractable and illogical way. You are everything that's called heaven on Earth. I want to be loved like the way you let go of the things you can't have. Like when we bid farewell. Like when we decided to go separate ways. I want to be loved the way you love yourself right now. With the happiness that I'll never have. An old friend just came in, didn't say anything, not even hi. Didn't even make an order. How are you doing? Nothing new. Did someone come? This boy. What are you thinking? I opened this place five hours ago. Of course, I've had some customers. I meant, my friend. The one with short hair? If she had come by, I would've known. Right? The short-haired girl? But it's been a while since she was here. Hold on. About a month ago she came here, sat over there, in front of the barista, but... she just stared at the door as if she was looking for someone. I thought she was waiting for you for a date. Are you going to meet her now? Yes. We made a date to meet here. She's coming in a moment. Okay, let's just wait. One coffee, please. The regular one. What are you talking about? I ordered the coffee for you. I meant, for my friend. But she's not here, yet. The coffee will get cold when she gets here. She'll be here in a moment. Are you sure? Yes. I don't want my customer to be disappointed. Jul. - Yes? - Where's the coffee? It's ready. Bring it here. - Alright. - I'll make the latte. Thanks. Take it easy. Your book is going to be published. Keep it up. Okay? Here you go. - Thank you. - Anytime. Do you believe in marriage? For now... I do. What about you? I don't know why, but I don't. I'm just scared. Imagine this. You wake up everyday, looking at the same face. For me... It feels like a jail. I feel like being married is like being monopolized. You are owned by one person. And I think marriage is like a business. Even on a wedding ceremony, it's like... the groom's family buys the bride from her family. It really sounds like a business to me. It's like an employment contract in which you are given a choice, but you can't argue with it. You know something? My parents once set me up with a guy. Really? How was it? It was really serious. It wasn't for fun. It wasn't like they introduced us to each other, and then our cousins would tease us. So, our families met. Everything was so serious. I didn't know we still do such a thing. Not to mention you live in Jakarta. You can say that again. When I first found out, I refused. I ran away from home and everyone was looking for me. They kept calling me, "Where are you, Demi?" All the drama. I thought my family was the modern type. But... That was it. I don't understand their way of thinking. Maybe I don't believe in marriage because of my parents. Are they not together anymore? On the other hand, it's because they're still together... although I know they don't love each other anymore. THERE'S A CAFE DOWNSTAIRS. SORRY, I'M NOT COMING TO OUR REGULAR PLACE. WANT TO MEET AT ANOTHER PLACE? Maybe my yearning is weary. It's dead and refuses to revive. We are a couple of book pages that are late to open. We complete each other, but impossible to be together. The chances to be together keep us hanging. That at one point we will walk hand in hand. But we know. Those dreams, those wishes will never be a reality. Hi. Hi. How are you? CHAPTER 3 FAREWELL Have you been waiting long? No, I just got here. How was the trip? It feels like ages. The train kept stopping. It would be nice to be a fish. They are forgetful. They never get sick. A forgetful person is the best. Why are you talking about people? I was talking about fish. Tell me a story. I love listening to your stories. Funny stories. Fairytales. Dirty stories. Just stop working already. Do you realize this, you can show up here out of the blue and go AWOL the next day? Like this, right now. You're going to, where was it again, Taiwan. So what if I'm going to, I don't know, Jakarta, Taiwan, or anywhere? I told you, I'm going to Taiwan to learn the language. Yes, but it was so fast for you to make the decision. You just asked for a trip yesterday, and now you already booked the ticket to Taiwan. Why does it matter now? You were fine with it yesterday. I can't believe someone can do that. What have you been working on? What's taking you so long? Did you open my Facebook? You're still logged-in. I read all your messages. And what did you find? Did you find anything you're looking for? Nothing. Just a little chat about what I do. What about it? It stated there that I'm just a writer. I never said that to anyone. Maybe I didn't read it correctly. That's it. I'd better leave now. Coming here is waste of time! Fine. No one asked you to come, anyway. And no one asked you to stay. Fine. I'm leaving. Why so serious? This time... how long are you going to stay in Yogya? I don't know, yet. And... after staying in Taiwan, for three months, where are you going? Are you going to Taipei after this? Tokyo? Or maybe somewhere closer, like Bali or Sumba? I don't know, yet. Maybe I'll stay in Yogya. This is crazy. What are you doing here? You? Give me a minute. - How are you? - How are you? - What are you doing here? - I do come here a lot. - Don't you know it's my gallery? - Really? Seriously? I got my name at the front. - You're a curator? - Yes, it's my work. How long has it been? This exhibition has been about six months. A few months ago there was a statue instalation. - Was that from you, too? - Yes. It's part of this exhibition. It's been months, so we want to make... - Is this the position? - Yes. - Want to check it out? - Sure. Come on. Just for a while. Let's be nice to him. It won't take long. - Where are you going? - Home. Why? The party's just getting exciting. Come on. Just enjoy your time with your friend. He is an old friend. I haven't seen him for ages. Let's hang out, the three of us. What is it that you want? I want to take you back to the gallery. Come on, let's enjoy our time, the three of us. No. I mean, all of this. One minute you're here and the next day you're in Jakarta without a word. I don't get you. What is it that you want from me? I just wanna be with you. Yes, I know. But what are we? Why do we have to put labels on everything? Friend, boyfriend, partner. Why can't we just do this? We're comfortable with each other. And that's it. You don't dream for a future with your friend. Future? You never talked about that. Yeah, with what you do. You put that dream in my head, don't you realize that? It's all in your head. I've never expect any of them. There are others like me, aren't there? What do you mean? Well, how many other guys are there in my position now? One in Jakarta. One in Surabaya. One in Taiwan, maybe one in Singapore. One in America or Tokyo. Is that so? How could you say that! Tell me. - Tell me now. - No! What for? You just jumped into your own conclusion. Okay. So, it's true. I'm just an escape for you. "I feel sad. What should I do?" Just go to the stupid guy in Yogya who's always there for you. Right? Now, let me ask you. What do you expect? - To have a family with me? - Yes. - To have kids with me? - Yes. - You know I can never stay. - But why? Why can't you stay? If it were that easy to stay, I would've stayed from the beginning. What do you want from me? I just wanna be with you. Maybe it's wrong for us to expect something from each other. Maybe we have to stop, but I'm happy with what we are now. Don't think too far ahead. I don't know what kind of relationship this is. I'm sorry, but I don't know, either. It may sound like bullshit. But for me, it's love. Love? You love me? Too bad, I don't. I can't believe you really left me there! I waited there in the rain and there was no taxi. - I tried calling you. - My phone is dead! I thought you'd come back. I walked here! Where are you going? Home. Stay here for a while. It's too late to get a ticket, anyway. I'll just get a ticket at the airport. Do you think I didn't make sacrifices? It was so easy for you to say I chatted with those guys. Do you think I didn't leave anything in Jakarta? Just for you, I quit my job. Just for you, I stayed here. Just so you know, my family makes so much fuss that they'd ask me questions everytime I go to Yogya. And you said I made my moves with those guys? Do you think I mess around? You and your negative thoughts! Just stay here for a while. Don't go. I guess we have different thoughts. I'm sorry... if my coming and going like this gives you troubles. As you said yesterday, no one told me to stay here. No worries. I won't come back. If you have waited a little bit more, our relationship would've been perfect. Just the way you want it. I think this is the end of us. Slowly you go. Disappear. Leave with a deep wound. This fight doesn't make sense. We love each other. Why do we leave? We just don't want to fight. You're tired of giving chances. I don't feel like proving myself. Nothing hurt more than a separation done consciously. Maybe this is what destiny is. You fall in love, you say goodbye, and then yearning devours you until you're crazy. I've read your invitation. It's coming soon. On the 8th. It's a good date. What are you doing here? What are you looking for? I don't know. Ever since we were separated, I felt like there's an unfinished business. I can't stop thinking about it. We didn't communicate for a year. We didn't ask how each other was doing. When I was in confusion, he proposed. And it was so easy for you to say yes. It made sense at that time. Maybe if I get married, I'll find myself, maybe I'll find my goal and dream. If I let go of everything now... and we're back to square one, is that possible? A year is a long time to change someone. I was devastated. And for a year I tried crawling out of this dark cave, where I shared my dreams with you. And after I went through all that... you want me to go back to square one? It's you who's getting married, not me. Okay. There's no use of me being here. It won't change anything. You are a year late. Forget it. You won't make it. - Hang on. - Forget it. - Let's go. - Hang on. Let's just go. EPILOGUE Demi. What's wrong? Don't cry. It's okay. It's okay. Don't cry. What's the meaning of this? No. I have to go. Where are you going? I've said yes to everybody. I don't want to disappoint everyone. But this time I really can't. Okay? Open the door. Wait a minute. Haven't you done enough trouble? I just don't get it! Dad. Dad. Don't put us to shame in front of these people. Mom. All my life... I've been nothing but obedient to you dan Dad. Just this time, Mom. Okay? Please, cancel everything. You know... how much money we've spent for today, don't you? Mom. If I get married tonight... I'll be locked up in a life I don't love. You know exactly how it feels. Farewell teaches us about losing. We once loved each other, had each other, tried to be there for each other. Then, we hurt each other. We created a bad situation to hate each other. I want to stop hoping. Stop believing in the word 'possible'. It's time to say goodbye.
