THE EVENTS OF THIS FILM ARE ENTIRELY FICTIONAL WE HOPE IT NEVER HAPPENS ALEXANDRIA TAXI - 30612 ALEXANDRIA TAXI - 31622 Good idea changing the plates number, man. I don't want to implicate the taxi owner. That's so cute. Let's just pray it goes well. Pray on our way to steal? What are you thinking? - Listen. - Yes? Before we move, a deal is a deal. My share is ten grand at least. Again, Ali? Yes, again. I want to secure my share in case the safe was empty. - I swear I got it! - I don't care if you get it. I just want you to do it. You'll use your share to travel, huh? Why else would I do this with the likes of you? - Seriously, Nabil? Hash? - It's marijuana. Good, I don't want to get high. The likes of me you're talking about will pay you well if you don't travel. I don't want to be a thief. Are you going to Italy to be an ambassador? No, a mason. Take this. Wear this so you can't be recognized. - You'll keep wearing that wig? - What? That's my hair. Good, you won't be recognized. Seriously, man. How come you've been given those miracle hands and you'll get them dirty with painting walls? They've been dirty since I've known you. - Do you have more of this? - Only hash. No, I don't want to get high. What? Isn't he going for dawn prayer? Maybe the prayer is already done. When should it be? Do you think I'm that religious? Right. Turn on the radio then. It's the prayer call. He must be out by now. Let's go. Ladies and gentlemen, that was the dawn prayer call in Cairo time. It was called for by Sheikh... - I'm worried, Bolbol. - You can't be worried when I'm here. The dawn prayer call is in a few minutes at Alexandria local time. ANFOUSHI EXCHANGE Shush! Quiet! I didn't do anything. Where is it? Over there. That's the damned girl. Why is it damned, man? That's my ticket to Italy. Come to me, baby. Come to me, darling. "Damned"? Come on! It should be kissed. And hugged. And spoiled. Do you need a room with it? - Freeze! - Is that her husband? - Ali! - Nabil! Nabil! Stay with me, Bolbol. I'm here, Bolbol. Please stay with me. - The police are here. - Freeze! THREE MONTHS LATER We hereby sentence Nabil Sobhy el-Saeyd to ten years in prison. And sentence Ali Zanaty Rabeea al-Daqaq to life in prison. I was defending myself! I swear, it was self-defense! It was self-defense, Mom! Tell them, Nabil! Tell them! PRISON LAUNDRY It's your lucky day. The boss sent more clothes to wash. Have fun. As you wish, man. Tell him they're dirty. Easy, man. Can't you see the guy's face? I'm going to wash them. You dry them. Wash them! I'll wash them, I swear! Nabil! Nabil! Nabil! They hit hard, didn't they? You're getting started. You still have 25 years to go. I think you can make it. Why are they doing this? You're a new guest. They have to welcome you. Will they keep welcoming me for 25 years? I can call you a Transit Prisoner and get you out of here. - Please. I beg you! - No need. Please get me out, man. Will you do what we'll ask you? - Who are you, sir? - I'm Brigadier Shawqi. I'm yours, Mr. Shawqi. - Don't you want to know the deal? - I don't need to. I just want to get out. No matter what we'll ask? Anything. Do you love Egypt, Ali? What? Is the question that hard? I love it. And I'll do anything to take off this blue uniform. LIMAN PRISON = 56 Go ahead, sir. - Welcome. - I think I heard my mother crying. They're going to bury you. They're burring a Jon Doe. Won't they see the body? We didn't let them in, and they wouldn't open the coffin. - Let's go. - I want to see my mother one last time. May you rest in peace. Let's go. TRAINING SITE - THE VILLA - Can you shoot a gun? - No. Then how did you kill the guard? - That was in self-defense. - Don't play dumb. This is not an interrogation. Can you? I swear I can't. Excuse me. Will I kill anyone? - Take him back to prison! - No, sir! Wait, Huda! Pull it. This is an easy safe, anyone can open it. We left 1000 pounds in there. This is a medium safe. We left in there 2000 pounds. This one is harder, so 3000 are in there. This is the latest model. We left 4000 in there. So, can you open them? This runs in my veins, sir. Were your family thieves as well? Would you please stop that? I'm from a nice family. And I'm educated. None of my family members even saw the inside of a police station. - I swear to you. - Show us then. Well, will I take what's inside? - That's Egypt's money. - I wouldn't be the first to steal it! Show me. - I can't while you're here. - Why? Are you shy? No, but... Honestly, I can't open safes unless I'm naked. - Totally naked. - What? That doesn't make sense. That's how I do it, sir. Leave him, guys. Thank you, everybody. Why don't you stay? I don't get it. Why did he want to be alone? Thank you. A thief would never reveal his secrets. He's good. That's too long. I think he's not our guy. I can't believe he took all that time. We heard that he's the best one to open safes. Then what is it? So, champ? I'm sorry, sir. Find someone else. I'm so sorry. Mr. Brigadier? "From Ali al-Daqaq to Mr. Shawqi and his men. Thank you for your cooperation." Son of a... - The brigadier wants to see you. - Son of a good man. I'll be right there, sir. I'll follow you. Oh, no. Damn you! You ruined the money. Fake? Did you think we'll give you real money? - Hurry up! - Okay. Excuse me, sir. I wanted to ask you. Why can't one of your men do this mission? We can't do some missions ourselves. Why? Because if things go south, there's always a slight possibility our guy's captured. We can't afford that. So I could get captured? Of course. What if that happens? We don't know you. What about the body you buried? You killed him, buried him and fled. Egypt needs you! This is your target. Dawood Ezra. An Israeli holds an American nationality. A big gambler. Every weekend, he takes his yacht to the international waters to play. Gambling is prohibited in Israel. - Is it prohibited really? - Yes. So they can't gamble by they can kill us? Well, you don't gamble, yet you killed someone. It was in self-defense, sir. He came at me with a gun, I grabbed his hand, we kept struggling until a bullet hit him. - It's not self-defense when you intrude. - I don't get it. If the owner or the guard had killed you, they would've been innocent. This is not fair. It'd be self-defense, because it's their place. You'll get on the yacht from here. Keep walking until you find a door that leads downstairs. Enter his cabin, and he'll be sleeping soundly from all the alcohol he consumed. Kill him. Then you open the safe. And, of course, that's the easy part. - Are you happy that you're a thief? - That was the first and late time, sir. Well, not the last. But this time, I'm helping my country, so it's not wrong. Or is it? This is the first right thing you do in your life. I want everything in the safe. CDs, cameras and so on. Get me everything, even if you don't see it's worthy. Okay. Then you leave the fingerprints I gave you on the door knob. - Whose are they? - Levy's. An Israeli Army officer that had a fight with Dawood. Good. So this will be on an Israeli officer? - Yes. - That's smart. Sir, have you ever thought about changing careers? Would I die? Only God knows. Take care of my mother in case I died, sir. - Worried about her? - I'm the only one she's got. Then why did you want to leave her? To provide for her, sir. We didn't have a good life. My mother needs 1400-pound worth of medications a month. How can I get that? I've been a taxi driver, a beach seller, a lifeguard and a safe thief. It wasn't enough. What more can I do? It's getting late. You need to get enough sleep for the mission. My mother, sir. Promise me. I promise, Ali. Okay. WEDNESDAY MORNING... MISSION DAY When you're close to the yacht, act as if you fell offboard. Captain Huda will distract the guard and act as if she's panicking. At the same time, Lieutenant Osama will cover Major Rammah as he's diving to take your place. Major Rammah will take your place on the boat. You will have 40 seconds to reach the yacht and use the oxygen mask. Otherwise, the guard would suspect a foul play. Let's go. You've got it, champ. Egypt is depending on you. The guard is coming. Take care. Go. Now. In Arabic, please! This is your new passport. Abdulrahman Thabet Hilal. This is a flight ticket to Kuwait. - I want to go to Italy. - Why? I've wanted to visit it. Visit Kuwait this time. - At least we're talking the same language. - Why not? - How long would I be there? - At least a year. It'd be better if you stayed there. I won't want you to be recognized here. And our man there will help you. What if somebody recognized me here? Officially, you're dead. Some people can look alike. But that doesn't mean you can contact anyone. You'll have to forget about Alexandria. You did your part, and we did ours. This is a gift from us to start a legal business. Oh, my. Clean money does smell better. But excuse me, sir. This isn't a gift from you, that money was in the safe. Where's your gift? Go and get ready for your flight. So I won't be seeing you again? Even if you see me by change, you don't know me. These moments... Can I give you a farewell hug? Come on, sir. I'm not mugging you! This is a farewell hug. CAIRO - SIX YEARS LATER Good morning. That stock went down today. Then sell it, Hamdy, and buy the other one. - Okay, sir. - Alright. - Call me. I'll be at the office. - Sure. Okay. Bye. - Good morning, Boss. - Come in, Shahin. The bank deposit receipt. Sign here that you received it, please. You're being too cautious. You know my system, Boss. That way, I can have copies in case anything goes missing. Okay, Mr. System. I'm afraid you'd make me sign to get my clothes. Well, if you put them in the warehouse, I'd make you sign, yes. Okay, you know what to do. - You never forget, Boss? - I wouldn't be rich if it wasn't for that. May God brings you good fortune. That's enough, man. - Don't be late. They're waiting. - Okay. There's a customer here for the Astra. I'll handle her and be on my way. - Condition? - Mint condition. Didn't you say that it was bad? What do you mean, Boss? Oh, you mean the car. - I meant the customer. - I meant the customer too. If she's pretty, send her up. If she's anything like you, then deal with her. I'll send her. You're a good employee. She'll come here. Ms. Zizi, what took you so long? I should be traveling now. - How are you, Shahin? - I was a bit tired. But after seeing you, I became more tired. Get well soon. So, 85 just like we agreed? - That depends on you. - What do you mean? I can only give you 90. To get it for 85, you have to talk to the boss. Ms. Zizi, Boss. I told you about her. Of course, she must come. - Excuse me? - Hello, Ms. Zizi. - Hello, sir. - What a lovely visit. Have a seat. What do you want to drink? - I'm fine. Thank you. - No, you have to drink something. Coffee is fine. How do you like your coffee? - With sugar. - How did you know? Ma'am, your coffee has to match you. You know what to do. I think she'll get it for 50, not 85. Go, it's my business, let me handle it. You need a new car. Why do you want a used car? - Congratulations. - I can't believe it. It's too expensive. Don't worry. Pay 90 now and then pay installments. - How much would I pay monthly? - I don't care. The contract, man! I think it's meant to be. The car matches your shirt. "Shirt"? This is a coat! Don't gloat! What did you say your name was? - Zizi. - What a name! You're so cute. Get me that contract! See you next month, ma'am. Won't you tell me who sends these? Good people are everywhere, but that's their system. They don't want to be known. I wish to see him and thank him myself. This is more than I need. What should I do with all this? You can take an Ummrah trip. I know you will one day. You're a good person, that's why you found good people to help you. May I use the restroom? I have diabetes, I need to use it often. - Of course, son. - I need to go right now. - Come on, dear. - Thank you. - Where's the restroom, ma'am? - This way. Thank you, dear. Wow! Are those your sons? Where are they? I only had Ali, but he passed away. I'm so sorry to hear that, ma'am. ALI AND ABDULRAHMAN VILLA Samir! Hello! Happy birthday. - Yay! - Yay? Come here, dude. Hey! Won't you give me a hug? Mommy! Look what Daddy got me. Wow! It's amazing, sweetie. Happy birthday! Isn't this the game you wanted? If you wreck it, I'll punish you. I won't, because Dad got it for me. I would've if it'd been from you. Manners! How did you make that woman buy that car? - Ms. Zero? Easy. - What? I made her think that I was head-over-heels for her. That I was doing her a favor. Paying 150,000 pounds isn't technically a favor, Boss. She was supposed to pay 90. She even wanted to make it 85. Looks like I'm a fool. She thinks I won't make her pay the installments. Would you do that, Boss? I'd get her arrested if she missed a payment. What, beautiful? Coming. Okay, coming. Let's go. They're waiting. - I wish you a happy life. - Thanks. Oh, Boss, how did you know how she liked her coffee? I doubt that she even drinks coffee. If I'd said, "She likes it black," she would've said, "How did you know?" Women, man! Wow, turns out you're not easy. Hey, you! Wait. You like your coffee medium, right? That one wouldn't take the deal! Happy birthday to him, Boss! Happy birthday to him, ma'am. Happy birthday. Happy birthday. What's wrong, baby? Nothing, darling. I love this kind part of you. Is there an evil part of me? You? Sometimes, your eyes terrify me. I'm sorry, baby. - I'm so sorry. - Don't make me worry. What now, Neven? Mom says that if my husband's sweet for no reason, then he's cheating. My mother-in-law is so... Come play with me! Let's go, sweetie. Tell me, what do you think about Grandma Farida? Even the little boy. - Not in front of the kid, Abdulrahman. - I didn't do anything. - He's smart. - Let's go to bed. Say, "Bonne nuit, Dad." Bonne nuit! I don't like that system, Boss. What's wrong? That's too many cigarettes. - I didn't get enough sleep. - Why? I've been having nightmares. You don't get any time off, Boss. Sign here, please. You need to get some rest. Take a vacation. Excuse me, Boss. I didn't deduct my advance payment this month. I'm a little tight on money now. Get some rest, Boss. You've never had a vacation since I started working here. At least for a week. It'd be a change to your system. You're right. I bet you were working none-stop in Kuwait too. Kuwait? Yes, before coming back to Egypt. How did you know I was working none-stop? No one leaves their country for anything but money. - Tell me, Shahin. - What, sir? Don't you sometimes imagine seeing someone you haven't seen in years? That what happened at the birthday, huh? - How did you know? - I noticed. - You're so eye-observant. - You're my mentor. - By the way, Boss, I wanted... - Tell them to get my new car ready. You're being too violent today. That's not good. I'm trying to catch up, Captain. I think this is enough. Go to the sauna. I dyed my hair. - Mr. Brigadier? - I wouldn't be a brigadier forever. I'm a major general now, Ali. I haven't heard that name in years. Congratulations on the villa and the business. I think you've been fortunate. It's all legal, sir. I know. Well... Why did you leave so fast at the birthday? It was a family gathering. It was no place to discuss business. Business? Do you want to change your car? I'm here after five years and you think I need a car? Don't play dumb! Then what do you want? Won't you get a shower? Won't you tell me, sir? It's an easy, clean mission this time. We need you to bring us a classified file. Don't you like the food? Don't you like the food? No, it's great. Thank you. I just have an important meeting. I'm full. Daddy, won't you play with me? - No, sweetie. Later. - Aleyiah! Aleyiah! Take these plates. Do you want coffee? No, honey, I... I'm in a hurry, I have to go to work. Oh, Ali! Bye! You know what, Shahin? I don't think I made any friend since I came back from Kuwait. I'm going to be frank with you, Boss. I don't like your system. You don't give yourself the chance to make friends. You're either here with us or at home with your family. People need other people to talk to. May I have that honor, Boss? Talk. I mean, if you want to. - If somebody... - Yes? ...asked you for a favor that you couldn't do, what would you do? I wouldn't do it. I'd find a nice excuse. Even if that somebody was an important figure? Here? Well, that would change everything. What would you do? Money. That would solve the whole issue. That's the best favor now, Boss. 250,000 EGP Good morning. - Is Ali at school? - Yes. What's wrong? You sure seem in a better mood. Let it go, honey. It was a work problem and I sorted it out. - What problem? - Some work problem. Is that the secret you're keeping form me? From you? So, tell me. A merchant took cars worth more than two million and he refuses to pay. - What will you do? - what will I do? What would I do? I'll take over his dealership. And pay the rest later. See how everything sorts itself out? You didn't have to yell at me. I'm sorry, honey. You're the only one who puts up with me. - I'll go change. - Abdulrahman? I feel sorry for that guy. - Is Ali at school? - Yes. - Is Aleyiah in the yard? - Yes. Come with me. We'll discuss this in the bedroom. Good morning, Boss. Did I startle you? No, I'm fine. I just didn't hear you coming up. - It's okay. - Sign here, please. What is this envelope? A man gave it to Gaber and told him that it was for your eyes only. Maybe someone needs help or something. Everyone knows you're a do-gooder. Is something wrong, Boss? You can go now. TO MR. ABDULRAHMAN HILAL - TOP SECRET Hassan Mwafi, a parliament member. We found out that he's a member of a terrorist organization. The files are in a safe inside his home office. Here's the address and a blueprint of the house. Take everything in the safe, including the cash. To make it look like a robbery. - Are you trying to bribe a major general? - No, sir, you got me wrong. I just think that you can hire many people with that amount. Tear it. I could charge you with bribery. Okay. Do it on Saturday at two a.m. - Okay. - They'll be in Sharm al-Sheikh. And coincidently, the guard's mother died and he away for the burial. BREAK Do you want popcorn? No, thank you. Mr. Shawqi, I'm a father now. I now have something to lose. We've paved the way for all of that. I know. - But I've already paid the price. - What price? - How much? - Twenty-two. Here. There's something that upsets me. Why didn't you tell me that you stole a diamond from Dawood? Honestly, it looks amazing on your wife's necklace. Here. Meet me at this address at 2:30 a.m. after you're done. Take it! Take all the files from the safe. Do not open them. They contain classified information. Oh, and don't forget to wear gloves. Bye. I'M SORRY I CAN'T Welcome back, Boss. - Shall I get your coffee? - I'll have it in the office. It looks like you didn't get enough sleep. Have a seat, Shahin. Where did you use to work before? Well, you know, Boss. You took me yourself from Amir's dealership. - No, before that. - I worked at Car Customs Office. But they paid so little. Then I met Mr. Amir, and he was good to me. So I started working for him with double the salary. Is there something wrong, Boss? - Has anyone said something about me? - No, nothing, man. I just didn't know anything about you. How come? I've been working here for years. When we started, this dealership has three cars! - Just don't jinx it. - Of course not. I can't jinx the man who've been helping me. Okay. Book me three tickets to France, leaving the day after tomorrow. Have a nice trip. When's the return date? I want open tickets. I wanted to ask you something. - What, Shahin? - I need an advance. - You haven't paid the last one yet! - It's a little tough right now. - How much? - I need 120,000. Choose the favorable payment system. I can sign IOUs or something. Anything, sir! I put one sugar cube. Don't bother Uncle. You didn't have to. Come down. Come here, Abdulrahman. You friend, Mr. Refaat, is very nice. How dare you didn't tell your wife about me? Come on down, Ali. See what Uncle brought me? Okay, come down. Come here. - Such a good kid. - Aleyiah! Help me. Come on. I missed you. Give me a hug, man! I'm not mugging you! He's so funny. Where have you been, Mr. Refaat? In Kuwait. I've just come back. Come on. - Feel at home! - Have a seat. By the way, I'm the reason of his success in Kuwait. If it wasn't for me, there wouldn't be Abdulrahman. Am I right? Of course you are, sir. "Sir"? See? Your husband is addressing me formally. - I won't get involved between two friends. - Right. Congratulations on the marriage and the kid. I know I've been away, but you know how life is. It's weird. Why haven't you been talking since you're close friends? You're trying to cause trouble, aren't you? No, seriously. It's your husband. He disappeared after the last time I saw him. Do you remember the last time we met? When I gave you the passport. Your husband... I'm sorry, man. He lost all of his papers. Everything was stoles. And I was the one who sorted everything out. You didn't ask me why I'm back after all these years. - Why would I? I already know. - Tell me. I wouldn't dare to deny. Neven is our witness. I bet you're here to bother somebody. Right! You're absolutely right! Who do you want to bother? Your husband. Who else? I'm hungry. I'm buying dinner. What are you saying? You're our guest. - Dinner will be served in ten minutes. - You don't have to! Abdu and I are used to street food. Not anymore. She's a good woman. What will that poor thing do when she finds out about you? Is there something in my eye? Wow, Neven. This is so good. Thank you. Here you go. You should eat. I'm not a guest. You too. We don't want her to think you're not happy to see me. You've just said that you're not a guest. You're family. Finally he says something nice! Forgive him. He's been nervous for a couple of days. - What's wrong? - Nothing. Normal work issues. If someone's upsetting you, I'll handle it. What do you mean? You're scaring me. No. I just care about Abdulrahman's best interests. - What would you do then? - It's easy to hurt someone. Would you hire thugs? I have a huge network. The Parliament, Interior Security, Eternal Affairs. I have my ways. Everyone has an arm to twist. What would twist yours? Nothing. You know, Neven? I must do whatever I set my mind to do. Tell her. The escalope is tasty. - Enjoy it. - Thank you. Eat. Eat. You're never mentioned Refaat before. There was no occasion. Did he know your late parents? I don't think they'd met. Weird. He seems like he's a close friend. My friends don't have to meet my parents. - What did he do in Kuwait? - Come on, Neven. Will we talk about him all night? I finally met someone who knew you in the past. - Act as if you didn't. - Why? I don't like him. He acted like you were best friends. Not best friends. Expats love the company of any Egyptian, but... But it doesn't matter, I'll sort it out. Why did you need it? - I wanted to buy a steal flat in Faisal. - Buy what? A steal flat. But I think it's not meant to be. - Anything else, Boss? - No, thank you. SATURDAY NOON... MISSION DAY There's a customer who insists in seeing you. - What does he want? - He wants to buy a sold car. I told him he couldn't. But he insists on buying it and talking with you. I don't need him. I was told you wanted to talk with me. He says that I can't take the car now. I have an important appointment today. Can't you postpone it? That cannot be done. Do you have to go with a new car, sir? For good luck. So you have to buy a new car for every appointment you make? - I'm such a good customer, huh? - Give him the car. - It's sold, -sir, I... - Do as I tell you! If it'll be a problem... Couldn't you choose any other car? - When it's the one, it's the one. - Right. I'll come back in the afternoon. - Think about it. - Prepare the contract. What a weird system! As you wish, Boss. It's sold, I swear. I don't know how the boss agreed that easily. Your boss seems like a smart man. Okay, here are your temporary license plates. Obviously. - Do you want us to put it on the car? - I'll handle it. - Bring the contracts. - Yes, Boss. I'll be right up. Here you go, sir. What does he do? He's a strange man. In the end, it turns out that he's buying the car for someone else. Ali al-Daqaq. It sounds familiar, but I can't remember where I've heard it. I'm scared, Hassan. What are you scared of? Amr and Nageyiah are in Sharm, and the guard isn't here. I even ordered the bodyguards to leave. We're the only ones here. Why are you so worried? And what's with all the candles? I can't see. I think Adel suspects me. What was that? Is someone downstairs? What? I hope Nageyiah isn't back! Stay here. PRIVATE GIZA - 598617 It seems like no one's here. - No guards. - It's strange. I'm so sorry, sir. I'll get you a paper towel. Where have you been? - Out. - Yes, I know that. Where were you? Your phone was here. I was getting some air. - Where are you going? I'm not done. - Enough, Neven! Finish your investigation in the morning. I'm tired. Here you, sir. Again, I'm very sorry. - That boy is fired. - It's okay. Do you need a new phone? I just want to make a call! Of course, sir. Go ahead. Hello? Check, please! The bitch you were with just called to make sure you're home safe. I wasn't with anyone. She called, and as soon as she heard my voice, she hung up. Lower your voice, Neven. The kid is asleep. Is that all you worry about? - But you don't care about how I feel. - I swear you're wrong. - Don't swear. - I swear... Call her. Open the speakerphone. - Hello. - Hello? This number called me. - Where are you, man? - It's you! - Neven thought you were a woman. - Do not play dumb! Talk to her. - Answer him. - Hello? Hello! The man was there. I was about to hit someone on my way. - He must have gotten your plate number. - Now what? Excuse me, Doctor? How is the parliament member, Mr. Hassan Mwafi, doing now? - Do you know him? - I'm his neighbor. The man who was going to hit me must be the suspect. Did you see him? You look familiar. I'm Mohamed, from his security staff. Right. By the way, I got his plates number. - Where are you going? - I'm Major General Shawqi. Damn! Amr. - Do you need something? - Yes, Dad. Get all the documents from the safe and put it in the other villa. Don't worry. The house is under surveillance. The police can't find those documents. You have to get them out. Do as he says, Amr. There's no one guarding the other villa. But no one know about it. - Do as he says! - Okay. I will. Mr. Amr, may I have a minute? - Are you sure your father was alone? - Yes. Then who called the ambulance? Who opened the gates? Who opened the door? - It must be the killer. - Such a sweet killer. Mr. Amr, I'm talking to you here as I don't want your father to hear this. - Hear what? - Does he have a mistress? - What are you saying? - A woman called the ambulance. She must have been with him. She opened the gates then left. Mr. Amr, if you have any information, please tell me. - This is an attempted murder. - Okay. I'll call you once Dad is out. Okay. Excuse me. There's no car with that plates number. - Why did you leave him? - He ordered us to. - Why? - I couldn't refuse an order. Amr just left. Got it, sir. What is this? - Ali didn't go to school today? - No. Why? What's the matter, sweetie? - Are you sick? - No. - Mom made me. - Ali! - She made me. - What's the matter? We thought we'd come with you. - Where? - You're going to work, aren't you? I am, Neven. Why would you come? To hang out. - Hang out at my work? - Why not? Come on, Ali. Let's go with Daddy. Take your jacket, Ali! Why didn't you let him go to school? - To come with us. - You could've come alone. What would your employees say? And what would they say now? That the kid wanted to go to work with his daddy. - I'm glad you're here, baby! - Merci. Merci? Yeah, why not? PRIVATE GIZA - 598617 Uncle Shahin! What a lovely surprise! - Welcome! - Take him. Why aren't you at school? He wanted to come with me. Two cups of coffee, please. - Right away. - Hi, Hany, how are you? - Hi, ma'am. - You got something here. - Would you help him wash his mouth? - Of course. Good to have you here, ma'am. Let's go, Mr. Ali! What a great car! Can I drive it? No, you're fat! I'm fat? Let's go, kid. - "Reposit" receipt. - What? - "Reposit". - Deposit. You're like a virus! You taught him to ask for my signature? - Of course. Business is business, Boss. - Give me that. - God bless him, Boss. He's smart. - Thank you. Won't you get that? Why won't I? Well, let's go finish some work, Mr. Ali. - Excuse me. - Take care. Of course. Let's go. - Hello? - We'll drive it together. Put him on. - Hi, Refaat. - Why is your phone off? Is Neven with you? All good, thank you. No, we're all fine. Neven is here at the office. We got the plates numbers covered. Really? Nothing's happened. What a relief. Finish the mission tonight. No more mistakes. - Tonight? - We'll be at Mom's for my sister's party. I can't tonight. We have a family thing. I called the hospital. They book two more suites. They're staying with him. This is your best shot. Do it tonight. Understood? Let me know how it goes. Okay, bye. Do you want coffee? I'm still drinking mine. - Just a fresh cup. - It's still fresh. Okay, good. Where's Ali? I feel like he's keeping a secret. As I told you, stay with him and don't keep your eyes off of him. What if he was meeting with a friend? You'd go with him. Never let him be alone. Do you think he's cheating, Mom? Anything could happen, Neven. - Good evening. - Good evening. Do you have a black Vectra with license number 596817? - Yes, it's our... - Wait, Neven. Go. Say that you'll move your car, so she doesn't notice. Excuse me, I think I block someone's way with my car. I'll go move it. Excuse me. Come on. - Give us a minute, Osama. - Yes, sir. Your sister-in-law's suitor is good. Say yes. Is this why you're here? The location changed. Hassan Mwafi asked his son to move the documents to another location. Here's the address and a blueprint of the place. Can't we postpone the mission until the coat is clear? You have to get the documents as soon as possible. Why do I have to do it? I've already told you. You're nothing. Use this to drug Neven so she doesn't notice that you're gone. I know she's been a headache lately. Many people were meant to be heroes in the shadow. You're one of them. I don't want to be a hero. I want to be left alone. You will be, Ali. When you call me "Ali", I feel like I'm still in prison. - I'm afraid you'll never let me be. - I will, Ali... I will, Abdulrahman. Let's go, Osama! - Are you done? - Yes. Go if you want. - Are you looking for something? - My cigarettes? What's wrong? I forgot the towel. Is that what you're here for? Who sent you? Talk! Who sent you? Abdulrahman! My son! Where are you going? We're not staying here! Abdulrahman! Abdulrahman! Aleyiah! Who was that? Answer me! That's the police, Abdulrahman. Why didn't you stop? Who were those people, Abdulrahman? You know them, don't you? A HOTEL JUST OUTSIDE OF CAIRO Before I met you, I was working with the state security service. I couldn't tell you. I left them before I knew you. - Refaat, right? - That isn't his name. - Major General Shawqi. - What is your name? I'm Abdulrahman, your husband, our son's father. Neven. Remember when I was nervous? They wanted me to do another mission. I tried to say no, but they forced me. I couldn't say no. I can't believe you. This is a nightmare. Neven, I did this to be together. I can't live without you. Enough lies. - Who is it? - Housekeeping! Later. Ali! Neven! I don't know what to say. The only feeling I'm sure about... is that I'm no longer safe with you. The safety you promised me when I first met you, whatever you name is. I think that's enough. For Ali, not for me. I'll try to provide him the safety you've never provided us. The mobile you've just called is out of service. Please try again later. THE BOSS I'll try again, Officer. His and his wife's phones are still not available. Is this a habit of his? No, this is not his system. I hope they're fine. THE BOSS CALL ME WHEN YOU'RE ALONE. ABDULRAHMAN A friend of mine sent me a joke. A guy went into the pool, but hit the balls! Right, it's not funny. That's why I deleted it. I'll order something to eat. - Gaber! - No, there's no need. Here's my card. Call me if he comes or contacts you. Of course, sir. Goodbye. Goodbye, sir. It was great having you, sir! - Gaber! - Yes, sir? I'll be in Mr. Abdulrahman's office. If anyone asks, I'm not here. - No interruptions. - Yes, sir. I'm fine. - Has anyone come to see me? - Just a police officer. - Anyone else? - Like who? - Like anyone, Shahin! - No, Boss. What are you going to do now? I have no idea. Tell me, how are your wife and Ali? They're fine. Shahin, if anyone asks about me, send me a message and I'll call you. Okay, I will. Goodbye. Be safe. PARLIAMENT MEMBER HASSAN MWAFI'S SON KILLED MEMORIAL SERVICE FOR THE LATE AMR HASSAN MWAFI - I'm sorry for your loss, Hassan. - Thank you, Adel. I'm sorry for your loss. Switch seats, Nageyiah. Are you sure you didn't see the man who stabbed me? I said I didn't. He's the one who killed Amr, Ihsan. Rest his soul. May God have mercy on us all. His son, not him. I want him to feel the pain of losing a son. I knew there was something off about that man. His parents died in Kuwait. He has no family whatsoever. You're saying this now? You welcomed him with open arms. Oh, my God. Yes, here. - Wait for me. - For how long? Ten minutes. Okay. - Welcome back, Mr. Abdulrahman. - Hi, Abdulbasit. - Are they up there? - Yes. - Hello. - Hi. May I talk with Neven? She's not here. She's at her aunt's in Ismailia. Anything else? - Goodbye, sir. - Listen, Abdulbasit. - When does the school bus arrive? - At 7:30. I want you to take care of him. Don't let him cross the street. - You don't have to... - Bye! - Let's go. - Thanks, sir. - Another address? - The last one. Okay. Where's your car, Boss? - It broke down. - That's okay. Good thing that you're safe. My home is right around the corner. I missed you, Boss. Come on. Come on in, Boss. Welcome. I'm sorry, Boss, if the place isn't fancy. But here is safer. Come on, sir. They can track you if you are at any hotel. Thanks, Shahin. You're welcome, sir. Here, sir. I cleaned this room, and made my wife and kids travel so you can be more comfortable. This is my pajamas. Cleaned and steamed. - I don't know what to say. - You don't have to, sir. You've been kind to me. Tell me if you need anything. I'll be in the next room. I sleep lightly. Oh, right! I'll go get something to eat... No, Shahin. I'll just sleep. Then let's drink some tea. Let's drink some tea and sit so you can tell me what's wrong. - Only if you want, sir. - Okay. Excuse me, I'll make the tea. Shahin! Shahin! Good morning. Do you need another night? - What? Where's Shahin? - Who's Shahin? - The owner. - I'm the owner. - And Shahin? - Damn Shahin! I'm the owner. A guy rented this flat yesterday. Where's he? - This is rented? - Are you crazy? Yes, it's rented! - A man rented it yesterday. - What was his name? I didn't care! It was only for one night. What are you looking for? Talk to me, man! Are you staying for another night? Is he insane? FIRST PARTY (SELLER) HASSAN MWAFI SECOND PARTY (BUYER) ADEL ORABI - A hundred and fifty? - I told you to count them. No need, sir. You're legit. It was nice to see you, Mr. Hassan. If it wasn't for my circumstances... Goodbye. Where's he now? Only God knows, sir. I did exactly what you asked me to do. I drugged him, took the files and left. - Where are his wife and son? - I don't know. But I believe they are at her mother's house. Excuse me. Do you know her address? Bye! Hey, you! The boy! So he just vanished? - What kind of car it was? - A big car. - Is it Mr. Abdulrahman's? - No, I know his car. What's the matter? Hello. Hi, Neven. Is Ali with you? He isn't. What do you mean? CAIRO SECURITY DIRECTORATE What's his last name? I don't know. - Didn't he say where he worked? - No. Are you sure his name is Major General Shawqi? He once introduced himself as Refaat. - How long have you known him? - Five years. - Since he was a brigadier. - "A brigadier." Are you sure he's a policeman? - What do you mean? - Well... Many con artists pretend to be policemen. Which happens often. I'm sure he's a policeman. Why are you so confident? Do you want to get out? Can anyone help overturn a life-in-prison sentence? I'll be back in five minutes. Is that him? Adel Orabi. The country's biggest forger. What? EXCHANGE COMPANY GUARD KILLED BY THIEF He forged a letter to the prison to get you out on a national security mission. Orabi is known to be extra careful with the documents he forges. Don't you believe me, sir? This is an official letter. You know the rules. We have to double-check. Of course, you're right. As you know, we follow rules closely. It's ringing. Even when the commissioner tried to authenticate the letter... Hello? he'd had the phone lines. One of his men answered. Hello? Yes, sir! The prisoner is yours. I'm sorry. That's what I said. We have a body ready to be placed in his cell. We'll say that he died due to acute circulatory failure. Here's the coroner's report. As of today, Ali Zanaty Rabeea al-Daqaq is dead. Understood, sir. Where have you been, Ali? We looked everywhere for you. He made me travel. After we arrested him, we asked about you. He said he didn't know. - Was he in prison? - He got out a month ago. Why did he get you out? He's gone, Mom. My Ali is gone, Mom. - Ali! - I wish it was me, Ali! - I wish it was me, Ali! - Who did this? What happened? A car without plates threw him out and left. - What happened? - They hit him on the head. You killed Ali, Abdulrahman! You killed my son! I want him back! My sweet boy! Ali! You killed him! You killed my son! You killed Ali! Bring my son back, Abdulrahman! - I won't see Ali again, Mom! - Ali's gone! I want my Ali! Ali! Ali! I wish it was me, Ali! Ali! My son! Bring by baby back! My baby, Abdulrahman! I want my baby back! REST IN PEACE - ALI ABDULRAHMAN HILAL Ali! Why was your phone off? Don't you dare think about doing anything stupid. Are the documents with you? - Yes. - Good. - Meet me at 12 o'clock... - At my dealership. Bye. Hurry up, I'm hungry. A nice surprise, isn't it? - How did you know my address? - I paid your cellphone invoice. Yummy! - Do I smell beef? - Yes, sir. So, won't you invite me in? Come in, Boss. I see your wife and kids are back. Come in, Boss. This place is way better, Shahin. I didn't want to do that, Boss. You didn't give me what I wanted. I really wanted that advance. - So you sell me out, Shahin? - They would've done it anyway. They would've gotten what they wanted. - Tea or coffee? - Sit down. - Give me the copy? - The copy? What copy? Dates? The copies you made, Shahin. Why would I make copies, Boss? Come on, man. I know you too well. You take copies of everything at the office. You have copies. Why would I make copies? Those documents don't concern me. Right. That's not your system. Here's my system. How much do you want for the copy? Who's the buyer? Adel Orabi? Wow, you've done your homework. He's the buyer in all the contracts. And I sold the originals to the seller. Who else would buy the copies? It's not rocket science, Boss. How much did Hassan Mwafi, the seller, pay you? A hundred fifty. So another 150 from the buyer? And you can buy a flat in Faisal and another in Haram. You can even make the two flats a huge one. It's a good deal. Excuse me, but what do you get from deal? I get to make it happen. We'll make it happen. When and where? Midnight at my dealership. Excuse me, Boss, but I don't take checks, only cash. Sure. You didn't get a drink. - We'll drink tonight. - Say hi to the young boss. I will. I don't have a gun! Search him. I don't have a gun! Tell them we're even, Hassan Mwafi! I want to talk to him! What do you want? No one can hear what I have to say. Shahin, the man you bribed, made copies of the documents. He'll give them to your partner, Adel Orabi, tonight. - Why would he do that? - For the same reason. Oh, so he'll sell me to Orabi. I don't care. Don't let the political immunity misguide you. It's not forever. - What do you mean? - You took loans of more than one billion. And all the assets you offered as guarantees, their deeds are forged. By Adel Orabi. So if the DA found those documents, you'd be charged of fraud and you'd lose your immunity. And you know too well what happens to people without immunity here. What do you want? Orabi and Shahin killed my son and yours. - They have to pay for it. - How? Shahin will give Orabi the documents tonight at my dealership. He could have other copies. - He wouldn't need them when he's dead. - What? You can kill any intruder on your property. It'd be self-defense. - The dealership isn't mine. - It will be. - How? - Come at 11:30 tonight. I'll have the deed ready, and we'll sign it using and old date. Each of us will get a copy. - And in return? - Nothing. I just want them gone. Why don't you do that? The place is already yours. I can't. Shahin is the manager. We know each other. You'd be a new owner. You wouldn't know him. - Will you be there? - Of course. We don't want any suspicions raised. I'll be your only witness that they tried to intrude. What will I be doing there? Just getting the rest of my things. On one condition. I'll kill them! Do we have a deal? We have a deal. Don't worry. I won't cash the check. Things will be back to normal after we're done. I'm sure you feel for me. As soon as I knew that you killed my son, I couldn't think. But I could. That's why I came to you. Has Orabi visited you after he got out of prison? Yes, and I kicked him out. Weren't you worried he might have copies? He did have copies. But his flat was robbed. - So the copies were gone. - Of course. You had to set things right. Why were you partnered? He could've stayed your forger. He got greedy. He made himself a partner in every piece of land he forged its deed. That bastard! Nothing would've been enough. Did you tell the guards to let them in? - There are no guards. - What do you mean? No one's here, even the janitor has left. What if someone else came? I'll just close the automatic gates. Shahin is here. Gaber! - Gaber! - Come on up, Shahin! - Gaber is getting coffee. - Why didn't you tell me? I know a great place near my new place. - Perfect coffee. - I didn't want to bother you. Come on. Good evening, Mr. Adel. Whoa! This is a whole new system! Come in, idiot. Come in, Shahin. Didn't you miss me? I trusted you, Mr. Abdulrahman. You betrayed me. I learned from the best. But don't worry, you'll get your money. We'll just start an auction for the documents. No, I need to understand first. What auction? Give the man the suitcase. He needs to check the documents. Everything is in there, sir. You know me. I never lose any document. I give him this, Mwafi. He is trustworthy. But only with documents. I can't guarantee anything else. Come on, hurry up. Everything is in here. Tell him, Mr. Abdulrahman. Fantastic! Come on up, sir! - Is no one here? - I thought this was better. To be more comfortable. Come on up, sir. Isn't that the Optra guy? - He is. - Where's Adel Orabi? He is. My system stopped working. What a lovely gathering. Come in. Have a seat. Good to have you here, Orabi. So, what do you think? - Amazing. - Right? A spy and heroes who live in the shadows. - The spy was a diamond seller. - He was Israeli! - He wasn't a spy. - It doesn't matter. You could've told me we'd rob him. I can't tell a thief that, You would've gotten greedy and wanted half. Right. That was way cheaper. The villa rent was very cheap. Do you know what cost me the most? The body that was buried instead of you. The guy wanted 25,000 pounds! Twenty-five thousand for a body? Insane, right? A body? Sir? - Can you understand anything? - I'm trying. Don't. If you were smart enough, we wouldn't have been here. - So I'm supposed to just pay? - You will! He's right. You have to pay. He's just come out of prison. He needs our help. We're not like Captain Huda. You have the worst luck in women. That bitch stole the diamonds and left. And Mrs. Ihsan, his wife. She was at your villa. What are you saying? What was she doing there? You tell me. A woman in a man's bedroom at two a.m. What would she be doing? Don't believe him, Orabi. You're the last person, Orabi, that I thought could be betrayed. Really? Your wife cheated on you? Really? And with whom? With the man you helped? Now you know who stole the documents and gave them to Mwafi. Good game, Mwafi. You got his wife and his documents. What are you doing? Are there more copies? This is everything! - What's happening? - Where to? - Come here! - I didn't do anything! Cease fire! If anybody moves, I'll shoot him! No one moves, please. Orabi! Mr. Sherif? I'm sorry, I'm busy, I can't shake your hands. Let Shahin go, Orabi. Shahin is my buddy. - I love you, man. - Thank you. Thank you as well. Tell your men to stand down. This isn't getting you anywhere. You can't get out. You said that before, and I got out. Orabi! Ali! Why, Ali? Self-defense. We didn't agree on this. And I didn't agree on having my son killed. Ali, I got you a new car instead of the old broken one. I know it's not the same color. I wish you were here to play together. Daddy made a mistake in the past and thought he'd paid for it. But you were the price. I wish they killed me instead, Ali. I'm sorry, Son. I miss your hug. ALI ABDULRAHMAN HILAL Subtitle translation by: Nourhan ElMor.
