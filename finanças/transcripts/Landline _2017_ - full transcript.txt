(skateboard rolling) (light music) - Dispatch, gimme a description of that subject with the theft earlier at the liquor store. - [Dispatch] Unit 515, I have a white suspect, bearded, five foot seven, torn shirt, needs to be brought in for questioning. - I got a male subject matchin' that description. He's goin' eastbound down the railroad tracks, looks like he's gonna cut through the fence line over there, I'm gonna make contact. Go ahead and send another unit this way, please. (siren blaring) Come here, come here, come here, come here. On the ground, on the ground, on the ground. Get on the ground. Why you coming through? - Ow! (exclaiming) Why are you coming through? - [Suspect] I... - Hmm? - [Suspect] I was comin' from the woods, I don't know where I am. - [Cop] Anybody come in here, take it slow now, take it slow now. - I don't know where I am, I'm just trying to get home. (groaning) Come on, is this necessary? - Relax, relax. You saw me comin' through over on the railroad tracks. You cut through on the railroad tracks you came through the woods. - I don't know where I am, I'm just trying to find a place. I'm coming from the woods, I don't know. We went to a campground, me and my friends, I got into a fight with a couple there, my friends bailed, I can't find them, I can't find my car, I can't find my phone, nothing. I just need to get home. (cell phone buzzing) - Honey, let me call you back. I'm right in the middle of something here. Okay, just tape my show, alright? What he hell do you mean the DVR's already full? Well delete some of your Castles, alright? Look, I paid for the damn DVR, you got it? No, I'm gonna call you back, I promise, but just tape my show, alright? Please. Alright, thank you, I'll call you back. (chuckling) - Tape my damn show, woman! Tape my damn show! (laughing) - It's just you and I down here, alright? I'm not a big fan of your odds. - I'm sorry. Life's just like one gigantic inside joke lately, that's all. - Well I like jokes. Explain it to me. - Alright, sit back, this one's a doozy. (soft music) - What is this kid doing? (laughing) (tires squeal) - Are you kidding me? I'll kill you. Get off the phone! (tires screeching) - Mm hmm. Nope, fire away, I'm gettin' emails left and right. Nothing's gonna stop me at this point. Yeah? Okay, so what are we doing about the cake though? Is that coming on time or do like we have a status on that? No, absolutely not. Honey, not you. You, this shirt, not happening. Huh uh. Back, back back back back back. Get that one I bought for you. - You know I almost got hit by a truck today. Life's a little too short-- - Excuse me, hold on. - for the perfect shirt. - The cake will be there an hour early? (scoffing and groaning) Okay I need this to look like someone caring planned my anniversary party. Yeah, no I'm getting like the opposite of care from you. I'm not quite sure of the word but I want like Care Bear, like, squeeze, hug, support me. What I'm getting is, I don't have any of these things ready. No, the details matter. Don't talk to me like I'm crazy. Okay, I have to go. (sighs) See this, this I wanna rip off of you later. (chuckling) Your neck is-- - Fat, don't touch it. - Yeah. I have to call the DJ back. - Oh my gosh. - Three new emails? Over one phone call? Oh ho, come on. What was his number? Hello? Pen. Hello? Yes, DJ Teddy Arskin? Gimme. Hi, this is Jack Gout speaking. Yes hi, hello, who do I make this check out to? I'm assuming it's (buzzing) not DJ Teddy Arskin. Donkey Punch Productions? Okay. Yeah, thank you. I don't get it. - Too much? - No, you look masculine. - I always look masculine. - [Jack] Hmm. - (laughing) What do you mean, hmm? - When I see you at this party tonight I'm gonna be looking at the new head of PR at the Chicago Cubs. And then we can finally put an offer in on the house. You look wonderful. - Thank you. - I love this hat. You look really sexy, like a man, like a man gorilla. (imitates snarling) Gimme this little neck. I wanna bite it like a piece of ham. (laughing) (smack resounding) Sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. But seriously Teddy. - Uh huh. - Susan, this event planner, cannot, cannot. - This is everything, Ted. The Chicago Cubs? You remember when they won the World Series? - That was 1908, do you, Jacob? - Well, listen, all I'm sayin', pal, is this is their year and we are the marketing team behind it. - See this? This right here is everything I've been working towards. This is what the promotion gets me. Okay? I remember when I met my husband, right at this table, right here. - You two met here, over cinnamon rolls? - It was the end of the night for him, it was the beginning of the morning for me, and I just, I'll never forget. I'd never seen a gay man eat a cinnamon roll like that. Like they usually eat it like I do, where you pick at it, you know, like you would. He ate it like this guy right here. (laughing) Nothin'. Anyway, he relents, gives me his phone number. We go on our first date and I'll never forget, all we talk about is our dreams and you know, all that kind of stuff you talk about on first dates. But, you know, this right here is a combination of all those dreams. It's everything. - I think it's perfect, Ted. - Are you just saying that to be a good intern, Sally? - Absolutely not, no. That's boardroom Sally's job. To kiss your ass. Mine, unfortunately, is to run errands and be generally perceived as bitchy because of my accent. - That's definitely true. - Does Barry have to romance Sanders for me too? - I just ruined my cinnamon roll. - There's the old man. - I'm 30. - Oh, I'm sorry, is middle-aged more politically correct? (tittering) - I got your urgent calls and your emergency text messages. And I've been a little busy. - Little busy? Still cost you 10 cents to receive a text? - I don't have any change. I'm not a peasant. - Read my Tumblr today? - I only read things that interest me, Barry. - How would you know if it interests you if you don't read it? - Because you don't interest us, Barry. Therefore, we don't read your propaganda. - It got 5,000 shares. - [Ted] What's that, Barry? No one cares? - 5,000 shares! Sally, Sally, where you goin'? (classical music) - Okay everybody come on in, take a seat please. Take a seat. Take a seat, take a seat, take a seat. Okay okay okay. Cell phones away, Barry, holster that please. That includes Valley of the Dolls, too, just stick it somewhere. So. Barry. I happen to think that your Tumblr blog was fire this morning. - You hear that, Ted? Fire. - Fiona, did you just say Barry's fired? Oh, I hate to see you go, buddy. - I used your bald spot to do my hair this morning. (laughing) Isn't that right, Boardroom Sally? - Not my name, that's not my name. - It's not a bald spot, Barry, this is where my huge brain goes, okay? Boardroom Sally, do not listen to this man. He's not a good person, look at him. Just look. Good person? Not a good person, no. And learn the interns' names, that's Tommy. - It's Timmy, it's Timmy. - I'm exhausted from hearing your voices. I literally am sitting here and sleeping, sleeping, sleeping. Okay, so we have some good news, we have some bad news. The good news is, we got the Cubs account! The bad news: we got the Cubs account. Okay? You are not ready for the Cubs. You are not ready for the Cubs, Ryan. Because you are a child. You are a teeny teeny tiny tiny very cute little man baby. Hmm? People, this is my legacy. Okay, this is my legacy. You kill it with this account and every business in town will be calling you. Einstein once said, "Try not to become a man of success "but rather try to become a man "of value." Isn't that nice? I'm a woman, so I have no problem becoming both, okay? Now-- (knocking) As you may have heard, I need someone to lead us up on this. I need someone to oversee everything. I need someone to make sure we are hitting everything from papers to blogs to viral and so with that, I am very pleased to announce that I am promoting Barry. - Yes! - Woo! - [Fiona] To lead us up on this. Nice job Barry. - Barry? - Okay. Just say it Ted, what is it? - Lagunitas. You and me. - Us? - Sally. - Yeah. - Killed it for ya, okay? Great account. - Nice get. - Lumomatti's. - Oh, I love pizza. - Another great account. - How much pizza did we eat for that account? - Tons, tons. - So much pizza we ate for that account. For you. - I got lactose. - For you! We didn't want to eat all that pizza, we did it for you. Under Armor. - Don't even fit in the clothes. - Doesn't even fit in the clothes. - [Jacob] Huge. - That's how much we worked on that account, for you. I'm, just... - I. - Barry? - Barry has a huge internet following. He and his little pack of teen wolves, they know viral videos better than anybody. - I don't understand what Barry's huge following has to do with the Cubs. - Nothin'. - We got, the Cubs has a huge following. - Right. - Because he's trusted, people like him. - No no, gay men like him, because you post shirtless selfies on Instagram. - And assies. - What, what, what is an assie? - Pictures of his ass. (giggling) - I knew that, I just like to hear you say it. - [Barry] I'm in my underwear, in my defense. - Oh, good for you! (laughing) Assies! Sorry! Listen. - This is unbelievable. I have been with you since the beginning. That's my promotion, Fiona, I've been with you 10 years. - Ted, life is about popularity. Our smiles, they brighten the world. - Sure do. Can you leave the room please and let me speak with Ted? Mmkay? Okay please please please move slowly 'cause it just gives me the giggles. Ted. Look at this. I built this. I built all of this 10 years ago. And I am really, really holding on, okay? There was a time when one person worked at this firm, me. But PR is a young person's game, and Barry gets that. Okay? Barry knows that our demographic is constantly on their phones and they are texting. And while they are texting they are also on Twitter, they are on Facebook, they're on Instagram. Okay? Barry and his little band of merry men, they get that. - Fiona, I've kept up with that, I have. I've kept up with it. When I started with you it was MySpace. Then it was the advent of Facebook, I kept up with that. And then don't even forget when we started we had a Geocities webpage. - I thought that would last. Listen. I love you. You're gonna work with Barry on this because I am asking you to, okay? - Chaining the Cubs account to a child who posts assies? (laughing) - Sorry, just, sorry. I just get a kick out of this whole assie thing. - It's asinine. - Ted. Hi. Someday, you're gonna run this company. Not just an account. You have to trust me on this, I'm Fiona effing Sanders. - Hey Kevin. - Mm hmm? - You know, maybe you can come over and help me out with this piece of crap that Dad bought and he's probably gonna blame me for. - Talia, it took him a month to build back home. It took him a month because I waited 29 days to do it myself. (laughing) - Hey Kevin. - Talia. - Your dad is a hoarder. (laughing) - Yeah, that's from when he started downloading porn. - Ew. - (laughing) Pogs. Tamagotchi. (laughing) Here's your pen recorder. - My pen recorder? - You used to torment people with this. - Oh, no no no no, put that in my personal box, thank you. I need that baby. Oh my God, I finally figured this thing out. - Jack Gout speaking. Hi, yes! Ah, how are you? What's new? Yeah, tell me, fire away. - Yes, yes. Pro bono work, yes. - Are you serious, Ted? What about your big promotion, huh? You're rolling in the dough now. You keep talking about the Peruvian marble tops in your dream home and your bidet and, what? - [Kevin] Shut up. - Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh, I am so, so sorry, I didn't realize. Maybe we can help you look on Craigslist. Your husband's really good-looking, I don't know. - Wait, lemme tell you somethin'. You wanna know who is a real jagoff? - Who? - Truman. - Truman? - Oh, Truman. He's a total jagoff. Think about it, he creates the CIA, then he gets us in the Korean War, then NATO, that's got Truman all over it. And let's not forget that the foreign policy we are still living with to this day. - Yeah. - Truman is the W. Bush of his time. - And to top all that he was a St. Louis Cardinals fan! - Jagoff! - There's no bigger jagoff in the world-- - Jagoff! - than a St. Louis Cardinal fan! - Jagoff! Hey, think about this. Sacagawea, her. - [Stevie] (laughs) Thought about a lot of things. Yeah. - Yeah, she's out there, Lewis and Clark, her. All that time. I wonder which one of those guys she boned. What do you think, Lewis or Clark? Who would you bone if you were her? I bet she boned both of them. - How'd we do on house, Dad? - I told you I'd unpack, didn't I? All my cherished goods are completely out of order. What is that cabinet, I mean... I've gotta fix that, okay? Did it come like that? - Uncle Stevie, can I get you a beer? - Old cheapo's gonna buy me a drink. Yes you can. You know what though, you are losin' somethin'. It ain't your wallet, it ain't your ring, it's your hair, my friend! (laughing) - Waving goodbye, it's waving goodbye. - And by the way, Sacagawea, she will bang both of them. - Don't forget you said you'd watch Liam tomorrow. - Obviously we ran out of options. - Yeah. - Yeah. (laughing) Look how light he is in those loafers. - Barry, you came. - Miss out on an event that we're never gonna remember for the rest of our lives? - I've never heard of somebody celebrating three years before. - Well, honey, when your husband's a 10 and you're a schleppy five, uh, three, okay every day you should celebrate. - Sally, I expected you to have better taste than Simon and Buttfunkle over here. Barry, couldn't wear a tie? Covers up your entire body? (clears throat) - Hi Ted. - Hi Sally, how are you? - I thought they only had these things at wakes and weddings. Your pen is dead. - Hold on, I might have one. Here you go. - What's this? - Never seen one of these? Barry is a tool. Barry is a tool. It's good, right? - Oh. - I know. I thought you'd like that. (cell phone buzzes) I'm runnin' outta hands here, I'm so popular. Oh, I gotta go, I'll be back. Barry. - Get me a drink, Barry. - The line's back there, pal. - Who are you, the bouncer? - Actually, I am, Barry. (chattering) (chatting and laughing) - Happy third anniversary. Just christened the bathroom in the hot new bar. - Because as your attorney, these are the details that I really wanna know. - So, what's the deal with that guy? - That's George. Jack's Facebook friend. - Bro, your mom left you for a dude on MySpace and you are okay with your wife having a Facebook friend? - My husband, and they're friends from high school. - Whatever, you know how I look at that. Husband, wife, I don't know who plays what. But, I watch a lot of daytime TV now, and you are at least two episodes away from bein' cryin' on a Dr. Phil episode. - Where's Fiona? - Yeah, I wasn't gonna tell you. - What is so funny? - I don't know. - 100 likes. - Oh my God, 57 retweets. - Dude, your Instagram is blowing up. (laughing) - I don't know yet. What's so funny? (mumbling) Okay. - [Jack] Ted. - Gettin' it on with the missus. - So long Barry, I'm taking a taxi. - Sally, where are you going? I hope you're not gonna have a grudge with me over this promotion. - You got the promotion? - I love you. I didn't wanna ruin our anniversary party. I was gonna tell you about the promotion. - I'm gonna kick you right in your mangina! Come here! - Damn, devil woman! - Call me Lucifer, honey! (laughing) - Hey Ted, 5,000 views, congratulations. You're now a statistic! - Alright, phones, everyone, phones! Now. Hello? Yeah, hi, hi, yeah, Ted Gout. Yeah, I could get you... How's Carrie Wood work for you on the 10 o'clock news? Carrie Wood, 20 Ks. (snapping) 20 Ks. Why are you even calling me, you don't know any of the players' names? Can I call you back? Thank you. Barry. Ann Sathers is my place of zen. - I just came by to let you know that I took down the video. I got your husband's legal threats. Anyway, I'm super busy today so I need you and your team to formulate campaign ideas, okay? - Yeah, we're gonna have a full day, you know, get some mani pedis (phone chimes) and then we're gonna get our hair done. - Hey Ted, your phone's ringing. - I hear it, guy. - Oh, what's the matter, Teddy? I thought you were done with technology. Oh, you can't live without it? (scoffs) Don't be an idiot. - Idiot. - Idiot. - You know, listen. I'm just blessed that this stuff comes easy to me. - Are you blessed, Barry? Are you really blessed? You're so blessed, Barry, everything about your life is friggin' blessed, great. - Pretty much. - Oh, by the way bro, I ain't comin' in today. - Ted, you can't do that. - I can do whatever I want, Barry, I'm Ted Gout. - Ted! - That was gay! (soft music) - Alright, tell me more about that. - No, I just go to work and come home and cook dinner for my husband and then I'm like, that's it. You're like living the spiciest life right now. - Well then we'll have to go out, I'll take you out. - Where, where are we going? - I don't know. - Oh my God, I haven't been out in forever. Tell me-- - Stop, you are boring-- - Why are you home? - A very is sitting in your office right now. - Do you have to be home? - Am I interrupting something? - I don't know. Jorge, is he interrupting something? - What? - Play along. - But I'm not-- - It's funny. - Okay, fine. This, no, you are not because we are just friends. - [Jack] Friends? What do you mean? You said we'd go back to bedroom and take off all our clothes! - Oh, you're right, I forgot. Shirt, shoes-- - [Both] Socks! - We are leaving, Ted. Please go to store and pick up prescription. Come on. George, we go have sex now. Bye bye. - Wait, did you just say you're going to your office to have sex? That's what you said? - Yes. Chill out. Bae? - Yes. - You take me to my office now. - Right away. (murmuring) - Wait wait wait wait, hey. I'm bae! I'm the bae! I'm bae. (instrumental music) - What is that? - Hungarian beef stick. - I see. I'm Norm. - Norm, I'm Ted Gout. What do you got there, Norm? - Oh, this is a sundial. - A sundial? - Yes, to tell the time. - I'm just making sure you're not screwing with me. Sundial to tell the time? - Mm hmm. - You don't use a watch? - No. I don't care much for electronics. - Not even a watch? - No, no, and I don't have video game systems, email. - [Ted] Come again? - I mean I don't use the internet. - At all? - At all. I have a landline. - A landline? They still make those? - Yeah. I mean they did an article on me in Chicago Magazine. - Really? - Yeah, you didn't read it? - No. - No? Basically I can get any table I want at a Chili's restaurant if it's before 5:30. - Huh. Is it difficult to get a table at Chili's before 5:30? - Some people recognize me. I've been recognized. - What's not to recognize, Norm? - Yeah. - Wow. - They got my good side. - Mm hmm. So Norm, what do you do for a living without these cell phones? - I'm in investments, I invest. - You're in investments? That's great, but the market's on the internet, isn't it? - No no no, I invest in businesses that I believe in. Not at the market, land of 1,000 douche bags. The market. - Market. - Yeah. - What's this number? - That is the bedroom phone. - The bedroom phone? I love it. (light music) - Stop the presses! - You're not gonna find what you're lookin' for over here. - What am I looking for? (scoffs) Hmm. You're sick of technology. You're tired of the world wide web. You're lookin' to cut yourself off. - How'd you know? - Your face says I'm sick of life, take me Lord. - My, my face? - Yes. Your face. Says come to me, Jesus, and end it all. - Oh, I don't know. - You a rotary guy? Or a wall jack? - Excuse me? - Now what you have here is a rotary phone. I don't suggest it for someone who likes to move around a lot. Two-foot cord. I mean, it could work for you. What are you, about five two? - I'm five seven. - (laughing) Yeah, right. And the fact that you have to dial in a clockwise motion. - Mm. - This is for someone who's more sitting, who doesn't want to move from their spot. But this bad boy. We jam this right into the wall. You can move back and forth, you can sit, you can lie down, lotta options with a phone like this. I mean technically you could with a rotary but you'd have to carry it around. - Oh, God. I don't know. - What kind of work do you do? You a salesman? Retail? - No, no, I'm a PR representative. - Oh, well, look at you! You're probably too fancy for one of these, mister fancy pants big PR rep. - No, no, no, I'll take the wall jack, the wall jack. - Fine choice, fine choice. - Alright, alright. - The cord. (laughing) - You're a working man. Look, I saw that when you walked in. I'll tell you what. I am gonna throw in a 15-foot long cord just for you. - Ooh. - Also. I'm gonna throw in a few classics for you. You're gonna have a phone in every room in your house. - I'm gonna take it, let's do this. How much? - 150. - 150 for a phone with a cord? That seems a little steep. - I thought you said he was serious about phones. - Dave. - Don't waste my time. - Dave. Hold on. Give it a shot. - Alright, alright, yeah, I'll take it, I'll take it, I'll take it. - You'll take it? - Yeah, yeah. - Did you not hear what I said? I said I was gonna throw in a few classics for you. - Makes sense, that 150 makes sense now. - I'll tell you what. I'll throw in an answering machine. - Well now yeah, 150 of course, of course. - The one with the cassettes, right? - Micro cassette. - I'm gettin' a steal then, it's a steal. - I don't take credit though, cash only. ATM down the street. - Yeah, we're gonna have to go do that. - We'll be back. - Be right back. (laughing) - Sucker born every minute. (classical piano music) - Hey, put that down, I wanna show you something. - Not right now, okay. One minute. (laughing) - Alright, with that enthusiasm level, I mean I could just not do this, that's fine too. Why am I even bothering? Alright, alright, alright, alright. Ready? A little something for our love dungeon. - The actually glory of cell phones is that we don't have to have this. We have people to call us on our cell phones, Ted. Are you having like a nervous breakdown? - You're not getting it. - Is this about that video? - Okay, okay. - He took it down, you know that right? It all went through, I made that happen. - I know, you make everything happen, babes. But you're not like, I'm trying to cut us down on technology and like... Okay, okay, okay. Remember when you were in junior high and you had some crush that you were like really into and you had one of these bad boys. And you would give him a buzz, - Mm. - and their mother would pick up and you'd be real nervous and you would talk about, you know, to your crush about whatever junior high kids talk about, pizza, right? But like, that was living, that, oh, was a good time. - God, that was so fun. I have a meeting in Chicago now, I'm gonna be so late. Can we please talk about this after? - Wait wait wait wait wait. Later today you have a meeting in Chicago? - Yes. - No, no no no. Kevin's bringing Liam over, I've gotta watch Liam, we're going to the park. I need, right, but I need someone here for the cable guy when he comes over and installs our phones. - Okay, getting legislation for women to get equal rights or let the cable guy out. Jeez Ted. I don't know, what will I do? - How about maybe all the pro bono work that you do all the time? You know, don't forget, I lost the promotion. We don't got all that kinda money comin' in. I could use you to help earn around here. Like, all you're ever doin' is helping other people. Pro bono, pro bono. Which is great, but like give me a little attention, give me a little love. - Wonderful. For years, Ted, you go to school to learn law. All sorts of law. Entertainment law, contract law, federal law, law law law. And then? You actually get to practice it. And for me, for people who actually need it. So if you have a problem with how much I'm getting paid, then you don't understand that I'm actually helping people stand up for themselves. - Pick up the phone, come on. Answer it for me, please. (sighs) - I was at work today. - Yeah? - Everyone saw this. Every single person at my office saw our sex tape. Guys were comin' up to me, high fivin' me left and right, saying, "Good job for being in a sex tape, man!" Do you know what I didn't do? Buy a phone with cords on it and lose my mind. How about that? - Okay, okay. Duly noted. - Keep it together, sexy. (light music) - I love you. - I love you, too. Now I have to go get ready, please. - How you like the new shirt? - I'd like it better if it was buttoned up. - I'm gettin' there. - All the way. (knocking) - I think that's K. K! - Hey! Ted. - How's it going? - [K] How you doin'? - Alright K, Cousin K, you know Larry. Larry, Cousin K. - How's it going, man? - So. - So show me where your pilot takes place. - Pilot, like? - No, no no, K speaks in cable. So you know, big TV fan. Anyways, it's where the setup is, the setup's over here. - Alright. - Yeah. Do you need Larry and I here to like leave for a little while? We can go to Applebee's, we can check out Friday's-- - No, you're all set. You're good to go. Here's the number for your residence. - That's it, huh? Oh, what do you know? Huh! This is fun. Am I wrong, am I wrong? Alright, I'm not wrong. Alright. - Oh my God, I haven't seen one of those. - Huh? Huh? This has gotta be great for you. - I love this, are you kiddin' me? Yeah, push it, there you go, come on. - I got it, I got it, I got it. Alright, okay. How do we do this, what do we say? - Just wing it, just wing it, just wing it. - Yeah, push record. - Alright, alright, alright. Wanna get a good one in here, you know. Alright. Hi. You've reached Ted Gout and Jack Gout. - And Cousin K. - And luscious Larry Valentine. What? - Okay, anyways, you can leave a message after the beep. Do I go beep? - No, just hit stop. - Okay, oh, yeah yeah yeah. - Just right there. - No the lid. - I got it, I got it, I got it. Alright, alright, alright. - We're done, we're good. - That was a good one, right? - Yeah, record a message on your 10th century answering machine. - Let's test all this out. I'll call Norm, tell him to come on by, you guys can meet Norm. - Who's Norm? - The one that's trying to live his life like he trying to piss off his daddy? You have fun with that one. - Haters gonna hate. - Bro! Yo! I love the '90s! Dope. Walkman with the headphones. - Oh, Walkman, absolutely man. - Let us thank the cannabis lord. While we thanking him, you do that. Cords, I got all these cords. You can tell this was the '90s. - Best of New Edition. I'll take that. Ah man, now that's music. (light music) Someone will be over between 10 and three today. Didn't you get a call about this yesterday? - Hey. It's three already. - Don't worry about it, man. We never actually come. Whoa. Dude. What are you doin'? Ted, this guy's a narc! - What? Wha? - You sent over a stool pigeon! - No! - What are you thinkin', man? I'm supposed to be on the job. (laughing) It's not funny, this is not funny. - So you were high, huh? Well this just keeps gettin' better. - You know the phone was supposed to be a means for people to communicate. Now it just seems like, like it offers 1,000 different ways for people to avoid direct communication. - Bro, who is this dude, really? Look, I order pizzas with my phone, I open the garage with my phone, I open car doors with my phone, I order gifts with my phone, I use Amazon, eBay, Livin' Social, Groupon, bootleg sites, get Christmas gifts, I watch porn on my phone, from four different sites, I have no viruses. Do you see this seven-inch screen? If it had a mouth and long hair that wasn't weave, feet with no corns like she really has a baby toenail, she got an ample bottom with no pimples on her booty and beautiful breasts with just the perfect nipples, I would never need a person in my life ever but my phone. (knocking) - Who's that? - Kevin! - Oh God! One minute. (jazz music) Sorry. Comin' through, comin' through. Ooh! (groaning) (coughing) - Hey bro, thank you for watching little Liam today. Ooh, is that an Uncle Sammy's? Oh, double meat. (sniffing) Why's it smell like Febreeze in here? Goddamn, you. Mm. You're high. Really? - I'm not high, I'm like medium, but it's all good, it's all good, I'm like medium. - Alright Liam, go sit on the couch and do nothing for two hours, nothing. Jesus, just give him a tablet or something. - A tablet? He's four. - He's five. Who has it? - K, do it. - My arch nemesis, cousin Kevin. - Still a degenerate after all these years, I see, eh K? Later. - Bye, sorry. Love ya. - Ted left. I can't run a campaign with missing components here. - What is wrong with you? Who would post this video? Who would do that? - I, I thought I took it down. - I thought I took it down. Oh come on, you idiot! - Come on Fiona, it's funny. - Timmy! - Oh come on, Fiona, it's funny! - Get me Ted on the phone, please. - Yes ma'am. - Hey, what about a show? - Check a newspaper for the times. - I don't get a newspaper. - I'm gonna check for the times and if you rat me out I will hurt you. - We'll call from the landline. - Holy crap. I haven't seen a Yellow Pages in forever. - What we gonna do with the miniature here? Like what do you do, little man? (whining) - We're going to the movies! (chatting and laughing) - [Man] Like you are, with a boxing ring. (laughing) - Wait a second, this is where we're going? I can't go in here. - Why can't you? I said we're going to the Biograph, Biograph. - I didn't know it was this Biograph. I am banned for life from this place. - For what? - I was recording some movies on my phone. - Pirating? That's stealing. - It was just for my own personal use. I wasn't gonna sell it. I can't do it, guys. I'm out. - Where you going, where's he... - I don't know, but I guarantee you he ain't getting there on time. Cable men never do. I've been waiting on my cable man for three years. - Ted, it's Fiona. Listen, I want to just let you know that the stakes, you know, for this account, it's just my legacy, your job, the business, you know, no biggie. - I got this. - Machine cut me off, get him back, get him back. Would you just please shut your mouth hole right now? Seriously, sit down, just sit there! Did I take my vitamin C today or did I not take my vitamin C? Timmy? - [Timmy] I think you did, yes ma'am. - Do you have Ted back? - [Timmy] No ma'am. - Can anybody do anything or am I runnin' the show myself? - So, bite to eat? - Where you wanna go? Hot dogs, hamburgers, hamburgers? - Burgers. - Can I just say that was sublime? - Oh dude. I never thought I'd say this, but that Chris Pratt is a handsome fella. Better than the stuff he was doing pattin' the dinosaurs on the head. And that Jessica Chastain, she was a rock (mumbles). - By the way, if I can see every Nancy Meyers movie high, I'd be in heaven. Oh, I don't think it was Jessica Chastain, though. I think it was Bryce Dallas Howard. Or was it Eddie Redmayne? I don't know, they all look alike to me. - I was just thinking. Kevin still has K's weed. And he's gonna be missing that. - Kevin. Yeah, we'll get it back from him when he comes to pick up Liam. - [All] Liam! (dramatic music) (orchestral music) - Oh God, okay, okay. Oh, why's she gotta make two-hour-long movies? I hate Nancy Meyers. - Why do the previews have to be 20 minutes? - Okay look. Just let me call Kevin, it's an emergency, I'll use my phone. - No, Kevin's number's in my phone. - What the hell is wrong with you? - [Jack] Whoa, whoa whoa whoa, what's the rush? Where are you going? - Nope. - Oh, my God! - What are you doin'? What are you doin'? Stop. Another step and you're dead. Alright, hang out here buddy, okay? Play with your Tamagotchi. Okay, alright, good boy. - Whoa, Kevin, relax, relax, back off man! Whoa. - Dude. - What the hell is goin' on? - Why don't you ask mister mid-life crisis what's going on here? Him and his friends got high and left my kid in your apartment all day! - You idiot. - Come on. - You moron! You have a child and you get high? What the heck is wrong with you? - Jeez! - How do you think it feels when your kid calls you and tells you he's been alone for two hours? - He called you? - Thank heavens! - Wait, he has a phone? He's five. Who's he callin', his mistress? - His father when his uncle neglects him! - Fine, look at him, he's right over here, it's all good. He's all good, come here buddy. Oh, yeah, he's fine, he's got, Well, he may be a little high, I don't know, he's got one shoe off. - A little high, that's-- - That was a joke! - that's great. - It was a joke! - Did you get into the booze, did you get into the pop, huh? Huh, are you okay? - He's fine, you left him with four guys watchin' stoner flicks, what do you expect? - Say goodbye to Uncle. - Bye Uncle. - Bye guy, see ya. Bye Liam. - Okay, the child. You put the child in danger. - Mmm... I wouldn't say, neglect that's such a dirty, filthy word. I would say, uh... Oh, I didn't tell you the part of the story where my husband was home the entire time and they were playin'. (laughing) You know. - What the hell has gotten into you? (groaning and laughing) Damn. - You do look good. - So good. Hey, I don't need you to tell me that, okay? Tell me I look smart. (groaning) - You know, I shouldn't even be watching kids anyways. Remember what I told you when you said you wanted a dog? - Yes. You said we don't need to buy anything that needs to be fed. Swoon. - What do you want for dinner, Chinese? (sighs) I'm still hungry. - Ted, no, I'm not hungry. You smoked! Without me! Like, that's our thing, right? Like I come home and you have it ready for me and we have a cute little moment and we like connect after a long day. And you endangered our nephew and you don't even seem to care! And you smoked without me man, like what's up with that? - So that's a soft yes on Chinese, right? (groans) - I like the stars. What do the stars look like to you? - Okay right over here I see titties. - I do too. Those are Madonna's titties. - Oh, damn. - And over here, Sharon Stone's titties. - Oh! - And oh, (laughing) they're touching each other. - Wow. Oh damn! Oh, she's got like a third nipple. - Yeah. You know they're older than us. Madonna and Sharon Stone are older than me and you. - Really? - And they look pretty good. - Oh my God, they look amazing. - They don't look as good as we do, but they look good, you know? - They don't look as good as we do. - No. (laughing) - I'm thinking about gettin' back into wrestling shape. - Seriously? - You know, I'm thinking about, you know. - Oh, wow. - I was a prime, you know, third in state in high school. - You were good. I will tell you this, you were good, but I could always put you in the half and get you down for the count., because no matter what you could not get out of the Windsor. - What are you talking about? - Oh come on. - Crazy. - You know what, I'll do it right now. I will do it, come on. - I don't even think you can sit up. - I will do it right now. - I'll give you $100 if you can sit up. - Oh go to hell. - Oh you're crazy. You're crazy. - Let me tell you somethin', now this is the truth. Nobody, nobody threw a curve ball like you and that is something I tell your son all the time. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Well, you know what? You had a very, very good hook too. - Well yes, I could always strike you out with it, that is true. - Well that is something. We did have some fun. Remember workin' on cars in the garage? We did that. - Oh, that was awesome, yes. - Or the bunk beds we had upstairs and we'd pee out the window. - Oh, that's right, oh! Dad got so pissed! - 'Cause he had to repaint the side of the house with the yellow streak! - That streak goin' right down. - Then we'd sneak out there to go see girls. - Oh man. - Do all that? - And then we'd get caught and he would kick the shit out of us. - He'd kick the shit out of us whether we got caught or not. - Yeah. (laughing) Yeah, he was kinda angry. - Yeah, he was very angry. - He was very angry. - Yeah. We lifted weights in the garage, that's probably why we lifted so much weights. - Yes! - We were getting ready. For the day when we'd take him on. - As protection. - Yeah. - Yeah, bastard died too soon. - [Chuck] Yeah, I was ready though, I always had your back. - You did. - Yeah. - You always did. - Yeah, I was ready. (light music) You know what, I think we should hit the jazz. Coltrane, Miles Davis. - Wait no no no, Kennedy's totally doowop. Yeah, it's more complete. It's like go up the hill in the Caddy and you got your chill music. - Are you crazy? So Kennedy is chillin' with chicks listening to Deon and the Belmonts? - Hell yes he was. - You're crazy. But what do I know? I was getting laid to Springsteen every night. - Oh please, who let you bang them to the Boss? - Oh a lot of people. Sophia Smothers. - Oh no, no no no. Stanky McJanky Smothers? (laughing) No! Stanky, woo! Whoa! - And Jenna Jockey. (laughing) Yeah. - Jenna Jawbone? - Yeah. - Let me tell you somethin'. I ran into her, I don't know, about three weeks ago. - Yeah, how'd she look? - Like us. - Oh my God, that's horrible. - It was heartbreaking. - That's disgusting. - You're reminiscing skanks girlfriends past again? - You left my nephew alone? - My grandson? - Yes, your grandson. - I would yell but I'm very hungry. - Oh, thanks for savin' me some joe. This'll keep me up for another two minutes. - It does stunt your growth. (groaning) - Somethin' stunted it. - I better go get dressed, gotta get ready for work. - Let me guess, he kicked you out. - [Ted] I left under my own accord. - Yeah. - Oh did you? Okay, okay. - Listen to me Teddy, go home, don't be a dummy. Okay how about this? What about Brenda? Brenda was hot. - Brenda was dirty. I liked that about her. She was dirty, she was a pirate and a hooker. - (laughing) Dirty pirate hooker! - And she had the, it was funny because she had the, she was missing a hand. And it was back when you could make fun of people for that. - Exactly. - She had the hook, ow. (imitates Brenda) - Yeah yeah yeah. - And sometimes she'd put the hook up my ass. - Yeah, well she put it up everybody's ass! - She nailed that prostate. - You'd get yelling-- - Wow! (light music) - Mr. Sandberg, Ryne. I like to look at the Cubs as right here but me and you together, we could put 'em up here. We can put them right there, big guy, yeah, there we go. There we go. Yes! - Remember, this place is nothin' without you. Ted, you helped build this place. They have this account because of you, okay? - Yeah. - You got this? - I got it. - You ready? - We got it, I'm goin' in. - Okay. - Ted. I need a coffee. Think you could grab me one? Or maybe a croissant? (laughing) - Carbs? - There are carbs in a croissant? - Bryce, other Bryce, how are you today? - Um, neither of us are Bryce. - Yeah, well nevertheless, Bryce, Bryce, we'll see you upstairs, goodbye. Oh hey listen, listen. Just practice what you preach, Ted. Let Fiona know how you feel, okay? Mission, truth-telling. Just walk up there and lay it out. Alright? Come on, you got this, let's do it. - Hi, I've been calling you all weekend, Ted. - There is no Ted, only Zuul. - What, do you not answer your cell phone anymore? - Oh, I'm getting out of the whole cell phone racket, Fiona. - What does that mean? - That means that I see the future. - Okay, just tell me, is this a Barry thing? - No no no no, Barry's your screw-up, not mine. - Okay, so, now that we're all here. - You know what? It's so funny, coming to work today. All the technology. Everyone's always on their phones. Kids with their heads buried in their phones all the time, walkin' and textin', drivin' and textin'. Everybody on their phones. Look at Google for brains over here. - Yeah. - Oh Barry. (overlapping voices) Remember the movie 2001: A Space Odyssey? It's a classic, it's a classic. Hal, you know how Hal turns on all of us, Barry? You know that? Do you know about that? You probably wouldn't, Barry. Because Barry, you should see 2001: A Space Odyssey. It was made in 1968, it's in color. It's a good movie. You know-nothing pre-2000 waste of human skin. - Okay, are we done with the film reviews now? I'm gonna say this once, and then we're gonna start this meeting and you're gonna get back to work if you want to continue to have a job here, okay? The more connected you are, the more opportunities that you have and the more opportunities you have, the more money you can make. If you can be on top of whatever product is hot at that moment, you can be king. Got it? We have Jacob and... - If someone doesn't put their foot down and lead the way, we are gonna go down a road with these tech companies that we cannot recover from! - (laughing) Okay, Ted. I apologize for the way that we're starting off. Jacob, could you please-- - Absolutely. - give us a big push there? Thank you my dear. - It's your fiction that interests me. Your studies of interplay and the human motive and emotion. Isaac Asimov. - You're fired. Fiona Sanders. I cannot have a breakdown today. I cannot have it. You have got one of the biggest players here in Chicago effing history and you are making a scene. - You can't fire me. Just because I don't want to be some droid, void of life? You can't fire me. Because I, 'cause I want to live naturally? - Just did. So sorry. We are... are going to hear these pitches which I have a very good feeling about. (somber music) - You! I remember you! You're the guy that almost hit me with the truck. I remember you, with the phone! - What, this phone? See you later buddy! - I'm back. You know, I was just thinking about something. If you wouldn't mind giving me one second of your time. Hey girl, hey. I was thinking about simple times and how much I miss 'em. - Oh. - [Ted] That's what I was thinking about right there. - You have lost your goddamn mind. - Hi Barry, yep, this thing's attached to your ear, Barry. Simple times, buddy. That's what I'm thinking about. What do you got there, Barry? Don't be scared. What do you got there, Barry? 500 people in this building, Barry, and you can't ask one of them to take your picture? Really? Is that how antisocial you've gotten? You know Barry, you don't understand the power that's in your hands. You're so entitled. I hate your stinking, breathing guts. (clapping) - I'm so sorry. - He's short, but we could use him on the bench. (orchestral music) - Hey. - Hi. Thanks for comin'. - I'm sorry if I'm working too much. - No, you're fine. You're helpin' out other people I love that about you. - [Jack] Thanks. - It's just, you know. I get a little jealous sometimes. - Why are you jealous? - 'Cause sometimes I want to have you all to myself. - Aw. That's sweet. I made dinner. - Oh did you? - Mm hmm. - [Ted] Yeah? - Couldn't get a reservation at Olive Garden. - Who deals with a hostess at Olive Garden? - [Jack] Me, Jack Gout. (laughing) (groaning and laughing) - You there, you awake? - Mm hmm. - Quit your job. - What? - Yeah, let's do what we said what we were gonna do when we retire now, let's quit our jobs. - I'm not quitting my job. - Oh. I quit mine. - You quit your job? - Well I mean technically I got fired. - Ted! - What? Like come on, we said we were gonna get an RV and travel and, you know, eat out of woks and read trashy novels. - Ted. I don't know how to react to you this week. We can't just quit our jobs. We don't have that kind of nest egg. We can't just quit working. - Sure we can. - No. Like literally we cannot. Would you consider seeing a doctor or something? Your weather and traffic is way off, babe. - A doctor? 'Cause I'm crazy? 'Cause my ideas are crazy? 'Cause the rest of the world's doing one thing and I'm doing somethin' else? Is that why I'm crazy? Did you ever think about maybe the rest of the world's crazy and I'm the normal one? But you know what? (laughing) I'm gonna write a book. I'm gonna travel. I'm gonna do it all without technology. And you know why? Because I'm Ted Gout. And if you don't like it, it's probably because I'm not like Barry or George. - George? George? That is what this is all about? (scoffs) What is your obsession with George? Why am I always chasin' after you? (soft music) (honking) (orchestral music) - Larry! (grunting) Or the trunk, whatever. - Whatever, whatever. Man. I needed this. I needed a break from tossing out bearded drunks with skinny jeans, I needed this. We goin' campin'! We goin' campin'! (laughing) - Ted. Look what I got. - [Ted] You got cassettes. - [Norm] Yeah, what do you think I got in here, clothes? (jazzy piano music) (growling) - Alright, Wisconsin. Beautiful summer day or what? Gorgeous! (soft harmonica music) Larry! - Ted! - I thought you were in charge of the cooler. - Yeah. I brought a cooler. - There's no ice, there's no brews, it's empty. - Yeah, I brought a cooler for campin'. - How much cash you got on you? - I got a couple of bucks. - Norm? - Nothin'. - No credit? - I don't have credit. - You're an investor, Norm. You don't have credit? - Um, not when they all go under and you have to declare bankruptcy. (chuckling) (light music) - Oh no. You told me to cut the technology, to cut the cord. You told me I didn't need it. That you're an investor, you invest money, Norm. You didn't need it. - Yes, after my surgery, I dropped technology and I became an investor. Those investments, you ever hear of penny stocks? - Oh God. - Well I mean technically-- - Larry, butt out! Wait, what surgery? - I used to get epileptic seizures, yeah. They took part of my brain out. (clicks) Now I'm all good. - No. All the big talks, all the life-changing affirmations, even you got a cell phone, Norm? - It's for emergencies, Ted. I never use it. - You got it! God you're stupid, Norm. - I'm not stupid. My mom makes me carry it. - That's a little over the line, Ted. So what? He has a phone? These Walkmans, compasses, this SUV, even your landline were all new technology at some point. I mean, snap out of it, look at you. You were about to kill Norm and for what? A cell phone he rarely uses? This was fun for a while, Ted. A few days to be exact. But come back to reality. You alright? Cool. (bright music) - Hey brother. It's cool, we got plenty. - Your wife growled at me. - Yeah, that's how she says hello. Come chill for a bit. - So, how you feel about having a black dude at your campsite? - It's cool Larry, just keep smilin' so we can see you. (chuckling) - We gonna keep prayin' for that chair. Alright. (chuckling) - Lighten up, will ya? Look around you, we're all having a great time. - That's my girl. Isn't she the best? So what's the story, you guys married or what? - Oh no, not for me, no, absolutely not. - No. - What about you, Teddy? - Yeah, I'm married. - Where's your wife? Boy's weekend? (cell phone rings) - [Larry] Oh shit. - What? (cell phone rings) - We gon' get on up outta here. - Where the hell's he goin'? - I got my Fig Newtons in there. Hey, what's your problem, man? - Get outta there! - [Ted] What do you need this for? You don't need this, you're camping! - [Wife] Let me get him. (blow thudding) (groaning) (orchestral music) - Hey guy, can I use your phone? - No. - Is there a payphone around here? - They still have those? There's a cell phone store right there. - Okay. Sure, no problem. Yeah, and I'll sign you up tomorrow. I gotta go, a creepy dude just walked in. Hi, I'm Chaz, can I help you? - I need to make a phone call. - Don't we all? That's why we're here. - No, no, I need to make a call. - Please don't, sir, don't touch the phone, okay? Don't touch it. Let me show you the Ultanium. - The Ultanium? - Look at that. Yeah, it's between platinum and ultimate, the Ultanium. - If you're ultimate already, right, you're like ultimate, why do you need to be platinum? It doesn't really matter. I just need to make one call please. - Please sir, don't touch my phone. - Okay, okay. - Look at this Ultanium, are you kiddin' me? This baby's got a camera that'll blow the red away. Okay, look at that. And, and, it's got a GPS in the sky. Ain't that awesome? Plus it'll take your fingerprints and store all your information, and guess what? You never have to worry about your information again, you know why? Hey, look at me. 'Cause it's right here on the Ultanium. - Can I like stick my tool in it and screw it? - Well sir, that's disgusting, but no. Not on this version. - Maybe I wasn't being clear. I just need to make a phone call. - [Chaz] On the phone. - No, on your shoe, guy. Yeah, on the phone. - You're getting irate. - [Ted] (groaning) Can I just-- - Sir, don't touch my phone. - Okay, I don't need a new phone, I got a phone, I got two phones. I had two phones. - [Chaz] Sir, take a breath. - This did nothing for me. - So that's a no on the phone? - [Ted] That's a no. That's a no. - Asshole. Hello? Yes, thank you. (bright music) - [Ted] And uh, that's how we got to where we are? - Sometimes we get downtime. Because we're the suburbs, we don't get as many criminals as the city does, so. In our downtime we crack some jokes. So here, I got an old joke for you. This guy's out in a boat, he's in the middle of nowhere in the ocean, he's lost, prayin' to God. And so the boat comes by. Boaters look at him and go hey, you need some help? Guy goes no, I got faith in God, I'm gonna be fine. So they pull away and then a helicopter comes by, sees the guy, comes down, hey buddy, you need some help? He says no, no, I got faith in God, I'm gonna be fine. Helicopter goes away. Couple of days the guy dies. Goes up to heaven, he meets God. He says, God, what happened? I had faith in you and you didn't help me. And God says, "I sent a boat and a helicopter, "what the hell are you doing here?" - That's good, I mean it's uh, I'm not a God guy so I don't know if I'm following the point. - Your husband, wife, whatever. He asked to help. Your boss asked to help you, your friend Larry. You really want to find out the hard way that that's the only help you're ever gonna get? (knocking) - Oh, divine intervention. - Okay, you can go now. - You know Ted, it's alright not havin' all the answers. In fact, sometimes knowin' that you don't know all the answers is the most important thing. 'Cause then you can truly be. But when it comes to your husband... The best part of this job is when I get to ask questions and listen. You'd be amazed how far that'll get you. - Thank you. - Don't be such an asshole. - Turns out a pedestrian was recording with his phone the robbery inside the store. He posted it on YouTube, owner identified the thief, the department sends their deepest apologies. - YouTube. - Please, YouTube saved you, pal. - A turd this big. Your fat ass? Yeah, okay, okay. - I had a turd that big but it didn't stand a chance. When you took a look at me, I clenched. - Yeah, I bet you did. - [Ted] Oh shit. - I called Jack, he didn't pick up, so when I called your dad they were on the golf course and they insisted I come get 'em. - Hey, hey you. Get your butt in the car right now. - You took us off the golf course. What did I tell you about the goddamn golf course, Teddy? Huh, you little turd? - Hey, where you goin'? Get back here! - Out in, in out, what do you want me to do? Where do you want me to go? What are we doin'? - [Chuck] Hey watch it, smart-ass. - Okay, the golf course is sacred, okay? That is my time away from the world. - Listen to me. I hate the internet. I hate phones. Ever since your mother abandoned us with that guy from MySpace-- - His name was Tom. - I told you never to mention his name again! - My bad! - Alright? - Yes, yes, Tom will never be said out of my mouth again. - But the internet is a part of our life now. It's an evil that we have to face, okay? It's like anal warts. It's somethin' we have to deal with. And if you don't deal with the internet, son, you're gonna end up alone. And it's gonna be sad, okay? So here's what we're gonna do. Now you married up. So we're gonna go home and you're gonna apologize. 'Cause you don't wanna lose this marriage because of somethin' on Google, are you kidding me? - He met someone. - What? - The Latin guy. - Oh, Christ. - Yeah, on Facebook. - Well, then you're gonna fight. Not the Latin guy, 'cause he'd kick your butt. - Oh, he'd kill him. - Maybe if he was an Asian you'd have a chance. - Asian, maybe. - You're gonna fight for your marriage, okay? Listen to me. I didn't raise an asshole, okay? Steve here, Steve is an asshole. - Oh, go to hell, everyone loves me. - Son. Let's go home and make this happen. Alright? Hey. Let's fight for this. Hey, remember. - Yeah? - Your guy, he's the best. Son. You're not so bad yourself. - Thanks Dad. - Hey, yo yo yo, listen to me. Beg for your damn job back, okay? Tell them you got that PTSD thing from technology or some bullshit like that because they cannot fight that. - Alright Uncle Stevie, that's what I'm gonna do. - Okay. - Good, good idea. - You're a good one, dummy. - Oh God, I'm too late. George, that's my husband. Okay. I know you've been a better man than me lately. I know you've been listening to him and I haven't been listening to him. I know you've been spendin' time with him, I know you've been talkin' to him about his work, and why wouldn't you? Jack's a superhero. Fightin' for equality every day. I get it, and here I am, I'm pissin' away my marriage. - [Jack] Shut up. - Alright, look, okay. I knew your husband in high school. Alright, we were best friends. And also we've never had sex and I promise you we never will. I mean, to be quite honest, he's not my type. Hold on, did you, did you tell him? - [Jack] No, I didn't. - So he doesn't know. - [Jack] He does not know. - Okay. I'm gonna share somethin' with you and promise that you'll just listen? I was assigned a vagina at birth. - Ted, George was once Georgeanne. - No, I never really was Georgeanne. That was all my assigned name and sex. But I've always been George. - (exhaling) Wow. (laughing) Ah, wow. You know, a wise guy told me I need to ask more questions. Do a little more listening. Now probably would have been the time to do that, huh? - I'm gonna, you know I'm gonna leave you two be. Come here. Just tell him you love him, Ted. - George moved back to town last month and didn't really have any friends. A lot of people weren't very kind to his reassignment surgery. It's been a process to say the least. That's why I've been hangin' out with him so much. - I know I've been a little crazy lately. But um... if you'll still have me, I'd like just one thing. - What's that? - I just want moments. I just want moments with you. - Ted. Ted, I will give you moments for the rest of your life, forever more and always. Okay? We'll work on it, together. But Ted, all I've ever wanted from you was at the end of the day, you come home. (gentle music) Oh God. Your meltdown at work? A million views. Viral. Your boyfriend Barry recorded it. - Oh my God. Come on. - Ted.

Timmy, come here honey. It's about to get better. Timmy, why don't you sit right here and share with Ted what you shared with me this morning. - Do I have to? - [Fiona] Yes sweetie, you have to. - Barry... touched me. - Gross. Does that surprise you? - Well, actually Ted, can I just get a selfie with you? My classmates would freak. - Well that is so cute, that is so cute. So Ted, this little production of Glen Garry Glen Ross that you put on in my office the other morning has hit the internet like hotcakes. Yeah, people are praising you, they love your rants on technology. (laughing) And yeah, of course, Barry is an immature pervert which you know, we're screwed. I would tell you that you're still fired but I don't think that there's much of a firm left so it really doesn't ma-, why are you laughing? - Fiona? Hi. Relax, 'cause we got the solution. - Why, why live? I'm scared, I'm scared, but a little bit excited. Tell me something good. (dramatic music) - Get off the phone, you'll want to experience this. (grunts) - I heard he's throwin' some hooks. - Alright. (bat knocks ball) (cheering) - [Announcer] Chicago Cubs baseball. Bringing generations together. - I don't, how did you, what, how? - So we're gonna take this to the Cubs. And tell them that we want 10 more of these commercials. Bringing generations together by playing the game. Bring your kids and actually spend quality time together. Put down the phone, get in the game. - Oh. Oh. I don't know what to say, you can smile now. - You're gonna say that Ted gets his job back. - Of course. - Ted. Teddy. We just want you to know, we had your back the whole time. - The whole time. And we just want you to know how much we have to offer. You know as like a team. - I will make out with you right now. Hard. Like I really will do it. I am not above sleeping with you to keep my job. - Jeffrey. - Shut up. - God. - Wow, alright. We're gonna need as many hands on deck as possible. I mean, this is Fiona Sanders PR and they know everything we're doing here and everything, I mean, yeah, I mean I don't see any harm in keeping them around. Why don't we send them on their first mission? Four coffees, boys. Oh, and a bourbon for the lady. - Light bourbon. - Oh yeah, okay. Fiona, I really, really owe my husband a house. - Oh do you? - Yeah, and I would say a 10% raise would probably go a long way towards making that happen. - 10%. Yeah. - [Ted] I love you. - I love you too. I love you so much. - Alright, Ted. My friend, you are never gonna get this lucky again so go ahead and make love to your sweet man right here in my boardroom. - I'm gonna. - That's right. - Thank you. - Oh yeah, this is so going viral.
