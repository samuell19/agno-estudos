[Aggie] Would you be gentle? I won't no have that time to get used to you. - I've never been up close with a man. - I know you need someone... Lot's of people do. - Richard, you up? You are something, Richard. Napping right through that awful whistle. My nerves are on edge. Get up, you won't be able to sleep good tonight. Come on, my darling man. I'll make you a good strong cup of tea. - Thank you. But I don't drink no tea. Foolishness, you do mine, because I brew it so good. It's strange around here today. Like something's hidden, about to come out. Remember, I told you how strange I felt that day. Even before I'd seen you. What was it like, Richard? I keep mulling it in my head, but it slips away. You wished for someone to come. And I did. - Eased my loneliness, I can say that. Being with me all these years. Something's coming over me. Has been. I guess a girl way out here with no play friends starts imagining things. You were so strong and handsome. And you, you had sparkling eyes like a princess, a real princess. I was young then too. And beautiful. My hair was golden blond. Didn't know anything about real men. I remember, ma told me it wasn't time yet. And us staying out here away from things. I hardly ever seen a man. Not my age, anyway. But I was feeling something. Inside. I didn't know what it was. I used to make things up. Yes. A bridge. It must have happened that way. - Never seen you before. - Never seen you. You from here? House is up there. - You're Aggie, ain't you? I'm from over that way. - Never seen you before. - Never seen you. Hey, wait up. Walk you home? Ma says it's bad. To be alone with a man. - Ain't bad. Just walking you home. Oh. Oh, oh. Oh, oh, oh. I feel funny. I do too. Wonder what it could be. Being close maybe. I never been. Me neither. I feel funny. Wait. Don't go. I got something to show you. - What? - A surprise. It belonged to my great-grandparents. You don't have to worry, folks ain't home. You can come in if you're ready. It's all right now. - [Richard] What is? To touch me. Your eyes sparkle. Please, please. What is it? - I don't know, I don't know. Do you believe in fairytales? - You mean like a prince coming to take you off? - Yes, like that. I guess I never gave it much thought. It'd be nice if it could happen that way. Yes, it would be. - Do you think I'm pretty? [Richard] Yes, and your eyes sparkle so. No, no. I don't want it that way. Something bad happened. Why you let me go on that way, Richard. - You just like to remember something happened that way. - I just like to remember it happened that way. - You never had no golden hair. And you never were no prince either. Sometimes, I don't know the difference between wishing and happening anymore. Water's cooled off. Gotta wait til she boils up again. There weren't no fairytale, I know. I wasn't bad, just because. I wasn't bad. When weren't you bad? The first time you come. I wasn't, I remember. Only reason you got to me that first time was because I was locked up in this place. And I was ripening. Been that way for some time, I think. Ever since my pa run off. I swear my mom become crazy then. Treating me so cruel. Like it was my fault he run off. Never allowing me out. Wonder, wonder how I found about loving with myself. Guess it was natural. Only thing I'd do of course. I was so alone. I had only myself. [Man] Hey. Hey. Anybody home? Hello? Hey, you? What you want? Up here, up here. What you want? You Aggie, ain't you? Where's your ma? What you want her for? - Oh, I'm delivering the hay she asked for. Why didn't you let me in when I called? I can't. Ma's got me locked up. You must a done something bad, her locking you up like that. Hey, Aggie. Aggie? Hey, Aggie? Aggie. Aggie? I'm sorry. Didn't mean nothing. You're gonna catch cold. Said I was sorry, Aggie. Hey. Aggie. Aggie? Aggie, I didn't mean nothing, saying you were bad. Ain't been bad. Ever. Why ain't I ever seen you in town, Aggie? - Ma won't let me. Says it's a bad place. But you're all grown up. Pretty too. She shouldn't be looking you up like this. - I was thinking. Ain't never been up so close with a man before. Except my pa before he run off. What else you thinking? Maybe I am bad. You're not bad. Just growing up. - It's so lonely. So crazy. It's growing up. Something bad in me. Don't know what's wrong with me. It's all right, girl. That's your nature. It's everybody's. I care about you. He said I wasn't doing anything bad. So why can't I get past it? Every time I think I remember something, my head fills up with blood. I can't see no more. What happened? [Richard] You just like to remember something happened that way. Weren't that way at all. Maybe I did make it up. Maybe I was bad. Maybe that's why I can't remember. Why do I even have to? How'd she get in here? Damn you. I told you to stay outta here. Damn thing. I didn't, I didn't notice, did I? Yeah. Seems to me I had one once. Pretty thing, yes. I used to put perfume on it. It had a red velvet bow around her neck. That's the other way, ain't it? It came to that house where I was. Over in the mill town across the river. Not that I needed any money then, I didn't have bills. I was crazy to be with someone. Couldn't get that ache outta me. Men paid to be with me. He came. He wanted to take me outta there. Touch me. Feel me. Wet your finger. You excite me. It feels good. Oh yes. Feel my thighs. Caress me. It's nice. You do that nice. Oh. Oh, yes. Higher. That's it, that's it. Oh, that's nice. Oh please, put your, oh, put it in me. Oh yes. Ohh. Oh, you do that well. Oh, I love it. Oh yes. Ohh. Soft. Ohhh. Feel me. Love me, oh, love me. Oh, nice. Oh. Hold my ass. Oh, grab me. Oh, yes. Oh fuck me good, fuck me in my ass. Oh yes. Oh that's right. Oh yes, oh yes. Oh you've got me. Do it. Please. Oh, love me. Oh, please. Oh, good. Oh. Oh yes. So sweet. - No. No. It weren't that way. I never had no cat around me. I hate the damn things. Why'd I even made up I done that? Working at some whorehouse. I still got that loneliness. It's past my time of dreaming about a man. Now, it's dead in me. What's happening that stops me from remembering? Was it so terrible? You're a good man, Richard. Maybe you're protecting me from my memories. Not telling. I remember when you once asked me not to try to remember. [Richard] I'm here now. You wished for me to come. I did. Yes. Only on certain days, I can't seem to recall. My Lord. You haven't had your tea yet. You've been a comfort to me. You didn't wanna stay at first. That's it. You was lost. So lost you was. - Not lost. Searching. Searching the face of the Earth for something. While all the while it was right here with me. I showed that to you. I saved you. I remember... going over to the church a lot. I was closest to him in the evening. I recall I'd made peace with myself, for the loneliness of all them years. It was way past my time about dreaming of any man. Not in this world, anyway. The strange burning feeling inside me weren't gone, but it didn't trouble me no more. I knew it was meant for him. For the adoration of him. I was saved. - Why you here? What you want? Just passing through. I ain't gonna hurt you. Wait there a minute. Don't I know you? Seen you before. Sorry. No way to treat a stranger. You're welcome here, especially if you're in need. Well, been traveling a long while. - You frighten me. I'll be going. - Wait up. I felt I knew you. But I don't, do I? Strange like. Need some wood chopped back at the house. If you oblige, I'll fix you something to eat. Must be hungry, traveling about like this. - [Richard] Where you want these? - Oh, you can lay them over there by the stove. Making you a good strong cup of tea. - Thank you. But I don't drink no tea. - Foolishness, you will mine, I brew it good. You can wash yourself up in the bathroom. I'll bring you something fresh to put on. You don't talk much. - Nothing much to say. - It's old, it was my great-grandfather's. - Thanks. I got lots of things, pretty things. I own a deal good land around the house. My folks left it to me. I got an orchard out back, and a vegetable garden and. What have you got that on for? I think I better be getting on. What for? I made you something to eat. I'm afraid I've upset you too much. Wait some, please? Just that there ain't been nobody around here for a long while. Please? Got it all made. Men like yourself shouldn't be traveling around all by yourself. It's what I want. You should be with people. Someone. - Wouldn't work out. - Why not? Most people make you into something else. What they want you to be. I'd rather be alone. Sound lost. - Not lost. Searching. I was searching too. Til he come to me. Now you come to me. I knew you would. You wished for someone to come. I did. It could be any other. - No, I knew it was you as soon as I seen you. I knew you'd come in the evening. First time you come, I had beautiful golden hair. - You never had no golden hair. And you were so strong and handsome then. And you, you had sparkling eyes, like a princess, a real princess. - Why'd you say that? Just like to remember something happened that way. Nothing happened. I'm making things up, I'm helping you. I wasn't bad. I wasn't bad. When weren't you bad? Ma had me locked up. The first time you come, you said I wasn't bad. - You're making things up. - That time, you found me in my house. You don't hate me for it? I don't hate you. Would you, would you stay? - For the night. Only for the night. You'll be comfortable. You can sleep in the memory room. I call it that because all the old things are kept there. It's my favorite place in the whole house. The bed's over 100 years old. You'll like it there. I've come to see if you're all right. - [Richard] Fine. I'm sorry I behaved that way. I guess being alone gets to you. - I guess it does. If you want, only if you want, you can stay on as long as you want. I won't be no trouble to you. I'll let you rest now, you must be exhausted. - [Richard] Thank you. But I gotta be getting on in the morning. I understand. Night to you now. Night now. I changed my mind. If that's all right. I thought I'd wear this here dress. It was my great-grandmother's. It's very pretty. Would you be gentle? If you're going, I won't have no time to get used to. I ain't never been up close with a man. I know. You need someone. Lot's a people do. I'll save you. - No. I don't know why I keep coming back to it. I couldn't have done that. I didn't need no one. I was past my time of feeling about a man. I'd made peace with myself. And you're here now. Course you are. Here I am. Trying to remember again. But forgetting about your tea. I don't know how you put up with me all these years. [Richard] Thank you, but I don't drink no tea. Foolishness, you do mine because I brew it so good. I just don't know why I can't remember how you come here. On certain days I, I just can't seem to recall. What was it like, Richard? I remember. I felt strange like. Something's coming over me. Had been. Guess a girl way out here with no play friends starts imagining a lot. You were so strong and handsome then. Didn't know anything about real women, I remember. Ma told me it wasn't time yet. And us being way out here, away from things, I hardly ever seen a man. Not my age anyway. But I was feeling something, inside. Didn't know what it was even. Used to make things up.
