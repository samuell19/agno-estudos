- Shall we start? - Yes, let's start. April 6th 1954, Bogotá. "Dear Carlos, you arrived at your oldest age," "far from us," "fulfilling your duty to prepare yourself for action," "for thought," "to serve yourself and serve others," "for the life that God wants to give you" "with satisfactions, with accomplishments." "21 years ago my eyes became wet." "Before the wonder of your birth," "with your first cry," "and the most tender smile of your mother." "I want you to know how to build your life," "and be prepared when defeats or struggles put us to the test." What else did you ask the child-God? On a glorious day, black bearded white skinned men arrived on three curious ships to the unknown lands that would form America's continent. When my brother died I inherited all these boxes but I didn't know what was in those boxes. You had no idea? No, in fact the 8mm footage was a surprise for me. And negatives, there were many negatives. He took lots of pictures, practically every day. My father was an anthropologist. From the beginning, his main objective was the indigenous cause. We heard a loud detonation at 2 or 3 in the morning. We all ran outside immediately. A bomb was dropped at the entrance of the house, which damaged the house, destroyed windows and reached part of the roof. It was a great commotion, not only in our house, but in the neighborhood. Some views pointed to the conservative party. Or landlords who were upset and worried about the indigenous campaign that my father was running. While listening to the words of Carlos, I tried to think about how was his time. How he would have been at the time of the bomb. Dear homeland I have an enemy. Drunkenness. These Indians are like dogs. Begin with the Doctrine. These Indians are like dogs, dogs. Because they live like animals. How do you say, I believe in God? A bomb was dropped in the house of Gregorio Hernández de Alba Who were? Who were? The dogs. No, it was The Birds. Those that only appear at night. You mean a parrot. The land belongs to the Indigenous people. A few years a friend of the family, called to tell me that he had found the 8mm films of his father, an ethnographer. Gregorio Hernández de Alba. After projecting the films Carlos showed me the manuscripts, the letters, the photographs, the negatives. All the documents that his father kept for years in boxes. He began to tell me about his father's life and each of the expeditions he made, to La Guajira, to Tierradentro, the trip to the Second World War, the death of his father. What happens next, is just a fragment of that conversation with Carlos. A conversation that has lasted for years. Happened in different moments and was recorded in this diary. It begins with Hernández's first expedition to La Guajira. Tell me Carlos, how was the expedition to La Guajira. La Guajira 1935. First expedition. La Guajira was my father's first expedition. He was a delegate of the Colombian government to work with professors from US universities. Dad was the only Colombian. Field notes of the 1935 expedition to La Guajira. The Guajiros Indians, drum solos and jaw harp. "The Spanish conquerors arrived in the peninsula" "and went into Cabo de la Vela." "The Indians offered them their precious pearls." "But as the Spanish declared war" "the tribes armed themselves and the battle began." "Wayuu Indians learn how to use the bow from a young age." "They trained shooting the birds and lizards." "Due to their nature and way of living" "they have developed strong instincts to follow footprints" "of animals and people." "The heat is unbearable," "sometimes I want to send everything to hell!" "Go no further with this." He traveled to La Guajira as a government official in charge of monitoring the work of the Americans. The Indians of Sierra Nevada play the flute. For Dad La Guajira was a starting point, which he considered very important in his life. Observing the Americans, Hernández learned the technique. A true savage, a child raised by the wolves a wolf child. An indelible memory came into my mind the day of the conversation. Just remembering it makes me want to break this notebook. That expedition to La Guajira was the first one for dad. Whilst hearing his story of La Guajira I remembered some unwanted images that haunt me like a shadow. June 2nd, 2006. Today we arrive at an indigenous neighborhood. Close to the border between Argentina and Paraguay. On a glorious day, black bearded white skinned men arrived on three curious ships to the unknown lands that would form America's continent. We arrived at the hunter's house, a true nomad. He welcomed us, but today he won't be able to go hunting. We should come back tomorrow. As we had nothing to do, we wandered around the neighborhood. Black bearded white skinned men. June 3rd. Today we went back to the hunter's house. Once again he won't be able to go hunting, we should return tomorrow. As we had nothing to do we wandered around the neighborhood. We arrived at Achilai's house. He's been waiting for us for days. As soon as he sees us with the camera, he puts on the feathers and starts playing his tin violin. He tells us the story of a pig that travels looking for his bird friend, the Ipakarai. He started drinking and the story of the bird finished. June 13th. Once again he couldn't go hunting, maybe another day. We should come back next week. June 8th, 11th, June 15th, 20th. Today he told me that he was sick. He won't be able to go hunting. I must return next year. He will welcome us again. We then filmed the wedding of the hunter's son. On a glorious day, black bearded white skinned men arrived on three curious ships to the unknown lands that would form America's continent. From that day new routes, knowledge and wealth were opened into the world. Wonderful discoveries began to take place. To conquer the almost indomitable land with mountains and jungles. Lost in that conversation I wrote down every character that appears in this movie. The first one: the ethnographer. The second: Carlos, his son. The third: Pero López. Pero López is the shadow of your father, and not only of your father, Pero López is the shadow of all ethnographers. Your anthropologist uncle, Roberto found inside my father's boxes where all the documents were stored, an audio tape with the recording of a radio soap opera, written by my father called "Stamps of the Conquest." Based on a novel he wrote in 1936. Your uncle Roberto, the anthropologist. That day during the conversation with Carlos, something happened, that could help to understand the spirit of the ethnographer. My uncle Roberto, an anthropologist and his friend, found his father's radio soap opera "Stamps of the conquest." According to compilations and writings of the Colombian ethnologist and writer Gregorio Hernández de Alba. The character of the radio soap opera written by Hernández is a vulgar Spanish of the sixteenth century, a common conqueror. One amongst many to step on the new world, and be called Pero López. These are the true "Stamps of the Conquest." The narrations that he left us in old and blurry papers, evidence of how he loved the Indians. He approached their customs and tried to understand the reaction of their spirits. Pero López, who was born in León, Spain, was a prisoner released on the sole condition that he embarks on a ship to America. Pero López said that when he disembarked, some men told him: "From now on your name will be Pero López." That's how thousands of Pero López came to America. You'll be called Pero López. Damned Pero López! Pero López was born in León, Spain. The character of the radio soap opera. The first is... "He is dead" "He was here" Very good memory. He remembered everything. Each day, all the dates. Then he told that to someone else who signed as Pero López. An illiterate, but a chronicler after all. This is our legacy. Pero López. Spanish scum. Scum. On a glorious day, black bearded white skinned men arrived on three curious ships to the unknown lands that would form America's continent. Pero López obeyed the orders of Francisco Pizarro, and together they toured the mountains of Tierradentro. There he met the Paez Indians of whom he wrote in his diary, they are fierce warriors who eat human flesh. The natives of this land are dirty and poor, eat human flesh and are warlike mountain people. They fight with heavy spears of thirty meters or longer. In spite of this they have great advantage over us in dexterity. Many live in very harsh mountains, eat human flesh and sin in the nefarious. We found plenty of sausages in their houses, some were in fire. Some local experts warned me that were human flesh sausages. In many places we found the figure of the devil as a trophy. They worshiped it as we do with God. OK, read the other text and make a pause at the end. "You must know how to protect your soul," "so no one touches it unless it's to enrich it." "Let that Kipling phrase guide your life." "You are a man my son," "a man owner and master of himself." "Yours, Gregorio." What is this letter? It's a letter my dad sent me when I turned 21 years old. In that birthday letter Hernández quotes a phrase from Kipling. Kipling is influenced by his era. Like his poem, "The White Man's Burden." Send to the front the best among all of you. To serve against tumultuous and wild nations. To those recently conquered and unhappy people. Half devil, half children. Close to the objective consider laziness and ignorance. Bring hope nowhere. Today I could relate his voice to his image. Hello. It sticks in my mind. The Colombian Amazonia. We went with him to most of the excavation's expeditions or his chats with the indigenous. His second trip. Tierradentro expedition of 1936. Tierradentro was the first expedition where he took mum, my brother and me. We had to travel two days on horseback to get to Tierradentro. Strenuous days. Dad was mainly dedicated to discovering and documenting the tombs. He always told me that the first day I ran joyfully. It was great! Field notes on the expedition to Tierradentro in 1936. Probably this mysterious culture of Tierradentro succumbed to the bellicose Paeces Indians. Current inhabitants of this territory. Hernández's hypothesis suggests that the mysterious men who created the tombs and stone figures of Tierradentro, were annihilated by the Paeces or Nasas Indians. Current inhabitants of Tierradentro. Hello. What would be the place, where would you like to go? Colombia, Tierradentro. If it was the last place. A commission of archeologists was sent yesterday to the Cauca region. The missing link of the Atlantis has been found in Tierradentro. Tribe. Fierce. Devil. It's false. It's false. Looking for places where there could be statues. - Those were very busy days! - Fossil and material remains analysis. He became an archeologist. What's going on? Juan Pablo, what happened with the Christmas tree? It fell down. What is the Christmas tree for? It is for the arrival of... Isabelita, for the arrival of whom? - The child-God. - Is he coming? - Home? - Yes. What are we going to do with the turkey? We are going to kill it on Christmas. - Why are we going to kill it? - To eat it. - On Christmas eve? - Yes. - When the child-God arrives? - Yes. What are we going to do with the feathers? We will eat them, eat them! - I know what we should. - We should take them out. A feather crown, as the Indians use. Hello. I don't believe in that God anymore. I believe in God. You name him so calmed. Assassins! From that day on new routes knowledge and wealth were opened into the world. Wonderful discoveries began to take place. What did you ask the child-God? The Colombian Amazonia. How was his relationship with Catholicism? Dad was born in a very conservative family. My grandfather was a leader of the conservative party. While getting involved with his ethnology studies he began to strongly disagree with the Catholic church. Mainly with the role of the Missions in Colombia. I found the fourth and last character. An exota. He who defies the unknown is an exota. I would like to be one. First I have to find a hunter. That's the first condition, travel to the land of the nomads. And if necessary, your entrails will be pierced. If you want to be an exota. Tierradentro, September 29th, 1936. I am sure that these wanderings around Tierradentro, were very fruitful since I've learned a lot in these tricky hills. It was worth the sacrifice of a wild life, when doing field work. Fortunately it has its charms and is often very attractive and diverse. At the end of the letter my father says: "Let me tell you that these Paeces Indians of San Andrés," "my supposed friends," "made me witchcraft about a month ago." "They made a special party," "they killed a pork, there was chicha, lots of chicha." "The sorcerer was specially brought from Tumbichucue," "which is the heart of the Paez people." "The witchcraft was meant for the 'friendly doctor' to get away from their lands" "and never find their ancient treasures." "Hopefully, this witchcraft makes me return back to Bogotá soon." Professor Paul Rivet, Director of the Musée de l'Homme. Conversation about a war. Conversation about nationality. I believe in God. Rivet asks him. A Nazi. The purpose of dad's trip was to study ethnology at the Musée de l'Homme, under the direction of Paul Rivet. With this objective and together with the National Center of Science Research, we present tonight Pierre... In this museum you will learn that the concept of purity is appalling. I would say types, miscegenation. Director of the Musée de l'Homme. He is not looking if they belong to a race, the term doesn't suit anymore. He simply seeks to determine the percentage of certain human types in a given population. In your field research you will have to study them, measure their heads, record their language, absolutely everything to understand the origin of the American man. Lastly you will have to show them the flag. We are Colombians. Everything went quiet, until Germany declared war on France. The French tried to resist but the Germans quickly defeated them. They arrived in Paris, with Germans everywhere. Dad took many pictures, of the Germans in their parades, visiting the Arch of Triumph. What was going on at the Musée de l'Homme? In the Musée de l'Homme, all the windows were closed, with sandbags for protection, in case of bombing they would not be hurt. Rivet was part of the resistance movement against the Nazis. When the Germans arrived, Rivet had to escape. A short time after the Gestapo arrived, 11 collaborators of the Musée de l'Homme were imprisoned. All the ethnologists and disciples of Rivet were imprisoned and shot the same day. Professor Paul Rivet Director of the Musée de l'Homme. His theory on the multiracial suggests that man is a miscegenation product. In contradiction with the purity of race of the Nazi regime. Inside his box I found a dream, a dream with naked women. The mist. Wet and dry at the same time. As in his dreams, Gregorio suddenly wakes up exalted with a voice that is not his. He begins to recite the adventures of a miserable Spanish soldier of the sixteenth century. Everything becomes dark. The ideas of an unhappy soldier lost in the Indies. He appears in the middle of a desert, spits at a Capuchin missionary. He whispers in his ear to get away of this continent for once and for all. Short after he regrets and kindly embracing him he reveals he needs him. He shall never leave. We took the boat. It was full. There were many people wanting to leave Europe. Rivet came with us on the same boat to New York. Then we took a boat New York-Barranquilla. Do you know Tucano songs? Yes I do, Doctor. I know one chant when they go to the bushes, a hunt song. Can you sing us one of those songs? That song is very nice. Can you tell me the meaning in Spanish? Doctor, the literal translation would be more or less the following: "Fishermen, come on, let's go to the river to fish." We stop pressing the button and it is still recording. This is the best gift that Gregorio has bought for his own use. Hernández returns from war as social scientist. He returns to carry out a mission. How do you say "Winter"? "Summer"? "Day"? The main purpose of the expeditions was everything that had to do with patriotic symbols, the national anthem and the flag. - How do you call this? - Yellow. - How? - Yellow, yellow. - Blue. - Blue. - Red. - Red. Yellow, blue, red. Colombia's flag. Today is our independence day. Hello, nice meeting you. Pero López, Spanish Conqueror. How's it going? All fine. See you later. They live according to nature. They do not have any possessions, all the goods are of common property. They live together without a king, without any authority. I have met a hunter. A footprint. It's dry, it must have several days. I can see a rabbit in the distance. I take out my rifle and without mercy, without the least remorse, a shot. Pum. They have trained us to be sorry for everything. Even I must give them pity. Luckily Mr. Hunter, you were right. Music sounding. I stop hearing, I stop thinking. This is the story of a rabbit. "Of Cannibals' Montaigne's essay." The cannibals found it very strange that so many bearded men, tall, strong and well-armed, should submit to the obedience of a king. How come these strong men did not choose one of them to command the group? How come some have luck and comforts while some others are hungry and full of misery? How can these beggars endure so much injustice and not strangle the kings? Why don't they burn their houses? The cannibal thinks. Motilon Indian in the city of Bogotá. Who created the world? According to the teachings of the Javerian fathers the world was made by God. OK, but according to the natives? According to our catechism, we believe it was the God of the day. How is he called in native language? Estecovich. Do you have a God that looks like the devil of the Catholics? Yes Doctor, we have one. How is he called? Itsuriboraro. And what does he do? He is the devil we have against us. He takes away everything. Bringing us diseases and plagues. In Tierradentro he wrote with a Petromax lamp his field diaries and the letters he sent. His third and last trip. The return to Tierradentro. How do you say "Pain"? Drunkenness? How do you say "We want to learn many things"? The second expedition to Tierradentro in 1942, was from the national government. Focused on the knowledge of the habits of the Paeces. Spending a lot of time to the physical part, measuring the skulls of the natives, determining their blood group, and asking them what stories and scares they had. That information was sent to France, to the Musée de l'Homme, and to the Smithsonian Institution. 300 blood tests were taken in Tierradentro. A great scientific contribution from Doctor Hernández. How do you say "Two white men arrived from Bogotá"? How do you say "What do they want to do here"? How do you say "Maybe those whites are good"? How do you say "The Indians want to work the land better"? How do you say "The Indians also have rights"? The land belongs to the indigenous people. "Dawn", "1 Year", "2 Years"? Yellow, blue and red is the flag of Colombia. Today is July 20th. How do you say "Indians are Colombians"? He was about to lose the notion of reality in Tierradentro. To get lost in that world and never return. Belong to nowhere. Pero López's account of a battle in Tierradentro. The Paeces Indians use that type of hat. Whilst running away from horses one of them thought that a rider had lost his hat. That rider is Pero López. They will shoot at me and steal my horse at any moment. They are hiding nearby looking at me. When he heard laments, Pero López got off his horse. It was the indigenous Piogoanza agonizing, he was being torn apart by one of the murderers dogs of the troop. A second before getting off his horse, calmness flooded and mountains went silent. Pieces of bodies around him. Pieces of men around him. We are killers, says Pero López. The sound of dismembered birds. Slitting their throats. They threw their heads over the road. Birds eating their eyes. These Indians are like dogs Bomb dropped in the house of Gregorio Hernández de Alba Hernández field diary on an attack. At dawn of the 12th, this month. More exactly at 3.15 AM. A bomb was dropped at the entrance of the house. Located on the 3rd street number 4-29 of this city. The land belongs to the Indians. Hernández blamed some landowners for the "The Birds" massacre of some Paeces indigenous. Paramilitaries serving the conservative party. How do you say "birds"? "The Birds" slaughtered a group of natives with barbed wire. They left their heads over the road. Bird. The missionaries protected the landowners who abused and persecuted the indigenous. Confronting them brought Dad enmities. During his last years, he considered he didn't belong to the church anymore. The day your father died what did you think? What can you remember? I remember when we arrived to San Agustín, the lying statues. I was amazed. I will never forget that. We got into the river and could see those statues. I really don't have clear memories about that moment, I was a kid. It was then that I realized it was all part of a game. Carlos told me things he really didn't remember. The same way his father did. Fables. Monsters, snakes. Overlapped memories. Although I got lost in those fables, he always told me something that made me enter in that game again. Dad stories were exciting. Where Carlos also decided to forget some things. I believe he finally told me everything I should know about his father. As years passed through, dad's figure started disappearing. Yesterday died the anthropologist Gregorio Hernández de Alba. The death ceremony or bury. - I'm Pero López. - Yes, Sir. I am a Spanish conqueror and I came to these lands through the Magdalena river crossing to Popayán. I came to tell you what I saw. Yes, Sir. The natives of this land are dirty and poor. They eat human flesh, they are warlike mountain people. They fight with heavy spears of thirty meters or longer. In spite of this they have great advantage over us in dexterity. Many live in very harsh mountains, eat human flesh and sin in the nefarious. We found plenty of sausages in their houses, some were in the fire. Some local experts warned me that they were human flesh sausages. In many places we found the figure of the devil as a trophy. They worshipped it as we do with God. The war against the barbarians, has as its purpose the fulfillment of the natural law. For the great good of the defeated. They should learn from the Christians the humanity so that they may become used to virtue. With a sound doctrine and pious teachings prepare their souls to gladly receive the Christian religion. As this cannot be done if not after being submitted to our empire, the Barbarians must obey the Spaniards. If they reject them they can be compelled to justice and probity. Please, tell me Don Alberto, what do you think about the Spaniards? Thank you very much for coming to visit the indigenous. Do you agree of us being here? Yes, Sir. Thank you very much. It's time to claim. Yes, Sir. But tell me something Don Alberto, tell me we are crap, we are murderers. What? The reasonable would be that you detest us. Yes, Sir. - Tell me something. - Yes, Sir. If I tell you that I came for gold and for women. Yes, Sir. Don Alberto, the Spaniards are bad people. This man came to plunder. He came for gold and women, and leaves children everywhere. This is a bad guy. He represents the worst of the Spanish conquest. What would you say to a man like that? He doesn't understand. Maybe if we repeat it again, it will be meaningful for him. They eat human flesh, they are sinners. Tell Don Alberto who you are, what did you see in these lands? I am Pero López and in this land I found wild people. The truly wild. On a glorious day, black bearded white skinned men arrived on three curious ships to the unknown lands that would form America's continent. These people will always be reigned by natural law following more cultured and human imperial and nation's rules. There are some who are destined to be masters and others slaves. It's the natural law. We bring them culture, civilization, language, good manners. We arrived with rifles, cannons, swords, whips. Everything necessary in case they do not accept to submit to our heavy burden. We do not like our sacrifice to be ignored. Or even worse, received with disdain and hatred. A true savage. A child raised by the wolves. A wolf child. Begin with the Doctrine. These Indians are like dogs. A dog is a tamed wolf. Begin with the Doctrine. Begin with the Doctrine. Calmness flooded and the mountain went silent. So many misfortunes in this land. I still don't get why people don't cry just by stepping on it. Paradise at last, salvation! People screamed from the boats. Scum! I know now that this new world is an unwanted place. You can't even imagine what it is to disembark in a swamp. Go through the woods and feel surrounded by the wild. The most complete and absolute wilderness. To live in the middle of the incomprehensible, that is detestable. The fascination for the abominable. This copy that I am writing I will leave it to my descendants as a testimony of the small deeds of their grandfather. The ideas of a miserable soldier lost in these lands. I am Pero López, a Spanish conqueror who passed through these lands around 1540. I want to tell you part of what I saw. Me?
