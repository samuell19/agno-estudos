Hey, Jenny. You know, Peter, you have a quality, a quality very similar to Montgomery clift. Especially sometimes when you're sad. - Yeah. - I love you. Maybe around the eyes a little. I've loved you since the first moment I saw you. I guess maybe I even loved you before I saw you. You were the fella that wondered why I followed you here. It was so thoughtful of you to take me all the way out here. Yeah, well, I know you love revivals. I love you too. It scares me. Oh, she's so beautiful. But it is a wonderful feeling. - You're beautiful, Jenny. - Hold you, I can see you... - Look at the way she looks at him. - Next to me. But what's it gonna be like next week? All summer long, I'll still be as much in love with you. - You'll be gone. - But I'll be at the lake. You'll come up and see me. I'll bet anything Montgomery clift was an aquarius. I know my parents... You must love her very deeply. It's so nice here with the rain. Feels so private. Hey, well what's going on here? Are you taking my picture? Shh! I'm filming that lady with the bag. Ah, ohh. Gee, I hope I didn't spoil your shot. No, it's all right... listen, why don't you put your coke bottle in the basket over there, and pretend you don't see me. - Oh! - What do you mean, just... just put it right in the basket? Yeah, yeah, but don't look at me, just... just act natural. Okay. Rubble, that's the whole problem, they let them bring their beer cans! Bunch of drunken fools! Thank you - ha-ha-ha. Well I'm nothing, I-I'm not. If you think it's easy for an old lady to make a living in this town, you're crazy. Yeah, the old ladies, they're the ones who get it in the end. All they drink is cans. All they do is make cans. No more pop bottles. Cans! - What's the matter? - Ha-ha. - What are you looking at? - Nothing, really. - Eh-heh... - A mother. Holy mother of god, that mother. - Oh help me, please! - Oh no... - Somebody help me, he's gonna jump on me! - No, he's... he's just going to make a movie. Oh come on, lady, I'm only trying to make a film! I heard that. I heard that! Policeman. - Policeman! - Oh Christ. I got about four dollars worth of bottles in this bag, and you're waiting to jump on me from off that roof like an animal! - No, there's... there's nothing to worry about. - Policeman! - He's one of those filmmakers. - He's got a gun up there. - Oh no, that's a camera. - On that roof. - No, that's a camera, see? - Oh no, miss, he's a mugger. - No, he, he... - Oh he's trying to jump down and steal all my bottles! Policeman! Policeman! There's a mugger on the roof! Police! Oh, we never get a cop. Oh, murderers, rapists, knifers! Beer-drunks! All of you drug-addicts! Sure, don't arrest them... Open the jail doors! An old lady can't walk alone in the street. Filthy jungle. - Muggers... - Did you get it okay? Uh, yeah, that was fine, thank you. - Listen, I'm uh... - Police! I'm coming down now, could you help me with the camera? - What am I paying my taxes for? - Sure. And where is a policeman when an old lady needs one now? Hey, you better be careful. I am waiting... - Just... just put this on the bench there. - For someone... Okay. Who gonna love me... Look, this is... this is a very expensive camera, - so be careful, all right? - Okay. - Wait, you have it? - Yeah. All right, thank you. Waiting... Oh, be careful. For someone... Who gonna need me... - And love me... - Thank you. - Oh, you got that. - Sorry. Yeah, it's all right. - And take care of me. - That's very nice of you. - Oh, it was nothing. - No, really, that was very cool. - It was fun. - Hold me... - It wasn't too heavy, was it? - Oh no, not at all. - So I won't be lonely. - I'd hate to have your husband come after me with an axe. - Ha-ha-ha-ha, no. - Waiting... Waiting, can't you see why... Do you find it interesting doing what you do? Love you? Yeah, it's very challenging. Oh, I'm sure it must be. Yeah, it is. Da dada da... - I work in a memorabilia shop. - Da dada... - You know we have all kinds of movie things. - Da dadum da da... - In fact, my boss was a silent movie star. - Da da dada da... - Maybe you've heard of her, sil blanchette? - Dada dadum... - Dadada da dadada... - No? I thought maybe because you're in the movie business. Waiting, waiting... - Which way are you going? - Can't you see... - Oh, anywhere, I was just... - Why... - You know, walking around. - I... - Oh, okay, great. - Love you? My husband always regards film as a great talent too. Oh it's great. Godard says, "film is truth at 24 frames a second." - Yeah. - Man is a genius. I know. My husband was a filmmaker till the day he died. What? I said my husband was a filmmaker. He died making a movie. - I'm sorry, that's awful. - Yeah. Well, he was in england making this film on high buildings in england. And he went up there, you know, right up there. He fell off a girder, and he got killed. Thirty-five floors. - Poor kid. - You know what? - What? - When they found him, he was still holding his camera after 35 floors. Imagine. As a matter of fact, doctor, I just got another letter from my husband this morning. Just this morning, before I went to work. Mhm, breathe in. - Ahh. - Deep breath. War's a hell of a thing... And breathe out. - Ohh. - They should end all damn wars. Sherman said that in the civil war. He said, "war is hell." - Ouch. - Sorry. - It's okay. - Pressed a little too hard. Yeah. Yes, we... We love each other very much he's never out of my thoughts. Del, Mr. braddock has brought up a point here that maybe we should get started. Oh, we've been rolling all along... I know, but it is getting late, and we have a dinner line to launch. You can see the way they're lying. It's very specific. It's position one for the vita-mites, position two for the bowl. It's backwards! You moved the bowl in place, sweetheart, what am I supposed to do? - Yes. - Where you going with that? - Del, del. - But we have these very big lights that we... - You understand. - I do, I do... - Working point. - We have a problem here that's... Marty... Marty! Herby is here. - Herby? - Herby, the guy that got out of the draft. - Where? - He's over there. - What, the raisin? - No, the vita-mite by the bowl. - The one with the bite out of the corner? - Yeah, that's herby. Was he 1-a? Yeah, I think so, but he got reclassified. - Check on him, will you? - Oh, come on talk to him. I'll talk to him, sure, I have 30 days to appeal. All right. Visual. Del, I'm bothered about the box's color. The color seems wrong. It's a little too brown. - That's it, that's what it is. - It's a little too brown. Mhm. Well I think when the... When the right light is on, I think you'll see it's the right shade of brown. - I see. - I hope so, del, because Mr. braddock - is rightly concerned. - Oh, sure, sure. Look uh, Dave, hit the DC-1! You see? Del. Yes well that's good. Del! - That's smart. - Oh I think it's... - I think it'll be fine. - Del! - Beginning. - Thank you. Mr. granite, would you like to meet a raisin, or a... - Keep that key light below. - No thanks, no thanks, I would just like to see the show. Del, this is herby, herby, del. - Hi, hello, herby. - Yeabh, it's really rough, the reclassification, and that... that's bad, you know. The thing is, man, that I was in sort of the same predicament, except that I was married, and my old lady was going to have a baby, so I told the draft board, and they reclassified me 3-a, something about being a father. I was reclassified 3-a, 'cause I was gonna be father. Anyhow, when Kay told me, I thought that I'd pass along to you, might give you some idea. Yeah, thank you, herby. That's, um... That's... that's really... thank you. Listen, if you hear of anything, acting, or films, give me a call, huh? Herby gatz, g-a-t-z, gatz. - Kay knows the number. - Yeah, good... listen, thank you very much. You know, that's what people are for, you know, do favors, pass on information. Thank you, herby. - I've got 30 days. - Yo, del, the director's ready for the raisins and the vita-mites. Talk about it later tonight. All right. All right, all the raisins and vita-mites in the... in the bowl. Why am I rejected? Because I'm not robust. Only the plumpest of sun-ripened raisins... - Okay, I'd like to get one run-through! - Are good enough for vita-mite. Why am I rejected? When exactly are you having your baby, Jenny? Well, if everything goes according to schedule, in about three months. - Isn't that something? - Oh yeah. Cheese. A very zen thing. Yeah, I like it. Especially now with the baby coming. Just can't stand the taste of coffee anymore. Have you ever heard of Charles tuttle? Is he... does he make movies? No, he's a... he was a publisher. Oh. And uh, he became very interested in things oriental, and he started publishing books that were translations from the Japanese, and he has a beautiful book on tea. You have very penetrating eyes. It's... it's a lovely book, I'd like to give you a copy. Oh, that would be nice. - Oh, I'm sorry. - Oh, oh, that's okay. - I'm always doing clumsy things. - No, that's all right, let me just get this... No, I'll get something, you shouldn't be jumping up and down. How tall are you? About 6' 2". That's funny, you look even taller when you stand up. You know, you don't have to worry about it, tea doesn't stain. Or is it coffee? - Can I help you? - No, no, it's all right, I'm... I'm uh... I'm getting you the book. Here it is. Oh. Oh, it's a beautiful little book. Mm. So delicate. What kind of paper is that? It's rice paper. It's made out of rice. Rice? Yeah. The Japanese eat a lot of rice. The Indians too... Indians eat a lot of rice. Yeah, but so do the Chinese. A lot of people do... A lot of people eat rice instead of bread. Ha-ha-ha. Can you imagine making paper out of bread? It'd be like writing on a sandwich. - Ha-ha-ha-ha. - Ha-ha. You're a very sympathetic person, Jenny. I get very good vibrations from you. What's your sign? - What's my what? - Ha, your sign. You know, your astrological sign. Oh, oh, yes, yes. I was born August 15th. That's Leo. Mhm. - Ha-ha-ha-ha. - Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha. Ha-ha, ha-ohh. You know that this is the first, honest to god, movie studio I've ever been in. Didn't he ever take you to his studio? Who? Your husband. It was stupid of me to remind you of that, I'm sorry. Oh no, that's... that's okay. You know, I... I can't seem to get that image out of my head what image? Falling 35 floors and still holding on to the camera. Simply meant, that's true. Excuse me, please, I'm sorry. You can take my seat here. I'm getting off in a couple stops. Eh, excuse me, please. I'm sorry, excuse me. You know, you have a very pretty wife. In her condition, you should take buses. You all right? Yeah. Jenny, I just don't see why you had to lie to me. People expect you to be married. Not necessarily. Being pregnant has nothing to do with being married. Being married isn't important. There's... there's plenty of rotten marriages. Did you ever see anything can happen? But with Aldo ray and Judy holliday? Boy, talk about rotten marriages. Yeah, well, you don't even have to look that far. I just didn't want you to think that I was... Fast. Jenny, I... I think you might have protected yourself, but... It never even occurred to me that you were fast. Look, it's none of my business, but... Why didn't you protect yourself? Why would... didn't you take some pills? I come from this very small town in Connecticut. I mean it's really a small town. Windsor locks. I don't know if you've ever heard of it. It's about 15 miles north of Hartford. No, I don't, uh... Well, anyway... It's really a very small town, I mean everybody knows everybody else in windsor locks. My doctor... The doctor's... Dr. lumbert, he's the doctor that brought me into the world. I mean, I was born at home in bed, in my parents' bed. It's like a 150-year-old bed. It's really terrific, you'd love it. Anyway, I've got to go to Dr. lumbert and... Ask him to prescribe birth control pills. I mean what would he think? What would he think now? I really want my baby, delano. I'm looking forward to being a mother. What do you think of the kabuki? Yeah, it's lovely. It's taken from a real live kabuki performance. It was very thoughtful of you to do that. Look, could you turn it off? I have... I have kind of a problem. Oh, sure. Oh my god, I forgot to ask, do you want lemon or milk? No, no, no, this is fine, this is... this is just fine. It's... perfect. Oh, I'm sorry, I think I let the water boil too long. No, no, it's okay. Oh, it's... it's... Do you mind if I sit on the floor? Oh no, 'course not. As I said, I... I... I have this problem, and I just... I just think that this is something that we can share. See, what it is... Is that I'm... I'm being inducted into the army... And I don't wanna go. What a terrible thing to happen. I just... I don't see why my personal freedom should be taken away from me, just... I mean, for something I don't even believe in. Well, did you tell 'em that? Who? Tell who? I don't know, to who... Whoever it is that speaks on behalf of the army. No, you see, they're... They're only exempting married men with children. Or, at least, married men with children on the way. Oh. Plus... I think we've got to know each other... Pretty well. So without any... You know, without any sentimentality, or... or... or... or any... Well, I mean, just... Jenny, will you marry me? God, uh... What I feel for you... 1 think could... Could easily develop into a very real love. Yeah, uh... I think that it could really be something very good for both of us. You... you know? - Yes, I think so. - You know? I-I mean, if we're honest with each other. Oh, we will be. I mean... I mean, I would take care of you, you know? I would... 1 would... I would... I would... I would pay the bills. Uh, I'd... All the medical expenses, and all that. You know? I'd buy all the food and the clothing. I... 1 know this is... This isn't a physical... Thing here, I'm sure you have your own friends, and, uh, there's a... there's a girl that I've been seeing, and, uh... mean... I'd respect your privacy too. I'm... well, if you wanted to, we could have... We... we could have separate bedrooms, if you wanted, you know. I would give the baby... I mean, the baby, you know, would have my name. And I just... I think that it... It would be a way of solving both... both our... You know, our... Our problems. Well, the... I'll have to think about. Yeah, look, it's... It's a very serious... Thing... don't... don't... don't... We'd have to call my parents. I mean, they'd probably want to meet you. All right, so I'll meet them. Okay. I'll marry you. Yes, I'll marry you. It's... I'm... That's... terrific. - I'm very happy. - Soam II. We oughtta or something, - you know what I mean? - Yeah. Go... buy something. - What? - We'll get a pizza. - Ha-ha-ha. - I don't know, you wanna... That's nice, thank you. You're welcome. Ha-ha - ha-ha-ha. By a waterfall I'm calling you. You-ho-ho-ho. We can share it all - beneath a ceiling of blue. - You know, I was thinking we can make that little room we have all your equipment, we can make it into a nice little room for the baby. - We could even put a little crib in there. - Heavenly day. Oh, and I was thinking too, - the hall closet, - Here where... We can use it half for your things and half for mine. We can do the same thing with the medicine cabinet. - There's a wipper will... - Del. - That's calling you. - Del. - Just got this really beautiful idea. - By a waterfall... With Jenny moving out of her place, you know, - ...He's dreaming too. And with all the hassle I've got going for me at my place with the guy with his binoculars, and the FBI janitor checking out the garbage for grass, well I'd love to know if her place isn't too bad. I might just take it home. - You know? - Mm. With you. You're what? I'm gonna be married. She's gonna get married. I heard, I'm on the other phone. Jenny, that's wonderful. Who, dear? You're going to get married to who? Do we know him, dear? - Is he nice? - Of course, he's nice. So... You're getting married. Yes, it's... It's to the father. The baby's father. He's come home, it's... It's absolutely unexpected, he's... From Vietnam, he's... He's come home. They let him come home? - Yeah. - He's all right, isn't he, Jenny? He didn't go crazy, or anything like that? Oh no. He, uh, he got wounded... In the shoulder. Uh, so... so they gave him a medical discharge. He's crippled... She's gonna marry a cripple. Oh no, he's... He just got wounded a little bit. He's perfectly all right. Jenny, nobody gets wounded just a little. Remember that whatever we may have said in the past, we are your parents, and we love you. Goodbye, sweetheart. Goodbye. Bye. How'd it go? Okay, I told them. Can't hear the music though. Oh, I really must be drunk. Oh. What's the matter? Ha-ha, I think the baby's drunk. I felt it move and it moved like it was drunk. Poor thing. Could a baby inside get drunk? I don't know. Could I touch it, Jenny? Sure. Give me your hand. Can you feel? - Yeah, I can feel it. - No, wait. - Oh yeah. - There he is, there. It's beautiful. Del, you can actually feel it. You know, I almost had a baby once. You were gonna have a baby? But, I got rid of it. Oh, Kay, I'm sorry. You know... You know, I really admire you for going through with it. At the beginning, I guess I just thought it'd go away. Ohh. I know... I know it's none of my business, but... How did you get clocked? I don't know. I guess I never really had the nerve to take the pill. Nerve? Yeah. I mean you get up every morning, and... you take a pill. Suppose you took a pill every morning, and... Nobody asked me. You... you're beautiful. - Ha-ha-ha. - Ha-ha. Beautiful, but big. - Ha-ha-ha-ha. - Ha-ha-ha. We're really getting married, for god's sake. You know, Jenny, I really like you... C.andifl can... Be of any help, you know, anyhow... I just wanna be your friend. Okay? You know... I think this is a completely unique situation. What we have going here. I-I know that you don't necessarily love me, I mean, it's part of our agreement, and I'm... I'm perfectly content with the arrangement as it now stands, so I don't want you to get me wrong... But there is something I'd like to know. That baby, you know, the one that Kay got rid of? Was it yours? That was before I met her. Way before. I'm glad. I think you're really gonna like my father. He's kind of eccentric. Well no, not really, he's... He's a perfectionist. That's more what he is. He makes teeth. He does what? He makes teeth. You know, Bridges, caps, molars. It's kind of an art that's dying out. Your father makes teeth? Mhm. He's very good at it. He's about the best tooth maker in new england. One minute! Hi, daddy. - Jenny. - Oh, daddy. - Oh, daddy. - Jenny, oh. - How you feeling? - I'm fine. Really, I'm just fine. Oh, mom. - Oh, mom. - Oh, Jenny, Jenny. - Oh. - How do you feel? - I'm fine, really. - I'm... I'm so sorry. Uh, come in. Come in. Are you? - Oh, mom. - Oh, honey, I can't help it. I put your bags in the guest room. Yes, fine, thank you. He's away now. - Yes. - In the Navy. And, oh, there are clean sheets on your bed, and your own towel. And if you need a... Extra blanket, or even another pillow, don't be afraid to just shout right out. - Thank you. - Ha-ha-ha. Speak right up. Everybody in this house does. How is it out there? What, sir? I mean is it really as rough as they say it is. It's, um... It's so-s0. Well, you know, you never know from reading the papers. Mhm. Derf joined at the naval reserve, while he was still in high school. Derf, our boy der, he's in the pacific now, you know. Yes, yes. That's derf. We've given you his room. - He's in the pacific now. - Yes. Oh, look how thin her face has gotten, Charles. Remember how I got when I was carrying Jenny? - Mhm. - Like a balloon. - Ha-ha. - Mm, blown right out. - Ha-ha-ha. - Ha-ha-ha-ha. Should've seen it, ha-ha-ha-ha. Delano. Is that an Italian name? No, no, no, that's... As a matter of fact, I was named after Franklin delano Roosevelt. - Oh. - Oh, for heaven sakes. - My goodness. - Ha-ha. I was for willkie. Been a republican all of my life. Roosevelt got us into the war. If it wasn't for Roosevelt, Germany and the allies would have marched right through red Russia. Fight communism once and for all. - Mr. marsh loves his politics. - Ha-ha. I am, but... You wouldn't be fighting out there in Vietnam. Yes. And derf would be home now. Excuse me. Jenny. - Are you comfortable? - I'm fine, daddy. - Do you want a pillow or something? - No. Jenny tells me you make teeth. Hm? I've always been interested in teeth. Really? Well then, let me show you something. Come with me... ah, but, take it easy. Oh yes, yes, that's... that's amazing. Yeah that's... A very impressive display. This one from the early vocal act. That's, what, an early... an early form of material used? Mhm. Just imagine, look at all those different styles. Every different kind. I'm a what you might call a kind of... - Collector. - Yeah, well, I would say so, that's... This one here I'm really proud of, - this upper and lower set. - Mm. - Hand-carved ivory. - Really... hand-carved? - Really? - Yes. - Mm. - Mrs. marsh and I picked it up in New York. - Mm. - A junk shop. A junk shop? Isn't that amazing? And they... they never knew what they had. - Not whatsoever. - That's... - Just lying there. - You never know what you're gonna find. This one here, the small one. The little one. - Jenny's first tooth. - Oh, really? - Ha-ha. - Ha-ha-ha-ha. - That's a nice mementomomento. - Oh yes. - Yeah. - Very dear to me. Oh, oh, I'm sure it is, I'm sure. - I have my lab down in the basement. - Oh, yes? After dinner, you and I... - We'll go down. - Oh, thank you, that would be very nice. That would... I'd certainly, um... - I'd... I'd... I'd... - I have teeth going back over 100 years. - Charles. - Well that's certainly a historical, uh, - collection. - Charles! Yes. - Excuse me. - Yes. - Enjoy yourself. - Thank you, yes. - Welcome home, soldier boy, - Welcome home, soldier boy, - welcome home, soldier boy. - Welcome home, soldier boy. - Welcome home, dear delano. - Welcome home, dear delano. - Welcome home, soldier boy. - Welcome home, soldier boy. I guess this is one bride'll have to walk over the threshold I guess you'll want to unpack. Oh, I can do it tomorrow. I think I'll, uh, do some editing I started yesterday. I think I'll unpack. How does "Mrs. Castle" sound to you? It sounds like my mother. Ha-ha-ha. When am I gonna meet them? Who? Your parents. Del? I haven't told them yet. Oh. Why? I thought I'd wait. It... it might be easier before the baby. Blah. I mean then it'd just be, you know, two surprises at once. I'll just be a minute. That's beautiful. That's beautiful. Here I am. Oh, Jenny, you look nice! What's that funny smell? I'm smoking. Oh. You look really nice, Jenny. Sit down. Boy, that must be some strong cigarette. It's grass! Oh, yeah, grass. - Here, it's great stuff, try some. - Oh, no, thanks. Oh, it's terrific, really, try some. No, really, I don't think I should. It's beautiful, I'm telling you, take some. I really don't think I should. You know, the baby. Oh, yeah, okay. All right, suit yourself. But I really don't mind if you do. I mean, I know that... That a lot of very creative people smoke marijuana. Okay. All right, that's enough. That's enough. So... This is the beginning. Yup. Do you get up early? Yeah. I bet you're a day person. Yeah. I know that... some men find the pregnant shape offensive. Well, not me. It doesn't bother me at all. Isn't it fantastic? Of course, I don't know what you looked like before. I don't suppose you... Had occasion to see a... A pregnant girl undress before. Jenny, what's the matter? Hey! Hey, Jenny, I'm happy! Hey! Woo, Jenny! So what's it gonna be? Natural or regular? Get down from there! Get down this instant! So what's it gonna be? Oh, I'm sorry, my mind must have been someplace else. I'm gonna give that kid such a slap. When I tell you something, Dillon, I mean it! Now you get the hell down from there, you hear me? Next one's gonna be natural 'cause it's really the most satisfying way. Really is. And your husband gets to feel a part of it, you know? What's your name? Mrs. castle. Delano castle. No, your name, your first name, so I can talk to you. Oh, it's Jenny. So, Jenny, it's your first? Yes. What does your husband do? He's a filmmaker. Great! Then he can film the whole thing! A friend of mine, her husband's also a filmmaker. He did that! It makes a really nice gift for the kid. Yeah, I guess so. She guesses so. What's more beautiful than seeing yourself being born? Del? - Del? - Huh? I've been trying not to disturb you, but there's something I wanted to talk to you about. What? Well, I met a woman today in the park. Yeah? - I'm sorry. - Well, Jenny, I'm doing something that's kinda tricky here. Yeah, I'm sorry. What is it? What? What did you want? Oh, no, it's nothing. No, it's all right. What... what... what was it? Well, I... 1 met this woman today in the park. - Yeah. - You know, one of those mothers' parks, and we got to talking, and she asked my husband... what you did, and... and I said you were a filmmaker, and she said she had a friend who was a filmmaker, and that he filmed his wife giving birth. So? So... If you're interested, I wouldn't mind. What? In... in filming me giving birth. I... 1 thought a lot about it, and... I'd give my consent. I don't make that kind of film. I... I just... I thought you might be interested, that's all. Look, Jenny, I had a whole sequence all laid out in my head, and now I don't have any idea where I was. - I'm sorry. - No, don't be sorry. - Just let me be alone sometimes. - I know, okay, I'm sorry. You know, one thing has happened since we got married. I'm really eating a lot better. You're a terrific cook. You know, we could call the baby Jean-Luc, after Jean-Luc godard. Jean-Luc works if it's a girl or a boy. How'd you get the potatoes so crispy? By baking them, in the oven. All the goodness goes down into the meat. Oh, it's just great. Do you think it's pretentious calling a baby Jean-Luc? Would you like to name the baby after somebody in your family? I haven't given it much though. We can talk about it sometime. I really would like to talk about the baby's name, del. What are you worried about? Plenty of time. Oh, boy, that was really good. You're a terrific cook. Listen, I'm gonna do some work at the studio, so don't wait up for me. I don't know what time I'll be back. I think I'll just probably go to a movie. Okay. Goodnight. Del? I think I'll just stay home. Oh, you know, this damn door won't stay shut. You have to hold it with your foot. This place is so small. I don't know how Jenny could stand it. Hello? Oh, hi, mom. No, no, you didn't. No, really. I was... Del and I were just... Sitting here watching television. Oh, I'm sorry you can't sleep. Oh. There's no reason to worry. I know, but there really isn't. I'm fine. Del's fine. Del says to send you his love. My mother says the same to you. Mom, you know what? Del wanted to film me giving birth to the... to the baby. Of course I said no! But imagine. Entering the home. She crawls through the window, he just rips the front door off the hinges and walks right in! She says, "that's nothing! You ought to see us come through the roof!" Married seven years, Larry and Linda stover! She told us that her husband was quite the handyman around the home. As a matter of fact, he walks under a black cloud of doom. Anything he touches breaks, falls apart, or disappears. She says he once brought home artificial flowers. The next day, they all died. Married 17 years, Brad and Gloria melks! And they're all here to play the anniversary game! And here to help our couples celebrate their years of marriage is your host and master of anniversaries, al hamel! Thank you all very much and welcome to the anniversary game where we try to find out if a couple gets to know each other better the longer they've been married. You've met our three couples... You're not keeping your part of the agreement! Each wife to predict what her husband will do and then vice versa. We never discussed anything about television! Please close the doors so we can't see nor hear what's happening out here. I should've kept my job. Ms. Blanchard might've been a little strange, but at least she talked all the time. "Please visit me, I'm in the bedroom. Your wife, Jenny." Please take a look over here. We have, over here, as soon as we get the curtain to move, three things which I'm sure you're gonna be terribly interested in... Do you have to play that damn thing every morning? Yes, I do, I like to hear a little noise when I wake up! We have three eggs over there, my dear... Look, Jenny, if this marriage is going to work, we... We have to stick to the agreement. If you'd just look at me sometimes. $10 for each egg that he cracks... Jenny, look, I... I feel a growing affection for you. - No, not on me! - On his forehead! But I feel certain loyalties too. Not on you, but it's okay on the husband, right? - Oh, yeah, it's all right. - Terrific. To people I knew before we met. It's just that I feel we're drifting apart! Oh, Jenny, come on, that's not where it's at. Well, then, why do you always have to have people here? You're perfectly entitled to have your friends over any time you want. You're my friend! I haven't got a Kay. What the hell does she have to do with it? For Christ's sake, Jenny, Kay's been very nice about this, a hell of a lot more understanding than you're showing. Because she's your friend and I'm not. You like her. I can't just change my life like that! Pie in the face? She's your friend too! But something almost as good as a pie in the face. - It's not the same! - Oh, come on, Jenny, come on! Goddamn it, cut it out! I noticed... Look, Jenny, we agreed to be married. Now don't try to turn it into something else. Shit! Now what the hell is that doing there? I'm falling all over the furniture, Jenny, I don't know where it goes anymore. Del. Del, do you want a divorce? Because as much as I want this marriage to work, I just can't be turned into one of those ladies who nags and... Makes everything difficult all the time. I want it to work, del. I agree with the whole idea of buying black. Sure is wonderful, though, the way it worked out. I mean, the way everything just timed out so perfectly. Ol 1! Do we have any chocolate cake or anything? Oh, Jenny, you're getting so fat. They shouldnf, black should buy black. Well, what if... Does anybody got any salami or any cold meat? I really like coming over here. Everything is so relaxed. Jenny. Jenny, are you all right? I mean, have you seen a doctor? - Yeah, I'm fine. - Okay. Do we have any of those chocolate marshmallow things or anything? - Based on your white standard. - Of course, but is the standard valid? If the drain is and the channel flow through, which it's funneled, yes. - Yes, yes. - Yes, yes. She touches you straight through your skin places the funnel. No, your white man. She always knows just where to begin can I tell you something? She reaches out, then she settles in I happen to have a black Dahlia... She's the queen she's the queen she's the queen of feeling No, no. Based... based on your... Based on your white standard. You're talking about through the black funnel into a white drain. - But you're not following. - I'm following you. The point which you yourself made about the socioeconomic balance here. I'm telling you... Hiding behind the web that you wear she picks a place and then she settles there she always takes the largest share del? She's the queen she's the queen she's the queen of feeling Excuse me, do you mind if I sit down here? Uh, are you waiting... Waiting for someone? A friend or someone? Because if... if the seat's free, I wouldn't mind sitting here. I just walked all the way from the empire hotel. Yeah, it's quite a hike. Broadway and 63rd street. Yeah, a nice, brisk walk. Did you know that walking is the best exercise in the world? Yeah. You're a very pretty young lady. A very pretty young lady. Very pretty. Oh, now, listen, if I should get out of line, you just say, "Fred, you're stepping out of line." You know what you do that I like? You listen. Oh, I should introduce myself. My name is Frederick Callahan. They couldn't get it all on the card, so they just wrote "Fred." - Oh. - What'll it be, folks? Uh, I'd like a rye and ginger, a large rye and ginger, and... - Gin gimlet. - Double? - Okay. - All right. Yeah. What's your name? Jenny. Jenny. Oh, that's a nice name. Warm name. Very nice. I'm from Cleveland. I'm here on a barbers' convention, international, all over the world. Yeah. Jenny, could I ask you a favor? I mean, I... I don't know anybody in this town. Oh, a couple of barbers, but, uh, I thought maybe we could... Wouldn't be any hanky-panky, Jenny, it's just that... Well, I like you and I like talking to you, and I thought maybe we could go and take a little walk and... Get a bite to eat. It'd be a real treat for me, Jenny. - Oh. - Okay. - Lady. - Thank you. - Thank you. - All right. Drink up. It's paid for. I'd regard it as a real favor, Jenny. What do you say? It's 5 o'clock in the morning. Oh, hi, Jen. I'm sorry I dropped it. Oh, yeah, I must've fallen asleep. Hey, did you... did you have a good time? Yeah. Oh, I just must've blanked right out. Was it a nice party? Mmm, you know, same kinda thing. Oh, wow, I just conked right out. That's okay, I can clean it. Hey, this place is a mess. Do you know I called every goddamn police station in the city? Where the hell have you been? Well... Goodnight, everybody. Take care. I didn't do anything wrong, del. And I'm your wife. Yes. Having a baby. Yes. We'll go for walks. Everywhere. I want you very much. I want you too. Del? What? I wanted it to be. It will be, you'll see. - Did you feel it? - Yeah. Feels like a little girl. You can't tell. You're too feminine to have a boy. Doesn't go by that. What was he like? Who? The father. I knew him from school. Were you going out? Yes. Why did he leave you? He doesn't know what happened. You didn't tell him? I came to New York and I already got engaged. You should have the soup before it gets cold. Didn't work, Jenny. Marriage didn't work. They wouldn't buy it. It's cream of shrimp. You shouldn't carry heavy things like that. L, uh, I bought an antique, uh, baby carriage today. Kay helped me. Did you give them all the facts? You can't talk to those people. I might have to go away, Jenny. I just might have to take off. To Canada? I don't know, somewhere. I am waiting for someone who gonna love me Waiting for someone who gonna need me, love me and take care of me hold me so I won't be lonely waiting, waiting can't you see why I love you
