How's she running, Dan? She's running pretty Mr McCoy. So far. Well Dan, Mr Alden will be here any minute now to look her over. A mighty good looking job. It will do anything the present engine does and look what we save. I'm the fellow that has to sell it so that the point that interests me. It's a good engine. It will give the public their money's worth. Well, that's about all anybody is entitled to. I made that very point in my memorandum to Alden when I sent him the blueprints. Funny he hasn't said anything about it. Maybe he's forgotten it? He's been looking all-in lately. I thought so too, Mr McCoy. It's worried me a lot. They tell me Dr Harvey has been watching him pretty close. Right. That's all. It is time for your appointment with Mr McCoy and Mr Powers. Give me Mr Thomas, will you. Let me, Mr Alden. Hello? Just a second. Here you are, sir. Oh, Thomas. I've got a suggestion. For minimising the danger from carbon monoxide gas. Yes. Come over to my office at 12:15. I think it is worth talking over. Goodbye. Mr McCoy is in the testing room, isn't he? - Yes, sir. Go ahead. That's queer. Get me a glass of water, will you. It's alright. I hope he won't raise any objection. - He might. He might turn the old black pipe on. Lord forbid. He's alright when he smokes cigars. But when he gets his old black pipe between his teeth .. He means to fight. - Here's hoping he won't. Here he is now. Morning boys. Hello Dan - Good morning, sir. Well. I got your message. Here I am. - Well, chief. We've got a little surprise for you. - A pleasant surprise. Good. Remember the suggestion I made three months ago about the engine? Yes. I said I'd think about it. - Well. I've had it built. Oh .. you've had it built have you? We thought perhaps the blueprints didn't show enough. Do you remember the directors were so interested in the last meeting. Is this is? - Yes. - Let's have a look. She looks wonderful, doesn't she Mr Alden. Yes, she .. She looks wonderful. Start her up, Dan. Smooth as silk, Mr Alden. Isn't that great, chief? And we save 28 percent on the cost of production. How do you save .. the 28 percent? Well, you see the price of material is going up. Oh yes. Yes. Come into my office, boys. Thanks, Dan. Jim. I have the greatest respect in the world for your business ideals. But after all, we're in the game to make money. We are. And we've made money by making the best car. But we are facing a new situation. We are facing greater competition. The reputation of the Alden engine was built on quality. Tamper with that quality .. And you open the door to your competitors. But we are going to put out a good car. - As good as any at the price. These materials are not worthy of the Alden engine. You can't build a good car with poor materials. Look here, Jim. This isn't just my idea and Mack's. The other directors feel the same way about this. They will never support you. You think they won't? - I know they won't. Then let me tell you, Mack. And you, Ed. And your board of directors what's wrong. I started this company. I put the best years of my life into it. As long as I am president. There will be no change in the Alden engine. Except for the better. If that is your final decision. I must ask you to accept my resignation. And mine too. Good day, Mack. Good day, Ed. And I don't accept your resignations. Now, for the next thing. How is your appetite? Fine. How is yours? You could stand a little more weight. - I don't like fat men. Well, I can't afford the time to play with you any longer. I must get back to my office. So you can put away your toys, doctor. - Sit down. I really haven't the time. If my wife hadn't insisted, I wouldn't have seen you at all. You make me take my clothes off at an impossible hour of the day .. I'm not at all satisfied with you. - Well you ought to be. I hope you like my new dressing-gown anyhow. A present from my wife on my 60'th birthday. Alden, you'll have to listen to me seriously. I never could stand doctors. Can you stand the truth? - Yes, if I believe it is the truth. Well, you'll have to give up work. Give up work? How much of it? All of it. You will have to cut out business entirely. The whole thing. What? You don't know what you're talk about. - It's absolutely necessary. It's absolutely impossible. Why, my business couldn't get along without .. Do you think I am going to allow myself to be put on the shelf? Not yet, Dr Harvey. - Alden, I will speak to you plain. Unless you listen to reason. - You're trying to scare me. Forget business. Rest. Sleep. Relax. Play. Positively no smoking. What, not a pipe? - No smoking. Plenty of sun and fresh air. The West. There is the ideal place for you. It's a paradise for a retired man. A retired man hasn't any paradise. I can't do it. [ Door knocks ] Can Mrs Alden come in, sir? - Come in, Laura my dear. Well, doctor? I have just told your husband that he must give up business. I just told Dr Harvey it's absurd. Now Alden, we're old friends and I'm going to speak to you plainly. You say your business cannot get along without you. All businessmen think that. But it's continually been proven .. That no one man is absolutely essential to any big business. Your business can get along without you but .. Can your wife .. Get along without you? You mean ..? You owe it to your wife and your daughter. Daddy. Unless you follow my instructions, I'll not be answerable for the consequences. Six months from now. Jim. Well. I am afraid I .. Hadn't thought of you. And Babs. Well. What shall I do? Alright. Well. That. That's settled, then. I think you said: go West young man, go West. The West? How lovely. The mountains, the fresh air. - Yes. - Paradise. I remember you said that: paradise. That's just about half way to heaven isn't it. Well now, run along all of you. Because I've got to put on my working clothes .. Just .. once more. Yes, dear? I've got to take off this lovely frock you've given me. Although, Dr Harvey wasn't the least impressed by it. But then, Dr Harvey has no taste for anything but medicine. Doctor. Give my wife a list of all the medicines I am to take. Here he comes now. - Here he is now. Goodbye, Tom. I hope the wife is better. - Much better. Thank you, Mr Alden. - Good. So long, Pete. Good luck. It's many good years I'm wishing you, boss. Thank you, Pete. Goodbye. - Goodbye. And Dan. I guess you and I are getting old, eh? My youngest. Jim. The one named after you. - Oh. Hello, Jim. A fine boy, Dan. I've brought him so you could say something to him. Anything, Jim. He'll always be proud of it. Try to be as good a man as your father. Yes, sir. Well, boys. Old friends, most of you. When the whistle blows. We lay down our tools and quit. The doctor has blown the whistle for me. You'll be back with us, boss. - Yes, you will. The business can't get along without you. It's very good of you to say so Dan, but .. I'm afraid it is not a fact. Mr McCoy and Mr Powers will run things from now on. Ed. Mack. It's up to you. It's a good business. Take care of it. And keep up the standard. Good luck to you all. Good luck, boss. Now, I think I'll go back to my office for a moment. We'll come across with you. - Thanks Mack, I .. I think I would like to be alone. I simply love art. Don't you love art? - I adore it. Let me get you a nice piece of buttered toast. Oh, thanks. Excuse me, sir. It is time for your sulfurated wafer. I am afraid toast is not allowed. You never forget anything, do you, David. I have a good memory, sir. Thanks. I am only allowed buttered toast for my birthday. When is my birthday, David? April the 10th, sir. You can call again in the spring. Unhand me Mr Andrews. Babs, you're really getting me quite gaga. So, what am I supposed to do about that? No, I mean it. Really. - You. Did you ever mean anything "really"? You've probably heard that I've played around with a lot of girls. Well maybe I have but not like this. Honestly, this is the first time .. - Yes, I know the rest. This is your first "great love". Forget it. Go and cheer up father. He's awfully bored and lonely. I don't think he looks on me as a ray of sunshine. Well make him. Been trying to for six months but .. He doesn't seem to warm up to me very much. Try again. Talk business. That?s what he likes. I don't know anything about business. Well, try listening to Dad and you'll soon learn. Alright. I'll have to show him what a bright boy I am. Daddy, it's getting quite cool. Now, keep this shawl around your shoulders. Might I suggest .. up .. Off the grass you know. - Thanks. May we talk? I'm really here as an ornament. But you might try. Let me get you a chair. - Daddy, don't be so naughty. Keep still. Carter wants to talk to you about business. So, you're in business? - Well, not exactly "in". My grandfather left me everything. A trust fund you know. He was a great businessman. - Your Grandfather was? Yes, but I have business interests. - Oh. Oh yes. I'm Vice President and one of the directors of the Lakeside Gun Club. It's where they keep the guns, isn't it? - Just so. And then I'm treasurer of the Miramar Kennel club. That's where they keep the puppies, isn't it. ? Yes. And of course I'm on a lot of committees. Really? It is very kind of you to give me so much of your time. Don?t let me keep you. Well if you pardon me I really ought .. I've got three puppies . Business is business. Perhaps you'll come down to the kennels and look at a pup? I'd adore to. - Why go to the kennels? So sorry, but business, you know. That sounds like my husband. See you again soon. I don't think you've seen our kennels before, have you? Laura. Sit down, my dear. I want to talk to you a little. It won't hurt me to talk, will it? Well, this young man .. this .. Andrew Carter. - "Carter Andrews", dear. Well, if you think she's .. Thinking about him more than she usually .. Well, doesn't it seem so to you? I'm afraid it does. Why Jim, there is nothing to be upset about. You know, dear. We can't expect to keep Babs to ourselves always. I can't understand it. Carter is a most sought-after young man. Sought after? For what reason, my dear? Young. Good looking. Good family. - Free puppies? Your tonic, sir. - I'll give him his tonic. Laura. Does Carter Andrews take any medicine? Good gracious, Jim. How should I know? Why? Because he's never done a darn thing and he's still more or less alive. I'm afraid all those people today have been too much for you. But you are feeling better than you were, aren't you? No, I'm not. Have you taken your tonic regularly? - I've done everything I've been told. If I pin my faith to a man in business. I let him use his own judgement without interference. As soon as ever I decided to place myself in Dr Harvey's hands. I realized the fair thing to do was to follow his advice. I have done so implicitly. For six months. I haven't even smoked. Though I have carried my pipe about. And I feel .. - How do you feel, dear? I .. I feel like hell. There, there. Don't get excited. You'll soon feel like yourself again. I don't want to feel like myself. I want to feel like James Alden of the Alden Motor Works. There, there. Run away, my dear. I didn't mean to worry you. You have many things to attend to. Stay here in the air and rest. It will do you good. Can I get you anything, sir? - No! I beg your pardon, Davis. I should have said "no". Shall I move your chair, sir? - I've just moved it. Now what is it, Davis? - Nothing, sir. Won't you sit down? - No, I will not. I may never sit down anymore. Really, sir. And Davis, don't follow me about. You must be tired. Go and lie down. Yes, sir. Ahem. Oh, time for pills? - No, sir. Only someone to see you, sir. Someone to see me? - Yes, sir. You must be mistaken, Davis. Nobody ever comes to see me nowadays. Male of female? Not female, sir. Then I bet 100-1 it's a male. A man probably? Not hardly what you would call a gentleman, sir. I see. Not a bit like you and me. - Well .. What's his name? Excuse me crashing the gates but I saw you in the garden. You are Mr Alden? Of the Alden motor cars? I didn't quite get your name. - Schofield. Schofield is my name. Mr Alden. I want you to pause a moment in the midst of life's busy world. Pause a moment and think. Alright. What about? - The future. As a matter of fact that is precisely what I was doing. You were? Fine for me. Then you must realize how uncertain the future is. If anything happened to you, what would become of your family? Have you ever tried selling life insurance? Funny you should mention that. That's exactly what I am selling. You may have second sight, Mr Alden. But you haven't a second life. You've got plenty of life insurance I've no doubt. But not enough. Mr Alden. You're a young man, yet. Running a great business. I am not running any business. I'm retired. Retired? Uhoh. I wasn't aware of that. Well never mind Life. How about Accident? A man on my books fell down last week. He hit his head on a radiator and .. - Why not Life? Well, we won't insist on Life. - Why not all of a sudden? Well Mr Alden, if you must know. We don't care to touch them when they're retired. You're a cheerful visitor. Can't a man retire and live? I guess he can but he don't. He thinks too much about himself. He mustn't do this and mustn't do that. Mustn't eat this that and the other. Mustn't take a drink. Have a cigar, Mr Adler - Oh, thank you. No thanks. Not now. Let me offer you one. Don't bother please. I'm a pipe smoker myself. Are you? So am I. You are? Say, did you ever try this People's Pride? It's cheap but it's good. Oh well, that's .. That's coarse cut, isn't it. - Don't you like coarse cut? You bet I do. That fine tobacco burns .. I know, burns your tongue. Quite right. Oh but .. Well, thanks. I'm not smoking anymore. Ah, there you are. A weak heart, I suppose? Did you know you'd a weak heart before you retired? I'll bet you didn't. You feel like a fish out of water. Just plain bored stiff. My boy .. you've said it. If I was a man like you, you know what I would do? No, what? Well, I'll tell you. Well Mr Bones, if you were a man like me what would you do, Mr Bones? I wouldn't sit around and wait for the undertaker. Ever read the Business Chances in the paper? Business chances? I can't say I have. Well here we are. Three columns of them. "For sale. Best paying Barbershop in town." "Be a butcher, going concern." No? "Half interest in busy Beauty Parlor." Lay off the busy beauties. "Wanted. Party and $1,000 dollars and self. To manufacture pure grape juice." "Half-finished and old established Insurance Business." Keep out that. It's done to death. "Auto Garage Service Station for sale." I haven't time to read them all but you get my idea? Sure. Well, if I was a retired millionaire. I'd take an interest in one of these little places. And I'd run it. Just as a toy, you know. Something to keep you busy. Well I won't bother you anymore today, but .. I'll call again. Good day, Mr Alden. Glad to meet you. - Good day, Mr Schofield. And thanks for your company and advice. Fool the doctors and live for ever. Not this hat. That's better. Stop at the gas station on the next corner. - Yes, sir. Oh, excuse me, sir. - That's alright. Ah, Peterson? - Yes, sir? What can I do for you? - I understand your garage is for sale. Oh .. it is, but .. I can only let you have a half interest. A partnership. Thanks. I wouldn't want it then. It might be just the thing for a man of your age to have a husky young partner. Well, you're husky enough, but .. - Oh not me. I just sold a half interest to .. That young fellow - you must have met him going out. Oh. Is he an experience mechanic? - One of the best. I'd like to get an idea of your net profits for the past year. Sure. Take a look at that, my friend. Go over the books all you want. You will see the kind of business we're doing. Why, it's like this every day. How much for the half interest? Spot cash. $3,000. And it's dirt cheap. Well, I'll give you $2,500. That's about all it's worth. Take it or leave it. - Can't do it. Remember, I haven't verified the books. I'm taking it on trust. Ah, you can trust me alright. My price is $3,000. I know it is. Mine is .. $2,500. Sold. Who do I make out the bill of sale to? - Make it out to .. Charles Miller. - Alright, Mr Miller. I've got a friend outside who's a notary. We can fix things up right here. That is, if you've got the check with you. I'll bring a check tomorrow. - My price tomorrow will be .. $3,000. Well, I have a check with me but it's not my own. It's made out to me by James Alden. What? James Alden? You mean the big automobile guy? That's the guy. He's an old friend of mine. Say, I'll take all of his checks I can get. Just endorse it, that's all. Excuse me. I'll go and grab my friend the notary before he gets away. Hey Briggs. Come here. We got another sucker. Briggs. I want you to meet my friend Charlie Miller. I've just sold Mr Miller the other half for $2,500. You have? Mr Miller, you're a luck fellow. Mr Briggs here will have everything fixed up for us. In a jiffy. There. And that's that. Oh, Al. I want you to meet the help. Al. I want you to meet my friend, Charlie Miller. Your new boss. Gosh, you don't mean he's bought the place? I just told Al that young Merrick was the new boss. I guess I kinda had him balled up. It's more than 3 o?clock. We'll have to hustle to get these checks deposited before the bank closes. Well, goodbye Mr Miller. - Goodbye. And the best of luck to you. Have a cigar. Al. - Yes, sir? Have a cigar. Oh boy. Thanks. Anything I can do for you, sir? - Yes, lots. I'm your partner. But Peterson? - I just bought the other half. Oh fine. My name is Merrick. Bill Merrick. - Mine is Miller. Charlie Miller. Hey, give me a hand here. The work is piling up. I say, I ought to be doing something, you know. Better not in those clothes. You'll get grease all over them. Come on, I'm in a hurry. Come on, get going. How long do I got to wait around here? We will take care of you in just a minute, young lady. Oh, thank you. I'll polish your wind-shield for you shall I? How fine. Isn't polishing grand exercise. Well, you certainly seem to enjoy your work. Well you see, Miss. I've been on a long vacation. And I've just come back. Drop me off at this corner, will you. I'll take you home. I've got plenty of time. No thanks. I want to buy some tobacco. - Well, I'll wait for you. Thanks, but I like to get a walk before dinner. It gives me an appetite. - Alright. Just as you say. Oops. Oh. - What's the matter? Stiff. Stiff as a poker. Muscles all stiff, eh? - Give me a hand, Bill. Ooh .. ah. How long have you been out of work? Oh, six months or more. That accounts for it. You've had a hard day. Six months? Too bad. Looking for work all the time, eh? You bet I have. Looking for it every day. - You'll be alright in a day or two. Well, see you tomorrow. - You bet. Goodnight, partner. Goodnight. We sure had a good day, didn't we. - We sure did. He didn't say what time he'd be home? Only, that he might be rather late, madam. It's past five. He's missed his cod liver oil, madam. I do wish .. Mother, are you sure he isn't sitting in the car? Here he is now, then. - Dad! Dad! Dad, we didn't know what had become of you. Dear, I am so glad you're home. You gave us quite a scare. Well, well, well. This is a celebration isn't it. It seems to me I ought to go away oftener. What an earth are you doing in that old suit? This? Well, you see .. I was looking over my wardrobe this morning. And this old suit just begged me to take it for an airing. And that terrible hat. Well, the hat goes with the suit. It is my fishing getup you know. - But you surely haven't been fishing? Where on earth have you been all afternoon? Yes, Dad. Where have you been? Well you see, I .. I ran into an old fellow who used to be at the plant. He .. he was tired. He got pretty sick. And he bought a little business. Of course he doesn't do much. He's got a partner who does all the work. Well? Well. It seemed to me that it would be a nice place for me to go .. For a few hours every day. And just talk. Perhaps give him a bit of advice now and then. But Jim, who will look after you? Oh, I shall just sit around. And you're sure you won't exert yourself? My dear, I shall most likely be lying on my back most of the time. Of course, you could take your medicine with you. You will be certain to take everything Dr Harvard prescribes, won't you dear. You know, you missed two doses this afternoon. I will take everything that Dr Harvey prescribed with me. And avoid drafts. Now, stay here and rest a bit before dinner. I'm sure you must be tired out. I am tired. I confess it. - Of course you are. Sitting about in a stuffy office all day. I must say, Jim. You have quite a color. - Have I? Come along Babs, and let your father rest. You've been up to some mischief. You can't fool me. Hello, Mr Miller. - Hello, Bill. You look better this morning. You get a good rest? - Slept like a top. Thought you looked pale yesterday. But today you look fine. Do I? Really? Well I feel like another man. Hey. Did Peterson bring that deed made out to us jointly? Yeah. I've got it inside. - Where is it? I've given it the once-over. - Well, better give it the twice-over. Make sure this place is ours. - Alright. A bullseye. Is the deed alright? No question. We own the place. Well. It's a bit quiet this morning. It sure is. Only one car since seven o'clock. Well. Well, I suppose people do stay at home sometimes. Even nowadays. I suppose you won't be needing me anymore. Why not? - There'd be nothing for me to do. Why, don't you know? The new hundred-foot highway opened up this morning. Palm Avenue. About a quarter of a mile up here. They won't use this street anymore. - What? That's why Peterson sold out. He's got a new place on Palm Avenue. Just opened up today. You ought to see the traffic. - The dirty crook. Just wait until I .. - Wait. You won't get your money back. I can stand losing my money but what about you? You're not young anymore. Did you put in everything you had? - Every cent. He got it for $3,000. Anyone dependent on you? - No. Luckily. Have you? A wife and child. You have? Gee, that's tough. I'm going after that guy. - Stay here. When you go, we'll both go. But we won't go yet. He thinks we're a couple of easy mugs. And up to now, he's right. It looks like it. - Bill. You watch out here. I'm going to try and think this thing over. Ten gallons please. Oh, yes ma'am. Oh. Excuse me. Why yes, what is it? Weren't you at Miss Crawford's school in Detroit? In 1928? Why yes. Of course you don't remember me. Afraid I don't. It was right after the Michigan-Wisconsin game. At a dance. Why yes, I went to a dance with the Michigan team. I was substitute tackle for Michigan. Just a bum substitute. But I did get a dance with you. My name is Bill Merrick - Oh. Of course you don't remember me. Of course I do. We danced together. Then you do remember? Oh! The gas. How much is it, please? Two-five. Two. And a quarter. Oh, Mr Miller. - Hello? That's my partner. He's a great old scout. Never mind the change. I'll call again for it. Will you? Maybe. Well, Bill. What is it? What's what? - Didn't you call? Oh yes, I wanted change but she couldn't wait. Bill. I've doped this thing out. You have? - We've got to leave this dump . Leave it? We can't. - We must. It's a dead horse. You got any relatives? Yes. An aunt. Why? How much is she worth to you? She is the only aunt I've got. How much are you worth to her? A thousand dollars? - I guess she'd give anything she's got. Has she got a thousand dollars? - Well, if she has, it's about all. Come on, Bill. We can't let Peterson get away with this. We'll look over the prospects on the new road. Fight him on his own ground. Don't get lonesome. Well, Bill. We've combed the district. And this seems to me to be the best bet. Directly opposite the enemy's camp. If we can only rent it. Boy, won?t it be a grand fight. And what we can do with all these old beams and arches. You see, Mr Miller. I used to be an architect before the cash gave out. Oh? Gee, I could make a marvellous place out of this. - Could you? Well, you must be a marvellous person. What could you make out of it? - Well, I could .. Could make it look almost like a Spanish mission. Mission Garage? That's the idea: the "Mission Garage". We'll do it. But how can we? We've got nothing. You've an aunt. We take her into partnership. Aunt Mary? She doesn't know a car from a coconut. She will be a sleeping partner. She can sleep all day if she's only got $1,000. Yeah, but suppose she hasn't? - You're her favorite nephew. I'm her only nephew. - Very well, then. Ask her. When I was young, I was a fighter. Here, I feel young today. We'll sell that thing round the corner for what we can. The land's worth a bit. Then you get busy on the designs for reconstructing this whole place. When it's half finished, we can raise a mortgage enough to close the other half. Look here. I've got an idea. - What? Al told me he'd heard you were an old friend of George Alden. Is that true? Jim Alden? - Yep. Well. He has always taken an interest in my affairs. Well then, why don't you borrow from Alden? No. I'll sign the note with you and if we lose, I'll pay him back. No .. I won't borrow from Jim Alden. Why not? Well, Bill. Jim can be a good friend if he likes. But he's got a nasty streak in him. He used to kid me about my independence. If I borrow this money from him now, he'd always be throwing it in my face. He's that sort of man? - That's the sort of man he is. He'd say: "You thought you were very clever Charlie Miller". "But you couldn't get on without my money to pull you through." "You couldn't even fight a low character like Peterson." "Without dipping into my pocket for money." I can't believe anybody would be as mean as that to you. He'd laugh himself sick if I confessed that I had been gypped. By a cheap four-flusher like that. Well, suppose I ask him for you? Excuse me laughing Bill, but .. I know Jim Alden. I only hope that Merrick .. [ Hooter! ] Five o'clock? I had no idea it was so late. I must jump right home on a street-car. I'll take you. No. You'd better go back and stay on the job. I'll be alright. So long. - Son long then. Bill. - Yeah? Send a wire to aunt Mary. - Alright. For the love of Mike. Well, are you getting off or not? What? Well, I guess I've go to. Hello. Sir, if you didn't give me quite a start. I'm blowed if I see you come up. I was just looking at the begonias. Begonias? - Yes. Bless you. Them ain't begonias. They be petunias. - Oh well. That does show us how little I know about gardening. Shall I carry that up to the house, sir? - No thanks. I'll take it up myself. Begonias. That be a good one, that be. I beg your pardon, sir. I wasn't aware that you'd returned, sir. No, I wasn't aware that you were here, Davis. That's alright, Davis. There is nothing I need. You can go. Shall I put this .. These away, sir? - As you like, Davis. Are they for anything, sir. Certainly. I'm going to wear them. Wear them, sir? - Wear them. Might I ask what for, sir? I'll wear them for golf of course. Golf, sir? - Yes, golf. Doctor's orders. - Oh, of course. If the doctor ordered them .. I had better hang them up, sir. Is this Mr James Alden's home? - Yes. I would like to see him, please. - Mr Alden is dressing for dinner. Well, I'll wait until he's dressed. I want to see him on business. Your car, sir? Yes. Mr Alden is an invalid. No-one is allowed to see him on business. Mr Merrick. Good evening. - Oh. Good evening. I'm sorry. I thought Mr Alden lived here. He does. He is my father. Oh. Oh. Then if he's your father. You're his daughter. Why, you must be Miss Alden. That seems to be logic. Then you're his daughter? Won't you come in? Thanks. I'll tell father you're here. If you don't mind, I'd like to ask your advice first. Why, certainly. Won't you sit down? - Thanks. You see, Miss Alden. My partner is an old friend of your father's. Is he really? How thrilling. Yes, it would be. Only you see he's in trouble, and he must borrow some money. How perfectly thrilling. - Do you think so? Gee, it would be wonderful if Mr Alden would. Charles Miller is his name. He's a wonderful old chap and it's wonderful of you. I think it's good of you to take such an interest in him. Well he is my partner you know. He absolutely refused to ask Mr Alden. Of course it would help me too. I wouldn't ask only he's got a wife and child. He put all he had in the service station and that Peterson pulled a dirty deal. That is, he cheated us. We want to get back at the dirty crook. Excuse me, Miss Alden. I absolutely know father will be glad of a chance to help any old friend of his. Will you let me go and tell him about it for you? That would be awfully nice of you. - Just forget it. Dad. Hello Babs. - A Mr Merrick is here to see you. Who? A Mr William Merrick. What's he want? He's come to ask you about an old friend of yours named Charles Miller. Oh .. oh .. Oh, I'm so glad you remember him. Mr Merrick says he's a poor old man who's put all his money into a service station. And is in danger of losing it. - Oh, Indeed? Yes. Mr Merrick says poor old Mr Miller is too proud to come and ask for help. Isn't it pathetic? - Most touching. I'll bring Mr Merrick in. - No you don't. Let me tell you I know this Charlie Miller pretty well. And if he is in a hole I think he can get out of it. Won't you even talk to Mr Merrick about it? If Charlie Miller comes here himself. I'll agree to see him. You tell Mr Merrick that with my compliments. But Mr Merrick is .. - Who is this Mr Merrick? Is he another old fellow too? - No. He's quite young. He is Charles Miller's partner. - Oh, I see. An interested party. - Not at all. He is not asking for himself. Daddy .. - Run away my dear. Dad, I'm certainly disappointed in you. Why, he has a wife and child dependent on him. Who? This Mr William Merrick has? - No. Charles Miller has a wife and child. - Oh, oh. Charlie Miller's wife and child. Yes, I know them. They'll be alright. Dad .. - Run away. I've given you my answer. Father, I hate to say it, but I think it's very mean of you. Mr Merrick, I'm terribly sorry. Father refuses to do anything unless Mr Miller comes here himself. Oh. Well I know Mr Miller won't do that. Perhaps Mr Alden will change his mind? Perhaps. But I don't think so. I wanted so much to help you. I appreciate it a lot. Goodnight, Miss Alden. Hello Pete. - Howdy, Briggs. Just the man I wanted to see. Hey listen, I've got more work than I can take care of here. Yeah, I see. - I'm a tender-hearted guy. I feel rather sorry for those suckers running my old dump. That old guy Miller seems pretty smart. I wish you'd go round and tell him I can give him a job. You see, Briggs, I have a forgiving nature. I just passed there. It's all closed down. It's been gone for more than a week. - Gone? Yeah. - Already? - Yeah. And they never even came around here to say goodbye .. To the one man who might have been their best friend. Well, I tell you. I must say they took it lying down. A couple of weak-kneed quitters, eh? - Yeah. Hey, Pete. What are they doing with that old place across the way? That? Search me. I've been too busy to pay much attention. I have seen a couple of trucks going in and out of the alley at the rear. Looks sort-of like a chapel. You'll be able to sit here and listen to the hymns. Yeah, maybe I'll get religion. Bill. Do you think Peterson knows anything? - I don't believe he has a suspicion. We've always come in the back way and kept the whole place boarded up. Then here is where he gets a shock. Boys. All ready? - You bet. Let her go! - Alright, boys. Look. They're pulling the boarding down now. Briggs. Do you see who that is there? Why, that's that young Merrick. And as I'm a living soul. There is that old fox, Miller. Look at Peterson's face. I can't keep my eyes off it. - No. Remember, you don't get many moments like this in a lifetime. Make the most of it and say to yourself: "Bless aunt Mary and her money". - I do. You might add: "deliver us from Peterson. Amen". Bill. Your prayer has been answered. Here they come. Oh, it was you! Looks like as if they got you scared to death, Pete. Nah. They got a nerve. But I've got the money. And I'll break them if it takes my last cent. Mr Miller. Look! Do you see what he's done. We can't stand the racket. We can't go any lower. No, and we won't. We'll try another trick. Look, Dad. It's cheap gas. Well, how many gallons, buddy? - Bootleg, eh? Well, I'll take a chance on my stomach but non this $15,000 dollar baby. I'll take two gallons. No .. better make it three. Don't strain yourself, stranger. Oh Mr Merrick. - Hello. How charming. I've been looking for you everywhere. Have you? - Yes. You owe me 20 cents, you know. Oh, so that's .. I went to your old place and found it shut up. How did you get the money for this one? We sold the old place. My aunt Mary gave us her last thousand dollars. My partner raised a mortgage on this. Say, you've got to meet him. Mr Miller. - What's the trouble, Bill? Dad! So you know my partner? Why. Miss Barbara and I .. are old friends. Aren't we, Miss Barbara? Yes. Yes, why .. Bill. When Miss Barbara's father bought their first limousine .. I was the family chauffeur. I used to drive this little lady everywhere. I don't suppose I could count the times she has fallen asleep in my lap. What is this, a family party? How long have I got to wait for gas? Pardon me. How long? How much? Five gallons and make it snappy. I've got a home to go to. Dad, would you mind telling me what on earth you are doing? I knew you were up to something. I'm Charlie Miller. Ooh, Dad. A double life. Don't tell Bill Merrick. He thinks I'm next door to the poorhouse. A wife and child, you remember? It's pretty nice of him to want to help you though, isn't it? But you'll catch it, Dad. Wait until mother finds out. Who is aunt Marry? She is our sleeping partner. Oh! You wicked old sinner. Gee, isn't this great? You didn't tell me you knew Mr Miller. I didn't remember the name. You see, we always called him "Dad". He's a knock-out. He certainly is. Well, I must be going. Thank you Mr Merrick for bringing us together again. Thank you too .. Dad. Don't mention it. Dad. I'm going to call you Dad after this. May I? Yes, if it will help you in your business. Bill. That's the most wonderful girl I've seen in all my life. That is your settled opinion of her, is it? And to think. She once fell asleep in your lap. Gosh. Bill. Do you mind if I make a suggestion? No. I wish you would. - Then I suggest you shut off the gas. Oh. Charlie Miller. What will I get to keep your secret? - What do you want? A pearl necklace. You are a bandit. How was business today? - Marvellous. We're making money. Still be able to pay off aunt Mary, eh? Dad, why did you let the poor old lady do that? Because I didn't know of any other way of getting a thousand dollars .. Without borrowing from James Alden. And I was determined not to do that. Suppose she hadn't the thousand dollars? - Well. I should have to go under, I suppose. Mr Merrick too? - Uhuh. Is he married? No. Why? Oh, nothing. Babs. How is it your car need so much filling up on the road lately? Because Turnbull doesn't fill it I suppose. Why doesn't he fill it? Because I told him not to. Why? Because I like to come to the mission. And buy what is beautiful. Why? Dad, don't keep on saying why. Babs, you're turning that young man's head and I won't have it. Well, what are you going to do about it? He is your partner. I can't help what he does with hair. - Yes, you can. You can stay away. He's a nice young man but he's not in your set. He is just a workman. - Just a workman? That's no disgrace. You were just a workman once. - That's a long time ago. I can't have you coming day after day and interfering with business. Understand? You've got Mr Carter Andrews. - Carter Andrews? Ha! Be satisfied with him. I wouldn't have believed a few weeks could make such a change in anyone. Jim, you look wonderful. You always take your tonic with you? - Oh, always. Here it is now. See? Two doses gone already today. That's right. And how is Mr Stevenson? Stevenson? Isn't his name Stevenson? Your old friend at the office. Oh yeah. He's alright. He sent his regards to you. Don't you think you ought to offer him home for dinner one night? Well .. he's a very shy man. But .. but I'll ask him. Dear me. That's a very noisy car arriving. It seems to me I know that rattle. It can't be Mr Carter Andrews. In his ten-thousand-dollar roadster. It sounds like something less expensive. Mr Merrick calling for Miss Barbara. Mr Merrick? - Yes, ma'am. Barbara? Did you expect him? - Well, not exactly. Tell Mr Merrick. That Miss Barbara is not exactly at home. Never mind, Davis. I'll tell him myself. You were right on the minute. - When you say 8:30 it means 8:29 to me. Oh, you have a new car. It does look lime new, doesn't it. Dad and I painted it together. Inside and out. Oh, do you mind getting up a minute? - What is it? I just wanted to make sure it's dry. I want to get away quickly before anyone comes. It usually does this. It's almost sure to go though, sometime. Well, it's bound to go. Sometime. Hurray, she's going. - Good. Just dropped in to say hello. Well that's too bad, Carter. We're just going out. Not at all. Not at all. I couldn't have stayed more than a minute. I've .. Got a director's meeting at the kennel club. Goodbye Carter! Jim. Did you see that? She's gone off with that young man. And left Mr Carter Andrews flat. This is rather serious. I should almost call it alarming. Jim. You must speak to her. We don't know this young man. He might be a burglar. I'll bet that's what he is. He looks like a burglar. Oh no, I don't agree with you. He looks rather nice. Nice? Why, he's only just a working man. Not a bit like Mr Carter Andrews. Now you know you don't like Carter. Are you poking fun at me? And what is the matter with your hands? They are quite rough. Hands .. why ..? So they are. But I noticed them at dinner. It can't be the tonic working out, can it? Could it be the cod liver oil? - Of course. Then it must be hard work. Don't be stupid. I'll give you some glycerine to rub in them at night. Well Laura. How you used to fuss about my hands. When I was a young mechanic. Like that. Those were great days, weren't they. I always liked your hands, Jim. Don't you sometimes wish we could .. travel back? Be young again? Like that. I think you're very nice as you are. But you've got to talk to Barbara. If that young man comes here again .. I'll talk to him. Come on, my dear. Isn't the moon lovely. It's wonderful, Miss Alden. A full moon. Yes. Some people go out of their minds when there is a full moon. No responsible for their actions. Do they? - Yes, Miss Alden. Oh, please. Not so much "Miss Alden". Call me Barbara. May I? - Or Babs for short. Babs is a nice name. But I love "Barbara". - What? Only .. gee, isn't life strange. Don't you think when two people .. Well. Difference in station makes a lot of difference, doesn't it. Does it? Yes, I suppose it does. You know, I like that new gas station of yours much better than the old one. I mean station in life. I think it's terrible for a young man to be .. Attracted to a girl far above him. But I suppose people can't help being attracted. Ah, but I mean love. Fall in love. I think a man without money who tells a girl he loves her is a scoundrel. Do you? I wouldn't give that for a man who can't control himself. It's a .. It's a cowardly thing to do. Oh Bill, isn't the moon wonderful? Barbara. I love you. Hey, careful with that water. Bill. That's the ninth time today you've sprinkled this driveway. And the third time you've nearly drowned Al. What's the matter with you? I'm sorry, Dad. I've been sort of goofy all day today. Goofy? Dad, I've got to tell you. She said yes. Who did? - Why, Barbara. Miss Alden. You mean to say ..? - Yes, I asked her. I know it wasn't the right thing to do. She said yes. Do you consider you are in a position to marry a girl like that? No. But we're making money here now. And as soon as I can see $12,000 cash I'll quit this and become an architect. Deserting me, eh? Sorry about that. But for her sake .. - What about your family? Compared with hers? - Well. I've had a good college education and as for my family .. Well? I don't talk about it much. One of the oldest in the country and as good as any. Bill. Have you spoken to her father? Gosh, I hadn't thought far ahead. Then I should say your troubles are just about beginning. What am I going to say to the old crab? Yes, what are you going to say to the old crab? It would be different if I was a practising architect. But being a garage man, he's sure to think I'm after his money. Perhaps you are? Don't say such a thing. I wish he hadn't a cent to his name. I know. - I don't care what anyone says. I will have it out with him. I'll talk to him. He's a terror when he rows, I know. - I don't care. I'll go for him. He'll turn you out the house. - Will he? I'll meet the old moneybags. He'd cut Barbara without a cent. - I'd like that. If he does, I'd tell him I hope he chokes. You will? You will tell him that? - I will. I'll tell him. My dear Mrs Alden. You mean to say that your husband has an office in town? Where he and this old gentleman pretend they're in business? How very amusing. What a pleasant-looking place. Drive slowly now, while we're passing it. Not pass. Please, some gas. I need. People, come! Quick. People. This is one of Carter's prize dogs from the kennels. Is it? Ten gallons gas. - Alright. But you were saying? Mr Alden's improvement has been quite remarkable. He looks ten years younger. And he's quite himself again. He no longer complains about taking his medicine. Well that's a bonus. Quite. Two-five mum, please. - Keep the change. Oh thank you, ma'am. Attractive little place, isn't it. - Very for this sort of thing. So attractive. - Ah! Alright, madam. Keep the change. Change? Courteous service all hours, ladies. Drive on, thank you. All a lie. I'll tell you when I get home. Howdy, Bill. Hey. You got things fixed up pretty slick here. Where is old Charlie? Mr Miller? - Yes. In the office. - Thanks. Well, how are you neighbor? Hello Peter. I'm a man who comes down to brass tacks. There ain't room enough for both of us here and I want to buy your place. I'll offer you seven thousand cash. I don't remember putting up any notices that this place was for sale. My partner must have done it. - Now look here, Miller. You don't seem to appreciate the chance I'm giving you to get out from under. Out from under what? Get out from under the freeze that I can put on you any minute I want to. Oh .. you think you want to freeze us out do you? Do I? Ha-ha. You play poker, don't you? You think I'm bluffing. Well let me tell you .. I got you just where I want you. Well you've got us just where you don't want us. You think you can run us out of business, we're going to run you out. You're on the run now. And I call your bluff. Mine is a straight with the ace of clubs. A top. What's yours? Now look here, Charlie Miller. I'm a good fellow. Why, I started you in business. Now you and me don't want to have no trouble. I'll listen to your idea of the right figure for the place. Well. Bill. Peterson wants to buy our place. You willing to sell? - Sell? For twelve thousand. - Twelve thousand? That's nearly double what you put into it. Twelve thousand. Why that's just the sum I .. No, of course. Half of twelve is six. And there is the mortgage and aunt Mary. No good to me, Dad. No good to us, Peterson. It's murder. But I'll give you thirteen thousand clear. Done! - Dad. You're a bad mechanic but you're a good architect. You're going to be an architect. - What of you? He'll give me a job. What you say, Peterson? Give you a job? I'll adopt you. You can whistle money off of trees. I've got a bill of sale all ready made out to save time. Fourteen thousand. Briggs, punch it. You've got it in your back pocket. Have a cigar. Thank you. My dear. I've often wondered how you look when I'm not with you. And a perfectly strange man comes up and kisses you. Now I know. You blush beautifully. Oh go on. Mrs Andrews will never get over it. - That's true. Like I said. But I can't understand why you are so well. The doctor said .. - The fact is my dear .. There are a great many things that doctors don't know. When we came west, I was tired of the grind, the routine. That's all. When an active man of 60 shows signs of fatigue. The remedy is not to put him to bed. But to give him some change of employment that will occupy his mind. Doctor Harvey is an alarmist. Doctor Harvey, sir. Doctor Harvey? Our doctor Harvey? - Yes, sir. Show him in. Is this your work? Laura? Have you been deceiving me? - Certainly not. I'm as much surprised as you are. My dear lady. My dear Alden. Forgive me for coming so unexpectedly. Well, this is a surprise, Dr Harvey. I wanted to see for myself. Just how you are. Well, how am I? - He's wonderful. You ought to be proud of him. - I am proud of him. But I want to look you over myself. Now doctor, I'm not going to undress any more for you. You can come into the library and I'll say 99 for you there if you like. No more dressing-gowns for me. Excuse us, my dear. Please, madam. These two gentlemen asked to be announced but .. Not to let Mr Alden know. Mr Power? And Mr McCoy? Show them in, David. - Yes, ma'am. Well, you're a marvel. - I know it. And what a wonderful doctor you are. Upon my word, you're pretty nearly normal. Pretty nearly normal. - Am I? Then, doctor. May I have a pipe? - Ha. Well just once. Now and then. Now. I'll just write you a little prescription. A little toning up and .. You can discontinue your present medicine entirely. Discontinue it entirely? Oh, doctor. That will be a relief. There. Just take that for a few months and you'll be quite alright. Mr Alden. I'm going to allow you to live the life of a normal man again. Dr Harvey, you overwhelm me. I suppose the first pipe tastes .. Rather good, eh? It certainly did. Does. I've got a new tobacco here. Look here. The People's Pride. It's cheap but it's good. Is it all over? - Oh come in, Babs. Well, Barbara. Your father has made wonderful progress. I'm so glad you think so. Because. I've been waiting to speak to you, Dad. Oh? Then I will go and acquaint Mrs Alden with the result of my examination. She will be anxious. Yes, Babs? - Dad. There is something I ought to tell you. Can you stand a shock? I might. Anyhow the doctor is within call. Is it something about yourself? It's about me and .. - Wait. I know what it is .. don't tell me. I can read it in your face. You've been secretly married to Mr Carter Andrews. Dad, I hate Carter Andrews. Mr Merrick to see you, sir. Show him in. But Dad, it's about me. You haven't told him? - Told him what? No, but .. - Shush. Hide behind my chair. And keep quiet. Don't be sweet to him. - Stay down. Ahem. [ Coughing ] Ahem. Mr Alden. Who is it? Bill Merrick. Who is Bill Merrick? Bill Merrick. Well, what do you want? I want to marry your daughter. Now Bill, what is aunt Mary's address? I want to send her five thousand. Mr Miller! Call me Dad. Barbara. Jim. There are two friends. Barbara. My dear, she is only doing what you did at her age. She's chosen a working man. Mr Alden. McCoy. Power. What's happening here tonight? We can't get along without you, chief. We want you to come back. - Oh. You want me to come back. We need your judgement and advice. It's just as you said, Mr Alden. The new engine is a mistake. We brought the doctor along with us to see if you were well enough to return. Oh .. now I see. A conspiracy. Well .. what does he say? You know, I always obey the doctor's orders. Mr Alden, you may go. You are quite fit to take up the reins again if you go slow. And conti?ue to follow my advice. You see, my dear? The doctor was r?ght. All I needed .. was rest. T-G o?
