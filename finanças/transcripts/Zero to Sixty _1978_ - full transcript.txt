Why are you chasing me? [POLICE SIREN BLARING] Oh, thank you, Dan. Thank you very much. Thank you. Dan, congratulations. Thanks. See you off at 10:00, huh? Great. I'll kill her! I'll kill both of them. Michael, Michael, why are you so angry? You're free! Free. Free? Are you out of your mind? I'm in alimony bondage for the rest of my life. How can you do this to me, Arthur? It wasn't easy. Lunch? I don't understand. I did all the right things, I went to all the right schools. I worked for 18 years at a rotten job with a company I hated. I wore all the right clothes, saved my money, now I'm flat busted. Congratulations!Thank you. [HORN HONKING] Michael, don't be so upset. Jog! Jog? Yeah, it eliminates aggression. I don't want to eliminate aggressions. I'm furious. I'm angry. I'm also broke. Give me a dog with everything on it. What do you want it? In your ear. How could you have let this happen to me? Me? You married her, not me. Here, keep the change. The question is, why? Well, she said she was pregnant. I wanted a kid in the worst way. So did she and there he is. That's the boy that cleans out my pool. I think he's been dipping in it, too. This son of a bitch is driving my car. Not anymore. Not your car. This is your car. No, no, no, no, no. That's her old white Cadillac. No, she still owes five payments on that. Dan says your clothes are in the trunk. Every month I gave her money to pay for the car, right? Every month she put the money in her own bank account. Right. Now I owe $1,000 on her car, on that car? Your car. And my house? Her house. Remember you gave it to her? No, no, I didn't. Oh, I just signed it into her name for tax purposes. I mean, for God's sake, that's not giving it to her. No, she gave it to you. And my furniture. My antique pool table. My bill. A hundred dollars an hour. From breakfast through dinner. Portal to portal, Michael. You know, plumbers, electricians, lawyers they're all getting it today. In the neck, that's where they're getting it. Now how in the hell am I going to pay for this, Arthur? Oh, with my salary garnished by her, at a job that I hate, that I want to quit. Then a car that I owe $1,000 on, with no place to sleep. Need is the mother of invention. Arthur, you're absolutely right. Can I bunk in with you for a couple of days? Well, now I have one fast and hard rule. I never sleep with a client. No offense. Arthur, I'm taking your car. Why are they always so ungrateful? Where you going with my car you rotten little kid? Up yours. What are you doing... Oh, hello Captain. Arthur Dunking here. Hey, I'd like to report a stolen car. Who stole it? A former client. Nail the ungrateful wretch. [HONKING] What the hell?

Hey, hey, relax. Hey, relax. That kid stole my car. Dead beat. He owes a grand on this Caddy. You own a white Eldorado, license number 407 NCZ? Yeah, yeah, that's right. Where's the ownership certificate? Well, at the bank, the bank. You don't own diddly. Well, I owe the bank, I'm behind five payments, but they never complained. They don't complain, they repossess. Repo, repossess? You got a polite letter from the bank, saying this is a friendly reminder? No, no. I never got that. And then you got one on blue paper saying you had 10 days to pay? No, I never got one of those. You got a third one on red paper? That was from the bank? I thought it was a Christmas card. [ALL EXCLAIMING] Kiss your car goodbye, it's in the impound lot.

Hi, officers, come on in. Oh! Hey. Hi. When'd you start dealing in hot cars? Oh, what are you talking about, Joe? Well, there's a 77 Cadillac Seville with the front smashed in outside your garage. It was reported stolen. By who? By the owner. An attorney. The son of a bitch. Hey, why would you be calling him a son of a bitch? Just a figure of speech. And who are you? I never seen you around here before. Ah, I'm new. What's your first name? No, no, no, you see, I came here... Oh, Joe, he's one of my boys. I just put him on. Right, guys? ALL: Yeah, yeah. Come on, Joe, don't hassle me. Well, all right. Oh, by the way, Flo. Somebody's been ripping of stereo cassettes and spare tires from the repos. I'll handle it, Joe. Why don't you do something worthwhile, like hassling hookers. Yeah, if you get any numbers. Have them call me here. Sammy Darvino. We'll keep our eyes open, officer. We'll let you know if anything happens, looks fishy. [EXCLAIMS] I knew you looked wanted. Wanted? So you're a car thief. Car thief? Car thief? No. Well, you drove a car without permission. Well, yeah. ALL: Then you're a car thief! You're just like us. [ALL EXCLAIMING] We're legal, don't you forget that, eh? Enough of this crap. Flo, what's new on Pete? Still in the hospital. Light me, baby. Oh. You want a job? No, no, no, Flo. I'm not going to ride with this crumb. No way. Shut up, Larry. Got all your teeth? All but one.You don't take care of your teeth, then you don't take care of anything else. Now my husband had big beautiful teeth. And the rest of him was too. She took over the business when her old man kicked the bucket. Yeah, yeah, she wore him out. Well, I'm as strong as a horse. Look at these knockers. Firm as teeny bopper's. How old do you think I am? Oh, about... Twenty-nine. [ALL EXCLAIMING] [PHONE RINGING] Got it. Tip on Gloria. Oh, come on, well, give it to me. Okay, the kitty on Gloria is up to four hundred. It'll cost you twenty. There we go. Okay, swifty, you're hired. Show him the ropes. Double crap. Oh, here. Fill this out for the cops. And Larry, please don't lose Gloria this time, huh? I mean if you were smart as Gloria, I'd be a millionaire by now. Oh, listen, listen, in this business you got to expect to be shot every seven years. Thanks. I'll work for six. MIKE: Who's Gloria Martine? LARRY: A flake we've been trying to catch for a year. Damn! What is all this junk? Stereo, CB, a police band radio... There's no room for my knees. Well, shrink. Shrink? No, I never needed one until now. What are all these holes in the dash for here? It used to be a cop car. A cop car. What am I doing here? All I ever wanted was a nice home, a family, kids, Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. Whatever happened? Wait a minute, there is a car... Are you trying to kill us, you crazy kid. Get us killed. Finch, he's one of the biggest criminal lawyers in town, owes 18,000 bucks on that Mercedes. So? If we beat him home, we can grab him now. Get out. And do what? Lie down in front of the gates. Lie down in front of the gate. Are you crazy? He'll stop. He'll stop. Trust me. Will you go on, lie down. I'll wait here and grab the car when he gets out. Will you go on? Lie down?Hurry up, go! You mean, lie down here? Well, hurry! Go on, go on! Well, what... What if he doesn't stop? He'll stop, he'll stop. Oh, my God! [HONKING] You know, I thought he'd stop. You thought? You thought? The only thing that would have stopped him was a Sherman tank. He ran over me. He ran right over me. Yeah, well, sometimes you can't figure these flakes. Come on, move it. You can't figure these flakes? Give me my coat and hat from the backseat. If that lawyer, what's his name, Finch, if he's so successful, how come he owes $18,000 on that car? He's very unlucky. He hits Vegas at least twice a month. Flies up, walks home. Bosses don't like it. A lawyer who runs over people. I'm beginning to see the possibilities of great joy in this job. [BRAKES SQUEALING] What are you doing down there? Oh, Christ! That's her, Gloria! Give me that repo slip. Repo! Repo! Repo! No, no, look out! LARRY: Oh, Jesus. [GROANING] Where'd she go?

Well, come on, haul ass. You in the alley. Silver Trans Am. If I find it, do I lie down in the street in front of it? Lie down in the middle of the street. I must be out of my mind. Trans Am, huh, a silver Trans Am. There's no silver Trans Am in this alley. Gloria? Gloria Martine? Gloria! [GROANING] Sorry. Son of a bitch! Hey! What the hell are you doing taking a nap? Wake up, you bum! Hi. Hi, he says. Didn't you see that Trans Am? What Trans Am? You mean to tell me you didn't see Gloria take that car out of here? No. Where did she go? Oh, well, to hell, for all I care which is just where you can go. Well, I did see a girl. A gorgeous brunette. Wow, well, very good. Congratulations! This caper just cost us 20 bucks. Gimme 10. Well, I'm flat. Ah, another loser. What do we do now? We? I'll see you at the office. Where's the office? Where the hell am I? Where the hell were you? I've been waiting here since 7:00. Well, I told you midnight. No, you didn't. You didn't say anything about midnight. You said I'll meet you at the office. Midnight, I said, midnight. You don't repo cars before midnight. They'd have to be nuts. The least you could have done was to tell me. Ah, shut up. Well, if you'd just listen to me... All I know is I came, I knocked on the door, there was nobody here, right? So I thought somebody would be here, but no. There was nobody here, so all I could do was knock on the door. I thought Flo or somebody would come around, but nobody came around. I was standing there all by myself, in the cold, waiting for somebody to show up and nobody showed up. Oh, shut up. There the unit. A Buick. What's this? The impound order, stupid. Read it. Vehicle identification number, make, model, serial, license... Oh, permission to steal, huh? Year? Ah, 1969. What's a nice girl like you doing in a rotten business like this? Hand me that tackle box on the floor in back. I'm serious. My old man was a car thief, okay? These are the tryouts. It takes time to go through them, but it's neater than nitro. Nitro? Yeah, that's what my last partner was using when he got shot. Terrific. And what happened to your father? He got caught and got sent away for two years. Here, look up the model number and year and read me a set of numbers that's next to it. Five, five, four. Two years, huh? Yes. Two, four. Well, two years, that's not so bad. He was killed in a prison riot. Next? Next? Six, five. How long... Okay. All right this is what we take to the unit. This, picks, ignition puller and a flashlight. Flashlight, huh. Good. Yeah, it's black out there, why after midnight? Earlier you get your ass shot off. Oh, that's a good reason. Now when you get out leave the door half open. If we have to split in a hurry, we don't waste time. "Leave the door half open." Keep your body low so nobody can see you. I know. Stay on the far side of the unit with your eyes peeled. "Eyes peeled." Now when I start the unit, you take my car and get the hell out of here. At the end of the block I'll pass, you follow me to the impound lot. You got it? Yes, yes. You go out, take your car, I mean, unlock... Yeah. Got it, got it. Okay, good, let's get going. I think I'm going to throw up. [GRUMBLES] [CAR APPROACHING] Scooch down, quick. One hundred, Ford DD. Hey, we've been looking for this unit for six months. Hey, why don't you take this one? Hey, it's a piece of cake. Me? Yeah, yeah, the motor's still running. Go on, it'll be your cherry. Cherry? Cherry? Chicken, are you? Chicken? Shit. Okay, okay, okay. I'll do it, I'll do it. Go. I will, I will. Just give me a minute, will you? What am I doing here? I think I just wet my pants. Will you go on. Go on! [WHIMPERING] Go on, go on. [ALARM RINGING] A piece of cake? Some frigging piece of cake that was. That son of a bitch was going to beat my head in. What are you bitching about? Did you see my rear window? What about it? Well, there isn't any, that's what. That bastard shot it out. I mean, he was trying to kill me. Kill me dead. Listen, I've been shot at before. Sure, I mean, people take potshot, you know, it's nothing serious, but that bastard, I mean, he meant to kill me. He really did. But why? You're polluting the atmosphere. Well, it won't turn off. There's no key. No key?No key, no key. What are you doing? Hotwired. Those guys popped this car earlier! They stole it? Yeah. [LAUGHING] Oh, boy! I'd like to have seen the guy's expression on his face when he saw you sitting in his car. I sat there like a dummy, gunning the engine, with the gear shift in park. Oh, my God, I'm starving to death. Come on. Let's hit the diner. Well, how'd you like the first night? How many cars did you pop, Nolan? Well... BENNY: Push, push, push, you kept yelling and you pushed the car right over my foot. How do you feel, Benny? You're another clown. How do you feel? Okay, animals, feeding time. All right. All right.

MIKE: What are we doing here? Isn't it that lawyer Finch's house? Yeah. Finch, the fink. You bet. MAN ON RADIO: And now for the late news. Willie Bighums, president of the Loaders and Carriers Union was abducted from the Red Cock Inn earlier this evening. Witnesses say he was seen entering a parked car, nothing more has been heard from him as of this time. And now back to our regular program. Look at them. Mercedes 600, a Jag and a Rolls Royce. Boy, I want that Mercedes so bad, I'd give up sex. What about the others? They might be wanted, too. Not by us. [SIRENS BLARING] Oh, the cops are hot tonight. Okay, let's go pop that hog. Pop that hog? Repo a motorcycle, Jesus, are you dumb. [WOMAN LAUGHING LOUDLY] When do they sleep? At noon. Hanging upside down like bats. So where can I drop you? Where my clothes are. You're sleeping here? The price is right. I don't know anything cheaper. Come on. Get in. What? Come on, get in. Well? Well, it's, it's... I'm decorating it myself. No kidding! Yeah. Wait till you see the inside. [LAUGHS] Yeah, I can hardly. [1970s MUSIC PLAYING] [LOWERS VOLUME] Come on, it's my favorite song. Are you moving in or out? I told you it was terrific. Terrific! It's unique. Well, that's how I wanted to do it, "unique." Sheets in the closet, blankets under the couch. Where's the couch? It's right there. Oh, sure, I can deal with that. Yes. Well, let's see here. What do I do with your laundry? Oh, here I'll take them. Okay. Oh, you can hang your clothes there. No, no, no, no, not that closet. That one is a killer. This closet. Okay. Oh, yeah. Can I ask you a personal question? That all depends on the answer. How come you live all the way out here, all alone? It's safer. Safer? Out here? Listen, when I was a kid, years ago, I kept getting hassled by the heat because I wasn't in school. What, did you quit? Ninth grade. Boring. I got a job in a five and dime for eating money. There was this one cop, I think he was some kind of pervert, he kept on hassling them so they'd fire me. One day he followed me home. He told these people I was living with what had been going on. You see, they only get paid if the kid attends school. Paid by who? Oh, city, county, who in the hell ever. So, I... Why? Because they sent my old man to prison, nobody to take care of me. Well, what about your mother? She skipped earlier. So I went down to City Hall, got my birth certificate, lit out of that town and came here. How? In an 18 wheeler driven by some old Southern boy who kept on getting my knees mixed up in the gear shift. The only thing that saved me was he couldn't do it to me and keep his hands on the wheel at the same time. How old were you? Fourteen. Fourteen? How'd you survive? By stealing. Well, it was better than hooking, I'd seen enough of that on the street. Anyway that's why I live out here. That's why they're there, huh? Blanket, blankets. Two birth certificates. Five years difference. WOMAN ON RADIO: ...license number 100 ODD. Anyone knowing the whereabouts of this vehicle... 100 ODD? Don't touch them! Put that down. It's none of your damn business. I pulled the blanket out. These came out with it. Well, don't touch them. Well, I'm sorry, it was an accident. Yeah, but you had to read it. Well, I... It was an accident. You didn't have to read it. Okay, okay, so I read it. I'm sorry. I'm not going to tell anybody. Tell them what? Well, that you're only 16-years-old. Shut up! And that you faked your birth certificate. You rat fink, you tell anybody that, I'll kill you. No, no, I won't. I swear to God, I will. I swear it. I won't, I won't, I swear. I criss-cross, cross my heart. Okay. Nosey. No, no, it was an accident, I swear it was. But I would like to know, what was the number of that car that we picked up tonight? 100 ODD. I never forget numbers "100 ODD." MAN ON RADIO: On the Bighums disappearance, anyone knowing the whereabouts of a brown late model sedan, license 100 ODD. I repeat, 100 ODD. I think we're in a little trouble. Yeah, why? I think Willie Bighums is in that car. So what do we do? We got to have a plan. Right, a plan, a plan! A plan? Yes, we examine the alternatives, agree on the objective, zero in on the goal, that's what I learned in the last company I was working for. What did you do? I was Director of Planning and Research. So what's the plan? We take him back. What? Yes, we take him back where we found him. Right, right! Wait a minute! One of us has to drive that car. No, no, I drove it last time. No, no, no, it's your turn! LARRY: I think we're being followed. MIKE: Turn left, we'll find out. [MIKE SCREAMING] Get off. Get off of me! What the hell was that? [SCREAMS] [LAUGHING] I'm gonna sleep for a week. We're home, honey, wake up. Come on, dum dum! [EXCLAIMING] Where'd you say the sheets were? Oh, in there somewhere. Good night, sweet dreams, and all that crap. Good night, Lorraine. God! [LAUGHING] LARRY: Goodnight. Good morning. I've been ripped off. [SLOW MUSIC PLAYING] Where's all my things? Well, your library of pictorial fiction is stacked in the corner. Pictorial fiction? Comic books to you. How can you listen to this garbage? [ROCK MUSIC PLAYING] What's all this? It's a tribal rite called breakfast. Sit down! Where'd you get the eggs and bacon? From your neighbor. You stole them? [PHONE RINGING] Borrowed them! I guess. Hello, Flo. You been doing anything illegal lately? No, not me. Well, a couple of guys were just in here looking for you. Cops? Well, if they were cops, I don't know, I never saw any cops with a Cadillac and dark glasses, even the Cadillac had dark glasses. What did they want? Well, they had your name is and your license plate number. They wanna know where you live. You didn't tell them? How can I tell them? I don't even know where you live. Anyway you better come in a little later. They may be gone by then. You know those guys who put Willie Bighums in the trunk of that car? I think we're next. No way will I let that happen. Well, how are you going to stop them? I'll think of a way, I will. I'm very good at planning. So I noticed last night. Well, I haven't had much experience with the disposal of dead bodies you know. Hey! I got it! Now they know this pink car, right? Right. We'll paint it! Paint it? Yes, paint it! It's a great idea you'll love it! Hate it, hate it! You'll learn to love it, believe me! Never, never, never! It looks like a cop car again. I can't stand seeing it look like... [TIRES SCREECHING] LARRY: Gloria! Come on, move it, Gloria! Wait a minute, wait, wait! Shut up!

Come back later and I'll take you home for dinner. Guess who'll be dinner. Thank you very much, I'll repay this as quickly as I can. You will not repay it, it's charity, of course you will will be indebted to me. Well, I think I'll just... I think I'll just try to lose a little weight. Thank you. Ungrateful bastard! Mr. Nolan.

Open the door in there, open it up. You borrow your friend's motorcycle there? Yes, sir, I did. Well, then, why don't you give it back to him? That's a really good idea. Listen guys, it's right out on the street. And, here's your coat too. That's not his coat. You can keep it. All right, all right. Knock it off. We've been missing a lot of stereos equipment lately. I'm taking you in for questioning. You go get in the car. Go on, run. You boys know anything about that? No. Don't watch television. No, we don't know anything about that. No television, huh? [ALL PROTESTING] Hey, where'd you get the gun?

What? Here's your own key to the trailer. I want you to be independent, like me. Come on. Yes. Okay, you can sleep here tonight. Where?Right here. Why? Because I owe you one, and I always pay my debts. Larry, you don't owe me anything. Then why did you do what you did? Well, I only did what anybody would do for a pal. Right, so I owe you one, you can do me. Do you? Larry, I don't really know how to explain this to you, but this is not the generally accepted recommended method of a seduction. Okay, okay, okay. I'm rushing you, right? Well... Relax. Relax. Why don't you sit down, huh? Sit down? How would you like some warm beer? Beer?Yes. Came with a 1964 repoed Buick. Okay. Here. Here. Drink it quick. No, no, no. Wait. Take your time, relax. No rushing, right? I don't really like beer. Well, I'm sorry. It's the best I can do. Okay, you finished? Yes, I've had quite enough, thank you. Good. Let's go back to the bedroom. And do what? What do you mean, and do what? You know. Larry, now listen, I know that you've had a lot of experience. Yes. Yes, but you see, being a man, I really prefer to be the aggressor. You male chauvinist pig. You ought to read Ms. LibMagazine. You'd find out it's okay today. Okay with who? With women, who else? Who else? Larry, in the usual, run of the mill, kind of ordinary heterosexual relationship, there is generally another person present. Usually a male. Now, has Ms. LibMagazine asked them? Who cares?Who cares? Well, it's only 50 percent of the act. Boy, you've really been around a lot, haven't you? Yes! Lots. Wait a minute! You don't think that you're my first, do you? No. I wouldn't think that for the world. No, no. How many? Who can count? Come on. Can we just talk a little bit more? You see, I'm kind of nervous. Talk? Is that all that you're good for, talk? Well, sometimes it takes me longer than it does other times. You understand. Sure, sure, sure. Same as me. Sure, sure. Sure. Well, you ready? No, not quite. Okay, take your time. You want a peanut butter sandwich? Maybe later. Do you think I don't know how? I think you're 16-years-old. What difference does that make? It's just like riding a bike. Once you learn how, you never forget. You're a terrific bike rider. Yes, and I want to learn how to... I mean, and I'm just as good at doing that too. Come on. [CHUCKLING] Larry, Larry, Larry, Larry. [EXCLAIMS] I can't. You can't or you won't? What are you senile or something? Senile? You're probably gay. Well, I don't think so. No, no. You're just senile. That's it. I mean, what other reason could it be? Well, there are a couple.You're too old. You probably couldn't even do it anymore. Well, I... You probably couldn't even get it up with a block and tackle. What? Who'd want an old turkey like you? Well, I can point... Hey, pal, you don't like me, that's fine, why don't you just leave. Just get out. Just get out of here. Get out. You dumb ass broad. Hey, Mike, I'm really sorry. "See you tomorrow night"? Bartender? Could I have another... Bourbon? You go it. Geez, that's funny. That's really a kick in the ass. [CHUCKLING] Block and tackle. You got troubles, pal? But, sex is not the answer to anything. You need an answer? Well, anybody can do it. I mean, what does that prove? I've done it a lot. Probably too much. I've been married and divorced twice. Tell me about it, I've been there too. [LAUGHING] I'm walking away from this situation, I'll tell you. I mean, I don't want that kind of a relationship with Larry. Larry? What's wrong with Larry? There's nothing wrong with Larry. Yesterday morning, I got divorced. Yes. An hour later, I meet the kid on a job and now I'm living with Larry in a trailer. In a trailer?Yes. That sounds like a kick. A kick? You know married life can really be rough. Oh, sure, tell me. Believe me I know. And along came Gene. Yeah? Yeah. Hey, how did you meet Larry? The kid stole my car. Stole your car? Yes, she stole...You're kidding. I don't believe... Oh, no. Larry's not a car thief, not really a car thief. No, no. Sweet kid. Needs a lot, loads of affection, you know. That's my Gene. Just independent as hell. Won't take shit from anybody, you know. [LAUGHING] That is my Gene. Tell me, what the hell to do? Hey, hey. Look, pal. I had the same problem. And then Don came along. Now it's just the three of us. Gene, Don and me. Believe me, we've never been happier. Well, that... That's terrific. Well, listen, thanks for the advice, old buddy. Buy the guys there a drink. Thanks so much. See you around. Yes, come back. Bring Larry. [SPEAKING FRENCH] What are you, a Vassar broad? Smith, to be precise, class of 1965. I smell perfume, thank God. Bartender. Yes, sir, what's on your mind? As if I didn't know. Drinks for all the ladies and a triple for me. What color? The amber, ambrosia in a square bottle, though I admit sometimes I do prefer bonded blond. Well, take your pick. We got every shade there is here tonight. Well, the place is filled with goodies tonight. And biggies. Ah, bartender, these... These ladies wouldn't be professionals would they? Are you kidding? You think I'd let an amateur in here? Well, not her. That's Smith, class of 1965. You are over 21, aren't you? I'm 34, 22, 35. [MIKE GROANING] Good morning. Did you sleep well? When? There's not much in the fridge, I'm afraid, because I only just moved in. But there's more coffee on the stove. I got to go to work, damn it. I would give a week's pay just to stay here and play some more. But I have just so many bills, you just wouldn't believe it. I'd believe it. That bastard. I was married to him for six weeks, he ran up $20,000 worth of bills and then skipped. All he left me with was the car and that's not even paid for yet. Yeah. Do you have to go to work? Believe me, I don't want to go. Hey, why don't you just stay here? I'll be back later and we can pick up where we left off. You're spoiling me. I woke up this morning singing. Nobody's made me sing for a long time. Hey, as a matter of fact, why don't you just, just move in here? Just think of this place as your home. Come and go whenever you please. No strings attached. No strings attached. Honey, you are a real find. Now, in case you run out of cigarettes. Oh, I don't smoke. But you can really light a fire. I'm singing. [HUMMING] Oh. Good morning. Now, I know what you're thinking, Mrs., um... You are thinking, now where is the first and last months' rent on my lease, aren't you? If you just stay right here, don't move. The gentleman upstairs will be right down and he will take care of everything. It's so nice to have a rich father, don't you think? [GROANING] Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. I haven't done this since high school. Ah, you'll never die, you virile bastard. Where you been? I've been waiting for you. Where's your car? Battery's dead. So is mine. Where'd you meet her? Who? The brunette whose perfume you're wearing. Blond, I think. Well, it smells like a brunette to me. Shh. Flo wants me to tell you about Finch, she thinks he's got paper all over town. First National wants the Rolls and State Union's after the Jag. What about the boat? Flo also thinks he's got a private jet at the airport. Jesus, do you stink. I mean what did you have to do, roll around in it. Yeah, I rolled around in it. So what? So what? The least you could've done was just taken a shower. I did. Yeah, and rolled around in it some more. Right? Yeah, I rolled around in it some more. Geez, who needs this anyway? I've been married twice, huh. I never cheated on my wife, never. You, you're worse than both my wives put together. Well, if you don't like it, you can just... I already have. What? I got an apartment of my own. I'm moving in tonight, okay? It's starting to rain. Does thing have a top on it, a roof? Yeah, go on, put it up. Oh, wow. Come on, put it up. Are we going to repossess a whole used car lot? Think you're up to it? MAN: Come on, move your ass. Come on, get a move on. We got 10 minutes for the operation. Let's go. Team one get the J-straps. Team two start working on the transporter. Hurry, this way. Benny, further. What? Further, Benny, further. Holy shit. First and still the best. Right behind you. I don't want you anywhere near me. Is that far in enough? No, Benny. No. No, you dummies, first cars first. I can't get it in. What do you mean, you can't get it in? Here, give it to me, I have a lot of experience. It shows, Flo. It shows. Harry, what are you doing? I'm trying to pick this lock. Harry. What? What'd you do that for?The window is open. Hurry. Move your ass. I've got this one. Get those chains now, quick. Who's got the bolt cutters? Who taught you how to fall? Your mother. Come on, just help me with this chain, would you? Be careful. Be careful. If you think you can do better than me, you get your fat ass in here. Sammy, you Italian creep, don't you know how to drive? I know how to drive, Flo. Stop all this. Come on. Keep it moving. Listen, I'm an intellectual giant. I shouldn't be doing a dumb job like this anyway. Come on, Harry, you meatball. Eddie, we have 10 minutes to finish the job. Which way are you going to go? I'm going that way. Me too. Up your Johnson, Harry. Shut up, Sammy. Okay.Okay. Okay. That way. Stop playing around. Come on. Get that car in the transporter. Get it up there, up, up. All the way. Keep going. Further, further. I didn't mean that far. What happened? Short runway. Well, the bank said to get them out, they never mentioned what condition they had to be in. Another job. Another dollar. And that's for my brother-in-law you sold an Edsel to. Hey, if Flo would've seen Benny and me she would have paid us double. Oh, Flo never pays double. Come on. Okay, what do you guys want tonight? Pancakes, buckwheat. Sausages, well done, two milks, a jar of honey and put an egg on top. Two burgers, rare. Two burgers medium. Three hamburgers, well done.Onions, no ketchup. Cheese well done, rye toast. No onions, no cheese and double fries. No fries on mine. Cancel the two milks and bring me a chocolate shake. Pancakes buckwheat, sausages, well done, egg on top, cancel the milks, chocolate shake, two burgers, rare, onions, no ketchup. Two burgers medium, no onions, hold the cheese, double fries. Three burgers burned, cheese, well done, on rye. And...No fries. Ah, you told her. I want your goodness. Can you believe it? I'll have spaghetti, extra sauce, coke, buttered rolls and a hot fudge sundae. BENNY: Forget about that. My pancakes, I'm starving. You know, maybe I should get pancakes, too. Sure, with whipped cream, strawberries, marshmallows and chocolate sauce. Coffee. A sick-bag for me, will you? WAITRESS: Somebody call the cops! I knew I'd never see those pancakes. We owe him a favor. No!No! What's going on here? [SCREAMING] You go this way, I'll go that way. I'll divert them. You go out the front door. I'll divert, you go out the front. Oh. No! Get your hands off her. Get out of here, run! Let's get out of here. [MIKE SINGING] Hey. You were really wonderful out there tonight. How'd you ever learn to fight like that? Oh, watching, Kung Phooey, Chop Suey. Yeah, me too. [IMITATING KUNG FU] Ah, the army, really. World War I? No, not quite. A place called Korea. Never heard of it. Hey, what are you doing? Packing. Oh, yeah, that's right, you told me. You found a place, huh? Yeah, it's temporary, but the price is right. Cheaper than here? More expensive in some ways. Well... You know, like you said, it'll probably be better this way. Yeah. Anyway, I really need my privacy, you know, I'm so used to living alone. What's the address? Oh, I just remember how to get there. Oh, I got the telephone number in case you need me for anything. Need you?Yeah. Well, why would I need you? Well, you never know. Something might come up. Well, nothing's come up so far. What's this? Oh. You know when I left home, I just grabbed this and threw it in the briefcase. What is it, an antique? Well, yeah, you could call it that. I've had it since I was a kid. Just a bunch of junk here, you know, kid's stuff. Look, a Boy Scout knife. You were a Boy Scout? Yeah, sure. Wouldn't you have known. There's crayons and marbles, and ribbons and medals, and just junk. Wait a minute. I didn't know this was in here. Come on, let's talk about this, huh? Oh, talk again? Yeah, yeah, talk, talk, talk. Come on. Okay. When I was married the first time, well, that's the first time I was married, I mean. I took out an education insurance policy that would insure and guarantee that my kid would have a college education regardless of whatever happened to me. Well, as it turned out, I didn't have any kids. I'd like you to have it. $10,000. I don't understand. Why? Better you than the government. Go on, take it, enjoy it. I don't want it. Why not? Nobody gets anything for nothing. Go on, take it. Listen, it'll give you a whole new kind of life, another chance at something, you know. College, and good jobs, new friends... Hey, now hold it. Just wait one frigging minute. Number one, I happen to have a terrific life. I own my own home, free and clear, paid for it myself, I live in it by myself, until I allowed you to stay here. I own my own car. I don't owe nobody, nothing. And number two, about your good job, I happen to be tops in my profession. All I thought was that you could... Well, don't think. You're in bigger trouble and worse trouble than I'll ever be. You haven't got a home of your own, you've lost your car, you're a two time loser with women, and you are flat broke. I mean you would have starved to death if I hadn't have saved your ass. So, don't give me any of your crap about a decent life, a frigging college education and a good job, because if you are the result of that, forget it! You need it more than I do. You are the most contrary, contradictory, obstinate female I have ever met in my entire life. Well, whatever all that means you're probably right. Yeah. Yeah, here. Here's the number where I can be reached, if you ever possibly want to call me again. Ha. Now if you don't mind, I'll just pack up a few things I've got left and get out. Mind? I will help you! There, give me... I think that's about it. I think that does it very nicely. Thank you very much. You're welcome!Goodbye. LARRY: Morning, Flo. I'll let you know if it is or not, honey. What's up? Hopefully you are, Sleeping Beauty. Guess what? Today is Finch day. It's Sunday, Flo, Sunday! Oh, Finch! Right. Hey, this is the biggy. Lots of bucks! Finch! Ha-ha, Finch. The Bryson Apartments? You're the landlady. Got it. I'll send you your 20. You won't believe this. When it rains it pours, another tip on Gloria. Where's Mike? I've got his phone number. Well, call him. Harry, did you order the vans? Vans? Oh, Christ, I have to do everything myself. Call him, call him. Yeah, okay. What the hell is the matter with you? You don't listen. So who's Larry? My partner. Something must be wrong. We got a job on. On Sunday? Well, I'm in a funny business. Hey, I've got some funny business for you. Mmm? Mmm. HARRY: I want to drive the van. No, dumbo, everybody goes to Finch's and that's that. Did you call the cops? Huh? Like you drive a transport, right? Oh, right, right. He didn't call them. Larry, you do it. Ah, come on, Flo, Mike's plan will work. Absolutely not. He isn't even, here. Now, where is he? He'll make it, he'll make it. Listen, the whole scam starts with me and Benny and Mike at the airport. I'll need the money for the pilot. After we've suckered him out there, I grab the Rolls, while Benny goes ahead and... Well, it's just weird enough to work. Okay, you'll need some money for the Flyboy. Here, and get a receipt. I'll call the cops. Christ, I'll have to do everything myself! Well, come on, get a move on. Larry, give that back. Don't screw up this operation. You can call that Gloria broad tomorrow. Tomorrow is always too late. Come back here, Larry, you little flick. How's the weather? I'm kept so busy, I haven't noticed. Listen, you're getting awful careless about your car. It's Sunday. Who works on Sunday? Sunday is play day. Oh, they should've cast you as Superman. I'm on a diet. No, it's all right. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Who is it? LARRY: The landlady's niece. My landlady's black. You don't sound black. Neither do you. Gloria Martine, I hereby officially... [EXCLAIMS] What the hell's going on? You look better with your clothes on. Who is this child? This is my partner, Larry Wilde. This is... Gloria Martine. You're not a blond! No, I'm not. She's not a blonde. No, she's not. Larry? What the hell is it you to do? Repossess cars. You told me she was a blonde. You are Gloria Martine? Gloria Martine? No. Uh, no, no. You'll have to excuse me. I'm really not dressed for unexpected company. You're not dressed, period. That is Gloria Martine? Martine? I think her name is Smith. Coffee? Coffee? MIKE: Just trying to be hospitable. How did you meet her? I said, how did you meet? She hit me on the head with a suitcase. She did what? In the alley. It wasn't her fault. When? Oh, what difference does that make. When? Well, it seems like years ago. Then all along you knew her. Now wait a minute... You knew her when I was sitting there making... No, no, no. I did not know her then. Know? Well, in the Biblical sense only. Oh, you lousy bastard. Gloria? Gloria Martine? That kid, I'm gonna kill her. MIKE: Listen, I don't know why you're so mad. I mean, she's really a very nice person. Once you got to know her, you'd learn to like her. You see, her old man ran up a out of bills, and apparently, that was what happened. MIKE: You get to know her, she's really a very nice person. What are you doing? Will you take it easy. Christ, you'll get us both killed. Half of that's a good idea. Will you wait a minute? Will you wait a minute? Why are you so upset? Why, for Christ sake, why? Why what? I saw you coming so, I set the wheels in motion. I don't know who you are. That's Mike. Yes, Mr. Finch, that's what he said he was going to do. Who are you? Mike! I'm sorry, sir, but I'm afraid I can't do that. You will have to come out here yourself. There you were, all that time, jumping all over her bones and I was... My, my, my. Such language. Well, up your doodoo too. Just like Pearl Harbor. Pearl Harbor? Stabbed in the back. Oh, damn it! Damn it! I said... I said... Tell Sal and the boys get out there, quick. And get rid of the books. The books, you dummy! Why her for Christ sake? Why not me? She's gorgeous, sexy, uninhibited and very athletic. So what? I'll put a trapeze in my trailer. She also happens to be over 21. Well, so am I. I pay for it, anyway. All right, you ass, you wanna turn to the right. No, no, stupid. The wheel to the right. Jesus, what've I got working for me? Bimbo! Hey, try it yourself, Flo. [MEN CHATTERING] Okay, come on, try again, stupid. Isn't that the same limousine that was outside the diner? Oh, God, nuts with this. Get them. Let's get out of here. Hey, hey, watch it. Hey, knock it off, I don't need any help. We missed.Really? Will you get out of that tree? Come on down, come on. Come on. You go back to Flo. Move it! [HONKING] What the hell is going on? All right, all right, okay. Hold it, hold it. Will you stop hitting me? [BLOWING WHISTLE] Knock it off! Stop playing around and get back to work, you yoyos. Come on, come on. Hey, where's my hat? Hey, where are you two flakes going? I got dibs on the Mercedes. Will you stop helping me? What do you think I am, a baby? Well, in some ways, yes. Yeah, well, didn't you see me take care of myself back there? Do you think I need help after that? Yeah. Come on, everybody, out of the car, nice and quiet. All right, get out. Line up, line up right here. Come on, walk out, speed up. Line it up. Take the glasses off. Hey, Leone. Galliani, Tartaglia. Falcone. Hey, Sal, what are you doing associating with known criminals? Pinotti, that's a major violation of your parole. What the hell is going on here? Who are you? I'm their lawyer. How'd you get here so fast? They didn't have time to call you. Well, this is my house, you jerk. Then why were they here? Uh, well... Here's the Union Pension books, Daddy. Officer. Officer, if you ask him and him and that big guy in the black coat there, they'll be able to tell you where the body of Willie Bighums is. All right, everybody on your face. Hands out in front of you. Come on, let's pop that Mercedes. FINCH: Now you two, I'm a member of the Bar. FLO: That's all the more raisin on your face, Finch. Hey, listen, I gotta know something. What do you want out of me? Nothing. You don't want to change me? Not one tiny bit. You don't want to jump all over my bones? Well, I've thought about it, yeah. Yeah? You're just not my type. Then why'd you give me these papers? Your whole life. I think you deserve it. Deserve it? Yeah. I think you're terrific. You really do, really? Really. You love me. Yep. You're the best thing to come along in my life so far. Oh, you bet your ass I am. So that's why. You love me, you love me. You love me, you love me, you love me, you love me. Oh, I've never made such a bundle on one job in my whole life. How would you like to go to New York? I hate New York. How do you know, you've never been there? I've seen it. Where? TV. Ahhh, go on. They've got good colleges back there. College? I told you I didn't want to have anything to do with college. Geez, I didn't even graduate high school. Listen, you'll take an equivalency test, you'll pass. You're very smart. Hey, isn't that somebody inside your car? Gloria, you witch. Come back here. Mike, look at this. She stole my car. Did you see? She stole... Oh, forget that flake. Climb in, partner. I always knew I'd find this car some day, just like I always knew I'd find you. Where are we going? New York. Why? Why not? I'll never understand you. Don't try.
