If Shao-hua didn't have such a father... I might never have met a writer called Shen Shao-hua Shao-hual! Shao-hual! Come down! Let her out! Shao-hual! How cruel can a father be! Shao-hual! Shao-hual! Shao-hual! Shao-hual! Shao-hual! I'll be back! Wait for me! De orchid, also called “white-jade”, or “yearning-for-spring”... ...since its flowers are pure as jade, fragrant as orchids. De orchid, also called “white-jade”, or “yearning-for-spring”... ...since its flowers are pure as jade, fragrant as orchids. You needn't look down upon me! When I'm rich, I'll be back for your daughter! ...since its flowers are pure as jade, fragrant as orchids... Let me out! Father, let me out! Miss, please eat something Go, find mother... Master, she tries to kill herself! How stupid! She won't die! Leave her alone! Boyfriends wasn't the only reason why she was locked up. In one of her articles, Shao-hua wrote... ...Her mother never loved her father. When she died, he dumped his frustrations and hatred... ...on their daughter. Miss, you can get out now! Your father has died! Go take a look! “Jade Orchid stood at the master's backdoor, waiting to be called.” “With her parents dead, her uncle sold her to be a bond servant.” “Japanese propaganda covered the walls. But she couldn't read.” “Not long after she arrived...” “...her master raped her.” Does writer Shen Shao -hua live here? Writer? You mean the new tenant upstairs? Is she a writer? Yes, she's quite a character! Always playing her records really loud. Follow me. Thanks. Come in. This is her room. Go in. It's alright. What is it? A letter for me? Come in Afraid I'll bite you? Bring it over. Miss Shen. Wait... Thanks. “Jade Orchid was pregnant. When her mistress found out” “...she took her revenge on the girl.” Mr. Chang, need this for self-defense? Who are you looking for? Miss Shen upstairs? You've a visitor. A man to see you! Who is it? Miss Shen, you must have received my letter. My driver brought it two days ago Letter? Such fine handwriting... I don't mind meeting him Mr. Chang I am one of your readers. Please sit down My landlady's sitting room. We can stay awhile. Why do you want to see me? I read one of your articles Just can't get it out of my mind. At night I wrote a letter, to a woman writer, a stranger. It's embarrassing. I thought: she is such a fine writer. Without the right background, she couldn't have this disposition. Aren't you too generous to tip my driver with this? I am not good with money. Actually, I know about your father. He was general manager of Mobil Oil Company. My father is dead. My stepmother doesn't like me. I've nothing to do with my family now. Like being on your own? I'm used to it. There is a war on anyway. May I come again in a few days”? Yes. Then can I go now? It's cold. Keep yourself warm. I brought you a toy. When I was a child, my mother gave me one just like it. How are you know? From your articles. “I'm Jade Orchid. Who are you?” “Spring Hope.” Let me have some candied apples. Here. Give me four sticks. Thank you. Look out! Hold these! It's so cold. Even the ground is going to crack open. Get up. We've a guest. Old Ku, you're at home? Have some peanuts. Go out. Enjoy yourself. Don't just read all day. I must edit those articles. Finished your piece? Is it long or short? Short. Thought you needed money. Why not make it long? I can. But you'll have to pay more. Don't talk about money. We're friends. Can't you see we're poor? I still want to be paid more. Give me a long article then. Alright. But that man is still taking a bath. Who is taking a bath? Crazy! Women! A hot water flask for your new apartment. Pay me more! Take this cup too! Pay me more! Take this egg! Pay me more! Take this banana! I insist! More, more, more! So inconsiderate! Take these magazines too. Can't sell them anyway. What a friend! Take after the boy. Don't just read the newspapers. Goodbye. I'm going for a walk. You"re old enough to look after yourself. I've to use the toilet. Don't mess up my things! Don't use this envelope anymore. Have you met him yet? No. It's me who gave him your address. If you're nice, you call him a cultural attache. If you're nasty, you call him a collaborator! Want some? It's hot. If Old Ku weren't his classmate, I wouldn't tolerate him. You're clean. Stay away from him. Honestly, you haven't gone out with him? No. Just don't, remember? I remember. Mr. Chang, stay for dinner. Let's go to a restaurant. Alright. Please wait for me outside. Close the door. Hide these! Don't let anyone see you. It's dangerous. You want to die? If he goes to the police, we're dead. What you wrote about your family, is it true? Yes. I feel sorry for your mother. She fell in love while studying abroad... but had to come home for an arranged marriage. How tragic! Ever since I can remember, I've never seen her smile. She was just over 30 when she died. My father didn't even shed a tear. He hated her. What are you looking at? Your shaw! It's pretty. Excuse me... These days, I can't listen to this music either. It always makes me sad. I work for the Japanese... You probably know. Ever killed any Chinese? No. My uncle is Japanese. He worked in China as a teacher. Before he died, he arranged this job for me. It's just an excuse. Those who drift with the tide... ...will come to a bad end. Your wife is also Japanese? No, we've separated. No children, so it wasn't painful. Here we are, Mr. Chang. Traitor! Damn you! Use the side gate! Don't fall! What do you want? Baby, don't cry... Kill me! Think that will save China? What's the use of telling us this? Run! Get away! Pick it up! Stab me here! Want me to do it myself? I won't even feel the pain. I don't want to see both of you again. Take this money to move somewhere else. What's left is for the kid. Life is hard for all of us. When I'm not around anymore, take care of Miss Shen. What is it? Nothing. If they had killed you... I wouldn't want to live. Be prepared... ...may disappear anytime. There's something else... I'm embarrassed to give it to you. I put it on the water-tank in the bathroom, This is headquarters of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Manchoukuo is the base of this holy war for a Pan-Asia. To support our plans fo a new order, we address... ...the political, military, security, commercial... Transport, farming and labour sectors... to carry out our vigorous preparation work. Like it? But you said you'll disappear. Do you love me? I'm here. Fool, you fool... “Jade Orchild, I've asked you many times.” “Have you decided?” “They'll never let me go.” “Never mind them. Run away with me.” “The master raped me.” “I was pregnant. Do you still want me?” It's me! Me, Yueh-feng! I got your letter and came rightaway. Stupid girl! Ran away with a man to join the resistance. Not a word all these years. I'm a romantic. With love, who needs to write? Men can come and go. But I always carry your photo. At least you remember me. No, just too lazy to change it. Silly! Did you graduate? Am I the studious type? I followed him around... ...performing street theatre. “Hey, put down your whip!” Nice place. I still remember this. Do I see romance on your face? Crazy! Tell me the truth! Take off your shoes. Big slippers! Well, well!... Where is he? We're through. He must still be with the resistance. Did you leave him? He only cares about saving China. One day, I couldn't stand it. asked, “What's more important: China or me?” He refused to say. I wouldn't let him sleep... l pinched him, pushed him. Finally, he said, “china.” I said,”Without love, how can you save China?” I slapped him and left. What is so funny? That you slapped him! Silly! Felt better after that? Neng-tsai, my best friend Yueh-feng is back. Of course you can come. I want her to know about us. Isn't he Hsiao-chien? My first boyfriend? Didn't even invite me to his wedding! And a father soon! I almost killed myself because of him! Lucky I didn't die! Save China! What about saving me? Dame it! He has no feelings! But I still love him. A dog must have eaten his heart! For a woman, does her heart control her body? What do you mean? Did you and Hsiao-yung... What about you and “Big Slipper”? Are we slaves to our emotions? I am. But men aren't. You're sure? Of course. Men just aren't human! Sure I won't be electrocuted”? You want to be pretty? Because of your boyfriend. You"re doing this for him? For my best friend's lover! What's so funny? Don't worry. You"ll look good with a perm. What happened? I look like my mother! I can't see anyone! Don't worry. You're back, Mr. Yu? Yes. Did a lot of business? Yes. I'll use the iron. Will it work? No problem. Just a bit longer. Be careful! It's so hot! Be patient. There is a man at the door! Where? I'm sorry. Miss Shen, try these tongs. Clip them on and you'll get nice curls. But I've just straightened them! Who's he? A travelling trader. Lives next-door. Miss Shen... What is it? Nothing... He's a bit strange. Let's finish it. Isn't it fine now? Let's go What are you worried about? Miss Shen. Take this silk to make a dress. Now, with this war... ...Silk is hard to find... But I'll do anything to get what you like. That's it! If not for this war, we'd be leading a normal life. Wouldn't that be nice? Have some chestnuts I wish we were born 10 years later. Ours is an unfortunate generation! We"re like a family. Let's go to eat. I've ordered a banguet. Good, we'll eat till you're broke. The weather is like fate, so changeable. Isn't it? Wait! Do you have a special pass? Sorry. Thanks. You can go. I'm not going. I don't feel well. The ride will do you good. I said I'm not going! Can I telephone from the office? I need to cancel our reservation. Look at me, who is this man? Tell me! He's my lover He's the man with the whip! Our time has arrived. Neng-tsai, are you hurt? Yueh-feng, I've no blood on my hands. Being locked up made me a writer. If only we met earlier... may be I'd be someone else. You make me feel secure, give me a feeling of home. I only gave you a paper tiger. I am happy enough. Who really are you? Why did we meet? Are women so easily fooled? Men are just the same. You had a plan? You fell for it! You had it all planned? I'll buy you a paper tiger everyday. Did you really plan this? Call me a schemer, alright? Let me kiss your ear. Shall we dance? Alright. Let's get married. What I do will hurt you. The fortune-teller's predictions on my life are in here. Keep it. I don't have much to give you. Just remember this moment for the rest of our lives. Are you tired? Hungry? Miss Shen! We speak outside. I was your neighbour, remember? Please help my husband. The Japanese took him away. Said he's in the resistance. It's not true! Please help him! Miss Shen... Get up. Only your friend can help him. Please help us. Child, kneel down. - Auntie, please help my dad. - Miss Shen! Go home first. Miss Shen... It's your lover who turned my husband in! Neng-tsai, you can't come here again. That night, I left Shao-hua. When would we meet again? I didn't dare to think. I missed her so much. Come to think of it. ...I've never told her I loved her. Japan surrendered. China suffered heavy casualities. Soon after, civil war broke out. This time, the Chinese are fighting each other. The Nationalists against the Communists. As for me, I was someone without a future. Yueh-feng, you're back? I'm back, because he's gone. He's the second man in your life to leave you. But I still love him. Be careful. We women must be careful. Come back...Shao-hua... Shao-hua...Come back... Come back...Shao-hua... Shao-hua...Come back... Come back...Shao-hua... Miss Shen, where is Cheng Neng-tsai hiding? He killed my husband! He must die for it! Miss Shen, here I come! Hooligans! Go away! If she doesn't turn him in, we'll be back everyday. Don't catch cold. Are the beans fresh? Yes. Shao-hua, you're here. Don't worry. I wasn't followed. I don't mean that. My landlady. She does my cooking and laundry. She takes care of me. I didn't ask. Let's buy some cloth. How much for one foot of cloth? You need at least 8 feet for a short-sleeve dress. Don't worry. I'll give you a good price. How much should I cut? We'll come back. Never mind. I want a thimble and some red thread. They're hard to find in the city. Get them for me. How long will you stay? I've moved all my things here. It's late. Where are you going? I'll be at my brother's for a few days. You fool! How can you say the same thing to her? What did I say? “You fool!” You always say this when you hold me in your arms. What does it matter? She is only my landlady. Did you tell her the same about me? No. She's nothing compared to you. Do you know why I am here? Because I love you. But since I arrived, you've said nothing about love. You call me unfair. ...and compare me with other women. I love only you... But there are other women in your life. Shao-hual! I don't need you or anyone else to shelter me from the rain! Shao-hual! “Jade Orchid fell ill. She and Spring Hope finally married.” “He took her home, to be looked after by his mother.” “Then he joined the army.” He said: "Men must die for their country.” She said, “1I'll always be your wife while I'm alive...” “...When I'm dead.” Are you wet? I'm going to the meeting. Open your mouth. A dog must have eaten his heart. American TV shooting in China reports that... ...the Chinese dollar is on the verge of collapse. Inflation is... ...rising by the hour. A silver dollar used to be 80,000 gold yuan. Now, the exchange rate is over 1 million. Except gold and silver, all currencies are worthless... On January 17, 1949, unconfirmed rumours say... ...people were allowed to exchange money for gold in 4 banks... And half the blackmarket rate. On the first day, 7 people were trampled to death... ...and the rumours were quickly suppressed. Come in Aren't you going to greet her? Mother-in-law! Crazy! From now on, the three of us will always be together. About saving China, I'll let you get on with it. Think he came back for me? No, for the student movement. Let's eat. I told him, “before you throw yourself into your work.” “exchange this bag of rubbish for a bedsheet...” Bedsheet? Are you getting married? No! We'll put a nail here, a nail there. Hang up the sheet. And divide this room into two. To keep you away from us! Stay home. Don't get into trouble. He asked me to go. Stay here. He wanted me to go. Are these anti-government meetings dangerous? Of course. When a woman is in love... ...nothing is more dangerous. Don't you agree? Whatever happens is our own doing. Yueh-feng. Shao-hual! Is Yueh-feng dead? Sit down. Is she dead? Yes. How did she die? The school was surrounded. The students tried to break out. And the police opened fire. There's nothing there anymore. I've to look for her. I told you to stay out trouble. You can't come back now. Is it worth it? Not coming back isn't important. We'll stay here forever. But you're so young. This is what we wanted. I am devoted to his ideals I am devoted to him Old man, whose skin & bone are you washing away? “My husband is dead.” Mr. Yu. How can I leave you? Look, there are beggars everywhere. Without you, I'd be like them. Miss Shen, don't say that. It makes me feel bad. Why should you feel bad? Don't slurp your soup! It makes me feel bad. What does it matter? Not to you, but to me. Looking at you! Eating like a pig! You... Where are you going? To piss. Sit down! You must finish your dinner. Or I'm going to feel bad again. Miss Shen, things are getting desperate. Listen to the guns! The Communists will be here soon. I do business with the Nationalist army. What will happen to me? Get out! Get out! Sit down! Miss, buy this piano . Just give me some biscuits for it. Take the sofa too. My family is starving. Minister Chang, how have you been? How much does it cost to eat there now? Nothing is the same anymore. What has become of you? Where are you going? At least I'm still alive. You first words are still about yourself. Ever think about Yueh-feng and me? How did we stay alive? Yueh-feng didn't stay alive. She's dead. I cleaned her body, changed her clothes... I filled thousands of bullet holes in her body... one by one...with cotton. I dug her grave with my hands. Where were you then? Shao-hua, come with me. It's too late. There's no faith left in me anymore. Give me another chance. In the past, I just drifted along. After I lost you, life became so empty. Why didn't you say this before? Let's start all over again! I love you. ...love... you. Aren't you Miss Shen? What do you do? Teacher. What kind of teacher? Primary school teacher. Traitor. Walk. Don't look at her. Nobody cares about traitors now. Communist! Get him! Get him, he's a Communist! He killed my husband. He's a Communist! Freeze! Bitch! You seduced my husband! Now you try to frame him! I'll take your clothes off! You bitch! Who will take her clothes off? Don't let me see her again! Or I'll really do it! Shao-hua, the old society is almost over. Writers like us are out of fashion. Especially you. Your father was a comprador. Your ex-lover worked for the Japanese. Your novels are full of the footprints of the exploiting class. Shao-hua, reflect on your situation carefully Times are changing. I won't write anymore. Thank you. This is for the children Here he is again. Let's go inside. Miss Shen. I know there is... ...a boat, the last one. It's for the Nationalist officials and their families. I spent a lot of gold to buy two tickets. I--- I've always liked you. I know you're too good for me. But these are difficult times. After leaving China, we can... Afterall, we've gone through some rough time together, haven't we? Please come with me. Miss, I've no ticket. Take my baby. It's a boy. A healthy boy. Please help him stay alive. Missus, I beg you. Miss Shen. You"re mistaken. Sorry. How many people in your group? Two. Me and my girlfriend. You came separately? She won't make it. The road here is full of wounded soldiers and thugs. A woman alone won't make it. Everyone is looking for tickets. Don't waste yours. Sell it to me. I'll pay in gold. I don't want to go. Your mother's grave is here. I want to stay with her. Father, we slept here for a week to buy the tickets. If we leave, When will we be back? Will you miss this place? Yes. In a year or two, When things settle down, we'll come back. They may put me in jail, but I won't mind. I'll wait. Just do one thing when you get out. What? Give me a home. Let me take your photo. All aboard! Let me off! I've to look for my girlfriend! It's a trick! The soldiers are getting on the boat! There won't be enough places for us! Don't close the door! Shao-hual! - Shao-hua - Neng-tsai Neng-tsai! Shao-hual! Neng-tsai! Run! The boat is just ahead! If we're separated, don't come back for me. I'll see you on the boat! Let me on. I've a ticket! Those without tickets, go away! Hold on to your ticket! We've tickets! Get them over here! Here! Shao-hual! Shao-hual! Shao-hual! Shao-hual! Shao-hual! Shao-hual! Shao-hual! Shao-hual! Shao-hual! Shao-hual! Miss Shen... Mr Yu, I'm sorry. It's alright. I'm not afraid to die. We lived through the Japanese occupation. Surely we can survive under our own government. I only want to take care of you. I want nothing else. Don't be sad. In a few years, when things calm down, ...Mr Chang will come back for you. I won't mind. Don't worry, nothing will happen to us. Many years later, I finally got news of Shao-hua. After years of poverty and self-exile... No-one asks about my past anymore. When the political situation has relaxed I returned to the place that has haunted me... ...to find the person who has haunted me. Mr Chang, our superior is waiting How are you? Please come in. As requested in your letter, we've found the dossier on Shen Shao-hua. Just a minute. Comrade, I want to apply for residence. We've heard of Shen Shao-hua. She was quite well-known. But not because of her books. Just before liberation, she was saved from drowning. ...by the first PLA soldier entering the city. When she woke up & saw the red star on the soldier's cap, he said,”I'm glad to be alive...” “...or I'd never see new China.” This is Shen Shao-hua, you can look at it. This is one of her novels... It was published after liberation. You can't buy it now. If you want it, take my copy. “White Jade Orchid” “When Jade Orchid heard Spring Hope had died fighting,” “she tried to drown herself in the river.” “A young man from the next village rescued her.' “She stayed with him.” “But all her life, she hated him for saving her.” “In spite of that, they had a child.” “They brought the baby to register her birth.” People asked,”"What is her name?” Jade Orchid said, "The night she was born, there was...” “a bright moon. I'll call her Yueh-feng (moon phoenix).” I thought Shao-hua would grow old & die. I never thought she would die in another turmoil. She died in my place. In her darkest moments, she was all alone. Maybe her only consolation was... the whole nation was also suffering with her.
