FORTUNE 5 water? FORTUNE 5 water? Enjoy. Excuse me. Uh, do you realize that you're sitting in an exit row? - Yes. - Yes. And do you accept the responsibility of assisting others in the event of an emergency? - Yes. - Yes. Thank you. Enjoy your flight. - Thank you. - Thanks. You have kids? Yes. I have a son. You? No. None yet. I'm a little old school. Prefer to be settled down, married first. That's nice. My parents, they stayed married until, well, I had a pretty good childhood for the most part. Excuse me. Hi, baby. Hey, we're about to take off. I love you. Tell your dad I said I love him. Okay, I love you, too. When you get home can we- - Let's talk about this later, okay? No family's perfect, though. Attention, passengers. We're experiencing a bit of turbulence here at takeoff. All personal items should remain stowed beneath the seat in front of you. We expect the turbulence to subside in a few minutes and we should have a smooth flight the rest of the way. Current local temperature in Atlanta is 74 degrees. Oh, god. Good afternoon, flight 238 passengers. We are experiencing unexpected mechanical problems. We're getting a signal the planes engine's failing to communicate properly with the fuel line. We'll be making an emergency landing. I'm here for you. You're gonna be okay. We're all gonna be okay. My name's Clint, okay? Thank you for calling the Airways Air emergency contact line. Flight 238 is currently making an emergency landing. Please hold. Oh, God dammit! Why is she on that plane? May I ask your name, please? My name is Sasha. Sasha Dade. Thanks. Sasha. You okay? I'm so happy you're here. ♪ I see you ♪ ♪ Over there ♪ ♪ I wonder ♪ ♪ Would you care ♪ ♪ If I called you sometime ♪ Make a baby? I hope so. I don't wanna lose anymore. I'm not getting any younger. Oh, baby. You're so beautiful. If we didn't, I'm gonna keep making all this good love to you till we do. Promise? Of course. Which reminds me. I want you, I want you to go see your doctor and get a checkup, okay? That whole thing was pretty scary. I know. I'll see Dr. Rhand next week. I just wanna spend some time with BJ today. Okay. Mmm. Well, well, look who's already up and ready for school. When did you start making your own breakfast? I knew you'd be tired from your trip, so I thought I should be a little more grown up today and do it myself. It looks like you did a fantastic job. Maybe you can do this with cleaning your room, too? Maybe at least once a week? - Oh. - Hi. As soon as you're done, I'll take you to school. Uh, great. Thanks, Mom. You sure? You wanna stay home and get some rest? Yeah, I'm sure. I'll take him. Okay. There you are. - Mom, are you okay? - Yes. Who's this idiot behind me that can't wait? I'm droppin' off my son! But Mom, we have been here for a minute. BJ, don't talk to me like that. I'm your mother, okay? Yes. I'm sorry, Mom. Get in there. All right. Lookin' good. Let's see, 150. Sasha, I heard about the plane being diverted. Now, this can be a very scary ordeal. It is normal to have feelings of anxiety after a scare like that. So, you know if you need to talk, you can talk to me. All right? And if you need some rest, make sure you get it. Now the body is amazing that it will protect itself from trauma, but it doesn't mean you have experienced trauma. - Thanks, Dr. Rhand. - Mmm, okay. Now I wanna ask you a couple questions. Have you been having any problems eating or sleeping? No. I feel just fine. Okay. Do you have any feelings of anxiety? No. I'm not more worried about anything. Okay. Do you have any feelings of fear or loss? For example, being only concerned with your family, with Bryce Sr., Jr., or anyone else that's close to you. Not at all. Bryce Sr.'s been amazing. He was there to pick me up and we've been talking constantly. I feel very safe and secure. Oh. Okay. Well, you look good. Everything is well. Blood pressure is good. Your heart rate is normal. Now I am concerned though with the muscle tension along your neck and your shoulders. Okay, so what I wanna do is prescribe a muscle relaxer for you for 30 days, okay? All right, now only use this if you have to. And if you're beginning to feel that muscle tension after 30 days, make sure you call me and we'll set up an appointment. But I don't see any reason why you would need anxiety medication. Okay. Thank you so much, Dr. Rhand. I really do feel great. Good. I'm just thankful the incident wasn't more serious. Absolutely. Now, are you going to work anytime soon? Yes, headed to the office now. Well, I don't see any reason why you can't go back to your normal routine. Okay. All right? But again, if you feel any changes, give me a call to make an appointment, all right? I will. Thank you so much, Dr. Rhand. You're welcome. - Have a wonderful day. - Be safe. You, too. Hey, hey, Sasha! Welcome back. Hey, Doug. I heard you skipped a flight. Because the on board advertising sucked? Thanks, Doug. If that were the case, there wouldn't be any planes that get off the ground. Seriously though. If you'd been hurt, I would've been down there, kicking some Airways Air's ass. Thankfully the entire ordeal was without incident. I'm fine, really. Plus, you can't afford to get arrested again. I need you on this pitch. That wasn't my fault. She tried to take my dog. I mean, we were broken up, but the dog was mine. I need a best friend, too. Where's Emily? - Drinking. - What? Why is she drinking? She's a little nervous she might get fired. - Fired for what? - Drinking. Can you text her and let her know I wanna meet at 2:00pm to see where we are with the pitch? Mmm-hmm. Emily, Sasha's back. She wants to meet at 2:00pm. Don't worry. You're not fired today. Done. Thank you. Hi there. This seat taken? - Uh, no. - Good. My name's Clint. What's yours? Mikhela. Hi, Mikhela. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. So what brings you in here today? Uh, it's been a long day. Just getting food after work. Hmm. Can I make a recommendation? Sure. Try the mango smoothie. It's not too hot, not too cold. Just right, like you. Well, thank you. Come on, Dad! Mom is winning! Yeah, Mom! Go, Mom! That's right, BJ! I got this! Who's your momma? Yeah, boy, who's your daddy? Stop it, Bryce! It's no fair. Mom, get the controller! Dad's catching up! Whoa, whoa, whoa! - Make Daddy pay, BJ. - Whoa, whoa. All right, finish him off. Then it's lights out for you. It's almost time for bed. - You said it, Mom. - Mmm. Fuck! "Dear Sasha Dade. We are a nonprofit organization in Washington D.C. and we need your help with an advertising campaign to help us create awareness of our mission. We provide services to keep at-risk families together so that innocent children will not end up in foster care when their parents face unexpected financial hardships that could force them into homelessness. We understand your agency is a for-profit company and this type of work may be unusual, but we need you. We believe you, specifically, would be the best person to lead this campaign, giving your commitment to a family as a wife and mother of a young son, and your track record of success as an executive. If we don't gain more attention soon, we risk losing funding, and as a result we'll no longer be able to help the people who need it most." Wow. Interesting. They know so much about me. They must've read my bio and they want me specifically. Okay. Yes. More. More. Yes. Yes. Mmm. Sasha. Mmm. Hi, Doug. It's Sasha. I just saw a cancellation for a meeting this afternoon. Any reason why? Oh. Hi, Sasha. I thought you were gone. I went to lunch earlier and your car wasn't there, so I just thought you left. No, I've been here all day. Oh, I am so sorry. I should've confirmed. I'll get it back on your calender and I'll be in your office in a few minutes. Okay, thanks, Doug. I appreciate it. Oh, listen. We're bringing on a new account. I wanna talk more about it this afternoon when we meet. Perfect. Why would he think? ♪ Just my imagination ♪ ♪ Runnin' away with me ♪ ♪ It's just my imagination ♪ ♪ Runnin' away ♪ Mikhela? Sweetheart? What the fuck? Bryce, how could you? We're tryin' to make a baby! Why would you do this? I've been doing everything I could for us and our family, and now this? I've loved you without a doubt from the beginning! And I will not be put through this! Not now, not ever! I will not be played for a fool. I don't believe this. No, no. I can't do it. Please. Somebody help me. Sasha. Sash? - Let go, let go! - Sasha. He's gonna help me serve. Sash. Shh. Don't push me away. Don't push me away. Shh. Sash? - Keep me safe. - Sash. Are we gonna live? Sash, Sash? - Oh! - Shh. Shh. Sasha. It's me, it's Bryce. BJ's in the other room. Oh! You're in here with me, baby, okay? Relax. It's gonna be. Shh. So when I was about eight years old, we, well, my parents and two older brothers and I, we were just coming back into town from a family vacation. We pulled into the garage and bam! A mouse dropped down from the top of the garage. My mom was petrified. My dad was tryin' to console her, and my brothers and I, we thought it was hilarious. We could not contain our laughter. My dad started getting pissed because the more we laughed, the more upset Mom got. So he told us, well, why don't you stay in the garage all night? Well, we did. My brothers and I stayed in there, tried to catch that mouse the whole night. We were foolin' around and eventually they fell asleep, but I didn't. I was determined to catch that mouse. I even put on headphones to listen to music so I could stay up and the mouse wouldn't hear me. Come to think of it, I think that's the quietest and most still I'd ever been in my entire life. Finally, I, I saw the mouse. Peeked his head out under a bench, and that's when I made my move. Slowly. Quietly. So slow. So quiet. So slow. So quietly. And bam! Jabbed it with the front end of a hoe, killing it in just that one strike. It startled my brothers, too. They woke up and were pissed because I'm the one who killed the mouse, so I got the bragging rights. I think that was when I realized the excitement of fear. You like it, right? Uh, yeah. Yeah, I love it. Relax, baby, relax. You're with me. Sleep tight, princess. Now why do you, as an animal, think you have the right of way? Really? An animal, trying to cross the street in the middle of the night. Hey, Clint. What do you call a dog trying to cross the street in the middle of the night? A dead dog, that's what. I didn't mean to hit you. You kind of just got in the way. I wanted to let you go by. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I guess this is a beginning and end for both of us, huh? Now this is a house that was recently sold to a beautiful couple. It's a really beautiful house. Yeah, great neighborhood, too. Safe at night. Oh, this is really nice out front. I'm gonna take a picture for my husband. - Oh, sure we can. - Thank you. Oh! I love it! Nice garage. Yes, I'm in love with this house. Do me a favor. Send me a copy of those pictures if you can. Of course. No problem. BJ, that's enough. BJ, I said that's enough! But Mom, I have to keep practicing to get better. No, you don't. It is good enough. I do not wanna hear that song anymore right now. Just get in the house and get ready for bed! It's a good song and you liked it. Sash, why'd you get so upset at BJ today? I love that boy like he's my own, all right? That's why we gave him my name. Listen. We can't go on like this. Well, if you don't want it to go on like this, get rid of Mikhela. What? Who is Mikhela? Who is Mikhela, Bryce? Oh, I can't believe this. I found a jewelry store card in my car that had Mikhela and sweetheart written on it! You wanna give someone a ring? You wanna buy someone else a ring? You don't have to do that. Have mine! What the hell are you talkin' about? I don't know anyone named Mikhela! Sasha, I'm not leaving you! And I don't know where that jewelry store card came from! I promise you, baby! God damn! I told you the day you leave this house to be with another woman, this marriage is over. I feel like I don't even know you right now. It's like I'm talkin' to someone who's thinkin', you're not hearin' anything I'm saying! What do you want me to say? That it's okay as long as you're home fucking me tonight? I'm your wife! I come, I always come first! Always! Well, what do you think, babe? Would you like to live in a neighborhood like this? Babe, you. Look at me, motherfucker. Who the fuck are you? Oh my God! Look at me. You got some business with my wife or somethin'? I will blow your head off, motherfucker. Would you mind putting down your fucking gun, please? My fiance and I are looking for a new home. I noticed how nice yours is, so I slowed down. It's not for sale. Sorry to disturb you. You wanna talk about last night? You ready to be honest with me? Sasha, I was honest with you. I don't know where that jewelry store card came from. Bryce, I'm finding that hard to believe right now. I need some space tonight. Just leave, okay? You really want me to leave my own house? You want me to leave you and BJ over this? Okay. I'll give you your space. Kiss my son goodnight for me. Bryce, I asked for one night apart. Please go. Damn. You haven't had to crash at my place in 20 years. What did you do? Nothin'. Honestly. Sasha don't believe me. I just need to crash for one night, man. Goodnight, sweetheart. - Ah! The light! - BJ! Sorry, Mom. Do you know how many kids don't have, ugh. Dammit, just go to sleep! Bryce, you said for better or worse. You just let me tell you go and you went! You're my husband! You're supposed to fight harder for me! You're supposed to fight harder! It's like what I'm feeling, like what I'm feeling. I need. Hey, Dirtyman. Thanks for everything, man. I gotta go home. I know this is crazy. Just hope she's had enough time to cool off. Later, homie. Sasha? Sasha! Sasha! Sasha! Sasha. Sasha. Sasha, wake up, baby. Sash, wake up for me, baby. Oh, shit. BJ? BJ! Let's go. Mr. Dade. Good evening. I'm Dr. Scott. Good evening, Dr. Scott. I want to let you know that your wife is going to be fine. We've run some tests. We found that she's had a combination of alcohol and muscle relaxants and over-the-counter anxiety medication, and we'll be talking to her in the morning when she is a little better rested. But she is doing fine and if you want to visit her. Thank you, Dr. Scott. Um, by the way, I see that your wife, she is a patient of Dr. Rhand. Yes, yes, she is. I, uh, encouraged her to visit and talk about things and get checkups, you know. Good. Yes, he, um, he's an excellent physician. I know him well. And you know, if you need anything, please get me paged and don't hesitate to contact me. - Thank you, sir. - Okay. Hey, Sash. Bryce. Hey, baby. I don't wanna lose you. Babe, I'm not goin' anywhere. I love you. I love you, too. What did the doctor say? He said you're gonna be fine. He said it was a combination of the anxiety pills and the alcohol and the muscle relaxers. Sasha, I didn't know you were taking anxiety medication. It was very scary to find you like that. It was mild. I thought it would help me relax a little. I should've told you. Hey, you can tell me anything. I'm your husband. I'm never leaving you and BJ like that again. It's not me, Sash. It's not why I married you. I'm just glad I came home when I did. You really left? I thought I kept hearing you. Shh. Just rest, baby. I'll see you in the morning. I love you. All right, champ. It's time to go. BJ? Come on, buddy. You got school in the morning. Hi, Sasha. I'm so sorry you ended up here. But I'm here for you. Just like before, remember? It was just you and me. There were others, but it was really just you and me. It's perfect this way, don't you think, Sasha? Just imagine all the things we can be and do together. I know you'll believe me. You just have to see it my way. Bryce? Yes, Sasha? Bryce. No. No! Sasha, calm down. Get away from me! Somebody help me! Bryce! Nurse! Did you see him? Where'd he go? Ms. Dade, you're all right. I want my husband! Bryce! So have you always struggled to communicate with one another or is this a new occurrence in your marriage? No, Bryce and I have always been open and honest with one another. So what has changed, if anything? I, I don't know. I feel like I've been there for her, like I always have, but lately, especially since the airplane incident, I feel like I barely exist to her. Airplane incident? What happened? Sasha had a business trip a few months ago and the flight had an emergency landing. It was scary for her. I mean, it was scary for me, but I was there at the airport when the airplane finally landed. I was there, you know? I held her close to me to make sure she was safe. I was there. You were. I love you. I just feel like even though I've been there by your side, you keep pushing me away. Sometimes you let me make love to you, sometimes I can barely touch you. Sasha, how do you feel about what Bryce is expressing? He's right. I mean, sometimes I guess I need a little space. I know he's there, but I just miss the connection sometimes. One night I was a little stressed, maybe a little anxious, I think I was having a nightmare and Bryce was right there to hold me. It was some nightmare. Sasha, did you have these nightmares before the airplane incident? No, not that I recall. I mean, work can be a little stressful at times, so occasionally some nights I get a little less sleep. I mean, Bryce, have I had problems sleeping before? No, babe, not like this. And the way you fought me off, I thought you was thinking about somebody else. Me thinking of someone else? That's what I was thinkin'. All right you two, stand up. I have an exercise. I want you to face each other and stare into each other's eyes for at least 30 seconds and try to get to three minutes. I can't. I can't do this. Sasha, yes, you can. Sasha, you need to trust him, and you need to trust yourself enough to trust him. Okay, we're gonna try this again on the count of three. One, two, three. ♪ Yeah, yeah ♪ ♪ Yeah ♪ Okay, Sasha. It's clear that your trust in Bryce has been broken. Your work starts here. Rebuilding trust. And whenever the two of you are about to have a difficult conversation, I want you to stop and do this exercise before you continue with the discussion. And Sasha, I need you to go back to your family doctor, discuss a little bit more about your anxieties. For what? I feel fine. - Babe, babe. - Why would I? We can work through this. At least I know it's not another man, right? Of course it's not. I mean, I just didn't know what was going on. You weren't yourself, and recently I noticed a man kept driving around our house slow. Yeah, the other day I pulled a gun on him. I went right up to him and wanted to know who he was. He said his fiance and him were looking at homes and they liked ours. Something didn't feel right about it to me. Crazy things. What? What, Bryce? His fiance reminded me of you. I don't know. Duke. Man, it's so good to see you. Man, of course. Glad you could make it, Duke. Of course, man. This is special. But two months? Get over here. Two months? You ready to get married already really? Wow. It's a little sudden. But it's time now. I mean, she is cute. How do you know she's not after your money? Well, I guess I don't. But she is right next to the very best thing anyone could ever have. Oh, next to? You gotta make sure she's number one. Trust me. Don't settle. It costs too much. Hey, by the way, how's that campaign coming for your aunt's non-profit? Aw, man, it's really going well. I mean, just expose your loan is helping. More kids wanna actually make it out, you know? Like we did, and especially you. I mean, you were lucky enough to get adopted. Man, look at us now. Man, that's so great to hear. Just had a gut feeling that that'll work out. I knew that agency wouldn't disappoint. Yeah, man. Hey, look. Best of luck to you and Mikhela. You know, I'm sorry your mother couldn't be here. I know she would be the judge, but by the look of things, I think she'd approve. Thanks, Duke. All right, Sasha. Take a deep breath. All right, take another deep breath. Excellent, excellent. Your vital signs look very good. Blood pressure, heart rate. Everything looks good. And I see no physical symptoms of anxiety. That's what I knew I'd hear. I really came again because I promised Bryce, Sr. And our family counselor I would. Well, wait a minute. Not so fast. Now you may be experiencing some emotional trauma that was not so easily discerned. Well, what do you mean? I had a few nightmares, but that was it. You overdosed, Sasha. - I did it right- - Now listen, listen. I looked at your file and there's no need for you to be embarrassed. I'm here to help you. Well, I'm doing better. Okay, listen. Healing, it takes time. As a matter of fact, has the airline even come to you for any reassurance? Yes. They refunded my airfare and I received a voucher for a future flight. Okay, good. Well, listen, we're all done here, but if you have any concern, make sure you call me. - Thanks, Doctor. - All right? - I appreciate it. - Okay, you take care. Okay. Oh. Excuse me, miss. Sorry about that. Oh my goodness. Miss, you won't believe this, but the door is jammed. Do you think you can help me when you come out? Hello, is anybody out there? Dr. Rhand, are you there? Ugh! Somebody help me! The door won't open! Somebody help! I'm stuck! Hang on! Hang on! Oh! Sasha! Thank you, Dr. Rhand. I didn't know what happened. The door wouldn't open. It was stuck. Oh, I'm late. I've got a call with a client. I have to go. Sasha, you need to go home and get some rest. Take the next couple of days off or get away for a few days, okay? Come on. Thank you. ♪ How can I deny your love ♪ I'm so glad we came. Thank you. Me, too. Mmm. Mmmm. I got ya. Did we set the alarm before we left? Yeah, we always do. Did you see me set it? No, I didn't see you set it, but I heard the beeps when we left. Stop worryin'. Relax with me. Mmm. Haven't seen you like this in a long time. Mmm-hmm. I like it. - Mmm, you like it? - Mmm-hmm. - Show me. - Mmm. Mom, Dad, can we go back there again soon? That was so much fun. You liked it, right? The kids my age are cool, and they like the same stuff. "I hope you made it home safely?" Bryce. Bryce! What? How did it get here? BJ, BJ, go back to the car. I gotta talk to your mom for a minute, please. How did it get here? What are you talking about? Bryce, this is the luggage tag from the bag I was carrying on the plane. How did it get here? My name and address weren't on it. What? What did the man look like? The man you said that kept driving by our house. What did he look like? You think it was him? What did he look like? Oh, god, I should've shot that motherfucker. What did he look like? Okay, um. Clean cut. Button up shirt-type. He had like a medium build. Brown eyes. I remember that 'cause I didn't like the way his arrogant ass looked at me. No, oh my gosh. I think he was the man from the plane. You gave someone on the airplane our address? No, no. What, did he work for the airline or somethin'? No, Bryce, I didn't give anyone our address, but there was this man, he was sitting next to me in the exit row, and he was helping when the turbulence started and the bags were falling everywhere. I can't remember his name. But I remember he was trying to help me and then I couldn't do anything because I was scared. Oh, shit. Bryce, I'm sorry. I didn't know what to do. I shouldn't have sat there. I just, I didn't know this would happen. Baby, I'm not, I'm not angry with you. This man is sick. Okay? I thought he was there to help me. Oh god, he was there to help me, Bryce! To help me! Hello, is anybody out there? Dr. Rhand, are you there? Somebody help me! The door won't open! Mikhela, is that you? - Somebody help! - Yes, dear. - Help! - Towel, please? Help! Hang on! Hang on! Let me talk to BJ, okay? Okay. Hey, kiddo. You almost ready? Yes. Are you taking me to school? - Yes, I am. - Oh, Mom. Can't I just go to the bus stop? Today's the day my friends and I were going to talk about our video game challenge. I think I'm winning! No. No bus stop today. You guys can talk about that at recess after your music lesson. Your dad and I decided we're gonna be taking you to school and picking you up for awhile, okay? Every day, Mom? And now you act like you can't mind me practicing. You got sick and started taking everything out on me. I'm almost 11 and now I can't even go to the bus stop? BJ, get back in here! Look, your dad and I are very proud of how responsible you've been, but there are some bad people out there. We're just trying to be a little safer right now, okay? Okay. I really can't wait till I'm not the only child anymore. Come on. Let's go. Congratulations. You now have an offer on your dream home. Yes! Thank you, Clint. Thank you, Clint. We're really excited to be at this stage. That's fantastic. And this really is a very nice home. I will call you as soon as I hear back from the seller's agent. Thank you. All right. Aw. Have a good day, okay? Okay. Remember, your dad or I will be here to pick you up. I got it, I got it. Have a good day! Help me! He's after me! Miss, where are you? He's following me! Can you tell me what's happening? It's the man from the plane! Can you speak a little clearer? Help me, please! Hello? Hello? Hello? Answer the phone, answer the phone. Please answer. - Bryce! - Sasha? Bryce, he's here! I see him! I see him! The man from the plane! Excuse me, I need help. Someone's following me. I think I met him before, but I don't really know who he is. He helped me, but now he's after me. Sasha. Detective, Detective. My wife was on a flight a few months ago that had to be diverted due to severe air turbulence. A man, a passenger on this plane tried to keep her calm during the whole ordeal. We believe he developed some kind of obsession with her. Hmm. What my wife is trying to say, too, sir, is if you don't do something to stop this man, I'm going to kill him. Follow me, mister? Dade. My name is Bryce Dade, Sr. This is my wife Sasha. We have a son. Mr. Dade, I understand you want to protect your family, but you can't say you're gonna kill someone in a police station. It's premeditated murder. If you wanna file a complaint or a police report, we could do that. Do you know the name of the person that you believe is stalking you? I don't know his name. I have some recollection of what he looks like, but I don't know his name. Mrs. Dade, we need a name to file a police report or a restraining order. Has he touched you or harmed your property? No, well, sort of. I mean, he came right up to my car after I dropped my son off at school. That's why we're here. I just dropped my son off. Okay, about a week ago we went on vacation. A weekend getaway because I was dealing with anxiety from the plane incident. When we got back home, on the front door there was a luggage tag, the same luggage tag that I had on my bag when I was on the plane. And on the luggage tag there was a note that said, "I hope you made it home safely." Detective, leading up to that, I approached a man who had been driving by my house repeatedly. Said he was a realtor looking for homes, but when I described this man to my wife, she said that he fit the same exact description as the man who was with her on the plane. Yes. Well, I'll admit that's odd, but the way the law works is that unless you have a specific threat against you or a crime is being committed that is punishable by law, there's really nothing we can do. Listen, listen, listen to me. You're not listening to me! I'm listening. I'm registered to carry a gun. I will do what I have to do to protect my wife and my son! Do you understand me? With or without help from the police! You need to calm down. Be careful, Mr. Dade. Stay on the right side of the law. Good day. Follow me to work? Babe, you don't have to go to work. Not with all this on your mind. Just tell them you can't come in. Bryce, I have to go. This non-profit campaign needs me. I'm not gonna let this maniac take over my life. Plus, it's safe at work. Okay. Hey, babe. Hey. I missed you. Beautiful. How was your day? - It was good. - Yeah? Mmm-hmm. So, I saw a listing for an open house happening on Sunday. It's a couple houses down the street. I wanna go. Open house? Okay. I don't want you to go by yourself. I'm comin' with you. Okay. Thank you. Now where were we? Excuse me. Are you the seller's agent? No, he's right over there with that couple. I'm sure he'll be able to speak with you if you wait a few minutes. Thank you. What would you do in a plane crash? Welcome to the open house. I hope I never have to live out an answer to that question. Hi. You have an amazing home. One of the nicest one's on the block. Hey, man. Thanks for covering that open house for me. How'd it go? Sure thing, man. It was good. There was a lot of interest. Think there were over 30 prospects. - Nice. - Got it all right here. Funny, though. I was talking to this couple, and then I turned around to this lady asking what would you do in a plane crash? Hmm? Yeah, I think I said something like hope I never have to find out. Not sure what that has to do with buying a house, but she was gorgeous. Think she was married, though. All right, well, I'm gonna head out. It's all yours. Thanks, Rod. I know you wanna find your way to me, Sasha. I know you want me. I know you need me. What if he'd of been there? What if BJ was with us? I shouldn't have gone. I don't wanna put our family in danger. I can't believe I thought I could just say hi and it would fix it and make him go away. This man is crazy and I almost went to him. Dammit! And the police can't do anything unless he does something first. BJ could've been there and he could've been hurt, all close to home. All I did was get on a plane and I was too scared to help. I shouldn't have traveled. It was a mistake not being here for you and BJ. It's my fault. It's my fault. I can't get the plane out of my head! It won't, baby. All right. BJ can spend the night. I'll pick him up in the morning. Get dressed. Come on. Come on. Bryce? Shh. Just be still, okay? Hold it. Straighten that elbow more. I don't want you to be afraid. You hear me? Of anyone. That's it, baby. That's it. It just takes one shot. Just one shot. Hi, Dr. Rhand. Sasha, how are you? Do we have an appointment today? No, no, we don't. I was just on my way to the office. I just wanted to stop in and let you know how amazing I feel. I'm doing well. I feel like I can take on anything. Fantastic. I can hear it in your voice. So how long have you been here? Not long. Just got here. Hmm. Oddly enough, I think I saw a patient today. Oh, well, at least I assumed he was a patient early on the grounds who had a striking resemblance of you. I have to go. Well? How'd it go? I'm not pregnant. I knew I couldn't have what I want with you. What? Just get dressed and get packed. Hotel check-in's at 3:00pm. But don't you love me? Are you questioning me? Wait, Clint! - Hi, how are you? - Hello. What can I do for you? Here for a reservation. Okay, do you have your ID with you? I do. It's Meyers. All right, perfect. I have a key here for you. You're gonna be on the sixth floor today. You're gonna head around straight to the elevator, okay? - Great, thank you. - Uh-huh. Remember, I'm here on business. So I don't wanna hear anything. I don't wanna see you acting pathetic about pregnancy. Understand? Good evening. This is my fiance Mikhela. Good evening. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. - It's nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. Why don't you guys chat it up? ♪ Yeah ♪ ♪ Hey ♪ ♪ Hoo ♪ - Hi, baby. - Oh. Hey. Shh. No! Clint! Dumb ass little brat. Hmm. Bryce, there was a woman found behind the hotel with the realtor's convention that happening this weekend. On the news reports said she appeared to be engaged and had a ring on. Didn't you say he had a fiance? Sash. No, I checked the convention website, and the company that held the open house down the street is the sponsor. What if it's him? What if it was her? Sash, you're taking this too far. I'm serious, Bryce. What if that was his fiance? What if he has something to do with this? Could the police finally do something? But you're not afraid, remember? - I'm not afraid. - Right. Not afraid. I'm not afraid. Not afraid. Good evening. We begin our broadcast with breaking news. Last Saturday we reported a woman had been found behind the Vida Grand Hotel, where the National Capital Realtors Convention was held last weekend. The woman has been identified as 33-year-old Mikhela Ford. Her death has been ruled a homicide. Mom, did you? No, BJ. Turn it off. Turn it off, BJ. Can I sleep with you and Dad tonight? Of course. In fact, BJ, we might have you go stay with your grandparents for a few weeks. Since school is out they've been asking about you. That'll give time for me and your mother to get some stuff done around here, okay? Okay. Wow. Cannot believe you kept that. Of course. What woman wouldn't? I wanna go to the cops. It doesn't prove anything. Yes, it does, Bryce. He was around my car. He's following me. Must've slipped it through the window. Must've left it cracked. I want you to drive my truck for a little while, okay? My gun will be in the front, loaded. It just takes one shot, babe. Your car will stay here. I'll be the only one to drive it, okay? He can't do this. He can't interfere with my family. My son is scared and doesn't know why. I'm gonna take care of this. I just need you to do what I'm asking for now. I promise you I'll not let anything happen to you or BJ. I'm a few weeks late. We got this time. Don't touch me. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. Can I help you with something? Um, yes. I'm looking for my real estate agent. He said he'd be in touch, but it's been a little while, so I thought I'd come by the office. What's your agent's name? Miss? What's your agent's name? Um, he has brown eyes, about 5'10". Oh my gosh! I am so sorry for your loss. You look so much like Mikhela. You two must've been close. Please, if there is anything that we can do, please let us know. Clint quit and left town right after it happened. My name's Clint, okay? Please, give him our love. Clint? He's gone. Excuse me. Good morning, sweetheart. Good mornin'. You slept like an angel. I did, huh? I guess I feel so much better knowing that man Clint is gone. Yeah. I think I'm ready to drive my car again, Bryce. - Yeah? - Mmm-hmm. Okay. Well, let's stick to our plan of checking in with each other. Okay. He's here. He's still here. He knows exactly where I am all the time. What are you talking about? I saw him in my car at work. I saw him getting out of my car. That monster's been taking my car all this time! Babe, babe, this stops now. Right here and now. This man has no boundaries. Yo. Dirtyman. That's good, bro. That's good. Yeah, that's real good. Hey, I need a favor from you, man. Yeah. It's clear, Mrs. Dade. You can exit. I want you both to understand this Schilling and Row campaign is gonna be different. They are determined to be the first to get the data, so their in-house marketing analysts are gonna manage that part of the process, but they want us to generate the ROI reports. Oh, great. I can tell it's going to go well. Let's not shoot it down yet. They have a hell of a team. They can crunch numbers with or without built-in tools. We signed off on this partnering agreement, so we're in it for the duration. Media's gonna start running next week, so those early analytics will be crucial. We have the potential to generate a lot of impressions among younger and older audiences. If we can 13-year-olds in the same room with their parents talking about issues and not texting across the room, we're gonna have something huge. Yes, I'll drink to that! Well, just one drink. I'm trying, okay? I have some more information by the campaign I wanna share with you both. I was speaking about it with our Schilling and Row counterparts last night. I need to grab the file. Can you two continue without me? - Sure thing. - Okay. Oh, and by the way, the non-profit campaign is tracking well. I'll keep you both posted. Somebody help me! I need you. I tried! Just listen! Sasha, I saw you on that plane, I had to protect you. I have to protect you, okay? No, you can't save me! I know. I saved my mom, too. Why are you trying to hurt me? I saved her. I killed that mouse. Somebody help me! Bashed me sometimes, so I had to kill her. No! No! No, I'm gonna make you see, Sasha. We're gonna be great together. We're gonna be great together. Here, read this. Read it! Louder! As a result of this campaign, and this business, we are taking a different agency and Mr. Clint Meyers is my agent. See? I gave you that nickname, Sasha. We're gonna be great together. We're gonna have a beautiful life together, Sasha. I've already got a perfect home picked out. There's room for a daughter. When you're ready, your son can move in, too. Okay? Are you ready, baby? Are you ready? Yes. I'm ready. Okay. Good. I'll get the car. Okay. And Sasha. I knew you'd see it my way. Damn. Your wife's a beast. That motherfucker's all but done. Should've left her alone and my boy. Sasha, I know you need me. You're really special. It's really just you and me. This is my love. ♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ♪ You are more than beauty.
