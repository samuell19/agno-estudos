Where are you going? To buy some soup. Yuko! Wellcome. I'd like some soup. I want two tapioca. two tofu and two fritters. In separate bowls. With lots of sauce. Yuko... Tell me... Why were you fired? You know why! You don't have to ask! Mr. Takai... Come and see me during your break. I want to speak to you. Thank you. So... are things calming down? What do you mean? Are there as many anonymous phone calls? How many per day? I've never counted them... but a dozen, I guess. That many, after all this time! Haven't you considered taking action? Action? Changing your phone number or even moving house... Make your mind up! Why don't you change your identity? You know that our director, Mr. Ando, arrived yesterday. He summoned me this morning. To talk me about you. find out what you were doing. To ask me what you were doing! How should I know? But it's crazy, you know! The company still receives abusive phone calls and emails. Even Head Office is harassed. It's true, everyone knows about it. The receptionist can't cope with the situation. Tell me what it is you want to say. Do you want me to resign? I wouldn't go that far... But when I see the harm caused to the company's management, it's quite beyond me. if I resigned, where would I find another job? Anywhere. There's plenty of work around. Think it over. You will get your severance pay in full. But do it without delay. I'm counting on you to handle formalities. Mr Ueki... I beg you... I beg you to keep me on. I can't resign. I beg you... Look! Going over there as a volunteer! You've spoiled her. My daughter... is a victim. She was taken hostage. Why must she be persecuted? I beg you. It's the truth! I'm beggin you. We're not here right now. Please leave your name and message after the tone. Hello... You're there, aren't you? Don't act the innocent. Answer me! Hello? Ever thought about the word, "self-resposibility"? You will know the Lord's vengeance. It's crazy! If you'd been killed, you'd have become a heroine. No, certainly not in Japan. Anyway, you came home. Without a shame! Are you listening to me? It's a very important question. Couldn't you at least answer me? Mrs Takai, please. A family matter. -It's me. -What's wrong? I've just... handed in my notice. What? Mr Ueki told me... he'd been summoned by the director. It was over Yuko. They're still bombarded with abusive phone calls and emails about her. He was ordered to find a solution. A solution... What solution? Well, he was told to fire me. The company's image was at stake. He didn't want to keep me any longer. I realized I was done for. I knew it would happen one day. So, I wrote my letter of resignation and gave it to my boss. You've handed in your notice? Yes, I have. But why? You could've talked to the union... The situation would've been unbearable. Maybe, but... Where are you now? Outside the factory gates. My head's all messed up. I need to get my head straight. but I wanted to tell you... before I did anything else. But what's all the rush? Sorry I decided this on my own. But you know. I got down on my knees. I couldn't stand it... I love you. I love you all. Yuko? Hello. What? You've answered at last! What? Why this "what"? What? Let's meet up. So we can talk things over. You've been back for six months. and we haven't seen each other once. Let's meet up, OK? One of these days... Is that you, Yuko? I know you're home. Why won't you answer? I threw away the phone. What happened? Did you answer the phone? Did someone say something? I wanted to talk to you about your father... I threw it away! Yuko... Want to meet up? Where? It's been a long time... What do you want to tell me? You want us to split up, right? If so, there's no need to meet up. You've changed. In what way? I haven't changed at all. That's exactly what I mean. You're more and more stubborn. You don't listen to people. It's always been the same... You think of no one but yourself. Me? Yes. I only think of myself? How do you mean? Didn't you go over there to die? A dangerous country at war... What was the sense in that? All you did was embarrass everybody. Me? I embarrassed people? Who? Everyone. The whole of Japan. Didn't you even see that? So, you disapprove of me, too? Why got ot some foreign country and help the people there? If you have so much time, there's this country, this town you could look after. I don't think we speak the same language. What're you talking about? That's what I've always hated about you. Volunteering is OK for people with the time and money. It doesn't suit you at all! Not at all! I said OK! I get it. Enough. Evening. I got fired I handed in my notice, as a matter of form. But I got fired alright. It's totally crazy. Two people unemployed in this family! And both at almost the same time. When I left the factory, I called your stepmother. I told her everything, and after I hung up. I wondered what I was going to do. To help me think, I thought of going to a bar, but I came straight home. The fear of doing without no doubt. Just the idea of being out of work... I didn't have the courage to go for a drink. Even so... being fired just like that after 30 years in the same firm... It sure hurts. Is it because of me? You condemn what I did? You're wrong. Am I? Why am I wrong? Tell me. Why are you looking at me like that? Listen... Is it wrong to establish links with people? Is feeling connected to others that bad? -It's a good thing. -Well, then... I told you. I don't condemn you in any way. Didn't I support you from the start? Being a volunteer is a hard choice to understand. After what happened, it's even harder. Didn't you expect disapproval? You congratulated me though. You said: "I'm glad you came back." "It's not your fault or of others over there." That's true. We've been over all this for long enough now. I'd just like a bit comfort today. What'll we do... now? I have no idea. I want to die. They say that those who talk about suicide never do it. But I'm different. Don't talk silly! I'm useless. I tell Yuko she must be strong and live. But when it's about me, I'm completely useless. Let's wait. Just wait and see. Time will sort everything out in the end. Even waiting... is hard. Let's wait. In Mother Teresa's Words Isn't that Yuko? It's been a long time! Say, you had a narrow escape! Still living with your father? Just look at you! You look like an artist. Babies... Yeah, this one's mine. They're the same age. What about you? Not getting married? What's your boyfriend's name? -Mr Iwai. -That's right, Mr Iwai. Weren't you going out together? I left him. No! Mr Iwai's got another girlfriend. ?Really? Yuko, you did know, din't you? They're getting married soon. It's true. Sorry for being so indiscreet. You should have an arranged marriage. Get married, have a kid - that'll make you see sense. Don't be silly. Yuko has always refused a life like that. Her world is nothing like ours. Right, Yuko? You'll carry on with your work, won't you? Yuko's a good person. We couldn't do what she does. Absolutely. We couldn't go and help other people. We wouldn't have a clue where to start! Yuko! Hey, let's go drink a cup of tea! I heard your husband lost his job. So, it's true... Is it over you-know-what? It must be that, mustn't it? What on earth is "that"? You-know-what... Answer me. What's "that"? What's wrong? You're weird, you know. It's hard... waiting. Want a coffee? I'll make some. The insurance... Dad's life assurance, how much is it? Why do you ask? I think I'm entitled to it, too. I want to leave. Go back over there They're all waiting for me. I need some money. Drop it, will you? I'm going to need... that money. Idiot! Idiot! Give him back to me! My husband! Give me back my husband! I'd like some soup. Some soup. I read the paper. Doesn't it bother you? You killed your father... and it doesn't affect you? Don't come back here. I forbid you to. I'd like to book a flight to Amman. Via Moscow. Mother... Mother... I've booked a flight. I'm leaving next Tuesday. I won't be coming back. Are you really going? Nobody needs me here. Everybody hates me. It's obvious to me. It's been like that since I was a child. At school, I was a bad pupil. I had few friends. I didn't have a best friend. I was dumped by my first love. I even failed to get into university. I wanted to design clothes. but I couldn't get an apprenticeship. I failed everywhere. I may be a dead loss... But even so, I was useful for the first time. Under the bombs, amid the wounded... holding a pregnant woman's hand reassured her. Japanese candy... made the children so happy. They'd crowd around me. "Yuko" here, "Yuko" there... They'd kiss me. I want to live with those children's smiles... Otherwise I... Otherwise I... I do realize, you know, that I'm just doing as I please. Dad told me. With charity work and selfless acts, at best, you embarrass people, but you never get thanks, that's for sure. He told me that if I felt ready, he would support me. He'd do all he could to help me. And now... I'm begging for my share of the insurance money. I know I'm saying terrible things. But you know... I can't stay here. I don't want to. People here are so cold. I have to act cold, too. And if I stayed, I would have to become cold, too. Just thinking about it makes me not want to go on living. Over there, you feel good. I feel good. I loved Dad a lot. but he was weak. I'm going to carry on. I'll always side with the others. Maybe I've acted cold, too. Without realizing it. Do you know it's the first time... the very first time... you've called me "Mother"? I'm so pleased. Here... For the journey. Thank you. I won't go with you to the airport. I understand. Soon we won't see her anymore. The train is leaving That's it, we can't see her anymore. The train has left, she has gone When the sun rises, I will return When the sun rises, I will return One time only I will return When the sun rises, One time only I so liked that girl But she doesn't live here anymore I so liked that girl But she doesn't live anywhere anymore I heard she was all alone I found out she was all alone I thought that this town was very sad And I fell asleep Before leaving this town Before leaving this town I shut the windows And I fell asleep Screenwriter and Director: KOBAYASHI Masahiro Yuko: URABE Fusako Her father: TANAKA Ryuzo Her lover: KATO Takayuki The father's boss: HONDA Kikujiro The hotel owner: KAGAWA Teruyuki The stepmother: OTSUKA Nene Cinematography: SAITO Koichi Song: HAYASHI Hiroshi Editing and postproduction: KANEKO Naoki Subtitles: J.
