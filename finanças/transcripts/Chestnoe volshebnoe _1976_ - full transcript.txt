Did you wash up, Czyz? Mhm. And combed your hair? Mhm. So now you're perfectly clean? Ehh, it'll do! It'll do? "It'll-Do" was an evil witch. You know what her favourite saying was. «I wouldn't be the evil witch It'll-Do, if you did things properly!». All this is fake! No, you didn't do your hair properly... Mom, look, what is this? A fat quartz. It looks like a Doctor in a sparkling mantle. Papa, what is this stone for? Flint. Once upon a time, with it's help, people lit fires. And guns were made with triggers in which flints were inserted. Because of this, all Flints think too highly of themselves. And because of this he thinks, That he is the General-Mineral. Don't mess with the child's head! A flint is a flint. People should see things, exactly as they are in real life. And anyways, hurry up, i'm waiting for you. You can go. And this one, is the very best! Look at how round and smooth it is! Like a chubby prince! Oh mama, mama, what a dreamer you are! An ordinary cobblestone. Right. Geologists are serious people. And they shouldn't tell fairy tales to children. Look! Brown ironstone. We should take a look upstream. It isn't pretty... Because of that, out of him they smelt iron! By the way, it is also made of iron. Ooh come on, you also won't take me with you today? Next time we will! Will you be back late today? Do we look like such people? And besides, we are afraid. You well know that at the camp there always is a guard on duty. Look at the Little Bells (flowers)! Nu, what about it? By the way, here is your hammer. I thank you! They should be ringing right now, but they are quiet. Why? They're shy. Good morning! Ding-Ding! What a magical morning! One... Two... Three... Four... Five... Six... Seven... Seven'o'clock. Heh, that's not a clock, it's a little cuckoo. All sorts of magical things can happen in magical mornings. Look! Oh mom, you are my most... Nu, for now i am not yours, you are mine!. So, listen and obey! First up, Clean your shoes and fix your raincoat. And second, clean up and sweep the place. Third, for how long are you going to mess around? By the way, don't forget your hammer! I won't. And feed the fire! It'll do! Aaah, it'll do... I wouldn't be the evil witch It'll-Do, if you did things properly! I won't wait any further! I'll go for a walk nearby... Doctor Quartz, Prince Cobblestone... Heh, mom, you're such a dreamer... Girl, girl, we are bored, we have nothing to do! Very bored, pick us up, please! Pick us up, we are fantastical! Pfft, what silliness. We go through fairy tales in literature, It introduces us to our culture. But in real life, in real life Fairy tales aren't in this world. We know this, we know this We know this, we are already not small children. Eh, it's fine, it'll do. Only little children believe in fairy tales, But in real life, fairy tales aren't in our world. Here happens, here happens, only the most real things Even wolves, even wolves, are in a zoo. Yet in books the wolves can talk... Good morning! Good morning. And who are you? How to explain this to you... Doesn't it seem to you that everything beautiful and good in this Earth... Should ring? Are Little Bells good? Of course. But they don't ring! Oh yeah? Listen carefully! Come on, try it! Do you hear it? Yeah. I am master Ring. That's nice. Uuh, excuse me, why are you so small?! You can't be higher, than the one you're talking with. Wow, it's just like a fairy tale! Of course! Do you hear? What's that? It's the ring of your cherished wish. Nu, which one? Aah, we can't talk about this, because it's a secret! Of course... Nu, what needs to be done, so that my wish can be realized? You must go to the end of the fairy tale. To the very end! Fairy tales again...... And here i thought that you were going to help me for real. I will help you. I will bring you to the main Fairy Tale Road. If you don't get cold feet or change your mind, You can realize any one wish. Any one, but the road won't be easy. The main thing, is that the evil witch It'll-Do... What did you just say? It'll-Do... Her favourite saying: "I wouldn't be the evil witch It'll-Do, if you did things properly!». Yup, that's right! But none of that is true! And you don't exist, in the real world! How do i not exist?! You see, here i am, me! You don't, and that's all! *sneezes* Bless you! Thank you, but you need to stop sweeping. Don't bother me, i'm sweeping! How can i bother you, if i don't exist. Hmm, it seems that you, after all, exist... Ok. I'll try to go to the end of the fairy tale. It seems, that you didn't fill it up completely? Eeh, it'll do. As you want... Nu, look. The evil witch, sooner or later will teach you this lesson. You'll cry over this... That's all, let's go Let's go. What a wonderful girl! *Song about the evil witch It'll-Do* *Song about the evil witch It'll-Do* *Song about the evil witch It'll-Do* *Song about the evil witch It'll-Do* *Song about the evil witch It'll-Do* *Song about the evil witch It'll-Do* *Song about the evil witch It'll-Do* *Song about the evil witch It'll-Do* *Song about the evil witch It'll-Do* *Song about the evil witch It'll-Do* *Song about the evil witch It'll-Do* *Song about the evil witch It'll-Do* *Song about the evil witch It'll-Do* *Song about the evil witch It'll-Do* *Song about the evil witch It'll-Do* *Song about the evil witch It'll-Do* *Song about the evil witch It'll-Do* What a wonderful girl! But she isn't simple... From one side, she is ours While she's still doing things willy-nilly While she still pronounces this word, dear to my heart: "It'll do", i am the stronger witch in the world. But, as soon as she goes to the end of the tale... And give her magical word to never tell anyone - It'll do for her, but for me, all my power will disappear! What horror! We have to... Have to do what? Have to do something... What a clear and concise thought! I am elevating you to the rank of General-Mineral. Me too! Raise me too to some rank! I want to be... A king. No, you can't be a king. You'd stop listening to me. I'll raise you to the rank of... Uh... I'll raise you to the rank of... Prince... But they already elevated me today to the rank of prince! Then, on top of that, i raise you to the rank of... My nephew! How wonderful, my nephew is a prince! And you... And you, have you also been elevated to some rank? I am Quartz, Doctor Quartz. I am highly esteemed in all fields of science. And you, you will serve me faithfully And i will also nominate you into some rank. For now, i nominate you... The advisor of the Prince-Nephew! I agree. And in such a way, the Prince-Nephew immediately had a brilliant idea... Which one? Let's establish contact with the Ironstone. No. He's always itching to fight! I'll have to sprinkle sparks on him. You are an unenlightened man, even if you emit sparks. While he's a Brown Ironstone, he can't even fight. Aaah, fine, brown or not, bring him anyway. Your will be done! Darling, they are asking for you. There's something wrong with me lads... I feel weak in body, but my soul is strong and asking to come out. Just rely on us. Ok. Not nice. Liquor... Well, pure ethanol. But it'll do. It's all disorganized, good, good... Let's take this... Oh, a little match box. What is that behind us? That which has already happened, What is that in front? That which is to come. You, wonderful song, lead me onward, to more interesting places, much more interesting. The most interesting, is that, which is to come. It'll do. Nice, it's all here, good job! Let's go immediately in a chase after the girl! The main task... The main strategic task... I'll repeat, the main evil task... Is to not let her reach the end of the fairy tale! And why should we go? You see, i should be used for something useful. Well, you will! What is the use of being useful if there's nobody to be useful for? And here i am, you will be useful for me. Let's go, let's go! Sing along, my rock-solid group! *Song about rocks* На травке камни хороши, *Song about rocks* мы будем драться от души. *Song about rocks* Размяться правда нам пора, *Song about rocks* нам браво, нам ура, ура! *Song about rocks* Ура, ура, ура, ура, *Song about rocks* ура, ура, ура, ура, ура! *Song about rocks* How is this a fairy tale road? It's just a normal road... But she goes through many different tales! Hello! Crow. "Grey Wolfe Garden's Plot". Illiterate... Look, a bunny! Oh!!! My favourite wolfie! It's just like my favourite cartoon! Nu, bunny, just you wait! Look at what that bunny hooligan is doing! Every day, every day... He runs after me and mocks me! Do stand-up, hard-working, honest bunnies act this way?! And then he accuses me of being a bad wolf! They compose about me all sorts of fairy tales!. And you, are you by chance not Red Riding Hood? No, no, what are you talking about?! Pity. Otherwise you could confirm, That i never ate you, or your grandma. *birds talking* All wolves are hooligans! True! True! They look like exemplary birds... But in fact, they are all gossipers! Not true! Look at how they slander me! And you, do you believe that i'm good? That i don't eat grandmas? Of course. You're the best girl in the world! Could i, could i go with you guys? Yup! Let's go! Thanks. Give me your paw. Here, we experiment with spring sounds. Larisa! Do you job! But we already passed spring. It's for the future. And what is this? This is for the ringing of spring wind. This is our compositor, Lesovitchyok. When will we start? We'll start now. Get ready! Why is it that he is conducting an orchestra, but no music is ringing? Everything was ringing so nicely, but you ruined it all! What did i ruin? The symphony. What kind of symphony is this? Just birds singing in the woods, That's all. You should have apologized... Nu, should i have stood in front of all the boys and apologized? It'll do. It'll do. Uraaa! It'll do! It'll do! Hello, Ring! Hello, hostess. Where are all your workers? They are swimming over there, in the lake. We already put the summer sounds in place. These are the last ones, listen to how nicely they jingle. It's so hot here! Look, Ring, look at our slacker-rainmaker! They went to ask for rain sounds from him, but he... But he just sits there, lazily making one drop at a time. Let's go take a swim, it's hot! Let's go together, i also love swimming! And so do the ducklings! Let's run! Let's go! They need rain! What are you doing?! You'll have you rain! You, what do you want? You can't do that! You can! Here it is... It'll do. Hey! Stop, stop, stop! There are ducklings in the lake! The hail will kill them! Ura, ura, ura, ura! You can't be trusted with the hammer! Get out! I won't be able to guide you further... the Earth needs rain sounds But i will provide you a reliable guide You have to learn well, no matter where you are, But in nature it's better than anywhere else. Because there must be some sort of order, Even in unexpected rain. Crystal-Stream, hop over here! Droplets go din, droplets go din, droplets go dong, And droplets have a nice "Do". *Crystal-Stream Song* "До" бывает вежлевый, прямо возле облака. *Crystal-Stream Song* "До" бывает нижний, это уж внизу. Guide, please, Marina and Wolf through our kingdom. Droplets all look so similar, But each produces an unique sound. Din-don, din-don, din-don. I'll do it with pleasure! Dance with me! Hey you, up there! In the short pants! Quick, tell me, did some scarily ugly girl Pass by here? A girl passed by, but she was pretty. She was together with master Ring. That's them!! Let's go! Be more careful, lads! There they are, our autumn sounds. Eat with gusto! And me? Can wolves eat watermelons? We'll find out. Be my guest. Thank you! Come here! Faster! So cold here! Girls! Girls! We have guests! Marina, can i please take a small nap? I'm so interested in sleeping here! The girl is probably here, onward! Brrr, so cold! Is there not some winter clothes here? Are you looking for something? What is it to you? It's just that curious barbarians have their noses torn off... What? What? Barbarians?! Noses torn off... Maybe barbarians have their noses torn off, but i myself want to tear someone's nose apart! I'll grab you like this and... Don't! Don't! How can i live without a nose? You'll live, it won't be great but It'll Do. What are you doing, huh? My fellow cultured people... Winter, ah... You're Mother Winter. Nu, you froze my nose off! I-it's no big deal, i-i wouldn't be the great evil witch It'll-Do, I-if every body part of mine was nice and proper! You got envious of my beautiful nose, huh? *weeps* You took away all my beauty... Wait for me, wait for me in the freezer Be prepared I wouldn't be It'll-Do, If my plans didn't do! Where should we put the tools? Little Marina! Who is this that is coming towards us? You're my golden girl, you're my... Hello, grandpa! Hi, Little Grey. Excuse me, i need to talk to Little Marina in secret. I waited for you for so long, but so long... But i don't know you... Although... Something in you is familiar to me. You see, you and me, we have the exact same Worldview... Listen, don't be stupid, you should stay here. Little Bells, Jingle Bells, continuous songs... Dances, no classes... Can you imagine? That sounds fun, but i have to go to the end of the fairy tale. To carry out one of my wishes. Well... If you want to go to the end of the fairy tale... Then you should immediately turn back to the camp! And don't gossip to anyone about any fairy tales. I'll help you return, i promise. Otherwise i wouldn't be the evil witch It'll-Do. Huh?!? W-what did you say? No!! I must reach the end of the fairy tale! I'll show you, how to go through fairy tales! Catch the girl! Give here! I'll tear you into pieces! Retreat! Onwards, slowpokes! Why does someone like you conduct yourself so badly? It's surprising! It's due to the bad influence of useless types of stones. Nu, let's listen to him now. Something is pressing me from the inside... You see? He has a nice soul. Let's put him through the furnace, And he won't be a brown ironstone, but an Iron Man! Now, we must part Could it be that you can't go any further? The evil witch shouldn't be able to stop you that easily. I'd later be terribly ashamed, If i got scared and turned back to camp. She's not alone! I'll go with her. Could i perhaps also go with you? Of course! Thank you for coming with me! Here, take this. You just have to ring this little bell And immediately, all your friends. Will rush to your aid I am the good Fairy of Ancient Wonders! Oh how i love good fairies... Ok, very well. Take off your clothes! What!! Excuse me, but it is not hot. Quiet, quiet, do it quick All your clothes, take them off! What are you doing?!?! The ground here is wet! You'll rust immediately! I-i mean... Get sick. Sit on my tail,It's very comfortable. There's no need, the ground, it'll do! it'll do Did you hear? Ooh, you're so cute! Our strength increases, and the girl is near. It's time to go, Or mama and papa will be worried... A pity, that you need to go to the end of the fairy tale yourself Otherwise i'd get you there in an instant... Like my grandpa Ivan Tsarevich... And Alyonushka, those two raced... Now those, those were wolves! Let's go? Why are you fighting me??? I'll show you!! I'll show you!! Wolf, guys, i'll stay here And hold them off No, we will hold them off! That's not fair! You'll die because of me! Who is going to die? Who is made of iron, you or me?! Nu, you. Then it's decided. I'll stay here. I'll crush these pebbles, and then catch up to you. I give you my iron word! Wolf, lead this disobedient girl away! Hurry! Let's run! That's our former guy, our former Brown Ironstone Into iron they reforged him... Oh, what masters. No big deal, i'll trick him. He'll recognize you! With such a look, my own blood mother couldn't recognize me. What are you afraid of? I'm not preparing to fight you Iron... True iron. And who are you? Me? I'm the fairy of ancient wonders, retired. And are you a good person? What sort of fairy can be evil?! I am very good! I want to help you Stand here! Ok. Do you guard the bridge? I do. At this time, It'll-Do is swimming, She's there, under the bridge. Where? There she is! Look, there she is! Once brown, always brown. Who are you? I am Crystal-Stream. You're hurt? It's no big deal... I'll help you. I'll wash all your injuries now... And soon you'll heal. Don't! I'll rust! I already rusted.... Please, forgive me... I didn't know But how did you fall into the river? They lead me by the nose, as if i was still brown... But why? Wasn't i tempered?! Surround the girl! What is it? Rub against my fur, so that it stands tall and scary! Lads, onward! Get away! This is my tree! You're doomed now! You can't catch me! I can! I can! If only you broke all your paws, imprudent Grey! Are you off your mind? Do you not know who i am? You what! We wolves, are unenlightened people, we live in the woods. How can we recognize every face in this world?! Hi. Wolf! You won't devour me! I am from Red Riding Hood! I have experience devouring, at the expense of grandmas! Get settled! That's it. While i'm here, they aren't going anywhere. And you, run to the end of the fairy tale! Hurry! Wait, how long will you have to wait here? You'll get hungry, take this! No, no. You'll get hungry yourself Who has the appetite of a wolf, you, or me?! Nasty beast! What will we do? This wolf is waiting for us... His highness just had the most brilliant idea! I am the highness! It means it was my idea! Which idea? Let flint turn back into a stone Then he'll fall on the wolf's head, and kill him! What an idea! This is far from a bright idea!!! Why should i be the one to fall?! let Cobblestone fall! You! Immediately transform and fall! I won't! I am a flint, and my word is firm like a flint! That's right... A flint. Then let Prince-Cobblestone fall. No. Helper, what are you afraid of? He can't eat rocks! At most he'll drool over you a bit and that's it But that is at least tolerable! And the girl, by the way, is already far! Meanwhile, here we are, sitting like birds on branches. Ahh, you nasty coward. Doctor of useless sciences! I as-... FALL IMMEDIATELY! Missed. Aunt, save yourself! Swim, pansies, swim! Hehe I'm not feeling good... I'm not feeling good... I'm not feeling happy... I'll call the neighboring fairy tale. Ancient, spooky. Zero, two zeroes, zero, zero, zero. G-good A-afternoon... Cannibal. My dear little cannibal neighbor... Nu? It's me! Me! The extremely evil witch It'll-Do, is calling you. Through the big Fairy Tale Road, marches a girl So, could you, in fully literal sense, eat her up? She is currently approaching your zone of influence... Is she fat? Well... That's up to you to determine Is she courageous? Well, meet with her in a dark forest... While the owls are hooting... Why would the owls be hooting? Because they should. I wish you a good appetite, dear neighbor. Mersi. Wolf!! I'll tear your ears off! Circle around the tree, Grey, Circle around the tree... While you still can. I have something to eat, and you don't! Soon, you won't... Just like your Iron Man. The poor fellow lies on the botom of the river, rusted. We should probably recycle him as scrap metal And you, you... I'll hand you over to the zoo! Yup, i already called the zoo... See? Here's the telephone. They're already coming. Allo? Yes, he's here! Foxes lie better than you! You, you're just a crow! Answer this one question of mine, wolf. I sit here and think... It's probably pretty bad to live in a cage What are you looking at?! Well, Look! I-i... I-i... I don't want to look at you! Child, come on, open your eyes and look! Look at how scary i am! Please! Scary? I'm not afraid of you at all! Just get off the road! I don't want to hang around you, that's all. I stand, like a mountain. A hurrah to me! Who can handle a mountain? A hurrah to me! I'm a hero. Here you are dancing, but for your knowledge... My friends are rushing over! Wolves, and Iron People Enough lying! While your wolves are running over, i'll have already eaten you! Humans for lunch, this is good I love humans! I'm not thinner than anyone... Stop! You are in a public area. This road is not for dancing. And also, get out of the way! I'm in a rush. Nasty girl! There is nowhere for you to rush to. Although you are a bit thin... You're not fat. Ah, it's a triffle, no big deal. The skinny ones are still good for making soup! I'll digest your thinness... I'm a hero! A hurrah to me! It's time for me to lunch! Y-you... Y-you're no cannibal. You're just an ordinary hooligan! I'll die... But not from you! Now i'll... I'll... Tear you apart! What?! Oi! It'll do. It'll do, It'll do... Allo! What? You what?!... What sort of creature did you send to me?! It is food, no? It is a girl, no? It's... It's... A witch!! Well... I wanted to tell yo- There's no way to deal with her! My legs can't stand running anymore! She fears nothing! Snake! *Spits* Let him think that the phone line cut off... Allo? What sort of meanness you had in mind! Trying to trick me! It's for your own good that nothing bad happened to Marina... I'll stand below the tree... Until you come down out of hunger! What?! Why were you eavesdropping on the telephone consversation of other people? I wasn't eavesdropping! I just have wolfy hearing and wolfy appetite... I'll eat you, and then run after the cannibal! Cannibals don't eat wolves! But wolves eat cannibals! That simple! You what? I'm so skinny... You can't eat me... I'm not tasty... You can eat me only with jelly. But wolves don't eat jelly. No big deal, instead of jelly i'll eat you with wolfberries! With wolfberries?! It'll do! What did he say? It'll do? Should have said it right away! I summon you, Fire! Just don't get near me... Krika, kraka, bra.. It'll do! Rush to the Land of Glue, and burn it all! You what?! Are you off your mind?! The Land of Glue? That's the end of the fairy tale! And if there's no end to the tale... The girl can never reach it... You scoundrel! *Fire Song* *Fire Song* *Fire Song* *Fire Song* *Fire Song* *Fire Song* *Fire Song* *Fire Song* *Fire Song* *Fire Song* *Fire Song* *Fire Song* *Fire Song* *Fire Song* *Fire Song* *Fire Song* *Fire Song* *Fire Song* *Fire Song* *Fire Song* Fire! Chase Wolf! What will you give me? This! Kerosene. Kerosene... No, alcohol! Pure ethanol, for special occasions! It burns no worse than kerosene! You what! But you tempered Iron Man! You're an useful member of society! Come here, come. Where are you going? And now, to the Land of Glue! Like a lightning! Here i am! Why have you come to our creek? I want to gleam. Why is this? When i was a campfire, i gleamed. When you were a campfire, you gleamed. In vain. What was there to watch? Like soup, they poured things onto me. And here, in the kingdom of Glue... I was ordered to burn down the whole kingdom. No, you won't do this! You'll see. I don't believe you. Well, look! *Fire Song* *Fire Song* *Fire Song* *Fire Song* *Fire Song* *Fire Song* *Fire Song* *Fire Song* *Fire Song* *Fire Song* *Fire Song* *Fire Song* *Fire Song* *Fire Song* *Fire Song* *Fire Song* *Fire Song* *Fire Song* How did you guess i was here? I didn't guess you were here... I wanted to look for you under the river. It'll-Do told me, that you'll rust. What difference does it make, rust here, or rust there. I'm still rusted all over. I can't bend my leg or my arm. How can i now give aid to Marina? Meanwhile, you're fine, you can rush to her aid. Ugh, wait, i have medicine! Bread with butter, i'll smear it over you! You what! Give it here. The rust is interior... I'll eat the butter. Eat. Butter. Water... Crystal-Stream... Water. Right away! Wait. I need more, otherwise i can't get up. I... Didn't fill the flask up completely! I thought... It'd... It'd... I thought there was enough water, I thought there was enough water... Nu, don't cry! I know, what we need to do. Endure! What is this?! What is this?! Did everyone hear "It'll"? But where is "Do"?! Why did this dumb machine grow quiet?! It's possible that the battery died. How could it have died? Let's find a new one? Nowhere! Nowhere can you find a battery here. On "nowhere" you can't sit. We need a battery! On just an "It'll", it won't do. It turned out to be just nonsense! Damned machine! Wow! What is this? What is this, can you explain this with science? Did it somehow scientifically fly off? No, it is completely unscientific. Ah! I know... It... fantastically flew off. Now i'll make you all fantastically fly off!! Now i'll make you all fly, shine and have fun. We must... Seize the girl in the Kingdom of Glue. Before she starts saying some nonsense after "It'll", Instead of "Do". ... Lay down! It's not burning! The Kingdom of Glue still stands, as if it was brand new. Nu, Fire, this Won't Do! He drank the alcohol, but didn't do anything. That's normal. That's normal. That's right, it's normal. As soon as the girl, Comes to this Glue house. We rush in after her, and... Glue her mouth shut! Then, never in her life will she be able to utter the cursed words "I give my magic word!". She approaches! Hello! Could you please tell me, where the fairy tale ends? I really need to rush there! Could it be that something happened? I must save Crystal-Stream... I really really wish, That there immediately came strong rain. The road to the end of the fairy tale goes through the Kingdom of Glue There, right? Here. Rain is pouring... How wonderful! How wonderful! They organized some rain... The fire now can't get here. And who is that old man? Their Chief master, Glue. All here are masters, they glue, glue, they all glue. Everything that was shattered, that cracked... Dishes, health, friendship. I must return to Crystal-Stream! I'll run back now. I left her there alone... But you saved her. No, she was so weak and pitiful... What if she can't even get up? I need to go to her aid. Well, i'll be going. Where are you going?! What do you mean where? To Crystal-Stream. For her, i made up rain. But what if the rain does not reach where she is? Excuse me, but i must go! Huh? What is this... It's very simple, you came, but then went back. Which means that the wish won't be realized. Yes, but what happened with Wolf, with Crystal-Stream, And with Iron Man? They all remained back there. You can only find that out in the end of the fairy tale... Nu, fine. No, this has to stop! Maybe we should ask them to? You what! Cobble, roll after Fire. Find him by following his fiery trail. As soon as they enter, follow them! You have to learn well, no matter where you are, But in nature it's better than anywhere else. Because there must be some sort of order, Even in unexpected rain. *Glue Song* *Glue Song* *Glue Song* *Glue Song* *Glue Song* *Glue Song* *Glue Song* *Glue Song* Nu, how have you been? When i was little, I also loved to play with dolls. Nu, bye. We must go further. I need to go to the end of the fairy tale. As fast as possible. Our masters. Could this be... Rubber cement? Correct, master. Rubber cement, but this... I don't know... Master of office glue. Ahh, i know. This is such an odd glue. Honoured carpentry glue... Here you go. Be nice, little girl. Thank you. And you, you must endure. Your master is very busy. He is gluing back the hand, of some not very careful boy. It's complicated work, He must glue back in every little piece And you, it was only your ear that was torn off. Tell me, what would happen in such a case, That my original wish does not match the wish i made in your kingdom, That is, the wish which i came all the way here for? How can i make my original wish also come true? What did you first hope to wish for? I hoped to wish, that i became similar to my parents. Could it be that you're not similar? Not a bit... I'm a wuss. Mama and Papa are geologists Everything that they search for, they find. And me? I can never finish anything i start. You can't go there! What's the matter? Why not? I was sitting here. Ask the people! It's my turn now. You need to wait your turn. What did you say? "You need to wait your turn"?! You're my darling, You're my blood sister, you're more important to me than my own mother, listen! What do you need to glue together? Glue what? Ah, glue... Right, glue. Well you... You know what to glue. I'll tell you now, what to glue... Wait a minute. This... What's it called Rose. No, that's not it! Ah, there it is... Nose. Do you understand? My friend, some imprudent hag tore off my nose! In literal meaning, can you imagine? Even though me and her didn't even have any bad blood... What can you do... Wait there, it'll be your turn after that citizen. I'll sit for as long as you wish for, dear sister. I sat down, you see? It's all fine, you have it all under control. And to you, what happened? They tore off my... These are my relatives. We are close to her, blood related. Brother, brother-in-law. They are accompanying me. I am in a terrible state... I can barely speak. Get some rest. Sit down, guys. But don't break the chairs or any furniture. Behave like cultured men. This is for tears. We now have to wait... Hey, and you. Where are you hurting? What was torn off? My ear... You what! Ear, ear, that's a small triffle. And me, you know, it was my nose! Stop squirming! Stand still! You must let the glue dry! But i am dry enough! It'll do! Let me go!! Just because you're a doctor, you think you can now decide my whole life? What is she, crazy?! Come here fast!! Fire!!! Wait here! Drink, my cutie, drink! Never! Drink, it's very sweet! Don't interfere in me working! This is anti-fire jam! Save me! Fire! Help! Help me! Run! You'll catch fire. It seems that now, i am settling my debt. At last... I have been tempered. There is not much fire smouldering... I don't care! It'll do, it'll do. There are still places for me to walk through... Alive, It'll-Do is alive. Alive, It'll-Do is alive. Onwards! Go home! Quick Fireplace. Oi! What are you doing! Girl, girl! Citizens! What are you doing? Take this wolf away from here! Sitting on a branch is not confortable! The wolf will blow me away! Blow me away! Hehe... Good job wolf, It'll... I advise you to repeat after me! I give my magic word. Marina! Don't say it! I give my magic word, To never utter "it'll do"! Because of that girl, i'm ruined! What is this behind - Behind is old troubles. What is this ahead - Ahead is new roads. Sing a wonderful song, bring me ahead... Where it's much more interesting, a lot more interesting... It's much more interesting that, Which lays ahead.
