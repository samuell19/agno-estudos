Come on, Cecile. Excuse me? That's her name. Amusing, isn't it? The cyclamen is for her? For Inspector Maigret. It's his name day. These aren't cyclamens. In Botany, we call those primulaceous plants. - You know your stuff, Brigadier! - I adore botany! - Hey! - What? - It's Cecile! - Marius opens the door and sees... - Cecile! Inspector Maigret, if you please. - Hello. - Hello, Inspector. Hello, Paul. How's it going, Paul? Hello. - What's going on here? - It's Maigret's name day. Only you remembered. Look in the aquarium! Cecile. I saw. I hear wedding bells! There's Maigret! Hello. What's he done? - Burglary. We've got news. - What is it? - Look in the aquarium. - Cecile? - Okay, okay... She's a good-looking kid! We can't all be as good-looking as you. There's someone for you in the aquarium. - I know, I know. Happy name day, Chief! Thanks for the pot of begonias. "Cyclamens", Chief. Not begonias, primulaceae. It's for you, Chief. Hello? Hello. Is that you, my darling? This is Cecile. I've had enough! I won't play the clown at Headquarters. Hello? It's for you, Chief. Another prank. Give it to me. Are you done pissing me off? Oh, sorry Boss. I didn't recognize your voice. I'm coming. Thanks for nothing! I've got other things to do. - You don't have the key? - No. You're always losing something. What now? Nothing! They lost the key to the closet. Yes, Minister. Yes, yes. Understood, Minister. Come in. Come in, Maigret. Sorry for what just happened. No, no, it's nothing. - Inspector Maigret. - Hello, Judge. The man who works by hunches. I don't waste time. - Please... - Come on... You don't staff the police with choirboys. Mr. Dandurand, Director of the Work and Discipline Foundation, who reforms juvenile delinquents. I'm seen him in juvenile court. I like to involve myself in the psychology of these young people, victims of a bad education. I've gotten some good results. It's Mr. Dandurand who'll take on Louvier's case, for whom you've obtained an acquittal. Ah, very well. You'll see that you won't be sorry. Work and Discipline. That's our program. Isn't that right, my young friend? If you'd come to my office... - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Say goodbye to the Director. - Goodbye. He's got a head for court cases. Not everyone is a killer. - A cigarette? - Thanks, but I'm a pipe-smoker. - Will you allow me? - Of course. What's wrong today? Cecile's in the aquarium. - Again? - Everyone's laughing at me. - What does she want? - To tell me some crazy story. - Then take her to the Infirmery. - But she's perfectly sane. - Married? - No. - Young? - More or less. It's simple: She's in love with you. Oh no, not you too! She's followed your cases in the newspapers. You're as famous as a movie star. Come on, Boss. And my counterfeiters, when will you put a stop to them? It's coming along. It's a minor case. Ah yes. It isn't an exciting case. Killers aren't always involved. - So long, Boss. - Maigret... Say hello to Cecile for me. Cecile Pardon. Come in! Good day. Now what? Make it quick, I'm busy. I thought it was necessary to see you. I've come to you because I know your reputation. Never mind that. Cecile Pardon, 25 years old. You live with your aunt in Levallois. Yes. Near the bridge. Your aunt is an invalid, and you're her nurse. Yes. You've noticed some objects have been disturbed. Just last night. Some chairs were moved. The desk had been opened and I could smell tobacco. A man's tobacco. What do you mean, "a man's tobacco"? Like yours. It wasn't me! We live alone. No one has the key. The lock is a safety lock. What's more, no lock had been forced open. Nothing was missing. - So? - So what? What's your complaint? I'm afraid. At your age, one isn't afraid of ghosts anymore. This isn't a ghost. I tied up some strings between the desk and the chair. This morning, they were broken. At night, there's not a sound? - I sleep like a log. But in the morning I feel nervous. - You've read too many detective stories. - I only read my aunt's paper at night, when I have a cup of tea. I have a delicate stomach. When I have a minute, I'll come see you. That's what I wanted to avoid. My aunt would react badly. Then what do you want from me? I want you to stay up several nights on the staircase. Is that all? Come on in! Oh, I'm sorry. I'm not intruding? Go on, idiot, spit it out! We know where the counterfeiters are. - Where? - Quai de Grenelle. Go get my hat. I'm coming. I'm sorry, but I'm very busy. Go back home. Don't fret. I don't want to bother you, but I've total faith in you. That's very kind of you. Don't forget your purse. You could fit a regiment in there. And your umbrella. Now go home. Goodbye. Things will pass. With age. Strange girl. Boss... She's been telling this story for six months. - Will we need a car? - A big one. For 27 seated, 72 standing and 300 piled in. Buy my lottery tickets! Today's your lucky day. Cecile! What's wrong? Are you ill? I have an incurable illness: Failure. Gerard, you've been drinking again. Oh, hardly. Just enough to take it. What do you mean, "take it"? The problems that never stop coming, Helen's having a baby... I must have 10,000 francs, little sister. 10,000 francs? Where do you expect me to get it? Ask Aunt. I don't dare go myself. It's a fortune! But for her, it's nothing. You know her. She never would. So much the worse. Gerard! You wouldn't... It's the only choice Helen and me have got. Goodnight, everybody! No more luck, no more problems... Don't say that. There's the concierge. Mr. Gerard, we haven't seen you in a long time. Are things going well? Yes, Mrs. Petitot. And your wife, will it be soon? Tomorrow or never. You've always got something funny to say. Wait here. I'll speak to her. I must speak to you. It happened again tonight. Lottery tomorrow. Today's your lucky day! How that bitch annoys me with her "luck"! Life's a lottery. Your sister didn't pick a good number. It takes courage to stay with your aunt, that old cow. With respect! - Is that you, Cecile? - Yes, Aunt. It took you long enough. Where have you been for two hours? I could have died all alone. Not that you'd give a damn. Have you got my paper? Get my glasses. They're on the fireplace. I saw Gerard. That good for nothing! - His wife is going to have a baby. - Lot of good that'll do him! Get me my handkerchief. - He needs money. - Not a cent, you understand? But it's expensive. He should have thought of that before. That good for nothing! He always catches the Devil by the tail. Problems make him feather-brained. - Exactly... - But you didn't close the door! - All the same... - You're interrupting me? This is my house, don't forget. Close the door. Yes, Aunt. I must go shopping, and I don't have any money. - You've spent it all? Yes, Aunt. We'll see about this. Get my ledger. Money...Money. I don't keep it by being charitable! Cecile! - Yes, Aunt. Well, where are you? Here's 5 francs for shopping. From now on we'll keep close track. Carrots, 3 francs. 3 francs for carrots? Yes, Aunt. Isn't she done yet? Your aunt hasn't badgered her yet. That isn't a life. You should have taken her with you, with respect! Later. I don't say this out of curiosity. With respect! You piss me off! - What? I've had enough of your "respect"! Respect for the dead, respect for the old, respect for money... Respect for life! It's such nonsense that keeps us miserable! Yes, that's true. Well? Here. Take this. - What is it? - The key to the apartment. What am I going to do with it? You'll sleep tonight at our place. I'm afraid. Somebody was in again last night. Oh, the moving furniture? I'm afraid, Gerard. I assure you, I'm actually afraid. And you're a man. You only have to come tonight at 5:00. The concierge will be taking the mail up to the fifth floor. I'll be busy with Aunt. She won't hear you come in. Hide in my room. Did you talk to her about the 10,000 francs? Come. - What is it? - It's your fault. You've got me running around. You can see how thin I've gotten. I should gone with her! You don't even need glasses! You could look for them. She's always there. You can bet she doesn't wear out her shoes! We're getting off. - Not here, Chief! - This will get you in shape. I'd like to know this lady. - Who are you? - Police. Where's your boss? He isn't here. He left for the country. On the third floor, second window on the street. That would be Room 17. That room hasn't been cleaned. - Who lives there? - A blonde, she arrived yesterday. You know, me and women... All the same, it's agreeable. She must be a sound sleeper. - I've got my passkey. - Me too. - In the name of God! - Is she dead? She has no head! She has no head... This time, I'm impressed. You're messing with me, Chief. I feel very weak. - Hello, Chief. - Hello. Don't come in here! - Chief. - What? Dr. Pierre? The jailer. Bring him in. - Hello, Inspector. - Come here. Do your tenants usually get killed like this? Have a look. You recognize her? It's difficult. Even if she still had her head! How long has she been at your hotel? Since yesterday. She came in a taxi. Her name? Yesterday I was busy, and I didn't fill out her card. That will cost you! Without a doubt. Blonde, kind of nice, a little dumb. She was travelling? Yes. She had luggage. - Taxi? - Yes. We should find the taxi. Henri Bordeaux. A country girl. I'm wondering how they performed the operation. Come here. You'd certainly know how to use those! What were you doing before you took over this marvelous hotel? - In a way... - What? I was a butcher in Clermont-Ferrand. Oh, a butcher! Keep an eye on him. If you cut off a head, it's to make it disappear! But you can't just carry it off under your arm like an umbrella. What would be the best way to hide it? - A hatbox? - Oh ho! What? I remember. She had two hatboxes. - Two? - Yes, Inspector. Two. I'll need to find the other one. Did anyone visit her? - Can't you remember? - No. That's annoying. We'll have to find that second hatbox. Why is that window open? That's something I'll never understand. What is that? What, Chief? Look at that. "Cecile." - That's funny! - You think that's funny? It's strange, Chief. - What do you think? - Nothing. It's totally unrelated. Maybe it's a clue, a warning... - Ghostwriting. - Is Maigret here? Dr. Pierre. Hello. Hello, Doctor. There's no way to rest easy with you! I was going to dinner with a friend, and I hear there's been a crime. Look at that. Oh dear, this is serious! I'll speed this up. I don't want to miss my dinner. Is something wrong? NO first name to begin an investigation, that's tough. What should we do? Lottery in two days. Today's your lucky day. Let's try our luck. You wait here. Hello, Madam. Oh, look at the pretty kitty. This is Medor. He's cute, isn't he? - What would you like? - An apartment. You're out of luck, with respect. - Did I come too late? - No. All the flats are taken. And written notice is obligatory. - What floor for just single rooms? - The sixth. It's difficult to keep them rented. Something smells good! This is my juice. Coffee comes back up again. I must tell you, I've a weak heart. When it comes up, you just water it! With a tiny drop. - The house keeps busy? - Very much so. On the first floor, there's Mr. Bourniquel, a salesman. On the second... What are you doing here, Miss Nouchy? I was checking for the mail. Here's your mail. Good evening. - Oh really. - She's not shy, that girl! Did you see how she looked at you? An embarrassment to women! She's bold, and all of that. She's not even 16, and every night she goes out everywhere. She's not even French. With respect! That's a relief. Tivechy. What? That's her father's name. - What do they do? - With foreigners, who knows? Strange people. Yesterday, I took them the mail. I knocked: "Enter." I push open the door. And what do I see? Mrs. Tivechy bare naked smoking a cigarette on a chair. And her daughter was there. And the father, what does he do? Nobody knows. He comes and goes with packages. He says he's an engraver. I'll go see the landlady. She's on the sixth floor, on the right. Mrs. Boynet doesn't go out. Thank you, Madam. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Botany is my dream! The language of flowers, it's magnificent. The umbelliferous, the graminae, the papilionaceous, the papaveraceous the ranunculous... It's incredible! I could never pass an exam. Not that I didn't know my stuff. But the examiners... What? My examiners never understood a word I said. All the same, it's not so hard. Excuse me. - Open that! - But... Police! What have you got in there? Sir? Is this Mrs. Boynet's apartment? Yes, sir. Could I see her? I'd like to rent a flat. If you'd wait a moment. - I'm asking for 10,000 francs. - 10,000 francs? You're rich, Aunt. It could save our lives. I'm tired of supporting you. It's for my wife and child. You can't move me. Like moving a rock. Couldn't you be nicer? After all I've done for you! After all you've done for me? I had to get engaged to escape your tyranny! You stuck Gilberte in your cousin's house as an unpaid servant, because she's a relative. And Cecile is your slave! - You ingrate! when you married... You offered me some cheap amount. Cheap! As cheap as you! - You're insolent! - She'll see you now. What can I do for you? - Mrs. Boynet? - Yes. Delighted: My name is Paul Moulin, 39, a bachelor. I'm a funeral director. - There are no cadavers here. Luckily. I've come to rent the apartment. Hello, Miss. Would you allow me to help you? Seeing that your aunt won't fix the elevator. How is our dear Mrs. Boynet? Is she still so hard on you? What suffering, My God! The apartment won't suit you at all. On the contrary, it's ideal. Sixth floor, lovely view, a quiet house... And then my profession gives me a taste for quiet. And it's close to the cemetary... - It's useless to insist. It's you that won't do. Is that you, Cecile? What's the matter? Nothing, Aunt. Oh well... I guess I'll go back to my hotel on Boulevard de Grenelle. Goodbye, Madam. Goodbye. Cecile, stay here. Make sure you pull the door closed! I won't fail to. What are you thinking about? That man? Who, me, Aunt? You were staring at that undertaker. - He's an undertaker? - Yes. - Where are you going? - To make your dinner. I don't want your brother here again. Don't even speak of him. I'm not Public Assistance. - Cecile! - Yes, Aunt? Aunt? - Hand me my glasses. I was too kind to let the three of you in. You're all ingrates. Including you. You put on a sweet face, but it's hypocrisy. Cecile, pass me my chocolate crud. What? My crud! My hands are wet. You only want my money. What misfortune at my age, to be alone, abandoned and sick! All right, all right, all right! Cecile! It must be time for my hot-air treatment. - Here's your mail. - Thank you. - Would you like a glass? - I won't refuse. It's not that I like to drink, but my asthma... It's awful to make you climb all these stairs. Especially with my varicose veins! With respect. We should send around a petition. She's having her rheumatism treatment. What a din! And to have to wait for the mail. With this racket, you could commit murder just so it would stop! With respect. - To your health. - And yours. Sit down, Mrs. Petitot. Would you like another glass? Just one more. Thank you. Ah, finally. Now you can go up. - Thank you, Mr. Dandurand. - Don't forget your paper. Yet there's nothing worth reading. Not one interesting crime! What are the killers up to? Hey! - What is it? - Cecile. It's you again? - Is Inspector Maigret in? - He's very busy. I really must speak to him. Look. She's back again? What does she have in her purse? The head! Berthe Baudoin, 23, 5 feet 1 inches, brunette, disappeared July 14 in Lagny. The guy said she was blonde. Monica Perez, 27, 4 foot 9 inches, disappeared August 3 in Marseille. Reine Duval, 30, 5 feet, disappeared August 17 in Paris, blonde. That's it. None of them match. Come in. Inspector, I don't want to bother you, but she's here again. Who? - Cecile. - I've got no time to waste! She insists. She says it's very important. Show her in. Hello, Maigret. Hello, Doctor. Then she can wait. Well? Ah, that dinner last night! Royal Rabbit. And my headless woman? The work of an amateur, but done properly. She was strangled first. Clear marks of it. Wisp of a girl. - And the head? - Still missing. We've looked in the checkrooms of caf?s and train stations, but nothing's turned up. Disgusting crime. I think the jailer's innocent. We got prints, but there were so many! Show him in. An eyewitness. - Then I'll be seeing you, Maigret. - Goodbye, Doctor. - I want to see Inspector Maigret. - About what? - Is there a photographer? - No. Too bad. I was cruising Boulevard de Vaugirard. No lie! This is just between us? The day before yesterday, around 4:00, I approached a young lady, blonde, rather nice, with some luggage, 2 hatboxes, some packages... - 2 hatboxes? - Yes. She didn't know Paris. She asked if I knew of an hotel that wasn't too expensive. I showed her to an hotel where I'd brought a girl once... - You'd recognize her? - The girl? No. The woman with the hatboxes. What are you asking me? A headless woman? We can show you the luggage. - Will there be photographers? - Four. To photograph your mug. Take him down. Tell him to wait a moment. Chief! - The fat guy's not a photographer? - No. I've identified the suitcase. - It's a salesman's grip... - Slow down. They recognized it. They're going to give us the names of their salesmen. Hello? What? Lost and Found? Be specific! I don't understand. Hello? What? No! Yes, I'm coming. We'll see. Lost and Found has made an arrest. You don't have the right! I'll complain, and that will cost you! I'm telling you. - Take off the handcuffs. - But... - Inspector Maigret. - Delighted. You can go. - Fill me in. - I protest violently! I ask if someone's found a grip I lost, and I'm arrested, they put me in handcuffs! They threaten to strike me. It's a scandal! Here's the grip. Is it yours? Yes, it's mine. There's a cigarette burn on the inside. Look, there. - You're a traveling salesman? - Yes. Salesman for Inox of Paris. Here's my card. Monfils, that's my name. I have a duty to tell you that your grip was used in a crime. I wasn't told that. Well, I'm listening. I was at the Saumur station 2 days ago, waiting for the Nantes train. There was a nervous young woman waiting for the Paris train. She had a bunch of suitcases. When the train arrived, there was a mix-up. She took my grip instead of her suitcase. When I realized, the train was already gone. I made out a baggage claim, and I took the Nantes train. But that doesn't deserve handcuffs, all the same! And what if this is a trick to get you off the hook? And what if I slapped you! Mr. Monfils, do you recognize this woman? - Could you identify her? - Yes. If he apologizes. - Me? - Yes. You put me in handcuffs! You deserved it. I'd love to see it! Calm down. Come now, this is a question of murder. Okay, because you've got a good head on your shoulders. Thank you. Well? It's simple. Here. This is the suitcase she left me with her underwear, and that I've carried everywhere with me. I brought it here to get rid of it. And inside, I found her photo. Here it is. "Gilberte Pardon. The Machepieds, La Rochelle." Pardon... But...I know this name, Chief. Cecile. Cecile Pardon. I know it well. We had the same idea. Amazing! Cecile was right to come. Get your suitcase, and follow me. - We're on our way. - Yes, Chief. - Where is she? - Who? Cecile. Cecile Pardon? Miss Pardon? She's not here? It's impossible. But I don't understand. I haven't budged. Then she must have left. But she insisted on seeing you. Cecile Pardon? Miss Cecile Pardon? This is crazy. She said it was important. - Go get me her card. - Sure thing, Chief. Nicholas? Have you seen a spinsterish woman with a hat and a large purse? - Cecile? - This is no time to joke! - Chief? - What? Chief, it's incredible! "I must see you. "A terrible scene took place last night. "Cecile Pardon." Chief, what's going on? - We're going down there. - Me too? No. You stay here. I've got to see my wife's parents! A word of advice: Turn on the charm! Cecile Pardon? Well! Wait for us. Have you come back about the apartment? - Has Miss Cecile come back? - Come back? I didn't see her leave. The elevator doesn't work. It's six flights up. Come on, hurry! No one's answering. Just my luck. Six floors for nothing. Go get me a locksmith. Yes, Chief. This profession is hard on your feet. - I'll send him up. - You come with him! I'll leave you my body. Are you a burglar? Mind your own business. I won't tell on you. You could go back inside. I'm all alone. It's boring. - Would you like a bite? - No, thank you. Don't put yourself out for me. I'm waiting for reinforcements. Come have a drink while you're waiting. Thanks, Marquise. Why not? You think I'm ugly? No. Badly raised. Not everyone's like you. The guy beneath us, for example, Mr. Dandurand. The Director of Work and Discipline? - Yes. - What a small world. If you wanted, I could go to his place and get some port. He said that he'd get me a bracelet. But I don't want him to. I don't like beards. Don't you want any? Thank you, my child. I'm 16. I'm a young girl. Who deserves a spanking. A spanking? Fat chance! Here we are, Chief. It's not fun, being a locksmith. One time I was called... The husband took a shot, I took a bullet. - I know this lock. - How's that? I made a key for Miss Cecile two days ago. You're not a thief? - You don't know who he is! - Sure I do. A cop! Here you go! - My God! - What is it? There's a light under the bedroom door. Strangled. Finally you're home! Where were you last night? I'll explain it later. What's happened? You're so pale. Don't worry. Here. Did she finally give in? You see? She isn't so mean. Juliette Boynet, 59, born Machepied in Fontenay-le-Comte, Vend?e. Nothing else? Some papers. But not a cent, not one family document. Did she have a bank account? No. And she wouldn't let anyone pay by check. Inspector... You again? I didn't know you were Inspector Maigret. Now you know. - She's a kid. - I'm not talking to you. - She has no respect! - Go on. No. I've got a statement to make. I'm listening. Not in front of her. Will you come to my place? No. Here and no games! In the kitchen, four bottles of bromide. Empty. She must have been put to sleep before she was strangled. What in the devil has happened to Cecile? Let's go look in her room. Her bedroom? They were eating. There were two of them. Still more bromide. What do you think, Chief? Nothing. But I fear for Cecile. Come on! She had something to tell me. Her disappearance is disturbing. - It's your fault! - Ours? If you hadn't laughed at her, this crime wouldn't have happened. - Perhaps two. - Two? Cecile knew her aunt's killer. Why didn't she stay at Headquarters? Perhaps because she's still there. - Where is she? - He'll find her. He's brilliant. He gets hunches. Be quiet! Hello, Nicholas? Maigret here. You must search the offices, everywhere. You've lost something? Eh? Cecile? That again! I'm certain she hasn't left Headquarters! Make me a list of those who've come to Headquarters. Cecile murdered here? Is this a joke? I'm serious. Get moving. - Well? - She was strangled around 1:00. Like Gilberte. No she wasn't. A bad job. The killer wasn't very strong. But the victim was. She was undressing. How do you know? Easy. She'd removed one of her stockings. I'm going. Someone's waiting for me. - I've got some work for you. - But I was going to the Opera. - I'm waiting for something. - A body? No, no. Cecile. Good. Be seeing you. Come here! It's blood! It's blood! Don't touch it. Calm down. All that's left is to find Cecile. Excuse me. I thought somebody forgot to turn the light off. Aren't you up early! We haven't been to bed. This smoke! - I'm going to open the window. - Don't. I'm cold. I'll straighten this up. I'll clean later on. I can't open the closet. - Why's that? - Somebody lost the key. Hello? Yes, Boss. Yes, we're still here. We haven't left. No Cecile anywhere. They've looked everywhere. On the riverbanks... Nothing. I've got an idea. I'll call you back. Let's take a look at your closet. Courage. We're almost there. Strangled, like her aunt. What are you looking for? Her purse. It's gone. You've got the morning off. - Yes, sir. No one touch anything. Let's go over it again. Gilberte Pardon, strangled in a hotel and decapitated to avoid identifying her. An ordinary crime masked as an exceptional one. Papers and money gone. Secondly, her aunt Juliette Boynet, strangled in her flat at night. Papers and money gone. Third, her second niece, Cecile, our Cecile, strangled at Headquarters. Papers and money gone. We haven't kept on the trail of the hotel manager? No. In short, we arrest no one, and the case drags on. I've asked for a list of everyone who came to Headquarters yesterday. Why? Whoever killed Cecile was a familiar figure here. He knew about the tiny corridor and the broom closet. This wasn't the housekeeper. - I suspect everyone. - And the nephew? The evidence points to him. He needed money. He'd fought with his aunt. The day after the crime, he paid his debts. So you've arrested him? No. I think he's innocent. Lock him up immediately! No need to make another judicial error. Hello? Who? Mr. Dandurand? Yes, yes. The same. What? One moment. He's been wounded. A gunshot from your Gerard, who took off. I'm so sorry, Mr. Dandurand. I hope it's not serious. Yes. We'll do whatever's necessary immediately. And there you have it. Your success has gone to your head. You've screwed up. He almost got by with a third crime. I'm going to bed. No. You're going down there. Mr. Dandurand has a statement to make. - Could I see the patient? - Yes. The doctor says it's nothing, with respect. - Not too bad? - Nothing serious. - Doctor, Inspector Maigret. - Enchanted. - And the wound? - In the shoulder. It'll be healed in a week. I need to speak with Mr. Dandurand. It's me who wanted to speak to you. I'll come back tomorrow. Goodbye, Doctor. Doctor, I'd like to show you my leg. I've got a varicose vein, with respect. - Nothing new on Miss Cecile? - No. I'm listening. I was going to find you when I was assaulted by that miserable Gerard. Why? He wanted his aunt's will, which I didn't have. I don't understand. Why would you have the will? Here we are, Inspector. Each family has its secrets, which are incomprehensible. But my duty is to light the way for justice. While waiting, let's put light on the situation. You don't find that a bit harsh? No. I must say I was at Mrs. Boynet's flat the night of the crime, between midnight and 1 a.m. Cigarette? No thanks. I only smoke my pipe. "Between midnight and 1 a.m."? A little before the time she was murdered. What were you doing there? I'd known Mrs. Boynet a very long time. She was born in Fontenay-le-Comte, where I lived. I did business there. I was once her lover. 25 years ago. She was pretty and desirable. Although already of age! We met again in Paris. She was married. We renewed our pleasant relationship. I lived in her house, she became a widow and I became her business advisor. Juliette trusted only me. Did she own other property? Yes. Actually some "houses". You know what I mean. "Houses"? Are you kidding? Special houses? Exactly. In Paris, B?ziers, Lyon, and Toulouse. Mind you, this was no more immoral than making her living on the backs of miners. The Director of Work and Discipline was involved with that? Only as a matter of bookkeeping, Inspector. I went to her flat to do the accounts with her. She must have had... about 800,000 francs in her house. And to think there's guys who'd kill themselves for 2000 francs a month! Excuse me. If I catch you listening at doors again... What will you do to me? Get out of here! Continue. Thank you. Juliette feared scandal. She wanted our relationship to remain secret. So we utilised signals. Like in cheap novels. I'm telling the exact truth. If she wanted to see me, she'd rap on the floor. And if I was free, I'd draw two crosses on the newspaper the concierge brought her every night. And I went up after midnight. The ghost was you? "The ghost"? Your wound is trivial. Could you accompany me upstairs? Why? For a reenactment of these mysterious assignations. This confession hasn't raised me in your estimation. I told you all that because it was my duty. If you think you'll embarrass me, I'm at your mercy. Leave the door open. Guard? I've given your phone number if anyone needs me. Don't let anyone up here. I arrived discreetly around midnight. - You didn't have to ring? - No. She was waiting for me. She wasn't so frail. We went to the parlor. I sat at the table. She sat at her desk. And you did your accounts together. And Cecile? Cecile had stomach problems. Every night, she had an infusion. When I arrived, her aunt was pouring some bromide. We found the bromide and the cup. Could someone have noticed you going up? How's that? Cigarette butts. I put my ashes in an envelope that I took down with me. Cecile never suspected anything. That's where you're wrong. You must know what was in these drawers. We know the killer was looking for something. Juliette was always very discreet. She spoke to me of papers that would damage her. Was that the doorbell? No. My flat. This house has paper walls! That's for me. Wait. Hello? Speaking. Gerard has disappeared, Chief. It's amazing! He hasn't come back. His wife neither. But in her case, for different reasons. She's in the maternity ward. What's going on? Good, order the men to come down. And be quiet a moment. - Mr. Maigret! - What now? - I'd like an autograph. - I don't know how to write. I'll guide your hand. What are you looking for? The money. I believe I've found it. I brought it to her 2 days ago. It was about 817,000 francs. Come here. Come here! And put that there. Sir, don't take it out on an amateur who found what the professionals couldn't. Empty your pockets. - What have I done? - Empty your pockets! If you like. - Empty. - Sit down. It's 11:00. At this hour, I could throw you out. - I'll do nothing, but... - Put your hands on the table. - I don't understand. - I do. Money is fine. But you were looking for something else. The will or these damaging papers you were talking about. Inspector, you have an incredible imagination. No. I heard you walking around. Evidently. But I don't see... The night of the crime, after having left Juliette, you went back downstairs? - Evidently. - You were downstairs? - Yes. Then you heard her being killed. You must have! - So you must know the murderer. - So? Why haven't you said anything? It was her nephew Gerard. No. What do you mean, "no"? He was seen going up. So what! His sister made a key for him. What for? She'd noticed mysterious visits being made. She alerted us. She asked for protection, and we laughed in her face. Her brother came. That's what I said. That night, you must have gone upstairs. Her aunt prepared Cecile's bromide. Just by accident, Gerard drank it and fell asleep. At midnight, you arrived. This time, Cecile heard you. She heard your conversation, she saw your accounts. As soon as you left, she went to her aunt's room. She asked for the money. Not for herself, for her brother. Her aunt refused, took the gun from under her pillow, Cecile lost her head... and that was the scene that night. Dare to say this isn't true. And you heard all that, but you didn't intervene. You heard Cecile looking for the money. She woke her brother, they searched the desk, and they found the will. That's what she brought me yesterday morning. And if it was? Those papers must have been very compromising. That's why a familiar face at HQ strangled Cecile in the closet. Cecile is dead? Don't play innocent. It was you! Mr. Maigret! That is the most false reasoning I have ever heard. But look out, you have no proof! I will though. In the meantime, I'm arresting you! Come in. You asked for me, Judge? - Yes. It seems you're not doing well at all. You insist on creating difficulties for us. - Will you let me explain? - No. Without proof, working on assumptions, on hunches, you arrest an honorable man without even an arrest warrant? But I've got the killer. Everyone accuses the nephew, and you arrest a witness! Who knows people. A press campaign could be unleashed at any moment. I've decided to avoid all of that. I advise you to set Mr. Dandurand free. - We'll see what the boss says. - He won't see you. Meanwhile, Gerard is on the run. The stations have his description. And tonight, he'll be locked up. Since you're so powerful, you can continue without me. - Chief... - Later, later. Here you go, sir. I could arrange a pretty spray for you. Is this for a young lady? - Yes. - For a wedding? - A funeral. To be delivered tomorrow morning. - Yes, sir. - To Paris? - At 10:00 sharp. - The name? - Cecile Pardon. - The address? - The morgue. But of course, ladies. Come in for a moment. Come on in. See Medor, here I am! Are you mad at me? Would you like a glass of brandy? - Emotion gives me heartburn. - It's shaken me up. - Thanks to Old Woman Boynet! - For me, it's Cecile. - A very nice funeral. - Certainly. Such flowers! - They didn't keep her alive. - If only they'd find the killer. To your health, ladies. Mr. Machepied, cousin and heir to Mrs. Boynet. I had an appointment with Maigret. He was at the funeral. He's the one who smoked a pipe in the cemetary, with respect. - Would you like a glass? - Certainly. - Put down your briefcase! - I'd prefer not to. - Here you go. - Thank you. To the deceased. May God keep them! Hello, ladies. Mr. Machepied? Inspector Maigret. Joseph Machepied. Oral surgeon, city councillor, heir of the deceased and litigant. I must speak with the gentleman. - Could you leave us alone a moment? - As you wish, with respect. Then let's go to my flat. I've a bottle of ratafia. - If I need you, I'll pull the cord. - Thank you, Inspector. What's that? Proof that the will is in my favor. Just a moment. I have some questions. Is it true Gilberte lived with you, the youngest of the nieces? Poor girl. A sad end. - So these documents... - Pardon, pardon... Why did Gilberte leave La Rochelle for Paris? She came to ask her aunt for her dowry. I knew that she would refuse. The girl was impulsive. All heart, no head. Sorry. I didn't mean to say that. I've got a whole file of letters, if you'll allow me... - Wait for us in the bistro. - Yes, Mr. Charles. "It is painful for me to live in ingratitude. "Gerard only comes when he wants money. "Thanks for looking after Gilberte. In Paris, she would have ended badly. "As for Cecile, she only loves her brother. "If these three think they'll be in my will, they fool themselves." Word for word. - I'm intruding, perhaps? Not at all. I always regard you with interest. "There's..." - You know each other? - Yes. I'll continue. - If I'm not being too... - No. Mrs. Boynet's letters to her cousin. "There's someone who owes me a lot "and whom I don't trust, but I've taken precautions. "Should something happen to me..." Prophetic words. "Should something happen to me, remember "the present I've given you." - What "present"? - One moment. "They'll be in a bind "when they see I've left you everything." It's there in black and white. We could get an expert. This ends all discussion. You'll inherit a huge fortune. - What would it consist of? - You'll see. Some people would like to see you. They're the business associates of your aunt. They're waiting in the cafe next door. - Let's go. I shook the hands of people at the funeral that I don't know at all. That this be over quickly! We'll leave you alone. Understood. Inspector Maigret. Mr. Machepied, Juliette's heir. Mr. Albert from Paris, Mr. Louis from B?ziers, Mr. Ernest from Toulouse, Mr. Paul from Lyon. Sit down, gentlemen. Your cousin had business in various locations? Some investments with these gentlemen. In La Rochelle, she had nothing. The Great Flame. What do you mean, "The Great Flame"? - But that's an... - Exactly. - That's frightful. - If this money disgusts you, you can give it away. Not at all, not at all. It's on this subject that we wanted you to understand. You know the law isn't concerned with our dealings. It's easy to come to an arrangement. Mr. Charles was an intermediary between Juliette and ourselves. I must tell you Inspector, he has always acted correctly. The investment of your aunt in my house consisted of 3 units. - "3 units?" - 3000 bags. 3 million francs. I never would have imagined it was as much as that? We've decided to hand you the carbon. - "The carbon"? - The bread, the goods. - The dough. - The money! In the Inspector's presence. We want it all done properly. Well, listen, Mr. Albert, I want to think it over. Chief, chief... - Gerard's been arrested. - But we're tracking the culprit! You don't suspect me? He was arrested in La Rochelle. He showed up at a dentist's. Named Marchepied. - At my house? You're Marchepied? "Machepied." What did he want? Your cousin spoke of a present. A present with sentimental value. Gerard didn't love his aunt enough to want her portrait. - It's of her? - She had it made when she was young. - Is there a La Rochelle train? - Not before tonight. My car is at your disposal, Inspector. I willingly accept. Will you allow me to go with you? - I was going to ask you. - I want to prove my innocence! - Am I going with you? - No. Go to Headquarters, and come back with a list of everyone who came yesterday. Without a car, I won't be back before tonight. You'll jump on a motorcycle, and you'll join me. "On a motorcycle"? You want another corpse? - There's no gas. - But I've got 5 liters left! Are you sure it isn't something else? This isn't my thing. Whenever I have a problem, the garage takes care of it. This can't be a big deal. Look in the gas tank. Ouch, I got zapped! I'll take a look. Put up your hands. Put up your hands! Don't move. - Where did you get that gun? - Under the hood. - Well done. - Hey! Oh, don't worry. It's only my pipe. Get back, Inspector. You too, dentist! I'll get you, Mr. Dandurand. You've got lots of imagination, but no proof. It's a question of the minor. That's it! - I find this funny. - You find this funny, huh? Well, yes. All that's left is for us to walk to La Rochelle. Oh, no! It's 25 kilometers. Stop! What is it? Police. We've done nothing! I'm requisitioning your bicycle. You can get it in La Rochelle. - Can you prove who you are? - Here you go. Aren't you Inspector Maigret? My goodness... Pleased to meet you. Isn't fame glorious? - You know how to ride a bike? - It's how I keep in shape. You'll ride in back then, and do all the work. - Are you ready? - Yes. Then off we go! And us? How do we get back? You wanted to go camping. You got your wish! - When will he be back? - He's due back this afternoon. That must be him. Police! - Are you alone? - There's only one patient. Mr. Machepied is in Paris attending a funeral. - Are you the one who was attacked? - Yes. I didn't allow it. I cried out. He was arrested immediately. Very good! You did your duty. I congratulate you. - What's your name? - Irene. Oh, let me go! What's he doing? Let me go! Help! Help! As soon as we find the portrait, we need to get out of here. Impossible to find it. Where could he have put it? We shouldn't have put her to sleep. You only have to wake her up. Hey, little mouse! Everyone's come down, we're here! Come on, Miss. Miss... Wake up! You gave her too much. Hey! Hey! Come on, Miss. Irene! What a strange way to travel. I'll explain it all later. Come on. As fast as we can. - And me? - You've got to pedal! Where do you think the portrait is? I think that's what Dandurand is afraid of. Gilberte must have discovered the secret by accident. She came to Paris to make her aunt talk. But why cut her head off? To cover the crime as something extraordinary. And the name on the mirror? She wrote her sister's name when she knew she would die. You have the list? - Yes, Chief. There's Mr. Albert at the top. Then let's get going! Your bike doesn't go very fast. You'll make me break my neck. If that isn't true, you'll pay. She told the truth. Where I never would have looked. - That's Juliette? - Yes. What a change! The papers aren't here. - Where are they? - What? - The papers. - What are you talking about? That makes 4 days I've been here. I've had enough of this place. It's the niece that would have found them. - Where's your room? - Up there. Gilberte's old room? Yes. Her things are still there. The papers too. Come with me. Is she coming with us? No. Put her out again. Oh no, not again! I won't let you! Help! Help! Mr. Charles, I'm doing this for you. Not in here. Nor there. - Here. - Put up your hands! Lucas, Mr. Albert must have had two guns: His and mine. Mr. Dandurand doesn't like guns. He prefers to strangle or decapitate, depending on the case. Always failing, aren't you? You too, Inspector. Mr. Dandurand, you've committed two crimes for nothing. Gilberte didn't take those infamous papers to Paris, so Cecile wouldn't have had them when she came to Headquarters. So i thought... that Gilberte hadn't left them in the portrait. Instead of looking for the portrait, we came here. The Chief is a genius! - But you found nothing. - I was waiting for you. Gilberte loved film stars. In her room, there were lots of photos. So... There they are. Somebody in La Rochelle wants to talk to you. Hello? What? Is that you, Maigret? - You want Gerard released? - But I'm formally opposed to it! Have you had Mr. Dandurand arrested again? Oh, this is an obsession! What? Do you have proof? But that's incredible! Will you allow me? Hello? Hello, Maigret. Well, what? You've got the killer? Oh, I was sure of your hunches. Come back as soon as you can. My counterfeiters are waiting. Yes. And again, congratulations. Thanks, Boss. Where did you find him? - He tried to enter the building. Remove those handcuffs. You can leave. Thank you, gentlemen. Well Pardon, you are free. Sit down. I must know what you were doing on the night of the murder. Will you allow me to begin? You went up to see your sister, you were thirsty, and you drank her bromide. In the middle of the night, I was suddenly woken by Cecile. "I'm going to kill our aunt", she told me. She was trembling. - Continue, continue. We rummaged through the desk, found thousands in cash, a will in favor of Mr. Machepied and an envelope labeled, "In case anything happens to me". We opened it. It said that documents damaging to Mr. Dandurand were with her cousin Machepied. Cecile went to give herself up and took the papers. I'll never forgive him. For Cecile's sake, I'll keep to the facts. - Listen to me. - One moment. - And you, Mr. Albert? - This isn't my concern. I've... I came to Headquarters, summoned by the Inspector, and I met Mr. Dandurand. Who followed Cecile because he thought she had evidence! What an imagination! I congratulate you. You have the astonishing gifts of a novelist. I know your future. It isn't so bright. Continue, Mr. Albert. He showed me Cecile, and told me to tell you that you were asking for her and to bring her into the corridor. The claims of a seedy manager. "Seedy"? I'd advise you to stop talking! This is all I've done. You make an institution out of lying. All that remains is to explain your wound. He summoned me. I wanted to make you confess... He tried to kill me, and got hurt! But he attacked me and I got wounded! Continue. Seeing I was a suspect, I came to look for the documents. I won't say another word without my lawyer present. My God, what a day! What have I done? A man of my age. There's the dentist. I've never seen so many people in my house. - You've arrived just in time. - In time and on foot! I've died twice, I'll be dead for two months. You've found the portrait? - I've done better than that. A love letter addressed to Juliette from her lover. Juliette had a lover? I've never heard the like! This is an abuse of power. You're intruding on private concerns! Shut up and listen. "We'll soon be delivered. "In several weeks, we'll finally be at peace. "Your husband suspects nothing. Patience. "It would be better if we didn't see each other in the days to come." - Lucas! - Yes, Chief. One moment, smart guy. - You'll allow me? - This is intolerable! Plus you. It's solid. "It'll take two weeks at the most. "I love you. Your big bear, Charles." Well, Big Bear Charles is the good Mr. Dandurand. With the aid of Mrs. Boynet, you poisoned her husband. And you don't bother denying it. With an autopsy, we'll find arsenic. A call from Paris. - What is it? - Good news! The gentleman has a daughter. Congratulations. You should name her Cecile. In these circumstances, I'm going to buy some candy. Because it's for happiness... the family... Formidable! Okay, okay, okay!...
