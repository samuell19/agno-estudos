(INAUDIBLE) (TURNS ON SPEAKER) Hi. I'm looking for Five. Missed it. I know that. Do you have any wiper blades? No. Look, please don't turn me off again. I'm heading down to L.A. and I've got a map in my car. I just don't know where I am. Turn around, mile down the road, hang a right. (TURNS OFF SPEAKER) (INAUDIBLE) (PEOPLE CHATTERING) Um, I'll have the hamburger deluxe, rare. And an iced tea, please. MAN: Let's stop arguing and fighting. GIRL: I can't wait to see my friends. MAN: Well, try to enjoy what's next. That's the reason we're on the trip. It's the reason we spent all that money, to buy the mobile home to begin with. I don't like those loud music tapes that you play all the time. God, you always want to listen to boring... Will you explain to her that this is a democracy? (ENGINE STARTING) TREY: Get a ride? Hi. (TIRE RATTLING) TREY: You've got a problem. I can fix a flat. So can I. (SIGHS) This doesn't mean I'm giving you a ride. Well, it looks like you got air in it. Well, do I owe you anything? I don't guess so. Okay. Well... Thanks for your help. (ENGINE STARTING) I'm not going any further than you are. (SIGHS) Get in. I don't pick up hitchhikers. Uh-huh. I can use the company to stay awake. I can drive. I feel funny about other people driving my car. I'm headed down to L.A. I'm stopping for the night, though. I'm a designer. Women's fashions. I bet you're real good. Look, I'm Julia Robbins. You got a name or something? Sure. Trey. Trey. JULIA: That's an odd name. TREY: I guess so. Well, if you're still around in the morning, you've got a ride as far as L.A. (CHATTERING ON TV) ...city's experiment with rent control. Lower rents have handed a big break to residents here. But developers say that new apartment... MAN: Wait a minute, we're under attack! It's coming after us! WOMAN: ...will help discover... (KNOCKING AT DOOR) Hi. It's kind of wet out there. I was wondering if maybe I could sleep in your car. You fix TVs, too? JULIA: Good hands. I have a question first. The flat, did you do it? No. You're lying. I never lie. (SIGHS) I don't care. No, leave it on. No! No words. If there aren't any words, it'll be like it never happened. Hi. My grandfather gave it to me when I was a little girl. It's a hundred years old. He said it would protect me. As long as it kept ticking, nothing could hurt me. He believed it. Sounds like a nice guy. (LAUGHS) He was crazy. When I was a girl we used to go for drives Sunday morning. I'd get all dressed up. I would just sit in the back, looking out the window for horses. I liked the motion, the illusion of getting somewhere. We never stopped till we got back home. I like this car. (SIGHS) Good hands. (ROCK MUSIC PLAYING) (CLEARS THROAT) I come here sometimes. I don't know why. Look, I better get going. I've got a presentation to get in order. Well, I'll see you later. I don't think that would be a very good idea. Why? I lead a very simple life. So do I. (LAUGHS) For me, right now, you would be a major complication. I'm not very complicated. (SIGHS) I think I liked this better when there were no words. Well, thank you. It was very nice of you to help me with my car. I'll see you. (ENGINE STARTING) Bye. (CAT MEOWING) Oh! Hi, Steve. Here you go, baby. Come here. Hi. Miss me? (CLANKING) Don't move. Pull down your pants. I beg your pardon? I want to see if I should shoot it off or suck it. My vote count? (CHUCKLES) Hi. Hi. Without bullets, it's just a toy. Ah, I'd never be able to use it anyway. Yes, you would. How'd it go? Well, I think I might have sold them on my spring line. Terrific! Yeah. You make the girls beautiful, I'll free my boy, we'll have a double celebration. Okay. Pick your favorite color of champagne. Mmm, I like pink Champagne and white roses. So, what are you doing here, anyway? (SIGHS) Thought you'd be back. I got hung up. You due back? No. Stan's preparing the motion. I'm working on the psych. The Munroe case. What else is there in my life? Hmm? Now, what was that about pulling down my pants? (GIGGLING) Let me go shower off some of this road dust first. Okay? (SHOWER RUNNING) (MOANING) I love you. I can feel it. (BOTH GIGGLING) Can you? Mmm-hmm. I love you. (PHONE RINGING) It doesn't matter. Doesn't matter. No. You were right. I like the length much better that way. Yeah. Look, you think that... (KNOCKING AT DOOR) Oh! Oh, I'm sorry. Am I early? No. I'm late. MATTY: Oh! JULIA: Thanks, Gene. Thanks. Hi. Hi. So, come on. Let's go. Thank you. So. Life is perfect. I'm pregnant! No! Yes! (SIGHS) I still can't believe it myself. When did you find out? Yesterday, for sure. But you know, I had a feeling, because I'm never late. What about David? Yeah, he wants it, too. Oh, Matty, I'm so happy for you! Oh, God, I'm sorry. That's okay. Oh, God. You know, I haven't even told my mother yet. She'll die. We're having a wedding. (BOTH EXCLAIMING) Isn't that great? Nothing big, but the real thing. I'll design your gown. (SIGHS) Oh! So, your first godchild. You know, you're next, you know. Oh, well. What's wrong? Nothing. You sure? Mmm-hmm. Good, because I want us both to be happy. You know, like those stupid dreams we had when we were kids? I want us to live in identical houses next door to each other. I mean, the most boring shit you can imagine, like Levittown. Nothing to do but feed the brats and watch game shows. (LAUGHING) I mean it! Well, cheers. I want everything. Thanks. What do you have that's chocolate? (LAUGHS) (PHONE RINGING) (DOORKNOB RATTLING) Hello. Hello? (PHONE RINGING) Hello. MAN: Hiya, Julia. Who's this? Trey? Hi. I didn't give you my number. Doesn't matter. Listen, I don't think you should be calling me. Why not? (SIGHS) Did you just call a minute ago? No. Listen, can I come over? That wouldn't be a very good idea. Idea? Look, no, you shouldn't come over. I just can't see you right now. I can wait. Yeah, um, look, I don't know. Is there some way that I can reach you? I'll reach you. Bye, Julia. Yeah. Bye. (PHONE RINGING) WOMAN ON TV: ...standing in a nine-foot river. John? MAN ON TV: A Southern California woman today became the winner of California's largest lottery. Erica Taylor, a bartender from Loma Linda, cashed in her ticket for... (PHONE RINGING) Yeah, Carrie. TREY: Hello, Julia. How did you get my number here? Why don't we get together today? Oh, I'm sorry. I'll come back later. No, Gene, it's okay. (SIGHS) What do you want from me? I want to see you, Julia. Okay. All right, I'll see you. Right now. You tell me where. (PEOPLE CHATTERING) JAWBONE: Hey, we got some time. Nothing but time. Are you waiting for somebody? Or something? Fuck off. TREY: Hi. Hey, Jawbone! You got any bread, man? Want to go someplace else? No. Here. Let's talk. Okay. You hungry? No. Are you? (CLEARS THROAT) Look, what happened was what I wanted to happen. I never did anything like that before. I guess I needed to. But this has to stop, calling me all the time. We made love. Is that what you needed? I'm not apologizing to anyone. I needed... Wanted to be with someone. "Someone." Yes, God damn it, someone. And now I don't want to be with you. Jesus, something happened, and... "Happened." You keep saying "happened." And I won't apologize for it. Look, I have to be getting back to the office. You can't just make love to someone and go back to the office. Were you in the war or something? We should be together. There's someone else in my life, Trey. But you made love to me. We didn't make love. We fucked, okay? What's the difference? This conversation doesn't seem to be getting anywhere. Julia. I have appointments all afternoon. He doesn't exist any longer. What are you saying? We should be together, Julia. You're crazy. He can't protect you. Please, don't call me again. I did something really dumb. I screwed up really bad, Matty. What? Work? I met someone. You? No. I don't believe it. Oh, God! I am such a jerk. I can't believe this! What, on the trip? On the way back. I picked up a hitchhiker. A hitcher! We spent a night together. Does Arthur know? (GASPS) Oh! Of course he doesn't know. Oh, good. I thought I could handle it, but he... (SIGHS) He keeps calling. No! Well? What's he like? Well, he's different. (BOTH LAUGHING) We'll go over here. Oh, God. Different? How? Well, for one thing, he's fucking crazy. (EXCLAIMS) Oh, God, I don't believe this. That's the third time I've cursed today. I don't usually do that. Wow! Oh, Matty, what am I gonna do? (SIGHS) (EXHALES) You know, I think he could be dangerous. What would Arthur do if he found out? I don't know. Well, has he ever, uh... Near as I can figure, 13. His lucky number. You'd think a lawyer would make a better liar. And you didn't care? Not as much as I do now. I had this dream last night. You know, one of those dreams where you're being followed by someone? I knew he wanted to kill me. I tried running, but I couldn't get away from him. And then there was a gun in my hand. I shot him dead through the heart, but he got up. I kept killing him over and over again and he kept getting up and coming after me. I think it was him, Matty. (PHONE RINGING) Yeah, Carrie. CARRIE: Julia, there's a man here who says he wants to see you. He doesn't have an appointment. He says his name is Trey. Oh, no. (DOORKNOB CLICKS) Should I send him in? Hi, Julia. Julia, I'm sorry. He just... Get out of here! Do you want me to call security? Well, it's not that easy, is it? There is no security. Carrie. What's wrong? We're connected, Julia. Oh, my God! When you make love with someone, it's a forever thing. Hey, listen. I don't know who you are, and I don't know what you're doing here... I knew it from the first time I saw you. EUGENE: Now, look, mister... I'm gonna call the police. So did you. Oh, God! TREY: Come with me, Julia. EUGENE: Hey, why don't you just... Come with me, Julia. I am really calling the police. No, Carrie. No. It's your decision. You always know where I am. Oh, God! Are you okay, honey? Yeah. Here. No, thanks. I'm all right. (BREATHING HEAVILY) (RETCHING) Oh, my God! Oh, Jesus. (TOILET FLUSHING) (COUGHING) (PIANO MUSIC PLAYING) So, some excitement today? Well, weren't you closing in on the new spring line? Oh. Gene's hoping by Friday. Well, looks like we've got them over a barrel on that warrant. With a little luck, Mr. Munroe will be free to rape, pillage and plunder by the weekend. (CHUCKLES) That's not very funny. Hey, will you lighten up? That's a joke. You know how I feel about that bastard. I'm sorry. I know. What's eating you? Nothing. Are you sure? You know, I wish... I wish we could just get away. Just go someplace, like we used to. What makes you think we can't? (CHUCKLES) God, Arthur, that would be so... ARTHUR: Julia. (IN SING SONG TONE) What is it? I'd like to. I would... I'd like to just run off somewhere with you. (PHONE DIALING) (PHONE RECEIVER CLICKS) (PHONE DIALING) (PHONE RINGING) OPERATOR: Hollywood Division. JULIA: Detectives desk, please. Yeah. Morrison. JULIA: Yes. Hi. I want to know what I can do to prevent someone from bothering me? A man. He's been following me and he also keeps calling. Has this guy threatened you? No. Well, I don't know. He said we would be together. Uh, yeah. You know this guy? Uh, no. Yes. He's someone I met. You told him you didn't want to see him anymore? Well, he's kind of hard to talk to. Look, I just want him to stop. Well, you can go down to the criminal court building and get a judge to file a restraining order against this guy. Criminal court building? No, I can't. I... I can't go down there. Do you want me to send a car by and pick you up? (STUTTERS) No. No, I... I can't. I really can't do that. Look, then there's nothing I can do. No, that's okay. You're right. You can't do anything. I'm sorry I called. Look, if you want me to... No. Forget it. I'm sorry. (SIGHS) Remember that little place we stayed in by the beach? I think it was the first time we came here. WOMAN: Oh! Is this where it is? MAN: Yeah. I want you to see this building. (MAN CONTINUES CHATTERING) Hey. You're not wearing your watch. I stopped. It stopped. Guess your grandfather was wrong. (CHUCKLES) I guess so. (BELL TOLLING) ARTHUR: I've gone over it in my head a hundred times. Goddamn burglary, that's all it should have been. He got angry because there was less there than he'd expected. In his way of looking at things, they'd cheated him. (SCOFFS) He had the kids totally at his mercy. The parents were dead, he could take his time. He decided he wanted to see what glass would do to skin, so he broke some bottles. Stop. Stop. (SIGHS) Yeah. Let's get married. Yes. No, you're right. We really should. I need to be protected. You've never told me that before. KRIGER: Same gentleman. ARTHUR: From the motel? Would you prefer it if it were a different one? He may be the first. For how long? She picked him up hitchhiking on the way back from San Francisco. A hitchhiker. Jesus. Lord works in mysterious ways. Mysterious ways. MAN: Excuse me. Sorry I frightened you, but I think you've got a flat tire. (SIREN WAILING) (PEOPLE CHATTERING) Hey, check it out. (PANTING) (MEOWING) Oh, God. MORRISON: What makes you so sure this guy's following you? JULIA: I know he is. He came to my office. There were other people around? (LAUGHS) Of course there were other people. He was there in front of the whole office. Uh, I gotta ask this shit. Um, you want one of these? They're good. It's cherry. I hate the black. You work undercover a lot? (LAUGHS) Every cop's a criminal. Yeah. And all the sinners, saints. On the phone you said this guy didn't threaten you. No. Well, I... You couldn't say he did. No. When did it start? Julia, I can't help if you don't tell me everything. I know him, sort of. I picked him up hitchhiking. God, I feel like such an idiot, picking up a stranger, Jesus! I had a flat on the road and he helped me out. At least I thought he did. Now I know he set me up. He did the same thing tonight. I think he's crazy. I... Did he give you a name? Trey. That's all he said. Look, I just want him to stop, that's all. I just want him to go away. (POLICE SIRENS WAILING) (KEYBOARD KEYS CLACKING) (DOORBELL RINGING) You wanna get drunk? Yeah, I was just in the neighborhood and there was this liquor store and here was your house, so I figured, what the hell. Are you drunk? Sober as a church mouse. You can check the seal. Untampered, pure, virgin seal. You know, I have a lot of work to do tonight... I am acquainted with every facet of your life. You want to make love? Liquor's quicker. I would hate to think that some poor criminal's gonna have to go to jail because of this. I'm almost finished with the briefs for tomorrow's motion. Why don't you do them in your briefs? I'll help. You'll help? You'd be surprised. Let the bastard hang. (PHONE RINGING) Hello. MATTY: (CRYING) Julia? I need to see you. (MATTY CRYING) Hi. Hey, what is it? We had a fight. Major. About the baby? No. Yes. You know, he says it isn't... Look, let's walk, okay? I don't know. All of a sudden, you know, he's having second thoughts. (CLICKING TONGUE) Oh! He says he's not ready! Oh, God! You know, I'd like to just string him up by his balls. (BOTH LAUGHING) Not really. You know, like he gives two shits about his career. Oh. I'm having this baby, Julia. Of course you are. Well, anyway, I'm not going back there tonight. I just... I can't go back. No, you're not. You still have the key to my place? (BOTH LAUGHING) Yeah. Well, good! Good. Then we'll have a pajama party, okay? Okay. I'll come home and we'll fry up some fish. Oh, great. Thank you, Julia. You're always there for me. You know, this just goes to prove this theory that I have that, uh, you know, things, given long enough, will always get fucked up. (CRYING) Thank you. God... (PHONE RINGING) Jennings and Brady. Hello? (CLOCK TICKING) (LOUD TICKING) Tell me. KRIGER: (ON PHONE) He's nobody. He doesn't exist. What is that supposed to mean? I've shown his picture in every off-the-map dive and local lockup from here up to Oakland. Can't even come up with a name. What does that tell you? It could be anybody. I mean, a small-time loser, a psycho from the war, a draft dodger who didn't make it home for the amnesty. This country's full of them. Drifters. Part of our heritage, you might say. Civilization just doesn't quite take on everybody, Artie. Isn't that something? Come on now, Arthur. We both know who we're talking about. I find them and you defend them. A kind of symmetry in that, don't you agree? So what the hell is your point? Only that he came from nowhere and he's headed nowhere. Kind of a decent metaphor for us all, don't you think? You're an asshole, Kriger. Let's be more specific, Arthur. I'm your asshole. (TIRES SCREECHING) (MEOWING) Uh-uh. That's not for you, Steve. Yours is coming right up. (PHONE RINGING) Okay. Hello? ARTHUR: (ON PHONE) Julia, hi. Listen, I need to see you. Tonight. l... l don't know about tonight, Arthur. Matty's coming over. We need to talk, Julia. Um, okay, well, maybe later. Um, I'll give you a call. Are you all right? Sure. Yeah. I'll see you. Yeah, I'll see you. Bye. Matty? You asleep? Matty! Oh, God! (PHONE RINGING) I just... I just stood there, trying to figure out... Something that made sense. The blood wasn't blood. She'd had a drink in bed and spilled it all over everything. Clumsy girl. Then she'd fallen asleep. God, the crazy things you tell yourself. Julia, you mentioned that Matty had a fight with her boyfriend. Yeah, but it was... It was nothing. You know, they were just... Oh, God! She was pregnant. Julia, at this point, it's just important that we find out as much as we can about everything. I told you who it was! It was Trey. He's sick. How can you be certain it's him? Because I know! What reason would this man have to hurt you, Julia? Because he's crazy! What kind of reasons does he need? Even crazy people have reasons. They just have crazy reasons. You said he's called. What does he say on the phone? Sometimes he doesn't say anything, he's just there. Then how do you know it's him? I know, God damn it! (SIGHS) Today the phone rang in the office. I picked it up. He didn't say anything. Then there was this ticking. It was a pocket watch. An old, gold pocket watch. How do you know that, Julia? Because I gave it to him. I was so stupid. I never did anything like that before. He was just someone, no one, and... I slept with him. That time on the road? EDWARDS: What is it, Julia? I just remembered something he said. He said that when you made love, you were connected forever. That it was a forever thing. Oh, thank God! (CRYING) I just heard. They called me at the office. Come on, sweetheart, I'll take you home. I'm not going back there! Shh. No, no, no. Of course not. I meant my place. (CLEARING THROAT) You have to catch him! You don't know how dangerous he is. You want me to make some coffee? MAN: (ON TV) So this was a different kind of a role for you, apparently? WOMAN: (ON TV) Yes, it was. It was nice to be able to do something totally different from my other parts. (KEYBOARD KEYS CLACKING) (RAIN PATTERING) (BIRDS CHIRPING) (SIGHS) You're one cop I don't know. Did you know your lawyer was indirectly involved in a murder? This time I have an airtight alibi. Doesn't mean you don't know anybody on the outside, does it? Hey, look, I... I'm sorry about what happened with Art and all. He's a good guy. Really. I guess what I really need to know is... What does it feel like? Damned if I know. Except the first one, maybe. I mean, that's the only one that counts. After that, it's... Nothing. Very vague like. With the first one, you... You feel something let go. Something just slip away like... Like the soul of the guy slipping out in front of you. It's weird, it's... It's not a very strong feeling. I mean, there's no hate or anything, not while you're doing it. I didn't want to kill those people. I mean, it just happened. I was angry, and they were there. I wish I could say I was sorry. Really. But then, who would I say it to? There's nobody left in that family. Ever hear of a guy named Trey, Willie? Trey? No. I can't say as I have. Hey, man. Art's a hell of a lawyer. I'll see you out on the streets, okay? (DOOR CLOSING) Where have you been? I was worried. At the beach. The beach? It rained today. The beach is still there in the rain. I'm making you a drink. I need one, too. (SCOFFS) Drink them both. You know, I can't quite figure out if you're angry at me because you know that I know, or you're angry at yourself for what you did, and I'm just getting the spillover. (SIGHS) So... Yes. How'd you find out? I found out. How long have you known? Oh, pretty early on. Can you forgive me? We've both made some mistakes. We have to start knowing each other again. Yes. I love you, Julia. Are you okay? Yes. Oh, I'd like to kill him. Oh, so would I. (CLICKING TONGUE) I... Need to get away just now. I'm sorry. I just have to be by myself. Just for a little while. Please don't go. No. I need to be by myself. Then me. I'll... I'll go. No. It's not safe. I just need to get away. I'm sorry. (DOOR CLOSING) (PHONE RINGING) Hello. (CLOCK TICKING) (TICKING STOPS) You bastard. So you know where I am. Well, I can find you, too. (GASPING) Don't move. Who are you? Oh, Jesus Christ, I live here. Do you have some ID? Who the hell are you? Joe Santini. Homicide. Oh. Easy. Easy. They told me you wouldn't be here. Oh, I... l just needed a few things. (SIGHING) I'm sorry if I scared you. Yeah. (UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING) (PEOPLE CHATTERING) Hey, babe. That's my car. That's cool. Yeah. Join the party, honey. Get the fuck away from my car! Ease off, sweetheart. (CAR DOOR CLOSING) (SOBBING) (LAUGHING) Oh. Yeah, it's probably nothing, Joe. Thanks for calling it in. (TOY WINDING) (PHONE RINGING) (DOG BARKING) (KNOCKING AT DOOR) JULIA: Who is it? Arthur? (FAINT TICKING) (LOUD TICKING) Oh! Damn you! Damn you! Hi. You don't know me, but I know you. I know, you're probably wondering about the feathers. It's a homemade silencer. Works pretty well, but what a mess. (GRUNTS) (LAMP SHATTERING) (LAUGHING) You're really gonna have a terrible time, Julia. Why? Look at this, you fucking cunt. Look at what you did! You couldn't keep your fucking cunt where it belonged? Who are you? That is an interesting question, Julia. See, Julia, I am the man who does it. (WHIMPERS) The man who acts. I plug your holes, I kill your cockroaches, and I watch your wife being fucked by other men. I know everything about you, Julia. Tick-tock, tick-tock. Does that make me your best friend? Why? Why? (LAUGHS) But, Julia, haven't you figured this out yet? He fucked around, so he figured you were, too. Law of nature. Arthur hired you? He forgave you, you know. I mean, there's the 20th century for you. He should've cut your fucking heart out! And saved me the trouble. But he's just preparing his case. What? You killed Matty. Oh, yes. The bitch. I really wish that I could say that I was sorry. Came to your house, just about my business. No one was supposed to be there. She was there. Just kind of happened, you might say. She had a right to scream. Once she was dead, though, everybody had to die, because, alas, one misunderstanding leads to another. And Boyfriend figured it all out. Did not take it well, I might add. You know, you'd think that somebody in his profession would be a little bit more tolerant. (GRUNTS) Oh, Jesus. Jesus can't save you now, darlin'. I'm god of this universe. This is a really nice place. Yes, Boyfriend was quite civilized. Excellent manners, I might add. You know, this has all really been over nothing. Just a tumbling in the night. A filthy couple, trying to keep up pretense, but sensing the other side. I'm from the other side, Julia. Men like Boyfriend have sent me there so often to do their work that I've become a naturalized citizen. But you know, I always try to find the good in unpleasant experiences. I read that once in Reader's Digest. Bullets for the gents, the blade for the ladies. (SCREAMS) Shut your filthy mouth. (DOOR CREAKING) You unfaithful bitch! See how easy that was? Perfect! Fucking perfect! Your gun! Because do you know what I think happened? I think our friend back there developed a fixation on you. A one-night stand with a fatal flaw. He didn't know how to take no for an answer. That's what you've been telling the police, isn't it? Are you following me so far? He went to your house looking for you, but he found Girlfriend. My, my. So he came here, and he kills Boyfriend, and cuts open your throat and leaves you for dead. But (LAUGHS) and here is the gimmick... You had enough life left in you to put a single bullet right through his heart. And now we have all the time in the world. Would you like a candy? KRIGER: Now, that just leaves you and me, doesn't it? Have you noticed, but your conversation seems to be lagging? Oh, yes, that's right. I've heard this! You don't really quite believe this is happening, do you? You might seem to be experiencing it from a distance. Sound familiar? Or like it's happening to someone else? (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) I've heard that's what happens. (METALLIC CLANGING) It's a kind of shock. It's really quite common among victims of violent crime. How the brain protects its vessel. By the way, did you notice Arthur's brains upstairs? It's really quite a messy organ, don't you think? So, of course this can't really be happening to you. That creates a bit of a problem. (CREAKING) Because, you see, I want this to be happening to you. I want you to feel every cut. So... Why don't we have a little fun? What do you say? (SIGHS) Let's see... Ah, yes. (WHISPERING) How about a little wakeup call for starters? What do you think about a little souvenir of tonight? How about an ear? Or a nose? Who would miss it? No. Oh, God! Come on, Julia. Vanity at this late stage? I came to expect more from you. Please. (LAUGHS) Julia, do you think I'm a man with whom begging for mercy would do any good? I'm the man who acts. I am the most dangerous man you will ever fucking meet. (SIGHS) (SCREAMING) (SCREAMING CONTINUES) Please, no... Who are you? (GRUNTING) (GLASS SHATTERING) (GLASS SHATTERING) TREY: The most dangerous man you will ever meet. (CAR APPROACHING) No!
