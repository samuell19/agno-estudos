Boudreaux's Auto and Truck. [Lenny] Whoo. Hands on people, hands on. It is that time of year again where we get 20 people to stand around a truck with one hand on it for as long as they can, day and night, 'til the last person standing with their hand on it, mind you, wins that truck. Now, I'm excited to have this young lady here join us in the studio today. This is Joan Riley. Now, she does PR down at Boudreaux's. She also has been organized in this contest for-- -Is this the 10th year, Jo? -Yes, it is. 10th year. My goodness gracious. I gotta ask you. I explained this contest to people and it sounds pretty straightforward, but it is no easy piece of cake to win this truck. Exactly. It's-- it's gonna be a tough one. But we got some strong contestants, so it's-- it's-- it's gonna be awesome. Yeah. [Lenny] I'll bet it is. All right. I want to ask you about how you go and select those contestants every year. Sure, uh, well we place these little boxes in different places all around town and then anyone wanting to take part just writes their name on a slip of paper and drops it in the box. And then we had four draws, one each weekend and each time, five people were drawn. Sunday was the last one. Oh, Joan. Now, don't you give it away. -That's my job. -Okay. You're right, Sunday was the last one, but if I'm not mistaken, only three people were drawn on Sunday? -Exactly. -That is right. Ladies and gentlemen, we got a little treat for you. We're gonna draw the last two names live right here in the KNXP Studios. Joan, will you do the honors? I know you know how to spin that thing. Oh, it'd be my pleasure. Let's see who she pulls out of there. -Okay. Ready? -[Lenny] Yes, ma'am. Good luck, y'all. [cell phone vibrates] Hi, baby. What's up? No! Nuh-uh, nah, you're messing with me. You're not playing? On TV? -That's-- that's crazy, huh? -[car honking] I can't believe it either, baby. -[car honking] -Finally. All right, I love you. I love you too, Kyle. Now, where's my fucking root beer? [Kyle] I'll get it. -You want anything? -No, no thanks. Everything okay with you? [Kyle] Can I take your order please? Hey, Kyle, how you doing, sugar? [Kyle] Good, Ms. Riley. I'm gonna clock out here in a few. I, uh, I guess you probably heard the-- What happened. Yes, sir, I do know that and I bet you're feeling mighty fine. -[Kyle] Yeah. -Isn't it amazing? It's so great that you got drawn, Kyle. I'm so happy for you. [Kyle] Yeah, I just got the news. Maria called me. Uh, now listen up, Kyle. Actually, you'd better write this down. No sugar, no fatty foods, but lots of water and bananas. Maybe an orange every now and again, but you don't want too much acid on your stomach. Okay? You listening to me? But the most important thing is drink, drink, drink. Water, Gatorade, some coffee is okay, but none of that sweet stuff. You got it? [Kyle] Okay, well thanks for the advice. -You got it. -[Kyle] Um, what would you like to order? Oh, um, I'll have the fried shrimp and a large diet coke. -[Kyle] You got it. -Oh, shoot, you know what? Make that a shake. XL.

[car honking] [Joan] So, ready for round two? [Chris] [sighs] No. Can we talk for a minute? Uh, sure. I, uh, hope it's not about popping the question or the L word or something. No, um, I met someone. -[Joan] Ah. -Yeah. Yeah, so? [Chris] She's pretty serious about us. Oh. Well, that's fantastic. So, what do you say? Ready for round two? [Chris] Well, she wants a serious, committed relationship, you get it? And we can't do this. Actually, I-- I've been trying to think about how or if I was even gonna, uh, but, uh, I know like it-- Like today when-- I mean-- I mean you always said we-- we were just-- That was a joke, Chris. -[Chris] Okay. -That's great news, hon.

Where'd you get that snow cone? [Martha] The nice young man in there. You reckon he might be interested? [Joan] Could be, could be. I don't think so though. Here we go. [Martha] You never can tell, huh? [Joan] Yep. That's right, you never can tell. -What's this? -This is a truck, Mama. No shit, I'm not an idiot. I know that, but I gotta get back to the dealership. -[exhales] -Here, give me the snow cone. Mama.

They followed her, supposing she was going to the tomb to mourn him." [Brian giggling] -[contestants chuckling] -[Ruthie praying] What? [Ruthie chuckling] Stop.

[Joan] He just fell, he just went crashing down. -Walt? -I don't know. Is it Walter? [Chris] Don't know anybody. You all right? -[Chris] You all right? [Joan] Just call 911. [Chris] Okay, Yeah, yeah, yeah. Is he breathing? All right, buddy, we're calling 911 for you. [woman] Somebody do something. Hey, we're at Boudreaux's 26th and Shanklin Hands On contest and we got a dude that just straight fell out. [Ronny] Walter. [man] Walter. Talk to me, buddy. Uh, he's on the pavement in front of the truck. Yeah, he's breathing. He's just not waking up. He'd been up for, like, two days. -Walter? -He never took a break. Are you sending somebody? [Joan] His eyes are opening now. [Bubba] All right, his eyes are open now. -Walter? -[Bubba] Okay, thank you, ma'am. -Hey, hey, sweetie. -Walter, are you with us? [Joan] Hey, do you know you are, sweetie? Walter, can you hear me? Can you hear me? [Bubba] His eyes are open, he's all right. [Chris] Hey, buddy, they're sending an ambulance, okay? [Joan] Walter, can you hear me? [man] Be careful with him. [Chris] You want something to drink? -You know where you are? -Yeah. -[Chris] Like a cup of water? -Yeah. -Okay, let's get him water. -Somebody get him a water. I just kind of wish it wouldn't have been Walter though because he's been standing his ground the whole time. I'm glad you're not dead. You held out a long time, man. [Randy] That is a positive now that there's less now, so it's almost over. You need a beverage or some M&M's? [Ronny] You gotta get up, man. Come on, now. [Chris] Yup, nothing to be ashamed of. [Pock] Rules is rules, Walter. Y'all remember to take your breaks. Where-- where's Derek? -Where's Derek at? -Derek? Did he just leave? 6.2 liter. 426 horsepower. V-8. I reckon you like some serious oomph on the hood, right? Flex them muscles a bit? Why don't we, uh, step into my office? Check out the blue book on that trade in you got. [Joan exhaling] [train whistle blaring] [jazz music] -Hey, stranger. -Hey there. How's Walter doing? Y'all get any word? Yeah, he's a little bit better. They're keeping him in the hospital overnight just to monitor him. -Okay. -Yeah. -What happened to your hand? -Oh, casualty of war. -No. -What? Pock and Randy got in a fight, -me and Ruth had to break it up. -What? -This morning. -What happened? Yeah, well, actually, uh, they were joking around. You know, kind of delirious, you know, um, just poking at each other and all that stuff. But then Pock, like, started smacking him on the ass and like, gave him a titty twister. Yeah, I know, like infantile shit like that, kind of funny at the time, but Randy wasn't having it and Pock wasn't gonna stop. And then suddenly, they're just shoving on each other and going at it. Randy has got him in a damn headlock-- -No shit. -No shit. Okay. Look. Lenny took this. Was it during the break or was it-- No, this was during the real thing and basically they-- they knocked themselves out the running. [Lenny] Best friends here. - You suck. -[Joan] Is this the slip-up? -[Chris] It's escalating. What are you gonna do, son of a-- -That's it. -[Joan] Well, there it is. [Joan gasping] [Chris] So here I'm coming in right there, ref comes over, but we get him up. Or we think he's done, but no, that ain't it. What's so funny, motherfucker? What's your problem? Better get the fuck out my face-- Hey, hey, hey, hey! Whoa, whoa! What is wrong with you? What is wrong with you? -[Chris] Dropped the N-bomb. -[Joan] No-- Somebody tried to pull me off the truck, man. [Chris] Yeah. Yeah. -Several times. -[Joan] Oh, my God. -Get the fuck out of here! -What he said. -Is he okay? -Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I guess. But you know. Shit. -Poor guy. -It's all right. It's okay. I'm gonna go and I'll go check on him-- -Cool. -Yeah, it'll be okay. Hey, don't post that or anything. -Please. -[Chris] No, course not. [announcer] Well, we want somebody to win here at Boudreaux's and that somebody is you. So maybe it's time to get rid of that old rust bucket you're driving now and climb into something new or ever so slightly pre-owned with zero down and zero interest for the first three months. Y'all will be turning heads every time you turn that corner starting today. We got guaranteed easy financing and an easy approval process. And remember, for every new vehicle that drives off this lot today, we'll throw in your first five oil changes free. Y'all like free, don't you? Huh? [door opens, closes] [thudding] [sighs] You don't get it, do you? You know, even if you do win this truck, and you're not going to, you're still gonna be the idiot who had to stand around a truck for days because he couldn't afford to buy one for himself. You know why people come here and watch us? It's a show. It's a really good show. Then you're also an idiot. Yeah, but I don't care. That's the difference. I do this professionally and I'm also really fucking good at it. But you, no matter what you do, you, uh, you always stay the idiot. That is just the way it is. Hands on! See you out there. [chatter] [hands clapping and feet stomping] [chatter continues] [honking] Hey! -Hey, baby. -Hey. -How you doing? You okay? -Yeah, I'm good. They blocked everything here 'cause more press is coming. You can park over there. Oh, I don't think we can stay. The little guy's been acting up. He's just so tired. Mm. Hey there, little buddy. [Maria] He didn't sleep much last night. -Coming tomorrow? -Yeah, we'll try. But if I can pick up a shift, then... 'Cause we need the money right now. Yeah, I know. Well, I'mma come later on. -[siren wailing] -I have to go. Kyle. Baby, it's only a car. Bye. I love you. [announcer] And when y'all just come talk to me, Bubba, or Chris, y'all probably seen Chris walking, and he's a squat little fella, but he's honest as the day is long and y'all don't tell him I said that because he is sensitive, ain't he? Yeah, y'all know, he knows. Yeah. Anyway, I'm just kidding. We love Chris around here, I'd trust him with my wife if I had one. But again, I just want to thank y'all for coming down to Boudreaux's Auto and Truck where you don't trade in, you trade up. Enjoy the show and don't forget to do old Bubba a flavor. If you set a paper cup down, pick it up. [Ruthie] "Verse 4: His wisdom is profound, His power is vast. Who has resisted Him and come out unscathed? Verse 5: He moves mountains without their knowing it and overturns them in His anger. He shakes the earth from its place and makes its pillars tremble. Verse 7: He speaks to the sun and it does not shine. He seals off the light of the stars. Verse 8: He alone stretches out the heavens and treads on the waves of the sea. Verse 9: He is the maker-- Verse 23: When a scourge brings sudden death, He mocks the despair of the innocent. Verse 24: When the land falls into the hands of the wicked, he blindfolds its judges, if it is not He, then who is it? Verse 25: My days are swifter than a runner; they fly away without a glimpse of joy. Verse 26: They skim past like boats of papyrus, like eagles swooping down on their prey. Verse 27: If I say, 'I will forget my complaint, I will change my expression, and smile.' Verse 28: I still dread all my sufferings, for I know you will not hold me innocent. Verse 30: Even if I washed myself with soap and my hands with cleansing powder. Verse 31: You would plunge me into a slime pit so that even my clothes would detest me. Verse 32: He is not a mere mortal like me that I might answer Him, that we might confront each other in court. Verse 33: If only there were someone to mediate between us, someone to bring us together. Verse 34: Someone to remove God's rod from me, so that His terror would frighten me no more. Verse 35: Then I would speak up without fear of Him, but as it now stands with me, I cannot. Chapter 10. I loathe my very life; therefore I will give free rein to my complaint and speak out in the bitterness of my soul. Verse 2: I say to God: Do not declare me guilty, but tell me what charges you have against me. [insects buzzing] Verse 3: Does it please you to oppress me, to spurn the work of your hands, while you smile on the plans of the wicked? Verse 4: Do you have eyes of flesh?

Brian, you're gonna have to wake up. -[siren wailing] -All right? Sorry, y'all, you gotta wake up. Come on. You can do it. [Joan speaking faintly over wailing siren] [Ruthie whispering verses indiscernibly] [Ruthie, whispering] "He marches nations and disperses them. Verse 24: He deprives the leaders of the earth of their reason; He makes them wander in a trackless waste. Verse 25..." [Kevin] Kyle. Kyle. [Ruthie, whispering] "Verse 3: But I desire to speak to the Almighty and to argue my case with God. Verse 4..." [Kevin] You looking for your wife? Probably has to work, huh? Somebody's gotta bring home the bacon while you just stand here all day. [Ruthie continues whispering] [Kevin] Kyle. You know, I was curious. Did she get used to the smell of cheeseburgers and French fries when you come home at night? [Ruthie] Cut it out, Kevin. [Kevin] I had a talk with her last night. Real sweetheart. -Doll. -[Ruthie] Stop it. [Kevin laughing] Maria, Maria. Really beautiful name. Maria. That Spanish? Shut the fuck up! [chuckles] [Kevin] Hey, Ruthie. Why don't you read us the verse about infidelity? Can you please try to be nice? Aw. [chuckles] [siren wailing] [grunting] What do you say now? What do you say now?

K.O., just around the corner, he ain't moving. Kyle, just-- just-- just stop. He ain't moving. He was bleeding so much. He's-- [whimpers] [Chris] Yo, Kyle. What are you seeing there, buddy? Kyle? Are you still with us here? What are you seeing now? Come on, let us know. Talk to us. [Ruthie] "Put my feet in the stocks and stand watch over all my paths. Set a limit for the soles of my feet.

What did you say? -[Mama] Melissa brought it. Mom, Zach always brings you Chinese, almost every single day. [Mama] Nope, it was Melissa. -That's not possible. -[Mama] Why not? 'Cause Melissa doesn't live here anymore. -[Mama] What? -She doesn't live here anymore. [Mama] Well, where does she live? You know exactly where she lives, Mom, in Florida. -[Mama] What? -In Tallahassee? -[Mama] What, what-a-hassee? -Tallahassee, Mom! Tallahassee, Florida? Yes, and now I'm completely alone. My goodness, that is far away. Yeah. Yeah, it's far. It's far. Florida? Her age, what does she want in Florida? Down there is only retired people and wackos. -You know that, right? -What? That there are only nut jobs down there? Yeah, yeah, you're right. You're absolutely right about that. We have to get her out of there. -Mom, she's in college. -No-- Oh, really? They're crazy down there. I'll help you. All right, let's do it. Eh? How many tanks do we need to get there? [Joan laughs] I don't know. 190 to the 10, all the way. 190 to 10. 190 to 10.

Yes, you took your hands off the truck. No, I-- I had to keep my hands on the truck. -It's over. It's over, Ruth. -[babbling] I don't wanna go. Look, look, look, let's go sit down. Let's-- Look, calm down, calm down. I know, I know. I know, you had to, but I'm sorry. [Ruthie crying] [referee] Calm down. Calm yourself down. [Kathy] Everything okay, Kyle. Are you okay?

Y'all, come with me, Come inside, okay? -[Kevin] What's going on? -Uh... You can take your hands off the truck now, okay? [Kevin] Yeah, right. No, no, I'm serious. It's for your own safety. So, can you-- can you please just-- just step away from the car now-- now. Okay? Please. -[man] We're not allowed. -Yes, yes, you're allowed. I'm giving you permission. There's-- There's a little something going on over there and I'm a little worried about your safety. So, can you come with me now, please? Maybe we should listen to Joan, guys. -Now, now, now. -[Kathy] Mm. Mm. Okay, Larry. [Joan] It's okay, Brian, come on. Here we go. Come on, Brian. All right, sweetie, go follow him. Go sit down.

I mean, it was already weird in the afternoon when I-- when I left. Something wasn't right with him, but I had to leave to see my mom. [officer] What do you think? What-- What was going on? I don't know, I don't know. He didn't-- he didn't make it. He really wanted that truck. Did he really need a new car so bad? [Joan] Yeah. No... He really needed to win, I guess.
