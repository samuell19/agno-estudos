Uh, on this deployment, a combat engineer's job is to lead sweep in front of the patrol. And, uh, make sure the rest of that patrol doesn't hit any IEDs, anything like that. Just keep your eyes out for indicators, command wires, everything like that. And, uh, if we do come across an IED, to cordon it off, we make sure everybody gets a safe distance away from it, and everything like that. The mission of a Marine Corps Scout Sniper is detachment of one or more snipers, performing an assigned task of engaging selected targets, targets of opportunity, collecting and recording information, or a combination of all, contributing to the accomplishment of this Corps GS mission.

You have to throw in your fucking knees. Get on your knees. Can you get a terp, uh, to the radio, for me? This kid just came over here after about five minutes, asking me for something. He made the "boom" motion with his hands, and he said, "Bomb." -Hey, Ali, can you ask this kid if he knows where there's a bomb at? -Hey, Ali, can you ask him why he came up to me and tell me... uh, he said "the bomb," and then, he tried to tell me that there was a bomb. Uh, south of where I'm at right now. All right, Ali, thanks. This kid's lying to me. 'Cause he just sat here and made a sign for a bomb. -And he said "bomb" twice. - Oh, you're full of shit. And he pointed to the 611. All right. Thanks, Ali. Little fucking liar. One of the benefits of being, uh, in Afghanistan. The only benefit of being in Afghanistan. Does that work for him? You're all accomplices to this crime. Oh, are you afraid I'm gonna shoot you with this camera? It doesn't shoot bullets, I promise. Why are you so angry? Cheer up. Salaam alaikum.

Tell him to pick up his... He's holding it up in the air. - All right, I'll give you one break. Tell him to stop right there. God, I hope we still have more recycled part. I need plenty of stock. Go.

Where is it, Vera? Pull it down. Yeah, and when you travel... You have a problem down with me? The red wire... And she was just an innocent girl. And she's saying, "I'm gonna be dying soon. Because of him, he passed away from me." Tell her, tell her, no, she's not gonna die. Tell her we're here to help her, and that we're very sorry. - "Thank God -you are patient with me." "I have two children with him, I mean, what should I do? I mean, nobody of my family can take care of those two little kids." Tell her, I can do it for her. - We should go. - Yeah, go ahead. Hey, uh, tell him we need every man in this whole group of compounds to my right now. -And yes, women, too. We have that, too. All women. - Okay. You know why we're here, right? It's because there's a very high-value individual here. I don't care, right now, about their customs or their courtesies. I want every single man that is here, -I want them out here. -Hey, bud. No, no, no... Hey, if every man does not come out, we're gonna go in, and pull every single one of them out. What do we got? Turban, uh, his head wrapped with a black, uh, turban, and... Right here. All green, black vest, white turban. Like a white dot on top of his head. You. Come here. Yeah, roger. -Roger. -Yes. It looks like we just broke up a Taliban meeting. This is a Taliban meeting, true. It sure is. We need to fucking POI all these guys and take 'em all. You, here. And pull everybody in green, okay? Hey, what's the deal? Get everybody in green. All right, he's fucking... We still don't know what's going on... I can go over there, and do those three fuckers. Do you want the three? Over there. I'm talking about going over there and do those three. Let's take him to the back. Hey, Jamal. All right, coming your way. Hey. We got this guy coming. Hey, Thomas. -When we get back to it... -They're not talking. -What's up? -They're not talking. -All right. Everybody come here. - Hey. Be prepared... Hey, they're sending 3rd for aid support. All right, good. - Hey. - Good shit. I need a lighter. -We got in past the red light. -A man with ragged clothes... Classic, though. The guy in the green was just, like, smiling. It was weird. Sir? Because he's, he's one of the inside men. Hey, look at where he was sitting, too. He was sitting at a pretty, kinda, like central location, where everybody's paying attention to him. He's the head shit. Hey, that's a solid break. I don't... a day out, it could be less, a day less, means one dead found. Check this out. But no one's talking to him. Get them all inside. You got it, you got it secured, man? Yeah, I got it secured. Whoa, bro. - Hey, look at that. - Take care. It's a goat. -Yeah, might be a goat. -Is it a goat? It's a goat. No wires running through it? No, I don't see any. I got something on the side, man. So, I think we're good. Looks like peanuts. Get him away from the damn door. Hey. Get on fucking back there. Hey, don't look. Don't look. -Hey, guys. Turn, turn around. - Hey. Don't look. Don't look. - Over here, Miles. -They go for you, sir. - Hey, hey! You! - I got it, hey. Hey, sit your fucking ass down. Hey, can anyone come and help with this? We're gonna have to have, like, a... Wow, that was good. Hey, Stuart. Can I relay with Six, to get a loader come in and have him bring us all some water? - I already did, buddy. -All right, man. You said it. And we're not allowed to say that shit. - No, I'm not. -I know that. Yeah, but... Oh, yeah. To, uh, send a patrol to, uh, take in those guys. Tell him to come here. We have 360 degrees security. And they all look innocent anyways. - Say it again? You fucker. Yeah, ask me again, then. What do you think? -About these guys? - Yeah. I don't know. I'm, I'm jaded. I'm... I think these guys are all just hanging out. I don't think they're bad guys, but... when we kill 'em, we see the same dudes in the same clothes. So, who knows? You wanna see it? It'll be easy to get me in trouble, Arty. Your name is Frank? -Yes, sir. -What does it mean? Therefore, it's not a real a birth name. I need to do some thinking. Allahu akbar. Allahu akbar. Bring it in real close, so I can get this over with. We got everybody? Overall, patrol didn't go as planned and everybody knows I'm not gonna be the dead horse. We sat there and we got the cordon. And we had suspicious individuals, looked like a Taliban meeting. I have, to this... for the rest of my fucking deployment, say it was. We can't control that. Whatever. It wasn't how we planned, but everybody reacted good. We'd be around, you know. What was supposed to happen went to, uh, what did happen. Um, good job overall, and uh... That's all I got. So, all those guys are fucking... All those guys are free to go. Every fucking one of 'em. Are they pissed? - I would be pissed. So, mate... that's our fucking role today. Um, that's it. Do what you do. Look at that back. Look at that, fucking motivation right there. Look at that. Oh, check out this back. What's that shit? What's that shit? Yes, sir! - Get some! - Get some! - Get some! - Get some! -Get some! - Hell, yeah! - Yeah! - We're going up! Get it! Get it! Yeah! - One, two! -Three, four, five. - Get some! Get some! - That's about ten! - Get some! Check. - You gotta hit it. - Hit it. Oh, yeah. Oh, god, no. So here we are, staying in Afghanistan, Patrol Base Alcatraz. With two dudes, whose names I'm not gonna mention. Luckily, for us, Afghanistan's a hash farm. You keep calling it a hash farm. What do you think? This is risky as possible. Oh, yeah. Dude, I'm way too fucked up to be on camera. Someone spit some fucking rhymes. No, ask me... Interview me while we're fucked up. I'm gonna put it in a movie. -Do you think, uh... Did you ever think you were gonna be deployed? To something like this right now? -Yeah. -Yeah. All right, well, to be quite frank with you, Mr. Lawyer, I, uh... No. Fuck no, man. You know, you join the Marine Corps, you think the Marine Corp is like a bunch of perfect people, -you know. - Yeah. That don't do anything bad, don't curse. And they're jusreally squared away killers, you know. And then, the Marine Corps is filled up with the most fucked up individuals I've ever met. -Yeah. - You know? Just like me, you know? Sir. These guys are like... Hey. Salaam. Salaam alaikum. - Salaam! -Well, what's going on out here? - Come in. - Come now. - Sure great to see you. - Hello. Good morning. Hello. Good morning. What's up?

Uh, here, hey. - Take this. - Oh, no, no, no. I can't fucking be carrying this shit around. Hey, be careful with that thing. Yeah, grunt. Hey, do not blow anyone's head off. No, I'm not. This is the safety? - Yeah. - Safety? Yeah, yeah. Boom, boom, and then... - No... -Yeah. This one worked, they changed it. No, no, no. It's good. He's probably thinking, "This guy cannot smoke at all." I don't think this guy can outsmoke me at all. They're making fun of me. Hey! Red? My eyes? It's good, man. Gunner shooting the Taliban, the Sangin. Radio, to me. That is an intense firefight. - That's a jock. What's with the music? Music, come on. This is a recruiting video, isn't it? This is Afghani, ain't it? Yeah. Commander. Commando! You know, how awesome would combat be if there's a rise against point or something, and some kind of like, rock band, where you fucking just make it look like someone's dead? He's gonna be the point man. -He's gonna be our rear guard. - Okay. Whatever the enemy has planned, by the grace of God... they're not gonna succeed. Let us pray. Father, in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth... Right, get support. Back up. -Pipe! - On that truck! - Twelve o' clock! Too close! Smack, shift! This side! Where's he coming from? Out of that square! Right in front of us on the hole! Hey! You see the smoke right in front of us? - Yeah. - See that -fucking square? - Yeah! Shoothe fucking square! Down! Down! Not that square, up to the left of it. Fuck you, motherfuckers! - He missed it. - Fuck, man. -You gotta get it in there. - He missed it! They were looking in the completely wrong spot. Fucking run! Fucking run! - Yeah! - Run, bitch! Oh, god. This is the point where you just start... Shooting people. ...blowing everything up. -And they're just-- - I'm good. It's not worth it, just shoot everything, dude. Blow every damn thing up around here. They'll get the idea. Hey! Hey, we got it! Get inside! Hey, tell them to start. - Fall out! - Hey, we got boarders -in that compound! - I know. - Go, go, go! - Fuck you! - Go, go, go! - Jesus fuckin-- Whoa! Jesus fucking... - Shit. Use gunshots! What?

Hey, I'm fucking bleeding. Don't, don't... In their way, 'cause... You're not on auto. All right, this motherfucker's bleeding. We got him in the COC right now. We're all huddled in here. 'Cause our battalion doesn't feel that we need air. But, yeah. There's everyone back there. Gotta love the little room. - Everybody, say hi to MTV. One of us just go out there, and fucking tell Charles to shoot the cars down, so I thought, "Fuck it." -Fucking death, man. -You have some five mil. Well, the blood is fucking... -It stopped flowing already. - How you feeling? I'd like some action. It's fucking stupid, dude. - Yeah. - Yeah, it is. I don't know what the fuck's going on. Who the fuck is there? Who the fuck is anything? He asked, said Fazaj, fucking... I don't know why Matt isn't here yet. We got some nice fucking... We're right here by ourselves. You just realized that shit, man? - Fucking shrapnel. -Is everyone good in here? There was sniper fire. I felt it went ght fucking by me and hit the ground. - Get it done. - Uh-huh. You got shrapnel in yours, sit down. Combat camera, let me see your face. Shrapnel in your face. - Yeah. - On your face. Look. It's gonna be the fastest medevac ever. -All right. -We're still taking indirect. We're still taking small arms. We have to get him on the bird. As fast as possible. Where's the bird landing? Some place. We have to be fast. -Oh, man. -All right? -I got it. -You good? - I'm good. -You good? Go, let's go. Grab this, grab this. Grab it in front of him. Where are we gonna stop, then? Does it burn? What are you doing, idiot? -Stop right here till it lands. - Stop on the bird. Stop right here till it lands. Right here. We're right behind the bird for right now. - Set him down. - Get him this way. Get him in the steepest one, guys. 'Scuse me. How you doing, brother? Hauser, how you feeling, man? You're going home, manI fucking love you, man. -Hauser, how you doing, buddy? - Good. Breathing all right? - Go, go, go! - Go! Advance to the fucking bird. Watch the bird! Watch the bird! Run! Let's go. Come on, go! Go! Go! How you doing, buddy? Another day, man. Another day. So, what happened to you today? Yeah, I got fucking... shrapnel in my head. Just... just a boo-boo. Uh... I don't, I don't wanna... I don't want any more combat. It's like, I'm good after this. You ready to go home, aren't you? Yeah. I think everybody is, today. How you feeling? I don't know. Scared. I mean, I'm fine now, but... when it was happening, I was like... "What the fuck, dude?" I never thought that... they'd get that close, you know. I know, I never thought they'd hit us in the compound. Where were you when that happened? I was, uh... over that side. But, trucks, sniper fucking... just missed me, hit the ground. And I was like, "Holy shit." And then, fucking... And then, fucking... They fucking hit us with a... 30 mike-mike, exploded. Grenade launcher. Right? Grenade launcher? I'm, I'm a cameraman. I don't know. I don't know what that shit's called. So... I fucking... I saw the guy that got hit. Hauser. They started dragging him. And, uh, and anyways, I was bleeding. And, uh... What's going on? Anyway. Uh, so, I was bleeding. And then, I was like... I knew I wasn't hurt that bad. I knew it was just a cut. But I was still scared. I just kept filming, and uh... if you looked through the camera... When you look through the camera, and... the viewfinder, it's almost like, "It's not happening." You know. It's almost like it's a movie. You're just watching a movie. I want you to meet the men of First Battalion Sixth Marine Regiment. Reloading! Gets you out of nowhere... I'm in a sleeping bag, still. So, all of a sudden, you hear the flaresoing off, RPG, then, fires just start going off. Just to the northwest of us, across the Helmand River, they have a ridgeline up there. And there's caves in the ridgeline, that they'll crawl into. And they engage us from there. There's guns and ammo. By the time, like, after a couple hours, we were like... Probably had a hundred, still left for a .50 cal, and that was it. It's that really bad out, real quick. Slow it down! - Slow it down! - What? IDF 30mm grenades, hitting inside the compound. Getting close, real close. I mean, we took a casualty. Uh, took a couple casualties. You know, you hear about people being battle-tested. This one tested the boys. That video, most of it shot by young, Lance Corporal Jacob Lagoze. All of the wounded, we are told, have recovered or are returning to duty. Hey, ex-cal's on the way! -But listen to... Just stand back over here. Fucking 91. That first compound looked all fucked up, you see it? Yeah. You can get out here, dude. -You can get a better shot. - Shit. - Fuck, yeah. Yeah! Fuck, yes! That had to be one of the coolest fucking things, -I have ever seen. -Yeah. They have all this shit on video, goddamn it. - It's all... -It's all there, brother. -Oh, it's all there, brother. - Yeah, so... - Look here. Motherfuckers. Whoo! Shot my pack. That's probably the one that ricocheted right by me. Am I happy to see you. - Man, we found... -...this big ass fucking hole. -Whoo! That was a close one. I was standing at west OP. I was just chilling there. And then, out of nowhere, I get shot by this sniper. The bullet goes through my Marine Corp tattoo. And, uh, it comes out of my chest. Right here. And the bullet gets lodged into my jaw. I don't think there's any more that, anything more remote than that shit, man. It shot, it was my only tattoo at the time. It was my first tattoo, and it was a mote tattoo. And I always hated it before that. Just because, fucking... I feel like I'm branded with the Marine Corps. I don't know. It just sucks. But, now I have a gunshot wound through my fucking tattoo. I think the Taliban are a bunch of pussies. 'Cause all they like to do is blow us up. They don't shoot at us. At least here. It's really annoying. Describe the mind-set, when they do shoot at you. What, my mind-set? Uh... Fun. When I get shot at, it's fun. And then it doesn't happen. It's just a giant disappointment. Coming here sucked dick. But firefights are by far... the greatest adrenaline rush ever. It's better than skydiving. Now, if I could... contribute skydiving and sex, might reach firefight status. But doubtful. My son was moving like he was going back toward the compound. Well, let's go up there. So... Ah, shit, they got snipers. We'll get the snipers, man. Cease-fire! Cody and fucking, uh, Harper got hit. What? - Are you kidding me? - No. Hey, they need a corpsman! We need a corpsman! Corpsman, to your left. Holy fuck! - Fuck! -Shit. Roger. Be advised... Fuck. We're staying in radio connection. Hey, Peter, can you grab me those? - Gotta chill, bro. - Dude. Huh? No, no, no. Afghanistan is a beautiful country. There's flowers and running water. And just, beautiful people. This whole country pretty much smells like shit. And I hate it. That's all there is. Fucking giant holes in the ground, everywhere. And fucking people shooting at you. There is nothing to love about this country. We got our man. Nothing to worry about. There we go. Right index. I'm a funny guy. People like me. -Ah, you got me. You get cleaned up before you bed down. - Yeah. It'll probably be cleaned up. Yeah. -Roger. Up outside. -Yeah. Goddamn, you can still see the point of fucking art. ...be advised, there are two... ...just chilling, right outside. You want one? Oh, you got one already. What are you fucking doing there? You're not recording that, are you? You, you are? He's like, "I'm gonna share this to the Taliban." You don't, you suck, not... You don't blow. What we're gonna do, is we're gonna play Afghans... versus the Marines. Okay. All the kids get on this side. Hey, Dan, that side. Just talk to me. Talk to who? You, or him? - Uh, you. -Okay. Um, just tell me when you're ready. All right. Uh, so, I think we, we kinda went over that yesterday, what we wanted to, uh, to cover. Right. Um, did you just wanna start by telling us, uh, what led to this? What you guys had to start doing this? -And what's good, you know? -Okay, sounds good. Uh, well, what you're looking at right now is what we like to call "Felber Field." Uh, our... One of our Marines in First Platoon, Lance Corporal Brian Felber, was critically wounded in an IED strike when we first got to Kajaki Sofla. And, uh, ever since then, we've been tracking his recovery. Bethesda, now, he's come a long way from, from pretty, uh, devastating wounds. And we just found out, uh, that he's been transferred to outpatient care. Uh, in order to celebrate that, we had an annual soccer game yesterday, with all the local national children. And, uh, the purpose is kinda twofold. Um... When we came to Kajaki Sofla and secured the area from the Taliban for the first time in several years, the people started to get pretty high expectations. Well, we, we hope... We hope to, uh, talk with you... End the war. Hey. -End the war. - Hey. -Good. End the war. Color. Coloring book. -Come here. -Coloring book. Come on. Draw a dog. -Yeah. Draw a dog. Stop the fucking donkey! Stop the fucking donkey, bitch. Get the fuck off. Get off! Get off the donkey. Get off! Get off the fucking donkey. What the fuck you got in here, huh? Huh? What the fuck is this shit? What's in here? What's in here? Get the fuck outta here, donkey. What the fuck is this shit? Huh? Huh? What's going on here, huh? Where's the fucking Taliban? Where's the fucking Taliban? Where's the Tal-- Motherfucker, where you going? Where's the fucking Taliban, huh? -Where's the fucking Taliban? Where's the Taliban? Good. I'm just kidding. Here. Come here. Chocolate. He's about to cry. Chocolate. Yeah, permanent. - It's okay. It's okay. No, no. They say that the hospital... Gotta pick up the body bag. - That's right. Oh. He needs to grab this thing... Warrick. - What do you need? - A pack. It suits the first part. Grab the other side. Come on, make sure we run in feet first, though. Yeah. No one shot him. They were playing with a grenade or something. And it went off. They said they were playing with-- They said they were playing with a cartridge. -And then it blew up. So... Let us pray. Almighty God, we stand before You, this morning, Lord, to mourn a comrade, a son, a friend, and an American patriot. I thank you, Lord, for the willingness that Lance Corporal Frankie Watson had to do. Lord, he did something that more than 90 percent of the population would not do, and that is to volunteer to serve his country in a time of war. I thank You for his service. And he was one of the ones that You called and that You empowered for the sacred task of defending the liberty that You have granted us. The vast majority of people in our nation will live their lives wondering if they have ever made a difference in the world. I thank You, Lord, that Lance Corporal Watson never had to wonder about that. He made a difference in the lives of his family, his comrades, and for hundreds of millions of Americans, who will never even know his name, but benefit from his unselfish sacrifice. I pray, Father God, that You would grant rest and peace to Lance Corporal Watson's soul, as he makes his final trip home. I pray that You would love and comfort his grieving family, and remind them that though pain endures through the night, Your word states, that Lord, that "joy comes in the morning." I pray, Lord, that You would give them more grace than they can ever understand, and more peace than they can ever imagine. I pray for his fellow Marines and sailors who, at this moment, mourn his passing. Who, yet, but still drive on to accomplish a mission that You have called all of us to. In Your holy and saving name, I pray. Amen. Hey, I'm gonna fuck you up. Look what I did to your cousin. All right, man. What time... Over herecadet. All right, work that over here.
