Ugh. Now I gotta look for a Brookstone. All right, what time's our connecting flight? [scoffs] I don't know. - You don't know? - Mm-mmm. Okay, Marcus, if you're sick, just tell me. Look, I'm not sick. I'm on vacation. I told you. - While I'm on vacation, I'ma just float. - You just gonna float? - Yep. - Okay. You trying to tell me you don't currently have all of our connecting flights saved in your phone? Not at all. Floating. Okay. They change our gates on us. You still floating? Look here, baby. They could put us on a whole nother shuttle - to a whole nother terminal… - Hmm. …and I'll be fine with that. - Ooh. - I'm floating, baby. That might be the single sexiest thing you've ever said to me. - Come here, Mr. Parker. Yeah. - Look at you, I like that. Mmm. [announcer on PA system] Attention, Marcus and Emily Parker. - Please come to the TSA immediately. - What? You have failed to notify your airline - that you are registered sex offenders. - [Emily] What? - I repeat. - What? Depraved, nasty-ass sex offenders. [person laughing] [two persons laughing] - [both laughing] - I knew it had to be them. - [Kyla whoops] - [Ron] Ha! - Will you put that thing down? - What the fuck is wrong with y'all? - [Kyla] So happy to see you! - [Ron groans] [Kyla giggles] Look at us. All together again. You guys, we have been so stoked for this. - I know. - We really have. I mean, Ron and I have been to all the best places in the world. [Emily] Yeah. - Reno, Orlando, Panama City. - That's in Panama. - Mexico City. - It's in Mexico. But never the fucking Caribbean! It's all because of you, Marcus. Thank you. Look, we just wanted to give you guys a real honeymoon. You deserve that. Plus, I got a really good deal, so it was a no-brainer. But just so you know, no cliff jumping this time. [chuckles] You say that when you're sober. No, I'm serious, for a specific reason, you know, um… - I'm so excited. Girl, you tell them. - You want me to tell them? You tell them. - No, you tell them. - [Emily] Um… Well, Marcus and I, um… We're going to start trying to have a baby. We trying to have a baby. [laughs] Fuck me in the ass. That's amazing. Yes. You two are gonna love being parents. It is the best thing that has ever happened to us. I mean, you wouldn't even believe how different our lives have become. I mean, we've grown up. We've really settled down. You know? We're so boring, I don't even recognize us anymore. [Ron] I mean, look at me. Never thought I was going to be one of those overprotective helicopter dads, - but that baby is all I think about. - [Kyla grunts] - He's obsessed. - [Ron stammers] I don't mean to alarm you, but I just found this crawling under our table. I believe it's yours? - He's crawling? - He's crawling? - That's fucking amazing! - Holy shit! It's your first time! - Good job! - He's a prodigy! He's amazing. [Kyla] Honey, you're the most amazing baby in the whole world. We love you, Marcus. So where is the guest of honor? - Two o'clock. Coming in hot! - [Kyla] Whoo! - [Ron] Yo-ho-ho! - [Marcus laughs] That's right! Whoo! - Yeah! - I can't believe you made it. I can't believe it either. And a million thanks for the invitation. As a hotel manager, it seems I am forever the host but never the guest. We are so happy you are here. We had to have you. Please. An all-expense-paid vacation in exchange for some light babysitting with my favorite little man in the world? Of course I'd drop everything. Plus, it's the Caribbean, the land of love and romance. Who knows what awaits an exceedingly single man like myself? But now, if you'll excuse me, I must powder my nose. - Bye! - [Ron] Classic Maurillio. Such a sweetheart. Watch this. Stop that man! He has anthrax! The TSA is a stupid fucking job. And all of you guys have no fucking sense of humor. You need to have a good laugh. I was having a fun time!

Feel free to move about the cabin. Enjoy your flight. - Baby, what is that? - It's an ovulation tracker. Is it weird that you have my ovulation cycle on your phone? I'm just trying to stay on it. So we don't have to guess. - We know exactly when it's ready. - [sighs] [cell phone chimes] - [automated voice] You are ovulating. - Baby, shut that... Gotta figure how to turn these notifications off. Oh, my God. You're ovulating? That's awesome, Em. No, no, no, no. It's just... It's the test run. If you need to, you can do some inseminating in the bathroom. - You up for it? - [Kyla grunts] - No, I think we're done. - No, we're good. Yeah. Are you sure? Kyla and I just did it in the back one. It was great. And I would definitely not use the front of the plane facilities. Disposing of a fulfilled diaper during turbulence was quite challenging. Hey, I... I noticed something a bit odd before I left. As I was making my seat selection, I asked to be placed closer to you all, and the agent said that you and Emily are not on the returning flight. Are you aware of that? What? Pfft. Yeah, I'm aware, 'cause we staying for a couple extra more days. Just a little longer. [chuckles] And do lots and lots of inseminating? [laughs] Ah. I see. Excuse me. You didn't tell them. Did I actually tell them why we're going? No! Marcus! Why? Look, man, they gonna be long gone by the time I get into my work thing. - You mean your meeting? - It's not just any meeting, baby. It's an interview to build a fucking five-star hotel. Okay? - Look, the CEO is flying in for this. - [Kyla] Sir, sir, sir! [Marcus] I can't let those animals anywhere near her. What happened to the guy that was just floating? Baby, that's... that's what I'm doing. I'm fucking floating. And that's what I'ma do for five days. I'ma float with their out-of-control ass, okay? And then they gonna leave, and I get right in business mode again. Keep everything separate, and I'm relaxed. Why can't you just take a Valium like the rest of us? [Ron] What the shit? [laughs] - [Kyla] This is nice! - [Emily] Oh, my God! - God… [laughs] - [groans] - [Kyla] Holy shit! This is incredible. - [Ron] Oh, my God! Amazing! What are they doing letting us in a place this nice? [Kyla] I know. They really fucked up. - [gasps] Mimosas! [giggles] - Oh! - [Kyla] Hi. Thank you. - Welcome. Look how nice this place is. Could you imagine Parker Construction… building a beautiful hotel like this in Chicago? This hotel has two different sushi bars. Did you see the full meditation temple on the way in? [shrieking] What? Helicopter pad. This hotel has a fucking helicopter pad? Guys, we should get a helicopter so we can land it on the helicopter pad. Yes! Baby, how the fuck have we not heard about this place? Strange name though. The Kim Wae. Oh, Kim Wae, it's a Korean ownership group. How'd you know that? Uh… I read about it before I got here, because I... Before I get to places, I like to, like, read up on it. You do the same thing, don't you? - No. - [Kyla] Marcus! How the hell did you get us in here? I was talking shop with the manager. He said this is booked out five years in advance. He... He said five years, huh? I guess... [chuckling] I guess I was lucky. You know? It's so weird how lucky you get sometimes. Mm-hmm. Very weird, ain't it, baby? You know, so I'm about to go take a shower, because I feel a little funky sitting on that plane. Whoa, hey, Marcus. I just opened this. Bruh, look, you gotta pace yourself, brother. We got five days here. This is 12-year-old El Mirador Grand Reserve. This bottle of rum is like 700 bucks. And there's a note attached. "Thank you for being so accommodating. Compliments of the group." [gasps] I love compliments, and I love rum. And I love compliments. Given the information in front of you, is there any scenario where we don't drink this rum right fucking now? He does have a point, baby. - [huffs] - Yeah. All... All right. Yeah, okay, one shot. If we do one shot, it can't kill us, right? Shots, shots, shots, shots! [Kyla] Whoo! - Cheers! Fuck it. - Whoo! - [Emily] Yeah! Ah! - [Ron] Mmm. [crowd cheering] [Emily] Yeah, I made it! - [crowd cheering] - Yeah! - [Kyla] Whoo! - [Ron grunts] To everyone here! To everyone! - [crowd cheering] - [Emily] Yeah! - [Ron] Yeah! - [Kyla] Whoo! [no audible dialogue] [Ron exhaling] - I fucking love you! - I fucking love you! [shouts] [retches] [shouts] What? [Maurillio] Here you are. - Sort of. - Hmm? - I was wondering where you ended up. - [baby coos] - Did we... Did we sleep out here? - [Kyla] Oh! - [groans] We should get some brunch going. - [groans] - Ooh, a menu! - Oh, my baby! Oh, come here, sweetheart. - [Emily] Oh, God… - Thank you for watching him last night. Hi! Aw. Man, we went hard last night. You should've seen Mommy talk her way out of getting arrested last night. You would've been so proud. You guys, you thinking conch fritters or something from the smoothie family? - Baby, something definitely fried. - No, I want something healthy. I'll take a smoothie, please. - [Ron] Okay. - I'm with her. - [Emily groans] - Let's go healthy. - Why don't you make it two... - [Ron] Okay. - What? Oh… Just someone… - [Kyla sighs] [Ron] Ah, oh… See anybody in there? No? [Kyla] Yeah. I don't see anybody. - [Ron] Hmm. Just gotta find a waiter. - [cell phone vibrating] [Ron] Oh, there... I'm just gonna send my vibes, I'm just gonna... Nope… Zeke, what's up? First of all, there's nothing to worry about. Yeah, man, everything's totally fine. Every time y'all say shit like this, something fucked up has happened. Have you not checked your phone? We've been trying to reach you for the last 24 hours. Yo, did you turn your notifications off or something? Look, I don't know. Maybe I did. What's up? The meeting with the CEO, Mrs. Kim? It got moved up. She's flying in this Tuesday. Wha... Whoa, whoa, whoa. - [Kyla] Oh, God. - Why would they do that? All right, motherfuckers! What do we want? We want breakfast coladas? [Zeke] No idea, man. But I guess all of the executives landed there this morning. Lucky you're already out there, right? - Right there. - No, no, no. No, no, no. Shit! - You okay? - [Zeke] Brother, chill. We called to tell you we got you covered. We even overnighted you the handouts. That's right. No need to thank us or anything. I don't wanna thank y'all. Fuck y'all. Look... Whoa. Damn. Fuck. Fuck! Oh, you must be Mr. Parker. Fuck yes, he is. Ah! Ron, no. Yeah. But he's right. I am... I... I am Mr. Parker. My name is Goe. I'm from the advance team for the Kim Wae Group. Wait. Are you the Kim Wae people... - Like is this your hotel? - Mm-hmm. Okay, because I, for one, really need to tell you how much fucking ass this place kicks! No, no, no. Hey, hey, stop! I mean, I love hotels. I'm relaxed, I'm horny. I'm relaxed, I'm horny… - [scoffs] Sit down. - …after a day in the sun, or three. - It's amazing. - Y-You're not hiring, are you? [Marcus] Look, don't pay them no mind. I'm sorry. Yes. How... How can I help you? We merely wanted to extend our apologies for the change in schedule. Again, thank you for being so accommodating. Accommodating? Wait. The rum. The rum was from you. Yes. I hope you enjoyed it. Oh, enjoyed it? I mean... Wait. Was I on fire last night? Just your head, babe. You... Don't listen. - They just be playing. [laughs] - [Goe] Oh. And you know something? We was getting kind of busy, 'cause we about to get breakfast. So if we can catch up later today, that would be… - [blows] That'd be perfect. - [Goe] Oh, we hope to catch up tonight. Mr. Yeon, who is the lead on the Chicago project, is very eager to meet with you before Mrs. Kim arrives. Mr. Yeon is our most senior vice president. He's invited you for drinks down at the lagoon tonight as our guests. All of you. - You don't have to invite all of us. - [Goe] No, no, no, no. It's our pleasure. We insist. [sighs] Appreciate it. That's right. We'll... We'll be at the lagoon tonight. [Ron] What was that all about? I'm just confused. Marcus, why don't you just tell them? Tell us? Tell us what? Fuck! [Marcus] Okay, again. This is a big deal for me and my company. So, everybody just please, please be presentable. Ah, speaking of. Hold on. [chuckles] I knew I should've packed more clothes. Back to the baby carrier. - Oh? Oh! - [Kyla] Oh! - Thanks, Maurillio! - Maurillio, you're the best. - Baby, just get a drink. - No, I don't wanna have a drink, baby. - I am hungover, and I'm nervous. - [sighs] This isn't how I pictured things going at all. - Okay, can you remember something for me? - Thank you. That you are personable, you are charismatic, and you are damn good at your job. Baby, I know, I know. I know I'm good, but I have to be the best, okay? Picture your dick. - Oh, yeah. - [Kyla] Mmm. Wait, what? It's exactly what we did when we prepared for battle. Visualize to achieve. Marcus, you got more talent in the tip of your dick hole than everybody at this entire party. I'm actually visualizing it right now. And, wow, it's a gorgeous dick. Stop it! Cut the shit. Stop it! I talked to y'all earlier, and I thought y'all heard me loud and clear. I don't want you talking to nobody, I don't want you making eye contact, and I especially don't want you talking about my damn dick, okay? Ah, excuse me? Hi. You must be Marcus Parker? I'm Yeon, VP of properties at Kim Wae. Oh. [chuckles] [stammers] You're Yeon. First of all, what I was just... What you was just hearing, that was me, uh, being funny. You know, I was... I was just playing around with my friends. You know, it's a little American humor. Oh, right. [chuckles] I went to college in Pittsburgh. I must've missed the class on American humor. Damn. Uh, well, I own a construction company. - I'm not a stand-up comic, so maybe I... - Clearly. But check this out. I am excited to meet Mrs. Kim. When I tell you this presentation is perfect, - I've been working on it for months... - Mr. Parker, I'm-I'm sorry. Let me stop you right there. - Can I be honest with you? - Of course you can. You are not my first choice for this job. - What? - It's nothing personal. We just already have another candidate we've worked with before. He's a real no-brainer, honestly. So, I don't know why Mrs. Kim is making us go through this. Frankly, I find this whole thing a little insulting. Is it… [chuckles] Is it insulting for you, or is it insulting for me? Ah, for both of us. - Goddamn, that was honest. Okay. - Anyway, nice to meet you. [stammers] Zero overages! Sorry, what? We took on 12 major projects last year and had zero overages. - Really? - Y-Yes. Uh, and I'm Emily, Marcus's wife. And I can attest to that. And you are? Um… Um… I'm Kyla. And I am Ron. And you work with him, or… [Kyla] Mm-mmm. - [Ron clears throat] - [Kyla] Mm-hmm. [in Korean] [in English] Oh, you can speak Korean? [Ron, in Korean] [in English] And I second that, but make it a double. That was… esoteric. - But oddly impressive. As are you both. - [giggling, speaks softly] Ooh, thanks. When the wind is right, we will be releasing these lanterns. The flame represents happiness and good luck. Whew. Wow. [stammers] Ron, first of all, thank you, man. How do you always pull that off? Okay, I'm going to let you in on a secret, Marcus. I don't know if you've noticed. Everybody likes me. Come on now. Everybody? No, I'm serious. - [sighs] - Every single person I have ever met. [giggles] The crazy thing is he likes them all back. - Right? - Oh, yeah. Okay, well, you can't possibly like everybody back... No, Emily. I do. Every single person. - Every single person in the entire... - What? Fucking hell! What's wrong with you people? Come on. What are you doing? I'm... I'm an invited guest. Okay, I'm not invited invited. I'm just looking for somebody. - Okay, handsome, what's it gonna be? - [Maurillio] What's up with that guy? Fifty, a hunny? Now you tell me. - You've got to be kidding me. - [guest] What's wrong with you people? - No. No! - [waiter] I gotta do my job. No, no, no, no, no! What the fuck are you doing here? Fuck you, lady! Fuck me? Fuck you! Get the fuck out of here! [chuckles] What? Are you going to make me? What are you gonna do? I'll fucking kick your ass. - Ooh! - Ooh! - Ooh… - Ooh… Dad! Oh, my God! [chuckles] Oh, my God! - What the fuck are you doing here? - Wait. What? What do you mean what am I doing here? - That's her dad? I thought he was in jail. - So did I. I'm glad you're here. These guys wouldn't let me in. - Fuck you! And fuck you! - What's going on with this place. - Dad! - [laughs] Shit, that's Reese. I'm finally gonna meet Reese. Emily, how do I look? - [Kyla laughs] - What? Guys, look who it is! It's my dad! One... One second, one second. Don't say another word. Marcus, right? Am I right? Oh! Fuck right off. You must be Emily! [laughs] [Reese] Maurillio. Oho! That mustache! - It's even better than Kyla said. - Oh, thank you. Whoa! He's got your eyes. The most beautiful eyes in the world. - Well, Dad, you haven't seen these eyes. - [coos, chuckles] I want to introduce you to Ron. This is Ron? Kylie, you didn't say he was a fucking gorilla. - [chuckles] Well, he's my fucking gorilla. - Oh! Dad, he's my soul mate. He's the love of my life. Hold on. I thought I was the love of your life. Well, now I have two. Oh, Mr. Hackford. Can... Can I call you Reese? Whew. I cannot tell you what an honor it is to finally meet you. Salaam. Uh, a kiss on the forehead. That's the ultimate sign of respect. - Learned that from a sheikh in Kuwait. - [Emily] Mmm. Okay, Ron. It's nice to finally… Blah, blah, blah. Don't worry. I approve. Or do I? - [laughing] - [laughing] Did you see his face? [laughing] That was good. Goddamn it, - I can't believe I'm actually here. - Yeah. - Yeah, you know, neither can we. - Yeah, man. It's crazy that you... That you're here. I mean, if you don't mind me asking, why you... why are you here? Guys, this is so fucking crazy. He was literally just released from San Quentin. Just yesterday. Perfect timing, right? So, wait, Kyla, you told him to come here? No. I mean, all I told him was, like, the hotel we were staying at and then, classic my Dad, completely surprised us. Look, I have missed all the big events in Kyla's life. You know, the birth of her kid, wedding, graduation from CoolSculpting school... That one hurt. And her mom's death. May Jesus rest her beautiful, precious, lovely soul. God, I hated that witch. So after all that, I had no choice. - I had to come crash her honeymoon. - Right? - [chuckles] We are so glad you did. - [Marcus] Can I tell you something though? This particular honeymoon is not the type of honeymoon that you "crash." If you're worried about your, like, "business stuff," please do not be. Because honestly, we're cool. My dad's even cooler. Yeah, no, I'll be cool. Now where can an asshole like me get a drink around here? - We need to get him a drink! - I gotta work the room. - I'm going to the bar. - No, no. Hey, brother. It's... You don't wanna go that way. We got liquor for you. - We got some rum. In the room. - In the room. - No, we don't. - No. We... We drank it. - We get another bottle of rum… - Yeah. …just for you to celebrate. - We're gonna celebrate him. - Marcus, it's $700. It's $700. It's on me. It's on me. We gonna get another bottle for you on me. - Classy guy here. - I know! - [laughs] All right. - Okay, let's go. [Kyla] He's very nice. Thanks, Marcus. That's sweet. [shouting] Who also needs drinks? [laughing] Dad, you're so funny. I mean, come on though. - You're such a cutie-pie. - [baby Marcus cooing] [Kyla] You guys are so cute. [Reese] Okay. Oh, the rum is here. I know where this is headed. [Reese chuckles] [Ron] Don't tell me, Reese. - You're a guy that likes it straight up. - Nah, I'll just have a beer. A beer? So, Reese. Um, you know, I hate to be intrusive… Oh, ask away. Open book here. So what were you in for? [scoffs] Nothing. Absolutely nothing. I'm an innocent victim of the system. Okay, come on now. You had to do something to go in. Here's a cold one, Reese. All right, let me put it to you this way, Marcus. Kyla tells me you own your own construction company, right? - Mm-hmm. - Okay, imports, exports. And so I get a little aggressive with some tax write-offs, and all of a sudden I'm money laundering with criminal intent? Bullshit. And now I have to make up for eight fucking years of lost time. Aw… Speaking of, I got you the best wedding presents ever. - My God. Give it to me. - No, honey... Okay. - I know how great you are with money. - She's the best with money. Yeah, Ron. I just said that. But you have a family now, right? With a kid to take care of. And you gotta start thinking about your long-term financial security. - Right. - Don't ask me how, but I got you in on an amazing, rock-solid investment opportunity. - Ready? - Yes. Crypto. I'm sorry. What? - Oh, cryptocurrency. - No, I know what that is, but... Dad, I've heard of that. - Yeah, so have I. - No, no, you haven't. No, no. - This is SCOM-coin. - Did you say Scam-coin? No, SCOM-coin. - Scum-coin? - No, no, no. S-C-O-M. Yeah, it's an acronym. - For what? - For what? Fuck, I don't remember. [chuckles] But anyway, it's gonna be huge. Okay? All you gotta do is give me like 40, 50 grand and boom! You are going to be so fucking rich in no time. Dad, I'm crying. This is so sweet. It's the best wedding present ever. Okay, so I actually work in finance. Yeah. And I... I know you guys may think I'm a little conservative, but the last time I checked, cryptocurrency is insanely volatile. Yeah. They're awesome. [chuckles] Hey, trust me. You're gonna want a piece of this. - Emily, trust him. - [Emily] Oh. [Kyla] Also, I have a fun idea. - Emily, why don't we do it together? - Yes! Oh, and Marcus, I could tell the Koreans about it. - No, no. No. - [Reese] It might help you out. Can we talk about... We can talk... We need to talk. - We should. - Now we gonna talk. But you don't talk to nobody else about this shit. Yeah, no. Okay, okay. - I'ma tell you this. - T-Tell me... I want you to hear me. I do not trust Kyla's daddy for nothing. Who goes to jail for eight years for, what, tax write-offs? He went to San Quentin. Come on. You don't go to San Quentin for no tax shit. - We should know 'cause we from Chicago. - Exactly. You know he gonna stay here. You know he plans on staying here. What was I supposed to do? I couldn't have him bro-ing it up with the Koreans. You know what? Matter of fact, this motherfucker didn't even try the rum. Hold up. Did we pay for that rum? - Yeah, baby. - Did we pay for the rum? - I paid for the rum. - What the hell? Fucking right, and I had to leave a tip. Goddamn it. Calm down. You know what? When we first met Ron and Kyla, we thought... We thought that they were batshit crazy. - Yeah, we did. - And you know what? We were wrong. No, we were... Baby, we were... We were right. Okay, but they're harmless. And so that's what I'm trying to say. Maybe Reese is of the same variety. A-And it's not like he's gonna be in your meetings with you. - And that should be the plan. - Yes. We need to keep him away from the Koreans. Okay, I like that plan. In fact, let's keep him as busy as we can. And we just pray that nobody burns down the hotel. [squeals] Guys! Oh, my God. There's a bonfire. - We're all going. Come on. - [Emily] Bonfire? What? Wait. That's not a bonfire. Question. Um… Y'all wouldn't happen to know who... Whose lantern it was that-that caused this, right? [Yeon sighs] Nope. We just built this meditation temple too. Well, this is... this is gonna have to be a total rebuild, you know. From my professional opinion, you know? [Yeon] Shit! What the fuck, man? I told you not to do the stupid lantern shit. Once the lanterns are lit, you can't control the direction. You're making us look bad in front of the Americans. You had to be like, "Yeah, it'd be good to promote Asian culture. I used to do this when I was a kid." Do you know how bad it looks for a hotel group to have a building burn down? [sighs] Ironic. The lanterns were supposed to be a symbol of good luck. Goddamn. It is heaven to eat with a metal fork again. I can't tell you what it's like to drop a deuce with nobody watching. - [Ron] Deuce. [chuckles] - I'm serious, Ron. It's not funny. Do you like shitting in front of other people? I don't. [clears throat] Cool. Um… Well, look, um, what... What plans do everybody got today? You know, is it... You guys plan to do something that's off the resort? Why? Why would you wanna leave this place? I'm never leaving. [chuckles] I mean, I've never been to the Caribbean before, but this place is nice. You know, it's... It's drug lord nice. I'm sorry. "Drug lord nice"? Emily, come on. These places are like Soho Houses for all the heavies. The Barnes Brothers, Escobar. I wouldn't be surprised if Chencho himself is with us in the hot tub tonight. - [whispers] Chencho? - Chencho Novar. From Colombia? Ah, yes, Chencho Novar. I watched an entire documentary about him once. So deadly, no one who has seen his face is still alive. So scary, nobody will utter his name in public. Although I... I guess I just did. Okay, well, I... I don't think we have seen anyone like that around here. I suppose next they're gonna tell us that those aren't high-priced hookers over there. Definite hookers. They look extremely expensive though. And super niche. If you'll excuse me, I'm gonna set up camp by the pool - and check out the merchandise. - [Kyla] You earned it, Daddy. - Think of something. - What? Oh, um, hey! Um… Why don't... Why don't you guys go, um… go surfing? - Surfing! - [Kyla] That is... Mm-hmm. Let's go surfing. Let's do some surfing! Yo, Marcus. What's the room number? I'm having another little wedding gift sent here. You don't have to do that for us. It's really for her. Okay, look. Just fill my name on it, and they'll get it to me, okay? - Ron, look, thank you for doing this, man. - Oh, yeah, man. I was kind of surprised to hear you know how to surf. Nah, I don't know how to surf. I... I'm not good. I do some paddleboarding. Marcus! - Sometimes you gotta push your limits. - Okay. [Ron] Look, I'm just glad to be out here. It gives Reese and I a chance to bond, you know? Reese, I can't tell you how much this means to me. I've heard so much about you through the years and to finally get to know you... Wait. Are you sure we're going the right way? Oh, yeah, I am. Checked the map at the front desk before we left. Old habit I picked up in the service. Right. I heard. You're a park ranger. I am. Uh… It was... It was before that. Like the… service service. Special Forces. Yeah. Ah, I could've done that. I picked the hard road, pal. Sales. Now that's war. What? Look, sales isn't... It's not war. He actually fought in the war. Like combat. Oh, my bad. So tell me, have you ever killed anyone before? I don't relish in admitting it, but yes, Reese. - Yes, I have. - [chuckles] Okay, Ron. How many? [sighs] We don't really talk about it. It's, uh… It's kind of a code we all live by. We just... Code? And you can't tell us because it's a secret code. Look, Reese, that is very disrespectful. You don't ask a soldier a question like that. Forty-two. Damn. For real? Forty-two confirmed. A couple of "iffys." [chuckles] Okay, Rambo. What are you gonna tell me next? You deserve a medal for bravery? Wow. I have eight of those, actually. [sighs] What a beautiful day. I guess. [chuckles] What's wrong with you? There was a striking young woman at breakfast getting yogurt, and all I could think to say to her was, "Mmm, strawberries." Mmm. That's not gonna get it done. It is still very early, okay? All you gotta do is be yourself. Okay? And I promise by the end of this week, you are gonna be a stone-cold killer. - [Kyla giggles] - Um, do you want me to be myself, or do you want me to be a killer? Because, Emily, these are two very different things. [Emily] Oh, this is heaven. [sighs] Poor girl. If only she knew how much Ron and I assed up that chair the other night. You don't think these waves are too big? [Ron] I can't tell. - I mean, those guys are out there. - [Marcus] Those guys are fucking crazy. - I'm not going in that shit. - What? Are you guys scared? Not at all. But even in the best conditions, you have to be careful. She's a fickle mistress. You gotta respect her. You gotta listen to what she's telling you. She? The natural world, Reese. And if you just be patient, she'll reveal all the mysteries to you. It's what I've dedicated my life to. Like that. - See that bird there? - [Reese] Yeah? I can tell from here. - That bird's about to shit. - Hey, Jerome! Jerome, there you are. Damn it! I had him. Hey, tell me if you see another bird. - Tell me, how we doing this? - Brother, this thing is a bad idea. For why you even want to involve Warren? Because I'm trying go through the proper channels here. - [whispers] Oh, man. - That way we get paid, and we keep our heads on. - No, no. - You don't understand. I have to get that money. Look, tell him I have the coordinates. - [Reese speaking indistinctly] - [Marcus] How-How does he know this guy? He said he'd never been to the Caribbean before. [panting] Mr. Parker. Ron. [in Korean] Hello. [in English] What are you two doing on the backside of the island? We... We... You know something? We about to get our surf on. We about to do some surfing. Ah. I didn't know you surfed. - That's unusual for someone from Chicago. - That's not unusual. You know something? I'm... I'm a little more than somebody just from Chicago. Huh. Matter fact, it looks intimidating, but it's not. You know? All you gotta do is push your limits. That's right. Like my friend Ron says. Right, Ron? What? Oh. Yes. That's what... Yep, yep. - I like people who push their limits. - Hell yeah. All right. Well, uh, we better keep the pace up before we tighten up. - Do that. We're gonna do some surfing. - [in Korean] Let's go! - [Goe, in English] Okay. Let's go. - Hey, fools, back to the hotel. Chop, chop. Let's go. Wait, wait. You're going back? Because you just said you were gonna jump in. So, are you surfing or are you not surfing? - Yeah, that's... - [chuckles] Are you kidding me? These two caked their trunks the second they saw the waves. Caked? Me? What? You're telling me now that you're not chickening out? As a matter of fact, Reese, I'm going for it right now. Let's do this, Marcus. [chuckles] [whispering] Fuck. [Kyla] Okay, have a good nap, sweetie. Oh. Isn't he just the most beautiful thing in the entire world? [sighs] You okay? - I don't wanna have a baby. - [chuckles] Me neither right now. No, I mean, like, ever. Like, of my own. - Wait. Are you serious? - Yeah. I just saw you with baby Marcus. You were just incredible. I know! I love kids. And Marcus and I have always talked about having them, but now that the moment is here, I realized I never actually envisioned myself carrying these babies. You've gone through the process. You know what it does to your body. - Sweetheart, it's fucking hell. - [sighs] I had a stage three tear, which means I pissed and shit at the same time. - Oh, my God. - You're gonna love it. [sighs] I just love my life the way it is now. I know it sounds selfish. I know. I can hear it. But I feel like a baby would just ruin all of that. And I am the happiest I have ever, ever been. Does Marcus know? The man with the ovulation tracker on his phone? No, he doesn't know. I don't want to be a negative Nancy, but you do have to tell him. - It would literally break his heart. - Can I just say something? I don't know why I'm not eloquent or smart enough to be able to say the kind of, like, badass feminist thing that I wish I could say now, but I'm proud of you for knowing yourself. And secondly, you know, I think he's gonna understand. Come on. I mean, do you really think he's gonna lose his shit? [screams] Ah! No! Ron, what the fuck? Okay. Could be a little tough paddling out. [grunts] Man, fuck this! Okay, why don't we go back? Huh? We can come up with something. Say it's a rip current, or something. Man, you heard Reese. - I can't chicken out now. - Who gives a fuck what he thinks? You kind of cared what your father-in-law thought, huh? I don't know if you picked up on it back there. It was kind of subtle, but it just seems like Reese and I aren't connecting. I knew it. Chickenshit. Great. So now what the fuck am I supposed to do then? Go back up there alone? And look at... This motherfucker's filming us. Fuck! There's only one thing left to do, Marcus. Surf. Hell no! - Come on. You did paddleboarding. - Twice! In a lake! Look at that set, Marcus. This may be the only chance in your life to ride something that fucking perfect. Once you're out there, your instincts will kick in, and then you'll just be one with the wave. - Are you sure about this? - Believe in yourself! You can do this! - I can do this. I can do this. - You can do this! - Yes! - We're going out there, - and we're going surfing. - Yes! Yes! [singer] ♪ Well, is it true what they say about it? ♪ ♪ They say it's new… ♪ [Marcus stammers] Whoa! [screams] [Reese] Ooh! Oh! Oof! [Yeon] Mr. Parker? Mr. Parker? Mr. Parker! [gasps, groans, pants] That was violent. - Where's Ron? Is Ron okay? - I'm right here, buddy. I'm totally fine. [Reese] But you, Marcus. Fucking hell, man! I can't believe you're actually alive. Yeah. I've never seen that much water come out of a person before. Did I... Did I throw up a lot? [Reese] Mmm. -[Goe] Definitely, no -Uh, no. Then where did the water come from? Your butthole threw up, bud. [groans] Thank you, Ron. You read my mind. Oh, hey, that's for him. Baby, I got so much. - I, um… - [coos] - I'm going to need to rinse. Excuse me. - [Kyla chuckles] So, how's it going with my dad? It's going. It's good. It seems like you guys have, like, really had a chance to bond. - Yeah. Yeah, totally bonding. Yeah. - Oh, thank God! - I'm so relieved. - Huh? What? I don't know if it was, like, my weird psychic ability kind of flaring up, but I did have a moment where I was looking at you, and I was like, "Oh, my God. I love him so much." Then I was looking at my dad, and I was, "Oh, my God. I love him so much." Then I was looking at you two together and was like, "Oh, my God. What if they don't love each other so much?" Yeah. A nightmare, right? [laughs] [laughs] I know! A total nightmare. It was a total nightmare. And it got me thinking about Sue's dad doesn't get along with her husband, and that's why she got cystic acne and started collecting those little glass cats. And everyone's just worried about her. I was like, "I don't want that to happen to me." But then I'm like, "I'm just being crazy," because… you're Ron, and everyone loves you. Ha! Not literally everyone, you know. Literally everyone. Every single person. And that's why I love you. [Emily] I'm so sorry. I will never, ever, ever, ever, ever suggest surfing again. Good. 'Cause I don't want to even hear the word surfing. You know what I mean? Look, I had to do whatever I had to do to... To get rid of Kyla's fucking shady-ass father somehow. You know? Well, you don't have to worry about him tonight. Apparently he already got plans. Some business thing. Ah, thank God. [groans] [exhales sharply] Okay, so what, uh... What you had going on today? Yeah, it was good. - You know, we just kicked it by the pool… - Mmm. …just talked about stuff. - Stuff? Like, what type of stuff? - [smacks lips] Baby, you know. Girl stuff, some personal stuff, some deep stuff. - [cell phone chimes] - [automated voice] You are ovulating. [Marcus] Shit! Goddamn it! Oh, you guys just go at it. I'll turn the music up. [cell phone ringing] [Marcus] What? Hold on. Hello? Mr. Parker, it's Yeon. Hey, man. Yeon, what's going on, brother? How you doing? Mrs. Kim wanted me to check that you are still, well, alive. - You told her about that today? - No, no, no. I sent her the video. Uh, it made quite the impression. I wish I could say she found your effort admirable, but really she was just concerned about your well-being. She said that if you wanted to cancel your presentation... Whoa, whoa, whoa. Can... No, no, no. We're not using that word here. We're not canceling anything. You know, 'cause... 'cause guess what? I'm... Pfft. I am... - [stomach gurgles] - I am great. I am so fine. You're totally fine? Matter of fact, I was telling my wife how bad I want to go surfing again. - What? - Really? Well, I wasn't gonna offer this, but the group and I, we're going to the casino tonight. You and your guests are more than welcome to join, of course. But, uh, if you can't make it… [smacks lips] …that's totally fine. No, no, no. Ain't no buts. [chuckles] We... We would love to meet y'all at the casino tonight. Okay. Well, I'll see you there then. - Bye. - [stomach gurgles] [groans] Okay, that was a lot, holding that in. Uh-uh. You can't go out. You can't even walk. - I can walk. Watch. Watch me walk. - [stomach gurgles] - See? I'm walking to the bathroom. - Oh! Oh, baby. - [slot machines pinging] - [patrons talking indistinctly] - [whispers] Wow! - Okay, I'm just gonna say it. This place is nicer than Reno. Okay. And look, guys, I want all of us to have fun tonight, but the Kim Wae people are here, and I want to make a good impression. Okay? Got you. You want us to get super fucked up. Let's score some Molly, and maybe we could pitch Yeon on a hot three-way. - No, no, no, no. Hell no. - No. I'm kidding. I'm not drinking tonight. We've got our child here. Come on. We're not monsters. [laughs] How's that fucking ass tonight, buddy? You ready to get spanked? Four hundred for us. Let me go find Yeon. I'll be back. Come on, Em. You wanna play? Come on. Actually, I don't really see the appeal of gambling. What? Come. Let mama show you. You just have to know how to play. Sir, you can't have a baby at the table. - [groans] - [stomach gurgles] [Yeon] Good. Hey! Hey, Marcus! - Marcus! - Yeon. - Hey, come over here. - [in Korean] Come here, come here. - [Yeon, in English] Yeah, yeah! Sit, sit. - [in Korean] Go, go. [in English] How you doing? What's going on? - Sit, sit, Marcus. - [Goe, in Korean] Sit down. Sit down. - [in English] What's going on? - Come play with us. - Play what? - [in Korean] A drinking game, Mr. Parker. [mutters] [in English] What we call after-work drinks. This is how we bond in our business. - It's a company tradition. [chuckles] - [Goe chuckles] - Huh. - [Goe, in Korean] Get ready. - Cheers! - Cheers! - Ah! [laughs] - [in English] I win again! You all suck! You all suck! [all laughing] [laughter ends] [Marcus continues laughing] He was... He... [Yeon clears throat] Oh. These were for me? No, I'm not drinking tonight, man. I'm taking a break. I'm on a... I'm on a drink fast. Excuse me? Okay, look, I'm not trying to offend any of y'all. Especially you, Yeon. But I... I cannot do this tonight. This is how we bond. Are you saying you don't want to bond with us? No! Come on now. I just can't drink, okay? I said it's a company tradition. Somebody has to play. Twenty again? Shit! Ron, Ron! Wait. Why you and the baby... Look, no, fuck that... I need you to drink. [chuckles] Marcus, you told me specifically... I know what I said, damn it! Come with me. Come now. Mmm. So, babe, oh, my God. It looked like Marcus took your talk really well. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Because we didn't have it. I just wanna make sure I'm assessing this correctly. - This is a... This is a drinking game? - Yes. I need you to pinch hit for me. No, Marcus. If I do something like this, I'm gonna have to unleash the beast. Are you comfortable with that? Yes or no? In this case… yes. All right, you fucking pussies. - Let's do this. - No. It's you who's the pussy. [in Korean] Hey, okay, get ready! All right. Cheers! [shouts, speaks in English] Suck it! Fuck yeah! [laughs] [in Korean] [in English] Get Minjin. I saw it in his eyes. I know how much he wants this baby, and I just... I couldn't do it to him. I couldn't break his heart. - [dealer] Nineteen. Dealer wins. - You're on fucking notice, dude. But I mean, it's also so confusing. So, I think that this is just one of those moments in life - where you have to listen to that wisdom… - [sighs] Mmm. …that is deep within your soul that says, - "You cocksucker." - I'm sorry. What? You cocksucker! I see exactly what it is that you're doing. Excuse me, ma'am? You're not showing us your cards until after we find out what ours are. - You know what? You gotta go first. - Ma'am, ma'am, don't... - [Kyla] Just go first. - Don't touch the cards. - Great. You just burned the deck. - Hey, sorry. [clears throat] I thought you said you knew how to play. I do know how to play. All the face cards were out. The shoe was absolutely fucked, and I had to do something. My tits are on fire. I gotta go pump. I'll be right back. Okay, so whenever the low cards come out, that's when you go deep. Trust me. Uh-huh. [crowd cheering] [Yeon, in Korean] - [in English] Okay, we end this right now. - Fuck that, dude. I got this! Listen to me, damn it! Alcohol poisoning is fucking dangerous. - You get what I'm saying? - Dude, I fucking got this. [crowd cheering] [in Korean] Quiet, quiet! Be quiet! Calm down! Hey. Let's get ready. One. Two. Three. - One shot! - [crowd cheering] [grunting] [person cheers, claps] [cheering stops] [in English] Um… [paramedic] Fifty-five year old male… - [paramedic 2] Sir, sir! Can you hear me? - …No response. [paramedic 3] There we go. Sir, do you know where you are? He's breathing. He's breathing. [Yeon sighs] Thank God. Oh! Hi, my sweet little baby boo! Well played, Mr. Parker. Well played. [Marcus] Thank you. [chuckles] Uh, I need to find a bathroom. I'll be back. [Ron] Me too. Okay, here's the way I look at it. I've got something you want, and I really wanna fucking give it to you. So we just need to come up with some kind of agreement. I told you. Ten grand. Actually, Warren, I was thinking more like half. Half? Half of what? - [chuckles] - [chuckles] Of whatever you've got on that plane. Yeah. That was a close call. I didn't exactly make it, but thank God there were so many sinks. [Marcus] Reese? Holy shit, that is Reese. I don't know what Jerome told you about me... - Jerome not work for me. - [Reese] Okay, look. I know where your plane went down. Yeah, the location's a little hot, but I could take you there tomorrow if you want. You can do that. Or you can just give me the coordinates now. And give up all my leverage. Why the fuck would I do that? So I don't blow your damn brains out. What you gonna do? Shoot me in the middle of the dance floor? Of course not. Take him outside and then shoot him. Come on. Let's take a walk. Reese! Reese! Tell your ding-dongs to put their guns away, all right? You see this guy coming over here right now? The one who looks like he just had diarrhea? Mmm. No, not him. The one next to him. The big guy, the scary-looking motherfucker. - He's with me. - [Ron] Reese. - [chuckling] Hey, you two. - Reese. Oh, Ron, am I glad to see you. Yeah, me too, Reese. We gotta talk. It's something important. Okay. [sniffles] Why don't you like me? [crying] I don't get it. [crying continues] - [Reese] Ron, Ron. - [Ron speaks indistinctly] - Hey, um… [chuckles] …I'm... I'm Marcus. - [sniffles] Okay, come on, baby. Paint that ace! Okay, come on! Let's paint that ace. - Paint that ace with a ten! - Blackjack again. - Y'all see that? That's me all day. - [floor boss] Excuse me, ma'am. - [Emily] Hey. - I'm gonna have to ask you to leave. Why? You are aware that in this casino counting cards is strictly forbidden? Oh! Well, I'm not counting cards. See... Let me tell you how to play. You just gotta keep track of the face cards and the low cards. Boom. That is counting cards. It is? [sniffling] Get it together, man. What's the matter? [stammers] For the first time ever, I'm having to deal with all these emotions. You know, uh, disappointment, insecurity… - Okay, now is not the time to... - …inadequacy. How about anger? Huh? You feeling some anger now? Fury? No. It's, uh... It's like a pain and a sadness. I just wish you knew I would do anything for you, Reese. - Anything? - You name it. You name it. Okay, well, why don't you tell Warren here how many people you've killed? Oh, I… Warren, hey, I am Ron. Yeah, nice to meet you guys. I can't do that because of the code. - We talked about it. I... - Ron! Okay, 42 people. Forty-two. All legitimate targets though. Hmm. Every one of them. [whispers] Hey, um… I think we should get the fuck out of here. Um… I don't think you're reading the room correctly. - [chuckles] We gonna get up out of here. - That would be best. No, wait. A few iffys. You guys... They wanna hear about the iffys? What can I say, Warren? I tried. Reese, what was that all about? [Reese] What was what about? You know what. The shit with those dudes. Who? Oh, those guys. Yeah, no, they're... They're just new friends of mine. New friends who were very impressed with you, Ron. As was I. - Really? - [chuckling] Yeah, hey. Salaam and all that. Thanks again. I'll catch you guys later. Look, Ron. I know that's your father-in-law and everything, but that guy is up to something. I'm telling you. Reese? Come on. You were right. He didn't bite. [sighs] In fact, he was being a dick about it. Look, it's time to move to plan B. Yes, Jerome. I have a plan B. Tell me you know how to scuba dive. Reese is a great dude. Look at me, no the fuck he's not. He's not even an okay dude. Did you just not see that? We connected, man. I think this might've been, like, a real breakthrough. You know what? I may even look into that crypto thing he's got. - What? You don't need to be participa... - [Emily] Let me go! But I wasn't even cheating! - Wait, where's my money? - Is that Emily? Where is my money? I'm from Chicago. Let me down! Shit. Get your hands off my fucking wife! [Yeon] Again, thank you so much for doing this. [Marcus] Ah, it's okay. It's okay. We're... We're almost to your room. [inhales sharply] You wanna know something, Marcus? [laughs] I'm starting to like you. Okay, that's cool and everything, man. And-And Yeon, look, I-I like you too. No, I'm not just drunk. I mean it. You're a fighter, like me. You think on your feet. Plus, you have great friends. Fucking love you, man. - [Ron] Oh! - [Yeon] And in my opinion… - [Ron grunts] Okay. - [breathes heavily] …you should get this job. Seriously? It's my honest opinion. [chuckles] That's great, man. Too bad my opinion doesn't matter. Wait, what? What are you talking about? You're the VP. - You're in charge of this whole project. - So what? She doesn't listen to me. Mrs. Kim doesn't care one bit about my opinion. That's fucked up. - Ron, come on now. - Sorry. No. No, he's right. That is fucked up. [scoffs] You wanna hear my opinion? - You wanna hear my opinion, Mrs. Kim? Kim. - Okay, okay. My opinion is that you are a mean person. - Yeon, you know she's not... - I'm gonna tell her that. Next time I talk to her. I don't even care anymore, I'm just gonna say it. I'm gonna say it to her face. - That's right. I'm gonna say... - [cell phone buzzing] [clears throat] Mrs. Kim. Yes. [in Korean] Yes. [in English] No, no, no, no, no. No. That... That won't be a problem. No, no, of course. Of course. Thank you. I'm sorry. Thank you. Sorry. [cell phone clicks] Uh. Mrs. Kim just spoke to her architects. And, uh, she would like the roof to be slate now. [chuckles] She want the roof to... To be slate? Is that gonna be a problem? Pfft. What? Shit, man! Look, we've never worked with slate before. So what? We'll figure it out. What you mean, "So what"? Look, this isn't thermo PVC, okay? And you gotta take into account all breakages and fucking finding, uh... uh, bonding agents, all that shit. Come on, man. You gotta relax, everything's gonna be fine. What the hell do you mean, "It'll be fine"? I don't want it to just be fine. I want it to be perfect. If you try to get it perfect, you're just gonna fuck it up, playboy. Exactly why I never try. Shut the fuck up. Both of y'all, just-just shut up. Do me a favor, okay? Work out a new budget, add the slate in there, and give it to me tonight. Whoa. Tonight? Yes. Tonight. Okay, I wanna read all of it. No surprises, okay? - Marcus Parker? - [Fred] Okay. Just so you know, when you get the handouts tomorrow, skip over the last part. That's all fucked up now. What are you talking about? I got it in my hand here. Oh, no, you don't. We're tracking right here, it says it's still in Miami. What's this then? What the fuck. [Fred] Boss? - Cocaine. - Hey. - Oh! - Glad I caught you. Cau-Caught me doing... What'd you say? Listen, I just wanted to thank you for getting me home last night. Oh. Last night. Man, come on. That-That was nothing. - No-No big deal at all. - No, no, no. It is a big deal. [stammers] I shared some thoughts that were… out of line. Thoughts about my superior. Dude, I don't know what you're talking about. I don't even remember none of that shit, but... No, no, no. It was totally unprofessional and, uh… In fact, I don't even know why I said that. I don't know where it came from. I didn't mean it. Look, man. I-I'm not no snitch, okay? I ain't gonna tell on you. You good. - Really? - Yeah. Great, because the last thing I would ever want to do is put you in an embarrassing situation where you had... Oh. I'm-I'm sorry. I'm, like, totally crushing your package. You ain't crushing my package, 'cause that's not mine. - Whatever you're crushing, no, it's not... - Sorry, man. Gotta re-scan that. - Re-scan what? - Uh, your express pack. You know, the one you just signed for? - Oh. This? - There it is. Oh. [chuckles] You know something, I forgot... 'Cause I had to sign for this earlier for somebody else. 'Cause this not mine. - Know what I mean? - Wait. Are you not Marcus Parker? No. No, he is. I thought so. Well, all yours. Thank you. [whispering] Motherfucker. Is... Is everything okay? Mm-hmm. Cocaine! Your father sent me cocaine. Wow! This is way more than you've ever smuggled in your ass, babe. - It's a lot of cocaine. - There's like five pounds in there. - What? - [Maurillio] Marcus, why did you sign for five pounds of cocaine? Yeah, baby. Why did you do that? I didn't know it was cocaine in the package. When you sign for something, they don't tell you what's in there. Oh, God! That's like major trafficking. Like-like international... [snorts] Hey! What the fuck are you do... I didn't bring this to you to snort it. It is cocaine, Marcus. What are we... Are we not supposed to do it? No, motherfucker! No! - [snorts] - What the fuck are... You just heard me say some shit to him. Get rid of this shit right the fuck now. We got rid of a little bit. Yeah. And I think if we just keep plugging away, it'll be gone before we know it. What the fuck is wrong with y'all? Oh, great! Come on, Marcus. Now Kyla knows? It was supposed to be a surprise. What... Oh. [laughs] I'm sorry, Reese. Did I... Did I ruin your surprise? Wow! You wanna know who else was surprised? Come here. Me, motherfucker! I was surprised to get a package, and I almost opened that shit in front of Yeon! First off, you told me to put it in your name. I know what I said. Shut the fuck up. - Okay? - What? What? Marcus. Marcus! Baby, I am sorry, but I was fucking right! He almost blew the job for me, and I want him out of here. Matter of fact, this guy right here is a criminal. If you went to jail, you must have really did some shit. And, man, don't you give me that "innocent victim of the system" bullshit. - I am an innocent victim of the system... - I am an innocent... Shut the fuck up! Just admit it, you were using me to smuggle drugs. Marcus, that's not drugs. Kiss my ass, okay? If it's not drugs, then, Reese, what the fuck is it? Why does this coke not taste coke-y? Because it's your mom. Oh, my God! That's her? - Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! - Yes, Emily. Those are her mom's ashes. [Kyla] Oh, Mom! She died while he was in jail, and we didn't get a chance to spread her ashes around. Again, hated her, a witch. But I had them sent here so we could scatter them together. I just snorted your mom? I just did too. It's really kind of beautiful if you think about it. Well, I realize now I should've reminded you about it, but fuck, Marcus. I had no idea you'd rip it open and start chopping her up into lines. - Hey, hey. Look, man. - I mean... Now you can... I did some fucked... I said some mean... I said some really mean things, but I'ma tell you what I didn't do. I did not chop those white-woman ashes up. - That is what they did. I did not do that. - Look... [scoffs] Marcus, I know you're all stressed out before your million dollar meeting, but I was just trying to do something special for my daughter. Now it's ruined. Look, Reese, I... I-I didn't know it was a father-daughter moment, okay? I'm sorry. Yeah, well, hey, it's a little late for sorry. And to think I came in here to tell you all about this great day trip I booked. A day trip? Yeah, snorkeling. I found out about this secret spot that's supposed to be amazing. Ah, never mind, the vibe is too shitty now. No, hey! Reese, you stop that crazy talk, okay? Snorkeling is a great idea. - Right, Kyla? - Yeah, Dad. - Really. - Ah. Yeah. Right, Marcus? Right, Marcus? Right, Marcus? Right, Marcus? Aight, look, if y'all wanna go snorkeling, I'm in. Shit. - Yay! Everyone's happy again! - Fuck yeah! Let's do this! - Right. - [chuckles] Oh, my God, Dad! Look, I brought Mom. I thought we could spread her when we're done here. Or, you know, 99% of her. - That's great. - [Emily] Wait. Reese, hold up. We're flying in there? In that? - [Reese] Awesome, right? - Reese, no, I can't fly nowhere. I got a big meeting tomorrow I gotta prepare for. Well then you should thank me because we're gonna get there ten times faster. That is some great thinking, Reese. No seats! It's so rustic! [Reese] Come on, Marcus. I got it all handled. There's even a boat waiting for us and everything. Right, Captain? - [Kyla] I am so excited, Dad. - [Reese chuckles] You guys, it's gonna be so fun! [Reese] Oh, honey. Just wait until you get in the water. [ship horn blows] [siren wailing in distance] Reese, what the fuck is this? This place sucks! Think you gotta go out further. Yeah. Oh, I think I see some dolphins. - What? - Yeah, yeah. Go! We're just a happy family snorkeling. Nothing to see here. [Reese grunts, pants] - Is this all of them? - Nah, man. Me think there's one more. Hurry up, Jerome. Come on. [baby Marcus crying] [Maurillio] Okay, somebody's getting upset. Somebody's getting more upset, and… - Okay. Let's go wrap you. - [crying continues] [sighs, speaks in Spanish] [in English] I'm no killer. [in Spanish] [person, in English] Excuse me? I... Hi, I-I don't mean to be forward, I just... I have to tell you that I have never seen a man with a better touch with his baby than you. Oh, eh. Thank you, señora. - It's Veronika. - Ah. Thank you, Veronika. I am Maurillio. But this Caucasian baby is not mine. Seriously? Oh, yes. I have no children, uh, that I know of. I am kidding. I am childless. - Can I ask you a question? - Mm-hmm. Are you doing anything later? [groans] Oh, God, that was fucking disgusting. Wait, what is that shit? You mean the jellyfish? I saw all too clearly what it was. For recreational waters, these conditions are deplorable. I'm not talking about that. Wha-What Reese got going on? Fuck this. We are definitely gonna need tetanus shots. This is disgusting. [moans] - [Marcus groans] - [Reese] Hey. Sorry. I was just about to call you in. - [Marcus] Is that right? - Yeah. Visibility is not so great today, huh? - Reese, what are these bags? - What bags? "What bags"? You fucking with me... I'm talking about these bags here. - Oh, yeah. - Reese? Reese! Somebody's got eyes on us. [Reese] Ah, fuck! [Jerome] We gotta get moving, like, now! Okay, kids. Time to pack up and head out. Right now. Reese, seriously. What's in these bags? - Come on. - What's with the crazy rush? Oh, man. That's... It's a really funny story. - [Kyla] Oh? Tell me! - Oh, I will, baby. But on the way back, okay? Come on. - [Kyla] Okay. - [Ron] Hey, uh, don't we have to tie up the boat? No, Ron. It's okay, just leave it. All right, everybody in. We can catch that beautiful sunset, right? And dig into that fancy bottle of rum you bought. [Kyla] Oh, that sounds good! [engine sputters] Fuck! [in Spanish] Attention. This is the National Cuban Police. [in English] Oh, no. [in Spanish] You have entered Cuban territory. [in English] But who the hell are they? [Reese] Oh, yeah. Must be the local game wardens, and they... they are really strict about snorkeling in Cuba, so come on. Cuba. Hey! Fucker... You brought us to Cuba? Yeah, yeah. But it's okay. We just don't wanna deal with them. Come on. - Shit. - [engine sputters] [Reese] Jerome, please! I'm trying! Jerome? Reese? What? I do want to deal with them. That is the filthiest snorkeling site I've ever seen. - No, you really don't wanna... - [Ron] No, Reese. As a park ranger, it's not the first time I've had to call out the negligence of game wardens. - Kyla? My credentials? - Oh, got it. Got it, got it. Right here. - [engine sputtering] - [Cuban police continue indistinctly] Gentlemen! Over here! Just gonna find out who's in charge. Whoever is, is about to get their ass... Oh, shit! - Ron! You gotta get the fuck in here! - [Reese] Come on! Go! Go! [Jerome] Get in! Get in! - [Ron grunts] - [Kyla screams] - What is happening? - Why are they shooting at us? - What the fuck is going on? - [shouts] [Emily screams] Shit! - Can you take off already? - [Jerome] I can't. - We're too fucking heavy. - [Reese] What? Toss something! Now! [Kyla] What the... [Reese grunts] [groans] I love you, Mom! [sighs] And I came on this trip with all of these stupid expectations. Like, I'm a single woman, right? I'm available. Oh, you are more than available. You are ready to meet someone. What was I thinking? The reality is, I've barely left the resort all week. But then I saw you and... The world of possibilities just opened up? Yes! Exactly! - [laughs] Would you get out of my brain? - I don't want to. [both laughing] You know, I heard that the casino in town is supposed to be great. Coral Cay? Oh, yes. It's supposed to be magnificent. Well, then I guess there's just one thing left to ask. How much do you charge? I mean for the whole night. 'Cause if I'm going, I wanna go deep. Quick question. Uh, what exactly are you looking for? Hmm? Someone to watch my baby. - Baby? - Yeah! - Hi, little bubs. - Oh, look at that baby. [Maurillio] Oh. [gasps] Isn't he so cute? - [Maurillio chuckles] - [mumbles] Oh. I-I didn't even ask. How was the snorkeling? It was just okay. Fuck that! See what's in there... Hey, wait. What are you doing? Marcus, no, no, no. - [Marcus] What's in this bag, right... - Hey, no. Do not open that... Reese? Whose money is this, huh? Whose money is this? [screams] [engine sputters] Um. Shit, shit. I think we got a problem, brother. - They must've hit a fuel line. - The fuel line? [sighs] Don't tell me that's Lower St. James. [sighs] That's Lower St. James. [airplane engine sputtering] Okay, we cannot land there. [Jerome] No shit! [Reese] The hotel's just over that bridge. Turn, turn, turn. [Jerome] I got it! All right. Can you make it to the other side of the island? Yeah, man. Definitely. - [crashes] - [engine stops] [crashing] [Warren] Hold on right there. Now what the fuck was that? I could've sworn that was Jerome's plane. Jerome? [Marcus coughs] [Emily coughs] [Kyla coughs] [pants] That was not a fun crash. - [Emily grunts, pants] - [Reese grunts] Is everybody okay? I'm good. Everybody else? - [Kyla] Yeah. - [Reese] All good. - [Kyla] God, I keep... - [Reese] Except for Jerome. Oh, God, no. Did he not make it? Oh, he did. And he just fucked me out of a million bucks. What a dick. I thought we were friends! Okay, guys. That was a goddamn commotion. So, yeah, we should... We should get all our stuff and go. Shit! I have no bars. Fuck! - Baby. - Hey, where you going? - [Emily] Baby, wait. What is... - [Marcus] Shit. [Reese] Marcus, what are you doing? Something I should've did a long time ago is to call the cops on your ass. - Shit. I can't get a signal. - No, no. No cops. Will you listen to me? We need to get out of here. Look, I'm not fucking moving, okay? Until you tell us the truth, okay? Look, what is all this shit? Dad, there's gotta be, like, a perfectly innocent explanation for all this, right? Okay, fine. All right, look. I'm gonna give you the God's honest. All my cards, plunk, on the table. When I heard that I was gonna get out of prison, was my first thought to come see you? To belatedly celebrate my beautiful daughter's nuptials? - Yes. Yes, it was. - [chuckles] See? - Thank you. - [Reese chuckles] You know, me being away and out of your life. I just thought that there's no way I could ever make it up to you. But when I told the other guys in prison that I was headed for the Caribbean, well, this very nice dude named Frankie in D-block, he told me about a plane that went down in the waters off Cuba. - [Kyla] Hmm. - A plane containing five million dollars. And then I thought, boom! That's my big wedding present to you. Minus my cut, of course. That's so sweet. Kyla! What? He's being thoughtful. Thoughtful? Whose plane and whose money is this? - Is that really important right now? - It actually kind of is. Reese, whose fucking money is it? Huh? A drug dealer's. That... that guy, Warren. Warren, Warren, Warren. From the casino? [Reese] Yeah, can we get moving? Because that was a super loud crash. And trust me, Warren's gonna eventually find out where we are. - Wait, what? - What? Yes. Come on, can we just get the money out of the plane before he... [screams] Oh, my God. [Reese] Aw, I had it. I had it right in my hands. - [Warren] Over there! - Oh, fuck. It's Reese. I fucking knew it. - [Marcus scream] - [Emily] Shit! [screams] [all scream] - Go, go. - Let's get out of here. - Cut them off! - [shooter] Okay! Come on… We're on the move! - [Ron] Go! - [Kyla screams] [Emily] Go! Keep going! - [Ron] Go! - [Kyla screams] [Warren] Get them! [Marcus] Oh! [pants] Okay, the body's reaction to gunfire is a surge of adrenaline. It's good. Harness it. Just don't let it overwhelm you, you might give in to panic. [Marcus] Panic has already happened. What if I've already given in to panic? [cell phone rings] Zeke! Thank God! Zeke, listen to me! - Okay, so the slate's in the budget. - Listen! - But there's one little surprise. - Damn it! Shit, motherfucker! - Shut the fuck up! - Now this is probably gonna freak you out, - but I decided to change… - Zeke just... - …the font in one section. - Please... - I tried Helvetica, Times New Roman... - Shit! Listen! Motherfucker, shut up! - You don't understand! - No, no. Trust me. - It looks better bigger. - [Marcus screams] I don't give a fuck about that shit right now! …trying to fucking kill me... I lost him! Shit! So, how'd he take it? Hmm. Better than I thought. [Reese] Come on! [Emily screams] [Reese] Come on! [Kyla panting] [all panting] - [Marcus panting] - [Emily] Come on, baby. Hurry up! Come on. - Yo! Yo. - [Emily] Wait, what? - [whispers] Go, go, go, go. - [Emily pants] [Kyla] Go. [whispers] Get in there. Get... - [Reese stammers] - Okay. Shh, shh, shh, shh. [car engine stops] Now where the fuck did they go? - [cell phone chimes] - [automated voice] You are ovulating. [babies crying] [Maurillio panting] [groaning] [grunts] [in Spanish] - [knocking] - [sighs] [in English] Oh. Hey, Yeon. Come on in. Thanks. Uh… I just wanted to check in with Mr. Parker to see if he's, uh, okay with... Wait. Why are there two babies here? Yes. I am asking myself that very question. Okay, uh. Anyway, I just wanted to check in with Mr. Parker to see if he's feeling good about the presentation tomorrow. Because he seemed a little stressed this morning. Oh. Well he's still on his snorkeling trip. - Without me. - He went on a snorkeling trip? Mm-hmm. Without me. Huh. Well, then I guess he must have everything under control. [babies crying] I also have everything under control. [crying continues] [Reese] Look, Warren. I get it. I get it. You really want some answers here, but it's getting late. So I was thinking we just pick this up in the morning. Shut the fuck up! You're not so tough, when your muscle have an Uzi pointed at him. Eh? - Muscle? - Kyla, tell your dad to stop playing around. Dad. Why don't you honestly just tell him what happened? Yeah. Yeah, Reese. Tell me. Tell me where the fuck my money is! Warren, I-I am out of moves here, okay? I'm gonna give you the God's honest. All my cards, plunk, on the table. - [Warren] Mm-hmm. - Oh, not this. Did I intend to take your money? Yes. But then the Cubans showed up and started shooting up our plane. So, I... I never got to it. Your money is still down there. Under the water, where it's always been. So how about if I just give you the coordinates, all right? And then you guys can... can go get it, then we'll just... We'll call it a day. Yeah, okay. Look, here. I'm gonna write it down. Okay? Yeah, well… - See? He's so smart. - [whispers] Oh, God. [Reese grunts] [ship horn blows] [inhales sharply] You know something, right now… is about when I'd be running through my presentation for the last time. Then I'd call Zeke up, you know, yell at him to get the blood pumping, and then I'd put my suit on and... [chuckles] Make sure everything is right, look through the papers, make sure I got everything together… And then I'd go in the bathroom and look right in the mirror. And I'd tell myself, "You got this, playboy. You fucking got this." [scoffs, sighs] - [Emily] Hmm. - But instead… I'm in a fucking box. So thank you, Reese. Thank you so much. You're welcome. Really, Reese? Well, hey. I bought us a little time, didn't I? Look, if they find the plane, right? And see no money's in there, what the fuck you think is gonna happen, huh? Well, Marcus. I haven't figured that part out yet. - God. - You haven't figured that part out? Reese hasn't figured that part out yet. Wow. I mean, it feels like you just know all types of shit. But you... But you haven't figured that part out yet? Great job. Marcus, I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic, but I don't think there's any reason to make my dad out to be the bad guy here. But he is the bad guy. What did you just say? Kyla, Marcus is right. Reese is the bad guy here. Ever since he showed up, he turned this relaxing family vacation into chaos. Total chaos. Who does that? [huffs] - Kyla. - Yeah? Kyla, there's something I need to say to you, and... It is not gonna be easy to hear. - But I'm gonna say it anyway. - Okay. You know how everybody likes me? Everyone on planet Earth. Everybody does. Except for your father. [scoffs] What? - That's impossible. - That's not all. You know how I like everyone? Everyone you've ever met. There is a small piece of me… [sighs] - …that doesn't like him. I said it. - [gasps] Ron! Well, I guess that evens things out then. What the hell's your problem, Reese? It's like everything out of your mouth's an insult to me. - Like you're in some contest with me. - Uh. It's hardly a contest. - Guys, you don't... - Wanna know what I think? You're the one who feels inadequate. I think you feel threatened by me. - Ron! - What are you now, a therapist? This is not the moment - to have this conversation... - The only time you were even remotely nice to me was when you were using me at the casino. - 'Cause you needed me to be your muscle. - Fuck. Hey. You should be flattered. At least it's a step up from being a fucking park ranger. Fuck you! How dare you belittle that hallowed position! Take it back, right now! - Take what back? - Take it back, or there's gonna be - some fucking consequences... - Stop! Both of you! Stop! We are family whether you like it or not, you assholes. We are going to get out of here. And tomorrow we're gonna be sitting on the beach, sipping cocktails, having a great time. So sit the fuck down! And remember, everything is gonna be okay. [Marcus] What the fuck was that? - Oh, my God! - [Reese] Uh... We're moving! [Kyla, Emily clamoring] [muffled shouting] All right, what's the word? It's definitely our plane. It's right where the guy said it would be. We're diving down now to get the money. All right. We're done with them. [creaking] [all scream] [Kyla screams] Are you okay? [Reese] What the... - [Kyla] They dropped us in the ocean? - [Reese] Don't worry. Don't worry. [muffled shouting] - [Marcus] Why's this thing moving? - [Emily] What's happening, baby? - It's filling up with water. We sinking? - [Reese] It's all right. We're sinking! [Kyla] It's coming in fast. Relax, relax. We're not sinking, okay? These things can float for days. How the fuck do you know that? Imports, exports, remember? I'm telling ya, as long as we're floating, we're fine. - [screams] - Damn it! - [Reese grunts] All right. Help! - [Kyla] Let us out right now! Help! I thought you said these things don't sink, Reese! - [Kyla] Hey! - Hey! Hey! - [pounding] - [muffled shouting] [Marcus] Help us! Get us out of here! [Kyla] My God! - [Emily] Help! Help! Help us! - [Reese] You hear us? Ron! You gotta help us, man! - Tell us what to do! - [Ron] One thing left to do. - [Kyla] Goddamn it! Help! - [Emily] Get us out of here! That's what you're gonna do right the fuck now? - [Reese] Let us out! - Old park ranger trick. Used to teach it to all the kids. - Help! - You taught the kids to smoke weed? [Ron] No, I didn't teach them to smoke weed. I taught them if you're ever stuck in a cave, find any incendiary material, light it, and let the smoke lead you out. - [Emily screams] - [Kyla] Oh, my God! 'Cause it always finds a way out. [Emily cries] Please! There. The weak point. It's right there. - Get ready. - To do what? Just float. [grunts, strains] - [straining] - Come on, baby! Something supposed to happen? Because... Yes, it was. And I don't understand why it didn't. That's more than enough force to breach corroded steel. Here comes another flood of bullshit. It's not bullshit, Reese. It's basic physics. The pressure differential in here is much more... [all shout] [Marcus grunting] [Reese groaning] [coughs] - Everybody's here, holy shit! - Dad! - We made it! - [Reese] Yeah. There! Go, go. Go, go, go! - You need to pull me in. Please. - I... Okay, okay. - [singers] ♪ Get up Edina girl ♪ - [singer] ♪ A let me tell you now ♪ ♪ Get up Edina Get up Edina girl… ♪ Ron! You're a fucking genius! Yeah, Ron. Now can you hot-wire one of these cars? I don't know how to do that. Pfft. Some genius, huh? I mean that's like a basic life skill. Okay. First, it's stealing. - Second... - [engine starts, revs] Dad, did you see that? There you go, baby. You remembered like I taught you! What? Wait. Wait. What do you mean all of the money's gone? The every last bag? [beeping] Uh. Where is my car? [Kyla, Emily laughing] - [Marcus laughs] - [Ron] Is anyone back there? No, baby. We're good. We made it. [laughs, speaks indistinctly] Oh, my fucking God. Wait, wait, wait. What time is it? - What time is it? - Uh. Oh. Here, look. Uh. 8:48. Wow. Eight forty... Baby, you can still make it! [Marcus] Wait, what? Y-You think? Okay. We're not far, we're not far. Shit, shit! I gotta get my focus on. Okay, okay. Uh. Parker Construction, uh, was founded in 2007, by this kid who knows Chicago better than anyone. That kid is-is Marcus Parker. - Honey? - I see it, babe. Thank you. - [engine revs] - [all scream] [horn honks] They're right there. That's them. It has to be them. Merge left. Merge left! Ron! The hotel's right to the left! Oh, shit, Ron! We're actually gonna make it. I can't believe you did this, man. You know, sometimes I don't believe you, but I'm like, "You know something, this dude is a fucking amazing... What the fuck? [all scream] Goddamn, Warren. [chuckles] Great... Great to see you, Mrs. Kim. You know the idea is to avoid the bullets, right? Dad! Leave Ron alone. - He's doing actually a really good job! - I'm not criticizing. - I'm just saying. - Not helping! Shut the fuck up! Okay. All right. Unless you got something you absolutely have to say before we die, don't say shit at all! - I don't wanna have a baby! - Wait, what? I'm sorry, Marcus. I love you so much, and I know we talked about it, but I just don't. You know what's crazy? I don't wanna have a baby either. What? Yeah, look, I didn't know how to tell you. But-But the ovulation tracker, you were all in. That shit was for you. I didn't wanna do that. Baby, I like kids, but, baby, I just love the way our life is right now. - [tires squeal] - [Reese screams] - Not necessarily right now but you get it. - I'm so happy for you guys! Oh, yeah. Me too. Now hold on. - No, no, no, no! We're not gonna make it! - [all scream] - [tires squeal] - [horns honk] [tires screech] [Warren] Move it! Move! [Reese] Holy shit! You did it, Ron! You actually fucking did it! [all screaming] [screaming continues] This-This font is quite nice, don't you think? [grunting, shouting] [panting] [Emily] Is everyone okay? - Are we good? - Is everyone all right? - Go! Come on! Go, go, go, go. - [Marcus grunts] Fuck. Raise your fucking hands. Oh, God. This is bad. Kyla, this is really, really bad. Hold on. Hold on. Ron has, like, a really good touch with drug dealers. Hands up higher, you pussy. - Kyla. - [pants] What? Drug dealers! - Oh, my God. This is it. Come with me. - Where are you... - Maurillio! - Maurillio! Maurillio! - [babies crying] - [Kyla] Maurillio! [cooing] - Where is he? Fuck! Is he here? - [Emily] Check upstairs... - In here. - Oh, my God. Come on. Okay. [panting] - Why are there two babies in here? - Because I am very clearly not a killer. No, no, no. But you are. You're Novar. Chencho Novar! Wait. What? You have one last chance. Reese, where is my money? Pfft. You mean it wasn't on the plane? You know, salt water is pretty corrosive, so maybe... Okay, it's torched. All of it, torched. Believe me, I am more bummed about this than you are. You sure are. You sure fucking are. [Maurillio] Gentlemen. May I ask you to put your guns down? [mouthing] What are you doing? Who the fuck are you? - [muttering] - Go! You know my name. Perhaps all too well. For I am Novar. Chencho Novar. You're not no fucking Novar. But I am. You see… nobody knows what I look like for a reason. Unlike you, who is known by so many, Warren. How you know my fucking name, eh? How do I know his name? You may run this island. You may know everything that goes on here. But me? I know everything that goes on everywhere. So if I were you, I would let my friends go. Friends? - They're with you? - Oh. Yeah. Hey, Novar. We're totally with him. Because if you do not release them, well, the consequences will be most unpleasant. Violence… she is my sweet lover. Uh. Too... too much Maurillio. Too... too much. I know, he needs to pull back. Perhaps you've seen some of my cruel handiwork in Cartagena? Hmm? The bag of heads in Caracas? No, you back there with the BO I can smell from here? Well, they made the most impressive documentary about it. You should check it out. But that? That will be nothing, Warren. If you do not heed my warning, this quaint island of yours will endure horrors you can't imagine. The streets bathed in crimson. Severed heads affixed upon all manner of public signage. The entrails of your beloved ones strewn across the room... Ch-Ch-Ch-Chencho? Well, you get the point. All right. Fine. These two can go. [whispering] You smart fucking lady. Honestly, me don't know who the fuck them is anyway. And I definitely don't give a fuck who you is. But Reese. Reese, I want five million for him. Or him dead. Five million dollars? Pfft. No problem. [inhales deeply] Does anybody have five million dollars? I do. [Marcus] What? No. Seriously, I do. I believe you have my phone. What you want your phone for? So I can wire you the money. You... I mean, you can watch. What... What is he doing? What's Ron doing? I don't know. - What kind of bullshit is he pulling? - I don't know what the fuck he's doing. - [cell phone chimes] - Yeah. - All right. We're good here, guys. - [Warren's guy] Yep, move on. - Okay. - Oh, my God! [Emily] What! What? - Ron, what the fuck did you do? - [Kyla squeals] You're a genius! [squeals] Baby! I'm so proud of you! - Ron, what the fuck was that? - I just paid the man. With what? Where'd you get five million dollars from? Check this out. What the hell is Secure Commerce for Online Markets? SCOM-coin! Wait, wait, wait. - That crypto thing? That was real? - [Ron] Yeah. Took Reese up on his hot tip. Yesterday morning I invested 30K and it 200x-ed by lunch. Oh, my God. - You're such a genius. - Whoa, whoa. You-you paid five million bucks for me? To save my life? [sighs] What can I say? Kyla was right. We are family. Seriously, son. Salaam. [whirring] - Baby. Go! - Shit! I gotta... - Go! - Go! Mrs. Kim! Mrs. Kim! Wait. Hey, hey, hey! You stop that! You stop the helicopter! [panting] Cut it off! Okay, Mrs. Kim. - [pants] I really need you to hear me out. - I'm sorry, Mr. Parker. I have another meeting. Now if you will excuse me. Okay, no! No! No. I-I don't... I don't mean to yell but I-I can't excuse you. Understand this, me and my friends have been through hell to get here. Hell! Okay? So this has to happen. And if I can be honest with you, I don't give a fuck no more. All right? So if you can, just stand there in your... In your perfect outfit and your very comfortable heels and beautiful steamed blouse. And just hear me out. Please! Please. I got something I gotta say. Which is? Pretend like I have a clicker 'cause I had a whole slideshow. [blows] Parker Construction was founded in 2007, - by a kid... - Stop! Mr. Parker. In the silence of that empty conference room, I was able to digest your written budget, which was quite thorough. But I didn't become head of my company by just analyzing numbers. I did it by listening to my gut, Mr. Parker. Do you know what my gut is telling me right now? That-that, um... That your gut likes... Likes Parker Construct... It's telling me… I flew you out here, put you up for a week, had my staff tend to your every need, and yet you still left me sitting there for 12 full minutes. Now I don't care if you were held at gunpoint, or if... Okay, I'm glad you brought that up 'cause that actually just happened - two minutes ago right over there... - The point… is that my gut is never wrong. So, I'm quite certain you are not the man for this job. I have a different opinion. What did you just say? I have a different opinion. Oh. Baby. Okay, so… - He got the job. - I got the fucking job. - [Emily] You got the job? - I got the fucking job. - [Emily] Yes! Baby! - Fuck yeah, Marcus! - [Maurillio] Oh! [laughs] - [Kyla] Yes! We knew you could do it! I didn't, but yes! [sighs] Baby, I am just so proud of you! You know something? Honestly, if it wasn't for Yeon, I wouldn't have the job. He... He really vouched for me, you know? [sighs] Yeon. Thank you, brother. Yeah. Turns out my opinion actually does matter. This calls for a celebration. Right? And when we get some drinks, I'm going to be the first one to raise my glass to... Oh, my God! The babies. [Ron] I fucking love this little guy. - [Kyla chuckles] - He's a little genius. You guys have any second thoughts? - I'm good, you good? - I'm Gucci. - Oh, no, we good. - We're great, thank you though. Hey, hey. But little Marcus can come visit us anytime he wants to. Absolutely. I mean, we may even know of a hotel where you guys can stay at in Chicago. [Marcus] Mm-hmm. We may have an idea. So, Reese. What are you gonna do next? Well, actually, uh. I think I'll be heading back up to San Francisco for a bit. For, like, ten to 20 years. Dad! What? Aw, honey. I am so goddamn grateful I got to spend time with you. But there's one thing that I haven't exactly been straight with you about. You do like to shit in front of people? No, no. It's... It's just that I wasn't really paroled, like I told you. I kinda broke out. Which was stupid, I know. But it was worth it. I got to see you. You and your family. All of you. Reese Hackford? That's me. - FBI. Hands behind your head, please. - [agent] Everybody, step back. - Come on. - Thanks for having me, honey. - [Reese] I hope I didn't ruin everything. - Dad, are you kidding? I got to snort my own mom. This was the best honeymoon ever. - And Ron… - Down on the ground. …you were right. [grunts] I was threatened by you. But you know why? Because you're great. In all the ways that I'm not. And that's a lot of fucking ways. Sorry I was such a dick. And the truth is I couldn't imagine a better son-in-law. [agent] Come on. Get up. - I don't know what to say. - [chuckles] Except for when our kid gets married, I hope I'm the type of father that would break out of prison to face another ten to 20 years just to see him. - [agent] Time to go. Let's move. - [police radio chatter] So nice to meet you both. - And you too, Chencho. - Hmm? - Okay. It's just a joke. It's a joke. - [agent] Come on, let's go. [Kyla] I love you so much, Daddy. Have a great flight. What are we doing tonight? It's our last night in the Caribbean. Well, I have a date. With who? - With her. Veronika. - [Emily] Oh. I finally found the nerve to ask her out to dinner. You see, playing a drug dealer almost may have gotten us shot in the face, but it also unleashed something inside of me. Apparently, I can be the killer after all. Till tomorrow. [squeals, laughs] [Emily] All right, Chencho. [Maurillio] Hi. [chatters] So what about us, you guys? Should we get some drinks? Yeah. We should definitely get drinks and dinner. And maybe, like, the casino after? Girl, you know I'm not allowed back in there. Like, ever. You know what, you guys go ahead. I have some unfinished business to attend to. [blows]
