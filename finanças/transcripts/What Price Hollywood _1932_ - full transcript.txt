Clark, how I love you, my darling. I love you. I do. It's getting late and I must scram. Goodbye, my love. Goodbye, my darling. Hello, sugar. Say, do you want to go in pictures? I've just written a great part for a girl like you. Why don't you stick to blackmailing. You want me to call Nick over? - Sure. Call him over and tell him about that 17-year old girl you put in pictures. I've got a name. I'm box-office. Was I drunk and was she ..? What a beautiful girl. Why aren't you in the movies, dear? That's what I wonder myself. You are the prettiest girl we've seen. That is awfully sweet of you. You'll see me in pictures someday. That's my price. I just finished a personal tour on the bowsy-wowsy circuit and I am box office. I got box office sticking out all over me. So long. Well, what have you got? I got box-office, too. I want some cold cuts. A lot of ham. Girly, would you mind leaving that phone here. Women are getting fed up with the blond type. I said, Latin types are coming back. Look at Clark Gable. He's through. An order of cold cuts for Mr Box-Office. You bet. Hey, listen. Latin types are coming back again. I just heard that big producer cracking to his yes-man. What did I tell you? You can fool some of the people all the time .. But you can't never fool the American women. They want sophisticated love. I'll take vanilla. Good evening, Mr Carey. Gardenia, Mr Carey? Gardenia for your buttonhole, Mr Carey? I'll buy them all. - All of them? Yes, mother. And I'll corner the gardenia market. No-one will have any and I'll get all the girls. You don't need a gardenia to get the girls, Mr Carey. No? Just for that I will send you home in my car. Oh, Mr Carey. Thanks so much, Mr Carey. James, take the young lady home, will you. There you are. Don't forget me in your next picture, Mr Carey. I'd be another Marie Dressler. - I wouldn't be surprised. Thanks, Max. Well, one for you. No. Who is he, dear? Maximilian Carey, the great director. His picture opens at Grauman's Chinese tonight. Oh, I wonder if he could put us in one of his pictures? Hello. There you are. Hello. How are you? I beg your pardon, old man. Pardon me. Who is your tailor? I hear you got a great picture, Max. - Anything new? Look. That's for you. - Mr Carey, I .. Congratulations, Mr Carey. - What for? What for? Your picture opens tonight. It's very sweet of you to say that. Look. He's going into one of your booths. Let me wait on him, will you. Well .. - I gave you Wally Beery last week. Well okay, What about the tip? Oh you can have the tip. I'm not interested in that. I'm looking for a break and I'm going to get it. Wait a minute. Don't do that. The last tablecloth I ate on was 10,000 dollars short. I want six glasses of water. Six separate glasses of water. Going to a fire? - No, wait a minute. Six glasses of water and one pot of coffee. Have a seat. How about giving me a full page Ad for the new picture, Carey? Every hour that you're out of jail you are away from home. Somebody has been knocking me to you. That's wasn't necessary. Hello, sugar. You see those two lovely old ladies over there? Well, take these over to them, will you. I hear you've got a wow of a picture. I'll bet they count the silver every time you eat here. Mr Carey sent you these. Would you take this and go to the opening? Okay, if that's the way you feel. Hello. Give me Vanson 1-0-2-5. What's a pretty girl like you doing around here? Waiting to meet a big director like you. What you need is a couple of straws. You'd better get me the straw that broke the camel's back. Hello? Hello, sweetheart. Believe it or not, you'll never guess where I am. You don't give a what? Well, neither do I. Operator. Now did I say anything to offend the lady? No. I think you were awfully sweet to her. That's just it. I'm sweet. I made an engagement to take a lady to the opening .. And I forgot to get her and she forgot to be a lady. Mr Carey, people don't realize that you're a genius. I proposed to a woman once for saying just that. She turned around and sued me. - For being a genius? No. For fifty grand. Well don't you let anyone kid you, Mr Carey. You've got a lot on the ball. You know, you are the smartest girl I've met here tonight. When I came in, I asked for six glasses of water and you didn't ask me why. Or did you? There is something want you to do for me now and I don't want you to ask me why. Listen. Get me a taxi. - Yes, sir. - That's the boy. If she turns over, I'll by it. How much? Would 35 be too steep? Make it 50 and I'll take it. Hey, what is this, a gag? - No. You're not taking me just for a laugh? No. Come on, get in. You know the motto of Hollywood. It's all in fun. Alright. I'll hold it together while you drive. Ladies and gentlemen it's a pleasure to introduce the producer of a great epic. Mr Julius Saxe, the owner of Saxe Super Productions. Hello everybody. I am very proud of this picture of mine. As a matter of fact I am very proud to be .. The head of an organisation hat produces pictures like this. Oh, look at them! This clown is going to spoil my entire opening. Your contract, Mr Carey. - I don't want it. But you can't leave your car there, sir. - It's yours. Well, I have a car, Mr Carey. - I know, but this one is paid for. I take pleasure of introducing my genius director. Mr Maximilian Carey. Maxy. Say a few of words over the microscope. - Delighted. Ladies and gentlemen, I owe my entire success. To beef, iron and wine. Pardon the static, ladies and gentlemen. That was not static. And now I want to introduce my guest of the evening. The Duchess of Derby. Hello everybody. Sorry we're so terribly late but we've so many guests for dinner this evening. Some of your charming Hollywood stars. Goodnight. I must go now. Mr Carey is waiting and there is nothing so exasperating as waiting on people. I ought to know. [ Telephone ] [ Telephone ] [ Telephone ] Yes sir, Mr Saxe. He's still sleeping. Oh no, no, no. He's not unconscious. He's sleeping like a baby. Yes, sir. I'll give him all of your messages as soon as he wakens. Yes, sir. Good morning, Mr Carey. Mr Saxe called several times. He seemed in a terrible temper. Well I hope he has apoplexy. Hey, James. James, will you see if I've cut my foot. I'm afraid to look. I don't see any cuts, sir. Would you mind .. reading that fan letter for me. Mary Evans: 5 foot 4 inches. Weight: 102 lbs. Complexion: blond. Telephone: Gladstone 5309. Sings and swims. Rides horseback. I wonder who ..? - It must have been the young lady. Young lady? Did I bring someone home with me last night? No, sir. Someone brought you home this morning. She is downstairs asleep. I must get a dressing-gown. What's new? Did you have a nice sleep? I haven't been asleep very long. I've been out on your veranda. Looking at the city lights. Gee, it's swell up here on the mountain. It?s so .. So fresh. Pardon me, but .. what really happened last night? Oh, nothing much. You just passed out in the middle of the picture. That's all. Was it that bad? - Oh no. It was well directed. But that dame, was she leg-conscious. Excuse me, sir. But it is Mr Saxe again. He asks what you're doing. Why James, you tell him we're having a wonderful time. We wish he were here. And I'll write him .. later. Yes, sir. Thank you. May I ask you something very personal? What have I got to lose? Just where and how did I meet you? At the Brown Derby. I bought you from another waitress. You bought me? Oh of course. You work there, don't you. I did. But I gave up my job for you palsy-walsy. I suppose you'd like to know how I got here? Yes. Well, I brought you home in a cab. The driver and I carried you up this mountain. And all you did was yodel. A great help. So I yodelled, eh? Yodel-o-dee .. And you were so charmed with my yodelling you couldn't leave me? No. I'm looking for a break in pictures. I thought you might give me a chance. What do you know about that? Why, I'm no wise guy, but I believe in myself. All I need is a break. Why do you drink all the time? Can't you cut the heavy swilling? What, and be bored all the time? Did you ever work in pictures? - Not yet. But I hang around all the casting offices. Say. Could you write a letter for me? I'll do better than that. You're a great kid. So I yodelled, eh? I didn't try anything else? I mean .. I know what you mean. No. And it was a novelty. I must be slipping. Well I tell you, you come around the studio tomorrow and come on my set. Great! Now, you are going home. Let me give you a tip about Hollywood. Always keep your sense of humor. And you can't miss. Don't worry about me. I got a great sense of humor. Good. I'll give you my private telephone number. It is .. well, I've forgotten. But it doesn't matter. You will find it listed in the book under the name of my Chinese cook. Hip Sing Long. You think I'm screwy, don't you. No. I know you're screwy. Hello. Yodello .. Alright, Mr Carey. Quiet everybody! Quiet! Turn them all off. Cameras. But I saw you kiss her. - I was sorry for her. I'd do the same for any girl. Alright. Cut. How is that for sound? - Okay, sound. That's all for today. Get the car. I'll be right out. Oh, Mr Carey. Here I am. Mary Evans. You know, Yodeleoo. Oh, it's you. Oh, Jimmy. - Yes, Mr Carey? I want Miss Evans for that bit on the stairs. Take her to wardrobe, get her a smart frock. Have her made up on the set at 8 tonight. Thank you, Mr Carey. Come on. Snap out of it. Hello Buzzy. You haven't proposed to me yet tonight. Come on, kid. Say, you look okay. What did I tell you? I'm good. - Let's get going. Come on, kid. Come on. Here she is, Mr Carey. Oh, how are you? Well, you know what you do? Yes, sir. I think so. That's fine. Do you know your lines? Yes. "Hello Buzzy. You haven't proposed to me yet tonight." That's right. We'll rehearse this once and then we'll take it. Now you go about halfway up that stair. And Mr Reeve. Will you .. just stand here lightly. You know .. limp. Sure. Now .. come on. Hello Buzzy, you haven't proposed to me yet tonight. Now you see the dead body. What is it, Rosemary? Are you ill? Yes. Come, dear. Let me show you something. Look. Now when you come down the stairs. Come down. Easily. Gracefully, see. Lightly. No, don't put your hand on the railing. You are sober. Now remember, you're a pretty girl and this poor sap will propose to you. So give it some zip, some animation. Now come on. Yes, sir. - Try it once again. Now come on. No, no. Not on your heels. And don't clench your hands that way. This is a love scene, not a fight. Yes, sir. - Now, come on. Now come on, be gay about it. Hello Buzzy, you haven't proposed to me yet tonight. What is it Rosemary? Are you ill? Wrap it up. We'll take it the first thing in the morning. I think you'd better get me another girl. Mr Carey. I wasn't very good, was I. - That's alright. Don't be discouraged. Keep in touch with me. I'll have something for you someday. I can do better tomorrow. Well, that reminds me. You gave up your job, didn't you. Well, here is some money and .. You will get along fine. - No thanks. I have plenty of money. Goodnight. - Goodnight. Let me know what's new. Hello, Mary. How did you get along at the studio today? Fine, Mrs Lambert. How did it go? I ..

Hello Buzzy, you haven't proposed to me yet tonight. Lousy. Hello Buzzy. You haven't proposed to me yet tonight. Hello, Buzzy. You haven't proposed to me yet tonight. Yes, Miss Evans. Uhuh. Yes. Uhuh. You'll do it wonderful now. Alright. I'll tell him. Say, Mr Carey. That Miss Evans has been calling for hours. She says she can come down the steps perfectly. And she'll be a knockout if you'll only let her do it. What will I tell her? - Yodelodee. - Yes, sir. He said for you to come to the studio tomorrow morning. Yes, Miss. What's going on here? What is it? Lights! Who are you? What are you doing here? Who let you in? Get out! I'm sorry. - Go ahead, Miss Spiegel. Don't be sorry. Go ahead. - Go on with the rushes. Let me see it. Pardon. Could I ..? - Surely. Come on in. Hello, Buzzy. You haven't proposed to me yet tonight. What is it, Rosemary? Are you ill? They are showing my scene. Hello, Buzzy. You haven't proposed to me yet tonight. What is it, Rosemary? Are you ill? Terrific! Lights. Who is that gorgeous creature? That's the little girl you just threw out of here. Send her up immediately. Make a note of this Miss Spiegel. Yes, sir. - Maybe she is a great discovery. She has something. Where is that girl? Find her and bring her back immediately. I'm here, Mr Saxe. Come in, come in. Here I am, sir. - Hello. Let me look at you. Fine. Gentlemen. Sit down. Well, what is your name? - Mary Evans. Mary Evans. No good. Go and change it. Mary is a grand old name, Saxy. Alright. We'll keep it. Well, Mary. I tell you what I'll do. I'll give you a contract. A long term contract for seven years. I'll give you the first year 150. The second year 200. A week. The third year, 300 and so on .. Until in seven years you will make a million dollars. That will be wonderful. Miss Spiegel, get my mother on the phone. I want to tell her I have discovered a new star. Who discovered a new star? Alright. Maximilian Carey discovered a new star. You are welcome. Now Mary .. I'll you what I want you to do. I want you to meet all the heads of my departments. Gentlemen, I want you to meet our new star. Mary Evans. - How do you do, Miss Evans. Well gentlemen, I'll tell you what I want you to do. We must start a national publicity campaign about Miss Evans. We must make her .. A typical American girl. I got it. We make her "America's Pal". That's it. - Right. Well gentlemen, you've done very well. Very well. Well, I want to talk to you about Mary. I'll do everything I can for your little lady. I am. I'm in pictures. Mr Carey. I'm in pictures. Well, don't blame me. Goodbye, Mary. I want to talk to you Maxy. Goodbye, Mr Saxe. Goodbye, Mr Carey. Thank you. Goodbye, Mary. Careful about your options. Carey, I like you. You are a fine director, Carey. Alright, what have I done now? - That's it. I'll tell you. Carey, you are slipping. All the time with the bottle. All the time you are drunk. No longer do you care whether the films are good. No longer do you care whether the film is being wasted. All the time, retakes. All the time, over schedule. You're right. Now let's see. Who do we get to replace me? Now listen, I am saying that to you for your own good. You are even losing your memory with this drinking business. You are getting crazy. It's not good. You've got to stop it. Look here, five years ago you were ten years ahead of the business. And now you're not quite even with it. And what is the answer? Whiskey. You're right. What the picture business needs is light wines and beer. Oh, you. Bonita. Bonita. I'm all that way about one of those Polo players out there. Baby, can he ride. Hello, Mr Saxe. Hello, Mary. How are you? - Fine. You are going to have some wonderful riding in your first starring picture. Yeah. - All the society thoroughbreds. Who is the one playing number 2? That's the millionaire playboy. Lonnie Borden, the best Polo player in America. A fine man. - Married? Strictly a breach-of-promise man. Bring him over. - He won't come. He won't come? Why? Well I just caught him saying that he is fed up with all these Hollywood blonds. So he's fed up is he. He must be. He says they all make him sick. Hey, Jimmy! Jimmy, where is Mr Carey? Bonita. Ouch! Say. Does this thing belong to you? - Yes, but you can have it. I've just had it and I don't want it. And furthermore I don't think it was cute or clever idea. I haven't the faintest idea what I've done, but I think you don't love me. You'd be surprised to know what I really think of you. Surprise me. Tell me. No. Not in front of the horse. - Oh, he's been around. Anything .. anything wrong? So you're not a Polo player? - Huh? All Polo players have swelled heads and bow legs and your legs aren't bowed. But the head is big enough? - Colossal. Now would you mind keeping this thing? I don't like being hit by Polo balls. Besides, it isn't in my contract. Oh, so that's it. I hit you, huh? Yes. And the impression was not favorable. Well I'll try to be sorry. - Don't go to tall that trouble. Look here, I tell you what you do. Just to even things up. Suppose you hit me? I don't care to hit you. Oh, please. Come on. - I haven't time. You mean, you haven't the nerve. Now then, are you going to ask for any more favors? - Yes. How about dining with me tonight? Come on, now. Come on. Where shall we dine? I don't even know you, Mr Borden. - My name is Borden. How do you do. - How are you? Bonita, bring me my script. I want to study my lines. Well, where shall we dine? Perhaps you haven't noticed I'm a blond. A Hollywood blond. Yes. I had noticed. Shall we say 8:30? I'm sorry, but I don't like to be bored. Oh, I guarantee that you won't be bored, Miss Evans. Besides, we'll have a dinner that you will tell your grandchildren about. That kind of dinner would take more imagination than you've got, Mr Borden. Oh, I've got a lot of imagination, Miss Evans. As a matter of fact I'm doing some very pleasant imagining right now. Bonita, bring me a cigarette. Look, shall we get a private dining-room at the hotel? You know, just you and I? No, I'm afraid not. You see. I'm used to the main dining-room with all the other guests excluded. Alright then. The main dining-room it shall be. What else do you usually have? Well .. a 30-piece orchestra. That's easy. Anything else? Well, I never dine without .. A gold dinner service. And decorations of orchids. Gold service. Decoration of orchids. My idea exactly. And of course, something amusing to do. Well, we might eat? Some people do. Alright. We'll eat. Caviare, terrapin, roast pheasant and champagne. Of course, if it's difficult to get. Not in the least, Miss Evans. Not at all. We will .. we will eat at 8:30. By midnight you will have forgiven me. By midnight I will have forgotten you. Say, how long are we going to stall around here? I think that guy is nuts. Your lady is a little late, isn't she, Mr Borden. Yes, Oscar. Yes. Mr Borden. Miss Evans sent you this note. Oh, thank you. [ Door knocks ] Who is it? Who is it? It's me. Let me in! [ Door knocks ] Don't be silly. Go away. Are you going to open this door or shall I break in? Run along, little boy. I'm in bed. Are you crazy? What are you doing? I'm going to take you to dinner. Oh you are, are you? Like this I suppose? Unless you want to dress in a hurry. - Sorry, I don't intend to dress at all. That's okay with me. - You wouldn't dare! Stop that, stop it. Get away from me. How dare you! Stop it! Let me down! Let me down will you! I want to get some clothes. Put me down or I'll scream. Go ahead! This is a swell story for the newspapers. You're insane. You can't take me in the dining room. Put me down. I'm cold. Well, we'll soon take care of that. Here. This will keep you nice and warm. Without destroying the delightful simplicity of your costume. Now. Do you prefer to walk the rest of the way? Or shall I carry you? Oh .. you prefer to be carried. You can't pick me up again. You wouldn't do this if I were a man. - I wouldn't want to. Let me down will you! I hate you! You are a swine. Let me go! Please let me down. Let me go! Will you walk in nicely? - Yes, I will. I hate you! Alright, Oscar. - Yes, Mr Borden. Caviare? I don't care for any. But you ordered it. Didn't I tell you, I don't care for any! Must I resort to forcible feeding? Are you going to eat this? Or must I rub it in? Come on, be a nice girl. You are going to eat it and like it. There, there. There. That's a nice girl. Chew it up nice and fine now. The orchestra leader asks if there is music you wish him to play, Mr Borden. Is there anything special that you wish to hear? Yes! A good funeral march! - A charming thought. Can you ask him if he knows a good funeral march? - Yes, sir. And the champagne, Oscar. - Yes, sir. Charming of you to dine with me tonight, Miss Evans. May I drag you to lunch tomorrow? A pleasure, Mr Borden. By that time I will have a new window for you to break. Oh, now look here, Mary. Don't you think it is about time that you started being nice? Well. Isn't it about time you apologised? Well, do it then. Alright. I do. I apologise. Sorry you took me out of bed and dragged me here? Yes, honestly I am. To prove it to you I'll take you right straight back. No. I think I will stay here a while. Oh, well that is grand. Oh, you win. I've never had a more divine dinner in my life. Neither have I. Have you always been insane? Or is this just a recent attack? Well the attack hit me this afternoon on the Polo field. Up to that moment, I had been a perfectly sane conventional citizen. The champagne has gone to my head and the music to my feet. Well that is grand. Shall we dance? Lonnie. Yes, dear? One of us has got to be sensible. Well, it's not going to be me. Lonnie. Yes, dear? I must go home. Well, you can go home. I mean alone. You're not afraid of me, are you? Well. I'd be kind of silly if I weren't. Laugh this off. What is it? Is it a present or did you pay for it yourself? It's an engagement ring. What? It can't be possible. Who is going to be foolish enough to marry a picture star? Lonnie Borden. Mr Borden? Well, well, well. What a surprise. Hello Mr Borden. - How do you do? Allow me to congratulate you. Thank you very much. - And I want you to know. That Mary is a very fine girl. I love her, Mr Borden. I am her father confessor. She tells me everything. Well. When do you think you are going to do it? In about two weeks at the little church around the corner. Little church? Little church, nothing. The biggest church in Beverly Hills. Miss Spiegel. Get me all the heads of my departments. What's the riot about? Hello Mary. Anything new? It is going to be terrific! Weddings are my speciality. Wedding? What wedding? Mine. Darling, aren't you going to congratulate me? What for? It will never last. What won't last? My liver and a movie star's marriage. We know your liver won't last, darling. Gentlemen. I want you to go into an immediate conference. And develop me some idea of an outstanding wedding. It must be terrific. Yes, Mr Saxe. Wait a minute. One yes at a time. Miss Spiegel, get me my mum on the long distance phone. - Yes, sir. And if we don't gross a million dollars until the next picture. I'll buy for each one of you .. Never mind that. I will forget by that time anyway. Mary, my darling. Mary, throw the flowers to your fans. Hey listen, people. Was that marvellous? That's the most marvellous wedding we ever had. Wasn't that a fabulous wedding. We broke all the house records for this church. It was terrific. I wish my mama was here. How are we going to get out of here? Better break the bad news to them now, Saxy. Not here, Carey. Bad news? What bad news? - Well. You see, I really didn't want to tell you this until the very last moment. I've got to ask you to postpone your honeymoon. Postpone? Why? Well yesterday, we looked at Mary's last picture and the picture is terrific. It's great. A perfect picture. But we've got to make some little retakes. But couldn't they wait until I get back? - Darling. Release dates are not waiting on honeymoons. Well, you see you are already upset. It's only a week. Two weeks at the most. Now look here, Mary. Here is the bargain. You do this for me. And what am I going to do for you the next time? What are you going to do for them the next time? Never mind that. Oh, Lonnie. What are we going to do? I don't suppose there's anything we can do. That's the boy, Lonnie! That's the spirit. That's the spirit. I'm going to arrange everything now. You wait here. I'll find it. Oh, Lonnie. Lonnie. I think I am going to cry. Darling. Thanks folks. That was swell. Oh, the pressure is driving me crazy. How much longer are you going to be? We're ready now, darling. Come on. Quiet everybody. Quiet! This is a take. Make it a good one. Listen folks, get those cables off the table. Quiet. Quiet! Camera. [ French language singing ] Cut. How did that sound? We need to shoot it again. If you forget about your husband for a minute .. You might play this scene as if you meant it. You play it like they were a lot of landlords. Alright, Maxy. You show me. - Alright, I'll show you. Now when you start here with the man at the table .. You don't put enough in it. You want to give it more. Sort-of build it up. Gee baby, I'm sorry I kept you waiting all this time. What was the idea of saying you'd be through by 8 o'clock? Here it is, nearly midnight. Now baby, don't be grumpy. Now I'm going to be with you in a few minutes. Say, do you think I'm doing this because I like it? If you can forget your husband for a few minutes .. We might be able to finish this scene and go home. Well, it's too late to get to the theater now anyhow. Well, you stand a chance of seeing the last act. It might do her some good to see a competent actress. Say. Is it necessary to insult Miss Evans, Mr Carey? Outsiders are not allowed on the set. Why don't you let me direct Miss Evans, and you be Mr Evans? That will be all tonight, Max. Come on, Lonnie. You authors should be able to tell a story in fifty words. If you cannot tell it in fifty words, it isn't a good story. Who said it was a good story? You bought it, didn't you? The whole story of creation was written in 300 words in the Book Of Genesis. Genesis. There is the guy you should sign up. Miss Evans, how do you like the story? I don't think I should be killed in the fourth reel. Do you agree with me, baby? Absolutely, and furthermore .. - Now what does she know about pictures? Mr Saxe, do we have to do this story? What's wrong with it? Well, I have a baby. I don't think I should have a baby in every picture I do. Well Mary, this baby is different. You are getting married first. People, wait a minute! People! Wait a minute. I got an idea. - No. We'll throw the whole thing out of the window. Oh .. Baby, sit over here in the sun. It will do more good. Don't sit her in the sun. Her skin can't stand it. You don't know here like I do. In the sun she begins to look like an old piece of oilcloth. I like the Mythical Kingdom story. What do you think, Max? Well I refuse to direct either one of them. You refuse to direct? You should refuse to direct anything. Why don't you have somebody read these stories to you before you buy them? I can read. I can read! It's a great story. You produce one more Mythical Kingdom story and you'll be a mythical producer. Now you either throw that in the ashcan .. Or get some other boob to direct it. I don't know any other "boob". Lonnie. Where you going, Lonnie? - Just away for a break. You're not annoyed at anything, are you? - No, no. You are going to stay right here and wait until I think of an answer. I can't stay awake that long. You make me sick. - Mr Carey. My folks think that I got motion picture ability. I want to show you all something. - What? I can sing. Listen. [ Singing ] "All of me. Why not take all of me." What are you reading? - Family Post. It tells you how to do everything. What forks to use. How to speak to the Prince of Wales. I'm going to learn the whole thing by heart. You're pretty cute. Oh Lonnie, Lonnie. There is so many things I don't know. - What don't you know? Take this house for instance. I thought it was wonderful. And you don't. And .. I'm beginning to see things your way. Oh, don't be silly. Who is going to see it? No-one but Mr Carey and Mr Saxe and people from the studio. And they don't count, you think? Well, they are not exactly fastidious about such things. "How young girls .." They're my friends, Lonnie and you don't have to be so darned snooty about them. Well after all, dear, you can work with them. But must you make intimate friends of them? I don't have to. I do it because I like them. They are kind and human. And not so doggone superior. Darling. Oh, let's not quarrel about anything. Oh, Lonnie. I'll learn about everything. Honest I will. You won't be ashamed of me. My sweet. Oh, Miss Evans. The lady from the fan magazine is here. She wants that interview on your love life. Alright, Bonita. Tell her I'll be right out. - Alright, honey. But I thought we were going to play tennis with the Rhinehearts. Oh darling. I forgot. I'm awfully sorry but she's awfully important. I'll telephone and explain, huh? Will you forgive me? Yep. Here, you do this. No? I know. Gaudy, huh? Now it's new clothes. See, I'm learning. Now come on. She wants to see you too. Oh she doesn't want to see me. - Yes, please darling. I promised. I don't care what you promised .. - Please, baby. Absolutely, I am not .. I don't care what you promised. I am not going in. Please, baby. - Absolutely no. Poor darling. - No. No. How do you do. How do you do, Miss Dupont. My, what a lovely place. This is my husband. - How do you do, Mr Borden. How do you do. - I didn't dream you were so handsome. What a pair of lovers. I must have a photograph you looking at each other just like that. Well, let's sit down. - Thank you. Come on, Lonnie. Of course you know Miss Evans .. I'm writing a series of articles on the love lives of picture stars. And I want your love life for the April number. You want what? Now of course, you don't mind answering just a few intimate questions? Of course, I know you married for love. But was it the thoughtful reasoning, kind? Or was it the blind passionate .. "Oomph" kind of love? Well I don't know. I suppose it was. Well I should say it was the Oomph kind. That's good. Now, are you planning on having a family? I hope to someday. How sweet. How interesting. Have you separate bedrooms? No. So, I must have a photograph of your bedroom. Now Miss Evans, tell me. Just how far do you think a wife should go to keep a husband's love? Well. I know I'd go a long way myself. What do you think a husband should do to keep a wife's love, Mr Borden? I really haven't the faintest idea. Suppose you tell me. I've never been a husband. That reminds me. Have you a photograph showing your marvellous physique? No. No, but I have my appendix in the other room in a bottle. Perhaps you'd like to photograph that? Has he gone to get it. No. I don't think so. Miss Spiegel. "Yes, sir?" Have you heard any news from Carey yet? "No, sir." Did you call up all the hospitals? "Yes, sir." And the morgue? "Yes, sir." Well, he isn't dead, anyway. Mr Saxe, Mr Saxe. May I talk to you for a minute? Hello Mary. Come right in. Sure. Mr Saxe. The Hollywood Mirror says you've hired someone else to finish Carey's picture. Yes. And for once, the Hollywood Mirror is right. But that will break his heart. Uhuh. And if I don't it will break my heart. And my pocket book too. I should pay so the entire company for a whole week can do nothing? While Carey goes on a drunk. Where is he now? You are asking me where is he now? I've been asking the same question from the entire world for a whole week. Nobody knows where he is now. And besides that, I don't care. I'll find him. I'll bring him back. Mary, it won't do you no good. This time I fire him for good and I mean it. Oh, but Mr Saxe. If Carey ever needed your help, it's now. He's been a great director. And he can be again. But if you kick him out it will finish him. Yes? And if I don't it will finish me. Listen, Mary. My darling. I've let sentiment interfere with my good sense for too long a time. Besides, nobody knows where he is. And the picture has got to go on. I'll find him. Mary. If he's in jail. I'll bail him out. But I want him in his job. I am telling you and I mean it. The filthy rag. I don't know how they find out everything I do. That's their business. After all, you're in the Hollywood spotlight. You know everything you do and say is discussed and exaggerated in the papers. And in the magazine and around the studios. After all, you might think of me, of appearances. Appearances. Lonnie, don't you realize that Carey has been fired? I'll not have him roll around the gutters .. Where all his fair-weather friends can see him and laugh at him. Well, he brought it on himself. I don't care. I'm not going to let him down. He gave me my first break. You're letting me down? No privacy. No home life. Couldn't you leave your business affairs at the studio and not drag them home? Perhaps it'll be better if I stayed at the studio myself. Don't be nasty. Oh Lonnie, I'm not being nasty. I'm tired of arguing. Sometimes it seems that life is just one great big argument. I didn't mean to be nasty. You know what I've been thinking? - What? Let's take a trip East? [ Yodelling noises ] Whatever was that? Carey. [ Yodelling ] Hey listen. Pipe down old man. We want to go to sleep. That isn't the way to handle him, darling. Let a little sunshine in. I have something very important to tell you. Well, what is it? Nothing. Now go on home, old man. Don't call me an old man or I'll burn your house down. See? See that? Well, I think I'll do it anyway. Max, now stop it. Max, don't be foolish. Max, stop it will you! Max, stop it. Max. Will you behave yourself. - We want to go to sleep. Max. What? Will you let me in? Yes. Go around to the front door. At this hour of the morning. - It's the only way to handle him. Bonita! Bonita. Put Mr Carey to bed in the guest room. Yes, ma'am. Alright I will. Hello, Bonita. - Hello, Mr Carey. I'm alright. Now you come on. I'm alright. I'm going to get you to bed. Am I interrupting anything? I've done a lot of thinking and I can't think any longer. Where is your liquor? This isn't a nightclub. Will you be a good boy Max and go to bed. I'm not sleepy. Will you do me a favor and go home! Mary, do you mind both of you if I become serious for a moment? Max, go to bed. I've something of great interest to tell both of you. Well .. Maybe you'd be more comfortable if you came here into this bed? Now Lonnie, that's going too far. I don't blame him. He doesn't understand people like us. Mary, I must give you some good advice. - Max, will you please .. Wait a minute. Listen. You can listen too. Maybe it will do you a lot of good. Max, will you please get out of here. Lonnie doesn't think this is funny. Well, nothing is funny to that bird. Lonnie .. where are you going? I'm going as far away from Hollywood and all its inmates as I can get. Don't be absurd. - Let him go. He'll come back. I'm not coming back. I'm fed up with this kind of living. I should have known better from the start. What do you mean, you're not coming back? I mean we don't live in the same world. Right. In the world I live in the people are human beings. Not stuffed shirts! You live in a world where people are cheap and vulgar without knowing it. And if you weren't cheap and vulgar yourself you couldn't stand it. Alright, if that's the way you feel, get out! Get out. Get out! Get out! Quiet everybody. Quiet! Quiet! This is a take. Quiet! Camera. Alright, come on Miss Evans. Cut! Okay for sound? - Okay for sound. Is that alright for now? - That's swell, Mary. Sure you don't want me to do it again? - No, you've only got two more scenes. Hello Max. - Hello Bill. - Emily, give me my script. Oh, after this, I'm going to have my rain heated. Boiling hot, only they call it coffee. It is hot. Jimmy, give me the lines for that last scene will you. How are you, Jimmy? - Hello, Mr Carey. Good to see you. I'm just a visitor here tonight. - I wish you were making this picture. He's doing a much better job than I could do. Have some coffee. - Yeah, thanks very much. A beautiful sight, Carey. Always drunk. Mr Saxe. Let's give him another chance. Not a chance. Once a drunk, always a drunk. Alright for the next scene, Miss Evans. Miss Evans, we're ready when you are. Alright, Jimmy. I'll be there. What's the matter, darling? That's fine. He never appreciated you anyway. You'll be happy. Happy? Sure I'm happy. Why shouldn't I be happy? I'm going to have a baby in September. Darling. It will be a blessing. Mummy! Mummy. Mummy. Look. There is a baby. Ah, look at my boy. Come on to your Mummy. Come on, we'll go and look for Peter Rabbit. Come on .. come on. Oh, you're such a big boy. Has he been a good boy, Nana? Yes, ma'am. - Come on, now. We'll kiss Mr Saxe. There we are. Now you know what we're going to do? You've been a good boy and we're going to look for what the bunny left us. Yes, the bunny has left us a lot of surprises. Come on, let's go. Where do you suppose that bunny could have left them? Where do you suppose that bunny could have left something? Come on. We're going to look. We're going to look. You think it's under here? Let's look under here. Let's look under here. Is it there? No, I don't see anything there. Come on over on the other side. Anything there? No. Where do you suppose that bunny could have left everything? Where do you suppose? That's the boy. Isn't that pretty? Look at that. - Isn't he a great boy. Now you carry it. Mummy will help you. Come on. Very soon we are going to have a new screen lover, eh? Come on, I wonder where they can be. You think they're under that chair? No. Oh, look Jackie. Look under there. Look under there. Isn't that lovely. This just came for Jackie, Miss Evans. Oh, thank you. Look, what's this? What's that, Jackie? Is that a chicky? And a bunny with a pretty egg? And there is some nice grass and candy. Look, darling. Look Jackie, it's a lovely bunny that your daddy sent you. Isn't that sweet? Oh, he's a lovely bunny. Isn't that sweet. Alright Nana, you can take him to bed now. Take the bunny. Give your mummy a kiss goodnight. Come on darling. Give your mummy a kiss. A nice big kiss. Thank you. Give me a big kiss goodnight. That's lovely. - Come on. Goodnight darling. Mummy will bring the Teddy-bear. Goodnight, sweetheart. From his daddy. Oh, don't be silly. Say, Mary. What are you going to do about letting Lonnie have the baby part of the time? I'm not going to let him. It's the most unreasonable thing I've ever heard of. He divorced me before the baby was even here. I read in the papers that he is going to play Polo next month in Del Monte. Yes. I understand he's engaged to a girl up there. I bet you he will be tickled to death for you to have him back. Why don't you? Stop writing scenarios, Saxy. I beg your pardon, madam. There is a Mr Roberts on the telephone. He says he's an attorney and it is something to do with Mr Carey. Alright. I will be right there. Carey. How long has he been gone this time? About 3 months. Now listen, Mary. Don't let him have any more of your money. He has borrowed from everybody he ever knew. Hello? Yes. Yes. I thought it might interest you to know that he's in jail. Yeah. A client of mine cashed a rubber check. Well, I'll see what I can do about it. What kind of foolishness are you going to do now? Nothing I wouldn't do for you or for any other friend who was in trouble. Mary, you can't help anybody who has lost all his self-respect. Be careful. Already people have talked. When you got your divorce they said it was all okay. To you it was only loyalty. To them it was something else again. I'm telling you, you can't afford to get mixed up with Lonnie again. Joe. Bring Carey from tank 2. Here you are, Mr Roberts. Now, you are sure your client will withdraw the charges? Sure, Miss Evans. My client don't want to prosecute. All he wants is his money. Where is he? - He'll be right out, Miss. Come on, Carey. You're going out. Hello, Max. Anything new, Mary? Have you got a cigarette? Here are your things, Mr Carey. Is it all there? Sign this receipt, please. Right here. Come on, Max. We're going home. Can I do anything else, madam? No thank you, Martin. He'll go to sleep in a little while. Goodnight. Goodnight, ma'am. - Martin. Thank you for the nightie. Oh, that's nothing at all, sir. Goodnight. Now how do you feel, darling? I feel as though I ought to say thank you. You should have left me where I was. Oh Max, please. I'm not unhappy, the way I am. I didn't mind anything. I didn't even mind that jail. That's kinda funny too. Oh Max, how can you ..? You mustn't be unhappy over a man who doesn't exist anymore. I'm not the Max Carey that you once knew. I'm all burned out, Mary. Don't you see, I'd dead inside. I should feel ashamed. Degraded. But I just can't feel anything. You know what? You are going to stop drinking. You are going back to work. Work and I haven't been on speaking terms for quite some time. Everybody and every studio will be after you when you are well. I've stopped kidding myself, Mary. I'm washed up in pictures. Done for. I haven't got it anymore. It's all gone. I know. That isn't true, Max. You can get straightened out. You'll come back. From where I am, they don't come back. Max, I won't have you talking like that. Now that you are top of the heap. I'm happy. You know something. From tonight on .. you're going dry. Alright. From tonight on, I won't cause you any more trouble. That's the boy. Now, you must get a lot of sleep. A lot of rest. Goodnight, darling. Goodnight, Mary. Mary. Yes, darling? I just wanted to hear you speak again. Goodnight .. bless you. [ Gunshot! ] Max. Max! So how long do you think this story is going to hog the front page? Long enough to wash her up in pictures. Stick around. We'll get something out of this yet. You reporters get out! Miss Evans ain't seeing nobody. Is she home? I don't know where she is. Just get off the premises. That's all. Hey, tell her she'd get a better break in the papers if she plays ball with us. Oh, beat it. Charlie, I got a tip. See if we can make them answer the door. - They won't answer. I rang those bells for five hours yesterday. Hey, you waitress. Since when did you get so high hat? She's afraid to talk to a decent woman. America's Pal? Can't we get rid of these reporters? Tell them to leave me alone. Now Mary, calm down. Oh, it's easy enough for you to be calm. You haven't got people whispering about you. Printing lies about you. Turning against you. Why am I guilty? What have I done? I brought a poor sick man to my house. I know Mary and it breaks my heart too. But the public don't understand relations like this between you and Carey. Well, I'm glad I did it. I'd do it again. I was the only friend he had. - I know, Mary. I know. And if you were just an ordinary girl it would have been alright. But you are a motion picture star. You belong to the public. They make you and they break you. Well .. they won't break me without a fight! Mary. Mary. I'm going to tell them my side of the story. That's a great idea. We'll invite all the newspaper boys to my office. And you will give them a statement. Do you think it will do any good? - Sure, Mary. The public doesn't want to be unjust. Sure it will do good. And then in a few months everything will be forgotten. Yeah. In a few months Mary Evans will be forgotten. Nobody will ever take your place, Mary. You're being very sweet, Saxy. But you're not fooling me. Don't you understand? It isn't my career alone I'm thinking of. I've got a son, Saxy. I've got to clear my name for his sake. I've got to fight this thing. I've got to! A reporter sent this in, madam. I've got to get away from here. - What is it? I've got to take Jackie to Europe where no-one can find us. He couldn't take Jackie away from you. May he could with all this scandal. Who knows that he wants to take Jackie away? How does the reporter know? They know. I must get away. Look, Mary. Be sensible. If you run away now people will believe the worst. I don't care what people believe. I won't lose Jackie. I must get away! Miss Evans. This French cook don't even know her own language. I've been trying to tell her how to make a rice pudding with raisins in it. And all she does is bark at me like a dog: oof, oof! [ French language ] [ French language ] Bonita, all she wants to know is how many eggs to put in the pudding. "Oeufs" means "eggs". [ French language ] [ French language ] "Oeufs" means "eggs". This new French language sure is getting me down. [ French language ] Someone has taken Jackie. Is this where you live? Well if it is, we'll go in and see anyway. My baby. [ French language ] Goodbye, Jackie. Oh, Mary. Aren't you going to say hello? How did you find us? Detectives. I kidnapped Jackie because I realised .. I'd never be able to get in to see you any other way. Why have you come? Well among other things I've a rather important message for you from Mr Saxe. I'll read it. "Dear Mary. Just bought a new story. It will make a great comeback for you." "You go to prison for the man you love. Exhibitors are interested." "Mother and I send love." "Julius Saxe." There is a PS. "And you had better remarry Lonnie Borden." "He adores you." "He always has." "Of course, he realises that he isn't good enough for you .. but .." "He'll do anything if you'll only take him back." It's true. Honest, and a whole lot more. And you didn't go to Hollywood just to take Jackie from me? Well of course not, dear. I came out to help if you needed me. Oh, Lonnie. Let's have dinner together tonight, huh? There is a hotel here with a magnificent main dining room. A 30-piece orchestra. Orchids. Suppose I said no? Well, you know what happened the last t?me. Lonnie. * steve d *
