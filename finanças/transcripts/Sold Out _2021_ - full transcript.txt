(film projector whirring) (traffic rumbling) - [Lauren] He works all day, and then he wants to go out at night, too. - One night a month, I wanna play a gig. I can't just go to work and come home, I need something that fills me up. - And I guess your family doesn't fill you up? - I didn't say that. - You kind of did. - Lauren, what do you think of John's music? - Ah, it's fine. - Thanks. - I was supportive for years, but at some point, he needs to grow up and realize, that it's not going to happen. Everyone thinks they can sing. Everyone thinks they were made for something great, and you know what? It's bullshit, because somebody has to work in a cubicle. (drumbeat) (background people chattering) - Let's go, guys, we've got a lot of antsy people out there. - Not yet. - Five minutes, that's it. - I can't believe she's late. - She'll make it. - She always does. (bluesy rock music) - Anyone else industry? - Yeah. - Hey, I liked the piece you did on streaming last month. - Thanks, I just hope it helps the artists. - Probably not, but enjoy the show. Hey, I'll see you at the after party. - Okay. - Oh, hey, you made it. - Yeah, yeah, quite a buzz on these guys. - Yeah, you'll love them, promise. Come on. - Hey, did you get my messages? - Yeah, I can't talk now. - I've got a new project for you. - Find me after the show. - It's important! - Well? - We sold out. (all cheering) - What's the vibe out there? - Well, there are 1000 people on their feet another 100 hoping to get in. That director I told you about is here, you got A&R guys and radio weasels everywhere. Take your pick, boys, any company you want, big, small, independent, they all wanna sign Lincoln 8. (Kat laughing) Well, come on, boys, this is the fun part. (rock music from the stage) - [Bassist] You're amazing. - [Both] Uh! - This is all because of you. - Damn right it is. (both laughing) Oh, oh-oh! - I think I might barf. - Breathe. (drummer breathing deeply) Better? - We'll see. (Kat laughs) - They're waiting. - You made this happen. - We did it together.

Got some messages for you. You know, they have these things called cell phones. Get your messages on a bright, little screen. - You're much more interesting than a cell phone. - There is that. (Kat laughs softly) You expecting someone? - Unfortunately. - Go easy on her. - Kat. - Hey, Garrett. - This is Mercy Maines. - Oh, my gosh, it's so great to meet you. Garrett told me you're the best. - [Kat] Don't trust a word he says. - How do you wanna do this? You wanna start by listening to her demo or we could just- - You can take a seat.

I'd hate to put you out. Malone, I would like to buy this lovely lady a drink. - No need, Kat drinks on the house. - On the house? I've been coming here for years, I've never had a drink on the house. - Maybe you should stop coming. - You'd miss me. - No. (John sighing) - So why did that girl care what you think? - Who knows? - Are you in the music business or something? - Something. - Really? - Why, are you a musician? Please tell me you're not. - Construction worker. - Thank you. (laughing) - But I do sing on the job. - So I bet you're super handy, right? - Oh no. That question always gets me into trouble. - What do you mean? - When someone asks that, it means they either need me to hang their mini-blinds or unclog their toilet for free or for a meatloaf or something. - You've been paid in meatloaf? - Twice. (Kat laughing incredulously) - So if I'm staying in a motel that has a leaky faucet, that's not something you'd be interested in fixing? (John laughing) - Ah, I don't know about that. - Okay, no worries. I'm sure I can find someone who would love to fix it. - I'm sure you can. Maybe call the manager. - Yeah, sure. Challenge. (laughing) - Meh-meh, meh-meh, meh-meh! - What are- (dog barking) - Whoa! - Oh hi, Janis. - Hello. Over here? Watch out, Janis.

(mini-fridge door opening) Better get going. - Yeah. Do you play? - [Kat] No, a friend gave it to me. - Wow, nice friend. (John sniffing) They all smell different, don't they? What's this, mahogany? - You're a construction worker? - That's my day job, honey. (melodic guitar music) Sorry, I have to run, I've got a gig. - What? - You think I go to Dugan's for the food? I don't know who you are or what you do, but I've been playing empty bars for 10 years. So if there's any way you can help me out. Come to the gig. Okay then. Good luck with your faucet. Bye, Janis.

Do you have more than three songs? - No. - Why not? - Because I have a wife and kid and a mortgage payment. - I'm sorry, you have a wife? - We're going through a rough patch. - Like going to people's motel rooms? - Spare me the judgment, I have enough of my own. - Well, you're gonna have to write more songs. You can't cut an album or play a show, unless you have at least 10 songs. - (laughs) What the hell are you talking about? - Oh, I'm leaving town and you're coming with me. - What? (hammer banging) I don't even know who you are. - I'm an independent music scout. I've worked with hundreds of artists, most of them you've heard of. Hey, if you don't believe me, ask around.

I said five o'clock. - I'm not going. - Why not? - Because I have responsibilities, I can't just pick up and leave. - Bullshit, people do it all the time. - Not me. - You're right, not you. You hate your job and your marriage, but by God, you're gonna suffer through them to the very end. - Don't pretend like you know me. - Well, I've known a lot of people like you and guess what? It's not cool to go down with the ship, find your joy and I swear it spills over to the people you love. - Do you have kids? - [Kat] No. - Then you don't know what you're asking me to do. - You're right, I don't, but I do know that kids learn what they live. What are you teaching your daughter, John? You asked for help, this is what it looks like. - I'm sorry, I can't. (door opening) (door closing) - [Kat] Unbelievable. - Who is she? - (sighs) She's in the music business. - That again? - Yeah, that again. - Just go. - What? - I can't stand the tension in this house anymore. I'm not happy, you're not happy, let's stop pretending. (door opening) - Wait! - Will you bring me a present, when you come back? - Of course. - A unicorn? No, wait, a giant panda. - A panda bear, you want a panda bear? - No, a giant honey bear. - A honey bear? You're my honey bear. Yeah, I'll buy that, sure. - I might have really long hair, when you come back. - I don't think I'm gonna be gone that long. Give me a hug, give me a hug. Call if you need me. - I won't.

(phone ringing) (traffic rumbling quietly) - Hey, Pete. I'm not gonna make it in today. I need to take some time off for personal reasons. I don't know, maybe a week. - A week? - I know, I didn't expect to get paid. Yeah, yeah, I get it. (traffic rumbling quietly) God! I got fired. - They're hiring, you wanna get an application? - You think this is a joke? I have bills, I need a job. - You have a new job. Tell the truth. Speak it, write it, sing it. - Does it come with dental? (car rumbling) (melodic guitar music) It's no good, I don't even know how I wrote those three songs. Everything that comes out now is crap. - Write it anyway, then go back and fix it. - There's no hook, it can't be fixed. - John. (John sighing) You can't be an artist and a critic at the same time. When you write, you write. Give yourself that freedom. And when you're done, decide if it's any good. Try tuning it down half a step. (tuning the guitar) (melodic guitar music) - Hey, that sounds better. - I know. - Are you a musician? - Nope. - Singer? - No. - Then how did you get into the music business? - Bad luck. When are you most creative? When you're showering? Running? Doing dishes? - To be honest, I haven't felt creative in a while. - When was the last time? (gentle melodic music) - When Lauren and I were dating. I used to write in the space above the garage, it had great acoustics and I had this Hoffman guitar, that sung like a bird. Then she got pregnant and we needed money for a car with a backseat, so we sold everything, bought a Honda. - Solid car. - I liked my guitar better. - Let's find it. (cheerful melodic music) - Hey, Phil, it's John Callahan. Yeah, yeah, it's been a while, random question, do you still have that Hoffman I sold you a while back? Okay, what cousin? Yeah, yeah, I met her once. Um, where does she live? Hey great, thanks, Phil, appreciate it, man. It's in LaCrosse. (cheerful banjo music) Should I check to see if there's a leaky faucet? (bag unzipping) - Why? You wouldn't do anything about it anyway. I'm going for a run. (bag unzipping) (footsteps running) What are you doing? - I haven't exercised in ages, do you mind? - I do, actually. - So where are you from? (Kat groans) What, you're the only one, who's allowed to ask questions? - Chicago. - I checked the faucet, by the way, it's not leaking, but I would've fixed it. - I wouldn't want you to fix it anymore. - No? - No. - You sure? - Yeah, that moment has passed. (gentle guitar music) (John sighing) - I've got nothing, I'm just coming up blank. - Is there a voice or sound in your head? Something that drives you? - The words "I expected more from you." - Who said that? - My father said it first. My parents split up, when I was a kid, my sisters went with my mom, I went with Dad. He was a salesman, a lot of cheap suits and cologne. He was always gone, so I was left to fend for myself. I used to cook dinner outside, so I wouldn't have dishes. One night when I was eight, I took some ham out to the woods behind our house, cooked it over a fire. It never dawned on me, that it hadn't rained in months, just knew I was hungry and no one was coming to help. The fire took out 20 acres. When my dad picked me up at the police station, he said, "I expected more from you." The upside was in juvie, they gave me breakfast, lunch and dinner and I wasn't alone anymore, so it all worked out. - Except for that voice in your head.

It's an Indian drum, magical, the first time I heard it, I connected with a part of myself deep down inside, that is actually Indian, I never knew She was there, until I played the tabla. - Where's the guitar? - I sold it to a pawn shop in Cedar Rapids. - Shit. - How long ago? - I don't know, maybe a month. - Do you know the name of the store? - No, but I can take you there, I need rent money. Arlo, we're taking a drive! My boyfriend, you'll love him. - So then she came into my tent and asked if anyone had any extra birth control pills. - (laughing) Well, it was Burning Man, I figured there was every kind of drug there, right, why not birth control?

When you commit to something, it changes shape, it changes everything. - The last time I committed to something, it didn't turn out so well. - So, try again. - How long have you been playing music? - About 15 years. I don't really count the years I was an addict. - What got you through? - A higher power. You gotta believe in something bigger than yourself. - So you think you were put here to make music? - No, I think we're all just put here to make the world a better place, you know, no matter how you go about it, build a bridge, plant a tree, write a song. Doesn't matter, just leave the world a better place than you found it. - Thanks. - Goodnight. - Hey, why'd you give Kat a guitar, if she doesn't play? - Why don't you ask her?

I'm gonna drop him off at the train station and then run some errands in town. I won't be back till late, get writing. - [John] Yes, ma'am. - And you, stay away from the beer, okay? - Whiskey it is. (door opening) (car rumbling quietly) (melodic guitar music) (John humming tunefully) (door opening) (light clicking on) (eerie music) - Hey. - Jesus, you scared me. What are you doing up? - Doing a little reading actually. - Okay. - Yeah, I was just reading about a child prodigy. It's an incredible story, she wrote like hundreds of songs, played 14 instruments, even composed a symphony before the age of 12. She sounds amazing. Katie Revere, huh? - That's me. - I don't get it, you're this musical genius, why are you keeping it a secret? - Because it's none of your business. - Well, it kind of is my business, because I left my wife and daughter and job at your suggestion and now I'm not sure who you are. - I'm going to bed. - See, I've been sitting here for hours trying to figure out what the big deal is and for the life of me, I can't make sense of it. - It's nothing. - Then explain it. - The music business wasn't my cup of tea, so I got out. - Not that far out. What's ironic is that you told me my job was to tell the truth, to speak it, write it and sing it. But it's fine for you to lie, right? - Alright, I've had enough. - Tell me one thing. Do you miss it? (eerie music) - What? - [John] Singing, playing. - No. - And there's another lie. See, now I'm getting good at spotting them. - Get out. - What? Why are you- - Get the- - Why are you pushing me away? - Get the hell out. If you don't wanna be here, then leave, no one's stopping you. - Guess I touched a nerve. - Go on, go back to your pathetic life. Lie in bed next to a woman you don't love and pretend like it doesn't bother you to wear a tool belt for the rest of your goddamn life! (haunting orchestral music) (slow piano music) (footsteps running) (train rumbling) (slow piano music) (door slamming shut) - That went well. - If you'd like to come back, I'd be happy to talk to just you. - No, thanks. - You know, it's amazing what can happen, when just one person believes in you. But the truth is that person has to be you. (snow crunching underfoot) (door opening) (Lauren laughing) - Oh, God! John, what are you doing here? - Where's Millie? - John. - Where's my daughter? - She-she's at my mom's. John. Wait, don't do this. - You did this. It's funny, I had all this guilt about leaving, but it worked out pretty well for you, didn't it? - That is not fair. You left here with another woman. - We're working together. - Are you really telling me you don't have feelings for her? (John sighing) (gentle melodic music) We're not happy anymore and we both deserve to be. If someone had to be the bad guy, I guess it was me. (door opening) (door closing) - I'm gonna miss you, girl. - You sure you wanna leave her? - Give you a reason to get up every morning. - Where to now? What's this? - It's enough to pay what you owe on the house. (Wayne sobbing quietly) Not for beer, for the house. - Yeah. Yeah. (bag zipping up) - Hey. Don't you miss having a place to call home? - Every day. (melodic orchestral music) (melodic guitar music) - I wish you could come over today. - We talked about this, kiddo. - But Mom won't mind, please, just to open presents? - I'm sorry, honey. (knocking on door) (door opening) - [Millie] Mommy! - (laughs) Hi, sweetie. I missed you. Hey, go get your stuff, the car's running. Hi. - Hi. - Merry Christmas. - I didn't get you- - It's okay. (laughs) I just saw it and thought you might like it, open it. (paper rustling) I know you said he's a friend of yours, you may already have it. - I don't. Thank you. - Listen, um, if you don't have anything to do tomorrow, you're welcome to come to the house. I mean, Frank will be there, but I know it would mean the world to Millie. - I'm good, thanks. Come here, you. (Lauren laughing) Hey. Have a good Christmas, okay? - Good girl. (door opening) (door closing) - I can't believe you're open on Christmas. - What else am I gonna do, roast chestnuts? May as well feed the lonely. - You're a smart man. - Not according to my wife. (John laughing softly) Beer? - [John] Yes, sir. (bottle of beer opening) - Five dollars. - On Christmas? Have a heart. - Oh, I have a heart, it needs medication and that shit's expensive. - [Kat] Why don't you put it on my tab? (background Christmas music) - Hi. - Hi. - I'm surprised to see you here. - Yeah, well, I'm Malone's Secret Santa, so I had to stop by. (paper rustling) Ah, my favorite. Careful now or I'll mistake you for someone who cares. - Many do. - Messages. - Most of those are from me. (bottle of beer opening) - On the house. (background Christmas music) - I tried to call you, but your dad said you'd already left. - Yeah, well, you know me. - No, I don't. - How you been? - I can't say I ever spent Christmas in a bar. - (laughs) Welcome to the club. (bottles clinking) So divorce, huh? - How'd you know? - I stopped by your house and the RV king told me. - The RV king and the prom queen, they're a match made in heaven. So why'd you come looking for me? - Who said I was looking for you? - It's kind of obvious. - Okay, so what if I was? - You tell me. - I don't like how things ended. - So I got under your skin? - Don't push it. - The road's gotta be lonely. - I like the road. - I never said you didn't. I don't care why you're here, I'm just glad you are. You wanna get out of this shithole? - [Malone] I heard that.

That's a beautiful song. - I wrote it for you, in case you leave today, at least you heard it. Was it easy for you to write? - Pretty much. I always had a melody in my head, it wouldn't stop, until I got it out. - What was your instrument? - Piano. - But you play guitar too? - I do. I did. What else do you wanna know? - Why do you cry in your sleep? - I... I begged my mom to send the demo to record companies. She was against it at first, but then she saw it was what I wanted, what I needed and she got involved. It's funny, she chose the label, sat in on every recording session, met with every producer, shook the hand of every radio DJ, but she never wondered why the head of the label needed to see me at his house on weekends. (gentle melodic music) The first time, I was 14. I tried to run. I screamed, "I won't, I won't, I won't let you touch me!" And he said, "Of course not, honey. You touch me." So that's, that's what we did. - Jesus, Kat. Did you tell anybody? - I told my mom and it killed her. She was dead a year later. Pop picked up the bottle and never stopped. So I love music just about as much as I hate it. - I'm so sorry. - I don't need pity, okay? - [John] Okay. - So let me ask you something. (John laughing) Do you have 10 songs? - I do. - Good! (both laughing) - In fact, I have 10 songs, plus 18 more. - Really? - Really. - Well then, it's time for you to have a show. (both laughing) - No, every Friday's filled for the next three months. - Then bump someone. - He brings in eight people. - 12. - Not anymore, we'll sell out. - (groaning) Fine. (Kat laughing) - Alright, you're gonna need a band. - I am? - You are. (cheerful, upbeat music) - Once more. (band chattering) - Hunter, it's Kat Revere. I wanted to invite you to a gig on the 27th.
