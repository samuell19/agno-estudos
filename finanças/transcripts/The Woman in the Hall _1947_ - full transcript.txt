No thank you I'm afraid I haven't many vices Oh heavens I think I have such a lot Well,as I was saying my marriage turned out very unhappily Soon after my baby girl was born My husband deserted me and for 18 years he left me to bring up my child without contributing a penny -And you didn't divorce him? -That was my mistake If only I'd realized what Neil had in store for me Do you mean your husband came back to you? Yes he came back but only to take my child away from me And eventually he succeeded And now they both gone I don't know where But how dreadful He said he could do what he liked with his own child He said it was the law I know well enough of the law if they'd found out what he'd done they'd taken her away from him and never let him see her again Then why don't you see that they do find out -Seems a very good idea -That's what I thought But I must have evidence if only I had the means to employ a private detective I could at least find out where they are I don't keep much money in the house but if this would help for the moment Dennison I didn't come here to ask for money But only for your advice But since you're so very very kind Oh, Mrs Inglefield I'd rather like to keep in touch with you Oh yes indeed might I leave my address?

I'll tell you she is coming back tomorrow I'd put a call through to Mrs Carbury Don't make a scene with them it won't do you any good or Jay I want trunk inquiries please Don't you see mummy it isn't good for Jay to be here She's not an ordinary person and she'll get worse and worse more more dependent on you She'll never grow up into a normal woman You're bad for her You little fool,what do you know about good and bad and what do you really know about Jay If you think you can come between us you're mistaken I tell her she needs me and I'm going to get her back even if -Trunk inquiries -Trunk inquiries I want you to find If you'll bring her back here I shall go straight to the police How dare you interfere like this You think you'd be very clever,don't you? But I'll show you I can get Jay back again anytime I like simply raising my little finger All right let her stay If anything happens to her,remember Molly darling I'm so dreadfully sorry I love you darling never think that I don't -We must go we'll be late -What's the hurry Come along Look -How much are they? -Six pence each,Miss Here's one for you and you and one for you Come along you meanies pay them You are expected when you're married -When? -No defeated them,please Only three bob from you Mary, you pay two last week -So I did -Ready?

Good Hello, come and sit down No,Toby,you sit,please do Thank you Now,Miss Blake,what can I do for you Your father says I'm to work for you Does he? Good that suits me It's not right you should have chosen one of the senior girls As a matter of fact I wasn't asked -But if I had been -Oh Toby I don't want to get on through charity I want to make my own way in the world You're doing so Jay,why didn't you stay on at my aunt's house? Weren't you happy living with Daffy and Chloe? No So you prefer a dreary bunch at the boarding house,do you? I don't think they're dreary I find them rather brave They don't get much fun out of life I see,you're the girl with the mission You bring happiness to others is that the idea? Yes You know I bet you have made them happier since you went there Perhaps I have I don't know -Besides -Besides what? At your aunt's house they all gave the whole time -But I have nothing to give back -You are a funny girl Shouldn't the have's gift to the haven't? Of course but what I'd like is to be one of the givers You think that's strange Perhaps even conceited -But it's how I am -I like you as you are Please don't ever change for you What's the matter? Nothing My dear Alfred,don't say I find you in the state of dubiety This letter,Sir Halmar I think perhaps you ought to see it It's a begging letter but it's got a sort of emanation No,how much does this emanation require and for what purposes The specific amount is left to us Looks like a woman,Dear Sir Halmar Barnard If I cannot get some help by Friday next you will read in the papers of just another common place tragedy forced on a lonely and desperate woman It is a woman But tell me,Alfred, is this letter genuine or not Oh,not -Hmm -Not ungenuine,I mean Tell me the gist Well, it's very nearly all gist This Mrs Blake met a woman in the hall of the South Kensington Museum Tapestry Department She ordered a set of embroidered petit point coverings for chairs from her to be sent be sent to an address in Carlisle Who ordered from whom? She did,the woman -from her -she did the woman,go on She trusted her bought the materials at considerable outlay -which she could ill afford -did the work send it to Carlisle Never heard another word and is now on her beam-ends A child in arms could have detected the swindle Of course yes,yes I'll write a polite refusal You'll do nothing of the sort but you really must acquire some humankind in this,Alfred Give me my cheque-book -How much do you think? -She's got to go to Carlisle Ten pounds might cover it Ten pounds? No,you're not going about this the right way at all,Alfred No,Sir Halmar We can't give this woman money she'd be mortified what she needs is practical help -How about a private det.. -Private detective from the tip of my tongue,that's it Because they generally want a large cash deposit Money again why will you keep sounding such a sordid note My old friend Bob Henshaw Chief Constable of Belcaster right in the area And that is what I was going to suggest it'll cost nothing It isn't the cost,Alfred Now we better tell this poor woman what we propose first Draft my reply to her I'd say this is rather nicely expressed You'll with that rare gifted imagination like a stained-glass window through which the rich light falls I can just picture her A poor little sniveling whisper of a creature with rusty black with pricked fingers and then as she reads our message of hope Well,you've done it this time If this (?)writes to that chief constable you are in the soup -What did you sign it? - Blake Well,when do we move -We don't move -What then? I'm going down to see him,of course -She's in the hall -Who?-That Mrs Blake -Who in heaven's name -Tapester's room -Tapester -Carlisle,petit point -What? -She isn't quite what we'd imagined Impressions? I don't care what she's like Alfred will you please tell her Sir Halmar,please You do understand,don't you? I simply had to come I couldn't rest until I put things right Sir Halmar,I never wrote that letter It's dreadful to think of, a begging letter A letter as good as asking for money Such a journey it's all that woman she's done it before and she'll do it again unless I Why is life so difficult I must explain this dreadful,dreadful mistake Please,may I? Alfred, I shan't want the car yet Very good,Sir Halmar Sit down there Now,Mrs Blake First of all may I see the letter you received? The letter? Yes,yes of course -Excuse me,Alfred -Yes,Sir Halmar Bring the letter Mrs Blake wrote -I mean didn't write -Yes,Sir Halmar Send in some sherry and biscuits The same lies the same brazen request for money at the end And even imitating my handwriting But anyway that can do no more harm The woman who wrote this letter,this governess Miss Gardiner Poor Gardiner She's committed forgery you should hand over her to the police I couldn't do that my little girl, she's devoted to Gardiner -A little girl -My Molly Yes,of course How stupid of me you wouldn't need a governess You've just one child? Just the one Excuse me Alfred,I shan't want the car until this afternoon and Mrs Blake will be staying to lunch You see the awful thing is well we are are the hard up and Gardiner really thinks she's helping us I want you to promise me to send this Miss Gardiner away Right away out of your life to South America for instance Sir Halmar apart from my feelings the fare -Fare? Well,I'll pay the fare -Sir Halmar Forgive my crudeness Mrs Blake won't you let me do just that for you? Please Excuse me Alfred I shan't want the car at all today except to take Mrs Blake to the station later Very good,Sir Halmar Anything for Blake Inglefield -Got a cold -No,why? Police they followed me all the way from the shop Look I knew it around(?)mark(?) last Pull yourself together Susan answer the door and bring him to me Mrs Inglefield -Mrs Blake then? -Out -I'll wait -It will be a long wait I've got plenty of time Can I do anything for you? -I called to see see Mrs Blake -I'm afraid she's out So I understand I proposed to wait,do you mind? -May I see your authority? -I don't follow I suppose I can hardly argue with a policeman What? -You are detective aren't you ? -Are you expecting one? Oh no I just thought you looked Thank you,no,I'm not a policeman I didn't mean to be rude I'm so sorry,mother's out Mother Do you mind telling me who you are? -My name is Neil Inglefield -Neil Inglefield? Oh do come and sit down Here,this is the most comfortable chair Can't I get you some tea? Or would you like a drink? Let me get you another cushion Not decrepit and all that -So you are the daughter are you? -One of them -Surely you haven't forgotten Jay? -Jay? I'm Molly -And is this Jay like you? -Not a bit She doesn't look like mother either I think I think she's got your mouth Let's get this straight Jay's got my mouth,good lord, are you suggesting I'm your father? -But you said you were Neil Inglefield -So I am? Oh I see so Lorna has been handing out that sort of stuff to you too Then Molly Why do you come here what you'd have to do with us? I think you ought to know the truth My father married your grandmother as his second wife Your mother came to live with us she was only about 17 at the time She fell for my older brother Marcus And tried to break up his engagement -Did she marry him? -No she didn't Why are you telling me all this you've no right to come here No right, my dear girl your mother's been going around for years saying she's Mrs Neil Inglefield,my wife out of a sort of revenge or something spreading a pack of fantastic lies about a heartless husband who walked out and left her to starve Molly listen don't cry I'm sorry you've had to hear the truth like this I know what a life you must have had You must see I didn't come here to hurt you Goodbye Molly Aren't you going to wait for my mother? No,not now and don't tell her I came Not yet All right Couldn't we see each other again sometime? Not here I mean somewhere else or would you rather not? I'd like to Fine,goodbye -Can I come in? -Of course -Drink? -Yes,please I need one Don't say Lorna put it across you In a way,yes You found her then? I found where she lives She's got a daughter Who inherits her mother's gift for narrative I presume No that's just it Did I ever hear you say that once you found her Nothing could save her and you're just bought I can't prosecute Lorna because I can't do a thing to hurt this girl And Lorna gets off on that I'm afraid she does Do you propose to see this girl again? Not in her mother's house You are not suggesting that I should play fairy godmother by any chance? That's a very good idea,yes Look what I've got Oh isn't the spitting image of our Jock Are we Jock, this is a Pekingese You won't be allowed to keep him,dear Oh,yes I will Dear Jay asked Mrs Bryan about it before she gave him to me -Did Miss gave it -Shh Isn't she lovely and I've always so longed for a doggy of my own Such a handsome present He is rather pet My dear child thank you, thank you,thank you I wanted you to have him -I really must go I should be late -I understand,hurry dear -Jay -Eh Here,catch -Oh,Toby it's sweet but -What's the matter -Don't you like it -Yes of course but I Sorry Never could choose the right thing I looked at the cigarette case but well this was something you could wear I wish I could It's not that I don't like it It's just that I simply can't take anything -Sometimes you're ridiculous -I'm not ridiculous I'm a girl in your father's employment Don't be so old fashioned All right Jay,don't take it if you don't want to One day perhaps Oh Toby you are sweet Your future mother-in-law When do you propose to reveal our existence to her? I don't know Ironical isn't it? Instead of shutting her up I've got to ask her blessing Hello darling Excuse me,Sir,your table is ready Oh,good heaven how I nearly really forgot Don't look at it now my dear it's just your honest Gardiner's pass to a new life Absurdly generous I made it enough for Australia while I was about it Poor Gardiner No you're a sentimental creature I've been asking you for months to get rid of that woman she's bad for your little girl Could I have just a little more drink You see a child is much more impressionable when one thinks Yes Halmar but you do realize, don't you,that Molly is 20 next birthday 20? Your little girl You can hardly expect me to believe that Why not? That absurd little bag you carry you have a mirror I suppose Halmar,BTW Halmar,if you meet Molly,don't say anything about Gardiner She's so fond of her and she doesn't know Lorna, would I do anything to upset you or yours -Everything all right,Sir Halmar -Oh yes excellent,thank you And now I have a little confession to make Molly's an actress at home actress do you mind very much? What I love about you is your simple innocence Lorna You've make me the happiest man on earth If you'd do me the honor of becoming my wife Halmar Halmar,what a surprise here is Molly Darling what a lovely surprise We were just talking about you This is Sir Halmar Barnard he's been looking forward so much to meeting you How do you do Neil of all people but I've been asked the name of one person I've been dying to see after all these years I do believe you've forgotten who I am Oh,no I haven't Lorna Oh,my dear, I want you to meet Neil Inglefield Neil,this is Sir Halmar Barnard Now,Halmar why don't you and Molly get to know each other a little better take her away and dance with her while Neil and I have a talk about old times Shall we sit down Cigarette? Thanks BTW it suddenly occurred to me where did you meet my daughter And how long have you known her? Are you in love with her? I know what you're thinking of me Why doesn't he stop at his dreary old house out in the country Do you live in an old house in the country? But a useful riding country too, you should come down and sample it Very kind of you I must confess I don't ride We'll soon put that to rest I must confess,I expect to provide you with a little white pony A little white pony? Have you known my mother long? Long enough to know that she's the most adorable attractive woman So we're planning to become a great film star,are we? One can't plan to be a great star it's isn't that It is just we want to stand on our own feet -We? -Jay and I Yes,that's very creditable,who is Jay Halmar,you mustn't monopolize Molly now there are new two young things run off and enjoy yourselves and don't bother about our sole fogy -Thank you for our dance -Not at all,I won't forget it No pony full-sized hunter Well,nearly full sized No doubt we should be seeing each other again,Neil I am sure we shall Come along,Molly I think my new daughter no I mean Your daughter and I are going to get on famously Yes,Halmar, you were sweet Shall we go now?

I'm so sorry and I'm so bad about faces You know, I never forget them or names How lucky you are My memory is simply appalling,do forgive me -Then this time -Who? The police They want your mother I'm afraid my mother isn't down yet Better ask her to come down,Miss Mother,you must come down you're wanted This is your precious Neil's doing -Yes,Officer -Can I have a word with you,Madam Yes I'm going in there Don't fuss,dear,she'll be all right We'll get it through somehow Shall I go in?

Bail is allowed in one surety of a hundred pounds Jasmine Blake,you are committed to stand your trial at the next assizes is to be held at Salisbury on a date to be fixed Of course I don't wish to blow my own trumpet but I have had considerable experience and organizing this type of thing If we have some nice stalls with nice things and some original sideshows with some nice original things to do such as well you know the sort of thing I mean there's so much one can do in an English garden on a summer's day if only the weather is nice -Lady Cloy your car is here - Yes, I really must be going Now I think all that remains for me to do is to propose a vote of thanks to our Chairman Lady Barnard for her kindness in putting her house at our disposal and for a really magnificent tea and I'm sure the fete will be a great success I second that Thank you ladies I think you've all been wonderful in fact we've covered so much ground that there's hardly anything left for me to do at all I hope the meeting went well Most successful,Lady Barnard is a wonderful acquisition She has a perfect genius for raising money Goodbye -Get this room cleared up at once -Yes,My Lady -Tired? -A little Better go upstairs and rest a little,you owned it We're dining at home tonight,aren't we? -Well -Yes,Halmar,at home and alone Draw the curtains -Oh dear,part of your flock -No,no another triumph -What have you got on? -Don't you like it -It's hardly new -No,it's the new maid Give me another cigarette What is the matter with you? Nothing You know you started all wrong in this place Nothing but there's faith hope and charity stuff ever since we got you down here Nobody got me here I got myself and that doesn't make it any better What a sight Not heard from Molly I suppose How did that Miss Dennison turning up trumps and giving the girls a roof? Why not own up to Sir Halmar about Jay,go on your knees and cry a bit You know how For heaven's sake we've got to wait and see how the trial goes,haven't we? There you go putting it off again if you asked me you'll never get the kids back now Won't I?

She isn't my problem,my problem is when are we going to get married I can't abandon Jay You'd rather abandon me -Lady Barnard,Mam, -Lady Barnard? How nice to see you again Miss Dennison, do forgive me for dropping in so late Yes,you're late by a few weeks Possibly too late,Lady Barnard Molly darling Jay my own darling,baby,how I wish I could take you home with me and nurse you you've always said there's no one like mummy when you're ill I'm not ill, you weren't there She thinks I've deserted her she doesn't realize that you were a free agent Miss Dennison you were able to go to the rescue at Southampton You weren't there If you'd cared you would have come There's a lot in there to know You seem to succeeded in pretty well in alienating my daughter's affections Please don't be melodramatic If anyone's alienated your daughter's affections you have Neil thank heavens you're here She's cruel she said things to break my heart she said I'd lost my babies love Quite frankly I hope you have my dear Lorna What ever have you done for your baby? And for the other baby if it comes to that Year after year you've made their life a misery You turn their whole childhood into a nightmare You never once stopped to think what the permanent effect might be,did you? Well,there's the result and you talk about broken heart Well,why don't you say something man I'd have kept it from you,Sir but I thought you ought to see it You wanted me,Halmar Yes my dear Sit down My darling before I say another word remember I love you Thank you Halmar If I appear stern and angry it's because of the unspeakable reptile who wrote this letter -Anonymous,how degrading -Read it Dear sir Look,you ought to know this, your wife that you think is so grand has a daughter going to prison embezzling a thief is what decent people call it Told you she had one daughter didn't she? -Head for a mug from the start you were -That'll do Now darling Local postmark I don't see how anyone here could have known about Jay Jay Lorna Yes,Halmar,it's quite true I have got two daughters Jay was arrested for forgery just after we met I was afraid to tell you I thought I might lose you Lorna are you standing there telling me that this dirty libel is true Yes, quite true I'm sorry it was my fault she was so young -when she left home -Never mind about that We're not discussing how she came to be a thief But the fact that this is the first I've heard of her very existence I know,I've deceived you You mean you have made a mug of me No,Halmar,what was I to do? A woman with two daughters to support Woman,what sort of woman do you think you are What kind of a mother You've deceived me from the start you've lied to me every minute since we met You're no wife you are no mother You're a cheat, go away I never want to see you again Get out I say Well it's goodbye Susan since you won't come with me Alfred silly enough to want to marry me anyway it's time I settle down I hope you'll be very happy And Susan if you're not happy with Alfred just write him an anonymous letter I'm very sorry,Sir That's all right Susan You knew about Lady Barnard's younger daughter all the time I suppose Yes,Sir -When does this case come on? -Thursday,Salisbury Thank you,Susan You are Jay,aren't you? Is my mother here,Lady Barnard? Your mother's left here I don't know where she's gone What I got to do Where shall I go? I think you'd better come inside So you see Jay Nobody who's any good never runs away Think of your kind friend Miss Dennison who gave you a home pledge her word that should be at the trial and backed with 100 pounds whole hundred pounds unless you go back and give yourself up she'll lose all that money I'm frightened You're a brave girl,aren't you? -You're feeling better now? -Yes thank you Susan We'll take care of you,won't we,Sir? Naturally Yes,yes,of course,Susan Well,made up your mind? -What are you going to do? -Go back to Miss Dennison I think And then? Go to Salisbury and give myself up That's what I wanted to hear But only,could you please lend me my fare? You don't have to worry anymore about those things I'm going to have a nice long chat with your sister Molly I want to get to the bottom of all this Alfred get me Miss Dennison on the line,will you You heard what the prosecution witnesses have had to say and I think there can be no doubt in your mind as to the seriousness of the charges you've been called upon to answer now I propose to put to you immediately a very frank but simple question and I want you to think very carefully before you answer Don't forget I'm here to help you I'm your counsel, counsel for the defense and you've nothing at all to be frightened of Well I'm not at all frightened of you in fact I'm not frightened of anything or anybody in this court anymore Well I'm glad to hear it but it might be as well perhaps if you treated your present situation with a little less equanimity The accused is very young Mr Carlton We mustn't rely too much in case like this of matters of form and their procedure a little humanity,huh Your tolerance is much appreciated, My Lord Miss Blake,you were trying to bring happiness into the lives of your fellow creatures and it was your intention simply to borrow the money and Oh,no it wouldn't Wait for my question,please Everyone knows I took the money Why do we have to waste time going over all this again If we are wasting time,Miss Blake it is because we're concerned with your interests Mr Carlton, am I to understand that the accused wishes to change her plea to guilty Well,My Lord,with respect Please may I help Mr Carlton,what is the meaning of this interruption My Lord, some indulgences call for this is the girl's mother Lady Barnard if your Lordship will allow me My Lord,Lady Barnard thinks that if she were permitted to question her daughter Your Lordship and the jury would be assisted by a responsiveness from the prisoner which I must confess I find difficulty in eliciting But I'm sure your lordship would feel as I do The proposal,so contrary to all Contrary or not contrary Mr Carlton but I want to get at in this case as in every other case of the same kind is why seemingly decent well brought up children do wicked and criminal things -You don't object Mr Benson? -No,My Lord Lady Barnard, you may ask your daughter what you want -Your Lordship is too good -Thank you,My Lord I know I can help you If you don't I'm afraid I shall have to stop you Stand over there where I can see you both Jay,darling,supposing we were at home you and I and I'd come up to say good night to you and you were worried about something and wanted to tell me Oh,yes mother that's just it I do want to tell you We all know what you did but not why you did it Exactly You knew,didn't you, there was such a thing as honesty and when doesn't steal money Yes,I knew it was dishonest but I thought it made a difference if it was for other people Do you still think that Jay? No,I'm ashamed now Darling, a lot of people would say that was because you'd been found out and were afraid of being punished But mother I'm not afraid of being punished ,honestly It's all right darling Honestly is a good word if you mean it Honestly,I didn't choose one penny of it on myself and it was so lovely to see the children when I gave them presents and then the girls in the office and poor old Miss Mounce who did so want something to love and if I hadn't taken, I mean stolen the money none of the people I gave things to would have had them they still wouldn't have them Don't you see it,little goose if it were as easy as that to put the whole world right Do you suppose the whole world would have waited for Jasmine Blake to come and do it No,I see that now,Toby said I was ridiculous always to want to give I was worse,I feel wicked Darling,excuses don't rarely excuse anything But sometimes they do help to explain Have you any excuse for what you've done? I did get so tired of always having to say thank you You know don't you dear? But I am ready to blame for your being here Oh no why you? She's never going to tell the truth Do you remember how we were left alone you and Molly and I when you were a baby? We had very little money and nobody turn to for help We didn't mind being poor -We were happy then weren't we? -Yes And then you got ill It was difficult on my small income to give you all the special little things that you needed to help pull you through still We would have managed And then that dreadful old Baroness woman started to interfere don't you remember? Yes I think I remember Molly telling me And when I stood up to her she told all her useless friends what a bad mother I was And then they started to take us up as they put it In the end it got so bad that we tried to escape them by moving house several times we moved always found out where we were Lorna,how dare you these outrageous lies this ingratitude These people were your benefactors you taught Jay to be a wrongdoer For heavens name what is this new interruption Come forward,Sir How are you,Sir? Sir Halmar Barnard,My Lord -Lady Barnard's husband? - Yes My Lord The prisoner's stepfather I see and what have you got to say to explain this behavior? Only this My Lord but this trial has been shamefully treated and that if as a result of further evidence the court decides to exercise clemency I wish to take her into my own home and be responsible for her My Lord,I have something further to say Anything further you have to say will be from the witness box On oath One moment,where are you going? To the witness box,My Lord Do you wish to call this witness? Yes,My Lord The accused can stand down and return to the dock Goodbye darling You'll be alright now Goodbye,mummy Lady Barnard I must tell you that you are not bound to say anything that might incriminate you Do you understand? I understand My Lord Take the Bible in your right hand and swear the Oath I swear by Almighty God that the evidence I shall give before this Court will be the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth Subtitles by Nostromo
