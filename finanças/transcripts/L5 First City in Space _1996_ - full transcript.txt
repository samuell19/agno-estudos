YOUNG GIRL: Torch? Torch, where are you? Are you hiding on me? Torch? CHIEKO: Near the end of the 21st century, my mother and father and scores of others left the Earth for a new home. GIRL: Torch! CHIEKO: Several years later, I was born here in L5, the first city in space. [SQUAWKING] The garden was always my favorite place. You're a pretty bird. People said it reminded them of Earth. Of course, I had never actually been there, but I could imagine how beautiful it must be. Want to make a wish, Torch? It's lovely here too, living among the stars. Our city is the gateway to the solar system. It's home to 10,000 people. They came here to follow their dreams of exploration and expansion to new worlds. It takes about five days to get here from Earth on the transfer shuttle. It's routine now, but it wasn't always so easy. COMPUTERIZED VOICE: Transport data recall. CHIEKO: The journey began over a century ago when our ancestors took the first small steps away from their home planet. They faced an enormous challenge then: how to escape the gravity that held them pinned to the ground. They had to design a ship powerful enough to lift them into space and then return them safely through the searing heat of the atmosphere back down to Earth. There was no fusion power in those days. The early technology used more than two million pounds of fuel to launch a small crew and a few days' supplies into orbit. ASTRONAUT: Hey, Houston, I wish you could see the view we see on monitor two. CHIEKO: For the first time in their history, Earth dwellers saw their home from the outside. ASTRONAUT: It's an incredible sight, isn't it? CHIEKO: Perhaps it was then, as they gazed upon its fragile beauty, they began to see that instead of competing with one another, they could unite and explore the wonders of the solar system together. The first wonder they discovered was zero gravity. Suddenly, people were thrust into a world with no up or down. They had to learn a completely new way of living and working inside their spaceships. [COSMONAUTS SPEAKING RUSSIAN] Then the Russians built a space station called Mir. [COSMONAUTS SPEAKING RUSSIAN] Some early cosmonauts stayed inside this tiny outpost for over 400 days. The actual living space was only 30 feet long. Imagine spending a year in such a small place. [COSMONAUTS SPEAKING RUSSIAN] As the millennium began, the first cautious steps away from Earth turned into strides. Several different countries working together designed a much larger space station. The parts were made on Earth, ferried up on spacecraft, and assembled in orbit. It took seven years to build. The people that lived here were the first to really adapt to a continuous life in space. It wasn't long before they were ready to travel to another planet. [ELECTRICAL CRACKLING AND MECHANICAL WHIRRING] Finally, we reached the outer planets. [CRACKLING AND WHIRRING CONTINUE] We always sent robot scouts into new territory first. They were the builders and caretakers of our outposts. It was the great dream that people would soon follow and settle the outer solar system. To do that, we would need a port in space. It would have to be a place with very little pull from gravity so that ships could come and go with ease. And so it was that L5, a point on the moon's orbit around the Earth, was chosen. Then a master plan was drawn up, a grand design for the first city in space. Of course, people were used to Earth's gravity. To provide something similar, the living area on L5 would be built in a mile-wide wing which rotates once every minute. The centrifugal force from the spin would produce artificial gravity. The whole city would be connected by a continuous main street running around the outside rim. The farms and animals would be housed in different layers around the inner ring. Life would depend upon a continuously recycled supply of air and water. The spinning outer rings would be connected by four giant spokes to a stationary zero-gravity hub in the center. This was the entrance to our port where spacecraft dock. The entire perimeter of the structure would be encased in 10 million tons of moon rock to protect us from cosmic radiation. A giant mirror would float nearby to bathe the city in reflected light. At last, after nearly 30 years, our city was complete. With each transport from Earth, new citizens arrived. We captured an asteroid to mine its metals and fuels for our growing fleet of ships. Our dream of settling the outer planets was soon to be realized. [CHILDREN SQUEALING IN DELIGHT] Inside the city's protective skin, the population flourished and grew. By the time I was seven, there were 10,000 of us here. We modeled our neighborhood after small towns on Earth. [KIDS LAUGHING] There were sensors everywhere which could detect any sign of contamination or imbalance in the air supply. Most days, my mother would come by the playground on her way home from work. She was a doctor and had been one of the first people selected to come here. Eric. See you soon. How's your hand? CHIEKO: She seemed to be friends with just about everybody. Can you...? Good stuff! CHIEKO: Her father-- my grandfather-- was a pioneer founder of L5. Oh, Chieko! What's this, Mom? Well, it was supposed to be a surprise, but you're a little too fast for me. Do you like it? I love it. Thank you. You're welcome. [WHISTLING] CHIEKO: My father was a flight commander, an engineer. He'd explored almost all of the inner planets, and now he was designing an expedition to the Neptune system. When we wasn't working, you could almost always find him at home in the kitchen. Every kitchen at L5 had a built-in hydroponic garden. [BEEPING] The big farms on the inner ring were hydroponic too, though sometimes we used moon soil. What can I do now, Nancy? You can help me collect the cucumbers. CHIEKO: In many ways, it was just like Earth here. We grew all kinds of fruits and vegetables as they do, but in space, we could control the amount of sunlight and the seasons so that everything was available all year round. I loved to grow things. Back then, I wanted to be a farmer. [CHICKENS CLUCKING, GOATS BLEATING] Here on level two, all of the farms fit into only 150 acres. We raised the usual animals, but not very many cows. They took up too much space. Hi, Alice. Hi, Andy. Come on. Good girl. [BEEPING] [CHICKS PEEPING] Hi, duckies. CHIEKO: Of course, I visited Earth farms on virtual trips, but still, I often wondered what it would really be like to lie in a field and watch the clouds roll by. I knew all about Earth's giant oceans and rivers, but it was hard to imagine so much water. Every drop of ours had to be imported and recycled. L5 was a world of perfect harmony and balance. Then everything changed. MAN: I've been doing some calculations... CHIEKO: It began one day when I went to visit my grandfather at his lab. I was surprised to see my father there too. FATHER: The amount of fuel it would take to lift the water... CHIEKO: I'll never forget what I heard. Our life-support systems had reached their limit. Unless more water could be found soon, there wouldn't be enough to sustain us all. I have something to show you, Mori. CHIEKO: My grandfather was L5's senior scientist. He'd been searching for a solution to our dilemma. COMPUTERIZED VOICE: Comet velocity-- 22.3 kilometers per second. You know, this just might work. It's an ideal size. We wouldn't have to change the orbit very much. COMPUTERIZED VOICE: Hinckley's diameter is 5.72 kilometers. CHIEKO: Almost 500 million miles away from us, a comet was approaching Jupiter. The tumbling mass at its core was actually a giant reservoir of water. All right... this is Jupiter. This is the path of the comet. If we were to put a rocket on the comet and divert it towards Earth, it would pass L5 every few years and supply us with all the water we would ever need. Still, it would take a powerful rocket to change the direction that much. No, no, no, not at all. Jupiter's gravity has more power than any rocket we could ever dream of, and I have the data from a hundred years ago to prove it. Chieko, lend me a hand here. Come and help me explain something to your father... CHIEKO: My grandfather had led the first expeditions to the moons of Jupiter many years before. Now that my father had succeeded him as flight commander, Grandpa had turned his attention to the study of comets. What is it? GRANDFATHER: Now, this is Jupiter as it was seen by a spacecraft called Galileo 100 years ago. CHIEKO:: Is that another comet? Indeed it is. A comet called Shoemaker-Levy 9 was passing nearby. [EXPLOSION] What happened? Jupiter's gravity is so powerful it broke the comet apart and sucked the pieces into its atmosphere. Now, if this force was strong enough to pull Shoemaker-Levy off course... MORI: Then we could use some of that power to change the orbit of our comet. Precisely. So you see, Mori, Jupiter will do most of the work for us. All we need to do is attach a small rocket to the comet to get it there. What do you think? CHIEKO: So began the first attempt to capture a comet. COMPUTERIZED VOICE: Transport at 1.3 A.U. CHIEKO: A robot rocket was launched from L5. When it found the comet, it would attach itself and wait for the command to fire. Four months later, the critical time had come. The rocket had now reached the comet. They had sent the command to fire. We should have seen a vector change by now. COMPUTERIZED VOICE: Malfunction. Negative berth. There's no power. There's no motion at all. Plasma traps are okay. Pressure's fine. I don't get it. Let's run the ignition simulation. That may tell us something. COMPUTERIZED VOICE: Autosequence start. See, there's nothing that could shake loose. COMPUTERIZED VOICE: Negative berth. Wait a second. [WHOOSH] Could be the nozzle. CHIEKO: A chunk of debris was jammed in the rocket's exhaust. Unless they could clear it and fire the rocket, the comet would continue on its path, forever lost. Shut down by one speck of dirt. Not necessarily. What do you propose we do? I could go and fix it. You can't be serious. No one has ever even thought about landing on a comet. Why not? Icould be there in two months, clean everything up, and you'd still be in time for the course correction. CHIEKO: And so my father began to prepare for the mission of his life. I was too young to grasp how dangerous his mission really was. I was busy playing with my friends on Earth. COMPUTERIZED VOICE: Earth call for Chieko. GIRL: Hi, Chieko. Pips. What's up? Not much. What you doing? CHIEKO: Sometimes I would visit them, and sometimes they'd come here. Let's go somewhere else today. Like where? Um... I don't know. We could go to the zoo. I've got an idea. Meet me on channel 29, okay? Okay, see you there. [SPEAKERPHONE DISCONNECTS] CHIEKO: With virtual travel, we could meet anywhere we wanted. Once you'd scanned in your destination, you could bring in your friends to explore it with you. [WHOOSH] [CHILDREN LAUGHING] Frosty's looking good. Brilliant, Chieko. I got Chas, Matty, and Kristen to come too. Hey, Chieko. How do you like it? Wow! I love it. Look what I found. It's fantastic. Yippee! This is so fun. Let's play hide-and-seek. Yeah. Bet you can't catch me. ALL: Bet we can. Ready or not, here we come. Here I am. Where'd she go? Catch me. Got you. Oh, goody. How'd you do that? I know. Let's play knights and dragons. Yeah, what should I be? Yeah, great idea. I'm going to be the queen. Aren't these great? Do I look good? How do I look? Don't I look beautiful? What's wrong? Sorry, guys, I got to go. See you. Bye. Bye, Chieko. [WHOOSH] MORI: Did I say something wrong? MOTHER: No. What is it, then? Nothing. Tell me what's the matter. You know perfectly well what's the matter. Come on, Jenny. It's no different from my last six flights. There's nothing to worry about. You know as well as I do nobody's ever done this before. You have no idea what could happen. Well, I know what will happen if I don't go. We can just chuck everything we've been trying to do here and go back home to Earth. You know that's not what I meant. [WATER RUNNING] It's about time. Mom's been calling you. What about a story? Would you like that? Why don't you hop into your jammies and do your teeth? Daddy will come and tuck you in, okay? CHIEKO: I'd never heard my parents talk that way before. I didn't understand what my father had meant when he said "go back home to Earth." Even if I did have lots of friends and family there, my home was here at L5, and I had never, ever thought of leaving it, even for a planet as beautiful as Earth. I was beginning to think you forgot all about me. Night. [BEEPING] Now, what story shall I tell you? Shall we go to Io or back to the whales? Daddy? Yeah? What is it, Chieko? You'll come back, won't you? I'm right here. I'm not going anywhere. No, I mean, will you come back from the comet? Of course I will. You know me. Piece of cake. And I'll bring you back a real snowball. Deal? Deal. Okay. Now, once upon a time, there was a big, blue whale, and he swam and he swam and he swam until he reached the magic... [SHIP BLASTS OFF] GRANDFATHER: Mori, we're with you all the way. Good luck. CHIEKO: From the moment he left, things just weren't the same for me. It would be weeks before he reached the comet, but at least we could talk to him before he moved beyond the range of realtime communication. MORI: No deltas to the flight plan. Everything's nominal. On time, on course. [STATIC] A little more solar activity than we predicted, but I don't think it's anything to worry about. I'll keep an eye on it. How's Chieko? Chieko's just fine. MORI: I'm getting fat on all those cookies she made. I miss you. I miss you too, Mori. CHIEKO: My mother put on a brave face for me. [GOATS BLEATING] We both tried in our own ways to keep our spirits up, but I couldn't help thinking about my father and how far away he was. Bye-bye. CHIEKO: Grandpa was the only one who really knew how perilous my father's journey had now become. With each passing day and night, the solar storm was intensifying. If transmission was cut off and my father's ship malfunctioned, we would never know. At such a great distance, a rescue team might never reach him in time. MORI: Closing at 10 meters per second. CHIEKO: I'll always remember the day he landed. We gathered together to watch. MORI: 100 meters. 90... 80... 70... 60... Ten meters... Nine... Eight... Seven... Six... Five meters... Three... Two... One. I'm on it. Yes! COMPUTERIZED VOICE: EMV pod separation maneuver in five seconds... four, three, two, one. Mark. EMV pod is clear. [ALARM SOUNDING] COMPUTERIZED VOICE: Stabilizer malfunction. Manual guidance system enabled. MORI: Okay, I'm going in. MORI: I've located the problem here. I'll have to try a manual disable. Did you copy that? A manual disable. This engine is still armed. COMPUTERIZED VOICE: Warning. Minimum safety distance. Warning. Propulsion system is armed. Standing by for your instructions. COMPUTERIZED VOICE: Detecting ionic interference. Severe solar interference. CHIEKO: Grandpa's worst fears were coming true. A massive solar flare erupted, jamming all the transmissions. [SIREN BEEPING] Mori, this is L5. We've had a loss of signal and telemetry here. Please advise your status. CHIEKO: Then we lost contact altogether. We sent out call after call, and then we waited... and waited. It seemed to be the longest day of my life. By nightfall, still nothing. GRANDFATHER: We are standing by. [COMPUTERIZED VOICE SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] [STATIC AND BUZZING] Mori! L5... ignition confirmed. Mori, vector change confirms. It's moving, Mori. The comet is moving. CHIEKO: Telemetry showed the rocket had fired, but there was no word from my father. [COMPUTERIZED VOICE SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] MORI: L5, are you there? Well, I just made it in the nick of time. Looked like a beautiful bird. Looks like I'll be home for Chieko's birthday. See you soon. [LAUGHING] CHIEKO: I knew then that we would never forget this day. The comet and its water were ours and the future of L5 looked bright. [CHIEKO GIGGLES] CHIEKO: 30 years have passed since my story began. Our robots have retrieved yet another piece of the comet and are bringing it home to process exactly as my grandfather had planned. Not long ago, I was elected mayor of L5. We have built a second city here, and our port in space is now 20,000 strong. Our dream has come true. At last, we are citizens of the solar system.
