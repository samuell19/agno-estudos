(suspenseful music) (lighter clicks) (fire roaring and crackling) (mysterious piano music) (sirens wailing) - Fire can warm up cold days, can cook food for the hungry. But can it clean up sins? Yes, I've sinned. But what choice do I have now? My name is Laura. And I'm about to do something I really don't wanna do. Hey. - Laura. Something awful just happened. - I'm leaving you. - What? - I've been offered a job in Hong Kong. - You're leaving, for how long? - Indefinitely. - What do you mean? - I already made my decision. - Wait. Look can we at least discuss this before you leave? - No, you don't understand. We are done. - Done? - I'll stay at Susan's. Until I leave. - Laura. - I'll come back later to pack. - Can you please tell me what's going on? - I just don't love you anymore. - [Gus] Yes, I've sinned. The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for a good man to do nothing. I am that good man. I was that good man. You okay? - I'm fine. - Detective Sofia Vasquez. - Nice to meet you. You were there last night, I remember you. - Yeah. I didn't know you two know each other. Or that you are, sorry, Your Honor, I just started. - Marcus. Your Honor is for judges. - Right, sir, uh, Marcus. Soon I hear, huh? You're gonna be a-- - Why don't you go grab me a cup of coffee? And one of those thingies, those, uh, danishes with the cherries? And don't forget the stirrer. - Me? - Yeah. - Okay. My pleasure. - It's good training. And don't look at me like that, I didn't say anything. - Half the body. I don't understand, why was was half the body burned? - Are you sure there isn't anything you wanna tell me? - Is there something you expect me to tell you? I had dinner at the marina with a friend, didn't wanna drive all the way back home, boat's closer. What's on your mind? - And you weren't expecting anybody? - Is that what this is about? You think I'm having an affair? (sighs) - No. (tense music) - [Newscaster] Last night, a torched body was found in the proximity of a prominent district attorney's boat. The unidentified body is Caucasian. Officers suspect Jane Doe's death may be linked to an illegal sex trafficking in the-- (stereo button clicks) (suspenseful music) - [Marcus] Yes, I have sinned. Quiet rage can devour a man. It informs every act, every thought, every feeling. It imprisons, leaving no choice. (children laughing and playing) - Are you lost, my friend? Hello Marcus. - I'm not the one who's lost. - Congratulations on your impending judgeship. Now you can make your crusade against me that much more effective. Well done. That was quite the bonfire in front of your boat. - Are you telling me that was you playing the hero last night? - Well I'm not saying I was, I'm not saying I wasn't. - Mary, you scared me half to death. - Oh well, back to the hunt. It's the call of the wild, you know. - Sometimes hunters end up turning into prey. - [Newscaster] The body of Megan Little was found today. Little, the Sunrise Elementary student mysteriously disappeared-- - Hey are we getting double pay or how's that work? 'Cause we're on both the Jane Doe and the Little girl's case at the same time. Hmm? Are you gonna eat this? - No. It's not for you. - So who's it for, then? You married? - No. - Ever been? - No. - Have you had any serious relationships? - No. - Any children? - No. - Alright. You know what, you don't have to share your entire life story with me but I do think that sharing would be good for you. You look a little clenched, doesn't suit your complexion that well. - I'll make sure to take your suggestion under careful consideration. (pensive music) (birds calling) - He must have removed everything to make it difficult to identify her. But surely he would know that we could compare DNA. Her teeth, she's not gonna be a Jane Doe forever. - Well she could be. If nobody reports her missing. - [Sofia] What do you mean? - What you gonna compare the DNA with? - Hmm. - Why don't you go have a look around the boat? - What for? - Clues. (groans) Hi. Care for something to eat? - Does it come with a beer? (sighs) - This your usual spot? - As of lately. - Well, I was just wondering if you were the guy that kept an eye on what goes on around here. - You mean you need a full report on the habits of the fauna of this area? - No, not really. Maybe one or two particular specimens. - I'm assuming you're referring to the individual who played with matches last night and got burnt. - Yes, I am. Did you see what happened? - No. - You just said you saw the fire. - I said nothing of the kind. You should pay attention to semantics. A good education will take you a long way. - Okay well you implied. - I became aware of the accident only after your sirens so abruptly dislodged me from Morpheus's arms. - Nothing else? - Someone was watching and then he ran away. - Could you describe this person? - No. - Sure you could. Male, female, tall, short, black, white? - It was hooded. At any rate, it was after you guys arrived. - After we arrived? (tense music) - [Homeless Man] After. - His name is David Sheffer, Dr. David Sheffer. I want you to find out where he was last night. If he was anywhere near the fire. Without making any waves. None. That clear? (knocking) - Hey Marcus. - Hi Dora. - [Mary] Are you gonna come read me my book? - [Dora] Of course! - Hello Mary. Hey, that's a nice book, I read that. Did you enjoy the park today? - Yep. - I was there. I won't say anything. - Marcus. Okay honey it's time for bed. Go up okay, I'll be there to tuck you in in a minute. - Mommy are you gonna come kiss me goodnight? - Wild horses couldn't keep me away. So Jean is here. (tense music) And we have another guest. Bug eyes really don't suit you, my dear. See if you can do something about that. - Hmm. - Marcus, so nice to see you. We thought it was about time to put you two in the same room. You've been traveling in the same circles but never been formally introduced to each other, right? - Right. And we are all friends here. - We're all concerned about, well, not a nice package to receive in front of one's door, really. - Oh and in such a gruesome way. Burnt with bare legs, it was just awful. - Mommy, you're not coming. - Excuse me. - Yeah we got a story to read, Christine. Okay look you shouldn't have him in your home. He is a dangerous man. - We've known David a long time. He's eccentric, but he's harmless. - You have no idea who he really is. - And you do? - Yeah. We knew each other when we were kids. - You did? - You have to trust me on this one. - So you knew each other when you were children. And why haven't we heard of this before? - Look I am dead serious, Christine. - No, why are you hiding this? What, is there some kind of childhood feud still going on, because if there is, you need to get over it. - Promise me you will never let him anywhere near Mary. - What do you mean? What about Mary? (thunder rumbling) (rain pattering) - They're totally booked until next month. - What, they only have one table? - What do you want me to do? - [Susan] Hold my calls. - Hi. Okay. I need the keys. My flight is in about a week. That okay with you? - Mi casa y tu casa. So you're really doing this. - I, uh, can't stay anymore. - Why? What happened that so terrible that you feel like you have to leave your life and your friends? Did you kill someone, steal, pillage, what? Please. Talk to me. What about your patients? - They'll manage. - Heartless. - Yeah well, I don't think I'm doing a great job anyway. - So now it's self-pity. - Damn, Susan. Stop hitting me with the judging stick and be a friend for once. I know, I... I'll miss you too. - Alright. - See you at your place? - Don't you wanna get dinner? (tense music) Can't get a table in this weather anyway. - That seat is taken. - I though skin discrimination was a vice of the south. (sighs) So may I? - Suit yourself. - Scotch. - Neat? - On the rocks, thank you. Finally stopped raining. Got a cigarette? - No, I don't smoke, not anymore. - I'm not sure about this one. - Excuse me? - I don't know if you can handle it. - I can handle it. - Can you now? - Captain with all due respect, I'm off-duty. - In the 20 years I've been in this precinct I have never seen you take your eyes off of him. For Christ's sake Gus, you're too close to it, you're like his fucking godfather! (laughs) Besides, you're still working on that Little girl case. - Yeah well there may be a connection. - How so? - He's gonna be the prosecutor on that case. - Well no shit there's a connection. - Do you ever read my reports or do you just wipe your ass-- - Hey, language! I'm a lady. What are your leads? - Well so far it's just someone that showed up after we got there. - After you got there? - Yeah. - So they may have seen nothing. - They may have seen nothing. - Says who? - Some homeless guy. - Hmm. Just the word of a drunk, that's it? - Thought social discrimination was a vice of the rich. - I'm taking you off the case. Tell me why I shouldn't. (scoffs) Why do you wanna compromise your pension? This is your last case, go retire happy! (scoffs) Don't look for trouble. Alright then, fine. Go ahead. But don't screw me over on this. You hear me, Wolf? I don't want those guys in IAD breaking my balls about this. - Thought you were a lady. - Well, alright then, thanks for the drink. By the way, I signed you up for a high school service program. All you have to do is speak to some high school kids about police protocol. - Why don't you give that to Ryder? - No, I'm giving it to you. Besides, they asked to speak to the ogre and that's you, right? Isn't that what they call you down in RH? (laughs) Just talk to the damn kid and answer his questions. (tense music) - [Newscaster] The California State Supreme Court has refused to overturn the sentence of convicted murdered Gabriel Voralik who is awaiting execution on death row. This opens the way to his death sentence to be carried out as all avenues of appeal have been exhausted, despite Voralik insisting he is innocent. Los Angeles District Attorney Marcus Rigoni who, as a newly-minted assistant district attorney was the prosecutor on the case, said that justice has been served and the citizens of Los Angeles can rest easy in their beds at night knowing that this predator is off the streets for good. Voralik's trial is the case that catapulted the young ADA into the spotlight. He is currently being considered for a judgeship. - Thank you. - Are you okay? - I'm fine. - I worry about you. - I know you do. I'm okay, truly. - A burnt body at your feet, Marcus? That's nothing to take lightly. Is someone sending you a message? - Diane. - Oh, Gus. You have only one minute. He has a 9:30 meeting and a 10 depo, you understand? - Yes ma'am. - Cream and sugar? - Oh, you don't have the time. - So I hear you've been doing a little surveillance on the side. It's not my first day at the races, you know. - Know your enemy. - Hmm. Well. Look-- - But don't touch. Yeah, I know. Last time I checked the park was a public place. - I'm only looking out for you. - Is that what you do? You look out for me? - Don't get pissed and me 'cause I'm reining you in. I'm on your side. (sighs) - He was there that night, at the pier. - Yeah. Sheffer, I suspected that. - 9:25. To go. - I'll call you. Thanks, Diane. - Ah, you're always welcome, Gus. Don't be a stranger now, you hear. - Coffee good? - Coffee's good. It wasn't supposed to be to go. - So who's the ogre? - Where the hell'd you hear that? - Guys at RH told me to ask you. - Assholes. - You get what you give, you know? - Why don't you turn right here? Let's get off this street, it's too busy. (pensive music) - Oh, here you are. You wanna go in? - Uh, no, that's okay. What'd you find? - She died from a skull fracture. She was already dead when she was set on fire. - [Sofia] Oh thank god. - No congenital anomalies, healthy, between 30 and 40 if she took care of herself. Empty stomach. - Oh, good, that oughta narrow things down. - How about pregnant, four weeks? Would that do? (suspenseful music) - Do you believe in evil? - What? As in the dark falling angel? - [Gus] Kinda. - [Marcus] No, I wouldn't call that evil, just plain devolution. - [Gus] Well, they're really both saying the same thing. - [Marcus] Or maybe not. - [Gus] What do you mean? - I mean evil is a definition that precludes a sense of fate, something that one cannot fight. What I'm saying is that it's a disease and it should be cured. Or exterminated like cancer, at any cost. However one should see fit. After all, the only thing necessary for the triumph of evil-- - Are you saying that I behave like a spectator? - Yeah, that's exactly what I'm saying. - [Ryder] Wolf, will you please return your damn messages? - What? - Some Logan kid is burning up the lines looking for you. The latest on the Little girl. - [Gus] Yeah, what's it say? - The alley where they found her, some old pro works the corner at the end, she goes by Sharon. I'm trying to locate her. Do you think these could be the legs of a pro? - Oh come on, come on. You must be missing. (knocks) I have an idea. DNA doesn't match any missing persons. - I'm not surprised. - Somebody knew her. She was pregnant. - Uh huh, okay. - [Sofia] So maybe she had a boyfriend, someone who was intimate with her legs, her feet. - Continue. - I have an idea. - Have you told Wolf? - He doesn't seem too receptive. - You really gonna let her do that? - Why not? - 'Cause it's idiotic. I don't think we should. - It may work. - Well nothing's gonna come of it. - Why, because it was her idea? What? You don't wanna find out who she is? (sighs) Leave no stones unturned. (tense music) - [Woman] Sheer disgust, I mean my kid almost clicked on the site with this filth. They actually show this unspeakable result of highly-charged violence on a police site! Not to mention having to shield my son from the fliers as well. - [Man] Look, desperate times call for desperate measures, right? - [Marcus] Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. There's no telling which one they'll like best. - Well I'll give 'em both then. Tired of second guessing. - Catching is a difficult art. (sighs) - It shouldn't be this way. (pensive music) - Is that why you're leaving the force? - [Gus] I don't understand this world anymore. - [Marcus] There have been Sheffers since the beginning of time. It's always been this way. - Has it? I guess I just keep watching the same movie expecting a different ending. - [Marcus] There's always hope. - The other day I was stuck in traffic. Neither lane moving, not an inch. I look in the rear view, this guy comes up turning right. Goes all the way up to the front, forces himself back in, just like that, no remorse, no nothing. Didn't even suffer any consequences. Didn't get a ticket, nobody honked, no nothing, nothing happened to him. Meanwhile, that guy's getting home sooner and the rest of us schmucks are sitting back stuck in traffic. You know you'd think somewhere, somehow, somebody's out there keeping score. You know, balancing the acts. But it doesn't work that way. You can scream out to the universe that you've been wronged, yell, stomp, curse, jump up and down til the cows come home. It doesn't work like that, it's not gonna listen. You know why? 'Cause the universe is too busy ignoring you. - We're never gonna nail him, are we? (sighs) (thunder rumbling) (rain pattering) - Christ, you scared me. - [David] Now now, let's not go using the lord's name in vain, shall we? - What do you want? - [David] That's a superfluous question. - I can't do it. - [David] Sure you can. - No I can't, we broke up. - [David] Well that's a bummer. Wouldn't you say so? - That wouldn't exactly be my choice of words, no. - So what are we going to do now? - We? - Well yes we, we're in this together, you know that. (scoffs) - You're crazy. - So they say. - I can't help you. I'm sorry, I just can't. (suspenseful music) - You've been a naughty girl, Doctor. Naughty, naughty, naughty. I've been counting on you and now you've gone and broken up with him. - He broke up with me. He's in love with someone else. I have no chance in hell to sway that man. What could have possibly made you think I could? You picked the wrong person. I'm nothing to him. Nothing. - Oh you poor baby. - So I accepted a job in China. - I'm sorry, what? - I'm of no use to you. - Well I'm afraid that can be a problem. - And what are you exactly expecting me to do? Lock him up in a closet? - Well I don't know dear. You'll have to think. Employ some of that ingenuity with which you've been so abundantly bestowed. - I'm fresh out. - You still have a few days. - There's nothing I can do. - Get him off my back, dear. You wouldn't want him to know that he's been harboring a viper, would you? So stop him. Okay pumpkin? - You're a sick man. - And you're being redundant. - Alright, I'm done with you. - Uh uh uh. Not too hasty now. You have much to lose. - [Laura] And what would that exactly be? - Well that's for me to know and you to continue to guess. We've gone over this already. - [Laura] You got nothing on me. - Oh, faith. It's the opium of the masses. (murmuring on television) - Hey Laura, do you want dinner? - Uh, I just have some things to do. - You wanna watch a movie later? - Yeah, later. - Hey hey hey hey! Laura, where you going? - Just going for a walk. - It's raining outside. - Gotta go. (rain pattering) - Go upstairs. - Why? - I said go upstairs. - Why can't I stay? - Go upstairs. - No, I wanna stay. - Now! (scoffs) - This place. 15 years. Nothing has changed. Even the ages of your girlfriends. - Rent control. And control. - Take down the tape. - What tape? - Don't feign ignorance. You're not Rob De Niro. - The hell are you talking about? - The video. You, Jackson, and I. You posted it on internet. - I didn't post anything. What are you, insane? Why would I do that? I thought you destroyed this video. - I did. Well I threw it away. (phone ringing) - Vasquez! Vasquez! - Oh. Uh oh okay so today's a tuna sandwich. - Yeah, with onions. You seen Vasquez? - Uh, I think she went for the day, I just saw her leaving. (scoffs) Anyway, you got a visitor. - Who? - That Logan kid, he refuses to leave until he sees you. (sighs) Who the hell is he, anyway? - Some community outreach bullshit Wilkins got me into. I told her you were a better man, she didn't believe me. - Asshole. - Oh. Yeah, uh, sorry about that. I got a little busy around here. - I understand. Is that the body they found at the docks? Has the identity been discovered? Why only half-burned? - What can I do for you? - I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions. I'm writing an article about police protocol. - Yeah well I've only got a minute. Actually half, so you've got two questions, go. - Has it ever happened that after a conviction you find exculpatory evidence? - It's been known to happen, yes. - Well I was wondering, what do you do? Do you let the convict free, do you admit your mistake, or do you let the arrest remain? - Well you correct the mistake, of course. We send the evidence over to the DA who in turn appeals to the governor. - Well. - Well what? - I really don't buy that. - That's 'cause we're not selling anything to you, kid. - Yeah, but you're making it sound like justice always prevails when we know that's not the case. You've made mistakes. Sometimes it's not fair. - No it's not fair, nobody said it was fair. Life's not fair. What are you writing about in this article anyway, philosophical quandaries? - Alright, alright. Let's forget that. - Is there anything else? - No. Thank you. You've made your point. I have enough. - Alright, good, nice talking to you. Good luck with the article. - Thank you. There's some nasty business going on here. (tense music) (phone ringing) - Hey. No. Logan? That doesn't ring a bell. - So he's a student at Columbus High School if that helps. - [Marcus] Columbus? - What? - Yeah he was a guest speaker at Columbus. - Sheffer? - Mm hmm. This boy, blue hair? - Yes. - I don't think that's a coincidence. - Alright you stay put. I'll handle this. - Alright. - Marcus? - Mm hmm? - Nothing, I gotta go. (pensive music) (crying) (phone vibrating) - Who are you? Who are you? (shutter clicking) - Oh, photography. You're finally giving up your day job. - You should try avoid being seen in the proximity of your puppet. - Yeah so I see that you've figured that out. - Yeah 'cause you're such a craftsman. - Well you made it so easy for me, really. It's a piece of cake. Father condemned to public execution by you. Youth. So malleable. At least in my hands. - Really? There is no end to your delusions. - Look at the mess you've made. You're so self-righteous, aren't you? With your impeccable suits and your immaculate shirts. Coming from where? Saville Row? You know what I see? I see an expensive Romany Conte with a cork that's been tainted by air. A bottle that sold for thousands at Christie's and then upon opening is discovered to become host to thousands of bacteria, virulent yeasts all coming for dinner. Time may have given you cover to hide, but I can still see that look in your eye. That pain we both share. You haven't forgotten. You and I, we are kindred spirits. - Don't flatter yourself. - Oh but we are, Marcus. We are, you know that we are. We've shared so much. - I didn't become a predator. - That's a minor detail. - No. No, we're different beasts. - But beasts all the same. (suspenseful music) (explosion booming) (flames crackling) - Got him. Dumbass didn't even think about a CC camera. First a burnt body, now a bomb. Someone is sending a message to his honorable. - Hold it. Hold it right there. Can you zoom in on that? - Can't do any more on this, it's a low-res file. - [Gus] What is that on his coat? - Looks like a small shield. (tense music) - Huh. - Voralik, his name is Justin Voralik? But he came into the station with a false name? - Yeah Logan must be his mother's name. They think we're not doing our jobs. - Hey there's no miscarriage of justice here, his father is guilty. - [Gus] No thanks, I quit. - Since when? - I'm not kidding, I quit, really. - Sheffer. He's the one making up lies, winding him up. - [Gus] Sick fuck. - How are we gonna get into that garage legally? - [Gus] We have no basis for a search warrant. - At the moment. (doorbell rings) (lighter clicks) - Hey. - [Gus] You look a little groggy, you sick? - Not really. - You're crying. - No. My nose gets congested and my eyes produce water every time I'm upset. No smoking in the studio. - Ah. - I can't have them coughing when they cry. - [Gus] Yeah. (sighs) - When are you gonna quit? - Soon. - Yeah. - He told me. - Mm hmm. - So, when? - In a few days. - Listen, I just wanted to say that I'm really sorry for you two. - Yeah well. How's he doing? - Coping. - Does he talk about me? - He said that you left. Firewall after that. - Is he still onto Sheffer? - Like a pit bull. - That man's gonna be the death of him. - Yeah, I know, I tried to warn him several times that he's a sick man, he should stay the hell away from him. - Gus. - What? (pensive music) - Promise me you'll keep him out of trouble, you hear? Promise me. Do everything you can. Everything. No matter what. - Yeah. I will. This time I will. I promise. - [Newscaster] Another child whom local authorities will not presently name was found dead today just beyond Bradley Park. The sheriff's office again refuses to comment any further. Not wanting to foil the now three unfolding investigations with as many dead bodies. - Christine, I'm so sorry. - No there's nothing to be sorry about. I just came down here to tell you that that's not my girl in there. - Trust me. - I said no. Now you can't force me to go in there, that's not my girl, okay? I'm telling you, that is not my girl. - Trust me. - You can't force me to go in there! Go tell some other mother because that's not my girl. You bastard! That's not my girl in there! That's not my girl. Bastard, that's not my girl! That's not my girl! That's not my girl, that's not! (wailing) - I should cancel my meeting. I can reschedule. I'll go a few days after you leave. - Don't, I hate goodbyes. - And yet you're leaving. - Don't start. - Bitch. - You bitch. - You done packing? You done? - Almost. Need to finish up in my studio. I can't find a key, I may have lost it on the boat. I'm gonna go check there. - Well. - Well what? - Well can you tell me now? - Tell you what? - The real reason you're leaving. - Uh... Great job offer, new life, maybe a family. (laughs) - Okay, now tell me the Cinderella one. - Sweetie, I have my reasons. - You see? I know when you're bullshitting. - I, uh... Committed a crime. - [Susan] You what? - I was young, I fell in love with Jackson Brandt, we were stu-- - Wait wait wait wait. Jackson Brandt? The lunatic Jackson Brandt who technically-- - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Misguided ideals. They plan an attack. Jackson died on a run before anything happened, I was waiting in a house. - Wait, is this why you're leaving? That's crazy! Laura, you didn't commit a crime. No crime was actually committed. Alright, this is nuts. Cancel your flight. - It was treason. You know how he feels. I... I couldn't bear that. - Don't tell him, who's gonna know? - I'm a liability right now. I may come back in a couple of years when he's already on his judgeship and once he's on the bench there's really nothing I could affect but right now, right now I need to get out of the way. - Okay what do you mean, affect? Wait, what do you mean by that? Laura! - I'm being blackmailed. - By whom? - Sheffer. - Well how the fuck does he know? - There's a tape that wasn't destroyed of me and Jackson and another. We were supposed to use it when claiming our act. - Oh shit. - He wants me to sway Marcus, get him off his back. I have to leave. - That man has no business being on the wrong side of jail. He's gonna get his comeuppance. (garbled speaking on police radio) (suspenseful music) - [Newscaster] Police have now confirmed that Dr. David Sheffer, found murdered in his home, has been linked to the deaths of three young girls. They are continuing their investigation. - He had it coming, right? So a few more days, what are you gonna do with all that free time? Oh come on, just a little chitchat, Jesus Christ. - I don't know. Might get myself a new boat. - Oh yeah? You in some swimming trunks? Thanks for that lovely picture. Man when I heard I was gonna train with you I nearly shit my pants. You're a legend. - Not that glamorous. - Oh in those swimming trunks you are. - [Gus] Easy now. - No I bet you're the star of all your AARP meetings. - I said easy. (sighs) - So I was thinking. - Yeah? Tell it to Wilkins. - Well you didn't wanna hear it. - How many people came forward? How many people recognized those legs? Just useless theatrics. - We all have our own style. - Yeah, clearly. - God damnit, do you wanna know what I'm thinking or not? - [Gus] Okay, go ahead. - I'm thinking of that pro, Sharon. - [Gus] Yeah that's a popular thought. - Yeah, let's say Jane Doe wasn't there by chance. Let's say she was there to talk to Marcus, to tell him something. Let's say Jane Doe was (phone ringing) a witness that could have put Sheffer in a compromising position. - Wolf. Yeah. Alright, be right there. - [Sofia] Where are we going now? - Courthouse. Get a search warrant. They found a missing link between Justin and the explosives. - [Diane] Here's that witness statement. - What witness? - That Jane Doe. Apparently a homeless man saw someone fleeing the pier that night. - Leave it on my desk. (tense music) - Hey. Well, I'm becoming popular here. - Do you recognize this boy? Well? - I know who you are. You're the guy from the boat. - Please, it's important. - Yes. Quid pro quo? He was here. The night of the fire. Watching. And he ran away. - Did you tell that to the police? - I don't recall any alcoholic beverage exchange involved. (suspenseful music) (pensive music) (murmuring) - Of all the joints in the world she had to walk into mine. - There you go. I'll have whatever he's having. - Why are you here? - Thirst is a bitch. Oh. I wanted to tell you I've made rank so I'm gonna be taking over your beat soon when you're gone. Not gone as in dead, but gone. - Congratulations, remind me to bake a cake. - You know you're a fucking prick sometimes, Wolf. If you don't mind me saying so. I get it, you're a no bullshit cop, you've cleared every single one of your cases, you're really good at what you do. But when it comes to personal relationships you haven't got a fucking clue. You don't let anyone get close to you. You boss me around treating me like shit. What did I ever do to you, huh? And then you have me sitting in some bar talking to you like some girly girl and that's not like me so fuck you Wolf. If you don't mind me saying so. - [Gus] I loved a woman once. - Yeah? What happened? - It was my best friend's wife. My best friend. He was like a brother. And here I was having an affair with his wife. I think he knew but he never said anything. 10 years of torture. - 10 years. Then what happened? - They took him away. Away from me, I presume. But the kid came back. - The kid, what kid? - They had a kid. - It's the kid, he's back here now and he's living here? You see him? Yeah? - Every day. I see him every day. - He's your kid, isn't he? Does he know? You may regret that one day. - Yeah, well, it sounds like a family trait. - What do you mean? - Don't hang on me, kid, I am not the man you think I am. Hell, I'm not the man I think I am. Not anymore. - Why? What happened? - I'm giving into my guilt. - Well look at that. Nice and clean. He blows up a car and then falls under a bus. And you saw all these from where you were standing. - Yes ma'am. - You had a clear view. - Yes ma'am. (chuckles) - And it was an accident? - Yes ma'am. - He just tripped. - Yes ma'am. - Nobody pushed him. - No ma'am. - So poetic justice, huh? Well now, you can finally go fishing. - Hmm. And Jane Doe? - Archives, unsolved. Too bad it was your last one. - I'll live. - You're gonna miss this, you know. - Hmm. It's only hardware. - Gus! Gus oh my god, thank god you're here. It's Laura. I was away for a few days and I just came back in (tense music) and there was a message on the voicemail. It's from her people in China, Gus, she never arrived. If she's not here, she's not there, where is she? (pensive music) - [Marcus Voiceover] Yes, I have sinned. Quiet rage can devour a man. It informs every act, every thought, every feeling. It imprisons. Leaving no choice. - They will find out. - You know? - I know. I understand you killing Sheffer, I do. But why the Voralik boy? - He was the hooded person at the pier that night. He saw me by the fire. He may have wanted to testify that he saw me killing the woman and then torching her. He may have even believed it. He arrived late to the party, after all. But I didn't burn her. And I didn't kill her. (dramatic music) - You didn't? You didn't kill her? - She fell. Hit her head. I didn't kill her. And Sheffer? Well somebody had to do it. Well if not me, who, huh? Who else is gonna take the trash out of the streets, huh? You? (scoffs) No. Oh not you. (laughing) Oh not a good candidate. You just stay there and watch. Pretend not to see. A spectator! - Marcus, please. - So why are you here now, huh? You wanna talk? You finally ready to talk? 'Cause you may hear something that you've been masterfully ignoring for the last 30 years! - Yes, I'm ready to talk, I want it to be over with. - Why? Why did you let him do it? Why did you let him do that to me? You knew. You knew what my father used to do to me. You knew! To me! And my best friend, David Sheffer. (scoffs) Like I said. A spectator. I got nothing else to say to you. - Marcus. (gun fires) (dreamy music) - Hey. I lost my cabinet key. Found it. Are you okay? I'm sorry Marcus. Please talk to me, I'm so sorry! - I'm sorry. - Please talk to me. I'm so sorry! - You broke my heart! (cries out) Laura? Laura? (lighter clicks) (fire roaring and crackling) (gun fires) (coughs) - No no no no no. No. This time I was there for you. No no no no no no! (crying) - If that call never came to Susan she would have been a Jane Doe forever, hmm? - So what are you gonna do now? - Me? I don't know. About what? - He's all alone in the world now. - That's how he likes it. - Chicken. - I'm not. - I understand. Those empty shoes are mighty big. (pensive music) - Hey. Okay, enough with the silent treatment already, come on. It's a nice boat. You ever take it out to sea at all? See I couldn't, I just couldn't because I have this ear thing you know and then my whole balance gets thrown off and I just-- - Sofia. - What? - Why don't you go grab the spare rod in the state room? - [Sofia] Inside? - Yeah, it's by the bed. - Okay. (suspenseful music) Holy shit. You removed everything to make it difficult to identify her. It was you. That's why you didn't want to put her on display in the glass case, isn't it? - She was already dead. - Laura? Laura? - [Gus] It was an accident, a freaky accident. He didn't kill her. I didn't know that then. I didn't see her fall. I had just got there. I used to motor over with my lifeboat for a nightcap sometimes. (gas can clatters) (sighs) (lighter clicks) Forgive me. (flames roaring and crackling) But I felt I needed to keep my boy out of trouble. Felt I owed it to him. And... She asked me. She made me promise. So you still wanna sit? - Hmm. Oh. (fraught guitar music) (seagulls cawing) - [Laura Voiceover] Fire. Can warm up cold days, can cook food for the hungry. But can it clean up sins? I had hoped it would clean everybody's sins. Mine. Theirs. But did it? Let me tell you my story. Although I wouldn't even know where to start.
