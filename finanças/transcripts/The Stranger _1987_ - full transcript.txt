Dr. Kite, the manager would like to talk to you. Drink? No, thank you. Your credit record with us has been good. Very good. You've paid your debts on time, every time. We appreciate that. I think you'll agree that $62,000 is a significant amount of money. Much more than what you used to borrow. So it's in our best interest to arrange our terms clearly before you leave Vegas. I understand. Can you pay us within the week then? Yes, of course. Two weeks. I think two weeks would be more realistic. Fine. We'll expect the $62,000 either by bank check or certified check within two weeks? Where's the safe? Where is it? Where's the girl? Now you're gonna tell me, huh? I don't know. Damn you, son of a bitch! Stop! Easy. You're gonna be fine. Relax. Lie down. Okay? You've had an accident. A serious one. You are lucky, though. You've got a concussion. But it could have been worse. You didn't get burned thanks to the Holstens, they were the family driving by when your car turned over. In just a few days you'll be able to go home. Where do you live? Hmm? Can you tell me your name? ...about the same for all of northern California. ...and reasonably cold nights. Cloudy enough overnight with brief periods of sunshine tomorrow. Enjoy the sunshine while you can because we're looking at some rain as early as Wednesday. And the rain will be with us off and on right through the end of the week. Temperature right now in Plainville, 53 degrees. Dr. Lou. Dr. Peter Lou. Respiratory therapy, please. Dr. Lou. Respiratory therapy, please. Hello. Sorry. Hello. How was Vegas? Well, you know Vegas. All bare asses and bare wallets. Yeah. And did you win? Did I win? Did I win? Of course I won. I always win. That's why I go back. Heh. Well, maybe you'll take me with you next time. I don't know, Anita. It's gonna be difficult. I've got a reputation to maintain. The girls in the chorus are very possessive, but I'll see what I can do. We've got something interesting for you. We do? What? See for yourself. Room 241. Dr. Rhea should be there right now. Let's do something this week. Like what? Like anything. Don't worry, my dear. You'll be all right. My hospital is brand-new, state of the art. Now, all we have to do is get you well. Now, do you feel up to trying to answer a few questions? Where do you live? Do you know your name? Can you remember anything about the house? I don't know anything. Just what I told you. About that night But these people you saw killed, were they your family? Did they seem familiar to you? They seemed familiar... Okay. You'd better rest now. Oh. And this disheveled gentlemen is Dr. Kite. You'll get to know him very well. Much better than you'd care to. This is right? She was thrown from a car? Mm-hm. So the concussion from the accident could have brought on the loss of memory. Unless it's an act of oppression. Dr. Elaine Jacobs, ICU, please. But if the amnesia is a defense mechanism, if it's hysterical, why isn't she repressing the violence that brought it on? A blow to the head, that gotta be it, right? Harris, I have decided to call in a specialist. Martin Hobby. Oh, no. Wait a minute, Klaus. He will be here in two or three days. I'm sure you've heard of him. We're talking about a once-in-a-lifetime case. You're gonna give it to somebody outside the hospital? Harris, this woman has amnesia. We're not equipped to treat that. You know, since I've been at this hospital, I've treated every rich brat and menopausal matron in California. Now something comes along with a little substance, you wanna give it- Give me a chance with this. Harris, I can't. I'm sorry. So you say you saw a man and a woman and a teenager shot to death by two men. One black, one white. Is that right? That's right. Look, miss, I don't know what you think you're doing, but you're not telling me the truth. We've done a lot of checking with the FBI and the state crime computers. Our own files too, we've checked over the past five years. Now, long story short is there is nothing anywhere about a crime like the one you say you saw. The one I saw? The one you saw. So you're sure that it happened the way you said? I'm positive. Now, don't you remember any details? No. Can't you remember the name of the street? No. What about the neighborhood? No. Well- I can't remember! Okay? I don't remember the name of the street or what the neighborhood looked like. Or if there was birds on the trees or crabgrass on the front lawn. I don't remember. What I told you is what I remember. Okay. Thanks for your help. Yeah, right. I want you to send a camera crew over here at the hospital. An exclusive? Hey, you're dreaming, my friend. I'd put her picture on every television screen and newspaper in California if I could. That's terrific. Thanks. Doctor, what is your experience with a patient like this? Her reliability? I mean, she's been hurt, right? And there's something's wrong with her. With her mind, I mean. Let me get this straight. Excuse me if I'm a little slow. You're gonna take a witness, possibly your only witness to a triple homicide, and put her face on television? Yeah. And the newspapers. Right out there for these killers to see? Well, why don't you put her face on the side of milk cartons while you're at it? Send out personalized invitations-? There's some risk, sure. But it may just turn up something. Someone who knows our Miss Doe. That's a chance we gotta take. What if it's a chance the patient doesn't wanna take? I can't go along with this, detective. Is this guy in charge of the hospital? Yeah, come in. This is a police matter, doctor. And I'm the police. Jay wants to talk to you. What's up? I've gotta get back to Miami. Ha! Jesus H. Christ. If she tells anybody about us, it's all over. And I mean all over. She probably hasn't. But what if she has? Look, I pay you for finished work. And finished work is what I want. She was never part of the deal. Now, I got a plane waiting. How much do you want? Forget it. I don't hit women. Let's just Get rid of her. I'll do it for you. I need to get back that information. And I need to know if she's told anyone about us. So how much? Let me whack her, man. Let's do it. And after I get what you want? Just make sure she's dead this time. Jeez. It's gonna cost you plenty. Women always bring trouble. You're crazy, you know that? We should just go in there and kill her, man. Diddle with her and get us all locked up. Look, you take care of your employees, I'll take care of the woman. Get lost, Rambo. Oh, yes. Oh. Don't you knock, doctor? I always knock doctors. I brought you some things to brighten your stay with us. I know the hospital smock is the ultimate in fashion. However, I thought you'd like something else for those less formal occasions. Anita helped me with the sizes, and the saleswoman at the store picked out the styles. So if these clothes aren't exactly you, don't blame me. Also, I got you some music. I don't know your taste, so I improvised. There's a little rock 'n' roll, some classical, some reggae, some classical, and I think some classical. Dr. Rhea is looking for you. All right, thank you. I'll see you later. Come on, I'm hungry. Clam chowder, that's all I want. Go get a job. Leave me alone. There was gas all over the hood of the car. Well, of course there was. The car turned over. Right. And exploded in soft dirt. What about that? You know what? I think you're right. How do you know I'm right? It's just a hunch. I could be completely wrong. Police work is like anything in life, Macaw. You live and you learn. That's all you can do. You live and learn. Maybe you're wrong. I don't think I'm not wrong. Get away from me! Get out of here. Get out of here! Hey! Okay! Who the hell do you think you are? You're just a bum. That's what you are, a bum! The whole damn town's full of bums! I'm sick of you! I'm getting out of this town! Her room! Her room! Police! Get out! Get out of the elevator! Hey, come on. Damn! Oh! Hey. Oh! Drop it or I'll blow your head off! Drop it! Macaw! Get Back! Yeah? What could I do? He wouldn't drop his gun. Any ID? Is she all right? Yes. Drs. Skyerose and Leedy... Now we know I'm not crazy. Good evening, Dr. Kite. Who are you? How did you get in here? I'd like to speak to you. About what? About your patient. The amnesiac. I've got some information you may be interested in. Sit down. Come on, sit down. Beautiful house you've got. I'll be completely up front with you, Dr. Kite. Your patient is a dangerous woman. Among other things, she's an extortionist and a thief. She's taken something from me that's something of great value. And I would like you to help me find it. I'm just a doctor. I'm not gonna get involved in this. Oh, come on. You already are involved in a sense. This, I believe, is yours. Sixty-two thousand dollars. Quite a lot of money to owe, wouldn't you say, doctor? I can always mortgage my house. You did, a year ago. You're broke. Completely broke. But don't worry. If you can find what I need by the end of the week, this will be yours. Your debt will be erased. And then you will have some very grateful friends in some very high places. What's her name? I can't tell you that. Why did you try to have her killed? I didn't. The man who was shot in the hospital, he was her partner. In more than a simple business sense. Eager to settle old scores. Comprende? I do. Great. And now, doctor, I would like to hear your answer. Take your time. I got all evening, doc. This feel familiar? Ever do this before? What, you think I'm crazy? No. I just wanted to know if you remembered maybe seeing a psychiatrist. You don't have to be crazy. Come on over to the desk. God, this is so... I feel so empty. I feel like I'm nobody. Like I have no identity. Just like looking in a mirror and there's nobody looking back at you. Close your eyes. Close your eyes. Tell me everything you remember that's on my desk. No peeking. Okay. There's a brass lamp and two white telephones. Um, a letter holder with lots of letters in it. And your Harris Kite, MD nameplate. And there's a plastic box, see-through. Plastic. With lots of little compartments inside. You have some colored pens in there, and a pair of yellow dice. And an ashtray. A lot of cigarette butts in it. You smoke too much. And a wooden box that I can't see into, so I don't know what's in there. And an ashtray. And some books. And an ashtray. And some magazines and an ashtray, and... Some file cards and an ashtray. How'd I do? Did I forget anything? No, you didn't forget anything. Keep your head down. Stay with the pen. Keep your eyes on the pen. It hurts. Try and close your eyelids. Once more. Keep your eyes up. Try and close your eyelids. All right, now just relax. Let's see if we can make a discovery. Follow the pen. Relax. Think back. Relax. Discovery? About your past. Just relax. I found something. I was in the airport. I think I must have worked there because... Excuse me. Yes, what is it? Last night, as I was leaving, a plane landed. I don't see it recorded here. That's because no plane landed. No, I saw it. No, no. There was no plane. Dr. Hobby? Yes? I'm your driver, sir. Oh, that's nice of them. I was expecting to take a cab. Well, they tried calling you in Vancouver, I believe. Not much chance of getting a message there, unless my cat answered the phone. Did you have a good flight? Well, a little bumpy. You know these small planes. Uh, how far is the hospital? Around 15 minutes. I've taken a shortcut. What is it? The axle, I think. I'd like to offer you a hand, but... You think you'll be able to fix it? I'll try. Let me take a look at it first. I can handle motors, but this is something else. I'm sure you'll manage, but how are you going to see? I've got a flashlight. Oh, that will help. Hold the flashlight. Sure. Ugh. You eat too much. You been up all night? One thing I know is she's not from around here. No one's coming forth to claim our Miss Doe and I don't think they will. On the other hand, our guys are somewhere within the television radius of this town. Say, 150 miles. You need this more than me. Let's forget about reported homicides. These guys are pros. Those bodies aren't gonna just pop up at us. What about a burnt-out house? A fire of suspicious origin? That's the way they try to pull this off. Now you're thinking. Morning, officer. Morning. * Is it all done With mirrors and lights? * * You say you love me * Maybe you might * Do I believe you? You all right? Turn it off. Can you hear me? Turn it off. The music? * When we touch... Turn it off! Okay. * How do I get closer-? Make a fist. Okay. Just relax. Just relax, take it easy. I want you to think back. Be calm. Don't fight. Just relax. Tell me everything you can remember. The way you used to live. What it was like. Was it a house? Was it an apartment? Just relax. Let go. Let go. Tell me what it was like. There was a man. A man. Who was he? Someone you knew? Someone you knew well? A friend maybe or-? It was a man, and he- And you just picked up and moved into this town? Just like that, without knowing a soul? I still don't know anybody in this town. Just the people I work with, that's it. You got courage. I'll say that. I'm just used to it. I'm going to ask you to help me with something. It's very simple, very safe. But it's something only you can do. Will you trust me in this? What did he ask you to do? I don't remember exactly. But I know I was searching. I was looking for something. Oh. Come on, come on, come on. Damn it. All right. In your story, in your apartment, this man, was he...? Was-? Did he seem dangerous? Did he have a-? Did he-? Was he carrying a gun? Did I say he had a gun? No. No, he didn't have a gun. All right, no gun. What did he look like? Anything. Features, coloring. Anything. He was dark. Very dark. Black? Black hair. Black man? No. Are you sure? How old was he? Was he middle-aged? What did he look like? Did he have short hair? Was he hard-looking? Wore glasses? What did he look like? He looked like you. Once. He got a divorce after five months. Guess I always think of psychiatrists as having gray hair and smoking a pipe. Okay. Okay, that was great. That was good. Has he been at this hospital a long time? A couple of years. Where's he from? Uh, East Coast somewhere. Are you two, uh...? Are, uh...? Well, you know we're not allowed to discuss our personal problems with our patients. What kind of underwear does he wear? He doesn't. Hello. I'm Dr. Hobby. Martin Hobby. Oh, yes. Hello, Dr. Hobby, we've been expecting you. You must be our star patient? And you're Anita Wren. Yes. We met several years ago. Oh. Really? Maybe when I was in school. Berkeley. Berkeley. Yes. Dr. Kite wanted you to call him as soon as you arrived. I know. I'll be seeing you. * You say you love me Maybe you might * Go get her! * Is all just like Or is it all * * Mirrors and lights? * When we touch My hand moves through you * * How do I get closer To you? * * Every day I'm holding someone new * * You know the feeling That you know * * All the scenes What I'm willing to show * * I'm inside But I can't recall * * What lies Underneath it all * Turn it off. Not yet. Keep going. * Is it all done... Keep going. Turn it off. We have find out who this person is. I can't. Yes, you can. Stay in that car. Tell me who it is. I don't want to. Yes, you do. You wanna see this person. You tell me who this person is. Please turn it off. Not until you see who this person is. Tell me who he is. What does he look like? No. Yes. No. Come on. No. Stay in the car. I won't. I- Yes, you will. Come on. I'm tired. "You have something of mine. I'm gonna kill you. I'm gonna kill you. Tell me who I am." I don't wanna do this anymore. Tell me who I am! Tell me who I am!" No! Yes! Stop! Keep going. All right. That's enough. Come on. Thank you. You're welcome. Well, you certainly seem to be on the right track with her. What's the prognosis? I don't know. I honestly don't know. Months? Weeks? Days? Not days. After the massacre outside her room, you'd have more luck winning the California lottery. I'm not saying treat her completely, of course. Yeah, of course. But we could try for some breakthrough, couldn't we? We can try. How do you like to proceed? Well, like I said. I think you're definitely on course. I think we can just stay with that. For a while anyway. Hmm. Honestly, I really don't know why Dr. Rhea even bothered to call me in on this. That's a compliment, doctor. I'm sorry. Thank you. What's the point? I agree with Dr. Hobby. It doesn't do her, us, or the hospital any good to keep her here. We're not running a hotel, after all. Discharging her would be dangerous. In what way? Somebody came in here, tried to put a bullet through her head. There's somebody else. This guy she keeps seeing, who's probably waiting to do the same thing. May I? I certainly understand your concern, doctor. That's why I suggested this private hospital up in San Francisco. Better equipped security-wise. Wait. Let's continue to treat her here as an outpatient. She's just about ready to identify this guy. A little more time, she's gonna crack wide open. If it doesn't happen soon, then we can go to this option. Well, that's a decision to Dr. Rhea has to make. I'll handle everything. I'll take care of her living arrangements. Well, I think it's a compromise we all can live with. Doctor? I can certainly live with that. You could have at least told me you were coming. What's this? It's your Bloody Mary. I'm out of tomato juice, so I used orange. Oh, thanks. I have a favor to ask. Ask away. Are you on the swing shift this week? Yes, again. How would you like a house guest? I'd be delighted. What made you change your mind? I thought you were in love with your solitude. I'm talking about the patient. They want to discharge her from the hospital. And you need a place to discharge her to. Sure. She's easy to care for. She doesn't eat much. Why not? Thank you. Harris, I'm going to tell you something I'm sure you don't want to hear. Don't tell me then. Yes, I will. One day you're going to wake up and your work with her will be a huge success, and you will suddenly find she's a total stranger to you. You have to know that. I know. So the image of this man keeps coming back to you, right? And you believe you were involved with him romantically. And what else? Nothing else. Is it? Uh-huh. Except, uh- Except what? Well, I... I feel kind of stupid. What? Heh. What? You wanna hear this? Uh-huh. You were killing people. Really? Oh. It's perfectly normal. You know, patients often have dreams about their doctors. Really? Yeah. Besides I'd never kill anybody. I became a psychiatrist because I hate the sight of blood. Sorry, doctor. Ready? Uh, Just about. Well, good day, ladies. Oh. Doctor. Hmm? Will I still be seeing you? How do you mean? After I'm discharged today, will you still be seeing me? Well, of course. You'll still be seeing me. Count on it. Where you going, Doris? Come back, Doris. What do you want, Doris? Gunshot, right? Oh, nice try. Knife through the heart, looks like. Any ID on the body? Yeah, all over. And I'm the Easter Bunny. A friend of yours? No. Okay, zipper up. See you back at the station. See anything upstream? I know him. You know him? Who is he? Clark. How do you know him? Was he a friend? Did you work with him? I don't know. Clark? What was his first name? Clark. What's his last name? I don't know. Last time you saw him? I don't know. You don't know. You don't know. You don't know, right? You don't know. You don't know who he is, you don't know when you last saw him. You don't know his last name, but you're sure he's Clark, right? What are you, kidding? Do I look stupid? Drake, come on. She said she doesn't know. Well, I heard she doesn't know. Can I make a suggestion, sarge? Why don't we just lay back? We lay back and then someone kills her. Then what? Can I talk to you for a minute alone, please? Maybe you're right. She's not crazy. She's not lying. A couple of days ago, a man came to see me. He wanted me to give him information about the patient. Who was he? He didn't say. He's about 50, uh, about 5-foot-7. Stocky build, wears glasses. He's got a a thick accent, he's carrying a gun. He knows her, and he knows the black guy was killed in the hospital. Why didn't you tell me this before? I lost $62,000 in Vegas. This guy bought my marker. You gamble? I gamble. What did he say about her? Anything we could use? No. No, nothing very much. Not even a name. What hotel? Royal Flush. Royal Flush. Macaw, I'm going. You stay with her. You know, doctor, for a smart guy, you did a very stupid thing. Were you living with him a long time? No. I don't even think I liked him very much. What he asked you to do, was it dangerous? I don't think it was dangerous. I mean, was it criminal? Illegal? No. No. But then I did something on my own. Things could get bad now. We gotta do something about this. I know, I know. There's going to be an investigation. They're going to send someone in to stick his nose where they think there's shit. And he's not going to introduce himself at the door. He's gonna be undercover. I know this for a fact from a friend. So? So this person they send will try to cut our balls off. Well, we'll cut his balls off first. That is why you hired me, right? Do you need anything? No. What was in it? What was in the bullet? I don't know. That's enough for now. I think you could use a rest. You're leaving? Yeah, I've got some work to do. I'd like to stay, but I gotta go home. Anita's gonna be here in the morning, She's gonna come right after the night shift. Everything's here for you. I have your number? You got the number. There's nothing to worry about. If you want anything from outside, I'm sure Macaw will be very helpful. Yeah, I'll be fine. Read a book. Have a good time. There's an idea. Maybe I read. Maybe you don't. My father used to say you always tell a person by the books they buy but don't read. That was 20 years ago and I still don't know what the hell he was talking about. Don't worry. Enjoy yourself. I'll see you tomorrow. Hold on. Hold on. Yeah. Hi. Where are you calling from, the hospital? No, I just left her. She's at the house Mm-hm. Maybe it's just a wild guess, but I think I know who killed that family. The family our patient saw. Everything fits. It can't be a coincidence. Yeah. Okay. Bye. Don't make me hurt you. I wanna know where it is. What? What'd you do with it? I don't know. Please, don't hurt me. I don't wanna hurt you. I just wanna know where the microfilm is. Huh? I don't know what you're talking about. I don't know. You're running out of time. What did you do with it? Let me think, okay? Okay. Just- Okay. I'll let you go. Don't be stupid. Now I'm gonna have to kill you. Help! Help! What happened? What are you doing out here? Where's Macaw? Where's Macaw? He had a knife. Macaw had a knife? In- There's somebody in the house? You're gonna be all right. Just relax. What happened? Somebody in the house. She said somebody broke in. Where have you been? I just went around the corner to get some doughnuts. Doughnuts? I don't give a fuck about your doughnuts! There's somebody in the house! Come on. He wants something from me. What is it? He thinks I have something he wants. What? Microfilm. Someone you know? Lights were out. What did he look like? It happened too fast. Did you recognize him? His voice. Who? Whose voice was it? Come on. Whose voice was it? Come on. Whose voice? Damn it, why can't I remember? I want you to see something. I think it's important. Two, please. * Is it all done With mirrors and lights? * Get down there. Come on, get down there. Yeah. Ha-ha-ha. Sit down! What about you, Daddy, huh? Please. You dumb or something, huh? Ha-ha-ha. I didn't hurt you! Ha-ha-ha. Where is it? Where's the safe? Where is it? Where's the girl. Oh, no. No, please. Please, please. Please, leave him alone. Something. I saw something. That night I was here. Say it. I was here. Say it. You're not at home watching TV. Shh. I saw something. What? What? It was here. That night I was here, I saw something. They came after me. * Show me How to break the seal * * Is it all done With mirrors and lights? * * You say you love me... Where is it? * Is all just like Or is it all * Where is it? Where's the girl? Oh, no. Son of a bitch. Oh, no. Please. Please, please. Leave him alone. No. Don't. Come with me, kid. No, please. No, no. Right. Thanks. No matter what, just stay here. Now you're gonna tell me, huh? You hear? If anything happens to me, run in the opposite direction. It doesn't concern you. I'll take care of it. You know too much already. No. No? No? No? Go get her! All right, where is it, sucker? Huh? We know she gave it to you. Now, where is it? Enough. Give me that. Maybe she still got it. Dump him in the river. Get the car! It can't be Hobby. It can't be Dr. Hobby. This is madness. You must be substituting Hobby for somebody- And it can't be Hobby. What was in the microfilm? Names of drug dealers. And who's Clark? What does he- Who's Clark? Drug Enforcement. Come on, let's go. We've gotta get out of here. Jay. It's the name of the guy who owned the airport. We'll talk about it later. They're using the airport to bring in- Interesting story, huh, doc.? Well, you proved you're a good shrink. Now, let's see how good a surgeon you are. Hmm? Go. Move it. Cuff them. I'll get the door. Oh, boy, this guy weighs a ton. Oh, they get lighter when you start cutting them up. Oh, yeah? Yeah, they do. They let off some kind of heavy gas when you start slicing. Shh. Get ready. Everything all right? You think these'll do? Macaw. Macaw, come on, this is crazy. You're not gonna get away with this. Drake's gonna find out. No, he won't. And you're not gonna be around to tell him. Alice. My name is Alice. Alice what? Kildee. Alice Kildee. Shut up! In there. Call when you get it. I was looking forward to seeing you again, Dr. Kite. And you, Alice. Get over there. Why did you cuff them? They were getting restless. Why, doc? You said you were going to help me. Don't you want your marker back? Sure you do. It's a very high fee for a surgeon. But I'm a very generous man. Go ahead, doc, slice him up. Where? What do you mean where? I mean, where? Where do you want me to look for the microfilm? Is it in his stomach? In his guts? Is it a little bit further below? I mean, where is it? Where? It all depends on his digestion. Oh. How soon after he swallowed the microfilm did you kill him? Forget it. Oh, God! What? I'm gonna puke. I need more light. Give him more light. Ugh. What happened? Oh, Christ. Leave him. Let's get this thing over with. Aah! Hey, you don't need us. We're nobody, man. We don't know who you are. Nobody does. Jay's dead. We don't- Oh, God. What happened? You're asking me? I thought this was your case. Stiffs are inside. Two more this time. Who did it? The doctor and his patient. What happened? Is he dead? I'm okay. I'm okay. They were gonna kill us. Who's they? Dr. Hobby and Jay. Dr. Hobby? He wasn't a doctor. Jay? Jay who? Palamo. The guy I told you about in the morgue. He owned the airport where I worked. He was a drug smuggler. You got your memory back. Where's the house? What house? Where they killed the family? Oh. Don't tell me you don't know. There's no family. It was a movie. Movie? We were watching a movie when they killed Clark. Clark? Clark Whistler, He was a narcotics agent. They wanted the microfilm. You mean the movie? She mea- She means the microfilm. He swallowed it. Where's Macaw? Maybe he can tell me what you're talking about. Did they get him? We did. What? We had to. He was one of them. That's why Macaw wanted you to lay back on the case. Gotta go, sarge. Okay, don't go, lady. I wanna talk to you. I'm going with him. Okay. But you wait for me in the hospital. You stick around till I get there. You okay? Are you sure? Yeah. Are you sure you're gonna be all right? You're not lying to me? No. How are you? I'm fine. What are you gonna do now? What do you mean? I mean, where are you gonna go? I can't go anywhere. Why? The cop said I have to stick around. Well, as soon as you're finished telling him everything you know, you can take off. I guess I'm gonna have to stay then. How come? I think my amnesia's coming back. I can't remember a thing. I'm a blank. You know a good shrink, might be able to help me? I don't believe in them. Oh.
