[ZED] Welcome back to Seabrook. [ADDISON] We started off as a perfectly planned community full of cheer. - [ZED] Then zombies showed up. - [SCREAMING] [ADDISON] And then werewolves. [ZED] So, naturally, well, supernaturally, we had some bumps along the way. [CHATTERING] But now, we've all learned to live together, united. [SCHOOL BELL RINGS] [ADDISON] Seabrook is becoming a perfect place. [ZED] Well, almost. Monsters still have one big barrier to break through, like getting into college. [ADDISON] But if we win the championship football game tonight, we're going to have our first zombie recruited to college. [ZED] And the doors to higher ed will be open to all monsters. - [CROWD CHEERING] - [ADDISON] And then we'll all be together. [ZED] And maybe, in college, one special girl with white hair won't stand out. [ADDISON] And maybe she'll even find a place where she belongs. [ZED] So win tonight's football game, and everything in Seabrook will be perfect. [ADDISON] So we can't let anything get in our way. Hey, happy-very-go-lucky Zombie Zed here. In Seabrook, humans, zombies, and werewolves are on the same team. Hey, what up, dude? [PLAYER] Yeah, Zed. - [LAUGHING] Hey, Zed. - Yo. - Thanks to you, I'm a brand-new man. - Yes. No more going to the mall in pajama pants. - Yeah. - And no more living in my mom's basement. - Thank you, Zed! - [CHEERING] Hi, Mom! I am so pumped for tonight's championship game. I prepared a victory dance. - You wanna see it? - Absolutely. [SCATTING] All right. Poppin' and lockin'. Okay. Tonight's game is really important, Coach. So I scripted all of our plays. Oh, thank you so much, Zed. - This is gonna help us a lot. - I got you. Thank you. See you. [ZED GRUNTING] [Z-BAND BEEPING, POWERING UP] [GROWLS, ROARS] Hit! [GRUNTS] - Hey! - [CHEERING] [LAUGHING] All right, all right, all right, we gotta keep our energy up tonight, boys. Peanut butter for you, bone and beef for you, and blended brains for me. You have to win this football game tonight, Zed. Win tonight, and you'll be the first zombie to ever attend college. I will. Don't worry. My little sister, Zoey. Zombie-kind's depending on you, so we can all go to college. No pressure. My hacktivist best friend, Eliza. She's interning at Z-Corp, maker of the Z-Band. Yeah, I know. My zom-girl's breaking the glass ceiling. Literally. I broke the glass ceiling today testing a prototype. I am so getting recruited to Mountain College. This is gonna be a small step for zombies everywhere, and a giant step for me, because... Hi, I'm Addison. And as cheer captain, it's my duty to support Seabrook. But this is personal. I'm going to Mountain College, and I really need Zed to win tonight's game and join me. So let's cheer our team to victory. - [WHISTLE BLOWS] - [CHEERLEADERS] Five, six, seven, eight...

[SIGHS] Aw! - When I say Sea, you say Brook. Sea. - [ALL] Brook. - Sea. - [ALL] Brook. [CHATTERING] [MOONSTONES TRILLING] Our moonstones are acting weird, Wyatt. Something big is happening. Something big is happening. Biggest football game in the universe. Just the biggest in Seabrook. - [MOONSTONE TRILLING] - [GROWLS] Come on. You know how important a win is for all us monsters. Seabrook needs you, cheer wolf. You want a fierce werewolf leader to rally a football team? Come on. [HOWLING] Let's tear these Eastside Eels apart. Destroy them! Yeah! [ALL CHEERING] [SCRAPING] Maybe just a bit too much school spirit. Get our Mighty Shrimp on this bus so we can defend our turf. No outsiders mess with our pack. Yeah! [ALL CHEERING] Whoo, whoo!

Okay, everyone, let's give it up for our football team as they head off to victory. Here they come! - [ALL CHEERING] - [LAUGHS] Ha! Thank you, thank you for coming to see me off for my big game. You're not even on the football team, Bucky. Um, that's President Bucky. And as president, all accomplishments are my accomplishments. It's gonna be a banner year for me, now that I've organized the... National Cheer Off? Addison organized the Cheer Off. She invited squads from all over to compete. Oh! Ah! [GIGGLES] Go, Seabrook! Hey, Seabrook! Seabrook! Go, go, go, go! Go, boys! [LAUGHS] Whoo! Let's go. Hey, hey. You are going to kill it out there tonight, okay? Those Eels think that they can keep you caged up. They think they can keep you on a leash. But you are no cuddly puppy. You are a fierce beast of the forest! [BOTH HOWLING] - This shrimp be cray! - So cray! Go, Wynter. - [SCREAMING] - Whoo! [GRUNTS] Ooh! Ah! Too much? Never too much. You do you. [ALL CHEERING] [CHANTING] Seabrook, Seabrook, Seabrook. Seabrook, Seabrook. Hey, check out the recruiter from Mountain College. He looks nervous. Well, he's never seen monsters before. But he's gotta recruit my boy, right? Oh, I'm... I'm sure he will. I mean, keep calm and zombie on, right? - [LAUGHS] - Yeah. Yeah, right. I'm telling you, Zed Necrodopolis is a star. Well, maybe on the football field, but do we really want a monster in our classroom? - [WEREWOLF GROWLS] - [GASPS] Zombies and werewolves? Oh, my. It'll be fine. - Whoo! - [RECRUITER] Come on. Hey, I'm Zed's dad. Nice to meet you. We are so excited to meet you. This is it. - Together... - Forever. [THUNDERCLAP] Meteors. Since the werewolves recovered the moonstone, meteor showers have been pretty regular. - It's so Seabrook. - [THUNDERCLAP] Come on! [ZEVON] Oh! Here he is now. Oh, hi. I'm a recruiter from Mountain College... [THUNDERCLAP] - ...and we need... we need... - [THUNDERCLAP] You need to recruit me to Mountain College, or... [LAUGHS] Oh, no. Oh, no! [THUNDERCLAP] What?

For centuries, we have been without a home, but I found utopia. The perfect new planet for our people. I hid the coordinates in the most precious thing in Seabrook. [THUNDERCLAP] Instrumomo. You must find the most precious thing in Seabrook. Find the most precious thing... precious thing... precious thing in Seabrook. The file is corrupted. We need to find their most precious thing.

Enough! Oops. It seems our arrival may have caused a small, somewhat destructive energy surge. It appears these angry beings may not give us their most precious thing willingly. Then we'll have to explain our presence without telling them our mission. Oh! Huh. I'm thinking what you're thinking. Take us to your leader. Your cheerleader. - [STAMMERS] - No. Hi. We accept your invitation to the National Cheer Off. [THUNDERCLAP] Z-Patrol, arrest them! [AGENT 1] Yes, sir! - [AGENT 2] Let's go! - [AGENT 3] Move in! Move in! [AGENT 4] Hold right there! [DALE] Great idea separating the aliens, Principal Lee. Not my first time dealing with spacey teens. [CHUCKLES] They're probably here to clone me to create an unstoppable cheer force. I mean, who wouldn't want more me? Well, they're uninvited and have to leave. But we invited everyone to our Cheer Off to compete for the Seabrook Cup. Um... You can't just give away my bling. I don't intend to lose. And I always believed that cheer could bring people together. Maybe even worlds together. Or tear our worlds apart. Mark my words, these aliens are here to take what's ours. - [SCREAMS] - Okay. [SIGHS] Greetings. Did you want me to continue waiting alone? - Uh, I think that would be... - That's... I could... Yes. - Yes. - ...best, yes. Very well. Shall I redon your ceremonial jewelry and rewire your door panel? - That would be dynamite. Yeah. - Ridic... Yes, please. Oh! May you find harmony. [SIGHS] [SPEAKS ZOMBIE] Bonzo, let's not deal with the alien invasion right now. I'm kind of in an impossible situation. I understand. To get here, we developed interstellar flight, defeated space squids, traversed a carnivorous black hole, twice. Uh, okay, not that impossible. Because of you, I can't get into Mountain College. The recruiter quit, and zombies can't apply. - Zah. - Hmm. [BOTH SCREAM] Mountain College. Downloading. [BEEPING] [ZED] What are they doing? [BEEPS, POWERS DOWN] Too bad you are not exceptional. The only way for you to get in is to prove that you are exceptional. Mountain College has a separate application for an exceptional-student scholarship and it does not specifically prohibit zombies. [SPEAKING ZOMBIE] Yeah. [SPEAKS ZOMBIE] That sounds exactly like me. [CHUCKLES] Perhaps exceptional means something else in this galaxy. Ah, okay, you know what? Believe me, I'm impressive. Kay? Meh. I do not see it. Whatever. I am going to get that scholarship to Mountain College and knock down the door to higher education for all monsters. Yeah. [BOTH SPEAKING ZOMBIE] [GRUNTING, SCREAMING] - [LAUGHING] - Why are you so agitated? Oh, we are not agitated. We are happy. You found a loophole. A way this zombie can get into college. Come on. [CHUCKLES] All right. Oh. Emotions are messy for telepaths, so we suppress them. - But they do seem interesting. - [KNOCKING] You can all come on out. [WALKIE-TALKIE CHATTER, INDISTINCT] [A-LI] We have many advancements to share with your primitive people. We even created a digestible bacterial fermentation of lactose at sub-zero stasis. Whoa. Froyo? Yeah, we got that too. Impressive. If you're here to invade Seabrook, our pack won't go down without a fight. We do not want your one-star planet. They are so emotional. [GASPS] Yes, but when in Seabrook, I'm going to disengage our emotional suppressors. Personally, I'm excited to see what emotions feel like. [BEEPS] Excited! [STAMMERS] That's an emotion. It feels so exciting. We've decided to let you stay until after the cheer competition, but not a day later. Thank you, Mayor. We are honored to join your cheer competition. What is cheer? Oh, don't worry. I'll show you later. Also, what is competition? When you challenge others to prove you're the best. No, we are a harmonious people. We do not compete amongst ourselves. Although, that is an intriguing concept, is it not? Hi, I'm Zed. Zombie, football star. Generally well-liked. Well, I am A-lan. Extraterrestrial. Hey, the haters say I'm a little extra too. [CHUCKLES] - Oh, competition. - No, it's just a handshake. - [ELECTRICITY CRACKLING] - [GRUNTING] Okay. [GROANS] [GROANS] [SIGHS] - Did I win? - No, you did not win. Apologies. Our people have a special stardust spark. That some lesser species may find painful. [GROWLS] Welcome to Seabrook. - Hmm. - Hi. [MOTHERSHIP] A-lan, did you remember your midday rations? Yes, Mothership. A-li, did you remember your thermal overgarment? Yes, Mothership. And, A-spen, don't forget your mission to find the interstellar map to our new home planet. Mothership. Shh. Secret mission. Okay. No need to bite your mothership's head off. [GIGGLES] I hope you take this opportunity to learn from our advanced intelligence. [GRUNTING] Uh, you have to pull. Yeah. There you go. [CHUCKLES] [GIGGLES] [MUMBLES] [ZED] Yo. - [BELL RINGING] - [ADDISON] Hi. Aren't the aliens amazing? They have a non-hierarchical approach to leadership. They're a fashion-forward, peaceful people. Okay, well, they did kind of blow up Seabrook, right? Well, it was an accident, Zed. I mean, just imagine the courage needed to come to a new planet. I mean, I'm just nervous about going away to college alone. Well, not alone. - With you. - Right. I am so getting into Mountain College, and we are going to be together forever.

What just happened? [CHATTERING] Addison, you can't help those invaders. Back off, Bucky. Your cousin's the cheer captain now. Not you. Thanks, Willa. But Bucky is right. I'm right? Yes, of course I'm right. A little right. I don't trust the aliens, Addison. Last time outsiders swooped into Seabrook, our moonstone was stolen. And this time, we might lose our shot of getting into Mountain College. Which is why we need to protect what's ours. The Seabrook Cup, my legacy. Me, in general. Right, Willa? Or should I say, Wacey? You should not. - [GROWLS] - [SCREAMS] Don't worry about the aliens. I'm not afraid of a little competition. [ZED] I have a real shot of getting into Mountain College. I just... I wish you were here to help me with the exceptional student application. [ELIZA] I am here. Turn around. I whipped up a little something with the spare parts laying around Z-Corp. This is amazing, Eliza. [SPEAKS ZOMBIE, SCOFFS] [SPEAKING ZOMBIE] No, the aliens didn't imprison me in this robot body. I did this. [SPEAKING ZOMBIE] Yeah, I would have made myself taller too. [CHUCKLES] At least I didn't fail my driver's test, Bonzo. Twice. [SPEAKING ZOMBIE] [ELIZA] Sorry, low blow. You're a genius. Uh, when's your application due? Uh, today, so not technically last-minute? [ELIZA] Okay, let me get this straight. The only way you can get in is as an exceptional student? Uh... [ELIZA] Okay, hold on. Let me pull up your transcript. [TYPING] [COMPUTER BEEPING] Hey, check it out. I'm ranked third in our class for grade point average. [CHUCKLES, SPEAKS ZOMBIE] [BEEPING] [SPEAKING ZOMBIE] What? I'm ninth now? - No, that... that's wrong. - [BEEPING] [ZED] I'm ranked 18th? Wait, okay, this doesn't make sense at all. All these grades ahead of me are... otherworldly. [MS. LEE] Zed. [WHISTLES] They did the entire course in 23 minutes. It only took them that long because they couldn't figure out how to work a pencil sharpener. [SCREAMS] - [CHATTERING] - [SCREAMS] Look, the utensil is functional again. The aliens stole all my class rankings. - [SPEAKING ZOMBIE] - And beat my athletic records. What? Hey! Oowee, Zed, A-lan just obliterated your best times. He ran crop circles around you. Bench press records, blew yours away. High jump, he's a VFO. Very Identifiable Flying Object. He has six-pack abs. I can get to eight, Coach. Just give me time. [ALL LAUGHING] And the best part? The laws of gravity do not apply to them. - [BEEPING] - Whoa! I'd be happy to dunk on you, Zed. [CHUCKLING] That'd be fun to see. [ELIZA] Well, there goes your chance. Now monsters will never get in. [SIGHS] Yes, being better than others is very enjoyable. Hey, aliens. You are ruining my chances to get into Mountain College. Oh! I do not like this conflict. Cannot wait to leave this discord. Yeah, okay, so then why don't you just go back to your own planet? Because it was destroyed. We don't have a home. - [CRYING] - Uh... I... I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. I really am. You know, as tough as things have been for zombies, we've always had Zombietown. [SIGHS] Is there anything I can do? You would help us? [SCOFFS] [A-LI] With our Luma Lenses, we probed all the minds of Seabrook. Mind probes? Why would you do that? - To learn about cheer, obviously. Cheer. - Cheer, obviously. Cheer. Okay, but what about people's privacy? I mean, you can't just scan people's... Hey, what is that? - Oh, your biology teacher's brain scan. - Is that my test? A D-plus? [GROANS] That is... Ouch. I could beat that easily. You were unfairly marked. Your answers correctly highlight the purpose of brains for zombies. Your teacher does not understand zombie culture. [BEEPING] [A-LAN] That's the grade you should have gotten. - Yes! Just like that? Thank you. - Mm-hmm. [A-LAN] Mm-hmm. So there is something you can do for us. [BEEPING] This image appears in many scans. What is it? That is the moonstone. It is the most precious thing in Seabrook. It's the life force for werewolves. [ALL] Instrumomo. But stay away from it, because the werewolves won't let any outsiders near the moonstone. - You are so caring. - [GROANS] Okay, well... Zed, we shall reward your help by improving your application. It's not rocket science, but knowing rocket science won't hurt. [CHUCKLES] What does that expression mean? It means that the universe has sent me an intergalactic alien dream team to help get this zombie into college! Yeah. Okay. [SIGHS] This looks really good. How'd you get the application done so fast? I got friends in high places, what can I say? [ELIZA] This is huge. Zed, you did it. Oh, yeah. And all I have left is the home interview for Mountain College. Zombie-kind is depending on you. Yeah, it's all on me. [SPEAKS ZOMBIE] Hey, don't worry, man. I got this. [BOTH GROWL] Eliza, is that you? Cool, right? You know, can't beat zombie tech. Well, I mean, I wouldn't underestimate wolf tech. Hey, I was thinking, um, maybe we could have like, like a, you know, remote study date or... [MOONSTONE TRILLING] Oops. [POWERS DOWN] Zed? ♪ Come over here Let me talk to ya ♪ Come on, Eely. We gotta get to practice. ♪ Through the ups and downs Stand by me ♪ ♪ When people look They know It's meant to be ♪ [CHEERLEADER] Eely, come on.

Yeah, of course. [A-SPEN] I have a feeling I cannot define. My palms are sweaty, and it feels like space moths are in my stomach. Space flu. I think you have a crush, A-spen. Crush? No, um, it's when you like-like someone. You know, love. I do not know. It's when you connect with someone in a really strong way. And desire, somewhat irrationally, to be with them? - Yes, that is it. - [GASPS] Who's the lucky person? A zombie. Oh! Bonzo is so not available. Hey, hold my glasses, Addy. - I love Zed. - [BOTH GASP] Uh, you love Zed? Uh, A-spen, um, I love Zed. Aw. That's so cute. We both love Zed. How wonderful. Yeah, you can't like her boyfriend. One must control who they love? Mm-hmm. Uh, well, no. You can't control love. But Zed and I are a couple, and we wanna be together for... Forever? Well, if he gets into Mountain College then, yeah, forever. Or maybe he will not get in, change his mind, and love me when you go away. [GASPS] [ADDISON] Uh... [CHUCKLES] Yeah, um, let's talk about this after practice. Practice. Sounds fun. Yeah, and we'll show you why the Mighty Shrimp are the best cheerleaders in the galaxy. [ELECTRONIC MUSIC PLAYING] ♪ Utopia ♪ Huh. [CHUCKLES] ♪ Utopia ♪ ♪ Utopia ♪ ♪ Utopia ♪ - [ECHOING] - [MUSIC ENDS] [APPLAUSE] Our telepathic groupthink makes cheer so easy. Yes. We are even better than you, and you've practiced your whole life. - [GASPS] - Huh? So fun. Thank you for inviting us. Hey, it's us against them, and we are going to win. We're not gonna let them take what's ours. Like the Seabrook Cup. Right, the Seabrook Cup. [ALL] Go, Seabrook! - Yes. That's the spirit. - [GIGGLES] See? Your squad just needed a common enemy to motivate you. No. [SIGHS] We are going to win because this squad loves each other, not because we hate anyone else. It's not who we are. This Cheer Off is our last chance to cheer together, and to win it, we have to try a triple hip-hop double tuck Lindy. [STACEY] That move's impossible. I can't do that move without face-planting. - His face cannot take another nose job. - [GASPS] Together, we can do anything. Come on, guys. Let's go. Now that they're distracted, - we can vaporize them. - [A-SPEN, A-LAN] See the moonstone. Don't look at me like that. A-li, we are a peaceful people. Right, sorry. These emotions are getting to me. Oh, me too. The joy of competition has consumed me, and, unfortunately, I am just so good at winning. We must remember, we are one people. - United. - Without disagreement. [ALL] And we need to find the moonstone. [DOORBELL RINGS] [SNIFFS] [POWERING UP] [SIGHS] Now they'll never know we were here. [GRUNTS] There's a force field around it, which I most definitely saw. [BEEPING] - Not anymore. - Most impressive. Yes, the moonstone's crystal formation would have the processing power to hold our map's coordinates. I meant their frozen yogurt's impressive. Sorry. The scan's complete. And the coordinates are... Not hidden here. [SIGHS] Mission failure. - [ELECTRICITY CRACKLING] - [GRUNTING] [SIGHS] Didn't hurt that bad. Owie-momo... This stone interferes with our stardust. It's very powerful. Someone's coming. Mothership, beam us up, now. "Mothership, beam us up, do our laundry, calculate the trans-temporal quantum jump."

[MOTHERSHIP] Well, since you said please. [BEEPING] [MOTHERSHIP] Uh, hello? You're welcome. [LAUGHING] [BREE] Way to bring it, everybody. Uh... Help! Help! What is going on? Whoa. [CHUCKLES] Ha, missed me... [GRUNTS] - Sorry, reflexes. Zed! - [GROANS] What are you doing here? I got beamed up. What are you doing here? A-spen asked if I could help with my knowledge of Seabrook. Aw... Poor thing. They're trying to spend alone time with you. Alone time? Why? Oh! Oh. Okay, well, I do have universal appeal. Hey, be nice. A-spen's new to feelings and human relations. [A-SPEN] Beware. Intruder. Addison? Mothership beamed you aboard? Mm-hmm. We have no choice but to... - Vaporize you. - Welcome you. - A-li. - Oh! Right. Welcome you. Sorry. [ON COMPUTER] This is Scout Commander... You have a wonderful home. I proudly report my mission... It is a marvelous ship, but it is not our home. Our planet was destroyed by environmental blight built up over many years. What? Over years? Didn't anyone try to stop it? No. And we lost everything. No one spoke up. That would have led to disagreements. We value harmony. And we will remain one people in harmony at any cost. You seem angry. [CHUCKLES] I'm not angry. I'm just in harmony in a super hostile way. I need to get off this planet. [DISTORTED VOICE ON COMPUTER, INDISTINCT] We need your help. But first... A-spen has great feelings for you. Ah, right. About that. I've been doing research, Zed. Couples can grow apart. But we are not a couple. No, we are not. I am breaking up with you. I am sorry. We do not have tissues aboard, but you can use my sleeve if you must cry. What? We'll always have the invasion. As you can see, they have mastered the interactions of your species and feels you can both be trusted. Years ago, our scout crashed in Seabrook and hid a map to Utopia. A new home for aliens. We came here to find it. Wait, I thought you said you were here for cheer. That was a deception. [SIGHS] We were afraid you would not allow us to find the map since it's hidden in the most precious thing in Seabrook. So that's why you kept asking about the moonstone. Yes. But our scans came back negative. It's not there. What else is precious in Seabrook? Well, cheer, mostly. But you can't hide coordinates in a routine. [ON COMPUTER] This is Scout Commander... Do not touch. We're repairing the files of our scout's logs. With no success. I mean, have you guys tried banging it? It works whenever my old TV's on the fritz. [CHUCKLES] Banging? That's highly sensitive cosmic tech. - You can't just bang it. - Ouch! Oh. That seems to have worked. [ELECTRONIC VOICE] Playing Scout's log. [ON COMPUTER] This is Scout Commander 15-09. I proudly report my mission is complete. For centuries, we have been without a home, but I found utopia. The perfect new planet for our people. I hid the coordinates in the most precious thing in Seabrook. You must find the most precious thing in Seabrook. Many decades ago, out of fuel, my scout ship crashed on this planet. I would have died if not for a young humanoid, Eli. He hid me and nursed me to health. But with no ship to take me home, I was forced to hide my true identity. I know how that feels. I joined Eli in his school, and I discovered my passion: Cheerleading. I even created a trophy. [GASPS] The Seabrook Cup. But no longer in contact with our people, my hair grew white, and I lost my stardust powers. Though I gained something else. A family. Eli and I fell in love and married, and we named our firstborn A-Mishanta, but we always called her Missy. [GASPS] That's my mom's name. Grandma? [STATIC] The alien scout was your grandma! My grandma. Grandma Angie was an alien? My mom's an alien? You're part alien. That's why the ship beamed you up too. Zed, I know who I am! [LAUGHING] [GASPS] We have too much history, Zed. Okay. We found this Luma Lens on the scout ship. It belonged to your grandmother. [SIGHS] Now do you possess our spark? Can you lift the Luma Lens? Uh, I... I can't. Our relationship with stardust defines us. Our technology would not work for you. You cannot share in our telepathy. Nor survive travel with us. No, no, this is who I am. This is where I belong. It all makes sense. I'm sorry. You do not have our spark. You are not truly one of us. [SIGHS] Right. Yeah. Sorry. - Addison. - [FOOTSTEPS DEPARTING] I feel deep sorrow. Wait. The scout's trophy contains materials from our planet. What could be more precious than an artifact from our home world? [CHUCKLES] The map is there. We must win that trophy. The aliens won't accept me? I may be part alien, but I'm still totally alone. Addison, because of you, no one in Seabrook ever has to feel alone. You made this a place for people to call home. [SIGHS] I'll still help the aliens find the map to their new home. Good. And whatever happens, you have to go to Mountain College whether I get in or not. It doesn't matter how far away we are from each other. We will always be together. You'll do great on your interview tomorrow. I better. Everyone's counting on me to be the first zombie to go to college. You're not alone either, Zed. Come on. [CRICKETS CHIRPING] [CHUCKLES] [ADDISON] Where did you hide the map, Grandma? [KNOCKING] Mom, where was Grandma Angie from? Seabrook, dear. Born and raised. Why? Because, uh... Never mind. - Good night. - Night. - [CHATTERING] - [ELIZA] Attention, everyone. If Zed can prove that monsters are exceptional, doors will open for all of us. You're gonna ace your driver's test, zom-boo. But right now, focus. Zed needs us. All right, everybody. Listen up. We only get one shot. Zed's interviewer, Mrs. Crabtree, is gonna be here in an hour. [SPEAKING ZOMBIE] Who's early? Uh-oh. Seabrook, we have a problem. You're making history today, Zed.

Well, I'm just doing my zom-best. [CHUCKLES] Zombie best. Uh, our biggest concern is that you could turn into a monster at any time. Yes. I am a monster, but completely safe. Zombies eating brains?

Farewell sweet bling. Ooh! What do we have here? What do we have here? What do we have here? What do we have here? What do we have here? What do we have here? [ANNOUNCER] It's been an exciting evening here at the National Cheer Off. We discovered alien life this week, - but the big question in the universe... - Let's go! ...is who will win the Seabrook Cheer Cup? - [CROWD CHEERING] - Yeah! Okay! [ANNOUNCER] Oh, the Eastside Eels are really bringing it! Now, remember. This priceless thingy is mine! So tell me what it is! Now! Now! Now! So catty. Clearly not raised by wolves. I bet I'm the first intern to ever hack alien tech. [COMPUTER BEEPING] It's a firewall. Let me try my moonstone. [MOONSTONE TRILLING] It worked. It's a mind probe. [COMPUTER BEEPING] Uh... Bloodthirsty monsters. Always winning! Look at all those people thinking of me! That's just your mind scan, Bucky. [COMPUTER BEEPING] [CATS MEOWING] Aw, Wynter. You like cat videos. Everyone likes kittens. [COMPUTER BEEPING] We'd be honored. [GROWLING] Wyatt? Why does your mind probe have so many memories of me? You have a crush on me? Uh... I, uh... [GASPING] [WILLA] Enough with this mushy stuff! Find out what the aliens are up to. [TYPING] [COMPUTER BEEPING] This is Scout Commander. You must find the most precious thing in Seabrook. - The aliens lied about their mission! - What? [WILLA] We knew they were shady all along. Who knows what else they're lying to us about? Bucky, alert the Z-Patrol. Help! Help! Z-Patrol! We need help! - [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] - [CHEERING] The Eels look eel-ectric as they try to slither their way to victory. And that excites me. Me too. Me three. [CROWD CHEERING] - Whoo! - [PHONE RINGING] Hello, this is Zed Necrodopolis. - Yes? I gotta take this. I love you. - Okay. Yes. This is he. This is I. This is Zed Necrodopolis. Really? Okay. Wow! All right. Well, thank you so much. All right. Bye-bye. [EXCLAIMS] I just got accepted into Mountain College! They're even inviting other monsters to apply. We are breaking down barriers, people. [SIGHS] - I've gotta tell Addison. - [SIRENS WAILING] Seal the cheer pavilion perimeter. If aliens are here, we'll root 'em out. Move it! I gotta warn the aliens. [CROWD CHEERING] Whoo! Up next, a team not afraid to get astrophysical. From out of this world, give it up for the aliens! [CROWD CHEERING] - Stop! Do not go out there! - [GASPS] But we need to win the cheer cup! Our future depends on it. And winning tastes so good, Zed. Z-Patrol is looking for you. They are not gonna let you compete. But without our map, we'll forever wander the galaxy without a home. Well, you better hope Addison sticks her landing and wins it for ya. [CROWD CHEERING, CLAMORING] Let's go! [CHATTERING] Our extra-talented extraterrestrials are not taking the stage. [SIGHS] And on this planet, that means the aliens are disqualified. [CROWD GROANS] They're disqualified? Now it's up to me to get the map! So instead, next up is our final team, - Seabrook's Mighty Shrimp! - [ALL CHEERING] [BREE] Addison! We have to win the Seabrook Cup!

Enough! This is your fault too, Addison. You let these aliens in, and they lied to us. They betrayed us. You betrayed us! - So you're either with us, or... - With them? But I am them, Willa. I may be from Seabrook, but my grandma wasn't. I am... an alien! - [PERSON 1] What? - [PERSON 2] What? - [PERSON 3] No way! - [PERSON 4] No way! - [PERSON 5] Wow! - [SIGHS] [GASPS] Addison is one of us! And she's amazing! Mom, Grandma Angie was an alien. But that's impossible. Missy, tell her it's impossible. Dale, I'm so sorry. I know, sweetie. I've always known. You lied to me? My parents thought that hiding was the best way to protect me. And you. Grandma always called you her most precious thing. Wait. She said I was her what? No. No, no. The coordinates are not here. This is not the map. That's because the map isn't a what. It's a who. [BEEPING] [GASPS] Addison is our map. - The coordinates are in her DNA. - [BOTH] Instrumomo! You're the Scout's... [GRUNTS] Your grandmother's most precious thing! Yes! We found the map! - [ELECTRICITY CRACKLING] - [GRUNTS] - [ADDISON] Sorry! - Yeah! Okay! Let's figure that out later. - Yeah. - But this is great! Now, you guys can record your coordinates and head back home. And Addison and I are headed to Mountain College together! I got in. That's great, Zed! - Nah. - [ADDISON] Yeah. [CHUCKLES] [A-LI] But the map to utopia is dynamic. Constantly computing new units to guide our spaceship. It's not just some numbers. And since Addison is our map... She needs to come with us. - What? - No. No! You cannot take Addison. These are my people, Zed. They need me to survive. [GASPS] When the aliens leave, I'm going with them. [CROWD MURMURING] This is the hardest decision I've ever made, but I have to do what's right. Addison, there's something I have to share with you. I should've done this years ago. I just wish I was as strong as you. [MISSY CHUCKLES] You're beautiful, Mom. Oh, sweetheart. [SNIFFLES] And I don't care what planet you're from. You're my family. [MISSY] Oh, Dale. No. No, you can't leave, Addison. I'll mobilize the whole Z-Patrol to stop you. Please, it's... I'm sorry, Dad. But this is what I was meant to do. [SIGHS] They're saying the alien ship is damaged. - It might not survive a launch. - It's not totally our fault. We just wanted to stop them from leaving. Well, serves them right for lying to us. We also lied when we first came here looking for the moonstone. Don't you get it? They are stealing from us. They're taking Addison. She's choosing to go with them to save her people. Well, I don't want her to go. No matter how far away she goes, she'll always be a part of our pack, Willa. With the reactor damaged, there is a 67.9% chance that we will not have enough energy to leave orbit. We must try. The longer we wait, the worse our odds. Okay. Think of me when you use them. They're supposed to shake, not me. Hmm. I'll miss you, bestie. Oh, I'll miss you, extra-terestie. [CHUCKLES] ♪ We are the Mighty Shrimp Couldn't be prouder ♪ ♪ And if you can't hear us We'll cheer a little louder ♪ I don't wanna leave, but the aliens need to find their home. Yeah. I know. - Which is why I'm coming with you! - What? It is impossible, Zed. Only our species is capable of space travel on the Mothership. You'd be fried by our stardust energy in a minute. I was afraid we would be separated by a couple hundred miles when you went to college. Now, we'll be galaxies away. [GRUNTS] [MOTHERSHIP] Core reactor is shutting down. Emergency systems activated. We must leave now. Even with our stardust power depleted, we must risk it. - [HOWLING] - [HORN HONKING] - [HOWLING CONTINUES] - [HONKING CONTINUES] Bonzo! You got your license! Show-off! [CHUCKLES] My rage will not be contained! You will not stop us from getting to utopia! We're actually here to help. You can find an infinite power source to recharge our ship? Wolves! We'll let you borrow the moonstone. Thought you might need a jump-start. The moonstone is powerful, but it is harmful to our people. [ELIZA] Not if you have an adapter. We just have to filter the moonstone power through our Z-Bands. You all would sacrifice to help us? Wolves always have each other's back, and Addison's a part of our pack. Forever. - [ELIZA] Wyatt? - Yeah? I like-like you too. [GIGGLES] Awooo. [CHUCKLES] - Transport us up, Mothership. All of us. - Yeah! [PERSON 1] This way! Come on. [ELECTRICITY CRACKLING] [PERSON 2] Yeah, here. [ELECTRICITY CRACKLING] - [ELECTRICITY CRACKLING] - [GROANS] I told you wolf tech doesn't play nice. Then we're gonna need an organic conduit between the moonstone and the Mothership. Only our people can connect to the ship's stardust reactor. But unfortunately, the moonstone's power is lethal to us. But your being half human might just work. You'll be a living bridge. Addison can do it. Yes, she's an alien. And a cheerleader. And a part of our pack. You were born for this. Ready? - [ELECTRICITY CRACKLING] - [GRUNTING] [SCREAMING] [GRUNTING] [SCREAMS] [MOTHERSHIP POWERING DOWN] [ADDISON] I couldn't hold on!

Oh, come on, Mothership! [CALMLY] Awooo. [BEEPING] That did it. Only a few more minutes now. I've been thinking. Why didn't your grandmother just tell us that you were the map? Why make our search so difficult? Maybe she thought there was something to learn by staying in Seabrook for a while. [MOTHERSHIP] Accessing mind probes.

[ADDISON] Look what happened once we overcame our differences. [A-LAN] You became friends. [ADDISON] We did. Together, we made progress. Conflict isn't always bad. Being challenged sometimes pushes us to be better. This is true. No one spoke up while our planet suffered. All because we didn't want to create disharmony. And now our planet's gone. Harmony isn't silence. Unity isn't sameness. Love is powerful. It can handle disagreements. [GASPS] I know where my grandma wanted her people to live! The most perfectly imperfect place there is. Yes. You have found our new home. [CHUCKLES] [SIGHS] Take us there, Mothership. Please. How come you don't have alien hair like your grandmother? Because I'm not an alien. I'm an ordinary person. An extraordinarily normal, fantastically fabulous, ordinary awesome person! Bucky, if you were different, - you know we'd... - Mock me? Accept you. Oh! Seabrook High's really gonna miss your awesomeness, Bucky. Yeah. [CRYING] I'm really gonna miss me too! - Come on. Let's go celebrate. - [BUCKY] Tell me again how great I am. [SPEAKING ZOMBIE] [BREE] It is gonna be awesome when we're all at college. Leaving Seabrook isn't the end. It's the beginning. I miss Addison so much. I wish she could be here. Me too. We were gonna change the world. [WHIRRING] [GASPS] [ALL] Addison! You came back! [SIGHS] You thought I was gonna let intergalactic space travel get in the way of graduating? But what about utopia? Seabrook is our utopia. But Seabrook isn't a perfect place. It's not. It's messy, emotional... Full of surprises. Where change can happen. Where someday can be today. [MOTHERSHIP] What a perfect place to call home. Now I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm just one proud mothership. I love you kids. - Party! - Party! Let's go! - What? - Come on, Bonzo! - Yeah! - [CLAMORING] [ADDISON] So, yeah. The aliens are moving into Seabrook. And even though our community is stronger than ever, and we're breaking down barriers every day, there's still more to learn. [ZED] So whatever the future holds for our monster of a town, we'll be ready for it. Because Seabrook's not about perfect. It's about progress. Which means we'll always welcome the unexpected.
