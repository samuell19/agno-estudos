[MUSIC PLAYING] [RADIO CHATTER] 68 minutes past ETA. Long flight. Be worth the wait if they brought him here in a box. -Where'd you find this guy? -Beirut. Whole operation took 11 hours. Really? Special forces grabbed him, took him by chopper to a carrier in the Mediterranean, then straight to Wiesbaden. Then they put him on that. [RADIO ON CHATTER] Was it Air Force all the way? Yeah. What I don't understand is why we're handing him over to you guys. Jurisdictional thing. Let the lawyers worry about it. Stay at ease, men. Be damned if I'll call them to attention for that son of a bitch. Captain Delgado, sir. Delivering a prisoner. Welcome to Andrews, Captain. This is Peter Nello of the US Marshal Service. He'll be taking custody. Anything for me to sign? Sign. I don't think so, sir. That's the first time in history the Air Force doesn't have paperwork. Well, this kind of came up sudden, sir. I know, Captain. It wasn't a criticism. My name is Peter Nello, United States Marshal Service. Do you speak English? Does anyone on board speak Arabic? He speaks English. -You're sure? -Yes, sir. He asked me for a cigarette. OK. Well, Salim Ajami, AKA Hassan-i Sabbah. I am placing you under arrest for violation of Title XIX United States Code Section 1.1.17. I will now read you your rights as required by law. You have the right to remain silent. If you give up the right to remain silent, anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to speak with an attorney and to have the attorney present during questioning. If you so desire and cannot afford one, an attorney will be appointed for you without charge before questioning. My orders are to transport you to a federal magistrate for arraignment. Do you understand? These men are other federal marshals. They'll be accompanying us. Move it, now. Yes sir. Let's go. Major. Captain. Thanks. Excuse me. My name is Ellis. Bradford Ellis. I'm a federal public defender. The marshal's right over there. Thank you. Excuse me. My name's Ellis. Bradford Ellis. -You the PD? Yeah. What's going on? Uh, I get a call in the middle of the night. You better see your client. Magistrate's on his way in from Alexandria. Why here? Why don't we just do this downtown tomorrow? Security. The guy's an international terrorist. What? Copy of the complaint. You gotta be kidding. What the hell's he doing here? He's supposed to be in the Middle East. He won't talk to us. I doubt if he'll talk to you. We've confirmed he speaks English, so that's not a problem. Well, what'd you guys do? Snatch him? Appreciate it if you'd run him through the drill as quick as you can. We want him arraigned so we can secure him tonight. -Uh, press know about this? -Not yet. They'll tumble to it in the morning. Just keep it cool. I don't wanna tell you your business, but you'll do lots of interviews. All right. Gentlemen. This is an attorney. He'd like to see his client. -Uh, think he'll be any trouble? -No. He's cuffed. Uh, I wanna speak to my client alone. OK. Uh, Mr. Ajami, I'm here to represent you as your lawyer. Do you have anyone else that you would prefer as an attorney. Uh, it's in your best interest to cooperate with me, Mr. Ajami. I don't know if you're familiar with our legal system, but everything between us is privileged. That means I'm require not to tell the government anything that you say. So ha-- have you spoken with anyone? Made any statements? How did you get here? Are you hungry? I could probably get you something to eat. Dawning on me that you're not gonna be responsive, so I'll just tell you what's gonna happen. This is the complaint. You are charged with conspiracy to commit murder. In a few minutes, there'll be an arraignment, and I'll argue for bail, which I doubt you'll get tonight, if at all. It's my job to make sure-- oh boy. Thank you, sir. All rise. On your feet. I said on your feet! Let him be. The United States District court for the Eastern District of Virginia is now in session. The honorable Willard Shoop magistrate presiding. Take your seats. Council. Len Gregory for the government, Your Honor. Bradford Ellis for the defense, Your Honor. I am told the defendant can comprehend these proceedings. That's by no means certain, Your Honor. I only have the word of a federal official on the matter. You Honor, the government has in its possession video tapes in which Mr. Ajami speaks perfect English. I can provide confirmation of that fact, but not until morning. Well, considering the hour, and my wife's mood if I'm not in bed when she wakes up, I'll accept the government's representation. Now, Mr. Nello. Raise your right hand. Do you solemnly swear that the information contained in your affidavit is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God? -I do. -All right. I've read the complaint. It looks in order. Based on my finding that there was probable cause to support these charges, I will now hear arguments relating to bail. Your Honor, in pursuance of the Bail Reform Act, and given the seriousness of the offenses and the nature of the defendant, we request that bail be denied. Mr. Bradley. Ellis, Your Honor. I haven't had sufficient time to consult with my client. I request a continuance of the bail hearing until tomorrow. Given the givens here, counselor, I'm denying bail. If you have any pertinent-- repeat, pertinent-- information by morning, call my chambers and I'll give you the opportunity to resubmit. Yes, Your Honor. The prisoner's remanded to the custody of the US Marshal. I'll be [INAUDIBLE] order tomorrow, which will calendar all further necessary dates pending an indictment. That said, course adjourned. Somebody help my find my car. I'm not sure where I parked. -Uh, yeah. I'll take you out to your car. REPORTER (ON TV): The outrage in the Arab world continues this morning, as news spreads of the capture of Salim Ajami. Lebanon has called for an emergency session of the United Nations Security Council to protest what it claims is a flagrant violation of its sovereignty. Ajami, the leader of a group expelled from the Palestine Liberation Organization, and a known international terrorist, is alleged to have been captured in West Beirut by an American military-- Nothing in "The Post." Bradlee will have their heads. No way they could have made the morning edition. I just heard about it driving in. Radio Cairo broke it late last night. You want any of this crap? Hell no. Then why do they have it here? When I look at it, my arteries start to clog. [BUZZING] I'll get it. Yes? Thank you. Attorney General's on his way up. Where was he? I heard he was in Arizona. Colorado. White water rafting. They must've reached him by dolphin. Why isn't Del here? His wife had an operation this morning? -Serious -Exploratory surgery. That's too bad. What is it, a female plumbing thing? 20 years of feminism and he talks about a female plumbing thing. Harry, go get your consciousness raised. -Come on, give you break. -Morning, gentlemen. -Sir. -Sir. Well, we've got ourselves a situation, haven't we? Did we just grab him? Apparently, took him out of Lebanon, then to an offshore carrier, then to a base in Wiesbaden, then here to Andrews. Not exactly an exercise in the niceties of extradition, but effective. President's delighted. He could take some heat on this. World opinion-- I'm told he had a word for world opinion beginning with a letter early in the alphabet. I'm also told he had an enormous breakfast. Speaking of which, would someone get me a cup of coffee, please. Frank, where do we stand? The prisoner is under maximum security at Quantico. He was arraigned last night around midnight. The magistrate came in from Alexandria, the PD's right off the list, and one of our assistants went down, bail denied. -He was Mirandized on arrival? -Oh, yes sir. All civil liberties protected. -All right. Who prosecutes? This is going to be a hell of a tough one. Who's mean, first rate, and most important available? What about that guy in New York, Dalcimer? He's too political. Not to mention that he wants my job. This trial could get it for him. Any objections to Jim Delmore? Do I take it your silence means consent? Well, God knows he's got the trial experience, and, uh, he can take the pressure, but-- ATTORNEY GENERAL: But? His wife went into George Washington today. She's in surgery. Oh no. Really? MAN: Well, it-- it may not be all that serious. I'll find out. -Let me know. Have the department send her some flowers, would you? This may be insensitive, but if is wife recovers quickly, I'm still inclined to go with Del. You might all be thinking of backups, just in case. Anybody care to take bets on the defense? Sure as hell won't be the PD. 10 to 1, the Arabs buy him Walt Kovack. No, Kovack's on, uh, The People versus Stratton. They just got started. Be serious. If they offer him this, he'll drop Stratton like a hot potato. Who else is available? Ask yourself a question, ladies and gentleman. What's happening at the American Civil Liberties Union this morning? Easy. They're all sitting around us like we are spitballing names. My guess is, they'll go with Sy Resnick. No way. Resnick's Jewish. So? So they're not gonna want a Jew to defend an Arab. Why not? John Adams defended British soldiers. This is different. Everybody will figure he'll throw the case. Extreme bias. He won't touch it. Sure he will. He'll get another book out of it. -Plus a rock video. -Doesn't scan. Trust me. They're gonna stay away from a Jewish lawyer. Best thing they could do is get an Arab to defend them. Any hotshot Arab defense attorneys? Doubtful. Mm? What are you, a racist? This from the man who talks about female plumbing. A fact's a fact. Ladies and gentlemen, I was wallowing in nature yesterday, enjoying myself enormously, and I just knew something would come up to ruin it. Since something did, I take that as clear evidence of advanced psychic ability. I think Frank's right. It'll be Sy Resnick versus Jim Delmore, give or take a sick wife. RESNICK: All right. Let's hear it now, from memory. Resnick's rules of justice. Come on. Don't hide your lights under a bushel. Hands in the air. Rule one! -Sir. Yeah. All criminal defendants are, in fact, guilty. Almost all. Key qualifier. Rule two. Yes, you. It is easier to convict guilty defendants by violating the Constitution than by complying with it. Good. Also correct. Rule three. Yes. All prosecutors, judges, and defense attorneys are aware of rule number two. And they all go along with it, except defense attorneys, whose job is to get the bad guys off, right? Right? -No, wrong. Whose job it is-- -To? ALL: Serve the system. To serve the system, which we all know is a lousy system. It's cumbersome. It's messy. It is populated by incompetence. It's biased toward the rich, and point of fact, it stinks. But. Come on. But? -It's the-- -Best-- -System-- -In the-- -Civilized world. Beautiful. Impeccable. Even adequate. [BELL RINGING] Now tomorrow, I would like you to think about this. A man shoots his wife. He assumes she's asleep, but she's already dead. However, he did not know she was dead when he shot her. Question, attempted murder or no crime at all? Concept of impossible attempts. Read chapter two in my book. It might help you. GIRL: Big might. Get out of here. Just get out of here. I'm still unclear on Fovie versus Rand. Why were there damages? Idiot. There weren't any damages. Consider yourself answered. [INAUDIBLE] exam on the 28th. BOY: Right. I know. Sir. I was wondering, why did Justice-- Next section. -Professor Resnick. -Yeah. Hi. Saw you watching. Very educational. It's a little like group therapy, isn't it? Socratic method. Keeps them awake. First year law? What else? I'm Lynn Kessler. We've left several messages at your office. I haven't been there yet. That's why I'm still wearing this. You said we. Oh, sorry. I thought I told you. I'm with the ACLU, New York office. I came down by train an hour ago. Why do I think you've been expecting me? Not you, specifically, Ms. Kessler, but someone. If you have a free moment, then I'd very much like to talk to you. You eat yogurt? -Not if I can help it. -Then you can watch. You're not even tempted? Not even tempted. -Professor Resnick. -Sy. Please. -Sy. We think there are significant issues here that-- No argument. It's a watershed case. Then? I have a full teaching schedule. I'm preparing an appellate brief for a guy who's on death row. I have two doctors contradicting themselves about why I'm getting migraine headaches. I also got divorced six months ago. I am in no shape to deal with a major trial. It would be a disservice to everyone, especially me. May I ask you a question? Sure. If you were free and clear, would you defend him? -Nope. -You didn't even hesitate. The man is responsible for the deaths of, what is it, five innocent people, including a child under the age of three. And that's just the scorecard on this charge. No. He's scum. -I must admit. I'm very disappointed. Well, by this time tomorrow, you'll have a line of defense attorneys around the block. We just thought you were the most suitable choice. The guy's a lowlife. Get Resnick. That's not the idea behind my coming down here-- Ms. Kessler. Lynn The timing is off, OK. -Is it? -No. It's none of my business. What? I was wondering if there's some kind of religious conflict. I'm a secular Jew. Some of my best friends would be Arabs if I knew any. I'm not staying away from this because of religion. I'm staying away because the guy is a true bastard. The system only works if even the true bastards have their day in court. Please. Don't lecture me, Ms. Kessler. I'm familiar with the system. Sorry. Me too. Look. When you get back to New York, tell Ben and Larry that I love them dearly and I appre-- It's nice to meet you, professor. I've read your books and I'm a great admirer. Until now. I'll give everyone your best. REPORTER (ON TV): To some in the Arab world, Ajami is a popular hero, and students have taken to the streets in what appears to be carefully orchestrated protest demonstrations. The State Department has cautioned Americans in the area to be aware of potential reprisals. At the same time, US military persons in Western Europe have been put on temporary alert. There's a rumor circulating in Washington that American intelligence has learned that a-- WOMAN (ON INTERCOM): We need a wheelchair in the day room, please. Wheelchair needed in the day room, please. REPORTER (ON TV): We're trying to find out if there's any basis to this persistent rumor, whether any more specific facts are known. -Del. -Doctor. Good news, Del. What? I did a laparoscopy, and there's absolutely no evidence of any carcinoma. She's fine. Can I see her? She's back in her room. She'll be waking up by now. Thanks. Thanks very much. My pleasure. They should all be like this. WOMAN (ON INTERCOM): Dr. Stuart, line 272, please. Hi. How are you feeling? We'll see. Honey, it's OK. GINNY: Hm? I spoke to the doctor. It was benign. Are you just saying that? No. It's really OK. Really. You're supposed to cry if it's not OK. Now you're supposed to laugh. I can't. Oh. Stitches. Funny. What? I think your officer just called. My office? Yeah. Maybe I was dreaming. No. The phone kept ringing. I thought they were supposed to turn that off. They are. Well, it rang and it rang, and I got annoyed, so I answered it. It was your office, and they were looking for you. I told them you weren't here, and then they asked me how I was. And what did you tell them? I told them to go to hell. Ah. [DOOR CLANKING] I hope they fry your ass. What, you think it's funny? Hey, I'm talking to you. Hey. You don't kill kids, you understand? You don't kill kids! What the hell are you doing? Guards! Guards! What the hell are you-- stop it. Are you crazy? Knock it off. Knock it off! Get him out of here Just go with him. I want an incident report started right away. And send a corpsman. Are you all right? Is anything broken? The doctor's coming right away. I don't know what happened either. He just-- he just kinda freaked out. Doesn't make any sense. Yes it does. It's the first man in your country that I understand. Free Ajami! Free Ajami! Free Ajami! WOMAN: Give Ajami freedom! CROWD: Free Ajami! Free Ajami! Free Ajami! Free Ajami! Free Ajami! Free Ajami! Free Ajami! WOMAN: Let him go! CROWD: Free Ajami! Free Ajami! Free Ajami! Free Ajami! [BUZZING] Yes? Send him in. Morning, Del. -Good morning, sir. You wanted to see me? Please, sir down. Coffee? No thanks. How's the wife of course. I understand she got a clean bill of health. We're lucky. It was a scare, but she's fine. Good. Expecting much of a convalescence? About a week or two. Reason I ask-- or do you already know? Pretty hot grapevine around here, sir. Yeah. Sometimes even accurate. Well, do you want it? -Yes, sir. Very much. Maybe you should give it some thought. Lot of pressure. Lot of hours. It can put a strain on a marriage. I already talked to my wife. She said if I was offered it, I should grab it. And you always do everything she tells you? I think I'll take the fifth on that. All right. Run with it. Figure out what you need and let me know. I want to stay in very close touch. Thank you, sir. Important case, Del. On this one, I'd assume we're on the side of the angels, but who knows? Did you see those demonstrators outside? When I came in. Absolutely bizarre. They're marching for a man who murdered at least 20 or 30 people. Well, as they say, it's a free country. OK. All those against. Sorry I'm late. What? What's going on here? Polling the class, sir. Straw vote, pro and con. Your rejection of the Ajami defense. Who said anything about that? The paper, sir. This morning. According to the ACLU. Somebody have this morning's paper, please. I do. GIRL: Seems that a majority says we hope you change your mind. GIRL: Sir, if I can quote from your book, the prosecution enjoys the full weight and resources of the state and federal government, which is why the advocate for the accused must have a corresponding resource, i.e.-- --i.e. a commitment to the concept of due process. Said commitment to apply even if the offense is of a grave and heinous nature. -Yes, sir. But you left out the word passionate. You wrote a passionate commitment. I stand corrected. What makes you think I turned this down because of the nature of the crime. Well, we just assumed that-- Make assumptions at your own risk, Ms. McWilliams. And while you're at it, ask yourself why I should not consider this vote an invasion of my privacy. Well, we were only try-- The first right of an attorney is to pick and choose his cases without pressure, and pressure includes leaks to the papers that are designed to embarrass and all coerce. It also includes straw polls. -Yes, sir. Having exhausted the subject, I would very much like to get back to first year law. Any objections? Good. OK. Attempted murder, or no. Good morning. What is it? There he is. [SHOUTING] One at a time, folks! One at a time! Please. One at a time. The grand jury just returned a true bill indicting Mr. Ajami. -A trial date. -What? Is there a trial date? That's up to the judge. When do you expect to get the answer? I'm sorry, that's all I'm gonna say at this time. [SHOUTING] A federal grand jury sitting in Alexandria, Virginia today handed down an indictment against terrorist Salim Ajami for the slaughter of five American tourists in Barcelona two months ago. This is the first such indictment under the new federal statute, covering acts of murder of American civilians overseas. Ajami's capture, incarceration, and impending trial remain unique to this state. We're still awaiting details concerning the controversy surrounding Ajami's defense. MAN (ON TV): Thank you, Stan-- -Mr. Resnick. Yeah? Oh, hi. Come on in. Get some light in here, huh? So what can I do for you? I, uh, wanted to apologize for the other day. We were all out of line. Particularly me. Matter of fact, I was the one who was out of line. You guys were all revved up and challenging me, and I acted very badly. So sit, please. Uh, I'm afraid I can't offer you any coffee. My hot plate's on the fritz here. Really, I don't wanna take up any of your time, but about that vote. I just-- I just want to-- I want to say that my motives were less than pure. Oh. I'm always interested in impure motives. I mean-- I mean, I know you've used-- you've used members of your class to assist in your cases. So if by some slim chance I should conduct the Ajami defense, and if I needed help-- Yes sir. A lot of us would like to be involved. Even to the point of defending a man like that? It's not about him, sir. It's about due process. And you believe in due process? Yes, sir. Don't you? So I've been saying for the last 25 years. Well, that's what I wanted to tell you. Thanks for your time. I pulled your records. Beg pardon? I looked over your filed. Very impressive. Over achiever. In my family, an A minus was considered a failure. Then they had nothing to complain about, did they? That's a very nice thing to say, thank you. I should admit to a bias. Concerning? This case. I-- I'm living with someone. Graduate student. He's from Iraq, and that's why it interests me so much. How does he feel about Ajami? Well, if you'd like to come over one night for dinner. I'm sure he'll tell you. I-- I'm not much of a cook. Well, I doubt that, Ms. McWilliams. Over achievers are very consistent, you know. Anyway, it's an open invitation. Thanks. [PHONE RINGING] Yes? WOMAN (ON PHONE): Simon Resnick? Speaking. WOMAN (ON PHONE): The attorney general calling. Just a moment, please. CATLETT (ON PHONE): Mr. Resnick. Yeah. Lawson Catlett here. I see my secretary tracked you down. It seems that way, sir. No place left to hide. CATLETT (ON PHONE): We've never met, but I'm a great admirer. You've roasted some of our people pretty good on occasion. And vice versa. CATLETT (ON PHONE): Rarely. You wouldn't be coming to Washington within the next few days, would you? I'm afraid not. Well, then I'll have to do this by phone. We understand you have no interest in representing Salim ajami. RESNICK (ON PHONE): That seems to be an open secret. I had a call from the president this afternoon. He wanted me to relay his compliments, and ask if you'd reconsider. Not that it matters, but I was not a supporter of the president in the last election. In the immortal words of Lyndon Johnson, professor, he's the only president we've got, and he feels, as do I, that this trial has to be an absolute showcase for the American system. Considering the way Ajami was brought into the country, you got off on the wrong foot. Perhaps. But with you as his attorney, no one can say he wouldn't be getting the best defense. I gather he is not speaking to anyone, including his own PD? CATLETT (ON PHONE): Not quite true. He met with several representatives of the Arab League today. Based on their advice, he is prepared to accept you as his counsel. I see. Tell me something. What if I get him off? Pardon? I said what if I get him off? That's what you're supposed to do, isn't it? Be quite a feather in your cap. I have the feeling you don't think that's very likely, huh? CATLETT (ON PHONE): My opinion is irrelevant, professor. Your decision is what counts. I just hope you'll consider the president's request. You'll be doing a service for your country. Which, in the nature of things, my fellow citizens are not going to appreciate. All right, sir. I'll give it some serious thought. Fine. Look forward to meeting you one of these days, professor. Goodbye. Damn. Back already? I'll get it for you. Good morning, judge. Up early today. I'm still asleep, George. She's up early. Ah. Morning. Thank you, George. She's headed for the water, Edna! Make sure she doesn't drip all over the kitchen. Edna? Somebody just called, judge. Left a message on your machine. Oh, thank you. Edna, I'd like some tea, please. Just make it with a bag. Yes. KATE (ON VOICEMAIL): Judge. This is Kate at the office. I came in early to do some filing because the painters had the [INAUDIBLE] blocked off-- Get to the point. EDNA: What? Not you, Edna. KATE (ON VOICEMAIL): Anyway, um, Judge Klein's clerk got in even earlier than I did, and he left a message for us. Get to the point, Kate. KATE (ON VOICEMAIL): And so what I wanted to tell you, is, anyway they drew your card and you've got the Ajami trial, so if there's anything you want me to do before you get here, let me know, because um-- You must've walked her pretty good. She drank almost a gallon of water. Did she? Here. I'll take her. Sometimes I envy you, little girl. You have such an uncomplicated life. Mr. Ajami. I'm Simon Resnick. Might as well sit down. We'll be here for a while Two points. One, I want to make it very clear that what I've been told is accurate, that you want me to represent you. It is agreeable to me. Two, that you intend to cooperate in your defense. What I do not need is your silent. I have been silent to show my contempt for these most criminal actions of your government. I have been kidnapped, beaten, and taken illegally from my country. Under our system of law, Mr. Ajami, there is no relevance as to how a defendant is brought into court. Once he's there, the judge and jury are bound to try him. This will not be, I am told, a military tribunal. No. I will be filing motions to challenge that. Again, illegalities. I am a prisoner of war. The government will contend this is a murder case. No more, no less. Acts of war are not murder. In point of fact, the systematic killing of non-combatants for political purposes is the definition of terrorism, not warfare. We do not abide by the definition of Western colonial powers. They are your definitions, not ours. To us, there are no non-combatants. All right. Look. I don't have to agree with you, Mr. Ajami. I just have to defend you. I'm very good at that. We don't have to convert each other. We don't have to be friends. So I won't make any political speeches and you can save yours for the [INAUDIBLE]. You know, of course, that I'm a Jew. Our fight is with the Zionists. I have nothing against the Jews. I need a minute. What? When Adolf Eichmann was captured, he said he had no animosity toward the Jews. Said he loved them. That has nothing to do with me. He was a bureaucrat. And you? I am a man who fights for the self determination of the Palestinian people. With their consent. Starving refugees are in no position to make political or military choices. Is it possible you have no understanding of what I say? Let's hope I do, Mr. Ajami, since I'm all you've got at the moment. Shall we go to work? They're very clever. The first thing they do is corrupt the language. They appeal to our sympathies by calling themselves guerrillas or freedom fighters. And they're not? MAN (ON TV): Guerrillas are irregular soldiers who wage war against military personnel, not innocent civilians. As for freedom fighters, where is freedom in the countries where they've won? Can the opposition speak freely in Libya, in Iran, in Angola? He's been doing the talk show circuit. "Today," "Donahue." You know. Now, I think he'd make a-- a useful expert witness. What do you think? -Pass. Oh, come on, Del. Resnick's gonna be all over you with claims of legitimacy. Soldiers in a war of liberation, today's terrorist is tomorrow's head of state. We've got to have refutation. I wanna keep this as narrow as it can get. Murder. That's what we're talking about here. That's all we're talking about. Won't be all he'll talk about. He'll throw in the kitchen sink. And we'll get it thrown out. We'll block him. Anticipate and block. I wanna Stonewall this boy from using this thing is a forum. Lots of luck. I'll show you something. I've been saturating myself in this guy. He's a real piece of work. You know the alias of his, Hassan-i Sabbah? Yes. He took it from the leader of the original assassins in the 12th century. Yeah. Nice? -Lovely. DELMORE: soldier in a war of liberation crap. He's a hired gun, used by the Iraqis against the Syrians, then by the Syrians against the PLO. When he's not killing people, he's raising money to kill people. Pretty soon, you stay in business just because you're in business. And you forget why you started in the first place. All I know is, he put out a hit and five people got killed. I don't give a damn about his reasons. Everybody's got reasons. Resnick can dance all he wants, but I'm gonna put this son of a bitch on ice until the cows come home. And he probably will. Don't say probably. Don't ever say probably. These questions are not necessary. Because they're personal? Because they are not the issue here. Do I have a wife? Do I have a child? Such matters are meaningless for my defense. Not if they relate to motive. My motives are political. You know that. I know what you tell me. I know your public posture. The truth may be something else. The fact is, Mr. Ajami, information about you, personal information, is very hard to come by. If you were me, I guarantee you would hide your history. There's been speculation in the press that you were radicalized by the deaths of your wife and children in a bombing raid on Lebanon. Let it remain speculation. He wages war because his family was killed. It is too simple. It ignores the calamities of the region. The broken promises. But it is something a jury can understand. I will not discuss it. Right. Salim Ajami. Place of birth, unknown. Possibly a Palestinian, although Ajami is not a Palestinian name. Education. Either self taught or a graduate of the University of Damascus. Profession, either architect, fruit picker, or engineer. Gaps. Gaps and contradictions. No contradiction. I am a Palestinian. You broke with Arafat and Fatah in the mid '80s. Why? They were not accomplishing anything. Have you? The very fact that I exist, that I strike when they are present is an embarrassment to them. It forces them away from moderation. Why do you ask such questions? You are being deliberately provocative. Listen to me. If we put you on the stand, the prosecution will try to make you look like a gangster, or a psychopath, or both, so you better learn to deal with provocative questions. This is useless. You're treating me like a child. And you're treating me like I'm the enemy. You are the enemy. Does that mean you'd kill me? Maybe I am your enemy, Mr. Ajami, but not in court. Not in court. All right. Here's your steak, Mr. Resnick. Thank you. Del likes his burnt to a crisp, so it'll be a while. You sit down. I'll take care of it. No, no. You guys have gotta talk. Besides, you'll make a mess. Salad's coming up and there's more beer. Oh, I'm fine, thanks. It's just a big piece of meat here. We're a family of carnivores. I'll consider myself warned, thank you. Kids, in the house. Clean up. How old are your boys? 9 and 14. Absolute monsters. And they've just discovered sex. Oh, God help you. We're gonna take them on a cruise this vacation. Greek islands, the whole family. I'd sure like to wrap this up by then. You're asking me? Ah-huh. Hey, I want it over, too. I'm so backed up, I can't see daylight. Then we agree. Short and sweet. You wouldn't hit me with any motions for continuance, would you? -I tell you what. You want it fast, let him cop a plea. Right. What does he settle for, manslaughter or vagrancy? So why did you take him on? Wish to hell I knew. Part manipulation. Your boss had a hand in that. And part the fact that I keep getting trapped by my own big mouth. -Come again? I've said these things all my life. Right to counsel, due process. And I suddenly realized, I mean them. If your boy ever wins, he'll make due process ancient history. That's why I wanna rub his face in it. What's he like? True believer? RESNICK: I don't know. Any sense of remorse? None. Guy's convinced he's right, so anything goes. That's the tragedy over there. You can talk, you can reason, then you hit a wall. You cannot get through. Somebody better get through to somebody. Too many people are getting killed. So-- so I'm out, right? I mean, just like that. It isn't a question of in or out, Mr. Ellis. As I said, I would appreciate any help or advice you can give me. I don't believe this. I mean, all of a sudden, they won't let me see my client, and then I read in the papers that you're replacing me. I mean, is that how you big boys operate? The parties involved think this is a more useful approach. I'm expected just to go quietly, right? Uh, hey, appreciate your help. Come on. Who are you kidding? By this time tomorrow, you're not even gonna return my phone calls. RESNICK: Oh, knock it off. -What? I know exactly where you're coming from. I've been there myself. You figured you had a reputation maker. All those talk shows and the North American serial rights. Don't measure me by your standards. Oh, my mistake. I guess none of these things ever crossed your mind. Yeah. Eh. That's not the point. The point, Mr. Ellis, is that your history. This is the real world, and there's not much you can do about it. Well, thanks. Thanks a hell of a lot. There is a but. I don't think I really wanna hear it. Yes, you do. I'm staffing right now. I'll use some of my students, and I'll pick up counsel from the ACLU. Look, as far as I know, you're a mediocre lawyer, but I'm gonna take a shot on you, mostly because you were in on this from the beginning. So you can hang out with us for a while, and if you're any good, you can stay on for the trial. So you're buying me off. Don't overestimate your value, Mr. Ellis. There's nothing you have to sell. All right. Hope I didn't take up too much of your time. Let me know, huh? I'll be breaking you down into research groups, and each team will focus on one specific subject. For the moment, this is an educational process. No strategy or tactics, although I'm hoping that whatever you come up with will spark me. I have no ego in-- ha. Scratch that. I have an enormous ego, but not in this area. So if anybody has any ideas, directions, whatever, lay them on me. The floor is open. Let me research, uh, terrorism worldwide. Red Brigades, Japanese Red Army, Baader-Meinhof. You're aware, I assume, that whatever you dig up could be more helpful to the prosecution than to us. Why? Mr. Ellis, tell her. Well, uh, all right. You claim legitimacy, Mr. Ajami. And so does every other gang of nutcases in the world. What should a jury give more credence to your cause than to theirs? And if we give everyone credence, if everyone's cause is just, then we open the door to anarchy and the abrogation of all law. -That's very good, Mr. Ellis. -I still think-- So do I. Do it. Jim Delmore will. So should we. Yeah? I'd like to research the Eichmann trial. RESNICK: Fine. That could be very helpful. What about the Quran? What about it? Would you like me to do a synopsis of it. I think I can manage to read it in its entirety, if I so chose. If you want to be helpful, Andy, find somebody who understands Hebrew and go over the transcripts of the terrorist trials in Israel, OK? Done. Patrick. Military law? Broad category, but absolutely vital. I think you're gonna need three or four more others for that? Count me in? Good. I see Miss Kessler is wiggling her fingers. There's been some new thinking on the Nuremberg Trials. Might help any jurisdictional motions. Good idea. Thank you. One more thing. Check all CIA activities in the Middle East before the Barcelona killings. Anything they might have done to pour oil on the fire. All right. Obviously, we're just taking the first steps here, and I might not be able to use anything you give me, but let us indulge in overkill. OK? That's it. Go to work. I'll meet you back here same time tomorrow. And thank you. I liked that speech, Mr. Ellis. Let's hope Delmore doesn't use it against us. You want the truth? Sometimes. The prosecution won't control this trial and, uh, neither will the defense. Ajami. Ajami. Uh, I spent some time with them before you, uh-- Stole your case. Before you came in. Ah-huh. And one thing he said-- uh, he was feeling a little bit more relaxed than usual-- he said he had nothing to lose. He'd use this trial as an act of war against the American people. Tell me something I don't know. [MUSIC PLAYING] HASAAD: There are things in the Palestinian experience that those in the West cannot begin to comprehend. You must understand that when you speak of the Palestinian, you speak of a different way of life. The cultural differences are profound. Hasaad, cultural differences or no cultural differences, people don't wanna get killed. That's a given, and it transcends national origins. So do the rights of self protection. You're not suggesting that Ajami's, call it his war, his jihad, is justified? I oppose his methods, but there are many people who feel exploited. They respect your values and they feel ignored by you. You're here. Do you feel ignored? My parents brought me to this country when I was 12. I had no choice. Come on, Hasaad. You like it here. -I'm used to it. -Look. If you're saying I can't get into Ajami's head, that's fine. I don't need to get into his head. What I need is a way to defend him. He won't help you. He'll help me whether he realizes it or not, because the difference between him and us is he gets his day in court, which is more than I can say for the people he kills. Trish. What do you call this stuff? It's absolutely terrific? It's Hamuth Haloo lamb with, um, chopped dates and apricots. There's the answer. The road to peace is through the stomach. They send us Hamuth, we send them Big Macs. No? No. Hasaad, I'm curious. The Arab states, how will they perceive this trial? Publicly, they will make a token denunciation. They couldn't give support to a nation that has such a pro-Israeli posture. And privately? Some will be happy. When men like Ajami kill, they kill mostly Arabs. Nobody seems to realize that we're not just talking about Arabs. I mean, look at the Red Brigades. They're Italians. Middle class kids. Things don't change fast enough for them, so they murder people. I mean, look at the IRA. -Trish. I swear I'm going to send you over to the prosecution. Sorry. On second thought, maybe I should send myself, because as of now, I don't have a clue how I'm gonna defend that son of a bitch. You'll do what you can. Oh, great. Go through the motions, serve the system. What should we do, then, shoot him? A friend of mine said when they found Ajami, they should have put a bullet through his head. Why bother with a trial? I just don't believe that. That's his way. Not ours. All right, counselor. All right. Point noted. MARSHALL: If Your Honor's asking my advice, I say we should keep as high a profile as possible. Your troublemakers, your incendiaries. Show them an M-16 carbine, they tend to fold. Puts a chill on things, if you follow me. You're not suggesting that we have weapons on display here in the courtroom, are you, Marshal? No, ma'am. Although in this situation, given the need for abnormal security, I'd place men on view, outside, with weapons folks can see. Now, the marshals in here will be armed, of course, but their pieces will be concealed. And exactly how many marshals did you have in mind? A dozen, more or less. Most of them seated, but some floaters. We want to cover the hallway, the lavatories, and I'll station a man in your chambers. You feel that's necessary? Hell yes, Your Honor. There are cases where somebody goes after the judge. Go on. We'll have two metal detectors, one downstairs, one just outside. Also, x-ray machines. On top of that, we'll make checks of briefcases and purses. Anybody has to go the bathroom, we run them through the circuit all over again. The press? We'll issue passes each morning, collect them each afternoon. Reporters are going to scream. It's a lot of fuss. But you avoid false credentials. All right, Marshal. Thank you. Have your office put these procedures into writing and submit them to me for review. Yes, ma'am. Oh, and one other thing. We've had some discussions about placing the prisoner behind bulletproof glass. That won't be necessary. But if somebody gets off a shot-- Marshal. If somebody gets off a shot, then all of these precautions you've been describing are less than effective. Yes, ma'am. And also, please keep the public in mind. I want as many people as possible to have access to this courtroom. Your men are to be as unobtrusive as they can be. We don't want to give the impression that we're under siege. Begging your pardon, but we also don't want any incidents. Then we shall have to find a balance, won't we? Yes, ma'am. And that balance will not include a flagrant display of weapons. That is not the kind of face that I, for one, want to show to the world. Thank you again, Marshal. Uh, Marshal. This is a housekeeping matter, but you should be aware of it. I'm going to request that a room in this building be equipped with a television set, and that set will be connected to a camera in this court. Now, that room should be guarded when and if necessary by several of the men. Any particular reason, Your Honor? Perhaps no reason, other than to indulge my intuition. REPORTER (ON RADIO): Demonstrations continue in the Arab world as well as here in the United States over the kidnapping and trial of Salim Ajami. Terrorist groups in Italy and other European nations claim that American talk of a fair trial is a mockery. There are increasingly vehement threats that reprisals will be taken. US embassies in Europe have beefed up security, and American citizens in the area have been warned by the State Department to travel with caution. I forbid it. You will not, under any circumstances, call a psychiatrist as a witness to this trial. To an American jury, what you've done is an irrational act. I can make use of that. Oh, by suggesting that I'm insane. Talking legally, not clinically. What you do is discredit a revolutionary movement. You explain away our cause by saying that we're madmen. What I say is that no one can order the execution of the innocent without some damage to the spirit. It's an act of fanaticism, and fanaticism can be construed as unbalanced behavior. I have made rational choices. Military choices. I will be defended on that basis. You are really limiting me. Then withdraw. Sure as God made little green apples, if you practice law, you will eventually represent a client who refuses to cooperate. You'll be frustrated, because he'll reject the very strategies that can lead to an acquittal. Case in point, Ajami, a psychiatric defense. But even when the client is intractable, you are still obliged to serve his best interests. So you must explore other avenues, including those which are highly controversial. Such as-- anybody? Yeah, go ahead. -Graymail? Exactly. Graymail. The threat to reveal classified material in open court. Exactly what are you getting at, Mr. Resnick? Your Honor, within seconds of the tragedy, the local militia was suddenly on the scene. They shot and killed the suspects. Now, that's an incredible coincidence. Why were they there so quickly? Are you saying our people had advance knowledge, that they let this thing happen? I won't know, unless and until I'm permitted discovery of the relevant CIA and DOD files. These are dangerous waters, Mr. Resnick. I know that, Your Honor, I have no wish to put our agents in jeopardy. But I must pursue my client's interests. I believe I have a remedy. Unless, of course, this is just a maneuver to get the government to drop its indictment-- and I am sure that such a possibility never crossed your mind. Then under the Classified Information Procedures Act, you and I will be granted security clearances and we will examine the relevant material. How does that strike you? Eminently fair, Your Honor. Mr. Delmore. I have no objection, Your Honor. RESNICK: Question from the floor, yeah. Sir. If you're defending Ajami, isn't it unfair, I mean unethical, to discuss his case with us in class? Good question. Actually, I mentioned I might do that, and he said, go ahead. It's kosher. Although that was not the word he-- he used. Maybe he wants all the publicity he can get, huh? Yeah. I don't know whether I should say this. I guess it sounds naive. RESNICK: But. But that kind of tactic, graymail, offends your sensibilities. Well, yes. Dirty pool. Yes, sir. I think so. Your vision of a defense attorney, then, is someone who only helps the oppressed and the disenfranchised, and even for them, you would put a limit on how far you would go. There have to be limits. No. Your obligation is to pursue every legal recourse, however remote, and however distasteful. In the service of someone like Ajami? In the service of the law. This system only works if the worst of us, even the monsters, have their rights protected. If we make exceptions, any exceptions, then we open a very dangerous door. -Mr. Resnick. My reading on the material indicates that there was no prior knowledge on the part of the authorities. Do you concur? It would seem that way, Your Honor. A very grudging acknowledgement, counselor. Grudging because there are clear indications that our agents may have infiltrated Ajami's organization. And no evidence whatsoever that anyone knew in advance what he was planning. I am satisfied that the coincidence you noted, Mr. Resnick, was merely that. A coincidence. The local police happened to be nearby. Therefore, I assume the matter of testimony from undercover operatives is closed issue. Yes, Your Honor. For the moment. For the moment? JUDGE: None of that, Mr. Delmore. Yes, Your Honor. And you, Mr. Resnick, will refrain from unnecessary provocation. Apologies, Your Honor. This trial will be hard enough without extraneous friction between counsel. I have no patience for it. May I count on your cooperation? Yes, Your Honor. Of course, Your Honor. Very nice. -Yes, I am angry with you. -Why? Because I didn't bring you cigarettes? I'm not allowed to. You know that. The case I will make, you will make, is that what I did is justified. It is the only defense I will accept, since you have failed to move this to a military court. That is not true, at least not yet. We have filed pre-trial motion that challenges the right of a federal to even hear this case. Your government will never permit a military trial. They wish to make an example of me. It's not the government's decision. It's up to the judge. She will do the same. Probably, but we have to push the buttons, and you have to let us push the buttons. I have no objection to this motion. Really? Thanks a hell of a lot. Maybe next time, I'll even smuggle you in some cigarettes. I must say, Mr. Resnick, I am inclined to deny your motion. Your Honor. Respectfully, there is international precedent for the acceptance of revolutionary groups as combatants. Salim Ajami is a prisoner of war. He has no business being tried in a federal court. So you stated in your motion, and quite eloquently, but new federal statutes apply. No, thank you. Your Honor, the Geneva Diplomatic Conference of 1977, in protocol one, explicitly states that such actions, no matter how perfidious come under the heading of acts of warfare. Mr. Resnick well knows that no state of declared war exists between us and those his defendant claims to represent. No declared state of war existed between us and Vietnam. Yet, men like Lieutenant Calley were tried in a military court. Mr. Resnick also knows that the Geneva protocols were heavily influenced by third world pressure groups. The United States has never been bound by them. Your honor, my poi-- Gentlemen, we are not making a record here. My purpose was merely to advise counsel that in all likelihood, this trial will go forward. Official ruling to be rendered Monday next at 10 o'clock. There's no graceful way of doing this. I dated a girl once, I mean, we're talking elegance on wheels. And she blew it for me when I saw her eat pizza. She, uh, couldn't handle the strands of cheese. So? The guys did a great job. This stuff is gold. LYNN: But you're not dancing around the room. Because I can't use it. Bonner won't let it in. None of it. That's just a guess. Take my word. She'll keep it narrow. The last thing she'll permit is a history lesson on the Middle East, or American complicity with counterterrorism, of your stuff on Nuremberg. Doesn't leave much room to maneuver in, does it? Nope. The only plus about defending the indefensible is that nobody expects you to win. Trouble is, I like to win. Which is a little tricky when you're stonewalled by the judge as well as your own client. Well, as soon as she hands down her rulings, I think I better go do my courthouse steps routine. Can't we skip that? I resent it when I see lawyers sounding off on the tube. Necessary evil. Legitimizes your case. You've gotta create a climate where the jury or even the judge can decide in your favor without fear of community backlash. I guess. Seems to me so much like showbiz, though. Tell him. It is showbiz. Were you satisfied with the jury, counselor? Very much. I think they'll deliberate with open minds and not be influenced by some of the hysteria you people have been drumming up. But you didn't ask for a change of venue. Where would we go, Mars? You seem to be unhappy with the judge. On the contrary. I have the highest regard for Judge Bonner. We are unhappy, however, with some of her pretrial rulings. Such as? One, she's denied our motion to dismiss on jurisdictional grounds, and two, she's excluded certain witnesses we'd very much like the call. What witnesses? Soldiers who observed atrocities that went unpunished. Experts on the bombings of Hiroshima, Dresden. Come on, now. We saved thousands of lives by dropping that bomb. Americans and Japanese. We also deliberately killed innocent civilians. Isn't that the definition of terrorism? But counselor, that was war. So is this. Resnick's running his mouth again. Why break a habit? He's not careful, I'd hit him with a gag order. Oh, no way she'll do it. Not on this one. So we just let him talk? Well, you know the drill. The defense talks, the prosecution leaks. Who do you know in "The Times?" I know we'll find somebody. Well, when you do, have lunch with him. While we're breaking bread? You might mention that most of the press seems to think Ajami is a Palestinian. Every terrorist, if you believe them, were born under the same fig tree in Jaffa. Ajami wasn't? I have it on pretty good authority that he's either Lebanese or Syrian. I also hear he's from a wealthy family, so we're not dealing with some poor refugee from the camps. I'll slide that in over coffee. Slide something else while you're about it. We're getting rumors that Ajami was eased out of Al Fattah because of his temper. He liked to kick people around. I mean, literally. Especially women. A good reporter might want to look into that. I better make some calls. Why don't you? And get the other guy to pay for lunch. RESNICK: So I'll be sweating it out in Virginia, and you'll be on your summer vacation. It doesn't smell like a long trial, so I should be back by the fall semester, at which time, you can all tear me to pieces for the way I handled the case. OK, that's it. Go and get educated, will you? [APPLAUSE] [BELL RINGING] Thank you. Wonderful. Appreciate it. You're doing very well. See you in the fall. Wait. Where you going? You're not gonna wish him luck? No. -Bad form. -Listen. My family had friends who were on a plane that was hijacked. It was five years, and they still can't sleep at night. So I'm not gonna wish him luck, OK? [KNOCKING] -Mr. Resnick? -Yes. We're sorry about the lateness of the hour. They said that we could find you here. You are? Raymond Duschav. This is David Goldberg. Marvin Halpern. Gentlemen, sit down. Please. Something I can do for you? Something that you can do for yourself. Get off the case. I beg your pardon? The Ajami case. Tell them to find somebody else. Who are you? I'm chairman of a fund raising organization for Israel. These gentlemen are major contributors. We were shocked when we read that you, of all people, are going to defend this Arab. I don't know why you should find this so unusual, Mr. Duschav. If you know anything about me, you know that I've defended pornographers, mafia dons, people like-- -You don't see the difference? Oh, yes. But Ajami has a right to be defended. He has a right to hang by the neck. Look. This case is clear as crystal. It's not quantum physics. It's a simple equation. Man kills Jews. You're a Jew. You wipe your hands of him. I think you're missing the point. No. You're missing the point. Don't give rap scum like this the Constitution. Go defend the Grand Dragon of the Ku Klux Klan, if you turns you on, but drop Ajami. Am I being threatened? You're being told. Brother to brother, Jew to Jew. Cut the bastard loose. You'll sleep better at night. In just a few hours, this quiet corner of Virginia will be the focus of worldwide attention. It's just after sunrise, and yet there is a palpable air of tension, as dozens of federal marshals scour the area. The major participants have not yet arrived. Judge, jury, counsel for the defense and prosecution, and of course, the prisoner, Salim ajami, who will be transported here each day from Quantico. Security, as I've already mentioned, is a major concern. Federal marshals have even commandeered the rooftops across the street from the courthouse. Meanwhile, threats of reprisals continue from an increasing number of terrorist groups. -Cab's waiting, Judge. -Good, George. And don't you worry about this one. I'll give him a good work out. Her, George. He's a she. -Oh, right. Sorry. Uh, Your Honor. Give them hell. Prosecution here. Delmore will have at least three at his table and I'll be by myself. Symbolic. David and Goliath. -Lynn. You and Brad will sit here. Trish, I'm gonna get you a seat right behind my table, and I'm gonna sit as far away from Ajami as possible. Is that a good idea? It looks like you're disassociating yourself. Fine. If the jury thinks I don't like him, maybe they'll like me more. Sometimes it comes down to psychology. I'm gonna put myself physically between him and the jury. In order to get to him, they're gonna have to get through me first. Now, there is another ploy-- Pardon me. Are you Simon Resnick? -Yeah. You son of a bitch! How can you defend him? He's scum! What kind of a man are you? Hey, mister. Come on. Come on. -Must be crazy! Thank god he didn't have a gun. You all right? You got a bad burn. We gotta get you to a doctor. There's no time. Gotta get back to the hotel and change. Damn! -What? My only suit. [SIRENS BLARING] PROTESTORS: Free Ajami! Free Ajami! Free Ajami! Free Ajami! Free Ajami! Free Ajami! Free Ajami! Free Ajami! Free Ajami! Free Ajami! Free Ajami! Free Ajami! Free Ajami! Free Ajami! Free Ajami! Free Ajami! Free Ajami! WOMAN: They should've just shot him when they caught him! PROTESTORS: Free Ajami! Free Ajami! Thing of beauty. Except that tie. You don't like my tie? I've seen better. What's wrong with my tie? It just makes too much of a statement. Well, thanks a hell of a lot. Now I'm gonna spend the rest of the day worrying about my necktie. Let's get over there. Come on. This should've been done by now. Listen. What do you think of this tie? [MUSIC PLAYING] Here you are. You must wear your badge at all times. -Come on, Deb. -What? We gotta go now. MAN: You must wear your badge at all times. Next, please. Here's this. Thank you very much. Right this way, sir. This way. Keep moving, please. MAN: Hey. We all have to wait, you know. WOMAN: Excuse me. Hold it. They're right up front. Thank you. Excuse me, please. How's he holding up? Well, depends on your point of view. He, uh-- he made me switch ties with him. Hardly the act of a rational man. Guard this with your life. Don't say anything about this tie. Morning. How do you feel? I was hoping they would leave these on. They don't wanna do it that way. Would make for an interesting photograph. That's why they don't wanna do it that way. Are you ready? You seem to think this is important to me. It is not. I do not even feel I am here. Yeah. I'll see you in a few minutes. I'd like you to stay as far away from him as possible. Thank you. Just like we drew up. You notice Resnick's hand? Bandaged. He's going for the sympathy vote. [INAUDIBLE] today. All rise. In the presence of the flag emblematic of the Constitution of the United States of America, and representing the principles for which it stands, this district court of the Eastern District of Virginia is now in session. The honorable Leona Bonner judge presides. Please be seated. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Call the case, please. The United States of America versus Salim Ajami. Mr. Ajami has been charged with five counts of conspiracy to commit murder. Council, please state your appearance. Good morning, Your Honor. James Delmore on behalf of the United States. Good morning, Your Honor. Simon Resnick on behalf of the defendant, Salim ajami. BONNER: Does the prosecution wish to make an opening statement? -Yes, Your Honor. -Proceed. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury. I repudiate this court. I am not on trial here. You are on trial with the [SHOUTING] -Counselor! Advice the defendant he is out of order. RESNICK: This is not going to help! I've been kidnapped! I have been kidnapped from my country. Mr. Resnick. Have you no control over your client. Apparently not, Your Honor. Mr. Ajami, you are out of order. [SHOUTING] Marshals. Remove the defendant. This court is in recess. [SHOUTING] Counselors, my chambers. Now. [SHOUTING] This will not happen again. It's bound to. He wants to disrupt the trial. Mr. Resnick, have you no influence over it? I'm afraid not, Your Honor. I think he's doing this deliberately. He wants to force you to restrain him. BONNER: Physically? Yes, Your Honor. He's playing to the world press. If you chain and gag him, that's exactly the image he wants to send out about American justice. I think you're right. And oddly enough, I anticipated something like this. Mr. Resnick, I want you to take a message to your client. One more outburst and you'll spend the rest of the trial in here. It's legal, they have a TV hookup, and you'll be able to watch. But you'll be out of the spotlight, which I don't think particularly serves your purpose. There's no way the judge is going to have you bound and gagged, if that's what you wanted, so it's up to you. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, this is a murder case. A murder case. You will hear about a crime so grievous that it staggers the imagination. You will also hear that the defendant was not present at the scene, and there may be arguments that, because of this, he bears something less than full responsibility. However, as the judge will instruct you, in a case of conspiracy, which simply means people acting together for a common purpose. Every person involved, no matter where he is, no matter what his role, is fully and completely responsible for the actions taken by every co-conspirator. It may help if you remember the 1930s in America, and especially the gang wars in the underworld of Chicago. Imagine a high level mobster putting out a hit. That man is as guilty as those who carry out his orders. Even moreso. And that's what we face here today. A hit. Nothing more, nothing less. Whatever you may hear about justification and the redressing of grievances, and however powerful the justification or real the grievances may seem to you, please remember that motive is not a defense. Regardless of his reasons, if you come to believe that the defendant instigated and directed this cold blooded crime, then you have no choice but to find him guilty as charged. The people of the world will be watching us. I know, ladies and gentlemen, that you won't disappoint them. Counselor. Do you wish to make your opening remarks at this time? Yes. Thank you, Your Honor. I would. There are a few thoughts I'd like to share with you. First, in the eyes of the world, the United States cannot legally try Salim Ajami. However frustrated this nation is by what it perceives to be terrorist activity, it cannot begin solving that problem by an act of kidnapping or by the invasion of another country's sovereignty in order to achieve it. Nor can the United States morally try Mr. Ajami on the charges it presents because of its own history of killing innocent civilians. At Hiroshima, the checkerboard bombing of Europe in World War II, at My Lai in Vietnam. The United States has performed its own brand of terrorism and cannot be allowed to sit arrogantly at the right hand of God and condemn the acts of others. So I hope, ladies and gentlemen, you'll keep this in mind as the trial unfolds. Thank you. Mr. Delmore, call your first witness. Thank you, Your Honor. Call George Flanders. Raise your right hand, please. Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God? I do. State your name and address for the record. My name is George Flanders. I live at 3250 North Greenway Boulevard. City and state please, Mr. Flanders. Oh, yes. Sorry. Uh, Crescent City, Iowa. I'd like to direct your attention to this past July 16. Where were you on that day? I was on a cruise. Were you alone? No. I was with my wife, my daughter, and my son-in-law. And-- and they brought their little boy along. My grandson, Jeremy. This was a pleasure cruise. Well, it was a present. My son-in-law was having some business problems. He's in farm equipment supply. And, well, he was kind of depressed, so I invited him and Ellie, my daughter, to join me and Mrs. Flanders on this cruise we were taking. I said things would look up if we all went over the Bounding Main together. They brought Jeremy because my daughter didn't wanna leave him at such an early age. Jeremy's how old? Was. Not is. Uh, he-- he was a few months shy of his second birthday. Yes, of course. Thank you. Now, Mr. Flanders. You remember the events of July 16? How in God's name could I forget? Would you describe them, please, for the jury? We docked early in the morning in Barcelona, Spain, and we took a bus tour of the city. That's a way to get the feeling of the place when you don't have much time. Who was on this bus? About 30 of us from the ship. -Americans? -Yes. Just about everybody on the cruise was from the states. DELMORE: did your daughter join you? Yes. And where was the baby? She brought him with us. He wa-- he was a good little boy. People were afraid he'd start crying or get cranky, but he never did. While you were on this tour, did you make any stops? Yes. About one o'clock, we stopped for lunch at a restaurant. Allie stayed on the bus with Jeremy. He was napping and she said she wasn't hungry. When we finished, most of the people went to the restrooms, but some of us started boarding the bus. And, uh, well, that's-- that's when it happened. I know this is difficult for you. Take your time. Well, I noticed these two men outside the restaurant when we got there. I don't know why, but I thought they were out of place. They were nervous, and they had these kind of long coats on. It was pretty warm, so it seemed strange. I didn't think much about it. Then, when we were boarding the bus, I saw them again. They just walked over to us and they took these guns out of their coats These long, strange looking guns. And they, um-- and they started shooting. I mean, it was just un-- unbelievable. Suddenly, there was all this screaming. I couldn't find my wife. I mean, here it was, this nice, sunny day, and these two men just came up to as and opened fire. Then, then one of them saw my daughter. She was inside the bus, holding Jeremy in her arms and trying to see what was happening. So this man, he just looked at her for a second, and she looked at him, and then-- and then-- Do you want me to ask the judge for a recess for you? No. What he did was, he shot her. He shot her and Jeremy. Point blank. The glass in the window just ex-- exploded. Jesus. There was nothing I could do. What happened next, Mr. Flanders? Well-- well I just kind of fell down. I don't know it, but I'd been shot in the leg, so I fell. I saw the men running. The Spanish police were there. I-- I could hear more shots, and both of them were hit. They were trying to get to a car, but they didn't make it. The police just kept shooting at them. Then, I guess, I lost consciousness. When I woke up, I was in a hospital. They operated on my leg. I didn't find out 'til later that two other people died. I-- I kept asking about my wife, and they finally told me she was dead. My wife, my daughter, and little Jeremy. My son-in-law wasn't hurt. Well, he was hurt. His mind. He never leaves his house anymore. The grass in his law is all yellow. He doesn't mow it, doesn't water it. DELMORE: I'm almost finished, Mr. Flanders. What I'm going to ask you to do now is difficult, but I want the jury to share this tragedy with you. Your Honor, I'd like to introduce government exhibit number one. Uh, Your Honor. The defense is not aware of this exhibit. What is it that Mr. Delmore seeks to introduce? These are photographs, Your Honor. A tourist was able to take pictures at the scene. Objection. Prejudicial and inflammatory. You Honor, these photographs came into our possession only yesterday. We feel that the jury is entitled see them. The defense was entitled to see them as well, Your Honor. Their sudden appearance seems suspiciously fortuitous. The people who died should not be reduced an abstraction, Your Honor. May we approach the bench? The man who took these photographs debated long and hard whether or not to release them. He finally decided to send them to us. Your Honor, the witness was sufficiently eloquent. To introduce these photographs would be inflammatory and excessive. We feel that the jury should see this slaughter with their own eyes. I don't think it's necessary to your case, Mr. Delmore. I'm gonna sustain the objection. I protest. Mr. Delmore. Let me make something clear. During the course of this trial, I intend to give considerable weight-- you may come to deal with that's special consideration-- to the needs of the defense. I'm not sure I understand. If you lose in front of the jury, that's your problem. If you win and I get reversed, that's my problem. I'm not going to give Mr. Resnick points to reverse me on appeal. Very well, Your Honor. Let the record show the objection is sustained. Mr. Delmore. No further questions, Your Honor. Your witness. Defense does not wish to cross examine Mr. Flanders. The witness is excused. The government's final witnesses of the day were an officiale of the Barcelona police and a handwriting expert who testified that the communiques found on the two dead terrorists were written by Salim Ajami. This seems to be a very strong start for the prosecution, especially combined with the tearful testimony of George Flanders, who lost most of his family, including his baby grandson, in the vicious attack. Cut. Come on. Follow me. Tomorrow, the prosecution is likely to play the Ajami videotape. Any comments? -Yes. In pretrial motions, the government moved to introduce a redacted version of the tape. The motion was denied. They have to play it in its entirety. Is that important? Mr. Delmore keeps saying this is only a murder case, but the videotape, the part he wanted to exclude, opens up areas that he'd rather not deal with, that we intend to make very good use of. Thank you. Excuse me. -What about George Flanders? What about him? Don't you think his testimony was devastating? I mean, no jury would acquit after that. What, do have a crystal ball, or is it a divining rod? I'm just saying-- -You've heard one side. Now, unless you want us to pack it in, we're entitled to put on our case. One of these days, you people are gonna understand the way this system operates. No more questions, please, ladies and gentlemen. We'll see you tomorrow. Lost my temper. Stupid of me. -Yeah. Trouble is, she was right. Flanders was devastating. Cold bastard. I, Hassan-i Sabbah, take responsibility for the military action yesterday in Barcelona. It was carried out by two young Palestinian of great courage, who willingly martyred themselves. We have moved against the Americans, because we have come to believe that they are a true enemy. All of the other Western states, including Israel, are merely clients of this most evil colonial power. Know, then, that we have made the citizens of the United States our target. As our children die, so will their children die. We will not the respect their bodies, and we will strike at them in their home country as well as overseas. We do this so that the world will not forget our rightful grievances, and will pressure the American administration to reverse its perfidious policies. Long live the Palestinian people. Lights, please. The prosecution rests, Your Honor. Thank you, Mr. Delmore. I think this is a suitable time for recess. Mr. Resnick, are you prepared to open for the defense after lunch? -Yes, Your Honor. Then court is adjourned until two o'clock. All rise. Nice case. Wanna get some lunch? Yeah. You hungry? Aren't you too busy? Ball's in Resnick's court now. All I do is listen. [MUSIC PLAYING] [SPEAKING ITALIAN] I don't believe it. Damon. How are you? I didn't know you were gonna be in Italy. You look terrific! It's great to see you. So how long you staying? Where are you? [CHATTER] [SPEAKING ITALIAN] Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you may be surprised that, while the prosecution put on this case, we neither objected nor cross examined. The reason for this is, every word they said was true. But by giving you only half a case, they've given you half a truth. Because something essential, something very basic, was not mentioned by the government, and that is the simple fact that the defendant is a soldier. He is here, against his will, as a political prisoner, and we ask you to judge him as a member of an enemy army. An army you may thoroughly despise, but an army nonetheless. It is the tragic nature of war that people are killed. Even, and sometimes especially, the innocent. But soldiers engaged in battle are not put on trial in federal courts for murder, and the definition of what constitutes a battle has changed over the years. The acts of the defendant may horrify you, but they are military acts, committed in the context of a war. Your Honor, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, since we do not dispute the facts presented here, we call as our first and only witness, the defendant, Salim Ajami. [WHISPERING] Do you solemnly swear or affirm that the testimony you give will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth? -Yes. What is your name? Salim Ajami. Colonel Salim Ajami. Colonel is your rank? Yes. Your Honor, we would like to introduce as defense exhibit number one, Colonel Ajami's military ID. Objection. Military ID by what authority and what army? If Mr. Delmore would give me a moment, I'll happily defend and answer those very questions. Would you hold your objection in abeyance, counselor? Yes, Your Honor. I'll give Mr. Resnick his moment. Very kind of you, Mr. Delmore. Would you tell the jury how you came to be a colonel? It was a rank given to me in the service of the Palestine Liberation Organization. The military service? Yes. When I was with Fattah. And when you broke with Arafat, you retained the rank? -That is correct. -Now, Colonel Ajami-- Objection. We're not convinced that Mr. Ajami is a soldier anymore than a member of the Cosa Nostra is a soldier just because one of the five families says he is. Your Honor, Mr. Delmore keeps slipping in his gangster analog, which we find to be prejudicial. In addition, the United States is not entitled to question or second guess the military rankings of other governments. Our country does not recognize the PLO, Your Honor. RESNICK: Our country did not recognize Red China at one time, but it existed, as did its military personnel. -Your Honor. Counsel, please. Approach the bench. Mr. Delmore. As I have already said, I wish to avoid any appellate reversal here. Let him put on his case. DELMORE: Yes, but, Your Honor. I will deal with your concerns when I instruct the jury. If you say so, Your Honor. I do say so. The objection is overruled. Mr. Resnick, you may continue. Colonel Ajami. As a soldier, then, you feel yourself to be fighting a series of military engagements? Yes. What do you hope to achieve? The restoration of our homeland and our rights of self determination. These things were taken from you? Stolen from us. A theft that has been sanctions by the Western powers, most particularly, the United States. We fight to recover what is ours. Just as, would you say, the black majority in South Africa makes use of any means it can to-- Objection. If Mr. Resnick finds my analogies prejudicial, what would he call his own? -Sustained. RESNICK: Withdraw the question. -Colonel Ajami. The jury may wonder at this new kind of warfare. The two men you employed to carry out your operation were not wearing. -I did not employ them. No money was paid. They were soldiers. RESNICK: Then why weren't they wearing uniforms? Because they could not have fulfilled their mission. They would have been stopped by the police. Are you saying that a man can be a soldier and commit an act of war even when he's not wearing a uniform, when his weapons are concealed? Yes. In this kind of war, yes. The Geneva diplomatic conference in Article 443, protocol one, expressly states that combatants must distinguish themselves from the civilian population while they're engaged in an attack. Did your men not violate this provision? No, because there is an exception. I will read it. "There are situations in armed conflict where, owing to the nature of the hostilities, an armed combatant cannot so distinguish himself, but he retains his status as a combatant, providing he carries his arms openly during each military engagement, and during such time as he is visible to his adversary." Let's the clear about this. If you step up to your enemy, even without a uniform, and your weapon hidden, you still comply with the protocol as long as the weapon is on view during the actual attack? Yes. The government's witness said he saw guns, meaning they were on view when the shots were fired. Your men, therefore, retained their status as combatants and should have been tried in a military court. Objection. Defense is challenging jurisdiction again. A motion that was already denied. As for the Geneva protocols, the jury should be aware that the United States has never accepted them. In point of fact, the United States abstained. It did not dissent. I would ask counsel to refrain from making speeches. The objection is sustained. Mr. Resnick, please continue. Colonel Ajami. Before the prosecutor asks you this question, let me ask it myself. Why? Why did you give the order to kill innocent civilians? How could that possibly be the job of a soldier? Our goal is political. To persuade the American people that they will never live in peace as long as my people are without homeland. How else can this be done without military operations? We must cause the Americans to rise up against their elected officials. We have no jet planes. We have no nuclear weapon. We are few, and our enemies are many. We must do what we can. Even so, Colonel. Civilians. Innocent civilians. No one is innocent. Not even children? We think of our children. The conditions under which they live are obscene. They play in cesspools believing them to be lakes. They are consumed by disease and poverty. There is little food and little hope, yet the world ignores them. Would you say these military operations are a way of making the world pay attention? Of course. America, in particular. If we wage battle against Israeli Soldiers, it is a few lines of print in your newspapers. But if we seek out civilians, American civilians, then you will at least begin to listen to us. And you have not listened. Mr. Ajami. -You have not cared. -Mr. Ajami. You have brought this on yourselves. Mr. Ajami, you must stop this. And we will let you rest until you recognize us. I cannot let this continue. Mr. Ajami. Long live the Palestinian people. [GAVEL BANGING] Mr. Ajami, you will confine yourself to answering questions. This is not a forum for propaganda. I speak here to the world. You speak here to this court. If you wish to address the world, you do so at the proper time and place. What time? What place? I have been kidnapped and kept in prison. I warn the defendant and his attorney. I only have a few more questions, Your Honor. Proceed, but the patient of the court is sorely tried. Colonel Ajami. Do you consider yourself a terrorist? No. I will say it again. I am a soldier. And the incident in Barcelona was in the context of a war? Yes. It was one of many battles. Battles you fight to seek a homeland for your people. To regain a homeland for my people, yes. Might there also be other reasons for this war you're waging? Personal reasons? -I do not know what you mean. -Colonel Ajami. Isn't it a fact that your family was killed during a bombing raid? I said I would not discuss this. -You must. -No. Then you deny the facts that your wife, your two children are not-- You have fabrications, not facts. Is this not a photograph of you with your wife and children-- Objection, Your Honor! All of them killed during that raid? Mr. Resnick. Is this not your family? My family is of no value to this cause! There are parents on this jury. Fathers and mothers. Help them to understand your rage. Many families were killed. That is the proper answer to this question. Many families. We will have quiet in this court room. All right, Your Honor. I'm finished. Mr. Resnick. One more outburst, and the defendant will be removed from the court for the duration of the trial. Understood, Your Honor. Just make sure your client understands. He's had ample warning. This court is adjourned until 10 o'clock tomorrow morning. [CHATTER] Where the hell's the light switch? I've got it. I'm bushed. We should've taken a cab. Here it is. Oh, man. Sy. I didn't know you were here. No lights? The return of the migraine. And I thought it was only my ex-wife who could give me one. ELLIS: Want some aspirin? No, thanks. I took some. So how was dinner? LYNN: Terrible. ELLIS: Anything on the, uh, television? Yeah. They showed some courtroom sketches of Ajami staring at the photograph. Bravissimo! Page three. Think it'll do any good? Who knows? But I don't give a damn who catches News at 11. It's those 12 warm bodies in the jury box. If I can just sway one of them, then we got a shot. How did Ajami react to all this? Raked me over the coals. Accused me of superimposing his head over somebody else's body. Did you? No way. What happened was, I contacted that Arab group that wanted me to represent him. They came up with the photos. I didn't ask how they got it, and they did not volunteer any information. Just don't tell your client. Sy. Maybe I'm becoming paranoid, but I think two men were following us tonight. They were near us in the restaurant and I saw them downstairs in the lobby. Did you notice? Big guys, short hair? Yes. How did you know? They're cops. It's all right. I called them. Why? Well, we've been getting death threats, and a few sounded more serious than normal. Come on. You mean there are normal death threats and abnormal death threats? You got it. Anyway, they'll keep an eye on us for a while. ELLIS: Very comforting. Yeah. Welcome to the big time. Your witnesses, Mr. Delmore. Go for it. Mr. Ajami. You say that you fight in the name of the Palestinian people. Yes? Then why have you killed so many Palestinians? In a revolutionary struggle, there are always traitors from within. Who decides if someone is a traitor? This is common knowledge. Isn't it a fact that you decide? That the traitors is defined by you? And when you speak of freedom, don't you really mean freedom for your side only? And when you speak of traitors, don't you really mean moderates? -Objection. Unfounded attributions. -Sustained. -Mr. Ajami. All this wanton slaughter. Why is it necessary? Are there no other approaches? No political solutions? Political solutions have been exhausted. DELMORE: Who says so? What? Simple question. Who says so? Did you just wake up one morning and say to yourself, today is Tuesday. There is no longer any possibility for a political remedy. I think I'll go out and start killing women and children? Objection. I'll rephrase it. Mr. Ajami. Who decided that diplomacy offers no possibility for success? We have been savaged by diplomacy. So once again, you decided. It was your conclusion that war is the only alternative. It is the conclusion of those who have no home and no hope. Well, was there a vote? Did the Palestinians whom you claim to represent elect you? We hereby invest Salim Ajami with the power to make decisions for us in matters of life and death. A vote is not necessarily. The needs of the people give us a mandate. I see. Their needs as perceived by you. Very well, then, Mr. Ajami. You have been waging what you call war. Tell the jury about your victories. How much land have you been able to reclaim by all this fighting? A mile? An acre? And inch? We have just begun. Just begun? Mr. Ajami, it's been decades. And during that time, diplomacy, which you so revile, has made gains that can be measured in actual territory. What are your gains? What has your body count accomplished? Would you have us do nothing? It takes force to earn your respect. Well, that certainly justifies the death of babies, doesn't it? Infanticide in the name of respect. Tell me something, Mr. Ajami. Where did you go to military school? It is not necessary to go to school. We learn to fight in the camps and in the streets. Then you had no military training, yet you claim to be a soldier. I am a soldier. Oh, yes. Someone in the PLO, which you abandoned said you were a colonel, so you're a colonel. And these two men you sent to do your dirty work. Were they soldiers too? Or were they psychopaths? Religious fanatics? Or just street kids who needed money? They were soldiers who gave their lives. Oh, yes. That's right. In your videotape you say, and I quote you, that they willingly martyred themselves. Well, frankly, Mr. Ajami, I'm puzzled. If they were so willing, why were they running for a car to make their escape? That doesn't sound like an eagerness for martyrdom to me. And why, when there are major American military bases all over Spain, didn't they attack one of them? We select our targets to serve our purposes. Isn't it the case that you couldn't persuade these soldiers, as you call them, to attack a military base because they knew they'd be met with armed resistance? AJAMI: No. Because they were too cowardly to fight real soldiers. This is not so. According to you, the deaths in Barcelona were the consequence of battle. Is that your definition of a battle? Walking up to unarmed people and shooting them? Battles take many forms. Then by your logic, if I were to draw a weapon and shoot you, here and now, that would be a battle, wouldn't it? A military operation. After all, you say we're at war. You are not a soldier. As it happens, I am a soldier. In the US Naval Reserve. Does that mean that if I were to pull out a gun and shoot you, sitting there, in cold blood, that I should be tried by a military court and protected by the Geneva protocols? Situations are not the same. Mr. Ajami. We all know there are weak armies in the world. They don't seek out non-combatants. Why do you? For reasons of political leverage. In other words, to attract our attention. So what we're dealing with here is the killing of innocent women and children to get on television. The committing of atrocities to make the evening news. Is that the case? -Objection. Argumentative. Sustained. If you don't get our attention, if we eventually become enured to all this bloodshed, then what? You'll have to up the ante, won't you? Your Honor, counselor's confusing the witness by the use of American slang. DELMORE: I'll clarify. Mr. Ajami. If the killing of innocent women and children doesn't give you the access to the media that you feel you deserve, would you then torture women and children? We will do what is necessary. How about nuclear weapons? If you had them and you deemed it necessary, would you use them? RESNICK: Objection. Your Honor, the jury has a right to know just how far Mr. Ajami would go for his cause. Is there nothing you wouldn't do? I will answer. I want to answer. Our intention is to make you deal with us. Our demands must be met. If we had nuclear weapons-- and one day we will-- yes, we would use them. So you'd blow us all to smithereens in the name of land? Not just land. Our homeland! Our rightful place! The United Nations lists 45 groups who have refugee status. These are people without a homeland. They don't seek out and kill the innocent. Why do you? Because their situations are different from ours. Your cause is just. Yes. The Red Army in Japan. Is their cause just? They are our brothers in the fight for freedom. The RZ, the [INAUDIBLE] group in Germany, the Action Directe in France. Is their cost just? AJAMI: Yes. All these just causes, and yet none of the groups I've mentioned seek a homeland. They have other grievances. Then it isn't just land that you believe in killing for. What you really mean is that murder is the answer for any complaint, so long as you believe the cause is just. Murder for land, murder for revenge, murder for pro-Marxist ideals, murder by the right, murder by the left. -Objection Withdraw the question. What question? Counselor's engaged in a conversation with himself. Point well taken, Mr. Resnick. Sorry, Your Honor. Isn't it true, Mr. Ajami, that you will, if acquitted, continue this campaign against women and children? And all for a piece of Earth that's been under dispute for thousands of years. To you, it is a piece of Earth. You minimize it, sir. Is it were your homeland. If it were my homeland, I'd move heaven and earth to get it back. I'd propagandize, I'd negotiate, but I wouldn't kill the innocent. You have killed the innocent! The hands of the west are covered with blood. Do we deliberately seek out women and children as our primary objective? This is your tactic, not ours. AJAMI: You have killed your share of civilians. In Southeast Asia, in Tripoli, or when the Battleship New Jersey bombed the Chouf Mountains in Lebanon, you killed civilians. No. Not by design. Not as a policy. They were tragic accidents of war. But for you, the killing of non-combatants isn't incidental. It's your main intent. Our main intent is the return of our homeland! Do we slaughter tourists at airports? Do we explode car bombs in civilian neighborhoods? Do we shoot helpless old men who sit in wheelchairs? You do worse. If we ever deliberately seek out the innocent, I condemn it. I condemn all terrorism. But you are the one who is on trial here now. And the alleged crimes of others are no excuse for the crimes that you've committed. Your Honor, this is unconscionable. Did you order the executions in Barcelona? Yes. I've answered that. Yes. -Mr. Delmore. And you feel no remorse? They are casualties of war. So are you, Mr. Ajami. -Your Honor. -Mr. Delmore. If you do win, what can we expect from a government of butchers? [GAVEL BANGING] -Your Honor! -Mr. Delmore. Stop this at one. I beg the court's pardon, Your Honor. No disrespect intended. I recognize that we are dealing with emotional issues here, but there are limits to cross examination. Yes, Your Honor. I have no further questions for this witness. The jury is instructed to disregard that last exchange. Your Honor, with the court's permission, I would like to ask just a few questions on redirect. Proceed. Colonel Ajami. Isn't it a fact that you had absolutely nothing to do with the incident in Barcelona? What? That these killings were the work of some other group and that you took credit to enhance your stature in the eyes of your supporters? -It was my operation. -Was it? I suggest that you made your videotape after the fact that, and that you got your information from the newspapers. No. And you still claim the attack was ordered by you. Yes, of course. Like you also claim that your family did not die in that bombing raid. -Objection. Defense is maligning his own client. Mr. Resnick, where are you leading? If Your Honor would give me one moment, please. -Proceed. -Colonel Ajami. You told us that you would do anything for your cause. Isn't that correct? I repeat, isn't that correct? Yes. Then how do we know you're not lying for your cause? How do we know you're not lying right now? You are the liar. I suggest that your confession is a total fabrication from start to finish, and without that confession, the government does not have a case. This is outrageous, Your Honor. I object. This is a foolish trick. I have taken responsibility. Your Honor, I have no further questions. I am the one responsible. Your Honor, the defense rests. [GAVEL BANGING] I think I've made it clear that I'm not pleased with some of the liberties taken here today by counsel. I trust closing statements will follow more traditional lines. Court is adjourned until 10:00 tomorrow [MUSIC PLAYING] MAN: Can I call you about this tomorrow? What time would be good for you? OK, I should be back-- who are you? What do you want? Who are you people? Look, I-- Please don't kill me. Please don't kill me. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, we began by trying this case as a murder case. But the defense has insisted on opening the door to the subject of justification, of legitimacy, and we are compelled to respond. Americans are in the habit of trying to be fair, of believing that there are two sides to every story. But I suggest that there are not two sides to terrorism. That there is no rational argument for the deliberate and systematic killing of the innocent to inspire fear. It is unspeakable and indefensible. These groups march under a flag that says our cause is just, but everyone with a grievance, every lunatic, every criminal, every mindless misfit with a grudge can find just cause for every action, however extreme. Every cause is just for those who believe in it. Are they entitled, then, absent an immediate solution to their grievances, to do as they will, up to and including murder? But of course, if they're cunning, they won't call it murder. Too harsh a word. Too judgmental. Not very good PR for the media. So they call it war, or politics. Thus, they eliminate the idea of crime, of culpability. They're not cowardly killers committing morally outrageous acts. They're soldiers and heroes, because their motives are pure. Ladies and gentlemen, there are terrible inequities in this world. Yes, there are many who are suffering. Yes, we do not pay attention to their needs, and for this, we should be ashamed. But terrorism, much of it sponsored and supported by the enemies of democracy, is not the answer. The savage slaughter of the innocent-- I repeat, the killing of non-combatants, not as an incidental result of warfare, but on purpose as a primary strategy, must be condemned. Ladies and gentlemen. You have it in your hands here to determine minimum levels of civility. I call upon you to render a verdict of guilty and send a clear message to the world. Thank you. [MUSIC PLAYING] Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, this man before you was not born into an American home, nor was he brought up among Americans. He comes from a different culture, different world. And it is far easier to sit in judgment on one of your own than to do what is asked of you here, to judge someone who, for all intents and purposes, might as well be from another planet. We are not asking you to excuse him, but we are asking you to understand him. If you had been brought up as he has, if you had borne witness to the horrors he has seen, are you absolutely certain that you would not have joined an army at some point, any kind of army, and dedicated yourself to war? The judge will doubtless instruct you that this is only a murder case. But you, the jury, have the last word, and you must take into consideration what drives Salim Ajami. Now, we wanted to mount an insanity defense, but he refused. To us, what he did it seems a product of madness. But to him, however misguided, it was an act of patriotism. In his mind, and in the minds of many of his followers, he is a soldier. Now, we are not only a system of law. We are also a system of compassion. Let us show those who have suffered his pain that our way is better. Let us send a different kind of message to the world than the one that Mr. Delmore requests. Condemn the act, but show that we understand its tragic origins. And keep in mind that the defendant may not have even committed the crime that he confessed for political reasons, or that he was tragically manipulated by our own Central Intelligence Agency. And finally, remember the Achille Lauro case of 1986, where an Italian court gave so-called terrorists a reduced sentence because, quote, "they have grown up in the tragic conditions that the Palestinian people live through." I ask you to send this man back where he came from and give him the impossible task of explaining why our society, which he despises, was humane enough to set him free. And I thank you. Mr. Delmore. Rebuttal? Ladies and gentlemen, you've been asked to be compassionate. But then where is justice? You've been asked to be understanding, but then where is accountability? Why even bother to have courts and trials at all if we acknowledge that there's a rationale-- and there always is-- for every crime. You've heard all kinds of justifications here. You've even been asked to make foreign policy by confounding our enemies with our human behavior. But I submit that it all comes down to one simple question. Is there ever any justification in any society, and for any reason, for the deliberate seeking out and killing of the innocent, including a defenseless baby? As of this noon hour, the jury is now sequestered in the Ajami case. After hearing instructions from the judge, the 12 men and women have retired to the jury room for their deliberations. In a related matter, the missing photojournalist Elliott Sanderson is apparently a captive of the Red Brigades, an Italian terrorist group. From Bologna, Italy, this report from correspondent Jeff Larkin. Questions regarding the whereabouts of journalist Elliott Sanderson were answered last night when local newspapers and television stations received communiques from the notorious Red Brigades. Accompanying the statement were photographs of Sanderson in captivity, and a tape recording of his voice. ELLIOTT (ON TV): My name is Elliott Sanderson, and I am alive and well. I am instructed to say that I am a hostage of the Red Brigades, and that I am to be put on trial by a revolutionary tribunal. This is their way of showing their solidarity with the political prisoner Salim Ajami, who is on trial in a corrupt American court. If I am convicted, my sentence will be death. The voice of Elliott Sanderson, presumably alive and somewhere in Bologna. Local authorities are working closely with the United States embassy in keeping Sanderson's family updated on any new developments. Bastards. What do you expect? They want their headlines now. We knew there'd be reprisals. Trial by revolutionary tribunal? Corrupt American court? What crap. Not much anybody can do about it now. -Del. -No, no, no. They're still out. But, uh, you won't believe this. Won't believe what? Resnick's holding a press conference. -Now, before the verdict? -Yeah. Come on. You go to see. RESNICK: I would like to address myself to the recent events in Bologna, Italy, and to the kidnapping of Mr. Sanderson. His abduction is a direct and unfortunate response-- He's grandstanding again. Jeez, Tan. Somebody might get the impression you're a cynic. They say they intend to put Mr. Sanderson on trial. Well, if they're not afraid of a fair trial, if there is to be even a rough approximation of justice, then he must be provided with qualified counsel. I therefore offer my services to Mr. Sanderson, and challenge the Red Brigades to accept me as his defense attorney, and I'll go anywhere, at anytime, to any place they specify. JOURNALISTS: Sir. Mr. Resnick. Our legal system gave due process to Salim Ajami. Let us see if the Red Brigades dares to do the same for Elliott Sanderson. Is this offer symbolic, counselor? Not at all. I mean it. Kind of unorthodox, isn't it? What isn't orthodox? I get on a plane, I go where they want me, and I represent my client. You don't even know what they're charging him with. Neither do they, but we all know they'll come up with something, don't we? But don't you think the State Department will respond to this? -I have no idea. Ask the state department. [SHOUTING] Think he's sincere? Sure. He believes in the damn system. But just think of the book he's gonna get out of this if they come out of there alive? He's put them in a corner. If they don't accept, they love face. Either way, he comes out smelling like a rose. -The jury's back. -I can't believe it. They haven't even been out two hours. Thank you. Mr. Foreperson, have you reached a verdict? Yes we have, Your Honor. And do you have the verdict form with you? Yes, Your Honor. Would you give it to the clerk? The verdict appears to be in order. Will the defendant and his council please rise? Please publish it to the court. We, the members of the jury, in the case of the United States of America versus Salim Ajami, case number CR964A find the defendant Salim Ajami guilty of all counts charged in the indictment. [APPLAUSE] [GAVEL BANGING] Silence, please. Ladies and gentlemen. You have heard the verdict of guilty. Is that the verdict of each of you? -Yes, Your Honor. -Mr. Resnick. Do you want to poll the jury? No, Your Honor. Ladies and gentleman, the court wishes to thank you for giving careful and thoughtful consideration to these proceedings. In many ways, this has been an historic trial. You've served the system well. Now, I'm sure that members of the press as well as other interested parties are going to want to speak with you about your deliberations here. You are free to discuss the case of them or to remain silent. The choice being entirely yours. You're excused. Bailiff, please show the jury out. Step this way. Gentlemen, we have to select a sentencing date. Now, my calendar shows an opening three weeks hence on the 14th. Is that agreeable to both of you. TOGETHER: Yes, Your Honor. Then I order a pre-sentence report by the probation department to be filed with the court not later than three days prior to the day of sentencing. Prisoner's remanded to custody. Court is adjourned. -All rise. Well, we'll appeal. On the jurisdictional issue. In the end, it will be the same. Maybe. -I'm grateful. -Why? We lost. As you said. If I'd been acquitted, it would have confused those I represent. By convicting me, you provide them with a martyr. Somehow, I think you see yourself more as a bargaining chip than a martyr. We will see. You had your day in court. [BUZZ] Catlett speaking. On all counts? Please be sure to congratulate Del. Tell him we're all very pleased. [BEEPING] Chris. Would you try to reach the president for me? Congratulations. Thank you. Thank you. Counselor. Good fight. -You too. Congratulations. Thank you. So drag him off on that cruise, huh? Oh, I'll try if he doesn't get another assignment. If he does, put strychnine in his beer. I'll handle the defense. Think they'll take you up on that, the Sanderson thing? I hope so. My bags are packed. If there's anything I can do, any buttons you need pressed. I may take you up on that. Thank you. We'll meet you outside. See you outside. [MUSIC PLAYING]
