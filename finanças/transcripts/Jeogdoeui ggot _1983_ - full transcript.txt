Flower on the Equator Ahn Sung-ki Chang Mi-hee Sin Il-ryong Na Young-hee Nam Koong Won It's me, your father. How are you? I'm fine. Tomorrow is my birthday. Will you come and visit me? I won't be there. I put some money in your bank account. Take it. While I do nothing, staying up all night, my family keeps on sending me money each month. There's no love in our family. Original novel & Screenplay Choi In-ho Last spring I resigned. I quit my fifth job at a company and made up my mind to never get another job again. I despise the people who are crazy for money and lust. Lighting Gang Sang-ryong I'd say I'm a stranger wandering around aimlessly, searching for pure beauty and love.

I have never seen such a beautiful woman. The lights at her room went off at 1 am. Some guy visited her at 8 pm. He left at 10 pm. The woman combed her hair. The lights of her room went off at midnight. Won't you invite me to your house? You're pretty happy, huh? I really envy you. Patients, antiseptic, night shifts... I'm sick and tired of all that. At least you do something for others. We shouldn't be living for others. Oh, it's been a while since you met your mother. Did you hear about her recently? You don't even know her new address? I can understand why you hate her. She met with a young guy right after your father passed away. But you should understand. How could a woman live by herself without having any money? Stop it! Here's your present. Your birthday present, Oh Seon-young. Thanks. You've liked shopping since you were a school girl. Oh, what's your new phone number? 542-4997. 542-4997. I wonder what kind of present he'll give you. I don't want anything expensive. I want some roses. As many as my age. 24 roses? Gosh, grow up. Roses? You're not a kid anymore. Just say that you want a pear shaped diamond, okay? I want to have a look. I don't want any money from him. Are you going to live like this for the rest of your life? You should take care of yourself. Try to take advantage of him before he dumps you. And then marry another nice guy. You're crazy. Hey, Seon-young. - I'm sorry.- No, it's okay. Happy 24th birthday, Seon-young. Mr. M... Mr. M... Hello. Hello, Seon-young. I want to meet you. Because I'm in love with you. Yes, hello. Hello? Are you Seol-hee? You're crazy. Don't fool around. I was actually just listening to the record you bought me. Hey, why aren't you saying anything? Hello. Hello? Hello! When are you coming back? I have to go to Japan tomorrow. For business. I want to go with you. I'll be back in a week. Am I supposed to take this? Isn't this what you wanted? I don't need it. I haven't even used up the money you gave me last month. You're such a frugal woman. Use as much of it as you want. Mr. Kim... Do you love me? Of course. Seon-young. There seems to be a present for you. I'll leave it here. I'm sending you the second present. I'll be watching you wear this clothes wherever you go. The advance ticket enclosed is for the Sleeping Beauty ballet. Mr. M. Oh my, are you angry again? Dad, why're you so late? Oh, I'm sorry. I was having diner with an attendant from the office. Why didn't you give me a call? I'm sorry, honey. I didn't have the time. Let's get inside. - Okay.- Let's go. Kim Seong-du Your love is such a foolish one. The guy has a family. The guy doesn't love you. He just wants your young body and pleasure. Seon-young. You shouldn't ever meet him again. Seon-young. Yes. Hello, Mr. M! Don't hang up. Are you dumb? Oh no... That's not it. Who are you then? Why are you calling me every night? As you say, I'm Mr. M. Is there such a last name as M in our country? Or are you from the US? How do you know my name? And my birthday? Why did you send me roses? And clothes? Because I'm in love with you. You're saying you love me? From when do you know me? Do you live in this apartment house? No, that's not true. What do you want from me? I want to meet you. Will you come to the ball? I want to meet you. That sounds good. I want to meet you, too. I'm curious, Mr. M. Thank you. Goodbye, Seon-young. Okay. You drank to much today. Yes, I'm drunk. I can't sleep if I don't drink. Each night I have trouble sleeping. Unless I take some sleeping pills... I can't get myself to sleep. Mr. M, are you listening to me? I'm listening. I was afraid that you would hang up on me. Have you ever talked to yourself, Mr. M? When I was young, I would sometimes talk to myself all night. People like us... need someone whose breath we can listen to, someone who we can share our thoughts with, rather than talking to ourselves. You said you love me, Mr. M? Yes, I love you. I'm in love with someone else. I know I have to break up with that guy. It's already going on like that for 3 years. That guy... was my boss in the company I joined after quitting college. It may be hard to believe but he was my first love. Mr. M, too boring for you, right? Have you ever tried to kill yourself, Mr. M? When I had to abort his baby, I took 20 sleeping pills. I already tried to kill myself twice. Do you know how many times I tried to break up with him? But... I was the one who begged him to meet with me again. It's funny, right? Are you listening? You should get some rest. I want to get some rest, too. Mr. M has three eyes and four legs. A monster. Mr. M... I bet you have very clear eyes. Mr. M... Mr. M... Mr... Kim Seong-du. Hello? - Is this Kim Seong-du's house? - Yes, it is. Are you his wife? Yes, who is this? I know Kim Seong-du very well. He's still busy at the office and hasn't come home yet. You're being deceived each night. Hello? What are you talking about? I feel displeased. It's not just you who feels displeased. I'm also feeling displeased. Mr. Kim Seong-du is currently at some secret place. He's a hypocrite and a liar. Your husband is currently at a secret place that no one knows, hugging a young woman. Not just tonight he's been doing that for 3 years now. If you don't believe me, you should go and see what lies in front of your entrance door. I tell you the phone number of the place he stays at. Hello. Is Mr. Kim Seong-du there? Hello? Is Mr. Kim Seong-du there? Hello? Hello? I'm asking if Mr. Kim Seong-du is there. Hello? Is Mr. Kim Seong-du there? Hello! Hello. Did you come alone? Where are you coming from? Oh! You're from Seoul? Y... Yes, that's right. I'm from Seoul, too.That's my hometown. Are y...you... stu...stuttering? Get up. Let's dance. I can't dance. Dancing is quite simple. It's just holding hands and twisting your waist. Let's go. Come on. You're such a boring man. Oh! If you're all right with it, how about going downtown? I know a great sashimi place. I don't eat sashimi. When are you going back to Seoul? Well... I'm leaving tomorrow. Farewell right after meeting you. Do you think we can meet again in Seoul? If you like, I can call you when I'm Seoul. Would that be okay? No. I guess you're already in love with someone else? I want to date you, Seon-young. Are you a pro? - What?- A playboy. People often tend to think that. But I'm far more innocent than my looks would suggest. Do you have a cigarette? What? Oh, I quit a month ago. I also have some candies. You want some? I'm in love. I've loved you since the moment I saw you. Would you want some juice? Or milk? Juice! Jun-hwan! Yes, did you call me? Do you love me? Yes, of course I love you. It's the first time I'm feeling this kind of love. Do you really love me? 137 Pyeongchang-dong, Jongno-gu Jung Jun-hwan Jung Jun-hwan. - Bye.- Okay. Hello, sir. Hello, sir. Did Mr. Kim call? Yes, he said he'll call at 3 pm. I think you're a playboy. Seon-young has chosen the wrong man. I knew it on the first sight. I liked you on the first sight. I'm not like Seon-young. Seon-young is a bit too much for me. I think she's like a dreaming kid, right? I love you. I loved you from the first moment on that I saw you. That won't work for me. Seol-hee, I want to check up on you. Are you sure? Do you think you can control me? I don't like guys without any temperament. You're already an hour late. Where are you now? This is Mr. M. Hey, Mr. M. I don't want to talk to you anymore. Don't call me again. If you should call me again, I'll call the cops. I have something to tell you. You go first. Don't you think her breasts are too small for a foreigner? Yes or no? Don't fool around with me. Oh, I am sorry. You must be tired. Not too much. Seon-young, it's me, Jun-hwan. Seon-young, it's me, Jun-hwan. I want you to come out. It's me, Jun-hwan. It's Jun-hwan. Hello? It's me, Jun-hwan. What? Who? Oh gosh, did you already forget my voice? Jun-hwan? Yes, it's me, Jun-hwan. Jun-hwan. You sound like you're very far away. Why haven't you called me for two days? I've spend a long time waiting for you. Oh, sorry. I've been very busy. Can you come out now? Where're you now? I'm at room 1006, Seoul hotel. Hello. You sound very strange. I want to see you. Will you come or not? Okay, I'm coming. I'll leave soon. Mr. M.... Hello. I'm sorry but... You want me to deliver these flowers? Yes. You shouldn't be doing this. Flowers are bad for the patient. How's her condition? Who're you talking about? A woman called Oh Seon-young. Here's no one with that name. - Did she leave the hospital? - What's your relation to her? He must have a crush on her. I'm her guardian. How can a guardian not just go into the room, but always asks us to deliver the flowers? - Where's the patient? - She moved to another room. What room is it? I'm very busy now. Check with the admin for that. - Why did she move? - She needed some psychiatric treatment. She was having a severe depression and was emotionally unstable. She might try to kill herself again. Hey, how about her health condition? Go check at the psychiatric ward. Gosh, the hospital is full because of those weird people! Nurse. What again? You should go that way to get to the psychiatric ward. Oh my... Mr. M. Mr. M. Mr. M! Congratulations for leaving the hospital, Seon-young. Yes. I'm Mr. M. Where are you? I'm near you. Please come to my house. It's too late now. This is my last invitation. I have to leave the apartment in several days. I have to leave to somewhere else. If you don't have the courage to come to my place, I'll turn all the lights off for you. Please come here, Mr. M. Seon-young. Are you still not used to darkness? I can see a little. Then sit down. There's a sofa if you move forward a bit. I know. Turn off the light. I almost broke our promise. Can I turn on the fireplace? I've got a cold. Go ahead. Do you want some alcohol? I don't drink alcohol. Can you dance? No. Can I turn on the lights, Mr. M? No. Just for a while. I'd like to see you clearly just for a while. I won't let you get away with it, if you turn on the lights. Forgive my rudeness. I've seen your face once. But it was so dim that it was like a misty illusion. Is that your face? Oh, that is boring. You're just like everyone. Two eyes, one nose. I thought you were a monster with three eyes and two noses. Don't you want to touch my face, Mr. M? You're drunk, Seon-young. You should get some rest. Please put me to bed. I'm dizzy. I think I'm tumbling down. Do you love me? You're my one and only, most precious and noble woman. Even if you know my dirty past? Your body may be dirty, but that doesn't mean that you're dirty on the inside. Your soul is very clean. Don't go, Mr. M! Do you know how much I awaited your visit? Do you know how much I wanted to see you? Please don't go... Don't go. Don't go. Please don't go. Don't go... You're my female soulmate. If anyone tries to harass you, I would never let him get away with it. I've really enjoyed tonight's invitation. Good night, Seon-young. I'm trying to forget everything now. I can forgive you now and you can also say that I've forgiven you. I'd like to start anew, to heal my wounds. I want to see you. Can you come to my place when you receive this letter? Don't call me. I don't want to hear your voice on the phone. Phones are just a tool to deliver simple messages. I'll be waiting for you. For your love, Oh Seon-young. Hello. It's been a while. Who are you? Oh god. Did you already forget my voice? What's up? I want to check on you. Isn't it about time? Don't joke around with me. Let's meet later, around 8 pm. Did you hear about Seon-young? Please don't mention her. She left the hospital. Did she have some kind of athlete's foot on her fingers or something? Or maybe appendicis? Something with her hair? Right? No? I'll see you at 8 pm in the hotel lobby. Hello. Jung Jun-hwan. I'll help you with that. - I'm al right. - Okay, enjoy your stay. What happened? I'm sorry, Seol-hee. I'll be there in about an hour. How can I wait here for an hour? That's why I've already booked a room. Go and wait on the room. I'll be there in an hour. The room number is 1010. I can't take this. Let's meet again later. It'll only take an hour. You can watch TV or maybe take a shower. No. I has been been far too long since we last saw each other? Right? I'll be there as soon as you have finished taking a shower. Make sure you wash your feet when you shower. Okay, just one hour. I can't wait any longer than that. Thanks. I'll make sure I'll be there in an hour. It's room 1010. There should be some drinks for you on the room. I don't want to meet you at your house. I want to meet you outside. What? Outside? It's raining heavily outside. I'm in a car. Oh, are you? I want to drive with you through the rain. Well, that's not a bad idea. Where should we meet? I'll be waiting at the back door of your apartment. It'll take 5 minutes. No. 10 minutes. I have to do my makeup to look pretty, right? I'll be waiting. This is too fast. Is someone following us or something? You look like an angry man, Mr. M. Are you angry because of me? Where are we going, Mr. M? We're going to the riverside. Is that somewhere far away? No, it's not. Scary thoughts keep coming to my mind. This night is so scary. Seems like this night is not going to end. Why did we come to this place, Mr. M? I love you, Mr. M. You should get out, Seon-young. Are you saying we should have sex in the rain or something? Get out, Seon-young. Why do you keep saying I should get out? Someone is waiting for you. Someone is waiting for me? Who? Mr. M is waiting for you. Mr. M? Please don't fool me. I'm not Mr. M. Mr. M, you're weird. Did you bring me here to push me in the river? To clean your dirty body. Take your clothes off! I know it. I know you wrote a letter to him, in order to test me. Nothing happened between him and me last night. Trust me. You deceived me. You said you loved me. You asked me not to dump you. You said the same thing to Kim Seong-du, and also to Jung Jun-hwan. No, to all the other guys you met. You're trash! Don't pretend to be a clean man. I am a dirty woman as you say! But I thought you'd take me as I am and cleanse me. There's no love in this world! Stop this craziness, Mr. M. Let's go back to my place and start all over again. Let's go home. Why can't you? You're a coward, peaking at someone else's bathroom through a hole. Wash your dirty, corrupted body. Wash off your dirty desires! Wash your corrupted body! Wash your dirty desires! Hey... Her dead body was found two days after that night. It turned out she had gassed herself to death. As she shouted out that night, maybe there's no eternal love in this world that I was looking for so long. My love that I gave to her may have also been a selfish love, rooted in my dirty desire. I was hypocritical towards her and a coward who left her alone in the rain by the riverside. I've realized now. I couldn't save her wounded soul and it was me who made her kill herself. I'd like to live the rest of my life as a prisoner and beg her to accept my apology for causing her death. Seon-young was, after all, a vain flower that I tried to make bloom in this bleak desert.
