Karim! Karim! What!? I'm on a mine, damn the day, I'm gonna die. Hurry up. Easy. Is it finished? Karim, my friend, you should have been living well with your relatives in Germany, but you are here, messing around all these minefields. Maybe, but maybe it's better this way. Better, my eye! Better, my eye! Who's to know what's better. Here in Bosnia, at least mines lie still. I read a paper, back at the time of the "Desert Storm", that in Iraq, mines move through the sand, up to a kilometer from where Americans had planted them. They call them "smart mines". What do they call them? Smart mines... Hear that: "smart mines"... All mines are stupid, but they must be going bonkers from all the heat. And then wander around... You know, there even the dead do not lie in their tombs in one place, but wander around below the sand. The Americans planted the mines to get even their dead ancestors... I don't get it. I've had it up to here, to tell you the truth. Screw the mines an' all, why should I risk my life. It's better to steal than messing around in these minefields. You could stop by my place tomorrow. It's Eid. I'm not much into that stuff, my folks never even celebrated it... Did I tell you this one: "A peasant comes across a mine and asks: "will (loc: bush) you explode?" (I'll boom (bum)! "I'd sworn, right there in the cinema When grown up I'll be a miner?" "I'd sworn, right there in the cinema When grown up I'll be a miner?" - Salaam aleikum. - Aleikum salaam. - Bayram m'barak olsun! - Allah rasoulsum. - Salaam aleikum. Bayram m'barak olsun! - Aleikum salaam. Allah rasoulsum to you too. How are you, Dzemila, what?s up? Nothing really, am studying for my exams. I have two more to take, so I study all the time. - And you, what's up with you? - Same old stuff I do. I am just preparing an exhibition, and I will invite you when it's ready. Good luck with it. I'll make some coffee. I hear you are going to Iraq... Well, I don't know. Probably. Everyone's going, the money's good. What's there for me to do here? Well, let me tell it to you straight, as a brother, it's better if you don't go. It's dangerous there now, why risk losing your head for nothing? As if our war was not enough! And you may regret it one day, that you chose the wrong side, against our brothers and for other people's interests. Yeah, let the Americans get their own nuts out of the fire, instead of conning desperate wretches like us. It's better like me: penniless, but at peace! Here you are. Please, help yourselves. Why did you bring out all this, you really shouldn't have? But good that you brought the tulumbas? I love tulumbas. I love tulumbas too... You know, I too hate this stuff that Bush does in Iraq. But what else to do! One should not take on the rich an' the strong. It's like in that fairy tale, "Emperor's New Clothes". The emperor is naked, but everyone pretends not to see. Karim, meet my new girlfriend. This is my buddy Karim. Ivana, pleased to meet you! I'm Karim. Bro, see how small the world is. Ivana is a colleague of yours, She studies psychology, and you - philosophy. Same shit. Come in, we don't mind. You're my buddy. I don't mind either. If you're Juka's buddy, you're mine, too. Ain't that so, Juka? Look at all that beauty, and lo: beneath, landmines everywhere. - I wouldn't quite agree with you - How so? Imagine there were no mines, all the beauty would be unreal. My Karim, you are some mix: a deminer and a philosopher. You should write a book. No, it's not that, but all my life I did everything wrong, and then I figured I need a job where I can err only once. I am scared! What are you scared of, of these Karim's landmines? Of Iraq. Here, I wasn't afraid of anything, not in the war and not now, but this Iraq... I don't know what to think. Screw it, there's no more money here. Still a lot of landmines, but no money. And in Iraq, there are both mines and money. So take your pick. Much of a choice. With a house full of mouths to feed. You really gave up the job? Screw it, it wasn't for me. I have to find something better. And it is for me?! Landmines are for me? Buddy, you somehow dig it. And is anyone at work askin' for me? They are? In fact, no, everyone is miserable, we haven't been paid for three months, and we were promised... Oh yes, same old story... And what do you have in mind for a new job? I don't know, I'll find something, I guess? A kebab shop in Hrasno needs a worker at the grill. Yeah, I was born for grill work. There is always work if you want to work. But then, what are we doing tonight? What you mean tonight? Who will finance our entertainment tonight? I didn't get paid... - You don't expect me to be the donor...? - You're no use, either of you. Never mind, I have a plan. I know who'll pay for tonight's entertainment. - Who? - Who? The people will pay for our entertainment. Let's go! Fine, grab this! Let?s go! Ya know, let's take this money back. By Sharia Law a hand is loped off for this. Stop bullshitting, please! Didn't you say yourself once that imams stole the money from the people and that they deserve God's punishment? Ok, but it is not up to us to implement God's justice. Oh come on, cut the bullshit. What's gotten into you? Look here, was this money intended for building a mosque? Yes. Didn't your friend Mirza also say that a mosque is not mortar and stone, but the congregation, the people who pray there. Isn't that so? And we are the people and that mosque for which the money was intended and the money's ours. Let's take this money back, there's money in other places. Know what, Karim, don't spoil my fun now, please don't! Listen, let's do it this way, I personally will assume all responsibility for what we did on the Day of Judgment, is it cool? - Really?! - What an idiot. So Allah help me! So Allah help me and may Allah's curse descend upon me if I lie! Karim, relax, take this vegetarian smoke? Guys, what are we going to do tonite? Let's roll up for a bit, sing for a bit and then fuck for a bit! - Do you know what's tonight? - What? Tonight, the Mars in the night sky is visible to a naked eye in its full glory after thousands of years! What are you saying? How don't I know that, Mars is my planet! I am a Scorpio in the zodiac and I need the Mars tonight! All that's NASA's propaganda to keep us distracted, get to your senses. I'm going to take a leak, and you can philosophize all you want. And, so, Mars arrives tonight. Yes. Yes, we'll see it with a naked eye... We'll see it as a star... And what kind of planet exactly is Mars? Why the look! I'm not your Lottery prize. This is a free age for free girls. Don't jerk me around with your freedoms, Professor... Listen to you, one can't even talk to you. It's my turn in the shower, and you pull yourselves together a bit. Karim, have you been getting any lately? Not much, of late? What do you mean, not much, often, some, none!? Well, my friend, it's not the way to go, If you want to be my buddy, you have to keep up. And be more proactive tonight. Well, we'll see, perhaps if something comes along... You really made up your mind You're off to Iraq. I am. I don't know, bro. What the fuck will you do there? Wasn't there enough of our suffering. I would not go there for the world. Are you cold, my girlie? Huh? Wolfie, I am scared of you... Don't be mean, Wolfie! Karim. what a pussyful night! It's real hard once you realize you can't fuck them all, that?s real tough. That's the sign you became a mature man... Ships are sailing on the Miljacka River Is any called Zeljo, Zeljo, Zeljoooo... - Karim, sing for us one of your songs... one sevdah... - Which one? Wait, what's it called? "Snow fell on blossom and fruit, let everyone love whoever they want." You know, it is against Sharia that everyone makes love to whoever they want... There he goes again about Sharia. Let's hear our song... Which one? Here it is... This is music, not that what's-it-called - sevdah. All that sighing and whining... What is sevdah? Sevdah is... Screw you, you shit, let go, who are you pushing, I'll fucking show you... What is this! A gun, you know well, Munja, it's for protection. And what is this? Pot. And everyone?s got it. You aren't going to fuck me. over that, even little kids carry some these days?! You again. Why don't you calm down? Why should I calm down? The guy took a swing at me, should I let him kill me? You're a fast talker, Juka. But you're due for some rest. Same old... You guys always go for me. Thank you my friend. I worry about Juka, I don't know if they will let him go. Don't you worry about him, he'll be along soon. You and Juka are so different, and yet get along somehow? Me and Juka, we are an ideal couple... He is an obsessive neurotic, and I am hysterical. I don't get the difference? It is always too much for him, and too little for me. Pure physics, Karim... I hear it is always too little for women? I didn't mean just that. Juka is rough around the edges, but I do love him... Do you have a smoke... - Why don't you have a girlfriend? - I don't know. in fact, it is rare that one meets the right person at the right time... and when you are right, too, ya know? And how come that you and Juka are together? Listen to him, aren't you a bit jealous of Juka? You know, he is something like that animal with armor, a shell on the outside, and inside it is soft and vulnerable. - What are such animals called? - Mollusk. No, he's nothing so slimy, but you know what I mean... Somehow he fits me, with him I can be what I really am. - Where is Juka?! - Who? Where is Juka?! Where is Juka?! Who is this idiot? Where is Juka?! Take that piece of shit outside before I kill him... Karim, are you Ok, are you ok? My leg, get me my leg, please... Did you not answer my question. What question? What is sevdah? Sevdah is love, sevdah is suffering, sevdah is kahr, and in most cases it is unfulfilled yearning... Where did you get that? That was written by a wise man and I like it. Repeat it - so I can memorize it, too! Sevdah is love... Sevdah is love... Sevdah is suffering... Sevdah is suffering... Sevdah is kahr... Sevdah is kahr... What is kahr? Kahr... That is something hard to describe in words, almost like the cosmic grief merged with physical pain... Cosmic grief merged with physical pain... Nice. How does it go on? And in most cases sevdah is unfulfilled yearning! And in most cases sevdah is unfulfilled yearning... Nice, I like it... Yes, yes, Karim, you're a mystic. Or a fool! How did you lose your leg? In the war. We walked into a minefield. - Who did? - My father, mother sister and me... Mother was killed instantly, father lived, but passed away soon after the war... From the pain and grief... And I've got a small scar... And after my father's passing I decided to become a deminer. And what about your sister? She is alive and well, but keeps to herself, rarely leaves our house... Hardly even talks... Sometimes only to me. Is Mars there? It is not up yet, Karim, but we have a long night ahead. You know, I was not in the war, I don't know anything about it, but the war should be forgotten. I'd love to forget, I try, but only among the mines I forget everything. You know, I too have a childhood trauma. What trauma can you have? I dream of Wolfie. Wolfie, what Wolfie? Wolfie, the mascot of the Sarajevo Winter Olympics. When I was little, it was all over TV and commercials. And then, one night, he came to my dream, through my window. And you got scared?! Yes. And I got aroused. Aroused? What do you mean aroused? Here, between my legs, it would simply flow down my legs. Juka reminds me of Wolfie. Juka? Of Wolfie... It's a game of ours. My dear and esteemed brothers, we hear these days about the terrible evil suffered by our Moslem brother in Iraq, we are horrified by sights we see on TV daily, and we are witnesses that the world watches an great injustice with indifference. And they openly admit that difference between North Korea and Iraq is that Iraq is rich in oil! They openly admit that the war they started is a shameless raid for plunder! But, as one of their presidents one of the few that were any good, so they killed him Kennedy said: Ask not when Isa a. s. would descend to the Earth again, but ask yourself what you did to prepare for his second coming! Let everyone kill the Devil in their hearts and make room for the coming of Iman Maahdi. You see, this lehwa has three dimensions? - Salaam alaikum! - Alaikumu salaam. Alaikumu salaam. You missed the prayer today. I could not come, I was working and Dzemila stopped by, so we? I am studying something about ancient Arab poetry, so I stopped by, Mirza knows a lot about it. I'm going go? You don't need to go. We don't mind you. I was on my way out. Allahimanet. Allahimanet. What are your news? When do you leave for Iraq? Soon. I'm definitely in the group. Really?! They said on TV that Iraqi weapons of mass destruction have not been found yet. Ostensibly, they need more time. What hypocrisy! First they punish you for a crime, and then look for evidence that it was committed. What barbarians they are! Well, you're now in their service. As Bush says, freedom is not just America's gift to the people of Iraq, it is God's gift to Humanity! I see you have some new pieces. I have worked a lot lately. Have you heard about the burglary? What burglary? The other night the door was kicked in and someone came. - And did they take anything? - There was no money. But they took some of my lehvas, one of which I particularly cared for. Do you know who it was? What does the police say? The police have no clue. But Allah does. Hey, here's Karim. Come in. This is Maja. This is Karim. - What are you two doing? - Taping ourselves for YouTube. "YouTube", I don't get it... We're taping ourselves for YouTube. We're making the Clip of the Month. We dance, tape and upload to YouTube. We are great stars of YouTube. I mean our butts? You don't get it, this is the 21st century, now everything is virtual. Even love. - Is Juka around? - He's not back yet. But I am used to his "forces absences". And you? What are you doing? Well, I thought you and I, we could go for an outing! Were you here in the field during the war as well? Yes, I was. I hope you have no bad memories from these parts. Look, it's beautiful! We're Leaving the bikes here! Why? It's mined further on. Mined?! Don't be afraid, if anyone knows about mines, it's me. Watch the wire... Give your hand, mind the wire... just so... Good... This is for your mines! Do you know what the first man said to the first woman when he first saw her? Something along the lines: "What's for lunch?" No. No. What did he tell her? "Here are the bones of my bones and the flesh of my flesh." And do you know what's below us? Somebody's bones? What? Landmines! I don't get it, what landmines, what explosives and weapons? From the war. Juka and I hid our war-time weapons here. These are our memories. They hold us together. Juka! You're back!? Good evening. Where were you? We went for an outing, to the mountain. And did fresh mountain air agree with you? Come on, Red Riding Hood, talk to your Wolfie. What's wrong with you? We went for an outing. Are you jealous or what? You really are insane. Your buddy's in the dock, and you're doing his girlfriend... Karim, tell me about the attraction of mountain-climbing? It's about pushing boundaries, isn't it? About conquering new territories, new peaks, peaks you never reached before, isn't it, Karim? To climb the peaks which only a few can reach, isn't that so? But what happens if it might be foreign territory? If it is might be foreign territory? Ok, now we do thing differently? Karim, you're a better Muslim than me, tell me what is the proper Sharia punishment for fornication for a single man? Hear what I'm asking, what is the proper Sharia punishment for fornication for a single man? - Ninety lashes. - I can hear you, Karim! - Ninety lashes! - Ninety lashes. So don't take this personally, because this slut isn?t worth the quarrel between us, is she? I am only executing God's will, doing you a favor, you know you deserved this, ain't it so? Tell me now, was she worth it? That was not fornication for me. Tel me, Karim, why did you get into this mess? What did you get into this? Let me tell you why. Not for this slut here, but because you want to be Juka, you want to be me, Karim. But you can't, you don't have the balls for it. Let him be, Juka. I wanted to be with him. Shut up! You cheating slut! Juka, don't beat her, it's my fault, I screwed up. You screwed up! And you have the cheek to tell me that now! I screwed up. I deserve that you do whatever you want to me, but leave her alone. Shut the fuck up! Please tell me why a man errs... I want you to give a philosophical explanation, why a man errs?! Leave him alone! What are you imagining, that you are like your commander Juka. You will never be like the legendary commander Juka. Now we'll see who Juka is! Who is Juka? I can't hear you, who is Juka? Who do you love more than all the world? - You? - Who? I love you more than the world. All right from the start! Commander Juka, I love you more than the world. You love me, you slut! You love me! You slut! - You're only my slave. Aren't you? - Yes. - Aren't you?! - Yes! What are you? What are you? I am your slave! - Whose slave are you? - Yours! - Whose? - Wolfie's slave! - Who do you love more than the world, say it! - You, Wolfie, you! Karim? Brother, what happened? You missed the evening prayer these last few days? Something I cannot make it on time, so I pray on my own... What's that on your face? It's nothing. Some local bullies came after me... Take care, Karim, these are bad times. Have you read the book I gave you? Yes, I did, I have brought it, in fact. Keep it, please, it was a gift. Did it teach you anything? Yes, sir. Yes, I remembered that Yusuf Daid: "To get to where you are not, you must take the road you are not on." That was meant for you to remember. - What's going on with you? - Nothing's going on. - Was this done by Mirza? - Yes, of course. What do you think? To me this looks God forbid, like some stylized crosses. Don't talk like that, where do you see crosses? In fact, you know, I think this is that empty cross waiting for the thirteenth disciple Sergio, who is to be crucified in place of Isa a.s. You spoke to us about him the other day... The thirteenth disciple! - Excuse me, gotta go to work. - Karim, take care. Look at this one, as if it was from the Second World War. Look at the carp. That one may be left over from the Turkish times! The Roman times, rather. ... Graeco-Roman. Imagine, when we get there, to Baghdad, we will be for the Arabs just like UNPROFOR guys were during the war in Bosnia. For two cans one can fuck any slut of your choice, buddy! Never mind the sluts, I don't care about that. What matters most: You have no expenses, nowhere to spend money, you put it away and count off the days. Then, you put your pile in your pocket, come back and what? You buy a shop, start a business and allahimanet demining. Just like that! Do you think we will all come back and be well heeled! Cheers! And what am I gonna hump there? You only think of yourselves... Forget about sex, they only care that you remove as many landmines as possible! And you don't mess with Americans, with them you must play fair. A buddy told me, in America, if you spill hot coffee on yourself, they'll pay you insurance for life! And here no one cares about war veterans. So, here you are, artists! What's up? Well, here we're squabbling whether chicks in Iraq are better, or our chicks here. What do you think? The chicks in Iraq? The chicks in Iraq are first-class, buddy. Just like hot chocolate with white cream on top. But I hear they're conservative, they fuck only their men. Come on Juka, don't spoil it for us! Don't you worry. If you don't find any, you can let Karim suck you off! Of course! Karim, give me a smoke! Here's a smoke, Juka, come on, leave the guy alone. No, I want it from Karim. Ivana said "hi". She said she missed you. Come on Juka. Hey, ya know what, you two resolve it between you, don't pester us with your fuckups. I don't give a fuck! I don't know anyone named Ivana. You don't know anyone named Ivana. No! "The myth of the devil" "In the Land of the Last Things" "Life is elsewhere" "Letters for Lu" "MUHAMMED A.S. I - II (I.Life II.Act)" "The curse of the Muslims" "Is there a God?" Dada, come on. They could've removed both her tonsils by now. ... And install a pacemaker. I heard they also pay child supplement. Then, with your four kids, you'll do well. Thank you, goodbye. That's it, bro! - What did he ask you? - Nothin' bit, standard stuff, like for the army, whether you like police, male shit like that. And what did you say? Nothin' really, just the standard lines, that seeing a cop gives you a sense of confidence and security, bullshit like that... - And something else is important to say. - What? You must say that you prefer American shit to Arab pie. Alright, Karim, we can see that you are reliable, capable and diligent. They say you are a good deminer. How come you are a deminer, although you were a student of philosophy? There was no other work, and I learnt about handling - mines in the war. - So I see, in the war. Ok, you know your mines, and what do you know about Iraq, about the crisis in Iraq and the role U.S. have in it? Well, I think that American brought freedom and democracy to the Iraqi people... Ok, Karim, and, what is for you this freedom that U.S. brought to the Iraqi people? Well, some theorists make a difference between formal and real freedom. Roughly, you are free, but on condition that you make the right choice, so it becomes an illusion of freedom. And Hegel wrote that there was no freedom without law. And for me personally, to be frank, God's law is the only legitimate law. Hegel. You are a believer? You attend prayers in a mosque? I am. Yes. You heard that a liberal democracy on the Western model is being introduced in Iraq. I wonder what is your view, as a believer, a Moslem, of impending establishment of liberal democracy in Iraq? I think that liberal democracy is one big lie. In Iraq, or anywhere else in the world! You know, I would not agree with you. What're you implying, that Saddam Hussein's regime was good? And do you think the regime in Israel is good? Do you think that the U.S. attacked Iraq to advance Iraqi's human rights? You know, we are the ones asking questions here. Is it... Well, here, America and Europe first punish the Iraqi people and then look for evidence of a crime, which they can't find. Why don't they mind that Kuwait and Saudi Arabia are non-democratic conservative monarchies. It is all about Iraqi oil... But, please, do you think... No, hear this. U.S. blocked an international agreement allowing poor countries to buy cheap medicines. And millions of the poor, millions, cannot get medicines against diseases such as AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis! What are we talking about here? What are we talking about?! - I beg your pardon. - No, I beg yours, what are we talking about?! Was it Reagan who wrote in a letter that he was sorry that he would not be the President of America when the final Armageddon happens in the Middle East? Yes, it was. And this war is certainly a preparation for the Armageddon! Only Reagan's successors will be on the other side un that battle! - Alpha One, come in, Alpha One. - Alpha One, receiving, all in order. Five deminers in five working tracks, - medical support available. - All's well. All's well. The guys are asking when we gonna be paid? Halo, halo... My brothers, if the rahmetli Adnan hurt anyone, - or left any debts, Shall we forgive him? - Halalosum. What happened? You messed up the interview? I knew nothing would come of it. And hey, I'm so sorry, pal! I thought you would be our man there, since your English's real good. Hi. What's up. Karim, let's forget everything. - I have a good deal for me and you. - What deal? To sell our war-time stocks. - What stocks? - The stuff in the mountain. There's a lot there, explosive, a few grenades, two Kalashnikov. Really, we don't need it, and the money's good. - And who's buying? - Those two. Are you crazy? What do you have to do with them? I've nothing to do with them, I don't give a fuck. I am only interested in business. You should be, too. Your buddies are off to Iraq, and you're out. And what do they want it for? I'm not a terrorist! Here, buyrum. I hear you're not going to Iraq after all?! Naah, no Iraq. I ain't on the list, I haven't passed the interview. Well, let me tell you, frankly, you're better off not going, why would you regret tomorrow for being on the wrong side. There are the news, turn the volume up a bit, please... Bosnia again. In the end, we will be responsible for everything... A fool picks up a weapon and all Moslems are immediately responsible. Then the West will react and we will suffer again. I no longer know what' right. This cannot be supported. This is violence, and violence, except for a defensive war, is violence. Regardless of who committed it. Christians or Moslems, I make no difference there and it has no effect. And do you think what Jan Palach had done had any effect? Jan Palach was not a Moslem. And suicide, that is a great sin... But I would like to have a serious conversation with you... Just talk, bro! I want to get married... with Dzemila! What does Dzemila say? She? She, I think, is willing. Alright, my brother! If it is so, may you both be happy! Juka, what are you doing? Karim, what do you want? Drop it. Come on, bury it back! What's up with you, are you out of your mind? Come on, bury it! Did you hear what I asked you? What so you want? This is mine, too. We buried this together. Bury it! This is ours, Karim! Just as Ivana was ours, not just mine. You dare raise your hand against me... Against me... Karim! Karim! Karim! Karim! You really won't come to our wedding. We'll have a good time, first we'll go to the tekke for the wedding then to the municipality, and then we'll sit down to feast and sing at my place. I told you before I can't go. You go, with my blessing. But Karim, I am your friend... And Dzemila would love it, too... Mirza, my brother-to-be, don't take it against me, but I can't. And as far as my sister is concerned, we two only know how. We go without each other. Very well, if that's what you want. Dzemila, have you packed all your stuff? - Just let me say goodbye to my brother... - All right, I'll wait for you outside. So, the time has come for you and me to part. - Your Mirza is nice... - So he is. He's a good friend of mine. He is your nafaqa. - He'll be good to you. - I think he will. And what would you do now... In an empty house. I don't know... I'll find something There must be something out there for me, too. Do you know this desert joke? Two tigers walk down the road when they see a lion with a great mane. Tigers flinched a bit, the lion is, after all, the king of beasts. The lion walked by calmly and they passed by him peacefully. When he passed, one tiger said to the other: "Look at that vahabist, where he thinks he's going?" Well, let's drink to our lucky departure to Iraq. It would've been better if we were going all together. - Karim too. - And our Juka. And Juka. And Adnan. Karim, here's that Ivana of yours. Hello. Juka's gone. I came to say goodbye. I?m not going anywhere. We are leaving. We enrolled into a graduate program in Vienna. Vienna is far away.
