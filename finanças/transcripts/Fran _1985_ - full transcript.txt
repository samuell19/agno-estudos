Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. Oh, sorry. Hello? Oh yeah, look, my phone's not working and I don't... Ray Carter. 17 Canning Street, Whitby. Yeah, thanks. Give us the book with you, love? Oh, sure. There you go. Hello? Yeah, but... No, but Ray always pays. Wouldn't the checks come from the bank? Yeah, thanks. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, hang on a second. Look, would you just mind buzzing off, mate? No, I didn't mean you. Go on, get out, you silly dag! All right, all right. No, I'm sorry, there's just someone here making a bloody idiot of himself. Well, how long will it take you? Ugh, well that's no good! No, but my husband's up north. It's his night for ringing. He'll go berserk. Yeah, all right, I'll ask him to check. Bye. Now, what's wrong, Superman? Pinched your phone box, have I? How about it? Gotta be joking! I'm not that desperate. Ugh, jerkoff. 7.40, thank you. Buongiorno, Nino. Ciao, Fran. Are you all right? Oh yeah, I'm all right, except for Loverboy out there. Do you know that guy? I never seen him before. You want me to punch him in the nose? No thanks, waste of good knuckles. He hurt you? No, he's all right, just a pain in the bum. Yeah, typical Australian. Hey, can I get a drink as well and pay you later? Sure, 50 cents and 50% interest. Oh, sure. - Fran! - What? Come here. I got something you really hate. Marge? Choccy bikkies. Oh yummy! Won't be a minute. Oh, you've been using bleach. What's wrong with it? Can't stand it. The standard issue in every institution I was ever in. Yeah? I don't mind it. Smells clean. Well, it won't last long. How'd you go? Oh, well! Oh no, I can't stand it, Marge. I gotta get some fresh air. - Aw, Fran! - Come and talk to me outside. And I know just how many biscuits are in that packet. Where was I? - Telecom. - Oh. Bloody men. What happened this time? Well, I'm in the phone box and this guy just pushes in, bold as brass, and starts rubbing me on the leg. I hope you belted him one. Well, he put the hard wood on me, and I told the little weed to piss off. I said, "Piss off, you little weed," and the poor Telecom man thought I meant him. A bit like Daniel in the lion's den, isn't it? What is? You walk down the street and it's like a bitch on heat. They come out of the woodwork. Are you taking the mickey outta me? Mm, just a bit. Fran, you should be more careful. There's some real maniacs around. I'm a big girl, Marge. Sometimes I wonder. Oh listen, I could teach Muhammad Ali a trick or two. You could, if you stayed below the belt. Oh Marge, that's really sick. It's funny, though. No, I'm used to it. Look, they've been following me since I was in primary school. Oh, get off the grass! Well, first form. I never even went to school dances. Too ugly. Oh, Marge, no, you're really pretty. You should just put your hair up a bit and line your eyes. Oh, what, to impress the kids? Well, I don't exactly get dressed up either. They still follow me round, though. You don't exactly dress like a nun! Look, it doesn't matter whether I'm wearing a scungy old pair of jeans or a jumper, or what, they still wanna stop and talk. You amaze me sometimes. Why? Well, it wouldn't have anything to do with your figure, would it? Well, you might not believe this, but it's not just that. Guys say it's my smile and that I'm friendly and polite. And Ray's away most of the time. Come on, Marge, it's not just sex. It's the company. Why don't you come out with me again sometime? It's too expensive. Not on Free Night, singles 28s and over. Mm, they buy you a drink and they want a bed for the night. Well? You don't take a punt, you can't bag a winner! We should go down and try the Blue Note. Mummy, Mummy, you've gotta come quick! One at a time. What's the matter, Cynth? Tommy kicked a ball into Old Pearce's car. And he's yelling at him. - Yeah. - Oh, gawd. He's a pain in the arse, isn't he? Yeah! One more word of cheek from you, you little bastard, and I call the cops! What's going on? This kid of yours, deliberately kicked his ball at my car! It went off the side of my boot! Tommy? It was an accident, Mum, honest. Come on, Mr. Pearce, they're only having a bit of fun. Bloody vandals. Don't you call my Tommy a vandal. No, it's not his fault. You don't look after your kids. Oh yeah, well then, how come I'm in the running for Mother of the Year again, eh? - Yeah! - Runner-up 1979, 1981. I might be the winner this year, eh, boys? - Yeah! - I'll vote for you. - So will I! - Me too! Good on ya! Don't get smart with me, young lady! I look after my kids. Oh, that's a joke! It's a wonder they even know who you are! Oh, of course, you'd know all about it. You don't have to have eyes in the back of your head. In the back of your head! You can't even pee around here without you taking notes! Little slut! It's a good job your husband doesn't know what goes on! Oh, well, you get all your little stories ready. Too bloody right, I will! You reckon he'd listen to you? Bloody nympho! Blokes coming and going all the time! Some of us have got friends. Slut! - We should get him! - Geoffrey. Hi Lis, how was school? Okay. Gotta bring the money tomorrow. What for? I told you, the excursion! Oh right. Huh, Old Pearce has been carrying on again, raving about Tommy wrecking his car. I didn't hurt his stupid car! I know you didn't! He's a beery old bugger. He's a mean man. He is a mean man. He makes up stories just so he can have something to gossip about. Hey, Lis, a funny thing happened to me when I was ringing up today. This creep that was hanging around, I told him to piss off, and the Telecom man thought I meant him. You gotta watch 'em! - What? - Boys. They started bothering you yet? No. You go behind the toilets and they reckon you're fair game. I wasn't much older than you. I put a new load on, Mum. I didn't know whether you wanted your new jeans done so I didn't switch it on yet. Oh yeah, okay. Good girl, love. Mummy, I'm hungry. Well, what do you fancy for tea, sweetie? Sghetti? Oh dear, I knew there was something I forgot at Nino's. Oh, Mummy. Well, what about your other favourite? What? Mr. Jones Chunky Beef? Oh no! Best beef in Australia! But, Mum, I hate that stuff. Well, I love it. You like it sometimes. Want me to get it started? Yes, please, love. Shall I do some peas, too? Yeah. - Mummy? - What. Can you say "I love ya, honey, but I just can't smile" without smiling? - Can I say it? - Just one tin? Yeah. Can I say it? I love ya, honey, but I just can't smile. Can you say it? I love ya, honey, but I just can't smile. I feel sick. You gotta eat it, Tom, it's perfectly good food. Do you want one of my sandwiches instead? What are they? Cheese and pickle. Yuck! Suit yourself. You're staying home tonight, aren't you, Mum? Yep, nowhere to go anyway. - All night? - Yeah, that's what I said. I hate doing that. What chance have we got of assault and attempted rape? Pretty shaky. Well, he wouldn't get bail, he'd be off the streets. It'd give us some time, delay whatever it is he's working on until they get a replacement. He obviously assaulted her. Yeah, but is Timms gonna back us up? I'll take care of that end. You and Tony bring in Everett. My pleasure. I want you back in the tunnel today. Well, I gotta see the parole officer. Come on, you two, it's late. Lisa, Tommy. Oh, but we're watching "Cop Shop". Can't we just see the end? Well, how about coming to bed with me? Yeah? You promise you won't move us later? Yeah, I promise. But you're pains in bed, the three of you, like little worms. I'm not, I always sleep straight, so there. And the next song is for Karen of Melway from Gary, who's stuck in Mount Walker, Karen, and is pining away for his lady love. He sends you his love and kisses and promises to hit the hotspots with you the next time he's in the big city. All of them. There you go, fellas. Thanks, mate, on ya. Hop onto this! Your tongue's hanging out. She wouldn't give you the time of day. That ain't what I want. There you go, Jim. Half a dozen stubbies, thanks, Ken. - The usual, love? - If they're cold, yeah. Can I buy you a beer, love? Oh, not tonight, thanks, sweetheart. They always say that. - 5.28 there, darl. - Keep the change. Cheers, thanks, I'll buy a battleship! Ah, Morrie, you dirty bugger! Come on, I was only having a bit of fun. Keep that up and I'm off. If he could keep anything up, it'd be a miracle. Don't worry, love, it's all in his head. I'm glad it's somewhere. Reckon he'd blow it next week. Don't knock it until you've tried it. Oh, shit. What a lovely surprise. You been trying to ring? Phone's been cut off. I rang Telecom, they said they never got your check. You okay? I'm great, Fran. It's you that's off. What's that supposed to mean? Christ, you come in here in the middle of the night and put on your big silent act. What's your problem? Where's the little princess been tonight, eh? I've been at the pub for five minutes, on my own, Ray. Don't tell me, you've been cooped up in here ever since I left, right? - Yeah, near enough. Two whole bloody months, you ask Marge. - That bitch! - Don't call her that. No wonder she got dumped. Who'd put up with her. - I will. I will! She stops me from going crazy. You're never here. But that suits you, doesn't it? I haven't been going out, Ray. I said I wouldn't and I haven't. No, you just brought your work home with ya, didn't ya! No! Been entertaining the boss after hours, Fran. David dropped in a couple of times when he was down. But he's down here negotiating contracts, Fran, and screwing my wife! And me, the poor stupid husband's the last one to know about it! He likes to talk to me, Ray! Some blokes will do anything for a screw. You bastard! Don't you kid me, you do it up north too! Come here, come here, come here! You listen to me, sweetheart. I work like a dog up there to keep you and your kids! My kids? My kids, you bastard! Cynthia's yours, she's your kid! Who'll know where any of your kids come from, Fran, huh? You bastard! Oh, geez! You bitch! I'll kill you, you bitch! - Stop it, Ray! - Kill ya! - Don't, Ray! - Bitch! Ray! Oh, you always have to belt me, don't you, Ray? Or screw me! Talk to me! Stick it! Slut! Ray! Ray, where are you going? Ray, don't leave me here. I'll go crazy on my own! Where are you going? As far away from you as I can get! Ray! Ray! - Mummy! Come back, please! Fran? Fran? You home? Fran? Fran... Did you hear? I reckon the whole street did. Oh, shit. Did someone up north dob you in? Good riddance to the lot of them. But I'm not like you, Marge. I gotta have a man around. He didn't care less about you. He wasn't a father to the kids. No, he didn't care. Apart from Cynthia, a bit. You think you can't manage on your own, but you do. How often was Ray here, three months of the year? He should have taken us with him. Oh, can't you just see it. You and Ray and all those single men. There would have been a bloody murder up there. I wanted to murder him when he was down here. Never did nothing with us, he just sat around and watched TV. If only Frank had done that. Just come home and watch TV sometimes. Maybe we should have moved here earlier. We could have done a swap. No thanks. No, I don't think even you would have kept him from going. He just didn't want a family. - You've done okay. - Yeah. With a lot of help from my friends. And so will you. You should be laughing! You're a lot better off than I was. You got this house, and the kids. Yeah, but I need more than just the kids to cuddle. Well, get yourself a dog. - Oh, Marge! - Oh, look I'm sorry, but it's just that you think men are the be-all and end-all and they're not! Yeah, but you... I really hate it, you know, when it's six o'clock and it's getting dark, and you close the curtains and there's nothing to look forward to. You think I'm hard. But you should know better than anyone. Odds on, they turn out no-hopers, so why bother? Oh, they're different before you marry 'em. They sure are. Ray never used to leave me alone for a minute. He used to call me his "little princess". He used to call me a frigid bitch. Oh, that was awful. Come over to my place. No, I just wanna stay here. You sure? Yeah, I'll be all right. Piece of piss. You'll be all right. Son of a bitch... Stuck out here. Bloody creep, pack of shit. 20 to 12:00 on 6PR, and you're listening to Bob Momo calling. What do you expect? I told you from the beginning. I said it over and over, I can't leave Janice. Not the way she is now. She just uses her illness to keep you for herself! No, it would kill her if she knew about us. Mummy... - Are you going? - The gas station. Mummy? Mandy's going ice-skating. I wanna go, too. Oh, get your hands off me! Stop bugging me and poking me, you little bitch! Get the doll off me! You're so bloody stupid! Just get it off me, go on, go on! I thought we could be different. Make it different. Lisa? Lisa, Mummy tried to hit me. Why? I don't know. She's really strange. Where's Mum? Shh! She's been drinking. Oh, no. You're my good kids. When's Daddy coming back? I don't know, love. But why didn't he come and see me, Mummy? Because your daddy's a selfish bastard who doesn't give a stuff about any of us. But why? I'm gonna get cleaned up. Hop up. You take that. Come down here for a week and you piss off when it bloody suits ya! You bastard, Ray! You jealous bastard! Well, I'm not gonna put up with it any more. You're not gonna keep me locked up here. I'm gonna have a good time! Oh, what are you following me round for, Cynth? Oh, sweetheart. I'm sorry, I just wanna be by myself for a little while, all right? That's it, finished! Don't! I'm making Cynthia a sandwich! I want one, too! I'll make you one in a minute! Don't! - Oh, shut up for Christ sake! Don't! Mum, Lisa's hitting me! He hit me first! Mummy, Lisa's hitting me. Oh, Tommy, please! She won't give me a sandwich! Just be good for Mummy! But, Mum! Tom, not today, don't ask me today! But I'm hungry. I wanna sandwich! Come on. Lisa, give Tom his sandwich. - But Mum- - Don't argue, I'm going out. - Can we come too? - Where are you going? Into town. - Can we come too? - No! You can give them their tea, Lisa, and then they can watch TV. Aren't you coming home tonight? Oh, for Christ sake, Tommy, yes I'm coming home! Please understand, I'll get over it. I've just gotta get out of here for a couple of hours. When will you be back? Oh, God, all these questions! Just stop it! It's driving me crazy! Stay there, Cynth! Depend how you cut 'em up. Ah, here's our mate. G'day, Hermes. Sorry I'm late. - Hermes. - Ah, that's all right. Your girlfriend's waiting for you. Looks like she's fallen of a Christmas tree. She's waiting for you to give her a light. Not worth the risk, mate, not worth the risk. - So how was your day? - Wasn't too bad. I sold two today. - Two? Yeah, I had to. I didn't sell any last week, none, and the boss was getting angry. Vodka and dry, please, love. Have one yourself. No, thanks. Not on duty. Go on, I won't tell if you don't. Sorry, that was vodka and what? Dry. Looks like you needed that. Oh, the old vodka does the trick. Yeah, know the feeling. Some people reckon it makes you sad. Or is that gin? Makes me feel happy. Real happy. Got a light? Oh. What are you knocking for? Want your mum. Mum, Lisa wants you. Hi, love, come in. Why didn't you come round the back? What's wrong? Mum's gone out and I'm supposed to get tea, but there's only a little bit of tuna left. Where's she gone? She just said she was going out. Tommy threw the Vegemite on the floor and he's in his room, and Cynthia's hiding in... There, there. It's all right, sweetheart. Come here. Why don't we go over and get Tommy and Cynthia, and you can all come and have tea with us, hm? Come on. Come on, just shut up. Enough of the singing. No, I wanna show you my death-defying feat. Good night! I wanna show you my death-defying feat. Sit there. - What? - And do this. That's it, I'm in the mood for this. Are you ready? Eh, eh, twinkle-toes, the car's over here. - Not bad, eh? - Yeah, wonderful. You should have seen us. We looked so cute in those little red satin dresses up to there. Yeah, I would have liked to have seen that, yeah. You will. And the nuns hated it, they hated it. - I'll bet. And we had these white frills underneath, and we used to waggle our tails like little rabbits! Hello, darling. She's going home alone. Is this your car? - Yeah. Did you leave the Rolls at home? Can't afford the payment. I'm gonna get a taxi. Here you go. You finished? Thank you! Do you live alone? Yep. And you? Well, most of the time. Have I told you I like ya? Er, you might have mentioned it. 'Bout 20 times. Don't you like it? It's okay, I s'pose. Geez, you're a cool customer. I'm gonna have to warm you up! Did you mean it? - Back stairs, come on. - Oh yeah? Come on, fruitcake. Oh, don't. You're a randy bugger! Come on. That's great. Come on. Come here. Come on. Fran, Fran, Fran, Fran, Fran! Yeah, yeah. I know. Seriously, seriously. What about the neighbours. Shh! Come on, Fran! Shut up, Fran. Hey, hey, hey, hey! Do you want a written invitation? Come in here. Come on! You're just so funny! You're funny. Fran. Fran! Hey, Fran! - Oh, Jeff. - Are you sure? Yeah, I remember. I remember you. What about the striptease? I didn't. Oh yeah. The customers loved it. - You're having me on. - I wouldn't! You've been very good to me. How's your head? It's okay. I don't get hangovers much. I'll cook you some breakfast. Oh, I could bite the crutch off a live flying pigeon. There's an old chick in the fridge. Oh, geez, it's bright in here, isn't it? Do you work in that bar full-time? Nah, I'm just helping out, really. Don't know how long I'll stand it. Why? I don't like the big smoke. Do you like it up north better? Yeah. Yeah, I've always wanted to go there. Don't you even want a bit of toast? Oh, yeah. I'll get it. What do you do up there? Ah, a bit of everything, really. Mining, pubs, jack-a-rooing. I did some prospecting. - Yeah? - Yeah. I like gettin' out on my own, ya know? Oh, do ya? You know, I'm just the opposite. Got any jam? Nah, I haven't bothered. You lived up there long? Oh, what, since I took off from home at 15. Yeah? That's when I started too. Oh, running away, I mean. My old man gave me the shit. He was always after me, you know? Do this, do that. Yeah. Mine reckoned I should bow and scrape to 'em 'cause they took me in. - What, did- Oh, I got fostered out a lot. Well, what happened to your real parents? They put me mum away when I was five. She was an alchy. Oh, geez. But no old man? Well, she couldn't have done it by herself. No, I never knew who he was. Always plenty of uncles around, but... Oh, yeah. How do you know all them songs? Dancing classes. We learned all these routines. The bunny dresses, eh? How'd? That's when you did your strip. You're a liar! I'm not. No, you were really great. What! You're a tease. You are! How'd you get the black eye, tough-nut? Like this. No! Give me my dominoes back! I don't care about your stupid dominoes. Cynthia! Mum! Mum! Cynthia stole my dominoes again! I know, I know. Cynthia, how many times do I have to tell you, leave Tony's things alone. I'll never be able to find 'em all now. You're gonna pick up every one of those dominoes, and put them back on the board. You can wipe that look off your face right now. You're gonna do it, young monkey, or you'll get a good thump. I mean that! But I didn't do anything, Mummy. I know. Just leave her alone today, all right? I want my dominoes! Oh, Tony, please be a good boy. Just do what I say. Not fair. - Hello, Tony. - Who's that? This is my friend, Jeff. Is Marge home? - Yeah. This is Marge's son, Tony. - G'day. - Hello. See ya! - Fran. - Hi! Here you are. This is Jeff. He's been looking after me. He's been fantastic. - Pleased to meet you. - Hello. Oh, Fran, I've been really worried about you. Oh, Marge, that's sweet. But I've been fine. Jeff's been treating me like a real queen. Well, where have you been? You never even told me you were going. Oh, yeah. I know I should've come and seen you. But I was so upset. Well, I'm about ready for the funny farm myself. Actually, Fran, I better be going. Oh, do you have to? Yeah, well, I gotta meet a mate and then I gotta work, so... But you're coming back? I don't finish till one o'clock. Well, that's okay. I'll wait up for you. - See you. - Bye. Well, what do you think? He's a real spunk, isn't he? Oh, Christ, Fran! It's been three days! Well, I didn't mean to stay away that long. You can't just take off without telling the kids. Well, I thought you'd look after 'em. Of course I looked after them! Poor little buggers didn't know what was going on. Well, I was gonna come straight back. I didn't know I'd meet Jeff. Who gives a stuff about bloody Jeff! What about your kids? Marge, you know how I get when I'm upset and that I can't think straight. Well, I'm telling you, Fran, you can't expect me to pick up the pieces every time you get upset. You didn't even ask if I'd look after them. I can't afford it. You know that! I ended up having to go begging to the welfare. What'd you tell 'em? I didn't dob you in. Well, I've already got a file on me this thick. I could be in trouble myself for lying to them. So what'd you tell 'em? I spun some yarn about a death in the family. Family? They know I haven't got a family! Let me finish. A foster family. You had to go and get help. I couldn't get hold of you, so they had to tide me over for a couple of days. They swallowed it. Oh, god, you're a better liar than me. I'm sorry, Marge. I didn't mean to make so much trouble. How are the kids? Tommy's been wetting his bed. Cynthia's been a real pain in the ass. But they're settled down. - Mum! Mum! - Hello, love. We didn't know when you'd come back. I know. Hi! Come and give us a cuddle. Aw, come on, Tommy, it's all right. That's my boy. Oh! Where have you been, Mum? Oh, I'll tell you all about it later. - Mummy! Mummy! - Here she is. Hello, Cyn. Kiss! Have you had a good time with Marge? - Yes. - Yeah. Have you been good kids? - Yeah, most of the time. - Uh-huh. Did you see Daddy? No, love, I didn't see Daddy. But, tell you what, why don't we go home and I'll tell you all about it there, eh? Okay. Aren't you gonna thank Marge for looking after you? - Thanks, Marge. - Thanks, Marge. That's okay, kids. You've been a good friend to look after us. My pleasure, I'm sure. Will you bring my puzzle over? Yeah. Thanks, Marge. It's OK. Ah! Can I have the hat? - See ya. - Bye. So where've you been, Mum? Down south? Down south? No, take a bag. No, Cynth, I haven't. I've met this really nice man called Jeff. Jeff who? I don't know. But he's been looking after Mummy while she's been upset. Come on, kids. Is he coming to stay with us? Yeah, but not all the time. I know you'll like him, Lis. He looks like John Travolta. - John Travolta? - I like John Travolta. - John Travolta, you do not! - I do so! He's the Fonz. That's Henry Winkler, you meathead! Oh, not again. Jesus Christ. I'll go and see. It's bird, it's a plane, it's Superman! You have to be like the now! What do think you're... Listen! Hey! - You're a ghost! - Tom! Shh! Now listen, Jeff's gotta get some more sleep. He's working late shift. Are you laughing at me? You little brats shut up! Tee-hee-hee-hee! Sorry. Sorry. What in the hell are they up to this time? They were trying to fly. Oh, god, I'll make 'em fly all right, a boot in the ass. Every bloody night I'm here, it's the same. It's not because of you. Oh Christ, do you mean they're like this all the time? They're just being kids. You only see what you wanna see. Shh! Give 'em time. They like you. Oh bloody hell! Happy family. Jesus. Cyn! Cynthia! - Hey Cynth! - What? - Come here for a while. - Why? I'll give you something to eat. Your mum's gone out for a bit. - Where has she gone? - Not far. - Hi, Mum. - Hello, love. - Here you go, mate. - Cheers, mate. This'll go down a treat. Pretty quiet in here today. Yeah, the talent normally arrives about 5:30. Oh, great. We'll be back later then. - Hot to trot, boys. - No worries. Hi. Hi. I haven't seen you for ages. Two nights. Well, I miss ya. I've been busy. I spoke to the kids. They won't do it again. Really? Marge is babysitting tonight. Let's go out and have some fun. Tonight's your early night off, isn't it? Mm-hm. We can sleep at your place. Yeah, okay. Vodka and dry, was it, love? - Oh! - Raving- What's wrong with that? I hit it. Can. t you repeat it? What a lovely shot, darling. She drives like that, too. Here, duck! Quack, quack, quack! When it's just me and the kids by ourselves, we never have anything fancy. Lisa's gonna be a better cook than me. She's fussy about getting things right, aren't ya, Lis? That your homework? No, I've done that. I'm just doing this 'cause I like it. I don't mind spending time cooking if someone's gonna appreciate it. Do you like to draw, do you? She's a great drawer. It's not drawing, it's colouring. It's quite hard to do properly. Oh. It looks pretty good to me. Yeah, my teacher said that I've got good colour cor... Colour sense. Lisa's good at everything. Mum! She's top of her class. School's always been a breeze, hasn't it, Lis? There's no point in being shy if you wanna go places, you know. I don't know where she gets it from. Not from her father, that's for sure. She says to me, "Mum!" in that voice of hers, and I know I'm in trouble about something. I used to be just like her as a kid. - As pretty? - Yeah. Except we used to have to get everything right and keep everything spic and span or we'd cop it. Lisa just does it 'cause she's a good kid, huh? - Mm-hm. - Muah! Oh, Fran. Fran! If he wants to live with you, he'll have to cough up. Hm, but he's gonna keep the flat on for a while, so he wouldn't have enough. Talk about hedging your bets. What do you mean? Either Jeff comes good, or you've gotta get on the pension. They'll make me get rid of him. If he's not gonna support you, what choice have you got? Just take the rest. Maybe I could say he's my long lost brother. The one you never knew you had? No, the one my mother had, thanks very much. If I said he was my long lost brother, they'd have to put me back on the invalid pension 'cause I'd be cracking up. 70 dollars 20, please. Marge, can you lend me six bucks? No! Not till I know what mine is. Sorry. My friend's gonna make up the difference. 63.45 please. Your mother must've touched a Chinaman. Marcy, can you check the price of the Diet Coke please? There. Can you give me another, friend? Ride on, Jane. She's already nicked six bucks off me. Hope you're not charging her interest. - Hey! - Getting some money, Marge? - Oh. - See ya! Bye! Not if I see you first. It was only 'cause I didn't get to the bank. What are you gonna do next week? It wouldn't even touch the repayments on the furniture. The pension. Well, give some of the stuff back then. Oh, why should I? It's Ray that shot through. He's hardly gonna stand up in the middle of Melbourne or Sydney or wherever he is and call out, "Yoo-hoo, here I am! Come and get me." Well, I could track him down. Look, why don't we go through the bills together? It's probably not as bad as you think. It'll be worse. When Frank left, I didn't know the first thing about money either. Geez, you're smarter than me. Except when it comes to makin' up your face. You still gonna help me then? Yeah, where's your stuff? You see what I've done with your eyes? Put that bottom line right up to the edge. Looks really good. - Hmm. - What do you reckon? Hmm! Hmm! What do you think I'd look like with short hair? Oh, don't you dare. You'd hate it. Every time they put me back in an institution, they used to give me a bowl cut over me ears. Didn't give a shit how stupid I looked. Hm, what do you reckon? Joan Collins, eat your heart out! Don't. Don't! Sorry, I'm only teasing. What'd you wake me up for? I didn't! I don't know why I bloody stay. I do. One late shift, Fran. Jesus! If it's not your stupid bloody kids, it's you. We stay outta your way. Come off it, Fran! Every time I turn round, you're there, waitin' for me. You used to like it. It puts me off having the kids around all the time. Oh, well I'd still be a virgin if that was my line. Jeff, I gotta work out about the money. I can't give you any more, Fran. - Yeah, I know, I know. - City rents are bloody hard. Well, why don't you give up the flat? Look, I told you. I haven't decided what I'm doing yet. Well, I don't know what to do. Why yes you do. I've had welfare telling me what to do all my life, and I'm buggered if social security's gonna start now. Look, look! I would really like to get some more sleep, okay? Well, they're not telling me how to run my life. Sister Frances has heard that Mr. McDonald is feeling little bit grumpy this morning, and she wondered if there was anything she could do for him. Hi, hun. - Hi, Mum. Take the trolley back first, Tom. - See, Mummy? - What is it? - It's a present. - For me? Yeah, I made it at Ms. Jenkins' today. I did the bow. Clever girl. It's a tree. Aw, that's lovely. Thanks, Cynth. Show Jeff. Aw, it's great, isn't it? How was your day, Lis? - Okay. Oh, talk about a chatterbox. Tell Jeff what you did. Tom, the trolley. But I'll be late for Matthew's. Do as your mother says. No, I don't want to. - Do as you're told! - No! Don't talk to Jeff like that. He never does anything. Tommy! Wait till you get back! Little bastard. Oh, don't, Jeff. Please. Come on, Fran, you're too soft on him. Well, I'll talk to him. Talking, yeah, that's wonderful. A lotta good it'll do. He won't do it again. How about us girls take the trolley back, eh? - I wanna come! - All right. We can stop off at Helen's and you can see Claire. I don't really want to go. I've got things to do. Okay. See ya later. Off we go. See ya later, love. - Hi. - Hi! How's the board? Oh, neat. You're doing real good with that. Looks hard, but. It is. Thanks for making it for me. Yeah, that's no worries. I've got another joke for you. Yeah? What is it? What's black and white and red all over? Oh, that's easy. A newspaper. And a sun burnt zebra and a sun burnt magpie. Oh, cut it out, that's cheating! It's your turn now. Oh, um... Hey, hey, I know. What's red and green and goes around very, very fast? - What? - Kermit in a blender. Ugh! You're a good kid, Lisa. What's the matter, eh? Don't the boys do that at school, hm? Not in our class. Some of the older kids do, though. Oh yeah? Do you want a drink? I'm getting one. You've got a hard little tummy, Lisa. It'll go soft when you grow up. I'm getting a drink. I'm making Quik. I hate milk without anything in it, but I love it with Quik. I like Milo too, but not as much. She says she's an old friend of yours. Oh, tell him Fran Robinson. Sorry, Mike, it's Mrs. Robinson, not Carter. Okay. He says to go straight down. I'll show you. Fran, it's good to see you. Hi, Mike. Long time, no see. - Too long. - Yeah. Brought you some after dinner mints. - For me? - Yeah. How's the baby? Baby? She started school this year. God. You still in the same house? No, no, we moved outta that dump ages ago. - Huh. - Yeah. Ray got a job. Up north, and good money. - That's great. - Yeah. It's been a long battle. Want a cigarette? Nah, I'm trying to give them up. Geez, I'm not. Did you want to see me about anything in particular? Maybe I just dropped in to see my favourite social worker. I seem to remember you threatening to exterminate every welfare officer in the state. Yeah, well you were the only one worth two bob. - Ah. - Well, you were. I would've lost Lisa for good if it wasn't for you. You did your fair share of fighting too. How's Ray? Oh, he went mad and I shot him. Nah, I would have probably, if I'd had the chance. He pissed off months ago. You all right? Yeah. No more crackin' up. Tough as nails these days. - What about the kids? Well, Ray was never around that much anyway, you know? He used to pick on Tom and Lisa. Tom's father never came to see him? Nah. No hoper. Probably doing time somewhere. How are you managing financially? - Okay. - You're on the pension? Oh, Ray left a bit in the bank, you know. You know that time you got me that money? - The special needs grant? - Yeah. Yeah, but it's only for emergencies. But I got it for ages. That's 'cause you were in hospital for so long. Oh, great. You got a knife? I'll start a new pattern. You really feel it's an emergency? No, no, I was just wondering. Isn't the pension enough? I don't want them telling me how to live. Fran, you're not on it. I don't want them checking up on me all the time. You've got someone living with you. It's none of their business. Well, what are you gonna do? I'll survive. Well, I could organise a relief check. One? Nah, don't worry about it. I'll get outta your way now. See ya later, Mike. - See you soon. - Yeah. Mrs. Carter? Yeah? Wonder if I can have a word with you. Yeah, fire away. I'm from AFC, and we handle furnitureworlds accounts. Must be nice for you. Oh yeah, not too bad sometimes. Um, would you prefer we talk inside? Doesn't worry me. We know how hard it can be sometimes to keep up with payments. Oh yeah. I presume you received all our notices. Um, probably. You know, you're a hard lady to catch. I try to be. He's drawn up this pay chart, but I can't pay it. They could take me to court, I still can't pay. And I've tried my only good contact at the welfare and I'm not going to social security. What about Tommy and Jeff? What? Tom told us Jeff's been having a go at him. Well, I stopped him. I should hope so. I wouldn't let anyone belt my kids. Shouldn't think so, after all you've been through. Well, Jeff's dad use to belt him. So he doesn't get on with any of them? Yeah, I told you he gets on all right with Lisa. Well, one out of three. Oh, geez, you've never got a good thing to say about any man. I just don't see why you always bend over backwards for them. They won't stay if you don't. If he does stay, you're buggered, 'cause you won't get the pension. Well, I don't know what to do. I really don't! Look, if he's not here all the time, they can't say you're living together. Why not get around it like that? I want him to live with me. You can't afford to put it off much longer. They think they know a lot! They know nothing. They're determined to stand over me with a dictatorship. I tell you, they'll never beat me. Not in a thousand years. I won't be dictated to by the government. They're over the government, and the banks are over them. You're doing a lot of laughing. Who laughs last laughs loudest! You remember that. You support them! No exemption, cutting out all. Well, they can't get at me 'cause I know what's what. If you're eligible, you have to fill out the form and have an interview. I don't know if I'm eligible. I haven't got time to go through it now. Take this and wait for your number to be called. Next. Who needs the circus when you got places like this! I wanna sign up for the dole, thanks. - Yeah. Name? - Dorsey. Number 39. - I never got it. - Well, you must have. Check day was last Thursday. - And what's today? - Tuesday. I never got no check last week. You did. Here's the signature in the book. Well, I don't remember getting no check. Oh, I don't know. What do they expect me to live on? It's five days out. 41.41. No go, eh? Oh, no worries. Me rich uncle from Texas is gonna cark it. Oh yeah? Yeah, a little bird just told me. Had a call from an old boss last week. What old boss? From up north. Are you gonna go? Look, Fran, I'm not the right guy for you. What do you mean? I told you from the start, I'm not one for settling down. But you've had a good time, haven't you? Yeah. But you deserve someone better. Well, why do you want to go? What's wrong with me? Nothing. I just can't have kids. Rang back this morning and said I'd take it. I'll come, too. Just for a few days, just for a break. I haven't got anywhere to stay. We'll, find something. It's not that easy, Fran. I mean, some places only have single men's quarters and the pubs cost an arm and a leg. We can sleep in the back of the station waggon. No, no, the cops are touchy about that sort of thing. You can't just sleep anywhere. We'll think of something. - With the kids? - Yeah! The water in the gorge is that cold that if you had a bad heart, it'd be the end of ya. I'll still go in though, if it's a bit sunny. Don't! And some of the gorges are so deep that no one's ever, ever been to the bottom of em. Isn't that right, Jeff? - Hmph. Oh! It's gonna be such a good holiday. Boy, do I need it. Look. Oh, no, can't we go back? - Eh? - What? I forgot Luke Skywalker! Can't we go back? Was he in your second drawer on the right hand side underneath the jumpers? Yeah, but I want him. It's just as well you got a clever mum, isn't it? You're great! You're not dumping them here. Carol- You'll have to talk him round. Come on. Yeah, but isn't Graham supposed to be away midweek on the country run? Yeah, but he's been held up. He's probably going tomorrow. Hey, Mum, look at me! Oh, yeah, that's very good, Cynth. She can do a bit by herself, but I'm just helping her. Yeah, all right. I've got to go in. Pretend to be nice to the bastard. I'm making some coffee. You want one, Fran? Oh yeah, white thanks, Carol. I'll give you a hand. - Why should we- - Shh! That's right, drop everything for her again. Imagine him being here. A dead set asshole. Used to be on me like a rash a few years ago. Doesn't think much of you now. Hmph, and good reason for it, too. Really? She hasn't asked in ages. Look, we're not going back to when they just about lived here. She was between marriages with the two young children. Between marriages? How many blokes did she shack up with? The kids just got in the way. She nearly died that time! Oh, Fran's always been a bit of an actress. Just like Marilyn Monroe. Except she went all the way. Why are you so down on her? - Play up to him, please. - All right. Ian's got his own room now, Fran, so we don't have much space. Oh, no thanks. - Jeff? - Oh, thanks. You know, but they brought their blow up mattresses. They'll love it on the floor. Fran's been under a lot of strain lately. Fran's always got problems. I have not. Why don't you stick around and sort this one out instead of running out on your kids? I'm not. Geez, it's only for four days. Look, all I'm asking is for my foster sister to have my kids for a few days so I can have a holiday. She hasn't got family like us, Graham. I know, heard that one before. Oh, give us a break, Graham! All I'm saying is that you should settle down and think about your kids first, for once. My kids always come first. Oh yeah? How long was Lisa in that home? - Graham! - I was sick. You couldn't have managed to look after her then, Fran. Looks as though she's not managing too bloody well now either. I've managed for the past five years, and on my own most of the last two. I've managed. Oh please, all I need's a little break. I really don't mind. It'll be good for her. And who foots the bill? Us again, I suppose? Fran's gonna leave you some money. Yeah. You'd be away anyway, Graham. Aw, I don't care what you bloody do. But this is the last time, Carol. Thanks, Carol. Thanks a million. And look, they won't be any trouble, I promise. And I'll get the bus back on Friday. Lisa! Tommy! Come on, Cyn. - Coming! - Coming! Coming, Mum. Hey, now you be good kids for Mummy. Never worry, I'll look after them. Have a good holiday. I will, and I know you'll have a good holiday too. Don't forget the postcards. - Oh, what postcards? - Mum! I won't. You can get your nerves better. I'll have the bestest nerves in the whole of Australia when I get back. You're my good kids. See you soon. Wait a minute. - I'll take it off. - All right. What are we doing in the morning? I think It's an early morning for us then. Oh, what do you call it? The Heavens, Heavens using my parish. They must've hated it as much as we did, and they were big women, they were 15 stone And what did the other nuns do? Pray! Excuse me, please, I'm looking for a Mrs. Frances Carter. What do you want her for? Armed robbery with violence! Piss off, Jimmy! Is either of you Mrs. Carter? Well, now, that is the name me good father gave me, God bless him, though I never knew him. Hey, maybe it was an immaculate conception. Could I see you alone, Mrs. Carter? Oh, what for? Me and my friends are like this. I haven't got any secrets from them. Mrs. Carter, I'm from the Department of Community Welfare. I've been asked to tell you that your children have been in Department's care in Waigani for the past four weeks. No, no, hang on. My kids are with my foster sister. Apparently, they were reported as neglected. Bloody Graham! Oh, bastard! I knew you couldn't trust that bludger. Look, it was Graham Brooks, wasn't it? I'm sorry, Mrs. Carter. I've got nothing to do with the case. Oh, that's typical. You bastards know everything when it suits ya. I got a call from Perth tonight to ask me to come here and tell you. I don't know anymore than that. Four weeks? You've waited four bloody weeks? They couldn't locate you. Oh, tell me another one. The police have only just tracked you down. Oh, pigs! That is crap and you know it! You lot are better than bloodhounds when you wanna be. Welfare's tracked me down thousands of times. You just didn't this time 'cause you got my kids. You can get at me through my kids. They've always wanted to get my kids off me! You enjoy persecuting people, do you, mate? Yeah, well you bastards won't beat me. I'll get my kids back. Come on, Jeff, we gotta go. I'll be going. Hey, Fran, the man here says he's going. Oh yeah? Right, you get on that phone and you tell 'em down there to have my kids ready and waiting for me tomorrow. You bastards won't know what's hit ya! I'll rub your bloody noses in it, you creeps. She left her kids with her foster sister. The husband's a real shit. Jeff, are you coming? I'm not driving all night, Fran. In the morning, maybe. - No, now! Oh Graham, I'll kill you. Jeff! Carol, you bitch you! Jesus, Fran, we just got set up here. Look, welfare are not keeping my kids. Right, are you gonna come or not? They'll still be there tomorrow. They bloody well won't. Okay, take the keys and go then. Well, how are you gonna get down? Jerry's probably heading back, eh, Jerry? Yeah, tomorrow or next day. Soon. Yeah, all right. You wouldn't credit it, would ya? Sorry I've gotta go. See ya later, love. Oh, geez, this is a heavy bag. I don't have to prove anything. No, that's right. They're coming with me after school and you're not gonna stop me. And we don't want to stop you, but- No, but you'll have a good go, won't ya? God, if a mother's not home with her kids 24 hours a day, you reckon she's no good. Well, my kids like staying with other people. It's better than us getting on each other's nerves and me bashing 'em up like half the mothers around. Yeah, but that's normal, isn't it? And I'm meant to be the one that's no good. Mrs. Carter, if you'll just sit down for a moment, please, just for a moment. The time you spent away from your children isn't the issue. I'm sorry to have to tell you this, but it appears Lisa's been interfered with. What, Lisa? Oh, bullshit! What's more, we have reason to believe it was your de facto. Crap! Jeff wouldn't do a thing like that. What kind of crap are you gonna come up with next? Lisa brought it up, Mrs. Carter. You're disgusting, setting up my own daughter against me. We've had two psychologists interview her and they're convinced she's been sexually abused. Oh, Graham Brooks, that'd be right. Bloody creep! He tried it on me once and got his fingers burned. You ask Lisa about Graham. He's got nothing to do with it, Mrs. Carter. Oh, hasn't he? Hasn't he? Well, you ask my daughter. Has he told you what he gets up to on those country runs? He's got kids scattered all over the state! What we must do for Lisa's sake is work through the issue together. I'd never work with you lot! Once you get someone in your clutches, it's like a rabbit trap. You screwed up my whole life. You're not gonna get my kids. Mrs. Carter, if you'll just calm down for a moment, please, you're blowing this whole thing out of all proportion. - Me? Our only concern is for Lisa. We're not even talking about Tom or Cynthia. Right, so you're only after Lisa. We're not after Lisa. We just want to protect her. And I'm telling you, lady, you'll split up my kids over my dead body. That's not our intention at all, Mrs. Carter. Oh, the Department of Good Intentions. Lady, I lived with kids who didn't even know who their brothers and sisters were because you bastards had sent one here, one there. That doesn't happen anymore. We want Lisa to go home with you providing your de facto is not coming back to live with you. Oh, so that's your game, is it? If you want to see it that way. Well, you're not getting rid of Jeff. No way. I'll be back for my kids at three o'clock. We can't let Lisa go if Jeff's coming back! I know, I shouldn't have stayed so long. We were having such a good time. I just don't understand how you could put your kids on the line because of Jeff! I thought they were okay at Carol's. Oh, Christ, Fran! When are you going to grow up? They're not mine or Carol's or anyone else's. The kids are yours. You have to look after them yourself. Oh, god, I'm a rotten mother! Yeah. Yeah, in some ways you are. Don't say that. If you end up losing them, it'll be your own fault. Don't you start, Marge. There's times you're a terrific mum. It's the other times. Maybe I don't deserve to get them back. Does the department want to keep them? But you're their mum. You're the one they need, even if you are a bit hopeless. You just go walk about sometimes. And they cooked up this story about Lisa and Jeff. - What? They reckon he felt her up. You're joking. Would Jeff do a thing like that? Of course he wouldn't! If it'd be anyone, it'd be bloody Graham. Is that what Lisa said? Well, I haven't seen her yet. And you know about Graham. It's all bullshit. Lisa's never said anything to me about Jeff. You wouldn't want it to be true, Fran. They're not gonna take my kids. There she is. Mrs. Carter. Mrs. Carter! I'm Peter Cook, the cottage father from Yarrow. Where are my children? Cynthia and Lisa are inside, and Tom's down on the oval. Mrs. Carter, the superintendent wants to talk to you before you see the children. Well, I don't want to speak to her. Look, you have to see the superintendent first. That's normal procedure, is it? I'm sorry. Lisa can't go home with you. Why not? Department's lodged a care and protection order. She's remanded in our care until the hearing. You bastards! I'm sorry you had to find out like this. The superintendent would have told you, but you had to know before you saw Lisa. Take me to my kids. - Snap! - Cynthia! - That's not a snap. - It is so! - God, you're stupid. - Cynth. Lisa. Lisa, what in the hell have you told these people? They're gonna keep you here because of what you said. Do you hear me, Lisa? Do you see what you've done? What did they do? How did they make you say those things about Jeff? You said you liked him. Was it Graham, Lisa? Did he do something to you? What did Graham do, Lisa? Oh, Lisa. Oh, come here, Tommy. Come here. Aren't you gonna talk to me? These people here told Lisa to tell lies. That's why I'm upset. - You're always upset. - Tommy! You didn't send the postcards. Cynth, I did, I sent three. I sent a pelican one for you, Tommy, and I sent a shell one for Cynth, and I... They'll still be at Auntie Carol's. Uncle Graham got rid of us. I know he did, love. Mummy's very angry at him. I didn't like it there anyway. Sean is a bully and Ian's a dummy. Are you taking us home now, Mum? Please, Mum, don't leave us here. Ah, I wish I could, Tommy, but... See, they won't let Lisa come home yet. - Why not? - I'm going now! No, Cynth, listen. Listen. You wouldn't want your big sister to be here all by herself, would you? She'd be very, very lonely. Promise you won't leave us here? Yeah, I promise, Tommy. I promise I'll come and see you every day. Cross my heart and hope to die. May the force be with us, Tommy Skywalker, eh? I'm a big girl now, Mummy! I've got my own room. - Yeah? - Yeah. What about you, Lis? They've got big BMXs here. Yeah? Can you ride 'em? Yeah, wanna watch me? - Sure. - They race, Mum. Go like a rocket. - Come see my room first! - Okay. - Are you looking? - Yeah. Uncle Pete is really nice. I'd do a good job on full pay, too. Tell me about Graham, Lisa. Uncle Graham? Did he try any funny business? No. Are you telling me the truth? Yeah, he was away most of the time anyway. Cynthia and Tom acted up a lot when we first came here. Cynth cried all the time. But they got over it. Oh, sweetheart, I won't leave you again. Not ever. When you grow up, don't you let men get you into so much trouble. You don't want to end up like your mum. It's all right, Mum. Lis, Jeff didn't do anything, did he? They're lying, aren't they? Yes, Mum. Thanks for coming with me, Marge. I'm sorry I had a go at you earlier. You were just trying to straighten me out. It's a bit of an uphill battle. I've got to change. They're making Lisa a ward. Oh, Fran! So it's true about Jeff, then? No way. Lisa told me it was all a pack of lies. Well, what about the littlies? Can't you bring them home? I've got to keep them together. It's the only way I can beat 'em. But that's no fair on them. Well, I'm not leaving Lisa in there alone. It'll be the foot in the door for them to take her off me. They can't just be making it up, Fran. 'Course they can. They do what they like with you. I know them, Marge, you don't. Bloody welfare! - How do you know? We're downwind from 'em. Hello, Mrs. Carter. I'm Celly Espenal, from Lebrina DCW. What do you want? I've come to talk about Lisa and explain why the department's seeking a care and protection order. - Huh! - Mrs. Carter. Explain? I'm not thick. You wanna take my kids off me. No, not at all. Lisa should come home, but if your de facto is coming- You're bloody right he's coming back. You people still think you can order me around. Well, I'm not one of your wards anymore. Remember that! Mrs. Carter, your daughter's been sexually abused. Oh, balls! Lisa told me that was a pack of lies. Children often say what their parents want to hear. Oh, the Department of Good Intentions. You lot think you got all the answers, don't ya? Well, why don't you put Jeff behind bars if he's a pervert? We'd need additional proof before the police could prosecute. Which you haven't got, of course. It's very hard to get. Yeah, you haven't got a leg to stand on, sweetheart. The law makes sure we can protect Lisa, even if we can't charge Jeff. Look, Mrs. Carter, if Jeff did interfere with her, it's really important we work together on this to get Lisa through it unscarred. Unscarred? You people scarred her for life when you put her in that bloody foster home! She was only three. You gave your permission. - I never! - It's on your file. Do you think I would let my baby out to strangers after what I'd been through? I was never that crazy. Okay, Mrs. Carter, whatever you like. But here's a summons. You'll have to appear at the citing tomorrow. That's where a magistrate verifies that a child called Lisa exists and sets the date for the hearing. I don't give a stuff about your bit of paper! I'm at Lebrina if you want to contact. Yeah, well you lot won't know what's hit you when I've got finished with you! Bloody foster parents, they didn't give a shit about me. Those bloody institutions! I don't blame you for hating them. They've been spying on me ever since I got out of their clutches. You'd reckon I was a criminal or something. I know you've had a real hard life. Oh, you're supposed to be free when you're 18. Geez, that's a laugh. But Fran, what if Lisa's not telling you the truth? What if Lisa's what? Look, you don't know the first thing about Jeff. You don't know where he's come from, what he's really like. There's nothing wrong with Jeff. Oh! We're gonna get married. - You're not! - Yeah, we are. We talked about it. He'd still work up north sometimes. You must be insane! That's just like Ray. After this thing with Lisa, you can't. Jeff never did nothing to Lisa. How can you know? Oh, you're a sick as they are. You'd put your kids' lives at risk for some blowing, Christ, just so long as they're in pants. Hm, you're jealous. Oh, I wouldn't be in the mess you're in for the world! Yeah, well you reckon you're not interested in men, but actually men don't like you. If there was anyone decent who wanted something more than a quick screw, I might be interested. Men don't wanna just screw me! You're a faggot, Marge! Let's read this one. This one's better. - No, it's not. - Yes, it is! You have a look. You haven't seen this one before. Here, look. See! Look at Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker fighting. Look. Don't look at the back. That's just the stupid Muppets. Luke at Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker fighting. I'm just worried about Tommy. But lots of kids wet their beds. It's a stage. Lisa did it, Cynthia's never done it. He's not eating properly either. Well, I'll talk to him. I'll talk to him. Look, he's a sensitive kid. You can't just lock him up in a place like this. You're gonna end up like a broom and we'll have to turn you upside down and sweep the floor with you. He says he hates everything. Well what happened to old garbage guts? I wanna go home. What if we have a party when you all come home, eh? With ice cream and cake? Mm, yum! I don't want a party. You don't? Boy, you must be sick. Tommy. I hate me. Jeff? Oh shit, you gave me a fright. Fran, Fran, would you please just let me go? Why? 'Cause you're always grabbing at me, that's why. Why were you sneaking in? It's late. I didn't wanna wake you up. You said you'd come days ago. I've been alone. It's been awful. I got called on prospecting. I had to go to the bush with Jerry. I've been so lonely. They kept the kids. Jeff! Oh, Fran, would you just stop it! What's the matter? You're like a bloody octopus! Don't say that! You wanna suffocate a bloke. Jeff, but I love you. What have you done with my car keys? - No. - I gotta get back, Fran. I got another job coming up. - No, no! - Jesus, Fran! Will you just stop living in this dream world? But you said you'd marry me. Oh wait, wait, you did all the talking. It was all fixed up. Well you come up with these romantic fairy stories and I can't get a word in edgewise. You said we'd get married! I just don't want to talk about it anymore. Jeff, please don't. If you don't tell me where they are, I'm gonna turn this place upside down. I must be horrible. They're in my room. They said you did something to Lisa. That's bullshit! Sounds like Lisa's caught your habit of making up stories. I'll see you, Fran. I want you to come, too. They're really nice people, Cynth. Their house is right near the beach so you'll be able to go swimming all the time. And you'll be able to ride their little girl's bike. I'll be coming to see you. - When? - Every weekend. And you'll be able to come back and see me, too. We won't have to stay there long, will we? Only till Mum's better. When will she be better? - Soon. - Better be soon. Coming, ready or not. Wow! Little super dress. - I choosed it myself. - Yeah? Lisa's gonna come and see us at the weekend. Yeah, that'll be good, won't it? - Yeah. - Yep. We go to your rooms, pick up your things? - Yeah. - Yeah. These are hurting Cynth. You coming, Lis? Yeah, in a minute.
