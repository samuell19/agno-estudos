PALACE OF NATIONS. The Council meeting had just finished. The ministers and diplomats were milling about, talking seriously, looking competent, convinced of the importance of their fleeting business matters as well as of their own importance, all while exchanging in depth on pointless opinions. There's been progress since last year. This year is going to be critical and will mark a turning point in international politics. Absolutely. Solal, the tall, young and very handsome Under-Secretary-General of the League of Nations, was walking about, looking impassive, with a vast expanse of boredom and indifference in his eyes. The project we have just filed consists of getting rid of soldiers and cannons in toy shops. Let's disarm children. From a moral point of view, children are more important than their parents. They are the future! As the son of the magnificent Gamaliel Solal, the Chief Rabbi of the community of the seven Ionian Islands, who has his HQ at Cephalonia, Solal was a man without a first name. According to a tradition of the noble Solal family, the first-born is always called "Solal of the Solals". The League of Nations remains dedicated to its peace ideals. This year is going to be critical and will mark a turning point in international politics. He had been an attaché of the embassy, deputy, then minister of France. A Légion d'Honneur holder, he had become viceroy of the house of paper. For months, he had been a well-behaved, important and soulless man, who was bored to death and lived in dreams. He was brilliant in front of others, providing them with a perfect imitation of quick intelligence and sharp wit. But his wings had been clipped and he'd lost his real intelligence. He was scared to bite into anything new. He couldn't face suffering again, he was holding on to success. If he were to let himself live and love they would lock him up. Not being successful is sad. Being successful… is even sadder. What am I doing amidst all these political dummies? And, above all, the crime of being born Jewish. Of being born. No city in the world doesn't have the words "Death to the Jews" on its walls. Should I convert? If I did, I'd first need to remove a large part of my brain. I'd need to disguise myself as a member of society. To do what? Oh yes, to see Lord Galloway. In 2,000 years, what will remain from an interview with Lord Galloway? So, no Galloway. It's already been two years since I contacted Uncle Saltiel, or my cousins, Salomon, Michaël, Mattathias, Mangeclous. Should I get them to come? But if I do, in a few days there'll be cartoons in the anti-Semitic papers. "The Under-Secretary-General and his tribe." Sooner or later, my uncle on the island will find out. That cranky guy reads The Times. He'd find out that I am Under-Secretary-General. Yes, I should arrange for them to come… I can give them a mysterious rendez-vous. Uncle Saltiel had woken up early. Talkative and useless, perfectly good and very pious, he'd barely been successful in life. His brain had simmered with ingenious inventions that led him to financial ruin. He tried to make a living by engraving verses from the Book of Deuteronomy on chestnuts and chicken bones, armed with a magnifying glass. Lord… protect my nephew, my Sol, the son of my soul. I'm asking you to keep him in good health, to let him progress in his success, but always with righteousness and virtue. I recommend to You the French Republic and its president. A very good man, who is modest, reasonable and courteous. A man after my own kind. Lord, I also recommend to You my four cousins. The Jews of the world, the Catholics, the Protestants, and more generally the entire human race, except Adolf Hitler, unless he changes, thanks to Your will. But really, between You and me… I don't think it's possible after all, he has such a nasty voice. Mr. Saltiel! Mr. Saltiel! A certified letter, Mr. Saltiel! Pinhas Solal, known as "Mangeclous", a fake lawyer and non-qualified doctor, had just started his daily rounds collecting non-slander money. Mangeclous was nicknamed Captain of the Winds, because of a physiological characteristic that he was proud of. He suffered from tuberculosis, but was a tough lad, and his appetite was known all over the Orient, not to mention for his eloquence and for his love of money. He was called Mangeclous because, he alleged, to have eaten a dozen screws as a child to calm his unappeasable hunger. Long life and infinite happiness, Lord Messhullam! Oh charming notable… Oh open palms… Ah… Sultan oozing generousness. Give me the royalties for non-slander, in other words one drachma for this week. I'll agree to not say anything bad about you and your honourable family for seven days. I won't mention that your honourable wife was a woman of easy virtue, or that your beautiful girl has bad breath and that she therefore runs the risk of dying a virgin. Or that your cousin probably went bankrupt in Trieste and that no one knows why your grandfather didn't go to prison. - Oh, apricot water! - Merci. Lemonade with little lemons! Fresh water, fresh! Like gazelle eyes and the lips of Shulamit! Salomon Solal, the smallest and not the least sympathetic of the Solals, was a shoeshiner all year long, a seller of apricot water in summer, and of hot doughnuts in winter. As poor as he was honest, Salomon was an angel who always admired and respected, and was always dazzled and transported. …and the lips of Shulamit! Come and quench your thirst! One cent for the rich, and free for the poor! Oh, the apricot, oh! Salomon! My child and close friend. Ah, you're here? - Want a glass of apricot water? - No. - No, just your attention. - Happily. Listen, it's powerful news which is worthy of the afterlife! My heart trembles, I am so eager to hear the news. It's news which is too great for your small size. Call your friends. Mattathias! Michaël, Mangeclous! Mattathias, Michaël! Mangeclous! Mattathias, Michaël, Mangeclous! Mattathias, Michaël, Mangeclous! Mattathias, Michaël, Mangeclous! Mattathias Solal, known as "Chew-Resin", known as Captain of the Miserly, was master of the boat which carries the soda for the island's soap-makers. A hundred or so kids caught fish for him in exchange for a small salary, of marbles, matchsticks and crayons. He was cross-eyed as a result of looking for lost wallets in corners. Mattathias! Mangeclous! Michaël! Mattathias! Mangeclous! Michaël Solal, was Janissary of the warden of the Rabbi of Cephalonia. He was a great enjoyer of ladies and a terrible seducer. His handlebar mustache troubled the women of Cephalonia including, it had been said, the wife of the Greek prefect, who he would meet with in a cave on nights without a moon. Michaël! Mattathias! Mattathias! Mangeclous! Michaël! Mangeclous! Here I am! Who called? God Bless the newcomer! And the found! Greetings. Greetings and generosity, Mattathias. - Gentlemen. - May you live, Saltiel! Greetings and chastity, Michaël! Partners… I have called you here to tell you some news that will make each of your hairs dance an apoplectic dance. We're all deaf now, Moïse! Saltiel, Mangeclous, Salomon, Michaël and Mattathias, also known as the Valiant of France, belonged to a younger line of the Solals which, after five centuries of vagrancy, across various places in France, had installed itself in Cephalonia at the end of the 18th century. As Jews of the sun and of beautiful language, they were proud of having remained French citizens, who were loyal to the noble country and to its old language. Go on, speak Saltiel. Is there money in the letter? Tell us what's in it. If there's no profit, I'm leaving. Gentlemen… It's good news. Permission to speak! The honourable Saltiel just told us that it's good news. "Good", in my opinion, means "containing money", change, cash in bank notes from various banks. We must therefore celebrate the good news! Five litres of resinous wine, half a dozen nice thick boutargues, some olive oil and three loaves of spongy, oil-soaking bread! And may your mother be damned. Friends, dear friends… 300,000 drachma. Ouch! No bother! Dying for the motherland, is the most enviable of fates. Speak, beloved. Your friend, devoted to death and father of three young children living in poverty and starving of hunger. Not to mention the daughters, sadly alive and without a dowry… Your friend, your Mangeclous, listens to you with love. What else do you want me to say? The details of the 300,000 drachma! Well, here. Read the letter. "The sum must be split as follows: Seven tenths in equal parts, between Mattathias, Michaël, Salomon…" - Ah! - "…and Mangeclous". "And three tenths for Saltiel." - Give me my share! - Where's the money? Where did you put it? It's here. Look at that! Salomon! Salomon, Salomon… Wait, wait. Was there not another check? Who do you take me for? For an intelligent person, but I'm clearly mistaken. - You should be ashamed, Mangeclous. - Go home, nail clipping! How dare you speak with that drainpipe you use as your mouth? My mouth smells very nice. It smells of mimosas and of daisies. Your mouth means the end for flies: with one breath you kill them! This is how I reply, bait of falsehood! Bait in your sister's eye. Pork eater! - Get cancer immediately! - Nasty! Five years of bad luck for you! I wonder who has sent us this money. Maybe it's one of your ministers that you send advice to but who doesn't reply much? Maybe he followed your advice, and he sent you the money to thank you. Have you finished yet? Germ of the louse's thumb! Yes. I want to know, how will we divide our seven tenths into four parts? No, because… it's going to be impossible to divide, with decimal points and 33 drachma cents. But it's simple. The uncle will have his three tenths, you three, two tenths, and I, one tenth. One tenth of 300,000 drachma that's… 30,000 drachma! - I've never had so much. - Understood! Sold. Salomon promised. Our dear little hero, won't withdraw his suggestion, as it's a good one. Let's go gentlemen. Let's run to cash in the check, because our children… are dying! Patience! The check has to be cashed in in Athens. In that case I'll cash it in. I'll go alone. I'll devote myself to the task, I swear! I'll go this evening. Give it to the virtuous Mangeclous. I'll come with you. - Me too. - I'll come with you, Mangeclous. Ah… Yes, yes, yes! I'll come too. I don't trust you. There can't be too many of us watching you. - Salomon, come back! - No! Salomon… Come back, I forgive you. Come on. Oh! Gentlemen, it's the eve of our great fortune. There is here the secret of a treasure worth 303 million. For sure the treasure is in the lake! Especially since there are three exclamation marks after the word "lake". "Uret". What does "uret" mean? 204 + 200 = 100 + 50? What? 303 million. Victory! To work! Let's decipher this! - What does "water" mean? - Water of the lake! Why would anyone give us 300 million? Firstly, its 303 million. Secondly, be quiet. The sender knows certain things. But he needs the trickery of our minds, and keeps half the treasure to himself. But he doesn't know me, the moron. At the most I would give him three million as a tip. Not a cent more! That would make it 60 million for each of us. But you have the habit of taking less than us. If you're happy with 30,000 drachma, 30 million may well be enough for you! Not at all. - How repugnant… - Come on, friends. Let's decipher it. For the whole of the next night and the days after, the Valiants had no rest. They would sleep one hour or two before resuming their mysterious task. They barely ate, and had insomnia. Pale, defeated and lonely, they would walk with their head low. The population was persuaded that their great intelligence had led them to insanity 100… Plus 150… And with the rest… Saltiel made a vow to not leave his house until, at the very least, he'd discovered the secret of the 303 million. His head wrapped in damp cloths, and hounded by the madness which is conducive to genius, he worked on the mystery columns until, at last, they revealed their enigmatic depths. Gentlemen… While I was alone, like Moses surrounded by the surprised eagles of Sinai, I searched painfully and creatively and I found the secret of the secret. - The 300 millions. - Yet… the secret is childishly simple. Come on, tell us, Saltiel. Our stomachs are in a knot. Gentlemen… You should know that the other night, I was sleeping when I heard a voice calling me with a loud "pssst". I replied: "Who goes there?" "A friend" replied the voice. "Is it you, Lord Moses, our master?" The voice replied: "Not at all." "I am not Moses." "For a man like Saltiel, I come in person." In other words, my dear friends, it was the Everlasting himself. Oh! And God spoke to me in these terms: "Saltiel, I'm going to lend you a helping hand to decipher the enigma." "Be aware, friend…" - Is that exactly what he said, uncle? - Word of honor! And so, God told me that the enigma is easy and that my friends were stupid for not getting it. Oh, that's a bit heavy-handed. It's not difficult to find the answer when you're all-knowing. - Never mind! And? - Well, God… after running his hand over his beard… So you saw him? I heard the sound of his hair. By the hair of the Everlasting, hurry up. In short, you only had to take into account the letters and not take into account the numbers or the signs, or the word "francs". Read it for yourself. "Expose… this letter to heat… and uncle will have great joy." Where are the millions? I don't know. I was afraid to heat the letter by myself. I thought it best to wait until you were with me. And then… I wanted to suffer a bit. SALTIEL SHOULD… NIGHT ON THE… "Saltiel should be at… the Jardin anglais… in Geneva at midnight… on the 25th April." It's him, my loved ones. It's Solal. Uncle, you should be laughing, not crying. Yes, but what if it's not him? Problems with your nephew again. If it's not him, you might meet a rich, old American who you'll introduce me to and I'll marry bigamously. She'll adore me and I'll give you sorbets! Oh! Never do that again, because I might take your place, you rude person. Uncle, I've got a good feeling. You'll see him in Geneva, the Lord Solal. And you'll spend jammy days in that city which is one of the world's miracles. Rousseau's homeland, he who loved men. Since the 300,000 drachma have become interesting again, let's go to Athens to cash them! Yes, those millions made our heads spin. Let's hope the check isn't void. Gentlemen, after cashing the check in Athens, I'll go to Geneva alone, with the help of God. Who's talking about going alone? You should be ashamed, Saltiel. Do you think I'd let you go alone? I'll go with you, Saltiel! How could I leave you at your old age amongst all the hidden pitfalls, my good old companion Saltiel, my dear childhood friend who I wish to live and die beside? May these odious false friends, who are chained to the demons of egotism, leave you widowed and solitary. Whereas I will accompany you across earth and water, in wind and flame across deserts. I'll risk my life for you and defy pirates and ferocious beasts! I may be capable of fleecing you a bit, Saltiel, but I'd never abandon you. We are not odious. I too, uncle, will come with you. I'll travel over earth and water, winds and pirates! Plagiarist. How much is the journey to Geneva? Where is Uncle? What's wrong, Uncle? Are you ill? Dash it! When you're sad, you say it, you shout it. Enough riddles, Saltiel! Uncle, are you sad to have left the island? A quarter of a century earlier… 30,000 Jews lived in Cephalonia. Now there are only 15,000. The others are prospering in Milan, in Alexandria, Manchester, Paris, New York… All those defectors eat pork and only go to the synagogue on Yom Kippur. Our people are in agony. If Israel dies, I, Mangeclous, am living! For heaven's sake! Let's eat, gentlemen. Rich foods await us. Let's smarten up, the dining room is beautiful. We must look our best. Why stay in this cabin, when up there, there is music, first-class English to greet, people to meet! And ladies to look at. Electricity, Salomon! Turn the knobs! May joy enter our hearts and may I ruin this shipping company which is making too much profit! Come on. Come on… There. Saltiel, what is this shameless dance? It is that of an uncle filled with hope. An entire population of wicked. Millions and millions of wicked people, how is it possible? They love their leader, the one with a mustache who barks. They agree with him, because he's even more wicked than they are. Why do the other nations, who love their neighbor, not do anything to save their brothers from Germany? I don't understand. Me, I understand. They love their neighbor like the tiger loves a lamb chop. I long to see a Jewish battleship before I die that would bombard all of Germany. It's true, when I think of them, I become very bloodthirsty. And I, I'd be an admiral, with the shield of David embroidered on my hat. If I were the captain of a battleship, I wouldn't kill the Germans. I'd deprive them of all good things for five years. You're terrible. What do you think? They make me bloodthirsty. Well, nasty. When I think that the Minister of Foreign Affairs went on a fishing trip the same day that Germany remilitarised the Rhineland… What should he have done instead? Send a spy, act! Go to Berlin in person wearing a fake beard, create discord, I don't know! Uncle, you wouldn't go fishing, if you were the Minister. What do you expect, my son… People don't think I am capable. - Have a biscuit. - Thanks. Being a Minister… Signing important documents, pretending to be busy! And how I would watch the diplomatic bag. Here, Mangeclous. With one word I could make you a viscount. I'd rather be a baron. It's less frivolous. But whatever… Ultimately, I'm fairly communist. Me too, on the condition it does no harm to anyone. If communism takes a feather from a bird, or makes a child cry, I don't want it. But Uncle, at this precise moment, so many children and old people are suffering and dying. How is it possible? Men are born bad and society makes them worse. Why does God not intervene? He's lazy. You have to pray! To keep Him up-to-date? Does He not know everything? Maybe He's like the old servant that needs calling with the prayer bell? I don't like Him! I won't forgive Him for not existing. I swear He exists. Believe in God! The entire world knows He exists! It's us that told them and they believed us! Or God exists but is not good, since there is so much injustice. Or He's good, and so He doesn't exist. You won't go to Heaven! - So much the better. - How can you be good without God? We're only good without God. Is there any coffee left? Uncle, which one is the prettier? The blonde one, who smells of lilacs, or the brunette who is as fresh as cherries? I don't know why, but blondes always make me think of a well-browned mutton shoulder. Brunettes remind of a lovely fatty piece of oxtail with lots of pepper. As we can all see, you've never been in love. I've known it better than you have. She was very pretty and would recite poetry all the time. I've never been loved, being too small in size, but I'm sure that we've told each other poems. However, once the man is ill or weakened in a certain part of his body, they no longer recite poetry. What do they do, then? They put two fingers in their mouth. And they say to the servant: "Go on, look after that rotting carcass!" Yes, but you aren't ill, so how wonderful to have a woman reciting poems to you, how beautiful. And, how did your love story finish, Mangeclous? Very badly. I was 20 years old… and wasn't ugly. She was blonde with corkscrew curls. She would read me verses she'd written herself. About the lilies and the hollyhocks, the swans and the setting and rising sun! She would only say sublime words and always talked to me about oil paintings… by, you know, the old Italians. Raphael, the prince of Italian painters… That's worth a lot. One evening, I arrive unannounced. She can't see me. I hide behind a screen to surprise her. And then, that Madonna… And then? And then? She lets go a wind sequence that was like the trumpets of Judgement day. Oh, my dears, there were round ones, pointy ones and little ones, running after one another, quickly! And majestic ones that were very aromatic. You should be ashamed, you dark person. What shame is there in naming what the Eternal created? You can be incongruous too. This isn't the Parthenon and I don't claim I'm a thing of beauty! In fact, mine are a light breeze and wandering. Hers were thunderous. She wasn't a woman, she was a Japanese squadron. And why Japanese? For the beauty of things. In short, I left and never returned. My love had died, asphyxiated. But that's not the case with my wife. Oh my dear Rebecca, since she doesn't hide her wind, she's the greatest love of my life. But a woman with a nice dowry… And a woman's beautiful eyes are quite something, too! And when she sings in English, it's something of a lie. But it's you that's the liar. Me, I read a book, Karenina… and I found it very lovely. Two such poetic aristocrats love one another, and never mind the husband. It's obviously against the law, but you have to admit that the storm of passion that sweeps over Mrs. Anna and Prince Vronsky is beautiful. Storm and hurricane! In the eyes of your sisters, oh Jews that are lost to Judaism! Do you think wretched Anna, who abandons her pretty child, would have fallen in love with Vronsky at first sight, if she'd heard him fart? A thousands times no, gentlemen. Down with the so-called absolute love, inevitable and irresistible, and long live marriage! Real love is not about living with a woman because you love her but to love her because you live with her. I'm not convinced. Long live Mrs. Anna and her dear prince, who was better looking than you. Go to hell. - You're to be pitied. - Absolutely not. Yes, I am to be pitied, but I don't care and I'd happily eat something tasty. Got any fruit, Salomon? - An apple. - I don't like them. It's an unpleasant fruit. What an idiot that Adam was, really. Good night. Mangeclous, you are a loser. You are very ugly and useless. What's the point in living, if death is inevitable and Earth is populated by wicked people? And above all… Above all… If there's no God, there's no point in the universe. Lord God, I am alive. And, in a few seconds, I'll never move again. Pinhas Solal… What a stupid name. When I die, there'll be nothing left of me. My children are nauseating. My wife is vulgar. And I… I am an idiot with my Jewish armor. Macaroni with tripes… with lots of tomatoes and red pepper. Oh yes… That's good. THE FAME OF CALANTERI Scipion Ange Marie Escargassas, a sailor and boss on the small boat nicknamed "the Flamboyant", was cleaning himself, like every morning, because he really cared about charming women. He believed in fairly good faith that he was their squeeze. Come on Scipion! A kiss. I am thirsty for love, come on! - Oh, Scipion! - He is handsome, really. I'm handsome, hey? - You're a model guy, Scipion! - Yeah. Hey, look how handsome I am. Stop being a rascal! - You're naughty! - I'm handsome, am I not? Well, yes, I am handsome. We'll tell your wife, Scipion! And he believes me! Fresh fish! My ladies, at your service! Captain Scipion, of the Flamboyant. 20 years of sailing. Enjoy an outing at sea, with songs sung by the captain. Ladies first. And respect for beauty, hygiene, security and pleasure. Oh my! While Mangeclous and Michaël were doing their military service at the barracks of the 141st Infantry in Marseille, Mangeclous met Scipion Escargassas. He had become friends with the man, whose character suited him. The Valiants also got to know Scipion and were soon enamored with him. Oh! Oh… Oh, dear, they're already attached. How cheeky I am. Oh… Oh… Oh, ladies! Please get off, ladies! Leave! Friendship before pasion. Camaraderie before England. Besides, between you and me, there's Saint Helena… Come on, hurry! Leave! No mutiny on board! Come on now! Oh… What can one do, my friends? They'll carry me to their grave! They don't leave me alone. Come on, let's forget them. Let's go refresh ourselves. Right? Well, it's decided. I'll accompany you to Geneva. I want to see this League of Nations for myself. To do what, dear Scipion? To ask for the independence of Marseille, of course! How will you go about being admitted? I bet you all my fortune, that's 27,000 francs, that I will be seen by the head of the League of Nations. I'll meet your bet. On the condition that, if you lose you give me 27,000 francs, and if I lose I give you 2,700. You should be ashamed, Mattathias! Don't listen to him. I accept. Will you keep the stakes? Mattathias, show us your money. Oh… Here THE AUTONOMIST PARTY OF PROVENCE Come on, hurry! Get in! See you in Geneva! Where? At the station! The next train! LYON - CHAMBÉRY - GENEVA It's forbidden. What? How? Do you have your busking permit? No? Ah… I'll let it go this time, but… make sure you don't do it again. Come on, move along. Well, my friends… These Genevans are not very sociable. It must be related to the climate. Or maybe their digestion? Or maybe the lake water is, as one might say… purgative? Oh well… When I tell them in Marseille, that you need permission to sing here, they tell me I'm a liar. Geneva is a real Paris. Oh… Oh, Jeremy! Jeremy! Oh, Jeremy… Oh, sacred capitalist. What are you doing here? As it so happens, Mr. Scipion, I was about to get a train to Marseille this evening. It's been two years since I saw you! - What have you been doing? - Shush! A German prison. Good heavens, why? Because I'm a Jew. That's always the case with the Germans. If I didn't have to meet my friends from Cephalonia, I'd get on a train to Berlin immediately! I'd go… I'd go talk to Hitler, man to man. Come on, get up Jeremy. Get up. Why are you dressed like that? What are the Genevans going to say? It's all very luxurious here. They are all dressed in their Sunday best. Come on, come. - I'll get you new clothes. - No. Yes, I'll get you some new clothes. Come on. Come! Come! Come, gorgeous. Oh, I say Jeremy… You're being very stubborn. Why didn't you want a new coat? Because, Mr. Scipion, there are no new Jewish coats. A coat has to start by being new. - So… - That's a big mystery. It's like that for Jewish coats. But now, it's over. Now, to the hairdresser. - We'll cut your hair. - I can't do that. How so, you can't? Do you think you look good with your curls? You look like a concierge. Because if I cut them, people won't know I'm Jewish. Rest assured, you'll never be mistaken for an English person. Ah, holy Mary mother of God, can you believe this crazy sheep-head is my friend! Let's cut your beard a bit. - No, that's a sin. - What kind of sin? It's inconceivable to show any nudity. If I cut my beard, it's like I'm naked. In short, you are pious. - Maybe we can eat something together then? - We can. Oh! The five friends, had arrived on time at the meeting place chosen by the cryptogram's mystery writer. They were waiting. Saltiel's fragile heart was beating to the rhythm of the bells. What a beautiful collection. But who asked me to write to them, and to send them the check and the stupid cryptogram? Dedicated to the faux-pas. Now that they are here, I feel surrounded. What should I do? See them? Visits from the Valiants have never brought me happiness. This is an intolerable way of doing it! It's not a hotel for representatives of the League of Nations. - No… - Gentlemen, calm down. Please explain! - I want to know. - I understand. Listen, it's not a hotel, it's a guest house. It's unacceptable that the League of Nations treats representatives from other countries in this manner! Listen to me, ma'am! - Sir? - Listen to me! Gentlemen, today is Monday 26th April. We therefore arrived at Geneva train station where my brother Scipion waited for us. He cried hard and smelt onions in order to stop himself from fainting. And now we are reunited with Scipion and the Polish Jew in the bedroom of the mute and revered Saltiel. You always talk when I want to. But we already know all of that. Let's get to the bet I made with Scipion. Quiet, king of big, miserly noses! In England, we always summarize the question. Catholic brothers, were you able to be seen by the League of Nations? Give Mattathias my 27,000 francs. - Are you sure they won't see you? - They are terrible. I went on Friday with Jeremy, and the servant looked at me with the eyes of a cow. Do you know how insolent the eyes of cows are when they are looking at you pretending they understand everything? Since then, I have returned every day. And earlier, the policeman said he'd have me thrown out of Switzerland if I set foot back at the League. They even searched me to check if I didn't have a gun. Saltiel, hand over the money. If he wasn't seen, he's lost the bet. Not yet. I'll make sure that Scipion gets seen by the League. I want my 27,000! You'll win the bet if within 24 hours, Scipion has not been seen by an important person belonging to this joke of Nations. Mangeclous, try to get two like me in. If you manage, I'll feed you as you wish, for 12 hours straight. As much fresh, unpressed caviar as I want? Uh-huh. Gentlemen, I'll make sure you are ceremoniously received tomorrow and in large numbers. I'll make sure that Scipion and Jeremy get in. May I know how you'll manage to do so? With this. And how will you make sure we are received? With… this. Armed with a nail and information gleaned from the hotel register, Michaël forced the lock of the room of the foreign delegates of the League of Nations, who, by chance, had ended up at this modest guest house. For heaven's sake! We weren't going to let Mattathias pocket all the savings of the small man from Marseille, his brother in arms. GUEST HOUSE Could you explain to me just how you are going to do it? My dear, if you were to give me a million… Even if you were to give me 50 francs I wouldn't say anything. Can I at least come with you? If you pay tribute to me, yes. Wait at the buffet. I paid to find out what you do. If you follow me, may your one-toothed wife become blind, and may she live to be 120, so she really suffers a lot. May you get cancerous consumption in prison, while your daughter… Enough, enough, I'll wait! Pff… So? Did you do it all in 10 minutes? I'll see the League of Nations head tomorrow? God is great, and so am I. The next day, Scipion and Jeremy arrived at the Palace of Nations, looking more noble-like in rented frock coats and some fake decorations. Scipion held the envelope, whose contents he did not know. He was repeating out loud the advice Michaël had given him. Be arrogant. Give this envelope to the head, but be arrogant, above all. Jeremy, if you aren't arrogant enough, watch out for your curls. What do you want, gentlemen? Don't take that tone with me! I'm not in the mood to accept the taunts of a kitchen hand! I want to see your boss and quickly! Sir John is in a conference… Silence! English servant… - What name should I give him? - So much curiosity. Come on, hurry, you inferior. Give him this envelope and make sure he sees us soon. What bad manners! Letting people wait like this… I should warn Mr. Director, that these men are somewhat eccentric. I know. Sir John met them in Paris. He found the new government's delegates to be very badly brought up, but not as stupid as they seemed. They seem fairly cross. The telegram that Mangeclous had sent himself from Lausanne had just arrived. The fake lawyer had planned his diabolical plot very well. He just needed an older town than Lausanne's name to the telegram's address and replace his name with Saltiel's. But, above all, , he had to make sure no-one suspected him. He wrote to his friends. The future-deceased Mangeclous to his brothers of destiny, greetings. I am defeated. The Machiavellian plan I'd innocently put together to make sure you are received by the League of Nations has failed. I remain alone, in despair. Pray for the fallen Mangepoix. Gentlemen, I am honored to welcome you and to tell your Your Excellencies of the joyous hope your arrival brings us and which will be, I hope, the beginning of a new era in the relations between your noble country and the League of Nations. I wipe the slate clean and decree amnesty. May I suggest that you follow me to my office? When we require it, we'll tell you. May I venture to say, that the Geneva establishment is keen to not do anything to damage your great country's prospects as it re-joins the wide international family. Real ones, I hasten to say. It is quite understandable. You've no doubt lived for a long time in Provence, Mr. Minister? One could say that that's a little tactless, on your part, but no offense taken. I'll reply politely that my father was from Marseille. And when we left to immigrate to the future great country, I was… No, I was 15 years old. So, naturally I'd got into the habit of speaking with the accent. And you can't iron out an accent. Please may I know what the intentions of your government are with regards to your noble country re-joining us? Before replying about matters relating to my noble country, I would like some information on what your noble Palace is doing for world peace. When there is a war, what do you do? We suffer. All the dead, it's atrocious. And what do you do when a war starts? We put together a file. We give a press release to the press in which we express our regret. And what if the war continues? In that case, we adopt a strong stance. We set up a commission, and even sub-committees. And we even, if necessary, request that the warring nations to put an end to the bloodshed. Yes, but what if the war continues? In that case, we don't just kindly ask them to stop, we recommend that they consider ending the conflict. Yes, but what if the war continues? In that case we send out signals through which we rule in favor of the weak, without ruling against the stronger side either. Generally speaking, military operations end up finishing well. I like to know the names of my friends, it makes conversation easier. What nickname did your mother give you? - Adhémar. - Oh wow… Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Well, Mr. Adhémar… Let me tell you what upsets me. It seems to me that it pains you to say the name of my noble country. That you're disgusted by it. No, I always speak nicely of the Republic of Argentina. I thank you. I thought you didn't want to pronounce the name. Well, that's sorted. To be completely honest, I'm going to tell you something, Mr. Adhémar, which doesn't please me at all. When you say to me "Mr. Minister". Is it that difficult to use my full title? Our government is strict, it wants us to be respected. When it comes to being polite, we are the worst in Argentina! One rude deed and bang, the price is three revolver shots! You may search for well-educated countries, but you won't find any as well-educated as Argentina. Yes, Mr. Plenipotentiary Minister and extraordinary envoy. I add that I am not against formalities. It is with pleasure that I observe that Mr. Plenipotentiary Minister… You don't have to say it all the time, once is enough, now. Do you know Argentina? Not at all? Well, from some 30 years ago, Mr. Minister. All the better, as the country has changed. It's full of mosquitoes now. Previously, when I was Minister of the Navy, I would get aboard the Flamboyante, it's our biggest battleship. All the modern comforts. Torpedoes as big as my arm, my friend. Perhaps, I'm talking too much about myself. I'd be better off talking about my colleague. He is missing something. Do you understand the veiled reference? We like them in Argentina, since we are for freedom of conscience. He was Justice Minister. He is quiet, but impressive. You should say something to him. He's ashamed that you're not speaking to him. So, Mr. Minister, the Republic of Argentina has been pained by the loss of its president? Yes. Yes, it was very amusing. Sorry? Well, it has to be said that our venerated president made for a funny corpse, so we had a laugh about it. At the funeral? Ah, well it's a custom in Argentina. We always laugh at funerals, in order to hide our pain. Let me play a little game with you. Let me give you 10 pistachios, Mr. Director. There. And, what do I do now? Now, you give me a 5 Swiss franc coin. Thanks. And what does the game consist of? It consists of me keeping the five francs. And then? Then we start again. It's a little game from Argentina that makes people laugh. The Deputy Director General is now happy to let you know he is awaiting the delegates from the Republic of Argentine. I don't feel very well. I'm going to the toilet and I'll be back. Bad news, Uncle? I'm scared, my child. If it's bad news, I'll hold your hand. Bad news from my wife, Uncle? Better than that, my son. Call Mangeclous, Michaël and Mattathias. Salomon, your jacket is unbuttoned. Do it up. Mattathias, straighten up your harpoon. Michaël, your guitar is inappropriate. Thanks, gentlemen. Take a seat. Gentlemen, stand. Four or five dozen centuries are facing you. My children, the Kingdom has been bought to life again and I am the head of it. Saltiel, have you got a headache? Do you not want to go to bed? It's you, Mattathias, that might end up in bed, when you find out more. If I don't die reading this telegram, it's thanks to my great will and energy. Now, let me read you the telegram, which has been written by one of the greatest men of Israel. Dr. Chaïm Weizmann. "I heard you are in Geneva." "Stop. Following the decision by the British government, I've secretly been nominated temporary president of the Jewish republic." "Stop. And hurray." "The news will be made public in a few days." "Stop." "Need to choose someone not mixed up in internal fights as the Prime Minister." "Stop." "In memory of your many letters, and admiring your political genius and seizing the opportunity of you being in Geneva, I nominate you… Prime Minister of the Jewish Republic." Carry on! "I make you responsible for forming a ministry." "I recommend you run to the League of Nations in order to obtain a huge territory. Stop." "Zionist greetings sincere political wishes, Dr. Weizmann." And as a postscript: "Get in touch with the Zionist representatives in Geneva, who I have written to via AirMail." "Stop." "Be strong. Stop." "50 centuries are looking down on you." "Stop." It's very beautifully written. These "stops" are admirable and clearly show a man of action. Now, no time to lose. Let's form a ministry. I put myself forward as a vice-president of the Council, minister of Justice and of Commerce. One moment. How do we know that the telegram is real? It says it's from Jerusalem. He's not wrong. Who says that it's really Dr. Weizmann that sent it? It's authentic, gentlemen! "Get in touch with the Zionist representatives in Geneva, who I have written to via AirMail." He wrote to them, gentlemen! The Zionist representative of Geneva… Shut the window, Salomon, to keep our discussion secret. As I was saying, the Zionist representative of Geneva knows the writing paper and the signature of the dear Doctor! I won't be persuaded until we've spoken to the Zionist representative. There's a large book, with all the numbers… Stop your explanations, Mattathias. Don't tell me what I already knew before I was born. Come on, gentlemen. What? Hello? Is this the Zionist representative? Yes? Well, the honored Saltiel, a chosen man of great wisdom will do you the honor of talking to you. Well, say "hello"! Hello? So, gentlemen, the Zionist office at the League of Human Nations knows about this. Indeed, yesterday, they received via AirMail a letter from Doctor Weizmann in Jerusalem. The Zionist representative was busy getting dressed up in full luxury to come pay his respects to me. - We are going to see Zionists. - No. I told him to come later, since the ministry has not been assembled. One moment. How come Dr. Weizmann thought of you? Dash it! There are Rothschilds in this world, better-known men. You gnawing worm, hindrance to the ministry, shut up! Do you want me to kick you out, Saltiel? Gentlemen… Jealousy is a feeling that some disgraced people experience and we have to sympathize with it rather than letting it irritate us. You should know, toad, that I've been corresponding for 20 years with Dr. Weizmann! But he never replies to you. - Twice he replied! - In 20 years! And only a few words. But such words! "I thank you for your letter "which I read with great interest." What more do you want? Do you not know that Uncle invented all kinds of things? Yes, a hammer fitted with a nail dispenser. The anti-fog syringe, the baby carriage brake which stops the wheels when you let it go. And an ink that dries instantly. Yes, but how did Dr. Weizmann know Saltiel's address in Geneva? The Zionist I called told me that thanks to his spies, he found out I was at this hotel. And that knowing the admiration Dr. Weizmann has for me, he sent him a telegram straight away. There, it's clear! Mattathias, let us become ministers. Man of little faith. Still, Saltiel is a stranger, even though he invented things no one wanted. Am I a stranger, me? But don't you know that an entire book called Solal has been written about me, using my very own name and that the author of this book is a certain Cohen whose first name is Albert? Don't you know that in every country of the world and even in Ceylon, people like me because of that book? - And you've not read it! - I've read the book. I don't like it. I like it. Except there's one page with a naked lady. Gentlemen, let's not lose time because of novels! Uncle is well-known, that's a fact. And I am too. And I'll be even more well-known, since I'm going to be Minister of Foreign Affairs. No, that's my title. Let's take action and create this Jewish ministry! Make your choice. Hm, so, me… Uncle Saltiel took the lion's share and awarded himself five ministries. Mangeclous was named Ministry of Justice. And Mattathias, Minister of Finances, under the condition, imposed by Mangeclous, that Mattathias would give back the Treasury keys every evening. Michaël said he would be satisfied to watch over Saltiel while he slept and to be head of his security. Salomon was nominated Minister of War, with the promise of being given a sword and a plume, and a real horse. What will I do on horseback? - Nothing! - Very well. Every week, you'll go to the bank of Jerusalem and be given two pounds sterling. When Uncle passes away, you'll shine your sword. These are small details! What will our political stance be? - A coalition with England. - And France! - Agreed. And then? - We declare war against Germany. And a general exemption from army service. I only accept the first point, Mr. Minister. Agreed, but no war. No, the declaration will be enough. We'll send the Germans an anonymous letter with curses. No taxes for ministers. I refuse dictatorially. A pension for orphans and widows. Okay, and a higher one for fathers of three children. A gold stallion! What's that? A large golden horse that you put in the bank vault. If it's fat, you get a good rate. What's the political color of the cabinet? - Mine, without jabbering! - What do you mean? No need to take the airs of a dictator, Mr. Saltiellini. My political color is Zionist, anti-Semitic, royalist, communist. - Impossible, Mr. Vice-president. - So, Tory then! I am a Tory in spirit. Provisionally adopted, the Tories having done well in England. Before we go to the League of Nations, we need to go to the hairdressers. This meeting is over. The weather is good today, General, sir. I am pleased for the little birds. When the weather is good, they can have fun. If it's not good, they don't sing. But, sometimes, they sing even when it rains. Birds are lovely things. I'm going to go outside and look at them now. No. Are you from Argentina? From Argentina, Mr. General. Tell me about the political situation in Argentina. So-so, part good, part bad. Where's your colleague? - I'll go get him. - No. Give me your general impression of Argentina. Oh… My impression is not that important. Hurry. My general impression of Argentina… is that it's a country very far away. I don't think I could say it better than that. Now, if you want a specific impression, I'll explain another time because I've got a bit of a headache. I'll go for a quick spin and I'll be back. You are a comedian. Yes, Mr. General. That is to say, a little. The ambassador of Argentina is in the private room next door. Want to see him? No. No, thank you, because… Well, because… I'm angry with Mr. Ambassador. Why? It's a family secret, Mr. General. Why would you be angry with Mr. Ambassador? He killed my father. How did he kill your father? - He pulled off his beard and nails. - Is that it? With a revolver, a knife and poison. The ambassador is a crook. I don't want to see him anymore. No, he's very nice. - But he killed your father. - That doesn't matter. He's an assassin. What does assassin mean? Every one is an assassin. No, Mr. Ambassador is a good man. Now I'm going for a quick spin. No. General… I am a poor Jew. I'm not Argentinian, or French, I'm not Swiss or Swedish. Nothing. A Jew. My name in French is Jeremy. - So prison, now, sir? - Obviously. Are you sad to be going to prison? A bit sad. But glad I don't have tuberculosis. And if you had tuberculosis? I'd be glad I didn't have cancer. And if you had cancer? I'd be glad to be a Jew. It's a catastrophe. But beautiful. Why? The other nations, Mr. General, have moments, when, for two or three years, they believe man will be the brother of man, that there won't be any more rich, poor or wicked. We've always believed this. For two or three thousand years. It's a good thing. So, prison still, Mr. General? Very much prison. Fine, Mr. General. I am ready for prison. I don't know Geneva's prison yet. I don't want to be disturbed. Lord Balfour would like to see Mr. Under-Secretary-General. I'll ring. High speed to the League of Nations! Hey, Mangeclous! Wait! Mangeclous thought his idea was brilliant. Why give Saltiel first place? Arrive first, talk to the head, get nine tenths of the Palestinian territory from him, send a telegram to Dr. Weizmann with the news, and demand to be named president of the Council there and then. No procrastination and fun, my friend. Take this envelope and run to your master to tell him that I present him with the wishes of the Jewish population of Palestine, who whine inwardly of having too small a territory. Let me handle this. It's quite likely a nutter, but I have to admit that I find him particularly comical. I therefore thought, Sir, that you'd also find him funny. Send him away. Wait. I've changed my mind. Let him in my salon, along with his acolytes who will no doubt join him. Very well, Mr. Under-Secretary-General. I wonder what this Under-Secretary-General is called. - He's English, I'm sure. - You are not allowed to speak. Don't blame me, I admit with cynicism that I wanted to oust you. We'll talk about it later. He's making us wait too long. What do you expect? After all we are but a Jewish government. We'll have to hurry to buy a dozen enormous and pointed bombers, so that… others respect us a bit more. You shall not kill. Listen, Uncle, I hand in my resignation. These interviews are not for us. Coward! No. I am courageous, but not when there is danger. I could have you shot for giving up your role. Fine, but let's leave! Listen, Saltiel. I don't like this whole affair. I'm handing in my resignation. Say what you want, but I'll take no part in this. And, actually, I need to tell you something. I regret receiving you covered like this with bandages, but I was in a car accident a few days ago. - A fatal accident? - No. Thanks. How can I help you? Hurry, I have a meeting at 6 p.m. Personally, I want nothing. I want nothing either… Your Highness. Mr. Saltiel wants something. No idea why he brought us here. I only wish to know one thing: the train times. But one of the palace servants will tell me. I'm going. Goodbye, Your Highness. I would like to gather my thoughts for a moment, Your Excellency. Pleased to meet you. The League of Nations is a noble institution. Take a seat, Your Excellency. Excellence, at a time when Geneva was a mere putrid swamp with a few huts at its water's edge, around which men, sadly naked, caught prey with their teeth… there was a splendid town in the Orient. This town was majestic and crowned, and populated with a multitude of God's children who waved palms and said the commandments that God had sent to men for them to become men. This town was called Jerusalem, capital of the kingdom of Israel. In short, Excellence, this nation is on the brink of being rebuilt. It did me the honor of calling me its guide, and I take on this role gladly. And now it's my turn to sweeten my tongue, using tasteful and beautifully decorated phrases. I will start, because I am a man of good education… by expressing our sympathies for the terrible car accident you were in, which, thankfully, wasn't fatal. After presenting you our best wishes of healing and good health, which my opponent forgot to do, since he chose instead to talk about putrid swamps… Come on now… Thanks for being my ally, Your Highness. I now come to my legal presentation. Your Highness, what is this about? It's about the following: the English government is not giving us enough land in Palestine. As a result, Jewish kids are starving. Jewish cows are fainting and starving in convulsions, as a result of having nothing to eat. The panthers of Palestine only eat wild raspberries and are perishing away, night after night. Therefore, Your Highness… we'd like a larger territory, please. Sign a little paper for me. I'll get it registered myself. No need to do it yourself. How many kilometers square is England offering you? I've no idea. Anyway, whether square or round, the kilometers offered to us by England are clearly not enough. You need only put, for example: "I give you twice as much as England." If England gives three quarters of Palestine, it will be difficult for us to give you double. Don't worry about it, Your Highness. In that case, we'll take a bit of Egypt. Don't worry about it. We must still think of the Arabs. We'll give them a tip and some insecticide. They'll remain calm. No. I can't give you that much. Make us an offer. - 10% more than England. - Highness! Are you joking? - Your Excellence! - One moment. Your Highness, I must discuss a State secret in the corner. Don't mind the cutting remarks. We're still friends, but rest assured, I won't take the presidency from you. Let me handle it. I've understood where he's going with this. Your Highness! Let's look at the bigger picture. I spoke earlier of tipping the Arabs. We do, indeed, have immense capital at our disposal, Highness. Maybe you have a family, sick children, doctor's fees or living beings to feed? A dead person to bury? Well, we financial backers, Your Highness… we understand these things. I order you to shut up! Don't listen to that impure man. What he's saying interests me. So I was saying, dear Highness, that we should have a private discussion to which I'd come accompanied by… a small suitcase. Talking of suitcases, have you noticed how many bank notes can fit in a small suitcase? Thousands and thousands, Highness. You are a scoundrel. - I don't believe you. - You sent the telegram. Didn't you? Your Highness! What a conjecture! Me? Me?! A whole life of honor, Highness! Highness! An insult of that kind cannot be washed from my blood because I care about yours! - I am therefore leaving. - No! Gentlemen, I ask you to leave us alone. How do you expect me to have sent the telegram if it was sent last night from Jerusalem? Ha. I swear I was in Switzerland yesterday. You are a scoundrel, Mangeclous. Highness, you know my nickname? Sit down. Humbly, Your Highness. Based on the service instructions of this telegram it emerges that it should contain 189 words. Yet it only contains 182 words. What did you do with the other seven words? They are in my modest hotel room. Oh, Your Highness, don't overdo it… This is sobering me a lot. I take the blame. He who accuses himself excuses himself, Your Highness. You sent the telegram. Humbly, from Lausanne, Your Highness. I'd sent it to myself, to tweak it a little. Saltiel will never forgive me, but I did it for him. And for you. And for me, of course, Highness. Delusions of grandeur made me forget my virtuous past. I told myself, Highness, that all political men start with deception. So why not me too? What a prime minister I'd have made. What inventions, what prosperity, for my population and for myself. What a fleet, what an army, what… What a bribe. And all lost forever because of a few missing words in a telegram. I am morally dead man, Your Highness. And killed by whom, Highness? By you! Highness… Without offending you, you've killed a man. And what a man! I pardon you, while hoping that your generous palm will give me the damages you owe me. The return journey Geneva-Lausanne, the telegram cost, the glue, scissors, camping stove and loss of honour. Oh, and don't forget the corruption money for my friend Silberfeld of Geneva. He hung about by the telephone booth of the café to play the role of Zionist representative very well when Saltiel called him up. In short… I am weighing up the damage caused materially and morally… I estimate it to be between 6,000 and 9,900 francs, without mentioning the shortfall. Because… Because, in that case, I'd ask for millions! In my capacity as minister of Justice can you imagine how many small suitcases I'd have received? We could arrive at a compromise of 15,000 francs, taking into account the sorrow of having thus deceived Saltiel, who has been struck by fate so cruelly. Poor man. He only talks to me about his nephew that he lost and that he wants to find. Bring Saltiel in. Of course, Highness. Close the door. If you'd only seen how he lifted me up, how he hugged me! Ah, my dears! I feel like my hands are solid and my feet young again! He explained everything. His silence over the past few years, the letter, the check. He kissed me on the forehead and he crushed my shoulders! Our tears ran abundantly. Again, Uncle! He knelt in front of me. What a disgusting spectacle. I heard you, cobra. Your three dirty little blackheads are not part of the League of Nations, I assume? It appears that way. What's more, I heard that one of your nephews sells silk stockings under an umbrella on the boulevards of Paris. But… If he loves you so much, why did he not come to the meeting? Something unforeseen held him up! Shush my children. My nephew is meeting an archbishop. I advise you to behave correctly. If he pays me and feeds me, I'll be a gentleman. If he gave that Jeremy 10,000 francs in cash, damn him: he owes me 10 times more! And did you see with what arrogance the lord told the teller on the phone to bring him his three months pay? Wage in the eyes of your mother, woman of easy virtue! One does not say wage, when one is a viceroy of the world. - Oh… - Really? I didn't know. No need to say bad things about my mother. It's a manner of speaking. What does one say, in which case? - Fees. - Civil list! I say "viceroy of the world", but I should say "king". May the devil gobble up that old Englishman, the calamitous Sir John, so that we can take his place. I think that old English imbecile, has been put there as a figurehead. Does the expression "viceroy" shock your ears? I have observed one thing. When your nephew was embassy secretary, you insulted us if we pretended to think that there was a rung above secretary. Now he's beneath secretary level… Did you dare to say below a secretary? And you're forgetting, man of bad faith, you're forgetting "general", which is the important word here! General of what? Of all the nations! He going to play the Embassy Secretary trick. A Under-Secretary-General, my friend, arrives at his office one morning. What happens? A phone call from Romania. Can you put taxes up? My nephew's cold and nasty reply: No, imbeciles from the Balkans, and cheaters at cards: no new taxes! And he hangs up. A phone call from Hungary. We have no money left. We are penniless. And so, my nephew… You've spent everything again, you Hungarian imbeciles, camel dung! "The country is poor, Your Excellence", the Hungarians reply. "Yes", replies Sol, "you've wasted all the money I gave you last month again, you Hungarians!" "By building opera houses, and orchestras and by drinking iced coffee!" By buying violins that are too expensive! Go to bed! - And so on! - And England? England too. The English call and say: "Can we build another 10 battleships?" My nephew replies with a friendly, musical and sad tone. Where is all this coming from? - Pff! - So, back to the English… My darling replies in the following manner: "Dear Prime Minister of England, do you not think you're pushing it a bit?" "I'd like to please you, but I can't allow you to have more than nine battleships." So there, my friend, there! Get out now, Mattathias. I no longer want to see your miserly face of a sick lemon! Get out, imbecile! You ignorant man! Do you know how to greet a Polish minister? By spitting in his face. Okay. Does the other one get angry? Not at all, my child: he thanks him. Everything is sorted. The Argentinian case is finished. The count of Surville, the main witness, is off to work in the Balkans this evening and Huttington's on a long vacation. Do you not have any contraband business to entrust me with, while giving me diplomatic immunity? If the League of Nations looks after imports, exports or mortgages I could, after examination, enter the business. Can we help you, my son, stamp documents, for example? Or let us replace you. So that we can get joy from refusing passports and visas. - Oh no, what pleasure! - Ah… I'd love to say to some Polish consul: "It's my turn to burn you, roast you!" "Come back in two months and I'll say if I'll give you a visa following the police enquiry on you!" Ah, that's… That's the teller. - He's going to give me my wages. - Ah. Wages. He said "wages". - Well, yeah… - Be well-behaved. Come in! Mr. Under-Secretary-General, that's 372,500 francs. One, two… three, four… Count the notes before giving him the receipt. 70,000, 71… I can't. There are too many. In the name of your mother, don't do anything of the kind. Can you come back later? As you wish Mr. Under-Secretary-General. Oh, you poor soul… Poor Highness. I never thought you'd cause me this much pain. Who do you look like? I always recount money when I get change for 20 francs. And I always protest before checking, to make my rights clear. Gentlemen, let us all count. Let's get started, gentlemen, since the thief will return soon. In their presence, Solal adopted an almost stupid expression, the Valiants couldn't know that this smokescreen was designed for them. What's more, he liked to scandalise his old uncle and enjoyed watching his outrage. What are you going to do with all this money? Well, I'll leave it here. What, in a wooden drawer? Or, otherwise, in my pockets. 372,000 Swiss francs in a pair of trousers? It should at least be trousers made of iron with locks! What should I do? We'll spend the night with you. Tomorrow, we'll accompany you to the bank vault. Lord Solal, I lift my foaming tankard to confirm that this is the first time in my life, that I have eaten… and, may God forgive me, that I'm no longer hungry. What could I say that's better? Thanks, therefore, to the League of Nations. I now understand its purpose and its humanitarian role. I'll never forget this great day, in which I really, truly ate well. I am restored, full, sated, satiated, gorged, filled and nourished! In the name of my beloved stomach, thank you. I'm hungry. I wonder how much he'll be charged for his meals. Luckily, his money is in a safe place. - Where? - A very safe place. I'll tell you later. But I get the impression that Sol has had enough of us. Such ingratitude! - Why? - I don't know. You didn't behave like gentlemen during dinner. How can eating be gentlemanly? Do gentlemen not eat? Anyway, he talked about the joys of the mountains and advises us to go camping on Salève, a mountain with an elevation of 1,200 metres and a rack and pinion railway. Yes, Uncle, long live the Swiss mountains. Yes, we'll think about the idea. So, first explain to us what this safe place is for the money. He entrusted me with the 372,000 francs. They are in my shirt. Hey, hey! You forgot the 500 francs. - Give the 372,500 francs to me to keep. - No. - So, at least the 500. - No! Yes, my son, what's the matter? Are you not feeling well? Thank God. Listen, the things are still here. You don't understand? I'm talking about the 372 francs… and the 50 centimes. It's a small amount, but rest assured we're looking after it. You want me to give them all your money? Never, Sol! Do you hear me? Never! Pleased at the prospect of telling their friends in Cephalonia that they'd climbed the enormous Swiss mountain, and after recommending their souls and bodies to God, they set off. The only exception was Michaël, who declared that he was being held back in Geneva by a certain personal matter. The others understood. This cold is wholesome. I love the unforeseen parts of this rustic life. Help… Help. - Go away. - Don't move. You might upset her. Gentlemen, provided you don't attack her, she won't hurt you. Be sure to hide your fear. Salomon, don't make any sudden movements. She might get angry. Michaël! I looked for you everywhere. I went to the top of the mountain and the mountain people said I'd find you here. You are known in these parts. Obviously. We came down a little because our ears were buzzing from the thin air. - Are you happy here? - Of course.

In my opinion, cows here have horns that are too sharp and a stare that is too intense. I was planning on running away secretly. - Me too! - Me too!

I'm worried he might get dizzy and fall. Suddenly, in a dazzling illumination, Mangeclous understood that God loves each being individually and with absolute love. He saw that God loved this particular bird and in particular, the ridiculous good-for-nothing named Mangeclous, and the tiniest insect and every reptile, and even the small, sharp stones. Glory to God. I'll give all my money to the poor. And me, half. They were five friends, on a clear morning, and all imbued with truth and beauty. Never in their life would they ever relive such a moment, but they'd never forget it. Subtitle translation by: Ginger Clark
