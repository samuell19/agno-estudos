FIGHTING ALONE AGAINST INJUSTICE HIS NAME BECAME SIMBOL OF STRENGTH THIS IS THE STORY OF MACISTE HIS LEGEND HAS SURPASSED ALL TIMES COLOSSUS OF THE ARENA ( Death on the Arena ) (Maciste, World's Strongest Gladiator) ROME, a night in the year 261 A.D. - Well? - I'll send it right away. Don't worry! I'll take it myself. Listen, I don't want anyone to disturb us. Understood? It's the best Falerno that I know of. You can judge for yourself. Stuff for the nobles. Offer of the house. I see! Well, let's talk about what matters. You know I much it will cost? A hundred "talenti", for each one, is enough. Paid after, obviously. Trust me: I always lived among them. Nobody knows them better than I. You'll have the most capable man. The bloodier and cruel. The most unmerciful. No! Another two. - What's your name? - Fisio. This one. I've seen him fighting yesterday. Good choice. Bruto is the best of my fighters. He's been fighting for twenty years. Look at him. Look well! Look at the wounds, the scars. Turn around. Your opponents always strike you. Yes, but they are all dead. Your freedom has cost me more than what you are, really worth. Now, I'm your only master. I could ask you to fight to death... ... one against another. Anyone of you would succeed, to save your heads. But then, you would face other challenges. Miserable life, always fighting to survive. Cannon fodder! Instead, I offer you money and freedom. What I want in exchange, is easy from people like you. Let's get it clear: you'll risk your life, now! But, it will be only once. If everything goes well, you'll be free men. Very rich to go home. You Bruto, in Tracia. You Fisio, in Iberia. You Sidone, in Illiria. You Astorige, in Galia. You Arminio, in Beozia. And you in Numibia, Tucos. - In your case. - What are you talking about? Obey me and don't ask questions. But you can refuse. Who accepts, pass beyond the spear. It seems I wasted my money. I believed you, to be smart. Come in! - I go, as long as he joins us, too. - Who is he? - My brother Menide. - I don't know him. What does he do? Take it. Try to strike him. Don't worry. It's very sharp! Go, strike him. Are you satisfied? I hope your brother doesn't cost much. MERSABAD Capital of a Kingdom in Asia Minor The Mersabad kingdom will never have a more... ... just king than my father. His governing was always inspired by wisdom and fairness. I will, with loyalty, follow all the laws he has passed. Our beloved queen Talima will anounce the decision... ... over the matter between Sclepione and Telite. After having examined your complaints... I order you, Sclepione, to pay Telito for the damages you have caused him. No! This is not the way to do it. This is an offence to your queen. Pick up the money, Sclepione. Thank you, Talima. Thank you. I won't allow anymore that the powerful oppress the weak. The rich take advantage of the poor. I was prematurely called... ... to take the destiny of this kingdom, but don't ilude yourselves. My father protected the unfortunate and the humble people... ... and his wish will live beyond his death. You go way beyond his will. You want to crush the aristocracy... ... but forget that we, the nobles, are the main support of the throne. My throne rests upon the wellness of the people. May I say what goes on my mind? Yes, my dear sister. Your opinion is very important to me. You were wonderful. I'm very proud of you. You can count on my loyal support. I will do everything to make your governing easier. I'm sure it will be very useful, prince Oniris. You're the leader of our party, and should have intervened,... ... instead, you betray our cause. - Bring wine! - Yes, bring it! - Wine! Wine! - Quickly! - I want to drink! - You, bring more wine! All right, all right. Tell me. - Woman, come. - Come here. Do you know that we're nice to the ladies? - Come here! - See, how tender she is! I"ve told you we are nice to the ladies. - Come to me. - Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! - Stay here with us. - Come. Those there, want other wine, what should I do? Exchange it! Give it to them! Why don't they leave Mersabad and return to Rome? Here it is. Come down, you damn beast! Come down, I told you! Come down! Let's go. You're eating all my food. How much longer will I say this? Come down, will you? Come down! You'll see what I'll do to you. That's not the way to treat an animal. Look. Look how I do it. Come dear! Alll you have to do is be gentle, nice, kind. I'll show him the gentleness. Jump! Come down! Come down, damn beast! Let it go! You damned monkey! I feel lonely. I want company. Let's cheer to the ladies. - You came, finally. - Let me go! Dirty pigs! - I'll sort you out! - Calm down, Goliath. Dance! Show us how you dance. Dirty pigs, let me go! - Come with me. - Come on, dance! Damned bandits, let her go! Go away, or I'll beat you up. You brute gorila. Put him here. Let me go! No! Help! Help! Dirty pig, let me go! Let her go! Let her go! Ah! Dirty pig, let me go! Enough! What did you say? Let's throw these savages out. I'll give you a hand. Where were you, giant? Ah... Goliath. Run Goliath. Thank you. You have ruined me, damned bandits. One, two three, four, five! Stop! Stop! Wine? Are you thirsty? Watch out, Goliath! What did you say? - If you come close, I hit you. - Hit hard! Damned pigs! Brute gorila! No, no, my beard no! Let go my beard! Ah, you were hiding? Come out. All right. Astorige! You like wine, hey? Then, drink it! This one is sour, but good for a bath. This one is old, see how good it is. All my wine! My best wine. There's no more. Take! Take, the last sip! No! No! Let me go, let me go! Help! Help! Help! Help! They have hanged me! Help! Help! They have hanged me! Help! Help! Are you crazy? What did we talk about? - They provoked us. - And beat us, first. - By surprise. - We were all drunk. They hurt me, look! Out! Quickly! Maciste. You stink! You really got a good bath in the wine! Yes, wine! I ran! I ran! Poor innkeeper! Yes, yes, tell me everything later. Now, let's refresh your mind. - A bath will do you good. Come on. - No, no, Maciste. - Don't make me angry. - No, not in the water Maciste. - Come, come. feel it! - Please, Maciste, no! You'll feel better, after! - No, Maciste no! - Over here. - Please, listen to me. - Over here. - What, go ahead... - Not in the water, Maciste. Maciste! Maciste! Assir, what happened to you? Don't worry about me, go quickly to the inn. Poor me. Ah...ah.. ... poor Bango, to be bathing in this dirty water. Maciste! Maciste! Maciste, dear, they ruined me. They destroyed everything. They even cut my beard. My beautiful long beard. My God I ask you, give me back my beard! They have all, been beaten. I am ruined! They cooked me like ham! Maciste, dear. All my jugs! But my beard, Maciste, make me recover my beard! - Have courage. - All right. - You'll recover it. - You think so? They'll pay for this. Within a few days, you'll be crowned queen of Mersabad... ... and no kingdom will have a more gracious queen. I should say... enchanting. Strict. I know Ligonio, specially when you say something... ... and can't find the right word. - I know you understand. - Why are you afraid every time we speak about my coronation? I'm the head of your guards... ... and my duty is to protect you. Nothing else? Come on, tell me, what do you think? Come on, I order you to speak. You're a young queen to be alone. Even you, advise me to marry. Marry prince Oniris... ... or a foreigner. Tell me, what should I do? It's not me who say it. It's the law of the state. I know. But it's not what says my heart. What's all this noise? You'll have to endure it. It's the people arriving for your coronation. Come close, don't be afraid! Who are those ones? A group of gladiators from Rome. They'll be exhibiting in the arena, during the celebrations. Come! Come closer! Show off your strength. Try! Try to open Sidone's arms. The strongest man in Rome. Granite muscles, iron nerves. Go, go. I have a price for anyone who beat him. He's one of my seven gladiators. You may admire him in the arena, and see the other ones. Tucos of Numibia, Astorige. The powerful Bruto, the giant Sidone. Soon, you may see all of them, in the arena. It will be a magnificent show. My gladiators will exhibit for you. You shouldn't miss it! Maciste! Look, it's them! Enough. Courage. Is there anyone else? Come forward! Come learn the forbidden strikes... ... the tricks, the one hundred duels. Here is a young fellow. Come. Come challenge my gladiators. That's the one who cut my beard. Let me go! With pleasure. Ah, finally I've found you. Finally, you're going to pay. You're going to pay all the damages, done to my inn. Where is my beard? What are you laughing for, gorila? - What did you say? - I said "gorila". I said it was my beard. Pig! Do you want to loose, also, the remaining? Maciste! Help! Maciste! Help! Help me, Maciste! Let him go! - Otherwise? - Calm down, bruto. What's happening? Let me pass! Let me pass! What's happening? Nothing, nothing. My men axaggerated a bit... ... and his wine made them loose their heads. Here's, for the damages. It should be enough. Happy? Come to see the strongest gladiators... - Ligonio. - Maciste! - My friend. - I'm happy to see you. So am I,to see you again. ... so, they gave me, to fix my inn... ... my beautiful beard, I don't have it anymore. - Without a beard, I'm not a man. - Shut up! What the heck? Who dare to throw water on me? Why don't I have a beard, I didn't say "weak". - You're not my friend. - I'm not your friend? - What do you say? - No, you're not my friend. - Tell me something. - Let's seat. Wait...., listen.... How long will it take for my beard to grow long, once again. How long was it? - Up to my navel. This big. - Ah... -Tell me everything. - How old are you? Me? Ten, twenty, thirty, fifty... - Eighty one! - Now, it can't grow. - How come, it can't grow? - It can't grow! Yours can't grow! It can't grow. I'm made of iron, iron! Help! - What's happening? - I don't know, someone's screaming. My money? Eh, Maciste. The thieves... The thieves of the night... - The thieves... - All my money... What happened? What happened? - They stole my money! - Your money? - Look what I found. Look. - Who are you? I think I know what happened. Go, I will watch over you. Be quiet. You can't sleep? Is there something you dislike, tell us? If I knew, I would go back to Rome, given the choice. Serious? Looking for glory, eh? How foolish, you are? Look at your brother. He's a good exemple... ... of someone, who have for twenty years, looked for glory. Tell him, Bruto. What have you acquired in twenty years, besides your scars? Listen, Menide, you're young... ... and you can have a better life than mine. It can be better. This is your chance. I won't let you miss it. Chance? You call chance, to betray and kill people. Do you prefer to be fighting with the others? You can't be merciful, when it comes to surviving. This world is not a place for the weak. Listen to someone who have more experience. Our plan is precise. Precise in every detail. Why look for trouble? Let's tell Ligonio. - Who give the orders? - You don't need to know it. All you do is to follow the orders given. Are we sure they are fair? In the meantime, we made a mistake, to present ourselves as gladiators. The mistake was the one, you made in the inn. I only left you for a few moments, and you got yourselves in such a mess... ... that I had to pay for it. You'll see, everything will be fine. There can be no suspicious. What are we? Gladiators. What did we come here for? To show off. Everybody believes that you will, only, be fighting in the arena. But our real goal, nobody can imagine... ... especially now, with the confusion that is going on, in the city. Maciste, look. They are the thieves. See, it's the same. Like the other. It doesn't matter anymore, where we founf it. - It doesn't matter anymore? - Go! Only, one thing is important... ... act firmly and only after the order is given. And then, we won't be alone. Tomorrow in the arena, we'll select the others, one by one.... ... those that will cover up the mess. That's it for now. Enough! Enough is enough! That's it for today. Have a rest. What do you want? What do you want, again? I heard you're looking for young men to join. I can be useful. No. I have no job for you. You have already cost me a lot. - You, perhaps. - Huh! Me gladiator? - No, no, maybe in the kitchen. - Ah, I know this one. - Have you hired the other, too? - No. Why not? Let him come. I'll take care of it. Come. Come forward. My friends, we have here a future gladiator. Let's see how brave he is. Get up! Chest out! Head up! Straight up! - You're tired? Want to sleep? - Have a nice landing! He's very brave. It's your turn Sidone. Try it, it's easy. He doesn't understand. His brain doesn't work! He's courageous, no doubts. He can handle the strikes well, but if he spend sometime with us... ... he'll loose the will to defend the weak. Why did you do it? Because a man's life is precious. Cleopatra? Cleopatra? Let's seat here. Cleopatra? Cleopatra? A litlle bit for you. A little bit for me. All right, come. Come with me! It's fine Cleopatra. Come on, give me the satisfaction. Since I can't handle your master... ... I challenge you, monkey face. Ready? Come on! I tell you want you have to do. The palace has three entrances. The least guarded is the stable, which we'll use to go in. Astorige and Bruto will take care of the stable guards. The hall that leads to the queen room, has four sentinels. But only one of them, is awake, per shift. Thus, one must act very carefully. The one that tries to warn them, you will take care of. Tucos and Menide, you'll take care of the others that are asleep. It's not hard. The armour has an opening, over the shoulder. Very simple. Cut their necks. Then there's a staircase, a corridor, and two sentinels. You'll take care of, Fisio. This will give us free access to Talima's appartment. In the room beside sleeps her servant. Take notice that if neede be, they have to die. Only, capture the princess. All of us will attack her personal guards. We have an advantage: surprise! But it will be very dangerous. We're a few. Our opponents are courageous, and fight well. It will be their last fight. We all wish a night like this. They got the map of the palace. And the armour of our guards. How did they get these?! I'll find out. My men and I will go to the underground cells tonigh... ... and exterminate those gladiators. - It won't be easy, Ligonio. - I'm not afraid of them. - But... then after? No! The leader of this conspiracy... ... is the real danger, and remains unknown. That's what we need to discover. Otherwise, he may always try again. No, to face the gladiators now, would be a mistake. And we will remain here quiet... ... until they attack us, when they feel like. Double the guards and choose the better men. That's the only thing we'll do for now. Why do you risk your life? For you, I'll give my life. Then, it is our country. I thank you so much. My father considered you, his most loyal citizen. Now go! They may notice your absence. - Resia! Resia! - What is it? I need to talk to you. Give me a second! At this time? What is it? - Were you sleeping? - No, not yet. Come in! I'm worried Resia. We're surrounded by enemies. People that hate us. - Who? - I don't know. I don't know. I believe they may have opposed our father. I had always suspected that his death was not accidental. Someone is responsible for that fall that killed him. Yes, they, they! I always suspected it. Clinging to the plan to which they have not renounced. Now, they have hired mercenaries... ... to get rid of me. But this time I'll find out the truth. I'll denounce the real culprit. Who put this idea in your mind? Ligonio who sees conspiracy everywhere? Who is always afraid, for your life. No. A man that our father had a great affection for. Maciste! Listen my dear. We have to separate. If something happens to one of us... ... at least, the other will be save. Be alert, Resia. As for me, I don't know. Even though you're not in danger, it's me, who they are afraid of. I am, their enemy. Be alert! Don't trust anyone. Be careful! - When will you leave? - Very soon. Tomorrow maybe. I'll go to the fort of Nadir with a small escort. Nobody should know of my departure, Resia. Forgive me, but I needed to tell you this. - Good night. - Good night. Idiots! They were discovered! Where are you going? - I have to warn them quickly. - What are you going to do now? I ask you, Oniris, renounce to this plan of yours. - I'm afraid. They know everything. - Do you think so? Your sister would have been a very good queen... ... if she had not been betrayed, by family affection. This will cost her throne. - Oniris, give it up. I love you. - I love you too. - And now, more than ever. - Wait! Do you promise not to harm my sister? Remember, if something happens to her... ... I will hate you forever. There will be no reason for that. Have you called me? - We have a filthy spy among us. - Who? Come. - That one! - I'll take care of him. No. For now we'll change quietly what has been planned. If we kill him now, they will suspect us, for sure. Don't worry. Everything is taken care of. Here is something that will make him sleep. Then, his time will come. Right on! - This is the exit to leave the city. - Good. Courtesy of Rufo. Maciste! Maciste! Wake up! They are leaving, Maciste. Quickly, let's move. And that one? I'll take care of him. once we're ready to leave. No, let's do it right. I won't let him live. Menide. Go! Maciste. Damn! Why does he take so long? There he is. Qickly, let's move. - Well? - Done. Let's go! Maciste. Maciste. Maciste. Remember what I told you. You're the only one to know the real reason of my trip. What are these tears for? Don't be afraid. Everything will be all right I'll be back soon. On march! Stop! Go that way! Stop! - A message from the queen. - Give it to me. Get ready, quickly! Follow me. Move! Aren't you ashamed to be among certain people? Dear friend, what's the problem? Hey, Maciste! Did you know what happen? Maciste, watch out! You eat while we fight! The signal. - What happened? - A landslide. You, quickly, help us here. Clear off the road. Talima... Talima Now you know, who give the orders. Anyone who doesn't follow them, will have the same fate. Your task will not be finished... ... until Maciste is dead. How is he? They kidnaped her. They kidnaped her. Poor Talima. what may have they, done to her? Open! Open! It's me, Bango! Oniris has taken control of the city. What about princess Resia? Resia... Resia is his accomplice. Our queen, our beloved princess Talima... ... has been killed. The thiefs who assaulted and killed the escort guards... ... were under Maciste orders. Anyone who helps him or gives him shelter... ... anyone who tries to protect him... ... will be killed and his belongings confiscated. We, the ones that are loyal to the memory of our queen... ... will avenge her. I commit myself in front of the future queen of Mersabad... ... and I won't feel worthy of her esteem... ... in accepting me, as her husband, if I don't succeed in killing all those... ... that are responsible for such an atrocity. Maciste, will be the first. I promise! Go ahead! You'll pay with your life, for having helped Maciste. No! I beg you! Not them! Kill them! Speak! - I know nothing. - Speak, you pig! So, where is the rebel? Where is he hiding in? Speak! Damned murderers. Killing, massacring, murdering... No! Not the beard! Let go of my beard! Murderers, delinquents! Where is Maciste? Where is he? Shepperd! Have you seen anyone passing by? Free all the sheep. So, you don't want to talk? Where is Maciste? You're looking for me? You'll regret to having found me! Let's go! Go away! Go away! What's the hell?! Damn, what is it? Where did you take Talima? Answer! Come on, where did tou take her? Where did you hide her? To the tower, near the river. Stop. Maciste! Look, it's Cleopatra. - I have an idea. - Ligonio, go that way. You two, quickly. Cleopatra! Cleopatra! Come here. Cleopatra, come down! Look, what I have for you. Come! Come down! Come down, quickly! Stop. The rope, good girl. Come down. Now! Good, Cleopatra. Come on, speed up! Cleopatra! Cleopatra! Cleopatra! Right on, right on! Yes! Go for it! Talima. Where is Talima? Where is she now? Where did you hide her, after taking her, from the tower. Answer me? Your sister is alive. No, it's not true. I don't trust you anymore. You have killed her! Your promises were all lies. You took advantadge of me. I believed in your love... ... in your words. - I betrayed her. - I'm telling you, she is alive. - I want to see her! - When the time is right. Now! Otherwise, I'll tell the truth to everybody. I'll turn you in! Even if I have to pay with my life. Come, then. Let's see Talima. - What are you going to do? - Take you to Talima. Don't you want to see her? Are you afraid now? Courage! Stop displaying... ... this insignificant person that you are. I've escaped only because he tought that I had drowned. And your men? They couldn't help. They were attacked by peasants. - How many were they? - I don't know. I only tought to run away from that wild fury. At times, fear plays nasty tricks. If it happened to you, you woudn't have even noticed. He's a very strong man. He could have killed me, as I can kill you. Now, more than ever we need to be united. Our task will be over once the coronation is done. You know this. Then we'll go home with plenty of gold. I assure you. You! Open the gate! Go away! Do you believe now? - Resia! -Talima! Your sister Talima is alive. I have kept our deal. The only thing is none of us expected that so many people... ... would be willing to fight for her. Don't listen Talima. Don't listen! Why do you hide the truth from her? She should know how much love you had for her. I beg you, Talima, do not despise me. She doesn't despise you. She's disappointed. Shut up! Shut up! I order you! Are you behaving already, as queen? Look at her. Look at her well! I will spare your sister for now... ... but her live depends on you. On you, only! Watch out, what you do! - Otherwise, I will not have merci. - Talima! I hate you! Talima... Talima, forgive me... Forgive me! I implore you! - What is it? Aren't you feeling well? - No, no. It's hot! - Do you want to drink? - No. - Are you alone? - No, no. I'm with him. - But that one is old. - What?! I have no racial prejudice. I always liked black woman. - Listen... - No, not here. - All right! - You've been sent by the gods, Ligonio. Princess Resia wants you to know that... ... from anything that you may be willing to do,... ... first of all, save queen Talima. Her life is in danger. - Where is she? - She's in the palace's prison. Save her, quickly! After the chariot's battle,... ... Bruto and Tucos will exhibit in your honor. Let's give a show to our new queen. This is finally the last time, Bruto. Then, we'll go back home. Let's hope so! In the meantime, Menide, Arminio and Rufo lost their lives. What are you caring for? The part that would be theirs, we'll divide among us You forget that Menide was my brother. - Sorry, I didn't want to offend you. - I know, I know. Bruto, I suggest that we go into the arena. Don't worry. I'm also sick and tired of fighting. I let you win quickly, all right? Forgive me, for not being able to protect you. I knew that you would free me. Now, let's go. Bruto, it's our turn! Let's deal with it! What's got into you, are you crazy? Defend yourself! You wanted my part? Now, I'll get yours. You filthy pig! I accuse you in front of the people, to have ordered the conspiracy. To have acquired power, to have trampled on freedom... ... to have ordered the kidnaping of our beloved queen. Kill him! Kill him! Kill him! Long live, Maciste! Forgive me, Talima. The people of Mersabad... ... will judge you. The joy to see you alive, will help me through any sentence. I forgive you, Resia. They're acclaiming you, with justice. We'll always be thankful to you. Your name will become a legend. I only fullfilled my duty as a patriotic citizen... ... serving you and my people. Translation and subtitles -- soumar
