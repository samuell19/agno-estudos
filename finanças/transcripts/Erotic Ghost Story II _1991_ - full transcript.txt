In the beginning there were Heaven, earth and the spiritual world inviolable to each other But Wutung of the spiritual world seized by lust, crossed the boundary Giving himself the shape of a gentle scholar he made advances to three fairies The fairies, in the first stage toward immortality, thus unable to control themselves, yielded to his temptations The eldest of the three So-so is by nature chaste and aloof Wutung feigned to be wounded and begged for her treatment She played into his hands and fell for his lecherous designs She finally offered herself to him The third fairy Hua-hua is the youngest and naivest Wutung played upon her adolescent ignorance and called on his amorous experiences to seduce her He won her heart with stories An overwhelmed Hua-hua also surrendered her virginity On the other hand, Fei-fei is strong in character and would've been hard to conquer Yet Wutung made use of her pride and passion and eventually gained her carnal favors Since their love sessions with Wutung the 3 fairies realized they were losing their power Determind to break off the trap they united to exterminate the demon Though his body has been destroyed Wutung and his lust still drift in the 3 worlds He transplants himself into another demonic body called Chiu-sheng He develops an affair with beautiful Hsiao-yen As it sizzles on, they vow their true love Hsiao-yen is determined to use her true love to cleanse satanic influences from his body and to endow him with human love As the relationship is a sin Heaven sends two accomplished fairies to earth in a bid to wipe out the two and to prevent lust from ruining mankind Hold it! Your choice of Demonland has angered Heaven & earth The 2 are soles apart You'd better reform No, she's imbued with evil. She must be executed Why are you treating me like that? Let me go! Your endless lust for momentary happiness may sow the seed of evil and turmoils Although your sin's unforgivable but if you help me overpower evil and save mankind you may still return to justice and banish lust What's wrong with our true love? A debt of sin You're Sin yourself Please forgive me for the execution then Wutung, you, assumed human shape to induce family girls Many village girls have become your victims and degenerated in the world of lust The evil seed sown by Hsiao-yen and you cannot be a union between the 2 worlds In Heavenly justice, I purgate evil from Hsiao-yen so that her evil seed won't hurt mankind Don't stand in my way Take away her spirit quickly Chiu-sheng Chiu-sheng Help me... Are you all right? Keep the pill of the spirit. Leave now To put an end to wickedness once and for all the nuns incinerate Hsiao-yen's body into ashes and banish what remains of her spirit to earth thus to make her disappear forever How come there's such a birthmark? Let's name her Fang Yu-yin then Since then, Wutung gets increasingly violent He uses his power to bring disaster to mankind To protect humans and animals, the people of Feng Yueh village offer him a virgin girl each month for love-making O all-loving, all powerful Wutung God Bestow good times & crops on our village We submit humbly to your almighty will We, in observation of your order submit a pure virgin to you so that her body may yet entertain you Pray that you shall help us by granting us peace and plenty of animal stock O Wutung, we live in your divine power Please deign to grant our wish Give back my daughter Hope that all disasters go up in a cloud of dust that perils vanish leaving grateful people in the wake May the living live longer and dead ascend to Heaven Never shall one go to hell Auntie, are you all right? Has anybody got any balm? Don't be sad. Crying won't help Village Chief, it is time. Let's set out It's the will of Heaven. Don't be sad anymore How could I not feel sad over giving away a grown up girl to Wutung? He may bless us with one year's luck Whose turn would it be next time?

Over here Over here It's tasteless Again Wutung used magic to get the village girl into a cave where he violated her with abandon There's another female demon in the cave who's two in one with the male demon One picks yin to nourish yang, the other yang to nourish yin They make use of virginal humors to attain ever-lasting life Be gentle, I'll make you comfortable Once intimate with the demon this village girl becomes a walking dead and his sex slave forever Having satiated his satanic lust the male demon still cherishes his lust for Hsiao-yen You two...

Yes Once upon a time there was an innocent little rabbit She was hopping gaily in the forest She came upon a long-neck animal the other day She wanted to know what animal he was So she asked the animal who he was 'Come here' the animal said 'Are you eager to know who I am? "I'll tell you if you go to bed with me' The rabbit said 'No problem' Moments later, she hopped out gaily saying 'So there's a giraffe in this forest' and she hopped happily to and fro Then she met another animal He has a big ear and a long nose Then she asked curiously 'Who are you?' He said: 'Come here, come here' '"You want to know who I am?' 'I'll tell you, but you must go to bed with me first' She agreed This time it lasted longer before she hopped out gaily and said 'So there's an elephant in the forest' Then she hopped happily to and fro again This time she met another animal He has four eyes and six noses She curiously asked him the same question 'Who are you?' He replied 'Come here, come here' She went to bed with him again and it lasted much longer Then she hopped gaily out and said 'So there is On-Na-Ge-Ge in the forest' 'What's On-Na-Ge-Ge? 'What's On-Na-Ge-Ge? You want to know? Come here Daddy, mammy, we're going to bed Hsiao-yen Hsiao-yen's dead In fact, she's an ordinary village girl That was only your illusion Be quiet and let me treat your wound Our union should help heal your wound But your pining has badly hurt your constitution Now I don't have enough yin to revive you You'd better recuperate in the cocoon for the time being I'll go out mating men and catching the girl My battery recharge, I'll cure you Be sure to come back before the cocoon is broken You're so intimate.

All night I looked at you, no wow But wow wow once you look at me Who are you? A high monk - A midget? - No, the Reverend Thank Buddha, we have a way out Don't you know yours is not an ordinary birthmark? It's a magic mark capable of subduing Wutung Please enlighten me, the Reverend Only by uniting with a male virgin you can develop the power. What a pity! What do you mean? I'm the only one in the wilderness How can you find a male virgin? Brother, have you lost your virginity? I'm a true virgin having not even abused myself What a pity! What do you mean?

They say kissing the lobe will help Shan-ken Yu-yin Shan-ken Brother Brother, watch out! Brother, chop its tail Don't kill her Shan-ken Chiu-sheng Hsiao-yen Hsiao-yen Chiu-sheng Hsiao-yen Chiu-sheng Chiu-sheng Chiu-sheng, don't kill them! Take my advice and let them go Why are you still untamed in demonic instinct? They broke into Demonland and killed my female demon She deserves more than that for her evil You can't blame them We have our principles. We indulge in sex to stay alive because there's no distinction between love and sex on earth A devil's a devil. Don't get bewitched! Without the devil's temptation my brother and sister-in-law wouldn't have been in such a state On earth, love prevails over lust In the spiritual world, you get lust and want love too Formerly, torn between the 2 worlds, we couldn't control ourselves Now let's jump out of these and march into the spiritual world of pure love without passion or lust Let's break out of the human, spiritual boundary Hsiao-yen Chiu-sheng, come here Let the fire burn us into one forever and ever If it goes out, we'll part forever Chiu-sheng Red dust flows in this wide wide Heaven, earth A demon rising above lust is human A human being haunted by lust is satanic Who will there be to learn this truth?
