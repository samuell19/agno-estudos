- - [- - - eifansclub - - -] - - Come on, drink up. I don't feel so good. What's the matter? You want to join me? What'd you do to me bitch? Hello, Mr. Alcott. My name is Jacqueline Knight. Mr. Alcott, my name is Jacqueline Knight. Mr. Alcott, my name is Jacqueline Knight. I run an organization called... Rise up. I run an organization called Rise Up. Yeah. Excuse me, is this the Alcott reception? Yes, it is. Oh, I've been roaming these halls for 20 minutes. You know, my invitation says... that it's home on the dining room table. I'm so stupid. Why don't you go in with me? The invitation's good for two unless of course you're here with someone. No, no, I'm not but are you sure I won't be imposing? Please, it would be my pleasure. Well, that's very sweet of you. My name's Jacqueline. Dr. Jacob Griffith. - Pleasure to meet you. - You too. Maybe we can even make an evening of it. Oh, I'd like that. Let me help you with that. - That's a great looking suit. - Well thank you. So Jacqueline, what brings you to this event? Are you affiliated with the Alcott Humanitarian Foundation? No, I've actually never met him. I'm secretly here just to solicit support for a charity group I run called Rise Up. Really, what sort of work does your group do? We work with troubled teens. You know it's a small organization. We just started, but I had a few cases I'm very proud of. Well, that's very commendable. It's always refreshing to meet someone who's more willing to give than to receive. - Yeah. - What about you? You must be associated with the hospital? I'm head of cardiology. 23 years and counting, sat on the board for the past 12. So you must know Mr. Alcott then? Unfortunately not. I was introduced to him once, but since this is the first time that he's donated to our hospital, most of us don't know him well personally at all. They say that he's worth about... Can you please take your seats? We'd like to begin. Shall we go over there? There's a table right there in the corner. To honor and thank our benefactor, Mr. Benjamin Alcott. Tonight, we honor a man whose contributions will help many within the community and countless others far and wide. With his generous contribution, we've been able to fund one of the most aggressive and promised... Just what is Mr. Alcott's background? It's timber. He's one of the biggest suppliers on the west coast. They're big, but not well liked. Environmentalists object to their harvesting practices. Really? Just how large is his company? The company's successful but they're not listed in the Fortune 500. I'm told his personal net worth is around $20 million. Really? Ladies and gentlemen, it is my distinct honor and pleasure to present to you, Mr. Benjamin Alcott. Thank you, thank you very much. You're all too kind, thank you. I'll try to make this brief as I know these speeches can be about as effective as any anesthesia. It is an honor for me to be here tonight to accept this plaque and to help this community. You see many years ago as a young boy growing up I was quite sick. I recall those days very well, the fear and the loneliness I felt through those very troubled days. However, through the help and talent of many doctors and very attentive nurses, I was able to pull through and go on to lead a very productive and now prosperous life. Others like myself were also able to get well and leave. Unfortunately, there were those that didn't. I have learned over the years that it is just too heartbreaking to dwell on those things that cannot be changed. However, it is quite uplifting to focus on those things that can. I hope this contribution makes a difference and thank you all for the opportunity of repaying a debt long overdue. Thank you very, very much. Damn. Oh, I have to go. Well, this is a rather disappointing end to a pleasant evening. Shall we get together again sometime? - No, thanks. - It doesn't have to be so formal. - I don't think so. - We could have a good time. Maybe a quiet dinner together. Look doc, let me get straight to the point. You're an awkward, annoying pain in the ass. Now, why don't you go home to your comfy little house and your wrinkled little wife and fuck her instead? I'm sure she'd really appreciate it. I'd pegged you for a bimbo, but not a cold hearted bitch. Well, you should have been more observant. After all, you're the cardiologist. Sorry. Well, I think that's a wonderful idea. If you'd please call my office tomorrow, we will set up an appointment. - Excuse me, Mr. Alcott. - Yes. - I'm Jacqueline Knight. - Pleasure. I just wanted to say how wonderful it was of you to make such a generous contribution to the hospital. I'm sure they'll be able to help so many people with it. Well, thank you. It was the least I could do. I really wished it could have been more. Oh, on the contrary. It's more than most people give. Yes, I suppose you're right. Well, your modesty suits you well. It was a humanitarian thing to do and I'm sure many will be helped. - It was nice meeting you, Mr. Alcott. - Thank you. Excuse me, Ms. Knight, your bracelet must have slipped off. Thank you. Saved me. Well, now the pleasure is all mine Ms. Knight. - Jacqueline. - Jacqueline. Are you with the hospital? No, actually. I run a nonprofit organization called Rise Up. We help teenagers learn business skills... - Did I say something funny? - No, not at all. I just really wasn't expecting to be solicited the night, at least not by someone like you. However, compared to the usual graceless tackling baldheaded men in three-piece suits, you're very welcomed relief. So by all means, please continue. No, you're absolutely right. It's very rude of me. I'm sorry. It's your party and you should enjoy it. No wait, please, Jacqueline, don't go. I didn't mean to scare you off. You are a breath of fresh air in an evening of dignitaries and I would enjoy your company, that is unless of course you're not alone. No, I'm afraid I am. You know what? Let me do something for you. - Thank you. - That looks a little sad. - Daddy, good speech. - What did you do to your dress? Well, peroxide wonder that you were just talking to ran into me and made me spill my wine. You're not paying attention as usual, huh Candy? Why are you still wearing the dress? Why don't you go home and change? You're embarrassing me. I'm here for you daddy, remember? Yes, but you look like a fool. How do you think that reflects on me? No matter what, it is always my fault. Would you please keep your voice down? Oh, I forgot. We have to preserve the Alcott persona of father, benefactor and saint. You force me to come to these damn things just to maintain your image. That's enough. Go home, Candy. It's time for you to leave. Just sweep it under the rug. I'm sorry, I didn't know you were with someone. Oh no, that's my stepdaughter. She's decided to leave early. I worry about her a lot, but she assures me everything's just fine. - Hey. - Hey. - How you doing, huh? - Okay. So Jacqueline, tell me some more about this group you run. Well, you know I wasn't gonna bring it up again after the reaction you gave me last time. I'm sorry about that. I didn't mean anything by it. It's just that I get approached by a lot of people, and... - and you caught me completely off guard. - I know. I must admit that's the reason I came here in the first place, but after meeting you, I've decided I'd rather get to know the real Benjamin Alcott instead of being another charity case. I don't think I could refer to you as a charity case. Well, I guess I should say thank you. Maybe we should carry this conversation on elsewhere. The cleanup crew's getting little anxious. You know, I know an all night diner. We could hash over some hash browns or get a jump on breakfast. I got to warn you though it's not a very safe part of town. Don't you worry because I'm gonna protect you. And who's gonna protect you from me? I've been trying for the past 15 years and I still can't seem to do anything right. You're just too soft. I guess I have this fantasy that he finally realizes how wrong he's been all these years and you're trying to make up to me. Somehow. He hates me. Hey, you got to think about us instead. Okay, you can't think about him anymore. I told you, I love you and that's all you need. Now, he's just some sorry old man that likes to go around pushing your buttons all the time. But you got to think about our future, and how happy that we're gonna be when he's gone and this place and everything else is ours. Yeah? You start thinking about that instead? I just want to feel like I'm part of a family. We're a family. We're gonna get married someday, and have 12 little kids running around. You can love them all to death. Daddy would hate that. Could you really put up with a father-in-law like him? If it means being with you. I love you. Really? What the... You little tramp! Get up! Get up and get that loser boyfriend out of my house! You better be off my property in less than a minute otherwise I will have you arrested for trespassing. You don't scare me, old man. You can't push me around like you do your daughter, Candy. Who the hell do you think you are Mr. Big Shot, screwing a girl half your age? You don't think I know what you're up to around here loving that meal ticket? I've seen your kind around here before. - Yeah, like in the mirror, right? - What the hell are you talking about? You heard me. I'm not good enough for your daughter Candy, but you were good enough for her rich mom? Candy is a magnet for scum like you. Believe me there's not gonna be any payoff for you around here. There was for you, wasn't there? See if Candy's mom hadn't been killed, oh, excuse me, I'm sorry, died, then none of this would be yours, would it? Get the hell out of my house. I love Candy and I don't care what you think. That is just really touching and you're stupid enough to believe him. Hey, she's not stupid! Get out of here now or I will call the police. Go ahead and call the police. I'll call you later, baby. You are a foolish girl, Candace, foolish and ignorant. - Stop treating me like a child. - You are a child. And until such time that you start making some adult choices, I will treat you as such. From now on, I forbid you ever to see that boy again. That trash is never to set foot in my house. Do I make myself clear? Look, I can hurl you out just as easily as I do him. - Throw me out of my mother's house? - This is my house, remember? I inherited the property, the debt, the business, and of course, you. You've been nothing but a rebellious little tramp ever since. I was only three when you killed mother. - It was an accident. - You were the one who was driving. You were the one who drove off the road. For Christ's sake, it always comes back down to this, doesn't it? - You blame me. - Who else is there? Why couldn't it have been you instead? You know I really have no more patience for this. You are just really sick. I'm glad your mother's not here to see any of this. Stop crying like a baby. You want me to pretend everything is all right when it's not? All you want is a pacifier to make everything okay. I was a child and my mother was gone. I just wanted to be somebody's daughter. Hi. Jackie, it's Ben Alcott. Oh, hi Ben, how are you? Good. Eight o'clock is fine. Sure, I can drive myself. You're so sweet. Don't be silly. I'm perfectly capable of driving myself. Okay. I'll see you then. Bye. I'm perfectly capable. I'm perfect. I am. Here is to the love of mankind and helping those less fortunate than us. To the less fortunate. - You have a beautiful home, Benjamin. - Thank you very much. I can't take all the credit for it. I had lots of help. - Have you lived here long? - Oh, about 25 years. I was the original developer. I thought timber was your business. The businessman who adapts will always find success. My late wife is a very good example. She did these drawings here. - Beautiful, aren't they? - They're lovely. She was very talented. She used her artistic skills to do corporate logos. She adapted. I had the most wonderful time the other night. So did I, Ben. You have to let me know more about you. I did all the talking the other night. Tonight, I want you to have the mic. But your life is so much more interesting. Mine's pretty standard, really. No, no, no, I want to know more about you. Okay, fair enough. Let's see, where should I begin? Well, I'm originally from the Midwest, a little farming community called Platmouth just south of Omaha. We were comfortable, not wealthy. My father owned a good size farm back then. Fortunately, I had a charmed childhood. My mother was an especially great role model. She basically taught me everything I know. So when father died, mother sold the farm and moved to Portugal and I came out to LA where I guess you could say I heard my calling and I decided I wanted to help people so I did a fair amount of charity work and then I started Rise Up. And you're doing well so far? Well, you know we have our difficulties, but we're making a little progress. Thank you. So how would you like a brandy in the living room? I'd like that. It was unbelievable traffic. So I figured the streets are so irregular in Hong Kong that I can cross it quicker on foot. So I grab all the software, I hop out of the limousine and I start running. Turns out I arrive at the meeting 10 minutes early and the competition completely misses the entire thing. Oh, my God. Well you're a remarkable man, Mr. Alcott. - Well, thank you very much. - Let me ask you something. When... Candace, I'm glad you came home. I'd like you to meet somebody. Jacqueline Knight, my stepdaughter, Candace. Nice to meet you. I'm sorry about your dress. I hope it came out okay. Funny, you didn't seem sorry at the time. Candace. Oh, I'm sorry dad. Is she one of the girlfriends I'm supposed to be nice to? Nice to meet you, Kathleen. I'll leave you two alone. Candy, come back here and apologize to Jacqueline. It's okay. I am so sorry about that. Let's not let that spoil our evening, right? - You're right. - Can we pick up where we left off? Of course. I haven't felt this way in years. It's been incredible for me too, Ben. I didn't know I could be this happy. Look, Jackie, there's something I'd like to ask you. I've been giving it an awful lot of thought and... What is it? I realize we haven't known each other a long time but you have completely changed my life. I can't even imagine it without you. What I'm trying... would you please marry me? Wow. Ben, I'd be happy to be Mrs. Benjamin Alcott. - Oh Ben, it's beautiful. - So are you. They're gonna get married. - With that lady? - Yeah. I mean I can't believe that son of a bitch would do something like this. He's only known her a couple months. Don't tell me... - they're in love? - I don't know. I don't really care either. Well, that's definitely gonna affect your future. What another wicked stepparent? Well, think about it. I mean she's gonna be his wife. And then when he's gone, she's gonna get half of your inheritance. That's the money that you deserved your whole life. And then you're gonna have to share your money with that bitch. So Steve, what are we gonna do? This traffic's gonna make us late. I don't think we have anything to worry about. After all, I'm the one writing the check. Yes, you are. How many charities are you involved with right now? Too many. You know, I do it just for good business appearance. As you know, logging's not a very popular industry so I try to balance the negative publicity with some very positive paid PR. Oh Ben, what about all that stuff you said at the Park View benefit? Well, let's just say my secretary writes a very good speech. Frankly, I don't have time for all the details of giving. Wow, I'm not marrying the saint I thought I was. Listen if it's such a burden to you, why don't you let me handle the foundation? With my experience, it's just a natural extension of what I'm doing already. Yes hi, this is Ben Alcott. Give me William Stone, please. Hi Bill, it's Ben. Good, thanks. Look... from now on my fiance, Jacqueline Knight's gonna handle all my duties with the charity. Yes, thank you, two weeks from now and of course, you're invited. Why don't I have Jacqueline come down tomorrow and meet you to sign all the necessary papers? Very good, Bill, thank you. You'll thank me. - Oh honey, you're getting me all wet. - I'm just watering my flower. You know what, these wedding plans are driving me crazy. Why don't we just go to Las Vegas? What? I thought you women lived for all that stuff? Anyway, we have to get to the lawyers to establish the prenuptial. You never mentioned that to me before, Ben. Jackie, I do silly things, but I'm nobody's fool. I know you're not a fool, Ben. I just... didn't think you were that mistrusting. After all, I am gonna be your wife. Come on, Jackie, let's not make a big issue of it, okay? The important thing is we're gonna be married. I don't have a problem with it, Ben. I just wish you'd told me sooner, that's all. I know, I know, I know, I am sorry. So what do you still have left to do for the wedding? Everything. - It's just become such a production. - And you will be the star. I'm ready for my closeup, Mr. Alcott. Listen, I'm gonna go talk to the caterers, okay? and then I'm gonna go to my apartment and pack up. I'll see you tomorrow. It appears that Mr. Alcott suffered a heart attack while swimming. For man of his age, he was in pretty good shape, but sometimes these things are completely unpredictable. I'm really sorry about your loss, Mrs. Alcott. Not quite. We weren't married yet. Candy, I'm really sorry about your father. We had known each other for many years and had become good friends. Anyway, his estate was valued at $20 million and most of it had been willed to various charities he'd become active with. And he left Carmen a year salary. - And? - And that's all. What about me? Did he leave me anything? He left you his complete library, all of his books. I'm his daughter. Candy, please, I know you're upset. He leaves millions to complete strangers and I get nothing. How am I supposed to live off of books? Candy, I'm sorry. You know, those books meant a lot to Ben. You think he was born with his skills and talent? I'll just send over the papers I need you to sign. I know you don't want to discuss this now, but but we need to make arrangements for your father's funeral. Burn him. Steve, it's Candy. Where are you? I need you right now. Call me as soon as you get this. Delivery for Mrs. Ben Alcott. Wedding's off. I don't know where to find her. Los Angeles Mercantile Bank. May I help you? Yes, hi. I wanted to make a donation to a charity that banks with you. It's called Rise Up. I don't really have all the banking information, but a friend told me that I could just mail it to you. - It's called Rise Up? - Yes. One moment, please. I'm sorry, I don't show an active account. We did have an account with them but it was closed on November 6th. Could you please tell me when that account was opened? - October 23rd. - Of this year? Yes, ma'am. So the account has been open less than a month? Yes ma'am. - Are you sure? - Positive. Thank you. Jackie's charity, Rise Up, didn't even exist until after she and daddy were dating. So the solicitation at the gala was all bullshit. Daddy put her in charge of his foundation just two weeks ago. Then Rise Up receives a $300,000 donation from it. That's only one day after Jackie was put in charge. So she used her authority to give herself a big fat bonus, huh? Exactly. Then Rise Up's account was completely drained on November 5th, one day after daddy died. So we get totally screwed by your father and she walks off with $300,000. - No wonder she left so fast. - She has our money, Steve. - What are we gonna do? - We're gonna call the cops. No, the police cannot know about this. Otherwise it's gonna go back to all the stupid charities. Please, just listen to me! - Please, please. - Listen to me. I'm gonna find her, Candy, I'm gonna catch her, and when I do I'm gonna get our money back, okay? All right? Don't you worry about a thing, okay baby? Yeah. Are you sure this is the right place? I don't know, it was in daddy's address book. Yeah, well, there's no Jacqueline Knight. J. Keller matches the initials. 14B. I don't know, what do you think? Well, we're here baby. - Come on, let's check it out, let's go. - All right. Hey! What are you doing? Hey, how you doing? My ex-girlfriend Jackie lives here, and and she's got a bunch of my stuff inside and I've been calling her and she hasn't been answering me. So have you seen her? No, I haven't seen her and I don't want to either. She's a real bitch. She's always blocking my parking space. I don't know what to do. I mean... I ain't seen a thing. Come on. Looks like someone left in a hurry, huh? I knew it. Good afternoon. Santa Barbara Marina Resort? - Who is this? - Santa Barbara Marina Resort. Would you like a reservation, sir? Yeah, yeah, but give me your address first. Why do you have to seduce her to get the money? Did I say seduce? You can't seduce a woman like Jackie. But I'll tell you something, if Jackie thinks I'm rich then I can get close to the money, right? If I can get close to the money, I can get the money, right? And just how are you gonna do that? That's the easy part. Just turn on a Ganse charm, have a little fun with it. Well, don't have too much fun. Hey! Don't worry about it. It looks real, huh? I've had this. Are you sure you're even gonna be able to recognize Jacqueline? You've never even met her. You can't miss a woman like that. Don't worry about it, I told you. I'll take care of it, all right? Hi. I'm supposed to be meeting a friend of mine. Her name is Jacqueline Knight. Could you tell me what room she's in please? I'm sorry, sir, I don't have anyone registered by that name in this hotel. No, no, Jacqueline Keller. I'm sorry, sir, I don't have anyone by that name either. Look, this is the Santa Barbara Marina Hotel, right? Now I know she's here. Maybe she's using her maiden name. So you just check all the guests with the first name Jacqueline or something? I'm sorry, sir. Even if you had the correct name, we don't give out guest room numbers. Just give me a room for two for one night, please. So what if she's not here? Well, we still need a place to rest, don't we? Do you really think she would use her real name? Relax, we'll find her. We're at a resort. We might as well make the best of it. Fuck me, fuck me. Let's go get you cleaned up. - e i f a n s c l u b - I was hoping you could help me. I'm looking for someone. I might have seen her in here. She's a friend of mine. I just need to get in touch with her. She's a piece of work, all right. I saw someone in here who looked a little like her the other night. She was with an older gentleman last couple of nights. What time was that? Eight or nine o'clock. I'll be back. I'll be here. From the gentleman over at the bar. Excuse me, hi. I really don't normally do this and I know women hate it but I was sitting over at the bar and I couldn't help but notice that you have the most beautiful eyes that I have ever seen in my entire life. Okay, I said it. See you later. Wait a second. What's your name? Dan Butcher. Dan, thank you, Dan. - You're welcome. - You want to sit down? - You have nice eyes too. - Thank you. So what do you do? I am a marketing efficiency consultant for pharmaceutical companies. Drug dealer. - Interesting. - Sort of. Listen, are you hungry? I was just about ready to sit down and have some dinner and I would love if you could join me. Why not? So this was September in New Orleans, right? The hurricane was do. We take off anyway. All of a sudden about 20 minutes into the flight, the plane starts shaking right, and this pilot comes on the intercom and says, "No need to be alarmed, folks. This is only turbulence." Then all of a sudden you hear bang, this loud noise outside of the window. I see these two engines, burning up on fire and this plane goes into a nose dive and just books it and plates and drinks flying all over the cabin. And I said to myself, you know, "Here it comes, this is it". "I'm gonna die in a great ball of fire." God, you must've been terrified. You know the funny thing is that nobody screamed. Nobody screamed. All you could hear is the roar of the engines in the background. The plane pulls out of it, people start freaking. I mean it scared the hell out of me. Well I for one am glad you survived. Me too. You know I've always been kind of a lucky guy. Listen, would you mind walking me to my room? I'm sorry, Mr. Ganse, my computer isn't accepting your credit card. - Just run it through again. - I already tried it three times. This is embarrassing. You know the card should work. I'll just charge it to my hotel room then, okay? I'm sorry, sir, we're a different company than the hotel. You know what? I'm gonna turn in, Dan. I'll see you around the hotel. Excuse me. Looking a little red there. Better get some lotion on. Thanks but actually you know I'm out of lotion. Allow me. I hate watching people burn. Thanks. I'm Shelby by the way. Steve, nice to meet you. Are you from LA? Yeah, how'd you know? Most guys from out of state pack a pretty good size gut. Oh, you mean like that guy over there? Actually you're looking, you look a little red yourself there. - Yeah right. - I mean really, come here. Let's see what we can do here. Oh yeah, that's better. Oh yeah. You know, I'm really kind of salty from the ocean. Mind if I come up and use your shower? I don't think my girlfriend would like that very much. Okay, well how about you use the shower at my place? Sorry, still taken. Too bad. Check it out. She's with him. Now explain that one to me, will ya? He's loaded, she's beautiful. Listen, I gotta go. It was really nice meeting you. Mr. Klein, you're too much. Please, call me Luke. This is it. Hang on a minute, Steve. I don't think this is such a good idea. Let me just think a minute. - There she is, hello. - Hi, hi, how are you? How you doing? My fiance locked us out. Could you help us? Honey, how could I have locked us out when you were in charge of the key? You were the last one out the door, remember? No, you're in charge of the keys. I'm sorry, do you speak English? My boyfriend lost our key. Could you help us? Por favor? Thank you. Assholes. Money, money, money, money, where are you? Look, hopefully she has a stash in here. Okay, I mean she'd be stupid to put it in the car, right? Shit, what the hell are you doing here? Help, son of a bitch, help! - He's gonna get us... - Shut up! I'm being robbed! I'm gonna call... Is he okay? How the fuck am I supposed to know if he's okay? Steve, what did you do? Everything okay in there? Hide him. Hide him. Okay, okay go hide in the closet. I'll take care of this. Just go, go, go. Yes, yes! Candy, what the hell you doing? Get off of him! I just saved you 25 years to life in maximum security, jerk. You're sick. Well it worked. I wouldn't talk, I saw you flirting with those bimbos down by the pool. What are you talking about? I was trying to get information about Jacqueline. - Whatever. - Listen, we'll talk about that later. Let's just deal with this guy, okay? Holy shit. I think he's really dead. Oh shit. Wait a minute, wait, wait, I got an idea. Get the trunk, baby. Fuck! - He moved. - What? He fucking moved. - Are you fucking kidding me? - No, I'm not kidding. Watch out, watch out, watch out. Shut up! Shut up! Stay back, watch out. Hold on, don't move, don't move. - Watch out. - Steve. Fuck. Oh shit. Baby, he's stuck. Hold on, hold on. - Hold on. - Steve. I'm just coming, hold on. What's the problem here, folks? Got a little automotive trouble? Officer, no, we're fine, thanks. Hold on just one minute. I've got a tow rope. I can get that thing unstuck for you in a jiffy pot. - You just wait right here. - You know what? We have a 1411 here. I will be off the ground for 1015, assisting civilians, over. Folks don't worry about a thing. I've done this many times before. Sir, I need you to hook that right there. Okay sir, what I need you to do, I need you to pull your vehicle forward and this will dislodge that object from your structure. Okay. Don't worry miss, just stand back. Hey! That's it, we got it. I'll tell you one thing, this tow rope, is one of the best investments I've ever made. 5,000 pound test, durability rating alpha nine, all weather retrieval. I bet the only thing stronger would be your three quarter inch steel cable. But I'm not gonna go lugging a big coil like that around in my safety vehicle. Yeah, it may not look like it but these safety vehicles, they pack some pretty wicked torque. Right after I picked this little beauty up, one of our council women decided to get her Cadillac stuck in one of our flower beds. Tow truck was on the way but I just dropped that sucker right in below. Out pops the caddy. Tow truck guy came, I just told him to go on home. I'll tell you people just don't understand that it's all about leverage. Well you know what, thanks a lot for your help and you have yourself a good night. You know I don't want brag this, to protect and serve. I'm doing my job, sir, - I love my job. - It's a good job. Just like my father and his father before him. You know what my grandfather used to say, definition of a stranger... - is a friend... - Oh, I got to go. - Let me help... - Actually you know what, I got it, I got it. There you go. - Thanks a lot for your help. - He's all yours there, tiger. Okay, you folks drive safe, have a nice evening. - Thanks a lot. - Okay. This is unit 1015 to base. I'm in sector Alpha Victor Charlie, resuming rounds 22:00 hours. Come on, give me your sweater. Where's your sweater? Oh my God, Steve, we're gonna go to prison. Look, we're not gonna go to jail, Candy. - You just killed somebody. - Well I didn't mean to. Look, I think we pulled it off, all right? What we need to do now is we need to think about how we're gonna get Jacqueline's money. I can't believe you're talking like this. Somewhere that dead man has a family. You feel that guilty, we can give the police a call after we've left town, all right? Now unless you want to live the rest of your life in a trailer park, I suggest we go back to the hotel and we finish what we started. What are we gonna do, Steve? Your Ganse charm isn't exactly working the wonders you said it would. We're just gonna have to keep trying, okay? Everyone has a weakness. We're just gonna have to try something else. Trust me. Room 319, please. I'm sorry, ma'am, that room is empty. Mr. Klein checked out this morning. Thank you. Hey. Debra. How you doing? It's me Dan Ganse, remember? - Well, how could I forget? - God, you look great tonight. Look, Mr.... Richard or Ganse, whatever your name is, I don't really feel like having company tonight, so why don't you just leave me alone, all right? Listen, I would leave you alone but I would like the opportunity to make this up to you because I have to apologize for the other night. It was... I don't think so. Look, I just want to buy you dinner. Maybe you can just relax. Look pal, you're not my type, so why don't you go back where you came from, all right? You know Deb, I think you're getting a little bit obnoxious yourself - because I... - You heard the lady. Look old man, why don't you go back to your table... Young man, if you continue your obnoxious behavior, the bouncer is gonna break you like a toothpick and throw you out on your ass. Why not spare yourself the embarrassment and leave now? Fuck you old man. And you too, bitch. Well, thank you very much. - My name's Debra. - Henry Maxwell, my pleasure, Debra. Pardon me Mr. Maxwell, do you mind if I join you? Didn't I overhear you say you wanted to be by yourself tonight? Yes, but that was before I was rescued by a knight in shining armor. I'd love your company, Debra. But I gotta warn you up front, I'm a married man. Oh, what did you think I was gonna do? I just want to buy you a drink. - I'd love a drink. - Okay, good. Beauty has two edges, one of laughter, one of anguish. - Shakespeare? - Virginia Woolf. - What are you having? - Scotch and water. I'll have the same. So Debra, what's your business here in Santa Barbara? I was recovering from a bad situation. It was almost working too. - What about you, Mr. Maxwell? - Please, call me Henry. I come here once a year from Texas, stay about a month. A Texas man, huh? What's your business? If I tell you what I do, you'd think it's boring. Well, try me. I'm an investment banker. You're right, that's boring. I'm just kidding. I mean, it's great for you. How many Texans get to spend their winters in Santa Barbara? I'm lucky, I know it. I'm just a little disappointed my family couldn't make it this time. Why not? My kids are all grown. They're living their own life. My wife's on a cruise in The Bahamas. She hates California. Oh, what a shame. Yeah, it is. I wish she liked it here. Four weeks can get a little lonely by yourself. Yeah. Well, I think I'm about ready to turn in. - It's a pleasure to meet you, Debra. - It was a pleasure meeting you. and thanks again for saving me. You know if you haven't made plans for tomorrow night, would you be interested in having dinner together? - I'd like that. - Good. Why don't we meet in the lobby around seven? Seven it is, I'll see you there. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Nice job, Steve. Hope you didn't get roughed up too much. Perfect end. We're set to have dinner tomorrow night, seven o'clock. You the man. Candy, I want you to meet the man who taught me everything I know. Well, not everything I know, but this is Max Delanay. Max, this is Candy. My pleasure, Candy. Thanks for helping us out. Allright. That's enough, that's enough. - Have one of them, huh? - Thanks. So tell me about the money situation. Well, we figured that Jacqueline made off with about $100,000 of Candy's father's money. but since the money's stolen, we figured she must be carrying it around with her unless she's stashed it close by. Well if I find I, I'm taking half. Like hell, you're taking a third like we agreed. You ain't changed, Steve. I'm just riding you. I like watching you get pissed off. Don't worry, it's in Santa Barbara, I'll find it. You two better get some rest. You don't look so good. Goodnight. Jesus, Steve, are you sure we can trust him? Well, baby, we have to. He's the best chance we got. Come on, Max has been like a father to me. He gave me my first beer for Christ sake. Well, he's smooth. I hope you know what you're doing. If anybody can con a con, it's Max. Now, don't worry, okay? Max is a good guy. Trust me. Trust me, trust me, trust me. Yeah, well, we searched the damn car and the entire room, Max, and we found nothing, okay? I'm getting a little pissed off here, and this fucking heat doesn't help things. - Patience, Steve. - No, Max, I don't have any patience. Give it some time. She's building trust in me. She's gonna let her guard down one of these days and we'll get our prize. Well, you know, Max, Candy and I don't have any more money. So we can't finance your little romantic ventures anymore. So just do me a favor, will ya, and put the squeeze on her a bit, okay? I'll see what I can do. What's so funny? Debra, you have changed my life dramatically. Three weeks ago, I was a faithful husband to a 30 year marriage and now look at me. Bullshit, Henry. You think I don't know your plan? I know who you are. I knew you were a womanizer the night we met. You're such a good one. That's why I like you so much. Debra. Am I wrong? So maybe you have a wife at home. If you think I'm gonna believe I'm the first woman you've fooled around with since you've been married, you've been spending way too much time in the sun. Debra, I gotta hand it to you, I've been had. Give me a minute to rebuild my ego. Don't pout, Henry. Whatever you have at home isn't gonna affect us here. I have to go to New York for the weekend before I return to Texas. I'm not ready to say goodbye. Come with me. We'll stay at a top-notch place in the city. You can relax, do what you want to do during the day. Just save the nights for me. You know I make it up to New York quite often. Perhaps we can meet there on a regular basis. You're asking me to be your mistress. Why not? - When do we leave? - Tonight. - I can't. - Why? Well, I got things to take care of here. That's what telephones are for, my dear. I really have to do this in person. Okay, how soon can you leave? How's tomorrow morning? - Tell me what I can do to help you and I'll do it. - You know what? Just give me a little space, okay sweetie. I have a lot to think about. - Hyland Motel. - Steve Ganse room, please. Hold on. - Hello? - Yeah, we're set. Can I ask you something? Yeah baby, anything, you know that. How'd you meet Henry? Henry took me in when I was a kid. Gave me a home when I needed it most. Yeah, but how exactly? It's a long story, baby. I think we'll have more, there she is. I'll be back. Write this down, B937. What's that? That baby, is a locker. There's a suitcase in there. All right, get down, get down. - Shit, I think she saw us. - Be cool, okay, be cool, it's okay. Just be cool, just be cool, okay? It's okay. - This is it, baby. - Shit, shit. Give me another kiss. It's got to be the money, Max. Where else could she put it, huh? All we need is the key, and I saw her put it in her purse. I'm not saying the money's not in there, there's probably more. If we steal it from here now, she'll know somebody's onto her and she'll just disappear. Yeah, well, that's good, 'cause once I get my money - I don't care where she goes. - See, that's bad. You ever watched "Let's Make a Deal"? You can take what's in the box and walk away, or you can gamble the box for what's behind curtain number two. If that suitcase hasn't got the money, then you're gonna be double screwed. - You won't have a cent and she'll be gone. - Yeah? I'll take what's behind the box, buddy. - Where have you been? - I had some calls to make. Candy, baby, you gotta let me know where you're going. I was worried about you. Oh yeah, I can tell by the way you're basking in the pool. Daddy's ashes were scattered today. Is that okay with you or did you want to approve it first? I'm sorry. I didn't know. - We're not done here. - Yeah, we are, Max. Just get the key and I'll do the rest. Okay kid, you win. I'll meet you back here at your room, - no later than one a.m. - One a.m. Thanks for dinner, Henry. Do you want a nightcap before you go? I certainly do. Let me get some ice, all right? I'll be right back. What are you doing? I got a tremendous headache. I was just gonna take a couple of your aspirins. Those are not aspirin, Henry, those are sleeping pills. Sorry, I just, - I should have asked first. - Yes, you should have. I'm a little picky about my privacy. Okay, so if you'd respect that. The aspirin are in the bathroom. I guess I really need a drink. I guess so. I'm gonna make these a little stronger. - Henry! - They seem a little weak. What's the matter with you? I'm just anxious about New York. I'm sorry. I want to make you happy. You do? Well then you're forgiven. - Here's to New York. - To New York. You son of a bitch. It takes five minutes to get here and he's over an hour late. Look if he said he was gonna be here, he's gonna be here. That's not him. He's making suckers out of us, Stephen. What else besides his word would keep him from picking up the money himself and taking off? - His word is good. - It's a lot of money. Stay if you want. I'm going to the bus station. Wait, wait, I just think we should just stay together until this is over, okay? - Okay then, it's over. - Wait, wait, wait a minute. Steve, Candy, I thought we were supposed to meet back at the hotel. We thought so too, Max. Hey, I know this looks bad. You got to believe me, - I was on my way right over there. - That's a nice try. Things didn't go as planned. She caught me going through her purse and flipped. I had to knock her out. You didn't kill her? Of course not, I just hit her. Look, she caught me going through her stuff. There wasn't much time. If I hadn't come straight to the money first, she might've beat me to it. Then where would we be? That's good, Max. You're a fucking squid! Steve, you think I'm trying to fuck you guys over? Oh no, no, no. Give me a break here, we're family. You're a liar, Max. That means you forfeit the money. - You can't do that. - Yeah? Watch me. Get the suitcase, baby. The suitcase stays. No! You lost it, Max. Why'd you do that to me, huh? You lied. No! Careful there, Jack, you don't want to break a nail now, do you? Dan, Dan, we could be good together, huh? Please. That money over there, there's lots more where that came from. Buenos Aires, we could take the first flight down. I'll tell you what Jackie, I'm gonna take the money but you know what? I can help you with that trip down there. Could you pull over here? I want to get cleaned up. You sure you don't need the hospital? No, not now. I kind of want to put some distance between us and you might as well fill up. I'll be right back. - You sure you don't need anything? - No. That fucking bastard. No! Son of a bitch, no, no. Son of a... No, son of a bitch, no! Son of a... Thanks daddy. subtitle by - eifansclub -
