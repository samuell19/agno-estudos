PUERTA DEL PARIAN YEAR OF 1782 Intramuros Behold the past Behold A fading glory Intramuros Manila of another age The eastern jewel of Spain Then everything changed Another flag was raised Gladly, a world of modernity Was embraced Intramuros The city we left behind An ancient way of life We abandoned Intramuros Manila of another age Intramuros A story long forgotten! Hey. - Let me have the camera. - What? I'll go alone. - Let me take care of this. - I'll hold this. Just stay here. Amidst the squalor of the city there was a house that withstood the cruel hand of time. When you enter its weathered door, you step into yesterday's beauty... and ceremony. Candida. Bitoy? Bitoy Camacho. You've grown up! I'm now 25. You have not changed. Yes, I have. The last time you saw me, I was a proud young lady with big dreams. So sure that my Prince Charming would come. And did Prince Charming come? Not at all. No one ever comes. Not even on Friday evenings? There are no parties anymore. The old people are dying. Oh, no. Paula! Paula, Bitoy is here! Bitoy? Those parties... You remember them? I always accompanied my father... You were just a child. Saturdays in Binondo, at the Monson's house. Mondays in Quiapo, at Dr. Moreta's pharmacy. Wednesdays in Carriedo, at Don Aristeo's bookshop. And Fridays here At the Marasigan house More brandy, Don Pepe? More brandy, Don Isidro? It's cooler here by the window, Donya Upeng Donya Irene, the poem of the great Ruben The talk of the town "Your grandmother with her graying hair... is wiser than you with your unruly curls." Here you go, Don Aristeo Some brandy for him, Paula Politics are a forbidden topic here Yes, Donya Irene We often watched that company's musicals Please, Don Alvaro, tell us more about General Aguinaldo. He didn't want to listen to General Aguinaldo. - Is that it? - Yes. When did your father paint it? About a year ago It's extraordinary! He called it "Retrato del Artista como Filipino." "Portrait of the Artist as a Filipino." But why? The scene here is not Filipino What did your father mean by it? An old man on a young man's back And behind them A burning city Our father is the old man Our father is also the young man Our father back when he was a young man Yes... And the burning city? The burning city is Troy, right? I see you know the story Aeneas carried his father, Anchises When they escaped Troy He painted himself As both Aeneas and as Anchises! As he is now and as he used to be. The effect is disturbing. So, you feel it too? It's like I'm seeing double. I sometimes feel that it's a monster A man with two heads Did you know That a Frenchman has written An article praising the portrait? He is a long-time admirer of our father They met in Madrid and Barcelona Tell me, Bitoy, are you a newspaper reporter? Yes, I am. So, that's why you came to visit! People come here, not to visit us But to see the portrait You should be happy You should be proud Most people thought Your father died some time ago But now, after so many years Everybody is talking about him The whole nation is excited To discover that Don Lorenzo Marasigan The great painter The friend and rival of Master Juan Luna Is not only alive But has also painted Another masterpiece Even in his old age He painted this portrait For Candida and me For a whole year it hung here in peace Until the Frenchman wrote about it. We've had no peace since then. Everyday, a new reporter, or photographer, or a student comes here. And we do not like it We do not like it, Bitoy Forgive me. I should go now. No, Bitoy. Stay for a while. Paula, bring another cup. - People are waiting for me. - Sit down, Bitoy. Here, Paula. Tell Father that Camacho's son is here. How is your father, Don Lorenzo the Magnificent? He is well. Is he too weak to leave his room? - He had an accident. - When? - A year ago. - When he painted the portrait? After he finished it. We did not see it happen. It happened at night He must have been sleepwalking. And fell off the balcony And onto the courtyard My God! Was he injured? No, thank God! And how is he now? He has not left his room in a year And, of course, we blame ourselves But why? You said it was an accident An accident... Come, Bitoy. Father's delighted you are here. You can see him now. Thank you, Paula. You are not a reporter. You are a friend. You are not here to photograph or interview him. You are only here to visit him. Yes, Candida. - Thank you, Paula. I'll be quick. - Yes, he is waiting for you. They're enjoying their conversation. Father seems to be getting better. Our bills? Gas. Water. Doctor. And this, the electricity. "Unless this account is settled immediately, service will be discontinued." It's their third notice. Have you told Manolo? I called him and I called Pepang. They said they'd send us money, but it's already been a month. Our dear siblings. They want us to give up this house. They can't force us to do that. We were born here, we will die here! But what if they refuse? I have an idea. Good afternoon, ladies! Look at that, it's snack time! Care for some hot chocolate, Mr. Javier? That is not good business. I'm only paying for the room. Paula, another cup. What for? I can use this cup. Mr. Javier, put that cup down now. Thank you, Miss Paula. Here's to bad business! Mr. Javier, you are shameless! Delicious. It's useless to treat you with decency. Allow me to remove my indecent self from your sight. Thank you for the chocolate. Mr. Javier, we need to talk. What about? I must take this to the kitchen. Stay here, Paula. What do you want? I'd like to rest before I go out again. I'm very tired. I need to sleep. I study all day, work all night. I'm very ambitious. Look at me, a two-bit vaudeville piano player. I'm not a pianist. You know the difference between a pianist and a piano player? I'll tell you. A pianist studies in a conservatory He gives concerts for high society A pianist is cultured While a piano player like me I'm self-taught and I know I play poorly Banging on the piano In a cheap vaudeville Three shows a day in a cheap theater A place where the audience Spits on your back A place where the cheap piano Rattles like a can And you never know How long The job will last Mr. Javier! When we allowed you to rent a room There were conditions No gambling or drinking No women in your room So? You have broken our rules. I don't gamble. I'm not talking about gambling. - I may bring a beer now and then... - Nor about drinking. You mean... Exactly. Hey, hold on. One... Who are you? I'm Susan. I'm Violet. We're artists of the Parisian Theater. Stars of the stage. Gems of vaudeville! What are you doing here? We wanted to see where you live. - You've seen it. Now, scram! - Don't talk to me that way. We'll stay as long as we like. Susan, you're drunk. Go home. We have a show in an hour. Take your hands off me! I'll go home when I damn well please! Susan... - Why are you causing trouble? - You know why. Did I do something? Where were you last night? Where did you go after the show? I had a headache, so I came home. Tony? Hey, my friend! - How are you? - Why are you here? You two know each other? We worked together at the pier. What are you doing here? I live here. You're kidding! We are renting out some of the rooms and Mr. Javier is our first... Candida! A rat! There's a rat in the kitchen! It's as big as a cat! They're both crazy. They're old family friends. You'd better stay away from them. They are man-hungry. Why? Have they tried eating you? They're both crazy! They quiver when I look at them, get feverish when I talk to them, and if I touch them... Did you woo them? Woo them? I'd rather make love to the Jones Bridge! They're the crazy ones, not me. They've become poor. See that portrait? I know an American who's willing to buy it for $2000 dollars. Dollars, mind you! I've been trying to convince them. You? I was hired as a middleman. And what happened? Perhaps they love the portrait too much. They hate it. How do you know that? I hate it myself. That damned thing stares at me, looks down on me, scoffs at me. Even in my room, I can feel his smile mocking me. Are you talking about the portrait... or the crippled painter? You just came from the room of Don Lorenzo the Magnificent. I've been here for months and I've never been invited to his room. So one day, I went in. - And he threw you out? - No! He was very polite. I told him about the American who wants to buy his masterpiece... and he just smiled. "It belongs to my daughters, not to me." "Anyone interested in buying it will have to talk to them." Then he said he wanted to take a nap. So, I had to leave the room. He's going to pay. I'm going to make him pay. And I know exactly how I'll do it! Why do you want them to sell so badly? Because of the commission the American offered me. Ladies, did you catch the rat? Of course, Mr. Javier! My sister never fails. The champion rat-catcher! You could say I'm an expert. How do you do it? I have a talent for it. An extraordinary talent! And I plan to earn from my talent. Violet, take Susan home and put her in the shower. No! We want to rehearse. - Rehearse what? - Our number for later. We could've practiced last night if you had stayed. Fine, let's be quick. A-tisket a-tasket Put it in a basket Then put it in your pocket Just don't ask why A-tisket a-tasket Put it in a basket Then put it in your pocket Just don't ask why - Quiet down, our father is sleeping! - Okay, time to go. I don't want to! Go home! - Why? Who are they? - Do they own this whorehouse? I know what kind of women they are! I saw you bring That Chinese matron here Shut up! We know We all know What kind of house you run here Get out of here! - Come on. - Please, just... I'll leave as well. I'll tell my friends your father was asleep. Will you be back? Of course I will. Mr. Javier is amusing, is he not? We should not believe those drunken women. Besides, we need his rent money. I know what we'll do. Look at this "Fifty cents for every rat caught" I will go to... where is the Bureau of Health and Science? Imagine that, I'll get paid For doing something I really like to do And you you will give piano and Spanish lessons We will put up a sign outside Lessons for whom? Piano lessons for girls And Spanish lessons for men But they will laugh at me If any man disrespects you You call the police We will make a lot of money They cannot force us to leave We will show Pepang and Manolo That we can maintain This house on our own We will not be afraid anymore We will not be afraid anymore We will stay here Until the day we die You, me and Father He will get well And come out of his room We will be happy once again The three of us together till the end Life was blissful then Everyone dressed so well The breeze felt like a caress Back when our life was ideal Poetry was our breakfast And songs embraced our nights Art was our constant companion Back when life was ideal Beauty and truth Are my sword and shield from the world No fears, no sorrows Through the floods and storms Can we ever bring back Those days? With beauty and truth I can take on the world I have no fears, no sorrows Come what may We were happy then. Why did we ruin our happiness? Why did Father have that accident? Why did he paint that portrait? Candida, the lights aren't working. Try again. I did, many times. Try the stairway. I'll try the hallway. - No lights in the stairway? - None - How about the hallway? - None No light in Father's room My God, Candida! They've cut off our electricity Call Manolo and Pepang Call the electric company Be quiet! Where do you want me To go make the call? Our neighbors probably know by now That our electricity has been cut Because we have not paid our bill My God, Candida! Go shut all the windows! The neighbors will see me! I know what they are saying Look at those uppity ladies They cannot even pay their electric bill How can we ever face them again? Close the windows! They will see us! Perhaps no one has noticed That we have no electricity There are no lights. None? -All the houses are dark -Dark? The streets are dark What happened? We are so stupid! What happened? Nothing happened! What do you mean? It was probably in the newspapers, the ones we do not read! What was in the papers? There is a blackout drill tonight They are preparing for war And we actually thought... We were so afraid to close the windows We were afraid Our neighbors would see us We are a pair of half-wits! A pair of idiots. We are so pathetic! Candida! I can't take it any longer! The hero of our childhood, Manolo -Father was more than that to us -He was our God Our earth and sky Our Moon, Sun and stars Our whole universe It was wonderful To have a genius for a father No, it was cruel But it's painful To turn your back on your hero Look at Don Aeneas carrying his own father Is this what Father thinks? That we left him to care for himself? Stop it, we have not neglected him He still has Candida and Paula They are probably at the market Getting crazier and crazier We must talk to them Remember, you promised to be firm - Where is Don Perico? - He's still in Father's room They are still talking Candida and Paula will listen to him Because he is a senator - No, because he is a poet. - That was a long time ago. He is their godfather We need him to persuade them To leave this house I have a buyer. I told you, I already have a buyer! You stay out of it, I am the eldest I have no confidence at all In the business skills Of the men of this family What about the furniture? The chandelier is mine And the marble table in the study You can have all the furniture In the living room, e xcept the piano The dining room set is mine We can divide the silver and the plates What for? Why don't you just take everything? Fine, thank you. Take the floor and the stairs Take the walls And the roof, it's all yours! Are we going to fight Over o ld tables and chairs? Excuse me... But you already gave me these old chairs Don't tell me I still have to fight for them You know my Mila Is getting married next year She will need furniture My Roddie is getting married this year And he will get the furniture I will take all the furniture Here in the living room And those in the dining room And those in the bedrooms Including all the books And cabinets in the study And the big mirror downstairs too And the matrimonial bed The matrimonial bed is for my Mila Try taking anything out of here Without my permission And why do I need To ask for your permission? Who has been paying to maintain This house for the last ten years? I pay my share too -Only when you remember -Well, sometimes I forget Sometimes? I have to remind you every month When it's time to pay If I left it up to you Father would starve I am ashamed To ask my husband for more He always asks me "Why is your brother not supporting them?" You never have any money for them But you always have plenty To throw away at the races And for your mistresses Enough! You tell that smug husband of yours... Stop it! She's here. -Let's stop this -There you go again, Manolo Let them stay if they want We cannot support them anymore Really? You can't afford it? Whether we can or cannot Is not the question This old house has gotten on my nerves I admit I feel the same way Candida will live with you Paula will come live with me What about Father? -With you, if you wish -With you, if he wishes As long as Candida stays with you And Paula stays with me So you can have a maid To look after your house While you play mah-jongg With your society friends? So your wife can have somebody To look after your house While she socializes In clubs and committees for whatever? Poor Candida. Poor Paula. We have been supporting them all these years. Poor Candida Poor Paula Has my wife arrived, Pepang? - Is she coming? - I told her to come pick me up. The President needs me in Malacañang at 1:00 p.m. We have pressing matters to discuss. Come, sit down, Don Perico. Paula has just arrived. Manolo, go get her. How is Father doing? He has gone to sleep. Pepang, what happened to him? I should have visited him sooner. Has he changed so much? He's the same as ever. Still sharp-witted and articulate. And yet, something is missing. I feel something was lost. How serious was his accident? It was serious enough. But we had the best doctors examine him and he's getting better. What did you notice, Don Perico? It seems like he's lost his will to live. How are you, Godfather? Is this Paula? Wow! You were little the last time I saw you. It has been a while since your last visit. We in government have little time for ourselves. Congratulations on your victory in the last elections. Now, I can help you and Candida. Thank you, Godfather. But we do not need any help. You should listen to him. Paula, are you willing to make a sacrifice for your country? What kind of sacrifice? The portrait Your father's last masterpiece If you were to donate it to the country The government will As a sign of gratitude Will put up a fund To be administered by the two of you For you, Candida and your father While he is still alive He cannot object because the money is not being offered to him but to you. Listen, Paula, this would be a precious gift for our country. We do not own a single painting by Don Lorenzo the Magnificent, whose great works are in the museums of Spain and Italy. Of course, Don Perico, Paula and Candida need to discuss it first. There's nothing to discuss. Candida! Is this Candida? How are you, my child? Do you still remember me? I do remember you. And I'm afraid you're wasting your time. We will never part with the portrait. Be quiet and listen to him. Wait a moment, Candida. Are you angry with your old godfather? I understand that your father painted it for you, but if you really love your father, you should consider his welfare. He is not doing well. He needs sunshine and fresh air. He needs good doctors. He needs proper medical care. That will be expensive. If you accept our government's offer, you will have the means to take care of your father. But he is not sick. You don't understand. No hospital can cure him. - What? - What do you mean? A war is coming and Intramuros is the most dangerous place to be in. Tell them, Senator! Go ahead, Godfather. Tell us, should we abandon this house the same way you abandoned your poetry? Go ahead, Godfather. Tell us what to do. We will do whatever you think is best. Pepang, let me take care of this. But think very carefully Our lives are in your hands But must you even think about it? You have long abandoned this house Back when you abandoned your poetry Back when you abandoned our genteel past Did you ever regret your decision? No! What a foolish question! One only has to look at you now You are rich! Highly respected by everyone Including the President! The esteemed senator does not respond. Candida, Paula, I have no right to advise you. Why not? We once listened to your poetry, we will listen to your advice now. A senator's word has more weight than a poet's. What was I supposed to do? Continue writing verses while my family starved? Bury myself alive the way your father did? What does he have show for all those lost years? A portrait? That masterpiece? Is it enough to justify what he's done to the both of you, Paula? I am not the reason for your anger. What have I ever done to you? Nothing, Senator But what have you done to yourself? Life, like art Is intricate Charting paths Carved by a greater force We do not possess The future We are but bystanders making side bets and propositioning fate I never said I planned on giving up poetry I had no political ambitions In my youth I followed my ideals I never craved wealth Nor did I ever desire to hold The reins of power Life, like art Is intricate Charting paths Carved by a greater force We do not possess The future We are but bystanders Making side bets and propositioning fate We are but bystanders Making side bets and propositioning fate Forgive me, Godfather. It is you who must forgive me. Remember this, I did not kill the poet in my heart, he was meant to die, because all death is fated. Who died? Hello, Manolo! Hello, Pepang! Had I known you were here I would have come sooner Are these Candida and Paula? Your late mother was a dear friend of mine Do you remember me? Of course, Donya Loleng This is my youngest, Patsy And this is Elsa Montes The Elsa Montes! She brought Conga to Manila And this is Charlie Dacanay Who does nothing productive in life Other than following us around How is your Father? He is taking a nap, Donya Loleng Please, say, "Hello," for me Yes, Donya Loleng And is this the portrait Everyone is talking about? Come here, all of you Study this work of art You must give us Your opinion, Miss Elsa Having lived in New York You must be an expert In appraising works of art Well... My... What a beautiful inspiration. Inspiration? I see an evening gown In that man's costume The same cut, draping and color Even the frame's design could be copied Imagine those in gold What a fabulous design! And that belt with all its frills We must copy everything I will wear it while dancing the conga And what material would you use? Chiffon or satin Velvet or taffeta Just leave that to your dressmaker Who are those two guys anyway? -Aeneas is the one carrying the old man -And the old man he is carrying? That's Anchises, his father And who are they? The Artist and his conscience. What is that? Just an air raid drill. Everybody stopped moving. The people and the vehicles. Practice blackouts, practice air raids. Even practice evacuations. I'm tired of practicing. I wish the real war would start! War to start? That can't happen. I just got a new gown for the New Year's ball. Papa! Stop the Japanese invasion. Let's just party and dance. Much better than a war Much better, much better Much better than a war! War or no war, we are going to the ball. Will the Manila Hotel still be open? It'll remain open no matter what. No war will stop you. What? What do you mean? Even earthquakes will not stop your mah-jongg games, even if a tea cup breaks or a mah-jongg table loses a leg. After the earthquake, we buy a new cup, buy a new table and the merriment continues. Pepang, what have you done to him? My dear, what can one do to a corpse? - Whose corpse, Papa? - I have just discovered that I have been dead for the last 30 years. Perico! Patsy, get your Papa's hat. We need to leave immediately. Something in this house is making Perico ill. Is the senator sick? Don Perico is sick? He is having a poetry attack! Mother of God! Candida, Paula. Stay by your father's side Stand with Lorenzo Even against the world Do not worry. An aspirin, some hot soup, an afternoon nap and he will be back to normal. Goodbye, my friends! Poetry cannot stand against aspirin. Defy the world, Paula. Defy the world, Candida. The old man double-crossed us You heard his advice We promised to do whatever he said We will stand with Father And defy the world "Defy the world" That's what he said Wait! Are the rumors true? What rumors, Pepang? That they are infatuated With their male tenant What did you say? A hard-up, uneducated man A vulgar vaudeville musician A notorious scoundrel! You are destroying Our family's good name Imagine if Father hears about these rumors Now I understand why the old man is ill Father was never sick! You don't know anything! What don't we know? What have you been hiding from us? He wants to die! He tried to kill himself. - You said it was an accident. - He jumped off the balcony! My God, why? Because we confronted him We blamed him for our hardship We told him he wasted his talent Why couldn't he be like Don Perico? We could have married well And lived much better lives What did he say? -Nothing -What? -He painted the portrait -Then gave it to us So that you could sell it That portrait is your only hope! On our way out, he said... "Farewell, Candida." "Farewell, Paula." That's it! You need to be separated from him. He will never recover living with the two of you. We will place him in a hospital. And you will come live with us. We betrayed him, just like you betrayed him. We must atone for all our sins. That's enough! Come, Pepang. Remove the signs outside And dismiss your tenant immediately! Pepang! Was your mission successful? They made fun of me. They didn't believe you were good at catching rats? They treated me like I was crazy. Candida... Pepang is right We are both completely useless We must separate Candida... I will take care of Manolo's children And manage their kitchen I will take care of Pepang's laundry I will wash her hair She will make you wear her old clothes Manolo's wife will make you cut your hair Is there nothing else we can do? You heard what Pepang said This portrait is our only hope If we sell it My God, Candida! - Candida, Paula! - Damn it. I do not want to see him now I have the solution to all your problems. What do you mean? Sit down and listen. Be quick, We still have cooking to do What is it, Mr. Javier? The American I told you about, he's going back to the States. The Americans are being sent home before the war starts. And well, he still wants the portrait. He wants to take it back with him and the price he's offering, listen carefully, Ten thousand! - Ten thousand dollars? - That's twenty thousand pesos! The guy really wants the portrait. We will think about it. Don't think about it too long. He's leaving on Friday. In two days? We are very sorry, Mr. Javier But we've told you before Father's portrait is not for sale What? Are you both crazy? This is the chance of a lifetime. You mean It's the chance of your lifetime - Mine? - How much did he offer you? I will admit, it was a lot. We are sorry But you are not getting that money Miss Candida, tell Miss Paula she's acting crazy! I must go start dinner You talk to her Don't leave me alone. Why? Are you afraid? Afraid? That the rumors are true. You know they are not. Then tell me, why are you afraid to stay? Why do you keep clinging on to me? I am not afraid. I do not need you! We do not need each other. You have decided. I'm very sorry, Miss Paula. I suppose you know what you're doing, but... Twenty thousand pesos! My God! If I had that money, I would start my own band. I'd play all over Hong Kong Shanghai, Java and India I'd go to Europe To really learn how to play the piano I'd go to Paris To Vienna, to New York Paris Vienna New York To Spain, Italy, South America I wouldn't go there just to have fun I would really learn I'd devour their culture I have always dreamt Of traveling around the world You can make your dreams come true Turn them into reality I have lost all hope I am not young anymore We could go together to Europe You can have everything you desire Is that still possible? Is it not too late? Miss Paula... Do you like me, even a little bit? You must not talk like that What would people say? Who cares what people say? I really despise them! Then show them your contempt To hell with what they say! You can pack your bags right now And go wherever you want My dreams are all dead You can still bring your dreams Back to life You really think so? If someone comes along And says the right words He can mend Your shattered dreams I am tired of waiting. Miss Paula Look at me. Don't, Miss Paula. Forget him. Turn your back on him. Leave him behind. No! Not here! Not in this house! Hey, wait! Dad! - Candida. - It's you. I saw you and Paula at church. I came ahead. The crowd made me dizzy. Let's step aside. Are you coming to the procession? Like we used to, remember? You were a nuisance. You asked so many questions. "Which saint had wings?" "Who got a sword lodged in his head?" The church bells are tolling. The bands are playing. The crowds are celebrating. Breathe in the air, Bitoy! It's the smell of celebration. The scent of Intramuros. Of our beloved Manila. Candida? Our last October in this house All of this will fade away Farewell to each memory Of our old life Which was lost and disappeared The world has changed its course To save one's life One must die Farewell to each memory Of our old life Which was lost and disappeared Can we bring back Those happy days? We need to move your father and his portrait someplace safer. Candida, where is the portrait? I do not know. Did you sell it? No. Was it stolen? No. Where is it then? I told you, I do not know. What did you do with it? - Paula put it away. - Where did she put it? She did not tell me. - How could you... - Stop asking me. I know nothing. Hello, is anyone there? Whoever it is, I am not home. Hello... - What do you want? - We want to see Tony - Is he sick? - He hasn't been to the theater in two days -He'll get fired -He needs to know Where is he? I don't know He hasn't been home for the last two days - Did he take his clothes? - All of his things are still here - Are you two his friends? - Yes I packed up all of his clothes Take them to him Didn't he pay his rent? Tell him to never show his face here again Where is Paula? On her way home from church. Please, have a seat. - Then nothing's happened to her. - What do you mean? What have you heard? That Paula eloped. That she's been kidnapped. That is definitely not true. Thank God! If that's the case, we'll be on our way. We are hosting a dance tonight For the American servicemen Charlie will dance the rhumba Elsa will dance the conga Hello, anyone there? Bitoy, please see who that is. On second thought, we'll stay for awhile. I am exhausted from running around. We want to speak to Miss Marasigan. I am Miss Marasigan. Miss Marasigan. The day before yesterday You called us to report That your sister had been kidnapped Sometime around noon We have not located your sister yet But we found the man who... That was all a mistake My sister was not missing Why didn't you call us To withdraw your complaint? I am sorry You see my black eye? Next time, think carefully Before filing a complaint May we use your telephone? We don't have a phone. Go make the call Tell them to release the man I arrested Who's the guy, chief? The man she said Had kidnapped Miss Paula Marasigan - Is his name Tony Javier? - Yes, Tony Javier Where did you find him? He was in a bar Destroying all the furniture Drunk! But they will release him now, right? After he pays his fine You and your sister are really something! Miss Marasigan, what exactly happened? Nothing happened. My sister simply went for a drive And forgot to tell me This happened around noon The day before yesterday? And she came back right away Officer, since there are no charges I see no point In continuing these questions No way! We want all of this out in the open They started the trouble They should pay for it Poor Candida! Poor Paula! They put poor Tony in jail And he lost his job Now, you want to hide Your family's dirty laundry I'll gossip about it all over town I'll spread all your sordid secrets Everyone will know About your sister's little escapades She did not Come back immediately, did she? She did not come back right away I lied about that Paula came home At 3:00 a.m. in the morning Candida! I was waiting for her right here I was going to chastise her And as she was slowly coming up the stairs She just stood there Not saying anything And her face... Her face... How can I ever forget her face? Stop it, Candida! How can I ever forget her face? Stop it, I tell you! I knew I was the one to blame I was all my fault I've destroyed Paula's life Take her to her room. Come with me. Wait! You want to know where she was? Where she went? What she did? - Candida, please... - I'm the one to blame I betrayed my sister I'm the one who pushed her to go I'm the one Who wanted what happened to happen And do you know why? Because of $10,000 dollars! I thought about my future I can no longer bear being poor I am tired of haggling in the market Of hiding from bill collectors Of losing electricity and water And all for what? For 20,000 pesos! I've destroyed my sister I've brought her unforgivable shame Now, you all know. Please excuse me. I do not feel well. Find her, Bitoy. She's probably still in church. Tell her to come home. I can face her now. Tell her that we are one again Partners Sisters once more Where is Paula? She is not here. Where is the portrait? Where is it? - I do not know. - I said, where is the portrait? Leave me alone. Go away! I'll leave. Don't worry. But not without the portrait. I will never give it to you. You've changed your tone. - You're willing to sell it. - You are right. You were willing to sell your sister. You are right. You didn't care how I did it, as long as she agreed to sell as well. And did she agree? Of course! All I know is she came back alone. She left you. There's no turning back. I have you in my grasp. But I won't double-cross you. You'll get your 20,000 pesos. I just want my commission. Your commission? What else? I'm sorry, Tony You will not get your commission Paula! Paula, why did you leave me? You will never forgive me For what I did to you Paula, don't hate me. I admit I had bad intentions. But now... Please, try to understand me. I want to make things right between us. Is that true? Please believe me. I believe you Where is the portrait then? That is our salvation. We'll start a new life. I promise I will change. You will be free. Free? Don't tease me. Do you love me? Tell me the truth. I will learn to love you. We just need to leave this house. Where is the portrait? The American is waiting. The portrait is gone. What did you do? I destroyed it! What? What did you do? I destroyed our painting, Candida. I slashed it and set it on fire. Are you angry? No. Are you crying? I think that's Tony Javier. He has found his tears. He has learned to cry. Why did you do it? I do not want to run away like you. You denied me my only chance to improve my life. How could you do that? Why did you deceive me? I could have made you happy. I would have set you free. I am free now I am free once more I burned that cursed portrait And now I am home I am free of my ghosts I am free of my fears The demon that tormented me No longer possesses me I am soaring now High up in the clouds In my place up in the heavens I can fly once again I can fly Once again Our victim. Our offering. I merely wielded the knife. You laid the wood upon the altar. You lit the flame. Paula Please, forgive me Do you have any regrets? About the portrait? What would you have done if you were me? I would have done exactly what you did Candida, do you know what we are facing? Night and day without electricity Bill collectors hounding us Being subjects of endless gossip They will say we have lost our senses Imagine, we just let go of $10,000 dollars They will say we are a pair of lunatics They will say that we are dangerous I do not care what they say We will just go on catching rats We will speak in our language of Babylon Are you not afraid? In our world of Babylon? To be swept aside like rats May God forgive me Forever wanting To be just like everyone else Then stand and be proud We are free once again You, me and Father He was testing us By giving us the portrait This is the proof That we are keeping our faith That we have not abandoned our ideals That we are the true heirs Of Don Lorenzo the Magnificent Turn on the lights! You're here! - And we're here too! - Here we are! - Don Alvaro. Donya Upeng. - How is your father? He is doing well Candida Brandy for Don Alvaro Brandy for Donya Upeng Brandy for Bitoy Is this Bitoy Camacho? Yes, I am here for the feast of La Naval It is good that you honor An old tradition before it disappears Disappears? If war breaks out That is why we are here tonight To salute the Virgin From your balcony like in the old days Candida, Paula Tonight could be the last time Perhaps Where have you been, you old ox? Come join us. Why, is something wrong, child? We need your help That is why we are here Here come the reinforcements Your being here is already a big help Aristeo! My God, we are all here! Welcome to our house, noble soldier I dragged my aching bones up here To salute La Naval Wait, Aristeo Paula and Candida's lives Are being threatened Threatened? I should have brought my pistol! Brandy for our protector Child, why are your hands cold? Are you truly in danger? We are being driven out of our house We must stand our ground And we will stand with you You must remain in this house To continue To preserve The symbol That our way of life goes on You are right Let us toast To the Virgin of La Naval Long live the Virgin! So many people. - Hey, Bitoy! - How are you? Pepang, Manolo. Have you come to honor La Naval? You know why we are here Have you come to confess? Confess what? Come clean, Pepang, Manolo You will feel great relief You will be free Just look at yourselves You are causing a scandal! Shameful! Gather your clothes You are leaving with us right now Tell them to leave Wow! Is that Manolito? I hardly recognized you You have grown, my child Don Aristeo, I am sorry But I must ask you to leave This is strictly a family matter - And is this Little Pepang? - Little Pepang? You were so pretty when you were younger. And Little Pepang I will never forget how you recited Jose Rizal's, "The Last Farewell" When you were hardly seven It was I who taught it to her And it was I Who taught you to dance, Manolo In this very room when you were 15 Manolo and Pepang Must really love This house they grew up in They do not They do not love this house? They want to sell it Sell it? How horrible! But why? They refuse to admit it Because of the expense? Money is not the problem Although that is the reason they give They throw away money It's bad. On mah-jongg and the race tracks But they deceive themselves Candida! Paula! This house taunts them It spoils all their fun -When they are gossiping -Or gambling Or at the races or at the jai alai Or when they cannot sleep They are crushed By the shadow of the house Of Lorenzo the Magnificent Their hands tremble Their blood turns cold You mean they are afraid Of this house? They are petrified But why? Because this house is their conscience Yes, Manolo! Yes, Pepang! This is your conscience That is why you despise it You want to tear it apart You want to destroy it To stop your conscience From tormenting you Shut up! Shut up! Be quiet now The Virgin approaches The Virgin has come to save us Candida, Paula, come with me! My patience has run out. No, Manolo Nobody can leave now The streets are closed The procession has begun They will leave now Even if I have to throw them Down the stairs! Then you will have To throw me down the stairs as well! - And me! - And me! And us! How about our father, Manolo? Are you going to throw him Down the stairs as well? Father loathes you! He is on our side And here he is Father! Manolo, it's Father! It took a world war to destroy the spirit of the three who lived here. Farewell, Candida. Farewell, Paula. Though your story may have been lost to history, we are here to celebrate your lives with this song. Farewell, Candida Farewell, Paula Though your story May have been lost to history We are here to celebrate your lives with this song
