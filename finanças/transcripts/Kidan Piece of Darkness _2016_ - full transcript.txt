OVERTAKING I was scared witless! But who screamed first? Not me. I heard a scream behind me. -So it was you! -No! I just got scared when everyone screamed. They'd gone on midnight drives ever since Mr. U got his license. That operating room was scary. Yeah, syringes and stuff. They checked out places which were said to be haunted. Ghost-hunting at crossings, passes, abandoned buildings. That room at the far end... It must've been the morgue. You felt something strange. And I got a headache. But they'd never encountered anything really weird. I didn't want to say this before, but... I felt a presence in that room. No way! Really? I was following you guys out of the room when... I felt someone watching me. And then... someone walked through the room. You saw them? No. There was nobody there when I turned around. But it felt like there was. No way! It was a man, right? Middle-aged? Yeah, I guess so. That's freaky! It's so scary! Even the slightest hint of something would get them hyped up as if it were real, but they never truly believed that they'd seen anything supernatural. Hey, that's it. There it is! Yeah! Get ready. We're going in. You see, the four of them all love ghost stories. I can feel a chill in the air. Yeah! What happens here? Various things. White hands fly towards the car, and then a head comes flying, too! That's so scary! Let's stop the car. Yeah, let's walk. No way! I'm scared. It's illegal to park in a tunnel. There are no other cars. No, we could cause a crash. In fact, there was nothing. But to admit that would be boring. I didn't want to say this before, but... What? I thought I saw a face in a stain on the tunnel wall. No way! It was a man, right? Middle-aged? Yeah, I guess so. That's so scary! They all knew there was nothing really there. They just acted like there was. That night was the same until Mr. U said... What's that? Look! Yeah! What's she doing? Taking a walk? You're joking. At this time, out here? She's got the trademark long hair. She's a ghost! For real! I'm scared. It did seem very strange. Three in the morning. No houses around. The middle of nowhere. Come on, let's just go. Okay. According to tradition, if you tell 100 ghost stories in a single night, a real ghost will appear. Here I present to you some ghost stories sent to me by the readers of my mystery novels. KIDAN PIECE OF DARKNESS A letter from a reader: Mom! One day, Ms. K was suddenly called to work on an urgent matter. It's no problem. Hey! Don't throw your shoes around! -Thanks. -Bye. Hey! Ms. K had two young children. Be careful! She asked her mother, who lived nearby, to look after them. I told you! Kazu, Shota! Stop it! Is it tasty? Not too hot? Eat your veggies, too. After Ms. K's mother had fed the children, she put them to bed to have a siesta. And apparently, she fell asleep as well, along with them. SHADOW MAN But then... a noise woke her up. Hi, Mom. I've finished work. What should I buy for dinner? Oh, right. Yeah. What shall we have? No way! You must've bumped it. While I was asleep? No doubt. The pain must've made you have a nightmare. Do I toss and turn that much? It happened to Shota, too. He was writhing around so much, he fell out of bed. I was so surprised! When I asked him if he was okay, he said he'd had a dream where he fell off a slide! It was so funny. The same as you. I bumped my own nose? I shouldn't laugh at Shota. That's right! Want some more coffee? Maybe you shouldn't. It'll start bleeding. Mom. Is that... When their eyes met, they heard the sound. It was as if someone was angry, or they were trying to break the glass door. A violent sound. Ms. K and her mother were too scared to go and check. They never found out who or what that man was. Was he a real person? Or was he just an apparition? The shadow man never appeared to Ms. K and her mother... ever again. A letter from a reader: -See you tomorrow. -Bye. Don't forget your club stuff for tomorrow. Ms. S was a high school student. One day, coming home from her after-school club, she was passing by a park in her neighborhood. When she... happened to glance into the park, she saw a man standing there without an umbrella. Excuse me. There's a weird guy. Over there. Stay here. Hey! What are you doing? He hung himself! I'll call the police. You run on home. Go on! Mom! Mom! That was three years ago. Ms. S now lives in Tokyo and goes to college. Even now, Ms. S gets scared when she sees a man in work clothes in the dark. But then she realizes it was just a coincidence and calms down. But she also says this. "But sometimes, there's a man who just stands there. Without moving. Just standing there. I wonder... who or what he is." TAILED A letter from a reader: S heard this story from their homeroom teacher. Hey there. Sorry, sir! Be more careful! Pick them up. Are you okay? All right. Sorry! Here you are. -Thanks. -Bye. -Take care on your way home. -Okay! It happened to a senior colleague of the homeroom teacher. Hello. Wait, I... LOOKING TOGETHER Around one hour later... -Vice-principal. -Upstairs! What's up? The clerk... Help me lift her. Ready, lift! Help us! The scissors! Cut her down! Quick! Are you okay? Lie her down! Let's lie her down. Move the table! Quick! Here goes, watch it. Are you okay? Are you okay? Too late. Must be rigor mortis. I'll call an ambulance. Don't go in there! What happened? Stay outside! Please stay here. What happened? Is she alive? -I'll get something to cover her. -Wait! Don't look at me! She had tear-stains on her face. Vice-principal? Sorry! Leave me alone, you wench! Stop it. What is this? We just slept together once. You made the approach. She kept her hand on his shoulder until the other teachers came back, looking out of the window together with him. Sorry to keep you. Stop it! Are you okay? Err... Yeah. Could you give me a hand? Sure. Hello. A letter from a reader: Here. Let's go. -What the heck? -Let's go! That's creepy! It can't be true. No, it's true. It happened at my old school. One day, Ms. A joined Ms. N's class as a transfer student. A few weeks later, a classmate invited them to her house. The sound of her footsteps is scary. Clack, clack, clack. But what is "the woman in red"? I don't know, but she looked human. It makes me shiver! Let's tell everyone the story. Okay. Stop it, I tell you! You told the story. Why are you so scared? Because... when you tell the story, she gets angry and appears. I see. It's a dangerous story. Just kidding! -Got you! -I'll get you! Don't get me! Don't do that to me! THE WOMAN IN RED -This is the front door? -Yes. Where are they? Happy birthday! Me? How did you know? I saw your ID. Sorry! It's fine. Thank you! Come on. My mom's away until tomorrow, so we're doing it here. -This is amazing! -Right? -Let's be friends. -You seem nice. Really? Thanks. Let's have some fun! Happy birthday! Yeah! They won't go out! Help me. You can blow hard! -Happy birthday! -Thank you! It's delicious. They do lunch as well. Let's go together. It really is delicious! It was kind of inane, but they enjoyed themselves. Until the evening. Why don't you tell that story? The scary story I told you. A scary story? Why not? It's dark now. Great! Do we have to? Don't worry. -I'll turn out the light. -That one. And so, Ms. N began to tell the tale of the woman in red. And then, she heard a sound. Clack. Clack. Clack. Footsteps. Clack. Clack. Clack. When she turned round, there was the woman in red! What? Aren't you scared? I'm scared enough! I'm no good at telling stories. Yes you are. It was scary. And then, when you tell the story... When you tell the story, the woman in red gets angry... and appears! I see. You aren't scared? Stop it, I tell you! Must be my mom. Wait. What shall we do? Hold on. It must be my mom. Wait. There's nobody here! We just imagined it. What happened? There was someone there! -Nobody. -You imagined it. I saw her. I saw her! It's true. Isn't it? What is? When you tell the story, the woman in red appears. What? You really believe it? -It's your fault! -It's just a story. Don't get so scared. There's no such thing as ghosts! It wasn't a ghost. She was really there. Don't take it seriously! But it really happened! You imagined it. Don't worry. Calm down. I told you not to tell it! I saw her. For real! -Calm down. -Everyone. Please go home. Are you okay? Sorry, I shouldn't have said anything. You don't believe it, do you? I'm fine. It's late. You'll be scared walking home. I guess so. And so, they each made their way home. We'll be fine. As long as you tell the story to someone, you're safe. So... we'll be okay. She goes after those who hear the story. And then... the one who told it is safe. Those who hear the story? That's why everyone tried to make people hear the story. In the end, nobody listened to me anymore. Even the teachers. That's why you transferred? Why didn't you say that? I reckon the story will spread around this school too. After that, the woman in red was spotted several times. But nobody found out who she really was. Let me go! Why? Why? Why me? A letter from a reader: Mr. T was a high school student. One night, his friend, Mr. Y, tried to tune in the radio to hear the education channel. However... EMPTY CHANNEL I'd like to tell you... So I was really angry. -Wow! -You know why? She pretended to be my friend, but behind my back, she was seeing a guy I really liked! That just isn't right! If she was a true friend, she wouldn't keep him all to herself. Friends are supposed to share! She's more like an enemy than... It's gone. I'll never forgive her. Yeah! Sounds great! -Skirt's too short! -Buzz off, four-eyes! Like, it's an empty channel. There's a woman's voice at the same time every night. She grumbles about stuff that's happened to her. It's like shouting "The king has donkey's ears!" down a well. Like in that fable. She says what she does with guys in hotels. Explicit stuff. What could it be? Maybe a bugging device? I shouldn't listen? Eavesdropping isn't very nice. The roof is out of bounds! Get out! See you later. So I shouldn't listen? It's always me who has to call him. And he always breaks promises. I wish he'd just die! I wrapped up a present for him and he didn't even open it! What was inside? Want to know what it was? Well, that's obvious! His baby, of course! His child! I know. Where do you think you're going? I haven't finished! I'm just kidding, of course. -Hi. -Hi. Nao's really cute. But she has a dirty mouth. I don't mind that. You like her? Nao! I'll go on ahead. Hey. Are you still listening to it? Yeah. But it's getting nasty. That woman's messed up. Maybe dangerous. You shouldn't listen to... But I can't help it. He's a bit weird. When I passed by him, I heard a strange voice. -A voice? -Yeah. It was like a baby crying. I'm joking! I must've imagined it. Let's go. Come on. Come on. Come on! Come on. Come on! Come on.... Yeah! I'd like to tell you something. In homeroom the next day, they heard that Mr. Y had died. He had strangled himself in his own room. No suicide note. Nobody ever found out why he did it. A letter from a reader: This happened at I's high school. One evening, two teachers were working late. You're still working? WHOSE KID? Hopefully I'll be finished soon. You shouldn't stay here too late. Especially alone. Why not? You're new here so you don't know, but there are various things. -Various? -Yeah. Schools are like that. Understand? Bye. Just a moment. I'm going for a smoke. What are you implying? By what? "Various things." Well, a long time ago... A student? At this time? What is this? Who's there? Nobody. This kind of thing. Hey. What is it? Hey, wait! See you! What was that? Tell me. Please wait. I'm going to leave, too! It's fine. I must've imagined it. What's he doing? Why's he going? I asked him to wait! What's he trying to say? "Various things." "See you!" Dummy! That's it. He's just a dumb... You. Who are you? Whose kid? Are you with someone? I see. That noise. It was you! Stop that! Hey! Stop! What was that dance? Ballet? You making fun of me? Oh, no! I forgot to post that stuff. I hope that dolt's still there. Hello. Sorry, but could you post the... Hello? Hello? Hello? Excellent! Hey, you little twerp! I told you to stop! Give me a break! That door's locked. No more hide-and-seek! What are you doing? Say something! I'm sorry! Forgive me! Who or what the little girl is, and when she first appeared remains a mystery. But people say she's been there a long time. And for some reason the only ones to encounter her are teachers, apparently. Hey. Hey. Hey. What happened to you? The letters, the post... What are you talking about? Oh. Just now, in the car... Hey! A letter from a reader: When Mr. N was in grade school, something weird happened. LET'S CARRY ON Let's play in the graveyard. Okay. They never usually played in the graveyard, but that day, they decided to for some reason. We're going to get cursed! -Cursed! -Help me, O ancestors! We'll get cursed! We'll get cursed! We'll get cursed! Are you okay? I'm going home. He got cursed! Creepy! Spooky! We'll get cursed! -What happened? -What's up? What's the matter? Ready, lift! -That's nasty! -Gross! I've had enough. I'm going home. We might all get cursed! Yeah! Let's carry on. I can go home, right? Let's carry on. I'm going home. Ow! I cut my hand. Look, it's bleeding. Yeah. I'm going home. For some reason, Mr. N couldn't say "Come with me." And Mr. K didn't say "I'll go with you." Let's carry on. Let's carry on. Let's carry on. Let's carry on. Who was last? Nobody asked Mr. K anything. Mr. K didn't say anything. Mr. K didn't talk to anyone... for a long time after that. A letter from a reader: When Ms. T was in high school, a spiteful rumor spread around her neighborhood. Apparently, a certain woman with lots of children was a bit odd. -Hello. -Hello. Say "Here's the circular." -Here's the circular. -Thanks. You're pregnant? No, just fat. I see. THIEF You ate it!? Hey! -Mom, have you seen her? -I have. But when I asked her, she said she was just fat. Just fat? People only get fat like that when they're pregnant. That's right. Only her belly is big. Ms. T hated the way they gossiped. You know, why keep it a secret? It just isn't neighborly. As if she can't trust us! After a while, the rumors got even nastier. Washy-washy! Splashy-splashy! Water everywhere! On mine, too! -On everyone's. -Yeah. This is good. Here. This is good, yeah. She's suddenly slim. It's weird. No diet works that fast. Has she given birth? I haven't seen any baby. There's a reason why she tried to hide it. Like what? She said she can't afford to have any more kids. Poor thing. Scary, isn't it? Sis! Where are you from? Here. Maa fell into the drain. The drain? The drain. You're talking about this drain? Yeah. You fell in? I was dropped. By who? A thief. A thief? Have you been robbed? The thief dropped me in there. Opened the grate and threw me in. The water came whooshing along and I was washed away. Someone got you out? No, I got washed away and died. -But you're alive! -I'm alive, but I died. When was that? A bit before. Why didn't you cry for help? I did. I bawled, but it was no good. You bawled? Poor baby. Who was dropped into the drain? You or a baby? Hold on. It's inside out! You're so silly! Hello. How are you today? I'm fine. Where did you come from? See you. Bye. Hello. Here. Thank you. Your belly was big. What happened? I had a problem with my ovaries. I took some medicine and my belly went flat. How is Maa? Huh? Maa. He's fine. Ms. T doesn't believe rumors. But ever since then, she's been scared of drains. A letter from a reader: Yeah. When are you picking up your stuff? Why should I have to send it? I don't even want to touch your things. Pick it up or I'll throw it out next week. I'm giving you a week. You should be grateful. Just tell me when you're coming. Ms. K began to get a strange feeling about the closet, apparently. SEALED Yeah. Next month? I'll throw it out tomorrow. Pick it up, then! I'm not going to send it. Saying sorry now means nothing to me. No, you don't get it. Look, I don't care who you had an affair with and who you didn't. What about your stuff? Day after tomorrow? Yeah, you'd better. Yeah. Actually, can you pick it up tomorrow morning? It's bulky trash day. You can throw out anything. And that dirty suitcase you found. Take that too. I remember this. Right, right. The suitcase. I could put my stuff in it. Right? I'm so smart! Oh, yeah! I never could get it open. Will it open? Just a minute. Here. I found these, too. It won't open. Help! Ms. K's ex-boyfriend never picked up the suitcase, so she threw it out, apparently. Go to hell.
