Subtitles by Nostromo ALEXANDRIA 19 DECEMBER 1941 The two battleships '' Queen Elizabeth '' and "Valiant" were sunk in Alexandria harbour by six men, of the Italian 10th flotilla.. They came from a submarine,but the underwater weapons they used were new Human torpedoes, chariots. Each was ridden by two divers,and each carried an explosive warhead Which were detached from the valves and slung by wires under the hull of the target ship Those chariots have altered the naval balance of power in the Mediterranean. They may yet alter the course of this war Already they have chosen their next target Ourselves Gibraltar, gentlemen. The gateway Whether we like it or not, we are the gateway to the Mediterranean. If the enemy shuts us down, Malta is isolated so is Alexandria The 8th army loses its supply route we lose North Africa. So we got to keep open,simple as that In war, most gateways have a lock on them.. A lock called security We haven't. That's the difference. Let me show you. Look at there in Algeciras,gentlemen, someone is watching us. We call him the duty spy He sits there 4 miles across the bay, in neutral country of Spain. and he watches everything what's happening on this rock. He is watching us at this window he watches your ships as they enter and leave the bay. -Any questions? -But how,Sir,where from? The enemy has consulates in Algeciras Luckily so have we You mean there are agents over there tell the subs when the convoy arrives and their boys attack it here? -Exactly The sooner we are on our way to Malta, the better. Algeciras is not their only source of information you see that airstrip down there Just beyond is the Spanish frontier Every morning thousands of men come down that road across the border to work in the dockyard here Every evening they go back again into Spain We do everything we can to screen them,it is a pretty hopeless task Thank heavens we are only here for a few nights Now,gentlemen,now at least you know the picture You are anchored up here. Here's the submarine net. We shall do everything we can to protect you, but ... but it is essential you all have a sharp look out to be kept all night Any question? ... Right! Let's get into the details. Something about Gibraltar we do get regular air mail from home We also get the occasionally bright boy from London to tell us how to run a war.It's probably a White Hall warrior on this one Crabb! Crabb ! Wake up! -Lt.Crabb,we are here -What is it? Where's ..oh? -Oh,I wish you wouldn't do that,Mr Hopend -We are over the rock. -What rock? -Gibraltar,of course. As a rule we forget that we're excited about the first view of Gib I am an exception besides I am tired. -I can not imagine why? -You have been asleep nearly all the way. You couldn't imaging the party last I had last night either -You got a family,Mr Hopend? -Yes. You're lucky.And keep your farewells for them I am a lonely man so crowds of people turned up to see me off Never met most of them before and probably will never see them again. That's Gibraltar,eh? -Who are those ships out there in the bay? -They are a convoy at anchor And that's where the ? get mined stuck in a hole,is (?)? Careless talk Ever managed to blow up anything inside the harbour? They've tried but we have the situation under control. -Divers and that -On the ships? How many divers? Landing in 2 minutes. Hang on,tie everyone When we're out of the airstrip we are going to drink. I know the rock very well I can give you any tips ... You can give one now.Where do I find the Admiral? At the naval headquarters. He is a very busy man but I'm sure he will put everything on one side to welcome R.N.V.R. Lieutenant Mr Hofend, I just bought myself a brand new uniform for the first time since the war started and I propose to creased it properly by visiting that admiral. And now then how many divers did you say? -Two. -He'll see me. Come in! -Have you an appointment, sir? -No. Sorry Sir,no one allowed in the Admiral's office without first seeing the Assistant secretary 3rd Officer Wren Masters,Sir. This is her office,Sir - Well,where is she - Inside with the Admiral,Sir Look,If I have to see her before,I can go in, and she is already inside how the devil do I get in? It is a problem,Sir,isn't it? Of course you could wait until she comes out,Sir I see,could you tell me how Even if she does comes out,Sir, I doubt she let you go in -Not unless you have an appointment,Sir -Oh she won't,won't she? You listen to me,I came out to this blasted rock of yours to get on with the war. And if you think, a whole army of wrens pannies,ats,waps,can stop me for getting in you are very much mistaken That's a nasty cough! Are you 3rd Officer Wren Masters? -I am -I want to see the admiral. -Name -Crabb -Christian name? -Lionel Philip Kenneth. Rank I am a Lance Corporal in the Chinese army. Lieutenant R.N.V.R.,ID card? Thank you. Why do you want to see the admiral? I arrived in Gibraltar an hour ago. I'm a bomb and mine disposal officer and I can't dispose of anything until I find it. Bomb and mine disposal. Oh yes. We had a signal about you - Incredible,can I go in now? -I'm afraid not. It is quite impossible. -Who says so? -I do,Lieutenant Quite alone,without the assistance of any Fannies,Ats,Swats or even another Wren I'll wait. Won't do you any good. He's far too busy Why don't you go for a walk? Miss Masters,I have not been sent to Gibraltar to go for walks now will you please tell the Admiral ...Sir... See what I mean? How do I get to that breakwater down there? Well,now being a Flag Lt with an admiral star,I suppose you walk,old boy Which way? Well,there are at the end of the dockyard and out on the mole Extraordinary fellow -Shut up! Enjoy your dip,Sir? - Lovely.Boiling hot Diver's Rum ration Best of luck Aren't you doing all right,Rattler? If it is not, you can kiss me good bye on the bottom Come on Are you in in charge of this diving party? Well,actually,Old Boy, I am a Torpedo Officer,mine sweeping flotilla but I like swimming so I thought I lend a hand -Name's Bailey,how do you do -Crabb. Bomb and Mine disposal There are no bombs.I'm afraid,old boy We never get an air raid Peaceful little place,really Do you think we can find any mines for this officer to dispose of,Knowles? Delighted,Sir,provided they don't dispose of us first. -BTW this Leading Seaman Knowles -How do you do,Knowles. And over there Able Seaman Morgan about to dive with a destiny in the deep Total strength diving party in Gibraltar: 2 -What about you? -Just done my farewell performance,old boy -Got to sail back home and beauty tomorrow. -We'll manage on our own,Sir Have you ever managed to examine one of these mines? Oh,yes,old boy They stick them on the holes with sort of inner tube pair We swim out at the night cut the tubes and mine sinks Unless it's magnetic Then, we just pull Of course,some of them blast without us finding them at all Not surprising really Even more surprising they don't blast when you do find them Have you've ever managed to take one of the fuses to bits? Give us a chance,old boy, three chaps in the whole ruddy bay to clean up We haven't got time to turn the beastly things ashore and dissect them in a workshop Come to that,we haven't even got a workshop Do you mind if I have a go? -What dive? -Yes,it looks fairly simple to me -Ever done it before? -No but I can swim -What do you think,Knowles? -Well,Sir, the ball got to start sometime Since you're going back to UK All right Knowles you show him the drill I am late for lunch Best of luck old boy Just go down go down the ladder a few feet old boy and then come up again.It's a piece of cake See that you can breathe all right And Knowles you better tie a rope around him in case he can't Bye Here now,lighter this is your oxygen bottle,normally you just breath in air through this back(?) If you start feeling short of breath tuck your bottle like this get yourself extra whiff of oxygen,right? I see Now naturally you are breathing through the mouth,so mug this in,Sir Tight firmly Slowly. That's it. And now the goggles,Sir Pull them down nice and firmly Give yourself a good seal That's it It's a pity Mr Bailey has to go, he has done a fine job So maybe you can replace him Nice to have one officer around with the outfit Makes it seems more respectable One last thing,nose clip on You must have that on otherwise you might breath in half the ruddy ocean Thank you very much Let's get the rope around you,Sir No,I'm sorry to do this to you,Sir but we can't risk losing you not the first day we found you Now just remember,breathe naturally, and I'll get four tugs on the rope when it's time to come up,right? Up we go,then Sir Now you'll find Morgan down there,Sir, he is only doing a practice himself Did you say your name was Crabb,Sir? There never was a much better one for this job,really Name Leading Seaman Knowles,Sir, Naval Diving Party,Sir -What are you doing? -Pulling on the rope, sir. I can see that. What have you got in the end of it? Crabb,Sir,officer,Sir -Is he a diver? -No,Sir What the devil are you trying to do,drown him? No Sir,get him up,Sir I think he's coming now,Sir Miss Masters about turn Oh,it's alright,Sir,he's got his pants on,sorry,Sir About turn Miss Masters What did you get me up for,Knowles, I never enjoyed so much in my life You got a new diving officer,my lad, Just wait until I get my clothes on I'll get to see that admiral,if I have to take that female dragon and stick her upside down over one of her own filing cabinets Do you know these blasted goggles is full of water I can't see a damn The officer I was telling you about,Sir, Lt. Crabb He arrived today from England,to take up a bomb and mine disposal duty Lt.Crabb,you should know by now you would not salute unless you're wearing a cap Yes,Sir The same apply to trousers put them on Yes,Sir So you want to take over the diving party and find the mine yourselves,eh? Yes I think it is important which types they are and we can't do.. Yes I know all that I shouldn't be wasting my time talking to you Do you consider you medically and psychologically suited to underwater work? -Yes,Sir -Why? Well as a proper qualified diver I think Leading Seaman Knowles could best give you the technical details,Sir I don't want the technical details I want an answer -Well -Well,Sir You saw his face,when he came out of the water -Always tell a man,Sir -Right,you got the job Report to my chief of staff you will be briefed with everything you want to know -Any questions? -More men in a diving boat,Sir I shall like more men in the cockpit,Sir Yes,so should I When you find the mine come and see me Make an appointment with Miss Masters first,of course Would be a pleasure,Sir -And Crabb -Sir? It's important job. Don't make a muck of it Sir You ought to be wearing weighted shoes,you know,Sir In the last time,he doesn't wear them. All right stop looking so fidgety, get me a pair of shoes Only get started on the next one You'll have a rest in between,Sir we have another 18 ships to clear,you know We have a rest,when it is dark I'll believe that when it happens Lt.Crabb Lt.Crabb You'll have your job,Sir Look out It's a new type of mine,Sir, never seen something like it before This (??) Search lights on.We'll be there in a couple of minutes. You all right? Yes I don't feel tired when I'm diving seems to catch me when I come up I know,Sir I'm sorry I shouted at you this afternoon That's all right,Sir,all of us have to go off steam sometimes. I'd have to go -What does this mine look like? -There is a torpedo shape. It's got a propeller attached to the whole by two metal clamps There's it will be now,Sir Morgan's waiting alongside with a diving hood Sounds exciting this, we used to spend all the night cruising up and down,dropping depth charges and thinking again of one of those underwater bastards If we get that mine off,that's what the Italians will be calling us Come on, Knowles. Good luck. If you find the diver, drown him. -I'll go with you,Sir -I'll let you know if I need any help Crew off the ship,all except the Skipper,Sir -What was he last port of call,Capt... -Lisbon.Started engine trouble -Going down now? -Yes Better watch up.Those traps maybe booby-traps If they are you know as soon as I do When it's clear I'll secure the rope and you pull it in Right,Sir It's a nasty looking thing,Rattler Pretty horrible Have a cigarette. Divers shouldn't smoke, you know. Shouldn't dive either Don't you think those clamps got booby-traps on it? Blasted swell I'm going in Take it easy It is very rough,you got a baby torpedo on the other end of that(?) Broke made fast? We'd like to take it on shore We got to take to bits -Where? -We'll find somewhere,got a cigarette? All right down there? Did you find it? A beauty Capt.. just give us 10 minutes to get clear and you can take your crew aboard Thanks very much.It's a pity we couldn't our cargo to Malta What are you carrying? -Food -No,high explosive Good night Take it easy. Wait for that next breaker. Right,pull -Here's Morgan Knowles too -About time too I brought the tools and a field telephone,Sir What,that in that pick-nick basket? The tools are underneath,Sir.I thought we'd earned some breakfast as well. Remind me to have you made a Petty Officer I think it's caught in the sand,Sir Right,stay here,I'll get it. Lovely place to bring a mine ashore Beautiful sand surrounded by barbed wire and a minefield How are we going to get it through that barbs? Gave up asking question three hours ago Look at the man,he's like a mother with her baby It didn't blow up in his face until he start singing to it Keep away from it Is this you have to take it through the wire,Sir? How many men(?) I not understand Perhaps you like to take it to the dockyard over there in Spain I can't think of anywhere else I thought you've given up asking questions I hear my Commander whatever I've got to do More bombs and (?) sooner I get them for you -Say you don't want? -I don't say I don't want them.. I merely said I can't stock them here in this airfield -Why not? -Because there isn't any room Look,everywhere on the runaway,we are jammed tight with aircraft They are all full of fuel. I can't risk their safety by lying high explosive anyone near them -Smead? -Yeah Let them??? will you? Able,Sir I'm very sorry.I hope you can perhaps find somewhere else It is not even possible Good grace,Crabb,what on earth are you doing? Good morning,Holford. We are just enjoying a bit of breakfast -Here,have a banana -Thank you very much You know you're in the wrong uniform, summery one started this morning And what devil do you think you are doing on my airstrip? We been carrying out a sweep of mine in your sea,Sir Can't risk any of them drifting ashore damaging one of your aircraft,can we,Sir? Why no,of course Well,good show,thanks very much.Press on Come along.Holford. Very co-operative to know these naval chaps They realize the situation we are into the best of help Now I'm going to remove the clock first and then the detonators Get the phone over there and write down everything I tell you -Aye,aye,Sir -Good luck,Sir-Go on get on with it Removing last screw now He can't get it further away,if it blows up we have to bury ourselves in Spain Shut up. Starting to withdraw 3rd and last detonator carriage Now And for heavens sake keep quiet,if I jog this one we'd had it Mr Crabb, the Admiral send me to ... It's quite safe now. The admiral send me to find you He wants you to have lunch with him at his house Then I'd better go and change into the right uniform,haven't I? I see but now tell me how the timing mechanism works You cannot be too technical Well,Sir,the mine has 3 detonators and 2 clocks The clocks were set to fire at 48 hours after leaving port But they weren't the important part of the job That was the propeller and it works like this You see,Sir,irrespective of the clocks the propeller will turn as the ship went through the water And after a certain number of revolutions will explode the detonators So the ship will blow up at sea and we've been shipping torpedo Very ingenious But if the mine was planted in Lisbon why didn't it explode before the "Willowdale" got to Gib I don't think it was,Sir She only went into Lisbon at the last moment because of engine trouble It would have been impossible for an enemy agent to have done the the job from there You mean it was done here and she would have been blown up on her way to Malta? Yes,Sir But the Admiral already told us There has been no submarine activity over the last week Go ahead,Crabb,say what you think Well,Sir,you are the British consul in Algeciras. Yes All right, George.You may as well tell him our suspicions. He's guessed them anyway Does the name Tomolino mean anything to you? -Antonio Tomolino? -Yes. I should say was the best marine engineer and designer in Italy One of the greatest experts in the underwater warfare in the world As far as we know,he usually works for the 10th Flotilla You are remarkably well informed ,Crabb But you may not know that he got married a year ago His wife's name is Conchita and she apparently needs sea air. He took a villa for her and built a large window into one of the walls. The villa is in Algeciras and the window faces straight towards Gibraltar. They've been there ten months. That's a pretty long honeymoon even for an Italian If the 10th flotilla is operating from the Algeciras. They must be relying on frogmen diving from some lonely part of the coast They can't be using chariots because they need a base and workshops for maintenance -I presume you've noticed those,Sir -Naturally So would the Spanish authorities.We don't even know if there are frogmen there All we know for certain is that Tomolino and his wife are living in the villa Carmelo Are you doing anything more about it,Sir? Mr Crabb,you don't seem to appreciate that Algeciras is neutral territory I can't just break into Tomolino's villa and ask him whether he has a group of Italian frogmen as house guests But you do keep him under constant observation,don't you George? Naturally I've got an extremely pair of German binoculars mounted on a tripod on the balcony of the consulate At this moment, one my Spanish staff is guarding them Is there anything else you think I should do Mr Crabb? Forzellini, come and have some wine It is not good Forzellini there are no women liked up in Gibraltar.Only monkeys There is something much more interesting for me They are working at the main entrance to the harbour Some sort of depth charge projector, I think. That man will never relax until the war is over Where did you say you found those binoculars,Rosati? -In a shop,Señora -I don't believe it Señora Tomolino would I ever lie to a beautiful woman? Of course. But my husband will find out where they came from. I hope not. As a husband I am sure there is nothing to be desired but as a commanding officer he sometimes lacks a sense of humour And you are exactly the opposite As an junior officer you are a clown ... As a husband you'd be a louse a Fellini. No woman would have him unless she is deaf as well as blind In Florence,there is one who is neither When the war is over I go back and I'll say to her - Have you heard from Maria? -Yes. Soon I shall be going on leave For 2 weeks,Maria and I will forget the war. We'll be husband and wife and love together Then when I come back, I shall fight all the harder for her sake. How far is it across the bay to Gibraltar? Four miles. I suppose there are Englishmen over there,same thinking same things as we are With those binoculars,you must see almost their faces Conchita If you don't mind I want talk to them for a minute Of course. Come ,Forzellini Sit down,sit down Now listen carefully I've had a report that a British cruiser is due in Gibraltar this evening Our job is to see that she never leaves there We shall attack it tonight, when the moon is at its weakest Until we get more supplies of warheads,I can only use one chariot Forzellini with Fellini as his driver Celloni, Neta, Neoli and Mario will standby for a frogmen attack if other targets should arrive -Celloni,you will lead them -Yes,Sir -Sir... -You will not be taken part, Rosati. -But,Sir,if Forzellini goes I should go. -You heard what I said Now carry on,everyone,leave the house at 15 minutes intervals Usual security. I'll see you all later. -Rosati -Sir I passed the British- Consulate on my way up the hill -Yes,Sir -I noticed their binoculars were missing If I thought that one of my officers had taken them I should punish him most severely This is a neutral port.We have not approve of appropriates In any case our telescope is much better But I'm sure they will be returned. No sense of humour at all It is our duty to blow up their ships ... but we are not allowed to borrow their binoculars. -Vera Lynn is passenger -Vera Lynn joined the ranks. No,serious. We are going to invade North Africa. Don't be daft,we're already in North Africa What do you think the 8th army is doing? I mean from this end. From Gib,the yanks and us Then they work their way along to Monty and his lots,see? Who told you,Eisenhower? Now look,there is a cruiser coming in this evening. For your information that cruiser is arriving for a refit before she goes to Malta And even if she were landing the whole American army in Africa Your job is still to get those blasted things ready before it's dark And not stand there gossiping, come on get on with it That what comes with eating with the Admirals Pick up bad habits -Cruiser inside the harbour -Forzellini will find it. Before he left,he told me what he called this place He said it was the most advanced base of our navy in the enemy world -What are you writing -A letter to my nephew,Sir Routine every week -How old is he? -He's four,Sir Born here in Gib just before the war. -I wonder what he'd think of it now? -He'd love it,Sir Right up his street, all this lot,Cowboys and Indians -I'd like to meet him some day -I hope you will,Sir Open Fire! Stay ahead! -Get back! It's over there -Steer around. Stop the engine. That's the first time I ever seen the enemy. -Where did you come from? -Fellini,answer the question You have questioned me for two days. I can't tell you anything more We came from the submarine" Ambra". By now she is back to Italy -We'll shall raise your chariot. -I will tell you nothing -Who is the Capt... of Ambra? -The name is Diocello Arillo. -Where did you sail from? -I can not answer that. Come in. Excuse me,Sir.I can speak to Lieutenant Crabb for a moment? -Did you find the chariot? -No,Sir We're diving from the (?) until it got dark and there is not a sign of it,Sir Then go on until you do find it The warhead didn't explode we can prepare the rest It might come in very useful some day Some might have a bit of sleep Any luck? Right,Fellini.We shall question you again in half an hour.Take him away. Please, when is the funeral of Renzo Forzellini? That's the matter for the maintenance department they dispose of the body So ,they will dispose of it Why do you want to know? He was my friend.He had courage. You work under the water? So you will understand that I would like to say my farewell to such a man. Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O LORD Lord, hear my voice: Let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications If thou, LORD, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall endure it? -Who is that officer in the boat? - He's a good man. We found the chariot,Sir. -Did you find any mines? -No. -? your work? -No. Rattler,I am going to confess only to you. What? -I'm tired. -So am I. Blinking tired Not so bad just diving almost every ruddy day and night.. when you get to spend the spare time fetching up this ruddy Italian chariot capture as well You're not likely to say a ruddy hello -We haven't got enough blokes,that's all -Ah,that's what I said Crabb last night Said what? -I told him we're three and bit overworked -You said that to Crabby? And why do you want to be a diver? Well,Sir,our ship got your signal asking for volunteers,Sir He has been in service for 18 months, and spent 9 of them under arrest absent without leave four times Don't take any notice of these conduct sheet,Sir terrible stuff they put about you,terrible You could get them for libel in Civvy street,you could so really Possibly but this is the Navy. Now,tell me why you volunteered? The excitement,Sir the fascination of a hidden world beneath the sea the poetry of moving,slow and graceful like a fish In its natural element I always wanted to try it,Sir? To break the laws of gravity To fly, up and down, or round and round The colours changing all the time. To be free,Sir,free like the birds in the sky Thank you for coming,good morning. But I was meant to be a diver,Sir I think it was the whole reason for my birth If you're not out of this office,within in 5 seconds ... there will be the whole reason, of your sudden death. Yes,I take what your meaning,Sir Got to try everything once. Best of luck,Sir Sorry,Sir When the war is over,I'll probably be asking him for a job How many more are there? 17 diving is popular this year Now that you taken over my office I suppose I could have feed you Send up some sandwiches please. If it wasn't for our arsenal of our little old depth charges That cruiser over there wouldn't be leaving the harbour she would be sitting on the bottom of it Cheer up mate, they may work us too hard but that we got our flippers I wouldn't swap them for a killing job on board that lot Or anything (?) where they call it they are just a breach from perishing perioperative From one of those men my guardian angel should protect me,forever,forever,amen -Just off,Thorpe -Yes,Sir -Very bad luck,you must obey doctor's order -Yes,Sir Shores service from now on, it comes to all of us in time - Good luck on your way to Malta. -Thank you, Thorpe.-Thank you,Sir I'm sorry to lose you. If you put that cigarette out so we might get rid of that smokescreen and discover what you are supposed to be doing Good luck,Chief,hope you have the ship back soon As long as we are not here with you Where do you think you are? Covent Garden Square that,get off Don't look now,Rattler,well I think your guardian angel is gone on leave -Italian chariot jeep -is it? Is yours? It's an oxygen cylinder Is it really? You were going to use it,were you? That's right,Chief,it's probably a bit technical for you What's wrong with your oxygen booster pump? Nothing that I know of,how's yours? You might be interested to learn my friend that I used to be an instructor in and I'm telling you that bottle is empty. When did you last change CO2 absorb cannister? -Ten days ago,Chief -Ten days Talk about Charge of the Light Brigade Haven't you not read the the Admiralty Treat Orders? CO2 absorbent granular must renewed after used from the latest ?? for further practice You might not be the one to wear that set in case of emergency And you therefore might commit murder -I don't like chose to wear it next -What's your job? -Underwater Working party,Chief -More like a suicidal squad Who is in charge of you? I want to talk to him Lt.Crabb I don't think he knows much about oxygen booster pumps either Then we just have enlighten him,why Come on,now where is he? Don't know,Chief.He's usually down here with us Of course,he might be extracting CO2 absorbents granular from the upper middle fufu valve,Chief Very humorous,come here. take that cigarette out of your mouth You had your little joke now we are going to see your officer and if we don't I'll give you absorbent granules when the monkey gets the nuts Now step? -It's a judgement, sure it is -A judgement And bring my suitcase! Able Seaman Fraser ... Ordinary Seaman Thomas ... I decided to you on as members, of the naval underwater working party Start train immediately. Any questions,Fraser? I've done a little bit of bomb disposal,Sir is there much difference with mines? Other sausage,you make a mistake,they blow up Same result exactly. Thomas? Also we really have got the job,haven't we?I mean,you won't change your mind? -Unless you change yours -No,Sir but There is one small point, I think I should mention What's that? -I can't swim -What? We were looking for you everywhere,Sir This Chief Petty Officer Chief Petty Officer.Thorpe,Sir.Specialist in Diving Submarine Escape Apparatus Having just been discharged from of HM Cruisers to shore service I was preceding through the dockyard I saw these two men -Special in DSEA? -Yes,Sir,15 years of it,Sir -Discharged to shore service? -Yes,Sir.. -You mean you're looking for a job? -Yes,Sir ... Stretching the point I suppose you could call it shore based Like to join the under water working party? Yes,Sir,I would,Sir Good,I'll fix it officially later You said we were short handed,Knowles now we've got 2 new ratings And you are lucky ,they both have got a Chief Petty Officer in charge of training Very lucky,Sir Is that all right,Sir,about my not being able to swim? Chief.This man wants to be a diver,and can't swim That's not anything to worry about,Sir Some of the best in the business can't swim a stroke on the service you'll leave him to me,Sir -Right Chief you are in charge -Get them into their quarters -Aye,aye,Sir Forward Where are the quarters,Sir? Their quarters? Ah,Miss Masters.Slight problem The underwater working party has no roof over its head Oh yes it has I just arranged it. You are in luck every modern convenience and a nice view of the sea -Where is it? -I'll show you. - Follow me, gentlemen. - Party, front march No problem,this bastion was named after '' Captain Jumper of HMS Lennox '' He was one of the first men ashore when the British captured Gibraltar in 1704 Ask me,don't better to stay in ship and mind your own business -Corporal is a bastion,isn't it -Watch your language,Fraser,ladies present Can't open really Here we are All modern conveniences and a nice view of the sea It may be a bit primitive, but one of the last available on the rock -I'm not surprised,what was the other? -The old prison. The electricity is laid down and it's got running water. Are you all right? Better turn it off before you blow up the rock -Sir -Yes? -This dog,Sir -What about it? It's a bitch,Sir Look,Sir Good,we'll train them to smell out Italians. And that cat too -Don't tell me she's got kittens? -No,Sid,just fleas Like a nice present for the Chief -We must come and have some tea sometimes -There is a kettle -Probably a home in a month. -Than you,Chief Don't you worry,Mum with a little help of these four volunteers we'll have this place ready in no time And you. Caution! We need to rub and clean. Change! Let's go! You should have started cleaning 10 minute ago.What's the matter with you Thomas. You never learn swimming there -Good morning,Sir -What's good about it? Good morning, parrot. What do you think this is?A rest home? What are you doing that for? Drinking it? Everyone up! And when I say everyone, I mean everyone Physical training is not just for your big muscles To get your pig-heads to working as well What's the matter with you? Stiff neck,shake your head, do you hear anything rattle? -No, chief. -No,I'm not surprised,put your arms down Diving training, starts tomorrow. Jump!Keep Breathing it! Keep the air. -I thought we've been trained -Not by Chief Petty Officer That's very good,Sir. Just another half hour. Thanks very much,Sir.

As soon as Fraser gets done and Thomas to come up then you two go in If you got anything to say to me,say it,don't lug it Look,Chief I'm off for a bit of practice but Rattler and I were diving operation last night For three hours,Chief -What is your first name,Knowles? -You know that,Sid. All right,Sid You and Rattler have done enough trips to know there's not just the matter of going for a swim,right? I known divers twice as many as you more Thought they knew it all,too grand to take a pressure course What happens,one day they were in a hurry,forget the drill. Get excited make too much effort,carbon dioxide poisoning Kills them just like that. Just a matter of discipline, like every thing else in this life And now that I know your first name I don't have to write it on your coffin -Are you with me? -Whatever you say,Chief -They ? staff? -Get them a penny,boy Join the the navy, learn to swim at the expense of the government. You just remember this,The Royal Navy got you out of France and when the time comes that same Royal Navy will take you back again. And in the mean time you and your (?) examine(?)that same Royal Navy and what's more you like it -What are you looking at? -The British divers. They are wearing themselves out looking for mines which does not exist.It's very funny Good,excellent Like the water boat again I'm the water boat. Why you look at me for mines? I have no mines Every day, I go to Algeciras to collect water and bring it back to Gibraltar That is the right route Algeciras- Gibraltar.Gibraltar Algeciras. That's exactly why we have to search you Miguel. Every day you make me late It is not my war,I am Spaniard! I'm neutral!I protest! -OK ,all clear -See you mañana, Miguel. Why don't General Franco take Gibraltar,and give it to the Japanese? Tonight we'll have real work to do Look at that Ammunition ships for Malta but tonight they will be anchored over there We are still waiting for chariots warheads. But we are all good swimmers The mines can do a lot of damage to ammunition ships. -Did they others sorted clear? -We are the last ones. There we are that'll make your tea taste much better Well,take it slowly Drink it slowly. Here we are Rattler. Just what the doctor ordered,eh? Come on,Jock. You get that inside you There we are,Sir,two days rum rationing in there Thanks, Chief. Bloody murderers! - Thomas! - It's best not to talk to him,Sir Takes somewhat first time been in action Quite a first time! Three ships sunk But you and the boys save the rest of them I wouldn't call that a defeat, in any language,Sir Here's the transport,Sir All right,boys I'll look after the kids,Sir,you get on Come on,my son Up we get We're going home. Blimey Bloody ??? Excuse me,mate. Stop mate I've got one officer and 4 ranking divers in there and they only had 2 hours sleep. So I would be very grateful if you I said I'll be very grateful if you'd be kind enough to find somewhere else to run the Aldershot tattoo You would,chum! Yes,chum I would All right,chum You tell me when they wake up,we send them afternoon tea and biscuits. Thank you,chum Platoon On the command dismiss fall into 200 yards down the road,dismiss -Sorry chap -All right,chum Don't worry chap we'll fit them with silencers next year better for the Royal Navy Look! Hello,the working party Jumper Bastion, Chief Petty Officer Thorpe speaking Yes I saw it,Sir Lieutenant Crabb? He still asleep,Sir -I'll don't like to wake him up -What's going on? Hold on a minute,Sir,he's just coming,Sir -Duty Officer,Naval HQ -Yes... An aircraft is crashed in the bay . It was taken that Polish general Sikorski back to England. -They want you to go -I'll talk to him Crabb here Right. We'll get going at once They found the general's body on the surface but his briefcase is still down there in the aircraft It's full of official papers We've got to get it before it is washed up on the Spanish coast. The lads are very,tired,Sir I want them fully equipped and down at the breakwater in 10 minutes -That's an order! See that's it's done! -Yes Sir. All right,boys Everybody up All right,stop -Full stop -Stand by Just about here,Sir Stop the engines! We'll go down directly to patrol ship and start from there The aircraft shouldn't be far away -All set -All set,Sir We failed.I'm sorry. Rosati, come and eat something. In every battle ... someone must win and someone must lose. -You did your best -I'll lost two of our best men And someone must die.It's not your fault. Rosati, it's over.There are other things to think about After this morning the enemy will know for certain that we are working from here -But the don't know how. -No! And they must not find out The British 8th Army advancing along the North Coast of Africa Very soon they will land another army,over there In Morocco and Algeria And the two will meet And that army,or the great part of it,will sail from Gibraltar Unless we are able to stop them -What are we going to do? -Ask for men chariots,warheads then,like the British.. Wait Wait! Wait! Wait,wait that's all I ever hear. Wait! It's 6 weeks since I sent in my report about the aircraft. And what's been done about it Nothing! Except you type 500 letters and the navy changes back to the blue uniforms Crabb Shut the door will you I sent your report, to the admiralty. They point out that the Algeciras is neutral territory and that the Spaniards are certainly not assisting the frogmen therefore no action could be taken except on the highest government authority And it is,of course,a perfectly correct decision. But the danger,Sir. I am quite as much aware of it as you are,Crabb in fact even more so The next convoy due in here will probably be the most important one,we've ever seen -The invasion force for North Africa,Sir? -I didn't say that I said, the most important one we've ever seen. -When,Sir? -Quite soon The allies aren't prepared to invade Spain for you,Crabb but they will expect that convoy to be protected from underwater attack whilst it is in Gibraltar Any questions? No questions here -Right,carry on -Sir Well? OK? I'll see you,chum Impossible -What is... -All clear here too, Miguel. Clear out,clear out You searched my cabin! Already I'm late! It's too much! Ill' complain to the government- I'll complain to the Red Cross! I've brought you a Christmas present, Miguel. Real Scotch Christmas? Is not Christmas for two months? Better take it .You might be all be blown up by then Here's one for you,Admiral This is straight,on my level? Right,on your level,amigo. To thank you for letting us search your ship so often Amigo,good man,rule Britannia! I thought you were late. -We are late? -Si So,we will be later -Arriba Espana -God save King George -Viva Franco -Viva Roosevelt. -Amigo -Amigo ¡Olé! ¡Olé! How much do you charge to take me from here to Algeciras in the morning and bring me back to Gibraltar in the evening? -Do you understand? -Si,si,excuse me. I've got to speak to you, sir. Don't look so worried,Thorpe Mainly to pop over to Algeciras with Knowles and find out how the 10th Flotilla operate What's wrong with that? You haven't asked permission from higher authority,Sir And you forgive me,for saying so I'm not prepared to let you go under those circumstances -Aren't you? -You're my commander officer,Sir And I wouldn't like to see you get court-martialled. King's regulations naval instructions,clearly states,that any officer acting without prior authority Thorpe,don't quote the book at me I am going and you are not stopping me I wasn't intending to,Sir You must ask permission first You know,as well as I do, I'll never get it. I didn't specify get it,Sir, I'd just said ask for it Of course,you must put your request in writing and then you got to see that the bloody address don't get it you know what I mean Sir? -No -Never mind,Sir What time does the water boat leave for Algeciras tomorrow? -12: 45. -12: 45! Fine! Now then In the morning, you make a written application to the Admiral as follows: Message begins '' I request permission to make a day trip to Algeciras to investigate,activities of the Italian 10th flotilla Knowing how busy you are,and in view of the urgency in this matter I should assume that unless I hear to the contrary by 12 45, permission has been granted and I should proceed accordingly" Message ends Mark the envelope ''Urgent and immediate '' and send by hand,Sir -Whose hand -No names,no petrol,Sir Help! Help! I maybe be able to speak a bit of Spanish Sir,but... -Well,how do I look,Sir -Absolutely terrible You look like a real Spaniard. Very encouraging,mate, we are supposed to be Swedes Can you suggest a god place for us to have a drink,Miguel? Try the Cafe Estepona Everybody going there. All kind of people. I leave at 6 I do not wait Good luck,amigos -What does he mean,Sir,all kinds of people? -We'll soon find out -Don't forget,I can only speak Swedish. -Not so very interesting little chat -Do you note the difference? -Which,Sir? No war.It's another world. Certainly is,Sir -Buenos dias -Buenos dias That's what I meant,keep your mind on the job Sorry,Sir Here we are,Sir Cafe"Estepona '' Quiet,you handle Spanish but anyone sees,we talk gibberish, otherwise English Keep look out for anyone that looks like an Italian. Señor,que debe ser? Dos vasos de vino,por favor -Cigarette,Sir -Idiot Sorry,Sir. I've never took a course in espionage Somos suecos Germans! Look,Sir! -You keep your mind.. -No,not that,Sir,but his arm -The tattoo! -Italian! Quick.Drink up We'll follow him. They look like sailors going back on shore leave,Sir The way he was kissing that girl,say they've been here some time A scruffy looking lad,Sir Doesn't look much like the 10th Flotilla to me I don't suppose we look very much like the British navy Going aboard that tanker, let's have a look at it Look at that Must be Italian What do you think is in those drums they are hauling? Diesel, probably. We'll know in a minute Diesel,just like you said We drawn a blank,Sir These drums could be fixed The oil might be in the tube and the rest of the drums packed with something else Special thing,Sir Your thinking was it? Did you see their faces? Blimey,Sir,there is a lot more than diesel in that drum We got to find out what is going on in that ship Get aboard,they'd stop it I didn't say we'll go aboard How long can you hold your breath under water? Lovely voice,hasn't he,Sir? We'll take it turns so do short diving The one out of service keep the look out I want to check the whole hull right up to the gunwale The water-boat leave in half an hour,Sir I don't fancy spending the night with old Caruso sing me to sleep I'll go down first Yes,along the waterline and keep your head down Sorry,Sir but seeing nothing under the ordinary I'll take the last one. Take the?? I found it.A tampered hole under the bow,Sid There must be a sealed compartment inside we'll got to get in there If anything goes wrong,you make a press for it get back in the?? What about you? It's an order,Knowles Lets breathe My god! How clever and simple! Of course,no one ever sees them They go through that hole And never make surface I'd like to blow up one of these things Come on we got to find out what is on the other side of that ??gate You were right about these drums,Sir. Full of machinery and explosive for warheads -We've got to get out,Sir -Quiet. They're coming here,Sir In the water! They are gone! Come on! It was like a gigantic factory carved out of the hull of the ship Tomolino has designed it and they built it when "Olterra" was interned The Spaniards knew nothing about it and nor did we Well,let's also accept that now they are in a harbour and where they operate And what do we next,Sir? I suggest you instruct your Chief Petty Officer on how to ride a bicycle Delayed messages is something I learnt about in the midshipman -Crabb,and I don't like them -Sorry,Sir If you ever tried a similar one I'll have you court-marshalled,clear? Yes,Sir -Can I carry on now,Sir? -No. -Have a drink. You've earned it -Thank you,Sir -Sorry, I am in the wrong rig,Sir -I told you the next convoy due here is probably the most important one we've ever had The first part of it arrived today They'll be here tomorrow and tomorrow night, on the following day they will be joined by the second and larger part On the day after that the whole lot will sail At least,I hope the whole lot will sail,clear? Yes,Sir but... But you have given me very valuable information today but your job now is to protect this convoy I don't think they will attack tonight They are not prepared for it But tomorrow night and the night after -Any questions? -No,Sir.-Good -See to it -Sir Crabb Most of the ships that came in today are supply ships,tankers and so on The main part of the North African invasion force gets here the day after tomorrow. Thanks for letting me know,Sir I wish we could attack that convoy tonight Be patient Rosati When do you get all the new boarded assembled tomorrow? -They'll be ready -Good No wonder he kept on to get us that blasted Italian chariot working. - Look at him. -He is going to test it tomorrow. Always said they coming useful one day Particularly the war head I am not with you,Sid. But if you weren't with us in the old "Olterra" either mate You'd know what he's thinking about Instead sitting here waiting to be attacked.. there will be a ruddy idea to pop over there to Algeciras with that thing and blow them all up But he explained about that.Spain, is a neutral We must obey the laws of International Procedure. Hand me that depth charge,will you? I mean we are still civilised men aren't we? There now,that should make a nice old mess of it when I drop on tonight Good luck, Rosati The worst part of this,Sir Waiting! -Think they'll come ? -They'll come! Get in Go have a look under that tanker over there You take the stern I'll take the bar Yes,Sir much quieter down there Good boy They are doing another one before she catches fire on this one Sid there in the big one! Plenty more of them.We shan't finish this jump until the morning He will be alright.We'll save his leg.Don't worry. I telephoned Jumpers Bastion the rest of your men are quite safe.They are sleeping now Thanks. You ought to get some rest too you know. No one can go on forever We'll have six chariots and warheads serviceable by this evening The tide should give you little help over the target You have done well,Rosati,all of you Very well But if we can cripple that convoy before it starts That'll be the biggest price of all Have you any work to do Nets repaired,Sir, depths charges are all ready It's a daft thing,Sir She works, Chief!I just tried it,she really works Do you know that they can see those ships,as well as we can And last night will be nothing compared what will happen tonight -I've got to do it, Chief. -All right,Sir You and Knowles going to board that chariot slip into the water under "Olterra" blow it up Just before the chariots leave her Making sure that this convoy is not getting attacked. Very necessary,Sir Nothing wrong with it -Except I haven't permission to do it -You said it this time,Sir All right, Thorpe. Good luck,Sir. Come in. I know it's late, but I must see the admiral. He is visiting the command ship of the invasion force with the Chief of Staff. -When will he back? -After 2 hours at least He's asked me to take these letters up to his house It will be too late by then. You're expecting them to attack again tonight,aren't you? They know what those ships mean Not far ago and nothing to stop them Easy meat You must be very tired, don't take too many risks. Why should I? -Could become a habit. -I'm still intact. You have a lot of friends, a lot of people who like you Whatever happens,whatever you decide to do remember that,won't you? He must be under the net by now. Then probably surface in the bay and then dive again for the run in I hope our own patrol boats don't spot him With a warhead on bows of that chariot it will be too bad if they do We'll stay on the surface,as long as possible and save oxygen. Why are you laughing at Knowles? The admiral is on one of those ships We could alter course and ask his permission to carry on If we gonna be sunk we might as well be sunk by the enemy We are ready to go at nine o'clock Good There she is,we'll be there in five minutes You stay on the chariot I'll take the warhead I'd set the fuse with short delay -Right? -Right,Sir Diving now. Here are the letters. And those are the latest signals. Thank you -Anything important,Capt.,whilst I was away? -No,Sir Except that Lieutenant Crabb wanted to see you urgently but he couldn't wait,Sir Make him an appointment first thing in the morning,would you? Yes,Sir Might deal with these and then you can carry on Thank you,Sir -Good night,Sir -Good night. -Ready, Celloni? -Ready. The chariots should go first Then the divers Stand by everybody We're diving in one minute. Alarm! We just received the signal,Sir saying that you've been awarded with the "George" Medal,Sir On behalf for myself,Leading Seaman Knowles Able Seamen Morgan and Fraser,Able Seaman Thomas,our heartiest congratulations.Sir You all deserve a ruddy medal Subtitles by Nostromo
