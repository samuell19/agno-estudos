Dad? I can't stay here anymore. ♪ I don't want to give you away ♪ ♪ I was hoping that you would stay you would stay ♪ So who's Paul? He's the Headmaster. What kind of school is it? - Private. How do you know him? College. He dated your mom before I did. After he forgave us we became very good friends. ♪ I want to know ♪ ♪ How to move on ♪ ♪ You were covered with ♪ ♪ Black and gray ♪ ♪ Waiting for your chance to run away ♪ ♪ Run away run away ♪ ♪ Left all alone ♪ ♪ I wanna know ♪ ♪ I wanna know ♪ ♪ I wanna know ♪ You know, I gotta tell you, it's about the fastest deal I've ever done in my life. You know, with a house, most people want to look every which way up and down, round and round. Not you guys, huh? You come you look, you like it you take it. Super fast, huh? How long you been up? Awhile. Yeah Paul dropped off the box of clothes from the lost and found, I guess just until we can get you some new ones. Do I wear a uniform? It's a fancy place. Please don't tell me this is all boys. Okay Wes, we got books check, schedule check, unacceptable shoes check. We'll go shopping right after school. - Great. So, you pick a sport yet? Yeah, I'm not really a big sports guy. Well, I'm afraid it's mandatory. This time of year your choices are football, fencing and cross country. Okay, thanks, Mr. Abernac. Good luck, soldier. I don't know how to thank you for this, Paul. - No need. How you holding up? Fine. Well hopefully a fresh start will do you both some good. I'm sure it will. Yes, yes, the first day hork, gotta love it. Alright, alright I'm seeing. I'm seeing some taquitos, some zucchini... You really like zucchini, huh, new kid? I see some jello there. - That's enough forensic analysis, gentleman. Gotta respect the first day hork. Welcome to cross country. How was cross country? Oh it was, whatever. Won't this kind of remind you of mom? It's not that I don't want to be reminded. I just want to have some control over it. I want you to have the car. What do you mean? Kid your age aught to have your own set of wheels. How are you gonna get around? Previous tenant just left it behind I guess. You know Dad, I've never seen you ride a bike in my entire life. Well I assure I am perfectly capable of it. See you there. Ass hat! - Sorry. God. Aw man, you got Aminheimer for trig? Better get some nose plugs, guy smells like a dying warthog. Hey Mason, here comes the circus. You know I always expect like 12 midgets to get out of that thing. There's one. Hey Goober, when do the elephants get here? Aw man, my favorite time of day. Behold the muff truck. How come we don't get to take classes at their school? Because we'd never come back. Good morning, ladies. - Hey Mason. Hey Kim. - Hey yourself. What's up Missy? - Hey Tommy. Hey Lacey. Shut up. And the area of this circle of course is Pi R squared. And then multiply by the height to give us the volume of the cylinder right? Any questions? Yes? What's with the belt? That's just something I do. Freak. And it looks like we're out of time. You have the homework and it's on the website if you need to check. So how... so how goes it so far? Great, seem like nice boys. - They're not. They're spoiled little snots who won't have to work a day in their lives unless daddy runs off with the secretary and takes all the money with him. Just kidding, of course. Bill, I don't want to overstep my bounds but... have you had the chance to talk to anybody... about Jeanie? I mean, you know once in a while call my brother or... I mean a professional, 'cause I happen to know a guy. Got a flawless reputation, well respected. Our health plan will cover everything, so it won't cost you a dime. I don't know. Okay look, this really isn't about you. You see as long as I keep up the appearance of caring about my staff it maintains my carefully crafted image of being a good guy. Got it, that makes sense. Yeah I knew you'd understand so good idea, terrible idea? I guess... probably a good idea. I couldn't help but notice that those who didn't do well on the test are also behind on their homework. So if you want to improve your grade please I would suggest you pay attention to your assignments. Make sense, right? Thank you. I thought you would... agree. You know I like to think that I'm a good teacher. But two students working together can sometimes be quite helpful. How would you like to be Miss Westmans's homework partner? A... yeah, sure. Lacy? - Yeah. Thank you, you can go now. Okay so what's up with that Lacy Westman girl? The Princess of Darkness. - You mean my future wife? Dude she would have sex with you and then eat your head. She going out with anybody? Yeah Mason. - They are not going out. Oh, really? Well what would you call it? Using her whenever he feels like it. Mrs. Oselle asked me to be her homework partner. Shut up. Dude why the hell doesn't stuff like that happen to me? Because you're nasty and objectionable at almost every level. Oh man, we gotta catch up. You're not gonna mind if we smoke you? Go for it. Sucks when the little guy beats you, doesn't it? Good luck with La, La, Lacy. Hi, I'm Lacy's homework partner. - Mom, I got it. You didn't say anything about a homework partner. Mom, I have a homework partner. Come on. You ride horses? Look we don't have to make cordial chit chat or become besties, okay. The only reason I'm doing this is she said she'd give me extra credit, which I need, because if I fail then I'd have to do Junior year over again and I'd rather put my head in a wood chipper. Okay. You can use that chair. I'm sure you've heard I'm a kind of freak, slut, basket case, but I'm afraid any hope you had of us having wild gymnastic sex are destined to be frustrated. Gotcha. My friends used to call the version of me before I met Jeanie PJ for pre-Jeanie and the person I became after we met was AJ for after Jeanie. Apparently PJ was this kind of lifeless lump and AJ was a great, fun guy. How long was it between her diagnoses and death? 61 days. I'm sorry. So Bill, neurons, neurons that fire together wire together. So when we're happy the neurons in our brain align in way that tends to sustain that feeling of well being. The same idea also applies to depression. Like what you'd expect during a period of grief. Now grief is completely normal of course. But a year or more outside of a grief inducing vent, I like to see my patients in more of an emergent posture. The good news is that we have a battery of medications available to us to help kick start you in the right direction. I'd like to write you a prescription for something called Lexapro. It will boost the levels of serotonin in your brain. And it's likely that you'll feel a little bit better by the next time we meet. Are you comfortable with that? If you think it'll help. You hungry, sweetie? I can fix you a plate. You better get it while you can. When it comes to your mom's macaroni salad I wait for no man or boy. So Mom tell us why of all the things you could have done on your birthday you chose something as boring as a picnic. Because a boring picnic let's me have my two favorite people in the whole wide world all to myself. Just being me here makes me feel so very, very very happy. Here it comes. Another Jeanie Palet spontaneous outburst of affection. - I just can't help it. Okay okay, make it stop please. You hungry, sweetie? I can fix you a plate. Okay you ready? Rules for Wes, part two, number one. You will remember that among life's many joys it can also be very hard but just know it has nothing at all to do with you. You, Wes are a bright shining star. I'm sorry, can we just stop? I just love you so much. Don't ever forget that. You guys hear about Taber's party this weekend? Please, it's an exercise in futility. I just want to touch a girl, like this. Stop that immediately. You know what you really need, Goob? You need a girl you can look up to. Oh, speaking of which, how's it going with L... L... Lacy? Dude I swear if you transfer in from North San Fran-wherever and bag Lacy Westman I'm gonna be so pissed. Yeah I really don't think you need to worry about that. Dude, you're her tutor. You're an authority figure. Chicks love that. Think that may be your fantasy Raf not hers. Seriously though, what's the deal? I don't know man, there is no deal. I mean as far as I can tell she hates my guts. Yeah man, welcome to my world. You know, it's funny, you French are supposed to be so picky about your coffee but I see you sucking down a lot of Folgers here, young lady. Well, we have to make do don't we? Listen, I got some primo box seats for the LA Clips Friday night. What do you say you an me go out we get a couple of cadillac... Listen I'm very sorry but I have to discuss a student right now so perhaps we can speak later. Thank you. Excuse me? Sorry I know we haven't officially met, but if you could pretend to talk to me for a minute I would very much appreciate it. Okay. I'm Carine Oselle. - Hi, Bill Palet. You know, I don't know if you have that expression, but in France sometimes we say better a stranger than someone you know. Oh yeah, I think our expression is anyone but him. Your son is in my class, French. - Yes. He's very advanced. Well... Wes's mother was... fluent. Was she French? No. Michigander actually but when she was a little girl she heard that French was a romance language. And she thought if she learned it her life would be... romantic. Nice, and was it? I guess it was yes. Darwinism is so depressing. If you just so happen to be born with the traits girls deem desirable then your chin deep in the booty but if not then your left out on the fringe hoping that one of the alpha males falls off a cliff or gets eaten by a saber tooth or some shit. Don't forget about being rich. That's very true, instant short cut no doubt. You know what screw this. I'm going home so I can study, get into a good college, get a good job, and get rich. It's my only hope at this point. See you later, masturbator. Later. Okay that should be... Should this be... Please leave. - Look I don't want... Just wait outside. She's in trouble, isn't she? What do you mean? For failing French. She's not gonna fail. You're Wes. You're? Annabelle. There's a girl at my old school named Annabelle. We called her Banana Bell. That's what Lacy calls me. Can I call you that? - No. - Why not? Because it's a privilege you haven't earned. No one really makes friendly conversation in this house do they? That means you can go back in. Promise me you won't tell anybody. Okay. No I need to hear you promise. Promise. Yo Palet, you realize it's been like three weeks since you last upchucked. Oh look at Wes, growing up so fast. Wes, can I talk to you for a moment? Hi, I just wanted to ask how things are going with Lacy. They're fine. Do you think it's helping? Truth is Mrs. Oselle, I really don't know. She doesn't say much. I see. Just wanted to check in. Thank you, Wes. Mrs. Westman, may I speak with you? How are you? Fine. Working with Wes, is it helpful? Yeah. - Good. You know, Lacy, in a lot of ways you remind me of me when I was your age. I think we should stick together with all these crazy boys running around right? So tell me. How are you? Really. Come here. - I'm sorry. No, no, no, don't apologize. It's good to cry. Much better than keeping all that crap inside, right? What time you have to be back to school? 2:15. - That's good. That gives us a little time if, if you'd like to talk a bit. Why are you doing this? Because I like you and because I think maybe you don't have anyone else to tell. Hey. - Hey. Just doing some prep work. There's too much shade in the back so plant the garden here, put in some lettuce and beans. You okay, Dad? - Yeah. I don't know, maybe a little out of it I guess. Should probably tell the doc these happy pills are more like spacey pills. What a drag your old man is, huh? Even on drugs, I'm no fun. Look, I really don't need you to be Mr. Smiley Face all the time. Be nice to get a break from Mr. Droopy though, wouldn't it? Tomatoes, lots of tomatoes, of course. Right. Well Mommatoes technically. Still the only person I've ever known that eats them like apples. Right. Remember in sixth grade I got in that fight 'cause someone called her Hottie Tomatie. Yeah, you stuck up for her. - Yeah. She'd be proud of you, Wes. Making the adjustment to a whole new... everything. So exactly how much of this are you digging up? I was thinking all of it. All of it, okay. Well let's get to it then, right? Feel free. What? Did you say something to Mrs. Rousou about me? No. Well she did ask about you? What'd she say? She asked how all of this was going. What'd you say? I said I don't know. Why would you say that? 'Cause I don't, I guess. You mad? Why would I me mad? I don't know. Some people really don't need a reason. She say something to you? Maybe. You know, whenever I talk to you it kind of feels like I'm on some dumb cop show and you're like the surly suspect who doesn't want to give up any information. She was just being really nice and I was wondering if you had said something about what you saw. I promised I wouldn't. Yeah? Dinner time. - I'm not hungry. You are hungry and you're eating. I'm not raising an anorexic. She said you are hungry, you're eating, and she's not raising an anorexic. - Yeah I heard her. Mom Wes is here. So, he eats doesn't he? Well, this should be interesting. Sorry for the complete absence of flavor, Wes. It was Lacy's fathers turn to cook. Lacy, why don't you tell your mother that paying the mortgage, credit cards, tuition, every other bill that comes in to this house, it doesn't leave me much time to cultivate my culinary skills. Why don't you tell her yourself? So Wes, are your parents still together? Barbara and Davis are getting a divorce but on the advice of council neither is willing to move out. My mom passed away last year. I'm sorry to hear that, Wes. I'm sorry too. The difference is I actually mean it. Tell me about the belt. That's a Jeanie thing. She used to tease me because my belt would kind of drift over that way as the day went on. Said I should just start out the day with it where it was gonna end up. So one day I just started out with it there and made her laugh. She said it was only fitting because I was a little off center to begin with. She had a good sense of humor. - Yeah. - Okay. So I find that grieving spouses usually fall into one of two groups. One describes their loved one as someone who filled a void in them. The other describes them as someone who added a dimension to the person they already were. Which would you say best describes you? It's both. Which would you say you favor? All of the above. Okay, fair enough. I'm just looking for something to help us move on. From what? From your wife, Bill. The only way you're going to feel better is if we figure out someway for you to let her go. You recognize that don't you? Yes. Okay. As for the Lexapro finding the right medication can sometimes be a trial and error process so I'm gonna switch you something called Cymbalta see if that works better for you. Fine. Bill? Hello. - What a coincidence. Back home I'm used to running into people but here it always gives me a surprise. Next. Excuse me. Hi Palet, P-A-L-E-T. 10 $. Bill I'm sorry to bother you like this but I have a favor to ask. You know Coach Keith, big muscles small brain. Extra large coffee mug. Yes, ridiculous that mug. More of a jug really. I think you could actually bathe a cat in it. Anyways he asked me out for Friday and I'm desperate for a reason to say no but I'm afraid I'm running out of excuses. Oh so you want me to be your excuse? Would you mind terribly? No that's, sure that's fine. Unless you're busy of course. No I'm not busy ever. I generally eat in the evenings. We could eat together. Yes we can eat together, that sounds very nice. Great okay, I'll see you tomorrow. Yes see you tomorrow. Alright number four. I have no idea how to say that. Do I have to say it like that? Like what? Like I'm an effeminate French man who's in love with himself? Oh that, yeah yeah, you do. You have to say it like you're an effeminate French man who's in love with himself. Then I've got the perfect homework partner don't I? You okay? I'm fine. Why do you do that? Do what? Your arm. 'Cause I'm happy, well adjusted, and really excited about my future. Of course I'm a little upset that I didn't make cheerleader this year but there's always next year and I feel like if I work really really hard it could definitely happen for me. So you're telling me nothing has happened at all. Nope. You do realize what a fail this is right? Not to mention how personally disappointing this is for me. You've been with this girl for over 10 hours. That's more time than Goober's spent with a girl his entire life. Hey Palet, tops on your strategy man. What strategy? You know, start off with the psycho whore and work you way up from there. Yeah I just hope you're banging her by now. Trust me it doesn't take half the work you're putting in. That's the other thing I hate about evolution. Why does the dominant male always have to be a dick? What does persistence dickishness have to do with furthering the species? Hey Mason. Break it up, break it up. Get off, break it up, come on break it up. That's it, that's it, that's it, break it off. Easy easy, boys. What the hell's the matter with you guys? So which one of you Nobel Lureates started this? That depends, sir, do you mean verbally or physically? - Shut up Raffi! I don't really care who started this. I already talked to the other three. And if there is so much as glancing contact between any of you knuckleheads both parties will be expelled. Is that clear? Yes, sir. - Yes, sir. Expelled, as in gee why didn't I get in to college? Oh right, I got expelled. Now I can spend the rest of my sad life selling mangoes from the side of the freeway. In the meantime welcome to disciplinary probation. You'll also be serving weekend detention on litter patrol. Everybody happy? Yes, sir. Goober. Well sir, according to the honor code we're supposed to be honest at all times. But if I told you I was happy I'd be lying. I'm very happy. - Be gone. The truth is I always imagined that I would be fantastically good at marriage. You weren't? Well it began pretty good and we found out I could not have children and it wasn't so good after that so I became a teacher. If you can't be a mother to one be a mother to many. How long were you married? 33 years. Practically a lifetime. Well I guess so but never felt that way. What an amazing thing to be able to say. We're talking about the food, but you know. Okay so I obviously didn't understand more than two words of that but this is a little... Awkward. I mean I love the French but one thing that drives me crazy is how they babble on endlessly as if anyone around who doesn't speak French is simply a piece of furniture. Well I do have more in common with a La-Z-boy chair than I like to admit. I am that way too. I mean give me a nice cozy chair and a good book. And you'll need a tow truck to get me to move. So I guess we have that in common. General unwillingness to move unless absolutely necessary. Sometimes I look at those little fish you know stuck to the side of the aquarium, you know the... And I'm like maybe it's not such a bad life. Really, a sucker fish, not a bad life? No, I mean, okay of course it's bound to become a little monotonous, but think about it. How stressful can it be? Well that is definitely a valid point. I mean you have only one job. Do you like it? - Yes excellent, very good. I can do a guppy, a guppy. - Oh, guppies are fun. Hey. When'd you get back? A little while ago. So, how'd the big date go? It went well. Well? Is that a smile I'm seeing? She's very nice. What can I say, maybe these happy pills are working. That'd be good, right? Yeah, sure. How's the running going? I'm starting to kinda like it actually. Just wish I was a little better but... Maybe that's something we can work on. We, like me and you? Yeah like, doctor Rollins said I should starts exercising. Maybe we could run together. Yeah, yeah, if you want. Okay, now what about this fight? Yeah, no, I know Dad, it's just, God this guy he's such a, he's a what's that thing Mom used to call someone she like really couldn't stand? Dingus. - A dingus, Dad. This guy I mean he's so much worse than a dingus it's crazy. Okay, but that doesn't make it a smart thing to do. I know, yeah, it's just it was stupid. Okay. Hey Dad, do you mind if kind of throw some advice your way if you're gonna start dating women? You gotta lose those tighty whiteys. Why? Well because it's practically a universal law that no man has ever looked good in man panties. I'm not sure I agree with that. Well it's just the thing is it's not really an opinion. It's kind of a fact. It's like you can't like disagree with it, you know. I don't know. Don't start, don't start with that Dad please stop, okay. Dad I'm begging you stop that immediately. It's too late it's started, once it's started... Yeah yeah, alright, that's my cue. Alright, night. See you tomorrow. Pleasant dreams. You always run this fast? This is not fast. Okay, what about breaks? You take breaks? - Nope, no breaks. This is just not gonna work. You okay? - Yeah yeah, go ahead. You sure? - Go go go, enjoy. Alright. - Oh, good Lord. Hey hey, how do you like this? Come on, Usain Bolt, let's pick up the pace. Dad you're on a bike, okay. Yeah, I'm also way older than you. What the heck? Are you trying to ditch me? Come on, pick it up. Pick it up, pick it up. Hey jackass. Starting a fight to defend my honor. Like you're some doofus knight from medieval fantasy land. He's a dick. Your a dumb ass who's lucky to still have all his teeth. Where are you going? - You'll see. What is it? Find out. Are you serious? I'm trying to reduce your dork factor. Do you have any idea how ridiculous you look driving around without a passenger seat? This is awesome. I mean, where'd you even find it? Some creepy old man on Craiglist. You totally owe me. Yeah I do. Thank you. Awkward. I was gonna hug you. You're allowed. Shit. - Watch your language. Why? You say shit all the time? - Shut up. Wes what's taking so long? The holes don't line up. ♪ Down this road ♪ ♪ Towards the light ahead that leads us straight into ♪ Are you sure this isn't driver's seat? No. ♪ Full speed ahead just like you always said ♪ ♪ Turn the page ♪ ♪ Welcome to the golden age ♪ ♪ Go live your life ♪ ♪ For the rest of us who can't keep up ♪ ♪ And got left behind ♪ ♪ Say it loud say it long ♪ ♪ Say it for everyone who told you ♪ ♪ Never sing this song ♪ ♪ Welcome to the golden age ♪ ♪ Go live your life ♪ ♪ For the rest of us who can't keep up ♪ ♪ And got left behind ♪ I'll slice and dice you, you vile little orc. Why do they call it litter patrol if they never pick up litter? It's more about being prepared to pick it up. That's litter. Well he likes to give it a head start first. Fine, I'll do it. Thanks for coming. It's a lot less boring. You mean you don't enjoy homoerotic jousting with your buddies? You know, I'm just not quite as good at it as they are. I seriously doubt that. So Mr. Abernac, he's having a birthday dinner for may dad. And I figured you know after all the amazing help that I've given you in French that maybe you could come. Oh my God, did you just invite me to a calculus teacher's birthday party? Yeah. Yeah, I did. I don't know, Wes, I mean, I'm a big girl and all but that just sounds batshit crazy. You know math teachers you get them drunk and then next thing you know they're playing spin the compass and hide the protractor. The girl is mine. Nay, all young wenches belong to me. So is that a yes or? A yes I suppose, if you can promise me I'll live through it. Everything was delicious, Missy. Yes, very good thank you. I'm glad, everyone deserves a good dinner for their birthday. Speaking of, one more. Ah. Wes, I just gave the man bookends. Why in the world would you try to compete with that? Ah. Those are hot. - They are. Wes is trying to convert me to boxers. Bill please tell me you're not still wearing grippers. I guess I am. Thank you, Son. Your welcome, Father. Well done, Wes. Now if you could just do something about the belt. No, no, no, don't lose the belt. Are you kidding? It looks like my calculus teacher downs three shots of vodka before he gets dressed every morning. Well it's actually gin, Paul. Excuse me, but a man without quirks is boring. She's right. Everyone's entitled to a few little weirdnesses. Like father, like son. Excuse me, weirdnesses? Hello, backward car seat. Hello, you're the one who gave that to me. Okay, pretending to be a pirate. Okay that, that wasn't me. Whatever, effeminate French accent. There's a lesson here, Wes. If you expose your vulnerabilities to a woman, you will be eviscerated. They are a ruthless cold blooded gender. Okay it has nothing to do with the temperature of our blood okay. Men are just afraid of strong women. They think because we stand up to them that means we don't like them when half the time it means it the exact opposite. You know, Bill, for such a mild mannered guy you sure attract some feisty women. I remember being with Jeanie one night at some bar. And this giant lecherous redneck would just not leave us alone. And finally she said you're bound to have better luck at the Natural History Museum. There's a few gals in there at the neanderthal exhibit who would think you're the greatest thing that walks upright and talks at the same time. She did have a way with words. Thank you for the ride. Thanks for inviting me. Your wife sounds like a very special person. I cannot think how big a hole must be left after losing someone like that. Thank you for saying that. I actually bought you some flowers but then I forget I left them inside. Is that some kind of sneaky way to invite me to come in? No, no, I... No, but, would you like to come in? You know I cannot believe you said I like pretending to be a pirate. Please, if I wasn't there you totally would have been doing it. Yeah okay, it's probably true. So what's the deal with your dad and Carine? I mean she's clearly got a crush on him. Yes. What? I don't know. He tries to fake it but inside he's still just nuked. You both must be. You know, for a long time we barely even talked. We didn't go anywhere, we didn't do anything. Then one day I just started doing stuff again. I kind of felt bad about it. Like maybe he'd think I didn't deserve as much. That wasn't it, I just can't think about it all the time you know. All that does is just makes it even worse. What? I don't want to do that. Why not? Because if we do then you tell somebody and then they tell somebody and then pretty soon the whole school will find out and then it just becomes another episode of let's drink crappy beer and make out. High school bullshit that doesn't mean anything to anybody. So you think I'm the guy that goes to school and tells everybody. No, I don't know maybe. - I'm not. Yeah, I know I'm just... - Just what? I'd like this to be better than that. Look, I like you, okay. You're gonna make me say it out loud. I'd like to go slow. Okay. So. What you're saying is that you like me so much that you don't want to kiss me. Something like that. Okay. I mean at least not again tonight. That's right. But, maybe, possibly, later. Yes Wesley, maybe possibly later. That's all I needed to know. I like what you've done with the place. Yes, thank you. I think it's called negligent minimalism. I hear it's all the rage in German prisons. Would you excuse me? Of course, yeah. Bill. Yes. Was being with her something... you wanted to happen? Yes. Why? I thought it might take my mind of things. Did it? No. You feel like you were doing something wrong? Yes. Why? Because it just made me think of Jeanie. Think what exactly. That Carine could never... be her. No one is replaceable, Bill. That doesn't mean someone else can't play a special role in your life. Listen, we'll try a new medication. And an augmenter on top of it but I'm worried one of the things holding you back is your own belief that feeling better would be a betrayal of Jeanie. I don't think that's the case. The larger point I'm trying to make here is that to have a chance at feeling better you have to want to feel better. Dad? Dad? Yeah. You okay? I'm fine. You sure? It's pretty late. - I said I'm fine, Wes. I just need a little air. I'll come in soon. Okay. Do you have any idea how you sound? God forbid you spend one single moment thinking about anybody but yourself! Exactly what I'm talking about. It's just because I don't believe that my life has to be a living hell. That's make me wrong. Sometimes you have to be an adult. Hey we just picked up a shit ton of beer. What do you say? Didn't I tell you? The girl can drink. Give me another. There we go, yes, there we go, drink up. She's out-drinking you, Rios. Come on Rios. Come on, juice box, what's this? Come on, man, let's go. Rios, bring him back here. Hi, it's Lacy. I don't understand what I'm doing. You're a smart wonderful girl. Just because people around you want to hurt each other doesn't mean you should do the same to yourself. You understand that, don't you? Hey man I'm just trying to understand whether or not you're with her. I promised I wouldn't talk about it. So that means there's most certainly something to talk about? See that right there. I knew it. How often do you get to see this? True happiness. Don't you think that's great? Yeah. What? Nothing. I agree it's cool. That was great. Yeah who we picking up next time? Whoever Mason wants, right Mase? Hey. I'm not doing the homework thing anymore. Wait, why? I don't know, Lacy, why don't you ask Mason? Wes, wait. Look, I don't know what you heard but... - Yeah, I heard enough. Hey, well, I'm sure that was bullshit. - Yeah, right. Don't laugh at me. - How can I not? At first you tell me you're afraid I'll talk about us and then what do you do? You go out with the one guy who's guaranteed to tell the whole God damn school. We didn't go out, it wasn't like that. - Then what was it? It was just an excuse to get drunk and... - And what? And I don't know, it was just stupid. Stupid high school bullshit? - Yeah. Like you wouldn't do with me but you will that jackass. Who do you do all this for anyway? Do what? What you do with Mason, what you do to yourself 'cause it sure as hell isn't doing you any good. So who's it for huh? Is it for your parents? 'Cause I'm pretty sure they're too busy hating each other to give a shit. Well, I'm sorry I can't be like you and just pretend like nothing bothers me. I guess I'm just one of those unfortunate people who's actually affected by life. Okay, for your information I am affected. The only difference is I don't think the answer is cutting myself to pieces or being Mason Bank's first call when he's looking for an easy piece of late night ass. Look, I may be incredibly messed up, and I may do some incredibly stupid things, but at least I'm not a self righteous prick who goes around pretending like he's God's perfect little gift. Good luck in French. Good job today, fellas. Thanks, coach. Hold up, Wes. You want to do better don't you? Doesn't matter. It only matters if it matters to you. Look, I'm not exactly the Vince Lombardi of running coaches but I could tell you this. Cross country is all about pain. Not denying or it pretending it doesn't exist but recognizing it for exactly what it is and then finding a way to push through it. Thanks, Mr. Abernac. Bill? Hi. - Hi. I wanted to thank you again for inviting me to your party. I had a very nice time. Good. There's a free concert on Saturday at McGiffen Park. Chopin, Verlouse, perhaps you'd like to go? I don't think that's a good idea. You mean the concert or? - No, I mean... you and I spending more time together. I don't think that's a good idea for either one of us. I'm sorry if I pushed you. You didn't. I did and I should have known better. Saturday, it doesn't have to be a date. I mean... - Carine, please. - we can listen to music and... - Please. You're a lovely wonderful woman. Any man would be crazy not to see that. But I just, I can't do this. I need you to understand that. Yes, I do. If Y is equal to the sine of Pi X then, then we take the integral from negative two. No positive two to the endpoint of five over two. Then we have the, no okay there should be a DX here. But that's not, that's not right. Okay, a definite integral from positive two to the end... Yes you still have to square it, don't you, Bill? Yo, Mr. Palet, you alright? Yeah, I just, just need a minute. In the old days they would have called it a nervous breakdown. I thought he was getting better. Unfortunately it's not uncommon for an upswing to proceed a downturn. The thing is Bill's connection with Jeanie was so profound that his grief is extreme. So much so that the emotional is now becoming physical. Which means what? That if we don't find a way to turn this around as bad as it is now, it can get worse. You okay? Yeah. As long as your dad is here I want you to stay with us. I'll be fine. Look Wes, we all could use somebody to lean on from time to time. I really appreciate that, Mr. Abernac, but leaning on people really hasn't worked out all that well for me so far so just not gonna do it anymore. So we can continue trying new medications, but clearly we need to do more. I want to see you in my office three times a week. And I'm going to insist that you start going to one of those support groups that we talked about. I also think that we should discuss electroconvulsive therapy. Now that may sound extreme. But the fact is it's a far more refined treatment than it used to be. Its very safe. And it's proven to be highly effective in treating sever depression that's unresponsive to other forms of treatment. Given the severity of the break you just experienced I believe it would be a mistake for us not to consider it. Mr. Palet? Mr. Palet are you still with us? There you are. So I'm going to give you a muscle relaxant and anesthetic. All you have to do is relax and take a nice nap. How does that sound? Okay. He relished the moments and I know that I'm ever thankful to God that I had the opportunity to spend the best part of my life with this person. It's just not the same. Mr. Rios, I think you will find it difficult to pass the final if I kick you out of it. Wes? How's your father? He's fine. If there's anything I can do I hope you'll let me know. Don't be last. Okay, let's finish hard, let finish hard. Alright, bring it in. Alright, for those of you hoping to qualify for SPC the trinity quads will be your final opportunity. It's also a race in which we have yet to place higher than fourth. It's a rather uncomfortable fact given that only four schools participate. So please if you bear me any good will at all make sure that you eat a large carbohydrate filled meal and that you're not late for the bus. Martinez. - Yeah, coach. Okay, that's it. Hey Wes, is it true your dad is not coming back? Dude, that's what Bobelchek said. Bobelchek's a brain dead moron. Yeah but, your dad he's gonna be okay, right? Yeah, of course. He so depressed he had to be hospitalized. They're done finding a medication that can help so they're just shooting electricity straight through his brain, but yeah, Goob. I'm sure everything's gonna be just hunky dory from here on out. So, how's the group going? Good. What do you talk about? Things people have been through. What about the ECT? You think it's helping? I'm not sure. Feel any different? Not really. Dr. Rollins says it doesn't work for everybody. Why don't you just get it over with then? Get... what? Dying. That's what you're really doing right? I know you're depressed. And I know that I'm supposed to be supportive. I'm not asking you to do anything. - Yes you are. You're asking me to just accept it. Just sit back, just watch you die just like Mom. I know this has been hard. - Yeah, you think? I mean first my mom dies and then we just pack up and leave out of the blue out of nowhere. Wes you're mom and I... Were everything. Okay, I know. I get it. But do you honestly think that this is what she would want? Mom was amazing. You think I don't miss her every single second of every single day? But here's the headline, Dad. She's gone forever and she's never ever coming back. Wesley, I am so sorry. - I don't want sorry! I want my dad back. I'm here. - No, you're not. And you haven't been for a long time. If I'm gonna have to spend the rest of my life alone tell me now 'cause if you're just gonna give up and die than maybe I should too. Wes, please don't say that. - I'm serious! That's what this is all about, right? If there's a point to all this, the living? I mean whether it's worth it to even try. Well, make up your God damn mind, Dad. If the answer is no why don't you just fucking kill yourself and get it over with? Runners set. This is Michael. - Hello Michael, it's Bill Palet. Bill. What a surprise. How are you? I'm okay, how are you? Doing well, doing well, thanks. Good, good. Listen, I'm calling because I know you were always a real supporter of Jeanie's work. Oh yeah. And I wonder if the museum would like to have it. Well, we'd be delighted. Any specific pieces you had in mind? All of it, everything. I'm sorry, did you say all of it? Yeah. Bill? I know you'll take good care of it. - Of course. That's it, you did it, you did it, kid. That was just God damned extraordinary. I'm telling you, that was just absolutely God damned extraordinary. Did you guys see that? That was incredible, incredible. Dad, Dad, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Dad. I didn't mean what I said. - I know. I'd have never said it. It's okay, you had every right. Listen Wes, Wes, Wes, hey. I'm sorry. And I'm sorry I missed you race. And I'm not gonna miss any more. Congratulations, son. Look at that. Can you believe it? Yeah, sure. You Wes, are a bright shining star. She passed the French final. Glad to hear it. But she's still in kind of a bad mood. Looks so official. I know, right? So are you like a jock now? Yeah. Figured it was time to kind of rebrand. Yeah, I mean, you did take awkward new kid about as far as you could. And plus you had brooding loather locked up so that was never really an option. Heard you passed French. Yeah, just kept hearing your dorky voice in my head going... Can we please try this again? You promise me something first? No more Mason. Thought it was gonna be something difficult. No more hurting yourself. Yeah Carine's been trying to get me to see some doctor. Promise me you'll go. That was okay? Too fast for you? - Shut up. No, I'm just making sure 'cause I don't want to rush into things, okay. Shut up or I'm keeping your medal. I was gonna give it to you anyway. Hey, welcome back, Mr. Palet. Thanks. Let's here it for Mr. P. Carine. Hello. Hi. I was hoping I would find you here. Well, you did. Yes. Do you like ice cream? I know that's maybe the dumbest question I've ever, anyone has ever asked anyone. Who doesn't like ice cream, right? Not me. - Right. Meaning that you do like it? Yeah, I do. Good because we were just about to go get some and I was hoping you'd like to join us. Who is us? Oh I have Wes and Lacy with me. You know, I figured if you came along it'd be a little less of that awkward chaperoney kind of vibe. Is that the only reason you are asking me to come? No, it's not.
