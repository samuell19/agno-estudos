[Pastor Duna] Jesus left... ...his message with us... ...and it is up to us... ...to follow... his... model. [Father Jon] I can't wait. I've got to start. We have to take this on our own hands because we have not gotten approval. And I can't wait much longer. Let's proceed. [screams and grunts] Step outside. Step outside! [screams] Fuck off! This footage was originally intended to be an amateur investigative documentary filmed by an amateur director and her friends. The footage was later found, salvaged and reassembled by an unknown entity for the sole purpose of preventing similar outcomes. ...and to serve as a warning to the public. [Talisha] Yo, that balcony is super creepy... [Gia] There's something weird. [Jandae] What's in there? [Talisha] I don't think it opens... [Gia] Yo, there is this thing that looks like a cage. I don't know if you're going to be able to see it through the window. That's so weird, it's really creepy. Come check it out. [Gia] Do you see it? [Talisha] Like something lives in there. Look at the pictures. Then we know what it says. [Jandae] Can't really see inside. It's so creepy. [Jandae] Why the hell are you putting makeup on? We're in the woods. Because if I die, I still want to look nice. Jeez. What are you now? Demon? It burns! It burns! Oh, you're going to die with your makeup on. I'm still going to be beautiful. Crazy ass. [Caro] Looks like the Gods. These are the Gods. The Gods - it's like they're praying to God. [Jandae] Can you see it from there? [Gia] What? No. This door doesn't unlock either but... I wouldn't try to go in there. It's like painted shut. Yeah, it's definitely painted shut. [Jandae] They are probably not using it. They are probably using the other one. Hello... Oh... Carolina. You look so cool, let me see your outfit. Look at this girl. You're so LA. - Let me see you, come close. - She could be so London as well. Right? Thank you. Look at that... Hold on. I need to focus... on your face. I love it. I love this thing. I know. This place is so old. Let me see, right? Inside it's something - looks like a cage. [Jandae] Yes, I saw it. I tried oh my God. What the fuck is that? [Jandae, laughs] I couldn't see it. [Talisha] Can you see it from there? [Caro] Yeah yeah yeah, oh yeah. Well, maybe they used to tie people... ...or lock them up inside while they were performing... Oh wow. ...exorcism. There is definitely something sexual in here. Or they had werewolves in there. I don't know about that. We can come tonight, around the the dick and make like a dance... I'm sure something will happen... We can... Maybe it's like a magic stick and it'll turn into something... Like a fairy... ...or like a tree fairy. It's hard to believe someone actually used to live here. [Jandae, laughs] - We got a witch in the house. - I have a stick! - [Jandae] We're good. - I'm ready for the hiking. Do you see this shit?! Oh my God. No... [Jandae] Wait... what? [Caro] Are you fucking kidding me? Yes, I see a rope. I'm trying to get it in the camera. There it is. Wow. - I touched it. This a bad sign. - Do it again. I dare you. Yeah, you will probably die just for doing that. You will probably die. Everyone is going to die. It looks like they strangled people to this tree. No, I think they strangled people to... [Jandae] Yeah, I think they - bad people. The one you touched, that's why you're going to die... First... just saying. Say hello to my production assistant. Hello. What are you doing? I'm doing my homework that you gave me. Did you find anything? I'm just like reading up kind of on the house, and like... The types of ways that people performed exorcisms. To see if we can see any clues of it but... ...to be honest... like... ...I don't think we're going to find anything. Why? What did you find about the house? I mean this stuff is so farfetched, it's like... ...you have all these stories from people who are not having any real evidence of what's going on. So of course like you can see a shadow or you can like have a negative energy. But like... who has really caught any of this stuff on camera? - Hm... - I mean... So you think these people... ...were wasting their time for decades? - Who? The Andersons? - Yeah, along with the Church. It's just so like out there to me. I really don't think like if I see an item... ...I'm not going to think it's like possessed by a demon. But that's just me. Bitch, you're supposed to say hello. Oh, hello... ladies and gentlemen. - Welcome. - [Caro] There's no gentlemen. Oh, true. It's an only ladies crew. Exactly... Girl power. [Jandae] What am I, a boy? This house is where... - A priest and two demonologists. - Which one would you choose? Isn't this one just like the other one but even better? ...used to perform exorcisms. [Caro] It's bigger than the other one. It's thicker. I take the other one. Yeah, I take the other one. [Jandae] What do you think this is? I don't want that one. [Stephanie] A big dildo! - [Caro] I'll take it. - [laughs] You would. [Jandae] Thank you. Hello. Hi. [whispers] Hi! [girls laugh] I'm so ready to crash... in the bed. - Tired, right? - Yes. Is there enough light down there? I don't know. I haven't been down yet... Hello. Hello... [Jandae] This is a beautiful house. It has a fireplace in almost every single room. [Talisha] Yeah, and it's spacious. Two bathroom. So, two bathrooms is like a huge deal - I mean for a New York City apartment. Yeah, but it's a really good price. - Are you talking about my place? - Yeah. How much is the rent? Is it like $35...? - Like $36... - Whoa... Oh but it's okay. You have two bathrooms, right? Yeah, two bathrooms, so it's good. Let me see. How do you guys like the house? It's nice and cozy. It's my birthday and nobody invited me! [girls laugh] Sorry. Ah, it's cold... Sorry. I want to be in the middle. I don't want to feel left out. I can't breathe. I wish I could see myself right now. - I can't breath. - Hi! [Jandae] Let's get up before somebody... Hi, this is Jandae Percem. We are... ...in the haunted home of Joanne and Curtis Anderson. OK, I want to go down to the basement. [Caro] If I die, tell my family I love them. Okay. Caro's family... She loves them. What are we having for dinner? I want to go down to the basement. Who's in? - Jandae?! - I want to. Okay. One. Two. Bye bye, Gia! So what they did... They applied exorcisms in their basements. Sometimes they went to other people's homes... ...if, ya know, somebody called them saying the house is haunted or someone is getting possessed. They collected artifacts from those sessions they did. Because based on what they believed in if an artifact was possessed by a demon that was the way of the demon trying to possess the owner of the artifact. So once they performed an exorcism they collected the artifact. They first blessed the artifact. And then they brought it to their home and collected it in their basement. Because they didn't want anybody else to have a hold of the artifacts. - Bye! - Anybody else? I want to investigate. Look at this one. She is so quiet... She does not want to go down. I'm not going down there. - Let's go down. - I refuse... - I'll do it. - I have to pee first. I already been down once - that was enough for me. I have to pee. I want to record you when you pee. [girls laugh] It's so nice and... Are we going? - [Jandae] Do you want to go? - Yes. Let's go. Go down. Caro! How did you get that? - Oh, you got my favorite one. - I deserve it. I come from far. She came all the way from LA. Alright, let's go. Okay, I have to go to the bathroom first. Okay... Do you want me to hold the camera? [Jandae] Bye bye. - Do you want me to get you? - Bye. Apparently things got pretty bad for the Andersons... in the last few years. They were... The house was kind of out of control for them. They believed it was the house itself, as an artifact also... ...was possessed by several or couple... demons. No matter what they did, it wouldn't leave them alone. It was pretty much disturbing the peace in the house. So they decided to sell the house and move out. They were hoping that first, you know, the next person who bought the house... ...would actually get rid of it because it's very old... ...and rebuild a new home. But what happened, the person who bought the home knowing the history of the home they have been renting the house online. People like myself have been renting it. But there are a lot of news about the house saying that people who rented the home - they heard, you know... ...weird noises in the house. [Talisha] Check out this map, it's pretty cool. Yeah, I was looking at that earlier. - New York City? - Yeah. - It's pretty old. - Yeah - super... Everything in here is old. Look at this thing. This is really old. It's creeping me out. The house is about 200 years old. - Really? - Yeah. [Talisha] Wow. Oh, that's insane. That's why I want to go down the basement. Uhhhh... I don't think so. Definitely not going down there. This looks like it's about 200 years old. - Yep. That sounds about right. - [Jandae, laughs] These are cool. Why would they put angel babies? - No idea. - [Gia] Jandae! Yeah? They were being bothered by something that they couldn't see. Some people ran in the middle of the night. Some people left the second they arrived on the premises. Some people couldn't sleep until the morning, and they just... took off. [Gia] Okay. We're about to eat dinner. Last year I was in LA. And... um. So last year I was in LA and then he said: "Hey, are you in LA? I'm going to come and see you." I was like "It's not really working out." So I'm going to show you my mom and my uncles.‚Äù Is everyone going to have pasta? - Yes. - Yes. I mean everyone is going to eat, so they will need a plate. Either way... Pasta or no pasta? - Hi, Stephanie. - Hi, Jandae. - How are you feeling? - I'm good. How are you? I'm great. How do you feel about being in this house? I feel good. It's nice... I mean, it's very old though. ...famous I guess - given its history. But it's beautiful. It's very European style, so... It's a nice getaway. - What are you talking about? - It's about Josh. You know Josh. I've been seeing him for four years. She met him at Vegas. - I met him in Vegas. - I know the story. But you know... we saw each other over the - like. He's a consultant and we were seeing each other. What's wrong with Josh psychologically... I mean... I believe in God. I'm a very godly person. I grew up... you know, Catholic. My father, he... He taught us the values of, you know, Jesus Christ. And... I believe in angels. I'm sure there is good and bad but I think, you know... You choose. You choose and it will protect you. If you choose the good... ...then demons won't have any space in your life. So... OK, psychologically I think he is 10 years older. And he wants to get married and have kids. And he wants me. And... But I don't want that right now. And... Who's an aspiring actress... An artist. An artist. And, and, and he wants me... He... He, not bought - he built a house himself. He designed it, he built it. And he just wants me to live in this golden cage. Which is beautiful but I... It's not the life I want. It sounds like a typical man. And you like him? - I like him a lot. - And you miss him? You said you like him? Yeah... Yeah. Hi, Carolina. This does answer your question? [girls laugh] I mean... Where the fuck is the supermarket close to here? We need rolling paper. I'm improvising. Look, this. Look, this, this... I'm like doing... Oh my God. I'm crying right now. I don't know about you all, but I feel fucking good. Ah yeah, because you have the good one, eh? It's dying now, but hey, it was good. That's funny. But I'm getting so tired... It's the same as that. No, where's the Bible? Hold on, hold on. Hold on. Is that what they do in Colombia? No, but since we don't have anything else... - No, you know what is good? - Remember that guy in school? He met you and he was a like: ‚ÄúOh, you're from Columbia...‚Äù Uh yeah, I do remember. [Jandae] I'll never forget that. ‚ÄúOh you... So you're an expert in drugs?‚Äù And I'm like...‚ÄùUhhhhh...‚Äù - Yeah, he was a pothead. - ‚ÄúOK, whatever.‚Äù ‚ÄúYeah like oh yeah yeah, they have the best stuff there...‚Äù ‚ÄúOkay, so what?‚Äù Say ‚ÄúThanks for reminding me.‚Äù Yeah, I was like ‚ÄúHm, OK, dude. Whatever.‚Äù [Gia] He was trying to hit on you for your drugs... He was a pothead. His eyes were like bleeding. No, but you know what? For real. You can roll a joint with the Bible shit. It's a good paper. I did that before. I did that in the school. Speaking of the Bible... Why do you have a Bible? She find it in there, somewhere. She was reading it. - Where did you find a Bible? - She was reading it. No way... I was feeling like I need to get in touch with the Bible... Yo, this place has so many angels, I'm not really surprised there is a Bible in the house. Jandae, we're trying to get in touch with the Bible, okay? Get in touch with the Bible. Let's see you get in touch... Yeah, give me... give me a shit to roll. We got to get really in touch with it. We can have it inside ourselves. I don't want to read this religious shit... [Caro] No, me neither. I want to smoke it. You're trying to ruin my high right now... Listen, listen. Well, it's getting better. Go for it. [Gia] This gets interesting. Saul died for his transgression, which he committed against the Lord, even against the word of the Lord, which he kept not. And also for asking counsel of the one that had a familiar spirit. And he inquired, not of the Lord. Therefore, the Lord slew him. The Lord slew his ass! [Stephanie] What is slewing? - [Jandae] What does slewing mean? - I don't even know. But it sounds really bad, guys. She's like, I don't even know but it's cool. That is so bad. ‚ÄúHe slew him...‚Äù He - he and then - he turned the King - the Kingdom against him. That's the end. That's the whole story. Wow... - Why are we reading the Bib-...? - [loud noise] [Gia] What was that? I think that was the door, or something... Who's...? What door? We are all here... I don't know... So you believe nothing bad will happen? No. No, because I... I know I will... I'm protected. Because I grew up living an honest... ...an honest and... You know, good life. And - and I believe if you do good it comes back to you. So, I - I don't have anything to fear... - [Gia] She's choking. - She's choking. She's choking. [Stephanie, coughs] Umm. Boy... Okay, that's good chocolate. [Laughs sheepishly] [Jandae] Oh God, you scared the shit out of me. - Jesus Christ... - Is everybody here? - You okay? - Yeah, of course. You know the house was being used for exorcisms. Maybe sometimes people died. So, since you know a lot about God... why do you think God would allow his human to get possessed by demons? I think we as human beings, and that's what Jesus Christ said... you know, we have a choice. We... We can let it in. And we can give, how do you say? We can... ...give in to anger or fear, or we just breathe and... ...wait and... ...let it go. And... - Be patient? - Yeah. Okay... Yeah. Well, I'm glad you're here. I mean it sounds - it sounds a little bit scary of course if you insist on it, but I... I believe there - there is good. You know, it'd be horrible if there was just bad... - Yeah. - So there is good... And... ...if you believe that good will win, it will always win. You just got to be strong. Alright y'all, let's lighten this mood up. How about we get this party started... Yeah! [Jandae] How are we going to start it? Oh, someone's getting naked. Oh shit... Let me finish to roll this shine pipe. We need this. Oh shit, you're getting naked. - Oh yeah. - Who's coming with me? You realize I'm filming this, right? Oh, are we seriously getting naked? Yeah, put some music - something on. Let's put some music on. I'm ready to... [Caro] Hold on. I know what I'm doing. - Gia, keep playing it. - Oh man. [Valentina] Woohoo! Talisha is going to twerk for us. Oh shit... Oh my God. The twerking battle! [girls shout woohoo] Twerk, twerk... Who's twerking with me? Come on, let's twerk. Valentina - her clothes are off. Oh my God. Valentina, yeah. Salsa, salsera, salsa! Somebody play music for them - something. Take it off, take it off. Gia, keep playing it. Ohhh my God... [girls laugh] Why are we the only ones who are getting naked? We need some music. Okay, I'm going to play something for you guys - here. [plays music on the table] Yes! Jandae, Okay, we're in this video. What are you doing? - I'm filming... - Put it there. Everybody it's a party!!! [girls all laugh hysterically] Yasss... It's a party. Tutu party, Okay. She just wants to party - tutu party. That's hot. I find this upstairs. Okay, now let's read the Bible. Oh my God, no... Not the Bible, no... I think that's a great idea. Now you start. Not for me. OK. Oh my God. And the Philistines followed hard after Saul and after his sons, and Philistines... [yelps] What is happening? [Jandae] So hold on. We got to do something with this. We got to do something with this. I'm so glad I'm not a boy right now. [Jandae] Okay, I think the light looks good. [yawns] See if we have any entities in this house... [laughs] ...that way we can film it, Talisha, Okay? Oh God, I left my phone downstairs. Do you need it? No, I'm just used to play with it before I go to bed. Oh. Hey, Jandae. Yeah? I can't sleep in the dark in this house. Thanks. Sure. I can't sleep like this. What are you going to do? I'm just going to grab something from here. Okay. That goes here - alright. Okay. That's a lot better. That works. - Okay, good night. - Good night. Honey? Yeah, honey is good. Yeah, honey. Yeah, we should record all the time maybe... Yeah, and then just put all the material together. La cucaracha? La cucaracha, la cucaracha. [Caro, speaks in Spanish] Alright, you guys need to get out of here. - What the hell? - What the fuck was that? Who put something inside there? [Caro, speaks in Spanish] No way, there is something... [Jandae] Okay, I need you all to leave. We've got some basement scenes to do. Out. Alright. - Out we go. - Peace out. We are out of here. Don't miss us. - Later, Okay? - They won't. Just go. - Later gators. - Bye babes! Alright, have fun. Just don't get raped in the woods. Oh, we won't. And you guys take care. I don't know what are you going to do. But don't touch each other too much. Okay - oh yeah, that's fine. Don't make any weird movies down there... Will do. I'll get some weird movies down there. Coffee. Which coffee? Here, here. What the fuck is that, that glass? Is that - that's what you drink coffee out of? All the mugs are in the dishwasher. Jeez. Time to go down the basement. OK, so... ...once again we are in the house of the Joanne and Curtis Anderson. The Andersons. We're going to go down the basement. Apparently that's where they used to perform... [whispering] ...exorcisms. Exorcisms. And that's where they used to keep the cursed items. They moved a lot of it out. They left some down, based on what we know and they never came back to get anything else. So, let's check it out... - Ready? - Yeah. You go first. OK. Wow. This is old. [Gia] Ew. I think these are Bible pages. They look burned. Did the house ever burn down? Did you read it? Uh -not in the stuff you sent me. I didn't read that. OK, so... Hold on. Let me adjust my camera a little. Here it is. Alright, so... ...this is weird. Well, I don't think anything should be weird anymore because knowing what used to happen in this place. Yeah, there's a... There are... ...Bible pages all over the... ...floor of the basement. These are the old windows of the house. [Jandae, sighs] Yeah, so this is... ...based on description, this is where they used to keep the cursed items that they collected from haunted homes... or whatever they thought was invested by... demons. That's a huge - huge cross. Look at this. I need to hang this on my neck, because it keeps moving. [audio noise] It looks burned too. So did they say they actually used the items in the exorcism, or...? They collected them from different homes... in which they had the exorcism - I mean haunt - you know, demonic activities from...? [Gia] Right. And, they started collecting... cursed items in which... This is fucking weird... [audio noise] Look at this. [Gia] Looks like an ang - like an angel? With no eyes. Hm, okay. Yeah, this is here too. [music box sound] Oh, it's a - it's a music box. Wait, bring it over here...? That's burned too. I have feeling this place might have burned down at one point. Let me see. See if it still works. It's missing its head, hmm. Okay, let me see... Aw, I want to put it right here. Right there... [music box plays tune] [Jandae] What's going on? Don't do that. I need the light. I'm not by the switch. [a faint whisper] What...? [audio noise] [music box stops playing] [audio noise] [Jandae] Shit! What the fuck? [weird, eerie sounds] What the fuck happened? Hello?! Guys, are you back? [knocks on the door] Oh my. Are they fucking serious? You're kidding right? Oh, hi. Hi, I'm... Father Jon. The parish priest. I... Did you buy this place? - No, we're just renting it. - What are you doing here? We're filmmakers. We're just shooting a documentary about the house... You shouldn't be here. What do you mean, ‚Äúa documentary here‚Äù? Well, the house was a - belonged to the Andersons, right? Two demonologists. And apparently people think the house is haunted. That's right. That's why you are taking... ...some risk being here. You shouldn't... film here. Wou - would you like to come in? Okay. Okay. We'd like to, you know, hear about the house, - a little bit more. - Right this way... Okay. First we're just... all a little spooked. [Jandae] Jeez. Weird. One of the doors just slammed. Father, is it okay if I keep recording to get some some information from you? - Sure. - Yeah? That's fine... That's fine. So... So to tell you how, you know, we... ...we got in here... We - we were... We're actresses, right? But I decided to get into making documentaries, directing. And we heard... I heard a lot about this house. We did some research, and it belonged to the Andersons... - I'm assuming you know them. - That's... Yesss. Yes. Okay, so we rented the house from the new owners of the home. They're kind of using it to rent it to people who... ...you know, have interest in haunted houses I guess. I don't know. Um. So, we are just... staying here a few nights to see if there are any paranormal activities going on. - That's what we heard. - I wouldn't be surprised... Hm. You know there were exorcisms here. You said so. - You said you know about those. - Yeah. The Andersons, yeah? Well... Up at the church - we'd occasionally... ...help here, help them on... ...exorcisms. When... when we couldn't wait for the Vatican to approve... We came here and... ...did them here, in this house. Yeah. And do you think that's ethical? I... These were things that... Decisions had to be made. There was no time for... This was ethical. This was... This was proved by the Church eventually. But we had to sometimes accelerate the process a bit. And... ...that's why you... You're taking some risk being here. I'll just tell you that... I don't think you should stay. I don't think you should stay here. Besides the fucking door slamming... I'm sorry, excuse my language. We haven't really seen anything yet but we were in the basement and... May I have some water please. Water? Yeah. - I can go grab it. - You got it? [sighs] Some water... So... Father thinks we shouldn't have... ...anybody here. Which is interesting because - I paid so much money... - Jandae! - Yeah? - Bring the water. I think he... He looks really bad. Okay, okay, coming. - Jandae, I... - Are you OK? Thank you. Uh... are you - are you feeling sick? What's...? Are you Okay? Uh... It's not safe here for any of you. You should not be here. You should... Yeah, we're - we're going to leave anyway. So... Um. Well. Okay, um... - You've heard my word... - Yeah, yeah. No of course. I can't stay. We'll definitely get going very soon. Yeah, I'm sorry. I just don't feel welcome right now. No, thank you. Thank you so much for - for coming. We - appreciate it. We will leave here soon, in a few days. It's not safe. It's not safe here. Here, I'll get the door for you. You've been warned. Yeah? Okay... Yeah... yeah oh we totally got it. We're going to leave. We're just going to do our thing and... leave in a few days and... like... I - I don't think you... I think you should leave now. I think you should leave right away. I don't think you should be doing any of this. Yeah, we will. I don't think you should be... taking this risk. Th - thank you, Father. Thanks for stopping by. [Gia] That was really bad... He like broke out into a sweat. He is an old guy. I don't know, it was like really weird. I... like... We should seriously consider... Are we - are we going to go? Dude, you don't believe in this shit. Come on. He's an old guy. He's like 90 or 80, or whatever. Your call. What the fuck was that? The door slamming? I kind of thought there was someone in the house. [sighs] Alright, let's maybe find out where - where the girls are. And join them or something. And turn this off... Come, talk about the Andersons. Well, apparently they used to work with the priest we met earlier. And what I heard is that they used to work with a few... different churches, not just one. So he must be one of the priests, I don't know. Um. It was creepy down there. Hello...! - We're back. - Hey ladies. - How are you? - Hi. How was the hike? OK. Here, here. We'll get you some more coffee. Caro is not feeling well. I'll sit here. ...so we came back a little earlier than we... What's wrong, Caro? - Here you go. - Thank you. Do you need some cookie or sugar? We should just let her rest. The hike was fun though. [Jandae] How was it? Did you take pictures? - Yeah, we did. - Let me see. - There's no service. - Mostly dead trees. What do you mean ‚Äúno service‚Äù? Oh, yeah. There's no service anywhere. Strange actually... - Nothing. - Like none? Yeah, but I think it got a little bit boring after a while. Well maybe that's a good thing we don't have service. So you actually have to stay away from your phone a little. [Valentina] Get to know each other. - Get to know each other. - Cherish our love. And bond, sisterly bond. Oh really. I'm trying to post some shit on Instagram though. What happened? Too much pot? I don't know. How was the basement? My stomach... The basement was cool, besides the creepy-ass priest showing up. What? A priest? Poor guy. Yeah, a priest came. And telling us we should... we should take off. And we were like... ‚ÄúYeah, we will.‚Äù and then I left him alone with Gia - for like two minutes. - What did you do? I'm trying to adjust the camera. I left him with her... Guys, did he like say a prayer? He almost like fainted when I walked in the room... Yeah. No, I was just really worried. He was just like telling us about these exorcisms. And then he just got real sweaty and stuff. It was weird, and then he was like "I have to go." We're like ‚ÄúOK, that was really abrupt.‚Äù Maybe it was the demons in the house... Maybe he was like a homeless person. It was a priest. [girls laugh] [Jandae] A homeless person - pouring him a glass of water. It's like Okay, we're not in New York City. We're outside the city now. What happened to this girl? I don't know, I feel sick. Was that person here for real or are you fucking around? No, really. I'm not kidding, he was here. Tell them. - Really? - He was here. [Gia] His name was Father Jon. And the lights went off while we were in the basement... - I don't believe that. - No way. You're lying now. - I'll show you. - You want to go down there? No, I'm good. And then - hold on... What happened next? What? Oh, the fucking door like slammed shut! - [Jandae, whispers] Yeah. - What? - You're kidding. - No, I swear to God. You're trying to scare her. But then the door was open. That window right there was open. Maybe it was the wind. Yeah, I think that's what it was. Since it is an old house I guess... you know. It's a very old house. It's expected for things to fall apart, or you know. Yeah. What's wrong with her? Let me check her fever. [slamming sound] [repeated slamming sounds] [sounds building up] [distant screams] [door knob is forced] Jandae? Jandae. Jandae. Jandae. Jandae. - Jandae. - What? Did you hear that? There's something down there. - There is something going on. - What are you talking about? - [screams] - Hear it? I don't know... Oh my God. Talisha. Talisha. - Huh? - There is somebody in the house.

Are you OK? Oh my God. What the fuck... There's a little door in this shit? What the fuck? What the fuck is wrong with this house? - What happened? - Oh my God. - Babe, what happened? - What is it? Are you Okay? Well, what were you doing down there? Hold on, let her breathe. Let her breathe. Hold on, let her breathe a little. We really need to do something right now. Hold on. Let her breathe. Give her water. Here, drink some water. What's wrong, Caro? Do you need to see a doctor? - She's not herself. - She looked at me weird. [Stephanie] She looked at me really weird. - [Caro, burps] - Are you okay? [burps] Jandae... Alright... I think she's going to puke again. Hold on. She's going to puke again. Get something. Get something. Just get something. If - just puke. If you feel like puking, just puke. It's okay. Alright, I think we need to get her upstairs or something. Hold on, let her breathe a little. - Dude, please. - What? Don't you see her? - Could you please stop... - I'm not doing anything! We really need to do something like right now. Can you like turn the camera away please? It's off... [Stephanie] You're freaking me out, Caroline. Babe, listen. Maybe there's someone around...? I don't know. Maybe she wants to see a doctor. I don't know. - I don't know... - Does the telephone work? I just feel like throwing up. Why did you come in there? I didn't even know there was a fucking bathroom in there. Why didn't you go upstairs? I don't know. I - I don't remember. [Burps] What the fuck? When you went to bed was everything OK or...? I just felt like throwing up... - Dude, just cut it off. - She's really... sick right now. Now I remember... Being here... [distant whispers] [birds chirping] What's Valentina doing out there? [Stephanie] Smoking? - As usual...? - [Stephanie, laughs] Gia... Yeah? Let's go down the basement. Fuck, no! Ask one of the other girls. But you're my production assistant. We got to go down together. Hm. I'm good. [Stephanie] I'll go with you... - Really? - Mmhmm. Okay. Maybe let me ask Valentina too... So she doesn't poison herself smoking, back-to-back... Alright... It is beautiful out here today too. [dog barking in the distance] Hey... Hey. You smoking? You keep getting out to smoke, but you look good under the sun... Oh, thank you. - Getting your tan on? - Ah, yes. I need every little bit of it, on me. I'm interviewing everyone about why they said yes... to coming to the house. No. I'm just... I don't know. Just feel a little bit... under the weather. What's wrong? I don't really know. I think I might be... ...food poisoned too. Well... I heard demons have big dicks. Like huge ones. No, I'm kidding. But no, seriously... I don't know. I just think it's really beautiful in here. I just need a - a rest from the city... - Yeah. - And everything. - New York City is tiring. - Yeah, a lot. Well, do you believe in demons? I mean you grew up with death, you said. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But demons, itself? I don't know. Um... I'm really respectful about the whole thing. Oh God. It was bad last night. - Yeah. - Do you want anything? No, I just... Just want to take some fresh air. Did you eat? Maybe you should eat something if you haven't... I'm not hungry... Just - I just wanted to be by myself. Okay. Well... I want to go down the basement... ...to you know. To film, you know, the stuff they had down there. That's where they used to, you know, do exorcisms, so... Would you come down and you know...? Do you need me to go down with you? Gia doesn't want to come down, so... You know, I think we should all go together so I can... use it for my documentary. Okay, yeah. It would be more fun for all of us to be able to go down there. - Thank you. - Okay. Are you sure you don't want anything? Nothing to eat? - No. - Okay. [sighs] Alright... - Cause of your... - Yeah, it's just better to... ...to keep a distance, and just be respectful. And being here, it's not exactly like we're playing with it... ...the whole demon shit. Okay, so, Valentina. I'm going to have Talisha hold the camera, Okay? Umm, Stephanie, you hold the door. Yeah. Yep. Don't ask why. Just hold the door. Alright... Talisha! What?! I need a nap. We're going to go down the basement. Gia doesn't want to hold the camera. Can you hold it? How do you feel about dead people? I don't know. I'm not really sure about that. I think... ...maybe if you get to disturb them that would probably be bad. You just need to leave them alone. Yeah. Does that mean I should leave you alone then? Probably. I was just getting myself ready... ...to this whole thing. And I was just talking with my friends. Meet him... - Who? - [Valentina, laughs] [audio noise] Rock friend. Okay, well... Enjoy the conversation with your friends. Thank you, love. Thank you for being a part of my documentary. Oh, thank you. I love to be here though. I'm glad you're here. Adios... Bye bye... Oh, is this the big dick you were talking about? That's a big one. [Laughs] There's going down there... Yeah, just a few minutes. So, we're going to go show the artifacts in there again. So you're just going to record me. I'll hold the camera until we go down. Uh, here. Have fun down there. Yeah, we will. I know. It's old. And then - that's where they used to cut demons apparently. So, let's just go - down... Alright, so... Well, this is where we came with a... Gia. Do you want to hold this as I'm talking? Where is Valentina? Okay. So... This is where the exorcisms were being performed. We don't... We kind of figured out these are burned Bible pages. We don't know what this is about. Apparently someone did something. - [lights flickering sound] - Um - What the hell? Something is wrong with the lights, yeah. These are the artifacts apparently the cursed some of the cursed artifacts... ...that they collected. They were haunted at one point based on what they said. Looks like a cross here also got burned... Looks like it's been here for a while - that's a big cross. Um - They said, based on my researches, there used to be a... ...bed here somewhere. Um - The bed is now in that little house which we didn't know what it was. Apparently the bed is there. And then... let me have this. There is a... There is a - this hole here. And then... I want to go in there to see what's in there. Inside the hole. [demonic scream] - Oh my God! - What happened? [Valentina] Oh my God! What the fuck did you do? - [Talisha] I didn't do anything. - Are you crazy? That's not funny at all. - Did you touch her? - I didn't touch her. - It hurts a lot. - What are you talking about? Oh my God, what you did... What the fuck is wrong with you? - What did you do to her? - I didn't touch her... Open the door! Open the damn door. Right now! - [Stephanie] I'm opening it! - Open the door! I'm opening it! You fucking crazy! Why the fuck are you holding the door? You weren't supposed... I wasn't holding it...! I don't know what the fuck is wrong with you... - Why would you do that to me? - What did I do? - It hurts like a bitch! - Let me see... - Did you hit her? - I didn't hit her! I didn't. - Did you hit her? - No. She would never hit her. Why? That's ridiculous... What the fuck happened? Valentina, come here. Let's see... - Wait. - Fuck. It hurts a lot! I'm coming... It really hurts. It hurts. [sobbing] What happened? - Oh my God. - Shit. - What is it? - Oh my God. What were you guys doing down there? - I didn't do that. - Of course you didn't. How are you going to do that? - Do you want to sit down? - We should get her to a doctor. - Please don't touch it. - We should get her to a doctor. It hurts a lot. [Sobbing] Oh my God. Shit, shit, shit, shit. Get some... alcohol, something. Okay. From down - There is a bathtub. Bring the vodka, something. [Jandae] Fuck. What the fuck happened down there? I don't fucking know, dude. There's no... There's no way Talisha did that. Jesus Christ... So who did it? I mean... Babe, that's... that's... there's no way. I don't even know what to say. Caro? Caroline? Hello? Caroline. You okay? [Stephanie, whispers to herself] [sobs] [whispers to herself] Hey, Stephanie. What's going on? Nothing... Stephanie, wait wait wait. What happened? It's nothing. Stephanie, stop. What happened? - Tell me. - It's nothing. Nothing. It's Okay. - Hey, what's wrong? - It's OK. Gia! Yeah? Something is wrong with Stephanie. Can you get here? I don't know. She's crying. [Stephanie, sobs] [Gia] Where are you? Babe, are you okay? What happened? Nothing, it's okay. It's okay. [Sniffles] - It's okay. - [Gia] What's the matter? - What happened? - Nothing. It's fine. It's fine. - Did someone do something? - No, no. It's okay. Just had a nightmare. [sniffles] It's - it's fine, it's nothing. We should - I don't know. I just... need some water. Um. [Gia] Alright, leave her alone. Come on. I'm... just go outside. - I want to go outside. - Jandae, let's go. - Just give me a second. - Jandae, come on. Jesus... Dude... [Jandae] Just give it to me. I'm not going to film her. Just give it to me. [sighs] [sighs] Caro doesn't look good. I'm so scared. I'm scared, I don't know what to do. I'm risking the life of my friends. I want to talk to Valentina and we're all going to leave in the morning. We're not going to stay here... ...any longer. Otherwise, I can never forgive myself. [sighs] [knocks on the door] Valentina, it's me, Jandae. Are you sleeping? Where's light here? Hey, Valentina. You're awake? [sobs] [sighs] Valentina. Caroline doesn't look good. [sobs] You don't look good neither. Something's happening and I'm so scared. I think we should leave in the morning because... Caroline doesn't look good and... I think we should go. [snickers] [deep, evil voice] I like it here. We should stay. No, no, no. We should go because... [sighs, sobs] I don't know what the fuck I was thinking, and I'm so sad. I can never forgive myself if something happens to you guys. And you don't look good either. You go. I can't go without you guys. I can't leave you here. Go. No, no. We need to go. Get out. No, no. We need to go. Get out! Now! No, we need to go. Get out! [Jandae, sobs] [footsteps getting closer] [door squeaking] [footsteps] [blood-curdling screams] What happened, Talisha? [sobbing uncontrollably] What's going on? I'm right here. It's okay. It's okay. You saw a nightmare. It's okay. It's okay. It's OK. What happened, Talisha? What? Talisha. It was a nightmare, you're awake. Girls! It fucked me... Look, windows are closed. Something - something touched me... Where the fuck is everyone? [sobbing] OK, so you believe we'll just stay here and have a good time and ...that'll be it - most likely? - Yeah, of course. - [Jandae, laughs] - OK, well... - We have the beautiful nature... I'm glad you're here, it's good to have a believer. - Just in case. - Yeah. ...we get attacked [whispers] by the demons. If not, pray for us. I'll - I'll pray for you. Okay, thank you... So, yeah, like... I don't know. I... I checked the windows. They were locked. I... [sighs] I looked everywhere. Obviously you all were just smoking weed outside. At that time I didn't know what the fuck you were doing. I came downstairs to see if there was anybody. But there was no one and... And... That is like so upsetting. I have no idea, like... ...I know you're saying nothing was in the room, but... How could she react that way and and not have something...? - I don't know. I have no idea. - I have to pray for her. I was sleeping with her all night. I was in the room. Look, if there was somebody, I would have seen it, okay... Jan, I really think we need to, like... leave... Like... it... I - I know, we have to pray. I... I... There is something going on here. I read it... um... ...in the Bible. And... we have we... we... I'm going to pray for her tonight. It's um... This isn't about the Bible. Something... - It is! - Something obviously happened. - Something's going on. - Stephanie... I know it because I read the Bible. Do you read the Bible? No, because it's a load of shit. Something is obviously... It's not! How can you say the Bible is shit?! Because something obviously happened to Talisha. And there's nothing the fucking Bible can do about it. We need to just get out of here. Like, this is ridiculous... One of our friends had this situation happen to her and we have no idea why... - Wait... you you. Hold on. - I'm done. Wait, you actually think something fricken like... - ...raped her in her sleep? - I don't know, Jandae. But it's obvious that something very traumatic happened. And I don't want to stick around to see it happen to anyone else. You know the same thing that's happening right now... it's you're traumatic. I have to pray for her too. You think that there is something in the house that's doing it? Or was she just having a nightmare? - I mean, I was... - I don't know. It's scary... ...if you think back. It's getting worse. I don't know. Something's going on here, and... This is not right. Totally not right. Um... Wha?? [sighs] I don't know. I guess... ...we can just leave in two days, okay? Well, we - we paid already for the house. We - we just pray. We'll be fine. I don't know. Praying isn't going to help obviously... Shit is going down, but... We can't leave any earlier. We don't have service here. I have to... - Did you... - I'll have to see what I can do but we can leave in two days. [sighs] Okay, I think something is wrong with Caroline. I'm going to find out what's wrong with her. And then I'm going to let her get out the house. Caroline? [whispers to herself] Caro? [whispers in Spanish] Caro, I'm here. Do you hear me? [whispers in Spanish] Caroline, I'm right here. Are you okay? I want to know if you're okay because... I don't know what's wrong and if you... ...if you want to go, you can go. You don't have to stay. [sobs] [speaks in Spanish] Caroline, you can go. You should go. I don't know what you're saying. You should go home. [deep voice, speaks in Spanish] I don't understand what you're saying. I think you should go home because you don't look good and... [deep voice] This is our home. [deep, distorted voice] Our home... [very deep, distorted voice] I'm not going...! You goooooo...!!! Gooooo...!!! Go...!!! [sobbing] ...I'm doing here... I rented the home because I want to prove... If the house is haunted, I want to prove that it is. And that the demons exists. This could change a lot of things. Not just for America... but for the Vatican. ...if I have a proof in my hand. And it would also make me the successful director that I desire to be. Thank you. I'm going to go down there and... I feel like I'm the only one that's... That's still okay to go down there and really find out what's going on. [sighs] Okay. Okay. How the hell did you get in here? [sighs] [music box plays tune] [sighs] Anybody in there? Is there anybody in there? [sighs] What the fuck am I doing? Okay... [music box plays tune] What the fuck? [weird, eerie sounds] [very loud noise] Shit! Shit! Shit! [breathing heavily] Oh my God. Okay... Fucking music box... Fucking music box... Ah fuck. [Sighs] Oh my God. I need to get the fuck out of here. I need to get out of here. Ah, what the fuck? [breathing heavily] [moans and chokes] [moans in pain as her bones crunch] [crunching sounds] [demonic groans] [crunching sounds] Hey. Hey. [sighs] You've been in bed all day. How how are you feeling? [Sniffs] I don't feel good. I just - I want to go. I want my mom to come get me. I know, I know. I wish we had service to get someone, but... Tomorrow, we'll just get on the road and... ...whoever picks us up, we'll just go home, okay? I just want to go home. I know. I looked at the camera last night after I... I mean this morning... After you told me about what happened. I saw you move, but there was nothing in the room... [sighs] There was - there was something there. I know. No, I... I believe you, I really do believe you. I... I think there is something in the house and... We're going to go tomorrow morning, I promise. We're just... ...going to take off and... I don't want anybody to feel sick anymore and... Do you want me to bring you any food? Anything? No, I don't want anything. I just want to go home. I just want to go home. Okay. I promise we will. [woman moans loudly in the distance] [door sound] Jandae, do you hear that? - Is that Caro? - I don't know. Why don't you go see what it is? Hold on. Hold on, hold on. Let me go. Is there someone here? Hold on. Hold on. [Gia] Caro, Caro? [Jandae] Caro? What the fuck? Gia, can you check that bathroom again? The bathroom. Just check the bathroom. [Gia] Caro? No. Where is she? Where is she? Caro? [moans loudly] - [Gia] What the fuck...? - What the fuck is going on? Shit. Caro, what's going on? Shit, she went down that place...? Carolina! What...? What are you doing here? Dude, let's go. It's freezing. We need to get out of here... Caro, what's going on? What the... - [Caro, animal groans] - What are you doing? Caroline, what are you doing? Oh my God! What the fuck!? [chants in Spanish] - Caro... - You need to drop that. Oh my God. Caroline, you need to drop that. Caroline, you need to drop that. What the fuck did you do? [chants in Spanish] That's a fucking rat... [crunching sounds] Caroline. Take that away from her! Take that away from her! Take that away from - Take that away from her! - [Caro, moans] - Oh my God! Jandae, we got to get the fuck out of here right now! [powerful demonic scream] No, I can't leave her like this. [speaks in Spanish] Caroline... [shouts in Spanish] Caroline... I'm so sorry... I'm going to fuck you in the head!!! You don't want to fucking stay!? [girls scream] [heavy breathing] Stephanie! Stephanie! [Jandae and Gia scream] Gia, Gia... Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. Talisha. Talisha. Talisha. Talisha. We have to go. Talisha... [deep, demonic voice] Get the fuck out! Get out. [screams] Get out! [girls scream] What the fucking hell is going on?! Gia. Gia. Oh my God. Gia. [hectic breathing] [sobs] Jandae...! Gia. Gia. Gia. Jandae, why did you take us here? Where are you? Gia, oh my God. - Come back. - Gia, we need to go. - Gia, we need to go. - Come back! Gia, we need to go. Gia. Gia. Oh God, please? Oh God, oh Jesus Christ. Gia, Gia, we need to go. Gia, we have to go. Gia, we need to go. Oh God. Oh God. Oh God. [Gia] Are you leaving? Gia, we need to go. Gia, Gia. Please, let's go. Gia, let's go. Gia, let's go. Gia, let's go... Oh my God. How are we going to forgive yourself in hell? [hectic breathing] [static sound] The camera was turned over by a former member of the Church. Two individuals were found dead due to unknown causes, and three others are still missing. Jandae is the only confirmed survivor and currently resides in a psychiatric hospital in New York.
