Come on, give me a little... Aww go away. You shouldn't have done that! I told you to keep your filthy hands off me. If it wasn't for your sister, Carmelita, I never would come around this dump. You couldn't buy enough booze to make me go for you. Why don't you try some of those sideshow freaks? You dirty, filthy pig! So, I belong with the freaks, huh? I'll fix you so even the freaks will not look at you! Ortega! Take him and make him like my other little pet! You pig, I'll make you look like... [inaudible] Ortega, look at him! - What's wrong? - That cat, get him out of here! Alright, but why get all shook up about a cat? I can't stand them! Every time I get near one something strange happens to me. Why don't you lay off that stuff? Why don't you lay off the father routine? Look, honey, I'm just trying to give you a friendly bit of advice. Those mistakes in your routine last night almost cost you your job! Okay... I'll give it a try. Just for you. Look, I'd rather you did this just for yourself. Maybe so... maybe not. I think it's about time you left, Harold. What do you think? I dunno, Jerry. What do you think? Well, if we're late, Angie's just liable to blow her top. Yeah, and her mother wouldn't like that, would she? Her mother doesn't like anything... ...especially me. Well, if you get a job or something she might change her mind, ya know? A job? Be a little discreet about that, Harold. Somebody's liable to hear you. You gotta do something, ya know? The world's here to be enjoyed... not to make you depressed. That's what work does, Harold, it makes you feel... depressed. So, instead of being in that state of depression, why don't we cut out, okay? Swingin'. No... No, I'm sorry, Phil, I can't. No, I made other plans for the day. Uh huh. Okay... Bye bye. Who was that? Oh, Phil. He wanted me to go to the beach with him today. Well, why don't you go? Um, I can't. I have a date with Jerry. I don't see how you can prefer Jerry to Phil, when Phil is such a nice boy. I like Jerry. Phil just isn't my type! You're fascinated by Jerry because he's different. He isn't like any of the boys you know. Oh, Mother. Jerry is fun, exciting. We go places I never dreamed of before! You're right at the age where you could make a terrible mistake. And you think Jerry would be a mistake? - Yes I do. Jerry has no education. He'll never be able to make a living. - Oh, Mother. If you try to build a life with him, you'll be miserable. Really, Mother. You're way ahead of me. I just have fun with Jerry, that's all! Does he always have to honk that horn and drive like a maniac? All the boys do, Mother. That's the way they are. Hey, are things that bad, you gotta wash your own car? Things are rough all over. Yeah, the world's in a state of depression. Angie, please don't go. But I like Jerry so much. Some day he's going to meet a girl that is just his type. - And you'll be hurt. - I don't think so. He didn't even come to the door for you! It wouldn't be Jerry if he did. Angie, baby! How's college? Fine. You should try it sometime. No, thanks! The world's my college. Let's go! See you later, Madison. Get your tickets here! Get your tickets! Get your tickets! Get your tickets here! Hey, Harold! Let's go! Come on! Oh, Harold! Don't do that! My first night on the floor was a real spectacle. That's the last time I'll drink before a performance. The manager wanted to fire me but he's a friend. I talked him out of it. But my wife did say... now she's really something... If I didn't stop drinking, she was gonna leave me. Boy, I'm sure gonna miss her. But ya know, with my wife, there are two sides to every argument... My wife's and her mother's. But they're really wonderful. Miss Marge Neilson and Mr Bill Ward. Let's have a big round of applause. Hey, Marge, are you alright? Just leave me alone, will you? Okay, okay! Look, I warned you last night to lay off that stuff! I know. I'm sorry. I can't run a nightclub with a drunken star. Now you take the next show off... And if you're not back in time for the third show, and sober, you're fired! Here you are, folks, the biggest bargain to hit the midway. They'll thrill you, they'll kill you. You'll even ask for more! 20 beautiful girls, supple as a serpent, twisting, writhing and winding. The most spectacular show ever to hit the midway. The Garden of Eden, folks, and none of the trees have leaves. Adam and Eve never had it so good... [inaudible] ...see everything for only 50 cents! The biggest bargain to hit the midway! It's not on film, folks. It's a living, breathing, vibrating show right here on our stage! You say that isn't enough? You say you want more? Alright, after the show, we raffle off one of the girls. So you may be the lucky one. Yours will be the pleasure of a private show! Welcome, my dear! Won't you sit down? - Thank you. You wish to have your fortune told? Yes, please. It is a thing one must be sure about. But it is a grave responsibility to learn one's future. I'm willing to take the chance. From the expression on your face, it would seem to me you are searching for something. I'm not sure what it is. I only know something evil lies ahead for me. Do you feel that your life might be in danger? I only know that something will happen. I have to know what. Then we must consult the cards. The cards will tell us if we are in danger. What did you see? I'll look for myself. - That's the death card, isn't it? - Yes. I knew it. I knew it! No! Not that way! Never mind, folks. Just one of the many attractions we have going at all times. What's wrong with her? Well, whatever she's running from must be in there. Come on. Let's go in there and get spooked, okay? Yeah, Jerry. Come on. Let's get our fortunes told. I can find a lot better ways to spend my money. - Come on! Don't tell me your feet are starting to freeze. Oh, I'll try anything once. Ugh. It's dark in here. Look, Jerry. A crystal ball. - How about that. Let's have a seat, huh? You wish your fortunes told? - What do you think we came here for, to eat? I'd like my fortune read. Cards my palm will deal her. - Okay, how much? - Fifty cents. Thank you. Give me your palm please. You are a very fortunate young lady. You are going to be lucky in love. I see only one husband for you. This is a remarkable [inaudible]. You are going to be rich, if you are not already so. I see that your mother will not approve of the man you pick for a husband. Okay, when are you gonna use the fishbowl? I use both the crystal and the palm for my readings. The crystal shows the immediate future. The palm shows the indication of one's entire life. The use of the crystal is very dangerous. Why do you say that? Sometimes, the crystal sees things it is better we do not know. What is this? What do you see? - I see much unhappiness for you in the near future. Someone near to you is going to die. - Oh come on, now. The crystal does not lie! What the crystal sees... It reveals. I see... someone... Yes...! It is you! By water... Now... I see a man... I can no longer see you... Now the man moves... Yes... you are now on the ground... By water... I can no longer see anything else. Well, now that you read her fortune, why don't you tell me mine? There is nothing I can tell you! - Why can't you read mine? There are some who cannot be read. Their life is but a shadow in the crystal. You are such a person. Come on, now. Tell me mine, will ya? I cannot tell you anything else now! I think you clouded up her crystal ball. Clouds affect only the cloudy. Never the image. Why don't you come back some other time, Jerry? Sure, I'll come back again. You can bet on that. I will charge you only for the young lady. - You bet you will. Which is the way out of here? That way. Come on. Boy. I don't wanna get lost in this place. Alright, folks. Step up and see our show. We have girls, girls and girls! Now that you've had your fortune told... what do you say we go over there, go inside and look at the girls, huh? I'd rather not, Jerry. Let's go to the funhouse instead. Come on, Angel. Let's just stick around a little while, huh? - Yeah, that's a good idea, Angie. - Alright. Just for a few minutes. Ortega! Tell my sister, Carmelita, that the time is coming! Stella, step forward and give the folks a little sample. That's it. Take it easy. We have twenty beautiful girls and only ten beautiful costumes. I wanna give you a glimpse of our star, that exotic gypsy dancer, Carmelita! This is Carmelita. The one and only. Just look at those dark, dreamy eyes, those lips and that body. What a body! It's covered out here but on the inside you will see that body au naturel. Doing her original, exotic dance as only she can do it. Don't miss her! Come inside and see the one and only woman of mystery. That's just a glimpse of our big attraction we have on inside. We have twenty beautiful big acts in one continuous show. Now, step right up, get your tickets and enjoy yourself! Come on, Jerry. Let's go. You know, I think I'd like to go inside and see the show, Angel. Well, I don't! I thought we agreed that what I say, goes! It's not that, Jerry. I didn't like how you were staring at that Carmelita. Come on. Let's go inside. It'll be fun. - No! "No"? What do you mean, "No"? - If you go in, you go in without me! What are you trying to do? Force me to choose between you and that girly show? It's not the show you're interested in. It's that stripper! Look, I'm going to go in there with or without you. So, make up your mind! Okay! Go without me! You're gonna let her go? I don't like anyone tellin' me what I have to do. Harold, why don't you be a buddy, take the car and see that she gets home okay? - She'll cool off tomorrow. - Okay, Jerry. That suits me fine. See you later! Hey, Stella! How about a date tomorrow night? - Okay. Should be fun. How does 7 o'clock sound? - Great! Where are we going? Oh, I thought we could spend a quiet, little evening at your place. I could bring up a couple of steaks and you could broil 'em. That's your idea of a big evening? I should slave over a hot stove cooking dinner for you? Why not? Who is going to wash the dishes? - Oh, I'll wash the dishes. It only hurts when I kiss... Kiss someone new. Someone that's not you. It hurts when I embrace his smile Because I know all the while It's not you. I was pretending That our ending was just one of those things. Now I'm laughing through all the tears that losing you brings. It only hurts When I touch... touch someone new. Someone that's not you. It hurts because the touch is cold Until the one I hold is you. The pain gets worse and it just plain hurts. Now we'll give you our exotic, beautiful gypsy dancer, Carmelita! Take it off! Hey, is Carmelita here? - What are you doing here? - Get out! - The nerve of some people! - It's a peep show he wants. He thought he could probably get some real, fast action before the show! Carmelita? I am here. Your note said you wanted to see me. Yes... follow me. Jerry You feel yourself slipping into a deeper sleep. It is as if you were in your own bed. Surrounded by warm covers. Nothing will bother you. Nothing will waken you. You will hear only my voice. See only that which I choose to show you. Open your eyes, Jerry. Look at the wheel! Look at the beautiful, spinning wheel. See how it spins? See how the light travels from the wheel... to the center... to the edges... and back again... It is a deep, spinning hole... You feel yourself falling... Falling into that hole... Deeper... deeper... Deeper into the spinning hole... You will hear my command... and obey! When you awake you will have no memory, no knowledge of the fact you were here. You will do only that which I have commanded you to do! I don't have to do this for a living. My father and mother have an iron and steel company. You've heard it before? My mother irons and my father steals. And now The Hungry Mouth... takes great pride and pleasure in introducing a young, new singer. Let's have a big hand for Mr Don Snyder! How do I stand with your heart? Tell me, please, so I can know I'm walking blind through this wonderland Just because I love you so I have to know how you feel I can't living like this My heart's aflame and I can't really tell The meaning in your tender kiss Tell me, darling Speak straight from your heart If you love me A beautiful romance will start What's wrong, Marge? That fight you had with the manager still getting you down? It's not that. It's something that happened on the midway tonight. - What do you mean? Tell me, my darling, how you really feel We're on. I'll tell you after the show. How do I stand with your heart? Thank you very much. And now we take pride in presenting our main attraction The very talented Miss Marge Neilson and Mr Bill Ward Let's have a big round of applause Obey! You must obey! You must do as Madame Estrella says! - Obey! Kill! - You must kill! Kill! - You must obey! Kill! Jerry! Jerry Over here, Jerry! Over here! I can help you, Jerry. Only I can help you. [inaudible]...no! Help! Help! Hey! It's about time you got up. Boy, I had a restless night last night. I know. I heard you talking to yourself last night while you were sleeping. It was just about the craziest dream I've ever had. It must have been about that crazy chick, Carmelita, huh? Come on, Jerry. Tell me, what happened last night. I don't know. I just can't seem to quite figure out exactly what did happen. I don't even remember coming home last night. Sometimes, when I get a load on, I can't remember things like that either. I wasn't drinking. - Oh, sure. Sure. Say, how about you and Angela. Everything okay? She made me take her right home. Here's your keys. Thanks. Was she mad? Not as mad as her mother. Who cares about her mother. I kind of like her myself. Maybe so. Look, I gotta go. - I'll go with you. I wouldn't be able to get this piece of junk running anyhow. No, you stay here. Don't leave town... Say, Madison. Where's Angie? - She's over there by the pool. - Thanks. So, you finally decided to drop by? Angie, I'd like to explain about last night. It's okay. I understand. I can tell by your voice, you're still mad at me. Why shouldn't I be after the way you acted? - You know...? I'm a little confused about that too. I can't understand what you saw in her. Look. Can't we change the subject? - Alright. But I sure would like to know what happened after I left. We interrupt this program to bring you a special announcement.

Something happens, it happens. Here today, gone tomorrow. Just out of curiosity, what did you predict the future held for her? Nothing... because she wasn't here last night!

I'm not sure what happened last night behind these curtains. But I think you know. - Do I? It's like I've been having a nightmare! After this afternoon with Angela, I'm beginning to believe it. Have you been drinking? - No, I haven't been drinking. Everything's been kinda mixed up but... After hearing that news broadcast a while ago... I'm beginning to think things are a little different. Try new things. Last night I killed a girl and I think you know why! So, tell me. What happened last night behind those curtains? If you really must know what happened behind those curtains... why don't you go behind them? - I think I will. Come on in, Harold. I got here as soon as I could. I had to ride the bus. My car wouldn't start! Harold, we've just got to find him and help him! I still think you should call the police instead of trying to find him yourself. But he's my roommate! I know the guy! I know he's not like that! Would you please give us a chance? Don't call the police, okay? You're right, Mother, but let's wait awhile. Harold, on the phone you said he was upset. Upset about what? I thought he was upset about last night. I didn't realize he was on the verge of going psycho! He acted as if he was going out of his mind. Sort of dazed... If he's in a daze, wandering around the streets, then we've got to get to him before the police pick him up! Do you have any idea where he might have gone? Do you think he could have gone back to that carnival and that girl Carmelita? That sounds like something he'd do. We've got to get to him before the police pick him up! Please give us a chance. Alright, Angela. You can go. As long as Madison goes with you. But if you're not back in the next two hours, I'm calling the police! Okay, then! Let's go! Stella. Stella! Stella? Welcome, my little pet. You have done so very well. This time, I think you ought to get your reward. Ortega! Bring me the acid! It is too bad that remembered so much!
