And I need you to entertain him for me. - What do you mean? - Make him feel good. - (scoffs) What do you want me to do, cook him dinner? - Well, I give you a place to stay, food to eat, nice clothes. It's about cooking my friend dinner. What are you, stupid or something? - Fuck you. - You are a pretty girl, and if you wanna stay pretty, you'll do as I say. Understand? - Yeah. - Hi, what's happening? - Hey, James. - Long time. - All right, meet Sonia.

Sitting there, listening to your music as if everything is still fine. I can't have this disappointment. I like nice restaurants, fancy cars, nice clothes. What, you're probably getting too much for you to handle? - I don't have a problem. - You don't have a problem? Well, you want me to play daddy? I know about your daddy. Your daddy was nice. Huh? Well, I can be twice as nice. Understand? (ominous music) (man grunting) - You see, there was this guy who had two sons. He asked the first to work in his fields. The first one said, "No," but later repented and went. Then he asked the second one to work in his fields, and the second one said, "Yeah, sure," and went out with his friends instead. Which one did what his father wanted? (eerie music) (indistinct chattering) - What am I supposed to do with this bitch? Huh? I mean, this is, you know, this isn't, this is fucking kid's play and shit. I mean, this is a business, you know? I mean, he brings you down, he's getting money, you're getting money, and I'm making money if this makes money. If I don't make money, I don't get no fucking money out of this. Look, you... Listen, would you just fucking listen to me? I'm sick of this fucking shit! Look at my, look at my fucking eyes. Hey, Hey, look to my fucking eyes! You know what I'm saying? I don't want any more shit! (intense music) (distorted voices) - Which one did what his father wanted? But first they told him, and Jesus said, "I tell you, the whores and tax collectors will get to Heaven before you, because John came to you and you didn't believe him, but the whores and tax collectors did, and you, even when you saw it, didn't believe it." (haunting music) (film reel clattering) (film reel clattering) (haunting music) (eerie music) - [Reporter] The district attorney today announced that... (creepy upbeat music) - Oh, you saw the video. You like the little teeny-bopper, huh? I have another one just like that. A little short, though, but nice legs. (classical piano music) (traffic whirring) (birds chirping) (classical piano music) You're going to do what she says now. This is your new home. Hmm, take care. (classical piano music continues) (door closes) (indistinct whispering) (heels tapping) (Sonia chuckles) - This is a business. You are the product. This is the packaging. And the consumer who pays very handsomely is entitled to have his every fantasy and desire fulfilled. Is that clear? Sit down, please. (classical piano music continues) Really? Is that a way for a lady to sit? I realize that the girls of your generation have not had the proper schooling. You don't have the social graces, but at least try to have some pride in your bearing. Sit up, put your ankles and your knees together. There, you look like something. (both chuckle) This is not a joke. And if you continue to treat it as such, you will find your ass is out of the street. This is a special business with special rules. No drugs, no alcohol, no boyfriends, no girlfriends. And you know what I mean. No Johns outside these walls. No film or video appearances. No unsafe sex. No chewing gum. And no foul language. If you obey, you'll be well-rewarded. If not, you'll be back to $20 backseat blowjobs. Is that clear? (men groaning) (classical piano music) (intense music) (heart beating) (dog barking) (suspenseful music) (man grunting) (dog barking) (woman groaning) (man groaning) (knocking on door) (footsteps shuffling) (knocking on door) (intense music) (distorted yelling) (footsteps shuffling) (plastic crinkling) Terrible. (suspenseful music) Bring her around the backstairs and keep quiet. (door thumping) (lock clicks) (intense percussive music) (distorted voices) - [Man] Where'd they go? (intense percussive music) (crowd chattering) (dramatic bagpipe music) (indistinct chattering) (birds chirping) (indistinct chattering) - Whichever tie you want. (indistinct) Five dollars, whichever tie you want. How are ya, hon? Here you go. Any tie you want. Hey, what's, what's going on here? Come on. Hey, hey. Lady, hey, come on, come on. Get out of there, will ya? Come on, come out of there. (sirens wailing) Come with me. I can help ya. Stay right there. Stay right there. Come on, let's go, let's go. (keys jangling) (traffic whirring) (birds chirping) Hi. - Hi. - What's your name? - Sonia. - Oh, that's a very pretty name. Are you hungry? You are hungry? - Yeah. - Oh, good, good. I'm gonna go outside and I'm gonna get you some food. All right then? And I'll come right back. All right? Just, bye-bye. (door opens and closes) (birds chirping) (dramatic opera music) (horn honking) (traffic whirring) (dramatic opera music) (birds chirping) (items rustling) (door opens) Look what I got for you over here. Good food over here. What is this here? This here, like this here. What are you doing? - What? - What? This has never been like this. I'm surprised at you. - What? - How come? - I didn't- - I brought you up here for one week? What is this here you got? - Stop it. - My wife's watch! - I was just looking at it. - This, on your wrist? - Yeah! I just wanted to see if it would fit. - This is, this, I brought you up here for one reason. I brought you up here to feed you. That's it. - Oh, fuck you. - And to be nice, now would- - Fuck you! You brought me up here to fuck me! Leave me alone. - No, don't say that. Don't say that. What is this? And why do you even have to be... This is money over, this don't mean nothing. It doesn't mean, the main thing is feelings within the- - Oh, shut up! You just want, oh, listen. All right? I'll give you what you want. You can fuck me and I'll leave. Okay? Just give me the money and then I'll get what I need. Okay? - No, God. - Okay? - Don't say that. Look. I had the best in the world over here for 28 marvelous years. - Oh, give me a break. - I'm not worried about anybody else. I just wanna be nice to you. That's all. - Oh, you wanna fuck me. - The hell- - Leave me alone. Just give me the money, take what you want, and I'll go, okay? - What is this, "take what you want?" Just to feed you. I know, are you hungry? - Oh, shut up, - Do you feel ill? - Shut up. Shut up. Just shut up! - Please, please. Come back. I didn't mean what I said, please. Oh, I got food for us also. We can be good friends. Just friends. That's all. - I'm, I'm sorry. - Good. I'm glad, I'm glad. Ah, good, good. Uh, we all do, you know how it is, everybody... Thank you so much. Thank you so much for coming back. We can sit down. We can talk. You can tell me all different things about your family, my family. What about your family? - (sighs) Leave me alone. Please, don't, just don't talk about it, okay? - You know, a nice girl like you probably has a family. - Please don't talk about it. - All right. I'm sorry, but let's have supper together. All right? Good. I'm glad, I'm glad. Whatever we do in this world, believe me, for good, no matter what, no matter what happens, we get good out of it. We grow. - Oh, I, no. I don't think so. - You can't believe, no, you can't you believe that? Why not? Why can't you believe that? - Because it's not true. - Did I take you up here? To give you a meal? - (sighs) Yeah, but the world, the world - To be friendly with you? - is not like that. It's not like that. All right? - We're not saying that the world is like that, but people should be more like that. - Well, they're not. Okay? So let's just- - Let's just not talk about it, all right? - So because- - Look, listen, let's just not talk about it, all right? (ominous music) - Can I say a few words to you in reference to not just, not to get you excited... - No, please don't. You're just...(sighs) - What are you trying to tell me? Young lady, you're a nice person. I brought you up here just to give you food and be friendly with you. - Listen, all right? Just leave me alone. I'm a bad person. All right? - You got family? - I've done a lot of bad things. Just shut up about my family. Just shut up! I'm a bad person, yeah. Yeah. - What did you... - Yeah, uh, all right? I'm, I'm a whore, all right? - You're a whore? - Whoo, yeah! - Okay, so? - Ooh, boy! - There's, in the Bible, we had whores. But because of that, they became beautiful people. - Oh, yeah. - They became, why not? - (scoffs) Yeah. - Why can't a beauti, why can't a person who's done bad come out to be good in this world? - It doesn't work out that way 'cause people suck. - You shouldn't talk like that. No, you should- - Well that's the way it is, all right? - What is the way it is? (Sonja sighs) Because you talk that way? - You don't even know what you're talking about. - As long as you have a balance - Right. - with good and bad. - Well there is no balance, all right? - Oh, there is a balance. (Sonia sighs) Yes, there's a balance. Oh, no, oh, no, don't feel that way. Please, believe me. - It's not...(sighs) - I brought your here to feed you and help you over here. I'll sleep on the floor. - Would you just be quiet? - I just wanna nice. That's all. - Yeah. - There are people in this world that are good. It's happened with me. If this happened with me, why can't it happen with you as well? - Do you ever stop talking? - They call me motormouth on the job 'cause I talk all the time. So somebody has to. - Well... I really, I'm really, really tired, and I really wish you'd stop talking. - Let's eat our food here and then you'll go to sleep. All right? - Okay. - Good girl. I'm glad. (intense music) (Sonia breathes uneasily) (Sonia coughing) Friend? Friend? Are you all right? - Oh, what does it look like? - What does what look like? Did you have a good sleep? - No. - Well, why? Was the bed okay? (Sonia breathes uneasily and coughs) What's the matter? - I'm coming off. - Coming off? What do you mean, you're coming off? - I'm coming off drugs. - You're coming off drugs? Oh, no, not a nice girl like you. But we can beat it together. Yes we can. We can beat it together. - I'm gonna die. - No, no, don't say that. I'll call your family. - No, fuck off. (Sonia breathes uneasily) I'm sorry. (haunting rock music) (dog barking) (intense music) - And the cops came by and they took all my stuff. What am I gonna do? I'll talk to you later. Goodbye. (horns honking) (Sonia sighing) (dramatic opera music) (soft organ music) (dramatic opera music) (gun firing) (dramatic opera music continues) (ethereal organ music)
