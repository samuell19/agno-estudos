(all laughing) - Allie, how long are you here for? - [Allie] Uh, one more week. - Oh, well, get out before you start decaying. - No one is decaying, don't listen to him. - Uh, close your eyes. - Close my eyes? - Close your ears. Get out now! - [Allie] Come on, it's not that bad. - Listen, Grinnell, Iowa is about as specific as this ketchup, and if you don't leave now, you're gonna end up just like this bottle, uninteresting, alone, and always half empty. - Well, then why are you still here annoying everyone? - I don't know, your boyfriend was busy, so I wasn't able to go out with him. - Busy with me. - Oh, well, that was-- - We were Skyping. We had a Skype date. - None of you are dating anyone. (Sumana laughs) (door slams) - Hey. - Hey. - Where'd you go? - No where. - Jon is so ridiculous. Tonight was too big a dose. - [Joni] How much is your rent? - [Allie] Hmm? - In New York, how much will your rent be? - [Allie] I don't know, a lot. - Bet it's like five times what you'd pay here for a quarter the space. - [Allie] Yeah, probably. - Of course, you're not paying for the space, right? You're paying for the location, all the shops and the restaurants and - What's wrong? - (sighs) Just probably won't have time to come home. Wheres the remote? - Joni, I'll come visit. - Like you did in college. - I was working, I was in shows, I, I was building my career. - What career exactly are you talking about? You got one tiny supporting role like a thousand other girls that are now waiting tables in Manhattan. - As opposed to waiting tables in Grinnell, Iowa? At least I'm trying to do something and - Hey, I don't blame you. Mom's dead, your friends are assholes, and God-forbid, you end up like Jaysen or like me, stuck in a dead place without a trace of fucking culture. - [Allie] This isn't about Jaysen, okay? Nobody's forcing you to stay here. If you don't wanna be here, you can leave. - It never occurs to anyone that maybe I like it here? Maybe I consider this home? - [Allie] Do you? - Maybe. - Okay, then that's great. That's just fucking fantastic, but I'm not like you, okay? I can't have a singing career in the middle of a fucking cornfield. I'm not okay with just waking up and going to Saints Rest and then going to Lonnski's and then going home, and then that's it for the rest of my life. I don't want that. - [Joni] Do you hear yourself? - [Allie] I wish you'd just say what your fucking issue is. - My fucking issue is that you don't even care that we're only gonna see each other maybe 20 more times for the rest of our lives. - That's ridiculous. I'm a three-hour flight away. I can come home multiple times a year. - [Joni] Fantastic! I used to have a sister every day. I didn't realize it was a childhood fad. - [Allie] It's not a fad, but you can't keep everybody static around you, okay? Even Danny's gonna leave eventually. - Oh okay, whatever. - [Allie] No, she told me. Andrew proposed, but she's too afraid to tell you because you're such a fucking psycho about people leaving. Where are you going? - Apparently, nowhere. Have fun singing Moon River to a bunch of rich white people nine times a week.

You won't be able to stay mad at her, will you? - You know I keep a death grip on grudges. - She's just a short plane ride away. It's not like you need to fly 15 hours to go see her. - Anyway, it'll all pass. - What? - This whole Broadway thing, it's not gonna last. - It's not? - Not like me, not forever. I'm the motherfucking diamond. - Come on, it's not Broadway. It's only open mic night, let's go. - Okay, one minute. - Go ask Joni if she wants to come. - Hey. Uh, Danny's taking me out since it's my last night and all. It'd be great if you could join us, if you're not too tired. - Yeah, fine. - And just so I don't forget. Finally get your car back. - [Danny] We went to the mall. (Allie and Danny speaking faintly) - That's impressive, that's like a lot. - Cool. (Joni laughing) Hey, Joni. - Scott. - It's been a while, right? - I thought you were in the city. - I was, I moved back a couple weeks ago, been layin' low. - You didn't like Chicago? - Nah, it's not really my speed. - Yeah. Well, sorry it didn't work out. - Nah, it's cool. It's been good to see some familiar faces around, ya know? - Yeah. - Joni! Hold on, I got you guys. Here, take one. All right, all right, all right. To my favorite threesome. - Cheers. (Allie laughs) (patrons chattering) - [Michael] Mm! (Michael groans) - I'm gonna miss you, Michael. - What do you mean? - I mean I'm gonna miss you when I leave. - You're leaving? - Yeah, like tomorrow. - What? (Danny laughs) When did this happen? Are you kidding me, Joni? - You didn't know that? She got a gig on Broadway, stupid. - So, you're leavin'? Whoa, that changes everything. Kevin, can I get four more. (Danny laughs) - Hey, guys. - Yo, baby. - Hey. - [Danny] Let's grab a table. - I'm so jealous you get to work with Michael every day. I'm really gonna miss it here. - I get it, Allie, it's fine. - So, this is only to keep me from leaving next year. - No. - [Danny] But only if I stay. - Well, you came to the States because you wanted to, right? - Sure, I mean, for college, for med school, but I was always gonna go back home eventually. - Can't I be your home? (speaking in Hebrew) What? - That's my point. (crowd cheering) - All right, thank you, Raven, for that lovely performance. Up next, we have? - Allie. - Allie. (crowd cheering) - Thank you.

(laughing) - Ow. - Good god, I have to pee. - I'm seriously too old for this shit. (Joni and Danny sighing) Oh, this is nice. - Oh my god. - You know you can talk to me, right? I don't have to hear things from Allie. - It just didn't feel like something you'd wanna hear. - [Joni] I don't, but I will. What are you gonna do? - I feel like I need to go home. - Okay. - [Danny] What will you do? - I'm gonna die of hunger in that corner over there.
