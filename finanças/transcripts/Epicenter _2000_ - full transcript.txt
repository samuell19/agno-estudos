HE'S BEEN LIKE A BLOODY ROBOT SINCE HIS WIFE PASSED AWAY. THIS IS UNIT ONE. WE'RE ALL CLEAR HERE. ( sighs ) PAYBACK TIME. ( bell rings ) THERE YOU ARE. GOOD MORNING. NICE MAKEUP JOB. THANK YOU, ROBIN. YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'RE GETTING READY TO GO TO THE MISS TRAILER PARK PAGEANT. NOW, NOW, NOW, I DON'T MAKE FUN OF THE WAY YOU DRESS. BESIDES, IT'S WAY TOO EARLY FOR RIDICULE. - EARLY? - WELL, IT'S EARLY FOR ME. I DIDN'T GET HOME UNTIL THE CRACK OF DAWN. WAIT A SECOND, HOW COME YOU'RE NOT AT SCHOOL? SPRING BREAK? OH, RIGHT. THAT STARTS TODAY, DOESN'T IT? YEAH. SO DOES GYMNASTICS. I KNEW THAT. THEN I SUPPOSE YOU ALSO KNOW THAT YOU PROMISED ME A RIDE. ( rumbling ) NOT AGAIN. IT'S ONLY A TREMOR, MOM. THERE'S BEEN TWO OTHER ONES THIS MORNING. I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU WERE GOING TO QUIT. I DID. FOR A WHILE. ANOTHER BROKEN PROMISE. HAND THEM OVER. LISTEN, I CAN'T GIVE YOU A RIDE THIS MORNING, I KNOW I PROMISED, BUT I CAN'T. OH, SURPRISE, SURPRISE. Now the common misconception is that these plates move in opposite directions, but it's more accurate to say that there is a constant and building tension between these plates, they're always pushing against each other. So, what happened this morning was that we had a release of that tension. What does that mean in terms of what we can expect as far as tremors or even earthquakes are concerned? Well, Sarah, a number of tremors is actually a good thing. It's a small release of tension over a period of time, as opposed to a major earthquake. HOW ABOUT ONE OF THE OTHER MOTHERS GIVES YOU A RIDE? ONE OF THE OTHER MOTHERS IS ALWAYS GIVING ME A LIFT. IT'S EMBARRASSING. WAIT A MINUTE. ROBIN, I KNOW THINGS HAVE BEEN TOUGH ON YOU, BUT IT'S ALL GOING TO BE OVER SOON. YOU'VE BEEN SAYING "SOON" ALL YEAR. THAT'S WHY DAD MOVED TO LOS ANGELES. I'VE HEARD ENOUGH. I HATE THIS CAR. I SAID THAT'S ENOUGH. IT'S PART OF MY UNDERCOVER CHARACTER. IT'S MY JOB. I'M SORRY I CAN'T BE LIKE ALL THOSE OTHER MOTHERS. I DON'T WANT YOU TO BE LIKE THOSE OTHER MOMS. I JUST WANT YOU TO BE MY MOM. HELLO, MRS. BOWER? HI, IT'S AMANDA. AMANDA... AMANDA FOSTER, ROBIN'S MOTHER. YEAH. I'M IN A BIT OF A BIND. I'M WONDERING IF YOU COULD DO ME A REALLY BIG FAVOR. ( dance music plays ) I THOUGHT YOU QUIT, ROXIE. JUST SHUT UP AND GIVE ME THE PACK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ( chuckles ) NICE TRY. ( Russian accent ) YOU'RE LATE. DMITRI HAS BEEN WAITING FOR OUR CALL. DMITRI? IT'S GOING DOWN NOW? UH-HUH. IVAN, OUR COMPUTER SPECIALIST, IS HERE. GIVE HER THE ADDRESS. MY BROTHER, IVAN-- HE LOVES AMERICA. VERY SOPHISTICATED, VERY SMOOTH. HE WANTS TO BE ROCK HUDSON. YOU KNOW, "PILLOW TALK"? ROCK HUDSON. ( speaking Russian ) VERY BIG. OH, MY BROTHER. I TELL IVAN, ROCK HAD MORE BALLS ON HIS CHIN THAN AMERICAN BASEBALL CATCHER. THIS I DO NOT BELIEVE. IVAN. HE'S CLEAN. DO YOU HAVE THE DISK? YEAH. HAVE A SEAT. HAVE YOU MADE THE CONNECTION? YES. ( beeps ) ( phone rings ) Hello, Dmitri. Hello? - GOOD DAY, TANYA. - Good day. Everything's ready for transmission. I'M VERY GLAD. PLEASE CONTINUE. Give me one moment and I will send it. Dmitri: Whenever you are ready. SEND IT THROUGH. YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. ( beeps ) UH-HUH. WHAT IS THIS? YOU TRYING TO FUNNY? WHAT IS GOING ON? YOU SAID-- WHAT I SAID WAS THAT I'D GIVE YOU GLOBAL TECH'S NEW STEALTH TRACKING SYSTEM FOR $15 MILLION. AND THAT'S WHAT YOU GOT. YOU HAVE THE SCHEMATICS, YOU JUST CAN'T SEE THEM. Dmitri: I do not see any tracking system, I see... ...bunnies! EASTER BUNNIES. THAT'S GLOBAL TECH'S ENCRYPTION SYSTEM. THAT'S PRETTY COOL, HUH? IT CHANGES WITH EVERY SEASON. YOU'LL NEED A MICROCHIP TO DECIPHER WHAT I JUST GAVE YOU. Where is this chip? SOMEWHERE SAFE. YOU'LL HAVE IT, AS SOON AS I GET MY 15 MILLION. THE DEAL IS, I GIVE YOU FIVE NOW, THE OTHER 10 WHEN I SEE THE INFORMATION IS GOOD. THE ABILITY TO TRACK A STEALTH AIRCRAFT ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD, IS WORTH A DAMNED SIGHT MORE THAN $15 MILLION. I COULD PROBABLY FIND A NATION THAT WILL PAY 100 MILLION OR MORE. MY GUESS IS YOU GUYS ALREADY HAVE. NOW, ALL I WANT IS MY TIDY LITTLE PROFIT. BUT, MAKE NO MISTAKE, I WANT IT ALL, AND I WANT IT NOW. PEOPLE DO NOT ALTER DEALS WITH ME, MR. CONSTANTINE. GLOBAL TECH HAS SPENT FIVE YEARS AND ALL ITS MONEY ON THIS PROJECT. THEY ARE GOING TO BE CRUSHED. They, nor US intelligence are going to take this lying down. They're going to be sniffing me up all over the globe, But hey... I DON'T MIND THE LIFE ON THE RUN, BUT NOT WITHOUT MY PAY CHECK. I WANT $15 MILLION IN MY SWISS ACCOUNT, RIGHT NOW. IVAN? I WANT THE CHIP, NOW. Tanya... WE WILL HONOR Mr. Constantine's request. I will transfer the money now. ACCOUNT NUMBER AND PASSWORD? ACCOUNT NUMBER 4 3 6 2 1 4 3, BRAVO ALPHA ROMEO. ROTHWELL BANK, ZURICH. PASSWORD? EXCUSE ME. ( clicking ) COME ON, SPIT HER UP. OKAY. THE CHIP. IT'S NOT THAT EASY. I'LL RING YOU FIVE MINUTES AFTER I LEAVE THE BUILDING. 15 MILLION IS NOT GOING TO DO ME A LOT OF GOOD WITH A BULLET IN MY HEAD. Mr. Constantine... if by chance... WE DO NOT RECEIVE THAT MICROCHIP... there will be no excuses. If you are mugged on your way out, if you get hit by a cable car, if you are attacked and torn to pieces by a pack of wild dogs, it will not matter. I can assure you that everyone sharing your last name shall suffer the most extreme retribution. FIVE MINUTES. YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. FIVE MINUTES. CIAO, EVERYBODY. ( cable car bell rings ) ( rings ) WHERE IS IT? IT'S IN A PHONE BOOTH AT THE CORNER OF HICKORY AND-- FREEZE. FBI. WHERE'S ROXIE? Keep your hands where I can see them. ROXIE'S FBI. YOU'RE UNDER ARREST FOR ESPIONAGE. HICKORY AND RIVIERA. - THEY'RE ON THE CORNER. - MOVE! THE PHONE BOOTH, HICKORY AND RIVIERA. GO. - SHIT. - DAMN IT. THERE'S THE CAR. PULL IT OVER. STOP THIS VEHICLE IMMEDIATELY. - YOU'RE UNDER ARREST. - OH, BEHAVE. PULL IT OVER, NOW. WHAT A CLASSIC PIECE OF AMERICANA, THE '68 CADILLAC CONVERTIBLE. - COME ON. - COME ON? FASTER! FASTER! GOD DAMN! I'M A FEDERAL AGENT. PULL OVER THIS TRUCK, NOW. PLEASE, LADY, I'M TRYING TO FOCUS. THIS ISN'T EASY, YOU KNOW. PULL IT OVER. THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE. LOOK, IF I STOP THIS CAR, THEY'RE GOING TO SHOOT ME AND YOU, SO JUST SIT TIGHT AND ENJOY THE RIDE. - HERE WE GO! - OH, NO! YOU BOTTOM OUT! I LOVE AMERICA! SHIT! GO! DRIVE! I'M DRIVING. GO! LET'S GO! FOREIGNERS, MOVE OUT OF THE WAY! CLEAR THE GODDAMNED ROAD! - ( screams ) - SHIT. Ivan: THERE SHE IS. HAVE A SEAT. - HURRY UP! - GO TO HELL. COME ON. LET ME DRIVE! - YOU WANT TO DRIVE? - LET ME DRIVE! COME ON! - YOU WANT TO FUCKING DRIVE? - YEAH! YOU CAN DRIVE, MOTHERFUCKER. THIS AIN'T NO FUCKING YUGO. PUT THE PEDAL TO THE METAL, MOTHERFUCKER. ( screams ) WHAT'S GOING ON? EVERYBODY JUST STAY CALM. YOU'RE CRAZY, MAN. YOU'RE CRAZY! COME ON. HOLY SHIT. ( screaming ) YOU BETTER NOT SLOW DOWN, YOU LITTLE SLUT! ( gunshots ) OKAY, MUCH BETTER NOW. Ivan: I HAVE YOU NOW, ROXIE! ( hollering ) SHIT, POLICE! LET'S GO! MOVE YOUR ASS! - POLICE! DROP YOUR WEAPONS! - DO IT, RIGHT NOW. JESUS! THE BUREAU APPRECIATES YOUR COOPERATION. WHATEVER WE CAN DO TO HELP. OBVIOUSLY, IT'S A HUGE EFFECT ON THE FUTURE OF GLOBAL TECH. WE HAVE TO FIND THIS CHIP. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, GOOD AFTERNOON. THANK YOU FOR COMING. THE RAID THIS MORNING UNFORTUNATELY TURNED UP NOTHING. THE STRIP BAR WAS CLEARED BARE, NOT EVEN PRINTS. IT WOULD APPEAR THEY HAD A CLEANING TEAM. NOW, WE HAVE MEN STATIONED AT THE AIRPORT. THESE GUYS AREN'T STUPID. IT'S VERY POSSIBLE THEY'LL SLIP ACROSS THE BORDER INTO CANADA, AND FROM THERE, WHO KNOWS. NO... THEY'RE STILL HERE. THEY WOULDN'T LEAVE WITHOUT THE CHIP, WHERE IT GOES, THEY'LL FOLLOW. NICK CONSTANTINE IS THE ONLY ONE THAT KNOWS WHERE IT IS. I GET IT FROM HIM, THEY COME TO ME. MY BOYS HAVE TRIED EVERYTHING TO GET IT OUT OF HIM, AMANDA, AND HE DOESN'T GIVE A DAMN. EXCUSE ME. CAN WE HAVE FIVE MINUTES PLEASE? THANK YOU. MAYBE L.A. WILL HAVE BETTER LUCK WITH HIM. L.A.? HE FLIES OUT IN AN HOUR. WHAT'S GOING ON HERE, TED? I'M NOT SURE. I'VE BEEN DEEP COVER FOR A YEAR. I DESERVE TO KNOW. WORD IS THERE'S A BREACH OF SECURITY. I'M TOLD OUR SAFE HOUSES HAVE BEEN COMPROMISED. SAN FRANCISCO IS NO LONGER A SAFE PLACE TO HOLD HIM. A BREACH HERE IN FBI? YEAH. IT'S REAL HUSH-HUSH. ORDERS ARE TO BRING HIM TO A SAFE HOUSE IN L.A., AND THAT'S COMING STRAIGHT FROM THE TOP. SPECIAL AGENT MOORE. AND MOORE HIMSELF IS GOING TO TAKE CUSTODY OF CONSTANTINE IN L.A. THEY'VE GOT A NEW SAFE HOUSE THERE. THEY WANT TO GET HIM THE HELL OUT OF THIS CITY, MOORE'S ORDERS. I'LL ESCORT CONSTANTINE THERE. NO, NO. IT'S ALL BEEN SETTLED, AMANDA. I'M SORRY. YOU SHOULDN'T BE SMOKING IN HERE. YOU'RE SORRY? I SHOULDN'T BE SMOK-- I'VE BEEN UNDERCOVER FOR A YEAR! MY MARRIAGE IS A DISASTER, MY DAUGHTER THINKS THAT I'VE ABANDONED HER, AND THE MOMENT THIS CASE TAKES A TURN FOR THE WORSE, YOU DUMP ME? THAT'S NOT THE WAY IT IS. YOU'RE NOT BEING DUMPED. THE CASE IS JUST BEING TAKEN OVER FROM ABOVE. THEN LET ME ESCORT HIM THERE. YOU CAN DO THAT FOR ME. IT'S JUST WAY TOO COMPLICATED AT THIS POINT. DON'T TELL ME THAT YOU CAN'T, BECAUSE YOU AND I BOTH KNOW THAT YOU CAN. ALL RIGHT. ROBIN, SWEETIE, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU. HONEY. I WAS THINKING YOU COULD STAY WITH PATTY. ROBIN? - ROBIN. - ( horn honks ) ROBIN, ARE YOU IN HERE? WHERE IS SHE? ( honking continues ) I'M COMING. ( telephone rings ) ( answering machine beeps ) Amanda... IT'S STEVEN. ARE YOU THERE? I know you're there. THERE'S SOMEONE HERE THAT WOULD LIKE TO TALK TO YOU. MOM. ROBIN. ROBIN? WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN LOS ANGELES? I was worried about you. ALL YOU'RE EVER WORRIED ABOUT IS WORK. I decided something. I'M NOT GOING TO LIVE WITH YOU ANYMORE. I'M GOING TO LIVE WITH DAD. YOU WILL DO NO SUCH THING. YOU CAN'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO ANYMORE. LOOK, CAN WE JUST GET TOGETHER AND TALK, PLEASE? YOU AND I, WOMAN TO WOMAN, I KNOW WE CAN SORT THIS WHOLE THING OUT if we could just get together and talk. I'VE HEARD IT ALL BEFORE. LOOK, I KNOW, BUT I MEAN IT THIS TIME. I'M COMING TO LOS ANGELES. Just pick a place, anywhere you like. THERE'S NO POINT. YOU'RE JUST GOING TO FIND SOME EXCUSE NOT TO SHOW. ( sighs ) PLEASE, HONEY? Trust me. 9:00 AT THE BEAN QUEEN. IT'S A COFFEE SHOP IN ANGEL CITY MALL. OKAY. I KNOW WHERE THAT IS. I'LL SEE YOU TONIGHT, OKAY? YEAH, RIGHT. ( horn honks ) ( siren sounds ) WE'LL JUST BE A MINUTE, AGENT FOSTER. BLIMEY... A LEAR JET. NICE TRANSPORTATION. I GUESS IT PAYS BEING A CRIMINAL NOWADAYS. YOU KNOW, MISS FOSTER, YOUR NEW LOOK IS, UH, SIMPLY MARVELOUS. I HAD NO IDEA EARLIER THAT THERE WAS SUCH A STUNNING WOMAN BENEATH THAT OGRE FACADE. IT'S MRS. FOSTER, MR. CONSTANTINE. REALLY? YOU DON'T LOOK LIKE THE MARRYING KIND. AND YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT ME, MR. CONSTANTINE. MAYBE YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THE SERIOUSNESS OF YOUR SITUATION. THERE'S NO WAY OUT. BUT YOU CAN START BY TELLING ME WHERE THE MICROCHIP IS. NOW WHY WOULD I DO THAT? WHY DON'T YOU TRY ENTERING YOUR PASSWORD? WHY? SO YOU'LL BELIEVE ME WHEN I TELL YOU THAT I'VE CHANGED IT. YOU GIVE ME THE CHIP, I GIVE YOU THE PASSWORD. YOU DO UNDERSTAND, AGENT FOSTER, THAT GIVING YOU THAT CHIP IS TANTAMOUNT TO SWALLOWING A CYANIDE CAPSULE. THE ONLY REASON THAT I'M STILL ALIVE, IS BECAUSE I HAVE SOMETHING THAT DMITRI WANTS. THAT CHIP IS MY LIFE INSURANCE. AND BESIDES... YOU DON'T PLAY NICE. ( telephone rings ) GET OUT OF HERE. YEAH. TANYA, I'M VERY DISAPPOINTED. I'M OUT $15 MILLION. MY BROTHER IS DEAD. I'm sorry. BOTH OUR LOSSES ARE HEAVY. THAT BITCH IS GOING TO DIE FOR THIS. I COULD NOT AGREE MORE, BUT YOU MUST STAY FOCUSED. EVERYTHING'S TAKEN CARE OF. MY CONTACT JUST INFORMED ME THAT CONSTANTINE IS LEAVING FOR LOS ANGELES TONIGHT. AMANDA IS HIS ESCORT. Two birds with one stone. VERY GOOD. READY THE PLANE. WE'RE GOING TO LOS ANGELES. This is Leslie Michaels on KTSL News Radio where you get traffic and weather updates every 15 minutes. And now here is Nancy Dotson, up in chopper 3 with the latest in traffic. How's the freeways looking, Nancy? THANKS, LESLIE. THINGS ARE MOVING RIGHT ALONG ON MANY MAJOR ROUTES, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF PCH, WHERE A THREE-CAR PILE UP HAS CLOSED TWO LANES, ONE IN EITHER DIRECTION. RIGHT NOW, I'M FLYING OVER DOWNTOWN. SCHOOL'S OUT TODAY, AND TRAFFIC IS LIGHT. NO REPORTS OF ANY MAJOR TIE UPS. AS ALWAYS, WATCH OUT FOR SPEEDTRAPS, AND STAY TUNED TO KTSL, WHERE EVERY 15 MINUTES, TRAFFIC UPDATES ARE COMING TO YOU LIVE FROM YOUR EYE IN THE SKY, ME, NANCY DOTSON. Thanks, Nancy.

UH, ROBIN, TRY TO BE NICE WHEN YOU SEE HER. SHE'S NOT THE ENEMY. SHE LOVES YOU. I DOUBT SHE'LL EVEN SHOW UP. THANKS, DAD. OKAY. SOONER OR LATER, DMITRI IS GOING TO MAKE A MOVE AGAINST YOU. IT'S POSSIBLE THAT MY GUARD MIGHT BE DOWN. A STRAY BULLET COULD MAKE IT THROUGH TO YOU, NICK. AM I MAKING MYSELF PERFECTLY CLEAR? I WANT THAT CHIP. YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT ME. ACTUALLY, I KNOW QUITE A BIT ABOUT YOU. NICHOLAS RYAN CONSTANTINE, AGE 30. MILITARY SYSTEMS DESIGNER FOR GLOBAL TECH. RECRUITED STRAIGHT OUT OF COLLEGE. OUR PROFILE SHOWS YOU TO BE AN UNLIKELY TRAITOR. DO YOU KNOW ABOUT MY WIFE? PATRICIA. IT WAS LEUKEMIA. DO YOU ALSO KNOW THAT SHE WAS MY HIGH SCHOOL SWEETHEART... THAT SHE WAS MY BEST FRIEND? HOW DO YOU THINK YOUR BEST FRIEND WOULD FEEL ABOUT YOU SELLING OUT HER COUNTRY? I'M DOING THIS TO DESTROY MY COMPANY, NOT THIS COUNTRY. ALL THE SAME, THAT'S THE EVENTUALITY. SO BE IT. WHAT DO YOU HAVE AGAINST GLOBAL TECH? ( snorts ) LIKE I SAID... YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT ME. Amanda: THIS ISN'T THE WAY TO THE FEDERAL BUILDING. WHERE ARE WE GOING?

AGENT MOORE? AGENT FOSTER. IT CERTAINLY IS A PLEASURE TO MEET YOU. THIS IS NICK CONSTANTINE. - NICK. - AGENT MOORE. I THOUGHT WE WERE MEETING AT THE FEDERAL BUILDING. BEEN A LITTLE SLIGHT CHANGE IN PLANS. PLEASE HAVE A SEAT. THIS IS US. SEVENTH FLOOR, RIGHT? YEAH, I THINK. ( parrot voice ) HELLO! YOU WANT A DIFFERENT FLOOR? FIFTH FLOOR, PLEASE. THE MORE YOU PUSH THE BUTTON, THE FASTER THE ELEVATOR GOES. A LITTLE TRICK I PICKED UP. L.A. PUBLIC SCHOOLS. OH MY! ( imitating parrot chortling ) WHOO. THINGS SURE HAVE HEATED UP OVER AT THE AGENCY. ABOUT AN HOUR AGO, THEY BUSTED A DOUBLE AGENT WHO WAS WORKING AS A MOLE. I HEARD ABOUT THAT UP IN SAN FRANCISCO. MM. KRNICKI. KRNICKI? YEAH. DOES THAT RING A BELL, NICK? I BELIEVE HE'S THE ONE WHO CLEARED THE ALARM SYSTEM FOR YOU. BOY, YOU GUYS ARE SHARP. I NEVER EVEN MET THE GUY. I'VE NO IDEA WHO HE IS. DMITRI SET IT UP. HMM... WELL, HE SURE AS HELL KNOWS WHO YOU ARE. AS A MATTER OF FACT, HE'S CUTTING A DEAL FOR HIMSELF RIGHT NOW... AT YOUR EXPENSE. THEN I GUESS I'M IN A BIT OF A PICKLE, HUH? YOU SEE, AGENT FOSTER, THAT'S WHY I WANTED TO HAVE OUR LITTLE MEETING HERE. I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND. SEE, NICK, THE AGENCY HAS BEEN KNOWN TO HELP PEOPLE OUT NOW AND THEN. 'COURSE HE'D HAVE TO SHOW US A LITTLE COOPERATION, WOULDN'T YOU SAY? OF COURSE. THE CHIP. THE CHIP? THE CHIP, OF COURSE. WHAT ELSE? WHY DON'T YOU JUST TELL US WHERE IT IS, NICK?

I'M JUST DOING MY JOB. YOU'RE STILL A SPY. YOU'RE NEVER GONNA MAKE IT STICK. YOU HAVE NO HARD EVIDENCE. IT'S ALL CIRCUMSTANTIAL. YOU DON'T HAVE A COPY OF THE STOLEN PLANS, YOU DON'T HAVE THE CHIP. I'M THE ONLY ONE YOU GOT IN CUSTODY. I'M PROBABLY GOING TO WALK AWAY WITH A SLAP ON THE WRIST. THERE'LL STILL BE A HIT OUT ON YOU, NICK. THEY'RE GONNA KILL YOU, TOO. WHERE WE GOING ANYWAY? NORTH. WE'RE HEADING TO THE MALL. I'VE GOT TO FIND MY DAUGHTER ROBIN. GO ON. NOW! WHATEVER. Nancy Dotson: AM I ON? ARE WE HOT? I'M SORRY. LESLIE? I CAN'T HEAR YOU ANYMORE. TO FOLKS LISTENING, THIS IS NANCY DOTSON WITH CONTINUOUS COVERAGE OF THE LARGEST EARTHQUAKE IN LOS ANGELES CITY HISTORY. GAS MAINS HAVE BROKEN EVERYWHERE, AND FROM MY VIEW HERE, THERE ARE MORE FIRES THAN I CAN COUNT. THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES HAS BEEN DECLARED A DISASTER AREA. NATIONAL GUARD IS BEING DEPLOYED, BUT IT WILL TAKE ANYWHERE FROM ONE TO THREE DAYS TO GET IT COMPLETELY MOBILIZED. THE VIEW IS... THIS-- THIS IS MORE THAN... I CAN DESCRIBE. REPORTING LIVE, THIS IS NANCY DOTSON WITH KTSL NEWS RADIO. UNH! AGH! THERE YOU GO, MR. CORSO. COME ON! OKAY. AGH! AAH! BRAD! COME ON. LIFT ME UP. YOU UP? Man: ALL RIGHT, GET A CRANE ON THIS HOUSE. MOVE IT! Second Man: HEY, MAN, COME ON, GET A GRIP ON THAT 2-1/2! MOVE IT DOWN THERE! HE'S GOT TO MOVE! ( coughs ) ( clicking ) ( cell phone rings ) ( ring ) ( ring ) WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I SUGGEST YOU STOP YELLING AT ME, TANYA. AGENT FOSTER'S PHONE. WHO'S SPEAKING? WHERE'S MY WIFE? MR. FOSTER, THIS IS AGENT MOORE. UH, YOUR WIFE IS FINE. THERE'S BEEN A LITTLE CONFUSION DOWN HERE AT THE FEDERAL BUILDING, BUT EVERYONE'S FINE. IS THERE A MESSAGE I CAN GIVE TO HER? UH, YEAH. TELL HER-- TELL HER TO GO TO THE MALL, AND I'LL BE WAITING AT HOME IN CASE ROBIN COMES HERE. ROBIN? OUR DAUGHTER. SHE'S WAITING FOR HER THERE. MAYBE AMANDA'S HEADED THERE ALREADY. AND WHAT MALL WOULD THAT BE, MR. FOSTER? ANGEL CITY MALL. ANGEL CITY MALL. I'LL GIVE HER THE MESSAGE RIGHT AWAY. THANK YOU. WHAT? WE'RE GOING SHOPPING. LET'S GO, BRAD. Corso: WHERE ARE YOU GOING? I GOT TO GET HIM SOME HELP. THERE'S NO ONE TO HELP YOU HERE. I-- I KNOW. MY MOM'S GOING TO MEET ME HERE AT 9:00. SHE'LL KNOW WHAT TO DO. WHAT MAKES YOU THINK SHE'S GONNA SHOW UP? NOTHING. I'M-- I'M JUST HOPING SHE WILL. GOOD LUCK. YOU TOO, DEAR. COME ON. Amanda: WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TO YOU? WHY DO YOU HATE GLOBAL TECH SO MUCH? THEY KILLED MY WIFE. YOUR WIFE DIED OF LEUKEMIA, NICK. THEY LET HER DIE. I'M SORRY. YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO EXPLAIN IT TO ME BECAUSE I JUST DON'T GET IT. I SPENT COUNTLESS HOURS DESIGNING AND CONCEIVING SYSTEMS FOR THEM. I GAVE THEM MY LIFE. YEAH, AND YOU WERE WELL PAID FOR IT. I WORKED MY ASS OFF FOR IT. I EARNED EVERY DAMNED PENNY. I WAS ACTUALLY DOING SOMETHING FOR NATIONAL SECURITY, FOR THIS COUNTRY! FUNNY, I'M IN THE SAME DAMN BUSINESS! YEAH, AND WHEN I NEEDED SOME HELP, THEY WOULDN'T LIFT A FINGER. BILLIONS SPENT TO SAFEGUARD THIS COUNTRY'S WAY OF LIFE, BUT HEY, JUST DON'T GET SICK, 'CAUSE YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN. WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO TELL ME, THAT GLOBAL TECH DIDN'T HAVE A HEALTH PLAN? OH, YEAH, THEY HAD A HEALTH PLAN. IT COVERED EVERYTHING AND ANYTHING. WE TRIED ALL THE TRADITIONAL PROCEDURES, BUT NOTHING WAS WORKING. SO WE OPTED FOR A NEW EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENT. GLOBAL TECH'S MEDICAL, THEY WOULDN'T PAY FOR IT. WE SPENT OUR LIFE SAVINGS SENDING PATRICIA TO ENGLAND FOR TREATMENT. I EVEN MORTGAGED MY HOUSE. I WAS SPENDING SO LITTLE TIME AT WORK, THOSE FUCKING BASTARDS ACTUALLY DEMOTED ME! AND THEN WHEN I ASKED THEM FOR A LITTLE BIT OF FINANCIAL HELP, NO WAY. EVENTUALLY THE MONEY RAN OUT... AND HER TIME RAN OUT. I'M SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS. LAST MONTH THE FDA APPROVED THE TREATMENT. IF WE HAD STARTED IT WHEN SHE WAS DIAGNOSED, THERE WAS A 75% CHANCE SHE WOULD HAVE MADE IT. GLOBAL TECH INVESTED EVERYTHING INTO THIS SYSTEM. ONCE THIS CHIP GETS ONTO THE BLACK MARKET, THE TECHNOLOGY BECOMES OBSOLETE... AND GLOBAL TECH FALLS. TOUCHE. YEAH, TOUCHE. I CAN UNDERSTAND HOW YOU'VE COME TO HATE THEM, NICK, BUT YOU'RE JEOPARDIZING NATIONAL SECURITY. YOU'RE USING A SLEDGEHAMMER TO SQUASH A FLY. IT'S CALLED COLLATERAL DAMAGE, AMANDA. IT'S AN UNFORTUNATE BUT ACCEPTED EVIL IN THE DEFENSE INDUSTRY. LOOK, I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE MONEY. I DON'T EVEN CARE THAT YOU GOT THE PASSWORD. THE FIRST CHANCE I GET, THIS CHIP WILL GET OUT. I'M SORRY, NICK. I CAN'T LET YOU DO THAT. HEY, GIVE ME A HAND HERE. WE GOT PEOPLE THAT ARE STILL ALIVE. STICK IT IN YOUR ASS! Man: HELP... PLEASE... OH, MY GOD. WE'VE GOT TO HELP THEM. HOW DO YOU KNOW I WON'T RUN OFF? I DON'T... BUT I'M TRUSTING YOU. YOU SURE YOU WANT TO DO THAT? I DON'T HAVE A CHOICE. SOMEBODY SECURE THAT TRUCK! THERE'S PEOPLE TRAPPED DOWN HERE! DID YOU HEAR THAT? FBI! PLEASE, EVERYBODY, JUST STEP BACK. THANK YOU. STAY HERE. YOU'VE GOT TO LIFT THEM OUT. COME ON. ( clanking ) HELP ME. COME ON. ( clanking ) AMANDA, MOVE IT! WHAT ARE YOU DOING? YOU CAN'T DO THAT. YOU'LL KILL BOTH OF THEM! SHUT UP! I NEED THEM ALIVE! Nick: COME ON, AMANDA. HURRY! AAH! AAH! OH, GOD! COME ON! YOU SAVED MY LIFE. THANK YOU, NICK. COULDN'T LET ROBIN GO AND GROW UP WITHOUT A MOTHER. LOOK, I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW-- HEY... DON'T GET ALL MUSHY ON ME, OKAY? IT WASN'T ALL THAT NOBLE. I STILL WANT THE PASSWORD. RIGHT. COME ON. JESUS CHRIST. CRIKEY... WHAT A MESS. I THINK THE MALL'S OVER HERE. CAREFUL. COME AND SIT DOWN. THERE YOU GO. OH... I'M SORRY. COME ON, MOM. I REALLY NEED YOU NOW. Nick: SO NOW, CAN I HAVE THE PASSWORD? I THOUGHT YOU SAID THIS WASN'T ABOUT MONEY. IT'S NOT ABOUT THE MONEY! WELL, IT'S A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE MONEY. ALL RIGHT THEN. I'LL GIVE YOU THE 15 MILLION AND YOU GIVE ME THE CHIP. AND I WANT A KISS. WOULD YOU JUST QUIT MESSING AROUND, NICK? IT'S NOT FUNNY ANYMORE. JUST TELL ME WHERE IT IS. I GIVE YOU THE CODE, YOU GO GET THE MONEY, YOU TAKE OFF TO SOME DESERTED ISLAND SOMEWHERE, AND YOU LIVE HAPPILY EVER AFTER. I MEAN, IT'S A LOT OF DOUGH, NICK. YOU CAN LIVE A COUPLE OF LIFETIMES EASILY ON THAT MUCH MONEY. YOU THINK SO, HUH? MOST PEOPLE COULD LIVE COMFORTABLY ON 2 MILLION, LET ALONE 15 MILLION. YOU THINK MY REVENGE CAN BE BOUGHT OFF LIKE SOME KIND OF GAMBLING DEBT? THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M SAYING. ARE YOU SAYING THAT MY WIFE'S LIFE IS WORTH $2 MILLION? WOULD YOU TRADE YOUR DAUGHTER'S LIFE FOR $2 MILLION? HOW ABOUT 15... OR EVEN 30? TELL ME, AM I GETTING WARM? ENOUGH! THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M SAYING. I'M JUST TRYING TO TELL YOU THAT YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY PERSON IN THE WORLD THAT'S EVER LOST... SOMEBODY THAT THEY REALLY LOVED. LET IT GO. HERE IT IS. IT'S ON THE THIRD LEVEL.
