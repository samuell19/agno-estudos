You know this damned witch Sycorax, was banished from Argier for her terrible sorceries too mischievous to enter human hearing. For one thing they would not take her life. This blue-eyed hag was left here by the sailors. Because she was brought with a child: Caliban. Ariel, my slave, As you call yourself, You were servant of Sycorax; And you, a spirit too delicate To act her abhorred commands, by force of her more potent powers, she painfully trapped you in her most unmitigable rage, Into a cloven tree; And within its hollow for twelve years you remained prisoner. Location: an uninhabited island. [Fire] [Night] [Snow] Characters for a Tempest by William Shakespeare. Prospero, the right Duke of Milan. Antonio, his brother, the usurping Duke of Milan. Ferdinand, son to the King of Naples. Mariners. Gonzalo, an honest old Counsellor. Trinculo, a Jester. Master of a Ship. Boatswain. Miranda, daughter to Prospero. Caliban, a slave. And Sycorax, Caliban's mother? Where is Sycorax? The first of these characters to step on this island. Her? Maybe her? Where is Sycorax? Why would she trapped Ariel in a tree? [Swamp] [Wind] [Night] [Bees] - That's for Sycorax? - Yes, let's try it. You know that these capes were made with whale bones. There are many whales on this island. I didn't know. But what I like the most of these capes is that women could walk out there without being recognized. Thanks to that, they could do whatever they wanted. Sometimes they could only be recognized for the shoes, but not always, because the shoes were also very similar. You lie, malignant thing! Have you forgotten the foul witch Sycorax, who with age and envy was grown into a crooked hoop? Have you forgotten her? How do you imagine her? Sycorax? Neither old, nor wicked, or ugly, or crooked. I wouldn't believe Prospero so much. The problem in the play is that Sycorax is voiceless. So what are these women going to say? No word that does not appear in the play. Sycorax I.

You well know in which torments I found you; Your groans made wolves howl, and penetrated the breasts of angry bears: it was a torment which Sycorax could not undo: It was my art, when I arrived and heard you, that opened that tree, and set you free When you first arrived, Prospero You caressed me, and cared much for me; You would give me water with berries and teach me how to name the bigger light, and the smaller one, That burn by day and night: I loved you then, And showed you all the qualities of the isle, The fresh springs, brine-pits, barren lands and fertile ones. In which tree did you trap Ariel? This island they want to steal. Ariel, this tree will take care of you. Are you sure Ariel is in the tree? Is this the tree? Yes. I don't hear anything. I think you're asleep. How long will I sleep for? It could be years. Who will wake me up? Come in. In here? And close your eyes. How am I going to wake up? How would you like to? With some of my songs. I will sing until you wake up. While you sleep here peacefully. conspiracies happen in full view of all If you care for the life you keep Shake yourself off and beware.
