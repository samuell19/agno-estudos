Suzie stone, that is so unladylike. Man: Aunt Nelly, relax. It's Christmas. She's just having fun. The dinner table is not a playground, George. Suzie: Why can't you have fun everywhere? You can, Suzie, if you don't want to make a decent living. A little money in your pocket would not be so terrible. Aunt Nelly: Especially with another mouth on the way. We have enough money, don't we, dad? We have food on the table, we got a roof over our head. I call that plenty enough. See, we have plenty enough. You know, I'll bet Elizabeth wouldn't mind a washing machine. Oh, a washing machine! Aunt Nelly, he's a crook. He's always been a crook. I likenixon. I voted for him, and I'd vote for him again. Give it up, aunt Nelly. If you ask me, I think he's just a popinjay creep who should've gone to jail. Right on, pumpkin! Really, George, why do you encourage her? That's what he does. Suzie, remember what we've been talking about. If she doesn't learn to keep a civil tongue in her head -- I'm not invisible, aunt Nelly. Suzie, that's enough sass out of you. Consider yourself warned. Boy: What's a popinjay? Popinjay's a crow who thinks he's an eagle. All right, young lady, you're grounded for a week. Bobby did it first. Why don't you ground him? Because you're the oldest. So unfair. No pouting, Suzie. It's really boring. Nobody likes a boring girl. George: Come on, we should all cheer up. It's Christmas, for goodness' sake! Who wants the cranberry sauce? This table keeps getting smaller and smaller. Aunt Nelly: What did you expect, George? If they're not dead, they move to Florida. I've decided that I want everyone to call me Susan. Huh. Now it's Susan. Huh. Well, you can be whatever you want, pumpkin, but you'll always be Suzie to me. I think it's wonderful, Susan. You're becoming such a proper young lady. You know, she made the Dean's list. Where is her roommate? I thought she was coming? She couldn't make it. She's just ashamed to bring her rich vassar friends here. That is an absolute lie, Bobby. Well, I certainly hope so, suze, 'cause you is what you is and you ain't what you ain't. Elizabeth: That's nonsense, George! Why did you bake such a big bird this year? Bobby, where's Elizabeth? Bobby: [ Shouting ] I told you, aunt Nelly, mom moved to Florida after dad died, remember?! I hate Florida. Turkey's just too boring. Yeah, well, Benjamin Franklin and I respectfully disagree. They're actually very smart, and if we could understand gobblespeak, we might find them quite witty. Next year, I think we should try goose. What do you think, Peter? I wasn't listening. Aunt Nelly, I've asked you not to smoke in the house. Absolutely ridiculous! So, suze, how's work? Oh, schizophrenic. I mean, one day tedious, the next absolutely thrilling. Like, last week, I found the most extraordinary first-time writer. Sounds great.He's beyond great -- Susan, darling, you know I hate it when you gush. William faulkner is great. Dylan Lewis is just okay. I thought you liked him, Peter. I dolike him. I also like donne. It doesn't mean I think it's great. Man: Ah, Dylan Lewis. How is he doing, Susan? Susan? Susan? We should probably move him to fall of next year. Really, Susan, it's been forever. By the time he finishes, do you suppose that anyone will remember him? That's advertising's problem, dorinda. What's going on with carlotta Crawford? Still at Betty Ford. Too busy washing floors to write? [ Laughter ] No, actually, she's working away. Building up those abs. Anything else, Susan? Nothing new? That's it, at least for today. All right, I guess that's it. Have a nice Thanksgiving, you guys. You, too, Walter. [ Telephone ringing ] You have reached Dylan Lewis and leave a message. [ Beep] Susan: Dilly. Dylan, pick up, I know you're there. We need to talk. We have now entered the realm of the ridiculous. Walter is extremely upset and I have lost what little Patience I have left. I need a real date when you are going to be finished, all right? No more excuses. Call me. Indulgent baby. [ Knock on door ] Hi. Your weekend reading. Robin, that's it? That's all there is? Well, it's all that's come in so far, but I'm actually hoping to get this manuscript. From whom?Uh, his name is Tom weller, he was a partner in Ben's law firm --who's Ben? Ben's my fiancé. You've met him several times. Lawyer? You mean courtroom stuff? Family history, actually. Anyway, he was a partner until about two years ago, when his dead aunt pru came to him in a dream and she told him to write this novel.His dead aunt pru? It sounds a little weird, I know. I've been working with him, Susan, and I really think the book's gonna be great! Tell you what, if you're going to lunch, why don't you bring me back a salad, okay? Susan, the office is closing early because of the holidays. Everybody else has already gone home, and dorinda said she doesn't need me anymore. My family's coming in from Michigan, but if you want -- you know, I don't want. I don't want. Happy Thanksgiving, Susan. [ Door closes ] [ Siren wails in distance ] Those are nice.Yeah. Yeah. You want one? [ Beep] Bobby: Hey, suze, it's your brother. The bird will be ready by 2:00, so try and be here at 1:30, and bring a white wine. Bye. [ Beep] [ Modem buzzing ] [ Rapidly ] Gobble! Gobble! Gobble! Gobble! Gobble! Gobble! Gobble! Gobble! Gobble! Gobble! Gobble! Gobble! Gobble! Gobble! Gobble! Gobble! Gobble! Gobble! Gobble! Gobble! Gobble! Gobble! Gobble! Gobble! Gobble! Gobble! Gobble! Very witty, Bob. Wonderful role-modeling. Oh, relax. So, how's work? Good. How's yours? It's great. I hate it when you exaggerate. I'm not. It's true. I got this one kid, he's so unbelievably smart, he should be teaching me. We're trying to get him a scholarship to Harvard. Why, so he can follow in your footsteps? Would you relax? You're like one big isometric contraction. Why does it bother you so much I love what I do? I love teaching. Because the pay stinks and it's dangerous. Oh, pooh. [ Laughing ] Alice, why don't you show your aunt Susan your letter to Santa? Sure. Be right back. How old is she now? 7. Really, Bob, I mean -- Susan, I know where you're going with this, and don't go there. She is old enough to be told the truth. You just hate to see her grow up.Susan, please. The truth about what? Nothing, al. About what? Alice, honey, Santa claus, kriss kringle, Noel baba, whatever you want to call him, is a myth based on a bishop who lived in the third century, and not even in the north pole. He lived in Turkey, where it's really hot. He really isn't real. That's not true! Just because there are fake ones on corners and in department stores doesn't mean that there's not a real one! Tell her, dad! She's wrong...Isn't she? Yeah, honey, she's wrong, and I'm gonna tell her in private, okay? So I just want you to come over here, sit down, and finish your pie, all right? There you go. Can I see you in the kitchen, please? Sure. You pompous, insensitive -- calm down. All I did was tell her the truth about Santa claus. I didn't kill anybody. Yes, you did, suze. It's what you do. It's like you get some sadistic pleasure out of spreading a little unhappiness here, a little disappointment over there. She's 7 years old, for god's sake! I said lower your voice. She is almost 8, and she's very smart. She's very vulnerable! Oh, what? And so in order to protect her, we should all pretend that life is a bowl of cherries and never mention choking on the pits? Is that it? I think Alice is smart enough to eat a cherry and spit out the pit without choking on it, unlike some people I know. Really? You know what I find absolutely mind-boggling, Bob? What's that? Your wife died too young, you have too many kids, you do not have two dimes to rub together, and still you insist on pretending that everything is just hunky-dory. You know what? I just don't get that. No, you wouldn't, would you, because you actually think that there's something wrong with me because I can find some joy in all this mess. And what's more, you resent it -- that I'm happy, that I like who I am and what I do. Please. I'm serious, suze. You are so miserable, you can't even imagine why other people aren't as miserable as you. And what's more -- you know what? Forget it. Maybe you just shouldn't come around anymore. Well, that's mature, isn't it? No, I'm serious. You don't even really want to be here. The only reason you come is some neurotic sense of duty. So let me get this straight. Not only am I an insensitive, pompous sadist, I'm also neurotic. You want the truth? Try this -- I don't even like you anymore... And I don't want you around my kids. Fine. Fine, I'm outta here. I'm sorry to have contaminated all of you with a dose of reality. Happy Thanksgiving, idiot. [ Band playing "good king wenceslas" ] Oh, god! Where the hell was I when Christmas started the day after Thanksgiving? Never a day off, huh, miss stone? I get more done without any distractions. [ Band playing "hark! The herald angels sing" in distance ] [ Dialing ] Robin, it's me. It's 10:00 on Friday. You're probably out with your family, but I'm at the office and I need you to come in. I'll be here all day. [ Playing "silent night" ] Man: Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! Girl: I won't, mommy! You promised! You promised! I hate you! Aaaaaaaaahhhhhh! Aah! Ohh! Ow! Miss? Miss? Miss?

I'm not Alice. Don't play games. Where is your father? Bob! Bob, are you here? What are you doing here? I'm not going through another Christmas without celebrating. What are you talking about, Alice? I told you, I'm not Alice. Oh, fine. When are you gonna pull this place together? It's been over a year since you divorced Peter and moved in. I can't believe he left you here. Alice: Hello? Is your father home? He's napping. Who's this? Aunt Susan. Who's this? Alice.alice. Dad says you don't know anything. He says you can only think with your head, and he says you're a doodleberry. [ Dial tone ] Nowdo you believe me? [ Hangs up telephone ] No, this is not one of Bob's idiotic schemes to teach you a lesson. I never said it was. But you were thinking it. Put your coat on. I'm taking you home. Come on, come on. [ Dog barking in distance ] If I were you, I wouldn't mention me. [ Doorbell chimes ] [ Alice giggles ] Susan, um... I meant what I said. You're not welcome here. Really. Mmmm! [ Door closes, locks ] Can we go home now? Ohh. Paging Dr. Bender, paging Dr. Bender. It seems like everything is fine. Are you sure? Yeah, that's the way it looks. Now, if you do experience any kind of abnormal headaches or lethargy in the next couple of weeks, come back 'cause it could indicate a slow blood leak. But I doubt that since you never lost consciousness, okay? Could I possibly have a tumor? What makes you think you have a tumor? I don't know. Well, you show no evidence of a tumor. Are you sure? Would you like to have a tumor? Don't be silly, doctor. Of course not, I'm not crazy. I just thought that maybe since you were looking for a concussion, you may have missed a tumor. Ah, you're probably still a little traumatized. So why don't you go home, put some ice on that bump, make yourself a warm glass of milk, and try to rest. Okay? Okay. Okay. Oh, god. Weird. Hi! Aaaaaah! [ Giggling ] Ohhh! Oh, oh, Bob, Bob, please pick up, it's me. You're gonna have to deal with me. Oh, go away, whoever you are! Suzie! Suzie Ann stone, how can you not know me? You're what? I'm you when you were 7, and I'm not going away. Ohhh. I'm going to have a good night's sleep. I'll be fine. Ohh! You forgot to brush your teeth... Goose breath. Peekaboo, I see you! Ohh! Ohh! Please don't let me be crazy. [ Car horn honks ] [ Coughs ] [ Sighs ] Can we go out and play? Please! Please go away! I willgo away, but not until you learn to be nice to me! What am I gonna do?! Too bad there's no one you could share this with. Bob wants nothing to do with US. You've abandoned all your friends 'cause the dreaded Peter didn't like them. And if you get rid of me, there'll reallybe no one. Who areyou? See? You never listen to me. Let me say this slowly -- I am you. You are me. We are US. I've lost my mind! Your mind's okay. What you've lost is all your otherstuff. Let's do something fun for a change! How about we go ice skating? Or the opera? We lovethe opera! Well, at least iof the we still do. Well, meof the we...

And we'd pretend he was after US, and after school, we'd run home and slam the door, and he couldn't come in, 'cause our house was magic, and we'd laugh -- ha ha ha ha! He wasn't real.

But that manuscript that I told you about -- the one that I was helping Ben's friend with -- he should be upstairs with it now, and I really think it could really be a really great book. I mean, it's a little long, but it combines history and fantasy and reality, and the characters -- I just can't imagine anyone not loving it, and... It's really good, and because he's new at this, I warned him that, you know, that you might want to trim a few things because of course I know how much you hate when things aren't concise, and so he's totally prepared.

Halley Barnes. She's 24. And I think we should make a deal before someone else scoops her up. Are you suggesting we buy a first novel based on 85 pages? Mark: Exactly. I think we ought to hold onto our jockstraps and plunge ahead. I'll hold onto my girdle, thank you very much. [ Laughter ] Well, let's read her, Mark. If you'rethis excited, i'mexcited. Susan, any updates? Is that it? All right, let's go to work. Susan...what's going on? It seems like a long time since you've been your old self. You mean since my balance sheet's been in the "plus" column. Or got a good review. Speaking of which, where the hell is Jack Richmond? Sri Lanka. As a matter of fact, he just called. He wants another -- tell him to call script nurse. And what about carlotta Crawford? When's she checking out of Betty Ford?Not until January. Well, I can't keep covering for you, sue. You're gonna have to come up with something. We're locking the holiday schedule for next year in less than a month. In 24 days -- I know. I really do. I didn't want to say anything yet, but there's a manuscript being duplicated even as we speak, and I've read some of it, and I think it could be great. I really do. I hope so. Is it myfault that Dylan Lewis is blocked, that carlotta Crawford has a drinking problem? I mean, what does Walter expect me to do, sit them down and force their fingers to the keys? I'm an editor, not a nursemaid. He's so busy being seduced by that little twit, Mark, he's forgotten all the blood and sweat that i'vegiven to Blair house. Actually, Mark is tall.

The lawyer? Cute? I don't know. I've never really been attracted to blonds. This soda's flat. He wasn't a blond. He had dark hair, and he looked like Jimmy Stewart. Aw, who cares? Come on, let's go. Maybe, by some miracle, this book won't be totallyawful. [ Sighs ] "Phooey"? 758 pages! Robin, you idiot! You expect me to read a 758-page book called "phooey"?! Ilike it -- "phooey." Easy to remember, and it says a lot. "Phooey" says a lot? At least read the first chapter. Come on, what do you have to lose? "As the old carriage rattled past the graveyard, "through the fine mist, she could see her firstborn, "the avowed atheist himself, risen from the dead, sitting in a gigantic, old Chestnut tree, laughing." That is intolerable.How could it be intolerable? You've only read a paragraph! Robin! What?! What's the matter?! Your friend's manuscript -- what could you possibly be thinking?! Well, I know it's a little long -- oh, it's beyondlong! And whatever I've read so far is completely frivolous and aggravating! I mean, I thought you said it was good. Well, it starts off a little slow. Wait, how far did you get? Oh, far enough! [ Band playing "good king wenceslas" ] If I were you -- which I am -- I'd finish reading "phooey" and hope it's good...

If you spent as much time doingactual work, like you used to, instead of pretendingto work, like you do, maybe you wouldn't be in such a mess. I'm not reading any more of that silly book. Why?

"But she didn't really believe it "until she saw my great-grandfather Patrick floating in her milk when she was 11." I like that. That's preposterous. You think Santa claus is preposterous. "Each year, the vision returned on the morning of march 15th, "which was the day she finally met the tall, handsome bachelor "with eyes even bluer than hers "aboard the queen Anne on their way to america. "On the second day of the crossing, she proposed. "On the third, they were married. "And on the fourth, my great-uncle John was conceived. "She already knew when and how John would die at 25. "He would be shot twice in the head and once in the chest while walking his beat on commonwealth Avenue in Boston." Young Susan: "Aunt phooey had run away "with the strongman at the circus "two years before I was born. "Her real name was Phoebe, "but when my mother was a baby, she called her 'phooey' "because she couldn't say the name 'Phoebe.' "and somehow the name just stuck. "Both of them had inherited my grandmother's red Mark, but only phooey had the gift." Susan: "And at that moment, I remembered what phooey had said "when the ashes of her life were floating in the air -- "it's what you say yes to that determines your life. "The nos just lead nowhere. Well, I guess now it's myturn." You're here already! What? Oh, uh...Uh, never mind. Uh...uh, give me Tom weller's number. You finished it? You liked it?! Well, it couldbe good if you took a hatchet to it. And the title, "phooey," that's absolutely out of the question. Just get him on the phone, okay? W-Well, remember how I told you that he took a leave of absence from the firm, right? To write the novel. And when he did that, he also moved back to his family home in this pretty little town in Connecticut, but he also kept his apartment here, so I'm just not exactly sure where -- well, why don't we try eachof the places, hmm? Right. Right. Why can't you be nice? Why do find it so hard to say, "great work, Robin," or at least, "goodwork"? I don't have to compliment her. She was just doing her job. Susan, before I dial him, I just wanted to, uh -- do you remember how yesterday, how you were saying that you thought that "phooey" was frivolous and aggravating? Well, I -- I just sort of -- I gave a copy of it to dorinda. She was actually surprised I hadn't gone to her first -- you what?! Well, I do... Work for bothof you. Well, I didn't say I was gonna pass! No, but you said it really negative.Well, get it back, Robin! Okay, I'm sure she hasn't read it yet. No, no, no, no! Just give me the numbers! Thank you. See that? The world is just full of little miss Uriah heeps waiting to stab you in the back. She was only doing her job. Why are you taking herside? Why are we wasting time being sour about Robin?! This is what we dream of! This is the fun part! It's right in front of US! A new writer! I'm so excited! A new writer! I'm gonna burst! You're right. Why waste my time being sour? I am gonna bag Tom weller. I am gonna look him in the eye and tell him the truth. Yes. And together we are gonna shape and hone and sculpt that manuscript into a book that will not only wow the literary critics, but make it to the top of every bestseller list in every major city in the United States of America! I lovedit, Tom! I absolutely loved it! A-And the characters -- you have such a wonderful ear. I really haven't been this excited about a book in a century. I mean -- you don't lookthat old. [ Laughs ] Well, it seemslike a century. I'm not saying that it's not interesting, wonderful material, but we don't need to know the intimate details of every one of his ancestors in order to understand Patrick's conflict.Really. All that does is postpone the narrative in a book that's too long already.Oh. Look, I've been thinking about this. What would you think if we opened the book with a beautifully drawn family tree -- sort of like one of those illuminated manuscripts -- and follow it with a short introductory chapter setting up the whole internal tug of war between his crazy Ryan side and his straight-laced blackstones? Hmm. Tom, if we're gonna work together, I need to be completely open and honest with you. I can't hold back what I think. Uh-huh. Now, frankly, those first five chapters aren't as good or as vivid or as affecting as what follows. Look, I know how hard it is to have someone sweep in out of the blue and tell you that you have to give up a part of yourself, but I don't think that I would be doing my job if I didn't argue for those cuts. If it's not a lot shorter, the book will probably not get published. Well, then, maybe it shouldn'tbe. Well... Tom, I think it could be a reallyimportant book. Miss stone, I, uh -- no. No. I don't think so. No. No. This is mystory. It's about myfamily. I want to tell it myway, so, uh... Very nice seeing you, but, uh, no. I am not going to cut the first five chapters of "phooey." No. No sirree. No. Not a chance. It's not going to work out. Thank you for the lunch. [ Jackhammer pounding ] [ Horns honking ] Come on, suze. Time to get up. Come on! Come on! Let's see a little fight! Let's see a little gumption! Oh, go away. [ Telephone ringing ] Oh, god. Hello. Robin. [ Sighs ] No, I'm not coming in. I'm sick. Well, I don't care if dorinda's meeting with Tom. She can move in with him for all I care. No, I don't want to talk to anybody. Just tell Walter that I'm too sick to get out of bed. All right. You think if you're sick enough, Walter won't fire you? You little monster. This is all your fault. Why are you always picking on me and Robin and all the people who loveyou?! Why don't you ever pick on the horrors in your life, like dorinda?! [ Telephone ringing ] Oh, god! Look -- ow! Robin, I am so -- what? Oh! Oh. Uh, Jack, no. I, uh -- what? No. [ Sighs ] No, look -- Jack, uh, Walter said no more advances. I really don't know -- what? Wh-- you know what? You just -- y-you -- you just -- don't you dare talk to me like that! Who do you think you are, huh?! I mean, you haven't sent in page one, and you've already gotten more money than your last two books earned! Yes, I'm serious! You have no idea how serious I am! You know, Jack, Blair house pays for books, not for trips around the world to gamble and seduce underage girls with doctored reviews! Yeah, so, I'll tell you what -- if you want more money, I suggest you call scribner's, Jack! Yes, scribner's! Maybe theywill subsidize you, you hack! Yes! That's the girl I remember -- the one that beat up Jimmy Milton! Yeah, dad's famous combination. I really kicked his butt, didn't I? I'll say! You were great! You've always been great! Vassar! Class president! Boy, that was a fight! That obnoxious Peggy dupon -- ka-boom! -- didn't know what hit her! God, I haven't thought about her in years. Then, there was the guy from adpub who hated dilly's first book, remember? Yeah, yeah. Phil "the pill" dembrowski. You stood up at that meeting, and you gave one of these... And that! Then when dilly was nominated for a pulitzer, Phil "the pill" was asking you to lunch! Dilly should've won. He will...Next time. You're great, suze. You've always been great. I sure do miss dad. Me too. I wonder what he would think of me now. Dad loved US... No matter what. You know that. Even when we forgot. We is what we is, and we ain't what we ain't. Let's take dilly to lunch. Susan: Dilly, listen to me -- you have written 2/3 of a brilliant novel. You know exactly where it is going. I'm not doing this on purpose. I tried. I just -- I can't. I just -- I'm no good. Dilly, this isn't the first time this has happened. I know it's difficult for you to understand 'cause you're always so together. Dill. This time, it's different. I can feel the synapses in my brain disintegrating. My brain cells are frying. Feel. Feel. Feel right there. Can you feel the electrical impulses? [ Buzzes ] No. I don't know how you can't feel it. Have you stopped taking your medication? It robs me of my creativity. Dilly, come on! You have to get through this. All right? Let's see a little fight, a little gumption. Do you remember that guy from adpub who hated your first novel? Phil "the pill"? Yeah, and then when you got nominated, he asked you to lunch, and you told him to order crow. I didn't win. Well, you will this time. Now let's get back on our medication and finish. Who can write when there are constant bells and whistles in their ears? [ Sniffs ] This is just hopeless. I'm quitting. I quit. That's fabulous! Quitting is fabulous? If you're not afraid to quityour job, you're afraid to doyour job! You know, I am so sick of your constant nattering and chattering. Since the day I laid eyes on you, it's all been, listen to me. Watch me. "It's all gonna get better." Well, you know something?! It isn't! It is so! Well, at least you're trying! Yeah, and getting nowhere! The only thing that I have succeeded in is feeling like a total failure! Before, you weren't feeling anything at all! Well, don't you get it?! I don't wantto feel anything! Listen to what you're saying! I know exactly what I am saying! And if you dare say that I shouldn't quit, I am gonna strangle you! Woman: Blair house. Yes, he is. One moment, please. [ Telephone ringing ] [ Gasps ] Just the person I wanted to see! The next time you say anything snide about Dylan Lewis, I will wrench open that clenched jaw and rip out your tongue! Do you understand me? And how dare you make a move on one of my writers! But I-I -- clench it! That was so cool and gutsy. Clench it! Are you okay? Do I lookokay?! Uh, okay. Well, we can do the Christmas list later. Even tomorrow, if you want, but we should -- I am not doing the Christmas list, I do not believe in the Christmas list, but I wouldlike to talk to you about run-on sentences -- [ telephone rings ] Hello! Tom? Oh! Oh! Tom, hi. Yes! She did? Yeah. Uh... Yeah, well, I-I guess dorinda is a little, um... When you put it like that, I guess she's a lot. Oh, you did? Yeah. See?! I told you! No, uh -- Connecticut? Well, no. I love -- I love Connecticut. Yes. No, I, um, I could come tomorrow. This is gonna be great. No. Actually, this is gonna be better than great. This is fantastic. Uh-huh. Okay. Uh, me too. All right. Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! What? Uh, nothing. Sorry. Tom weller thinks that dorinda is a growling, pretentious slime, and he's going with me. Really? Yeah, he's making a reservation for me at the white stag inn in new Dover. I should be there for about three weeks. So, listen, Robin, I want you to do some things for me while I'm gone, okay? I-I want you to bring dilly something to eat every day. He likes Chinese, okay? And, uh, take along one of his best old reviews, and make sure he takes his medication. And do that stupid Christmas list by yourself, okay? Okay. All right, well, go on. That's it. Don't dawdle. Go! Okay. Okay. All right. [ Sighs ] For the next few days, I want you to stop criticizing and correcting me, okay? Is that the meof the we or the iof the me? Why didn't you tell me I looked like this? You told me to clench it. [ Train whistle blows ] [ Steam hisses ] Where is he? He said he'd be here. Don't worry. He'll be here. [ Grunts ] This is not a good sign. Why do mywriters all have to be flakes? [ Barking ]Oh! Thoreau! Down, Thoreau! Behave yourself! I'm sorry. I hope you like dogs. Hi! You have to forgive Thoreau. He just loves meeting new people. Well, I'm glad you decided to come. Yes. Hang on there, Thoreau. I do love Connecticut. Yeah, have your bag here. We'll drop this off at the inn, huh? I'm parked right out front. He's even cuter than I remembered. Behave yourself. This is business. I told you he had brown hair! Tom: After cutting the third chapter, I realized I was starting to enjoy it. By the fourth and the fifth, I thought, "this is the way that serial killers must feel." Susan: Don't worry, Tom. Nothing's ever lost. It all simply gets rearranged... Like cellulite. What a beautiful house. My great-grandfather built it...For his bride. Great-grandfather? Mm-hmm. [ Laughs ] Oh. This is wonderful. Oh, here -- I want to show you something. You'll like this. Here she is...Aunt pru. Now, see, I always pictured this poster would be on the dust jacket with "'phooey' by Tom weller" printed in that same type style, huh? I thought you made up the red Mark. Her little -- no. No. That's one of the things that's actually real. So you mean all the Ryan women could tell the future? Mm-hmm. To a certain extent, even some of the men. Do, uh, you want something to eat? No. No. Actually, you know what? I would like to get started. What's the rush? Well, I want to release the book next Christmas, and the Blair-house list is locked on the 24th. That only gives US three weeks, which is tight, but if we stay focused, I think that it's doable, so... Um... Let's see here. Tom, did you know that Fitzgerald wanted to call "the great gatsby" "among the ash heaps and the millionaires"? You want to change the title. You think it's silly. Well...i dothink that it diminishes the book, yes. I knew that the minute you looked at the poster. See, I have a tiny bit of the gift myself. Oh. Well, I guess I'll have to watch my step, won't I? All right. Um, let's go to the top of chapter six, which is now our new chapter one. The sentence that starts "my mother" all the way through to "I will never forget" -- cut that. I think that's important. Well, you said it better 10 pages ago. Oh. Right. You're right. Aunt pru would've called you "one smart crackerjack." [ Clock chiming ] Oh, no. Oh, no. No. Oh, this isn't good. Oh, no. No. Oh, boy. You -- you gotta -- you gotta put on your coat. What are you talking about?Oh. Where are you going? We gotta go. This is not good. Thoreau, stay. We gotta go. Just follow me. Just, uh... Come on! Come on! All right. Hurry!i can't believe how late we are. Uh, what's going on? It's already after 5:00.Okay, well... Where are we going? Just...

Once upon a time, you did, too. This is the best day we've had in a century! Don't you just love Christmas? Go to sleep, okay? Maybe tomorrow will even be better. Shh. [ Clears throat ] [ Sighs ] Tom weller is not a serious person. All gone. All gone. Uh, all right. Now cut pages 221 through... What is it? 225. 225? All that? Yeah. But I want to save uncle John's ghost. I know just where to put it, too. Right. The top of chapter eight. Well, that's just what iwas thinking. Tom: So, now the woman who only wants to cut, cut, cut, now she wants to add? Well, I think that Patrick's mother and father fall in love too quickly. I mean, look, I just think there should be a series of scenes so that the reader can experience the process more. What process? There is no process. That's why it's called "love at first sight." I guess you've never experienced it, have you? Well, have you? Absolutely. Every happy couple I've ever met -- at least one of them has fallen in love at first sight. Otherwise, they would've never made it to the second date. You know, when I was a little girl, my father used to tell me this story about being at a party with my uncle bill. Uh-huh. And he looked across the room and saw my mother there in a white organdy dress. And he turned to my uncle bill and said, "that girl's gonna be my wife." I always thought he made that up, you know? A fairy tale just for me. It never occurred to me that it could've been true. I promise you it was true. Otherwise, you wouldn't be here. Well...[clears throat] It's getting late. Maybe we should pick this up tomorrow. Okay. Oh, sorry. [ "Good king wenceslas" plays ] [ Sniffling ] Susan: My dad was a sax player, and my mom -- We lived in queens. He was the poorest of all his brothers and sisters, but I think that he thought he was the richest. Well, I guess if you have to choose between being a sax player and a wholesale butcher, you know? Though I have to admit, for years I didn't understand that.Hmm. Sometimes I still don't. But he certainly laughed a lot more, and everybody always came to ourhouse for all the holidays. Why am I telling you all this? Because I asked. Well, I know you asked, but why did I answer? [ Sighs ] It must be the book. I've been remembering things I...hadn't thought about in years. Just all of a sudden, I know exactly what you looked like when you were a little girl. [ Sighs ] What if they hate it? Then they'll be wrong. [ Tom whistles ] [ Thoreau barks ] Come on, Thoreau. We did some good work today, don't you think? It felt good. Thoreau. Do you really think that life is shaped by the yes's and not the no's? Mm-hmm. Well, I said yes once, and it was a complete disaster. Hmm. Well, my guess is that you were just saying the word. What you were really doing is saying no to yourself. You're a remarkable talent, Tom weller. Thanks. And Robin was right. You are a great editor, Susan stone. Thank you. Is it that late? I guess so. Yeah. All right. Well, um, I'll see you bright and early. Okay. All right. Good night. Good night. [ Clears throat ] Good night. Bye. [ Humming ] Suze? Hmm? I think he wanted to kiss you. Don't be ridiculous. This is strictly a working relationship. Why can't it be both? Because you don't make your bed where you eat. Well, he sure is a lot of fun. Suze? Hmm? I love that he plays the trombone. [ "Deck the halls" plays ] I'm beginning to think that you don't understand phooey as a character. I do too. Well, then why would you want me to change phooey's reaction? Because I just don't believe that any sane woman who's thrown into a squalid jail in Selma is gonna be so serene and calm -- I mean, almost happy. See, you really don't understand. You don't know what you're missing here. I'm on a diet. Oh! You don't need to diet! Come on. Come on. Try this. [ Laughs ] Hmm? Now, see, phooey was one of those rare, wonderful people, no matter what the disaster, she always saw it as an opportunity. The glass was always half-full. Of course, that drives the half-empties totally crazy. Who does that remind you of? That is wonderful. This woman is a genius. Finish it. Finish it. Oh. Thank you. Mmm. [ Laughs ] Mmm. Wait till you try her Napoleon. You know, I think aunt pru would've loved my brother Bob. Yeah? Well, in that case, I probably will, too. I told you -- prince charming. [ Computer keys clicking ] Julie? Hi, it's Susan. Would you please get Robin for me? Hi, Robin. What's going on? Good, good. You wouldn't believe all the work we've gotten done in the last two weeks. You want to patch me through to dilly? How you doing? That's wonderful, dilly. Yeah. Yeah, that wasa great review. How about getting another one, huh? New pages. Oh, dilly. That's great. No, that's -- that's better than great. That's wonderful. Yeah. Oh, I'm -- I'm glad you like her. Robin is sweet, isn't she? Yeah. Okay. All right. Yeah, you know what? I'm just checking in with you, so i'm, uh... I'll just call you back later, okay? Okay. All right. Bye. Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Oh, my god! Oh! Yes! Yes! Yes! Ooh! Ooh! Tom: No, I don't think so. Susan: Well, I think so. Never. No way. No, no. No, I won't. I won't. I can't!Of course you can. No, no, no, no. Forget it. Why should I have to? This is my damn book. Because I'm not gonna let you put your name on anything that isn't your best work, you... [ Laughs ] You...You...What? What? What? You know what -- no, no, no. You finish it. What? What? What? N-n-n-no. Where do you think you're going? Finish it. Finish. Finish. Doodleberry. Doodleberry? That's it? That's it? That's the best you can come up with? Well, I'm just the editor, aren't I? I mean, you're the writer, aren't you, you old windbagger? Oh, no. Now you apologize. I'm not gonna apologize, and you can't make me. Mmm. Mmm.mmm. Mmm. Mmm. This is a disaster. A little schizophrenic,maybe. No, this never happened, all right? Say this never happened. Look, I need you to say that this never happened. I could say that, but it wouldn't be true. No, no! It never happened, all right? [ Tom whistles ] Let's go. Come on, Thoreau. [ Thoreau barks ] Susan: What was I thinking? You weren'tthinking. That's a good thing, not a bad thing. Totally, totally unprofessional. Baloney. You're just afraid all men are like Peter. Bob isn't. Dad wasn't. I finally get myself a damn new decent writer, and I blow it! [ Sighs ] So, anyway, if I can make the noon train, I can, uh, get it on the weekend read. Just a little surprised, that's all. Thought we had a few more days. Didn't realize we were done. Well, not "done" done, but done enough to get some input. Mmm. So, uh, what are you doing for the holidays? Oh, I'm not sure. I was actually thinking of just staying at home this year, so -- hmm. Oop! Careful. You're stepping on uncle hiram, there. Oh, sorry. Sorry. I never knew anyone who had their own cemetery. My mother and father. Mom... Dad... I'd like you to meet Susan. Think they would have liked you. You sure you're not running back because of last night? Tom, um, last night was entirely my fault. I-It was a huge mistake. We could never, ever, ever possibly become romantically involved. But we already are. No, no. It can't happen. I mean, it would be a disaster for the book. But, I-I-I see it happen. What are you talking about? I've already seen it. See, I -- oh, please. Tom, come on. You're being crazy now, okay? I mean, one indiscreet moment means nothing more than one indiscreet moment when we were both so tired that we lost it. I didn't lose it. Listen to me, okay? I'm your editor. That is all. Nothing more. But, Susan -- no, I like you, I do, just... Not in that way. Oh. I'm...I'm sorry. I... Well, I guess maybe I, uh... [ Clears throat ] ...maybe I don'thave the gift, after all, huh? [ Church bell rings in distance ] Um...well, maybe we should get started. Um...i don't want to be late. No. [ "God rest ye merry gentlemen" plays ] Well, um, I'll call you as soon as I hear anything. Okay. Oh, uh, regarding the title, why don't you make a list, and I'll make a list? Right. Well... Merry Christmas, Susan. You too. Don't worry. I'm sure that everyone will love the book. Okay. Here. [ Playing "good king wenceslas" ] Woman: Blair house. No, he's not in right now. I'll take a message. [ Door opens ] Blair house. Sorry. Make 15 copies. I want to distribute them personally. And change the title page to "untitled," all right? Did Tom weller call? No. Was he supposed -- good morning, Robin. Good morning, Susan. Who the hell do we give these to? Who do we think is a definite "yes"? Nobody. Probably "yes" -- maybe Gloria. At least she has a sense of humor. Oh...what about Herbert? Possibly "yes." Donald? He's a definite "no." Mark's another "no." He'll like it better than anybody. I'm not even gonna give it to that teeny-bopper. He won't think it's hip enough. You're wrong about Mark. I wish there was some way of keeping dorinda off the list, short of stabbing her in the throat. What a mess. Ram it through, like in the old days. Remember those? Only vaguely. [ Band playing "hark, the herald angel sings" ] Tom could play that better. [ Knock on door ] Um...from dilly. Thank you. May I say something? Please. I think it was brilliant of you to have him read his reviews, and the work you did on "phooey" is -- please don't call it "phooey." Sorry. What should I call it, then? Why don't we just call it "untitled" for now? Okay. Well, you know how much I loved "untitled" before, right? But now, it's just -- Susan, it's...It... Okay, I got it. Thank you. Um, Susan? Good luck tomorrow. [ Door closes ] [ Siren wails in distance ] [ Sighs ] [ Playing "joy to the world" ] [ Telephone ringing ] Think positive. They're all gonna love it. Walter: Oh, Susan. Good. Are we all here? Let's get started, people. I wanted to like it. My brother and he were practically roommates at Harvard. In fact, I met with him a few weeks ago when it was still called "phooey," and I passed. [ Sighs ] I know, okay. You want me to be truthful. It hasn't improved. It's still absolutely endless, not to mention stupid. Chacun à son gôut, as the French say. Pbht! Herbert? I...well... Actually I didn't finish it. I thought the writing was okay, but I found myself wandering. Gloria, what did you think? I had that big party for Wolfgang. I just didn't have a minute. I'm really, really sorry. I'll get to it tonight. I promise. Donald, did you get a chance to look at it? It's not my cup of tea, Walter. I don't know. It's...a little too fantastic pour moi. Pbht! What does marketing say? If we don't spend a lot, we won't lose a lot. It could even be a wash. Susan... You haven't said a word. I only have one thing to say to all of you. Tom weller's a superb and unique talent, and I think that his book is brilliant. It's funny and charming and very smart, and, on top of that, I think it's gonna make money. And frankly, if Blair house doesn't publish this book, then...I'm not really sure what I'm doing here anymore. I agree. Mark, you weren't on Susan's list. I overheard several assistants raving about it in the kitchen, so I bootlegged a copy. And, uh, look, this guy may be a little unusual, but that's the whole point. I thinksusan's absolutely correct. I mean, wake up. Would you not say publish John Irving because sometimes he's a little fantastic? And that's just one tiny aspect of it. I mean, what about the americana of it all? And the romance? And, dorinda... Don't tell me you didn't at least love all the dirty parts. [ All laughing hysterically ] Come on, guys, get with it. If we don't nail this guy down, somebody else will. And won't we be embarrassed when it gets out that we had him first and didn't publish him? Anyway, I'm a strong "yes." Well, Susan, ha! Can't wait to read your new guy. Well, actually, Walter, it was Robin who found him. Oh! Good work, Robin. All right, is that it? Then let's get back to work. [ Indistinct conversations ] I told you that was a great proposal... Okay... Susan? Something's happened to you the last couple of weeks. I like it. Thank you, Walter. So do I. Susan!ahh! Thank you so much! You have no idea how much that meant to me. I mean, I've been wrong about you this whole time. I thought you hated me! Did you know that?! And nobody ever... I mean -- I'm so sorry that Ben and I called you the wicked witch of the west. We were completely wrong. But it's just 'cause I didn't have any idea. You're so amazing! And no one ever gives their assistant credit ever! Did you know that?Well, you deserve the credit, Robin. You really do.I only found the book. You fixed it. No, you deserve credit.I learned so much from you. You really do. You really do. Now, I want you to run along and come back in five minutes, because we really do have to have that discussion about run-on sentences, okay? Okay, but actually it's lunchtime, and, um -- I know how much you hate Christmas parties -- but Ben's office is having their party. It's really important to him that I be there. Go, okay? Are you sure? Yeah, I'm positive. Go ahead. Go. Oh, thank you.Okay, sure. Thank you so much!Sure. Sure. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Okay. Thank you. Thank you! [ Band playing "good king wenceslas" ] Hi, Tom, it's Susan. I have, uh, wonderful news. I'm at the office, and I should be here until about 7:00, and then I'll be at home. You have both the numbers, so call me. Okay. Bye-bye. [ Ticking ] [ Band playing "we wish you a merry Christmas" ] [ Horns honking ] [ Beeps] You have no messages. At least you're not getting fired, dilly's writing, and I know Tom's book is gonna get published. Maybe you'll even get a bonus! I'll bet if you called Bob, he'd invite you over for Christmas. Just say you're sorry. You know you're sorry. Oh. [ Sobs ] Okay. Oh! [ Dialing ] [ Clears throat ] Bob, it's your sister suze the scrooge, and I'm calling to apologize, so... Please call me back... Goose breath. Happy? Very. Why doesn't he call? [ Indistinct conversations ] [ "Good king wenceslas" plays] Oh! Come on! It'll be fun! Walter: Susan...Susan... Hi. Hey. Glad you're still here. I thought you had banned Christmas. Well, I'm having second thoughts. Good. Give me a little kiss. Now, listen, I love the book. I hadn't planned on reading it, but once I started, I could not put it down! It's very good work. I'm very proud of you. Thank you, Walter. Thank you. Oh, and dilly's back on track. He sent me 30 pages, and they're brilliant. Oh, great. Good. Good for you. It's gonna be a great year. Walter, um... Were you gonna fire me? Absolutely. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas, Walter. Come on! Mark! Hey! Hey! You know...Oh! Here you go. Thank you so much. Listen, I never did get a chance to thank you the other day -- no, no, no. Not necessary. I calls 'em like I sees 'em. You know what I mean? Say goodbye to dorinda. No! So I hear. Really?! Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. How you doing, baby? See you later. Susan, hi! Oh! Hey, Robin. Where's Ben? He's celebrating a little late. I'm glad you decided to stay. Merry Christmas. Oh, Robin, thank you. Uh, you know, I haven't had any time to do any shopping.Don't be silly. I just saw it and thought of you. It's nothing, okay? And I spoke to Tom about the book. Oh, you spoke to him? I just got off the phone with him. He sounds so excited. Oh, good. T-That's very good.Oh, I gotta -- Oh, Susan!What? Merry Christmas. Honey, I read your book, and it's a hoot. I really loved it, and especially when he included the recipes. Gloria, I'm really pleased. Thank you very much. Now, open this when you go home. It's a little personal.Gloria, you shouldn't have. Oh, of course I should have. I get a kick out of getting the perfect gift for everybody. I start Christmas shopping January 2nd. Oh, thank you very, very much. You're welcome.Bye. Hi, Tom. It's Susan, your editor. At least I-I hope I'm still your editor. Walter loved the book, so we need to start discussing your deal. I know that you're disappointed with Susan the woman, but please return the call to Susan the editor. Tom, I'm sorry. Um...susan the woman would like a second chance, so maybe you can call her, too. Tom, uh...I miss you, so... Merry Christmas. [ Sighs ] Well done, Susan stone. What do you say we go home and open our presents, huh? Yeah! Come on. Oh! [ Laughs ] Co-o-o-ol! My god! Who wears these? And when? On Christmas, silly. Let's see what Robin and Ben have given US. Oh, my gosh -- Tiffany's. Is she crazy? Ha ha! Now you have to get a tree. [ "Deck the halls" plays ] [ Horns honking ] Susan: It's the most pathetic tree I've ever seen. Young Susan: It's better than the one that you didn'thave last year. Now continue, please. "'On dasher, on dancer, on prancer and Vixen... "'On comet, on cupid, on donner and blitzen. "'To the top of the porch, to the top of the wall. "Now dash away, dash away, dash away, all.' "and as he drove out of sight, I heard him exclaim, 'merry Christmas to all, and to all, a good night.'" [ Horns honking ] [ Child's voice echoes] Suze? [ Echoing continues] [ Singing] Suze? Merry Christmas, my suze. I love you so much. I'll be darned. [ Doorbell rings ] [ Ringing continues ] Aha! [ Laughs ] I like the outfit. Oh, god! Hey, why didn't you call me? I left you, like, a hundred messages. I was in New York. I didn't check the Connecticut machine till this morning. Oh, well, wait a minute. I thought that you had the gift. Yes, but only a teeny piece. [ Sighs ] I missed you. Me too. [ "We wish you a merry Christmas" plays ] This...is the best Christmas I've ever had. So, Santa brought you everything you wanted, Alice? You mean there isa Santa? Oh, that's a fact. Right, Bob? Oh, absolutely. I'll bet she looks just the way you did when you were little.Yeah, she does. May I propose a toast? Bob? Thank you. Glasses up? A toast. Up, up. Girls? To friends who can be family... And family who can be friends. Hear, hear! Hear, hear! Bob: Great, dilly. Merry Christmas, my precious, precious...Doodleberries. [ Indistinct conversations ] Susan: Did you go see aunt Nelly last week? Bob: Yeah, I saw her a couple of weeks ago... How is Danny? Oh, he's good... Merry Christmas, baby pru. Young Susan: Ha ha ha ha! [ "We wish you a merry Christmas" plays ]
