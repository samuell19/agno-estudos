Pleased to meet you. Two of the horses run off but that pinto you're riding hung around. - You got no idea what they were after? - No. - Offend anybody lately? - Not for five years. - Jefferson City? - No, Leavenworth. Never been in there. - They just jumped you out of the blue? - I had to get up anyway. Me, I'm riding along minding my own business. Four cowboys come by and we decide to ride together for a while, friendly as can be. Always figure you may as well approach life like everybody is your friend or nobody is. Don't make much difference. Then, in the middle of that fine pen suddenly everybody is pointing their gun but me. Guess they admired my horse. Looks like that's not all they admired. Yeap, my whole rig. I don't care much about the rest but I surely will miss that bay. At least they didn't kill me. That was right considerate, I thought. They were laughing when they left me. Thought it was real funny. I walked for a little while, but it was no use so I gave it up. Figured it's just bad luck. Looks like those boys are headed south so they weren't the same ones that jumped me. - Where you going? - Where's the pinto going? I'll get these horses tended to. I'm good for it. Just a minute dear fella, when I'm done helping the lady, I'll come here... I'll take this one. This one is $20. - How much to borrow it? - The guns are for sale. All right, what give me for that? Look, Ma. This is the man Sergeant. He claims the animal was stolen. How do I know this is your horse? Can't you see this horse loves me? I had a gal do that to me, it didn't make her my wife. On the underside of that saddle I got my name scratched. Take a look and you'll see. - And what would your name be? - Paden. P - A - D - E - N. Hello Cobb. Hello Paden. How you doing? You know this man Cobb? I surely do. Troopers, let's take a look at this saddle. All right. Move along folks, get these children out of here. And you, get some clothes on. I see you've been prospering without me. - It's been a while. - Where's the dog? Appreciate the loan. - I'm good for it. - Oh, let's talk about that. I'm looking for some men. - I've given that up. - So have I. I got a legitimate job now, I could use a guy like you. - You got a legitimate job? - Yes sir, you wouldn't believe it. You're right. Ah, this is mighty sweet Paden. I think I finally found my place in the world. Well, I'm... real happy for you Cobb. But I think I'll just keep looking for mine. He's getting out. Come on Paden, this ought to interest you. Hey, look who's here Tyree. Our old riding buddy. I invited Paden to join us but he's not having any. Where's the dog? You owe me $13. Thirteen, bad luck. I see what you like. It's mighty pretty. And bridle wise too. The only thing I lost I really cared about... except for maybe my hat. It's great one, black with a pretty silver band on it. My head spent three years training it. Sure do miss that hat. I got to be going. Going to Turley, was it? Yeah, yeah, I got to stop off there, meet a guy, head out for Silverado. What's Turley like? It's a town. Got a saloon? I expect. - Women? - I expect. Baxter, Hawley, where the hell have you been? You're late and I tell you I don't like it, it's a bad start boys. I got my people down there throwing snowballs and wearing to go. Afraid it is a bad start friend because my name ain't Baxter, he ain't Hawley. - You're not Baxter? - Name is Emmett. - You're not Baxter either? - No, I'm not Hawley. Goddamn it, they ain't Baxter and Hawley, where the hell is Baxter and Hawley? Quit yelling you old coot, we're right here. Who you calling a coot? Calm down Mr. Hobart, I'm Nord Baxter. - There's my partner, Tom Hawley. - You're late, it's a bad start boys. Yes sir, that means we just have to get you people to Silverado that much quicker. All right, let's get going. You remember my letter, don't you Mr. Hobart? Half now and half when we get there. Yeah, yeah, I remember, open the box Jeff. Thank you. - Don't you even want to count it? - Not at all friend, we trust you. Let's get this wagon train on his way to Silverado. You bet. What do you want? I haven't had a drink a slip of whiskey or slept in a bed in ten days. Give me a bottle. Hey, what are you doing, buck? Having a drink. No, you're not, get out of here. I haven't had a drink of whiskey or slept in a bed in ten days. - You ain't getting here. - Real sorry to hear that. - Don't look quite fair. - Which way you mean? What's all this then? This nigger is breaking up my place Sheriff Langston. I don't like that word much Carter. We don't serve them here and you know it. I asked him to leave and he went crazy on us. - Now he owes me money for all this damage. - Is that a fact? Afraid not Sheriff, these other fellas started the ruckus. Are these your friends? I wanted a drink and a bed. - Guess I came to the wrong place. - Came to the wrong town. I don't tolerate this kind of things, it's hard on the peace and the furniture. Now, knowing a bit about Carter here, I'll let you go without paying for the damage. But go you will and I mean now. Is there a place in town that takes my kind? You misunderstand, I want you out of town. In fact, I want you all the way out of my jurisdiction. That ain't right. I decide what's right in this jurisdiction, now move. - Hey, who's going to pay for this Sheriff? - Don't press your luck, Carter. Now, let's talk about you chaps. - We'd rather stay. - We'll see about that. I'm Sheriff John Langston, as you may have guessed I am not from these parts. You're kidding? But the good citizens of Turley have taken me in their embrace and for one simple reason, I maintain the peace. So, when strangers come to town, I always ask them their business. Have you come for the hanging? I'm just meeting a guy here and moving on. So far I haven't been able to find him. Well, in my town if you're looking for someone you ask me. All right, he's a young fella, full of juice, about my size, wears a fancy two gun rig. I know where that gentleman is. Now, I want everyone to behave himself. Emmett? - Howdy Jake. - Emmet. Oh, I'm glad to see you. Keep back. What's going on here? You got me. This is a crazy town. I think we ought to just get out of here. You know, all I did was kiss a girl. That's why they got you in jail? Yeah, I kissed a girl and, and... And this guy didn't like it, so we had some words so I decided to get out of there. So I did, I... I got out of there. You know me, I don't want no trouble. And so, I walked out in the street. And this fella tries to shoot me in the back. - You had to kill him? - No, I winged him, he's dropped his gun. You're in here for winging a guy? No, not exactly, because see, there was a friend of him. - What friend is that? - Is one with the shotgun. The dead one. Jake, Jake... I'm going to ask you once, was it self-defense? Honest to God, he would killed me. The jury saw it differently. - So he's the guy you're going to hang? - Tomorrow morning at 10 o'clock. Afraid of that. Emmett, can't you help me? You know the law Jake, you know what they did to me. Blind Pete always said you'd hang. I guess tomorrow at dawn he'll be proved right. 10 o'clock A.M. Right, always thought they do it at dawn. So long kid, I'm sorry. Hate to see any man swing, bad luck. Bad luck for me, I got to bust him out of there. You'll have to deal me out on that. Have some experience with that sort of thing. - Don't want any more. - I understand. - It's not going to be easy. - Never is, but... he's my brother. We're going to California together but... first we going to stop off in Silverado, see our sister, say goodbye. I can't show up there with a story like this. Then I guess this is where we part ways. - Sorry. - No hard feelings. Come on, buy you a drink. - You ain't got any money. - Well, you buy me a drink. You know, a good smelly saloon is my favorite place in the world. You're wearing my hat. What else you got that's mine? Mister, I don't know what you're talking about. I hope your fingers aren't tickling my ivory handled colt. If you stand up real slow and let me see you might live through this night. Sure. - Making a big mistake. - That's what I told them. You mean you ain't coming with Emmett and me? I can't say I'm convinced you're going anywhere. We sure are, we're leaving at dawn. I have no reason to run, was a fair fight and there were plenty of witnesses. - Yeah, that's what happened with me too. - The other guy drew first. Right. Hear Sheriff, open up. Sheriff Langston, come quick. Lock the door, don't let anybody in. Blind Pete used to do this all by touch. All right, where is he? - He left. - Like hell, this is the only way out. I woke up and he was gone. All right kid, come on out, I know you're under there. You, get over here. Yeah, you, get over here. Give me your hands. You get him? Thanks for giving me a hand. What now? We wait, let's go. Come on Jake, let's go. Get them at the river. Here's a trick for you kid. - That them shooting? - No, it's coming from those rocks. Well, let's go, he ain't hitting nothing. You idiot, he's hit everything he's aimed at. They won't be out of our jurisdiction until they pass Flat Top. Today my jurisdiction ends here. Pick up my hat. Hey Langston, 10 o'clock. This a friend of yours? - He is now. - Who is he? - Oh, a guy got run out of town. - Just like us. - Hobart, what you people doing here? - Look. Baxter and Hawley killed poor Eb and stole the money box. They went north, we're going after them. Forget the money, you got to get these people out of here. This is bad country, no place to be setting with women and kids. Yeah, the next water ain't for three days. We got no life now without that money. Everybody put in, that's our whole stake. - How long they've been gone? - About an hour. I'll go with you Mal. Deal me in. Jake, you know the way out of here. The way you get this train moving to Silverado and fast, I'll go with these guys. You men, stay with your wagons and your families. - Get rolling, keep your eyes peeled. - Wait a minute. Even if you do get the money, how do we know you'd come back? Well, if we don't, you can keep my brother. - I'm trusting you mister. - You trusted Baxter. I don't plan on letting these men out of my sight. You know mister... if I brought a pretty lady like that into a place like this, I'd stay close. That's none of your business, let's get going. You got a point, maybe I better stay here with her. Alright, let's get turned around and get these wagons rolling. Everybody rides, everybody rides. You know, hanging around with you is no picnic. Anybody got any ideas? - You really did it this time Nord. - Thank you boss, Tom did his part too. Coming in. - Should I kill him Mr. Dawson? - In a minute. I wouldn't do that if I were you, you going to need every gun when that posse gets here. Posse? What the hell are you talking about? Me and my partner robbed a bank in Turley, headed out with a posse on our tails. My partner over there caught one ways back and then he... kicked off us moving for this damn canyon, you Dawson, ain't you? Tex LaRue, used to ride with Ry Morris, you know him, well... Andy Simms told me there's a hideout near here so I headed for it. Hope you don't mind. Mind? You brought a posse to my best hideout and you ask me if I mind? Mister, I don't know any of those names, you're about to die. Hold on, hold on, hold on. You don't believe me, ask them two there. They saw me and my pal in Turley before we did the job. I seen him there all right, I don't know nothing about any bank job. If you took the bank in Turley, where's the money? You know, I'd get down if I were you. They might be up there right now. - No money, eh? - It's in my saddlebags. I ain't getting out in the open to get it. Stop your firing... until you see something. We charge them, we stand stand a chance but first we got to get them horses. - Horses? What the hell you talking about? - Cover me. Brave man. I think there's only a couple of guys up there and this asshole is one of them. Get that guy, keep him from getting the horses. Was some idea of yours, next time you go in. I knew it, now put that box on my horse. Mister, you got a lot to learn about people. They got a place south of Silverado, guess they've done Ok. Good enough anyway, so there my mama wrote me last time... said they needed my help to work the place. That was almost nine months ago she wrote. Letter took a while to find me but when it did it was just the right time. Where were you? Chicago, working in the slaughterhouses. Chicago? You've been in Chicago? Was it wonderful? Hey Paden... where you been? I just... checking the... You know, looking in. Geez Paden, her old man even cold yet. Looks pretty shallow here, we could just go off. Pull them up, yeah. That's all right, let them go. Bank is soft on the other side. Let's go. Well, this is it gents. My mama told me to head through that notch. Good luck Mal. Maybe we'll see you around sometime. Yeah, maybe. So long. - So long, Mal. - Bye. - See you again ma'am. - Think I'll ride along with the lady here. Take a look at this farmland before I come into Silverado. See what makes a trip this hard worth taking. I'll see you around. - I'll be around. - Hey Jake, let's go. - See you in Silverado Paden. - I'll be there. Mr. And Mrs. Parker have agreed to join their parcel to mine. We'll work them together. Mine starts right over there. It's all I've ever wanted. Pretty land, isn't it? And a pretty lady. A lot of men have told me that. Maybe it's true. I guess some women are slow to believe it. Believe it. They're drawn to me by that but it never lasts. Why? Because they don't like what I want. - What's that? - I want to build something. Make things grow. That takes hard work, a lifetime of it. That's not why a man comes to a pretty woman. And after a while I won't be so pretty... but this land will be. Come here. - Hi, J.T. - Jake, how are you? Come on son. - Remember us? - Yeah, Hi Augie. It's good to be home, Kate. Daddy? I saw the light. I thought maybe Rae had come back to see me. I never thought it'd be my boy, I never thought that. Mama? She was sick a long time. She was sick when she wrote you but she didn't say it. I never thought you'd come back but she did. - Where's Rae? - She's gone, gone to town. She hated working the farm. Just like you. - What happened? - They run me off. They burned me out. Made it so I couldn't do. Just like Georgia. You own this land. I paid the government for it alright, that don't mean much out here. Malachi, I'm living like a wildcat in a cave in them hills. Hiding out. - Afraid to walk my own land. - - What about the law? Whose law? The law here runs a man down just like these cattle. That ain't right. I had enough of what ain't right. What we got here is a bad situation. Those homesteaders you brought in are going to make it worse. When they come to this office to stake their... claims it's going to be the start of big trouble. Going to cut McKendrick off in the north. You know, a man could die of thirst before anybody offered him a drink around here. Maybe you ought to come to California with Jake and me. Augie is going to grow up here. There's nothing wrong with the land, it's just some of the people. Problem is Emmett, you killed the wrong McKendrick. Tyree, watch what you're saying around Augie, Emmett didn't kill anybody. Well Ok, it was self defense sure enough. But I do think you have to say I killed old Murdo. And I think that's definitely the word. Son is worse than the old man was, smoother so you don't hear him coming. He'll do anything to keep his range free. I'm worried what he'd going to do when he finds out you boys are back. No, I think Jake here can take care of himself. I just did five years I didn't owe. McKendrick ought to be satisfied with that, let it lie. What brings you out of your hole Johnson? - Who's that with you Ezra? - This is my son, he's come home. Ain't that sweet Red? I'm afraid you boys are trespassing on McKendrick land. You got it all wrong mister, this is our place. What? Mr. McKendrick bought this place from your father. That's a lie. Tomorrow we're going to town and straighten that out once and for all. The next day we'll be back here, farming. And them cattle better be gone. If I find any cattle on our land after tomorrow... I'm going to start carving them into steaks and believe me that's one thing I know about. Killing cattle is a hanging offense in these parts. If we shot you down right now, we'd be within our rights mister. Mister... You've ever seen what a Henry rifle can do in the hands of... somebody who knows how to use it? Who would that be? You? This ain't the end of it. What can I do you for stranger? - You work here? - I run the place. - What can I get you? - Bourbon. Right. Nifty. The world is what you make of it stranger, if it doesn't fit, you make alterations. - Drink to that, will you join me Miss... - Stella. Paden. Stella, you the Midnight Star herself? I am. I'm always there, but I only shine at night. Compliments to you Miss Stella. - This what I call a saloon. - Thanks, that's what I call it too. - And I know what I'm talking about. - You like a good saloon? It's the only place I'm happy. Me too, what's wrong with us? You wouldn't be needing any help around here? Say, with the gambling. See that fellow playing with his hair? That's Kelly, my so-called partner. - He runs that side. - So-called? Yeah. Apart from being a loudmouthed, lying cheat, he's just the man I would've picked. Why you go into business with him? I don't own this place, the man who does stuck me with Kelly. - Who's the owner? - Here he comes right now. Well, look at this. Two of my favorite people in the world talking to each other. Stella, this is one of my oldest surviving friends. - Treat him right. - That was my plan. Oh, you two are going to get along just fine, you got a lot in common. Hey Kelly, get over here. You didn't come all this way just to pay me back that money, did you? - Kelly, meet my friend Paden. - Howdy. Give the man a line of credit, he already owes the house 13 bucks. - You get a place to stay? - I just got into town. Stella, we still got that extra room out back, don't we? It's not in use at the moment. - What brings you to my saloon? - Luck, I guess. Ah, good old Paden, I was hoping maybe you change your mind about the job. You didn't tell me you own a saloon. Oh, that ain't the half my friend. Welcome to heaven. Where is the other one Johnson? Our orders are to run you two out of here. You couldn't leave well enough alone, could you old man? You tell us where your son is. There don't have to be any shooting. - You're lying Hoyt, like always. - No, not this time, I got my orders. - My son is on the way to town. - That's too bad. You're just going to have to go by yourself. Daddy? Hannah is a smart, pretty woman. - But she's got a hard idea for living. - Yeah? All I'm saying is you won't trip over me if you look her up. I'm going to California with my brother. Cobb, want you to meet Emmett, a friend of mine. - This is Sheriff Cobb. - Pleased to meet you, Sheriff. The pleasure is mine, always happy to meet a friend of Paden's. Hey Stella, bring Kelly out here, will you? - You're Kate Hollis' brother? - It's right. You the one who killed old Murdo McKendrick. I didn't have much choice, he was about to shoot my brother in the back. Can't be having that now, can we? - You want see me? - Kelly, we're going to make an adjustment. I wanted you'd be here when I offered Paden your job. I think he could do it without getting greedy. Stella and I are tired of you, skimming our profits. - What are you talking about? - I'm done talking Kelly, get out. - You can't do this. - Really? - How about taking up the job? - See you're an understanding boss. Suppose nothing like that would ever happen between us. Maybe we ought ask Stella? You'd be welcome. No Kelly, he'll kill you. Thanks for warning me. Didn't have much choice. Well, stand back. I never enjoy killing a man. Excuse me. Sheriff, I'm a gambler who'd like to run an honest game here in the town. Whom do I speak about that? Hope not this gentleman. That's him. Well, I better find somebody to clean up this mess. You used to ride with that guy? What are you doing? I told you to practice on a horse that's not moving, eh? Where you going? Well, I got things to do kid, I'm a busy man. I'll go with you. A grown man can't have a little boy with him everywhere he goes. And who's a grown man? Hello Rae. What are you doing here? - I thought you were done with our family. - Daddy is dead. - He was murdered. - Who did it? I'm not sure, but I've got an idea. When I'm sure, they going to pay. Oh, that's just fine. Where were you when Mama and Daddy needed you? It's too late Mal. Now you finally show up and all you can think is to get yourself kill. - You Ok Rae? - Yeah, I'm Ok. Introduce me your friend. He's not my friend, he used to be my brother. Calvin Stanhope, but my mother called me Slick. Excuse me. What are you doing here Rae? This ain't for you. That's none of your business. But Rae, all we got is each other. I don't have any family anymore. I'm surprised to see you out here today. - Just come out to say goodbye. - Goodbye? Yeah, Jake and me will be heading out for California soon. You came all the way out here just to tell me you're going to California? All you had to do was go, we never see each other again. - That's why I'm here. - Why? You don't make it easy on a fella. Maybe you thought you be back this way someday. Yeah, that must've been it. It's McKendrick's men, go. Move. All right, let's go. Goddamned, we won't quit, you bastards. Is that a fair mix? I'm saving lives here, straight stuff would raise a blister on boot leather. I meant it seemed like a lot of whiskey. - What's this? - That's the good stuff. Oh yeah? How good? - Here's to the good stuff. - May last a long time. You better get out here. - Nothing happened Tyree, this is my job. - Shut up. I don't believe a lady has to explain anything to a man this ugly. - What's the trouble here? - Stay out of this Paden. - He can do that Tyree, Cobb is hired him. - That's Cobb's mistake. Come out of there Phoebe, you done enough. - Go home. - All I did was kiss the girl. That you said in Turley, remember how that ended? What's the matter? Afraid I couldn't get those two behind me? I don't want you getting anybody in my place. Boom. I should've killed you a long time ago. Why not now? Don't do it Tyree. I just lost a partner, if you kill him I'll never get anyone to work in here. You better start looking. You really are a gambler, aren't you? Give me some of the good stuff. - Hold it. - Sorry about that. - Where you get this horse kid? - This is my uncle's horse. - Like hell it is. - What's the problem, Swann? Yeah, what's the problem? - Emmett. - McKendrick. - I didn't know you were out. - Seem short to you? That's all over with as far as I'm concerned Emmett, I'm satisfied. Sounds good. All right then, let's go. - Don't you recognize this pinto? - What? - That's Lee's horse. - Shut up, Swann. Wait a minute. Get down from there, Augie. The man who lost this horse must've been working for you. I should've known. But you changed your brand Ethan. A lot of things changed when my father died. - He must be pretty good. - He's good, all right. Too good for my men. That's why you got to take care of it. - What about his brother? - We'll handle that. He's careless. Things getting messy around here. - I hear Ezra Johnson got himself killed. - I heard that too. Did you hear his son is still around? Cobb, looks like you're finally going to earn your money. From what I've seen, Paden doesn't care about money. He says he doesn't care about anything, but he does. He's just no telling what it's going to be. - Howdy Mr. Slick. - Sheriff. Let me tell you about your friend Paden. Me and him, Tyree and a few others did a good bit of riding together a few years back. Business, you know, was pretty good. We were moving around a lot, the way you have to in that line of work. Somewhere along the line we picked up this dog. One of the boys took to feeding it, so it followed us everywhere. Anyway, at one time we were leaving a little Missouri town, in quite a hurry. A bunch of locals hot on our tail, this dog, somehow, got tangled up with Tyree's horse. Tyree went flying. Tyree was pretty mad when he jumped up and being Tyree he shot the dog. Didn't kill him. And before you know it, Paden is off his horse... and he's holding this dog. He got all strange, said we squaw without him. I thought he was kidding at first but he wasn't. Tyree was ready to plug them both, all this with a posse coming down. I thought we were pals after all the riding we have together. All the sudden he's more worried about some mutt. Well, we did like he asked and we left him. He went to jail for a dog. You want to hear the funny part? Paden didn't even like that damn dog. It evened out in the end. They locked me up, the dog sprung me.. Where's the dog now? He left. Come on Paden, I'll buy you a drink. I took out $13. - It's a lot of money. - Told you this was a sweet setup. It is that. Maybe you could run it without Stella. This is her life, I'll go before she does. - Easy boy, it's just an idea. - Well, thanks but forget it. Paden, what makes all this work is me doing my job.. Those fellows you come to town with are causing some trouble. It's going to take some straightening out. I have my responsibilities. I just want you to understand it has nothing to do with us. - What is it you want from me? - Nothing. Do nothing, don't be between us. I'm a great believer in doing nothing. We understand each other. Don't worry about me. If you're taking on Emmett, the last place I want to be is between you. You're empty mister. Ain't you dead yet mister? Cobb said he'd be hard to kill. I guess you couldn't hear us coming. He's practicing so hard for a fight he missed the whole thing. So long stranger. I don't want to kill you and you don't want to be dead. - He can't be that good Tyree. - You want to find out? I think we should do like he says. How you feeling? Be a lot worse if you hadn't come along. Well, I didn't just come along, I was looking for you. Jake said you out there. I saw him in town and he told me about that business the other day. He said you boys took a Henry rifle off one of McKendrick's men. - I wanted to see it. - That's it. This was my father's, the man who killed took it. I'm sorry. I got to get to my brother, they come after me, they'll want him too. - You'll never make it. - I got to. I'll go. I'll bring Jake out here. You be careful. You're in it now, it's going to get mean. Augie, I've had enough of this. Kiss your father and get in bed. - Get out, we've nothing to talk about. - Rea, I need help. - So why come to me? - Because you my sister. There's nobody else. The men who killed Daddy are after Jake, I got to talk to him. What's stopping you? They're watching the house, I can't get through. - What makes you think I could? - Why would they stop you? Because I'm your sister. He ain't in the saloon either. Where is that boy? You crazy. - Why him? - You need help, don't you? Jake said he'd meet you behind the church. Be careful, they're all over the place. - Thanks. - Good luck. You must be Ezra Johnson's boy. Don't shoot the sheriff. That's against the law. So is killing a deputy. Now, we're going to give you a fair trial. Followed by a first class hanging. Or you could ride out of here before dawn. All you got to do is tell me where I can find your friend Emmett. Why are they doing this Mal? Because they enjoy it. What happened to Emmett? Cobb's men just about killed him, that's what happened. I got there just short of too late. - Lucky. - Yeah. It's working out real good. Where's Emmett now? You're working for Cobb these days, aren't you? Your friends have been beating me to find that out. You think I'm just going to tell you? You waltzed in pretty easy. You can go out the same way. Me they figure to carry out. - Is he all right? - Looks bad Rae. He's a hard man. He won't give them what they want. - It's going to cost him. - Oh, can't you stop them? I don't think so. What is it? Oh Kate, sweet Kate. Don't. Jake is been with me all evening, I just left him. - Where is he now? - Went home. Been with you all evening? Even after Slick came to get him? Slick didn't come. Stop it. - He saw us. - Bring him with us.. Fire, the land office is on fire. Help J.T. Where's Augie? Her boy must be upstairs. No, no, they took him. They took my Augie. You go around the back of the house. Wyoming, you go over there and help out. Tom, you go to help with the buckets too. Nathan, help with that wagon. Give it up. I hate to see this kind of thing in my town. - Going to have to look into this. - Yeah, maybe I will too. - I thought we talked about that. - We didn't talk about this. They took a little boy Cobb. You still worried about the dog, aren't you? You got to calm down Paden, everything will be put straight in a few days. Yeah. I saw how you put Mal Johnson straight. Never could count on you be reasonable. Don't force me to make an adjustment around here. Cobb, you got nothing I need. I'm not thinking about your future Paden. I'm worried about Stella. What's she got to do with this? Not a thing. She's just a mutual friend. But if you wind up on the wrong side of this... she's going to get hurt. I'm trying to save you from yourself, don't change your luck. - What is it that I can't figure? - What do you mean? Cobb is got something on you and it must be pretty good. What makes you say that? If he didn't, you'd never sit still with all this going on. You sure? Maybe that's kind of friend I am. What's he got? Cobb says there's no telling what you're going to care about. Is that what he said? Oh, he figured it Ok this time. Look who's here Johnson, your sweet little sister. Maybe I better search her, won't be easy, you know? Only got one good hand. Garth, you in there Garth? To my Midnight Star. Cobb is using me to stop you. So good people are being hurt because of me. That makes me mad. Some people think because they're stronger or meaner they can push you around. I've seen a lot of that. But it's only true if you let it be. The world is what you make of it. I like your attitude but it can be risky. I'm ready for that, what about you? I don't want you to get hurt. He can't hurt me if he's dead. Stella, come quick. She sprung her brother all by herself and this is what happened. - He brought her here. - Where he go? I told him about Jake and the little boy, he went out after Emmett. Stop you crying, go get Doc Skinner and bring him to the shed. Pick her up, I got a place to hide her. You better get in there with her until this thing is over. Where's Jake? - McKendrick's men got him. - Is he alive? It's worse than that Emmett, they took him at your sister's house. Her husband was shot, I don't know if he's going to make it. - Kate? - She was hurt. Pretty bad. They took the little boy with them. - Put on one of these. - This ought to do. Garth? Fox. Get Kyle and Dusty over here and keep your eyes open. We're running out of deputies. Stampede. Turn them around. Go. - Augie, where's Jake? - He's dead. What? Was trying to get away, fell off his horse... - off a cliff. - Jake fell off his horse? All right. - Yeah, where's Emmett? - Inside. - Where you've been? - Playing dead. - Let's get out of here. - Right. - Jake. - Uncle Jake. Hi guys. Come on Augie. Come on Augie, jump, come on. He's on the roof, Paden. - It never should've got this far Cobb. - This is as far as it's going. Well, I'll do my part but you better watch your ass. These guys will shoot it off. I'm going to enjoy this. It used to be a peaceful town. - What's going on Sheriff? - Hide and watch. Everybody off the streets, there's going to be trouble. - Any sign of Stella? - Been looking. - And see if you can find Rae. - Yeah. You wait till we get back, don't come in. See you around. Last one to the Midnight Star buys. You're on. Let's get them. Hey, Paden. Good luck. I'm going for the doctor, you're going to be all right. Don't be afraid Rae. I'll stay with you until your little friend comes back. Come on out boys, Jake is in town, let's start the ball. Mal. I'm glad you're here, I've been watching her but she needs a doctor. Yeah. Looking for this? It's all right, I'm here now. What a waste. This could've been such a sweet deal for us. Yeah, bad luck. - Goodbye Cobb. - Goodbye Paden. To California. - Got to go. - Right. - You take care of yourself, you hear? - You too. Jake, Paden. - Come on Molly. - Bye. Bye-bye. Weren't you going to come out and say goodbye? Already did that. - You know where I'll be. - Yeah. - So long Paden. - So long Jake. - Say, you might make a farmer yet. - I got a job. Let's get going. - Take care of your folks. - I will. We'll be back.
