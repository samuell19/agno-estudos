Dear Nick, He has been sold. To a club in Amsterdam. He likes little boys now too. Dear Nick, He starved to death. That is the truth. The truth, my esteemed Nick... He lived in a caravan all those years. As my lover. Plettinckx! Plettinckx! If I see you at my house one more time, I'm going to get you. You bastard! I'm going to fucking get you! THE TREATMENT 9 Hert Road. Mr Simons has been taken to hospital, Mrs Simons is currently receiving treatment on the spot. Someone saw a man run into the park behind the house. The perpetrator may still be in the park with the child. Robin! Robin! The park behind the house has been cordoned off. Local teams are there. Robin! Let go of me! Christ. They found the mother in here. The doctor says another twelve hours and they'd have been dead. The father was handcuffed to that pipe there. The child was probably tied to that stove. We think the perpetrator took the child with him when he fled. A neighbour saw a figure heading for the park. And he probably escaped this way. That blood is still fresh. It could be the child's, eh? - Yes. Sorry. Danni speaking. Sir? Hey, you! Come away from there, sir. I can keep what I find, eh? Have you seen a little boy, about 9 years old, who's been hurt? No, I haven't seen a little boy. - Have you got your ID card on you, sir? Nick? Coordination briefing at the station. - But he's still in the park. 8 teams are searching. I need you at the briefing. This is Golf 1-2. We think we've seen a heat source. Where? Where? - 60 metres from the open-air theatre. Golf 1-2. Can you come lower? - Message received. We'll try. We can't see anything now. - We have to carry on looking. Heat source negative. We'll extend the search area further. - Bloody hell. Bloody hell. Bloody fucking hell. Bloody hell. Red paint diluted with urine, according to the lab. Female toxin. That must mean something to someone. Search your databases. Not a word to the press. We'll use this 'female toxin' to weed out the jokers and the loonies. My first thought was a loony though. We'll see who's been released from psychiatric hospital but mustn't just look at psychiatric cases. It can have been made to look like the work of a lunatic to mislead us. Or in order to be able to plead insanity. Imprisoning three people for three days is controlled, planned. Arrange things at home for the next few days. Be back by 5:30. To search the park with a fine-tooth comb and to go door to door. OK? Can you search for intruder, abduction, handcuffs, child aged between 5 and 10? Keep sexual offenders separate. Nick? The hospital called. We can't talk to the Simonses. He has a tube in this throat and she is sedated. They'll call us as soon as there is any change. Get a few hours' sleep. Sleep? - Come on. Get some sleep. Sir? - Oh, Rudy. You can't go in there. - Police. I've received strict orders. Mrs Simons is sedated... Mrs Simons' child is missing. I doubt she'll mind if we wake her up. Which bit of no don't we understand? I'll wait there. Hello? Is there any news? - Yes, Mr Simons is out of danger. But you can't talk to him, he still has a tube in his trachea. Is his wife awake? She has just discharged herself. A friend picked her up. And you just left me there? I thought you knew. A policewoman was with her. Bloody hell! Did we send anyone to collect Mrs Simons from hospital? Where to? Good morning, madam. Chief Inspector... - Come in. She's upstairs in the spare room. She is in a bad way. She's distraught. You can go on up without me. Thank you. In there? Mrs Simons. Chief Inspector Cafmeyer, Federal Police. We are doing all we can to find Robin as fast as possible. The doctor needs to come back. I want something stronger. - We'll sort that out for you. Could we first go over what you can remember? I don't remember anything. Only what I told that woman. I didn't feel very well after dinner. Alex was playing on the Playstation with Robin in the cellar. I think I fainted. Because I woke up in that cupboard. I was handcuffed to that pipe. No one called round until Monday? - Everyone thought we'd gone to the seaside. We were supposed to leave on Saturday for the weekend. Then you woke up. And then? I was woken up by snuffling noises outside the cupboard. Like an animal makes. A dog? - No. At the top of the door. That wasn't a dog. Apparently you didn't see the intruder. Did he ignore you for three days? Yes. I could hear him coming in and out using the key. Did you hear your husband and your little boy? Our Robin was screaming. He was screaming. Did you hear anything else? I, uh... I saw a light flashing under the door. A torch? - No, it was a flashlight. From a camera? And I just sat there. Like a coward, scared shitless. You mustn't say that. I've seen your medical file. You almost pulled your hands off trying to get to Robin. Scared shitless, like a coward! I just sat there. - Mrs Simons... Like a coward, scared shitless! The troll did it. He looks down at you from a tree when you're asleep. And the troll came down out of his tree and took him away. Anahid? Get in your bed. Now. Take this, it brings good luck. Then you can say a little prayer for him. OK. You're late. I went to see the mother, Cindy Simons, at a friend's house. A strange woman. Did you find anything else out? - Photos may have been taken. You can go door to door along the east side of the park, in that new neighbourhood. Excuse me, madam. - Yes? Chief Inspector Cafmeyer, Federal Police. May I ask you a few questions? Yes, of course. Come in. Sorry about the smell. The builders must have used the ventilation pipe as a toilet. Tara, are you coming? Come on. Come on. That is Joff. And Tara. Tea or coffee? - Um, coffee, please. Do any other people live here yet? - No, we're the first ones. We only moved in a week ago, so... Joff? Where is the milk? - I don't know. Have you been feeding stray cats again? - No. I know you've only just moved in but have you noticed anything unusual? No. Apart from my milk being stolen. Are you from the police? Have you come to catch the troll? The troll who climbs the wall... Go and wash your hands. - He really does exist. Wash your hands. - He does, he eats kids. He doesn't exist. Go and wash your hands. Sorry. Uh... no, nothing unusual. A great view from here. - Yes. You were in the park yesterday evening? - Yes, I was in the park. You didn't see anything unusual? - No. Just some policemen. Pardon? - Lots of policemen in the park. Right. Should you remember anything, you can phone me. I can find my own way out. Thank you. Whatever I find I can keep. Whatever I find I can keep. Well? Did you find anything? - No, not really. Just something about female toxin. - Oh? That looks very scientific. - It's an article from the sixties. About how prolactin can harm the environment. And prolactin is? - It says it's a female hormone. A weapon of mass destruction. Where did you find it? - In an American blog from Mississippi. There's something else I'd like you to try before you go. Search the files for the word troll. Troll? It's something kids believe in. Something they frighten each other with. I know, it may be clutching at straws but... Nick... This disappearance is very similar to what happened to your brother. I wouldn't want you to end up being overwhelmed by it. I know how far you always go. - I know my limits, Danni. Alex Simons is off the ventilator. I must say, I was amazed. Three days without water. Hardly any signs of dehydration. Talk about strong. Twenty minutes max. Mr Simons, Commissioner Petit, Chief Inspector Cafmeyer. We're sorry about what happened to your son. We're doing our best to find him. I know it isn't easy, Mr Simons, but it would help the investigation if you told us everything you can remember. Maybe we can start with how the intruder got in. Perhaps you can give us a description? Age? Height? Skin colour? Hair colour? Don't look at me like that, pal. - What? I don't like your eyes. If you want to help your son, think about the intruder's eyes instead of... He wore dirty white trainers, no special brand. His trainers? Is that all? - Yes. He was in the cellar playing on the Playstation with his son. At half past six he went upstairs to help his wife pack for the weekend. He was hit on the head. He woke up blindfolded, handcuffed and gagged. End of story. That's a very short story. Did he hear the window smash? - He says not. He heard the intruder come and go and he sometimes heard his wife crying. Just his wife? - He didn't hear his son anymore. He fainted Monday around midday. Around midday. So he could keep an eye on the time? It seems the blindfold let daylight through. Did he see a flashlight flash? - No. No? His wife was very adamant about that. He won't tell you more than he told me. Mummy? Mummy? Mummy? What's the matter? - There was a troll. There's no such thing. You're getting too hot in your pyjamas. Take them off. No, Mummy. He was there at the window and he looked at me. Trolls can't climb that high. Shall I take a look? Come here. Give me a hug. You really scared him. I think he's run off. Come and see. No trolls. Eh? Have you cleaned the windows? - No. We've only been here a week. It's from a workman who put the window in and forgot to wipe his handprint off. Anyway, the hand was upside down. Hey? - Yeah. I'll be glad when we're in Brittany. Happy birthday, Nick. What better birthday present can I give you... after 25 years... than the truth... about your little brother? Not because I feel sorry for you. Or regret what I did. Because everything he has done for me and with me, time after time after time, he did because he loved me. Forget all the explanations I've given you up till now. Because soon you will know the absolute truth. God bless us all. Ivan Plettinckx. Bjorn? Bjorn? Bjorn? Bjorn? Alex Simons discharged himself from hospital. When? - After we left there. He's gone to be with his wife at that friend's house, Mrs Nercessian. I'm going to help search the park. - We're pulling out of the park. I've extended door-to-door enquiries. And we're appealing for witnesses. But he's still there. I want to take a dog team into the park. I said we've finished in the park. - I mean cadaver dogs. Rigor only present in the face and upper torso. Mouth and nose: dry scabs. Skin taut. Histology: check for hyperkaelemia. I want sodium level, concentration of the antidiuretic hormone and plasma. Discolouration of larynx may indicate strangulation with a ligature. No petechia in the eyes. Strangulation is not the cause of death. What is then? A dentist needs to look at this. Have they finished? - No. I've just come from the parents. I heard it was you who suggested looking in the trees. Yeah. In Bjorn's case they never... Well. Nick... you don't believe there's a connection? Eh? Do you? Is there a time of death? - We have to wait for the lab report. And was he... - Sexually abused? Yes. There was bleeding in the rectum and sperm was found on the swab. Thanks. Julie? When can we have the DNA? - In 48 hours. What? - I can't promise it any sooner. Who knows what that bastard may do in 48 hours? I want to start comparing it tomorrow. - Who with? All the paedophiles in the country? - No. Just those who've been in prison. A belt round the neck, biting the shoulder, that's a prison rape. Shit! Dammit! - What's the matter? I forgot to cancel the caterer. He's outside my house. I didn't tell those I'd invited either. - You have to wait for the lab. Come on, birthday boy. Nick! Happy birthday. No, no, no. Bloody hell! That's where Bjorn ran away, at the back through the bushes. Plettinckx was the main suspect right from the start. They arrested him but they had to let him go. I think he just enjoys screwing me around. I've told you often enough. Sell this place. Before something happens. It has started escalating recently. It has something to do with the Simons case. He knows something or is involved. That paedophile network is like mould. It spreads under the ground. It connects all the perverts. Plettinckx's virile years are over. How old is he, 65? That doesn't matter these days. There's viagra. He knows something. He knows something or knows someone who knows someone else. Let me question him. - Stay far away from him, d'you hear me? We'll compare his DNA, if you'll sleep better. That's what really matters, eh? Me sleeping enough. So I'm able to get another kid down from a tree! Herman from the lab won't take the bones. He says they're pig's bones. Thanks. This will be the hobby room. - All you need now is a hobby. And this is the bedroom. Oh no. I don't believe it. Joff has let Tara come upstairs again. Does she do that often? - Yes, she has done recently. Always on my side of the bed, never a drop on Hans's side. Keep nice and straight. Are you alright, Iris? That child died of thirst. Up that tree. He lay there suffering for two days before he died. He hadn't finished. He was probably interrupted and fled into the park with Robin. He had to hide him and leave him there. He's going to do it again. Is that the search result for troll? Yes, it's an unsolved case from the nineties. That's the number of the inspector on the case. He's retired now. There. That's the file. Morckhoven Avenue. November '97. These maybe. They're the only things worth looking at. They were found in the litter bin in that street. Blurred photos. - Yes. His own mother wouldn't recognise him in those. Anyway, we didn't get any reaction in relation to them. No one was reported missing either. Where did the word troll come from? There was an anonymous phone call. Some really confused guy who was clearly drunk. He started crying, saying his wife had left him, had deserted him and that the boy in the photo was his son. And that the troll had done it. Done what? - He didn't say. Did the name Ivan Plettinckx come up at any time during the investigation? Plettinckx? If that's a paedophile from the area then we certainly screened him. We screened lots of them back then. Yes, here, look. Plettinckx. Interviewed, no further action. Is he a suspect? ONCOLOGY DEPARTMENT IVAN PLETTINCKX... LUNG CANCER... ...SPREAD TO... OPERATION IS POINTLESS. Could you stay outside? This is rather private. You promised to tell the truth. You promised. You promised. What do you want to know? Let's start... with the troll. You mean... the biter. Wouldn't you rather know something about... about your little brother? You should get your priorities right, Cafmeyer. What about the biter? What do you know? Tell me what you know. Come a bit closer. Bastard. What do you know? - That I can screw you around. Everything is in the car, so we can go. Joff? Put your shoes on. And turn the TV off. We're going. Mummy! Mummy! Mummy! Mummy! Mummy! No! Mummy! Iris speaking. Nick, I've got Quireynen on the line. The DNA. I'll start matching it. We did our best but the sperm sample came back with 'no profile'. It was a very delicate sample. There's a procedure to replicate it up to 34 times but that takes a lot of time and lab capacity and I doubt... Is it the same old story? A load of crap about budgets? Permission... Permission? Do I have to ask Robin's parents for permission? Permission... - Do I have to come and make you do it? But permission has been given. And we've started but I doubt it will work. OK, I'm calm. Alright. Joff! Joff! Tara? Tara? Tara? Tara. Tara. Tara, come here. Tara. Tara, don't. Tara, come here. Come on, it's OK, it's OK. It's OK. Where are his clothes? BIRTH/DEATH ACCOMPLICES Nancy? Nancy? - Who is it? Nancy Lammers? I got your address from a friend of your brother's, of Ronny's. Which friend? - A pal from in prison. Ivan Plettinckx. Bloody cop! Stop it. I just want to talk to you. - I don't talk to cops. Fuck off! You touched my tits! You tried to rape me! Don't provoke me. Don't provoke me! Calm down. Calm down. Plettinckx is probably involved in the abduction and murder of a little boy. What do you know about it? What do you know about it? - I don't know anything. Ronny knew Plettinckx. All of them... him and his lousy friends. Was there a biter among those lousy friends? Eh? Someone who restrains little boys with his teeth? A biter, Nancy? - I don't know any biters. The Plettinckx I know wasn't a biter. Just a dirty old man. So you do know him? Did you ever see or make a video in which a little boy... in which a little boy abducted by Plettinckx was abused? Bjorn. - What is all this? First you go on about a biter. Then you talk about films from a hundred years ago. This isn't the last you've seen of me. - Fuck off! Calm down, calm down. It's OK. It's OK. Nick isn't in? - I can't reach him. I haven't seen him but my number plate register was open. What is that? - I don't know. It was lying here. Help! Help! Help! Help. Help! Nick? We're on to something. The bite gave us a clear impression of the teeth. Male, older than 20. Mrs Nercessian is waiting for us. Alright. I'd like to have a more precise picture of the Simons family, starting with Alex. Alex, the poor guy. He spends all day wandering round the park. Hasn't Alex got a job? How does he earn a living? I don't know if I should tell you. Alex was at loggerheads with lots of families after marrying an odar. What is an odar? Well, Cindy is an odar. You too, in fact. It's someone who isn't Armenian. Is Alex Simons Armenian? His grandfather and mine fought the Turks together. Simons isn't an Armenian name. Simonian is. That's his name in Armenian. In our community in Antwerp lots of Armenians have changed their surname. Simonian? - Yes. Stay here. Simonian, Alerian. The guy was in prison for two years for the indecent assault of a minor. We should have checked. - He was the victim, half-dead. I should have checked. - Did he tie himself up? It's possible. First his feet, then his hands. And hit himself over the head? - That head wound was only superficial. We need the guy's DNA and an impression of his teeth. Can you call the lab for the DNA? Is Alex Simons at your place? No, he's probably in the park or at his own house. He's finding it hard to cope. - Thank you. I've seen you in the paper. You're investigating that case. If you'll excuse me, I'm busy. Maybe we could... I've got a theory. The Simons family was about to go away for the weekend. You should ask yourself if that is relevant. - We already have. Oh, OK. - Will you excuse me? I was Robin's swimming teacher. Have you got information about Robin? No. Um... has anyone said anything about a troll? What? - The children are talking about one and I wondered if the police knew. Has one of your pupils seen a troll? Come into contact with it? No, but... they talk about one. He climbs the wall at night and looks in through their bedroom window. Right. Well... I'd be happy to have you write all that information down. Feel free to contact us. If you'd excuse me, I'm working on a theory of my own. But the troll... - Please stay behind the tape. Typical of the police. They always have theories. But if someone else has... I'd like you to stay behind the tape. - They have to be Mr Big. That's it, don't listen to someone who maybe knows something. I don't feel well. I can't stand things in my mouth. We need that impression. To eliminate suspects. It won't take long. - Do I have to explain in Armenian? Do you want to find your son's murderer or not? Don't waste your time then. You've wasted enough time already. What if another family is tied up somewhere? Have you thought about that? What are you saying? What are you trying to say? The alginate is ready. - He has to answer first. It has to go in now, it hardens immediately. Open your mouth. OK. Take it easy. Take it easy. It only takes a minute. Breathe through your nose. Breathe calmly through your nose. What was that about another family? He needs to go to hospital. I have to do the right thing. I have to do the right thing. According to the lab, the DNA matches that of Alex Simons. So his story about an intruder is nothing but a lie. We need to check if there is any history of abuse. We'll contact Robin's teachers, doctors, friends. Let me deal with Simons. We will deal with him but he's too weak now. He's not going anywhere. Now he's weak is a good time. He wandered round that park for days. Go to that park. Ask if anyone saw him there and where and what he was doing. I'm an Indian. I'm an Indian. - Later. Later. Do you remember the bad guy? The bad guy who broke your head? Ivan. - Ivan, yes. Ivan and the rest? PI... Plet... Plettin... - Plettinckx. Ivan Plettinckx. Who took you in afterwards? - Nancy. Nancy. Yes. As long as you know. If anyone ever asks you, never forget to tell them who saved you. Eh? Who saved you? Nancy. - Nancy. Ronny and Nancy. Remember that. Yes. Where is my Indian? I washed your Indian. You have to stay here in this caravan for a bit longer. I'm expecting some visitors at home. I need to speak to Alex Simons. No visitors. Mr Simons has a stomach ulcer. Just one minute? - He's developed peritonitis. He's full of antibiotics and Dr Devriendt left explicit instructions. You've just arrived, eh? Has your shift already started? Maybe you haven't read those instructions yet. I really do need to speak to Alex Simons. He knows something. It's so we can prevent it happening to another child. Stop lying, pal. Listen carefully. I can't allow it to happen to another child, so if you know something or are hiding something, now is the time to say. Bloody hell. Tell me. Tell me then. Sorry, I got caught in the bag of blood. It's OK. I just... Leave, now! - No, he's going to say something. No. - Say it. Out. - He's going to say something. Sir! Get out! Fuck you. He needs blood. - He was going to say something. I've got what you want to know. I want the videos and something else. It's too late. We've found the biter without you. I know something about the other boy you referred to. He came on the scene later. Hey! Come on then, tell me. What do you know? Eh? What do you know? Who are you working for? - What do you know? You're working for someone. Who is so interested in Plettinckx's toy boy? That's none of your business. - Someone really, really wants to know. And if someone really, really wants to know... there is money to be made. In your dreams. In your dreams! - 5,000 euros. And I'll tell you everything. D'you know what I'll do? I'll gift-wrap those videos and give them to Vice. That's what I'll do. 5,000 euros and the videos disappear. Fuck off. - You don't know what you're missing. I can show you, you stupid dickhead. Nancy? Nancy? 3,000. Bloody hell. I want to go home. - Later. I want to go home. I want to go home. - Later. The visitors are coming. I want to go. - Calm down, calm down. Later. Let's play a game first. A game. Houdini, yes. Houdini. Yes. Houdini. Put your hands like this. Here we go... Houdini. Houdini. Houdini. Houdini. And if you're good, someone will come specially to see you. Specially to see you. Right, now try to get out of that. Nick? You've helped us arrest someone who had the Vice Squad tearing their hair out. Almost all computers seized from paedophiles had the same commercial for Larry Films on them. The only clue is the tattoo on the slut with the boys. We never found her. Or those films. But you have, apparently. I found that heart in Plettinckx's letters. I thought it may have something to do with Bjorn. You checked her brother's number plate. Was that in the letter too? It's a dead end. The guy is... he is literally dead. If you're working on something, Nick, don't exclude me. I mean it. - OK. You didn't call me. We had DNA quicker, the teeth impression was no longer necessary. You can still invoice us. Don't I have to look at anything? The impression of another set of teeth? Not for now. The DNA was very clear... Alex Simons. Simons? Really? So who bit the boy? What do you mean? - It certainly wasn't Simons. I managed to save some of the impression he spat out. It definitely doesn't match that bite. Alex Simons didn't bite him. The guy is still out there. Danni... So this was his lair. I saw the rubbish but was looking for a kid. No one mentioned food leftovers. Christ. What have we done to Alex Simons? Nick... It could be true. That the guy climbs walls and stares in at kids. Are we back to the troll? - Someone told me about it in detail. Check who was Robin's swimming teacher. - OK. Nick, someone called Chris Gommaer works at the swimming pool. The court has forbidden him to contact his young son. He lives in Morckhoven Avenue. Like in that old case. Mr Gommaer? It's alright, madam. I've come to see him. Come on. Come on. Get out of the water. That's him, eh? That's your son. That's Kenny, isn't it? If your wife asks for you to be kept away from your son and the court agrees, there must be a reason. Eh? I'm not a paedophile. Kenny is the person I love most in all the world. What would you call someone who rapes children then? He made me. - What? He made me. Who? - The troll. Where is he? Is he inside you? We were ready to leave. All packed. Then he came in. Via the roof. Do you know him? - He's back. That was him. In Robin Simons' house. That was him. Alex... what happened at your house? We think we know but we want you to tell us. We've found another victim. He's told us everything. Were photos taken in your house too? I can understand it isn't easy. I hope it happens to you one day. I really do. That you have to make the same choice. What choice, Alex? What choice? He held a knife here. On... On Robin's stomach. He was going to fillet him like a fish. It would have been better if he'd killed us all. What those people have been through... Then we turn up and drag them through it again. I don't know if I believe he was blindfolded the whole time. He remembers a lot of details. But if he was, Gommaer was the only one to have caught a glimpse of this troll. That was ten years ago. We're no closer to finding him. Frank, just one minute? - You know it's not allowed, Nick. One minute? Come on. - Quickly then. Really quickly, eh? This isn't because of me. OK? You gave them the videos. - They've got nothing. Just an old film from the internet. - Yeah, right. Come here. You have to believe me. I was on my way to see you, with money. Really. Come on, give me something. What do you know about the biter? The biter? I thought you had him? Give me something. A description. An age. Unmanageable. Bites. Pisses everywhere. Plettinckx only had him with him once. But what he looks like now... I know more about the other one. Do you want to know about him? Come on, Nick, finish it. We need to... - Yeah, right away. I'll see if those videos don't surface first. I'm in court in two days' time. If they've only got that old commercial, they'll let me go, eh? Otherwise... Shame. Come on, Nick. That's it. We're off. - Shame. Nick? - A real shame. Fuck. Nancy! Nancy! Nancy! I know where the smell of urine in the Simonses' house came from. Those red areas are sources of female hormones. That's the cupboard. I think he disinfected them with his own piss. Look. In this they say female hormones cause impotence. Could that be his motive? Maybe bigger or... a nose that... I can't see it there. I... Did he touch your son himself? - He couldn't. He was impotent. - Why didn't you report this? My wife thought that... it was better for Kenny. That he isn't constantly... That he isn't constantly reminded... But it didn't stop her taking him I don't know where. But maybe... maybe that is a good thing. Because... only a sick pervert would make that choice, a normal person would... - What? Let his child die? That's not a choice. - He would have done it. He had used the same knife to... slash a policewoman open once. That's what he said. I... I thought that maybe he was arrested after that, because I combed the papers for years to find something that resembled, if even only slightly, what... what happened to us... Nothing. I'll be back. Iris? Can you start your system up again? - OK. Look for convictions for stabbing a policewoman, go back to 2000, 2001. Hans! Hans! Hans! Hans! Where is Joff? Joff... Joff! Joff! I've got a name. The guy was sectioned. Bloody hell. Right under our nose. Come on. Police. Claeren? Pateet, call the lab. Wait downstairs by the lift. And someone by the stairs. PROLACTIN - FEMALE TOXIN IMPOTENCE IS AN ATTACK B Y THE FEMALE HORMONE STOP MEDICATION START OWN TREATMENT Danni? I don't believe it... I want to see the cellar. - Christ. Oh God. That's all piss. They're clothes. Bloody hell, the disgusting bastard! Patient fixated on delusion that he is a new variety. The new stage in the evolution that no longer has man's weaknesses. He sees his impotence as an attack by female hormones to prevent evolution. Prolactins are female toxin. It's heavy, falls to the ground. Everything was up off the floor in his apartment. It's the highest building, the highest apartment in the area. He'd hidden Robin up high in a tree. Hold on, that can't be Robin. Robin was tied to a stove. Bloody hell, look at that date. Alex? Ale... What are you doing here? You have to help me. Another family is now going through the same hell. You have to help. You are the only one who can help me. Why do you think he chose you? Why you? Why your family? Why? Did you notice anything? In recent weeks, recent days. Something. Anything. Come on. The smell in the house. The smell of... of piss and something rotting. And... the bottles of milk kept disappearing and we would find them right at the bottom of the garden. No. I can't. No! Hans? No. Take his underpants off. Take his underpants off. - I can't. Take his underpants off, I said. - I can't. Now take your trousers... - No. Take your trousers off. Put it in him. No. - Put... No. I can't do that. - Put it bloody in him. I can't do it. - Put it in him, I said! I can't do it. I can't do it. No. No. No. - Joff? Joff? No! Prolactin, Goddammit! Prolactin. Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! You bastard! Help! Help!

They are enough to ensure Nancy Lammers won't be released for the time being. You frighten me sometimes. Plettinckx wanted me to find them. He led me to them. He wanted me to see, to know. She wanted... She wanted those videos. She wanted money. Then she'd show me stuff. Do you know about Bjorn now? I've had enough. I'm selling my house. It stops here. Nancy! Nancy!
