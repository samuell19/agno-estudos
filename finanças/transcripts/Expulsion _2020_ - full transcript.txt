- If we stabilize it. Manual energy flow. Here goes nothing. Oh, man. - Yeah? - Vince, hey, you're never gonna... - You know what time it is? Dude, it's like... - I know, I know it's late. How fast can you get here? - You interrupted a perfectly good card game. - Come on man, this is big. - Are you wearing pink too? - It's orange. - All right, all right, show me. So? - I did it. - Did what? It? Scott, you're not supposed to run anything without me, that's our rule. - Yeah, yeah, I know. Listen, I pushed the magnetic fields past 11 Teslas, and stabilized the proton trajectory. I was able to beat the 13 teraelectronvolt record exponentially. - Hello? Two people present for all experiments. Blow up the world is an actual theoretical possibility. We don't know if this thing is an unwieldy microwave or a black hole planet destroyer. Two people. - Actually, we know now. Look. Look for yourself. I've used four sensors to measure gravity and atmospheric pressure at four points in the room. Look at those spikes, Vince. It's four and a half seconds. - Is this real? Scott, is this really real? - It's really real. - Really real? Like, you're not messing with me at all in this? - We did it. Okay. - You're sure you're not messing with me? - We did it. - Let's power this bad boy up, I wanna see it. - That's the problem, that was the four and a half seconds. - Not enough power. - It created a tear, but it was too much heat. The power we had stored wasn't enough to keep it open and stable, much less investigate it safely. - Four and a half seconds. We gotta find a sustainable power source that can keep this thing open longer. - Did you use my coordinates? - 4.994. - And a whole bunch of zeroes? - And a whole bunch of zeroes. - What did you see? - This room. Different. - What if we find dinosaurs? Scott, everyone's gonna want one. No more trash cans. You have one of these in your kitchen, you just throw your garbage through. - Probably just stretched every law of physics beyond its known limitation, and your first thoughts are dinosaurs and waste management? - Just admit that you're curious too. Dinosaurs! - When do we tell Cicero Market Tech? They have deep pockets, and a hunger for this sort of thing. They can fund us. I'm thinking money Scott. No. We can't, not yet. We need to show we can open this thing and keep it stable. We need to get a blue core battery from them first. You want to steal a top secret cryonic battery from Cicero? From our place of employment? The very batteries we are using on a project that we are actually being paid to work on? Nevermind if they even notice, it's only like 12 batteries exist in the entire world. - Yes. Cryonic batteries are designed to power an entire cryogenic pod bay for a century. - Yeah, and keeping people frozen for a long time is a far cry from smashing God particles to create doorways to other dimensions! - Which we just said, by the way. - This is so cool. - We can't go any further without them. - Okay. I might have an idea. I think Lennon may have already lifted one. - Lennon? Why? - Who knows why. But he may have sort of bragged about having one once. - He's been weird lately. - Yeah, no kidding. But if he has one. - It's not stealing if it's already stolen. - Hi there, friends, and welcome to The Daily Do. Thank you for spending just four minutes of your day with me and hopefully I can help make your lives a little easier. On today's episode, I'm gonna show you a few tricks on how to remove ants from your home without any poisons or sprays. This is particularly beneficial. Hi. - Did I just mess up your video? - Yeah, it's okay. You running late? - Yeah, I'm about to be. - How late were you and Vince up last night? - Well. I think we did it. - Can you show me? - Tonight. After work, maybe, I need one more thing. Love you. - Love you. - Cicero Market Technologies is not only the best in the world, We're the only ones breaking these scientific barriers. Our reputation always makes sure that we come to market first. So please, give me a time-frame and make it aggressive. - The problem is time. Until we can successfully put somebody under ice for longer than 96 days, we'll never truly know what damage the cryo process causes. - Dr. Normus. We hired you to create a long-term storage environment for our clients. If you had done your job correctly from the beginning, there wouldn't be any safety concerns. - We're still trying to find a way to safely take measurements from the inside, so that. - What about the trials? - Sir, results are within parameters. But again, nothing's made it past the 96-day threshold yet. - Tell me why. - Because after 96 days, they can't remember their own names. - The preservation units themselves are being damaged by the process. We need more time. - When? - Two years. - Dr. Lennon, do you agree? - Shit! So close. What was your question, Miss Fanning? - Do you agree with Scott's estimation of this taking one to two years before we can go to market? - Scott's right. We can spend a year figuring out the measuring logarithms, but the hardware as it is now can't survive the freeze. We already know that. Priority one may be to keep the client stable, but that won't matter if we can't monitor from the inside. - Do you need additional resources? - One of those really expensive espresso machines in the lounge would be fantastic. - Are we disrupting your day, Dr. Lennon, because I fail to find the humor here. - I'm making a point. Throwing more money at this won't cause the necessary technological changes to just appear. The time it takes is the time it takes. And you don't pay me to rush. - I'm beginning to question why we pay you at all. - Because I'm Bob Lennon. And the only effectual cryotician in the world who speaks English. If you want to go public now, fine. But tell NASA and your billionaire clients that you can put someone in cryo-stasis, but after three months they may, I don't know, die. - Put that on a brochure. - Fine. You have one year. But I'm growing very impatient. Dr. Lennon. I'm really beginning to question the importance of your role here. - The other divisions are years behind us. I'm your golden goose. Cicero will be first. - You have no idea how easily you can be replaced. - All right, listen. You guys are all brilliant. Give us results. Thank you, Dr. Lennon. - My pleasure. - Gentlemen. Is there anything you'd like to add? - No, sir. - What's Project Milestone? - Where'd you hear this name? - Overheard someone. - There are no other projects that require your attention except the one you're currently on. Thank you, gentlemen. - You know they need to steal from us. - Of course I know that. But it has to be this way. And it has to be them. - It's always them. - You sure this is Lennon's place? - Pretty sure. I was here like two nights ago. We play poker on Tuesdays. - Lennon? He hates gambling. He hates people. - He changed his mind? - Something changed. If you two are so chummy, why don't you just ask him for the thing? - Hell no! He's got a crazy short fuse. He's like the world's scariest math teacher. Hey Lennon, you know that thing that you stole from work? Can I have it? - I can't believe we're doing this. - Not stealing if it's already stolen. - You know that's not actually true, right? - Think you can hurry that up a little bit? What? So you were James Bond in another life? Is that real money? What, you're a hotshot card player now, too? - You check that side. - Come on, where is it? Why does he have the blueprints for a Large Hadron Collider? - How pissed do you think he'll be when he finds out we've that we scaled that down to fifty feet in your garage? - I don't think he'll be very pissed at all. - Ha. Got it. Why the fuck does he have that? - These are all the parts to a particle accelerator. Why would he have this? Did you tell him what we're working on? - Me? No, did you? - No of course not, Vince. What the hell is going on? - You stupid son of a bitch. You brought this upon yourself. - No wait, where are you going? - He's gone. - You don't know that. - He's gone, come on. Come on. - Oh God, they took him. He killed a man. He killed him, and we didn't do anything. - He had a gun. - We could have done something, we didn't know that. - He had a gun! - What the hell's going on, Vince? - We have what we need, let's go. We were never here. - Whoa, are you serious? We can't. We gotta call the police. - And explain what first? The breaking and entering, or the glowing fucking battery? - Unbelievable. Why would they take his body? - We need to go. Now. Scott! - Hey. - You look tired, babe. - Yeah, I didn't sleep too well. - Is everything okay? - Yeah. Yeah, we kinda had a setback. - I'm sure you'll figure it out. Stargate's got nothing on you. - Stargate goes to different worlds, babe. Theoretically, this will take us to different versions of the same world. - Nerd. So I have to do a night video shoot tonight. I'm gonna explain snipe hunting. So don't wait up. - Scott. Have you heard anything? - I haven't heard anything. Have you heard anything? - I haven't heard anything. Why haven't you heard anything? - Gentlemen! Good, you're both here. Dr. Lennon would like to talk with you in the conference room. - Oh, boys! I wanted to apologize for my behavior yesterday in front of Miss Fanning, and the head of this establishment. It was very unprofessional. - Do you accept Dr. Lennon's apology? - Yeah, of course. - No problem. - Great. With that unpleasantness out of the way, then we can all get back to work. Gentlemen. - Keep up the good work, guys. We'll figure this out just yet. - What the hell? Are we slipping into The Twilight Zone or something here? - We saw it happen. Right? We saw it. - Bet your ass we did. - Maybe last night was a trick to mess with us for breaking in. - I don't know. - Let's hope this works. - Going deeper into the weirdness. Why not? - Coordinates? - Locked, 4.994% ordinary matter. - And a whole bunch of zeroes? - And a whole bunch of zeroes. - Energy level? - 77 teraelectronvolts. - Let's make history. Open it more. - You really did it. - We really did it. - How long will it stay open? - With the cryonic battery, who knows? Maybe forever. Okay. Gravity readings, do you have any decay? - Nothing. It's like the door isn't even there. How is it the same? Infinite possibilities, and we dial into a mirror. - I wanna cross over. - I don't think we should. - What? - Not there. - Why not? - It's the same. Doesn't that bother you? - Bother me how? We just smashed particles faster than anyone, ever. We ripped open space and time. - Scott, it's the same! Your room, your garage, your test dummy. Same room and same dummy means same us. A trillion, trillion, trillion times a gazillion possibilities with every microscopic change, and we just happen to dial into the one that could have our damn doppelgangers? - They were your coordinates. - And I was wrong. - No, Vince, this one's perfect. What happens if we choose to open a doorway that's 4.994% with 1,000 zeroes after it, but a one at the very end, instead of another zero? And that leads us to some Earth that's long gone, and we turn Arizona into a literal black hole. - You know as well as I do that we would need an extreme, like 1% or 10% gravity and comparative matter before we find an Earth that's populated by sand people! - That's why this one's perfect. We hit a home run in our first at-bat. Vince, look. Between Lennon dying, and then not dying, and now this, it's been a crazy few days. All right, we'll figure it out. - Don't open it again without me. Right? - Right. - Right? - Got it! Won't open it without you. - This is a nice surprise. I thought you'd be in the garage. - We need to talk. - What happened? Did someone die? So why didn't you call the police? - Yeah, they're usually letting people off with warnings for breaking and entering nowadays. It doesn't matter, 'cause apparently he's alive and fine. - This is so bizarre, Scott. I mean, it's gotta be some kind of a trick. Do you think he's just messing with you guys? - I don't know. Maybe we're not meant to understand it. - But the particle accelerator works? Like, for real? - Yeah. - I'm so proud of you! When do I get to see it? - Soon. Vincent needs to be here. - I knew you could do it. You're gonna find out, like, what makes the universe tick. I bet the Lennon at work today is like a double from the other side. - Don't let that door close behind you. - I wasn't planning on it. Have you discovered the Expulsion Theory yet? - Wow. No, the what? - Yeah. As in two objects of the same matter can't exist on the same side. If that doorway to your matterverse closes behind you, with both of us here, one of us goes, "Poof!" It's a toss of the dice which one of us takes the long trip goodbye. Still not sure where they go, but it looks painful. - Wow. This is overwhelming. - Yeah, I've heard that before. Bet you're wondering about that dummy over there. Never really found much use for it, but we all seem to buy the same dummy. I bought one, because I figured with endless universes and endless variables, a constant would What'd you name it? - What? - The dummy, Jimmy or Johnny? - Oh, Jay. I named it Jay. I guess I thought I would throw it through before I just walked through on my own. - Very curious. The names have always been. - I'm sorry, did you say, "All of us"? - This isn't our first time together, Scott. No, not the first time for you in another version of us. 36 Scotts have all traveled through space and time, and into my workshop. You're 37. So forgive my lack of enthusiasm, but I think even God stopped being surprised after a while. - I never cared much for tea. - I didn't make it for you. What's your matter variable? - Five, a bunch of zeroes, nine, seven as far as I was able to tell. I'm sorry, why do all of us come here to you? - There's an immeasurable number of universes out there, Scottie. A different world for every different person, for every different outcome. So if you take an immeasurable number of people and ask them to all choose a number between one and a million, eventually you'll get enough to choose the same number, right? And so far, 37 Scotts have all lived lives that lead to this machine, to this point in time, to the exact 4.994% ordinary matter. And a bunch of zeroes. - Have you ever crossed over? - No. You can touch me, Scott. Like I said, expulsion only happens when that doorway closes, in which case, you and I would be in for one hell of a pickle. - You had your own machine. - I did. Once. Couldn't create a sustainable power source. Speaking of which, you have any more of those cryonic batteries? - How do you know about that? - It's not my first rodeo. - Well no, I only have the one, and it's being used to power the doorway right now. - Only one. It's a shame. Although, I wonder if you could get another one from Cicero before it's too late. - What do you mean? - Cicero stole my machine, Scott. They manipulated it. Bastardized it. They gained too much power too quickly, and it was too much to control. They're responsible for the worst man-made disaster of all time. Countless people died. Everyone in Cicero is gone, I'm all that's left. Even Vincent's gone. - Vincent? No, that's impossible. How could they steal my technology? - You ever heard of Project Milestone? - Only rumors, whispers. - Scott. Project Milestone is you. - No. That's impossible. - I guarantee it. If your universe is anything like mine, they've been watching you for a long time, studying you. Waiting for you to succeed. They did the same to me. You're more special than you know. - What are you trying to say? - Your machine is the only one that can create a stable path. They wanna use it to connect everything, like some master pathway. But not just two worlds, Scott. All of them. Scott. Project Milestone is you leading Cicero to a singularity in which they control the multiverse. - How do you know all this? - Just watch yourself, Scottie. These people you work for turned a quarter of my United States into no man's land. They tried here once and they failed, and now you're on the clock. Be careful who you trust. - This is a lot to take in. I need to talk to my wife and Vince. - Your wife? - Listen, this has been beyond amazing, thank you. - But you will come back. - I'll be back. - You always do. - This is Vince, leave a message. - Vince. Hey, call me back when you get this, all right? We need to chat. Just call me back. - Hello, Scott. No partner in crime? How is the family? It's Margaret? Margail, isn't it? She's such a sweetheart. - I really should get back to work. - You really should. - Hello! - Hi there. - Just out enjoying my walk. - I can see that. You live nearby? - Why, yes. - Oh, I haven't seen you before. Have you just moved in? - That's a very fancy camera you have there. - Yeah, it's not great, but it works for me. I just make videos and teach people how to do odd jobs around the house. - And what does your husband make? - He works at Cicero Market Technologies. - Oh, that's a very large company, like Haliburton. - Something like that, yeah. - Can he protect you? - Excuse me? - You're a beautiful woman. He should be able to protect you. - It's been great chatting with you, I really gotta get back to work here. Will I be seeing you around? - Oh yes. I'll keep an eye out for you! - Oh, shit. - It doesn't have to be this way. - I don't want to kill you. I wanted you to see how easily someone could have. - Just let me go back. - There is no back. Uh-uh. - What do you mean? - Cicero. They keep trying, and they keep screwing up. You keep screwing up, and now worlds are disappearing. They're gone. You have to stop him, Vincent. - Who? - Scott. You have to stop him before he kills everyone. - What the hell is going on? - Do you think that is what I think it is? - Looks an awful lot like a bug. Well, whatever it is, it's not working anymore. - Someone has planted a bug in our house, Scott. Someone is listening to us. - Did you check the rest of the house? - Of course I did. I looked everywhere. Maybe it's just the one? Do you think Vincent would have like a scanner or something that looks for bugs, like on TV? - He might, but. - But what? - He didn't show up to work today, and I can't get ahold of him. What the hell is going on, Scott? Why would someone wanna spy on us? - I may have an idea. There's someone I want you to meet, but. Honey, you might wanna prepare yourself for a bit of a shock. - Oh, shit! - Is that safe? - Margail, it's really you. After all this time, it's really you. You look just like her. - You look just like him. - Scott. - Yes, Scottie? - How many times have you guys talked? - Only once. Vincent doesn't know yet. - You did this alone? - I was feeling adventurous. - Just the one? - Unfortunately, yes. - Is there one of me on your side? - Sadly, no. My Margail passed away when we were teenagers. I never thought I'd see you again. - What happened to her? - She was sick. That's how I originally chose my career path with Cicero Market Technologies. I thought that if I could find a way to slow down or freeze time, I could come up with the exact timeframe I needed to find a cure. I didn't want anyone to go through what she went through. - I'm so sorry. - You're the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. - Flattered, I mean. That's flattering. - Scott, we need to talk to you about Cicero. - So you two have been together this whole time? - Scott, you said Cicero was following you? - Yes, spies and electronic eavesdropping. - We've found something strange. We think it's some sort of listening device. - Well, if you found one, it's one of many. Has anyone acted strangely around you? - No. - Yes. A man. - What? Who? When? - Today, an old man talked to me out front. He asked me if I felt safe. - That's them, I'm sorry. All I can tell you is, watch yourselves. Don't trust anyone. Not even Vincent. - I trust Vincent with my life. - You may have to. You smell good. - Perhaps that's enough for one night. - Perhaps. - We appreciate it. This has been bizarre, and scary, and incredible. - Margail. If I could close that magical door behind me and stay here with you forever, I would. You're the loveliest creature I've ever seen. Again? - Soon. - I'll hold you to that. - Wow. You did it. So we're just keeping up appearances. You're not gonna confront Cicero about this? - Still no word from Vincent. I'm starting to get real worried, babe. - Scott, I've been thinking about this, and maybe it's time to consider that this whole thing is just beyond our control. - No, no, no, no. No, we can't stop now. Think of all the technological applications. No more landfills, no more running out of resources. - Okay, so you wanna run a oil pipeline through a portal to an alternate reality? - That's not exactly what I meant. - It's not exactly what I meant either. But I mean, people are spying on us. There's another Scott. I mean, he is definitely freaking me out the more I think about it, and he's definitely not you, regardless of the similarity. - Nature versus nurture, I guess. Technically, though, we are the same DNA. - Yeah, well technically, he still freaks me out. All of this does. - I know, babe. I don't know why he thinks Cicero will - Maybe they really do wanna build an oil pipeline through it. - No, they could buy the IP from us and turn it into a gold mine. Now, when this goes public, everyone's gonna wanna see it. - Unless they have a reason to keep it secret. Okay Scott, enough with the unlimited resources bullshit. What's the real reason you're so obsessed with this thing? What's going on? - I never told you how Sean died. - Yeah, you did. I thought it was a car accident. - No, this project. It gives us a chance to go back. - I don't understand. - My grandpa collected World War II era weapons. Pistols, rifles, such. I remember when I was a little boy, my mom spanked my butt so hard one time when I left the cabinet unlocked. Yeah, I was six years old. I knew they were dangerous, but I wanted to have fun. I left it unlocked. Sean was four years old. He wanted to play too. That's how my brother died. The whole idea of this project of smashing God particles and creating doorways into other dimensions. If there's infinite worlds out there, then there's a different world for every different outcome, for every different person. Maybe there's a world where I didn't do that. I want that world, Margail. - I'm so sorry. - Vince? We've been trying to reach. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, no. I'll be right out, two minutes. That was Vince. He sounded really weird. I gotta go. - Go ahead, go talk to him. Get to work. I guess we'll just take this one day at a time. - Hey. - I didn't wanna risk using a cellphone if I didn't have to. - What happened? - You're never gonna believe me. - I was about to say the same thing. - Well, I was shot at and held at gunpoint by a man who used what sure as hell looked like a portable version of our technology to zip out of existence right in front of me. Oh, and this was right after he told me that you're going to murder the world. And my left eyelid has not stopped fucking twitching since. - He said I was gonna kill people? Are you sure? - Yes, I'm fucking sure! He said that you and Cicero did something, and worlds are disappearing. As in more than one. - Could we have caused a decimating ripple in space time? How do we know this guy knows what he's talking about? - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's question the credibility of the man who conjured a portal right in front of me. Oh also, forgot to tel you. I also found in Lennon's rock garden, because that makes sense. There was a stack of Cicero papers with the design for our particle accelerator, and a blueprint for your house. - You serious? - Yes I'm fucking serious. - Damn it. - I thought we'd have enough time, but apparently they already know. - A portable doorway. - Yeah, it was like. Like this light stick he just tossed on the ground, and there was the door, and then there wasn't. I tried to pick it up, but it was cold, and then it was just gone. Scott, when it was open, it was just like ours. I think a little pee came out. - The other Scott said that Cicero was... - Wait, wait, what? What? Wait. Scott! Scott who? - Oh yeah, it gets better/worse. I met a Scott from the other side when I opened the portal. Listen, Margail found a listening device - They really are watching us, aren't they? - We have to go back to work, and keep up appearances. - We need to slow down. - Cicero spent over a billion dollars getting us to freeze sick people. Why would they have any interest in alternate universes? - Maybe they're the ones keeping up appearances. - Maybe freezing people and waking them up in the future is plan B. - Scott, I need you to promise me. Don't open the door again without me, okay? Things are clearly getting out of hand. - No, agreed. Cicero's gonna watch us so closely. We gotta be extra careful opening a beyond space and time in my garage. Words I never thought I'd say out loud. Did someone really shoot at you? - Yep. - Man. - Yep. - You came back. - I wanted to see you. - Oh, I see. - I can feel it. - How soon? - Well, day one of pretending everything's normal, check. - Scott, I've been thinking. That guy at Lennon's rock garden went out of his way to make a point. He could have killed me, but instead he decided to warn me, warn us, about you. - So you don't trust me now? - Maybe he didn't mean you, you. From here on out, I have to be present for everything. Okay? - Yeah, already agreed. - Yeah, yeah, I know, I know, but. I'll come back later tonight, we'll open it one last time, and then, who knows? - You're not saying we sell it? Shut it down? - I don't know, man. - I don't know either, Vince, but I know that this is our baby. All right, well look, I'll catch you tonight, all right? - Okay, see you later. - Be safe. - Well, hello. - Hi. - Hi. So, I have an idea for a video, and I'm gonna go check out the lighting at the dog park. So if it works, I may be home late. - Yeah, just be careful. Things are uncertain right now. - I will. - Have you noticed anything new lately? - Yeah, that's the thing. It's like Vince, Margail and I are being followed. I don't know what to do. - How is Margail? She's quite the one to behold, Scott. You should hang on to her. - Scott, I think things are starting to escalate over here. - The love of your life dying can really shape a person, Scott. - I'm sorry you had to experience that. - I like you, Scottie. This is more contact than I've had with the others. Our relationships have always been somewhat abbreviated. - Scott, I don't know if it was one of those watchers from Cicero, or what, but somebody followed Vince and shot at him, and then disappeared in what he said looked like a portable version of our doorway. - Portable? Curious. - He said something about other worlds are disappearing. - Like mine. All the way? - I guess. - No. No, they wouldn't make that mistake again. - Well, says the person who's met 37 versions of us. - You don't keep very good notes, so they can't track you down. - No, it's too dangerous to leave too much information. Somehow I've always known just to keep the important stuff right here. Should I be worried? About interrogation? Will they show aggression? - No. No, they won't hurt you, not yet. But they will become bolder. Once they're certain of your success, they'll come out from hiding. Any day now. - Why wait? - You can't think of them as a corporation, Scott. That's a false identity. A $32 billion fake ID. No, the money, stocks, employees, it's all a means to an end. What they want is to ascend. - Ascend? What? To God? - They wanna control everything. Think of that kind of power. If any world doesn't comply, they just shut 'em off. Expel them from existence. It's trans-human garbage theory. They wanna become one, physically and spiritually, with the universe, with God. Turn themselves into cosmos. - All of this for religious fanaticism? - Not religion, Scott. Science. Think about it. You can push a button, and end up in any universe. Maybe somewhere down the line is heaven. Or hell. Make no mistake, they'll come out from hiding. They'll make themselves known, and they will manipulate every Scott in every universe 'til they get what they want. Right now that's you. - I think I'm gonna be sick. - Bet you feel like you just got off the Witch's Wheel at the county fair. - You felt it. - That's the doorway. The gravity has its effects, you'll get used to it. - Scott, I hope you understand if after tonight I choose not to pursue this any further. - He can't keep her from me. I hope you understand if I won't pursue it any further. - Hey. Are you sure? - One more time. Collect any final data we can. - And then? Where is he? - He's usually waiting. - That's comforting. - Scott! Let's go. - Whoa, Scott, hang on. Are you sure you wanna sneak in like this? Is it safe? - It's not the first house we've broken into this week. - Yeah, and someone died that time. Sort of. - You're just mad 'cause we didn't find dinosaurs. Where is he? - He's like you, but really disorganized. - Scott? - I'm starting to have a bad feeling about this. - You know scientists achieve greatness at their own personal risk, right? They're willing to sacrifice. - I let you go first, didn't I? - You're in another dimension. Aren't you at least a little excited? - Exciting isn't the word I would choose to describe it. What did he tell you about Margail? His Margail from this side? - She died when they were teenagers. - This is our photo. This was taken two years ago. - What did he say about her? What exactly did he tell you? - What? - What did he say? - He said she got sick and died when they were teenagers, Vince. - Nothing specific? Sick from what? - I didn't ask. - But why would he have this if she died years before it was taken? - Because he lied. - There must 40 or 50 cryonic batteries in here. - My guess would be 36. - Well, Cicero doesn't even have this many. How could he have this? - We need to go. Now. - They're all dead. - Come on! Scott, come on. - What was that? And why would he lie about Margail? - It's not safe to go back there. - They're your coordinates, Vince. - I know! I know. - Why do I feel like there's something more to this? - Hey. You still up, babers? - Yeah. - What are you doing? - I'm just thinking. How was the shoot? - It was great. You okay? - Yeah, yeah. - You coming to bed? - I'll be there in a little bit. - Okay. - Hey, babe! How was it? Excuse me, ma'am, I think you're in the wrong house. - I'm supposed to ask you nicely. - Ask me what? - May I have a cup of sugar? - Maybe you should go to the store. - Will you give us what we ask? - I don't know what you want. - Yes, you do. - What happens when you get what you want? - I'll make you a cake. - Are you gonna kill me? - Come on, Scott! - What are you doing? - Shut up! - Oh my god! Release me! - Wait your turn, sweetheart. - Scott, what are you doing here? - Saving your life. She was gonna kill you. - You don't know that. - Ask her yourself. I told you Cicero was gonna get bolder. The question is, which Cicero does she work for? - Scott, she needs an ambulance, now! - No, what she needs is salvation. Is that what I think it is? - No! No, no, no, no! That's mine! Give it back! - I'll take that as a yes. - What is that thing? - She's not from here. And that was only a matter of time. This device is a cluster of tiny accelerated particles acting as a tether when combined with a foreign object. It makes her invisible. - A tether? - Follow me here, Scott. When a foreign object, such as her. Has this on, they get to coexist without an open doorway, with no risk of expulsion. Thank you. - Wait, wait. Two of her can exist in our universe at the same time? - Bingo, Scottie. My guess is this world was a one-way ticket. Cicero needed him to open the portal again, didn't they? - How long have you been following me? - It doesn't matter now. All that matters is that I have this. And that doorway is the only thing keeping your horrible odds of survival at bay. Who will the universe expel? You? Or the other version of you, out in the world and completely oblivious to the fact that they currently have a 50/50 chance of survival. How fun. Flip the switch, Scott. - No! No, no. - We can't do that. - Flip the switch, Scott, she's getting away. - No. No. This isn't right, Scott! - No! No! Help me, please! - You killed her! - I'm disappointed I you, Scottie. - Why are you here? - Why are any of us here, Scott? - I didn't open that doorway, Scott, how did you cross over on your own? - You better take a kinder tone with me. I didn't have to save you. - That picture of you and Margail, you lied to me. - That doesn't sound like gratitude. - How are you so calm? I'm gonna open this door, and you're gonna go back to your side for good. - Or what? - Or I'll rip that new toy out of your hand and we'll see who the universe likes more. - That hurts, Scott. But I know you. I've known many of you. And if there's two things I've learned it's that one, you wouldn't risk expulsion on a coin toss. That much pain, those kind of odds. And two, the universe always chooses me. Oh, so you cross over all willy-nilly, and now that the shoe's on the other foot you got such a problem, huh? - You're not right, Scott. You killed that woman. You enjoyed it. - She deserved it. - This is the end for us, Scott. You're gonna go back over, and I'm gonna unmake this damn machine. - No, you won't. I know you won't, because I wouldn't. - Go. - Give Margail my love. - You stay the hell away from her. What have we done? - Well, this is some secret agent shit. - I don't think anywhere is safe. - Did something happen? - Yeah. Some woman, I guess she worked for Cicero, came into my house, and then other Scott appeared and killed her. - Wait, what? What? - He was able to open the doorway from his side. I don't know how, but now he's got some device that looks like pedometer that allows him to exist on both sides. - How did he know she was there? The woman? How did he know you were in trouble? - He can see us. Once the doorway was opened, if the two universes share a tangential connection... - Like a connected thread between each universe? - Then he can use the quantum and gravimetric frequencies to generate an image? - Like a trans-dimensional X-ray. - God, he could see us. Margail! - Hey you. I got home like 20 minutes ago, where were you? - Doesn't matter now, you're okay. You were right, babe. With everything you've been through, this is my fault. I could do this forever. - What's gotten into you? - I just love you so much. - I love you too, Scott. - Say it again. - I love you, Scott. - I could look at you forever. - Someone's in a mood. - I am. I've missed you. - Yeah, these last few hours have been pretty rough for me too. Are you not going into work today? - What if I never go back? - Can you grab my phone for me? - Leave it. I don't want any interruptions. - You're acting kinda weird. - Why did we never have kids? - You want kids? Scott, are you okay? - Hindsight's always 20/20 I guess. - It's not too late. We can still talk about having kids if you want. - Run away with me. Right now. - Now? - Just go! Don't tell anyone, pack a few things and leave. What do you say? Be dangerous with me. - That sounds outrageous. - Well, be outrageous with me. - But aren't you ignoring the obvious, Scott? - And what's that? - That I know my husband, and you, asshole, are not him. - I know this is out of the blue. I guess it's a little weird, huh? I just been thinking so much lately about... - No, no, no, sorry. Do not move any closer, I swear to God. Don't! - What are you doing? Babe, it's me. I know this is spontaneous, but we don't have to live every part of our lives according to some detailed plan. We can just get away! - So is that your plan? You wanna just get away, and play house? - Yes. We need this. - Don't come any closer! - You know you're really starting to - Let's see how well you do with a knife in your chest. - Is that your plan? Think this is a movie? If you wanna stab me, you gotta do it right here. Between the ribs. And you better kill me with the first blow, 'cause if you don't, I'm liable to get very angry! - Margail! - Oh, shit. - That's the sternum! Hey, Scott. I was just talking to our wife. Oh. Hi Vincent - Hello Scott. - It's you, isn't it? - I should say the same to you. - Surprise. - What's he talking about, Vince? - It's what I was afraid of. - Afraid of getting caught. Tell me Vince, did you even consider the life of the other Vincent who really lived here? Or was that an equitable risk for you? - Vince? - He's not your Vincent. - How long? - Two years. I'm sorry, Scott. - Vincent! - I did what I had to do to survive. He killed everyone at Cicero. He would have killed me too if I hadn't escaped. - You lied to us for two years? You led us to him! - No, Scott! - We used your coordinates. - Scott, you're my friend, that's why I stayed. I never thought he would find us. And those coordinates, that wasn't his world. It's just where he was hiding. - Wasn't your world, either. - Scott, he killed Margail. - I should have killed you while I had the chance! - You're mad. - No, you let this happen. You could have dismantled that portal at any time, but no! You were curious. Me? I've done this 36 times. 36 bright-eyed, curious Scotts have all come to see me! You know what I did each time? I smiled. I conversed. And then I killed every single one of 'em, and took their stupid batteries. It's an annoyingly limited resource, Vince. And then I would travel from doorway to doorway looking for one where my Margail was still alive. But then all the power died. I wasn't hiding, Vince. I was stuck. So I decided to wait for another powder-white, curious Scott to come see me. But you gave me something so much more valuable. You gave me a world where not only is my love still alive, but she loves me. Oh girl. I think you might have hit something important after all. - How many people have you killed since I ran from you? - Only myself, over and over. - No. Someone warned us. - That's what it meant. You've been changing constants in every universe, and leaving a trail of dead worlds. - No. Don't you get it, Scott? It doesn't matter. None of it matters! You wanna talk about dead worlds? Look at me! My world is dead! Why did I deserve that? Why does your life get to be so perfect? - We need to get him back to his universe now, and shut it down for good. - I think that's probably enough. - Shit, I should've saw that coming. - Let's take a walk, shall we? Roll call, everyone here? Good. You know, Scott. Margail saved your life. That first night you came into my world, I would have killed you. But you said something intriguing, you said, "My wife." That's when I decided to watch. To learn. - You wanted to replace me? It's not too late. - I would rather die. - Everyone's a critic, Vince. - What are you going to do, asshole? - Oh yeah, 'cause I'm the one who lied to my friend for two years, right? - You're a psychopath. - It's neither here nor there. - Story of our lives. - And I suppose I'll go back to my adopted world at the 4.994 and a bunch of zeroes. Yada, yada. Seems to be a constant among many Scott's. So I think I belong there. And I will find you again, Margail. And next time it'll be perfect. On your knees. Now. Get down on your knees! Now! - I won't let you hurt her. - Brave words for a dead man. I should kill you right now! You know, Margail. I don't know why you love him so much. He's a prick. Why don't you love me? - Scott. Just give me the gun. Give me the gun, baby. We can go somewhere together and talk about this. - You'll do that for me? You'll give me another chance? - I was too quick to judge, I see that now. Just let me have the gun before someone else gets hurt. I'll go with you wherever you want. - Did you really think I would fall for that? A for effort, though. - Scott. How do scientists achieve greatness? Sacrifice. - Vince, no! - Who will it be, Scott? Who will the universe expel? Let go, I can't hang on. - This is my world, Scott. - I knew you were special. - I've been waiting for you for a very long time. Your trail of death ends here. Listen to me very carefully. If, when that doorway closes, the universe decides to expel him instead of you, take that thing, destroy it, burn it. I don't care, just get rid of it. - Wait! There's so many of us out there, what can I do? - The right thing. I'm taking care of the ones who don't listen. You're different, Scott. Do as I say and destroy that thing, or I'll come back and kill you myself. I'll always love you, sweetheart. - Okay. - Scott? - Don't be me. Come on, don't be me. - Scott. Are you okay, Scott? - Don't be me. Don't be me! - Scott, are you okay? - Don't be me. Guess who just dismantled the portal. Tell your people to stay the hell away from me. And you. Take whatever universe you came from, and shove it up your ass. - We can't stay here. - Wait, Scott! Wait! If you rebuild it, we can give you anything you want. - Shit. - We don't have time for this. I'm me, you're you. All right, get over it. - What is this place? - It's what every world will look like if we don't stop it. - Stop what? - The end of all creation. You coming? - Next time, girls.
