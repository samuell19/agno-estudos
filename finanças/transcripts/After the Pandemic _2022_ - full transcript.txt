The World Health Organization has confirmed that the new virus strain discovered in the UK has mutated to airborne transmission. The report warns that the infectious... This new strain is far more lethal than the last variant and could potentially kill into the millions by next July. A UK airborne strain has been discovered in Moscow with four infection cases, two of which dead within hours of contracting the mutated variant. Believe that there are currently 2.5 billion confirmed cases of infected individuals, and the death toll has reached 1.6 billion. They'll tell you that efforts to develop vaccines and an effective treatment are not moving fast enough to keep up with the ever mutating virus He added that the last strain is the deadliest and may inevitably kill billions more - over the next few months. - The new strain doesn't appear to be affecting a large portion of global youth. We are working fast to analyze their biological and genetic coding to discover the secret of their resistance to the Virus. These children and teens may represent the last vestige of the human population. All major cities have gone barren with masses of citizens taking refuge in underground bunkers. With a limited food supply their prospects for long-term survival is bleak. 5.3 Billion lives gone by today's count. Millions of children, teens worldwide have abated infection and are now left to their own means of survival. The final chapter of humanity has come to its fated conclusion with a consolation of hope, that the young will inherit the earth. We can't leave for a while. How long? Two, maybe three hours. Hey, today I came this close to losing my world. You took me there. Number one rule, no loud noises. I've seen them pick up sounds from a mile away. That is how they track us. Do you understand? The city's been clean for more than two weeks. You show up and suddenly they're all over the place. They're hunting you. They don't know I'm here. I can't have that. You can stay here the night. Then you have to leave. Tomorrow, scrounge up some food and supplies, help you on your way Hungry? I'll cook us up some food. This is amazing. And it's safe? Yep. Dried pasta the last few years. Same with the beans. Or the radishes in the neighbor's yard. Oh my gosh. So good. What's the last thing you ate? Bad peaches. I threw up. Okay. Before that, canned cat food. You shouldn't do that. Canned pet food goes bad after a few years. - I didn't know that. - Know it. It's the only way you're gonna survive in this world. And stay away from any kind of animal meat, seafood, fresh fish. It's all infected. Your immune system gets slaughtered. You get diseased and then you die. That's why there's so many sick stragglers in this town. Learned that the hard way. What happened? I lost someone very close to me. This one will tell you all the safe plants to eat in the wild and the ones that are poisonous. This one has all the survival tricks you need to know. How to find water, treat wounds, illness, how not to die of hypothermia, stuff like that. You're really making me go away. Yep. Who are the men in the white suits? I call them stalkers. They work for the government or military. In any end of the world scenario, the president and all the elites go underground. Doomsday bunkers, equipped with enough food, power and supplies to last them a few years. What do they want with me? What they don't have. Immunity. We carry their vaccine. With all their money, technology, power, they're stuck in a prison. No trees, no sun, no stars. Makes you think how lucky we are. This planet is ours. We're free. What'll happen if they catch me? Good chance you'll be a lab rat. Or dissected. Forced to be a human incubator. Either way, your life is over. I'm scared. That's what makes you weak. That's why they'll get you. Goodnight. Goodnight. Padded foam, glue, and Velcro to attach them. This is your assignment while I'm gone. And if I by chance stalkers come here for you, this rocket is armed with an explosive. Make sure the two clips are attached to the wires. To launch it, hold this button down, then press this one. The sound will let me know not to return. I better not hear this. Hey, I don't know your name. Doesn't matter. Got you a little canned food. Can opener, matches, compass, first aid. You'll be fine. Let's see. Good job. Got you a gun. Bullets. Might need this if a stalker comes at you. Safety catch is here. Click it down if you need to shoot. Hold it. Hold it. You may have to kill to survive. And one more thing. Don't trust survivors. They may act like your friend until they kill, cook and eat you. I've seen it happen. Ready? Please let me stay with you. It's not personal. I take no responsibility for anyone other than myself And don't waste your tears on me. There's a town about 10 miles south from here. Bear Creek. This road ends a few miles up. And from there you'll be off road and should be safe from the stalkers. It's a clear sky. Moon should give you enough light. Good luck. Goddamn you. Stalkers are due a full sweep of the town, block by block, house by house. Most survivors lack the skills to avoid getting caught. They're careless and stupid. If they haven't been caught by now, they will be soon. Then it's game over. I refuse to let that happen to me. I'd rather die. Since we're at a higher elevation, it'll be two, maybe three days before they reach us. But we'll be gone before that. We'll head north, hide for a while, then come back. Tomorrow, I'll go shopping. Get you geared up, utility jacket, survival supplies, weapons. But remember, you're on probation. I'm giving you one week. If you can prove to me that I'm better with you than I am without, you can stick around. If not, I'm gonna cut you loose. Okay? Okay. But most importantly, pay attention, Ellie. If the enemy is in front of you, don't hesitate even for one second, kill. Don't think of them as people. It's you are them. Now, if you're gonna be sleeping in my bed again, you need to clean up. You stink. When was the last time you bathed? A few days. Thank you, Quinn. For what? Giving me a second chance. You're welcome. You're a good artist. Just thought you should know. Thanks. Good night. Good night. Don't. Sorry. Put her down. Hey. Ellie? Are you okay? Yeah, I have, I have a headache. How long have I been out? A few hours. Last thing I remember is being taken down by stalkers. I, I didn't see you there. I had an idea where you were. What about the stalkers? I killed them. Wow. How did I get here? I dragged you. You saved my life. Thank you. But it was a risk you shouldn't have taken, Ellie. Why'd you do it? Because I care about you. Those feelings you have for others, they make you vulnerable. They'll get you caught. I couldn't let them take you away. You would have done the same for me. No. No, Ellie, I wouldn't have. I know that makes me sound like a bad person, but that's just who I am. I won't put my life at risk for anyone else. Even you. That's selfish. Yeah. It's also survival. Erase all feelings of sympathy or compassion for others if you wanna exist in this world. Cut and dry. I could never be like that. So you're a better person than me. In the end it won't matter. Where are our supplies? Too heavy. Okay. So they know we're on foot. I'm sure they've set up a perimeter of a mile or two. They're looking for us right now. Especially since two of their own were killed. We'll have take our chances here for the night. There's no point in us running around in the dark. Gotta put out this beacon. You smell it too? A lot of death in there. Yeah, this'll do. Hey. Shh! Jackpot. Are you serious? How are you gonna start it? Test a few tricks I know. First we gotta find the keys. Yes! You're getting rid of the gas? Shelf life is only about two years. After that it's piss water. Good. Set them on the counter. What is that? It's Everclear. There's a chance it could work as our fuel. Okay. Moment of truth. You can do a it, dammit! You are such a dork. Okay. This is the one. Hell yeah. - Woo-hoo! - Woo! - Woo! - Woo! Woo! Yeah, woo! - Hell yeah! - Woo-hoo! Woo-hoo-hoo! Woo, yeah! Yeah! I can't remember the last time I was this happy. It's been so long. Woo! Okay. We have enough fuel for about three more miles. We don't wanna run out on the open road. All right, I'm gonna pull off. - Quinn. - I see her. Hey, hey, please! Take me with you, please! Get out of the road or I will run you over. Hey, take me with you, please! I'm giving you three seconds, then your roadkill. No, wait, please! Don't do it. With one gun on you, you might have a shot. But not with three Out of the car! Out of the car, bitches! Damn, that's some good timing. White suits everywhere and now we got us a getaway car. And dinner. I'm gonna cook this one up medium-rare. You're really gonna taste so good. Oh, I'm gonna have some fun with this one before I eat her. Eat this No! Ellie! Come on, get up. You're lucky. The bullet went right through. Hurry, Ellie. Put pressure on the wound. Ellie, stay with me. It's so bad. Damn, out of fuel. Come on. Don't stop. Keep going. Come on, come on, Ellie, up! No, I can't. Ellie! Ellie! Come on, up. No. Go. I surrender! I give up! I surrender. Well, Ellie, we've got plenty of fuel. We're gonna go somewhere far, far away from here. Where they'll never find us. I promise, I'll never let anything happen to you again.
