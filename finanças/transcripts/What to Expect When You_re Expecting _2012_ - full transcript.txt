Make sure your knees stay together. And I'm gonna tell you to hop back into Plank position. Then I'll tell you to hop in. Chin to chest. Roll up nice and slow. It's really important that when you hop... ...into your Plank position, your back stays flat. Okay? When you roll up, chin stays to the chest... ...so that your head is the last thing to come up.

As we see, Tania here- We see her body's nice and flat all the way up. And as you can see, hamstrings straight down. Now, if this is too much, sometimes you might just need to bend your knees. Tania, let's show 'em that they might need to bend their knees... ...if the hamstrings aren't as flexible. Or if that's too much, straighten out. Everybody, start to walk back. Now, if you can't keep your hands flat on the floor... ...straighten out the legs and just come up. Okay? To a half- To a 90-degree. Okay? But if you're flexible, come down. Put your palms down... ...or your fingertips down. Whichever is more comfortable for you. Everybody, hold it there. Hold it there. Now we're just gonna walk our body over to out right leg... ...to do a deep hamstring stretch. Take your hand, put it behind your ankle. And pull your chest toward you. Okay, hold it there. Good job. As you can see, over here... ...Ariel's nice and straight. Body's straight. Very good. Really pull the chest... ...to your quadricep or your knee. Okay, now we're gonna slowly walk it over to the other side. Keepin' your body down. If you're 90 degrees, stay at the 90. But each time, try to breathe through the stretch. So that you can become more flexible. Remember, this is Cardio Recovery. So this is the day... ...where you might wanna drink your Results & Recovery Formula. Do this video. Really stretch it out... ...to not pound your body through those crazy Insanity workouts. How does that feel, Ariel? So nice. Feel good. It's the day off, okay? The day off of crazy Insanity. Walk to the center. And hold that center just like that. Good job, guys. Hold it. Hold it. Chin to chest. And roll up nice and slow. For four. Three. Two. One. And shake it out. Okay. Good. Come a little bit to the front of your mat. Now we're gonna go into some deep muscle work, okay? We're gonna do regular lunges, but we're gonna go really slow. So that we can attack the whole entire muscle. From the quadriceps, to the glutes... ...and even get some of those hamstrings in. Okay? So watch how I go into my squat. Basic, normal squats, we just do this. Okay? We're not doin' that today. We're gonna move nice and slow. So stay with my count. Stay with my speed. And really concentrate on keepin' the core contracted. Back stays flat, okay? Sometimes people arch and round their back. No matter how flexible you are... ...I always want you to keep your back nice and straight. Are we ready? Man in Crew: Yeah! Okay, we're goin' 16 slow squats. Here we go. Three. Two. One. You go.

Key word: Recovery. Contract the core. Now, as you see, Tania's glutes are down. I'm gonna ask her to take 'em a little further down. A little further down. Contract the core. Now what I want you to do, and everybody listen to this: Try to squeeze the inner thighs together. But keep your feet where they are. Squeeze those inner thighs together. Start to feel it in your quadriceps. Do you feel that, Tania? Oh, yeah! Okay, now just hold it there. Hold it there. Hold that position. Breathe. Find your breaths. Breathe nice and good.

Turn it over. Goin' into a lunge position. I want you to watch my lunge position before you go there. Now, the most important thing about the basic lunge is that your hip- Your back leg: Your hip stays over your knee. And your front leg: Your knee stays over your ankle. So as I go into this position- I'm gonna come here. And just watch. I'm gonna bring my hands up so you can see. Okay? You don't wanna do this. You don't wanna do your lunges like this. Okay.

This one... ...you wanna take your feet a little wider than your shoulders. Or however flexible you are is more important. Now, in the pli? stretch, what you gonna do is turn our feet out. Okay? It's important to turn our feet out. But if you're not as flexible in the hips... ...you wanna bring your feet in... ...to wherever your knees can go comfortably. Okay, you wanna keep your knees behind your toes. And you don't want them to dip in like this. You wanna stay over. Okay. So you're here, and you go into your pli?. Just like this. Are we ready?
