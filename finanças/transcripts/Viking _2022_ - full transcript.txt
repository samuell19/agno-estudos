So I confirm: Modification by candidate 242 to the question, You place importance on your dreams. - The answer is now... - True. The answer is True. - End of modification. - Thanks. Why do you want to join the mission? To make a difference. If you're chosen, what could stop you from leaving? Nothing. It's all about teamwork! Turning now to planet Mars, temperatures will vary between -50° and -15° C tomorrow. David? - Better bundle up! Yes, Pierre. But temperatures are above normal for the season. Thanks, Annick. And the countdown to Mars has started. Don't miss our special coverage starting tonight with a look at the five astronauts who'll land on the Red Planet. You can watch it here at 8 pm. We'll be... David? Yes. Christiane Comte from Viking Society. We compiled your results. We think we have a match. Your profiles are identical. Same stress responses, sense of teamwork. Same priorities in organizing tasks. It's impressive. How do you feel? My face feels flushed. Sweaty palms. Accelerated pulse. A buzzing in my ears. Excellent. Same as his reactions. We'd like to meet you. Yeah. I will respect my obligations and the confidentiality of this contract and the mission it refers to. I understand that all contact and/or communication with family or others are strictly forbidden for the mission's duration. In addition, I assume full responsibility for any bodily, moral or material injury, without exception, arising from risks or dangers inherent in the mission. I release and exonerate Viking Society, its parent entity, the Canadian Space Agency and its affiliates as well as all its directors, administrators, associates, agents, service providers, insurers and respective trustees from any responsibility arising from any and all accidents that can entail injury, disability, or even death. He was too stoned to get in! Not stoned! Under his tent! That's what I said! He was using the groundsheet as a blanket. We took a picture to put on a T-shirt. He still has it! That's our Dave! Doing things we only half-understand. Yup. Like saying goodbye, but not where he's going. Give him a break. He said he can't tell us. We're his pals. I know it's hard to understand. It's something I need to do. Can you say for how long? 2½ years. A bit less. I'm glad you're here. I'll miss you. We'll miss you too, buddy! To Dave! To Dave! In the eyes! Thank you! I'll call you! You know I'm happy for you. But you're already gone. And me? What do I do? Do I wait? Well, yeah. I mean... I know it's unfair to ask. It'll go fast, you'll see. We're stronger than that. It's just... something I have to do. I hardly slept, too. It's pretty exciting. Hello. Hi. - Gary. - Hi. Hello. Elizabeth. But seems they call me Liz. A pleasure, Liz. Hi, John. Dr Janet Adams. Captain and Mission Chief. John. A pleasure. From the log I see we don't get along very well. Apparently not. Hello. Hi. Gary. Hi. Steven. Hi, Steven. Hello. Elizabeth. But you can call me Liz. Hi, Liz. Steven. - Dr Janet Adams, Mission Chief. - Steven. Hi. - Hi. John. - Steven. - I saw you earlier. - Yeah. I hope it's nothing serious. If it weren't, we wouldn't be here. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to introduce Roy Walker. Mr Walker works for the American Space Exploration Agency. He'd like to say a few words. Mr Walker... Ronald Reagan said that. If you're here, it's because you've chosen to make great sacrifices. As I did. Lights, please. For over 30 years, the American Space Exploration Agency has prepared the Mars Mission. 30 years of planning to try to anticipate the millions of problems both possible and unimaginable. And believe me... But we must accept that science is an imperfect art. We can't foresee everything. In a few hours, our five astronauts will land on Mars after a seven-month space flight. Unfortunately, news from the crew these last weeks has been worrying. There are already conflicts aboard the shuttle. Nothing major for now, but enough for us to want to intervene. This is a replica of Viking Landers I and II, that we sent to Mars in 1976. By using a duplicate in our laboratory, we were able to solve many technical problems that arose millions of kilometers away. Simulation. Comprehension. Solution. Simulation. Comprehension. Solution. Exactly what we want to do with the human problems on the Mars Mission. You were chosen because your personalities resemble those of our astronauts. The five of you are a near-perfect replica of our crew. With your help, we can comprehend the problems in their daily life and find solutions. We could have continued sending robots to Mars... They rarely let us down. But we can't build humankind's future with machines. We build the future with people like them. Like you. If you're here, you are one of the brave, the courageous, who want to make a real difference. You are our hope. I have faith in you. Darnit! You had it, Jean-Marc. Here we go. We'll let you unpack. If I may, Christiane... I just want to thank you for being here. It's a big day for us, too. Christiane worked hard to make this possible. Now, seeing you here... seeing that our efforts have borne fruit... - it's... - Jean-Marc... We're glad you're here. Thanks, Jean-Marc. Good luck! Can I borrow your pen? I can't find mine. Why not? No problem. Thanks. My pleasure. I'll bring it back. I promise. Here's yesterday's report. Day 215 went quite well, considering what had to be done to set up the station. We've started using the Martian calendar. So today is Sol 1. There's still tension between John and me. It seems we disagree on management styles. That's a priority. Anything to add to today's agenda? John? I have a John vs habitat situation. It seems a noisy piece of equipment keeps John from sleeping. That keeps you from sleeping. How many times has it woken you? Me? I slept fine. That won't do. We need mirror situations. I know, but as it's next to his room... Your room. My room... maybe we can suggest something to help him... - to help me... - I need specifics. We can't assume... - But... - Get me data, OK? Thank you. Liz? I have a Liz vs John situation I'd like to share. Go ahead. It's about the use of resources. Liz noticed... Well, I noticed... John puts two sugars in his coffee. But the ration schedule indicates clearly that it should be one sugar per person. John? Can you confirm? It's true. We use two sugars. Liz, how does that make you feel? I'd say a kind of... jealousy. A feeling of injustice... or inequality? Yes, that's it! Inequality. It creates unnecessary tension in the group, and that's... not good. Any recommendation? My recommendation is we have to be very strict. And even... report cheaters. Interesting. But spying on each other may create other problems. Let's hear from the others. Gary? I also noticed John's two sugars. It didn't bother me, but talking about it now... Yeah, I guess it bothers me. I'm with Liz that if we start letting little things like that go by, next thing you know, John's eating 5 meals a day we'll run out of food, Good. Steven, you haven't spoken. What about you? I agree with John that it's not a good idea to fuel distrust among us. If John needs two sugars in his coffee to be efficient, that takes priority. So... if I need a longer shower to start my day, it's OK? That's different. What if we organize a barter system? For instance, sugar... for a longer shower? We'd have to decide how many minutes per cube? It's too complicated. And we don't have the water. Or enough sugar if you take two. Y'know? It's a question of principle! I think we're good. Nothing's decided. It's common sense. One sugar for everyone. But I propose we establish a barter system. It could help. We'll recommend it. Who'll handle it? Perfect. Liz, I name you head of the committee Equivalences and Exchange for a Fair Distribution of Resources. OK, next point. You seemed unhappy at the meeting. Do you want to talk? I just think we hadn't fully explored the issue. We have a lot of subjects to cover. As Chief, I must ensure we don't fall behind. But I'm noting your comment. How do you feel now? A bit frustrated. Some anger, perhaps? Some, yes. You? A feeling of power and control. But also of having acted correctly. Of having fulfilled my duty. I'm glad we had this conversation. I'm glad we had this conversation. - If I say gray? - Gray. - If I say price? - Price. - See? - See. - Fame? - We're good. Oxygen? Thanks. 10 seconds. OK, all good. What did you do before? You know... I was an aerospace engineer. No, you? High school gym teacher. You? I did event planning. I worked for a company that organizes conferences and stuff. That must be rewarding. I was starting to get bored. So a trip to Mars was a welcome change. Janet to John and Steven. Stay in the mission. You know the protocol. John to Janet. Sorry. Done. No, that wasn't module C. It was B. No, It was C. Hand me the diagram. Here. Janet to Steven. The conflict is you refuse to show the instructions. Steven to Janet. Why wouldn't I show him the manual? He's an aerospace engineer. I'm just a pilot. It's absurd. Janet to Steven. It's about ego. Our job's to improve communication. Steven to Janet. Couldn't we just tell Steven to get a grip? Janet to Steven. You disagree about how to proceed. Focus on the situation. That's C. Hand me that. What for? I can read instructions. I'm the American instructions expert. My male ego's too fragile to hand it to you. We'll install it wrong and that's that. Was that better? Steven to Janet. Was that better? 1 sugar per person. Thanks for understanding. - Good morning. - Good morning. Gary, I'll need your help in the greenhouse later. That won't be possible. The schedule has Gary servicing the space suits. And I have an altercation with John. Then how about Steven? How have the two weeks gone? Fine. You adjust. Your sleep? Not great. Janet put Gary on my case. Excellent. Have you noticed any special activities? Special? You know. It could be harmful if there were special relationships. We can't have it. No, nothing that I've noticed. How often did you masturbate this week? We're on the same team. We have to make sure John and John remain in sync. How often? 3 or 4. 3 or 4? 5. You have to lower it to twice a week, OK? - Twice? - Be grateful. It's total abstinence for Liz. What about... Steven? What, Steven? Is she serious about the mission? - Yes. - Because... in her report Janet wrote that she's not convinced of Steven's "total commitment to the mission." She also mentions "attitude problems" and "errors in applying protocol." What's your opinion? No, I don't agree. Look, I'll be honest. This was organized very fast. They couldn't admit their dream team wasn't perfect. The crew has problems. We did what we could in the time we had. All that to say... our Steven... The Steven... She was our third choice. We had a perfect match, like you. But he opted to stay with his family. Our second choice fell ill. So we were stuck with her. But I have no problem with replacing her if she's not right. No, I think she's serious. It's getting embarrassing. Up till now... They kept none of our recommendations. All of them? Keep that private. I don't want to demoralize the troops. If we don't improve, they'll cut us. What about Liz's Table of Equiv... They rejected it outright. Too complicated. They should've listened to you. Thank you, John. I'm glad we had this conversation. I'm glad we had this conversation. Gary, please ask Steven to pass me the knife. Couldn't you ask him yourself? Steven and I aren't talking. Is that new? Since this morning. OK. That's weird. I've noted it. We'll take it to the station. Not likely they'll find flowers on Mars. Who knows? Well, we know quite a bit. No idea. At least you and I get along. Other suggestions? I have a situation Gary versus... nobody in particular. Nobody in particular? I prefer not to specify, so we stay friendly... But I've noticed a tendency to neglect body hygiene. I know the showers are short but it's important to wash all over. I don't think I have to draw a picture. I'd love to see the picture. Alright, I've noted this. Hygiene. Good point. Thanks, Gary. I'd like to add topic Important Problem. - The situation? - It's just... We've been here a month. I think we spend too much time on trivial problems. Hygiene's not a trivial problem. But it won't make a real difference. How's it useful to their situation? Some things bug me, too. Gary's had my pen for a month. You promised. But it's no big deal. That's why I marked my things. Shall we talk about your pen? That's not the point. The point is that sugar cubes, body hygiene and whose turn it is to do the dishes aren't what matters. Well, for sugar, I think my Table of Equivalences has been useful. Table of Equivalences No, Liz! They didn't use it up there. Or any of our suggestions. Jeez! How do you know? Christiane. She didn't want to discourage us. We obsess about details that change nothing for them. It's true! John and Janet are at odds. Liz and Steven, too. Things will blow up, thanks to us. That's the important problem. Thanks, John. For demoralizing us. Great job. Bravo! What's up? Nothing. Coming? Right. Imagine them. Just canned air. Yeah. But they're living the real thing. Their sacrifice has a purpose. I think Steven is finding it hard. How so? I dunno. His memos seems down. He's hiding something. And you? Do you find it hard? We're so focused on their problems, we forget our own. I wanted to say... I enjoy our discussions. Even if we sometimes disagree, it's productive. - It moves things forward. - Yeah. You? Do you agree? Yeah. We have good talks. - I've nothing against your table. - No. That's alright. I understand I wonder what the point is, too. It helps to talk. - You feel less lonely. - Yeah. You... are you lonely? Sometimes. Great. It's closeness that's lacking. Human warmth. I'm glad we had this conversation. I'm glad we had this conversation. Liz? Yeah? You don't have to strictly obey all Christiane recommendations... About... personal intimacy. You think? I won't tell. Yeah. Sorry. Mind if I sleep here? Well... Just to sleep. Uh, sure. I'm tired of hearing myself snore. Marie-Josée. David. A pleasure, David. - You wanted me? - Yes. Take a seat. What's wrong? Janet wrote in her report that you were... questioning the mission. I don't know about questioning... I ask questions, yes... Is there anything we can do? Is there anything... We've been very impressed by your work so far. You're dedicated, react well to situations... We can't lose you. You're a dreamer... Like us. It's for people like you that we created Viking. To fulfill this dream. What we're doing here is just the first step. We'll push for you to be on the next crew. The next crew? The next crew. There'll be other missions to Mars. We won't send just specialists. We'll need a permanent colony, we'll need... people like you, who are motivated. Your experience here gives you an advantage. So, what should we do? Well... Some of us ask why we can't communicate with the outside. Up there, they get messages from their families. Yes. It's something we can consider. And always only reacting to problems isn't ideal. It limits us. If we could anticipate problematic situations, I think we'd be more useful. You're right. But in my view if we're speaking openly... the main problem is Janet. Did you ask? Not everyone. Steven agrees. Gary, I don't know. And with three we have a majority. Yeah. She may take it badly. We can't let her go on. You're right. Count me in. What do we do now? You could suggest that John have a conversation with Janet. To hear her point of view. Maybe... Janet has things to say, too, but doesn't know how. She's been pretty frank so far. It might be interesting if Liz disagreed with John. We'll try. Can we start over? - From when I come in? - Yeah, to give me a push. I think we have a problem. - What's wrong? - It's Janet. I think she's the problem. Her management style is ruining the mission. She has to go. She's a control freak! Nothing gets done with her. Did you ask the others? Not everyone. Steven agrees with us. Gary, I dunno... But three's a majority. She may take it badly. We can't let her go on. Maybe we... could talk to her? Hear her point of view? Yeah, you're probably right. Good idea. I like that. A softer approach, a dialogue. That'd be my recommendation. I prefer the first one. And you? Me, me? Or me, Liz? Same thing. I dunno... What's best for the mission. Which is best? Gentle or hard? Well... I don't like being caught in the middle. Just your opinion. I... In your heart? No, your head. The heart's unreliable. Think of the mission, your sacrifices... A new chief now will screw up everything. They tossed all our suggestions. We'll improve your Table. They'll have to use it. Our entire future's at stake. Enough! I can't think. I think... John's approach is best. Alright. Fine. Hard it is. You handle Steven. I can't talk to her. Yeah, I'll talk to her. I'm glad we had this conversation. I'm glad we had this conversation. Two minutes. John to Janet. Do you read me, Janet? John to Janet. Do you read me? Good, we can talk. What is it? Today's the day. Liz is with us. - On what? - We're dumping Janet. They can't stand her up there either. We're a majority. OK. Sorry, I think I missed something. When did you grow so enthusiastic about the mission? You don't understand. They'll send you home if you're not serious. They told me. Janet's on your case. John and Steven, I can't hear you. I'd prefer you to stay, but we have to be professional. Janet to John and Steven, come in! Tell me that you're with us. We need the real Steven now. Janet to John and Steven, do you copy? Steven to Janet. Loud and clear. I don't know what happened. - There was interference. - OK. Please proceed. I'm glad we had this con... Let's go! C'mon, let's go! Let's go! Don't stop! Don't stop! We had it! Seriously? We're not fine at all! - We can't do it alone. - We'll manage! Try it again! C'mon, gun it! Great tomatoes, Liz. Good for morale! Janet... - We need to talk. - Go on. After discussion, the crew thinks that you should step down as chief. I wasn't asked. We believe your management endangers the mission. I'd ask for a vote. Who votes for a new chief? Against? I don't want trouble. It's unavoidable, we're five. Steven? How do you vote? For. In that case I move that John be our new chief. For? A majority. As of now, John is our new chief. Well... Thanks, everyone. I accept the mandate with humility. I'd like to recognize the excellent work Janet did. Janet, would you like to share how you're feeling? A mixture of humiliation and anger. If you distance yourself from the situation, how long do you think you'll stay angry? Hard to say. 2, 3 days. Perfect. Let's aim for 2, OK? I'm glad we... Sure. I want to say my door is always open if you ever want to talk. We'll work together, as a team. We've neglected the fun part of the mission. We're here for a while, and I think social activities foster group cohesion. Anyone want to head that? Steven? Sure. I'll head that. Steven, perfect. I name you head of - Recreation. - I'll help if you want. Wonderful. Bon appétit. I endangered the mission? Yeah, I know... That's going a bit far, let's say. I was trying to do my best. Of course. As mission chief you had obligations. Who does he think he is? It's a success. Yup. Everybody came. I'd dance, but... I don't think John's the type. You OK? Why? You seem distant. Distant, no. I'd say more... professional. Don't worry, we'll take care of Steven. Boosting his morale is on my list. We have visitors! Jean-Marc! Christiane! What a surprise! We thought a little party would do us good. Perfect timing! We have great news for you. Your recommendation to change Mission Chief was approved. They loved the idea. Bravo, everyone! We brought some bubbly to celebrate. Yeah, but space bubbly. You fought hard for this. We're proud of you. Thanks. We proved we're useful. And with you as chief I feel... we're on our way. You're lucky. I wanted to be matched, too. With Gary. Or Steven maybe. I think there's Steven in me. Are they screwing up our dream? I'll handle 'em. Of course. How can I help you, Gary? It's about Steven. I think maybe I feel desire for Steven. You mean that was on your memo this morning? It wasn't on the memo. Sit. So... How'd it happen? Working on the Recreation Committee. And how would you describe the relationship? Affinities? Great chemistry. Chemistry? Physical attraction, too. But... Has anything happened? You understand that... it could harm the mission. But you can't control these things. No, for sure. But... is it possible... your emotions are a bit confused? I dunno. I think they are. Y'know, this mission is bigger than us. We have to focus on it. We good? This is yours now. Very kind. I'm glad we had this conversation. I'm glad we had this conversation. Jean-Marc and Christiane are outside for you. Outside? It sounds important. You can take that off. We need to talk. What's going on? We received a message for you. From the outside. Hello, David. Strange talking like this. I hope you're well. I think of you. I... Here life goes on. I work, clean the house, see friends... Boring, earthly stuff. The reason I'm calling is I have bad news. I've had back pain since you left. I thought it was stress or... something like that. I finally had it looked at. They did scans. They found something on my kidneys. A tumor. I need more tests to see how far along it is. They're optimistic, but that's their job. What is this? I'm sorry. We're sorry. How do you feel? My head's spinning. Images. Memories... A sense of helplessness, mostly. Would you like to answer her? Can I? Take as long as you need. Music always feels good. Bon appétit. Hi, Isabelle. I was glad to hear from you. Even if... I wish the news was better. Your voice, your smile... I miss them. When I heard your message, I wanted to be with you. Drop everything. But... I can't. I'm on Mars. It's the choice I made. With all the consequences. The consequence now is not to be there in the worst moment of your life and hold you and support you. I know the sacrifice we're making is worth it. I'm more and more convinced. I hope you forgive me. And that you stay strong. And if you need me with you, just look up to the sky. That bright speck 76,000,000 km from Earth... That's me. Me, who loves you and is sending good thoughts. All my love. Hurry! Hurry! What's wrong? John's hand was crushed. Lay him down. I can't look! Take off his glove. We have to amputate. It may be infected. Hold it down. Don't move, John. Do it. Snip, snip! It's done. - What is it? - You need to rest. Cut it! Cut it off! - What do you mean? - Cut it! Go on, cut it off! Let's go! OK, hold him down. Hold him tight. OK, enough. Simulation. Comprehension. Solution. Not pretty. Don't worry. It won't keep me from being functional when we go to Mars. We'll take you to see a doctor. No need. We keep going. I'm more worried for John. How is he? David, we appreciate your dedication. But we're starting to wonder if you're not taking this too seriously? Too seriously? You didn't have to go that far. On the contrary. With his new responsibilities John's under pressure. And now the accident, too. I have to understand his pain to guide him. I'm here for him. David... we wanted to tell you. Isabelle's fine. She's not sick. She never was. I don't understand. We invented it because John's wife is sick for real. She's not doing well. He doesn't know. They're worried how he'll react. We wanted to see how you'd react. So... Isabelle's alright? Yeah. You said to anticipate problems. We wanted it to seem real. Perhaps we were wrong. You were right. It's hard, but... those are the risks. I think it's important that... John knows. It's important that I know. Is it just me who didn't get a memo? Nobody did. No news from Christiane either. I'll go out, climb on the roof, check the antenna. But did you really have to suit up? They're testing us. Who is? David? Are you OK? Christiane just messaged. No news from up there in 12 hours. No news? That's all I know. Did something happen? It must just be a glitch. Let's not panic. We'll continue. Continue what? What the fuck? Why? We're on break. It's not a break! Let's go! Meeting, now! But... Can we talk over pizza? This is going outside! We have to get serious, fast! It's an emergency! An emergency, really? Think it's funny? Five astronauts' lives are at stake and you laugh. Sorry. Think this is a joke? You yourself called the mission senseless. What's your point? You've never respected our guys up there. No. Quit behaving like you're on holiday, Marie-Josée! Not our real names! Who gives a fuck? David, Marie-Josée... You? Raymond, bus driver. Brigitte, bank teller? Am I the only one who cares? John, calm down. You and your fucking pen! OK, you can let me out. Hello? - Are you calm now? - Yeah! You sure? I said yes. What did you recommend to John? We're getting memos again. John's freaking out. What's going on? Let me out. I don't know if I trust you. I'm not asking, it's an order from your chief. You're not chief anymore. I thought he should know she was sick. It's what I'd have wanted. Not him, it seems. He's out of control. He cut off communications. He said everything from outside was toxic. He slashed his face and screamed for two hours non-stop. He slashed his face? Janet's chief again. Yeah. Things are stable again. OK. Anything else? I'm pregnant. By who? Me. How long? About four months. We think. We think? It's not clear for now. It happened on the trip. What do we do? We've no choice. We copy them. Despite the delay. The first space baby! It'll change the entire group dynamics. We copy them or all this is futile. OK, and who will carry it? Me. I mean... Us. Technically, it has to be you. I think we're all going loco. You, John? What's your take? So you know, I'm against Janet's decision. I'm with you. With me or with Steven? Which one is locked in their room? You want to go all in? We'll go all in. I'll make you a little Martian! Liz? We do it. Now. Before I reconsider. One minute. How's Steven? Not good, John. I mean, how are you? I want to know how you are. 30 seconds. Marie-Josée! I'm sorry. I'm sorry we grew apart. Yeah, me too. But it wasn't just me. I know. I was intense. You don't understand. It wasn't just me. John to Steven, come in. John to Steven, come in. Marie-Josée, come in. Please. We lost Steven. Lost? There was an accident. We thought it was an accident. He took... He wasn't well. It should've been avoidable. Or else, what's the point? You'll have to manage without him. I think that it's important we stay strong. It's now they need us up there. Ronald Reagan said that when the Challenger exploded. John to Liz. I think we should go back. Liz to John... I found it! Liz! I have it! John to Liz. John to Liz, come in. John to station. Christiane to John. Christiane to John. Where are you? We're looking for you. John? Liz is here. She's fine. The baby's fine. Do you copy? John? We need you, John. Come in, John. This is Isabelle. Leave a message. Hi, Isa. It's me. I'm back. I'm back. I don't know where exactly I am, but I'm here. I'm all here. And... I know that I'm really sorry for... I was stupid. And I... Jeez! Look... My thing is over. If ever you... If it's not too late... can I say, I love you? I'll call you back. We'll talk. We need to talk. Thank you. Subtitles: Robert Gray, Kinograph
