It's our own backyard. It's illegal! You need a business license and inspection. I-It's illegal! My friend. There's not enough parking lots. And no street parking allowed. This makes us look bad.

Do you need more prizes? More prizes for the clown thing! Hello, ladies. How are you? Don't spend all your-- Oh, careful, careful, careful. Wait for it, wait for it, wait for it. There you go! -Oh, thank you. I have no idea what this is. All right. Give it a shot. Why are they dancing? Where's the music? It's in the headphones. It's what they call a "silent disco." The son of the people in the yellow house set it up. It's... I'm gonna try it. It's free. Come on. Come on over here! Check this out! Just put it on. You have to press the button. Oh.

Thank you for listening to me the other day. It's hard to be strong all the time. It is. Ba-ooh! [Maria and Gabriel laugh] Do that again! Do what again? [♪ "Revolution" resumes ♪] [♪♪♪] [silence except for footfalls] Whoo-hoo! Yeah, that's the way! Whoo! [gulls call, freighter horns sound] [sniffs] Bing? Bing? Bing? What are you doing? [in Cantonese] You quit smoking years ago. [in English] Everything will be okay. [in Cantonese] You will be okay. [in Cantonese] May says... ...we're waiting to become butterflies. This is... ...the larvae part. [in English] What if nothing happens... no butterfly... no nothing. Huh? Then what? I don't like this. Do you? Do you? There's only one direction we can go. [voice trembling]: And, in the end... it's not good news. [sobbing]: All we do... is rot in the ground. I don't like it. [weeping] I don't like it. [sobbing louder] [♪♪♪] [in Mandarin] Why are you back? I broke it off already. You and I have no more business. [in English] I... What? Speak. I forgive you. [sniffs shakily] Thank you. Now... can you take him back? [confused chuckle] Please? Why would you ask me this? Things were much better for me when he with you. [sighs] I came as a student... Hoping to find my place. I thought I'd be married by now, with family... children. It's lonely. I was scared. I'm still scared. [voice cracks]: I feel shame. I am so, so sorry for everything. I cannot go back. Dad, I need to talk to you about an invitation. Dad? It's really important. [dazed]: Hmm? You wanted to... talk to me about something? What is so important? Uh... when was the last time you went to a wedding, Dad? What? Um... Well... now that I have two children, like you do... and I-I-- I worry all the time about them, I was wondering if, um... ...you did that. Worry... when we were younger. Of course I did. When we first got here, I worked at the only job I could get. Yes, slaughtering chickens. I... I know. You know? You know? I killed for eight hours a day. The smell... the blood... just so I could put a roof over your head. You think I liked doing that? I was a math teacher in Hong Kong. I know, Dad. All I could think of were you children. And you ask me if I worried about you? Every choice I made, I made for this family. Why are you getting so upset? I don't want to talk anymore. [sighing heavily] Dad, I am sorry if I upset you, but this is-- this is really important. [quietly]: My father was such a strong man. Never afraid. Never weak. He went from rich to poor during the Communist Revolution. Yes, you mentioned that before. I have not been good enough. Ever. W-What? I've let him down. And I've let you down. I've let everyone down. It's too late. What? What's too late? [quietly]: It's too late. Baba. What? What's too late? [birds singing] We never see you anymore! I've been busy at home. Ah. What? What's wrong? It's Amy. She died last night. And... I don't-- I just... saw you, so I thought you should know, 'cause she liked you. S-S-She liked all of you. I'm sorry. "She died last night." It's such a weird thing for me to hear myself say. Oh. [Gabriel weeping] [slams door] His wife just died. I told you. Still, you do not touch him. How does that make me look? What will people think? He's not even one of us! You always say... [in Cantonese] When in Rome. [Bing huffs] Don't give me your lip. If you were me. [in English] ...You might do the same thing. I wouldn't touch him! [in Cantonese] You would not help a friend? He is not my friend. He is my friend! [yells]: Well, not anymore! And no more selling parking! [rain falls on the window] [turns on bath water] [sobbing] [♪♪♪] [dishes clinking] [in Cantonese] Do you know what Dad is feeding you? Does he understand? [in English] No. No, he does not know what you're saying. [in Cantonese] I do. Awesome! Awesome, bud! I was able to get the travel agent to give me a credit for Tokyo. Maybe we should go there, eh, Maria? That's a great idea! You guys should go. Tokyo is in Japan. Its flag is red and white. That's right! Good. [Jonathan]: So when do you guys think you're gonna go? Whenever Maria wants to. Oh, you know, go for the cherry blossoms. Mom, what are you doing? Sit down. We're talking about your trip. I already have a trip. [Bing]: Where are you going? I'm going to Charlie's wedding. Ma? What? [Maria exhales] [in Cantonese] Our son is getting married. [in English] I want to be there! [sets bowl down] [in Cantonese] I forbid it. Who are you to forbid me? Who are you? You come back here. [in English] Dad. Dad. You can't forbid her. She's a free woman. We're all going to Charlie's wedding. [gasps indignantly] He wants you to come. You are the one who put poison in this house. Okay, Maxxy, I think we're gonna go. What about dinner? Just get your stuff. Do as you're told, okay? [chairs creaking] We'll be out back. Let's go. Is that what you want to teach your grandson? To be a bully, Dad? Shame on you! You wait! What? What? You want to disown me too? Fine! Go ahead! You know what? I don't care anymore. You cannot treat people like that! And especially not the woman who's given her whole life to you! Ava! Yes? [footsteps receding] Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. What? I got you. No. I know. I'm fine. I know. I got you anyway. Okay? Thank you. I love you. I love you too. [♪♪♪] [door opening] You're not going anywhere. Let me go! No. [in Cantonese] Do you want to fight? Come back here. What's the matter? You know in your heart what's the matter. Maria! We've been together so long. Don't - everyone can see. Maria. Maria! Remember your birthday. [in English] Blow out the candle. Make a wish. [in Cantonese] Remember that? I remember. [in Cantonese] At that moment, what were you thinking about? Were you thinking of me? You weren't thinking about me. Why should I think about you? Hey. Maria. [in Cantonese] I'm so sorry. Sorry? Because I caught you. You're just sorry you got caught. I am truly sorry. I know I'm no good. I know I'm stupid. I know I'm weak. But this whole time I was thinking of you. Do you know why I wanted you to learn English? So that if anything ever happened to me, you would be fine. Maria... I need you. You don't get to need me. Understand? From now on, the world is not about you anymore. [♪♪♪] Up... down. Up... down. Anita? Can you do my parking while I'm gone? I'll give you 50%. Would have done it for 30. [all laughing] Thank you. Are you going somewhere? My son's getting married. You have a son? I didn't know. Oh, yes. How are you? Uh... [sighs] I'm... I'm... We'll talk when I come back? Okay. Goodbye, Maria. [overlapping English and Cantonese] Okay. [Anita speaking Cantonese] [Gabriel]: What? [♪♪♪] [announcer]: Now boarding, ferry to Bowen Island. [laughing] Ohh! [both laughing] [♪♪♪] [all talking Cantonese, overlapping] [♪♪♪] [gulls crying] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪]
