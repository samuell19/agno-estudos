Also, he didn't even know this the tomb of his ancestors This is absurd The reason why His Majesty is here This is because his throne is deprived by the others He didn't know this place is because his ancestors were afraid of grave plunders So they built 72 faked tombs in total Really? Oh, no! I often came here for fun Your Majesty You may stand up Thanks, Ten! Oh, no! I mean Your Majesty I'm sorry!
