May the fire burn in the name of Jesus! May it burn the evil spirits! Let go of me! I don't want to! In the name of God, come out of this body! Devil, come out! Tell them what will happen to you if you continue doing witchcraft! If I do witchcraft again, my punishment will be death. Say it again! - The punishment will be death. Do you want him to be cured? - Yes, cure him! Let us chase away the evil spirits! Let us bury them! José! When he ran away, the preacher confirmed he was a witch. He came to hide in the house! Child witches are the root of all Kinshasa's problems! Since my marriage, I can't sleep at night! So much suffering! I live with your child witch under my roof. Every night he devours me! He's bewitching me! What do you have to say? - I won't throw him out! He's your son, not mine! - We'll take him back to church. You have no work! How will we pay? It's your fault! Spawn of your mother! Hey, you! Hey! Help me! What's going on? You're breaking the law. Don't you know the highway code, article 54? Look behind you, the white man's filming us. What are you filming? I'm making a film about Kinshasa. - Stop filming! Do you have a permit? - Yes. This permit doesn't allow you to film the police. I've brought you these men. I saw them filming in the street. They have a permit, but they filmed me. They filmed you? I know this, it's for the Chief. Wait here. This is between us. We'll work something out, I know people. Prepare a little envelope and... Where are you taking me, brother? - To my base. I'm from a village. The city isn't easy for me. We've arrived at base. Will your friends be there? - Yes. I'll stay with you, you're my only friend. This is our base, Chaleur's Bar. Let's party! We are lost to your hearts! We're the forgotten ones, without news. Who's he? - He's my pal. We don't know him. Where's he from? - He's with me. He can't even sing! We don't want him. He's not from here! Beat it! We'll smash his face in! Tell him to beat it! OK, he's leaving. I'll be back! Not cool your friends. What they did wasn't nice. You've become shégué, you have to fight now. I earn my money by selling weed and whisky. I use it to buy sandals, clothes and I eat. Brother, never sleep alone. Sleep in a group. People come at night and crush you with a big stone. To make sure no one steals your sandals, wear them like this. Wedge them tightly, then sleep like this. And you always sleep here? Brother, sleep does not choose its spot. You can sleep anywhere. Look what I've brought for you. - Where did you steal that? I'm a warrior, I stole it from a mama. The one who casts bad spells on us? - No, not that one! Let's eat, friends! Let's party! Don't try to take, give what you have in your heart Don't hope for luck, it's your willpower that counts Let him talk first Then speak from your heart Let him talk first You see, he can sing. He can join our group. Brother, It's OK. Give me some skin and let's go. Witch! Come and greet him. Gaby, bring me that water! Gently. Thank you. Easy guys, easy! Wait for me, I'll bring the money later. The child is sick and you ask me to wait. A father should rush to take his child to hospital. You should be ashamed! Did you hear somewhere that policemen had received their pay? You should have thought of that before having kids! The child is sick and we should just sit and wait? I said wait and I'll find the money. You take him to the hospital. We can't even afford medicine to bring down his fever! How long will this last? Kelly, calm down! - How long? They film us, and you're glad! We had a deal! - A deal? Oh, yeah? You believed that lie? Is that what he told you? We agree to be filmed on one condition: film the house, too! Look at the house where papa commander lives. It's a shack! I'm not a papa commander. Look, isn't this hell? When the sun's at its highest, it'll be hell! What sort of life d'you want for the kids? The same that me, their mother, suffered in the streets? You want my kids to suffer in the streets, too? Is this what you promised me? An iron shack? The shégués you see in the streets aren't witches, you know. They're not. It's because of the irresponsibility of their parents. Like you. now, irresponsible! I prostituted myself to survive. I learned French in the streets. Is that what you want for my kids? Without money, we can't send the kids to school. Without money, we can't take the kids to hospital. When will all this stop? When? You're already drunk! - This is our place! You're already drunk! - This is our place! Give me the money. Give it to Rachel! She'll get her kicks. Hey, you! You stole her money! It's not true! It wasn't me. Leave him alone! Did you steal? - No! What's going on? - He stole from the lady's bag! Take it easy! He stole? - From my bag! Did you steal? - I didn't do anything! To the cells! You, beat it! We'll take care of you, shégué! I was collecting rubbish, some adults blocked my way. They said "Give us your money, kid." I told them I had nothing. I asked them to be patient and that the next time I'd give them 2000 each. They refused, they frisked me. They found the dough you gave me. They grabbed it and beat me up. They smashed my face in, then ran away. Think I'm gonna believe that, witch? - I'm going to search him! Give back the money! - I haven't got it. Don't talk bullshit! - We'll search your asshole! Grand Chaleur, your children are hungry! This witch says someone stole our money. You don't work but you ask me for money? Without work you're nothing! - He says they stole our money! The streets are tough! You know how it is. Someone stole it, so what! You're hurt again, why can't you just stay calm? Look what you've done! Did you hit him so he'd hurt all day? Do you think you did the right thing? - No, Vieux Chaleur. But if he swindles his friends, we punish him. What you did, is it normal? He couldn't defend himself. Is that a reason to hit him? You have to respect the music when you dance. More conviction! Apply your mind to everything you do. It's the joy we love every day! Move back a bit! Papa, maman, when you make a child show love when you raise him. You must put him on the right path! And you, child, have respect for your parents! Finish your studies and then... help your parents! And you, papas, don't get tired of your kids! Because you conceived them! Don't abandon them! One day, they will help you! Raise a child with respect, and he will follow the path of respect. And if everyone respects him, It'll be his free pass. Children love their parents! Children love their parents! What would you like? Put the fish on the tray. Watch out for the sauce. Finished! Mama Joséphine, I've finished. Is it done? - Yes. Put that there. Did you clean everything? OK, thanks. I don't have any money. I'll give you some fufu. OK, boy? Give him 300 worth of fish. Give the head. Mama Joséphine, I'm hungry. Give some for me, too. I'll give some more fufu, for you to eat together. Share! Move back. Old guy, these antennas are great! That's 3000. One day, I'll buy one like that for my mother. Champion Chaleur's antenna is bigger. This one goes up high? - You put it high. Reverse. Turn the wheel. - Here we go! I told you not to brake. Take it slow. Carry on. Other way. Move out of the way! Straighten the wheel. That's good. Get down. - No, old Django, More! Get out calmly. That's enough. Well done, kid. You did a good job. You're a fake old man. - Off you go. kids. You old fool. - You're my kids. Leave calmly. Leave calmly. One sachet will give you a boner for two weeks! Without ejaculating! You stay stiff, you're powerful. When you think about your woman, you get a hard-on. If you don't think about her, you're normal. As soon as you see a woman's body, the power returns and you get stiff. When I use the herbs with my husband, I get double the pleasure. Maman is delirious with pleasure! She's getting jealous. She suspects me of looking elsewhere. It gives so much pleasure! You take some spit, you mix it with the powder. Rub the... ...the cock! Massage it in! Wait. Four hours! The pleasure starts when you feel a tingling. Even generals and colonels use this. Even in the mosque, the imam. Give me the stuff! Come here! - How much? 1000 francs. And you give me 500? You say 1000? - 1000 francs! You show your guy, it works a treat! Really? - Yes, explain it to him good. You know what you chicks are like! Blabbing about nothing. See this? It's the real stuff! Open it like this. Add some spit. Grab his cock, right where it was cut. You're embarrassing me. - Don't be ashamed! Find a moment to show him. - Forget it! Tell him to stay calm, and stroke him. You do it. Me? - Stroke him good. It lasts 3 days? - 5 days! Calm and sure! - It's the normal treatment? The cock stays hard! Forget it. - Vibrations, non-stop ! Stop that, old Django. People will jump overboard for it. This stuff is terrifying! Django! Throw us the stuff! - No! Hide that, old Django! Django! Throw us some! It's risky... No, hide that! No. Beat it, you're filthy! Why are they filming us? Be careful, she's a lady! Careful papa, you'll knock me down! Gauthier, did you find the driver? - Yes. Take my bag. Let's get out of here. Quick! Did you negotiate the price with the driver? - Yes! Django. got any? Got any stuff, Django? Give me some for 500! Grab him! Help the old guy! Stand up! Hold him, we're leaving! Bastards! Don't touch my things again! You piss me off! You piss me off! Hello, how are you? - Fine. Give me my bag, I'll pay you. Leave that, we'll do it somewhere safe. No one touched it? - No one. Nobody stole anything? - Check for yourself. Pay us the 1000 Francs. - I only have 500. Old Django. that's not fair! - If I have money, I give it to you. You're my little one, stay calm. Calm? Get lost, crook! I've never seen a rotten shégué like you! Give me my dough! Fake old guy! Dirty beast! Gambela market! Gambela! 250 francs! Gambela market! Our old pal with the cap! Our friend! How are you. old guy? - You're chic. You're geniuses, my kids. I invented my song at the big market. The big market? What gave you the inspiration? I was with friends and we were throwing out words. Then one day I thought: "What if I did a rap? If I bring it all together, it might just work." When you get together. for the music, you form a whole. The beat is the beat of friends. You meet up. It all comes together. It makes a sound. The sound becomes one. One does that, another does something else... it becomes a single thing, a single movement. Hey guy, the world belongs to God! When fighting breaks out, don't be a fool, beat it! You'll be put in cuffs! Taken to jail! Your family you will leave, hard labour you will do. A pail of filth you'll eat, rotting beans you will swallow. And they'll beat your ass with a whip! We must stay in time. - You always rush it! You, listen! He goes chakachak and you come in with boom boom. When you're in the street, sometimes you eat, you drink tea in the morning, you eat at the resto. You go to the market, you take a mango for free, some oranges, for free. Those who stay at home may not see an orange for a month. But you, in the streets, you get lots of stuff! You shégués are winners. You're rich! He who struggles alone is saved. He knows freedom. Will you be able to live truly, protecting the music? A musician who chooses music gives up all other worldly work. He leaves it all in a mess and devotes everything to the sound. He has respect and pride, he's like a flower. Come down and stop that racket! Come down and stop that racket! Ah, no. Mister, come on down! How are you, pal? Come down! I order you to come down! - Chief, I'm rehearsing! Come down, it's dangerous! Chief, I can't hear the birds, too many trucks! Here, the birds are closer to me! Quit talking nonsense! I'll fetch a ladder and come to get you! Hey, you! Hey! Don't run away! Pack this up! Papa, take it easy! Let them sell. The celebrations start soon. Think of the families! Go sell elsewhere, this wall is dangerous! It won't fall down. The wall's been here for years. Calm your heart. - What's in it for us? Alright, you speak well. But what if the wall falls on these people? I understand, papa, but this is December. Parents do what they can to survive with their family. Let's go to my resto to talk it over. OK, then. Chiefs, take a seat. We'll bring you something to calm your heart, my papas. On our way here, you said you had a problem? I have a problem with the owner. He started works 6 months ago. I gave him money and all the rest. My resto, my family, everything is here. Suddenly, he wants to pay back my deposit to force me to leave. My family is here, my in-laws. The customers know me, they come here. I don't want to leave, I want to continue my resto here. Did he give you notice? - No. He's found someone who'll pay more. That way. he can finish the works. - That's not possible. It's not possible! It hurts me. I don't know what to do. You have to take care of this, my papas. He's a thief. - We'll take care of him. We'll get him! You've done a good job. It was all damaged. - I've varnished it. Listen to the sound, try it! Hey, old guy! - Little Bebson, how are you? Sit down, little guy. It's been a while. - That's mystical, old guy! A little walk does me good. That thing makes dangerous sounds. Too much! True genre! You like it? - Danger! That's classical music, every note tip-top in place. That's a great groove. - Josephine! The owner's throwing your stuff out! - Really? Bebson, help me, take my instrument. Bebson, help me, take my instrument. Let's go! Bebson, hurry up! Django! Get on! We're off! Mama Joséphine. Tomorrow, you have to be out of my house! Don't leave me like this! - Don't touch him! Don't do this! We must talk, papa! Hands off! Don't go, let's talk! I beg you, let's talk things over! No, is no! - We must negotiate. Let's talk! Switch off the engine! Your tires are worn. And your rear-view mirror is broken. It was an accident. - Get out! Get out of there! Beat it, you animal! What's going on? Put the window up! You OK? - I'm fine, papa. You want to throw Joséphine out on the street? Someone offered me more money for the plot. I'm taking you down to the station. You've too many violations! Rear-view, 50 dollars. Worn tires, 50 dollars. Bumper, 50 dollars. Sidelights, 50 dollars. Spare tire... - 100 dollars! Spare tire... - 100 dollars! You have to fend for yourself. Article 15, mama! To survive, fend for yourself! Hi! It's nice here. How are you? - Good Rolling on, rolling on! Working hard? I've been looking for you. Where are your pals? At the market, looking for work. Inside? You don't feel like rehearsing these days? We can't. We're starving, we have no money. We'll rehearse tonight, then. It'll be great! Rehearse, rehearse. That's the solution. Make a good band, record a good piece! You're always preaching to us, but you still haven't made your CD. You never even finished it. See you tonight, OK? Work well, Joël. Shit! That piece was almost mixed. - It doesn't matter. I know a good studio, discreet. We'll be able to work at our ease. No complications, It'll be fine. I know the guard. Two! Stop this racket! Sit down there. Papa! Bebson! What's going on? We're finishing up! - No, this wasn't the deal! It's almost done... No, stop! There are other sessions. Papa Wemba is coming to record! You're not the only one here, you know. Silence, you lot. People are working here! - Alright. Put out the fire, papa! He's right, brothers. We'll finish and leave, no problem. We change nothing. Shhh! Keep it down! Imagine if we came here for real, recorded a CD! Shhh, be quiet! It's beautiful! It's a beautiful place. - Let's steal the speakers! Papas, mamas, brothers and sisters, hello! - Hello! Thank you for listening to us tonight. Let me announce the presence of our international star: Bebson! Bebson De La Rue! The kid from Paris! But first, a song! What's going on? What are you doing here? Get out! What a mess in here! Hurry Papa Wemba's here! Bebson! What's that? It's a truck... mystical! Call that a truck? It'll never make it! It's an adventure! That truck's been overhauled. Quick! Quick! You're a musician and you dress like that? - We've got classy clothes for after! Get changed! - Chill! This truck has a leak! - It's just the cooler. I call that a leak! What time will we get there? It's mystical. Look at that tire! - It's funny. That's a mystical tire. This truck won't make it! Has it got an engine? - It's mystical, intriguing stuff. It's got nuts and bolts, gears! Wait, Bebson! You have to understand. It's mega important. Papa Wemba will be at this concert. It's funny, Papa will be there. That's hot! It's nothing serious. That's funny! How long will it take? 4 or 5 hours. My true old Papa Wemba! Bebson still isn't here. We'll just wait and hope. I told you. Bebson isn't reliable, he messes things up. We should do the concert instead of him. We're not good enough, brothers. You screwed up the gig! What are you going to do now? And us, how will we manage? Good luck with your CD. The costs are high. I want no more people at my place. D'you hear? Don't you have ears? I'm tired of all this talking. Not like that and not in my house! I have 8 kids of my own. Yours makes 9. At your age, I have to feed you and your son? And you wear my clothes! With your filthy child, a witch! I don't want him here! Look for somewhere to dump him or go away with him. What do you want? For him to curse you. too? Mama, I'll earn some money and I'll help you. Gauthier, where have you been? We were eating. - Eating? You know I have a rehearsal. Why were you so slow? I want us to do the same thing. If we do a concert, we'll earn heaps of money! That cash will help us. We have to earn tons! That cash will help us. We have to earn tons! Don't all answer at once! Those who want to do it, raise their hand. You, why? I want to make money and study, that's all. Our mama Rachel! - I want money to study and become intelligent, to help families in poverty, to own things for myself, souvenirs. That's why I want this concert, to quit living in the streets and become a man in people's eyes. I'm just happy to have money, I put it in my pocket. What I want is to be like Michael Jackson. I want to win my life, buy cars and airplanes, live in my house and become even more successful. We have to find a name. Kids, I suggest "The Devil Does Not Exist". You see that fire, yet the devil isn't there! "The Devil Does Not Exist", good idea! The Devil doesn't exist! Brothers! Come to listen to how grown-ups do things? Big Bebson, we need you. - What have you got to say? We're going to do an amazing concert! It's been a while. It'll be out of this world. This time, you have to be there. What will we play? - The songs we rehearsed. We'll play Boom Boom Chaka! Boom Boom Chaka? Yes, that's a good one. We really need you. I have an a capella rehearsal. We'll talk after. OK, but hurry up. The children want us to play with them. We could accompany them, then follow on with our pieces. It's good for them and us. - These kids have inspiration. The old guys like you. Playing with kids is trendy. They sing well, they have good ideas. How shall we do this? It depends on you. As long as we play. What we want is cash in our pockets. Don't mess up like you did with Papa Wemba. We waited for you and you didn't turn up! You're tough on me, kid. You're the new generation. Generator! OK, let's go! Kids, the show has to be hot! Kids, the show has to be hot! Rehearse, rehearsal, we'll find the solution. Let's go. all together. I'll be the metronome. Here's the rhythm of feelings to dance better What's this racket? I give you a job and you dance? Come here, you! Get down! Come here! You've broken the stuff! Where is Evala? You were supposed to watch them, idiot. Which way did they go? - Get those hammers back You're fired! Catch them! Hey! I got fired because of you! Filthy shégué! Whore! Bastards!! Forget it, asshole! - I'll beat the shit out of you! Little bitch! It's you I'm looking for! You can't touch us! Wait and see! - Forget it! Beat it, peasant! I'll get you! Let go of me. Drop dead, filthy beast! I'll rip your cunt wide open! I'll rip your cunt wide open! What I want is to form a music band so I can escape to Europe. I want to be a policeman so I can steal in peace. You have to be a politician to steal with ease. Politician? You, come here! Let go of me! I told you I'd find you! I'll rip you apart! We'll have some fun, you and me. Little whore! Everything should be up there by now! Hurry up! You can't let the kids carry this stuff. They'll fuck it up! The kids are working. So what? This costs the fucking earth! It's not for kids! They rented it with their money. Bebson should have been here ages ago! He won't come! Stay calm! Stop panicking. I've prepared some chikwangue. Let's set up the sound system while we wait for Bebson. Take it easy, he'll be here. Take heart, no point in panicking. - He'll do what he did with Papa Wemba. I've brought you some food. Calm down. Bebson's an adventurer, he's useless! We're waiting for him to play with us and he hasn't come! He's a crazy street man! He has to be here so we can make some dough! We can't wait any longer, we have to do it. Take heart, guys! Papas, mamas, brothers and sisters, hello. - Hello! We're going to play the great concert of the shégués. Our group is called The Devil Does Not Exist.
