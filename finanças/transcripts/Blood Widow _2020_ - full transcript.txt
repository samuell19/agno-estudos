VALENTINE I have no information about the killing in the garage at all. What I've told you before is what I've told you. No information regarding the car? Like I said, when we have concrete information, we'll let you know. Have you identified the girl? No comment. Is it the same killer? No comment. Can you comment on anything? It must be nice to hold a microphone and badger people for a living. Can I quote you on that? STOKES What Detective Valentine is trying to say is that we appreciate you have a job to do. You need to get answers and information to the public and part of our job is to convey that information about the progress of the case that is impacting our community. It's a delicate balance. We have our best people working on this around the clock, and we have made significant progress on this case. But until we have hard evidence it would be unethical and irresponsible to comment further. Thank you for your patience. Let's go.

Your victim's blood type is B positive, your second sample is VALENTINE (INTERRUPTS) The second sample is the killer's, doc. Okay, Valentine. Your killer's red blood cells lack heme. Heme is the building block in the RBC that allows it to bond to iron. Your killer has a very rare sophisticated form of iron deficiency anemia. Normally this stuff is really textbook to identify under the scope, but your killer's anemia has several variations that are difficult to pinpoint. VALENTINE So what does that do for me? Well, it's a bit out of my expertise. I placed a call to an old colleague of mine, a reputable hematologist. He recommended a world-renowned specialist out of Mexico. He might be able to explain the almost pica-like cravings for iron and the link between that and your killer's feeding habits. VALENTINE Anything else? Actually yes, there was a case in the 1970's.

Call it unique anemia if you must, but believe me detective it's far more sinister than that. What do you mean sinister? Let me tell you, Detective, back in the 1970's I was a consultant on a series of murders in the Yucatán. The killer, or killers all had the same hemoglobinuria. Okay, you're going to have to lead me by the hand, but slowly. Paroxysmal usually means manifesting in spasmatic, unpredictable or variable patterns. So this anemia isn't manifesting on a consistent basis? Correct. Hemoglobinuria is the abnormal expulsion of hemoglobin in the urine. Thus, there is a variable, usually unpredictable hemoglobin, the molecule that allows iron to bind with oxygen in the red blood cells. The body is eliminating it inappropriately and leaving the victim, as it were, iron- but more importantly oxygen deficient. I came across a most compelling, but poorly documented case that occurred in Old Mexico City. The year was 1919.
