Leather seats of my Cadillac started to adjust to buttocks of elderly Alexander. His younger brother was getting ready to enjoy my two bedrooms apartment. Aunt Olga was right! Don't make love in the bed in which you sleep. I bought it on sale at "Argus." I was not the first time for me to cross the desert. Knock on the wood. My rosary get used to it. And doomed fate forced me to take holiday... ...on French Riviera with my friend Ralph... ...big swindler, who holds my left hand... ...and his wife Mary, with whom I share bed when her husband is away... ...holds the right. Relax, honey! When you find yourself a girlfriend kiss her from me with passion. It all started more than innocent. That day, Ralph and Mary were invited to the party... ...and they decided not to leave that poor thing Matthias alone at home. - Well, go on! - May I? - Fifty-fifty! - Thank you. - You are beautifully shaped! Yes, I know! Bring me a drink. Same one. - And precisely? - A large glass, two ice cubes, some vodka around them and strong wet kiss. This minute. - Liz! - To me, he will not drop it. - Not bad. - I drink only water. - You're wearing too much. - Okay, I'll go home to change. - Would you come with me? - Why not? Could you help me choose the color of the beach oil? Why not? At first I wanted to have two bikes instead of one. Aunt Olga always told me: "You're Gemini and the twins are born not by coincidence." And now you're wearing too much. If I pull this ribbon, than what would happen? By the way, let me introduce myself, Duval. My name is Matthias Duval. Liz Kerner. - You live in Antibes? - No. We have a large villa in Cap Ferrat. - In Cap Ferrat? Not bad. - Yes, awful. - Who is "we"? - What? You said: "we have a large villa in Cap Ferrat". Me and my sister. - I hope she is as nice as you? - I hope. We're twins. I got instantly hooked. It was an omen. I read in my horoscope, but untill now... - Twins? - Something wrong? - What? - Something wrong? No, no, no... Just interesting coincidence, that's all. - What a coincidence? - I have a brother. We are also twins. - Really? - Honestly, I have a brother. Matthieu. My carbon copy. Why did I say that? Phrase jumped accidentally. Little innocent lie, nothing else. I had no idea where this will lead. And who pulled my tongue? I did not sleep whole night. You're such a scumbag! - If Ralph in the end... - Leave Ralph. Ralph, in the end, no matter what, is good for nothing You can't imagine how my life has changed since I started work here. I do not think anymore that I'm a lawyer. Hello! Please! - That's her. - Who? Don't play stupid. Be nice, make me some coffee. -Yes? - Who was this? - My housekeeper. - She has a bitchy voice. Subtle observation. - I would like to invite you to the party. - When? - Tomorrow, around 8. - Good. Okay, I will come. Don't put too much cloths on yourself. - She has a bitchy voice. - Yes? She said that yours is tender. Go, have a drink? This time you are wearing too much. - I don't understand. - I wonder what's there? Ah, you've arrived. This is the guy I told you about. - So you're the sister. - You guessed right. I'm stunned. But you have a twin brother, too? Yes, yes, yes, of course, of course. But I have never seen such an identical twins. Let me introduce myself, Matthias Duval. Betty Kerner. And me? Let's go and have a drink with me. A glass of MoÃ«t & Chandon. So this is famous Diamond Castle, about which Aunt Olga buzzed in my ear. There is clearly smell of money. No profits but inheritance, capital. Secret chests, in which I always dreamed to dig. Mother was from Brittany, father from Boston. Old France, New England. - And you... You are? - Liz. - I took from both of them. - And your sister? - Betty? She... - I have two native languages. - So you decided to have all-night vigil? - No. Rout. We want to sell villa to a Texan. - Sheriff asigned me a job. - So they don't just happen in the movies? - Not bad villa. - We do not want to live here. This villa belonged to our deceased parents. - So you're an orphans? - Yes, starting December 31st. - Liz! - No. Betty. - I'd like to meet him. - Who? - Your brother. - My brother? Matthieu? I think you would like each other. You have a lot in common with Matthieu. His name is Matthieu and your Matthias? Name Matthias is a derivative of St. Matthieu, who replaced Judas at Jesus. - Well, my sister is entertaining you? - She's very passionate of Judas. And not just Judas. - Please. - Yes, mademoiselle. Remember. - You remember! Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall, Humpty Dumpty had a great ball. And all the king's horses, And all the king's men, Couldn't put Humpty together again. - Who won? - Bye. I hope to see you soon. Come join us sometime in the evening. With your brother. Why not? Why not? We go to the second floor. What a lovely evening. As always on Wednesdays, business matters called me to Paris. So and Ralph... I choose Wednesay for this reason, believing that he will not resist the temptation to pay for my ticket. - You're so nice to Marie. Arrived plane from Nice, flight 537. My company "Crazy Joker"... ...specializes in producing exquisite greeting cards. I think about drawings and send orders to prolific illustrators, voracious printers and distributors, suffering from amnesia. Therefore revenues represent a failure of memory, and vice versa. - Hi! - How are you? Look what I bought you. I'll take it... Hello, this is Charlie. Bastard! Scum! Aunt Olga, I'll not kiss you today. I think I caught a cold. - Hi! - Current issues. So, you will be surprised. Accounts. Rent. Security. Fire protection. Optics from Bergman. Your new contact lenses. From a year ago. No. No, dear... you know. - You'll take me to the cleaners. - You're quite disrespectful. - Damn it! So you're here, you son of a bitch? - No, I left. You left for those whom you own more than a thousand. - Over thousand for indecent pictures. - I'll skin you! You raise the hand on the weak? Who of us wears glasses? Enough playing fool. Get money, before I'll rip your head off! - Hurry! - 500 now, 250 in some time. - 800 immediately. - 750. Write it down! I could be as false as your cheque. I found what you wanted. For January, 1st. Which section? Obituaries. Here. Albert Jack Kerner and Elizabeth Kerner died in a car accident. Famous Boston financier and his French wife... ...died during ludicrous traffic accident... ...leaving two daughters, Elizabeth and Elizabeth. What? Mr. Kerner acquired considerable wealth... ...third largest producer of paper, owner of several television stations. - Let me think... Betty? - No, but you are, Matthieu. - Yes, yes, exactly. Stupid Matthieu. You've never seen her before. - Careful. - Thank you. Stairs. You see this step for the first time. In general... this house. How nice is here. Matthias told me that you sell the house. Sorry. We already have a buyer. Yes, yes, exactly. - Please. - Sorry. I put the glasses on and become different man. Different. Polite, cautious, timid, soft. Anyway, my brother is a jerk. And why I took it into my head to portray such a nerd. - Monsieur. - Hi. Good day. This time mistake is not possible. You're Betty. - And you Matthieu. - Yes, yes, exactly. You don't look like your brother. You, on the other hand, look exactly like your sister. - I think she's prettier than me. - Nonsense. You are dazzling! Could we go? I've made a reservation for 8:00 o'clock. Yes, yes, exactly. Have a good time. - Bye. - Bye. - But she...? - No, she's gone. Liz appears and disappears. She's a "freeminded woman." I don't speak in English. "Freeminded" means "willful", "open", "emancipated." - So, we can go? - Let's go. Nice. - How charming. - I never been here. - Me, too. I like this intimate corner, it brings people closer together. - How true! - Yes, yes, exactly. - Please. - Thank you. - Could you? - I'm sorry. - Thank you. - Please. Thank you. Here. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. - Good evening. - Good evening. - No, we drink only water. - You will not have a drink with me? Well, only one glass, because after the second... - This one. - Very well. - The same as the madam. - Yes, sir. I do not smoke, thank you. I know that you and your brother work together. Yes, yes, exactly. I am the publisher, working the first three days. Matthias last three days. That's all. What a verve! You asked me what are my plans, Aunt Olga? I confess. All my life I dreamed of sleeping with the twins. Preferably rich orphans. - Book publishing? - Not exactly. - Please. - Excuse me. We make greetings cards. Something like UNICEF cards or reproductions of Pompidou Centre. Facinating. - Thank you. - You write the poems? - Yes, no, no... we have professional writers. - What? - I write poetry. Really? Politeness is an art of offense, but there was no escape. I had to ask her to recite some shit. Really? It's understandable. During the journey through the Orient I composed a few haiku. - Excuse me? - A genre of Japanese poetry. - Well, you know, five, seven, five? - Ah, yes, yes, exactly. Five-seven-five... Yes, yes, exactly. - Do you really want to hear it? - Can't wait. Step on the scaffold, and forgive the executioner, After all, he didn't know. You are like me, you are my twin. Every word. - So similar. - Stunning. Stunning. Good morning, honey. I made you some coffee. Which one of two? And who am I? You need glasses? Getting warmer. Glasses, then I'm Matthieu. So you are... Betty. Did you lose your tongue? And head like a helmet, looking out of the trench. - Excuse me. - I had too much yesterday, terrible migraine. For migraine the best remedy is massage. - You can't stand an alcohol? - Yes, yes, exactly. Without glasses you look like your brother. So beautiful. This is the only reliable way. Not in my Dad's bed, you understand. Yes, of course. But last night we did... - We? - Don't you remember? Of course I do. I remember you, but I don't remember where. On the big couch in the lobby. On the stairs, in the bathroom... And on a pool table. - What a strange choice. - That's how you promised me. - I promised that? - This is our secret! Wait, wait, wait. We have a secret? - In the billiard room... - So? - I asked you... - I remember. - And you said "yes." - I said "yes"? I asked you to get married. - And what I said? - You said, "Yes, my love." - And we got engaged. - Engaged? - When Liz comes back, do not tell her. - Why? Then it will mot be a secrets. I have to go to work.Only three days. Come back soon and do not forget. This, you will never forget. My fiancee owns 80% of the world production of paper pulp, 7 TV stations... ...pyramid of crispy dollars. Matthieu become fiance. Shouldn't he confirm his existance. - Hi! Is this Liz? - No, this is Betty. Hello, it's Matthias Duval. Do I have a chance to talk to my brother? Matthieu? He just left. Got into a taxi and left. Oh, shit! I mean, I'm sorry. - Is Liz at home? - Not now. - Okay, I'll call her later. - Bye-bye. - Let me introduce myself, I'm Liz Kerner. - What? - Is Matthias home? - Oh, my God! Let's change this for that. Your place is in "Playboy's" centerfold. Brothel is closed. Get out of here! You too. Forgot where the door is? - Let me introduce... - Marie! - You just came in? - I ride the horse in a nearby estate. - Get out! - Marie, what about Ralph? - Don't worry about Ralph. - But, Mary, Mary, I'm... Exit is there. Get out, now! Come on, Liz. One moment more and I'll explode. Oh, Matthias. -Do you have any plans? - Some. To die from the heat in Paris, to watch for the 15th time Bogart's retrospective. - Where are you going to sleep? - I can sleep in the office for now. - Your apartment burned down? - I lost it... lost and won the tenant. You see, when Matthieu returned from Canada, he had nowhere to go. - Matthieu is a jerk? - He is my brother. But not mine. You come to us. - I'll sleep in the maid's room? - No, in my bedroom. I want you to be always around. You perform better than the others. I should have jump on the first plane and to go to the office... dig in in a sleeping bag, and to end sensless comedy with the twins. But honestly... I wanted to stay here. Aunt Olga told me many times... "Go away, Matthias, stop playing while you're winning." Easy to say. I was never able to stop at the right time. Although, I owe everything to my brother. Starting with the fact that he passed my spoken exams for the bachelor degree. I betrayed him in the city garden with his first love. - And she didn't recognize you? - Of course she found out, how not to? You always leave yourself as the villain? Dear Betty, where there is good, there is always an evil. He's the good one. Are you coming? Betty without enthusiasm reacted to my stories. I gave her a Parisian's phone number of Ralph and Mary, knowing that there is no one to answer. Every half hour, she tried to call... But apparently no one answered. I suggested that she could catch her fiance in the office... ...on Monday morning. Damn! - Hello! - Mathias Duval. Evie! Your homosexual. - Hello! - Whom he had in mind? Get off, Mathias, I'm watching TV. - And what is on? - We watch "Love Story", you wouldn't understand. Tomorrow morning, one lady will call the office and ask for my brother. - Your brother? - Yes, Matthieu. Matthieu? And you tell her that he's at a meeting of UNICEF. - What? - Or at the Center Pompidou, she will understand. Yes, Pompidou is so much better. - I have no time. - And what your brother should do? - To call her back. - Always your tricks. Evie, it's just a small lie to save the love. I don't know what are you talking about. - Hope he drops dead, that fagot. - I have to go, my husband calls. Ok, my eye will not even blink. And everything went as planned. Betty called Matthieu, who called her back from a payphone on the beach. - Oh, Matthieu! - Oh, Betty! Oh, Matthieu, I wish it was Thursday. Do not forget about our secret... and birth certificate. I will not forget, my love. It's only thing I think about. Can you imagine, us, together for three days. And three nights. The other nights I'll stay with Liz, who, I should admit, also didn't let go. Anyway, on Wednesday morning, I was relieved to get on a plane. One day to relax at the office. Goodbye, Liz! How do I love men, who leave in the middle of the week. I am one of them! Ernest, I hope you had time to prepare contract? For this reason I wrote the new inscription for a postcard "Christmas comes once a year!" I'm happy that you feel better!" Monsieur Duval, there's Monsieur Volpinex to see you. You... or your brother, Matthieu. Do I have the pleasure to speak with Matthias Duval? - That's me. - My name is Ernest Volpinex. Nice to meet you. I am attorney for Kerner's Family. May I? Please. Besides greeting cards what else you do? - Why: "Liz Taylor is not rich?" - The times are hard. Why: "My tailor is not Richard Burton?" We can't live without humor. If you want to see Brussels, press. - Very funny. - You want to buy it? - We all sat together at the table. Shit! It's the guy from the party. In my home, around Antibes. You've probably seen me. Party. Where I met Liz. - Can I smoke? I hope you drop dead! Please. - May I? - No, no, not there. Thank you. You live with the Mings? He is a brilliant lawyer. You were invited by Marie Ming, I mean the Mings, and your brother, Matthieu was...? Abroad. In Canada. I'll print you my testimony in three copies. But I didn't understand. What do you want, Monsieur...? Volpinex. It think, I gave you my business card. - And what I should give you? - Nothing, Monsieur Duval. I just want to make sure that neither you nor your brother... are hunting for fortune. Monsieur Volpinex I suggest you to stop subscribing to the "La Figaro." And you will not have such a bad presumption about others. With your level of education, I would have brake you in half. Oh, well! Black belt in aikido, seventh dan in karate. Yes, of course, understood. It is necessary! You know that the sisters Kerner recently orphaned? They are so fragile. Well, we're here. My brother and me. Well, yes. You're to some extent, the owner. Thank you. Very funny. Your company is capable of supporting one brother, but two? Would die of hunger. I understang. You're also chasing after their wealth. - What? - For which of the two? Liz? Or Betty? Duvall, you can be sure, I will do everything in my power... ...which I have massive amount... to rescue these girls from yours and your brother's claws. I'm very glad that I met you, Monsieur... Monsieur? - Volpinex. - Volpinex. Take two before a meal, abstain from alcohol and from women Do not reduce the prescribed dose and call me if you don't get better... Don't take me as your tour guide around the Kerner's house. - See you later. - I don't need a tour guide. After work, I'm playing in a casino. I know. I should have thought before. But there're things that you don't tell to women. Your gave me bounced cheque. You can eat it. I asked Betty in the name of Matthieu to lend him two thousand. I told her that he has invested all his money in the pacifist movement. I have not finished my lies, as she gave me three. Okay, I ruined those you asked me, what do I do next? Do you remember the poster, painted with illusory dollar? - So what? - That was a really artful. - We almost got jailed. - But it was artful. And still, we almost got jailed And I didn't get any money. Wait. Bithday of mother-in-law. What, if we write this: "If you don't like your age, pick yourself the one you want"? - What to create? - A blank birth certificate. - Blank one? - Here, take mine. Copy all the signatures, carefully forge the seal of Municipality. This is basic. Then, it'll remain just to fill it out, and mother-in-law will be again 20 years younger. - You don't like your age? - You can choose any. So, the mothers-in-law. How much would you to pay? - It'll pay itself, from sales. - 500, will be ready by the evening. Charlie, it's one hour of work. Stock Exchange will not pay this much. - 250. - 300. - Good. 300 at the end of the month. - 250. Now. The same evening, Charlie brought the false form. You couldn't tell the difference from original. I wrote the data from my birth certificate. Matthias, 7:27. Matthieu, 7:39. Easy, Matthieu. I gave you life. Now you exist. Matthieu! With the birth of Mathieu life became intoxicating rac... ...into the crazy dessert. How strange, Matthias envies Matthieu. - Look, there's Liz. - What? Damn, she wears her new bikini. And how strange, Matthias envies Matthieu. And there's a "Black Prince." So that's how she spent the weekend. They go crazy, when they learn that we're getting married. - Yes, yes, exactly. - On Sunday, I'll go to Paris with you. - You don't like it here? And who I'll be on Wednesday? - Who you will be on Wednesday? - I'm going to be Madame Duval. - What? - I have arranged everything. - Isn't that wonderful? - Awesome. Come on, let Liz stays here alone with Matthias. - Awesome. Awesome. Yes, but how Matthias could spend three days with Liz... ...if Matthieu goes to Paris to marry Betty? For the first time since the beginning of this story I wanted to have a twin brother. Let ask for Matthieu. No mother, no father. Fast. And why it takes so long? What is he waiting for? Well, it's even better. Hoax with the twins sooner or later will surface. And then - goodbye, millions. Hello? One minute. Matthieu, it's for you. Me? Who? I'm sorry, who's calling? No, let me. I'll take it. - Matthias, is that you? - Matthias! This is Matthias! Concierge apparently is not awake, yet. Instructeded me to call Matthieu. - It was my fault, I got confused. - Well, at least I have a phone number. - Disgraceful. - Did something happen? - What a mess! You got me upset, man. - What happened? Why I got you upset? Matthias, are you OK? - This despite the fact that the dollar goes up. Yes. Why did you ask to call you? I didn't ask you, but I'm listening. - I got it, tell me what do you want. - Yes, yes, exactly. - You have a girlfriend by your side? - Decide for yourself, buddy. Kiss her from me. Well, what do I do now? - Hang up the phone? - Yes, if you please. No, Matthias, that's why I flew from Canada to help you. Yes. Speak... louder, and then I have here... Yes, yes. Okay, kid, I know. OK. Yes. Yes. See you on Wednesday. Bye. - What happened? - It's Mattias. - I understand, but... - Problem with taxes. Numbers - his weakness since school, he has to stay at work for a few days. - Liz will be very upset. - Ah, Liz? Poor Matthias. I so wanted him to be my best man. Betty arranged everything. She introduced me to Wonderland, like the frightened girl. And I survived my wedding in some kind ecstatic amazement. And since Matthieu Duval - thoughtful, intelligent, refined man. In one word, beau... Betty, dear, what's the rush? Well, I would have been the first playboy in this blessed country, well, then fine. I knew, why I get married, but did she? Will I hide my cocker spaniel's eyes? Yes. In the name of the law now pronounce you the husband and wife. So, not enen two days had passed, and Elizabeth Kerner became Madame Duval. Dream of the young girl become reality. Yet Betty, what's the rush? Why the rush? I'm not to old to eat the mustard. But where is my hot dog? The next day. My dear, sign this and now all what's mine will be yours, as well. What's the hurry? Don't worry, everybody is at your service. - Good morning, sir. - Monsieur... newspaper, please. Thank you. Good day, sir. - Oh, good morning! - Good morning. It's me, Liz. Make yourself at home. Soon you'll graze your sheeps on our pastures. Sponge behind you. - Betty knows you? - That I'm in Paris? No, Betty doesn't know. I decided to catch Matthias in his lair. I called your secretary four times, but she said that he hadn't returned from lunch. - But... you can't go without lunch... - France is a country of gluttons. To eat for four hours. And you? When you leave for work? Work during honeymoon? But Betty will get angry if I betray our secret. - I had a small dispute with Matthias. - Dispute? - Matthias is running business... how should I say it? - The way it is. - Bypassing morality. - Morality in business? Asshole!! You're unique. You should offer your body for scientific research. Hello! Still in the restaurant? How many desserts he takes? Tell him I'm coming. Carlos, go get me a drink. Oh, it's you. Tell Carlos to make me a drink. No, no... I'll do it. A large glass, two ice cubes and vodka around. A wet kiss is evidently prepared for the other one. So, the first line, 2206. So, vodka. Damn! - Wait! - Oh, so sorry? - I'm talking to the tailor. - Use another phone. So... sleeves, the sleeves, the sleeves. - Kerner's residence. - Liz Kerner, please. - Liz, are you in Paris? - Ah, it's you. How many desserts did you have? You are my dessert. I'd like to see you tonight. Tonight will be difficult, Princess. You got a date? She is young and naive, her father wants to invest 50 thousand. That's what I like about you, you have no problem to lie. - At 11:30 at my place? - For this I'd have to stand up on my ears. - Would you like to talk to your brother? - Matthieu, he's with you? Nicky, go tell Monsieur Duval, his brother wants to talk with him. - OK, until the evening then. - OK. - Monsieur Duval. your brother is on the line. - Oh... okay. I got it! - Hello, yes? No, Matthias, don't get involved in it. - Yes, yes, exactly. No, no. Trading books - three times more expensive. No, no, it's unethical. Ethical. I'll spell it: E-T-H-... Damn! Forgot the ice. Angel fell down from heaven... Stubborn heiress. Kiss me, my love. Right now, kid. My lovely girl. The instructions said: one capsule. I used a whole package. So, I can't play on two boards. I throw two fishing pols... ...and Matthieu caught larger fish. Stop fishing, Matthias. You're, unlike Mathieu completely immoral. After all, he grabbed the trophy as the first one. So long, Madame Duval. Go ahead! It's time to end up with Liz. Without sentiments. - Just on time. - Who would dare to make a woman wait? - You decided to break up? - And what you decided, Liz? We had 4 or 5 times sex, and then smoked 60 cigarettes... ...exchanged hundreds of pleasantries. Even complete idyll has an end. - I have another suggestion. - To go to bed? We can do it right here. - You only think about it. - I try not to think. But if I think, it's about that. You sure, you don't want to read it? - I read a book once, didn't help. - Well... so long. I'm going. Look... just for a moment. You'd like it. - What is it? - An offer to get married. Both of them? Betty yesterday and today, Liz. I tend to lose my head because of women, but not to that degree. Why me? Why not a trumpet player? - You're perfect for this case. - Why? You're poor, frivolous and not bad looking. - Who told you that I'm single? - I made some inquiries. With those who prepared the contract? Volpinex didn't price my skin very high. - $400 a month to play the role of your husband. Fucking bastard! I told him 4,000. - Well, 4,000 sounds OK? - Let's see. Article 1. Sexual freedom for the wife and the husband. Everything is predicted. Divorce. Wow, nothing forgotten. My death, yours... In any case: $4,000 adieu, farewell Matthias! No, Liz. Precautions must be mutual. I make the offer only once. - I don't love you. - I don't care, it's strictly business. - For $4,000. - What do you take me for? Goodbye! And now it started to rain! Why do I need this crappy contract. Matthias! I give you two minutes to think it over. There's something wrong. What is all this circus? If I will not get married by the end of the year, I will lose $3 million. - Taxes? - Yes. Well, how to put it? My father really wanted us to get married. - And Betty? - What Betty? - She should also get married? - Leave Betty alone. - I want to know the big picture. - To shit with your big picture. You have one minute. Then offer is withdrawn. Betty grasped me with tenderness, but, obviously, she had the same goal as Liz. I got it. This is a marriage of convenience. Matthias! Think fast! I don't need wet husband. Matthias is gone! There's no more Matthias! - $4000. - So "yes" or "no"? Damn! Wait, wait! $4000 a month? Four a month? For five years, right? This is...? How much? How much that will be? This will be 240 thousand dollars. 12% net profit a year... plus... Wait... multiply times two. So it will be $482,725.72. You know, why I can't refuse? Because you're like everyone else. You don't need a lot. - What? - No, you need everything. Tireless Betty. As the fiancee you're as goood as the lover. - And as the husband? - Not so fast, Matthias. Matthias!? Shit! It's not Betty, it's Liz. It all happened with lightning speed. I signed the damn contract, she ordered champagne. We took a taxi, went up the stairs. This bed, this woman, and finally I said to myself: Time to go, I have to disappear. And I fell asleep. What the hell! I fell asleep! Idiot! If I'm in bed with Liz, who wakes up Betty? - Something wrong? - I'm sorry, I have to go. What I like about you is, that in fact you're romantic. I'm waiting for you on the other side. So. - Is this you? - How did you sleep, my love? - I have a migraine. - Don't move, I'll get some aspirin. - What are you doing? - I'm coming... I'm here, my love. - Wy I have a such a headache? - From champagne. Yes, probably, it had a weird taste. Here, have a drink! - Go to sleep and I ran. - Come here to me. You awaken hunger in me. Animal hunger. I know, I know. Let's get some sleep. It's the best medicine for migraine. My love! - I'm sorry, I have business to take care off. - What? - You see, I'm... - You said, you'll be quick. Well, I must use... - When you gonna dress? - Later. - Well, are you a little better? - I'll tell you later. Matthias leaves the shower, then Matthieu has to find some time for ... ...Matthias to dress, Matthias gets out, go through the pantry... ...and Matthieu has to jump in the car, in the arms of his beloved. Piece of cake. - Are you talking to yourself? - I need to take a shower. See you soon. - Hold on. - What is it? - Glasses. Lenses plus glasses. You were so dirty? For $4000 a month you deserve perfectly clean husband. - Would you like a breakfast? - No, no, I have to run. I wouldn't want to meet with Matthieu. - Where will you be today? - It's hard to say. I'll call you. I keep thinking what I'd do if you wouldn't sign the contract. Nothing, you would fell in love with me. Don't forget the birth certificate. - Matthieu! My heart! - Yes, my soul. Here I am, my love. I'm coming. - Honey! - Just one small... Shit! You were so dirty? You don't have a rich husband, but at least clean one. I'm going, I have an appointment. - Something happened? - No, nothing. - Small problem. - Hurry up, my love. Bigamy. Article 340 of the Criminal Code. From 3 to 6 years. What do you want, Aunt Olga? The little man risks of becoming a big idiot... ...that instead of big profits grabs small amount. $4000 for 5 years, isn't that enough, Matthieu? We must get rid of my brother. It is necessary to put him in the freezer. To get a salary at least one more time. - Volpinex called. - Shit! It's your second blood test result this week. You're not sick, are you? Shit! Charlie wants to know, whether your like a birth certificate? Not what I expected! - No, wait, I wanted to tell you... - Leave me alone. Shit! Hi, Olga! Get away, Matthieu! Hide, leave! Now you will not be able to pass me exam for the bachelor. Yes, I know, I know... To marry another one is pure madness. Matthieu has to vanish. He has to disapear. Let he returns wher he came from. To Canada. To Canada! To Canada! - You called me? - Yes. No. - What is it, Matthias? - I'll explain later. - Call me a taxi. - What is it? Taxi, shit! Yeah? Matthias! Well, tell me, where have you gone? Can you do for me small investigation? - Problems? - No... nonsense! I'm getting married. - Matthieu! - Matthieu! - Mathias! - Oh, it's you, Betty! - He's not with you? - No. What is it? What the matter? Shit! Sorry, Betty! - What happened? An accidant? - Worse. - Matthias, I will not let you go until you... - Do not ask. Betty. You will not like my answer. - Do you mean that...? - Yes. No. He has another woman? Don't judge him too harshly, Betty. He met her in the Fourier commune in Montreal. What? She is now in the hospital. She tried to commit suicide. She needs him. - But he could write to her? - Where? - Montreal. - Yes, but she can not read. Why? She jumped from the second floor on a parked car and... ...most likely she'll remain blind for life. - Well, let's call her? - Yes, but... - First thing, where is Matthieu? - We had terrible fight in the morning. He slammed the door, and then, an hour ago Professor Kladon called. She threatens to repeat the attempt, if he doen't come back. - To marry her? - No. Matthieu doesn't want to get married. No, no... She just wants to see him. No, I'll tell him. - Betty, it would be ideal... - He needs to go there. Thank you. - I will go to Canada with him . - Wait a minute... No. Wait. No. - Maybe you still go with me? - No, dear, it's all settled. I talked to your brother, you have to fly alone. Yes, I guess it's better by myself. I wouldn't love you, if you wouldn't be so generous. - Bye, Betty! - Come back soon! Good title for an article: "One twin hides the other." Compared to this, the play of suicide scene in Montreal... ...was a kid's game. Miniature golf. - Hello, Nicky! - It's Duval. - What? No, Matthias. - Liz at home? - Ah, it's you. - Well, how is my love bird? - Am I beeing invited for the evening? - Do you have a tuxedo? - I borrowed one from Matthieu. - I'll take you to the opera. Even worse. - What you are planning, Matthias? - I'll explain later. - And your brother, how is he? - He took care of both of us, thank you. - Well, how did you like it? - Who? - Opera. - Hot. By the way, when is the wedding? I decide that. Article 1. - Now what do we do? - You do whatever you want. I'm leaving. - Excuse me, for a minute. - Wait, wait. Are you for real? - Have I ever lied? - Read the contract again. Yes, I remember. Article 7. Sexual freedom. -Good evening! - Who let you in? - No, I have my key. - Your key? Liz gave it to me. Well, you can not just walk in into someone's house. And into other people lives, and other people plans. Ubiquitous Volpinex. "Man in Black". You are indestructible. No film is complete without your presence. Have a seat since you're here! But certainly you're welcome to leave immediately . I came to talk about you to leave. - Well, I like it here. - No... I mean to leave forever. Ernest, I will marry Liz. Soon I'll become a part of the family, my dear. Duval, your family belongs to the second class. Ernie! - Hallo! - Hi! You will not be bored. You have here all, what single man needs. Good night! Such a monster! There are times when I am capable of murder. Good evening! Betty! - Are you alone? - Liz is meeting with her lawyer. Sometimes she lacks common sense. - Any news from Canada? - Yes, Matthieu called me. He sits by her bedside. - How is she? - I think better. He couldn't talk for a long time. I see. - I had never seen you like this. - "Like this"? What do you mean? Calm, serious. It's strange for Gemini. Why strange? So similar, and at the same time is so different. Liz and me, you and your brother. - In your opinion, we are so different? - How should I know? You ever wanted to perform scientific experiment? - In what sense? - To understand the depth of the differences. - It would be interesting to find out. - Are not you afraid to be dissappointed? I read in her eyes, "yes." Just to reach out and take her. She was not mine, but I still reached out for her. Suddenly, in the midst of our passion it came to my head. I'm competing with myself. This thought grabbed me so deep, that I literally... - Strange, isn't it? - Yes, strange. I thought about you and your brother before. - Really? - Incredible, it feels like Matthieu. - And you know everything. - It would be better not to know anything and be myself. You are deceiver. - So what do you think of the difference? - Long live the difference! - What do you think? - Close your eyes and I'll tell you. You are better! Me, better. Me, better? Better whom? She got married only four days ago, and already cheating on me with another. Shit! Well, you aren't the other, and yet, you aren't her husband. If you are to some extent not her husband, then she doesn't know about it. In other words, one of us is a cuckhold. Cuckold? Betty, who was with me, quite unlike Betty, who was with Ma... ...with Matthieu. That is, with me. With the other. Shit! Very confused! You better. She sang the praises about my navel. I wonder why my belly button is different from my brother's? God, what am I saying? What am I saying? Why someone always takes your achievements in love? Am I in love with her? In love. Betty, it's me, Matthieu. Matthieu from Montreal. What a night! I think of you. I love you... I miss you. I can not live without you. I think I love you. Here, I confess. Yes, I love you. I'm coming back I'll arrive tomorrow morning. I love you. Matthias! Matthias is 11:00 pm! Get up quickly. Ralph is here. - What day do we have? - Monday. Shit! I'm arriving in half an hour. Ralph! Yeah, well... What were you saying? I made inquiries about the sisters. - Twins! - Twins. - So you already know? - Start from the end. From the end or the beginning it's all the same. They are legally not eligible. They are legally not eligible. - What... not eligible? - To take over legacy of the Kerners. No more words. No. No, wait, wait. Look! Sit down! Sit down! Listen! To get access to the Kerner estate. To get access to the Kerner estate, they must get married. - Yes, taxes, I know. - How much in taxes? Three million $! Smart trick to get around administration taxes. Come on, explain it to me. Basically, old Kerner was a true Puritan. He believed in family values. To get to the safe, they must first go to the City Hall. But there is one catch. The old man had a twin brother. He left them the same amount. - How generous. - 45% each. - But that is the case. - I don't understand. Shit! How much is: 45 +45? - How much? - 90, so what? The one who will get married first, has the rights to buy 10%... ...which gives you controll over Kerner empire. Do you understand? - Who owns 10%? - Kerner's twin brother. - Uncle Timothy. - And what uncle Timothy says? - So far, uncle Timothy says "no." - Are you awake, dear? - Why did you lie to me? - What do you mean? - About taxes. - What? - Taxes! You married me... ...to save three million dollars in taxes. - Yes, it's true. My sweet heart, my love. - And what about the inheritance? - What, my dear? - You and your sister are getting 45%. - Who told you? - Matthias? - Liz has no secrets from him. - Dear. I hid from you only a part of the truth. - Liar! - I'm not a liar, I love you. Why then you slept with my brother? He told me all the details. Matthieu, nothing would have happened, but... you are so similar to each other. You admitted? At the same time, there's nothing in common. - Oh, indeed! Why he's better? - I'm sorry. - Betty, I can not continue like that. - Matthieu, no! - I do not know, where am I? - I love you! - I see darkness. - Forgive me, in God's name! - Leave me, leave me alone! - No, I love you, Matthieu! - No! - Leave me, leave me. I'll call you! - What are you doing so early? - You didn't pay the cleaner for two months. Someone has to pay the bills. - You wear glasses again? - No, I lost one contact lenses. One day glasses, another contact lenses. What does opthometrist say? Contact lenses can not be abused. Same with double game. Matthias! Can you explain what's on your mind? It's on your mind. Fantasies it's your main problem. Hello! Monsieur Duval? Yes. Which one? - Matthias Duval speaking. - Oh, Betty! No, Betty. He left 5 minutes ago. Yes, he looked depressed. No, he didn't explain anything. Well, I know him. He always behaves like that, when he's sad at heart. I assure you, Betty! I did not say anything. - Your brother went on vacation? - What? - And he didn't take you with him? - Well... So what should I say? Wedding is tomorrow. I'm sorry. Your brother is not here? - No, no, and it's better this way. - Are you leaving? - Yes, yes, exactly. Goodbye! - Bye! - Will Matthias be in the office today? - I think he's somewhere close. August is almost over... ...and totally exhausted me. Three weeks. Three weeks I run in small circles. It is time to stop. Stop, stop! So, Matthieu married Betty, but if I omit some details... ...I can repeat all with Liz. It's a chance to get jailed! So... Stop, stop! No, stop! - How far? - Three hundred thousand kilometers. Three hundred thousand kilometers between us: the mountains, glaciers, boundries. I don't love you, Liz. - You signed a contract. - It becomes legal only after the wedding, But there will not be a wedding. - Did you fell in love with the cashier at the supermarket? - Yes, I know, Article 7. - Sexual freedom. - No, I refuse. Around you many bachelors. They would love $4000 a month and rights to your bed. So why me? Men from my society will not understand it... And then, they would never agree to such a conditions. - $4000 a month? - It is not even enough for the cigarettes. Volpinex? Why don't you marry him? - I'm afraid of him. - At least we have something in common. No, I'm leaving, Liz. Bye! I can't let you go, Matthias. I need to get married, otherwise all is lost. I know, but Matthieu and Betty are already married. Betty? Bitch! Are you sure? Last week in Turin. Bitch! Wait, Matthias, wait! No, no, do not write anything. It is unfair, wait. Wait. Hello, "Air France"? What time Concorde is flying to New York? Wait, that's not fair! It's against the law! - We're getting marry after lunch. - What? - Do you have a blood test? - Not all is lost. - Uncle Timothy loves me more. - No, wait, wait. You're playing not fair. On Long Island after the statements you don't have to wait. We'll be married in fifteen minutes. Yes? Departure from Roissy at 11:00 am, arrival in New York at 8:45 local time. Well. Well, thank you. No, no... You can't do this to a poor man. No! No! Have you tried to ignore the cheque, who landed, like a dragonfly... ...down on your desk? I felt with me finger every zero. What time should I arrive at the airport? Roissy 2. Charles de Gaulle Airport. 11:00 am. 8:45 am. Local time. New York. JFK Airport. 9:18 am. The Brooklyn Bridge. 9:40 am. Fairfield. Connecticut. 10:15 am. Newport, Rhode Island. 10:26 am. 10:34 am. Newport. City Hall. - "Yes, I do". - And I "Yes, I do". 01:00 pm. JFK Airport. New York. Roissy 2 Airport, 10:45 pm. Aha, hallo. - Bye! - Bye, Madame! Good bye, Monsieur! Leave me alone. I am married to two wealthy heiress, and I spend my wedding night... ...one on one with the hot dog and a can of warm beer. Chears! It would be so nice to have Betty on one side, and Liz on the other. What I'm mumbling? Talking like being in love. Love? Only this wasn't enough. - Liz? - Liz! - Betty, I'm... - Where is Matthieu? - Why did you tell him? - Wait a minute... how did you get here? Your secretary gave me the keys. Where's Matthieu? You fool! Bastard! I wish you were dead! If I were a man, I would kill you! - But, Betty... - I hope you drop dead! You fool! Bastard! I love him! I love him! She loves him? What a miracle. She loves me! - You started renovation? - I'm leaving. - What? - I am going away. - Away? - To Japan. What did you forget in Japan? You can't stand raw fish. I think, you do not understand, Evie. Matthias, do not scare me. Are you serious? He wrote something for you. That is, I wrote it. - You'll be a manager. - Say what? - How can I do without you? - Here. - Real one? - Liz Kerner is a sponsor. - She is crazy. Yes, it is possible to feed the entire world with this. "Crazy Joker" now acquires a new image. - Farewell, Duval! - All that because of the twins? Last night I saw the second one. - I want... - No, don't say anything. I already know too much. I, Matthias Duval, will write Liz from Tokyo, where I never set my foot... ...a love letter, and will announce our final break up. This will be my first literary experience and my last trick. Matthieu will be back with Betty. The plane will take him back to Paris at 11:50 am. See you soon, Betty! Yes, darling! What? My favorite color? Red. Why? Do you like it? Behind glasses of those glasses I spent the happiest four days of my life. I no longer needed to fear. No more to be myself. Now I'll be just him, Matthieu. This is me. - Look, there's Liz! - What? Building castles in the sand? The waves would wash them. Is that what you want me to say? Yes? I heard that you got married, and I came to congratulate you. Well, hug. - Moreover, me and Matthias... - What? - No, you... - Yes. We also got married. Matthias is married. Wow! Let's celebrate! - Mathias isn't with me. He is in Japan. Yes, what he forgot in Japan? He ??hates raw fish. We need to talk about money. Uncle Timothy died. - Did you...? - No. - What are you talking about? - You can't keep it, for God's sake. - Oh, my God! - What was that? - Are you crazy? It's loaded! - Loaded? Put it down! It is faulty. It can shoot by itself. This is my father's gun, He couldn't unload it. - You didn't know? - I never held the gun in my hands. - Carefully! - You scared us. - I'll make some arrangements for a dinner. - Do we have something to celebrate? - What? - The end of stupid quarrel. Okay, I'll go. - Matthieu. - Yes? - Why Matthias left? - To Japan? - I have no idea. We had a fight. - He writes about you in the letter. - About me? - He asked to give it to you. - Who's that? - Aunt Olga. - And it's you on the picture? - No, Matthias. - And where are you? - I... was taking a picture. - Poor Matthias. "And give Matthieu a hug from me". Thank you. And what did he write? "My dear Liz, the only one, Tomorrow at dawn I'll walk to the shore. Look at those two cliffs, joined forever by the rope... ...which stretches from one top to another". Beautiful. So, beautiful. "The atmosphere is calm. I would like to walk with you in this silence, and hear your moans. Absorb bliss lurking behind the screen". - Lurking what? - Behind the screen. "True happiness can be felt only by this who is in love. But there is no happiness... I never told you that I love you..." Liz. He never told me straight "I love you." - Liz. - Matthieu. I think, I love Matthias. Liz! I want to go. Take me away, Betty! - Liz! - I want to go. I'll take her. She wants to go back to Paris. - Should I? - No, stay. I'll be back. Betty! Betty, I'm up here. Betty! Betty? Matthieu Duval? - Yes, yes, exactly. - Who are you. Monsieur? - And what do you want from Betty? - Professional secrecy, Monsieur Duval. - Are you not her lawyer? - And you... are you not your brother? - Excuse me? - You don't have a twin brother. Well, you have seen him? Matthias Duval and Matthieu Duval is one and the same person. Everybody portrays someone. It's important to do something original. - Liar! - I'm a liar? - No, I came up with his own life. - Your lie was exposed, Duval. Climate of our prisons will do you good. - I do not understand? Prisons? - Bigamy, forgery, fraud. Believe my words, it will get you 10 years. - And my brother, what he will get? - Duval, you are one. One is more than enough. I have a statement from maternity clinic... ....where it says that you were born only once. Your aunt Olga filed out application for subsidy for just one Duval. And I have a duplicate of your schooling record. -You got caught, Matthias Duval. - Don't touch me. - Ernest! - Don't call me that. - Don't touch me! - Maybe we can find an agreement? - Defend, monsieur. Your marriage to Liz and Betty, destroyed my plan I've worked for years. Enough Volpinex! - What a pleasure! - Stop it! - I do not know if I can... - Stop, Volpinex! Stand up, Duval! Well, take it, Matthieu. Go! Kill me, Matthias! - Don't joke, Volpinex, it is loaded. - It doesn't matter now. Five years more, five less, what's a difference. Come on, Matthias! Go ahead, Matthias! Enough, shit! Volpinex, wait! No, oh, no, no! No, no, no. Shit! Volpinex! - Matthieu, it's Betty. - Betty, it's Matthieu! - What happened? - Nightmare, you woke me up. My poor boy! Listen, me and Liz have to solve one small problem. - Betty... - I will not be back tonight. - Till tomorrow, then. - Betty. I wanted to tell you... - Betty, I wanted to tell you... - You'll say tomorrow. - Good night, my love! - Betty! Damn it! Damn it, damn it! Damn! Shit! It's Gilles Schnyder. 6:30 pm.

Police suspects that the murderer was Ernest Volenpix... Member of the Paris Law Association... Shit! Shit! Shit! Known to all residents of Saint-Tropez. Thanks to documents found in his car... Experts could compare fingerprints and are rather certain... ... that Volenpix is the killer. His whereabouts are unknown. So what? Rates go up? Aunt Olga! It is time to break the bank. Thanks, Ernest! Thank you! Madame Balaram! There are days when a mere trifle can bring great benefit. - Evie! - Yes, Monsieur? - What do I do now? - I think you need to come back from Japan. - Nicky is Matthias! - Is Mademoiselle Liz home? - I'm calling from Japan! - Hold on. Miss Liz, it's Monsieur Matthias from Japan. - Excuse me, Inspector. - We're finished, madam. I will not keep you. Everything is alright. Tomorrow morning you'll get permission for the funeral.

How did you... You are so alike.... And at the same time so different. We had no time to be together. Matthieu! He ??overcame so many obstacles... ...and returned from Canada, to die in Trouillas. Betty! He loved you! - I know. Liz, Liz! My letter... You never spoke to me directly that you love me. I brought you some souvenirs. - But of course, now is... - Inappropriate? No, Matthias. It would be nice. Wait. This is for you, Liz. A little one is for Betty. How lovely! My God, beautiful! Sorry, I... - What is it? - She is in shock. Go and wish her good night. - You think? - Yes. - Betty. - Yes. - I'm sorry, Betty, I'm... - Come in. I came to wish you good night. Good night, Matthias. I will never forget... Do you remember our scientific experiment. - Betty. - Kiss me. Oh, Betty! Be reasonable. - Matthias! - Go. - Matthias. - Yes? You're really better. How is she? Poor little Betty. You should be with her Matthias. How Matthieu would have comforted her? - Yes, but... - Today, dear, I will take care of everything. - Well, how was Japan? - Well, the cherry trees are blooming... Tatami, quartz watches. No, no, no, I'm... - Liz. - For our love! Liz, I love you. I love you. - Oh, the lemons! - Fuck the lemons! Liz, I love you! Liz, I sit on his lap! - Say again. - I love you, Liz. - More. - I love you. I love you. What is it? Wait, wait, dear. Here. Well, that's all. Shit! Betty! Liz!

Right away. Liz! Liz! Mathieu was in a full sense of word "dreamer". And dreams do not live the old age. He had no chance to love and be loved. Small urn with ashes, which can not be identified. There is his destiny. He rests in the family crypt... Beside the ashes of his parents-in-law, in Boston, Massachusetts, USA. The funeral went well. Honeymoon, too. True honeymoon. Poor Volpinex! I dedicate you my new card. Walk in paradise, until the devil wouldn't catch you.. And we will cultivate our earthly garden. All the best in this best of all possible worlds. My wife, my widow, and myself live happily ever after. Mommy!
