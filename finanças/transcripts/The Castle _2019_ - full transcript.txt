THE CASTLE Mum... We should think of a name for ourselves. I mean it. -What about... "Music Ladies"? -Oh, stop it. No, I mean it. Or... "Singing Women". Or "Bread and Circuses". What do you think? -I don't know... -No, really! -What? C'mon! -I think we are not a band. Then what are we? Mum! We really should have a name. Good evening to all of you gathered here tonight at the Lithuanian Community Centre of Ireland. Welcome to the International Day of Cepelinai! To those who have Irish husbands or wives, I'd like to explain that... Cepelinas is not only a very delicious traditional Lithuanian dish but a true symbol of Lithuania. But before we eat I'd like to invite you to listen to some music. Recently arrived in Dublin from Lithuania, they are sure to make it big! Welcome on stage... Monika and Jolanta! -Good luck. -Thank you. Good evening. I'd like to add that my mum is a professional pianist and I've been singing since the age of four. Tonight we'll play just five songs, but if you'd like more dn't hesitate to come and book us for a concert. I'm tired. -Good luck at the fish factory tonight. -Mummy, tonight I'm off. Don't pay any attention to her. Monika, that's not very nice. Hey, Monika! Over here! -Hi. -Hi. We're going to McDonald's. I've got no money. Me neither, but my mum works there. She'll feed us for free. -I can't go now. -What are you doing? -I want to play some music. -You can play later. But I have to play now. Whatever. Let's go. -Bye. -Have fun! Mummy, put this on. We're late. Mummy, do you hear me? -Hi, Blondie! -Hello! Going hunting? -It's a keyboard. -A what? An electronic piano, you know? Roland. -Hello! -Hi! Bye! Wait a minute, OK? I'll be done in a sec. -I need three. -That was the last one. Do you have any? -She's not in on this. -No? -What are you not in on? -Ay... -Tell me... -I'm not stealing fish. Hey, how is it going man? Want some cigarettes today? I'm electric now. Fuck man, those are even more harmful to you! -Hey, you want some? -No. Babushka? Sorry to interrupt but we are late for the funeral. Do you understand me? Nobody is going to die if we are late. Coffee, cigarettes, just give me a call, okay? Did you know, the dead guy worked at our factory? Chopped off his own head. -Whack, off it went! -By himself? Yeah, with a chainsaw! -Will they send him back home? -What do you mean? Will they send his body back to Lithuania or bury him here? I don't know. -I guess it doesn't matter. -It does matter, Zita. He was born in Lithuania. He should be buried there. Maybe they'll send him back then. But it must cost a fortune! Not sure Ryanair takes dead bodies. Thank you. Hello everybody. -We are called the "Musical Darlings". -Monika, don't! It was so beautiful. Funerals cost an awful lot of money these days. I'm totally broke. -But please accept this. -I won't take the ring. No. -Jolanta, I'll feel bad otherwise. -It's alright. Really. Thank you, darling. Thank you. Enough. Let's go back inside. How much do you think we could have got for that ring? Monika, just forget it. Mummy. -Are you tired? -I am. Let's go sit down. Those musicians must be well paid. Mummy, why are you crying? Let's go. Mum, that man from the other funeral is coming. -Good day! -Hello! I overheard you sing today. You were extraordinary. -Thank you. -I'd like to book you for a concert. Mum, come. Mum! -Hello! -Good day! The concerts are held in the castle. One of the best music venues in Ireland. Elton John thought it was alright. Mum, we're invited to play at a castle, in the best hall. -Elton John played there! -Do you know this man? So, ladies! Sir, who are you? Liam Maguire. Music Producer. Mr. Maguire. Everybody is looking for you. Everybody is always looking for me. I have just invited these lovely ladies to the castle. The castle is an hour and a half's drive from Dublin. We'll leave in the morning and come back in the evening. We'll have a program of one hour, no break. -I assume it's ten songs. -Goodness me! You're lucky! Show me his card. Liam... Ma-guire? -Maguire. -Maguire? Looks like gold leaf. -And the coffin was gilded too! -Of course it was! -It was paint! -Jeez! -Jolanta? -What? Look, she's not talking to us any more, she's going to the castle! To play with Elton John! A chicken leg please. The word is drumstick. Cool. Thank you for the drumstick. -You're welcome. And for you? -Some chips, please! This app tells you how good your voice is. Sing. C'mon, c'mon! Enough, enough! Hey, singer, it's a joke! -Hey! -Hi! -Adam, do you have cigarettes? -Will you stop firing at the cats?! Take a look... "Blue Valentines, Somewhere over the Rainbow," "Whiskey in the Jar, Happy Happy day..." I gave the keyboard away. To who? Who did you give it away to? To the community centre. But why did you give it away? Come, mummy, it's time to eat. Mum, why did you give the keyboard away? God, mummy... Mum. Use the fork, mummy, OK? -Mum, why did you give it away? -Eat. -Why did you give it away? -Mummy, use the fork. Why did you give it away? -Eat, mummy. -Why did you give it away? But we're going to the castle. Mum... No, Monika! We are not going to the castle! Got it?! We are not going! Monika, I've been all day with her. I'm going to go crazy. Can you help me?! Come on! Come on, Granny! Holding hands, we'll surround Lithuania. This is not Lithuania! You're in Ireland! And nobody's going to take you back to Lithuania. Ever! Lithuania is there! Beyond the sea! Beyond that water, get it? Granny! Where are you going?! Granny! C'mon, please. What happened? We went swimming. Monika, are you out of your mind? Come, mummy. God, you're all wet! Monika, get changed! What happened? Get changed, you'll catch a cold. Make some hot tea. I have to go to work. -Hiya! -Hello! And ciao! -Good evening. -Hi. -What's in the box? -The fuck do I care? Looks like a cake to me. Did Zita make the cake? Of course. She keeps on making them. Then I have to be her delivery boy. Where are you taking it? To the community centre. There's a wedding or something. -Good evening. -Hi! I wanted to ask if I could borrow the keyboard for a few days? I need it on the 17th and 18th of June. -Sure. -Thank you. 100 euro and it's yours. One day 50, two days 100. But my mum gave it to you!.. Not really, I translated that contract for her. Are you taking the instrument or not? Mum! -What's happened? -Nothing. So why are you here? Zita, do you mind taking the bus on your own? We'll walk home. Sure. -No problem. Bye. -See you. I've rented the keyboard. Mum! We'll take it on Sunday and return it on Monday. I work on Sundays. -But you don't work Sundays. -From now on I do. Why don't you quit that job? -Monika, how can I quit my job? -Quit your job and come back to music. I'm not coming back to music. What do you mean you're not? Monika, I'm tired of starving. I want a job that's paid. And not in gold rings, but money. I want you to study. I want us to go on holiday for once. Then let's go to the castle. We'll get 500 euro! There'll be Liam and lots of other producers! I've been playing for 30 years and I still have to work in a fish factory. But you don't have to work there. If I didn't work in a fish factory we wouldn't have a roof over our heads! We'd be kicked out the way Lena was! Then I'll go on my own. OK? Go then. But I need 120 euro. For the keyboard and the ticket. Mum! -Monika, I don't have 120 euro! -Yes, you do! It was my keyboard too. The keyboard was mine and I gave it away for free. I didn't get a single euro for it. Is that clear?! Actually, you used it to pay for some stupid translation. Without that stupid translation we would be living on the street. -Hello! -Hi! That's it? There's fish in the oven. Did you steal it? I bought it. Help Granny get washed before bed. See you later. -Yes? -Hey, do you want cigarettes? -No, thanks. -Come on babe, just one pack? I bought yesterday! Yeah, but today is a new day and new day is a new life and a new life should start with one pack of cigarettes. Come on, just one pack? Okay. Give me one. One! Fuck off! Love you too babe! You want? I don't smoke. Why not? Buy a pack for your mum. What about Babushka? I get it. She is on heavier stuff. You can say that by the look in her eyes. She'd like... Okay, I'm off to look for better customers. -Adam? -What? Do you think you could possibly lend me one hundred and twenty euros? I gotta go! What? -Hi, blondie. -Hello! Do you think you could possibly lend me... What? Some milk? -How much do you need? -How much can I have? -A glass, or two or three? -A glass is fine. Okay. -Here. -Thank you. -You like Tchaikovsky? -Who? This music... It's Swan Lake. You don't know? Who is he? This is Stephan my son. Five years and six months. -What about your job? -What? Nothing. I'm no slut! I'm a dancer! Keep it. Look! See? Every euro I make I send home to my husband. You know what he is doing with it? -What? -He is building a house! And tomorrow I an off to Poland to visit them! Check. Is there nothing on my face? -Clean. -Clean? Okay. Ciao! -Natalija? -Ciao! What? -There are so many people here! -Of course there is! -Alright there, bud? -Not bad there, Miss. -You don't drinking yet? -Not yet. Come on! You want a coke? -Orange juice. -What? Orange juice! One orange juice and no vodka, please! See? They are dancing here. -Thank you. -Cheers! Mad! Mummy... -Bye. -See you. Check to see that Adam's not shooting again. Nobody's shooting. Bye! -Hi, blondie! -Hello! -What are you up too so early? -School. Yeah... Leaving? Yeah. -Where are you going? -Nowhere. Nowhere! Going back to that fuck? Watch your mouth, asshole! Does he know you earn money to buy all of this shit? Does he know how you are getting your money? Does he know? I'm asking you, tell me, does he know? -Shut up! -No, you shut up! You shut up, okay? And give me my hat. -Don't worry, okay? -Okay. Listen, blondie, what are you up to with Adam? -Nothing. -Be careful with him. Listen, could you look after my flower? -The heart-shaped one? -Yeah. What else? You have to water it every day, one quarter of a glass, clear? -Every day. -Okay. -Don't lose it. -Thank you. Hi! Hello! We are suppose to rehearse here. Could you wait until I am finished? Not really. No. it's our time now and we are here the same time every day. You can't keep her locked up. She's better locked in our flat than in some smelly old people's home. There are nice homes here in Ireland. I'm not dumping my mother in any care home. Mummy, sit down. And how's little Miss doing? Bad. Why, what's up? I don't have anywhere to rehearse or money to rent a keyboard. Listen... Why don't you just quit this music? Come with us to the factory. She's laughing at us... You could ask for weekend shifts and work happily. You'll have a proper occupation, a bit of money of your own. No more problem! So? I'm a singer and I don't think it would be good if I stank of fish. Do we stink to you? Hi! -Where are you going? -To rob a bank. Can I come? -Can I come? -Come where? To rob a bank. I really need some money. Yeah. Money, Money, Money, it's always about money. Can you move aside? Hello? Get in! Take the hook. Take it! Take this. Now go. Go and take the shit out! Like this. You see. Go. Come on! We'll go get more! Just get in car! Get in car! What do you need the money for? To rent a keyboard. For a concert. You kinda like music, no? Kind of. -Hello there, young lady! -Hello! What can I get you, love? Could I possibly use your piano? Not sure it works. It's older then life itself. Here you go. Yeah. That's it. Seven euros? Yeah. What did you expect, four million? Not a million, but more than seven euros. Go home before your mom makes a scandal. Go! -Bye! -Bye... Let's go. Let's go, Granny! -Let's go home. -No. -I said let's go. -No! Stop it! Granny, stop it! Monika. Monika. Where's Granny? -Are you listening? -Yes. Where's Granny? I don't know. God knows where she went this time. -A sim card, please! -Sim card, which one? Which is the cheapest? The cheapest I have is a Lyca sim card. It will cost you six euros. Is that okay? -Yeah. -Six euro, please! Thank you. -Thank you. -Thank you. Babushka is all right and will be returned in exchange for 500 euros, which has to be hidden under a bin on the overpass near Dart Station at Seapoint Beach. Come with me. -Did you find Granny? -No. -Hello! -Monika, come here. -Monika. -I'm coming. Was anybody here after I left for work yesterday? No. Did you two go anywhere? No. Did you lock the door for the night? -I did. -Are you sure? I don't know. Babushka is all right and will be returned in exchange for 500 euros, which has to be hidden under a bin on the overpass near Dart Station at Seapoint Beach. Friday, no later then 4:00 p.m. If the police is called, Babushka will be dumped into the sea. -It says Granny was kidnapped... -We know what it says. Jolanta, where are you going? Jolanta, what are you doing? -Yeah? -My mother... -Pardon me? -Give! -Give what? -Give! My mother... -What's this mother... -Give! Now can you get out from my flat? Can you step outside from my apartment please? -Crook! -What, what did you call me? Your Mom is totally crazy, no? Calm down, Jolanta! Jolka, c'mon... I have barely 80 euro. We bought a new couch yesterday... I'm broke. Listen, let's go to work. You can ask for an advance. -They won't give it to me. -Sure they will. When you asked they said no. Let's go to work. You'll ask and they'll give. -You think? -Sure. Monika... You'll have to stay on your own tonight. You'll be fine. Just lock the door and don't open it to anyone. If Adam comes round, call police right away. 999. Understand? Yes. Granny! Let's go! Let me take it off. Granny... Don't go anywhere. Granny... Hold it. Sorry. Okay man, I'm getting in. -Hello! -Hello... The police are arresting Adam... -Jolanta! -Stay out of this, Zita! -And what are you going to tell them?! -That my mother was kidnapped! And you expect them to go looking for her? You'll bring trouble to this whole block, Jolanta. Talk to the cops and in a second an army of them will be turning all our flats upside down. -Everyone's fridge is full of fish. -I don't have any fish in my fridge. Go to the cops then! Mum. The kidnappers said if we called the police they'd drown Granny in the sea. And if the cops find her, they'll send her straight to a care home. Granny. Wake up. Granny. Granny. Jolanta... I brought you food. Take it. Let me clean you up. C'mon Granny. Let me. No. That's it, Jolanta. Not a penny more, Jolanta. It's over. Take it, Granny. You should be ashamed of yourself... Granny. I always said you were lousy. Pianist, pianist... Loser. Hi. Would you like some coffee? There are eggs if you want. Guys keep it down, will you? The girl has a concert in two days. -Where did you get this fish from? -I stole it. Pass me the bags. On the shelf. -Do you have the money? -Some of it. -Where will you get the rest? -I'll steal some more. Maybe you could borrow the rest? Maybe you could borrow it from somebody? Mum! From who, Monika?! Tell me who's going to lend me 500 euro? What if the police catch you? If they catch me, they catch me. I need to use the bathroom. Come on, Granny. I'm taking you home. Let's go. Please. -Let's go! -No! Come, mummy. -Let's go, mummy. -No. Let's go, mother. Mum. I was bringing her back. Mum. I was already bringing her back. Please. Let's go home, mummy. Get away from me! How is it going? You see I got out! The fucking policeman won't get me! Motherfuckers! You are not in the mood to talk? Hey what's wrong? Mum! How do you like your new home? -My little baby. -Shit. Mummy will dance and you'll go to school, OK? Good morning! Blondie! Did you move in here or what? I.... -What happened to your face? -This, it's nothing. This is Stephan, my son. Stephan, say: "Hi, Monika!" Hi! Mummy, please, eat! Take it, mummy. Won't you be late? Do you really have to tear them off so roughly? So where are you playing? At a castle. -For the president, probably? -Yes, for the president. Hey, it isn't all here. It's all there. -Yeah, it's all here. -It's all there. Are you really playing for the president? Yes. Mum. Mum. Granny. We have to go, OK? Come. Granny, hurry up. Look! Come. Lucas, look at me! Okay? You're alright. Lucas... Breathe... Lucas. Maureen, hurry along now. Please. Liam... Liam! Are they here already? Your remember Monika? She's here for the concert... -I hope you like it. -No, Liam. She is here to play. -You want me to play? -No. Monika is here to play for you. Of course she is! Monika. Wait! I understand you are upset. But people here really care about music. Monika? If you would be so kind? -Can I take your luggage? -It's a keyboard. Good afternoon all and welcome to our historic concert hall. Here today we get a chance to listen to some wonderful music. So please greet with your applause the wonderful young talent Monika who has travelled all the way from Dublin today especially for you. Monika... Granny. Granny! Shall we go for a walk?
