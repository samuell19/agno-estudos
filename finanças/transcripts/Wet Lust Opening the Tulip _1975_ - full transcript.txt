Apparently, we have a magnet-cheater in the shop. Please watch out! Move! Move! Move! Stop! Move! What the fuck? What did I do? Say it! Don't act innocent! This machine is under my control! You are not allowed to cheat! Cheat? What did you say we did? You used a magnet, of course. A magnet? - Of course! A magnet! - A magnet? What? How dare you say such a thing? This is interesting. Prove it! Don't go! How dare you claim that I've used a magnet? Hey! Think again! People may even assume that you are the cheater. Check for yourself!. Do mine too! ﬁnd them! Check for yourself!. If you can't find any, you will be in trouble! l am your customer after all! Do you think it will be fun to be humiliated by your own customer? ﬁnd them now! Idiot! If you are wrong, you have to sell your cute wife to me! What is your excuse after making us take off our clothes? Sorry! Forgive me please! -Sorry! I was wrong! - Hey! It's too late to apologize! Please forgive me! Sorry! It's my fault! Idiots like you make me puke! - Idiot! - You have to be punished! -You damn liar! -Sorry! Bastard! Please forgive me! I really thought that they were using magnets! Why do I always do stupid things? It's okay. Everyone has unfortunate experiences from time to time. It could've gone worse. You... You've always been kind to me, ever since we had lunch together as 7th graders. If you keep consoling me like this, I might fall in love with you. No, you're wrong. I merely care about you. There is nothing more to it. I know. I know. I know I am popular among girls. Well. I can't say this or that about other people's business... I might have to use magnets one day too. Did you know? Yes, I am no novice to the pachinko business. I hope you don't turn into a dubious person like me. Why didn't you tell them? Because you don't want to hurt our relationship? Do you really think our relationship means that much to me? We are just two lowlives. If you get busted, you will be beaten almost to death. I didn't tell anyone because I understood your situation. But he was desperate at that time. What are you going to do to him? My plan is just to be nice to him. Shit! Put this in... What an idiot! I've never seen any clumsier ﬁnger work than that. - Did you do it by yourself? - Idiot! At least, I enjoy doing it! Your face makes me sick. Please hide it. Girls don't like that kind of face. They would run away. Idiot! It's not that I like your face either! Why don't you jump into the water and die? Shit! Idiot! Trash! Fool! You are damaging the valuable goods! Asshole! Shit! Who is buying those nowadays? You are crazy! I can't believe you own such valuable things! Are you stupid? These are the old man's! The old man? I knew you couldn't afford them. - They look too expensive. - Idiot! I don't need a speciﬁc place to live! Unlike you, I stay at one girl's place, and then at another's! You are saying this because you don't know girls! You are 25 years old! Such a good age to date girls! ls there something wrong with you? Are you done talking? - Follow me! - What are you going to do? What is this? Didn't you tell me that you'd bring them in the summer? I'll store them now in advance. I will bring you a kotatsu and a heater next year! You store them at my place, and you go out earning money? Take good care of them! I got it. You don't have to say it again and again! What are you talking about? I have the right to refuse customers I don't like! There are a lot of girls waiting for me to stay at their place! Okay! I got it. - How about him? - He is a virgin! Pathetic! Idiot! You can't be a virgin at 25! How come you know my age? - Whatever! You pathetic idiot! - Leave me alone! Listen! You have to hit on girls ﬁrst! And think about consequences later! Okay? Don't forget it! First block, second block, third block, fourth block and ﬁfth block... Mean old man! Why did he talk to me like that? He's a faggot! He must have fallen in love with you! Leave me alone! You're mean! Even the old man pitied you. It would have been even weirder if he had pitied me. Hey! You have to follow me! What for? I appreciate the money you gave me earlier. Get in! You just have to listen to what I say! -What? - I am going to help you. Idiot! What are you going to do? - You want to have sex, don't you? - Of course I want to! But I am not like you! Do you know how to talk to girls? Actually, I don't. You just know when you do it. Leave me alone! First block, second block, third block, fourth block and ﬁfth block to make a bridge... Hello. Thank you for having me. Hello. I am a tailor. I make formal dresses. You must have seen the suit he is wearing. I make all of them. They are well-made, aren't day? Hurry! Yes. .. Thank you for having me! It hurts! I am saying it hurts! Sorry! Thank you for having me! Sorry! Sorry... Sorry... Sorry... Calm down! The only reason I do this is because Hiroshi asked me to! I know! Sorry... I don't know what to do! I don't know what to do! Please, tell me! You don't know how to have sex at all, do you? Sorry! I give UP! I can't put up with a guy who behaves like a drugged dog! I can't take it anymore! What an uncouth guy! I got it. It's over. But do me a favor! What? Could you tell him that I did have sex with you? Please! ﬁne! Thank you very much! What did you do? How pathetic! Idiot! Fool! Trash! I know! We‘ve been waiting for you! Please, come in I am Michiko, a female professional pachinko player. I am Hiroshi's friend. I am sorry for telling you what I want over the phone earlier. Are you ready to provide what I asked for? Yes, they are ready. Please start. Okay, let's start the process. Are you okay with starting the game immediately? I accept the offer. 3-ball game... Are you okay with it? Please check. They look okay. Please start. Game start! Jackpot! I lost! I've heard a lot about you from him. Apparently, you can't focus on your work because you want to have sex. Once you become a good gamer, girls will follow you by themselves! More girls! More skills! - I pity him. - But he must have good skills. He will become big! He is not like you! How dare you say such things! - Maybe this is not enough. - Harder! - Don't you feel it? - Fuck me harder! That's right. Maybe that's the spot! -This? -That's not it! Idiot! -That's it! -This? Yes! Yes! -No! - Which is it? Idiot! You got it wrong! That's it! Maybe that... That's not it... That's not it... That's it! That's... That's not it! That's not it! I failed. You were very close though! What? What? I used to be the girl boss of a gang in my hometown... but I want to become a proper woman from now on. - Thank you for visiting our business. - You look very excited. The staff at Heiwa is excited about improving our business... with the help of the best expert in Japan. Please follow me. Mister! Nice to have you here today! With your help, I've earned a lot. - Really? - You may go now. - I will call you if I need you. -Yes. Hey, we can't relax here. Why don't you go to the 2nd ﬂoor? Let's go then. Please go downstairs. I see... I followed you because you told me so earlier. And it's noisy downstairs. Also, please don't use that formal tone. Hey! Spank me! Slap me! Slap me! Spank me! Slap me! Spank me! Spank me! How's that? Slap me! Harder! Spank me! Spank me! No! Hit me harder! Slap me! - Like that? -Spank me! No! That's not it! That's it! That's it! Harder! Harder! That's it! That's it! Harder! Like that? Spank me! That's it! Harder! That's it! Harder! That's it! Spank me! Harder! Spank me! Spank me! Spank me! Harder! That's it! That's it! Spank me! Cigarette! Lighter! Although you can easily open the girls' legs, you can't make the pachinko tulips bloom. I am sorry. My own teacher rejected his pupils immediately if he thought... they'd never be able to make the tulips bloom. sir! Long time no see... That's what I want to say. Do you know how hard I tried to find you? What have you been doing all these years? Since you kicked me out to make me independent... I have been trying hard to improve my skills. Anyway, We can't talk here. Let's go somewhere more comfortable. Please, after you. No. I can't go now. Please. sir! sir! Ramen My teacher used to tell me that the left hand that inserts the balls... and the right hand that snaps, should work in sync at all times. The harmony between the left hand and the right hand brings us more balls in the end. I think he couldn't accept people who play pachinko without using their left hand. As he got older, he must have felt that there was not much time remaining for him. He must have despaired when he found that he couldn't use the old method anymore. It's a depressing story. It sure is. Men's life is just too short. Sex is not so different. The amount a man can release during his entire life is limited. After releasing the full amount, red balls come out in the end. That's the end of it. Moreover, "The End" is written on the red balls. That's the very last ball he can use for his last game. Follow me. Yes. Wait a sec. Are you coming home tonight? Isn't this where your girlfriend works? She works here! What am I supposed to do when I see her face? Horny Gentlemen's Magic Hall I know it is difﬁcult for you, but I have my reasons. In that case, please tell me the reason. I will tell you after the show. Would you follow my instructions? Yes. So no more complaints. Got it? Say it! Be a man! Mister! Mister! It's your fault! Idiot! This way! This way! Here you are. Sayuri! Look at us too! Come to us now! Hurry over here! Yes, please enjoy. Look at us too! I would rather die than break up with you - because I am a woman. Here you go... Please enjoy... Look! - Does she know that we are here? - Of course. No way! What the hell is going on? Stop complaining! Look! Look at it! I did. - Did you? - I did. Did you? I did. Did you? Now you saw it. Sleep with her tonight. What did you just say? Sleep with her. Why? I already have my red balls. I can't do it. Thank you for having me. Nice to see you. - Honey... - I am going to start. I am going to start. Too much pachinko play made me incapable of having sex with girls. The open tulips might have sucked my energy. Good! Does it feel good? Honey... Honey... Honey... - Does it feel good? - It does... It does... Honey... Let's cum together. - You have to cum too. - Together! Honey! Together... Honey... Together... Honey... You have to cum too. Now... Now... Hey! I want to become a proper woman. I really want to become a proper woman. You have to hit on girls ﬁrst! And think about consequences later! To make girls like me! To make girls like me by all means! This is a once-in-a-lifetime favor. Okay. Thank you. I love you so much that my body is burning. Please have a date with me for once. -Good morning, Mister! -Good morning, Mister! - You must be Akira. - I am. l don't know why but it doesn't open. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. I think I am your 4th father. What are you doing here? I drank too much last night. I didn't know what to do when I woke up. It opened. One. two. one. two... Oh! You're ﬁnally here! How dare you! We are a newly married couple! You spent the whole night outside! We registered our marriage not long ago, didn't we? Akira? I wanted to talk with you too. Do you want something? My payday is soon. I am going to have dates now. I need some money. You?? Honey! Honey! Give him some money, okay? Get it from your father. Don't waste it! Tsutengaku Main Street Arcade Chinese Style Soba Noodles Jiyoken Let's go. See you soon. What? This again? You look good. Where are you going? It doesn't matter where you are going. What do you want to do? You still don't know how I feel? Honey! Aren't you supposed to have a game with him? Yes. Then why are you here pushing a food truck? Why didn't you ask for a day off instead? Do you know what you are talking about right now? I would rather go somewhere else than deal with your pathetic behavior! I have been putting up with you for 11 years! Are you serious? I won't let you! I only say this kind of thing when I am serious! Honey! Honey! What are you doing? Honey! Honey! Honey! Honey! Honey! I don't like this! Hitachi Pump Makiko! I am waiting for you! As you see, Hiroshi has dozens of other girls waiting for him. That's not true! You only believe what you want to believe! I am going to tell you the whole truth! He mostly stays at the house of a pachinko girl named Michiko. Basically, he lives there having fun with her. Honey! He also has a tailor girl named Yumiko. She gives him free clothing, including suits for weddings and funerals. Honey! So what do you do? The only thing you do is to cook and provide meals for him! You are the least attractive one among Hiroshi's girls! In other words, you are nothing but a "rice-cooking girl" to him! - A rice-cooking girl? - Yes, that's what you are! Honey! ls it true? Honey! Honey! Human beings need something more than luxurious clothes and houses. The meals you make are delicious! You are the only one who can make them. That's enough. Don't you think? That means I am just a rice-cooking girl, right? No! You are not! If no one made meals for me, I would die. What can you do other than cooking rice? Rice-cooking girl? You are laughing at me! I don't want to live anymore! l am going to die! I won't let you die! I would rather die than be called a rice-cooking girl! I have nothing to say to you anymore! I am going to die! Bye! - I am going to die! - That makes me so happy! - I am going to die! - Die! - Hey! - I am going to die! Makiko! I can wait here forever! I am going to die! I am going to die! - I am going to die! - Idiot! Wait! Just let her die! If you have time for this stupidity, why don't you go... to the pachinko parlor and practice some more? Let's go to the pachinko parlor! Do you really want to be killed by me? - I am going to die! - Idiot! Wait! - I am going to die! - I am going to die with you! Honey! Idiot! Fool! Honey! Help me! Honey! Help me! Honey! Makiko... I know you will come. I know you will deﬁnitely come. Makiko! I am waiting for you... Honey... If love is this painful, l don't want to love anyone. I can't forget... Honey! You are a good guy... Honey... Now I know you love me! It's so hard! Yes, I love you. It's so hard! You really love me! You followed me into the water because you love me! That's right. But having sex in a situation like this is nothing but a hellish experience! I am okay. I am in a paradise! I am in a paradise! She hasn't come, despite the fact that I've been waiting for her this long! No matter what I do, I am just not popular with girls! This is hell! A living hell! Shit! This is hell! Girls! Girls! Girls! Akira! - Akira! -What’s up, mom? People are looking at us! Stop it! - Akira! He is dead... -No way! He looked very healthy the other day. A car accident? -No! That's not it... -Suicide? That's not in. I am talking about your real father. There is nothing I can do about him though... Such an idiot! Idiot! What's up? What?! What's up? My father passed away! This shop... He was the owner of this shop! This is very overwhelming! Please come with me. Come in please. Please go ahead. Please go ahead. What is this? I have no tears at all. Say something. Please. - He is the lawyer. -Yes. Please read this. - What is this? -This is his will. - Am I supposed to read it all? - Yes. Please explain it to me. What am I supposed to do? To make it short, he bequeathed everything he had to you. But this will be valid only if you get married. - Marry? - Yes. He lived alone since he separated from your mother. He had been very lonely, and he knew about you. He felt bad about you being a virgin. - A virgin? - He didn't want you to live like that. So he wanted you to use the money to get married. You have to get married by the deadline if you are still single. In other words, the deadline is Tuesday, November 11 at 9 AM. If you get married by this date, you will inherit 88,700,000 yen in total. - I see. - Here it is. Thank you. 88,700,000. .. - What date is it today? - It's November 10. - It's tomorrow! - By 9 AM? 9 AM, the time when the city ofﬁce opens. It's 88,700,000 yen!

Can you do it by tomorrow morning? I can make it! There must be at least one girl I can marry! Well... You have 88,700,000 anyway. There must be a girl or two who would marry you.

A total of 88,700,000. I see. Please consider it. Thank you. Sorry. It turns out I had a father after all, but he passed away. Come here. I've heard you are going to inherit a fortune. I am happy for you. I am really happy. But I don't know if I can get the money. This might sound stupid, but I have to get married in order to inherit the money. - Come here. - Yes. What's the problem? Just do it. Do you know a good woman? Yes, I do. Please introduce her to me. I have to get married by 9 AM tomorrow. Well... I can marry you. But marrying you is not an option. Please forgive me. That's not the right thing to do. Sorry, please forgive me. -What's the big deal? - It's not right. It's not right. - Please forgive me. - Why! - It's not right! Please forgive me. -Why! It's not right! Sorry. Sorry. Please forgive me. Sorry. Please forgive me. It's not right. Hello! Hello? First block, second block, third block...

Akira! I can't take it anymore! Wait! Akira! What? Would you marry me? I can become a good wife for you! But you are his girlfriend! I don’t care about that pathetic guy! Okay! Okay! Just let me consider it! Just let me consider it! They all say they'll consider the offer, but they don’t respect it in the end. Who do they really think I am? How miserable. Sorry. It's an airy, white body... It's about time to do it right and with guts. God is not always generous. - How about me? - I can't marry you! I know you are frigid! Okay! It's ﬁnished! Makiko...
