It's off to bed with you. Now remember, you have to be asleep when Santa arrives. But, mom, dad promised to read me a Christmas story. Heh-heh, That's right. I did. Well, alright. But just a short one. (Dad) 'And I have just the one.' Come on, son, hop up on my lap. [panting] Sorry, Goober. There is not enough room for you too. What's the name of the story, dad? It's called, "A visit from St. Nicholas." Oh, I like that one, I think. [dad clears throat] "'Twas the night before Christmas "and all through the house '"not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse.' '"Stockings were hung by the chimney with care' 'in hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there."' Stockings! I knew I forgot something. screech I forgot to hang out my Christmas stocking. Now, where did I put it? Aah! Here it is. Hey, Goober, Goober. I forgot to hang out my Christmas stocking. Quick, give me a lift. Shhh! Not so loud, Gumdrop. "He spoke not a word but went straight to his work '"And filled all the stockings' '"and turned with a jerk.' '"And laying his finger aside of his nose' '"And giving a nod' '"up the chimney he rose.' '"He sprang to his sleigh' '"to his team gave a whistle' '"And away they all flew' '"like the down of a thistle.' "But I heard him exclaim as he drove out of sight. "Merry Christmas to all and to all a good night." Shh! [yawning] I sure hope Santa Claus answers my letter, dad. I'm sure he will, Timmy. I sure hope so. Well, Goober, we better be asleep too before Santa gets here. [yawning] Well, it won't take me long to get asleep. [snoring] Hmm-hmm, boy, he wasn't kiddin'. This is gonna be a wonderful Christmas. Santa's coming.. ...the Christmas tree is lit, the stockings are hung and there's Timmy's letter on the floor.. 'Timmy's letter!' Oh, my gosh, it must have fallen off the table and never gotten mailed. Timmy will be heartbroken. Goober, wake up! Wake up. - It's Timmy's letter. - Quiet, Gumdrop screech Go-o-ber-r! Goober, Goober, Goober. Duh! Wha-wha-what's goin' on? Uh, is it Christmas already? Merry Christmas. No, it's not Christmas yet. It's Timmy's letter. 'It never got mailed.' Oh! That's no problem. We can mail it in the morning. [snoring] The morning will be too late. Santa's already on his way tonight. And if he doesn't get this letter Timmy will be heartbroken. In fact.. ...he might stop believing in Santa Claus. - That would be terrible. - A catastrophe. Oh, yeah, but what can we do, Gumdrop? We gotta find Santa and deliver Timmy's letter before it's too late. Yeah, we gotta find Santa. [instrumental music] Hurry up, Goober. We haven't much time. (Goober) 'Coming.' Whoops!

(Goober) 'There's Santa on the roof, Gumdrop.' [screeches] Quick, give me a boost. [Santa laughing] Look, it's Santa Claus. (girl) 'Oh, he's been here.' (boy) 'Let's see what he brought?' We missed him, Gumdrop. Wow! Look at that. Isn't Christmas wonderful? Yeah, but it won't be for Timmy unless we can catch Santa. Santa's been here. And here too. Let's look in that house. (Gumdrop) 'Too late again.' I don't think we'll ever catch him. If we wanna catch Santa, we gotta think like Santa. Now, where would he go next? Where there's lots of kids. Say! The Anderson's have lots of kids. Yeah, that's right. Well, all we have to do is get there first. [instrumental music] There's the Anderson's house. Faster, Goober, faster. You were right, Gumdrop. Santa hasn't been here yet. Now, all we have to do is find a way to get on the roof. Uh, how about that ladder? (Gumdrop) 'Perfect.' How you doin', Goob? Uh-huh, I'm scared. I've never been up so high. Oh, you'll be okay. Just don't look down. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa! Whoa! Oh-oh-oh! Oh, boy, we made it. Yeah, and just in time. I think I hear Santa coming.

To get Timmy's letter. Uh-oh! Oh! Oh! Oh. [grunting] [crashes] Got it. [engine revving] [horn blaring] (male #1) 'Hey!' 'What's a pup like you doing out so late on Christmas eve?' Probably got locked out of the house, huh? Come on. We'll keep you nice and warm in the mail truck. I'll just deliver these special delivery packages then we'll find out where you live. Oh, no! Goober's locked in the mail truck. [Santa laughing] (Gumdrop) 'And here comes Santa.' Oh, I gotta get Goober out. And fast. Gumdrop, I'm locked in. I know. And Santa's on the Anderson's roof. You gotta get out. Try openin' the door. Yeah, the door. [rattling] [engine starts] [engine revving] That's funny, we're moving. You must have bumped the brake. [both screaming] Turn to the left, Goober. Turn to the left. Left? Uh, uh, which way is left? Oh, no! [crashes] That's doin' it the hard way, Goob. But at least you're out. Yeah, but now we lost Santa again. We'll never get Timmy's letter to him. And it's all my fault. [sniffles] Oh, cheer up, Goob. There's still time to find Santa Claus. - It's no use. - But we can't lose hope. No one should ever lose hope especially on Christmas Eve.

(Gumdrop) 'Look at it go.' Yeah, and when Santa gets back to his sleigh he'll find the letter in his bag. (Goober) 'We did it.' 'We saved Christmas for Timmy.' Oh no! [bells jingling] [Santa laughing] How could we have failed? We came so close. But it doesn't matter any more. [instrumental music] Timmy will never get what he wanted for Christmas. Poor Timmy. Goober, you gotta stay awake. Maybe Santa will still come and we can give him the letter. You gotta stay...aw-awake. 'You gotta..' [bells jingling] [both snoring] Mom, dad! Santa Claus came. Huh! Oh, look at all the wonderful presents. There's some for mom and dad. And you too, Goober. (Gumdrop) 'And there is even something for me.' I-I don't get it. Look! Someone opened Timmy's letter. Ha-ha, I guess we didn't fail. Santa found it after all. Oh, boy, everything I asked for. Even this real special model plane. Mom, dad, did you ask for anything special? You might say we asked for something special, son. Yes, that's right. We asked for peace on Earth. Mom! Dad! Look! Santa Claus wants the same thing. (Santa) 'Merry Christmas!'
