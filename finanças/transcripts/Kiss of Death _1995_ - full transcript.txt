Oh, listen, tell Ma I said hi. I sure will. When did you buy these? They're beautiful. Bed sheets. So where are the drapes? On your bed? You got to try to find the second life in things. How's your school? Good. Hard. I would love to go back. So go. I think it's a little late in the game, no? School would be a piece of cake compared to what you've been through. Thank God for this one, huh? She saved our lives, this little girl. She really did. - How you doing, Rosie? - Hi, Jimmy. Hey, little girl. Hey, little girl, big girl. What's up? Rosie's going to sit for Corinna, do her studying down here. - Tonight? - Yeah. We got the meeting. I caught the one by work-- the nooner. We were supposed to go tonight. Yeah, but I gotta get and go to Albany tomorrow. I told you. I got to get up at 4.00, check out that body shop. Well, I think it's better when we go together, don't you? Huh. Jimmy fucked up? Mm-hmm. How much I owe? Give me a dollar. Okay. You go to the meeting. I'll watch the baby. - Sorry, Rosie. Okay? - No big thing. Okay. We'll pay you half for coming downstairs. Come on. - Come on. - Jimmy. - Jimmy? - Here you go. Jimmy. Shh! - Jimmy, I'm a fucking dead man. - What you doing here, Ronnie? I could go to jail just for talking to you. Listen, I got eight cars on a carrier, boat's leaving in, like, 90 minutes and no driver. I need your help. You are not listening to me, okay? I can go back to jail just for talking to you. - I know, I know, Jimmy. I know. - Okay... I went to three guys before you, all right? I know you don't want to be involved with this shit-- I know you don't wanna be involved in this shit, and I respect that, Jimmy, but I don't know what else to do, all right? You know who I answer to if I don't take care of this? Little Junior Brown. Ronnie, this is your problem. I don't give a shit. I mean, look what he did to my hand last week. He thought I shorted him $50 on a weekly collection. Now I got $350,000 worth of this fucking guy's cars and no driver! Jim, I need your help here. Ronnie, I have a baby inside. Everybody respects this but you. Jimmy, you having a party down there? Jimmy, I know that, but you got to help me out. You cannot come to me with this shit anymore. - You gotta help me. - Get out of here. - I mean, you know I love you, man. - Get the fuck out of here. I respect you, man. Listen, I'll give you $1,500. We'll be back in two hours. It's no big deal. Ronnie, I don't want your fucking money. Get out of here. You don't want my fucking money? Huh? I remember after your moms died. You remember that? And your father used to go on his little benders, you remember that shit? Whose people came to get you, man? Whose people came to get you? Where'd you live when you had no place to live? Where'd you live more than your own house, man? That was a long time ago. Jimmy, my family's never asked you for nothing in return, man. Jimmy, I never asked you for nothing, man. Jimmy, this guy's going to cripple me, man. He's going to cripple me. I'm your blood cousin, Jimmy, I'm your blood cousin. You know that. It'll take two hours, man. Please don't let this happen. Please, Jimmy, don't let this fucking guy hurt me, man. He's really going to kill me, man. The babysitter from upstairs, get her down here. It'll take two hours, Jimmy. Just pay her double. I swear to you. Please, Jimmy. Please. Please. - Hey, I wake your parents up? - Oh, don't worry about it. Okay. I should be back in two hours. - Okay. - Thanks. Sure. I'm telling you, Jim, man, since you went away, man, we got big, man. No more smash-and-grab bullshit. You know I got a half-size difference in my shoes and always put three insoles in the left so it fits like the right? Now when I see some shoes I want, I buy two pairs. 10 1/2 and 11. I'm talking, like, $300, $400-- Ronnie, I don't give a fuck about your shoes. - Get me home in two hours. - Hey, Mr. Jimmy. I'm talking like $200, $300 kicks, man. All I'm saying is if you wanna get back in, you let me-- You playing time games with me? Whoa. Junior, I'm your man. It's going to happen. Remove the fucking hand. I'm your guy, Junior. I'm here. There's no problem. Let's just do it. You're here, huh? He's here. We're saved. Come on, Junior, man. It's not my fault. What the fuck, man? He's a drunk, man. Look who showed up to drive. He's fucking socked. Half now. He'll throw you the rest after. No stagger. Just haul ass. What does he mean, no stagger? We'll look like a circus train. Fucking gorilla. Let's get the fuck out of here, man. Come on. Jim, what are you doing, man? We can't leave the guy like this. They'll cut his throat around here. So? Good. You know what your problem is? You're a liberal. Ready? Let's go. Let's go! I got a boat waiting. Oh... Where--where's my money? Shut up. Ooh. What happened? What happened? Hey! - Who took my goddamn money? - I said shut up! Shit. Step out of the truck, please. What's the problem? No problem. Just step out of the truck, please. - What the fuck, man? - Slowly. Slowly. I'm slow. I'm slow. Watch my hands. Keep your hands up. What's the big deal, man? What's going on? Hey! Somebody think I'm fucking stupid or something? Hey, fellas. How you doing? Hey. What's up? Mind if I see your manifest? Easy with the gun, fellas, all right? Who took my goddamn money? You want to step down out the cab, please? No! Get him! Shit! Run! Run! Go! Go! Move your hand. I'm going to kill this piece of shit. Bev. There was no need for a medevac. My man is down. I'm gonna get him here as fast as I can. You had no authority! Okay, we're going to need more of those. - Watch Calvin, all right? - Yeah, I need that, too. Thank you. Okay. Let me handle this. You're doing great. Wow. Does that hurt? What are you doing? - Who are the mutts that took off, huh? - What's going on there? - No, no. You calm down, okay? Hey, chill out. The D.A. - That's him. - You're doing great. Hey. I want the others. I don't know them. What do you think this is, huh? A possession of stolen property rap? Your partner's dead, and guess what. You're getting charged with murder. The shot cop? You're getting charged with aggravated assault. Now, you want a little air on this? Right now, give me some names. A guy called me, woke me up. Said he had a carrier for me. The driver was going to give me $1,500. - Who called you? - I don't know. Some guy. "Some guy," huh? You know you're being charged with felony murder? That's 30 for the body, ten more for the felony. Do you think that the guy who called you-- if we had him here-- do you think he'd do 40 years for you? You got a family? I don't know the guy. You did good, Jimmy. Well, what else could you do, right? What else could I have done, Jack? I could have done plenty. So, they're talking felony murder plus ten. - That's bullshit, right? - Screw them. They'll be happy with a class two grand larceny. All that other shit-- come on. - Thunder without lightning. - Class two? Possession of stolen property in excess of $75,000. You'll draw, what, five years-- serve three, maybe two. Serve two? Look, you got to take the hit. I mean... what can I tell you that you don't already know? You did it right, and they know that. It's going to be nice and easy for you inside. - Go like a dream. - What happens to my family? Do you have any idea what my wife and I have been through the last couple years? Relax. We take care of our own. $150? Yeah. Every week out of my own pocket. What the hell can I do with $150? Hey, Bev, I mean, it wasn't like he was pulling down weekly Gs out there, you know what I mean? I mean, let's be realistic. You know what I mean? I'm not made of money either. I'm just trying to help out a little bit. I can't believe this. You know, Bev, there is another way you could, um, you know, get it up a little bit. You know, if you came, you know, worked for me at the garage, you know what I'm saying? And, you know, like, run credit cards and make appointments and stuff like that, you know, it would be, you know, a strictly kosher gig. Come on, Bev. I mean, I owe him. I owe him big time, all right? Let me do this. What did he do it for, Ronnie? Bev, I swear, I don't know. I mean, if that could be me in there... - Where's the baby? - She's with Rosie. - How's she doing? - She misses you. Number five. How could you do this? I can't make it out there without you. I don't understand what happened. Bev, I felt I had no choice. They were going to kill Ronnie. We were doing okay. Didn't you think we were doing okay? They doing right by you? Doing right by me? You're in jail, Jimmy. Number five! Bobby, what's the deal with this thing? Need a 80-amp alternator, 84-17 belts. Fucking thing snapped. - We ain't got no more? - No. All right. I'll buy some. You trying to cut the drums on this? - Yeah, I got both of them. - All right. Good work. Did the kid Terry call about the Chevys yet? - Not yet. - Let me know, all right? It's fucking hot. It's like Tijuana out here. Thanks. I don't drink. - Not no more, huh? - Not no more. - There was a time, though, right? - That's right. Yeah, I remember. You and Jimmy used to be, like... partying every night, right? Well, it wasn't that long ago. What do you want from me? Ronnie! Ronnie! Yo, Ronnie! Hey, come on. What's the deal? Go ahead and ask him. Ask him! Yo, I got a '93 Infiniti. It's fully loaded. Fully loaded. - Oh, yeah? Is it yours? - Yeah, well, it is now. He ain't lying. Shit is stacked. - Oh, yeah? - Is that right? - I heard you... You heard what? I ain't got nothing to do with hot cars. Fuck you heard? I was in the joint with Vinny Passo. - And he told me that-- - Who the fuck is Vinny Passo? Who the fuck are you? I don't know you. Where you from, huh? You know Vinny, right? - You a cop? - No, man. I ain't no cop, man. I was in the joint-- We don't do that shit over here, motherfucker! Fucking shit! Hold him, Johnny! Hold him! Oh! Hey! Come here! Where you going? Come here! Fuck you, huh? What the fuck you think this is? Yo, get that car out of here! Get that car out of here! That one, too! Closing up. Out! Out! I'm fucking upset, so fucking upset. I can't take this bullshit, man. Come on, I'm going to drive you home. Let's go. Let's go. Let me get this. Where are we going? Come on. I got to go see somebody. I'll buy you a soda pop, all right? 24... 25... Nice and easy. 26... Jesus, what you been eating? Come on, you faggot. 27... 28... - Come on, Junior. - Go. 29... Ah, fuck! 31... Chief, let me get a vodka straight, and her whatever. Listen, I'm gonna be right back. - Okay. Your mother's 300 pounds. 37... Pop! Pop! I'm going for 40. Watch! - 38... - You got it, you got it! Baby, come on, come on! - 39... - Come on! And... 40! He did it. - That was great! All right! I knew you had it in you! - What's due? - It's all there. Who's she? That's my cousin's wife. Hmm... Giving her the money? Yeah, $400 a week, just like you said, plus I'm giving her a job. That was my idea. - Throw her a car, too. - A car? - Mm-hmm. - Okay. Is that it? All right. Hey, what's the what? What kind of car you like to drive? - What kind? - Yeah. Listen... I want to give you a car. I want to do something nice for you. You want to do something nice for me? Yeah. Feel good? My father says to take her home. Why don't you let her finish her drink first? Now, fucko. Why you talk to me like that, man? To her house. Come on. Let's go. Rosie, I'm sorry. I fell asleep. Is Corinna okay? No. I'm coming home. I'm coming home right now. Okay. Oh, look who's up. Fuck off! Jimmy! Kilmartin. Come in. I'll be off in a minute. Oh, Bev, no! Oh, no! She was a beautiful person, man. I did everything I could for her. I'm sorry. What was she doing in your car at 8:00 in the morning, Ronnie? I sent her from the shop to get something from my house. We were working. To get what? To get my wallet. To get your wallet? Jimmy, I swear, if that could be me in there... I wouldn't have done it, man... - Let's go. - We were working, man. Wait a second. Wait. Let's go. Could Rosie bring Corinna to see me, please? You know it was you driving that truck, don't you? - Please don't say that. - Now I got nobody. Come on. Time to go. On the morning she died, what time did Bev go to work? I'm not sure. Rosie, let me put it to you another way. What time did you come downstairs so she could go to work? - 6:00 a.m.? 7:00 a.m.? - Ah, Jimmy... She never even made it home from the night before. She called me from work. Says Ronnie's driving her. But she never made it. Jimmy, she never made it. Ronnie. I was there all night. All night long. - Ronnie. - Let's go. Okay. Your wallet, Ronnie? - Your wallet? - Come on! Come on. - Now you're giving me names? You want them or not? What do you want? Early parole? If I give people up to you and you turn me loose early, I won't last day one out there. - So what do you want? - I want to visit my daughter. She's living upstate with my mother-in-law, who won't let her come down and see me. And I want a one-day trip to go up there and see her. One day. - No. - What do you want from me? What do you mean? Like, in addition? Tell me something. Surprise me. Astro Jewelers. Remember that? - About four years ago. - Mm-hmm. I give you those people, I get my day. We'll see. John Amato, call him Johnny A. And Bobby Bannion. Bobby B. They work at L and M Automotive out near Shea Stadium. Anybody else? I think you should pick me up on this, too. Oh, yeah? Why is that? Well, if you don't, they'll know who did the talking. So, throw me in a line-up. I'll take my chances. That's all I have to say about this. Tell me about the navy yard. Same guys. Johnny A., Bobby B., and me. That's three. There were four transporters. I didn't know the fourth driver. I never saw him before. Who called you? Yo. Mr. Money. There's no way on God's green earth that you can tell me that you did not know the guy who got you into this mess. Look me in the eye, and try it. I've got no reason to lie. Everybody's got a reason to lie. Astro Jewelers? That was, like, four years ago. Who ratted us out? Well, whoever it was, you're in the clear. I was the driver. The guy never laid eyes on me. Did they pick Ronnie up, too? - Who? Ronnie Gannon? - Yeah. I mean, the whole job was his idea. No. His name didn't even come up. Did anybody from the prosecutor's office contact you about any of this? No. How stupid do you think I am? I wouldn't talk to anybody without you. Yeah. Well, they also got picked up on the navy yard thing. - Who did? - Bobby and Johnny. Ronnie, too? Ronnie Gannon. I never liked that kid. He's a fucking rat is what you're saying. Are you taking care of this, Junior, or are you going out of house? I clean up my own mess. You ever see a Rolls get chopped? No. Why don't you stay and check it out? Come on, man, I'm dying over here. We ain't got all day, man. Let's go, man. It ain't rocket science. Let's get out of here! Hey, hey! Let's go to work! We're losing a lot of time here today, man, let's get it up. Yo, Ronnie! Ronnie! Come here! What the fuck? You guys look like the Gorton's fishermen. Ronnie, I want you to listen to this. It's an oldie but goodie. Concentrate on the words. ♪ Yeah, time has come ♪ ♪ For everyone to clean up their own backyard ♪ ♪ Before they go knocking on their neighbor's door ♪ Did you hear that? Yeah. The bass was too heavy, though. The time has come for everyone to clean up their own backyard. Clean up their own backyard. Did you hear that? Wait! What'd I do? I didn't do nothing, man! What did I do?! You got something to say?! You like to talk to the cops, huh?! Huh?! Stop. Huh? You like to fucking talk, you fuck?! You fuck! ♪ From the kids on the Hill, plus my mom and my pops ♪ ♪ I came to get down, I came to get down ♪ ♪ So get out your seat and jump around, jump around ♪ Shit, Junior. Shit. Ow. I like this. I really do. Aw, man, look at this. I just bought this thing. Come on. All right. Let's get him out of here. Kilmartin on a day pass. Change your clothes in the cage. Come on. Step up. Mr. Kilmartin. We meet again. Uh, you remember old Calvin Hart, here, don't you? He sure as shit remembers you. Take the cuffs off him. I took the same bullet as you. Can I see my daughter now? - Hi. - What happened to your face? Nothing. Listen, I don't think this is such a good idea. I don't want her to see me like this. Oh, Jimmy, she's a baby. She don't... She ask for Bev a lot? In and out. Between me and Bev's mom, she's doing better than you'd think. I've been taking her to classes with me. She likes psych and economics. Math, hmm... That's great. I don't know what I'd do without you, Rosie. Corinna. Hey. Hey, you. Hey! Hey, you. Come here. Corinna, do you know who I am? Just for one minute? I know. Ma ma ma ma ma ma ma... Okay. All right. Don't take her away from me. Daddy, it stinks in here. It smells like soup. Soup, huh? Three more weeks. Hang in there, kiddo. Yeah. Coming out to what? No job, no money. At least I got you, juicy, right? Yeah. I want to get your parents something for getting me the apartment back, too. And you got me. What do you mean, I got you? Ray, get your ass over here! Yo, Red. Give it up! Kilmartin, report to the five building by-pass. Kilmartin! Come on in. I hear you're coming up for parole review next week. I also hear you've been a pretty good guy in here, and I think that's great. What do you want? Did you ever hear of an asshole by the name of Little Junior Brown? Think. What about him? Little Junior... his old man, Big Junior... He's in the hospital. He ain't coming out. So it looks like Little Junior's moving up in the world. Big Junior. That's one of those expressions like... jumbo shrimp, huh? Listen to me. I am not going back to that. I am not ratting on anybody else. What's done is done. You can't make me do shit. We never swung the hammer on you for the Astro job. Get the indictment on me. Look, all I got to say to you-- Yeah, I know, all you have to say to me is how you already cooperated with us, ratting out the others, and here we are, dropping it on you anyhow because you won't do any more ratting. You know what? You're right. Forget it. We probably won't get the indictment, and you'll be out on the street... a free man. How long do you think you'll last out there once the word gets out? Are you a man of honor? Sure. See, let me tell you. All I want now... is what I had in my life before all the fuckers came through the door-- you and them. I want to be left alone with my family, and I want a job that feels good to me. So, if that means I need to deliver up this Junior Brown, I'll do that. If I have to kill this motherfucker to get there, I will. But all I've got is your word. So I'm asking you, if I serve him up, as a man of honor, would you say to me now that you will cut me loose once and for all time? Absolutely. Do you want my hand on it or something? Let him pass. James Kilmartin. - Rose D'Amico. - Here. That's my daddy. Let's go. - Daddy, look! - Hey! Corinna! What the hell's the matter with you?! - The car almost hit me, Daddy. - I know. What the fuck is your problem, man? My father's dead! My father's dead! Get it out. Come on. See the brother here with Junior? His name's Omar. Omar is down with some posse out of Philadelphia. Must got cash long as train smoke, 'cause he's Junior's biggest customer. Cars, drugs, guns... he's buying everything he can get his hands on. So when you hook up with your scumbag pals, I want you to get them talking about Omar. He must be kind of new in the game, 'cause the Philadelphia P.D. - ain't got no jacket on him yet. - Wait, wait, wait. Fuck this guy Omar. You said Little Junior. This is about Little Junior. Look, like if you get in some conversations, you know, just relax. Don't push for nothing, all right? Guy starts talking, just ask for more details, but nice and natural. Two assholes talking shop. But don't push, all right? And don't initiate nothing, all right? Yeah, you're going to be fine. Just fine. Look, we in this together, man. One for all, all for one, right? Okay, slow down. Slow. There it is. There. The Lexus. Right there. I hate dogs! Little dogs, big dogs. Let's get out of here. How you doing, J.J.? See that guy in the red shirt over there? This guy right over here? That's our connect in the DMV. We throw him a license number, throws us back anything we need. Swear to God, sometimes I think we've got more shit than the real owners. - It's a beautiful thing. - No kidding? No kidding. Now, you see her? The Indian? I just love her. She's nice. No. I love her. We're engaged. I want to grow old with her and shit. You know what I'm trying to say? You remember me? Yeah. I heard you lost your wife. I lost my father last week. What do you think is worse? Losing a wife or losing a father? Well, I don't know. I guess it depends on the individual-- the relationship, whatnot. You know what an asthma attack feels like? It feels like you're trying to breathe air through a flattened straw. But if I take a hit of this, most times I'm okay. Like that. But my old man... in the end... he-- he had less than 5 % of his lung capacity. I mean, he... he went out hard! I'm sorry to hear that. If that starts happening to me with genetics and shit, I swear to God, it's silver bullet time. I'll do it myself. At least your wife, she went out fast, right? I'm telling you, man, you got to be grateful for that. So Sing Sing... you got through that? Whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger, right? Whatever don't... Whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger. Whatever don't kill you... I like that. All right. You're okay. - Joey, get this guy! - You're all right. Hey! What are you doing, huh? Come here. - Hey, man. Come on. - Bring him here! Junior, I'm drunk. I was drunk. I'm sorry. Which hand did you grab her with? Put it on the table, and I'm only going to say that once. Would you mind lighting one of those for me, please? - Thank you. - Junior. You think that's an easy job, dancing up there? It's hard what they do. - Are you kidding me? - Junior. Don't you move that fucking hand! When someone steps over the line, the difficult becomes the repulsively impossible. I think you should have more respect for what they put up with. So what can I do to make you remember and... appreciate what that's like being up there? Please. Come here. Come on. Come on. Get over here. Tonight, I'll tell you... you have really got this thing down to a science. Yeah? What thing? Well, look at them. Who would know? Am I right? Who would know what? No, I'm just-- I'm just saying, you know, admiring. Admiring? Yeah. Get him the fuck off there! I am so fucking stupid. I should have my fucking head examined. What is the matter with me? Hey! Hey! What are you fucking doing? What are you worrying about the guy for, huh? - What guy? - Huh?! What fucking guy? What do you want to know for? That's fucking great. I just did three years for you. Hey, hey, hey, hey! I did three years for you, you paranoid motherfucker. Okay, full-time, not a day less, for you, okay? What do you want to know about the guy for? J.J. pointed him out to me like two minutes before you sat down. If he's got a big fucking mouth, take it up with him. I was trying to make conversation. It's been a hard week. I'm sorry. I just lost control, you know? So... Want to go for a ride? Let's go for a ride. Come on. No problem. Know what an acronym is? It's like letters that stand for things-- you know, like FBI, TGIF. - You understand? - Yeah. I have an acronym for myself. You know what it is? B.A.D. B.A.D.-- balls, attitude, direction. You should give yourself an acronym. It helps you visualize your goals. How about F.A.B.? Fucked at birth. No good. Too negative. There's a bag in the trunk. Why don't you get it? Oh! Whoa... Omar. Don't you be fucking sneaking up on me like that. Shit, maybe you ought to lighten up on the yey-yo some. And you think I'm paranoid. - Who the fuck is this? - He's cool. He's my people. Your people, huh? Turn the fuck around, motherfucker. Omar, Omar, the cars. Yeah, man, you got the titles and shit? Always do. All right, I'll take them all except that Explorer. What's the matter with the Explorer? It's... it's red. - So I'll have them paint it. - No. No, man. No, it's still be red under the paint. Red's my bad-luck color. I ain't got nothin' to do with red. You're some funny people, my man. You got-- you got the 9s for me? Right here. Are you interested in MACs? I'll get you a dozen MACs by the weekend. MACs, yeah, man. I'll take MACs. - Yeah. - You got them. This motherfucker smells scared, Junior. I don't like that. You want to dance with me? 'Cause I love to dance. You hear what I'm saying? No more new fucking faces, all right? Whatever. How about you? You afraid of red? What am I, an interior decorator? I don't give a shit. Good. Explorer's yours. Jimmy. Over here. These are the cars we took. Where did they go? Terminator body parts? Got anything else? Yeah, there was a guy from the DMV there. - But I couldn't get his name. - Yeah, yeah, we're onto him. - So you hooked up with Junior? - Oh, yeah. Yeah? And how about Omar? Cut in Omar? Him, too. Bought everything on the sheet-- big bag of 9s, going for a dozen MACs over the weekend. All right. So I'll get that wire off you. I threw it away. - What? - I threw it away. I got patted down twice tonight. All right, so you're all right with them. - That will make it easier. - Easier for what? Easier to wear a fucking wire. Hmm. Let me ask you a question. Why you? You know, why did they put you on me? Revenge? You see this eye here? Runs all the time. I can't make it stop. I got a third of my hearing in this ear. And when I want to go to the beach, like, take my kids to the beach and play with them and shit, strong, direct sun gives me a migraine so bad, I cry like a baby. They don't know why. Just does. So I asked for you. And if you take that wire off one more time, I'm personally going to beat you to death. Maybe the next time you lay a hand on me, it won't be such a one-way beating. Hi. What do you got, a test? Are you going to get locked up again? No. - You would never do that to me. - No. 'Cause I'm not Bev. I can't live with that. She couldn't live with it, either. You got something you need to tell me? I'm under the rock. They got me wearing a wire. Oh. Funny thing is, I liked boosting cars, you know. There wasn't any make or model you couldn't pop the lock, kill the alarm, get it on the road in 90 seconds. And it felt good. It felt good to be good at something. I had money in my pocket, nice clothes, flash ride. Buy things for Bev, you know, take her places. It felt good. But it was bullshit. And when I finally got caught, going to jail, that's for real. D.A.'s office, Wednesday, 8:00 p.m. Mrs. Wang's restaurant. Wiring subject. Switch the ID plate with the junker's. Torch the junker. Cops will think it's the new car. Let's go. Wait. Ooh. I always get such a kick out of that. It's the kid in me. Mmm! - Hi. - Hey. Ugh! You smell like gasoline. He's a working man, babe. Give him a break. - I got to go. - Go where? Got to get home. She'll have my ass, so... Let's go. What's up? You don't know who to fucking trust these days, know what I mean? Junior, what? What's up? I do something? Walk over there and ask him if he wants a Rolls. Tell him it's red. Oh, come on, Junior. Don't make me do that. You come up on the passenger side. Hey. How you doing? What the fuck you all want, man? Oh, my God. Oh, my God! You killed him. Have some coke, on me. Jesus! Jesus! What did you do? What did you do? What the fuck did you do? What did I do? You fuck with the bull, you get the horns. That's what I did. Come up with a more positive acronym for yourself yet? A what? You know what I hate more than anything? I hate the taste of metal in my mouth. Silverware makes me gag. I got to use plastic forks and spoons all the time. You know, I, uh... I never told anybody about me and the metal tasting before. Tomorrow, fuck the cars. Just come by the bar. I want you to-- we... we should have a conversation about life and shit. Yeah, get me Calvin Hart. I didn't do nothing. I'd like to blow your fucking head off. You know that? I didn't do it! I am not going to talk to you! Just keep your fucking mouth shut, all right? I want to know why the fuck you didn't you tell us Omar was a federal agent?! He was a what? We couldn't compromise our investigation. He was a what?! Your investigation? It's called common courtesy. It's called professionalism. You arrogant prick! What a fucking waste of time! What are you talking about? Our man was killed. And your confidential informant's a witness. Well, maybe your man would still be alive if you bothered let us in on it. Yeah, it's your own damn fault. Calm down. Let's go. Relax, everybody relax. Your C.I. is ours. The fuck he is! Oh, yeah? Then I'm charging him with homicide. Fuck you! You're not doing shit, Hanratty. 'Cause I'll go to the U.S. Attorney's office, and believe me, once they find out that the guy you're trying to indict is a state-run C.I. that you knew about from day one, holy shit, what happens to you! Do you ever read about yourself in the paper, huh? Your balls shrivel to the size of chickpeas. So what do you want? Stop. Talk to me. I'm right here. Shut up. I want in. I want a joint prosecution-- state and federal. And I want this pursued in state court. - Federal. - State! Federal's what I'll give you. Federal's what you'll get. - State court! - Federal, I'll give you federal. I am right here. Talk to me. What the fuck you all want, man? Oh, my God. Oh, my God! You killed him. Have some coke, on me. Jesus! Jesus! What did you do? What did you do? What the fuck did you do? You fuck with the bull, you get the horns. That's what I did. You finished with me now? You've got to be dreaming. - Let's go. - Let's do it. You want to get some of them flaming torches? You're under arrest, motherfucker. State or federal? - Both. - Oh! Come on, scumbag. Hey, hey! You got nothing. I want to go to the beach. We have to wait, sweetheart. - I forgot Buttercup. - Shh, honey. We'll get him. Can I take her on the beach at least? Jimmy, I'm telling you, there ain't gonna be no trial. I don't think that's a good idea. - They're going to cop a plea. - Cop a plea? He killed a Fed. He didn't know John was a Fed, okay? He can't chance a trial. I don't like this cereal. We're gonna do everything within our power to keep you off the stand. You really think I'm that stupid? Fellas, am I telling it the way it is, or what? You're a fucking maniac, you know that? So where are they hiding him? Atlantic City? How many times you going to move us? We can't stay in one place too long. It's not smart. Can't you even play with her a little? Goddamn you. You hanging on, honey? Juicy, hang on. Hang on. Whoo. There you go. Hang on. Whoo. Hey-ya, sweetie. Lookie here what I got. Your wife's final exams. Think we need to monitor her for cheating? She cannot take any damn exams, Calvin. We're all going fucking nuts. I'm losing my mind. Ready, honey? Here we go. Look... I got to go into the city tonight. My youngest daughter Coral... Maybe tomorrow when I come back, I can bring her with me. You know, they're about the same age and all... her and Corinna. That would be really good of you, man. Hey. Hey. Ready? Here we go. Whoa. A space ride. My guy was in fear of his life and he fired in self-defense. Dover's gun was still holstered when they pulled him out of the car. My guy claims that Agent Dover-- Omar-- made a move for it without provocation. I can produce witnesses who will testify that Agent Dover had drawn that gun on my client at least three times in the past, who can testify that they had seen Agent Dover taking cocaine repeatedly, and that his behavior in the last few months was increasingly bizarre and paranoid. Mafia shrinks-- the autopsy came up negative on drugs. - You find anything in the car? - No. No, huh? I want to know if Agent Dover had assassination clearance. - Had what? - All right, let me rephrase. Had clearance to shoot first if he perceived that his cover had been blown. You going fishing here, Jack? Not at all. I want to find out if we got a drug-taking federal agent strung out, walking around with shoot-first clearance. Because, in all due respect, if that's what we got here-- What a bunch of slanderous horse shit! - Excuse me. - Can I help you ladies? I'm looking for a hotel called Tesselers. Tesselers? I'm sorry. You got me. It's near Allenville? Allenville? Well, you just drove through Allenville. Why don't you backtrack and ask someone there? Okay. Thank you. You're welcome. Corinna? Corinna? This is number three to base. I don't have Corinna. I want an inventory of all guns, drugs, and cars acquired in New York. I want to know how they were disposed of in Philadelphia. Was this stuff being put back into the community to establish Dover's street credibility? I want to know how many other agents were involved? Judge, this is an ongoing operation. He's asking us to jeopardize agents still in the field. Well, I don't see how I can demonstrate self-defense if I can't show the pressures on the guy and if I can't find out if he had shoot-first clearance? Okay. Why don't you bring me all the files? I'll read them in chambers, try to sort out what's privileged and what's appropriate for discovery. I can't do that, Judge. What do you mean you can't do that? I'm ordering it produced. Either you produce the files, or I dismiss the indictment. Corinna! Corinna! - Corinna! - Corinna! Corinna! Corinna! Corinna! Co-- Corinna! Corinna! I want to be with my mommy. What did... Honey. You guys really weren't putting guns back on the street just for credibility, were you? I mean, that was just an educated guess on my part. And if you try to indict him on anything else, I am still gonna want to know where the goodies went. And you can tell the state prosecutor the same thing. You're dropping it? I don't believe this shit. Well, hell. All right. I guess it's up to me. You can't be serious. Why? Because you don't want to jeopardize national security? Huh? Come on. Whose chain do you think you're yanking here? If you guys have been doing shit you shouldn't have been doing, hey, you know... that's your problem. We're not giving up any files on the task force. Oh, yeah? Well... we'll see about that. Come here. What do you want? What do I want? I want a judgeship. Federal. Yeah! So where do they got Kilmartin? Witness protection? No. I hear he's still on the street. No shit. Live free or die, huh? Okay. You go to Grandma. I got you. I got you. - You'll be safe. - Okay. I'll talk to you later. Talk to you later, too. Call Calvin at least. Why? It's going to be okay. Bye-bye. Where you going, Daddy? - Love you. - Okay. Hey, hey, it's me-- Calvin. Come on. Give me the gun. Turn it loose. Give me the gun. Politics? What does that mean? What does that mean? Jimmy, look-- Why are you here? Why are you here? What do you come to my house for? To tell me I got the shaft? To take my gun away from me? Mmm. Yeah. People come to me, say, "Jimmy, we need your help. Please help us." And I do, but whatever I do, I end up getting fucked. My family... hanging by a thread. But it's not going to happen. They're not going down. Give me something, Calvin. Calvin, give me something, please. Please. Help me. You want to get a dog? Yeah. Give me two hot dogs. I thought you said you were a man of honor. Shouldn't you be in witness protection? What's Junior Brown doing on the street? He killed a federal agent. Shit happens. I don't understand. You had the murder tape. You had me. Come here. What tape? And who the fuck are you? You know what the worst part about this job is? Every day, you got to deal with one lowlife C.I. after another. It's enough to make you sick. Well, I guess you won't have to bother with that anymore, huh, Judge? Where'd you hear that? Let Junior Brown walk, win yourself a federal judgeship. Well, at least you don't come cheap. You know... the Junior Browns of the world will always be with us. What's one Junior Brown more or less compared to the work that I can do as a federal judge? I'm a good goddamn prosecutor, but I will make a great judge. Let's see what happens when I go to the papers, Your Honor. With what? "Fuck with the bull, you get the horns"? Come on, what is he, a matador? Besides, the last I heard, that tape got ate by the garbage monster. Jimmy? You got a phone call. - Hello? - How long does it take you to get from Mrs. Wangs to Baby Cakes? - Why the fuck are you there? - How long? I don't know. 20 minutes. - 20 minutes. Don't be late. - Jimmy! Shit. Hey! Ooh! Hey, Junior. - What's shaking? - What are you doing here? I was going to ask you the same thing. You killed a Fed. How the hell did you walk on that? Shit happens. You blew his brains all over me. His people know that. How did they even let you live? Shit happens. Shit happens. Well, I guess so. Did you tell the cops how metal in my mouth makes me gag? Because it was a funny thing. I couldn't get plastic forks in jail. I had to eat everything with my fingers. What the hell... How did you swing it, Junior? I'm dying to know. Now is not the time, my man, but I'm going to see you real soon. Let's go. Easy. Easy. Get over there. Over there. See me now. Jimmy, answer me this. Who do I visit first? You at your house or your wife and kid up at the Grandma's? You don't like the taste of metal in your mouth, huh? Open up. Come on, Junior. Say, "Ahh." You saw what I did to Omar. Guess who's next. No! Don't touch him! You know this don't end with you, right? I'm going to... I'm going to take your baby girl for a little walk in the woods. Get the motherfucker! Oh! Ha! Ah! Hold on! Whoa! Now you did it. Don't you know you can't go around hitting the police? Huh? What's wrong with you? Oh... Come on. Get up. Get up. Don't move, huh? - What do we got? - Assaulting an officer. - You okay, man? - Nobody can touch me! Nobody. Jesus, I'm sorry. You got anything you want to explain to me, you suicidal son of a bitch? - Fuck. - I ain't suicidal. With this tape, you can drop Junior down the hole for 30 years. You still got to get Zioli to prosecute. You saw what I did to Omar. Guess who's next. So what? What did he do to Omar? He didn't specify. You don't like that tape? Well... How about this one? They would love it on TV. What's one Junior Brown more or less compared to the work that I can do as a federal judge? I'm a good goddamn prosecutor, but I will make a great judge. You like that one better? I re-indict Junior, you got to take the stand. You got to start that rollercoaster over again. Nah, I think I'm gonna get lost. My family's health is in your best interest. So you better do a good job. Listen to the part where he says, "You saw what I did to Omar." Listen to that again. It's probably better than you think. Kilmartin, wait. Jimmy. Jimmy! Don't do this to me! Daddy, come on! Let's go! Captioned by Post Haste Digital
