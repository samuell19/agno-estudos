1940. WWII is underway. The Soviet Union seizes Lithuania and conducts massive deportations of Lithuanians to Siberia. One year later the country is occupied by Hitler's Germany. The Nazis wipe out virtually the entire population of Lithuanian Jews. Influenced by Nazi propaganda, several thousand Lithuanians take part in these massacres. With the end of WWII, having retaken the country, the Soviets launch investigations into the perpetrators of war crimes. Despite this, the deportations of innocent people continues, regardless of ethnicity. Move. Move, I said. Come on! Go, go! Pick it up! Do you think you're on holidays or something? What are you staring at? On your knees. Kiss my shoe! Schweine! Kiss it! Shove off you piece of shit! Keep moving! Faster! What the fuck you stupid asshole? Juden raus! Juden raus! Run for it! Schnell! Where are you going? Out of my way! Step back! - That Jew, Isaac. - What? I was in prison... He reported on me to Russians. What Isaac? Isaac... I was in prison... Go away! Get closer! Do you hear me? Don't you stare at me! Don't! On your knees! You filthy Jew! You filthy Jews! - Come with me. - I'm not a Jew... Don't touch him! Go away! Papers! Faster. Schnell, schnell, come on! Alles gut, Kapit√§n. Lithuanian, Andrius Gluosnis. Get lost! Halt! Your Jew? Get your revenge then! Did you shit your pants? Got no balls or what? Kill him! Give him to me! Drag that Jew here!

Let's go see the sailors. That's him! That's him for sure! Hello, my dears! Hello, hello. All of Soviet Lithuania was waiting for you, Comrade Gutauskas. Thank you, thank you. Thank you, my dears. Hello, Gediminas! - Welcome back! - Thank you. - We are glad to see you. - Thank you so much. - Welcome back. I'm Antanas. - Nice to meet you. - Comrade Gutauskas... - I'm Gediminas. - Give them to me. - Thank you. - Hello! - Good to see you. Thank you, thank you. - We're always prepared. - Thank you. - I'm very pleased. - Have some Lithuanian rye bread. And something more. Excuse me, comrade Gutauskas, maybe we could have a word? Talk to you later. My dears, cheers. Please accept this wreath from the people of Soviet Lithuania. Thank you, thank you. - Can we take a group picture? - Yes, of course. OK, girls, get closer. Okay, move aside. Smile! (Russian) You have to understand that security is our priority. (Russian) What's with his arms? (Russian) What's wrong with them? (Russian) Why are they tied up? (Russian) Well, you have to understand, all sorts of things happen in this place. (Russian) Our investigation will show what's going on here... (Russian) I totally agree. (Russian) We better go to my office to talk. (Russian) Look, how quick they are over fulfilling five - year plan for corpses. On the 17th of May, Gediminas Gutauskas, a communist writer and director, has returned from the United States to Soviet Lithuania. The Western world with its revanchist views is inciting hysteria about another war, despising art and culture. Gutauskas is not afraid to speak up about the hardships of immigration... Hello, Comrade Gutauskas, and welcome back to Soviet Lithuania. How was your trip, not too boring? Thank you, all was good. After the flight of Darius and Girenas nothing can scare me. How long did it take you to get back to Soviet Lithuania? I can barely believe it myself. 21 years! What were your motives to stay in the U.S. for such a long time and now to come back all of the sudden? The longing. Hi. Hi. I felt it every day. Gedas is back. I know. Did you meet him? No. Why don't we meet then? What did you say? I said, maybe let's meet? What do you mean? Us? With Gedas? Maybe invite him to come over? We could have met him. With flowers... Like a hero. With some bread and salt. To feed him. Eat, Elena, eat... To offer him a drink. We could celebrate, all three of us. Elena... Elena, open the door. Open the door. I'm sorry. Elena, I'm so sorry. Elena... I'm going to my mother's. Good afternoon. Is that you? Elena? Elena! How come you're here? Why didn't you come upstairs? I didn't want to disturb you. I just wanted to say hello. - Hi. - Hi. - Hello. - Hello. Listen, I'd like to... invite you for a coffee or something, but I'm in a hurry. - Do you need a lift? - I don't want to bother you. Come on, get in. Get in. Let's chat for a few moments. And where's Andrius? I'll send him an invitation and maybe he'll come over. I doubt it. Well, maybe. Why not? Oh well, he was always like that... He's still angry about what happened so many years ago? Well, that's nonsense... So, how's the film? Actually, I'm on my way to meet the actors. Some I picked myself, some were suggested to me. I gave them my script to read, to see if they've understood anything. That's so quick. When are you starting to shoot? I've no idea. The sooner the better. I'm so excited to start. I want... Everything has changed so much here. I have this feeling that... But you also work for the studio, don't you? I saw your name on the list. What do you do? Sit behind the desk, do the accounts... Not bad, not bad. It's bad, Gedas, very bad. I'm so bored. Maybe that's why I came to talk to you. Listen... Could I work with you? I could be your assistant. Whatever, I could do anything. If you could ask for me in the studio, I'd just help you. If you let me, Gedas. I'll start from the most... from the most important event. I don't know if... The year 1941, Lietukis garage massacre. Let's try to maintain the observer's perspective... so that there is some self-identification right up to the act itself, right to the murder. The camera is the observer. - I'm the observer. - In short, we need a situation... involving a young man's... revenge. Reasonable revenge, based on his emotion, disregarding any ethnicity. He is using that revenge... Though we see it only afterwards... It's a small man's desire to establish himself, the problem of our small country. And it's revealed at the full in that garage. You are a small person. (Russian) - How's it going? All good? (Russian) - Everything's fine. (Russian) Get something to eat. I'll replace you. ...the death of the other person or what happens to you afterwards. Let's have a drink. I haven't even noticed. I want to show you one more thing. That's a good one. Can we take copies of the script? Sure, I have them all here. Good. (Russian) Comrade Gutauskas. (Russian) - You have a call. (Russian) - Okay. (Russian) Keep the change. Excuse me! Vincas? Bring it here! The star has come! Vincas, come here! Thank you. Nice to hear it. Come here. Andrius Gluosnis! Gedas... - It's been twenty years! - Hi. Your face hasn't changed since the last time I saw you. And you're the same swine who crossed the Atlantic twenty years ago. Swine, swine. A swine with a tie! So, what can I get you to drink? Oh, I don't know. Champagne! Let's go somewhere... Oh, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry... - It's nothing. - I am terribly sorry... I should be sorry. - We're sorry. - You are forgiven. - Forgive me. - No worries. Just think about it. And it's not even the first time! A way to get a role! As old as the Earth! She's good looking though. You noticed? Gedas... Listen, we start shooting soon. I've been received so nicely. I didn't know everything would happen so quickly. You should have seen how they greeted me. Everybody is trying to stroke my ego. I'm inflating like a balloon. How is... How is Elena? She's fine. She wanted to see you but couldn't come. Her mother got sick. She went to visit her. I'll need her help on the set. OK. Gedas, do you have a phone? Can I make a short call? Yes, it's just around the corner, on your right. - In the kitchen. - OK, good. I'll be quick. Come to the sitting room afterwards. There'll be a brief presentation of my work. Definitely. And yes, Andrius, no bad intentions. I'm serious. Here's to lost time. Give it to me, mom. Sit down, okay? Comrade writer and director Gutauskas's short story, which gave birth to this film script. The film, hopefully, will also be delivered soon. For sure! It all depends on how long our party will last. - Listen, come here. - Director onto the stage! Give it up to the director! Listen! You placed your head on the sacrificial altar and I killed you. You spilled the tea leaves and I killed you. Why do I have to carry this cursed burden? Isaac, where are you? I'm losing my mind. Isaac, where are you? I'm not losing my mind. I've lost it long ago and buried in my mother's womb. What if Isaac is still alive? What if he's alive forever and we've both been moved to the next circle of hell? Bravo! I don't know him. - I've only worked with him once. - I saw him for the first time. Come here for a moment. I have to go. Where's my wine? Where have you been? Just like in good old days? Like swine! Why did you come back, Gedas? Hey you, Lithuanian, what's up? What happened? Come over, c'mon. Well? Look at me and say... say that you didn't miss me? I didn't miss you. Like hell you didn't. You ran away and left me here alone to rot. Now you're back because... you're exploding with love for me? Don't fuck with me, Gedas. Tell me why you came back. You could have left too, if you wanted. I escaped. You stayed. Back then it was every man for himself. Remember that. You stayed so you could be with her. - You stayed with her. - That's enough. So that's why you came back? Not for this! No! Not for this. I was happy back there. I just feel that I can... that I have something to say to all these people. I want to be the one who came back, you understand? I feel they have been waiting for my return. That's all. That's just an illusion, Gedas. Illusion? The thing I'm talking about? I'm talking about the essence here. About my film. That script, Gedas, where did you dig it up? From here... and from here. But... you weren't here. You ran away. I ran off, my feet were running, but not my head. I experienced the same thing you did. Nobody cares what's in your head. People continue to live their lives. They've forgotten it all. Exactly! Everyone forgot everything. Everyone! Everyone forgot everything... Even more in America than here. I see people's faces... eye's with nothing in... (Russian) Number three, number three, I hear static. (Russian) - I'm fixing it now. (Russian) - Got it. I want to remind them what the real world was. - Nobody needs those memories, Gedas. - Everyone's memories are needed... These people have suffered enough. You are what your memories are! Without your memories, you cease to exist. Hold on! Bodies will be different in another world, maybe with no genitals, maybe with wings. What kind of fluids will we use to clean our feathers? What threads will we use to mend the holes? Or maybe only holes will remain? Dressed in thin skin, like after the bombing of Hiroshima. There will be no need to shave! We'll communicate using our inner eyes. - OK, enough... - Hold on! Last patches of light are the limit and the night lies beyond them. You can reach it by boat or by plane, but I'm not in there, you understand? We are not in there! That was the word of the Lord! - Watermelon, anyone? - I want it. Director, please don't leave us, we are all blind. Just recently, film director Gediminas Gutauskas returned to Soviet Lithuania. My team did a preventive research and discovered that a film will be made with a script accurately recreating the massacre at the Lietukis garage. The script tells the story of Aleksas Skaidra, one of the local Nazi collaborators, who brutally kills a Jew Isaac Kaplan. Judging from the photos of the investigation held in 1944, lsaac Kaplan appears to be a real person, while there is no mention of Aleksas Skaidra. So my team is trying to figure out if he was an actual person or a fictional character. And... all the information is here. The script, photos, and case files. I propose to reopen the case of 1944 which was closed due to the lack of evidence. On June 27, 1941, a squad of German soldiers, aided by local collaborators, the so-called white armbands, brutally murdered 40 Jews, suspected of being Bolsheviks. Several days ago, we received photos from the German archive that prove the authenticity of this incident. Hi. Hello? Yes. Alright. Right away. (Russian) How are the hypoglossal canal and laryngeal cartilages? (Russian) Multiple fractures. (Russian) Amateurs? (Russian) That is for you to determine. (Russian) Hello. (Russian) Hey, Romka, what do we have here? (Russian) Good evening, comrades. (Russian) - Hello. (Russian) - Hello. (Russian) - Hello. (Russian) - Hello, Comrade Major. (Russian) Why are you here? (Russian) He's one of ours. (Russian) What do you mean? (Russian) He was mentally ill. (Russian) I'll take the photos. (Russian) All right. (Russian) The negatives as well. (Russian) The negatives are at home. (Russian) Not a problem. We'll send someone. (Russian) Put everything in order here. Do you hear me? (Russian) ls that clear? As always... you work your fingers to the bone, and the Soviets take it all. Be careful what you say. You owe me. OK, see you. What did he do? Well, he enjoyed the radio too much. Turn around! Turn around! Listen to him, you Jew. Thank you. This won't happen again. I'm very sorry. The armband needs to be tightened up. Listen, can you say... one more thing before killing? Say, "I will kill you". - All right. - Shout it. All right. - Just like... - Turn around! Turn around... I... l will kill you! No. l don't know. Wrong intonation, but... Gedas, sorry, I just want to adjust the lighting. I'll create some more tension. There's too much... How much time do you need? Well, ten, twelve, fifteen minutes maximum. - You have ten. - No problem. OK, let's have 10 minute break. It's much better now. I don't know. I don't believe it, understand? I don't think there should be a line. No words are needed. There should be a cry from the inside. An indescribable, terrifying sound. A beastly scream of a murderer, you understand? Then maybe he shouldn't speak at all. That's precisely what I'm saying. There's a lack of emotion. We need emotion. Not fear, but... some inner desperation, something beastly, I don't know. - Talk to him. - Excuse me. (Russian) Hello, Comrade Gediminas. (Russian) Do you prefer Lithuanian or Russian? Lithuanian. Major Kazimieras Petkevicius. Get in the car, please. I'd like to have a friendly chat. Now? Yes. Maybe after the shoot? Why now? Not after. Now. We won't take long. Gedas, what should we do? What do you want me to tell the team? Tell them he's having stomach issues. Listen, you go ahead and start shooting. I'll... I'll join you later. When? I'll find out what this is all about, and... Attention everyone, 5 minute break and then back to work. What's this all about? I want to talk to you about the... the film you're working on. Please, take a seat. Yes, so? How's the shoot going? Not bad. How far along are you? - We've just started. - Just started? Nice tie. - Yours isn't bad either. - Well, mine doesn't show. Yes. Did you write the script? Yes. Thank you. It's a very good script. I've read many scripts, but this one left... - Well, thanks. - A great impression... Thanks. Is it based on the events at the Lietukis garage? Yes. I'm just curious... because your description is very accurate. What were you doing in the summer of 1941? Wait a minute, are you... Where are you going with this? Where am I going? No. You've misunderstood me. - What are you trying to say? - I just wanted to ask... Your description is so accurate. I was wondering if you by any chance participated... No, no. By no chance. There are many eyewitness accounts, many people... A lot has been written. That was the time... Oh, yes. Listen, l can give you the script to read. I have it. You won't believe it, but I have the script. Here. I have it. I've read it many times. Great work. Did you write it alone? All by yourself? Listen, are you accusing me of something? Actually, can you remember what you were doing that summer? June, the garage... Are you mocking me? I don't understand. Why are you mocking me? Well, no, I'm not mocking you. Then what are you doing? Why do I have to sit on this chair? Well, because... There is nowhere else to sit. Then what am I doing here? If I'm not under arrest, can I leave? Of course. Just like that? Now? I can just go? If you wish. Well, goodbye then. Goodbye. Get lost. Photographer! Just a second. Thanks. Pour me a beer, please. The action takes place in certain circumstances, the circumstances we're all in. I'm not going to deny the importance of these circumstances. They affect us all. - I understand that. - And we're all connected. I understand that, but where is the conflict? - There's no need for the conflict. - Hi, what are you celebrating? We're celebrating the return of director Gediminas Gutauskas. Another one? What's the matter with you? Spent too much time in the morgue? I'm tired. I heard that you know Gediminas. We were classmates. Well, not exactly classmates but we went to the same school. - Youth friends, then? - Not really... We were just friends, and then he... ...he's just molding statues of Lenin. Then he became a great director. And what is the director up to now? Experimenting with something. Not making a film? I mean, you'd know better. - His statues of Lenin? - I'm trying not to think about it. (Russian) What did you say about Lenin? Excuse me? (Russian) What did you say about Lenin? - Me? - He says we're talking about Lenin. It's nothing, just a slip of a tongue. "Oh, Lenin!" (Russian) Okay, let's take them. (Russian) Let's get to work. (Russian) You go out yourself or... For a friendly chat, right? Got that? You're telling me to become friends with your pal Gediminas? No. I don't know. Guys, maybe it's enough? - I should go home. - Wait, stay a bit. - My wife is waiting for me. - She'll wait. Stay. "The drowning man". (Russian) Cheers. I'm not feeling myself anymore. I keep thinking, "who am I?" Who are we? Who are you? I want easiness. I want to laugh. I want to laugh... I can't laugh with you anymore. (Russian) Oleg, why was he alone? (Russian) I don't know. I was given a different assignment. (Russian) What assignment? On whose orders? (Russian) Mironov. (Russian) Mironov. What assignment? (Russian) To work on object number five. (Russian) But that doesn't mean you don't have to inform me. (Russian) Am I being clear? (Russian) Yes, sir. Gluosnis, you aren't needed here. False alarm. It's our internal affair. What's going on? Our agent. I don't know who leaked the information, but it's likely related to the return of your friend Gutauskas. It all began with him. After reading the script, we reopened the case. Yevgeny was supposed to investigate the case and follow any leads connected with that event. It was the Lietukis Garage execution. Summer of 1941. Know anything about it? A bit. General facts. We received some new pictures from the German archives. We hadn't seen them before. I want you to check if they are authentic. OK? Here they are. - Do you have the negatives? - Yes. This is between the two of us. - Got it? - Yes. - Let me know. - Absolutely. - Do it slower. - OK. Let's try. I don't know what to do with her. She refuses to undress. I can't force her. We have enough females, let's shoot. No. Not enough for me. Why do you say we have enough? I refuse to film. What, are we going to film a dressed-up horse? Why can't you? I'm sorry, l just can't. I'm a decent girl. What if my parents see me... What's indecent in this? It's a historical film. Set in 1941. We're filming history. Is history indecent? Don't yell. It's indecent, because... - I'm so sorry... - Your grandfather might be lying here. I told you that's how things would go with her. - OK, we're done. - I don't know. - What do you mean we're done? - We're done. I can't work like this. I can't film just anything. - Don't film just anything. Film me. - I've had enough of this. Compromising at every step. Look, I'm also tired. I want to finish and be done. Let's do it. Let's just do this. What are you doing? What am I doing? Someone has to do it. - What are you doing? - Ready? Action. - Play the music! - Mikas, can we start? We're ready. We've been waiting. Let's roll. Sound? Good. T 38-18... Lower. Good. Action. - I'm ready. - Action! It needs to be underscored that the final ending, or non-final lack of an ending, depends on you. We believe that independent decisions and free will... are inside us from the beginning. Whether a man is... a genius, an idiot, a child or an old man already insane... - Stop! - Free will... Lifeless? Yes? We've seen that hundred times. OK. One more take. But he is very specific. He sees all the details, this ground, everything, but he's an aristocrat. He doesn't hesitate to say everything that he... He's a giant of mind.. - Let's try again. - While his other hand... I shouldn't look? Try not to look... Are we doing this or not? Let's do it. - What is it? - Nothing. Are you mad at me? What? That I... Aren't you angry that I... that I ran away? Perhaps something could've happened? Maybe. - Don't be so full of yourself. - Maybe it would be different. Always trying to win over the audience, not a woman. Now you have your audience. You knew that you end up with him. l did and said everything I could. He just sat and did nothing. In silence... The way you looked at him. You were always his. Why do you talk to me as if I'm an object? Like it's just the three of us in the world. Just you, me, and him. Someone belongs to someone. Someone is meant for someone. He is mine, I am his, you are not mine. I remember clearly why I stayed with Andrius. With him alone and no one else. Do you know why? I found his mysteriousness attractive. It seemed that he understood, felt and knew everything, that there was something profound inside him, something noble and unmovable. Do you understand? I never noticed any vanity in him, ever. He had absolutely different concerns in life. Gedas, absolutely different. I always wanted him to open up. I thought that when it happens, I'll see his heart and understand everything. I wanted to unlock him. But I'm fed up with that silence. I'm so tired. I don't want it anymore. It feels so good that now you listen to me, you look at me and you see me. You see me, right? You hear me? It feels good. What was that? Hello? l was looking for you. Where did you go? With Gedas? When will you be back? Elena... what's going on? You... You want... Are you happy with him? Tell me. Answer me. Answer me. Do you know why people are silent? They're like oyster shells... afraid to open up and expose their pearl. And God forbid if there's nothing inside. Let's go to my place. I have some cognac. No, thanks. I can't. I'll sleep at my mother's. Good night. Good night. A cognac, please. Mother? Mother! Mother! Mother! (Russian) Pull over. Would you like to kill him? No. Why? He arouses fear in you. Wouldn't you like to get rid of it? Get rid of the fear? No. Fear is the only feeling I have. If I lose it, I'd have nothing left. I'll lose my name, myself. Aleksas Skaidra... is a man who fears. Do you understand this? Without my fear I'd be nothing. I cherish it. When fear invaded my life, I thought I was done. I was wrong. It was just the beginning. I became someone. I gained something, a face. Understand me, I love and that's special. I love my fear. I love Isaac because he's the only one who'll never leave me. - Do you understand? - I do. Doctor, he'll never leave me. - I understand. (Russian) - You can't go in there! - He's the only person who... - Where are you going? Please continue. Good evening. But do you know what fear is? - Vincas, Vincas... - Stop. What's going on? Nothing. Just checking on things. You are Isaac? - Skaidra. - Alright. OK. Let's all go into the other room. All right? (Russian) Everybody, let's go. All of us? Shall we? We've received an order to shut down your film until further notice. Comrade Gutauskas has been summoned for questioning. The footage is confiscated. Oleg will help you to clean up. Oleg? (Russian) Hurry up. Gentlemen, thank you and good night. (Russian) Everyone, gather your belongings. What kind of decision is this? Decision? It's not a decision. It's over. Wait a minute. I haven't spoken yet. Stop. - It clearly is a stop. - Gedas, calm down. We'll call the director of the studio. (Russian) Pack your things and leave. No one is going anywhere. Put the table down. The body that is sown is perishable, it is raised imperishable; it is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power; So it is written: The first man Adam became a living being; the last Adam, a life-giving spirit. The spiritual did not come first, but the natural, and after that the spiritual. Make a hole here. Take it all out. I don't need anything. Gedas, why did you come back? Not to steal wives. There's nothing going on between us. She loves you. And is waiting for you to express your love for her. You... Brother, if you can't express it, there's nothing. You came back to teach us how to express ourselves? To change our lives? I came home. Home? My home is here. Here? Here is your home? Where are you going? This is my home! I borrowed money to buy these clothes. Imagine that. Bought booze to get others drunk, like a real artist. Look at this! Wonderful, isn't it? I bought an incredibly... expensive typewriter, placed it on the antique oak desk, sat on the chair, lit up a cigar and leaned over. I froze in that pose for twenty years over a blank page. Gedas, you've flushed twenty years down the toilet. I gave birth to dead babies. They needed to be buried right away. Their hearts weren't beating. You know that Antanas is dead? Antanas who? Antanas Skema, your good buddy. Who was supposed to come back here but went up there instead. Did you know that during our last meeting he brought me his novel and said, "Gedutis, if you don't... if you don't take care of it, no one will." You know? Do you know the name of his novel? Isaac. Did Antanas write it? Yes. And you stole it? I had to come back with something. - Gedas, you are a thief. - I had to have something. - You are a thief. - I had to bring something with me. I couldn't return empty-handed. You stole it. After so many years, at least a scrap of a good script. I had to... I had to please the system somehow. I had no idea that it would turn out this way. Where did he get that story? Did he take part in it? Who told him about it? Never mind. Isaac lost a lot of blood... but he's still alive. Isaac... Isaac is alive. As long as I'm alive so is him. Elena... - Hi. - Hi. I rushed over to see you. I don't live here anymore. - You don't? - No. I... I just wanted to talk to you. I know that... I can't change anything. I'm not a magician. I can't reverse time and bring you back to the days... when you and me... when we loved each other. No, you can't. We were happy. Elena... I know that you've waited for so long... Major. Colonel. A few words. Please. - How is the Garage case going? - Very well. The film was confiscated and the director got an ultimatum. Good. I've read the report. Gutauskas is neutralized. Congratulations. Case is closed. Why is the case closed? There is nothing else left to discover. No trustworthy witnesses, no real clues. Only one suspect and nothing to charge him with. Listen, Gutauskas will talk. I just need some time. Too many coincidences. He was there for sure. All details of the script match, the time when he was there, the facts, the date of the killings. I'll make him talk. I just need a little... Why are you so obsessed with Gutauskas? He's an artist. It's all loose talk. We don't have anything to charge him with. You can't close this case. It's gone too far. I've been working hard on this case, I don't sleep, I don't eat, I don't leave the building. I'm convinced that it's a high-level conspiracy. Gutauskas is just the tip of the iceberg. If we make him talk, we'll find out everything. Zhenya had to follow Gutauskas. Look what happened. - Do you think it's a coincidence? - This isn't a debate. It's an order. Zhenya is buried. Forget him. Forget Gutauskas. He'll never admit to anything. Those are Mironov's orders. He'll confess, Colonel. I just need time. I beg you, please. It's over, Kazimieras. Relax. Have a rest. And don't rush like that. (Russian) Good morning, Comrade Gutauskas. (Russian) Get up and let's go. We need to talk. (Russian) Hurry up. Don't forget your shoes. (Russian) Shoes... Shoes. Got it. (Russian) And your jacket. And my key? Did I take it last night? (Russian) Let's go. Hurry up. Good morning, Comrade Kazimieras. Am I supposed to hide my hands under my legs today? (Russian) Get up. Hurry up. (Russian) Sit down. 1941, June 27. Lietukis Garage. Names. I wasn't anywhere near, I... Do you know that we have witnesses who saw you there? You want me to read it? Should I read it? Do you know Povilas Sapolas? No. Don't know him? Yet he knows you very well. You went to the same gymnasium. Listen. 1941, June 27. My brother, Jonas Sapolas, and I were walking along Vytautas Blvd. on our way to the grocer's. Suddenly we heard some noise in the yard of the Lietukis Garage. We saw a group of Nazi collaborators and sympathizers torturing Jews: hosing them with water, dragging through manure, and so on. Interrogator: Did you recognize anyone? Answer: Yes, I saw some boys from the gymnasium. Vytenis Pociunas, Jurgis Tamasaitis and Gediminas, I don't remember his last name. We were unable to watch this humiliation and left quickly. Nonsense. I wasn't there. I wasn't there! In what political organization you were before, during and after the war? None, I have no interest in any political organization and I've never had any. Well, it's obvious. You have no interest in anything but yourself. You must know that people of your sort don't last here? (Russian) Wash your face. (Russian) Stay still. (Russian) You fuck. (Russian) Stay still. Hello? Hello? Hello? Elena? Gedas? Gedas. Gedas... Hello? Gedas. Gedas. Wake up. Gedas, wake up. Gedas! Fuck it! Gedas! I've already seen these pictures. You've shown me. I know. Show me where are you in these pictures? I'm not there. I'm not in the frame. Here is Isaac. Isaac Kaplan. My neighbour. On the 2nd of June, I was at home. Through my window l could see the soldiers, and Isaac was with them. OK, l saw that. He pointed at my window, they were talking about something. I couldn't hear what it was about. But on June 3, the following day, they arrested me and put me in prison. I was accused of being a member of the Lithuanian Activist Assoc... Lithuanian Activist Front. Yes, I was accused. Were there any grounds for that accusation? ...of participating and promoting anti-Soviet activity... - Were there any grounds? - No. OK, keep going. They held me... Louder. They held me there for about two weeks. They used all kinds of measures to extract information from me. What measures? All kinds. He couldn't have betrayed you. Why? I'll read it to you. 1941, June 4. Isaac Kaplan is arrested for refusing to hand over his shop to Soviet authorities and not providing the necessary information about the Lithuanian Activist Front, its meeting places and hideouts. Decision: Seize Isaac Kaplan's property and incarcerate him. It looks like you two were in the same prison, Gluosnis. It won't hurt. White, brown? Doesn't matter. I'm about to start one more investigation. This one is on us, the insiders. Gluosnis was our man, I don't know how many others were involved in it. Could you get Mironov's permission to investigate our staff? To find out, if anyone took part in the collaboration with Nazis. I need Mironov's permit to perform this investigation. I am determined to investigate everyone personally. All right, Kazimieras. To you. I'll call Mironov, but don't mention this to anybody. Of course. Let this stay between us. Let me know Mironov's answer as soon as possible. Thank you. (Russian) Oleg, come here for a minute. Then Isaac collapsed. I felt nauseous. Over there, when they opened the door, there was a dog barking loudly. There were bodies everywhere. I'm not sure if they were dead because there was a lot of blood. - How many bodies were there? - A lot, I don't know... All up there... They were carrying dirt, bricks, manure from there... - How many bodies? - There was a line of people. Many, I can't tell exactly, I didn't see. - Then I saw Isaac. - Let's go. He was walking with the others... (Russian) - No photographs. - In this line. This kind of shovel? Yes, a short one, military style. Then l came back here and spotted him on the ground, right here. Who was lying here? Isaac. He wasn't there before. Someone brought his body over and placed it here. I dropped my shovel next to his body when I passed by. The handle was stained with something. I don't know what it was. I couldn't get it off my hands for a while. Do you have anything else to say? No. Nothing more. Okay. I also saw there before... This is not a prison. It's a hospital. Even a prison has some visiting hours. Your husband is very ill, you know that? This means his treatment is really intense. Even if you were allowed to visit him, there would be no use because he wouldn't recognize you. I don't care. I just want to see him. Sorry, I can't help you. That's the order. He can't have visitors. But you can write a request to the doctors' committee and they will consider it. But I did, I wrote them thirty times. Unfortunately, I can't help you. Try again.
