You guys want it? You want it? All right! Ready? All right. Have a good day at work, Daddy. You too. Pshh! Pshh! Have fun at school, okay? - How're you doing? - Good. How are you? Good. Here you go. - I love you, sweetie. - I love you, too, Dad. Have a good day. Bye. Jimbo, let's go. Gotta go. Bye! Say your last goodbye, boys. See ya, girl. Be safe. - Excuse me? - Hey. Hey. Sorry to bother you, but are you throwing this away? Yeah. Hate to see her go. She's been a good friend. "She"? Old Betty. - You name your grills? - Oh, yeah. We had a lot of good times together, but I just a new Grill Master to replace her. Well, does Old Betty still work? She's seen better days. Huh. Grill Master 750. Compatible with a 20-pound hopper, center-barrel ignition... I don't know. Seems kinda cruel to throw a nice old lady like this to the curb. You mind if I take her? Wow, you know your grills. Well, I've never named one, but I've flipped a burger or two in my time. I'm Gia. Gianna, actually, but Gia for short. Jim Dunlap. James, actually, but Jim for short. Just moving? I am, yeah. A few blocks over. Just doing the last of my moving loads. Nice. Well, welcome to the neighborhood. Thank you. Uh, can I interest you in a Parker Boyle Deluxe 1400 day crib? Oh, so you name your furniture, too, huh? Lizzy's my daughter. Just thought I would bring it out front here. Seems it will go faster than in front of my house. Lizzy, that's a cute name. Cuter kid. Yeah, I don't doubt it. Anyway, I'm... I'm good on cribs. - Mm-hmm. - So... no takebacks. You sure you want to take this? I don't know if you'll get this thing started again. Won't get it started again? Wanna bet? Oh, you don't want to do that. I never turn down a bet. Yeah, me neither. What's our wager? Ten bucks? 20. Deal. You're on. Well, in that case, I should help you load it up in your truck. Oh, sure, that would be great. Uh, Mo, want to give me a hand? Yeah. She's taking Old Betty off our hands. Oh, lucky gal! Luckier grill. Okay. One, two... Thank you so much! Hey, no problem. So, what area are you moving into? You said close by, right? Lakeside. I'm Lakeside, and the house right next to me just sold, actually. Seriously? Always. 20748? Well, hello, neighbor! Literally. Well, um, yeah, if you ever need any help with your grill, or if you want to get rid of it, "neighbor," just let me know. Like I said, not likely. Uh, hey. I'm actually having a barbecue at my place this weekend. Be a good way to meet some of the neighbors, get to know some of my colleagues. You should come by. Yeah, I'd like that. Great. - See you then. - What can I bring? Yourself. All right. See you then. So when are you taking her out to dinner, this new friend? Ah, new neighbor. Right. I'll take that. Well, hello, new neighbor. All right. Now how am I gonna get you down? - Hi. - Hi! I'm Karen Wagner. I live just down the lake, two houses over. I didn't mean to interrupt, but I just wanted to welcome you to the neighborhood. That's so sweet of you. And fast. Oh, yes, well, these were actually for a bake sale. I made a few extra, so it is a little bit of a cheat. Well, thank you. I'm Gia, by the way. Oh. Oh, did... Did you want to come in? I thought you'd never ask. Ohh... Wow. Oh. Tell me these aren't to die for. Mm! Yes! They are to die for. - Right? - Mm-hmm. Oh, I love how open your kitchen is. I would love to get an open concept like this, but it's a little hard to save on a firefighter's salary. - Oh, you're a firefighter? - No, not me, my husband is. I'm a designer. You know, houses and offices. I love color. That is my thing. Oh. You have great taste. Well, I was a designer, until the company I worked for downsized, and I'm still not working. But, you know, I am thinking of starting my own firm, so that's kind of exciting. But enough about me! Tell me about you. What do you do? You work? Uh, yeah, yeah, I work. - For...? The city. Parks department. Parks department? Well, that sounds interesting. Kinda. So, what brings you here? The job, and, well, I needed a change, a fresh start, so to speak. Break-up? Something like that. So why come to the burbs on the lake, instead of the city, where all the action is? I mean, if I was single... You're single, right? I could tell! I would be mowing the grass on the other side of the fence, if you know what I'm saying! Yeah, well, I... I just got tired of renting, and living lakefront felt like what I needed right now. Plus, the price on the house was right. Well, you picked a nice neighborhood. Good people! Now "Tykee"... Oh, that's his nickname... He lives about five doors down, he is a little quirky, but generally harmless. And then there is Liz Hassle, now she's a bit of a chatty Cathy, so don't get cornered by her, because she will literally suck the life out of you. I am serious, we had this sweet little old man, he lived down the street. He literally died while talking to her. Literally! Hmm! Okay, well, I'll be careful. I, uh, I did meet Jim the other day. Oh, you did? Oh, Jim's great! He is Mo... that's my husband... His best friend, and they work together. Oh, well, I met him at the firehall. Oh, well, maybe you saw my Mo, then... big guy. Cute. Almost as cute as Jim. Ah. Almost forgot. Fresh break-up. I get it. Men are not on your radar. Well, Jim's a single dad. He has an adorable little daughter named Lizzy, and she's best friends with our daughter, Julia. Oh. Well, maybe you can help me. I'm actually developing a new children's playground for the town. Maybe you can tell me what things are her favorite? Well, Jim and Lizzy might be able to help you with that. Our Julia, she can't use the children's parks in this town. You daughter can't use a kid's park? I've never heard of that before. Oh, Julia has cerebral palsy. And she's still hitting some of her major milestones, but keeping her balance and posture isn't possible. I'm so sorry. Oh, no need to be sorry! Our Julia is... well, she's perfect in every way. But a typical playground is not made for kids like her. That's... That's really unfortunate. It is. Hey. You take your time getting over your breakup and the healing of your heart, and remembering from years gone by... Oh, it's the worst. Thank you. I will. And thank you for this warm welcome, really. Oh, it's my pleasure! It's gonna be so nice to have a new face around here. Oh! Jim's having a barbecue this weekend. You should come. He actually already invited me. Did he, now? Well, well... well, all right. I'm not gonna poke you about it anymore. Later, 'gator! Bye! Bye. Mm. Hmm, hmm. I just don't get it. What's wrong with a normal park? Well, nothing, except the town already has six, but an inclusion playground... There isn't one. Look, look. Do you see the teeter totter here? It has a seat with a strap. And the swing set will have the same thing. So... all of it's padded? Yes, everything is to spec from Inclusion Playgrounds. It is such a great program, I can't believe more cities and towns aren't doing this. Well, it's because most town councils think it's too expensive. Well, with a little outside funding, it actually saves them money. Oh, is that so? Well, why don't you just draw me up a full prospectus, and I can take it to council, yeah? Okay! On it. But you'll have to find a lot for it. What about the one that you were considering for the regular playground proposal? Yeah, I haven't come up with anything yet. Oh. Okay. Well, I've been researching a few, so I can circle back when I figure out which ones work. Sure. Get me that prospectus, yeah? Great. And the link for this should be in your inbox for further review, if you want. Great. And, uh, finally... nice to finally meet you in person. Welcome to town... and to the job. Thanks, Don. I just don't understand why you couldn't have found a house closer to home. My new job is here, Mom. I wasn't gonna commute eight hours. Well, then why couldn't you find a job closer to home? You know, look, honey, I know how hard this has been, and all the more reason you should be close to the people who love you. My whole world was wrapped around his world, Mom. His friends... everywhere I went, there they were. And I know it was always with the best intentions, but I just... I can't have everyone feeling sorry for me all the time. I needed this. We just hate to think of you being alone, sweetie. I know, I know, and I love you and Dad for that, but the truth is, I felt more alone at home. I like it here. Mom, hold on a second. I'll call you back, okay? Love you, sweetheart. I'm only a phone call away... Don't forget that. Well, hello there. Hi. Here. These are for you. Oh, aren't these beautiful? My dad helped me pick them. He did, did he? Now, let me guess... you must be Lizzy? Well, this is very thoughtful of you, Lizzy. I'm Gia. Nice to meet you. My dad also wanted me to remind you that the barbecue started. Would you like to come? I sure would. How about I put these in some water and then you can show me the way? Okay. Hold on two secs. Do you know how to dancece? Whoo! 1,250-square-inch, 40-pound hopper, dual-intake ignition. - Dual? - Mm-hmm. It's a thing of beauty, man. You deserve it. Thanks. "Thing of beauty," indeed, Jimbo. I'm really gonna have to have a talk with Karen. Mine's three years old now. I thought she was six. Not our daughter, Janelle. The barbecue. Barbecue's three. - Oh. - Yeah. All right. I'm gonna take these up to the kids. Enjoy. Hey. You made it. Escorted here by the chair of the neighborhood-welcoming committee. Good job, kiddo. Julia's upstairs, playing. She's waiting for you. You wanna take this? - Yeah. - Thank you. - Bye, Lizzy! - Bye. You were right. She's adorable. The apple doesn't fall far from the tree. Right. I didn't know what your favorite was, so I just went with my favorite. Oh! Pink lemonade. Just happens to be my favorite, too. Oh, well, good choice, then. Wow! I love your deck. It's like a... an oasis. Yeah, the job can be kind of hectic, so it's nice to kind of build a little paradise at home. Oh. Hey, everyone! Can I get your attention, please? This here is Gianna Summers, she's our new neighbor. Gia, everyone. Hey, everyone! Hi! Are all your neighbors firefighters? Some of them just got off shift, so invited them over, but, for the most part, we're all family. Howdy, howdy. I'm so glad you made it. Me too! Mo! Gia, I want you to meet Mo, my husband. Friends call him "Big Mo." Ah. Parents were fans of Three Stooges? Nailed it! And yes. Middle school was brutal. Well, it is nice to officially meet you, Big Mo. Jim, Mo, and the crew helped load my new grill into my truck at the station. Ah. "New" is a little bit of a stretch. Oh, just wait and see what I can do with her. Ah. Can I get you something? Pink lemonade on the rocks? - Pink lemonade would be great. - Comin' up. Mm. Let me guess. Taurus? "Taurus"? - Karen's really into astrology. - Mm. Thought it was kind of weird when we first met, but now I think it's kind of cute. Mm! - Well, I am actually a Taurus. - Knew it! So intuitive. Mm. Oh, okay, okay, enough with the P.D.A. These two have been married for, like, - 10 years, and they can't... - 12. - 13, baby. - I knew that. Mm. 13 years, and still act like newlyweds. Uh, so, are you gonna show me what replaced Old Betty? Yes! I will. Come this way. - Talk to you later! - Bye. So, they're your best friends? Yeah. And a godsend. They help out with Lizzy all the time when I'm on shifts. What's the saying? "Takes a village"? Boom. That one. Grill Master 1250. Cast iron. 40-pound hopper. Dual ignition? Whew. She's a beaut! What'd you name her? "New Betty". How original. Got an 1150 myself. 40 burgers at once. Ever seen that before? The 40 burgers or the grill? Both. Uh, no, I can't say I have. Janelle Munson's the name. Wow. That is a strong handshake! Jim tell you about our fundraiser? - Uh... - Uh, no, I have not. Janelle, I just met Gia. She's new to the ar... Colleague of ours, passed away recently. Got a GoFundMe page started for his family. T.J. Haislet. Great man. Missed. Any help you can offer would be appreciated. I am so sorry to hear that, and, yes, I will definitely check it out. Excellent! Got an email? Uh, yes. Got a phone? Yep, I got that, too. Gonna pull it out? Oh. Uh... yes. Yeah. Okay. And zapped ya. Now my contact's in your contacts. So, text me. Will do. Oh. Right now? Never a better time than the present. 'Kay, yep. Whoo! "Holy crow" is my middle name. Hey, what's going on over there? Don't worry. I got some for you, too. It's not, really. It's Barb... father's mother. Not for "Barbecue," like one might think. Ahh. Tch. These two are my unofficial taste-testers. Mm! Oh, you have outdone yourself this time, Jimbo. Might be the best yet. You want to try? 'Course I do. Mm. Not bad. Jim is the five-year champion. The champion of what? Uh, Labor Day County Barbecue Contest. Duh. The most prestigious barbecue contest ever. "Prestigious"? Whatever comes off Jim's grill is off-the-charts, amazingly, exquisitely, mouth-wateringly great. They brag about it! A lot! Well, it is good. Curious. Have you ever thought of adding a little cinnamon? Sometimes, I even go a step further and I dice up some limes, stick 'em in the foil. Gives it that extra perfect kick. Oh, you know your grills. Yeah, I've been told I'm not bad. Especially with vegetables. Vegetables? Oh? Interesting. Do you guys make your own sauce? Is the sky blue? Okay, well, you got me there. It's usually Mr. Stubbs for me. From a jar? - Ho! - Okay hold on, hold on. Don't give the lady a hard time. Clearly, she's confident about her grilling. I sure am! You smell that, Mo? I smell a challenge. Oh, you sure do. - Ooh... - Ooh! Did you tell Jim about the children's playground you're building? She works for the city. Ah. I actually... I wanted to talk to you about that. After our chat the other day, I made some changes to the proposal. It's now an inclusion playground. Are you serious? Yeah! Yeah. I spent all of last night researching and I flipped the proposal entirely. Wow! That sounds like a pretty awesome thing. I mean, Julia would absolutely love that. Well, consider her the inspiration behind the changes. My boss, Don Hamilton, is reviewing it right now. Don Hamilton. What? We're... We're not fans of Don's? It's not that we're not fans of Don, but... Speak for yourself, Jimbo. All Don cares about is who can put the most dollars in his pocket. Really? How so? Well, we've been trying to get him to give us approval to build a gym for our firefighters, in our back lot behind the station. But it's been two years, and every time we think we're getting approval, there's more "red tape," like he likes to put it. So don't count on your park, is all I'm saying. Unless, of course, you got a major donation for his Mayor candidacy. Or his snack stash. Man's a glutton for the snacks. What? He loves to snack. Well, maybe I can try and help. Any chance I could come by and check out the parking lot? How's Monday? It's a date. Great. Well, let's get this barbecue started before the food gets cold, all right? - All right! - Sounds good. Let's go, buddy. I'm starving! Oh, hi, Gia. What can I do for you? I just wanted to say how excited my team is about the inclusion playground. Right! Right. Yes. I'm gonna need that prospectus. Yes. We are working on it. So hey, I met some of the crew from our local fire station and they mentioned something about needing a gym for the firefighters. Something about their parking lot? Ah. That's our parking lot. You know, city property. They already have plenty of real estate for that, uh, fancy new renovated firehall of theirs. I see. Curious why that land wouldn't work for them, though, as it's not being used. Is there another bid on it - or something? - Another bid? There's plenty of bids. Oh. I see. Eh... ah... Look at this. But our land for the playground... That's safe, right? Look. Everyone is bidding on everything, all the time. Nothing's in the bag. Oh. Okay. I just... I thought that was a done deal. I thought it was about assigning a lot. Gia, Gia. Look, I'm gonna be straight with you, okay? It's all about the funding. Now, you get me the funding, and I'll get you the land for your, um, you know. "Inclusion playground." The inclusive park. That's right. Okay. Well, uh, how much? How much to guarantee it? - 100k. - Seriously? Well, the good news is I'm assigning you to it, right? So, nothing's gonna stop you from raising the money. Right. Okay. Well, what about the firefighters, then? Maybe I could take that on as well, help them with their fundraising? I mean, we all know they're underfunded. Isn't everyone? But would it be okay to help them? You know, as long as you make a point of letting the Chief know. The Fire Chief? Yeah, that we're making an effort to help them. Here. Have a poster. Right. All right, people, stay safe out there. - Hi. - Hi. I'm looking for Jim. I'm guessing this is a bad time. Uh, no, he's not on this call. Chief Reed. Gia. I'm Jim's new neighbor. Oh. Nice to meet you. He's, uh, around back. Oh, great. Oh, uh, Don Hamilton, from Parks and Rec... What about him? He's my boss, and, uh, he actually has given me permission to help you guys with the gym you've been needing. Oh, he did, did he? Mm-hmm, yeah. He wanted me to let you know. Yeah, I bet he did. Listen, any help you can offer, we'd greatly appreciate. I'll lead the way. Great. Just let me grab something. So, how long have you been working for Don Hamilton? I actually just started. Whoo! Jim? You got a visitor. Oh, look who it is. - Hey. - Came to drop off Old Betty? Ah, I'd just roll her over to your place, if that was the case. I actually came by because I wanted to share some good news. - And to give you this. - Oh? As a thank-you for the invite the other day. It was so nice getting to know your friends and everyone in the neighborhood. A cookbook for the grill? Jim should be making his own book for the grill. Hey. Eye on the prize, Janelle. Eye on the prize. Ah, zip it, Barbie. Okay, well, anyway, the good news is my boss gave me permission to help you guys out. - Really? - Yeah. To be honest, it felt a little bit like a consolation prize for the fact that he still hasn't guaranteed the playground proposal. He didn't guarantee it? But that's your boss and it's a city project. Sounds like it's about the money. Again... about the money. Yeah, so I guess I'm gonna have to do some fundraising to guarantee it. Well, whatever help you need, you can count us in. Thank you. I will. So, your gym... tell me about it. It's cold and concrete. And non-existent, as you can see. We lost the gym when we did our renovations and we haven't had one since. And as you can see, we've been making do with makeshift spots around here. And a local gym, that won't suffice? Pilates studio count? - Where Mo is a regular. - And the Pope's a woman. Should be. The answer's no. We don't have a local gym. The closest one is the next town over. Okay, and so this is the parking lot that you want to do it in? Yeah, that's right. Why didn't you do it in the renovation? It's officially the city's land and we don't have approval. Needed this space for our trucks and essential gear. Why didn't you get approval? That seems so odd, no? Mm, you could say, maybe, it's an old rift between the firefighters and Don Hamilton. It's his third year running for Mayor, and the Chief won't give him our support. He thinks that's the reason why he keeps losing. I see. You know, Karen actually made the designs for the gym... which we might never get. With a color palette that includes turquoise... That I hope we never see. Hey. Karen likes turquoise... A color which could actually complement your charming personality, I might add. Hey. But I'm sure Karen would just love to help you with your designs, if you needed her to. Yeah, at the very least, we can help you with the inclusion park... Fundraising for it. We love what you're doing, and it's for a good cause, and it's well needed. We would love to get behind it. Thank you! That's amazing. And I'll poke around and see if I can get you guys your gym. Joining forces. I like this. On one condition... The challenge. Oh, the barbecue challenge? That's right. We still need to talk about... Oh-oh, we got to go. Yeah, of course. We'll talk. Well, hopefully, sooner than later. - Yeah. - Hey, Jim. You can come this way. So do you have any ideas? I do. Don gave me approval - for a 10- - K race and the city's gonna help promote it. Ooh. Well, I've never been much of a runner, but hey, I'll try anything once. Thank you. Did you see the movie "Promising Young Woman"? - Mm-hmm. - Inspo for the nails. Nice! Speaking of inspiration, I wanted to ask you... When you first told me about your idea for the park, and I told you about Julia having CP, I felt like... maybe you have a... connection to it, or you're familiar? Maybe you know someone? Yeah, you're right. I am familiar with it. Huh. Hey! Let me do yours next. Sure. Why not? You were saying? My... My sister-in-law. Ex-sister-in-law. She has cerebral palsy. Ex-sister-in-law? Hmm. Still a sensitive subject? I get it. The point is, you really helped me focus. You know, this... this park, it's, it's important, it's important to the community and you. And it's important to me. It's something that I needed to do. To give back. Thank you. That really means a lot. Okay. Funding. This is good, but it won't get us to our goal. Let me think on this. Ooh! The firefighters have their annual calendar. Shoot. Maybe I could talk to the Chief, see if we can build a lot more publicity this year, we could bring in a lot more money. That would be killer. Oh! Speaking of which, I totally thought that was gonna happen in the movie, didn't you? But, like, at the beginning of the movie, not at the end. Whoa! That was really hard. Such a good movie. Important. Really hard to watch at the end, but needed. Keep going. Oh! Trending on TikTok! Ah! Let's do pink next. Outside the house... ♪ I st Keep your hands up. Hands up, right? ♪ ...I never found out... ♪ ...Play ukulele... Keep practicing your punch. I'm gonna get the mitts, okay? ♪ ...But I never looked twice crossing the street ♪ Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Hey, Lizzy. Whatcha doin'? Boxing. Nice. Every girl should know self-defense. Let's see what you got. Oh! A duck! Okay. Yeah! Hard! Duck. Nice! Whoa! Yeah! Oh. Boxing, gardening, making people feel good in the community. You an expert at everything? Uh, well, you see, there's this saying... "if you can't handle the heat... " get out of the kitchen. No pun intended. Yeah, it's time for your session with Miss Kimble, honey. Let's do one more and then we'll go, okay? You ready? Let's go. Whoa. Whoo. Good job! Whoosh, pew! Pew! Bye, Gia. Bye, sweetheart. Yeah, it's an online Zoom thing. Oh, nice. What kind of class? Oh, it's not a class. It's therapy. Oh. Nothing serious, you know. It seems like having a dad who's a firefighter has created some anxiety. You know, nightmares, here and there. That's tough. You know, T.J. Haislet, who worked with us, he was a close family friend, and losing him was... hard on everyone, right? Especially Lizzy... She's been quiet about it, so I think she's having a difficult time... Scared she might lose her dad. Yeah, well, you have a very dangerous job. Yeah. And I guess there's no way to be a firefighter without going to the fires. Unless you're the Chief. He usually stays behind. Right, but I'm guessing it takes a long time to climb that ladder, so to speak. Funny you mention that. I actually just got offered a position yesterday. - What? No way. - Yeah, Chief Reed's retiring. That's incredible. When do you start? Oh, no, no, I'm not gonna... I'm not gonna take it. No. I feel like I should... Owe the crew to stick around. We're kind of a tight-knit unit. Oh. Yeah. Oh! You... - You wanna...? - Mm-hmm! Okay, you mean business. The jacket came off! Of course I mean business. Oh, let's see how hard you hit here, sister. Okay, all right. - Ready? - Yeah. Yeah? Yeah? Oh! Oh, and by the way, thanks for the cookbook. - I read it twice already. - You did, did you? Okay, so you learned a few tricks you didn't know you didn't know? Well, not necessarily, but I did get some inspiration for my own cookbook. Mm, which we have established will not include vegetables. Hey, that reminds me. We need to talk about our barbecue bet. I saw the three at the end of that combo. Ahem. The barbecue bet. I mean, unless you're backing out. - Backing out from a challenge? - Yeah. Not a chance. Okay. Okay, okay. Well, we need some ground rules. Okay. Homemade barbecue sauce. But aren't you the jar lady? I know, but I'm gonna learn how to make my own. You know, new horizons. I like that. Agreed. Okay, but same meat... Apples to apples. No vegetables? - Maybe a few. - All right. So when are we starting this? A few weeks? Gives me some time to get the new grill all fixed up. You mean my old grill. Hey. Old Betty is mine now. Ha. Good luck with that. Oh! You know, I'm actually not bad at fixing things. I noticed your porch light flickers. But it's not the bulb, it's an electrical problem. - Really? - Mm-hmm. Let me know if you want me to take a look at it. You know where to find me. Hi, Gia. Hi! You gonna help me? Working. She's a beaut! Okay. Uh-huh. You scared yet? Okay, now you can go the other way. Good job! So who are your friends at school? - Alexander. - Alexander? Who's Alexander? He's about to get married to me. You're going to marry? You know who you're going to marry? Who's Alexander? He's a friend at my school. He's... He's five. Did you know this? No. I didn't... I need to meet this guy. Rewind. Back that up. So you're gonna tell me. I went over to him and I said "Hi. What's your name?" And then he said "Alexander," and then I said... It's too tight. I'm sorry. There's too many bumps. Almost got it. Maybe Gia could help? Uh, now what makes you think she can do a better job than me? She can box better than you and she can grill better than you. Oh, she can now, can she? Huh. I bet she's a good mom. Except she has no kids. Then I bet she'll be a good mom. I bet you wish you had a mom, don't you? All my friends do. I know. You're the best dad in the world. Just, sometimes, I just wish for that. Oh. Come here. Let me look at you. Hold on. I think I've mastered the bun. I guess it works. But next you have to watch that YouTube video for braids. Don't forget. You promised. All right. Pshht. All right, let's get you going. Braids, huh? Okay. How'd it go, boys? What am I, chopped liver? "People." - How'd it go, people? - Better. Thank you. They had some old Christmas lights kept up. Yeah, luckily, we got there in the nick of time and no lives were lost. House is wet, but it's saved. Well, good job, fellas. Seriously? "Folks." Good job, folks. - Jim, you got a minute? - Yeah. So, you put any more thought into filling my boots? Uh, those are some big boots to fill, Chief. Yeah, well, 30 years and they're tired. And I want to play with my grandchildren while I still got the energy. As you know, my retirement party is the same day as the Labor BBQ. I gotta know before then. I know. I'm still thinking about it. I can see that. You're hesitant and I don't know why. You're a born leader. Thanks, Chief. Hey. - Hey. - What was that about? Ah, nothing. Right. So, how's it going with the new neighbor? Good. She's being really keen about this competitive grilling thing. A lady who likes a challenge and barbecue... Sounds like a lady for Jim Dunlap. Ah, don't start that. Let me ask you something... When is that last time you went on a date? A date? Yeah. You know, sitting with a pretty lady, passing the time. Every morning, evening, and a little time in between. Her name is Lizzy. You know what your problem is? I have a lot, and I'm pretty sure you're gonna tell me some more. You think you have to do this alone. This? Parenting. Life. But you don't. I know, that's why I got you and Karen. You know we're always here for you, we're family, but I'm just saying maybe it's time to let your walls down and let someone in. For your and Lizzy's sake. And you think it's that competitive blond girl next door? What do you got against blond girls? Nothing. I know they have fun, but I just never dated one, is all I'm saying. Even more reason to try new things. Anyways, I gotta get going. I got to get my stuff ready for my class tomorrow. Class? Yeah, barbecue saucing, the fundraiser for the park. Ah, wish I could make it, but I'm actually on shift tomorrow. Oh, yeah, that's right. Is Gia gonna be there? No. Why would Gia be coming? Because... ♪ This love ♪ Is on fi-i-i-ire ♪ This love is on fire... You need some singing lessons. - Is that smoke? - Stop. Somebody call the fire department... La, la... Because this love is so hot! Ooh! Ooh! Ah! Gotta put that fire out! - Leave me alone, bruh. - Sizzle, sizzle! I'm gonna getcha! You sound good. I am. And out of breath. What are you doing? Speedwalking in the neighborhood. Trying to get in shape for a marathon fundraiser - I'm putting on. - For work? Yeah. So how's the neighborhood? It's lovely, actually. I didn't think I'd fall into this place so easily. Fall into this place? Sounds like you've made a few friends, then? I have. Mom? What are you doing? Oh, I'm sorry, honey. I'm just trying to get this living room clean and get your father off his butt. So... my neighbor's really nice. A father. Really, really sweet little girl. Single parent? Is he divorced? I'm assuming. I haven't asked. Is he handsome? Yeah. Yeah, he is, actually. Hey... Hey, Mom, can I... Can I call you back? Yeah, sure, honey. Have fun. Handsome neighbor, she said. Hello! My name is Jim Dunlap, and I'm a firefighter here at Maple Plains Fire Department, as many of you may know, but my real job is teaching this barbecue class. And this here is my daughter and sous chef, Lizzy. I'm six years old! She's six years old. Now, making your own BBQ sauce is a lot easier than you think, but it bears the skills that reward with fortitude, patience, and lots of ribs! Gia! Hey, you. Well, well, well, look who it is. Jim Dunlap's barbecue class? Now, how could I pass that up? See, I have this little competition coming up... I could use a few pointers. Right. Well, luckily for you, we have an open spot. - Have a seat. - Excellent. So everyone has all their ingredients that they love and hold dear? Well, let's get this show started, shall we? Hey, Lizzy! Can you show me where the ingredients are? Sure! Come over this way. This way? Okay. Oh! All right. What should I start with? Probably the vinegar. The vinegar has the most... That's an excellent idea! Vinegar. Okay. And if you want to beat my dad... So next, I like to add a little molasses. That's more Kansas City style, gives it a little tanginess. Then I like to add a little garlic... some black pepper... and some salt. Don't forget the onion powder! Right. Onion powder. Thank you, sous chef. And mix that up. So I'm gonna walk around and check everybody's sauces. Good job. What about a little paprika, chef? I'm not really a big fan. All right, well, dare I suggest lime? See, I prefer the lime as a rub so that it burns into the smoke. Yeah, but if you sear the sauce on the meat, it becomes tacky, and won't that diffuse the lime, rather than having it smoked into it? Well, it's a matter of taste. All right. Well... you are gonna taste mine. Yours? No way. Yeah. Come on, Dad. It's good, right? I mean, it's all right. Okay, Lizzy, you try it. Yum! Hey, teammate! You're not supposed to say "Yum!" You know I'm gearing up to have a barbecue-off with her, right? She's gonna beat you, Dad. - Do you have to go? - No, no. I'm not on shift right now. Jim! We got a structure fire. We're gonna need you on this one. Oh, uh, do you mind watching Lizzy for me? Yeah, of course. I'll see you when I get home, okay? Mwah. - Be safe, Daddy! - I will! It's okay, sweetie. Let's go, guys. Let's go, let's go. Wow. That was good. Pasta, Parm, butter, and veggies. It's one my mom used to serve me when I was your age. It was my favorite! It's my favorite now, too. What's your Mom's name? Jean Margaret. But we call her Jean, for short. Is she nice, like you? She is. And your mom? She's not here anymore. Oh. Hey. Look at the time. We better get you ready for bed. Did you hear from my dad yet? No, sweetie, not yet. Hey, but listen. I know your daddy has a dangerous job, but he is a very skilled man. Very well-trained, and he's with your Uncle Mo, who's the same. And your dad is very brave... Just like you are, when you're waiting for him when he's out on a job. And I can't imagine what you're thinking, but... You don't have anything to worry about, okay? I promise. That's what my Aunt Karen always says, too. Good. Let's get you upstairs. And how about I give you a piggyback? 'Kay. All aboard! Whew! Here we go. Hey. Hi. I'm so sorry. I must've dozed off. What time is it? Early. I think about 6:30. Looks like she's still asleep. Yeah, normally doesn't wake up until around 7:00 or so. Oh. Here. Always double up on the water. Thank you. Drink? Oh. Private stash, huh? Of course. Cheers! Cheers. So... how was she? She was an angel. Honestly, Jim, she was an absolute pleasure to watch. Well, thank you. I really appreciate it. Normally, Mo and Karen take her, but this just made things a little, well, less chaotic. Yeah, I bet. How... How was it? The call? Oh, it was big one. It was an apartment building. Everyone okay, though? Unfortunately, no. There was a man on one of the top floors, who was sedated, but it's unclear if it was because of the smoke or medication. Um, he d... he didn't wake up. And Mo, he... He tried his hardest. But it wasn't possible, in the end. I'm so sorry. How's Mo? Broken leg, maybe? He's still at the hospital. He broke his leg? One of the floorboards gave way, but he's safe, and that's all that matters. Yeah. Never noticed those before. Those rings? Your parents? Um... No, they're... they're mine. And my husband's. The reason I moved out here... and bought a house and I started over, is... my husband, he passed. Ohh. I'm so sorry, Gia. Yeah, it was cancer. We had only been married a few months. We were just starting to look at houses when he got the news. And four months later, he was gone. Anyway... after over a year of living in that apartment, I just... I just couldn't do it anymore. His friends and his... His family... I realized that I couldn't move on because... they couldn't move on, and they couldn't move on because they didn't think that I could move on. Man. Grief is cruel, man. It fools you into thinking you have the upper hand. You know, you get these moments where you feel normal, you can breathe, and then, out of nowhere, it just snatches the breath right out of you again. Lizzy's mom... she... she died while giving birth to her. Oh, my gosh, I'm so sorry. I had no idea. I just... I just thought you were divorced. Well, wouldn't that have been easier, right? Um... it was a blood disorder. Nothing we knew about. The doctor said there was nothing more that he could've done, so. That's so terrible. But, just like you, I wanted a fresh start. So, me and Lizzy, we're originally from New York, that's where she was born. And I met Mo at a firefighter training course we took back East. It was actually him who convinced me to come here. So, I picked up and moved. That's very brave of you. Must be so hard... being a single parent. It is. It's a lot of responsibility. And you know, most parents want to give their child what they're lacking, and... and in my case... it's a mom... A woman in her life that's all hers. Maybe one day. Who's to say you won't find the perfect match? "Who's to say I won't," is right. And tonight it really hit home... It put into perspective that I'm all she's got. You know? It has been so nice getting to know you and Lizzy, Jim. You are an exceptional dad. You're a brave firefighter and you've been a really great friend. You've made me feel... happy. Which I didn't think was gonna be possible again. Same. You're quiet. Yeah? Hadn't noticed. Come on, man. What's going on? Know you well enough to see you're thinking on something. All right, well, just thinking about you, actually. Thanks, man. You know I love you, but... No, not like that. That's... It's the other night, when you busted your leg. That, uh, brought back memories about T.J., when we lost him. Yeah. Just showed me how close we live on the edge, you know? Well, just a busted-up leg here, so we are all good. Yeah, but it could've been worse than that, man. Always can be... but... it's just part of life, being a firefighter, right? Yeah. Chief offered me the job. To be the new Chief? Yes! That's amazing. And not surprising. I always knew, when the time came, you would be the choice. So why the contemplative look? You know you're supposed to be happy, right? Because we're first-responders, man. We respond to the most dangerous things imaginable, and you've always had my back as much as I've always had your back... Especially when things went south. I just wouldn't feel comfortable sending you out there without me. I'm not taking the job. You're not taking the job? Jim. I know you're scared. I get that. We are all scared. All of us... Everyone in this world. It's life. But let me ask you something. What would be the best part of being Chief? Best part would probably be the worst part, I guess? Being Chief would take you out of the front-line aspect of the job, sure, but it would also put you where I know you need to be... In a leadership role, and in a spot where you, as a lone father, are safer. You'll never let me down, Jim. You're my best friend. It would be my honor... to have you as my boss. Come here. Ah, geez. My bad. I think I got your shirt wet. Well, as long as you didn't wet your pants, we are all good. So? Are you coming? Uh... When is this, again? - Saturday. - Saturday, huh? So why are there kids in wheelchairs? Because we're raising money for an inclusion playground. Children with disabilities. Oh. Oh! Right! Sorry. Senior moment. Uh, yeah, um... No, I-I don't think I'll be able to make it. Um, having lunch with the Cherwin Cable suppliers. Cherwin? I only know of the developers. Is it the same family? Yeah, it is. Ah. Curious why you'd be meeting with them? I mean, what does Parks and Rec have to do with cable suppliers- slash-condo developers? Oh, well... aren't we the nosy Nelly? Oh, sorry, yeah, none of my business. I was just... just curious. Actually, I've been meaning to talk to you about it. As you probably well know, I'm running for Mayor, yeah? Y-Yes. Yes, yes, I know. Well, I was hoping for your support. Yes, of course, yeah, you have it. Well, that's great. Happy to put up some flyers, hand them out at the race... No problem, but you know what might be really helpful? Is if you actually came. Showed your face, showed the community you're behind building such a playground. Yeah, well. Even some of the firefighters will be there, since I'm helping to get their very much-needed gym greenlit. Firefighters. Huh. Well, look, I know you're trying to help 'em and everything... Did you know that they lost a firefighter earlier this year? And just the other day, one of them risked his life at the apartment building fire on North Street? They're front-line workers, Don, they-they really need a place to work out in. Yeah, and Chief Reed knows what he needs to do to get that green light. So, this is about your political agenda, and not about city ethics? No! No, no. This is about you doing your job. Now, how about you go out and get that funding, and I'll get you the land for it? Wait, you found a spot? Well, you've been yapping so much, I haven't had a chance to tell you, have I? No. Your prospectus was great. They... They approved. So now it just comes down to the money and my final A-okay for the land. That is... That is great. Now, what about the firefighters? Now, I know you're just trying to help 'em out, but like I've said before, if the firemen want their land, they know what they have to do. Now, I've got a lot of work to do, so, uh... you get your funding, and I'll get your park. Okay. Cheese puff? Sure. De-lish. Were you an electrician in your past life, too? Ooh, I might have been. I actually learned this stuff from my dad. He made his living as a fix-it man. Ooh, sounds like my kind of guy. Yeah, you'll like him. You know, I-if he's around and you're around. Um, ahem, I have a favor to ask you. Oh, it depends what that favor is. I couldn't help but notice your name on some medals at the fire station. - - You know, 5- - K/10- - K races... Mm, she noticed my medals. Well, I may have been known for running as much as barbecuing. A lot of our fundraisers for the fire department were runs, so. Help me train for mine? Or at least give me some pointers? - Ever run a 10- - K? Walked. Oh, no... Great minds think alike. Uh-huh. Did you do the stretches I told you to do? All of them. How far are we going today? Until you can't take another step. But then we still have to get back. Well, that's how we train. 10 K is around six miles. Doesn't seem like much, but it'll push you to your limit. You'll be lucky if you do two miles today. Okay. Feeling lucky. Let's go! Oh. It's starting to rain. It's just a little rain cloud. It'll pass. Pacing is the most important thing. You want your body to get a rhythm, but keep pushing yourself more than you think, and when your endorphins kick in, that'll set your pace. The last three kilometres, we'll gradually kick it up a notch. All right, well, what's your pace? Is this working for us? Naturally, mine's a little faster than this. Hmm. I'm just saying. You'll never keep up this pace. Mm-hmm. Nice try. I had you. Okay, this is not a 40-yard dash. I just wanted to see what you had in you. Have you always been this competitive? Well, my mom said that when she was in labor with me, the doctor told her she'd be in labor for five hours, and I forced myself out in 15 minutes. You're one to talk, Mr. Winner-of- - - the- - Barbecue- - Contest five years in a row. Oh, speaking of which, we still need to set our date for our grill-off. Sauce-off. Right. It's a sauce-off now. Well, if you're gonna be using limes, you'll never beat me... Just saying. Well, I just learned that you don't like to lose, so I keep pushing back the date so I don't have to hurt your feelings. I don't want you to hurt my feelings either. Something tells me neither of us do. So... maybe we take it slow. Carefully. Yeah. Well, um, we'll take the jog slow. Okay. Come on. We're in training. We? You're in training. Oh, what? Afraid you can't keep up, slowpoke? - ♪ There's a songbird singing - Oh, it's like that? ♪ In the whitest snow ♪ And he's calling everyone "Come on, let's go" ♪ ♪ And I bet you're waiting On the other side ♪ ♪ Of the road Mm! Oh, this is good. - You are good! - Right? He's not gonna know what's coming. Hand me the smaller Phillips. Mm. Mm? Thank you. So... you and Jim? Me and Jim what? Dinners together, you fixing his light, him going on runs with you. Come on, spill the details. There's nothing to dish. Well, if you ask me... Which I didn't. You look good together. You think? And he's a Pisces. This is a perfect astrological match. Plus, Lizzy... she adores you! She can't stop talking about you, in fact. All right, all right, I'm not gonna poke around anymore. But... maybe it is time to think about opening your heart again? Seems like Jim is ready. Has Jim ever dated anyone since you've known him? Not really. A few set-ups here and there, but nothing really stuck. Yeah, I mean, most of them, they were really into him, but... I think, a lot of the time, he felt like they were maybe more interested in being a mother to Lizzy, and it's not a good enough reason to date. Love, first and foremost, has to be present, you know, with a vision of companionship and... mutual interests. So... what about you? Do you feel like maybe you're ready to move on? Maybe you could be ready to open your heart again to love? I think I already have. Yeah! Yeah! Ha! Don't be silly. Sit down. I have work to do. Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho! That makes me so happy. Oh! I have been looking into some more fundraising ideas. Oh, great. The State Alliance for Firefighters are giving special funding to whoever wins the Labor Day Barbecue Contest this year. Wait, the infamous Labor Day Barbecue Contest? - Mm-hmm. - Jim's a five-time champion. It's in the bag. Yeah, but you know, anyone can enter, though. And? So, I entered you. In a contest. Barbecue! - You did what? - Come on! It's gonna be so much fun. It's the Chief's retirement party. It's gonna be a blast. Mo and Janelle, and a bunch of the others are doing it, too. Oh, and I have heard that, you know, loves grows stronger with a little competition, don't ya know? Oh, does it now? We're all fundraising, right? This could be a way to get little extra money for the playground, if you win. Oh! And a great opportunity to gloat. Huh? All right, I'll do it. Jim and I have our own little contest going on, so this can be it. Perfect. Oh, and I spoke to the Chief about the annual firefighter's calendar shoot. Okay, I need to get you on payroll. I have never met someone who gets so much stuff done! It's a go. Proceeds from this year's calendar will go to the inclusion playground. But what about the firefighters' gym? Oh, it'll be a 50/50 kinda deal, so half of what we sell. Are we doing pre-orders? Oh! Already on it. Okay, everybody, let's get together. Gentlemen, all the helmets on, please. Yeah, fantastic. Even you. And the hose, too. Good. Good, good. - Hey, guys. - Hey! Chief! Get in there. No, no, no. My calendar days are over. It's okay. Oh, hardly! Big smiles, everyone. Big smiles. Yeah. Excellent. Back to back. Fantastic. Oh, that's so good! Girls, center around the dog a little bit. Put your helmet on. ♪ This is it, I'll admit - Nice! - ♪ I'm tired ♪ Don't you quit It's a trip ♪ Really nice. Big smiles. Nice. There it is. Nice. ♪ The stars aligned when I saw you ♪ ♪ I'm ready to say "I'm here to stay" ♪ ♪ I used to feel empty-handed ♪ But when I'm with you ♪ I'm here to stay ♪ Oh-oh I'm here to stay ♪ There you are! That was great. Yeah, I think I had the arm workout of a lifetime. Lizzy's small, but she's solid. Well, thank you so much. - Oh, you better thank Chief. - Thank you, Chief Reed. - Really. - You're welcome. Julia... she's family, so we do what we gotta do. And some good news... We raised more money than expected. From the pre-sales? Well, the calendar shoot, and the State Alliance of Firefighters... They donated as well. - Really? - Yeah. I guess they wanted to honor my retirement, and to bring in the new chief... Whoever that might be... With a little more energy. We got a PST. - Want to ride with? - Oh, no. I wouldn't want to get in the way of an emergency. No, I wouldn't suggest it if it was. Come on, when's the last time you rode in the back of a fire truck? Um, never. What about Lizzy? She has a playdate with Julia. Okay, let's do it. Yeah, all right. If it's not an emergency, why are you using the siren? It keeps us sharp! Trust me, this is a half our emergency speed. You having fun? Yeah. A lot of fun. I think they're getting married. Don't jump, sweetie! Don't jump. Just stay there! Stay there. Good! You're such a good girl! Oh! No! Don't move. Oh. Mommy's called for help. Just wait. Stay there. Oh! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you! Oh, ho, ho! Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. Thank you so much for coming. Her name is "Streisand". Big fan. She's gonna have a comeback. She's up there. You've got to get her. - This is Betty- - Anne. She works over at the bakery on Sixth. Thank God, it's you, Jim. Can you get her? First things first. What about that door on the porch? Bruce sealed that off years ago. It's a fake door. It doesn't work. - So how'd she get up there? - I don't know. But look at that face! She's terrified! You have to get her. And you're sure there's no way in through that door? It's decorative door. Never a dull moment. Mo. Hit me with Paws of Life. You got this. Ooh. You ready? Yeah. - Got me, Mo? - Oh, yeah. All right, brother. I'm getting too old for this. Hi, kitty-kitty. Huh? Hey, kitty-kitty-kitty. Go figure. The door works. It works! Whatcha doing, Dad? I'm just reading the cookbook that Gia gave me. I thought you already knew about cooking. Well, a master is always learning his craft. Knowledge is everything. I still think Gia's gonna beat you in that contest. Her mac and cheese was really good. I thought I was the mac-and-cheese king! Not anymore! Not anymore? You don't like my mac and cheese? No? Well, you're gonna like your bed even better, 'cause it's bedtime. Ready? Are you okay? I've never been better. Oh, well, look who we have here. You ready? Your coach do a good job training you? I think so. Ooh, so how are our numbers looking? Yeah. Good. Really good. We actually a lot of donations from people that aren't even running. Ooh. You looking for someone? What? No. Don't worry. He'll show. Runners to your starting marks. - Ohh... - Go get 'em, honey. - This is it. - You got this! I'll be rooting for you, right here. See you at the finish line! You ready? On your marks... get set... go! You're fast! Come on, slowpoke. Hey! Who are you calling a slowpoke? Sorry I'm late. Yeah, you are really late, but considering you've already caught up with me... Yeah, I had a meeting. Mm. That sounds important. It was. Guess who you're looking at? Uh, a really hot firefighter who's kicking my butt in this race? Yes. But you're also looking at Maple Plain's brand-new Fire Chief. What? No stopping! It's a marathon! That's so exciting! All right! - It is. And I also learned that you set a date for our grill-off, and didn't tell me? Okay, look. Karen signed me up, okay? I meant to tell you, but get ready to lose. No, she didn't. Oh, yes, she did. Grill master. Right here. - Yeah? - Can't beat me. Can't beat me! Can't beat me! How do you feel? Like I won't walk for two weeks. But exhilarated. Hey, that means it was a good run. I mean, look at all these people. We raised a lot of money. We did. Oh, hey! Oh, there they are. Let's go and see how they did. How'd you do? Oh, first. - What? - No, I took a shortcut. But I still crossed the finish line. How did you do? Top ten! - Nice! - Wow! What about me? You better start being nice to me, since I'm gonna be your new boss. - What? Really? - Yeah, I took the job. - Congratulations, man. - Oh. You deserve it. Excuse me. Hey. Yeah? Are you serious? That's amazing! Thank you. Congratulations. That was my office. They tallied the results from the race. And? We did it. That's so great! You're getting a park, Julia. This is because of you. No, Gia, look at these smiles. It's because of you. Lizzy? We did it! Yeah! Come here! We did it! We did it! Gimme a high-five. Yeah! Oh, Chief Reed? Hi. What are you doing here? I was, uh, up seeing Don. Oh. How'd it go? He's giving us the lot. For the gym. That's fantastic. Yeah. Farewell gift to my crew. How'd you convince him? Well, I told him what he wanted to hear. Support for his mayor candidacy? Let's hope he makes a better mayor than a head of Parks and Rec. Are you going up? I am. We got the park. Thanks to you guys. That's fantastic. Well, go get 'em... And I'll see you at the barbecue? - Sounds good. Bye. - Okay. Yes. Yeah, no. The papers are all signed. You can do what you want with 'em. Mm-hmm. Yeah. It's all legally yours. Yeah. Thank you for your support. Okay. Bye. Sorry to interrupt. I just couldn't wait to find out what the next steps are. When do we start digging? Gia, have a seat. Okay. Is everything okay? I saw Chief Reed outside. Heard you got the firefighters' support for your candidacy. I did. It's huge. Gets me over the finish line. Yes, well, speaking of finish lines, my office told me that the funds raised from the inclusion playground race was what us to 100K. Well, it's not enough. N-No, it is, because the firefighters, they donated to it, we raised more funds together... Do you want the bad news or the worse news? The bad news? The bad news is... the land for your park was assigned. Another group beat you to the finish line, no pun intended. Another group. Who? Well, that's irrelevant. Not to me, it isn't. Let me go out on a limb here and guess. The Cherwin family? Yes. And the worse? Well, the worse news is that, uh, your firefighter, Jim Dunlap, the Chief, well, when he made his donation to the city, he made me sign some legal papers, guarantees and stuff, and when he learned that the park couldn't happen right away, he, uh... he withdrew all his support, and took back all your so-called funding. I mean, he wasn't shy about what he wanted for them. Made me tie up everything real tight for him. It just goes to show ya, well, you try and be nice to people, they bite you in the butt. People aren't what they seem. I'm sorry. Yeah. Me too. Are you ready? Yeah. Now, it's a lot of turquoise... It's a lot of turquoise. Do you love it? But I love it. And these swings over here, they have... Gia? There you are. Here I am. Okay, can you just hear me out a minute? Hear you out? What do you want to say? You got your promotion. You got your gym. You tried to help me, but I got screwed. I know it wasn't by you, it was by my boss, but... it stung. Knowing that you took back all the fundraising... Funding that we raised together... As soon as you heard the inclusion playground was gonna be delayed. That playground was important. It was important to Mo and Karen, to Julia. And it was... it was important to me. It was closure. All that hard work for nothing. I could see how that appears. Okay. Look. What I've learned these past few weeks is that you never know what's holding you back and when to let go. Okay, look, you showed me that family and Lizzy are the most important things, and if a door opens for a better opportunity, I sure as heck am gonna walk through it. Just like you did by moving here and unselfishly making everybody's lives better. 'Kay, that playground... There isn't gonna be a playground, Jim. Okay. In theory... if I had 20 spaces in a parking lot, would that fit? In theory. I suppose, if there were enough handicap spots... What... What is this? I had Karen and one of our architects change up the plans a bit. The gym is not as big as I had hoped, but it's big enough. And there's plenty of room for the playground. I... I don't understand. Don signed it over to the fire department. We can do whatever we want. Thank you! Amazing! Thank you! I mean, I got more parking lots... There's a big one, in the back. It could fit the playground and... No way. Old Betty's back in business. Oh, ho. Look at you. Wow. And she's working. Working? She's doing more than that. She's gonna bring Mama home a trophy. - What is that? - Eggplant. - On a barbecue? - Would seem so. Ahh. Going old-school over here... Classic burgers on my grill. You've got to be kidding me, Mo. How the heck do you think you're gonna beat Jim with burgers? They're veggie. The heck is happening to you two? Turning my world upside-down. Think your world's turning upside-down with that? Wait till you see Karen's color... Eh. Stop right there. You're breaking my ears. Thanks, though, Gia, for... you know... the gym we got and, uh, helping my brother out. Mo's your brother? Ah, I tease him like he is. And that kid over there, and that cuter-than-ever extended family of mine, you just changed her life. She gets to play on a playground with her friends. And that little munchkin, well, you just made her a very happy little girl. How so? Happy parent makes a happy kid... makes a happy family. No, it's perfect. Group hug. Group hug! Come on. I said group hug. Bring it in. This feels like a trap. Yeah. I gotta go check on my meat. She's gotta be next. - For what? - Finding a life partner. We're not doing that hugging thing again. Hey! You get away, you cheater. Go. Go! Thirsty? How did you know? Gonna beat my dad? I wish I could say I will, but I'm actually not that confident. Hey! How's it going over there? Ten more minutes. Ha-ha. We'll see. Here I go. Mo. - Burger. Let's give it a try. - Yeah. Mm! Are you trying something new, Mo? Veggie. Let's just say I'm glad I'm retiring. Janelle, partner, what do you got for me? Good old ribs. The sauce is my secret. Okay. Here we go. Very nice. Very, very nice. Mm-hmm. Gia? Whatcha got here? - Eggplant. - Eggplant? Looks like ribs, but it's not. - Does look like ribs. - Okay, here we go. But does it taste like ribs? - Surprisingly good! - Right? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm! And now, our defending champion, Jim. - You know it. - What do we got here? Just some ribs. I charcoaled it. You know what I'm saying? I put some special barbecue sauce, for this special occasion. - And it's moist... - Ah. - And it's not eggplant. - Always moist. - Well... - Oh, ho... You are the champ. Let's see what you got this year. - Talk to me, Chief. - Mm! This guy, I tell ya. Okay. All right. I've made my decisions. So, I think we have an unexpected finalist here, everyone. Third place goes to... Let's give a round of applause to Janelle. Whoo! - No hard feelings, Mo. - Yeah, yeah. Before we move on, I'd like to talk a little bit about Gia Summers... A woman who breezed into town and, well, championed a new inclusion playground. So, first of all, I'd like to give you a round of applause for that. Thank you. Thank you. Whoo! But... unfortunately, it's second prize for you, and not first. But well done! And now... the winner of the Labor Day Barbecue, - the Master Contraster... - Mm-hmm. The king of barbecue cling, the ribs that need the most bibs... Most of 'em. The new Chief Jim Dunlap! Whoo! Yes, yes, yes. Okay... Let's go see. Come with me, okay? Here we go. - Second place! - Not bad. Not bad! I am so glad you moved to this neighborhood. - Me too. - Me too! I think yours was good. Don't tell my dad... It's complicated. I promise. Come here, you! She was exhausted. Looked like Mo was, too. That was nice they took Lizzy. What, you didn't hear Lizzy begging for a sleepover? If I didn't say yes, I would be hearing about it for a year. Sounds like the party's still going on. Yeah. Sounds like it. So how about it? A dance? Here? Yeah, why not? Okay, let's do it. ♪ ...And you are mine ♪ And that's fine ♪ I will protect you ♪ All the time ♪ All the time ♪ Because you're mine Look, a rainbow. Did you know that rainbows actually are circles, but they just look like arches from the ground? I've said it before and I'm gonna say it again... Is there anything you're not an expert at? Well, clearly barbecuing. Right! You're not good at that! How do I keep forgetting? I am so gonna beat you still. Well, it seems like my daughter liked it, though. Nah, she was just saying that. I don't know. Kid doesn't really lie. Especially to someone she really likes, and someone her dad really likes, too. Me. This... This guy. You? Well, me too. I really like you, too.
