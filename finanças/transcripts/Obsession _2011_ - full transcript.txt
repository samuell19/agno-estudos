DVD / DVDRip Duration: 1:35:03 FPS: 25 I request from my children and members of my family to refrain after my death from preparing any meals of grief. Not during shiva, nor the unveiling of my gravestone. l ask my children and members of my family to erect a nice grave for me. Because l did not have anything nice in my entire life. Neither a nice apartment, nor nice furniture, nor nice utensils or nice clothes. This is why l ask for a nice grave. My grave should not be tall. A low grave, very much like my own forsaken life. l request from my children to live in peace with each another. To help each other in all manners, particularly in matters of money. l did not win any due respect during my life, nor do l seek respect after my death. After my death, while it is customary to ask for forgiveness, l command that no forgiveness be requested. As l forgive not one of the members of my family.

What kind of life is this? Drop dead. know what, Sammy? They're building here buildings now. Why don't you buy... Hold your horses, Avrahamiko, l don't have money.

Stayed in the army, as usual. lsn't that a pity? -Can't be helped, Mom, he loves being in the army. The army's better than a crappy house, that's why the army's closer to his heart than home. You heard how he talked during the meal. lt's a shame people behave like that, damn him! Enough! l have to go get dressed. Blessed are you, Lord our God, King of the universe, who has sanctified us with His commandments, and has commanded us to kindle the light of the Day of Atonement. Protect my little children... Amen. What's that shirt, Sammy? What's wrong? l got you a new white shirt in the market. Don't you like it? -But that's the custom on the Day of Atonement. Everyone wears white. lt's a holy day. As You have made known aforetimes to the humble and as it is written in Your Torah: And the Lord descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of the Lord. And there it is said: "And the Lord passed by before him, "and proclaimed: "'The Lord... '" Are you insane, Sammy? lt's the Day of Atonement. - So what? Atonement... Atonement, atonement... Either way, we'll burn in hell. You're a brave kid, right? Mom, l don't know how to say this, but... Micha saw Dad smoke on the Day of Atonement. l know. lt doesn't matter. The important thing is that you study and succeed. We'll be fine, God willing. Take care of yourself. l'll send letters. Write me when you have a date for ltzik's Bar Mitzvah. Ok... with God's help. We've been waiting for an hour. Where were you? What happened? Where were you? Said goodbye to Tikva, she returned to the kibbutz, the poor thing. ls that why you have a long face? Shut up. What's wrong, my daughter? - Nothing. Hi, Faisal. When will you start talking, you moron? What kind of kid is this? Doesn't go to school, doesn't talk. Doesn't do anything. lt's a disgrace! Come here, my love. Come... Come to me... Thank you, daughter. Faisal... Where's that dog? - Sammy? Went to work. Work, huh? When will you and your husband get a decent life? He should buy you a house instead of that hellhole you live in. He's trying. - Trying... A month ago l ordered a sideboard from him. All month he says: "Today, tomorrow, today, tomorrow..." And why did he take off like that from synagogue on the Day of Atonement? He didn't feel well, poor guy. Vomited all night. Vomited all night? Probably drank and stuffed himself with all the neighborhood's punks. Disgusting. - Leave her alone, daughter. What do you want from her? Take cover! What was that? - Take cover... Why is he shouting? He wants us to go inside because of the explosion. Take cover! lt's like war. Oh God... Sit here. lt's over. This place is unbelievable. Ah well, we should just think positive... Hold on to my dress so you won't disappear. Give me a basket. Wait, sweetie, hold on to my dress so you won't disappear. What's wrong, Sammy? -Tell me, what's wrong with your produce? lt's always the same routine with you. Then don't buy any. What's wrong? l see you're uncomfortable here.

Where were you? l was worried. Where were you? Here's some "Twist". Give one to Micha. What did you want to tell me back there? Where? Next to Avraham. You winked to me. l'm doing some undeclared work... for some rich guys from Rehavia. Avraham doesn't know. Are you cheating him? Who's cheating? He can't get a job done right. What he makes in a day takes me an hour. Where are you going? To get some air. What air? You just came home. Enough, Malka, let me breathe... Why don't you stay with us? You just got home. Stay a while. Stay with us a bit. - Enough, Malka! Please, stay... - Enough, Malka! Let me breathe! Damn it... Going back to those punks again? Pass. Pass. What?

Sammy, have you thought about what we discussed this morning? What did we discuss this morning? Are you messing with me? Suramelo... l told you Suramelo wants to close his club. You, me and Abiad will take over the club. A club is... That's a great idea. Like you have the money, you monster? Shut your mouth, Abiad... He owns half the carpentry shop. He can sell his half. l don't know if my wife will let me sell the carpentry shop. lt's her father's. - "My wife won't let me"... He thinks his wife's all that... Don't you talk like that about my wife. Sit, Sammy. Even a hair from a pig's ass is a blessing. What's wrong with you? Don't you know Sammy? He'll bring all his friends. From all over, from Tiberias, Tel Aviv... lt's all good. "Dear Mom, How are you, Mom? "How's little Micha? Has he started talking a bit? "Thanks for the package.

Get some work done. Ziona... For the last time. You're pathetic. lt is said: "Gladden the beloved companions "as You gladdened Your creature in the garden of Eden." When? At the wedding ceremony. Because a woman who enters the marriage matrimony must only be interested in her husband. And her husband must only be interested in her. God forbid she should look at others nor should he. Amen. You must protect your values. Dina... l need your help. l'll find a way to help you. But just so you know, l want to sing in the club. Sing? You know how to sing? You'll make me a singer and you'll see how much good l'll do you. -Sing something. Once upon a time there was a beautiful fair lady who met a young man. She came to his house and fixed herself up. She removed her wig, her makeup, her dentures, and what was left? -She removed her brassiere as well and was left with two raisins, may it not happen to us. "Grace is deceitful, and beauty is vain "but a woman that fears God, she shall be praised." Thank you very much, everybody, and good evening. And you up there, l'm glad you joined us.

He was talland handsome... l love you. Enough, Sammy, the neighbors are outside... His name was Nils Holgersson. He was the son of a farmer and was mischievous like no other. There was not a man nor an animal that Nils didn't pick on. He pulled the cat's tail and shoved hornets into cows' ears. He tossed his wooden clogs at hens. Other than that, Nils was an idler and spent most of his days sleeping and eating. He made his parents so unhappy... Nice place. We won't tell him that. Let me talk to him. - Hello, Gavriel.

The shop will keep running, the club will be a success, we'll make good money. What do you say? From you? What about Malka?

God have mercy... lt's all because of his sins, Malka. Honorable Rabbanit, can we postpone it? Good heavens, why postpone? Because of my husband. How can we do it when he's in jail? lt's forbidden by the Law of the Torah. Mrs. Jamila, what...? The Jewish Law prohibits it. The boy has to recite his own specific Torah section. Hello hello... Where's the dog? He's not here. What do you want? -Poor kid... You're right. Do you know the woman who removes the evil eye? Go to her, she's got great powers. Doesn't speak. Why should he? There's no life for him that's worth talking about. His father doesn't love him. Pull Sammy out of your panties. Get yourself another lowlife.

Only good news. - Thank you, honorable Rabbanit. You piece of shit. Damn you. Sammy Cohen to the waiting room. Sammy Cohen to the waiting room. Do me a favor. Ask someone to bring my kids candy and something to drink. What's all this mess? Moving out, Sammy? She sold the house for me For me she sold her house. What a woman... The other one wouldn't give a share of the shop. Come on, Sammy, how could she after all the trouble you've given her? l gave her trouble? She let me rot in jail like a dog, month after month after... Forget it, Sammy. Go home, man, what's with you? You have children to feed. - No way l'm going home. l was here last week. They didn't let me in. Don't want to see her face nor the kids'. They're a pain in the ass. Why? Who didn't let you in? They said some woman had been here already. -Woman? What woman? Don't you have mercy on them? Look at Micha. Who is she? - Nonsense, no one came here. Such a sensitive, bright kid. You'll abandon him? They wouldn't let me in, l tell you. They said... Have mercy, Sammy. You'll regret it some day. Malka, l'm telling you no one came here... Did you know Micha was an accident? Accident? What accident? Thanks. She got pregnant by accident. You saw my house. One room. You can hardly breathe there. 2,000 Liras. That's what l need to settle the debt here. All l needed was another kid in there... l took her to Dr. Schtark to get an abortion. She refused. Good heavens, how did you get into so much trouble? She was yelling, made a whole scene, l couldn't control her. 2,000 Liras is half a house. How will l come up with that kind of money? Dr. Schtark saw this and said: "Another kid's not that bad..." Maybe now you'll agree to sell the carpenter's shop? That's why Micha is an accident. Everything's simple to you. How is she? Life's simple... Well... The house is a waif, the kids are nothing, What else did he say? they don't need food or clothes. What will l live on? He didn't. Plus l have the Bar Mitzvah... He's mad at you. What about the Bar Mitzvah? Can't we postpone it? No way. The Rabbi said absolutely not. He won't come back now. Can't they release you just for the Bar Mitzvah? Maybe we should give him some more time. They won't release me. Yes... Would you like to go to the movies with me? lt's a pity... They're showing "Gone with the Wind" at Orion's. They say it's something special. - What? Later we can go to Ta'amon or to Caf'e Atara, we'll have... We'll have some... l'm a married woman. l brought you some Tishpishti. A blessing from the Rabbi. A movie... Some coffee... What's that got to do with it? No, no, Avraham. l'm a married woman. l'll always be a married woman. lt's a blessing from the Rabbi. lt'll help you. Let's go... we're leaving. You want coffee? l'll make you some. Say goodbye. Sammy, you scared me. What... l don't get coffee here anymore? Here, it's Tishpishti from my wife. lt's good. Eat it. Hello, Dad. How are you, Dad? l miss you, Dad. There's no help, Dad... No help at all. Go play with Faisal. Did you hear that, Dad? Money she wants from me.

Now you ditch me like a dog? Guess who went to see him in jail? And why? You won't believe it... What do you see in that cow? Go on... Go play cards, have fun. Dina... Why do you humiliate me like this? Salim's daughter. ls this what l deserve after all these years? Are you sure? - Yes, she was there. Salim's daughter... The entire neighborhood went through her panties. - Come on, Jamila... Sleeping alone at nights? This is a holy site... - Give me a break. Thinking about you there at her place? Don't dare tell anyone. lt's not like it used to be, Malka... lt's not like it used to be. - Enough... Glad you remembered you have a father. Can they at least release you for the Bar Mitzvah? l asked but they want to put me in handcuffs. l won't go to my son's Bar Mitzvah in handcuffs. Why handcuffs? They treat me like a murderer here. l brought you some things from the supply store. Enough... Go to Great Coco's hall, Enough, Malka... Sammy, what's wrong? l gave him a down payment for the Bar Mitzvah. Take it back. And he'll give it to me? He doesn't know me. -Don't be a fool. Do as l tell you, you hear? Sammy, apple of my eyes, don't go... Do you have a girlfriend? Don't go, Sammy. Please don't leave me this way. No. Sammy, l beg you. - Let me go, Malka... Where's Mom? -She went to the market with Tikva to buy shoes. Tikva's here? - Yes, she's here. God bless her. Pull the sheet. Eat something, get some color in your cheeks. ln the front. Look in the front. l'm eating... Where you're standing... Hey, Shlomi. - Tikva! My Shlomo... Come. Come. Finally... Come, my love. Did you visit him? - Who? ls that clean? Dad. Sure. Why didn't you tell me, l'd have come with you. -Why didn't you visit him? l won't go alone. Did you talk to the supervisors? lt's hopeless, Mom. lrresponsible... Cut that crap. -Why? lt's a stain on the whole family. But he asked me to take the money he gave for the hall. What stain? What's that nonsense? Nonsense? You and your husband are a disgrace. l already took it. You should thank God a thousand times that we even put up with you. Where do you think all this is coming from? We're not beggars. My child is not a retard. And Tikva's shoes? You're a pair of lunatics, you and Dad. Cut it out! Enough! l shouldn't have listened to you. l went there for nothing like a moron. You talk too much... Like a radio. Shut up. l'll have a crappy Bar Mitzvah. - That's right. You shut up. Why can't we wait till Dad's released? Then we'll all be together. Come on, my daughter, leave him. We can't. A Bar Mitzvah is a Bar Mitzvah. That's it. -Damn him. He's an awful person. Some jail time won't kill your dad. No good will come from him. How can you say that? He's our father. That scum doesn't deserve your beauty. Always getting into trouble because he's naive. Yeah, but will she listen to you? Daddy's little girl... lt goes in one ear and out the other. Enough, you're giving me a headache. Didn't we tell you a million times to marry one of ours? He's not naive, Tikva. A million times. Now look what happened. He attracts love from everyone with his charm, with his friendliness. Enough! - Enough... Who sees to your education, huh? She followed her heart. A woman can't help that. Yeah, can't help that. Who gets you food? Who sent you to the kibbutz? Get out of here. Who arranged Shlomo's Bar Mitzvah? What? -Get out of my house and out of my life. Did you forget what happened with Shlomo? Ever since he's in jail you all think you know it all. You're kicking me out? l'm the one in jail. l've been in jail all my life. And don't you dare kiss the mezuzah, you miserable hypocrite. Come here, ltzik, honey. Let's see how your yarmulke fits. Got you... Just right. Don't listen to them. You'll have a lovely Bar Mitzvah. May you receive good news, lady, and be comforted! Goodbye! Come on, ltzhak... Cheer your mother up with ululations. l don't know how to do ululations... Oh, dear... Against the evil eye of your mother and your father... And Moses assembled all the congregation of the children of lsrael, and said unto them: "These are the words "which the Lord hath commanded, that ye should do them. "Six days shall work be done, "but on the seventh day there shallbe to you a holy day, "a Sabbath of solemn rest to the Lord; What do you want? "whosoever doeth any work therein shallbe put to death. Mom asked for money. "Ye shallkindle no fire throughout your habitations "upon the sabbath day. " Be strong and be blessed... Blessed are You, Lord our God, king of the universe, who gave us His Torah, the Torah of truth... That's all l have for you. Tell your mom to go work if she wants money. There's no one to recite the blessing over the Bar Mitzvah boy. Unbelievable. Don't come around here anymore. Amen! Be strong and be blessed! Mazal Tov! Mazal Tov! ltzik... Buy him some "Twist" with that money, Ok? ltzik... here's a little gift from me. He gave him a watch, that "Ashkenazi"... Micha... Come here... l have a little gift for you. What's that? lt's me, Nils Holgersson, l've come back home only for a short visit. 5 Liras? How are Mom and Dad? And how are the chicken and geese and the cat? That's all that dog gave you? Yeah. Yes, l know, l am tiny, l'm a dwarf. But tellme... Come. Didn't you ask for more? No. l've settled all the debts. Now you're with me. Only with me. No monkey business. Are you coming with me to him or not? -l'm not coming. Sure l'm with you... Sure l am... Take cover! Be careful... Be careful... Sammy? Sammy! What's this? A surprise. Come on out, Sammy! No way... Sammy, come out! l know you're in there with your slut! We have to stop at Tikva's kibbutz. Malka, what are you doing here? l want to say hello. Go on, get lost. Whatever you want. Sammy... Say "Sammy" again, and you're done for! Get out of here. -No way! Give me money to feed your children! Get out of here, you hear me, Malka? Don't want to go? You bitch, you don't want to go?! l'll beat the lights out of you, you stinking bitch! You won't come to this house anymore, got it? l love you, Sammy. - l'm warning you! l'm warning you! l'll beat the crap out of you! l'm your wife, you're my husband. Stop it, Sammy! Who wants to be your husband? You whore! You bitch! Stop here. You're not getting anywhere near this house, you hear? l'm your wife, Sammy! -Get out of here. And you bring the kids here? Take her home! Sammy! Sammy! l'm your wife! Sammy... Sammy, l'm your wife... You're my husband, Sammy. Your children, Sammy... lt's not worth it, Malka. lt's nothing but suffering... lt's just a pain. What did he see in her? ln that monkey? What? lt's just monkey business. Monkey business or not. He's not worthy of you. Am l not prettier than her? You? You're as pretty as an angel. ls that what matters to you? You know how many beautiful girls there were in Poland? What good did it do them? My heart's burning, Avrahamiko. Why, Malka? -l can't explain what l have in my heart. l can't. You know how he made his way in here? My father of blessed memory had a little shop in the Old City. He'd tailor fancy suits for men. l'd bring him lunch every day. One day l entered the shop and saw him measuring a suit on a tall man... So handsome, my heart melted. l was so nervous, l dropped all the food. l was so embarrassed... He gave me this look... From that moment he entered my heart. He was European looking, like a movie star. What did you do? What did l not do? l drove my father crazy asking him to set me up with him, to talk to his parents. Father objected, the whole family objected. He's not one of ours, they said. And you... Persisted and got your way. You bet. Everyone was jealous when they saw me with him. And l was barely 17. l got the most handsome knight of all. l was like a queen. Like a queen... He entered my heart and will never leave. l love him. What's this? l'll make you a queen. Honestly. Avraham... l've always been a queen. And always will be. Micha, go see who's at the door. l don't want a whore in my house. Take this... and leave us alone. My husband's expensive, huh? My heart can't be bought with whores' money. Take your filth and get the hell out of here. He won't come back to you. He's mine now. You old whore. He can give you many bastards but his heart will remain here, to the grave. Go get one of your father's shirts from the closet. Wow, look at that... Wow, it's huge, God... Look at that... You have to take... pork fat... put it on the doorstep of the womanizer. The cheater will step on it, he'll be relieved of all his impurity and it will go into the pork. And all the while, read Psalms and God willing, this will all end well. Read Psalms... Read Psalms... What do you mean, pork? Pork, pork... Where can l get pork? - You can get it... l'll get you some... Gedalya, where're ltzik and Micha? They just left with Avraham. Malka, l'm glad you came... What's wrong, Malka? Look, we're watching... lt's a new TV. No, thanks. l need to talk to Micha for a minute. Let Micha watch with us, please... -Come here. l need him... Malka... Micha, darling, you know where Dad is, right? l need you to take this. Put it on his doorstep. Take it. lt's important. Put it on his doorstep, Ok? Go. Go, sweetie, go. Go, my big boy. Go, for your mother, go. Enough! Enough, Mom! Enough!
