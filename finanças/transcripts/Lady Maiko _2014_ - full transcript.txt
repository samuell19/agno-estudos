I am asking where is the new Maiko from? I am Chiba-ku you are asking the wrong person, she is just replying you honestly I am asking which household is she from, she only replied I am Chiba-ku Chiba people should reply "I am from Chiba“ can't you just say Chiba since you replied Chiba, you shouldn't say ku can't stand a Maiko replying "I am Chiba-ku" furthermore, there's one from Nagoya I am Nagoya-ku did she reply like that I am Nagoya-ku no I mean people from Nagoya must reply this way I have no idea if you are a linguist or not, please stop sprouting nonsense she is a part timer is that right, what's happening? I am sure you'll know if a Maiko is starting out in the profession that's true, but why are there part timers it's to advertise Shimoji the People's Association held a party at a hotel for foreign travel groups seems to be the case, their next step was to attract overseas tourist at that point in time, there was only Momoharu as a Maiko the People's Association hired part timers they were hired for the festivities too, but they are not allowed at the banquet Thank you are you disguising as a Maiko no I am a real Maiko you must be kidding, you are so old how can you say I am kidding, that's demoralising you are really well informed, no wonder you are from Italy tourism board why are you without make up because I have make-up on for 12 years come on really? That's about right, must be like a monster everyday been a Maiko for 12 years, that's a real monster Mario she is a monster are you a monster if I become a geisha, Shimoji will be without a Maiko, can't be helped but if Kodaka find a real Maiko, not a part timer I can finally become a geisha the job I have to do... oh pain no need for a real Maiko, just use a part timer from my clan I told the association that or we just recruit online and train them all into full time Maikos this way you can be a geisha please enjoy from what I see, Maiko is like an idol idol's that old men can see that's why they do not need to be professionals treat young and ignorant pretty little things as entertainment that will keep the old men happy, that is what the Maikos are playing at bear with it Momoharu, as a tea-house association its a headache to lose their only Maiko if you think about it, Momoharu has worked hard for Shimoji is the saviour of Shimoji solemn and wholeheartedly trained as a Maiko that's correct, solemn and wholeheartedly trained as a Maiko is the "onigawara" performance starting come it's finally here are you seeing this are you seeing this city of Nagoya, at the top of a 50m platform gold onigawara, onigawara exposed in the rain Mario is this the world famous "onigawara" good evening it is late who is this Who is this can, can, can you teach me how to be a Maiko are you from Kagoshima I mean do you want to be a Maiko Who recommended you we don't accept total strangers please, I want to be a Maiko Tsugaru dialect you come here in the night I can't possibly just reply "oh okay" please return miss Momoharu do you know her?

Furthermore, no recommendation and I don't know her, not sure if I can get train her It has always been my dream dream dream my dream the unfamiliar world spells fear the unknown world spells excitement open the door and see the wind colors of the wind, colors of my heart for sure one day for sure one day Please I want to be a Maiko, it is a must a mixture of dialect from Kagoshima and Tsugaru this is the first time I've ever heard that you must have grown up shuffling between Kagoshima and Tsugaru or one parent speak in Kagoshima dialect, while the other speak in Tsugaru dialect and they are very good at speaking it is that correct you just spoke in the Tokyo dialect my grandma is from Kagoshima, while grandpa is from Tsugaru I grew up with them I resided in Kagoshima for 10 years before living in Tsugaru for 6 years I don't want to know, Momoharu, this is your responsibility now it's late, find her a motel since you want to be a Maiko, you must be considerate of others go home tomorrow Being considerate? That means please don't come again, do you know how to be considerate stand up, I'll send you to the motel now please don't drag this out mom will be angry stand up ain't your feet numb You poor thing since you pity her, you can fulfill her wish I can't do that its just that she wants to be a Maiko, but she can't, its a pity its impossible with that accent is it only her accent? The reason she can't be a Maiko is only because of her accent? Not only that, we don't know her lineage, the accent is the worst of it if you don't try, you won't know professor you are asking for a lot, you think she can be a Maiko? What will you do if she succeeds of course I'll be very shock, but she won't succeed is there a prize if you are shock? That's boisterous, alright how about this, whenever you come to the tea-house, I'll foot the bill if a university professor is always treated like a cockroach, that's just sad alright its fix, now we have to leave it up to the boss what do you mean leave it up to me boss just try it make him spit out his funds for his funeral I don't wish to die yet what are you talking about the two of us are going to train a real Maiko are you for real if this fails, you are not allowed to set foot in Shimoji and stop talking in that half arse Kyoto dialect Ohh, it must be tiresome to come from afar have a drink to warm you up This is our special turbid liquor, its fantastic I have no way of dealing with Haruko if she act spoilt that child it really scares me that all the buffoons want to go to Kyoto to be a Maiko please, I want to be Maiko... So sorry, it might be too cold, the battery is out its fine, I have listen enough this is great so the child who knows Kagoshima and Tsugaru dialect talks like this please take a look, below is the standard waveform of Kyoto dialect this is set, so if you speak Kyoto dialect correctly it will be smooth this is the saw tooth wave form, or there's ranges on the music lines this is due to speaking in a different language it really can be done? Of course it must be done if there's no new Maiko, you will lose your job too right furthermore there are no better samples I will teach her the Kyoto dialect, we just need half a year really? Whether or not I can be a geisha will depend on her I still feel we should find a more reliable person I don't even know we can find another without blogging to make an impossible possible is the greatest challenge of all I feel like this has became a huge undertaking oh yea, how is her family background her parents died in a traffic accident when she was young her grandparents adopted her her grandfather is from Tsugaru, he stayed in Kagoshima with her grandmothers family and for some reason they are now in Tsugaru what's the reason unclear that's fine, when is she coming as for that, she says she needs to go back to talk to her boss don't let her go back, it will be hopeless once she goes back ain't that right Momoharu quite right... Get her to come back Ahito wondrous spring fragrance in the cool summer, the resounding mountain bell can be heard throughout the capital please look out for me thank you please look out for me too pick up the fan, under the bright sunlight beautiful Maiko turning into a flower beautiful Maiko will be in full bloom tomorrow the flowers that I held close to my bosom This time round please listen to us please, thank you very much.

The head of my family is here, I need to leave Alright we will be meeting for the first time to organise a succession celebration we met at the organising meeting its her turn what's this, so lonely the wounded heart is not calm pretending to be the pain of the body I thought you are well loved by everyone but is a person who will never give up Sorry to bother you sister thank you It is this feeling that nobody knows tightly bonding two people together to put it simply it's a red thread don't you know Why is the thread red, red like the fire why is the thread red, like when you get hurt and bleed blood red look at the entanglement and the entwinement almost can't breathe if we can continue to be together ba paya ba paya ba paya paya paya I will be the one to dye the thread red but you are still clueless Sister you're really naughty you say you don't want to be alone with Kodaka you got mom to take Haruko out with her but you never thought you will need to come here Anyway, I just want to see myself as Ono, a beautiful girl, and Xiao Gao is a major general in Fukakusa there's even an Italian restaurant takeaway service here very classy this is not Rikunaga's plot this is Momoharu's plot right? What do you mean plot, you made it sound so devious you are really nonsensical all this is done for Haruko it's a Kyoto dialect examination you can't only talk to the professor, you'll have to talk to maybe others eventually but you are doing this behind the professor's back it will be fine we will let the professor listen to the recording right after is the microphone working speak into it don't be nervous thank you, I am very sorry, please look out for me one more time, just slower thank you, I am very sorry, please look out for me that's a beautiful room come come come please this way Akasei come in hows everything hey hey very welcome thank you for stopping by thank you sister Rikunaga oh Who is this where have I seen her before I am Haruko an apprentice at the "Longevity Song" she is a native of Kyoto you must be here today for the Maiko training yes please do take care of me oh right you must give it your best effort thank you Thank you your hospitality is top notch that's amazing, worthy to be a geisha from Shimoji thank you we the "Kannonin" it's because of the love story of General Fukakusa for miss Ono-no-Komachi that we got this stage named “legend of the white night” having a date in such a classy place here? This is exhilarating cheers miss Ono-no-Komachi did not care for the courtship of the General but still she made him a promise if he can visit her at Kannonin for 100 consecutive days she will accept his love and his reply was, "if miss Ono-no-Komachi will accept me, I will come regardless" thereafter, we saw him here daily every night but on the 99th day General Fukakusa was found dead in the snowy night on the way here the poor thing hey hey what do you mean by this? What are you talking about? I've never heard of this story before it's understandable since Haruko is a local that's why she knows the local story well so miss Ono-no-Komachi resides here before that seems to be the case hey I've visited for quite a number of time right? Definitely not less then 100 times didn't we agree to go to Italy together? When I propositioned the idea, you even thanked me is that right? That did happened, but we didn't exactly planned anything Ti amo ti amo I would like to show you the sparkling waters of Amalfi pulsating sounds of the La Scala opera house I've only heard of the Minamiza kabuki theatre ti amo ti amo I would like to take long walks with you at the Neptune's fountain then shop at Via Dei Condotti didn't you say you dislike crowded places? Isn't that place akin to living right beside the sun? I hate strong sunlight let the heartfelt warmth of our rendezvous be the start of our future endless praise to Italy but we must be careful pain, pain, pain spaghetti with buttered grilled shrimp but his plans are doomed to amount to nothing ti amo ti amo what are you guys doing? Miss Ono-no-Komachi did not care for the courtship of the General but still she made him a promise if he can visit her at Kannonin for 100 consecutive days she will accept his love and his reply was, "if miss Ono-no-Komachi will accept me, I will come regardless" thereafter, we saw him here daily every night but on the 99th day General Fukakusa was found dead in the snowy night on the way here what are you guys doing? What are you doing, stop at this instance you must say it in this manner What do you think a real Maiko is like? A Kyoto native who knows and adhere to the tradition and dances well who can speak in the Kyoto dialect beautifully the Maikos in the long foregone past are already performing on big stages at age 12, 13 they are the children of geishas and teahouse employees there were even some who travel a long way to be sold into the trade due to poverty they grew up using the Kyoto dialect daily and they have to perform on stages so they are practically Kyoto natives even so they are not as arrogant as the Maikos nowadays basically a Maiko is an apprentice geisha on top of that they are very young their maturity are comparable to kids of age 17, 18 now, even so they are still kids though I don't know if this is the reason but half arsed Maikos are more sought after then the geishas they are practically idols I am really confused whoever is actually the real deal Teacher is very disappointed with me he is very angry why do you want to be a Maiko? To be able to wear beautiful kimonos and don make up to look pretty everyday are these you dreams? Though your teacher and I are both teaching you the Kyoto dialect maybe it might be odd to out it this way but no matter if you are a Maiko or a geisha basically the job revolves around entertaining clients at the banquet table you may call it a Kyoto culture or tradition but that is just to portray the profession in the best light possible it is also a tool to enhance the business it is an enterprise grinding for cash if I am to put it plainly, I don't really like this profession neither do I feel that this line of work suits a girl like yourself Your teacher is actually not teaching you the Kyoto dialect solely on your account she wants to train you successfully to become a full-fledged Maiko so that people in the Hanamachi acknowledged her ability your teacher is using you to further herself this way It's raining outside Haruko, take an umbrella to your sister don't forget the high clogs too yes what umbrella is this? How can this be if use? So sorry you should say I am sorry, isn't it? I will fetch another immediately don't forget to bring the high clogs too When will you be able to finish this kind of minuscule task perfectly? It is not an exceptionally hard task this is not the first time you made that mistake and you will speak in your native tongue when you are under stress too lets just call it a day you are totally not paying any attention apologise quickly retire early, and have a good and fresh start tomorrow What is it? How are you why? What's happening? You can't even utter a sound? It's been 3 days and there not even a sound from you it's that bad? Not even a sound? Yips isn't it? Yips? Just like a golfer being fearful of taking a swing this is a serious case of the Kyoto dialect yips the teacher has always been very stern when correcting their manner of speech that resulted in the fear of speaking eventually she will become a mute are you serious? I am not joking oh the poor child is there anyway we can help? We can try setting her up in a place where there's absolute peace and quiet just let her relax for the moment after all, even if you know the cause is yips there is no know way to treat it teacher you are helpless in this situation too right? Can you train me to be a Maiko? Kagoshima? Haruko, can she speak yet? Not only the Kyoto dialect she can't even utter a word of her own original dialect either this is all my fault I told her that she is not fit to be a Maiko you can say that again teacher you are not helping her you are just helping yourself What is happening? Haruko the teacher is here to see you she seems to want to speak with you I thought you wouldn't see me, thank you truth be told I really hope that you can train to be a Maiko I once had the same problem with your accent as you do I travelled from Kagoshima to Tokyo, to study linguistics in the university I did spend an immense amount of effort to correct my accent I travelled to many places to study their native dialects too that resulted in my hometown accent coming out off Mr Akihira told me it might be his fault that you are in this situation by saying that you are not fit to be a Maiko by saying that he dislike Maikos and geishas he said it like that right? Though Akihira speak with a perfect Kyoto accent actually he is a kid from the Nishino teahouse family his mother was a geisha she had him out of wedlock with a local diplomat that means he is an illegitimate child, his mother is the mistress of the diplomat you know the meaning of a mistress right as a boy born in a teahouse tongues will wag if you are still living there once you are all grown up and so most of the illegitimate children will be fostered out when they were young Akihira was brought up by his grandmother though I am not a native, I really do love Kyoto no matter if it's the teahouses , geishas or the Maikos I do feel that the Kyoto culture is wonderful indeed, as Akihira had mentioned I am doing this to prove myself that's why I am teaching you the Kyoto dialect if by doing so I have hurt you, I apologise very sorry otherwise, I really do like you as a person I did give my utmost effort in teaching you that is the truth Can I come in? Come have some snacks There's no need to force yourself getting criticised every time for using you own dialect it must have been an immense pressure you have been training hard since April it must have been tiring we can put that on hold for a bit have some snacks Do you have someone you like? When I was a Maiko, I have someone I really like but I couldn't get married to him that's the problem with this profession holding matchmaking events are common in this profession the clients will request the proprietor to gather all the Maikos and be match-made with the Maiko he likes I pray to the gods everytime in hope that the clients would not choose me all of us slept in bunkbeds in the past the girls will entertain and perform for the guests through the night the clients will stay over when it's very late mother will always lecture us "please be mindful everyone, don't do anything shameful" she even tie the hem of our kimono tightly around our ankles thinking back, it had been a long learning process, it was fun I met my first love when we were sleeping side by side on the bunkbeds, he was a movie star My heart flutters just by looking at his face I was rendered speechless But I see him whenever I close or open my eyes there was once, when my performance ended I was on a night flight named "moonlight" moonlight, fly me far away moonlight, my heart full of emotions the flight took off early there were countless stars in the night sky it's like they were singing out my hopes and dreams the wings of my heart took flight please follow me, moonlight we reach Haneda airport in the middle of the night he was waiting for me at the lobby of my hotel even though we didn't speak much we felt true happiness just by being together blue sky I pray you can wait blue sky the coming of dawn please preserve the memories when the first light comes, the beautiful stars will disappear don't allow the sunlight take away my love I will not be able to reach you, even if my heart have wings I only hope I can preserve this sliver of moonlight I only hope I can preserve this sliver of moonlight I am so lonely I had to do my daily lessons everyday once I am back and it was in the daily repetitions of practise which ended my first love And now I have risen from Maiko to geisha status with earning power I am be considered an independent competent woman I can finally be responsible and do things for myself and marry the person I really like and even leave this city I can continue to perform my geisha duties and dedicate my life to this artform too there was a Maiko older then Rikunaga by 1 named Ichunji coming to think of it Ichunji lived here I started training her when she was very young though I hoped I can continue to train her, it wasn't for me to decide I got married and left then she would often visit me when she was on a break Momoharu was still a baby then she really dotes on Momoharu she was like a sister to me but when her contract nearly ended she betrayed the man she was betrothed to and eloped with a married man she did asked me for advise on this it was me who told her to elope if she really wish to coming to think of it, that was really a bad idea after that because of this incident and other minor incidents the proprietor of this teahouse who is actually my mother ran into huge debts the teahouse had to close down who would have thought that after mother close the teahouse she would request me to work as a geisha again in hope that I can continue the family business the teahouse had through the family for a number of generations after all and there was a lot of people begging me to return too after pondering for a long time I finally took Momoharu with me and return I fought long and hard after that after that incident with Ichiji it would be hard to tell my child that snatching another woman's husband is wrong and times have changed too so the teahouse I want to create will train the girls to be self reliant and live independently but it's easier said then done I was only able to train a few who fit the description of independent and self reliant just when I thought the business was on it's last leg you appear do you like to dance? Of course I would not force you on it do you want to try it out tomorrow at the studio? I gave a notice to the teacher that you are unable to speak Are you going for practice? Can I have a talk with you? I am not here to lecture you though everyone have been nice to you but I do need to tell you listen now we are in the business of taking money and fulfilling the clients dream it doesn't matter if it's the Kyoto dialect or dancing you'll need to learn all of them to achieve your goal the current you needs to train hard to be a top notched Maiko if you ever encounter any problems in the future don't think everyone will always help you you'll need to walk your own path I was born in Tokyo I spent every ounce of effort and travel here to learn the local dialect and diligently honed my skills to this day as for you what are your thoughts when you cross that bridge? Isn't your hand gesture wrong? It should be your right feet why are you still turning the opposite way you must face forward, your bum must be lowered don't tilt upwards what is happening? Did you put your heart into it? Don't think after a few talks you will be allowed to dance here without putting in effort you think too much of yourself enough you can stop now Speaking Hope I can see you in my dreams close my eyes and wish you a goodnight my body is totally drained forget everything and wish you a goodnight Hope I can see you in my dreams close my eyes and wish you a goodnight my body is totally drained forget everything and wish you a goodnight everytime when the night ends the melody of sadness continues but as the constellation changes even if there's tears in my tears when we meet again I will whisper to you softly the gratitude in my heart being thankful, I wish you a goodnight Good morning Tsuruichi sister morning are you feeling better? Yes thank you sister that's great thank you Can you stand the hardship? I can Regarding your situation I can't decide alone though it's such, but I will turn 30 in 12 months the netizens are laughing at me net? Is it email? No its the Internet they said "a geisha in your 30s should just get through with your life and be done" if its a Maiko isn't it even more shameful to be a Maiko at 30 if I can't be a geisha before 30 I will quit the profession You can practise on your own alright, after the performance you need to perform once for sister Rikunaga alright you have been hardworking thank you Thank you for your effort I will be a happy geisha soon cool beautiful sexy mature and finally free take off your footwear and dance geisha status will allow the woman to be self reliant I dreamt I was performing the "blackened hair" dance geisha status will allow the woman to be self reliant Sister, all your teeth are black you have to do this before becoming a geisha We will not train in Kyoto dialect today we will read lines from the book read the book slow and precise Are you ready? Lets start The last geisha from a servant girl to an apprentice before I amount to anything I need to bear all hardships it will definitely be hard speaking correctly according to tradition and the correct dance techniques and posture the moon shines on the foggy eastern mountain bonfires lit the mountains every night that's right, your back must be straight your bum must be lowered further if there's any error, there will be a lecture the master seldom allow anyone to rest they are all just girls of 12 to 13 all of them had cried countless times Cup boy faster too far sorry just like this just like that looks like that how does it look like?

Look at how everything is nice and dandy now mother and sister have been very good to me is that right? How about when dancing? I love to dance alright, then dance for me go perform a dance for everyone yes It seems enough effort had been made thank you thank you Thank you everyone it almost feels like the first time I see Koharu dance I wonder what's happening to me there's a feeling of deja vu seeing Koharu dance is it? That's right don't you remember? There was a kid that looks like her in our house who is it? Is it someone I know? It might be someone I don't know you should know why do you think I want to be the one to send her off? Stop it, just tell me my dear lovely sister we competed to see who can sit straight the longest she hates vegetable in sauce don't you tell me... She the one I sent off Koharu? That's right they really look alike now that you mentioned it it's as if shes her double never knew someone can be so similar to another the relationship between those two can't be easily explained this child was sweeping the floor at the entrance when we first met and I automatically thought of her is your mother Ichunji? No way That is correct my mother is Ichunji oh my god the one who eloped with the chef from Kagoshima? That's why, you had been speaking in the Kagoshima dialect I never imagine the daughter of Ichunji will debut as a Maiko teacher, is it because of this that you took her under your wing? I didn't know when I started after the boss decided to send her over she confessed to me, it was quite a shocker mother, sister Rikunaga do you know my mother is Ichunji? Yes everybody was really friendly with your mother Excuse me, can I take a photograph? Thank you are you preparing for an event? That's cute Please enter can I have a moment? Haruko... I am Koharu you should've attended my debut performance haven't I mentioned before I dislike the Maiko, geisha profession and this city? But I like this city I'll like to continue living here just like my mom before you are born here brother, actually you love it here right? Otherwise why would you study the Kyoto dialect that's because as a native it will be to my advantage to learn it that's why teacher depended on me, and it's easier applying for the position too is it? But I want to listen to your Kyoto dialect its much more interesting to listen to the teacher speak the Edo dialect he is a purebred Edo native after all isn't the teacher from Kagoshima? Of course not, he is from Tokyo but he spoke to you in perfect Kagoshima dialect he can converse every well right? It doesn't stop at the Kagoshima dialect he knows dialects from all over Japan Oh its you the school is now bustling with activity, there's talk about a new Maiko can I ask if your hometown is in Kagoshima? Er... that actually its Tokyo actually I was hoping to be able to encourage you that one time so I spoke in the Kagoshima dialect I apologise I don't have any bad intentions What's happening? You have no voice? Oh my god it's all my fault it's not my intention is mislead you hows that? You are obviously trying to mislead her. You talk in the Kagoshima dialect, and so she thought you are a native isn't that trying to mislead her? Come on how can we help? She has lost her voice again what can be done here Akihira? Okay how can we deal with this stop it teacher, what are we going to do? What are we going to do? This is really bad you've been had thank you sorry do look out for me in the coming future coming to think of it, Mr cockroach Mr cockroach?, what do you mean? Does it mean "swindler"? Err that... Actually Mr cockroach is the nickname given to him by the young master he always sneak in the teahouse kitchen and drink there while watching the Maikos and geishas move in and out of the kitchen it means he is drinking without paying we only joked about it to protect his reputation as a linguistics researcher he acts like a cockroach to do in-depth research on the dialect of people in the Hanamachi districts thank you for the explanation Ever since Haruko came to Shimoji its been one year though she is still the only Maiko but the turnout for "oni" is exceptionally well seems like someone is watching Wonderous spring fragrance in the cool summer, the resounding mountain bell can be heard throughout the capital please look out for me thank you please look out for me too pick up the fan, under the bright sunlight beautiful Maiko turning into a flower beautiful Maiko will be in full bloom tomorrow the flowers that I held close to my bosom Koharu do you know what's most important to a Maiko? What's that? Its youth it not the age of youth that everyone speaks of it is the effort made to retain your youthful self only this way, the clients then can relive their youth I notice this while observing you it doesn't matter where you are born as long as you are willing to put in the effort, you will become a real Maiko and so, Koharu you are the real deal has always been thank you that means I have fulfilled my obligations as a teacher that's right that means I don't have to continue to be Mr cockroach that's right thank you I am very sorry please look out foe me train your craft and soul beautiful Maiko turning into a flower beautiful Maiko will be in full bloom tomorrow the flowers that I held close to my bosom beautiful Maiko I do like the teacher after all --subtitles courtesy of nutcase21--
