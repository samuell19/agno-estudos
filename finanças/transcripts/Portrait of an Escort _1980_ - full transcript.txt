Then just before we come, put a pot on the stove to boil, Sprinkle cinnamon, and cover. It will smell like you're cooking something wonderful. People buy homes, not houses, so try to create the atmosphere of a home. Jordan, dear, come here. Can you believe it? The lady has a bid in on a half million dollar house, and now she wants to hold up everything Till she's sure the kitchen sink is stainless. The owners are in Spain. Jordan, would you run over and check the sink after work tonight? Well, I can't work tonight. Why? Have an emergency? No, I have a 13-year-old daughter. Don't we all have children? Well, it's just that between working late and going to school at night, I never see her. All right. I'll call my client back and tell her that the sink is stainless. When she moves in and it's enamel, we'll replace it out of your salary. I was hoping you'd understand. I understand. Fully. Yeah, I know. Now listen to me. That is not your job. It's not your responsibility, so don't you pay any attention to her. Don't you let her bully you. She's just a user. Hey, listen, I'm gonna go shopping tonight. You want to come? No, can't take the time away from Jess. So bring her along. You could both use some new clothes. That's true, but no money. Jordan, take it out of your child support. What? What child support? My ex calls me to borrow money, collect. Oh. Have you ever wondered why you and I have the same job and we make the same slave wages and I've got money and you don't? Well, there's two of me, for starters. I have a second job. - You work nights? - Some. You interested? No, then I’d never see Jess. Okay. What do you do? Date. You date? Date. You mean, date, date? Yeah. I work for an escort service. I make 30, 40 bucks a shot. - For an escort service? - Yeah. There are guys around who will pay to go out with a girl. I don't try to figure them out. Listen, I've got a great idea. Why don't you meet me tomorrow morning before work and I'll introduce you to my escort agent? I could never do something like that. Why? What have you got to lose? My innocence. ♪ So I guess it's all right to be here ♪ working in la ♪ just to catch a glimpse of tomorrow ♪ it's worth another day ♪ Hi. Hi, mom. How was your day? Really good. Really good, huh? I went to the park after school. And I met someone. He's the neatest guy. I jogged with him, and we talked for almost an hour. Uh-huh? Tell me. Well, he's good-looking. He's nice. He looked like he needed a shave though. A shave? How old is this guy? About your age. My age? Jessica, promise me you'll have nothing further to do with this man. Why? Don't ask. Just promise me, please. Mom, he's not a child molester. Don't... don't say that. Don't even think it. You just give me your word. Promise. Okay. Well, say it. Say, "I promise." Okay, I promise. Okay. What are we having for dinner? Macaroni and cheese. Oh. You're late. What happened? Well, I was up all night with Jess. She had a case of the 24-hour flu or some kind of temper tantrum. I don't know. Anyway, she's okay, but I kept her home. Listen, I want to forget the whole thing, okay? What? Well, the way I look, who'd go out with me anyway? Come on. Somebody's bound to notice your inner beauty. Come on. It's gonna be okay. I promise. We're always happy to find new girls. I lose so many. They go on to... Oh, cream or sugar? Oh, nothing, thank you. They go on to other things. Well, professional dating works like this. A man calls my office. Oh, I'm listed in the urban yellow pages in six surrounding communities. Now, let's say that this man is in town on business and he wants a young woman's company for a function or maybe just a pleasant evening out. Well, I ask him what he's looking for, and he tells me. Short or tall, thin or rounded, blonde or brunette. Uh, does he ask if she's intelligent? Intelligence is usually beyond the point of what a man is looking for in a date. Now, let's say that you fit the description. I give him your number. He calls you, and you both work out the details. The fee is $50. Half is yours and half is mine. Oh, the girls tell me they often get a tip. I'm sorry. I just don't understand why a man would pay $50 for a simple date. Oh, but my gentlemen are professionals and businessmen for the most part. Usually they just don't even know anyone in a strange town to ask out. Or maybe they're somebody who's just tired of their little circle of acquaintances. Now, just fill out this form. Oh, and one more thing. I run a legitimate business. What happens between you and your date past the dating fee is no concern of mine. I just want you to be discreet. Mrs. Kennedy, I'm really going to have to think this over. Well, you do that, honey. We'll be in touch. Thank you. Hello. Oh, yes, yes. I'll... I will tell her. Thank you very much. That was Emily. She said she can see you For five minutes if you go right now. I've been trying to reach Jess for 20 minutes. There's no answer. Well, honey, if she was up all night sick, she's probably in a deep sleep. I told the super to go check up on her. He's gonna ring me back. If he calls, hold on to him for me. Hey, good luck. Yes, yes. I'll be there. On time as always. Bye, bye. So, you wanted to see me? Mrs. Amend, I need a raise. I'm sorry. We don't give our office girls raises. You're too replaceable. Anyway, what good is 25 cents an hour? Would $40 a month before taxes really solve your problems? Well, it would be a start. You just concentrate on getting your license. Before you know it, you're gonna be making big, fat commissions. But not soon enough. You see, I'm behind on my rent and my car is falling apart and my daughter needs braces. Oh, I know. But stretch it. You girls always seem to find a way. Sorry, dear, I really must run. No raise? No raise. Hello. Thanks. What are you doing? Wait a minute. Where are you going? She's not there. Jordan, you can't just walk right... Jessica! That's Beau, who I was telling you about. I don't want to hear anything. Just get in the car, and I don't want to hear one word. Well, I felt better, so I figured I'd just... Not one word! Now you're going to tell me why you broke your promise to me. I didn't promise. Well, not really. My fingers were crossed. Then you tricked me. I'm sorry, but you wouldn't listen. You just jumped to your own conclusions. I jumped to your protection. We never have any fun anymore. You're not the same mother you used to be. Jess! Well, it's true. I don't understand what's the matter with you lately. The matter with me is... I work all day at a job That can't even keep us in this dump we live in. I owe everybody money that I don't have and I keep getting farther behind. I come home to this place cross and exhausted, and I have to leave you alone when you're sick. The trouble with me is I can't do anything right. Oh, mom, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Hello. Mrs. West. A gentleman just called and asked for a girl exactly like you. May I give him your number? Um... Yes. Jessie! Jessie, how do I look? This dress used to fit me. At least I thought it did. Maybe it never did. You look beautiful. It's not too bare? I guess I'll wear my sweater. You're a little nervous though. Yes, I guess so. What are you doing in your work? Well, I'm a social worker. I provide companionship and attention and intelligent conversation to people who need it. That's nice. Old people? No, not terribly old. Well, if you ever need any help, I'm really good at talking to people. Cheering them up. Yeah, you sure are. But you don't have to worry about bringing home the bacon yet. You can leave that to me. You just go off to Mandy's, okay? Okay. Good luck at work. - Thanks. - Bye. Bye. See you later. Hello? Sandy, help. Jordan? What's wrong? I don't know how to do this. What do I say? Okay, it's very simple. Now the first thing you do Is you make sure you get the fee right up front. Just be very charming about it. Say something like, "why don't we take care of the fee "And get that out of the way?" And make sure it's cash. Out of town checks have a way of bouncing. And don't take any credit cards. Very funny. And just relax and enjoy yourself. Order the most expensive thing on the menu. Sandy... Then at the end of the date, you remind him it's tip time. You say something like, "I hope this has been a very nice evening for you. "I've tried to make it one." Yuck! Well, that's reality, my friend. What you say and how you say it can make the difference between a $25 and a $50 evening. But just do it your way. I'm sure you're gonna be fine. Just let me know how it all goes, okay? Okay. Yeah. Bye. Oh... - Jordan west? - Yes. I'm Loren. - Hi. How are you? - Hi. Oh, I have a table reserved for us. Show me. Oh, yeah. Excuse me. Would you like a drink? Yes, thank you. Waitress. Yes, what can I get you? I'll have a gin fizz, please. Okay. Sir? Oh, I'll have the same. Whiskey double. Okay. Gin fizz... That's a lady's drink. - You a lady? - I hope so. Are you a gentleman? That depends. Maybe we should take care of the fee And get that out of the way. Oh, yeah. Is that right? Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, that's all right. That's... That's all right. That's all right. - Whoops! - I'm sorry. I really am. Oh, please. Accidents happen. Don't worry about it. It's all right. I got it. I'll get your drinks in a minute. I got it. Listen, why don't you just send them up to my room, please. Oh, no, no. Right here is fine. Thank you. Sure. You are a lady. Or is it just me? You? I don't even know you. Oh, it's all right. Go ahead and be honest. I mean, it's me. Isn't it? I mean, if I hadn't paid you that, You wouldn't be out with me. Right? Hello? Hello, Sandy. I woke you, didn't I? Jordan? No, no. What's wrong? Nothing. I just wanted to tell you how it went. How it went? Oh, oh, the date. Right. How did it go? Not so good. You know, I told Jess I was doing social work, and that's exactly what I did. The guy's wife cheated on him, Then she left him, then he lost his job... I offered him his money back. - You didn't. - Yeah. But he wouldn't take it. Well, thank god. Listen, I've got a friend over. Oh, I'm sorry. You didn't say anything. No, it's okay. It's okay. Well, I'll let you go. Okay. I'll tell you what. We'll talk about it tomorrow. You can tell me all about it. Okay. Bye. Bye. Jess, would you get that? Hello? Hello? Who is it? It was a hang up. Let's do something today. Let's go some place. Social work must be fun. How about miniature golf or a movie? Don't those cost too much? Cost is no object, my dear. I'll get it. Well, put on a robe. Who is it? Beau. Remember me? - Hi! - Hiya. How are you today? Okay. Who is it, Jess? It's me, Beau Simpson. And I'm clean, except for a couple of parking tickets and a bad turn on the Brooklyn bridge. I got a friend that's got some horses over at Griffith park And Jess said she'd like to learn to ride, so... That's what I want to do today. Could I, mom? Please. We were going to do something together. Couldn't we all do something? Together? Please? Dime for your thoughts. Inflation. A dollar would be more like it. Oh, classy thoughts. How do you spell "Beau"? Beau. B-e-a-u. Beau. French. Oui, Oui. French. It fit what my mother had in mind for me. You know, "Beau goes to the opera. "Beau goes to the ballet." I was a big disappointment. Oh, your mother sounds pretty fancy. Uh-uh, very fancy. Very. Unfortunately, I'm not. You dress okay though. Those are pretty nice boots you have on. Yeah, well... How'd you meet Jess? Well, it's not what you thought. I'm not am not the park prevert. I'm an actor. And I was in the park working out and I... I saw her. She was being hassled by a couple of high school kids trying to play games. She didn't tell me that. No? Well, anyway, I told them I was her old man, and after that they left her alone. Then she wouldn't leave me alone. She doesn't have a father. No? Well, rather she does, But he sees her about as often as we go to the moon. Hmm. That's too bad. I guess the guy doesn't know what he's missing. She's a great kid. Thanks. I think so, too. I'm sorry I was so rude. It's okay. Really. All right. This is a horse. I know it's a horse. How do you know that? - I've seen pictures. - Good. All right. Now, to ride a horse, you got to get up on this side. - All right? - Okay. You get up on the other side and the horse sits on you. How's that? Good. All right. Now, you stay still and the horse moves. And that's how you ride a horse. - Okay. - All right. Get going. How come you never taught Jess to ride? What for? Well, for the joy. My childhood was full of joy. I grew up with air like crystal, blue skies, and the smell of the earth being turned. I believed in my favorite mare, the four seasons, and true love forever. Reality came as a big shock. Just being up on a horse reminds me Of the difference between how it was and how it is now. I guess getting divorced and raising a child alone must be pretty tough. How are you doing there, Jess? Pretty good. You look good. Thanks. It's fun. That's the idea. Guess we should have done this a long time ago, huh? Yeah. Hi. Hi. You've been gone all day. Well, I had a lot of stuff to do. Well, we're running late. We really should pay for dinner and drinks tonight - Because the byrnes paid last... - You know, I’d... I'd rather not go tonight, if you don't mind. Beau, is there something wrong? Um, I don't know. Did you talk to your agent today? Oh, I got my obligatory weekly phone call from him yesterday. Nothing? You guessed it. Oh, Beau. Why don't you let me use my connections? Look, let's avoid going through that again, all right? But it just doesn't make any sense. You have to take every advantage that you can. I do. My wardrobe. My entertainment. Unscrupulous. Taking advantage of a poor widow woman. Beau, I enjoy sharing what I have with you. Let's both stay home. Warm up the hot tub and just be together. I'd really rather be alone tonight, if you don't mind. I'm sorry. I hope you'll understand. Of course. I understand. Good. Good night. Hey, hello there. Hello. I was worried what kind of deal I'd get, calling your agency last minute. But looks like I lucked out. Thank you. This is a really nice place. I've never been here before. Oh, I come here all the time. It's nice, expensive, but, hey, I'm a lawyer. A lot of my colleagues come here. So it matters who you're seen with. You got it. Well... Yep. I lucked out. Did I? You better believe it. May I get you drinks? Another scotch rocks, and the lady will have a glass of your house white. Oh, I'd really prefer something else. Hey, you'll love their white. Could we take care of the fee? Let's not. Let's forget the fee. I'm gonna show you a great evening. I really can't do that. You see, my agent gets half of the $50. The lady you spoke with this afternoon. Tell her I didn't show. Tell her the date washed out. How's she gonna know? I really don't do things like that. You're kidding, aren't you? Hey. There's an old law professor of mine. He taught me contracts and tort law. I'll explain tort law to you later. Come on. I want you to meet him. - Professor Lewis. - Yes. Ted Quinn. Ted, how are you? - Don't get up. Don't get up. - Nice to see you. - This is Jordan. - Hi, Jordan. How are you? I'd like you both to meet my wife, Mary-Ellen. It's a pleasure. Ted Quinn, and this is Jordan. Hello. I understand you're an expert in tort law? Well, that's my field. Yes. Perhaps you could settle a contract dispute for me. Oh, I don't think this is the time for business... You see, this man hired me for a date and he refuses to pay. It's really been nice to see you. Yeah, good to see you, Ted. That was uncalled for. Look, I'll pay. I'm willing to pay. You owe me an evening. Sue me. Hello. Hello? Is somebody there? Hello. Ooh. I woke you, huh? Who is this? It's Beau Simpson. I don't usually call at this hour, but... I'm sorry I snapped. It's just that I had a hang up a while ago, and this has been a forgettable evening. Well, do you believe in try, try again? Like maybe tomorrow? Sure. Do you think Jess would mind if it was just the two of us? I don't think so. She's having a friend over. How about something simple, like a picnic on the beach. Okay. Pick you up at 12:00? Okay. Goodbye. Bye. I gather from the way you ride that you're a country boy. Close. I was raised in Manhattan. You're kidding. No. Learned to ride in central park. Well, how'd you get into acting? I always wanted to be the lone ranger. But I took the easy way out And got my teaching credentials instead. Bet you didn't like that. No, no, I liked it. I liked it. It's just that old dreams... Oh, you know, they die hard. They kind of burn a hole in you. So, I decided to give acting a shot. Do you work a lot? Should I recognize you? Well, two lines in two years. I guess it's difficult to make it in the movie business. Yeah. But then, you only have yourself to support. Right? Right. I mean, I've never been married, If that's what you're getting at. I'm... I'm waiting for the perfect girl. - Oh. See you later. - No, no. Come here. It's all right. So you're a romantic, huh? Yes. Well, you know what? I married the perfect guy. Yeah? High school sweetheart, most likely to succeed, the whole thing. Not only wasn't it perfect, it wasn't even good. Fair to middling would be an exaggeration. Do not wait for the perfect girl forever. I won't. Promise. Okay? Well, you're gonna look beautiful now, huh? - Guaranteed. - We need a picture of this. Come on. Let's see a big smile. Big smile. Come on. You can do it. Go ahead. Go ahead. Come on, Jess. Smile. Come on, I see it. It's almost there. Come on. There it is. - I look like a geek, huh? - No, you don't. You look like... Christmas. Hey, what do you say we all go out to dinner tonight? I can't. Mom's working tonight, So she can pay for my braces. Oh. Well, I guess that just leaves the two of us, huh, tin grin? What do you say? - Sure. - Okay. But don't call me "tin grin." Okay. Let's go, flash. How about that? - That's pretty bad, too. - Hop in. - Hang on. - Okay. I've come out here a few times. Let's see... We have of doctors here from all over the world, Probably, for this conference. Come on. Ah, it's the first time I've been out here on the conference circuit, and I was lucky enough to find someone like you To have some fun with. - You're a good dancer. - Thank you. For me? For you. Thank you. Hope you're gonna like it. It's carefully selected, really thought out, and wrapped in such a way that you'll never get it open. Perfume, huh? Oh, it's beautiful. Thank you. Okay. Good. I think I should tell you, Dr. Paige, that on these dates I don't... I don't either. No strings attached. I... you know, I am a widower with a successful private practice, and I do occasionally meet someone On whom I can lavish a bit of my good fortune. And anyway, I'd certainly like to get to know a woman first. Okay? Thank you. Oh, there's a friend. Come on, I have someone I want you to meet. Jordan... Jordan, hi. Hi, Sandy. This is Dr. Ken Paige. This is my friend, Sandy, and uh... Sean Feldon. Also in for the convention. I see. How are you, Dr. Feldon? Yes. - Hello. - Hey, I heard your paper. A very good paper, doctor. Why don't you have a drink with us? Oh, thank you. A drink with the senior man of ophthalmology? I'm honored. What'll you have? The round's on me. Oh, ah, but just one little drink. I want this man loose, not unconscious. We're gonna play hospital later. Waiter. Waitress. Well, I don't know. Maybe at my age, I guess you just start to get to be more philosophical. However, it just seems to me that one part of us wants to be free And the other part of us wants an anchor of some kind. Well, whatever. Thank you for a lovely evening. Thank you. I'd like to invite you in, but... Another time. What was that? Must be a cat. Back east they'd call that a raccoon, probably. Good night. Who is it? Sandra, it's me, Jordan. Hey, hi. What are you doing here? I need to talk to you. Okay. Sure, come on in. New couch? Yeah. It came yesterday. You like it? Sandra, what are you doing with yourself? Do you want some Brandy? I was just going to have some. You're selling yourself now, aren't you? I got these two chairs to go with the couch in rough leather. I think they really look nice, don't you? Aren't you? Get off my case, Jordan! Why, Sandra? Because this is the only way that I can afford to live the way I want to. I'm not talented. I'm not educated. I'm not trained. All I've got to bargain with is me. Period. Well, that's sad. But true. And what, may I ask, other than what they taught us In Sunday school, is wrong with it? This has nothing to do with Sunday school. It's fake. It's phony. I would die before I would let somebody I didn't care about touch me! Much less charge him money for it. Oh. Oh... Baby, you are so naive. And you're becoming so hard. Do you believe there's such a thing as love? Well, I've heard about that. I've read about it. It's just that I haven't seen too much of it. Well, I'm working on it. No kidding? With who? Beau. Oh. Your unemployed actor friend. Yeah? Well, good luck. Work late last night? Hi. Yeah, a little bit. I kept calling, but there was no answer. Well, I... I guess I got home around 11:00. Well, I guess I called before 11:00. I dropped Jess off at her friend's apartment at 8:00. She told me. She had a really good time. Thank you. You always leave her there when you go out at night? Well, only if I think I'm going to be late. Could we start this conversation again. Please. Hi. I came over here with some good news. - What? - I got a job. Oh, great! Acting. In a movie for television. Congratulations. Thanks. It's for a producer who does a lot of product, so... It's a real good beginning. Oh, good. Shall we celebrate? Want some coffee? I thought you'd never ask. Cut! Want to take it again? Hi. What're you doing down here? I'm on my lunch break and thought I'd come and watch. - Is that okay? - Sure. Did I miss your scene? Uh, I'm afraid I missed it. There's an old saying in our business. Bit players never die, they just get written out on the set. I'm sorry. It's okay. I bump you. You always bump me. That's how I beat you every time. Who's your mom out with tonight? With her boyfriend. Which one? She only has one. Beau. But she goes out with lots of guys. No, she doesn't. Then how come we always see her go out all dressed up? She works at night sometimes. That's right. She works. Jess, you can talk to me about it. I'm your best friend. About what? About your mom doing prostitution. What are you talking about? You know what the word means, don't you? Yeah. What's it got to do with my mom? Well, my mom says for sure that's what your mom is up to. Your mom doesn't know what she's talking about, Mandy. She does so. Go home and tell your mom to stuff it, Mandy. How come? Because I said to. Get out! Go on! Okay. But just remember, if you forfeit, I win. Get out! Get out! ♪ Lazy Jessie, will you get up? ♪ Will you get up, will you get up? ♪ Lazy, Jessie, will you get up ♪ so early in the morning ♪ How was your evening? Well, did you lose the game to Mandy? I thought maybe you did. I saw the pieces all over the living room floor. Did you throw them at her? I'm sorry. I forgot to pick them up. What's wrong, Jessie? Nothing. Something's wrong. Your braces. I took 'em off. What for? I don't need braces. Jessie! You do too need braces. You have a bad bite. We're gonna have to have them put right back on. I don't get it, Jessie. I worked very hard to be able to afford these. Yeah, and I know doing what. What? I don't need braces that bad. I don't need anything that bad. You always told me not to lie. Because lies confuse things Between people who love each other. Social work. That's not what Mandy's mom calls it. What does Mandy's mom call it? I wish I were qualified to do something that would pay me as much as professional dating. Maybe when I get my real estate license I will be. And I wish I had the time to speculate about other people's private lives. What's professional dating? Professional dating is what it sounds like. It's a date you get paid for. And a date is all it is. I don't expect you to understand. Just believe that your mother is not doing anything that you have to be ashamed of. Hello. Thank you for picking me up. Good evening. My daughter is having a hard time with this, and I was hoping that meeting somebody like you Would make her feel better. Sure, sure. Fine. Happy to do whatever I can. Thank you. I'll be right back. Jessie, I want you to meet the man Who's taking me out tonight. Do I have to? I'd really like you to. This is Jess. This is Dr. Paige. How do you do? Nice to meet you. Your mother's told me a lot about you. Sure. Can I go now? Are you sure you're gonna be all right alone? I'll be fine. Perhaps you should call Pam or one of your friends, huh? No, I'll be okay. Really. I'm gonna take good care of your mother. Don't you worry. Lock up. I will. Good night. Hello? Hello? Is that you, Mandy? Hello? Here we go. Well, Sichuan's a province, I think, And so is hunan and let's see... Canton's a city. Listen, well, anyway. Sichuan. I recommend it. I think you'd like it. Would you like to try it? Oh, that will be fine. Unless you prefer something else? No, that's fine. I really should give Jess a call. Oh, okay, okay. Don't be too hard on her. She's just jealous of your attention to other people. It's natural. Well, she was rude. I didn't take it personally. Thank you. But I need to call her for me. I don't like to leave her home alone. Okay. Say, shall... Shall I order for you? Sichuan? Uh, I prefer mandarin. I'll wait until you get back. - Hello. - Hi. Who's this? - Jess. - Jess? Is Beau there? No, he's not, but can I take a message? Well, who's this? This is sheilah. I'm a friend of Beau's. Me, too. You don't know when he'll be back, do you? No, he usually has his acting class on Thursdays, But can't I help you? It's kind of hard to explain, but... Beau and my mom are kind of going steady, except that they're not. Because my mom goes out. Like tonight she went out with this really dumb old guy. Anyway, I wanted to tell Beau, Because I think he really likes my mom. And she really... I better wait and tell him myself. It's kind of complicated. Oh, uh, that's all right. No, forget it. Just tell him I called, okay? I will. Thanks. Bye. Bye. Hello? Jessie, I've been trying and trying to reach you. I was about to make an emergency break through. Who on earth have you been talking to anyway? I'm sorry. I need to be able to reach you when I'm out. Please don't stay on the line so long. I won't. Are you locked in? Yes, I'm okay. Sure? I'm fine. Okay. I won't be late, but I want you to take this number In case you need to call me. All right? All right. You have a pencil and paper? Yeah. The number's 555-7658. Okay. 555-7658. Okay, bye, honey. Bye. You got her? Ah, yeah, finally. Thank you. Good. Well, I haven't ordered. Mandarin, hmm? Uh-huh. "Uh-huh"? Mandarin. Why don't I take you home, huh? Let you get things straightened out. Wouldn't that be better? I hate to spoil your evening. It's all right. It's all right. Waiter. Thanks. No, no, no. My practice... My work is certainly still serious, but I don't know. Everyday life seems to me... well, it's gotten kind of casual or superficial And then, you know... Somebody comes along or something happens, And you realize that maybe it doesn't have to be like that. And... Yes, yes, I'm sorry. You know, I nearly forgot this. I appreciate your not asking for this fee. Well, this wasn't really a date. No, no, please, please, please, please. It's not important. But I wanted to ask you, um... Ah, thank you. And thank you for helping me with Jess. You're a nice lady. Are you free? When? No, I don't mean Saturday night. I... Listen, I am older, right? And maybe I'm a little bit sedate, and that could be a drawback to a younger person, but I'm gonna ask you anyway. Hell. Are you free of entangling alliances? I'm not sure. Well, okay. When you are, let me know. Good night. Good night. Hi, mom. Go back to sleep. Good night. Oh! Do you know anyone you'd think might do something like this? Well, it could be the act of a jealous lover. Is there anybody in your life that fits that description right now? - No. - How about at work? No, there's nobody at the office. I do professional dating on the side. You're an escort. You probably know some of the guys down at vice. You got a record? No, this is just something I'm doing temporarily until we get on our feet. Yeah. Yeah, well... Look, lady, this opens up a whole new field, and brings in some of the less savory citizens in our town, so I want you to drop by the precinct with the names of the guys you've dated and the names of the girls who might think that you're trying to rip off some of their business. In the meantime, we'll take care of it. You keep your doors locked and your windows locked. Huh? Good night. Good morning. Good morning. Jess called last night. Who is she? I told you. She's a little girl I've been spending some time with. What'd she want? Just to talk, I guess. What does her mother do? She works in real estate. What's she like? Nice. Well, it seems the little girl was upset because the mother went out with someone That Jess apparently didn't like. Old and rich was the way she described him. Sheilah, would you do me a favor? Why, of course. I need to work. Would you use your connections? Finally. Desperation, I guess. Hello. Jordan! And how is one of my very best girls? I've come to settle up with you. Oh, dear, no. You can't stop now. You're one of my most successful girls. Sorry. You've built your own clientele. Well, it happens all the time. Your friend Sandra, all the girls. But frankly, I didn't spot you as the type. I'm not. It's... it's just that I have a daughter, and I can't stay away from home at night anymore. Well, we shall miss you. You're a popular item. I think this is what I still owe you. Jordan. Can I see you for a moment, please? I'm sorry, Jordan. I'm going to have to let you go. Mrs. Amend, somebody broke into my apartment last night. My daughter and I didn't sleep all night. I had a really important appointment to go to this morning... Jordan, I know that you and Sandra Have been moonlighting for an escort service. How do you know that? There had to be some reason you were always tardy. I received a phone call. I don't know from whom. Obviously not a friend. Mrs. Amend, that doesn't have anything to do with my... Jordan, I have tried to be as tolerant as I could be. I'll try much harder. Jordan, uh-uh. I'm sorry. Good morning. I'm Mrs. Croft. Perhaps you could help me. Well, I know we can help you. Won't you sit down? Well, actually, I'm looking for a young woman who works here. A west. Worked here. Jordan. She doesn't work here now? Not anymore. She's just leaving. The blonde? Too bad. She could have made an honest, respectable living in real estate. Instead, she chose to get mixed up in one of those situations. What situation? Escort dating. I'm surprised. Why didn't you tell me last night? What could you have done? I could have been here. I could have stayed with you. I don't like getting this kind of news 12 hours late, like yesterday's weather report. I'm sorry. Did Jess tell you she called my place last night? No, she didn't. Well, she said you were out with some guy. Old and rich. Just a paying date. A what? I work for an escort service at night. I get paid to date. I don't believe it. Well... What else am I supposed to do? Nobody ever told me, "Jordan, when you grow up, you should be prepared. "Get ready to take care of yourself and your kid." I grew up believing in marry your true love and everything will take care of itself. Only I married a man who couldn't take care of a pet parakeet, And that made two of us, and baby made three. And now I am trying to learn how to do What I never learned how. But an escort service. Do you know what that really is? I only dated, and I quit. Besides... didn't you ever do anything you weren't completely proud of Because you didn't know what else to do, huh? Jordan, last night when I thought about you with that guy, all I could think of was how I would feel if I lost you, And I don't want that to happen. I love you and I love Jess. And I'm almost ready. I just need a little success To go with my good intentions. So, will you hang in there with me, huh? For just a little while? I lost my job today. Hello? Jordan, dear, I made a date for you tonight. I'm sorry. You have the wrong number. This is very important to me. This man is well-placed, And he asked specifically for you. No, that's the wrong number. Do this for me, Jordan. Just one more time. So I don't lose credibility with this man. You may keep the entire fee. I know you must need the money. Yes, right. He'll call and make the arrangements. Thank you. Hi. I got your message. Right on time. Look familiar? Yeah. I introduced you to this place. This is where we came on our first date. That's right. The first time that we sat here, I fell more in love than I have since high school. And I said to myself, "this will never work." then I said to myself, "why not? "What's a little difference in age, money, status, experience? "Nobody's exactly alike." I answered my own question, Why you finally let me pull the strings. Jordan west. Pretty name. Don't do the guilt thing. People make their own beds, and I have thoroughly enjoyed lying in this one. A drink? A beer. Two on tap, please. How'd you find this place? Uh, stumbled on it. Want to dance? Sure. We'll be right back. Jordan! Jordan! Is he another paying customer? I thought you quit being hired company. I never even realized you started. I should have realized that two lines in two years Wasn't keeping you in fancy cowboy boots. Sheilah has been a very good friend to me. I bet. She's been very supportive. - Supportive? - Yes, supportive. Oh, that's a nice word for it. I hope that somewhere in the English language you can scrape up as nice a word for what you've been, because I've got a lot on my mind right now and not one of them is nice. I'm sorry, but I hated to lose you to someone like that. Did you set that up? I thought you should see what she really is. You could hardly call this evening a date. Oh, keep it. I have to account to the taxpayers for it anyway. Vice squad. Mrs. Kennedy, it figures. I knew 60 seconds after we met you were no hooker. That's it. Okay. What was that? Cats. Mom, what happened? I'm scared! Be still. Stay quiet. I'm gonna light some candles. - Please... - Are your windows locked? - Yeah. - Okay. I'll call the police. Police department. Sergeant Miller speaking. Hello, sergeant, this is Jordan west. I live at 2433 Dennison Avenue, apartment 12a. I just heard some loud noises and all my lights are out. I know it's silly to call the police because all my lights are out, but somebody threatened my life recently and I’m... I'm alone here with my daughter and... And you're scared? Just stay in the apartment, Make sure all the doors and windows are locked. We'll send a man over. He'll be there in just a few minutes. Oh, Mrs. West... Don't make any calls, just in case we want to call through. Thank you. Oh, please hurry. Come on, Jessie. Come on, I'm gonna... We're gonna look at the windows now. What are we gonna do now? We're gonna get something to defend ourselves with, just in case. Here, you take this. - Hold on to me. - Okay. We're gonna put the candle out so he can't see us if somebody comes in. All right? Okay. Come on. Go in the corner and hide. Get down. Quick. I wish the police would get here... So do I. Oh. Oh, Jess. Oh, honey... I was so scared. Oh, must be the police. - You take this, huh? - Okay. Who is it? Police. Help! Help! Jess! I wasn't going to hurt her. I wasn't. Oh. Who is he? A date. Oh. You haven't seen him for a long time, but do you remember your father? Yeah. What do you remember about him? He was fun. Yeah, he was fun. We used to have picnics on the living room floor. We'd pretend we were at the zoo. Then we'd describe all the animals. Do you know why we couldn't go to the real zoo? Because we could never afford to go any place. Your father was always chasing any rainbow and losing track of it somehow. Everything was always fun, and that took the fun out of everything. I'm afraid it would be the same way with Beau, Jessie, Until we stop laughing. Do you understand that all? I don't know. Will you try? I love you.
