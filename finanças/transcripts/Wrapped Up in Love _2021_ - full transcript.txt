Oh, thank you, mom. Cookie, cookie, cookie. They're looking so good! Oh. Hey, no, cliff. What? Don't you want an impartial tester. For when you place these in front of the judges at the bake. Off? Ashley: You are emceeing the contest. You'll get to taste all of the cookies then. No. Hey. Let him have one. Just wait for them to cool down a little. Plus, they're not even decorated yet. Am I allowed to have any space whatsoever for my things? Ashley: Oh, sorry, mom. Just move anything you need for some space, ok? Oh, thanks. That's so generous of you in my house. Oh, come on. You invite me over here every year and ask me to do this. Andrea: Because if I didn't, I don't. Think I'd see you the entire month of December. Until Christmas day. Oh, seriously cliff? What? Oh. Well, how do they taste? Ashley, these cookies are absolutely delicious. Even if I did burn my mouth. Good. Serves you right. No. [music playing] Hi. The usual? How did you know. And... Yes! Your famous Christmas cookies are finally here. Can you marry a cookie? Because this is what I want to spend the rest of my life with. Is this the final version? I'm still tinkering with the recipe, but it's close. Well, here you go. Thank you so much. - Have a great one. - Thanks. See you later. You too. Here's your cappuccino. Ooh! I'm honored that the vice president of the store. Brings me my morning coffee. Please promise to still do this when mr. Collins retires. And you take over the store? Also, not to be greedy but is this all you have for me? I do believe Christmas cookies are in the building. Ah, word really does travel fast. Aha! See, this is why I love my queen of Christmas. I don't suppose you have a hot guy in there too? No, sadly not today. All right. Well, that needs to be a priority on your holiday. To-do list, ok? Because as much as I love you, we cannot have another year. Where we're each other's dates for new year's eve. Andie you know that Christmas is the busiest time of year. For me. The last thing I have time for is finding a date. Well, speak for yourself because I. Am determined to find someone to kiss at midnight this year. You know that was fine just the way it was. I know. I just want it to be perfect. That's why I love you and what makes doing this so much fun. Ashley Mckenzie to chase village please. Paging Ashley Mckenzie. Again? - Oh, jeez. - Here, leave it. - I got you. - Are you sure? - Andie: Mm-hmm. - Thank you. You're my hero. [music playing] Ooh. It's ok. It's ok. You... you really don't have to do that. Don't worry about it. Well, thank you. Ben: Yeah, no problem. Yeah, no, I just I'm trying to figure out how a seven-year-old can make such. A mess in less than five seconds. Sadly it's not the first time it's happened. Well, since you helped me, is there anything I can help you with today? Yeah, yes. Would you happen to know where mr. Collins' office is? Mr. Collins, the store owner. Ben: Yes. Yeah, he's just in the back where. The administrative offices are. I'm heading that way. I could show you? Great, yeah. Is there something you came in for today? Ben: Yeah. When I volunteered to play Santa I had no idea what I was in store for. Turns out the kid that made a mess in here. Also took out a Christmas tree on the main floor. Thanks, john. I'll be right there. Good. Bye. Never a dull moment. Sorry, I have to handle this. But if you follow this hallway all the way down there's. A really big door and he's behind that, so... Great. Thank you. Yeah, no problem. It's no problem. Ok, cliff, can you just move a little bit to the left? My left. Oh. Ok, and then do you think maybe you could smile? My smile left five minutes ago, ash. Ashley, I'm sure we already have a photo we can use. I am just asking for one more minute of patience, ok? Cliff, have I ever complained when. You ask me to carve 12 pumpkins on Halloween for your display? No. And mom, have I ever complained about wearing a turkey hat. On thanksgiving? I have not. So all I need is 30 more seconds, ok? Ok, I am pressing the timer now. Ok. Say Rudolph! Rudolph! Oh. Ok, yeah, no, it's not bad. I mean, it's not a "vanity fair" cover, but it'll do. Buh, buh, buh, buh. Let me see. I want veto power. Oh, absolutely not. No. You lost all of your privileges when you started playing around. With Photoshop. People still talk about that photo. And it was very embarrassing. Yeah, that was good. Oh, mom, you'll never guess who I heard from the other day. - Who's that? - Ben. You remember ben? Stephen: Who? Cliff: You know ben. We went to grade school together. Ben Collins? The two of you were inseparable. Sorry, who... who's this ben? Stephen: I'd forgotten all about him. Mr Collins' a son from his first marriage. Mr. Collins my boss? Mm-hmm. Ashley: He has a son? How did I not know about this. Andrea: Well, his parents divorced when he was young. And he went to live with his mother. And then I think to boarding school. I don't know. We never really saw him after that. Ashley: Huh, it's kind of strange. You'd think he would have mentioned him at some point. No, we don't know the whole story. I'm sure he had his reasons. So what brings him to town after so many years? Cliff: I'm not sure. I'm going to see him later though. I'll ask him. Can we do one more? Oh, please. Ashley: Ok, then of the three, I think. We should go with this one. I feel like we have this dilemma every year. What's wrong? You seem preoccupied. Ashley, you know how much you mean to me and the store. That's nice of you to say. And I've been trying to figure out. How to have this conversation for days. And... What? What is it? I have the same discussion with myself every year, What the future will bring, and should I hand over the reins. To someone else? Really? I... I had no idea. Well, I think you know how much I appreciate what you've. Done to bring the emporium to where it is. You're like family. So are you. Which is why I didn't want you to be blindsided. Oh. By? Well, you don't know this, but I have a son. From my first marriage, and he's come home. I... I actually found out about this yesterday. Oh? It turns out that my brother cliff. And him were friends when they were little. Oh. Ashley: I have to say, I'm I'm a bit surprised you never mentioned him. I'd say it's a tough situation to talk about, So generally I don't. I feel like I've failed as a father. But we're having a brand new start, I hope, And we're figuring things out. And hopefully he's going to help expand our online presence. I mean, you're still going to be the vice president in charge. Of day to day operations, but I'd love it. If you could show him the ropes, help him get a better. Understanding of how the business works. And if things work out, I'm hoping. He'll take a bigger role here. I see the two of you working together to make this store. The best it can be. Of course. Sure, yeah. You know, he's here. Why don't I introduce you? Oh, ok. Ben. Ben: Hey, everything ok in santa's workshop? Huh? Right, yes. Yeah, everything is fine now. Good. You two know each other? Ben: Yeah, we met briefly yesterday. Hi, I'm... Ashley. I... how did you know? Oh, cliff. Yeah, he told me you... He did. Ben: Ran things here. Right. Well, this makes me feel better. It's a good thing I think, huh? Well, you two must just have so much to talk about. So I'll leave you to it. Ben, I'm really looking forward to working with you. Same here. Ok. Oop, sorry. Oh, ok. Ok, bye. Bye. She's great. You're going to love working with her. There's so much you can learn from her. Dad, I have an mba. I've worked for companies a lot bigger than this. Yes, but I mean she knows the store backwards and forwards. And the employees love her. I mean, that's important. Well then, maybe you don't need me here. No, I'm sorry. I wasn't suggest... look, I know we have some things to work. Through. But you know, I don't want to get off on the wrong foot here. You know, I'm glad you're here. Ok. Ben sr: Great. Andie: So what have you heard? Rumor has it mr. Collins is bringing in some kind of wonder. Kid to help grow the business. Mm. Yeah, some kind of mba type with lots of ideas causing. A lot of changes. You know something. Hmm? You can't tell anyone. Promise. It's me! Come on. Ok, nothing has been announced yet, But yes, he is bringing in someone. And get this, it's his son ben. Mr. Collins has a son? Mm-hmm. Is he single? Is that seriously always your first thought? Yeah. I told you I'm determined to find a date for new year's eve. Don't tell me has a girlfriend or he's married. You really are unbelievable. No, he... apparently he came back because they haven't talked. In years and he wants to rebuild the relationship. Oh, that's kind of sweet. But how are you doing with all this? I mean, how is this going to impact you? I don't know. It's all so complicated. Nothing's been determined yet. But I can't say I'm not at least a little worried, Especially after putting in so much work the last few years. Well yeah, I mean, we both thought. You would take over for mr. Collins when he retired. But now you have to deal with the prodigal son returning? I hate to say it, but maybe you should reconsider. That other job opportunity. I know. I thought about that. I do want to see how things play out here, but you're right. It's probably smart to keep my options open, At least until I know what all of this means. Yeah, I don't disagree. So what's he like, the son? That's the worst part. He's actually really nice. Ok. The way you say that makes it sound like he's kind of hot. Oh, I did not say that. Ok, show me a pic. Show me a pic! Andie, why would I have a picture of him? Did you not do an internet search? No. Ashley. Ben Collins? Ben Collins. Huh. Huh? That's your response? Well, yeah. He kind of looks like this guy that was in my section today. And at first I was like, hello, hottie. But then he started asking all these weird questions. Well, strange how? Like he was talking about profit margins and efficacies. Of sale. And then when I heard the rumor I thought it was kind of odd. Yeah. Ben sr: Good morning. I know Christmas is our busiest season, which. Makes it tough on all of you. But I couldn't be more proud of this store, you, and what we've. Accomplished. I like to feel we're a family here. And without family, where would we be? And speaking of family, one of mine. Has come back into my life... My son ben. We recently reconnected. And as you can see, the apple hasn't. Fallen far from the tree. [chuckles] For me, this store is my life. And as I look to the future, I feel I've taken this store, the emporium, As far as I can on my own. But with ben's skills and experience, I know he can keep us competitive. And take this store to the next level. And to that end, please help me welcome my son ben. [applause] Thank you all for that warm welcome. I'm extremely excited to be... Oh god, why is he wearing that suit? I kind of love a man in a suit. Yeah, but it's a bit corporate don't you think? Ben: All of you as we bring the emporium. To the national stage. Thank you. [applause] Come on in. Candy cane? Uh, no, thank you. You may want to ditch the suit. I was worried you'd say that. I was getting a couple of looks from the crowd. Don't get me wrong, you look great in it. It's just I think for some people. It was a tad intimidating. You've seen the people around the store. No one really dresses like this. Ben: Yeah. Except for the salespeople. In the suit department. In the suit department, yeah. I was trying to make a good impression. Ashley: Oh, and I totally get that. It's just, you know, we're a tight knit group. Well, like your dad said, like a family. And the suit just feels a little... Management. Yeah. Yeah, you just want to be approachable. Thanks. And I'm still navigating these waters, so. I appreciate that. Yeah. Speaking of navigating waters, I. Know this is all new but I've been thinking. I've been walking through the store. And I think there's a couple of ways we can improve and update. Things. Oh. I... I was under the impression that you. Liked what I had done here. Oh, I do. I do. But I think change is good. I just... I want to keep the store in sync. With how people act and shop today. Ok. Um, such as? Well, we need to focus on some higher profit margin goods. Push people to order online, come into the store, Pick up what they ordered, and get out. It's just... it's more efficient over time. And it reduces overhead. Ok. It's not that it's a bad idea. It's just a little impersonal. Mm-hmm. What makes this store special is the personal touch. That we give to everything. And we have done surveys with our shoppers, And that's what's keeping them loyal. And I appreciate all that. But ultimately, we want to appeal to a broader customer. Base. People want things quick and easy, it increases sales, And everyone's happy. Don't you think you want to just, you know, Observe a little, settle before you start summarily. Making changes? Ashley, I've been doing this for years. That's great. So have I. And I hear that. But I bring in fresh perspective and years of experience. In the industry. Change can be good. I am not opposed to change, but I. Don't think that means that you completely ignore what's. Worked in the past. I have been working at this store for a very long time. And I have a pretty good idea of what works and what doesn't. Ok, I appreciate your competitive spirit. Oh, are we turning this into a competition? Because I do love a good challenge. Well, if that's how you want to play it, You do things your way and I'll do things mine, And I think you'll come to appreciate that mine are just. Better. Oh, I am so sorry to tell you that you are already. Losing because you are so wrong about that. Don't worry, I am very sure you'll get used to it. Cliff: She reacted how? Oh, I must have cut her off guard a bit. I mean, she's feisty. I like that. Yeah, she's feisty. There's no doubt. Well, you know, she's been there for years. Really making that store what it is. You got to understand for the past decade it's just been her. And your dad running the place, so you coming in probably. Threw her. Yeah. Yeah, I got that. Plus, she was raised in a house where we all. Played sports, you know? She's super competitive. And I know it might seem like she's got a rough exterior, But I'm telling you, on the inside she's a softy. She loves and knows that place better than anybody other. Than your father. You just got to respect that. Yeah. Yeah, I hear that. I just... I guess in some ways I'm jealous of her relationship. With him, you know? It's like they have the relationship I've always. Wanted. I just... it's like I don't know him at all, you know? Well, I'm positive Ashley would be more. Than happy to help in any way. She loves your dad. She would do anything for him. And I'm pretty sure this qualifies. You think she'd do it? Yeah, of course. Hey, you hungry? I could eat. My parents live really close to here. My mom is an amazing cook. Let's go grab some dinner. Ashley might be there. And I know my parents would love to see you. Yeah, that... that sounds great. Let me just run by mine. I don't want to show up empty handed. Ok. ♪♪ Can you get carpal tunnel from tying too many ribbons? [chuckles] how many is that? I don't even know, but I have four left. I can't wait to get mine. I look forward to it every year. Well, unfortunately you're going to have to wait this year. Because the first batch is going to the people at the s. I had no less than 10 people ask me about it today. Fine, but then you'll have to wt to get your batch of Christmas. Oh, but you know how much I... You know how much I love that s. Well, like you, I'm making it for the people at my work. I do love that you make so many homemade gifts for people. It's clearly rubbed off on me. It just means that much more. I agree. Even if my fingers fall off from tying all these bows. [cliff] mom? In here! [cliff] I've got a surprise for you! I hope it's okay to add one to dinner. Ben! Is that you? How long has it be? I don't think you even came up to my waist last time I saw. It's been, uh... It's been a while. Welcome. I hope this is not an imposition. Cliff said I could come over. Oh, of course not. We're just happy to see you. Hi, Ashley. Hi, ben. So how can I help with dinner? You can't. You're our guest, you relax. Everything's ready out here. An, cliff, you help me set the tabl. And Ashley, why don't you show ben around? Duty calls. Play nice. Wow, these decorations are beautiful. Your mom has a nice touch. I actually did them. Ahh. Guess I shouldn't be surprised. What is it you call yourself, the queen of Christmas? I don't call myself that, other people call me that. - I can't help what they say. - Right. Mmm, that candle smells amazing. Reminds me of Christmas at my h. I should probably buy a few for my place. I'm assuming you got them at the emporium? No, actually. I gave those to my parents for Christmas last year. I made the. [chuckles] Guess I shouldn't be surprised. After seeing the wonders you've done in the stor. I just really love making things for people for Christmas. I think these days people often buy something. Without really giving much thought to I. And it's so transactional. Whereas, if you make something for someone it just... It really shows them you care. That's odd, coming from someone who runs a department store. Don't get me wrong. You can absolutely buy something special for someone, too. That's why I like to support our local artisans. And have their stuff at the sto. [mom] dinner's ready! Mrs. Mackenzie, thank you so mu. This was amazing. Well, we're so glad to have you here at dinner and back in. Yes, and I get to work with your incredible daughter. I'm sure you both know how talented she is. Well, we are very proud of our little girl. She's done wonders at the store. Such attention to detail. That she gets from her mother. [mom] mm! Oh, which reminds me... This is for you. Ben, it's gorgeous. Did you make this? I did. I do a bit of woodworking in my spare. I have this really cool machine that carves any shape out of wo. As long as you put the design in the computer, Take it out, sand it off then varnish it and voilà. Ashley, would you look at this? It's very impressive... For something made by a computer. [dad] let's see. Ashley... It looks like he could give your ornaments a run for their money. I know just where I'm gonna put. It's getting the prime spot on the tree. Oh, you don't have to do that. [mom] but I want to. This is special. It deserves to be seen. Whoa. Ashley's ornament's getting dethroned. [chuckling] Oh. You're in on a Saturday morning. So are you! Hm. I was just looking through these cards. We... We pick one to send to our customers every year. It's just your dad forgot to choose one the other day. What do you think? We need to get his signature. Before I send anything off to the printer but... Hm. What? - Well, it's pretty, but... - But what? Every year we work with local artists. These are the three finalists. I think I'm leaning towards this one, though. Yeah. I mean, if you want to reach a wider audience... Why don't we just switch it up this year? Bear with me. I'm thinking a... A video e-Christmas card. Something that's super easy to share on social media. We could get everyone involved and it could be really. I don't know. We're just so cloe to the deadline already. To get these sent out. Aren't you the one saying that this store is one big happy fam? Uh huh. What better way to showcase that. Than getting everyone to participate in a card? I've been toying with some ideas and... Oh! Hey, dad. - Hey. What's going on? - Hey! Quick question for you. Ashley and I have been talking about the Christmas car. Yes, in fact, I actually have the final proofs here. For the concept that you approv. We just have to pick one. And I was thinking maybe we coud do something different this yea? Thinking of a video e-Christmas card. If it's well done, it could go viral, Bring national attention to the store. I like the sound of that. Keep in mind, Our customers love receiving these Christmas cards. Yeah, but Ashley, if we can reach out to a wider audience, You know, this might be something worth considering. How soon could something like this be done? Gimme a few days? Sounds good... And we've got the cards as a ba. Yep. Listen, I've got to run. I'll see you later. Okay. Oh, I didn't mean to... Oh, it's okay. I'm flexible. Um... Okay, I'm trying to be flexible. It's not that I don't like the, it's just not what we normally. Huh. So between the... Hmm... Ornaments and this, what is the tally? Oh, I'm sorry, are... Are we keeping score now? I think that's what you were doing earlier, yeah. Uh, hm. Well, first of all, I think my parents were just. Being kind because, uh... You were their guest, you know, with the ornament. I don't know. Your mom said my ornament was getting. Prime real estate on your tree. And second, the jury is still out on this v. So I wouldn't count your “views” before you've even uplo. That's cute. You know, in the business, a lot of people. Would say I'm an expert at this sort of thing. Before I came here, I was kind of a big deal in ret. Oh, that's right. I forgot about your power suit. Ha! Touché, well played. Well, I could really use your help on this video. You know everyone in the store, so... Okay, fine. But as long as you do not ask me to sing or dance, Because I have two left feet and a voice better left for the sho. That is a deal I can live with. Although I really want to see you sing and dance now. Yeah, that's never gonna happen! Okay. - Hey, ben! - Yes? Uh... Cliff and Andie and I were gonna go Christmas tree shopping later, if you want to tag along for th. Talk about the Christmas video. That'd be great. - Okay. - Okay. [sighs] Oh, by the way, I invited ben. You invited ben?! Yeah, he doesn't know anyone in town. Also, he... He wants to talk about the Christmas video and... Selfishly, I would like your opinion on hi. I'm still not entirely sure how I feel about him. Well, technically, I've already met him. Yeah, but I would like your unbiased opinion. [giggles] of course. Oh, hey! Good evening, ladies. Hey, Andie. - Hi! - Good to see you again. I know, it's been forever. How are you? - Yeah, I'm good. Good. - [Andie giggles] Oh, sorry! This is my buddy ben. [giggles] yes! We, um, met at the store. Haven't been formally introduce, but it's nice to see you. Nice to meet you again. Ashley. All right, guys, you ready to get your Christmas tree on? - [cliff snickers] - yeah. I just said that. Well, ben here went to a fancy boarding school, You know, in the woods? They did this whole outward bound sort of thing. Mm hm. So he knows a thing or two about the outdoors, don't you? Yeah. He can help you pick out the perfect Christmas tree. - It hardly makes me an expert.. - [Andie and cliff laugh] But I'm sure I can help. - Well, shall we? - We shall. What about this one? Um, I don't know about that one. That's a balsam. It cleans up really easily but it looks like it's crooked. Besides, I think you're more of a noble fir type. Really? Why do you say that? It's more classic, seems like it would suit you. Hmm, well... Maybe I'm not that predictable. What about this blue spruce? Has upturned branches, hold the ornaments nicely. Oh, so now you're the arborist. What can I say? I do my researc. Yeah, but uh, you would be picking up needles on a daily b. Now, the frasier fir, a little bit more costly, But it holds onto its needles better. Mm hm, except it doesn't have that good Christmas-y smell. True. Is that how people flirt these? I'm so off my game 'cause, you, I don't know anything about tre. Oh, well, you could practice your flirting on me. I've got years of experience in the field. I'll let you know if you're good or not. Okay, then. [chuckles] [Ashley] what about this one? Hmm, the silver fir. Soft, shiny needles, a great Christmas scen. You know how to pick 'em. Yeah, this is my tree. Yeah.

Put on a sequential twinkle light show. With an adorable Christmas theme? I think not. - No. - Yeah, 'cause it's gross. Okay. The best thing about Christmas is untangling the lights. And stringing them on the tree! - Debatable. - Speaking of which... Why don't you guys come over tomorrow. For a little last-minute tree-trimming party? Yeah! Well, that sounds like fun. - [cliff] yeah. - [Andie] yeah. Uh, since when has she started doing things last minut? [chuckles] I know. All right, cliff.

Um, would you want to come? - Uh, yeah. - Yeah? Um... - Let's go. - Okay. Oh, thanks. [Giggles] Right? It's just... It's such a knot. Okay. Cliff, I have told you time and time again. About how to put these away, ri? [Ashley] hey, guys. I always get a little scared when I see the two of you. Plotting this light system display without me. We really don't need the cops showing up again this year. So I've been thinking about some options. And I think we should go with something nice and traditi. Aw, come on, ash. I feel like we do that every year. No, come on. It would be really elegant. I mean, we could have all white lights, We could have white candles in the windows. It'd be very... Dickensian. Yeah, well, uh... I guess we could do that. Yeah, you know, that sounds really boring, ashl. Oh, come on, cliff. It's classic. Ben has good taste. Let's ask him. Yeah, that... That sounds nice. Although if you really want to p it up and show how much. - You care about Christmas... - There will be no amping. Yeah, no. Yeah, he can amp. Amp, amp! Yeah? Well, what you could do is get these really cool devices. That allow you to project holidy images onto the building, Onto your house. And then what we could do is sync the lights. To a music playlist and then tht would allow people. To just tune in and listen to it on the radio. That sounds amazing! I like the idea of the projecti. Yeah, you know what I like? The idea of cliffy's Christmas music playli. Let's just take a second. I really don't... What you can do, as well... And bear with me... You could get an led screen. That displays holiday greetings when people walk by or drive by. - [dad] great, good. - [cliff] I'm into it. When you're finished out here, I have some mulled cider to warm you up. Oh, mom, we were just talking about. What to do for the Christmas lights display this y. I was thinking something really elegant, Classic, traditional, all white lights. That sounds nice. Yeah, or... Or a synchronized light show set to music! Yeah, yeah, yeah! And video projections! You could do that? Yeah, it's super easy. You just download the app. And it coordinates everything. - Easy as pie. - I vote for that. [sighs] - Uh huh. - [Ashley]great. Then I guess I will just leave you to it. Okay, great. Okay. The emporium wishes you love, joy and cheer. True gifts that keep giving throughout the whole ye! [mr. Collins] great, isn't it? Oh, he showed you. Yeah, he sent me a link. Said he was working late last night on it. Have you seen him yet today? No, I haven't. But I'm sure he'll be very happy that you liked it. I know a lot of people were working very hard on it. Ashley, can I ask you a questio? Did I do something wrong? What do you mean? You know... I'm kind of hurt he didn't ask me to be in it. You know, he said he didn't want me hover. Congratulations. You've just described every parent/child relationship. You're like a second dad to me. And sometimes I don't want you hovering over me. I want you to... To trust me to do the work that you hired me t. Yeah, but we've built up that trust over years. I missed out on just being around him, you know, And I don't know how to make up for that. Just do the best you can. Right now, in this moment. You two aren't as different as you think. In fact, sometimes it's eerie how similar you are. Just be there for him. [exhales] Can you believe that he derailed my plan for the lights? I mean, what is it with men and technology? You slap a circuit board on something or give it an app. And suddenly that's all they wa. And especially after I helped him with the video? He had to go and one-up me with my own family. I don't think I've ever seen you so flustered. What's going on? Oh my god. You like him. Yeah, like... Like that much. You like him! He's just... He's so great in so many ways. You know, when we're in sync it's perfect. And then here are these moments like the lighs. That I just really question how I feel. How can you like something. And then really want to change t all at the exact same time? You've literally described every boyfriend I've ever had. [chuckling] true. Um, so... Speaking of awkward relations hi, I wanted to ask you something. What? What's the deal with cliff? Huh? What do you mean? Well, when we were all together. The tree trimming, there was kind of a moment. With my brother? I mean, I guess I just never tht about you two like that, but... Really? Yeah. But I wouldn't want to do anything if it'd be weird for y. - Because I really wouldn't... - No! To affect our relationship because I love you and... No. No, no, no. You should go for it! Okay. One of us should be happy. Thank you. It might just be a tad awkward for me. To be your third wheel for the new year's now, though. - It could be fun, though. - Yeah? I mean, we'll probably be getting married soon so... [laughs] [ben] and you see, it's already at 30,000 views. Ben, this is really great. You know, a bunch of people came up to me this morning in town. And told me how much they loved. Well, we really wanted to capture the spirit of the store. And show how great of a family we are. Well, you certainly did that. Now about this chief operating officer role. Are you sure that's what you really want? Absolutely. I've never been so sure of anything before. But, um... What about Ashley? How do you think she'll take it? Well, it may not be what she pictured for herself, But I'm sure she'll see that I's in the best interest of the com. But let's wait for the right moment to tell her, okay? Absolutely. In the interim, congratulations, mr. Coo. Thank you so much. Let's run it again. Thank you so much. Have a good. [Ashley exhales sharply] Honey, what's wrong? You look I I can't believe what I just heard, Andie. What? Mr. Collins and ben were talking about his getting the coo job. After everything you did? That's crazy! The worst part is that ben was wondering. How I would take it and they both assumed. That I would be fine with it and understand. - No! - I mean, I get it. I get it. Ben is his son and he is smart and he is so, so capable. It's just that I've put in so much hard work for this. Over the last few years. Maybe I should just move on. I'm just surprised that ben would do this to you. Yeah, I mean I knew that he was going to be. An integral part of the company moving forward. I did, I knew t. But I never in a million years. Thought that after showing him the ropes here. And making town feel like home for him, that he would just. Take the one job that I've worked so hard for. And now you have feelings for him. - Yeah. - Yeah. [sniffles] Which makes the fact that he stepped over me. To get what he wants even harde. I could never be with someone wd do something like that to someo. What are you going to do? I am going to take the other jo. [sniffles] I'm going to take the other job and I'm going to give ben. Some real competition while I'm working for our main rival. Yeah. Let me buy you a coffee. We'll figure this out. Come on. Yeah, I'm looking forward to it, as well. It's a great opportunity. [laughs] I'm excited. All right. Bye. Can I come in? Yeah. Of course. As long as the lack of project is in my office doesn't bother you. Hm. Okay, yeah, I deserve that. Which is kind of why I'm. I felt bad I derailed your plan with the lights the other. You and I, we have this thing. Sometimes I go too far even though I want to be helpful. Yeah. I have to say I was a bit surprised, Especially after I helped you with the vid. I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking. Well, it seems you always get your way, so I swear it's not intentional. Is that all? Yeah. Okay, I just... I have a lot of loose ends that I need to tie up. Before the end of the day so... Okay. ♪♪ ♪ Christmas time, full of love ♪ ♪ I want to see you again and again ♪ [exhales sharply] Who's going to bring me my coffee to work every day? I know.

Well, I hope the new company kns what a superstar they're gettin. Hm. They do. They kept telling me how excited they are to have me. Especially after I initially turned them down. I have to admit, it is nice to feel wanted. So when are you going to tell mr. Collins? Oh, god. I hadn't even thought about tha. I don't know if I can face him. As exciting as this opportunity is, it's... It's really bittersweet. I don't know if I can go back into the emporium again. It's going to be too hard to say goodbye to everybody. But you have to tell them, you? Yeah. If I write a letter of resign at, will you give it to them? You know I would do anything for you. Thank you. Because I also might need you to clean out my office. Okay, well, these look really g. So I will get your stuff in exchange for a tin of these. - Deal. - Deal. - Two tins? - No, just one.

In this sort of competitive way, you know. It seems every time I want to impress her, it just.. It just has the opposite effect. Well, maybe you stop trying to impress her. And just show her you care. Hm. There's this cookie bake-off thing she's really excited abou. Do you remember when we made Christmas cookies.

Wow, that's so sweet and that's so selfless of him. Yeah, I wish there was something we could do. Maybe there is. I have an idea. What if we use this technology to benefit others? Like, think about it. People could come into the store and they could... They could adopt a family or a bunch of families if they wante. I mean, if people could buy an item of clothing. Or a toy, then we could make these families' holidays magic a. Yeah, and since the video went viral, I could put a link at thd. Of the video so people could just easily. Donate if they wanted to. - Yeah. - Better yet... We could get the store behind ts. And then when people are checking out we could ask tm. If they're interested in helping a family in need.
