Morning, Carruthers. You're late. I waited a half hour for the bus, so I walked. Then I had to fight my way through the chorus of "Miss Saigon" down there. Anyway, I'm off. Carruthers. Hmm? Is that your real name? Yes, it is. Why? How long have you been on this assignment, Harry? Two years. Anything ever happen across the way? Well, they've changed the curtains. And the windows... they're now bulletproof, I think. Hmm. You'd better start filling in the C1 form. Otherwise you'll have Colonel Wilson on your back. Carruthers. Yes? They also started taking milk. I think they're secretly putting it in their tea. Very valuable. Thank you, Harry. Woo-hoo. Hello? Jean. It's me, Harry. Well, hello, Harry. What's that noise? Oh, that... That's, uh, some students outside the North Korean embassy. What do they want? I don't know what they want. I know what I want. Great. So we're on for tomorrow night? Yeah. Where, you think? My pad. I'll think up something spicy. I hope so. Hold on a moment, Jean. Looking ugly. - Well, thanks. - Uh, no. No, not you. You sure you want to see me tomorrow night? Of course I'm looking forward to seeing you. Been a long time, no? Very long time. Uh-oh. I'll call you back. Get down! Who the hell are you? Palmer What the fuck are you doing here? MI... you wouldn't believe me. What? Red death. What did he say? Death to the Reds, I think. Couldn't find his passport anywhere, but we've managed to identify him. His name is Anatole Kulbitsky. He's Russian, a genetic research scientist, and I'll bet he's a part-time KGB agent. I think he most probably had a heart attack. Do me a favour, doctor. Have a look at his chest, just about there. Hmm. If it's a poison, it must be a very powerful. It's the old Bulgarian umbrella trick. KGB speciality. I thought they were out of business. Here, mate. Where do you think you're going? It's me, Palmer. Uh, make a note... I'm having lunch with Harry MacMillan at The Front tomorrow. Oh, do you want to see me, Palmer? - Yes, sir. - Oh. You'll have to make an appointment with Henrietta. You sent for me, sir. Oh, did I? Yes, sir. Well, in that case, you'd better come in. Oh, and Henrietta, remind me to call my wife in four minutes. Very nice. Shut the door, will you, Palmer? I suppose you'd better sit down. You probably guessed what I need to talk to you about. Uh, yes, sir. The dead Russian at the North Korean embassy. I read your report. Pass the file to Carruthers. Oh? I thought I was dealing with that. You've seen the headlines? I haven't read the papers, uh, sir. We've been very busy, what with these staff reductions. Don't get much time to read the paper. Which brings us to your case. Oh, yes. Here we are, Palmer. As I feared, we're going to have to ask you for accelerated retirement, effective immediately. Of course, you'll have your pension. Unfortunately, Grade 5, your acting rank, has never been confirmed. So you'll only qualify for Grade 6. Bastards. I beg your pardon? I'd like to remind you, sir, that I have been with this department for 30 years. Well, we mustn't live in the past, Palmer. I have been involved in some very important cases. There was the, uh, Ipcress File affair, the funeral business in Berlin. Yes, yes, yes, yes, Palmer. All before my time with the department. I don't deny that you have done some good work in your time. But that was yesterday, and today is today. Thank you, Palmer. Well, good luck in the city street, Palmer. You never really were the proper military type. Screw you. What did you say? Goodbye, sir. Give my regards to your wife in a customary manner. Hello? Mr. Palmer? Speaking. We understand that your services might be available. Meet us tomorrow at the Savoy Hotel at noon. We assure you it will be worth your while. Thanks. Cheers. For you. Will you be eating? Not now. Just a drink? Yes, please. Follow me, please. Could I have a vodka on the rocks, please? Yes. Right away, sir. I'm expecting someone. My name is Palmer, if anyone asks. Very good, sir. - Uh, Mr. Palmer. - Yeah? Someone left this for you at the cloak room. - Thank you. - My pleasure. Here's your drink, sir. Thank you. You're welcome. St. Petersburg, Russia. Oh. Mr. Palmer. Mr. Palmer. That's me. Won't you follow me, please? There's a car outside. Where else? Have we met before? Well, we've never been introduced. My name's Nikolai. Oh, by the way, who was the woman who phoned me in London? Oh, that would be mother. Very original. We use that. Will I be meeting her? No. Follow me. Where are we going? You'll find out when we get there. We're being followed, aren't we? Yes, we are. In a car? You still do that here? Yes. Is there a seat belt? No. Who are they? The Chechens. Is that bad? Very. Are you planning on losing them? He's staying with us. Shit. What? Plan B. Oh. This is plan B? Get out. She's a girl! She knows. Now would you get in the boat? Who are they after? You! Why me? I only just got here. You'll find out later. Now get on the boat! I'll get on the boat. Are you in charge of this operation? Yes. You're a bit young for the job, aren't you? Mr. Palmer, if you don't worry about my youth, I won't worry about your age. What's she saying? Get down now! Stop! Stop? Get down! What the bloody hell? My job is to get you where you're going alive. That's what I intend to do. Now, stay down and shut up! Got it. Watch out, he may not be dead. He's dead. I'm sorry about that, uh, incident. Call that an incident? Bloody hell. Is that that the Hermitage? Yes. I never made it there last time. You won't this time either. You want to tell me where we're going? To see Alex, Who's Alex? Alex is a... Ah, animals! A true survivor. He's outlasted many regimes... Brezhnev, Khrushchev, and hopefully Yeltsin. You speak very good English. I was educated in England. My father's English. My mother's Russian. That accent... Where'd you go to school? Eton. I thought you bloody did. Who is this? A friend. You sure? Natasha... Ah, Mr. Palmer. Welcome back to Russia. You call this a welcome? I've been shot at, practically... Shh. I apologize. You're working for me now. And I suppose I have enemies. A bonus. Another $5,000. Let's call it danger money. A good name for it, sir. Jaron, baggage. Mr. Palmer, you must be curious as to why I brought you to Russia. You could say that, sir. Yes. Let me help you. My name is Alex Rexovich. This is my home. Nikolai, leave us alone, please. Please. Come this way, please. It's a nice place you got here, sir. Yes. A legacy of pre-revolutionary days. You must be tired, Mr. Palmer. Oh, knackered, actually. I will endeavour to satisfy your curiosity. I want to employ you on some extremely secret business. Why me? The usual agencies have their disadvantages. The police are unreliable and indiscreet. And for various political reasons, the KGB are no longer suitable. It's very hard, you know, these days to find, um, unswerving loyalty in brand new market economy. So I get the job? Whatever it is. Britain's loss is my gain. So, cheers. You see, Mr. Palmer, Russia is a country that has always needed a strong man as a saviour. I'm going to dedicate what is left of the rest of my life to that end. I have an agenda. And what is that? I'm sorry, I cannot tell you that yet. But believe me, our ends will justify the means. You see, before the dissolution of the USSR I was in charge of some extremely secret research into the science of genetics and its military implications. Well, that has since been privatized. I am now what you call the chairman of the board. And now, one of its most important genetic experiments has disappeared. But please, eat, Harry. Eat. Please, sir, do. Good. The code name of our project was Alorex. Our earlier experiments were with rodents. I see. But as our knowledge advanced, we planned to move on to human subjects. Oh, really? Please sit. Centuries ago, there was a plague, which came from the Orient by way of Russia. It destroyed between 2/3 and 3/4 of the population of the West. It was called a Black Death. I was starting to wonder why you wanted me. One single drop of Alorex is enough to mutate and destroy the entire population of a city of 1 million souls. They would become the human counterparts of these rodents. Oh, bloody disgusting. That is why we call it the Red Death. I see. Alorex is a binary product. Binary... what's that mean? Made up of two separate substances. It's only when these are combined together it becomes dangerous. Last week, we discovered that our sample was missing, along with a certain Professor Kulbitsky. Kulbitsky? I don't know that name. Uh, who would... who would want to, uh, buy, uh, this... What do you call it? Red Death? Well, our information tells us that it's a certain ambitious but politically unacceptable power. China? Too obvious. Try again. What about North Korea? Has it occurred to you, sir, that whoever stole the Alorex might have already tried to sell it? Our information is, the Alorex has not yet reached the customer. That's why you're here, Mr. Palmer. I want you to find the route by which it's being shipped. You must locate the courier. And what else? Bring the Alorex back by whatever means you find necessary. I'm not being over dramatic, Mr. Palmer, when I tell you the fate of the world could be in your hands. Oh, I've saved the world a couple of times before, sir. What's the going price now? 250,000 American dollars in cash. No Rubles? No Rubles. Perhaps I should warn you, Mr. Palmer. The people who followed you here from the airport today must have known why I brought you here. They wanted information. I haven't any information to give. In that case, they would have killed you. Well, Mr. Palmer? $250,000, that's, uh, 180,000 pounds, right? Yeah. Earned abroad, tax-free. It's a deal. When do I start? You have already started. When? This morning. Oh. You think we could have a quieter day tomorrow, Nick? Nikolai. You're on your own tomorrow, Harold. Harry. OK, fellas. Let's go. Hello, my name is Palmer. I have a reservation. Welcome to the Nevsky Palace Hotel, Mr. Palmer. Here is your registration card. And may I have your passport please? It's a formality to stamp your visa. Yeah. Thank you. You'll get it back in an hour. Hello, Harry. Sorry. It's good to see you, Andrei. You too. How are things at the Lubyanka? The prison is now a tourist attraction, and I'm the manager of this restaurant. Happens to the best of us. Let's have a drink. Here is to glasnost, perestroika, democracy. To market economy and big tits. Big tits. Yeah. Cheers. I'm looking for a firm that's stolen a deadly poison. A substance called Alorex. Well, um, there are three mafia groups in St. Petersburg. It could be any one of them. At least crime is flourishing in Russia. Yep. I should like to make you a present, Harry. I think you'll need it. I could offer you a Luger, a colt, or its Russian equivalent. I'll take the colt. You see that man looking at us? His name is Yury Stephanovich. He's a big shot in the St. Petersburg mafia. Would you like to meet him? If you must. I don't think you have a choice. Hello, Yury. Meet Harry Palmer. I have heard about you, Mr. Palmer. You work for Alex. You should know that a friend of Alex is not a friend of mine. I'll bear that in mind. Russia can be expensive. Bloody hell. You're not kidding. But some things are cheap. For instance, for $200 you can have a man killed. Here's to a long life. Whose life, Mr. Palmer? She's pretty. Louis, sorry I'm late. Hi. How are you? It's been a long time. Yeah, it sure has. Long time, Louis. Who's this? My grandson Sasha. Hello, Sasha. Hello. Ah, he speaks English. The future. Here with the "New York Times?" No. They said that they're no longer a contact with the KGB. I didn't fit in their budget. You've lost the KGB? They didn't have a budget. What about CIA? They said the reason was budget cuts. And the French Suret? Oh, they simply stopped paying me. Oh, Louis. You lost all your contacts, eh? Oh, I still keep in touch with everybody. I have lots of friends. You still do the English football balls, Louis? Every week. What brings you to St. Petersburg? I need your help, Louis. You only have to ask. But I could use a little money. Oh, why not, Louis. Could you make it dollars, Harry? Why not, Louis. $100 do you? Could you make it $200, Harry? Why not, Louis. That OK? - Thank you. - All right? How much? 10,000, Harry. This will bring him good luck. Thank you. You're welcome. It looks like our good luck is running out. What? Behind us. Don't look now. Walk normally. Car's around the corner. Stop. It's OK. It's OK. Why are they after you? I guess they found out I'm looking for the Alorex. You know about the Red Death? Yeah. That's why... Down! Hey! Louis! Louis, unlock the door. What? Open the bloody door! Louis! Louis. Louis! Unlock the bloody door! Unlock the door! It's OK, Sasha. It's all right. Shit. Bloody gun. Harry, it's me! Will you stop following me? I don't need... Give me the gun. Get in the car. - Go that way. - Go that way. Louis! Mr. Palmer, you used to work for British intelligence? Yeah, but not anymore. So you say. What brings you to Russia, Mr. Palmer? Business or pleasure? Pleasure. But I haven't had very much so far. It appears from your visa that you are here as a tourist. Yeah. Looking, seeing the sights. Some of them are not very pretty. For instance, those three gangsters you found dead. Did you kill them? I don't even have a gun, Captain. But a police car has been badly damaged. Yeah, well, I wasn't driving the other car. What have you been up to, Mr. Palmer? Well, you know, I just been seeing old friends. Apparently you have some quite important old friends. And enemies. But if I were you, Mr. Palmer, I would be very, very careful. Some people would prefer you dead. I don't even know who they are, Captain. By the way, make sure that you don't break the law. Yes, sir. Mm. Thank you, sir. Excuse me, sir. Thanks for the lift, sir. Appreciate that. This is for you from grandfather. This is from me for good luck. Thank you. Thank you. "Take the Bullet to Beijing tonight at midnight. The Alorex will be on board. Be careful. They're trying to kill you." Yes? Just a minute. Can I come in? It's OK. No one knows I'm on the train. You're... You're Natasha. The girl in the boat. You've been following me. That's right. Oh. You're an American? No. No, I'm Russian. Russian? Uh, well, uh, my father was a military attach in Washington, so I, uh, grew up in America. Oh. Are you going somewhere? Do you like it? Yeah, it's, uh, very nice. Well, what can I do for you? Well, actually, Harry, I was hoping there was something I could do for you. Oh, you feel I might be a bit lonely, right? Well... Are you trying to seduce me? Because if you are, I don't know any secrets. Hey. Hey. Hey. You haven't done this before, have you? No. I thought so. Sit up. Go on. Sit up. Do you want to tell me why you're really here? Hmm? No? You're working for Alex, aren't you? Did he send you here? Come on. I'm supposed to help you in any way I can. Funny you should say that, because I do need some help. Could you have breakfast with me in the morning? Breakfast? Yeah. Just breakfast. Thanks. Harry Palmer. You don't remember me? No. Well? Well. Well? Well, what do you think? I did my job. Isn't that what you wanted me to do? Craig Warner. CIA? Washington. 1983. Yeah, yeah, yeah. What are you up to? Well, I'm not working for Uncle Sam anymore. They were cutting back to their last 20 aircraft carriers. They made me expendable. Well that'll help. What are you doing here in Russia? Sort of freelancing. I'm really glad to see you. Great to see you. By the way, uh, congratulations. Old friend of the family. Oh. Nice to see you. Good. You, uh, got any spares? No. Hey buddy, let's get together. Sure. I'd like to hear what you've been up to. Take care. Yep. Good morning. Tea, please. You know him? He's an American. I know who he was, but I don't know who he is. Piva, Heineken. Do you know him? Who? Him. Oh, that's Colonel Gradsky. What does he do? He was a diplomat. And KGB. Another unemployed spy. He works. For whom? I don't know. Honest? Who is it? Nikolai. Evening, Harry. What a surprise. You're following me? Just making sure you were all right. Alex wants to make sure I don't get lonely, huh? I could do with a drink. Care for a midnight stroll? How'd you know I was on this train? Don't tell me... Alex knows everything. You said your father was English. That's right. Do you know what he did for a living? Only what my mother told me. He was in intelligence. British intelligence? That's right. Maybe you knew him. Maybe. Why didn't your mother try to keep in touch with him? It's not easy to keep in touch with British intelligence. It is hard to find, isn't it? You see, when they met, she was also in intelligence. In Russian intelligence? Oh, I see. The old honeypot trap. But they fell in love, and I was the one who got stung. She kept me a secret from him. You were educated in England, eh? At Eton. Who paid for that? My motherland. Oh, you regard this as your motherland, do you? Well, it certainly is my mother's land. But is it yours? Yes. But your father was English. When you don't know your father's name, you'd be amazed how often the word bastard comes up in conversation, especially at Eton. You don't think you were the only bastard at Eton, do you? No. So now you work for Alex? Yes. Is he a bastard? No. He may be the one man to save us Russians. I hope you're right. How much does he tell you? As much as I need to know. Do you know the reason I'm on this train? No. Alex asked me to find something. Will you help me look for it? My job is just to keep an eye on you, but you might want your gun back. Thanks. What does that say? "To be delivered to the North Korean embassy, Beijing, China." It's got a diplomatic seal. Let's open it. Think that's a good idea? I'm going to show you how to open the box without disturbing the seal. That's far enough, Mr. Palmer. I'd prefer you both with your hands up. Thank you. That's better. I didn't notice much improvement. I'm afraid we have different points of view, Mr. Palmer. Why can't we be friends, Colonel? I understand you're ex-KGB. We're both in the same boat. We're both recently redundant. But not inactive. At the moment, Mr. Palmer, your curiosity is causing me some inconvenience. What are you going to do? Shoot us? Well, I'm not a cruel man. And you're right, we are all... What is the phrase? In the same boat. And up the creek. You said you weren't a cruel man, Colonel. Can we wait for a slow bit? Get off. My bloody arm. Is this Siberia? Of course it's bloody Siberia. You haven't got a train timetable, have you? "Can we wait for a slow bit?" I can't believe you bloody said that. Where the hell are you going? Follow the train. This is the only way it can go. We have a track... A trail. Have you got a better idea? Yeah, shoot you. Have you ever been chucked off a train before? No, I've never been that stupid. Have you? Yeah. And twice. What did you do then? I took a taxi. It was in London. The hell did that come from? There's an airport. Huh? There's an airport. Over this way. What did she say? She said that, uh, the ticket office will be open a little later. I'll toss you for it. Heads or tails? Heads. What does that say? Cafe Bar. I'll be in there. Shit. So what'd you find out? Well, the good news is, I got two tickets on the evening flight to Irkutsk, and the train doesn't get there until tomorrow morning. Right. So what's the bad news? Nick, you said there were only two seats left on the plane. One in the cockpit with the pilot... Yes. I know, I know. And the other in the toilet. Heads or tails? Tails. You're in the toilet. Hang on, let me... I'm learning from you all the time. For the benefit of our English passengers, please make sure that everything is in the upright position and prepared for taking off. Thank you. When do we get to Irkutsk? When do we get to Irkutsk? We shall not get to Irkutsk. Not enough gas. You must have known that before you left. On this plane, nothing works. How was I to know the fuel gauge works? We land here. Bratsk? Where the hell's Bratsk? Down there. Congratulations. How was the cockpit, Harry? You don't want to know. How was the toilet? Harry, meet Illona. Illona, Harry. Hello. You found her in the toilet? Oh, this is not Irkutsk. No, no. - This is, uh, Bratsk. - Bratsk? Bratsk? Where the hell is Bratsk? It's somewhere else in Siberia. But I must get to Irkutsk. My mother is waiting there for me. I wish my mother was, love. You think there's a Hertz or Avis around here? I wouldn't bank on it. I'll tell you what. If we could find a place where we could buy vodka, I bet we'd find our way to Irkutsk. One over there. Yeah. That might be a bar. We have American dollars. And we will give to anybody who would drive us to Irkutsk $1 for each mile. Come here. You will drive my friends to Irkutsk. Go. - Go. - Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Eh, my capitalist friends. OK, let's go. I suppose you're checking in with Alex, are you? Come on. Bratsk? Where the hell is Bratsk? Mm. Mommy. Daddy. You'll see your mummy in the morning. Hello? What did you tell Harry Palmer? Tell him? I told him the Alorex was on the train. Well, Colonel Gradsky has had him thrown off the train, and I have a feeling it's your fault. Alex, you're my best friend. I did nothing. Alex. Alex, I did nothing. What do you want, Louis? I am busy! It wasn't my fault. I just did as I was told. I gave the message to Harry to watch Colonel Gradsky. Don't you realize, you bloody fool? Gradsky works for Alex! I want what Gradsky has got. That's why Professor Kulbitsky was working for me. Harry Palmer is becoming a nuisance. Where is he now? Bratsk. Bratsk? Where the hell is Bratsk? Wait a minute. I know somebody in Bratsk. Louis, don't talk to anybody. Stay home. Yury want Harry Palmer killed! How far to Irkutsk? Oh, I suppose about five miles. What time is it? Nearly 8 o'clock. What time does the train leave? 8:15. No problem. Just pick any gear, they're all in the same box. Funny. What time is it? 10 past 8:00. We've got plenty of time. Five minutes. No problem. What the fuck? Faster! I've got my foot on the floor! Look out! Where'd you learn to drive like that? We'll never make it. Buy yourself a new car. Say goodbye to your mother. I'm too old for this! Goodbye! Woo! Surprise. Two surprises. What are you doing here? She's my daughter. What? She's my daughter. He is your father? Yes. Three surprises. Sit down. If your father is the courier I'm looking for, he may be stealing from Alex. And you are helping him. He's not stealing from Alex. We're both working for him. You're both working for Alex? Then why did you throw us off the train? I didn't know you were working for Alex until Natasha told me, and by then you were both somewhere in Siberia. Tell me about it. So we're all working for Alex, right? Question. What have you got in the box that you're taking to Beijing? I don't know. You don't know? When you work for Alex, you don't want to know. I think it's time you found out. Open it. Why didn't you tell me he was your father? Because I was told not to. You know how Alex works. Nobody's told more than they need to know. Give me one of the bottles. Substance A232. Open it. Are you crazy? No, it's all right. Alorex is a binary chemical weapon. It consists of two ingredients, both of which are harmless separately. A232 is one of them. It's probably disguised as fertilizer or some other industrial chemical. Put the top back. Welcome back, Harry. Do yourself a favour. Put that gun away. Close that case. You're not up to your old tricks again, are you Craig? You haven't got the other half of the Alorex, have you? Huh? You still making guesses? I know. You deliver the Alorex and get paid and heroin in Beijing. Arms for drugs, just like the Contras in Nicaragua. Another guess. I don't have to guess where you fit in, Craig. We're all working for Alex. And you, Colonel, are about to start smuggling drugs. That's why he's here. He's an expert. He's here to make sure the drugs are pure. Quite a step down, eh, Colonel? From military attach in Washington. That's enough. You, open the door. What is it? Mongolian border. I recommend we all go back to our compartments and get our passports as quickly as possible. Now move. Move it! Did you know about this? Or were you told not to tell me? Is this how you're building Alex's new Russia? I don't know who this guy is, but Harry's wrong. I never knew the whole story. Well, the North Koreans get the Alorex, Alex gets the drugs and winds up stinking rich. We have to stop him. No one can stop him. We can try. You're letting him make a fool of you. Alex doesn't care about Russia, or you, or me, or anyone else but himself. Natasha has been trying to turn him against Alex. But it could be suicide. Our whole lives have been suicidal. What do you say? What does he say? I say that Alex has an agenda. I say that he knows what he's doing and why he's doing it. I say neither you or anyone else here is going to stop it. That's what I say. You know what Alorex is and what it does. What do you say to that? The end justifies the means. I bet you get paid in drugs, not cash. But that wouldn't be a problem with you either, would it? That's why he had me carry $5 million to Switzerland. That's right. At least we can do something about the Alorex. Will you help me? Cheers. Needs something else. Another ingredient. I know just the ingredient. Be back in a minute. Keep drinking, Colonel. I can't top off all these bottles by myself. In less than an hour, we'll be in Beijing. I just don't want to be around when North Koreans find out what's in my case. Your contact in Beijing is Kim Soo, right? He was in the embassy at London. I know him well. My problem is, I still haven't found the other ingredient. You don't have it, do you? No. What about Natasha? No, not Natasha. Alex wouldn't trust her that far. And Nick? Not his job. Well, there's no one else. What did they say at airport security? Is this your bag? Did you pack it yourself? Did anyone give you a present? Take the Bullet to Beijing. The Alorex will be on board. No wonder Louis knew it would be on board. The Bullet to Beijing. And I thought it was a fucking train. Colonel Gradsky, the Honourable Kim Soo sends greetings. So, please follow me, please. You too, Mr. Palmer. Please. You come with us too. You can keep Harry company. What the fuck are you doing, Craig? Your job is done. Get lost. Get moving. So this way, please. You still think the end justifies the means? Guess your way out of this, Harry. Greetings, my dear Colonel, and welcome back to Beijing. Kim Soo, may I present my daughter, Natasha. I am honoured to meet you, Natasha. Harry. Good to see you again. Hello, Kim See. Long time no Soo. Mr. Palmer is an old friend. When I was at our embassy in London, we used to meet for lunch every Friday, and toss for what I put him on my expense account or he put me on his. We usually did both. Hey, you have new dirty stories, Harry? Of course, Kim. Uh, Mr. Warner, everything is ready. Please take a look. So this is A232. Hmm. Strange. I expected a stronger smell. Could be vodka with a little bit of ammonia. Well, we'll soon find out about that. Harry, you have something for me? No. Something from Louis. From Louis. Is that it? That's it. One more thing, Harry. Your passport. Passport? How am I going to get out of China? Don't worry. We have plenty of new British passports. Why do you need my passport, then? Souvenir of old friend. Souvenir, huh? We really must be going, or we may miss the train. You Russians, always in a hurry but getting nowhere. And Mr. Warren, you satisfied? Yeah. Everything checks out. You may go now. Uh, Mr. Warner, the merchandise will be in the truck. It's been great to see you again. I am truly sorry about this, Harry. Unfortunately, you know too much. Looks harmless, doesn't it, Harry? It will take 24 hours to find out. And if there is a problem, we will find our friends, and they will die too. Kim Soo, it's Nikolai Petrov, Alex's assistant. Is Mr. Palmer there? Yes. We have him. There's been a change of plan. I've had an order from Alex. Mr. Palmer has to come back to Russia, and we'll take care of him later. Don't worry. I'll take care of him. All right, Harry. You can go now. I don't like these new passports. Tell me, Kim Soo, would you really have done it? Happily, we will never know, will we, Harry? If Alex thinks I'm dead, you're going to have to find me a safe house. You all right, Nick? No, thank you. Nick? I'm going to break rule number one. I'm going to tell you more than you need to know. The Alorex was fake. Really? So why did Alex hire me? To make it look real. It was a scam. We sell fake Alorex to the North Koreans and they finance our cause. When they find out it's fake, you take the fall. Finance your cause? Finance it with heroin? Because that's what it was. I saw it. Or didn't Alex tell you that? It was real heroin and real Alorex. Kim Soo asked me for my passport. I always carry two. I gave him one, and this is the one that I handed in at the hotel... The one that Alex knew I had to take with me. And this is what Alex left inside. The formula for Alorex. And you know where he got it? From the passport that you and the old lady lifted off Kulbitsky's body. Yeah, I saw you. You were in London. Were you saving Russia then? Huh? Do you know how much that's worth? Millions of dollars on the open market. And it could cost millions of lives. Give me your lighter. I'll show you what I think of it. It's not Alex who is saving Russia. It's you who should be saving Russia from Alex. There's one more thing that I'd like to ask you. Why did you take such a risk in Beijing to phone and get me out? You ever get caught in a honeypot trap, Harry, with a Russian agent? No. Now you're lying. What are you doing? Just in case. Yury's on his way out. The drugs are being loaded. They're yours for the taking. Everything is as I said. It's nice doing business with you, Mr. Palmer. And the surprise? It's all arranged. You've got five minutes to get your friends out of there. I'm glad you're no longer friends of Alex. Just hope the police get here within the next five minutes. Yeah. That truck's about ready to... Uh-oh. I know. I saw him. Keep walking. Surprised? Guess your way out of this. Oh, shit! I thought you were dead. We could all be dead! Yury's working for Kim Soo. This is Kim's revenge. We've got to stop the truck. I'll toss you for it. - Heads or tails? - Heads. You lose. I'll go. Keep me covered. Follow me. Great, Nick. Where the hell are the police? Do you see what I see? Yeah. Gradsky, light a cigar. Are you joking? - I don't want to smoke. - Light a cigar! OK. OK. You're innocent bystanders. Get rid of your guns. And get up slowly. Nobody knows us here. How did he get out of there? - Harry! - What? Get down! What the hell is this? Who are you working for? DEA. - DEA? - DEA? DEA? You got it. I've been trying to bust these guys for two years. Jesus Christ. Get up. Oh. Easy, easy, easy. Ah. - You OK? - Yeah. Look innocent. I'll give it a shot. Look. Now we're in real trouble. That's Alex's car. If you think we're in trouble now, wait till this guy sees me. Mr. Palmer. Do not move. You are under arrest. If they find the heroin, we're all under arrest. Give me your cigar. Run. Run? Mr. Palmer, what are you really doing here in Russia? I told you. I'm a tourist. I came to see my friends, This is, uh, Colonel Gradsky of the KGB. It's all under control, Captain. You are dismissed. Don't break the law. Yes, sir. Nikolai tried to convince me you were dead, but somehow I suspected you'd turn up today. I see you've managed to turn them all against me. No matter. Nothing will deter my course. What are you going to do, kill me? No, not today, Harry. Some other time, maybe. I'm an honourable man. I always pay my debts. Oh, by the way, thank you for saving me the inconvenience of explaining my connection with the harem. Here's your money. Spend it quickly before we meet again. I hope not. Let's go. Nick, take me back to the hotel. But... but you'll miss your flight. No, I'm thinking of staying here in Russia. What for? I don't know, uh, maybe start a business. You're joking. No. There's a... there's a lot of insecurity in this country. And you're going to provide the security? Why not? And what are you going to call this, uh, business? I don't know, uh, the, uh, Tight Fit T-shirt Company. That'd be my security. Maybe Craig and General Gradsky will join me. What about you? Well, Natasha was thinking about going to the States. Yeah, she told me. But she didn't mention you. She didn't? No. Well, I guess I won't be going, then. Anyway, I've... I've been there. I've done that. You want to try for a t-shirt? You got anything in medium? They're tight fit. One size fits all. All right. But on one condition. You tell me the truth about the honeypot trap. So you want to know the truth about the honeypot trap, huh? All right. But tell me, Nick, have you got a mole on the left cheek of your ass? No. Neither have I. We could be related.
