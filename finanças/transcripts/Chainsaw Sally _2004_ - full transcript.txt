(crickets chirping) (soft mysterious music) - [Sally Voiceover] God, I hate to wait. I hate it more than those stupid Girls Gone Crazy commercials that are on late-night TV. Crazy. Those girls don't know from crazy. They should be called Girls Got Drunk and Lost Any Fraction of Dignity and Self-Respect, not Girls Gone Crazy. If they want crazy, they should come here. This town is crazy. If you were to pull back the vinyl siding, the dollar-store curtains and the plastic lawn ornaments in almost half the houses in Porterville, you'd find a world of wickedness. But, fuck it, every town has its dark side, I figure. I was taking care of things just fine on my own, till a few days ago. (clock ticking) - [Stan] Come on, Vickie, how much longer are you gonna be? - I'll be done soon, hon, really I will. - All these reports for school, it's all a buncha bullshit. I never did no reports for school, and look at me. - Yeah, look at you. - You know what? Blow me, Bonnie. I have a job, don't I? - Excuse me, sir. I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to keep your voice down. - Me? They were talking too. - Yeah, if you could keep it down just a little. Thanks. - See what you did not, Bonnie? You got little Miss Frosted Flake all pissed off at me. - No problem, shithead. - Fuck this, I'm getting outta here. - Stan, would you shut up? You're gonna get us all kicked outta here. - You know what? Fuck you too, you little bookworm. Bye, Vick. - Baby, don't go. I'll make it worth your while. - God, Vickie, you're such a doormat. - I got your doormat right here, Bonnie. - Sir, please be quiet in the library. The other patrons are trying to concentrate. I'd appreciate it if you didn't make me come over here again, or I'm afraid I'll have to ask you to leave. - Hey, no problem. I'll keep it down. I'm very quiet. Frigid little freak. (clock ticking) Listen, I gotta take a piss. When I'm done, I am gone ... with or without you. All right? (Stan grumbling) (soft piano music) - That boy'll come to no good. Mark my words. - Well, I hope not. - Well some folks just ain't got no couth like us, Sal. - No, I guess not. - Well, see you, hon. - Have a pleasant afternoon.

(hammer smashing) (group chattering) - Ladies and gentlemen. Ladies and gentlemen, please. Many, many months of planning have gone into this. Now let us not let petty, petty differences impede our progress. This opportunity is being handed to us on a silver platter. - [Sally Voiceover] This is the thorn in my side, the turd in my punchbowl, the piss in my cereal and for now the bane of my very existence. Harvey Fucking Benton. - Now is the time for our humble, charming town to make the proverbial jump into the 21st century. Now, let us show a little respect for our guest. Mr. Benton. - Thank you, Mr. Mayor, my friends and hopefully my new neighbors. Porterville has incredible growth potential. Witness what has happened just in the last six months alone. Phase One is now complete. Affordable, low-cost waterfront condominiums starting in the low 200s, and sales are better than we ever expected. Phase Two is now underway. We are in the process of acquiring the Kellerman property, over 200 acres of nothing that will contain condos and marinas right up to the Porterville waterfront. - This is the part I wanna hear. - Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Phase Three. Benton's Quest. (gasping) Four glorious miles of waterfront property, shopping centers, office buildings, movie theaters, restaurants, nightclubs. Porterville will no longer be that little town that you pass on the way to the shopping centers. Porterville will be the place to go. - What's next, casinos, gambling? - Our taxes will skyrocket. - What about the town? - You'll turn Porterville into Benton's Ghetto. - Ladies and gentlemen, please. Don't you want better opportunities for your children and for your families to thrive? - The children? How will this help? - I couldn't afford to live there. Can you, Mayor? - It'll bring more crime than we've ever had here. (coughing) - You all know me. Born in Porterville. Raised here, schooled here. Make my living here. It was home of my birth pappy and his pappy before him. You're talking about a lot of money, Mr. Benton. Money that I don't see flowing up Main Street into the people's businesses. Into their pockets, for their families. For 67 years, I'd get up with the sun and look outta my window. And for 67 years, the river greeted me. But if you have your way, a year from now, I'll get up in the morning and look out of the window and have this big, ugly, 75-foot-tall silver cock in my face. I hope I won't have to see that. You all know what you have to do. I said my peace. But if you let Mr. Benton and the mayor have their way, they'll swallow you up whole and leave you all in the poor house. A little shaking, a little tenderizing, and they'll eat you alive. Make up your minds. - I ask you to please consider my proposal. Give us another chance to talk after I have the opportunity to speak to Steve Kellerman. - Please, call me Steve. - Thanks, Cynthia. - [Steve] Cynthia. - Well, have a seat. I must admit, you're a very hard man to find, Mr. Kellerman. - Well I travel a lot. - (chuckles) I'm sure you're a very busy man. Business or pleasure? - Both, actually. - Mm, must be nice. I can't remember the last time I left Maryland. - Is that Mr. Benton's offer? - Yes, it is. I'll be honest with you, Mr. Kellerman. I'm surprised you came here in person. Like I said, you're not the easiest man to get a hold of. Your attorneys haven't exactly been very helpful. - Yeah, well. I pay them a lot of money to handle things that I'd rather not handle. And I own a lot of things that I don't even know the half of. Like this property, for instance. - It was willed to you by your late uncle James Kellerman. - I know that much. My people filled me in. - If you're not busy, we could drive out there now and take a look. - That's why I'm here. - Here you go. - Okay, thank you very much. - [Sally Voiceover] Good old Mr. Gordon. He's like a ray of sunshine in this shitty little town. He's been like a father to me. I think. Well, as close as I can figure a father to be like anyway. - Well, hello, Miss Sally. How are you this fine and sunny day? - Hunky dory, Mr. Gordon, and you? - Can't complain. - And even if you did- - Who would listen? - Who would listen? - What can I do you for? We're having a big sale in our gardening section. - Well that sure sounds swell, but all I really need is a new handle for our hammer. - Well I'll be. You musta really been whacking the heck outta something. - Let's see what we've got. - [Harvey] He and Cynthia are together right now, as far as I know. - You think Kellerman'll sell? - Do you know any good reason why he wouldn't? - No. - Besides, there's not a straight man alive who can say no to Cynthia Prescott. - I don't imagine so. - Would you? - Only if I didn't have my little blue pill. - Please, if Cynthia couldn't get you up, no pill could. (laughing) (soft mysterious music) - Well, here we are. (soft mysterious music) The house obviously needs some work, but it's still quite a place. - You aren't kidding. (soft mysterious music) Benton wants to tear this down? - Well Harvey wants to- (phone ringing) Hold on a second. Cynthia Prescott. Oh, hi, Harvey. Yes, I'm showing Mr. Kellerman the property now. Hang on. It's Harvey Benton. He wants to know what time you'd like to meet tomorrow. - You call it. I'm all yours. - Anytime, Harvey. Okay, great, one o'clock it is. See you then. - 200 acres, right down to the waterfront. Any other buildings on the property? - Just the barns we passed on the way in. I'd give you the grand tour but it's getting late, and I'll be honest with you, this place really creeps me out. - Old houses creep you out? - Not old houses. This one. They say that an entire family was attacked and murdered, right before Christmas, about 15 years ago. - [Steve] Murdered, in this house? Swell. - [Cynthia] Legend has it that there were three escaped lunatics from the mental hospital right here in town. They say the men forced their way into the house and shot the man who lived there at point-blank range. He was probably dead before he hit the ground. After killing the man, they found his wife and proceeded to beat and rape her, over and over, so they say. Musta been horrible. No bodies were found. Who knows what they could have done with the family? Some people even say that the lunatics ate them, because all that was found where body parts, blood and traces of semen. - Damn. You said there was a family. Were there children? - I don't know. Some say there were. Others say no. - Jesus. And now I'm the proud owner. Great. - [Cynthia] Well ... that was a long time ago. (mysterious music) - [Sally Voiceover] This is my brother, Ruby. I raised him from a cub, like the wolves did Mowgli in The Jungle Book.

Someone so down to earth. - Down to earth? That's an interesting way of putting it. - Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you feel uncomfortable. - Nah. Me? I'm never uncomfortable. - You bastard.

Who used who? - Man, fuck you. - No no no, see, that was last night. And to hear you brag about it, you know what, you're not all that. If you were, I mighta given you another spin. Hear you talk, I expected sparklers to shoot out your ass. Make love by the rockets red glare, but you know what, in reality, you're nothing special. You're just another backseat pit stop. - Welcome to Porterville. - I've had enough entertainment for one night. How about you? - You ready to get outta here? - [Steve] Let's roll. - Oh, hey wait. Do you mind if, when we get back to your room, I can come up and get those papers that we need for the meeting with Harvey tomorrow? I can get Pat to make copies. - Sounds like a plan. - Okay.

I think you should let me buy you a drink. - What about your girlfriend? - Well, I'm already wearing hers, and she ain't my girlfriend. She's a mental case. - And how do you know I'm not a mental case? - I can tell, babes. You got your shit together. There ain't nothing wrong with a girl like you. - This is it. Here we are. - I just love this place. - Here you go. - Oh, great. I'll have Pat get on these first thing in the morning. - Well, thanks for a very entertaining evening. Floor show and all.

She used to do that walking against the wind shit. It was fantastic. She was a very flexible girl. - I bet she was. - Don't encourage him. - No, it was awesome, really. She was double-joined too. She used to do things to blow your mind. She'd get a, tie a knot in a cherry stem with her tongue. - Pfft, I could do that. - I'll give you $10 if you can do that right now. - Hell yeah. (upbeat music) (muffled music) - Ruby, I'm home. - Well it's about time. My supper's almost ruined. Did you bring groceries? Could you get drinks? That blonde lady was back up at the house again today. You know, the one that has the pointy titties. Her and some guy that I didn't know. - Shit, why didn't you say something? - I just did. - That's Cynthia Prescott. That bitch is gonna be trouble. - Right here in River City? - No, Harvey Fucking Benton, that's what kinda trouble. He's been building and building and working his way towards us like a swarm of locusts. He's about to be knocking on our front door. Little Miss Barbie Doll is his calling card. - Well, fuck a furry duck. - Ruby, don't talk like that. You should never fuck farm animals. It'll rot your Twinkee off and make you smell funny. You don't want that, do you? Now come on, let's eat. Don't get your panties in a bunch. I'll find out more about it tomorrow. Don't worry, I'll take care of it. You just keep an eye out for Cynthia. Ugh, oh, we better get the groceries off the porch first. (crickets chirping) - Um, what'd you do with his, um ... pee pistol? - Oh. - Thanks. (dramatic music on TV) - I believe it's well hung anyway. For until then, I am Count Gore de Vol. - [Sally Voiceover] I wonder how many late-night horror movies we've watched on that couch. I can't even remember the last time I fell asleep in my own bed. I love Ruby. He's my family, at least all that's left. But he really needs to bathe more often. (vehicles passing) - Excuse me, I was wondering if you could point me in the direction of your town's newspapers and periodicals. - Of course, sir, follow me. (clock ticking) Here we are. All these papers are organized by date. If you need a more extensive collection, you'll need to go to our main branch. - Thanks. Excuse me. You'll pardon me for asking, but are you? - Am I what? - Are you, um? Nothing, nothing. - Very well, sir. Please let me know if I can be of any more assistance. - Thanks.

But I had to kill them, baby, to protect you and Ruby. I had to. An eye for an eye. Those were bad men. - Why, Daddy, why? - I'm so sorry, baby. If I had, had just. (soft mysterious music) Take care of your brother, like we took care of you. - Daddy. - You gotta take care of him. He can't. - Daddy, don't. Daddy! (soft piano music) - Mr. Kellerman, so nice to finally meet you. Please, come in and have a seat. Cynthia, please. - Thanks, Mr. Benton. I have heard a lot about you. - (chuckles) All good things, I'm sure. But please, call me Harvey. All my good friends call me Harvey. - Thanks. And please also call me Steve. When I hear Mr. Kellerman, I start looking for my dad. (laughing) You look like a man with something on his mind. - Always. Always something on my mind. And I bet you can tell me what that is. - Money. - Money? Good answer, one of my favorites, but no, not this time. I think about the future, and how I can mold that future. That's what I'm about, Steve. What about you? - Well, at the moment, I'm thinking about how you will grow and mold my future. - I like that. A straight shooter, right from the hip, that's a good thing. Hmm. You know, I'm in the position to make you a very rich man. Wealthier than your wildest dreams. - I don't know, I can dream pretty big. - I bet you do dream big, but I am the person who got those hill jacks to take their cars off blocks in their front yards, and I am the person who got people to go out and do something other than cash a welfare check. And I'm the person who can take this two-bit, piece-of-shit town, and turn it into the community that it should be. That's me, Steve. Now what about you? - Hell, I wanna move in right now. Maybe I should hold on to my land and see what happens. - Why would you wanna stay here? Aren't there greener pastures for you? I mean, what are you gonna do, just sit around and watch those weeds grow? - But you just said. - But, you know what I said. And you know what I mean. Mr. Kellerman, Steve, I think we both know why you're here. - Yeah, yeah, we do. So ... let's get down to business. - Let's get down to business. You've got 200 acres that divides Porterville in half, and I'm the person that can pull that town together. I've written down a nice, tidy little sum. I think once you try this on, you're going to see that it makes a very nice feet. (soft music) (chuckling) - It's a very big number. Mr. Benton, it was a pleasure to meet you. Cynthia, I'll be in touch. - You're leaving? - I have a lot to think about. You'll have my answer in 24 hours. (soft music) - 24 hours, my ass. That pinprick little shit, he's just sitting around waiting for me to raise my offer. He thinks he's gonna sit here and wait for my balls to start sweating, I don't think so. You better get an autograph on that contract, or shit is gonna hit the fan. Cyn, you do whatever it takes. And I mean whatever. (crickets chirping) - Hi. I was doing some research on some old articles, and it looks like some things are missing. - Missing? That's impossible. - Well you might wanna have a look because it looks like somebody's taken the scissors to your files. (clock ticking) (soft music and vocalizing) - Why do some people have to destroy everything? I'm so sorry, sir. - Steve. - Look, if you need any help with your research, I'll be happy to do what I can. It's never very busy in here on the weekdays, so. - Thanks, that'd be great. - So, what are you looking for? - Well have you ever heard of that story about the old house up on Route 40? The one where the family was murdered? - Murdered? Oh my God, when? - Oh no no no no no, this was like 15 years ago or so. Three escaped mental patients. - Yeah, everyone in Porterville's heard that story, but I don't think it's really true. I mean, I've been living here all my life and I've never seen any proof of it. It's just one of those- - Town stories? - Exactly. I think you may be chasing a fairy tale. - Well, maybe so, but ... somehow it interests me. Would you mind pointing me in the right direction? - Sure, I'd be happy to. And if I can't, I'm sure that George can. - Oh, uh, George. Hey, um. Is he, um? You know, is he? - Oh no, he's just a little effeminate, that's all. (clock ticking) (screaming) (chainsaw roaring) (screaming) (dramatic music) - Ruby. - [Ruby] What? - She didn't twist her ankle like that in the movie. You're thinking of the ones with Jason. - No I'm not. I'm doing Jamie Lee in Halloween. (high-pitched squealing) - Why do you always have to mix up the movies? - I'm not mixing it up. I like to add my own artistic license. Hey, I'm thinking about taking a shower. Do you wanna play Norman? - Nah. How about a game of Twister? - Okay. But wait, all we have is left hands and feet. - That's okay. We'll just cut the thumbs off a couple of rights. - Okay. - Want me to make some popcorn? - [Ruby] Sure. - [Sally Voiceover] Cut the thumbs off a couple of rights? That made sense. Actually, I wouldn't have minded playing Norman with Ruby, but since he's older, it's gotten kinda weird. (clock ticking) - Hey, it's five o'clock. It's about time for me to lock up. - Really? Oh man, time flies. Thanks for all your help today. - I don't know how much help I was. I mean, we didn't find anything. - Good night, Sally, Mr. Kellerman. - Night, George. - Good night. (door closing) Anyway, you were great. Hey, let me return the favor. I saw a little ice cream shop down the street. Wanna have some with me? - Uh, sure, that'd be nice. Let me get my things and I'll meet you by the front door. (clock ticking) - Hey, isn't that that rich guy that owns all that property? - Where? - Right there, with the librarian. - Him? He's rich? - Yep, worth millions. I saw him yesterday, and he was driving a hummer. - I got a hummer for him. What the shit is he doing with her? My customer. - Geez, ho. - Oh. I'll have a small chocolate shake. - A small chocolate shake please, and I'll have a chocolate banana malt. - A malt? You mean, a shake? - Yeah, it's a shake with malt in it. You have malt on the menu. - Yeah, okay, got it. - You spell malt with an A not an O. - I think I know how to spell malt. That's 4.75, good-looking. (muffled upbeat music) Here you go. - [Steve] Thanks. - You know, I get off in about an hour, if you wanna buy me some ice cream. - Thanks, but I got plans already. - Yeah, I see that.

Tonight is a really good one. - He's showing toolbox murders. It's one of our favorites. - So, in honor of tonight's presentation, we're going to play a little game. It's called. - Da da da na! - Toolbox Murders, the Home Game. So long, Mr. Man. Stop it. Stop it. Don't be such a baby. You know, I don't know what your problem is. You've got the easy part. Just sit there on your fat ass. You know, like you always do. (muffled screaming) (dramatic music) (muffled screaming) (blade whirring) (muffled screaming) Now that didn't take very long, did it? - Nope. Another hour and 53 minutes to go. (muffled crying) - Now this will really solve your inchworm problem. I guarantee you, once they get this, there won't be one of them more than half an inch long. - Hi, Mr. Gordon. - Hello, my dear. - And how are you today? - Well I can't complain, and even if I did- - Who would listen? - Who would listen? - Well I would, Mr. G, you know that. - I know you would. So, what can I do you for today, Sally? - I thought I'd take a look at that gardening sale you were talking about, is it still on? - Sure is, right back in there. - [Sally] Thanks. - I'll be back to help you in a moment. Is that okay, hon? - Okay. - All right. (upbeat music) (mysterious music) (muffled speaking) - [Sally] Daddy! - [Sally Voiceover] So, we packed up everything we could haul in our wagon and moved it all into a trailer someone had started converting into a house back in the woods. It took a few trips, but we got everything we needed. No one knew we were back there, and the trailer was well in the center of our property. There wasn't even a road to it. Just what was left of a path. - I guess you do have some serious gardening to do. - Just got some things that need clearing away from the house. (soft music) (upbeat music) (muffled music) - [Sally] Ruby, I'm going out soon. How's it going down there? (muffled music) - Almost done. (muffled music) Can I go out tonight? - No, not tonight, I got something I gotta do. - [Ruby] Steve? - No, I'm not going to do Steve. Not tonight anyway. But I am gonna be bringing someone home, so make sure it's presentable down there, okay? - I will. Bossy butt. (muffled music) (crickets chirping) (door closing) (engine starting) (car passing) (knocking on door) - I was on my way out to dinner, and I hate to eat alone.

Not before dessert. Not on pity fuck night! (upbeat dance music) (muffled crying) (upbeat dance music) - Late night last night? - Yes, I'm sorry it was. How are you today? - Fine. Fine. Could I get a cup of that? - Sure, hang on, I'll get you some. What do you take in it? - Cream and sugar. - More research today? - Yeah, well, maybe. I don't know. It has been a very strange few days. - That's funny. I didn't think much of anything strange happened in Porterville. - Huh, well there is more strangeness here than you may be aware of. You just might be the most normal person in this town. - That's funny. - Here's what I don't get. Why is Harvey Benton so interested in that land? Check that, I mean, I know why he is. Why is he so obsessed with it? The price he offered me is three times what it's really worth. What is he planning to do with that land? - Land? What land are you talking about? The farm you've been researching? - Yeah. That's my property. I thought you knew that. - No, I guess I didn't. How could I have been so stupid? - What does that mean? - Nothing. So what do you think you're going to do? - I don't know. I'm tempted to just sell him the land and get the hell out of Dodge. What about you? You live here. Do you wanna see the land developed? (door opening and closing) - Hey there, stranger. - Hey. How are you? - Great, you? - Fine, slept like a baby. - I could tell. Glad I could help (chuckles). So, are you free for lunch today? - Yeah, sure, what time? - Why don't you come up to my office, say, noonish? - Okay. I'll see you then. - Great. Until then. (soft dramatic music) - So, I didn't know if you'd want this or not, but over in the main branch I had them pull some articles for you on the property. You know, if you're still interested. - Oh yeah, I am. Oh, that's great. (soft dramatic music) - I told them you'd be up tomorrow afternoon sometime, so they said they'd have the articles ready for you by then. - That's perfect. Thanks so much. - Sure, it was nothing. Oh, and while you're here, I'll get a printout of a map so you can find the library tomorrow. - Thanks again. - George, do you mind kind of watching things out here? I need to make a private phone call in the back. - Oh sure, take your time. - Thanks. - No problem, hon. (clock ticking) - Oh my goodness. - I have a delivery here for Miss Prescott. - I'll take those. (bright music) Here you go. - [Delivery Man] Thanks a lot, have a nice day. - [Pat] Cynthia, guess what you got. - Who are they from? - I don't know. Here's the card. (bright music) - Hm. - Steve? Hello? Anybody home? Hello? Steve? (soft mysterious music) Hello? (gasping) Sally? What are you doing here? - Well, waiting for you, of course. - Waiting for me. Why, did we have an appointment? - Sort of. I just have some loose ends that need tying up. - What are you talking about? - Didn't you get the flowers? - Flowers? - Yes, the flowers I sent. Oh, did you think they came from Steve? - You sent those? - I guess I shoulda signed the card Sally instead of S. - Look, you little bitch. You have no right to be here. You have no right to lead me here under false pretenses. And you have no right to even look at a rich man like Steve. He can buy and sell you and your whole damn family. He may give you a quick twirl around the dance floor and a couple bounces on the mattress, but as soon as he throws you the towel, it's over. You know it, and I know it. So take my advice and fuck off before I call the cops. - Oh, Cynthia, I don't think you'll turn me in. - Oh yeah. Who's gonna stop me? (chainsaw roaring) (screaming) (chainsaw roaring) (upbeat dramatic music) (groaning) (upbeat dramatic music) (whimpering) (dramatic music) (screaming) - [Pat] Hello, hello? Cynthia, this isn't funny. Somebody please pick up the phone. Can you hear me? Please pick up the phone. This isn't funny. Hello? (chainsaw idling) - Excuse me. Excuse me, Miss. Do you know anything about this cable running back into the woods? Is there a house back there? Because if it is, that's a federal offense. Somebody's been stealing cable. Holy shit, what happened to you? (chainsaw buzzing) - Send me the bill. (phone ringing) - Yes, Cynthia. - Oh, hello. No, Mr. Benton, this is Pat, Pat Hingle, Cynthia's personal assistant. - Yes, Pat, what can I do for you? - Well Cynthia has asked me to call you and let you know that Mr. Kellerman is ready to close the deal, and he will be at his farmhouse at seven PM. And she would like to know if you can make it. - Yes, that's great news. Thank you very much. And definitely tell Cynthia that I'll be there. - Okay, fine, bye-bye now. (laughing) Okay, sh. (laughing) - Sh, sh. (soft mysterious music) - Yeah, Pat, I can be there, but I'm in town now and it'll be after dark by the time I get there. - I'm sure that's fine. I'll let her know. Thank you, Mr. Kellerman. (laughing) Nine one one? I'd like to report a murder. (crickets chirping) (knocking on door) - This is the police. Open up. (knocking on door) This is the police, Mr. Kellerman. Open up, we have a warrant. All right, this scumbag wants to play tough, I can play tough. - Holy shit on a stick. What kind of crazy Ed Gein wannabe is this Kellerman wacko? Would you look at this, ew, shit, oh. - [Zeke] Hey, check this out. Looks like this punk's taken an interest in our town history. - Oh, he thinks he's Kolchak, huh? Well, bet you he's feeling like a dog in the ass now. God musta gone and made him just about as stupid as He could, and then peed all over him. (mysterious music) - Ho, I got a door here. (door creaking) Oh my God, Earl. Is that? - It's the ice cream girl. Sweetest piece of ass in the whole damn town, and this guy had to go and lop it off and dump it into a bathtub. What kinda of a sick son of a bitch would do something like that? - Melinda, this is Zeke. We're gonna need some state boys out here. This is one seriously troubled man. - Troubled? Nah, troubled's being a couple of months late on your truck payment. This is the kinda guy that would put on his granny's bra and panties and whack off with some Crunchy Jif into a turkey potpie. (crickets chirping) - [Sally Voiceover] Waiting. I can't stand waiting. Here I sit brokenhearted, came to shit but only farted. Goddam how I hate to have to wait for these assholes. All this mess, and over what? A piece of land that was never theirs to begin with. Oh well, no skin off my ass. I just want them to get here soon, because at nine o'clock wrestling comes on. And I don't wanna miss any of it. Wait a sec. Finally. (dramatic drumming music) (soft dramatic music) (nail gun firing) - What the hell is that doing here? (soft dramatic music) (crickets chirping) (upbeat dramatic music) - Hey, you big fucking thief, put it back! (screaming) - Better call on someone who knows you, Harvey. (upbeat dramatic music) (nail gun firing) - My fucking feet, goddammit! (nail gun firing) (Harvey screaming) (nail gun firing) Goddammit, don't fucking touch me! (nail gun firing) (Harvey screaming) (nail gun firing) Goddammit, someone stop this fucking gun. Oh my God, you son of a bitch! (Harvey screaming) (chainsaw idling) - Sally? Please. What did he do to deserve that? - He's a bad man. I have to kill him. I have to protect my family. That's what I do. - It was you. Your family. In this house, the story. Cynthia told it. - Help me! - You lay here. (chainsaw revving) Here. Call for help. Call the cops. - Call the cops? - Yeah, come on, Bruce Wayne, save the day. I want you to. - Why do you want me to? - Because if you don't, I'm gonna cut this pig's head off. (whimpering) Call them, motherfucker! (dramatic music) - I need help. I wanna report a murder. No, I wanna report a buncha murders. There's no time to get into that now. Just. I don't think they believe me. (Harvey screaming) No! (Harvey screaming) (chainsaw roaring) (dramatic music) I'm not afraid of you. I don't believe you're gonna kill me. I don't believe you're gonna cut me with that saw. - That's good, because you're right. I'm not gonna kill you, Steve. I couldn't kill you. (chainsaw banging) (dreamy music) - Oh man. Ugh. - Freeze! (soft dramatic music) (groaning) Don't you move a muscle! - There he is. It's Norman Bates. And all his singalong friends. Boy, it looks like you been shitting down one leg and wiping it with the other. Go on, Zeke, just shoot him now, just shoot him now. - When I tell you to, I want you to lay down, slowly. Easy. (dreamy music) - No, look, you've got it wrong. - You have the right to remain silent, and I suggest you do so. You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford one, one will be provided for you. - Look, I know what you must think, but you got it all wrong. - I'm sure I do, Mr. Gacy. Well don't piss down my back and tell me that it's raining. Now kiss the floor, Leatherface! - Yeah, well we got an anonymous tip leading us to his, uh, Steve Kellerman's hotel room. And it was about that time that we figured out that he might not be up, might not be up to any good. So we took it upon ourselves to do a little investigating. And it brought us to this place here, and we found that bastard. Hopefully, he'll be brought to justice, you know. Have to play a little butt bingo with Bubba down at the penitentiary. (laughing) - Sucker. (laughing) - Oh that was good. (chainsaw revving) Oh I love this. This is my favorite. - A toast to those two guys. - Tits and ass.
