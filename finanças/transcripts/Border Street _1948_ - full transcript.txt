Streets changed into cemeteries. Ruins and burned down. So many of them in Warsaw. The action of the film takes place on one such street. Let us call it Border Street, although it could as well be called Bielawska, Dluga, or Swietokrzyska. We do not intend to determine its real name. We do intend only to show a small fragment of its history, of the history of its poor inhabitants, little people, children, or practically children... 1939... Who does not remember... Father, mommy told that you... Bronek, Fred's got a new ball! Come! What did mommy say? Miss Clara, shall we stop? I have an appointment with my friends... Let the little Jew bathe once in his life... The little Jew won't bathe himself. We must help him... Leave him, what do you want from the boy? Maybe you will bathe with him? Why did he take my ball? It's all wet. Well, boys let's go. I won't let you play with my ball any longer you'll spoil it entirely. Bronek, throw it here! Jadzia, hold it! Oh, my goodness, what is happening here? It is shocking. These camps... your friends... Very little would have killed me. Oh, how dirty it is! And you, you laugh! Oh, I'll show you how to play ball, break flower pots, kill people. I must put an end to such kind of play. Please, give me the ball. It's my ball, Miss Clara, but it wasn't I who did it. What? What? Fred, listen, not one word who did this. If he dares... Well boys, the only out is to go ask for the ball. The daughter of a doctor, of a good family, my pupil, plays ball with the boys, climbs the roofs, used to go, and sit in the stables for hours, and friends, everywhere friends... Well did you come to pay for the flower pot? We came to ask for the ball. To ask for the ball... Above all who has done it? Who has broken such a pretty flower pot? Kiks, Miss Clara, Kiks. It isn't a person, it's a major force, for instance... you intend to make a goal, and you break a pot instead, itâ€™s just a kiks. Is it kiks, or not, never mind, the ball will stay here. Why do you ask them such things? They are friends and don't betray one another. The ball will therefore stay here. I'll tell you who has done it. Jadzia! I? It was my fault? Yes. She was standing at the window and asked Bronek to kick the ball up to her. And he did it! Oh, you traitor! Jadzia, how are you behaving? My ball. I want to have my ball back... What is happening here? Oh Doctor, what a trouble. Dad, I'll tell you everything. My friends... Well, well, you can tell me later, now I have my patients and quick, Children, Miss Clara. Please take them off... It's what I've told them. Take your ball and clear away... Are you racing on the staircase? No, Father, we're just playing. Stop it and come home for lunch. Will you have some more soup? No, thank you, my dear. You are overworked. Recently, you have too much work at the bank. It has been such a fuss today. People say the war will break out and want their money from the banks. The war, father? So schools will be closed. Wladek, eat and don't poke your nose everywhere. The war won't course, break out. Hitler will never dare. The Jews only encourage such gossip to make better business. Dad, you know, little Davidek bathed in a washing tub. Davidek is not a right friend for you. I've told you not to play with such dirty children. Oh, drop it. Little Davidek is a good child although he is Jewish. These Liberman are decent people, the old tailor and his son-in-low, the electrician. Good morning. What's new, Nathan? Nothing - why is Davidek in bed? Why is he in bed? I have told him many times to stay at home and learn like other Jewish children. And what does he do? He plays ball... He was nearly drowned in a washing tub and is now getting dry. Why, he is but a child. What does it matter that he has gotten wet a little and played ball? In my time learning the Talmud was deemed much more important than kicking ball. In your times, father-in-law, there was not electricity, and Jewish electricians like me did not exist. And they were not less wise than you are. Do you know, Grandpa, that Jadzia the doctor's daughter, plays ball with the boys? Because she is a Polish child... I am no more a child and won't agree to be treated like one. Your behavior proved something to the contrary. How can a grown up girl box a Restaurateur's son's ears? - a pub owner's son, Miss Clara. Because she's a doctor's daughter, she may beat him? Look how his face has swollen but you do nothing, because she is the daughter of the doctor, and they have a 5 room flat... Jadzia, come. Where to? To the parking lot, to Cieplikowski, will you? I would go very willingly, but I cannot. Miss Clara has locked me in. That is very easy; you can get out this way. Hello, Jadzia my congratulations because of Fred. You are a wonderful friend... Bronek! Bronek! Well. Let's go. Wladek take the oats, and I'll go to my mother to take my father's dinner. Bronek, hurry up! I'm ready mommy. Don't linger along the way for the food will turn quite cold. All right. Father, I brought you dinner. Father, it will be cold. Pea soup with smoked bacon, a delicious dream. Reality and not a dream. How are you children? Good morning. Oh, our doctor's daughter, good morning. Father, shall I give the oats to the horse? All right. It must drink first, it is so hot. Oh, yes. I would gladly drink something too, but not water a man isn't a horse, is he? Please. What is that? Have it. Father told me to buy it everyday, it is very good for one's health, and it is kefir. Kefir? Hold the canteen cup. It looks nicely bottle shaped. Let us taste it, since a nice, pretty girl asks. Delicious, isn't it? With pea soup? Eh, what is the kefir. A mad cow's milk. Baska where are you going? Ask, Bronek, ask... All right. Father, can we take Jadzia for a drive? She is such a brave friend, Well. I have no passengers. Let's go to Wilanow. Go, Baska. Oh, kefir. Sir, take me to your cab. The barrel organ is so heavy today, and it is so hot. Look, what a beautiful parrot! Help the old, children; we are going to have a radio built on a wringer basis. Pay attention that you do not lose your green cock. It is not a cock; it is a parrot that tells fortunes. Oh, yes, I know. Thirty years ago, in Bielany a white mouse said I should marry a blonde girl and be happy. Well, it became true. I married. Dad, is mommy blonde? And am I happy? Lora, tell the young miss her fortune. This one... no. This one... No. This one... Look two rings. How lovely. Fortune - telling. Monday is the luckiest day for you"... Do you hear, boys? You receive two rings, one to keep for yourself, and give the other to a person with blonde hair and blue eyes... Miss, you should always obey the foretoken. There is something more there: " for this has been..." this is not important. No, no it is important as this person been chosen to marry you"... Then let us go and ask the doctor if he agree to his daughter marriage. Go, Baska. Come in. Good morning, doctor, Good morning. Sit down. What is wrong? My heart aches, doctor. Your heart... Jadzia? I am a patient. Well, what is wrong? My heart aches for my father never has any time for me. I am always alone, and if I go somewhere there is a big scandal. Miss Clara is a very good for you as though she were your mother. Oh, good, why then does she always scold me like a little child? How could you beat this boy? What is that? The third test alarm today? Do you hear, dad? They make the test alarms so often now. Unfortunately these are not test alarms... Listen, Wladek. I must join the army. You will be now the only man in the family. Mommy is ill; I don't know how to tell her. My goodness, the war. I felt it would break out. Reserve officers have to report to their units immediately. Wladek, get my battle dress from the closet. I thought I wouldn't need it until Army Days. The war won't last long. You'll see, in two months I'll be back. Remember, I spoke to you like a man. You now have to look after our family. I still have to drop into the hairdresser's. Well good bye, Wladek. I'll go with you. All right, come along. Good morning. Excuse me, may I go first. I am in a great hurry. I cannot let you go first, I am in hurry too. My father is in hurry because he is going to the Army. Such is their patriotism. A polish officer is going to war and the Jews are in hurry. Father, people say the war will break out. Are they mad? War! Nonsense! Attention, an alarm in Warsaw is being announced. Shall we go home father? Did you fall off this horse? Look, the sun is shining, the sky is blue. There will be no war. Let us go home. They march bloody dogs, and they march well. Let them march all the way to the hell. They have stolen me and my horse. I am discharged. Hold it. Cut it this way more. Why do I need such a long mustache? I've always clipped you so. And now you will do it another way. The times have changed. Give me the comb. Oh... you now look like... Heil Hitler! Please, please, Oh, you can speak German. I am not Polish, I am German. My mother is Hilda Birkenmajer of Dresden, and my father is of Leipzig. So you are of German origin. Sit down, please. Thank you. Are you hungry, little dog? So pretty... A pretty dog. Trained? Rolf, come here. Rolf, listen, Jew... Jew... It does not like Jews, does it? No, it does not Rolf, where is the Jew? Uncle Nathan has returned. Szulek... Good God, what have they done to him... Nathan! Uncle Nathan, did you see Hitler? Now they will ask a thousand questions. Let him rest, he is tired. Nathan, will they make ghetto? They will. People in our P.O.W. camp were saying the same. They will make a ghetto. Maybe it will be better for the Jews to be separate. If the Germans organize a ghetto it is not in order to do better. But in Ghetto, we shall all be equal. Oh yes, they will exterminate all of us equally. Don't you see? They intend to separate us from the Poles it will be much easier to exterminate the Poles and the Jews separately. It is their policy. I heard the P.O.W. camp people saying that we should be together, and struggle. Struggle? Who? You? My son-in-law? Jewish electrician? He will got to fight... you have fought enough. Hmm, Hitler laughs at you. What will you fight with? Your bare hands? Yes, with our bare fists. The Poles will surely fight and we shall go with them. I shall fight with the German's too. You have one more warrior. Nathan is right, father. Hush! Oh, my head! What do you want of me? Go and fight, go and fight. Victory, victory. The Jews are guilty of everything. So it is, father-in-law. I have got such an awful headache. Ester, make me a dressing bolster, please. I have no vinegar. Davidek go to Kusmirak's and buy a bottle of vinegar. Good morning. A bottle of vinegar, please. What are you doing here? I wish to buy a bottle of vinegar. Take of your cowl. Hurry up! Father the little Jew has come to buy vinegar. Let him wait. Bring it to Mr. Hans. Fuhrer is right. The Jews are guilty of everything. No, Hans. Yes, yes. Mr. Hans. What? There is a Jew there. Where? Rolf, a Jew! Goodness, a dog! The Germans shall not despise us or Germanize our children The history of the Polish Nation has known many examples of songs. Sometimes these authors were poets as in this case, sometimes quite unknown common people... We now have such a song. We sing it and don't know who its author is. Well, Bronek, I have asked you to be serious. You are certainly going to tell me it was "Kiks" who created it. I am serious. Just listen. Boys, let us sing. Jadzia play the "Children of Warsaw"... The windows should be shut. Take arms, Warsaw children, and go to fight. We shall fight for every one of you stones. Warsaw dear, when you order us, we shall Gladly give our blood. Every house, every one of us in any part of the city is ready to go and fight for you, Warsaw dear! We should open... Children, hide away your books. Why does the servant not open the door? Oh, doctor... Helen. You see not everybody who rings the door bell is the Gestapo. I've just seen the police. They arrive in your street. Miss Clara, my brother-in-law is so. I'll go to the door, and if they go upstairs. I'll give a sign. Does Wojtan live here? ...And not here either. I've found him! He lives here. They went to us. There is only Mommy and the girl at home. I have to go. Well, where is Casmir Wojtan? As I have told you, in P.O.W. camp. Here you can see a letter he wrote to me. Only, when did you receive it? One month ago and now he does not write, does he? Damned bandit, he has fled from the camp. Fled? Who is he? He is my son. Your son? And where is your father? I don't know. Remember then if we don't find your father, we'll take you, and your mother, everybody. Fled? I think they are gone. Well? What did they want? My father is free now; he has fled from the P.O.W. camp. They came for a control, but they won't find him... They won't find him... Oh my goodness! Cook, bring any cakes we have to the dining room! We have prepared a song of the Germans. The German have just been in this house. They could come here and make a control. What then? I have all my papers in order. Your cousin was saying the same, but during yesterday's control they found a letter, learned everything, and he has vanished. What am I to do? I repeat once more: look up everything. I'll help you. In our times one isn't too cautious. Think if somebody knew it, what a tragedy for Jadzia. She must not know anything. These old family photographs are not important. Look... Good God; if some enemy of yours caught it, you would have been afraid. Tear it to pieces immediately. Dad, Auntie - come honor captain Wojtan with us. My father has fled from a P.O. W camp. We beg you, please come. Later you can miss your cakes. We shall come a little later; we have to talk about some important matters. Come with us come, We must honor Captain Wojtan. He is like Dr Bialek. Maybe his father, maybe his grandfather... Like Dr Bialek? Agreed. But he is a Jew, you can clearly see. Quite right. So you suppose? No, it is impossible everybody in the house know this. Let us wait unit Davidek comes and reads it to us. Here is Davidek. Come here, you will read us something, and then you shall get some sweets. He is afraid of Rolf. Come, Rolf is not here today. Sit down and put your cap on. Can you read this? Why not? It is Hebraic. Read it. It means in Polish: To my dear grandson Joseph. Grandfather Jehuda Bialer. Nothing more? No, I read everything. You may go. Give him some sweets. Well was he right? What has our Dr Bialek to do with a Bialer? Bialer... Bialer... I have an idea. Come here, I'll show you something. The grandfather's name was Bialer, the grandson put a fine here, and there and what is the grandson's name now? Dr Bialek... Bialek... you mean? The doctor once changed his name, and he changed it to Aryan. But not for me, doctor. So he will have to go to the Ghetto, and Jadzia too? And their beautiful flat will be ours. Eat, children it is our last Sabbath at home. We shall be in the Ghetto next week. I have lived in this poor room for thirty years. I have worked my whole life. When I had no work, I had no bread to eat, when I worked, I had no time to eat. And now they expel us. Our sins should have been very great, and we're being terribly punished. Children, children, terrible times are coming for the Jews... Not only for the Jews. Kazik! I've fled from the camps. I know it. The police made a control here, everything was quite upside down. How are the children? Where is Wladek? Dad! You look like a grow up man, my son. He is now the head of the family, he earns our living. I smuggle anything I can meat, flour potatoes. The girls are never hungry. Look. I'll wake them. Don't do it. I must go soon. They organize a man hunt so often now. Wladek, hide here and guard them. You can count on me, Father. Give mommy my old suit, my papers are in order, I need only the battle dress. Don't be angry, Kazik but we needed money to start Wladek's business, I sold your suit. How much did you earn on it? May I earn on it? We're neighbors... say... I won't take anything free... Especially from a Jew, eh? I'll make a reckoning with your wife. She won't hurt me. Hide it well, it is dangerous. Dangerous. It's dangerous to live now, but we do. I'll make a suit of this, and we're even. Good bye. God Bless you, sir. Look, Jews live here. Really, Jews go. It's Sabbath. Flat, bread, fish and wine. Jewish Sit down! Father Christmas, where are your diamonds? Diamonds? We are poor people. Oh, yes, Jews are always poor, but they have diamonds, only hidden. No, no, no, You damned Jewish pack! Come here, Jew, come. What is that? Who does it belong to? I sewed it before the war for an officer. Where is the officer? I don't know. Hands up! To the wall! Do you know now? Where is the officer, where does he live? I don't know. I don't know... You damned Jew. I shall kill you! Please, Mr. Cieplikowski, we were neighbors for thirty years... Wait we have time to say good bye. Your belongings are still here. What are you going to the Ghetto, too, Mr. Cieplikowski? Neither to Ghetto nor to Berlin Herr Kusmirak. Eh, eh, sir... What sir? Why are you reproaching me? Because I am helping my neighbors? One helps, one will be helped another time. I will drop the smuggle. I will suggest to my father, sell his cab and buy a rickshaw"... Would your father drive a rickshaw? No, I would drive it. My father said that until the Germans are in Warsaw, he would not lift a finger and somebody must earn some money right? Hello boys, come and see the Libermans move to Ghetto. Bye, bye Davidek. Be brave. They go behind a wall, hunger and contempt await them... Not only Germans live in the world. Eh partner, shall we sell them something? I smuggle only for my people. I shall not run the risk for Jews. Why do you dislike them so much? One has pity of them. My father does not like them either. Excuse me, I entered because you did not ask anybody in for such a long time. Never mind, sit down, please. I'll walk little while if you don't mind. Of course not. Well, how is you rheumatism? Very painful? Did the injections help you? How do I know? Besides, you've told me that no medicines would help me until I moved out of my small and wet rooms. Naturally, your lodging is fatal. Such lodging would be suitable for my health would it not? Of curse it would be the best medicine for you. I have come to you for such a medicine. What do you mean, Mr. Kusmirak? Well. I mean the medicine is your lodging. I am a delicate man, but... to make the matter clear you will have in any case to leave this lodging and I shall take it. I shall have to leave this lodging? You still cannot understand me Mr. Bialer? Oh, I beg you pardon Dr. Bialer-Bialek. It is so easy to say erroneously... please. I see now Mr. Kusmirak. Don't be angry with me Doctor, but had my daughter Wanda and her boyfriend Hans, come to settle this matter, it would have ended much worse... What is the matter? Great lodging it's settled. So we must have brandy. Certainly! I congratulate you. Good health Father Kasmirak! I am Jewish do you see? I must go to Ghetto. How very dreadful! A man like you... But you can hide like the others. I'll help you. No, I cannot. You must. The war is going on now, everybody has to fight. I cannot fight with blackmail, I will not be able to hide... You must, Jadzia will wish to go with you, if she finds out, she loves you so much. Jadzia must not learn anything. Miss Clara please help me, we must tell a lie. She must leave on the first train to the country, to Aunt Helena. You don't even know how much I hate the idea parting from you. I feel something dreadful will happen to you. Don't you know the police are searching for Capt Wojtan? I am a reserve officer, too and have to vanish from Warsaw. You can take me with you. You know it is impossible. I am sure you will be happy at Aunt Helen's. Good bye Doctor, good bye Do you know everything? I do. It is the fault of those vile Kusmiraks. Poor Jadzia. I don't pity her, that impudent liar. How can you say that? Hasn't she cheated, didn't she pretend to be Polish? Look, she wrote me that her father is An officer like mine. Impudent. You should understand her position. We must help her. Leave me, you go with her. How vile you are. Oh I must tell Jadzia to beware of you... you..., oh... Tell it to her when you see her, and give it to her... You know, Wladek, we were friends, but it must have been a long time ago... Wladek... Dad... Are you in Warsaw now? Sit down. Wait, Wladek. I'll ask first. How is mommy? She is better now, but she was sick a long time. The girls are better now but their apetite are too great for war time. You say mother is better. Do you continue to smuggle with Bronek as a partner? I have quarreled with Bronek. He has a rickshaw now and stands at the corner there. Davidek, hold it, Davidek. Bronek, nobody is allowed to approach us, be careful. Davidek, how are you getting along? Bad, there's hunger and typhoid fever. I go to work instead of my grandfather. Take it and eat. So many children steel through the walls. Come some time, we shall think about what can be done. Run away, Bronek, a policeman is coming, shall try to come tomorrow evening. I'll wait in the cab shed. How is Jadzia? We have quarreled, over Jadzia and the little Jew Liberman. Shall you come now, Daddy? I may not come home or see your mother or sister I am still in the army - a secret one. I may see you sometimes but it is dangerous too. Well, it's time to go. Good bye, Wladek. Oh, I still have something to tell you. This Jew we've talked of, the Liberman, has saved my life. I left my battle dress in his workshop. Do you remember? The policemen beat him so terribly that many young men would not have stood up and not betrayed me. The Jews are not all alike, and we have our Kusmiraks, too. Now see you later, my son, come here on next Wednesday, but remember, nobody must know. I miss Jadzia so hopelessly. I look at Warsaw from my window for hours, and I miss it. too. Does Jadzia guess anything? Does she still believe I am in Lublin, and not in Warsaw? Take care of her and don't allow to go to Warsaw, for she might learn everything. I send my love to all of you. Dr. Joseph Bialek. Are you sure Jadzia is sleeping? Good evening Mr. Walenty. Good evening Mr. Cieplikowski. Why are you going out during a shower? When six o'clock approaches and my Bronek is not yet at home. I go crazy. Where is my Bronek? Miss Jadzia? Stop, how are you? Good evening Mr. Cieplikowski. Excuse me, I'm in a hurry so see my father. To see your father? Here? What, did he leave the house? The house? Yes, did he leave the house? Is he here? The house is here, but... Miss... Who are you calling at? Jadzia appeared she went upstairs to the lodging... Good God! Fred, what are you doing in our rooms? In whose rooms? Yours? Are you mad? Get out! Don't you know whose house this is? Get out, you fool, and let me in... I will. I only have something to remind you of... Go to Ghetto, you... You pig, I'll show you! Don't say a word! Quickly, come. What's the matter? Who was it? It was the doctors Jadzia, she wanted to enter our lodging. Jadzia here? How very impudent! If she dares to come here again, I'll give her to the police. I will punish this vile Volksdeutsch. Well, don't cry. Bronek, tell me, for my head is spinning. Why are they in our rooms? Where is my father? Why, have you not been with your father? No, I've been at my aunt's in the country. You know, my father's an officer and has to hide. Oh, so ...listen, Jadzia everything is untrue. Your father has been taken away from here. To Ghetto? Yes, Jadzia, many things have changed on our street. The Kusmiraks, in your apartment, and your father behind the wall. Little boys smuggle, drink, smoke, do everything they can and like... I have to earn my soup too. I have prepared a parcel for Davidek, but he is somehow late. My poor father... What was he feeling when he sent me to the country and was all alone behind these dreadful walls. Tell me what have we done to suffer so terribly? Go and ask the Germans. I shall. Jadzia you must not go anywhere, you can be seen and then you're lost. Be still like a mouse, otherwise you can be very easily betrayed to the police. Who would betray me? Who? For instance, Fred... or... even Wladek. Wladek? Don't rely on him so much. When he learned of your father, we quarreled forever. And he told me to return this to you... Davidek? Open Bronek... I worried you were so late. Come. Jadzia are you here? How is my father? Did you see him? Yes, he lives not far from us. Oh, let's rest. Here eat. You say my father lives not far from you? I must hurry up and return, for people say there'll be a search for Jewish children. I would like to be home soon. Davidek, I will go with you. Wait, what's the hurry? I'll hide you here, dire need, hunger and typhoid fever region there. But my father is there, Bronek can't you understand? My place is with him. She has to go there. Her father... is sick. Sick? We must go first to the old city. I'll sneak under the wall there. Jadzia, take the blanket, it's raining, Wait, I will see if we can leave... Oh, you spy! You have eavesdropped and now you go and betray! Listen, Bronek. I... I... Davidek, turn the light out. Remember, Jadzia. If the situation becomes unbearable, return, we shall do something. Go, Bronek you can be noticed. Good bye, Jadzia. If something happens, ring up the Stag Pub Mrs. Piszczykowa will call me up. Davidek take care of her. Eh, damned! Davidek, Davidek! Who is there? It's I, Chaskiel. It's dangerous tonight. German sentries are everywhere. Who are they? Do they return to Ghetto too? Yes, they go everyday. His sister knits sweaters and he sells them and buys bread. This one smuggles and that one is a beggar. Hush! Let's start stealing. I go first. It's our turn Jadzia. Go out Rolf, catch the Jews! SS dogs! Run away! My dog is there! Don't fire! Nobody there. Let's go out. There is somebody here. A dog! It is shot certainly, its paw is bleeding. We must stop the bleeding otherwise it will die. Let it die it belongs to Kusmirak's SS man. It was going to kill us. His name is Rolf. I don't like his name. I don't like the whole dog. Oh, drop it... Goodness, how tired I am. I cannot go any longer. Jadzia, wake up it's dangerous here, somebody is walking there... All right, let's go Davidek. How black it is. Let's give it a good Polish name... maybe Wind. Come Jadzia. There are Germans there. Do you know where we are? No, I don't... We have lost our way... we can die here... Look, a light there! Stairs... maybe there is an entrance here. Some bombarded houses. Jadzia, it is Ghetto, come. Red spots... lots of red spots. Not all at once! Not all... Next Dr. Bialek. Dad, I... Fever 45'... you are sick with typhoid fever... Next. Dad, listen to me, Dad listen to me. Have you brought it? Yes, Good, I shall need it. Mother wished to see you... I told you. I dare not endanger all of you besides I'm leaving Warsaw for a long time. Everybody, hands up! Stop! Out! Hurry up! Long live Poland! It is from the sentry box. Frankenstein shoots children. God allows those who were good, not to see what is happening here... Nathan, we must send Jadzia away from Ghetto. I thought about it, father-in-law. I will do it tomorrow. Attention! Jewish children escape from Ghetto! The presence of Jewish children in the Aryan part of the city is legally forbidden. Everybody who helps the Jewish children gives them shelter or feeds them fall within the penalty of death! The Jewish children are all of the healthy Aryan part of the city. Escaped Jewish children when met in the Aryan part of the city should be immediately given to the police! Jadzia, wait, Jadzia! What do you want of me? I did not do you any harm. I am not a spy. The other day, in the cab shed, Bronek hit me, but he was not right, he told me himself. I wish to help you. I've been wandering since morning I went to Aunt Helen's. The house was locked. People told me she had been arrested, I don't know where Miss Clara is. Miss Clara teaches secret classes, and she often comes to us. What about your father? He was able to bear it only a year. He died in Ghetto. My father has been murdered too. Turn away, Fred is coming. My heart is beating so fast... Do you wear two rings all the time? Yes, Bronek gave me his... Give it to me now. How childish you are! I am not, and it's why I want to have it back. Oh, Wind! I have lost him a few times and he has always found me. You black devil, come. Good evening, Miss Clara. Is your mother home? I'd like to tell her the good news. I've just gotten the latest paper. I have good news for you, too. Jadzia is here. Jadzia? lmpossible! Where is she? I will show you. I'm bringing this pillow for her. Bronek, somebody is knocking. What am I to do? I'll open it myself. Wladek? Open, Bronek. Jadzia, someone has come to see you. Jadzia, my dear child! How bitterly I wept! I'm so happy you were able to escape from this hell. Hush. Not so proudly... Or the whole house will hear and the great happiness will turn to misfortune. You will live with me. I won't. I cannot endanger you. Impossible. We must not do it so quickly. You live with people, and everyone nowadays is interested with every child. Who are they? Where are they from? Maybe they escaped from Ghetto? What are we to do then? Should she stay here? In such a shed, like a thief? Well, we live in such times that decent people live like thieves, and the thieves only live quiet lives... You are right... Air raid! Lights out! Air raid! Alarm! Everybody to shelter! Lights out! Bronek, Bronek! What is the matter? We must do something with Jadzia. Just a moment. Where are you going? Go to the shelter quickly. Everybody gay like in a family tomb. Should a bomb fall near our house... We would change into goulash. Father, I'd like to go out and help Jadzia. You must go. The Kusmiraks are so terribly frightened they won't notice, but don't fail to return soon. Father they go out. Where are you going? Don't go put it is forbidden. Do you hear? I would like to know. You see our cab shed is of wood, and it has a wooden roof- one spark and the whole house might take fire. Oh, you mean the cab shed adjacent to my lodging. So I must go and see it myself. Hans, come with me. The danger is not so great, maybe I will go. Stay here. Fred, keep your eyes on them until I come back. All right. Hello is anybody there? Who is it? Hans! What's the matter? It looks suspicious - thieves or "fifth column" people. Fifth column people. Here. Is anybody there? Who is there? Rolf! My dear dog! I found you at last! You see, here is our fifth column man. He has looked for me and found me. Come... Rolf! Come here at once! What does it mean? Who is there? Answer or I shall fire! It is Jadzia our doctor daughter. Of my lodging. Why are you hiding there? Such a pretty girl Jewish? I ask - Jewish? Won't answer? No? I'll make an end with you. Rolf! Rolf! What are you doing Oh! The alarm is over. You may leave your shelter. Boys. She's Jewish and has come here again. Where did he run? Go this way, we shall go that way. Did you hear? It was certainly Jadzia. Follow them. You won't escape me now. You pretend to be Aryan, don't you? I don't pretend anything. But you don't wear the band, do you? I have my band, leave me alone. Wait, why are you in such a hurry? Your father or Hans is not here, we can talk... Stop! Look, they run like bugs... Jewish? Don't you understand my questions? You're poison. Davidek, they detected me, Fred is running after me. Draw off. Why? I have smuggled goods, they may control me. What then? I have potatoes and grenades. What have you? Grenades... you know - bombs... Bombs? Who is fighting there? Jewish, eh? I'm not a Jewish, a Jewish girl was here, I will show you where she has run... You are Jewish, too? I am not Jewish, no, no! Stop! Stop! It is Fredek... Stand up. We should wait. One is never sure what one should do I think we may go. Davidek, why is the town so desolate? Don't you know? Germans said they are taking people to the east to work. They took my mother and my aunt, and killed them all with gas in Treblinka. Uncle Nathan has fled from there and we have hidden grandfather. We knew they killed old people immediately. Now the only people who are saved are the ones who sew battle dresses in German Huts. Good morning Jadzia. Why did you bring her here now? You know we shall start one of these days... She had to come here uncle. We should let grandfather go out. Grandpa is constantly praying for mother and Auntie Regina and does penance for all Jews. Go out father-in-law. Go out, grandpa, please. What have you brought, Davidek? I did not bring much, but they had promised me to prepare more for tomorrow. Davidek, Feed grandfather, I must go out. Who is this? Jadzia. You've come to see Ester, Regina, and they are not at home, they have gone out. Stay here Jadzia, I'll find a job for you. Work! Work! Work! Quicker. Quicker, quicker work! Work, you Jewish devil! Attention! Good morning sir! Get up! Herr Director! Get up! The production? Only 170 pieces. Too bad, it is no work. Show me the dropsical man. This one. Come here! Nearer! We don't need in our establishment such old carrion. We need good workers, young people. How can the work go well if you have no good workers here? Who has brought her here? Not I. I told you long ago to take away all children. I am seventeen years old. How old is she? She says, she is seventeen. She is seventeen years old. Seventeen. And away with the old one. What has happened? They have surrounded Ghetto from all sides. They are preparing something, damned dogs. In a half hour a fire will be sent on the whole establishment. Herr Director says Warsaw must be free from Jewish. Who ever go to Poniatowo will survive this war. You will get work there; everybody may take 15 kilos of luggage. Jews don't look at him, look higher up! There on the roofs. Polish and Jewish flags of fight have been hoisted. Hush! I am Jewish, too. Herr Director wishes you well. Brothers, the Jewish organization calls to fight! To the trenches! Germans set fire on the whole street! Nathan, let's go to grandpa's, Nathan let's go to Grandpa's. Don't look back. Go to the wall. Hurry up! Crawl! To the next house gate, quickly! We shall go through the garrets. Company one, forward! Don't shoot! Let them come to the middle of the square. For the older beloved daughter window Ester ...for the beloved younger daughter Regina... For the beloved grandson Davidek... Father-in-law come the Germans set fire on our street. Father-in-law I have room for you in the trench. The Jews started fighting... ...Take away from us any sins and purify us of any defilement in the hour of our death... Grandpa, come with us, escape, save your live. Go without me. Davidek knows where the entrance to the sewer is. You'll go to the Aryan part of the city. You must go with us, Uncle and we must take grandpa with us. We may not leave him here. Grandpa does not want to go anywhere and I will stay with him. We will not go without of you. Listen, children, you have no father but me. I am everybody for you, you have to obey me. As soon as you leave this place call Bronek, he will help you. Jadzia, what is the matter? My mouth is full of sand. Good God, how thirsty I am! Wait a moment I will look for water. Hello! No, it isn't the theater, wrong number. Hello! The Stag Pub? Please call up Bronek. Yes, he is surely at the corner cab parking. Mr. Bronek, a telephone call for you. I am coming. Who is this? Yes, it is Bronek Save us... everything is burning here... come to our sewer... Which sewer? Hello, hello! Hello, hello... something's wrong... I talked with Bronek. How? I found a telephone... Let's run to the sewers now. Hans come and see. You false dog. Where will you go? Stay here. Leave the dog. Come and see Ghetto is burning... Wladek, I have news. They live. I talked with Davidek... they are going through some sewers begging for help... Well, let us go, quickly. Damn, what shall we do? Come, we shall enter the first sewer we meet... Children where are you going? We must save Jadzia and Davidek. Bronek... Stop my father calls me... Boys have you hidden somebody again? Where? Something is moving there where Jadzia was hidden. Wait, it is Wind... Wladek, come here... Wladek. I have an idea, I have Jadzia's cap - you see? The dog knows the way. He will follow Jadzia and we will follow the dog. It is this sewer. I shall wait for you here. Be careful so that nothing happens to you. And as we parish for the sanctity of your name, take us to your kingdom and allow us to be there with those we loved who died and who are now dying... People, help! For the faith in you... Jadzia, hurry up, gas! We will be suffocated. The only important thing is for me to suffer no longer... Wind, dear dog... Jadzia, Jadzia... I hear barking there... do you hear? Bronek. Davidek, We would never have found you without the dog. The Germans guard every entrance and it's such a maze down here that it's very difficult to find the way. Fear not, those are Jewish combatants. Come. They are going in the wrong directions, they're going the way of Ghetto, and we should stop them. Gentlemen, you are going in the wrong direction. Ghetto is there; everything's on fire. Thank you boy, we know our way. Davidek wait. Davidek, you shall not go there. I won't allow you, you would die there. My grandpa and my Uncle Nathan are there, I have nobody but them. Stay with us, you can rely upon us. I won't let you go. I have to go there. Davidek... It is dearest thing I have from my father, take it... Wladek, thank you. Don't cry Jadzia, he cannot die, he won't die... Farewell, Davidek... We believe, too, that you won't die, that at the other side of the Border Street everybody will fight. Wladek and Bronek and everyone who knows that are no borders between the people and that all people are equal to one another... THE END
