My name is Hope Cassidy. Sometimes all you have is your name. Hope. Attention, attention!! Suspect Kelly Roos is heading for the Grand Bazaar. Cover all the exits!! Move! My parents planned on having three girls: Hope, Faith and Charity. A plane crash prevented there being any Faith or Charity, leaving only Hope. Get out of the way! My dad used to say to me: "In times of trouble, you only have to remember who you are. Because no matter how bad things will get, there's always hope." Get out of the way! Get out of the way! My father was an eternal optimist. That's what made him think his plane wouldn't go down in that thunderstorm. He was wrong. I'm not Kelly Roos. English. Please. Help! My name is Hope Cassidy.

Sure, as you wish, no problem. Here. Here. Istanbul has population of over 12 million. It was founded in the seventh century and was once the capital of Byzantine Empire, and then of Ottoman sultans.

What kind of name is Z.Z.? Apparently, I was conceived to a ZZ Top song. So I don't know, this is not what I expected. I actually didn't know what to expect. I'm glad I'm here, though. Yeah? Yeah. For a job? Someone called me out of the blue, had apparently checked me out. I was so excited, I sent him a dozen roses. I haven't sent a guy roses in my life. So are you gonna stay? Yeah, I... I kind of have to. You have to? Yeah, whatever. Just make the best out of whatever situation you're in, you know? Right. Well, I'm glad you're here. Maybe we can explore together. It'll be fun. I'd like that. Hope, listen... Hello! I'll make a good deal for you, huh? - Pretty scarf, see? - No. Are you married, girls? I can give you a tour in the harem like no one ever seen before. - At the Topkapi Palace. - Okay. No? No! - Hello? - It's Ali. Good morning. We have your first assignment. Galata Financial. Their security system is failing, vulnerable to attack. They need our best, smartest, cleverest. I'm anxious to get started. But first I need to go to the American consulate and get my visa straightened out. Then right after, they'll be expecting you. Sounds great. Just send the directions and info to my Pocket PC, please. Yes, okay. Hi. Could you connect me with Z.Z. Jackson's room, please? Of course. I'm sorry, but we don't have anyone registered under that name. Well, that's impossible. She checked in yesterday. No. There seems to be a misunderstanding. Okay. Thank you. Taxi. Taxi! Thank you. Look what I have for you right here. Yes! Brand-spanking-new. You won't have any problem getting a work visa with that. Thank you so much. That was so easy. It usually takes, like... This is not me. I know. Everybody hates their picture. You should see mine. No, that's my picture, that's my address. But that's not my name. My name is Hope Cassidy, this says... Kelly Roos. Yeah. Are you sure this isn't you? Yes, I'm sure this is not me! You have to change it. We're just a consulate. We can do renewals of passports here, but reissues has to be done by the embassy in Ankara. I can't... I can't believe this. I don't know what to tell you. I mean... Look, on the computer here, I have you as Kelly Roos. And so maybe there's like some computer error or... This is not normal. I'm sorry. I promise you I'll try and clear this up as quickly as I can. Can you come back Thursday? Friday, maybe? Okay, thank you. Next! I'm so tired. Can we please just take a break? No. No? Tomorrow you will be charged for a double murder, and the theft of millions of dollars. I want a lawyer. I have one day to see you... No, I want a phone call! And I want to know everything about the murders. - About the money! - You can't keep me locked up! I'm an American citizen and I have rights! I want my phone call, I want my lawyer, and I want it now! God! Let's continue. What are you doing here? Are you following me? No, no, no. I'm just trying to work. You've got to stop following me. It's freaking me out. All right. How will you get to next appointment? Well, I... All right. How many millions will this cost me? Don't worry, it's no problem. We will come to an arrangement. I'll take you wherever you want to go. So this is Galata's offices? Yeah, they are wealthy company and eccentric. I know these people. I'll probably be a number of hours. Uh, all right, I wait. Okay. Okay. My name is Hope Cassidy to see Mr. Ibrahim Zoralan. Um... Oh, I have a driver's license. Yeah, okay. Well, I had my driver's license. I don't know... It has to be in here somewhere. - Hope Cassidy! So pleased to have you be my acquaintance. Ibrahim Zoralan, come with me. I've heard so much about you, you know. This is our new offices. Built in late 1800s by one of the last sultans. You can still see the construction going on. Galata is an international holding company. A hundred million dollars a day go through this building through our supercomputer. Right this way, please. Oh, I'm sorry. You tripped the alarm. You're lucky I'm here. To turn it off? That, and, uh... Don't worry, I'll protect you. Ibrahim Zoralan. Voice-activated security? - My own design. - And cannot be duplicated. So this is it. Galata's nerve centre. Our supercomputer. I call it Ibrahim. After myself, of course. Impressed? With the computer? Yes. You've got firewalls tripping all over each other routers that date to Constantine. Also, you see that, what's going on up there? You are about one broken security key away from someone having complete access to every dollar going through here. Well, that's why you're here. Ibrahim needs protection. He's tense, he works very hard. He needs your women's intuition. Your comforting. Mr. Zoralan, I'm being paid about $475 an hour because I'm fast and good. When not distracted. Now, if you feel you like my company that much this could take about a month. If I back off? I'll be done by tomorrow. I'll miss your wonderful company. I'm sure your wife will take your mind off of it. I will have my security liaisons officer to watch over you until it is time to leave. Why, you don't trust me? Well, with the amount of money going through here I do not trust Allah to be alone here. Good luck, Miss Cassidy. Thank you. What's that? The consulate guy. He was found floating in the Bosporus an hour ago. Don't you get it? These people are doing everything they can to keep you from finding out who I am. Are you sure it's not you doing everything to stop me? Don't give me that psychological babble, doctor. These people are trying to destroy me! Who are you? What? I'm sorry? Who are you? I don't understand. I'm Hope Cassidy. No, you're not. Excuse me? I just spoke to Ali Abay from Suzer International. I was telling him how happy we were to have you here. And he told me you were an impostor. I'm sorry, I don't know what you're talking about. Do you have an ID? A passport? Of course. I... I just... I don't have it with me. Look, you know what? Let me give Ali a call and we'll get this whole thing cleared up. Okay? - Okay. - Suzer International. Yes, my name's Hope Cassidy, uh, can I speak with a Mr. Ali Abay? ♪ Hope Cassidy? ♪ Yes. Hope Cassidy. Please hold. - Hello, this is Hope Cassidy. - Hello? This is Hope Cassidy, can I help you? No! Okay. Hello? Hello? No, there's... There's been a mistake! No, you're not listening! Where's your passport? See, that's the problem! ID. Identification. Yes, well, I had my driver's license, but I think I left it at the hotel. Hey, hey, hey. Let's go, let's go. Keep walking. Don't look back. Don't look back. What happened there, Osman? What did you say to them? I said I was your uncle and you were a crazy person like everyone from the United States. Right? Oh. Great. What happened? I don't know. Look, someone has taken my place. It's this crazy, weird setup or something. I mean, my passport, my credit cards, my bank accounts, everything. Someone has taken me. I always knew that trouble was at this building. Why? They... They seemed fine. Ivanakov. Ivanakov? Yeah. Arms dealer. A Russian. He's very bad man. - A man with no soul. - So he owns Galata? I suggest you be careful. Let's go. - Where we are going now? - Take me to Suzer. So you'll wait? Sure, of course. Thanks, Osman. If you weren't here, I'd think I was going insane. All right. I'll be in the garage. Okay. Bye, Osman. Suzer International. Hi, I'm here to see Hope Cassidy, could you tell me where her office is? I'm sorry, but I need your name. Just a moment. Uh, excuse me, can I help you? Not unless you have a gun. Excuse me? Excuse me? What are you doing? Look, whoever you are... No, you know exactly who I am. You're wearing my clothes! I'm sorry, I really don't know who you are. I'm Hope! Why are you impersonating me? I called you at the hotel, you never checked in. Ok... Okay. Um... Look, you can't be Hope, because I'm Hope Cassidy, okay? Selim! Miss Cassidy? Yeah, we have a problem here. Hey, I saw that. Look, I just wanna know why you're screwing with me, okay? What do you want? What's all the talking about here? Ali, thank God that you're here. This crazy woman, she just barged in here! Ali, thank God. Who are you? I'm Hope Cassidy. Hope, what's going on? I don't know. No, don't call her Hope! She's a fake! Z.Z., Kelly Roos. Or God knows what her name is. I'm Hope, okay? She stole everything. My name, my credit cards, my clothes. Okay, remember yesterday we had a conversation and you wanted me to do a job. You called me... "The best, brightest, the cleverest." No. She must have tapped in on our call or something. This is crazy. You remember when you gave me the job, what did I do? I sent you roses. I never sent a guy roses before. Yes. No, I told her that. I told you that! You remember what else I said? I said I needed to get my passport straightened out. Right? Remember? Right? Hope Cassidy. Do you have your passport? No, that is... This is crazy, okay? I can prove to you that I'm Hope Cassidy. The Galata job... Look, miss... I can tell you access codes, the security system, anything. Security's on their way. Wait a minute! Call the police as well, now! No, I have done nothing wrong here! Miss, you say you have all the access codes. Exactly. We just had a call from Galata. They are missing $14 million out of their system. Oh, God! Stop her, stop her! Get Security! Hey! - Move! - Hey! Come on, come on, come on. No! Osman! Osman! Osman! Come on, we gotta go fast, okay? I'll explain later. Come on, come on! Osman! Come on. Move! Go, go! What do you want from me? Oh! Great, what else? Get out of the way! Get out of the way! I can't believe this! Hope this works. Yes! Sorry. Okay. Please pick up, pick up. This is James, leave me a message and I'll get back to you as soon as possible. James, it's me, Hope. Please answer. I'm in a lot of trouble. You were right. It's just gone so wrong. I just really... I really need your help right now. Look, if you're there, could you just please pick up, please? James? Look, I know this is difficult. Do you? Do you know what it feels like to go an entire life and realize that none of it matters? That, basically, the person you thought you were doesn't exist? Chai with cream. Okay. Oh, my God. Hey, hey! What did you do next? What could I do? I had no place to stay no identity, very little money. I had the police and some Russian arms dealers and God knows who else were after me. There was really only one place that I could go to find out why this was happening to me. Galata. I thought it had very strong security. I didn't say it was gonna be easy. See, if I could get into their system then I could find out how they moved the money and to where. That would give me my start to who these people were. I knew that I would have to work at night. So the first problem was how to get in. Galata Financial. Ibrahim Zoralan, please. I'm afraid he has left for the day. Can you hold for a second? I'll see if I can get him on the phone. I'm sorry, who am I speaking to? Ibrahim Zoralan, who is this? Gotcha. Ibrahim Zoralan. Ten minutes. This better work. Damn it. They had changed the codes after the break-in. So, what did you do? I did a probability search. A probability search? It's a surface program that I wrote. I asked the computer to tell me which keys are most probable to be struck at a certain time. For example, in the morning, when they're accessing the system. It could take a while but I knew that it might be my only chance. Almost there, almost there. Come on. Yes! Okay, let's get started. Fourteen million dollars, where are you? Where would you be? Whoever did this set up phoney accounts and moved them over a dozen times in order to cover up their tracks. Finally making one mistake. They put it in my name. She's left the terminal. I'm tracking her Pocket PC signal. Attention, she's moving. She's heading down the main hallway. Yes, upstairs. She's up here. She's in the conference room. Where did she go? Where is my money? Kelly Roos. Find her before the police do. The minute she gets on a computer, she'll have a signature something that will give her away. We track her, then we kill her. No. Bring her to me. So you got the money? No. Not yet, at least. I knew I couldn't stay on the streets. I needed help. But you said you knew no one. Not no one. Roxelena. Oh, hey, Diana, the moon goddess. Yeah. So you took my advice. What do you think of Ortaköy? I'm in trouble. I need your help. Okay. Come. We'll go to my place. Hey, you hungry? I have Turkish food. Very special, very famous. Yeah, that sounds great, I'm starved. Here you are. Hey, Roxelena, I just wanted to say thanks. I don't know what I would've done if I hadn't found you. Hey, maybe I found you. It's no problem. I don't understand, Hope. I know. This sounds crazy. And I don't expect you to believe me. You know what? I want to. Are you able to get on the Internet? Okay, here we go. Mmm. Mmm. Oh, my God. What is in the bottom of that? The grounds. Don't drink them. God. Here, look. Put the saucer on top of it, okay? Okay. I can tell your fortune. Really? Now turn it upside down. Okay. Yes. Okay, now what happens? Wait. Americans are always in so much of a hurry. Yeah, well, it happens when people are trying to kill you. I just don't understand any of this, you know. The cops are after you they stole the money that you didn't take but now you're gonna try and steal... Borrow. Borrow the money back. Okay, borrow. How do you even expect to get it out? Well, they used my name for the bank account. Hope Cassidy. That is my name. So, basically, I'm just gonna re-create myself. Come here, sit down and watch. See, that's the president of the bank Abdul Hamit, and that is his e-mail address. We can bounce an e-mail to the local bank from his account to make it look like it came from him. So here we go. "To all, I would like to make sure that everyone extends the greatest hospitality to one of our most-favoured American clients." Hope Cassidy. Exactly. ♪ "She will be visiting tomorrow. Please ensure her transaction requests are handled smoothly and efficiently. Best regards, Abdul Hamit." It's in English. Yes, but... There you go. Will they let you in without ID? No. But I thought of that too. We do a search for an image of him. See? All right, watch. And now you just print it out. Brilliant. You're a genius. Anyway what's my fortune? Duck! No! Hope, run! Run! Where is it? Where is it? Where is it? Roxelena it's okay. Listen. Listen to me. I am so sorry, but we have to get out of here. We have no time, all right? Do you have somewhere you can go until this is over? Yes. I want you to go, okay? What you gonna do? Fight back. We sent the police to the apartment. They did not find the body. No sign of a struggle. But he was there when I left. Nothing. Like it never happened. And where is Roxelena now? I don't know. I told her to... Vanish. Very convenient. You know what? I was scared and I was concerned for her and I wasn't thinking about my damn alibi. Now, I'm sure you and your guys out there can find her. The airline has no record of her working there. If you could tell me her last name... How many people do you pass by in life and you don't know their last name? Or any name at all? This woman could be your only hope. You think I'm making this whole thing up. Do you speak English? Yes. My name's Hope Cassidy. I believe Mr. Hamit said I was coming? It's a pleasure to have you here. Simit? No, thank you. Chai? Mr. Hamit has spoken greatly about you. Thank you. How may I help you? Here is my account number. Yes. I would like to move all my money into a new account and purchase Turkish bonds for security. This, of course, is no problem. How much would you like to purchase? It's all written down there. Oh. Yes. Certainly, yes. Is there a problem? Abdul told me... No, no. No problem. But there will be a fee. Which I am more than happy to pay. Yes. Of course. And, you see, we may need some form of identification. Oh. Of course, yes, um, I... I'm sorry. Could you please give that to Mr. Hamit the next time you see him? Oh. Yes. Of course. Now then, should we start the paperwork? Absolutely. Yes. I have your money. I'll trade you. I really don't know what you're talking about. Fourteen million dollars, which I'll trade for my life back That's it, no questions asked. I really don't know what you're talking about. Tell you what♪. I either get my life back or let the Russian arms dealers know where it is and who took it. Arms dealers? Yeah. Not nice people. Especially when it comes to stolen money. You're not serious. I'm dead serious. But you have to understand. I haven't... You took my life away. I just... I thought that I was helping. Helping who? I don't know. They said that this wouldn't be dangerous. Who said? Z.Z., who said? Who is doing this? I was in jail, this guy came and he said he was from the American Embassy. He said, "Trust me. I'll turn this nightmare of yours into a dream." ♪ That's what he told me♪. Okay, so they used you. ♪ They used me♪. Okay, we're in this together. So please tell me who's behind this. Okay, look, we'll make a change, just come to the office. My terms. The Süleymaniye Mosque, 6 p.m. Look, I'm just here to make a deal. You can have it all I just want my li... Oh, God. Oh, God, Z.Z. No, no! I didn't do it, okay? I didn't do it! And now I'm here. That was everyone you met? Yes. No one else who could verify your story vouch for you? No. So? Yes? So you believe me. You believe that I'm Hope Cassidy. I believe that you believe you're Hope Cassidy. You've gotta be kidding me. Guardians! I cannot believe you! Guardians! Why have you done this to me? You've kept me locked in here for days now! And you haven't listened to a word I've said. Let go of me! Oh, I hate you! There is no evidence to support what you say. There's no record that you're Hope Cassidy. No, I explained that to you. You had the knife that killed Hope Cassidy. No! That was not me! That was Z.Z., okay? I was trying to save her. I'm Hope Cassidy! I'm Hope Cassidy! Why won't you listen to me? Someone has to know me! Oh, no! Please. You have no proof of any of your story. No, I have proof. The money. I can tell you where it is. Does anyone else know where it is? No. Good. It may be the only thing that will buy you off the death penalty. This is your last hope. My name is Hope Cassidy. Hope. Hope. Hope. Hope, sweetie, wake up. Hope. You okay? God. James. Come here. I can't believe it. You're here. You're here. I'm here, Hope. I've never been so happy to hear someone say my name. What are you doing here? How did you even find me? I've been here for days. I looked at the hotel, but you checked out. I even looked at the morgue. Yeah. You won't believe what's going on. I heard, they told me. At the police station. They had me in... Jail, I know. Once I was able to verify your identity, they were all so embarrassed. I made a quick, angry phone call to the embassy I had you out in seconds flat. You don't remember any of this? Some things. Little bits, I guess. Where are my clothes? Your clothes are trashed. I ordered you new ones, they'll be here soon. Thank you. Anything else we put in this. What the heck is that? It's my evil-eye bracelet. It wards off bad luck. I think you might wanna check those batteries, sweetheart. I can't wait to get out of this city and go home. First flight out tomorrow morning. Oh, I can't believe this is almost over. I'm so happy. I gotta run over to the embassy before it closes to do some paperwork before we leave. No, please don't go. Well, I'll be back in less than an hour. You're gonna be fine, nothing's gonna happen to you. Police even have a guard outside the door. Tomorrow morning we leave for Los Angeles. All right? All right. Trust me. I'll turn this nightmare of yours into a dream. I was in jail and... This guy said he was from the American Embassy. He said, "Trust me, I'll turn this nightmare of yours into a dream." Okay. Okay. - Who are you? - Who are you? Come on, tell me who you are. Who are you working for? Hello, Hope. Let him go. No. I said, let him go. No! Let's go. You were in on this from the beginning? Who do you think gave Suzer all your recommendations? You were good, but we had to get them to take notice to hire you. You set me up! This all could have been so easy, you know. Easy? Easy for who? You just had to leave the money alone. You stole my life. People were trying to kill me. Hey, we all had to make sacrifices. I had to pretend I was in love with you. But there are some perks I am gonna miss. That was the problem with you from the beginning. You never appreciated what you had. Why me? Why you? Because we could. No parents, no friends, no life. No one would miss you when you were gone. Hey, you wanted adventure. Well, you got it. You could have stolen the money by yourself. From Russian gunrunners? We'd never live to see a dime of it. No, we needed a patsy, somebody expendable. Ah! Hope! Shit. What? Open the door! Who are you? I'm an intelligence officer for Interpol. Computer Crimes Division. We've been tracking your boyfriend, James whose real name is David Thompson and Dr. Kavak for years. Kavak's involved too? She's a cop gone bad. The money. I can tell you where it is. Does anyone else know where it is? No. So, what do you want with me? We left you alone too long. It's not safe anymore. Not safe anymore? Time to bring you in. So, what, you bring me in, and for the rest of my life I'm running looking over my shoulder? No, uh-uh, I don't think so. You haven't got a choice. Yes, I do. They wanna go to the bank, get the money? I say we let them get it. I had her. The bitch pulled me down the stairs. No. No... Hold on. No! Take it easy. Calm down, calm down. Don't do anything stupid. Where are you taking me? I think you know where. You're gonna kill me after you get the money? Oh, it's not that simple. Once I get my money, you're free to do whatever you want. But as long as you're alive I don't think those Russians are gonna forget about you. Do you? Kavak? Didn't know you made house calls. Bank opens in five. Let's go. And here I thought you were the boss. Come on. Before we do this, can I go to the bathroom? I've been sitting in a car all night. No. You stay in our sights. I can cause quite a scene. It's fine. I'll go with her. Wait, wait, wait. Okay. Leave the door open. You've taken everything else I have, how about leaving me a bit of dignity? All right. Come on, we haven't got all day. I'm coming. Hold on. Done? I'd just like to wash my hands. Let's get the money. Hi. I would like to go to my safety-deposit box. Yes, of course. Come with me. I'm sorry, ma'am, box holders only. Of course. Don't worry, I just want this thing to be over. Here she is. I drop the bag in the car and then I'm walking. I'm done. You do as we tell you. We count the money first. Get off of me! Let me go! Get off of me! Who the hell are you? You took our money. Get off of me! Who has the money? You are? Hope Cassidy. And you are? Kelly Roos. Kelly Roos. It seems you took a great deal of my money. You can have it back. And then I let you go? Something like that. You can keep the doctor and her boy toy if you'd like. It doesn't work that way. Who would respect me? How could I do business if I was so generous? I'll let you pick who goes first. No, look, we don't have to do this. Choose. We can talk about this. Choose. Choose! No, this doesn't have to happen! Choose! Um... Um... How the hell did you even find us? Sometimes you just have to have hope. A lot of good it did her. Captain thank you for your help. Anytime. You can ride in the ambulance if you'd like. I really should. Can I get up yet? Yes, you are safe. It's not easy being dead. The only way they wouldn't come looking for you. I was panicked this wouldn't work. Come on, we haven't got all day. Here, put this on. You know I was wondering. How did you find me at the hotel? We knew where you were at all times. Hey, why do you think I gave it to you? So this whole thing was a setup from the beginning. I told you on the plane nothing is ever as it seems in Istanbul. You could have told me something. I did. At the appropriate time. Here you go. New passport and new name. You remembered. And some money and clothes to get you started. So will it ever be safe to go back to being me? Not until we know how far-reaching the organization is. Even then... That's all right. I was getting a little tired of being me. By the way all of the money burned in the car with Ivanakov that was all the money, wasn't it? Here I thought we trusted each other. I had to ask. Do you think we can trust her? We have to. We may need her again. Oh...
