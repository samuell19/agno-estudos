I don't understand. Maharaj, I am your disciple. How is that possible? I don't even know you. I know you very well. I've secretly listened to you sing for a year. Later on, I used to go to the jungle... and try to blend the notes with my shehnai. However, today I couldn't control myself. I played it in front of you. That's great. My son, who taught you to play the shehnai? My ancestors played the shehnai for many generations. My father used to play the shehnai in the temple of Sajanpur. I used to practice with him every day to play the shehnai. - However now I... - What happened now? Speak. My father is no more. To install I'm an orphan. I roamed everywhere and... you settled here. Don't worry. Don't wander any longer. You're safe here. - What's your name? Kishen. To install Kishen. It's a wonderful name. Come my son. You'll stay with us. - Will we meet again, Kishen? - Of course, Gopi. Come along with me. Kishen, Kishen. - What's the matter my dear? - What happens if she remains unmarried? - If who remains unmarried? - My dolls. Kishen said he'd play the shehnai at my doll's wedding. - He's a big man now. How can I meet him? - Of course he'll come. Kishen, you'll have to play the shehnai at her doll's wedding. Give my blessings to your doll. Come along my son. To install Ramkali. - Why are you late, father? - I brought a guest with me. Jaggu, arrange a room for the guest. - Father, who is he? - He's the guest, my dear. Come and sit here my son. Don't sit on the carpet. Sit on the sofa. You're an artist, after all. Your age is small but your talent is big. Which musical notes were you playing in the temple? I don't know. I only know the tune, not the basics. The basics are man made. I'll teach them to you. - Rami, - Yes, father. - What are you doing? I'm decorating the groom doll. He's marrying Gopi's doll. My dear, you should hear him play the shehnai. He plays it amazingly. Well done dear. Will you play it? What are the bride and groom's names? What's his name, Rami? Tell me the groom's name first. What a wedding! You don't know the names of the bride and groom. - The groom's name is Kishen. - The bride's name is Gopi. 'Panditji', be quick. We'll miss the auspicious moment. 'Panditji' what are you doing? The auspicious moment will be gone. Jamuna aunty, do you know what's going on? - What's going on? Come quickly or else you'll regret it. Will you keep holding hands forever? Kishen, you played the shehnai wonderfully. You'll have to play it again for Gopi's marriage. How can I play the shehnai at Gopi's marriage? I'll be the groom in Gopi's marriage... - - and Gopi will be my... - Shut up. You scoundrel! Don't you ever think of marrying Gopi! You'll be fortunate just to play the shehnai at her marriage. To install lost. What's all this nonsense? Get out of here. Don't you understand who you play with? Come with me. You go and look at your face in the mirror. I'll marry Gopi. Do you understand? 'You scoundrel! Don't you ever think of marrying Gopi!' 'You'll be fortunate just to play the shehnai at her marriage.' Kishen, why are you lying down? Get up and practice the shehnai. Sit down. - Kishen. - What? You've become a master at playing the shehnai. I've attained success due to my Guruji's blessings. I'd be nothing without him. You should ask someone's heart about your enchanting music. Whom should I ask? Gopi was praising you as the best... shehnai payer in the entire world. You say the same thing Rami. - But you don't care. - What did you say? Nothing. I'll bring you a soft drink. Your tunes and my songs We'll blend together and bring out the essence of love Your tunes and my songs You are in my heart. You are in my dreams, too There may be many in this world but only you have enchanted me I worship you my beloved We will come together and bring out the essence of love Your tunes and my songs If you forget me... If you go away from me... My love has that magic which will attract you to me. We will definitely succeed We will come together and bring out the essence of love Your tunes and my songs Do you remember when you held my hand earlier? It was during your doll's wedding. Ramkali then asked jokingly if... we'd hold hands forever. I held your hands for the rest of my life. Do you remember what you said? I said I won't play the shehnai at... your marriage. I'll be the groom. - Gopi would be my... - Shut up. Gopi. - Kishen, I'm afraid I'll never get married. - Don't say that. The shehnai will be played at your marriage. However, it will be played by someone else. Kishen, the tunes echo in my heart every single moment of my life. Your tunes have made me crazy. If you're not there, I don't know how to play the shehnai. It's your love which allows me to play the shehnai so marvelously. The music has bonded our love. Gopi. Kishen, Kishen. That scoundrel Kanhaiya has come. - What is it? - What else could it be? It's your letter. My letter? Give me my letter. There's no letter, but a message for you. - What news have you brought? - News of your death. - Kanhaiya! - I warn you not to meet with Gopi. She's to be engaged to me. You can then play the shehnai at our marriage. - So, that's it. Remember your status... before talking to me. - Be careful. You can't hit a government servant. - Get lost. Government servant indeed! Ramkali, Rami. Yes father. - Where were you? - Did Kishen return? He returned a while back. He ate and is sleeping now. Really? It's been a long time. - How do you know? - You were engrossed in the music. Yes dear. Music is such that one who doesn't get engrossed in it... can never understand it. Go to sleep my dear. What are you doing? Come and have your food. Did you eat? Do you think I'll remain hungry without you? - I'm a bit late today. - Did I ask you about it? Will I have to wash your hands now? Come, I'll wash them for you. What are you doing? You're embarrassing me Rami. - This is a kind of service... - I don't mind. I wish to serve you always. Come have food. I've prepared your favorite food. - You've pampered me a lot. - Be careful in the future. Didn't you say you already ate? How can I eat before you do? Can anyone eat before offering it to God? You don't seem to know about it. I've forgotten my past. Why do you think of me as God? You know my past and present very well. I'll never forget it. Rami, I wonder what would happen without your support. Why do you say that, Kishen? Everyone is small before they become big. I'm confused. Why do you see me as God and at times as a big man? What is in me, after all, that I can't see? You're very humble. There's a big talent hidden in you. Rami, can you please clarify? Kishen. How can I stop myself? Just forget this conversation. Come and have food. Mother! Where are you going? To Bindiya's house to listen... - to the radio. I'll be back soon. Come back soon. Kishen, are you going to the jungle to practice the shehnai? Why don't you offer your services to God by practicing... in the temple before the deity? - The workers are renovating the temple. - Raise their spirits... by playing your shehnai and they'll work faster. Go.

Kishen, someone has stolen my clothes. Anyway, Gopi's clothes are always stolen. How can you joke Kishen? How'll I get home? How about we exchange clothes? Neither of us will be recognized. You can leave for home after dark. - Now, come along with me. - Where are you taking me? Just follow me. How can you ask this to your beloved? - What did you say? - I'm doing this for your benefit. If you go now everybody will see you. But not after dark. You're a scared cat. - So, you're teasing me. Yes. After all, I caught you. Gopi, you were great today. Kishen, you played the shehnai marvelously today. My body excites when I hear you play the shehnai. I go completely crazy. Today, people were staring at us. Let them stare. I don't care. We're childhood friends and will remain friends forever. Our childhood's world was different. Our world is different now. Nothing has changed. We're the same old Kishen and Gopi. - Oh God! - What do you mean? You're very immature even at your age. I'm very stubborn. How are you sir? May the two of you live long Sir, you're lucky to have a beautiful wife. We're wanderers. We earn by moving from one place to another. - Is this your daughter-in-law? - She is my wife. - Kishen looked at them. - What work do you do? - Flowers, leaves, name, place god, goddesses... - Whatever you... You didn't complete your sentence. I don't understand. We create tattoos on the bodies of people. its mark never fades. Can you support yourselves? We hardly earn anything. Everything has changed now. - Even your world has changed. - Why do you say so? Earlier, every woman would tattoo her body so that... her husband's name would go with her everywhere. My husband is right. Everything has changed. Nothing has changed. I'll tattoo my Kishen's name on my hand. May you both, husband and wife, live long. Long live your husband. I'll make the best tattoo on your hand of your husband's name. Gopi, don't do this. Nothing will happen. I have tattoos all over my hands. I'll get a tattoo of 'Kishen'. Your body is very delicate. We're already married. If you were already married... then you won't have chosen your husband's name. We understand this little bit. Alright, may the Lord fulfill your wishes. Gopi, forget it and listen to me. Of course not. it may be your name but it's my body after all. You do as you wish. Dear, what's the matter? Your legs must be aching. I'll massage them for you. Stop flattering me. Not there. Do it here.. Why are you so angry? That's the sign of love. Even if the person dies, the sign won't go. If I tattoo my hand, then anyone can see it. If it's on my upper arm, then it will be hidden. Don't worry. it only hurts at first. It won't hurt later on. - Are you blind? - Can't you ride properly? You, too, are walking blindly. We've lost our earnings. - How much was it? Not much. But we've lost it. Do you have a lantern on your bicycle? - Why don't you light the lantern? - I'll do it right away. Why don't you take the money from me? I have hard-earned money. I'll look for it then. I found my money. Did you hear me? I got the money. You found it because of my lantern.

He called her Gopi. Gopi! I'm done for. - It's a fake coin. - Make up your mind. Real or fake? It's absolutely fake. They fooled you. I'm a government servant. I will give you real money. Why are you coming with me? You wait here. How can you tell my husband to wait and take me along with you? You scoundrel! - I'll show you some day. - Get lost. Who is it? Kanhaiyalal! Who's the letter from? How can I deliver letters at night? I've bought news. - What news? Bad news. Bad news? I was shocked to hear the bad news. - What's the matter? - Don't ask sir. - You'll cry after hearing it. - Did anyone die? - Who died? - I died a little bit. You! We're not so fortunate that you die. Get lost! - Why are you joking? - What's the matter? Your daughter is having an affair with Kishen Shehnaiwale. - She's even tattooed his name on her hand. Oh my god. - I'm very unfortunate. - Didn't I warn you earlier? - Gangaram, did you hear him. - He's listening to me. I've heard enough. Have you read it in the newspaper? It's the truth.

He seems to be an important artist. Please have tea my son. His tunes are very enchanting. No wonder the Gopis were attracted by the tunes from... Lord Kishen's flute. They would forget everything as if hypnotized. - I'll go to meet him. - Shekhar. Scoundrel! He bothers everyone playing his shehnai. - Who was the mother? - He was Gangaram's friend's son. He came to meet us. That was great. You play the shehnai beautifully. - Who are you? - I'm a worshiper of art. I am shekhar. I'm the Music Producer at the Lucknow radio station. I never knew a musical instrument like the shehnai... could be played so beautifully. - Why don't you come with me to Lucknow? No. This place is everything to me. You're wasting your talent in this small village. If you play the shehnai on the radio... then you'll become famous over the world. You'll achieve name, fame and money. Mr. Shekhar, an artist doesn't expect name and money. Nobody respects your talent in this small village. Mr. Shekhar, many people respect my talent in this village. - How would you know? - Alright, as you wish. - Son, you're leaving early. - I have to reach Lucknow in time. I'm hosting a radio program. I hope you've seen Gopi. There's no objection from my side. Whatever be your decision, I will obey it. My dear, may you live long. You have lessened my responsibility. When Gangaram returns, we'll set the marriage date and... inform you by sending a letter to your father. My son, may you live long. Give my greetings to your father, Jugal Kishore. Why are you still sitting here? Are you waiting for someone? I'm waiting for someone but she hasn't arrived. We meet someone who we've never dreamed of. Look at me. I met you twice. Remember my words. If ever you visit Lucknow, then definitely look me up. My dear, are you sewing a shirt for Kishen? - Put some stitches in his wits too. - Why, father? He seems to be in a world of his own. However, it's not his fault. He's at a difficult age. What age is that? You've grown up now. I'll have to get you married. Father, what's the hurry? My dear, I'm old now. I wish to see you married and lessen my responsibility. I am fortunate enough. God was kind to send me Kishen. Don't you like him dear? Rami, why are you shy? My dear, I know everything. You and Kishen are both my eyes. Father, there's a distance between the two eyes. However, the eyesight is the same. I'm not asking for the teacher's fees for marrying you to him. I'm offering him a gem. Father, why not ask Kishen's consent? Kishen will never disobey me. I won't waste any more time. To install Kishen. To install Kishen. Lord, what do I do now? I'm in deep trouble. I have to choose between my teacher's wish and Gopi's love. You gave me love, knowledge and shelter. How can you see my love shattered before your eyes? Love is one of your forms. Save me my lord. Save me my lord. Gopi, Gopi! Nobody can block our path to love Not even the world can We will live and die together Our love is immortal My beloved, I hope you support me all my life I hope you always keep holding my hands My beloved, I hope you always support me all my life My beloved, your love is beautiful Your love is like the sweet sound of my bangles My beloved, from the first day I was in love I desire to hear your shehnai at the threshold of my home Let the rain sound like your musical notes I hope you always keep holding my hands my beloved, I hope you support me all my life As long as the stars and the moon shine in the sky... As long as there is water in the rivers Ganga and Jamuna... that's how long I wish our love to last I am your lover for many generations to come my darling, I hope you'll always remember this night I hope you always keep holding my hands my beloved, I hope you support me all my life I want to talk to you about something important. Please tell me. Who's beating the drums in the temple at midnight? Today is Krishna Janmastami. Are you crazy? I think something fishy is going on. That scoundrel is disgracing a village girl above the temple. How can you remain calm? Do you think he's crazy about just one girl? He has his eye on every girl in the village. You'll be shocked if I take names. See with your own eyes how he kidnapped a girl... in a temple in the middle of the night. He commits two crimes at a time. It's a shame for the villagers. Hit him. Come down from there. Down with him. Everyone keep quiet. Raghunath Maharaj has come. Maharaj, you decide about him. Look how your disciple is engrossed in love. Shut up. Come down. Kishen, come down. Kishen, don't go there. Why not Gopi? It's not a sin to be in love. I won't let anyone discredit our love. Come with me. You scoundrel! I didn't give you shelter and food... so you'd humiliate me and the villagers. Gurudev, my love is pure. I don't consider my love to be a blemish. I worship my love. Oh shut up! - I'll kill you. You can kill me but my soul will always live. My soul will tell everyone that Gopi is mine. Gopi is mine. You're shameless! You scoundrel! Father! Let's go. Please stop father. Father, they'll commit suicide if they aren't united. The entire village will become a graveyard then. Father, Stop. He's ruined everything. My house has become a graveyard. I had such desires and aspirations for him. However, he's put me to shame. He has destroyed them. Gurudev, you always stood up for my dreams. You were always happy in my happiness. How can you crush my aspirations, my happiness... my desires with your wrath? Get out of here. I don't want to see your face. Father. To install lost. I warn you, don't touch my feet. You're dead to me. You [ __ ]! Didn't I tell you this girl... would bring disgrace to you? - You scoundrel! You have disgraced my name. Mother. Aunty, Gopi loves Kishen. Every villager knows about their love. Why not marry Gopi to Kishen? This relationship will bring some respect to you, aunty. What are you saying? How can I give away Gopi to a beggar? His family is unknown and has no name, no respect for itself. Gopi will marry a rich man. Do you understand? Come along you scoundrel. Aunty, aunty. 'What are you saying? How can I give Gopi away to a beggar? ' 'His family is unknown and has no name no respect for himself.' 'Gopi will marry a rich man. Do you understand? ' ' You are wasting your talent in this small village.' 'If you play the shehnai on the radio... then you'll become famous over the world.' 'You'll achieve name, fame and money.' - Kishen, come home. - Whose home are you talking about? - Our home. - It's not my home anymore. The one who nurtured me and made me big has disowned me. To install I'm a beggar. I have no home left. I'll enter this village again only after I've made a name for myself. - Rami, will you do me a favor? - What? Will you tell Gopi to wait for me? I'll definitely come back. Rami, I'll come back one day. - Where will you go? - I'll go to Lucknow. - Hey mister, ticket? - I have no ticket. You can't travel without a ticket. Step aside. Rami! Come along Kishen. Rami, you? Let's go. - Why did you come here? - Because you came here. Please go back. What will you do here and where will you live? I'll live with you. I'll look after you as I always have. There's a lot to do with my life. Rami, don't get me into even more trouble. You know the reason I was removed... from the village by your father. You also know very well for whom I've left the house. You know all this, so don't stay with me. Kishen, how can I leave you? Who will take care of you? Rami, are you my sister or mother to take care of me? Are you asking about our relationship? I'll definitely tell you some day. Now let's go. Come Kishen. Come. Congratulations! You're an artist for the Lucknow radio station. Thank you. Your shehnai will now be heard all over the world. I'll never forget my obligation to you. - If you don't mind, may I ask you something? Please do. When I asked you to come to Lucknow, you refused. What caused you to change your mind? I owe you. You've helped me. But I can't tell you the reason. I'm selling my talent so my love isn't destroyed. What's her name? Her name reigns only in my heart. I was accused of being a beggar and could not meet with her. I thought an artist shouldn't strive for fame and money. However, now I want fame, name and money. I want to show the world I'm not a beggar. I'll see my love again after I earn success. I won't re-enter the village until I achieve a name for myself. This is a matter of love. Don't worry, brother Kishen. We're sailing in the same boat. I'm also dreaming about love. What's her name? Her name reigns only in my heart. I'll pray to God that you get your beloved. It will definitely. My marriage is almost settled. Then you pray for me. My marriage isn't arranged. Don't you trust your love? I'm afraid something unfortunate might happen. I don't trust anyone. Oh just forget it. I'll arrange for your program very soon. Thank you. Good bye. - Rami, everything is going smoothly. That's great news. - I'll write a letter to father. He'll be very happy. Come. Come. It's really sad. He hasn't come out of the house since... Rami ran away with Kishen. How will he face the world? That Kishen loved Gopi and ran away with Rami. - Raghunathji, where is Rami? - She's in hell. You go to hell, too. Ramkali from Lucknow? Kashi Sangeet Sabha from Kashi. The person receiving this letter will go to Kashi. Be careful. Nowadays he's in a bad mood. His young daughter ran away from home with Kishen Shehnaiwale. His daughter ran away so you you think I will? I'm a government servant. Who'll deliver letters if I run away? Maharaj. Maharaj. - A letter. - Who's it from? It's not the letter you were expecting from Ramkali. Don't take her name. I consider her to be dead. - How can she be dead? She's living happily. Get out of my sight. I don't want any letters. I don't want to see anyone. What's the matter, Maharaj? I'm ruined. Come and watch me perform the drama. Haven't you come to see my state? Look at my uncombed hair. Watch my helpless old age and laugh at my sorrows. Have you finished enjoying? Now go away. My daughter ran away with Kishen Shehnaiwale. She has spoiled my reputation. I am waiting to die. Won't you let me die in peace? I don't believe it. Kishan can't do this. Ramkali was a decent girl. Do you think she'd run away with him? - I'm sure Kishen will return. - I don't think so. Don't say that Bindiya. Why are you crying for the one who ran away? 'We're speaking from Lucknow. Our second session has begun. 'We'd like to introduce to our listeners an amazing artist.' 'He's the disciple of Raghunath Maharaj of Radhapur.' 'His name is Kishen Shehnaiwale'. 'His shehnai will enchant our listeners for many years to come.' 'Listen to him playing the shehnai.' 'Stop playing the shehnai.' 'Please stop playing the shehnai.' It's broken My heart is broken Someone has stolen my heart My heart is broken My beloved, tell me, what was my fault? You didn't even see me once before going away You broke all relationships and walked away leaving me all alone I thought, you'd always be there to support me I have lost my beloved My heart is broken Someone has stolen my heart I am desperately in love with you I have lost my sleep and I am restless I trusted and waited for you I expected happiness but I got sorrows and grief instead The entire world is against me My heart is broken Someone has stolen my heart My heart is broken I'm missing Radhapur. I never expected to come to Lucknow. I learned to play the shehnai just to win her love. However, she's gone far away from me. I haven't received any letters or messages from her. Kishen, I've written one more letter to Gopi today. There's no point in writing her letters. Has she replied to the earlier ones? There must be some good reason for not replying to the letters. Kishen, don't you know she's not a modern girl? She must not be compelled to reply. I miss Gopi a lot. I'm thinking of seeing her again. You may go, but it'll be an obstruction to your devotion. Didn't you promise you wouldn't go to Radhapur until you've... made a name for yourself? Kishen, have patience. Love will always enlighten your path. Have faith and Gopi will definitely answer your letters. Ok. I hope it happens as you say. Oh god! A letter for Gopi from Lucknow? I won't give it to her. - Kanaiyalalji - What is it? Has the mail arrived? Of course, I'm not wasting time. Don't you have any other work? This letter is for Manohar Pandey. Don't bring this stick along. - Nanhenayal. - Yes, this is my letter. - Muhammad Phulzadi. Yes. I would've delivered the letter to your house. - No, thank you. Ali Baksh. Nawab Munne Khan Tangewale. How are you sir? - Please, my letter. - Can't you wait? This letter has no name. Please look for my letter. I'm not responsible for every letter. - These letters aren't for you. Will you take them. No. Go away. - Brother Kanaiyalal... - Brother? - Is there any letter for me? - Who'd write a letter to you? I didn't receive any letter. If there was any letter, wouldn't I deliver it to your home? Kishen Shehnaiwale, Vegetable market, Lucknow. I'll hold onto this. What a mind blowing performance! - Gopi! - Is there any letter for me? Why are you asking for letters? I have good news. Take a look at this newspaper. They make a good pair and I think we'll also make a great pair. I'll be more than happy to marry you. Kishen, how can you forget me? This is the river where you saved me. Now I'll drown myself in this river. - What are you doing? Leave me. I want to die. Let me go. Gopi, why are you alone? Where is your lover? Who are you talking about? Don't try to fool me. I have a good memory. I want to end my life. Poor thing! She's in distress. Her heart is broken. Have patience dear. Don't waste your precious life. Have faith in life. You'll have to overcome it. - We'll drop you at your house. No. Sister, are you crazy? We'll take you to your home. Suicide is a crime my dear. Love is the biggest crime. Life is full of surprises. It doesn't happen that one always succeeds in love. My dear, listen to me and your mother. Shekhar is a nice boy. I trust he'll make your life happy. Uncle, I have no feelings left. I consider myself dead. You can hand me over to anyone. Brother Gangaram, set the date for the marriage and inform us. Jugal Kishore. - The wedding will be at Ramganj, - Why there sister? Gopi and Kishen are disgraced in Radhapur. I fear the people of Radhapur will interfere in the marriage. I'll do as you wish sister. Put the luggage there. Kishen, I knew Gopi would definitely answer my letters. I think she wrote one letter every day. Dhandas, Amirchand, Bombay, National Club. I've received many letters and messages. Some want me to play the shehnai at their marriage. The others have invited me to entertain at their party. However, my life is in darkness. Where is the light of my life? Rami, I can't wait any longer. I've completed my penance. I'll visit her right away. I'm not a pauper anymore. I've achieved a name for myself. - How do you do? Please come in. - When did you arrive? - I'm sorry. I have no time to spare. - I can't attend any radio shows. - I know you're busy now. You'll attend shows in Calcutta, Delhi, Allahabad, Bombay, Benaras. To install All over India. Don't attend radio programmer, but you can't ignore a friend. Mr. Shekhar sent a message for you. A message from Mr. Shekhar? Please take a seat. What about? He's getting married at Ramganj on the tenth. I'm glad to hear that. The people have arrived. - Mr. Shekhar has requested. - Requested what? He won't marry unless you play the shehnai in his wedding. People are waiting for you. In fact, someone is waiting for me. - What did you say? Nothing. I'm already burdened by obligations to him. We'll leave tonight. You can take sis-in-law along with you. Rami, you go alone. - After you return we'll go to Radhapur. I'll come this evening. Good bye. Beloved, your love will always remain in my life, I hope my hands are in your hands forever - Gopi. Gopi. What happened? Nothing. Someone please bring water. Gopi, Gopi. 'When I grow up I'll marry Gopi.' 'Oh shut up. You'll play the shehnai at Gopi's marriage. '- I wonder sometimes, if I'll ever marry. - Don't say that. ' ' Someone will play the shehnai at your marriage. it won't be me. My childhood dreams are scattered There are no aspirations left My lover is marrying someone else... giving me pain and sorrow Never fall in love. Love is deceitful There is little happiness and more sorrow in love Never fall in love. Love is deceitful The moth comes near a lamp... but burns itself in its light The path of love is full of sorrows and hardships There is no solace or comfort on this path Never fall in love. Love is deceptive I thought the flowers would bloom I got the thorns in return It's an amazing world full of deception There is no companionship in this loneliness Never fall in love. Love is deceitful There is little happiness and more sorrow in love There is little laughter and more tears in love Never fall in love. Love is deceptive I'm sorry to say Brother Kishen isn't to be found anywhere. His fans are desperate to hear him play the shehnai. He went to attend the marriage. - That marriage was a disaster. - Why do you say so? The marriage began. The nuptial rounds were going on when the bride... collapsed after hearing the shehnai. It's really sad. Where is the bride now? Her uncle took her back to Radhapur. Radhapur! - What was the name of the bride from Radhapur? Gopi. - Gopi! - Why do you ask? Did the marriage go smoothly? The nuptial rounds were considered to be void as the... bride fainted before completing them. Sorry for troubling you. If Brother Kishen returns, then inform me immediately. - May I have a sheet of blank paper? - Of course. Thank you. Please take a seat. - Gangaramji. - Who is it? There's a letter for you. How come you came today? - Where is Kanaiya? - He's unwell. Uncle, how is Gopi? Bindi, she's the same as before. She's in her own world. She doesn't listen to anyone. Go and see her. - Who's it from? Ramkali, from Lucknow. Ramkali? Why did that [ __ ] write us a letter? Sister, don't abuse her. Let me first read the letter. My greetings to respected uncle. You haven't replied to the ten letters sent to you. Why did you arrange her marriage to Mr. Shekhar? Didn't you know about the love between Gopi and Kishen? Kishen disappeared after he played... the shehnai at Gopi's marriage. If Kishen comes to Radhapur, tell him about Ramkali who... nurtured him as a mother and loves him as a sister. I hope Gopi is alright. From your loving daughter Ramkali. Sister, we misunderstood Kishen and Ramkali. These are all rumors. Aunty, I know Gopi and Kishen are made for each other. She passed out when she heard Kishen playing the shehnai. So, only Kishen's shehnai can give her back to her senses. Gopi. Who are you calling sister? She's not herself. She's going to the place where she used to hear Kishen play... the shehnai during her childhood days. Let her go. I doubt Ramkali wrote ten letters. How is this possible brother? We haven't received a single one. Sister, postman Kanaiya is the culprit behind all this. If the new postman hadn't come then we'd have never known. I'll teach Kanaiya a lesson. Why did you leave me, Gopi? You broke my heart. - Have you come Gopi? I'm Gopi's uncle. You scoundrel! Give me all the letters. What letters are you talking about? - I'll show you. Why are you hitting me? To install I'm unwell. Give me the letters you stole. Why are you hitting me? Why not send the one to whom these letters were written? - Then I'll bear your blows happily. Oh really? - Give me the letters. - I wouldn't have stolen the letters... if you hadn't arranged Gopi's marriage. Don't speak nonsense or I'll call the police. There's no need for the police, uncle. I always keep dreaming about them. I've not only seen them but also been beaten by them. That made me weak. But it was only a dream. Otherwise it'd be worse. I'll see to it that you go to jail for 12 years. - What has my son done? Your beloved son has stolen letters. It's not a big crime. He's not stolen your property. He stole the letters and ruined many lives. He's responsible for the state of Gopi and Raghunathji. My Gopi has almost gone crazy. Raghunathji is abusing his innocent daughter. I'll go and explain to Raghunathji. And later I'll punish your beloved son. Please take these letters. Give them to the mother. Oh shut up! - Can I have a little liquor? - Go away. It's good you're drinking. You're drinking water. Why are you fooling people by selling them fake flowers? Can't you see? - You're my friend. - Get lost. My companion has separated on the path of life Nothing remains in my life now Well said. Well said. You were right. You've come at the right time. My friend, why don't you say something? I have learned to drink. I have learned to live Call it a sin or a virtuous act I have learned to drink. I have learned to live I had one beautiful reflection in my eyes A flower smiled at a wasp and he was in love Love finally appeared one day. My songs had found their rhythm. Fate has turned my songs out of rhythm. You left me alone in the middle of life. You deceived me She assaulted my love. Liquor has taught me to live without you I have learned to drink. I have learned to live people ask me why I drink. My mind asks me why I'm alive I'm not interested in drinking. I can't find another way to die life is an disease and there's no cure for it If I never had loved then I wouldn't be in this condition I had found the path to live but fate turned on me I lost my beloved on the path I was wounded and my heart broke I am dependent on this liquor now I have learned to drink. I have learned to live Call it a sin or a virtuous act I have learned to drink. I have learned to live Who are you? You seem to be in distress. Why do you ask, sister? - I live in my own world. - May I be of any help to you? Why are you talking to him? Jumanmiya, throw him out. He spoiled the show. Why are you bothering him, Jumanmiya? Don't interfere. I know you all very well. - Get out you scoundrel - Don't call me a scoundrel. To install Scoundrel. Bastard. I don't know where he came from. - Kishen! - Who are you? Kishen, what happened? To install I'm Ramkali. Let's get out of here. - Ramkali I haven't seen you for many days. Kishen. Greetings to you. Kishen. Where will you take me? He has such a nice wife. I really wonder why they come here. Kishen, Kishen. Wake up. Wake up. It's morning now. There is no daylight in my life. I apologize for last night, Ramkali. Are you apologizing for drinking liquor? I drank because I could not find any poison in the entire market. - Did drinking help you? No. The same thoughts troubled me while drinking. Ramkali, you don't know. I've gone through hell. - I know everything, but... - Postman. Father sent a letter for me. My dear daughter, accept my greetings. Your father is sending his greetings instead of blessings. It's better that you receive my greetings. Gangaram has clarified everything about you. He said you're of clean character. You have taught the world a lesson. A pure relationship can exist between a young boy and a girl. There is bad news along with this good news. Gopi isn't in her right mind. Her illness is psychological. Kishen's shehnai is the only medicine for her sickness. Kishen's shehnai! I'll never play the shehnai. I played it out of love for her and stopped after her marriage. - You'll never play the shehnai again? No. The shehnai was yours but Gopi was the lyrics. The rhythm was yours but those were Gopi's songs. The rhythm has ended. I took an oath never to play the shehnai again. Your shehnai echoed the songs of Gopi. You can't take such an oath without her permission. Don't compel me to play it Ramkali. I've broken the shehnai. You'll have to repair both the shehnai and the relationship. The whole world will blame me for the failure of your relationship. I beg of you. Won't you play the shehnai? Won't you play the shehnai? Your love for Gopi was selfish. Can you see Gopi die? Rami! Ramkali, I want Gopi to live. I'll definitely play the shehnai. The rhythm from the shehnai to a broken heart... will grant a new life to Gopi. - Kanhaiya - Who is it? - My dear, it's your uncle - Uncle! - How are you? - Why don't you give me news of the village? - I have a letter for you. - Don't talk to me about letters. - Kishen Shehnaiwale - Is he dead? He's not dead. He is coming to the village. This is bad news for me. God, I never expected anything from you. Today, I'm asking you to give me the strength to play... the shehnai marvelously so that it saves Gopi's life. My Lord, my Lord... you can take away my rhythm, my shehnai and my life. God help save my love. Gangaramji, she won't live for long. It's a hopeless case. Only God can save her. Good bye. - Gopi - Sister. There's no use crying. We tried to save her in every possible way. We gave her the best possible medical treatment... but I think fate has turned against us. Kishen. It was a mind blowing performance. - Gopi - Gopi. Gopi, dear. Kishen. Baba. Forgive me Kishen. - Gopi, see Kishen has come. - Kishen has come? Why has he come now? My dear, you were crazy about him. Uncle, what happened to me? You came to your senses from hearing Kishen's shehnai. You can marry Kishen. It's alright, Mr. Gangaram. I'm already married. Kishen, you kept your promise but I couldn't. Why did you come? I didn't want to come. However, I couldn't see you in this state. My shehnai was useful to save your life. I'm the greatest shehnai player in the entire world. - I'm only waiting for death to come. - Don't ever say that. I have the vermillion on my head. I have the bangles. These are the signs of a married woman. If you call me I'll drop everything and come to you. Don't talk like that. I came to restore your health, not to destroy you. I'm not here to interfere with your duty. You follow your virtues and religion. To install Live happily. Gopi, you and Kishen can meet again. The vermilion on your head has no meaning. I can't marry again. Kishen is a stranger to me. Marriage is a union of two hearts. We have realized our mistake. What about the person who married me? Uncle, take me to my in laws. I hope I don't forget my responsibility. Take me to them before I'm stigmatized. If you forget me and go away from me... my love is so powerful that it'll bring you back to me. We both should succeed. We both should make love succeed Your rhythm and my songs will succeed Gopi. Get up my dear. We've arrived at Lucknow. Gopi wake up. - My greetings, Uncle. Gopi, Mr. Shekhar has come. Gopi, Gopi. Her entire body has turned cold. Gangaramji, how did this happen? Her soul has reached Kishen. The body is with you. This is the tomb of both lovers, Kishen and Gopi. This is Ramkali. She lit the lamp before his tomb. - She offers flowers. - She's the witness of true love. She sacrificed her life for the happiness of the two lovers. She's the greatest example of true love. Many years have passed by. However, people will never forget Kishen playing his shehnai... Gopi for her selfless love and Rami for her sacrifice. After all, true love is immortal.
