Maybe we can find a name that will ring a bell. Let me help. I don't blame you for losing your temper. Amnesia's one of the most unnerving things that can happen to a person. You're not really sick and yet you're not yourself. Look in the mirror and say, "who am I? Where did I come from?" And you have what we call a general amnesia. Your past is a total blank. What are my chances of getting better? Tell me the truth. Your wallet, your driver's licence, social security, they were all in your coat. If they hadn't been burned, we'd have something to go on to... Help you find your way back. Of course, that's not to say it's hopeless. One of these days, the part of your brain that remembers will start working again. How, we don't know, but it just happens that way. When will that be? Well, I won't lie to you, I don't know. Could be soon, it might be months... It might even be years. Oh, that looks better. Yeah. Now, that's much better. You'll soon be able to use those just as good as ever. How good is that? How do I know? Maybe they could box, paint a house, play a violin. Although you don't look much like a violin player to me. I'm checking out, doctor. It's time I started looking for myself. It's some racket, amnesia. Yeah, if you know when to pull it. You just say to your wife, "how do I know why I didn't come home last night? I've got amnesia in the head!" Amnesia in the head! Hey, that's a good one! I gotta use that gag myself! Yeah, just tell 'em you caught it from a pal! - Yeah, like a cold. - Yeah. Hey, you know, I think I'm getting it now. Where's my paintbrush? Do you know where my paintbrush is? Take it easy! What's the matter with you, anyway? This pays you up through today, bonus and all. Sign here. That's 739 dollars and 50 cents. Ain't you got no feelings? You just nearly killed a man. I've had a bellyful of you for two years. We've got a hospital for accident cases and we don't need you to keep it filled. Hi, hon! - Chuck just blew in from this trip back east. - Yeah? Lori and me are just having a drink, for old time's sake. Yeah. You know I wouldn't step out on you, hon. You took away from me fair and square. - No hard feelings. - Beer, Tom. I was hoping I'd run into you, pal. Just came back from your part of the country. - What's my part of the country? - Are you kidding? Where you come from? Nobody knows where I come from, not even me. Well, let me go and I'll tell you. Every heard of a town called lyncastle? - Nice burg, busy, wide open. - Alright, skip the travelogue. Sure, sure. Well, anyway, I was walking down the main drag and what do you think I see? - Your face. - His face? Where? In a store window, photographer's place. You know, they always have a lot of pictures in the window. - Who did he say I am? - Didn't know. He was a new guy. Just bought out the joint. He was clearing all the old faces out of the window. So I bought yours, just for old time's sake. Lyncastle, huh? Where is that? Across the state line, about seven or eight hundred miles. - So when are we leaving, hon? - I'm leaving now. I'm travelling light. Here, Chuck, it's all yours. Well, how do you like that? That's gratitude! And after all I've done for him, too. Take it easy, baby. I've never been to lyncastle in my life. This is the picture I really got from the post office upstate. Johnny McBride? That must be his real name, huh? Murder? It might have been me. I got the photo from this thing. Was that a smart idea or was that a smart idea? Well, he fell for it. Hey, Tom, you got a bottle of that high-class champagne? We're celebrating. Hey, uh, mack, uh... Is there a good hotel near here? Sure. The lyncastle hotel, two blocks down, turn to the right. Thanks. Operator. Room 502. Thank you. Lyncastle hotel. Room 404. Thank you. Do you know me? What gave you that idea? You were looking at me as if you did. Couple of gals were staring at you. All I did was follow their eyes and hit you. I couldn't very well miss, it's such a big target. Your party's on the line, miss. Thank you. Lyncastle hotel. Yes, we do. Well, I'll try to connect you, sir. Johnny! Johnny boy! This is great. You must have got everything fixed up. Sure glad to see you. Yeah. Glad to see you too. It's been a long time, Johnny. Yeah. Couple of years, maybe more. Just about two years. Where you been? In the oil fields. Look, uh, I'm kinda bad on names. What's yours? Are you kidding, Johnny? What's the matter with you? Well, it just slipped my mind, that's all. But you couldn't forget me. Pop Henderson. Oh, yeah, yeah. Pop Henderson. We're old friends, huh? You bet. We must have a lot to talk about, the old days, people we knew. I'll be off duty in a couple of hours. Go on up to your room. I'll come up later. Front. Take Mr. McBride to 408. Ten bucks? Yes, sir. - You know this town well? - Backwards. Yes, sir. I'm a great guy for asking questions. This green stuff makes me very talkative. I'll send for you when I need you. Yes, sir. That's him alright. The driver recognized him when he got off the bus. What do you want? We're police officers. You're coming with us. What for? Come on. Why you! Wait a minute, Tucker, wait a minute! Now, what am I charged with, besides resisting an officer? Murder. Just murder. That's all. Who told you to come back here? Some smart lawyer with a fancy trick up his sleeve? Well, it won't do you any good. Just because it's two years doesn't mean we haven't still got a case. Because we've got a piece of evidence that doesn't lie. It says for sure that you're the killer. Alright, let's get moving. Oh, sure, sure. Anyone can forget a little thing like a crime. You don't remember? You don't remember! It's guys like you playing innocent that spoils my appetite. I suppose you've never even heard of the lyncastle bank? You don't remember being a teller there and taking 250 grand out of it? How much dough do you have to take out of a bank before you remember it? One thing I do remember, in the hotel you guys said murder. Yeah, and murder it is. Maybe we haven't got a case for the jury on the amount of dough that you took from the bank, but we've got you dead to rights on the killing. You have? I don't remember. Alright, McBride, look, I'll go along with you. I'll try to refresh your memory. - Here, have a cigarette? - No, thanks. One fine night a couple of years ago, a man by the name of minnow was sitting in his home behind his desk working on some papers. A minute later he was dead. Cause of death? A bullet hole. From what? A .38. Who fired the gun? You. Why did you do it? Because minnow was the district attorney. What was he doing to you? He was going to prove you took the 250 g's out of the bank so you plugged him. Remember that? Okay, then. Here, take a look at this. So you didn't think we had it on you, huh? In case you don't know it, McBride, these are your fingerprints, taken right off the gun that did the killing. These three were on the butt. That one was too and that one was on the trigger that you squeezed. Now, what do you think of that? Wanna try to prove that, captain? That's exactly what I'm gonna do. Come here. What did you do to your finger? Hey! He ain't got no fingerprints! What happened to them? They're gone, burned off in an accident. Don't give us that. That's an old one, even Dillinger used it. Well, if you fellas aren't gonna take my fingerprints... - You'll stick around till I'm through with you! - Wait a minute, tuck. Knock it off! But look, McBride, just because you haven't any prints doesn't mean we're licked. We have other ways of tying you into the murder. And don't bother keeping in touch with us, we'll keep in touch with you. - Hello. - Sorry, Mr. McBride. There's no answer from pop's house. - He'll be on duty soon. - Yeah, thanks. Oh! Oh, by the way, where's the public library? Just across the park. You can't miss it. Thanks. Shh! Sorry. Reading your press notices? - What are you, a cop? - Uh-uh, reporter. Name's Logan, Alan Logan. I wrote that story when it broke. I wrote the one in this morning's paper too, amnesia and all. A Logan special. Say, I'd like to see those fingertips of yours. Go win yourself a pulitzer prize. Who's the girl? Yours. At least she was until you skipped. A week later she ran out too. What happened to her? Vera west, 22 years old. - That would make her 24 now, blonde... - Blonde wasn't the word for it. Honey blonde and real, and it didn't come out of any bottle. Why did you print her description? They hoped somebody would spot her. Besides being your girl, she worked with you at the bank. They figured she'd know something. Maybe how you doctored the books or where you might have run to after you killed minnow. I never killed anybody. How do you know? You were just the kinda of a guy to run away. Shh! Take it easy. The way I heard it, when you came home from the war, you had a load of medals. But you were scared of everything. Once they had a burglar alarm drill at the bank and when the gong went off they tell me you almost passed out. - You turned yellow. - Just give me a reason! I'd say you're guilty, McBride. You've got it in you to kill a man. Johnny, wait a minute! Come on, pop. - Johnny! - Pop! Hey, pop! Easy. Get a doctor, will you? Easy, pop. I... I came to tell you... Vera is here. Been here for over a year now. She never... She never told anybody but me. I was the only one she could trust. I've got to see her, pop. You'd never know her. Sure I will. I've got an old picture of her. Ah, she... she looks... different. She... she changed... Her face. You can find her at... At... Pop? Where pop? Servo. Pop? - Hello. - Hello. I know you. I know you. I know more about you after reading the morning paper. I just heard the five o'clock news. Pop Henderson was a friend of mine. How did you get to know pop so well? He took care of me when I first hit town. When was that? What difference does it make? A year ago, maybe more. I want to see Mr. Servo. What shall I say you want to see him about? Just say it's me, Johnny McBride. He'll want to see me. If my memory serves me right. There's a Mr. McBride to see you. Have him come in. What do you want, killer? Ajob? Money? Sympathy? - I just want to talk to you. - What about? - Murder. - We don't want any. You must be pretty sure of yourself to let one of your mugs sit at your desk. I told you this guy wasn't on the level. He remembers you. He ain't lost his memory. Oh, you can have amnesia and still be a smart cookie. How do you know he isn't me? Oh, I can always tell a large shot from a very small shot. What type of amnesia have you got? What they call... general or partial? - What are you, a doctor or something? - Nah. I know all about everything. If I haven't got it up here... It's in the encyclopedias. I see by the paper, you're in town, little boy, so I started reading up on amnesia. - Care to see? - No. I'm more interested in what's up there. - Like, who shot pop Henderson? - I don't know. Whoever did it used a silencer. Does that help you? Nope. Alright. Who killed minnow? Every time I talk to the cops, they say you did. Now, you don't want me to lose faith in the police department. I thinking, suppose I didn't do it. I'm thinking minnow was killed because he was trying to clean up this town. You're not thinking, you're just hoping. Okay. I'm hoping you killed him. Or one of your laddies. Eddie, don't slug him. Sometimes a hit on the head brings back the memory. Take a little tip from me, McBride, you're better off the way you are now. Like they tell you when you're a kid. What you don't know won't hurt you. What are you scared of? Nothing, no time, never. It's 18 minutes past five. I'll give you just two hours to get out of this town. Nah! I'll give you three. But don't forget, because if you do, I'm not calling it amnesia. I'm calling it suicide. - High-class people you work for. - Hey! Take it easy. Come on. Have a cigarette. A drink would taste better now. When wouldn't it? Can you get out? It's almost quitting time. - Well? - Sure. I know a cosy little bar where we won't be bothered by a lot of people. Must have been quite an interview. Ah, great. I found out something very important. There's one thing servo's afraid of. For me to get my memory back. Well... Aren't you coming in? The last chance saloon. Complete with floor show. Why don't you make yourself at home? Well, that's exactly what I've been doing today. A couple of hours ago, I was down on locus street in a boarding house. - How come? - Well, that's where I used to live. So the cops told me. There was a different dame running the place. She didn't know me. But I saw my old room. I went in, looked around, sat in a chair for a long time and I tried to remember. Any luck? I can't say for sure. No more than when I came in here. Well, anyhow, make yourself at home. Bury those memories, Johnny. Come on, let's live it up a little. Man, you're smooth. Like we've been stepping together for years. Could it be that I have known you for years? Does that help you make up your mind? Well... I don't know yet. Come here. Well, Mr. Detective, got enough clues? Why did you go brunette? What gave you that idea? The texture of the hair. Complexion. It all goes with a blonde. You certainly know your blondes, don't you? No girl could ever fool you. Not for a minute. Wait for me. I won't be long. Dry it, Johnny. See if you can rub any dye off. Making like a detective to find a gal is a pretty tough job. Oh! Don't move! Now move, real slow. Come on. Two hundred feet straight down. And it sounds like it. Go put out that light. - Okay, over you go. - Wait a minute! Untie him first, then it'll look like an accident. Like he slipped and fell. - Where'd he go? - I don't see him! Don't let him get away! - I think he's over there! - Don't lose him! There he is! It's Harry. Aaaaagh! No check, it's a hot car. Well, I ain't gonna touch no hot car, boss. Don't worry. I took it... it belongs to some friends of Mr. Servo's. - Is he in? - Well, I don't reck... And who are you, anyway? Just a customer looking for a little action. How did he get loose? Those jerks! This guy needs special treatment. Is Vera working here tonight? I don't know any Vera, but we have a Molly. Who's Molly? - Want to play? - Yeah. Got any ideas? Buy some chips. - Who are you? - The name's Wendy Miller. I'm the floor manager here. - I want to talk to you. - Sure I'll talk. What do you want to know? The wheels are straight, the dice aren't loaded, we pay up promptly. Now, do you want action or don't you? That's what I came in for. Stick around and bring me luck. Seven a loser. Pay the back line. - What's the limit? - 200. 200 on the line. - You're change, sir. - Seven a winner! Pay the line. - How much on 11? - Twenty-five. Pay up! Eleven a winner! Pay the line. - Come on. - Come on. Make it pay. Four a winner! That's amazing! The luck of the man! Eight's the point. A hundred the hard way. Eight the winner, the hard way. Amazing! Wanna talk? Cash me in. - Oh, no! - No! What's the matter? You look frightened. Are you afraid of me? A little maybe. Why because you think I killed a man? Are you scared of servo? Yes. Afraid to talk? That depends. What about? A girl. Vera west. There's nothing I can tell you about her. There's a locked door up here. Vera's got the key. Maybe when it's open I won't like what's inside and... But good or bad, I'm gonna tear the town apart. - I've got to find her. - That's your business. But you know how girls are. Maybe she won't want you to. Your money, sir. Here's your money. And with it goes some friendly advice. Don't press your luck. I used up a lot of it tonight. Oh, here. Give this to your boss. Tell him there's three men waiting for him down the road. He can't miss them. If he waits till morning, he can see daylight through one of them. Another he might not recognize. He had his nose and mouth mashed with a .45. The third one. Well, he'll have to pick up the pieces. Fell on some rocks 200 feet below. Oh, why don't your pay your help around here a little more? You're gonna hire blondes, don't let the black roots show. Hi, junior. Thanks for the message. Forget the apologies. I guess we both lost our tempers. I was over at the newspaper. They told me where you lived. Hey, you're up kinda early, aren't you? - Haven't been to bed yet. - Oh? This doesn't exactly cure insomnia. It keeps your mind occupied, so you don't mind it. Seen the newspaper? Yeah. ?Three men slain in quarry." Care to make a statement on the crimewave? I went down with the cops last night to see the place. Looked like commando stuff to me. I wouldn't know about that. I don't remember much about the war or what I did in it. You did pretty well. The memory may be gone, Johnny, but the instinct lingers on. Between you and me, that's just what's been on my mind. I need your help. - Is there a story in it for me? - Sure. Even if it's only an obituary. Somebody's trying to shoot me up for good. Why? Mm, I should say because you've been going around asking questions. Yeah. I don't like the answers I've been getting. So I'm starting back at the beginning. Now, this gun minnow was killed with, how did they know it was mine? Because it's the same one you had when you worked at the bank. Every teller has one. Could anyone else get a hold of it? With your fingerprints? Come on in the house, Johnny, and have a cup of coffee. What are you trying to do? Pick up another quarter of a million? Hello, Johnny. Oh, uh, I'm Tucker of homicide. I'll take care of this, Mr. Gardiner. Oh, Mr. Gardiner. You're the man who owns the bank. Yes, I'm the president. It's quite alright, officer. I heard you were in town, Johnny. I didn't know whether you'd stop in to see me. Well, here I am. They tell me I used to work here. I'll show you exactly where, the sort of thing you used to do. Your own window and money drawer. Familiar things help us to remember, Johnny. It might help you. Thanks, Mr. Gardiner, that's what I thought. You won't recall Jennings. He came after you left. This is Johnny McBride, Jennings. - How do you do? - Hello, Mr. McBride. Johnny, this used to be your window here. Does, uh... Does each teller have his own gun? - Just his, nobody else's? - Yes. - Did I have my own when I worked here? - Yes, you did, Johnny. Was that the gun that was found on minnow's desk when he was killed? I'm afraid it was, Johnny. - If there's anything I can do... - As a matter of fact, I'd like to open a checking account. If you're not afraid to trust a bank that has a tendency to lose a quarter of a million dollars. Oh, I think my money's safe, Mr. Gardiner. After all, I don't work here anymore. Well, Jennings will take care of you. Yes, sir. Who's servo's girl? Leave that alone. There's plenty just as good. Who is she? Your funeral. Just now it's a babe named Troy avalon. Write down the address over there. Yes, sir. J? the one and only comes along j? - j? once you took my hand j? -J? my hand j? j? I felt your touch and I was strong j? j? the wonder of a simple love j? j? was not too clear to me j? j? though you were dear to me j? Miss, uh... Troy avalon? Yes. Does Mr. Servo happen to be here? Not now. - How soon do you expect him? - Not for hours. I bet your name is Johnny McBride. Yeah. You win. So do you. - How did you guess who I was? - It was easy. Servo and packman were talking about you. I figured a guy who would bust into servo's office the way you did would go anywhere. And here you are. What gave you the idea you'd find servo in my place? I took a gallup poll. Ninety-nine per cent of those questioned said, "no comment." So naturally I came up here. Seems like I got a break. I'm looking for a girl. How come a guy like you has to look for a girl? The one I had ran out on me. - You still carrying a torch? - No. Just a picture. That your type? I'm looking for something a little different just now. I go for blondes. You always been a blonde? I was a brunette in my last show. What were you before that? Platinum, same as now. Oh, mister! I haven't been kissed like that in along, long time. How long? Well, I've been going with servo for over a year. Ever since you arrived in lyncastle? Oh, no, I came back before then. You came back? Then you lived here before. Look, let's play something else besides 20 questions. You know pop Henderson? Say, what's the idea of grilling me? Did servo send you here trying to pin something on me? Is this a plant? Is he gonna walk in on us? Take it easy, take it easy. I'm on the level with you. I wouldn't get you in a jam. - Then why all the third degree business? - Oh... What's wrong with a guy getting to know a girl a little better? - Do you really want to? - Sure. Tell you what... Let's got out somewhere, huh? - I can't, I haven't anything to wear. - Yeah. I bet you haven't bought a new dress in all of two days. I haven't a thing to wear, go look! Don't you ever go out? When servo takes me. - Well, what do you wear? - Oh, lots of things. Suits, evening dresses. Sport dresses, ermine wrap, mink coat. Another mink coat. They're all in here. What? Nice boy that servo. A careful boy. What's in here? Nylons! Well, it's... it's better than nothing. What does servo do, grow this stuff? He does better than that, he owns the store. Servo owns a dame shop? And a hotel and a mortgage company, and three restaurants and a casino. Servo owns everything, absolutely everything in this town, Johnny. Do things in this town like being owned by servo? As far as I know, they do. Or at least, that's what they have to say. But they don't always mean it... Sometimes. And this is our latest fashion. - Good morning, sir. - Good morning. Ah, it's pretty fancy. It's a bridal garter. What's this written on it? ?Honi soit qui mal y pense... - Come again? - It's French. It means "evil to him who evil thinks". Oh, I get it. Along, long time ago, a king said it when a beautiful lady dropped her garter at court. I'll remember that next time I'm in court. Say, do you have something nice I could send a date tonight? Uh, nothing bridal. What about some perfume? This is very nice. Yeah. - Are you Venus? - Yes. Professional name. Good as any. As good as your real one? Better. Say, could a woman change her looks with this stuff? Mmm. Not much. Of course, she could change her hair, that's a cinch. Of course. I guess if a woman was serious about it she wouldn't use a makeup table, she'd use an operating table. Those plastic surgeons are pretty good at changing faces, nose, chin, anything, huh? That sounds like a lot of trouble for a girl to go to, Johnny. You know my name. You know, for a guy who's only been in town a couple of days, I'm, uh... Quite a celebrity. How well do you know me? Would you sign this, please? Thank you. What's your real name? Knowing that wouldn't help. - I wish I could help you. - Then why don't you? Who's stopping you? What's stopping you?! Thank you very much. Do come in again. Johnny! Do you want the perfume? Yeah. Send it to Carol shay. You know where she works. You have the same boss. Get down! What was that? Somebody took a shot at us. I didn't hear a gun. It had a silencer on it. That's where it came from. It was fired from there alright. It could have come from either room. Wonder who's been shooting at our little boy now? The way I figure, must have been somebody. Little boy had better be careful. They might shoot again. Not while you're next to me. Nobody's gonna take a chance knocking off the boss. Ooh! It's okay, folks, nothing happening. Just a little horsing around. Not in here! You'll scare the customers. Are you gonna let him get away with that? Just for tonight. Come on. What did you do with the gun? Gun? What gun? You don't know anything about it, huh? I don't know anything about it. What makes you think I'd want to shoot you? Because servo told you to. And you wouldn't be impolite and say no. When you're through taking the place apart maybe you'll listen to me. First of all, I didn't shoot you. - Then who did? - I don't know. - Who killed minnow? - I don't know that either. Are you gonna tell me? Where's the gun? It was fired from that window. And this says it was. You rested it here. It's the only way you can get a steady aim with a silencer on. When you fired it, it kicked and chipped the windowsill. The gun's marked now. You can never get the scratches off the barrel. - I haven't been in this room in weeks. - You're a liar! Alright then, don't believe me. I was in my office. I was coming from there when you saw me on the stairs. Uh. Thatl believe. You're wasting your time. I didn't even hear a gun. I did hear someone running in high heels. Yeah. I bet you did. Nobody asked you to come around here, McBride. Last night, you couldn't get rid of me with some friendly advice. Tonight, you're tried to do it with a gun, didn't you? My arm, you've hurt it! You've broken it. Hold me, Johnny, I'm scared. Hold me tight. Love me. Enlargements of every picture, every snapshot of Vera west I could dig up. You can't make me believe a girl can change her face so I wouldn't know her. It's a cinch. With plastic surgery they can makeover your face so your own mother wouldn't recognize you. Nah, it doesn't make sense. I used to see that Vera dame in the bank. She can't be in town, I don't believe it. Believe it or not, the word is to find Vera west. And you've got to do it in the next 24 hours. There isn't a woman working for me that hasn't been checked and double-checked. The word is to triple-check the four girls McBride's working on. Now, there's Wendy. Twice he's been to see that dame. There's Carol. He took her home from here the other day. And Venus. He was in the store with her. And there's Troy. He paid her a little visit when you weren't there. - Look, nobody visits my girl. - He did. Your encyclopedia don't tell you everything. If he did, I'll take care of them both personally. This isn't personal, this is business. If one of those four tomatoes is Vera, then all we've got to do is give McBride a good going over. - He'|I tell us which one it is. - That won't get you anywhere. It's my guess that even McBride don't know her. She's much too smart to tip her mitt to him till she gets what she's after. And you know what that is. She goes to a doctor, gets chopped and chiseled. She changes her face. Why? Because she's working undercover, an inside job. The architect's sent over the blueprints. Bring them in. I guess we'll have to call a little meeting of the ladies aid. And you stick with McBride. Mr. McBride. How would you like to go outside for a bit while Mr. McBride and I have a little chat, hmm? - Johnny, this is my grandson. - Oh, hi. If you'll go outside, I'll promise to have the boat all finished by the time you get back. Is it a deal? Come along, Tony. He brings me these little construction jobs. - Sit down, Johnny. - Thank you. There's a check over there on the desk for you. Enough I should think to live on for quite some time. I'd like you to leave lyncastle. Go to New York or anywhere you wish. I'm getting pretty sick of this, Mr. Gardiner. The cops work me over, somebody takes a shot at me. Three characters tried to take me for a ride and now you want me to get out of town. Now, don't get excited, Johnny. Hear me out first. Lyncastle used to be a nice place to live in. A healthy place in which to bring up children. Then servo moved in and with him racketeering. Now, there's a decent element in this town, too. Substantial citizens, businessmen and I'm talking for them. When minnow was alive, there was a good chance of getting this town cleaned up. But since minnow died... We haven't had a district attorney with courage and integrity enough to do the job. So you're sure I killed him, huh? I'm on your side, Johnny. But since you came back there's been nothing but violence. Now, I'm not blaming you. But we'd like you to stay away until we get a new district attorney and a better law enforcement setup. And that's all there is to it. - Will you accept the check? - No, sir. And I'm not walking out now. That's up to you, Johnny. It's all finished, Tony. - Hi. - Hello, Johnny. Come in. Let me take your hat. It was very nice of you to call tonight, very nice. I was at loose ends, I had nothing to do. - How about a drink? - Fine. You drink bourbon. How do you know that? How do you know what I drink? You remember that? No, I don't, Johnny. You just look like a bourbon man to me. Now, let's see, what did I do with those glasses? I always think a drink tastes better out of the right kind of glass. How did you get the name of Venus? I thought you'd figured that yesterday. It's not much of a change from Vera. Vera west. Don't tell me you never heard of her. Everybody else in this town has. Vera. You're in love with that name. Or are you in love with the girl? Can't you remember that? I'm not talking about love. I saw you last night. I wouldn't have liked it if you'd taken me out and left me the way you left Carol. Wendy's very pretty. And very likeable. Yep. Even loveable. Next question. You wouldn't answer it. You're too discreet. A woman... Especially an impulsive woman, finds that a reassuring quality in an attractive man. Let's get real friendly and confidential, let our hair down. Start telling our right names. This may not flatter your male vanity but... I'm half inclined to feel quite safe with you. Only half inclined though. I'll settle for that. For now. I flattered you quite enough last night. I couldn't drive you and Wendy out of my mind. Does that surprise you? I don't want to talk about Wendy and me. Only about you and Vera. It might help beat a murder rap. If there were anything I could do to help I'd do it. A girl never knows what she'd do for a guy. Hello? Yes. Oh, no, I'm terribly sorry, I couldn't possibly make it tonight. I'm busy. Well, if it's that important. Hold the line. Johnny. I'm terribly sorry, but I have to go out. Can we meet later? Sure. Alright, I'll be there. Thanks. It'll only be a short meeting. Keep the girls here until the casino closes. Then it'll be nice and lonely over there and they can yell their heads off. 0h, servo, please, I... Oh! Uh! Alright, so you're not Vera. And you're not. And you're not. And you're not. Now, three of you are telling the truth and one of you is lying. And nobody's leaving here till I find out who. Ah, let's really work 'em over. Why do you want to do that, Eddie? These dames are all ladies and we're gentlemen. A gentleman wants to find out something from a lady, he asks her. If she don't answer, well, what can you do?! Keep your hands off me, servo. I still think we ought to throw a scare into 'em. Oh, these are very brave girls, Eddie, you gotta admit that, but I know how to scare one of them. But I know what Vera's afraid of. Vera's afraid of seeing her Johnny boy get hurt, so you know what we'll do? We'll bring Johnny boy in here and we'll take him apart, right in front of all four of you. And we'll take him apart real fancy and one of 'em will crack and that'll be Vera. Go round up McBride and bring him in here. Now, you could save him a lot of hospital bills if one of you said you were Vera right now! I'll say it, if that'll make you lay off him. Well, are you? What difference does it make? I'll say it. Look, servo, you're a smart operator. You know a lot about women. But you could be playing this all wrong. Maybe Vera won't crack. How do you figure? - Maybe Vera hates him. - Why should she hate him? She got tied up with him, a guy who was no good. He ran away and her holding the bag. Could be. Could be. Maybe she'd like to see him get his. You mean, she'd just sit here enjoying it? Why not? Depends on how squeamish she is. Yeah, makes sense. Guess we might as well call it a night. You tried to con me out of bringing McBride in by pretending it doesn't matter if he's hurt or not. Why? Because it does matter. And you know who that makes you? Vera. You're crazy. How could I put a thing like that over on you? Look at her, packman. You'd never know she was lying, would you? You've known me for two years, servo. Have I ever lied to you. Yeah, for two years. Kept saying your name was Venus. Well, it's not Vera. As for bringing McBride in, I don't like to see anybody hurt. It's not my line. To me, he's just another guy. You're all wrong, servo, can't you see that? She's on the level with you. Don't butt in or you'll get a taste of what she's gonna get. No, servo, please! I'm not Vera. I swear I'm not Vera! If you're the lady who was supposed to call, he waited until half past 12. Then when out with Mr. Logan of the paper. Who knows where they went. Sure I know it's after three, but he's not back. Okay. What's the message? Here it is. I'm a friend of Venus. They've taken her to that place along the river. Used to be a power station. Tell him to give it to him the minute he comes in. Don't forget to give him that message as soon as he comes in, okay? Hey, clerk! These Mexican dogs can't get used to American time. Yes, sir. Oh, I have a message for you. Lady said I was to be sure and give it to you the minute you came in. Hey, Joe, where's my key? I don't know. I'll let you in with the pass key. Come on, senhorita. There it is, right where you left it. Yes, sir. I couldn't wait to see you, Johnny. The moment we closed I dashed away. Look, I didn't even change my dress. As I was coming into the hotel, the bell-hop was taking out that ridiculous dog. I waited my chance and got your key. - And here I am. - Busy down at the casino? - Yes. - Big crowd? Jammed. Just closed, huh? Yes, I told you. I didn't even take time to change. I passed by an hour ago with Logan. There were only two cars in the parking lot, servo's and packman's. The door was locked. What was going on? A special game for servo? Who won and who lost? I don't keep track of servo and packman. I thought you'd be glad to see me instead of asking me a lot of questions. I've been counting the hours, darling. Doesn't that mean anything to you? Yeah, yeah. Sure, some other time. What about Venus? It doesn't make sense to me. It's beginning to, to me. No, Johnny! No, Johnny! No, they'll kill you! They'll kill you if you go after her! That's why I came up here, Johnny, to stop you. I don't want them to get you. Why did they take her? Why did they take her? You're holding out on me! Servo said he was given 24 hours to find Vera. - Who gives servo orders? - I don't know! Carol, Troy, Venus and I were there. They were slapping us around. They were going to bring you in to beat you up, but then I... Venus tried to save you and right away servo said she was Vera. You can't save her! You've got to save yourself! Johnny, don't go! I love you. Wait a minute, Johnny! What if I told you I was Vera? I wouldn't believe you. You'd tell me anything to keep me from going. You'd tell me that you're Vera or Carol is, or Troy. She'll be able to talk in a minute. She'd better talk this time. We haven't got all night. Little boy wakes up slow. Little boy will hurt his wrists doing that. Say, Eddie, go out and see where this guy parked his car. We don't want this too public. Johnny boy wanted to find his Vera. And now he's found her, they're going to go real steady for the rest of their lives. Maybe for almost five minutes. What do you think about that? You heard me. What do you think about it? I was thinking about something else. I was thinking about a story, a story about a king and a lady. Make it funny, I need a laugh. That's what the story's about. People laughed at the lady, dirty laughs. But the king stopped them. He said evil to him... Who evil thinks. - You know the story? - No, and I don't like it. Do you know it, Venus? Some kind of French words go with this story. Wish I could remember them. Packman must have really decked you. You ought to have your head examined. Maybe they'll do it at the postmortem. Servo. Can I kiss my fella once more? Well, sure. I'm as silly as anybody about love. Go ahead. Stand up, run over, throw your arms around him. A little bit of rope isn't gonna stop you. You're doing great! Keep it up! Run for a touchdown! Got to call an offside penalty on that. That'll cost you five yards. Third down, two to go. What a shame packman ain't back to see this. He's a regular cupid. Can you make it to the back of the chair? Yes. Shoot it loose, shoot it. Shoot it! I'll hit you. I'll spread my hands apart. Come on, come on, it's alright! Go on, shoot! Didn't expect you back tonight. Did you finish it? Yeah, just. Nice job, Logan. You think it'll work? Did once before. There's no other way to figure it. Wow! What hit you? Care to make a statement? It's only half a story now. You'll get the rest by morning. An exclusive. A Logan special. - Good hunting, Johnny. - Thanks. Give me police headquarters. Let me talk to captain Lindsey. Captain Lindsey? I have something here that might be of great importance on the Johnny McBride case. My name is Vera west. Tuckeh Tucker, wake up! It's me, yes. I've got a visitor. Johnny McBride. Yes, yes, yes. Get here as soon as you can. I may need help. And come in through the garden, Tucker. Oh! It's you. I thought it was a burglar. Thank heaven I missed. What a shock you gave me. Oh! But, Johnny... You really were breaking into my house, you know. Now you've added burglary to the rest of your crimes. I was looking for something and I found it. You see these scratches? You got them at the casino that night you took a shot at me. I never took a shot at you or anyone else until tonight. And I only did that because a man has a right to defend himself against illegal entry. An honest man doesn't use a silencer on his gun, Mr. Gardiner. With your reputation, you're hardly the one to call another man dishonest. When I came back in, the police said I was a murderer. For all I knew, they were right. Now I know I'm not. You see, Mr. Gardiner, losing your memory makes you mind work sharper. Now, the average person remembers things but half the time he remembers wrong. A guy with amnesia has nothing to fog his mind. He's got nothing to remember. So he makes deductions like a detective. Now the way I see it, servo blew into town three years ago and he needed money. Where did he go? To a banker. Only he was too smart to go to the bank, so instead he came to your house. How many men have 250 thousand dollars in cash to invest in an operation such as yours? - Maybe you have, Mr. Gardiner? - No, I haven't. - But your bank has. - That's the depositors' money, not mine. Always technicalities. Nevertheless, I won't lend you the money. But I may decide to give it to you, Mr. Servo. Yes, that's right. Hand it over for 51 per cent of your profits. - And I give the orders. - 51 per cent? I have overheads, protection to pay... Always technicalities, Mr. Servo, always technicalities. It's preposterous! It's a lie! One thing is not a lie, Mr. Gardiner. You can't take 250 thousand dollars out of a bank without somebody catching on, especially a bank examiner. It was a cinch. You had everything doped right. You knew my nerves were shot in the war. I refuse to listen to your insane accusations! Tell them to the district attorney. He wouldn't listen, not about you. You've got him in your pocket. Now, minnow was different. He was honest and smart, too. So you had to move fast. Our little hold-up drill put five perfect fingerprints on the gun for you. - This is complete nonsense! - Sit down, sit down! Haven't you enough on your conscience already without attacking a helpless man? You're not so helpless! Look what you can do with your hands. It got me thinking. You could make a lot of things. Such as a contraption that could fire a gun and still leave my fingerprints on it, only mine! Does this look familiar to you? Maybe it's not exactly like the one you killed minnow with, but it works the same. You see the gun inside, the wire attached to the trigger? One little pull, bang! You're wrong, Johnny, you're wrong! - I couldn't kill a man! I couldn't kill a man! - You can, you did, you had to! Because minnow had found out about you and servo. - It was either that or prison. - Johnny, I'm feeling bad, Johnny. I can't catch my breath. Draw the curtains, open the window, Johnny. I want air. This was a smart idea. A little too smart. You can't fire a gun and still have five perfect fingerprints on it. The one on the trigger has to be smudged when you pull the trigger. Unless you use something like this. Don't shoot, Johnny, don't! Two years ago when things got tough for me, I ran. Now, it's your turn. You run. Stop! Did you hear yourself running? Do you know what you sounded like with your cane tapping? Like a dame in high heels! No, Johnny, no! It's not loaded. It never was. Tucker! Tucker! Come in, Tucker! It's alright. His gun isn't loaded. Alright, McBride, you can't get out of this. Put on the lights, Mr. Gardiner. Heho, Logan? Come on over to gardiner's house. Yeah, that's right, gardiner. You can have the whole story, as promised. Yeah, yeah, yeah, exclusive. Oh, and, uh, bring captain Lindsey along. The police might be interested, too. Wait a second. I think he's here now. Thank god you're safe. What about Venus? I just left the hospital. She's gonna be okay. Oh! If anything had happened to either of you it would have been my fault. I had the answer right in my own hands and didn't have sense enough to recognize it. I didn't have sense enough to recognize you... No matter how much you changed yourself. Maybe you can forgive me but I can't forgive myself. I should have known right away that it was the key to gardiner's safe deposit box. In case you'd forgotten, Johnny dear, I was his secretary at the bank. I should have told you when I found the key but I was afraid to give myself away to you. I was longing for you the first moment you walked in. I hadn't seen you for two years, two whole years! I didn't know whether you were living or dead. But one thing I did know, Johnny, that you were innocent. And I knew my only chance to prove it was to get in with servo. When I think of you on that operating table at the hospital... All alone and the pain. And all for me. I loved your face before. Now I have to learn it all over again. I'm gonna love doing that. Because you're still Vera. Let's get married. We don't have to. We were married three summers ago up at the lakes. Beginning to remember that, Johnny? I'm remembering everything. Forgetting nothing.
