Pika! The world of Pokemon, brimming with beauty, variety, and majesty. As the most mysterious and magnificent creatures on this planet, there are over 700 species of Pokemon. And they can be found wherever one looks. Pokemon have many different skills and abilities. And through a phenomenon called evolution, they are able to grow and change. Most people and Pokemon live happy and peaceful lives together as friends and companions. And there are the Pokemon trainers, join forces with Pokemon as battle partners, displaying their skills in competitive arenas everywhere. And because of the strong bond between trainer and Pokemon, a new, powerful phenomenon has arisen. During battle, a trainer's Key Stone can have a particularly synchronistic reaction with the Pokemon's Mega Stone. This results in a temporary but profound increase in the power of a Pokemon. This transformation is known as Mega Evolution. The mystery of Pokemon. Perhaps it is that mystery that exists at the very heart of the world itself. Hmm? I've got it on screen. What do you know? Coming back here to get it, huh? I don't think so. I'm not simply going to hand it over. Alakazam. Glalie. Mega Wave. Kazam. Glalie. Alakazam! Use Freeze-Dry! Glalie! Pika! Great! All set! Pika! Thanks for the help, Ash. Here, Serena, this too. This young man is Ash Ketchum from Pallet Town, who wants to be a Pokemon Master. He and his partner, Pikachu, along with his friends are continuing their training journey. And today, it's time for some Pokemon battle practice. Clemont, don't hold back, OK? Pika-cha. Holding back is not what I do. Pih-pih, Chespin. Hmm. Now, Bunnelby, I need your help. Bunnelby. Let's go, Noivern. Bleh, wah! I stand tall 'cause I know I'm a winner. You've met your match. Yeah, I'm no beginner. No beginner. Gotta catch 'em all! I stand tall 'cause I know I'm a winner. Knock me down, I'll just get up again. You've met your match. Yeah, I'm no beginner. Pokemon, Pokemon. Gotta catch 'em all! You've met your match. Yeah, I'm no beginner. Pokemon, Pokemon. Gotta catch 'em all! I've got all my friends beside me. I'm keeping my eye on the ball. With the wisdom of years to guide me, I'm gonna catch 'em all! No! I'll have to rewash these. - Too bad. Serena, did something just fall? Huh? Ugh. Hey, Pikachu? Pikachu! You OK? What was that? Pikachu. Pika. Wah! Aah! Pika! Oh. Whoa! Look, human. How many times are you going to bump into me? Hey, you can talk. Pika. Is it telepathy? Well? Huh? Wait. What is this? It's stuck! Huh? Amazing! An electromagnetic pulse! I've got no time for this. Stop banging into me. Aah! Knock it off already. I'm not doing anything. It's the EM pulse. An electromagnetic pulse is flowing between those bands. Huh? What's that mean? Basically they're being linked together by an invisible force. Oh, that's just great. Hold on! Cut it out! Are you listening to me? Poor Ash. Slow down! Man, my stomach hurts. Quiet, human. This is none of your concern. Yummy time! Man, that's delish. What are you doing? Because of you, I can't get my balance. Not again! Whoa! It's Twerp Time! Oh, yes. So we finally meet. This way, please. I am the prince of the Azoth Kingdom. My name's Raleigh. Hmm? Magearna, Magearna. Your heart and soul will be the fortress that will protect the people of our kingdom. At least, that is my fervent hope. I'm sorry if you had any trouble getting here. Please forgive me. Huh? Mm, mm. Is that the Pokemon, the one who wants to take you back, Magearna? Magearna? Mega Wave. Huh? Glalie. Alakazam! Gengar. - Mega Evolution? - Why, you! Gengar, psych him. Glalie, Ice Beam. Now, please, don't get worked up. Magearna. Flamel, any other information? Extrapolating from witness reports. What came flying in was a Pokemon. It's called Volcanion. Volcanion? A mythical Pokemon that is said to live in the midst of Nebel Plateau. A mystical Pokemon. Princess, please be careful. I will. Volcanion? That's what you're called? Magearna represents the very future of our kingdom. I want you to understand that. Hey, it takes nerve to freeze it and then ask it to understand. Oh, it's a pleasure to meet you. I am Raleigh, the prince of this kingdom. Prince, huh? So then who might you be? I'm Ash from Pallet Town. I'm a Pokemon Trainer. Well, then, please let me explain. See, Magearna was built by someone using arcane science long ago. Magearna is a Pokemon. A Pokemon? That's correct- a Pokemon! Magearna was created over 500 years ago! It is the only one of its kind in the whole wide world! Huh? Way back then, a great master of arcane science named Nicola lived in our kingdom. He created many wonderful inventions based on the skills of Pokemon, which brought great riches to our land. Magearna was created by Nicola, who presented it to the royal family. Then it is said Magearna lived happily with the princess at that time. But sadly, amidst the chaos of war, Magearna's whereabouts were lost. But today, we have finally found it once again! Mm-hmm! Huh? Pika-pi! Magearna, let's go. Raleigh and Alva too. Could it be? Hmm. Could this be? Whoa! Huh? Clemont, we've got to hurry! Over here! Clement? Serena, Bonnie, this is incredible! This is the Azoth Kingdom! The Azoth Kingdom? It's an ultra-mechanized city. We'll find the great scientist Nicola using arcane science and art. Mechanized? Nicola was a genius. He's truly one of my all-time idols. He used Pokemon skills as inspiration for his many inventions. Truly a great man. Huh? Pikaboo. For you, I would walk through fire and water. Pika-pi! Pikachu! So they call you Volcanion, don't they? Mm, and what do they do? Magearna, you really are a one-of-a-kind Pokemon. Pika. Hahaha. Magearna, everything OK? My name's Ash, And this is my pal Pikachu. Pika, Pikachu. It's nice to meet you too. Don't touch it! Pika. Hey, what are you doing? I can't blast anything without water. You can't? Pika. Don't worry. If those guys show up again, we'll chase them away. I don't from humans. Pikachu. Stay out of this, electric nuisance. Pika. Pika-eh-kachu! Listen up. I'll tell you just one. I will never trust humans. To Pokemon like you that cozy up to humans, I don't trust them either. Pika, Pika. What, Pipsqueak? What to fight? Come on. Everybody just calm down now. Pik. Pika. We found them! Ash! everyone! Huh? I see. You say that you know that young boy trainer. Boy, do we ever. Quite- for a very long time. Too long. You have no idea. And you call yourselves Team Rocket. I'll need more information. More? Sure! Just meeting the mythical Pokemon Volcanion would've been amazing. But to actually meet Nicola's greatest creation of all time? I'm honored! Mm. Huh? It's never coming off. Pika. You humans are useless. That's not nice. I'm sorry. Please forgive me. Huh? Thank you, Magearna. You're a Pokemon treasure. Don't touch it! Huh? Look out! Wah! Pika! Why me? Ugh. Pika. Hi, there! We're back! Huh? Magearna? Amazing! Incredible! Kind of like a Poke Ball. - Pikachu. - Ash? Huh? Tada! Since your clothes are a mess, how about you try these? Hmm. Uh- hmm. Wow, you look great. Really? Pikachu, Magearna, do I? Pika-Pika! Stop it, Magearna. Don't get involved with these humans. I refuse. Leave me alone! Choo! Hey, I told you to quit it, didn't I? OK, fine. I'll doing my best. Aah! Magearna! Are you all right? Magearna, you're soaking wet. We'll get you all dried up. Well, that's a relief. Though you've got to admit, Magearna's heavy. Gearna? Pika? It looks embarrassed. Because it fell? I don't like Magearna likes being called heavy. You're kidding. Of course it doesn't like that. I'm so very sorry. Please forgive me. Clemont means well, but he just doesn't understand some things. We should go. The sun is setting. No. I said, no! I won't bring humans along. Hey, where you going? Come back! Huh? Not again. Pika-pi! Huh? We need to get away right now. Get moving, or I'll leave you behind. Raleigh, wait. Chymia! What is it? I saw you standing up on the tower wall before. And you were with Alva, as well. What were you up to? A scientific investigation. Many of the amazing machines built by Nicola are operating even now. Oh, is that all? Listen to me. If you really want to learn, look to the future, not just to the past. The future? To do that, you need to learn about the past, see? Father is worried about you, as well. Alva was with me, so there was no need to worry. But that's why he's worried. Now, you know that father trusts Alva completely, just like I do. He thinks a lot more about our kingdom's future than you do. So if you'll please excuse me, I have to go. 1, 2- Ta-da! Whoa! Isn't it cute, Volcanion? Huh? Well, that went over well. Maybe it's shy. Could be. Right, Magearna? Getting friendly, aren't they? Sure are. Since we're stuck together now, might as well have fun. - I agree. - Nonsense. I just want to get away from you. Nothing good comes from interacting with humans. Huh? You fell out of the sky with these bands. Remember? Look, humans made these things. Well, it sure wasn't us. All humans are the same. Pika! Hey, you. What are you doing hanging around like that? Get your filthy human hands off me. No, I won't! Cut it out, I said. No, you first! I'll blast you off. Agh. If they're headed somewhere, it's probably Nebel Plateau. Oh, the place with the field of flowers where Magearna was found. Yes. Members of Team Rocket, please go investigate. Count on us, sir! It's all finished! What is? Have a look for yourselves. The future is now, thanks to science. I made this protective suits inspired by moves like iron defense and protect. It's called Mr. Iron Defense. Whoa-ho! You're protected from any kind of attack. Huh? What do I see? It looks like a camp fire. Maybe they're setting up camp here tonight. We have to tell Alva. Wait. Our real boss is the prince. Once we can get our hands on what he wants, we'll be rich. Brilliant! And that's rich. Let's make some dough. Huh? You sensed it, too? Pika. Pikachu! Ah! Huh? Uh, Magearna! Yoo-hoo! Huh? From now on, Magearna's our guest. Team Rocket? What are you guys doing here? Huh? Heracross and Pinsir? Hey, where are your normal Pokemon? We're not your normal Team Rocket. Check this out. Mega Wave Team Rocket! What? Key Stones! We joined forces with the good Prince Raleigh. No way! See? We're Mega Wave Team Rocket! Pika. Mega Wave! Mega Evolve? But how? To Mega Evolve, there must be a close bond between trainer and Pokemon. It's thanks to what Alva calls- er, what was it? Mm. Neo arcane science. With this technology, we can use Mega Evolution and we don't need any stinking bond! I see. So Gengar and the others- Gengar! What about how the Pokemon feel? That's not Mega Evolution! Arcane science was developed to make people and Pokemon happy! You're defaming the memory of Nicola! Hey! We call it neo because technology passed through by science, guys. Now, Heracross! Pinsir, too! Turn them into goo! You, take Magearna away from here. I hate relying on humans, but I have no choice. Go! Everyone, do it. All right. Let's go, Magearna. Leave it to us. Let 'er rip. Pikachu, use Thunderbolt! Pikachu! Get him, Volcanion! I don't need a cheerleader. Yes! Pika. Success! It worked like a charm. Mega Evolution drew Volcanion away. Gardevoir. The nerve! Gardevoir, Mega Evolve! Gard! Gardevoir. Now there's a Mega Gardevoir in my face. Use Dazzling Gleam! Gardevoir! We're blasting off again! Wow! Nothing. Pikachu! Pika. Let 'em have it, Volcanion. Don't blame me for the results. Don't worry. Pika Pika! Science is so amazing. Pika? Huh? So this is your real power. Ha. If I showed you my real power, it wouldn't be just this. I've leveled a whole mountain. Awesome. Pika? Hey, Ash! What exploded? Hey, guys. Pika! Now I've got even more humans. Magearna, I'm Chymia, princess of Azoth. Pleased to meet you. I'm a descendant of the Azoth royal family. Princess? Whoa. Oh, my. They're beautiful. Thank you. Volcanion, you were protecting Magearna, right? Hm. For the kingdom? That's what Raleigh said, huh? Right. One thing's for sure. Raleigh believes everything that Alva tells him- that it's all for the good of the kingdom. Does Raleigh really trust this Alva person that much? Yes. Ever since Raleigh was a boy, he always adored Nicola. Many times, he would spend the entire day in his room, reading old texts and performing experiments. And because of that, when he found out that Councilor Alva was an arcane science researcher, he started to spend more and more time with him. So now, since my brother is involved in this, that means that I am, too. Hey, why don't we just get on board the thing they're riding on? Why would I board something humans built? Oh, come on. Ah! The princess. I know. Dedenne. Wow! A field of flowers! Come to greet us, huh? What? Ah? Ah! Huh? Up ahead. Is that Amaura? Amaura's badly injured. Hold on. Hang in there. We'll take care of it. I don't need your help. I'll carry Amaura myself. Now this big one will fetch me an even better price than that Amaura. A Pokemon hunter. All right, Pikachu, Thunderbolt! Pikachu! I'll fix all of you. What a bad man. Pokemon hunters only want one thing- to make money stealing Pokemon. So bad things like this- do they happen a lot? Yes. But I can usually drive them off by creating mist long before they get this far. Pika. This is Nebel Plateau, our home. So many Pokemon! And they're totally cute! - Drill. - Pika, pika. Pika! Dedenne. Pika? Dedenne. Everybody seems pretty afraid of us. You know why. You're humans, right? It does look like they don't trust us at all. I wonder why that is. All right. I'll treat Amaura. Don't worry. Treat. Don't just do whatever you want. Don't be so angry. You've got to trust us a little bit. You help, too, Bonnie. Sure! Let me help, too. I could help, too. Does it sting? It'll all be over soon. You've just got to be strong. Pika. The bandage is freezing. This sort of thing happens with ice type Pokemon. It's proof of the healing. That means the medicine's working. Amaura, that's so great. Dedenne-ne. Amaura. Forget all the bad times. You're in a safe place now. You have food here. You have friends, too. 'Maura. Sleep now, Amaura. Pika! Pi? Huh? Pika? Pika. It must be that they're scared because we're here. Well, we may be humans, but Pokemon are still Pokemon. All right. Now, everybody out! Pancha-cha. Yeah! Great idea. I'm in. Hawlucha. Talonflame. Bla, bluh. Bun! Bunnelby! Luxray. You see? You don't need to be afraid of us. Help us show them we're friendly. Pikachu! Ch-ch-ch cha-cha-chu. Che. Eee! Chu! Hawlucha. Cha-cha. Lucha. Lucha! Pikachu. Wow, this is great! Yeah! Argh. Huh? Volcanion, are you OK? Hey, wait a minute- the Pokemon hunter. You need help, too. I need nothing. Magearna, stay out of the flower field for a while, OK? But what about you? Hey! Wait for me! Bonnie. It's a hot spring. Like a giant bath. A bath will fix me right up. Wow. Quick, Ash, you've got to get out of there right away. Wha? Whoa! Your suit's absorbing the water. Eugh, and then some. Hm. You humans are an annoying bunch. Wrench, please. Bunnelby. Che. Thanks a lot. Working on gadgets along with Pokemon. I'm sure it must have been like this for Nicola, too. Nicola thought the world needed both humans and Pokemon to be in harmony, which I believe is what inspired him to create Magearna. Magearna's the living embodiment of the philosophy of arcane science. At least, that's the way I prefer to interpret that. It's such a beautiful idea. So you're always here, watching out for everyone. Ha. That's because I never know when I might explode. You've got that right. Pikachu. Why don't you two get some sleep. You're keeping watch, I am, too. Pika, Pikachu. Do as you like. I will. Pika-Pika. Ta-da! Your clothes- they're all clean. Wow. Thanks a lot, Serena. Pikachu! Oh, boy. This won't be easy. Gulpin. Bunnelby. Yes! It worked! Yay! They brought those berries for us. Hm. Incredible. I never thought I'd see humans and Pokemon getting along together here. All these Pokemon- they've been hurt by humans, haven't they? Yes, they have. You, too? Don't worry about what happened to me. All fixed! Good as new. Next time, we're going to be working on you. Working on us? Pika? Watch what this one can do. It's about time. It worked! Thanks so much, Gulpin. Huh? Pika? This Gulpin has its reasons. Anyway, the bands are gone. Leave. Even after all that's happened? After everybody's starting to get along so well? Doesn't mean anything. It does, too. You only did that because we were stuck together. Hey, I really like Pokemon. I want to protect them, too. If you're going to be a Pokemon trainer, then you've got to learn how to make Pokemon feel safe. Right, buddy? - Pika, pika! Spare me your pretty words or I'll blast you. You try it! Pika! Bunnelby. I'm going to sleep. Aw. What? I brought Poke Puffs. Serena and Chymia made them. Pika. Huh? You were surprised back there, weren't you? They just didn't understand. Please forgive them. Sorry, Gulpin. Pikachu. This little one came here after being abandoned by its trainer. Pika. I don't know if anything happened before that. He doesn't tell me, and I don't ask. The only thing I know is that, right before its trainer left, he gave Gulpin a big hug. All of the Pokemon here have been wounded by the selfishness and lies of humans. They may be laughing now, but their wounds are deeply-rooted. And that's the reason I can't trust humans. Pokemon are incapable of lying, but humans are. And do. Pika pika. Pika. Pika pi. Really? This one doesn't lie? Pika! Pikachu! Pikachu. He fights with all he has to protect the ones he loves. Pika pika. Thank you for that. You're right. Pikachu! Both of you are spewing nothing but flowery sentiments. I'm sorry. Before the others get used to you, I want you to leave, though I'm very grateful to you for what you did for Magearna and Amaura. Here. Go ahead and eat. Not bad. If you like it, then why don't you say you like it? Pikachu. Eat. Both of you. Pi? Pika? What is that? Grexit, Talonflame! Luxray, Greninja! Woo! Everyone! Kanu! Dreberon. Jiyoo! Huh? You two. Well, well. If you resist- You're the worst. Bega! They're humans. They think nothing of the lives of Pokemon. Hey! I'll blast you! Manectric, electrotrain! Steelix, use stealth rocket. Mey, nethra. How dare you? If you want to help them, then you should come with us. If you do, then everybody is happy. No! Don't go, Magearna. Then I've no choice. Oh, you'll pay for this! Oh! Magearna! Heeda. So now you understand. Use psychic. Zob. Oog nay. Googi. Magearna! Ah. Rollie, Alva. Everything's OK. All of this is for our kingdom. Oh. Alva, why don't we tell them everything, What an incredible creation Magearna really is? Fine. Gengar, mean look. Gah. Huh? Ah. Gah. Wait a minute. You don't have to remove its soul-heart. That's just as long as Magearna becomes a spear. Nicholas said that- ah! All that I really need is its soul-heart. You can't! If you remove it, then- Alva, what happened? It's gone. Gengar, kindly return Magearna. Chymia, your presence is not required for my plan. Farewell. Use hyperbeam. How could you lie to me? It wasn't for the kingdom! Yes, it was all done for the glory of the Kingdom of Azoth, my ideal one, of course. Gengar, hypnosis. They used dig and safeguard. Thank you, everyone. Re pow. Magearna! Volcanion. Weepa. If it's soul-heart is returned, Magearna should be revived. Everyone on board. Prince Raleigh, I thought that you would understand, that you would be able to comprehend my noblest of dreams. There's no reason to make such a big fuss. We're only talking about one Pokemon. It's Magearna. I can sense it right from here. Oh, Magearna. It's crying. In that case, it's retrieved the soul-heart. Gengar, psychic. Gah! You're even less than useless to me. That field of flowers, that's where I met Magearna for the very first time. Wasn't it 500 years ago? I don't know how you humans measure time. But it's a story from the ancient past. Then, as now, the plateaus. was my home, and that of many, many other troubled Pokemon. Oftentimes, I would check the area for Pokemon that were lost and had collapsed from exhaustion. Magearna was the first one I met that wasn't blown away by my explosions. Magearna liked to take care of others. It seems that even within the kingdom, it was always caring for other Pokemon. i promised I would save Magearna for its sake and for everyone who lives on the plateau. They're still kicking too. Liftoff! What is it, Flamel? Princess, I have something to report. A previously unseen design diagram by Nikola was found in Prince Raleigh's room. Design diagram. Nikola designed a number of gadgets for defending the kingdom, the strongest of them being the wall that presently surrounds it. Part of the wall that defends the Azoth kingdom can separate and turn into a floating fortress. It was designed as protection in times of an emergency. However, an uprising broke out over just who would claim that power. To stop the fighting, Nikola sealed the fortress so that it wasn't able to move, sealed in the darkness of history, along with Magearna. Sealed it? What do you mean, sealed? Huh? 500 years ago, Magearna was not simply the princess's playmate. It had another role, to defend the princess, as well as defend the kingdom. How was it done? Using this. Its power has been sealed off. But by using neo arcane science, it will finally be reawakened. Is that- It's Nikola's floating fortress. And to move the tower, they required the soul-heart. Still here, princess, I see. Very well. After 500 years, I know what my fortress's first prey shall be, the princess. You can do it, Pikachu! Let's get going. - Right! Now fire! I said fire! It's suffering. Magearna is suffering. This power was purposefully created to make all the people of the kingdom happy. But all it did was insight war and hatred. Our citizens are wounded. Magearna, I'm afraid I have no choice but to hide away so that people aren't able to find you. I did my best. I'm sorry. Magearna's still in there. It says it doesn't want to do this. It's suffering! Magearna, so a piece of your heart is still remaining. Torpedo. Megawave! Yeni! Pika! Pika da! Hason! Ya! Ya! Pika! Chun di. Greninja, let's power up! Bon zaa! You're not going to get into mega evolution without real. Ta pi! Pi gone! Pi gone. Help me! Pikachu! Squishy, away! Pika! Yeehee! Oh, Squishy! Go on. They'll take care of this. Let's lead the rest of the Pokemon. OK. Let's get inside quick. Run! Stop! Right under here. OK, stand back. Let's go! Grab on! Yeah! It feels like we're moving. Huh? What? Why, here come the guys. Oh! Aw. Raleigh. Princess Chymia, you're looking well. The Pokemon of Nebel Plateau protected me. So they did. I'm warning you. If you move around too much, they'll tightened up. That's nonsense. Oh, yes. I was going to show you the magnificence of Magearna. Unfortunately, I'm unable to demonstrate its true power in present time. See? Part of its heart still remains. Mean look, if you please. See? It is no longer able to resist. What are you going to do? Please behold the magnificence of Magearna's power. It's struggling. Magearna's resisting with all its got. When either humans or Pokemon lose the things that they truly love, their hearts will break. Firing now! It missed? This is the power, what Nikola feared. That voice, Magearna's voice, I can't hear it anymore. Meowth, what? Magearna, poor Magearna, it's really gone. What did you say? Meowth, I must thank you. It was worth the trouble of keeping you around after all. Its troublesome heart is finally out of the way. It isn't Magearna that I require at all, but merely it's soul-heart. You. You all better prepare yourself. I can't hold back anymore. Soul-heart, this time we will wipe out everything that remains on the plateau. Hey, Squishy! Now what? All right! Ee na! What? What's happened? The Pokemon of Nebel Plateau. They all protected it! It can't be. What can those pathetic little sniveling Pokemon do? Watch your mouth! We're not. We're not! We're not pathetic! Gengar, shadow ball! Quick, Pikachu. Use thunderbolt! - Pizar! Pika! And use electroball! Pika! Gengar! Huh? Gengar. What? I don't think Alva is doing too well. Alva pusom mray. Eh? It looks like they've all woken up. Oh. You're awake. Chymia! Dear Meowth. It's James and Jessie! Volcanion! We got it. Huh? Unfortunately, it seems my plans end here. It's quite obvious it's time to give them up. I'll simply find a new puppet to replace Prince Raleigh. Quick, Greninja, water shuriken. Rup, rup! Ninja! Ah, cut it out. Ash! Everybody OK? And the soul-heart? Magearna, we're here. It's heart is still broken. Sure it can move and all that stuff. But now, Magearna's voice, I can't hear it at all. Oh, no. The fortress is set to fall onto Nebel Plateau. Can it be stopped? It can't it looks like the control system is out. All because of Alva. And even if we were able to escape- Isn't there any way at all? We can't change course. The only way would be to explode the fortress into a pile of dust. Explosions are my specialty. Hold on. You're out of water. Part of the fortress runs on steam so it has water tanks. Volcanion, I'll take you there. Please do. Everybody, wait on my sister's flying machine. I'm going with you. Pika ka. Over here! I can smell water. This thing is really stuck. I've got it. Go for it, Pikachu. Irontail! Pika! Ah, pika! Hey, thanks. It's moving. All right. Yeah! Excuse me. You said your name was Ash, right? That's right. I've been acting like such a fool, spending so long shutting myself up in my lab. That's why Alva had such an easy time tricking me that way. You know what I think? You should head out on your own journey with a Pokemon. Huh? Mm-hmm. Pika te. Volcanion? Say, perhaps I should create an explosion right here. It is the center of the fortress so I do think it would be effective. But then you won't be able to escape. Vita vio. Yeah, that's the truth. You said you're powerful enough to level a mountain, right? So why not follow the plan and blow it up from outside? Hmm. Agreed. We should all go back together. Yeah. Pika! Let's hurry. OK, Volcanion. Go get them! Get on board after the blast. All right. Just go! Volcanion! No! You can't do that! Well, I'm going out with a bang. Time to blast! Magearna, I couldn't protect you. Forgive me. Volcanion. You lied to us. You said we'd all go back together! Heego bego. Magearna? The Nebel Plateau Pokemon are safe. Volcanion protected them. I wish you could hear what I'm saying. Look at the mist. Magearna. Chesnah. Volcanion, hang in there. Volcanion? Oh. Pika. I told you not to do that. You, you're still here? I said I want to protect Pokemon, right? I would never tell a lie. Be davi ya! All of you. You know what? Huh? I'm going to make you all honorary Nebel Plateau Pokemon. Honorary Pokemon. Hey, I think that sounds really cool. Yeah, I want to be one! Yeah, right, Squishy? Mm-hmm. Well, I'm happy to accept. It's a real honor. Hey, electric nuisance. Pika. Your friend, Ash, he always seems to be getting himself into trouble. Pika? Take extra good care of him. Pika, me gatsu. One of a kind, forged of steel from a beautiful night with a mighty heart, drove men apart. Forgotten plain, where only the damaged remain, that's where I found my destiny. One more lost refugee, come with me, feel my soul-heart. If you've been seeking a new start, let me be your guiding light till the end of the night. Close your eyes, know my soul-heart, keeping watch over the rampart. Let me be your shining star, leading voice from afar from whoever you were to whoever you are. Feel my soul-heart now. Dry all your tears. I've returned after so many years Let the creatures I cherish flourish so now. This is my vow. Know forever my soul-heart. Anyone seeking a new start, let me be your guiding light till the end of the night.
