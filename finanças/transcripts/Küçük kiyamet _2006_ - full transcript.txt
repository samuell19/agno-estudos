What are you doing, Mom? We're watching the sunset with your brother, Eda. Where does the sun go, Mom? It goes to brighten another city. Can't it stay? I hate night time. Can't I keep it here with my magic wand? Eda. In another part of the world, another little girl is waiting for the sun to rise. She'd be very upset if you keep it here. They're here! Dad, my aunt is here. I know. -Batu, finish your meal. -OK, Mom. Filiz, why don't you eat? I already did, I'm feeding Alp. Great meal, Filiz. Bon appétit, honey. But your mom made the stuffed veggies. -Thank you, Mom. -Bon appétit, sweetie. You put a lot of grape in it like my mom. -Did you like it? -Yes. Bon appétit. So, how's the house in Fethiye, the one you rented? Is it nice? It looks great in the pictures, but we'll see it once we get there. The pictures must be photoshopped. This will be good for him too, right, Zeki? Yeah, work is very busy these days. But you look well, Zeki. Have you been working out? You're glowing. No, I just quit smoking. -It's been 18 days. -Nineteen. -Sorry. -It'll be 20 in four hours. See, it paid off already. He's healthier, more cheerful and positive. Wow, congrats! But I'm still drinking. Pass me the wine. When did you become a witch, Eda? I'm not a witch, I'm a fairy. And this is my magic wand. What does it do? I do magic with it. Really? Can you turn Didem into a frog? -That'd be great! -Very funny, Batu. Maybe a prince will come and kiss you. Bilge, I hope they won't ruin your vacation. I don't think so, sister. Stop worrying about it. You concentrate on your exhibition. -Don't upset your aunt, OK? -OK. -Have a safe trip, Mom. -Don't stay in the sun too long. OK, Mom. -See you later, Zeki. -See you. -Go back inside. -Bye, Mom. LITTLE APOCALYPSE You changed the exhibition's name? Why? I don't know. All paintings are about death, so I called it "Little Apocalypse." I mean, the moment we encounter death. You didn't used to do such ominous paintings. I don't know, I felt like that. IN MEMORY OF MY MOTHER... I didn't do them to make you cry. I'm sorry. -Call me, OK? -OK, don't worry. -Have a good trip. -See you later. I just have to reason with someone. Yes. Global warming is one of the biggest problems our old planet Earth is facing. -My name is Alice. -Alice. Kids, it's getting late. We have to get up early. Come on, Eda. Have her brush her teeth, Didem. Come on, Batu. I'm against brushing teeth. Toothpaste has fluoride, it's poisonous. -Those theories won't work here. -But it's been proven! Come on, Batu! Model İpek Atacan was spotted out with the businessman Çağlayan Tekil at the newly-opened nightclub. The two were together during the whole opening party. -Will they meet us there? -Yes, they will. -Did you speak with the landlord? -No, the agency is mediating. You didn't speak with him? I approved the payment, they got the money. It's so weird. Renting a house just from pictures. It's what people do now. -When are we going to leave? -We'll leave around 8 or 8:30. Wouldn't that be late? -We'll be ready by then. -We're ready! Where will I sleep, Mom? What do you mean where? In your room, Eda. I want to sleep with Didem. I'm scared to sleep alone. Fine. Mom, you stay here, too. Dad, you stay, too. I'll be driving all day tomorrow. You wouldn't want me to turn into a road hog because I had no sleep. True. Then goodnight, everyone. -Let me take Alp, so you can sleep better. -That'd be great. Goodnight, Batu. Don't forget to brush your teeth! Filiz, make a bed for Eda. Are you sleeping here, too? Where am I going to sleep? VILLA IN FETHIYE Mom. What is it, Eda? I had a bad dream. Tell me about your dream. There was a big monster. I was so scared. There's nothing to be scared of. Look, Didem is here. Batu is here. I'll be here too. In a minute, OK? Don't be scared, go to sleep, dear. Who were you talking to, Zeki? Zeki? Zeki! Zeki! Eda! Mom! -Don't be scared, baby! -Mom! -Batu! Didem! -Mom! -Aunty! -Mother! -Aunty! -Mom! -Aunty! -I'm here! -Aunty! -Mom! Aunty! -Mom! -Please, stop already! Please stop! It's ringing. I was just texting them. Sister? There was an earthquake. But don't worry about us, we're all fine. The kids are fine. We're leaving now. I'll call you when we get there. Love you. Don't worry, okay? I'm giving the phone to Didem. Hello, Mom. We're OK. It was a big one, but we're fine now. Batu is fine, too. Don't worry about us, OK? Are we good to go? -Aunty. -Yes, dear. The earthquake was 41 seconds long. It was reported that the intensity of the earthquake was... The earthquake was... Filiz, give it to Eda. Is everyone OK? Please don't panic and... Are you OK, Batu? We will continue to provide you with detailed information about the earthquake. Wake up, Bilge. We're almost there. Bilge, wake up! What time is it? It's almost noon. Let's pick that girl up. Don't be silly. But we'd be doing good for tourism. -Don't go too far away, Eda. -Where is this landlord? Hello. Welcome. Hello. You managed to arrive here. We heard that the roads were closed. Sorry. I'm Ali, the caretaker of the house. I'm Zeki. -Is there no landlord? -Of course there is. He's on vacation, too. You'll meet soon enough. Come on, let me show you the house. Eda! Kids, come on. This way. This is the living room and this is the kitchen. The TV is over here. The stereo and stuff is here. We have everything. Let me show you upstairs. There are three rooms on this floor. Bedrooms and a bathroom. Yeah. Is there a weird smell here? The houses are made of cedar wood. It smells when it's humid. There's nothing to worry about. It hasn't been aired out for a long time. That's why. This is the pool. I clean it every day with chlorine. And I take care of the garden. I had pest control before you came, but it's impossible to get them all. There are no scorpions or snakes, right? I'd be lying if I said there aren't. But I can say that no one has been hurt. Filiz. Keep an eye on Alp when out, OK? Filiz? This wasn't mentioned on the website. I don't know about that. I'm only a caretaker. A summerhouse with a cemetery view. I've never seen such a thing. That place is harmless. It's a very old cemetery. I clean it up from time to time. No one even visits. I have to go, take this. Call me if you need anything. Here, the keys. See you. Everything is old in here. It's fine, I like the house. Kitchen and bathroom are clean and spacious. We paid a lot for it, it should be. Zeki, stop exaggerating. We haven't been on a vacation for ages. You're right. Look at Eda, she's so happy. She was bored in Istanbul. -Turn into a frog! -A frog? We'll see. Hold the wand properly first. Bilge, give me the glass. Eda, come on, dear. Open your mouth. -Here you go. -Thank you. -The stuffed grape leaves are here, Eda. -What about me? Coke is fine for you. -We have to care for you. -No, thanks. No one knows the formula of Coke. Who knows what's in it besides caffeine and acid. Then there's only water for you, Batu. I want to eat tomatoes. OK, dear. -Mosquitos? -I really hate them. -Let's keep Alp inside, Filiz. -OK. -And make him a mosquito net. -OK. Make one for Didem, too. So her beautiful skin isn't ruined. Wait. To what? What do you think? -To our vacation. -OK, to our vacation. Cheers. Stay away from the pool, Eda. Here you go. I'm sorry. Come, sit here, Filiz. You must be tired. But I made it for Zeki. Zeki is inside. He won't drink it. You have it. Filiz, please sit. I bothered you. No, I was just thinking. My mother. I lost her years ago, but I still can't accept it. -I'm sorry for your loss. -Thanks. How did she die? In the big earthquake. In İzmit. Was she trapped under debris? We searched for days, but we couldn't find her. Is it your mother's? What about the funeral? We had a symbolic ceremony. At my father's funeral... I was very little but I remember it all. Him being buried in a shroud... the dirt thrown on top of him. The whole ceremony. But at my mother's funeral... we just stared at that empty grave. We prayed, knowing she wasn't there. You know, I didn't even shed a tear. But every single day we waited by the wreckage... I cried day and night. I've thought of my mother every single day. But I never went to her grave. I even visit our distant relatives. I go and pray for them. I guess I don't want them to be alone. But your situation is different. Yes, I mean... It seems meaningless, knowing she's not there. Where are they anyway? They're only inside our minds. I don't know. I applied pesticide. All the flies must be gone. Eda? Don't be afraid, baby. I'm not afraid. -Eda, don't move, baby. -Eda? Be quiet, Zeki. Don't move, baby. Mom, look. I'm going to send him home with my magic wand. Eda, please don't do that. Eda, stop it. Eda! Eda! Eda! Were you frightened? No, Mom. My brave little girl. Your sister Didem is with you. And I'm in the room next to you, OK? OK. Goodnight, baby. Goodnight. -Is he sleeping? -He is. Filiz, what are these red spots? Mosquitos. I'll check the mosquito net and sew up any holes. Who were you talking to? -They're calling from work. -At this hour? Our company has a holiday village project here. -They asked me to check it. -And you couldn't say no. How could I? There's a serious crisis in Istanbul. We're on a vacation here but... I can't tell them that I have no time for them. You say no without even thinking when it comes to your family. Aunty? I was taking photos of the cemetery. Photos at this hour, dear? Go straight to bed, come on. -Fine. -Goodnight. Goodnight. Mom! Mom, wake up! Mom! Mom, are you OK? I'm OK, sweetie. I had a bad dream, dear. -What happened? -Mom had a bad dream. Sweetie, go help Didem. -What happened? -It was terrible, Zeki. What did you see? I don't know, it was weird. It was like underground. There was dust everywhere. It was pitch black. I wanted to scream but I couldn't. I couldn't make a sound. Drink this. Bilge. It's perfectly normal. I mean, it was a big earthquake. Pull it together. We're going to the seaside. We're ready! Hello there. Don't "hello" me. What's wrong? There was a dog here last night. We have kids. It nearly bit my daughter, dude. I don't know what to say. The dogs here won't hurt anyone. -And there are so many mosquitos. -Yes. I'm paying a fortune to stay here. What the hell is this now? Don't worry about it. I'll have the pest control come. It'll be fine. Dad, come on! We'll see about that. Where's the seaside? Follow this road. Go straight. The road goes to an isolated bay. The beach and the sea are beautiful. You'll love it. What a hot place. Come out in the sun, Batu. -What? -Sunbathe. You're so white. No. I've got a photo shoot tonight. I need to protect my color. What photo shoot? I'm going to take a photo of myself at the cemetery. Then I'll make it my MSN picture. The girls will love it. I hope you're not wearing the glasses you bought from the market. What's wrong with them? They look cheap and they're bad for your eyes. You know what doctors say. Those doctors are all working for the sunglasses companies. Their goal is to rip off the brand slaves like you. Let's go for a swim, Dad! Your dad's a little busy. And he's already late. Take a quick dip. I should handle this thing. I'll come to pick you up later. OK. Let's go together, Eda. Take your armbands. Excuse me? -Hello. -Hello. I'm looking for this place. Do you know where it is? At the end of the road. Just go straight. Don't turn anywhere. Anyone there can show you the way. Thank you. Why is this place so empty? What did you expect? I don't know, it's summer. The village is great. The beach is great. They will come soon. The season starts late here. But they never leave once they come. Don't just stand here. You want a cup of tea? No, thank you. Come again. Did my little girl learn how to swim? My little girl is swimming! Good for you, Eda. Well done. Let's swim to Didem next, Mom! What if a huge wave comes and takes my baby away? But, Mom, I've got my armbands on. What about diving, dear? I can't open my eyes in the water. It hurts. Let me show you how to open your eyes while under the water. Would you like that? Now, listen to me. We'll take a deep breath on one. We'll hold our noses on two. We'll dive under on three, but keep our eyes open, OK? OK. OK, are you ready? One... Two... Three! What is it, Mom? Let's get out, baby. Excuse me? -I asked you... -Hello. Hello. -I asked you this address. -Do you know where it is? At the end of the road. -But it led here. -Which road did you take? Is there another road? I went this way. You got lost. It's so obvious. Why am I even asking you? Mom, where is Dad? I'm calling him. Double-check the mosquito net, Filiz. They bit his arm too. I hate that they bite him while I'm in the room. I'll check it again. Dad's here! Are we leaving? I want to take a quick dip. What are you talking about? Come on, we're leaving. I'm sweating. I'd like to take a quick dip. -Where have you been? -Don't ask. -I couldn't find the site. -What do you mean? I looked for the address, but I couldn't find it. Have you been smoking? No. -What are these, Zeki? -Mosquito bites. -I called them but they didn't answer. -So you couldn't find a site... in this small village. I looked everywhere. I'm so mad. I was about to go crazy. The villagers couldn't give the directions. So ignorant! There was a waiter at the coffee shop, I asked him and he couldn't give me proper directions. The road leads to the same place. The guys sitting there were weird. They kept smiling at me, weirdos. Goddamn villagers! Bilge? Bilge? -Are you listening to me? -Yes, I am. You said you wandered around. I didn't wander. I got lost. I sunbathed all day, but I still couldn't get the tan I wanted. I can do anything you want me to with my magic wand. Turn her into a black person so she shuts up. -Zeki, stop. -What? -Zeki, stop! -What? Zeki, stop the car! Tell me about it. I saw my mom, Zeki. Your mom died seven years ago. She went missing. No one made it out of that wreck. Half of the building fell into the sea. -I saw my mom. -But she disappeared. These kinds of things are called delusion, mirage or hallucination. She used to come with us on these trips. Maybe that affected you. You're right. -Give me the remote. -Don't touch me, it hurts! Fine, I won't touch you. The authorities issued a warning. Earthquake specialists are inspecting the damaged buildings. Traffic is back to normal. People are leaving Istanbul. Didem, why do earthquakes happen? Come on, explain it to her. The big masses underground change places. -And the earth shakes. -But why? Well, because... Because the souls in hell continue to rise as the living keep on sinning. As the evil people go down, there is no room left in hell. It gets too crowded, they get uneasy and start banging from down there. Bang! Shut up! You can't say such things to a little girl! Come on, sweetie. Let's do some drawings. Don't believe that fool. Idiot! Zeki, I'm in here. I'm in the bath, Zeki! -Didn't you feel it? -What? What can I say? The house is in the wild. It's hard to stop scorpions, you know. Are you kidding me? This is called negligence! Call the landlord! I'll speak to him! -No one can reach him at this hour. -What does that mean? Find him immediately! -You had no problem taking my money! -Zeki. Let it go. Goodnight, Ali. Goodnight, ma'am. No need to drag it out. We're leaving anyway. -What? -What are we waiting for? -Who insisted on coming here? -OK, I did. We came and saw it, that's enough. Look what's happened in two days! I'm having nightmares all the time. A dog nearly bit Eda. -A scorpion... -I have to go to the site. Are you kidding me? -You said you couldn't find it. -Don't you get it? If I don't handle this while I'm here, they'll kill me in Istanbul. They asked me to do something while business is so busy. These things aren't as easy as you think. Yeah, sure. I'm going to bed! It's OK, baby. It's OK, baby. It's all right. You're fine, baby. It's OK. It's OK, dear. I'm making this for you, Mom. The girls will go crazy when I send this with uncle's computer. My grandmother would raise hell if she saw those. -Why? -She was conservative. A true conservative. I used to paint when I was a kid, she'd get angry at my mother. "You're going to make her a pagan, this is polytheism," she'd say. Yes. She'd say that life was a test. She'd always talk about how the things you do in this life affect the next. Eda? Bilge? Hello. -Ali? -It's good to run into you. The landlord asked about you. About me? Yes. Let's sit. After I drink my tea, we'll leave. Thanks, but I've got things to do. When I saw this place empty... Yeah, the people here are weird. Here one day and gone the next. What else is there? There's the sky and the earth. And we're in between. Are you scared? Don't be. Mom, look. Now I'm opening my castle. Stand up. -Bravo! -Well done! Well done! Bilge, what is it? What's going on? I'm so tired, Mom. I wish we waited for Dad. We're almost there. Everyone, pack your stuff up. We'll leave once Zeki gets here. -Stop messing around, Batu. -OK, I'm coming. Where is Batu? What is this? Aunty? Who could've done this? Bilge, Alp has a fever. Let me see. He's burning up. -Should we take him to a doctor? -In this rain, Filiz? Zeki and the car are gone. Mom, is my brother sick? He's got a fever, dear. He'll be better soon. Dad will take him to the doctor when he gets here, right? Right. Come on, what are we waiting for? Let's leave. Let's go, hitch a ride. Enough, Batu. Where are we going without Zeki? Are you stupid? Didn't you see? Our graves have been dug outside! -Let's go before we die. -Shut it! -You're scaring the kid. -I don't care! I don't even have cell service! -Where did you bring me? -Batu, enough! Fuck! -Hold on, kids. -What's this? -Aunty! -Don't move. Everyone stay still. Stop yelling, Eda! Where are you, Eda? Come over here. Eda! Aunty! There's someone at the cemetery. Let me see. Hold this, Batu. Guys. Everyone will listen to Filiz. You got it, Eda? You too, Batu. Filiz, I'll be right back. Zeki! Zeki! Zeki! Zeki! Zeki! Zeki! -Calm down. -Zeki! It's too late now. -Zeki! -His time came, you can do nothing. Hold on, Zeki! Leave the man alone. Ma'am! Hold on, Zeki! Hold on! Hold on! Ma'am, let him... Don't be afraid. Ma'am! Zeki, please don't leave me! Zeki, please don't leave me! Zeki! Zeki, please don't leave me! Zeki, hold on! Hold on, Zeki! Zeki, hold on! Bilge. Mom! Mom! There's nothing you can do for him. Mom, please help me! Help me! Help! But you can save the children. Only you can do it. Filiz? Filiz, where are you? Eda! Didem, Batu, where are you? -We're here. -Here! We're here! Where were you, Mom? I'm here now, sweetie. -Where's my dad? -He'll be here later. -How is he? -The same. You'll be OK, dear. Kids, we're going downstairs. Eda, we're going downstairs, dear. Come on, Batu. He's crazy, he's going to kill us! Who is he? What does he want? I want my dad! Kids! Run upstairs! Batu, upstairs! Eda, I'll be right back, baby. Promise me that you won't let go of Didem's hand, OK? Stay away from me! Stay away! Don't resist it, it's in vain. What do you want from us? This is my job. I take people when their time comes. Don't be afraid. The time has come. First, you... then the children. But first, you. Let's not keep the landlord waiting. There's the sky and the earth. And we're in between. Where are they anyway? They're only inside our minds. Aunty! Aunty! Aunty! Aunty! Mom! Filiz. Filiz. Batu! Zeki! Eda! Eda? Aunty? Batu! -Where are you, Batu? -I'm stuck here. Batu? Batu, do you see Eda? Is she all right? -Is she all right? -No. Eda? Baby? Eda? Eda! Eda! My baby! Eda! My baby! Eda, my dear? Eda, are you all right? Are you OK, Eda? Eda, are you OK? Eda? Are you OK? -Wait for me. I'll be right back, baby. -Don't go! I'm going to get your brother. -Don't go! -I'll be right back, baby. Stay right here. I'll be back. Didem? Didem? Is my sister OK? -Aunty? -Batu. I'm here. Didem! She's alive! She's alive! Filiz? Filiz! Alp! Alp, come here, baby. Come here, dear. Come here. Your mom is here, Alp! We're going to make it, Filiz. Filiz, we all are! We're all going to make it. Don't leave Alp alone. Don't leave him. We're going to get out of here. We all are! Help! Help us! We are here! We're up here! Up here! We are here! Please line up. Hold her hands together! -Come on! -His left foot is broken. Wait back there. Open your eyes. Open your eyes. Slowly! Slow down! Don't move his feet! Slow down! Slow down! -Stay low! -Stay low! Come on! Slow down! Her foot is broken, bring her here. Hold her feet! Clear the way! We're up here! We're up here! Up here! Move. Nurse! Calm down. Establish vascular access. It's OK. Don't move. -My kids. -I'll be right back. Filiz! Mom! Zeki. Batu and Didem are OK. They called their mom, don't worry. Eda? Mom and Dad love you very much. They love you both. OK. I love you very... Doctor, over here! Thready pulse. Can't get her blood pressure. Let me do my job here, please. Pupils are dilated. She probably has internal bleeding. Nurse, get her an IV. OK. -Is atropine ready? -Yes. She can't breathe. We need to intubate. I'm bringing it. Subtitle translation by Yeşim Hısım Arpağ
