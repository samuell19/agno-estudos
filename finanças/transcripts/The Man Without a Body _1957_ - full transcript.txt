Look, Mr. Brussard, this contract... Mr. Brussard... Goodbye. Oh, good morning, darling. I was talking to my hairdresser! Get me a transcript of Mademoiselle Odette's account. See where my money went. Yes, sir. "Yes, sir." You have a degree from Oxford, and yet you have a vocabulary of only two words. Yes, sir. No, sir. Okay, Bill. What about the stock for your oil securities, sir? My order still stands. Sell. But you were buying, sir. Huh? Oh, yes, that's right. Buy. Next. Uh, the ships lying idle in Miami, sir? What ships? They're your ships, sir. What are you talking about? The Transee shipping fleet, sir. Ahem. You acquired them together with that, uh... Something the matter, sir? No, nothing's the matter. Everything's all right. But these-- Why don't you answer the phone? Answer it! But, sir, the phone isn't ringing. Hello. Hello. Hello. Monsieur, Mademoiselle, she has a razor. She is going to cut her wrists. Let her. But, Monsieur... Get out. All right, that will be all for you. Yes, sir. I want a massage. Suzanne, did you tell him? Oui, mademoiselle. And what did he say? He said, "Let her." Oh! Ah, good morning, doctor. You're early. Good morning, Mr. Leslie. How have things been this past week? Well, he's his usual self. Oh, that bad? Mr. Brussard had difficulty in remembering vital business matters. Mm-hmm. A moment ago, he heard telephones ringing. More delusions and loss of memory. Good morning, Karl. How are you? Huh? What? What is this? Do I know this man? Sir, your doctor. Dr. Charot. Don't you recognize him? I want to talk to you, Karl. What I have to say is personal. Okay, Bill. That will be all, Mr. Leslie. I want to talk to you about your X-rays, Karl. Ah, ha-ha. Money can buy anything. I have a headache, and you bring a man from Paris to take pictures of it. Heh-heh. Ah, beautiful. The brain of Karl Brussard. This is a serious matter, Karl. I built an empire out of nothing, and this is the brain that did it. I shined shoes, and now bankers will fight to lick my boots. Karl, this is where the headaches come from, this dark area here-- Tell your specialist the headaches are gone. Karl, you've always insisted upon frankness. Always. Then please let me speak frankly now. I have a complete report from the hospital. Which you can give to my secretary. Karl, their findings are serious. And expensive. You're trying to tell me again I'm a very sick man. Yes. Yes, but I have muscles of steel. Yes, yes, a living Rodin. Double vision, Karl. I asked you to rest more. You wouldn't follow my advice. Karl, you have a brain tumor. I don't want to say it, but... Say it. Now, Karl, it's difficult for me. You're trying to tell me I haven't long to live. Karl, well, if you must know, yours is the type of brain tumor that can hardly be successfully operated on. Karl, I'd like to have you checked again. In a recent medical journal, I read about a young brain surgeon doing experimental work on brain transplantation. His name's Merritt, an American. The man's somewhere in Europe. London, I think. Well, don't think. Find him. You will wait here. Yes? Karl Brussard, from New York. Dr. Merritt is expecting me. Oh, I don't know if the doctor can see you right now. Ah, Dr. Merritt, this is Mr. Brussard. Oh, yes. How are you, Mr. Brussard? How do you do? Thank you, Jean. I've been expecting you. Will you excuse me a moment? I'll get your file. Here we are. Will you step in here, please? Thank you. Right in here, Mr. Brussard. You can put your coat there. I, uh... I have the report and a letter from your Dr. Charot. He asked that I be very frank with you. Of course. Yes. Won't you sit down, please? Thank you. Mr. Brussard, I have read your X-rays. I'm sorry to say, but I must agree with the diagnosis. Surely a doctor of your standing can do something to help me. I can see you're extremely energetic, high-strung. Your personal physician advised a complete rest. Isn't that so? Yes, but... And you didn't do it. Doctor, I don't want to sit and wait to die. I want to be cured. Hallucinations, double vision, and the reflexes. Mr. Brussard, I'd like to make a test of my own, a chart of your brain waves. Why, yes. Thank you, doctor. Would you follow me? Yes, yes, yes. Oh, Mr. Brussard, you've already met Miss Jean Kramer. And this is Dr. Lew Waldenhaus. How do you do? Will you excuse me for a moment, please? I want to make a chart of his brain waves. Yes. Would you come this way, please, sir? I'd like to put you under the encephalograph. One moment. Doctor, that monkey's head. Is it alive? Oh, yes, of course. It's kept alive by that artificial heart and lungs. Jean. This way, sir. Will you please sit on this seat? Thank you. Just relax, Mr. Brussard. Light? What an intelligent, masculine hand for a chauffeur. It won't work, honey. Think of something better next time. Heh. Scalpel, Lew. Scalpel. Yes, sir. Reading 5-2-0. 5-2-0. Hold this, will you? Reading? 5-9-0. All right, now tie it-- tie it off. The pulse is going down very rapidly, doctor. Jean, I almost forgot Mr. Brussard. Will you bring him into my office, please? Right, doctor. Lew, keep a close watch on the monkey. Sure, doctor. May I say it was a privilege to assist you? Thank you. Would you follow me to the doctor's office, please? Here's the graph, doctor. Oh, thank you, Jean. Anything else, doctor? No, that'll be all, thanks. Now let's have a look at it. You're losing your sense of feeling. It's my nerves. What do you expect? Keeping me waiting like this. What did you find? I'm sorry to tell you this, but the graph only confirms what we already know. Oh, but, doctor, surely you can do something for me. Some day perhaps. Mr. Brussard, you saw the monkey's head in there alive? Yes. It had been dead six years. We restored the head to life. You restored a dead monkey's head after six years? Yes. Revitalized the tissues, made the brain within function again. That brain was just transplanted into the skull of the circus monkey you saw in the crib. Its own brain had suffered a concussion. You are a veterinarian? Ha-ha. No, no. That's the way it works-- in steps. You see, medicine progresses in steps, from the lower animals to man. So, all you would need for me would be a brain, a human brain? Well, it's hardly that simple. Well, buy one, steal one. I'll do anything. Think, Mr. Brussard. You would be willing to commit murder? I tell you, doctor, I'll do anything. Yes, come in. Yes, Lew? Excuse me, doctor. We've just taken the first readings. Pulse, respiration, temperature, almost normal. As soon as I've finished with Mr. Brussard, we'll drop out and have a bite to eat. No, doctor. I must have a proper talk with you. All right. You'd better run along, Lew. I'll be back by the time the anesthetic wears off. Thank you, doctor. Shall we go? Yes, yes, yes. Where is Mademoiselle? She went for a walk. We'll pick her up later. Karl! Karl! Karl! Can I take you anywhere, young lady? I'd like to catch up with that car. Oh, hurry up. You'll lose him. Car won't start. Oh. You did this on purpose. Well, maybe I did. Anyway, why would a girl like you want to follow anybody? Is that a compliment? Uh-huh. What's your name? I'm Lew. I'm Odette. Hi, Odette. Uh, I'm just going out to lunch--a quick lunch-- but how about joining me? Mm. I'm starved. Good. Lew. Oh, Dr. Merritt, I'd like you to meet Miss Odette, um... Vernay. How do you do? This is Mr.-- Yes, I'm already acquainted with Mademoiselle Vernay. Oh. Well, we'll-- We'll see you two later. How's this one? Fine. The man I told you about. Oh, yes, he's been consulting with Dr. Merritt about himself. Seemed pretty nice. But terribly strict and possessive. He was my father's business partner. Since papa died, Monsieur Brussard insists on finding me a husband. Without success, I hope. Completely. I know too well what I want in a man. Doctor, what I saw continues to amaze me. This living monkey head came from an animal kept in... Kept in a crypt. It was well-preserved. You see, burial in the ground disintegrates animal tissues. And it had been dead for some time? Six years. We found that tissues can be made to function if properly preserved, even after centuries. You keep emphasizing "well-preserved." A very important point. You see the embalming process would have to be... Yes? Heh-heh. Mr. Brussard, we're getting into a very complex subject. Complex, yes, but very interesting. So, you are a doctor? Well, I have a degree, but someday I hope to be surgeon. You have the hands of a surgeon, so strong. I'll bet it would take a very successful surgeon to buy you trinkets like these. There are other things important to a woman. I'd, uh, like to see you again. I would too. But it would be very difficult. Why? Look, give me your phone number. That's impossible. He won't permit it. Do I have to ask him too? Yes, doctor, I get the point. You were trying to save the life of a sick animal. Yes. At first it looked as though it may be a hopeless case. But this new brain, won't it cause the animal to act differently? Of course. Each brain has its own characteristics. The one I used came out of an ordinary household pet with limited intelligence. Now, transplanted into the healthy body of an extremely alert and well-trained circus animal, it could very easily be taught amazing tricks. And all this could apply to a human with a strong body? Mr. Brussard, a human is also an animal. Yes, it makes sense. But you would need an intelligent brain, a brilliant brain. And it could be made to change its way of thinking, its personality. This tiny lady is Madame Tussaud, the founder of this, the greatest waxwork show on earth. This lady modeled the famous and the infamous of her time. Opposite her is the famous Sleeping Beauty, who has been breathing like this since 1793. She was modeled from a well-known beauty of the court of King Louis XVI and preferred to be guillotined rather than submit to the embraces of Robespierre. And now if you'll walk this way with me... Here we have that much married monarch Henry VIII and his six wives-- Catherine of Aragon, Anne Boleyn, Jane Seymour, Anne of Cleves, Catherine Howard, Catherine Parr. Two he beheaded. Two he divorced. One died in childbirth. Here we have the greatest criminals of modern times-- Hitler, Goering, Goebbels, Ribbentrop. This is Guiteau, who assassinated President Garfield of the United States in 1882. This is the man in the iron cage, John Calas, who was accused, sentenced, and put to the torture in 1762 for the murder of his son. Robespierre, whose death by guillotine marked the end of the Reign of Terror in France. Here we have Marie Antoinette, modeled from the actual death mask by Madame Tussaud. And this, ladies and gentlemen, depicts the execution of Mary, Queen of Scots, which took place, not as many people think, in the Tower of London... And now, ladies and gentlemen, we come to the Sphinx of France, the oracle, the prophet, the physician, the mathematician, the astronomer. Nostradamus, who, in the 16th century, foresaw the massacre of St. Bartholomew's Day. He foretold the French Revolution, the Fire of London, and the rise of Napoleon. A great mystic. A great intellect. Graced with the rare gift of prophecy. He wrote about the war in the air and the coming of the atomic age. And now, ladies and gentlemen, if you'll step this way, we-- Wait. Where is he buried, this Nostradamus? In France, I think. If you'd like any further information about this interesting character, sir... Oh, good evening, sir. What'll it be? Later. Now, uh, I want to see Dr. Brandon. Dr. Brandon? I hate to say it, sir, but he's a-- I think you'll find him over there at the end of the bar. What were you about to say? Well, it's a long time since he was a doctor, sir. He got into a bit of trouble. Hmm. Dr. Brandon? My name is Karl Brussard. I've heard of you. What are your plans? We are going abroad. We're going to France. Here is the first installment for your trouble. You will need new clothes. It is a very special service I wish you to perform for me. We are leaving immediately. France, huh? Ah, yes, this is it. Quick, take your coats off, get moving. Okay. Here's your money. Now get going, Brandon. Dr. Brandon. Quack Brandon, you mean. You never were a doctor. Now go on. Go and buy yourself a distillery. Ah, darling, you look lovely. I'm taking you back to London right away. Is this all your baggage, sir? Yes. Yes. Those three pieces. Here are the keys. Have you anything to declare? No, nothing, nothing. That belongs to you, sir? Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot. May I see it, please? I can unwrap it. It's a present for Mademoiselle. A very good likeness of your daughter, sir. Oh, thank you. Porter. Porter! Where did you get this? That's not important. Grave robbing is a crime. Not for some people. Whoever severed this head did a very professional job. The spinal cord-- why, even the larynx is intact. Whom did you pay to do this? A very professional secret. Mr. Brussard, who is this? Someone unknown. Unknown, unmourned. Jean, did you send the reports to the medical institute? Yes, doctor. I did. Good. Twenty-two days. How much longer? I don't know. The monkey responded in seven. Aw, failure, failure. Look, if you don't mind, I'll be the one who tells you whether this is a failure or a success. If you insist upon sticking around here, you'd better find yourself a corner and sit there. This is a scientific laboratory, and we don't work on a timetable. I'm sorry. I'm very tired. I guess we could all use some sleep. That beautiful word. Come on, Jean. I'll drive you home. How about you, Mr. Brussard? No, no. My car is waiting. Good night, Lew. See you later, Lew. Good night. Something wrong? Not a thing, doctor. What's with this "doctor" routine? Can't you ever leave the laboratory behind? Even for a evening? And it's such a lovely evening. I'm sorry, Jean. I'm not exactly unattractive, you know. I suppose the word is beautiful. I've seen you show more emotion over an X-ray of someone's medulla oblongata. Doctor, what's the color of my eyes? Uh... What color? Blue? Green. Mr. Brussard's suite, please. Odette? Hello, darling. Yes, he just left. I told you I had to stay tonight. Look, Jean, I don't know what I'd do without you. At the lab. I'll be there as usual at eight. May I give you a word of advice? Don't ever marry a doctor. Thanks. I don't intend to. Have a good night's sleep, Lew? Good morning, doctor. Well, I... All right. Good morning, doctor. Morning, Jean. Morning, Lew. Morning. Our friend here's been up all night. Yes, he's been keeping late hours lately. Oh? Look! It must have just happened. Jean, the activator. It's steady. Good. Lew, gloves. I only hope we're not too late. Watch the activator, Jean. Lew, steady on the oxygen. More. Okay. Jean, decrease the charge. Its breathing is stronger. Careful now. Hypo, Lew. Come in. Lew, see who it is, will you? Something's happened to the boss on the way here. He fainted. Look, take him upstairs. It's the first door on the left. Put him into bed, huh? How is his pulse? Fast. I'll be up in a minute. That's about all I can do for now. Keep the flow constant. Right. There we are. I'll go up and see how he is. Call me if anything happens. I will. Well? Looks like a slight stroke. What did you give him? This. That's good. The shot ought to last at least eight hours. What happens after that? Let's wait and find out. How is he? He's a very sick man. Oh, listen, before I forget. Let's not mention a word about how we're progressing with this. Huh. From the way Brussard has been following every step we take-- Well, let's face it. He didn't bring this here in the interests of pure science. But it's his only chance. It's obvious he's only thinking about when that brain will be alive again. Then he'll--he'll appraise its thinking power, its intelligence and personality. He'll try to make it Brussard. Then he'll insist. Hello. Yes, certainly. Lew, a female with an accent. Oh, thank you. Hello. Yes. How are you? Yes, I think so. About 7:00? Doctor, you said you were going to try shock treatments tonight. Are you sure you won't need me? I don't think so. Anyway, it's your night off. Why, Lew! You look positively dashing. Thanks. Who's that? Heavy date? Yeah. Yes? Monsieur Karl Brussard, he's here? Yes. You'd better come in. He's very sick, isn't he? Maybe you'd better talk to Dr. Merritt. Oh, monsieur doctor, you remember me? Yes, Miss Vernay. Please, tell me about Karl. He's resting upstairs. It's serious? Yes, it's quite serious. Oh, please, I--I must see him. Take me to him. I'm afraid it wouldn't do any good. Oh! Of course, I-- I know I'm acting foolish. But it's just that... Miss Vernay, when he awakens I'll tell him you were here. Thank you, doctor. I brought a few things-- his pajamas, toothbrush, a robe. I'll take it up to him. Thank you. You're very, very kind. Not at all. I'm going now. No? Oh, my taxi-- I sent him away. I can call you another. If Mademoiselle doesn't mind, I'm driving toward the West End. Thank you. Not at all. Good night, Jean, doctor. Good night, Lew. Good night, Lew. Doctor, you will call me when he is better? I'll call you, Miss Vernay. Good night. Good night. Good night. That accent. Hmm. What? Never mind. What was your last reading, Jean? Shock at 6-0-5. Increase the charge 10 points. That's good. Now keep increasing slowly. Hold it. We don't know how much it can take. I can understand after what you've told me. What, mon chéri? About you and me, the dark corners, meeting in secret. And all because of Brussard. A young girl like you. Yes, he wants me completely for himself. I can see why. Heh-heh. You are gallant. It, uh, doesn't worry you? Why should it? He can be dangerous. So can I. You are joking, mon chéri. Heh-heh. Maybe. But why should we waste time talking about him? Uh, keep the voltage steady. All right, lower the charge way down. That's enough for now. We'll try again later. Do you have the report for the medical association? I have it started. It's in your office. You want to have a look at it? Yeah. Mmm. Dr. Merritt-- He will make Karl well again, no? Well, my guess would be yes, but providing he undertakes it. Then if Karl is cured, for us everything ends. Why? You've got your life to lead. Oh, you don't understand. Karl frightens me. I wish... Oh, I wish... Can't you see there is something you can do not to make Karl well again? Look, I'm a doctor. Remember that. And if there was anything I could do, it would only be to help Dr. Merritt. If Karl gets well, we are through. And I see you prefer it that way, because you are a doctor. I forgot! Oh, you... It's alive. My brain. It's alive! My brain. They tried to take you from me, tried to trick me. To them you're just an experiment. To me you mean life. It's alive. You wouldn't tell me. Brussard-- You tried to steal it from me. Look, you're a sick man. No. You tried to kill me, tried to drug me. Jean, get a sedative! No, no. I'll destroy it. You won't get it! Oh, Phil, I've got the omnigeiser working. All it took was a fuse. Good girl. Well, I got him to bed, and I locked the door. Good. Michel... Phil... Phil, look at it. Can you hear me? Michel... What did it say? Michel de Notre Dame. Michel de Notre Dame. Tell me again, what is your name? Michel de Notre Dame. Michel...? Jean, it's Nostradamus! It can't be. The prophet. The astrologer. The physician. And your mind is alive again. I remember... I remember... Yes, yes. Go on. Tell me. When were you born? One thousand five hundred and three. Provence. St. Remy. Michel, listen to me carefully. This is the 20th century. Do you understand? The 20th century. I have always lived in the future. You predicted you would return, and you have after 400 years. They called me a charlatan, an imposter. Only the ignorant. There were others who said you had a special sense to forecast. Have they burned my books? No, no. You are still read and still honored. Many of the things you predicted have come true. The French Revolution, the rise and fall of Napoleon, dictatorships come and gone. You have caught sunlight in a globe? That's an electric light. We've a whole new world to show you. Who are you? A doctor. A physician like yourself. We shall have much... to talk about. Brussard was a madman to bring us the brain of Nostradamus. He wants it for himself. Phil, do you realize what we've done? Resurrected the greatest mind of his time. It's frightening. So you see, electricity has enabled us to send voices-- even pictures-- through the air. I understand. But all of these things you predicted in your writings. You even foresaw armies fighting in the air. Yes. We call them airplanes, mechanical flight. There is also the submarine. As you wrote. "The sunken fleet shall swim." The plagues of your time are gone. We've destroyed them with drugs. Living molds from the soil. The sun. Yes. I guess the sun, the moon, and the stars are about the only things that haven't changed. Brussard. You can't keep him locked up in his room all day. I can try. I'll be right back. We have created artificial hearts, kidneys, lungs. We have even regenerated dead tissue. How? So you locked me in, eh? What am I, a prisoner, an animal? Mr. Brussard, for your own good I'm ordering you to calm down. Remember, you're my patient. That head downstairs, we know who it is. Ah, it can hear? It can speak? It told you, eh? Yes. It can hear and speak. It's Nostradamus. How did you get it? Yes. Yes. It's Nostradamus. A great mind that can see into the future. Worthy to be Karl Brussard! I would like to see it. Remember, I am a dying man. I promise I'll be calm. All right. If you can. Plasma pumped through these tubes mixes with oxygen, and the fluid returns for replenishment. This way your tissues receive food. Yes. So you see, these manmade devices keep you alive. It is against nature. Why have you done this? You want the brain of Nostradamus. Not Nostradamus. You're Karl Brussard, the master. Your name is Karl Brussard. I am Nostradamus. Brussard, remember. I'm sorry. Jean, Lew. I thought it best to leave him alone. Lew? No, thanks. Thank you, Jean. Did you notice that look of cold determination on Brussard's face? Yes. A complete egomaniac. You know, even his delusions follow the usual pattern. He is desperate. Let's not forget that. Try to imagine you are Karl Brussard. Your father was a drunken cobbler. - You hated him. - No! Assume it is so. At the age of 11, you ran away from home. You shined shoes, cleaned sewers, did anything for money. You watched for opportunities. You are smart, alert. Today you control a financial empire. Men hate you. You trust no one. Soon you will be the most powerful man in the world. Do you think that Brussard will succeed in dominating Nostradamus? It depends. See, in a way it's like a hypnotic seance. Some people are susceptible, others are not. We know Brussard is a forceful person when in his right mind. Nostradamus is an unknown quantity to us. Quite. So you understand? I am buying all these oil properties in order to gain control. I will never sell until it is accomplished. Tell me, will you remember? You will have to carry on for me. Tell me, will you remember Karl Brussard? I am Nostradamus. I order you to answer. I, Karl Brussard-- All right, stop this. You're overtired, Mr. Brussard. Enough for now. Yes, you're right. I need rest. Please, may I use the phone for my hotel? Right over there. Mr. Brussard here. Give me my suite. What? Try them again. No. No message. Darling, you're back. I've been so lonesome. Yes, I had a few drinks, all by myself. What else can I do? I have seen every cinema, visited every museum. My poor, sick darling. Odette has worried about you so much. I brought your things. Did they tell you? But the doctor wouldn't let me see you. Come in. Cablegram for you, sir. Thank you. What is it, darling? Karl! Karl, where are you going? I've come to you for assistance. I've just had an urgent message. An important decision has to be made. But I'm very tired, my mind is confused. You have a good memory. Repeat what I told you about the oil properties. Please, my whole fortune is at stake. All my life's work. Millions of dollars. Yes. Listen. Here is a list of all my holdings. Well, now you know. What shall I do? You want to gain control. But I say sell. You're right. I'll take your advice. We will sell now at a high price. Another coup for Karl Brussard. You are very shrewd, my friend. You will be able to carry on for me well. Operator, I want to send a radiogram. Brussard Enterprises, New York. Attention: Mr. Leslie. Come at once. Signed Karl Brussard. Thank you. Stop. You want to destroy Brussard, not me. I know the purpose I serve. Think. He can get another brain. There is one way to destroy Brussard, and I am doing it. You think fast, Nostradamus, but I won't change my mind. I said... I am destroying Brussard. Quote on oil land stocks for Mr. Brussard, please. Down five points, sir. Hmm. This is New York, sir. The price is dropping. Your orders, sir? Yeah, this is Karl Brussard himself speaking, yes. Sell, sell! Understand? Sell! Yes, but Mr. Brussard insists on selling. How many shares? Fifty thousand. Fifty thousand. Here, Mr. Brussard. What is this? Give it to my secretary. What is it? Your assignment of additional securities to the banks. You have been selling shares already pledged. You require additional security from Karl Brussard? Do you doubt my solvency? Those are my instructions, sir. This is in order, sir. Thank you. You understand, sir, this pledges all your assets to the bank? Oh, are you questioning my judgment now? Get out! Mr. Brussard's suite. Well, how is it? I'm afraid there are practically-- practically no bids for your stock, sir. Look, if I might suggest, sir, do you think we might reverse the process and buy? No, no! I know what I'm doing. I'll ring you back. Wait. Don't answer it. Don't answer any of them. Wait. Yes? I don't understand. He's in the next room. Who? New York? I'll try. Please hold on. Excuse me, darling, New York is calling you. They say it is very important. Hello. I understand you have a call for me from New York. Brussard. Yes. This is Karl Brussard. Yes. You won't go along with me? No? Right. Right. Sir, if there's anything I can do... It's no use. It's all over. I'm ruined. Where is he? For the first time in my life I depended on someone else, on you. You tricked me. You ruined me. It's not I who lost. Aw, you--you made a pauper out of me! Really, Mr. Brussard, you must control yourself. Brussard, I order you to get out of here. Yes, and give me these keys you took from my room. Now get out of here. Your hotel, sir. Follow that cab. Wait a moment. Pull up there. So, you're walking out on me, eh? But you didn't get very far. Let me explain. You're right. There's not much left of Karl Brussard. All I have left is you and your jewels. No, Karl. Jewels and Odette. They go well together. They're mine. I'm not going to take them from you. I want to put them on you. To see you in all the loveliness I could once afford. I will put them on you piece by piece. And you... will smile for me. Yes. Look, remember? I gave you this in Sun Valley. Now, come, put on the smile you put on when I gave you this in Sun Valley. What are you trying to do? Smile, smile. No, Karl, no, no! Smile... Why, darling, what a pleasant surprise. So it's you she's been carrying on with, eh? Oh, Phil! Phil... Who was it? Brussard. The cranial nerves have been severed. Help me get him in there. That's about all we can do. I'm afraid there's not much hope. It's funny. Brussard wanted this brain. Now we may have to use it to save Lew. If only we could. Jean, you'd better call the police. Yes. Yes. Yes, inspector. Mr. Brussard is armed. It won't be difficult to locate him. We have his description. Sorry to keep you waiting, officer. His condition, doctor? Very bad. No hope. Surgery? I don't think so. The damage was too extensive. You'll keep us informed? Certainly. Thank you, doctor. Miss. Thank you. The circulator. The connections are damaged. Whoever it was has gone. The main circuit is broken. It'll die, Phil. We can't lose it. This is more than an experiment. Jean, check the omnigeiser. This plaster cast fits fine. Give me a hand there, will you? Yes. Careful. I want to strap it down here. There. That's good. Now we have to feed it intravenously. We appreciate your cooperation, doctor. You've given me enough information for a full report. Good. Excuse me, sergeant. There's a telephone call for you. Thank you. Excuse me, gentlemen. In here, please. Certainly. Dr. Alexander, you're the county medical officer, so I would like to ask you a professional question. Yes? Would you have done what I did? Under the circumstances, yes. We must abide by the Hippocratic oath to preserve life whenever possible. I only hope that your theory is a success. If it is, I intend to bring it before the medical institute for further study. Yes. Ah. First clue of Brussard in three days. The local barber called headquarters. This afternoon he shaved a man of Brussard's description. We'll check, of course. Could be. Well, thank you again, Dr. Merritt. Certainly. Goodbye, Dr. Merritt. Goodbye, gentlemen. Goodbye. Bye. I must be getting nervous. I thought I heard something. Now, let's have a look at it. No! No! No! No! No! No! Keep away! No! Keep away! Connect the feeding tubes. No. No! Don't! Jean, are you all right? Oh, darling... I'm so scared. Those terribly cold hands. Where is it? I don't know. Dr. Alexander. Oh, hello, Dr. Merritt. I understand you've had trouble. Hmm, I see. Well, it can't move very quickly. Nourishment? I fed it intravenously. I'm glad you agree. That's right. You know it's remarkable that it's alive, this head mounted on your assistant's body. That was quick thinking on your part, doctor, I must admit. The question is how long it can live. It-- It seemed demented, maybe because of the shock of energy. It's lost its power of speech. Yeah, that's right. Thanks very much, doctor. Goodbye. Yes. Oh, yes, inspector. I knew it couldn't go too far. Well, that's right near here. Police dogs? I-- Inspector, I wonder if you'd try and control them. I don't want it hurt. Fine, thanks very much. Goodbye. It's been seen close by. Let's go. That's him! There he goes. In the schoolhouse. There he goes. The dogs must have chased him in here. I'll go and get him. Right. Officer, please. Don't go up there, sir. Yes, please. Brussard! Get down here, Brussard. Brussard, don't! Please, Phil, don't go! Look out up there! He'll fall! Aah!
