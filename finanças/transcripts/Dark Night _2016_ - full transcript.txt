All right, so Marilyn can you tell me about Aaron as a child? As a child, he stood out from the other kids, he saw things differently and had a real gifted-- well, he was very gifted. He liked art. And he... spoke early. And he noticed things I think quicker... than kids his age. And you still care about art? Sure. What-- why do you say it like that? I'm not like an artist, you know? I'm like-- I'm like a-- I'm not really making art right now, so, you know, it's not a-- yeah. It's not like a big, you know... thing. But you don't stop being an artist. Eva, stay! Stay! Come on. Give me a kiss. We're gonna go inside. Hey, that Eddie truck! It is. Yeah? Whoa, and I got this! Hey, boy. Hey. Tennis ball. All right, come on. Mommy has to go to work. We're gonna take you to Grandma's, - come on. - To Nana's? Yup. I can't do this. Hey, guys! Welcome back to my channel. Thanks so much for being here and hanging out with me today. I have done so many vlogs lately and you guys give me the best, like, love. I have no plans on competing right now or ever, I'm not really sure. It's an idea that I've rolled around in my head and been curious about because I have so many friends who do compete and they look like they have just so much fun doing it. But they also have those really tough days that look like hell. So, I'm kind of iffy on it. I think the only reason I would compete is just to prove to myself that I can do it. And that I could dedicate myself to something so structured and strict. But, yeah, that would be one of the main reasons. For the jury, the video is a brief look inside the mind of the alleged killer taken during a mental evaluation to help determine whether Holmes was legally insane when he opened fire in a Colorado movie theater. Ordered by the court, Dr. William Reed interviewed Holmes nine times for a total of twenty-two hours. Did you think about hurting yourself or killing yourself? No. How about hurting or killing other people? Yeah, I can't kind of sleep, so-- and I'm homicidal. Bryce? So we are in agreement on this now? Because this is the last gentle warning I can give you. - Are we in agreement on this? - Yes. All right. I get a ton of questions in Instagram polls, Twitter, Facebook. And, you know, and a lot of them, they had the same questions. my friend's videos when they ask specific questions and then they So, I'm gonna go read your questions and answer them. So the first question on Instagram is, would you consider your vlog as a lot of work to do, a lot of and, yeah, so I'm every day that so yeah, I'm definitely considering it, see if I want to do it I don't like being around other people, it's-- and I have confined myself to my house. God, for a long time now. And how do you manage? Like, who gets groceries? I do, but I have to go at like 2:00, 3:00 in the morning to Walmart or somethin'. The hardest the thing for me was actually coming back and learning how to be a family member. You've got a five-year old son who can't-- I'm like, "Stop, now!" And my wife's like, "You can't yell at him." "You can't grab him." I'm like, "Ah!" Or, "Look, he can't cry." Over in Iraq, the friends I lost there, that sucked, it was horrible, but you have a way to-- you got-- you gotta do your job so you kind of... - Right, it's expected, I mean-- - And it's expected, yeah. You know not everybody's gonna come home. But then you come home and you're goin', ", man, they're still fallin'." - Yeah. - "You know, what is going on here?" It's okay, calm down. There-- I knew there's always gonna be people that are just not gonna like you. You know? They're not-- they're gonna call you an behind your back and you're never gonna hear about it. You know? Unless it's like your-- like your best friend. And-- Do you have a best friend? Yeah, over the-- over the internet. And that's about it. Because I-- we fight a lot, we fight so much but it doesn't matter, - 'cause you know? - Is it someone who you've met before in real life - or just someone you know? - Just someone I started playing with on the internet and we just never stopped talking to each other. - That's good. - Yeah. No, I-- no, I get-- I get what you're-- what you're saying. A long time-- a while ago, while I was in middle school, I remember, like, what the teachers were saying was, what kids don't understand is that when you-- when you shoot someone in real life they don't, you know, get back up and respawn. And... I think that was a little-- that was a little harsh, you know? That was a little, um... to just assume kids thought like that. No, it-- I-- kids can discern reality from a video game. I think people make those assumptions because, well, pretty much they don't play video games. Well, yeah, what is violence? Just, you know, the act of aggression or the act... of, you know, blood coming out of someone's body? No, it's actually the opposite. The people playing are actually... more immersed in what life isn't than what it is. And that's pretty much why people play video games. It's just to explore their mind, explore reality, explore different possibilities. Not so much... to, you know, be warped in some twisted reality where you get to kill people over and over again. Hey, turn to me a little bit, yeah. Come this way. I gotta get this side. Here you take this. I'll give you a little head massage while I'm at it. He kept having to pee. He peed on a tree out front of my apartment complex. Hey, that's a boy's thing, you know? We can-- I don't even... This guy. Give me that actually. No, I asked first. Rock, paper, scissors. Go. Bro, it's all right, see my wand. There two for me to get up here? Because I thought there was only one. There's my decent one and then that one you have pushed in. You have to talk about it. Yeah, I'm gonna hit that once and I've no doubt about it. I know Cheeba. Baby lungs! Baby lungs! Seem like... Yeah tastes-- - Tastes like candlewax. - It's on my hand. How do you know what candlewax tastes like? Because you can smell it. Yeah, but that doesn't mean you can taste it. It's your instincts. Jenna... Maggie... Lucas Fickle... Aaron. Luger... Tyrell... Tyjon... One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 40, 41. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, Whoo! Do you know where I can find the towels? Aisle Six. I didn't know you worked here, - Aisle Six? - I do. Yeah. Excuse me, I'm looking for a Fourth of July shirt for my husband can you direct me to the Men's Section? Yeah, last table on your left. - Oh. Thank you. - A few of us are going to the bay later, if you want to come. Sure. Oh, man. I think that-- it-- is that what school is though? Is that what-- is school one on one with a teacher? No, it's a bunch of kids in a classroom and you basically ask the smartest one, you know, how to do this and they give you the answers and then, you know, you get a B or an A on the test. And you move on, you know? There's no connection with a teacher. I don't-- that never-- that never happened. So, I don't-- I don't-- I don't, you know-- it-- I don't see the-- I don't see why college would be that hard in that aspect. You said something about, "You learn from the world." Is that about experience or what is that about? It's about just-- do you want to die-- live or die, you know? Is-- do you want to survive? Then, you will-- you will, you know, eat this-- not eat this berry and eat this berry. You know, you will not eat this mushroom and you will-- you will sleep here, you will not sleep there. You will not go to-- into that forest because there's plenty of snakes that will bite and kill you. You will not, you know, play with tigers, you will not, you know, do these certain things that will literally kill you. And that's just-- it's all about-- just one on one, you and the environment. And the environment is not a person, the environment is not a human with a brain trying to-- trying to, resonate their ideas throughout the universe. It's the nature is true, nature is real. You know, humans are not real, Human-- humans are ethereal. Humans, think they're real. And it's just, you know, it's just a bunch of bullshit. Hey, Jumper. You okay? Yeah. I stopped by a couple times and you weren't-- you weren't around. Yeah, I moved. Been touring a lot, too, so... Where did you move? Hey, I need to get online for a lesson. You can use my internet. Are you Saiga 12? Yeah. What's that, Saiga 12? It's a gun. Oh. Do you want to sing it? Yeah. ♪ You are my sunshine ♪ My only sunshine ♪ You make me happy ♪ When skies are grey Yeah, just-- it's this one, right?

She just-- she just wanted-- she wanted to express that it would be a total and complete dream to work on this project. So, she's really excited for Susan's take on it. On-- I'm sorry the casting-- the casting yesterday. Oh, Summer Young. It's just she's-- it would be a total dream. It would be, like, I mean-- this-- it's sort of, it would be such an amazing opportunity and I just really want to express that on Summer's behalf. If you could pass that along to Susan. Oh, actually, we sent a tape in. If it's possible for Susan to actually see her in person that would be really amazing. She's actually at a casting right now. She's-- it's actually a double-- or I'm sorry, a second call back. But... Sophia, you're such a bitch. But she's available this afternoon. After maybe, I guess, 4:00 PM? Do you think that you might have anything available for after 4:00 PM? Oh. Well, do you think anything maybe tomorrow? Okay, yes. Yes, exactly. So, it would be in response to the tape or if you just didn't even want to watch the tape and you just wanted to have her come on in. What the Excuse me. Oh, my God.- I don't necessarily think, he would have given me, you know, like a-- like a positive structure or a person to look up to. I just think, maybe, you know, things would be different about my personality and I'd have more self-esteem or integrity, you know? Do you agree with that, Marilyn? Aaron's his own person and I think that, yes, it helps to have a father as a role model in your life, tremendously. You know, I think probably would change-- changed some things, but I think he's done pretty well growing up and making decisions. And... What are some of the qualities that you-- that you like about him? - That you think are-- - I think... his talents, that he's very talented. He... he's not been a problem with drinking, or drugs or crime, or anything. He's not even close to that. He's been very passive and very, you know, interested in the things he likes to do. And he's been a good son. I don't know where they are, Robert. Is John home? He's overseas. Do you want money? I could get my purse. Okay. Yeah. Is that your movie star face? I sure hope so. No, I didn't like Brookside. Why not? It sucked. You just didn't like the teachers? Or the people there? No, it's just the kids there were constantly fighting me. Fighting you? - Yeah. - Why? Because they're faggots can't control their anger. Yeah, it's all right, I don't-- I don't care, it was middle school. But you don't want that when you're growing up-- you don't want to feel isolated when you're-- when-- you don't want to feel like people are against you when you're growing up. - Uh-hmm. - Just it destroys your personality. Is that a tattoo on your eye? No, it's just makeup. - It looks cool. - Thanks. The most ungrateful thing everybody's ever seen. It's too shallow. I think... That's really hard and shallow water. - Sorry. - We're making it now. - I know. - Exactly. I had it for three years. Neglected for three years actually. And I was fine. When he did give me the antibiotics, it was changing. The color of the breast, the nipple was coming back out. - So, you know, it-- - So they thought it was just the infection that it was healing itself and that you were young enough. So they needed to find out if they needed to take it out. So that's when I went to do the biopsy. And when the biopsy results came back it showed that I have breast cancer. No blood. Outside-- it was all in here. Internal bleeding. And I had a subdural hematoma and two days later, my brain hemorrhaged and shifted on the axis and they went in to suction the blood out and found it had hemorrhaged so bad that they had to remove part of my right temporal lobe and part of my frontal lobe. My whole life, and everything I've been through, that I've drawn strength from that. You know? The number of those shot is changing by the minute. Did you know that three people were pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital including the shooter? Reporters say the shooter then turned the gun on himself. Live now from Lafayette, Louisiana in the press conference. Any relationship between the shooter and the other victims? We don't know that yet. And we don't know if this was just a random act or there was a domestic situation. Do you still have that sketchbook that you showed us before? - Yeah. - Can you get it for us? I mean, yeah, I guess so. I haven't drawn in a while on it, so... I remember liking the pictures a lot. I would love to see them. Yep. What do you think? I'm learning a lot. I'm listening to him. It's painful for me sometimes. I don't think it's fair that-- because I think that he's missed out on relationships his whole life. And I think some of that... stems from maybe me being fearful too of letting him go, you know? And I have to-- I have to deal with it, I can't be in denial. And so, it's just all around not a very comfortable place sometimes for me. What do you want me to do with it? Just bring it over and look at them with your mom. - Okay. - There's a picture of a girl in there that I liked. - You know-- - No, not-- no. Hey. No. No! Hey, come here. - You want to go to Eddie? - Yeah. Yeah? Uh-hmm. Okay. Si. Okay. Uh-hmm. Bye. - Bye. - Bye. Okay. Okay. Do you feel like you're dying? Do you feel like you're about to die? That's the right feeling. Eight... nine. Okay, you can do it. You can do it, you can do it. You can do it. Okay, ten. You can do it, you can do it, you can do it. We're gonna go to 20. Eleven. You can do it. Keep the back straight. Okay, already to 12. Okay, 13. Okay, 14. Fifteen. Okay, 16. Okay, okay. Okay. Hey, Jumper. - Hey, Dan. - Where's the party? It's at the movies.
