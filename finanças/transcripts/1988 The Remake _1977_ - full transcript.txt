- My name is Thomas Steel. I'm the attorney for the makers of the film that you're about to see, "Showboat 1988." This film originally contains several references to a film called "Showboat" and to a novel by the same name by Edna Ferber. When (beep) heard about Showboat 1988, they sent letters and telegrams saying that their property rights in the original "Showboat" had suffered by virtue of this parody. This caused the distributor to drop the film and the cancellation of several showings. Now the law of copyright infringement is extremely unclear. It says basically that a person making a parody can take no more from the original than is necessary to conjure up the image of that original. The problem is, that a film maker seldom knows in advance how much the court will say is necessary to conjure up the image of the original. If you cross that shadowy line, you can be liable for copyright infringement. The problem also is that the holders of the copyright on films such as "Showboat" are ordinarily large corporations such as (beep). And a film maker can't afford to defend his right to parody in the face of the unlimited resources of those corporations. So the mere threat of a lawsuit can effectively silence a parody. The only way that the makers of this film could distribute it was by total censorship. Removing all references to the earlier film "Showboat" and thus avoiding further threats by (beep). You will hear a bleep when you would've heard the word showboat or other showboat related references. A black X will appear when showboat related graphic material would've appeared. And subtitles will indicate materials that have been deleted. The title will be changed to Showboat 1988, not the remake. As you'll hear the film describe itself, it's a musical comedy with a stench of death. As the film begins, you may just hear Paul Robeson's singing that famous Showboat tune, "Old Man (bleep)." - Every one is a star, everyone. And I wanna give them the chance to show it. And to find out for themselves. I want them to write out their fantasies in celluloid. My producer thinks it's impossible. My assistant director thinks it's impossible. And the money-men think that I'm out of my mind. That's what convinces me. Not only that it's possible, but that it's necessary. (applause) - One, two, one, two, three, four. * That old man (bleep) * That old man (bleep) * He don't need nothing * He keeps on rocking * Man old man (beep) * Well, he just, just keeps rolling along * He don't need a t-bug * He don't got a moped * He don't pay no taxes * He don't give a shit either * That old man (beep) * Well, he just, just keeps rocking, rocking along * Leave that barge * Tie up that bail * Take a little strut * And boy you're gonna get your ass in jail * - You and me, we strive in sweats and string. Bodies aching, rats, the pain. Bend your knees and bow your head Pull that rope until you're dead. But you know that old man, that old man (beep) he just keeps rolling on. Old man (beep), oh, old man (beep). Oh, old man (beep) Oh, old man (beep) Old, old man (beep) Old man (beep) Old man (beep) - [Voiceover] Hey Ed. - Huh? - [Voiceover] Lunch. - What? - It's lunch time. - Oh my god. I gotta get going. - What time you get off today? - What time I off? - Yeah. - What day is it? - [Voiceover] Find it? - Ricky's learned to like this ham too. Of course, naughty naughty the hog. Here, Squee. Not you, here. I'm off. - By the way, that letter you got from Kaiser hospital, did that have the results of your examination? - Oh, yeah, yeah. - What was the result? - Negative. It was just what Dr. Oman and I both figured. It was just to double check. - I am the executioner! A master at my craft. The executioner. One who knows where to make the cut. One who knows when to sever the self from the bones with one clean stroke. Each day just adds to the bone piles. Pile of ribs, could you give me one please? I am the executioner! - Mr. Nylund. Aren't you leaving a little early? - I'm sorry. - Cut, cut, cut! Here's the head of my last victim. I'll show you what I did to him. I'll show you how I cut. I'll show you how I cut. I'll show you, I'll show you, I'll show you how I cut. There goes another one. - So that's the story. The doctor isn't sure how long it will go. I know it's very inconvenient for me to leave right now. It's awfully inconvenient to get news like that. So I'll take this instead of the watch. - [Voiceover] Okay, George is going to... George is going to exhibit her tattoo for us now. If we can possibly get this around her everything, yes. Could you possibly zoom in on that a little bit, George? This is an actual autographed tattoo by Lyle Tuttle. You can see it says L-Y-L-E T-U-T-T-L-E. This is one of the few autographed tattoos and everything. All right. No, we mustn't have any defamatory... All right. Go ahead on, fellows and everything. - Any more? - How come you're back so early from the library? - I have a CT day, I took half day off. - I'm looking through these old scrap books. - [Voiceover] You are? - They bring back memories of old times. - [Voiceover] My sister Anne is 10 years older than I. She always, I guess, had great hopes for me. That I would become something. So 1932, I entered the University of California as a pre-medical student. And I did well. I was accepted to the medical school. And I guess that's when I kind of started falling apart. Because I lost my desire to be a physician. My sister was disappointed that I didn't go into medical school, it was partially financial too. This was during the depression, the 1930's. When, for instance, I had to borrow $25 for my registration fee. That was the total registration fee and I had to borrow that and pay it off little by little. So the going through medical school was $100. And I couldn't quite make it at that time. Turned out that I have a relative who said, "Why don't you borrow the money from me?" I had never thought of that. And unfortunately, my family had this kind of Gloomy Gus pessimistic view. They would try only up to a certain point. And I kind of learned that. So when you got to a certain point and there was defeat, you didn't try any harder. You just simply said, "Oh well, that's my fate." - You going camping? You going camping again? - Yeah. - You just went camping 10 days ago. - Yeah, I know. Well, I felt like going and I'm gonna go alone. You want the TV on? - Oh yeah, thank you. - [Voiceover] What channel? - Oh, I guess 9. - [Voiceover] San Francisco has been majored as holding open auditions for a new film, (beep) 1988. A remake of the stage and film classic using acts that are today, not an imitation of the past. He has a $10,000 grant to create what he says will be a five, or maybe seven hour film. The stars will be these people unmasking themselves. They will not get rich. There is no pay involved. But it will be their big chance to make magic on the silver screen. (applause) - [Voiceover] Hey, get out of the shot! Fuck off, you get out of that shot. - [Voiceover] What are you doing, man? - [Voiceover] Oh well, I'll make it up to you. - [Voiceover] What are you doing, Ed? - [Voiceover] I finally found you, we're gonna make a great movie. - Same old con, huh, Ed? - [Voiceover] No, not a con, I got the money. - What money? - For the movie! The great movie! - [Voiceover] What movie? What fucking movie? - (beep) 1988! (piano music) - Okay? You got it? (applause) - [Voiceover] Describe it to us. - Well, since the record player broke down and couldn't play what I was going to dance to, I would have to describe that just direct spirit call down on emergency. - [Voiceover] Direct spirit call down on emergency? It's a very existential title there. Where did you get that title from? - Well, I'm putting that into words as best as I can. - [Voiceover] Very good. That's the words that came to you about your act? - That's right. - How long has it taken you to develop this act? - It took about 24 years for me to strip off a lot of levels, layers, excuse me, of trips and images that I felt I had to go through. - This is like a culmination of 24 years. Are you 24? - Yeah. - All right. So this is like you at 24. - Yeah, deciding that I want to do something that hasn't been handed in, produced for me. - All right. - [Voiceover] My name is Darryl Wagner. - 108. - I'm going to dance for you. (dramatic music) - [Voiceover] Ed, I can't keep handing these guys the shit. I mean, they laugh in my face. Either you get big names or you forget it. - I don't want big names. I don't want Zaneck, I don't want Betty Davis. Hollywood would poison this film. I want a sidewalk (beep). - Ed, do you wanna make a movie? Or do you wanna stay in this ridiculous suite until they throw us out? Look, I've got six bucks, do you want it? That won't even pay for breakfast. You're making a movie, Ed. - Skip, we've got $10,000. Dick and I are gonna pick it up tomorrow morning. - [Voiceover] Where, Ed? - I want a film that comes out of America. A film America gives to itself instead of buying a pre fap from Hollywood. I wanna give the means of production. a production of images, back to the people. I'd like to thank you for your patience. We've set this up because this is a historic moment. I'd like to introduce the man who has given us and has provided most of the money for this production. The producer, Skip Covington. (applause) Thank you, Skip. Then the man who has done a lot of the dirty desk work, under the hatchet work. And this is the person that I have to rely upon. And this is Dick Richardson, the assistant rescue. (applause) - You're the big boys. - Yeah. - How's it feel? - Feels pretty good. I don't know, I'm kind of disappointed in the talent that we've seen so far. - Here's my card. Here's my card. - Well, I don't have anything to do with this, could you take it to the stage manager, he's right over there. - [Voiceover] Who's that, somebody that's late? - Yeah, he's late. We had a lot of them around here, we've had a lot of trouble with the numbers and keep them in style. - Skip, what was that? - [Skip] Oh, some guy had a card. He didn't know what to do with it. - [Voiceover] Oh, yeah, that's the same one. - [Voiceover] Oh, okay. - Testing. Good evening. Sorry about that. My name is Rich Perr, and I'm going to do some sound effects for you. - [Voiceover] Wait a minute. What is this, the Ed Sullivan show? Could you... - Skip, Skip. - [Voiceover] All right. On our stage, we have with us from Mona, California. The entire cast and crew... - [Voiceover] Ladies and gentlemen, (beep) it's a fabulous thing. - Wait a minute, wait. I don't think you quite understand what's going on her. - [Voiceover] Skip, Skip. - Could you do something... - We had an agreement, we had an agreement about this. - Wait a minute. - We talked about this already. It's a sidewalk show, they come in. - Go ahead. - [Voiceover] I grew up in the 50's so I was raised with radio, right? They didn't have television. So I had all those great little things they listened to, all those imaginary sounds in the background. Little things like... And then he would go... And it was always... - This is upsetting? - It's upsetting for me, yes. Because, as far as I can see, we can't use this man. - [Voiceover] Skip, cool it, cool it. - I can't be here... - [Voiceover] What are you really looking for? - [Voiceover] Flavor. How did you get into the theatrical field in the first place? - [Voiceover] Why don't you take it easy? - [Voiceover] Skip, Skip. - Listen. - [Voiceover] I used to make sound effects with my mother. We used to sit in the kitchen, we didn't have too many modern appliances, so we would takes things like garbage disposal. - [Voiceover] I think this is one of the most honest acts we've seen tonight. And yet the producer and the director both feel uptight. What's happening? - Just give him a chance. Let him go and then... - I'll tell you what's wrong with me is that, we're spending my money and you've got all this shit on the stage that we can't even use. - We don't have to have him in the show. We can cut him out, that's the whole thing. We agreed upon that. - [Voiceover] All right, all right. Let's just listen then. In a movie, even more than a play. You have to think about cost, because you have to think about film and crew. The settings like what this hall is costing us. And you've gotta think about all those things. And you gotta also think about the fact that you've got... Very little time to do it in. Very little time. - So you're prostituting it? Your own creativity, your own hopes and desires in a 20th century model, economic model. So you in fact, are as much a victim as the people on stage. You're frustrated, you're looking for something. Everyone on stage is looking for something. When will the two images combine? - I wanna make the movie and I gotta get at least 10,000 15,000 dollars. But I don't know how to get it. - Get it from the bank. - The bank? How do I do that? - Get it from the bank. Use your house and get it from the bank. - How? - A loan. - The house? Oh my god, that would be a mess. - What the hell. - A regular mess. - What are you worried about? - Don't you understand the setup? My sister and I are co-owners. - If you really wanna do this. - We're co-owners. - Ed, don't worry about that. - If she ever finds out, if she ever finds out. My god, that will just blow the whole thing. I can't do that. - If she finds out after the movie, it's okay. Just don't worry about those things. You have the deed? - I go to the bank, right? - You hold the deed? - Well, I can get it. - Okay. Get the deed. - So I sign it and then what do I do? - We'll take care of that. We'll work that out. - The Y is all wrong. - [Voiceover] Here, second page. - Hey, man, do you want anyone to believe this or not? I mean... - [Voiceover] What are you getting for this, 100 bucks? - I don't know. - [Voiceover] Need a 100 bucks? - I need to get this right. - [Voiceover] Here. - [Ed] No, it won't work. - [Voiceover] Two, three. - [Ed] I won't do it. It doesn't feel good. - [Voiceover] Just sign that right here. Come on. - [Ed] Dick, listen to me. I can't do it. - [Voiceover] I gave you a 100 bucks before, as I recall. Right there. - [Ed] Dick. - [Voiceover] Ed. Go back to the bed and lay down, huh? Come on. Not now, later, go on. - [Ed] Do you think it'll work? Can we get by with it? - [Voiceover] Ed, go back to the bed and lay down. I don't wanna talk about these things now. - [Ed] Listen. All right. - [Voiceover] Ed, leave me alone. - [Ed] I'll make a bargain with you. I'll make a bargain. - [Voiceover] Ed, you're bothering me at the moment. - [Ed] I'll go to the bank with you. - [Voiceover] Will you respect that for the moment? - [Ed] I'll go to the bank with you. But you have to carry it, I don't wanna touch that thing. - [Voiceover] All right, that's a deal. - [Ed] Okay? - [Voiceover] Yes. Take a nap, partner, okay? - [Voiceover] After world war 2, the G.I. bill made it possible for me to go to the Manhattan school of music. I was a good cellist already and been playing the cello since junior high school. My wife in many ways was a disappointment to me, because she ran off just before I was supposed to get a degree in musicology. And to me, I still don't understand that. And even my son, the birth of my son was a disappointment. Because what it did was that it upset the business of studying for the master's degree. I haven't seen him now for about 20 years. And then I start to get kind of conscience stricken so I phoned him. First time that I communicated in any way, tried to communicate with him for a long time. So I offered to take him to Death Valley, to take him on a vacation with me. And turned out to be a kind of a... That was also a kind of a turn down because he couldn't do anything about it. He thanked me kind of formally. And said that his mother, my former wife, had cancer. Skip, I want you to be the producer. Okay? And Dick. - [Voiceover] Yes sir. - I like you for the assistant director, all right? - [Voiceover] All right. - [Ed] Good. - [Voiceover] And I'm your (beep), right? - [Ed] Excuse me? - [Voiceover] I'm your (beep), right? - Oh yeah. Well, listen. Why don't we wait until we're finished. When we finish the auditions, you know. And then what we're gonna do is choose the one that's best for the part, see. I think you have a very good chance. - A chance? - A good chance. - A chance? That part is mine, I better get that part. - What do you mean? - I committed a crime for you. I forged your sister's name so you could get the money and I could go to jail for that. To jail, do you understand? This film is just as much mine as it is yours. Maybe more - Look... - I don't think you get that part. I'm gonna get it or you're gonna be in a lot of trouble. - Okay, now wait a minute. I don't think you understand the situation. What we're doing may not be a literal remake of (beep) or of the film. So as we go along, we haven't planned that. - I don't care. I just wanna know if I have that part after what I've done. Am I your (beep)? - Absolutely. Absolutely. - [Voiceover] Maybe this is getting into something personal again, but is your son, Willie Walkard, going to have anything to do with this production? - No, I haven't seen... - [Voiceover] What you don't understand is that his son, Willie Walkard, hasn't anything to do with him in many years. He's neglected him and he has not been responsible to Ed as a father. I shouldn't... This is off the record but... - Come on now, come on now. - I really think you ought to leave that aside. - She can understand that. It doesn't have to be explained. - I don't want you to get upset and excited. - Dick, Dick. I'm not upset and excited. - Those kinds of questions. Just stick to questions about the production. - She's a grown up. - If you wanna get into politics, be in politics. But leave his son alone, please. - [Voiceover] Let's ask about some of the characterization in the film. I've looked at the script a little bit. All the characters seem extremely complex. Would you like to talk about some of the characterization in the film? - Well, to me the whole thing is absurd. Because the greatest song, one of the great songs in all of American musical literature, you know what it is? - What's that? - Old man (beep). - What does that song mean to you? - And even now, when I try to think... What is the name? What's the name of the guy who sings Old man (beep) from the thing? One of the great songs of American music is sung by a stevedore. A black stevedore. - Do you see this film, then, as having some sort of social intentions? Some kind of political consciousness? - It was a breakthrough in its time, yeah. At least it didn't have the can can girls going up and down like that. At least you have some kind of realism. In a sense, as my ambition, I'd like to, and I haven't quite settled it, I'd like to bring the stench of death to the musical comedy. - Hi, I'm an unemployed housewife. Well, not really. You seen, my old man, he kind of walked out on me. Well, I really thought we had something going. I really did. I used to drink a little but wasn't... Wasn't anything really big. I never had a hangover. I just stayed drunk. I guess the only time I looked good to him was on Halloween. - Thank you very much. (applause) Would you like to try it? - Right here? - Yeah, could do it? This is (beep) from (beep). - My name is Bermuda Schwartz. - My name is Ladi Da. And you're not gonna believe this, but... * You make the people of hell smell so swell * So who am I to say too strong * But Sam, you make the pants too long * - Mick Jagger would love to be that savior. But it ain't him, no. The rock and roll star in his highest state of grace would be the new savior. Rocking to Bethlehem to be born. You know what I mean? (laughter and applause) * Sure as the star wherever we are it's... * Wherever... - That's too high. Can you make it lower? * When tears are in * Your eyes * I will dry them all * I'm on your side * Oh, when times get rough * It's only... - Oh, that's not it. - [Voiceover] Try this on. - Try again. * It's only a trailer in paradise park * I'll live there in sunshine and also the dark * And I'll sing me a tune * At midnight or noon * And the landlord can't tell me * Just when I can broom * I'll practice the trumpet and fiddle a bit * I'll play the piano and write me a nit * My neighbors won't care if I sing like lark * In a trailer in paradise park * - So they wouldn't let me sing at the office. Me. And I had worked my ass off for that corporation. - [Voiceover] Thank you. - You're welcome. (applause) - Love. L is for love is love. O is for oh, what love. V is for victory, walk away with victory. E is for earth, the mother of love. Love. Love. Love. The next one is titled "Love is." Love is the beauty of intelligence. Love is the basic truth. Love is respect. Love is freedom. Love is the ultimate power of the universe. Love is the shape of mother earth's heart pump. Pop. Pop. Bop. Love is. Love is. - Right now, my heart is beating very strongly. Because I enjoy being up before you and loving you and I hope that you love me too. What I'd like to do is just kind of improvise in regards to some of what I've seen tonight. And a lot of what we're experiencing and a lot of people are experiencing around us. When we come into the world, everything is very quiet. When we are in our mother's womb, everything is very quiet. What I'd like to do right now is... Simply present to you a little act of love. I notice a scene here on the wall. As a little baby just starting after an act of love. About a period of 9 months from back here and we start getting thrust forward to go through the road of life. And as we look a little closer, we see the trees and they're outstretched and they're a little scary and maybe that's a little warning. But anyway we don't have much to say about it because... About 9 months, we're about ready to be ejected from our mother's womb. Everything's quiet. But all of a sudden some bastard hits us on the ass to hear us cry. Then we go to school and people yell at us. And our mothers and our fathers yell at us. And our brothers and our sisters yell at us. And worst of all, we start yelling at them. And it doesn't end just in the home. As soon as we go out into the street, we get to hear more of that fantastic, beautiful noise. Street cars, airplanes, everything that you can imagine that drive you crazy. Sometimes you wish, you wish, even though you're an artist, and you love the people, that you didn't have to get on the stage and do a damn thing. But just stand there and say, I'm me and I love you. And I wish the world would freeze. I wish everything would stop and there was no noise. - [Voiceover] Thank you. (applause) * She gave him the money to pay her band * But he left her flat in the county jail * - Here I come, you ready? Are you ready? * Ho di ho di ho * Da di doo da de - [Voiceover] Thank you. - [Voiceover] You didn't... All right, it wasn't even finished, mister. - [Voiceover] That ain't in our show. - [Voiceover] Thank you. (applause) - All right, how you doing? I just got off from work. I work, I drive a bus in the city here. I'm from the city. Right now, I'm just gonna go into transaction is what I call it. I'm the only human in the world at this particular time that can go into transaction. Everyone is capable of going into transaction. That means sort of another dilemma. Another world. So it'll take me about 30 seconds to go in a transaction, then I'll sing whatever comes out. (applause) * Ohhh * Hello, everybody * My name is Nate * I drive a bus in the city * Ohhh * I study Cruso * And I studied El Dino too * La la * Each night we have a quarrel * It almost breaks my heart * Each night I ask the stars up above * Why must I be a teenager in love * In love * Must I be a teenager, in love * In love - I know the answer to our dilemma. No more dilemmas. I have found the puzzle. I have solved it. We're all in a dilemma because we don't know who we are. But I have found the answer. We're all the same. We are just unique, read B.F. Skinner. Read anyone you may. You will find the answer too. * For we all are the same * There's no difference, not really * - Dance with Francis and Anna. - We've only been doing this dance, it's true, for five years. - [Voiceover] I'd like to know about... What is your dream about dancing? - We've had a dream to be with Lawrence Wob, is what we wanted to do. To get in his program, to show all of the people, all the people in the world, what can be done when you love music and give it everything. That people can do like we do. We've given all we have. (applause) - Sister Rose. * We ain't got a barrel of money * Maybe we're ragged and funny * I'll just travel along * Singing a song * Side by side * We all got our trouble and heartache * We'll be the same as we started * But we'll travel along * Singing a song * Side by side (laughter) - Benny, come here. (laughter) (dog barking) Benny, come here. (applause) (choral music) Here, Benny. Benny. Here, Benny. (applause) - Hi, Ed, how you doing? Didn't think you were coming. Your sister said you went camping. I saw you on the noon news, though. You're getting to be quiet a celebrity. Well, there it is. Little beauty. Yeah, the... Have you seen the news yet? They showed some of the acts that you shot last night. - (mumbles) on TV? - Yeah, it was on two channels. At noon. Some of the acts... I knew you were gonna do a film, but I didn't have any idea that you could use acts like that in a remake of (beep). Unless it's some other (beep). You cancelled last week to go camping. You must do a lot of camping. Okay. Well, we'll have you taken care of here in just a minute. I've always been interested in show business. Of course, you know that. Every time you come in, I do my little Weber and Fields square. This must be the place. Hey, that's pretty good. Maybe we can make up an act ourselves. Okie dokie. Your sister said that your son's back in town. There you go. Okay, let's keep it there. Hang in there, hang in there. Just a little while longer. You're all right? Now close down. - There's a man named Willie Walkard who's in the waiting room and wants to see Mr. Nylund. - Hold it, hold it, hold it. We're cementing this in now. Hold it. Mr. Walkard? - [Voiceover] Yes. - All right, you keep that still there until I come back. Excuse me. - Tomorrow's really gonna be hard. I'm tired. Your wrecked boy. I'm very tired. - We gotta get all of this... - [Voiceover] How you doing? - [Voiceover] Okay. - [Voiceover] How you been? - [Voiceover] Good. My seat. What's the matter, isn't this one good enough for you anymore? - What the hell is wrong with you tonight? My pleasure. - You know that Willie Walkard. I always try to... I have to keep not calling him Billy. Willie Walkard, my own flesh and blood. You should've heard what he... The ideas that he gave me for making the... - Hey, Ed, we did a lot of nice things tonight. Ed, Ed. Will you just, one second. We did a lot of nice things tonight. I wanna tell you, we filmed them. And some of them were just great. - The thing was that... He wants me to think of as purely documentary terms. Now, one of the things that was really nice about it. I told you about this touch of death, smell of death that I was doing. That was just a... A kind of a strong idea to hang onto. I was gonna shape it and Willie straightened me out. He really did it. - [Voiceover] That's real nice, I had that idea a week ago. - The documentary, the documentary I get... - [Voiceover] I guess our timing was off, huh? - The documentary, don't interrupt. - [Voiceover] Really, today is a good idea. Last week it's not good. - [Ed] He told about Tippy Stewart, supposed to be one of the best documentary men. He's down in Louisiana now, and he's gonna bring him up. - Tippy Stewart, I know personally. I told you about him three months ago when we first discussed the idea. - No, I don't remember that. That's not... - [Voiceover] Convenience to loss of memory, I think. Listen, Ed. - [Ed] Willie's idea. - [Voiceover] A few hours ago, so... Finish your argument? I'll talk to you, huh? - Yeah, okay. I won't talk about that deal we have. - Up until a few weeks ago, or up until a few hours ago Willie Walkard was nothing but a Hollywood politic man. He comes by here... - He's helping me. - [Voiceover] Why repeat the point, you telling me about Willie Walkard. - [Ed] I don't want to, just let it go. If you can't relax now, just stop. - I'm relaxed, I'm relaxed. You're screaming and I'm relaxed. - [Ed] I'm excited because I got some good ideas from him. - That's great, that's great. - They were swell. - [Voiceover] Okay, look. Maybe tomorrow night we'll discuss this a little more. I mean... I think maybe you should relax a little bit. Or maybe I think maybe there's not enough room on this set for the three of us. - [Ed] You're probably right. - David Louis, channel 7 news. Tonight's the last night if you really wanna get in on that new movie version of (beep). They are at 7 o'clock in the California hall. That's turk and polk streets in the tenderloin. And I bet you'll have to race Jim Dunbar there because he's always wanted to take the stage, right? - [Voiceover] I always have. * No more (applause) - Not bad. - Do you find it's hard to get back into your own personality? - I play myself every minute of the day and if they think I'm somebody else, that's their business. - It all started when I had this fear of whipped cream, and I said, to overcome it, I should just squirt it all over my body, you know? And my next goal is to overcome my fear of potato chips. (cheering) (applause) - I first started out singing and dancing. Then I teamed up with a girl partner who was really fat and a great comedian. So we toured around the country. She married up, the leader of the band. So I had to get a new nightclub act. And I wanted to do something different. So I went into this. - What kind of relationship do you have with the snake? - Well, I consider him my friend. He's a pet to me. He's not just something to dance with but he makes a very wonderful pet. - Do you think he has a distinct personality? - Oh yes. I know what he's going to do and which way he's going to move. And whether he's happy or unhappy. * Do your ear hang low, * Do they wobble to and fro * Can you pull them in a knot * Can you tie them in a bow * Can you sling one over your shoulder * Like a continental soldier * Do your ear hang low (applause) - Well, I'm a canyard from near San Francisco and part of my platform is, if erected, I intend to walk around this city completely nude to prove that there's nothing obscene, pornographic or indecent about my body or anyone else's body. A nude body is a work of art created to admire, adore, and appreciate. And it's time that people stopped hiding behind clothes. - [Voiceover] Do you think that there's any contraction in that your clothes are so colorful and so pleasing to look at? - Yes, but they're all part of experiments. I'm doing experiments concerning nuclear energy, telepathy and some very advanced things through the use of drugs. I advocate the use of drugs by everyone. I'm becoming super intelligent and advancing into evolution at a more rapid rate than the rest of the population. I'm attempting to set up a psychic institute for other people advancing at a more rapid rate. - Would you direct your super intelligence to the group of people in this room and tell us what you think of them? What do you think of the people who are gathered here tonight? - I haven't seen the entire group perform. And I won't be able to stick around very long because I'm going to group of loved citizens. So I'd rather not make any... - Your daughter plate dinner? - No, I don't... I'm a very rich man but I have no money. - Have you gotten those questions more resolved in your mind now? - Yes. One of the questions I wanted to ask was if a musical comedy is an inherently bourgeoisie form. - Have you made any decisions on that? - Yes, it is. - And it is an inherently bourgeoisie form. - Yes. - And so what can we do about that? - I think there should be a little more self reflectiveness in the acts. I would like to see the people have a little more knowledge about what it is they're doing. And for the people on the production crew to have slightly more I don't wanna say humanistic, but slightly more conscious attitude about their relationship to the people in the auditorium. - Thank you very much, Constance, I think we have to cut away now. (making wind noises) (laughter) (applause) - We'll wait just a second til the applause calms down. We're having quite an evening here at the auditions. JC, would you just bring me up to date on your career real briefly? What have you been doing the last 10 years since I saw you? - Last 10 years, I had a stroke in 66 on November the 26th. - Right after I saw you. - I stayed in Laguna Honda hospital for five years. I came out, I went to therapy for the rest of three years and I started back with playing in 74. And now here I am trying the best I can. (clapping) * I'll drink my way * Into LA * Evening sun was going down * I'll beat my way into LAC there * Keeps on going down * I try to get me a new job * They try to throw me down * I called it queer * Out in LA * It was 16 cold * days long called it * Fly to LAC there * 16 cold days long * I did not know where we're going * Go daisy hang right on * Now here I am * In San Francisco * And I'm doing best I can * And here I am right now * Doing the best I can * But I got so rich to tell * About that blue highway mess * Lost where my mother father pew * Go about what they did * Blue sky will be making * Moonlight Bobby's back * But I'm not ashamed, ain't that new * I'm the man * Gonna be blue * I'm gonna head on * I'm having to * Get by on with living with blue * (applause) * Come on to my place * Watching every move on her face * As a child * I don't think love will last * She said love * Love bug * Now you're trying to trick me, love * All right now * Baby you should, all right now * Just ease you * All right now * Honey you should, all right now * All right * All right - Willie. Where are the cigarettes? - Oh, they're here. - Can I have one please? - Sure. Would you like a menthol or a menthol? - It doesn't matter, does it? You think Magnolia smokes in bed? - Awful as a French movie, maybe. Something a little European. - Maybe Magnolia wouldn't be in bed. Okay? - I don't know. I don't know about this Magnolia stuff. I just came up here. - What do you mean? Have at it. - You're taking this whole thing pretty serious, this movie business, aren't you? - Sure. I mean this is a pretty big part. Magnolia's a very fascinating character. - God. Let me tell you something. This isn't even a real movie. I mean, it couldn't possibly be a real movie. - This movie? - That's right. - What do you mean it's not a real movie? - My father is a... Cannot make a movie on the budget he has. There is... This is the movie, what you see here. The auditions are the movies. There is no Magnolia. No Magnolia. - You mean you're trying to tell me that your father is just having all those people come down there just for nothing? - It's his last dream. It's the last gasp, you know? It's like the most expensive home movie ever made. Everybody involved in it in this city at this audition is like a big family to him. It can't, it's not professional at all. But it's nothing there. It's not gonna be shown in any theaters. How could it be? - My name is Billy Barksdale. - [Voiceover] Hi Billy. - Hi. * I love the name Billy * My dad's was the same Billy * I love the way they laugh and say * How silly to call that girl Billy * Baffles them all, Billy * For after all, Billy * They think it's so queer * That a girl should appear * Their illusions, I fear, I destroy * Here is the reason my name's Billy * My parents expected a boy (applause) (piano music) (applause) - No cause for alarm out there because I'm on your side. Yes, that's right. And I'm a space age comedian. I do metaphors of the future. This first one is my impression of the typical martian freeway at rush hour. (laughter) (applause) - Thank you, thank you. - [Voiceover] What other kinds of talents does he have? - He really doesn't have any talent, actually. He just think she does. - My sister thought I was nuts. But I was not nuts. That's it. (applause) - [Voiceover] Okay, why did you pull her off? Why did you pull her off? - I wasn't even watching what she was doing. (applause) (upbeat music) - Everyone has a right to life. Victims, not so much as other people. But victims have a right to life too. Victims have a right to life too. - What do you constitutes a victim? - Excuse me, we have another... - [Voiceover] Check sound. - Just one. Well, Mary, about victims. There are a lot of victims. I think we're all victims basically. I'm certainly a victim. You seem like a victim. - Well, I don't consider that... That's a pleasure. * I'm gonna dance dance dance, gonna fly * I'll take a chance chance chance, riding high * Before my number's up, I've got to fill * I'm gonna live live live live live * Until I die (applause) - Stage is the closest paradigm to death that we have yet found. - I see. So everyone in this room is essentially a death freak. - Yes, right. Waiting their turn to die. - Waiting... - By the numbers. (applause) (cheering) (piano music) * Blackbirds singing in the dead of night * Take these broken wings and learn to fly * All your life * Oh, you've been waiting for the moment to arise * Oh yeah * Blackbirds singing in the dead of night * Why don't take these sunken eyes and learn to see * All your life * I am waiting for the moment to be free * Oh yeah * Blackbird, blackbird fly * Blackbird, blackbird * Why don't you clap on blackbird * Why don't you clap on blackbird * Why don't you clap on blackbird * Why don't you clap on blackbird * Why don't you clap on blackbird * Blackbird singing in the dead of night * Take these broken wings and learn to fly * All your life * You've been waiting for the moment to arise * Blackbird singing in the dead of night * Take these sunken eyes and learn to see * All your life * You've been waiting for the moment to be free * Oh blackbird fly * Oh blackbird fly * Oh you've been waiting for the moment to arise * (applause) - Well well. - Such a great act. - It's a great, but she doesn't fit into (beep). Look at the songs, look at this. What is she gonna sing? There's no song in there for a woman playing a piano to sing. There's nothing there for her. - So you've absconded from your creative potential. - You keep accusing me. - Yeah? Well maybe that's because I feel like, if I would like to sing for you. - Why don't you go sing? - But I'm not going to. - Why not? - Because you don't want me and I know that already. - How do you know that? - I know that because your eyes are closed. And because your head is closed and your heart is closed. And everybody connected with this piece. It's been closed. They've been closed from the beginning. It's been complete take trip. Take take take, take from all these people. And you don't even know what you've taken. You haven't even gained anything, and you've taken. - Well okay. - Soul's gold, man. - I'll tell you the truth then. I'll tell you the truth. - Okay, I'd really like to hear the truth. - I felt very much like a traitor to my own profession. - Well, I hope so. - From the beginning of this whole thing. Because, here I am, I'm an actor. Who's been hired to perform the role of a producer. I sit at this table, a table that I'd been on the other side of a 100 times. I'll admit it, it was maybe an ego trip on my part. In the beginning, I thought, yeah, revenge. I can get on the other side of that people and I can tell those people Fuck off. Fuck off my stage. Just like a lot directors have told me. - [Voiceover] Listen, this is a movie, right? This is a movie that they're making, I'm in it. They told me they were gonna pay me, right. Everything I did on the stage was set up. This guy. This guy riding the camera right here? He's the director, not this man down here. You think he's the director. He is no more a producer than I'm a horse. Listen, I want you to know that I'm pissed off. - Wait a minute. - [Voiceover] I had to tell everybody, I'm fucking tired of listening to all these people getting fucked up. I want you to know. You, you're the one. I want you to direct. You gonna direct me? You wrote me a part in a script. I sat here for nine hours, I didn't do anything. I'm sick and fucking tired of this. And I want you to know, this man right here. See, he takes a picture of me. Because he's gonna use it in a movie and he's gonna make money off of me. Off of you. - [Voiceover] You came here to audition for (beep). That's exactly what you're doing. If your act is good, we need it, we'll use it. And if there's money made, you'll make it too. Not just us. - [Voiceover] Is he lying? Who's telling the truth here? - [Voiceover] A thing or two is telling the truth. Who tells the truth about anything? - But you just told me that this is the show and this is the boat. Is this the show and is this the boat? - This is the show and this is the boat. - And what the fuck is the boat? - [Voiceover] Responsible enough for themselves that you have to have this fucking guy up here. - Who are these guys? They all look like drug addicts. - This guy... He's the assistant director right here. I don't know who this dude is over here. I don't know what he's doing. - Are you telling me the truth? Who really is the director? Who really is the producer? Who's paying for this? - All I'm asking you, has there been something else like this in San Francisco where you could come in off the streets and show whether you have a talent. Whether you have some kind of glory in your soul. Tell me. You want, should we end it then? - [Voiceover] How many of you don't care what happens to your hair? How many of you don't care what's done with your images that are taken here? - I read fancy. - Do any of you care what happens to you anymore? - [Voiceover] Are there any of you who are not responsible enough for themselves that you have to have this fucking guy up here asking you if you can take care or yourselves or not? - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm gonna call the auditions and stop them. No more. - Fucking Z. - It's not her fault. We didn't tell her about the telephone call. - Well, I wonder how Ed's taking all this. - You're the movie people, aren't you? What kind of movie are you making? - It's a musical comedy. - The stench of death. - Oh that's funny. I just saw a movie the other night, The Duchess of Malfi. It was an Elizabethan tragedy. 14 players were killed in the end. - Oh yeah? - Yeah, the final scene. The head spy Borsola walks in, and he walks up to the duke Ferdinand. And he says, "Hi, Duke." And he gets it right in the duke goes... The duke can't breathe but the duke was prepared for him. He says, "How you doing Borsey?" Zips it up and Borsola's walking around... In walks the cardinal (mumbles) You know, then wham. Then the cardinal begins to reel. The cardinal exhales, you know. That's the cardinal as Borsola is jabbing it into his groin. The cardinal says, "You son of a bitch." - Who's that? - I just came to get my things. - [Voiceover] I'll do it. - [Voiceover] I don't have time. - [Voiceover] There's something we haven't told you. Ed's dying of cancer. - [Voiceover] That's the Borsola, you know, bounces off the... And he says, the cardinal walks over him says, "That asshole. I've got him that time." And then the duchess comes in and of course.. She's being strangled, they had one person on one side, one on the other. Do you understand how the thing develops, it's like Borsola, then the cardinal, the Giovana, Giovana.. And she's swinging back and forth because one guy's holding the string on this end, and the other guy's holding it on this end. You know? You don't know. - [Voiceover] Hey, hey listen to this! Listen, listen. You've gotta hear this. I got a call from a guy... - Sit down, Ed. - Thank you. Listen. I got a call, a guy wants to give me a quarter of a million dollars, and we're gonna go to New York, Atlanta, Memphis, everything. The whole thing is broken open now. We've busted through the sound barrier, right? And we can do anything we want, see? Everything's there. I just got a call. - We heard you, Ed. The first time. We also called the library, Ed. We spoke to Miss Burts. - Why didn't you tell us you were sick, Ed? I think ought to talk about that. - Why you asking me? - You're dying, Ed. You must have some feelings about it. - Dying? Look at you, shooting all that heroin into your system and into your veins. - This is cocaine and it's proven there's nothing wrong with it. - But we had an understanding. You're ruining your body, you're just dragging yourself down. - Ed, don't worry about me. - What are you doing? - Don't worry about me, man. - What are you doing to yourself? - I couldn't take it. I couldn't take it, Ed. - Couldn't take what? - Don't worry about me. I mean what do you want from me? - I want you to finish (beep). - What? - I don't know whether I can finish. - You're crazy. - It's my legacy to you. - You're crazy. This is your film, Ed. Your film. You die, it dies. - No. - Period. - [Voiceover] Perhaps I should explain something, ostensibly, I, Ed Nylund was the director of Showboat 1988. Of course, that wasn't really true. The real director of it and organizer of it was fellow named Rick Schmidt. And he actually did the camera work and did all the production and all of the directorial work. All the planning. And it always seems as if, in my life, when I do important things or interesting things, I only do it because I'm reluctant. Then someone kind of pushes and shoves or pulls or yanked me over there to do it. So the upshot of it is, that I still work at the library, I haven't seen my son and my relationship with my former wife has just stayed the same as it was, no communication. So I think that the, probably, the best ending would be to show somehow that life goes on. And someone else will be coming along. And will be taking these risks and making the rainbow. Doing the dangerous thing. And so it would be nice if it just continued to show that there's a flow. And that it's always happening. And always must happen. To human beings who are really alive.
