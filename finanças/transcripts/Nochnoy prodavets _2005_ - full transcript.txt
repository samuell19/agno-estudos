THE GRAVEYARD SHIFT ...sources report that catching the maniac ...is only a question of time... THE GRAVEYARD SHIFT - What have you decided? - To go back to the University. - A student again, living off me? - I work. - As what? A shop salesman? - So what? - Selling vodka to alcoholics? - They're people too. You used to work days, now nights - there's no difference. I want to change my life. You want to live off me again. A night salesman's a good job... such jobs don't come easy. And I can study there. My brother's got a good job. He imported this car, and he'll bring a Mercedes next. I'm having a hard time right now, you know. I'll start back at University, study in the day, work at night. I don't plan on living off you. You can't cope, working and studying. I'll cope - I've worked it all out. I just need a quiet, easy job. There are few customers at night. What sort of job is hanging round in a shop all night? - It's a great job. - Trading cars is a great job. FOOD. 24 HOURS. End of your stretch - conscience clean? - Many nutcases today? - Same as usual. SECURITY - Where's Casanova? - He's sick. You're on your own. Right. - You going to count up? - Forget it. - Where's the boss? - On his way. He's got insomnia. Me too. GOLDEN BARREL - This won't last all night. - If it runs out, I'll come in. I live close by. - How's the weather? - It's going to rain. Definitely won't sleep then. - Where's Casanova? - Not here. What? He's sick. Back home, hugging his pillow. So... - So, you're on your own? - Looks that way. - Not scared? - Of who? - Well... me, perhaps... - Not really. - This your first time on nights? - Yes. I've got my textbooks. I'm studying for exams. Maybe I'll pass this time. - What would you like? - Marlboro and a couple of Millers. And a pack of condoms... Strawberry-flavored, if you got them. - My husband hasn't come? - No. - Is this beer good? - Help yourself. - I don't think I parked the car very well. - Left it in the middle of the road? No, right in front of the entrance. Don't you think that's a mistake? It's night, there aren't any cars. What's the problem? No, I'd better park it round the back. I'll come back and finish the beer. Don't want anyone to see it... You have to be so careful. She came to see Casanova, but he's sick. She's coming back. We're just drinking a beer. So, strawberry flavored... - The label had a strawberry on it. - But have you tried one? I won't lay a finger on her! - Have you heard? What is that? - Someone's come in. Go on, quick... quick. You're on your own tonight. The guard's sick. Will you manage? No problem. - First time on nights? - Yes. - You know the rules? - Sort of. No smoking at the counter. - And no shutting the shop. - I know. We can't let the customers down. Some guy's out there in a downpour, and the shop's shut. And he was sure the shop was open. - Got it? - Right. You can't deride a man like that. If my wife comes, tell her I'm at the casino. - She can go there. - Alright. I'll go and change. - Right, I'm off... Keep an eye out. - Alright. - Your husband dropped in. - And what did he say? - He's gone to the casino. - Hmm. But, as you can see, I'm delayed... - What, you didn't lock the door again? - Quiet... they'll hear. Quick... quick! - You can't smoke here. - Really? The management banned it. What's that, then? Alright, smoke. We'll make an exception. - Work all night? - Yes. - You've got an alibi then. - What alibi? I only sold you some cigarettes. No laws broken. - I mean, you're eighteen. - How do you know? You've seen my passport? The police wouldn't take you on, if you weren't eighteen. - Wouldn't take me? - No. I see you're a real kidder. This one's no kidder though. Oh my God! Their faces... are blue. Because all the blood's drained out of them. And each has got a bruise on the hand. From handcuffs. The maniac puts handcuffs on his victims, and then takes their entrails out. That's the sort of clients we have here... I see. Yours is the only shop open in the neighborhood. So? - You're alone, no guard. - So? You underestimate him. - Who? - The maniac. Half of our customers are maniacs. Alright, just wanted to warn you. You're my responsibility here. And the next three blocks to the north. Got it. I'll keep my eyes peeled. If I see anything suspicious, I'll... Bottle of vodka. - You know him? - An average customer. - Seen him before? - I think so. Right, I'm off. - You see anything - let me know. - How? - I'll drop in again. - Alright. I'll be back. - Don't stop... don't stop! - She's right, don't stop. Thank God it's you. You scared me, man. - I haven't even heard the bell. - You were too busy. - You didn't lock the door again? - I locked it. - I've got a key. - Hey, this is just a misunderstanding. Of course, my lovelies... a misunderstanding... Some joke! My heart nearly stopped. - Couldn't you knock? - I don't like being let down. It's just, man, she came to see Casanova but... he's sick. You understand. - It's got nothing to do with me. - It's me it's got nothing to do with. You'd better just keep quiet. And you saw nothing. - There's no need for that. - Bastard... - But I like the set up we've got here. - Get lost... You see, it's all because of the rain... ...and the rain made Casanova sick, and then she comes along. - You think the rain's to blame? - Of course. If it wasn't raining... I think it's all because of the rain too. And I can't stop. Yes, nature takes over. I just lost control. You have problems with control too? It's funny... control's hardest the first time. It all happens so quickly. They say it's because of the fear of castration. I never knew that. And holding back is very hard. Very! And if it's raining too... no way! I thought I was the only one. No! There's loads of us! I've tried everything. Holding it with my finger, and thinking of nasty images. It's not much help. Really? Even rivers of blood, all these horrors, it's no help. Have you tried this? No. And this? No. I like it. Bit old fashioned, of course, but very sharp sensation. Forgive the pun. I've never gone quite that far. You should try it... try! The headache disappears and this clarity comes. As if the rain has stopped... And the voices... die out... die out... die out... Well, you know what I mean? - What're you scumbags planning to do? - Same as you - have some fun. Hey, maybe we should just go our separate ways? Listen, no one does that. You started, I joined in. Got something against that? I... no, nothing. Just her husband... He could come here. So we'll lock the door. - What're you doing? - Checking if we can get out of there? There are bars on all the windows... but we can go out the door. What're you worried about - we'll make a deal, and he'll keep quiet. - That's not what he wants... - Well, shouldn't have got his hopes up - we'll have to disappoint him. You don't get it? What don't I get, Mr. Philosopher? That we get caught? Handcuffs, a knife... Handcuffs? Loads of people use them. True, I don't know what the knife's for. He uses the bloody knife to carve up his victims. - Who? - Him. The maniac. What maniac? - What're you doing? - Phoning the police. I have to warn them. What, are you stupid? - My husband's worse than any maniac. - But it's our last chance! - You raped me! - What!? Yes. That's what I'll have to tell my husband. - But it's not true. - But it sounds true. I didn't rape you. It was raining. I ran into the shop. The salesman was alone. I didn't know that salesman. He jumped on me and raped me. And then another psycho came, and then they both... You hear that... Yes. I'm telling you - he's a total psycho. I've seen his victims - they've all had their innards turned inside out, and handcuff marks on their hands. He puts handcuffs on them, and then takes their entrails out. - He likes it, get it? - And where have you seen it? An inspector came. He showed me photographs. They're looking for him. You know what... - He used to work in the meat department. - Yes. But they moved him. You know why? No. He hacked up the meat. He didn't just cut it... he hacked it up... Here I am! - You took your time, man. - I did my best. We're missing something. I'll just bring it. Wait... Can I start? - You want to start? - I can't wait! Alright, man. Start... - Just leave me some. - Don't worry - I'm a professional! Closed. We're closed. Listen... It says 24 hours up there. Letters this big... - Can I have some water? - There. - Anything else? - The change. - I'm a regular customer here, you know. - Great. Two bottles of "Barrel." Light. Not too cold, please. It's not cold. The cold is in the fridge. - Got any bags? - No. I see. Come in. I just started. - Put the bat down. - Silence! Put it down, I said - he died. - What do you mean, died? - Like anyone dies. - That's just great! - Mm... Come on! Where's the key? Don't bother, it's not there. Where is it? - He swallowed it. - What! He swallowed it. - That's a joke, right? - No. I'm being serious. - Hang on... What did he die of? - A heart attack. - How do you know? - The same happened with my first husband. - What were you doing? - Nothing special. We were just chatting... - Just chatting? - Yes. What do you say to a maniac-killer to give him a heart attack? What? - You're getting really tiresome! - I just want to understand. I almost convinced him to give me the key. He put it in his mouth and said - take it. That was my chance! What would you have done in such a situation? Take it with my free hand. - Aha... - No, really. We started kissing, and he wasn't a bad kisser, and my hand accidentally went down... What for? I said "accidentally." Are you an idiot? You don't understand the word "accidentally"? Alright, then what? Then he started to choke, he grabbed at his heart and swallowed the key. But why did he have a heart attack? Why? I don't know. He just looked at my face. How do I know what he didn't like about it? What's there not to like? Well, maybe... disappointed? Disappointed? Well, his dick was... well, it turned out that, it wasn't very... And now what do I do? Whatever you want, or there's going to be another corpse here. And your husband will let you off? Hug you and caress your head? He'll caress me somewhere else. And unlike you, at least I've got a chance. Raining cats and dogs out there. Mind if I dry out here a bit? - Seen anything suspicious? - No. Everything's as usual. - Studying? - I have to. Retaking my exams. Really? How's it going? Alright. It's boring here. That's the job. There's something to do at nights too. Everyone has their own worries. Yes. What are yours? The maniac? He's round here somewhere. I can feel him. You mean to say that maybe right now... Of course. He's put the cuffs on... he's turning out someone's innards. You talk about it so calmly. Routine for the job. And there's nothing you can do about it? Yes there is. You know what I'll do if I catch him? - What? - I won't arrest him. - What will you do with him? - Give him justice on the spot. - You'd... - Precisely. Why arrest him when they'll probably declare him insane and give him treatment? - You think they'll cure him? - I don't think so. Neither do I. They proclaim them psychos, lock 'em in hospitals for a while, and then let them go. Yes, happens all the time. They say it's a lack of funds. - But that's not the real reason. - What is? The thing is, no one gives a damn. They don't care about psychos, druggies, maniacs, kiddy freaks. Don't give a damn about that. - You know why? - No. - Have you heard of the word 'mentality'? - Yes. - Do you know what it means? - Yes. No, in our case, it means just one thing - no one gives a damn. And however much you pay our people, absolutely nothing changes. They just won't give a damn! That's the way our people are! Yes, you're probably right. Hopeless. Anyway, the rain's died down. I can feel his time's coming. I'll be off... - What're you going to do? - Free you. - You want to break the lock with an axe? - No. The handcuff. What if you cut my hand off? My husband's waiting for me at the casino. I know, but how do I get a key? From him. - But he's dead. - Yes... - What're you saying? - That we don't have any other choice. Have you ever skinned a chicken? Oh my God! You've gone totally mad! Come on, it's easier than you think. Do it yourself then. - Right - with one hand? - Even if I had three hands... - What, you didn't lock the door again? - I can't keep it locked. I'd loose my job. Keep quiet. What's the axe for? Just in case. I'm on my own. Who knows what can happen? Good thinking. They're looking for some maniac. They stopped me three times. I've heard. They warned me. - Who? - An investigator came in. He showed me photographs. - All quiet here? - Yes. I'm reading a book in there. Studying then? - Did my wife come in? - No. I'll go and take a leak. Right, I'm off. Keep an eye out. And don't lock the shop. - Take his shirt off. - What? Take his shirt off. I'm just working up to it for now. I might not do it at all. You got any other ideas on how to get the key? What're you doing? - Maybe it'll fall out. - Yeah, right... This is what they do with drowned people. I'm telling you - there's no other way. Pull yourself together! Easier said than done. You think there will be a lot of blood? No idea. But you'd better know - I can't stand the sight of blood. I might faint. - He's got a hairy chest... - Does that make a difference? Listen, I'm a little nervous here... Come on, pull yourself together! Go on... Go on! I'm working where his stomach is! Take the knife... Cut him. We're closed. Help me out, man. There's the sign. We're closed. I need a bottle of vodka. I understand. Closed for technical reasons. The cash register doesn't work. - Come on - be a pal! - I can't be a pal. I'm a salesman! But I'll die. When you come round, I don't want you screaming again. I need you to keep quiet. Then I'll untie you, right? You're covered in blood, mate. - Cutting meat? - Yes. - Fresh? - Yes. I would take some fresh meat. My fridge's empty. - You'll cut me some? - Of course. Go on, I'll guard the shop. - How much? - A kilo. No, one and a half. I'll fry some up and make cutlets with the rest. I'm a bachelor. It's the job... Quiet! Quiet. I'll untie you soon. Quiet! Don't worry, I just need a little fresh meat, he won't mind. I'll explain later. Shut up! Just relax! Hold on! Keep still! I just need a kilogram and a half... I forgot to ask - what part should I cut you? I don't care, as long as it's not pork. I don't eat pork. I'm sorry to disappoint you, but we've only got pork. - Beef? - No. Only pork. It's a pity. I don't eat pork. I'm not a believer, but I understand and respect your religious beliefs. - What's religion got to do with it? - Well, you're Jewish, aren't you? No. - Muslim? - No. - They don't eat pork either? - No. I had no idea. I don't know about them, but I've got a serious reason not to eat pork. A pig once saved my life. Really? I was five years old. Spending a summer in the country. One day I fell into a pit far from the village. In the middle of nowhere. While falling, I broke my leg. I shouted for ages, called for help. I was exhausted. They wouldn't find me for half a year... well, whatever was left of me... - They'd have missed you by evening. - That's the point - they wouldn't have! Why not? Because nobody gives a damn about anything! What happened? How did you get out? In the village they'd decided to slaughter a pig. But it was a quick, crafty pig. It broke free and ran for it. The whole village was looking many hours for the pig, and it fell into my pit. So they found me. Amazing. Yes, ever since, I don't eat pork. That's how a pig saved my life. Then what happened? They got me out, my leg got better. - No - I mean, to the pig? - Oh, they ate it. Shame. - Strange... - What's strange? A pig saved my life once too. Me and my girlfriend's, actually. - Really? - Really. My parents didn't want us to marry. So we decided to die like Romeo and Juliet. From hunger. First we starved for a week. Then we realized it was too tortuous and slow, so we decided on gas. - You know how? - I know. It's quick, the body's well-preserved. You just fall asleep, and that's it. A beautiful death? And? We decided to eat before our deaths. A sort of last wish. I was for sex, of course, but my girlfriend insisted on food. It was a huge piece of fatty pork. We fried it and ate it. That's how a pig saved us. You ate it and changed your mind? No. We got the runs. Couldn't get off the john for the whole day. We were taking turns. You know how it is when you need to, but it's occupied. Won't wish it on the enemy. We haven't eaten pork since then. That's not the same. There's no comparison. I'm off. You just keep a look out. Easy, easy... I had to do it, so you wouldn't cry out. I had no choice. I'll untie you, but promise me you won't cry out. You promise? Alright, but I have to warn you - I didn't find the key. You've calmed down? Won't scream? Then I'll take the scotch off. - You're dead. - I know. Untie my hands. Where's the key? Wasn't in his stomach. That's for sure. - Where, then? - Maybe it went further? Where to? His innards. Why didn't you take a look? You know, I'm not an anatomical pathologist. I sell vodka to alkies in your husband's shop. Anyway, it was your idea to disembowel him. But he swallowed it. - Are you sure? - Yes. I felt it in his mouth with my tongue. He licked it. - Licked it? - Yes. We were both licking it. I missed grabbing it by seconds. His whole body shook, but the key didn't fall out. That bloody key could have fallen anywhere. Inside him. If you want, then look for it yourself. - What are you suggesting? - Same as before. To unhook him from you. And what will I do with this? The locksmith workshop opens at nine. What's that for? Wrappers soak up the blood. Then we'll take them out to the country and burn them. - What about him? - We'll take him and burn him too. How'll we take him? Like everyone else does - in the trunk of the car. - Who else? - Don't you watch television? - They all do it like that. - And the shop? We'll have to close it. My husband won't like it. You ready? - You won't miss? - Hope so. - What's that? - His hair. It came unstuck. You know, he looks better without a wig. We worked so long together. And I didn't know him at all... You've cleaned up well. - You said he swallowed the key. - Don't start... - But you told me. - Don't start! It just fell into his boot. Alright, stop whining and clean yourself up. And I'd better be off. What, you want to leave me here? Yes. You'll manage. Just throw him out into the street. Another victim of the maniac. Wait... Listen, I have no time. I've got to go to Casanova for sleeping pills. I need to get my sleep. I'll throw the body out. Maybe it will pass as another victim. But what about these? - Throw 'em out too. - Where? - In the garbage. - They'll probably check them. You have to take it and burn it. You've no choice. - That's why? - Because you're my accomplice. What? That's what I'll have to tell the police. Bad joke. It was your idea to poke around in his stomach. And you've got nothing to do with it? I just obeyed your every wish. You're the boss's wife. I'm the night salesman. I'm a nobody. I get an order, I carry it out. Why're you all wet? I went into the street. Why? I thought someone threw a stone at the window. And? Went around the shop - no one. It happens. You imagine some funny things. Sorry, have you got a toilet? Sure. Would you show me where? I don't want to get the dick out in the rain. It's cold - I don't want trouble with my prostate. Of course, come on... - Come on. - Come on, come on. Yes? Hell! The radio doesn't work - got wet, and the guys are wet. But we're in good spirits. We've still got our deal. - Didn't catch him yet? - No. But this is our night. I can feel it inside me. - Accounting room. - The toilet's further on. Yes. They won't give me any pay here. Would you take it? What deal were you talking about? - Just between us? - Of course. When we catch him, there'll be no court case, no investigation, no lawyers-for-sale. That's what the guys decided. Justice on the spot - remember, I told you. - Well, you're on our side. - But how? - During his escape attempt. - But if he wants to give himself up? We'll shoot him during his escape attempt. Even if he turns out to be your friend? Even if he turns out to be my brother. - You'd shoot your own brother? - I'd be doing him a favor. What about double checking? And if you catch the criminal at the scene of the crime? The main thing is not to delay... Thanks, pal! Come in, I just started. Open? We are all heroes From movies about war Or about the first flight to the moon Or about the life of lonely hearts Every movie has its own ending No pity for no one Not for you, not for me, not for him No pity for no one Not for you, not for me, not for him Out of cigarettes. Smoked two packs in one night. How're the studies going? Getting there? Slowly but surely... I see you're making headway. It was a very tricky chapter. Should be easier now. - What about you? How's the maniac? - We've almost got him. - Who is he then? - We don't know yet. But believe me - one hour or so, and it'll all be over. - Justice on the spot? - Definitely. We've found another victim. Not far from here, by the school. He really ripped the poor guy apart this time... As if he was looking for something. - Maybe it wasn't him? - It was him. It's his satanic signature. His bowels inside out. Handcuff marks on the hands. His style. An awful picture. And did he... you know... - What? - Rape him? Maybe, maybe not. What's the difference? Additional evidence, maybe... Come on, no one care about the victim. There's no way he's coming back to life. But the ripper's close by. It has to be stopped. He won't get away this time. We're just waiting now... Waiting for what? The dogs. Dogs? From headquarters. They've got great dogs. Dobermans. They're coached to pick up the trail and tear the criminal to pieces. Nobody's escaped them so far... But are you sure they can pick up the trail? Of course... The scent! The scent's still there! Only rain can wash it away. Only an hour or so has passed. The dogs will find the trail easily. And then it's all over! Pal... That work's bad for you. You study too hard. Bad for the body. Mark my words. I've got to go. Look after yourself, friend. - God, what's that smell? - We're poisoning cockroaches. - In the morning? - Best time for it. - With that? - Yes. It's got mosquitoes on it. We're poisoning the mosquitoes too. They're at their weakest this hour. And people die more often in the mornings... Heavens! What can I get you? Two packs of "Belomor." Thank you. Don't know anything about dogs, do you? Actually, I'm a dog trainer. Really? No, seriously? Know more about them, than about people. People are a mystery to me. You know, I'm no Dostoevsky. - My girlfriend and I want a dog. - What breed? - A Doberman. - That's a great dog. I wanted to ask - what's their sense of smell like? Well, son, it's an attack breed, so don't go thinking it will bring your slippers. But I've heard they train their sense of smell, in the special services, I think. If a trained Doberman takes the scent, it'll catch its prey. Great... What could stop it? Is it easy to knock it off the scent? Well, you can knock it off, sure, but she'll still find it. But if the scent disappeared altogether... - How? - If it started raining, for instance... - Arghh, what's tha smell? - I poisoned the cockroaches. - We've got cockroaches? - Yes. They got in from somewhere. Put a bottle of vodka on my account, and give me a glass. - Not having any? - I don't drink. You mean, not while working... or not at all? - Not at all. - Good... You start drinking, then you get married... Or is it the other way round? First you get married, then you start drinking. Probably the other way round. - My wife didn't come? - No. Bitch, waited all night at the casino for her. And it's been raining buckets... It's all because of the rain. And Casanova got sick. - You said Casanova? - Yes. That's what they call him. Who - everyone? Well, everyone... in this shop. - Why? - I don't know. Not my idea. Sick, you say? I'll visit him. Lord, where is your justice? Lord... You open? I thought something happened to you. No, just tired. I studied a lot. - Well, good luck. - Thank you... The time in Moscow is eight a.m. And now, a news report. - Hi, how are you? - Fine. Oil prices continue to rise. The new-born albino panda at the Beijing Zoo has a clean bill of health. The city authorities have admitted that there's a serial killer loose in the eastern region of our city. A photo-portrait is being put together. The law enforcement agencies believe they may have the criminal's DNA. Now, more detailed reports, and other news... Always the same, damn it, every day. You need a partner? - You want to change your life again? - Yes, something like that. I do need a partner... at night, out on the road, there are so many maniacs... Watering machines, heavy beer bottle, Chipped cigarettes, cerebellar disorders, Desperate strange women, meaningless conversations, Smeared makeup, puzzled faces, Tracks of yesterday's fun are scattered on the asphalt, One day of life is killed again, a cold rain instead of a shower, Key doesn't fit the door of my house, you are my love to the grave, You're dissatisfied with something again, shit hit the fan, I won't... I won't return... I won't... I won't return...
