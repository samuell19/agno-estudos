There is something about the music of Bach that does transcend, and it really makes you feel alive and it sort of tells you about life, and about the world, in a way that nothing else can. One of the most amazing things about Bach's music is how it has reverberated everywhere, and over time, and through different cultures. It's almost impossible to imagine a world in which Bach had not been born, because so many other people have been affected in such profound ways by his music. There's such a humanity to Bach, and every possible human emotion from joy and humor and laughter to sorrow and loss, and it somehow reaches to the heart of human nature. I'm surprised when you hear this music that you just don't really let yourself go. I think Bach understood that. It's so uplifting. I mean, it is a dance. My love for Bach and my feelings that I have are as close to religion as I get. I would say his music is kind of cosmic. You know, if you go and you lie down in the country at night and you look up at the stars, and you don't know what any of it means, and you're just looking at this huge vista, I would say that his music is like that. I always felt an affinity with Bach's solo violin music, and his use of chromaticism and his invention of line within harmony is really very imaginative, and I wonder how it was perceived in his time. It just absolutely slams you in the heart or gut, or whatever it is. Bach has that sort of immediacy. It's music that fires on all cylinders. He represents this sort of standard of perfection. The music of Bach represents a sense of cosmic harmony, a sense of oneness with the universe. I can't help but think that he has lifted all of us up onto a higher spiritual plane, along with his own striving toward that plane. When I play Bach, I occasionally will open my eyes, and see that the majority of people that are listening have their eyes closed. They're feeling a special place that Bach really epitomizes. With Bach, every single thing I listened to and was attracted to, it just fit. Then I started to think, "Wow, there's a place for the banjo in this kind of music." I don't think you can find a composer who isn't deeply moved, and hasn't been deeply affected by Bach's music. It's just ... It can't happen. And that's astonishing. It's hard to fathom an artist in any other field having had such an impact. Bach articulated the language of music in the most complete and richest and complex form that any single person has ever been able to do. Skip back three hundred years in time to when Bach was around. Music was the technological vortex of the day, with things like the organ and the evolution of instruments going through all sorts of changes. And the biggest star in the musical world was Bach. The king of organ playing, and as such, probably knew more about the instrument than anybody else. You have to remember, the organ in baroque Germany was by far the most complex machine that civilization had come up with to that point. One of the problems with organs is that they're so damn complicated that they were always falling apart. And so, if you were an organist in those days, you had to know how to fix them. And so Bach was in the thick of things in terms of design and construction of these instruments. Bach was helping his great-uncle Christoph to maintain the instrument and so on. On the one side he was a great help to his great-uncle, but on the other side he was also able to learn and to become an organ technician himself. I think you could almost compare Bach a little bit like a computer geek these days. I mean, he really knew his stuff. The D Major Fugue is one of my personal favorite fugues. It is just full of youth and freshness and exuberance. It is quite literally a dance. Bach wasn't geographically all that well traveled but he soaked up every piece of music he could find, and when he did get a chance to boondoggle off and hang out with people like Buxtehude, he picked up every trick that he could. He was like a vacuum cleaner for this stuff, and, so naturally, when he came back and played, he would synthesize all these new impressions that he had, and take interesting ideas from wherever he could find them. And because he was such a commanding performer, especially on the organ, he tried crazy, just blisteringly complex things, that must have really stunned people. When Bach was 23, which is right around my age as a matter of fact, he was appointed court organist in Weimar. And to get such a great appointment, such a big appointment at such a young age, was quite an achievement. And that was actually when he wrote a big part of all his organ works. And the D Major Fugue, as a matter of fact, it's very likely that it was composed during that time. And the organ was really the instrument that inspired Bach to be a composer. Improvisation is a major element of the work of an organist, and Bach wanted to try out all kinds of new things, and I think most of the organ works originated, actually, as improvisations that were written up at a later point. So, improvisation is a very important element also in Bach's compositional process, and this kind of experience stayed with Bach throughout his life. Improvisation has been key, the main driving force, the main way I've made music all my life. It's like Papa Bach handed that to me. "Make Penny Lane a gigue!" In Bach's time, and probably before, and certainly thereafter, but not now, improvisation was a huge part of a musical life, a huge part of a musical education. In the recording of Bach Meets the Beatles, they really were improvs. I knew what songs I was going to do, and I knew the mood that I was going to create with them. In Bach's period and Mozart, the cadenzas in concertos, they didn't write those out! They did them differently every night. And that was, if you will, the American Idol moment. That's when the stars were born, when they would show off. They would show their command of the keyboard, and be able to smoke, if you will, at the keys. Just ... amazing stuff coming out. I've been challenged today by a young man named Anatoly Larkin. We're going to give it our best shot. In the Baroque period in the time of Bach, events were staged. They were happenings. Spontaneous, combustible moments, if you will, where keyboard players, organists, harpsichordists would duel. And these contests were the reality moments in that period where they would get together and see who would outdo the other. During improvisation you have to think on your feet. You discover new things, and over time you build almost an intuition about what the other person is thinking, and those are the magical moments. Off we go and soon we are in completely uncharted territory. We modulate keys, and end with this really Rachmaninoff-Liszt-like fanfare. I remember reading a story, this famous story, of Bach and his competitor. He had been challenged, Bach had been challenged, to a duel, if you will, to improvise. And each contestant was given a period to warm up. The one who was challenging was this French keyboard player named Marchand. He goes to the site, Marchand goes to the site, and he, I can just see it, he peers in, and leans his ear in, to the sanctuary where the organ was, and he listens to Bach warming up. It's more than he could bear. He bolted. He bailed. He left town. And all the public was there to see this, and what did Bach do? He did this big six-hour improvisation marathon. I would have loved to have been there. In classical music where you already know the answers before you even begin the piece, you know what the answer is. Improv is you're questioning all the way through. You're constantly asking yourself, "how does this go, where does this go, "why does this go?" And not necessarily in my compositions, but being an improviser, I know that I do travel in the Bachian sort of style and world. I've got to tell you a story about the Bach Violin Concerto in A Minor. I sang the entire concerto with members of the San Francisco Symphony standing behind me in a semi-circle. And in the second movement, I got completely turned around and lost. And the musicians were playing, and you could see it in their eyes, "Are we going to stop? Are we going to stop, are we going to start over again?" And they were wondering what I was going to do. And so I improvised my way to a spot that I recognized, and then took it from there. And anyway, we finished the piece, and intermission comes, and I'm very embarrassed and sorry that I had put them through this experience. And I'm apologizing profusely to the players. I was a brand new conductor, and I had messed up and all that kind of stuff. But one of the women in the orchestra was this older woman and she came up to me and she looked at me and said, "Bach would have loved it!" And it was because I was improvising, I was just sort of making something up. I'll never forget that, I'll never forget that. But simply from the joy of music making, that's what I think is sort of missing, is this constant quest. And composers like Bach, I think, were always asking this question every time that they wrote. I think Bach understood that. I think he knew all of that. I think Bach's mind was huge. You know it's funny that the musicians that are revered in all the conservatories and music schools were absolutely fabulous improvisers. You know, Bach and Mozart and Beethoven. And it made it authentic and genuine. And I think a lot of times in classical performances, we forget that. You know, we get so locked up in technique and how it sounds, and playing the right notes. What people want to hear, they want to see the performer actually disappear into the music, so that all you hear is the music and not so much be enthralled with the performance but enthralled with the experience of the music making. You know I think that there's some similarities between Baroque music and Bach's music with jazz. The walking bass line, the figured bass, which sort of outlines chords but allows the keyboard player to fill in the harmony the way they want to do that. I always thought in my own mind, as a jazz musician, that Bach sort of had his own place in music history, in the sense that there was a lot of things you could learn from him as a musician, especially how his harmony moves, and how the intricacies of the counterpoint that he's setting up, how he writes fugues, all those things. And if you love something, and you study it, and you bring to it a seriousness of purpose but also a sense of fun, a sense of the joy of playing music in a way that's real. It's not something that's heavy-handed but something that's natural. You know, maybe you can bring a different point of view to how you're playing. For me, it's totally selfish. I just love playing the music. Well, the whole point was that we use our voice instrumentally. And that is the essential description of the Swingle Singers. Fine. That's good, except that - It was, I think, new. People hadn't scatted Bach before that. The singers that were in that first group were instrumentalists who sang. We were ad hoc singers in the recording world in Paris, and that kept us alive because we spent a good two years preparing that first recording. And we would never have thought that it would have had the success that it did. That's very good, people! We did have certain guidelines. We just basically made it as simple as possible, so as not to get in the way of Bach's counterpoint, and that was quite sufficient because Bach took care of everything else. The Badinerie came from one of the orchestral suites, and I suddenly saw that melody going, and I could hear Christiane Legrand singing it. A tempo! But it was extremely sing-able. It's a jovial piece. And one can't so much accuse Bach of being jovial. I think he undoubtedly had a good sense of humor. There are a lot of little traces of that in his work. I think I do it vocally, rather than with scat. Ah. Can I hear it? Yeah. That 'ya dah'. I kind of like that. It's a little quaver. There is every emotion imaginable in Bach's musical creations. And you do wonder how he was able to get so high, such high emotivity, at the same time such incredibly complex, but yet exacting, musical writing. That's, I would say, a puzzle. It's a mystery... and "vive le mystère" as they say in France. Bach was one of the great improvisers. He must have been a kind of fountain. You have never the idea of effort with Bach. In the jazz context, I hear the great improvisers, and you realize what an extraordinary feat it is. Well, Bach, I think, did that, thinking about something else, and the notes just came to him in some miraculous way. But, no, it is fascinating, how often I would almost dream about having the idea to explore Bach's mind. I think they're doing some very, very interesting neurological studies these days, on, for example, improvisation. What happens to a musician when he improvises? What is that particular click that gives him the material to improvise? This business of the brain being influenced and developed somehow in improvisation is quite mind-boggling. Just a few months ago I was on the road with my dad. He gives me this piece of paper, this newspaper, from USA Today, and it said, "Scientist has developed brain scan for improvisation," or something like that. And I never envisioned that I would end up on that table in Dr. Limb's MRI study. Okay, John. Now we're going to record you improvising. We're going to be recording all of the notes that are coming out of your keyboard and we want you to basically play whatever improvisation you like on that Bach melody. And feel free to start when you like. What I found amazing was, here you're lying in this cylindrical confined space, but when you look up, he's invented this mirror. And you can literally see what notes you're playing, and it's like you were looking at it directly. And then after, what was even more fascinating, in a sense, was that he had printed out, or had on a computer screen, the notes that I had actually played. That was quite wonderful. That was great, John. I think we got exactly what we need. - How are you? - Good. Now this portion of the brain during improvisation shows areas that are kind of cool spots as opposed to this hot spot, and those cool spots are areas that are going down in activity, that are basically kind of turning off. I always really gravitated towards music, and I took piano lessons. That was my first sort of formal instrument. I always remember a time when I was learning music. As a child learning piano with the Suzuki method, which is what I learned, Bach and music are the same at that level. The Minuet in G, one of the first things I ever learned when I was a child, like 5 years old. So what you can see here, John, on the screen, is brain images that correspond to blood flow during regular memorized piano playing. So, for example, when you're playing something that you've really learned and internalized, and you're not improvising at all, but you're just doing the act of playing the piano, these are the areas that we found to be active during our study. And they correspond really to things related to sensory processing. Here you can see your auditory cortexes light up, and motor cortexes light up, and those are the things that are involved physically in the act of playing the piano, because you have to be able to hear it, and you have to be able to move your fingers, and play what you want. Now if we look at this brain scan here, This shows us differences that take place during improvisation, in comparison to memorized or pre-learned music. If you look at the combination of things in the pre-frontal cortex, we found that the area responsible for self-expression went up, whereas those areas that inhibit out-flow went down. So, in a way, you were turning off the sensor, and trying to promote the novel flow of new ideas. You know, in some ways, this whole dis-inhibition that we're seeing in lateral areas actually has to do with letting go. I think really shutting down everything that kind of keeps you in the here and now, in the present tense, and takes you to some other altered state of consciousness. Whether it's sort of a transcendent musical experience you had in the past that is so deeply internalized that you can kind of get there again mentally. - Travel there instantly. - Exactly. And I think, I hope, that what we're seeing here is the neural underpinnings of what is sort of a magical musical process. I don't ever remember a time when I could conceive of knowing music without knowing of the music of Bach. In Bach's day, when he was at the keyboard improvising, he probably entered a very similar, very analogous, neural state of activity where his front of the brain regions were highly active, and his filtering mechanisms were off. I really, truly think that that likely took place. It's become very remarkable to me that I have been able to take musical questions and medical questions, and really try to merge the two, and use what I've learned in a creative way to try to solve problems pertaining to what I view as the greatest mystery, and that's music and how the brain accomplishes music. Well, there you go! It's amazing what you can do with a 35-plastic piano keyboard... - ... on your back. - Thirty five! And two notes! When I was asked why I was going to do the Chromatic Fantasy, because it's originally for keyboard, I said, "Well, what I can bring to it is breath." It's a kind of singing improvisation and journey. In the case of Bach, of course, your space speaks to you, and starts to resonate, especially in the environment of the church and this kind of acoustic. To be swirling and somehow improvised, and the sounds keep moving around. I was also aware that I could play very, very, very quietly, and still have the sound sustain itself. To be secretive, to be almost inaudible, and yet feel a nurturing of your sound. Part of Bach's earthiness was in the use of chromaticism, in the use of the unexpected turn in the chord progression, or a leading voice that took you in another direction. Bach took the twelve notes and treated them all very personally, and with great honesty, wonder and discovery. If you think about the quantity of music that he composed, we can't really talk about composition in the normal sense. I think basically what Bach wrote down was what he heard. I don't think he ever composed anything. I think pieces arrived in his mind complete. There's no other way to explain the massive amount of music he wrote. When we talk about composition, I wouldn't say that he really composed in any way that you and I would think about composition, where you had to think about the structure, and wonder what was going to happen next. I think, for example, the fugues, it seems, when I listen to them, it sounds to me, he was - he just heard them and he wrote them down. When you say how can someone have done this, we're talking about a genius. We're talking now, what do we mean by that? We mean that in the way we talk about how did Einstein think of the theory of relativity. Well, he was a genius. How did he think of it? He says that he visualized it, and then he spent years trying to develop the mathematics to describe what he saw. Bach was given a beautiful system of notation that had developed over a number of years. He could go from the auditory vision to the notation without any process. He could hear it that way. What's staggering about this is that works of that complexity could have been visualized with such clarity. Bach articulated the language of music in the most complete and richest and complex form that any single person has ever been able to do. When you come across people like Michelangelo or Einstein or Bach, men of tremendous artistic or scientific vision, what's inspiring about them is that in fact they're human beings, like us, and yet they've realized a potential that we haven't. To me it's a great inspiration that human beings are capable of that, and we are related to them without any question. We're a part of them, they're a part of us, and they're the best of us, and we can see it. They've articulated it. And they probably don't know very much more about it than we do. The Goldberg Variations to me represents sort of Bach's summing up of all the musical interests that he had in his life. He's putting in all the different techniques, all the different national musics, the humor, the pathos. And also his sense of unity. In other words, this idea that all these pieces, in all their various manifestations, are all derived from the same harmonic grid. It's an amazing achievement. If you look at Goldberg Variations, it's sort of Bach trying at the end of his life to include his musical universe in this one piece. You know that's really sort of the message that I'm getting from Bach, that there's the universal aspect of wanting to embrace a lot of different types of music, but doing it with a lot of different techniques, not just with your head, but with your heart. It contains the universe. Glenn Gould's "The Goldberg Variations" had an enormous effect on me. I think that I listened to that music exclusively for at least two months, because I was astounded at the colors and the dynamics and the phrasing that he had, and created, and brought to that piece. I had never, never heard that piece played that way. And that Aria at the beginning. I was so moved by the melody. Whatever the proper view of Bach playing in the Fifties was, Glenn Gould turned it all around. This was a strutting Bach. This was a sort of sexy, out there, very physical Bach. It was something new, and a lot of people, I think, were quite suspicious of it. But there were those who understood and those who heard. It just astonishes me how many people - still - are finding in Glenn Gould something that means something very specific, and very personal to them. People who weren't ever born when Glenn died. When you heard Glenn play, there was something that really just leaped out. There was so much rhythmic propulsion in how he was playing. The very sort of - for many people, I'm sure - strange choices. He played in a very percussive way. But the voice-leading - you could hear how all the voices were moving. He had incredible control of the counterpoint as a pianist, and when I heard that, it really floored me, and I became obsessed with those records. And those recordings had a profound effect, I think, on a lot of musicians. Glenn Gould. I listen to his Goldberg Variations very very often. Just absolutely floored by the way that he approaches Bach with exactitude, and yet the emotion that he gets, quality of the playing, quality of the recording, all of that is perfection. There was no avoiding the fact, when listening to Glenn Gould, that all of those neural circuits were firing constantly. This was a brilliant man who had a profound understanding, not only of the music of Bach, but of many other composers. Gould was a huge influence on me, but maybe more in an abstract kind of way. Not that I'm trying to emulate how he plays. What I was influenced by was the fact that he had such a strong vision, and wasn't frightened by anyone, and just followed what he thought was important in the music, and what his personal vision of this music was. We took to each other immediately, and by the end of our first phone conversation, which was a rather epic phone conversation, we were already on the way to building a friendship. He'd usually call around eleven o'clock at night. And you had the sense that this was a rather lonely man, and somebody who really really wanted to connect to the world. I actually only met him in person about a month or so before he died. Here he was, this man in this heavy coat in August, no laces in his shoes, and he looked as though he wore his clothes for a month at a time. I remember walking through the halls of The Inn on the Park, and some little boy looked at him, and started to walk over to him, and his horrified mother grabbed him and pulled him back. I'm sure that child never knew, and certainly his mother never knew, that they'd just had an encounter with one of the greatest musical geniuses of the Twentieth Century. Glenn and I started talking about the new recording of the Goldberg Variations and I had listened to it, and I just flipped out. I thought it was wonderful. From the very beginning I thought that it improved upon the 1955 performance, that it was much deeper, much more thoughtful. It was really a sense of a summing up, and I felt that actually listening to it before I knew that Glenn Gould was going to die the week that it was released, which made it very eerie, since he had started his career with the Goldberg Variations, and then in the same way that the Goldberg Variations comes back to the theme to complete, Glenn went back and re-recorded the Goldberg Variations. Glenn was well aware that the singing on his recordings was a real problem. But he was honest enough with himself to realize that something in him needed that. Glenn was in sort of an ecstatic transport. I mean this is somebody who was just absolutely in a state of his own. Deeply deeply emotionally involved. Glenn would have loved nothing better than to give live concerts without having to be there. And we make that possible. What we've done is we've taken soundwaves and we've converted them back into a description of how the musician played that day it was recorded. We're in the business of discovering how every note was played. We're looking at micro-timings and micro-pressures, and every pedal had to be carefully preserved, and a fair amount of programming and all the hardware technology. The very precise way that humans play. I think that Glenn would have loved this idea. John Walker is very definitely on to something with the idea of taking old recordings and reproducing them on this wonderful special version of the Yamaha Disklavier. This piano is controlled by solenoids. It can actually play a file, a computer file, and the quality is so important in what we do. The fact that we need to reproduce performance with utmost fidelity to the original performance. Gould recorded the entire Goldberg Variations without the Aria. He got all the way to the end, and then did 23 takes of that first Aria. And even after 23 takes, he couldn't get it from beginning to end, and had to do a splice. Overall I am very happy with the project, and the fact that in the end, people who really knew Gould would come up to us and say thank you so much for making this possible, for me to be able to hear Glenn's performance live again. Yes, we all know of Bach's interest in numbers, and the fact that he didn't just think of himself as a musician but almost a scientist. And there are important number relationships in quite a few of his works. It's an interesting way in which it connects again with what we do here at Zenph, and that is we ultimately need to use numbers to recreate performances by, such as Glenn Gould, playing the Goldberg Variations, and the fact that every note can be codified as a number. As a young kid growing up in the Eighties, I loved playing computer games and actually keying characters into Basic on my first PC at the age of 6, and kind of was inspired in part by the computer music used in those games. One of the reactions that I got when I told people I was going to write a computer programme to compose in the style of Bach was that we might ruffle a few feathers with the idea that computers could create music. There were certainly a lot of questions at the beginning of whether this was even possible. And I released it in 1994. CPU Bach came about at an interesting time in my life. I'd just finished the computer game called Civilization, which turned out to be quite successful, and was the first really huge game that I created. And I was looking for, you know, "What am I going to do next?" The idea of CPU Bach is just a river of music, and was really intended to be something that you'd put in your living room and hook up to your television - a continual flow of music. We actually programmed the algorithm so that it could compose just as fast as it played the music. When I was a kid, I learned the violin and I played the Bach Double Concerto. And the music was so different and so rich and deep from anything else that I had played that I had to understand who wrote this music, and how did this person create this great music. And I think that really started a lifelong interest in Bach. We're coming to more and more accept a confluence of art and technology. And CPU Bach, I think, was one of the first steps, really, in creating that overlap between technology and art. This generation has grown up with computers and interactivity and gaming. And to use that technology to introduce them to something like the music of Bach could be really exciting. The Chaconne is definitely a journey and you feel it from the outset. You know you're in for something very powerful and amazing. Bach manages to take you through the entire range of human emotion through tragedy and discovery and longing, and joy and spirituality, ecstasy, and then resignation and redemption, and finally a sort of triumph, you might say. Bach's Chaconne is Bach's personal story. It's so easy to get overwhelmed by the music that people forget that behind it was an actual flesh-and-blood guy, who had, I think like a lot of geniuses, Bach had a life that was full of tragedy and full of joy. He had an incredibly vigorous and challenging life. If you look at some of the little data points: when he was just a little kid, when he was 9 years old, his mom died. And when you're 9 years old, you're just about old enough to know what that means. But when he was 10, his father died, and so suddenly Bach was an orphan, and he grew up in the care of his older brother, without a mom or a dad. That was kind of the beginning of Bach. And if you follow the threads of his career, when he was 18 or 19, he was a star organist and starting to get moving as a musician. And around that time he got to know Maria Barbara, and the two of them fell in love, and they got married when they were 22, and started having babies right away. And ... baby needs shoes, and Bach needed a job, and so he got a great job in Arnstadt as an organist. When he and Maria were 28, they had twins in February, and those two kids died within about three weeks of each other. And, yes, it was three hundred years ago, and, yes, infant mortality was more of a prevalence then, but it doesn't matter who you are. If you're 28 and you and your wife have just had twins and they die, it kills you. And there must be connections between these sorts of events in Bach's life and the music that was coming out. If you fast-forward ahead another ten years, when Bach was 35, he had to go on a business trip to test out an organ, I think. And while he was gone his beloved wife and mother of his seven kids died. By the time he got home she'd already been buried, and suddenly Bach was a widower with kids going down to about 2 years old, and no wife to look after them. The love of his life was gone, and he had to pick himself up, and still the music came gushing out. The career has changed again, he found a new woman eventually. But these were the kinds of big events that were going on in his life, and they're absolutely related to the music. I think when you listen to the music of Bach, you're overwhelmed by the emotional undercurrents that are packaged in this sort of baroque formal structure. And those emotions come from places that are very real, and very human. And it's a shame that we don't know more about what Bach's life was really like, but I'm certain that... that those great human moments were at the essence of the music that he wrote. Bach's music is filled with patterns. There are many ways to look at those patterns and see them, and I think that's a big part of what gives Bach's music its indestructible nature. When you look at all the difference pieces he wrote, he was a very pragmatic guy. He would take a violin partita and turn it into a couple of licks in an organ cantata. He would take a lute piece and arrange it for keyboard. So he was always shifting his scores from one instrument to another. You got music that was like DNA. It could hop from one animal to the next without too much trouble. One of the most amazing things about Bach's music is how it's reverberated everywhere. And it's why, a couple of hundred years later, Wendy Carlos can pick up a Bach piece and turn it into a best-seller by playing it on a Moog synthesizer, or why kids can tap it out on steel pans. It's because the music had that sort of lift away from the platform. And how much Bach would have really enjoyed hearing his music adapted that way on those instruments! The ukulele is the underdog of all instruments. And when you play it, it just makes you smile. One of the characteristics about Bach's music is that it's so perfect and every note has its place. Bach has so many of these really cool, just beautiful melodic lines that are happening. The notes just make so much sense. You know, it doesn't - It doesn't - Really, it doesn't matter what instrument you play. It's the most difficult music I've ever tackled, and then you think, "Okay, how am I going to do this?" It's this constant problem solving, when you're playing the ukulele. It really made me look at my fingerboard in a different way. Such a range of emotions runs through your body, run through your mind. You have to feel it inside of you. You have to be able to attach yourself to those notes, and these different feelings to it. And then when you play, all of that comes out, and that's what makes it magical. That's what moves people. When I moved to Nashville, a couple of years later Edgar Meyer became a friend of mine. And he would play some Bach, and I started to think, "Wow, I'd like to do that. "I'd like to play this kind of music. "There's a place for the banjo in this kind of music." So he opened up my understanding and my awareness of Bach. Edgar Meyer started playing all this Bach for us. That was a great thing for me when I realized that Edgar Meyer, who was already one of my heroes, was also a great Bach player. All of the folk guys now, mandolin players and banjo players, and guitarists, they're all playing a little bit of Bach. That was a lot of fun just trying to figure out how to make it happen on a bass. Because it does present a large number of very interesting technical challenges. Ah, now my hands are doing what they're supposed to. It just feels right. That's what I want to do with the bass. Now that's music. I am here to tell you, ain't nobody like Bach. Being around the music, listening to it, or playing it on the bass, or playing it on the piano, being involved with Bach's music in any way, really, I guess, probably gives me as much pleasure as any one thing that I can think of. Bach does sit in a central place. My father was excited about this music, and it was played on Sunday morning before we went to church. I can remember him. He would play a recording, some piece of music that he was particularly fond of, and he would look up and he would just say, "Now that's really - That's what it's all about." I think it was the center of his existence and I think I picked that up pretty directly, pretty honestly. With Bach, every single thing I listened to, and was attracted to, it just fit the banjo. So I had a sense of this inevitability to the whole thing, that the music was going to work on the banjo, and it would sound right. It's just amazing stuff. It wasn't until I actually started trying to learn a Bach piece that I started to realize how awesome this stuff was. There's a perfection to his lines and it's the way we all wish we improvised. So by playing them and getting that music in our hands and in our heads, it gives us the tools to strive for that goal, of this really intelligent high level improvising, which it feels like he must have been doing because I'm sure he was just sitting there writing it down from his head. He wrote so much stuff so fast that I think it was just pouring out of him. It was like turning on a faucet. And one of the real joys that I have is sitting with Edgar and having him pull out music, and finding one gem after another, after another, after another. It's like, "Holy cow!" Does it ever stop? I mean I don't even know if you could ever even hear all of his music. There's so much of it. Bluegrass sounds older than Bach, but when you hear Bach, it sounds modern and current, and eye-opening and surprising. I just know that I like it. I don't know what Coltrane's doing either, but I like it. And I figure I grab little chunks of it and pieces of it and internalize them and they become part of my vision, but I don't pretend to know what's really going on. I'm like a folk musician that got a little out of control. When I fell in love with Bach and heard this Gould recording, music that just fires on all cylinders, that has the immediacy and emotional intensity, that clarity of intent. I've never included the Bach in a set of mine and it not been the biggest moment of the night for everybody. And honestly, you play this music for them, and they freak out about it. People went crazy for it. And in the autograph line afterwards that was always what people said. "Wow, I love the Bach. I'm going to go listen to some Bach." It's something that people come to hear now. And these are not classical music fans. And Bach is one of those few things, one of the very few things in the world that I'd say, everyone, everyone exposed to it, in the right situation, or frame of mind is going to love it. I love a routine of Bach's was put the kids to bed and he would take a carafe of brandy, and go upstairs to his little closet, and write ... and write music. Candle, cognac, in that closet. And look at all the music we got from that. To me that's the picture... that's always in my mind, anytime I'm trying to be creative, or playing some Bach and trying to remember that Bach is hopefully not up in heaven right now looking down at me going, "What is this kid talking about? "What the hell is he doing to my music?" Hopefully he's actually up there with his carafe of brandy, and a candle is lit, and he's writing more music. That's how I would like to think of him. In a little tiny closet. One of the strongest examples of PDQ Bach's innovation, of his being years ahead of his time, years before Bill Monroe, he actually invented the bluegrass idiom in this cantata, Blaues Gras, the Bluegrass Cantata, and it's for bluegrass band and a baroque orchestra. He wrote for some extremely unusual things. PDQ Bach has a history of playing off the imbalance between certain instruments. For instance, the Pervertimento for Bicycle, Bagpipe and Balloons. I think the easiest way to describe PDQ Bach is that he was the twenty-first of Johann Sebastian Bach's twenty children, and certainly the oddest of the lot. PDQ Bach has been called a pimple on the face of music. And although he did follow the typical Bach pattern of going into music and becoming a composer, he did it in a very strange way, since he was a well-known plagiarizer. There are a lot of things he didn't write. Many Eighteenth Century composers occasionally borrowed a theme from one of their peers, but I think that PDQ Bach was the only composer who worked on tracing paper, and it shows up in his works. Well the three basic periods of PDQ Bach's creative life were the initial "Plunge", which he spent in Vienna, learning the basic rules of musical composition. Then came the "Soused", or "Brown Bag" period, by far the longest period of his life, which he spent in Wein-am-Rhein forgetting the basic rules of musical composition. And then the last period, Contrition, which he spent in the charming southern German town of Baden-Baden-Baden, trying to work off a monumental hangover, which the recent discovery of his skull indicates he may still have. Using the very sophisticated alcohol dating technique, it has been estimated that PDQ's last hangover has a half-life of about 245 years. Very touching. For me, the Bach cello suites and hearing the solo cello, it's somehow as close as one can get to how a human brain and heart work. In fact it was because of Bach that I started to rethink how I was presenting this music that I love so much. I've taken it to so many different kind of venues and different audiences, stripping away hundreds of years of concert hall tradition that really didn't have anything to do with Bach and the way his music was performed. So much of Bach was premiered in coffeehouses, and he even charged his employers for quite a few beers. I've actually played where these cello suites were first performed in Köthen. It's in Prince Leopold's castle, in this very small town in the eastern part of Germany. I could kind of imagine Prince Leopold and a select few of his friends, couples dancing, and others just having a conversation in the back. So really it's not unlike some of the experiences that I have on the road now, playing in clubs like the Iota, and other rock-and-roll clubs. When Bach got the gig as composer at Köthen, he turned into a major hit factory. The music that came gushing out is unbelievable. You have all of the Partitas for Solo Keyboard, the English Suites, the French Suites, the Brandenburg Concertos, all those things that kind of come in sixes, the violin pieces, the cello pieces. It's an unbelievable outpouring of incredibly imaginative music and catchy tunes. But you look at how much came out of this guy's pen in such a burst of a couple of years. It's unbelievable, and yet it's only one chunk of his output. He was so industrious throughout his whole career. Bach was one of the most versatile musicians who ever came along. He could play all the instruments that he wrote music for quite capably. He loved to sit in on the Brandenburg Concertos. His favorite thing was to play the viola line because he was sort of in the middle and weaving his contrapuntal melodies above and below the others. But he played all the keyboards. He played the flute. He knew intimately the instruments that he was writing for. So he was as versatile a musician as I think you could imagine. It's almost impossible to imagine a world in which Bach had not been born, because so many other people have been affected in such profound ways by his music. Chopin, whenever his kids came in for a lesson, Chopin always had the Well-Tempered Clavier on the piano because it was the first thing he played every day. Mozart took several Bach pieces from the Well-Tempered Clavier and arranged them for string quartet. Brahms and Busoni arranged the Chaconne. I don't think you can find a composer who isn't deeply moved, and hasn't been deeply affected the Bach's music. It's just... It can't happen. And that's astonishing. It's hard to fathom an artist in any other field having had such an impact. But you see it everywhere. I mean, Bach's music has reverberated off of every other musician that's worth his or her salt. I always felt an affinity with Bach's solo violin music. A lot of people forget, I think, that Bach was so active as a violinist, and he got his first job as a violinist. Bach, I find to be a very progressive composer, an active proponent of innovation. His use of chromaticism, and his invention of line within harmony is really very imaginative, and I wonder how it was perceived in his time. I think actually he was quite "out there". He was experimenting very much like someone like Schoenberg. Most people think of Schoenberg as an academic composer, as a method composer, but I don't think either of them intended to be methodical. I think they were writing what they felt, and I think they were giving themselves structures so that they would be even freer to write. And the pure emotional nature of both of their music is often quite overlooked. Sometimes the most mathematical seeming music is actually the most liberating to play because you have certain structures set out for you, you have the groundwork all clearly laid, and then you really have to be creative, you really have to invent something in your interpretation. I think technically Bach is definitely a touchstone because you can't get away with faking it. You really have to do it all the way. I have to phrase each voice separately. If there's one line that's not effective or not integral to the interpretation, it can really skew everything in the listener's ear, so it's tricky. But I have to think about these lines sort of converging and weaving in and out. It gives me a chance to dive beneath, and really find the core elements that appeal to me, so that I can work with that and make it something very personal for me and hopefully something very personal for the audience as well. I really feel that my job is to interpret it and pass it on. And I feel that back from them. When it's being received well, I do feel that, and it's a wonderful sort of reciprocal feeling. And it is magical. It's very meditative, actually, to play Bach to a crowd that's really listening. In 1717, the Duke... he sent Bach to jail. Bach, he was arrested in Weimar, because he wanted to break a contract. And for one month he was in jail, incarcerated. When he was in jail, he decided to start the Well-Tempered Clavier. So, the one month Bach spent in jail perhaps was the most important month in musical history. Yes, in my life I had so many troubles. First, I lost my right hand. When I lost my right hand, I told myself, "Well, I can play with my left hand. "I can do transcriptions. "I can play the Chaconne, the Brahms transcription." And then I lost my left hand, too. And then I didn't know where could I go. At that time I realized that I could conduct, and this was the importance of Bach in my life. He kept me alive. And today if I can use only my thumb, I try to play some of his music. For a young student, it's like magic for them. But you have to use something inside of yourself, that you cannot explain. You cannot explain with words. You only can explain with the inspiration of your mind, with the inspiration of your heart. Bach, with two notes, one on the right hand, the other with the left hand, he can build a cathedral. Bach's life, and the output of music that he graced us all with, is still, I think, unprecedented. Exploring the violin for the first time, that had never been done. Certainly exploring the cello for the first time, it's remarkable that being essentially a single-lined instrument, that Bach, being the first composer truly to expose the magic of what a cello can do, was able to create multi voices and multiple harmonies with an instrument that is essentially able to play one line. The cello was a church bass until that moment in time. That's an innovator! Bach is alone amongst his contemporaries in having written suites just for solo cello, for four strings or five strings, and with those limited resources, somehow creating the sound of an orchestra. Bach seems to have been personally driven. He wanted to explore the musical ideas that he came up with to the absolute utmost. Bach seems to have valued hard work above everything else. That is, Bach had his own standards, which were completely separate, and shockingly different, from any of the other composers who were writing around the same time. The cello that I perform on is one of the rarer examples of cellos predating the Bach suites. It's thrilling to think when I'm playing this cello that these sounds were around during Bach's lifetime. I play these suites for my children. They are singing dances. They are movement pieces. I am amazed at the pure joy that one can feel with these dance rhythms. It doesn't surprise me at all that Bach was known to shake every bone in his body when conducting his own works. Bach's music does survive well when you transcribe it for other instruments. One of the earliest copies we have of the cello suites is actually made by an organist, not by a cellist. So, music for violin was being transcribed for lute, music for the cello was being transcribed for the organ. There was a lot of transcription happening at the time. I think this music is expressing something that we all feel, that we all have inside, even people who are not necessarily classical music lovers or Bach lovers. If you manage to get really inside this music, it's overwhelming. There's probably no more intellectual form of music as a fugue, when you have this one line that's played and it comes back again, and it comes back again, in different levels. I mean, it's a very simple way to explain it but that's basically the beginning of what a fugue is. That's very rational, intellectual, as intellectual as it can be. And still what he's able to do within that, the freedom that he finds, the emotions. In my mind there's no limit to what it can express. To me, it begins and ends with being human, his music. To me, that's what it's about. Like so much of Bach's music, there's this relentlessness, this kind of Lutheran persistence that, you know, he just keeps pushing the point. Whether it's a fugue and the subject keeps building and building and building, it becomes more beautiful every time you come back to it. That sort of thing, I think, happens all the time in Bach's music. He knows how to grab an idea, and really work it. There's a great deal of Bach's music that has such architecture to it, that you think, well, the same class of people that were building these fantastic baroque cathedrals and these incredibly complicated organs, Bach was in a way a part of that movement, and a lot of the music that he wrote was in service of that kind of industrial energy. That doesn't mean that it's without a tremendous amount of emotional content because it certainly is. But there was a big part of Bach's musical life that was kind of like being a great engineer, somebody who could do for a dime what any normal genius would do for a dollar. At the core of a lot of Bach's music, I think you find a very pious and humble man who felt that his work was in the service of a better life and a better purpose. And there are elements of Bach's music that are so uplifting that in a way it's hard to feel that there isn't something more divine tugging us up when we hear Bach. To me one of the great miracles of music is when you write a piece of music and play a piece of music, and things really work, you can share a moment with the people that you're playing for, and it's a moment that's so vivid that you will remember it with perfect clarity for the rest of your life. And the thing that's even more amazing is that that music can be picked up years later or centuries later and have the same effect on groups of people. It's a way of connecting something that is very important at a kind of mythic and spiritual level in people across many centuries. It's perfectly understandable to feel that you're sticking your toe in some water that has run very deep for very many years across many, many, many generations of people, and it's one of those things that's hard to express, and maybe it's best expressed just by reveling in those great musical moments. The Art of Fugue was one of the last pieces that Bach wrote. And it was not just like sound. It was more of an emotion. I think that playing Bach is a more internalized experience compared to maybe some other composers. Whenever I play at senior centers, I tend to think of an opportunity to share Bach. I think I bring a sense of rejuvenation and freshness. Bach didn't complete this piece. He died before he completed the last countrapunctus, and I think that this piece kind of relates to old age. Old people can still relate to it in many many different ways, and how they can create their own emotions and their own feelings. The music that Bach wrote at the very end of his days, it's impossible not to be affected by it. But it is astonishing because by that point in his life, Bach had done everything in music, and he'd seen everything that a worldly person could experience in those times. His last will and his testament were his last works. As inevitably he began to confront his own mortality, and was suffering with infirmities, and dealing with blindness, he began to be forced to dictate his pieces. And he put a lifetime of wisdom into them and as much attention as he could, and of course they're colored with all of the feelings that he had as he was coming to the end of his time. Great music has a way of keeping you on your toes mentally and emotionally, and the Art of the Fugue, and Vor deinen Thron, pieces like that, are among the most astonishing things ever produced by one of the most astonishing musicians who ever lived. Something very special is going on in this particular piece of music. You feel as if you're being lifted up, carried along on this wave of inspiration. I can't help but think that he's striving for a higher plane, and it's not just a higher plane of intellect, but of spiritual involvement. When you come to the last few measures of that final fugue, in which Bach has revealed something very intimate about himself by using his own signature, the B-A-C-H theme, there's an overwhelming emotional effect. Perhaps he was saying something about himself that there's something almost autobiographical about this final summation of his life's work. The Art of the Fugue unfolds through an exploration of a wide variety of contrapuntal techniques. The simplicity of this opening fugue subject, on which the whole work is built, and where he was striving for something ever more complex, ever greater. I can't help but think that he has lifted all of us up onto a higher spiritual plane, along with his own striving toward that plane. It is the pure contemplation of infinite possibilities. I think that's what the Art of the Fugue is about. But time eluded him and he did not actually finish this last fugue. And it breaks off in mid-phrase. There is a shattering emotional effect and I think it's partly because we know he died before he could finish it. Bach's son, Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach, said that at this moment the creator of these fugues died. The last thing that he ever did write was a chorale that was included in the first edition of the Art of the Fugue. And this chorale creates a very spiritual feeling, and represents a sense of cosmic harmony, a sense of oneness with the universe. When you have those ecstatic moments in Bach's music, that uplift, that feeling of transcendence, it was something that started to happen more and more when I would just sort of submit to all these voices swirling around. It was almost like I was forgetting that I was playing music, and I realized, "Whoa! You're in another place now." There is something about the music of Bach that does transcend, something that rings so true when you hear music that's based on something small like that. And to develop this - It stimulates the mind and perhaps it imitates life itself. Scientists are constantly trying to find the basic laws of physics. There are only a hundred or so elements and they make up every single compound in the universe. Or the DNA, only made up of four nucleotides, but those four little things in different combinations make up our entire DNA. So I think there's something very appealing as human beings when we see this kind of thing happen. And that's what happens in Bach's music. The poetry of mathematics and the poetry of science is to me in the neighborhood of the poetry of music. Look at the Art of the Fugue. It's a catalogue of musical manipulation. To be able to do that, it's like a gymnast who can walk on a high wire, and somehow the wire isn't there. It's gone. It's just in space. He was way out. Bach was way out there! Music and math are intimately related. What they do share is an abiding respect for the power and the importance of pattern recognition, whether it's in a sequence of numbers or in a sequence of notes. Bach did appear to think like a mathematician because the techniques he used all have analogues in the world of classical geometry. But it can also possess characteristics of fractal geometry. The term fractal was coined by the mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot. It deals with the concept of self-similarity. What this means is that if you zoom into such an object, you see more and more structure that resembles the object as a whole. From bacterial colonies to the distribution of galaxies in the universe, an incredible variety of natural phenomena exhibit fractal structure. And in that respect perhaps Bach best reflected the world around him, the fractal nature of the world around him. Bach believed that the microcosmic order must be mirrored in the macrocosmic. It's not surprising then, that the Art of Fugue is in some sense composed of smaller copies of itself. All of us want to find a connection to something greater than ourselves. Scientists find that through the glory of nature. Musicians, we find it through music. And for me, music is my religion. And when you listen to Bach, it brings you, it shows you what many people would call God. I would call Truth. And it sort of tells you about life and about the world in a way that nothing else can. There's a wonderful story about Carl Sagan and the Voyager I spacecraft our first attempt at communicating with beings beyond our solar system. He was talking to Dr. Lewis Thomas about what kinds of things he should include. Lewis suggested, "I think we should send all of Bach, "but of course we would be bragging.” People often refer to the timelessness of Bach. At this very moment the Voyager is speeding through the galaxy with Bach as our emissary.
